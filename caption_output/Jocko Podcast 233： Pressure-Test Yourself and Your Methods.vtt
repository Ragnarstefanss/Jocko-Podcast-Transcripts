1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Jockel podcast number 233.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel willing, good evening echo.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So the last podcast we were reviewing a book about the Boer Wars

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we were going to pick up where we left off last time,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is what the British did with the lessons that they learned,

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the military reforms that they made,

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and how they made this transition and then where it ended up

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in World War I.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So the name of the book is the Boer War and Military Reforms

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
by J. Stone and Irwin Schmittel.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And let's take it back to the book.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So picking up where we left off.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is the, this is when they start talking about the,

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the reforms that got made.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
From the top down appointments were made in a casual,

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
random manner that often resulted in matching of poor,

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and poor matching of personality skills or personal

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
inclimations, inclinations to the demands of a particular post.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So the way that they were appointing officers was just kind of random.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And then the way they were matching up teams was also kind of random.

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And then you take the wrong personalities and mix them together.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You're not going to end up with good leadership.

24
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Continuing on, if locating and assigning qualified officers

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to proper post proved a problem,

26
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the same must be said of the selection of individual units

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and even private soldiers.

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What unico-heasin had existed vanished quickly in South Africa.

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Littleton's division for no apparent reason,

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
shrink in a few weeks from eight battalions to five and a half.

31
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Regiments were broken up into smaller units.

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Then reconstituted into mixed battalions.

33
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This was done with a seeming disregard of structural and historic uniformity

34
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
with adverse consequences on a spreder core in an army with strong

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
rencha mental ties.

36
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So they take a bunch of teams.

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They get to South Africa and they split them all up and mix them all up.

38
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is just a bad move.

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I used to be, I used to feel like I was kind of cheating a little bit.

40
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
When it came to when it wouldn't task you to bruise her,

41
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it was going through our pre-deployment workup.

42
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Because we would split up and we'd mix up.

43
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But when we had to do a training operation,

44
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we would get in our units and we'd stick to them for the most part.

45
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Because it was just so much better.

46
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So much better.

47
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
When you're working with people you work with.

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And they just threw that out the window here.

49
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Yeah.

50
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Wait, you said you felt like you're cheating?

51
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Yeah, I felt like I was cheating.

52
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah.

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Because it was so much more of a fact.

54
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It was just such an advantage.

55
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And they'd try and give us multiple targets where it would.

56
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Where you could kind of convince yourself that it would be a good idea to take these guys

57
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and move them over to this platoon and take these and just know.

58
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well, we'll just stick with the platoon integrity.

59
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Yeah.

60
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And I'm not saying that you shouldn't do interoperability because you should.

61
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And you should be able to mix people up.

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But you should also have that kind of baseline.

63
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And there's a reason that the regimental historical a spree to court.

64
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That's real.

65
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Continued on bureaucratically, the system was a nightmare as an official account of manpower was

66
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
was sometimes lost for months at a time.

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The lack of coherence was not due to want of paperwork.

68
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
For if anything, the pre-war structure was overly centralized.

69
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
In 1898, the broaderic committee on decentralization, heard testimony from the general commander

70
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
at Aldershot that it took 12 signatures, including two orders from London to return an unsatisfactory driver.

71
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So you got some micro management going on, some centralized command.

72
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
That's never good.

73
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Fast forward a little bit.

74
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Staff work with us fell on about 70 officers, some well trained, but many useless, although pleasant aristocrats.

75
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Boller later claimed that in Pretoria, I found Robert sitting in one building with his Hindu staff,

76
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Kitchener and another with his Egyptian staff and Kelly Kenny, in a third with an English staff, all pulling against one another.

77
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
With so many centers of control functioning at once, it should come as no surprise that time and again key points would be left on guarded, isolated,

78
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but tines on supported or critically needed guns on assigned the saving grace to an otherwise chaotic system was Robert's phenomenal memory and attention to detail.

79
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So you got these guys that have their own little silo set up, you know, you got Kitchener that had worked in Egypt and worked with the Egyptians and he brought them into South Africa and same thing with Robert's with his Hindu staff.

80
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
They all had their own little clicks.

81
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
That's not going to work out good. You're not working together.

82
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Troops and because of that, fast forward a little bit. Troops sometimes went hungry, cavalry lacked, sometimes lack courses and hospital arrangements rarely proved adequate.

83
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Kitchener's misunderstanding of staff principles was the best demonstrated where when he wrote about the battlefield, imposing his will,

84
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
rather than staying at his headquarters and manifesting it through properly organized staff channels.

85
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So again, that means he doesn't trust his people, he's out there on the battlefield trying to tell people exactly what to do and what kind of oversight or you're giving when you're out there on the battlefield,

86
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
barking orders at people to tell him exactly what to do.

87
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm not going to work out well.

88
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Alan, be summed up, summed up the view of a commander of a subordinate column by noting one is always at high pressure, one is probably under the same general for about a month at a time,

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
when he is played about and not one's column derags he goes off.

90
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
That's what the subordinates were saying.

91
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh, you're going to show up here for a month. You're going to bark orders. You're going to yell. It tells do stuff when we're all worn out. You're going to bail.

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The drawbacks of Kitchener's system are obvious over centralization isolation from the field and time lags.

93
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
After a year of frustration, Kitchener agreed to the appointment of Ian Hamilton as Chief of Staff.

94
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This was an admission that given the greater size complexity and distances of modern warfare coupled with extreme dispersion of forces that no individual could single-handedly run an entire war.

95
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But that was a year deep.

96
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This is something that works. That's something I see a lot as people that are people that they're too egotistical to say, hey, you know what it needs, I need to hire number two.

97
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's all it is. It's just ego kicking in.

98
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000
They talk about running the rail road because that was a big part and the British really didn't have the capability.

99
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They didn't have that in there in their capabilities of, hey, we need to run this rail.

100
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The British military needs to run a rail road and they didn't really have that capability.

101
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Also, circled one note in here about the fact that what Roberts ultimately did was resort to having hostages, civilians on the trains to try and keep them safe.

102
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Interesting advancement here. The soldiers benefited from the first individual field dressing kits and identification cards. This information proved so useful.

103
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000
That in 1906 dog tags were introduced. So there's the introduction of dog tags in the world. I thought that was interesting. They also found that the Royal Army Medical Corps.

104
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So they realized some of the things that they needed to do from a medical perspective. Another thing they say here, a major complaint of medical officers was the enormous amount of red tape,

105
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Surgeon spoke of an inability to operate because of long hours spent behind the desk.

106
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Check out this statistic. Over the course of the war, pay water and sanitation were largely responsible for an annual sickness rate of 958 men per thousand.

107
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So almost every single person you are going to get sick and they're not reporting like minor cults. They're reporting hey, this guy was out of duty.

108
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So that's why all the support people out there that are listening to this. All the military support people out there.

109
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Doesn't happen if you're not there logistics wins wars. You can't win a war if everyone's sick.

110
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Fast forward a little bit in all of the in all areas that changes rot by the Boer war or by no means limited to higher organization nor to big ticket items such as larger guns, hospitalships or armored chains trains.

111
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Assuming we minor changes occur as well. What stand out are the changes in the mundane

112
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:08.000
items of soldierly life such as uniforms and personal equipment. Perhaps the most obvious of these was the evolution toward uniformity of battlefield attire among all types of troops.

113
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The adoption of the India inspired khaki colored drill field uniforms by all except the Highlanders economy and camouflage potential became the new standard of production yet it was only with the widespread use of smokeless powder that these qualities could take precedence.

114
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Previously rapid fire weapon tree had been restricted by the heavy smoke that would cover battlefield under those circumstances camouflage uniforms seem super superfluous and needlessly unattractive.

115
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So this is where you start getting camouflage uniforms because before there'd be so much smoke on the field that it was just pointless to even have camouflage. No one could see you anyway.

116
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So you might as well look good. If you're a Brit.

117
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Pre-war dress standards in the British army had always emphasized excessive smartness to the point of making it the most unservisable and unwarkable in the world.

118
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:12.000
In the eyes of some contemporaries perhaps the most pernicious effect of smartness. So they had these really nice looking uniforms which were totally unfunctional.

119
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
However, there was a need to discipline men to take cover during pre-war training. Having to pay for damaged uniforms discouraged ready to use the ground.

120
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So these guys were having these uniforms that were so nice that during training they wouldn't want to get on the ground.

121
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Regarding the rest of the kit whenever possible is lightened including the adoption of aluminum canteen first developed in Germany.

122
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So they're making stuff.

123
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is why some of these things this we start getting the first modern war. You know there's a couple wars that you can talk about with that.

124
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Were the first modern war? These are some of the things that make you start saying, this is these are legit movements forward toward modern war.

125
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000
To outfit an entire army in the same manner had advantages aside from ease of supplying economy.

126
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Now this is I made a quick note here.

127
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I always talk about decentralized, right? decentralized command everything's going to be decentralized and it does.

128
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That being said, some things should be centralized and if they're not centralized there's going to be problematic.

129
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.000
For instance, do we want everyone in our platoon of 40 guys? Do we want everyone to have different weapons? What do you think?

130
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
No, no we do not. We want everyone to have the same weapon. So where are we going to get that weapon from?

131
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:50.000
We want to be decentralized. The same weapon we all have the same parts. We all have the same ammunition. That's what we want. We don't want everyone carrying their own different type of weapon.

132
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Uniform same thing. We want everyone to look the same medical kit. Where is that medical kit going to go on your gear?

133
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You want it in the same spot. So if you get shot, I'd come over. I know where your medical kit is. So there's some things that absolutely have to be centralized.

134
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So occasionally, like I'll be working with a company, and there's someone that doesn't want to kind of you. Doesn't want to use whatever standard doesn't want to follow some procedure.

135
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And I always have to bring this up, you know, that there's some procedures absolutely have to be centralized.

136
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
When you're in the battle of Ramadi, you have near and far recognition signals.

137
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You want everybody to know what those are. You know, and we had everybody in Ramadi knew what the recognition signal was from a long ways away.

138
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We all, everybody knew Army Marine Corps, everyone of the same thing. Believe me, you want that centralized. You don't want 12 seals going out on an operation.

139
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And they have a different recognition signal than the Army guys. So yes, there are times when things must be centralized.

140
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Of course, fast forward a little bit, the essential piece of equipment for all ranks in virtually all services was now the rifle.

141
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:14.000
More potent powders and improved smaller caliber bullet design made possible higher velocities and more precise shooting at ever increasing ranges.

142
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So this is we're using the rifle. That's what we're doing.

143
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Both sides, besides realize the potential of bicyclists as the boars distributor company of cyclists among their generous and the British cold cyclists from very units, various units and retrain two full battalions.

144
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Out there on their on their bikes getting after it.

145
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Imagine if they had modern mountain bikes and you know now they have the mountain bikes with the electrical with the electric boost. Have you seen those things?

146
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Hmm.

147
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
John Dudley, the hunter, the hunter.

148
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
He uses one of those things to get out to different hunting locations. Why?

149
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Very, it's quiet. It's silent. Can take it anywhere. It's light.

150
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It's, it's viable.

151
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Yeah, it's totally viable.

152
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Yeah, communication was perhaps one of the most consistent problems encountered in a swift moving war fought over tens of thousands of square miles of terrain.

153
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
For messages to Europe, the ocean, it cables sufficed but within South Africa, telegraph cables were often cut.

154
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Thus, signal flags were used but had limited ranges of eight kilometers and transfer rates of eight words per minute.

155
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Much preferred was the heliograph with a range of over 40 miles on clear terrain and a speed of 12 words per minute.

156
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Heliographs had the advantage of being undetectable if not in direct line of sight. What's a heliograph you might wonder?

157
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
It's a mirror.

158
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's a mirror. You're using a little mirror to reflect and send Morris code or whatever.

159
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
40 miles. You got to have some altitude to do that because the horizon is 12 miles.

160
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So big is that what? Like this?

161
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I have no idea.

162
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I think it's bigger. It must have been some kind of machine with a little amaranic.

163
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Well, too, if you're talking for miles, that's like huge then.

164
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
That's not the kind of carrying in your pocket.

165
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Well, after the blocks of take a historical look at the heliographs of the past 40 miles.

166
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Well, let me get it.

167
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It would have to be trash cancels.

168
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
At least. I think trash can't lay it in.

169
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Could be.

170
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Could be.

171
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Looking to the other.

172
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Can you imagine the number one form of communication that you have is using a mirror and reflecting it towards your body? Who's 40 miles away?

173
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
By the way, this is what?

174
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
100 and 100 years ago, 110 years ago, something like that.

175
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And now we got an iPhone or a pocket we can talk to people in space and health.

176
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000
War time experience clearly showed the need for better equipment for reconnaissance communication and ranging.

177
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So there you go. Those are some of the reforms.

178
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Now we dip into a little bit more tactical stuff.

179
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
During the course of the brewer war, every branch of the British army experimented.

180
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Experience to change and nowhere was this more evident than in tactics.

181
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
For the infantry, the foremost consideration was the enormous increase in firepower.

182
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Proper maneuvering and deployment which could lead to initial superiority of position or psychological advantage became even more important.

183
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
As concentrated rapid fire had become so devastating that once battle had been joined,

184
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
nearly impossible to rectify any initial year errors without suffering serious casualties.

185
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Battles were now resolved in uneven pace. A few minutes at a tactical disadvantage could prove more decisive than hours of marginal superiority.

186
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:07.000
What are we talking about there? What we're talking about is, all of a sudden, if you got the tactical advantage, you were at a massive advantage,

187
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
not a little one, a massive one. And you could get yourself to a position through this speed,

188
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
surprising violence of action. You could get if you used speed, surprise,

189
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
violence batching and you got the advantage, you were at a massive advantage.

190
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
A massive advantage.

191
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Marksmanship was fast forward a little bit. Marksmanship was becoming a matter of soldier selecting individual targets and ranges rather than collective mass volley fire.

192
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And this in turn, necessitated a new type of training for one as for his one,

193
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:47.000
boor noted of 35 men whom we took prisoners after they had fired up to add us up to 350 paces,

194
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
not a single one had his site correct.

195
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Most of them in kept their sights at 800 and 850 yards because no order to change had been given.

196
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
That's centralized. That's centralized command. You're at 350 yards. You imagine your capturing.

197
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
By the way, just in case you don't notice, when you have your sights set for 850 yards or 800 yards and you're shooting at someone that's 300 yards away,

198
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
you're not going to hit him. That's not happening. You're going to miss him.

199
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So imagine you come, you capture your opponent and they don't even have their sight set and you ask him why not?

200
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Well, we didn't get ordered to. Crazy. Keep your weapons dope.

201
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:43.000
The British infantry drill of 1896 had placed two little emphasis on the firefight and too much on depth of formations.

202
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
At Clenesso, the boor's were outnumbered for the one yet less than a third of the British army was involved in the attack.

203
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
The boor's understood modern small arms. Captain Wrightman and American military observer noted,

204
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I did not learn of any case when the boor's had determined to hold their ground that the frontal attacks succeeded by its own power.

205
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
So what are we hearing right here? We're kind of hearing a little bit of that flanking movement coming in to play. Big time.

206
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Never heard of the frontal attack working.

207
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Am I going to tell you the frontal attack never works? I'm not going to tell you that. I'm going to tell you though.

208
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:36.000
You best be leaning towards flanking maneuvers. The futility of the old attacks in front of the assault was compounded by an infantry termed by the times by the time history as being in different shots.

209
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Careless of cover slow to comprehend what was taking place or to grasp the whereabouts of the enemy always surprised or lost helpless without their officer. In a word, well disciplined but ill-trained.

210
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
One might say untrained. Think about those descriptions.

211
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
How would you like your military unit to be described as indifferent shots you can't hit anything?

212
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Careless of cover you're not protecting yourself slow to comprehend what was taking place needs no explanation or to grasp the whereabouts of the enemy.

213
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
You don't even know where the bad guys are always surprised or lost.

214
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
That's a nightmare helpless without their officer. These are the worst descriptions of amongst the worst descriptions that you can give.

215
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And then what's interesting is that in order to well disciplined, and you know me, disciplines at the top of my list. But if you're so well disciplined, but you can't think for yourself, you're worthless.

216
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:44.000
The provisional course of musketry for the year 1902 took the bold step of abolishing the volley.

217
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So now we're not going to get online anymore and shoot on command as well as encouraging fire from cover and the use of any kind of rest natural artificial sound. That's the first little step they're taking.

218
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And I want you to pay attention as a little bit 1902.

219
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:08.000
So now they're starting to take the lessons from the brewer war and say, okay, guess what? We need to learn not to fire from cover. We need to start shooting individually.

220
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000
And the reason I say pay attention to that date is that they're going to make changes and then they're going to regret back.

221
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.000
They're kind of going to go to what you know. It's like, you know, when you get the you get the wrestler.

222
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And he's going against a sick jujitsu guy and you say, look, don't take this guy down. You got better hands.

223
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And then he gets caught with a little shot and what does he do? It goes right back to what he kind of knows. We're at the trap.

224
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000
It's a trap. Your habits are a trap.

225
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Continuing on the defenses increased power drastically reduced troop densities.

226
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So how many people do we have on the battlefield? We're starting to spread out.

227
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Wellington had fought Waterloo with 69,000 men on a two mile frontage.

228
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
The boorers had held their front front with only 300 men to the mile.

229
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Did you hear that? 69,000 for two miles and 300 men to a mile?

230
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
That's how much different it was. That's how dispersed they got.

231
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Continuing on a little bit larger, more dispersed battlefields destroyed the ability of a single general to command a battle.

232
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And even in the most broad of terms, I'm going to say that again, larger, more dispersed battlefields destroyed the ability of a single general to command a battle even in the most broad of terms.

233
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So you got all these people that spread out over 300 miles.

234
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And you got to communicate with a freaking mirror. Right? You're not going to. So what you need to learn how to use decentralized command.

235
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
You need to learn how to give commanders intent.

236
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Greater Alliance had to be put on lower echelon officers and NCOs.

237
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Frequently non-professional officers were expected to lead by personal example in battle.

238
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
This disproportionate, their disproportionate losses testified to this role.

239
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Under South Africa's fluid battle conditions, small unit command became more critical. And this is the same way the military is now.

240
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
You can't expect a platoon commander that's out there in the battle of Ramadi. He's out there.

241
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
He's not, he's making decisions. He's making calls.

242
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
At least that's the way it should be. Does communication, modern communication start to allow for micro management to take place?

243
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Yes, it absolutely does. Which one?

244
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Alpha 2. Which direction are you moving? I want you to be 200 meters.

245
00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:01.000
It's not taking to 200 meters. That's what can happen nowadays. It's not good.

246
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
In South protection and for the good of the army officers began to leave their countrymen.

247
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
It's behind and play a less conspicuous role in advance. So now we're not wearing our badges that say we're in charge.

248
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Roll models such as Bullar who remained in the thick of the fighting at Kalenso until wounded became a thing of the past.

249
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Senior officers now kept further to the rear and the tactical role of Junior officers was enhanced.

250
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000
In the early months of the war, the British were fortunate in that their unique organizational pattern of eight small companies per battalion allowed them to have sufficient

251
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
complement of officers to whether the heavy early losses.

252
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
But yes, so now we're moving more toward decentralized command.

253
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Interestingly, it was the volunteers and militia. So the volunteers and militia, you remember these are like the reserves people that were doing part time.

254
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:03.000
They proved most adaptable to new forms of warfare probably because of their closer ties to the civilian mode of thinking.

255
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:20.000
They have opened minds at the bottle of Dorn, the city of London Imperial volunteers advanced to by rushes and used covering fire while the guards were still moving forward in relatively dressed line cover move.

256
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I love getting to the root of things.

257
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Like it, that's, that's, that's, it's not incredible. You have these civilians that are reservists and they go, hey guess what, you shoot all move.

258
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
They didn't even taught that. They figured it out. You shoot all move when I get in a good spot. I'll shoot you move. Ready go.

259
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Meanwhile, the pros, the Gordon's were already, all rise, all forward, march. That's what they're doing.

260
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Yeah, it's like their creativity was trained out of a certain creativity was trained out.

261
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Always have to give that warning about discipline inside of a unit.

262
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Because if you have so much discipline inside of a unit, people stop thinking, yeah, and that's the last thing as a leader that's the last thing you want.

263
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
It's the last thing you want anywhere, right? You have a company. You don't want people to stop thinking about how to do things better.

264
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
You have a GJ2 school. You want everyone just to learn the moves that you teach them and not think of anything? No.

265
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Creativity should be nurtured. Creativity should be watered.

266
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:34.000
It should grow and rewarded. You know, like you're thinking back to that way, you just said about like they didn't adjust their sights because they weren't ordered to.

267
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So you've ever watched coming to America?

268
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Yes. So in the beginning, he was ready Murphy and Murphy are senior hall.

269
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Yes, sir. So he was going to get married. What do you call it?

270
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.000
A ring marriage marriage marriage, where his wife is going to be like the ultimate servant wife, right?

271
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And essentially, she was like those people not adjusting the sights because they weren't ordered to because this lady was going to do everything.

272
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Like everything that he wanted, everything will think.

273
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And she proved it or whatever. Just real briefly, it kind of went and noticed this little part, but it made it kind of basically the same point.

274
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So this movie had a lasting impact on your philosophies. Continue.

275
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Well, I'm telling you, there's nuggets and Easter eggs in there all in there. So he was like, hey, so you're going to do everything.

276
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
You know, he was like, hey, let me talk to you for a minute. Right in the middle of the marriage ceremony.

277
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Let me talk to you for a minute in the back room, whatever.

278
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And he's like, she's like, yeah, your service, whatever. And he's like, hey, so I want to get to know you and she's like, yeah, I've just been raised to serve you.

279
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
He's like, what kind of stuff you like, she's like, whatever you like. He's like, dang.

280
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
He's like, so anything I tell you to do, you'll do. She's like, yep.

281
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
It's like anything I tell you what you'll do. She's like, yep, like happy too.

282
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
She's, she's, she's, so he's like, hey, barked like a dog. She starts barking like a dog.

283
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
He's like, uh, who, like, I rang a tang or something like this. She starts doing. He's like,

284
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Just hop on one leg. She starts doing it all at once, right?

285
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And he's like, all confused.

286
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
His dad walks in.

287
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Like, all you guys are getting along with whatever. And he's like, um, he's like, oh, please excuse us to the wife, right?

288
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Me and was she still hopping on one leg and not hooting like our anger tang. Still didn't get ordered to stop that.

289
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So I, he's like, hey, can you excuse us? You think she'd be like, okay, thanks.

290
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
So walk out. She hops out. Still doing the ring a tang thing. You seem saying.

291
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
She didn't get ordered to stop. Same thing.

292
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Even though it'd be kind of common knowledge, but she was trained her whole life to follow his orders.

293
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Same thing. Same thing. It's interesting that that scene from that movie from 1984 or 86.

294
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
So whatever. Has just been floating around in your brain.

295
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Wait, negate grab the arm to find a poor warmth.

296
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I'm spra- I'm telling you.

297
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And the London Imperial volunteers. Yes, same thing.

298
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Well, their creativity versus the Gordon's who are just hopping on one leg and hooting like our anger tangs.

299
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Or what happens? Because they weren't ordered. Well, the point there is these concepts are everywhere.

300
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
You got to watch out. Yeah, same same. So I'm with you.

301
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Be careful. The lap just like was that Eddie Murphy's character or our senior halls character.

302
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
In that scene? Yes. Eddie Murphy.

303
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Just like Eddie Murphy didn't want someone that lacked creativity.

304
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
You as a leader do not want people that just are going to follow orders.

305
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yeah. I know it's hard to understand that. But it's true.

306
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Yeah, after watching that movie, I understand it's more clear for sure.

307
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
But that's well, was part of the point though of the movie.

308
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Literally your analogy is proved by all authorities.

309
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
It's impressive.

310
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
It's...

311
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Continuing on.

312
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
The agile infantry of 19...

313
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
The agile infantryman of 1901 who ran and crawled across the battlefield relatively unencumbered

314
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
by bulky equipment and directed primarily by whistles was in marked contrast to the 1893 image of the professional soldier,

315
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
which still pervaded many of the regulations.

316
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
So by 1901 they had advanced. They were moving. They were... they were traveling lighter.

317
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Advanced is where now made under the cover of rolling barrage.

318
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And what is that? That's when you're launching artillery at people.

319
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
So the enemy gets their head down and that's how you're going to move.

320
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
That's cover move.

321
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
First demonstrated at the Battle of Peter's Hill.

322
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Early, earlier methods that depended on accurate low angle of fire of shrapnel and high explosives on enemy positions proved ineffective.

323
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.000
The avoidance of independent, a frontal attacks wherever possible became matter of universal consensus.

324
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
As presented in infantry drill.

325
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
So they have by...

326
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
The end of the war realized frontal attacks no good.

327
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Psychological preparation for the bayonet assault went far beyond the military training and was reflected in numerous contemporary accounts and drawings.

328
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
That such occurrences were rare was of little relevance.

329
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Interesting that the boor is claimed contempt for cold steel as no position or peace of terrain seemed worth dying for.

330
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Europeans used to fighting in far more restricted areas under strict discipline,

331
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
what on occasion stand in the defend position to the death.

332
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So this is the weird thing that they... they kept...

333
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
They kind of kept this idea behind the bayonets and the cold steel.

334
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
So there's an American journalist named Julian Raoff and he had this little quote.

335
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:50.000
We have learned that even British vowler displayed by a number of men equal to the foe is of no conclusive value under the new condition.

336
00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And that if all modern armies could entrench themselves and then and could then compel their enemies to meet them in frontal attack war would be abandoned as soon as possible.

337
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Our sorry would be abandoned as impossible.

338
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
What he's saying there is if you could get in an entrench position and get your enemy to attack you,

339
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
war would be abandoned because it would seem impossible.

340
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
You're not going to be able to take out these positions not against and what's crazy.

341
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
This is what world war one is.

342
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Entrench positions attack. It doesn't work.

343
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
A trench position attack doesn't work. Doesn't work.

344
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And this guy, this American journalist is saying this.

345
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
And in 1902.

346
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Previously the British were hesitant to adopt field entrenchments despite numerous contemporary experiences to the contrary.

347
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
They feared that a defensive psychology bred by reliance on field works and by field works.

348
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
They mean trenches and ditches and foxholes did not bold well for a victorious army.

349
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Like that's a negative attitude.

350
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
That's pattern right.

351
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Digging in. That means we're defending. We're not defending. We're going on offense.

352
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Bullards famous prewar jack in the box memorandum.

353
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
And which I look for. I couldn't find it.

354
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
It's perhaps the most indicative of the English way of war.

355
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Battles he felt could not be won by officers or men who ducked in action.

356
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Think about that.

357
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
That's when you're telling your MMA fighter, hey bro.

358
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Don't you need to just go out there and throw punches.

359
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
And if you get hit, that's part of it. That's how you win because you're a man.

360
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Don't you don't need to move you don't know. Don't worry about head movement.

361
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Prewar army regulations recognize two types of entrenchments.

362
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000
The half hour and the one hour type, both of which were earth embankments and the one hour.

363
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
At what the one and a half feet high differing in width. So the only the only had the most you're going to dig it is half an hour.

364
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
You can't dig an effective fox hole in a half an hour. It's not happening.

365
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:14.000
The British infantrymen did not even carry a shovel and was a custom's perregulations to native laborers or engineering building any necessary entrenchments.

366
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
The final proof of this change in doctrine was the issuance of shovels to two thirds of the infantry and light picks to the remainder by 19.

367
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
So by 1903, they realize you know what? We got to give two thirds of these guys shoveling.

368
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
The others guys are going to pick axes.

369
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Entrenching tools.

370
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
It is ironic how many of the war's lessons for infantry could have been learned during peacetime.

371
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Be they the value of well constructed entrenchments or light and combat loads.

372
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
The enhanced difficulty of reconnaissance or the new dangers of the fires own.

373
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:59.000
The misplaced faith in the firing line is self sufficient protection at long ranges or the essential nature of the turning movement in combination with all frontal attacks.

374
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:09.000
If they would have trained that saying if they would have trained harder, they would have been able to figure a lot of this stuff out.

375
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Now as they looked at this, it's a quote here, the bulk of the British officers preferred to believe that failure was due to a lack of training and discipline.

376
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
So we start to get back. We start to head back in the wrong direction that saying hey look if our guys would have been more disciplined.

377
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Then they could have they could have done better.

378
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000
We're not quite so 100% sure about that.

379
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
It's the idea of you know what a jiu-jitsu move isn't working.

380
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Like if I'm showing you a foot walk and you're saying hey the guy you know the guy's not tapping.

381
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
And I look at your foot walk and I say do it harder.

382
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
That's my recommendation.

383
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Yeah. Same deal.

384
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.000
This is not good.

385
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Yeah.

386
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Go harder is not an effective way of correcting something that isn't working.

387
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I have I run this with businesses business.

388
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
We'll show me their strategy that they're using their marketing plan, their growth plan or whatever.

389
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
It's not working.

390
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And I say well so what are you going to do now?

391
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Well we're going to do it. We're going to put more money into it.

392
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.000
We're going to do it.

393
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
We're going to do it harder.

394
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Sometimes you need to overwhelming force.

395
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
But sometimes you've got to look at that and say wait we really haven't gotten anywhere.

396
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And now we're just going to go harder.

397
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Poor more assets into this.

398
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Squeeze harder on the foot.

399
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
How hard should you have to squeeze on the foot for it to work.

400
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
There's a different mistake that you're making.

401
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Let's figure out what that is.

402
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Yes.

403
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
When is the time to go harder maybe when it's kind of working?

404
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Yeah.

405
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
That's why I'm saying what are you getting?

406
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
If you're putting a foot lock on me and I'm not barely even reacting to it,

407
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
we're judging that as ineffective.

408
00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Yeah.

409
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And you start to squeeze hard maybe I feel a little bit but I'm barely still not even reacting.

410
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
If you see me start to react.

411
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Yeah.

412
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
What do you always say when you get some little moment of beauty with me?

413
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Mm-hmm.

414
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
You always go sense of earth's sense of earth's sense of earth's.

415
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
So if you see a sense of urgency you think oh okay.

416
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Maybe I could go a little bit harder to make that make something happen there.

417
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Yeah.

418
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Then it does feel like it depends kind of on how hard you're going to begin with.

419
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Because if you're maxing out and I sense a slight sense of urgency, I'm like man.

420
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Yeah.

421
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
If I go harder that might not be you know might be diminishing returns on that one.

422
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
So it's like so yes.

423
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Because you're contrast your output with your ROI and see if you should just go harder.

424
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Sometimes it's face it Brad just go harder and it'll work you know.

425
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Yeah.

426
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Sometimes it does.

427
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
But there's probably a mistake that you're making.

428
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Right.

429
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Most you get to moves you shouldn't have to you shouldn't have to you shouldn't get tired doing a

430
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Gigi to submission.

431
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Yeah.

432
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Right.

433
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I mean occasionally you like maybe some weird choke that your grip is getting tired.

434
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Yeah.

435
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
And then you're going to be doing a competition where you're kind of like maybe like you're focusing too hard on conservation or something like this.

436
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
And this guy's kind of picking up the pace on you and it's a competition so it's like you know a different environment.

437
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
You know in a way.

438
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
And then yeah, so maybe go a little bit harder.

439
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Even then it's like man you could you could think your way through that you know unless you're admittedly admittedly being lazy.

440
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Then you could you go harder.

441
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
At least a little bit.

442
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
When you're going to go harder you have to make sure that the direction that you're going is going to be fruitful.

443
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Yeah.

444
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:55.000
You ever when you're training like you get like let's say someone's on.

445
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Sure.

446
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
You know what you know you know I do this to kind of Greg train sure.

447
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
They kill get a good.

448
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
He put a bow and arrow choke on me.

449
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000
And I mean it was legit like he and I had you know I had like a little bit of his ghee and a little bit of my ghee.

450
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Yeah.

451
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And I just sat there and you know he went and we were already doing like six minute rounds.

452
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Yeah.

453
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
And he got it pretty quick.

454
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
You know he got it within let's say probably within two or three minutes.

455
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So he had three or four minutes of me.

456
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Yeah.

457
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
And I just kind of had the you know bit down and kind of flexed my neck and I'm holding his ghee and my ghee.

458
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
And I had I had pretty good grips on both.

459
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.000
You know what I mean like you know you happen to get like the you have I happen to get a good grip and Greg train admittedly is smaller than me as well.

460
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
But he went hard and harder for four minutes.

461
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And let's face it. What is the drop dead time for a bone arrow choke to work like at what point you say hey it's been 45 seconds.

462
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Yeah.

463
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And this guy did not tap and I put my knee in his back and I've arched hard and I pulled hard and this guy didn't tap.

464
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
The rest of probably from 45 seconds on is a waste of energy.

465
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Yes.

466
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Especially if you're pull if you're if you're maxed out.

467
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And the energy is to pull you know like that's it right there.

468
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
I mean that's not counting like you know because you can make adjustments and they could take like a good three minutes sometimes.

469
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
When you're like let me adjust here try okay I didn't worry.

470
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
He had entered the submission attempt.

471
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Yeah.

472
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
There's no longer setting up.

473
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
He had entered this submission.

474
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
This was to make me tap.

475
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Yeah.

476
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Yeah.

477
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
And I just sat there and so anyways.

478
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:59.000
I can't remember if he held on till the round ended. I don't think he did. I think you know with 30 seconds left he let go and we you know but he was just done after that.

479
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
He was so gasped.

480
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
He was gasped like he just did of 20 minute metcon.

481
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Check your ROI.

482
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Whatever. I can't help but kind of relate to him a little bit because you get into that position where the men the submissions in on jocco shoot.

483
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
You think I'm going to risk adjusting or a.

484
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
We're just standing in a youth no.

485
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
No, no, no, no, no.

486
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I'm going for straight up.

487
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
I'm be lining for that submission.

488
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
You're just going to maintain do or die.

489
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
But seriously, you get me in a bone arrow choke and there's been 45 seconds.

490
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Yeah.

491
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Think about how long 45 seconds this.

492
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Yeah. That's a long time.

493
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Yeah.

494
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And it doesn't work. You're going to keep pulling.

495
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
No.

496
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
You're not at all. You're not at job.

497
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
But I am saying that I can relate.

498
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Yeah.

499
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
With the attitude for sure.

500
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Well, I wonder did he see you did you see that you had that grip?

501
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Yeah.

502
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Yeah. So a lot of times, yeah, after the 45 seconds you're like,

503
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Brother, grip is jamming me up.

504
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
So that's the issue.

505
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
The issues in my choke.

506
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
It's that grip right there.

507
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
How good of a job.

508
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Did I do?

509
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Of giving him a false sense of hope.

510
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Right.

511
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Like how much did I go?

512
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Yeah.

513
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Right.

514
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
How much did I give that to him?

515
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Where he's thinking it must be close.

516
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Yeah.

517
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
No, that's, yeah.

518
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
That's such an interesting strategy.

519
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
I do that with the plane just laughs.

520
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Yeah.

521
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
No, that I'm mine.

522
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Yeah.

523
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Well, sometimes when you do it, it's like you have a ton of condescending.

524
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Yeah.

525
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
I do it to you.

526
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I absolutely will have a ton of condescending.

527
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
I'm just saying your move is ineffective.

528
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Yeah.

529
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
I was like,

530
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
You know, and you know, and you know,

531
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
You know,

532
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
That's my, it's my torment.

533
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Version.

534
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Back to the book.

535
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
There was, this is fast forward.

536
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
There was, however, one aspect of British passification policy that did cast,

537
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
lasting disgrace upon their methods, the concentration camps.

538
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
The military gave three pretexts for their existence.

539
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
First, they were meant to protect the isolated,

540
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Blue or families who's met a gone off to fight second.

541
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
They were meant to separate the commandos from the supplies and intelligence that their families could provide.

542
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And third, it was claimed that the subsequent isolation would force the burgers to surrender.

543
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
28,000 whites and 14,000 Africans died in these camps of various diseases.

544
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
The reasons for this disaster were many.

545
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Again, modern war.

546
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
This is our first real look at concentration camps.

547
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
And you know,

548
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
I, I don't know, I don't know what the intent is.

549
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
And we'll have to study more to find out the intent.

550
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
I could see both sides.

551
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I could see the intent of being those things that they talk about.

552
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Hey, we wanted to protect them.

553
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
We wanted to keep their supply lies separate.

554
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Like I could see that as the intent.

555
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
I could also see the intent as we've been here for two and a half years.

556
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And we're not winning.

557
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And we're going to break that or wheel to fight by by killing them, by putting these camps and making the lives miserable for their families.

558
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
That's, I mean, that's, I don't know what 27 movies you're about to bring up.

559
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
But you know, the move, where the movie is like, hey, you know, the cops ready to, ready to, you know, do something to the bad guy.

560
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And then they pull up in the car and there's the, there's the cops kid, right?

561
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Like they, they go to the family.

562
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Right. And that's what breaks the guy.

563
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
That's what makes him have to comply.

564
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
So it seems like maybe,

565
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
and again, I don't have the research on this, but I could see it being either way.

566
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
That the, the, the, the, the public facing, hey, we're just trying to protect them.

567
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
But behind the scenes, guess what, we're going to, we're going to take their families.

568
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And see how much they want to fight once we've got their families.

569
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
And that is jacked up and they admitted that that's why they kind of broke.

570
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
So one of the major reasons why they broke.

571
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
True lies.

572
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
True lies.

573
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
One of them, you know, do that.

574
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Um, Arnold, I'll just go to the, they have Jamie Lee Curtis in the end.

575
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
What do they do?

576
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
No, they took the daughter.

577
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Oh, isn't it one of the lethal weapon movies, too?

578
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Yep.

579
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Yep.

580
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
See, this is a common theme.

581
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
And brother, that's how. Yeah, that's a good move. Really? When you think about it, it's a good move.

582
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Yeah.

583
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
It's effective.

584
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
You get that. So that's what I'm saying. People call, you know what?

585
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
This is a good move.

586
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
We're going to get their families.

587
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And it's, and, and it's messed up.

588
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Even if they're intent wasn't to let them die and starve and dive disease,

589
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
even if they're intent wasn't to we just have your family.

590
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Yeah.

591
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
That's just jacked up, and it's all right.

592
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
The leverage.

593
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
You know,

594
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Mailbrew prisoners of war generally fared better than their family,

595
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
since the army had at least some experience in this area

596
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
and was aiming at reconciliation.

597
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
So, you got soldiers that go into prison of war,

598
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
at least they understand how to soldier,

599
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
at least they understand how to, at least they understand how to,

600
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
you know, clean and, and, and, and, and,

601
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
stay disease free.

602
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Where's the families had no idea?

603
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
By May 1902, after two and a half years of fighting,

604
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
the cost and morale, physical and monetary terms had made it to the same place.

605
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
The military terms had made itself felt on both sides,

606
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
the guerilla war had inflicted more than twice the casualties of the conventional phase on both sides.

607
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
A Trishin became the critical factor,

608
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
the deliberate destruction of 30,000 farms.

609
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Hundreds of square miles of farmland, three, or, sorry,

610
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
6.3 million sheep filled Britain with a sense of guilt.

611
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
The leader of the opposition was moved to question the supposed methods of

612
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
barbarism in parliament,

613
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
stripping the country had only hardened the booze reserve.

614
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Concentration camps proved both expensive and debilitating on the British's will to win.

615
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
So, you know, this is sort of like a Vietnam situation

616
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
where the people back in America are looking at what's going on in Vietnam

617
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
and seeing it as a nightmare.

618
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
And that's sort of what they're saying here,

619
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
that the British are seeing what's happening or hearing about what's happening.

620
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
And they're starting to have a sense of guilt about it.

621
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Not even the vast wealth of Britain could sustain the seemingly endless struggle in South Africa

622
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
in the face of increasingly uneasy, domestic and hostile international opinion.

623
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
So, you also got the world looking at it, what do you guys do in down there?

624
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
You got the women and children dying in concentration camps?

625
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
We're not okay with that.

626
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
The cumulative effect of these various factors was to soften the terms

627
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
ultimately offered to an accepted by the booze in May of 1902,

628
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
the reasons given for their surrender included the devastation of country,

629
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
fear of those in concentration camps,

630
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
and increasingly hostile native population lost in property

631
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
and an inability to keep British prisoners.

632
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
From the British perspective, these were more psychological than military causes for victory.

633
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
As late as since I'll think about that,

634
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
and we've covered that multiple military strategy taxes.

635
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Like you break the will of the people.

636
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
It's not a, hey, we beat you on the battlefield here, there or wherever,

637
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
but when you break their will psychologically,

638
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
that's how you're going to win.

639
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
And that's exactly what happened here.

640
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
As late as December 25, 1901,

641
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
the times of London still spoke of large areas of South Africa,

642
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
where columns of less than 600 men could be overwhelmed.

643
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Over 21,000 booers now laid down their arms to the British,

644
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
a force equal numbers to that with which they started the war.

645
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Of the 24,000 booers who died in the war,

646
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
only 4,000 could properly be judged as dying in combat.

647
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:06.000
The remaining 20,000 consisted primarily of women and children victims of the camps.

648
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:12.000
The British lost 22,000 men, two thirds of whom died from disease.

649
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:22.000
In the end, superior numbers of wealth and will to power had won out in conjunction with a radically reformed approach to modern warfare.

650
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And, again, this is a modern war where, you know, you've got civilians dying.

651
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:45.000
It's a freaking nightmare. And you also have the big Imperial power with all the strength and all the people and all the supplies.

652
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:58.000
You know, kind of coming to a draw with a bunch of peasants, with farmers, with untrained gorillas.

653
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.000
You know, like we're going to see, well, like we're going to see in Vietnam, like we're going to see in Afghanistan, like we're going to see in Iraq.

654
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Hmm.

655
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:22.000
The last section really gets into how this, how those things that were learned are put into play.

656
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And they talk about Robert's here and and what his emphasis was on administration and communication.

657
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And they actually started bringing naval officers in to help because naval officers had a good reputation for being, you know, good at communication, good at administration.

658
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:54.000
You know, that the navy, the navy is a very logistically heavy organization. You've got ships at sea.

659
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:02.000
They have to be fueled. You have sailors on board that need to be fed. There's a administrative part of it that is incredibly challenging.

660
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
And you got to do all this while you're on the ocean.

661
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
So they're good at that. The navy is very good at that.

662
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Robert's also eliminated outdated exams and encouraged personal evaluation of senior officers in order to get people advanced. So that was solid.

663
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Greater importance was placed on field work during the increasing numbers of maneuvers held in the decade after the war.

664
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:34.000
So after the war they're looking around on, we better train. We better fix the way we're training and we better fix who we're putting into these good positions.

665
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000
These officers are positions who we put in there.

666
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:53.000
It was claimed that of the 40,000 dead are wounded suffered by both sides in the war. Only 50 were a result of the sword or the lance.

667
00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:02.000
In the light of the Dickinson's committees finding that a more prominent position must be given to the training of cavalry soldier in the use of the fire weapon.

668
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:15.000
The carbine despite its greater lighter weight gave way to the longer ranged Lee and Field Short rifle. The British thus became the only rifle armed cavalry in Europe in 1914.

669
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:23.000
The survival of the sword as a secondary weapon. So they kept the sword on hand.

670
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Listen to this. You know that term stick in the mud. Yeah. Like all that guy's a stick in the mud. Doesn't want to change. No, it doesn't want to change. Hey, he's hey we're doing this new. We're going to start working, you know, go go plot it.

671
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
I like to stick with the old stuff. You know what I mean? Like stick in the mud. They don't want to change.

672
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Holy cow, I thought that meant useless like this whole time. Oh, no. Just stick in the mud.

673
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Yeah, stick in the mud.

674
00:52:46.000 --> 00:53:01.000
I mean, you don't want to change. The survival of the sword as a secondary weapon was a testament to its original pervasiveness and the disinclamation to waste all the material and training previously invested.

675
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
So they also have what's that bias called Mr. Bias.

676
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:19.000
You invested a lot into what is it lost investment bias. Oh, sunk cost fallacy. So here we go. They invest. They bottle these swords and then they trained all these people and how to use the swords. They're like, hey, we bottom we train people. We're going to stick with them.

677
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:26.000
It was claimed that the lands interfered with a very cavalry function saved the charge for it in combat dismounting firing concealment.

678
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Regardless inferior to the sword and protracted maylaes and difficult to master when little time or money could be spared for a third weapon. The lands was consigned to the dustbin of history.

679
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Maintenance of the sword on the other hand rested upon tradition.

680
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
It's cheapness as compared to a pistol and the fact that it was always loaded.

681
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Like I can I can I can put myself in the room to the military group that's sitting around talking of discussing should we get pistols or should we give swords and someone's someone's in the back.

682
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
You know, some old school guys in the back saying, what are you going to give these another gun they already have a gun.

683
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.000
What happens if they run out of bullets? You know what happens if they need to take time to load that thing your sword is always loaded.

684
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000
You know, and it's hey, well, you can't really argue with that and they're old man in the back wins and we keep keep keep making swords and keep training people in the swords.

685
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
So I thought that that was interesting.

686
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I don't know, so I have a section here saying it in snow fog and dusk or dawn that they still thought that the sword could win battles.

687
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
How big is that sword?

688
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000
I don't know probably just the normal length you think a sword to be like, you know, four three or four feet.

689
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Yeah, I don't know, seems big.

690
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
I have a navy sword.

691
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Seems cumbersome. It's ceremonial.

692
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Yeah, you know, can carry it around though.

693
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Right.

694
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
I did not carry my sword and come back.

695
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Yeah.

696
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
The return to more traditional cavalry tactics was fraught with difficulties.

697
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Years of training led to broad front of the tax to avoid concentric fire, concentric fire, meaning we're surrounding the area.

698
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:12.000
And we're starting to have blue on blue situations taking place. By 1911, it was clear that the reactionaries had won the day in the matter of cavalry tactics.

699
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Other armies constructed conscript infantry. It was bleed could never stand to charge. That's an arrogant statement.

700
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Hey, look, we will continue to do these mounted charges because of bunch of conscripts, drafties.

701
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
They're not going to withstand the charge.

702
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:37.000
You can hear the brish talking about no one would be able to withstand one of our charges at bunch of conscripts.

703
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Further more faith was placed in tactical imponderables, such as ammunition giving out, or that some local condition would lead to surprise or a major battlefield role, despite evidence to the contrary, provided by the blue or war.

704
00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:03.000
So they would still talk. I've been in so many of these conversations as things started new tactics come out.

705
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000
I've been in so many of these conversations because I was in training for a long time.

706
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000
I mean, I was in training as a young, enlisted seal for, I don't know, a couple years.

707
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:26.000
I was at training cell at CELT1, which was a good crew of guys. Master Chief faculty was in charge. It was just legit.

708
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000
But you know, we had all these little discussions. It's a new tactic or whatever.

709
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:36.000
And then once a war started, it was on because now we had to make sure we figured out our tactics and make them right.

710
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
And there is always, you know, people with different opinions.

711
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:52.000
I'll tell you what, I used to sit. I probably pulled so much leadership understanding from sitting in those meetings and not saying anything to see in two people dig in and getting a fight over.

712
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Should you do this or should you do that?

713
00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000
I could, that's why these, as I hear these things being talked about, I can, I can picture it.

714
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
You know, I can picture someone saying, there's no way I can understand a charge from all cavalry unit.

715
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000
It's impossible to think because you do think that. You know, you know what else this happens?

716
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
You ever, like, I'll, like, I'll train fighters.

717
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
And you think there's no way that this could ever happen.

718
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.000
And sure enough, it happens because it's a fight.

719
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Yeah. Anything can happen in a fight.

720
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Yeah. We're wild. The, you know, how like when someone does like a self defense demonstration.

721
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:45.000
It's like, sure, okay, someone's holding your neck here and you hit them to the rib cage and that'll bring their hands down here, right?

722
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:56.000
So it like their whole instruction or demonstration kind of relies upon the enemy to react or not withstand certain charges that you're throwing at them, you know?

723
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.000
And so, and then you compare it to like a real fighter, whatever, like everyone's all, yeah, like you'll get a guy in his,

724
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:14.000
liver and his hands will come all the way down here, recoil in this like way, whatever, but yeah, everyone's in a wild, but proud, partly ever really when you consider how many punches and kicks are thrown to the, to the ribs, you know, totally.

725
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
It's just like, proud. That's not going to happen. And here's what's even worse than that.

726
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:25.000
When I say to you, hey, you, when you grab me by the neck and I punch you in the ribs,

727
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
your grip is going to get loose for a second.

728
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:37.000
And then you say, well, it might not. And I go, okay, hold my neck and then I just punch you in the ribs.

729
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:47.000
And you know, because we're not in a fight, we're just kind of standing there and I catch you off guard and punch you with your ribs, you know, I give you a nice body shot.

730
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Yeah, your hands get a little loose, but you're not trying to kill me at that moment.

731
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000
You're, you weren't even ready for it. And so therefore I reinforce the idea.

732
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
It's like if the in this situation, if I said, okay, I'll tell you what mate, I'll tell you what, why don't you go down there and stand with your troops?

733
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
And I'm just going to charge it to you and see who can stand there. It's like, no, I'm going to stand there.

734
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Yeah, I remember my wife's brother one time. I don't know if he was just openly refuting the effectiveness of jujitsu or what, but he was like, he'd like basically like I just do pressure points on you.

735
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Oh, yeah, so.

736
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000
But not the kind of I'm going to hit you in a personal way.

737
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I'm going to put my finger on you and then give him a mock.

738
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Yeah, you know, all these things. And then so you kind of think like first off, like you kind of consider it for a second.

739
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:49.000
You know, like man, what if he does really put it, the pressure point on me or whatever, and I'm thinking, okay, all the times I've been training and competing or whatever, like what if someone put a pressure point on me, like during jujitsu?

740
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
I don't think I would ever, I don't think you'd even feel it in a competition. That's what I'm thinking, right?

741
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
I was like, even the most, I mean, really what's a pressure point?

742
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I want behind your ear, you know, your jaw and like these other he did one like by my neck.

743
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah, and I'm like, interesting. So I was like, okay.

744
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
And I realized like, yeah, Brad, you won't feel pressure points when you're for real fighting.

745
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So I was like, all right, even when you're just training like, Brad, you're not going to feel that.

746
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So I was like, I do it. And I just, I was like, okay, like, we're kind of fighting just in my mind.

747
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I wasn't getting fired up outwardly or nothing. And did it. I was like, oh, pressure point and Brad, all you have to do is be like, okay, this pressure point is dumb.

748
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And then when he puts it on, you don't feel it.

749
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But put it this way. Like if I'm just cruising next to you or something, even like you and I start like digging into the back of your ear, you're going to be like, oh, it's just going to make you move.

750
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Just because it's like, Brad, your mind's not like, oh, that thing right now.

751
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I had a guy. This was, this was, I might have been trained in GJ to like,

752
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
maybe six months.

753
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And I had to remember this term, traditional martial artists.

754
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, to you, man.

755
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Oh, I forgot about the, I thought about the abbreviation. So I had a traditional martial artist who is talking me about, well, you know, I pressure point this and you know, this is Bob, Bob, Bob.

756
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And of course, bro, you think I'm fired up for GJ to now.

757
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You're going to see me out fired up. I was for GJ to when I had been training for six months.

758
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I mean, I was ready to rock and roll at any time.

759
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And so this guy, who, he was a seal too. And, you know, you know, you know, you had like the whole thing going on, the whole kind of, you know, mystical sort of vibe, you know, talking about how well.

760
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And you know what I'm saying, I have no mystical vibe whatsoever.

761
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I'm like, let's fight.

762
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Yeah, that doesn't. Let's fight.

763
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And we actually, in this particular situation, we were, I had mats because as soon as I started training, I got mats. So I had mats, three feet outside of my office in the day.

764
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And where I was working at the time.

765
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So, you know, he starts talking to some like, hey, let's fight.

766
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Okay, so cool.

767
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And I think I actually started in the bottom on the bottom. And he tried to pressure point my neck, you know, my neck and I arm lock the shit out of him.

768
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You know, just, you know, he's in my guard. He's giving me, you can't give, you can't deliver anyone a more beautiful arm lock than holding your arm straight on their neck and trying to dig your thumb into their trachea or whatever whatever the pressure point is.

769
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Yeah.

770
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And of course, I was like, wow.

771
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
You know, I made like a face like it, like I cared and then just slapped the psycho arm lock on.

772
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And yeah, that was my, the end of my belief in pressure points.

773
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Yeah.

774
01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You know, there'd always be guys that would have some of the prisoner handling techniques would be what they call it. They called it pain compliance.

775
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Oh, yeah, you do this like under your nose, but you know, above your lip and above under your nose, just like, oh, you'll make you, but man, if you're at all fired up to use your term, you can just grit through that, you know, and it's different because if you have, because they used to use that if you want to choke someone you put your finger in a nose and you can lift their chin.

776
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Yeah.

777
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Try that to somebody that's angry.

778
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Yeah.

779
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:38.000
No, what you have to do is, and what's what's lame is all you have to do is actually just choke their face. You just put a rear naked choke on their face and then it'll open up and you'll crush their jaw and it's all nasty and it hurts. That's pain compliance.

780
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah.

781
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And so yeah, and when you kind of think about it because like you're right, like, okay, so doing that, the nose thing like when you want to lift your head.

782
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Did you ever learn that?

783
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Oh, yeah, I did that.

784
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Did you learn that in your jitz?

785
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Yeah.

786
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And it, it does work in jitz and training.

787
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Yeah.

788
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It can work in competition too, but you're, you make a good point when you try to do it to someone who's mad.

789
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah.

790
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Usually even in competition, people aren't mad.

791
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Yeah.

792
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It's like, it's like sport.

793
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Like it even feels like a sport, especially the more you train. Like in the beginning it kind of feels like a little fight because you're like, whatever, but in training, it'll work because you're not, you know, and it's mad.

794
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
It's like, oh, without that, like that's more pain than this whole role has presented.

795
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So like your head just kind of naturally does it, but if you're mad or if you're ready for it,

796
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
like if someone's like, oh, I know this guy always does this.

797
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And you don't let it affect you.

798
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It won't affect you.

799
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Here's what's really jacked up.

800
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It, you know, you and I both pretty much agree that it doesn't work if you're mad.

801
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yeah.

802
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
It wouldn't happen to you.

803
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
You give him your father.

804
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So it works even less.

805
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
You're just messing.

806
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Yeah.

807
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Yeah.

808
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I can see that little, little sequence for sure.

809
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Mm.

810
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Continuing forward.

811
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Vali Fire was obsolete as a skirmishing infantry or now limited to using it only as ranging techniques,

812
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
reconnaissance observation dispersion and above all marksman ship or now stressed.

813
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
So this is still right after the war.

814
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Roberts, the ever proponent of marksman ship eliminated the old bulls eye and replaced it with modern

815
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
smaller moving and disappearing head and shoulder targets that appeared at unknown ranges and

816
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
forced the men to judge distance for themselves.

817
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
By 1907, the qualification involved 180 shots over half of which were at range of between

818
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
300 and 600 yards.

819
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So that's awesome.

820
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
That's that's an incredible improvement to go from shooting bulls eyes.

821
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And you know, I always heard that this came in America after World War I that that's when they started

822
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
shooting.

823
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So man, save silhouette targets and moving targets, but here you go.

824
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
This is pre World War I.

825
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Had the British responded to increasing fire power by a recourse to harsher discipline and a ready

826
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
acceptance of higher losses as did some of their continental brethren, they would no doubt

827
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
of evolved a different set of principles.

828
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So.

829
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So the British instead of responding to increasing fire power by harsher discipline because you know what I could say as a leader is.

830
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Hey, when the machine gun shoots, we need to go and when it doesn't work, we go harder and it's still not going to work.

831
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
That's what some of the continental did.

832
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000
So as it was, they preferred to recast their system into a more intelligent less mechanical

833
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
surgery following Robert's dictates first proclaimed in November of 1900.

834
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:47.000
The British solution was a reasoned response to the realization in South Africa that officers could no longer be heard and dare not be conspicuous.

835
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
This is just such an important aspect.

836
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Every aspect of modern warfare emphasized the individual.

837
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Dispergent, which means spreading out independent fire, which means pit selecting your own targets, use of cover, which is sacred.

838
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Iner minute rushes, which means we're going to go whenever we feel like it's the right time to go, not just when everyone tells us to go, not just when we're ordered to go.

839
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And the sheer scale and intensity of the battle, the greater psychological isolation on the battlefield had to be overcome.

840
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So that the loss of five men and 25 advancing over 250 yards would hardly stop and advance while it was known that 50 out of 250 would.

841
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So this is just this this whole little paragraph is is so important to understand that the British had learned lessons and had actually come up with an effective way of fighting in a modern way.

842
01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:02.000
An indication the new British attitude was the substitution of infantry training for infantry drill in the 1902 manual, the combined training manual which applied to all ranks addressed this issue directly.

843
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Success in war.

844
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And here it is, success in war cannot be expected unless all ranks have been trained in peace to use their wits.

845
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:28.000
We want people to think. Generals in commanding officers are therefore not only to encourage their subordinates in doing so by affording them constant opportunities of acting on their own responsibility.

846
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
They will also check all practices.

847
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:42.92
So that means stop all practices which interfere with the free exercise of judgment and will break down by every means in their power, the paralyzing habit of

848
01:08:42.92 --> 01:08:50.92
an un-reasoning and mechanical adherence to the letter of orders and to retain when acting under service conditions.

849
01:08:50.92 --> 01:08:58.92
And you believe that's that's what we talk about all the time. That's what we talk about on time at Slamfront. That's what decentralized command is.

850
01:08:58.92 --> 01:09:02.92
Every leader is a thinking person. We want everybody to lead. That's what they're talking about.

851
01:09:02.92 --> 01:09:15.92
We want to set a culture where if you where we want you to think outside the box and we want to stop anything that prevents people from making decisions and showing initiative.

852
01:09:15.92 --> 01:09:27.92
Captains. So that's a pretty low ranking officer. We're not only granted more independence, but we're also forced to take a hand in the education of subalterns, a role traditionally managed by the kernel.

853
01:09:27.92 --> 01:09:39.92
So now we're looking at our our captains and saying, you better train these young lieutenant's get them up to speed with anticipate with the anticipated isolation of battlefield and just to reemphasize what they mean by isolation of the battlefield.

854
01:09:39.92 --> 01:09:47.92
We're all spread out. There's 300 people over, you know, a mile front. We are not close to each other. So you get psychological isolation.

855
01:09:47.92 --> 01:09:58.92
How are you going to act when you're alone? And you get the actual isolation of being separated from maybe from the other people that are with you. Maybe from your squad, but definitely from the senior leadership.

856
01:09:58.92 --> 01:10:13.92
With the anticipated isolation of battlefield and constantly intermingled lines, it seemed a necessity to develop informed and assured officers to prevent rearward drift.

857
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:24.92
The lower British companies with 120 men as compared to continental units twice their size seem to specially well suited to increased individual training now requires they may be units a little bit smaller.

858
01:10:24.92 --> 01:10:35.92
Key elements of new training for infantrymen included practice at various intervals of pacing accuracy of maintained direction use of cover and independent fire familiarization with intermixed units.

859
01:10:35.92 --> 01:10:52.92
And the development and acceptance of interchangeable command necessitated by casualties sustained among leaders. This is everything we used to run and trade it. Oh, we're going to put all your leaders down. You're going to use cover. You're going to use independent fire. You're going to mix up your units.

860
01:10:52.92 --> 01:11:16.92
The post-war developments entire thrust was toward a simplification of techniques that would allow for mastery by the lowest ranking soldier keeping things simple. The provisional infantry manual of 1902 went so far as to eliminate several traditional drill positions and all field bugle calls accept the charge.

861
01:11:16.92 --> 01:11:28.92
The reason you have a field bugle call is so that you can tell them massive people to do everything at the same time and they're getting rid of all those to say, hey, individual leader, you know,

862
01:11:28.92 --> 01:11:53.92
some more than leaders out there make things happen. The only one they keep is the charge. And why is that probably because that British bravado and courage is still a real thing. And because if you have one emergency situation, you want to at least be able to say, hey, look, we better freaking just charge hit the call.

863
01:11:53.92 --> 01:12:05.92
Physical and bay net drills were brought down to the squad level and the company replaced the battalion as the training tactical unit since it was regarded as the largest force commandable by an individual under battle conditions.

864
01:12:05.92 --> 01:12:13.92
So they used to try and direct 500 or 700 people by one man now they're down to a company of 120.

865
01:12:13.92 --> 01:12:25.92
The new manual stressed the many lessons of the war and was so recognized even at the time noted for example the tasks allotted infantry upon the occupation of a position.

866
01:12:25.92 --> 01:12:42.92
The forward placement of skirmishers with an eye to maximizing firepower camouflage utilization of rests determination of ranges and clearing of fire zones. So many tasks on so low level necessitated, necessitated a soldier who could think for himself.

867
01:12:42.92 --> 01:13:00.92
All those things still do those things. We get into a position we get to a perimeter machine gunners are checking out there for their getting in position there came a flashing themselves they're getting covered position. You got the the point man figure not where the extract will be everyone's doing this stuff decentralized.

868
01:13:00.92 --> 01:13:07.92
So many tasks on so low level that's what we're talking about.

869
01:13:07.92 --> 01:13:22.92
But the initiative. The impetus toward greater initiative by all ranks in the tactical sphere was one of relatively short duration as military emphasis began to shift toward continental warfare.

870
01:13:22.92 --> 01:13:31.92
So you had all these great changes taking place the lessons learned from the blue war and.

871
01:13:31.92 --> 01:13:41.92
They started to get influenced by. They started to get influenced by what what the continental armies were doing the French the Germans.

872
01:13:41.92 --> 01:13:45.92
The Russians, which was the old school stuff.

873
01:13:45.92 --> 01:13:56.92
The newer tactics were based on the belief that success in war depends on morale depends more on morale than on physical qualities.

874
01:13:56.92 --> 01:14:08.92
Same thing. So they're saying look it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. These little running around and skirmish lines and all that and taking cover. That's not what's important. What's important is the morale.

875
01:14:08.92 --> 01:14:25.92
The skill. This is what they thought skill. This is a quote skill cannot compensate for want of courage energy and determination. Boy is that a lie. No one wants to hear this. That's a lie.

876
01:14:25.92 --> 01:14:40.92
You think you're skill. That's like the tough guy right that rolls into the gym. This you have a courageous guy rolling it off the street. You know he's courageous. He's fired up. So he has energy. He's super determined. I'll take someone in here.

877
01:14:40.92 --> 01:14:44.92
Cool. Roll with Jeffy Glover over there.

878
01:14:44.92 --> 01:15:00.92
Yeah, because guys will say that too. I don't care how trained you are. I'm like ferocious. I used to be. I mean there was definitely a time when that was a much more prominent thought.

879
01:15:00.92 --> 01:15:14.92
Well, if it really went down. Yeah, I would just get nuts on you. Yeah, you know, and you're just looking at them going. I'll tell you what. Once you get nuts right now.

880
01:15:14.92 --> 01:15:31.92
Well, it's like, okay, you can kind of understand why someone who doesn't know any better would think that because remember back in the day when you're like a little kid and then guy can be bigger than you, but in Hawaii, I mean I'm sure they say they have an expression in Hawaii. They call it amp now. So if you just amp out on a guy.

881
01:15:31.92 --> 01:15:43.92
Yeah, you can you could take them for a couple of reasons. One, you're just going like you feel less pain and you're just going in whatever you have all this crazy energy or whatever. Well, you know what that is that's surprise violence of action.

882
01:15:43.92 --> 01:15:56.92
Yes, surprise violence of action. You're going to get nuts. Yeah, you're going to amp out on a dude. It's going to be surprise going to be violence of action. You're going to get the upper the tactical upper hand and now this dudes days and that's how you went. That is a factual thing.

883
01:15:56.92 --> 01:16:19.92
And yeah, and you can even get a factual thing with two untrained. I just realized, hey, I just said that's a factual thing. And it sounded like I was saying that that would work. It works if you're not if you're going in someone that's equally as untrained as your dumbasses exactly right. And that's the point. So you get a guy off the street, brother, that's usually how they are. They don't know. They have no idea what like.

884
01:16:19.92 --> 01:16:29.92
They think that if you get a choke on them that they did some sneak attack lucky thing or something like that's what it feels that they just don't know. So yeah, make sense that they think that you can kind of understand.

885
01:16:29.92 --> 01:16:34.92
That's where let's go again comes from. Yeah, a big time when someone's a go to old.

886
01:16:34.92 --> 01:16:43.92
I'll take that you get you stuff whatever. You know, it's not going to work on me. Cool. You choke them and then they get up and they go, well, let's go again.

887
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:55.92
You know, cool. Let's go again. Yeah, you know, those those Gracie and action videos. Oh, but those like that was how, how, how they and the guy was like, they'd be like, oh, let's go. Yeah, I just need to just go harder.

888
01:16:55.92 --> 01:16:59.92
Yeah, that's literally what they'd say. You know, it's like the same deal the same deal the same deal the same deal.

889
01:16:59.92 --> 01:17:01.92
Yeah, I've got to watch the same.

890
01:17:01.92 --> 01:17:08.92
But I can't, you know, can't do nothing. You know why, though, and I remembered I remembered this too, where.

891
01:17:08.92 --> 01:17:15.92
You know, before you know, juditsu and someone winds up in a good position, like, let's say you just get in a big scramble in a real fight.

892
01:17:15.92 --> 01:17:21.92
And you just wind up in this weird and they get you deep in some headlock or something like that, right?

893
01:17:21.92 --> 01:17:24.92
Because you were just scrambleing in whatever you wound up in a headlock.

894
01:17:24.92 --> 01:17:31.92
A lot of times, juditsu positions feel like randomly like landed on positions if you don't know juditsu.

895
01:17:31.92 --> 01:17:40.92
So someone has you like in the mount or on your back or whatever and you feel like real, like, kind of helpless. You're like, oh, this seems like we just sort of landed here, you know.

896
01:17:40.92 --> 01:17:44.92
So if I just go harder and maybe keep my eyes open a little bit better, whatever.

897
01:17:44.92 --> 01:17:45.92
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
01:17:45.92 --> 01:17:58.92
You know, so you're saying for the victim of juditsu, yeah, that person doesn't understand that the position that you end up in is a position that you know very you dictate deliberate.

899
01:17:58.92 --> 01:18:01.92
Yeah, I'm not a person out of the house now.

900
01:18:01.92 --> 01:18:04.92
Oh, yeah, which is known. Yes, exactly right.

901
01:18:04.92 --> 01:18:08.92
But yeah, if you don't know juditsu, it feels like, oh, he just sort of wound up there.

902
01:18:08.92 --> 01:18:12.92
Because we don't have like juditsu like this, even though the map and I talk about this, like, you know,

903
01:18:12.92 --> 01:18:15.92
when we're talking to people, don't have training it.

904
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:22.92
The map of juditsu side mount, my own guard, like, half guard, like all this stuff, I would have super clear when you know, you just super clear.

905
01:18:22.92 --> 01:18:27.92
You know, exactly where you are at at pretty much every moment of a juditsu situation,

906
01:18:27.92 --> 01:18:28.92
meaning or losing.

907
01:18:28.92 --> 01:18:37.92
But if you don't know juditsu, it all just seems like kind of like a whirlwind, like, yeah, somebody, oh, do you remember like, if your leg was over his leg or under his leg,

908
01:18:37.92 --> 01:18:40.92
you would have to be like, what are you talking about?

909
01:18:40.92 --> 01:18:45.92
But if you know juditsu, you'd be like, no, I remember one leg was over one leg was under, who was total half guard situation.

910
01:18:45.92 --> 01:18:47.92
Like, I don't, there's a lot of things that I don't remember.

911
01:18:47.92 --> 01:18:49.92
I do remember every single position for sure.

912
01:18:49.92 --> 01:18:56.92
And you know, it's cool when I would train young leaders and see a leaders and put them through dynamic.

913
01:18:56.92 --> 01:19:02.92
Dynamic situations where they had to make calls and make decisions and it's the exact same thing.

914
01:19:02.92 --> 01:19:05.92
You know, and I'd say, well, where were you getting shot at from?

915
01:19:05.92 --> 01:19:10.92
Was it from this building of this building and they would have no idea or, you know, where did you place your machine gunners?

916
01:19:10.92 --> 01:19:14.92
They would have no idea what happened or do you think you have all your people?

917
01:19:14.92 --> 01:19:16.92
And they would have no idea.

918
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:21.92
And then the better that they got the more training we put them through, the more they understood the positions,

919
01:19:21.92 --> 01:19:27.92
the more they would recollect what was happening, the more they could see what was actually happening as it was happening.

920
01:19:27.92 --> 01:19:30.92
And that's the way you need to train.

921
01:19:30.92 --> 01:19:39.92
The more time you spend training for these pressure situations, the more you're going to see the better control you're going to have.

922
01:19:39.92 --> 01:19:42.92
The better mind control you're going to have.

923
01:19:42.92 --> 01:19:44.92
Because that's a whole part of it.

924
01:19:44.92 --> 01:19:50.92
You know, that's one of the best reasons for juditsu being so good for self defense is

925
01:19:50.92 --> 01:19:59.92
you're used to getting, you're used to having somebody grab a hold of you and grind on your freaking head and grab hold of you.

926
01:19:59.92 --> 01:20:04.92
That's why also you need to spend some time boxing and doing moi tie.

927
01:20:04.92 --> 01:20:14.92
Because if you don't know what that little crack feels like, and it happens to you for the first time, you're going to get, you're going to get beat down.

928
01:20:14.92 --> 01:20:17.92
Yeah, especially in the face.

929
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:22.92
Oh yeah, get someone punch you in the nose or whatever. It's like, it's not nothing.

930
01:20:22.92 --> 01:20:24.92
Yeah, it's a jam you up for sure.

931
01:20:24.92 --> 01:20:25.92
Yeah.

932
01:20:25.92 --> 01:20:27.92
It's got to be careful.

933
01:20:27.92 --> 01:20:29.92
Continue on.

934
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:36.92
New criteria had to be drawn as to which qualities were desired in the infantry.

935
01:20:36.92 --> 01:20:41.92
By 1906 Ian Hamilton, and you got to read the book if you want to get all the background on Ian Hamilton,

936
01:20:41.92 --> 01:20:49.92
was unfavorably equating initiative and intelligence with smartness on the parade field,

937
01:20:49.92 --> 01:20:53.92
as a cause of rapidity and cohesion of movement all.

938
01:20:53.92 --> 01:21:01.92
And so what he's saying is hey, initiative and intelligence is kind of moving us away from cohesion,

939
01:21:01.92 --> 01:21:05.92
when we're on the drill field.

940
01:21:05.92 --> 01:21:15.92
Another guy Higgs believed that the war of masses necessitates mass tactics led to a tightening up of British formations

941
01:21:15.92 --> 01:21:22.92
to mean a density of one man per yard in an advancing line by 1911.

942
01:21:22.92 --> 01:21:24.92
So we can see that this is a nightmare.

943
01:21:24.92 --> 01:21:29.92
So this guy is saying this guy, hey, you're saying hey, mass,

944
01:21:29.92 --> 01:21:33.92
war of masses means mass tactics we need to function together.

945
01:21:33.92 --> 01:21:40.92
And that leads to if we're going to function together, we better be close together to the tune of one man per yard.

946
01:21:40.92 --> 01:21:42.92
That's a nightmare.

947
01:21:42.92 --> 01:21:52.92
This in turn was recognized as an overreaction to the South African extension since it seemed far easier to concentrate men on the battlefield than this bread the mountain.

948
01:21:52.92 --> 01:21:56.92
This is what we call modern day dispersion.

949
01:21:56.92 --> 01:21:57.92
You got to spread out.

950
01:21:57.92 --> 01:22:00.92
And I wrote about it in leadership strategy and tactics.

951
01:22:00.92 --> 01:22:04.92
Different reasons why you want to get close to someone else when you're when they're shooting going on.

952
01:22:04.92 --> 01:22:09.92
All kinds of reasons subconscious reasons actual tackle like I want to hear what you say.

953
01:22:09.92 --> 01:22:11.92
I'm a little bit nervous.

954
01:22:11.92 --> 01:22:12.92
I want to get close to you.

955
01:22:12.92 --> 01:22:14.92
We stick together and all those things.

956
01:22:14.92 --> 01:22:16.92
All of a sudden you look at look around you.

957
01:22:16.92 --> 01:22:18.92
You got five six seven eight guys right next to you.

958
01:22:18.92 --> 01:22:20.92
And that's not good.

959
01:22:20.92 --> 01:22:27.92
One grenade, one machine gun fire can can take you all out or at least several of you out.

960
01:22:27.92 --> 01:22:31.92
And it's already hard to fight it.

961
01:22:31.92 --> 01:22:37.92
But when you go into the battle situation, already tight grouped, it's going to be it.

962
01:22:37.92 --> 01:22:40.92
It's going to not work out well.

963
01:22:40.92 --> 01:22:47.92
The French and then the British began to consider frontal attacks.

964
01:22:47.92 --> 01:22:49.92
The most decisive of all.

965
01:22:49.92 --> 01:22:52.92
So you see what now this is again, this is like 1911.

966
01:22:52.92 --> 01:22:54.92
They're starting to regress.

967
01:22:54.92 --> 01:23:04.92
This regressive theory was given official sanction in the 1912 FSR, which feels service regulations.

968
01:23:04.92 --> 01:23:09.92
And marked the greatest split with the brewer or experience.

969
01:23:09.92 --> 01:23:13.92
Whereas the brewer wore led primarily to a modern approach to warfare,

970
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:17.92
downgrading battlefield cavalry and fostering initiative and firepower.

971
01:23:17.92 --> 01:23:19.92
Manchuria proved regressive.

972
01:23:19.92 --> 01:23:28.92
And so what's Manchuria is the the Russo Japanese war, which was the another big war that took place.

973
01:23:28.92 --> 01:23:32.92
And they were using the old school tactics.

974
01:23:32.92 --> 01:23:36.92
But they were also fighting old school against old school.

975
01:23:36.92 --> 01:23:44.92
And they were both playing by the rules.

976
01:23:44.92 --> 01:23:47.92
So if you and I decide to have a war of attrition,

977
01:23:47.92 --> 01:23:50.92
if you and I decide, hey, we're going to have a boxing match and the rules are.

978
01:23:50.92 --> 01:23:51.92
We can only punch.

979
01:23:51.92 --> 01:23:54.92
Then we stand there and punch each other in the head.

980
01:23:54.92 --> 01:23:58.92
And if you're bigger and stronger than me, then you can win.

981
01:23:58.92 --> 01:24:02.92
And so what and so then it looks like you're better than me, right?

982
01:24:02.92 --> 01:24:03.92
Hey, you're bigger and stronger than me.

983
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:05.92
And you will beat me.

984
01:24:05.92 --> 01:24:08.92
And we bring all the next challenger and you're bigger and stronger than him.

985
01:24:08.92 --> 01:24:09.92
And you beat him.

986
01:24:09.92 --> 01:24:11.92
And then we bring in a 300 pound guy.

987
01:24:11.92 --> 01:24:12.92
And he's bigger than you.

988
01:24:12.92 --> 01:24:14.92
And he beats you.

989
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:17.92
How did he beat you? He was bigger and stronger.

990
01:24:17.92 --> 01:24:20.92
But he used the same tactics, but he was just bigger and stronger.

991
01:24:20.92 --> 01:24:21.92
So what are we going to do?

992
01:24:21.92 --> 01:24:24.92
We're going to make our military, our groups bigger and stronger.

993
01:24:24.92 --> 01:24:30.92
What happens when you go out and throw a punch and someone does a double egg takedown.

994
01:24:30.92 --> 01:24:34.92
Put you on the ground, get side control, get mount and then choke you.

995
01:24:34.92 --> 01:24:36.92
No matter how big that person is.

996
01:24:36.92 --> 01:24:41.92
Simplicity and elasticity of movement were among the prime lessons of South Africa.

997
01:24:41.92 --> 01:24:47.92
Formalism was on its way out, but individual responsibility was still quite a way off.

998
01:24:47.92 --> 01:24:52.92
So this part here runs through a little bit of timeline that we've been tripping through.

999
01:24:52.92 --> 01:24:56.92
I've been kind of jumping around a little bit by 1904 both the scale and completly.

1000
01:24:56.92 --> 01:25:02.92
Going back to 1904 by 1904 both the scale and complexity of military exercises had increased.

1001
01:25:02.92 --> 01:25:09.92
For the first time the army and the navy cooperated in trial and vision and re-embarkation under fire.

1002
01:25:09.92 --> 01:25:12.92
The troops were now were by now scarcely visible.

1003
01:25:12.92 --> 01:25:13.92
So they were using camouflage.

1004
01:25:13.92 --> 01:25:16.92
They were hiding by virtue of improved technique and equipment.

1005
01:25:16.92 --> 01:25:22.92
No attack on entrenchments was considered successful at odds of less than six to one.

1006
01:25:22.92 --> 01:25:23.92
And there was no volley fire.

1007
01:25:23.92 --> 01:25:28.92
So that's 1904 by 1905 maneuver battalion and brigade training.

1008
01:25:28.92 --> 01:25:33.92
It become considerably more decentralized increasing responsibility of low agriculture.

1009
01:25:33.92 --> 01:25:37.92
So so 2005, our sorry, 1905 we're still moving in the right direction.

1010
01:25:37.92 --> 01:25:42.92
1906 exercises featured controversies over the effectiveness of machine guns.

1011
01:25:42.92 --> 01:25:45.92
So that was when we started.

1012
01:25:45.92 --> 01:25:53.92
This is like traditional martial arts and someone say, hey man, if you get punched in the face,

1013
01:25:53.92 --> 01:25:56.92
you'll give this reaction.

1014
01:25:56.92 --> 01:25:59.92
And someone saying, well, with machine guns, you'll have this reaction.

1015
01:25:59.92 --> 01:26:01.92
People are saying, well, I don't know about that.

1016
01:26:01.92 --> 01:26:05.92
So now they're having a little debate about what's going to work and what's not going to work.

1017
01:26:05.92 --> 01:26:11.92
1907 experience was marked by complaints from the territorial that despite expectations of their ability to perform on an

1018
01:26:11.92 --> 01:26:14.92
divisional level they never trained as such.

1019
01:26:14.92 --> 01:26:17.92
So now we're starting to see that the trainings fallen off.

1020
01:26:17.92 --> 01:26:20.92
Maybe a little bit, 1908, the problem.

1021
01:26:20.92 --> 01:26:25.92
Consistive mobilization and concentration of an entire army of four divisions, a tax cavalry and

1022
01:26:25.92 --> 01:26:27.92
salary services in the friendly area.

1023
01:26:27.92 --> 01:26:32.92
Senior roles of the roles of senior personnel, large formations and logistics are coming to force.

1024
01:26:32.92 --> 01:26:39.92
So now they're focused on the big movement, the big logistics in deference to private property,

1025
01:26:39.92 --> 01:26:42.92
which is where they were running these big exercises.

1026
01:26:42.92 --> 01:26:48.92
Tables were laid down to demonstrate positions so that they're just saying, hey, this is our position laid down some tape here

1027
01:26:48.92 --> 01:26:53.92
because they didn't want to dig in because it's private property.

1028
01:26:53.92 --> 01:27:00.92
Far more what have been achieved with actual digging, but that had to do a weight to the acquisition of larger government-owned training areas.

1029
01:27:00.92 --> 01:27:08.92
1909, the maneuvers marked a contrast to those of 1904 to 1906 as the infantry was adopting,

1030
01:27:08.92 --> 01:27:13.92
appreciably denser formations so they're going backwards.

1031
01:27:13.92 --> 01:27:22.92
Denser formation, less dispersion, greater commitment to reserves and more emphasis on the counterattack by 1910.

1032
01:27:22.92 --> 01:27:29.92
There could be little doubt that the British tactical practices had largely drifted from the military.

1033
01:27:29.92 --> 01:27:35.92
From those of all during the Bure War, to those of the more conservative French.

1034
01:27:35.92 --> 01:27:46.92
The memorandum on Army Training, 1910 emphasized a winning the preparatory action through strong advancecards to be followed by a commitment of a central reserve.

1035
01:27:46.92 --> 01:27:57.92
Central reserve, this is, oh, oh, no, commanders in the back and he's going to commit the central reserve under the direct control of the commander.

1036
01:27:57.92 --> 01:28:03.92
Who was to apply them at the decisive point as part of a prepared plan?

1037
01:28:03.92 --> 01:28:10.92
You see where this is going? We're doing Kata. We're doing Kata. This is what we're going to do.

1038
01:28:10.92 --> 01:28:14.92
This is the plan. Once you hit here, then you follow up with this. It's all prepared.

1039
01:28:14.92 --> 01:28:20.92
Yeah, that's another, it reminded me of like when I talk about that martial arts and demonstration.

1040
01:28:20.92 --> 01:28:23.92
When they demonstrate on actual victim, right?

1041
01:28:23.92 --> 01:28:27.92
Or it's like you're going to hit him here in the ribs, their hands or their hands and they buckle over.

1042
01:28:27.92 --> 01:28:31.92
You know, then you employ the knee, you know, here and whatever.

1043
01:28:31.92 --> 01:28:35.92
It's not only that they're predicting the other guys movement.

1044
01:28:35.92 --> 01:28:40.92
It's they're predicting it and then their next move is dependent on that very prediction.

1045
01:28:40.92 --> 01:28:41.92
Yes.

1046
01:28:41.92 --> 01:28:46.92
So when it like doesn't happen in real life, it's like man, I'll jam you up big time.

1047
01:28:46.92 --> 01:28:54.92
And this is actually the last section of this book. We're going to read the last thing. And this supports what you just said.

1048
01:28:54.92 --> 01:28:59.92
Concentrations were to be completed before and not during the battle.

1049
01:28:59.92 --> 01:29:08.92
Meaning we already know what we're going to do and we're not going to make adjustments, which is, which is the idea that you're talking about.

1050
01:29:08.92 --> 01:29:13.92
This idea that this is what we're going to do. This is the reaction we're going to have.

1051
01:29:13.92 --> 01:29:25.92
And the the Mike Tyson statement of no survived, no plan survives the first punch in the face, the common military, which is no plan survives the first enemy contact.

1052
01:29:25.92 --> 01:29:27.92
That idea is thrown away.

1053
01:29:27.92 --> 01:29:36.92
And we've gotten to a point through doing these fake, you know, drills where you start believing your own ideas.

1054
01:29:36.92 --> 01:29:47.92
They don't work. This is why when we started using Simunition and paintball in our seal training, we started changing the way we were doing business.

1055
01:29:47.92 --> 01:29:55.92
Because when we started that it was like 1992, 1993, they used it a little bit in the 80s, but on a broad level.

1056
01:29:55.92 --> 01:30:03.92
To actually go to, you know, to run drill after drill iteration after iteration, really didn't start until the 90s.

1057
01:30:03.92 --> 01:30:11.92
And then it really took hold after after the war started because then people were saying, well, wait a second.

1058
01:30:11.92 --> 01:30:18.92
This is more the drills that we did with paintball and with Simunition.

1059
01:30:18.92 --> 01:30:24.92
When with the war started, they were validated even more.

1060
01:30:24.92 --> 01:30:31.92
It wasn't the opposite. You might think, well, you know, once the war started, the real bullet start to finally,

1061
01:30:31.92 --> 01:30:36.92
the things got more validated.

1062
01:30:36.92 --> 01:30:47.92
And what's, what's horrible about reading this and seeing the regression is that we know where it leads.

1063
01:30:47.92 --> 01:30:51.92
We know that it leads to World War I. We know that it leads to trenches.

1064
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:57.92
We know that it leads to not not maneuver warfare, but to a Trishin warfare.

1065
01:30:57.92 --> 01:31:09.92
We know that it leads to 10 million, 10 million military deaths and 7 million civilian deaths.

1066
01:31:09.92 --> 01:31:13.92
That's, that's where all this goes.

1067
01:31:13.92 --> 01:31:18.92
Because we didn't learn from history.

1068
01:31:18.92 --> 01:31:24.92
We let arrogance get in the way.

1069
01:31:24.92 --> 01:31:30.92
And you know, like I was saying, with the two people deciding to fight, right? The Russo, the Russo Japanese war.

1070
01:31:30.92 --> 01:31:36.92
If you and I both, let's say have conservative minds and we're kind of stuck in the past.

1071
01:31:36.92 --> 01:31:38.92
We're both the stick in the mud.

1072
01:31:38.92 --> 01:31:41.92
That's, okay, right? That's what we're going to do.

1073
01:31:41.92 --> 01:31:45.92
You and I are going to stand there. We're going to go blow for blow.

1074
01:31:45.92 --> 01:31:49.92
We're going to box. That's what we're going to do.

1075
01:31:49.92 --> 01:31:55.92
And that's what the, that's what the brits were kind of looking around the world saying, oh, you see boxing does work.

1076
01:31:55.92 --> 01:31:59.92
Because look how the Russians fared here and look at how the Japanese fared here.

1077
01:31:59.92 --> 01:32:03.92
We see that boxing does see what happened over there.

1078
01:32:03.92 --> 01:32:09.92
But it doesn't mean that grappling doesn't work. It just means that you're not paying attention to it.

1079
01:32:09.92 --> 01:32:14.92
Means that they decided that they were going to box.

1080
01:32:14.92 --> 01:32:19.92
And if, if you decide you're going to box, guess what? You're going to get punched in the head a lot.

1081
01:32:19.92 --> 01:32:29.92
And when you come against a force that's equal to yours is going to be very, very hard to overcome them without taking massive damage.

1082
01:32:29.92 --> 01:32:34.92
And that is World War I.

1083
01:32:34.92 --> 01:32:38.92
And we need to make sure that we don't let that happen.

1084
01:32:38.92 --> 01:32:41.92
Test yourself.

1085
01:32:41.92 --> 01:32:46.92
Evolve.

1086
01:32:46.92 --> 01:32:50.92
In every aspect of your life, test yourself.

1087
01:32:50.92 --> 01:32:52.92
Evolve.

1088
01:32:52.92 --> 01:32:56.92
Make sure that you are making progress.

1089
01:32:56.92 --> 01:33:04.92
Make sure that you are continuing to learn and continue to progress.

1090
01:33:04.92 --> 01:33:08.92
And not progress.

1091
01:33:08.92 --> 01:33:11.92
And with that echo, turn on.

1092
01:33:11.92 --> 01:33:17.92
If we want to continue to learn, if we want to progress rather than regress.

1093
01:33:17.92 --> 01:33:20.92
What do you got for us?

1094
01:33:20.92 --> 01:33:21.92
Progress.

1095
01:33:21.92 --> 01:33:23.92
Always get better. Always progress.

1096
01:33:23.92 --> 01:33:24.92
Try to.

1097
01:33:24.92 --> 01:33:26.92
Step forward, not backward.

1098
01:33:26.92 --> 01:33:27.92
Staying the game.

1099
01:33:27.92 --> 01:33:28.92
Get in the game.

1100
01:33:28.92 --> 01:33:32.92
Staying the game.

1101
01:33:32.92 --> 01:33:33.92
Get in the game.

1102
01:33:33.92 --> 01:33:34.92
Staying the game.

1103
01:33:34.92 --> 01:33:35.92
That's it.

1104
01:33:35.92 --> 01:33:39.92
Anyway, we do that by working out.

1105
01:33:39.92 --> 01:33:40.92
We're working out.

1106
01:33:40.92 --> 01:33:43.92
We're doing jigs.

1107
01:33:43.92 --> 01:33:45.92
We are eating healthy.

1108
01:33:45.92 --> 01:33:46.92
Guess what?

1109
01:33:46.92 --> 01:33:50.92
You know how people sometimes go, hey, you know echo Charles, what did you learn?

1110
01:33:50.92 --> 01:33:54.92
What have you learned from jackel over the last five years doing a fash.

1111
01:33:54.92 --> 01:33:59.92
You know the first thing that I learned from you, what's that?

1112
01:33:59.92 --> 01:34:00.92
You want to know what it is?

1113
01:34:00.92 --> 01:34:03.92
You said exercise.

1114
01:34:03.92 --> 01:34:12.92
Is the singular thing that will impact the most aspects of your life.

1115
01:34:12.92 --> 01:34:14.92
And I never really thought of that before.

1116
01:34:14.92 --> 01:34:20.92
Maybe because I was too close to it and exercise is just kind of part of been part of my whole adult life.

1117
01:34:20.92 --> 01:34:23.92
And much of my youth was like focused around exercise.

1118
01:34:23.92 --> 01:34:26.92
But when you said that and you laid out, hey, it helps you here.

1119
01:34:26.92 --> 01:34:28.92
It helps you somewhere else.

1120
01:34:28.92 --> 01:34:29.92
I recognized.

1121
01:34:29.92 --> 01:34:32.92
Yes, this is a something I never really thought of.

1122
01:34:32.92 --> 01:34:35.92
I never thought of the impact because I because exercise was just part of my life.

1123
01:34:35.92 --> 01:34:38.92
I never thought of the positive impact that it had on my life.

1124
01:34:38.92 --> 01:34:48.92
But when you pointed out that exercise is the most universally complimentary thing that you can do for your life.

1125
01:34:48.92 --> 01:34:50.92
And look, there's people right now.

1126
01:34:50.92 --> 01:34:52.92
Oh, what kind of idiots would you say?

1127
01:34:52.92 --> 01:34:54.92
Well, you meet head saying that.

1128
01:34:54.92 --> 01:34:55.92
Yeah.

1129
01:34:55.92 --> 01:34:56.92
Which we take as a compliment.

1130
01:34:56.92 --> 01:34:58.92
But it meet head saying that, right?

1131
01:34:58.92 --> 01:35:01.92
You think exercise is going to, you know what?

1132
01:35:01.92 --> 01:35:03.92
It's going to exercise is going to.

1133
01:35:03.92 --> 01:35:04.92
It's going to.

1134
01:35:04.92 --> 01:35:07.92
So when you, when you kind of go, oh, you know, we want to work out.

1135
01:35:07.92 --> 01:35:12.92
Like, no, think about what I think about how that impacts every part of your life.

1136
01:35:12.92 --> 01:35:18.92
Get in the gym, start lifting, start training, start working out,

1137
01:35:18.92 --> 01:35:23.92
run, swim, do calisthenics, get after it, man.

1138
01:35:23.92 --> 01:35:25.92
It's going to make your whole life better.

1139
01:35:25.92 --> 01:35:26.92
Yeah.

1140
01:35:26.92 --> 01:35:28.92
That is true.

1141
01:35:28.92 --> 01:35:34.92
A little interlude. Yeah. No, it's the fully and man, it's like, okay.

1142
01:35:34.92 --> 01:35:38.92
So we're in quarantine 2020 right now.

1143
01:35:38.92 --> 01:35:40.92
So you can kind of fall into a thing.

1144
01:35:40.92 --> 01:35:43.92
I mean, if you're really in touch with like your feelings or whatever, like,

1145
01:35:43.92 --> 01:35:46.92
sometimes you feel kind of stale, like inside because you're not out.

1146
01:35:46.92 --> 01:35:50.92
You're not doing anything or, and not only you're not out doing anything,

1147
01:35:50.92 --> 01:35:53.92
you're not out doing anything for kind of extended periods of time.

1148
01:35:53.92 --> 01:35:57.92
You know, some, some people straight up haven't left their house months.

1149
01:35:57.92 --> 01:35:59.92
Haven't left the house.

1150
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:01.92
So that can like weigh on you.

1151
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:05.92
Of course, psychologically, but I think it's like physiologically too.

1152
01:36:05.92 --> 01:36:09.92
Like in your brain, like chemically, it, it got to have some kind of weird effect.

1153
01:36:09.92 --> 01:36:13.92
Definitely. I think that's scientifically proven that there's some kind of weird effect.

1154
01:36:13.92 --> 01:36:15.92
I think that's actually the literature that I read.

1155
01:36:15.92 --> 01:36:16.92
So I said that we were going to read it.

1156
01:36:16.92 --> 01:36:18.92
There were some kind of weird effect there.

1157
01:36:18.92 --> 01:36:18.92
Oh, good.

1158
01:36:18.92 --> 01:36:23.92
So obviously, I don't know the literature, but I know the feeling.

1159
01:36:23.92 --> 01:36:25.92
So like the other day, right, where I was like,

1160
01:36:25.92 --> 01:36:29.92
I'm like, you know, focusing, you know, doing some stuff on my computer for a long time.

1161
01:36:29.92 --> 01:36:31.92
And I felt like off. I didn't feel good.

1162
01:36:31.92 --> 01:36:35.92
And not to mention there's some negativity out there and there's didn't need streets.

1163
01:36:35.92 --> 01:36:35.92
Yeah.

1164
01:36:35.92 --> 01:36:36.92
Right now.

1165
01:36:36.92 --> 01:36:39.92
So man, I was feeling like off like man, I don't know, man.

1166
01:36:39.92 --> 01:36:41.92
This is all worth it.

1167
01:36:41.92 --> 01:36:43.92
I don't know what I really meant by thinking that,

1168
01:36:43.92 --> 01:36:46.92
but it was those types of feelings, you know?

1169
01:36:46.92 --> 01:36:50.92
I was like, man, I'm going to go outside and my home gym is outside.

1170
01:36:50.92 --> 01:36:52.92
It's a little covering there.

1171
01:36:52.92 --> 01:36:54.92
It's cool to nice, but it's outside nonetheless.

1172
01:36:54.92 --> 01:36:58.92
So I go outside and I feel like the sun, I'm like, okay, you know?

1173
01:36:58.92 --> 01:37:01.92
It's cool. Something to the sun, but I'm still kind of feeling it.

1174
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:05.92
But I did my first two sets, which are warm upsets, by the way.

1175
01:37:05.92 --> 01:37:12.92
And it was like my brain just like switched back on to like living mode.

1176
01:37:12.92 --> 01:37:14.92
And life is like here.

1177
01:37:14.92 --> 01:37:16.92
Now here's the problem with that.

1178
01:37:16.92 --> 01:37:22.92
The problem with that is that a lot of people don't make the transition

1179
01:37:22.92 --> 01:37:24.92
to the gym.

1180
01:37:24.92 --> 01:37:26.92
That's the hard ones.

1181
01:37:26.92 --> 01:37:27.92
They get there.

1182
01:37:27.92 --> 01:37:28.92
They know they're going to feel better.

1183
01:37:28.92 --> 01:37:32.92
And if they don't know they feel better, they should know that they're going to feel better.

1184
01:37:32.92 --> 01:37:33.92
But they don't.

1185
01:37:33.92 --> 01:37:35.92
You're at least have that thought in your mind.

1186
01:37:35.92 --> 01:37:37.92
You know, you kind of know.

1187
01:37:37.92 --> 01:37:39.92
Sometimes you're, yeah, I feel, I don't.

1188
01:37:39.92 --> 01:37:46.92
When you say you felt off, you kind of know that to feel on.

1189
01:37:46.92 --> 01:37:50.92
You got to go out there and just jack some steel.

1190
01:37:50.92 --> 01:37:52.92
It's true, right? Well, okay.

1191
01:37:52.92 --> 01:37:57.92
So when you do lift weights and you have to lift weights a certain like intensity or whatever.

1192
01:37:57.92 --> 01:37:58.92
And it's pretty low.

1193
01:37:58.92 --> 01:38:02.92
Especially if you're used to lifting weights, it's pretty low intensity that you have to pass that threshold.

1194
01:38:02.92 --> 01:38:05.92
That it'll trigger a biological physiological response.

1195
01:38:05.92 --> 01:38:06.92
That is positive.

1196
01:38:06.92 --> 01:38:07.92
Yeah.

1197
01:38:07.92 --> 01:38:08.92
Door fins and there's other things.

1198
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:09.92
Yeah.

1199
01:38:09.92 --> 01:38:14.92
But these are always here like when people the way some people, you know, whatever not everybody.

1200
01:38:14.92 --> 01:38:18.92
But some people the way they use indoor fins, almost like it's like this just throw away

1201
01:38:18.92 --> 01:38:24.92
and they turn like, no, friends, you just sort of feel better in this and like ambiguous sort of way.

1202
01:38:24.92 --> 01:38:25.92
But it's a real thing.

1203
01:38:25.92 --> 01:38:26.92
It's a real thing.

1204
01:38:26.92 --> 01:38:30.92
It's like makes you like, like just like depression is a real thing.

1205
01:38:30.92 --> 01:38:36.92
Like the opposite of depression, like that boost you get from working out is literally a real thing.

1206
01:38:36.92 --> 01:38:37.92
Oh, yeah.

1207
01:38:37.92 --> 01:38:44.92
So yeah, the critical and then consider that notion, that affects everything you do.

1208
01:38:44.92 --> 01:38:52.92
So if you if you're a stronger healthier and have the better attitude, I don't know one thing.

1209
01:38:52.92 --> 01:38:57.92
Well, I mean, maybe I could think of one, but right now I thought, I had I don't know one thing that that won't improve.

1210
01:38:57.92 --> 01:39:01.92
Like it's like tangibly, measurably improved totally good to go.

1211
01:39:01.92 --> 01:39:02.92
Oh, yeah.

1212
01:39:02.92 --> 01:39:03.92
So anyway, yes.

1213
01:39:03.92 --> 01:39:04.92
So we want to be working.

1214
01:39:04.92 --> 01:39:07.92
We want to be working 100% which means we're going to need some fuel.

1215
01:39:07.92 --> 01:39:10.92
We will need some for sure.

1216
01:39:10.92 --> 01:39:11.92
So we got to eat right.

1217
01:39:11.92 --> 01:39:15.92
But supplementation supplementation.

1218
01:39:15.92 --> 01:39:17.92
If you're into it and here's the thing.

1219
01:39:17.92 --> 01:39:19.92
This is all kinds of supplementation.

1220
01:39:19.92 --> 01:39:22.92
Here's in my opinion, most important type of supplementation.

1221
01:39:22.92 --> 01:39:28.92
Currently for me and I do, I am one of those people who like I do wish I was on this train.

1222
01:39:28.92 --> 01:39:30.92
Be like, oh, wow, look at him.

1223
01:39:30.92 --> 01:39:32.92
Before I ended up getting on it.

1224
01:39:32.92 --> 01:39:35.92
So this is a kind of fuel we like.

1225
01:39:35.92 --> 01:39:36.92
Joccal fuel.

1226
01:39:36.92 --> 01:39:38.92
Joccal fuel, right?

1227
01:39:38.92 --> 01:39:40.92
Anyway, joint warfare for your joints.

1228
01:39:40.92 --> 01:39:43.92
Crill oil for your joints and antioxidants in there.

1229
01:39:43.92 --> 01:39:44.92
General health.

1230
01:39:44.92 --> 01:39:45.92
This is good life.

1231
01:39:45.92 --> 01:39:47.92
This is going to help you.

1232
01:39:47.92 --> 01:39:48.92
For sure.

1233
01:39:48.92 --> 01:39:50.92
Omega 3s all day.

1234
01:39:50.92 --> 01:39:54.92
Also discipline and discipline go kind of the same thing.

1235
01:39:54.92 --> 01:39:55.92
Yeah, sure.

1236
01:39:55.92 --> 01:39:58.92
Yeah, we have some options there to kind of get you up on step,

1237
01:39:58.92 --> 01:40:03.92
whether it's the powder discipline go joccal bomber ice teeth.

1238
01:40:03.92 --> 01:40:04.92
Lemonade mix.

1239
01:40:04.92 --> 01:40:05.92
Every day.

1240
01:40:05.92 --> 01:40:06.92
Every day.

1241
01:40:06.92 --> 01:40:08.92
Um, did discipline go in a can.

1242
01:40:08.92 --> 01:40:10.92
You got that.

1243
01:40:10.92 --> 01:40:12.92
We just came out with the D.

1244
01:40:12.92 --> 01:40:13.92
Yeah.

1245
01:40:13.92 --> 01:40:15.92
We vitamin D.

1246
01:40:15.92 --> 01:40:16.92
Oh, you see this?

1247
01:40:16.92 --> 01:40:17.92
Yeah, that's not what the D.

1248
01:40:17.92 --> 01:40:18.92
That's where you're going to.

1249
01:40:18.92 --> 01:40:19.92
We're talking about sunshine.

1250
01:40:19.92 --> 01:40:20.92
Well, that's true.

1251
01:40:20.92 --> 01:40:21.92
That's a big D.

1252
01:40:21.92 --> 01:40:22.92
Yeah.

1253
01:40:22.92 --> 01:40:24.92
Sometimes we have to kind of fake that sunshine a little bit.

1254
01:40:24.92 --> 01:40:25.92
Get that vitamin D.

1255
01:40:25.92 --> 01:40:30.92
But one of the reasons I made the vitamin D is because I did my blood work.

1256
01:40:30.92 --> 01:40:31.92
Yeah.

1257
01:40:31.92 --> 01:40:35.92
The area I was lacking the vitamin D.

1258
01:40:35.92 --> 01:40:36.92
So guess what?

1259
01:40:36.92 --> 01:40:38.92
I know I'm not the only person.

1260
01:40:38.92 --> 01:40:40.92
I'm living a healthy lifestyle.

1261
01:40:40.92 --> 01:40:41.92
Yeah.

1262
01:40:41.92 --> 01:40:43.92
I'm living San Diego, sunny San Diego.

1263
01:40:43.92 --> 01:40:44.92
I surf.

1264
01:40:44.92 --> 01:40:45.92
I'm outside.

1265
01:40:45.92 --> 01:40:46.92
I shoot my bow outside.

1266
01:40:46.92 --> 01:40:47.92
I run outside.

1267
01:40:47.92 --> 01:40:48.92
No.

1268
01:40:48.92 --> 01:40:50.92
I'm in the sun and I still had.

1269
01:40:50.92 --> 01:40:51.92
So guess what?

1270
01:40:51.92 --> 01:40:53.92
I know there's other people that need to get on the D.

1271
01:40:53.92 --> 01:40:54.92
Yes.

1272
01:40:54.92 --> 01:40:55.92
The D train.

1273
01:40:55.92 --> 01:40:56.92
D train.

1274
01:40:56.92 --> 01:40:58.92
Get yourself some vitamin D.

1275
01:40:58.92 --> 01:40:59.92
This is good man.

1276
01:40:59.92 --> 01:41:00.92
Mulk.

1277
01:41:00.92 --> 01:41:02.92
But by the way, um,

1278
01:41:02.92 --> 01:41:04.92
one thing I know,

1279
01:41:04.92 --> 01:41:06.92
the situation is they put you in a certain scenario.

1280
01:41:06.92 --> 01:41:08.92
You want to take advantage of it.

1281
01:41:08.92 --> 01:41:12.92
How's the Mulk train recipes going in your house?

1282
01:41:12.92 --> 01:41:15.92
Because in my house, because both my daughters are home from college.

1283
01:41:15.92 --> 01:41:16.92
They're on the Mulk.

1284
01:41:16.92 --> 01:41:17.92
Hmm.

1285
01:41:17.92 --> 01:41:18.92
It's a lot of pain.

1286
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:19.92
Even.

1287
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:20.92
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:41:20.92 --> 01:41:22.92
They're making all kinds of stuff with Mulk.

1289
01:41:22.92 --> 01:41:23.92
Yeah.

1290
01:41:23.92 --> 01:41:25.92
The law of Mulk that put it in everything.

1291
01:41:25.92 --> 01:41:27.92
I never tried the wrong Mulk yet.

1292
01:41:27.92 --> 01:41:29.92
You, well, it doesn't taste like anything.

1293
01:41:29.92 --> 01:41:31.92
It just gives you protein.

1294
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:33.92
But you can put it in whatever you want.

1295
01:41:33.92 --> 01:41:34.92
It's like a cool little base.

1296
01:41:34.92 --> 01:41:35.92
Yeah.

1297
01:41:35.92 --> 01:41:35.92
Yeah.

1298
01:41:35.92 --> 01:41:36.92
Interesting.

1299
01:41:36.92 --> 01:41:38.92
Is that swinging with Mulk Munkruder and thing like this?

1300
01:41:38.92 --> 01:41:40.92
It's just plain plain.

1301
01:41:40.92 --> 01:41:43.92
But you can put it, you know, my, uh, middle daughter.

1302
01:41:43.92 --> 01:41:47.92
She likes to make smoothies with fruit.

1303
01:41:47.92 --> 01:41:49.92
You know, let's put the blueberries.

1304
01:41:49.92 --> 01:41:50.92
Oh, milk.

1305
01:41:50.92 --> 01:41:53.92
She's doing all kinds of radical things.

1306
01:41:53.92 --> 01:41:54.92
Oh, milk.

1307
01:41:54.92 --> 01:41:56.92
Just different kind of milk and stuff.

1308
01:41:56.92 --> 01:41:57.92
And so she's on that wrong M.

1309
01:41:57.92 --> 01:41:58.92
Wrong Mulk train.

1310
01:41:58.92 --> 01:41:59.92
Hmm.

1311
01:41:59.92 --> 01:42:00.92
My son on the other hand,

1312
01:42:00.92 --> 01:42:02.92
he told me that.

1313
01:42:02.92 --> 01:42:06.92
That the best flavor, which this was weird is the darkness.

1314
01:42:06.92 --> 01:42:07.92
Yes.

1315
01:42:07.92 --> 01:42:08.92
I understand.

1316
01:42:08.92 --> 01:42:09.92
That's what he's down with right now.

1317
01:42:09.92 --> 01:42:10.92
Yeah.

1318
01:42:10.92 --> 01:42:13.92
So he mixed one up this morning as I was on my way here.

1319
01:42:13.92 --> 01:42:15.92
And I took a little bit.

1320
01:42:15.92 --> 01:42:16.92
Peter.

1321
01:42:16.92 --> 01:42:17.92
Of course.

1322
01:42:17.92 --> 01:42:19.92
I don't know if it was like this.

1323
01:42:19.92 --> 01:42:20.92
What do you have?

1324
01:42:20.92 --> 01:42:22.92
You have your twin brother, Jade.

1325
01:42:22.92 --> 01:42:24.92
You got your little brother.

1326
01:42:24.92 --> 01:42:25.92
Hmm.

1327
01:42:25.92 --> 01:42:25.92
Can you not talk?

1328
01:42:25.92 --> 01:42:27.92
And then you have your sister.

1329
01:42:27.92 --> 01:42:28.92
I have a older sister.

1330
01:42:28.92 --> 01:42:29.92
Okay.

1331
01:42:29.92 --> 01:42:30.92
Did you guys fight?

1332
01:42:30.92 --> 01:42:34.92
And like want to stab each other when it came to food at all?

1333
01:42:34.92 --> 01:42:35.92
No.

1334
01:42:35.92 --> 01:42:36.92
Okay.

1335
01:42:36.92 --> 01:42:38.92
So that's what it was like in my family when I was growing up.

1336
01:42:38.92 --> 01:42:40.92
And if I can't, absolutely.

1337
01:42:40.92 --> 01:42:46.92
Everyone is ultra like dog wolf pack protective of their own food.

1338
01:42:46.92 --> 01:42:47.92
Good.

1339
01:42:47.92 --> 01:42:50.92
So, you know, I, my son was mixed up the darkness.

1340
01:42:50.92 --> 01:42:52.92
He put it down on the counter.

1341
01:42:52.92 --> 01:42:54.92
And he was going to turn around and kind of put the stuff away.

1342
01:42:54.92 --> 01:42:56.92
And he saw that I was in the vicinity.

1343
01:42:56.92 --> 01:42:58.92
And he immediately turned back around and grabbed.

1344
01:42:58.92 --> 01:43:01.92
He got into his own protective custody.

1345
01:43:01.92 --> 01:43:04.92
And I looked at him and said, give me some of that milk.

1346
01:43:04.92 --> 01:43:07.92
And he, you know, he kind of, he recognized it.

1347
01:43:07.92 --> 01:43:08.92
Debo style.

1348
01:43:08.92 --> 01:43:11.92
I had a debo his, his milk.

1349
01:43:11.92 --> 01:43:13.92
But I just had a little hitter.

1350
01:43:13.92 --> 01:43:16.92
And, and I kind of went into an agreement.

1351
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:17.92
Look, it's not my favorite.

1352
01:43:17.92 --> 01:43:18.92
But that's it.

1353
01:43:18.92 --> 01:43:19.92
It's good.

1354
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:20.92
Yeah, the darkness.

1355
01:43:20.92 --> 01:43:21.92
Oh, yeah.

1356
01:43:21.92 --> 01:43:22.92
The dark.

1357
01:43:22.92 --> 01:43:23.92
So, all right.

1358
01:43:23.92 --> 01:43:24.92
Anyways, get some milk.

1359
01:43:24.92 --> 01:43:25.92
Some strawberry milk.

1360
01:43:25.92 --> 01:43:26.92
Some mint milk.

1361
01:43:26.92 --> 01:43:27.92
Some some peanut butter.

1362
01:43:27.92 --> 01:43:29.92
Get some, get some D3.

1363
01:43:29.92 --> 01:43:32.92
You can get it all at the vitamin shop.

1364
01:43:32.92 --> 01:43:37.92
Or you can get it online at originmain.com.

1365
01:43:37.92 --> 01:43:38.92
You can also get geese there.

1366
01:43:38.92 --> 01:43:39.92
Do you just, let's face it.

1367
01:43:39.92 --> 01:43:40.92
Do you just, just coming back.

1368
01:43:40.92 --> 01:43:41.92
I think it's going to be like the economy.

1369
01:43:41.92 --> 01:43:43.92
It's going to come back even stronger.

1370
01:43:43.92 --> 01:43:44.92
Yes, very possible.

1371
01:43:44.92 --> 01:43:50.92
Actually, that seems to be the case even in theory.

1372
01:43:50.92 --> 01:43:53.92
Not to mention my practical practice.

1373
01:43:53.92 --> 01:43:55.92
But think about it.

1374
01:43:55.92 --> 01:43:56.92
Like, you know how like when you take some time off,

1375
01:43:56.92 --> 01:43:57.92
you want it one at one.

1376
01:43:57.92 --> 01:43:58.92
It's time to go back here.

1377
01:43:58.92 --> 01:43:59.92
Like, oh man, I can't wait to get back.

1378
01:43:59.92 --> 01:44:00.92
Right.

1379
01:44:00.92 --> 01:44:04.92
That's the they've been tricking stringing us along for a long time.

1380
01:44:04.92 --> 01:44:06.92
You know, us wanting to get back and stuff.

1381
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:07.92
So, yeah, it's going to be way more strong.

1382
01:44:07.92 --> 01:44:09.92
And that's not to mention the people who,

1383
01:44:09.92 --> 01:44:10.92
Hey, I'm going to start, I'm going to start.

1384
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:10.92
I'm going to start.

1385
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:10.92
I'm going to start.

1386
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:10.92
I'm going to start.

1387
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:11.92
Oh, there you go.

1388
01:44:11.92 --> 01:44:11.92
It's just going to start.

1389
01:44:11.92 --> 01:44:13.92
Oh, it's just going to start.

1390
01:44:13.92 --> 01:44:13.92
You did it.

1391
01:44:13.92 --> 01:44:16.92
Now they're really going to start pent up.

1392
01:44:16.92 --> 01:44:16.92
Pent up.

1393
01:44:16.92 --> 01:44:17.92
Pent up demand.

1394
01:44:17.92 --> 01:44:19.92
So, it's just going to come back strong.

1395
01:44:19.92 --> 01:44:21.92
These jeans boots.

1396
01:44:21.92 --> 01:44:23.92
T-shirts.

1397
01:44:23.92 --> 01:44:26.92
Whatever you need.

1398
01:44:26.92 --> 01:44:27.92
We're getting there.

1399
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:29.92
Made in America by the way.

1400
01:44:29.92 --> 01:44:30.92
Yeah, no big deal.

1401
01:44:30.92 --> 01:44:33.92
But every single thing I just said is 100% made in America.

1402
01:44:33.92 --> 01:44:35.92
There's nothing being imported.

1403
01:44:35.92 --> 01:44:36.92
There's no little parts.

1404
01:44:36.92 --> 01:44:38.92
And not just being, not just flying in a bunch of parts from all over the world.

1405
01:44:38.92 --> 01:44:39.92
And sewing them together.

1406
01:44:39.92 --> 01:44:42.92
No, they're growing it and sewing it.

1407
01:44:42.92 --> 01:44:44.92
Growing it and finding it.

1408
01:44:44.92 --> 01:44:45.92
We're just made.com.

1409
01:44:45.92 --> 01:44:46.92
Go check it out.

1410
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:48.92
And that does provide that.

1411
01:44:48.92 --> 01:44:49.92
Sao parć.

1412
01:44:49.92 --> 01:44:50.92
Yeah.

1413
01:44:50.92 --> 01:44:51.92
Bington.

1414
01:44:51.92 --> 01:44:52.92
Also.

1415
01:44:52.92 --> 01:44:53.92
More support.

1416
01:44:53.92 --> 01:45:00.92
More items for to represent and maintain yourself on the path.

1417
01:45:00.92 --> 01:45:05.92
You know sometimes the way you say that like in a lot of things that you say, especially

1418
01:45:05.92 --> 01:45:09.92
during this support section, you kind of wind it up.

1419
01:45:09.92 --> 01:45:13.92
And you kind of say it like you're going to have a new approach.

1420
01:45:13.92 --> 01:45:14.92
But there's not.

1421
01:45:14.92 --> 01:45:17.92
But that's the gift that keeps on giving for sure.

1422
01:45:17.92 --> 01:45:18.92
First time every time.

1423
01:45:18.92 --> 01:45:20.92
As we say in the industry.

1424
01:45:20.92 --> 01:45:26.92
So you know when you say there's clothes that you can represent.

1425
01:45:26.92 --> 01:45:28.92
And I'm thinking what is he going to say?

1426
01:45:28.92 --> 01:45:30.92
It sounds like he's thinking he's making a move.

1427
01:45:30.92 --> 01:45:31.92
He's going to try something new.

1428
01:45:31.92 --> 01:45:33.92
Represent while on the path.

1429
01:45:33.92 --> 01:45:34.92
And I'm okay.

1430
01:45:34.92 --> 01:45:35.92
I guess we're going with.

1431
01:45:35.92 --> 01:45:36.92
We're going to go with you.

1432
01:45:36.92 --> 01:45:37.92
All right.

1433
01:45:37.92 --> 01:45:38.92
So we're going to go with you.

1434
01:45:38.92 --> 01:45:40.92
If you need to represent while on the path.

1435
01:45:40.92 --> 01:45:41.92
Yes sir.

1436
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:42.92
Oh yeah.

1437
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:43.92
How can you do that?

1438
01:45:43.92 --> 01:45:45.92
Should we not represent while we're on the path?

1439
01:45:45.92 --> 01:45:46.92
Should definitely represent.

1440
01:45:46.92 --> 01:45:47.92
If you can represent.

1441
01:45:47.92 --> 01:45:48.92
That's what I think too.

1442
01:45:48.92 --> 01:45:49.92
I don't know.

1443
01:45:49.92 --> 01:45:50.92
I might be alone.

1444
01:45:50.92 --> 01:45:51.92
Yeah.

1445
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:52.92
But I'm probably not alone.

1446
01:45:52.92 --> 01:45:53.92
Why?

1447
01:45:53.92 --> 01:45:54.92
Because I see them.

1448
01:45:54.92 --> 01:45:55.92
I see the people.

1449
01:45:55.92 --> 01:45:57.92
You know, I see the.

Boom.

1482
01:46:48.92 --> 01:46:49.92

We got the thread.

1491
01:47:00.92 --> 01:47:04.92
Why is it taking so long for me to figure out the new name for the thread?

1492
01:47:04.92 --> 01:47:06.92
The reason is because the thread,

1493
01:47:06.92 --> 01:47:10.92
I like the name and now I want to get hit with a bolt of lightning for the new name.

1494
01:47:10.92 --> 01:47:12.92
It hasn't hit me yet.

1495
01:47:12.92 --> 01:47:15.92
Normally, I get bolt hit with bolts of lightning.

1496
01:47:15.92 --> 01:47:20.92
You know, I think that's a rare occasion that you get, I actually get hit on a fairly regular basis.

1497
01:47:20.92 --> 01:47:21.92
Wack.

You can share it with Fred.

1538
01:48:52.92 --> 01:48:55.92
You don't have to share him a two hour and 42 minute podcast.

1539
01:48:55.92 --> 01:48:57.92
You can just give him 12 minutes.

1540
01:48:57.92 --> 01:49:00.92
Maybe 17 minutes because echo doesn't like to edit things down.

1541
01:49:00.92 --> 01:49:03.92
Well, he's not going to make it into a three minute video.

1542
01:49:03.92 --> 01:49:08.92
But not without putting some damn star wars effects in it.

1543
01:49:08.92 --> 01:49:11.92
Sure.

1544
01:49:11.92 --> 01:49:13.92

Think of what that does to a little kid's life.

1580
01:50:32.92 --> 01:50:34.92
It changes their life.

1581
01:50:34.92 --> 01:50:36.92
Get a Mikey in the dragons.

1582
01:50:36.92 --> 01:50:39.92
Discipline goes freedom field manual.

1583
01:50:39.92 --> 01:50:42.92
Extreme ownership and that I caught a man leadership.

1584
01:50:42.92 --> 01:50:45.92

1589
01:51:01.92 --> 01:51:04.92

You can ask me questions.

1600
01:51:19.92 --> 01:51:21.92
You can ask the rest of the team questions.

1601
01:51:21.92 --> 01:51:24.92
It's not overloaded with people.

1602
01:51:24.92 --> 01:51:29.92
It's not like when I do an Instagram live where there's 87,000 questions coming in every second.

1603
01:51:29.92 --> 01:51:30.92
No, these are.

1604
01:51:30.92 --> 01:51:32.92
This is much more controlled.

1605
01:51:32.92 --> 01:51:36.92

1606

1626
01:52:32.92 --> 01:52:36.92
It is Mark Lee's mom, momily.

1627
01:52:36.92 --> 01:52:43.92
And she works all the time tirelessly to help service members, their families,

1628
01:52:43.92 --> 01:52:50.92
gold star families and military personnel that are deployed around the world.

1629
01:52:50.92 --> 01:52:54.92
You can go to that website to either donate or get involved.

1630
01:52:54.92 --> 01:53:02.92
And if you haven't heard enough of my monotonous monologues.

1631
01:53:02.92 --> 01:53:07.92
Or you need more of Ecos uncoupled orations.

1632
01:53:07.92 --> 01:53:12.92
Then you can find us both on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Facebook.

1633
01:53:12.92 --> 01:53:15.92
Echo is at Echo Charles.

1634
01:53:15.92 --> 01:53:23.92
And I am at jacquilin can thanks to our military men and women who signed on the dotted line.

1635
01:53:23.92 --> 01:53:29.92
And wrote a check with their lives in the service of our country.

1636
01:53:29.92 --> 01:53:39.92
And thanks to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service.

1637
01:53:39.92 --> 01:53:47.92
Who do the same right? Check with their lives for our safety here at home.

1638
01:53:47.92 --> 01:53:53.92
And everyone else out there make sure you build on your lessons.

1639
01:53:53.92 --> 01:53:56.92
Do not regress.

1640
01:53:56.92 --> 01:54:00.92
Check with the past question what you're doing.

1641
01:54:00.92 --> 01:54:03.92
Pressure test yourself and your methods.

1642
01:54:03.92 --> 01:54:06.92
Question your methods. Your old methods.

1643
01:54:06.92 --> 01:54:10.92
Make sure that you never get complacent.

1644
01:54:10.92 --> 01:54:16.92
And that you never allow your ego to overrule moving in the right direction.

1645
01:54:16.92 --> 01:54:20.92
It is easy to slip.

1646
01:54:20.92 --> 01:54:24.92
It's also easy to think that just because you're getting after it.

1647
01:54:24.92 --> 01:54:31.92
Just because you're training hard just because you're pushing yourself that you are doing it correctly.

1648
01:54:31.92 --> 01:54:43.92
Don't settle for that. Yes, get after it. But do so in the smartest possible way with humility and an open mind to learn.

1649
01:54:43.92 --> 01:54:45.92
Until next time.

1650
01:54:45.92 --> 01:54:47.92
This is echo and jacquil.

1651
01:54:47.92 --> 01:55:03.92
Out.
