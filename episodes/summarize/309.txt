and I have tears rolling down my face as I'm like reading the book I'm like you have your kid and me now if anybody knows me well, it's not a surprise like you know a emotional person you know one of my real close friends is one of my black people so Matt Waltman and he He just knows he's like bro, he's like I know when you're gonna get emotional If you listen to a podcast amount he's like yep, and then I'll get emotional just if you know me I don't like You don't get it like how do you keep on I'm like I love I literally love what I'm doing and it was like the same thing He's like wait just wait hold like hold like all and I'll study like JP activate. and I was like hey, you're following him now because I followed you You gave him back to them like I was like why was this that I'm like you look like he's being shadowed It starts like looking through all your stuff. She was dead serious like just like this is going to be horrible like body posture like like go down to the side like And so we go through this whole talk and that you know I said hey, I know one of you guys have to leave because it's actually your your teammate I said you guys have hit all the training objectives and so we can be done and this would be a good day training Or we can do one more run and we can do it to honor this gentleman that just got killed Because I'm telling you right now leadership is what's gonna solve every problem within this organization If we pulled the thread there was a leadership failure somewhere that allowed this complacency to creep in and this individual just got killed Because what this guy was doing he had done thousands of times over his career It was literally thousands of times and so we finished the run we finished today strong That was a Friday We had another week with them that we're supposed to do at the end of that month Two days later we get an email from the leaderships and hey, we'd like to talk to you guys about You know some stuff We're testing a bruiser all the other stuff doesn't matter Like this is who we are and this is what we're going to do and I like to also tie that in When I'm talking about Ramadi, you know when we talk about like hey, well you come back from the point when we talk about the cost and the burden and all that stuff I tried to make it very clear when I'm talking with individuals or large groups like We're all gonna have those dark times we're all gonna have those things from our past that could hold us back if we allow them to Like if they're not doing something right, make sure we're not being like, hey, you know, get on to them like we would team guys and Marines because team guys and Marines are very good at going back to that default of like, hey, you stupid. Yes, which is awesome and continuing to see success after success after success that's That's another great example of the many companies that we work with that go out there It take these principles implement them and dominate yeah, and it shows them one thing that I've written down I wanted to hit is the importance of like Like the diversity of people's like different people's ideas and backgrounds That's one thing I was talking like a company. We don't know what's causing it and then COVID hit and I hit up my Malika she was like, hey, you need to get these treatments for your TBIs and I'm like, okay, yeah, because you know Real bad tonight is and you know just Issues with just remembering stuff and headaches and stuff like that and Problems sleeping and she just been trying to get me in the treatment. Like you know, a basic student thing like it should have been like 20 push-ups or you know, make them like jump in the pool with your gear and come back out and go. well what's interesting about that is this this training program In situations like this which I've seen and you've seen when it goes Beyond Business application beyond the combat application obviously beyond the business application and it starts to get into people souls and sitting there listening to people debrief seeing grown men Seeing you know women apologizing for behavior that they know they they shouldn't have done and it was negatively impactful to their family like seeing those deeper those deeper changes That's always it's always amazing to see that this stuff applies and gets through gets through the people's souls it does I mean One of our larger field train exercise clients one of their upper executives You know the company I'm talking about everyone that we've been interacting with since 2018 run these FTXs all of those key leaders So we go we give the class and then we let them have fun like our hey shoot the guns like shoot them as fast as you can here's how you reload it we teach them how to put like a basic patrol and I always tell them like, hey guys these are not tactics these are the basics. All right, so those means where people were like this is my body like with all the checklights like That was you me I trade at me on the outside and sales of financial company It's been me for a long time, but not anymore that you're like They're like just it's incredible What those treatments do and actually to the point that One of our clients that I should on a front that's a part of Dave's LDAP program that we did an FTX for One of the guys is like, hey, what's a good charity that we can donate to and I told them America's mighty warriors This is what they're doing Well, one of these team members was so motivated because I told them what happened to me Other members like Cowell who's on our team a he went got those treatments He said it's been a game change night and day And we explained them like hey That problem is a leadership problem that is a leadership problem and you allow complacency to creep in People get offended at first They they get offended, but then we kind of changed the tone like let's pull the thread If we pull the thread enough it goes back to a leadership problem that allowed the complacency to creep in Because if we go to war with that complacency and we combat it and we do what we're supposed to do we mitigate all those things That's what we talk about being default aggressive as what we tell people hey default aggressive isn't and mindset for victory against another human being Now in combat yes, but we're not talking about that We're talking about being default aggressive to improve a relationship Work on your communication being default aggressive to mitigate safety risks and if you're Not allowing that complacency creep in because Of the leadership that you have because the culture culture is an ultimate form of decentralized command It is very disturbing It is very very disturbing and to that degree where they can wear someone and I'm totally dispaculating But they'll hear you say something that they didn't like like Somewhere else and then be like let me go to his Instagram And shadow it really makes me start to think about all the level of Interconnectivity between some of these elements out there and it's Because it is very strange now look could it be like Like, like, you're stoner, be like, Roger, you know, like, no handle that shit. I'm like that's a lot I was like I know a lot of bad ass females that run companies that are kicking ass I know a lot of bad ass female leaders in the military that did some phenomenal things I'm like don't. and he said hey One of our guys just got killed on a job site and it brought me back to when when Seth was like hey Mark just got killed It brought me right back to them and I remember sitting on the wall That's all I could think about is just like I didn't think I was dealing with this stuff anymore I don't have I could not Make something like that and sell it to people I couldn't yeah as far as I'm concerned I might as well be a drug dealer that that that is a drug dealer that is it that is a person that is Given freaking crystal meth and fedemine to people and and knowing that they're gonna get a dick to do it Knowing that you're hurting the health probably gonna kill them and you don't care because I'm making money I could not do that from a moral standpoint as a human couldn't do it zero chance and yet I kind of felt like I got to do something because otherwise people are out there They're visiting the meth dealers So I talked with Carlos and Cody like we give the intel pull them aside on my k we just keep an eye on her we need to like pour into her because she thinks it's going to be horrible like we need to make sure she gets the burden. I'm like what do you got like this is like this is the time for let's talk through it as if you're comfortable if you're comfortable with it she goes well for my past. and You got some smart guys you got some educated guys you got some uneducated guys you got some short guys some tall guys some slow guys some fast guys You got somebody that was born with a silver spoon in their mouth You got someone that was raised in the ghetto you got all these different people with all these different perspectives and That makes that platoon strong. But I also know that because I have that background perspective I do at times a peeled a larger base Then some of the other instructors because I can relate to all the different levels and I and I get that so I want to be when I'm like talking through this stuff I want to be I don't think I was just phenomenal like perfect leader in the military I was a Good team guy. So we want to make sure they know what we're talking about and Carlos is going to if somebody pops up the middle We have to shoot like what would you be able to shoot them and it's all every single time Like the client who has zero tactical training goes It's like hey, what was What was your biggest takeaway that you're gonna Leave this training with the implement back home and hers was you know same thing like I'm not gonna let my past define me This is this is what I've been looking for came to a monster pay for some guys to go to the monster with them Came back was like hey, we want to engage with you guys We did a we did a little trial FTX with with a bunch of their leaders and when they saw that FTX are like Okay, we need this I won't get into all the details of how they run their business and what they're doing so immediately I'm like there's something there like there's something deeper there obviously for her to be like she was not thrilled and just thought it was going to be bad. But this shitty chief that was in charge of us just completely, like even though Bobby was like kind of Raymy back and I was like, okay, yeah, And so I said all right, you know you guys kind of let me know I'll give you guys some time to kind of think about it and everyone's kind of like checking and they're talking and there's a few people crying I gotta be kidding me because I Think and I'd like to talk to more people about it, but I truly think Every human that reads that book will be able to relate to all of the characters I don't care what your background is 100% I don't care what your background is You are gonna find a relationship to every one of the characters Everyone like the store manager. But you're also a part of our tribe and it's I mean just to see like the coups bombs like To see companies that are that committed to see an individual like Matt that that's that committed to their companies growth and I was like watching it I was like hey, he's like what's up? And I'm just like freaking out like just like waiting because I was so hyped up I mean Like since I started talking, I just wanted all these points, but what you're just talking about goes along with, I remember when I was at trade at one of my chiefs told me, as an instructor, he's like, hey, we have to teach these guys how to think, not what to think, because the battlefield is very dynamic. Then I'm just like just doing different like photographs like the bellyback feet drills or they're just rolling. I think whatever I heard like a little rumor, whatever, I don't know who called me, but someone, you know, basically, it was like Colonel Troutman was getting the call. Hey, you guys made mistakes, but what are we gonna do going forward as a group if we're not sitting and debriefing and coming up with new standard operating procedures We're wasting our time If we were just a re-organ like all right, hey new leadership go new leadership go new leadership go There wouldn't there would not be that progression that we get if it wasn't for the debriefs and The debriefs are an awesome opportunity for you to do some soft reflection and that's what's powerful is And if you drink under age, I know you're not, I'm not condemning this, but if you're trying to go into the sealed teams and you're going to have a beer under age, like for me, that's not something that's like, oh, we can't trust that guy. so we get on a phone call with them and now I can we do another two to three weeks worth of training before the end of the year We're like I don't know if we can we might I think we might have a two week block open in December But December in your region is miserable They're like here's a deal so they took the reason why is because when the executives showed up on This location where this individual being killed It was a situation they'd never seen before because There was no pointing a fingers. and I didn't want to read it at night because I knew like when I would read at night I was I was not going to sleep because I was like no one more check one more one more and Today you know flying out here and I said well, hey, I'm glad that you came to that realization like these are one that that's the purpose of the train is for us to feel these things and realize like hey These tools work when we use them and all the other stuff that we have in our mind It a lot of it's all BS because it's that's not the reality But I can tell you they are extremely successful growing expanding dominating the market like dominating And one of the cool things that they do is every small to every company They acquire their their goals are acquiring small to medium companies in their industry with in 90 days They run an FTX legit and the reason why they do that is to show this new company that they acquired Their commitment to them to develop them as leaders to give them hope to give them like the tools to lead and be successful and He says there's no better program out there to implement the lessons and the principles that we need But also to tie in the culture. but sometimes that you that'll come on slowly where you don't notice the one that you're looking at I mean, I'm like I gotta feel like I gotta warm up just to live in my normal life, but you don't want that And you know, it's funny because I never said to like, I never said to lay for or to Seth like, hey, here's the four laws command and say that tone. You know how many people have told me that they've started jiu jitsu because of the podcast How many think I don't know how many you know how many people have come up to me and said hey I started jiu jitsu because the podcast and I really regret it Zero that number is zero if you are listening to the podcast if you're living human being go start trying to jiu To go start trying to jiu jitsu start right now. And when people feel it, then that's what that's when it comes home, like you were saying earlier, like when you make a mistake and you feel that mistake, when the cool thing about that TX program is I've been able to build a team. I remember watching how my guys took care of them without me even having to say anything and I. Shocker got a little emotional watching that because I was like my guys know they get it you know Yeah, one of the things I wrote down when you were first talking, and then you said it again is just as a reminder, when I was acting as a role player, my at the beginning of like them coming out there for that training, I would literally just have on a pair of gator-sung glasses, like not a mask, not the nails, because I wasn't really worried about being shot up too much. But yeah, they're not like, like, I mean, I had instructor that got in trouble because he would test the sharpness of the knives by cutting people's freaking palms. There's like a little kids You know, it started talking to him like, okay, you should check out my boss but we have it if we're talking about the You know how you feel things real time like when I have the greens I feel really good Really good Don't study sample size of one you know that's where it starts 100% for the for the factual is true fact also mook don't forget about mook you want to make it more protein about mook Yes, so we have the individual program the individual FTX program tour and individual like you just said can sign up and come to the training or guy like Denver And so if you team knows what they're supposed to be doing they don't cut the corners Therefore we keep our people safe and it enables like you're talking about in that scenario like hey, I'm not having junior leader step up That's that same week and you know it was you know, I've had a few members from that company go It was a complete godsend that we had your guys is training that week because that was a real It was a real hard thing for them to handle and I mean They've also explained to us like how their culture has changed. Still some of them just out in the field like, like, hey, what's going on right now? Then you've got to go find the key guy that the key guy's going to turn on your guns that key guy is a minimum wage employee that's only jobs to turn on your guns every single time we get that brief every company's like, oh, we got one of those guys. Yeah, it was, they were really trying to hard like, hey, it's now CQC and guys are like, okay. I'm like, hey, I know you did like some events for kids and he had laser tags. I'm comparing all these like I said, all these guys to mark and my key and Ryan and Cowley and like right.
