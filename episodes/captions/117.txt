[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 117 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
[00:00:08] And we're doing a Q&A tonight first one in a while.
[00:00:12] I've had a bunch of other guests and books and whatnot. So Q&A. Let's go.
[00:00:19] Cool. First question. Jockel from 115 podcast number 115 as a leader.
[00:00:26] How best to respond to someone like Corporal Meyer when he brings up good questions in a brief
[00:00:33] that need to be addressed without derailing the brief and calling your
[00:00:37] Competence slash authority into question.
[00:00:40] Okay. So what he's talking about is on podcast 115 with Dakota Meyer, which if you haven't
[00:00:47] listened to it, listen to it. It's long and it's very, I don't know. It's it's awesome.
[00:00:54] Anyways, it part of that podcast Dakota is getting told how they're going to conduct this
[00:01:01] operation and Dakota raises some point and says, what about this, what about that, and
[00:01:05] what about this other thing? And they don't listen to it. And so the question here is, if
[00:01:10] you're in charge, you're the leader and you get someone that brings up these questions
[00:01:15] during a brief during the plan that you need to be that need to be addressed. How do you do
[00:01:20] it? How do you handle that, probably? Okay. Well, first of all, and the most important part of this,
[00:01:26] is if you involve your team in the planning itself, you won't have these questions come up
[00:01:30] during the brief. They'll come up during the planning. So that's the ultimate and best way to
[00:01:36] solve this problem. You don't plan in a vacuum as the leader and then present the plan to the
[00:01:40] troops and expect that you're going to have the perfect plan. You did, it was only your brain
[00:01:45] working on it. What about everyone else's brain? What about everyone else's perspective? They have
[00:01:49] experience and they have knowledge that you don't have. So if you involve them in the planning,
[00:01:54] then they ask you those questions early and you figure out what the rights answers to those questions
[00:01:59] are. So that's how you solve the problem right there. Now, if it happens that for whatever reason
[00:02:06] you didn't have the opportunity to do that or you didn't do it well enough for whatever the case
[00:02:10] may be. And now you start getting questions on your plan while you're briefing. Well, first of all,
[00:02:17] if they ask you questions that you don't have answers to, then that could indicate that you're wrong
[00:02:24] actually. You could actually be wrong and not a lot of leaders like to feel that way, but you should
[00:02:31] actually be happy that someone on your team is pointing out something that is going to make the plan
[00:02:36] better as a whole. So there's that and it's really easy. If someone, if you're in a brief and someone
[00:02:43] brings up a point that you didn't think of and it makes sense, well, then you can implement that
[00:02:47] into the plan. Okay, so that now you might think that it hurts your authority. Right to say,
[00:02:57] hey, that's a good point, Echo. I didn't think of that. Let's implement. You might think or feel like
[00:03:02] that's going to make you look bad, but the opposite is actually true. If I go no Echo,
[00:03:06] hey, the plan's already completed. You weren't there for the planning, so just be quiet. That's the
[00:03:10] guy that no one respects. That's the guy that's not looking good as a leader. That's the person that's
[00:03:15] losing authority. So you don't look weak if you listen to members of the team, whether they're
[00:03:19] junior or senior. It also shows that you're incompetent if you because you miss the part, obviously
[00:03:28] the question is pertinent that they asked or I should say if the question is pertinent and it is a
[00:03:33] good point that it shows that you miss an important angle of the plan. So open your mind, open your
[00:03:42] put your ego in check and incorporate it in there. Now, this can also happen. If there's something
[00:03:48] that you know that you're right on, but something that you know that you're right on. If there's
[00:03:54] something like that and you and this, you know, maybe you get one particular individual that's
[00:04:00] keeps pushing back and keeps pushing back and you might have to in those cases say, you know what?
[00:04:06] Hey, Echo, let me talk to you after this brief is over and I'll explain to you exactly what we're doing
[00:04:11] it this way. So that way doesn't derail the brief because it might take a longer explanation than you
[00:04:16] want to, you know, for instance, the typical seal briefing was we try to keep it 50 minutes to an hour.
[00:04:22] So if you're got to spend eight minutes pulling up a different map and explaining some detail of
[00:04:28] the terrain to this guy that has a protest to what you're saying, you might say, hey, listen,
[00:04:32] when you get done with this brief, I'll pull you side. Let me show you the terrain map and you can
[00:04:35] see exactly why we're using this insertion router. Whatever the case may be. So you can do that if you have to
[00:04:43] and even then they might end up having a point that you didn't see and then you can say, okay,
[00:04:46] well, I didn't see that. Now we have to give everyone a quick, a rebreafing on some change in the
[00:04:52] plan. But again, none of this will happen if you bring your subordinates in and you let them
[00:04:59] first of all, let them do the planning. That's ideal. Let them come up with plan. I let echo come up with
[00:05:04] the plan. I'm not coming up with the plan. You go come up with the plan. I'm going to check with you and
[00:05:07] make sure that the plan is going in the right direction. Make sure it's not totally off track.
[00:05:12] And then you'll incorporate all these things and I'll have a better view of the plan. I can
[00:05:17] stand back and be the tactical genius as we talk about the book history of ownership. Like that's
[00:05:21] how you do it. So that's the answer. Well, at least is an answer. Yeah. Maybe other people have other
[00:05:31] answers. Seems to make sense to me. Yeah, that's that hard. It's hard, right? When you, when you,
[00:05:38] it's one of the things you always got to be conscious of when you have a plan or whatever. And
[00:05:44] someone for lack of better term poke souls in it. And be like, hey, what about this? What about this?
[00:05:49] And then you have those two elements that you got to keep in mind where it's like the fact that
[00:05:53] it's your plan and then the plan, you know, the effectiveness of your emotional attachment to the
[00:05:58] plan. Yeah. Yeah. You got to keep the emotional attachment to the plan. In Jack versus the
[00:06:03] actual effectiveness of the plan. Yeah. And people have a hard time doing that. And what's cool.
[00:06:07] What's cool is once you break away from that mindset, then it's really easy. Yeah. Just to be
[00:06:12] and everyone just kind of knows. Oh, yeah. Jockels. He's got an overmind. It wasn't to
[00:06:16] get as opposed to someone that has a closed mind, everyone goes, oh, you can't, you can't get anything
[00:06:21] by this guy. Yeah. You just, he's going to keep. He doesn't even help to point things out because
[00:06:25] he won't listen. And then guess what? You're using one brain versus 20 brains. And more important
[00:06:31] than the brain power, the perspective, the different perspective. Because the guys in the ground,
[00:06:35] the guys with the technical knowledge and the tactical knowledge, they're going to know things
[00:06:39] that you don't know. That's the way it is. You can't know everything that they know. And so if you
[00:06:46] shut down all those different perspectives, you're looking at something from one angle. You know.
[00:06:50] Do you see the whole complete picture when you only look at something from one angle? No, you don't
[00:06:54] know, sir. Use those other perspectives. You know, check self-correcting machine. Yeah.
[00:07:02] You can let go of the ego, the taking it personal. Well, personal. When I was in the seal
[00:07:07] teams, I called it the emotional attachment to the plan. Yeah. Because I see these people come up with
[00:07:10] plans and they would be so addicted to their own plan, only because it was their own plan. Not for
[00:07:15] any, not for any tactical strategic or operational reason whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. They just like
[00:07:19] the because they thought of it. Yeah. That's natural. Yeah. It's very natural. Yeah. And there's some
[00:07:24] element of benefit to that, right? Because if you're passionate about your plan and I'm passionate
[00:07:30] about my plan as long as we can eventually come to compromise, then we've put forth the best idea.
[00:07:36] Because I don't want you to not be passionate about your plan while you're planning it. I want you
[00:07:39] really to come up with the best plan that you really believe in. And it's interesting. You know,
[00:07:43] you talk about poking holes, right? Poking holes in the plan. And we all know that it's very
[00:07:48] easy to sit back and poke holes. Oh, yeah. And what I'm telling you to do as a leader is to absolutely
[00:07:54] do that. Not be a jerk. No, no, and I'm talking as a leader. If I, if I let you do the planning,
[00:08:00] then it's easy for me to sit back and poke holes in the plan, which is good. It's good because
[00:08:04] we're going to come up with, we're going to fill those holes. Once I poke the holes, we're going
[00:08:07] to fill them. They're going to know that they're taking care of. Also, as a leader from a,
[00:08:11] from a perspective point, you think, hey, Jockle really knows what's going on. He was able to
[00:08:16] find these holes in the plan. The real reason I was able to find him is just because I was not totally
[00:08:23] at at minuscule detail with the plan. You were, I was up at altitude relaxing looking around.
[00:08:31] Yeah, it's kind of, I don't want to say cheating. But you know, cheating. Yeah, it's cheating.
[00:08:36] You're cheating. It's that much easier. It's so much easier to sit back and do it.
[00:08:40] Yeah, and let things go that way. Like when you know when you watch a movie and you have like
[00:08:44] some critique, the movies outstanding and then you have some critique, I had to show that guy for
[00:08:49] that role or whatever. Meanwhile, the movies like ground breaking, whatever. You know, so it's easy
[00:08:54] to poke holes in the movie. Meanwhile, like, yeah, when it's done, you're all like poking holes
[00:09:00] up the little imperfections. Do that all the time. Make sense. They dig it. Is that happening with your
[00:09:05] videos? Is that what they're saying? Probably. In your way. Next question. We have been training
[00:09:16] due to for two months now. We started actually rolling a few weeks ago for my knees on the
[00:09:23] mat, like not starting from standing. I've trained for an executed multi, oh, I've trained for
[00:09:30] and executed multiple marathons, competed, completed a number of tough motors, trained hard and
[00:09:35] crossfit, hiked, biked, so I am. And nothing compares to the total mental and physical exhaustion.
[00:09:41] I feel after training due to it's how can I combat this? Time. Train more supplements. Just suck it up.
[00:09:51] When I get home, I'm so beat in the next morning. I wake up feeling like I was hit by a boss.
[00:09:55] I'm dying on that feeling. This might be exhaustion and still sucking at it. It's
[00:10:00] super fun. Okay. So that's the GG2. That's it. Okay. So there's a couple of things here. Yes, it's going
[00:10:08] to take some time. You're going to have to train. You train more. Your body will become condition to it.
[00:10:12] That's probably number one. Number two is, and this is so hard for people to do. Relax.
[00:10:20] It's really hard. It's really hard for people to do, especially when you first start out.
[00:10:24] I realize that the way you get to a point when you start to relax
[00:10:32] is when the capability of your technique surpasses the capability of your strength.
[00:10:40] So if I know that I can escape your
[00:10:45] choke attempt by holding your hand and pulling your thumb and pulling your arm off, and that's what I know.
[00:10:52] That's what I'm going to do. When I realize that I can use a technical escape of swimming my
[00:10:58] arm in and then placing my hips on the ground and then scooting away from your choke,
[00:11:02] I'll do that instead. But until we figure out the techniques, all we have is muscle. So
[00:11:10] the way you do is you just have to keep training and you can train. Can people actually when they
[00:11:17] try and relax do they actually get you tell me. So I always tell people like relax more. Like
[00:11:23] someone will say I just can't relax. I'll be like relax harder. But it's so hard for people to
[00:11:33] relax because people say oh when I relax I just get submitted. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So but if you
[00:11:38] relax you'll at least be aware of what's happening. And if you relax you can think about the
[00:11:44] technical movement that you're supposed to do to escape. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like just like how you
[00:11:54] sit though. If you don't know the move you're just going to go with what you know and it's going to
[00:12:00] be the spas in one way or another. If you if you guys on you it's like a never effective.
[00:12:07] Because I'll I'll go and say yes. Yes. Sometimes I have to spas and it Dean calls me out on that
[00:12:13] a lot. Well here's the thing. You're a good defense. You're just spashing. Well but you're spashing.
[00:12:17] There has a big more than a sprinkle of technique and that's the thing. If true. Like you
[00:12:23] and I told you this one time you know how like if you say yeah you're strong and that's kind of an
[00:12:26] insult in due to because like saying yeah you're strong but you don't have technique it's kind of like
[00:12:30] that's what you're in playing. But and I said this to you one time I was like you have like strength
[00:12:34] you're strong and you were like not defensive but you were like no I have technique or whatever and
[00:12:41] I was like yeah I know that I was like shoot that sounded bad. I mean you have technique. We
[00:12:46] already know that. You've been training for 25 million years and you have good technique but with
[00:12:51] that technique is like a lot of strength in there. Like when you um there's like stuff oh yeah
[00:12:57] when like if you if all be inside control on on top on you and you have this like first of your
[00:13:02] hands are in the correct spot just to be in with. That's to be and you can just kind of get your
[00:13:08] leg and real easy every single time. Like I can't stop it stop it and I'm not weak. I'm not weak
[00:13:14] but it's like the strength of that move is it. It's unstoppable and that's what I said it. I was like
[00:13:19] you're like strong when you do a technique it's like it's a strong technique. Yeah and I would say
[00:13:24] though there's a lot of oh I would say it's probably 70% technique and 30% strength. Which which may
[00:13:30] confirm what you're saying. That 30% strength is still more than if someone has 70% technique
[00:13:37] but they have only 10% strength to get back it up. Yeah fully and even saying it's you know
[00:13:44] 70% technique 30% strength. I mean that's going to vary from time from moment to moment or experience
[00:13:50] history. So if you're spashing even that's going to be a spectrum like how much strength
[00:13:55] do you use this technique kind of thing? That's because you can't spell for a long time. No
[00:13:58] you can use it. You can use it. You can use it. You can use it. Yeah. So when I say you're strong
[00:14:03] here's the thing the fact is you're strong regardless of your your technique or not you can live a lot
[00:14:07] of ways your big trigrab like I'll grab your wrist and when you break the grip of the wrist it's
[00:14:13] way more violent than the typical person. You're strong person. So there's no denying that I know it
[00:14:18] sounds like an insult to it but nonetheless back to the point. Yeah so if you if you have strength
[00:14:24] going in before you gain all that technique over the or the years just like how you said that's
[00:14:28] what you're going to use. So the key is here I think is to consciously and it's not easy.
[00:14:37] Consciously focus on the technique. Consciously like remember okay where am I? I mean half guard right
[00:14:41] now because you know all like in the beginning when you first learn the the positions you're like
[00:14:45] half guard is real clear guard is real clear. When you start rolling around your halfway upside down
[00:14:50] maybe your twisting maybe your arms in the wrong spot across your body so like you kind of don't
[00:14:55] remember oh wait I'm in half guard right now or I'm upside down but I'm in you know I'm on his back
[00:15:01] still or whatever so you don't it doesn't just stick in your mind what position you're in but if you can
[00:15:07] do that then it starts getting getting routine so now after that you can figure out okay my
[00:15:12] safe here because that's why you spas that's why you you can't relax because you don't know if you're
[00:15:16] safe or not so you're just trying to move and get out of there or you know get that's a mission
[00:15:21] hurry up before he does something you know where the supplies to life this applies to life
[00:15:26] in when you're interacting with other people and you start to let's say you and I are having
[00:15:33] a disagreement about something right and you start getting the upper hand on me
[00:15:40] and instead of me trying to use a technique to get out all I do is go let's do Brideco you're
[00:15:46] done or something right I just are interrupting you're cutting off raising my voice I'm actually losing
[00:15:51] now and I don't you know but I'm relying on brute force as opposed to technique now it could
[00:16:00] be also like we talked about earlier could be that I'm wrong and if instead of admitting that I'm wrong
[00:16:06] or or taking like you're saying relax and looking at the technique and saying you know what echo
[00:16:11] has a point here that I can't debate against he's right and I'm wrong I need to admit that same
[00:16:17] thing if you came up with an idea for the plan and your idea was better than mine or you had
[00:16:21] a point that I needed to bring into the plan unless I unless I can relax and actually pay attention
[00:16:28] then I'm not going to be able to do that so that's how well that's one of the many ways when I
[00:16:33] always talk about GJ2 applying to life this is another example of where hey if the argument starts
[00:16:39] to escalate and you're using brute force to get out of it you're not winning just like you're not
[00:16:44] winning in GJ2 it's you're gonna gas out you're gonna lose yeah don't use brute force yeah
[00:16:51] yeah not even 30% well maybe sometimes 30% okay the other thing is the other thing that's hard
[00:16:57] and it's well it's it's attached to what you're saying don't have death matches every time
[00:17:04] yeah right don't it like you find a partner and just be like okay let's try and make sure that
[00:17:09] we're not using so much strength I can roll with you or with Dean or with Andy or whoever
[00:17:17] for a long time and it's you know we're sweating or tired but we're not using all this strength
[00:17:24] we're not walking off the mat with a with with a burned-out muscles yeah it's a different it's more
[00:17:29] of a cardio I would say then then a strength thing when you get to a higher level because you're
[00:17:35] you're just movement it's movement that's happening you know when to you know when someone's
[00:17:39] gonna accomplish something and if you're gonna fight it with muscle you're gonna you're gonna
[00:17:44] end up losing yeah and it goes back to the time thing where how does that seem to be
[00:17:49] is it more time and the answer is yeah it's more time because like you you learn that and again like
[00:17:54] where knowing where to be and where not to be where you're safe and where you're not safe
[00:17:59] or in your jutsu is a big deal so you know how like okay let's say and I know this with you because
[00:18:04] let's say if I pass your guard sorry you let me pass your guard I don't know you don't
[00:18:09] spaz and like you know like an tournament where the guys like really trying hard not to let you
[00:18:14] settle in guard and so that's a different scenario of course but you never do that you it's like
[00:18:19] you get to a point pass your guard once you kind of get there you just you settle and you're
[00:18:23] kind of relaxing because you it seems like anyway that you know you're not in danger for a submission
[00:18:30] so that's kind of really where the focus is it's it's not the fact that ooh he passed my guard
[00:18:34] oh no that's terrible it's not that it's okay now what technique do you need to implement to keep
[00:18:40] myself safe and the more you know about the jutsu the more you realize it doesn't take a huge amount
[00:18:44] of energy to to implement that technique it's usually just like an arm position make sure his
[00:18:49] hip is like over there and not over here and that's kind of that's it that's pretty much it
[00:18:53] but if you don't know that you're like oh man you're using your whole body to get out of there
[00:18:57] kind of thing and that's that's where you're leaving no reserves in a military perspective
[00:19:03] in a military you're always supposed to keep your reserves as long as you can oh yeah you're just
[00:19:06] you then all reserves trying to spaz out and get out of a dominant position you're also attacking
[00:19:11] a dominant position when you're spazzing to try and get out you're you're just going crazy trying
[00:19:16] to get out of this confirmed position I mean across the side or the mount those are positions that are
[00:19:21] really sure there's a transitional time when you should definitely spaz to try and get out once that's
[00:19:26] surpassed well now you're just you're just expanding energy yeah so defense learning check your diet
[00:19:32] too if you're like really sore and everything make sure you're getting enough protein make sure
[00:19:36] you're getting enough fat make sure you're getting maybe get some uh get some superkrill or some
[00:19:40] or some joint warfare or both because you your body needs it so just other things to try and
[00:19:48] put off that soreness in the pain yeah all right yeah well that twisting yeah there's definitely
[00:19:55] you know well yeah it's hard under joints yeah yeah hard yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:20:01] yeah they get a workout you know they get a workout that you won't be getting doing other stuff
[00:20:05] unless yeah you know construction or something you know something like that same thing you're
[00:20:08] gonna get joint stuff that's how but yeah keep it supposed to be fun the death matches though
[00:20:15] death matches yeah white belt death matches yeah probably um i would estimate 40% of all
[00:20:23] injuries in Gjitsu come from white belt death matches is that you think that's a good number
[00:20:27] yeah if not higher yeah full on yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:20:33] check okay next question you talk about you talk about empathy and perspective
[00:20:41] and building relationships as a leader but i look at leader a leader like Steve Jobs
[00:20:46] who's known for his hostile attitude toward people isn't that being de-falte aggressive like you
[00:20:51] talk about if i'm more naturally that type of leader should i go with it if it worked for Steve
[00:20:57] Jobs shouldn't it work for me so that's a good question and i haven't actually read the book
[00:21:06] about Steve Jobs and i think there's probably more than one but there's one that's real popular
[00:21:10] real thick and someone gave it to me and i have it and i will someday but i haven't read it yet
[00:21:14] and i've heard it's really good and all that and i that being said i've i've heard the same
[00:21:20] things about you know Steve Jobs at leadership style he was real tyrannical and i pulled a
[00:21:26] couple things here just from well here we go in his book about jobs time at next and returned
[00:21:34] apple the second coming of Steve Jobs Allen dogeman described jobs rough treatment of his
[00:21:42] underlings he would praise is the quote he would praise and inspire them often in very creative ways
[00:21:48] but he would also resort to intimidating goding berating belittle belittling and even accumulating them so
[00:21:57] and there's another article by Ronald regio who's a PhD in psychology and the article came from
[00:22:05] psychology today and it says he was obsessively controlling and given to fits of rage throwing
[00:22:13] tantrums and yelling at employees and board members he could tear down someone's ideas or the
[00:22:18] person himself in a public display some of said he took credit for others ideas and his confidence
[00:22:26] led to a sort of over the top arrogance so the guys kind of tyrannical one time when they were
[00:22:36] putting together the mobile me application and it wasn't working well and jobs told the team that
[00:22:41] was putting it together you when it wasn't working you've tarnished apples reputation you should
[00:22:46] hate each other for having let each other down so okay so first of all let's look at the fact
[00:22:55] and you've heard me say this before that people's strengths are their weaknesses and their
[00:22:59] weaknesses can be their strengths so in Steve Jobs case obviously some of this stuff some of his
[00:23:06] weaknesses that we're talking about here were also strengths because he was totally beyond driven
[00:23:10] right he was completely obsessed with doing good and all that and and he pressed toward his vision
[00:23:17] extremely hard he was relentless in trying to make things happen and again those are very positive
[00:23:23] characteristics if you got someone that's really driven and they're driven to the point of almost
[00:23:27] being obsessed and you you take that and those are kind of good characteristics but when they go to
[00:23:33] far this is why it's dichotomous the balance of leadership right when when you go to far you become a
[00:23:38] tyrannical leader which is not good it's not good for a team and it's and it's an a team that is
[00:23:43] subjected to that kind of attitude will not perform as well as a unified team period period
[00:23:53] so the guy was clearly hostile and at the same time clearly he was one of the most successful
[00:24:02] business leaders in history right so would you look at him and say okay well maybe I should be that
[00:24:08] way maybe I should be a tyrannical leader and I would say to that no you do not get to do that and here's why
[00:24:16] let's look at some other characteristics that Steve Jobs had first of all he was perhaps the
[00:24:24] foremost technological visionary in the history of the world right I mean he had a vision of technology
[00:24:35] that very few people in the history in the world of had and I will go a little bit more narrow I
[00:24:40] think he understood things on another level when it came to technology that the part of how
[00:24:47] human beings would interact with technology that's the part that I think he really had
[00:24:52] just incredible vision for he realized like oh these people who want to compete in their house
[00:24:58] and they want to reflect the way they live and they're going to want music in their pocket they're
[00:25:03] going to want all of their music in their pocket and they're going to want a phone that can do
[00:25:07] you know he had this vision of how people would interact with technology that I don't think too many
[00:25:12] people had so so that's number one number two he had a phenomenal feel for design
[00:25:20] right for design and how to merge form and function together in in an aesthetically pleasing
[00:25:30] and and oftentimes stunning way right if you look at the design and that's on common especially
[00:25:35] for someone to have that feel for design and still have a massively technical background right
[00:25:42] so so that again we're we're we're making a person that's like 1% of 1% of 1% already
[00:25:48] on top of that he got into business his business at the right time in the right place he had the right
[00:25:55] background on top of that the guy could speak well the guy was very articulate right he was very
[00:26:04] articulate with his vision if you if you watch his keynote speeches that he would give at the
[00:26:10] whatever it is when they have the Apple convention what's that thing called the Apple Command
[00:26:14] they have that thing we get up on stage and he talk about stuff and he would articulate that
[00:26:20] and he would do it with real clarity and he was very convincing and he was very captivating
[00:26:25] and people were you know they'd say Apple's a cult they'd follow that guy so he had
[00:26:32] all those skills those world class skills and I'm not using that term lately I'm talking
[00:26:37] world class skills and then they're all those world class skills are combined together into
[00:26:44] one package one human being and there you got you got Steve Jobs so he's got all those advantages
[00:26:50] and then on top of that he's had some luck along the way right yet some luck in his timing
[00:26:55] and just upbringing and and the exposures that he got and being exposed to computer programming
[00:27:02] and those things back in the day was rare and he got lucky and having that unfold from so he had
[00:27:09] all these things going for him that helped propel him and his company to the top so now if you're
[00:27:18] thinking maybe you should use his leadership style the the the questions that you should ask yourself
[00:27:25] is are you all one in a billion technological visionary or visionary of any kind
[00:27:31] the answer that is likely no and if you think it's yes maybe you should check your ego a little bit
[00:27:39] then you have to ask yourself do you have an eye for design on artistic eye for design like
[00:27:46] like divinci or Michelangelo if you have that you you you probably don't if you think you have
[00:27:53] that maybe you should check his ego again are you a gifted speaker and storyteller and can you convey
[00:28:00] your vision with total clarity to big giant groups broad groups of people and if you think you can
[00:28:09] do that again you should check your ego can you count on luck or do you want to count on luck
[00:28:17] to to close the gaps in some of those other areas so if you could do all those things if you
[00:28:23] answered yes 100% to all those questions and okay maybe you can get away with being a kind of
[00:28:31] leader that Steve Jobs was but if you're a normal person if you're a normal human being then
[00:28:38] maybe you should try and be a good leader and maybe you should be a leader that build relationships
[00:28:43] and forms cohesive teams and coalitions that help you drive your mission forward despite the
[00:28:49] ups and downs of whatever business you're in so that's it Steve Jobs had a lot of other things
[00:29:00] that made him successful and leadership and and he I'm going to eventually read the book but
[00:29:08] he clearly had some people around him that that utilized that skill the skills that he did
[00:29:17] had and have and move help moving forward right other people at the company other people early in Apple
[00:29:24] saw that hey you know what this guy he might be a little bit hard to deal with but he's got some
[00:29:27] things that we won't find anywhere else so let's prop them up and let's move forward
[00:29:32] and that's that's the way it works yeah I think they call that survivor ship bias where you're like
[00:29:39] you see oh you see a successful guy you know yeah yeah he did it that way so let's do it that way
[00:29:44] but yeah you kind of don't see all the other factors or whatever almost like you if you really
[00:29:50] think about it if Steve Jobs were to be like in these tyrannical ways or whatever if you were to be
[00:29:54] less like that maybe there would be more because they were more similar but he was so strong in
[00:29:58] these other areas that it kind of like mitigated the effects you know there's there's businesses
[00:30:03] that are successful because there are successful business model and they have really bad leadership
[00:30:08] yeah and even that kind of mess there's still kind of thing that yeah even the bad leadership
[00:30:11] doesn't if it's the the model is so good yeah which is a little bit contrary because you know
[00:30:17] I always say leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield but in the business world if you
[00:30:21] have a phenomenal idea then you can you can be successful on that idea alone now that is that is
[00:30:27] a unicorn that is one of those rare things where you have something that's that incredibly
[00:30:32] different and stands out from the crowd so much that it's going to be successful no matter what
[00:30:38] you know when the when the early gyms MMA type gyms if you had one you were successful
[00:30:45] didn't matter what kind of leader you were because you had you had it and now there's competition
[00:30:50] if you're not if you're not good leadership and you're not putting forth a good product amongst
[00:30:54] all the competitors you're going to have problems yeah you're going to have problems with it yeah
[00:30:57] and the more I kind of listen to you in life the more I realize that even then the like
[00:31:04] it's almost like you have to have a minimum level of leadership like you don't be
[00:31:09] have to be perfect if you have one of these situations where the product of the business
[00:31:13] is so good but still even your leadership can mess that oh yeah you can absolutely because
[00:31:18] you shouldn't yeah like here in a situation where like no no no one wants to work for you now
[00:31:22] what oh yeah good nice MMA gym you don't have any you got to work there yeah you know the whole
[00:31:27] time and you can't you know so it's going to kind of fall apart after a while so maybe like
[00:31:31] in the beginning it would be good but it'll fall apart because of your last year for sure and you
[00:31:36] can see that I mean who's the guy that just got removed from Uber I'd have to go into the
[00:31:42] I'd have to really drill down on it but the CEO of Uber got removed and you know the business
[00:31:50] models awesome yeah and they still remove the CEO why because there's there's issues there
[00:31:57] yeah and so well it's a great business model but we still need good leadership yeah so yeah
[00:32:03] like you like I'm basically confirming what you just said the good business model will get you
[00:32:08] to a certain level but then to get to the next level you're gonna need leadership and that's why
[00:32:13] leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield mm-hmm so what the moral don't necessarily
[00:32:21] be tyrannical little in fact don't be straight up tyrannical don't be and I'm not saying that
[00:32:28] there's not times where you have to have a little tyrannical flare because they're there maybe
[00:32:33] times where you need to where you need to flare up a little bit yeah but it should be rare
[00:32:39] yeah it should be rare the problem is it becomes a crutch for people and then they just continue
[00:32:42] to do it more and more and more and then it doesn't work it's like it's kind of like drugs to
[00:32:48] regret the like when you like when you flare up on someone and and you win or whatever you know
[00:32:53] you kind of like it worked yeah I worked and you kind of like it feels good feels powerful
[00:32:58] so I think some people that's how you know so they'll do it in an a work and they'll be like yeah
[00:33:03] I will need that little yeah and what's even worse is like when you when that's where you you learn
[00:33:08] from someone that's what you saw and then you do it and you go out work for me too and all you have to
[00:33:13] be is treat people bad and be a jerk and yell and my subordinates will do what I tell them to do
[00:33:19] and they will right a subordinate will if you bark at them and scream at them they're going to
[00:33:24] do what you say at the moment the problem is what kind of team of you built that's the problem
[00:33:29] what is that subordinate going to do when you're not there they're going to do everything they can
[00:33:33] to cut corners and and really they don't care about they don't care about you they don't want to
[00:33:37] do good job for you yeah so when you're not there they're not going to do a good job for you yeah
[00:33:41] so you get addicted to yelling and screaming but it doesn't work in the broad sense of what you're
[00:33:47] trying to make happen yeah slowly pulling apart that's a question i'm 26 years old i'm currently
[00:33:54] an undercover detective i've recently been told that i'm being promoted to sergeant over department's
[00:34:01] investigations division i've been the youngest person to hold that position in our department's history
[00:34:06] all the guys i'll be in charge of our much older some in their late 40s how do i as a younger
[00:34:13] leader lead them how do you demand an earn respect from an older group i'm ready for the job and
[00:34:20] know what the job entails but i'm nervous to lead a group of nine people that are all older than me so
[00:34:27] i'm i've answered this question over and over again and i'm going to do a quick job over here just
[00:34:32] because people may not they have gone back and listen to all all the other podcasts but you
[00:34:39] have listened the answers always the same and it's always the same whether you're a young person
[00:34:43] leading old person whether you're an old person leading young for people whether you're a woman
[00:34:48] leading man a man leading man leading women whether you're coming in from a different department
[00:34:53] into a new department that you don't know anybody whether you're going into a thing that you
[00:34:56] don't have the experience it's like all of the same basically what it is you're going into a
[00:35:01] leadership position yeah that's what it is be humble listen take advice build relationships keep your
[00:35:07] ego in check also that one of the reasons i pulled the dead pull this question i was like how do
[00:35:12] you demand respect will be answers you don't demand respect and if you don't if you do demand
[00:35:19] respect you'll get anything but respect from people so so get that out of your head you earn respect
[00:35:26] and how do you earn respect you respect them in this case you respect their experience you
[00:35:31] respect their knowledge you respect it they've been doing it for a long time you have respect for it
[00:35:37] and when you show respect for them they're going to respect you back now none of this means be passive
[00:35:45] right this doesn't mean coward down no you you still have to lead you still have to step up
[00:35:52] but it does mean be humble be open minded be proactive listen ask questions ask for opinions
[00:35:59] decentralized all aspects of operations including the planning which we already talked about
[00:36:07] and then with all those things set a high standard and then the final and most important well
[00:36:14] I don't know it's equally important I'd say work harder than everyone else and expect nothing in return
[00:36:23] that's it that's it you're the boss you better be it you better be at work before everyone and you better be
[00:36:31] leaving work after everyone and that's how you develop a reputation of being a hard worker and being a
[00:36:37] hard worker and it's own right garners respect from most people there's there's a fraction of losers
[00:36:44] that are like oh echo he works so much it's it's so lame like no like as I'm making him look
[00:36:50] bad or something like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:36:53] like there's a small fraction of people that that might think that way but but no you work harder
[00:37:00] you you put in the time you put in the effort you study you read which you're supposed to read
[00:37:04] you get the professional knowledge that you're supposed to get you don't impose that on people
[00:37:09] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because you're your book knowledge when you start
[00:37:12] off in this situation your book knowledge isn't as strong as the experience guys in in this case
[00:37:17] you know in the in the law enforcement the guys that have been in the streets they know stuff that
[00:37:21] you don't know yeah so you study what you can but you keep an open mind so you can listen to
[00:37:27] what their experience says yeah okay don't impose on them wait when you say don't impose it
[00:37:36] on them does that mean don't impose them like make them it's like them echo section four two
[00:37:42] alpha of the document says that we're supposed to use this methodology when we do this
[00:37:47] you should know that methodology you should understand why that methodology is important but
[00:37:52] if you say hey juggle we don't do that way and here's why I shouldn't be like oh I'm telling you
[00:37:55] that's by the book yeah it's by the book now if it's by the book because it's there's an
[00:38:00] ethical reason okay well that makes sense but if it's by the book because that's what the book says
[00:38:06] but by the book yeah yeah or you know the guy who's like who works extra hard but he kind of
[00:38:11] in a way throws it in everyone's face how hard he works you know don't do that guy that's
[00:38:15] that's an important thing it's a very important piece don't you don't step on people's toes with
[00:38:19] this stuff yeah that's wrong don't do that yeah let's check check
[00:38:27] X-Wish juggle I'm extremely extremely driven and have high expectations for myself
[00:38:34] and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and their developing negative
[00:38:41] attitudes I feel like you're going to say play the game and develop relationships with them
[00:38:47] which are really just ignore who I am should I try to be someone different than myself
[00:38:57] yeah well you called it question person whoever has this question you called I it's exactly what
[00:39:05] I'm gonna say I'm gonna say you need to play the game look at what your current path has done
[00:39:10] look at what you the real you look what it's done the real you has created a negative attitude
[00:39:16] with all your team that's the real you so is that what you want to perpetuate
[00:39:23] creating negative attitudes against your with your team and by the way they're just getting started
[00:39:27] and if you think negative if you think you're going to keep acting the same way and the negative
[00:39:30] attitude they're going to somehow miraculously turn positive that's not happening they're going to
[00:39:34] get more negative yeah so when people have negative attitudes I saw somebody quoted this
[00:39:41] the other day on social media somewhere you know the quote was like no no no it's not my fault
[00:39:49] when I my subordinates have a bad attitude or something like that and about a bunch of people responded
[00:39:55] you should read the book extreme ownership because it absolutely is your fault it is your fault
[00:40:00] if your team has a bad attitude it's your fault you're the leader you only attitude if they're
[00:40:05] attitude is bad then it's then it's actually your fault now this is not to say that you can't
[00:40:09] have a bad apple on the team that's completely possible and who's responsible for getting rid of
[00:40:14] the bad apples you are you're the boss because the fact of the matter is you might have a
[00:40:19] uh bad apple on your team you might even have two bad apples on your team you don't have
[00:40:23] 14 bad apples on the team when you have 14 battles the apples on the team guess who the problem is
[00:40:29] it's you so here's what you do little little tactical advice trying get some perspective
[00:40:38] from them trying to understand where they're coming from what challenges they face what's pulling them off
[00:40:44] track and when you do this you kind of take ownership of it in your approach so you say hey guys
[00:40:51] I realize I don't think I'm really seeing things from your point of view and I need to because I'm
[00:40:57] here to support you and without you performing well then we fail so I think I need to do a better
[00:41:04] job supporting you and I can only do that if I know what your issues are so I can do my best to
[00:41:09] get them fixed so what can I do better to help you right so now they're going to start telling you
[00:41:14] all here's what here's that's problem there's that problem and then what you do is you listen to
[00:41:19] their problems you actually listen to their problems you don't say hey you're complaining
[00:41:25] no you actually listen to their problems and then you actually see what you can do to mitigate
[00:41:30] their issues and as you do that guess what's happening you're actually forming a bond you're actually
[00:41:38] forming into a team because you're working together to solve issues again I it sounds really simple
[00:41:46] right but clearly here's someone asking this question now again like if you have some members of the
[00:41:52] team that are that are actual negative complaining winers then you might have to get rid of them
[00:42:01] and that's part of being a leader is knowing when you have to get rid of someone
[00:42:08] you know I sometimes people they they take the extreme ownership attitude and they say you know what
[00:42:15] I'm the leader I own everything I'm extreme ownership and if someone's not performing well
[00:42:21] then that's my fault yeah that's my fault I need to coach more I need to I need to do it's my fault
[00:42:26] that my team member is not doing well and that's correct it is your fault it's your responsibility
[00:42:31] to train them coach them mentor and do whatever else you can do to fix them but at the end of the
[00:42:35] day if they still are not competent at their task and you've done everything you can it's
[00:42:42] your responsible to get rid of them that is also a part of ownership so
[00:42:49] yeah like I'll have someone complaining that they've got oh this you know one of my team leaders
[00:42:54] like they're talking about their subordinate team leaders no no one might this this guy is
[00:42:58] you just a bad leader why is he still here oh your team that team isn't doing well because
[00:43:04] they have a bad leader who's fault is that well the leaders fault no it's your fault you're
[00:43:08] in charge of the leader yeah is ridiculous so back to the original question
[00:43:15] you're whatever you call that you're who you actually are is not working well he probably is
[00:43:23] thinking he's a Steve Jobs type I have you know what you call we gotta do this but it's not working
[00:43:29] and he's not in a unicorn business model that's still making a ton of money regardless so
[00:43:34] what does he have to do play the game build relationships see the perspective of your team so that
[00:43:42] you can actually form a team be a better leader that's basically what I'm saying yeah so they
[00:43:51] and it's interesting the you know what they call framing you know you frame something
[00:43:58] in a certain way to make it kind of sound a certain way whatever so he's an extremely driven
[00:44:03] and have high expectations for myself and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too
[00:44:09] hard and they're developing negative attitude so having extremely being extremely driven and having
[00:44:15] high expectations doesn't equal driving them too hard so they develop negative attitude those are
[00:44:21] two different things you know you can still be extremely high expectations you can be driving
[00:44:30] extremely hard and you can still have a incredibly positive attitude with your team yeah no doubt
[00:44:36] yeah good point so and then it gets equated into that's just who I am so he just kind of put
[00:44:43] it all into one ball and without one there's no other kind of situation it's just not how it is
[00:44:49] so apparently you might be committed he might be committed to being all of these things and that's
[00:44:55] who I am and that's kind of it you know kind of thing and I think that's like the mistake
[00:45:00] planning people make we say this a lot where people will be like hey I'm just straightforward you know
[00:45:04] take me take it or leave it kind of thing and be like okay but you're gonna in your case lose you
[00:45:08] know in your in your situation that's the big piece is that in their case they're gonna lose yeah
[00:45:15] so let me ask you this question if you're so driven and you have such high expectations that you
[00:45:23] want to win so bad but the way you're performing as a human being and as a leader is going to
[00:45:29] make you lose then what are you supposed to do if you change the way you behave you will come
[00:45:35] a better leader yeah that's what you do yes sir so you take and this is total speculation on my
[00:45:44] part but you keep so this equation that we're presented with being extremely driven keep that
[00:45:51] high expectations keep that pushing your team hard keep that I would say too hard and that's
[00:45:56] gonna be a judgment call from day to day for sure but there's a parting here that's more implied
[00:46:01] that you're being an asshole somewhere in here you're being an asshole how about you take out that
[00:46:05] part take out the being the asshole part and then keep everything else see all that goes yeah
[00:46:10] because you kind of know when you're being a dick you don't see unless you're like not being honest
[00:46:14] with yourself there are some people that don't there's some people that don't get it
[00:46:19] there's some people that don't get it all right because it's like you know how like when you
[00:46:23] don't like people they just can't step outside of themselves and you said to me I wouldn't care
[00:46:29] kind of thing and be like bro you you know you're not me and why am I you kind of yeah you're right
[00:46:35] they kept attached yeah absolutely people that don't know yeah socially
[00:46:43] incapable of receiving you know clues social clues yeah people social cues from people yeah
[00:46:50] you know they don't see the look in their face when they're talking to them yeah that's true
[00:46:55] I mean I'm thinking of like three examples for sure there's all kinds of examples yeah also
[00:47:00] that then that would go back to what you're saying how you see get input from them you're just so you
[00:47:04] got to kind of yeah see yeah you can do it that's a solvable problem so this is a very solvable
[00:47:09] problem and I've seen people solve this problem I've helped people solve this exact problem
[00:47:16] and the weird thing is they think and it's part ego but it's also part they're just
[00:47:22] don't present they think they're doing a great thing like they think that they're
[00:47:28] driving everything that they're doing in their mind they're just awesome for being
[00:47:33] supproposient so hard it's just the way I am and all that stuff and they think it's awesome
[00:47:38] but again if you want to win so bad then you have to play the game you won't win
[00:47:45] by abusing people you won't win with a team anyways you won't it won't happen yeah
[00:47:55] it's no use being the best dancer if you're not invited on the dance floor
[00:48:00] I'll leave that one with you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:48:03] always that cool next question actually that problem is so solvable that you could this is
[00:48:09] possible where you could just show just that much like more I don't know caring or respect just
[00:48:16] that much respect and do for like two weeks yeah just the idea that just the fact that you're
[00:48:21] doing it now people will be like hey wait you should leave it here's the thing here's the thing
[00:48:25] if a person has an ego which this person could very well have a big ego because that's why
[00:48:31] they have these high expectations and that's why they're so driven because they just they
[00:48:35] if they have that kind of ego that's the person that you can't help because if they just look at
[00:48:40] the team and say those guys should be harder workers yeah those guys aren't working as hard as
[00:48:44] me they're not as focused as I am they don't care as much as I do so to everyone else on the team
[00:48:53] has a problem but I'm perfect and you can't you know look at how driven I am look at how focused I am
[00:49:00] look at how high my expectations are of myself but if you can here's another thing if your team
[00:49:06] cannot relate to your expectations like they don't even they don't even see him as realistic or achievable
[00:49:11] or anything what could have your expectations yeah what good are they they're only good okay
[00:49:17] they don't make any sense
[00:49:22] next question dear juggle I've been watching some of you YouTube links with great interest
[00:49:27] must be a subscriber to the YouTube channel yeah watch the videos I'm sure you're extremely busy
[00:49:36] but I have a question which if you have time I would greatly appreciate your reply I have taken
[00:49:41] the light opening very much so I'm going to incorporate that approach I've been I've taken up
[00:49:50] BJJ G2 recently in London in the UK so so a beginner I know you're a great advocate of the
[00:50:00] system but my basic question is your opinion does it truly relate to real life fight situations
[00:50:06] I'm a man now approaching my mid 40s in pretty good shape that I'm looking to focus on a martial art
[00:50:12] that would help me if I ever need to defend myself or my family I love the discipline and humility
[00:50:17] of BJJ and as a workout I know and I know the philosophy of BJJ is that most fights end up on the ground
[00:50:25] and it's here that BJJ excels but what of the other guys or what of the other guys who might be
[00:50:33] standing around ready to battle bottle you or kick you in the hand once you're grappling on the
[00:50:39] ground etc again this is a question that first of all we I mean I have to listen a lot of times
[00:50:47] sure but I'll answer it one more time here uh it.
[00:50:52] BJJ is the best place to start you should also learn boxing wrestling kick boxing this is all
[00:50:57] in discipline because freedom field manual so if you get that book you this will be laid out for you very
[00:51:01] well does so so yes that's what you should start studying with this guy mid 40s needs wants to
[00:51:09] learn something yes start with your jitsu does it relate to real life situations yes it does it absolutely
[00:51:17] does I've been in them it's extremely effective and you can see that over and over again speaking
[00:51:25] of YouTube you can see how effective your jitsu is in real fights now it's important to remember
[00:51:34] that for self defense the grappling arts in general should be used primarily to get away
[00:51:41] it to avoid going to the ground right like when you bring up oh well there's one of those
[00:51:45] other people that might be there you you should why are you on the ground jjitsu will give you the best
[00:51:51] opportunity to get up off the ground that's what it gives you and then you can get away from the
[00:51:57] people that are getting ready to stick you with a bottle smashed bottle or getting ready to kick
[00:52:01] you in the head if you don't know jjitsu guess what you're doing you're on the ground and you're
[00:52:04] getting kicked in the head and you're getting stabbed with a bottle that's why you train jjitsu
[00:52:08] so you can get up off the ground not so you can take someone to the ground because by the way and
[00:52:13] I've said this before if your goal is to punch me and you're standing at a punching distance or
[00:52:18] striking distance from me I can just run away that's myself defense I can get away from you
[00:52:23] so that's why we train jjitsu that's the primer that's why you should start with it
[00:52:32] because otherwise I'm just gonna get away from you if you're not grab if once you grab me though
[00:52:37] I can't get away from you anymore now I have to be able to do handle myself that's why
[00:52:43] I know jjitsu so I can handle myself once you've grabbed me if you're not grabbing me I can
[00:52:47] just get away from you I can just run away from you if you don't want to run away because it's
[00:52:52] gonna hurt your pride well then guess what that's that's why you train all the time
[00:52:57] I mean now we go back and forth and we can talk about all the negative things that will happen
[00:53:01] if you get into a street fight like the fact that you can get hurt you can get stabbed you can get shot
[00:53:04] you can get sued you can get arrested you can ruin your life you can do all these horrible things
[00:53:09] can happen if you get in a street fight so so so that's why my advice to you is to avoid street fights
[00:53:14] yeah that's what you do and by the way that's why you work on your awareness that's why you make
[00:53:18] your your your your wife and your children aware of what's going on around them to pay attention to
[00:53:23] what's happening in the street so one thing that was interesting when I was in Australia and I was in
[00:53:27] the nice part of Australia there's and I was talking to some people about it you know there's just
[00:53:33] a very relaxed atmosphere where I was I was standing at a very nice part of Australia there's a
[00:53:41] very relaxed atmosphere when you're in America there's a heightened atmosphere there's a heightened
[00:53:49] awareness you have to have and depending on where you are and it's the same thing I'm sure in
[00:53:52] Australia I'll go on the way to the nice part I'm sure you could go to some some tough areas where you
[00:53:57] better be more aware of what's happening but teach your kids because some kids don't know the
[00:54:02] difference maybe you don't even know the difference of what to look out for what kind of people you
[00:54:07] need to watch out for in the street so work on that and then yes train and up here in U.K. and
[00:54:15] of course I've said this before if you're truly in a situation where you feel threatened on
[00:54:21] the regular basis well then what you need is a firearm because if someone's going to attack you
[00:54:28] with a knife or with a bottle or with themselves having a gun the only you did to it's going to help you
[00:54:33] boxing is going to help you as scream is not going to help you someone has a gun so yeah and
[00:54:41] by the way oh yeah if you're in a knife fight and you know some a scream of that will help you
[00:54:46] but what if the other guys better than you what what if there's two of them the minute you put
[00:54:52] two people against one the odds of winning are it just extremely low extremely low does it happen
[00:55:00] yes it happens can you knock someone out yes you can that's why you train boxing yeah so
[00:55:07] yes again train some jiu jitsu start there and go and keep going and don't stop yeah yeah
[00:55:14] it seems like this question always comes from a place where they just assume all these things and those
[00:55:18] things are I'm going to choose to get in a fight with someone bring it to the ground in the middle of
[00:55:23] the street or in the club I don't know wherever wherever there's potential other attackers with bottles
[00:55:28] man kicks to the head and so all these things are just assumed kind of like yeah you take
[00:55:33] jitsu now you can go to the club and get in fights and win all the time it's kind of like that's
[00:55:37] kind of where the questions coming from where how you said yeah it allows you to get up and so
[00:55:43] basically it allows you to control your situation your fight scenario yeah more yes and I would even say
[00:55:50] it allows you a lot more to control it because even if even if you do take it let's say you take it
[00:55:56] to the ground I met more by a little bit more than nothing yeah no yeah I'm saying a lot more
[00:56:02] because really when you think of it and I try to granted them yeah even like at a beginner level so
[00:56:09] let's say okay if you choose to engage with someone and some kind of fight right it's up to you how
[00:56:18] heavy you want to take that fight you you want to go to 10 you go to 10 you want to go to just one
[00:56:22] you can go to one so if you wind up on the ground which is the worst place to be if you don't know
[00:56:27] anything on the ground yeah and that's a side from how you said if the guy's a gun in shoot you
[00:56:31] that's a dare you're talking about that's not even a fight scenario that's you know
[00:56:35] so you wind up on the ground it's a gunfight yeah if you know boxing you're gonna have
[00:56:45] almost no control over that scenario we're in the comments on the ground top yeah yeah
[00:56:49] your boxing is your boxing is not worthless you know marginalized we'll say but it's
[00:56:55] heavily marginalized yeah heavily marginalized yeah same thing with you know kickboxing and whatever
[00:57:01] so there's that if you know Jesus you're just a little bit of Jesus too if you're on the ground
[00:57:07] you have control over the fight more depending on your level whatever so if you if you're at that
[00:57:13] point still facing a threat of someone with a bottle or kicks to the head or whatever while you're
[00:57:17] on the ground compare if you know Jesus you're still saving way more control way more so
[00:57:25] meanwhile like the box situation or karate situation whenever it's gonna be less effective in
[00:57:30] controlling your situation no if you don't look at it like that like if you look at it like okay
[00:57:37] this guy's squaring up to me now I want to mess it up as quickly as I can then okay you know like
[00:57:43] you can do boxing and just take it to ten but you don't have the option of taking it from one
[00:57:48] two through nothing like yeah but the other thing is like it's hard to knock someone out
[00:57:55] that's the thing it's hard to knock someone out does it happen yeah it does happen and it can
[00:58:01] happen you do it can happen you do it's but it's hard to knock someone out and it's it's risky as
[00:58:08] soon as you start saying okay you and I are gonna just trade punches there's a risk for both of us
[00:58:13] there's a risk for me the assurance of me being able to handle the situation the way I want it to go
[00:58:20] by closing the distance with you getting control getting a hold of you if I'm trained and you're not
[00:58:26] you're you're you're you're you're done you're done right that's the way it works yeah and then
[00:58:32] even then that's like if you choose for this guy to be done so if you're if your sole purpose is to
[00:58:37] keep yourself safe yeah you could just put the guy to sleep and walk away yeah or gently
[00:58:41] lame down like I'm not even heard I'm not gonna put him to sleep nothing mount you see a guy
[00:58:45] you can see the guy coming with a bottle or whatever anymore if you know you get to so yeah well there's
[00:58:51] the whole thing of when you're just used to the physical contact the the the body's
[00:58:58] clashing and you know grappling let's shock yeah so yeah trained to get to train boxing wrestling
[00:59:07] kick boxing and then of course now people will be like what about judo yes trained judo
[00:59:11] what about sombo yes trained sombo what else what else do I need to cool what about
[00:59:15] crawvlogger sure train it yeah train everything yeah I'm down I think star would you do
[00:59:21] what you said on a real general level is the most critical things like when someone gets a
[00:59:25] hold of you like and you put this into perspective a while ago when you were like yeah if someone
[00:59:29] wants to fight you walk away for run away you can use a butt and you said all these scenarios you
[00:59:35] run away you go away you want to keep yourself safe you don't be there the best thing to do to avoid
[00:59:40] the the getting punched falling on the curb dying getting stabbed getting kicked getting stabbed
[00:59:45] with the bottle getting arrested getting lawsuit getting all those things happening the best thing
[00:59:50] to run away walk away yeah leave fully and then you said but what happens when you can't run away
[00:59:56] because I grab there you have it yeah so yeah so it seems like yeah I'm gonna train boxing so
[01:00:02] I can do self-defense oh no you want to fight somebody that's what you want to do you want to
[01:00:05] punch people in the face well boxing juditsu I mean yeah I mean boxing is a skill that every
[01:00:13] but he should have not everyone good people should have because there's two critical things on
[01:00:19] that that you learn from boxing is how to punch people and how to avoid getting punched yeah
[01:00:23] and how to keep your guard up right it was an important it was a really important skills to have
[01:00:27] yeah fully but what what I mean is if you're starting from nothing and you're like okay I'm
[01:00:32] gonna you know I'm gonna choose to address myself defense you situation you have a fantasy
[01:00:39] that you saw a guy on youtube that was clearly a boxer knock up knock out two people in a street
[01:00:44] fight and you're like that's what I'm gonna do yeah yeah and what you actually watched was a guy
[01:00:49] that was a golden gloves boxer yeah who is sober knock out two drunk idiots and guess what a
[01:00:56] golden gloves boxer will do that if you're a part of the golden gloves boxer they're freaking good
[01:01:01] they're freaking good they're they're they're you know like a black belt in boxing yeah
[01:01:09] and they will knock out two drunk guys all day long yeah yeah it's weird too because he kind of
[01:01:16] but if one of those if a third drunk guy or even that first drunk guy grabs a hold of the
[01:01:21] boxer and just and gets him to the ground the boxer's gonna be in trouble yeah that's the way it is
[01:01:26] we and this is like my thoughts this is fact this is like I talked about this in this
[01:01:32] in the field manual is like look there's no conjecture it's not like I wonder what would happen
[01:01:39] no we know what happens we know what happens when two people fight and and you can watch all the
[01:01:46] different various types of styles going at it and you can watch what happens and sure you can find
[01:01:54] the rare video where hey this boxer knocks out a couple drunk people or or or even hey the
[01:02:00] boxer knocks out the jutsu guy does that happen yes it can absolutely happen that's why you train
[01:02:04] boxing too yeah next question I've not been working out regularly regularly for several years now
[01:02:12] obviously I'm fat and lazy but I want to get after it so the question is should I go all in level nine
[01:02:20] destruction maximum madness or ease into it at level three cruising edition respect all right well this
[01:02:29] there's a couple different approaches now when I hear this first of all you you don't want to get hurt
[01:02:36] right and you also don't want to make yourself trying do things that are so hard and so painful that
[01:02:43] you can't do it repeatedly so if you just destroy yourself what do you say if you destroy yourself
[01:02:49] level nine destruction maximum madness but then you can't work out for two more weeks
[01:02:53] well guess what what you do in the mean no let's say realistically you got domes
[01:02:57] come sure right delayed onset muscle so let's say you did so many burpees that your legs
[01:03:05] you couldn't sit down without your legs being in pain so now so you take so you take three days
[01:03:13] four days have you ever had domes so bad that you took four days off no okay let's say you take three days
[01:03:18] off what did you do during those three days did you hold the line did you stay on the path
[01:03:23] are we you eating cheetos yeah yeah that's what you were doing so if you destroy yourself
[01:03:31] to where you can't stay on the path that's not good you want to stay on the path
[01:03:37] I think doing something that you can handle or maybe something just beyond what you can handle
[01:03:42] every single day is more important so going at a level not not cruising level
[01:03:47] not level three but let's let's find a solid level five where you can you're pushing yourself
[01:03:53] I read a thousand words a day when I'm writing and do the equivalent of that right
[01:03:59] the reason I read because if I said okay I do not just to today I just have to write
[01:04:04] five thousand words that's five hours yeah we do I have five hours today no I don't
[01:04:10] I can squeeze out 52 minutes though and get a thousand words written that I can do so that's
[01:04:15] that's what I think you need to do you need to get consistent if you bite off more than you chew
[01:04:22] then you can chew you you might very well choke on it so don't so don't do that
[01:04:27] so pick something realistic don't do people say that that must be the first time I heard it
[01:04:33] so if you bite out more than you can chew you might choke on it did you make that up or you get
[01:04:37] that from somewhere I think I well I just I don't know I think I made it up just good but I'm sure
[01:04:42] something like no this guy said it in 1978 yeah but that's the beauty of it so pick something
[01:04:50] realistic like for something that you can handle and then get after it then the other thing here
[01:04:55] is he doesn't talk about this diet at all and that's clearly equally important and you have to change
[01:05:05] your diet if you're going to change your life and you're going to change your health so stop eating
[01:05:08] sugar stop eating processed foods no more soda and juices and no more gatorade
[01:05:15] just to start with whatever is whatever that it is that you're doing
[01:05:19] whoever asks this question whatever you know what you're doing if you're eating donuts
[01:05:25] don't don't eat donuts anymore stop just stop eating those get rid of that sugar sweetness
[01:05:30] craving thing yeah and then just keep making your diet cleaner and cleaner as time goes by
[01:05:38] so that's what I think is there any time that it's good because sometimes I think it's good when
[01:05:48] people do go like alright man I'm doing yeah like I whatever happened they went up the staircase and they
[01:05:55] they got all tired and they said you know what I'm done yeah it starts tomorrow but I think in
[01:06:03] those cases most of the time who was it who was it that we were talking to talking to someone
[01:06:09] someone that they are I was talking to someone that their first thing they tried to do they
[01:06:14] couldn't do it all like they tried to run three miles and they were like you know what can't do it
[01:06:21] can't run three miles oh might have been that guy there's a guy that's losing a bunch of
[01:06:25] weight on the interwebs oh yeah that's what I think he's down in Texas but he's trying to lose a lot
[01:06:31] of weight and your first time we went try to go for run didn't happen didn't happen so he had to
[01:06:39] just run less or he had to just walk actually so yeah you start with what you can do but there
[01:06:48] is a little bit of there is there is I would try I would say this keep this one in the in the back of
[01:06:55] your mind there is the whole thing of like you know what I'm changing my life right now you go home
[01:07:01] you get the garbage can out you bring it into the kitchen you throw away the twinkies you throw away
[01:07:05] the pop-tarts you throw away the the you pour the the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the
[01:07:11] path and you just don't look back yeah that's a good thing to do too yeah but again if that person's
[01:07:17] 300 pounds they're not gonna be able to do I mean they're gonna push themselves yeah they could
[01:07:24] push themselves too hard so you just gotta be careful yeah so and that it's funny when um when I'm
[01:07:30] kind of looking at the question I'm like well obviously you want to start slow right obviously but then
[01:07:37] I don't know you hear about these guys just like how you said they just they throw everything away
[01:07:40] they're like I'm a different person right I think I think we're we're crossing streams here
[01:07:45] are I am there's diet and then there's like workout yeah because diet you can pretty much go
[01:07:52] cold turkey today yeah it lets and you may or may not be able to relate to this but if you go
[01:07:58] straight extreme on your diet like all of a sudden you're hit with these the byproducts of
[01:08:04] changing your diet especially if you if you'd like like mountain do every single day
[01:08:09] right and you just all of a sudden boom stop drinking month you'll go through stuff that you
[01:08:13] might not expect like the craving will hit you so hard and then you're gonna be on free and
[01:08:18] minimal doses of mountain you know yeah basically basically I'm gonna say no stop drinking
[01:08:24] mountain you don't need it and I think and you're gonna go through withdrawals right yeah
[01:08:28] if you're caffeine withdrawals and sugar withdrawals you're gonna get the the keto flu and
[01:08:33] all those things are gonna happen and it's gonna be rough but yeah but don't just say it like
[01:08:36] that it's gonna be rough but that's all good bro seriously if you go into that and you experience
[01:08:41] these types of things and then it's gonna apply to everything by the way any big change that you
[01:08:45] make where you you have to deprive yourself of these bad things that you've become kind of addicted to
[01:08:49] whatever you're gonna go through all kinds of changes and that goes for workout too by the way
[01:08:53] because like just the sornus alone oh dang I want to expect in the sornus oh I'm like
[01:08:58] tired now because the workout like was kind of hard it's like oh shit I wasn't expecting that I was
[01:09:03] expecting to feel right after my workout everyone says whatever so you're gonna run into all
[01:09:07] these little things that don't tell you about and then it's like well I didn't sign up for that
[01:09:10] little part of it and then when I'm that little part and then you're gonna follow up I think the diet thing
[01:09:14] I think you're wrong I think the diet thing I think if you're I think it's very I think it's
[01:09:19] easier in fact to just be like I'm done it's not like okay you know what I'm only gonna
[01:09:23] get a quarter bag of cheetos a day from now on I don't think that works I think you got to be like
[01:09:30] no no no no no cheat us not no cheat us in my house but I do think that you could work out so hard
[01:09:37] that you're so sore that you that you say oh man I'm just too kind of like the
[01:09:42] Gigi into question earlier on like you could be what if someone's so sore that they can't do
[01:09:45] their job right and they're just sore all day at work well that's not cool so I think for diet
[01:09:53] you can you can go cold turkey or actually cold steak or hot steak and then I think for working
[01:10:00] out is the one you you you you figure out what you can do and you push a little bit harder but you
[01:10:07] don't go level nine maximum destruction madness I think you're wrong respectfully and which part do you
[01:10:13] think I'm wrong on diet I think if you go extreme with your diet I think it'll work for some people
[01:10:20] for sure but depending on who you are but I think you're more if you go extreme with the diet you
[01:10:25] don't like slowly phase out of the way you know it's interesting you know it's interesting I don't
[01:10:29] know if you remember I read a letter while back on the podcast about a guy that had read way
[01:10:34] the warrior kid and he like fixed his life and that guy did what you're saying he just made little
[01:10:42] changes you know he made little changes along the way so maybe it's person it's probably personality
[01:10:48] in fact let's just go ahead and say it's personality some people are going to just have to get
[01:10:53] the damn cheetos out of their house all of them yeah and some people say you know what I'm only
[01:10:58] going to have this one cup full of cheetos every day yeah and even that's okay but but here's where
[01:11:05] you got to be careful you may lie to yourself and you can lie to yourself yeah you can lie to yourself
[01:11:12] and they're like you know I don't really think that that that big of a deal today if I just have two cups of cheetos
[01:11:17] yeah yeah yeah nine cups of cheetos later you know what you see and then two cups and
[01:11:23] respectfully I don't like your cheetos example why because you're like I'm going to allow myself
[01:11:29] cheat okay don't allow yourself cheetos that's not how small of a change you're going to make
[01:11:34] if you're not going to eat cheetos anymore you're not going to eat cheetos anymore I'm saying like
[01:11:37] if you go extreme on your diet let's say you eat but but when you say what you're saying
[01:11:40] is hey I'm going to change my diet okay I used to eat every day I eat a whole bag of cheetos
[01:11:52] and now I'm only going to eat one cup of cheetos from the bag of day that's improvement it
[01:11:57] is improved and it's small improvement and if I could do that then why why is that not okay yeah
[01:12:02] okay if you choose to do that but okay now we're going into the specifics of a certain
[01:12:06] person's okay I think I would say this this is more along lines of what I'm thinking as far as
[01:12:12] specific examples if you're going to go if I'm going to eat one bag of cheetos obviously that's not
[01:12:16] all I'm eating I'm eating other stuff I'm the small change is I'm not going to eat cheetos anymore
[01:12:22] I'm going to cut out cheetos that's it I'm still not eating that good you know I'm going to cut out
[01:12:27] cheetos or let's say I get you know drive through every day three times a day okay
[01:12:34] I won't get drive through anymore or all that's a big change not necessarily depending on
[01:12:41] what you get going from three drive through the day to zero the house that not a big chance it's a big
[01:12:46] child is going from like and there's certain people actually I was talking to someone
[01:12:50] the other day that had lost 150 pounds of female and it was interesting her nutritionist
[01:12:59] she hired an nutritionist and the nutritionist said okay what are the foods you can't live without
[01:13:05] and we'll work around those yeah that's pretty cool thank you and what she said was I need cheese
[01:13:10] burgers and fries so then what she got told was something along lines of okay you can have cheese
[01:13:16] burger and fries on Friday yeah yeah instead of you know this this whole thing of I can never eat it
[01:13:24] now what I'm saying is there are people and I think I'm one of these people where it's like oh
[01:13:30] if I have cheeseburgers and fries today well then I might as well just get a mint chocolate chip milkshake
[01:13:34] with it and if I did that tonight then you know what tomorrow morning hey after you get done training
[01:13:41] maybe you know that cheeseburgers good yesterday I've had so maybe it's my own personal weakness
[01:13:45] but for me I'd prefer to be just like on the path yeah yeah that's why the 80 20 rule
[01:13:51] and I talked about this in the field manual the 80 20 rule maybe it works for some people and I guess it
[01:13:55] does work for me but I'd rather just be straight on the program you know what I mean yeah and and then
[01:14:02] and you know what you know Tim Ferriss has that thing where or he's talked about that thing where he goes
[01:14:07] six days hardcore strict and then the seventh day you literally eat whatever you want as much as you can
[01:14:15] and I even tried that I have and it's really really good because you feel really really good not
[01:14:24] and it's only physically but just about the whole I'm on the program and you kind of know and on that
[01:14:29] on that cheat day you do they call it the cheat day you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any
[01:14:34] guilt at all even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to become an off a real strong
[01:14:40] week to like be to feel good about cheat for three like three burgers are good too yeah and that's
[01:14:48] you've been really that bad of a cheat day a cheat day is like fries fries then you're starting to go
[01:14:54] into it for sure but the I'm like you know a cheat day cheat day like asked Tim held
[01:15:00] it'll be like for like a whole thing of donuts re box a cook yeah whatever you want straight up
[01:15:05] whatever you want this is disgusting here's the thing though with when you when you start to eat
[01:15:09] healthy and you then you try to eat a whole box of donuts you're after like one two three maybe six
[01:15:15] eight donuts you're gonna be like you know you're in six donuts easy you're in six donuts in one
[01:15:21] oh my gosh you know those I think they're called Intimins Old Fashion they're you know
[01:15:25] we'll know that you know little chocolate Domets you know what a total full size donut straight
[01:15:30] up they're kind of a little bigger too you know you know oh you know oh you know I can't even
[01:15:38] fat of eating six donuts ever since I started talking so much smack about donuts yeah I
[01:15:44] know I can't literally can never have when you get in my life yeah you're not allowed for sure
[01:15:48] 100% yeah you know yeah even if you were like if someone was like hey just bumping
[01:15:54] in the back when I was a little kid my parents would buy the chocolate doughnuts the host's chocolate
[01:15:58] yeah that's like what we'll covered in chocolate those things are good yeah yeah yeah you can't even
[01:16:03] have one of those again no no you know I did the six day cheat program no even then okay I can't do it
[01:16:09] you know you know the old fashion donut is right it's like a don't with the whole it right
[01:16:15] no it's called old fashion donuts they're like um it's they're kind of glazed and almost like
[01:16:19] not they're not crispy but they're kind of hardy are hard and okay on the outside and then
[01:16:24] they're regular soft donuts and then they say and they have this glaze or um okay so I think it's
[01:16:29] I forget the name I think it might be vitamins but they have old fashion donuts where they're not
[01:16:33] as hard but they're kind of hard and they're just bigger anyway those are my favorite ones
[01:16:38] and I used to get chocolate milk and heat up the chocolate milk so it's like hot chocolate and
[01:16:41] donuts and oh yeah I easy money like I'll eat two bucks for those for sure oh I used to
[01:16:47] now yeah so the point there is on the cheat day you just go yeah no shame but after the things
[01:16:55] you can't just eat donuts four times a day or three you just don't feel good like your stomach
[01:16:59] gets all upset and the more healthy you eat the more it's gonna be like that so the longer you're
[01:17:04] on the path you straight like if you ate some donut like the other day we went to the
[01:17:10] Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream some mid-chocolate chip ice cream was it good
[01:17:14] fine it was good but you know the kids are doing whatever's tracks the other night
[01:17:19] yeah you eat a big large double you know what after after that you're like
[01:17:23] but I don't feel right you know so unless you're just committed to eat it because I don't
[01:17:27] know you don't want to waste it or something like that you're gonna be like oh my cheat your
[01:17:31] cheat day is not gonna be that bad it's what I'm saying okay but I know you have that
[01:17:35] we don't make it happen depends on what it is yeah yeah yeah you could pump some chili fries or something
[01:17:40] I don't like chili fries all right so yeah maybe what's the verdict I think just in the like
[01:17:49] middle of the road not the whole story like same thing I said balance so you're saying balance as
[01:17:54] well I'll tell you though man if that balance doesn't work for you you're gonna have to step it up
[01:17:59] you're gonna have to go hardcore I'd give yourself two weeks two weeks for a balanced approach
[01:18:04] on the diet side if you can't get your shit under control in two weeks you got to go
[01:18:09] hardcore you got to get in there with a garbage client can throw away the Twinkies throw away
[01:18:14] everything else that's crap in your fridge and go hardcore and start with a fast too right
[01:18:20] you know hey a fast is awesome a fast for a good way wait I don't even know that there's that much
[01:18:26] to expect don't ever for a day if you never done it before it's not that bad of a deal there's no
[01:18:31] little stuff don't eat your day there's little there's not take you from a normal human being
[01:18:37] this little stuff that you if you're not if you go in and not prepared for it then you're like
[01:18:44] I actually think the more you think about it prepared for it the more psychologically or it is
[01:18:48] yeah just be like oh yeah you know what I woke up this morning I haven't eaten last night
[01:18:52] call I'm not gonna eat until tonight every time that's a fast yes so when I'm trying to like that
[01:18:57] when I'm like I'm not gonna eat till this then I go through little stuff but if I just happen if I'm
[01:19:01] two into work I'm only drinking coffee and I forget and like dang if if I eat not having
[01:19:06] an eight for like you know 12 hours 16 then I'll be like oh I'll just go another three that's my
[01:19:11] 15 because like 15 right 15 hours is when your body starts to kind of shift over to like
[01:19:16] I think 15 okay so I'll just wait that shower it's like cool done but if we're playing it that's
[01:19:23] when yeah I don't know but it depends on who you are but that's like I agree with the fast off
[01:19:29] yeah I agree with a kick things off and get like jump onto the path yeah this jump on with a fast
[01:19:35] yeah hey go see your doctor whatever do you have to go see a doctor to fast 24 hours
[01:19:41] I think you should if you've been probably yeah yeah yeah yeah a fat lazy you know especially if
[01:19:49] you're older or something like that I think seen a doctor is it how old is it to get a personal trainer
[01:19:55] depends on when you need to help me the woman I just talk to she's like personal trainer
[01:19:58] and nutritionist hired them both lost 100 whatever pounds so yeah I think she was an
[01:20:05] excessive 300 pounds yeah and when I matter she's completely normal right like you know completely
[01:20:11] like you wouldn't even suspect that she had any weight trouble in her life yeah that's pretty amazing yeah
[01:20:16] so hire the trainer hire the the nutritionist yeah I think so I think that helps
[01:20:24] I always looked at it like why would I hire like a trainer or something like that when I can
[01:20:30] kind of look up that stuff but here's the thing I went in with this bias like because I kind
[01:20:35] of had a background in it so I'm like why would I I can just go look but I'm looking it up but I have
[01:20:40] all this other knowledge the same rule you try it for two weeks see if you can keep yourself
[01:20:46] on the path and if you can't got to bring someone in right here's what I like hire a trainer
[01:20:52] but not like the kind every day it's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program
[01:20:57] yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's gonna depend on who you're straight up you don't who can keep you on
[01:21:03] yeah that's the biggest part of all this and I've said this a billion times like you know what you
[01:21:09] need to do yeah you know what you need to do you know you know what you need to do if you can't get
[01:21:14] yourself to do it maybe you need to get someone to help you do it yeah the weird thing is like
[01:21:20] nutritionist and stuff you can get nutritionist that could come to you and be like okay we're
[01:21:23] gonna put you on a low fat diet you know what you'd be really not good seeing you in the wrong
[01:21:28] there yeah I don't know how many you think there's still nutritionists that are doing that right now
[01:21:31] oh yeah there are I know there are actually there are out there so you're gonna be careful right
[01:21:38] check next question last thing that I'm not gonna draw it out but you said
[01:21:46] you know what you need to do and one time you said imagine what your day would look like like
[01:21:53] if you like everything you did was you did the things that you knew you're supposed to do kind of
[01:22:00] thing well the the full the full statement is if you wrote down tonight what you were supposed to do tomorrow
[01:22:08] yeah and then you did the things that you were supposed to do yeah imagine how that day would feel
[01:22:14] and imagine what you'd get done in that day yeah and then imagine if you did that every day for
[01:22:19] a week yeah and imagine if you did that every day for a month and they did it for a year and
[01:22:24] imagine where your life would be your life would be in a completely different trajectory completely
[01:22:27] completely different yeah and that's true with working out that's true with nutrition that's true
[01:22:32] with business that's true with education that's true with knowledge to with everything everything
[01:22:37] yeah kind of know what we're supposed to do yeah well I thought you were going to say
[01:22:42] some people don't know what to do.
[01:22:44] I'm not could be the case.
[01:22:45] Some people they've never worked out before.
[01:22:47] And if you're a person that's never worked out before,
[01:22:50] you probably need to bring someone into the game
[01:22:52] that's gonna help show you how to work out.
[01:22:54] If you've never done any reading about eating,
[01:22:58] and you have no idea what's gonna be good for you,
[01:23:01] you're probably a person that might need to bring someone
[01:23:03] into the game to help you get over that.
[01:23:05] Yeah, and it still completely goes with exactly what you said.
[01:23:08] It's like you know what to do,
[01:23:10] and even to help that, you know what not to do.
[01:23:12] Like when you're about to make decisions on me do this,
[01:23:14] or not do this, like you know which one is you should
[01:23:16] or shouldn't do.
[01:23:17] So let's say I don't know anything about working out,
[01:23:20] but I know I have to get in shape.
[01:23:22] We all know.
[01:23:23] We all know when we gotta get in shape.
[01:23:24] So then you know you gotta hire somebody.
[01:23:26] You know you gotta do something.
[01:23:27] You know that you shouldn't just be like,
[01:23:29] oh well, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:23:30] I don't know, I'm not gonna do it.
[01:23:31] Things to do tomorrow.
[01:23:32] Yeah, the trainer.
[01:23:33] Yeah.
[01:23:34] Join a gym, get a trainer.
[01:23:36] Yeah, I don't know what to do.
[01:23:37] Okay, this is what you can do.
[01:23:38] Find out what to do.
[01:23:39] There you go.
[01:23:40] Then in that case.
[01:23:41] So you gotta make sense.
[01:23:43] Sometimes when you put things in, just say stuff,
[01:23:45] just put it on the table.
[01:23:47] Just starts to make sense.
[01:23:48] Mm-hmm.
[01:23:49] Next question.
[01:23:50] I'm a veteran of the infantry,
[01:23:52] and when I took over a fire team
[01:23:55] for the first time, I made the mistake of drawing
[01:23:57] hard lines in the sand.
[01:24:00] This immediately alienated members of that team
[01:24:04] that had been together for some time.
[01:24:05] I did not make that mistake again,
[01:24:08] and I definitely learned from my experience.
[01:24:11] So clearly there's not a question there.
[01:24:13] Yeah.
[01:24:14] And I forget pulling this out from,
[01:24:17] I get a lot of emails and messages and all that,
[01:24:19] but I thought it was a good point to bring up
[01:24:23] to say, this idea of drawing hard lines in the sand,
[01:24:28] and what that does to your leadership position.
[01:24:31] It's difficult.
[01:24:33] It's usually not a good thing to do.
[01:24:34] If you draw a lot of hard lines in the sand,
[01:24:36] and eventually you realize that they're either
[01:24:40] unrealistic or people can't maintain them,
[01:24:42] you're set yourself up for failure.
[01:24:45] What is that exactly like drawing lines?
[01:24:46] So it's a no matter what.
[01:24:48] We will not go to blah blah.
[01:24:52] Yeah, there's the like no matter what.
[01:24:54] We will win every single road march
[01:24:58] that we do as a fire team in this while we're here.
[01:25:01] Oh, it's training thing.
[01:25:03] Okay.
[01:25:04] Well, guess what?
[01:25:05] That's a hard field.
[01:25:07] There's other, there's some other fire teams
[01:25:09] that are also want to win.
[01:25:11] And so you've drawn a hard line to say,
[01:25:13] and that's not really a good example.
[01:25:17] A good example will take no matter what.
[01:25:18] We're gonna muster every morning at 4.30 in the morning.
[01:25:21] No matter what.
[01:25:23] And you know, then the guys are out on patrol
[01:25:26] until 2.38 in the morning.
[01:25:29] And now the next morning, a good no matter what.
[01:25:31] I say no matter what.
[01:25:32] Well, it's not good for them.
[01:25:34] It's unrealistic.
[01:25:35] So you drew a hard line in the sand
[01:25:37] and now you got to back it down.
[01:25:39] So and all you have to do is soften the statement a little bit.
[01:25:42] Hey guys, to the best of our ability, if we can,
[01:25:44] we're gonna get here every morning at 4.30 for monster.
[01:25:47] There's a little, there's a little room to play there, right?
[01:25:51] And that's, that's fine.
[01:25:53] So again, there's, there's not a lot of,
[01:25:58] there's not a question here.
[01:25:59] But one of the reasons I think that,
[01:26:01] that I wanted to talk about it was because I think people look at me.
[01:26:06] Yeah.
[01:26:07] And even hear me on a peripheral level.
[01:26:10] And they think all, I bet, John,
[01:26:12] would just lay down the hard lines.
[01:26:14] It's my way or the highway, right?
[01:26:18] Yeah.
[01:26:19] And the, the opposite is actually true.
[01:26:23] And the reason that I came to that conclusion
[01:26:29] was because I worked for leaders like that
[01:26:32] and I hated working for leaders like that.
[01:26:35] So I tried to never be a leader like that.
[01:26:41] And there's a dichotomy, right?
[01:26:44] There's a huge dichotomy.
[01:26:46] Because this doesn't mean that you're not driving and pushing.
[01:26:49] This doesn't mean that you're not saying,
[01:26:51] hey, we're gonna be the best,
[01:26:52] whatever, we're gonna be the best task unit here.
[01:26:55] Doesn't mean you're not saying,
[01:26:56] hey, look, we're not gonna rest
[01:26:58] until we've done what we're supposed to do.
[01:26:59] Doesn't mean that.
[01:27:00] Mm.
[01:27:03] But man, you gotta find that balance.
[01:27:05] Yeah.
[01:27:07] It does feel like that with you.
[01:27:10] That you're like, it feels like that,
[01:27:11] but when you're one, I mean,
[01:27:13] my experience obviously is,
[01:27:15] we're under no extreme circumstances.
[01:27:19] Right.
[01:27:20] But just like just like the simple stuff.
[01:27:21] Like it really does seem like you wake up at 430 in the morning.
[01:27:23] Every single morning, do or die.
[01:27:26] 100%.
[01:27:27] That I did.
[01:27:27] That I do.
[01:27:28] Oh, unless like there's sometimes where I get home at,
[01:27:31] like I remember a little while ago,
[01:27:33] I got home at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning.
[01:27:36] And that's basically my cut off zone.
[01:27:38] If I'm getting less than 4.5 hours of sleep,
[01:27:41] then I'll be like, oh, yeah, I'll wake up
[01:27:44] and I've been like, hey,
[01:27:45] I only got 2.5 hours of sleep last night.
[01:27:47] That's not enough.
[01:27:48] I'm going back to bed.
[01:27:50] Right, that's what I mean.
[01:27:51] Where I've tweeted that out before.
[01:27:53] Yeah, I'm the entire.
[01:27:55] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[01:27:56] that's what I mean.
[01:27:57] Yeah.
[01:27:57] So it's like when that happens,
[01:27:59] it almost like it catches you off guard, you know,
[01:28:01] when you when you did that,
[01:28:03] I mean, obviously not like, oh,
[01:28:05] drop cool start, it's not that feeling at all.
[01:28:08] It's just kind of like, oh, dang.
[01:28:10] You do have that flexibility when, you know,
[01:28:13] when it's the correct thing, kind of thing.
[01:28:15] Yeah, you have to.
[01:28:17] Yeah, you're not a slave to your, uh,
[01:28:21] rigidity.
[01:28:22] Well, what you're saying is I don't draw hard lines
[01:28:24] in the sand.
[01:28:26] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:27] Really?
[01:28:28] Yes, exactly right.
[01:28:30] But it's real easy to go down the slippery slope
[01:28:32] of like, well, you know what,
[01:28:34] I actually didn't eat real good yesterday,
[01:28:36] so I probably need some more sleep to recover today.
[01:28:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:39] Really?
[01:28:40] Yeah, well, I am, it's a rest day.
[01:28:43] So I might as well turn on the TV.
[01:28:44] You know, I'd be good with TV's maybe some popcorn.
[01:28:46] Oh, you know, it'd be good with some popcorn,
[01:28:48] maybe some cheese sticks.
[01:28:49] And some other setups.
[01:28:51] It's a rest day, right?
[01:28:52] Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:53] I'm looking for wrong path. It's only free.
[01:28:56] It's only saying.
[01:28:56] I guess the opposite of the, of the path
[01:29:00] is the slippery slope.
[01:29:01] Exactly right.
[01:29:05] Next question.
[01:29:06] Hi, scenario.
[01:29:08] It's actually legit way to think of it, too.
[01:29:10] Yeah.
[01:29:11] If it's a legit way to think of things,
[01:29:13] if you're on the path, when you know what the path is
[01:29:16] as we talked about with Tim Ferriss,
[01:29:18] if you're on the path, which you know,
[01:29:21] when you step off the path,
[01:29:23] it's a slippery slope.
[01:29:24] You know, it's off the path.
[01:29:26] Is a slippery slippery slope?
[01:29:28] Yeah.
[01:29:28] What'd you just say?
[01:29:29] The popcorn can lead to cheats sticks
[01:29:32] can lead to paminums.
[01:29:34] That's the slippery slope right there.
[01:29:35] Yeah.
[01:29:36] And sometimes you slip so hard that you just plunge deep.
[01:29:42] Off the path.
[01:29:43] Yeah.
[01:29:44] Fall off the wagon land hard.
[01:29:47] scenario.
[01:29:48] My team leaders boss came to me and asked my opinion
[01:29:51] on my horrible team leader.
[01:29:54] Okay, the boss is boss.
[01:29:56] One of my opinions.
[01:29:57] So what do I do?
[01:29:58] Praise him to make the team look good and maintain my relationship
[01:30:01] with my with the team leader or tackfully tell the truth
[01:30:05] and build a relationship with the boss with my boss's
[01:30:08] ball.
[01:30:09] Hey.
[01:30:09] That's a good question, isn't it?
[01:30:10] I think this is a really tough position to be in.
[01:30:14] Because you have to be careful and you have to be balanced.
[01:30:16] And there's a couple of things to think about.
[01:30:18] First of all, no one likes rats.
[01:30:20] Yeah.
[01:30:20] Right?
[01:30:21] No one likes rats.
[01:30:24] But at the same time, you kind of also have to think about what's
[01:30:27] best for the team.
[01:30:29] On top of and kind of the opposite of no one likes rats is no one likes
[01:30:32] brown nosers.
[01:30:34] No.
[01:30:35] But at the same time, you have to build relationships up and down
[01:30:38] the chain of command.
[01:30:39] And one of the toughest things about this and what you have to be so
[01:30:43] careful about is that you don't know what kind of relationship the
[01:30:46] boss and the team leader have.
[01:30:48] You don't know.
[01:30:50] I'll one end of the spectrum.
[01:30:51] They could be friends.
[01:30:52] So if you say something bad about them, that's going right back to the
[01:30:55] team leader and you're going to have a hard time.
[01:30:58] You're in a much worse position.
[01:31:00] Also, they could be enemies.
[01:31:04] And supporting the team lead to the boss could actually make you look
[01:31:10] stupid, right?
[01:31:11] Make you look bad.
[01:31:15] And it's important to say here.
[01:31:19] Is it the optics of like I don't want to look bad?
[01:31:23] Is that what I'm talking about?
[01:31:25] Because that's what I just said.
[01:31:26] Like it'll make you look bad.
[01:31:27] It'll make you look stupid.
[01:31:29] The reason that you're trying to look good is because you want to do a
[01:31:33] good job because you want the team because you want the mission succeed.
[01:31:36] That's what's important.
[01:31:38] And you don't care.
[01:31:39] I don't care if I have to eat crow.
[01:31:41] I don't care.
[01:31:42] So I don't mind looking bad if it's for a good reason.
[01:31:46] I don't mind my ego taking a ding if it's for the right reason.
[01:31:49] But this could actually hurt the way I do my job.
[01:31:56] Because now my boss, sorry, my boss is boss.
[01:31:59] Things I'm kind of an idiot.
[01:32:01] And so that means when comes time for promotion, even though I might be the best guy,
[01:32:04] I'm not getting promoted because I was the guy that was too blind to see that my team leader
[01:32:07] wasn't idiot.
[01:32:10] So I would be very careful and fairly neutral in what I said, especially to start with,
[01:32:19] right?
[01:32:20] So if the boss says, hey, how's that team leader doing?
[01:32:24] My response to be like, oh, you know what we get the job done.
[01:32:28] There's that's so non-committal, right?
[01:32:30] What about the team leader?
[01:32:32] Is he a good leader?
[01:32:34] I think he's, I think he's got a pretty good hold of what's going on.
[01:32:38] So that's, there's room to interpret that in any direction.
[01:32:41] Really?
[01:32:42] I think he's got a pretty good hold.
[01:32:44] I think he's getting a hold of what's going on.
[01:32:47] Or another one would be, well, hey, how's your team leader?
[01:32:52] I think our performance kind of shows where we're at, right?
[01:32:56] So you're not, you're not giving away.
[01:32:59] And those are, those, like I said, those are subtle and those are very open things that
[01:33:02] you could respond to.
[01:33:04] And I think the more your boss probes or the, sorry, the more the team boss team leader's
[01:33:12] boss is probes.
[01:33:14] The more you could open up a little bit still with caution.
[01:33:18] But as you see what the boss's opinion is, you could open up a little bit more and share
[01:33:25] a little bit more of the truth very tactfully.
[01:33:28] Or if, or you could go in the other direction, right?
[01:33:32] If you just, oh, you know, that's my best guy.
[01:33:34] And I've known Bill forever.
[01:33:36] Yeah, Bill's, I brought him here and Bill's going to be, he's going to play.
[01:33:41] So are you going to derail that guy?
[01:33:43] You can, but you're probably going to derail yourself too, because that guy has a legitimate
[01:33:48] relationship with him.
[01:33:51] So that's a tough situation.
[01:33:55] And I would say the best thing to do in this situation is remain as neutral as possible.
[01:34:01] And again, you know what, there's, there's someone that's listening, or to this right now,
[01:34:04] let's go in, oh, Joc was kind of a, Joc was kind of a whim.
[01:34:07] And if I was there, I'd just tell the truth.
[01:34:09] Okay, so let's, let's talk about that.
[01:34:11] Let's talk about what happens.
[01:34:12] Because I've been in that situation more times than I can count where my boss was kind
[01:34:16] of an idiot.
[01:34:17] And I get asked by his boss, hey, how's this guy doing?
[01:34:21] So let's say you rat him out.
[01:34:23] Well does that mean that the boss gets fired immediately?
[01:34:25] No.
[01:34:26] It just means that your team is less respected.
[01:34:29] It means that you get less support.
[01:34:32] It means, and if you do get rat it out by the way, where do you end up now?
[01:34:38] You end up in a bad situation where your boss knows that you ratted him out to his boss.
[01:34:44] You're hated.
[01:34:45] Yeah.
[01:34:46] You're hated.
[01:34:47] So I want to win.
[01:34:49] Let's go back to that point.
[01:34:50] I want to win.
[01:34:51] So does it help me win if I rat out my boss?
[01:34:55] Or if I rat out my team leader to my boss?
[01:34:57] Does it help me win?
[01:35:01] It could, it could if your boss happens to be completely aligned with what you're thinking.
[01:35:07] He also happens to have a replacement ready.
[01:35:10] That's more squared away.
[01:35:11] That's another thing.
[01:35:12] You get rid of one bad team leader.
[01:35:13] Now you get a new team leader.
[01:35:15] How do you know him?
[01:35:16] Who's that?
[01:35:17] Who is that person?
[01:35:19] Where did they come from?
[01:35:20] The devil's, what is that saying?
[01:35:21] The devil you know is better than the devil that you don't know.
[01:35:25] So if I have a team leader that's not doing a good job, who's fault is that?
[01:35:30] Why?
[01:35:31] Yeah.
[01:35:32] I can help my team leader.
[01:35:34] Especially if my team leader is weak, I can help them become strong.
[01:35:36] I can help teach them.
[01:35:38] Taxfully, not stepping on their toes.
[01:35:40] I would rather than rat my team leader out of the chain of command, I would rather fix my
[01:35:46] team leader.
[01:35:47] I would rather help my team leader become better, support them.
[01:35:52] And by the way, when you do support your team leader and they become better and now they
[01:35:55] do come up for promotion, what do they know in the back of their mind?
[01:35:59] They know that you helped them.
[01:36:00] They knew that you got them there.
[01:36:02] Guess who's getting promoted now.
[01:36:03] You are.
[01:36:04] Now why am I so concerned about getting promoted?
[01:36:06] Because I want to want to out do everyone else?
[01:36:09] No, that's not why.
[01:36:10] Because I want to win.
[01:36:12] I want the team to win.
[01:36:14] And if I thought that you echo would do a better job.
[01:36:17] If you became team leader instead of me, I'd be like, hey, I appreciate it.
[01:36:20] But echo would do a better job than me.
[01:36:21] He should be the team leader.
[01:36:24] So and also, if you're really, this is what happens.
[01:36:30] If I'm really a person, this is this is what I'm getting at.
[01:36:33] If I'm really a person that really wants to get promoted, and that's my main goal.
[01:36:36] I want to get promoted.
[01:36:37] That's my goal.
[01:36:38] What do I do with the team leader?
[01:36:40] I throw him under the bus.
[01:36:43] So that's the person that we all hate.
[01:36:46] The person that rats out the team leader that says, oh, that guy's doing a terrible job.
[01:36:51] I do much better job and gets that guy fired.
[01:36:53] Now I get promoted.
[01:36:54] What do we all think of him?
[01:36:56] We all think that guy's a turd.
[01:36:59] Now as opposed to the sum of that says, you know what?
[01:37:01] Our team leader's weak needs help.
[01:37:03] Need support.
[01:37:05] I'm going to help him.
[01:37:06] I'm going to support him.
[01:37:07] I'm going to do the best I can.
[01:37:09] Wait, are you saying to tell the boss this?
[01:37:10] No, it's just having that out of you to have that attitude.
[01:37:12] Like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to film one of the bus.
[01:37:14] Now if we have a guy that's horrible, that's tyrannical, that does a horrible job,
[01:37:20] that abuses people, then we get to a situation where you say, you know what, boss?
[01:37:25] There's some problems.
[01:37:26] So if you have that one, which doesn't really, well, this guy says horrible team leader.
[01:37:31] So if this is a horrible team leader, that's irredeemable, irredeemable qualities, and it's
[01:37:38] negatively affecting the team, because he kind of makes it sound like, make the team look
[01:37:42] good.
[01:37:43] So there's, there's still a possibility that the team is doing okay.
[01:37:45] You know, they have a horrible leader because they are good, such good troops.
[01:37:48] I would see that sometimes.
[01:37:49] The platoon has a bad leader, but there's great guys in there.
[01:37:53] And the platoon leader is smart enough just to be like, okay, I'm going to let them kind
[01:37:56] of run with it.
[01:37:57] They'll be successful.
[01:37:59] Yeah.
[01:38:00] So my goal, usually, is to help the person above me and the chate, well, it's always
[01:38:06] to help the person above me and chate, come on.
[01:38:08] Can you get to a situation where someone is so bad that it's negatively affecting the
[01:38:12] whole team and you can't win because they're positioned?
[01:38:16] Yes, well, then you need to step up and do something about it and say something about
[01:38:19] it.
[01:38:20] Do it tactfully, do it slowly.
[01:38:23] Don't overcommit to your statements early on, because if you do, you might say something
[01:38:28] that is out of line.
[01:38:31] So that's, it's a tricky situation.
[01:38:34] There's no definitive answer.
[01:38:36] You have to weigh these things out.
[01:38:39] Generally, if you can help someone win, you're going to win.
[01:38:43] Generally, if you help someone win, you're going to win.
[01:38:45] If it's so bad that they're just bringing down the whole team and you cannot win with them
[01:38:51] in that position, you might need to say something.
[01:38:54] Yeah, especially if everyone on the team kind of feels the same way.
[01:38:57] It's going to be a little bit easier to be like, hey, you know, and be straight.
[01:39:01] But even if everyone, if we have the gang mentality, like, hey, man, the boss sucks, you
[01:39:07] know what?
[01:39:08] He's team leaders horrible.
[01:39:10] He doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:39:11] Hey, guys, you know what?
[01:39:13] We can sit here and complain about it or we could actually try and make him a better leader.
[01:39:17] Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:18] What do you guys say at think of that?
[01:39:19] And then, because hey, we could try and get a replacement form, but at least he listens
[01:39:23] to us right now.
[01:39:24] Yeah.
[01:39:25] Or whatever.
[01:39:26] You know, at least he, at least he understands the job.
[01:39:27] Hey, let's try and, let's try and prop him up.
[01:39:29] Let's try and get, we know what, let's get rid of him, but let's get rid of him by teaching
[01:39:32] him a lot.
[01:39:33] So he gets educated so he can move on to get promoted and then we'll have a good relationship
[01:39:36] with him.
[01:39:37] Yeah.
[01:39:38] And then the team will get more support and then we can do our mission better.
[01:39:40] Yeah.
[01:39:41] Yeah.
[01:39:42] I guess he kind of doesn't understand what makes them a quote unquote horrible for sure.
[01:39:46] For sure.
[01:39:47] For sure.
[01:39:48] Like, what if I don't like him?
[01:39:49] Cause I don't like his tie.
[01:39:50] I don't know.
[01:39:51] I don't like his hair do.
[01:39:52] You know, I just don't like him.
[01:39:53] We don't, we don't come from the same side of the tracks.
[01:39:54] I don't know.
[01:39:55] I mean, one of the things that would be like if the guy's arrogant, the guy's arrogant,
[01:40:00] well, how are we going to bring him down?
[01:40:02] How are we going to bring, well, how are we not not bring him down like bring him down
[01:40:06] from his job, but how are we going to bring down his ego?
[01:40:09] How are we going to mellow him out?
[01:40:11] And that could be a long project.
[01:40:14] That could be a long project.
[01:40:16] Yeah.
[01:40:17] So it's like, you say, is it damaging the performance kind of thing?
[01:40:22] Yes.
[01:40:23] That's the most important thing.
[01:40:24] Is that what is our performance like?
[01:40:25] Yeah.
[01:40:26] Can we bring this guy around?
[01:40:29] Good question.
[01:40:30] I'm sorry.
[01:40:31] There's no definitive answer, but at the same time, there's leadership is an art.
[01:40:39] Yeah.
[01:40:40] And why did the, it's an art and science?
[01:40:42] But it's an art.
[01:40:43] Sure.
[01:40:44] This is a case where the artistic part is going to be more important.
[01:40:46] Yeah.
[01:40:47] Yeah.
[01:40:48] The dichotomy.
[01:40:49] Art and science.
[01:40:50] And what I'm blood sport, how we called martial arts, martial science.
[01:40:53] The guy I was in, since it's a tenaka.
[01:40:57] All right.
[01:40:58] Come on, bro.
[01:40:59] Bloods worked.
[01:41:00] Fendam.
[01:41:01] Yeah.
[01:41:02] No, I know what the movie is.
[01:41:03] Yeah.
[01:41:04] He called it martial arts.
[01:41:05] I'm sorry.
[01:41:06] I'm familiar with that.
[01:41:07] Two, two, three.
[01:41:08] Even as a kid, I thought those movies were really cheesy.
[01:41:09] Yeah.
[01:41:10] Can you see?
[01:41:11] Like, I saw a lot of MMA.
[01:41:12] Well, I guess from my age, MMA, gosh, you know, I was in the blood sport.
[01:41:17] Yeah.
[01:41:18] Even when I was a kid, I wasn't thinking blood sport was legit.
[01:41:22] I don't know why.
[01:41:23] I thought it was.
[01:41:24] None of the parts were getting.
[01:41:26] I thought Rocky, I thought Rocky was more legit.
[01:41:28] Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:29] Okay.
[01:41:30] I thought I thought that Rocky was more legit than blood sport for me.
[01:41:35] Bloods sport seemed fake.
[01:41:37] Yeah.
[01:41:38] Yeah, I guess.
[01:41:39] Right.
[01:41:40] It just seemed extreme, I guess.
[01:41:41] Because plus, I think with bloods sport, the rumors circulated, the tech I was
[01:41:45] real.
[01:41:46] That was real.
[01:41:47] You know?
[01:41:48] You're like, oh, you're sure it's a movie cool.
[01:41:49] Made fun, but it was real, you know.
[01:41:51] Yeah.
[01:41:52] I, I, I, yeah.
[01:41:53] Again, I, I wouldn't say I hated bloods sport, but like I haven't seen it enough to know
[01:41:58] that the guy referred to martial arts as martial science.
[01:42:01] That was early, early in the movie when the Vendam's teacher.
[01:42:06] You know what's your typical movie, right?
[01:42:07] There's a, there's a guy.
[01:42:10] He's getting beat down or whatever.
[01:42:12] He goes through his training process.
[01:42:14] There's a, there's a montage.
[01:42:15] Yeah.
[01:42:16] Like in a, like in a team of, team of America, world police.
[01:42:19] There's a montage training montage and then he comes back and wins.
[01:42:23] There's, there's like most of your fight movies.
[01:42:25] Yeah.
[01:42:26] You know?
[01:42:27] The montage.
[01:42:28] Yeah.
[01:42:29] He gets beat down early.
[01:42:30] You know, he trains.
[01:42:31] He becomes awesome.
[01:42:32] But then there's the art enemy who's trained to, but still a bully.
[01:42:35] And he has to beat him.
[01:42:36] Same thing with credit kid.
[01:42:37] But you're leaving out the montage part.
[01:42:39] Yeah.
[01:42:40] The training montage, which is very important.
[01:42:42] You're the best.
[01:42:43] Or, no, that's credit kid.
[01:42:45] You've ever seen the movie never back down.
[01:42:48] No.
[01:42:49] So you wouldn't, you'll never watch this movie.
[01:42:50] It's, it's, it's MMA, right?
[01:42:53] It's MMA.
[01:42:54] It's MMA.
[01:42:55] It's, it's MMA.
[01:42:56] Yeah.
[01:42:57] But it's just basically credit kid.
[01:42:58] It's literally like, credit kid, but just MMA now, and a little bit more cheesy.
[01:43:03] Maybe a lot more cheesy.
[01:43:04] I thought it was good though.
[01:43:05] I enjoyed it.
[01:43:06] I watched it more.
[01:43:07] I was able to learn from like a master, GJ2 guy or something.
[01:43:09] Yeah, Brazilian guy who, he is played by an African guy.
[01:43:12] The guy on, you know, remember, gladiator.
[01:43:14] You know, gladiator, right?
[01:43:15] Russell Crowe.
[01:43:16] Yeah.
[01:43:17] And the black guy.
[01:43:18] Yeah, he, you know, the one.
[01:43:21] Yeah, his main friend.
[01:43:22] He's the guy, but he's Brazilian guy.
[01:43:24] Oh, okay.
[01:43:25] It doesn't match because he's on the Brazilian accent.
[01:43:26] I was gonna say, how's his portrait Gj Sachsen?
[01:43:29] No.
[01:43:30] It's still African.
[01:43:31] But, nonetheless, you know, on paper it might seem cool, but it came up kind of cheesy.
[01:43:36] I liked it though.
[01:43:37] You know, they're over emphasize like all the things like he goes to the party and
[01:43:41] the party's just crazy anyway.
[01:43:43] Yeah, look into it.
[01:43:45] Nonetheless, yes, science and art, I dig it.
[01:43:48] You kind of have to, I mean, back in the question, yeah, I have to kind of wonder why
[01:43:52] the boss is asking your opinion, too.
[01:43:54] Is it just a general probe?
[01:43:56] Like, hey, how you guys doing?
[01:43:57] How's the boss doing?
[01:43:58] Kind of like that?
[01:43:59] Or is it, we have some concerns about your team leader, what up, you know, kind of
[01:44:03] think.
[01:44:04] Yeah, and even that, you got to be careful because they could lead you down that path.
[01:44:08] Trump.
[01:44:09] Maybe they're probing you.
[01:44:10] Maybe, yeah, maybe the team leader said, hey, you know what?
[01:44:12] I don't trust this guy.
[01:44:13] Yeah, you see what he says about me, right?
[01:44:16] And then you go in and you go, hey, you're, first,
[01:44:18] bad things about this guy, what do you think of them?
[01:44:20] Yeah, you tell you what you're right.
[01:44:21] Now guys, it's dirt.
[01:44:22] Yeah, it's dirt with ears.
[01:44:24] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:44:28] You guys, you just, yeah.
[01:44:29] Yeah, a lot of team guys say dirt.
[01:44:31] Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:32] I think I think it came from Buds at some point.
[01:44:35] Yes, it was, you'd get called turds quite a bit.
[01:44:39] And then a person that was kind of maybe just not a very good individual would
[01:44:45] be a turd years.
[01:44:49] Never heard that one.
[01:44:50] In Hawaii, they say, do do boy.
[01:44:52] Same thing.
[01:44:53] Do do boy?
[01:44:54] Do do boy.
[01:44:55] But obviously not in any kind of discipline setting.
[01:44:58] We're here one more question.
[01:45:01] Yes, next question.
[01:45:03] Last question.
[01:45:04] Jockel.
[01:45:05] I've been disciplined, working hard, and staying focused.
[01:45:09] But I've hit a run of bad luck, and I can't seem to get a break.
[01:45:16] Well, first of all, you are lucky.
[01:45:24] Because if you're capable of working hard, then that's a blessing.
[01:45:31] That's luck.
[01:45:33] Because there's people all over the world that don't have the ability for any number of
[01:45:40] reasons, many of those reasons being just bad luck.
[01:45:45] But they can't work.
[01:45:46] So right out of the gate, you're lucky that you can get up tomorrow and you can go to work.
[01:45:53] Now, you say you can't get a break.
[01:45:59] And maybe you're getting unlucky with your career or your personal life or your business.
[01:46:07] So what are you going to do?
[01:46:12] Are you going to give up?
[01:46:15] Are you going to surrender?
[01:46:17] Are you going to assume that because you didn't catch a break today, there's no way you'll
[01:46:22] catch one tomorrow or next week or next year?
[01:46:29] Are you going to leave it all the chance?
[01:46:35] Or are you going to do everything in your power to force luck your way to create opportunity
[01:46:43] to shift the hands of fate?
[01:46:50] And even then, if the break never comes, even if you roll across the finish line of life
[01:46:58] bruised and plundered and empty handed from the fight, at least you know that you went
[01:47:10] after it as hard as you could.
[01:47:16] Thank you, gave life everything you had.
[01:47:23] And you know in the end, you might still be unlucky.
[01:47:30] That could happen, but I would much rather be an unlucky soul that fought until the
[01:47:39] end and died with my sword in my hand than an unlucky soul that submitted.
[01:47:50] Boutdown, gave up and surrendered.
[01:47:57] So stop waiting to get lucky, stop waiting for a big break instead.
[01:48:06] Be thankful.
[01:48:08] For what you do have and go out there and fight and battle and brawl to make your own luck.
[01:48:28] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:48:36] So echo, speaking of fighting hard, is there anything you know about that can help us
[01:48:48] stay in the fight?
[01:48:49] Stand up like continue fighting hard.
[01:48:51] Check.
[01:48:52] Sure.
[01:48:53] First thing you need to do is take care of your body habitus.
[01:48:58] You use that word wrong, but body habitus is like your habitat.
[01:49:07] Take care of your body is what I meant.
[01:49:10] Including but not limited to your joints.
[01:49:13] A lot more important than I thought from the beginning or in the beginning.
[01:49:18] So how you do that is super cruel oil, jocco as super cruel oil.
[01:49:22] Jocco as cruel oil called super cruel oil.
[01:49:24] Another supplement called joint warfare.
[01:49:27] These are good for your joints.
[01:49:29] Don't neglect them.
[01:49:30] That's how you stand in the fight.
[01:49:31] Straight out.

[01:50:41] Jiu Jitsu immersion camp.
[01:50:43] All levels of Jiu Jitsu are welcome to this, by the way.
[01:50:47] Rubble kids.
[01:50:48] Kids welcome to that one.
[01:50:49] I don't think so.
[01:50:50] Yeah, because something they have the capacity for kids there.
[01:50:52] Yeah.
[01:50:53] Yeah.
[01:50:54] You should be asking me that.
[01:50:56] Interesting.
[01:50:57] Nonetheless, all levels.
[01:50:59] Even if you don't have any Jiu Jitsu at all.
[01:51:01] In fact, last time there was a group who didn't have, well, I think it was like, some
[01:51:06] didn't have any Jiu Jitsu.
[01:51:07] Yeah, no Jiu Jitsu.
[01:51:08] And it just came when I said, like, you know, like some of the stuff you learn.
[01:51:11] If you don't have any Jiu Jitsu, it's like, okay, that's not going to fit into my knowledge
[01:51:13] because you have no knowledge.
[01:51:14] So it's like, I don't understand this quite yet.
[01:51:17] We did the fundamentals class form.
[01:51:20] Yeah.
[01:51:21] Yeah.
[01:51:22] And even during, like, while it was going on, I had a group on the site of like a good,
[01:51:28] like, 12 people.
[01:51:29] And we're just doing just the basic fundamentals.
[01:51:32] No Jiu Jitsu.
[01:51:33] No Jiu Jitsu.

[01:52:24] Also, for fitness gear, you want to vary up your workout.
[01:52:27] You want to implement new movements, kettlebells.
[01:52:33] Do you do kettlebells?
[01:52:34] I know, jocking you do kettlebells.
[01:52:35] I know that.
[01:52:36] But that's the question.
[01:52:37] Yeah, you do.
[01:52:38] Mike Granchi.
[01:52:39] Right.
[01:52:40] Mike.
[01:52:41] This guy, you know, he's a brown belt or black belt.
[01:52:44] I forget.
[01:52:45] Up in.
[01:52:46] Carl's bad area.
[01:52:49] You have no info long time.
[01:52:50] Are you so work with a sister?
[01:52:51] I don't even know if you remember that.
[01:52:53] But so watching you know what you do Jeff Clark is?
[01:52:55] Yeah.
[01:52:56] Yeah, so he's on there.
[01:52:57] He hit me up.
[01:52:58] He's like, hey, I want to get into kettlebells now.
[01:53:00] He's like, I'm looking at the on at once or whatever.
[01:53:02] You know, asking the advice here's the thing.
[01:53:04] I'm not an expert on the kettlebells.
[01:53:06] But I do know this.
[01:53:07] Don't get nuts with them.
[01:53:09] But don't go too light either though.
[01:53:10] I bought a kettlebell for my daughter.
[01:53:12] She's five now.
[01:53:13] So it's just, it looks cool.
[01:53:14] It's like the one of the little 24 kilograms.
[01:53:17] No.
[01:53:18] No man, the smallest one.
[01:53:22] But when I picked that up, I'm like no matter what fitness level I'm at, this isn't
[01:53:25] going to do much for me.
[01:53:26] So don't go too light.
[01:53:27] This is what I'm saying.
[01:53:28] Yeah.
[01:53:29] Yeah.
[01:53:30] Nonetheless, get them from on it.

[01:54:46] Everywhere.
[01:54:47] Whatever you listen to podcasts on, subscribe.
[01:54:50] Yeah.
[01:54:51] It seems obvious.
[01:54:52] Also, YouTube, if you are interested in the video version of this podcast, you want to see
[01:54:56] what jockel looks like if you care.
[01:54:57] You want to see what I look like if you care.
[01:55:01] Which may be a little bit more of a thing because apparently I don't sound how I look.
[01:55:05] I still get that by the way.
[01:55:06] Yeah, no, I just talked to a guy about the other day.
[01:55:08] Yeah.
[01:55:09] Yes, yesterday.
[01:55:10] That'll never go in.
[01:55:11] No.
[01:55:12] I don't want to see me.
[01:55:15] Don't see me.
[01:55:17] Anyway, if you are interested in that YouTube video version of this podcast, also excerpts,
[01:55:23] take little chunks out of the podcast and post them so you can share them.
[01:55:27] So they don't have to listen to two and a half three hours of a whole podcast to get one lesson.
[01:55:31] One specific lesson.
[01:55:33] That's not a YouTube channel.
[01:55:34] No, no, you just made a new video.
[01:55:36] A daydia.
[01:55:37] Making more videos now.
[01:55:38] Time is running out.
[01:55:39] Time is running out.
[01:55:40] That's a good idea.
[01:55:41] That's a good idea.
[01:55:42] So I'll choose little excerpts or whatever to be like, you know what?
[01:55:46] This one to me hit harder.
[01:55:50] This little message that you said.
[01:55:52] And that one was because it is one of those ones.
[01:55:55] Because you know how the old saying where it's like, yeah, we know we had to have a limited
[01:55:58] time on this earth, but we don't act like it.
[01:56:00] Yeah.
[01:56:01] And that whole thing.
[01:56:02] And really when you think about that, that's more true than I think most people
[01:56:05] realize.
[01:56:06] And that's why people go through like midlife crisis.
[01:56:09] Right?
[01:56:10] You know how they hit a certain age.
[01:56:11] You're a person get a car of that.
[01:56:12] Yeah, I got to get it back.
[01:56:14] I don't know.
[01:56:15] It's that scrambling situation.
[01:56:16] You know, you're trying to scrambling to get more in.
[01:56:20] But you know, there's going to come in time.
[01:56:21] You can't do that.
[01:56:22] There's a little old school footage in there in that video.
[01:56:26] Yeah.
[01:56:27] Two of.
[01:56:28] If you want to see me when I was, I don't know, like 13 or 14.
[01:56:35] Maybe.
[01:56:36] Yeah, I was probably 14.
[01:56:37] I'm going to guess 14.
[01:56:39] Bronson's children.
[01:56:40] Bronson's children.
[01:56:41] Bronson's children.
[01:56:42] That was straight up it.
[01:56:43] You went through phases, right?
[01:56:44] Yeah.
[01:56:45] You did some great.
[01:56:46] It was hard to identify fully.
[01:56:50] The actual, because we had a bunch of different names.
[01:56:52] One of the names of the band was rage of discipline.
[01:56:58] rage of discipline.
[01:56:59] Age of discipline.
[01:57:00] It would never disciples of discipline.
[01:57:01] No.
[01:57:02] That's something else.
[01:57:03] Okay.
[01:57:04] A very simple discipline.
[01:57:05] It was rage of discipline.
[01:57:06] And it was struggle.
[01:57:09] It was lock and load, which is really militaristic for someone that wasn't in the military
[01:57:13] to be like my band called lock and load.
[01:57:15] I realized how cheesy that is now.
[01:57:17] No, that's pretty dope.
[01:57:18] No, I don't know.
[01:57:20] But anyways, rage of discipline's real military ish.
[01:57:24] See, right?
[01:57:25] You were even before.
[01:57:26] Yeah, that's what the guy you got.
[01:57:28] The video footage from Ellison James.
[01:57:30] He when he comes on the podcast, he's like, I'm going to tell people.
[01:57:33] I actually just spoiler alert.
[01:57:35] Because he said, I can't wait to tell everyone that you had a band called rage of discipline
[01:57:39] when you were 14 years old.
[01:57:42] And I was kind of laughing about that.
[01:57:44] Yeah.
[01:57:45] But you were in the making from the beginning.
[01:57:48] Yeah.
[01:57:49] Yeah, I guess you could say that.
[01:57:50] But you know, also I also look back and think, well, man, I did some dumb stuff when I was a kid.
[01:57:56] Yeah.
[01:57:57] Well, you didn't get a handle on the discipline, too later.
