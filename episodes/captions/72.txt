[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 72 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
[00:00:15] Sir casualties are inbound. One of the myths has been hit hard and we have casualties headed to
[00:00:22] the Folusa surgical. My head snapped up from my work. I quickly strapped on my nine millimeter
[00:00:29] and headed off to Folusa surgical. The level two trauma and surgical facility on Camp
[00:00:34] Folusa servicing the casualties and medical needs of the eastern portion of Alonbar province
[00:00:40] in Iraq. I had made a habit of going to the operating rooms to see and encourage the wounded
[00:00:47] whenever I was in the command post of two Expeditionary Force, MF, forward, at Folusa. My
[00:00:57] aid band and I made our way through the maze of buildings and walls of the camp something
[00:01:02] told me to hurry. I quicken my pace, then began to run. I hadn't done this before and I'm
[00:01:11] sure my aid was wondering what was up. As we rounded the corner of the hospital, I could
[00:01:17] see the up armored humvies of the mid team and the marine themselves standing near the entrance.
[00:01:23] They had their hands on their hips and their heads were down. This is bad, I thought.
[00:01:33] One of the Marines was lifting a set of body armor from the floor of a humvie and it
[00:01:37] was covered with and dripping blood. I quickly cleared my weapon at the clearing barrel
[00:01:45] and stepped into the facility. The medical personnel had become accustomed to my presence
[00:01:51] on these occasions and quickly briefed me on the situation. Several wounded one very
[00:01:56] seriously and the survivors were down the corridor in an office. I hustled down to the
[00:02:03] office and quickly got a situation report from the team leader and others of whom was wounded
[00:02:09] and waiting treatment. It had been a bad ambush and the Marines had fought for their lives
[00:02:15] alongside the Iraqi troops they were advising. Then looking up at me with an anguish you
[00:02:23] can only find in combat. The team leader said to me, in a hush tone, we think Travis
[00:02:31] is dead. I didn't immediately connect the name but I knew I needed to get down the corridor
[00:02:40] right away to the O.R.s with the incredible surgical teams working frantically on the wounded.
[00:02:48] As I stepped into the first O.R. the surgical team was just finishing their work. One
[00:02:55] of the nurses was crying openly. They had been unable to save this Marine and he had just
[00:03:02] died seconds before I stepped into the O.R. As I walked to the end of the gurney I was
[00:03:10] stunned to see Travis Manion. The wonderful youngster I'd known as one of my midshipments
[00:03:15] while I was common-dont at the Naval Academy. I had known his family, his dad, Tom, a
[00:03:23] Marine colonel himself and his mom Janet, a stalwart of the family. Travis had selected
[00:03:31] the core from a nappeless and though I had not seen him during this first this tour in
[00:03:36] Feluca I'd heard repeatedly of his courage and bravery as an advisor. One by one the doctors
[00:03:45] and nurses left the O.R. leaving me alone with Travis. I don't think I had ever prayed
[00:03:52] so hard for anyone or anything in my life as I did while alone with him and that empty
[00:03:58] O.R. His loss was very personal to me. Three years later while I was deputy commander
[00:04:11] at Centcom and headed ultimately to command the U.S. forces in Afghanistan I learned of
[00:04:17] an incident the previous night that had taken the lives of some of our magnificent special
[00:04:24] operators seals from Seal Team 3. They had been operating in the Zabu province south
[00:04:33] of the Hindu Kush and Afghanistan and had generally made the lives of the Taliban miserable
[00:04:39] the entire time they had served there. One of the finest young leaders in this Seal Team
[00:04:45] Brendan Looney looked and lived every aspect of the ethos of being a seal. This now
[00:04:53] legendary strata of American special ops community. That night we lost Brendan Looney.
[00:05:03] As with Travis, Brendan's death was not simply a loss to their respective units and
[00:05:08] missions. Losing them was a terrible blow to America which would now never benefit from the
[00:05:17] extraordinary qualities of these two men. The irony of their relationship and their seemingly
[00:05:26] unrelated deaths was nearly as tragic. They'd been roomates at the United States Naval
[00:05:34] Academy growing up together at this most hollowed institution of our naval service.
[00:05:41] They had faced the challenges of Navy and had emerged committed in ways few can understand
[00:05:48] without experiencing the powerful formative forces of anapolis. And in their intense sense
[00:05:55] of duty and their desire to serve one sought to be a marine the other a seal. Remembering
[00:06:04] the times it didn't take a fortune teller to guess where this would lead them both to
[00:06:11] war in Iraq or Afghanistan or both into war it did lead them. Extracting from them long
[00:06:22] separations from their families as they grew into the full realization of their roles as combat
[00:06:28] leaders. But it also extracted from them their last full measure. Their young lives willingly
[00:06:40] sacrificed for their country than these causes.
[00:06:50] While Manion has done us a great service in initiating the effort to tell this story.
[00:06:57] Yes, it's about war but it's less a history of two wars than it is about the human experience
[00:07:04] of war and what this newest generation of American warriors has experienced. It ties together
[00:07:11] these precious young lives and they're growth together as warriors as leaders and as brothers.
[00:07:21] This book celebrates what we hear more and more frequently that these young Americans
[00:07:28] on whose broad strong shoulders we have fought two wars and we have kept the wolf from
[00:07:34] the door in a numerical other places are the new greatest generation.
[00:07:43] With less than 1% of our population in uniform fewer and fewer Americans bear the
[00:07:48] brunt of the responsibility for military service and fewer and fewer understand the sacrifices
[00:07:53] made by men like Travis and Brendan and their precious troops.
[00:08:03] All of us who fought in these wars now pray that in the end the outcomes will justify the
[00:08:09] costs to America and its allies. Those of us left behind must ensure these sacrifices
[00:08:17] were not in vain and that these lives lost will have meaning and purpose now and in the
[00:08:28] future. And that is the forward of a book called Brothers Forever and that forward was
[00:08:43] written by John Allen who's a retired four star Marine Corps general and the book which is
[00:08:51] about Travis Manion and Brendan Looney is written by retired Marine Corps Colonel Tom
[00:09:01] Manion. Travis is dead and we are honored today to have Colonel Manion on the podcast
[00:09:13] to give us some insight into the lives of these two amazing men. Colonel Manion.
[00:09:25] Welcome Man thank you so much for coming on. Thanks for having me here guys.
[00:09:29] I'm honored to have you on here and I guess with a story like this we might as well go a little
[00:09:40] bit back to the beginning and a lot of Travis's life and folks that listen to podcast
[00:09:47] or you may remember the name Travis Manion because when Bryan Stan was on he talked quite
[00:09:52] a bit about about Travis and how much Travis helped Bryan try to learn how to wrestle.
[00:10:00] Try. No offense Bryan he did his best to teach you but it was never your best skill set.
[00:10:07] But obviously wrestling was a big part of his life and I'm going to go to the book now and here we go.
[00:10:13] He attended classes, studied and wrote his papers but always thought wrestling would best
[00:10:20] prepare him for being a warrior and leader on the battlefield. This belief was reinforced by the
[00:10:29] qualities he saw in Captain Doug Zembeck, a two-time all-American wrestler of navy who attended
[00:10:37] as many practices and meets as he could and frequently sparred with Travis.
[00:10:42] Be a battle axe Zembeck told him, hurl yourself into your opponent. I think that's good advice
[00:10:52] just generally in life. That's good. Be a battle axe. Zembeck a 1995 naval academy graduate
[00:11:00] had a big impact on Travis. In the young wrestler's eyes the gritty tough seemingly invincible warrior
[00:11:07] embodied everything he wanted to become, a skilled marine officer who used the wrestling mat to develop
[00:11:13] himself into a leader who commanded respect. Travis was a high school in college wrestling star
[00:11:20] after a strong junior year at navy which featured several epic matches against
[00:11:24] nationally ranked opponents he was presented the naval academy's weams award for dedication and
[00:11:29] leadership. As a preseason top 20 wrestler going into a senior season Travis didn't want to
[00:11:36] simply win matches and meets he wanted to dominate and help lead the midshipmen to a championship.
[00:11:45] So we do talk about wrestling a decent amount because we're heavy into grappling.
[00:11:51] So he was just starting wrestling at a kit. Yeah he started really early. He youth wrestling
[00:11:58] up through high school but like a lot of these guys at navy he did a lot of different things he did
[00:12:03] football and and lacrosse as well but wrestling was the sport that he really gravitated towards.
[00:12:11] Yeah well there's something that makes people gravitate towards wrestling and combat sports
[00:12:16] in general especially if you're a guy that's in the combat. You know there's something that's
[00:12:21] beautiful about it. Yeah and so he's going now the Penn State Open it's like the 2004
[00:12:27] tournament is senior year he's got a hurt shoulder that he should hurt his junior year
[00:12:31] I'm going back to the book here the Purdue the Purdue wrestler slammed his struggling opponent
[00:12:36] the ground for a take down with Travis's injured shoulder something squarely on the red and yellow
[00:12:41] mat. His right arm was already numb and this first blow left Travis with almost no strength
[00:12:48] to attempt the scape in a sport built on hand-to-hand combat one hand is almost always no match
[00:12:57] for two the match ended in the 11 to 0 shut out and that's a senior year. Tough day tough year you
[00:13:06] know he had a great junior year and had a shoulder that was given on problems and instead of
[00:13:14] getting a second opinion he went under the knife and it was a disaster. So start out a senior year
[00:13:22] looking for it to a big year and could never get the shoulder going again and actually one the Penn
[00:13:30] State Open with that bed shoulder out and how he did it and the rest of the year. But yeah the
[00:13:39] year just didn't turn out well for him it's very very disappointing for him because he had worked
[00:13:44] so hard towards getting to the nationals and being an all-mark and any had everything going his way
[00:13:50] but you know the injury just just zapped him. And obviously zapped him and I can't I never put
[00:14:00] that much effort into a sport when I was in high school I didn't I didn't do it am I am I kind of
[00:14:06] a loser because of that little bit a little bit but I never was that you know into a sport and so
[00:14:13] but I saw people that I knew and he definitely see it in the once you get in the teams you meet
[00:14:18] guys and they put so much into that sport then something like that happens it's crushing I
[00:14:23] think this was a good little pickup that he got after brief moment of silence the assistant coach
[00:14:30] gave Travis a reason to perk up telling the future military officer that though he's seen senior
[00:14:35] wrestling season was over it was now time for him to devote all his energy to becoming a marine.
[00:14:42] Yeah and it's coach Joel Charities now the back at Navy went to Air Force for a couple of
[00:14:48] years and came back he's now the head coach down there but a great coach great mentor and
[00:14:55] by the way it was a good friend of Doug Zimbax too so it's like comes full circle and I want to say
[00:15:01] that the Joel would have been a warrior in the Marine too he was a national champ at Iowa three time
[00:15:06] finalists for Dan Gable if you know anything about wrestling. Yeah he's he's the real deal
[00:15:11] yeah that's awesome and and it's interesting because in the book here you know you kind of
[00:15:17] start off with that story and you can see some definite strength of character from from Travis
[00:15:24] and then you take a little back step and you talk about early in his academy a career he doesn't
[00:15:31] want to do it and it's he decides I don't want to stay at the academy I want to go to a regular
[00:15:37] college I'm out all right and he leaves and I thought one of the best things about this was
[00:15:43] you know when when when you talk to him about it and I'll go to the book here you know who
[00:15:48] Travis comes to you and says hey I'm leaving the academy and like I said in the beginning your
[00:15:53] marine you could I can't imagine you could have been any prouder than having your son go to the
[00:15:57] naval academy and then the disappointment you must have had when you said oh you don't want to go
[00:16:02] 30 more but this is what you said to him go back to the book look this is your call and your decision
[00:16:10] Tom told his son who he always believed could excel with the naval academy and beyond
[00:16:17] but I think you're making a big mistake how did you know that one of the bad things you could
[00:16:26] done was like force him to stay there which you must have decided in your head like okay if I force
[00:16:31] him stay here he's gonna hate it and he'll be miserable and he won't put any effort into it I mean
[00:16:37] we I get asked all the time what would you do with your kids how much do you pressure him how did
[00:16:40] you come to that conclusion that that was the right move it's sort of how I always work with him you know
[00:16:47] I'm try to treat him you know as a man and let him make his own decisions give him advice coach him
[00:16:54] but at the end of the day he's gonna have to make those decisions and you know this was no different you know
[00:17:01] I was extremely disappointed but you know he I had a buddy there that was a batayan officer at the
[00:17:09] the naval academy and he gave him a hard time about leaving and that a major gardener yeah
[00:17:18] yeah lieutenant Colonel Gardner and in quirky gave him a hard time it's a time I'm not letting
[00:17:22] them leave let him go home for the holidays it changes mine and sure enough he came home and said
[00:17:27] you know I'm I'm going I'm leaving and I still remember quirky called me up and he said you know
[00:17:33] Tom if if he ever he did great here if he ever wants to come back you know he'll probably
[00:17:39] consider it I say quirky there's there's no ways coming back he's he's done and and sure enough
[00:17:47] you know I mean he came back to me later on that that following spring late spring we go to
[00:17:54] some other college yeah get a call from the wrestling coach come on down because I was given him
[00:17:59] so much trouble at home coach today you got a scholarship come on down so he left as soon as you
[00:18:05] could get out of the house and so you let him make his own decision you just made him pay for it on a
[00:18:11] daily basis so that's when when I didn't know that and I could not believe that they let him
[00:18:20] back in I mean that's awesome yes very very unusual and if you're out there and you're at the
[00:18:27] Naval Academy right now and I know I know you got quite quite a few listeners at the at the Naval Academy
[00:18:32] and at the and at West Point as well don't think you're going to get in that kind of treatment you
[00:18:37] need to just stay there trust me it's going to be worth it you ain't going to be fall travel's
[00:18:40] man you know this one now he pulled out the miracle and that one it really was has unbelievable
[00:18:46] and he gets back in I mean I guess with his wrestling skills because he did well
[00:18:50] did well academically did well on the wrestling team as a freshman but you know beyond anything else
[00:18:56] when he quit it's interesting because you know he he quit and he left and it made him really
[00:19:03] realize what he was missing yeah and when he went back into talk to people about going back he had
[00:19:10] the passion he knew exactly what he wanted to do and they could see it and you know I I would have
[00:19:15] conversations with guys that were kind of thinking about their their Navy career and there's a big
[00:19:21] there's a there's a transition that happens mentally with people and that is if they feel trapped
[00:19:25] they want to escape the minute that they don't feel trapped anymore then they're like oh what
[00:19:28] to go back in that cage so you got it if you can get them mentally out of the cage which is
[00:19:33] probably what what Lieutenant Colonel Garno was trying to do take go home for the weekend let
[00:19:37] see what it's like outside the cage and you're going to want to come back into the cage you didn't
[00:19:41] work that time but I'm always not a longer time outside the cage so when the guys would come to
[00:19:46] me and they'd say you know I'm thinking about getting out I'd say I wouldn't go no don't get out
[00:19:50] because then that's that's tightening the cage on them I'd say yeah man start looking what you can
[00:19:54] do on the outside you know why don't you go get a job there's some good jobs you know they got some
[00:19:58] good jobs you can get you know you can be an executive there's you know you could there's probably
[00:20:01] a good cubicle that would have a nice computer at it for you and everything I took but I would
[00:20:05] be not even be sarcastic about I just try and make them start thinking about what regular I mean
[00:20:10] you want to see all teams it's a ridiculously good life I mean it's it's a ridiculously good
[00:20:15] life so the minute you start looking at normal jobs in the world you want to get back in the cage
[00:20:20] so now he comes back and he ends up with a new roommate new roommate at the Naval Academy
[00:20:29] named Brendan Looney and I'm going to the book here Brendan and Travis who carried the burden of
[00:20:34] being division one athletes along with their academic and drilling responsibility rarely if ever
[00:20:39] complained just after the start of the 2001 fall semester Travis and Brendan met up from early morning
[00:20:47] run the restaurant football player both had practice later on that afternoon but as two varsity
[00:20:52] athletes who wanted to be the best they were determined to work harder than everyone else
[00:20:58] after talking about the start the NFL season their mid-job conversation shifted to their
[00:21:03] backgrounds they had a lot in common including the love of sports and their love of country
[00:21:10] both midship men had been raised Catholic the tight-knit families although Brendan's was a
[00:21:15] little larger with Brent Brendan had four a total of five I think total five siblings
[00:21:23] and so now we're introducing you know Brendan Moody into the into the story here and
[00:21:28] I actually knew Brendan slightly because when he was a seal he went through the training that I ran
[00:21:34] out here on the west coast for the west coast seal teams and just a stud you know that's you just
[00:21:40] a stud and the one thing I one of the things I remember about him was I was not you know the
[00:21:50] the most caring and affectionate instructor as a as a when I was running that training and
[00:22:00] he you know and guys would get little you know kind of freaked out sometimes when I'd be talking to him
[00:22:05] about the decision that they were making during the training and and he would just be smiling at me
[00:22:11] like yet hey sir got it makes sense sir you know with this mildest face just a stud just a straight up stud
[00:22:18] and so these guys are now fall 2001 and we know what's coming next September 11th comes
[00:22:25] and you know our country's under attack go into the book here and the entire naval academy student
[00:22:32] body realized that after graduation they would become part of a fighting force that was now at war
[00:22:41] and you know that's the whole military instantly thought that you know we were all thinking
[00:22:46] oh here we go yeah we had in 2004 it started to come home to us at Navy you know we had
[00:22:54] J.P. Blixmith with lost in the battle of Felicia around a windchester was lost over there around
[00:23:02] the same time both football players you know and now Travis has seen your year football teams coming
[00:23:10] out with the flag and they got Ronnie and J.P.s jerseys draped over the bench you know when it was
[00:23:17] it was coming home for all of us and he had guys like Doug Zimbeck coming back from the battle
[00:23:21] of Felicia and talking about what that was all about being in the wrestling room wrestling with Travis
[00:23:27] you know was was all over and Navy yeah that's a total game changer it was definitely like
[00:23:35] that in the sealed teams too you know we went from what was it years and years since Vietnam
[00:23:42] because we had some little you know there was Panama there was Granada there was some allia
[00:23:46] there were some things that happened but those were little flashes of combat action and all the
[00:23:51] sudden we were facing what's now turned out to be you know a decade and a half or more worth a war
[00:23:59] unbelievable these guys so you know as you said they're they're intensity it's just you know
[00:24:07] they might have been intense before but now their intensity is going to be through the roof
[00:24:11] yeah they know what's coming in May of 2004 Brendan and Travis graduated with their naval academy
[00:24:16] classmates and were commissioned as U.S. military officers Brendan would go to serve in the
[00:24:22] naval intelligence community while Travis would head to the basics school from Marine Corps officers
[00:24:28] in Quantico for Virginia so Brendan didn't get picked up for the sealed teams right out of
[00:24:36] right out of the academy which is fairly normal it's a really they only have a very small number of
[00:24:42] openings for guys from the naval academy and you can imagine how competitive it is to have a guy
[00:24:47] like Brendan not get picked up is crazy and so he goes out to go to go to the intel community
[00:24:55] and then Travis heads down to heads down to Quantico for the little bit of the basic school
[00:25:01] and and actually this was interesting and I I wasn't aware of this but the LaCross championships
[00:25:07] that those happen after they graduate they're see after they get commissioned the way it
[00:25:12] read in here it was like it happened after they got commissioned well it was it was actually it was
[00:25:19] the championship was after graduation that weekend the same same weekend he's been a lot
[00:25:24] of the weekend so and and Brendan at some point the naval academy started playing the cross
[00:25:31] yeah Brendan was a football player he went there was recruited for football
[00:25:35] and played football for a couple years dressed and played and decided that he wanted to go out
[00:25:43] for the cross both of his brothers are playing the cross and he went out there and just picked
[00:25:49] up a stick as you said earlier just such a natural athlete so gifted big strong and you know picked
[00:25:57] up a stick and by the time he was a senior in that championship game if you ask anyone who was
[00:26:02] the heart and soul that team it was number 40 Brendan Looney I mean he he led them all the
[00:26:08] way to the championship p and his two brothers were the the heart and soul the team yeah unbelievable
[00:26:14] and so they get to the championship game I'm going back to the book against Syracuse
[00:26:18] though navy followed with a goal Syracuse won its third championship in five years and eighth
[00:26:23] overall title Brendan was absolutely crushed by the 14 to 13 defeat this is supposed to be
[00:26:30] navy's day it would take some time for the loss to sink in but Brendan who had just played
[00:26:35] his final collegiate game and everyone associated with the navy program new deep down
[00:26:41] that the team's improbable final four run had been a truly amazing feat I don't think I've ever
[00:26:48] felt this low man Brendan grumbled we should have won that game I know Travis replied but don't
[00:26:56] do what I did to myself and wrestling what do you mean Brendan asked when I lost that
[00:27:01] match in Texas I thought my whole life was over I hadn't been that miserable since I quit the
[00:27:07] academy but there are bigger things out there think of what we're probably going to be doing
[00:27:13] a year or two from now so same thing you know a little bit of glory getting crushed right
[00:27:21] little glory getting crushed at the end there and you know Travis saying look man and this is
[00:27:29] true and I say this all the time you know sports with a ball and a referee and all that stuff
[00:27:35] it's a game you know and these guys are about to go into something that's no longer a game
[00:27:40] and that's where Travis recognized and and help Brendan see that going back to the book
[00:27:46] now that he was a young second lieutenant training at the basics school in quannico virginia
[00:27:50] was difficult for Travis to imagine that the months after graduation could be even more challenging
[00:27:57] but in fall of 2004 the harsh reality of war became more personal for Travis Brendan
[00:28:03] and their fellow naval academy graduates on September 2nd 2004 marine first lieutenant
[00:28:12] Ronald Winchester a driven popular former Navy football player became the first combat death
[00:28:18] in the naval academy's 2001 class when he was killed in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq's
[00:28:24] Alonbar province. Less than 48 hours later Travis and his fellow Navy wrestling
[00:28:30] alums were hit by another freight train upon learning that marine second lieutenant Brett
[00:28:35] Harmon a friend and teammate who had graduated in 2003 was murdered during a melee at a North
[00:28:41] Carolina State University football tailgate and that's a story that that Brian Stanton told as well
[00:28:50] what a tragedy that was I mean you know he was stepping in to help out and the guy came back and
[00:28:57] killed him and his friend was hit everyone hard Brett was a really popular guy
[00:29:03] and so coach Sharat he and again this is something that that Brian Stanton talked about
[00:29:13] you know when they were heading to the funeral and there we go let's do an exercise this is
[00:29:20] this is coach Sharat talking let's do an exercise I'd like you to both close your eyes and picture
[00:29:25] that you're leaving a building a friend picks you up and takes you to a place where people are
[00:29:29] somber crying and there seems to be an audience then you realize you're at your own funeral
[00:29:36] right down a few words about what you'd want a family member a person of faith to say when
[00:29:42] reflecting on the lives of Travis Manion or Brian Stanton Stanton nodded and after a few minutes
[00:29:48] of pondering what to write started drawing down a sentence about one day being remembered as a good
[00:29:54] husband or loving father and a US Marine Travis went through several pieces of paper before
[00:30:02] settling on one sentence Travis Manion was a man on a phrase to stand for what was right
[00:30:10] and as I mentioned earlier Travis started helping out Brian with his wrestling and
[00:30:27] and eventually as Brian started fighting because Brian's a maniac started doing MMA matches
[00:30:33] and he needed corner man so he needed to have the wrestling corner man and so again this is something
[00:30:40] that we covered with Brian's stand but for if you didn't hear it that first time there you
[00:30:46] got Brian's about to fight he's literally you know whatever 20 minutes half an hour from getting
[00:30:51] in the cage and fighting somebody and Travis gets a phone call and Brian can tell something's going on
[00:30:59] and Brian said hey tell me what's going on Travis says I'll tell you later
[00:31:04] Brian Stanton says you tell me now Travis looks away after the fight no give it to me straight
[00:31:14] Brian demanded what's going on and then Travis tells him JP Blacksmith was killed in
[00:31:22] Felusal last night so again your point is that these are people you know real close to home and
[00:31:33] it was tough for for Brian it's tough for anyone that's sitting on the sidelines which is what you
[00:31:38] feel like you feel like you can't you you want to help and you can't do anything you're back
[00:31:42] you're literally thousands miles away and that's what these guys are are feeling
[00:31:47] you a lot of frustration there but I think also at the same time it it built a lot of
[00:31:55] resolve with those guys I mean they were determined to make sure that they honored them
[00:32:00] in their service and work hard to to do all they could do to make a difference
[00:32:04] now there was a story told in here that I definitely wanted to go over because
[00:32:18] it revealed a little bit about Travis to me that was a little hard to pick up a little earlier
[00:32:25] and that was obviously that he was funny his health and didn't mind taking some risks so
[00:32:31] these guys are in a training situation and you know Travis was on the radio and he's given commands
[00:32:39] and he's given orders and they're being listened to by some higher-up training officer that's kind
[00:32:46] of monitoring what they're doing and so Travis is going back and forth on the radio with his
[00:32:52] guys they're doing some training and then as Travis pressed the button to on his radio to relay
[00:32:57] the final order allowed familiar voice suddenly overtook the frequency lieutenant this is
[00:33:03] coyote six the voice said I'm not really sure what you're trying to do out here but you're not following
[00:33:08] proper radio procedure sir Travis asked puzzle puzzle you need to figure out what you're trying to do
[00:33:15] because I sure as hell can't tell by listening to your orders over this radio the rising voice said
[00:33:21] do things right or do us all favor and just go home so okay Travis thinks about that and he
[00:33:31] just keys his radio and says yes sir so they're continuing they're doing a little bit more
[00:33:38] Travis has continued to direct his troops in this training operation and
[00:33:43] finally the voice comes on again lieutenant manion this is coyote six he said his dozens of
[00:33:51] eyes rolled I have a call I have to ask you a question son do you have any idea what the hell you're
[00:33:57] doing out there radio is dead silent for almost 30 uncomfortable seconds as everyone
[00:34:05] waited for the young second lieutenant's response no sir Travis said Travis said
[00:34:14] but I did stay at a holiday and express last night no for those of you that aren't the military
[00:34:20] when you key up on the radio it's not like I'm just cracking a joke to my boss did just me and him no
[00:34:25] there's like dozens and dozens if not you know 40 50 maybe even 100 people that just heard you say that
[00:34:32] so that was a positive comment funny risky but kind of showed in its classic it's great because
[00:34:41] that tells the guys hey look we're going to get through this we're going to push on we're going
[00:34:45] to make this happen so I thought yeah guys from first recon shared that story when they came
[00:34:51] came to our place and it was typical Travis you know and he said he just like everything got
[00:34:57] silent the coyote shut up and they said when they got back to the headquarters they wanted to meet
[00:35:02] this lieutenant he didn't catch me out from from coyote six on that coyote six got quiet that was it
[00:35:09] yeah he got punk so hard he just he just shut down he probably couldn't help but understand that yeah
[00:35:15] that was that was brazen but that was a good joke you know what you know it too I bet if he's a good
[00:35:21] guy and he's putting pressure on his troops he might have just seen him out of just sat back
[00:35:24] from his radio and just thought himself respect I've received that we got to respect what
[00:35:29] what's coming out from the holiday and express that's awesome so now we fast forward we get to
[00:35:37] Travis's first deployment and he's in alambar province and with first recon battalion and here we go
[00:35:45] as the first reconnaissance battalions maintenance management officer at camp fulusea his
[00:35:50] responsibilities which were focused on making sure vehicles were correctly allocated fuel
[00:35:55] and repaired were undoubtedly important but sitting on the sidelines while others went outside
[00:36:00] the wire to fight was definitely not what the marine had envisioned when he was back training so
[00:36:07] he got assigned as a logistics officer he did yeah he was he actually had
[00:36:15] intel officers his first choice because they have the sniper squads and he had infantry for a while
[00:36:21] and then he said you know what I think I'd like to work with a sniper so he switched it and he
[00:36:25] always thought since he switched it at the end that's how he ended up being a logistician so so he always
[00:36:33] you know was kicking himself for that but you know when he went out there started to work in
[00:36:37] logistics realize how important it was the mission I think he was still a little frustrated for sure
[00:36:44] but he started really integrate with first recon and actually Colonel Higgins the CO said look
[00:36:50] when you come back from this second tour we're gonna give you a recon battalion so he was pretty
[00:36:57] you know jazzed up about that and looking forward to to getting a recon battalion and you know
[00:37:03] it's part of why when he was over there as a mid team member he was doing the logistics
[00:37:08] as an advisor but also he was also taken the battalions out on patrols probably more than
[00:37:14] anyone over there I mean he was that's sort of the way he was I mean he was going to get ready so
[00:37:19] he was like okay another patrol I'm going yeah I got it it's I mean obviously logistics wins wars
[00:37:29] that being said I don't think Travis was a logistics kind of guy and in logistics they truly do I mean if you
[00:37:35] can't get bullets and beans you're not gonna win the war that's the way it is and that's one of the
[00:37:39] great things about the Marine Corps the way they do their spread and they put really high quality
[00:37:43] guys in every aspect of the Marine Corps including logistics but yeah I can imagine he was he was
[00:37:49] a pretty frustrated about that well frustrated and now the Marine Corps gives that an annual award
[00:37:56] to the largest edition of the year and it's the Travis Manion loader's decision of the year
[00:38:01] awards so well there you go okay that's all that's awesome you know and and Shirat Shirat
[00:38:09] is that how you pronounce his name? Oh sharet sharet okay sorry so sharet I thought this was another
[00:38:15] awesome piece of advice from from Sharet you know who you know Travis has reached out said hey you know
[00:38:21] it's it's great to be here I'm doing the best I can you know but I'm definitely getting frustrated I want
[00:38:25] to get outside the wire and Sharet says learn everything you can every second you can
[00:38:33] study the tactics study the people study the culture and know them more importantly know yourself
[00:38:40] and be vigilant not to let up on yourself preparing for the unexpected so that's just
[00:38:48] incredible advice you know and and doesn't matter what situation you're in you try and make yourself
[00:38:54] better you know and actually I work for for one of the senior seal animals that when September 11
[00:39:00] kicked off he was in charge of acquisitions at the Pentagon as a as a captain and you know
[00:39:09] here's everyone going to war and he's you know doing acquisitions which for those you
[00:39:15] don't military that means the limits of high level logistics and and something that he told
[00:39:20] me that always stuck with me was you know he was the same thing as as Travis he was frustrated
[00:39:25] he'll hear I am in the Pentagon every day and what he told me was you know what I said to myself
[00:39:30] Jochael this is my fox or I'm a fight you know so his fox holes in the Pentagon dealing with paper
[00:39:36] and that's what he did and he knew that he that was his that was what he had to do and how he's
[00:39:40] going to do it the best of his ability and and here in this from Shirat Shirat Shirat I want to
[00:39:46] get us now yeah well Jo was a great mentor you know he always had solid advice for Travis and the other
[00:39:52] guys that wrestle in maybe for sure all this being said about you know logistics being inside the
[00:40:03] wire logistics when you're running convoy's all the time those logistics guys army marine corps
[00:40:10] navy sea bees we had sea bees that ran logistics you're doing convoy's and your new
[00:40:14] convoy's do it down heavily laden i.e. deed streets so there was all kinds of logistics as a matter
[00:40:19] fact you know there's a lot of female logistics that deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan
[00:40:24] oh there's supposed to be in a non-combat role well guess what they got after they had to
[00:40:28] write in the middle of it all here in a convoy yeah so speaking that back to the book during one late
[00:40:34] night evening convoy through falusia the deafening thunder of an i.e.de shattered the relative
[00:40:39] tranquility of first reconnaissance battalion patrol the group of marine's have been attacked before
[00:40:43] but this is the first time that Travis was with them during a hostile incident keeping his
[00:40:48] composure while following orders of the more experienced officers Travis his heart pumping
[00:40:53] and ears ringing helped evacuate a marine who's wounded in the attack so again might have been
[00:41:02] in logistics but you're still those guys are out there right in the middle of it yeah exactly
[00:41:11] now he comes home from that deployment I'm going back to the book I rack changed newly promoted
[00:41:16] first lieutenant Travis minion for the better as the Marines mom dad sister and several naval
[00:41:23] academies buddies all noticed he was still the same Travis who had willingly traded doils town
[00:41:28] for one of the world's most dangerous places but after returning to the United States Travis
[00:41:34] carried with him at an aura of seriousness and quiet self confidence that was unfamiliar to some of
[00:41:40] his closest friends and loved ones when Travis talked about life he acknowledged its fragility
[00:41:47] having felt the pulse of an i.e.de blast and seen dead bodies in the streets for young marine
[00:41:54] who had just spent eight months in falusia it was almost impossible not to mature no matter what
[00:42:01] Travis was doing he was acutely aware that every single day Americans, Iraqis and Afghans were
[00:42:09] fighting and often dying I love the fact that that paragraph starts off by saying that
[00:42:22] that deployment to Iraq changed Travis for the better because so often you know we here
[00:42:29] and civilians get told and the public gets told that war does all these horrible things to people
[00:42:34] and and they fail to realize that in many cases war makes you a better person well you could
[00:42:42] you could definitely see the difference with Travis I mean he he went over there and eight
[00:42:47] months later he was a different guy I mean he was so much more focused and mature and and you know
[00:42:54] he had a chance to lead over there in these incredible situations where you have to make
[00:42:59] quick decisions and you know he he got a lot from it I could just sort of see it in the time
[00:43:06] I spent with him and the other thing about it I think is like appreciate what you have
[00:43:11] I mean I saw that so much from him you know when he was back here is just like wow
[00:43:15] this is the greatest place in the world you know there's no doubt about that that's something
[00:43:21] everybody that deploy comes back and you add a minimum you're gonna appreciate what we have in
[00:43:27] America things like bathrooms because over there you're you're only in a porta potty's right
[00:43:36] or you're in the field but you're in porta potty's in the summertime we used to call them the
[00:43:40] blue saunas because they're blue colored plastic right and then inside it's you know it's 120 degrees
[00:43:47] outside so inside the blue sauna it's you know 160 degrees and you don't want to leave the doors open
[00:43:56] because that's just nasty so you just leave the blue sauna shut yeah when you come home from that
[00:44:03] you get to a starter appreciate all things and meanwhile this time
[00:44:10] Brendan he now has gone to on a deployment to South Korea working as an Intel officer
[00:44:18] and doing that and even in doing that he felt like he had you know a lot more to do
[00:44:27] and this is when he focused on you know he wanted to be a seal but now he's going yes I need to be a seal
[00:44:34] he told his girlfriend who he had met while they were going to the Naval Academy Amy
[00:44:39] Amy I've got to do more Brendan said during a late night phone conversation
[00:44:44] Travis is there my other buddies are there and I want to be there with him
[00:44:49] when Amy reminded him of the dangers his friends like Travis were facing
[00:44:54] Brendan was undeterred I should be in the fight he insisted now there's an issue here
[00:45:01] and actually I was I talked about this how surprising it was that Brendan didn't get picked up
[00:45:07] for the seals out of the Naval Academy and I forgot the reason but there's a really distinct
[00:45:12] reason colorblind he was colorblind he was colorblind and you can't be colorblind in the
[00:45:18] seal teams at least you're not he's the first guy to get away from you're not supposed to be
[00:45:23] colorblind in the seal teams and that's why he didn't get picked up I still remember that call
[00:45:28] from Travis he said that got great news Brendan just got selected for the seals
[00:45:34] maybe seals just got one hell of a leader yeah that's that's awesome and before he got picked up
[00:45:41] and this probably helped him in you know back to the book in August 2006 Brendan deployed
[00:45:45] defluxia where he gathered and lies intelligence for combat missions including operations carried out by
[00:45:51] seals so actually I was in Ramadi at this time so Ramadi's I don't know 40 30 miles from
[00:45:56] defluxia and he was working he must have been working at our Intel shop
[00:46:04] and so the Intel he was gathering we would go out and prosecute those targets
[00:46:08] and he's working with working with seals and that that must have helped them out
[00:46:15] back to the book meanwhile Travis was making another visit to the east coast
[00:46:18] for the christening of his niece Maggie Rose so he's christening his daughter and also
[00:46:29] he found out now that he's going back to Iraq and this is another thing that he's sharing
[00:46:35] that news as the as as your granddaughters getting christened
[00:46:39] Travis is telling you hey I'm going back to Iraq and he's going back with the with the
[00:46:46] one is it the third battalion second brigade first Iraqi army division military transition team
[00:46:51] mid team I said that in the opening so little little bit about the mid teams
[00:46:59] I've talked about the various levels of comfort that you have in the military
[00:47:04] or that we had in Iraq and how you know us guys and the seal teams
[00:47:10] generally for the most part high level of comfort you know we would get to a place
[00:47:15] we would bring we would build a gym immediately we would have our CBs constructed gym if we didn't
[00:47:20] have one we would get you know we would get video or internet service we would live pretty good
[00:47:27] we'd get food ship then we would live pretty good now that being said of course there was
[00:47:32] a special ops guys that were way out the middle nowhere living on a fobs somewhere and that's
[00:47:37] living rough there were some people that were even more comfortable there were some headquarters units
[00:47:45] that had swimming pools I'm gonna say that again swimming pools so there's some headquarters
[00:47:51] areas you know if you got into the green zone and Baghdad you're yeah I'm on to pull him in
[00:47:55] Iraq I'm gonna head out to the swimming pool for a few minutes you know there's there's the there's
[00:47:59] those kind of living and then you get you know you got in in Ramadi we had the conventional guys
[00:48:04] that were living in the combat outposts in the city real rough living and then you go one step
[00:48:12] rougher and where you end up with his mid teams and mid teams so the the the stands for military
[00:48:19] transition team and this is when you are the direct advisor to an Iraqi battalion and in this
[00:48:31] case it was the three two one you're gonna hear me said about it's the third battalion second
[00:48:35] brigade first Iraqi army division so this is this is a battalion of Iraqi soldiers supposed to be
[00:48:43] six or seven hundred probably a lot less than that because they were generally highly undermanned
[00:48:49] but the mid teams had a really really hard job or an incredibly hard job it was you know we
[00:48:56] did advising to the Iraqi soldiers and we work with the Iraqi soldiers side by side and
[00:49:01] these guys did it not just on the battlefield but with everything that they did helping them with
[00:49:05] their pay helping them learn how to how to do the logistics side that you mentioned Travis was doing
[00:49:10] the mid teams just nothing but respect for the mid teams and on top of that we go out with the
[00:49:16] sealed teams you know we had great training and then we had other seals with us mid team we'd
[00:49:21] have we'd have a minimum usually of like six to eight seals with us and we got mid teams sometimes
[00:49:25] those guys are going out with one other mid team guy out with forty Iraqi soldiers
[00:49:32] poorly trained poorly motivated yeah they they lived right there with them yeah and they were
[00:49:37] totally embedded with them so yeah eating the same food tough job yeah horror I remember that
[00:49:45] the the call from Travis when it first heard that and I was just like wow you know much more
[00:49:50] comfortable as a dad with Travis with 200 Marines yeah the comfort levels the comfort levels
[00:49:55] incomparable yeah between being with 200 Marines and being with 200 Iraqis it's is completely
[00:50:02] it's the level of risk is so much higher there was a when there was a mid team that came out
[00:50:08] in a Romadi and they were turning over to mid team the ongoing mid leader and the off-going
[00:50:14] mid leader returned over they got attacked both of them got killed one attack that that's how much
[00:50:18] risk they're they're taking with these these mid team situations well the other thing about these
[00:50:23] guys is you know they were they were going out and in patrols with them and you know if they're
[00:50:29] going to train them the right way they were out front me one of the things with Travis last time I
[00:50:36] talked to him one of the last times at home I said Travis you're an advisor make sure you just
[00:50:41] tell the Iraqis what needs to be done and step back and let them execute and there's like okay
[00:50:46] that I got it and I knew I knew exactly you know what he was going to do he was going to lead
[00:50:52] from the front and that that's what he did you know that's what all those guys were doing they were
[00:50:56] you're you're out of patrol you're right out front with everyone else you know when the navy
[00:51:02] seals came back uh Erick Gratins was a navy seal with Travis and he said you know Travis was always
[00:51:09] there every patrol so yeah so that's what he gets tasked with and and I'll tell you what if you want
[00:51:22] to get some here in a mid team you know like you said you know you're going to go out patrols
[00:51:26] of the Iraqis you know you're going to have to there's no doubt about it's nothing but respect for
[00:51:30] the guys and we work with a bunch of mid teams in a body just outstanding guys doing a really
[00:51:36] really hard job yeah tough tough job well you know at the end of the day was strategically
[00:51:42] it was the the search right and they put everything behind the mid teams at that point you remember
[00:51:48] in 2006 2007 before Travis left he actually had a chance to talk to General Mattis came and talked to
[00:51:54] his mid team about how important that mission was so we're putting a lot behind our guys that were
[00:52:01] embedded with the Iraqis yeah and again for those of you that just a day into this strategic piece a
[00:52:06] little bit more our goal was to turn over Iraqis security to the Iraqis and and the only way to do
[00:52:15] that and we realize that's enough one of the things that made people realize the importance of the
[00:52:19] mid teams was you weren't going to do it you weren't going to educate them on how to do a combat
[00:52:24] patrol in the classroom you weren't going to educate them on how to do a combat patrol even
[00:52:29] on a training field you needed to take them out and teach them and and force them to go out
[00:52:37] into these things because the Iraqis if they have the the the the the opportunity to either stay on
[00:52:43] base or go out on patrol a lot of them would do it yeah they're there goal is to stay on base many
[00:52:49] of them and so of course there were some guys that were more motivated but a lot of them were just
[00:52:55] they just want to survive right they just want to survive so strategically that's what we had to
[00:53:00] do is we had to take them out and give them all the job training and simultaneously push them
[00:53:06] to to go out and try and lower some of the level of violence out in the various cities so
[00:53:14] yeah at this time also as you mentioned Brendan got approved for his for his lat transfers
[00:53:22] called a lat transfer and so now he knows that he's going to he knows that he's going to
[00:53:29] go to but's go to but's and and and be a seal or at least trying be a seal but I bet he was pretty
[00:53:34] confident yeah I'm certain of that one of the first things Travis did here he's he's going he's got
[00:53:43] a couple more days left he meets up with marine major Steve Cantrell and assistant navy
[00:53:50] wrestling coach and they go to New York Travis and Cantrell decide to spend a few days in New York
[00:53:56] city where Cantrell had arranged a visit to New York fire departments rescue one headquarters
[00:54:01] located in Hell's Kitchen rescue one had become a revered place over the past five years
[00:54:07] the small Manhattan building which was still fully functioning had been the home base for 11
[00:54:13] firefighters almost half the unit who were killed in the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks
[00:54:21] as they were leaving the firehouse one firefighter in former marine thank Travis for coming out
[00:54:26] Lieutenant Manion I want you to have these hats and shirts said the Marine Corps veteran
[00:54:31] no matter how crazy things get over there you can always put one of these on
[00:54:38] and remember what you're fighting for and he comes home and he's got that
[00:54:46] that rescue one hat with the with the rescue one fire department New York logo on the front
[00:54:53] and night 1101 never forget on the back
[00:54:58] then he says to you dad I want you to have this and please wear it while I'm gone no matter what
[00:55:04] happens always remember that this is what we're fighting for
[00:55:08] yeah I always remember that that discussion we had you know down the hallway
[00:55:14] and so impacted him to be there with those guys and he actually went up there to thank them
[00:55:19] for all they had done and he said dad they couldn't thank me enough for for my tour and
[00:55:25] what I was about to do and he was you know he he got real serious about it you know as
[00:55:32] remember that was one of the last conversations I had with him interesting side note to that story
[00:55:38] so my wife and I after we lost Travis went up to rescue one talk to the guys we were up there
[00:55:44] and they sort of remember maybe you know somebody coming through and but it never really clicked
[00:55:52] for the guys who were with but great guys and you know we end up leaving and never felt like
[00:55:57] we had the connection that we expected because Travis had talked about it so much and a couple
[00:56:03] years later I say about two years ago so what are you talking about like 7-6-7 years later
[00:56:12] well the books out and there's a New York City firefighter that gives his buddy the book and says
[00:56:17] hey read this book said mentions rescue one so the guys on the treadmill he almost falls off the
[00:56:23] treadmill says that that was me he had since been transferred so Tim Sullivan calls me up and says
[00:56:29] I'm the guy in the book I want to come up a beer with you yeah that's outstanding and that's also
[00:56:39] the same conversation where you told Travis you know hey you're an advisor advise and let the
[00:56:47] Iraq is execute which can be really hard it's you know can be hard because they won't execute
[00:56:53] it can be hard because you want to show them how to do it right and oftentimes if you don't
[00:56:58] lead from the front not gonna happen so I'm gonna have them there no so now your son and all Dave
[00:57:10] and Travis go to a football game and here we go back to the book as they reach a flight of stairs
[00:57:17] near the Lincoln Financial Field exit Dave with a clear hint of humor finally conveyed his
[00:57:23] concerns he was concerned you know he's concerned about him going overseas and he's just hey
[00:57:27] Travis I trip you right now and you fell down and broke your ankle do you think they let you
[00:57:31] sit this deployment out he asked Travis chuckle the Dave's joke but didn't say much in response
[00:57:38] a brief moment of slightly awkward silence followed while drunk and eagles fans shouted and
[00:57:44] chanted all around them suddenly Travis spoke up you know what though Dave Travis said with an
[00:57:53] honest day could we serious look on his face if I don't go they're gonna send another marina my
[00:57:59] place who doesn't have my training if not me Ben who you know what I mean he continued it's
[00:58:09] either me or that other guy who isn't ready so I'm the one who has to get the job done
[00:58:20] so think about that because you know you think back to the the time with coach Sharon
[00:58:25] and Brian stand and then they're in the plane and Travis says I want to be known as the guy that
[00:58:31] always you know step forward and did what was right if not me then who is another way to say it right
[00:58:40] and it's you know it's not I don't share that because it's unique to Travis you know I
[00:58:45] share that because it's and this whole story is really a representation is so many men and women
[00:58:51] in uniform you know it's their story but it's a story that can be told about so many
[00:58:57] and that if not me then who you know we we use that now at the foundation it's sort of drive
[00:59:05] momentum around you know what we all need to be thinking about as Americans stepping up and doing the
[00:59:10] right thing you know I'll agree with you 100% that there's a lot of people that say things like that
[00:59:17] but you know to have an example that someone that's so clearly live that is awesome to look at.
[00:59:27] Now we're getting ready for deployment back to the book more than 100 American troops were
[00:59:32] killed in Iraq in December 2006 including Major Megan McClung the highest ranking female officer
[00:59:39] to die in Iraq war in the Iraq war and the first female naval academy graduate to be killed in combat
[00:59:50] by the way that she was stationed in Ramadi I knew her and she was killed along with a
[00:59:58] another army specialist named Vincent Pumante their killed by big ID on routes sunset I think it was
[01:00:07] and also another guy was with her her guy named Travis Patrickwin who was just an unbelievable guy
[01:00:18] and this was a huge loss to lose to lose Travis and Megan in that ID
[01:00:29] any both of them and it was just just a huge loss never never knew her but I certainly meant her parents
[01:00:36] you know she's buried down in on in 10 sections 60 she was she was just like really
[01:00:45] just a huge smile all the time a real go get her just making things happen I didn't work with
[01:00:50] her you know I mean we'd see I'd see her at brigade meetings because we were both you know
[01:00:53] working with the one one AD and you know she was just yeah I got that and she was just really positive
[01:01:00] and and she was the thing I remember most about her was just her smiling you know she just
[01:01:05] always had a big smile on her face and and and Travis you know and I'm gonna do Travis story on
[01:01:11] here some day you know Travis was the guy he made this this PowerPoint brief for how to win the
[01:01:17] war in Iraq and it was stick figures and it explained like hey here's you you're an American here's
[01:01:23] this Iraqi and you don't know if this Iraq is good or bad but you know who does know these other
[01:01:28] Iraqis and it was just all these stick figures and it got published it got circulated that was
[01:01:33] Travis that was Travis Patrick and he spoke Arabic just a fantastic guy and I'll definitely
[01:01:38] cover there's that there was a book written about him as well so incredible people on on her
[01:01:47] at her grave site in section 60 it says be bold be brief be gone well she was indeed all those three things
[01:01:55] yeah going on here now major dug Zembeck the Naval Academy wrestler turned warrior whom
[01:02:06] Travis admired he was killed as well yeah there was shortly after we lost Travis a couple weeks
[01:02:16] later dug was over there and bagged in was killed yeah okay he was he I don't know if you knew him
[01:02:27] I didn't it's kind of a big personality at the Naval Academy and had the Marines in
[01:02:33] Foulouja yeah came back into the plane of Foulouja yeah yeah quite quite a leader and I really didn't
[01:02:40] know me there and Travis his junior year he was back wrestling with Travis at Navy they were
[01:02:47] about the same size dug was a big guy and and it's a guy behind the bench yelling and screaming
[01:02:54] like crazy as Travis is out there wrestling had a really tough match he ends up winning like
[01:02:59] one nothing against this kid from North Carolina I said Travis who is that guy behind the bench
[01:03:05] said that that's dug Zembeck you know who dug Zembeck so yeah that's when I first ended up at this point
[01:03:11] he hadn't been killed yet he was he was but the point that they were making here that I I kind of
[01:03:18] misworded was that he was a classmate of of Megamoclons apparently so that was the connection there
[01:03:28] yeah that was a couple that was what a couple weeks a couple weeks before before Travis arrives
[01:03:37] that you know he's getting this news yeah now Travis is back in Foulouja back to the book
[01:03:46] Travis had seen his share of blood but never needed to wash any from his hands that all
[01:03:50] chained and changed and January less than a month after he turned to Foulouja for his second
[01:03:55] deployment Travis and his fellow mid members went on combat patrols virtually every day
[01:04:04] sometimes running as many as three missions over punishing 18 hour span in Foulouja throughout
[01:04:10] Iraq marine soldiers sailors airmen and Iraqi troops did everything from hunting
[01:04:14] insurgents and weapons caches to disposing of dead bodies adding to three two one
[01:04:20] mitts challenges were joint patrols with the Iraqis through some of Foulouja's most dangerous sectors
[01:04:26] the Iraqi soldiers would sometimes respond to the slightest sign of violence with what some
[01:04:31] us team members nicknamed the Iraqi death blossom when a shot was fired in their direction the
[01:04:37] Iraqis would sometimes form a circle and fire in every direction with little regard for consequences
[01:04:42] including tragically catching innocent civilians in a crossfire civilian casualties were
[01:04:48] sometimes unavoidable reality of war but Travis and his fellow Marines were determined to use
[01:04:54] every means at their disposal to prevent them. While some mitt team members
[01:05:01] understandably became frustrated with the often untrained underpaid Iraqi soldiers
[01:05:07] Travis positioned himself as a mentor during lunch he would bring his child to their
[01:05:13] mess hall and sit with nick and Iraqi translator who helped bridge the gap between US and Iraqi
[01:05:19] armies they not only talked about combat strategy but also simple things like soccer
[01:05:28] so this is just pure professionalism that's what that is pure professionalism.
[01:05:32] I had a chance to go over to Iraq in 2010 and I met with the Iraqis that Travis served with
[01:05:37] and they said that Lieutenant Manu would always come over and sit down and eat with us and talk
[01:05:46] with us and it was part of what you needed to do right if you're going to be there and be
[01:05:52] there brother and help them with the mission they had you got to be part of what they're doing
[01:05:58] and he understood that I mean it's not like unlike Brennan would you know I mean when
[01:06:05] you're playing athletics you sort of get that teamwork piece you know you know if you're
[01:06:09] going to make it work you got to all be together. Yeah and it's the book makes it sound like
[01:06:16] fairly easy to do that it's not man it's hard there's a huge cultural difference between
[01:06:22] Iraqis and American and you know it's not that big of a deal but I'll tell you what going you know
[01:06:31] your your overseas the one time you can kind of relax when you get to sit down and eat your
[01:06:35] child and you're in the childhood and you're actually fairly well protected most of the time you don't
[01:06:39] have to worry about anything you you clear your weapon before you go in the childhood I mean it's
[01:06:44] it's usually a relatively safe place and you get to relax you get to be around all your
[01:06:48] American friends and it's good to to deny yourself that and now you're going into because you know
[01:06:54] at this time you don't you you can't give full trust to the Iraqis you're you're going to you know
[01:07:01] eating with them the conversations are still did it's just not this little thing it's a big deal
[01:07:08] it's it's it's it's a it's a big deal to make that extra effort and and clearly you know
[01:07:14] many times you know I'm I'm pretty engaged in my job you know many times I ate with Iraqis
[01:07:18] when I was in Iraq in my last appointment maybe twice maybe twice yeah maybe twice you know
[01:07:29] because you know when I was in a little bit I was in a different position but maybe twice yeah and
[01:07:35] you know at the end of the day they recognized that oh first when I went over they talked about that
[01:07:40] quite a bit with me and how they recognized that and how it was important to them and he knew that
[01:07:46] he absolutely did that's the point is that he he knew it he knew that making that sacrifice building
[01:07:52] those relationships that was his primary mission or at least one of his primary missions was to build
[01:07:58] relationships with these Iraqi soldiers so that they could get to know them so they could build trust
[01:08:03] and so that they would go out there and do their job so professional at all times and this is another
[01:08:09] really good example of of Travis Travis's leadership back to the book just as some US
[01:08:15] Marines became frustrated by the raw battlefield tactics of the Iraqis which could put all their
[01:08:21] lives at risks some Iraqi soldiers rolled their eyes when Americans gave them orders whereas previous
[01:08:28] Marine lieutenants had barked instructions that they Iraqi army leadership Travis took a different approach
[01:08:35] starting with a knock on the door of the Iraqi lieutenant Jallal good day lieutenant I was wondering
[01:08:42] if I could speak with you about the upcoming raid on the high value target in the industrial sector
[01:08:47] Travis said through the interpreter I was wondering what time you think you would like to execute
[01:08:53] our mission I think five PM would be a good time to leave Jallal replied my men had a long day
[01:09:00] and I don't want to keep them up too late okay Travis said but I'm wondering if you might consider
[01:09:05] leaving a bit later possibly after sunset my concern is that our presence during daylight could
[01:09:11] endanger neighbors who live near the house we're gonna strike not to mention little children
[01:09:16] who could be playing in the street respectfully lieutenant I wouldn't want to be the one to tell
[01:09:21] their parents that their son or daughter might still be alive if we had waited a couple more hours
[01:09:28] after a pause in a sip of water the Iraqi officer nodded the raid would not start until 8 PM
[01:09:36] so again real leadership and I talk about this all the time in here you know the real leaders
[01:09:42] aren't barking orders the real leaders are the ones that are flanking and using indirect approaches
[01:09:48] sure with the people that they're trying to influence and there's just a phenomenal example of that
[01:09:53] got some email here email coming from Travis sent it to you you know sent it to the family
[01:10:07] and and some of his buddies sent to bring in as well here we go all my job is definitely going well
[01:10:14] after all the horror stories we hear we heard about the Iraqi armoured army and their unwillingness
[01:10:19] to work with the myths they have been very open and willing to listen to advice creating an initial
[01:10:27] relationship with my counterparts was the right move and it has allowed me to help them start shaping
[01:10:33] operations there are many dedicated men in this army and it's been an eye opening experience so far
[01:10:40] the best IAs that's Iraqi army soldier the best IAs are definitely dedicated to their cause and
[01:10:46] have a warrior mentality that rivals some Americans however there are still those enemies out there
[01:10:53] that wish us to fail there's a lot of work left to do but the city is definitely at a different place
[01:10:59] that it was last year I really feel that is it is at a critical point where if the present situation
[01:11:06] continues to progress it could have huge positive impact in other areas also I found a good balance
[01:11:13] between my logistics job and my company advisor role although going on operations definitely requires
[01:11:19] a good amount of time I'm able to work with the batalion logistics officer on a fairly regular basis
[01:11:26] I also appreciate all the good food and gear that has been sent workouts and your support have
[01:11:32] definitely helped keep me going as I said before we're pretty busy if I wanted to take a
[01:11:38] minute to thank you guys for everything and keep you updated please continue to write and
[01:11:43] enjoy your updates as well take care and I'll talk to you soon to simplify Travis
[01:11:50] yeah I was one of his last notes home but you can see I mean he's a glass half full type of guy you know
[01:11:57] we're getting it done we're working hard we're going to make a difference you know that's
[01:12:01] sort of how he approached everything and that was what he was trying to share interesting thing also
[01:12:08] about the logistics role because when I was over there talking to the logistics guy that he
[01:12:14] worked with sort of in a kidding way he said you know lieutenant man he was a horrible logistics
[01:12:19] officer and they started laughing he said he's never he was always on patrol he was never there
[01:12:25] with us when we had to do logistics stuff so that's I guess that's expected
[01:12:37] now we're going back to the book the next morning Travis and his teammates are woke around 530 a
[01:12:43] m to a huge explosion a few minutes later they learned that observation post back dad a new
[01:12:49] makeshift base they had been working to set up in flusha was a pile of rubble they'd go to that
[01:12:55] location with gunfire initially surrounding them before a secure permanent was established
[01:13:00] Travis albino my saying that right albino albino and others spent the next eight hours
[01:13:07] entering and re-enering the rubble while their team members controlled the crowd outside
[01:13:12] for all they knew the rest of the bombed out complex could have crumbled or there could have been
[01:13:16] other bombs tied time to go off when the quick reaction forced arrived they went into the ruins
[01:13:22] anyway carrying a large flashlight Travis crawled into the rubble sweating profusely due to the heat
[01:13:29] which is exact exacerbated by small fires burning throughout the compound Travis dug through dirt sand
[01:13:36] and remnants of brick searching for trapped arackies Travis albino and their teammates recovered
[01:13:43] two injured irackies and two dead bodies from the attack site their selfless actions
[01:13:49] had an enduring impact on many of the irackies who bore witness so you know this is even in
[01:13:55] America when there's something when a bomb when a building is collapsing they don't you know
[01:13:59] it's really really risky to go in there and Travis is like no we're going in there might be survivors
[01:14:05] iracky civilians he has no idea or maybe they were military guys he has no idea he's no
[01:14:08] I need to know them he's gonna risk his life just to go and help them back to the book less than
[01:14:16] 24 hours later Travis's ears were ringing after an IED blew up underneath his vehicle the blast
[01:14:23] jarring pounding force loudly and abruptly halted his vehicles patrol through the city's volatile
[01:14:29] eastern industrial sector Travis had encountered IED's during his first deployment and is recently
[01:14:35] as nine days earlier after ensuring that fellow Americans and irackies were uningered Travis looked
[01:14:42] down at the sandy street where the crude explosive device was buried see that wire Travis said to
[01:14:48] another Iraqi lieutenant that's a command wire and it's stretching towards that building
[01:14:54] gathered your men and follow me he said to the Iraqi before turning to his Marines you and the
[01:14:58] other guys cover us just in case there's snipers lieutenant why don't we just leave the Iraqi said
[01:15:06] to Travis because they'll keep planning bombs around here and kill more of my men more of your
[01:15:12] men and probably kill some kids Travis said so respectfully lieutenant I'm going over there to find
[01:15:18] out who's responsible with or without you after a brief pause the Iraqi lieutenant got three of
[01:15:24] his men and followed Travis as he traced the command wires origin rounding a corner Travis saw
[01:15:29] man in civilian clothes kneeling over what appeared to be a pile of grenades which along with
[01:15:35] the attached wires appeared to be some sort of booby trap without hesitation Travis squared up to
[01:15:40] confront the threat the Marines out on the street heard the pop of Travis's M203 grenade launcher
[01:15:47] and the subsequent explosion several ran toward the sound while others stayed to keep watch over
[01:15:53] the exterior the tall sweaty insurgent took off running now being chased by a fearless determined
[01:15:59] Marine Travis had the bad guy in his sights and he wasn't going to let him get away stop Travis
[01:16:05] shouted an Arabic while pursuing the suspect by the time the US and Iraqi reinforcements arrived
[01:16:12] Travis was dragging the frightened suspect down off a wall he had tried to scale and an unsuccessful
[01:16:17] attempt unsuccessful attempt to escape after body slamming him to the ground Travis put the
[01:16:23] insurgents hands behind his back then made sure he was taken in for questioning the suspect
[01:16:30] eventually led the mid team to a room not far from the booby trap which contained grenades and many
[01:16:35] more bomb making materials without losing any lives or ruffling more feathers in the Sunni onklave
[01:16:42] Travis had helped remove deadly weapons and another terrorist from Felus' streets
[01:16:51] yeah so when I heard that story when it was shared with me one of the other parts of it is that
[01:16:59] when Travis ended up catching this guy put a I guess a good rest of the move on put him down to ground
[01:17:06] the Iraqis actually wanted to take this guy out you know and he's like no you're not doing that
[01:17:11] okay we're taking him back you know and they figured we'll just take care of this guy right here right now
[01:17:18] yeah and they just he just got Travis got just got hit with an IED by the way
[01:17:25] it must have gone low order which means it must not have detonated properly
[01:17:29] because if you're in a humveen you can hit with a legitimate IED it hit your vehicle under your vehicle
[01:17:34] your chances to survival isn't great and and so to have this guy actually hit you with an IED that you're
[01:17:41] lucky enough to survive and then you catch him and then you know I bet you that I'm going to
[01:17:48] we could I wish we could find out if the if the Iraqis that saw this if we could find out what
[01:17:53] wrestling move here used to put this insurance on his back thinking superex. Yeah superex yeah
[01:17:58] hey you had a good headlock yeah I bet that was not a happy insertion at that point but you know
[01:18:06] this also the other thing I was good about this is it shows you how Travis had to lead from the front
[01:18:11] because like I said the Iraqis are just content to say hey let's just go back to base you know
[01:18:17] let's just leave that's that's very common for them and Travis has to lead from the front has to
[01:18:24] say no we're gonna stay you can stay here but I'm gonna go get these guys and you know kind of
[01:18:28] shame them and help them out yeah you know and he was doing that but he was also seeing that
[01:18:35] the result of that was progress that these guys were starting to take on more and more and that was
[01:18:41] important to even just the fact that they followed it you know but that's that's what they're doing
[01:18:45] and then what they do is they gain confidence and they say yeah you know we can do this too and and that's
[01:18:49] how you eventually turn over battle space to them yeah going back to the book half of world away in
[01:18:56] California Brendan was about to embark on his most difficult challenge since 9-11, Buds training
[01:19:06] so you know I just wanted to point out that while Travis is now back in Flusia
[01:19:12] Brendan has got his orders and he shows up at Buds and you know he trained super hard to get ready for it
[01:19:17] and and there we go
[01:19:19] while helping turn the tide in Flusia first lieutenant Travis manion wrote a letter to the
[01:19:26] intelligenceer one of his hometown newspapers in Bucks County Pennsylvania and here's that letter
[01:19:34] there are many views on our mission here however all I can say with certainty is that there are
[01:19:40] thousands of Americans over here working hard towards a positive outcome in Iraq
[01:19:45] every day I'm here I see great things being accomplished under harsh circumstances from young Americans
[01:19:52] I'm truly honored to serve the side these marine sailors soldiers in airmen
[01:19:58] I'm not sure the average American sees the positives these service men and women accomplish
[01:20:03] or even understands the sacrifices of their efforts however whatever course of action our leadership
[01:20:09] decides upon there are those in waiting ready to carry out the mission in support of our country
[01:20:16] and in defense of its people and their freedoms
[01:20:21] respectfully Travis manion first lieutenant united states marine corps
[01:20:28] yeah that sums sums it up totally for him I mean you know you always knew where Travis was coming from
[01:20:34] very straightforward and and I mean obviously I agree with him that's that's a lot of people don't
[01:20:41] understand and still don't a lot of people still don't understand the the positive things that
[01:20:47] were occurring over in Iraq the positive things the the simple
[01:20:52] haven't lunch with them the simple trying to prevent collateral damage you know that's been
[01:20:58] mentioned several times you know the Iraqi soldiers they get content somebody shoots at them they shoot
[01:21:03] 360 degrees they don't care where it hits and they're doing everything they can to train them
[01:21:07] and and put some discipline on them so that they don't hurt those civilians so
[01:21:13] and the willingness you know you guys tell us what to do you guys give us give us the mission
[01:21:18] and we're standing here and we'll get it in the distance yeah yep so now we're looking at
[01:21:25] a mission in an area of fluja which is called the pizza slice and if you go look at a map of
[01:21:34] fluja it's really obvious to figure out where the pizza slice is I did I did actually
[01:21:38] did one operation my first deployment to Iraq in the pizza slice and they're looking at doing
[01:21:43] an operation there they got some intelligence that there's a bad guy there that they want to go
[01:21:48] and get and we're going back to the book after discussing the idea with several fellow officers
[01:21:54] including Travis major Kubicki let's say that right Kubicki yeah major Kubicki announced that a team
[01:22:01] would head into the pizza slice to follow up on new intelligence about the snipers where about so
[01:22:06] it's a sniper that they're going after an enemy sniper hopefully they could find the terrorist sniper
[01:22:14] who is shooting at US Marines Iraqi soldiers and civilians to American humvies would accompany
[01:22:19] two full vehicles of Iraqi army troops in one home v would be Kubicki albino and Kim
[01:22:29] they would be joined by the driver staff sergeant Paul Petty and the turret gunner
[01:22:35] staff sergeant Josh Wilson meringue and sagal seagull meringue and seagull seagull
[01:22:42] would ride in the second home v the driver would be staff sergeant Chad Marquette
[01:22:50] turret gunner corporal briner and Muhammad and Iraqi interpreter Travis and second lieutenant
[01:22:59] Scott Alexander a friend and fellow mid team member were supposed to go to a nearby school with
[01:23:05] Iraqi soldiers and hand out candy crans and coloring books to local kids Travis was excited about
[01:23:12] the mission because he cared about the Iraqis and loved to see the smiles on the faces of the
[01:23:16] kids so they got two operations that they're about to execute one of them is to go and hunt down
[01:23:22] this sniper and the other one is to go do some build some wind some hearts and minds hand it out
[01:23:27] candy the kids now Kim is one of the other nitt team officers he's the ops the ops officer
[01:23:36] that's that's who Kim is and we're going back to the book Kim who had smelled the ugly
[01:23:41] niss in the air when he woke up that morning had and had reed reed reed reed it his unneasiness
[01:23:47] just minutes earlier told Travis at the smiles of Iraqi school children would be a welcome site
[01:23:53] Kim was a brave marine who repeatedly distinguished himself on the battlefield but on this day
[01:23:58] he felt worn down fortunately he and Travis were close enough that he felt confident asking
[01:24:05] his friend to take his place on major kubikis pizza slice patrol team is it cool if I had over
[01:24:13] the school instead Kim asked no problem Travis replied his eyes lighting up because he knew
[01:24:20] this man he could help go find the sniper are you sure Kim insisted go ahead with Scott to the
[01:24:26] school Travis said we're all good thanks Travis Kim said I'll see you in a bit see you back here
[01:24:33] Travis said with a nod yes so never knew that story and when right in the book
[01:24:40] started to talk to Chris about that day and you know he said hey I've got something I want to share
[01:24:46] did I never has shared before and he mentioned that you know it was supposed to be meal in that
[01:24:50] patrol as you would take for him this would have come forward with that story but he and in
[01:24:57] Travis and Scott were really close and I know it had to be bothering him for a while and he
[01:25:03] he shared that so so they roll into the pizza slice which again this is just a dude's a picture in
[01:25:16] your mind what it looks like it's kind of your stereotypical combat Iraq city small narrow streets
[01:25:24] you know trash in the streets buildings really close together threats everywhere dirty run down
[01:25:32] wires everywhere it's just a it's kind of your stereotypical Iraqi combat city that's exactly what
[01:25:41] what it is in the pizza slice in Fouloujia they're in their perimeter and boom here we go to the
[01:25:48] book the enemy sniper pulled the trigger blasting what felt like a metal pipe throughout
[01:25:53] Bino's lower left album abdomen the bullet which ricochet off the corpsman's radio
[01:25:58] then tore through his left lung how Bino fell to his knees dropping his weapon and landing
[01:26:04] flat on his face in the sword trash filled streets mother fucker yelled petty who had gotten a thumbs
[01:26:11] up from the dock a split second before in an instant Travis and Kubicki started running toward
[01:26:17] the wounded corpsman casualty scream the court deterret gunner of the other American home v he was
[01:26:23] the only one in the vehicle that to see Albino go down everyone in the home v froze
[01:26:30] Iraqi a stun meringue yelled out response despite the sudden jolt of adrenaline their heart sank
[01:26:37] when they heard the gunners response it's dock he yelled opening fire ambush
[01:26:44] Travis reacted as soon as the first shot rang out he took off running towards wounded
[01:26:49] comrade as the thunder sound of American turret gunfire rang out the once quiet alleyway
[01:26:55] even with the enemy shooting above from above Travis didn't care about his own safety
[01:27:00] he knew he this could be his only chance to save dock
[01:27:05] at the other American home v rang and seagull also took off in Albino's direction
[01:27:11] though they were trained to never run towards a sniper's victim the warrior ethos have never
[01:27:17] leaving a fallen comrade behind had overridden their sensibilities
[01:27:22] Travis who reached dock first grabbed him by the left shoulder and Kubicki
[01:27:27] who was running close behind clutched Albino's right arm a few seconds later
[01:27:32] come on dock Travis yelled as he as he in the major pulled Albino closer to the home v
[01:27:38] bullets were now raining down from multiple rooftops which meant that more
[01:27:44] insurgents had been waiting with the sniper to ambush the American Iraqi and Iraqi troops
[01:27:50] the mid team was encircled by insurgents and without a fierce counter intact the entire patrol
[01:27:56] was almost certainly doomed as bedlim ensued the marines realized that both Iraqi vehicles in
[01:28:05] their patrol were gone after the Iraqi soldiers heard the gunfire the front vehicle subsequently hit
[01:28:12] an i.e. while trying to loop around towards a better fighting position the Iraqis were stranded
[01:28:18] which meant nine Americans and their interpreter were left outnumbered in a confined chaotic space
[01:28:25] yeah so you know with Travis that day you know he helped pull dock in docks said when I
[01:28:38] went to see dock at the but as the hospital he said you know I just felt this this big hand
[01:28:44] coming and grabbed me and pulled me in and they were surrounded there and you know with the
[01:28:51] sniper was there firing away I don't know if you're going to share but Chuck Segal was also wounded
[01:28:59] as he came in actually got an email from Chuck recently just to you know so many years later
[01:29:07] just to sort of talk about that day and what it was all about but you can imagine that the
[01:29:14] the cloud of war chaos confusion nobody really knows what's going on
[01:29:19] as I talked to the guys that were there that day nobody was really sure where things were
[01:29:25] coming from they just knew they were in big trouble yeah that's one of the hardest things about
[01:29:30] the urban environment it happened in all environments but in the urban environment you hear shots
[01:29:35] coming in you don't know where they're coming from it's very difficult to tell because the sound
[01:29:39] reflects and refracts off the different buildings and you know the sniper or the the shooters can
[01:29:44] be one or two rooms deep you just don't know where the where the rounds are coming from and it's
[01:29:51] just very very confusing a lot of confusion from from all the guys I spoke with
[01:30:00] going back to the book here Travis and Kubicki dragged Albino out of the kilzone
[01:30:05] and closer to the vehicles front side where the sniper couldn't deliver a fatal blow to their
[01:30:09] bleeding gasping corpsmen as they tended to Albino's wounds Travis saw meringue and Seagull
[01:30:16] running toward him at full speed another piercing crack of gunfire abruptly echoed through the alley
[01:30:24] in an instant Seagull was somersaulting in midair feeling like Mike Tyson had just punched him in the
[01:30:30] stomach and landing in the middle of the bullet riddled street all around Seagull who broke his rifle
[01:30:37] wall collapsing the ground a hectic battle was unfolding in an eerie slow motion silence
[01:30:45] Seagull's wrist convulsed with tremendous pain the sniper was firing at the wounded marina's
[01:30:49] delay in the street and the young lads corporal who had just been shot in the wrist and still
[01:30:54] unbeknownst to him also in the stomach would soon be dead if he didn't get in front of that home v
[01:31:00] as Seagull laid powerless unable to do anything but wait for the crushing blow of another sniper bullet
[01:31:06] Travis pulled him out of the sniper's crosshairs moments later Seagull laid next to Albino
[01:31:14] who was still being worked on by Kubicki so again you know if you got a sniper scenario
[01:31:23] and there's a guy down the last thing you want to do is run over to try and help get him out of that
[01:31:30] situation unless you're Travis and then that's the first thing you're going to do.
[01:31:39] By the time the confused lands corporal looked up into the dust Travis was gone he'd already run
[01:31:46] back into a cloud of bullets Travis dashed across the street not far from where Seagull had been hit
[01:31:52] twice in meringue had barely escaped death without blinking he blasted her grenade onto the
[01:31:58] one of the rooftops buildings sending chunks of concrete tunneling of ground.
[01:32:02] When Travis switched to M4 rounds his suppressing fire was equally relentless which gave Kubicki
[01:32:08] and meringue enough time to help ballooned it. With one rooftop silent after stunned
[01:32:13] insurgents had experienced the crushing power of Travis's grenades and countless M4 rounds
[01:32:18] the battles tied begin to turn. Seagull and Albino couldn't see Travis firing but they could
[01:32:24] hear the welcome sounds of the American counter attack which only paused when Travis needed to reload.
[01:32:33] Go! Travis screamed to his fellow officers who moved into new positions so they could join him in the
[01:32:38] fire in firing at the enemy. Travis moving east in the alleyway from the homevee's
[01:32:43] pastor side to the driver side as he blasted away at another rooftop was now causing the same kind of
[01:32:49] pandemonium among the enemy that the sniper had initially brought on the Americans. Justin front of
[01:32:54] Seagull, the corpsman initially pulled to safety by Travis and Kubicki dragged himself
[01:33:00] almost completely under the vehicle with only his legs sticking out. Desperately trying to breathe
[01:33:05] while tasting a mixture of sand and his own blood Albino was almost certain he was going to die.
[01:33:12] A middysiness, extreme thirst and the crashing sounds of concrete, the wounded corpsman pictured
[01:33:18] his mother when he didn't want to suffer in the wake of his death. But at the same time Albino
[01:33:25] could see Travis boots, Travis's boots firmly planted in the sand while he fired at enemy positions.
[01:33:32] The situation was bleak but maybe there was still a chance to survive.
[01:33:39] So you got Travis, it's interesting they use the word counter attack.
[01:33:44] And usually when you think of a counter attack you think of a platoon or at least a squad
[01:33:51] that's maneuvering to counter attack an enemy. And in this situation we got a one man counter attack
[01:33:58] that's the initiative. This Travis stepping up, putting down suppressive fire, putting down grenade fire,
[01:34:06] exposing himself to the enemy to make that happen.
[01:34:08] Well, trying to build them will manage the other way because the momentum is coming in.
[01:34:15] So much so on the other side that you got to sort of get out and get it on them, get the rounds on
[01:34:23] them to have them lose that momentum. Yeah and just like any military unit, the insurgents,
[01:34:31] if they have the upper hand they're going to press but the minute you can press them back and
[01:34:35] you get the upper hand the chances are they're going to retreat because they're not holding the
[01:34:39] ground. They don't care if they lose ground. They'll run away. They want to live their cowards.
[01:34:45] And so they'll back away but if you don't do that, if you don't step up and you don't take
[01:34:52] the initiative they will absolutely overrun them and they'll overrun you. And so Travis, one man counter
[01:34:58] attack here and then he's yelling to his teammates, hey go help out. Let's go. Let's make this happen.
[01:35:05] Back to the book. Although the sniper would usually have been long gone by now. The AK47
[01:35:11] fire from other buildings caused so much initial confusion that the mid team still wasn't sure
[01:35:17] which building he had fired from. Like a vulture circling is prey. The enemy marksman continued
[01:35:23] scanning the alley before spotting Travis who's firing away on another rooftop. So this is a
[01:35:29] cover and move situation too where the sniper's taking precision shots but the guys can't really
[01:35:35] identify because they're getting shot at from a bunch of different locations as well.
[01:35:42] Back to the book. Across the city, first lieutenant Kim was handing crayons to smiling Iraqi kids
[01:35:49] with second lieutenant Alexander. Though Kim wondered how Travis and the guys were faring inside
[01:35:54] the pizza slice, they had been through so many battles in the last five months without a casualty
[01:35:59] that the mid team seemed indestructible. As Kim knelt with a happy child, he suddenly heard
[01:36:06] unintelligible screaming from the radio inside his vehicle, contact yelled a voice, possibly
[01:36:12] staff sergeant Perry, the driver of the Humvee Kim was originally supposed to be in.
[01:36:17] Kim looked straight at Alexander who had heard the same front exams and both men motioned to
[01:36:23] their Iraqi counterparts to sit with the kids while they check things out.
[01:36:27] The transmission, the transmissions were broken but now the sound of petty's voice screaming
[01:36:32] contact came through crystal clear. About saying a single word about what to do next,
[01:36:38] Kim and Alexander jumped in a separate vehicles with their respective drivers told the
[01:36:42] Iraqis to handle the rest of the school supply drop and spread towards the pizza slice and its
[01:36:48] unknown turmoil. As they listened to broken radio transmission and tried to communicate with Perry,
[01:36:54] who was frantically trying to contact camp solution, requested quick reaction force. The
[01:36:59] marine silently navigated through the pizza slice's narrow confusing streets, not completely
[01:37:05] sure of where their mid team brothers were pinned down. They knew a battle was raging but neither
[01:37:11] marine had any idea how serious it was nor did they realize Albino and Seagull had been hit.
[01:37:18] After looping around the pizza slice, the two vehicles turned right onto route Elizabeth near
[01:37:23] the blackwater bridge, heading east and the seriousness of the situation slapped Kim and Alexander
[01:37:29] in the face. The normally bust bustling, packed marketplace was completely empty.
[01:37:37] If tumble weeds had blown across the street, this section of Felicia would have looked exactly
[01:37:40] like a deserted town in an old western spaghetti. Jesus Christ Alexander said,
[01:37:45] where the fuck are they Kim yelled in frustration? Suddenly they heard gunfire. There,
[01:37:49] Alexander said pointing at the besieged alleyway where the two American homies were still being
[01:37:54] riddled by bullets. As both marine stopped on route Elizabeth facing east, the marine's
[01:38:02] jumped out and ran as quickly as they could, ducking rifles, ducking as rifles continued to crack
[01:38:07] towards their comrades. Kim then confronted an image that would stay with him for the rest of his life.
[01:38:15] Travis was lying near the back of the driver's side tire of the humvee he had been riding in
[01:38:20] his eyes wide open but glazed over with emptiness. Kim saw no blood but it was obvious that
[01:38:27] something horrible had occurred in that rich, violent alley. For the first time in the entire deployment
[01:38:35] sheer panic seized Kim as he ran with Alexander up to Kabiki who is kneeling by Travis while
[01:38:40] filing firing his nine millimeter handgun at one of the buildings after running out of rifle ammunition.
[01:38:48] Kim asked firing his own rifle where do you need us to go? Get the wounded Kabiki said,
[01:38:55] get them out of here. Who else has hit Alexander said, see go and dock. Kabiki said before moving
[01:39:02] to another position to continue firing. Swinging open the passenger side, back door for cover as he
[01:39:09] fired Kim saw a seagull who had avoided being shot again but was still in great pain lying in the
[01:39:14] back seat. Despite being on his back he was reaching down to the floor trying to find more ammunition
[01:39:21] for the turret gunner. His left wrist was breathing profusely. The major order is out.
[01:39:28] Kim said, do you need help? I can make it Seagull said, you got to get Lieutenant Manion.
[01:39:34] I think he's dead. My vehicle is right over there. Kim said pointing toward
[01:39:40] rattle is a bit go. Now that reinforcements had arrived the sniper was gone and the insurgents
[01:39:47] were pulling back. Seagull mustering all his strength, exited the humvee on the passenger side
[01:39:53] and hurried to Kim's vehicle where he collapsed in the back seat. He knew he had been shot in the
[01:39:58] stomach by this point and wasn't sure if you would make it. But even Seagull ran to the intersection.
[01:40:05] Even as Seagull ran to the intersection the wounded Marines thought were focused on the unforgettable
[01:40:10] scene he had just witnessed. Seagull didn't see Travis get shot by the sniper. But after dragging
[01:40:17] himself to the driver's side of the vehicle the Lance Corpel was shocked to see the first lieutenant
[01:40:22] lying face down in motionless. His arms stretched toward the curb with his feet facing toward
[01:40:28] the bullet riddled vehicle. When Seagull pulled himself towards Travis and asked him where he'd
[01:40:34] been hit he got no response. He realized Travis was seriously wounded and started feeling underneath
[01:40:42] his fellow Marines body armor with his left hand despite the hole in his own aching wrist.
[01:40:47] He found a bullet wound on the left side of Travis's rib gauge. He whispered in Travis's ear.
[01:40:56] Hey Travis said Seagull, Seagull, who normally would have addressed him as lieutenant or Sir.
[01:41:03] I'm here for you. Travis didn't respond. Even without realizing that the sniper's bullet had
[01:41:12] struck the first lieutenant from the right side and had exited at the spot he was covering with his left
[01:41:17] hand. Seagull knew the situation was grave. When Travis began jerking with convulsions.
[01:41:26] Is he dead? Kabiki yelled over to Seagull while continuing to fire at enemy positions?
[01:41:32] Not yet but he will be if we don't do something. The Lance Corpel said his voice shaking.
[01:41:39] Seagull turned to Travis. Whose eyes were still wide open.
[01:41:46] I'm here for you Seagull, repeated over and over again into his ear.
[01:41:52] As soon as Kim and Alexander had carried their unresponsive friend into the vehicle,
[01:41:57] Kabiki ran over and dove into the smoke-filled home-view where he clutched Travis and began trying
[01:42:01] to identify his wounds, stopping the bleeding, and performed CPR.
[01:42:05] He ordered petty to start driving towards Camp Felicia while Wilson
[01:42:10] Wilson fired the last rounds from the turret. This was probably Kabiki's last chance to save his fellow
[01:42:18] Marine. As four vehicles, spread toward Camp Felicia, Father John Gaten,
[01:42:26] a Marine Corps chaplain from Pennsylvania, sat in his tiny office on the make-ship
[01:42:31] American base. He was reading emails from home while sipping from a large water bottle to keep
[01:42:37] hydrated on the steamy Sunday afternoon. A few minutes later, his phone rang. We got two wounded
[01:42:44] in action, and one possible killed in action arriving at the field hospital, a North Roo
[01:42:48] Unnurs reported. As the Marines ran over to the wooden complex, he saw a group of Marines.
[01:42:56] Kim, Alexander, Kabiki, Morang, Petty, Marquette, Wilson, and Brianer
[01:43:03] huddled like a team on a football field. As he jogged by one of them turned around and looked at him.
[01:43:11] Father John saw the redness in the eyes of this Marine who had obviously been crying.
[01:43:18] It was clear that something terrible had happened.
[01:43:21] Any Marines with typo positive blood reported immediately to field hospital room four,
[01:43:27] a voice set over the loudspeaker.
[01:43:35] As they tore off, as they tore off his bloody fatigues before finding the wounds on each side of
[01:43:44] his rib cage and trying to resuscitate him, crowds began to form in the hallway outside the operating room.
[01:43:51] Word was quickly spreading. That first lieutenant Travis Manion, the heart and soul of the
[01:43:57] mid team was badly wounded. Yeah, he gave it all. He gave it all that day. He gave it all
[01:44:15] every moment he was over there and working with the Marines, working with the Iraqis and
[01:44:21] and that last event. He ran out of ammo. I was talking to the gunner and
[01:44:36] start to ask him about what he saw, trying to figure out, you know, the, we've got what was
[01:44:41] written up and as a warden, just trying to get some insights and the gunner said, you know,
[01:44:46] lieutenant was calling for more ammo. So I'm thinking that Travis, I saw when he was over there,
[01:44:53] he had all sorts of magazines. So I don't know how many rounds that I'm guessing around
[01:44:59] maybe 90 to 100 rounds he had on himself and he'd actually laid down a lot of fire to change the
[01:45:06] moment. But I, you know, he knew what he was doing. He exposed himself. He had to do that to
[01:45:13] get out there and laid down the fire. And when I spoke to the gunner, Wilson, he said, you know,
[01:45:21] we threw out a magazine. I turned around when I turned back Travis's land on the ground.
[01:45:26] So maybe he was trying to get that magazine and, and load it into his weapon. He'd run out of
[01:45:33] all of his ammunition and laying cover for these guys. Yeah, and like you said, I mean, just,
[01:45:41] somebody had to turn the momentum. Yeah. Otherwise they were going to get overrun. Yeah, and he knew
[01:45:46] that. He knew that. If not me, then who? You know, he knew what he had to do. I know that
[01:45:57] because they had lost, I got to let her from Kibicki shortly afterwards and he said, you know,
[01:46:04] we're using Travis's words to go on because he, they had lost some guys and he had pulled the
[01:46:08] team and it said, look, we got to, they'd want us to go on. We got to keep working. We got to
[01:46:13] turn the tide here. And so he used that session that Travis had with the team and said, look,
[01:46:19] you know what Travis would think? You know what we got to do? We got to keep fighting on.
[01:46:24] And that's what they did.
[01:46:25] Father John, anointed Travis's feet and said a prayer has the medical staff tried feverously
[01:46:43] to revive him.
[01:46:45] The phone number the Marine could show the doctors some sign any sign of life soon after the
[01:46:59] physician in charge announced a time of death. For the next minute, the only sounds heard in the
[01:47:07] operating room came from the hallway outside as doctors and nurses watched in silence,
[01:47:14] Father John standing above the fallen US Marine broke the silence.
[01:47:21] God, the Father of Mercy's through the death and resurrection of your son,
[01:47:26] you have reconciled the world to yourself and sent a Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of
[01:47:33] sins. He said, looking down at Travis through the ministry of the church,
[01:47:39] May God grant you pardon and peace. And I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father,
[01:47:52] kind of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. One by one, Marines filed past their fallen brother,
[01:48:12] Kabiki, the senior officer who desperately administered CPR in the humvee was the first to walk by,
[01:48:17] Marine was next then Wilson, Marquette, and Breiner. When Petty looked at the fallen first
[01:48:26] lieutenant's face, he saw an officer who had given everything to the Marine Corps.
[01:48:35] When Alexander approached the operating table with tears streaming down his face,
[01:48:39] he put his hand on his friend's head. He didn't know how the mission could carry on without him.
[01:48:49] Kim approached the table with weak knees and a broken heart. He paused to take one last look at
[01:48:56] his friend who had saved his life by volunteering to go on a patrol. He knew would be far more dangerous
[01:49:03] than a school supply drop. Pauzing for a moment, Kim pondered the story that was already
[01:49:14] spreading throughout the hospital complex without thinking twice. Travis had left squarely
[01:49:21] into enemy crosshairs to direct gunfire away from his patrol.
[01:49:25] On April 29, 2007, a line of the Iraq war was struck down by a single bullet.
[01:49:39] Cut through Travis's Aorta, causing massive internal bleeding that couldn't be controlled.
[01:49:47] Though the fallen Marines loved ones, would undoubtedly suffer everyone else on the pizza slice
[01:49:54] patrol was still alive. Indeed, by fearlessly protecting his Marines and the Iraqi serving beside them.
[01:50:07] First Lieutenant Travis Manion had done his part.
[01:50:10] Yes, so clearly in writing this, it's sort of as a father obviously really tough to
[01:50:27] to go through and talk to the guys that were with them and relive that.
[01:50:32] But the other side of it is it's a little healing, did this sort of no exactly what was going on
[01:50:42] with the guys that were there with him, felt about his actions that day.
[01:50:48] And so as I went through the struggle of times, when I realized that unless we tell these stories
[01:51:02] the rest of the country is not going to know what these guys are doing.
[01:51:07] So we got to make sure that we get the word out there and there was a big part of it
[01:51:11] is sitting down and talking through that day, a big part of the struggle for me and putting this book together.
[01:51:21] And you just, I mean, it's a, I would say it's a miracle that everyone else lived.
[01:51:26] But it's actually just Travis that everyone lived in a situation like that, surrounded by enemy,
[01:51:32] a sniper, multiple enemy positions firing on you. You got nine guys and two on these.
[01:51:38] That is not a good situation to be in and it's going to take a miracle to get out of it.
[01:51:42] And the fact that he's the only guy that was killed is incredible and it's clearly, you know,
[01:51:49] due to his actions. Clearly, I mean, again, you have, the enemy has elevated positions too.
[01:51:58] Yeah, this is on the rooftops and so yeah, I mean it's important.
[01:52:04] And obviously to tell the story and people to know this sacrifice and I mean a lot of people
[01:52:10] listen to this that are active duty in the military and that sort of aggressiveness on the battlefield
[01:52:19] when things are going bad is going to keep people alive. And obviously you've got to be a courageous
[01:52:25] courageous human being to do that. But the alternative, you know, in this case, would have been
[01:52:31] incredibly horrible. I got to several of the guys were there, whether it was the dock when I
[01:52:40] went to see him, but that is to talk about the impact of what Travis did or Lieutenant Morang was
[01:52:47] there and he sent me a message and said, hey, you know, there's no doubt in my mind that Travis
[01:52:51] saved my life in the life of the entire patrol that day. So I mean the guys that were there were
[01:52:57] with them, they know what I'm. How much longer after this did you start writing this book?
[01:53:12] Wow, about five years afterwards, just started to get down to writing it.
[01:53:20] And I, you know, there's a story behind that too, right? I mean, the last time I talked to Travis
[01:53:28] was a week before we lost him. And it was an unusual call because normally I was with my wife and this
[01:53:36] time I wasn't, it was about by myself. And I guess he felt a little bit more open to share with me
[01:53:42] what was going on and he was, you could sense that there was a lot of happening. And he had a message
[01:53:49] for me, kept sharing that he said that it's incredible what I'm seeing over here. It's incredible
[01:53:54] what these young Marines are doing, what I'm seeing every day they're fighting in the streets.
[01:54:01] They're putting it on the line. I don't think the rest of the country knows what's going on.
[01:54:05] And he knew that because he could back to Camp Feluse, the turn on the TV and see what we were
[01:54:09] watching back here. And then he'd be on patrol and just sort of see the incredible things that
[01:54:14] were going on and it was a huge disconnect for him. And he got cut off several times in that phone
[01:54:21] call and he kept calling me back and he'd start all over again. Dad, you really, you really got to
[01:54:29] get the message back to people. It's incredible what's happening here. You know, the American
[01:54:35] people don't know the incredible things these guys are doing. And so I got cut off of them the
[01:54:42] last time. And I always signed off to tell how much the love them and it was the first time
[01:54:49] that I missed them. I figured okay, I'll hear from them next weekend. And we got to knock on the door
[01:54:56] that next weekend that we lost Travis. You know, your worst nightmare, your only son, so proud of them
[01:55:04] and figured okay, most natural thing for us is the roll down the shades, lock the doors and just tell
[01:55:10] everyone to go away. And it was because that last conversation I had with him, we knew there was
[01:55:17] going to be media and sure enough there was. I pulled my wife and daughter together, I said, you know what?
[01:55:24] When they call us, we're going to talk. And really this book is about talking about sharing the
[01:55:31] stories. I've been on that mission since the last time I talked to Travis and he gave me that
[01:55:36] mission to do this. And so I was pretty certain early on that was going to do something. And
[01:55:42] initially I thought, okay, I heard about Travis and his Marines and his Influcian, how they turned
[01:55:48] to Ty. So maybe that would be the story. We could talk about how these brave Marines and
[01:55:54] work together with the Iraqis to make that happen. And then we lost Brendan. You know, when I
[01:56:02] realize, you know, maybe it's not that story. Maybe it's the bigger story of our Navy SEALs and
[01:56:07] our Marines and everyone that's putting on the uniform and the sacrifices they're making.
[01:56:13] And so that's why it sort of took me a little while. I mean, we had with us Travis, you know,
[01:56:19] seven, we lost Brendan in 2010 and I had just come back from doing some of the stuff over in
[01:56:25] Iraq. I started to think, well, maybe it's a different story. And when you do a really, you know,
[01:56:35] an amazing job in the book of talking about how you how your family, how you, you and your family,
[01:56:42] you know, dealt with the loss. And but is there anything that you find? I mean, did you find it
[01:56:51] to be sort of therapeutic to say, look, we have a new mission now. Our mission is to get the
[01:56:56] word out and tell the story and learn as much as we can about it and let other people know what's
[01:57:00] going on? I think it was, it definitely helped, you know, to know that we could do something with
[01:57:08] his loss, you know, get out there. And if we could do something to bridge the gap between
[01:57:15] the country and our military and our guys and men and women serving in uniform,
[01:57:19] you know, it's certainly gave us something to get up every morning and have a reason.
[01:57:27] And when we started thinking about his message, you know, part of that, if not me, then who message?
[01:57:31] That goes back to that last conversation I have with him because when we started telling the
[01:57:35] stories, my son-in-law shared that story with a newspaper and all of a sudden, that if not me,
[01:57:41] then who sort of caught on and people started to say, you know what? I like that. It was five
[01:57:48] simple but really, really powerful words and that's what we use now as our sort of rally
[01:57:54] cry for our foundation. If not me, then who? You went through this, you know, you went through
[01:58:02] your loss of Travis and did you get closer with Brendan after that or did it maintain or?
[01:58:11] Yeah, we got a lot closer with Brendan. I mean, absolutely. Brendan was in seal training when
[01:58:19] we lost Travis and I still remember that call with with my wife. But yeah, he would come and
[01:58:26] in visit us and still remember when he came back and he came right up to our place and
[01:58:34] mostly people felt uncomfortable coming to visit the parents by themselves so they'd come and
[01:58:39] groups. But when Brendan called up, shortly after he got back and I said, okay, will you come
[01:58:44] up with Brendan? He says, I'm coming by myself and we spent the night doing shots of the
[01:58:49] drone and our bar and talking about stories of he and Travis and their friendship.
[01:58:54] Well, another thing was Travis or Brendan had just started buds and you know, he was saying,
[01:59:02] hey, I'm going to come home for the funeral and you and your wife said, no, you do what you
[01:59:06] got to do, you got to get through this training, you know, you can come later. Yeah, which is,
[01:59:11] well, we knew he was just sort of struggling with the loss in a big, big way and he wanted to
[01:59:18] be there and you know, he was sharing that with my wife, real strong and, you know, he knew what
[01:59:26] Travis wanted him to do is to carry on and and so he did that, you know, and he sure did that
[01:59:34] in a big way out there and San Diego. Yeah, and Brendan crushed crushed buds and you don't throw
[01:59:42] that around, bite me. You don't throw around someone crushing buds lately. And one of the things
[01:59:48] one of the quotes that they pulled out in here that he applied during buds was, one of Brendan's
[01:59:55] favorite quotes was one he rarely spoke out loud, but always kept in the back of his mind.
[02:00:00] Be strong, be accountable, never complain. Yeah, that's Brendan. Absolutely. And that attitude
[02:00:10] going in, he ended up being the honor man of his buds class and so the honor man is the guy
[02:00:17] that's basically the best performer in everything. And again, you're going to buds, you got some
[02:00:24] competitive high level athletes in there and to be the honor man, you got to be a bit of a bad
[02:00:32] ass. Yeah. Well, some of the guys who were there with him share with me that it wasn't even close,
[02:00:37] even, you know, I mean, like he was blowing everything away. So he was, he was possessed as they,
[02:00:45] they share with me. That's, that sounds like, that sounds like he was definitely getting after it.
[02:00:51] And, and, and, you know, I, I won't even say I imagine I actually know for a fact that
[02:01:00] losing Travis must have fueled his fire beyond anyone could be probably had, you're right. There
[02:01:05] was no, I was going to compete with that, you know, he knew he had a job to do. And so much so that when
[02:01:13] when he got done and graduated in my wife, Janet and I were at the wedding
[02:01:18] meeting with Amy and Brendan that he called Janet over and gave Janet his Navy seal
[02:01:26] tried and, and, you know, he just did it privately. It was the way Brendan was gave it to her
[02:01:34] and said you know, I couldn't have gotten this without Travis being there with me every step
[02:01:38] of a way. And I want you to have this. And I was at the other end of the room and I still remember
[02:01:46] Janet coming up with tears in her eyes and sharing that story with me. It was just sort of the
[02:01:51] type of guy Brendan was, you know. Yeah, that's just, I mean, that was another thing that
[02:01:55] that, that, in the book you talk about is he got the honor man plaque and, like, he like mailed it to
[02:02:01] his parents. Yeah. And his attitude was, hey, this isn't on me, you know, this is on you. Thanks
[02:02:05] for support over the years. Yeah. And then given the tried to, to your wife, Janet, I mean,
[02:02:10] just a humble humble guy that always gave credit to everyone else and, and your wife gave him
[02:02:17] the black bracelet that said, first lieutenant Travis man in USMC, Spartan hero leader,
[02:02:28] killed an Iraq Iraqi freedom, 29 April of 07. And then this had to be hard for you.
[02:02:39] You can now you're even closer with Brendan, with Brendan, you're even closer with Brendan.
[02:02:44] And he tells you guys at his wedding. So you're there celebrating the wedding and all of a
[02:02:51] sudden he says, I don't know something to tell you. Going to Iraq in 48 hours. Yeah.
[02:02:57] Was, and by the way, he's going to fallusia. Did he tell you guys he was going to fallusia?
[02:03:01] Yeah, he told us where he's headed. You know, hard to believe, you know, he's there,
[02:03:06] celebrating such a great day. And then to find out that his honeymoon's in fluency.
[02:03:13] You know, I think, you know, you hear about, we hear so much about our guys in uniform and
[02:03:19] what they're doing, but just sort of think about those types of sacrifices. You know, we don't
[02:03:23] hear enough of that stuff, you know, what the families are going through and missing those special
[02:03:29] times, you know, it's a big, big impact all the way around. Well, I was trying to remind people
[02:03:36] that the heroes that we talk about, their heroes and their people, their people like everyone else
[02:03:42] with wives and families and they miss their home, they miss their family. They want to be at the
[02:03:50] dance recital and the basketball game and the wrestling match. They're not just these, you know,
[02:03:58] foreign objects that just do nothing to fight man, their people. And I always trying to remind
[02:04:03] everyone of that. And this is a classic example. Here he is, Marion is sweetheart who had met
[02:04:09] at the Naval Academy, spending time with you, spending time with his family and he's leaving for
[02:04:15] Iraq, 48 hours later, honeymoon in fluency. Yeah, big, big sacrifice for these guys.
[02:04:23] And he does that deployment to fluency. And kind of, you know, here's a letter that he wrote home on
[02:04:32] that Miss Manion, it was great to see you guys at the wedding. I'm glad you guys were able to make it
[02:04:37] mental out to both me and Amy to see you both there. I'm doing okay over here. Since since arriving,
[02:04:43] I've been tasked with reviewing all the e-vals. It's evaluation in awards for the command
[02:04:48] as well as work in the Tactical Operations Center. I'm sure you've heard about the decreased violence
[02:04:53] out here and provincial Iraqi control taking place in Alambar to see how much different it is over here
[02:05:00] since last time as a true testament to the work that everyone over here has done. I've not had the
[02:05:06] opportunity to get out to combat outpost Manion on a trip out west to Alassad,
[02:05:14] while myself and Rob Sarver, another US Naval Academy, O4 guy who knew Travis, we're waiting
[02:05:21] for our he-load of show up. We struck up a conversation with a young Lance Corporal. This young
[02:05:25] Marine was a mid-team member and had mentioned that he'd just come from cop Manion. When we heard
[02:05:31] that, I let him know that Travis was a good friend of mine in a college and a roommate during
[02:05:35] college. He said that he did not know him, but he'd heard great things about Travis. He also said
[02:05:42] that there was a room at the cop dedicated to him with pictures. I just thought you would like that
[02:05:47] story since Travis is still influencing the men and women over here. Love Brendan.
[02:05:53] Yeah, he eventually made it out there. Rob shared with me. Oh, he made it out to cop Manion.
[02:05:59] Was the cop Manion in Fludja? It was Northearch. It was Northearch.
[02:06:03] If you've ever been through karma, I didn't go through karma.
[02:06:07] Yeah, so karma is when I was over there, they flew me out to Camp Fludja and then
[02:06:14] karma's not too far away from Camp Fludja and it's a little Northearch of karma. So the
[02:06:19] Iraqis said that one of the name of the outpost after Travis, which was again for their
[02:06:27] recognition of what he put on the line for them. Awesome. But you could see from that note that
[02:06:40] what Brendan was facing in Fludja at that time, even over what a bit of a six-month period
[02:06:46] or something maybe longer than that, but it was completely mellow compared to what Travis was
[02:06:51] in Durn. We were just way ahead at that time. Yeah, it changed dramatically at that point for sure.
[02:06:58] And so Brendan had a fairly mellow deployment comes home and then goes back on deployment.
[02:07:06] Again, like you just said, new wife, you just went on deployment, doesn't matter. We're sending
[02:07:10] you back on deployment. That's the way it works. Two, three, four deployments? Yep.
[02:07:14] Yeah. So now we're talking, he goes back this time and goes to Afghanistan.
[02:07:22] You know, just a little bit about Brendan's leadership with a Taliban launching. It's annual
[02:07:27] spring offensive. Brendan and his platoon started to see more action in May. Just as he had
[02:07:32] predicted in his email to Tom and Janet surrounded by jagged cliffs, extreme poverty and acute
[02:07:39] desolation, which many of the younger seals had never experienced. It was Brendan's responsibility
[02:07:43] to keep them optimistic, focused and sharp considering that the seals were sleeping on a
[02:07:49] fob in the middle of nowhere, thousands of miles away from home, setting a positive tone was never
[02:07:53] an easy task. Rather than barking out orders to the seals under his command, Brendan was loom dog.
[02:08:01] They enlisted seals as they loved working for the 29 year old lieutenant because even though
[02:08:08] Brendan was an officer, he still fought of himself as one of the boys. So, you know, you see a very
[02:08:12] similar type of attitude. Yeah, his guys, you know, having a chance to talk to them, they, you know,
[02:08:19] everybody loved Brendan. And he was just a great, great leader, right? Yeah. No doubt. Like I said,
[02:08:26] the biggest thing I remember about him, you know, was no matter what I was saying to him, not not an
[02:08:32] attitude, but just like a positive attitude. I'll say that. Yeah. He's getting towards the end of
[02:08:38] that deployment, like right towards the end of that deployment. And goes back and forth,
[02:08:47] emails with Amy on Monday, Amy and Brendan exchanged emails, six months that Amy dreaded
[02:08:55] were coming to a close and finally they would be living together again as husband and wife.
[02:09:00] Brendan could barely contain himself during his last reply before his last mission.
[02:09:04] Can't wait to get home and go on a long overdue vacation with you. I call you when I get back
[02:09:10] from my office. Love you, Missia. Me. So, they were allowed on this operation. Brendan
[02:09:22] assignment in support of Operation C. Serpent and ongoing joint anti-terror assault was to watch over
[02:09:28] the village of Ayatala in the mountains in southeastern Afghanistan province of Zabul.
[02:09:37] As on other tactical Overwatch missions on this one, Brendan and his team would serve as guardian
[02:09:43] angels, much like when Travis held the roof during after a chlorine attack in Follugia.
[02:09:50] No matter what transpired in the darkness below, Brendan and his seals equipped with
[02:09:54] night vision equipment would be watching. Quiet and focused, we tend to Brendan Looney flew
[02:10:00] above the skies of Afghanistan on the 59th combat mission of his fourth overseas deployment.
[02:10:06] As bright moonlight shined into the chopper through the war zone, soaring mountains,
[02:10:11] the words Spartan, Hero, Leader reflected from the bracelet, Brendan always wore on his right
[02:10:20] wrist. Moments from landing on top of a mountain, the seals and soldiers aboard the chopper
[02:10:27] on hook their safety belts and prepared to dismount. Suddenly a terrible piercing sound
[02:10:33] stunned everyone aboard the helicopter which rapidly tumbled down a jagged steep cliff
[02:10:39] before plunging into the darkness. The frantic moments then ensued were harrowing, dreadful,
[02:10:46] and tragic. So that's Brendan's just think about it. His 59th combat mission
[02:10:57] and he's two weeks from coming home and the new group comes in and who's the one guy that says,
[02:11:04] you know what I'll go with the new guys and show him around. We've been out here the whole time.
[02:11:09] I don't want them going out there without anyone and that's Brendan Looney.
[02:11:13] Yeah. And he jumps in and held a cop to win down and only once survived.
[02:11:22] Yeah, it's a turnover operation as what we call it. That's when you're taking the new guys as you
[02:11:28] said, I think these guys were from team four, taking them out, you know, you're just one guy
[02:11:33] that's hey we've done this before. We'll just do a turnover and make sure you guys know what's
[02:11:37] happening and give any advice we can. And like you said, you're ready to go home. Yeah. And
[02:11:46] somebody's got to step up and do that. And like you said, who's going to do it? Well,
[02:11:52] Brendan's going to do it. Yeah. And you know after Brendan was killed and you guys,
[02:12:00] you know, Amy had said she wanted Brendan to be buried next to Travis.
[02:12:10] Yeah, you know, you, yes, you know, wonder why things happen the way they do. But we never had
[02:12:16] that talk with Travis like what happens if you don't come back. And when we lost him, my wife and I were
[02:12:23] like, well, we should have him near us here at home. So we've buried him close by us and outside of
[02:12:29] Philadelphia. And then shortly after that, we heard from some family and friends that, hey,
[02:12:34] they had a serious conversation with Travis and he said he wanted to be in Arlington if anything.
[02:12:38] I'm told. So I called down the Arlington. They said, yeah, we can we've re-interred, we can do that.
[02:12:45] Just let us know if you want that to happen and we'll make an happen. So we never got
[02:12:51] Travis situated and never had a headstone, had a wooden cross there and we kept talking about it.
[02:12:59] You know, and it's almost three years later and my wife was the one that was most reluctant
[02:13:05] because she was visiting Travis every day and she just couldn't come to grips with making that decision.
[02:13:11] And then we get to call the first person that did Brendan's mom called was my wife,
[02:13:16] Janet, when she got the news and we were just devastated. And we got down there and Amy came
[02:13:23] in the town and she said, you know, I want I went Brendan next to Travis and Arlington.
[02:13:29] Now she knew she was at Travis's service. She knew Travis wasn't in Arlington but maybe she
[02:13:34] had forgotten in the shock. And I know how that goes. You're just in total shock.
[02:13:38] And at that point I could just see it in my wife's eyes. She said this is it. This is
[02:13:46] now we need to do this. She was ready to do it. And they moved mountains to make it happen.
[02:13:51] I mean they departmented the army and Arlington moved, helped us move Travis down there in two
[02:13:59] weeks and then we laid Brendan that following Monday.
[02:14:05] We're just, originally said let's do this the same day. And I was like well no this is
[02:14:11] Brendan's day. We're just like a quiet ceremony. So we did it the Friday before and this quiet
[02:14:16] ceremony. We had, we had all the Marines from, from Manion Hall down at where the officer school was
[02:14:26] they have a hall named after Travis. They all showed up and of course the loonies you think about
[02:14:31] our service members but the strength of the families they insisted with all that we're going
[02:14:36] through that they were going to be over there and they were there with us. So we laid Travis down
[02:14:42] on that Friday and then Brendan the following Monday and Secretary Gates was there and all his
[02:14:49] Navy seals were there to pay him respects and they put their tridents in his, you know, his
[02:14:57] coffin and it was a real emotional time obviously you know just like such a such a tough time.
[02:15:09] I'm going to close out the book here with the words that you spoke on the day that you
[02:15:17] in turn Travis Adderlington. I want to thank the looney family for their presence here today.
[02:15:29] Our hearts go out to you as you deal with us incredible loss. Brendan represents the best
[02:15:37] this country has to offer. We mourn him now and we will forever the passing of this American hero.
[02:15:51] There are so many mixed emotions for us as we move Travis to this place of honor.
[02:15:59] Brendan's loss fills all our waking hours yet we're moving Travis to be next to his great friend
[02:16:05] and together with all their warrior brothers and sisters who've paid their full measure
[02:16:15] defending freedom. This solemn place leaves us with a sadness for the sacrifices but also
[02:16:24] extremely proud of these brave Americans who so unselfishly and courageously step forward to
[02:16:31] confront the evil that faces our world. We the families of these defenders of freedom can't
[02:16:40] begin to describe the void that fills our hearts but we can tell you how much our sons and daughters
[02:16:48] love this country and all that it stands for. We are now their voice.
[02:16:56] So Travis as we lay you here today beside your brother Brendan and with all your fellow patriots
[02:17:10] we will always remember the selfless service and sacrifice and we will continue to rally in
[02:17:19] your honor with the call if not me then who to make a difference for others and to always
[02:17:29] step forward to do what's right no matter what the cost. God bless you my son and
[02:17:41] rest in peace with your warrior brothers and sisters. First lieutenant Travis Manion United States Marine
[02:17:51] Corps Lieutenant Brendan Looney United States Navy Warriors for freedom brothers forever.
[02:18:12] Yes so when you think about section 60 and all the loss there and
[02:18:17] you know symbolically there Brendan and Travis great friends and there side by side and
[02:18:27] armington if you're ever there you know when I'm out talking to people I say you know if you don't
[02:18:31] if you haven't taken your family the armington put it on the list you're in DC or make a special trip to DC
[02:18:39] to go see armington and teach your family about that sacrifice and make sure you go to section 60 where
[02:18:45] all those heroes of today have I reckon Afghanistan or there's always something that's happening
[02:18:52] in section 60 and after that September when we moved Travis in that following spring the Navy
[02:19:03] seals found and killed those some have been ladden and then a couple weeks later the
[02:19:09] president spoke about Travis and Brendan as an example for the country in Arlington and his
[02:19:14] memorial deadress we were down there with the loonies to hear that but again their their story is a
[02:19:22] story that could be anybody story there's so many in uniform that do so much and for me writing this
[02:19:30] book is is telling their story but making sure it's part of that bigger story and the people
[02:19:36] appreciate arm men when I mean uniform and all they are and what they stand for.
[02:19:41] Well it's an amazing story and Travis is still doing good right now with his name and you
[02:19:52] guys started the Travis Canyon foundation tell us a little bit about that.
[02:19:58] Well you know as I shared earlier you know we wanted to make sure we made an impact and we got the
[02:20:05] word out and and part of that was my wife said you know I'm going to start a foundation and I
[02:20:10] wanted to be there for our veterans make sure I'm supporting the families of the fallen and the last
[02:20:16] part of it was was making sure that we do something to support that next generation of leaders.
[02:20:23] So she started a character program character does matter where we get veterans in front of young
[02:20:28] kids and talk about character and service and integrity and leadership and you know my wife started
[02:20:38] that we we had good friends that were there when we lost Travis they said you know what you
[02:20:42] guys should set up a memorial fund and a little flowers and we did that and before we knew it when
[02:20:49] we turned around and looked at the bank account we had money coming in from all over the country and we
[02:20:55] had $200,000 my wife had $200,000 and she had those five words from Travis if not me than who
[02:21:03] and she got going with that with those two things and she came in every day first started right
[02:21:10] in our kitchen and started working it and you know she worked it to when we lost her most
[02:21:17] Janet five years almost five years to the day after Travis we lost my wife to cancer and I
[02:21:23] guess you know you think about that that sacrifice and the impact on the families and
[02:21:28] I remember doing some research after we found out she had cancer and said as she had a significant
[02:21:33] stressful event in the last four to five years yeah you know she lost her son and we think about
[02:21:40] that and then you think about Brendan's mom who recently died of cancer or JP Blacks Miss
[02:21:47] Mom who died of cancer you know so the impact is significant across the board for our families
[02:21:54] and our our guys and gals and uniform so we got going on that and in my daughter's picked it up
[02:22:01] since and she's doing a great job with it she's working with a lot of a lot of great young people
[02:22:07] Amy Looney's another one of the leaders of the foundation and she heads up operations in Washington
[02:22:13] DC we've got an office here in San Diego we've got one we just opened up in Atlanta we're outside
[02:22:20] of Philadelphia Washington we're getting ready to open up an office in Chicago and we've got an
[02:22:24] office in Houston Texas and we're working with our veterans and helping them through transition
[02:22:30] we're working with the families and you know you asked before is this was this somewhat
[02:22:36] telling this story a little bit therapeutic and you know doing this foundation and pushing that
[02:22:43] forward was that therapeutic and you know we really believe it is you know and we believe you know
[02:22:48] there's a grieving period but we know that Travis would not want us to keep grieving
[02:22:55] it wants us to say hey let's go you know pick it up and get out there and and do something
[02:23:02] and make a difference and so we do that you know that's what we do every day and we give some of the
[02:23:07] families chance to do that too we get families to go out and go on expeditions and help
[02:23:13] those that are in need build houses and it's really great for them you know it's great to see them
[02:23:20] out there doing something in honor of the lost one loved one and making an impact for others
[02:23:26] what's the best way for people to support where can they find out information about the Travis
[02:23:32] Manion Foundation yeah then go on our website Travismanion.org okay got a lot of information
[02:23:38] there were around the country doing different things we've got offices in some locations but we've
[02:23:43] got activities almost everywhere and for us it's about joining they if not me then who movement
[02:23:51] you know making a difference wherever you can and you can do that in a lot of different ways
[02:23:56] that's awesome um
[02:24:01] echo speaking of supporting things sure if someone wanted to support let's say for instance

[02:27:47] I'd see that's better than zero see so boom subscribe to YouTube you'll get some excerpts along with
[02:27:53] the video version of this podcast if you're into looking at what jockel looks like what Tom looks like
[02:28:00] or what I look like if you're watching on YouTube there's a lot of controversy when we first put
[02:28:05] on YouTube because echo doesn't look like what he sounds like apparently he sounds like a hipster 15-year-old
[02:28:13] hipster hipster oh something yeah yeah something more long okay little did they know that I mean
[02:28:20] they and totally saw them then they figured out you should 20 year old head yeah I know about
[02:28:28] dang but yeah you know if you're interested in that kind of stuff about the excerpts really are
[02:28:33] helpful because you can share them and people will actually watch them like my brother sends me this
[02:28:37] actually you know what I was about to say this like maybe two three times ago but I ended up for
[02:28:41] whatever reason that's it jaddle send me a video and be like hey watch this and then I'll be like
[02:28:47] bro I'm not gonna watch this video right now it's like five ten minutes long actually it was like nine
[02:28:52] minutes something too much for you too much for me and the thing is nine minutes that's not that long
[02:28:57] but the point still stands you can't just send somebody episode 72 of this podcast that's
[02:29:05] almost three hours long as hey watch this real quick you can't do that right I'm trying to quick one
[02:29:10] exactly right especially if it's you know especially if it's just that one little part of the
[02:29:13] one I like yeah yeah extra usually you highlight himself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:29:21] yeah echo with another amazing point yeah yeah yeah you know so yeah all that's on youtube I even
[02:29:28] put them in little playlists too so you know some people are like hey I like this point and then
[02:29:32] lead you to the next point and you know you can kind of keep it going yeah that's cool I think it's cool
[02:29:37] you know also joc was a store it's called joclostore joclostore dot com and for for this website
[02:29:45] really to website with a store and I put those wallpapers back on there for your phone
[02:29:52] I just think as I didn't technically didn't take them off is when we switch platforms they just failed to
[02:29:59] translate so it was the platform's fault not yours yeah nope no extreme disjoinership on that one
[02:30:05] and you know I blame tech on that you know joc go away too over there dig it oh we're gonna get
[02:30:11] yeah that's on the on that joclostore dot com yeah you can get the joc away te on there
[02:30:16] through there um if you like t-shirts those are on there discipline equals freedom
[02:30:26] the reason I think that that's a good shirt my opinion is because of course the layers I get it
[02:30:34] but it is one of those simple little things like it's not and it's not like too extreme either it's not like
[02:30:41] echo when we designed the shirt echo wanted to put a flying tank with dragon fire coming out of
[02:30:47] its mouth yeah and a skull yeah so let's put all over the whole face all over yeah see and I
[02:30:54] feel like too much yeah yeah so or you know like it I was the same like all eat your kids for breakfast
[02:31:02] if you mess with me you know those times the crazy sayings that will only hit maybe like one out of
[02:31:07] a hundred times you know when someone reads it it's not that really cannibal's a pair of
[02:31:13] you know not many of them last right I don't think so but this one equals it it's it's
[02:31:21] for lack of a better term understated yet powerful that's my opinion anyway other shirts on there
[02:31:27] you know various messages and with those messages come layers and what that means is
[02:31:35] you can look at it and be like okay that's a cool shirt but there's more to it so if you listen to
[02:31:39] this podcast for listening to jocca you'll be like oh I get it I mean yeah okay there's more than just
[02:31:45] what's on the surface there's another layer to say yeah that's exactly right if you listen you know
[02:31:50] some rashcards on there new rashcards gonna come out in less than one week also
[02:31:58] good way to support this podcast very good way to support yourself in your journey
[02:32:06] journey or we do do people still use word journey to your word man go with it I never felt comfortable
[02:32:11] using the word journey it's you weren't going anywhere right I don't think I'm gonna have an actual
[02:32:18] journey but you know it's one of those things that you kind of hear people saying it kind of sounds epic
[02:32:24] but then when you say it it sounds real stupid I felt like the word journey is kind of like
[02:32:29] anyway yeah all right if you're on your journey to what get up early be more discipline get a better
[02:32:37] diet just get your health together get your whole thing together this is what will help you there
[02:32:43] okay so on this journey it's not gonna be you're not gonna be hitting every day like killing
[02:32:49] every day you're gonna have some days gonna be harder than others so if you're having trouble for
[02:32:55] example waking up early one day this is what you're gonna do you're gonna search psychological warfare
[02:33:03] jocco welling on iTunes or Amazon music okay so it's this album with tracks and you put on your
[02:33:09] phone whatever you listen to the track that's gonna help you get out of bed that one's called wake up
[02:33:17] wake up wake up and get after it boom so instead of instead of hitting the snooze you hit
[02:33:25] or put it as your ringtone clear it with your wife or whoever you sleep with but put it as your ringtone
[02:33:30] it's jockel's voice he'll tell you why you should wake up and get after it and you that's
[02:33:35] convincing it is you'd be so I mean wait who's there was like one we've had a year
[02:33:41] I don't want 100% success rate there's one guy because there's actually three tracks to wake up
[02:33:47] the first one to wake up the second time what did you just do you didn't get out of bed there's one guy
[02:33:53] out of a lot of people that have has made it to the second track everyone else's first track we're
[02:33:57] yeah yeah you can't you can't not get up and again that's a rare case you know that guy he
[02:34:05] probably had a really hard night the night before looking into or looking forward to really really
[02:34:11] hard day and that's why he was considering training wheels right yeah in a way all's at a
[02:34:16] spa spot like you like spot yeah it's better yeah training wheels kind of seems like without it you
[02:34:23] fall down you know this is just for you know if I'm trying to get that max on bench this is a
[02:34:28] this is a big goal I got now on a wake up for one year I'm gonna wake up earlier something like
[02:34:32] it's just like if I have a huge goal with a bench all I'm gonna get it I'll probably get it
[02:34:38] but in the small case that let's say I'm not strong enough today I need to sleep with it
[02:34:43] right I got to spot their boom yeah don't get it same good same exact thing so yeah there it is
[02:34:48] psychological warfare and this goes for for waking up early uh skipping workouts that's a big one
[02:34:54] in my opinion skipping workouts but that's just in my experience so many asked me on time here today
[02:34:58] what was it what what do you say to yourself when you get tired and you want to quit you don't want
[02:35:06] to do anything anymore and I said I don't say anything to myself I just keep doing it
[02:35:11] next question see what that is that's that manual set you know if you're on auto you're like
[02:35:17] what are I feel like if you like not doing if I feel like I want to quit but you're just going to
[02:35:21] sort of quit automatically no no no no no no yeah take control yeah exactly right so yeah
[02:35:28] boom there's a good psychological warfare joccal will link it's good for waking up early if you
[02:35:34] have a day that you don't want to wake up earth you're gonna slip on your diet it's face it we
[02:35:37] come home for hungry nothing's in the house except for some donuts oh snap the chance of you
[02:35:43] even the donuts goes up little bit let's just face it actually a lot so boy what do you do there
[02:35:49] exactly right that's what you shouldn't have done it in your house but if you do in the event
[02:35:52] of you having donuts yes listen a psychological warfare sugar coated lies that's the name snack time
[02:35:58] and and the psychological warfare album number two is being slowly prepared at this point it's
[02:36:06] it's blue people are asking me for specific tracks little areas of weakness in life you know
[02:36:13] also jocco it you can get on amazon dot com after you click through if you don't want to dead

[02:40:57] to to talk about leadership and the lessons that you've learned jocco and in the navy seals
[02:41:05] and sharing that with others and bringing new insights about our men and women in uniform I mean
[02:41:12] you hear so much these days about the troubles that our service members have you know whether
[02:41:19] they're missing a limb they don't have a job they've got PTSD but you know we you also should
[02:41:26] be talking about is what an inspiration they are the guys they put on the uniform the men and
[02:41:30] women are put on the uniform are an inspiration for this country and and thanks for what you're
[02:41:36] doing to get the word out there thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk about this book but
[02:41:40] but more broadly the the story of our men and women in uniform and how they live every day with
[02:41:47] that if not me then who motto thanks absolutely honest or and you know sir one more thing before
[02:41:55] we close out I know you you you you were talking about a letter that you had that kind of
[02:42:00] talked about some of the leadership principles that we really learn in the military and really
[02:42:09] make military leaders excel and it's a letter that you got from one of the Marines that that
[02:42:15] worked for your son yeah you know it's sort of interesting that I you know here I am coming
[02:42:21] out to talk to you and I've had the book published for a couple years now but I just I just got this letter
[02:42:29] through coach Garrett you talked about coach Garrett and now this this Marine that was with my
[02:42:35] son sir with my son hooked up with coach Garrett had one of the wrestling events and said hey
[02:42:40] you know Colonel Man you give him this letter and you know here he is checking in after 10 years
[02:42:52] and he says things he'd like to share with me a couple things things they're not well known by
[02:43:01] people other than those and my myself that served with Travis in Follugia those memories of
[02:43:06] things I'm able to hold on to but have been wanting to share with his family as well I apologize for
[02:43:13] such a long silence it seems to be the best opportunity for me to share them with you by passing
[02:43:21] along this letter any hey actually passed along the bracelet he had Travis's name on the bracelet
[02:43:27] he'd worn for the past 10 years especially as he says with 10 year anniversary coming up
[02:43:32] hey talked about you know the backstory is from Columbus Ohio he joined Lima Company
[02:43:41] then meant Travis and the rest of the Marines in January 2007 as they rotated in to work with
[02:43:47] the Iraqi Army counterparts at the time I hit my two-year mark in the core but it not yet
[02:43:55] have an opportunity to work with a true leader with so many with so few Marines assigned to the
[02:44:02] mid team Travis's my team leader Travis was a true leader and someone that was easy for me to look
[02:44:07] up to and respect he had the perfect balance of caring for his Marines without babying them
[02:44:13] discipline without being too harsh being laid back we're not involved in missions
[02:44:19] while standing while still leading from the front once it got time to get to work done and we talked
[02:44:25] about that as I progressed through my military career Travis was a leader that strived to be
[02:44:35] your son said the example of how a leader should be I read the book and enjoyed learning
[02:44:42] more about him as a man not just the Marine I also enjoyed getting to know Brendan
[02:44:46] and they're incredibly rare friendship it made it easy for me to connect how he was as a person
[02:44:52] back home and how he was raised so he said I wanted to share two stories so I hit the highlights of this
[02:44:59] but first story he found Connie humorous and he talked about Travis having to sense humor so
[02:45:07] here you go it's February they're out the patrol turn out to be un-eventsful for the most part
[02:45:14] until they started return to the alpose as they were returning an idea it was initiated and
[02:45:23] ambush started thankfully the idea did not detonate the artillery show it was attached to
[02:45:29] but only the blasting cap and nose of the shell blue this injured his soldier
[02:45:37] and another Iraqi soldier was shot while rushing to the aid
[02:45:41] both were non life threatening once the ambush started I began to radio and back to request QFR
[02:45:49] although Travis was not on the patrol he managed to find a way to get on the QFR to QRF team
[02:45:56] as a short ambush subsided the QRF showed up Travis's presence comma any nerves that I had
[02:46:03] the injured Iraqi had already taken back to receive treatment would I remember most about the situation
[02:46:11] was that Travis always about Travis that brings a smile on my face I was standing on the north side
[02:46:17] of the road and Travis was on the south I remember he began to cross the road in a jog just as an
[02:46:22] Iraqi soldier let about a burst of his AK to the east to stop a vehicle from approaching
[02:46:28] as soon as the burst went off Travis trip across the road doing a barrel roll and coming back to his feet
[02:46:35] with his helmet push back on his head as soon as he reached me on the north side of the road he said
[02:46:40] is everybody okay over here I replied yes sir everyone is okay are you okay sir
[02:46:47] to which he responded yeah but somebody should get that pod hole fix
[02:46:51] and a near death experience for me this part of a laughter as my leader had just
[02:46:59] stopped been startled by an Iraqi army warning shot causing the fall and barrel roll in the middle
[02:47:03] of Iraq history so having that sense of humor right they were left at yourself and then the other
[02:47:09] story shared is is about this guy's birthday my second story of Travis is more sentimental
[02:47:15] my birthday is April 3rd and turning 21 that night we all slated we're slated for overnight
[02:47:23] observation searching for posby dees but I've been pulled from the mission to remain behind
[02:47:28] I thought nothing of it went to bed on the second ready to be on the QQRF in case anything
[02:47:35] were to happen admit night I was woken up and told I needed to go to the COC because they were
[02:47:41] requesting me over the radio I shook the cobwebs from my head and walked to the COC after
[02:47:46] calling to the patrol on the radio I was greeted with Travis Travis's voice in a whisper
[02:47:51] simply to wish me a happy birthday throughout the madness of the trolling stand week all night
[02:47:57] and searching for IDs he had kept me in mind and as soon as the day transition from the second
[02:48:02] to the third he called over the radio to wish me a happy birthday a week later I left Iraq
[02:48:08] the mid team and Travis I will never forget that I'll never forget him yeah so
[02:48:16] you know I just received this the other day and you know still hear from guys that he served with
[02:48:21] and just little things that you know caring about your people having a good sense of humor
[02:48:28] leadership traits that we can all use
[02:48:32] crazy hell these themes they just they're coming you hear everywhere as far as good leaders you
[02:48:41] know like all the good leaders they have these themes that dichotomy like you got to be strict
[02:48:46] but you can't be like a slave driver you know it's that balancing act I guess that's why
[02:48:51] there's just a few leaders because it's so hard to do you know it's like some people think
[02:48:56] I'm just gonna go I'm an extreme guy you know I'm gonna go extreme but it's not like that
[02:49:00] even a guy with an extreme personality like Travis who can push himself that hard to be a
[02:49:06] national level wrestler understands leadership to a point where he knows what it means to call back
[02:49:12] to base while you're out on patrol and wish a happy birthday to one of your men yeah yeah
[02:49:18] it's just awesome it's a good way to put it to echo it's a it's a balancing act you know for
[02:49:23] for everyone it's sort of figured out you know it's not one one situation for everyone you know
[02:49:31] well sir thanks again for for coming on the show and ensuring this story
[02:49:40] thank you for your service in the Marine Corps and of course thank you for raising such
[02:49:47] an incredible man and marine and hero and son and once again we see another another
[02:50:06] another tale another legend of bravery and of sacrifice from these two heroic leaders
[02:50:20] but I still want to remind everyone as always that these are not
[02:50:24] imagined legends or myths then these aren't symbolic stories that were made up
[02:50:37] to reinforce some ancient parable these are the lives of men
[02:50:46] real men who stepped up and stepped forward and gave everything for us and in that sacrifice
[02:51:07] we see the unmeasurable suffering of the families rock with pain and yet filled with pride
[02:51:23] to have known and to have absorbed the light and the love that these men emanated
[02:51:37] in life a light that will not fade and will not grow old like the flesh
[02:51:50] a light that will guide us all down the righteous path toward the good regardless of the cost
[02:52:06] for them we hold our heads higher and do our best to make the world a better place
[02:52:24] like they did
[02:52:25] we will do our utmost to emulate Brendan Looney we will be strong we will be accountable
[02:52:41] we will not complain and in the most trying of times we will ask ourselves a simple question
[02:52:52] the same one the Travis manion asked when he faced the darkness of the world
[02:53:05] if not me then who
[02:53:18] can
[02:53:32] out.
