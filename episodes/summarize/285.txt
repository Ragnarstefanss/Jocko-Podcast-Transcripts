Next section action of strategy how is the strategic dislocation produced in the physical or logistical sphere it is the result of a move which a upsets the enemies dispositions and by compelling a sudden change of front dislocates the distribution and organization of his forces be separates his forces kind of got a little little little little tingle in my spine when I saw that and dangers his supplies de-menaces the root or roots by which he could retreat in case of need and reestablish himself on the base so this there's these ways that we can cause strategic dislocation a dislocation may be produced by one of these effects but is more often a consequence of several right we're going to we're going to dislocate them from multiple different directions differentiation indeed is difficult because a move directed toward the enemies rear tends to combine these effects their respective influence however varies and has varied throughout history according the size of armaged and complexities of their organization with armies which live on the country drawing their supplies locally by plunder or requisition the line of communication has negligible importance so if you got an army that's out there living off the land they kind of know what they're doing you can't you can't really cut their supply lines because they don't have any even if a higher even in a higher stage of military development the smaller a force the less dependent it is on the lines of communication for supplies for larger an army and more complex its organization the more prompt and serious in effect is a menace to its line of communication so depending on who you're fighting you gotta make some adjustments where armies have not been so dependent strategies been correspondingly handicapped and the technically issue of battle has played a greater part nevertheless even thus handicapped able strategists have frequently gained a decisive advantage previous to battle by menacing the enemies lines of retreat the equilibrium of his dispositions or his local supplies so we're doing so we're we're throwing people off the spy mess and we're just supply chain by messing with their communication and by the way I'm probably gonna mention it's 15 15 thousand more times he's talking all the time about disrupting your enemies communication each one of those is the red cell the red team for us to go man am I communicating properly every time you hear that's one of the main ways that the indirect approach works is by disrupting the enemy communication what is that tell us about our communication it tells us it's freaking critical he goes into some some talk about how to disrupt communication to be effective such a menace usually must be applied at a point closer in time and space to the enemy's army than a menace to his communication and thus early in warfare it's often difficult to distinguish between strategic and tactical maneuver in the psychological sphere dislocation is the result of the impression on the commander's mind of the physical effects which we have listed the impression is strongly accentuated if his realization of being at a disadvantage is sudden and if he feels that he is unable to counter an enemy's move psychological dislocation fundamentally springs from his sense of being trapped that's straight out of like the jujitsu world and this is important so we feel we feel dislocated we feel nervous when we get trapped guess what you should never do as a leader the purpose of this distraction is to deprive the enemy of his freedom of action and it should operate both the physical and psychological fear spheres in the physical it should cause a distension of his forces or their diversion to unprofit lens of that they are too widely distributed and to commit it elsewhere who's exactly what D.A. was to have the power of interfering with one's own decisively intended move which was we're going to hit it in the psychological fear sphere the same effect is sought by playing upon the fears this the fears of and by deceiving the opposing command stone wall jacks an athlete of expressed this in his strategic gomato mystify mislead and surprise for to mystify and mislead constitutes distraction while surprise is the essential cause of dislocation is through the distraction of the commander's mind that the distraction of his forces follows the loss of his freedom of action is the sequel to the loss of his freedom of conception a more profound appreciation of how the psychological permeates and dominates the physical fear sphere has an indirect value for it warns us of the fallacy and shallowness of attempting to analyze and theorize about strategy in terms of mathematics to treat it quantitatively as if the issue turned merely on superior concentration of force at a selected place is as faulty as to treat it geometrically as a matter of lines and angles not just numbers even more remote from the truth because in practice it usually leads to a dead end is the tendency of textbooks to treat war as mainly a matter of concentrating superior force in his celebrated definition of economy of force fock termed this the art of pouring out all one's resources at a given moment on one spot of making use there of all truths and to make such a thing possible of making those troops permanently communicate with each other instead of dividing them and attaching to each fraction some fixed in invariable function its second part a result having been attained is the art of again so disposing the troops as to converge upon and act against a single new objective and quote it would have been so there's the there's the economy force like hey we're going to put all of our forces in the right spot at the right time which we all know we learn that all the time and that's part of prioritize an execute that is part of prioritize an execute is listen you got multiple things you need to concentrate your forces on unobjective efficiently it would have been more exact and he's kind of take upon a little a little hit on this quote from from fock who by the way this is burden and a burden and fock this is the the French allied commander world war one and it is difficult to decide exactly where a strategic movement ends and a tactical movement begins yet in conception the two are distinct tactics lies in the fills tactics lies and fills the province of fighting strategy not only stops on the frontier but has for its purpose the reduction of fighting by the slendorist possible proportions so the purpose of strategies to not fight because on with the aim of strategy this statement may be disputed by those who conceive the destruction of the enemies armed force as the only sound aim in war who hold that the only goal of strategy is battle and who obsessed with the clouds vizzi and saying that blood is the price of victory yet if one should concede this point and meet its advocates on their own ground the statement would remain unshaken for even if decisive battle be the goal the aim of strategy must be to bring about this battle under the most advantageous circumstances and the more advantageous the circumstances the less proportionally will be the fighting so whole goal of strategies we're not fighting that's what we're doing the perfection of strategy would be therefore to produce a decision without any serious fighting history now think about that from a leadership perspective I never get an argument because Dave's doing what I need him to do to make it happen that's the most effective strategy it's not how do I outwit David and argument that doesn't matter why am I having an argument history as we have seen provides examples where strategy help by favorable conditions has virtually produced such a result and he goes through some examples here and again he's recalling back to some of the examples that he talks about in the book while these cases where the destruction of the enemy's forces the enemies armed forces was economically achieved through the disarming by surrender such destruction may not be essential for a decision and for the fulfillment of the war aim in the case of a state that is seeking not conquest but maintenance of its security the aim is fulfilled if the threat be removed if the enemy is led to abandon his purpose with such while such blood this victories have been exceptional their rarity enhances rather than detracts from their value as an indication of latent potentialities in strategy and grand strategy despite many centuries of experience of war we have hardly begun to explore the field of psychological warfare from deep study of war clouse fits was led to the conclusion that quote all military action is permeated by intelligent forces and their effects nevertheless and quote nevertheless nations at war have always driven or been driven by their passions to disregard the implications of such a conclusion instead of applying intelligence they have chosen to batter their heads against the nearest wall so here's Karlswick's like oh here we go let's see what what jacco's gonna try to do to me this time talking about loyalty and respect and the things that you actually want from me in the end you know when when when you're the leader that likes to set your people up so you can hammer them dude that's a classic like I won that argument cool and that argument man I don't have to even like a gypshoon that meeting good job he won't want to step up again this is the reason why it is most frequently followed a physical move on the enemy's rear an army like a man cannot properly defend its back from a blow without turning around to use its arms in a new direction turning temporarily unbalances an army as it does a man and with the former the period of instability is inevitably much longer in consequence the brain is much more sensitive to any menace to its back this is why in jacco what are we trying to do we're trying to attack the back that's why in the battlefield we're trying to we're trying to come around to the rear because they have to maneuver and face you and they're exposed in contrast to move directly on an opponent consolidates his balance physical and psychologically and by consolidating it increases his resisting power when I attack you from the front you know exactly what's that coming at you and you can resist it more what does that mean from the leadership perspective that means that I I don't want to have you resist my ideas by coming right at you for in the case of an army it rolls the enemy back towards the reserve supplies and reinforcement what are we accomplished and that that next level up to grand strategy and of course I think the connection he's making is on this large scale man I literally took a class called American grand strategy and the military is a is a component of all these other things you named a bunch of them diplomatic you know uh uh uh eacon obviously it's a whole bunch of different tools that are inside there that are actually you know they're all connected but the military is one arm of that one of many of course you're in uniform you think the whole world of all's round military power we know we say it all the time we know that's not true but an example that you use we all the time and in just trying to explain this idea of utilizing resources and making decisions when you talk about means our means everybody has limited means we don't have unlimited means or unlimited resources and if I'm looking at this particular area that I want to open up a shop here open up a couple of locations and this physical you know this geographic area to compete with our uh competitors and I take all of my resources every penny I've got every tool I've got and we gotta look out for that it rests normally with the government responsible for the grand strategy of awarded decide whether strategy should make its contribution by achieving a military decision or otherwise just as military means is only one of the means to the end of grand strategy one of the instruments in the surgeon's case so battle is only one of the means to the end of strategy if the conditions are suitable it usually it is usually the quickest and effect but if conditions are unfavorable it's a folly to use so cool you can go to battle but if you haven't prepared for it and you don't have the advantage it's stupid let's assume that a strategist is empowered to seek a military decision his responsibility is to seek it under the most advantageous circumstances in order to produce the most profitable result hence his true aim is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation so advantageous that if it does not of itself produce the decision its continuation by battle is sure to achieve this so we're not engaging in battles that we don't know we're gonna win and if we know we're gonna win them why can't we convince them opponent that we're gonna win and they bow down in other words dislocation is the aim of strategy it's sequel maybe either the enemy's dissolution or his easier disruption in battle dissolution may involve some partial measure of fighting but this is not but this is not the character of battle so that's what we're trying to do we're trying to win the fight without fighting we're trying to win the argument without having it I'm trying to get Dave what I to do what I wanted to do without him even knowing that that's what I want to do it's with his idea you know there's four bushes three of them are pretty good one of them socks go to the one that sucks in studying the physical aspect we must never lose sight of those psychological and when both are combined is the strategy truly an indirect approach calculated dislocate the opponent's balance the mere action of marching indirectly toward the enemy and on the rear of his dispositions is not constituted the strategic indirect approach so just because you try and come around the rear doesn't mean because if that's what they think you're going to do it doesn't matter strategic card is not so simple such an approach may start by being an indirect relation to an enemy's front but by the very directness of its progress towards the rear may allow the enemy to change his dispositions so that soon becomes a direct approach on a new front check because of the risk that the enemy may achieve such a change of front it is usually necessary for the dislocating move to be preceded by a move or moves which can best be defined as the term distract in a literal sense to draw a sunder so we have to do multiple moves just like in jujitsu you can't just do one move you can't recently you can't really even just do two you got to do multiple moves to make the enemy not sure what's really important what's really going on and you know I was I was doing a little bit of research because I always people will sometimes bring up d day what about d day front all assault it's only a frontal assault if the enemy recognizes this is a frontal assault and then lines up his defenses against that frontal assault and the psychology of that the human nature reaction is the thing that actually matters the most is your response to my interaction and if you think it's a frontal assault they're going to react like it's a frontal assault and you're going to dig in and it was like something's going something's going on here and like actually it's a frontal assault you don't know it's a you made our job easier at the most it imposes a strain rather than producing a shock thus a move around the enemy's rear against the move around the enemy's front against his rear has the aim not only avoiding resistance on its way but in its issue in the profound distance it takes the line of least resistance the equivalent in this psychological sphere is the line of least expectation they are two faces of the same coin this is to widen our understanding of strategy if we merely take what obviously appears the line of least resistance its obviousness will appeal to the opponent also and this line may no longer be the line of least resistance used it when we used to go on weak hands reconnaissance missions and we'd get put on reconnaissance missions like I camp penaltent and you get up to camp penaltent and you're supposed to be observing some area and there's a one spot to observe there's like one bush you're like we can it's so tempting to go to that bush we guess exactly where the they're going to look they're going to look at that bush so you're better off digging a hole doing whatever you got to do taking the worst looking bush so if you want to learn about leadership go there we got courses on there we're doing live stuff all the time we're doing live stuff all the time you want to ask me a question go there all answer your question and I'll actually dig down and Dave will come in off the top roads label be flanking the whole situation like we're there and we have the monster we just got done with Orlando next monster is Phoenix in August August 17th and 18th Las Vegas October 28th and 29th go to extremownership.com everything we've done is sold out so if you want to come go and register we also have EF battlefield we also hate EF battlefield we don't have one on the calendar right now the next thing we do have on the calendar is FTX where you're going to put on gear laser tag gear we have this high speed laser tag system and you're going to run operations and learn these leadership lessons the next one we're doing is in San Diego, Diego right here in SD July 12 from 13th back to the book a true all this is a true adjustment would establish a perfect economy of force in the deeper sense of that off distorted military term so all the time we heard the term you know economy of force but because of the nature and uncertainty of war and uncertainty increased by lack of scientific study even the greatest military ability could not achieve a true adjustment and success lies in the closest approximation to the truth again his use the word truth is a little bit is a little bit broad but what he's talking about is like how much should I apply to this how much force should I apply we want to apply the minimum force required But second of all it's important because what he's saying is you should constantly be assessing if if the juice is worked the squeeze you should constantly be saying like listen we're going to put this much effort towards this client or going to put this much effort towards this relationship we're going to put this much effort towards this team who's we don't know how they're going to do so you constantly have to check yourself if the end that you're going towards is your investment worth it. she's got a charity organization doing all kinds of great work for veterans will the main thing she's doing is getting medical treatments for our vets that maybe aren't being covered by the VA if you want to donate or you want to get involved go to america's mighty warriors dot org and if you want more of my protracted pontifications we need more of echoes misplaced meandering or perhaps even more of Dave's animated additions you can find us on the inner webs on Twitter on the Graham and on Facebook echoes at equitros Dave is at David art Burke and I am at juggle willing and to the military service men and women out there thank you for putting the strategy of freedom in detectics and keeping the world from darkness same goes to our police and law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMTs dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service and all first responders thanks for keeping the world safe from evil here at home and everyone else out there the direct approach is not as direct as you think to think again and maybe maybe just try taking the long way around because the long way around you might find out ends up being the shortest distance between two points until next time this is Dave and echo in juggle out like hey we got patent he's going to come in this other spot and and so for seven weeks the Nazis were like no don't commit so even though it was they looked like a direct assault there was a massive fake going on that that Germany didn't commit their forces for seven weeks that's crazy so it looked like a frontal assault I get it Next section elements and conditions in strategy however calculation is simpler and a closer approximation to truth possible than in tactics so this is a very interesting point it's easier to calculate big broad strategic things because you're a little bit further away from the human component for an war the chief and calculs is human will which manifests itself in resistance which in turn lies in the province of tactics strategy has not to overcome resistance except from nature its purposes to diminish the possibility of resistance and it seeks to fulfill this purpose by exploiting the elements of movement and surprise now that's cool and everything I would say that there's definitely that's a stretch because we've seen collect the collective will of a people change the outcome of strategic situations for sure so even though I said hey it's it's closer to it still can have a huge impact I mean look at Vietnam it was like yeah like I said we had got E-Munity stuff as well cold war uh vitamin D3 boom take that all guarantee your path would be a little bit easier versus if you don't take that we're not getting sick all of a sudden thank you which we like you can get this you get the drinks at wall wall by the way on the east coast if you're on the east coast you're gonna wall walk get yourself you can clear out shelves whatever that's kind of like what we're doing sanction really sanctioned authorized well well now I've used a bunch of energy didn't work and how often am I going to do that so we have to be careful and what he's saying is you want to use it's what we talk a lot about a lot about edescalum front which is minimum force required well like how much force do I need to use to get you to react and if if I only have to use you know 10% of my force over here to get you to react that means I have 90% of my force to finish you finish the job on the flank closing this out superior weight at the intended decisive point does not suffice unless that point cannot be reinforced in time by the opponent so there's the physical sphere sphere of movement surprise lies in the psychological sphere and depends on a calculation of far more difficult than in the physical sphere of the manifold conditions varying in each case which are likely to affect the will of the opponent so you got two things you've got movement and you've got surprise this is how we're gonna kind of win this is how we're gonna win by movement and surprise movement physical surprise psychological although strategy may a more at exploiting movement than at exploiting surprise or conversely the two elements react on each other so even though they're different spheres they're still closely woven together movement generates surprise and surprise gives impetus to movement so this is jujitsu and I used to tell this the young seals is a doctrinal term called supporting distance and what supporting distance is you Dave and me your platoon and my platoon or your company and my company or your battalion and my battalion we aren't gonna get so far apart that we can't support each other so that means if if we only have rifles we're gonna be 400 500 yards from each other you know depending on the terrain if the terrain is you know mountainous or we might be closer than that because I want to be able to provide support to you if we have mortars cool now we can stretch it out a little bit more if we have our teller we can stretch it out even more but we need to be able to cover and move for each other we need to be able to support each other and if we get too far apart you're alone man we had a term that we got to coin it was called fluid mutual support which is we when you say we got to coin this expand bro but he's dressed up like a like a nom seal straight up just wearing jeans just straight up that's what he's in the case you know the glass case right like a like a like a action figure And going going into this, this particular book, books, series of books, articles, individual, the more I read over the years, it got better and better and kept getting better and kept making more sense to me from a tactical battle war perspective, from a leadership perspective, from a how-to lead perspective and also, contraryly like a red cell type, how not to lead, from a relationship leadership, capital perspective and a Jockel perspective. oh it's coming question and even from leaders like I'm afraid to address this it's like at all the time about face hack worth we talked about it today and then extreme ownership and the dichotomy and leadership we have a leadership consultant consultancy we saw problems through leadership if you want to check that out go to echelonfront.com we have online training as well it's like a leadership gym right with trainers and I don't know in the end who's going to get the kill or who's going to be the reason why I'm successful but you're going to have to react to something and if you don't one of those different arms those different supporting elements will eventually be the thing that causes you to lose supporting distance covered move and and now fluid mutual support we better I'm going to do it that one about the 13 year old kids right the teacher trying to control the class right like sometimes they're kind of kind of crazy sometimes but it's like man they kind of get crazy like what do I do how do I deal with that man that was a good one These small little things, these little, those things add up over time, as opposed to like somehow the objective is we're going to have a force on force, you know, culminating event between some military and the American military, which, which, again, generically speaking, nobody wants that. and we're just going to go by force that's what course that should be there's six seven eight twelve other components that I can utilize as a leader to make something happen and the worst one to use the one that cost me the most leadership capital is the military one which is my rank which is hey on the boss you should you listen to me to to compel someone through the threat of force as you're only tool to get them to comply the threat of force and even you know the the the moral high ground I mean how convenient would it be if you and I are in a situation looking at something and mine was the moral approach and yours is the immoral approach which requires no money no time no resources no equipment to go so hey if you want to get to if you want to listen to that we set this up because we need to have some kind of an alternative platform in case in case in case what well contingencies happen what if what if some of these platforms decide to start charging you money what if some of these platforms decide to start interjecting their own advertisements into them what if they just straight up censor us because they don't like what we're talking about any of these things could happen if those things happen we wanted to have our own backup plan so we have one jockel underground.com it costs $8 and $18 cents a month through support the cause and if you can't afford it no factor we're the reason this isn't like well you know what you're saying right now is actually a pretty big deal like if you think about if you think about the the fact that someone right now is like well they're drinking three energy drinks a day this obviously not something this guy was thinking about when I think about flying and stealth airplanes the psychology of that is what I what I have discovered and it's true not just an airplane and true in every situation more often than not people's reaction to being surprised is not the right reaction they don't usually react well even when they react it's still like an overreaction under reaction think about how you react it when you're surprised are those usually like good smooth effective responses 100% I don't think I can kick your ass, but you know what, Echo is going to be here in a little while and in the meantime, I'm going to entice, I'm going to go, hey, hey Dean, go get a couple rounds. now so if you want that you know the deal if you want that first the dish leader substraging attack is field manual the code the evaluation the protocol is discipline is freedom field manual way the word or kid want to three and four about face we talked about it today Mikey and the dragons freaking the dragons it's incredible how often I have to talk about Mikey on the Mikey the dragons I'm going to explain that story to adults because people are coming afraid to do this I'm afraid to do that it's is it worth me expanding this leadership capital on getting gave to follow my order on getting gave to you know pick up a client that I know is going to be painful and I'm forcing them to do it and whatever whatever the case may be is it worth that leadership capital we we have to weigh that out and you know when you were talking about no you got to go to the gym what how's your leadership going to get better how's your leadership just going to even stay at a good level got to go to the leadership gym that's what we've got And that mentality of mass, which is what it is, premier, a principles, is like, hey, we're going to get, I have more people than you, I'm going to win, which as we know, when we compare that to the, principles behind light infantry, it's not what we're looking for. and then we'll we'll do the next on the next podcast here's where he's going to break down Fox statement a little bit he says wind because Fox said the art of pouring all one's resources so so ladel hard says the concentrate all is an unrealizable ideal and dangerous even as a hyperbole moreover in practice the minimum necessary maybe a far larger portion of the total than maximum possible they would even be true to say that the larger the force that is effectively used for distraction of the enemy the greater the chance of the concentration succeeding in its aim for otherwise it may strike an object to solid to be shattered this is like um in jujitsu if you if I try and sweep you and if you're interested in a little discount little free shipping little not having to worry about remembering to make sure you're always stopped get the subscription path just got a little leave your easier even if the path just got to leave an easier we're efficient remembering we're not worried about it more efficient when how we can focus on something else you know no distraction technically it's BH little delheart it would be Actually, like when you hear people prepping for the the direct assault, which is, I'm now going to let you know and even the preparation for that, just that phrase alone puts the other person in a position where all they want to do is defend themselves. It doesn't mean we say, oh, we're going to change this objective or we're not going to continue to, it means we adjust our approach and maybe instead of going direct, we go indirect. she's like that was really good like that the finished a book in a day in two readings like two settings uh speaks volumes that's good deal it's good The physical factors go all over the place because we got machine guns, we got tanks, we got people with night vision, like it's, there's different physical things but the, but the human nature doesn't change. Ragland I'm assuming you got some steak or something like this it's not like you're like starving and hungry after the steak you just want some things I go you go and your job is a wingman and how I grated your performance as a wingman as how well you stayed inside that what we called visual visual visual sports and if you lost sight of me believe me we you were going to hear about in the debrief and what we evolved to was because of inferior equipment we had to actually get farther away from each other so in simple as terms we could figure out who is the person who is the aircraft in the formation that was fundamentally the most at risk or the most likely to be engaged and the other aircraft could then flank or maneuver or come in from a different three-dimensional direction to support that person and it was fluid because it changed it wasn't exactly on the 35 degree bearing line at five miles it evolved based on weather based on weapons based in the formation and just like you described it And he was kind of maneuvering and getting people to think in a different way of different way of using air power or different way of using tank power or different way of using maneuver warfare. And even what that means, like, if I have an idea, that's different than me like trying to get you to understand some sort of like, hey, two plus two is four. Yeah, and it boils down to, and I know you like when I say this Dave, it becomes not just a theory, not just a strategy, but a way of thinking, a way of thinking. and by the way you can subscribe to this podcast you can also check out jocco unraveling which I'm doing with their all Cooper we're going hard in the paint with that one we got the grounded podcast we got the warrior kid podcast which I know all right let's let's roll into a little little quick activity with you know maybe a little bit of support sure you know
