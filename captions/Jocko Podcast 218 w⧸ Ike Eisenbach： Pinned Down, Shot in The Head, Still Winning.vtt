1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.46
This is Jockel Pondcast number 2-18.

2
00:00:03.46 --> 00:00:06.34
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

3
00:00:06.34 --> 00:00:07.14
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.14 --> 00:00:09.14
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.14 --> 00:00:16.18
In the Marine Corps, in Vietnam, first and second,

6
00:00:16.18 --> 00:00:25.86
we tend to make up about 65% of the Marine officers killed in action.

7
00:00:25.86 --> 00:00:28.10
Now, if you add captains,

8
00:00:28.10 --> 00:00:30.24
Marine Corps captains, oh, threes onto that,

9
00:00:30.24 --> 00:00:36.24
you get to about 85% of all Marine officers killed in Vietnam,

10
00:00:36.24 --> 00:00:42.84
we're in these relatively junior ranking officers.

11
00:00:42.84 --> 00:00:48.52
These were the platoon and company commanders.

12
00:00:48.52 --> 00:00:53.36
And if you go to 1968, 1968 was the year with the highest number

13
00:00:53.36 --> 00:00:58.000
of Americans killed in action in Vietnam.

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.34
16,899.

15
00:01:03.94 --> 00:01:12.62
That's over 1400 per month, 1400 per month killed in action.

16
00:01:12.62 --> 00:01:17.26
Now, to put that in perspective, a little bit

17
00:01:17.26 --> 00:01:21.22
during the heaviest fighting, when I was in Iraq,

18
00:01:21.22 --> 00:01:27.96
which was in 2006, there was 823 Americans killed.

19
00:01:27.96 --> 00:01:42.26
Now, obviously, every single loss is a tragedy.

20
00:01:42.26 --> 00:01:51.86
But during the Vietnam War, the tragedy was 20x that number.

21
00:01:51.86 --> 00:02:02.40
20 times more people killed in 1968 in Vietnam than there were in Iraq in 2006.

22
00:02:02.40 --> 00:02:05.40
That is just a different level.

23
00:02:05.40 --> 00:02:16.14
Now, in total in Vietnam, there were 14,836 Marines killed.

24
00:02:16.14 --> 00:02:21.98
187 of those were officers.

25
00:02:21.98 --> 00:02:29.26
So that's basically 10% of the Marines killed were officers.

26
00:02:29.26 --> 00:02:34.86
And as I already said, 85% of more of these junior officers.

27
00:02:34.86 --> 00:02:39.04
Now, if you just run that mouth out a little bit,

28
00:02:39.04 --> 00:02:45.04
there's generally around going to be one officer in an infantry

29
00:02:45.04 --> 00:02:50.38
group, and there's going to be around 40 guys, which means that these officers

30
00:02:50.38 --> 00:02:57.62
make up for about 2.5% of Marines.

31
00:02:57.62 --> 00:03:02.56
And then, again, just by my estimation, just some rough math,

32
00:03:02.56 --> 00:03:09.12
that means that these young Marine officers were about four times more likely to be

33
00:03:09.12 --> 00:03:15.44
killed than the enlisted guys.

34
00:03:15.44 --> 00:03:23.32
And if you think about that, you wonder, why is that?

35
00:03:23.32 --> 00:03:24.32
How's that happen?

36
00:03:24.32 --> 00:03:32.36
Well, from a tactical perspective, first of all, the enemy knows what I say all the time

37
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:37.16
and that is that leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

38
00:03:37.16 --> 00:03:42.92
Because of that, the enemy aims to kill the leaders.

39
00:03:42.92 --> 00:03:50.32
And then on top of that, Marine officers are trained to be the first one on the ground,

40
00:03:50.32 --> 00:03:55.60
the first one that's off the helicopter, the first one that's out of the vehicle.

41
00:03:55.60 --> 00:03:59.56
The first one in the combat situation, and then the last to leave, the last to load the

42
00:03:59.56 --> 00:04:02.04
helicopter, the last to get inside of an APC.

43
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:05.64
So right there, your chance is go up, because you're in it longer.

44
00:04:05.64 --> 00:04:10.52
And that might only be an extra 30 seconds, but those moments when you're inserting your

45
00:04:10.52 --> 00:04:18.72
extracting from the battlefield, those are the most critically dangerous moments usually.

46
00:04:18.72 --> 00:04:23.92
And then on top of all that, you add to the fact that as an officer, you generally

47
00:04:23.92 --> 00:04:29.80
lead from somewhere near the front of the patrol, maybe you're behind the point man,

48
00:04:29.80 --> 00:04:34.28
maybe you're behind the point man in the first automatic weapons gunner.

49
00:04:34.28 --> 00:04:40.76
And since you're in the front of the patrol, well, that increases your exposure to

50
00:04:40.76 --> 00:04:41.76
booby traps.

51
00:04:41.76 --> 00:04:46.64
It increases your exposure to ambushes.

52
00:04:46.64 --> 00:04:54.80
And then, of course, on top of all those things, when the time comes, you actually have

53
00:04:54.80 --> 00:04:57.000
to lead.

54
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You actually have to step up.

55
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.24
You actually have to make decisions.

56
00:04:59.24 --> 00:05:05.84
You actually have to get your men to maneuver on the battlefield.

57
00:05:05.84 --> 00:05:07.000
That's what your job is.

58
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:19.24
And by the way, that job description is not just some theoretical job description.

59
00:05:19.24 --> 00:05:30.08
This is what the young Marine officers in Vietnam actually did.

60
00:05:30.08 --> 00:05:41.92
And here's an example of what a young Marine Corps officer did in Vietnam.

61
00:05:41.92 --> 00:05:45.84
The president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the silver

62
00:05:45.84 --> 00:05:53.20
star to second lieutenant Charles Robert Eisenberg, United States Marine Corps.

63
00:05:53.20 --> 00:05:59.68
For conspicuous, gallantry, and interpetity in action while serving as Platoon Commander

64
00:05:59.68 --> 00:06:05.08
with company D, first reconnaissance battalion, first Marine Division, FMF, in connection

65
00:06:05.08 --> 00:06:10.88
with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam.

66
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:20.20
In 4 July 1968, the second lieutenant Eisenberg was leading a reconnaissance patrol.

67
00:06:20.20 --> 00:06:24.52
When the units suddenly came under intense small arms and automatic weapons fire from

68
00:06:24.52 --> 00:06:33.72
a numerically superior North Vietnamese army force and the lead elements were pinned down.

69
00:06:33.72 --> 00:06:36.96
Realizing the seriousness of the situation, he immediately directed the remainder of his

70
00:06:36.96 --> 00:06:42.88
men to maneuver to aid the beleaguered Marines while he fearlessly moved forward to direct

71
00:06:42.88 --> 00:06:44.88
the fire of his men.

72
00:06:44.88 --> 00:06:50.20
Ignoring the enemy fire impacting around him, he moved about the fire swept terrain, deploying

73
00:06:50.20 --> 00:06:56.56
his men into advantage of firing positions and directing their fire until he was seriously

74
00:06:56.56 --> 00:06:59.000
wounded.

75
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.72
Although he was partially paralyzed and unable to move, he continued to direct his men while

76
00:07:03.72 --> 00:07:08.68
simultaneously adjusting air strikes and supporting artillery fire upon the hostile

77
00:07:08.68 --> 00:07:11.56
positions.

78
00:07:11.56 --> 00:07:16.40
Disregarding his painful injury, he resolutely controlled his unit throughout the remainder

79
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:19.88
of the firefight.

80
00:07:19.88 --> 00:07:25.36
His heroic and timely actions were an inspiration to all who observed him and contributed

81
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:31.20
significantly to the accomplishment of his unit's mission.

82
00:07:31.20 --> 00:07:36.20
He encouraged the leadership and unwavering devotion to duty and the face of great personal

83
00:07:36.20 --> 00:07:37.20
danger.

84
00:07:37.20 --> 00:07:44.12
Second Lieutenant Eisenberg upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United

85
00:07:44.12 --> 00:07:52.60
States Naval Service.

86
00:07:52.60 --> 00:08:03.48
Now when you hear an award write up like that, you kind of have to ask yourself, who

87
00:08:03.48 --> 00:08:08.72
are these men, where did these men come from?

88
00:08:08.72 --> 00:08:19.56
Where did they learn this level of courage and bravery?

89
00:08:19.56 --> 00:08:23.56
Where did they learn to lead?

90
00:08:23.56 --> 00:08:29.44
There is an honor to say that today we have one of those men with us.

91
00:08:29.44 --> 00:08:37.68
As a matter of fact, we have that man, the man who's silver star citation, I just read

92
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:44.44
his name is Charles Robert Eisenberg or Ike as he was known.

93
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:52.68
He's here to share his story so that we can learn some of the lessons from him about

94
00:08:52.68 --> 00:08:55.40
leadership and about life.

95
00:08:55.40 --> 00:08:58.88
Ike, thanks for coming on, appreciate it.

96
00:08:58.88 --> 00:08:59.88
My pleasure.

97
00:08:59.88 --> 00:09:03.000
Great to meet you.

98
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.80
And luckily, your son and your daughter put together a bunch of information kind of a timeline

99
00:09:10.80 --> 00:09:15.56
of your life which made it really easy for me to prepare for this podcast because that's

100
00:09:15.56 --> 00:09:19.44
normally what I have to go back and do but Matt, appreciate you doing that.

101
00:09:19.44 --> 00:09:21.44
Not a problem.

102
00:09:21.44 --> 00:09:28.20
And it starts off where I always like to start off these podcasts in the beginning.

103
00:09:28.20 --> 00:09:32.12
So sir, let's talk about your childhood.

104
00:09:32.12 --> 00:09:35.44
Let's talk about like what was young Ike doing?

105
00:09:35.44 --> 00:09:37.16
Where did you come from?

106
00:09:37.16 --> 00:09:42.76
But young Ike wasn't around but young Bob was or Bobi because I was Bob or Bobi to the

107
00:09:42.76 --> 00:09:48.16
family before I went in the service and about a week into the Naval Academy pleaps summer

108
00:09:48.16 --> 00:09:53.16
squalid or got us all out one night and gave us nicknamed, some stuck, some didn't.

109
00:09:53.16 --> 00:09:54.16
Ike stuck.

110
00:09:54.16 --> 00:09:59.08
So that's the way that was, but when Bobi was growing up, Bobi's dad was a current

111
00:09:59.08 --> 00:10:00.56
aval officer.

112
00:10:00.56 --> 00:10:04.92
And somewhere just to the right of a till of the hunt, I would say.

113
00:10:04.92 --> 00:10:11.000
He was a hard man but we had an interesting childhood, moved very a couple of years back

114
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.68
and forth the East Coast, West Coast, spent a couple of years in Lima, Peru and ended up

115
00:10:16.68 --> 00:10:21.48
in at Subic Bay in the Philippines graduating from high school out there.

116
00:10:21.48 --> 00:10:23.28
So it was an interesting childhood.

117
00:10:23.28 --> 00:10:26.04
So was he in World War II?

118
00:10:26.04 --> 00:10:27.04
He was.

119
00:10:27.04 --> 00:10:28.04
He was an aval avater.

120
00:10:28.04 --> 00:10:33.84
He out of the Naval Academy class of 36 flew PBYs.

121
00:10:33.84 --> 00:10:36.60
He used to say flying used to be fun.

122
00:10:36.60 --> 00:10:41.68
You know, you put on the silk scarf, go up or 45 minutes or so and said, then somebody

123
00:10:41.68 --> 00:10:47.52
invented this damn PBY which stayed a lot for 12 hours and flying was not so much fun

124
00:10:47.52 --> 00:10:49.96
after that but that's what he did in World War II.

125
00:10:49.96 --> 00:10:55.52
He was in the long a poe and the Philippines when the war broke with his squadron, which

126
00:10:55.52 --> 00:10:58.12
I think was VP 101.

127
00:10:58.12 --> 00:11:04.96
They kind of got out just by the hair, their chini chan chin, worked their way south down

128
00:11:04.96 --> 00:11:12.68
the Philippines Islands to Java, current day Indonesia and then up in Perth, Australia.

129
00:11:12.68 --> 00:11:17.08
From there, I think he came back to the US for about a year and did whatever they did

130
00:11:17.08 --> 00:11:20.36
with the folks in World War II back then.

131
00:11:20.36 --> 00:11:28.48
And went back, picked up a command of a seaplane tender, the sand Pablo and worked his way

132
00:11:28.48 --> 00:11:33.80
back up the specific with my Carthor's group.

133
00:11:33.80 --> 00:11:39.82
I think it was the battle they take golf and I was like, I'm batting because a seaplane

134
00:11:39.82 --> 00:11:42.92
tender isn't that one or two five inch guns.

135
00:11:42.92 --> 00:11:45.20
They didn't go out there and shoot it up with anybody.

136
00:11:45.20 --> 00:11:46.20
We hope not.

137
00:11:46.20 --> 00:11:47.20
No.

138
00:11:47.20 --> 00:11:52.48
Yeah, they carried ab gas and ammunition so that wouldn't have been a pretty picture.

139
00:11:52.48 --> 00:12:00.48
But after World War II came back, he didn't see me until I was a year old, I guess.

140
00:12:00.48 --> 00:12:04.36
I didn't know what I looked like because he said my mom's pictures were just nothing

141
00:12:04.36 --> 00:12:07.16
blur.

142
00:12:07.16 --> 00:12:12.60
So we just picked up the family from there, started moving.

143
00:12:12.60 --> 00:12:18.52
The first step was to burn a couple years later after I was born in Arlington, Virginia.

144
00:12:18.52 --> 00:12:22.92
I said, we'd come back to Car Nautilus once or twice.

145
00:12:22.92 --> 00:12:25.56
Four of them were great.

146
00:12:25.56 --> 00:12:26.56
That's right.

147
00:12:26.56 --> 00:12:28.96
It was the ferry back then.

148
00:12:28.96 --> 00:12:30.20
And that was a big deal.

149
00:12:30.20 --> 00:12:34.24
Of course, when you're a little kid, it was a very fun.

150
00:12:34.24 --> 00:12:37.92
When you're a parent, I guess they're just a pain of the butt because you're trying to get

151
00:12:37.92 --> 00:12:42.68
back and forth to Car Nautilus from San Diego on a time schedule.

152
00:12:42.68 --> 00:12:45.48
So how long did you stay in for?

153
00:12:45.48 --> 00:12:48.76
He was in for 26 years.

154
00:12:48.76 --> 00:12:52.48
How to heart attack out in the field means this last two years.

155
00:12:52.48 --> 00:12:57.88
Back in the sixies of heart attack was, you were just automatic medical retirement.

156
00:12:57.88 --> 00:13:01.04
So they shipped him back to Newport and he was retired.

157
00:13:01.04 --> 00:13:03.16
Probably up about 27 to 28 years.

158
00:13:03.16 --> 00:13:05.68
How old were you at this point?

159
00:13:05.68 --> 00:13:11.16
I was in first year college at the University of Utah when he had his heart attack.

160
00:13:11.16 --> 00:13:14.76
I went into the Naval Academy to follow him here.

161
00:13:14.76 --> 00:13:19.84
So when you were growing up, when you were thinking about, obviously, if you went to the

162
00:13:19.84 --> 00:13:24.04
University of Utah, did you want to go in the Navy at that point?

163
00:13:24.04 --> 00:13:32.60
Well, my dad being my dad, he had prepped me for the Naval Academy.

164
00:13:32.60 --> 00:13:35.64
We visited there when I was younger and everything like that.

165
00:13:35.64 --> 00:13:41.32
When I was about a junior in high school, he would start with the, well, Bob, yeah, what

166
00:13:41.32 --> 00:13:42.32
do you want to do?

167
00:13:42.32 --> 00:13:44.16
I'd be a graduate from high school.

168
00:13:44.16 --> 00:13:46.48
And I didn't have a good answer.

169
00:13:46.48 --> 00:13:48.000
No answer was going to be just right.

170
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.20
I knew what the answer should be.

171
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:54.04
But I went and started to say, well, dad, I think I'm going to go to college.

172
00:13:54.04 --> 00:13:58.24
That kind of satisfied him for a few months and then he came back and said, well, who do

173
00:13:58.24 --> 00:13:59.52
you think is going to pay for that?

174
00:13:59.52 --> 00:14:02.20
Well, I had me stumped for another couple of months.

175
00:14:02.20 --> 00:14:03.20
But it's a fun fact.

176
00:14:03.20 --> 00:14:07.12
Well, I joined your year, I said, dad, you know, I think you're going to pay for it.

177
00:14:07.12 --> 00:14:09.32
And so that's kind of stuff that.

178
00:14:09.32 --> 00:14:11.76
So we're going to have to fill up pains.

179
00:14:11.76 --> 00:14:16.40
Graduates from high school out there had 17 in my graduating class all time high for

180
00:14:16.40 --> 00:14:20.56
a Georgia to do a junior senior high school.

181
00:14:20.56 --> 00:14:24.56
And I still, you know, I wasn't going to go to the Naval Academy.

182
00:14:24.56 --> 00:14:27.92
I said this wasn't in my scheme of things.

183
00:14:27.92 --> 00:14:31.28
So three of us got accepted to the University of Utah.

184
00:14:31.28 --> 00:14:35.32
I went to the University of Utah because it was the one school that accepted me out of high school.

185
00:14:35.32 --> 00:14:37.32
I'm not going to have bad grades or anything.

186
00:14:37.32 --> 00:14:39.28
I had decent grades and good recommendations.

187
00:14:39.28 --> 00:14:46.04
But it's just, you know, the way things worked out and the early 60s, this was 62 when

188
00:14:46.04 --> 00:14:48.28
I graduated from high school.

189
00:14:48.28 --> 00:14:54.16
So three of us went off from our graduating class off to just all like city and where

190
00:14:54.16 --> 00:14:57.24
it's a role of this freshman at the University of Utah.

191
00:14:57.24 --> 00:15:04.000
There was a get together of all the freshman before schools officially started and I don't

192
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.68
know who was up there on the stage.

193
00:15:05.68 --> 00:15:10.76
But he was touting the diversity back then of their entering class.

194
00:15:10.76 --> 00:15:15.16
And so we'd have to stand up and say, and we have three down and hair from the Philippines.

195
00:15:15.16 --> 00:15:16.16
But just stand please.

196
00:15:16.16 --> 00:15:20.88
So that's three green goes kind of stood up because we're looking at like, you're from

197
00:15:20.88 --> 00:15:21.88
the Philippines.

198
00:15:21.88 --> 00:15:22.88
Yeah.

199
00:15:22.88 --> 00:15:23.88
No, yeah.

200
00:15:23.88 --> 00:15:26.16
You know, check me out if we were.

201
00:15:26.16 --> 00:15:28.16
Please, you know, please, me too.

202
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:32.16
Really, well, I thought at the time was quite a funny story.

203
00:15:32.16 --> 00:15:38.000
We, in Utah at the time, you couldn't get anything higher than a 3.2 beer.

204
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.56
But, you know, you couldn't smoke unless you were older than 18.

205
00:15:42.56 --> 00:15:44.60
Was you tickets for a fake culture?

206
00:15:44.60 --> 00:15:49.68
Did they be on the Salt Lake City, please?

207
00:15:49.68 --> 00:15:56.12
But somehow we, deliberated some beer one night and we had a guy in the dorm who had a car.

208
00:15:56.12 --> 00:16:02.000
So we went up to Canyon Road that evening and we're drinking beer up there.

209
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.36
Next thing we know, there's a cop car, but right behind us, not cop, good senses.

210
00:16:05.36 --> 00:16:07.64
All right, you guys, get out of the car.

211
00:16:07.64 --> 00:16:12.84
There was the three of us from the Philippines and the friend of ours who was dead was in the

212
00:16:12.84 --> 00:16:14.64
diplomatic corps.

213
00:16:14.64 --> 00:16:19.16
So he starts at one end and it's a, you know, where are you from?

214
00:16:19.16 --> 00:16:21.36
Philippines, sir.

215
00:16:21.36 --> 00:16:22.36
Next, get Philippines.

216
00:16:22.36 --> 00:16:23.36
Me, Philippines.

217
00:16:23.36 --> 00:16:25.36
And so he comes to the last kid.

218
00:16:25.36 --> 00:16:28.08
I suppose you're from the Philippines to get us.

219
00:16:28.08 --> 00:16:30.12
No, sir, I'm from Saudi Arabia.

220
00:16:30.12 --> 00:16:35.32
So he said, you know, guys, if you go about half mile up the road, we don't go that far

221
00:16:35.32 --> 00:16:36.32
there.

222
00:16:36.32 --> 00:16:39.92
So, meanwhile, we had dumped the beer and everything.

223
00:16:39.92 --> 00:16:43.36
So, you know, that was just, that was the deal.

224
00:16:43.36 --> 00:16:44.36
Salt Lake City.

225
00:16:44.36 --> 00:16:47.000
And then at one point, did you start thinking, I'm going to go to the Naval Academy instead

226
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.52
of continuing with your career at the University of Utah.

227
00:16:50.52 --> 00:16:53.48
My career at the University of Utah was fading fast.

228
00:16:53.48 --> 00:16:57.48
I always say, I had joined NROTC and really enjoyed that.

229
00:16:57.48 --> 00:17:02.48
But the rest of academics really, you know, weren't my forte.

230
00:17:02.48 --> 00:17:08.80
About Christmas time, my parents were back in Newport, Rhode Island.

231
00:17:08.80 --> 00:17:12.24
So I had to call to train back to there for Christmas.

232
00:17:12.24 --> 00:17:15.92
And that's when my dad and I had some serious talks about, you know, what I was going

233
00:17:15.92 --> 00:17:20.96
to do and I said, okay, I promised him, I had to promise him that I would apply to the

234
00:17:20.96 --> 00:17:23.96
Naval Academy.

235
00:17:23.96 --> 00:17:28.68
And I wasn't, you know, that key not, but you know, I got to keep that happy.

236
00:17:28.68 --> 00:17:34.52
Happy dad and he kept that $50 a month spending money coming, which typically was spent

237
00:17:34.52 --> 00:17:36.64
long before I'd arrive.

238
00:17:36.64 --> 00:17:43.12
So I applied to the Naval Academy, took the SAT one weekend and it's a pricing and well.

239
00:17:43.12 --> 00:17:47.32
And a couple of months later, I get this little bond will open the mail and I'm thinking,

240
00:17:47.32 --> 00:17:50.64
you know, gosh, well, actually it was a packet, I guess.

241
00:17:50.64 --> 00:17:54.88
So I was thinking, I was afraid to open it and I roommate it.

242
00:17:54.88 --> 00:17:58.56
You know, if it was going to be a rejection letter, it's probably just a simple letter.

243
00:17:58.56 --> 00:18:01.84
And he said, you get a packet, you're probably going to, you're probably in so sure enough.

244
00:18:01.84 --> 00:18:02.84
I opened it up.

245
00:18:02.84 --> 00:18:08.24
I had been accepted at a presidential appointment from JFK and they went off.

246
00:18:08.24 --> 00:18:14.96
I had some interesting experiences as an NROTC kiddo at UNI at Utah.

247
00:18:14.96 --> 00:18:22.80
And one came from a senior and listed Marine there was a gunna, just an outstanding jet.

248
00:18:22.80 --> 00:18:24.48
He couldn't do enough for you.

249
00:18:24.48 --> 00:18:29.92
He organized the little programs on the weekends where we go out and set up ambushes

250
00:18:29.92 --> 00:18:34.56
in the canyons, up from Salt Lake's, up from the University of Utah.

251
00:18:34.56 --> 00:18:40.68
And it's really, so he kind of, I think that's where I got the idea that I wanted to be a Marine

252
00:18:40.68 --> 00:18:43.28
from gunna who is named, I can't remember.

253
00:18:43.28 --> 00:18:46.12
But was he in a World War II guy?

254
00:18:46.12 --> 00:18:47.32
I don't think so.

255
00:18:47.32 --> 00:18:49.36
I think he was more of a Korean guy.

256
00:18:49.36 --> 00:18:51.36
Just outstanding.

257
00:18:51.36 --> 00:18:53.40
He couldn't do enough for you.

258
00:18:53.40 --> 00:19:03.80
And he, in my speech class to give a speech that used a prop.

259
00:19:03.80 --> 00:19:08.36
And so we had just had a class on the Thompson Sub machine gun.

260
00:19:08.36 --> 00:19:09.96
Now, you can't imagine doing it.

261
00:19:09.96 --> 00:19:11.36
You couldn't do this today.

262
00:19:11.36 --> 00:19:12.36
No.

263
00:19:12.36 --> 00:19:14.96
So, hey, Gunny, can I burn a Thompson Sub machine gun?

264
00:19:14.96 --> 00:19:17.000
I got a Tuesday for my speech class.

265
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.44
It'll be gone for a couple hours.

266
00:19:18.44 --> 00:19:19.44
I head out.

267
00:19:19.44 --> 00:19:27.80
I get a, I get a Tark case from somebody on my floor in the dorm that I carry it in.

268
00:19:27.80 --> 00:19:32.26
So I'm carrying, I'm walking across campus with this guitar case with a Thompson Sub machine

269
00:19:32.26 --> 00:19:33.26
gunner.

270
00:19:33.26 --> 00:19:34.26
I didn't think I'd think of it.

271
00:19:34.26 --> 00:19:40.56
Back then, this was 60, fall of 62.

272
00:19:40.56 --> 00:19:44.84
Back to the speech class, and I said, you know, kind of, shut the class up.

273
00:19:44.84 --> 00:19:48.20
I'm here to talk about, you know, whatever.

274
00:19:48.20 --> 00:19:53.16
I don't, I, I don't, I, I forget what word I used, but I didn't, my weapon here, but

275
00:19:53.16 --> 00:19:54.88
my device here in the case.

276
00:19:54.88 --> 00:19:57.92
Of course, everybody thought I was going to be a Tark Poppeller's Thompson Sub machine

277
00:19:57.92 --> 00:19:58.92
gunner.

278
00:19:58.92 --> 00:20:02.92
The prop nearly kills over.

279
00:20:02.92 --> 00:20:03.92
So I give my little speel.

280
00:20:03.92 --> 00:20:05.76
It was very well received, I must say.

281
00:20:05.76 --> 00:20:10.52
I think I got an A for the speech, but he, he gave me a pretty good tongue lashing.

282
00:20:10.52 --> 00:20:13.12
I think about bringing such a thing to a classroom.

283
00:20:13.12 --> 00:20:14.12
You know, much better.

284
00:20:14.12 --> 00:20:16.12
I was interested in you and the other, right?

285
00:20:16.12 --> 00:20:19.60
No, probably not, but it was fun.

286
00:20:19.60 --> 00:20:24.24
So when you, when you, how long was it between when you got your acceptance letter, then

287
00:20:24.24 --> 00:20:28.44
when you actually showed up for a pleap summer?

288
00:20:28.44 --> 00:20:36.68
Showed up for pleap summer on June 26th of 1963, and I probably got my acceptance letter

289
00:20:36.68 --> 00:20:39.16
and March, March April, something like that.

290
00:20:39.16 --> 00:20:43.80
And were you, were you mentally prepared for pleap summer?

291
00:20:43.80 --> 00:20:45.64
I believe I was, yes.

292
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:53.48
In fact, I had pretty much come to all stop academically at Utah when I got the acceptance

293
00:20:53.48 --> 00:20:58.000
letter because they had had my first semester grades and that was all they were going to

294
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.24
evaluate.

295
00:20:59.24 --> 00:21:04.36
So I kind of ditched college for the next four or five months.

296
00:21:04.36 --> 00:21:09.88
There was a joke I heard later in the, in the ROTC, and then NROTC, and it was later

297
00:21:09.88 --> 00:21:14.32
that they, they joked that the way to get an unable academy was a flunk out of the University

298
00:21:14.32 --> 00:21:15.32
of Utah.

299
00:21:15.32 --> 00:21:18.92
But I did okay there.

300
00:21:18.92 --> 00:21:24.08
I struggled with academics at the NAV Academy, but I looked at it more as a leadership laboratory,

301
00:21:24.08 --> 00:21:25.08
I guess.

302
00:21:25.08 --> 00:21:29.92
And then so, so now it's 1963, you said when you started to start it?

303
00:21:29.92 --> 00:21:30.92
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:21:30.92 --> 00:21:33.72
Are you guys even thinking about Vietnam at this point?

305
00:21:33.72 --> 00:21:34.72
Or not.

306
00:21:34.72 --> 00:21:39.32
I can't even recall hearing about Vietnam.

307
00:21:39.32 --> 00:21:49.08
At Utah, that fall, we had heard and not part of, but the whole deal had been about

308
00:21:49.08 --> 00:21:50.72
the Cuban crisis.

309
00:21:50.72 --> 00:21:54.000
That was all the news that fall.

310
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.80
We followed that pretty closely, but now I don't think we had heard about Vietnam at all.

311
00:21:57.80 --> 00:22:01.36
Yeah, I think, I mean, things were not really escalated there at all.

312
00:22:01.36 --> 00:22:02.84
So not at that time.

313
00:22:02.84 --> 00:22:03.84
It's no surprise.

314
00:22:03.84 --> 00:22:09.84
And you were in a, I mean, you had some pretty notable people in your Naval Academy class.

315
00:22:09.84 --> 00:22:14.84
Well, this is true.

316
00:22:14.84 --> 00:22:20.72
I became friends early on with a fellow who, by then, at that time, went by Larry, Larry

317
00:22:20.72 --> 00:22:24.24
North, and now it goes by Oli.

318
00:22:24.24 --> 00:22:31.52
I want to, one of my friends in the class, after that was Jim Webb, he was a boxer.

319
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:34.28
I was a boxer, North was a boxer.

320
00:22:34.28 --> 00:22:37.08
Well, bunch of, bunch of guys I hung up with were a boxer.

321
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:42.56
We had a fellow in a race, Smith later on, became a two-star seal.

322
00:22:42.56 --> 00:22:45.56
I believe the first one to carry two stars.

323
00:22:45.56 --> 00:22:50.80
I'm not sure about that, but good guy, Captain of the track team.

324
00:22:50.80 --> 00:22:58.32
Had Pete Pace, and the class first, Marine, to ever be chair, the joint chiefs of staff,

325
00:22:58.32 --> 00:22:59.32
four stars.

326
00:22:59.32 --> 00:23:02.32
Pretty heavy duty company.

327
00:23:02.32 --> 00:23:03.32
Yeah.

328
00:23:03.32 --> 00:23:08.28
And then, what about, what about, was the stop-walk with you guys, too?

329
00:23:08.28 --> 00:23:09.68
Stop-and-back was in the class of 65.

330
00:23:09.68 --> 00:23:11.88
It was two years ahead of us.

331
00:23:11.88 --> 00:23:16.56
But our plea beer, the first year there, was the year he won the Heisman Trovie, which

332
00:23:16.56 --> 00:23:21.80
of course, argued well for plebes, because after a football game, if you won, you'd

333
00:23:21.80 --> 00:23:23.40
have carry on that weekend.

334
00:23:23.40 --> 00:23:28.24
And if you beat Army, you got carry on, meaning you didn't have to brace up in the halls.

335
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:31.80
And you know, chop around in the halls.

336
00:23:31.80 --> 00:23:37.32
And you didn't have to sit on the last couple inches of your chair in the mess room.

337
00:23:37.32 --> 00:23:42.68
And I know you got another guy that got some information on a guy by the name of Tex.

338
00:23:42.68 --> 00:23:47.16
Tex Harkins, fellow from Texas, needless to say.

339
00:23:47.16 --> 00:23:54.80
It was my roommate, plebe, summer, and plebeier, one of several, met him when I first came

340
00:23:54.80 --> 00:23:59.12
in the room, a sea bag full of gear that I had to stencil.

341
00:23:59.12 --> 00:24:04.04
He'd been there a couple hours, and it introduced himself as Maurice.

342
00:24:04.04 --> 00:24:09.68
Well, I did a double take, but I didn't think Maurice was going to fly.

343
00:24:09.68 --> 00:24:14.96
I'm sure a couple hours later when I was worn out from hearing about how great things were

344
00:24:14.96 --> 00:24:15.96
in Texas.

345
00:24:15.96 --> 00:24:17.52
You know, he became Tex.

346
00:24:17.52 --> 00:24:18.52
And Tex stuck.

347
00:24:18.52 --> 00:24:20.52
He still Tex to this day.

348
00:24:20.52 --> 00:24:21.52
Good guy.

349
00:24:21.52 --> 00:24:27.36
And you're so note about him trying to kill a firstee.

350
00:24:27.36 --> 00:24:28.36
That wasn't Tex.

351
00:24:28.36 --> 00:24:30.44
Oh, I was north.

352
00:24:30.44 --> 00:24:36.32
I stopped north going into this firstee's room early morning when we had window closing

353
00:24:36.32 --> 00:24:37.32
detail in the winter.

354
00:24:37.32 --> 00:24:40.28
You have to go in close up or class windows.

355
00:24:40.28 --> 00:24:45.60
He was headed off to this first classroom with a bayonet, bayonet.

356
00:24:45.60 --> 00:24:50.64
He was going to do this guy in this guy with a corset beyond belief.

357
00:24:50.64 --> 00:24:53.92
Ah, north, you can't do it.

358
00:24:53.92 --> 00:24:55.68
You'll get in serious trouble, buddy.

359
00:24:55.68 --> 00:24:57.08
Yeah, you can't kill someone.

360
00:24:57.08 --> 00:24:58.56
You're going to get in serious trouble.

361
00:24:58.56 --> 00:24:59.80
That's good advice right there.

362
00:24:59.80 --> 00:25:03.20
Clevver was a little different back then, I think.

363
00:25:03.20 --> 00:25:06.20
Not quite the same anymore.

364
00:25:06.20 --> 00:25:08.76
And then you talked about boxing.

365
00:25:08.76 --> 00:25:11.36
And were you a boxer before you showed up there?

366
00:25:11.36 --> 00:25:12.36
Negative.

367
00:25:12.36 --> 00:25:13.36
No.

368
00:25:13.36 --> 00:25:19.32
You just got into it when I was not a particularly athletic young man, but boxing was something

369
00:25:19.32 --> 00:25:23.12
that most of everybody started up from Brown Zero with no experience.

370
00:25:23.12 --> 00:25:24.76
So that's kind of what I did.

371
00:25:24.76 --> 00:25:31.72
Pleeb Summer and took it on to Pleebier and Boxed Pleebier.

372
00:25:31.72 --> 00:25:38.60
Some youngster year, which is sophomore year and St. Clash year, junior year.

373
00:25:38.60 --> 00:25:43.64
First class year, senior year I was in academic trouble shall we say.

374
00:25:43.64 --> 00:25:48.84
So, I wasn't on the boxing team, but I did run the boxing

375
00:25:48.84 --> 00:25:58.08
sub squad where freshmen and sophomores ended up if they failed boxing as part of the PT curriculum.

376
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:00.64
You'd have to go to a sub squad.

377
00:26:00.64 --> 00:26:06.04
Was for every sport until you could, you know, to sub-sculeda the sub squad past you.

378
00:26:06.04 --> 00:26:08.64
So you'd get a D. Good.

379
00:26:08.64 --> 00:26:09.64
Couldn't have an African.

380
00:26:09.64 --> 00:26:10.64
Did they make you?

381
00:26:10.64 --> 00:26:15.08
I know guys that I know that went to Naval Academy, they made them boxed for a semester.

382
00:26:15.08 --> 00:26:16.72
They made them wrestle for a semester.

383
00:26:16.72 --> 00:26:20.52
Did they make you guys do wrestling in D. Good?

384
00:26:20.52 --> 00:26:23.32
We did wrestling. Boxing.

385
00:26:23.32 --> 00:26:26.72
We had a part of the PT curriculum where it was mandatory.

386
00:26:26.72 --> 00:26:34.92
You had two years of boxing lessons, two years of wrestling, two years of gymnastics.

387
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:39.92
Four years of swimming and they fed in all kinds of other things.

388
00:26:39.92 --> 00:26:42.32
Squash and golf and track.

389
00:26:42.32 --> 00:26:50.12
But, yeah, first two years you had some mandatory things that you had to pass as part of the PT curriculum.

390
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:52.12
Didn't have judo.

391
00:26:52.12 --> 00:26:57.12
Well, it's still boxing and wrestling is an awesome base to have as a fighter.

392
00:26:57.12 --> 00:26:59.12
And they feel just going there.

393
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:00.52
You're pretty good to go.

394
00:27:00.52 --> 00:27:01.72
Yeah, I didn't.

395
00:27:01.72 --> 00:27:10.12
I know you did some cornering for some of the guys, you know, when they were boxing.

396
00:27:10.12 --> 00:27:13.72
I did. That was my senior year, first class year.

397
00:27:13.72 --> 00:27:18.32
And North was in the finals, the boxing finals.

398
00:27:18.32 --> 00:27:23.72
You could win your Navy and your letter in boxing.

399
00:27:23.72 --> 00:27:26.92
Even though it was not an in-emeral sport, so much.

400
00:27:26.92 --> 00:27:29.32
But it was a more of a club sport.

401
00:27:29.32 --> 00:27:32.52
But we didn't box against other institutions.

402
00:27:32.52 --> 00:27:33.52
They do now.

403
00:27:33.52 --> 00:27:35.52
But it was all within the brigade.

404
00:27:35.52 --> 00:27:40.92
And we have championed, we'd have quarter-finals, semi-files and finals.

405
00:27:40.92 --> 00:27:46.92
And I was a North corner the year he won his and boxing against another well.

406
00:27:46.92 --> 00:27:53.32
And then on the Naval Academy graduate, Jim Webb, well, I think you've had on your program before.

407
00:27:53.32 --> 00:27:54.32
Indeed.

408
00:27:54.32 --> 00:27:58.32
And shall we say it was interesting.

409
00:27:58.32 --> 00:28:00.52
Webb had a lot of experience boxing.

410
00:28:00.52 --> 00:28:04.32
He'd boxed the Golden Gloves, I believe, before he came to the Naval Academy.

411
00:28:04.32 --> 00:28:08.72
Or at least a city in County, type boxing and state boxing.

412
00:28:08.72 --> 00:28:11.92
From wherever he was, this dead was stationed at the time.

413
00:28:11.92 --> 00:28:15.32
But he and North never, they were two folks that were but heads.

414
00:28:15.32 --> 00:28:20.12
I think their entire careers, and whenever they would run into each other,

415
00:28:20.12 --> 00:28:23.32
certainly at the Naval Academy, and certainly when they were boxing.

416
00:28:23.32 --> 00:28:24.52
But it was an interesting night.

417
00:28:24.52 --> 00:28:26.92
So this is a legit grudge match.

418
00:28:26.92 --> 00:28:32.92
If I think that probably would be fair to say, it had to go down.

419
00:28:32.92 --> 00:28:36.32
North one, much to everybody's surprise.

420
00:28:36.32 --> 00:28:39.12
North was the street fighter.

421
00:28:39.12 --> 00:28:42.72
And Webb was a more polished boxer.

422
00:28:42.72 --> 00:28:47.52
Yeah, that's, I mean, if you boxed, if you boxed certainly at the Golden Gloves level,

423
00:28:47.52 --> 00:28:50.72
even at like the County level, you're really good.

424
00:28:50.72 --> 00:28:51.72
Oh, yeah.

425
00:28:51.72 --> 00:28:52.72
Yeah.

426
00:28:52.72 --> 00:28:56.12
So that's a, that's a, that's a big achievement.

427
00:28:56.12 --> 00:29:01.52
Well, but somehow they spend, you know, people look backwards and it,

428
00:29:01.52 --> 00:29:05.52
always comes up when you start talking about North and or Webb, you know,

429
00:29:05.52 --> 00:29:07.12
it was the boxing match.

430
00:29:08.12 --> 00:29:09.92
Everybody knew it was a, did it, did it, did it, did it.

431
00:29:09.92 --> 00:29:10.92
Don't get a distance.

432
00:29:10.92 --> 00:29:14.92
It did the distance being only three rounds, you know, back then.

433
00:29:14.92 --> 00:29:15.52
Yeah.

434
00:29:15.52 --> 00:29:17.32
Why are they two minute rounds with three minute rounds?

435
00:29:17.32 --> 00:29:18.92
Because sometimes they have Ambitr's boxed,

436
00:29:18.92 --> 00:29:19.72
time in a round.

437
00:29:19.72 --> 00:29:20.92
I think there were two minute rounds.

438
00:29:20.92 --> 00:29:21.32
Yeah.

439
00:29:21.32 --> 00:29:23.92
They were six minutes of fury.

440
00:29:23.92 --> 00:29:24.32
Blot.

441
00:29:24.32 --> 00:29:24.92
Yeah.

442
00:29:25.72 --> 00:29:27.92
And I know the wrestling kind of wiped you out.

443
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:32.52
And, you know, five, six minutes, but we were, we were spent on, you know,

444
00:29:32.52 --> 00:29:33.72
at the end of a boxing match.

445
00:29:33.72 --> 00:29:36.32
You were spent with all you could do to,

446
00:29:36.32 --> 00:29:39.92
just pull yourself out of the ring.

447
00:29:39.92 --> 00:29:44.92
They wanted you, like for boxing for use as you were new to boxing.

448
00:29:44.92 --> 00:29:47.12
And you weren't much of an athlete before.

449
00:29:47.12 --> 00:29:49.52
What do you think you took away from boxing?

450
00:29:49.52 --> 00:29:53.92
Well, don't quit.

451
00:29:53.92 --> 00:30:01.52
I went to the semi-finals, my junior year got knocked out of the ring by that guy,

452
00:30:01.52 --> 00:30:02.92
by my, by a point.

453
00:30:02.92 --> 00:30:08.72
Got back up, got back in the ring, took the standing eight count, and finished the fight.

454
00:30:08.72 --> 00:30:14.72
And, I know, I met a Marine officer a year later when I was, you know, on service

455
00:30:14.72 --> 00:30:17.92
election night, I was able to select the Marine Corps.

456
00:30:17.92 --> 00:30:20.12
And he said, got to the same thing I would ever say.

457
00:30:20.12 --> 00:30:22.12
Oh, thank you, sir.

458
00:30:22.12 --> 00:30:24.72
But, you know, you don't quit.

459
00:30:24.72 --> 00:30:26.32
It ain't over until it's over.

460
00:30:26.32 --> 00:30:29.52
You know, and it was over that night for me.

461
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:34.12
But, and you mentioned from the gunny that you work with at the University of Utah,

462
00:30:34.12 --> 00:30:37.12
that you were thinking Marine Corps when you showed up at the Naval Academy.

463
00:30:37.12 --> 00:30:40.12
Was that, was that, did you stick with that the whole time?

464
00:30:40.12 --> 00:30:47.52
I did, you know, my dad being career-nab, I, I, I, I, I could never feel his footsteps.

465
00:30:47.52 --> 00:30:52.52
Uh, and he, he was perplexed while I was going to go Marine Corps.

466
00:30:52.52 --> 00:30:54.92
He, he, he asked me straight out one time.

467
00:30:54.92 --> 00:30:57.52
I think it was a, a first senior, a senior said,

468
00:30:57.52 --> 00:31:02.52
uh, my, what is it that the Marine Corps, second Lieutenant has that, a Navy incident,

469
00:31:02.52 --> 00:31:06.52
doesn't have, you know, they got three hot meals a day, and I said,

470
00:31:06.52 --> 00:31:12.52
I said, I said, I said, what, what if the Marine Corps, second Lieutenant, got that, a Navy incident, doesn't have.

471
00:31:12.52 --> 00:31:15.52
I was like, I'm just saying, yeah, I think it's respect.

472
00:31:15.52 --> 00:31:18.52
Ooh, shots by the shot.

473
00:31:18.52 --> 00:31:21.52
Shondouman down.

474
00:31:21.52 --> 00:31:27.52
Wow. Yeah, that's, that's definitely, that's definitely shots fired for sure.

475
00:31:27.52 --> 00:31:32.52
And, uh, my grandma was not somebody you would probably want to say that to.

476
00:31:32.52 --> 00:31:34.52
I don't know about at the time though.

477
00:31:34.52 --> 00:31:37.52
Well, he was not a nice guy.

478
00:31:37.52 --> 00:31:41.52
Hey, hey, hey, hey, just was like I said a little to the right of a tilde on.

479
00:31:41.52 --> 00:31:47.52
And there was, there was, a couple of ways to do things. There was his way, and there was everybody else's.

480
00:31:47.52 --> 00:31:54.52
He, he took me out for dinner before I, you know, got on the train to head off from the Naval Academy from,

481
00:31:54.52 --> 00:31:58.52
from, from Providence, Rhode Island where it could catch the train back then.

482
00:31:58.52 --> 00:32:05.52
And he said, he told me, he said, Bobby, you graduated from the Naval Academy, and I'll buy you the car of your choice.

483
00:32:05.52 --> 00:32:06.52
Oh, thank you, Dad.

484
00:32:06.52 --> 00:32:09.52
Four years later, I'm getting close to graduation.

485
00:32:09.52 --> 00:32:12.52
I said, Dad, you remember when I, when I, when I left the Naval Academy,

486
00:32:12.52 --> 00:32:15.52
I just told him you buy me the car of my choice if I graduate?

487
00:32:15.52 --> 00:32:18.52
He looked at me and said, did you get it in writing?

488
00:32:18.52 --> 00:32:19.52
No.

489
00:32:19.52 --> 00:32:21.52
Come on.

490
00:32:21.52 --> 00:32:22.52
No.

491
00:32:22.52 --> 00:32:28.52
It, as you, as the other thing that's on the folding is it's, in 1963, when you show up there, hey,

492
00:32:28.52 --> 00:32:31.52
I'm going to be a Marine, but you, there's no war going on.

493
00:32:31.52 --> 00:32:36.52
Now we fast forward. It's 19, well, 1967.

494
00:32:36.52 --> 00:32:42.52
Yeah. And Vietnam is now, I mean Vietnam really started escalating like 1965,

495
00:32:42.52 --> 00:32:45.52
1966 even more in 1967.

496
00:32:45.52 --> 00:32:50.52
I mean, you guys now know in the Marine Corps what you're signing up for.

497
00:32:50.52 --> 00:32:51.52
They're no mystery.

498
00:32:51.52 --> 00:32:55.52
Oh, no, no, no. We know precisely what we were signing up for.

499
00:32:55.52 --> 00:32:57.52
There was a board.

500
00:32:57.52 --> 00:33:02.52
I think this has been referenced in other places and books and articles.

501
00:33:02.52 --> 00:33:05.52
A board of, you know, those who've gone before, so it's, it died.

502
00:33:05.52 --> 00:33:11.52
And it was starting to fill up with pictures and names from Vietnam.

503
00:33:11.52 --> 00:33:14.52
So yeah, we understood that.

504
00:33:14.52 --> 00:33:19.52
But you know, I'm sure I've been coming back to yourself that, as you know,

505
00:33:19.52 --> 00:33:20.52
it's not going to happen to you.

506
00:33:20.52 --> 00:33:24.52
Maybe the guy on the left or the right, but not to your bulletproof.

507
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:27.52
These are in your own mind.

508
00:33:27.52 --> 00:33:32.52
And so, you know, you worried about maybe getting maimed.

509
00:33:32.52 --> 00:33:34.52
I don't think we even worried about that.

510
00:33:34.52 --> 00:33:38.52
You're worried about possibly getting killed, but then, hey,

511
00:33:38.52 --> 00:33:39.52
there's nothing to happen with that.

512
00:33:39.52 --> 00:33:42.52
You know, your worries are done.

513
00:33:42.52 --> 00:33:44.52
And then your family picks up on it.

514
00:33:44.52 --> 00:33:47.52
All you thought you might get a little, you know, a flee flicker,

515
00:33:47.52 --> 00:33:50.52
a flicker, a wound or something like that and get a purple heart,

516
00:33:50.52 --> 00:33:54.52
but you never figured, you know, you might come back, but I'll limbs

517
00:33:54.52 --> 00:33:57.52
or otherwise, you know, markedly impaired.

518
00:33:57.52 --> 00:33:59.52
That just never entered your mind.

519
00:33:59.52 --> 00:34:03.52
I'm sure if it did, you would have been useless to your unit.

520
00:34:03.52 --> 00:34:06.52
Yeah.

521
00:34:06.52 --> 00:34:11.52
The guys that are all going for the marine option at the academy,

522
00:34:11.52 --> 00:34:13.52
it's competitive, right?

523
00:34:13.52 --> 00:34:15.52
It's hard to get that.

524
00:34:15.52 --> 00:34:17.52
Is it hard to get that marine option coming out of the academy?

525
00:34:17.52 --> 00:34:21.52
Oh, well, I can't speak for today because today,

526
00:34:21.52 --> 00:34:25.52
I have like 250, you know, guys in Galsk going to the Marine Corps.

527
00:34:25.52 --> 00:34:29.52
In my day and in the years and the sixies and before,

528
00:34:29.52 --> 00:34:33.52
there was a certain percentage of a classic Goulmere Inc.

529
00:34:33.52 --> 00:34:39.52
We had some, just about 900 guys in my class and we had 86 slots.

530
00:34:39.52 --> 00:34:42.52
And they were divided in half from the,

531
00:34:42.52 --> 00:34:46.52
to took half from the upper half of the class,

532
00:34:46.52 --> 00:34:48.52
grade wise, and half from the lower.

533
00:34:48.52 --> 00:34:52.52
So you could get in the Marine Corps, say in being the middle of the lower half

534
00:34:52.52 --> 00:34:57.52
of your class, when a fellow who was in the lower part of the upper half of this class,

535
00:34:57.52 --> 00:35:02.52
wouldn't have got selected because those, you know, 43 slots were gone.

536
00:35:02.52 --> 00:35:04.52
And I got slot 86.

537
00:35:04.52 --> 00:35:09.52
Well, when I went down for service selection night, I was sweating well.

538
00:35:09.52 --> 00:35:12.52
But what I got, in fact, a good friend of mine,

539
00:35:12.52 --> 00:35:17.52
who was a couple of numbers behind me offered me two grand for my spot.

540
00:35:17.52 --> 00:35:19.52
If I would give it up and so because he wanted to go Marine Corps,

541
00:35:19.52 --> 00:35:21.52
I knew how much he wanted to go Marine Corps.

542
00:35:21.52 --> 00:35:23.52
You know, I can't do that.

543
00:35:23.52 --> 00:35:25.52
You know that, he said, you know that.

544
00:35:25.52 --> 00:35:28.52
But they was competitive in that respect.

545
00:35:28.52 --> 00:35:30.52
It was, you know, academics played a lot.

546
00:35:30.52 --> 00:35:32.52
A big part in it.

547
00:35:32.52 --> 00:35:33.52
Yeah.

548
00:35:33.52 --> 00:35:37.52
The Marine Corps does that with the way they give your jobs in the Marine Corps, too.

549
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:39.52
Like coming out of the basic school.

550
00:35:39.52 --> 00:35:42.52
I know that they take the class and break it up in the thirds.

551
00:35:42.52 --> 00:35:46.52
And like the first, you pick your job.

552
00:35:46.52 --> 00:35:48.52
So you could be the number one guy and you,

553
00:35:48.52 --> 00:35:51.52
or if you get the number one guy, you can get your job.

554
00:35:51.52 --> 00:35:54.52
But you might be the top of the next third down.

555
00:35:54.52 --> 00:35:58.52
And you get your selection and then the top of the last third and you get your selection.

556
00:35:58.52 --> 00:36:01.52
So it's, it's a, it's a way that they distribute the people.

557
00:36:01.52 --> 00:36:05.52
So that not every single, the, the top of the class goes,

558
00:36:05.52 --> 00:36:08.52
everyone's going to go his infantry in the whatever job it's at the bottom.

559
00:36:08.52 --> 00:36:10.52
We get a bunch of people that weren't the highest performers.

560
00:36:10.52 --> 00:36:11.52
Right.

561
00:36:11.52 --> 00:36:12.52
Exactly.

562
00:36:12.52 --> 00:36:13.52
The Marine Corps smart.

563
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:15.52
It's about the Marine Corps in the Marine Corps.

564
00:36:15.52 --> 00:36:17.52
The Marine Corps understands that it's about the Marine Corps.

565
00:36:17.52 --> 00:36:21.52
Because they haven't lasted this long without being able to put up a good fight.

566
00:36:21.52 --> 00:36:28.52
You know, in a nation's wars and back in the DC area, when the time comes along for

567
00:36:28.52 --> 00:36:30.52
keeping the Marine Corps in the Marine Corps.

568
00:36:30.52 --> 00:36:34.52
And that was, as, as your dad talked and you had any more about looking at you and saying,

569
00:36:34.52 --> 00:36:38.52
hey, son, there's a war going on and he's, you know, obviously being in the Navy in a war war two.

570
00:36:38.52 --> 00:36:40.52
He knows exactly what the Marine Corps does.

571
00:36:40.52 --> 00:36:44.52
And he's, is he having any more talks to you and saying, hey, you might want to think about this a little bit more?

572
00:36:44.52 --> 00:36:45.52
No, I don't know.

573
00:36:45.52 --> 00:36:48.52
I, you know, he kind of respected my decision, I guess.

574
00:36:48.52 --> 00:36:51.52
And just, you know, let me go.

575
00:36:51.52 --> 00:36:54.52
I guess he is an interesting person.

576
00:36:54.52 --> 00:36:57.52
I got back to Bethesda after I was shot.

577
00:36:57.52 --> 00:36:59.52
I spent 12 months in Bethesda.

578
00:36:59.52 --> 00:37:03.52
He can be seen me once, which for him was probably enough.

579
00:37:03.52 --> 00:37:06.52
And actually for me, wasn't enough to.

580
00:37:06.52 --> 00:37:15.52
But I, you know, I later on found out that he obviously was affected, you know, by my being moved.

581
00:37:15.52 --> 00:37:22.52
I kind of joked in one day, one day we were out, you know, barbecue and some hot dogs or something.

582
00:37:22.52 --> 00:37:26.52
And I said, dad, you almost collected on my life insurance.

583
00:37:26.52 --> 00:37:28.52
What are you talking about, Bobby?

584
00:37:28.52 --> 00:37:38.52
I said, what's your dad, you almost got that 10-ser 10-grain, you know, serviceman's group life insurance from, from, from my demise and we are not much.

585
00:37:38.52 --> 00:37:39.52
Don't talk like that.

586
00:37:39.52 --> 00:37:41.52
That was it.

587
00:37:41.52 --> 00:37:43.52
That's, that's the affection you got.

588
00:37:43.52 --> 00:37:50.52
That was the, yeah, that was the understanding and the compassion that I got from Beth.

589
00:37:50.52 --> 00:37:57.52
So you get done with, you get done with the Naval Academy, you graduate, and now you're going to the basic school.

590
00:37:57.52 --> 00:37:58.52
Right.

591
00:37:58.52 --> 00:38:03.52
Do you remember what rank you were at the Academy, how close to the bottom?

592
00:38:03.52 --> 00:38:04.52
Right.

593
00:38:04.52 --> 00:38:11.52
Oh, I think I was, since on service election, I went down in groups of 50, which is why I was sweating,

594
00:38:11.52 --> 00:38:15.52
getting a place in the Marine Corps because you know, they could have all been gone by the time.

595
00:38:15.52 --> 00:38:20.52
I got down there in the last group of 50, because I was in the last group of 50.

596
00:38:20.52 --> 00:38:21.52
Oh, there you go.

597
00:38:21.52 --> 00:38:23.52
So, answer that question.

598
00:38:23.52 --> 00:38:25.52
You weren't in command, so you didn't-

599
00:38:25.52 --> 00:38:26.52
No, I wasn't in command.

600
00:38:26.52 --> 00:38:27.52
You didn't collect any money.

601
00:38:27.52 --> 00:38:29.52
I didn't get the dollar from everybody, but, uh,

602
00:38:29.52 --> 00:38:31.52
Oh, is that what the last time was with the last time?

603
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:32.52
That's right.

604
00:38:32.52 --> 00:38:37.52
The lunch by the, you know, I've never confirmed, but the last person in the class gets a dollar from, for every last thing.

605
00:38:37.52 --> 00:38:42.52
Well, so you can walk off with, you know, six, seven, eight, nine hundred bucks.

606
00:38:42.52 --> 00:38:46.52
This spot of distinction, I guess.

607
00:38:46.52 --> 00:38:47.52
Or not.

608
00:38:47.52 --> 00:38:48.52
Well, we were-

609
00:38:48.52 --> 00:38:49.52
We were still gradually.

610
00:38:49.52 --> 00:38:51.52
So, I guess at that point, it doesn't matter.

611
00:38:51.52 --> 00:38:52.52
And you got paid.

612
00:38:52.52 --> 00:38:56.52
My class, we were kind of put out by, because our anchor man was a foreign national.

613
00:38:56.52 --> 00:38:59.52
I think from a country that didn't even have a Navy.

614
00:38:59.52 --> 00:39:03.52
So, we were like, do we even want to fart over this buck for this guy?

615
00:39:03.52 --> 00:39:05.52
And of course we did, because that was just-

616
00:39:05.52 --> 00:39:06.52
That's a tradition.

617
00:39:06.52 --> 00:39:07.52
It's always been that way.

618
00:39:07.52 --> 00:39:13.52
So, uh, you showed the TDS, and now it's 1968?

619
00:39:13.52 --> 00:39:15.52
No, no.

620
00:39:15.52 --> 00:39:21.52
Graduated in June of June 7th of 67.

621
00:39:21.52 --> 00:39:28.52
And I put in for the first basic school class that was forming, which is a first of July.

622
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:32.52
That was the beginning of the fiscal year back then, July 1st.

623
00:39:32.52 --> 00:39:39.52
So, you know, I had a few weeks in home, bloom right back down to the quannico, the start

624
00:39:39.52 --> 00:39:40.52
the basics school.

625
00:39:40.52 --> 00:39:44.52
Okay, so you started in the summer sometime in the summer of 1967.

626
00:39:44.52 --> 00:39:45.52
Right.

627
00:39:45.52 --> 00:39:49.52
And you know, how well did the Naval Academy prepare you for the basics school?

628
00:39:49.52 --> 00:39:54.52
I think pretty well, uh, of course we didn't ever get into the tactical side of things

629
00:39:54.52 --> 00:39:59.52
of the Naval Academy for the Marine Corps, but, you know, you were in good shape.

630
00:39:59.52 --> 00:40:03.52
Yeah, obviously could wear a ear in a farm, whichever it was in Marine Corps or Navy Corps,

631
00:40:03.52 --> 00:40:07.52
well, because you've been doing it for the past four years.

632
00:40:07.52 --> 00:40:13.52
And I had gone to jump school between, on my summer leave, between June, or in senior year.

633
00:40:13.52 --> 00:40:16.52
And, you know, the physical requirements for that were pretty demanding.

634
00:40:16.52 --> 00:40:23.52
You know, we got data for it, bending and August after crews, and, man, that baby is hot.

635
00:40:23.52 --> 00:40:27.52
That red clay and charge it reflects that heat and you sweat.

636
00:40:27.52 --> 00:40:29.52
They saw those midship and come.

637
00:40:29.52 --> 00:40:35.52
And of course, you know, we were, we'd, we'd be running around with Navy cheers and any

638
00:40:35.52 --> 00:40:42.52
cadre fellow, you know, staff sergeants that could pop up and, you know, halt us and drop us for push-ups and everything.

639
00:40:42.52 --> 00:40:44.52
Which we'd love.

640
00:40:44.52 --> 00:40:50.52
I don't think they're any UDT or SEAL groups going through when we went through, but they just ate the program up, you know.

641
00:40:50.52 --> 00:40:51.52
Yeah.

642
00:40:51.52 --> 00:40:52.52
Needless to say.

643
00:40:52.52 --> 00:40:58.52
But I was one of the eventually SEAL stop to go into airborne school at Fort Benning, Georgia and started running it in house.

644
00:40:58.52 --> 00:40:59.52
Okay.

645
00:40:59.52 --> 00:41:01.52
But yeah, I was lucky enough to go to airborne school.

646
00:41:01.52 --> 00:41:06.52
And yes, the instructors down there, definitely appreciated our presence and said, well, let's know that.

647
00:41:06.52 --> 00:41:07.52
Sure they did.

648
00:41:07.52 --> 00:41:13.52
It's ridiculous too, because we're coming out of, you know, but, right, literally a week, or whatever.

649
00:41:13.52 --> 00:41:15.52
You know, we travel across country, we show up there.

650
00:41:15.52 --> 00:41:17.52
So we're in really good shape.

651
00:41:17.52 --> 00:41:20.52
So there was really nothing that they could do to us.

652
00:41:20.52 --> 00:41:25.52
We just would, and of course that encouraged guys to be, you know, wise asses.

653
00:41:25.52 --> 00:41:27.52
And you know, you, I'm going to make a new push-ups.

654
00:41:27.52 --> 00:41:29.52
You can't make new enough push-ups.

655
00:41:29.52 --> 00:41:31.52
So there's that whole thing going.

656
00:41:31.52 --> 00:41:36.52
And now that you're at TBS though, well, now you know exactly what's going to happen.

657
00:41:36.52 --> 00:41:39.52
You know, you're going to go to Vietnam.

658
00:41:39.52 --> 00:41:45.52
Right, regardless of your MLS that you came out with, of course, I'm going to be an O3 and most of my friends did too.

659
00:41:45.52 --> 00:41:46.52
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

660
00:41:46.52 --> 00:41:47.52
So it's not actually guaranteed.

661
00:41:47.52 --> 00:41:52.52
So I'm thinking you still have to do a service selection inside or whatever job or selection inside the ring.

662
00:41:52.52 --> 00:41:53.52
Exactly.

663
00:41:53.52 --> 00:41:54.52
Exactly.

664
00:41:54.52 --> 00:41:58.52
You put in for your top three and you hope you get number one of course.

665
00:41:58.52 --> 00:42:09.52
And the most guys did, you're pretty savvy about your capabilities and your, you know, likes and dislikes by the time you get to TBS.

666
00:42:09.52 --> 00:42:11.52
I think regardless of where you come from.

667
00:42:11.52 --> 00:42:16.52
You know, we had a lot of recent ROTC grads and recent OCS grads.

668
00:42:16.52 --> 00:42:21.52
And the Naval Academy grads and you couldn't distinguish who came from what pipeline.

669
00:42:21.52 --> 00:42:24.52
You know, they're all pretty motivated folks back then.

670
00:42:24.52 --> 00:42:30.52
And I'm sure all the instructors must have been guys that were coming off of towards the,

671
00:42:30.52 --> 00:42:32.52
They were just back from their tours.

672
00:42:32.52 --> 00:42:34.52
We had them and they were all captains or above.

673
00:42:34.52 --> 00:42:36.52
Yeah, very sharp guys.

674
00:42:36.52 --> 00:42:41.52
They didn't pick a slacker to be, uh, instructors at TBS.

675
00:42:41.52 --> 00:42:51.52
And how, I mean, compared to the Naval Academy, was it just a totally different vibe of seriousness because they know what exactly what they're preparing for you guys for?

676
00:42:51.52 --> 00:42:53.52
It sure was.

677
00:42:53.52 --> 00:43:01.52
Uh, you know, you're here out on problems, uh, daytime problems, nighttime problems, uh, didn't matter when they ended.

678
00:43:01.52 --> 00:43:07.52
And if you got back and turned in any, any gear you checked out at 3 a.m. in the morning,

679
00:43:07.52 --> 00:43:11.52
you're still up at 0-0-0-30 the next morning.

680
00:43:11.52 --> 00:43:13.52
You didn't do that at the Naval Academy.

681
00:43:13.52 --> 00:43:15.52
You know, you had study hour and stuff like that.

682
00:43:15.52 --> 00:43:20.52
But, uh, now there was a definitely heightened level of seriousness at the basic school.

683
00:43:20.52 --> 00:43:23.52
Again, all the instructors who were giving you straight poop, you know,

684
00:43:23.52 --> 00:43:24.52
big footers.

685
00:43:24.52 --> 00:43:27.52
They had just come back from there or recently back.

686
00:43:27.52 --> 00:43:31.52
My, uh, platoon command, we had a platoon of about 50 guys.

687
00:43:31.52 --> 00:43:35.52
It was a, a captain, two silver stars, well decorated.

688
00:43:35.52 --> 00:43:38.52
Big guy, you know, they don't take, uh, again,

689
00:43:38.52 --> 00:43:41.52
I, the Marine Corps looks at you all kinds of ways.

690
00:43:41.52 --> 00:43:47.52
They look at how you did it, basic school, uh, your height versus your weight.

691
00:43:47.52 --> 00:43:53.52
Uh, some other, obviously other factors before they assign you someplace like if you're,

692
00:43:53.52 --> 00:43:57.52
if you think you want to get to, to eight to nine, uh,

693
00:43:57.52 --> 00:44:03.52
and be part of that in Washington, D.C. you know, you've got to be like six feet or higher in taller than whatever.

694
00:44:03.52 --> 00:44:07.52
Because, you know, they're standing on the cream with their crap because you're,

695
00:44:07.52 --> 00:44:08.52
you know, you're representing the, you know,

696
00:44:08.52 --> 00:44:11.52
it's a Marine Corps in front of the public on a regular basis.

697
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:14.52
And rightfully so, you know, all the services do that.

698
00:44:14.52 --> 00:44:19.52
You know, the guards at our own ten aren't, you know, four feet eight and sloppy.

699
00:44:19.52 --> 00:44:23.52
You know, they're all standing tall and looking good and very professional.

700
00:44:23.52 --> 00:44:24.52
Needless to say.

701
00:44:24.52 --> 00:44:28.52
How hard was it to, uh, you know, when you, when you started,

702
00:44:28.52 --> 00:44:31.52
pick your job obviously, you said you wanted to be an infantry,

703
00:44:31.52 --> 00:44:35.52
infantry, a two-commander, how much competition was there for that?

704
00:44:35.52 --> 00:44:39.52
What did you have guys that were like all I'm not doing that?

705
00:44:39.52 --> 00:44:41.52
I'm not doing that job. You can have it.

706
00:44:41.52 --> 00:44:44.52
And what's there, what's their competition for it?

707
00:44:44.52 --> 00:44:48.52
Um, I think there was only cop, there, we didn't feel competition.

708
00:44:48.52 --> 00:44:51.52
You know, obviously had to do well on the,

709
00:44:51.52 --> 00:44:53.52
of course, and all the different evolutions.

710
00:44:53.52 --> 00:44:55.52
You know, the past the PRT and, you know,

711
00:44:55.52 --> 00:44:59.52
you had to do well in land navigation, daytime, nighttime,

712
00:44:59.52 --> 00:45:01.52
daytime, daytime, daytime, daytime, daytime, daytime.

713
00:45:01.52 --> 00:45:05.52
That was, that was just part of the competition of TBS.

714
00:45:05.52 --> 00:45:09.52
You were always competing with your, but your,

715
00:45:09.52 --> 00:45:10.52
What do you call?

716
00:45:10.52 --> 00:45:11.52
Your classmates.

717
00:45:11.52 --> 00:45:13.52
Classmate.

718
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:15.52
Yeah, your classmates at TBS.

719
00:45:15.52 --> 00:45:20.52
But, uh, you know, a lot of guys wanted to go infantry.

720
00:45:20.52 --> 00:45:23.52
And obviously not everybody was going to go infantry.

721
00:45:23.52 --> 00:45:26.52
I don't know what the selection process was, but, uh,

722
00:45:26.52 --> 00:45:28.92
I had a good friend from the Naval Academy.

723
00:45:28.92 --> 00:45:31.92
Not really good friend, but he was like,

724
00:45:31.92 --> 00:45:33.12
he was like, how did that go?

725
00:45:33.12 --> 00:45:35.52
Are you going to go in for treat two?

726
00:45:35.52 --> 00:45:38.72
Also, meaning also, I, in of course, you had no idea.

727
00:45:38.72 --> 00:45:41.72
It depends on what the Marine Corps,

728
00:45:41.72 --> 00:45:44.92
what their selection process was, and whether you made or not,

729
00:45:44.92 --> 00:45:49.92
and ended up not getting infantry, which was probably

730
00:45:49.92 --> 00:45:53.92
probably a good move for him and the Corps.

731
00:45:53.92 --> 00:45:56.92
Is there anything that you had struggles with

732
00:45:56.92 --> 00:46:00.92
when you're going through the base as well?

733
00:46:00.92 --> 00:46:03.92
A lot of them, maybe, you know, the O Corps or something like that,

734
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:07.92
but that was just at, you know, an eight minute struggle.

735
00:46:07.92 --> 00:46:11.92
As long as you were doing the best, best you could,

736
00:46:11.92 --> 00:46:14.92
you know, they didn't beat you up too hard or a market down,

737
00:46:14.92 --> 00:46:19.92
but no, I didn't really feel that there was anything that was going to hold me back.

738
00:46:19.92 --> 00:46:23.92
And they're training you with all the tactics, small unit tactics,

739
00:46:23.92 --> 00:46:27.92
Naval Gunfire, Colin for fire, all, all, there, are you feeling

740
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:31.92
like you, were you feeling like you were getting good preparation for the battlefield?

741
00:46:31.92 --> 00:46:33.92
I did.

742
00:46:33.92 --> 00:46:37.92
What the base of school does is teach you everything you need to know

743
00:46:37.92 --> 00:46:39.92
as a company level officer, you know, from your time,

744
00:46:39.92 --> 00:46:43.92
it's a second lead to end up to a captain.

745
00:46:43.92 --> 00:46:48.92
After that, there's another school, there's, I'm not sure what it's called,

746
00:46:48.92 --> 00:46:51.92
but, you know, for senior captains, a new major,

747
00:46:51.92 --> 00:46:53.92
but, yeah, I felt well prepared.

748
00:46:53.92 --> 00:46:57.92
They had a Vietnam village built up in Quantico,

749
00:46:57.92 --> 00:47:01.92
staff, of course, by Vietnamese, duh.

750
00:47:01.92 --> 00:47:04.92
And, you know, you practice that, you know,

751
00:47:04.92 --> 00:47:07.92
you did hill-computer operations, you did, you know,

752
00:47:07.92 --> 00:47:11.92
walking insertions, you did land navigation, daytime, and night,

753
00:47:11.92 --> 00:47:15.92
which I'm sure, you know, is a different, a horse of a different color.

754
00:47:15.92 --> 00:47:20.92
It was indeed, but, apparently, it was pretty efficient.

755
00:47:20.92 --> 00:47:23.92
Like, right away, it's seventh in the class,

756
00:47:23.92 --> 00:47:27.92
not the first, like, web did it as class,

757
00:47:27.92 --> 00:47:29.92
but that's, that's okay.

758
00:47:29.92 --> 00:47:31.92
Seven was good enough for a letter accommodation

759
00:47:31.92 --> 00:47:33.92
coming out of the base of school.

760
00:47:33.92 --> 00:47:35.92
And that's seven, how, how the class, how many?

761
00:47:35.92 --> 00:47:37.92
About 240.

762
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:38.92
Okay.

763
00:47:38.92 --> 00:47:41.92
So, it seems like you were better at the field craft

764
00:47:41.92 --> 00:47:42.92
and you weren't the academic.

765
00:47:42.92 --> 00:47:45.92
Well, this is true.

766
00:47:45.92 --> 00:47:48.92
In fact, in fact, you know, I got shot in the head

767
00:47:48.92 --> 00:47:50.92
and I have classmates who said,

768
00:47:50.92 --> 00:47:52.92
who's still saying that this day,

769
00:47:52.92 --> 00:47:55.92
we think that made you smarter, because I did go on

770
00:47:55.92 --> 00:47:58.92
to graduate school and get a master's in a PhD,

771
00:47:58.92 --> 00:48:02.92
you know, after I was retired out of the Marine Corps.

772
00:48:02.92 --> 00:48:05.92
And maybe there's something to that I don't know.

773
00:48:05.92 --> 00:48:09.92
So then, so the basic school is, what, six months long?

774
00:48:09.92 --> 00:48:11.92
About five and a half then, yeah, they were shorten it up.

775
00:48:11.92 --> 00:48:14.92
Five and a half months long, you get done with the basic school,

776
00:48:14.92 --> 00:48:16.92
you get infantry, right?

777
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:18.92
And then what happens?

778
00:48:18.92 --> 00:48:21.92
I got selected for reconnaissance replacement training,

779
00:48:21.92 --> 00:48:24.92
which was a couple of weeks in the Southern California,

780
00:48:24.92 --> 00:48:30.92
we get the Pendleton, again, from more supporting arms training

781
00:48:30.92 --> 00:48:34.92
in artillery, that sort of thing, air.

782
00:48:34.92 --> 00:48:39.92
And then a week at Caronado for learning about Naval Gunfire Support.

783
00:48:39.92 --> 00:48:42.92
Did you use the board?

784
00:48:42.92 --> 00:48:43.92
What is it called?

785
00:48:43.92 --> 00:48:44.92
The smoke board?

786
00:48:44.92 --> 00:48:47.92
Did they have the little fake terrain set up that you could call

787
00:48:47.92 --> 00:48:48.92
for fire on?

788
00:48:48.92 --> 00:48:52.92
I went to the Marine Corps Naval Gunfire School,

789
00:48:52.92 --> 00:48:54.92
and they had this terrain board.

790
00:48:54.92 --> 00:48:59.92
And it was kind of like a, it must have been built in like 1975.

791
00:48:59.92 --> 00:49:01.92
And when you'd call for fire, if you got in the right spot,

792
00:49:01.92 --> 00:49:04.92
little smoke would come up through that spot.

793
00:49:04.92 --> 00:49:06.92
And it was like you were looking at, you know,

794
00:49:06.92 --> 00:49:09.92
if you were looking at the fire, then it was like,

795
00:49:09.92 --> 00:49:12.92
well, it was a really good fire.

796
00:49:12.92 --> 00:49:15.92
So, it was a very good fire.

797
00:49:15.92 --> 00:49:17.92
I never saw anything like that.

798
00:49:17.92 --> 00:49:22.92
I mean, we were actually filing firing real high-vartillery at

799
00:49:22.92 --> 00:49:24.92
Pendleton.

800
00:49:24.92 --> 00:49:27.92
And at the Naval Gunfire Support school, we had this big board,

801
00:49:27.92 --> 00:49:29.92
but it was blue.

802
00:49:29.92 --> 00:49:32.92
It was ships in the ocean per se.

803
00:49:32.92 --> 00:49:34.92
But that was interesting because I did one night

804
00:49:34.92 --> 00:49:38.92
and we had them, which was fun.

805
00:49:38.92 --> 00:49:42.92
You know, like the couldn't use their six inch guns because they're too flat.

806
00:49:42.92 --> 00:49:44.92
So they used their five inch, you know,

807
00:49:44.92 --> 00:49:45.92
bringing in direct fire on.

808
00:49:45.92 --> 00:49:47.92
We had a bunch of lights below us.

809
00:49:47.92 --> 00:49:51.92
I think folks were trying to move, move their troops around in middle and night.

810
00:49:51.92 --> 00:49:55.92
But, you know, this was on call for, so we used it.

811
00:49:55.92 --> 00:49:57.92
So you got to use the Naval Gunfire.

812
00:49:57.92 --> 00:50:00.92
That's like a dream of mine.

813
00:50:00.92 --> 00:50:03.92
In a reverse sense, I sat there on that little terrain board.

814
00:50:03.92 --> 00:50:04.92
It was a dream of mine.

815
00:50:04.92 --> 00:50:08.92
And I got to use my Bravo Zulu term at the end of it.

816
00:50:08.92 --> 00:50:09.92
I don't think I'm further fine.

817
00:50:09.92 --> 00:50:12.92
The real Bravo Zulu.

818
00:50:12.92 --> 00:50:14.92
That is outstanding.

819
00:50:14.92 --> 00:50:15.92
That is outstanding.

820
00:50:15.92 --> 00:50:20.92
I never even, I never even got close to even remotely thinking about calling for

821
00:50:20.92 --> 00:50:22.92
Naval Gunfire for real.

822
00:50:22.92 --> 00:50:26.92
So I probably weren't too close to, you know, big waterways.

823
00:50:26.92 --> 00:50:27.92
Yeah.

824
00:50:27.92 --> 00:50:28.92
Yeah.

825
00:50:28.92 --> 00:50:29.92
I don't know.

826
00:50:29.92 --> 00:50:32.92
There's always that thing where guys want to fire, you know, a bunch of different weapons.

827
00:50:32.92 --> 00:50:34.92
In combat, right?

828
00:50:34.92 --> 00:50:39.92
And I had one guy get shot in the chest, but hit him in the chest plate.

829
00:50:39.92 --> 00:50:44.92
So I wasn't with him, but they actually had video of that.

830
00:50:44.92 --> 00:50:46.92
So you get shot in the chest plate.

831
00:50:46.92 --> 00:50:47.92
And so he's all mad.

832
00:50:47.92 --> 00:50:50.92
He's mad and he shoots a bunch of machine gun rounds.

833
00:50:50.92 --> 00:50:53.92
And someone goes, hey, shoot your pistol out of two.

834
00:50:53.92 --> 00:50:54.92
Maybe he goes.

835
00:50:54.92 --> 00:50:55.92
He looks out of like, why?

836
00:50:55.92 --> 00:50:57.92
And he says, we're going to make you feel better.

837
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:00.92
So he pulls his pistol out and shoots that too.

838
00:51:00.92 --> 00:51:03.92
But I'm sure if you would have had Naval Gunfire, who knows?

839
00:51:03.92 --> 00:51:05.92
Maybe he would have gone for it.

840
00:51:05.92 --> 00:51:07.92
I don't know about the pistol.

841
00:51:07.92 --> 00:51:11.92
You know, when we fired the 45 or 12 occasion,

842
00:51:11.92 --> 00:51:15.92
down at TBS, I think our instructor actually told us, you know,

843
00:51:15.92 --> 00:51:18.92
in combat, if this is all you've got, you know,

844
00:51:18.92 --> 00:51:22.92
you're probably just better off throwing the pistol at him

845
00:51:22.92 --> 00:51:25.92
and shooting at him because you have a better chance of hitting him.

846
00:51:25.92 --> 00:51:27.92
You know, the bad guy on the other end.

847
00:51:27.92 --> 00:51:30.92
Did you guys not have infantry officer course back then?

848
00:51:30.92 --> 00:51:35.92
Because that's like a, you know, multi month course now after TBS.

849
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:37.92
We did not.

850
00:51:37.92 --> 00:51:40.92
You were, you're considered good to go, you know,

851
00:51:40.92 --> 00:51:43.92
after graduation on TBS, you know, now they have a 10 week

852
00:51:43.92 --> 00:51:47.92
officer or infantry officer training course,

853
00:51:47.92 --> 00:51:52.92
which I think would have been outstanding, but we had what we had.

854
00:51:52.92 --> 00:51:55.92
So, so you go to this, you go to this

855
00:51:55.92 --> 00:51:58.92
and you go to this, this recon course.

856
00:51:58.92 --> 00:52:02.92
And so now, are you getting jump, jump paying all that stuff now?

857
00:52:02.92 --> 00:52:05.92
No, you know, even though it was jumped qualified,

858
00:52:05.92 --> 00:52:08.92
if you're, if you're not in a unit that maintains

859
00:52:08.92 --> 00:52:11.92
your jump qualification in the core, you don't get jump pay.

860
00:52:11.92 --> 00:52:15.92
In fact, we've got to be at now in first recon battalion.

861
00:52:15.92 --> 00:52:18.92
There was only one company, you know,

862
00:52:18.92 --> 00:52:20.92
that maintain their jump status.

863
00:52:20.92 --> 00:52:23.92
That was Charlie Company and they were the force recon company.

864
00:52:23.92 --> 00:52:27.92
They did the same thing as battalion recon companies did,

865
00:52:27.92 --> 00:52:29.92
but they did maintain their jump status.

866
00:52:29.92 --> 00:52:33.92
That's all they got jump pay and ever extra 75 bucks a month,

867
00:52:33.92 --> 00:52:35.92
which was a big deal back then.

868
00:52:35.92 --> 00:52:39.92
So you end up, you end up going through this recon training

869
00:52:39.92 --> 00:52:40.92
and then what happens?

870
00:52:40.92 --> 00:52:43.92
And it's time to, is it time to deploy to, you know,

871
00:52:43.92 --> 00:52:45.92
a time to get on a bus and head up to,

872
00:52:45.92 --> 00:52:48.92
uh, air force space and sandburner, you know,

873
00:52:48.92 --> 00:52:49.92
don't know the name of it, but yeah,

874
00:52:49.92 --> 00:52:53.92
flow over to Ocanawa, spend a week there

875
00:52:53.92 --> 00:52:55.92
so they kind of drove the dribble to in.

876
00:52:55.92 --> 00:52:59.92
Uh, are you with, are you with, uh,

877
00:52:59.92 --> 00:53:01.92
all different branches of servicemen,

878
00:53:01.92 --> 00:53:02.92
are you just with Marines at this point?

879
00:53:02.92 --> 00:53:05.92
Just with Marines at this point, you know,

880
00:53:05.92 --> 00:53:08.92
going over, flew on Saturn, Airlines,

881
00:53:08.92 --> 00:53:12.92
I believe, you know, a non-scheduled, non-sched Airlines to Ocanawa.

882
00:53:12.92 --> 00:53:14.92
Oh, just like civilian was there civilian,

883
00:53:14.92 --> 00:53:17.92
uh, what do they call hostices?

884
00:53:17.92 --> 00:53:19.92
Students, students, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

885
00:53:19.92 --> 00:53:20.92
a few students.

886
00:53:20.92 --> 00:53:21.92
Flight attendants.

887
00:53:21.92 --> 00:53:23.92
Flight attendants.

888
00:53:23.92 --> 00:53:28.92
But, uh, typically, you wouldn't have anything to do in Ocanawa,

889
00:53:28.92 --> 00:53:31.92
while you waited for your, for your assignment to be

890
00:53:31.92 --> 00:53:33.92
flown into country, but, uh,

891
00:53:33.92 --> 00:53:35.92
when I got to Ocanawa,

892
00:53:35.92 --> 00:53:38.92
there was about five of us that were traveling together.

893
00:53:38.92 --> 00:53:41.92
We had been at the recon replacement training together.

894
00:53:41.92 --> 00:53:44.92
And, uh, we were just milling around the,

895
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:48.92
receiving area after we got off the plane.

896
00:53:48.92 --> 00:53:51.92
And, uh, somehow I got up above it,

897
00:53:51.92 --> 00:53:54.92
somehow I'm higher up than the crowd below me,

898
00:53:54.92 --> 00:53:55.92
and I'm watching it.

899
00:53:55.92 --> 00:53:58.92
And, uh, there's this young, uh, last corporal,

900
00:53:58.92 --> 00:54:02.92
where the clipboard, he's going to each of the second tenets that I had,

901
00:54:02.92 --> 00:54:04.92
you know, my buddies and asked him some question,

902
00:54:04.92 --> 00:54:06.92
and they're going, you know,

903
00:54:06.92 --> 00:54:10.92
so I said, I said, this poor kid, you know,

904
00:54:10.92 --> 00:54:13.92
I've been in this position before, so I'll find out what's going on.

905
00:54:13.92 --> 00:54:16.92
So he, he, but he needed his, uh,

906
00:54:16.92 --> 00:54:18.92
his company gunning or something.

907
00:54:18.92 --> 00:54:19.92
It sent him down.

908
00:54:19.92 --> 00:54:23.92
He needed a signature from an officer to run three plain loads of

909
00:54:23.92 --> 00:54:28.92
Marines through a little program on an Ocanawa,

910
00:54:28.92 --> 00:54:30.92
where the, your fam fire, the M16,

911
00:54:30.92 --> 00:54:36.92
because none of us had ever seen an M16 much less fired one before we went into Vietnam.

912
00:54:36.92 --> 00:54:38.92
And so you had fam fire familiarase,

913
00:54:38.92 --> 00:54:41.92
from a, familiarize yourself fire,

914
00:54:41.92 --> 00:54:45.92
the M16 before he went in country, made sure all your shots were up to date,

915
00:54:45.92 --> 00:54:48.92
and all of, all your paperwork was up to date.

916
00:54:48.92 --> 00:54:51.92
So I said, sure, you know, so I signed for him.

917
00:54:51.92 --> 00:54:52.92
I'd have to get up every night.

918
00:54:52.92 --> 00:54:55.92
There were other night, while I was there for about a week,

919
00:54:55.92 --> 00:54:58.92
meet incoming plane at about 2 a.m. in the morning.

920
00:54:58.92 --> 00:55:01.92
Find the senior, or a lesser guy on the plane.

921
00:55:01.92 --> 00:55:04.92
Form these guys up, take them over to a barracks,

922
00:55:04.92 --> 00:55:06.92
had him draw a mattress, you know,

923
00:55:06.92 --> 00:55:08.92
flopped down, told him to be in the,

924
00:55:08.92 --> 00:55:11.92
he had X morning at 7.30 a.m. in the morning, go to the chair,

925
00:55:11.92 --> 00:55:16.92
and then we started him through the little program that you had to go through before you could get in country.

926
00:55:16.92 --> 00:55:21.92
So I met my three planes in a little more than a week's time.

927
00:55:21.92 --> 00:55:27.92
I was desperately afraid, my, my after buddies were going to rotate into country before I did.

928
00:55:27.92 --> 00:55:29.92
Didn't happen, we all went off together.

929
00:55:29.92 --> 00:55:31.92
But anyway, it's an interesting week.

930
00:55:31.92 --> 00:55:33.92
Would you shoot in the basic school, M14?

931
00:55:33.92 --> 00:55:35.92
M14, you know.

932
00:55:35.92 --> 00:55:38.92
How'd you feel about the M16 when you got it?

933
00:55:38.92 --> 00:55:40.92
I loved it.

934
00:55:40.92 --> 00:55:42.92
Lightweight, the Amos lightweight.

935
00:55:42.92 --> 00:55:47.92
Unfortunately, most Marines, and we got now found out that I had pitted barrels.

936
00:55:47.92 --> 00:55:50.92
And sure enough, I had to trade mine in, you know,

937
00:55:50.92 --> 00:55:52.92
I'm not the two after I got there.

938
00:55:52.92 --> 00:55:56.92
One, one that was a newer one with a good barrel in it.

939
00:55:56.92 --> 00:55:59.92
That's crazy, you guys didn't even get, you even shoot that weapon.

940
00:55:59.92 --> 00:56:01.92
Oh, you got the old canal, that's right.

941
00:56:01.92 --> 00:56:03.92
And then was the other training course that you're giving you like,

942
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:07.92
like preparation for Vietnam, jungle navigation or something like that?

943
00:56:07.92 --> 00:56:08.92
Are you looking out?

944
00:56:08.92 --> 00:56:12.92
Yeah, you were just, you were just kind of on your own until you rotate it in.

945
00:56:12.92 --> 00:56:14.92
K-san was getting hot then.

946
00:56:14.92 --> 00:56:21.92
So, he's the, at least to go to some three-shack operations,

947
00:56:21.92 --> 00:56:24.92
shack of some outfit on Okinawan.

948
00:56:24.92 --> 00:56:28.92
And here the morning brief about K-san and kind of look at each other and think,

949
00:56:28.92 --> 00:56:31.92
if you still want to get sent there, new.

950
00:56:31.92 --> 00:56:34.92
No, no, no.

951
00:56:34.92 --> 00:56:37.92
So, then you spent that, so you spent that one as a week in Okinawan?

952
00:56:37.92 --> 00:56:40.92
About, yeah, but now you guys all fly over to Vietnam.

953
00:56:40.92 --> 00:56:41.92
Right.

954
00:56:41.92 --> 00:56:42.92
Where do you fly into?

955
00:56:42.92 --> 00:56:43.92
Don't act.

956
00:56:43.92 --> 00:56:45.92
And then when you get there, what's that process like?

957
00:56:45.92 --> 00:56:48.92
That person would get there in the evening, it's dark.

958
00:56:48.92 --> 00:56:52.92
Again, somebody met you, yeah.

959
00:56:52.92 --> 00:56:55.92
Took you off somewhere, you grabbed a mattress, flopped you down,

960
00:56:55.92 --> 00:56:57.92
and some barracks at the end of the runway.

961
00:56:57.92 --> 00:57:01.92
And you slept until the next morning with all this effort

962
00:57:01.92 --> 00:57:04.92
to take it off of the bobbie, no sleep.

963
00:57:04.92 --> 00:57:08.92
Did you have that stereotypical moment that people talk about,

964
00:57:08.92 --> 00:57:12.92
which is the guys that are going home, the guys that are rotating home after their

965
00:57:12.92 --> 00:57:17.92
year, and you see that the contrast between the new guys showing up with their

966
00:57:17.92 --> 00:57:21.92
brand new gear and the old guys that are heading home, and they look like they've been

967
00:57:21.92 --> 00:57:22.92
through Helen Bata.

968
00:57:22.92 --> 00:57:25.92
No, never saw anybody that was going home.

969
00:57:25.92 --> 00:57:29.92
You know, down at the Nang, airfield.

970
00:57:29.92 --> 00:57:30.92
Didn't see him.

971
00:57:30.92 --> 00:57:35.92
We arrived sometime in the middle of the night, and it was dark, and we had no.

972
00:57:35.92 --> 00:57:42.92
You know, you have that little kind of internal feeling of impending doom or dread,

973
00:57:42.92 --> 00:57:43.92
or something.

974
00:57:43.92 --> 00:57:45.92
I don't know what, it was maybe it's just that you're adrenaline popping, you know,

975
00:57:45.92 --> 00:57:49.92
that you're finally going to get in country, and you know, what's going to,

976
00:57:49.92 --> 00:57:52.92
you know, you're going to take incoming rounds while you're landing.

977
00:57:52.92 --> 00:57:53.92
No, it's just no.

978
00:57:53.92 --> 00:57:58.92
Yeah, it's a normal landing, you get off the aircraft, you know, somebody meets you

979
00:57:58.92 --> 00:57:59.92
as often as this way.

980
00:57:59.92 --> 00:58:01.92
I'll list you guys that way.

981
00:58:01.92 --> 00:58:06.92
Drew, your mattress is straight asleep at the rest of the night.

982
00:58:06.92 --> 00:58:08.92
Do you know where you're heading at this point?

983
00:58:08.92 --> 00:58:10.92
You knew the division you were going to.

984
00:58:10.92 --> 00:58:12.92
First or third.

985
00:58:12.92 --> 00:58:15.92
Third was up north in north, I core.

986
00:58:15.92 --> 00:58:18.92
First was down around around the Nang area.

987
00:58:18.92 --> 00:58:20.92
I know it was going to the first division.

988
00:58:20.92 --> 00:58:23.92
You didn't even know what you're going to get to the recon battalion.

989
00:58:23.92 --> 00:58:26.92
You went to division.

990
00:58:26.92 --> 00:58:30.92
The next day we went to division, we got introduced for commanding general for some reason.

991
00:58:30.92 --> 00:58:34.92
And we were required to sit down, give us a big book, rules of engagement.

992
00:58:34.92 --> 00:58:38.92
You had to read that sign that you'd read it and understood it.

993
00:58:38.92 --> 00:58:42.92
And then you got sent off to your unit.

994
00:58:42.92 --> 00:58:47.92
And about three of us were lucky enough to go to the reconnaissance battalion.

995
00:58:47.92 --> 00:58:51.92
They went off to regular grant units, infantry units.

996
00:58:51.92 --> 00:58:56.92
So when you get your assigned to recon, and then what do you do?

997
00:58:56.92 --> 00:59:01.92
You guys drive up there, you take a helicopter up there, how do you get up to your actual unit?

998
00:59:01.92 --> 00:59:08.92
The actual unit, first recon battalion was located just below and across the street from division headquarter.

999
00:59:08.92 --> 00:59:11.92
So yeah, you're walked down there.

1000
00:59:11.92 --> 00:59:19.92
And as I said before, we had the one company Charlie company that wasn't with the battalion in denying.

1001
00:59:19.92 --> 00:59:21.92
It was forward based at Foubaide.

1002
00:59:21.92 --> 00:59:24.92
There were the ones that kept up their jump status.

1003
00:59:24.92 --> 00:59:28.92
And one of my buds who had gone through the reconnaissance battalion,

1004
00:59:28.92 --> 00:59:33.92
I was slated to go up there because I was single up to the force reconnaissance company.

1005
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:37.92
And he asked if I would mind to give him that position to him.

1006
00:59:37.92 --> 00:59:42.92
If it was okay with the Colonel because he was married and expecting their first kid to go.

1007
00:59:42.92 --> 00:59:44.92
And he did that extra 75 bucks.

1008
00:59:44.92 --> 00:59:45.92
I would just happy to be there.

1009
00:59:45.92 --> 00:59:47.92
I said, sure, take it.

1010
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:50.92
If that's what you want, that's no big deal.

1011
00:59:50.92 --> 00:59:53.92
So he went up to force company and flew by.

1012
00:59:53.92 --> 00:59:56.92
I stayed there with the battalion in denying.

1013
00:59:56.92 --> 01:00:02.92
And then what was checking in like, I mean, you're showing up there, you're new guy.

1014
01:00:02.92 --> 01:00:03.92
These guys have been in country.

1015
01:00:03.92 --> 01:00:10.92
This is something that you know always surprised me about Vietnam is that you guys would rotate.

1016
01:00:10.92 --> 01:00:12.92
Well, just one individual individual right place.

1017
01:00:12.92 --> 01:00:13.92
Right.

1018
01:00:13.92 --> 01:00:18.92
For me, all my deployments were, yeah, it's going in and the whole night's leaving.

1019
01:00:18.92 --> 01:00:23.92
And so that's got to be a weird thing showing up as a new guy.

1020
01:00:23.92 --> 01:00:31.92
And there's a bunch of people that have been there for between, I guess, between two days and 360 whatever day.

1021
01:00:31.92 --> 01:00:38.92
I said, you know, I mean, my, my working premise when I got to be at NAM was that anybody who was there a day longer than I was.

1022
01:00:38.92 --> 01:00:42.92
Then I had been there and was a day smarter about the situation or day more experience than I got.

1023
01:00:42.92 --> 01:00:45.92
I was going to listen to this version, you know.

1024
01:00:45.92 --> 01:00:48.92
But, uh, interesting enough, my platoon wasn't even there.

1025
01:00:48.92 --> 01:00:52.92
They were a board ship with the float of battalion.

1026
01:00:52.92 --> 01:00:56.92
And we all, the Rink are always kept it up battalion, float off the coast of Vietnam.

1027
01:00:56.92 --> 01:01:01.92
They could jump in to an operation, you know, at a moment still to skip or take.

1028
01:01:01.92 --> 01:01:05.92
And they always had a, a reconnaissance platoon with them.

1029
01:01:05.92 --> 01:01:09.92
And they apparently used them pretty much as point for the battalion.

1030
01:01:09.92 --> 01:01:10.92
So that was not a plumb job.

1031
01:01:10.92 --> 01:01:15.92
But my, my platoon with its outgoing platoon commander was a board ship.

1032
01:01:15.92 --> 01:01:17.92
So I didn't see them for two weeks.

1033
01:01:17.92 --> 01:01:22.92
I just, I had nothing to do except I got tasked to sit on court marshals.

1034
01:01:22.92 --> 01:01:29.92
You know, I had the unit grades quarterly grades or something, something like that would or do.

1035
01:01:29.92 --> 01:01:35.92
I had to go, oh my guys, service record books and give them a grade for their performance over the last quarter.

1036
01:01:35.92 --> 01:01:38.92
Without knowing what I would have, having seen them.

1037
01:01:38.92 --> 01:01:41.92
You know, this was going to be used for promotions.

1038
01:01:41.92 --> 01:01:46.92
So I did the best I could, you know, I took a, in service record book,

1039
01:01:46.92 --> 01:01:50.92
how long the guy had been the core in country.

1040
01:01:50.92 --> 01:01:53.92
Had he been wounded.

1041
01:01:53.92 --> 01:01:54.92
What was the level of education?

1042
01:01:54.92 --> 01:01:58.92
And I signed a few points and then, you know, like, one to ten.

1043
01:01:58.92 --> 01:02:04.92
And then I added everybody's points up and I had a grade to give him.

1044
01:02:04.92 --> 01:02:07.92
And recommended the top three for promotion or something like that.

1045
01:02:07.92 --> 01:02:09.92
It was crazy, but I had to do it.

1046
01:02:09.92 --> 01:02:11.92
It's what you did.

1047
01:02:11.92 --> 01:02:14.92
We were just complimenting the brilliance of the Marine Corps.

1048
01:02:14.92 --> 01:02:17.92
I mean, you got a tell story like that.

1049
01:02:17.92 --> 01:02:21.92
Then, okay, so then did you eventually get flown out to the ship to be with them or did they know?

1050
01:02:21.92 --> 01:02:22.92
They came back.

1051
01:02:22.92 --> 01:02:23.92
They rotated back.

1052
01:02:23.92 --> 01:02:24.92
They rotated back.

1053
01:02:24.92 --> 01:02:25.92
They were just filthy dirty.

1054
01:02:25.92 --> 01:02:27.92
I think they came right from the bush.

1055
01:02:27.92 --> 01:02:34.92
And the tenant, I got to talk to for about ten minutes because he was, like, overdue to rotate out of country.

1056
01:02:34.92 --> 01:02:39.92
So he just, he just wanted to get a shower, you know, a uniform, and get back down to the Nang.

1057
01:02:39.92 --> 01:02:42.92
And what, what pearls of wisdom did he give you in those ten minutes?

1058
01:02:42.92 --> 01:02:46.92
He, he told me, yeah, who the best guys in the platoon were.

1059
01:02:46.92 --> 01:02:49.92
And who I think he thought I might want to peat my eye on.

1060
01:02:49.92 --> 01:02:51.92
And that was about it.

1061
01:02:51.92 --> 01:02:54.92
No, no tactical advice on anything.

1062
01:02:54.92 --> 01:02:55.92
Well, it's interesting.

1063
01:02:55.92 --> 01:02:57.92
You know, I always say the leadership is the most important thing.

1064
01:02:57.92 --> 01:03:02.92
And what he was trying to give you is a heads up on who he's like, who is the best guys and from a leadership perspective.

1065
01:03:02.92 --> 01:03:03.92
That's interesting.

1066
01:03:03.92 --> 01:03:05.92
He just wanted out.

1067
01:03:05.92 --> 01:03:06.92
I didn't just want to get out.

1068
01:03:06.92 --> 01:03:08.92
But I wasn't a hooch.

1069
01:03:08.92 --> 01:03:12.92
Yeah, you know, with other Lieutenant's second, first Lieutenant who's been there.

1070
01:03:12.92 --> 01:03:16.92
Now, anywhere from maybe two months to four months.

1071
01:03:16.92 --> 01:03:21.92
And they were filling me in on, on how to play, operate, how the deal operate.

1072
01:03:21.92 --> 01:03:25.92
Was there anything that surprised you that you were hearing from those guys?

1073
01:03:25.92 --> 01:03:29.92
Anything that, you know, you said, oh, I didn't really expect that.

1074
01:03:29.92 --> 01:03:31.92
Only thing that really surprised me.

1075
01:03:31.92 --> 01:03:37.92
I think once, once I got into Recon and got working with him was that.

1076
01:03:37.92 --> 01:03:41.92
Occasionally, you had to go out far enough,

1077
01:03:41.92 --> 01:03:44.92
if it didn't, anybody's artillery fan.

1078
01:03:44.92 --> 01:03:48.92
You know, you weren't on the rarely where we under the 105 fan.

1079
01:03:48.92 --> 01:03:50.92
And the 105 fan, usually.

1080
01:03:50.92 --> 01:03:55.92
And then there was Army 175, which were very scary.

1081
01:03:55.92 --> 01:04:00.92
Thanks because the, the word was, they could click out.

1082
01:04:00.92 --> 01:04:04.92
They could, you know, bump out out, click when they fired these things.

1083
01:04:04.92 --> 01:04:05.92
They were big.

1084
01:04:05.92 --> 01:04:06.92
We flew over one time.

1085
01:04:06.92 --> 01:04:07.92
I looked at them.

1086
01:04:07.92 --> 01:04:08.92
I swear they drooped.

1087
01:04:08.92 --> 01:04:11.92
You know, one 75 artillery base, they were huge.

1088
01:04:11.92 --> 01:04:13.92
I swear they drooped.

1089
01:04:13.92 --> 01:04:19.92
And then, of course, if you were out past the 175 fan, you had nothing but air

1090
01:04:19.92 --> 01:04:20.92
to call on.

1091
01:04:20.92 --> 01:04:23.92
And that leads to take about 20 minutes to get there.

1092
01:04:23.92 --> 01:04:29.92
And pilots never really trusted ground officers to, you know,

1093
01:04:29.92 --> 01:04:31.92
to bring them in correctly.

1094
01:04:31.92 --> 01:04:34.92
So they'd always want to fly out an aerial observory, you know,

1095
01:04:34.92 --> 01:04:38.92
on one of these little spit-kit planes, you know,

1096
01:04:38.92 --> 01:04:39.92
polar into back.

1097
01:04:39.92 --> 01:04:40.92
And I don't know what they were.

1098
01:04:40.92 --> 01:04:42.92
Ove tens, I think.

1099
01:04:42.92 --> 01:04:45.92
But that was kind of surprising because.

1100
01:04:45.92 --> 01:04:49.92
But our artillery over there was fantastic.

1101
01:04:49.92 --> 01:04:52.92
Great, you know.

1102
01:04:52.92 --> 01:04:55.92
They, on call of 24, seven obviously.

1103
01:04:55.92 --> 01:04:59.92
The best thing I ever fired was Marine Corps self-propelled eight-inch.

1104
01:04:59.92 --> 01:05:02.92
They were like a, look like a big tag with an eight-inch.

1105
01:05:02.92 --> 01:05:04.92
You know, fired an eight-inch shell.

1106
01:05:04.92 --> 01:05:07.92
But when they were accurate to the anti-degree, unbelievable.

1107
01:05:07.92 --> 01:05:10.92
But basically, artillery was excellent over there.

1108
01:05:10.92 --> 01:05:13.92
Save their bacon many a time.

1109
01:05:13.92 --> 01:05:17.92
So when you, it's been two weeks, your guys get back.

1110
01:05:17.92 --> 01:05:19.92
You take over a Splatoon Commander.

1111
01:05:19.92 --> 01:05:22.92
What's your intro meeting with the guys in the Splatoon?

1112
01:05:22.92 --> 01:05:23.92
What did you say to them?

1113
01:05:23.92 --> 01:05:25.92
Just kind of introduce myself.

1114
01:05:25.92 --> 01:05:27.92
Probably telling the same thing to you,

1115
01:05:27.92 --> 01:05:29.92
if you've been here one day a long time.

1116
01:05:29.92 --> 01:05:33.92
I have, and you've got a better idea where I think you do.

1117
01:05:33.92 --> 01:05:34.92
Talk to me.

1118
01:05:34.92 --> 01:05:35.92
I'm here to listen.

1119
01:05:35.92 --> 01:05:38.92
You know, I want you all to get back home.

1120
01:05:38.92 --> 01:05:42.92
Obviously, you know, intact and not tacked in as we used to say.

1121
01:05:42.92 --> 01:05:46.92
In fact, the five and a half months I was a Platoon Commander.

1122
01:05:46.92 --> 01:05:48.92
We only took one serious casually.

1123
01:05:48.92 --> 01:05:49.92
And that was me.

1124
01:05:49.92 --> 01:05:51.92
And I wouldn't have in any other way.

1125
01:05:51.92 --> 01:05:55.92
We were extremely lucky, but we were also pretty good.

1126
01:05:55.92 --> 01:05:57.92
We didn't do dumb things.

1127
01:05:57.92 --> 01:06:01.92
They were folks who would like harbor at night near a trail.

1128
01:06:01.92 --> 01:06:04.92
And hope bad guys would come down it.

1129
01:06:04.92 --> 01:06:06.92
Just so they could try to set up a hasty ambush.

1130
01:06:06.92 --> 01:06:07.92
No, no, no.

1131
01:06:07.92 --> 01:06:12.92
Once your troops knew that you were serious about their welfare,

1132
01:06:12.92 --> 01:06:14.92
we would have done anything for you.

1133
01:06:14.92 --> 01:06:16.92
And of course you do anything for them.

1134
01:06:16.92 --> 01:06:20.92
I had 23 brains of my platoon.

1135
01:06:20.92 --> 01:06:21.92
Maybe a couple of corpsmen.

1136
01:06:21.92 --> 01:06:26.92
They rotated in and out according to the will of the Italian age state.

1137
01:06:26.92 --> 01:06:30.92
The fire to see young men ever settle on a symbol.

1138
01:06:30.92 --> 01:06:34.92
I know most of the platoon commanders say the same thing, but these kids were.

1139
01:06:34.92 --> 01:06:39.92
Average age and 19 average education, ninth grade.

1140
01:06:39.92 --> 01:06:42.92
You know, but they were taught, maybe a pre-mult.

1141
01:06:42.92 --> 01:06:47.92
If I had told them that we've been tasked to flap the Hanoi,

1142
01:06:47.92 --> 01:06:52.92
drop in with a river raft and paddle up and free the folks out of the Hilton.

1143
01:06:52.92 --> 01:06:55.92
They would have been right there.

1144
01:06:55.92 --> 01:06:57.92
They were just great kids.

1145
01:06:57.92 --> 01:07:00.92
What was kind of normal?

1146
01:07:00.92 --> 01:07:03.92
Well, first of all, what was your first operation they went on with these guys?

1147
01:07:03.92 --> 01:07:07.92
Well, first thing that I did was turn out to be a.

1148
01:07:07.92 --> 01:07:13.92
TET 1968 broke on my first snap in patrol.

1149
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:17.92
They started to get you on a snap in patrol or two.

1150
01:07:17.92 --> 01:07:23.92
Before you started leading your guys, you know, you were just there as a two-bezerv and learn.

1151
01:07:23.92 --> 01:07:26.92
And your patrol leader might be an E3.

1152
01:07:26.92 --> 01:07:29.92
In my case, it was an E5, Sergeant E5.

1153
01:07:29.92 --> 01:07:32.92
And we got up this ridge line.

1154
01:07:32.92 --> 01:07:39.92
And after crossing this path, it looked like the E5 of people passed and we got now.

1155
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:41.92
It was smooth.

1156
01:07:41.92 --> 01:07:45.92
And we got up into bad bunch of brush and some rocks.

1157
01:07:45.92 --> 01:07:47.92
And we were looking up the ridge line.

1158
01:07:47.92 --> 01:07:50.92
And pretty soon at 4.4 NVA come.

1159
01:07:50.92 --> 01:07:53.92
We could go down down this highway.

1160
01:07:53.92 --> 01:07:55.92
So, 4.

1161
01:07:55.92 --> 01:07:57.92
And then there was 8.

1162
01:07:57.92 --> 01:07:59.92
Then there was 16.

1163
01:07:59.92 --> 01:08:00.92
32.

1164
01:08:00.92 --> 01:08:01.92
We stopped counting.

1165
01:08:01.92 --> 01:08:02.92
This is your first message.

1166
01:08:02.92 --> 01:08:03.92
Just the first.

1167
01:08:03.92 --> 01:08:04.92
Exactly.

1168
01:08:04.92 --> 01:08:05.92
And is this your Paltoon?

1169
01:08:05.92 --> 01:08:07.92
No, I was with just a few little long time ago.

1170
01:08:07.92 --> 01:08:08.92
I was just checking on.

1171
01:08:08.92 --> 01:08:10.92
And the leader, the Paltoon leader's knee five.

1172
01:08:10.92 --> 01:08:12.92
Well, yeah, the patrol leader was knee five.

1173
01:08:12.92 --> 01:08:13.92
The patrol leader's knee five.

1174
01:08:13.92 --> 01:08:15.92
Great young man, great young man.

1175
01:08:15.92 --> 01:08:19.92
And so, his rule of thumb was where there's four, there's more.

1176
01:08:19.92 --> 01:08:25.92
Because when we saw these four guys come out of the jungle down this ridge line, first thing was,

1177
01:08:25.92 --> 01:08:26.92
let's go sit up and ambush.

1178
01:08:26.92 --> 01:08:29.92
No, sorry, I said no, no, no, no.

1179
01:08:29.92 --> 01:08:30.92
Where there's four, there's no.

1180
01:08:30.92 --> 01:08:33.92
We stopped counting at 400.

1181
01:08:33.92 --> 01:08:35.92
And by now, we had artillery coming in.

1182
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:36.92
We had air on the way.

1183
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:39.92
We had an aerial observer up there.

1184
01:08:39.92 --> 01:08:44.92
We fired artillery all day, all afternoon into the night.

1185
01:08:44.92 --> 01:08:45.92
Into the evening.

1186
01:08:45.92 --> 01:08:48.92
We had a puffed magic dragon dropping flares with the,

1187
01:08:48.92 --> 01:08:51.92
jets coming in underneath it.

1188
01:08:51.92 --> 01:08:52.92
We were dropping Nae Pong and night.

1189
01:08:52.92 --> 01:08:54.92
Oh, it was unbelievable.

1190
01:08:54.92 --> 01:08:55.92
And this was your first time.

1191
01:08:55.92 --> 01:08:56.92
Were you doing the call for fire?

1192
01:08:56.92 --> 01:08:58.92
No, no, no, it was sergeant.

1193
01:08:58.92 --> 01:08:59.92
Sorry, I was doing it.

1194
01:08:59.92 --> 01:09:02.92
Yeah, I was there to learn.

1195
01:09:02.92 --> 01:09:05.92
And to the Pucker Factor was like this.

1196
01:09:05.92 --> 01:09:10.92
You know, guys would go on to one or two snapping patrols and never see anything.

1197
01:09:10.92 --> 01:09:12.92
But, and they might go to Vietong.

1198
01:09:12.92 --> 01:09:13.92
Yeah.

1199
01:09:13.92 --> 01:09:16.92
And they, maybe have a little too lousy of fair attitude.

1200
01:09:16.92 --> 01:09:18.92
And this was my welcome to Vietnam.

1201
01:09:18.92 --> 01:09:20.92
And I thought it was great.

1202
01:09:20.92 --> 01:09:23.92
I mean, we were dropping artillery on these guys.

1203
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:26.92
They were running down the path toward our position.

1204
01:09:26.92 --> 01:09:28.92
You know, and they were in the brush.

1205
01:09:28.92 --> 01:09:29.92
They're not on the path.

1206
01:09:29.92 --> 01:09:31.92
But they were in the brush.

1207
01:09:31.92 --> 01:09:32.92
We had brush.

1208
01:09:32.92 --> 01:09:41.92
We had rocks on like our north side and our, or each side of west side.

1209
01:09:41.92 --> 01:09:43.92
East side and south side.

1210
01:09:43.92 --> 01:09:45.92
West and north of just had brush.

1211
01:09:45.92 --> 01:09:49.92
There's, you know, North Vietnamese there in the brush coming toward us.

1212
01:09:49.92 --> 01:09:50.92
They're crying.

1213
01:09:50.92 --> 01:09:51.92
They're screaming.

1214
01:09:51.92 --> 01:09:52.92
You know, they're yelling for mom.

1215
01:09:52.92 --> 01:09:53.92
Whatever.

1216
01:09:53.92 --> 01:09:54.92
Whatever we could do.

1217
01:09:54.92 --> 01:09:56.92
And that fear North Vietnamese soldier.

1218
01:09:56.92 --> 01:09:59.92
And they were going to run right into us.

1219
01:09:59.92 --> 01:10:02.92
So it started bringing our children behind us.

1220
01:10:02.92 --> 01:10:04.92
A real club, you know, danger close.

1221
01:10:04.92 --> 01:10:07.92
So we got trapped in a flan over our heads.

1222
01:10:07.92 --> 01:10:10.92
And of course this, this dissuades.

1223
01:10:10.92 --> 01:10:13.92
These bad guys are coming toward us.

1224
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:18.92
And also we had a kid set up when they should have been laying flat like a mushy pancake.

1225
01:10:18.92 --> 01:10:23.92
Took a piece of shrapnel right into his face and knocked out a few teeth and cut open his lip and everything.

1226
01:10:23.92 --> 01:10:25.92
And the shrapnel was dropping down.

1227
01:10:25.92 --> 01:10:31.92
I had burn right through your, through your utility shirt, burn your skin.

1228
01:10:31.92 --> 01:10:33.92
You just, you just endured it.

1229
01:10:33.92 --> 01:10:36.92
It was a, it was a, it was a, it was a little hairy.

1230
01:10:36.92 --> 01:10:40.92
So danger close rounds coming your first night out.

1231
01:10:40.92 --> 01:10:44.92
And then he hit mom.

1232
01:10:44.92 --> 01:10:46.92
Oh, well.

1233
01:10:46.92 --> 01:10:48.92
Welcome to the war.

1234
01:10:48.92 --> 01:10:52.92
And you guys, and you guys maintain your, your, your, clandestine position.

1235
01:10:52.92 --> 01:10:53.92
Oh, yeah.

1236
01:10:53.92 --> 01:10:55.92
How many guys are out there with you?

1237
01:10:55.92 --> 01:10:57.92
Oh, probably about 10, 11.

1238
01:10:57.92 --> 01:10:59.92
That was a heavy patrol.

1239
01:10:59.92 --> 01:10:59.92
Yeah.

1240
01:10:59.92 --> 01:11:00.92
Wow.

1241
01:11:00.92 --> 01:11:00.92
All right.

1242
01:11:00.92 --> 01:11:03.92
So now at how many of those snapping patrols did you do?

1243
01:11:03.92 --> 01:11:04.92
Two.

1244
01:11:04.92 --> 01:11:05.92
What was the next one like?

1245
01:11:05.92 --> 01:11:06.92
Second, sure.

1246
01:11:06.92 --> 01:11:09.92
Well, next one was, was even, wasn't that interesting from a,

1247
01:11:09.92 --> 01:11:11.92
uh, or, a, a tactical point of view, but, uh,

1248
01:11:11.92 --> 01:11:14.92
It was going to be a lead by a lieutenant who had, uh,

1249
01:11:14.92 --> 01:11:17.92
got a little tanked up at the o-club the night before.

1250
01:11:17.92 --> 01:11:19.92
It hadn't given the patrol a patrol order.

1251
01:11:19.92 --> 01:11:24.92
Uh, so we're down there waiting for, on the LZ, waiting for the,

1252
01:11:24.92 --> 01:11:26.92
Insert helicopter, stop.

1253
01:11:26.92 --> 01:11:28.92
Get ready to take us off.

1254
01:11:28.92 --> 01:11:32.92
Come down the hill with the Battalion Commander, Lieutenant Colonel.

1255
01:11:32.92 --> 01:11:35.92
He, uh, comes over to our patrol.

1256
01:11:35.92 --> 01:11:37.92
Points of the Lieutenant sir.

1257
01:11:37.92 --> 01:11:40.72
to the tenets of pack, get back up, pack,

1258
01:11:40.72 --> 01:11:42.96
group here, you're going to the grunts, you know,

1259
01:11:42.96 --> 01:11:45.96
boom, he was out, Colonel Sesta,

1260
01:11:45.96 --> 01:11:48.76
I mean, it's Lance Carple, System Control,

1261
01:11:48.76 --> 01:11:51.40
I think you guys can run the special, yes sir, no problem.

1262
01:11:51.40 --> 01:11:53.80
So we did, it was great.

1263
01:11:53.80 --> 01:11:55.76
But, you know, shit can this guy,

1264
01:11:55.76 --> 01:11:56.72
he's just right there on the spot,

1265
01:11:56.72 --> 01:11:59.64
and you can do that in Enrique.

1266
01:11:59.64 --> 01:12:02.84
I had to do it once to one of my guys.

1267
01:12:02.84 --> 01:12:07.52
What the guy do that rated you firing him on the spot?

1268
01:12:07.52 --> 01:12:12.52
Um, I had, uh, my patrol was like cutting half,

1269
01:12:12.52 --> 01:12:15.80
I let my platoon was cutting half, I let half of it,

1270
01:12:15.80 --> 01:12:20.000
you know, anywhere from 8 to 10 guys, depending on who was,

1271
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.28
not on R&R, who wasn't sick, a red sort of thing.

1272
01:12:24.28 --> 01:12:29.48
And I had a platoon start, I, E6, Stassard,

1273
01:12:29.48 --> 01:12:30.88
he ran the other put down.

1274
01:12:30.88 --> 01:12:34.12
We flip flop about, uh, about half way,

1275
01:12:34.12 --> 01:12:38.36
through my tour, I was about five, five and a half months.

1276
01:12:38.36 --> 01:12:43.40
And so, you know, my, the guys I led,

1277
01:12:43.40 --> 01:12:45.68
we were, our codename was West Arnch.

1278
01:12:45.68 --> 01:12:50.20
We had an excellent, uh, reputation of a tie.

1279
01:12:50.20 --> 01:12:53.000
They were fast day, make, they felt like they were kind of

1280
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.60
distant cousins in the platoon, but I, I kind of got you

1281
01:12:56.60 --> 01:12:59.52
about Pep Talk tonight with, with the patrol order.

1282
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:01.68
So, you know, you guys are, I mean,

1283
01:13:01.68 --> 01:13:04.76
you guys are just like West Arnch, no different,

1284
01:13:04.76 --> 01:13:09.16
you know, again, my great education, same age, you know,

1285
01:13:09.16 --> 01:13:10.64
same skills.

1286
01:13:10.64 --> 01:13:13.72
And so, I went through my little spiel, you know,

1287
01:13:13.72 --> 01:13:16.08
my reputation, I'm a toned commander, you know,

1288
01:13:16.08 --> 01:13:19.44
administrative, or stuff, you know, how I operate.

1289
01:13:19.44 --> 01:13:24.44
Anybody doesn't want to, to go to a fast day now,

1290
01:13:24.44 --> 01:13:27.44
one kid raises his hand, so, okay, you don't have to go.

1291
01:13:27.44 --> 01:13:29.68
Pack it here, get out of here, don't, you know,

1292
01:13:29.68 --> 01:13:33.84
sleep in the night with these guys, you know, and I don't know

1293
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:35.48
whatever happened to him, because I never came back from

1294
01:13:35.48 --> 01:13:39.92
that patrol, you know, but I'm sure it was taken care of.

1295
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:42.36
So, when you start getting into, what was the kind of

1296
01:13:42.36 --> 01:13:44.80
typical mission that you guys were doing?

1297
01:13:44.80 --> 01:13:49.04
Typical mission was, you know, we'd go out on a six,

1298
01:13:49.04 --> 01:13:52.96
seven-day patrol, we're just, we're just snooping and pooping.

1299
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:54.68
That's what we call it.

1300
01:13:54.68 --> 01:13:58.000
Find in trails at the enemy would use race camps.

1301
01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.84
Would you guys insert on helicopter, would you guys just

1302
01:13:59.84 --> 01:14:00.36
foot patrol?

1303
01:14:00.36 --> 01:14:03.48
No, always hill it got per, you know, always hill it.

1304
01:14:03.48 --> 01:14:09.08
So, you pick out a spot and get dropped off and then what

1305
01:14:09.08 --> 01:14:10.12
was your, what was your S.O.P.s?

1306
01:14:10.12 --> 01:14:11.52
Once you guys got inserted.

1307
01:14:12.72 --> 01:14:14.48
We got up to hill it got, we start.

1308
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:19.56
Hopefully it was where the, the insert, L.D. was where, you

1309
01:14:19.56 --> 01:14:22.32
know, the operations officer or the operations

1310
01:14:22.32 --> 01:14:26.24
shack said it was, sometimes it wasn't there, but, you know,

1311
01:14:26.24 --> 01:14:29.12
that's why, you know, as a patrol there, first thing I did

1312
01:14:29.12 --> 01:14:32.72
to, and I got on a helicopter was dump my gear, get up my little

1313
01:14:32.72 --> 01:14:35.84
map and insert myself between the pile and the cop out,

1314
01:14:35.84 --> 01:14:38.36
because if you didn't know where you were, when you started

1315
01:14:38.36 --> 01:14:40.96
the patrol, you were gonna know where you were for the

1316
01:14:40.96 --> 01:14:42.20
next six, seven days.

1317
01:14:42.20 --> 01:14:44.80
Would you guys insert in the daytime in the nighttime and

1318
01:14:44.80 --> 01:14:46.20
the pre-drawn in the dusk?

1319
01:14:46.20 --> 01:14:47.20
When would you guys go in?

1320
01:14:47.20 --> 01:14:49.76
Would it go in in daytime?

1321
01:14:51.76 --> 01:14:55.24
We'd be down at L.C. waiting, you know, by about eight

1322
01:14:55.24 --> 01:14:57.92
o'clock in the morning, birds would come in if they weren't

1323
01:14:57.92 --> 01:15:01.56
being used for men of action stuff or some operation that was

1324
01:15:01.56 --> 01:15:04.72
going on, about mid morning, they'd do up and get a brief

1325
01:15:04.72 --> 01:15:07.92
from the intelligence folks at first streetcon.

1326
01:15:07.92 --> 01:15:10.20
We'd be sitting around there and they'd come back down from

1327
01:15:10.20 --> 01:15:13.96
their brief, we'd pop on the aircraft and off we'd go.

1328
01:15:13.96 --> 01:15:16.60
So like mid day, you're getting in there?

1329
01:15:16.60 --> 01:15:18.20
Mid day, yeah, yeah, I was pretty much probably.

1330
01:15:18.20 --> 01:15:19.20
Generally, yeah.

1331
01:15:19.20 --> 01:15:21.24
You hit the, and then what, you hit the ground and what

1332
01:15:21.24 --> 01:15:21.88
would you guys do?

1333
01:15:21.88 --> 01:15:24.000
As soon as you hit the ground, what was your, what was your

1334
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.44
standard operating position?

1335
01:15:25.44 --> 01:15:27.96
Yeah, so pay with the DD and get out of that L.C.

1336
01:15:27.96 --> 01:15:28.96
Fatsby.

1337
01:15:28.96 --> 01:15:31.96
Yeah, nothing says, Marines are coming in here,

1338
01:15:31.96 --> 01:15:34.68
then much of helicopters come in the land.

1339
01:15:34.68 --> 01:15:37.20
Would you be on two, two, Hues?

1340
01:15:37.20 --> 01:15:39.12
Now we'd be on a two, forty sixes.

1341
01:15:39.12 --> 01:15:39.80
Oh, okay.

1342
01:15:39.80 --> 01:15:41.12
Yeah, yeah.

1343
01:15:41.12 --> 01:15:43.28
Army had Hues, you know, transport troops,

1344
01:15:43.28 --> 01:15:46.76
Marine Corps did any time in a Marine Corps, they probably had

1345
01:15:46.76 --> 01:15:49.44
about 60 helicopters and we had an arm on Andy

1346
01:15:49.44 --> 01:15:52.08
give me a day about half of them would be airworthy.

1347
01:15:52.08 --> 01:15:56.84
So we had Huey gunships, he was, I guess, carry the brass

1348
01:15:56.84 --> 01:15:59.56
around, but we didn't use much troop transport, well,

1349
01:15:59.56 --> 01:16:00.28
forty sixes.

1350
01:16:00.28 --> 01:16:03.32
So, big old, forty sixes.

1351
01:16:03.32 --> 01:16:04.56
Big old, forty sixes.

1352
01:16:04.56 --> 01:16:05.56
All noisy.

1353
01:16:05.56 --> 01:16:06.56
Forty sixes.

1354
01:16:06.56 --> 01:16:09.76
I did, would you guys just like, we always used to do

1355
01:16:09.76 --> 01:16:12.24
something which was sit, look and listen.

1356
01:16:12.24 --> 01:16:15.72
So like, we would, you know, go two or three hundred yards

1357
01:16:15.72 --> 01:16:18.12
away from the L.C. and then we'd all do stop.

1358
01:16:18.12 --> 01:16:18.96
And then just listen.

1359
01:16:18.96 --> 01:16:20.84
Get down, yeah, pretty much the same way.

1360
01:16:20.84 --> 01:16:21.68
Yeah.

1361
01:16:21.68 --> 01:16:24.56
And when you guys have different areas where you were headed

1362
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:26.80
to specifically, we did.

1363
01:16:26.80 --> 01:16:30.92
We had a patrol route that was pre-planed and an extract

1364
01:16:30.92 --> 01:16:32.44
point that was pre-planed.

1365
01:16:32.44 --> 01:16:36.68
Now, and patrols rarely went, you know, according to the pre-planning,

1366
01:16:36.68 --> 01:16:40.28
which, you know, the operations shattered, you know, we didn't

1367
01:16:40.28 --> 01:16:41.12
do that.

1368
01:16:41.12 --> 01:16:43.84
So they were actually telling you where you were going to go in

1369
01:16:43.84 --> 01:16:46.52
at, but they have a recommended patrol route, which we'd

1370
01:16:46.52 --> 01:16:50.36
stick to if we could, couldn't all the time.

1371
01:16:50.36 --> 01:16:54.44
And then we'd get out at this point where they had recommended.

1372
01:16:54.44 --> 01:16:55.44
Yeah.

1373
01:16:55.44 --> 01:16:58.20
And again, sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't.

1374
01:16:58.20 --> 01:17:02.44
What was it, how often would you guys be contacted by the enemy?

1375
01:17:05.44 --> 01:17:11.04
You know, it wasn't all that frequently.

1376
01:17:11.04 --> 01:17:15.24
Because we did, you know, we were, we were snooping

1377
01:17:15.24 --> 01:17:15.92
poop with a bad smell.

1378
01:17:15.92 --> 01:17:18.56
But your purpose of being there was to not be right.

1379
01:17:18.56 --> 01:17:23.32
You know, in recon, you have one to, you know, find them,

1380
01:17:23.32 --> 01:17:24.32
fix them in FoxDot.

1381
01:17:24.32 --> 01:17:30.04
You didn't get online with nine or 10 guys or 11, maybe.

1382
01:17:30.04 --> 01:17:31.96
And say, charge.

1383
01:17:31.96 --> 01:17:34.56
Your idea was to gather information.

1384
01:17:34.56 --> 01:17:40.56
But if the situation was to your advantage, you could, you

1385
01:17:40.56 --> 01:17:46.24
could, you know, if the leader felt that it was worth the effort

1386
01:17:46.24 --> 01:17:49.000
set up an ambush, but in early we'd bring our children on.

1387
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.08
If we saw groups and I probably ran 21 patrols.

1388
01:17:55.08 --> 01:17:57.52
And I'd say probably good three quarters of them.

1389
01:17:57.52 --> 01:18:00.88
We had, we had fire missions on top of bad guys.

1390
01:18:00.88 --> 01:18:02.60
Oh, that's, that's it.

1391
01:18:02.60 --> 01:18:04.000
That's a high percentage.

1392
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.60
Well, I think what you're going through, what do you

1393
01:18:07.60 --> 01:18:08.76
earn your money?

1394
01:18:08.76 --> 01:18:10.84
Well, but there was, there were some of my guys in

1395
01:18:10.84 --> 01:18:13.48
your money that would get contacted a lot.

1396
01:18:13.48 --> 01:18:16.84
There was one group over in Eastern Ramadi.

1397
01:18:16.84 --> 01:18:18.52
And they did.

1398
01:18:18.52 --> 01:18:22.44
I was actually briefing a, I was briefing the CGISO

1399
01:18:22.44 --> 01:18:25.08
of Commander, who's the, the Colonel, that was the charge

1400
01:18:25.08 --> 01:18:27.000
of all special operations.

1401
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.84
And I said, you know, so the, my group that's, you know,

1402
01:18:30.84 --> 01:18:32.68
six seals that are over in Eastern Ramadi,

1403
01:18:32.68 --> 01:18:35.24
I said, they've been, they've been in enemy contact,

1404
01:18:35.24 --> 01:18:37.36
23 straight operations.

1405
01:18:37.36 --> 01:18:38.32
And I'm not kidding.

1406
01:18:38.32 --> 01:18:40.60
I didn't plan this for dramatic effect.

1407
01:18:40.60 --> 01:18:42.96
But my intel officer who's run in attack cooperation

1408
01:18:42.96 --> 01:18:45.08
and it comes walking in and says, hey, sir,

1409
01:18:45.08 --> 01:18:47.48
just want to let you know that the guys out Eastern

1410
01:18:47.48 --> 01:18:48.48
in contact right now.

1411
01:18:48.48 --> 01:18:50.60
And I looked at the Colonel, I said, make that 24 missions

1412
01:18:50.60 --> 01:18:51.44
in a row.

1413
01:18:51.44 --> 01:18:53.96
So there was definitely some hot, hot airs.

1414
01:18:53.96 --> 01:18:56.76
Yeah, it was pretty much expected if you were going out

1415
01:18:56.76 --> 01:18:58.84
in Ramadi that you were going to get in contact

1416
01:18:58.84 --> 01:18:59.68
by the enemy.

1417
01:18:59.68 --> 01:19:02.40
And I don't know what the percentage was, but it was,

1418
01:19:02.40 --> 01:19:06.52
it was a vast, it was very rare that my guys would come

1419
01:19:06.52 --> 01:19:10.68
back and head and shot their guns, you know, very rare.

1420
01:19:10.68 --> 01:19:15.68
Yeah, but, but 75, but I also, what was interesting

1421
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:17.28
when I came home from that deployment

1422
01:19:17.28 --> 01:19:19.16
and we talked to some of the Vietnam guys,

1423
01:19:19.16 --> 01:19:21.16
depending on the Paltoon, depending on the seal

1424
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:25.08
of Paltoon and Vietnam, there's guys that shot their weapons

1425
01:19:25.08 --> 01:19:27.52
on a six month deployment, shot their weapons three times,

1426
01:19:27.52 --> 01:19:28.52
four times.

1427
01:19:28.52 --> 01:19:30.92
And there's other Paltoon's in Vietnam

1428
01:19:30.92 --> 01:19:32.36
when they shot their Paltoon, shot their weapons

1429
01:19:32.36 --> 01:19:33.20
a hundred times.

1430
01:19:33.20 --> 01:19:37.36
So it all depended on, and my first deployment to Iraq,

1431
01:19:37.36 --> 01:19:40.68
I think I shot my gun, we got four or five fire fights.

1432
01:19:40.68 --> 01:19:44.000
So really, not that big of a deal.

1433
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.72
And then in Ramadi, the number is just very high

1434
01:19:48.72 --> 01:19:50.64
for as far as the whole task,

1435
01:19:50.64 --> 01:19:53.76
you know, getting into big gun fights.

1436
01:19:53.76 --> 01:19:56.72
But three quarters of the time, you know,

1437
01:19:56.72 --> 01:19:58.28
that's a lot of fire missions.

1438
01:19:58.28 --> 01:20:01.28
Well, but yeah, but they weren't gun fights per se.

1439
01:20:01.28 --> 01:20:03.60
You know, they be, you eyeball on some buddy

1440
01:20:03.60 --> 01:20:06.60
or some place or some trail cross-winger,

1441
01:20:06.60 --> 01:20:08.44
some little vill that you might come across

1442
01:20:08.44 --> 01:20:09.52
in the middle of nowhere.

1443
01:20:09.52 --> 01:20:12.16
One time we came across a corn field.

1444
01:20:12.16 --> 01:20:13.96
In the middle of the jungle.

1445
01:20:13.96 --> 01:20:17.000
I mean, it wasn't jungle per se

1446
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.16
because there was no high tree canopy over it,

1447
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:21.96
but it was just a field, a clearing in the middle of the jungle.

1448
01:20:21.96 --> 01:20:23.40
With rows of corn, nice.

1449
01:20:23.40 --> 01:20:28.52
But this is not your typical jungle plant.

1450
01:20:28.52 --> 01:20:30.56
So we'd get up a little higher ground,

1451
01:20:30.56 --> 01:20:32.44
we'd watch to see if anybody come,

1452
01:20:32.44 --> 01:20:34.28
okay, man, they're settled down.

1453
01:20:34.28 --> 01:20:35.84
There's a few hooches there too.

1454
01:20:35.84 --> 01:20:38.44
Whereabouts were you guys operating, it could be at all?

1455
01:20:38.44 --> 01:20:42.96
We are operating north, south, and west of Danang.

1456
01:20:42.96 --> 01:20:47.96
First, reconnaissance, Patience Mission was to patrol

1457
01:20:47.96 --> 01:20:51.36
the rocket belt around the airport of Danang,

1458
01:20:51.36 --> 01:20:54.88
but that wasn't particularly that far out.

1459
01:20:54.88 --> 01:20:59.72
So we'd have a lot further out looking for, you know,

1460
01:20:59.72 --> 01:21:02.88
main line NBA forces.

1461
01:21:02.88 --> 01:21:07.44
And, or where they camped out, the trails they used,

1462
01:21:07.44 --> 01:21:10.64
et cetera, et cetera.

1463
01:21:10.64 --> 01:21:15.48
But gun fights were relatively rare, which is a good thing.

1464
01:21:15.48 --> 01:21:17.52
You can't see anybody in the jungle anyway.

1465
01:21:17.52 --> 01:21:19.64
It typically just firing blind.

1466
01:21:19.64 --> 01:21:22.08
So that was one of the nice things about the M16.

1467
01:21:22.08 --> 01:21:25.32
It would put out a lot of fire for him.

1468
01:21:25.32 --> 01:21:27.12
And that's what you needed over there.

1469
01:21:27.12 --> 01:21:29.68
You didn't need to have you bulletin as a serene

1470
01:21:29.68 --> 01:21:37.52
leader to knock guys down, but the seven point six two or five point

1471
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:39.40
whatever was just fine.

1472
01:21:39.40 --> 01:21:41.40
Not what a 7.62, that was the big heavy.

1473
01:21:41.40 --> 01:21:43.40
Yeah, that's the important.

1474
01:21:43.40 --> 01:21:46.24
When you were when you would get these mission taskings,

1475
01:21:46.24 --> 01:21:51.28
kind of from above, above from the battalion,

1476
01:21:51.28 --> 01:21:53.000
they'd give it to you that how long

1477
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.64
would the planning cycle take for you guys

1478
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:57.24
to come up with a plan and do your briefing at all that?

1479
01:21:57.24 --> 01:21:59.40
That 24 hours.

1480
01:21:59.40 --> 01:22:02.80
Yeah, it wasn't hardcore boiler play.

1481
01:22:02.80 --> 01:22:07.44
No, no one near the detail that you all went through in Ramadi.

1482
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:13.92
But it was just, we were out six seven days back to her three.

1483
01:22:13.92 --> 01:22:16.16
So that was a regular schedule.

1484
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:20.12
You knew, the kids were already, the rains were already.

1485
01:22:20.12 --> 01:22:22.04
Their weapons were clean.

1486
01:22:22.04 --> 01:22:24.68
If we had done things that we needed to do administratively,

1487
01:22:24.68 --> 01:22:27.92
like go down to the gas tent, check all the gas masks,

1488
01:22:27.92 --> 01:22:32.08
stuff that had all been done on kind of the 24 hours in between.

1489
01:22:32.08 --> 01:22:33.56
Were you carrying the radio?

1490
01:22:33.56 --> 01:22:38.56
No, I had a radio man, primary radio man was right behind me.

1491
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:40.84
And I had a secondary radio man,

1492
01:22:40.84 --> 01:22:42.40
toward the end of the patrol.

1493
01:22:42.40 --> 01:22:43.44
And you're taking what?

1494
01:22:43.44 --> 01:22:45.28
Seven eight guys, 10 guys?

1495
01:22:45.28 --> 01:22:46.12
Something like 10 guys.

1496
01:22:46.12 --> 01:22:47.88
I usually went heavy.

1497
01:22:47.88 --> 01:22:48.96
So you're 10 guys?

1498
01:22:48.96 --> 01:22:53.08
How many damn batteries did you have to carry for an eight day patrol?

1499
01:22:53.08 --> 01:22:54.64
Would you get re-supplied?

1500
01:22:54.64 --> 01:22:59.28
Because we're using the 77, the prec 77 radio.

1501
01:22:59.28 --> 01:23:00.88
Well, I was one prior to that.

1502
01:23:00.88 --> 01:23:01.68
Well, we're not prior.

1503
01:23:01.68 --> 01:23:03.000
I get prick 25.

1504
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:03.84
The prick 25.

1505
01:23:03.84 --> 01:23:04.48
There you go.

1506
01:23:04.48 --> 01:23:06.92
Not necessarily the best thing, but it was pretty good.

1507
01:23:06.92 --> 01:23:07.64
Yeah.

1508
01:23:07.64 --> 01:23:09.08
The line is longer a line of sight.

1509
01:23:09.08 --> 01:23:09.76
Yeah.

1510
01:23:09.76 --> 01:23:12.56
But you must have had to carry a lot of batteries for that thing.

1511
01:23:12.56 --> 01:23:13.40
We didn't.

1512
01:23:13.40 --> 01:23:15.24
I mean, I just the radio man had extra batteries,

1513
01:23:15.24 --> 01:23:19.72
but we typically, you know, go through that much battery.

1514
01:23:19.72 --> 01:23:20.92
Man, I was a radio man.

1515
01:23:20.92 --> 01:23:22.40
And it was ridiculous.

1516
01:23:22.40 --> 01:23:24.28
The amount of batteries in the early days.

1517
01:23:24.28 --> 01:23:27.04
Because we got much smaller radio as they were on.

1518
01:23:27.04 --> 01:23:28.36
And then how about water?

1519
01:23:28.36 --> 01:23:31.24
Would you guys just refill canteens and rivers and whatnot?

1520
01:23:31.24 --> 01:23:35.80
We would if we could find water, but we went out on eight to 10 canteens.

1521
01:23:35.80 --> 01:23:38.60
Because you didn't know what are you going to find water.

1522
01:23:38.60 --> 01:23:41.64
And if you found it, you didn't know what was going to be portable or not.

1523
01:23:41.64 --> 01:23:44.08
But we were taken quickly.

1524
01:23:44.08 --> 01:23:48.20
Often I say, more often than not, in the mountainous type area, mountainous being,

1525
01:23:48.20 --> 01:23:50.96
you know, thousands of meters are higher.

1526
01:23:50.96 --> 01:23:56.32
And if we came across running water that was moving on, I thought it was fine to

1527
01:23:56.32 --> 01:23:57.32
save the drink.

1528
01:23:57.32 --> 01:24:01.80
And until I went to this one day school, put on a way.

1529
01:24:01.80 --> 01:24:08.64
Chief Quarman who talked about how the leech of Lyric would be, you know,

1530
01:24:08.64 --> 01:24:11.60
expelled into the water and just rub bubble down with the water.

1531
01:24:11.60 --> 01:24:15.16
Yes, after that, I had nine tablets every time we refill.

1532
01:24:15.16 --> 01:24:17.24
So never had any problems.

1533
01:24:17.24 --> 01:24:21.44
Have a food. Food, we had three in era, sea rats.

1534
01:24:21.44 --> 01:24:24.44
Did you say, Korean era, Korean era?

1535
01:24:24.44 --> 01:24:25.44
Oh, Korean era, yeah.

1536
01:24:25.44 --> 01:24:28.44
Yeah, you know, 1554, it would save my name.

1537
01:24:28.44 --> 01:24:31.32
Just playing sea rats and cans.

1538
01:24:31.32 --> 01:24:33.44
MRAs were brand new when I was there.

1539
01:24:33.44 --> 01:24:35.76
And we occasioned on two patrols.

1540
01:24:35.76 --> 01:24:39.56
I think that we managed to steal some MRIs from somebody in the army.

1541
01:24:39.56 --> 01:24:40.56
Find dining.

1542
01:24:40.56 --> 01:24:41.56
Yeah.

1543
01:24:41.56 --> 01:24:43.20
But see, they used water.

1544
01:24:43.20 --> 01:24:48.68
So it was a better meal, but they would use water.

1545
01:24:48.68 --> 01:24:52.84
So it was a 61 half a dozen of another.

1546
01:24:52.84 --> 01:24:55.72
And then would you guys patrol during the day and then lay up at night?

1547
01:24:55.72 --> 01:24:56.72
That's a firm.

1548
01:24:56.72 --> 01:25:01.96
It would be fine to nest just mean this fugitation at night and crawl in there.

1549
01:25:01.96 --> 01:25:02.96
And harbor.

1550
01:25:02.96 --> 01:25:04.96
It would be in a harbor site.

1551
01:25:04.96 --> 01:25:09.32
Did they use dogs to try and find you?

1552
01:25:09.32 --> 01:25:10.32
Nope.

1553
01:25:10.32 --> 01:25:12.24
And that we're still on dog and we're at NAM.

1554
01:25:12.24 --> 01:25:13.24
We're in the jungle.

1555
01:25:13.24 --> 01:25:19.68
And apparently, Rekond had taken out dogs and handlers in the early days.

1556
01:25:19.68 --> 01:25:23.88
And the dogs just couldn't handle the heat and the terrain.

1557
01:25:23.88 --> 01:25:27.84
So the handler would have carrying the dog out.

1558
01:25:27.84 --> 01:25:29.36
So that was a.

1559
01:25:29.36 --> 01:25:31.56
You guys bring claymores to saffron?

1560
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:32.56
We did.

1561
01:25:32.56 --> 01:25:33.56
We did.

1562
01:25:33.56 --> 01:25:34.56
We did.

1563
01:25:34.56 --> 01:25:38.40
We bought claymores and sometimes little antifersoned nomines.

1564
01:25:38.40 --> 01:25:40.36
Which sounded like a great idea.

1565
01:25:40.36 --> 01:25:43.56
And until the next morning, I would put them out.

1566
01:25:43.56 --> 01:25:44.56
Gotta go retrieve them.

1567
01:25:44.56 --> 01:25:45.56
Yeah, you gotta go retrieve them.

1568
01:25:45.56 --> 01:25:50.92
You gotta maybe have six mines out and they kind of like with five.

1569
01:25:50.92 --> 01:25:56.36
So we would be moving out in the opposite direction.

1570
01:25:56.36 --> 01:25:57.76
Claymores a good weapon.

1571
01:25:57.76 --> 01:26:05.24
So you're, it sounds like your, your optempo was like, go on a patrol.

1572
01:26:05.24 --> 01:26:08.000
You're out there for six, seven days.

1573
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.56
You come back, you rest, you refit.

1574
01:26:11.56 --> 01:26:14.44
You spend three, four days in camp, something like that.

1575
01:26:14.44 --> 01:26:15.44
Two or three maybe.

1576
01:26:15.44 --> 01:26:16.44
Two or three.

1577
01:26:16.44 --> 01:26:17.44
Yeah, yeah.

1578
01:26:17.44 --> 01:26:19.44
It's a pretty quick turnaround.

1579
01:26:19.44 --> 01:26:25.20
You didn't have time to settle in and get comfortable anywhere.

1580
01:26:25.20 --> 01:26:26.20
I did it.

1581
01:26:26.20 --> 01:26:27.20
It's back out.

1582
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:29.76
Were you guys just skinny as could be?

1583
01:26:29.76 --> 01:26:30.76
We were.

1584
01:26:30.76 --> 01:26:34.92
Yeah, I went over there waiting 150 pounds on here, 55 pounds.

1585
01:26:34.92 --> 01:26:36.72
Which was my way to enable Kevin.

1586
01:26:36.72 --> 01:26:40.56
Going back, I was 123 when I got back.

1587
01:26:40.56 --> 01:26:46.48
But part of that was the previous, like, 19 days, I remember I was shot like a back in

1588
01:26:46.48 --> 01:26:49.16
the States, I didn't eat too much.

1589
01:26:49.16 --> 01:26:52.48
I was being fed for one thing, and most of the time was red jello.

1590
01:26:52.48 --> 01:26:53.88
And that one real appealing.

1591
01:26:53.88 --> 01:26:57.68
I couldn't look at red jello for about five years after that.

1592
01:26:57.68 --> 01:27:01.000
Did you guys have any night vision at all?

1593
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.40
Like a starlight scope.

1594
01:27:03.40 --> 01:27:08.84
We had fixed positions that we would go to, for sometimes too long and much as two weeks.

1595
01:27:08.84 --> 01:27:14.16
And they were essentially high points, like a hill, a hundred meter high hill.

1596
01:27:14.16 --> 01:27:19.08
And they'd have a permanent radio, we had a permanent radio relay station on there.

1597
01:27:19.08 --> 01:27:24.52
And patrols would just rotate there every couple of weeks to provide security for that guy.

1598
01:27:24.52 --> 01:27:27.40
Because he was up there for like three plus months.

1599
01:27:27.40 --> 01:27:32.16
And on those, we would take, we had starlight.

1600
01:27:32.16 --> 01:27:35.84
We watched the valleys and stuff below us.

1601
01:27:35.84 --> 01:27:38.64
But never used a metmuch, you know.

1602
01:27:38.64 --> 01:27:44.88
You know, going out in the field that much, you guys must have really been, I mean, you

1603
01:27:44.88 --> 01:27:48.88
guys must have been really good and really efficient out in the field after doing a field

1604
01:27:48.88 --> 01:27:51.68
out after field out, after field out, after field out, after field out for six, seven, eight

1605
01:27:51.68 --> 01:27:53.16
days every time.

1606
01:27:53.16 --> 01:27:58.000
Did you feel like you guys were kind of part of the jungle at that point?

1607
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.40
Never, never felt really part of the jungle, but I'm sure I got more comfortable in it.

1608
01:28:03.40 --> 01:28:08.88
One thing that you always had to be very careful about in the work that Recon did was heat

1609
01:28:08.88 --> 01:28:09.88
casualties.

1610
01:28:09.88 --> 01:28:14.56
You know, you took a serious heat cattle, that's an emergency metaback, which is again,

1611
01:28:14.56 --> 01:28:18.84
you know, announcing the whole world that there's Marines out here and one of them, you

1612
01:28:18.84 --> 01:28:20.96
know, down with the heat catchment.

1613
01:28:20.96 --> 01:28:27.76
As a consequence, the days we were back in the area, first between Delta Company

1614
01:28:27.76 --> 01:28:31.64
and PTED every day, people thought we were crazy.

1615
01:28:31.64 --> 01:28:35.36
I took my heat catch on these on Freedom Hill Road, you know, running, two and a half miles

1616
01:28:35.36 --> 01:28:39.96
down, two and a half miles back, including myself, you know, stopping to barfer and never

1617
01:28:39.96 --> 01:28:40.96
had a heat catchment.

1618
01:28:40.96 --> 01:28:45.20
And the five and a half months, I went to throw something very proud of.

1619
01:28:45.20 --> 01:28:49.76
Yeah, you got to carry enough water for that though.

1620
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:50.76
Really, right?

1621
01:28:50.76 --> 01:28:56.000
You know, you just had to ration yourself, you know, and each individual will see that

1622
01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.08
eight can teams you bring an eight can team to warm up, and that's going to last you eight

1623
01:29:00.08 --> 01:29:01.08
days.

1624
01:29:01.08 --> 01:29:02.08
Sixth or six.

1625
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:03.08
Sixth or six.

1626
01:29:03.08 --> 01:29:06.36
That's what you got to extend it, which was not on her go.

1627
01:29:06.36 --> 01:29:10.80
You know, the Marine Corps helicopter would be, you know, some operation would start while

1628
01:29:10.80 --> 01:29:14.48
you were on patrol, they'd be tasked for metabacks and you couldn't get out the day

1629
01:29:14.48 --> 01:29:17.48
you were supposed to.

1630
01:29:17.48 --> 01:29:23.36
You prayed, I guess, would be the nice thing to say that you got out the next day, because

1631
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:28.84
by then your food was exhausted, your water was either gone or sheel short.

1632
01:29:28.84 --> 01:29:30.68
Yeah, we used to have a lot.

1633
01:29:30.68 --> 01:29:35.08
We used to have a heat casualties in training out here in Calgary, in Calgary, in

1634
01:29:35.08 --> 01:29:37.80
Piero Valley where it's 120 degrees.

1635
01:29:37.80 --> 01:29:38.80
And it's tough.

1636
01:29:38.80 --> 01:29:44.56
And like you said, a guy can go from he's fine to all of a sudden he's like a legitimate

1637
01:29:44.56 --> 01:29:46.56
like a legitimate casualty.

1638
01:29:46.56 --> 01:29:47.56
That's right.

1639
01:29:47.56 --> 01:29:51.28
Yeah.

1640
01:29:51.28 --> 01:29:54.48
Let's go to July 4th, 1968.

1641
01:29:54.48 --> 01:29:57.48
What was going into that operation?

1642
01:29:57.48 --> 01:30:01.16
What was the overall operation that you guys were looking to do?

1643
01:30:01.16 --> 01:30:08.96
We were looking to find an old LZ, a place called Charlie Ridge, you said you had neighborhoods

1644
01:30:08.96 --> 01:30:11.52
in this area that were hotter than others.

1645
01:30:11.52 --> 01:30:14.80
And reminded we had the same thing of course we got them.

1646
01:30:14.80 --> 01:30:17.96
Some places were known as hot spots, you had almost guaranteed, you know, somebody's

1647
01:30:17.96 --> 01:30:22.52
going to shoot a few rounds at you coming in or going out if they didn't find it during

1648
01:30:22.52 --> 01:30:26.24
the, you didn't find them during your patrol.

1649
01:30:26.24 --> 01:30:29.20
But we were supposed to flip flop.

1650
01:30:29.20 --> 01:30:33.92
We'd go in and another team would come out on the top of this mountain and the team had

1651
01:30:33.92 --> 01:30:36.20
gotten lost.

1652
01:30:36.20 --> 01:30:38.48
They didn't know where they were.

1653
01:30:38.48 --> 01:30:46.24
So they finally somehow scraped their Sierra together and we went out.

1654
01:30:46.24 --> 01:30:50.64
We flipped flop with them, but we were way far away from this thing and we were three

1655
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:54.56
or four thousand meters away from this mountain top where we were supposed to flip flop

1656
01:30:54.56 --> 01:30:56.16
with another team.

1657
01:30:56.16 --> 01:31:01.16
So I really pushed the patrol to find this space, most of the really hard to find.

1658
01:31:01.16 --> 01:31:02.76
These guys couldn't find it.

1659
01:31:02.76 --> 01:31:05.08
No, no, they just were lost.

1660
01:31:05.08 --> 01:31:10.36
But we found that thing on the second day, old fire base on this top of this mountain,

1661
01:31:10.36 --> 01:31:16.12
you know, like three years of sea rats on the side of the mountain because we had NVA walking

1662
01:31:16.12 --> 01:31:19.68
trail below us, they'd stop and have lunch there.

1663
01:31:19.68 --> 01:31:24.32
He'd all see, I'd have ham and lime of beans, I think, supplied half the NVA and

1664
01:31:24.32 --> 01:31:28.60
Vietnam because it means just always pitched those to the, nobody, we call them ham and

1665
01:31:28.60 --> 01:31:29.60
mothers.

1666
01:31:29.60 --> 01:31:32.04
Nobody ate them.

1667
01:31:32.04 --> 01:31:35.40
But so we had a flip flop.

1668
01:31:35.40 --> 01:31:39.48
So I didn't want to get too far away from this LZ because I wanted another LZ within,

1669
01:31:39.48 --> 01:31:43.08
you know, three or four clicks.

1670
01:31:43.08 --> 01:31:48.56
So we were going to, you know, we harbored that night, moved off into the jungle outside

1671
01:31:48.56 --> 01:31:49.56
the LZ.

1672
01:31:49.56 --> 01:31:52.32
Harbored that night had some big rocks around us.

1673
01:31:52.32 --> 01:31:54.76
I thought we were going to get position.

1674
01:31:54.76 --> 01:32:01.08
And at night, I would pre-plot fires, you know, artillery targets north south east west

1675
01:32:01.08 --> 01:32:02.08
around our position.

1676
01:32:02.08 --> 01:32:04.88
In case you had to call them in the middle of the night, you know, you didn't have to figure

1677
01:32:04.88 --> 01:32:08.08
out what the, what's our sixth, you know, numbers here.

1678
01:32:08.08 --> 01:32:11.12
No, these targets were already plotted in.

1679
01:32:11.12 --> 01:32:15.52
So we walked up the next morning and we were just going to kind of lay a low all day long

1680
01:32:15.52 --> 01:32:16.52
in that area.

1681
01:32:16.52 --> 01:32:19.04
Wasn't something you really wanted to do.

1682
01:32:19.04 --> 01:32:23.000
But, you know, since we were scheduled a flip flop and, and, and, but Ty and really wanted

1683
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.36
us to do that because it hadn't worked, you know, when we had gone in, we weren't, we

1684
01:32:27.36 --> 01:32:29.56
should have gone in where we were going out.

1685
01:32:29.56 --> 01:32:32.12
Uh, but they wanted to flip flop.

1686
01:32:32.12 --> 01:32:36.28
So I said, but we're just going to lay a low for this day and we'll be out here next

1687
01:32:36.28 --> 01:32:37.28
morning.

1688
01:32:37.28 --> 01:32:44.84
Well, that morning, I guess some, you know, 12 men and VA reconpatreal walked a close

1689
01:32:44.84 --> 01:32:46.84
aboard or came by close aboard.

1690
01:32:46.84 --> 01:32:48.84
Uh, I never heard them.

1691
01:32:48.84 --> 01:32:51.28
Just they either saw flash a motion.

1692
01:32:51.28 --> 01:32:53.12
We must go, we were eating breakfast.

1693
01:32:53.12 --> 01:32:57.88
Uh, or they heard us, which I don't think they did because we were super quiet.

1694
01:32:57.88 --> 01:33:03.44
But all of a sudden, I just, you know, all this automatic fire opened up and, fortunately,

1695
01:33:03.44 --> 01:33:07.84
was over our heads, you know, because that's pretty typical happening in the jungle, a

1696
01:33:07.84 --> 01:33:09.04
shoot high.

1697
01:33:09.04 --> 01:33:11.60
But I had a big rock kind of behind me.

1698
01:33:11.60 --> 01:33:18.000
So I'm getting guys, maneuvered around starting to call the artillery and when, uh, a bullet

1699
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.04
apparently hits the rock behind me and comes about hits me in the head from behind, goes

1700
01:33:23.04 --> 01:33:24.04
forward.

1701
01:33:24.04 --> 01:33:25.92
I'm boom, I'm down.

1702
01:33:25.92 --> 01:33:28.04
And, uh, I'm almost history.

1703
01:33:28.04 --> 01:33:33.44
Uh, next thing I know, my, uh, corpsman is doing a pat down on me.

1704
01:33:33.44 --> 01:33:37.44
Apparently, the bullet had gone through my floppy cover and didn't knock it off.

1705
01:33:37.44 --> 01:33:40.68
And it wasn't till he saw a bullet, certain around down the side of my face that

1706
01:33:40.68 --> 01:33:42.56
they realized that the wound was up here.

1707
01:33:42.56 --> 01:33:43.96
But there was nothing visible.

1708
01:33:43.96 --> 01:33:44.96
So he's just going to pat down.

1709
01:33:44.96 --> 01:33:46.16
And I knew what that meant.

1710
01:33:46.16 --> 01:33:50.20
I knew I'd been shot and I knew he didn't know where it was.

1711
01:33:50.20 --> 01:33:54.28
But, uh, I never did figure out it was in my head or in the head.

1712
01:33:54.28 --> 01:33:58.80
I could clue that sometime that morning because we were on a ground for about another

1713
01:33:58.80 --> 01:34:02.000
four hours before they tried to get us out.

1714
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Uh, that had been bitten by a sentipede.

1715
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.80
It had some nasty sentipedes over there who has been apparently attacked your sexual nervous

1716
01:34:09.80 --> 01:34:10.80
system.

1717
01:34:10.80 --> 01:34:14.80
So that was my working theory that morning was that I had been by a sentipede.

1718
01:34:14.80 --> 01:34:16.20
Which was really piss me off.

1719
01:34:16.20 --> 01:34:18.60
How long were you on conscience for after you got hit?

1720
01:34:18.60 --> 01:34:19.60
I was hit.

1721
01:34:19.60 --> 01:34:20.60
I was hit.

1722
01:34:20.60 --> 01:34:21.60
I was hit.

1723
01:34:21.60 --> 01:34:22.60
I was hit.

1724
01:34:22.60 --> 01:34:23.60
I was hit.

1725
01:34:23.60 --> 01:34:24.64
I was hit.

1726
01:34:24.64 --> 01:34:25.64
I was hit.

1727
01:34:25.64 --> 01:34:26.68
You know when you saw a record scene, I mean fighting with Shane on aksmanman.

1728
01:34:26.68 --> 01:34:29.64
I'm like laying down on my lean mean, green stock of broccoli.

1729
01:34:29.64 --> 01:34:36.76
How much time, how much time it passed between the, uh, the initial fire incoming fire

1730
01:34:36.76 --> 01:34:38.64
and you getting hit.

1731
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:41.90
It was really as to matter maybe a three to five minutes.

1732
01:34:41.90 --> 01:34:42.90
Okay, you know.

1733
01:34:42.90 --> 01:34:46.28
Trying to get guys positioned.

1734
01:34:46.28 --> 01:34:50.84
In recon, we did not want to fire back.

1735
01:34:50.84 --> 01:34:53.84
Somebody started firing at you,

1736
01:34:54.88 --> 01:34:56.88
they didn't really know where you were,

1737
01:34:56.88 --> 01:34:58.44
especially with this fire going high.

1738
01:34:58.44 --> 01:34:59.76
And the last thing you wanted to do,

1739
01:34:59.76 --> 01:35:00.72
really was fire back,

1740
01:35:00.72 --> 01:35:02.44
is now we know where they are.

1741
01:35:02.44 --> 01:35:04.40
And then, you know,

1742
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:06.44
so the deal was not to fire back.

1743
01:35:07.44 --> 01:35:09.76
Just bringing supporting arms to a quick-achocud,

1744
01:35:10.84 --> 01:35:12.72
but eventually of course the guys started to fire back

1745
01:35:12.72 --> 01:35:14.84
because it was just a little too hot.

1746
01:35:14.84 --> 01:35:16.40
And I just thought of this,

1747
01:35:16.40 --> 01:35:18.60
I'm guessing you guys wouldn't carry,

1748
01:35:18.60 --> 01:35:20.000
like a heavy machine gun with you,

1749
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.40
like in M6, you or something?

1750
01:35:21.40 --> 01:35:24.32
No, we didn't too heavy.

1751
01:35:24.32 --> 01:35:29.04
And then we had two more guys tasked with ammunition.

1752
01:35:29.04 --> 01:35:30.88
And they can't really,

1753
01:35:30.88 --> 01:35:33.000
you know, I'm getting one of those things set up quickly,

1754
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.04
you know, I had a jungle, but occasionally we did.

1755
01:35:36.04 --> 01:35:39.28
Occasionally the warning water that I would get

1756
01:35:39.28 --> 01:35:40.52
from Battalion was like, you know,

1757
01:35:40.52 --> 01:35:42.16
you're taking an M6 on this,

1758
01:35:42.16 --> 01:35:48.16
which I hope a group had reports of X, Y and Z in this area.

1759
01:35:48.16 --> 01:35:50.08
And you might need it, so great.

1760
01:35:51.08 --> 01:35:53.44
Obviously, somebody had a volunteer to do that.

1761
01:35:53.44 --> 01:35:55.80
And my little guy, Smithman was mouse.

1762
01:35:56.92 --> 01:35:58.80
He would always walk very carefully, M6,

1763
01:35:58.80 --> 01:36:02.12
the great kid, great kid.

1764
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:04.96
Never really had to use it in the jungle,

1765
01:36:04.96 --> 01:36:07.12
which was good, but occasionally carry it.

1766
01:36:07.12 --> 01:36:09.40
So here you are, you're five minutes into this gunfight.

1767
01:36:09.40 --> 01:36:13.52
You get hit, you're unconscious for a very short period of time.

1768
01:36:13.52 --> 01:36:15.16
And then you come back too,

1769
01:36:15.16 --> 01:36:18.16
and how do you feel when you come back?

1770
01:36:18.16 --> 01:36:20.16
Again, it didn't what had happened.

1771
01:36:20.16 --> 01:36:21.000
I got it.

1772
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.52
My first thought was the centipede thing,

1773
01:36:22.52 --> 01:36:25.32
but the sounds were muffled.

1774
01:36:25.32 --> 01:36:27.04
Colour was gone.

1775
01:36:27.04 --> 01:36:28.32
Things were moving in black.

1776
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:30.12
Slowly and black and white around me,

1777
01:36:30.12 --> 01:36:32.60
and sounds were very muffled.

1778
01:36:32.60 --> 01:36:36.04
By now, the artillery started to come in.

1779
01:36:36.04 --> 01:36:38.84
We had a brand new second lieutenant with us.

1780
01:36:38.84 --> 01:36:40.52
He was on his first snap in patrol.

1781
01:36:40.52 --> 01:36:42.80
He apparently assumed command.

1782
01:36:42.80 --> 01:36:45.64
A long time my experience corporal, it was my,

1783
01:36:45.64 --> 01:36:47.80
normally was the patrol leader for this patrol.

1784
01:36:49.36 --> 01:36:53.32
And together they managed the situation.

1785
01:36:53.32 --> 01:36:54.76
And we got everybody out.

1786
01:36:54.76 --> 01:36:56.12
I was the only one wounded.

1787
01:36:56.12 --> 01:36:57.68
Take that back.

1788
01:36:57.68 --> 01:37:01.28
Crew chief on the hill of copper that picked us up was wounded.

1789
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:04.32
He was on a 50 caliber and got hit in the hand.

1790
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.60
But we were the only two wounded.

1791
01:37:07.60 --> 01:37:09.48
I was the only guy I met patrol wounded.

1792
01:37:09.48 --> 01:37:14.48
In the corpsman standing the same class hospital man.

1793
01:37:15.60 --> 01:37:17.60
He kept me alive for an extra four hour

1794
01:37:17.60 --> 01:37:19.60
until I could get me into the day.

1795
01:37:19.60 --> 01:37:21.72
How about were you bleeding?

1796
01:37:21.72 --> 01:37:22.84
Apparently, blood out.

1797
01:37:23.96 --> 01:37:26.40
There's a cavity down the center of your head

1798
01:37:26.40 --> 01:37:27.84
called a superior saginal sinus.

1799
01:37:27.84 --> 01:37:30.08
It's like an upside down triangle.

1800
01:37:30.08 --> 01:37:31.68
And it drains blood.

1801
01:37:31.68 --> 01:37:34.12
You brain and that was nicked by the bullet.

1802
01:37:34.12 --> 01:37:35.96
It was just close enough to midline

1803
01:37:35.96 --> 01:37:38.64
to nickless superior saginal sinus.

1804
01:37:38.64 --> 01:37:41.36
Like my car might just get put in battle dressing

1805
01:37:41.36 --> 01:37:42.88
after battle dressing on my head.

1806
01:37:45.16 --> 01:37:47.28
Every one of my whole day, Nail is saying,

1807
01:37:47.28 --> 01:37:50.12
were you passing back out and then waking back up?

1808
01:37:50.12 --> 01:37:50.96
I was.

1809
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:52.12
I was.

1810
01:37:52.12 --> 01:37:56.56
I remember I knew I could hear the helicopter coming in

1811
01:37:56.56 --> 01:37:58.76
and I knew we were about to break out of the jungle

1812
01:37:58.76 --> 01:38:00.40
to run to the sea.

1813
01:38:00.40 --> 01:38:03.60
The helicopter was coming in that we had been on the day before.

1814
01:38:03.60 --> 01:38:06.28
So I took all this strength I could to open my eyes

1815
01:38:06.28 --> 01:38:07.28
and look up.

1816
01:38:07.28 --> 01:38:08.80
And all the time, I saw our trazers

1817
01:38:08.80 --> 01:38:12.96
converging kind of over us from all the plugs of the company.

1818
01:38:12.96 --> 01:38:14.80
Damn, this is serious.

1819
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:16.36
Who?

1820
01:38:16.36 --> 01:38:18.04
You're, I got a, I got a,

1821
01:38:18.04 --> 01:38:21.56
some information that your kids gathered up.

1822
01:38:21.56 --> 01:38:26.24
And one of them, one of them was a note from Captain Frederick,

1823
01:38:26.24 --> 01:38:29.84
Rick, Jay Wilson, the third.

1824
01:38:29.84 --> 01:38:33.88
And he, you wrote this little kind of description of what

1825
01:38:33.88 --> 01:38:37.76
happened. He says, I was the pilot of the CH 46,

1826
01:38:37.76 --> 01:38:42.96
YT, TAK 13, M.M.H. 164 that rescued your team.

1827
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:44.80
What you couldn't know was that a lot of people,

1828
01:38:44.80 --> 01:38:47.60
including your recon team responsible for getting you to the hospital.

1829
01:38:47.60 --> 01:38:49.84
I vividly remember the mission because my crew chief

1830
01:38:49.84 --> 01:38:51.64
who's wounded, that's the guy you just talked about.

1831
01:38:51.64 --> 01:38:55.08
All right, he like you also survived and prospered.

1832
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:57.96
He and I received silver stars for our actions that day.

1833
01:38:57.96 --> 01:38:59.40
You tend to remember things like that.

1834
01:38:59.40 --> 01:39:02.16
I flew 928 missions in Vietnam

1835
01:39:02.16 --> 01:39:04.56
and that was my harriest.

1836
01:39:04.56 --> 01:39:06.80
I first heard that your team was in trouble

1837
01:39:06.80 --> 01:39:09.20
and you were wounded when I was landing at the Nang Hospital

1838
01:39:09.20 --> 01:39:10.64
with another metavac.

1839
01:39:10.64 --> 01:39:11.88
Because of your head injuries,

1840
01:39:11.88 --> 01:39:13.60
I was able to get a corpsman at the hospital

1841
01:39:13.60 --> 01:39:15.48
before I headed out for the rescue.

1842
01:39:15.48 --> 01:39:18.000
It turned out to be the corpsman Terry Galey

1843
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.96
was from my hometown of Wakefield, Rhode Island.

1844
01:39:20.96 --> 01:39:23.36
I found this out 20 years later when Terry's wife showed up

1845
01:39:23.36 --> 01:39:26.000
at my sister's house with an old copy of Stars and Strived

1846
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.84
that covered the mission.

1847
01:39:27.84 --> 01:39:30.68
Your team at Evidently ran into an NVA base camp

1848
01:39:30.68 --> 01:39:31.96
that no one knew was there

1849
01:39:31.96 --> 01:39:34.56
and was greatly outnumbered.

1850
01:39:34.56 --> 01:39:36.76
Because of your wounds and the combat situation

1851
01:39:36.76 --> 01:39:38.08
and extraction was requested

1852
01:39:38.08 --> 01:39:40.000
and I was the closest to the action.

1853
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.24
The problem soon became apparent

1854
01:39:42.24 --> 01:39:45.04
that the team needed to move about 200 yards

1855
01:39:45.04 --> 01:39:47.48
to an old bomb crater where I could land.

1856
01:39:47.48 --> 01:39:50.52
I called for gunship support and some fast movers.

1857
01:39:50.52 --> 01:39:52.48
What I got was four flights of phantom,

1858
01:39:52.48 --> 01:39:54.52
dropping bombs pretty close to the team

1859
01:39:54.52 --> 01:39:56.52
and four huge gunships.

1860
01:39:56.52 --> 01:39:58.76
I was circling overhead for about an hour

1861
01:39:58.76 --> 01:40:01.92
before the team got to the only feasible landing

1862
01:40:01.92 --> 01:40:03.36
zone on the ridge.

1863
01:40:03.36 --> 01:40:06.000
They did a good job progressing fire until I was landing.

1864
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.16
Fortunately, the bomb crater also protected me somewhat

1865
01:40:10.16 --> 01:40:14.24
and we were getting, we were able to get everyone on board.

1866
01:40:14.24 --> 01:40:15.72
I was a little short on fuel

1867
01:40:15.72 --> 01:40:17.000
but that worked on my favor

1868
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.08
because I was also about 2,000 pounds

1869
01:40:19.08 --> 01:40:21.56
over gross according to my copilot

1870
01:40:21.56 --> 01:40:24.08
who was wondering if we could lift off.

1871
01:40:24.08 --> 01:40:25.64
In the meantime, your team and my gun

1872
01:40:25.64 --> 01:40:27.56
are engaged in a firefight.

1873
01:40:27.56 --> 01:40:30.04
Your team knocked out all the windows on my bird

1874
01:40:30.04 --> 01:40:33.48
but I didn't object because they were covering my butt.

1875
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:36.68
We managed to take off and took a few hits out on the way

1876
01:40:36.68 --> 01:40:39.08
but thanks to the huge escorting me,

1877
01:40:39.08 --> 01:40:42.72
I was able to dive off the ridge and get out a range.

1878
01:40:42.72 --> 01:40:45.12
Long story short, we were able to get everyone

1879
01:40:45.12 --> 01:40:48.36
on a hospital and the NVA got a beating.

1880
01:40:49.88 --> 01:40:53.56
So he had to just take off and just fly over this ridge.

1881
01:40:53.56 --> 01:40:54.40
Right?

1882
01:40:54.40 --> 01:40:57.16
Yeah, apparently he just got a dove off the ridge

1883
01:40:57.16 --> 01:41:00.12
and he can't speak back up.

1884
01:41:00.12 --> 01:41:03.28
I heard that this thing was so riddled with bullets

1885
01:41:03.28 --> 01:41:06.20
this helicopter was that the Marine Corps

1886
01:41:06.20 --> 01:41:08.64
helicopter facility was across this highway

1887
01:41:08.64 --> 01:41:10.36
from the hospital in the neck.

1888
01:41:10.36 --> 01:41:11.80
They wouldn't fly it over there.

1889
01:41:11.80 --> 01:41:16.28
They called for a tug to toe it over there.

1890
01:41:16.28 --> 01:41:19.20
I'm gonna put that thing back in the air that day.

1891
01:41:19.20 --> 01:41:19.88
Right, man.

1892
01:41:22.24 --> 01:41:23.80
He continues on, this was a nice,

1893
01:41:23.80 --> 01:41:26.44
I'm taking bits of this from a nice letter

1894
01:41:26.44 --> 01:41:27.28
of Europa.

1895
01:41:27.28 --> 01:41:29.04
He says I understand that you count that day

1896
01:41:29.04 --> 01:41:31.40
as an alive day, which is a very good thing to celebrate.

1897
01:41:31.40 --> 01:41:33.20
I was probably one of the few Marines who enjoyed

1898
01:41:33.20 --> 01:41:36.36
their torn Vietnam primarily because I was saving lives

1899
01:41:36.36 --> 01:41:38.32
and rescuing your recon teams.

1900
01:41:38.32 --> 01:41:41.20
I also love the flying since they would never let you fly

1901
01:41:41.20 --> 01:41:42.76
like that back in the States.

1902
01:41:43.88 --> 01:41:45.28
One of the best things to come out of Vietnam

1903
01:41:45.28 --> 01:41:46.48
was the improvement of medical care.

1904
01:41:46.48 --> 01:41:50.68
Your proof that as a survival rates from Afghan,

1905
01:41:50.68 --> 01:41:53.60
as are the survival rates from Iraq and Afghanistan.

1906
01:41:53.60 --> 01:41:54.76
Hope you have a wonder.

1907
01:41:54.76 --> 01:41:57.84
Wonderful 50th rebirth, they happy birthday, Marine.

1908
01:41:57.84 --> 01:42:00.44
And that's once again, that's Captain Frederick Rick

1909
01:42:00.44 --> 01:42:01.76
J Wilson III.

1910
01:42:03.60 --> 01:42:05.12
He was the command pilot that day

1911
01:42:05.12 --> 01:42:08.04
and the bird that pulled me on the team out,

1912
01:42:08.04 --> 01:42:10.20
saved all our lives.

1913
01:42:10.20 --> 01:42:12.000
No question about it.

1914
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.04
We did, do you guys under the threat of being overrun

1915
01:42:15.04 --> 01:42:17.16
at some point soon?

1916
01:42:17.16 --> 01:42:20.20
I tried the truth, Jacob, I have no idea,

1917
01:42:20.20 --> 01:42:23.96
really, my memory of that day was pretty sketchy.

1918
01:42:23.96 --> 01:42:26.92
So I talked to him on the phone last year

1919
01:42:26.92 --> 01:42:29.44
and he said they had to circle overhead for an hour

1920
01:42:29.44 --> 01:42:31.20
because they just couldn't set it down.

1921
01:42:31.20 --> 01:42:32.44
There was no possible way

1922
01:42:32.44 --> 01:42:37.40
and they estimated probably 200 NBA on the ground.

1923
01:42:37.40 --> 01:42:39.76
And that's part of the reason why they weren't able to fly

1924
01:42:39.76 --> 01:42:43.84
back to squadron because small arms fire through rotor blades.

1925
01:42:45.40 --> 01:42:47.28
You know, as an imagery officer,

1926
01:42:47.28 --> 01:42:49.04
I always felt very comfortable on the ground

1927
01:42:49.04 --> 01:42:51.36
and very exposed on the helicopter.

1928
01:42:51.36 --> 01:42:53.36
I just figured those were things were flying magnets

1929
01:42:53.36 --> 01:42:55.60
made a lot of noise.

1930
01:42:55.60 --> 01:42:58.44
But of course the Aviator's felt just the other way.

1931
01:42:58.44 --> 01:43:00.84
They were felt safe in their birds

1932
01:43:00.84 --> 01:43:03.92
and were never wanted to be on the ground.

1933
01:43:03.92 --> 01:43:04.92
Never.

1934
01:43:04.92 --> 01:43:07.16
I feel the exact same thing as you.

1935
01:43:07.16 --> 01:43:09.60
I didn't ever like any sort of machine.

1936
01:43:09.60 --> 01:43:11.48
I didn't like any of them.

1937
01:43:11.48 --> 01:43:12.84
I wanted to just be on my feet.

1938
01:43:12.84 --> 01:43:13.68
Exactly.

1939
01:43:13.68 --> 01:43:17.20
So, and yeah, that feeling that you have an helicopter

1940
01:43:17.20 --> 01:43:19.92
where you're up flying and all you see is,

1941
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:21.40
all you, all I see when I'm flying

1942
01:43:21.40 --> 01:43:23.64
to helicopter is threats.

1943
01:43:23.64 --> 01:43:26.000
And you can't even come close to cover them all.

1944
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.80
At least on the ground, I can cover some of the threats.

1945
01:43:28.80 --> 01:43:30.16
When you're in an aircraft, it's like,

1946
01:43:30.16 --> 01:43:32.44
I'm a weight and you get shot to them.

1947
01:43:32.44 --> 01:43:33.72
That's what it feels like to me.

1948
01:43:35.88 --> 01:43:38.56
When you remember coming to or when you remember

1949
01:43:38.56 --> 01:43:39.92
what they do with you once you got in the hospital,

1950
01:43:39.92 --> 01:43:42.24
do you remember much of that?

1951
01:43:42.24 --> 01:43:47.000
No, I remember the helicopter landing

1952
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000
because my head bounced on the middle.

1953
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.96
I thought, damn, could I put someone on my head?

1954
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:54.20
And I remember, then pick them up and put them

1955
01:43:54.20 --> 01:43:56.32
on a stretcher because they grab my belt

1956
01:43:56.32 --> 01:43:58.24
and pick them up in the middle.

1957
01:43:58.24 --> 01:44:02.000
And it felt like a drug just going right through me.

1958
01:44:03.84 --> 01:44:07.52
I've faintly remember the sound of,

1959
01:44:07.52 --> 01:44:09.20
hearing this guy that sounded like there was another side

1960
01:44:09.20 --> 01:44:10.24
of a football field saying,

1961
01:44:10.24 --> 01:44:14.28
negative vitals, negative vitals, negative vitals.

1962
01:44:14.28 --> 01:44:17.44
And then the next thing I felt this crush on my chest,

1963
01:44:17.44 --> 01:44:18.88
and I thought, that's okay.

1964
01:44:18.88 --> 01:44:22.92
Because they're getting the heart back up.

1965
01:44:22.92 --> 01:44:25.60
Checkin' you know, oh, so they were like doing CPR.

1966
01:44:25.60 --> 01:44:28.44
Yeah, well, I was probably resuscitated three times

1967
01:44:28.44 --> 01:44:31.80
just after the helicopter landed at the NSA

1968
01:44:31.80 --> 01:44:35.16
denying the hospital, but my corpsman had been straddling

1969
01:44:35.16 --> 01:44:37.04
at a whole time when the helicopter was pushing

1970
01:44:37.04 --> 01:44:39.40
on the heart to keep blood flowing.

1971
01:44:41.56 --> 01:44:46.20
And it was, I said, I'm not my best day, but you know,

1972
01:44:46.20 --> 01:44:48.36
hey, I want him here talking about it, so.

1973
01:44:48.36 --> 01:44:50.32
And I'll take it that way, tell him.

1974
01:44:50.32 --> 01:44:52.44
You do, you do different, believe me.

1975
01:44:52.44 --> 01:44:54.76
Because there's no reason I should be.

1976
01:44:54.76 --> 01:44:56.64
When I left Bethesda after a year,

1977
01:44:56.64 --> 01:44:59.68
my attending physician was the chief of neurosurgery.

1978
01:44:59.68 --> 01:45:01.64
He called me in his office and said, hey, I can't know.

1979
01:45:01.64 --> 01:45:05.80
I said, I wish that medicine could take credit for this,

1980
01:45:05.80 --> 01:45:07.56
but no, he said, we can't.

1981
01:45:07.56 --> 01:45:09.48
He says, I don't know what, it's what everyone

1982
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:13.68
called, you know, karma, luck, God, whatever you want to call.

1983
01:45:13.68 --> 01:45:16.76
I wish it was medicine, but it wasn't.

1984
01:45:16.76 --> 01:45:21.000
I figured he was a pretty leading expert on head injuries.

1985
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.76
How long did it, so you get to the hospital and you're there?

1986
01:45:25.76 --> 01:45:28.24
At some point, they must have gotten stabilized.

1987
01:45:30.76 --> 01:45:33.72
They must have, yeah, as I understood at the chief

1988
01:45:33.72 --> 01:45:36.40
neurosurgeon from the hospital, she'd just happened to be there

1989
01:45:36.40 --> 01:45:39.20
that day, like, given an insert, which was not like that.

1990
01:45:39.20 --> 01:45:43.20
And boom, they were on me, like flies on steak.

1991
01:45:43.20 --> 01:45:47.20
I just remember waking up, being extremely cold

1992
01:45:47.20 --> 01:45:52.20
and hearing a baby cry and cry and cry.

1993
01:45:52.20 --> 01:45:54.20
And I said, this can't be right.

1994
01:45:54.20 --> 01:45:58.20
Maybe I'm not here, you know?

1995
01:45:58.20 --> 01:46:01.20
But sure enough, it turned out there was a

1996
01:46:01.20 --> 01:46:03.20
a quorum, a till me later, a couple days later,

1997
01:46:03.20 --> 01:46:06.20
that there was a baby that had been burned, you know,

1998
01:46:06.20 --> 01:46:09.20
due to US force action, who was, you know,

1999
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:12.20
this was like a ward that was a intensive care ward.

2000
01:46:12.20 --> 01:46:15.20
And apparently, and there wasn't a baby

2001
01:46:15.20 --> 01:46:17.20
anymore, a couple of mama signs in the baby did cry,

2002
01:46:17.20 --> 01:46:19.20
almost all the time.

2003
01:46:19.20 --> 01:46:23.20
That's what I remember, my troops came to say goodbye.

2004
01:46:23.20 --> 01:46:27.20
Twenty-two of me, led a minute in groups of two.

2005
01:46:27.20 --> 01:46:32.20
All I could do was cry.

2006
01:46:32.20 --> 01:46:34.20
I just, I didn't have words for them.

2007
01:46:34.20 --> 01:46:37.20
Other than say, things like keep your head down and stuff like that.

2008
01:46:37.20 --> 01:46:39.20
Because I knew by then that I had a head injury.

2009
01:46:39.20 --> 01:46:42.20
And I knew it just slowly dawned on them.

2010
01:46:42.20 --> 01:46:44.20
I mean, no one told me, you know, that this left side

2011
01:46:44.20 --> 01:46:47.20
was paralyzed along with my right leg.

2012
01:46:47.20 --> 01:46:49.20
No one told me that it just came to me over time

2013
01:46:49.20 --> 01:46:50.20
when I would try to do something.

2014
01:46:50.20 --> 01:46:52.20
The only way I could get attention,

2015
01:46:52.20 --> 01:46:54.20
so I had this perfect left paralysis down

2016
01:46:54.20 --> 01:46:57.20
side of my face for a talk like that.

2017
01:46:57.20 --> 01:46:58.20
I'd raise my hand.

2018
01:46:58.20 --> 01:47:01.20
They tied it down, the bedrails because that's,

2019
01:47:01.20 --> 01:47:04.20
well, all the IVs were in the right arm.

2020
01:47:04.20 --> 01:47:06.20
Well, I was helpless.

2021
01:47:06.20 --> 01:47:09.20
I was, I've never been so miserable.

2022
01:47:09.20 --> 01:47:11.20
Is that moment when they tied that arm down?

2023
01:47:11.20 --> 01:47:14.20
And it's just the trauma to your brain that it caused you

2024
01:47:14.20 --> 01:47:18.20
to be paralyzed in your left arm and, and was your left side of your body?

2025
01:47:18.20 --> 01:47:19.20
Left side of my body in the right leg.

2026
01:47:19.20 --> 01:47:24.20
It was the, the bullet head blown away about three by seven

2027
01:47:24.20 --> 01:47:26.20
centimeter defect in my skull.

2028
01:47:26.20 --> 01:47:29.20
I had, had, had penetrated the meninges.

2029
01:47:29.20 --> 01:47:33.20
Naked the parital robe and the frontal lobes.

2030
01:47:33.20 --> 01:47:36.20
And I tore this pure sagittal sign up, so that's,

2031
01:47:36.20 --> 01:47:39.20
that's, that's one of this incompatible with life as we know it.

2032
01:47:39.20 --> 01:47:42.20
But the, here I am, telling you about it, so.

2033
01:47:42.20 --> 01:47:47.20
You know, one of your, one of your guys, once again,

2034
01:47:47.20 --> 01:47:50.20
your, your kids in an awesome job getting gathering some information.

2035
01:47:50.20 --> 01:47:55.20
One of your guys, Robert Wood, daily, beard.

2036
01:47:55.20 --> 01:47:58.20
The third, you know, you're a third too.

2037
01:47:58.20 --> 01:47:59.20
I'm second.

2038
01:47:59.20 --> 01:48:00.20
Okay.

2039
01:48:00.20 --> 01:48:03.40
I, I thought it, if somebody's, he says he thought that he'd be

2040
01:48:03.40 --> 01:48:06.20
rethed, but yeah, so he's the third.

2041
01:48:06.20 --> 01:48:08.20
He was a Lance Corporal in first,

2042
01:48:08.20 --> 01:48:10.20
putoon, Delta Company.

2043
01:48:10.20 --> 01:48:12.20
First Recombatalion.

2044
01:48:12.20 --> 01:48:15.20
And he, he talks about, and he, he, he starts off kind of telling

2045
01:48:15.20 --> 01:48:19.20
what it was like for him to meet you and how impressed he was with you as a leader.

2046
01:48:19.20 --> 01:48:23.20
And, and actually felt what you talked better than it was like, you know, that he could tell that you,

2047
01:48:23.20 --> 01:48:25.20
you, you cared about the troops.

2048
01:48:25.20 --> 01:48:28.20
And then it gets to this point where he's.

2049
01:48:28.20 --> 01:48:32.20
Coming, they're coming to that, they're journeyed to say goodbye to you.

2050
01:48:32.20 --> 01:48:36.20
And so here's what Robert Wood, daily, beard.

2051
01:48:36.20 --> 01:48:38.20
The third says he says then that afternoon,

2052
01:48:38.20 --> 01:48:43.20
the team made a solemn journey to the Naval Hospital to see the lieutenant.

2053
01:48:43.20 --> 01:48:48.20
Everyone watched the scenery without really seeing it as we rode along in a six by truck.

2054
01:48:48.20 --> 01:48:50.20
We were too worried about him.

2055
01:48:50.20 --> 01:48:55.20
We arrived and went to neuroward Bravo to.

2056
01:48:55.20 --> 01:49:00.20
We could only see him two at a time and since I was new, I was last, I waited.

2057
01:49:00.20 --> 01:49:04.20
When my teammates came out, they looked pale.

2058
01:49:04.20 --> 01:49:05.20
Then it was my turn.

2059
01:49:05.20 --> 01:49:06.20
I was nervous.

2060
01:49:06.20 --> 01:49:08.20
I entered the World Ward.

2061
01:49:08.20 --> 01:49:13.20
It was lengthy with empty racks here at the near end.

2062
01:49:13.20 --> 01:49:17.20
Each rack was covered with a crisp white sheet ready for its next visitor.

2063
01:49:17.20 --> 01:49:23.20
On a long shelf on the right, there were plastic models of planes, ships, and cars that the patients had made.

2064
01:49:23.20 --> 01:49:25.20
I walked onward.

2065
01:49:25.20 --> 01:49:28.20
One of the health your men was putting together a model plane.

2066
01:49:28.20 --> 01:49:31.20
On the left was an ancient poposon with white hair.

2067
01:49:31.20 --> 01:49:39.20
His beard, a dirty gray contrasted with his hospital tunic, a nurse with an angelic voice attracted my attention.

2068
01:49:39.20 --> 01:49:44.20
I noticed her face, firm with conviction and wondered how she could work in such a tragic place.

2069
01:49:44.20 --> 01:49:48.20
She was feeding a baby, seeing that struck me deeply.

2070
01:49:48.20 --> 01:49:51.20
The baby was burned over 70% of its body.

2071
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:54.20
I pressed onward, but paused.

2072
01:49:54.20 --> 01:49:56.20
Wondering what I should say.

2073
01:49:56.20 --> 01:49:59.20
Patients filled the beds at this end of the ward.

2074
01:49:59.20 --> 01:50:04.20
Unhealed wounds, burns, scars, and vacant stairs, stabbed out at me.

2075
01:50:04.20 --> 01:50:06.20
Half of the face there.

2076
01:50:06.20 --> 01:50:09.20
No eyes and no arm legs here.

2077
01:50:09.20 --> 01:50:12.20
Body's covered with gauze, seemingly mummified.

2078
01:50:12.20 --> 01:50:17.20
The morbid display may be realized how truly bad war is, but the worst was yet to come.

2079
01:50:17.20 --> 01:50:21.20
I passed Harry Mundorf and Rudy Seville.

2080
01:50:21.20 --> 01:50:26.20
They were coming out somehow they didn't look the same as when I'd seen the Meshore time ago.

2081
01:50:26.20 --> 01:50:30.20
There he was in the last raft on the left.

2082
01:50:30.20 --> 01:50:34.20
He lay on his right side and glanced up with glazed eyes when I approached.

2083
01:50:34.20 --> 01:50:37.20
A turban of bandaged, bandaged his cover to his head.

2084
01:50:37.20 --> 01:50:44.20
His pale face showed no emotion, except sadness, and his eyes were red from crying.

2085
01:50:44.20 --> 01:50:53.20
All the time we talked, he stared at the airborne parachute wings on my chest as if they were something he wanted very badly.

2086
01:50:53.20 --> 01:50:59.20
He had told me when I'd first joined the platoon that he hadn't gone to jump school yet.

2087
01:50:59.20 --> 01:51:01.20
And that he was looking forward to it.

2088
01:51:01.20 --> 01:51:04.20
He started by saying, hello, beard, how you doing?

2089
01:51:04.20 --> 01:51:06.20
I said, good afternoon sir, I'm fine.

2090
01:51:06.20 --> 01:51:10.20
His voice was weak like a child who was afraid of times I could barely hear him.

2091
01:51:10.20 --> 01:51:20.20
He added again to the conversation by thanking all of us and I replied that it had been the least we could do.

2092
01:51:20.20 --> 01:51:23.20
Then I asked him if he'd be back at recon in three months or so.

2093
01:51:23.20 --> 01:51:27.20
A tear came to his eye and he said he would never be coming back.

2094
01:51:27.20 --> 01:51:29.20
You see, he said my legs are paralyzed.

2095
01:51:29.20 --> 01:51:34.20
I choked up in my skin, crawled and I was unable to speak.

2096
01:51:34.20 --> 01:51:39.20
A silence cold and heavy, a silence cold and heavy prevailed.

2097
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:44.20
Finally, he broke the silence saying, beard, you're a big man and there's something I want you to do.

2098
01:51:44.20 --> 01:51:48.20
Keep your head down there, keep your head down when you're out of the bush.

2099
01:51:48.20 --> 01:51:56.20
This statement hit me and grabbed my heart and I screamed inside myself deep, deep down somewhere that I never knew existed.

2100
01:51:56.20 --> 01:52:03.20
I promised him that I would would and bid him my fondest farewell, turned and walked away.

2101
01:52:03.20 --> 01:52:07.20
I wanted to run from him, from them, from the whole world.

2102
01:52:07.20 --> 01:52:12.20
I wanted to run past those helpless men in those metal beds out to the street and far far away,

2103
01:52:12.20 --> 01:52:16.20
but I kept my control and walked at a brisk pace.

2104
01:52:16.20 --> 01:52:22.20
The echoes of that screen resounded inside me again and again, threatening to tear me apart.

2105
01:52:22.20 --> 01:52:27.20
Suddenly, the anguish melted away as I stepped out into the brutal, tropic sun.

2106
01:52:27.20 --> 01:52:34.20
But the feeling that I had still ran like hot lava through my veins.

2107
01:52:34.20 --> 01:52:39.20
The ride back home was the same. No one looked at the scenery or any other nor talked with anyone.

2108
01:52:39.20 --> 01:52:46.20
Each was involved with their own memories of second lieutenant Charles Robert, Eisenbach II.

2109
01:52:46.20 --> 01:52:50.20
He was a man with such brilliant mind and exuberance to be alive.

2110
01:52:50.20 --> 01:52:55.20
Now he lay in a hospital, suffering a far worse fate to him than death.

2111
01:52:55.20 --> 01:53:00.20
His once healthy body was now frail and flimsy, like a person who had always been an invalid.

2112
01:53:00.20 --> 01:53:07.20
Left only was his mind and he had too much time to think and reflect upon what had happened and what was going to happen.

2113
01:53:07.20 --> 01:53:12.20
It was a great strain and shock to see him with hope.

2114
01:53:12.20 --> 01:53:18.20
He will work his way back because he does have guts.

2115
01:53:18.20 --> 01:53:24.20
And what's interesting about that, that's a heavy rendering of what happened.

2116
01:53:24.20 --> 01:53:28.20
But that's actually from his personal journal that he kept while he was in Vietnam.

2117
01:53:28.20 --> 01:53:34.20
So the thoughts of whatever probably a 20 year old kid seeing this unfold.

2118
01:53:34.20 --> 01:53:38.20
Well, I need to say, Alaska will be aired. I think he had a year of college.

2119
01:53:38.20 --> 01:53:44.20
He was kind of a platoon spokesman. He became a writer and a poet.

2120
01:53:44.20 --> 01:53:52.20
So he obviously had a great command of the English language and maybe saw some things or invented some things that weren't necessarily there.

2121
01:53:52.20 --> 01:53:55.20
But that was his reality.

2122
01:53:55.20 --> 01:54:01.20
I can't argue with it. Nothing he said in the air. I don't think was untrue.

2123
01:54:01.20 --> 01:54:05.20
I was what we call a herton gator.

2124
01:54:05.20 --> 01:54:15.20
In fact, I remember they told me that I was going to an army hospital in Japan.

2125
01:54:15.20 --> 01:54:21.20
Well, the only thing I knew was that Marines when they got wounded and Vietnam, they went to a naval hospital in Yokohama.

2126
01:54:21.20 --> 01:54:27.20
So I just pissed a little busy fit. Why are you setting me to an army hospital?

2127
01:54:27.20 --> 01:54:35.20
Not knowing that this army hospital in Camp Drake outside of Techakawa Air Force Base in Japan was where all head injuries went.

2128
01:54:35.20 --> 01:54:39.20
That was their specialty was head injuries.

2129
01:54:39.20 --> 01:54:45.20
So they probably got a dock in there to calm me down and tell me how this was the place I needed to be.

2130
01:54:45.20 --> 01:54:53.20
And one hospital was just as good as another, which of course you don't believe when it's not your services hospital.

2131
01:54:53.20 --> 01:55:01.20
But hey, I was 23-year-old kiddo and I had been a naval hospital before and I always got in great care.

2132
01:55:01.20 --> 01:55:03.20
And that's what I was expecting.

2133
01:55:03.20 --> 01:55:09.20
And it turned out this general support hospital that I ended up at was first rate.

2134
01:55:09.20 --> 01:55:17.20
I was there for like 10 days before I was a stable enough to make the planter at back home and interesting place.

2135
01:55:17.20 --> 01:55:19.20
So for 10 days you're there.

2136
01:55:19.20 --> 01:55:23.20
Are they doing surgery or are they just trying to let you heal up?

2137
01:55:23.20 --> 01:55:29.20
They're just kind of letting me heal up and they've started physical therapy on my head.

2138
01:55:29.20 --> 01:55:38.20
Tremendous spasms in both my legs and my left arm so they had physical therapy makes some braces that they put on my feet.

2139
01:55:38.20 --> 01:55:41.20
And they made a hand brace for my thumb sticking out like this.

2140
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:45.20
And on my arm it's spasms that's coming to beat me into the eye.

2141
01:55:45.20 --> 01:55:47.20
I have to hold this arm down.

2142
01:55:47.20 --> 01:55:49.20
I was miserable.

2143
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:55.20
There was just a young kid to my right who lost an eye was an Air Force Airman.

2144
01:55:55.20 --> 01:55:59.20
And it lost an eye and an eye and that was this that was this problem.

2145
01:55:59.20 --> 01:56:00.20
That was this major problem.

2146
01:56:00.20 --> 01:56:03.20
And he had been tasked to be my feeder and my smoker.

2147
01:56:03.20 --> 01:56:11.20
I was a smoker then and I would just crave a camel and he'd have to be around to handle it because I couldn't deal with it.

2148
01:56:11.20 --> 01:56:17.20
But terrific kid and they really took excellent care of me in this hospital.

2149
01:56:17.20 --> 01:56:19.20
Just like everybody else.

2150
01:56:19.20 --> 01:56:24.20
So the spasms in your arms and legs which we are all admittedly

2151
01:56:24.20 --> 01:56:27.20
all of us just laughed when you told that story.

2152
01:56:27.20 --> 01:56:36.20
It's pretty disturbing but that had to be a little bit of a good sign because some kind of spasms means that there's some nerve signal getting there.

2153
01:56:36.20 --> 01:56:37.20
Well exactly.

2154
01:56:37.20 --> 01:56:40.20
And what it was was a screwed up signal.

2155
01:56:40.20 --> 01:56:43.20
It wasn't telling the thing to do anything useful.

2156
01:56:43.20 --> 01:56:46.20
It was just telling these muscles to fire.

2157
01:56:46.20 --> 01:56:51.20
Again from the damage to area in my brain as I understand it.

2158
01:56:51.20 --> 01:56:55.20
And looking back on it.

2159
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:57.20
But that was your mindset that you're going now from hey.

2160
01:56:57.20 --> 01:57:00.20
I mean when you said you were paralyzed when you initially got hit.

2161
01:57:00.20 --> 01:57:02.20
And now you can't move your leg.

2162
01:57:02.20 --> 01:57:03.20
You can't move your leg.

2163
01:57:03.20 --> 01:57:04.20
You can't move your leg.

2164
01:57:04.20 --> 01:57:06.20
You're going to move your legs or your left arm.

2165
01:57:06.20 --> 01:57:08.20
But and would you in your mind?

2166
01:57:08.20 --> 01:57:10.20
Did you think okay I might be this might be it.

2167
01:57:10.20 --> 01:57:12.20
You know I might be paralyzed like this forever.

2168
01:57:12.20 --> 01:57:15.20
Well of course you don't know what the future holds.

2169
01:57:15.20 --> 01:57:20.20
I mean none of us do but the better you become more aware you become of your limit.

2170
01:57:20.20 --> 01:57:25.20
And yeah you start to think how long is this going to last?

2171
01:57:25.20 --> 01:57:26.20
Is this forever?

2172
01:57:26.20 --> 01:57:29.20
What am I going to do for the rest of my life?

2173
01:57:29.20 --> 01:57:35.20
You know you're not going to be a Marine because you have a job description.

2174
01:57:35.20 --> 01:57:38.20
Marines through you know in wheelchairs.

2175
01:57:38.20 --> 01:57:43.20
But the one saving grace I always thought was well I'm single.

2176
01:57:43.20 --> 01:57:48.20
At least there's not you know a wife involved in a child on the way.

2177
01:57:48.20 --> 01:57:51.20
Like most of my contemporaries had.

2178
01:57:51.20 --> 01:58:00.20
But conversely the guys who were you know as I found out later on it but this the guys who were married felt it was much better to be married because you had this.

2179
01:58:00.20 --> 01:58:03.20
You know direct support system which you were coming back into.

2180
01:58:03.20 --> 01:58:06.20
You know you know this woman was going to be there.

2181
01:58:06.20 --> 01:58:08.20
They weren't of course always.

2182
01:58:08.20 --> 01:58:13.20
You know things don't last a lot of times when you get big changes like that in your life unfortunately.

2183
01:58:13.20 --> 01:58:17.20
But the guys who are married that are much better be married and those of us who are single those much better be

2184
01:58:17.20 --> 01:58:18.20
single.

2185
01:58:18.20 --> 01:58:29.20
But sure you say you know that's the first question out of your mind is when you get to your final destination was for me with the thessanable hospital.

2186
01:58:29.20 --> 01:58:31.20
So how long am I going to be here?

2187
01:58:31.20 --> 01:58:33.20
Well they don't have any idea.

2188
01:58:33.20 --> 01:58:36.20
They don't know how your cover is going to unwind.

2189
01:58:36.20 --> 01:58:43.20
So finally my doctor said to me hey you could be here for two years and I can't guarantee that you'll walk out even then.

2190
01:58:43.20 --> 01:58:47.20
I thought to myself well damn he didn't know who he's dealing with my plan.

2191
01:58:47.20 --> 01:58:51.20
I got shot on the fourth until my plan was to be back and we got none by Christmas with my guys.

2192
01:58:51.20 --> 01:58:53.20
You know that didn't work out but that was my plan.

2193
01:58:53.20 --> 01:58:55.20
And I worked hard to make it happen.

2194
01:58:55.20 --> 01:58:56.20
It didn't happen.

2195
01:58:56.20 --> 01:59:02.20
You know a year later I walked out of there under my own power with a leg brace and a cane and got on to ambulance

2196
01:59:02.20 --> 01:59:08.20
and was driven down the road in 1995 to the VA hospital and Richmond Virginia where I was stayed for another four months.

2197
01:59:08.20 --> 01:59:10.20
But you don't know what's going to happen.

2198
01:59:10.20 --> 01:59:18.20
You're just it's a slowly evolving kind of mental process you go through.

2199
01:59:18.20 --> 01:59:23.20
You hit a point I did and I know the guy is dead too because we talked about this.

2200
01:59:23.20 --> 01:59:29.20
Well you'd say why me you know why my my my my my my my god why does that happen to me.

2201
01:59:29.20 --> 01:59:34.20
And I don't know if other guys got there got an answer to that question but I did.

2202
01:59:34.20 --> 01:59:42.20
I over time this answer evolved you know and answer was why not you I some buck.

2203
01:59:42.20 --> 01:59:43.20
Who are you?

2204
01:59:43.20 --> 01:59:49.20
You're no better than anybody else I put down that little blue planet but you're no worse either.

2205
01:59:49.20 --> 01:59:57.20
So you're just going to have to go with the punches and that's the answer why not you you're no better in a worse than anybody else.

2206
01:59:57.20 --> 02:00:01.20
I mean that's a little hard for I think for some people to stomach but that was the answer I got.

2207
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:11.20
And you know it's it's served as purpose okay why not me this is it this is the way it is I guess I'm what I just have to take it a day at a time.

2208
02:00:11.20 --> 02:00:17.20
And do my best to get better and see where I end up and and when I get to that point.

2209
02:00:17.20 --> 02:00:24.20
You know I'll make decisions about what I'm going to do for the future which I you know I did and I had a lot of vocational counseling from the VA.

2210
02:00:24.20 --> 02:00:29.20
When I get flushed you know out of the service and out of the VA system.

2211
02:00:29.20 --> 02:00:38.20
I got a lot of vocational like I said vocational counseling I got interest tests that I take you know because the question now is okay what am I going to do for the rest of my life.

2212
02:00:38.20 --> 02:00:42.20
Well not surprisingly I scored highest on military officer.

2213
02:00:42.20 --> 02:00:43.20
Oh right.

2214
02:00:43.20 --> 02:00:49.20
Gee I just was one of those a couple of months ago second highest was FBI agent.

2215
02:00:49.20 --> 02:01:00.20
Oh that sounds good but again they don't have job descriptions for guys who limp you know and finally I scored third on teacher.

2216
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:06.20
I said well I see interesting and that evolved in the thing about becoming a therapist.

2217
02:01:06.20 --> 02:01:18.20
And specifically a speech therapist I had a speech defect that I just kind of overcame myself at Bethesda by slowing down and trying to think about what I was going to say before I said it.

2218
02:01:18.20 --> 02:01:33.20
I got the nickname Spock because my speech became very deliberate but when I was just spontaneous apparently and I never heard this but my roommate would say I said I said what?

2219
02:01:33.20 --> 02:01:36.20
He said what was with that language that's a what language.

2220
02:01:36.20 --> 02:01:42.20
And I would maybe had some visitors couple of gals from people I know or overseas and got up.

2221
02:01:42.20 --> 02:01:58.20
He said it was filthy and I said really I never heard it and he said yes I started to slow down myself and try to think about what I would say but speech therapist kind of stuck in my mind after this vocational counseling that I got.

2222
02:01:58.20 --> 02:02:01.20
That's eventually what I became was a speech language pathologist.

2223
02:02:01.20 --> 02:02:05.20
So he said your speech was filthy meaning that you were like swearing.

2224
02:02:05.20 --> 02:02:06.20
Oh yeah.

2225
02:02:06.20 --> 02:02:12.20
Just using every filthy word like what's a Tourette syndrome is that what it's called?

2226
02:02:12.20 --> 02:02:14.20
Yeah, what Tourette syndrome?

2227
02:02:14.20 --> 02:02:18.20
I had no idea that I was doing that I didn't hear it.

2228
02:02:18.20 --> 02:02:24.20
Because what you just did it naturally like that how you talked kind of thing or like why didn't you remember it?

2229
02:02:24.20 --> 02:02:36.20
I know it wasn't how I normally would speak it was just it would just come out and totally inappropriate situations and it not monks the guys but you know monks visitors.

2230
02:02:36.20 --> 02:02:39.20
Like I said I didn't know what's going on.

2231
02:02:39.20 --> 02:02:49.20
But you uh you kind of glanced over the fact that that you know you got the feedback hey you can't you can't stay in the Marine Corps anymore and you.

2232
02:02:49.20 --> 02:02:55.20
It sounds like you you figured that out yourself but at some point that's that's got to turn into a harsh reality.

2233
02:02:55.20 --> 02:02:57.20
But that's what you wanted to do.

2234
02:02:57.20 --> 02:03:02.20
You're in Vietnam, you're in a cartoon command you got the best guys in the world and all of a sudden in one day it's gone.

2235
02:03:02.20 --> 02:03:10.20
It's right it's gone and you don't know what's going to replace it but yeah eventually you get before a physical evaluation board.

2236
02:03:10.20 --> 02:03:19.20
And what I had hoped for because most of my roommates and most of the guys there I knew that had Marines they had orthopedic injuries.

2237
02:03:19.20 --> 02:03:26.20
You know they got stitched up with the machine gun and their legs or whatever they got put on the temporary disabled retired list.

2238
02:03:26.20 --> 02:03:37.20
That allowed you five years to regain your ability and if you could you would get the chance to go back into the Marine Corps.

2239
02:03:37.20 --> 02:03:47.20
Well on the other hand if you got better the VA could drop your disability rating down so it was kind of a double edge sword most guys just wanted to get out.

2240
02:03:47.20 --> 02:03:53.20
But for guys like me that they call a life risk if I wanted I wanted to career it.

2241
02:03:53.20 --> 02:03:59.20
And I argued that I could fly any desk well that that was fine but that wasn't that wasn't going to fly.

2242
02:03:59.20 --> 02:04:15.20
I was going to be retired but as long as I was on the TDRL temporary disabled retired list I thought well I got a chance but I get a I met the VA hospital now I've been through my physical evaluation board they've asked me questions and I've got a transcript of it.

2243
02:04:15.20 --> 02:04:20.20
My doctor submitted statements and stuff like that and they said well we'll get you on the TDRL.

2244
02:04:20.20 --> 02:04:30.20
And I said great because I'd have five years to work myself back in the Corps came through my orders for retirement hours came through one day and when I was in the VA hospital.

2245
02:04:30.20 --> 02:04:34.20
Permanent disabled retired list no chance that they were getting back.

2246
02:04:34.20 --> 02:04:54.20
But I was just talking about I was on the phone to the secretary and navy's office which I got through to and some nice older woman right there who obviously had heard this story before you know I was promised the TDRL but I've heard I've been permanently retired.

2247
02:04:54.20 --> 02:05:11.20
Lieutenant you've got to understand that you know we've done this a few times before and we kind of know the the history of these kinds of injuries and your board did recommend the permanent retired disabled this not the temporary.

2248
02:05:11.20 --> 02:05:23.20
So you know we have to go to the they say in of course they were right but again you know I was you know by now I'm old men at 24 right and I'm being retired excuse me I didn't that's not the plan.

2249
02:05:23.20 --> 02:05:34.20
But that's that's how it all worked how long did it take you to realize how long to take you to accept that so you you kind of got through the the why me why not right.

2250
02:05:34.20 --> 02:05:45.20
How did you how long to take you to get through this fact that okay now the Marine Corps your your sacred Marine Corps has has made this decision.

2251
02:05:45.20 --> 02:05:50.20
You know I'm still thinking about.

2252
02:05:50.20 --> 02:05:59.20
So 50 on years that's right I'm still now I got a new why me question here but now I I adjusted.

2253
02:05:59.20 --> 02:06:06.20
I went out of graduate school got a master's degree in the speech department the University of Florida and.

2254
02:06:06.20 --> 02:06:15.20
They weren't quite sure what had walked through the door when I went when I arrived I wanted to know where the coffee mess was.

2255
02:06:15.20 --> 02:06:22.20
And they're all looking like the what. Oh, you know place where you get just dropping morning get a cup of coffee pay a dime or whatever.

2256
02:06:22.20 --> 02:06:30.20
Well, we don't have anything like that. Well we're going to get one to do now we do now that's right and most of my classes were on the third floor of this building.

2257
02:06:30.20 --> 02:06:35.20
Which had an elevator went up to third floor but it didn't work had worked in years.

2258
02:06:35.20 --> 02:06:47.20
And so I went to my advisor I said look this tree flights of stairs is killed me three times a day you know we got to get that elevator work as well can't do it like no way hasn't worked since I've been here the prof set.

2259
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:53.20
Well we'll see about that. He said well what are you going to do I said well I'm going to talk to the president.

2260
02:06:53.20 --> 02:06:56.20
The president what president president of the university.

2261
02:06:56.20 --> 02:07:09.20
So you can't do that really watch me so I did he wasn't there but his it's like chief of staff was who happened to be a guy who had kind of an arm injury from World War II.

2262
02:07:09.20 --> 02:07:15.20
And he said oh can't be repaired can it. So lots of the telling me sir.

2263
02:07:15.20 --> 02:07:20.20
I'll take care. Well next day it was working just fine and work for the next three years.

2264
02:07:20.20 --> 02:07:31.20
I'm sure my master broke. Didn't have a down day. How we kind of we kind of jumped over this part how long were you in Bethesda for total I wasn't Bethesda for over 12 months.

2265
02:07:31.20 --> 02:07:38.20
And and throughout that time you know when you showed up when you got wounded you couldn't move your legs or arm.

2266
02:07:38.20 --> 02:07:44.20
What was the progression like getting you back to to you know the best.

2267
02:07:44.20 --> 02:07:52.20
Yeah well it was a physical therapy occupational therapy you know once they which I decided once it was good twice might be better.

2268
02:07:52.20 --> 02:07:55.20
So I argued for that and pretty soon I got that.

2269
02:07:55.20 --> 02:08:01.20
By November my right leg had started to get remarkably better.

2270
02:08:01.20 --> 02:08:10.20
My left leg still wasn't real useful but that you put a brace on it and I could bite November I was walking.

2271
02:08:10.20 --> 02:08:20.20
I had a crutch on one side on the right side a law-francrutch you know the metal things called polio crutches back then but I don't know what they're.

2272
02:08:20.20 --> 02:08:28.20
I think my call them law-francrutches because that's a guy invented and a carman on my left side but I was walking you know and of course I went back to.

2273
02:08:28.20 --> 02:08:39.20
I found a drop to a carman and and went to two law-francrutches drop the right the left one after a while back to the right one then drop that to a cane and the leg brace on my left.

2274
02:08:39.20 --> 02:08:52.20
And then I did fine for about 42 years that way about eight years ago my right leg decided to take an early retirement on me and so I had to start wearing a brace on that leg and.

2275
02:08:52.20 --> 02:08:58.20
And I was falling too much so they put me into a to an electric wheelchair which is what I.

2276
02:08:58.20 --> 02:09:01.20
Scooter around the house and around town and.

2277
02:09:01.20 --> 02:09:12.20
The scooter over there is what it flies my my wheelchair and flies 247 pounds and it doesn't fly that flies that breaks down in four or five parts of my life.

2278
02:09:12.20 --> 02:09:17.20
Can do it usually by our own course this weekend we've had the kids to help her just throw it back.

2279
02:09:17.20 --> 02:09:30.20
I know some of the real so speaking you fall down some of the notes had you wear in our football helmet while you were down there it sounded like that made a quite an impact on some of the places that you'd visit with your football home and.

2280
02:09:30.20 --> 02:09:36.20
Well, you know I was falling when I started that you know walking to penalty at the hospital.

2281
02:09:36.20 --> 02:09:37.20
You don't have a left foot drop.

2282
02:09:37.20 --> 02:09:45.20
It means the brace was supposed to bring it up so it clears all the little obstacles and they're you don't have pay attention to when you got too good feet.

2283
02:09:45.20 --> 02:09:50.20
But I would fall into elevators because they wouldn't exactly align and I'd fall into everybody in there.

2284
02:09:50.20 --> 02:09:54.20
So eventually I started to they get they say you need a football helmet.

2285
02:09:54.20 --> 02:10:04.20
You got the right right I have got I've got a defect up there you can put your hand in my defect and take it take my my pulse just like this for a squeeze hard the thing would pop up.

2286
02:10:04.20 --> 02:10:07.20
But when you get a titanium plate in there.

2287
02:10:07.20 --> 02:10:13.60
Oh that was after about a year at the end of the my year they waited a year before they put a plate in your skull because it was considered a

2288
02:10:13.60 --> 02:10:23.60
a contaminated room not sure what that meant to the medical people but it meant to me it meant you waited a year and put the plate in.

2289
02:10:23.60 --> 02:10:33.60
But so this football film my dad got it from the University of Delaware he worked and it was blue with the commission thing with you know y'all stripes.

2290
02:10:33.60 --> 02:10:38.60
So in the occupational therapy I got a can of all of graph pain with my they'd make it.

2291
02:10:38.60 --> 02:10:51.60
You do everything with my left hand I spray painted this thing. I'll grab my roommate at the time he had been there long and I had apparently I was the perfect roommate for him because.

2292
02:10:51.60 --> 02:11:01.60
I had lost my sense of smell and taste and apparently he'd been in a body spike a cast from here you know down it was knees for like six months and he's stuck to high heaven.

2293
02:11:01.60 --> 02:11:11.60
So I didn't smell so I was apparently the per his sister got this button book where he had a blank button and a bunch of things you could put on the button.

2294
02:11:11.60 --> 02:11:21.60
And but it also had some you know bullet holes with the shattered glass type things so I put those on the front of the front of the football.

2295
02:11:21.60 --> 02:11:31.60
And I had a little badge. Oh, you know maybe three inches around said my head is a pressed area.

2296
02:11:31.60 --> 02:11:37.60
And I'd wear that on my my bathroom around the hospital. I'd know people would just stop and look at me and I agreed that.

2297
02:11:37.60 --> 02:11:41.60
Look at me and they just they can't move out of the way.

2298
02:11:41.60 --> 02:11:46.60
And you want to mess with this guy he might have been crazy dark dark humor's popular family.

2299
02:11:46.60 --> 02:11:56.60
Well dark humor you know Bethesda that time there was probably all always about a dozen of us young look and it's you know between the eighth floor and the fourth floor of the.

2300
02:11:56.60 --> 02:11:59.60
Well they call it Roosevelt's erection the tower.

2301
02:11:59.60 --> 02:12:09.60
And Bethesda anyway and we had a we didn't know it at the time but we had a great group dynamic going on there was always someone who was worse off than you.

2302
02:12:09.60 --> 02:12:14.60
So when you started to feel sorry for yourself or started to get down your buddies would come in as hey.

2303
02:12:14.60 --> 02:12:24.60
What about you know what about ice my cover there what about but to chill over here or so and so smitty and and sure enough there was always somebody better off than he was putting up the good fight.

2304
02:12:24.60 --> 02:12:27.60
So you never got to down on yourself.

2305
02:12:27.60 --> 02:12:36.60
No, those are those are important lessons for life right you bet I mean we can complain I'll be the for all be the person complaining about oh I.

2306
02:12:36.60 --> 02:12:48.60
I I I I jumped my finger and I'm all bad about it because I can't do something that's like no you what you need to do is be quiet and as I always say do what you can you know do you can.

2307
02:12:48.60 --> 02:12:51.60
So so you get down.

2308
02:12:51.60 --> 02:13:00.60
So now we're going back to college you got the elevator work and you got a and how long is it takes you to get your your doctor what you get your doctor.

2309
02:13:00.60 --> 02:13:06.60
I got my doctor and and speech language pathology you know with a minor in psychology.

2310
02:13:06.60 --> 02:13:11.60
But it first I had to get the masters and I.

2311
02:13:11.60 --> 02:13:24.60
I'm not sure how the University of Florida looked at my transcript from the Naval Academy and how they factored in you know weapons and navigation and courses like that I that I took but I had to do a whole lot of.

2312
02:13:24.60 --> 02:13:30.60
Under graduate courses before I could you know move into the graduate level course so it took me.

2313
02:13:30.60 --> 02:13:34.60
I think about three years to get the masters to very go into school full time.

2314
02:13:34.60 --> 02:13:37.60
And the VA was you know picking up the tap for that.

2315
02:13:37.60 --> 02:13:46.60
VA isn't very good to me very good and I know there's a lot of complaints out there about the VA and I'm sure some of them are awarded to some degree or another but.

2316
02:13:46.60 --> 02:13:58.60
I don't understand with the VA you know it doesn't happen yesterday doesn't happen five minutes from now it happens it happened down the road but as long as you you know check every box and go from.

2317
02:13:58.60 --> 02:14:04.60
A BCD instead of trying to jump from a to F you know it'll all work for you great.

2318
02:14:04.60 --> 02:14:14.60
And what point did you meet Jerry. I met Sherry after I had my masters degree.

2319
02:14:14.60 --> 02:14:29.60
My work for a year down in Orlando at an Easter Seals community and was a great experience my one of my little profs at the University of Florida invited me to come back up to the medical center there and become one of their staff speech pathologist at the medical center.

2320
02:14:29.60 --> 02:14:37.60
And I was like, I'm sorry, which is why I did that Sherry was a staff occupational therapist had an office that kind of across the hall for me.

2321
02:14:37.60 --> 02:14:54.60
We met we met and being dull normal about these things like most men apparently I didn't catch on fast enough so we had a mutual friend who was in the other master speech pathologist there she had us over for dinner one night great.

2322
02:14:54.60 --> 02:15:04.60
Still didn't get it so we were at a convention one time when summer and we were having lunch together myself and the other speech pathologist who was also a friend of Sherry's.

2323
02:15:04.60 --> 02:15:12.60
And she said, I like, why do you think I invited you and Sherry a work for dinner.

2324
02:15:12.60 --> 02:15:23.60
You like us. She said, listen if you don't when we get back from this convention if you don't ask her out when two weeks she's going to ask you.

2325
02:15:23.60 --> 02:15:42.60
So I asked her out and we went out and we did it for a while and eventually everything fell into place and we got engaged me while I had to kind of give an up on marriage I had dated a fair amount and you know I was just running into wall after wall.

2326
02:15:42.60 --> 02:15:54.60
So but I decided you know I want to be a dad I love kids I always love kids so I went to the children's age society for and I wanted to stop.

2327
02:15:54.60 --> 02:16:10.60
Well back then and this was not the late 60s early 70s they looked at you like you had a hole in your head of course which I did so that was okay.

2328
02:16:10.60 --> 02:16:25.60
They gave me all the stuff to read and all these exercises to go through and said, you come back in a couple of months and if you still want to pursue this thing we'll talk about it. Well so I did and this process took about nine months but eventually I was approved.

2329
02:16:25.60 --> 02:16:45.60
I mean they my everybody my family had it submit letters and all my friends and they just they sliced and dice me one side up one side and down the other because they weren't going to let one other kid I was getting a home some kind of freaking guy and what you totally understand.

2330
02:16:45.60 --> 02:16:56.60
But getting engaged all that went away you know if you're going to get married that's what they wanted they wanted obviously a two person situation for their kids and a stable so.

2331
02:16:56.60 --> 02:17:10.60
If you got engaged or something like that during this process it was over but I had been accepted and sure enough so as we got engaged I call my case work and told her great I way to go and book things the options off though.

2332
02:17:10.60 --> 02:17:15.60
Okay, that's fine. We'll do it the old fashioned way which we did.

2333
02:17:15.60 --> 02:17:21.60
And as this time you still pursuing your doctor and at this time I'm percent of my doctor at this time that's right.

2334
02:17:21.60 --> 02:17:36.60
And that was about seven years going to school half time and we're going to have time you know I'd get a fellowship at the VA and you know half time research fellowship or clinical fellowship and stuff like that and go to school half time.

2335
02:17:36.60 --> 02:17:41.60
I'm going to be a money head run out by then so I was funding this which was fine with me.

2336
02:17:41.60 --> 02:17:48.60
And then at some point you get you finish with the marriage you get married and you start to have kids this is true.

2337
02:17:48.60 --> 02:17:52.60
Matt Matt he's a third kid. Oh, here we go.

2338
02:17:52.60 --> 02:17:55.60
My time to shine. Yeah, this is your moment.

2339
02:17:55.60 --> 02:17:58.60
What was it like for you growing up with a dad?

2340
02:17:58.60 --> 02:18:09.60
You know, I don't think it was a typical childhood compared to my friends. He would charge and earn it probably felt like four in the morning.

2341
02:18:09.60 --> 02:18:12.60
But it was probably more like seven o'clock.

2342
02:18:12.60 --> 02:18:22.60
Wake us up. We'd all be out in the hallway in line like formed up ready to go prior to school and he would you know do what he called belly busters.

2343
02:18:22.60 --> 02:18:33.60
Yes, he morning PT with the family. You know, obviously like it was very limited but we did like push ups set ups jumping jacks.

2344
02:18:33.60 --> 02:18:35.60
What else you have to do?

2345
02:18:35.60 --> 02:18:37.60
It's a lot of the only thing I was thinking of.

2346
02:18:37.60 --> 02:18:42.60
Yeah, and so it was just like I don't think anybody else's kids did that at the time.

2347
02:18:42.60 --> 02:18:43.60
Yeah, right.

2348
02:18:43.60 --> 02:18:47.60
Oh, there you go.

2349
02:18:47.60 --> 02:18:55.60
You'd wake us up by like playing reveli. You know, I knew what reveli was before I joined the military.

2350
02:18:55.60 --> 02:18:59.60
It was, it was, it couldn't shoot gum.

2351
02:18:59.60 --> 02:19:04.60
It was somewhat controlled case. There's a lot of discipline there that maybe other kids didn't have.

2352
02:19:04.60 --> 02:19:10.60
We got a, we got put on restriction, which I didn't know what that was until I went to Naps.

2353
02:19:10.60 --> 02:19:19.60
I guess, possibly being grounded as opposed to being grounded. We got put on restriction and that's just what it was called and we had to like explain what it was to our friends and

2354
02:19:19.60 --> 02:19:22.60
Okay, no, we've got to know what restrictions we're saying.

2355
02:19:22.60 --> 02:19:24.60
What is that?

2356
02:19:24.60 --> 02:19:27.60
So we have to explain that's being grounded.

2357
02:19:27.60 --> 02:19:39.60
Yeah, he was kind of like this, this hero, like a lot of our friends though because he was, he was really good with our friends and he was just like kind of like a wild man.

2358
02:19:39.60 --> 02:19:46.60
He was notorious throughout the school system of not being a guy to mess with if you were like a school administrator.

2359
02:19:46.60 --> 02:19:48.60
I think the,

2360
02:19:48.60 --> 02:19:51.60
Is that one of my kids? I'm going to be talking to you.

2361
02:19:51.60 --> 02:20:01.60
Not in the notes, but I'll tell the story. I think it was sixth grade and I had a friend who would get in trouble in class regularly and you know what, you know,

2362
02:20:01.60 --> 02:20:08.60
I'm the youngest kid, so a lot of teachers knew who I was and my sisters were probably better at school at that time than I was.

2363
02:20:08.60 --> 02:20:13.60
And so, you know, the teacher would pulls me aside one day and she's like, you need to stop being friends with she now.

2364
02:20:13.60 --> 02:20:15.60
You're just a bad influence on you.

2365
02:20:15.60 --> 02:20:19.60
And so I go home, tell my dad that, you know what, we'll see.

2366
02:20:19.60 --> 02:20:29.60
Next day, like it's, you know, the school that has like the loudspeaker that like clicks on from when the office calls and I think, you know, one of the, one of the office staff is like,

2367
02:20:29.60 --> 02:20:44.60
you know, Mr. Schneiderman, I think Mr. Eisenbach is here. She's like, oh, great. I'll send him out down to the office and you could kind of hear it in the voice of the office staff and they're like, no, no, he's, he's here to see you.

2368
02:20:44.60 --> 02:20:49.60
And the whole class is just like, what is happening?

2369
02:20:49.60 --> 02:20:58.60
So yeah, it is, it is clearly different, you know, it's, you know, the growing up with like somebody that is like the essence of the brain core.

2370
02:20:58.60 --> 02:21:01.60
Like discipline kind of like iron fisted.

2371
02:21:01.60 --> 02:21:03.60
This is what people think of.

2372
02:21:03.60 --> 02:21:04.60
But fair.

2373
02:21:04.60 --> 02:21:06.60
Sure.

2374
02:21:06.60 --> 02:21:07.60
Yeah.

2375
02:21:07.60 --> 02:21:09.60
That's what we're calling these days.

2376
02:21:09.60 --> 02:21:18.60
Most of the time, like, you know, there were things that, you know, you just have to do because that's way, I want them done or that's what I said.

2377
02:21:18.60 --> 02:21:19.60
So I didn't matter how much.

2378
02:21:19.60 --> 02:21:20.60
Right.

2379
02:21:20.60 --> 02:21:21.60
Which is like, that's what he wants.

2380
02:21:21.60 --> 02:21:27.60
So, you know, you kind of had to grow up learning just to like, you know, roll with that sort of stuff, which is,

2381
02:21:27.60 --> 02:21:33.60
you know, a lot of what you see in the military is like, we do things this way just because it's the way we do it.

2382
02:21:33.60 --> 02:21:36.60
Or it's, because the way I want it.

2383
02:21:36.60 --> 02:21:41.60
But, you know, not everything is like that in the military, you know, you get, you know, input, which,

2384
02:21:41.60 --> 02:21:45.60
I don't, like, eight years old I have a lot of input and things.

2385
02:21:45.60 --> 02:21:48.60
So what point did you decide you were doing with the Naval Academy?

2386
02:21:48.60 --> 02:21:56.60
Like him, we would schedule trips around the anapolis area to go visit friends and we'd wind up, you know, at the academy or

2387
02:21:56.60 --> 02:21:59.60
you know, we'd be like the logical one.

2388
02:21:59.60 --> 02:22:00.60
We'd work for it.

2389
02:22:00.60 --> 02:22:00.60
Right.

2390
02:22:00.60 --> 02:22:07.60
We'd go, uh, we'd go to San Diego for spring break and go check out the Naval Station, things like that.

2391
02:22:07.60 --> 02:22:13.60
Uh, and so, you know, I kind of known for a while, like, you know, I want to be a pilot.

2392
02:22:13.60 --> 02:22:15.60
This is kind of what I want to do.

2393
02:22:15.60 --> 02:22:19.60
And I think the best way to go about that is probably go to the Naval Academy.

2394
02:22:19.60 --> 02:22:25.60
Um, and so I'd probably like early high school kind of had that idea in mind.

2395
02:22:25.60 --> 02:22:28.60
Like him, I probably wasn't the best student ever.

2396
02:22:28.60 --> 02:22:34.60
Uh, I got better over time, but at that time, I didn't really, like, put a lot of effort into

2397
02:22:34.60 --> 02:22:35.60
school and homework.

2398
02:22:35.60 --> 02:22:43.60
So I had to go to, uh, it was called Naval Academy Prep School, which is, you know, basically an academic year to get you ready for the Naval Academy.

2399
02:22:43.60 --> 02:22:46.60
Um, I found out about restriction there.

2400
02:22:46.60 --> 02:22:48.60
Uh, the little more restriction to everything.

2401
02:22:48.60 --> 02:22:49.60
That was it.

2402
02:22:49.60 --> 02:22:50.60
Right.

2403
02:22:50.60 --> 02:22:54.60
Uh, well, I'll tell you, if I can, my, my, my, my one of my favorite stories about Matt was,

2404
02:22:54.60 --> 02:22:58.60
when he was, uh, getting ready to apply for the Naval Academy, you know,

2405
02:22:58.60 --> 02:23:03.60
I thought he had taken the PSAT or whatever that is, the pre-set.

2406
02:23:03.60 --> 02:23:05.60
And I thought, well, we got to bump this up a little bit.

2407
02:23:05.60 --> 02:23:08.60
So, you know, I'll challenge him.

2408
02:23:08.60 --> 02:23:13.60
So I made a bet when I said, I bet I can score higher on the SAT than you can.

2409
02:23:13.60 --> 02:23:17.60
And he looks me like, of course, that I got three heads and 14 ears.

2410
02:23:17.60 --> 02:23:19.60
Oh, dear.

2411
02:23:19.60 --> 02:23:23.60
So I, I mean, while has strategically bought some of these,

2412
02:23:23.60 --> 02:23:25.60
uh, prep books that I was leaving around the house.

2413
02:23:25.60 --> 02:23:27.60
Because we played a win over here.

2414
02:23:27.60 --> 02:23:28.60
That's right.

2415
02:23:28.60 --> 02:23:31.60
And I hope he would buy into those, you know, he didn't.

2416
02:23:31.60 --> 02:23:37.60
But we scheduled the, the SAT and we took it and the results come back and, you know,

2417
02:23:37.60 --> 02:23:39.60
you gotta be careful with your wish for.

2418
02:23:39.60 --> 02:23:45.60
I outscored him and I, I hate like a 650 or 750 at 800 on the English side.

2419
02:23:45.60 --> 02:23:47.60
And he looks he's dead.

2420
02:23:47.60 --> 02:23:50.60
No, whatever he said, 50 on English.

2421
02:23:50.60 --> 02:23:54.60
So that all just came back to heart me and I, I beat him on that.

2422
02:23:54.60 --> 02:23:57.60
But, uh, right here, you know, he had a lot of things going for me.

2423
02:23:57.60 --> 02:24:01.60
It was an eagle scout, uh, he'd let her in a couple sports at high school.

2424
02:24:01.60 --> 02:24:05.60
And he did, he had a good interview with a, with a building gold officer.

2425
02:24:05.60 --> 02:24:09.60
Fellow who kind of recruits for the NA able academy and, you know, around the area.

2426
02:24:09.60 --> 02:24:11.60
They got him all over the country.

2427
02:24:11.60 --> 02:24:14.60
He helps that he knows all those people too.

2428
02:24:14.60 --> 02:24:16.60
Well, I don't think so.

2429
02:24:16.60 --> 02:24:19.60
But, and I didn't know anybody on the, on the admissions board and when they helped if I did.

2430
02:24:19.60 --> 02:24:21.60
You got in there yourself.

2431
02:24:21.60 --> 02:24:24.60
And you ended up being a, a sub-mariner though.

2432
02:24:24.60 --> 02:24:30.60
Uh, you know, the, you know, the, you look at me like any selection program is going to be tough.

2433
02:24:30.60 --> 02:24:36.60
And there's only a limited number of spots and there's, you know, physical requirements.

2434
02:24:36.60 --> 02:24:39.60
You have to meet, uh, you know, I don't have 20, 20 vision anymore.

2435
02:24:39.60 --> 02:24:43.60
So, uh, probably being a pilot was not in, in the, in the, in the works for me.

2436
02:24:43.60 --> 02:24:48.60
So, I just went, uh, you know, I think I got selected as a surface warfare officer.

2437
02:24:48.60 --> 02:24:51.60
And then, you know, I didn't necessarily want to do that.

2438
02:24:51.60 --> 02:24:54.60
I wanted to do something different, uh, or more challenging.

2439
02:24:54.60 --> 02:24:57.60
And so, I went asked to be a submarine officer.

2440
02:24:57.60 --> 02:25:06.60
And you have to, you have to ask to get an interview with the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

2441
02:25:06.60 --> 02:25:11.60
the captain on the yard who is the, the head submarine officer there.

2442
02:25:11.60 --> 02:25:15.60
And, you know, he looked at all my stuff and said, you picked the wrong major.

2443
02:25:15.60 --> 02:25:20.60
I was an econ major at the time. And, uh, again, probably to have the best grades ever.

2444
02:25:20.60 --> 02:25:26.60
But I was good enough in math and science that he, uh, let me through onto the, the Naval reactors interview.

2445
02:25:26.60 --> 02:25:29.60
So, went from there.

2446
02:25:29.60 --> 02:25:35.60
Uh, you got to go, still kind of like old school where you used to have to go interview with Admiral Rickover and he'd,

2447
02:25:35.60 --> 02:25:39.60
play mine games with you. They still, they keep that traditional life.

2448
02:25:39.60 --> 02:25:44.60
You still go interview with the four star that's headed to Naval reactors, but, uh, fewer mine games.

2449
02:25:44.60 --> 02:25:47.60
More just, you know, technical interview and then go.

2450
02:25:47.60 --> 02:25:49.60
And how many years did you end up doing?

2451
02:25:49.60 --> 02:25:53.60
I did six. I got out in 2012, uh, July of that year.

2452
02:25:53.60 --> 02:25:55.60
So, just a little over six years.

2453
02:25:55.60 --> 02:25:59.60
And so, I, what are you doing now?

2454
02:25:59.60 --> 02:26:04.60
I am, uh, when I call fully retired and doing it immensely.

2455
02:26:04.60 --> 02:26:09.60
After my speech pathology career kind of,

2456
02:26:09.60 --> 02:26:17.60
it just kind of peatered out here in the Pacific Northwest. It's a whole, uh, different, uh, atmosphere and, uh,

2457
02:26:17.60 --> 02:26:22.60
ball game for how I'd held professionals, then it is on the East Coast, which was, okay.

2458
02:26:22.60 --> 02:26:31.60
But, uh, so I, in about, in 95, uh, when it is selling life insurance and mutual funds, uh, which, uh,

2459
02:26:31.60 --> 02:26:35.60
which I enjoyed, but, uh, wasn't wildly successful.

2460
02:26:35.60 --> 02:26:39.60
I was successful enough to, you know, pay the bills and keep some income coming in.

2461
02:26:39.60 --> 02:26:46.60
But finally, uh, uh, uh, uh, good to that and decided to live a life of, uh, leisure.

2462
02:26:46.60 --> 02:26:50.60
Shall we say? But, uh, you know, every day is a little bit different.

2463
02:26:50.60 --> 02:26:53.60
You know, getting up in the morning is not the typical.

2464
02:26:53.60 --> 02:26:58.60
You got to get braces on and, and, uh, make sure you don't fall out of bed.

2465
02:26:58.60 --> 02:27:02.60
You know, my, my, one of my theories is gravity always wins.

2466
02:27:02.60 --> 02:27:07.60
And it always does, you know, so everything is just a little bit more difficult.

2467
02:27:07.60 --> 02:27:12.60
But, uh, it's okay. It sure beats, uh, rein it on and kind of looking up with the,

2468
02:27:12.60 --> 02:27:18.60
sod, uh, which is where I theoretically should be.

2469
02:27:18.60 --> 02:27:23.60
Well, we are, uh, certainly glad that you didn't end up there.

2470
02:27:23.60 --> 02:27:28.60
Yeah, I was. And that you ended up here. It's, uh, it's probably a good place to wrap it up.

2471
02:27:28.60 --> 02:27:33.60
Um, just, uh, just awesome to sit and talk with you. Um, we'll like Goi's, Chicago.

2472
02:27:33.60 --> 02:27:36.60
Did you have any closing thoughts, Matt? Anything that I missed?

2473
02:27:36.60 --> 02:27:39.60
I don't have any closing thoughts.

2474
02:27:39.60 --> 02:27:46.60
Well, you just want to thought, here's, it's just, you, we almost always miss, uh, in the service

2475
02:27:46.60 --> 02:27:51.60
and frankly, in any kind of industry or something. And that's the part that, uh,

2476
02:27:51.60 --> 02:27:56.60
your spouse plays for you. My wife has been terrific over the last 41 years.

2477
02:27:56.60 --> 02:28:01.60
Uh, she's, uh, a, the level of my life and be the mother of my children.

2478
02:28:01.60 --> 02:28:06.60
And, uh, you know, I, I just, I don't think I could get to a week without her.

2479
02:28:06.60 --> 02:28:12.60
Uh, she, she helps me. She points out where I'm, you know, turning left when I'm maybe

2480
02:28:12.60 --> 02:28:15.60
should stay the straight and narrow. You know, she's a good cook.

2481
02:28:15.60 --> 02:28:18.60
Uh, she's pretty good at managing my life.

2482
02:28:18.60 --> 02:28:23.60
And I'll lower dearly.

2483
02:28:23.60 --> 02:28:32.60
Well, that's, that's awesome. And, uh, yeah, like, we, we can often overlook the, the, the, the, the,

2484
02:28:32.60 --> 02:28:36.60
families, you know, whether it's right, the husband, the wife, the kids.

2485
02:28:36.60 --> 02:28:39.60
They all make a huge sacrifice for those that are still in the military.

2486
02:28:39.60 --> 02:28:44.60
You know, they always make this sacrifice to support, you know, their spouse.

2487
02:28:44.60 --> 02:28:48.60
So, absolutely, to the families out there that are out there supporting

2488
02:28:48.60 --> 02:28:54.60
this spouse's, um, thank you to you all. And, sir, you know, it's, it's just been

2489
02:28:54.60 --> 02:28:58.60
on her to sit here and talk with you and, and I feel, thank you for coming on the show.

2490
02:28:58.60 --> 02:29:03.60
More importantly, though, obviously, um, thank you for your, for your, for your service

2491
02:29:03.60 --> 02:29:05.60
and your sacrifice.

2492
02:29:05.60 --> 02:29:08.60
Well, you as well, Dr. Go ahead. Also you, yes.

2493
02:29:08.60 --> 02:29:13.60
Yeah. Well, we're waiting on that echo.

2494
02:29:13.60 --> 02:29:18.60
Uh, everybody serves in their own line. There we go.

2495
02:29:18.60 --> 02:29:21.60
You just gotta, you just gotta, let's go through that.

2496
02:29:21.60 --> 02:29:27.60
We, you know, the, the sacrifice that you made, the efforts that you made, um,

2497
02:29:27.60 --> 02:29:33.60
you know, it's what allows us to be here today as a free people doing what we're doing.

2498
02:29:33.60 --> 02:29:42.60
So, thank you for, for putting your, your own safety and your own life on the line for this country.

2499
02:29:42.60 --> 02:29:45.60
And we deeply appreciate it.

2500
02:29:45.60 --> 02:29:50.60
Well, thank you for your service again. And for all those out there who have served and are serving,

2502
02:29:51.60 --> 02:29:53.60
Awesome.

2503
02:29:53.60 --> 02:29:55.60
Thanks, I appreciate it.

2504
02:29:55.60 --> 02:30:08.60
And with that Charles Robert Ike, Izenbach has left the building and honored to have him on to talk to.

2505
02:30:08.60 --> 02:30:14.60
Here is perspective kind of a crazy life. Start with growing up in the Philippines.

2506
02:30:14.60 --> 02:30:15.60
Yeah.

2507
02:30:15.60 --> 02:30:16.60
The father is dad's.

2508
02:30:16.60 --> 02:30:17.60
I'm like a character.

2509
02:30:17.60 --> 02:30:18.60
Yeah.

2510
02:30:18.60 --> 02:30:20.60
A character.

2511
02:30:20.60 --> 02:30:23.60
He's like, yeah, the, he's like, from the Philippines.

2512
02:30:23.60 --> 02:30:25.60
Right. But not technically Filipino.

2513
02:30:25.60 --> 02:30:29.60
So you know, so they, well, yeah, you're from the Philippines, like, not computing.

2514
02:30:29.60 --> 02:30:30.60
It's good.

2515
02:30:30.60 --> 02:30:32.60
Interesting stuff.

2516
02:30:32.60 --> 02:30:37.60
Um, and this is the awesome for us to sit here and, of course, get to, get to,

2517
02:30:37.60 --> 02:30:46.60
talk with another hero, another individual that just steps up and overcomes.

2518
02:30:46.60 --> 02:30:54.60
Reminding me, reminding us, right?

2519
02:30:54.60 --> 02:30:58.60
That we need to do more.

2520
02:30:58.60 --> 02:31:00.60
That we can do more.

2521
02:31:00.60 --> 02:31:04.60
Is there anything echo Charles that you recommend that we should all do?

2522
02:31:04.60 --> 02:31:05.60
Yeah.

2523
02:31:05.60 --> 02:31:06.60
Okay.

2524
02:31:06.60 --> 02:31:07.60
Of course.

2525
02:31:07.60 --> 02:31:08.60
Okay.

2526
02:31:08.60 --> 02:31:12.60
I think of the many reasons to do due to it.

2527
02:31:12.60 --> 02:31:14.60
So I think we've concluded.

2528
02:31:14.60 --> 02:31:16.60
Number one is that it's fun.

2529
02:31:16.60 --> 02:31:20.60
That should be, however, I don't know if it's the biggest reason.

2530
02:31:20.60 --> 02:31:21.60
I'm not sure.

2531
02:31:21.60 --> 02:31:24.60
It's the reason that we'll keep you with it.

2532
02:31:24.60 --> 02:31:25.60
Oh, yeah.

2533
02:31:25.60 --> 02:31:27.60
There's so many strong reasons though.

2534
02:31:27.60 --> 02:31:30.60
We'll just say, fun slash beneficial.

2535
02:31:30.60 --> 02:31:31.60
Here's the weird thing.

2536
02:31:31.60 --> 02:31:33.60
Like on social media.

2537
02:31:33.60 --> 02:31:37.60
So, somebody asks me all these different questions, all these different questions about,

2538
02:31:37.60 --> 02:31:41.60
what would you do if, what would you do if you have trouble controlling your temper,

2539
02:31:41.60 --> 02:31:44.60
due to, what do you do if you have trouble detaching,

2540
02:31:44.60 --> 02:31:47.60
or what's a good way to learn to detach, due to, due to, due to, due to,

2541
02:31:47.60 --> 02:31:49.60
what's a good workout to start getting in shape, due to,

2542
02:31:49.60 --> 02:31:52.60
what's a good way to let off steam and not get stressed out, due to.

2543
02:31:52.60 --> 02:31:53.60
You see what I'm saying?

2544
02:31:53.60 --> 02:31:54.60
Yes.

2545
02:31:54.60 --> 02:31:56.60
This is the answer answer answer answer answer answer.

2546
02:31:56.60 --> 02:31:57.60
So, yeah.

2547
02:31:57.60 --> 02:32:01.60
Pretty much across the board, what we are saying, due to, due to, due to,

2548
02:32:01.60 --> 02:32:05.60
what we are talking about is, when you do due to, you get it taboo key,

2549
02:32:05.60 --> 02:32:09.60
for sure you're gonna need a key, so when you do key,

2550
02:32:09.60 --> 02:32:12.60
this is the key you're gonna get, origin key.

2551
02:32:12.60 --> 02:32:15.60
That's not just one origin key, get as many as you want,

2552
02:32:15.60 --> 02:32:19.60
but you have different selections, as I'm saying, same same.

2553
02:32:19.60 --> 02:32:24.60
So, one of the reasons to get an origin key, not that it's fun,

2554
02:32:24.60 --> 02:32:26.60
it is fun to get an origin key.

2555
02:32:26.60 --> 02:32:28.60
Sure, it is fun to get an origin key, but.

2556
02:32:28.60 --> 02:32:32.60
They're actually the best thing, because how are all my personal feels when they shop?

2557
02:32:32.60 --> 02:32:32.60
Yes.

2558
02:32:32.60 --> 02:32:34.60
What do they call it?

2559
02:32:34.60 --> 02:32:37.60
Like, some therapy, shopping, or is it that?

2560
02:32:37.60 --> 02:32:38.60
What is called shop therapy?

2561
02:32:38.60 --> 02:32:40.60
Yeah, it sounds like what it's called.

2562
02:32:40.60 --> 02:32:43.60
No, oh, yeah, I don't know, but it's that situation,

2563
02:32:43.60 --> 02:32:45.60
or it's therapeutic to go shopping.

2564
02:32:45.60 --> 02:32:47.60
Some people just go winter shopping.

2565
02:32:47.60 --> 02:32:52.60
I think what I have you ever heard might me rage against consumerism,

2566
02:32:52.60 --> 02:32:54.60
because I'll do it right now.

2567
02:32:54.60 --> 02:32:57.60
Well, you know, you people buy everything, right?

2568
02:32:57.60 --> 02:33:02.60
I think what happens is there is a certain level of gratification that you get from building something,

2569
02:33:02.60 --> 02:33:03.60
making something, right?

2570
02:33:03.60 --> 02:33:04.60
Yes.

2571
02:33:04.60 --> 02:33:09.60
Whether it's a brick wall, whether it's a re-paying and drywall in the kitchen,

2572
02:33:09.60 --> 02:33:14.60
like it, there's a satisfaction that you get from it from creating something.

2573
02:33:14.60 --> 02:33:18.60
Well, I hate to say it, but sometimes for some people,

2574
02:33:18.60 --> 02:33:21.60
shopping starts to kind of replace that.

2575
02:33:21.60 --> 02:33:22.60
Yeah.

2576
02:33:22.60 --> 02:33:25.60
And they want to create something cool, they can just click on Amazon,

2577
02:33:25.60 --> 02:33:27.60
and it's common, and they kind of get a little bit of a little bit of it.

2578
02:33:27.60 --> 02:33:29.60
A little dose of it feels good.

2579
02:33:29.60 --> 02:33:30.60
Yes.

2580
02:33:30.60 --> 02:33:33.60
So there is that when you buy an orange and ghee, I will say you feel a little bit,

2581
02:33:33.60 --> 02:33:37.60
and what's better though, is when you buy an orange and ghee,

2582
02:33:37.60 --> 02:33:43.60
what you kind of feel, you look, when you buy some random thing off of Amazon.com,

2583
02:33:43.60 --> 02:33:45.60
you don't know where that thing came from, right?

2584
02:33:45.60 --> 02:33:47.60
You're not contracted to it.

2585
02:33:47.60 --> 02:33:51.60
You buy an orange and ghee, you know what exactly what's happening.

2586
02:33:51.60 --> 02:33:52.60
You know exactly where it came from.

2587
02:33:52.60 --> 02:33:53.60
You know what it means.

2588
02:33:53.60 --> 02:33:54.60
It's true.

2589
02:33:54.60 --> 02:33:55.60
You know what it represents.

2590
02:33:55.60 --> 02:33:56.60
True.

2591
02:33:56.60 --> 02:33:58.60
You know that it has, so...

2592
02:33:58.60 --> 02:33:59.60
So...

2593
02:33:59.60 --> 02:34:00.60
So...

2594
02:34:00.60 --> 02:34:01.60
Heck yes.

2595
02:34:01.60 --> 02:34:02.60
So get yourself an orange and...

2596
02:34:02.60 --> 02:34:04.60
Well, what you're talking about is completely correct.

2597
02:34:04.60 --> 02:34:06.60
Well, so I had both, so you know you're saying,

2598
02:34:06.60 --> 02:34:09.60
making something or doing something, creating something, creating something.

2599
02:34:09.60 --> 02:34:10.60
Yes.

2600
02:34:10.60 --> 02:34:11.60
So this may or may not count.

2601
02:34:11.60 --> 02:34:14.60
So I switched the door some door knobs in my house.

2602
02:34:14.60 --> 02:34:15.60
Big done.

2603
02:34:15.60 --> 02:34:16.60
Right?

2604
02:34:16.60 --> 02:34:17.60
You seem saying that.

2605
02:34:17.60 --> 02:34:18.60
But you got gratification, right?

2606
02:34:18.60 --> 02:34:19.60
Yeah.

2607
02:34:19.60 --> 02:34:20.60
So you have the right satisfaction.

2608
02:34:20.60 --> 02:34:22.60
But good about it, especially you shut that door because

2609
02:34:22.60 --> 02:34:23.60
you shut that door.

2610
02:34:23.60 --> 02:34:24.60
Yeah.

2611
02:34:24.60 --> 02:34:25.60
Shut the salad.

2612
02:34:25.60 --> 02:34:26.60
Yeah.

2613
02:34:26.60 --> 02:34:27.60
Heck yeah.

2614
02:34:27.60 --> 02:34:32.60
Well, one of them, the locking thing was like jammed up yet to use the thing.

2615
02:34:32.60 --> 02:34:33.60
It was just give me issues.

2616
02:34:33.60 --> 02:34:34.60
Mm-hmm.

2617
02:34:34.60 --> 02:34:35.60
Like given the duobrocombe.

2618
02:34:35.60 --> 02:34:39.60
The state of my door knob, that was like that wasn't an acceptable state.

2619
02:34:39.60 --> 02:34:40.60
Okay.

2620
02:34:40.60 --> 02:34:44.60
Isn't my room fixing that whole situation was like that.

2621
02:34:44.60 --> 02:34:46.60
That was something that needed to be done.

2622
02:34:46.60 --> 02:34:48.60
And I did it by myself.

2623
02:34:48.60 --> 02:34:49.60
Same thing with the...

2624
02:34:49.60 --> 02:34:50.60
A different door knob.

2625
02:34:50.60 --> 02:34:51.60
Yeah.

2626
02:34:51.60 --> 02:34:52.60
It needed a lock.

2627
02:34:52.60 --> 02:34:53.60
It didn't have a lock.

2628
02:34:53.60 --> 02:34:54.60
Okay.

2629
02:34:54.60 --> 02:34:56.60
So there's three altogether with different issues.

2630
02:34:56.60 --> 02:34:57.60
Same same.

2631
02:34:57.60 --> 02:34:58.60
But, okay.

2632
02:34:58.60 --> 02:34:59.60
So it did it.

2633
02:34:59.60 --> 02:35:00.60
Yes.

2634
02:35:00.60 --> 02:35:01.60
University of overcame it.

2635
02:35:01.60 --> 02:35:02.60
Overcame it.

2636
02:35:02.60 --> 02:35:03.60
It did it gratification.

2637
02:35:03.60 --> 02:35:06.60
But on top of that, I shopped for the new door knobs on Amazon.

2638
02:35:06.60 --> 02:35:08.60
And I got gratification from that too.

2639
02:35:08.60 --> 02:35:09.60
Same thing.

2640
02:35:09.60 --> 02:35:10.60
But.

2641
02:35:10.60 --> 02:35:13.60
So that fact does remain.

2642
02:35:13.60 --> 02:35:19.60
But with the ghee, you have the additional gratification.

2643
02:35:19.60 --> 02:35:21.60
And of course, they're the best ghee in the world.

2644
02:35:21.60 --> 02:35:22.60
But they are made in America.

2645
02:35:22.60 --> 02:35:23.60
Imagine that.

2646
02:35:23.60 --> 02:35:26.60
Like, you know when you're a kid, you want the best car.

2647
02:35:26.60 --> 02:35:27.60
Yes.

2648
02:35:27.60 --> 02:35:28.60
But it's hard to afford that car.

2649
02:35:28.60 --> 02:35:29.60
Yeah.

2650
02:35:29.60 --> 02:35:30.60
Orgian ghee.

2651
02:35:30.60 --> 02:35:31.60
It's like, oh, you want the best ghee cool.

2652
02:35:31.60 --> 02:35:32.60
Yeah.

2653
02:35:32.60 --> 02:35:33.60
You can make it happen.

2654
02:35:33.60 --> 02:35:34.60
Yeah.

2655
02:35:34.60 --> 02:35:37.60
Or you could go get the not the not best ghee up to you.

2656
02:35:37.60 --> 02:35:40.60
But I mean, it's well, that's on you though.

2657
02:35:40.60 --> 02:35:41.60
It's face it.

2658
02:35:41.60 --> 02:35:42.60
That's on you.

2659
02:35:42.60 --> 02:35:43.60
That's not encouraged to be able.

2660
02:35:43.60 --> 02:35:44.60
Oh no.

2661
02:35:44.60 --> 02:35:45.60
Man.

2662
02:35:45.60 --> 02:35:46.60
And the last.

2663
02:35:46.60 --> 02:35:48.60
Get your ghee.

2664
02:35:48.60 --> 02:35:49.60
Orgian.

2665
02:35:49.60 --> 02:35:50.60
Main.

2666
02:35:50.60 --> 02:35:51.60
Yeah.

2667
02:35:51.60 --> 02:35:57.88
And the good thing is if you need other clothing items outside the realm of jujitsu, outside the realm of

2668
02:35:57.88 --> 02:36:03.88
geese, outside the realm of rashguards, then you can get other clothing materials, such as t-shirts,

2669
02:36:03.88 --> 02:36:07.60
such as hoodies, such as yes, jeans.

2670
02:36:07.60 --> 02:36:09.60
American, made denim.

2671
02:36:09.60 --> 02:36:10.60
Yeah.

2672
02:36:10.60 --> 02:36:11.60
Same deal.

2673
02:36:11.60 --> 02:36:13.60
And you might be thinking, well, why stop there?

2674
02:36:13.60 --> 02:36:14.60
Don't worry.

2675
02:36:14.60 --> 02:36:15.60
We didn't stop there.

2676
02:36:15.60 --> 02:36:16.60
We didn't stop there.

2677
02:36:16.60 --> 02:36:17.60
We didn't stop there.

2678
02:36:17.60 --> 02:36:18.60
We didn't stop there.

2679
02:36:18.60 --> 02:36:20.60
But you know where the letters from though?

2680
02:36:20.60 --> 02:36:21.60
Where?

2681
02:36:21.60 --> 02:36:22.60
Oh, it's from America.

2682
02:36:22.60 --> 02:36:24.60
You know where the stitching is from though?

2683
02:36:24.60 --> 02:36:25.60
Yes.

2684
02:36:25.60 --> 02:36:26.60
Yeah.

2685
02:36:26.60 --> 02:36:27.60
From America.

2686
02:36:27.60 --> 02:36:29.60
Well, you know where they're actually assembled though, to be honest with you?

2687
02:36:29.60 --> 02:36:30.60
America.

2688
02:36:30.60 --> 02:36:35.60
And then there's some supplementation.

2689
02:36:35.60 --> 02:36:36.60
Yeah.

2690
02:36:36.60 --> 02:36:37.60
Yes.

2691
02:36:37.60 --> 02:36:40.60
The most important kind of supplements by the way.

2692
02:36:40.60 --> 02:36:42.60
The ones that work.

2693
02:36:42.60 --> 02:36:46.60
And well, in the case of mulk, the kind of taste like dessert.

2694
02:36:46.60 --> 02:36:49.60
So yes, that is the best kind of supplement in my opinion.

2695
02:36:49.60 --> 02:36:51.60
But joint warfare, cruel oil.

2696
02:36:51.60 --> 02:36:52.60
These are for you joints.

2697
02:36:52.60 --> 02:36:53.60
Keep you in the game.

2698
02:36:53.60 --> 02:36:54.60
That's a big deal.

2699
02:36:54.60 --> 02:36:57.60
Like, doesn't matter how much I'm saying that is the deal.

2700
02:36:57.60 --> 02:36:58.60
It's the deal.

2701
02:36:58.60 --> 02:36:59.60
It's a real deal.

2702
02:36:59.60 --> 02:37:01.60
If you're not in the game, then you just sort of know the game.

2703
02:37:01.60 --> 02:37:02.60
Yeah.

2704
02:37:02.60 --> 02:37:06.60
You know how like, you know, the kind of where you're super strong, but like your elbows

2705
02:37:06.60 --> 02:37:08.60
or jamming you up so hard, like, probably you're not strong.

2706
02:37:08.60 --> 02:37:09.60
No.

2707
02:37:09.60 --> 02:37:10.60
Because your elbows can't take it.

2708
02:37:10.60 --> 02:37:11.60
You're not strong.

2709
02:37:11.60 --> 02:37:12.60
So yeah, joint warfare, cruel oil.

2710
02:37:12.60 --> 02:37:13.60
Also disciplined.

2711
02:37:13.60 --> 02:37:14.60
That's for your brain.

2712
02:37:14.60 --> 02:37:15.60
Brain and body.

2713
02:37:15.60 --> 02:37:18.60
It's a brain body sort of scenario.

2714
02:37:18.60 --> 02:37:19.60
Look at you.

2715
02:37:19.60 --> 02:37:22.60
That is becoming everyday one for me, by the way.

2716
02:37:22.60 --> 02:37:23.60
Oh, you're on this.

2717
02:37:23.60 --> 02:37:27.60
Detrain all day or away with a deep plane discipline, plain, the deep plane.

2718
02:37:27.60 --> 02:37:28.60
Where was it that?

2719
02:37:28.60 --> 02:37:29.60
I think Dave Burke.

2720
02:37:29.60 --> 02:37:30.60
Is that really good?

2721
02:37:30.60 --> 02:37:32.60
Oh, he is a weight good dude.

2722
02:37:32.60 --> 02:37:36.60
I think I'm pretty sure I'm not sure.

2723
02:37:36.60 --> 02:37:38.60
Let me come from that later.

2724
02:37:38.60 --> 02:37:42.60
But nonetheless, discipline, free-brain, everyday and helps.

2725
02:37:42.60 --> 02:37:43.60
Toolly does help.

2726
02:37:43.60 --> 02:37:45.60
More calps every day too, especially when you got that.

2727
02:37:45.60 --> 02:37:48.60
That little post dinner.

2728
02:37:48.60 --> 02:37:49.60
You want a little something.

2729
02:37:49.60 --> 02:37:50.60
Let's face it.

2730
02:37:50.60 --> 02:37:51.60
You, let's face it.

2731
02:37:51.60 --> 02:37:53.60
Stake is awesome.

2732
02:37:53.60 --> 02:37:55.60
We all know that.

2733
02:37:55.60 --> 02:37:58.60
But let's just face the facts.

2734
02:37:58.60 --> 02:38:01.60
Sometimes you get done and you got that little craving.

2735
02:38:01.60 --> 02:38:03.60
That little, that little want.

2736
02:38:03.60 --> 02:38:05.60
She wants something called dessert.

2737
02:38:05.60 --> 02:38:07.60
But you know, it's not part of the plan.

2738
02:38:07.60 --> 02:38:08.60
You're just not on the program.

2739
02:38:08.60 --> 02:38:10.60
You know it is not on the path, certainly.

2740
02:38:10.60 --> 02:38:11.60
Yes.

2741
02:38:11.60 --> 02:38:13.60
Cake is not on the path.

2742
02:38:13.60 --> 02:38:14.60
But that's okay.

2743
02:38:14.60 --> 02:38:15.60
We got you.

2744
02:38:15.60 --> 02:38:17.60
You can have dessert.

2745
02:38:17.60 --> 02:38:20.60
You get such off some milk.

2746
02:38:20.60 --> 02:38:21.60
You're also for the kids.

2747
02:38:21.60 --> 02:38:22.60
Where are your kids?

2748
02:38:22.60 --> 02:38:23.60
So same deal.

2749
02:38:23.60 --> 02:38:24.60
Same deal.

2750
02:38:24.60 --> 02:38:25.60
But more engineered for the kids.

2751
02:38:25.60 --> 02:38:28.60
Would you say is that safe to say engineered for the kids?

2752
02:38:28.60 --> 02:38:31.60
Speaking of engineering for the kids.

2753
02:38:31.60 --> 02:38:32.60
You know what?

2754
02:38:32.60 --> 02:38:33.60
I'm not even going to mention it.

2755
02:38:33.60 --> 02:38:34.60
But there is an artifact.

2756
02:38:34.60 --> 02:38:46.60
Artifact, artifacts are on the product that we sampled at the vitamin shop situation.

2757
02:38:46.60 --> 02:38:50.60
We allowed to talk about this because it might be like against some big reveal plan.

2758
02:38:50.60 --> 02:38:51.60
You see what I'm saying?

2759
02:38:51.60 --> 02:38:53.60
Are you talking about milk bars?

2760
02:38:53.60 --> 02:38:55.60
It's been revealed.

2761
02:38:55.60 --> 02:38:56.60
Okay.

2762
02:38:56.60 --> 02:38:57.60
All right.

2763
02:38:57.60 --> 02:38:58.60
There you go.

2764
02:38:58.60 --> 02:39:00.60
Well nonetheless, look, that is going to be like another level even.

2765
02:39:00.60 --> 02:39:04.60
Another layer of post-dinner dessert situation.

2766
02:39:04.60 --> 02:39:05.60
Same thing.

2767
02:39:05.60 --> 02:39:06.60
Yeah.

2768
02:39:06.60 --> 02:39:07.60
I do know what you're saying.

2769
02:39:07.60 --> 02:39:09.60
Because it is a candy bar.

2770
02:39:09.60 --> 02:39:10.60
Straight up.

2771
02:39:10.60 --> 02:39:10.60
Straight up.

2772
02:39:10.60 --> 02:39:11.60
Good for you.

2773
02:39:11.60 --> 02:39:12.60
Yeah.

2774
02:39:12.60 --> 02:39:13.60
And legitimately good for you.

2775
02:39:13.60 --> 02:39:14.60
Oh yeah.

2776
02:39:14.60 --> 02:39:15.60
Don't taste like it.

2777
02:39:15.60 --> 02:39:16.60
This is not normal.

2778
02:39:16.60 --> 02:39:17.60
This is good.

2779
02:39:17.60 --> 02:39:18.60
Yeah.

2780
02:39:18.60 --> 02:39:20.60
It was different than when I was used to for sure.

2781
02:39:20.60 --> 02:39:21.60
But the last thing.

2782
02:39:21.60 --> 02:39:22.60
Yeah.

2783
02:39:22.60 --> 02:39:23.60
You know what I have of those right now?

2784
02:39:23.60 --> 02:39:24.60
How many?

2785
02:39:24.60 --> 02:39:25.60
Mark bars.

2786
02:39:25.60 --> 02:39:27.60
I have 200.

2787
02:39:27.60 --> 02:39:28.60
Oh, you grabbed them all.

2788
02:39:28.60 --> 02:39:29.60
See, that's where they went.

2789
02:39:29.60 --> 02:39:30.60
Yeah.

2790
02:39:30.60 --> 02:39:32.60
I was wondering where did those go?

2791
02:39:32.60 --> 02:39:33.60
Because I kind of wanted someone to know.

2792
02:39:33.60 --> 02:39:35.60
I never want anything.

2793
02:39:35.60 --> 02:39:36.60
Like I'm always like, oh no, keep it.

2794
02:39:36.60 --> 02:39:37.60
No, you can have it.

2795
02:39:37.60 --> 02:39:39.60
No, you know, because that's just my kind of my personality.

2796
02:39:39.60 --> 02:39:42.60
Like I don't even want to have that other stuff.

2797
02:39:42.60 --> 02:39:43.60
Yeah.

2798
02:39:43.60 --> 02:39:44.60
No.

2799
02:39:44.60 --> 02:39:45.60
They were like, oh, I took them all.

2800
02:39:45.60 --> 02:39:47.60
I put them all right my car.

2801
02:39:47.60 --> 02:39:48.60
Okay.

2802
02:39:48.60 --> 02:39:49.60
All right.

2803
02:39:49.60 --> 02:39:50.60
So I got all those.

2804
02:39:50.60 --> 02:39:51.60
No, I don't want you to do the right thing.

2805
02:39:51.60 --> 02:39:52.60
Yeah.

2806
02:39:52.60 --> 02:39:54.60
I don't want you to do the right thing.

2807
02:39:54.60 --> 02:39:55.60
Yeah.

2808
02:39:55.60 --> 02:39:56.60
Yeah.

2809
02:39:56.60 --> 02:39:57.60
Okay.

2810
02:39:57.60 --> 02:39:58.60
Cool.

2811
02:39:58.60 --> 02:39:59.60
Long bars.

2812
02:39:59.60 --> 02:40:01.60
Many more bars as you need.

2813
02:40:01.60 --> 02:40:02.60
Anyway.

2814
02:40:02.60 --> 02:40:03.60
So yes.

2815
02:40:03.60 --> 02:40:04.60
So, moq bars.

2816
02:40:04.60 --> 02:40:07.60
Not currently available, but on the horizon.

2817
02:40:07.60 --> 02:40:08.60
On the horizon.

2818
02:40:08.60 --> 02:40:09.60
Jockel White tea is available right now.

2819
02:40:09.60 --> 02:40:10.60
Yes.

2820
02:40:10.60 --> 02:40:19.60
If you need something organic in your life, could you want to feel like one of those people that is, you know, healthier than you are?

2821
02:40:19.60 --> 02:40:20.60
Oh, yeah.

2822
02:40:20.60 --> 02:40:21.60
Now you can come back at him.

2823
02:40:21.60 --> 02:40:22.60
What someone's like, is that organic?

2824
02:40:22.60 --> 02:40:23.60
Actually, yes it is.

2825
02:40:23.60 --> 02:40:26.60
Otherwise, I wouldn't put it in my body.

2826
02:40:26.60 --> 02:40:29.60
We would say, I'm the middle of the world of an organic organic.

2827
02:40:29.60 --> 02:40:30.60
What?

2828
02:40:30.60 --> 02:40:31.60
Step.

2829
02:40:31.60 --> 02:40:32.60
So, there you go.

2830
02:40:32.60 --> 02:40:35.60
And by the way, the stuff is all available at the wind and shop.

2831
02:40:35.60 --> 02:40:36.60
Nationwide.

2832
02:40:36.60 --> 02:40:39.60
Which is pretty.

2833
02:40:39.60 --> 02:40:41.60
It's convenient, bottom line.

2834
02:40:41.60 --> 02:40:42.60
Yeah.

2835
02:40:42.60 --> 02:40:43.60
And only that sign.

2836
02:40:43.60 --> 02:40:46.60
I'm a little troubled with convenience, right?

2837
02:40:46.60 --> 02:40:48.36
Convenience, all of a sudden you know what.

2838
02:40:48.36 --> 02:40:50.60
Is there a slippery slope to make Donald's.

2839
02:40:50.60 --> 02:40:51.60
There's no.

2840
02:40:51.60 --> 02:40:52.60
No.

2841
02:40:52.60 --> 02:40:53.60
There's not.

2842
02:40:53.60 --> 02:40:54.60
No, that's not.

2843
02:40:54.60 --> 02:40:55.64
Don't let that happen.

2844
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:56.40
Yes sir.

2845
02:40:56.40 --> 02:40:58.44
Also we have a store called

2846
02:40:58.44 --> 02:41:00.44
Jocco store.

2847
02:41:00.44 --> 02:41:01.56
They always said this.

2848
02:41:01.56 --> 02:41:02.68
We have a store.

2849
02:41:02.68 --> 02:41:03.40
Yeah, Jocco.

2850
02:41:03.40 --> 02:41:03.96
We do.

2851
02:41:03.96 --> 02:41:05.16
But it's not just you and me.

2852
02:41:05.16 --> 02:41:05.96
It's all of us.

2853
02:41:05.96 --> 02:41:06.68
We the whole group.

2854
02:41:06.68 --> 02:41:07.16
We have a collective.

2855
02:41:07.16 --> 02:41:08.28
Everyone here has a store.

2856
02:41:08.28 --> 02:41:09.08
Your own store.

2857
02:41:09.08 --> 02:41:10.84
You are our own store.

2858
02:41:10.84 --> 02:41:12.04
We could have called it that.

2859
02:41:12.04 --> 02:41:13.56
But we didn't think of that back then.

2860
02:41:13.56 --> 02:41:15.72
A store could have just the people you know.

2861
02:41:15.72 --> 02:41:16.28
Our store.

2862
02:41:16.28 --> 02:41:17.72
The trooper store.

2863
02:41:17.72 --> 02:41:18.12
Sure.

2864
02:41:18.12 --> 02:41:19.80
For people that are just getting after it.

2865
02:41:19.80 --> 02:41:21.80
Anyways, if you if you're getting after it,

2866
02:41:21.80 --> 02:41:22.92
maybe you need a rashguard.

2867
02:41:22.92 --> 02:41:24.12
Maybe you need a t-shirt.

2868
02:41:24.12 --> 02:41:25.40
Maybe you need a hat.

2869
02:41:25.40 --> 02:41:28.20
If you're echo, you don't need a hat because he doesn't wear a hat.

2870
02:41:28.20 --> 02:41:29.40
Very rarely.

2871
02:41:29.40 --> 02:41:30.92
I've never seen you with a hat.

2872
02:41:30.92 --> 02:41:32.28
Not even for one second.

2873
02:41:32.28 --> 02:41:33.80
Not even in the cold weather.

2874
02:41:33.80 --> 02:41:34.28
No.

2875
02:41:34.28 --> 02:41:36.52
I don't think, wait, maybe I seen you in an orange and beanie.

2876
02:41:36.52 --> 02:41:39.08
I think you've never seen me in cold weather.

2877
02:41:39.08 --> 02:41:40.20
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2878
02:41:40.20 --> 02:41:41.20
You taught.

2879
02:41:41.20 --> 02:41:42.20
That was cold weather.

2880
02:41:42.20 --> 02:41:43.20
19 degrees.

2881
02:41:43.20 --> 02:41:44.20
Yeah, you must have had a hat on out there.

2882
02:41:44.20 --> 02:41:46.20
I don't know if I didn't know.

2883
02:41:46.20 --> 02:41:47.20
Yeah, I had a beanie on you.

2884
02:41:47.20 --> 02:41:48.20
Yeah, you ran you.

2885
02:41:48.20 --> 02:41:49.20

02:41:49.20 --> 02:41:50.88

Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.

2889
02:41:57.72 --> 02:42:00.24
I think it's important.

2890
02:42:00.24 --> 02:42:02.44
Verying levels of importance, but yeah, do it.

2891
02:42:02.44 --> 02:42:03.64
Leave a review if you're in the mood.

2892
02:42:03.64 --> 02:42:09.04
It's kind of cool thing to do to kind of like just confirm where you're at in your

2893
02:42:09.04 --> 02:42:10.04
mental space.

2894
02:42:10.04 --> 02:42:11.04
I think so.

2895
02:42:11.04 --> 02:42:17.20
Don't forget about the grounded podcast, which is part of the Deafcore Network.

2896
02:42:17.20 --> 02:42:18.36
You didn't know about that, did you?

2897
02:42:18.36 --> 02:42:21.72
We got a whole network called the Deafcore Network.

2898
02:42:21.72 --> 02:42:23.76
We're building a network.

2899
02:42:23.76 --> 02:42:25.56
We got free podcasts on it.

2900
02:42:25.56 --> 02:42:30.44
Jocco podcast, grounded podcast, and warrior kid podcast.

2901
02:42:30.44 --> 02:42:33.16
You can subscribe to all of them if you want or none of them.

2902
02:42:33.16 --> 02:42:34.32
Whatever.

2903
02:42:34.32 --> 02:42:40.88
You can also check out warrior kid soap at IrishOx Ranch.com.

2904
02:42:40.88 --> 02:42:45.36
There's a kid who's been a warrior kid since day one in the game.

2905
02:42:45.36 --> 02:42:46.36
And guess what?

2906
02:42:46.36 --> 02:42:47.92
He makes his own soap from goat milk.

2907
02:42:47.92 --> 02:42:48.92
He goes to the he raise.

2908
02:42:48.92 --> 02:42:53.000
And we have a new soap, a new soap.

2909
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:58.24
It's called, well, it's got some active ingredients that help fighting against bacteria.

2910
02:42:58.24 --> 02:43:00.52
I don't really know what I'm talking about.

2911
02:43:00.52 --> 02:43:02.52
Well, bacteria.

2912
02:43:02.52 --> 02:43:04.16
My cromials.

2913
02:43:04.16 --> 02:43:05.16
My crubs.

2914
02:43:05.16 --> 02:43:06.16
Yeah.

2915
02:43:06.16 --> 02:43:07.16
Those funguses.

2916
02:43:07.16 --> 02:43:08.16
Yeah, fun guy.

2917
02:43:08.16 --> 02:43:11.36
Yeah, all these things.

2918
02:43:11.36 --> 02:43:12.36
All these things.

2919
02:43:12.36 --> 02:43:14.08
All the things need to be defeated.

2920
02:43:14.08 --> 02:43:16.08
So we have a soap.

2921
02:43:16.08 --> 02:43:18.000
And it's called killer soap.

2922
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:22.96
And if you use it, it will help you to.

2923
02:43:22.96 --> 02:43:23.96
You can make it.

2924
02:43:23.96 --> 02:43:24.96
You can do it.

2925
02:43:24.96 --> 02:43:26.60
Also YouTube.

2926
02:43:26.60 --> 02:43:31.60
YouTube channel, you're interested in the video version of this podcast.

2927
02:43:31.60 --> 02:43:33.48
Or excerpts from the podcast.

2928
02:43:33.48 --> 02:43:39.28
You know, necessarily want to watch the whole thing all at once all the time.

2929
02:43:39.28 --> 02:43:45.20
Or let's just say you might think that the world would be better place if as the world

2930
02:43:45.20 --> 02:43:48.08
unfolded and things happen.

2931
02:43:48.08 --> 02:43:51.28
That part of the world exploded or caught on fire.

2932
02:43:51.28 --> 02:44:00.40
Because echo, because he has command of virtual reality, he can make my words make things

2933
02:44:00.40 --> 02:44:01.40
explode.

2934
02:44:01.40 --> 02:44:07.92
He can make my kettlebell make things blow up.

2935
02:44:07.92 --> 02:44:08.60
Yes.

2936
02:44:08.60 --> 02:44:16.60
He can make his own magical powers be revealed in forms of like sparks.

2937
02:44:16.60 --> 02:44:18.60
I think I'm so inclined.

2938
02:44:18.60 --> 02:44:19.60
Yeah.

2939
02:44:19.60 --> 02:44:20.60
So that's echo troughs.

2940
02:44:20.60 --> 02:44:23.16
Not be able to control everything in the world.

2941
02:44:23.16 --> 02:44:27.20
But on the Jaco YouTube channel, he can make things happen.

2942
02:44:27.20 --> 02:44:28.20
Yeah, sure.

2943
02:44:28.20 --> 02:44:29.20
And video.

2944
02:44:29.20 --> 02:44:30.20
He's proud of that.

2945
02:44:30.20 --> 02:44:34.20
I mean, he's explosions in a while, but you know, yeah, we're going to continue that

2946
02:44:34.20 --> 02:44:35.20
from time to time.

2947
02:44:35.20 --> 02:44:36.20
I think.

2948
02:44:36.20 --> 02:44:37.20
I hope.

2949
02:44:37.20 --> 02:44:39.52
We also got kind of now called psychological warfare.

2950
02:44:39.52 --> 02:44:47.24
It's a little psychological hitter if you need a little bump to get you over a bump.

2951
02:44:47.24 --> 02:44:50.56
You can check that out on iTunes, Google Play or any MP3.

2952
02:44:50.56 --> 02:44:57.96
We got flipside cambets.com where Dakota Meyer is making visual representations of discipline.

2953
02:44:57.96 --> 02:45:06.40
Pure, distilled onto a canvas that you can then hang on your wall and it will keep you

2954
02:45:06.40 --> 02:45:07.40
on the path.

2955
02:45:07.40 --> 02:45:11.40
Also got a bunch of books, leadership strategy, and tactics, you know manual.

2956
02:45:11.40 --> 02:45:18.80
May the warrior kid got three of those books, got Mikey in the dragons for the little

2957
02:45:18.80 --> 02:45:21.72
kids, got the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2958
02:45:21.72 --> 02:45:28.20
The audio version of that is on iTunes and Amazon, music and Google Play as an MP3.

2959
02:45:28.20 --> 02:45:32.60
We got extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership, the fundamentals of combat leadership

2960
02:45:32.60 --> 02:45:35.84
that I wrote about with my brother, Dave Babin.

2961
02:45:35.84 --> 02:45:40.60
We have Eshelon Front, which is our leadership consultancy and what we do is we solve

2962
02:45:40.60 --> 02:45:43.04
problems through leadership.

2963
02:45:43.04 --> 02:45:46.60
Go to Ashelonfront.com if you need to help in your organization with that.

2964
02:45:46.60 --> 02:45:52.44
We got EF Online, which is online leadership training to get you up to speed as a leader.

2965
02:45:52.44 --> 02:45:54.56
Go to EF Online.com for that.

2966
02:45:54.56 --> 02:46:00.88
We've got the muster, which is our live conference, gathering seminar.

2967
02:46:00.88 --> 02:46:06.56
I gotta think of a better word because it's better than all those three things.

2968
02:46:06.56 --> 02:46:08.52
Everyone that we've done has sold out.

2969
02:46:08.52 --> 02:46:14.04
This year we are doing Orlando, we are doing Phoenix and we are doing Dallas.

2970
02:46:14.04 --> 02:46:19.56
If you want to come, go to extremalorship.com every one of these that we have done has

2971
02:46:19.56 --> 02:46:21.08
sold out and these are going to sell out too.

2972
02:46:21.08 --> 02:46:22.40
So get there early.

2973
02:46:22.40 --> 02:46:31.64
And also if you need leaders at any level in your organization, check out EF Overwatch.com

2974
02:46:31.64 --> 02:46:38.08
for executive leadership, check out EF Legion.com for Frontline Leadership.

2975
02:46:38.08 --> 02:46:46.24
These are our platforms to connect the vets that have experience leading with companies

2976
02:46:46.24 --> 02:46:48.08
that need experienced leaders.

2977
02:46:48.08 --> 02:46:50.56
Go check out those platforms.

2978
02:46:50.56 --> 02:46:57.84
Also wanted to say, talking to Ike, asking him about any charities he wanted me to mention

2979
02:46:57.84 --> 02:47:03.52
and he said the Semper Fife fund, which does a bunch of stuff for Marines, for Marine families,

2980
02:47:03.52 --> 02:47:09.20
for Marines that are transitioning outside of the Marine Corps and also helps them out

2981
02:47:09.20 --> 02:47:11.24
with their health and wellness.

2982
02:47:11.24 --> 02:47:18.20
So that's Semper Fife fund.org and also you want to do check out the Fisher House, which

2983
02:47:18.20 --> 02:47:24.52
is when troops get wounded and they're in the hospital for an extended period of time.

2984
02:47:24.52 --> 02:47:27.84
The Fisher House provides them with a place to stick.

2985
02:47:27.84 --> 02:47:33.68
That provides their families with a place to stay in the area so it's Fisher House.org.

2986
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:37.68
It's both these organizations are great organizations to check those out.

2987
02:47:37.68 --> 02:47:44.08
And if you feel like you want to hear more from ECHO and I, you know, for whatever reason,

2988
02:47:44.08 --> 02:47:50.08
if you want to throw a correction notice that we made a mistake, which is entirely possible,

2989
02:47:50.08 --> 02:47:51.88
we probably need it.

2990
02:47:51.88 --> 02:47:56.08
Well we're there, we're on the interwebs.

2991
02:47:56.08 --> 02:48:06.24
And we're also on Twitter, we're on Instagram and we are on ZFrosion Book.

2992
02:48:06.24 --> 02:48:12.000
And you can find ECHO at ECHO Charles and I am at Jocka Willink.

2993
02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:23.64
Thanks once again to Charles Robert, Bobby Bob, Eisenbach, Ike, an absolute honor to me

2994
02:48:23.64 --> 02:48:30.48
with him today to talk to him and to hear his incredible story of service to America and

2995
02:48:30.48 --> 02:48:36.68
the rest of the veterans out there that are on active duty.

2996
02:48:36.68 --> 02:48:40.52
The ones that have already retired that've left the service, all of you that have put

2997
02:48:40.52 --> 02:48:41.52
on the uniform.

2998
02:48:41.52 --> 02:48:43.04
Thank you for your service.

2999
02:48:43.04 --> 02:48:46.64
And of course, the same goes out to our police and law enforcement and firefighters

3000
02:48:46.64 --> 02:48:51.28
and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret

3001
02:48:51.28 --> 02:48:58.92
service, you take care of us here on the home front and you are appreciated as well and

3002
02:48:58.92 --> 02:49:01.44
to both those groups.

3003
02:49:01.44 --> 02:49:08.12
Thanks to your families for the support that you give to the folks that are wearing the

3004
02:49:08.12 --> 02:49:10.12
uniform.

3005
02:49:10.12 --> 02:49:20.32
And everyone else out there, you know when you think about when you think about the challenges

3006
02:49:20.32 --> 02:49:26.04
that you face that I face that we all face, what challenges are we up against?

3007
02:49:26.04 --> 02:49:31.04
What external power is trying to hold you down?

3008
02:49:31.04 --> 02:49:36.92
Go into your little battle, your little battle in the world.

3009
02:49:36.92 --> 02:49:47.76
And then if you can, you can remember someone like Ike and you can remember what he did

3010
02:49:47.76 --> 02:49:58.36
facing these challenges shot in the head wounded, paralyzed, hospitalized.

3011
02:49:58.36 --> 02:49:59.44
And you know what?

3012
02:49:59.44 --> 02:50:06.16
Anyone of us can fold under those challenges of life.

3013
02:50:06.16 --> 02:50:14.40
You can do that, you can fold, you can give it or you can do what Ike did.

3014
02:50:14.40 --> 02:50:19.88
And what Ike does every day which is take on those challenges by getting out there and

3015
02:50:19.88 --> 02:50:23.04
getting after it.

3016
02:50:23.04 --> 02:50:30.08
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

3017
02:50:30.08 --> 02:50:50.26
texture
