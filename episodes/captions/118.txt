[00:00:00] This is Jocopotcast number 18.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:12] I need a mission.
[00:00:16] We all need a mission.
[00:00:20] That's what life should be is a mission.
[00:00:24] That's what gives your life, purpose and focus and drive and ultimately
[00:00:34] satisfaction.
[00:00:37] Now, that mission can be the job you work at.
[00:00:42] It can be providing for your family or it can be getting better at you,
[00:00:46] Jitsu or stronger at Olympic lifting or starting a business that you want to grow and
[00:00:52] build and take over the world.
[00:00:57] And sometimes people ask me what to do if they don't know what their mission is
[00:01:02] or what their mission should be.
[00:01:07] And I tell them if they're in that situation to go help someone.
[00:01:14] Go help someone else make that your mission.
[00:01:17] Because that will make you better.
[00:01:19] And it'll make the world better.
[00:01:23] And eventually from that, you'll see what your mission is.
[00:01:30] Now, I was lucky.
[00:01:35] Because from a young age, I had a mission.
[00:01:41] I wanted to be some kind of commando.
[00:01:44] And eventually I ended up pairing about the seal teams and decided that that was
[00:01:53] the best place for me.
[00:01:57] And that's where I went.
[00:02:00] And once I got to the seal teams, I had a new mission.
[00:02:05] Which was to prepare for war and that's what we did.
[00:02:08] And then eventually war came.
[00:02:18] And then that was the mission to take the fight to the enemy, to close with and destroy them
[00:02:25] through close combat.
[00:02:27] And that's what we did.
[00:02:28] But eventually for me and for everyone in the military, it ends.
[00:02:45] Maybe because of retirement or maybe because of family obligations or maybe
[00:02:50] for medical reasons, but for every warrior eventually the war ends.
[00:03:00] And that career ends and that mission ends.
[00:03:06] And I've talked a lot on this podcast about how important it is to find a new mission.
[00:03:12] Once the war is over for you and you've done your part, you have to find a new mission.
[00:03:26] Well, tonight we have a guest on who pursued much the same mission as me
[00:03:34] for as long as he could and who has now found a new mission that he is on.
[00:03:45] So Dan Crenshaw, welcome to the podcast.
[00:03:50] Thanks, Jack Oates, pleasure to be here with you.
[00:03:52] We're a lot of thanks for coming on.
[00:03:55] And let's just start at the beginning a little bit for people that don't know who you are.
[00:04:01] Let's talk a little bit about, I guess we'll talk about Katie Texas and at the same time,
[00:04:07] also include Ecuador and Colombia about your childhood.
[00:04:12] Absolutely.
[00:04:14] Well, like you said, I grew up in Katie Texas.
[00:04:17] I've had six generations of Texan flowing through me, my dad's side of the family.
[00:04:23] And my dad was in the oil and gas industry our whole lives.
[00:04:26] So when you hear the things about Ecuador and Colombia and even Egypt and Scotland, that's
[00:04:32] those are all the places we lived over the years because of his career.
[00:04:38] Everybody in the oil and gas industry in Texas knows that.
[00:04:41] It's a pretty common theme.
[00:04:44] I like to talk about some of the challenges that I went through from an early age.
[00:04:49] And what drove me, maybe drove my that that passed that mental capacity that you need
[00:04:56] to become a seal.
[00:04:57] And that started with my mother and my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer and I was five
[00:05:04] years old and she fought it hard for five years and she never quit, she never complained.
[00:05:10] I never saw it and if she did, I never saw it and she just took care of me and my brother.
[00:05:16] Every day, right up until the end.
[00:05:19] And she eventually lost that battle when I was 10 years old, 1994.
[00:05:23] But she instilled in me, you know, what I think are American and Texas values of integrity,
[00:05:32] respect and just never quit, never quit no matter what and don't feel sorry for yourself.
[00:05:40] Because she never did, she truly never did.
[00:05:42] And she asked where she told me before she died that I would sort of great heights.
[00:05:48] And I don't know what that meant at the time.
[00:05:49] But I think we know now. And not long after that, you know, when I could start reading books
[00:05:56] and and grab the first Navy seal, Dick Marcinto novel, Rogue Warrior,
[00:06:04] that I could your book wasn't out yet.
[00:06:06] Draco otherwise.
[00:06:07] Maybe I'll.
[00:06:08] Yeah, Rogue Warrior that that that came out when I was already in.
[00:06:12] Yeah, and the matter fact, it came out right as I showed up at the teams.
[00:06:16] It I'm pretty sure that's right when it came out. And obviously it created some turmoil in the
[00:06:22] teams, but it was pretty interesting, especially because I knew guys that had work for Dick Marcinto.
[00:06:27] And that was pretty interesting to talk to them. And to be totally frank with you, most of the
[00:06:33] guys that worked for Dick Marcinto loved him. And as a matter fact, one of the couple of the guys
[00:06:39] that I respect, I met, there's one guy as a matter fact that that I work for.
[00:06:44] And this was a couple years later. It's a matter fact it was around 1994, because I was in a
[00:06:49] seal puto and I was talking to this guy that had worked for Dick Marcinto. And I said,
[00:06:54] hey, you know how was Dick Marcinto? How was it to work for him?
[00:06:58] He looked at me as a best CEO ever. Yeah. And this was from a guy that I have utmost respect for.
[00:07:03] So I thought that was pretty cool. Even though, you know, his book, you know, the book is,
[00:07:08] it's, I'd say it's a Hollywood-ish book. Yeah. And, and, you know, the statement in there that
[00:07:14] everyone always laughs about in the teams is the statement that every seal on his team could bench
[00:07:19] press 500 pounds. Right. Right. The number came to growing. We're not going, we're not even going
[00:07:24] to make it real listening. We're not going to make it real listening. We're not going to make it real
[00:07:27] listening. We're just going straight to 500 pounds everyone on the team. Right. And that's just
[00:07:32] a patently untrue. And what sucks is when you do that with that thing, well, then people start
[00:07:38] looking at the book and go to what is true and what is not. Right. So, and although, from the way
[00:07:42] it's been described to me, the events in that book, a lot of them are compiled. So, like this little
[00:07:48] thing happened on a training event, this thing happened on a training event, this thing happened
[00:07:51] on a training event, but they'd all be compiled into one big story. And yeah. So it's kind of like a
[00:07:55] Hollywood. Yeah. It's a book. It's a nonfiction-ish story. 10-year-old bandcredsch, I didn't know that.
[00:08:02] You was like, I'm going to bench 500 pounds. No problem. Yeah. You know, I wouldn't be here without
[00:08:09] that series of books. Frankly, you know, I probably still have two eyes, but nobody's
[00:08:14] used to eyes. That's a luxury. We'll get to that in a little bit. So, yeah, I mean, that,
[00:08:22] you know, once you've once that and you know this, most seals operate this way, or at least they
[00:08:28] have the same story of, yeah, it was just from a young age. I had a mission. I knew what it was
[00:08:35] and every decision I made from, from then until the moment I got into Buds was just prepared for that.
[00:08:42] Now, when you, did you, I know you lived overseas? Where did you go to high school?
[00:08:48] So, most of high school in Colombia. Okay. Yeah. And, uh, did you play sports down there?
[00:08:52] I played soccer. Okay. Yeah. Because you were in Colombia. Yeah. So, you're in the place of
[00:08:55] kind of like what they had. You're in a place of soccer. It was that or volleyball.
[00:09:00] Yeah. It was like a play volleyball. And then, if you applied from college from Colombia,
[00:09:06] yeah. And okay, this is, this is kind of an important question because a lot of people
[00:09:10] asked me this question all the time. You were definitely wanted to be a seal. What made you make the
[00:09:14] decision between going to college and you ended up going to Tufts? Yeah. And then in most of
[00:09:20] in Massachusetts. So, at some point you said to yourself, okay, I could enlist tomorrow and go to
[00:09:27] boot camp and, you know, be a seal within the year. Or I can go to college for four years and, you know,
[00:09:36] then apply and I'll be in an, on officer in a leadership position. I could ask that question all
[00:09:41] time. For me, when I was 18 years old, the answer was real easy. Like, oh, I can be a seal within a year.
[00:09:48] Sign me up. Yeah. And, and that's what I did. And for you, you obviously took a different approach.
[00:09:54] And people asked me all the time, which one is better. And I, I tell them that there's advantages
[00:09:58] and disadvantages to both of them. But what made you decide you're going to go officer style from the
[00:10:02] get go? Maybe, you know, along with my mission of being a seal, my whole life,
[00:10:08] the similar mission of I wanted a college degree as well. I wanted to knock that out.
[00:10:14] And, and then, you know, I wasn't well informed enough to really speak about the
[00:10:19] difference between officer and enlisted back then. Like, I am now. But I did want a leadership role.
[00:10:24] It was important to me based on what I'd read and based on the movies I'd seen that I
[00:10:29] wasn't a leadership role. Did you see Navy seals? Was that obviously? That's like,
[00:10:34] if that's a late babbling's answer to why you came a seal straight up. Yeah. Yeah, totally seals,
[00:10:38] Charlie Sheen gets on it. Yeah. So, I bet I didn't just see it. You know, we had it on all the time.
[00:10:47] Okay, this movie ever. Yeah, you know, it's so a combination of wanting a leadership role.
[00:10:53] Maybe knowing to, you know, was I really ready at age 18? You know, I know I wanted it.
[00:10:59] But I have also, I also wanted to be prepared. Yeah. And it was able to think ahead enough to know
[00:11:04] that maybe I can't swim all that great just yet. We might need some more practice. Yeah.
[00:11:09] But it was mostly like, it was mostly, I'm going to go to college first. That's then my life path.
[00:11:16] That's what I'm going to do. And so that's what I did. And yeah, and then I bet Tufts University,
[00:11:22] mostly because of its international relations program. That was my focus. It was foreign affairs,
[00:11:28] international relations, politics, and I did a minor in physics just because why not? Yeah.
[00:11:35] Because that sounds like fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you, you speak Spanish obviously from growing up
[00:11:41] in Columbia too. So you are you fluent in Spanish? Pretty fluent. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:44] Yeah. Now it's got a little rusty, but we're, we can get. And you did ROTC at,
[00:11:48] yes, was there any seals there? Like prior seals that were instructors or anything like that?
[00:11:54] No. I, well, no, there was at Harvard. So a lot of these guys doing master's programs while we're
[00:12:00] doing ROTC. They're not attached to the unit, but I did have the opportunity to work with some guys.
[00:12:04] And you know, just get that mentorship. This is the kind of work out you might want to be doing.
[00:12:11] I mean, just the basics because you just have no idea. Yeah. I'm into it. Do you think
[00:12:15] kids over prepare for Buds now? I think it depends on the kid. I often mentor guys who want to go
[00:12:24] through and you know, that sometimes they do focus a little bit too much on, especially things
[00:12:29] they're good at. Yeah. Like I'm running 10 miles a day. It's going to like a five minute
[00:12:33] pace. Some like stop running. Never run again. Yeah. You're good at that. Move on to the next thing.
[00:12:39] You know, focus on your weaknesses. Guys just don't understand the little, little basics. I don't know
[00:12:43] if they over train. I haven't worked with enough to really know. I talked to people and they
[00:12:48] send me messages all the time and they're on this two year training program to get ready for Buds.
[00:12:55] And I'm like, hey, train for two months and then go, no, it's not that hard. If you played a
[00:13:01] sport in college or you played a sport in high school and you can run like you'll get in good
[00:13:06] shape there and it's going to be a challenge. But waiting around, especially when there's a war
[00:13:10] going on that you don't really want to miss. Yeah. Like that's a big deal to me. You know, and I tell
[00:13:14] these guys, this war's not going to last forever. And you know, I showed up at the team in 1991,
[00:13:20] just missed the first call for it. And it's, you know, I didn't shoot my weapon at the enemy for 13
[00:13:27] years. And that's a long, dry, hard 13 years. And so, yeah, you don't miss out on that. No, you don't.
[00:13:35] One of my old team guy buddies. It was like 1971 and and he, the V, thought the V at
[00:13:43] NOMOR was going to end and he's down at the Marine Corps recruiter saying, I want to be a door
[00:13:47] cutter, he we. It's interesting that there's, you know, you always hear about the protesters
[00:13:53] and whatnot. But there's kids that want to fight. Oh, yeah. We do have a, there's a warrior class
[00:14:02] in, in America that I think we should be proud of and it'd be proud to be a part of because
[00:14:06] it's a, for good people with good values and they want to do the right thing for the country.
[00:14:10] So you show up at butts. So you get to be good done with college, college is college, right?
[00:14:16] Is there anything particularly you want to say about college? No. Okay. Well, cool.
[00:14:20] Because I'll particularly want to hear about it.
[00:14:22] Yeah, college happened. Yeah, college happened. And so you show up at butts and any issues at butts?
[00:14:32] Yeah. You know, I started my, I started with class two, six, one. About Tuesday afternoon of my first
[00:14:39] hell week, my stress fracture developed into a pretty noticeable fracture. And I got the old
[00:14:46] question, are you hurt? Or are you injured, Mr. Crenshaw? And you really want to be injured because
[00:14:51] you better not just be hurt because then you're just quitting. And I was, I was injured.
[00:14:56] I was pretty substantially. I mean, you know, I mean, stress fractures are pretty normal,
[00:15:02] injury and, and buds. Okay. So you, so when I'm sitting there talking about people don't prep
[00:15:06] enough, you're like, actually, you should prep more. Do you think you could run more for pairing for
[00:15:10] butts? I would have, I ran plenty. I would have, I would have focused a little bit more on
[00:15:15] strength and conditioning. You know, something I just didn't know how to do back then. Because
[00:15:21] what happens in butts is, I mean, you're going to go to failure. You're going to go to failure
[00:15:25] no matter what. And it's going to happen on the hour, every hour, maybe every 10 minutes, all the time.
[00:15:30] So the guys who overprepared, they, they, they can't understand why they're failing so much.
[00:15:35] Right? And that, that messes with their heads. Maybe that's what you mean by overprepared.
[00:15:40] Because that's what I mean by. Like, I think, I think guys get too confident in their abilities.
[00:15:45] And they just don't understand why they're hitting a wall all the time. Whereas like,
[00:15:50] guys like me or just like, I just, I just, I expected to suck. So it's really not a surprise.
[00:15:55] Or just going to keep trying, no matter what. And just never quit. And an, an, an quitting is never an
[00:15:59] option. The other problem is if you overprepared, it, it, it may be it becomes an option. This isn't
[00:16:04] the case for everybody. But I see some of the best in shape guys quit because it was just,
[00:16:09] they were like, maybe it was an option for them. Like, maybe I'll make it, maybe I won't. But if you,
[00:16:13] you should never go into buds thinking that way. And that's why a lot of guys who make it through,
[00:16:19] I think have this story that, well, I wanted to do it since I was 10 years old. So it was just never an
[00:16:23] option for me to ever quit. So yeah, you do need to prepare enough to make sure your, your muscles
[00:16:29] when they do fail aren't putting all the strain on your joints and your knees. And that's what happened to me
[00:16:34] because it just happened over time and over time and you're limping a certain way. And that just
[00:16:39] causes a fracture eventually because there's too much pressure being put on your bones. So,
[00:16:43] you know, or I just had a week genetics. Yeah, it's like, one story. Or it'll likely, yeah, it's
[00:16:48] here. So I, it's like I rolled back. I came back again with 264. And you know, you know,
[00:16:53] there's the, that two mile run you're doing how weak it's like Tuesday or so, if how weak and it's a
[00:16:59] time, you went through a long time. Well, it's like a Tuesday or something. It's a time to run. And if you,
[00:17:04] and if you get in the top five, you don't have to do it again. And then everybody else has to do it all
[00:17:09] over again. And you get to rest under a boat and, you know, eat sand or whatever they let you do.
[00:17:15] Much on that sand over there. And you know, my first, how weak I was dead last. I mean, just
[00:17:22] way be like not even close, right? Because I was limping the whole time. And my second, how weak,
[00:17:27] I was, I was first placed by maybe five minutes, you know, and maybe because I knew what the
[00:17:32] game was, but everybody does actually, the work gets around. You know, it's, but it was, it was,
[00:17:38] it was a message, maybe to myself of like, we're gonna, we're gonna not only do this, but we're gonna
[00:17:44] crush it. And I'm gonna feel good about it. I'm gonna rest under that boat and eat my sand.
[00:17:49] Well, everybody else is running. At the, at the, at the, at the frankly, it was really cold. So I kind of
[00:17:53] wish I'd been running at the time. But whatever I want. The closest story I have to that is we got
[00:18:00] done with a four mile time run. And when we got done, the people that failed and I didn't fail,
[00:18:06] but there was a bunch of people that failed. And the instructor who is a really a perfect instructor
[00:18:13] meaning that his attitude and the way he cared himself was epic for Buds. And he was the senior chief of
[00:18:21] the phase, it was dive phase. And the guy's come across and he's collecting the guys that fail,
[00:18:26] which was probably at least half the class. And then you know, he says, you know, because I'm fair,
[00:18:32] I'm gonna go ahead and let you do this time run again. Get on the line, ready, go. And everyone
[00:18:36] had to run another four mile time run. Right. Well, not us, but the people that, the people that
[00:18:40] passed got to not know, but the people that didn't pass, which was half the class,
[00:18:44] had to go and just run another four mile time run right then to see if they could then pass it.
[00:18:48] Yeah, but she's going to pass. You have to put out as hard as you possibly could for a
[00:18:57] four mile time run, which I actually had to do every time. I failed to run and I failed one run
[00:19:01] in Buds. I I paced myself. I said, oh, you know what, I'll just pace myself. I'm not going to put
[00:19:06] out as hard as I as a kind. I'll save a little bit for later. And that didn't work. I failed,
[00:19:11] because I'm not a fast runner. And so from then on, it was just a sprint as hard as I could go
[00:19:15] for the whole damn time. Unlike you, I didn't win any races, good buds. So you get done with
[00:19:24] and you show up. So now it's 2000 what year is it? This is 2007. Okay. Yeah, 2007. Yeah,
[00:19:32] finishing Buds 2007 in the moving NSQT. That's right. Life Babin, putting me through
[00:19:37] Jatsi. Nice. You know, I was I was I was I was indoctrinated early on. Yeah. Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:19:48] And then from there, you rolled to Team 3, Team 3. I was Team 3 with Felusion 2008 and then
[00:19:55] back in Mormati in 2010 with try to put in, you know, you're a little true. You know, going back
[00:20:01] to late for running that course. It was interesting because what that course used to be was almost
[00:20:06] like an administrator course. Hey, here's how you write e-viles and they had a little tiny bit of
[00:20:11] dashings of of tactics in it, but it was here's how you write e-viles. Here's how you write
[00:20:17] navy messages and just that kind of stuff. Yeah. And you know, we knew that these kids needed to
[00:20:23] train because in Ramaadiah had guys that were first platoon, guys out ground force commanders. Yeah.
[00:20:28] And we wanted to make sure these guys knew what to do on the battlefield and it was awesome
[00:20:33] that life went there and started rehashing that program and did a great job because it was very
[00:20:37] valuable. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah. So then you got done with that. Then you showed up at Team 3.
[00:20:44] And you went right on deployment. Right. I mean, Team 3 was already on deployment. So they just
[00:20:49] deployed, you know, and you know how that goes. It's the cycle of graduates. So we met up with Team 3.
[00:20:55] I was in Felusion for a little while. I was down in Bosor for a few months and actually stayed
[00:21:00] on deployment to meet up with Team 5 and and help them transition, you know, as we were setting
[00:21:07] up another debt out there in Bosor. Great, great first deployment and learned a lot.
[00:21:14] Got to work a little bit and then came back to Iraq in 2010. And another great deployment for me
[00:21:21] because I was able to take over a Splatoon Commander when my platoon OIC had to go to
[00:21:26] relieve another platoon OIC. So, you know, we were going through the entire targeting cycle,
[00:21:32] working with multiple Iraqi partners throughout Ramad, and throughout all of Alambar. We got to
[00:21:37] operate throughout the entire province, even a little bit in Baghdad. So just an amazing experience
[00:21:43] for a young J.O. who wouldn't normally be putting that position and working with some of the best
[00:21:48] people I've ever met. You know, we talked about before. I won't name names on the podcast. But,
[00:21:54] you know, well, your OIC was a great guy that got moved. That's why he got moved. And obviously,
[00:21:58] they had confidence in you to to move you up into the platoon commander position, which is an
[00:22:04] interesting thing. I had a group of business people and they, there was a guy that kept saying,
[00:22:11] well, no one can take my place, you know, and then he was surprised that he wasn't getting promoted.
[00:22:16] And, you know, explained to people, if you don't have a person below you in the chain of command,
[00:22:22] or two or three people below you in the chain of command, that can take your job. Well, then you're
[00:22:25] going to have to stay in your job and you're not going to get promoted. So that's proof that your OIC,
[00:22:31] like I said, who's a great guy actually, he's supposed to come on the podcast at some point. But he's a
[00:22:35] great guy and he had groomed you and taught you everything he could do and made you ready and trusted
[00:22:43] you to say when the boss came to him and said, hey, I got a fire guy. I'm going to move you
[00:22:47] over to Afghanistan is your A OIC ready to take over and he could confidently say, yes, he is. And that's
[00:22:53] that's awesome. And that shows that he was a great leader to to kind of prepare you properly for that
[00:23:01] situation. That's a good point. I mean, that is part of leadership and management. It's making sure that
[00:23:05] below you and above you is squared away. Yeah, but I would put it. And I would do that when I was
[00:23:11] running training, I would always kill theoretically or what is it virtually kill the two or
[00:23:18] many years. You all of us. Yeah, and sometimes I'd kill all of you. Yeah, I remember.
[00:23:24] Yeah, there'd be some some some buddy carries happening for extended distances. Yeah, I was a little bit
[00:23:33] I was a little bit crazy at that point. And you know, I was a good training. Yeah, yeah,
[00:23:38] you know, it's I was coming home from Ramadi and I wanted to make sure you guys were ready to
[00:23:43] ready for the worst possible case scenarios, you know. So then you get so you do that,
[00:23:50] you finish out that deployment. That was a solid deployment. You were running a bunch of stuff.
[00:23:54] That sounds like a good deal. And then what did you do when you came back? So it came back
[00:23:59] moved over to support activity one. And as you know, they run intelligence support operations
[00:24:05] for the seal teams. It's a fairly normal transition to make as an officer. And for a lot of
[00:24:11] this guys too. But with that ended up what really, what that translated into is back on deployment
[00:24:16] 2012 with my platoon again, seal team three, trial of the platoon, and can do hard province. So
[00:24:23] on that deployment, this was one of our more kinetic deployments. I mean, it's Afghanistan,
[00:24:28] it's can do hard, there's IEDs everywhere. I mean, everywhere. I mean to the point where, you know,
[00:24:34] our TTPs or, you know, our, our, our, our, our HIPs. So these are our standard operating procedures.
[00:24:40] We're, hey, we're on patrol. We're getting shot at. Don't even move. Don't even go, look for cover.
[00:24:45] Because as soon as you move, you hit an IED. I mean, they're, they're just, they're that
[00:24:50] prevalent throughout the entire ground, not just on pathways, not just in doorways, in the most
[00:24:55] random of places. These guys are just burying these things at a whim, you know. And then it's,
[00:25:01] but it's chaos out there. And we know they're not that great at shooting at us. So would rather just take it.
[00:25:06] So I'm going to take a moment just to emphasize what you just said, because it's really important
[00:25:11] and not everyone will understand it the way you, the way you, uh, went over it quickly, almost from
[00:25:16] a tactical mindset. So I just want everyone to understand what he's, what he's saying is when at this
[00:25:21] point, the IEDs were so bad that if you started getting shot at by the enemy, the obvious and
[00:25:30] common and practice that everyone in the world instinctively and by training has is you immediately
[00:25:37] hit the ground and seek cover. And you get behind a log, you get behind a piece of terrain, you find
[00:25:42] somewhere to hide from the bullets that are coming at you. And what Dan saying is during this deployment,
[00:25:48] the IED threat was so high that when the enemy started shooting at them, instead of finding
[00:25:53] cover to hide from the bullets, they would rather just stay put, probably take a knee, but not
[00:26:00] dive behind something because they likely, there was a likely chance that there was an IED there.
[00:26:05] Yep, that's that's crazy. It is. You know, we've, we've seen multiple guys get, get blown up
[00:26:13] and usually our partners, our Afghan partners who are patrolling with us, because, you know,
[00:26:19] maybe they're, they're just not as careful or maybe the equipment they're using to detect IEDs in
[00:26:25] the ground, they weren't using it properly, whatever the case may be, or maybe just because it's
[00:26:28] bad luck and they're just everywhere. You know, it's, and there's more, you had more Afghan
[00:26:34] partners than Americans. Oh, by far, we would sometimes go in operations with about 100
[00:26:39] Afghans and maybe 12, 15 seals. Yeah, because that we're doing entire clearance operations
[00:26:45] through villages, you know, where we're going house to house, or shaken hands, a little bit of
[00:26:50] shaken hands, it's a little bit of on security, you know, either defending ourselves or going on
[00:26:55] the offensive, it depends on the situation, but, you know, we round everybody up, we talked to them,
[00:27:01] you know, we meet with village elders, so it's, it's, it's, it's a little bit of your,
[00:27:06] your, I guess, your more typical and conventional warfare tactics, so we're trying to meet and
[00:27:11] greet the population while also, you know, being prepared for battle. And, and, but the hardest
[00:27:19] part of that was certainly the IED threat, you know, only single file lines, everything we ever learned
[00:27:23] and training of different formations and, you know, staggered, actual on whatever it is, it doesn't
[00:27:31] apply. It all, it all gets thrown out the window, because it's, it's only about single file,
[00:27:36] what has been cleared, what hasn't been cleared, and you could, you could, you could
[00:27:39] veer from that a little bit depending on what area you're in and can to harm, more mountainous
[00:27:43] areas, less IEDs, but even then, I've got a story, you know, these guys, some of our guys take a,
[00:27:49] take a point, take a, on the high ground, then a little hilltop, I mean, just in the middle of nowhere,
[00:27:55] I mean, middle of, no, I can't emphasize this enough, it is the middle of nowhere, right, and they
[00:28:00] sit down and this pop goes off, it was a blasting cap that went low order, which means it didn't
[00:28:06] blow up the main charge, like a 15, 20 pound charge, it would have killed all three of them right
[00:28:11] then and there, and I mean, I want to say that again, middle of nowhere, there was no reason for
[00:28:16] there to the IED right there, but there was, this was out in the mountains, and this wasn't even
[00:28:21] in the, you know, the southern Canterhard district, which is, which is truly just a minefield everywhere,
[00:28:27] you know, so, you know, the Canterna emphasized how bad the threat is there, and even even
[00:28:32] taking, even taking a small high ground position behind a rock, you know, this is what the kind
[00:28:38] of things we ran into, and so that was that deployment, it was a lot of fun, but it was, it was a
[00:28:46] hard one for us, you know, on month six, that's six months since June 15th, 2012, I was hit by an IED
[00:28:56] blast by one of these, you know, again, there everywhere, it was, it was the one day we spent in
[00:29:01] Helman Province, so we went to Helman on an, on an elastment admission to support some marine
[00:29:07] special operations forces out there, and as, as the early, you know, we always fly in about the
[00:29:14] middle of the night, we do that so that the enemy can't arm the IED, so the IEDs are everywhere,
[00:29:19] but they're not always armed, and if they, if they keep them armed, they run out of batteries,
[00:29:24] and they don't work anymore, so they, so there's, there's a little bit of tactical consideration there,
[00:29:29] but, you know, and as the early morning hours come and the daylight starts to hit, we start to move
[00:29:36] around, and we start to clear out this one compound, and hadn't been totally clear jet, and one
[00:29:42] of my Afghan interpreters was responding to a call, runs in front of me, and completely gets
[00:29:49] dismembered by about 15 pounds of explosives underneath them, and all I know is I got hit with
[00:29:54] something, and it feels like you get hit by a truck wall, a bunch of guys in the truck are shooting
[00:30:00] you with a shotgun, that's sort of what it feels like, and, you know, my immediate reaction was
[00:30:07] feel my legs, right, so I, I feel my legs and everything's still there, you know, I know
[00:30:13] something is wrong. Distance from the IED, a couple feet, I mean it's so, I mean, because
[00:30:18] I would, I would, I'd lia, a few feet, what were you and me are probably, is about, you know, just
[00:30:24] across the table, and, you know, lots of pain, pain everywhere, but not my eyes, so I was completely
[00:30:31] blinded, but, you know, totally under the assumption that I just had dirt in my eyes, and,
[00:30:36] I remained under this assumption that there was really nothing wrong with my eyes for, frankly,
[00:30:41] for weeks to come, and we'll talk about that, but, you know, I was, I, I didn't lose consciousness,
[00:30:47] and knew what was happening, I could hear the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:30:50] everybody thinks that when somebody gets their legs blown off their screaming like the movies,
[00:30:54] it's just never the case, it's a very different, like, visceral sound of pain,
[00:30:59] and it's, and I've heard it many times now, because, you know, this, this happened to
[00:31:04] us a couple times, and, um, so I heard that, I knew, I knew that rockmon had been hit,
[00:31:10] because I could hear him, and, um, you know, one of our, one of my teammates tells a story where
[00:31:15] he, he got hit with a, with a foot, and a building next door, I mean, and it was, and that's how they
[00:31:22] knew something had gone terribly wrong, and, uh, you know, the medics come to me, there's nothing
[00:31:28] they can do for me, they, they sort of just wrap up my eyes, they know something's wrong, I really
[00:31:33] don't, frankly, I just, I keep assuming there's just dirt in my eyes, and that'll be fine,
[00:31:38] and, uh, eventually, we get taken out of there, and I was able to get up and walk to the
[00:31:43] heel, because, you know, you know, let somebody carry it when they've got a firefight to finish,
[00:31:48] and we get on, and, uh, as soon as the medics on the helicopter see me, they, they put me out right
[00:31:53] away, and I don't wake up for days. So, when I do wake up, um, in Germany, they, they told me my
[00:32:00] ride-eye had been removed, and, uh, I'd probably never see again on my left eye, but there's a chance,
[00:32:06] and again, kind of self-deception kicks in, I'm like, so you're saying there's a chance,
[00:32:09] we'll be fine. Just get the surgery done, get me on a plane to, to back to Maryland, the
[00:32:16] Walter Reed Ospo, where these surgeons are, and let's do this, and they're like, it's going to be a
[00:32:20] day or two, I argue, we argue, you know, that, that's how it goes for the next couple of days. I can't really
[00:32:25] move, I can't get up to use the bathroom, my body is completely swollen and, and, and, and,
[00:32:31] and shredded, really, I mean, there's no real permanent injuries to the rest of my body, but it's,
[00:32:36] it's in such a state that, like, I just just shockwave from the blast. I think shock, and I was,
[00:32:42] I had a ton of shrapnel just throughout. I think I was swollen, um, might have been muscle
[00:32:47] atrophy from being, you know, medically induced coma for so long, because I've been there,
[00:32:51] been that way for five or six days, but really couldn't move, um, and just wrapped up really tight,
[00:32:58] because I mean, as you can see the scarring a little bit, um, I was just, it was kind of been
[00:33:04] through a meat grinder a little bit, and, um, I was also, I was hallucinating wildly, so,
[00:33:10] I, everything I saw was Afghanistan. I was lucid, I understood what was around me, but all I could
[00:33:16] see was an Afghan guy sitting next to me, or an Afghan village. It was, it's, it's almost like
[00:33:22] Phantom Pain, but with your eyes, and there's a medical term for it that I can't remember,
[00:33:26] um, but it was, it just an odd and terrifying experience, because it wasn't, I knew it wasn't
[00:33:35] real, but it's just everything I saw. And, um, eventually got back to Maryland, um, on a,
[00:33:42] on one of our medical flights, and, you know, my wife was there waiting for me, and, you know,
[00:33:48] we began how that conversation about, okay, what's the next surgery? Because I had to remove the
[00:33:51] cataract. I mean, that was, that was the issue. There was a lot of shrapnel in my left eye,
[00:33:55] the eye that was still there, and, you know, the issue was, could we, can we safely remove the
[00:34:01] cataract, and will he ever see again? And if you do, if we do do that, what's, what are his
[00:34:05] chances really, of having decent vision? And, um, you know, we, we prayed, and we, I, and I look back
[00:34:13] on it, and, and again, that, you know, we call itself deception, but it was really the strength to
[00:34:18] stay sane, and, and, and believe that I was actually going to see again, and, and I truly
[00:34:24] believe that was God's strength is working through me, it was allowing me to, to believe in
[00:34:29] something impossible, um, because otherwise I would have gone nuts, because people sometimes ask me,
[00:34:33] what's it like not knowing if you're ever going to see again? And I always answer, I, I don't know.
[00:34:39] I don't know what that's like, because it was never, that was never my mental state. My mental
[00:34:43] state was always, it'll happen, it's just a matter of time, and then I can finally get back to my
[00:34:48] mental state. You know, the issue for me was like, when are we going to do this? You guys told me six weeks, all right, let's
[00:34:53] schedule it. And, you know, it was insanity. Yeah, I mean, that's obviously when I hear this story,
[00:35:00] I think Orion Joe who's with me in reminding you, and he got shot in the face, and, you know,
[00:35:06] it was a similar situation where, you know, clearly his, his eye, one eye was gone, but his
[00:35:13] other eye appeared to be intact, and he could actually see after he got wounded, then he got put into a,
[00:35:21] you know, he could see what was happening and, and walked into the Kazovak vehicle, but,
[00:35:29] you know, they put him into a medically induced coma, and when he woke up, he couldn't see.
[00:35:33] And then it was the same type of thing that they were telling you, they were telling him,
[00:35:39] which is, look, there was some nerve damage, we're not sure, and his attitude was very similar
[00:35:45] of like, well, it'll be okay, and, you know, it'll come back, but, you know, what didn't take
[00:35:51] very long before the doctors were like, no, it's, it's not coming back. And I forget the timeline,
[00:35:59] you know, I forget the timeline, because it's kind of a, kind of a blur together.
[00:36:05] But, yeah, for him, it was, he had a great attitude, but, you know, at the end,
[00:36:15] didn't happen. And, you know, and that's a guy that was still like, and he also still wanted to come back
[00:36:22] and get back with his platoon, and was telling me, you know, don't worry, I can smell the enemy,
[00:36:27] and I'll know where to shoot. Let me back, sir. So, yeah, the fact that you were able to recover is
[00:36:36] awesome, awesome, and, you know, it's, it shows, it should show people that, you know, even though
[00:36:44] you had a great attitude, the threat of, of never being able to see again was very, very real, very,
[00:36:51] very, very real. Oh, yeah, and it truly was, I mean, we had miracles occur in the operating room,
[00:36:56] multiple occasions, and doctors were just amazed that not only could I see again, but see well again.
[00:37:03] It was, because they're in their minds, they're like, well, if we do this surgery and his retina
[00:37:08] doesn't detach, like we think it might, he'll still have, you know, crappy vision, you know,
[00:37:14] because his corny is all destroyed. I mean, everything's a mess in this eye, and, you know, we'll
[00:37:19] get him some decent glasses so we can kind of live his life, but he's, he's pretty much permanently
[00:37:23] disabled, and I just didn't listen, I don't even remember these conversations, like I think I
[00:37:28] blocked him out, and, you know, it's, because the first surgery was, we've got to remove the
[00:37:32] cataract, okay, that went well, all right, we removed the cataract great, you know, and the next step
[00:37:37] is to put a lens in plants, in your eye, like, like anybody normally would, when they have
[00:37:41] cataract surgery, that's just the normal thing to do. We ended up never doing that, because it's
[00:37:46] kind of like replacing a window pane on a normal eye, but if the frame of the window is completely
[00:37:51] destroyed, then you have to sew the window pane to curtains, and that's never a good policy.
[00:37:55] So, they eventually refuse to do that on me, even though I was demanding it constantly,
[00:38:01] but because I wanted to see again, I wanted to get back, and I don't want to have a big
[00:38:04] thick glasses, which is what I have to wear now, or this specialized contact, but then another
[00:38:10] problem occurred, which is a whole, in my retina, that was expanding. And again, it's kind of a normal,
[00:38:16] you know, if you're over 50, this might be a normal thing that occurs, and then you have a pretty
[00:38:22] routine surgery to get rid of it and to stop it, but for me, it was incredibly fragile,
[00:38:27] but we had to do it. So I went blind again for six weeks, recovering from this surgery, so
[00:38:32] and I was truly living in darkness for a long time. You know, and not always, I think God
[00:38:37] wasn't hallucinating the entire time, that stopped after about week one, just or just after my major
[00:38:44] surgery, my first major surgery, but I won't blind again. And another miracle happened because
[00:38:50] they truly thought I wasn't going to make it through that surgery either. So, after, when they,
[00:38:54] when you were blind again for six weeks, going into that, did they tell you, okay, you're going to
[00:38:59] be blind for a period of time, and take time for you? Yeah, just because of the recovery process,
[00:39:03] you, they put a gas bubble in your eye so that it puts pressure on the back of your retina,
[00:39:08] and you have to be faced down for six weeks. It's just the weirdest. What the hell did you do for six
[00:39:13] weeks? Like, it's down. I bet. I got one of those massage chairs. Uh-huh. We're, you know,
[00:39:18] you plant your face down. I had audio books going all day long. It was great. Yeah, and by great,
[00:39:25] I mean, not great at all. Yeah, by great, you mean awesome. Yeah, yeah, start sucks and
[00:39:35] I'm sure you, you, you had to stay faced down all the time. Are you, um, and that six
[00:39:39] weeks goes by, and then they eventually remove the gas bubble and dissipates. Yeah, so there's
[00:39:44] eventually a point where you're like, okay, it's gone now. I can, I'm allowed, I'm allowed to look
[00:39:48] straight again. And then, and then it's just, you know, refitting your eye with the right eye
[00:39:53] wearing, you know, like, glasses and contacts, so I can actually get back to normal life and
[00:39:57] in frankly, that took years. Uh, it, you know, it's, eventually, I'll just, I'll skip to the end.
[00:40:04] About two and a half years in, I finally got, got a referred by the Navy to an outside clinic that
[00:40:11] does these, these amazing contacts, um, there's only one company in the world that does it. And I
[00:40:17] can see 2020 with it. Now, not up close, you know, my vision's complicated because I have a
[00:40:21] cataract, but, but I actually see 2020 vision at distance, which is, I mean, just not even close to
[00:40:28] what they thought was possible. So, um, and, and despite all that, I mean, I, before that two and a half
[00:40:33] year mark, I still had decent enough contacts to survive. I mean, they just weren't comfortable,
[00:40:37] they've kind of drove me crazy. And, um, you know, well, I cared about was getting back to the team.
[00:40:42] I was almost going back to Team 3. The, uh, the command wouldn't let that happen in the end.
[00:40:47] There's because I couldn't get the medical waiver to do it. So, I stayed at what was now
[00:40:52] called Special Reconnaissance Team 1. Again, we do Intel support for the SEAL teams,
[00:40:56] and, uh, did the troop commander there. So, in charge of about 50 personnel, mix of seals,
[00:41:02] intelligence specialists, um, all sorts of, uh, really great people that, you know, as you know,
[00:41:07] support the teams and intelligence matters. And, the point to Bahrain, uh, worked with
[00:41:13] joint special operations task force out there, um, working, you know, all throughout the
[00:41:18] Persian Gulf, uh, working on classified programs there, working in Lebanon as well, and, uh,
[00:41:24] coming back from that, uh, told I had to eventually get out. I mean, I had to start the medical
[00:41:31] retirement process. But before, before I did, I, I truly, I wanted to serve again. I mean, it was,
[00:41:37] it was extremely important to me. So, this deployment to Bahrain was about 2014. By the time I was
[00:41:42] really told, I had to medically retire. It was around 2016. But, you know, this process takes up to a year.
[00:41:48] And I asked that I, you know, be able to serve again in some capacity. Let my, let my, the specialties
[00:41:53] that I'd, that I'd acquired over the years at SRT1, be put to use in the Pacific, so they'd
[00:42:01] deploy me to Korea for my last deployment at the end of 2016. And as soon as I got home from that,
[00:42:06] I was, I was medically retired and, uh, had to find my next mission. You know, like you, you talked
[00:42:10] about the, the earlier on of the podcast. I mean, it's, it life truly is about mission. And,
[00:42:17] you know, I'm getting to politics now running for Congress and in Houston, Texas for the
[00:42:22] second district. And I, I talk about this a lot and from a, from a political philosophy standpoint,
[00:42:29] if you don't give people a mission or you don't encourage people to find their purpose and their
[00:42:34] dignity, you, you have a failing society. Uh, it's so important. And you're not, you know, even,
[00:42:41] even think tanks talk about this like American enterprise institute. Like our policies need to promote
[00:42:47] a sense of mission for people. And help people understand that they have value in this world. They're
[00:42:51] here on this earth for a reason. And if you're not constantly seeking out what that value is that you
[00:42:56] contribute to society, you're not doing your job. And we need to help you do your job if, if, if, if
[00:43:02] need be, but you, but you do have value and you, and you, and you must find that purpose in life.
[00:43:07] Um, and, and guys like us, I think can't survive without that constant mission. And, uh,
[00:43:14] well, we see it all the time with, with all vets when they, and I, I talk about this all the time.
[00:43:18] The vets that get out that have a note, a new, another mission. They focus on that mission. And they
[00:43:23] go kick ass. The vets that get out and don't know what they're going to do that flounder around
[00:43:28] without a direction. Those are the guys that end up in trouble because they don't have a mission.
[00:43:33] So they go and drink a beer, then they have another beer. And then the, they could get prescribed
[00:43:38] pain medicine for their back, which hurts, which sucks. And, and they go down this bad road.
[00:43:43] And I believe a lot of it is because, you know, they just need that next mission. But you got done with,
[00:43:50] so 2016, you didn't roll right into politics. You rolled to, you went back to college.
[00:43:56] Right. So no, in such an politics. And that become 2016. Did that become, you, you looked at
[00:44:01] what you're going to do next and you said, okay, well, how else can I serve, how else can I move forward?
[00:44:06] What's my next mission going to be in you decide you're going to go back to school?
[00:44:09] Back to school for, I knew it was going to stay in public service. So I knew my next mission was
[00:44:14] going to still be government. I wasn't exactly sure what. I knew I wanted to do, I wanted to
[00:44:19] be able to implement policy, strategy, and take that tactical experience. Because I had, you know,
[00:44:25] because I built an understanding of what policy and D.C. looks like on the ground.
[00:44:31] And actually because the reason I was hurt that day in 2012 was because of an Obama
[00:44:37] administration's policy of always wanting boots on the ground, battle of damage assessments for
[00:44:44] any, any close air support. So because earlier in that day, Marines had called in close air
[00:44:49] support on a compound that were taking fire from. For some reason, they wanted guys to walk
[00:44:53] across mine fields and go take pictures of it. Right. That's not good policy. Now, it's not a
[00:44:58] victimhood story. Don't get me wrong. I mean, there was a battle going on. We wanted to go. I don't
[00:45:02] care really what the reason is. But from a policy perspective, that's that's concerning. That,
[00:45:08] that kind of pressure is being put on our two star and our, and that's what drove that mission.
[00:45:14] That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So it's great to see somebody like General Madison
[00:45:18] right now who says the opposite. Well, I will not waste my troops time with these kind of things.
[00:45:22] And he's on record. You know, after we drop the mother of all bombs while back. So on record
[00:45:27] saying, I will not waste my troops time going to count the dead bodies out there. That's just
[00:45:30] good policy. So, you know, I wanted to take that experience to Washington. The National
[00:45:40] Next Step is get the right education. So the Harvard Kennedy School, government is where I
[00:45:44] went. Got a master's degree in public administration. Focus in more on national security issues,
[00:45:48] economic issues, and a little bit of political US politics. How long was that school?
[00:45:55] I just did a year when you're a program. And, you know, it was kind of the accelerated executive
[00:46:01] style program that you can apply to. If you're, if you're older and you actually have some,
[00:46:05] some life experience. What's the intensity level with that? Uh, it is tenses you make it. I took,
[00:46:11] I took about four extra credits more than I needed to. So I was busy. Because I, you know,
[00:46:17] it's, it's not like going to college where you're just getting through it. I think, uh,
[00:46:20] I would highly recommend anybody. You know, you do a master's degree later on in life. You're
[00:46:24] really going to get the most you can out of it. Because you care about learning you're there for a
[00:46:28] reason because you have purpose. And, and you know, why you're there. So I got a lot out of it,
[00:46:33] honestly. And it was, it was quite, it was really an amazing year. I mean, you hear from the greatest
[00:46:37] people. I, you know, Bush's Deputy National Security Advisor teaching us. Um, I had, uh,
[00:46:43] you know, the, the premier experts on counter proliferation policy, uh, teaching us in class. I had
[00:46:48] Reagan's chief economic advisor as my economics professor. I mean, you just can't, you know,
[00:46:54] these people don't speak in terms of like, this is what we think happens in the White House.
[00:46:58] Or no, they're like, when I was in the White House, this is how it got done. I mean, that's the kind of
[00:47:02] the level of instruction that you're getting. So I was really happy to, to, to get that education.
[00:47:08] And it, it, it's truly applies to it's as, in the, in my current role is as running for office.
[00:47:14] Um, I'm glad it was there. But what I hadn't necessarily thought about running for office,
[00:47:18] even after I graduated, uh, I was looking at more policy jobs, you know, because I didn't,
[00:47:23] I don't have the political connections. I don't have the background and money and the donor
[00:47:26] networks to really, to, to jump off on a campaign, uh, right away. We thought about it in the long-term
[00:47:32] sense, for sure, but, uh, but not in the short term. And, uh, I was working with Pete Sessions,
[00:47:38] Congressman Pete Sessions, and Capitol Hill for a while, getting legislative experience there.
[00:47:41] And, um, working doing some consulting, uh, and, uh, eventually came to a head where I was about
[00:47:50] taking a job, either doing counter-opens, a master's instruction policy for the Department of Defense,
[00:47:54] or go run for office because my Congressman Ted Poe had just announced retirement.
[00:47:59] And we prayed about it. We thought about it. We, uh, had the right backing from, you know, some
[00:48:06] well-connected people that I think God just put in front of us at the right time, and my wife and I
[00:48:12] went for it. You know, she was, uh, she was all in, who was all in, and, uh, and that was it. I mean,
[00:48:18] I've already, I've already, I've already come back to Texas by this point to the health with Hurricane
[00:48:22] Harvey reconstruction. It was out volunteer and we're, my whole hometown of Katie. My parents didn't
[00:48:27] flood. They were, they were, they've been living in spring, which is just North of Katie,
[00:48:31] from past 13, 14 years, but, you know, neighbors needed help. Neighbors still need help. Um, it's,
[00:48:37] it's still pretty devastated in Houston. And, you know, that, I think the decision became easy,
[00:48:43] that we knew this was the right choice. Like, this was the right mission. If I cared about
[00:48:47] nuclear proliferation policy, what better place to affect it from Congress,
[00:48:51] to care about helping flood victims, no better place than elected office. Um, if you care about
[00:48:56] border security, you know, which Texans do, no better place than public office. You know, if we
[00:49:00] care about protecting Americans and protecting the, you know, the, the sanctity of the seal teams and
[00:49:06] and pushing the right policies from the defense level, then, you know, elected politics is
[00:49:11] where do I can do it from? And, and so the decision was easy. It was, there's the right choice for us.
[00:49:17] We knew we were doing it for the right reasons. We know we are still doing it for the right reasons.
[00:49:21] And we're not going to quit. So with all those things that you said that are real positive about
[00:49:30] having a political career, you must have also been looking at the, the nightmare, gut check, just
[00:49:38] mud slinging that you're going to have to go, or that's going to be thrown at you and all that.
[00:49:43] And, and your family getting, the microscope on them and watched all the time and no privacy and
[00:49:48] all that, how did you weigh those things out? And did you think about those things as well?
[00:49:53] Absolutely. Uh, and it's, it's, by far the most concerning thing about politics. I mean, if anything
[00:50:00] drives, drives you out, it's, it's that, you know, and frankly, the experience has been too bad.
[00:50:06] Yeah, I mean, I get a tack for silly things here and there. I've got a, you know, one of, one of
[00:50:11] my opponents, what, what I would call one of his cronies, there's, there's, there's these corrupt, um,
[00:50:18] they call them the Slates in Harris County, which is Harris County is Houston. Um, and these
[00:50:25] three Slates are essentially three political maelors that go out and they, they, they target senior
[00:50:31] citizens especially. And they make it sound like there's these, these, these conservative review type of
[00:50:38] magazines, you know, these, something with authority behind it, but really they're not. Really
[00:50:42] they're paid a play and it's just one author and they pick who they like based on what kind of money
[00:50:47] they were able to get out of the deal and then they trash everybody else. So, you know, they put
[00:50:51] mine it, they put my bio on there, it doesn't say anything about who I actually am, it just says,
[00:50:55] I'm homeless and don't have a job and we're like to be, I mean, it's, it's absurd, right? And
[00:51:00] most people read it and they think this, this, this can't be serious. So, and actually got me a lot of
[00:51:05] votes because people would look me up after that and say, oh, well, this is, this is who this guy is.
[00:51:10] Maybe I will vote for him after all. But, but unfortunately that's politics and that's, that's
[00:51:14] the world we live in. Even though the, you know, the Harris County Republican Party has publicly
[00:51:19] denounced these so-called Slates because they send out these voter guides and, you know,
[00:51:24] they've denounced them but people don't always know. People aren't, you know, sometimes a lot of
[00:51:28] a folks still rely on those. So, that you're battling this kind of corruption, you're battling this
[00:51:32] establishment. I mean, you know, we always talk about the establishment in politics and I never
[00:51:36] really knew what that meant. I think until I saw behind the curtain and now I truly understand.
[00:51:41] And it's this class of politically connected people and the, and the donor class that really
[00:51:47] just stick together. And it's nothing to do with policy or doing the right thing for the American
[00:51:51] people. It's just how much money do you have? That's all that matters. And it's not, it's not all
[00:51:55] that matters. We made it into the runoff after last week's election, which was March 6. I was nine
[00:52:01] candidates in my primary and on an election day, I came out far and away first place. We've beat out
[00:52:10] overall in the election. I was second place but we beat out. So, just to again explain that a little bit,
[00:52:17] for people that aren't paying attention to election, you are in the, in the fight, you're going
[00:52:22] to get some nine other candidates going into the election. Obviously, there's some people that vote
[00:52:27] early through mail voting and they just vote early and you were behind there. But then as your
[00:52:35] campaign picked up and people started to actually see who you are when people came to vote on election
[00:52:40] day, you, you won election day, but you didn't win all the votes combined because of people that
[00:52:46] had voted early and got it correct. But it shows the trajectory and the momentum of what you're doing.
[00:52:52] We've got some great momentum that we're excited about and indeed even put in paint a broader
[00:52:57] picture. We started this late November and the election was March 6. That's a very little time
[00:53:03] for anybody to get a campaign together. So, and we're going up against one of my opponents,
[00:53:08] that's probably all of ended up spending when the numbers come in between $6 and $7 million,
[00:53:13] which is a record for self-funding for a campaign like this. Another opponent, similar, very high
[00:53:20] spending, very much self-funded and it was already a state representative, so had some kind of
[00:53:24] campaign machine in place. You're trying to catch up. You're trying to build a campaign team
[00:53:30] and a message within almost no time at all and no money whatsoever. That's not an easy task.
[00:53:37] Only a couple months. Usually you start like a year out if you're going to run for Congress.
[00:53:42] But that just wasn't the case here because Ted Poe announced retirement about mid-November.
[00:53:47] So, we had a lot to overcome. We built that momentum quickly. We worked hard.
[00:53:53] We worked hard. We got the message out. It's meant as many people as we could and you know, it worked.
[00:53:59] We snuck by, it was not got to that third-place spot because as you said, so we were behind
[00:54:04] during early voting and mail-in voting because that stuff happened so early. There was just no way
[00:54:10] from my momentum to catch up in time. But by election day, we were far and away first place and
[00:54:15] were able to sneak into the runoff. So, now we're in the runoff and that's May 22nd. So we got another
[00:54:21] two months to really prepare and get our message out there and I think we're excited about it.
[00:54:27] I think it's going to go well. So you talked about this a little bit. You talked about money.
[00:54:34] Money. And as disturbing as it is, what's driving so much of who wins these elections
[00:54:41] is who has the most money? Because that's how you get the advertising. That's how you get the
[00:54:44] mailers. That's how you get the word out there. I mean, if you don't have the money to pay for
[00:54:48] advertising, then no one knows who you're, and you don't get any votes. So as disturbing as that is,
[00:54:53] without money, you have a real hard time. I mean, you've done an amazing job with the
[00:55:00] limited amount. I mean, how much money did you go into that last election? We spending.
[00:55:04] Ended up spending total about $200,000. So we were outspent in a 30 over 30 into one.
[00:55:12] Easily. And I would say more if you count what everybody else, you know,
[00:55:17] the first and second place also spent against me. I mean, you know, it's something to be proud of.
[00:55:24] So I think we can win. It is $200,000 and you win up against somebody that spent $6 million.
[00:55:30] And yeah, like I said, unfortunately, money drives so much of these elections. And that's why you end up with
[00:55:37] those people that, I mean, I know you can't well, technically or possibly, but you're not supposed
[00:55:44] to be able to buy an election, right? Right. But I mean, the first thing that you talk about that
[00:55:50] spent $6 million without that money, I mean, where would it be? It was a female, right?
[00:55:55] Where would she have been without spending that money? I mean, I'm assuming she wouldn't have been
[00:55:58] anywhere. No. So she was able to buy herself at least third place. Right. And maybe if she had
[00:56:03] another more money, she would have been able to buy herself first place. That's a scary thought.
[00:56:08] It is. I mean, you know, I don't like the way campaign finance works. I don't think you should
[00:56:14] be able to sell fund that much for a race. And you know, I understand that there's some good
[00:56:19] arguments to make that you can sell fund, you know, over what the individual limit is.
[00:56:24] But to that extent, I mean, it's, you know, it truly creates a donor class of politicians.
[00:56:30] And like that's just, I don't think that's what we want as American people. And it's up, but it's
[00:56:36] up to voters in the end to decide. It's up to voters to see through that. And, you know, I always
[00:56:40] encourage, just go out and do your research. You know, just do enough to go on the websites of each
[00:56:44] candidate and get a filter where they are watched them. Watch their videos. See how they speak. See how
[00:56:49] they would represent you. See how they would articulate your values. You know, we put up YouTube
[00:56:54] videos all the time. You can always watch me in interviews. You know, we're coming or listen to podcasts,
[00:57:00] listen to Jocca's podcast. And, you know, because you want people to get to know you and you need
[00:57:06] to be out there with folks. You need to be meeting people everywhere you go. And that's how we want,
[00:57:11] you know, that's how we built that connection with the voter. That's how we built momentum,
[00:57:16] just getting out and meeting people and inspiring them and connecting with them. That's, that's,
[00:57:21] that's still works. And we proved that. That's one of the things that you did while your opponents
[00:57:26] were spending a bunch of money. You put on your running shoes. Yeah. And ran through your entire district.
[00:57:32] Right. I did, uh, limp a lot of the way, too, because, uh, we talked about over preparing. Well,
[00:57:37] sometimes you can under prepare. And, uh, when you're running a campaign, there's not a lot of
[00:57:42] time to get your running in. And so I started that 100 mile run and, um, it was going well.
[00:57:47] You know, so I want to back up a little bit. We, we playing this a while out. It was going to be five
[00:57:51] days. We're going to cross the whole district. Really show that dedication. I want to, I want to,
[00:57:56] get on the ground. I want to show the dedication to every inch of this district. And, um, with,
[00:58:00] with whatever publicity we get out of it, we're going to use it for good cause. And we, we set up a
[00:58:04] gofundme account. It's still active if you want to donate to it. Let's gofundme.com slash rebuild
[00:58:09] Houston with Dan Crenshaw. And that money goes to three particular volunteer groups that I was
[00:58:15] able to identify and vet that are still out there every day rebuilding people's homes. Because
[00:58:20] that, I mean, that is still going on. I always try to let everybody know if you're a contractor.
[00:58:23] If you've got any expertise, please come volunteer in Houston. We are backed up into, you know,
[00:58:28] it is, it is tough to find a contractor these days. Even if people have the money to pay for it,
[00:58:33] they still can't get any availability. The demand is so high that the prices have gone way
[00:58:37] through the roof. We need more people there nationwide. So, you know, police come to Houston.
[00:58:42] There's a work for you and there's good work. There's a lot left to do when people need it.
[00:58:47] So, in these volunteer groups are out doing it, you know, for $57,000, between $57,000,
[00:58:52] they can rebuild a whole home because all their labor is free. It's volunteers. And they
[00:58:56] do a great job and they're working a lot of these neighborhoods where individuals just can't
[00:59:00] do with themselves. And it was, it was just great to see that. A lot of church affiliated groups
[00:59:06] always out there helping. And, you know, it makes you proud to be a tax and it makes you proud to be an
[00:59:11] American. So, we finished that run, you know, by day three, it was certainly limping through most of it.
[00:59:17] It changed out my shoes, day five, we're running pretty well again, but it was tough.
[00:59:22] And it was fun. It was great. It was a great experience. You see people honking at you,
[00:59:27] maybe because you're in their way, maybe because, maybe because they're supporting you. I don't know.
[00:59:32] But, I mean, it was just, it was pretty credible experience to see the supporters out there to see,
[00:59:39] just, you know, it was, it was great. We went, and that was, that was when early voting started.
[00:59:45] It was, we voted on day one of that run. And, and, and, and, and, you know, two weeks later on election
[00:59:52] day, we, we wrapped it up and it was, it was a good night. It was a, we're on pins and needles.
[00:59:56] It was until 2 a.m. that we knew that we'd actually come into second place by 155 votes.
[01:00:03] So, you think anybody says their vote doesn't count, doesn't matter. That's wrong.
[01:00:07] It, it truly matters. I mean, every single vote matter, I can't think every volunteer enough.
[01:00:13] Can't think every supporter enough. Because a lot of people went out and they maybe got 10 votes
[01:00:17] here and there, maybe a hundred votes here and there. You know, individuals were able to do that
[01:00:21] and put us over the top because they believed in the message. They believed in our candidacy.
[01:00:25] And it was just, you know, it's humbling. And it's, it's almost, you feel a weight of
[01:00:30] responsibility when people put their trust in you like that as you should feel it because you
[01:00:34] don't want to disappoint them. You know, you can't let your supporters down and I truly
[01:00:39] feel that way about every vote. So what's, so what's next right now?
[01:00:45] We're the runoff. The runoff. It's just me and Kevin Roberts. And just, you know, it's
[01:00:52] May 22nd early voting starts again a couple weeks before that and it's a lot of the same.
[01:00:56] You know, we, we stick to the basics. We professionalize our organization. We ask for more money.
[01:01:02] Please donate a crenchoffacommer.com and we, and we, and we, so that's actually real though. Like
[01:01:08] you kind of, you kind of joke about it. And I know you're like, like, most good human beings,
[01:01:14] you feel uncomfortable saying, hey, give me some money. But the reality is,
[01:01:19] for you to take this to the next level that you need, you need money. And so when you say that
[01:01:25] kind of jokingly that the reality is, if you don't get that money, it's going to be really
[01:01:29] hard to swing an upset. Right. And so, so that's what's the, what's the website?
[01:01:34] It's crenchoffacongerist.com. CR-E-N-S-H-A-W-F-O-R-Congerist.com. You can donate there. You can check out the
[01:01:41] can you see there. You know, CR interviews, your YouTube videos, or commercials, my bio, everything.
[01:01:46] It's all in one spot. Follow us on Facebook. We've got a pretty exciting social media presence.
[01:01:51] That's how we get a lot of our word out because, you know, it's cheap and it hits the right people.
[01:01:56] So, crenchoffacongerist.com. And you know, that money, we spend it wisely. It doesn't go to
[01:02:01] anything silly. It's, you know, we need it to send mail to voters, you know, to get our message out.
[01:02:06] We need to put out radio ads. We need it to buy t-shirts for volunteers and to buy yard signs so that
[01:02:12] people can put them in their yards and create that upwelling of support where everybody's got
[01:02:17] a damn crenchoff sign. You know, that's how we do it. And it's, but it's, we work our butts off.
[01:02:23] I promise you that we work for, we work for every vote out there. And I actually believe that's how
[01:02:29] it should be. And that's how it would be in Congress. Yeah. That's awesome. And I know you're on a kind of
[01:02:37] a time schedule today. And I know you got some other things that you want to do here while you're
[01:02:42] out here in sunny, sunny, San Diego, which isn't too sunny today. But I think we just hit everything
[01:02:49] of how people can best support your cause. And obviously, I'm in crenchoffer Congress on Twitter,

[01:03:46] me. You know, it's, it's helping Texans. It's given Texans a representative. I think they can be proud of.
[01:03:52] We're so often just disgruntled and ashamed of our politicians. And we don't really think they're
[01:03:57] working on our behalf because we don't always elect people who truly put service before self. And,
[01:04:04] and, you know, part of this campaign is convincing those that we do have a future. And we do have
[01:04:10] a future of leaders that will attract people to conservative values and, um, and keep those values
[01:04:17] alive and, and, and again, give us a leader that we can be proud of. Awesome. Well, I think they'll
[01:04:22] definitely find that with you. Thanks for coming on and it's honored to be here. Until you come back
[01:04:29] on, once you get the W, once you get the win, come back on and you can explain to us where you're going
[01:04:35] from there. Absolutely. So how we did it. Get out and vote. May 22nd everybody. Thanks, Dan. Thanks for coming
[01:04:40] on. Thank you. So Dan has left the studio, but he's also left some very good ways to support him
[01:04:52] and what he's doing. And echo Charles, speaking of support, yeah. Maybe you could tell the troops
[01:05:03] how they can support this cause. Sure. If they want, if they want. And while they're supporting
[01:05:12] this cause, also support themselves. Which is important. If they want, you know. Do you
[01:05:17] what I just said? Yeah, very important. I said important. Yeah, you said it correct. Yeah.
[01:05:22] Two T's and now on. Normally there's no T's in it for me. Yeah. Yeah. Important.
[01:05:28] Kind of like the British accent, sometimes they don't say the T's too, and sometimes the same
[01:05:31] really solid, you know. Like they say. This is not back to reality. They don't say the T.
[01:05:39] Reality or reality. And then the last back to support. Yeah, if you want to support.
[01:05:47] Support your joints. This is how you support your joints. If you're an already.
[01:05:53] Jocquoise supplements. Good supplements. Crill oil. Super crill. Jocquoise super
[01:05:58] crill oil and joint warfare. Some of them is for your joints maintain them. Also, discipline.
[01:06:08] Pre-workout. Pre-mission. Cognitive, enhancer plus physical.
[01:06:15] Enhancer. Force multiplier. For a small supply. Yeah, there's layers. Yeah, actually. Yeah.
[01:06:22] You know, it's like a blend. It's a good blend. Yeah. I am running low on the crill oil. I did not take my
[01:06:28] own advice for the description. Subscription. Yeah. So it to manually get some more. But hey, man,
[01:06:36] that's life sometimes. If you want to get on the subscription thing,
[01:06:41] re up every what is it month. Right? Because it's a month supply. You can pay. Yeah, yeah,
[01:06:45] however much you take. And that's the smart way to do it. Totally is joint warfare too.
[01:06:50] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fully. It's the one. I think the combo is the best way to go for sure.
[01:06:55] Recommend the combo. Nonetheless, you get them at originmain.com. Good way to support and support
[01:07:01] yourself as a big one. Also, at originmain.com, there are guise and rash guards for you.
[01:07:06] Jiu Jitsu journey. If you have chosen or will choose to go on that Jiu Jitsu journey. There's
[01:07:13] no reason why not. You should go on the Jiu Jitsu. Yeah. And if you're going to ask what if I'm
[01:07:18] small, big, large overweight under the younger young, the answer is start Jiu Jitsu. Yeah. How
[01:07:26] do you get in shape for Jiu Jitsu? Yeah. That's what you do. Yeah. You know, Tim Tim always says like,
[01:07:33] oh, you know, he's been out of the Jiu Jitsu for a long time. Tim Ford. Yeah. And he'll be able to go.
[01:07:37] Okay. Yeah. I'm going to get back in shape. Take a, you're looking at the wrong lane. Yeah,
[01:07:43] you go back to Jiu Jitsu. Did you just get your inshate? Yeah. You'll be, you'll be fine.
[01:07:47] You're going to suffer a little bit. But might even suffer a lot. It's hard. You got to be hard
[01:07:53] mentally for a guy like Timbo because he's a purple belt. Yeah. And so he's going to come and
[01:07:59] get beat by some white belts. I mean, not white belts. Buy some blue belts. Yeah. So blue belts.
[01:08:03] Because you know, some blue belts, they bring it. Yeah. And they can keep bringing it.
[01:08:07] So she's bringing it. They've been in there. Yeah. Khabish. Yeah. Yes. So Tim would be like,
[01:08:12] come back and then, and it adds that level of anxiety. Because you know, when you feel
[01:08:16] yourself, gal, well, you probably don't know this. But if you feel yourself gasating and you're
[01:08:19] like, you know, I was going to gas now, you're really gasating now that anxiety goes up and
[01:08:22] you get some more. That's how it is. He wants to avoid all that stuff. That's what I think. But,
[01:08:27] you know, that's when you put all these weird expectations and yourself, that's my opinion
[01:08:30] and the Jiu Jitsu. So just going to Jiu Jitsu and learn Jiu Jitsu and when you do, you're going to
[01:08:35] want a G. If you do G, because you can do no G as well. But when you choose a G, I recommend.
[01:08:44] You recommend. I think there's only one recommendation. I agree. In all seriousness, there's only one
[01:08:50] recommendation. Yeah. And I've been through a lot of G. I have a lot of G. Experience. Yeah. We'll say
[01:08:56] a significant amount of G experience. And the origin G has proven legitimately to be the best one
[01:09:02] kind of by far too. Yeah. There's just one that I used to use. It's to those good. It was fine.
[01:09:08] And it was like good. Yeah. There's a difference though. There's a difference between this G's
[01:09:12] good. Yeah. I think you get an origin G. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You know, it's funny. Like, you know,
[01:09:17] how like when you get a new G in a Raskard or whatever. And you're kind of fired up with a
[01:09:20] little train because you got your new G. Yeah. I think you're kid with the new G. Yeah. You know,
[01:09:23] it's that. It's that faster. That feeling didn't wear off like for a while. Did you feel that
[01:09:29] like when we rolled, when we were both wearing new origin G's? I did refired up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:34] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I did you think maybe it was going to be the day.
[01:09:36] Oh, brother, I could I always think it's going to be the day always. Yeah. Dang.
[01:09:45] Because maybe one day they're willing to do it. I always think it's going to be the day, too.
[01:09:48] Maybe it's not up. Maybe it will. I don't know. Could be the day. Yeah.
[01:09:53] Anyway, origin main.com get your G there. When you choose to get a G, there's compression gear to
[01:10:00] Raskard. If you do no G, there's Raskard's there too. All made in America. Yeah. I was going to say
[01:10:04] all made in America. Yeah. Which is like it's no big deal. No, it's a huge deal. Yeah. It's a huge deal.
[01:10:09] Made in America in Maine in our factory by awesome workers. And it's not the kind where
[01:10:16] by crafts crafts people crafts crafts crafts crafts crafts person crafts people. People man there. Some of the
[01:10:22] more females. Yeah. But their craftsman. Yeah. Men doesn't mean your man. Yeah.
[01:10:27] Me, your human. Yeah. As far as I know. Like modern man like man kind. Yeah. Yeah. There you go.
[01:10:36] So craftsman kind craftsman kind. Nonetheless, all made in America. Yes. And that is a big deal.
[01:10:43] And it's not the kind where it's like, yeah. Let's import all their things or whatever. And then
[01:10:47] we'll quote unquote make it in America where you tick the one check box. It's like, yeah,
[01:10:51] technically it's made. It's not that kind. It's the kind where they grow the cotton in America.
[01:10:58] What do they do after they grow the cotton? They harvest the cotton. They do. Well, they can die
[01:11:03] the cotton. And they weave the cotton. Yeah. There's all bunch of steps all done in America. Yeah.
[01:11:08] But the land of the cotton because it's not just cotton. It's an athletic. That's one of the
[01:11:13] problems with the old geese. They're all made just with with cotton. They're like crap. Yeah. And
[01:11:20] then why would you not get modern technology? Well, why? Because they don't have, they don't
[01:11:26] do you do you do to where they're making the geese? Yeah. Now. So like little issues that come up
[01:11:31] in you just just little or big ones or whatever one they come up in. I'll do it. I don't know.
[01:11:35] You put an origin ge in the dryer. It's dry like quick. Yeah. And because it's not all cotton.
[01:11:43] Yeah. Because if you remember it in the teams cotton kills. Sure. Cotton kills because it gets wet
[01:11:49] and then it's heavy and makes it cold. Yeah. It doesn't dry quick enough. Yeah. You get the blend going.
[01:11:57] Then you're good to go. There's all kinds of different leaves too, which is cool.
[01:12:00] Now let's go to origimain.com. You can check out with whichever one you want. If you want something
[01:12:04] get something also what you want to do is go to the immersion camp if you want. So do you
[01:12:15] do the immersion camp? It's not like a training camp for ADCC. No. It's an educational experience.
[01:12:21] Like you immerse yourself in that you can modulate to the level of your personal commitment
[01:12:29] to getting after it. Yes. So some people will be there and they're going to be really soar every day.
[01:12:37] Yeah. Because they're going to be getting after it. Some people are going to be brain. Their
[01:12:41] brain is going to be more sore than their body because they're going to be more looking at it
[01:12:44] from the education that they're going to have a learning new moves and techniques. Yeah. So that's
[01:12:50] cool about the immersion camp or some of us nothing is going to be sore because maybe it'll be
[01:12:56] sore for a little while and then we're just going to cruise a little bit exercise to brain more
[01:12:59] and then the body is going to go back and do whatever you like. Yeah. And there's a lot to go around
[01:13:03] and it's going to fun too. That's the thing. Yeah. What's cool to hang out with just a bunch of people
[01:13:07] that are going to get you for seven days. Yeah. And then they get like five tons of labs.
[01:13:13] And you don't have to stay there the whole time. Yeah. There's a first part in a second part.
[01:13:17] You know, it's like the first few days and then you can do this the second few days and then you can
[01:13:23] do all them if you want. So August 26 through September 2nd. We're going to be there.
[01:13:28] You know who else is going? No big deal. Dave Burke. Yeah. Yeah. Dave Burke got the bug.
[01:13:34] Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He's got the bug. Yeah. He'll call me for just like verbal advice. Oh he's
[01:13:39] do you be texting me about about like guard passage? Yeah. Like position. Some like a really?
[01:13:46] Hey, let's do it. Let's communicate about guard passing via text. Yeah. Amen. How do you
[01:13:51] catch the people with? Well, Americana. Yeah. And it's an interesting conversation because
[01:13:58] you know he says, oh well, the Americana's like what I use the most right now. And I told him
[01:14:04] like the Americana is actually not a really effective move. Right. Against any one that has trained
[01:14:10] for a little bit. Purple belt you're not going to you might catch an ablube belt in an Americana.
[01:14:15] Purple belt probably not going to happen. I did catch a black belt in Americana the other day.
[01:14:20] And it was like shame. Right. Like I got caught with the Americana. Yeah. And this this particular
[01:14:26] black belt was like shame. He hung his head and shame. He was like he got some Americana. Yeah. But
[01:14:32] I explained a Dave. The reason that the Americana is effective for him right now, the most effective
[01:14:39] I'm like is it the first submission that you learned? Yes, it is. So he's practiced at the
[01:14:44] most and he's figured out all the little nuanced things that you have to do right in order to make
[01:14:50] the move of a move work and the Americana work. So he's figured out some of those things
[01:14:56] because he's tried it a bunch even when he missed it he learned something. He didn't even know
[01:15:00] he learned something but he learned something. So he keeps trying and he got good with these.
[01:15:06] So he's good at the Americana. He's not going to get his people to know how to defend it yet,
[01:15:09] which is going to be a problematic. So you got it. You got to that's what happens. But isn't that
[01:15:15] part of the whole learning process though? Because I think they I mean remember when I'm
[01:15:20] assuming you had similar experience where you were sure you do Americana and you get them and
[01:15:24] you did certain moves for years. Like like for when I first started my first good move was the
[01:15:31] Ezekiel. In fact, I used to call it the Ezekiel. The Ezekiel. That's what I thought it was.
[01:15:38] That was what I wanted to call it. But it was I learned it like one of the first submissions I
[01:15:42] looked and then I just tried it all the time and I got pretty good at it. Then you realize that
[01:15:45] it's not that hard to defend the Ezekiel. Eventually when you start going against better
[01:15:47] guys. So then you got to move to the I think the next move that I actually started doing a lot of
[01:15:51] was the camera and I spent a couple of years at that camera and then I spent a couple of years at
[01:15:55] Crucifix. Then I spent a couple of years at the straight foot lock. And then you know so
[01:16:00] and you know just get a little bit of those position. Yeah that's how. But gave Burke
[01:16:05] back to my point. He's coming. He's coming to the camp. Yeah. And you know what else is I will see
[01:16:11] else. We'll see if we'll see if we'll see if life. Yeah. I hope we all have to work. Sure.
[01:16:17] Yeah. I blocked this off though. Yeah. Just sweet. Yeah that's really good fun. Yeah cool.
[01:16:22] Go man. If you could make that make that. What's the date on them again? August 26 through
[01:16:28] September 2nd. Oh yeah and if you want it if you do want to come you can go to origin main.com
[01:16:32] and you go to the merchant camp and you can sign up. Yeah you can come and hang out. It's a good
[01:16:36] lobster if you like lobster. Yeah. Yeah. He likes steak. Yeah. Hang out and Maine. Visit our factory.
[01:16:43] Yeah. Which is awesome. I think you can go like paddling, stand up, stand up, stand up,
[01:16:49] paddle and unloading and stuff. Yeah. All kinds of stuff. Yeah. Also good way to support yourself.
[01:16:56] If you choose to vary up your work up. Make it a little less boring. You always make it sound like
[01:17:02] I do these boring workouts. Yeah. And I just realize I'm taking that abuse for quite some time.
[01:17:07] Oh. My workouts are not boring. Yeah. In a fact they're boring and and hard. So they're hard.
[01:17:12] Yeah. So here's the thing where what boring is like just a complete matter of opinion. You know,
[01:17:19] so to me if you're going to do 20 reps squats, brass, 20 reps, brass, 20 reps until you're like
[01:17:30] that's kind of boring and have you ever done it before? Yes. You've done that one. Not your exact
[01:17:38] one. But yeah, I did do 20 reps. Watch some in fact. Yeah. You've done 20 reps squats that you can only
[01:17:44] squat 10 times. Well, that's physically impossible. But no. Yes. It is if you can only do 10 times.
[01:17:50] You can only do 10 times. No. You can do 20 times. You can do 20 times. You can do 20 times. No.
[01:17:54] That's it. That's not how it works. No. All right. Right. Hey, look. Take my word for it. You can
[01:17:59] physically do it 10 times mentally do it 20 times. Okay. You do it. So you imagine you do 20 times. Okay.
[01:18:05] It's a look. You can physically do it 10 times. I guess technically you're right. And I want to
[01:18:12] listen. I don't want to split hairs, but you're still not right. If you can do it 10 times,
[01:18:17] but you can do it 20 times because look, if you can do something 20 times, you can do it 10 times.
[01:18:20] So yes. But what you're saying is something that you, you know, max out at 10 times. The
[01:18:26] weight you use to max out at 10 times. You do it 20 times physically impossible.
[01:18:30] 10 times. 10 times. Well, apparently for echo. Oh, man. See. Anyway, back to the workout. Maybe that's
[01:18:37] where that skinny knee is gone. No, baby. No, baby. Anyway, if you want to very up the workout,
[01:18:50] go to on it.com slash jockel. Get some cool kettlebells. Yeah. Get some battle ropes. Get a
[01:18:56] maze. Get two maces. Have you won an alight on one boom? When you light them more interesting.
[01:19:01] I use them. So my workouts are interesting. All right. Well, there you go. Yeah,
[01:19:06] the interesting workout. Well, do it that way. That's what I would would what he said.
[01:19:11] Suggest. Okay. Anyway, go there. On it.com. Good stuff in there. Don't get addicted to the website
[01:19:18] because there's a lot of good information too on there. Because you could. Unless also
[01:19:23] good way to support when you get the books that jockel sometimes reviews on this podcast. I
[01:19:29] organized or we organized them on jockelbidcast.com. Click on the top. So the books from the
[01:19:34] episode, I got all the books listed there, including little articles that, you know, how
[01:19:39] sometimes you'll cover article. All list those on there too. How much research would you have to
[01:19:45] do if you knew nothing about this podcast or me? How much research would you have to do to figure out
[01:19:52] that we read books on the podcast and that they're all on jockelpodcast.com. The reason I
[01:20:01] ask this is because I've had people ask me on social media like a week ago, like on Twitter,
[01:20:09] do you like to read? Yeah. Right. Like that's a great. You don't have to dig very deep to
[01:20:16] know that answer. Yeah. Right. Do you like to read? Right. That this is a really low level
[01:20:25] question that doesn't take a whole lot of research to figure out. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I guess
[01:20:31] is that laziness or is it like, hey, this guy seems pretty accessible. I'm just going to ask him
[01:20:35] here he is. I wonder if he's got likes to read. I don't think the likelihood of it being laziness
[01:20:40] because obviously it's going to be different for different people but the likelihood of it being
[01:20:44] laziness is pretty low. I think I don't think it's laziness at all. I think it would be a mix
[01:20:50] or one of these things. Yeah. They just want to ask you a question that you know,
[01:20:57] that you're going to have an answer to or or maybe they're just new or maybe they know you
[01:21:02] from extreme ownership and you know, I know you wrote this cool book. Hey, do you like to read in general?
[01:21:09] Kind of maybe they're going to listen to your some big crush being too judgmental. Yeah. If you're
[01:21:15] jumping to that conclusion that it's laziness. Yeah. You like to read like we literally have a podcast
[01:21:22] about books that we read and and then people say, do you have a list of books? Do you
[01:21:28] have any books you recommend? Yeah. Do you have a book list? Do you have a reading list? These
[01:21:35] are all things I could ask on a regular basis. Is this kind of like the time I ask you, hey,
[01:21:39] do you know, an of any gun ranges? You said, yeah, Google going Google and search gunaries.
[01:21:44] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel the same tone. Here's the thing you never
[01:21:50] to really know a when people are coming in the game. You don't know what their deal is or where they're
[01:21:55] coming from. So yeah, like maybe or maybe maybe they just heard you on Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan
[01:22:01] and was like, boom, this guy's super interesting. Let me go straight to him and start talking
[01:22:05] on kind of thing or start asking questions rather than going on the internet. Let me research
[01:22:10] who this guy is and what he likes and doesn't like to do with such a test. Am I am I lazy
[01:22:16] in the fact that when I want to know something, I'll Google it. No, that's not easy. Okay. I don't
[01:22:21] yeah, I don't think so. As opposed to what? I don't know saying going to school and studying
[01:22:30] it first. I guess it's not a good idea. You know, alternative nonetheless, if you are feeling
[01:22:38] not lazy, actually this has nothing to do with laziness because this is more a convenience that
[01:22:43] I think would be beneficial or I thought would be beneficial for people who are looking for the
[01:22:48] books that you cover and ways to get them. That's why I organized these books on talk about
[01:22:52] yes, I'll call the website. So yeah, they're all there by and by chance they're kind of in order
[01:22:58] of preference in order of the way you almost the way you should read them. Maybe I'd have to shift
[01:23:03] some of them now. Yeah. I should put them in a different order because there's some books that I
[01:23:07] read again. I was like man, I should be at this would be near the top. I mean about faces is number
[01:23:11] is number one. Right. You should read that book first. Yeah. People ask me that all the time.
[01:23:16] What's your favorite? I've already read extreme ownership. Is there another book you recommend?
[01:23:20] I read well and I've read all your books. What books did I read next about Facebook? I don't
[01:23:25] know, David Hacworth. Yeah. That's like you're right. No one. Yeah. So anyways. Yeah. Make sense. I mean,
[01:23:31] I organized them by episode. Yeah. And most recent episode. Right. With book. But if you go back to
[01:23:36] episode one, which there's no book, but two, there's a book. And if you go in that order of reading,
[01:23:41] that's a good progression to get people to book. Oh, okay. Okay. Properly. I assume. Gotcha. So if you
[01:23:46] if you if you want to read your book, Jockel's book list in order of importance. In order importance,
[01:23:51] you go in chronological order, pur pod. Yes. With books. That's recommended. Not all podcast
[01:23:57] of books. That's right. That's right. Cool. Well, there it is. Again, just click on the books and
[01:24:01] boom, take a seat there, boom. Click through there, get your book. Easy way. Good way to support

[01:26:26] hands? I think it's called it hands. Exerp and hands extras, which means that echo has gone and put
[01:26:33] his cinematic flare. No. Oh, say, I put some music on it and I put some text on it. There it is.
[01:26:40] It's in the madhouse. It's in hands. A little bit of soft. It's in the madhouse. Yeah. All right. Well,
[01:26:45] there it is. There's some of those on there. That video as well. By the way, no big deal. I, when I got to the gym
[01:26:51] today, Carl, he says, hey, I saw you on a world star. That's what you made it. We made it straight up.
[01:27:04] Yeah. Popular culture. Yeah. Popular culture. We're on a world star. World star.
[01:27:10] If you don't know what world star is, it originally was for fights. That's what I knew it for.
[01:27:15] Yeah. That's how I think that's how it gained. Yeah. I think you, it was for like, it was for
[01:27:20] it was for like music videos. I think hip hop music videos and stuff like that. Then you get, you know,
[01:27:25] I used stuff. I would watch it because they because people would film street fights. I like to
[01:27:29] watch street fights. Sure. Learn a lot from street fights. And what's funny is it became such a
[01:27:33] popular culture thing that when people would be recording the fights that they're going to
[01:27:37] then put on world star, they would be saying world star during the fight. Someone be filming
[01:27:43] and saying, world star, this is going on world star. Well, now guess what's on world star. That
[01:27:47] goes video. We made it. Jockels on the way star. World star. Dang. That's good. Nonetheless,
[01:27:55] cross cultural boundaries. Yeah. Okay. World star. Well, star. Maybe it happened. You did 100%.
[01:28:04] Yeah. YouTube. You know, so. People who don't star. Thanks for putting me on there. Yeah. That was good.
[01:28:09] That is good. Awesome. So yeah. YouTube. Good one. Good way to support. Also,
[01:28:14] Jockels store. It's called Jockels store. Obviously. Jockels store.com. Obviously. That's where you can get
[01:28:23] shirts, t-shirts. Some travel mugs on there. Some rash guards. More rash guards. This is like
[01:28:28] Jockel gear rash guards. So compared to how would you compare them to the origin? Because actually
[01:28:34] they're made. They're similar. Yeah. They're similar. They're in Jockel. They're more like geared
[01:28:38] tour light toward like Jockel. Well, let's. Yeah. Let's say this. That from a, from a visual perspective,
[01:28:48] there's a way that Jockel gear looks and there's a way that origin gear looks. There's some areas
[01:28:54] that overlap. There's some areas that don't overlap. Some of the, let's call them color combinations
[01:29:01] that my brother Pete Roberts puts together. They wouldn't be allowed in the Jockel store. Yeah.
[01:29:06] They wouldn't be Jockel gear. And there's some things that Jockel gear does that wouldn't be appropriate
[01:29:12] for origin because origin is a little bit in the other direction. Sure. The overlapping areas are
[01:29:20] good. But if you want your gear made in America is one place to get it done right. That's our factory
[01:29:28] up in Maine. True story. So yeah, bone making it rash guards there as well. Some patches.
[01:29:34] Those are restocked. A lot of people were hitting me up. That's why for patches. Yeah. It's weird that
[01:29:39] people have to hit you up that you just don't pay attention to the stock and say, wow, I love running low.
[01:29:43] I should be order more. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's not that important to you. No, no, no, it's important.
[01:29:48] So I got to handle on it and I think I've a solid system where you know, we're going to run into
[01:29:54] way less of that. If any of that. Okay. That's good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[01:29:57] Unless the women's stuff on there are some hats because it doesn't mean a lot to me. Yeah.
[01:30:01] Just I'm saying that's cool. So maybe I should be more. I should do a better job of
[01:30:05] expressing how important it is to me for people if they want patches to be able to get one.
[01:30:10] Yeah. Maybe I haven't. I obviously haven't done a good job. Yeah. It's your fault. It's your fault. It is.
[01:30:16] So yeah, Dracolster.com. That's a good good way to support. Also, psychological warfare. If you
[01:30:21] know what that is, that's an album. An album. Not a music album. It's a to
[01:30:26] soak and word spoken word with tracks, jockel tracks. And each track is designated, formulated,
[01:30:35] engineered. It's engineered is what it is to help you through little points of weakness that you
[01:30:42] might run into on your campaign against weakness. Like if you want to skip, I always say if you
[01:30:50] want to skip the workout, if you're like, hey, I'm too tired. I don't feel like it. I don't feel like it.
[01:30:56] I start with Alan because that's essentially why this whole thing exists because that
[01:31:02] that was the issue that was the genesis of this album. Yeah. Was echo questioning how
[01:31:10] he could overcome these moments a week. Or how I do and then I kind of answered one of them
[01:31:14] and he said, we do record those things. Yeah. You know what's funny is that I asked you that
[01:31:18] before and it wasn't that specific question, but it was essentially that question and be like,
[01:31:22] hey, what do you do? And then you like he kind of gave me a look in more like as if your feelings
[01:31:27] don't matter kind of thing. You basically pull the jockel. No, it doesn't matter if I got a
[01:31:31] little bit of this kind of thing. I got to ask this somewhere, you know, someone said, hey,
[01:31:34] can you tell us a little bit more about your morning routine? Like what you,
[01:31:38] like it's so you know, you can't. I know you got to barely, but can you tell us more about your
[01:31:41] morning routine? I was like, yeah, I listen. My morning routine is extremely, extremely important.
[01:31:48] So yours, yours, the steps of the jockel morning routine. First of all, you set your alarm clock.
[01:31:54] You set all your alarm clocks. You set the first one at 430. You set the next one at 435. You set
[01:32:00] the next one at 440 and you have your backups. By the way, you don't set your backups at the same
[01:32:05] time because you don't want to be fumbling around with three alarm clocks in the morning. It's good
[01:32:09] tip. I said, then you get done with that. Then when the alarm clock goes off, you get up. You get out
[01:32:14] of bed. Then you go and it's important that you get your toothbrush out. It's enough brush.
[01:32:19] And then I use 46 brush strokes on each side of my mouth. And no more no less. And then I spit
[01:32:28] three times into this piece of mouth. Oh my god. Here's the more routine dude. You get up and you go.
[01:32:33] Yeah. Yeah. Well, then again. No, I know. Right. You know. Yeah. I know. But it's like
[01:32:39] the reality is, is someone going to write down my morning routine. Then fall the exact same thing.
[01:32:44] And would that be good for him? Maybe. I don't know. Well, here's the morning routine then.
[01:32:48] Get up and go. Get up and get up. Yeah. But here's like some people they they focus on. And
[01:32:56] this can be beneficial from from what I hear. They focus on or they identify certain things they do
[01:33:02] in a morning routine that helps them that like set some up. No, I mean, you're whatever.
[01:33:06] It's a very morning routine. And I actually wrote about in the in the field manual. It's like
[01:33:10] the morning routine starts the night before. Yeah. Yeah. The morning routine starts when you
[01:33:15] get your gear ready because you want to be fumbling around in the morning. Don't wait. Don't
[01:33:20] set yourself up to fumble around what things in the morning. Right. That's just a bad thing. Don't do that.
[01:33:25] So you you do have your gear ready. You know, for me, I'm very systematic in pretty much
[01:33:31] the way I'm saying. Yeah. And so you know, I have like all my workout gear is in the bathroom on
[01:33:37] hangers. You know, pair shorts shirt on each hanger. There's six of them. They're all the same.
[01:33:42] There's no thought process that's needed. They're all matching. And I have the same kind of socks,
[01:33:48] all my socks are the same. I do have black socks and white socks, but one drawer is just completely
[01:33:55] white socks all the same. You grab those and put those on. Boom. You brush your teeth, boom.
[01:34:00] You take you. I take my supplements in the morning and at night, but I take my my cereal oil and my
[01:34:06] my joint warfare. Boom. And then I go hit it. How much water do you drink? It's it's I drink when I'm thirsty.
[01:34:13] I drink and then if I'm I don't measure it. So you don't be like, okay, no, mix. Yeah, I drink when I'm
[01:34:18] thirsty. You want to hungry. But if you drink water when you thirsty, you're already 2% dehydrated.
[01:34:25] Okay. Well, I drink about 3% more than this. All right. There you go. So you 1% over hydrated or hydrated.
[01:34:35] Within. No, let's, but we'll, you know, like, I'll drink a whole thing like the, you know, the
[01:34:40] mugs that we have to travel that they're three ounces. By the way, I'll drink a whole thing at that.
[01:34:44] Just routine. That's kind of the routine. But was it like in the morning? Yeah. You like you pound it?
[01:34:49] Sure. If you want to call it pound it. Why do you drink it? Because you want to stay hydrated.
[01:34:55] Yeah, but get the water back in there, man. Get, get it. It's good for you. Water is good for you.
[01:35:00] By the way. Yeah. No doubt better than sold out in the morning. You're trick a coke in the morning. No.
[01:35:04] Bro, it's like, hey, where's we did these monster masses in the back and the derbs.
[01:35:11] So my son was doing a monster bash with us when he was like six or six. Well, what's the, what's the
[01:35:15] monster masses like you? Oh, you do rope climbs that you do a sprint. Okay. I work out. When I'm
[01:35:19] the, you do pull ups and then you, and they put little things in there sometimes. So one of the
[01:35:24] things that they had to do was drink a coke through a straw. So you're like doing pull ups in a rope
[01:35:30] time and then you got a coke. You told me. Yeah. And so he, I think that was the first time you
[01:35:35] ever tried soda. Yeah. And he's like, yeah, he's nasty. It's, well, there's, if you're not
[01:35:41] having a warning soda though. Yeah. But what, there's two elements to drinking a soda,
[01:35:47] especially for the first time is, okay, it tastes weird. Sweet sugary and carbonated. Yeah. The
[01:35:51] carbonated will burn your mind. It feels like it's burning them out. Yeah. So like it. Yeah. You can't do that.
[01:35:56] You can. That's not right in the middle of the workout, too. Yeah. Come through that. Well,
[01:35:59] you keep in mind. You just described your morning routine. You answered the question that they
[01:36:03] were at. I know. I know. I don't think that's why I said, look, I'm not trying to be negative against
[01:36:07] morning routines. Yeah. And there's pretty much what I do. But the, the reason is I think people think,
[01:36:15] oh, if I have, if I knew you're morning routine, then I'd know what the secret is. Yeah. So like,
[01:36:19] hey, man, the secret is get up and go do something. That's secret. Yeah. I'm not going to,
[01:36:24] here's the deal. Here's the deal. I'm not going to sell you my morning routine. It's the solution.
[01:36:28] Your promise. Now, I will say that if you fumble around in the morning, it's going to cause
[01:36:33] you problems throughout the day. So don't fumble around the morning. Set your set your life up correctly.
[01:36:37] So that you're not fumbling around. That's good. I'm not going to sell you my morning routine as
[01:36:43] the solution to your problems. Yes. I'm not going to do that. But I will say that if you do have a good
[01:36:50] system that you go through in the morning, it will set up your day correctly. Yeah. That's why I think
[01:36:56] people ask what people want it. And I get it. Okay. I'm not trying to be like a jerk, right? I'm not
[01:37:00] sure that negative. I got some kind of making fun of what you're making fun of. I'm making fun of
[01:37:04] morning routines a little bit. But at the same time, I have one and I stick to it. Yeah. But I think
[01:37:09] what I say is the thing. That's the thing. I don't actually have something and I stick to it. Like,
[01:37:13] I do this is what is I follow the functional thing that works in your stick to it. Yeah. And I
[01:37:18] stick to it. So that's that. But I do, I didn't like design my morning routine. I didn't see
[01:37:25] it. I'm going to design this program. No, it's like, I know what works. It's functional. And that's
[01:37:29] what I do. I do things that work. Yeah. And everyone else wants to know what works. Okay. Well,
[01:37:33] there's not everyone figured out on their own what works. That's what he's the thing.
[01:37:37] You're morning routine. You're ultimately right. And I think this is that super important not
[01:37:42] to forget or not to like miss interpret where you know, you just, the quote, you just said like
[01:37:48] you're morning routines and not going to be the solution to your problems kind of thing. I think
[01:37:52] that's what people do think. I think that that here someone with a level height in my opinion,
[01:37:56] I don't, I don't know. But this is what it seems like where someone with a level head and they
[01:38:01] want to look for just that just just set one thing that's going to help them just a little bit.
[01:38:06] Yeah. So they're going to be like, hey, let me, let me formulate a good morning routine. I
[01:38:09] don't know that much about effective routines. So let me look into that. Just as a little helper,
[01:38:14] not the solution to my problems, which I think some people may kind of miss, no, you're right.
[01:38:19] And that's why, like I said, I'm not belittling the idea that a morning routine is helpful because
[01:38:25] it certainly is. It might add some, some tiny bit of help to your day, if you're doing the right thing.
[01:38:35] Some benefits. Thank you. It might benefit your day, which is positive. Will it cure your overall
[01:38:42] problems of life? No, but you know what? It's a good place to start. That's why we say wake up early,
[01:38:47] right? Yeah. That's part of the interview. Part of the part of the routine. So yeah. But even how you,
[01:38:51] I guess I am being a jerk. Yeah, but here's the thing. It seems like, let me just, let me just,
[01:38:56] like, yeah, get on a good morning routine. That's a good idea. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not trying
[01:39:01] to make fun of it. I was, but I'm not anymore. It seems like you're making fun of it for people,
[01:39:06] because this is what it may be sounded like when someone asks you. What's your morning routine?
[01:39:10] It sounds like you're kind of with this presumption, like you're presuming or assuming that
[01:39:16] they think it's going to solve all their problems. That's kind of what I'm making or jerk. Yes,
[01:39:20] but in that very specific direction. Like if someone says, hey, look, I'm always looking for
[01:39:25] things to benefit my day, my effectiveness, you know, I do this and do that. And I found that this
[01:39:31] even helps a little bit here. And hey, what's your morning routine? Maybe I can incorporate one
[01:39:34] or more. Oh, yeah. If you're a two-million to mine, that'll give me a little bit of help, too.
[01:39:38] I don't think you would have came off like that. Definitely. Definitely that would have been a very
[01:39:41] good question. Yes. Oh, yeah. Here's what I do. Yeah. So there you go. So you didn't how you
[01:39:45] said the question, like you were kind of impersonating the hypothetical question. What's your
[01:39:51] morning routine? Like making them sound like you're not going to be. Yes. Sorry. Sorry,
[01:39:55] sorry, everyone. No, not so good. So good. We got to the bottom of it. You know, you're drinking water.
[01:40:01] Another drink you can drink is you can drink something called Jocco White Tea. Sure. It's available
[01:40:06] on Amazon. Now, this is the only tea available. Not only in America, but in the world that comes
[01:40:14] within 8,000 pound deadlift guarantee. So there's no other tea. I know there's some out there that
[01:40:21] are better, they say 6,000. They say they can get you 6,000 pound deadlift. Yeah. There's I've seen
[01:40:26] I've seen 7,200. Right? 7,200. 7,200. Some teas. Some white teas say they'll get you 7,200.
[01:40:33] There's only one white tea that'll get you the guaranteed 8,000 pound deadlift. Good.
[01:40:40] There's some layers on the tea, which I kind of remember last time, but I went in or interrupt
[01:40:45] you. You're talking is first episode of this podcast. Absolute first one. Oh, yeah. I think the only
[01:40:53] one that doesn't start with this is Ducco podcast. That's because you had a different vision
[01:40:58] of the podcast. The time with no, we, yeah. Nonetheless, it started with you were thinking,
[01:41:05] I think this podcast is gonna be 100% cruising. That's what it felt like. That first one,
[01:41:11] that's what it felt like. Yeah. No, in your mind. Yeah. In my mind. If you listen,
[01:41:16] yeah, now you were in good sea. I was not, you know, I was not ready to cruise. I came in there with a
[01:41:20] game plan. Yeah. And the game plan did not take cruise on it. The game plan said, get after.
[01:41:24] Well, it was fun. You shut it down so quick. Right when you heard it, you were like, you know,
[01:41:29] you want to cut it at this point, not the little, like we just rolled into a conversation. Yeah.
[01:41:35] But here's the thing with that conversation. As far as the layers go, we talk about white tea.
[01:41:40] Yeah. You called it chai. Yeah. No, because I was trying to remember what kind of tea that was.
[01:41:43] I don't know about the tea, especially back then. Nonetheless, you were always on the pomegranate.
[01:41:48] Yeah. That started when I was in the dirt. So anyway, so anyways, you can get that. You can get it on
[01:41:55] Amazon and then you can start deadlifting properly. Yeah. There's some books that you can get.
[01:42:03] Way the warrior kid. I get questions all the time about how you should raise your kids.
[01:42:09] Mm-hmm. And not just how to raise them, because they people know how to raise them, but they,
[01:42:13] but they, not how to raise them, but how to raise them. Like they know what they want the kids to,
[01:42:18] they know the values that they want the kids to have, but they're not sure how to give them the values.
[01:42:22] Right. They don't know how to do that. So it, real simple, get them this book. Way the warrior kid.
[01:42:28] That's, you know, discipline, eating habits, working out, dealing with bullies, how to study
[01:42:33] all those things are in there. These are the things you want. Not just your kid, but the children
[01:42:38] of the world to have these type of qualities. And now on top of that, we have way the warrior
[01:42:47] kid, too, which is called marksmission, talks about some important lessons, controlling your temper,
[01:42:54] overcoming fear of failure, working hard, saving money, being frugal, dealing with verbal abuse,
[01:43:02] helping other people, starting businesses. Yeah. I said that. Mm-hmm. And
[01:43:09] becoming a leader. Again, all the, there's no human being that would look at the lessons from
[01:43:15] way of the warrior kid and say, I don't want my kid to have that quality. No, the qualities are in there.
[01:43:24] So there's that. And if you want a good example of a warrior kid, check out IrishOx Ranch.com,
[01:43:32] where you can get soap that's handmade by young Aiden. Who's 12 years old, but he has a business,
[01:43:38] no big deal. He's making soap. Yeah. Was it just a goat milk soap? Yeah, that soap's actually good.
[01:43:44] Like to use. Oh, for sure. For sure. It's face it. You know how you have your friend and, you know,
[01:43:51] his wife makes soap on the weekend. Oh, yeah. You've sympathy purchase scenario. Yeah, you know,
[01:43:55] and you've got some sympathy purchase. And it's beautiful. It has the little packaging. And then you
[01:44:00] say, all right, it's soap. Let me go ahead and use some soap and you're like,
[01:44:03] brother, this isn't like usable soap. This is the novelty decorative item. It was a cool little
[01:44:07] educational experience because he asked me, you know, he was making soap. And he's, and he reached out to me,
[01:44:13] his dad is a farmer also a firefighter, but he's a farmer. Anyways, his dad and I were connected.
[01:44:20] I'd buy meat from his dad and, you know, he said, oh, my son wants to get in touch with you. But
[01:44:26] so as we're going through the process, he sends me like his label for the soap. Yeah. And,
[01:44:31] you know, it looked nice, but I'm going back with those needs to be in OCR standard. Yeah. And
[01:44:38] so anyways, yeah, it's cool little learning process. And yeah, you can get that soap. You can
[01:44:43] support a kid. That's a warrior kid. And the jocco soap motto, which I give aid, no credit for.
[01:44:49] Sorry, you're a good kid, but you didn't think of this. It took the, it took the master
[01:44:55] for marketing mind or jocco to come up with the motto for jocco soap, which is,
[01:45:00] stay clean. It's good. And you know, there's some layers on that too, right? I like it.
[01:45:07] What's the layer? Motorhead song. Oh, all right. There you go. And you like motorhead.
[01:45:11] And I, and a huge fan of motorhead. And you don't do any drug. So there's, there's kind of
[01:45:16] the reason that whenever I talk to people or people talk to me on the through social media or email
[01:45:22] and they've had a drug problem or an alcohol problem. And I always kind of sign off like, hey, stay clean.
[01:45:30] Stay clean. So because that's also what Lemmy from Motorhead was saying, stay clean. Like,
[01:45:36] don't let this kill you. Now Lemmy from Motorhead was a rare dude who did a lot of drugs now
[01:45:41] call and somehow was able to survive very well up to up to when he died drinking incredible amounts
[01:45:47] of jackdannels. Yeah, those some legit layers. But he always would say don't do it. He's a guy
[01:45:55] that would say don't do it. It's don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do what people do. Don't do drugs.
[01:46:00] Yeah. Stay clean. Stay clean. There you go. In addition to that, we got another book called
[01:46:07] the Discipline equals Freedom Field Manual. And if this is, this is a good point. If you know
[01:46:11] someone that's off the path, right? Like people go off the path in life. And it doesn't take,
[01:46:18] we talked about this last time. It doesn't take, but one step off the path when you're on a slippery slope.
[01:46:23] It's a slippery slope when you step off the path. So if you know someone that
[01:46:28] has taken a step off the path and they're starting to slide down, get them this book to get them
[01:46:33] on the path, the right path. And there's also a chance that the person that stepped off the path
[01:46:42] is you. So get the field manual. It's got the thoughts and actions that are required to be on the right
[01:46:51] path. Make yourself better, faster, stronger, smarter. Anything else? More physically fit.
[01:47:03] And healthier. The audio version that is on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.
[01:47:12] It's not unautable because then you can't have it as an album with tracks, which we obviously
[01:47:16] support. Extreme ownership. First book, I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin. Over a million copies sold.
[01:47:23] That's a lot of copies sold. That's a lot of copies sold. You know how many copies they told us
[01:47:28] would be successful? Because we didn't know anything about the publishing world.
[01:47:32] Wait, what do you mean? When we were getting, when the book was getting ready to come out
[01:47:37] and I would talk to the publisher, Lave and I were talking to the publisher.
[01:47:42] And he says, you know if this is a successful book then you know, it'll really be, it'll be good to see
[01:47:46] blah blah blah. So they like the standard like a certain amount. That's especially when you
[01:47:51] confess it. No, so I said, hey, what? I don't know anything about this. What is considered to be a
[01:47:56] successful book? You know what the number was? 20,000 books. You go to hell. No, because hey,
[01:48:03] you know we're putting 12,000 on this first run and if you sell, if you, you know we'll put
[01:48:07] some more but if you can sell 20,000 books, that's, that's going to be that's a huge success.
[01:48:11] And we will be proud. So here we are. We're one million. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Good job,
[01:48:18] Lave Babin. Good job. Good job both. Yeah. Lave tells a story that we got home from Ramadhi
[01:48:26] and the only time I ever told him anything positive was when we got home, we'd been home for like two
[01:48:30] weeks and I told him the Delta put in a commander. Hey, good job over there. So yeah, we're keep,
[01:48:39] I like to keep it real. Yeah, man. And actually, you know what the good job over there seems real
[01:48:44] simple, but I'm sure in that context, he was probably the most loaded. Yeah. Good job. Anyone's ever heard.
[01:48:50] Yeah. Yeah. I believe you're correct. Beyond the books and beyond the podcast, also,
[01:48:57] Ashalon front speaking of Lave and me, this is our leadership and management consulting company.
[01:49:02] This is the thing, every, this is a bold statement, right? Every problem in every organization is
[01:49:09] leadership problem. That's a bold statement to make. Yeah. And I'll say again, every problem in every
[01:49:16] organization is a leadership problem. So if there's a problem in an organization, the problem,
[01:49:22] it boils down to leadership on some level. So what we do is we fix the leadership and there,
