1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.56
This is Jocopotcast number 178.

2
00:00:03.56 --> 00:00:06.72
With echo Charles, it me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:06.72 --> 00:00:08.12
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.12 --> 00:00:10.96
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.96 --> 00:00:14.88
Honorable Mother and Father.

6
00:00:14.88 --> 00:00:21.40
The difficulty of the journey you made to see me was clearly evident in your disheveled

7
00:00:21.40 --> 00:00:26.68
hair and in the hollows under your eyes.

8
00:00:26.68 --> 00:00:32.60
It made me want to bend my knees and worship before you.

9
00:00:32.60 --> 00:00:39.92
In the wrinkles on your brows was vivid testimony of the pains you took to raise me.

10
00:00:39.92 --> 00:00:49.56
Words could not express my feelings and what little I did say was superficial in the extreme.

11
00:00:49.56 --> 00:00:54.36
Yet although a cutely conscious of how little time we had, I saw in your eyes and in

12
00:00:54.36 --> 00:01:00.84
your gaze all you wanted to say, but couldn't.

13
00:01:00.84 --> 00:01:06.72
When you took my hand, I experienced a sense of profound peacefulness unlike anything I've

14
00:01:06.72 --> 00:01:13.56
experienced since joining up, like being a baby again and longing for the warmth of a mother's

15
00:01:13.56 --> 00:01:16.000
love.

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.04
It is because I bask in the beauty of your deep devotion that I can margar myself for you.

17
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:31.76
For in death, I will sleep in the world of your love.

18
00:01:31.76 --> 00:01:34.68
Honorable Mother.

19
00:01:34.68 --> 00:01:40.08
Even if I was never able to fully accept the love you gave me, I received so much wisdom

20
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:42.88
from you.

21
00:01:42.88 --> 00:01:50.40
And Father, your silent words are carved deeply into my heart.

22
00:01:50.40 --> 00:01:57.76
If this I will be able to fight together with both of you, even if I should die, it will

23
00:01:57.76 --> 00:02:01.44
be with a peaceful spirit.

24
00:02:01.44 --> 00:02:04.72
I mean this with all my heart.

25
00:02:04.72 --> 00:02:11.32
The war zone is where these beautiful emotions are put to the test.

26
00:02:11.32 --> 00:02:18.84
If death means a return to this world of love, there is no need for me to fear.

27
00:02:18.84 --> 00:02:29.76
There is nothing left to do, but press on, then fulfill my duty.

28
00:02:29.76 --> 00:02:41.88
And that is the final letter written by a man named Captain Adachi Takoya.

29
00:02:41.88 --> 00:02:45.40
It was written obviously to his parents.

30
00:02:45.40 --> 00:02:52.40
And he was assigned to Kamakaze special attack group number one.

31
00:02:52.40 --> 00:02:55.40
And he did carry out his mission.

32
00:02:55.40 --> 00:03:04.68
A suicide attack on one of the US Navy vessels in the vicinity of Okinawa on 28 April 1945.

33
00:03:04.68 --> 00:03:12.92
He was 23 years old, which is actually pretty old for a Kamakaze.

34
00:03:12.92 --> 00:03:16.28
There is another last letter home.

35
00:03:16.28 --> 00:03:23.80
This one's from Ensin Kiyoshi Agawa, Father and Mother.

36
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:30.68
It has been decided that I also will make a swordie as a proud special attack core member.

37
00:03:30.68 --> 00:03:35.56
Looking back when I think of your raising me in your arms for more than 20 years, I am

38
00:03:35.56 --> 00:03:38.44
filled with a sense of gratitude.

39
00:03:38.44 --> 00:03:43.28
I truly believe that no one else has lived at happier life than me, and I am resolved

40
00:03:43.28 --> 00:03:49.68
to repay the emperor and my father for your kindness.

41
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:56.84
Beyond those boundless white clouds, I will make my attack with a calm feeling.

42
00:03:56.84 --> 00:04:00.36
Not even thoughts of life and death will come to my mind.

43
00:04:00.36 --> 00:04:03.96
A person dies once.

44
00:04:03.96 --> 00:04:11.08
It will be an honorable day to live for the eternal cause.

45
00:04:11.08 --> 00:04:17.48
Father and Mother, please be glad for me.

46
00:04:17.48 --> 00:04:21.76
Above all, Mother, please take care of your health.

47
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:27.12
And I wish for everyone's prosperity.

48
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:32.68
Father and Mother, I always and forever will be living near you.

49
00:04:32.68 --> 00:04:35.52
I will be praying.

50
00:04:35.52 --> 00:04:46.04
I will go smiling both on the day of my swordie and forever.

51
00:04:46.04 --> 00:04:56.32
And Ensin Ogawa was the pilot of the second plane to hit the USS bunker hill.

52
00:04:56.32 --> 00:05:05.24
And that Kamikaze attack killed 393 and wounded 264 and took the aircraft carrier out of

53
00:05:05.24 --> 00:05:10.88
commission for the duration of the war.

54
00:05:10.88 --> 00:05:14.72
Most of the Kamikaze were young.

55
00:05:14.72 --> 00:05:21.20
They were sometimes 17, but usually 1819, maybe 20 years old.

56
00:05:21.20 --> 00:05:25.12
They all wrote final letters home.

57
00:05:25.12 --> 00:05:32.16
All letters generally spoke of their commitment to the Emperor, their commitment to the

58
00:05:32.16 --> 00:05:34.64
Japan, their commitment to their parents.

59
00:05:34.64 --> 00:05:39.64
And there's a lot of these letters.

60
00:05:39.64 --> 00:05:40.88
There's thousands of them.

61
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:45.68
And it's actually when you sit there and read them, it's actually kind of seconding

62
00:05:45.68 --> 00:05:46.80
to read these letters.

63
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:52.88
These young boys, they're brainwashed.

64
00:05:52.88 --> 00:06:02.40
I know some people find some level of honor in the Kamikaze pilots.

65
00:06:02.40 --> 00:06:05.40
They sacrificed for their country.

66
00:06:05.40 --> 00:06:08.64
They put service above themselves for their Emperor.

67
00:06:08.64 --> 00:06:15.28
I've hard time with that.

68
00:06:15.28 --> 00:06:16.48
These are kids, right?

69
00:06:16.48 --> 00:06:19.12
These are pawns.

70
00:06:19.12 --> 00:06:22.56
And actually they weren't even that effective.

71
00:06:22.56 --> 00:06:29.56
They had a hit ratio of about 14%.

72
00:06:29.56 --> 00:06:35.08
There was 2,800 Kamikaze pilots that were killed.

73
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:43.000
And they killed about 4,900 sailors, US Navy sailors.

74
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.08
And God bless all those brave sailors.

75
00:06:46.08 --> 00:06:53.08
Every one of those losses and deaths is a tragedy.

76
00:06:53.08 --> 00:07:00.52
And the US Navy in World War II and the Navy in general in World War II was a nightmare.

77
00:07:00.52 --> 00:07:13.20
The Kamikaze sank 34 ships, which is horrible, but it actually wasn't a game changer.

78
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:20.20
But these suicide bombers, you know, you've got to think about how they ended up in that

79
00:07:20.20 --> 00:07:21.20
situation.

80
00:07:21.20 --> 00:07:23.76
And I don't like suicide bombers at all.

81
00:07:23.76 --> 00:07:28.76
And I guess I have a biased against suicide bombers.

82
00:07:28.76 --> 00:07:29.76
Fine.

83
00:07:29.76 --> 00:07:33.56
There was a lot of suicide bombers in Ramadi.

84
00:07:33.56 --> 00:07:38.000
And some people, like I said, some people trying to glorify a suicide bomber, whether

85
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.64
it's a Kamikaze, or whether it's a modern day, suicide bomber.

86
00:07:41.64 --> 00:07:44.60
They tried to glorify them, but there's no glory.

87
00:07:44.60 --> 00:07:54.000
The modern suicide bombers are either cowards that are afraid to face their enemies in

88
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.24
battle.

89
00:07:56.24 --> 00:07:59.40
And what's really sad is that's rare.

90
00:07:59.40 --> 00:08:06.20
More than likely, the modern suicide bomber that you're dealing with is an actual victim,

91
00:08:06.20 --> 00:08:15.76
himself, who is usually a young kid, been manipulated and lied to and or, or I should say,

92
00:08:15.76 --> 00:08:19.96
also coerced through threats.

93
00:08:19.96 --> 00:08:21.60
And that happened all the time.

94
00:08:21.60 --> 00:08:24.32
It was like, hey, if you don't carry out this suicide mission, we're going to kill

95
00:08:24.32 --> 00:08:26.64
your family.

96
00:08:26.64 --> 00:08:31.72
And so you might as well, you might as well do it.

97
00:08:31.72 --> 00:08:34.80
So that's what you're dealing with.

98
00:08:34.80 --> 00:08:38.000
But some of them, you know, sometimes people just get straight up brainwashed.

99
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.64
And it's the same thing with the Japanese Kamikaze's.

100
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:49.36
I would say a lot less on the coercion side.

101
00:08:49.36 --> 00:08:52.24
You know, like, it wasn't like they were holding their family, but they did a great

102
00:08:52.24 --> 00:08:59.92
job of brainwashed these kids.

103
00:08:59.92 --> 00:09:03.60
And I'm no expert.

104
00:09:03.60 --> 00:09:05.08
I should have said that straight out of the gate.

105
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:10.000
I'm just giving you my opinion, my, my thoughts about it.

106
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.56
There's some Japanese documents that I think paint a pretty clear picture of kind

107
00:09:19.56 --> 00:09:25.24
of the, the foundation of what the Japanese military was taught.

108
00:09:25.24 --> 00:09:27.80
And it's why they were, why they fought to the death.

109
00:09:27.80 --> 00:09:30.60
And there's a lot of propaganda that you can look at too.

110
00:09:30.60 --> 00:09:35.96
The propaganda that, you know, explains Americans as these evil people that were going

111
00:09:35.96 --> 00:09:39.68
to come and rape their women and knew it's better to die.

112
00:09:39.68 --> 00:09:40.52
So there's that.

113
00:09:40.52 --> 00:09:48.72
But there's, there's a more foundational thing I think that was printed in World War

114
00:09:48.72 --> 00:09:49.72
II.

115
00:09:49.72 --> 00:09:55.96
And it was called the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors.

116
00:09:55.96 --> 00:09:58.92
And a rescript is like an official guidance.

117
00:09:58.92 --> 00:10:03.12
It's like this is the word from the boss.

118
00:10:03.12 --> 00:10:08.92
And it included in it something called the Sengikan, which, which meant instructions for

119
00:10:08.92 --> 00:10:10.48
the battlefield.

120
00:10:10.48 --> 00:10:17.52
And which we're about this document is it's got a lot of really, a lot of stuff in it

121
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:23.40
that's when you hear it, it sounds, for like a little better word, it sounds good.

122
00:10:23.40 --> 00:10:28.60
The kind of thing that you think, oh, wow, that's, that's, that's honorable, that's good.

123
00:10:28.60 --> 00:10:33.08
It's very idealistic.

124
00:10:33.08 --> 00:10:38.84
And, and I think if this document, this Imperial rescript to Soldiers and Sailors, if it

125
00:10:38.84 --> 00:10:43.48
actually would have been followed, the, a lot of the problems, a lot of the atrocities that

126
00:10:43.48 --> 00:10:47.64
were committed wouldn't happen.

127
00:10:47.64 --> 00:10:58.56
Because the document, as you're going to hear, is a, is a, it's a fairly positive document.

128
00:10:58.56 --> 00:11:05.84
And I think sometimes people take and they hold up that attitude, that kind of

129
00:11:05.84 --> 00:11:09.52
Bushido attitude and hold it up on a pedestal.

130
00:11:09.52 --> 00:11:15.32
And like I said, I get it because when you, when you look at it on its own, you think, wow,

131
00:11:15.32 --> 00:11:17.48
this is, this is a good thing.

132
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:21.32
This is a positive thing.

133
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:29.20
But what you can't forget is that it's this attitude of, this attitude and this culture

134
00:11:29.20 --> 00:11:34.16
of extreme obedience, right, extreme obedience.

135
00:11:34.16 --> 00:11:38.52
I talk all the time about how you've got to question your leaders, right?

136
00:11:38.52 --> 00:11:43.56
And I talk all the time how if, if you're told to do something that's unethical or illegal

137
00:11:43.56 --> 00:11:50.88
or immoral, it is your obligation and your duty to disobey.

138
00:11:50.88 --> 00:11:52.80
So they, they didn't have that attitude.

139
00:11:52.80 --> 00:11:56.24
Their attitude was 100% obedience.

140
00:11:56.24 --> 00:12:01.84
They also had the strong attitude of ethnic superiority.

141
00:12:01.84 --> 00:12:08.16
So they, the Japanese people thought that their race and their ethnicity was superior to

142
00:12:08.16 --> 00:12:11.40
everyone else's.

143
00:12:11.40 --> 00:12:17.28
And that attitude led to things like these common, common cause, pilots.

144
00:12:17.28 --> 00:12:27.000
And it led to atrocities like the raponang king and like unit 731, a just horror, horror

145
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.32
show atrocities with the darkest evil imaginable.

146
00:12:34.32 --> 00:12:45.16
And you know, podcast 60, raponang king, podcast 133, unit 731.

147
00:12:45.16 --> 00:12:49.92
If you listen to those, you don't, you can't listen to those and feel normal when you're

148
00:12:49.92 --> 00:12:50.76
done listening to it.

149
00:12:50.76 --> 00:12:54.40
You can't.

150
00:12:54.40 --> 00:13:05.32
They're disturbing to listen to when you see how evil human beings can be to other human beings.

151
00:13:05.32 --> 00:13:16.60
So like I said, when you hear this imperial rescript, it, it sounds positive.

152
00:13:16.60 --> 00:13:22.92
A lot of it sounds good, but first of all, it wasn't followed.

153
00:13:22.92 --> 00:13:27.72
Because some, some of the positive parts of the code that they clearly did not listen

154
00:13:27.72 --> 00:13:29.36
to.

155
00:13:29.36 --> 00:13:35.88
And then other parts of the code that are positive, like anything that's positive, if you

156
00:13:35.88 --> 00:13:39.32
let it go too far, then it becomes a negative.

157
00:13:39.32 --> 00:13:47.44
And that's seems to me what happened, at least in some sense an imperial Japan.

158
00:13:47.44 --> 00:13:54.08
So I think this document kind of reveals how they framed their mindset.

159
00:13:54.08 --> 00:13:58.56
And there's like I said, there's lessons in here to learn and think about things that

160
00:13:58.56 --> 00:14:04.48
you can take away that you say, that's a good policy.

161
00:14:04.48 --> 00:14:11.36
But you can also see that when it's taken to the extreme, it becomes the framework for

162
00:14:11.36 --> 00:14:17.28
imperial Japan to become the sadistic evil that they originally believed they were fighting

163
00:14:17.28 --> 00:14:18.28
against.

164
00:14:18.28 --> 00:14:24.44
So let's get into it the imperial rescript to soldiers and sailor sailors.

165
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:26.08
Here we go, introduction.

166
00:14:26.08 --> 00:14:32.84
The battle is where the imperial army acting under the imperial command displays its true

167
00:14:32.84 --> 00:14:36.56
character conquering.

168
00:14:36.56 --> 00:14:43.40
Whenever it attacks, winning whenever it engages in combat in order to spread codeau.

169
00:14:43.40 --> 00:14:47.04
And so codeau is the imperial way.

170
00:14:47.04 --> 00:14:48.04
That's what it means.

171
00:14:48.04 --> 00:14:49.60
And that's how they describe it.

172
00:14:49.60 --> 00:14:54.68
But what's interesting is it literally means like a fragrance, like a smell.

173
00:14:54.68 --> 00:14:58.20
So it's like the scent, the spirit, the heartbeat.

174
00:14:58.20 --> 00:14:59.52
So that's what codeau is.

175
00:14:59.52 --> 00:15:04.36
They want to spread the codeau far and wide so that the enemy may look up in awe to the

176
00:15:04.36 --> 00:15:08.76
august virtues of his majesty.

177
00:15:08.76 --> 00:15:14.08
Those who marched to the battlefield, therefore should endeavor to exalt throughout the world.

178
00:15:14.08 --> 00:15:20.04
The glories of the empire by fully realizing what the country stands for and firmly upholding

179
00:15:20.04 --> 00:15:24.36
the moral tenets of the imperial army.

180
00:15:24.36 --> 00:15:29.28
The imperial rescript to the armed forces is explicit.

181
00:15:29.28 --> 00:15:34.08
While regulations and manuals clearly defined conduct and combat and methods of training,

182
00:15:34.08 --> 00:15:39.56
conditions in the combat zone, however tend to cause soldiers to be swayed by immediate

183
00:15:39.56 --> 00:15:43.64
events and become forgetful of their duty.

184
00:15:43.64 --> 00:15:47.000
Indeed they should be wary.

185
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.04
Indeed they should be wary there, less they run counter to their duties as soldiers.

186
00:15:52.04 --> 00:15:58.000
The purpose of this code lies in providing concrete rules of conduct in the light of past

187
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.60
experience so that those in the zone of combat may wholly abide by the imperial rescript

188
00:16:04.60 --> 00:16:11.000
to enhance the moral virtues of the imperial army.

189
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.76
So hey, combat's going to be tough and you may forget your morals that they're talking

190
00:16:17.76 --> 00:16:24.20
about moral virtues and so we're saying hey, combat's going to be hard.

191
00:16:24.20 --> 00:16:28.36
It's going to be chaotic and when you get in that tough situation, you may forget your

192
00:16:28.36 --> 00:16:32.000
morals and so this guide right here is going to help you keep you on track.

193
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.16
That's what it's going to do.

194
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:34.72
That's the idea here.

195
00:16:34.72 --> 00:16:38.44
Chapter one, the empire.

196
00:16:38.44 --> 00:16:45.44
Japan is the cocoa coup, which means the empire.

197
00:16:45.44 --> 00:16:51.64
The tenu, which is the Emperor of Japan, rules over it ever lastingly in a line unbroken

198
00:16:51.64 --> 00:16:57.000
through the ages as the successor in the high and broad cause established by the imperial

199
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.52
ancestor at the time of the founding of the empire.

200
00:17:01.52 --> 00:17:07.52
Imperial benevolence is extended to all without favor while the imperial virtues in light

201
00:17:07.52 --> 00:17:09.68
in the world.

202
00:17:09.68 --> 00:17:18.08
The people to handing down from traditions of loyalty, filial piety and valor from generation

203
00:17:18.08 --> 00:17:27.48
to generation and enhancing thereby their moral peculiar to the empire have assisted the

204
00:17:27.48 --> 00:17:34.20
throne, a perfect national unity under the throne, which has brought about the present

205
00:17:34.20 --> 00:17:36.56
national prosperity.

206
00:17:36.56 --> 00:17:40.68
They go back to a racial thing.

207
00:17:40.68 --> 00:17:50.80
This is an unbroken, unbroken line of royalty, per thousands of years.

208
00:17:50.80 --> 00:17:54.92
That's why we're here and they've been so benevolent.

209
00:17:54.92 --> 00:17:58.44
That's why we're living a good life right now.

210
00:17:58.44 --> 00:18:02.72
Soldiers on the field should seek to achieve with unshakable determination their mission

211
00:18:02.72 --> 00:18:09.96
of defending the empire by laying to heart the essential character of the national policy.

212
00:18:09.96 --> 00:18:16.96
The army under command of the emperor assists in furthering the imperial fortunes by enhancing

213
00:18:16.96 --> 00:18:24.12
the glories of the empire through the embodiment of the lofty spirit of valor.

214
00:18:24.12 --> 00:18:28.04
This spirit is the basic factor in realizing universal peace.

215
00:18:28.04 --> 00:18:33.16
We're fighting for peace over here. That's what we're doing. For this spirit of justice

216
00:18:33.16 --> 00:18:40.44
combined with valor and of valor tampered by benevolence in conformity with the imperial

217
00:18:40.44 --> 00:18:41.44
wishes.

218
00:18:41.44 --> 00:18:43.04
This is all good.

219
00:18:43.04 --> 00:18:44.24
That's where we're at.

220
00:18:44.24 --> 00:18:45.24
This is all good.

221
00:18:45.24 --> 00:18:46.84
This is a benevolent leader.

222
00:18:46.84 --> 00:18:53.68
You've got the spirit of the army is actually just the reflection, the arm of this benevolence

223
00:18:53.68 --> 00:18:57.72
that's going to go out and bring the spirit of peace to the world.

224
00:18:57.72 --> 00:18:58.72
valor.

225
00:18:58.72 --> 00:19:00.68
Then we get into it a little bit.

226
00:19:00.68 --> 00:19:03.32
Valor requires strickeness.

227
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:08.24
While benevolence must be universal, should there be an enemy who dares oppose the imperial

228
00:19:08.24 --> 00:19:09.24
army?

229
00:19:09.24 --> 00:19:15.64
The army must resolutely resort to force of arms and deal him a crushing blow.

230
00:19:15.64 --> 00:19:17.88
We took a little one, 80, I didn't win.

231
00:19:17.88 --> 00:19:21.08
Hey, we're all about getting our peace on.

232
00:19:21.08 --> 00:19:25.60
But if you oppose, if you dare to oppose the imperial army, you can get a crushing

233
00:19:25.60 --> 00:19:26.60
blow.

234
00:19:26.60 --> 00:19:27.60
That's how we're rolling.

235
00:19:27.60 --> 00:19:34.88
However, even though force may compel the enemy to submit, should a lapse of virtue,

236
00:19:34.88 --> 00:19:39.32
should a lapse of invert you occur by the striking of those who do not resist or by failure

237
00:19:39.32 --> 00:19:45.68
to show kindness to those who surrender, it cannot be said that such an army is perfect.

238
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:49.96
So there we got, we're going to take care of the people that if you surrender, you're

239
00:19:49.96 --> 00:19:51.76
good.

240
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:54.52
If you don't resist, you won't be harmed, right?

241
00:19:54.52 --> 00:19:56.80
So we're like a benevolent army.

242
00:19:56.80 --> 00:20:00.000
If you stand up to us, we're going to crush you, but if not, it's cool.

243
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.68
We're going to take care of you.

244
00:20:02.68 --> 00:20:08.96
Here's modest in its strength, unostintacious in its kindness.

245
00:20:08.96 --> 00:20:16.48
The imperial army becomes an objective admiration when it quietly displays its valor

246
00:20:16.48 --> 00:20:17.76
and benevolence.

247
00:20:17.76 --> 00:20:18.76
So here we are.

248
00:20:18.76 --> 00:20:19.76
You know what to say in here?

249
00:20:19.76 --> 00:20:20.76
Gotta be humble.

250
00:20:20.76 --> 00:20:21.76
I say that all the time.

251
00:20:21.76 --> 00:20:22.76
Gotta be humble.

252
00:20:22.76 --> 00:20:23.76
That's what they're saying.

253
00:20:23.76 --> 00:20:25.56
You gotta be modest.

254
00:20:25.56 --> 00:20:29.000
You gotta, you gotta quietly display your strength, right?

255
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Sure.

256
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Just be modest.

257
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.92
We agree with that.

258
00:20:32.92 --> 00:20:38.92
The mission of the imperial army lies in making the imperial virtues, the objects

259
00:20:38.92 --> 00:20:46.08
of universal admiration through the exercise of justice tempered with mercy.

260
00:20:46.08 --> 00:20:54.52
Obviously, the folks in the NANDKING did not get this message.

261
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:55.52
They were disciplined.

262
00:20:55.52 --> 00:20:59.04
And actually, they truly didn't because of this, this wasn't released when the

263
00:20:59.04 --> 00:21:00.44
RAPINAN KING took place.

264
00:21:00.44 --> 00:21:01.76
This hadn't come out yet.

265
00:21:01.76 --> 00:21:07.72
So they truly did not get the memo of this at that time.

266
00:21:07.72 --> 00:21:10.04
Discipline.

267
00:21:10.04 --> 00:21:15.68
The essence of discipline in the imperial army lies in the lofty spirit of complete obedience

268
00:21:15.68 --> 00:21:20.44
to his majesty.

269
00:21:20.44 --> 00:21:21.80
There you go.

270
00:21:21.80 --> 00:21:26.52
The essence of discipline in the imperial army lies in the lofty spirit of complete obedience

271
00:21:26.52 --> 00:21:27.52
to his majesty.

272
00:21:27.52 --> 00:21:35.48
High and low must have deeply engraved in their minds, the solemnly of the right of command.

273
00:21:35.48 --> 00:21:39.92
Those above who should exercise the right in all seriousness while those below should obey

274
00:21:39.92 --> 00:21:44.36
the commands in utmost sincerity.

275
00:21:44.36 --> 00:21:49.000
Essential of victory and requisite for maintaining peace is the condition where in the

276
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.44
entire army united in the bonds of absolute loyalty moves as one in response to a command.

277
00:21:57.44 --> 00:22:00.28
So this is where we're getting into it.

278
00:22:00.28 --> 00:22:06.76
Even the US military, you've got to obey the lawful orders of the people appointed above

279
00:22:06.76 --> 00:22:07.76
you.

280
00:22:07.76 --> 00:22:08.76
The lawful orders.

281
00:22:08.76 --> 00:22:12.76
That's the oath that you swear is that you obey the lawful orders.

282
00:22:12.76 --> 00:22:18.68
Doesn't just say, oh, bay, especially on the battlefield is the utmost

283
00:22:18.68 --> 00:22:22.000
observance of the spirit of obedience necessary.

284
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.08
The spirit of the soldier's bestics exemplified by those who silently do their duty, joyfully

285
00:22:28.08 --> 00:22:33.72
braving death in obedience to a command given at a time when they are undergoing great

286
00:22:33.72 --> 00:22:34.72
hardships.

287
00:22:34.72 --> 00:22:42.20
There's no more important time that you need to obey than on the battlefield.

288
00:22:42.20 --> 00:22:50.44
The next section, unity, the army looks up in awe to his majesty as its august head.

289
00:22:50.44 --> 00:22:57.88
It will be united in compliance with the imperial will as one in spirit and in body and

290
00:22:57.88 --> 00:23:02.04
in single-hearted loyalty.

291
00:23:02.04 --> 00:23:06.68
In keeping with the basic principles of command and army units should form a solid yet

292
00:23:06.68 --> 00:23:12.000
genial group with its commander as its center.

293
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.88
It is essential that each man, high and low, doodifully observing his place, should be determined

294
00:23:17.88 --> 00:23:23.64
always to sacrifice himself for the whole in accordance with the intentions of the commander

295
00:23:23.64 --> 00:23:29.68
by reposing every confidence in his comrades and without giving even the slightest thought

296
00:23:29.68 --> 00:23:36.16
to personal interest and to life or death.

297
00:23:36.16 --> 00:23:43.000
So hey, I'm a firm believer.

298
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
In fact I think that's what makes a good team player is someone that puts the team above

299
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.96
themselves.

300
00:23:49.96 --> 00:23:52.32
No doubt about that's also what makes a good leader.

301
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:58.24
Someone that puts the team's mission and the people on the team above themselves.

302
00:23:58.24 --> 00:24:01.92
That's I agree with that.

303
00:24:01.92 --> 00:24:08.24
I guess we're going a little next level here, maybe a little bit.

304
00:24:08.24 --> 00:24:12.52
You got to see, here's the difference, I think, it's in this word determined to always

305
00:24:12.52 --> 00:24:14.48
to sacrifice for yourself for the whole.

306
00:24:14.48 --> 00:24:16.04
That's going to the next level, right?

307
00:24:16.04 --> 00:24:17.64
It's not like, hey, I'm putting the team first.

308
00:24:17.64 --> 00:24:20.08
It's like my goal is to sacrifice myself for the team.

309
00:24:20.08 --> 00:24:21.08
That's where I'm head.

310
00:24:21.08 --> 00:24:22.80
That's what I'm trying to make happen.

311
00:24:22.80 --> 00:24:24.08
That's a little different.

312
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:27.68
That's the little next level.

313
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:29.40
Cooperation, next section cooperation.

314
00:24:29.40 --> 00:24:35.12
Oldiers not only should be united in mind in carrying out their tasks, but should also

315
00:24:35.12 --> 00:24:41.48
display the spirit of cooperation by forgetting themselves for the sake of victory.

316
00:24:41.48 --> 00:24:46.40
Every unit should carry out its mission with responsibility upholding its honor, placing

317
00:24:46.40 --> 00:24:53.20
confidence in others, and assisting one another, volunteering to face hardships, exerting

318
00:24:53.20 --> 00:25:01.12
all its strength and cooperation and fighting valiantly to achieve its objective.

319
00:25:01.12 --> 00:25:03.56
Teamwork.

320
00:25:03.56 --> 00:25:04.92
That's what we're saying.

321
00:25:04.92 --> 00:25:07.32
We're talking about teamwork.

322
00:25:07.32 --> 00:25:10.60
We are going a little next level here because we're talking about forgetting yourselves

323
00:25:10.60 --> 00:25:14.16
for the sake of victory.

324
00:25:14.16 --> 00:25:18.32
That's a little next level.

325
00:25:18.32 --> 00:25:21.92
Volunteering to face hardships while everyone does that in the military.

326
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:25.12
Being strengthened cooperation, yes, everyone does that in the military.

327
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:26.76
Fighting valiantly to achieve its objective.

328
00:25:26.76 --> 00:25:30.72
Yes, everyone does that in the military.

329
00:25:30.72 --> 00:25:36.40
But forgetting yourself for the sake of victory, that's again.

330
00:25:36.40 --> 00:25:39.20
This is like, hey, I'm putting the team and the mission above me.

331
00:25:39.20 --> 00:25:41.28
I get that.

332
00:25:41.28 --> 00:25:43.68
We're not going to forget ourselves though.

333
00:25:43.68 --> 00:25:47.64
We're not just saying, okay, I don't exist.

334
00:25:47.64 --> 00:25:53.28
We're not giving up our personal spirit for the collective spirit.

335
00:25:53.28 --> 00:25:54.68
We're not doing that.

336
00:25:54.68 --> 00:25:57.68
We're only just reefers that we're not doing that in America.

337
00:25:57.68 --> 00:26:00.08
That's not what we're doing.

338
00:26:00.08 --> 00:26:02.28
We join together the collective spirit.

339
00:26:02.28 --> 00:26:05.72
We're not giving up ours.

340
00:26:05.72 --> 00:26:08.28
Next section, aggressiveness.

341
00:26:08.28 --> 00:26:11.52
Can't argue with aggressiveness.

342
00:26:11.52 --> 00:26:16.76
Aggressiveness should constantly prevail in combat, which must be carried out with bravery

343
00:26:16.76 --> 00:26:18.32
and determination.

344
00:26:18.32 --> 00:26:23.96
When attacking, be determined and positive, always taking the initiative, fighting vigorously

345
00:26:23.96 --> 00:26:28.84
and stubbornly vowing not to cease until the enemy is crushed.

346
00:26:28.84 --> 00:26:32.68
I got no issues with that.

347
00:26:32.68 --> 00:26:38.84
In defense, always retain the spirit of attack and always maintain freedom of action.

348
00:26:38.84 --> 00:26:41.08
Never give up a position.

349
00:26:41.08 --> 00:26:44.000
But rather die.

350
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.96
And pursuit be thorough and inexorable.

351
00:26:48.96 --> 00:26:52.76
So, yep, never give up position.

352
00:26:52.76 --> 00:26:54.48
It's better to die.

353
00:26:54.48 --> 00:26:59.24
And I think we talked about what we've definitely talked about that on the podcast.

354
00:26:59.24 --> 00:27:02.24
When is it intelligent to make a tactical retreat?

355
00:27:02.24 --> 00:27:05.08
There are times without question.

356
00:27:05.08 --> 00:27:09.44
And there's been times throughout history where tactical retreats, giving up positions

357
00:27:09.44 --> 00:27:13.96
has caused victory.

358
00:27:13.96 --> 00:27:17.80
The Imperial Japanese Army is not talking about that.

359
00:27:17.80 --> 00:27:21.88
They're talking about it's better to die.

360
00:27:21.88 --> 00:27:26.68
Continue on, act boldly, intent upon victory.

361
00:27:26.68 --> 00:27:28.52
Be fearless and calm.

362
00:27:28.52 --> 00:27:33.44
Meeting the situation courageously undergoing hardships with indomitable perseverance

363
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:35.44
so as to overcome all obstacles.

364
00:27:35.44 --> 00:27:44.68
Hey, I'm good with that, right?

365
00:27:44.68 --> 00:27:46.12
That's what you got to do.

366
00:27:46.12 --> 00:27:49.52
Indomitable perseverance, overcome all obstacles.

367
00:27:49.52 --> 00:27:53.32
Good, the next section, conviction to win.

368
00:27:53.32 --> 00:27:56.32
Faith is strength.

369
00:27:56.32 --> 00:28:00.68
He who has faith in combat is always the victor.

370
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:05.40
The conviction to win grows from constant and rigorous training.

371
00:28:05.40 --> 00:28:12.16
Help the strength to conquer the enemy by every possible effort and by improving every moment.

372
00:28:12.16 --> 00:28:14.44
Got no issues with that?

373
00:28:14.44 --> 00:28:15.44
Get better?

374
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:16.44
Yeah, train hard.

375
00:28:16.44 --> 00:28:21.12
Rigorous, rigorous training is definitely going to get you ready for tough situations.

376
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:25.92
You got to have faith in what you're doing for sure.

377
00:28:25.92 --> 00:28:30.32
The destiny of the Empire, Ress upon victory or defeat in battle.

378
00:28:30.32 --> 00:28:34.36
It's a heavy weight to bear.

379
00:28:34.36 --> 00:28:40.34
You not give up under any circumstances, keeping in your mind your responsibility to keep

380
00:28:40.34 --> 00:28:47.72
untarnished the glorious history of the Imperial Army with its tradition of invincibility.

381
00:28:47.72 --> 00:28:53.40
Yeah, that one's a stretch.

382
00:28:53.40 --> 00:29:02.44
We're taking a stretch now because I promise you the no man and no army is invincible.

383
00:29:02.44 --> 00:29:05.96
So again, it'll stretch there.

384
00:29:05.96 --> 00:29:10.60
Going a little too deep.

385
00:29:10.60 --> 00:29:18.52
Next section, chapter two and part one is called Piety.

386
00:29:18.52 --> 00:29:23.40
The gods look upon us from above.

387
00:29:23.40 --> 00:29:30.42
Be worthy of divine protection by being pure and heart, just an action, profound and

388
00:29:30.42 --> 00:29:39.98
sincere in your Piety, constantly mindful of the loyalty you owe the Emperor and of duty

389
00:29:39.98 --> 00:29:43.58
to your parents.

390
00:29:43.58 --> 00:29:51.10
So we're talking, that's the first most important thing is your devotion to the Emperor.

391
00:29:51.10 --> 00:29:53.94
That's the most important thing that we're talking about.

392
00:29:53.94 --> 00:30:02.06
The gods look upon you from above, the gods are related to the Emperor.

393
00:30:02.06 --> 00:30:07.86
The next section is Filiol Piety.

394
00:30:07.86 --> 00:30:13.26
So now we're talking about reverence of our parents, loyalty and Filiol Piety as one formed

395
00:30:13.26 --> 00:30:17.66
the essence of our national morality.

396
00:30:17.66 --> 00:30:22.18
The loyal subject is always a beautiful son.

397
00:30:22.18 --> 00:30:27.86
The devoured man of fast, the best traditions of our forefathers by bearing in mind the

398
00:30:27.86 --> 00:30:37.58
wishes of your parents thereby fulfilling the sacred duty of a loyal subject on the battlefield.

399
00:30:37.58 --> 00:30:41.46
Hey, respect your parents, I can get behind that.

400
00:30:41.46 --> 00:30:45.02
Nothing wrong with that.

401
00:30:45.02 --> 00:30:47.66
Trying to be a good kid, sure.

402
00:30:47.66 --> 00:30:50.26
No objections.

403
00:30:50.26 --> 00:30:57.62
The Luts and Manors, the salute is the expression of a sincere feeling of obedience.

404
00:30:57.62 --> 00:31:02.10
And is also a symbol of unity between those above and those below.

405
00:31:02.10 --> 00:31:05.54
Salutes must be strictly executed on the field.

406
00:31:05.54 --> 00:31:10.94
If a soldier is filled with a sense of decorum and strict in practicing good manners, it shows

407
00:31:10.94 --> 00:31:12.66
that he is a strong warrior.

408
00:31:12.66 --> 00:31:14.14
To me, this is weird.

409
00:31:14.14 --> 00:31:25.78
Because Salutes are a definitely a time-honored military tradition throughout the world.

410
00:31:25.78 --> 00:31:30.30
And in the US military, you don't salute a lot in the field for sure.

411
00:31:30.30 --> 00:31:31.74
In the sealed teams, you don't salute.

412
00:31:31.74 --> 00:31:35.06
I mean, very rarely, there's not a lot of saluting going on, basically because you're

413
00:31:35.06 --> 00:31:39.02
not walking around when uniform all the time.

414
00:31:39.02 --> 00:31:41.78
So there's not a lot of saluting going on.

415
00:31:41.78 --> 00:31:47.18
But yeah, so there's a lot of different ways to show respect.

416
00:31:47.18 --> 00:31:51.26
And saluting is sort of the most visible, I guess, why?

417
00:31:51.26 --> 00:31:54.42
But it's just kind of interesting to me that they're so into it.

418
00:31:54.42 --> 00:31:56.18
Let me put it to this way.

419
00:31:56.18 --> 00:32:03.42
This is, you know, when you see like a military movie, which I'm sure you've seen some,

420
00:32:03.42 --> 00:32:04.62
yes sir.

421
00:32:04.62 --> 00:32:08.82
When you see like the new guy officer, and he says, hey, you better give me a salute

422
00:32:08.82 --> 00:32:13.94
sergeant, right? And everyone knows that that guy's not a good leader immediately, right?

423
00:32:13.94 --> 00:32:16.46
Because you don't get all freaked out because someone doesn't salute you the way they

424
00:32:16.46 --> 00:32:17.46
should.

425
00:32:17.46 --> 00:32:22.50
So now we have the whole military is acting like that.

426
00:32:22.50 --> 00:32:25.22
The whole Japanese military is like, hey, you better salute.

427
00:32:25.22 --> 00:32:27.10
That to me is a little bit.

428
00:32:27.10 --> 00:32:29.34
And I get it, right?

429
00:32:29.34 --> 00:32:31.58
It's the military tradition.

430
00:32:31.58 --> 00:32:34.02
It is, it's not a show of obedience.

431
00:32:34.02 --> 00:32:35.58
As far as I'm concerned, it's a respectful thing.

432
00:32:35.58 --> 00:32:40.22
Like, hey, you know, there you are, you're a senior officer or whatever, boom, you crack this

433
00:32:40.22 --> 00:32:41.22
salute.

434
00:32:41.22 --> 00:32:42.22
It's all good.

435
00:32:42.22 --> 00:32:50.98
Isn't it like a symbol of just extreme discipline, like, no your place, like, no your

436
00:32:50.98 --> 00:32:53.70
role, no your place?

437
00:32:53.70 --> 00:32:55.50
It does, I guess, signify that.

438
00:32:55.50 --> 00:32:58.50
But really, it's just about respect as far as I'm concerned.

439
00:32:58.50 --> 00:33:03.06
Boom, you see someone that senior to you, boom, you crack a salute, all good.

440
00:33:03.06 --> 00:33:10.78
Right, but it's like the kind of the functional use of that respect is like, you know,

441
00:33:10.78 --> 00:33:14.38
I'm gonna come, I'm gonna, you know, appear before you kind of thing.

442
00:33:14.38 --> 00:33:18.62
And it's basically recognizing, hey, I'm being if you, you're above me, you know, this

443
00:33:18.62 --> 00:33:21.70
is how we're functioning together right now.

444
00:33:21.70 --> 00:33:24.70
Yeah, there's my, you know, a firm, what do you call it?

445
00:33:24.70 --> 00:33:25.70
Confucianian.

446
00:33:25.70 --> 00:33:26.70
Confucianian.

447
00:33:26.70 --> 00:33:27.70
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:33:27.70 --> 00:33:29.98
There is a, that's there.

449
00:33:29.98 --> 00:33:34.62
And it's a way, to me, it's all about tradition and respect, more than anything else.

450
00:33:34.62 --> 00:33:35.62
Yeah.

451
00:33:35.62 --> 00:33:37.10
You know, that's what it is.

452
00:33:37.10 --> 00:33:38.62
It's about tradition and respect.

453
00:33:38.62 --> 00:33:42.66
You know, you see someone that's senior, you know, an officer, if you're an

454
00:33:42.66 --> 00:33:45.34
enlisted guy, you salute all the officers, boom, get them up.

455
00:33:45.34 --> 00:33:46.70
That's the way it is.

456
00:33:46.70 --> 00:33:54.78
But it's, yeah, to me, it's not like this crazy thing, like I never yelled at anyone

457
00:33:54.78 --> 00:33:56.42
for not saluting me, right?

458
00:33:56.42 --> 00:33:57.42
Yeah.

459
00:33:57.42 --> 00:34:02.46
You know, and you probably couldn't find a lot of seals that would that have done

460
00:34:02.46 --> 00:34:03.46
that.

461
00:34:03.46 --> 00:34:08.22
Now, could you say that, oh, this, there's, you know, you could see some kid that's

462
00:34:08.22 --> 00:34:12.42
being legitimately trying to be disrespectful, right?

463
00:34:12.42 --> 00:34:14.14
Yeah.

464
00:34:14.14 --> 00:34:17.50
And maybe that person could get tightened up.

465
00:34:17.50 --> 00:34:18.50
Yeah.

466
00:34:18.50 --> 00:34:23.34
But, yeah, like on a few good men, remember when he's like, hey, whatever happened

467
00:34:23.34 --> 00:34:27.42
that's alluding it officer when he leaves the room and then the guy puts his hands in his pocket.

468
00:34:27.42 --> 00:34:28.42
Oh, dang.

469
00:34:28.42 --> 00:34:30.42
Who put their hand in the pocket?

470
00:34:30.42 --> 00:34:36.42
His name was, downy or dogg, dogg, dogg, dogg, and dogg, and dogg.

471
00:34:36.42 --> 00:34:38.58
And who is he doing that, too?

472
00:34:38.58 --> 00:34:39.58
Tom Cruise.

473
00:34:39.58 --> 00:34:41.62
Oh, dang, Tom Cruise wasn't getting the respect.

474
00:34:41.62 --> 00:34:42.62
Correct.

475
00:34:42.62 --> 00:34:43.62
There you go.

476
00:34:43.62 --> 00:34:44.62
Yeah.

477
00:34:44.62 --> 00:34:45.62
There you go.

478
00:34:45.62 --> 00:34:46.62
Good example.

479
00:34:46.62 --> 00:34:47.62
Yeah.

480
00:34:47.62 --> 00:34:49.66
But see what I'm saying though.

481
00:34:49.66 --> 00:34:53.38
It's like, but what is that respect kind of reflecting though?

482
00:34:53.38 --> 00:34:54.62
Overal functionally.

483
00:34:54.62 --> 00:34:55.62
It does seem like that.

484
00:34:55.62 --> 00:35:00.14
It's like, okay, knowing your place, I'm here to kind of recognize that.

485
00:35:00.14 --> 00:35:04.58
Just in the small detailed way that apparently will be unnecessary in certain scenarios.

486
00:35:04.58 --> 00:35:05.58
Yeah.

487
00:35:05.58 --> 00:35:08.58
And I guess, I guess what you're actually talking about, it's just good order and discipline.

488
00:35:08.58 --> 00:35:09.58
Yeah.

489
00:35:09.58 --> 00:35:10.58
Good order in this month.

490
00:35:10.58 --> 00:35:11.58
Yeah.

491
00:35:11.58 --> 00:35:12.58
Like, beginning, and it's okay to do it.

492
00:35:12.58 --> 00:35:13.58
We just have this tradition.

493
00:35:13.58 --> 00:35:14.58
This is what's happening.

494
00:35:14.58 --> 00:35:15.58
Yeah.

495
00:35:15.58 --> 00:35:18.10
Same thing with like, polish shoes or, you know, uniform.

496
00:35:18.10 --> 00:35:19.10
Yeah.

497
00:35:19.10 --> 00:35:20.10
Yeah.

498
00:35:20.10 --> 00:35:21.10
Yeah.

499
00:35:21.10 --> 00:35:22.10
Exactly right.

500
00:35:22.10 --> 00:35:23.10
So it's like there's no questions.

501
00:35:23.10 --> 00:35:24.10
There's no wiggle room or whatever.

502
00:35:24.10 --> 00:35:26.10
Like we're here to do the job like from eight to ten.

503
00:35:26.10 --> 00:35:27.10
Yeah.

504
00:35:27.10 --> 00:35:32.22
And I'm just saying, if you're freaking out about sluts, then you probably need to look at

505
00:35:32.22 --> 00:35:33.98
some other stuff that's going on around you.

506
00:35:33.98 --> 00:35:36.02
You might be freaking out about the wrong thing.

507
00:35:36.02 --> 00:35:38.02
It's all I'm saying.

508
00:35:38.02 --> 00:35:41.98
And if you're good, like if you're a good officer, it's not like people are trying

509
00:35:41.98 --> 00:35:43.62
to avoid saluting you.

510
00:35:43.62 --> 00:35:44.62
Yeah.

511
00:35:44.62 --> 00:35:45.62
They're down.

512
00:35:45.62 --> 00:35:47.30
They're like, you know, hey, here's the salute.

513
00:35:47.30 --> 00:35:48.30
Let's do it.

514
00:35:48.30 --> 00:35:52.30
All right, getting back to the book, the way of comrades and arms, comrades and arms,

515
00:35:52.30 --> 00:35:58.06
united in life and death for the imperial cause should display full mutual trust.

516
00:35:58.06 --> 00:36:02.82
Should always endeavor to improve each other, assist each other in distress and restrain

517
00:36:02.82 --> 00:36:09.94
each other against excesses in order that they may jointly fulfill their duties as soldiers.

518
00:36:09.94 --> 00:36:11.34
It's all solid.

519
00:36:11.34 --> 00:36:13.38
Hey, we're going to trust each other.

520
00:36:13.38 --> 00:36:16.34
We're going to work always to improve each other.

521
00:36:16.34 --> 00:36:18.26
We're going to help each other if we got a problem.

522
00:36:18.26 --> 00:36:19.74
These are all fine.

523
00:36:19.74 --> 00:36:22.58
All good to go.

524
00:36:22.58 --> 00:36:23.58
Initiative.

525
00:36:23.58 --> 00:36:27.18
Next section, initiative in exemplary conduct.

526
00:36:27.18 --> 00:36:30.22
This is interesting because we're not just talking about initiative.

527
00:36:30.22 --> 00:36:31.50
Because initiative is good.

528
00:36:31.50 --> 00:36:32.82
We want people to have initiative.

529
00:36:32.82 --> 00:36:35.90
But this is initiative in exemplary conduct.

530
00:36:35.90 --> 00:36:41.78
Leaders should be zealous in giving a worthy example in everything.

531
00:36:41.78 --> 00:36:47.94
If there is disorder above, those below will be unruly.

532
00:36:47.94 --> 00:36:49.74
Innovation is prized on the field.

533
00:36:49.74 --> 00:36:54.94
Leaders should provide an example by acting more courageously than others.

534
00:36:54.94 --> 00:36:57.50
Yeah, good.

535
00:36:57.50 --> 00:37:02.46
I mean, can't really argue with those.

536
00:37:02.46 --> 00:37:03.82
You've got to have discipline.

537
00:37:03.82 --> 00:37:06.10
You've got to have order.

538
00:37:06.10 --> 00:37:08.14
You've got to set the example.

539
00:37:08.14 --> 00:37:10.02
Can't argue with those.

540
00:37:10.02 --> 00:37:12.46
Next responsibility.

541
00:37:12.46 --> 00:37:16.18
Duty is sacred.

542
00:37:16.18 --> 00:37:23.18
Once responsibility is extremely heavy, each and every task must be performed with the

543
00:37:23.18 --> 00:37:29.50
utmost care until all a field available means are exhausted.

544
00:37:29.50 --> 00:37:39.62
Those who have a strong sense of responsibility are bravest of the brave on the field.

545
00:37:39.62 --> 00:37:40.62
Okay.

546
00:37:40.62 --> 00:37:41.62
Okay.

547
00:37:41.62 --> 00:37:42.86
Duty is sacred.

548
00:37:42.86 --> 00:37:43.86
You got you.

549
00:37:43.86 --> 00:37:47.30
It's a bowl.

550
00:37:47.30 --> 00:37:49.30
You got to be responsible.

551
00:37:49.30 --> 00:37:51.30
You got to take care of what you're doing.

552
00:37:51.30 --> 00:37:53.02
Next one, view of life and death.

553
00:37:53.02 --> 00:37:58.34
The lofty spirit of self-sacrificing service to the state must prevail in life and in

554
00:37:58.34 --> 00:37:59.34
death.

555
00:37:59.34 --> 00:38:03.78
Do your duty with heart and soul regardless of life or death.

556
00:38:03.78 --> 00:38:10.34
After exerting all your powers spiritually and physically, calmly face death rejoicing

557
00:38:10.34 --> 00:38:17.70
in the hope of living in the eternal cause for which you serve.

558
00:38:17.70 --> 00:38:23.06
You see little Kamakaze activity creeping in right there.

559
00:38:23.06 --> 00:38:24.06
Honor.

560
00:38:24.06 --> 00:38:25.06
Next section.

561
00:38:25.06 --> 00:38:28.34
Strong are those who have a keen sense of honor.

562
00:38:28.34 --> 00:38:34.26
Meet the expectations of your family and home community by making effort upon effort, always

563
00:38:34.26 --> 00:38:38.78
mindful of the honor of your name.

564
00:38:38.78 --> 00:38:44.54
If alive do not suffer the disgrace of becoming a prisoner.

565
00:38:44.54 --> 00:38:53.10
In death do not leave behind a name, soiled by misdeeds.

566
00:38:53.10 --> 00:38:54.10
No surrender.

567
00:38:54.10 --> 00:38:55.38
I was reading something.

568
00:38:55.38 --> 00:38:57.34
I forget the facts off the top of my head.

569
00:38:57.34 --> 00:39:05.14
But the number of the number of Japanese military that were taken prisoner was like this

570
00:39:05.14 --> 00:39:06.86
tiny number.

571
00:39:06.86 --> 00:39:11.62
It was like, I don't know, 30, 40, 50,000 something like that.

572
00:39:11.62 --> 00:39:17.26
I say it's a tiny number when you compare it to the amount of Germans.

573
00:39:17.26 --> 00:39:22.18
There was millions of Germans that were taken prisoner at one point or another.

574
00:39:22.18 --> 00:39:24.14
Again, don't quote beyond the number.

575
00:39:24.14 --> 00:39:26.10
But the disparity is huge.

576
00:39:26.10 --> 00:39:32.62
This is why they were not going to be taken prisoner.

577
00:39:32.62 --> 00:39:35.06
Next simplicity and fortitude.

578
00:39:35.06 --> 00:39:38.50
Hey, law of combat, keep things simple.

579
00:39:38.50 --> 00:39:40.10
Fortitude, yes, you got to have fortitude.

580
00:39:40.10 --> 00:39:41.10
Here we go.

581
00:39:41.10 --> 00:39:44.18
Let simplicity guide your daily life on the battlefield.

582
00:39:44.18 --> 00:39:49.54
Promote habits of fortitude and the high morale.

583
00:39:49.54 --> 00:39:51.26
Can't argue with that.

584
00:39:51.26 --> 00:39:52.90
Life on the field must be plain.

585
00:39:52.90 --> 00:39:57.66
Consider privation your daily lot and endeavor to be thrifty.

586
00:39:57.66 --> 00:39:58.66
Luxury Saps Valor.

587
00:39:58.66 --> 00:40:00.98
Oh, I like that.

588
00:40:00.98 --> 00:40:02.98
There you go.

589
00:40:02.98 --> 00:40:04.70
Luxury Saps Valor.

590
00:40:04.70 --> 00:40:08.58
The Ovalon, are you listening?

591
00:40:08.58 --> 00:40:09.58
Luxury.

592
00:40:09.58 --> 00:40:11.66
Can't have those luxury days too often.

593
00:40:11.66 --> 00:40:15.26
This is this idea of simplicity, of course, important.

594
00:40:15.26 --> 00:40:22.06
And even, you know, I talk about simplicity from a, you know, from a, from a communications

595
00:40:22.06 --> 00:40:24.78
viewpoint and from a planning viewpoint.

596
00:40:24.78 --> 00:40:28.94
But in life, simplicity is a very positive thing.

597
00:40:28.94 --> 00:40:32.78
You know, you got the modern day minimalist movement.

598
00:40:32.78 --> 00:40:33.94
Are you familiar with that?

599
00:40:33.94 --> 00:40:34.66
Yes.

600
00:40:34.66 --> 00:40:35.66
Or you don't own anything.

601
00:40:35.66 --> 00:40:38.18
Or as little as you can.

602
00:40:38.18 --> 00:40:39.18
Yeah.

603
00:40:39.18 --> 00:40:47.58
Though the cool, one of the coolest things about going on deployment in the dams,

604
00:40:47.58 --> 00:40:48.98
perking their dirty.

605
00:40:48.98 --> 00:40:54.42
One of the coolest things about it is you, everyone's a minimalist.

606
00:40:54.42 --> 00:40:56.38
It's just, you go on deployment.

607
00:40:56.38 --> 00:41:00.78
You have, like, whatever, five bags.

608
00:41:00.78 --> 00:41:06.86
In the bags, you have three, you know, three pairs of pants, two pairs of boots, four

609
00:41:06.86 --> 00:41:08.78
t-shirts.

610
00:41:08.78 --> 00:41:11.62
Got your weapon, got your body armor.

611
00:41:11.62 --> 00:41:14.38
You're, like, you're, it's so awesome.

612
00:41:14.38 --> 00:41:21.10
And it feels really good when you're able to get away from all that stuff that you got

613
00:41:21.10 --> 00:41:25.78
piling up back in your big house with the big closets.

614
00:41:25.78 --> 00:41:27.42
You got all that stuff in there.

615
00:41:27.42 --> 00:41:30.14
And all that stuff weighs down on you.

616
00:41:30.14 --> 00:41:34.86
And when you get to, you know, Tony, BTF, Tony, we're used to joke about you and you

617
00:41:34.86 --> 00:41:38.86
got like, you know, you got problems going on, you know, at home and everyone's just like

618
00:41:38.86 --> 00:41:44.26
bothering you and you just like, get on a, you just get on a C13 ball.

619
00:41:44.26 --> 00:41:48.46
Everything's fine.

620
00:41:48.46 --> 00:41:50.02
And I agree with that.

621
00:41:50.02 --> 00:41:52.30
You would get that feeling of everything's fine.

622
00:41:52.30 --> 00:41:53.66
Your guess, hey, there's nothing.

623
00:41:53.66 --> 00:41:55.90
We're all you have to worry about as the bad guys.

624
00:41:55.90 --> 00:41:56.90
Right?

625
00:41:56.90 --> 00:41:57.90
It's very easy.

626
00:41:57.90 --> 00:41:58.90
It's very focused.

627
00:41:58.90 --> 00:41:59.90
It's just stuff going on.

628
00:41:59.90 --> 00:42:02.58
And you don't have all this other literal stuff.

629
00:42:02.58 --> 00:42:04.66
You just got what you need.

630
00:42:04.66 --> 00:42:08.50
You don't bring, if you don't bring it, if you don't need it, you don't bring it.

631
00:42:08.50 --> 00:42:10.82
Because you don't want this other stuff.

632
00:42:10.82 --> 00:42:11.82
Right?

633
00:42:11.82 --> 00:42:13.62
So you, you keep it.

634
00:42:13.62 --> 00:42:14.62
Keep it simple.

635
00:42:14.62 --> 00:42:16.26
It's what you keep it.

636
00:42:16.26 --> 00:42:19.18
And that's what they're saying here.

637
00:42:19.18 --> 00:42:25.54
And, you know, of course, I doubt, I doubt that the Emperor was living, you know, a simple

638
00:42:25.54 --> 00:42:28.38
life of privation in the palace.

639
00:42:28.38 --> 00:42:29.38
Right?

640
00:42:29.38 --> 00:42:33.82
But if we can convince all the people, if we can convince everyone that they should just

641
00:42:33.82 --> 00:42:38.78
be living like in the dirt, cool, more from me.

642
00:42:38.78 --> 00:42:40.86
So there's a little bit of that going on.

643
00:42:40.86 --> 00:42:44.94
Trying to keep the people with the positive mindset, even though they don't have anything.

644
00:42:44.94 --> 00:42:47.78
Telling them that you don't want anything because it's going to sap your valor.

645
00:42:47.78 --> 00:42:49.74
You want to live it lean.

646
00:42:49.74 --> 00:42:50.74
Right?

647
00:42:50.74 --> 00:42:54.34
Luxury, sap's valor.

648
00:42:54.34 --> 00:42:59.10
Ooh, true statement though, true statement.

649
00:42:59.10 --> 00:43:01.14
What happens to rock and roll bands?

650
00:43:01.14 --> 00:43:03.90
They're a valor gets saped.

651
00:43:03.90 --> 00:43:04.90
No.

652
00:43:04.90 --> 00:43:07.30
They come out with a good album.

653
00:43:07.30 --> 00:43:08.30
Right?

654
00:43:08.30 --> 00:43:09.30
Good hard album.

655
00:43:09.30 --> 00:43:14.14
They ever go, yes, that's a kick ass album.

656
00:43:14.14 --> 00:43:17.46
And then the next thing, you know, they're living a life of luxury in their music gets

657
00:43:17.46 --> 00:43:18.86
soft and weak.

658
00:43:18.86 --> 00:43:19.86
Yeah.

659
00:43:19.86 --> 00:43:23.86
Maybe it's sap's their valor.

660
00:43:23.86 --> 00:43:25.70
They're grit.

661
00:43:25.70 --> 00:43:27.06
Next up, integrity.

662
00:43:27.06 --> 00:43:30.70
Integrity is the foundation of the spirit of the warrior.

663
00:43:30.70 --> 00:43:36.98
How can a man who cannot conquer his worldly desires devote his life to the country?

664
00:43:36.98 --> 00:43:44.02
Be austere in your daily behavior, deal with matters justly so that you will not be ashamed

665
00:43:44.02 --> 00:43:48.86
of your conduct in the sight of God or man.

666
00:43:48.86 --> 00:43:51.78
Hey, cool.

667
00:43:51.78 --> 00:43:52.78
Right?

668
00:43:52.78 --> 00:43:55.26
You know, keep control over your desires.

669
00:43:55.26 --> 00:43:56.26
God it.

670
00:43:56.26 --> 00:43:59.26
Let that sounds like a good idea.

671
00:43:59.26 --> 00:44:02.86
You know, act in such a way that you're that people, you know, this is going to go

672
00:44:02.86 --> 00:44:07.34
back to the, hey, imagine you're being at someone's video and you at all times.

673
00:44:07.34 --> 00:44:11.58
And then how do you really want to act the way if everyone was watching you all the

674
00:44:11.58 --> 00:44:12.58
time?

675
00:44:12.58 --> 00:44:13.58
How would you act?

676
00:44:13.58 --> 00:44:18.78
You want to make the right decisions that you can stand up before other man or God

677
00:44:18.78 --> 00:44:22.14
and be like, yep, my actions were fine.

678
00:44:22.14 --> 00:44:26.70
So that's what that's what this is saying.

679
00:44:26.70 --> 00:44:28.14
Can we argue against that?

680
00:44:28.14 --> 00:44:32.66
Not really what was interesting is you read some of those Kamakaze letters.

681
00:44:32.66 --> 00:44:40.14
A lot of them specifically say there was no, I have no, I have no woman in my life.

682
00:44:40.14 --> 00:44:42.90
They specifically say that.

683
00:44:42.90 --> 00:44:44.30
Like I've read a bunch of those letters.

684
00:44:44.30 --> 00:44:46.18
I don't know how many, but a lot.

685
00:44:46.18 --> 00:44:51.42
And there's a decent percentage, I don't know, maybe 10 percent, which is a lot when you think

686
00:44:51.42 --> 00:44:54.86
about it, but a lot of the letters and who knows on the actual percentage.

687
00:44:54.86 --> 00:45:00.90
But if you read some of those letters, you'll see these young 18, 19, 20 years old,

688
00:45:00.90 --> 00:45:05.30
bragging to their parents, I have no female in my life.

689
00:45:05.30 --> 00:45:07.02
Oh, they say that I'm positive.

690
00:45:07.02 --> 00:45:11.78
They say, they're positive possible way that I have no, they'll say, you know, I have

691
00:45:11.78 --> 00:45:14.42
no need for money or women.

692
00:45:14.42 --> 00:45:15.66
They say these things.

693
00:45:15.66 --> 00:45:21.02
So they're actually telling their parents like, I all I have is you, right?

694
00:45:21.02 --> 00:45:27.78
They're more looking to honor their parents than they are looking to have a girlfriend,

695
00:45:27.78 --> 00:45:32.78
which to me is is really jacked up.

696
00:45:32.78 --> 00:45:37.78
You know, when you're 18 years old, you have a girlfriend.

697
00:45:37.78 --> 00:45:38.78
Sure.

698
00:45:38.78 --> 00:45:39.78
Am I wrong?

699
00:45:39.78 --> 00:45:42.46
I, you know, I'm teach their own, I guess.

700
00:45:42.46 --> 00:45:45.10
Bra, come on, you're 18 years old.

701
00:45:45.10 --> 00:45:47.66
An 18 year old needs a girlfriend.

702
00:45:47.66 --> 00:45:51.86
Yeah, no, not if he's like committed to the cause.

703
00:45:51.86 --> 00:45:57.10
You know, I always felt that like, especially at 18, if you're committed to like, I don't

704
00:45:57.10 --> 00:46:00.62
know, if it, well, again, to each their own, for sure.

705
00:46:00.62 --> 00:46:07.94
But it is not uncommon for an 18 year old dedicated to a, what's the cause to cause?

706
00:46:07.94 --> 00:46:08.94
I don't know.

707
00:46:08.94 --> 00:46:09.94
Whatever.

708
00:46:09.94 --> 00:46:11.98
In whatever situation to get, to get.

709
00:46:11.98 --> 00:46:13.94
And because they got some.

710
00:46:13.94 --> 00:46:14.94
No, that's true.

711
00:46:14.94 --> 00:46:17.62
I'm not saying the girlfriends won't jam you up.

712
00:46:17.62 --> 00:46:18.62
Yeah, they will.

713
00:46:18.62 --> 00:46:22.38
So especially when you're 17, 16, 18, 14, 13.

714
00:46:22.38 --> 00:46:23.38
It's 20, 24.

715
00:46:23.38 --> 00:46:26.66
Yeah, it even's out at about 30.

716
00:46:26.66 --> 00:46:27.66
It's 30.

717
00:46:27.66 --> 00:46:28.66
Yeah, it's where you get a grip.

718
00:46:28.66 --> 00:46:29.66
Yeah, it's where you get a grip.

719
00:46:29.66 --> 00:46:32.62
Well, probably because of yourself to be honest with you, but 100%.

720
00:46:32.62 --> 00:46:34.66
Yeah, it's not the grip.

721
00:46:34.66 --> 00:46:35.66
Yeah, it's you.

722
00:46:35.66 --> 00:46:41.50
But yes, so they, you know, like, I don't know, 18, what do you do at 18?

723
00:46:41.50 --> 00:46:42.50
Military, I would imagine.

724
00:46:42.50 --> 00:46:43.50
I know it football.

725
00:46:43.50 --> 00:46:44.50
It was like that.

726
00:46:44.50 --> 00:46:45.50
The girlfriend.

727
00:46:45.50 --> 00:46:47.50
You know, it's like kidding in the middle.

728
00:46:47.50 --> 00:46:49.58
No girls whatsoever.

729
00:46:49.58 --> 00:46:50.98
Are you talking like, yeah, oh, yeah.

730
00:46:50.98 --> 00:46:52.58
Just an inch from girls.

731
00:46:52.58 --> 00:46:55.14
I'm not saying actual accidents is the next level.

732
00:46:55.14 --> 00:46:56.14
Echoed.

733
00:46:56.14 --> 00:47:02.34
No, but I am saying if you're trying to demonstrate or illustrate the your loyalty

734
00:47:02.34 --> 00:47:05.26
to parents, the cause, whatever.

735
00:47:05.26 --> 00:47:06.70
Yes, you say like, proud.

736
00:47:06.70 --> 00:47:12.82
I don't even girls don't even like, you know, waiver my dedication to the cause.

737
00:47:12.82 --> 00:47:13.82
You know, okay.

738
00:47:13.82 --> 00:47:14.82
I get that.

739
00:47:14.82 --> 00:47:15.82
I get that.

740
00:47:15.82 --> 00:47:16.82
That's what this is saying.

741
00:47:16.82 --> 00:47:28.94
I don't think I necessarily agree with the 1918, 20 year old male human having no female interaction.

742
00:47:28.94 --> 00:47:29.94
Yeah.

743
00:47:29.94 --> 00:47:34.54
To me, that just sounds like not the best idea.

744
00:47:34.54 --> 00:47:36.90
Well, let's put it this way.

745
00:47:36.90 --> 00:47:39.86
I agree with you.

746
00:47:39.86 --> 00:47:44.90
But I agree with this because I feel like that's just what they're saying.

747
00:47:44.90 --> 00:47:46.42
No, it's definitely no.

748
00:47:46.42 --> 00:47:47.42
I agree with you.

749
00:47:47.42 --> 00:47:48.42
I agree with you.

750
00:47:48.42 --> 00:47:49.42
Yeah, I agree with you.

751
00:47:49.42 --> 00:47:54.90
It's, and I think what hit me weird was the, the Kamakaze violence that are just

752
00:47:54.90 --> 00:47:57.06
like so happy that they don't have a girlfriend.

753
00:47:57.06 --> 00:48:00.06
I'm thinking, are you really that happy that you don't have a girlfriend?

754
00:48:00.06 --> 00:48:04.42
And if you are that happy that you don't have a girlfriend, they kept you in lockdown.

755
00:48:04.42 --> 00:48:05.42
Right?

756
00:48:05.42 --> 00:48:07.34
They kept you in a serious lockdown.

757
00:48:07.34 --> 00:48:08.34
Yes.

758
00:48:08.34 --> 00:48:15.22
Because do you remember, I mean, when you're a boy, when you're 10 years old, when you're 11

759
00:48:15.22 --> 00:48:19.18
years old, 12 years old, like you're already looking at girls like, oh, I want to hang

760
00:48:19.18 --> 00:48:21.82
out with that thing right over there.

761
00:48:21.82 --> 00:48:24.62
That girl, I want to go like talk to that, right?

762
00:48:24.62 --> 00:48:25.62
Talk to that thing.

763
00:48:25.62 --> 00:48:26.62
Yeah.

764
00:48:26.62 --> 00:48:27.62
You know what I'm saying?

765
00:48:27.62 --> 00:48:28.62
Like it's an instinct.

766
00:48:28.62 --> 00:48:29.62
Yes.

767
00:48:29.62 --> 00:48:33.74
That is fully there as a, as a dude.

768
00:48:33.74 --> 00:48:34.74
Right.

769
00:48:34.74 --> 00:48:39.90
But at that most cases, at that point, I would argue that in most cases, you're not consciously

770
00:48:39.90 --> 00:48:44.70
thinking of a meaningful productive relationship necessarily.

771
00:48:44.70 --> 00:48:49.58
You just have a sort of a feeling in a sort of like attraction or draw towards this thing.

772
00:48:49.58 --> 00:48:53.26
And that attraction and draw towards this thing.

773
00:48:53.26 --> 00:48:54.26
Yeah.

774
00:48:54.26 --> 00:48:56.94
We'll get in the way or at the very least come here.

775
00:48:56.94 --> 00:48:57.94
You're right.

776
00:48:57.94 --> 00:48:58.94
I get you.

777
00:48:58.94 --> 00:48:59.94
I'm saying, I hear you.

778
00:48:59.94 --> 00:49:00.94
Yes, you gotta be.

779
00:49:00.94 --> 00:49:05.30
And definitely, if you're 17 years old, you gotta be careful that girls don't pull

780
00:49:05.30 --> 00:49:06.78
you off track.

781
00:49:06.78 --> 00:49:08.06
Yeah.

782
00:49:08.06 --> 00:49:09.90
And by the way, I'm saying this in one direction.

783
00:49:09.90 --> 00:49:11.26
Same thing opposite direction.

784
00:49:11.26 --> 00:49:12.74
I guess I should've said that.

785
00:49:12.74 --> 00:49:13.74
But wouldn't you know?

786
00:49:13.74 --> 00:49:17.18
Girls will get pulled off track by boys.

787
00:49:17.18 --> 00:49:18.18
Oh, yes.

788
00:49:18.18 --> 00:49:22.70
So I guess what we're talking about is getting the relationship going.

789
00:49:22.70 --> 00:49:23.70
Yeah.

790
00:49:23.70 --> 00:49:24.70
Okay.

791
00:49:24.70 --> 00:49:26.62
I agree with you.

792
00:49:26.62 --> 00:49:31.26
If you are fully committed to the cause, one thing that could fall away from your commitment

793
00:49:31.26 --> 00:49:33.82
would be, look, I'm not even, I don't care about girls.

794
00:49:33.82 --> 00:49:34.82
That's where I'm at.

795
00:49:34.82 --> 00:49:35.82
Okay.

796
00:49:35.82 --> 00:49:36.82
I get you.

797
00:49:36.82 --> 00:49:37.82
I'll give it to you.

798
00:49:37.82 --> 00:49:39.42
Actually, you kind of have to because you were like that.

799
00:49:39.42 --> 00:49:43.62
Even when you said when you were overseas, you didn't like, you know, you didn't want

800
00:49:43.62 --> 00:49:46.10
to think about your family, you don't want to do it.

801
00:49:46.10 --> 00:49:51.46
So what would have even made it better technically in this specific way is to not even

802
00:49:51.46 --> 00:49:54.66
have a family, not even have a girlfriend, not even have a wife to admit.

803
00:49:54.66 --> 00:49:55.66
Exactly.

804
00:49:55.66 --> 00:49:56.66
Right.

805
00:49:56.66 --> 00:49:57.66
So yeah.

806
00:49:57.66 --> 00:49:58.66
So that's what they're going to say, you know?

807
00:49:58.66 --> 00:49:59.66
Yeah.

808
00:49:59.66 --> 00:50:00.66
No, that's the ultimate commitment.

809
00:50:00.66 --> 00:50:02.70
You are correct.

810
00:50:02.70 --> 00:50:05.26
I don't agree with it, though.

811
00:50:05.26 --> 00:50:08.14
Well, ironically, I don't agree with it.

812
00:50:08.14 --> 00:50:09.14
Yeah.

813
00:50:09.14 --> 00:50:11.14
You're just, well, you see their point.

814
00:50:11.14 --> 00:50:12.14
Yes, sir.

815
00:50:12.14 --> 00:50:14.58
And that's why I kind of lived that way when I was overseas.

816
00:50:14.58 --> 00:50:16.98
Hey, I don't want to look at pictures of my wife and kids while I'm here.

817
00:50:16.98 --> 00:50:19.06
I want to focus on the mission at hand.

818
00:50:19.06 --> 00:50:23.54
But that's a lot different than coming home and saying, oh, I don't want to have any

819
00:50:23.54 --> 00:50:24.86
female in my life.

820
00:50:24.86 --> 00:50:25.86
Yeah.

821
00:50:25.86 --> 00:50:26.86
It's a lot different.

822
00:50:26.86 --> 00:50:27.86
Yeah.

823
00:50:27.86 --> 00:50:30.58
Or if you're a female, saying, look, I don't want to be focused on.

824
00:50:30.58 --> 00:50:33.90
I guess I guess that happens, you know, on the other way, too.

825
00:50:33.90 --> 00:50:34.90
Yeah, fully.

826
00:50:34.90 --> 00:50:37.22
You know, a female that's committed to her career.

827
00:50:37.22 --> 00:50:38.54
So she doesn't want to have kids.

828
00:50:38.54 --> 00:50:41.74
She doesn't want to get married because she's focused on the career.

829
00:50:41.74 --> 00:50:42.74
Yeah.

830
00:50:42.74 --> 00:50:43.74
Yeah.

831
00:50:43.74 --> 00:50:48.06
Which is actually cool, but it is an extreme way to get down.

832
00:50:48.06 --> 00:50:49.06
All right.

833
00:50:49.06 --> 00:50:54.90
Well, I don't believe there's any conduct that you need to be ashamed of if you have

834
00:50:54.90 --> 00:50:55.90
a girlfriend.

835
00:50:55.90 --> 00:50:56.90
It's what I'm saying.

836
00:50:56.90 --> 00:50:58.90
There you go.

837
00:50:58.90 --> 00:51:01.18
All right.

838
00:51:01.18 --> 00:51:06.26
Chapter three, Council Concerning Field Service.

839
00:51:06.26 --> 00:51:12.94
Moments negligence may result in an unexpected catastrophe, be constantly on your guard,

840
00:51:12.94 --> 00:51:16.78
do not despise your enemy or the natives.

841
00:51:16.78 --> 00:51:19.14
Do not be negligent after a small success.

842
00:51:19.14 --> 00:51:20.14
Okay.

843
00:51:20.14 --> 00:51:21.14
Let's just go through this.

844
00:51:21.14 --> 00:51:22.14
Okay.

845
00:51:22.14 --> 00:51:25.98
So a moment's negligence may result in an unexpected catastrophe.

846
00:51:25.98 --> 00:51:27.38
That's a great point.

847
00:51:27.38 --> 00:51:29.18
Pay attention.

848
00:51:29.18 --> 00:51:30.82
Be constantly on your guard.

849
00:51:30.82 --> 00:51:31.82
Great point.

850
00:51:31.82 --> 00:51:33.54
Pay attention.

851
00:51:33.54 --> 00:51:37.46
Do not despise your enemy or the natives.

852
00:51:37.46 --> 00:51:38.46
Great point.

853
00:51:38.46 --> 00:51:39.46
Right.

854
00:51:39.46 --> 00:51:44.50
We're going to go fight with honor and we're not going to abuse the natives.

855
00:51:44.50 --> 00:51:47.66
Do not be negligent after a small success.

856
00:51:47.66 --> 00:51:48.90
Great point.

857
00:51:48.90 --> 00:51:53.46
That's when you're going to get arrogant and your ego gets out of control and you get caught.

858
00:51:53.46 --> 00:51:58.46
Know that carelessness brings disaster.

859
00:51:58.46 --> 00:52:01.22
Great point.

860
00:52:01.22 --> 00:52:02.22
So there you go.

861
00:52:02.22 --> 00:52:03.22
That's just opening up.

862
00:52:03.22 --> 00:52:05.74
That's how we roll.

863
00:52:05.74 --> 00:52:10.98
I wonder if this document was written like as a reaction to NAN King.

864
00:52:10.98 --> 00:52:13.14
I wonder if they said, look, we let that happen.

865
00:52:13.14 --> 00:52:14.14
We got to tighten up.

866
00:52:14.14 --> 00:52:15.30
I wonder if they actually did that.

867
00:52:15.30 --> 00:52:17.30
The US military does that kind of thing.

868
00:52:17.30 --> 00:52:20.62
Something will go, hey, the prisoner abuse happened in Obegrabe.

869
00:52:20.62 --> 00:52:23.66
They made all kinds of rules and regulations about what you do with prisoners after that.

870
00:52:23.66 --> 00:52:25.54
I wonder if this is the same kind of thing.

871
00:52:25.54 --> 00:52:29.34
They tried to tighten them up.

872
00:52:29.34 --> 00:52:34.14
The entry duty is important upon the century rest the safety of an army.

873
00:52:34.14 --> 00:52:37.22
He also represents the discipline of an army.

874
00:52:37.22 --> 00:52:41.54
Those on sentry duty must devote their entire person to the task which must be sternly

875
00:52:41.54 --> 00:52:43.34
carried out.

876
00:52:43.34 --> 00:52:45.90
A cordva century high respect.

877
00:52:45.90 --> 00:52:46.90
Cool.

878
00:52:46.90 --> 00:52:49.10
Got to be on guard.

879
00:52:49.10 --> 00:52:55.06
Next ideological warfare is an important phase in modern conflict.

880
00:52:55.06 --> 00:52:59.18
Destroy propaganda and fabrications of the enemy.

881
00:52:59.18 --> 00:53:06.10
Why you're unshakable faith in the cause for which the Empire stands and endeavor to spread

882
00:53:06.10 --> 00:53:07.74
Kodo.

883
00:53:07.74 --> 00:53:09.94
Which again, that's the spirit of the Empire.

884
00:53:09.94 --> 00:53:15.26
So they're telling you to watch out for the enemy propaganda and how you overcome it

885
00:53:15.26 --> 00:53:20.14
is by having unshakable faith.

886
00:53:20.14 --> 00:53:23.66
Next up, rumors arise from a lack of confidence.

887
00:53:23.66 --> 00:53:25.30
Do not be misled.

888
00:53:25.30 --> 00:53:27.30
Do not be agitated by them.

889
00:53:27.30 --> 00:53:34.70
Normally believe in the strength of the imperial army and deeply trust your superiors.

890
00:53:34.70 --> 00:53:35.70
Deeply trust your superiors.

891
00:53:35.70 --> 00:53:38.18
There's no b-wise on the end of that.

892
00:53:38.18 --> 00:53:42.74
Like the American manual said, trust your superiors but b-wise.

893
00:53:42.74 --> 00:53:47.10
Also rumors arise from a lack of confidence.

894
00:53:47.10 --> 00:53:48.34
I disagree with that.

895
00:53:48.34 --> 00:53:54.18
I think rumors arise from lack of knowledge and lack of hearing the truth.

896
00:53:54.18 --> 00:53:59.18
That's the way you overcome rumors.

897
00:53:59.18 --> 00:54:01.18
That's how you stop rumors.

898
00:54:01.18 --> 00:54:05.46
Number 6, be mindful to protect the enemy property and resources.

899
00:54:05.46 --> 00:54:09.70
Requisitions, seizures and destruction of goods and similar actions must be executed and

900
00:54:09.70 --> 00:54:14.58
keeping with the regulations and always under the orders of your commanding officer.

901
00:54:14.58 --> 00:54:15.58
This is incredible.

902
00:54:15.58 --> 00:54:20.30
They're literally saying, hey, you know, when you defeat someone, you've got enemy property.

903
00:54:20.30 --> 00:54:22.70
You need to treat it well.

904
00:54:22.70 --> 00:54:23.70
You can't see it.

905
00:54:23.70 --> 00:54:24.70
You can't destroy it.

906
00:54:24.70 --> 00:54:25.70
There you go.

907
00:54:25.70 --> 00:54:27.70
This is like guidance.

908
00:54:27.70 --> 00:54:36.58
7, be gentle and protect innocent inhabitants in the spirit of benevolence and accordance

909
00:54:36.58 --> 00:54:41.74
with the true ideal of the imperial army.

910
00:54:41.74 --> 00:54:46.98
Like I said, maybe this is a reaction to what happened to Nan King because there was no

911
00:54:46.98 --> 00:54:53.98
being gentle and no protecting the innocent there.

912
00:54:53.98 --> 00:54:54.98
Those are on the field.

913
00:54:54.98 --> 00:55:01.30
Must not indulge in wine and women or allow desire to be clouded their consciences.

914
00:55:01.30 --> 00:55:07.22
They're by damaging the prestige of the imperial army and causing the dissipation of a body

915
00:55:07.22 --> 00:55:09.38
dedicated to service.

916
00:55:09.38 --> 00:55:12.74
So that one is written for echo trials.

917
00:55:12.74 --> 00:55:13.74
No wine, no women.

918
00:55:13.74 --> 00:55:16.10
Those are just going to just going to jam you up.

919
00:55:16.10 --> 00:55:19.62
They will concur.

920
00:55:19.62 --> 00:55:24.46
Okay.

921
00:55:24.46 --> 00:55:32.90
They should exercise self-control less than they per smurch the pure character of warriors.

922
00:55:32.90 --> 00:55:33.90
9.

923
00:55:33.90 --> 00:55:37.26
Control your anger, good to go, and suppress your grudges.

924
00:55:37.26 --> 00:55:39.98
The ancient said consider anger your enemy.

925
00:55:39.98 --> 00:55:44.26
A moment of violence often leaves cause for a long regret.

926
00:55:44.26 --> 00:55:47.02
It's great advice.

927
00:55:47.02 --> 00:55:49.38
Control your anger, control your emotions.

928
00:55:49.38 --> 00:55:53.38
The severity of military laws designed especially to uphold the good name of soldiers and

929
00:55:53.38 --> 00:55:55.78
the preserve the dignity of the imperial army.

930
00:55:55.78 --> 00:56:00.10
Always remember the oath that you made and the deep emotion that you felt when you left

931
00:56:00.10 --> 00:56:01.82
home.

932
00:56:01.82 --> 00:56:07.38
Call to mind how your parents, your wife and your children think of you and avoid exposing

933
00:56:07.38 --> 00:56:10.90
yourself to crime.

934
00:56:10.90 --> 00:56:19.22
Your guidance to achievements of soldiers in service foster the tradition of respecting

935
00:56:19.22 --> 00:56:24.86
martial attainments, cultivate and train the warriors of virtues and arts.

936
00:56:24.86 --> 00:56:34.62
Remember that do not allow yourself to become bored is the saying of an ancient general.

937
00:56:34.62 --> 00:56:38.54
So hey, look, we're telling people to train.

938
00:56:38.54 --> 00:56:41.50
When warrior arts train the virtues of the warriors.

939
00:56:41.50 --> 00:56:45.38
This is all good stuff.

940
00:56:45.38 --> 00:56:49.06
And remember that to don't allow yourself to become bored.

941
00:56:49.06 --> 00:56:50.62
When's the last time you were bored?

942
00:56:50.62 --> 00:56:53.10
I'm not really long time.

943
00:56:53.10 --> 00:56:57.42
Yeah, I'm not really one getting bored over here on my side either.

944
00:56:57.42 --> 00:57:01.50
Next do not allow yourself to worry about the fate of those at home in the event of your

945
00:57:01.50 --> 00:57:05.30
death but devote yourself wholly to service.

946
00:57:05.30 --> 00:57:10.06
Be always ready to meet death without regret by settling your affairs beforehand.

947
00:57:10.06 --> 00:57:15.78
A soldier is always prepared to expose his corpse on the battlefield.

948
00:57:15.78 --> 00:57:22.18
Let his family know that at times even his ashes may not reach them.

949
00:57:22.18 --> 00:57:28.42
So there's again there's some Kamikaze attitude sneaking in there that you may have to

950
00:57:28.42 --> 00:57:30.06
lay it all down.

951
00:57:30.06 --> 00:57:37.50
Next there is nothing more to be regretted than to fall victim to a disease on the field.

952
00:57:37.50 --> 00:57:44.54
Be particularly mindful of your health so that you may not be unable to serve because of

953
00:57:44.54 --> 00:57:45.54
excesses.

954
00:57:45.54 --> 00:57:47.82
So you gotta keep track of your health.

955
00:57:47.82 --> 00:57:51.46
Don't get sick.

956
00:57:51.46 --> 00:57:54.42
Late to heart the saying of an ancient warrior.

957
00:57:54.42 --> 00:57:57.94
My sword is my soul, my horse is my fortune.

958
00:57:57.94 --> 00:58:02.50
Always take care of your arms and supplies and give humane attention to animals on the

959
00:58:02.50 --> 00:58:04.50
field.

960
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:07.38
Solid.

961
00:58:07.38 --> 00:58:09.54
Take care of your gear and your gear to take care of you.

962
00:58:09.54 --> 00:58:11.54
Have you heard that before?

963
00:58:11.54 --> 00:58:12.54
Yes, for me.

964
00:58:12.54 --> 00:58:13.54
Okay.

965
00:58:13.54 --> 00:58:14.54
That's a good one.

966
00:58:14.54 --> 00:58:15.54
Yes, seems good.

967
00:58:15.54 --> 00:58:17.02
It's a true one.

968
00:58:17.02 --> 00:58:18.02
Seems true.

969
00:58:18.02 --> 00:58:19.02
Yeah.

970
00:58:19.02 --> 00:58:24.78
Virtue in the battle zone is the source of strength in combat.

971
00:58:24.78 --> 00:58:31.10
Please consider the interests of other units and do not monopolize billets and materials.

972
00:58:31.10 --> 00:58:35.66
Remember the saying a bird taking flight does not muddy the water.

973
00:58:35.66 --> 00:58:43.14
Let the good reputation of the valorous impure army long remain the cause of fond recollections

974
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:44.70
in an alien land.

975
00:58:44.70 --> 00:58:46.42
So there you go.

976
00:58:46.42 --> 00:58:54.14
They're telling everyone to have be virtuous in the combat zone.

977
00:58:54.14 --> 00:58:57.14
Bird in flight does not muddy the water.

978
00:58:57.14 --> 00:59:00.98
I think it just means as you elevate.

979
00:59:00.98 --> 00:59:04.26
Then you're not, you know, you don't need to get mad because it's not mudding the water.

980
00:59:04.26 --> 00:59:05.26
It's good.

981
00:59:05.26 --> 00:59:06.26
You're moving forward.

982
00:59:06.26 --> 00:59:07.26
Yeah.

983
00:59:07.26 --> 00:59:08.26
Could be wrong.

984
00:59:08.26 --> 00:59:10.26
Very obscure.

985
00:59:10.26 --> 00:59:13.94
A bird taking flight does not muddy the water.

986
00:59:13.94 --> 00:59:21.78
Let the good reputation of the valorous impure army long remain the cause of fond recollections

987
00:59:21.78 --> 00:59:22.78
in an alien in the land.

988
00:59:22.78 --> 00:59:23.78
Yeah.

989
00:59:23.78 --> 00:59:25.78
I mean, like, hey, this is where elevated.

990
00:59:25.78 --> 00:59:27.38
We're, hey, we're in this land.

991
00:59:27.38 --> 00:59:28.38
We're here.

992
00:59:28.38 --> 00:59:29.38
We invaded.

993
00:59:29.38 --> 00:59:30.86
But we're not going to muddy the water.

994
00:59:30.86 --> 00:59:35.38
We're, we're in flight.

995
00:59:35.38 --> 00:59:41.22
Next, you're not boast of one of one's achievements, but give others credit.

996
00:59:41.22 --> 00:59:46.10
But to give others credit is one of the most respected traditions among warriors.

997
00:59:46.10 --> 00:59:50.66
This is straight out of extreme ownership, straight out of the dichotomy of leadership.

998
00:59:50.66 --> 00:59:54.10
No, you don't, you don't boast of achievements.

999
00:59:54.10 --> 00:59:55.70
You give your credit to your team.

1000
00:59:55.70 --> 01:00:00.86
Do not begrudge others their promotion or cherish resentment because your services are

1001
01:00:00.86 --> 01:00:01.86
not recognized.

1002
01:00:01.86 --> 01:00:03.98
But instead reflect upon your own shortcomings.

1003
01:00:03.98 --> 01:00:06.66
This is, this is solid.

1004
01:00:06.66 --> 01:00:08.66
That's solid advice, right?

1005
01:00:08.66 --> 01:00:09.66
Oh, you got promoted.

1006
01:00:09.66 --> 01:00:10.66
I didn't.

1007
01:00:10.66 --> 01:00:12.66
I'm just going to hit mad at you.

1008
01:00:12.66 --> 01:00:13.66
No.

1009
01:00:13.66 --> 01:00:16.50
And said, I should look at myself and say, okay, what did that go do that I didn't do?

1010
01:00:16.50 --> 01:00:17.50
What could I do better?

1011
01:00:17.50 --> 01:00:18.50
What are my shortcomings?

1012
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:19.50
Yeah.

1013
01:00:19.50 --> 01:00:27.10
Next, be honest, always consider exaggerations and lies dishonorable.

1014
01:00:27.10 --> 01:00:28.10
Cool.

1015
01:00:28.10 --> 01:00:30.74
Where we're 100% on board with that.

1016
01:00:30.74 --> 01:00:34.54
Always bear yourself as a member of a great nation, trading the path of righteousness

1017
01:00:34.54 --> 01:00:40.06
and seeking justice so that you may enhance the prestige of the empire.

1018
01:00:40.06 --> 01:00:42.06
Totally positive.

1019
01:00:42.06 --> 01:00:47.90
They, the seal teams for a little while, they were trying to, it was something along

1020
01:00:47.90 --> 01:00:54.50
the lines of, I will not dishonor my team, my unit, my navy or my nation.

1021
01:00:54.50 --> 01:00:57.58
This is the same exact thing they've got written right there.

1022
01:00:57.58 --> 01:01:01.90
You know, you want to, you want to make the empire look good.

1023
01:01:01.90 --> 01:01:09.22
You want to damage the reputation.

1024
01:01:09.22 --> 01:01:12.54
Next.

1025
01:01:12.54 --> 01:01:20.02
So do not show a lack of consideration for international currencies.

1026
01:01:20.02 --> 01:01:21.02
Think about that.

1027
01:01:21.02 --> 01:01:22.02
Yeah.

1028
01:01:22.02 --> 01:01:25.98
Hey, when you go to another country, hey, don't, don't, you know, take in consideration

1029
01:01:25.98 --> 01:01:27.98
there, their customs and currencies.

1030
01:01:27.98 --> 01:01:32.70
That's a good thing to do.

1031
01:01:32.70 --> 01:01:36.78
And the last one from this section, should you receive the order to return home alive after

1032
01:01:36.78 --> 01:01:43.50
braving 10,000 deaths, think of those brave souls who will not return, be determined to

1033
01:01:43.50 --> 01:01:50.26
become an example to the people by being careful in word and deed, renewing your vows

1034
01:01:50.26 --> 01:01:52.22
to serve the country.

1035
01:01:52.22 --> 01:01:57.74
It's nothing wrong with that.

1036
01:01:57.74 --> 01:02:01.90
And then this is how this thing ends.

1037
01:02:01.90 --> 01:02:03.62
The conclusion.

1038
01:02:03.62 --> 01:02:13.06
The conclusion is above all the above originate from an end in the imperial rescript.

1039
01:02:13.06 --> 01:02:19.62
Let them serve as a guide in putting into practice this battlefield morality so that all

1040
01:02:19.62 --> 01:02:23.46
may be perfect in obeying the imperial commands.

1041
01:02:23.46 --> 01:02:30.98
Soldiers and officers on the field lay heart, lay to heart the import of the above by

1042
01:02:30.98 --> 01:02:37.22
fully realizing the significance of real service to the state in order that you may carry

1043
01:02:37.22 --> 01:02:50.54
out your duty as soldiers thus responding to the boundless imperial benevolence.

1044
01:02:50.54 --> 01:02:58.54
So like I said, there's parts of that document that you can't really argue with.

1045
01:02:58.54 --> 01:03:00.98
And it's a powerful document, it's a powerful code.

1046
01:03:00.98 --> 01:03:12.66
And that document obviously helped guide the actions of the military in Japan and of the

1047
01:03:12.66 --> 01:03:26.06
nation of Japan who were highly committed to this cause.

1048
01:03:26.06 --> 01:03:31.94
But one more letter from a Kamakaze.

1049
01:03:31.94 --> 01:03:35.62
Dear mother and father, now it has been decided that I will participate in a sortie

1050
01:03:35.62 --> 01:03:40.62
as a member of the Kamakaze Special Attack Corps Squadron.

1051
01:03:40.62 --> 01:03:45.46
I am deeply satisfied that nothing will surpass this as the long cherished desire of a

1052
01:03:45.46 --> 01:03:51.94
military man to die and attacking an enemy ship together with his aircraft.

1053
01:03:51.94 --> 01:03:57.42
When I think of my 23 years of life, I have not been able to repay anything for your

1054
01:03:57.42 --> 01:03:58.42
kindness.

1055
01:03:58.42 --> 01:04:01.94
However with a smile, please forgive me from the beginning.

1056
01:04:01.94 --> 01:04:05.50
I offered myself for the country.

1057
01:04:05.50 --> 01:04:10.74
The war is plunging into an increasingly critical period.

1058
01:04:10.74 --> 01:04:15.62
But I believe in victory for the Empire.

1059
01:04:15.62 --> 01:04:17.94
I believe others will follow after me.

1060
01:04:17.94 --> 01:04:22.62
I will make a body crashing attack against an enemy ship.

1061
01:04:22.62 --> 01:04:29.22
I am resolved that I will repay a ten thousandth of the Emperor's kindness.

1062
01:04:29.22 --> 01:04:35.94
I have not been as thankful as today to be born a Japanese person.

1063
01:04:35.94 --> 01:04:41.06
I, thy humble subject, live not in vain.

1064
01:04:41.06 --> 01:04:46.50
Having seen both heaven and earth prosper in this glorious age of vine.

1065
01:04:46.50 --> 01:04:51.58
This is an old poem and it is my state of mind.

1066
01:04:51.58 --> 01:04:57.98
Please give regards to my teachers at elementary school, junior high school and teachers

1067
01:04:57.98 --> 01:05:02.26
in college, all of the relatives and the villagers.

1068
01:05:02.26 --> 01:05:07.70
Finally I am praying for the welfare of everyone in the family, bravely I will fall

1069
01:05:07.70 --> 01:05:11.54
knowing the way of samurai.

1070
01:05:11.54 --> 01:05:16.46
For the Emperor who gave blessings.

1071
01:05:16.46 --> 01:05:23.74
So, Ensign Shijio Kaira.

1072
01:05:23.74 --> 01:05:37.02
And at twelve forty five on April 6, 1945, Ensign Kaira took off from Kusheira Air Base

1073
01:05:37.02 --> 01:05:49.38
and carried out his suicide attack off the coast of Okanawa.

1074
01:05:49.38 --> 01:06:00.02
And when you hear this code, when you hear these letters, you have to think yourself,

1075
01:06:00.02 --> 01:06:11.46
who could defeat an enemy that is that determined what warrior culture could have the values

1076
01:06:11.46 --> 01:06:20.94
and the courage to contend with and to actually defeat a people possessed with such willingness

1077
01:06:20.94 --> 01:06:26.14
to make sacrifices.

1078
01:06:26.14 --> 01:06:31.82
Such willingness to die for their cause, that is what you have to ask yourself.

1079
01:06:31.82 --> 01:06:41.74
That is what I ask myself is what people could oppose and fight against this warrior

1080
01:06:41.74 --> 01:06:46.14
breed.

1081
01:06:46.14 --> 01:06:52.50
And the answer to that question and this isn't a theoretical answer, but it is a factual

1082
01:06:52.50 --> 01:06:54.14
answer.

1083
01:06:54.14 --> 01:07:07.18
So warrior culture that faced and defeated this fanatics society was the United States of America.

1084
01:07:07.18 --> 01:07:14.82
And it was our own hardened breed of warriors from the army, navy, air force and marines

1085
01:07:14.82 --> 01:07:20.54
the American warrior culture.

1086
01:07:20.54 --> 01:07:28.22
The American warrior culture is what went from island to island and beach head to beach head

1087
01:07:28.22 --> 01:07:37.02
and pill box to pill box fighting and sacrificing.

1088
01:07:37.02 --> 01:07:48.70
Not only with a willingness to die, which they certainly had, but with a stronger willingness

1089
01:07:48.70 --> 01:08:00.58
to live, to live and not to live a life of subservience and obedience, but a life of

1090
01:08:00.58 --> 01:08:12.42
something much more powerful than all of that, a life of freedom.

1091
01:08:12.42 --> 01:08:23.42
And that culture, that American culture of individual freedom has proven out to be the most

1092
01:08:23.42 --> 01:08:30.74
powerful force in the world.

1093
01:08:30.74 --> 01:08:36.78
And for us to be able to protect that freedom, what we do is we voluntarily impose discipline

1094
01:08:36.78 --> 01:08:40.82
on ourselves.

1095
01:08:40.82 --> 01:08:42.98
We have the things that this book talked about.

1096
01:08:42.98 --> 01:08:45.38
We have conviction to win.

1097
01:08:45.38 --> 01:08:47.50
We believe in loyalty and responsibility.

1098
01:08:47.50 --> 01:08:52.66
We live with honor and valor and we work together to protect each other.

1099
01:08:52.66 --> 01:09:00.50
But we don't do that because we're mandated to do that.

1100
01:09:00.50 --> 01:09:07.02
We do it so we can defend our way of life.

1101
01:09:07.02 --> 01:09:18.62
We make sacrifices to preserve our culture because our way of life offers something.

1102
01:09:18.62 --> 01:09:28.70
Something that is the apex of human existence.

1103
01:09:28.70 --> 01:09:33.98
Freedom.

1104
01:09:33.98 --> 01:09:40.86
Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

1105
01:09:40.86 --> 01:09:45.02
Then that's why we fight.

1106
01:09:45.02 --> 01:09:47.66
And that's why we win.

1107
01:09:47.66 --> 01:09:48.82
We don't fight for glory.

1108
01:09:48.82 --> 01:09:50.46
We don't fight for personal gain.

1109
01:09:50.46 --> 01:09:53.94
We don't fight to impose our will onto others.

1110
01:09:53.94 --> 01:10:01.34
But we fight for freedom.

1111
01:10:01.34 --> 01:10:05.78
Freedom itself, that is our ideal.

1112
01:10:05.78 --> 01:10:11.22
That is our standard.

1113
01:10:11.22 --> 01:10:21.46
And we will never, ever surrender that ideal.

1114
01:10:21.46 --> 01:10:31.02
The ideal of freedom is our code.

1115
01:10:31.02 --> 01:10:43.54
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1116
01:10:43.54 --> 01:10:44.54
Echo Charles.

1117
01:10:44.54 --> 01:10:47.10
Yeah, it's good.

1118
01:10:47.10 --> 01:10:52.74
We are trying to maintain our freedom in order to do that.

1119
01:10:52.74 --> 01:10:58.66
We all know that we have to impose some discipline on ourselves.

1120
01:10:58.66 --> 01:11:05.66
That means putting in the work means trying to get better.

1121
01:11:05.66 --> 01:11:06.66
Sure.

1122
01:11:06.66 --> 01:11:13.66
You got some things that might help us as we had down that path.

1123
01:11:13.66 --> 01:11:14.66
Yeah, very much so.

1124
01:11:14.66 --> 01:11:25.14
But the imperial, the emperor seems like that's the part that kind of jammed everything

1125
01:11:25.14 --> 01:11:26.14
up.

1126
01:11:26.14 --> 01:11:30.02
The whole code, like the whole, what is this man?

1127
01:11:30.02 --> 01:11:33.62
You will call imperial rescript for soldiers and sailors.

1128
01:11:33.62 --> 01:11:35.90
Yeah, it's like man, this is all good.

1129
01:11:35.90 --> 01:11:38.38
It's all good except that one spot.

1130
01:11:38.38 --> 01:11:41.02
There were like, yeah, the emperor is like a lion.

1131
01:11:41.02 --> 01:11:42.90
Kind of as if to say okay.

1132
01:11:42.90 --> 01:11:47.38
But at the end of the day, like you got to listen to this like one.

1133
01:11:47.38 --> 01:11:53.18
Whereas at the end of the day, what we do is individual freedom.

1134
01:11:53.18 --> 01:11:54.18
Yeah.

1135
01:11:54.18 --> 01:11:55.18
What else?

1136
01:11:55.18 --> 01:11:56.18
Yeah.

1137
01:11:56.18 --> 01:11:59.78
Like we were collectively protecting this freedom that we have.

1138
01:11:59.78 --> 01:12:01.82
And we do that together.

1139
01:12:01.82 --> 01:12:04.78
But once we have that freedom, it's not about for someone else.

1140
01:12:04.78 --> 01:12:06.78
It's for the individual.

1141
01:12:06.78 --> 01:12:08.62
It's for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

1142
01:12:08.62 --> 01:12:10.38
That's what we're doing over here.

1143
01:12:10.38 --> 01:12:16.26
That's what the, that's what Western culture is about.

1144
01:12:16.26 --> 01:12:17.42
Yeah.

1145
01:12:17.42 --> 01:12:21.50
And you know the fact that you have all this code written and everything right, you have

1146
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:23.90
these people raised the bushydo mindset and all that.

1147
01:12:23.90 --> 01:12:28.94
But like the marines are going on to the beach at Guadalcanal.

1148
01:12:28.94 --> 01:12:30.22
Yeah.

1149
01:12:30.22 --> 01:12:32.30
That's what's going to happen.

1150
01:12:32.30 --> 01:12:39.38
And going into a fortified island, you're at a complete disadvantage.

1151
01:12:39.38 --> 01:12:43.10
Don't, don't, don't let anyone forget that.

1152
01:12:43.10 --> 01:12:47.34
When you're going again, when you're on the offense against a defensive position, you

1153
01:12:47.34 --> 01:12:49.58
are at a complete disadvantage.

1154
01:12:49.58 --> 01:12:51.46
That's the way it is.

1155
01:12:51.46 --> 01:13:02.02
And so this, this warrior culture that sometimes we put up on a pedestal because it sounds

1156
01:13:02.02 --> 01:13:04.14
cool.

1157
01:13:04.14 --> 01:13:05.14
It sounds cool.

1158
01:13:05.14 --> 01:13:10.90
The imperial rescript sounds cool when you put this code out, right?

1159
01:13:10.90 --> 01:13:14.46
But what you, what you just said is correct.

1160
01:13:14.46 --> 01:13:23.74
And that code is not based and not the foundation of it isn't freedom.

1161
01:13:23.74 --> 01:13:25.78
It doesn't turn out good.

1162
01:13:25.78 --> 01:13:26.78
Yeah.

1163
01:13:26.78 --> 01:13:32.46
And it's essentially like it sounds cool because you know how you, it kind of ties

1164
01:13:32.46 --> 01:13:33.46
into it or you, okay.

1165
01:13:33.46 --> 01:13:34.66
So this line equals freedom.

1166
01:13:34.66 --> 01:13:35.66
We'll say, right.

1167
01:13:35.66 --> 01:13:36.66
We'll start with that.

1168
01:13:36.66 --> 01:13:37.66
You can say that.

1169
01:13:37.66 --> 01:13:40.74
So this is a plain sounds cool and equals freedom.

1170
01:13:40.74 --> 01:13:42.22
That whole thing sounds cool whatever.

1171
01:13:42.22 --> 01:13:45.58
So this Bouchito thing kind of just seems like just the discipline part.

1172
01:13:45.58 --> 01:13:49.22
So of course that part of it sounds cool, but when you look at big picture, you know how

1173
01:13:49.22 --> 01:13:50.54
not cool that is?

1174
01:13:50.54 --> 01:13:51.54
Yeah.

1175
01:13:51.54 --> 01:13:56.46
Especially like to have to bow down to like some group of people that's the way it is.

1176
01:13:56.46 --> 01:13:57.46
Exactly.

1177
01:13:57.46 --> 01:13:58.46
Yeah.

1178
01:13:58.46 --> 01:13:59.46
So you step back, you look at that.

1179
01:13:59.46 --> 01:14:01.06
You're like, man, this isn't cool.

1180
01:14:01.06 --> 01:14:03.10
Actually this is like kind of bad.

1181
01:14:03.10 --> 01:14:10.54
Especially when you get corruption, which is kind of, it's one of the, I forget the same,

1182
01:14:10.54 --> 01:14:13.54
but it's like absolute power is absolutely.

1183
01:14:13.54 --> 01:14:14.54
Absolutely.

1184
01:14:14.54 --> 01:14:15.54
Yeah.

1185
01:14:15.54 --> 01:14:16.54
Yeah.

1186
01:14:16.54 --> 01:14:20.10
So the man, so you kind of consider that and that's a big picture thing too.

1187
01:14:20.10 --> 01:14:21.50
Because no one knows about it.

1188
01:14:21.50 --> 01:14:24.98
I mean, I was saying no one comes out of the gate crap, but that's not true either.

1189
01:14:24.98 --> 01:14:28.38
But when you can have something like this where it's like, hey, the emperor there, you

1190
01:14:28.38 --> 01:14:32.50
know, they're benevolent, they're defined, you know, all this stuff or whatever.

1191
01:14:32.50 --> 01:14:36.90
And it's like, yeah, okay, that sounds cool, but man, after a while, big picture, you're like,

1192
01:14:36.90 --> 01:14:41.66
okay, I'm well, you're not divine, you're just a person and the whole absolute power

1193
01:14:41.66 --> 01:14:45.30
crept us absolutely, it's like that's a very high likelihood and all this stuff.

1194
01:14:45.30 --> 01:14:50.70
So given that, that they can just say whatever they want, they can be like, hey, I don't

1195
01:14:50.70 --> 01:14:53.22
care 18 year old kid out of high school or whatever.

1196
01:14:53.22 --> 01:14:55.42
Oh, yeah, we need to use you as a bullet.

1197
01:14:55.42 --> 01:14:57.22
That's really what they're doing.

1198
01:14:57.22 --> 01:15:01.54
Especially like the numbers, the numbers are like, bro, you killed one Japanese person

1199
01:15:01.54 --> 01:15:04.94
for like every one point, something other person, like enemy.

1200
01:15:04.94 --> 01:15:09.70
So it's like, about two bullets are worth more than you, really, in a way, you know, and

1201
01:15:09.70 --> 01:15:14.34
some like person can just sort of make that determination with your whole life.

1202
01:15:14.34 --> 01:15:16.66
I don't know, man, that doesn't sound good.

1203
01:15:16.66 --> 01:15:23.62
Yeah, and that's why this whole, this whole thing, this, it just boils down to, it just

1204
01:15:23.62 --> 01:15:26.10
boils down to, and it's such an overuse word, man.

1205
01:15:26.10 --> 01:15:28.14
It boils down to freedom.

1206
01:15:28.14 --> 01:15:30.30
That's what it boils down to.

1207
01:15:30.30 --> 01:15:37.34
Like when you are a man and you're from Iowa and you're in the Marine Corps and you're

1208
01:15:37.34 --> 01:15:47.18
going on to that beach, you're will as a free man is stronger than the will of this guy

1209
01:15:47.18 --> 01:15:49.50
over on the other side.

1210
01:15:49.50 --> 01:15:52.62
That is not truly free.

1211
01:15:52.62 --> 01:15:58.62
And that, that right there, that's the, that's the crazy thing about this is you can

1212
01:15:58.62 --> 01:16:06.06
take this, this entire warrior culture where these people are born and raised and caught

1213
01:16:06.06 --> 01:16:07.54
this.

1214
01:16:07.54 --> 01:16:13.46
And you see, you know, there's there's training videos for the Kamikaze, but even just

1215
01:16:13.46 --> 01:16:19.42
the, just the militant life that these, the militaristic life that they led.

1216
01:16:19.42 --> 01:16:25.58
And meanwhile, you take someone that was a shoe cobbler in Boston and you take another guy

1217
01:16:25.58 --> 01:16:32.78
that was a farmer in Iowa and you take another guy that worked on the railroad in California

1218
01:16:32.78 --> 01:16:42.58
and you put them together in a foxhole and there will to fight as free men is stronger than

1219
01:16:42.58 --> 01:16:52.18
someone that was raised since birth to be a warrior, freedom and the individual human will

1220
01:16:52.18 --> 01:16:58.62
to do what you want to do with your life as such is the most powerful force and it gets left,

1221
01:16:58.62 --> 01:17:00.62
it gets left behind.

1222
01:17:00.62 --> 01:17:03.70
And if you leave it behind, you might win for a little while, but you're not going to win

1223
01:17:03.70 --> 01:17:06.78
in the long run.

1224
01:17:06.78 --> 01:17:13.38
And that's the, that's the force, if you take that to a personal level, that's the force

1225
01:17:13.38 --> 01:17:20.34
that you can use to drive discipline in your life because you want, you, you don't impose

1226
01:17:20.34 --> 01:17:23.54
discipline on yourself for, for the sake of discipline.

1227
01:17:23.54 --> 01:17:24.54
Yeah.

1228
01:17:24.54 --> 01:17:27.42
That's going to be, you can, you can, you can do that, you can do that today, you can

1229
01:17:27.42 --> 01:17:29.62
do that tomorrow, you can do that next week.

1230
01:17:29.62 --> 01:17:34.58
But you can't do that for two years, three years.

1231
01:17:34.58 --> 01:17:43.94
You need, it needs to be the foundation of the discipline needs to be the desire for freedom.

1232
01:17:43.94 --> 01:17:45.46
That's what it has to be rooted in.

1233
01:17:45.46 --> 01:17:47.66
At least that's for me.

1234
01:17:47.66 --> 01:17:49.46
For me, that's what it's rooted in.

1235
01:17:49.46 --> 01:17:50.46
Yeah.

1236
01:17:50.46 --> 01:17:54.46
And like, okay, discipline for the sake of discipline, that sounds cool.

1237
01:17:54.46 --> 01:17:55.46
Yeah.

1238
01:17:55.46 --> 01:17:56.46
Right.

1239
01:17:56.46 --> 01:17:57.46
Sounds awesome.

1240
01:17:57.46 --> 01:17:58.46
Dig into it a little bit.

1241
01:17:58.46 --> 01:17:59.46
Right.

1242
01:17:59.46 --> 01:18:00.46
Not big.

1243
01:18:00.46 --> 01:18:01.46
Dig into it a little bit.

1244
01:18:01.46 --> 01:18:02.46
And what do you find?

1245
01:18:02.46 --> 01:18:05.46
It's got to be discipline for freedom.

1246
01:18:05.46 --> 01:18:11.46
And it's, and it's, it's functional on the battlefield.

1247
01:18:11.46 --> 01:18:17.46
And it's functional in your life.

1248
01:18:17.46 --> 01:18:20.86
You know, it's the same thing with the same thing with the Nazis.

1249
01:18:20.86 --> 01:18:27.38
The Nazis were a martial culture.

1250
01:18:27.38 --> 01:18:30.10
You know, that's what they were.

1251
01:18:30.10 --> 01:18:33.54
But they were subservient to the fear.

1252
01:18:33.54 --> 01:18:35.02
And guess what happens?

1253
01:18:35.02 --> 01:18:41.82
When you take, guess what happens when you take a kid from North Carolina.

1254
01:18:41.82 --> 01:18:44.22
And you take another kid from Florida.

1255
01:18:44.22 --> 01:18:47.94
You take another kid from Tennessee.

1256
01:18:47.94 --> 01:18:49.26
And you take those kids.

1257
01:18:49.26 --> 01:18:51.10
They're not professional soldiers.

1258
01:18:51.10 --> 01:18:52.78
They're going to go to boot camp.

1259
01:18:52.78 --> 01:18:55.14
They're going to get trained in whatever they're going to get trained in.

1260
01:18:55.14 --> 01:18:56.14
They're not right.

1261
01:18:56.14 --> 01:18:59.62
They're not Hitler youth raised to fight.

1262
01:18:59.62 --> 01:19:04.46
You ever seen little little Hitler youth training with weapons when they're 12 years old?

1263
01:19:04.46 --> 01:19:07.34
Like meanwhile, this kid was in Tennessee, working on a farm.

1264
01:19:07.34 --> 01:19:13.70
This other kid was in Brooklyn, working in a pizza shop, working on a restaurant, whatever.

1265
01:19:13.70 --> 01:19:21.18
So you take these folks that are fighting for the fearer.

1266
01:19:21.18 --> 01:19:28.02
And you put them up against someone that a group of people that are fighting for freedom.

1267
01:19:28.02 --> 01:19:32.62
And freedom is going to win.

1268
01:19:32.62 --> 01:19:34.22
You're right about it.

1269
01:19:34.22 --> 01:19:38.34
Yeah, it's interesting.

1270
01:19:38.34 --> 01:19:40.70
Like the freedom to do jiu-jitsu by the way.

1271
01:19:40.70 --> 01:19:44.14
And the freedom to get any kind of gui-y-y-one.

1272
01:19:44.14 --> 01:19:45.42
You're going to get the best gui.

1273
01:19:45.42 --> 01:19:46.42
So I don't know.

1274
01:19:46.42 --> 01:19:47.42
Squallified is a rough transition.

1275
01:19:47.42 --> 01:19:52.66
Well, I'm just saying that's the first thing they came to mind at that point when you

1276
01:19:52.66 --> 01:19:55.54
said that nonetheless, anyway, we're on the path.

1277
01:19:55.54 --> 01:19:56.54
Yes, discipline.

1278
01:19:56.54 --> 01:20:03.02
The path is the path of discipline that ends in, not ends in, but results in freedom.

1279
01:20:03.02 --> 01:20:04.02
Yeah.

1280
01:20:04.02 --> 01:20:10.26
So on this path, many activities, many things to do and to not do, by the way.

1281
01:20:10.26 --> 01:20:13.62
And you know what you were talking about earlier with this salute thing.

1282
01:20:13.62 --> 01:20:14.62
Yes.

1283
01:20:14.62 --> 01:20:16.62
Look at that for a second.

1284
01:20:16.62 --> 01:20:17.62
Right?

1285
01:20:17.62 --> 01:20:20.62
If I'm a guy that's like, has an attitude.

1286
01:20:20.62 --> 01:20:22.82
Look, I'm not salute anyone.

1287
01:20:22.82 --> 01:20:24.82
Yeah.

1288
01:20:24.82 --> 01:20:26.22
I'm not disciplining myself.

1289
01:20:26.22 --> 01:20:27.22
Well, guess what?

1290
01:20:27.22 --> 01:20:29.10
Then I'm not going to do anything in the military.

1291
01:20:29.10 --> 01:20:30.54
I'm going to get kicked out of the military, actually.

1292
01:20:30.54 --> 01:20:33.38
I'm going to lose the freedom to serve.

1293
01:20:33.38 --> 01:20:36.18
Whereas if you discipline yourself like, hey, I'm going to show respect to the people

1294
01:20:36.18 --> 01:20:38.74
that are above me and the chain of command, I'm going to do a good job.

1295
01:20:38.74 --> 01:20:39.74
Yeah.

1296
01:20:39.74 --> 01:20:40.74
I'm going to discipline myself.

1297
01:20:40.74 --> 01:20:41.74
Yes, what?

1298
01:20:41.74 --> 01:20:42.74
It's ridiculous.

1299
01:20:42.74 --> 01:20:47.70
This is going to sound so ridiculous.

1300
01:20:47.70 --> 01:20:53.82
For the most part, I could pretty much do whatever I wanted to when I was in the military.

1301
01:20:53.82 --> 01:20:55.82
As crazy as that sounds.

1302
01:20:55.82 --> 01:20:57.66
As crazy as that sounds.

1303
01:20:57.66 --> 01:21:00.82
My boss is always gave me what I wanted.

1304
01:21:00.82 --> 01:21:05.42
My, I could just kind of do what I wanted to do.

1305
01:21:05.42 --> 01:21:07.14
It was crazy.

1306
01:21:07.14 --> 01:21:09.70
It was crazy when I looked back on it now.

1307
01:21:09.70 --> 01:21:13.22
And my bosses would give me what I want and help me and support me.

1308
01:21:13.22 --> 01:21:14.22
Why did they do that?

1309
01:21:14.22 --> 01:21:15.74
They didn't do it because I was manipulating.

1310
01:21:15.74 --> 01:21:19.14
They did it because I was working hard and supporting what they wanted to get done.

1311
01:21:19.14 --> 01:21:21.10
And it's like a positive thing.

1312
01:21:21.10 --> 01:21:22.10
It's not negative at all.

1313
01:21:22.10 --> 01:21:24.82
It's like it was awesome.

1314
01:21:24.82 --> 01:21:29.10
But if you, and if you have that attitude in life, like, hey, I'm going to work hard,

1315
01:21:29.10 --> 01:21:33.46
I'm going to discipline myself.

1316
01:21:33.46 --> 01:21:38.70
I'm going to submit in situations that require it.

1317
01:21:38.70 --> 01:21:43.90
I'm going to subordinate my ego in situations that require it now.

1318
01:21:43.90 --> 01:21:49.62
So that in the long run, I can get the freedom.

1319
01:21:49.62 --> 01:21:53.78
So often people, they don't want to, they want the freedom right now.

1320
01:21:53.78 --> 01:21:55.46
Freedom isn't going to come right now.

1321
01:21:55.46 --> 01:21:57.18
You don't get it.

1322
01:21:57.18 --> 01:21:59.66
You have to work for it.

1323
01:21:59.66 --> 01:22:01.46
You have to fight for it.

1324
01:22:01.46 --> 01:22:06.18
You have to impose discipline on your life so that you can end up with it.

1325
01:22:06.18 --> 01:22:08.78
You have to work hard.

1326
01:22:08.78 --> 01:22:14.38
You have to work hard to get to a point when you get the freedom.

1327
01:22:14.38 --> 01:22:18.54
But if you don't work hard, you won't end up with it.

1328
01:22:18.54 --> 01:22:19.54
You just won't.

1329
01:22:19.54 --> 01:22:24.98
You'll always end up being a slave to your paycheck.

1330
01:22:24.98 --> 01:22:29.38
You'll be a slave to your jacked up friends.

1331
01:22:29.38 --> 01:22:34.50
You'll be a slave to the manipulative partner you chose.

1332
01:22:34.50 --> 01:22:38.54
You'll be a slave if you don't put discipline in your world.

1333
01:22:38.54 --> 01:22:39.54
You'll be a slave to drugs.

1334
01:22:39.54 --> 01:22:41.54
You'll be a slave to alcohol.

1335
01:22:41.54 --> 01:22:42.74
You can be a slave to food.

1336
01:22:42.74 --> 01:22:43.90
You can be a slave to doctors.

1337
01:22:43.90 --> 01:22:48.02
Yeah, you can be a slave to all these things.

1338
01:22:48.02 --> 01:22:52.66
So it's just you got to think about freedom.

1339
01:22:52.66 --> 01:22:54.62
You got to have that in the back of your mind.

1340
01:22:54.62 --> 01:22:58.86
But you can't live your life thinking that it's going to be given to you.

1341
01:22:58.86 --> 01:22:59.86
Oh, free.

1342
01:22:59.86 --> 01:23:00.86
No, it's not.

1343
01:23:00.86 --> 01:23:02.58
Freedom isn't free, as they say.

1344
01:23:02.58 --> 01:23:07.74
As this freedom isn't free in a country.

1345
01:23:07.74 --> 01:23:09.82
And freedom certainly isn't free in your own personal life.

1346
01:23:09.82 --> 01:23:10.82
It's not free.

1347
01:23:10.82 --> 01:23:11.82
Oh, no.

1348
01:23:11.82 --> 01:23:17.70
Yeah, like we talked about this earlier on where you're going to have to pay the price.

1349
01:23:17.70 --> 01:23:20.70
You know, when you know, pay now, pay later, whatever.

1350
01:23:20.70 --> 01:23:21.70
You say.

1351
01:23:21.70 --> 01:23:27.14
So the whole pain now, I think that's the way to go.

1352
01:23:27.14 --> 01:23:28.70
Paying now is definitely the way to go.

1353
01:23:28.70 --> 01:23:29.70
Yeah.

1354
01:23:29.70 --> 01:23:31.50
Yeah, you always got to pay.

1355
01:23:31.50 --> 01:23:32.86
And it's a constant thing.

1356
01:23:32.86 --> 01:23:36.70
And that that part can kind of be intimidating, you know, where it's like, like, let's say,

1357
01:23:36.70 --> 01:23:41.46
you know, the real obvious one, it's like eating correctly and exercising.

1358
01:23:41.46 --> 01:23:42.46
Right.

1359
01:23:42.46 --> 01:23:43.46
Like that's.

1360
01:23:43.46 --> 01:23:48.58
Well, what's good about those is they, their physical activities that have physical

1361
01:23:48.58 --> 01:23:51.34
visible manifestations, right?

1362
01:23:51.34 --> 01:23:54.54
If you eat like crap, you're going to feel like crap, you're going to look like

1363
01:23:54.54 --> 01:23:56.50
crap, you're going to perform by crap.

1364
01:23:56.50 --> 01:23:57.50
Yeah.

1365
01:23:57.50 --> 01:24:01.34
If you are inactive, you're going to move like crap.

1366
01:24:01.34 --> 01:24:03.94
You're going to be sick.

1367
01:24:03.94 --> 01:24:06.10
So yeah, those are real clear.

1368
01:24:06.10 --> 01:24:07.10
Yeah.

1369
01:24:07.10 --> 01:24:08.10
So examples.

1370
01:24:08.10 --> 01:24:12.58
So it's like so clear where you can be like, okay, I'm going to pay now.

1371
01:24:12.58 --> 01:24:13.58
Right.

1372
01:24:13.58 --> 01:24:15.50
How am I going to pay now and what price am I going to pay now?

1373
01:24:15.50 --> 01:24:21.82
And that's with like, yeah, not eating things that you're so physically compelled to, yeah,

1374
01:24:21.82 --> 01:24:27.22
for the most part, exercising, which can be a pain literally.

1375
01:24:27.22 --> 01:24:31.30
And so, you know, most of the time you don't like,

1376
01:24:31.30 --> 01:24:36.42
want to exit like that's not a natural thing, I think, to like, I would say that's

1377
01:24:36.42 --> 01:24:37.42
true.

1378
01:24:37.42 --> 01:24:39.78
I would say actually your right, I would say that you're right to the point where

1379
01:24:39.78 --> 01:24:44.82
a normal human being is genetically programmed if they can conserve energy, then you

1380
01:24:44.82 --> 01:24:46.26
want to conserve energy.

1381
01:24:46.26 --> 01:24:49.66
Because otherwise, if you didn't have that instinct, you would waste all your energy

1382
01:24:49.66 --> 01:24:51.46
as a caveman and you would die, right?

1383
01:24:51.46 --> 01:24:52.62
Because you starve to death.

1384
01:24:52.62 --> 01:24:59.10
So no, I think we're genetically programmed to to lean towards less activity.

1385
01:24:59.10 --> 01:25:00.10
Yeah.

1386
01:25:00.10 --> 01:25:05.10
Our energy conservation is what we're probably genetically programmed to do.

1387
01:25:05.10 --> 01:25:06.10
Yeah.

1388
01:25:06.10 --> 01:25:07.10
Yeah, genetic.

1389
01:25:07.10 --> 01:25:09.70
Now you get it if you're sitting in an office all day and then you're like,

1390
01:25:09.70 --> 01:25:11.02
we're going to go for run tonight.

1391
01:25:11.02 --> 01:25:12.02
Yeah, of course.

1392
01:25:12.02 --> 01:25:13.22
Yes, sitting in an office all day.

1393
01:25:13.22 --> 01:25:16.22
So there's got to be some instinct to do that as well.

1394
01:25:16.22 --> 01:25:21.10
But yeah, but most time too, though, if you're going to go for a run or go lift or something,

1395
01:25:21.10 --> 01:25:24.66
like you're already familiar with like the payoff of that.

1396
01:25:24.66 --> 01:25:25.66
Yeah.

1397
01:25:25.66 --> 01:25:27.46
No, it's pretty rare.

1398
01:25:27.46 --> 01:25:31.38
Maybe if you want to go plant plant the pool or something, I guess.

1399
01:25:31.38 --> 01:25:32.38
But that's different.

1400
01:25:32.38 --> 01:25:39.62
Like, no one's just genetically yearning to go do a met con or something, run like a marathon or something.

1401
01:25:39.62 --> 01:25:40.62
Like that.

1402
01:25:40.62 --> 01:25:42.14
Well, that's why I kind of threw that out there a little bit.

1403
01:25:42.14 --> 01:25:48.46
Because sometimes if you, for me, yeah, like sometimes for you, no, but but for real, right?

1404
01:25:48.46 --> 01:25:51.22
Let's say you could work out for two days.

1405
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:53.90
Do you have like a little like thing that's bad.

1406
01:25:53.90 --> 01:25:55.54
I can't even get their jerks up.

1407
01:25:55.54 --> 01:25:56.54
Yeah, big time.

1408
01:25:56.54 --> 01:26:00.78
But then, so there's right, but that's for someone who's already collecting that payoff.

1409
01:26:00.78 --> 01:26:01.78
Okay, I got it.

1410
01:26:01.78 --> 01:26:05.46
And it's like, and he goes to, and we talked about this too, where that's kind of the same.

1411
01:26:05.46 --> 01:26:08.14
Sometimes you just don't, don't you just like to just go get something.

1412
01:26:08.14 --> 01:26:09.14
Yes.

1413
01:26:09.14 --> 01:26:10.86
But only for the payoff.

1414
01:26:10.86 --> 01:26:12.50
Something like to get some just to get something.

1415
01:26:12.50 --> 01:26:13.50
Oh, because we're you.

1416
01:26:13.50 --> 01:26:21.66
Well, and that's like, I was going to say that that's like one of the benefits of working.

1417
01:26:21.66 --> 01:26:25.02
And this is, we're just talking about working out with this goes for kind of everything, where

1418
01:26:25.02 --> 01:26:29.66
if you familiarize yourself over the years of the payoff, like your body kind of accommodates

1419
01:26:29.66 --> 01:26:33.94
that, like your body's like, if you don't, you get a door fence and you get addicted to it.

1420
01:26:33.94 --> 01:26:34.94
Yeah, right?

1421
01:26:34.94 --> 01:26:35.94
And that's how we're talking about.

1422
01:26:35.94 --> 01:26:37.30
Yeah, that becomes how you work.

1423
01:26:37.30 --> 01:26:41.22
But let's say, like, okay, let's say I'm, I don't know, 35 years old will say, I've never

1424
01:26:41.22 --> 01:26:42.22
really worked out ever.

1425
01:26:42.22 --> 01:26:43.22
Right?

1426
01:26:43.22 --> 01:26:44.22
Just live a normal life.

1427
01:26:44.22 --> 01:26:46.34
What I just never really worked out, never like lifted weights.

1428
01:26:46.34 --> 01:26:47.34
Never went for run.

1429
01:26:47.34 --> 01:26:50.34
You'll have less of a desire than someone that's been working out their whole life.

1430
01:26:50.34 --> 01:26:52.42
Should I go work out for the first time, a hard one?

1431
01:26:52.42 --> 01:26:54.14
Do you want to jocos work out?

1432
01:26:54.14 --> 01:26:55.14
You can be like, I don't want to do this.

1433
01:26:55.14 --> 01:26:56.14
I don't want to do this.

1434
01:26:56.14 --> 01:27:00.50
You're going to be thinking that while you're doing it and the next day when you're all

1435
01:27:00.50 --> 01:27:03.30
sorry, you can be like, I don't want to do that ever again, actually.

1436
01:27:03.30 --> 01:27:04.30
So it's different.

1437
01:27:04.30 --> 01:27:08.22
But if you're you or someone who's like, you know, an athlete all their life or something

1438
01:27:08.22 --> 01:27:16.66
like that, someone who who reap the benefits, they know they're familiar with with the payoff.

1439
01:27:16.66 --> 01:27:21.66
Yes, when you don't work out for one day, two days, what, you know, however many days,

1440
01:27:21.66 --> 01:27:26.30
you can be like, your body's going to be like, hey, we need that workout now.

1441
01:27:26.30 --> 01:27:27.30
Kind of thing.

1442
01:27:27.30 --> 01:27:30.70
For short term, short term payoff, we need that workout.

1443
01:27:30.70 --> 01:27:36.18
So again, the benefit of getting into working on a regular basis, you get short term

1444
01:27:36.18 --> 01:27:39.66
and long term payoff.

1445
01:27:39.66 --> 01:27:42.18
And that's what the path is by the way.

1446
01:27:42.18 --> 01:27:44.78
Anyway, same thing for jitsu, jitsu, it's a big one.

1447
01:27:44.78 --> 01:27:48.10
If you take off, you did like, you've been out of jiu jitsu for a little bit because you're

1448
01:27:48.10 --> 01:27:49.70
yeah, yeah, you're hurting right now.

1449
01:27:49.70 --> 01:27:51.70
I'm just walking it.

1450
01:27:51.70 --> 01:27:52.70
Yeah, I just walked out to the gym.

1451
01:27:52.70 --> 01:27:53.70
I kind of looked at Matt.

1452
01:27:53.70 --> 01:27:54.70
I got all excited.

1453
01:27:54.70 --> 01:27:55.70
Yeah.

1454
01:27:55.70 --> 01:27:56.70
You should be back.

1455
01:27:56.70 --> 01:27:57.70
I'll be back.

1456
01:27:57.70 --> 01:27:58.70
You'll be back in a week.

1457
01:27:58.70 --> 01:27:59.70
Right.

1458
01:27:59.70 --> 01:28:00.70
Well, no, sorry, two weeks.

1459
01:28:00.70 --> 01:28:01.70
I'll be back on the Matt's of justice.

1460
01:28:01.70 --> 01:28:02.70
Boom.

1461
01:28:02.70 --> 01:28:03.70
There it is.

1462
01:28:03.70 --> 01:28:07.70
So while you're doing jitsu, if you haven't started jitsu, if you haven't, like, because

1463
01:28:07.70 --> 01:28:12.70
you know, there's a number of people who are like, hey, I hear the things, I'm on the fence.

1464
01:28:12.70 --> 01:28:15.70
You know, they just haven't made the plans.

1465
01:28:15.70 --> 01:28:18.70
They haven't taken the step to even just try it because usually, please, if you go, they'll

1466
01:28:18.70 --> 01:28:19.70
give you it's free.

1467
01:28:19.70 --> 01:28:20.70
Yeah.

1468
01:28:20.70 --> 01:28:21.70
Try for free.

1469
01:28:21.70 --> 01:28:22.70
Yeah.

1470
01:28:22.70 --> 01:28:27.70
That's which tells you that jitsu is good because they don't say, hey, try this for free.

1471
01:28:27.70 --> 01:28:28.70
They don't try and get your money.

1472
01:28:28.70 --> 01:28:29.70
Oh, yeah.

1473
01:28:29.70 --> 01:28:30.70
Just like, come on in.

1474
01:28:30.70 --> 01:28:31.70
Yeah.

1475
01:28:31.70 --> 01:28:33.70
It's like giving away free crack at the school yard.

1476
01:28:33.70 --> 01:28:34.70
Yeah.

1477
01:28:34.70 --> 01:28:35.70
But it's the good kind.

1478
01:28:35.70 --> 01:28:36.70
No.

1479
01:28:36.70 --> 01:28:38.70
We actually have for it's crack that makes you, like, a better human being.

1480
01:28:38.70 --> 01:28:40.70
That's basically what jitsu is.

1481
01:28:40.70 --> 01:28:41.70
It's like a car.

1482
01:28:41.70 --> 01:28:47.70
It's like an addictive drug that makes you better, stronger, smarter, faster, more calm,

1483
01:28:47.70 --> 01:28:48.70
more patient.

1484
01:28:48.70 --> 01:28:50.70
Just a better person.

1485
01:28:50.70 --> 01:28:53.70
Bring more to your perspective.

1486
01:28:53.70 --> 01:28:54.70
That's for sure.

1487
01:28:54.70 --> 01:28:55.70
It opens up your perspective.

1488
01:28:55.70 --> 01:28:56.70
Big toe.

1489
01:28:56.70 --> 01:28:57.70
Yeah.

1490
01:28:57.70 --> 01:29:02.70
So there's people, if what you're saying is correct, and there's someone right now that's on the fence,

1491
01:29:02.70 --> 01:29:03.70
should I or should I not?

1492
01:29:03.70 --> 01:29:04.70
Maybe I should.

1493
01:29:04.70 --> 01:29:05.70
Maybe I won't like it.

1494
01:29:05.70 --> 01:29:06.70
I don't know.

1495
01:29:06.70 --> 01:29:07.70
It's sweaty dudes.

1496
01:29:07.70 --> 01:29:08.70
I don't disco train.

1497
01:29:08.70 --> 01:29:09.70
Go for free.

1498
01:29:09.70 --> 01:29:10.70
Yes.

1499
01:29:10.70 --> 01:29:11.70
Go for free.

1500
01:29:11.70 --> 01:29:12.70
Try the one day.

1501
01:29:12.70 --> 01:29:14.70
You can even, I would even say, go try the one day with it.

1502
01:29:14.70 --> 01:29:16.70
I mean, I would never recommend having a defense.

1503
01:29:16.70 --> 01:29:18.70
It's a defensive attitude towards it.

1504
01:29:18.70 --> 01:29:20.70
I would never recommend that.

1505
01:29:20.70 --> 01:29:21.70
But Brad, it's better than I'm going to do.

1506
01:29:21.70 --> 01:29:22.70
Give yourself an attitude.

1507
01:29:22.70 --> 01:29:24.70
If you don't like it, go prove that it sucks.

1508
01:29:24.70 --> 01:29:25.70
Yes.

1509
01:29:25.70 --> 01:29:26.70
Okay.

1510
01:29:26.70 --> 01:29:26.70
Exactly.

1511
01:29:26.70 --> 01:29:27.70
Right.

1512
01:29:27.70 --> 01:29:28.70
Proove that it sucks.

1513
01:29:28.70 --> 01:29:28.70
Yes.

1514
01:29:28.70 --> 01:29:29.70
Exactly.

1515
01:29:29.70 --> 01:29:30.70
Yeah.

1516
01:29:30.70 --> 01:29:34.70
But when you fail to prove that it sucks, and you realize that it's awesome.

1517
01:29:34.70 --> 01:29:35.70
It is awesome.

1518
01:29:35.70 --> 01:29:36.70
You can be like, dang.

1519
01:29:36.70 --> 01:29:39.70
Where am I needed to get and besties?

1520
01:29:39.70 --> 01:29:41.70
Not only in America, in the world.

1521
01:29:41.70 --> 01:29:42.70
Yeah.

1522
01:29:42.70 --> 01:29:43.70
Factually worldwide.

1523
01:29:43.70 --> 01:29:44.70
They are made in America.

1524
01:29:44.70 --> 01:29:46.70
They are from origin.

1525
01:29:46.70 --> 01:29:49.70
So origin main.com is where you can get your geese.

1526
01:29:49.70 --> 01:29:51.70
There's other stuff on there.

1527
01:29:51.70 --> 01:29:52.70
Yeah.

1528
01:29:52.70 --> 01:29:53.70
Flashcards on there for no geese.

1529
01:29:53.70 --> 01:29:54.70
Flashcard for the geese too.

1530
01:29:54.70 --> 01:30:02.70
Also, when you're not on a geese too map, and you still want to have the comfort.

1531
01:30:02.70 --> 01:30:05.70
And the glory of American-made products.

1532
01:30:05.70 --> 01:30:07.70
You know, we talk a lot about freedom today.

1533
01:30:07.70 --> 01:30:13.70
Why not get a pair of jeans that were made under the umbrella of freedom right here in the United States of America?

1534
01:30:13.70 --> 01:30:18.70
Up in the great state of Maine, around here in America.

1535
01:30:18.70 --> 01:30:19.70
Right.

1536
01:30:19.70 --> 01:30:20.70
Why would you not do that?

1537
01:30:20.70 --> 01:30:26.70
So check out jeans, check out t-shirts, check out all that clothing.

1538
01:30:26.70 --> 01:30:34.70
And then also, if you want some supplements for your body, nutritional supplements,

1539
01:30:34.70 --> 01:30:40.70
if you're working out all the time, you're going to need some joy or a offer.

1540
01:30:40.70 --> 01:30:43.70
Joy or a offer helps your joints.

1541
01:30:43.70 --> 01:30:50.70
Criolloial also help your joints, and actually both those things also help your just overall life.

1542
01:30:50.70 --> 01:30:51.70
Yes.

1543
01:30:51.70 --> 01:30:54.70
Get on those discipline and discipline go.

1544
01:30:54.70 --> 01:30:57.70
Discipline is for me.

1545
01:30:57.70 --> 01:30:59.70
It's a pre-mission situation.

1546
01:30:59.70 --> 01:31:04.70
It's not, but don't get it confused with the traditional pre-workout.

1547
01:31:04.70 --> 01:31:06.70
Stimulate.

1548
01:31:06.70 --> 01:31:12.70
They get you all amped up by some, I was reading someone saying, oh, I don't want to take pre-workout before you get to.

1549
01:31:12.70 --> 01:31:14.70
That's a pre-workout.

1550
01:31:14.70 --> 01:31:21.70
And I don't recommend taking a pre-workout before you get to this has 15 milligrams of caffeine.

1551
01:31:21.70 --> 01:31:22.70
Because that's what people worry about.

1552
01:31:22.70 --> 01:31:23.70
My heart's going to be pumping.

1553
01:31:23.70 --> 01:31:24.70
Right.

1554
01:31:24.70 --> 01:31:25.70
No.

1555
01:31:25.70 --> 01:31:30.70
This is going to, it's going to get you cognitively and physically ready to rock and roll.

1556
01:31:30.70 --> 01:31:31.70
It's going to be primed.

1557
01:31:31.70 --> 01:31:40.70
And discipline go, which is the pill form, when you, when you need, imagine, okay, you know what you feel like when you're in the zone.

1558
01:31:40.70 --> 01:31:41.70
Right.

1559
01:31:41.70 --> 01:31:46.70
Just imagine you could get in the zone like basically on demand.

1560
01:31:46.70 --> 01:31:47.70
Sure.

1561
01:31:47.70 --> 01:31:49.70
That's what's happening here with discipline go.

1562
01:31:49.70 --> 01:31:52.70
You can feel it and it gets you in the zone.

1563
01:31:52.70 --> 01:31:57.70
It's, you know what trips me out is I'll take discipline.

1564
01:31:57.70 --> 01:32:01.70
I'll just go into, you know, speak with the company.

1565
01:32:01.70 --> 01:32:02.70
I'm going to be sitting down.

1566
01:32:02.70 --> 01:32:09.70
There's 20 like smart leaders in a room from a company.

1567
01:32:09.70 --> 01:32:12.70
They got a lot of stuff going on big company.

1568
01:32:12.70 --> 01:32:15.70
And I go in and I've got, I've got to be honest.

1569
01:32:15.70 --> 01:32:18.70
I'm like, do you stop on like three disclin gop.

1570
01:32:18.70 --> 01:32:19.70
You're ready to do that.

1571
01:32:19.70 --> 01:32:20.70
Sorry, Rock, roll.

1572
01:32:20.70 --> 01:32:24.70
But I get in there and I'm, I'm just feeling great, right?

1573
01:32:24.70 --> 01:32:26.70
And I get out of there.

1574
01:32:26.70 --> 01:32:30.70
And I'm like thinking myself, I'm like, you know, I should record it that.

1575
01:32:30.70 --> 01:32:32.70
There's no, I'm not kidding.

1576
01:32:32.70 --> 01:32:37.70
There's times where I go to, I work with a client and I think man, I should record it that.

1577
01:32:37.70 --> 01:32:40.70
I even do phone calls sometimes a client's been like, I should just record it.

1578
01:32:40.70 --> 01:32:41.70
My end.

1579
01:32:41.70 --> 01:32:42.70
Sure.

1580
01:32:42.70 --> 01:32:51.70
Because I'm telling people really important things about planning, about leadership, about decision-making.

1581
01:32:51.70 --> 01:32:52.70
And it's getting lost.

1582
01:32:52.70 --> 01:32:55.70
I mean, I told 20 people, what about everyone else I'm thinking of myself?

1583
01:32:55.70 --> 01:32:58.70
And I'm out of there and I think to myself, I'm like, I was just in the zone.

1584
01:32:58.70 --> 01:32:59.70
I wonder what happened.

1585
01:32:59.70 --> 01:33:03.70
I'm like, oh, I took three discipline goes and I'm ready to rock and roll.

1586
01:33:03.70 --> 01:33:04.70
That's what happened.

1587
01:33:04.70 --> 01:33:05.70
So anyways.

1588
01:33:05.70 --> 01:33:10.70
That sounds like you're like, all freaking, like, proud yourself.

1589
01:33:10.70 --> 01:33:11.70
Like, oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

1590
01:33:11.70 --> 01:33:12.70
I'm so good at what I do.

1591
01:33:12.70 --> 01:33:14.70
But I felt like I cheated.

1592
01:33:14.70 --> 01:33:15.70
But, no, no.

1593
01:33:15.70 --> 01:33:17.70
It actually makes sense though.

1594
01:33:17.70 --> 01:33:19.70
You know how like what you say when you're in the zone?

1595
01:33:19.70 --> 01:33:20.70
Right.

1596
01:33:20.70 --> 01:33:22.70
And you say, you know, like, I don't know even, like, in my case, like,

1597
01:33:22.70 --> 01:33:25.70
you're from my friend, who has me like a question.

1598
01:33:25.70 --> 01:33:29.70
And then I'll be like, wait, and I'll kind of cover all the aspects of the question,

1599
01:33:29.70 --> 01:33:32.70
like, all fluidly, and I'm like, dang, I kind of said that kind of good right there.

1600
01:33:32.70 --> 01:33:34.70
Not that I'm a great speaker, nothing like that.

1601
01:33:34.70 --> 01:33:38.70
But I'm just saying, given the question, he asked at the certain time and the way I answered

1602
01:33:38.70 --> 01:33:39.70
I really feel good about it.

1603
01:33:39.70 --> 01:33:40.70
I really feel good about it.

1604
01:33:40.70 --> 01:33:42.70
That's kind of like what you get into.

1605
01:33:42.70 --> 01:33:44.70
You take, you know, like, you take the discipline.

1606
01:33:44.70 --> 01:33:47.70
It's like, I, it's just, you just kind of flow with it.

1607
01:33:47.70 --> 01:33:49.70
Kind of like surfing or something.

1608
01:33:49.70 --> 01:33:50.70
I started to get a loan.

1609
01:33:50.70 --> 01:33:54.70
Like, is it possible to become addicted to that feeling?

1610
01:33:54.70 --> 01:33:56.70
Well, it depends on what kind of quote, what I'm going to get.

1611
01:33:56.70 --> 01:34:00.70
And he's talking about, because there's psychological addiction, yeah.

1612
01:34:00.70 --> 01:34:01.70
Yeah.

1613
01:34:01.70 --> 01:34:02.70
Like that's the thing.

1614
01:34:02.70 --> 01:34:03.70
But yeah.

1615
01:34:03.70 --> 01:34:04.70
Anyway, that's the discipline.

1616
01:34:04.70 --> 01:34:06.70
And that's the discipline go.

1617
01:34:06.70 --> 01:34:09.70
And then we got some milk.

1618
01:34:09.70 --> 01:34:11.70
And you know what, milk is?

1619
01:34:11.70 --> 01:34:12.70
Sure.

1620
01:34:12.70 --> 01:34:13.70
Yeah, it's more like.

1621
01:34:13.70 --> 01:34:14.70
Yeah.

1622
01:34:14.70 --> 01:34:17.70
Happen to have 22 grams of protein.

1623
01:34:17.70 --> 01:34:18.70
Yeah, yeah.

1624
01:34:18.70 --> 01:34:23.70
And by the way, men is my favorite kind of flavor overall in the world.

1625
01:34:23.70 --> 01:34:26.70
And I have not had men since I got strawberry at my house.

1626
01:34:26.70 --> 01:34:27.70
I got to be straight up.

1627
01:34:27.70 --> 01:34:29.70
Now, I'll get over it in a while.

1628
01:34:29.70 --> 01:34:30.70
You know what I mean?

1629
01:34:30.70 --> 01:34:33.70
But right now, it's just the hype is still the hype.

1630
01:34:33.70 --> 01:34:34.70
The strawberry, the strawberry.

1631
01:34:34.70 --> 01:34:35.70
The strawberry.

1632
01:34:35.70 --> 01:34:36.70
Yeah.

1633
01:34:36.70 --> 01:34:38.70
It doesn't seem to be a strawberry layer.

1634
01:34:38.70 --> 01:34:40.70
How good is it?

1635
01:34:40.70 --> 01:34:41.70
Anyway, yeah, that's that.

1636
01:34:41.70 --> 01:34:42.70
Get the milk.

1637
01:34:42.70 --> 01:34:43.70
Get the warrior milk.

1638
01:34:43.70 --> 01:34:44.70
For your kids.

1639
01:34:44.70 --> 01:34:46.70
Warrior kid milk.

1640
01:34:46.70 --> 01:34:48.70
It's that comes in strawberry and chocolate.

1641
01:34:48.70 --> 01:34:50.70
Once again, the strawberry is unreal.

1642
01:34:50.70 --> 01:34:51.70
The chocolate's fine.

1643
01:34:51.70 --> 01:34:52.70
It's good.

1644
01:34:52.70 --> 01:34:54.70
Your kids will like it.

1645
01:34:54.70 --> 01:34:56.70
The strawberry that will be coming back for more.

1646
01:34:56.70 --> 01:34:56.70
Yeah.

1647
01:34:56.70 --> 01:34:57.70
Right?

1648
01:34:57.70 --> 01:34:58.70
It's dessert.

1649
01:34:58.70 --> 01:35:03.70
And then of course, you got chocolate, which is good for you.

1650
01:35:03.70 --> 01:35:05.70
It tastes good.

1651
01:35:05.70 --> 01:35:09.70
And the most important thing is that it gives you an 8,000 pound deadlift,

1652
01:35:09.70 --> 01:35:12.70
which is not chubby.

1653
01:35:12.70 --> 01:35:13.70
No.

1654
01:35:13.70 --> 01:35:15.70
And it's 100% guaranteed, like 100%.

1655
01:35:15.70 --> 01:35:16.70
Yeah.

1656
01:35:16.70 --> 01:35:18.70
Like every single person that's ever had it.

1657
01:35:18.70 --> 01:35:19.70
Yep.

1658
01:35:19.70 --> 01:35:20.70
It has got an 8,000 pound death.

1659
01:35:20.70 --> 01:35:21.70
Yeah.

1660
01:35:21.70 --> 01:35:22.70
So we're good there.

1661
01:35:22.70 --> 01:35:23.70
I'll give that a try if you want.

1662
01:35:23.70 --> 01:35:24.70
Yeah.

1663
01:35:24.70 --> 01:35:25.70
Big time.

1664
01:35:25.70 --> 01:35:28.70
All that stuff that we just talked about is an origin main.com.

1665
01:35:28.70 --> 01:35:29.70
Yes.

1666
01:35:29.70 --> 01:35:30.70
If you want it.

1667
01:35:30.70 --> 01:35:32.70
And the T we offer the T is well.

1668
01:35:32.70 --> 01:35:33.70
Where on our store?

1669
01:35:33.70 --> 01:35:35.70
Oh, I didn't know we had a store.

1670
01:35:35.70 --> 01:35:36.70
Jocca, you do have a store.

1671
01:35:36.70 --> 01:35:38.70
It's called Jocca store.

1672
01:35:38.70 --> 01:35:39.70
Anyway, yes.

1673
01:35:39.70 --> 01:35:41.70
So yeah, Jocca store called Jocca store.

1674
01:35:41.70 --> 01:35:42.70
Dotcom.

1675
01:35:42.70 --> 01:35:44.70
This is where you can get.

1676
01:35:44.70 --> 01:35:48.70
A bunch of rash guards, T shirts, hats, stickers.

1677
01:35:48.70 --> 01:35:50.70
Pretty much anything that you want.

1678
01:35:50.70 --> 01:35:52.70
Do you want stickers in there right now?

1679
01:35:52.70 --> 01:35:53.70
We have sticker bumper sticker.

1680
01:35:53.70 --> 01:35:54.70
Okay.

1681
01:35:54.70 --> 01:35:55.70
I don't know if everyone knows that.

1682
01:35:55.70 --> 01:35:56.70
Yeah.

1683
01:35:56.70 --> 01:35:57.70
It could be sold out and we don't know it.

1684
01:35:57.70 --> 01:35:58.70
Tell Jesse.

1685
01:35:58.70 --> 01:35:59.70
Jesse will get him in the game.

1686
01:35:59.70 --> 01:36:00.70
No, no.

1687
01:36:00.70 --> 01:36:01.70
The decals.

1688
01:36:01.70 --> 01:36:01.70
Okay.

1689
01:36:01.70 --> 01:36:03.70
So the difference between bumper stickers and decals.

1690
01:36:03.70 --> 01:36:04.70
We have decals.

1691
01:36:04.70 --> 01:36:05.70
Oh.

1692
01:36:05.70 --> 01:36:07.70
Those are like more legitimate stickers.

1693
01:36:07.70 --> 01:36:08.70
Okay.

1694
01:36:08.70 --> 01:36:09.70
Cool.

1695
01:36:09.70 --> 01:36:10.70
That's the ones I like.

1696
01:36:10.70 --> 01:36:11.70
Yes.

1697
01:36:11.70 --> 01:36:12.70
Me too.

1698
01:36:12.70 --> 01:36:13.70
Big 10 on that level.

1699
01:36:13.70 --> 01:36:16.70
You know, the discipline equals freedom.

1700
01:36:16.70 --> 01:36:19.70
Like concept.

1701
01:36:19.70 --> 01:36:20.70
You know, a guy.

1702
01:36:20.70 --> 01:36:22.70
And this is just you should know this.

1703
01:36:22.70 --> 01:36:23.70
A guy.

1704
01:36:23.70 --> 01:36:26.70
There's I was speaking in an event and they were talking about like,

1705
01:36:26.70 --> 01:36:27.70
Oh, the guy.

1706
01:36:27.70 --> 01:36:29.70
We got some guys that are going to wear your t shirt.

1707
01:36:29.70 --> 01:36:30.70
You know.

1708
01:36:30.70 --> 01:36:32.70
And I was like, oh, that's awesome.

1709
01:36:32.70 --> 01:36:33.70
And the guy I was talking was kind of, I don't know.

1710
01:36:33.70 --> 01:36:36.70
He just had a look on his face like.

1711
01:36:36.70 --> 01:36:41.70
Like I was like saying, oh, it's so awesome that guys are wearing.

1712
01:36:41.70 --> 01:36:43.70
You know, the t shirt.

1713
01:36:43.70 --> 01:36:48.70
And so I said, I said, it's awesome because like that's how the podcast is supported.

1714
01:36:48.70 --> 01:36:52.70
It's like when you buy a t shirt, that's how the podcast is supported.

1715
01:36:52.70 --> 01:36:53.70
So it is cool.

1716
01:36:53.70 --> 01:37:01.70
And it's appreciated if you get a t shirt or a hat or a rash guard or whatever from the

1717
01:37:01.70 --> 01:37:05.70
Jocquist store, because then we can have the podcast.

1718
01:37:05.70 --> 01:37:06.70
Yeah.

1719
01:37:06.70 --> 01:37:07.70
And the good, good.

1720
01:37:07.70 --> 01:37:08.70
Good.

1721
01:37:08.70 --> 01:37:12.70
Good.

1722
01:37:12.70 --> 01:37:13.70
Good.

1723
01:37:13.70 --> 01:37:14.70
Good news about this too though.

1724
01:37:14.70 --> 01:37:16.70
It's not like the shirts and I said this from the beginning.

1725
01:37:16.70 --> 01:37:20.70
I think this was kind of the goal when you know when you make shirts and you produce shirts.

1726
01:37:20.70 --> 01:37:22.70
Yeah.

1727
01:37:22.70 --> 01:37:26.70
It's it seems obvious to be like, oh, yeah, let's just get some shirts.

1728
01:37:26.70 --> 01:37:27.70
No, no, no, no, no.

1729
01:37:27.70 --> 01:37:32.70
I made it a point to get like literally the shirts that like that I wear or that.

1730
01:37:32.70 --> 01:37:35.70
And which we're proving because I made shirts before in the past.

1731
01:37:35.70 --> 01:37:39.70
I've actually been making shirts themselves like six years old to be on the city.

1732
01:37:39.70 --> 01:37:42.70
So I find where you make shirts when you're six years old.

1733
01:37:42.70 --> 01:37:45.70
But I mean, like we explain that a little bit.

1734
01:37:45.70 --> 01:37:48.70
So you get shirt well, because it wasn't like you were running up silk screen.

1735
01:37:48.70 --> 01:37:49.70
Um, operation.

1736
01:37:49.70 --> 01:37:50.70
No, but my mom's a little.

1737
01:37:50.70 --> 01:37:53.70
Yes, my mom's a mom was making shirts when you were six years old.

1738
01:37:53.70 --> 01:37:55.70
Well, it kind of filtered down to us too.

1739
01:37:55.70 --> 01:37:57.70
So they did's airbrush.

1740
01:37:57.70 --> 01:37:58.70
They did silk screen.

1741
01:37:58.70 --> 01:37:59.70
They did.

1742
01:37:59.70 --> 01:38:03.70
I want to see some kid pictures of you with an airbrush t shirt.

1743
01:38:03.70 --> 01:38:06.70
Unicorn rainbow.

1744
01:38:06.70 --> 01:38:07.70
Shaka.

1745
01:38:07.70 --> 01:38:09.70
Shaka, maybe they're, I mean, a lot of flowers.

1746
01:38:09.70 --> 01:38:11.70
A lot of that kind of, it was on quite.

1747
01:38:11.70 --> 01:38:15.70
So there is a, she worked at a place called Tropical shirts.

1748
01:38:15.70 --> 01:38:17.70
Yes, on Hawaiian, low-y.

1749
01:38:17.70 --> 01:38:21.70
Um, right, they shared building with like a can or pineapple cannery.

1750
01:38:21.70 --> 01:38:23.70
I mean, make sure it was really interesting.

1751
01:38:23.70 --> 01:38:24.70
Anyway, that's where we learned.

1752
01:38:24.70 --> 01:38:27.70
Nonetheless, the point is, I mean, get some just random cheap.

1753
01:38:27.70 --> 01:38:28.70
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1754
01:38:28.70 --> 01:38:29.70
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1755
01:38:29.70 --> 01:38:34.70
So, where are bull shirts is many people. And when I say many, I mean, more than I can, I can't

1756
01:38:34.70 --> 01:38:36.70
recollect like a lot of people.

1757
01:38:36.70 --> 01:38:38.70
Actually, it's actually a lot of people.

1758
01:38:38.70 --> 01:38:40.70
Yeah, a lot of people tell me this too.

1759
01:38:40.70 --> 01:38:44.70
Yeah, that it's the most like their favorite shirt to wear because it fits so good.

1760
01:38:44.70 --> 01:38:45.70
It's like the soft and material.

1761
01:38:45.70 --> 01:38:48.70
It's not just like some rigid thing, you know.

1762
01:38:48.70 --> 01:38:49.70
They're good.

1763
01:38:49.70 --> 01:38:51.70
It's quality stuff is what I'm saying.

1764
01:38:51.70 --> 01:38:54.70
So, you know, Ben, beneficial in checks or that's.

1765
01:38:54.70 --> 01:38:55.70

1773
01:39:15.70 --> 01:39:17.70
The warrior kid podcast as well.

1774
01:39:17.70 --> 01:39:20.70
It's coming out a little bit infrequently right now.

1775
01:39:20.70 --> 01:39:22.70
But we are getting them out.

1776
01:39:22.70 --> 01:39:24.70
I'm working on another one right now.

1777
01:39:24.70 --> 01:39:27.70
There's plenty of lessons in there for everyone from Uncle Jake.

1778
01:39:27.70 --> 01:39:32.70
And then you can also get some more of your kids soap from Irish Oaks Ranch.com.

1779
01:39:32.70 --> 01:39:35.70
Also, we have a YouTube channel.

1780
01:39:35.70 --> 01:39:36.70
Yeah.

1781
01:39:36.70 --> 01:39:37.70
It's a good channel.

1782
01:39:37.70 --> 01:39:41.70
I think if you're interested in the video, version, that's mainly what it's for.

1783
01:39:41.70 --> 01:39:45.70
Also, there's some excerpts on there that we put out.

1784
01:39:45.70 --> 01:39:50.70
So you don't have to necessarily listen to the whole thing every single time.

1785
01:39:50.70 --> 01:39:51.70
Yeah.

1786
01:39:51.70 --> 01:39:58.70
But whenever I meet someone that has a commute more than 40 minutes to work in front of

1787
01:39:58.70 --> 01:40:01.70
them, they're completely caught up in the podcast.

1788
01:40:01.70 --> 01:40:06.70
When I meet someone that has a commute that's like 10 minutes, they're like, oh, you put

1789
01:40:06.70 --> 01:40:08.70
out these podcasts too fast.

1790
01:40:08.70 --> 01:40:11.70
And I say, well, listen, harg.

1791
01:40:11.70 --> 01:40:14.70
You know, because you can unsan some apps.

1792
01:40:14.70 --> 01:40:18.70
You can play it on the five or whatever to tend to speed.

1793
01:40:18.70 --> 01:40:22.70
I don't know that I would recommend that I've accidentally, you know, something to accidentally

1794
01:40:22.70 --> 01:40:23.70
press the button.

1795
01:40:23.70 --> 01:40:24.70
And it'll go faster.

1796
01:40:24.70 --> 01:40:25.70
It's kind of weird.

1797
01:40:25.70 --> 01:40:29.70
But if you're trying to rush it, you can try to get used to it too.

1798
01:40:29.70 --> 01:40:30.70
Yeah.

1799
01:40:30.70 --> 01:40:34.70
But then the thing is with me a lot of times, obviously, I speak really slow with big

1800
01:40:34.70 --> 01:40:35.70
giant pauses.

1801
01:40:35.70 --> 01:40:36.70
I'm sorry.

1802
01:40:36.70 --> 01:40:37.70
That's just the way I talk.

1803
01:40:37.70 --> 01:40:39.70
But then also sometimes I speak really quickly and put my words together.

1804
01:40:39.70 --> 01:40:40.70
And they kind of flow out.

1805
01:40:40.70 --> 01:40:44.70
If you were listening to this right now at 2.0 speed, you'd be in a world of hurt trying to

1806
01:40:44.70 --> 01:40:45.70
understand what I was talking about.

1807
01:40:45.70 --> 01:40:50.70
So that's when you got to be able to get back to that button hammer it down, get you to slow

1808
01:40:50.70 --> 01:40:53.70
back down to a normal speed of 1.0.

1809
01:40:53.70 --> 01:40:54.70
Oh, 1.0.

1810
01:40:54.70 --> 01:40:55.70
Yeah.

1811
01:40:55.70 --> 01:40:55.70
Sure.

1812
01:40:55.70 --> 01:40:56.70
But yeah.

1813
01:40:56.70 --> 01:40:57.70
Either way, YouTube.

1814
01:40:57.70 --> 01:40:58.70
Yes, YouTube.

1815
01:40:58.70 --> 01:41:00.70
It's a, we do have YouTube channels.

1816
01:41:00.70 --> 01:41:01.70
So yeah, check that out.

1817
01:41:01.70 --> 01:41:02.70
If you're interested in that one.

1818
01:41:02.70 --> 01:41:04.70
Also psychological warfare.

1819
01:41:04.70 --> 01:41:05.70
If you don't know what that is.

1820
01:41:05.70 --> 01:41:08.70
It's an album with tracks, chocolate tracks.

1821
01:41:08.70 --> 01:41:14.70
Getting us all through our moments of weakness if they become prevalent, which they do

1822
01:41:14.70 --> 01:41:15.70
sometime this time.

1823
01:41:15.70 --> 01:41:18.70
They do way less now, by the way.

1824
01:41:18.70 --> 01:41:23.70
But you know, those are on, wherever you can get an MP3, you can get the psychological

1825
01:41:23.70 --> 01:41:24.70
warfare album.

1826
01:41:24.70 --> 01:41:26.70
That's an audio.

1827
01:41:26.70 --> 01:41:29.70
It's an audio reminder.

1828
01:41:29.70 --> 01:41:36.70
If you want a visual reminder, you can go to flipsidecanvist.com.

1829
01:41:36.70 --> 01:41:39.70
Run by my brother Dakota Meyer.

1830
01:41:39.70 --> 01:41:43.70
He was on this podcast number 115.

1831
01:41:43.70 --> 01:41:46.70
He's made things that you can look at.

1832
01:41:46.70 --> 01:41:50.70
That say good things on them to remind you of what you should be doing.

1833
01:41:50.70 --> 01:41:55.70
He just made a new one that says all your excuses are lies.

1834
01:41:55.70 --> 01:41:56.70
I saw them.

1835
01:41:56.70 --> 01:41:59.70
There's no, they're not all fancy.

1836
01:41:59.70 --> 01:42:00.70
Yeah.

1837
01:42:00.70 --> 01:42:02.70
Because nothing fancy about all excuses are lies.

1838
01:42:02.70 --> 01:42:03.70
It's simple.

1839
01:42:03.70 --> 01:42:05.70
It's going for the simplicity element.

1840
01:42:05.70 --> 01:42:06.70
Yes.

1841
01:42:06.70 --> 01:42:07.70
Yes.

01:42:07.70 --> 01:42:09.70

Get some stuff to hang on your walls.

01:42:11.70 --> 01:42:15.70
Also made under the umbrella freedom here in America.

1845
01:42:15.70 --> 01:42:16.70
Yes, sir.

1846
01:42:16.70 --> 01:42:17.70
It is big time.

01:42:17.70 --> 01:42:20.70
Also on it on it.com slash jockel.

01:42:20.70 --> 01:42:23.70
This is where you can get workout gear.

1849
01:42:23.70 --> 01:42:25.70
So warrior bars.

1850
01:42:25.70 --> 01:42:26.70
Here's the thing.

1851
01:42:26.70 --> 01:42:30.70
I haven't been talking about the warrior bars, but those warrior bars are like key.

1852
01:42:30.70 --> 01:42:34.70
They're, they're a, they're a good to have on the standby scenario.

1853
01:42:34.70 --> 01:42:35.70
Oh, yeah.

1854
01:42:35.70 --> 01:42:38.70
And even like, that's like a semi daily.

1855
01:42:38.70 --> 01:42:41.70
What is semi daily? Is that every other day semi daily?

1856
01:42:41.70 --> 01:42:44.70
It's not necessarily important.

1857
01:42:44.70 --> 01:42:45.70
Yeah.

1858
01:42:45.70 --> 01:42:46.70
Semi daily.

1859
01:42:46.70 --> 01:42:50.70
Well, my frequency with these warrior bars is protein impact.

1860
01:42:50.70 --> 01:42:52.70
Uh, food.

1861
01:42:52.70 --> 01:42:55.70
They're not like, like, you know, a power bar.

1862
01:42:55.70 --> 01:42:56.70
Yeah.

1863
01:42:56.70 --> 01:42:57.70
It's not like that.

1864
01:42:57.70 --> 01:42:59.70
It's like a protein meat.

1865
01:42:59.70 --> 01:43:01.70
Anyway, it's called a warrior bar.

1866
01:43:01.70 --> 01:43:03.70
Anyway, that's every other day.

1867
01:43:03.70 --> 01:43:06.70
I would say it's like, I don't even like these words snack.

1868
01:43:06.70 --> 01:43:08.70
Because it doesn't feel like a snack.

1869
01:43:08.70 --> 01:43:13.70
It's like a hybrid snack slash meal protein, ish.

1870
01:43:13.70 --> 01:43:16.70
Anyway, nonetheless, there's a lot of cool stuff on there.

1871
01:43:16.70 --> 01:43:17.70
Cattle bells on there.

1872
01:43:17.70 --> 01:43:21.70
Are you, are you, you say artistic kettle bells, even though they are artistic,

1873
01:43:21.70 --> 01:43:22.70
but I do.

1874
01:43:22.70 --> 01:43:27.70
I feel like it doesn't capture the glory of the kettle bells.

1875
01:43:27.70 --> 01:43:29.70
Nonetheless, primal bells.

1876
01:43:29.70 --> 01:43:31.70
Legend bells, where I get them.

1877
01:43:31.70 --> 01:43:33.70
What do they call the Star Wars bells?

1878
01:43:33.70 --> 01:43:35.70
They call them space bells.

1879
01:43:35.70 --> 01:43:37.70
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1880
01:43:37.70 --> 01:43:41.70
Uh, I don't think they have a name for the group yet, but yes.

1881
01:43:41.70 --> 01:43:43.70
I just got the Darth Vader one, didn't come in yet.

1882
01:43:43.70 --> 01:43:45.70
Oh, like a stormtrooper Darth Vader.

1883
01:43:45.70 --> 01:43:49.70
There's a Boba Fet one, which is dope.

1884
01:43:49.70 --> 01:43:51.70
But I'm gonna get all three.

1885
01:43:51.70 --> 01:43:52.70
I'll report back.

1886
01:43:52.70 --> 01:43:53.70
Unless, anyway, on it.

1887
01:43:53.70 --> 01:43:55.70
Doccomps, slash chocolate, this way, you can get this good stuff.

1888
01:43:55.70 --> 01:43:56.70
A lot of good stuff.

1889
01:43:56.70 --> 01:43:57.70
Got a bunch of books.

1890
01:43:57.70 --> 01:44:02.70
Uh, the book to order right now is where the warrior kid free.

1891
01:44:02.70 --> 01:44:04.70
Where there's a will.

1892
01:44:04.70 --> 01:44:09.70
That book comes out May 28th.

1893
01:44:09.70 --> 01:44:12.70
So we're talking, you a better orgret.

1894
01:44:12.70 --> 01:44:14.70
Now, because it's probably gonna sell out.

1895
01:44:14.70 --> 01:44:15.70
You don't have to print more.

1896
01:44:15.70 --> 01:44:17.70
Yeah, don't forget about the first two.

1897
01:44:17.70 --> 01:44:18.70
And then the first two.

1898
01:44:18.70 --> 01:44:24.70
Yep, we got Way the Warrior Kid from Wimpy to Warrior.

1899
01:44:24.70 --> 01:44:26.70
And then ABC Away.

1900
01:44:26.70 --> 01:44:28.70
And then you got Mark's mission.

1901
01:44:28.70 --> 01:44:30.70
And Mark's mission is your daughter's favorite?

1902
01:44:30.70 --> 01:44:31.70
Correct, yes.

1903
01:44:31.70 --> 01:44:33.70
She sleeps with it.

1904
01:44:33.70 --> 01:44:34.70
Hmm.

1905
01:44:34.70 --> 01:44:35.70
Strange.

1906
01:44:35.70 --> 01:44:36.70
Yeah.

1907
01:44:36.70 --> 01:44:37.70
Not a stuffed animal, by the way.

1908
01:44:37.70 --> 01:44:39.70
It's a book, it's a hard cover.

1909
01:44:39.70 --> 01:44:44.70
Book, not the most physically cozy, which is not supposed to physically go.

1910
01:44:44.70 --> 01:44:45.70
But, yes, sleeps with it.

1911
01:44:45.70 --> 01:44:47.70
Yeah, her favorite book straight up.

1912
01:44:47.70 --> 01:44:48.70
Yes.

1913
01:44:48.70 --> 01:44:49.70
That's awesome.

1914
01:44:49.70 --> 01:44:56.70
So that's where the warrior kid and Mark's mission teaching good things to children.

1915
01:44:56.70 --> 01:44:58.70
And they need it these days.

1916
01:44:58.70 --> 01:45:00.70
And also you got Mikey in the Dragons.

1917
01:45:00.70 --> 01:45:04.70
That one is for a little bit younger crowd.

1918
01:45:04.70 --> 01:45:10.70
And then on top of that, of course, we got the discipline to create them field manual for which is for everyone.

1919
01:45:10.70 --> 01:45:12.70
Teach it to how to get after it.

1920
01:45:12.70 --> 01:45:15.70
The audio is on iTunes and Google Play and Amazon Music.

1921
01:45:15.70 --> 01:45:19.70
And the next three-moner ship, dichotomy leadership, which I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin.

1922
01:45:19.70 --> 01:45:25.70
You can get these books to learn about leadership.

1923
01:45:25.70 --> 01:45:29.70
And you can also get these books and give them to the people that work for you.

1924
01:45:29.70 --> 01:45:32.70
And you can also learn the people that you work for.

1925
01:45:32.70 --> 01:45:35.70
So that you all become better leaders.

1926
01:45:35.70 --> 01:45:37.70
On top of that, we have Eshelon Front.

1927
01:45:37.70 --> 01:45:42.70
That's my leadership consultancy and what we do is we solve problems through leadership.

1928
01:45:42.70 --> 01:45:45.70
If you've got a company, if you've got a business, if you've got a team,

1929
01:45:45.70 --> 01:45:51.70
and you've got problems at that team, the problems are due to one thing and one thing only.

1930
01:45:51.70 --> 01:45:52.70
And that's leadership.

1931
01:45:52.70 --> 01:45:57.70
So if you want to get those problems fixed at your team, go to Eshelonfront.com.

1932

In fact, it might be on during this, oh no, we're listening to it right now.

1934
01:46:06.70 --> 01:46:12.70

We got Sydney, December 4th and 5th.

1936
01:46:15.70 --> 01:46:18.70
Extrememoner ship.com, if you want to come, they're all going to sell out.

1937
01:46:18.70 --> 01:46:21.70
So try and sign up early. Otherwise, you're going to miss it.

1938
01:46:21.70 --> 01:46:26.70
The one in Sydney, by the way, I think we, I think the place that we got down there,

1939
01:46:26.70 --> 01:46:29.70
I want to say it's less than 400 people.

1940
01:46:29.70 --> 01:46:33.70
So that place is going to sell out quick.

1941
01:46:33.70 --> 01:46:37.70
Not to mention, start first time going to Eshelonfront.com.

1942
01:46:37.70 --> 01:46:39.70
So it's going to get crazy quick.

1943
01:46:39.70 --> 01:46:41.70
So if you want to come, try and sign up early.

1944
01:46:41.70 --> 01:46:46.70
EF online, this is online training.

1945
01:46:46.70 --> 01:46:49.70
If you can't come to the master, if you can't come to the master or let's say,

1946
01:46:49.70 --> 01:46:55.70
and this is the reason we created it is because we work with companies that have 62,000 employees.

1947
01:46:55.70 --> 01:46:59.70
And they say, hey, Jocco, can you train all of your employees?

1948
01:46:59.70 --> 01:47:02.70
They're around the world. And I say, no, I can't.

1949
01:47:02.70 --> 01:47:05.70
No, I actually say, stand by.

1950
01:47:05.70 --> 01:47:07.70
Let me talk to you in a month.

1951
01:47:07.70 --> 01:47:09.70
And then it's, hey, we created it.

1952
01:47:09.70 --> 01:47:11.70
It didn't take a month. It took a lot longer than a month.

1953
01:47:11.70 --> 01:47:14.70
It took us about nine months to get it out.

1954
01:47:14.70 --> 01:47:16.70
But it's online interactive.

1955
01:47:16.70 --> 01:47:21.70
Leadership training, get your whole organization on the same page.

1956
01:47:21.70 --> 01:47:24.70
And if you're an individual and you want it, you can get it to your F online.com.

1957
01:47:24.70 --> 01:47:37.70
And then we've got EF over watch where we're taking special operations and combat aviation leaders off the battlefield and putting them into companies so that they can help those companies lead.

1958
01:47:37.70 --> 01:47:47.70
And a lot of times people think, what is some, what is some special forces guy going to know about manufacturing.

1959
01:47:47.70 --> 01:47:50.70
Trust me, you put them in there. It's not about manufacturing.

1960
01:47:50.70 --> 01:47:55.70
He'll learn about the manufacturing. But what he's going to know, what he knows how to do right now.

1961
01:47:55.70 --> 01:47:58.70
He knows how to lead. And he's going to turn that organization around.

1962
01:47:58.70 --> 01:48:05.70
So that's EF over watch.com, where we can get your leadership.

1963
01:48:05.70 --> 01:48:07.70
You also, we're on the end of it.

1964
01:48:07.70 --> 01:48:12.70
In turn, webs, which is also called the internet by the way.

1965
01:48:12.70 --> 01:48:14.70
I think you're any of that.

1966
01:48:14.70 --> 01:48:16.70
Nonetheless, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.

1967
01:48:16.70 --> 01:48:17.70
I met a culture.

1968
01:48:17.70 --> 01:48:22.70
I met a culture else, Joccaz that juggle willing.

1969
01:48:22.70 --> 01:48:35.70
And thanks to everyone out there that, even out there that has fought and does fight for our freedom.

1970
01:48:35.70 --> 01:48:45.70
Standing up against these evil regimes in the world and putting your life on the line to defend.

1971
01:48:45.70 --> 01:48:50.70
To defend our ideal, which is freedom.

1972
01:48:50.70 --> 01:49:00.70
And here at home, thanks to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and board of patrol, secret service.

1973
01:49:00.70 --> 01:49:07.70
And all the other first responders, thanks to you as well for keeping us safe.

1974
01:49:07.70 --> 01:49:12.70
Here at home, and everyone else out there.

1975
01:49:12.70 --> 01:49:17.70
Remember this code that we talked about.

1976
01:49:17.70 --> 01:49:20.70
Remember what it meant to people.

1977
01:49:20.70 --> 01:49:29.70
And remember the will that it instilled in those people, a will so strong that they face death without fear.

1978
01:49:29.70 --> 01:49:32.70
And then remember the will.

1979
01:49:32.70 --> 01:49:40.70
The will that overcame that code was the will of freedom.

1980
01:49:40.70 --> 01:49:47.70
The will that says, I will bow down to no man.

1981
01:49:47.70 --> 01:49:58.70
The will to stand up no matter what kind of evil death code there was that attack and tried to enslave the world.

1982
01:49:58.70 --> 01:50:08.70
That evil was overcome by the strength of freedom and the will to get up.

1983
01:50:08.70 --> 01:50:15.70
And no matter what, get after it.

1984
01:50:15.70 --> 01:50:41.70
And until next time, this is echo and jacco out.
