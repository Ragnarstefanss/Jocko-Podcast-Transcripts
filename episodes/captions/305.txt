[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 305 with echo Charles and me, Jockel William Good evening,
[00:00:06] echo.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:08] Also, joining us again tonight, Dave Burke, Good evening, Dave.
[00:00:12] Good evening.
[00:00:13] We are going to continue the review of the book, the psychology of military incompetence,
[00:00:20] which we started on podcast 303, continued 304, we're going to continue it more
[00:00:26] now. And we got through some examples in the last podcast of the wartime examples.
[00:00:34] We'll get through the rest of these examples tonight. And this is a big set up.
[00:00:41] This is an arduous set up for part two of the book. I don't know if we'll get into part
[00:00:48] two of the book tonight, which actually starts to dive into the psychology of military
[00:00:53] incompetence. But like I said before, those explorations continuously refer back to the examples
[00:01:02] from the beginning, part one of this book, which is what makes the book powerful because it's
[00:01:09] not just theory, it gives you examples that connects the theory to reality. So that's what
[00:01:16] we're doing. If you haven't ordered this book, order it. It's called on the psychology of
[00:01:21] military incompetence written by Dr. Dixon, who is a combat better himself. If you haven't
[00:01:27] listened to podcast 303 or 304 yet, and go back and listen to those first, we're going through
[00:01:32] these military examples. And we're starting, you can see I'm starting to tune in, starting to
[00:01:37] call out some of these psychological pathology that ends up with bad leadership. And with that,
[00:01:44] we're going to go into the book. This chapter is called between war. So we end, we end world war
[00:01:54] one, and this chapter is called between the wars, because what should be happening between the
[00:01:58] wars, what should we be doing? We should be assessing what we did wrong, assessing what we did right,
[00:02:03] seeing what improvements we could make, seeing what new technology we could bring to bear.
[00:02:08] And let's face it, you fight a war like World War One, and there should be an insane amount
[00:02:14] of lessons learned. Unfortunately, this quote starts off with this chapter starts off the quote
[00:02:22] from George Bernard Shaw, and he says, the British soldier can stand up to anything except the British
[00:02:27] war office. What a horrible statement that is. Going to the book, military stock is never
[00:02:36] lower than at the end of a costly war. With a million dead, society's appetite for aggression has
[00:02:43] been a swaged. People were weary of the war, and tired of soldiering for the military, the truth
[00:02:50] was rubbed in by swinging cuts in men and material. We're done. World War One's done, you
[00:02:58] only think about being over it. They're over it. From being the most important members of the
[00:03:04] community, they were now relegated to a very minor role. That's the military. This thinly
[00:03:09] veiled and gratitude at three effects upon the military, with the horse yet self-consoling cry,
[00:03:15] now he can get back to some real soldiering. They withdrew into cocoons of professional
[00:03:21] impotence. In that strange, you get done with the war's arrow, now he can get back to
[00:03:27] soldiering, which for them, what does that mean? In accordance with the principle of that more
[00:03:31] floored aspects of militarism or defenses against threat to self-esteem, there was a falling back
[00:03:38] upon the rights of the barracks square, renewed attention to spit and polish helped to
[00:03:43] expunge the last traces of the mud of flanders. At higher levels of military hierarchy,
[00:03:52] service thinking was now embodied in an extract from a paper on Imperial Defense Data June 22,
[00:03:58] 1926. The size of the forces of the Crown maintained by Great Britain is governed by various
[00:04:07] conditions, peculiar to each service, and is not arrived at by any calculations of the requirements
[00:04:13] of foreign policy nor is it possible that they should ever be so calculated. That's the most
[00:04:20] insane thing I've read in quite some time. Well, I guess since I read the last chapter of this book,
[00:04:24] hey, we're just going to, we're building our military, the size of our military is just based on
[00:04:32] kind of what they think it should be. How nothing to do with what's going on in foreign policy,
[00:04:37] no calculations. That's not what we're doing. In the period between the wars, the shape and the
[00:04:44] equipment, if not the size of the armed forces, were partly determined by a number of curious military
[00:04:50] attitudes, these center peculiar, particularly around three instruments of warfare, tanks, planes,
[00:04:56] and horses. Describing a tank attack, which he had witnessed in 1916, general surritched
[00:05:02] Gail tells how the British command tried to exploit it with cavalry. Apparently, they failed,
[00:05:06] as it was born out by the grim sight of riderless horses returning when they had come.
[00:05:11] Man, that's an eerie image, isn't it? Of this experience he writes, I was impressed by the
[00:05:20] potential of the tank as I was unimpressed by the employment of horse cavalry in modern warfare
[00:05:27] conditions, yet after all our experience in that war it took us further 20 years to mechanize our
[00:05:32] cavalry. The lesson was clear, but the lesson was as clear in 1916 as in 1936, and truth was not
[00:05:40] 1936, but 1941 before the British began to implement lessons of 1916. What happened between these
[00:05:53] wars shows the alarming extent to which reactionary elements can draw the wrong conclusion from
[00:05:59] what to most people would seem quite unambiguous facts. Rather than recognize the potential of
[00:06:05] the tank, they drew the conclusion that innovation and progress are inherently dangerous,
[00:06:08] and therefore to be assured, the symptom is not without precedent nor confined to the army,
[00:06:15] while on naval maneuvers in 1893, Admiral Triand, wished to about face two parallel columns of
[00:06:23] battleships. From his flagship, he ordered that the two columns should reverse course by turning
[00:06:29] inwards. Unfortunately, the combined turning radius of the ships was greater than the distance
[00:06:36] between them. With mathematical inevitability, HMS Victoria was rammed by HMS camper down and
[00:06:44] sank with great loss of life. Other officers had seen what was going to happen, but dared not question.
[00:06:54] The lesson from this disaster seemed fairly clear. Admiral should base their decisions upon
[00:06:59] information supplied by their staffs and junior officers should not be afraid of speaking up
[00:07:04] when their knowledge, for example, the turning circles of naval craft and their special abilities,
[00:07:11] for example, superior eyesight and greater capacity for mental arithmetic, led them to believe
[00:07:16] that a given order would end in calamity. The argument seems sound enough. Indeed, even the
[00:07:23] most junior charlady, which is a cleaning woman, at the Admiralty, had she pondered the facts
[00:07:31] could hardly have failed to draw the same conclusion. But this was not the conclusion reached
[00:07:35] by her lords and masters. For them, Triand's lapse just went to show that it never pays to
[00:07:42] try anything new. No, as the lesson learned. Don't do inward. Don't do. That's the lesson learned.
[00:07:49] Don't do inward turns in a column. To return to the tank, the successive chiefs of the
[00:07:58] Imperial General Staff between 1918 and 1939 with a support of other senior officers did not
[00:08:03] exert themselves to mechanize the army. Some were actively obstructionist.
[00:08:10] Against these reactionary elements stood a handful of progressive army officers and a few
[00:08:14] like-minded civilians, the progressives who would assimilate it incontrovertible evidence
[00:08:21] from the preceding war with Germany and were only two well aware of Hitler's preparations
[00:08:26] for the next made their views known through books, essays, lectures, and by word of mouth.
[00:08:32] These moves were countered by the military establishment in two ways. So you got this whole group of
[00:08:36] people that are saying, hey, bro and bros, we need to make tanks a lot of them. We need to mechanize
[00:08:44] our cavalry. Look what happened. And that's what they're doing. Books, word of mouth, lectures, essays.
[00:08:51] These moves were countered by the military establishment two ways. Firstly, they resisted the
[00:08:58] Semination of Progressive Literature. Hey, stifle that paper. Secondly, they did their best
[00:09:05] to curtail the careers of those who questioned their own obsolete ideas. That's like evil.
[00:09:14] This far as I can see. Guys got a good new idea, curtail their career. For example, when
[00:09:23] Fuller and early protagonist of mechanization won the RUSI gold medal for his essay on tanks
[00:09:30] and later produced a book on the same topic, he was castigated by successive chiefs of staff
[00:09:36] and remained unemployed in the rank of major general for three years and then was forceably retired
[00:09:42] in 1933. In the course of these events, CIS, CIGS, Lord Kevin, whose ideas according to
[00:09:54] Fuller were about 800 years out of date, oh pine that no officer should be allowed to write a book.
[00:10:04] It's like insane. You can't make this up. You can't make this up.
[00:10:07] If you're ever in a situation where your subordinates are coming up with ideas that you don't
[00:10:13] agree with and your reaction is to shut them down, question yourself.
[00:10:25] Not to be outdone, his successor Field Marshal Montgomery delivered himself of a
[00:10:30] diatribe against Fuller's books while admitting that he had never read them because it would
[00:10:34] make him so angry if he did. Equally on ambiguous was the treatment metadout to LaDelle Hart
[00:10:41] a man described by the press as quote the most important military thinker of the age of mechanization
[00:10:47] in any country. This is the guy that we covered on the podcast. I don't know how many episodes
[00:10:54] we did, but it's a lot of them. BH LaDelle Hart over the years LaDelle Hart produced a number of
[00:11:01] articles and books on mechanization on new infantry tactics and on the strategic and tactical use of
[00:11:07] armor. His efforts encountered extreme hostility and resistance from the British general staff.
[00:11:14] When he submitted his essay mechanization of the army for military competition, it was rejected in favor
[00:11:21] of an entry on quote limitations of the tank. The judges were a Field Marshal and a general and a
[00:11:29] Colonel. Unfortunately, LaDelle Hart's entry was not entirely lost to view. Why could that possibly
[00:11:36] be unfortunate? Well, it's because along with other products of his pen, it was enthusiastically
[00:11:41] studied by Hitler's Panzer General Guirdeen and became required reading of the German general staff.
[00:11:48] You can't make this up. You can't make this up.
[00:12:02] Like those of his fellow protagonists, LaDelle Hart's army career was prematurely cut short
[00:12:08] by the military establishment. The cases germane to the thesis of this book. Here is was a man
[00:12:14] who was cultured, fluent, lucid, highly intelligent and that rare combination, a soldier who was also a
[00:12:20] first class military historian, one whose advice on military matters was frequently sought by
[00:12:26] such civilian leaders as Hore, Bolisa and Winston Churchill who in due course became the military
[00:12:33] correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and subsequently the Times chosen by these papers and preference
[00:12:38] to a number of retired generals who applied for the same job. And Hore, Bolisa, by the way, was the
[00:12:44] Secretary of War, prominent figure. Here's a man whose views and writings were eagerly studied and
[00:12:52] acted upon by many foreign powers, including Germany, Russia, France and Israel, whose prophecies
[00:12:57] in the military sphere were born out time and time again and who lived to see his ideas on
[00:13:02] mechanization and tanks tactics used against us by Germany in 1940. But here was a man so deported
[00:13:11] by the British establishment, by the British military establishment that Lord Gortt, chief of the
[00:13:18] Imperial General Staff at the outbreak of the war felt moved to say during a lecture to 400 officers
[00:13:24] of the territorial army, quote kindly remember that LaDelle Hart does not occupy a room at the war
[00:13:31] office. So not only do these people that can kind of play the game, get advanced, people that
[00:13:43] have trouble playing the game, like LaDelle Hart get pushed out. Do I wish he could have played
[00:13:51] the game a little bit better? Absolutely. Do I wish he would have been a little bit more indirect?
[00:13:55] You know, in his book when he talks about if you become a prophet, you get crucified. He became
[00:13:59] a prophet, and he got crucified. It was the same Lord Gortt, the army's top man at the outbreak
[00:14:07] of the war, whom or the leadership described as a, quote, utterly brainless and unable to grasp
[00:14:13] the simplest problem. These are the people that are trying to get rid of LaDelle Hart.
[00:14:21] LaDelle Hart remarked if a soldier advocates, here's what here's exactly what happens. If a soldier
[00:14:26] advocates any new idea of real importance, he builds up such a wall of obstruction, compounded
[00:14:32] of resentment, suspicion, and inertia that the idea only succeeds at the sacrifice of himself,
[00:14:38] as the wall finally yields to the pressure of the new idea it falls and crushes him. That's what
[00:14:44] happened to him. Some military leaders, even in democracies, have become a depth at manipulating
[00:14:52] their civilian bosses, such as the case over the issue of war minister Horabolisha.
[00:14:57] It seems he was not appreciated by military establishment. Five reasons, relevant to our general
[00:15:03] theory of military incompetence may be advanced for this, for this antipethi.
[00:15:11] Firstly, he was probably brighter than some of the senior officers with whom he had to deal.
[00:15:16] Secondly, his ideas for the army were progressive. Third, he made no bones about using LaDelle
[00:15:21] Hart as his military adviser, Fourthly. He was with every justification, critical of generals who's
[00:15:27] job at was to prepare the British army and France against the German assault on the West in
[00:15:31] 1940, fifthly he was a Jew. It was a for a mixture of these reasons that the general staff persuaded
[00:15:39] Chamberlain to sack the man who had probably done more for the army and defense than any other
[00:15:44] single person during Hitler's rise to power. It's weird how generals, I mean it's not weird.
[00:15:55] It's so prevalent how generals become untouchables. How could you dare say anything about this
[00:16:04] general he served is and that's what's happening here. And look, just because someone served their
[00:16:10] country, just because someone served their country and did a good job as a platoon commander, as a
[00:16:16] company commander, as a battalion commander. It doesn't mean they're going to be awesome as a general.
[00:16:21] In fact, there's some some things might indicate that those are very different jobs.
[00:16:29] Especially when they did good as a company commander or a platoon commander during World War I
[00:16:34] wouldn't do a good job was not disobeying orders and doing what you were told to do and freaking
[00:16:40] scurrying to a position where you don't get killed. Right? Because what happened to the brave
[00:16:46] soldiers? Most of them got freaking killed. We've talked about this thinking tactically and thinking
[00:16:53] strategically are really, really different and it's actually really hard to evolve from a
[00:16:59] tactician to a strategist. And in the military there's kind of a very clear delineation. Your
[00:17:05] tactician is a junior officer and the middle officer is an operational guy with sits between them
[00:17:09] and the generals with the strategic thinkers. But that evolution is really hard. It's really hard.
[00:17:15] You've talked about Peter's principle. I think on the last podcast where you get promoted to your
[00:17:20] level of incompetence that barrier between tactical thinking and strategic thinking is hard overcome.
[00:17:25] Yeah. Well you run into it with companies as well where you get some dynamic person and a
[00:17:30] start up and they're the CEO of the company but there's only 48 employees and they can make things
[00:17:34] happen and they kind of impose it well and they can kind of win the market and talk to people
[00:17:38] in a good salesman and it's a good work out awesome. And then all of a sudden they got you know
[00:17:44] 500 employees and they've got a board and they've got regulatory environment that they don't know
[00:17:49] on a handle and they turn into a disaster. It doesn't always happen but what we fail to do is we don't
[00:17:54] really do a good job of training people and at least making them aware of the situation that they're
[00:17:59] facing. Yeah. The other thing I wrote down was you're talking about this is and I saw this as I got a
[00:18:05] little more senior in the officer ranks and kind of get a little more observation of that general
[00:18:09] officer tier or that flag officer tier for the Navy is what gets them there is a bunch of success. A bunch
[00:18:16] of success and with that success if you're not careful what that success can do and it's not just true
[00:18:24] in the military it's true everywhere is that success is this is equals validation. And if you
[00:18:29] kind of start to get to this validation like hey what I'm doing is working you know what I should do
[00:18:36] I should keep doing the same thing and that flies against what you just talked about which is
[00:18:42] the training and the evolution to think differently from what you did and one of the symbols
[00:18:48] things we see this is hey if I if I if I'm a really good at a front-line task go to that particular
[00:18:53] task I'm I'm going to get promoted and I'll be the former and if there's other team and why I'm the
[00:18:57] former is because I'm really good at the task but my job isn't to do that task anymore my job is
[00:19:01] to think strategically and lead this team and I have no skills and no training to do that because
[00:19:05] the criteria for getting promoted is being good at the task and that success and that validation
[00:19:11] sometimes not always sometimes leads them to a level that they're not capable of doing but the
[00:19:17] system doesn't allow you to give them any feedback because when you're a general officer I guess what
[00:19:25] I'm a general officer there's there's something that you said that requires a little bit more
[00:19:30] exploring and that is you said that when someone gets advanced to you know a general officer or a CEO
[00:19:39] in many cases it's based on their successes there's something else it's based on
[00:19:44] their lack of failures so you know Dave and I go on deployment Dave does four operations they all go
[00:19:54] okay he gets the job done jocco go they were on the same deployment your task you to command
[00:20:00] or on the task you commander my task unit does 170 operations 168 of them go really well
[00:20:07] and have a huge impact two of them are jacked up who gets promoted who gets promoted this is not
[00:20:14] like a theoretical question who gets promoted yeah I'm getting promoted Dave's getting promoted
[00:20:20] because I didn't make any headlines for this screw up I didn't cause all this equipment and
[00:20:24] God forbid somebody got hurt or killed like we're not we're not having conversation with Dave
[00:20:27] Dave no friction no resistance no problem for me no additional paperwork I don't have to
[00:20:33] send an investigation out for what happened so yeah and it's not even that extreme it's really
[00:20:38] not even that extreme like you're you're you're making it really obvious but it's like hey
[00:20:45] you know Dave did four operations they went well good job jocco did a hundred operations
[00:20:51] they had a vehicle roll over right they lost a radio and they had a guy get wounded
[00:20:59] the guy get wounded it's like people understand that but all you know the vehicle roll over
[00:21:03] what kind of what wasn't this it was this really necessary and all of a sudden it's like well you know
[00:21:08] Dave kind of keeps it known as clean he did a good job who's getting promoted Davis so
[00:21:15] that's disturbing the other thing is you took at these these generals who made it who's
[00:21:21] getting promoted the ones that freaking lived how did they live they said oh you know sir maybe
[00:21:27] I could go back to the rear and and help you with your strategic planning you know here's another
[00:21:32] cup of tea hi really like Dave you know he's I want to bring him back with me makes my ego feel good
[00:21:38] so you're a little brown noseer and then you end up getting living through World War One and now
[00:21:45] I put you under my wing and along you go yeah and I'm sticking around the army too after world
[00:21:50] for a while I can stomach that whole thing as opposed all the guys that came back and like
[00:21:54] don't ever call me again yeah I'm that don't don't ever call me again yeah and not to mention
[00:21:59] I come back and I'm like hey look I did my time come and go out be an entrepreneur make money and
[00:22:04] build a business you're like hey I'm gonna come I'm kind of scared to get out I'll be there go
[00:22:07] just stay in here go begin to paycheck three hats in a cot you know I get the uniform
[00:22:13] people's treat me with respect I'm good
[00:22:15] back to the book to understand the psychology of these reactionary elements in the military
[00:22:24] establishment of men who choose to make the army their career painstakingly work their way
[00:22:30] up the hierarchy to the highest positions but then behave in such a manner to ensure that if they
[00:22:34] are remembered and all will be only for their conservatism we needs must have recourse
[00:22:42] to ego psychology thus it seems in that in the present instance military leaders like devil
[00:22:51] Montgomery, millen iron side and gork displayed behavior symptomatic of extremely weak
[00:22:58] egos in this light their behavior typifies the neurotic paradox in which the individuals need to be
[00:23:05] loved breeds on the one hand an insatiable desire for admiration with avoidance of criticism and on the
[00:23:13] other hand and equally devouring urge for power and positions of dominance that's weird
[00:23:21] the paradox is that these needs inevitably result in behavior so unrealistic as to earn for the victim
[00:23:28] the very criticism which he has been striving so hard to avoid consider a few concrete examples of
[00:23:34] this syndrome for those who had disappeared of anyone ever learning anything from the events of the
[00:23:40] first world war 1933 bought brought a belated gleam of hope with the publication of the Kirk
[00:23:47] Committee report which was not uncritical of the high command it could hardly have been otherwise
[00:23:53] but there were those for whom preservation of personal reputations counted for more than the need to
[00:24:00] avoid the repetition of senseless slaughter to which their direction had given rise this is this is evil
[00:24:06] i'm going to say that word this is evil we have a report that comes out that explains what we did wrong
[00:24:13] and some people they wanted to preserve their own reputation instead of trying to save future
[00:24:17] lives from lessons learned one such was field marshal Montgomery whose immediate response to the report
[00:24:23] was to block its dissemination throughout the army while one can wander at a system which would
[00:24:31] make it possible for one man to operate such censorship the precise reason for his behaviors by
[00:24:36] no means obscure Montgomery as he then was happened to be the chief of staff in the fourth division
[00:24:44] during the battle of the song so he's getting ratted out in this report
[00:24:48] and he's like puts the sides the report that'd be like if we had the blue on blue in
[00:24:56] Ramadhi and I was like hmm hide that with stifle it
[00:25:03] our second example is rather more complex concerning as it does that major obstacle to military
[00:25:09] development the horse as a noble if uncomprehending factor in military incompetence this animal
[00:25:16] was much in evidence between the war this is very interesting if you know anything about horses
[00:25:22] upon reflection is hardly resupprising that the horse became the
[00:25:27] cina quanon of military life for a thousand years met had found it in it enormous advantages
[00:25:35] there was nothing better for transportation and load hauling horses raised morale and enhanced
[00:25:39] egos horses took the weight off the feet and enabled people to go to war sitting down when they lay
[00:25:42] down you could hide behind them when it was cold you could borrow their warmth and when
[00:25:46] they died you could eat them because of the traditionally rural origins of so many army officers
[00:25:50] military families horsemanship in the context of sports like hunting
[00:25:55] became one of the preferred preferred leisure activities in such sports as polo
[00:26:00] pig sticking in an early-aged jelesting not only act out symbolic aspects of real warfare
[00:26:05] but are also associated with a higher social class there's little wonder that they should find
[00:26:11] so much favor with those who choose the army as a career all in all is not surprising that the
[00:26:14] cavalry became the branch of the army with the highest status nor is it surprising
[00:26:18] that they should have become the most vehement in the denunciation of the tank which was seen as
[00:26:24] an intrusive junior rather than the air and air apparent so they had this long fascination with
[00:26:29] the horse they love the horse the people that road horses in the cavalry ended up with a bunch of
[00:26:35] you know prestigious positions and high ranking positions and they saw the tank not as like hey
[00:26:40] this is what's going to take over the horse it's trying to it's juniors of the horse it's not as good
[00:26:46] as the horse nor is it surprising that the desire of the war office to playkate the cavalry
[00:26:52] was stronger a lot than logic not only did they veto any expansion of the tank or but under the
[00:27:00] direction among Gummery ruled that the new tank brigade should never be reassembled and this in the
[00:27:07] mid-1930s with Hitler army to the teeth that's you can't you just you have to have it you have to
[00:27:16] be a kind of like a psychopath to do this it there's a level of insanity in there it's like how how
[00:27:21] do you look at a horse in a tank and look at him go well yeah you know it's thinking like
[00:27:27] the bolt action rifle or the automatic machine gun they fire that one I think we're actually talking
[00:27:32] uh sword versus automatic machine gun I'm just trying to force like you gotta go for you gotta go
[00:27:39] harder though yeah it's fair point it's just the the depths of crazier said look at that and
[00:27:43] and carry was talking about this after the last podcast K dog was talking about this was the culture
[00:27:50] of the of the the cavalry and you just said it in there was it a thousand years
[00:27:57] people only use an horses and combat like there's a culture inside there that's going to be kind
[00:28:04] of hard to break into the tank come on man and it's it votes kind of the same frustration that I
[00:28:14] articulate in the very first podcast about the machine no it was before them and when I talked
[00:28:18] about the machine gun of how how long does it take for me to watch a machine gun mode down some
[00:28:22] of my guys where I go time out stop stop I got this one wrong we need to come up with another plan
[00:28:30] as opposed to like no just keep sending them in and do that for four years for four years at the
[00:28:36] risk of literally I mean millions of people but but the horse and the tank and even like old pictures
[00:28:42] of the war the the crazy thing about war war one tank so like the previous era of tanks that they
[00:28:46] be leveraged them they're these giant massive things they're like almost like comedically too big yeah but
[00:28:52] you if you would have just put those two side by side like you said there's a level of
[00:28:57] psychopathia level of of of of of crazy you got to go no the horse yeah give me the horse
[00:29:04] he made the horse dude there was a little bit of maybe even a little bit more than a little
[00:29:10] um when when we started using night vision yeah we talked about that we had guys that were like
[00:29:19] we'd be wearing night vision on patrol and that's because you shouldn't wear night vision like
[00:29:22] what are you insane let's you see in the door yeah you get to fight an enemy that's blind to you yeah
[00:29:30] well I've said this and I mean in in aviation I got the fly stealth airplanes like very modern
[00:29:37] stealth airplanes and to this day despite the insane advantage the insane advantage there is
[00:29:45] still ongoing debate over so whether or not we should have non stealth this is not this is like
[00:29:52] in fighters there's reasons I've not said that cargo planes and attack planes like but in this world
[00:29:56] of like airplane fighting against another airplane or using airplanes to get into a contested space
[00:30:00] they're still an ongoing debate of hey we should just retrofit like really nice legacy airplanes
[00:30:05] with cool cool missiles and cool engines and stuff like that my airplane is invisible my airplane is
[00:30:13] invisible you will not see it it doesn't matter how fast you can go or how much gas you can carry
[00:30:20] or how cool your weapon is you're going to lose how much longer till pilots are not doing this job
[00:30:26] fighter pilots I think we are one generation away my opinion is that the next generation which
[00:30:32] what scary is like it's much sooner it's not like 40 years from now the next generation of airplanes
[00:30:36] are going to come out in the next 15 20 years and there's going to be no pilots no no I think this
[00:30:40] general like they're building this now they're designing and building it now so this yeah and so
[00:30:44] technology one of the drawbacks of airplanes like from conception to development and building it
[00:30:50] takes a long time so this plane has been on the drawing board for 10 years and this is what happens
[00:30:55] when you got the military industrial complex because we gave this to Elon Musk dude I got your
[00:31:00] fighter pilot electric and to his dismay he probably wants and things and understands that
[00:31:07] we should be a generation head but be that as a may even with that I think we've got one more
[00:31:12] airplane in us with a person inside that's my opinion and you know even with that it is met with
[00:31:20] so much resistance so much institutional resistance yeah that's which is crazy right because you take
[00:31:27] the pilot out of the plane and and the other thing is you can you don't have to fight a plane
[00:31:32] with a plane you can fight a plane with 19 unmanned drones that have that cost a fraction of the
[00:31:39] price and can maneuver and don't have to worry about the stupid human in there screwing things up
[00:31:45] and that's why that story of the naval officer going you should buy all these tanks
[00:31:50] because he's got no yes no personal vested interest in the tank he's not inside that whole thing
[00:31:54] he's not a cavalry guy writing horses he's like I'm over here in a boat I'm just telling you
[00:31:58] for my vantage point it's not even close by this thing buy him all right now because he's
[00:32:05] he's detached he's just like oh no I'm not this is not for my personal game I'm not going to be
[00:32:09] in that tank around that horse I'm just telling you from from over here it's not it's not even close just
[00:32:14] do this because he sees it from a perspective and that's what I think that's where that that is
[00:32:22] it the level of frustration of hearing this is really hardest because hey you're there
[00:32:28] I said both actor rifle and machine gun and like go harder to you're harder so you know
[00:32:33] which is like a sling shot and a heavy machine gun automatic heavy machine gun that's how big the
[00:32:38] gap is and the only way to not see the machine gun is to be so invested and so committed to your
[00:32:43] point of view that just like we said last time you will dismiss the truth because it doesn't
[00:32:48] align with your preconceived outcome that you've created in your head which is probably to some
[00:32:54] degree the definition of being a psychotic a psychopath by the way there weren't just anti-tank
[00:33:02] and this gets in the Dave Berk territory there are anti-aircrafts too here we go for once the
[00:33:07] for once the usual rival between the two older arms sank beneath their mutual dislike of the new
[00:33:13] upstart if anything the admiral's waxed more rather more negative about aeroplanes than they did
[00:33:19] than did the generals whose minds as we have seen were already discomforted by the issue of tanks
[00:33:24] as mechanization threatened horses so aircraft threatened battleships but unlike horses and military
[00:33:30] minds battleships were only the last succession of obstacles to progressive naval thinking before
[00:33:35] battleships had been wood and before that sale each were link wishing each were licorsement
[00:33:41] and transition had been bitterly resented heavily opposed and productive of such irrational thinking
[00:33:48] as tends to occur when dearly loved objects have been renounced. When this is I've been
[00:33:56] referencing this a lot when I talk to people. When there was talk of iron replacing wood in the
[00:34:01] construction of ship one admiral was heard to remark that the idea was preposterous since iron was
[00:34:06] heavier than water the ships would be bound to sink on this issue has been calculated that and this
[00:34:12] is fascinating of the 20 major technological developments which lie between the first marine engine
[00:34:20] and the Polaris submarine the admiral's admiral team machine has discouraged delayed obstruction
[00:34:27] obstructed or positively rejected 17 17 out of 20 the essential and necessary incorporation of these
[00:34:36] developments in the structure of modernization has been achieved by individual and sometimes
[00:34:42] undisciplined officers by political industrial and industrial pressures or and most frequently
[00:34:49] by their successful adoption in rival navies so if you think I'm going to figure out some kind of
[00:34:56] I'm going to figure out what that list is it's like iron to wood and then getting rid of sales
[00:35:01] for steam and then from steam to what you know diesel and then from and there was people resisted
[00:35:05] every single 17 out of 20 those advancements there was resistance in nuclear reactor on a boat
[00:35:11] imagine the world does think you've ever heard right when doing a submarine are you insane
[00:35:16] can't be done can't be done as for battleships whose future usefulness and indeed
[00:35:23] very existence was threatened by the advent of aircraft quote two most admels the the respective
[00:35:28] value of battleships and aircraft was not basically a technological issue but more in the nature
[00:35:34] of a spiritual issue don't they cherished the battlefield with a religious fervor as an article
[00:35:41] of belief defying all scientific examination the blindness of hard-headed sailors to realities
[00:35:46] that were obvious to a dispassionate observer is the only explicable through is only explicable
[00:35:51] through the through understanding the place that quote ships of the line filled their hearts
[00:35:58] a battleship had long been to an admiral what a cathedral is to a bishop and you can't walk away from that
[00:36:05] I don't know if there is an equivalent in the teams if there is let me know but
[00:36:11] that description is is is is beautiful because in aviation you literally fall in love with your
[00:36:20] airplane like it's a person like it's a human being and and the degree to which you cannot see the
[00:36:26] truth is I would say on part of the degree that you can't see the flaws in your own children
[00:36:33] hey hey jocco you got an ugly baby no I don't that baby is perfect from head to toe everything
[00:36:39] about this thing unique and perfect and special and I can't go and go hey man your kids got some
[00:36:43] flaws here because that is the degree to which pilots fall in love with the equipment matches what
[00:36:50] he described or like the cathedral that's not an exaggeration and you will see people make these
[00:36:56] decisions based on irrational physical attachment to a piece of equipment thank God I flew a
[00:37:03] bunch of different airplanes so I kind of like sort of fell out in love with my first girlfriend that
[00:37:07] first airplane but I still kind of look back finally go man I really love the airplane and to be told
[00:37:14] hey this thing that you have is flawed like deeply deeply flawed and generationally behind
[00:37:20] weren't supposed to be and the end rather than sort of an object or yeah you're right there's some
[00:37:24] things about this it aren't very good oftentimes you get just this hyper irrational emotional response
[00:37:30] like you're talking about like I'm not trying to be critical of your this is a machine right
[00:37:34] we're not right I love with the machine are we well it's pretty spot on yeah that's like when you
[00:37:39] come up with a plan and you fall in love with your own plan and I'm like hey Dave not quite sure
[00:37:42] about your plan and this thing we were talking about talking about speaking of emotional
[00:37:48] depot detachments it was such strong emotional attachment that led admirals to deceive
[00:37:53] their political masters you can it doesn't get need more horrible than this I guess it does but
[00:37:58] the practical issue is whether or not battleships could defend themselves against aircraft
[00:38:04] having formed the opinion that they could the Admiral the Admiralty decided to prove its point in 1936
[00:38:12] while aircraft production by the Axis Powers was getting into top gear the king was invited
[00:38:17] to a demonstration in which naval ships would attempt to shoot down a radio controlled queen bee
[00:38:22] target aircraft unfortunately the demonstration did not go well despite the fact that the
[00:38:28] plane was flimited to flying 80 miles an hour and flew up and down without jinking while the
[00:38:35] ships were given a running start on a parallel course thereby reducing the speed differential to
[00:38:41] something approaching 50 miles an hour not a hit was scored dismayed but resourceful the
[00:38:49] admiral's played their last card deliberately crashing the radio controlled plane into the sea
[00:38:54] thereby proving at considerable cost of the British taxpayer that planes are no match for the
[00:39:00] battleship when these are in the right hands that's like an act of trees that is an act that's an
[00:39:07] act of treason I hate imagining the actual scene where you're like the remote control guy
[00:39:16] and I'm over your shoulder and I do it yet no hey put that thing in the water and it was like
[00:39:20] seriously like putting the water you know like that event had to occur like in real time
[00:39:26] whether there's something like hey this isn't going the way we plan let sabotage our
[00:39:29] experiment to prove our point that we've already predetermined which is planes aren't as good as ships
[00:39:36] crash that crash that drone will like we're like I Roger that's right and you like
[00:39:39] whatever you do you put that thing in the water go see look what happened yeah so let's just
[00:39:43] like essentially on a big scale like what you always say you risk like some people will
[00:39:50] sabotage your plan because they want their plan to be they want to prove you know the
[00:39:55] buck or you know you guys roll player whatever or if you approach the guy in the wrong way
[00:40:00] he'll be like yeah I'll do your plan if you shove the plan down like I threw mm-hmm right and
[00:40:04] then they're like okay I'll carry out your plan and then they might intentionally sabotage it to
[00:40:08] prove to you that hey your plan sucks therefore we should have went with my plan yeah I
[00:40:12] parallel sort of but um this is actually just like like treasonous right to just straight up
[00:40:23] why because you want to protect your little fife dumb and you are putting the security of your
[00:40:30] nation in complete jeopardy because you're so arrogant and stuck in your old ways and in love
[00:40:38] with your piece of equipment that's like that's treason that's treason yeah and it's it's also
[00:40:48] gonna result in your your people dying because the test is actually designed to go hey let's see if
[00:40:56] we can learn some stuff here hey it turns out this airplane thing is a good thing we should it and
[00:41:00] rather than get to the outcome you you will sabotage the outcome to get what you want which is I want
[00:41:06] to show you my my battleship is still supreme and the result is you're killing your own people
[00:41:11] it is not gonna happen for five years or whatever the timing of that was but it's gonna happen
[00:41:15] and we're gonna kill hundreds of thousands of people as a result of that and that's the treason
[00:41:21] I'm trying to remember I had something to happen one time where I was testing some GPS
[00:41:28] full and and it was supposed to be waterproof they're like hey this board this GPS is waterproof
[00:41:34] you don't need to waterproof and I was like trust me how is it like any e4 and e5 and the
[00:41:40] sealed teams going over the beach all the time I was a freaking expert on what was waterproof and
[00:41:46] what wasn't and I looked at this thing and I was like you're saying this thing is waterproof
[00:41:50] like that's what you're saying and they're like yep and I said no but how do you how should I
[00:41:54] prepare it they're like you don't need to and I was like you want me to test this thing and they're like
[00:41:59] yeah it's waterproof and I said okay cool shit was not waterproof you know like not even close
[00:42:06] and brought gave them back they're flooded out crappy GPS but there was there was sort of like
[00:42:13] indications of like you know what did you do you know did you open it well and I was like
[00:42:19] not an open any of these things it's not waterproof but you can see that's the kind of test where
[00:42:23] someone goes hey put it in a plastic bag and then say it's waterproof you know you got some
[00:42:27] contractor that's going to sell all these GPS's to to naval special warfare not on my freaking
[00:42:33] watch you're not this shit is a joke well the quilt any potential concern just that scenario of
[00:42:39] like that word that pre-wold or two you know battleship airplane British thing where it was just like
[00:42:44] hey we're just going to sabotage and and just false about the results I never saw anything to
[00:42:48] that degree I saw some resistance for sure but I never saw anybody or ever hurt anybody hey
[00:42:54] falsify the report sabotage the plan so just so people realize like I in my experience and I
[00:43:01] had some interesting things happened in my career I never saw that I'm sure I don't think I have either
[00:43:08] yeah I'll have to I'll have to think on that one but I'd probably would have stood out so much yeah
[00:43:12] I mean somebody over my shoulder saying hey put that thing in a waterproof bag and call it good like
[00:43:17] what do you know I would have never done that thousand years yeah I love the image
[00:43:21] willing to put that Joan in the water sir what do you mean crash it immediately and tell everybody
[00:43:26] got shot down it looks like we crash some drones as a matter of fact we were in uh we're going through
[00:43:32] through urban combat training and task in the bruiser and we're supposed to be using these
[00:43:37] drones and everything hey I see it was in one of the lace a license was like a drone pilot
[00:43:45] and whatever he was doing like he's like all right I'm going you know we're flying it going to
[00:43:49] look at the target and he's he brings tries to bring it back and this thing came in it like
[00:43:54] why don't I'll fast those things go what would be a realistic speed for a drone 50 knots
[00:43:59] this thing comes in at 50 knots it just way lays into a tree and of course they're like you know how's
[00:44:07] that drone working out I'd be like that drone sucks and the advancement on drones between that time
[00:44:12] frame 2005 and now is like night and day but if I would have been setting up the report or whoever would have
[00:44:18] been something yeah these things are great no we'd be like this thing sucks this thing sucks make it
[00:44:23] better that's what they did so thankfully listen we also didn't like falsify stuff all right
[00:44:30] those that's that's that's now we're moving into the second world war the pre the pre the
[00:44:36] in between war period is over nothing learned nothing figured out no no one taking blame
[00:44:42] responsibility for anything second world war there's a quote in here from La Del Hart the German
[00:44:49] success in May 1940 could easily have been prevented but for the opportunities presented to them by
[00:44:55] the allied blunders blunders that were largely due to the prevalence of outer-date ideas
[00:45:03] after an appalling start in which the allies were out fought out maneuvered and outstripped
[00:45:07] in the quality of their military thinking and equipment the second world war produced a
[00:45:11] biggest transition in military competence since though days of Wellington it was born of necessity
[00:45:15] and maybe said to have dated from Dunkirk this jolt to 100 years of military
[00:45:22] monitoring and 20 years of blind complacency achieved 3 ends within a space of days it shattered
[00:45:28] many long-held dearly loved illusions about the nature of modern war it hasten the eclipse of the
[00:45:34] old the reactionary the untalented finally by rendering the armory temporary impotent Dunkirk put
[00:45:41] the most junior service in the center of the stage Dave Burke is excited now the first time
[00:45:48] the continued existence of the army and navy became totally dependent upon their protection
[00:45:54] by the RAF look at this smile on this guy over here as for the bad start this was a legacy of
[00:46:02] factors that touched on the previous chapters rigidity of thinking over confidence resulting from
[00:46:08] a pathetic belief and antiquated methods of warfare and refusal to accept that enemy intentions may
[00:46:14] confound the armchair profits the following examples from the liberal hearts history of
[00:46:21] second war illustrate these shortcomings on January 10, 1940 a German aircraft carrying the liais on
[00:46:27] officer of the second air fleet lost its way in crash landed in Belgium by an extraordinary chance
[00:46:33] the officer was in possession of the complete operational plan for Germany's attack on the west
[00:46:38] did you hear what I just said by extraordinary chance the officer was in possession of the
[00:46:44] complete operational plan for Germany's attack on the west he tried to burn the plan but failed
[00:46:50] to complete this task before he was captured in this way its contents became known to the allies
[00:46:55] Hitler's response was to devise a new plan which involved attacking France through the Rden's
[00:47:01] rather than through Belgium as originally intended this episode was damaging to the allies for
[00:47:07] two reasons first firstly in the belief that the captured plan was a deliberate deception they failed
[00:47:13] to modify their own plans secondly contrary to advice received years earlier they clung to the belief
[00:47:20] that the wooded area of the Rden's was impossible to tanks as a result the strongest allied
[00:47:25] force remained poised for attack through Belgium while the Germans suffered little resistance
[00:47:30] to their outflanking drive through the Rden's here's another one the French they'll possessing
[00:47:37] many tanks which were as good as if not better than those the Germans were steadfast and
[00:47:42] their belief that horse to cavalry could destroy German armor in the Rden's for this reason they
[00:47:48] refused to accept the suggestion that fel trees might be used to delay the German advance like
[00:47:53] the poles they were sadly disillusioned about the outcome of a conflict between horse and tanks
[00:47:58] that's the poles and the French both making the assessment that hey you got tanks but we got horses
[00:48:07] the British retreat from the Gazale line in 1942 which resulted in the loss of towbrook
[00:48:13] followed by a headlong flight back into Egypt was the second worst disaster of the war after
[00:48:20] Dunkirk tobrook cost Britain 35 thousand casualties and an enormous loss in ground and material
[00:48:28] why did it happen inadequate general ship the army commander major general Neil Richie a fine-looking man
[00:48:35] has been described by his contemporaries in ways strikingly resembling of elf and stone raglan and boulder
[00:48:44] here's what his contemporaries had to say about him Richie was all hey wire by then all for counter-attacking
[00:48:50] in this direction one day and another the next optimistic and not and trying not to believe we
[00:48:54] had taken a knock when I reported the state of the first armor division to him at a time when I was
[00:48:59] planning to use it for a counter attack he flew to see me and almost took the view that I was being
[00:49:03] subversive another one general richie had a great air of the sizeiveness it was really rather
[00:49:10] indecisive according to the same core commander he quote had a tendency to ask your advice
[00:49:17] and having received it acted in the opposite way here's another one richie is not sufficiently
[00:49:22] quick-witted or imaginative another one a fine robust looking man with charm and manner but no aura
[00:49:30] and finally confident and decisive in his speech but one did not always feel he was quite
[00:49:37] so confident and decisive in his mind that's another thing I talked about that I think of the first one
[00:49:40] there's act that you learn you learn to kind of raise your voice a little bit you learn to project
[00:49:47] you learn to fero your eyebrows a little bit and you say hey listen Burke I love doing that right
[00:49:52] because it's something that we experience so much in the military listen up Burke hey
[00:49:56] I don't need your input right now look we need to make a move Burke you know like that thing
[00:50:01] people learn that in the military you learn how to act like that and eventually you can learn
[00:50:06] not a high behind that see that all the time so and people get fooled by civilians get fooled
[00:50:14] like by that but like it's going out of style I mean that's what they're looking for they're
[00:50:18] looking for the type cast kernel the type cast general that first is brow sits up straight with a good
[00:50:25] posture and then speaks in a clear effective manner that people are going to listen to
[00:50:32] and the politicians love to take that guy and put him out there to put out the word you know
[00:50:37] well you know what I'm saying they did they take that guy that put him out there
[00:50:41] hey we know what we got willing willink willink you know like put on an act
[00:50:45] no one's gonna mess with willing but willing on this down put willing on the stand
[00:50:49] willing gets and he puts his uniform on freaking puts his shoulders back chest out and then
[00:50:56] says I'm going to tell you this one time here's how it is going to happen boom people aren't
[00:51:00] questioning that fast forward a little bit under the ineffectual leadership of this big
[00:51:08] kindly courteous on imagine if apparently complacent yet occasionally touchy general the army
[00:51:13] suffered a decline in organization discipline and drive if he came flabby instead of taught
[00:51:17] sluggish instead of agile once again that fatal amalgam of overconfidence and under
[00:51:23] estimation of the enemy produced a doling of military endeavor rommel himself in his diary
[00:51:30] ascribed success to the British pre-delection for frontal assaults brave but costly charges by
[00:51:38] small groups in which the attackers banged their heads time and time again against the whole down
[00:51:44] German panzers hold down yeah let's do a frontal assault against a tank yep and a whole that's
[00:51:54] yeah that's whole down the meaning meaning they've positioned themselves where the whole is you can't
[00:51:59] see the tank you can only see the turret that's whole down echo tross hold down defilei you
[00:52:05] park that thing in a little berm in a little ravine and you can't see it only thing you see is
[00:52:10] this like the gun yeah and guess when you see the turret you know about five seconds before it
[00:52:14] lights you up yeah just walking right up on that thing it's hard to picture that because you know
[00:52:22] you know the story of the hey the French gonna dig this hey you know what you should do a deeper
[00:52:28] longer wider trench and a force that's impossible by armor like that's the plan yeah
[00:52:33] hey what do we learn hey I got an idea hey remember the trench we didn't older one not good enough
[00:52:38] let's dig a deeper trench and they're 100% sure that the armor can't go through this forest so
[00:52:43] we're good and we all know that story so you're just waiting to hear this this be revealed
[00:52:48] which is the idea of hey the horses you know this this this this force is impossible by equipment
[00:52:56] so you don't you need some horses yeah you know what I had when I had some trees when I had been
[00:53:00] miligan on from from his book um by water beneath the walls one of the interesting things the
[00:53:06] like the marine's had issues at Tarra and their solution like hey we are tracks didn't make it through
[00:53:13] and some of our Marines didn't make it to the beach because they hit um you know hit the the
[00:53:18] reef 800 meters out marine solution was okay you guess what real simple we need more more Marines
[00:53:25] and more tracks we need you know 80 tracks to make it through and half them don't make it cool
[00:53:32] 160's the number yeah and the the the the navy was like how about we go and you know try and
[00:53:41] figure out where those reefs are hence you deities
[00:53:48] if you didn't listen that podcast I think it's 298 with Ben Milligan and get that book get that book
[00:53:56] that freaking book is outstanding by water beneath the waves talk about a
[00:54:00] going into depth and figuring out and understanding why things are the way they are it's an outstanding book
[00:54:08] from the standpoint of human behavior human feelings leadership and decision making the events of
[00:54:14] 1942 in North Africa exemplify in microcosm the major causes of military incompetence underneath his
[00:54:22] robust exterior richy like boulder before him an elephant stone before him lack to self confidence
[00:54:30] and seem more concerned with proving himself to himself than with prosecuting the war
[00:54:37] the presiding over interminable committee meetings through which the army was run the seeking of
[00:54:43] advice and then not taking it and the disingenuous way in which he managed to convince the commander
[00:54:50] and chief that he was protecting tobrook wall in reality leaving it to the mercy of the Germans
[00:54:55] are the actions of a man beset by inter doubts these doubts were skillfully but not perfectly
[00:55:02] concealed by his often inappropriate facade of monumental complacency
[00:55:08] now we go to sing a poor chapter 11 one can sum up by saying that those responsible for the
[00:55:24] conduct of the land campaign in Malaya committed every conceivable blunder major general woodburn
[00:55:30] curbsing a poor the chain of disaster in the nine weeks between early December 1941 and mid-February
[00:55:37] 1942 the impregnable force fortress of Singapore Europe's gateway to the east with its thriving
[00:55:44] city huge naval dockyard and strategic vital airfields fell lock stock and barrel into the hands
[00:55:49] of the Japanese the invasion of this island stronghold the complete defeat of the combined
[00:55:55] British and Australian garrison with its army navy and air force units was the ultimate
[00:55:59] unconditional surrender of the whole area was so rapid that even the Japanese were staggered indeed one
[00:56:06] almost might say non-plossed by the ease speed and enormity of their success
[00:56:15] in the long run the results of this disaster may be deemed incalculable
[00:56:20] the myth of European supremacy over ageatic peoples was exploded forever and the prestige of
[00:56:26] competence of the British military endeavor in the eyes of the world in general and American
[00:56:30] particular were damaged beyond repair in the short run Britain lost her last and strongest
[00:56:36] foothold in the far east and a polling set back for the global war effort we lost thousands of
[00:56:42] lives both military and civilian but worse perhaps than the loss of life the military debacle
[00:56:48] condemned thousands more to three and a half years in Japanese internment camps
[00:56:54] finally the economic loss ran into hundreds of millions of pounds we forfitted elaborate and
[00:57:00] expensive dock installations naval and other engineering facilities military stores fuel the major
[00:57:06] port for exporting urgently needed rubber and two new first class battleships
[00:57:12] most of these material assets fell virtually intact into the hands of the enemy
[00:57:17] thus in effect doubling their value the value of their loss to the allies like other cases we have
[00:57:27] discussed that of Singapore is essentially a human problem a product of human behavior human
[00:57:33] intellect human character in human error no explanation in terms of geography climate
[00:57:38] broad political or military considerations can possibly do justice to the facts
[00:57:42] at bottom and at the top we are confronted with issues that are primarily psychological
[00:57:48] and which only a reduction to psychological principles can possibly explain
[00:57:54] so this freaking disaster unfolds in Singapore a disaster and as you're going to see it's
[00:58:02] not about who was smart and it's not about like the military situation it's the freaking
[00:58:07] psycho pathology of the leaders let us state the problem in terms of a number of questions why
[00:58:15] was the impregnable fortress planned and serviced in such a way that while presenting apparently
[00:58:20] formidable defenses on its southern side its back and northern sure was no more of a resistance
[00:58:25] than would be invader than the back of Bournemouth why was there an almost total lack of coordination
[00:58:32] and cooperation between those who had been entrusted with the job of defending the island why
[00:58:36] was it clear that the Japanese could and would assault the island from its northern side was
[00:58:43] nothing done to erect defenses in their path why did the general officer commanding Singapore
[00:58:49] lieutenant general person of all ignore the urgent advice of his subordinate Brigadier Simpson
[00:58:55] and of his superior general wavel to implement these defenses why on the one hand was so
[00:59:01] little done to protect the civilian population against air raids and on the other so much done to
[00:59:06] prevent their knowing the true facts of the situation as these unfolded why did general
[00:59:11] personal persistent believing the Japanese would attack from the northeast when confronted with
[00:59:15] overwhelming evidence that their assault would come from the northwest why did the officer
[00:59:20] commanding the Australian forces on the island forbid his troops to escape while secretly plotting
[00:59:25] his own get away from the island finally and perhaps greatest of greatest interest how did the
[00:59:32] men who could perpetrate such colossal errors of judgment ever reach a position where this was possible
[00:59:39] it's quite the setup in 1925 there's a protracted and acrimonious argument between the army
[00:59:47] navy and air force chiefs as the housing report should be defended while the older services
[00:59:51] press for fortifications and heavy fixed guns for repelling attack from seward
[00:59:55] trenchered for the RAF advocated for a large force of aircraft to repelling attack before it could
[00:59:59] become come within range of the island need this to say the army in the navy won their case
[01:00:04] at the expense of more junior service heavy fixed armaments armaments became the order of the
[01:00:09] day this debate in which the RAF had conceded defeat had three unfortunate consequences
[01:00:14] firstly the island was left exposed and undefended on its northern side second we seen your army
[01:00:21] commanders from that time on stubbornly clung to the dog with that no Japanese would ever advance
[01:00:25] on Singapore down the Malay peninsula finally the bitter inner service quarrel which ensued resulted
[01:00:31] in an almost total lack of coordination between the three services for future reference
[01:00:42] let me say this
[01:00:42] day view have a platoon in europeal tune there's a two different let's call them clicks
[01:00:54] and they have two different ideas of what you should be focused on and how you should operate
[01:00:59] and what you do is you sort of negotiate a piece between these two clicks and you sort of
[01:01:05] compromise and you figure out hey like we'll do a little bit of this click and a little bit of that
[01:01:08] click and you kind of you kind of bring these forces to a compromise you get them working together
[01:01:15] you get them to like take these things that they could be arguing about you you give one here
[01:01:20] and give the other side one here and so you you end up with a team that although they're not
[01:01:24] perfectly in sync they're at least sort of working together
[01:01:30] my platoon I have two clicks and what I do is I get mad at them because they don't get along
[01:01:40] and then I agree with one of the clicks actually a little bit more and so I give them favoritism
[01:01:45] and now we end up with this you know head buddy who's got a better platoon right so
[01:01:52] if you think about this in a large strategic view and you look at a place called the United
[01:02:01] States of America right now and you look at how miraculously or strangely we've become
[01:02:09] super divisive about all kinds of things to the point where we are banging against each other's heads
[01:02:17] and we don't get along and we've got people that sit so far apart in their beliefs not only do they
[01:02:25] sit so far apart in their beliefs they can't find common ground on anything on anything
[01:02:33] and we've got known known actors in the world that make moves to increase the division
[01:02:44] between the sides of people that we have in America and the people in America don't even recognize
[01:02:51] that all of this fighting is making our platoon weak it's very interesting isn't it it's very
[01:03:02] interesting that we know that there are actors that are there are state actors that are
[01:03:09] creating divisiveness in our own country and yet instead of saying hey you know what actually
[01:03:15] we shouldn't argue about that stuff you know a day you got your opinion on that I got my opinion
[01:03:19] but you know there's a bunch of stuff we agree on let's focus on that okay you know what that
[01:03:23] makes sense we can go execute the mission now instead no you know what day if you don't agree with me on this
[01:03:28] we'll screw you I don't even want to work with you now we can't operate we can't get anything done
[01:03:33] so obvious yeah it's so obvious it's hard to look at too because not only you're going to disagree
[01:03:41] you think you're going to actively sabotage my effort hundred percent and and the hardest part
[01:03:48] about that is that the reality is we are on the same team those two those two platoons in your
[01:03:55] task unit they're on the same team they're very disturbing yeah I've been sure I've got to think
[01:04:04] of way to articulate that a little bit more clearly and in present it in a way that people can see it
[01:04:11] but it's very difficult because when you present it if I present it to vupiltoon and say hey guys
[01:04:16] I think it looks like we're we're actually we're actually not helping here we're not moving this thing
[01:04:23] forward you know what one size is oh so you're trying to take their side are you yeah that's exactly
[01:04:28] what happens that's and that's the point I was thinking when you said that when you you know you you
[01:04:32] were sort of overt like I showed a little bias towards this one team which is all the other side
[01:04:38] needs to go oh I see what's up you're on oh yeah I see what you're doing you want to them yeah
[01:04:44] I see what you're getting at so I've got to think of a way to articulate this properly in
[01:04:48] people because right now but we don't understand it as Americans we are in this sort of trap
[01:04:55] where there's a total lack of coordination between the different sides yeah our government can't even
[01:05:00] get anything done they're they're they're they're losers they're just not not making any progress
[01:05:09] and all the doing is fighting with each other and not realizing that while we're fighting each other
[01:05:13] number one there's other state actors that are that are feeding this fight and while they're
[01:05:21] while they're feeding our fighting we're having these invites guess what these other state actors are doing
[01:05:26] growing their economy unifying their people growing their military strength
[01:05:34] growing the will of their people and we are being divided I'll think of a way to try and
[01:05:47] communicate this so people will hopefully start to understand it I haven't done a good job thus far
[01:05:56] meanwhile back on Singapore there's a total lack of coordination between the three services
[01:06:00] the the reason this is such a fitting thing is because you're going to see what happens in Singapore
[01:06:04] when you don't work together and when you're ego oh yeah by the way Dave I think I know everything
[01:06:11] and so therefore how can you possibly be right on anything at all yeah you certainly know you're right
[01:06:16] oh I definitely know I'm right the RAF began constructing airfield without consultation
[01:06:24] with the army who would have to defend them so there's a great move
[01:06:27] uh Japanese military machine was oh yeah this was the belief was look the Japanese they're
[01:06:34] primitive they're not going to be able to we shouldn't even take them seriously
[01:06:39] thus and now fast forward a little bit thus when the melee tribune published the news that
[01:06:45] Japanese transports had been cited off the southern tip of inno china the editor was immediately
[01:06:50] castigated by the commander and chief of the far east air chief marshal sir robber brook ponom
[01:06:57] popham who said I consider it most improper to print such a larmist views at a time like the
[01:07:03] present the position isn't half so serious as the tribune makes out this is such a great little section
[01:07:11] he says this form of complaint is not without interest firstly he did not deny the truth of the
[01:07:17] press release he hardly could since it originated in report by roiders which had been passed by
[01:07:23] the sensor and which undoubtedly was true secondly he managed to imply all in one breath that the
[01:07:31] situation was both not serious and yet likely to cause a alarm like why are you causing a alarm like
[01:07:37] this Dave and by the way there's nothing to be panicked about
[01:07:39] uh his words exemplified a tendency seen all too often to talk down to a civilian population as
[01:07:47] a group through some weakness of intellect or lack of moral fiber oh sorry who through some
[01:07:54] weakness of intellect or lack of moral fiber could not be trusted with information held by
[01:07:58] their elders and better's meaning the military's like you don't really know what's going on here
[01:08:03] you need to worry about that the guardians of Singapore were prime exemplars of this motivation
[01:08:08] after a long history of wrong thinking they could not afford to be found mistaken the more events
[01:08:13] prove them to be wrong the stronger their defenses became against admitting this to be the case
[01:08:20] and this is very important as Hitler's administration demonstrated in its darkest form
[01:08:26] man this is important suppression of the truth involves two procedures on the one hand
[01:08:32] censorship and on the other hand official communicates the high command and Singapore employed
[01:08:40] both measures take the order of the day released to the melee tribune a bear two months
[01:08:46] before Singapore capitulated it reads we are ready we have had plenty of warning and our
[01:08:54] preparations are made and tested we are confident our defenses are strong and our weapons efficient
[01:08:59] whatever our race we have one aim and one only it is to defend these shores to destroy such
[01:09:06] of our enemies as may set foot on our soil what of our enemy we have seen before us Japan
[01:09:12] drained for years by exhausting claims of our want non-slot of China let us all remember that
[01:09:18] we here in the far-reast form part of the great campaign in the world of truth and justice and freedom
[01:09:23] as the editor of the tribune said it was hard to believe that anybody could deliberately tell
[01:09:30] some any lies on Monday the 18th 1941 general headquarters issued its first war
[01:09:38] communicate it stated that the Japanese had failed in their attempt to land at Kotabaru
[01:09:44] this was followed shortly after by a second communicator which stated all surface craft are
[01:09:48] retiring at high speed and the few troops left on the beach are being heavily machine gun.
[01:09:54] In fact the communicator was essentially untrue and deliberately misleading within a space of a few
[01:09:58] hours from the time of the Japanese landing Kotabaru's firmly in enemy hands.
[01:10:05] There's a couple battleships as a desperate metal measure two battleships the Prince of Wales
[01:10:10] and the repulse were sent to Singapore to create an 11th hour presence they were under the command
[01:10:15] of admiral Sir Tom Phillips in the words of one who met him quote a real old sea dog
[01:10:22] bluff and tough unfortunately he lacks a fishing vision despite strong warnings that he could not
[01:10:31] expect adequate air cover he was soon off with his two ships in search of trouble.
[01:10:36] At first all went well as the ship steamed reassuringly up the east coast
[01:10:40] I'm here that there was weather so he thought he'd be okay his ships both the weather lifted
[01:10:47] his ships were spotted by Japanese air force torpedoed in sunk with a total loss of 8040 officers
[01:10:51] in men by all accounts filled so the boys of brave and conscientious officer but his
[01:10:55] braveness bordered on full-heartedness and his errors of judgment not only had a devastating effect
[01:11:00] on that much cherished commodity but the morale of the Singapore civilians also sealed the fate of
[01:11:06] their city so much for the navy and their chosen field the senior command of the RAF acquitted
[01:11:12] themselves the little better better. It has already been seen how air chief marshal broke
[01:11:18] pompom underestimated jab japan's air strength in comparison with his own ills assorted
[01:11:24] group of obsolete aircraft the same 63-year-old officer whose most notable characteristic was a
[01:11:30] tendency to fall asleep on the slightest pretext showed such disastrous hesitancy and indecision
[01:11:38] in his capacity is commander chief that as the official history was moved to state quote
[01:11:43] it is possible that he did not fully realize the importance of speed the need for quick decision
[01:11:48] was not apparently realized at headquarters malaya command and this is something I talked about earlier
[01:11:54] the first night raid they get a warning 30 minutes early that there's japanese inbound
[01:12:03] and they didn't do anything it seems the japanese had committed the unforgivable foe
[01:12:08] pava tacking at night unforgivable because it conflicted with the official dogma that the
[01:12:12] japanese were unable to fly their planes during the hours of darkness this idea cost Singapore 61 dead
[01:12:20] and 133 injured but the recklessness of the addonals and the did the ring of the air marshals would nothing
[01:12:27] as to the uncompromising of the generals it seemed that nothing could move them not even
[01:12:34] pleading of their fellow officers as noo barber says in his book sinister twilight quote
[01:12:41] when big brigadier general simpson and you remember this is like the good guy when brigadier general
[01:12:46] simpson the chief engineer went to see major general gordon Bennett commanding the eight
[01:12:50] australian division he founded impossible to make him realize that there was an urgent need for
[01:12:55] anti take defenses at first he did not want to discuss the matter at all since he noted after
[01:12:59] the meeting since it was horrified could not the australian general understand that there was nothing
[01:13:05] on the long road to prevent the enemy from reaching them apparently gordon Bennett could not
[01:13:11] for in his diary that night he wrote malay command sent brigadier simpson to discuss with me the
[01:13:17] creation of anti-tank obstacles for you saw the road personally have little time for these
[01:13:21] obstacles preferring to stop and destroy tanks with anti-tank weapons no wonder that the
[01:13:26] japanese never slowed down no wonder that time after time troops were annihilated by skillful
[01:13:31] japanese enveloping tactics on the british side wrong decisions were made communications
[01:13:36] broke down whole pockets of troops were caught off first japanese tanks appeared and came as a great
[01:13:42] surprise to the british who had not won single tank in malaya in a jungle country where the
[01:13:48] british had insisted that tanks could never operate the japanese tanks moved easily between
[01:13:53] spacious rows of rubber tree and quote major general gordon Bennett was not to use the appropriate
[01:13:59] vernacular and isolated pocket of resistance nor did he hold the record of obscenancy in
[01:14:04] barber's words a tamps by brigadier simpson to move and add to the defenses had been
[01:14:09] blocked at every turn largely by general person who seemed to have had a fixation against such
[01:14:17] measures nothing had been done nothing was being done despite previous please a hazard of belonging
[01:14:23] to any rigidity any rigidly authoritarian hierarchical organization is that from time to time the individual
[01:14:31] out of dire necessity or from strong personal conviction feels compelled to apply pressures to those
[01:14:36] above him it is a hazard because the ethos of the organization whether it be a Victorian
[01:14:43] family and english boarding school or the british army demands that pressure always moves only
[01:14:48] in one way downwards rather than upwards to buck the system by prodding those above can have
[01:14:54] unpleasant consequences you're totally freaking rigid situation and simpson is trying
[01:15:04] simpson is trying i'm a fast for a little bit it seems that simpson was past taking no
[01:15:07] for an answer for he said to the general sir i must emphasize the urgency of doing everything to help
[01:15:12] our troops they're often only partially trained they're tired and disperse it they've been
[01:15:16] retreating for hundreds of miles and please remember sir the japanese are better trained better equipped
[01:15:21] and they're inspired by an unbroken run of victories and it has to be done now sir once the
[01:15:27] area comes under fire civilian labor will vanish he's wanting to get these just just get freaking
[01:15:34] obstacles set up the plea was forceful respectful and logical but amazingly the general remained
[01:15:41] unmoved simpson in his rising anger said look here general i've raised this question time after
[01:15:46] time you've always refused what more you've always refused to give me any reasons at least tell me one
[01:15:52] thing why on earth are you taking this stand who's like what what the hell aren't you want me
[01:15:57] build obstacles wrong with you why not at long last the general officer commanding muleia gave
[01:16:03] his answer quote i believe the defenses of the sword you want to throw up are bad for the morale
[01:16:08] of the troops and civilians and quote since it was quote frankly horrified and remember standing
[01:16:16] there in the room suddenly feeling quite cold and realizing that except for a miracle
[01:16:20] Singapore was as good as lost as you put on his sam brown since could not for beer to make one last
[01:16:27] remark quote sir it is going to be much worse from a while if the japanese start running all over
[01:16:32] the island you can't make it that is so hard to listen to and for whatever sense of
[01:16:43] validation in my head of as soon as he said it's bad from rallin for stallus you know what's
[01:16:47] worse from rall and of course you know i don't know he's gonna say but i understand that that's
[01:16:52] what this guy is seeing or thinking and you saying that doesn't make me feel any better because
[01:16:57] it's just i'm not just getting repetitive at this point it's just a you have to be crazy to not except
[01:17:06] to not accept the facts that don't align with the world v the created in your head yeah
[01:17:11] and i'm only reading chunks of the book it's even worse than it's worse than i'm making it sound
[01:17:17] and i have the distinct disadvantage of seeing how much of this how much of this is going to be
[01:17:22] a gone through and go wow there's chunk i mean big big chunks which i can only assume
[01:17:28] just as we enforce over and over again another example another example another example another
[01:17:33] example and this dude is a good writer and he's a good writer and you and i'm glad that in the
[01:17:38] very beginning you set this up this this isn't a researcher this isn't like a theorist or or a
[01:17:47] you know an academic he has all those categories this guy fought this guy fought in this
[01:17:52] board so he was a warrior he ever assumed it yes yes by his own incompetent but
[01:17:57] he was on admission by the time he was like he's humble yeah which is awesome so
[01:18:02] yeah this is this is rough and and i think what i'm still adding to this is just i think it's
[01:18:07] at a point of repetition of just it's really hard to accept that these are real stories from
[01:18:15] real people in real leadership positions leading up to what was just people getting slaughtered
[01:18:26] you know like you said he was a soldier but he's also a psychologist and so he gives the
[01:18:31] psychological assessments to so here's here's one of them in the case of personal and Gordon
[01:18:36] Bennett to erect defenses would have been to admit to themselves the danger in which they stood
[01:18:42] in other words their professional anxiety about civilian morale was really displaced anxiety
[01:18:48] about their own morale looking further into the story of Singapore want to struck by the
[01:18:54] compulsive element in this refusal of the military to defend itself such compulsive behavior is typical
[01:19:01] of many who present an authoritarian personality and are reared in an organization which traditionally
[01:19:08] deals with fear and danger by ritualistic means i.e. bullshit, chicken shit, drill and parades etc.
[01:19:18] or is what i think he referred to earlier is like the real business of soldier and we're going to
[01:19:24] get back to you know drill and ceremonies so there's there's a there's an admiral that comes along
[01:19:30] or so yeah who was it supreme commander of allied forces in the far east this guy archbilled
[01:19:38] wavel and he he shows up and it's kind of like what the hell's going on bro so then next thing
[01:19:46] it happens is a direct from Churchill giving detailed instructions on how to defend the north shore
[01:19:51] the measures listed were precisely those which had been advocated by Simpson but despite these pressures
[01:19:58] persevolts still did nothing when he eventually issued a plan it was already too late for the
[01:20:03] necessary civilian labor was no longer available just as Simpson is at it was going to be on the
[01:20:07] disposition of his forces' personal thinking seemed no less deranged rather than hold a force in
[01:20:13] reserve that could could be rushed quickly to wherever the Japanese eventually chose to land he
[01:20:19] decided to spread his troops thinly over a long front in other words he decided now because it
[01:20:26] would be good for morale just exactly what he had refused to do early because it would be bad from
[01:20:32] morale in this battle of Singapore and they put that in quotes order of the day,
[01:20:36] first of all made it made great play of phrases like the enemy within our gates loose talk and
[01:20:43] rumor mongering all calculated to alarm civilians and this from the man who had laid such stress
[01:20:50] on the importance of civilian morale of this period barbarites in all the catalog of ineffectual
[01:20:57] leadership nothing is quite so public puzzling as the virtual absence of any deterrent action
[01:21:05] during the last precious hours of daylight before the Japanese attacked it is hard to believe that a
[01:21:10] modern general could so easily ignore what was happening around him that's I've never heard quite
[01:21:19] as bold of the statement as in all the catalog of ineffectual leadership that's a bold one yeah that's
[01:21:26] a big catalog says for the allies it was a week of chaos and confusion unreleave by any
[01:21:37] vestiges of competent leadership or general ship thanks to the absence of defenses including a
[01:21:44] failure to use search lights which had been assembled to blind and make targets of the attackers
[01:21:49] as they paddled in a way across the johor straits the Japanese landed almost unmolested
[01:21:57] despite a devastating barrage from Japanese artillery British guns instead of pounding the
[01:22:03] enemy's point of embarkation remained mute awaiting orders that never came despite weeks of warning
[01:22:11] allied ground forces were speedily outflanked and circled caught off or routed in the event
[01:22:22] 138,78 British Indian and Australian soldiers either died or went into captivity
[01:22:31] this is the beginning of few fliss and applaud cast number 12, Alistair O'erhart the forgotten
[01:22:41] highlander this is this is where he starts his captivity I think he'd been in the army for like
[01:22:48] two or three months at this point 19 years old
[01:22:51] 138,01 event
[01:23:05] of all the instances of military incompetence considered in this book is the fall of Singapore which
[01:23:10] most clearly gives the lie to the so-called bloody full theory of military and aptitude
[01:23:15] personal was in fact highly intelligent and had shown himself in previous years to be a brilliant
[01:23:21] staff officer what he shared with other earlier military incompetence were pacivity
[01:23:29] the opposite of default aggressive by the way and courtesy rigidity and
[01:23:35] obsidency procrastination gentleness and dogmatism 138,2 battleships by the way
[01:23:52] insane
[01:23:57] the next chapter is about our name this is when we covered we covered say we covered
[01:24:09] part of Singapore obviously when we covered Alexander Erhart
[01:24:13] our then we covered podcast 94
[01:24:16] the book was called man at arm and rid my Jeffrey Powell who was there who fought there
[01:24:22] and I think you know when you read the reading this assessment
[01:24:31] really puts it really puts that book in the perspective it starts off with this
[01:24:36] couple quotes all the accumulated evidence confirms that like gallipoli this was a British
[01:24:42] disaster where naked courage lacked the bodyguard of competent planning competent intelligence
[01:24:47] competent technology yet wars object is victory not the Victoria Cross
[01:24:55] and it was shameful that by autumn of 1944 we could still be so amateur
[01:25:04] the object is victory not the Victoria Cross we don't that's the equivalent of the metal of
[01:25:09] honor in England here's a private soldiers comments it began to seem to me that the generals had
[01:25:17] got us into something they had no business doing
[01:25:23] if it achieved nothing else operation market garden Montgomery's plan to capture and hold
[01:25:29] the bridge head across the Rhine in northern Holland at least demolishes the myth that military
[01:25:34] incompetence stems from stupidity for sheer initiative quickness of mind fortitude and
[01:25:41] selfless heroism the conduct of those who actually fought the battle has never been surpassed
[01:25:48] by the same token the men who planned and administered the operation were probably as intellectually
[01:25:55] gifted well trained professionally competent dedicated and conscientious as any military planners
[01:26:01] have ever been and yet the unfolding of market garden revealed all the symptoms of high-level
[01:26:09] military incompetence that's like in how would you feel if someone said you know what Dave
[01:26:17] your intellectually gifted well trained professionally competent dedicated and conscientious
[01:26:22] but that's what we're looking for in our leaders and yet this thing is a disaster the failure of the
[01:26:33] operation resulted from a a linked together of the following factors
[01:26:45] one as a result of his neglect to open up the port of Antwerp by clearing the
[01:26:50] shell the shell the estuary Montgomery allowed the German 15th Army to escape north into Holland
[01:26:56] where it was available to defend the approaches to Archnum two the arrival at Arnhem of
[01:27:05] 30 chord depended upon the advancing across 64 miles of enemy health territory on a one tank front
[01:27:13] along elevated unprotected highways flanked by a soft and tank and sawed and tank proof landscape
[01:27:21] interspersed with waterways any delay a blown bridge an enemy ambush a block road and the
[01:27:29] entire column would be stopped any delay and the Germans would have more time to bring up reinforcements
[01:27:35] in the event it is hardly surprising that 30 chord never did reach Arnhem that they could not achieve
[01:27:43] it even in nine days what it had been scheduled to take 48 hours now i'm going to say i know i gave
[01:27:49] credit to your 12 year old daughter and i'm going to say 12 year old daughter might not be able to
[01:27:55] figure this one out look you look and you got to go 60 what is it 60 4 miles 67 miles 64 miles
[01:28:02] but pretty much any land corporal mhm ring court sees a channelized 64 mile road that's completely
[01:28:16] exposed to the enemy and doesn't like this plan yeah if i'm hearing it correctly what you're
[01:28:23] describing is a one essentially a one it's it you called it a single tank approach so one lane
[01:28:28] highway which on either side is impossible yeah due to you know canals and and and deterring whatever it is
[01:28:34] it's impossible you have a one lane highway and your entire formation is going to be single file
[01:28:38] this is going to work and he mentions we might get ambushed right or or we might get a blown bridge
[01:28:45] how about this a broken down tank how about how about we have a freaking crash
[01:28:51] oh yeah number three as might have been expected from what is known of English
[01:28:59] autumn's the mist if not the mellow fruitfulness of the of an English slate September
[01:29:03] delayed the departure of subsequent gliders and pair troopers for the reinforcement of the first
[01:29:07] armor division like we didn't think there might be fog in the morning wearing England market garden
[01:29:14] perhaps more than most military operations in the cessated good communication between the various
[01:29:19] units and commanders of the attacking force but here technology failed them
[01:29:25] though it was now 50 years since marconi its exceeding sending messages by wireless the radio sets
[01:29:30] carried by the invasion force proved useless unless within air shot of each other no one knew
[01:29:36] what anyone else was doing and look you can say technology failed them if i'm a freaking military
[01:29:42] planner and i'm's relying on the communications in 1944 that's what's going to make us successful
[01:29:53] you're an idiot we can barely rely on communications 10 years ago we can rely on them up a lot more now
[01:30:01] maybe okay not 10 years ago sorry uh 20 years ago 20 years ago
[01:30:05] your barely your barely like to the year 2000 your barely thing oh yeah we don't we will get
[01:30:13] comms we had backup comms all the time backup communication plans we had all the time
[01:30:19] and you know what we had them in romatti as well of course yeah so to think that your comms are
[01:30:23] going to be good to go in 1944 that's not technology fail that's a freaking lack of planning yeah
[01:30:30] a single point of failure probably the most critical thing you're able to do is talk yeah more
[01:30:37] than employ your weapons even more than moving your ability to talk is probably the most critical
[01:30:42] thing that you have to coordinate all these different assets all these different things going on
[01:30:48] i can't say can't bury and we had i remember when i was in romatti because as an angle go marine
[01:30:54] comms was my was really the number one thing you was secondary to the utilization of the aircraft
[01:30:59] number one was comms we had this incredible comms we didn't every brief was hey let's
[01:31:03] hire let's create the prioritization of how we're going to communicate and it was based on where
[01:31:07] we were how far away we're going to be what assets were available if i have a home be cool i got
[01:31:11] a vehicle it's powered i got this high powered antenna i've got these cool powered radios
[01:31:15] and if i got to get out of that home be in start walking i don't have that thing and no i can't
[01:31:18] have a backup plan no and every single mission i went on me and my radio operator talked about
[01:31:23] if this doesn't work what are we going to do and guess what stuff eat the nicest best
[01:31:29] high step tech's it didn't work routinely yep and by the way what are you doing then you're getting
[01:31:34] out your signal panel right we're marking our position to put a big orange panel
[01:31:44] number five since the airborne assault was to take place in daylight and because it was vital
[01:31:49] that thirty core should complete their journey within 48 hours 64 miles and 48 hours on the
[01:31:55] single track the whole enterprise depended upon the absence of strong German forces both in rnm
[01:32:03] area and on the approach route from the south hence it came with something as a jolt
[01:32:08] when they received reports from the Dutch underground that two SS Panzer divisions which had
[01:32:13] mysteriously disappeared sometime previously had now reappeared along sa almost alongside the
[01:32:19] dropping zone this information passed on among gummery received support from the British
[01:32:24] aerial photography of German tanks in the arnm area meanwhile forward troops in the British
[01:32:30] second army reported a buildup of German forces along their intended line of advance
[01:32:38] hmm might want to reconsider this is the moment to reassess the risks involved but since these
[01:32:44] ugly facts did not accord with what they had planned they fell upon a succession of deaf airs
[01:32:51] taking the lead from Montgomery who described the report as ridiculous British second army headquarters
[01:33:00] were quick to discount it also when one of his intelligence officers showed him the aerial photographs
[01:33:05] of a German armor general browning at first British airborne headquarters reported I wouldn't
[01:33:11] trouble myself about the use of fire were you they are probably not serviceable at any rate
[01:33:15] if there is any stronger form of just straight like denial and idiocy than that right there
[01:33:25] you get shown the first you get intel reports and then you get shown photographs of the armor
[01:33:31] tanks the German tanks on the ground and you're like they're probably not serviceable you can't
[01:33:37] make this shit up you also know that there are two divisions there that are gone it's it's they didn't
[01:33:44] appear out of nowhere you know these divisions existed yeah that's the intelligence officer was
[01:33:54] then visited by the core medical officer who suggested he should take some leave because he was so
[01:33:59] obviously exhausted and at first allied army headquarters the chief intelligence officer
[01:34:07] British British Lieutenant Colonel decided there was no direct evidence that the
[01:34:10] Arnum area contained quote much more than the considerable flag defenses already known to exist
[01:34:16] as Ryan puts it quote all down the allied line of command the evaluation of intelligence on the
[01:34:22] panzers in Arnum area was magnificently bungled finally just in case there were any residual doubts
[01:34:31] the intelligence staff for the second army came up with the reassuring opinion that any German
[01:34:35] forces in the Arnum area were quote weak demoralized and likely to collapse if confronted with a
[01:34:43] large airborne attack that geek that's insane the freaking Nazis the Nazis are trying to defend
[01:34:56] their like they're fighting for their lives they're fighting for their country they know what happens
[01:35:07] if they lose they're some of the finest fighting forces in the world and yet we're just going
[01:35:13] to go ahead and catalog them as weak demoralized it likely to collapse and by the way randomly
[01:35:18] it just if they're confronted with a large airborne attack like that's the thing
[01:35:22] because hey when you're an airborne attack because that means you you you even have anti-tank weapons
[01:35:27] barely you've got no armor this is ridiculous
[01:35:35] market garden went ahead but not so quite as planned instead of encountering a few old men
[01:35:41] who collapsed a ran away first airborne division fell upon a horn it's nest of German armor
[01:35:46] far from being demoralized the enemy fought like tigers to defend the gateway of their homeland
[01:35:53] and far from sweeping across Holland to aid the hard pressed pair troops the tanks of the
[01:35:58] second armies 30 court were reduced to a crawl by the combination of unsuitable terrain and determined
[01:36:05] opposition
[01:36:07] and this is going to finish out the section the book defeat was absolute and terrible
[01:36:18] short on everything but courage the men of first airborne division held on
[01:36:24] until their numbers had been reduced from 10,000 and five to less than a quarter of that figure
[01:36:29] total allied losses and killed wounded and missing exceeded 17,000
[01:36:39] some 5,000 more than those who became casualties on day
[01:36:43] so there you have it defeat was absolute and terrible and that despite the fact that for the
[01:37:03] beginning of this section sheer a niffed initiative quickness of mine fortitude and self
[01:37:08] selfless heroism the conduct of those who actually fought the battle has never been surpassed
[01:37:13] and and this we want to talk about disturbing
[01:37:19] field marshal Montgomery described the mission as a 90% success
[01:37:25] that's that's how he presented it 90% success
[01:37:31] I think to be clear of anything in the aftermath of everything that has he considered it yeah
[01:37:36] he reported considered told people that this was a 90% success
[01:37:48] actually there's a little quote and there I got to read based on that
[01:37:54] there's this he so he says this is a 90% success and there's a Prince Bernard of the Netherlands
[01:38:05] said my country can never again afford the luxury of a Montgomery success yeah
[01:38:14] so that's what we've got it's insane it's weird how you and I are to loss for words over and over
[01:38:21] over again if you're listening to this and you've got some free time I think I mentioned it last
[01:38:30] time we're talking about some of the characters but band of brothers covers this and market garden from the
[01:38:35] American you know airborne troopers and and our now there's a cool
[01:38:42] replaying and retelling of this and what we saw in the combination of that but this is revealed there
[01:38:46] it's it's very well done but it does not it does not
[01:38:53] expose the depths of the why behind it it looks at it looks like it looks at it from a tactical point of
[01:38:59] view and it's it's very good to see it's really you should watch it it's not the band of brothers is awesome
[01:39:04] but this takes it and reveals it on a level that that for me the reason I can't I don't know what
[01:39:10] to say it's really hard to just it's this is this is 1944 yeah we aren't new we we we are not
[01:39:18] experienced yes indeed is behind us like this isn't figuring out how do we get our footing here
[01:39:26] things are not going though this isn't Singapore this isn't Pearl Harbor this isn't the invasion
[01:39:31] of Poland it isn't even the battle of Britain this is 1944 it's it's it's it's crazy you know that
[01:39:39] you can see I guess the British the British generals but they they have a different little character
[01:39:45] that they play you know when they get up and they need to convince people you can see like Monty right
[01:39:49] you know getting up but Jens is a rough fight but we've got 90% success right you know you can like
[01:39:56] that they're doing a different thing but it's the same it's a different accent but it's the same bullshit
[01:40:05] chest out for old eyebrows a little bit more a little bit more hotty from the brits from Montgummery
[01:40:14] but he's playing that same role and you gotta ask yourself why does this happen why why is this
[01:40:22] happening why are we going through these historical examples it's not from technology it's not
[01:40:29] from lack of fighting spirit it's not the terrain that's bad leadership and where does this bad
[01:40:38] leadership come from where is it rooted well it is rooted in the psychological the psychological
[01:40:46] minds of these leaders and there's plenty of great ones and we're not talking about them on this
[01:40:53] podcast we're talking about the psychopaths and we will dive into that on the next podcast
[01:41:03] until then echo Charles yes you know we're we're trying to not be psychopathic types of leaders
[01:41:10] we're trying to be better not we're trying to be better in all ways you know
[01:41:16] yeah gonna be recommendations for us how does your better we're trying not to have monumental
[01:41:21] complacency that's definitely we're trying not to do that I think those is the thing yeah
[01:41:28] so yeah let's not do that come about that okay well let's start with ourselves right you start
[01:41:33] with yourself I'm not gonna put your oxygen mask on before my own okay yeah otherwise I cannot
[01:41:39] breathe the point you know well I guess technically speaking if I was in charge of a group of
[01:41:47] soldiers and I was I had gout I was overweight I was unhealthy I was mentally unstable
[01:41:58] I don't think I'm gonna do a good job leading my soldiers it's gonna be very hard yeah
[01:42:01] gonna be difficult yeah so let's to your point let's make sure we got our shit together
[01:42:08] yes sir I agree and yeah here's some ways to do it look we're working out we're reading
[01:42:13] we're reading we're definitely reading we're listening oh yeah that's what I do
[01:42:19] I listen work out yeah I work out and I listen you know and I'm reading here in there either way
[01:42:27] when we work out we do things we got to put our bodies through little something
[01:42:32] so they can adapt to be ready for a big something hopefully hopefully hopefully
[01:42:36] okay on this path we're gonna take some beatings it's okay we got some supplementation okay
[01:42:41] let's talk about energy drinks first energy drinks the good energy drinks actually now I think
[01:42:48] nowadays when we talk about energy drinks where I haven't talked about the matter when's anymore
[01:42:51] well unless we indicate so we need to make sure that we tell people that when we talk about energy drinks
[01:42:57] we're talking about a certain type of energy drink that's good for you in all aspects that's what I'm saying
[01:43:02] exactly okay there are energy instead of all of them for you yes sir but now for now from now on
[01:43:07] we're gonna indicate that we're talking about that kind either way I got you okay jocco displing go
[01:43:14] energy drinks if you don't know that's that's a healthy energy drink got a little bit of caffeine in
[01:43:18] now 95 milligrams like a cup of coffee yes sir um a bunch of other healthy stuff
[01:43:24] it's an energy drink that is literally healthy for you's new tropics vitamins boom there you go
[01:43:29] yeah it's basically everything that you've come that you come to energy drinks for without the
[01:43:34] the backside what it called tab you got to pay with your health have you ever do you like the taste of
[01:43:39] any fast food well you know depends on like and yeah let me clear the path for you let me
[01:43:45] you know you bring me to a Wendy's which I used to work at I'm going ham in Wendy's right
[01:43:52] I just love like I would I really enjoy the taste of Wendy's probably two years ago
[01:43:57] let's think one of my kids went and got McDonald's you familiar with this place I
[01:44:02] I hear things yeah I had a couple fries and let's face it dude I mean these things are
[01:44:10] engineered by doctors and physicists and chemists to satisfy your taste buds and your dopamine's
[01:44:21] fire and right all the stuff is going on so now imagine this all that goodness imagine if you had
[01:44:27] all that goodness and there was zero downside right you know it's funny I had this mental
[01:44:33] excess because that's what you get with with with the go you get all that you get all that goodness
[01:44:39] you get all that goodness everything and now that for yeah exactly no now that you just go
[01:44:43] at just go ham you literally you're horrible you're not gonna see that I know I actually
[01:44:51] probably am well maybe I don't know either way I signed up for all that seems to be yeah the McDonald's
[01:44:58] thing I talked to my kids before they go on the Wendy's Burger King what you're go to well
[01:45:04] I don't have a go I haven't legitimately had fast food in years like I haven't okay like I had a few
[01:45:12] fries wait a second checkfully well during last things he's doing rest in season it's not
[01:45:18] like as greets let's face okay so we we talked about this actually briefly but I went when I was
[01:45:23] my way to Greg Jane's house and I had some McDonald's straight up and I went kind of hard to
[01:45:30] I didn't need anything all the it was week it was very very week oh that's the time you got like
[01:45:35] taunted by it was right on the side of the road right on the side literally like
[01:45:39] I don't know where you're to get the great chance as if you went through the McDonald's drive
[01:45:43] through it's it's what you convince yourself that is what it felt like yes oh you know there's
[01:45:48] that Wendy's right by victory I'm an infinite yeah oh yeah that's another one that's another but
[01:45:52] I felt for the trap of Wendy's one time I told you this I think I told you this where after training
[01:45:56] I was like I was a wood for Wendy's for like 48 hours and I was like oh man look there's the
[01:46:02] Wendy's on the way to training I'm like there's the Wendy's it's today's the day I can't be with
[01:46:06] this feeling yeah anymore I go train like kind of hard after training I go boom right into the
[01:46:12] Wendy's right out of the Wendy's drive through boom go eat it and I felt completely like shit after
[01:46:17] oh yeah completely after training Wendy's boy it like it jams you up oh yeah you shouldn't do that
[01:46:23] from then on Wendy's is easier to resist check this out imagine if you could go to Wendy's
[01:46:28] and you ate and it was delicious and made you feel great yeah yeah help you recover that's what this
[01:46:32] drink is yeah that's what this drink is oh it's a miracle it's a miracle it's a miracle that you
[01:46:40] can have all upside in no downside that's a miracle right am I wrong you were not am I wrong good you
[01:46:45] are correct actually all right well so there you go you want to try some of that yeah yes so now
[01:46:49] everyone's fired up I get it a similar vein mock yeah similar vein mock yeah because the same thing
[01:46:56] you're fired up to have something that tastes really good you're fired up for a milkshake yeah
[01:47:01] but you can you know you can if you go got bomb a milkshake bro like you feel like insulin coming

[01:55:57] paramedics and mt's dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret service and all first responders
[01:56:03] thank you for standing duty here on the home front and keeping us all safe and everyone out
[01:56:08] out there there's a common theme in this book that like i said it's really not in this book and that
[01:56:14] is a failure to detach and as we read these blunders and errors and catastrophes it's so easy to
[01:56:24] see these mistakes being made but they're not obvious to the people that are caught up in making
[01:56:32] these mistakes they can't see the tactical errors they can't see their emotions they can't see their
[01:56:40] ego and it wrecks them and it causes these disasters so don't allow that to happen to you
[01:56:51] the worst mistakes we make are the ones we don't see and we don't see them because we're too close
[01:56:57] so step back detach see what you're supposed to see and that will allow you to do what you are
[01:57:06] supposed to do and until next time zade an echo and jockel out
