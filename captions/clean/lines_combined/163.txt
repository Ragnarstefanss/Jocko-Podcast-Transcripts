00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.96 This is Jocopotcast number 163.
00:00:02.96 --> 00:00:05.88 The Coacherals and me, Jocco Whilling.
00:00:05.88 --> 00:00:06.88 Bitty-ding-accom.
00:00:06.88 --> 00:00:07.88 Good evening.
00:00:07.88 --> 00:00:13.28 I am bleeding out.
00:00:13.28 --> 00:00:16.56 I can feel my life,
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:21.76 and being away as blood seeps from my body into the Iraqi soil.
00:00:21.76 --> 00:00:26.76 A few brown weeds splashed crimson now,
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:33.16 or crushed around me as I lay sprawled on my back in the middle of this ambush.
00:00:33.16 --> 00:00:36.16 The weeds offer no concealment.
00:00:36.16 --> 00:00:41.52 I'm in the open, alone, and wounded.
00:00:41.52 --> 00:00:47.32 Sizzles of pain hit me in waves like pulses of electricity.
00:00:47.32 --> 00:00:51.80 A bullet has torn off my left arm.
00:00:51.80 --> 00:00:57.72 After I get hit, I reach over to grab my left hand.
00:00:57.72 --> 00:01:00.20 It isn't there.
00:01:00.20 --> 00:01:04.72 I hunt around feeling only the gear on the far left side of my body.
00:01:04.72 --> 00:01:07.56 No arm.
00:01:07.56 --> 00:01:09.76 I try to move the fingers on my left hand,
00:01:09.76 --> 00:01:14.96 but my mind sends signals to a station that doesn't exist.
00:01:14.96 --> 00:01:19.68 Now I can't feel anything, but pain.
00:01:19.68 --> 00:01:22.92 The bullets kick dirt in my face.
00:01:22.92 --> 00:01:28.32 Through my night vision goggles, I see green blooms of light strobing the darkness.
00:01:28.32 --> 00:01:32.20 Muscle flashes from automatic weapons.
00:01:32.20 --> 00:01:37.20 Ten meters away, and enemy machine gun opens fire again.
00:01:37.20 --> 00:01:43.60 It is a belt-fed Russian-made crew-served weapon, probably a PKM.
00:01:43.60 --> 00:01:48.28 They sound like giant zippers tearing open when the gunners go cyclic.
00:01:48.28 --> 00:01:53.88 Right now, the air around me erupts with sharp cracks.
00:01:53.88 --> 00:02:02.44 The miniature sonic booms of 7.62 millimeter bullet speeding past me at 2,500 feet per second.
00:02:02.44 --> 00:02:06.16 The terrorist gunner lowers his aim.
00:02:06.16 --> 00:02:09.56 A spurred of dust blows across my face again.
00:02:09.56 --> 00:02:16.04 Several bullets pass so close to my head that I feel shock waves as they go by.
00:02:16.04 --> 00:02:20.36 Through the left and AK-47 a sole rifle opens up, then another.
00:02:20.36 --> 00:02:23.32 I'm pinned in a crossfire without cover or concealment.
00:02:23.32 --> 00:02:32.36 A crippled sitting duck in a kill zone at least 100 meters long and 75 deep.
00:02:32.36 --> 00:02:36.000 With my right hand, I key the radio hands that I have mounted on my chest.
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.88 Troops and contact, troops and contact, I call to my command.
00:02:39.88 --> 00:02:44.76 We have three severely wounded, including me.
00:02:44.76 --> 00:02:50.20 I'm a static, greets my words.
00:02:50.20 --> 00:02:52.56 I can't duck.
00:02:52.56 --> 00:02:54.24 I can't crawl away.
00:02:54.24 --> 00:02:55.80 There's no place to hide.
00:02:55.80 --> 00:03:01.16 All I can do is ignore the incoming fire and stay focused.
00:03:01.16 --> 00:03:05.68 The PKM gunner, PKM gunner finds the range.
00:03:05.68 --> 00:03:09.88 Bullets crack around me.
00:03:09.88 --> 00:03:12.28 Dirt flies.
00:03:12.28 --> 00:03:17.92 The terrorist eases up on the trigger, but only for a second.
00:03:17.92 --> 00:03:22.12 I hear him unleash another burst.
00:03:22.12 --> 00:03:32.04 Then I hear nothing at all.
00:03:32.04 --> 00:03:42.04 Those right there are some excerpts from the opening chapter of a book called The Trident,
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:52.72 which is written by a retired seal officer by the name of Jason J. Redman.
00:03:52.72 --> 00:04:00.28 This book does an incredible job, not only of bringing the reader to the front lines
00:04:00.28 --> 00:04:08.24 in some pretty chaotic combat situations, but equally important, it brings the reader into
00:04:08.24 --> 00:04:15.48 the challenges of leadership and the challenges of life, especially the challenges of facing
00:04:15.48 --> 00:04:19.84 significant adversity.
00:04:19.84 --> 00:04:31.04 And J's book humbly displays those challenges wide open for all to see.
00:04:31.04 --> 00:04:40.08 And that humility from J is what makes this book so beneficial.
00:04:40.08 --> 00:04:51.44 He tells us plainly and bluntly of his personal triumphs and tragedies, his victories
00:04:51.44 --> 00:05:00.72 and his defeats and how he eventually found success and overcame by traveling.
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:05.76 And the path of humility.
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:13.48 And since I have the honor of actually knowing J, he has been kind enough to come by this
00:05:13.48 --> 00:05:20.32 evening and talk about his experiences with us.
00:05:20.32 --> 00:05:23.04 So with that, Mr. J Redman.
00:05:23.04 --> 00:05:25.04 Thanks for stopping by, brother.
00:05:25.04 --> 00:05:26.04 Jaco, brother, echo.
00:05:26.04 --> 00:05:27.04 Thank you.
00:05:27.04 --> 00:05:28.04 Thank you both.
00:05:28.04 --> 00:05:29.04 Have me on.
00:05:29.04 --> 00:05:31.80 Awesome to have you sitting here, man.
00:05:31.80 --> 00:05:34.28 Hey, man, honor to still be here.
00:05:34.28 --> 00:05:35.28 Bless.
00:05:35.28 --> 00:05:36.28 That's for sure.
00:05:36.28 --> 00:05:39.04 I tell so many people, I'm living on a second chance.
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:44.24 You and I got too many brothers who are not, I don't know why the big man decided to give
00:05:44.24 --> 00:05:48.96 me a chance, but I'm making the most of it outstanding.
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:54.12 So I want to try and start a little bit at the beginning, because people get a little bit
00:05:54.12 --> 00:05:58.08 familiar with where you are, everyone always wants to know where people are.
00:05:58.08 --> 00:05:59.56 People came from how they grew up.
00:05:59.56 --> 00:06:01.16 I'm going to the book right here.
00:06:01.16 --> 00:06:03.76 I came from a family with a rich tradition of service.
00:06:03.76 --> 00:06:05.88 So in retrospect, this made sense.
00:06:05.88 --> 00:06:10.20 My dad was a US Army airborne rigour at Fort Campbell during the Vietnam War.
00:06:10.20 --> 00:06:16.10 My paternal grandfather earned a distinguished fine cross while piloting a B-24 liberator
00:06:16.10 --> 00:06:19.40 bomber over the flat filled skies of Hitler's Europe.
00:06:19.40 --> 00:06:23.54 I also had a great uncle who flew fighter aircraft in the southwest Pacific during World
00:06:23.54 --> 00:06:24.54 War II.
00:06:24.54 --> 00:06:30.14 He made the ultimate sacrifice in battle against the Japanese.
00:06:30.14 --> 00:06:36.86 I dreamed of adding to that legacy, a life of combat, medals, and service.
00:06:36.86 --> 00:06:41.18 I was young and naive and had a long road to travel before I could truly understand what
00:06:41.18 --> 00:06:46.38 my grandfather and great uncle gave for the country.
00:06:46.38 --> 00:06:50.02 But that idealism became a very big part of me.
00:06:50.02 --> 00:06:53.50 I wanted to carry a rifle for a living.
00:06:53.50 --> 00:06:57.82 My dad watched this desire grow in me and decided to focus it.
00:06:57.82 --> 00:07:01.34 My freshman year in high school, he sat me down in our tiny living room and said, you
00:07:01.34 --> 00:07:05.58 know Jay, we had these guys come through airborne school.
00:07:05.58 --> 00:07:09.10 They were US Navy called Seals.
00:07:09.10 --> 00:07:11.46 They jumped out of airplanes, swam.
00:07:11.46 --> 00:07:15.66 They blew stuff up, given how you love the water.
00:07:15.66 --> 00:07:19.26 Maybe you ought to look into them.
00:07:19.26 --> 00:07:21.26 So your dad planted the seed, huh?
00:07:21.26 --> 00:07:23.26 It did.
00:07:23.26 --> 00:07:25.26 Young age.
00:07:25.26 --> 00:07:34.06 This was 90, probably 89, 88, 89.
00:07:34.06 --> 00:07:41.46 Back then, you really couldn't find hardly anything about the Seal teams.
00:07:41.46 --> 00:07:46.02 This was at a point in time where GI Joe was big.
00:07:46.02 --> 00:07:50.78 And I'm a 12, 13 year old kid into that.
00:07:50.78 --> 00:07:55.82 I was probably about 14 when my dad told me about the Seal teams.
00:07:55.82 --> 00:07:59.50 And started researching it, found almost nothing.
00:07:59.50 --> 00:08:06.54 By sheer happenstance, one of the guys in our church was a huge special operations buff.
00:08:06.54 --> 00:08:08.74 He was a guy that was unable to go on the military.
00:08:08.74 --> 00:08:12.10 He had had polio actually when he was a kid.
00:08:12.10 --> 00:08:16.58 He was just in batch-awaited by it and he had done tons of research.
00:08:16.58 --> 00:08:19.98 And he actually had collected some things about the Seal teams.
00:08:19.98 --> 00:08:23.54 He had an old soldier of fortune magazine.
00:08:23.54 --> 00:08:26.02 And you have those awesome.
00:08:26.02 --> 00:08:27.42 It's so different nowadays.
00:08:27.42 --> 00:08:29.02 No nowadays, you just Google it.
00:08:29.02 --> 00:08:30.02 Exactly.
00:08:30.02 --> 00:08:33.10 Back in the day, you had to be lucky enough to know some dude in church who happened to have
00:08:33.10 --> 00:08:36.18 a copy of the issue of soldier of fortune magazine.
00:08:36.18 --> 00:08:37.18 Is that still a thing?
00:08:37.18 --> 00:08:38.98 Is that what your fortune is still out there?
00:08:38.98 --> 00:08:40.70 Dude, it actually is.
00:08:40.70 --> 00:08:45.58 As a matter of fact, somehow in some weird twist of fate, I ended up being on the cover
00:08:45.58 --> 00:08:46.58 of soldier of fortune.
00:08:46.58 --> 00:08:48.18 I have to look, came out.
00:08:48.18 --> 00:08:49.86 And it was the most bizarre thing.
00:08:49.86 --> 00:08:52.18 Because now you're in the military and you look at this thing.
00:08:52.18 --> 00:08:53.98 You kind of laugh at soldier of fortune.
00:08:53.98 --> 00:09:00.06 It's a little bit of, you know, really focuses on probably the gung-ho aspect of soft
00:09:00.06 --> 00:09:02.06 as opposed to you came full circle.
00:09:02.06 --> 00:09:03.06 Yeah, full circle.
00:09:03.06 --> 00:09:04.06 That's what you're filled.
00:09:04.06 --> 00:09:05.06 Yeah.
00:09:05.06 --> 00:09:06.06 The soldier of fortune.
00:09:06.06 --> 00:09:07.66 It was pretty funny.
00:09:07.66 --> 00:09:14.50 But that magazine and that journey of coming to understand who these guys were that you
00:09:14.50 --> 00:09:16.98 really couldn't find much about them.
00:09:16.98 --> 00:09:19.02 It just drew me in even more.
00:09:19.02 --> 00:09:24.50 And the only thing, the core thread that I found over and over again was toughest training
00:09:24.50 --> 00:09:26.42 in the military.
00:09:26.42 --> 00:09:27.70 And you know, I was a young kid.
00:09:27.70 --> 00:09:33.42 I was a small kid and I just had this inner fire that if you told me I couldn't do
00:09:33.42 --> 00:09:37.06 something, it just drove me even more to want to do it.
00:09:37.06 --> 00:09:42.98 And everyone, you know, at that point in my life, I was probably four, four, eleven and about
00:09:42.98 --> 00:09:44.78 ninety five pounds.
00:09:44.78 --> 00:09:47.14 So when I told people I was going to become a seal.
00:09:47.14 --> 00:09:49.54 They laughed me out of the room.
00:09:49.54 --> 00:09:51.86 And that just fueled me even harder.
00:09:51.86 --> 00:09:54.66 And I set my sights on that dream.
00:09:54.66 --> 00:09:56.46 And that's where I was going.
00:09:56.46 --> 00:09:59.30 And you, some of the things you did, you started playing football.
00:09:59.30 --> 00:10:02.98 You started getting involved in sports to make sure you were physically fit and all that.
00:10:02.98 --> 00:10:08.70 So that was part of the driving factor and a good way to sort of prepare at least in a
00:10:08.70 --> 00:10:10.50 minimum way for buds.
00:10:10.50 --> 00:10:12.50 Yeah, absolutely.
00:10:12.50 --> 00:10:14.70 I mean, I wanted to build a mindset.
00:10:14.70 --> 00:10:15.70 I knew that fitness.
00:10:15.70 --> 00:10:17.02 I knew that being part of a team.
00:10:17.02 --> 00:10:19.10 I knew that pushing myself in different areas.
00:10:19.10 --> 00:10:21.42 So I started wrestling and I started playing football.
00:10:21.42 --> 00:10:23.50 And I was a small-ass guy on our team.
00:10:23.50 --> 00:10:25.70 But man, I just, I love football.
00:10:25.70 --> 00:10:26.98 I've always loved football.
00:10:26.98 --> 00:10:29.18 My dad had always told me, now you're too small.
00:10:29.18 --> 00:10:30.18 You're too small.
00:10:30.18 --> 00:10:31.34 You're going to get hurt.
00:10:31.34 --> 00:10:36.30 And so probably my 10th grade year, I said, I don't care what you're telling me.
00:10:36.30 --> 00:10:38.46 I'm going out for the team.
00:10:38.46 --> 00:10:42.14 And thankfully, we lived in a really small town.
00:10:42.14 --> 00:10:45.74 And I think they would take anyone and they looked at me and they said, well, we can
00:10:45.74 --> 00:10:48.50 at least use you as a tackling, don't we?
00:10:48.50 --> 00:10:50.74 And I said, Roger that, I'll do it, man.
00:10:50.74 --> 00:10:56.14 So, I will, you know, I'll hit somebody as hard as my 95 pounds camp.
00:10:56.14 --> 00:10:58.86 And got out there and just I loved the sport.
00:10:58.86 --> 00:11:02.90 And I know I was, you know, not a starter in any way, but I was out there every day.
00:11:02.90 --> 00:11:06.18 Just grinding and I'd trying to lay the hardest hits I could on people.
00:11:06.18 --> 00:11:08.42 And I played receiver and corner back.
00:11:08.42 --> 00:11:09.42 Nice.
00:11:09.42 --> 00:11:14.50 Now, I was also a little bit as I read through the book and it was kind of piecing
00:11:14.50 --> 00:11:16.38 together what you were like when you were a kid.
00:11:16.38 --> 00:11:17.70 I got to this point here.
00:11:17.70 --> 00:11:21.66 And she's kind of a little bit of a different direction going back to the book.
00:11:21.66 --> 00:11:24.98 At the same time, I fell in with the wrong crowd.
00:11:24.98 --> 00:11:28.38 I got a job my junior year and my work friends were drinkers.
00:11:28.38 --> 00:11:32.82 I started sneaking out of the house by sliding down the antenna pole outside my window.
00:11:32.82 --> 00:11:33.82 I'd meet with friends.
00:11:33.82 --> 00:11:38.02 We'd go drink at stagger home, drunk at odd hours the night scaling the side of the house
00:11:38.02 --> 00:11:39.66 with the help of that pole.
00:11:39.66 --> 00:11:43.14 My family tried to nudge me into course correction.
00:11:43.14 --> 00:11:46.66 But I had a chip on my shoulder and refused to listen, especially to my dad.
00:11:46.66 --> 00:11:47.98 Things got worse.
00:11:47.98 --> 00:11:53.34 My relationship with my father and step mom spiraled out of control into the ground.
00:11:53.34 --> 00:11:59.46 And instead of this war us all down as that slide continued.
00:11:59.46 --> 00:12:00.94 That happens.
00:12:00.94 --> 00:12:05.22 I mean, that straight up happens to kids, especially boys.
00:12:05.22 --> 00:12:07.66 And I think it has to do with I'm going to prove myself.
00:12:07.66 --> 00:12:08.66 I guess what I think.
00:12:08.66 --> 00:12:10.54 Hey, I'm going to prove myself.
00:12:10.54 --> 00:12:16.90 And one of the ways that you prove yourself is by proving that you're willing to sacrifice
00:12:16.90 --> 00:12:22.66 in a way and what better way when you're 16 years old to prove is like, oh, watch what
00:12:22.66 --> 00:12:23.66 I'll do.
00:12:23.66 --> 00:12:26.10 I'll drink all drink this whole bottle.
00:12:26.10 --> 00:12:29.98 And I think that leads to young males doing a lot of dumb stuff.
00:12:29.98 --> 00:12:32.02 And it sounds like you're right on board.
00:12:32.02 --> 00:12:33.02 Absolutely.
00:12:33.02 --> 00:12:38.10 You know, the thing that saved me though, this is where I got really lucky is I was smart
00:12:38.10 --> 00:12:47.02 enough and disciplined enough to understand that if I got myself in any kind of major trouble,
00:12:47.02 --> 00:12:49.30 I wouldn't be able to go on this yield to you.
00:12:49.30 --> 00:12:57.54 So like I said, we lived in a real small town in rural North Carolina and drugs were prevalent.
00:12:57.54 --> 00:13:00.18 And a lot of my friends were starting to get into that.
00:13:00.18 --> 00:13:03.98 And I just said, man, if I get, you know, that'll stop me from going in the Navy.
00:13:03.98 --> 00:13:07.90 So at least there was kind of a line I wasn't willing to cross.
00:13:07.90 --> 00:13:08.90 And I'm unfortunate.
00:13:08.90 --> 00:13:12.22 There were a couple of times we got ourselves in trouble where, you know, we were right
00:13:12.22 --> 00:13:14.54 on the edge of the law being involved.
00:13:14.54 --> 00:13:18.10 And, you know, we managed to dodge that bullet.
00:13:18.10 --> 00:13:20.46 But yeah, I wanted to get out there.
00:13:20.46 --> 00:13:21.30 I wanted to fit in.
00:13:21.30 --> 00:13:24.86 So I think it's a combination of both peer pressure as a young man, you know, I want
00:13:24.86 --> 00:13:26.22 to finish with this group.
00:13:26.22 --> 00:13:29.58 But I have my hopes and dreams so this direction I'm going.
00:13:29.58 --> 00:13:32.18 And I think that's where a lot of young men get off track.
00:13:32.18 --> 00:13:36.70 They want to fit in so much that they give up on their hopes and dreams and they get sucked
00:13:36.70 --> 00:13:38.42 down this path.
00:13:38.42 --> 00:13:44.46 For me, I had such a little laser focus on what I wanted to do that at least kept me in
00:13:44.46 --> 00:13:45.46 check.
00:13:45.46 --> 00:13:46.46 Yeah.
00:13:46.46 --> 00:13:51.98 I'm going to say this just to kind of add to that point from my perspective.
00:13:51.98 --> 00:13:57.26 If you, if you've got someone that's aspiring to do something, you know, higher, the people
00:13:57.26 --> 00:14:01.98 that don't have those aspirations are more than happy to try and crush that dream for
00:14:01.98 --> 00:14:04.46 and more than happy to pull them down.
00:14:04.46 --> 00:14:09.34 And so I've found that throughout life, if you have some high aspiration that you're
00:14:09.34 --> 00:14:12.46 trying to achieve or you see someone that's got high aspirations that they're trying
00:14:12.46 --> 00:14:15.26 to achieve, you can watch the people around them.
00:14:15.26 --> 00:14:19.62 If they're not good people, we'll try to rip those things and pull them down and pull them
00:14:19.62 --> 00:14:21.18 off that track.
00:14:21.18 --> 00:14:22.18 Scary.
00:14:22.18 --> 00:14:23.18 And it's unequivocally true.
00:14:23.18 --> 00:14:27.22 I mean, it's one of the tenants, you know, I now speak on something I call the Pentagon
00:14:27.22 --> 00:14:32.46 of peak performance and the fifth level is, or I'm sorry, the fourth level is social
00:14:32.46 --> 00:14:33.46 leadership.
00:14:33.46 --> 00:14:37.78 So how we lead ourselves, how we build our ring of friends and influencers.
00:14:37.78 --> 00:14:42.30 And you're unequivocally right, a great influencer and entrepreneur I've been recently
00:14:42.30 --> 00:14:43.82 working with.
00:14:43.82 --> 00:14:49.86 He gives an amazing analogy of he was up in Alaska on a vacation.
00:14:49.86 --> 00:14:54.70 He was walking the beach and there was a fisherman that was fishing with a net and catching
00:14:54.70 --> 00:14:56.70 crabs and he was putting the crabs into bucket.
00:14:56.70 --> 00:15:01.66 And you know, it's early morning and the guy's name, Pedro's Cooleyen.
00:15:01.66 --> 00:15:05.58 And Pedro's was watching this happen, you know, early in the morning, looked in the bucket.
00:15:05.58 --> 00:15:10.62 There was about 10 crabs and probably about, you know, five gallon bucket and probably about
00:15:10.62 --> 00:15:11.86 eight inches of water.
00:15:11.86 --> 00:15:16.42 And he kept watching as one crab would climb up and grab onto the edge of the bucket and
00:15:16.42 --> 00:15:18.38 try and pull itself out.
00:15:18.38 --> 00:15:21.94 And he like tells the fisherman, hey, hey man, I want to let you know, you're going to lose
00:15:21.94 --> 00:15:22.94 one of your crabs.
00:15:22.94 --> 00:15:25.06 And the fisherman doesn't even turn around and look at him.
00:15:25.06 --> 00:15:29.74 Keeps drawn his net and he goes, watch what happens.
00:15:29.74 --> 00:15:34.58 And Pedro's kind of steps back and he looks down into the bucket and he watches his all
00:15:34.58 --> 00:15:39.50 the other crabs grab onto that other crab and pull him back down.
00:15:39.50 --> 00:15:44.50 And he had this epiphany moment of the circles of influence he had in his life and he was
00:15:44.50 --> 00:15:47.26 like, oh my god, I have crabs in my life.
00:15:47.26 --> 00:15:52.70 He's like, I have people that I want to climb up and be better and they're pulling me down.
00:15:52.70 --> 00:15:54.02 And it is unequivocally true.
00:15:54.02 --> 00:15:56.50 I mean, it's something I brought up to the bud students yesterday.
00:15:56.50 --> 00:16:02.10 I said, if you want to be the best seal, you need to surround yourself with the guys who
00:16:02.10 --> 00:16:05.58 are driven, disciplined and they're pushing themselves to the edge.
00:16:05.58 --> 00:16:08.98 If you want to go to the next level, you need to surround yourself with the guys who are
00:16:08.98 --> 00:16:11.82 either already there or they are inspired to get there.
00:16:11.82 --> 00:16:16.66 Because if you're going to surround yourself with people who are content to just drink and
00:16:16.66 --> 00:16:20.66 not move forward at all, they're going to try and pull you into that circle.
00:16:20.66 --> 00:16:24.38 Because they're going to feel threatened that you don't want to do what they're doing.
00:16:24.38 --> 00:16:29.22 And they want you to assimilate with them, verse driving forward and being successful.
00:16:29.22 --> 00:16:30.22 It's unfortunate.
00:16:30.22 --> 00:16:31.82 It's just kind of a way of life.
00:16:31.82 --> 00:16:34.86 It's a horrible situation.
00:16:34.86 --> 00:16:38.34 So watch out for it because it's everywhere.
00:16:38.34 --> 00:16:42.98 So any you end up, so you graduate high school and go to recruiter and boom, right?
00:16:42.98 --> 00:16:46.98 I mean, any other particular things around the recruitment process?
00:16:46.98 --> 00:16:52.94 Yeah, the recruitment process was actually, I actually kind of got off track a little.
00:16:52.94 --> 00:16:54.82 So I went to the recruiting station.
00:16:54.82 --> 00:16:56.62 As soon as I decided, I want to be a seal.
00:16:56.62 --> 00:16:57.98 I went to the recruiting station.
00:16:57.98 --> 00:16:58.98 It's just 15 years old.
00:16:58.98 --> 00:17:00.98 It's 95 pound weekling.
00:17:00.98 --> 00:17:02.98 And I walk into the recruiting station.
00:17:02.98 --> 00:17:05.38 And I'm like, how I want to be a seal.
00:17:05.38 --> 00:17:12.62 And there was an old crusty. I mean, he was like an old school, probably 25 year e6.
00:17:12.62 --> 00:17:15.22 And just crusty is all get out.
00:17:15.22 --> 00:17:16.62 Boatons may.
00:17:16.62 --> 00:17:19.62 And that dude basically laughed me out of the office.
00:17:19.62 --> 00:17:24.06 It was like, get out of here, stop wasting our time.
00:17:24.06 --> 00:17:27.62 You couldn't even carry the paddle much less the boat.
00:17:27.62 --> 00:17:29.50 Get out of my office.
00:17:29.50 --> 00:17:31.42 And it didn't phase me in the least.
00:17:31.42 --> 00:17:34.94 I came back next week and was like, I want to be a seal.
00:17:34.94 --> 00:17:38.26 And this guy chased me out of the office.
00:17:38.26 --> 00:17:42.86 I came back about four or five times and he just continued to not even give me the time
00:17:42.86 --> 00:17:43.86 a day.
00:17:43.86 --> 00:17:47.22 So finally, I was kind of tired of that.
00:17:47.22 --> 00:17:50.38 Either way, things are real rough when the recruiter won't give a kid the time of
00:17:50.38 --> 00:17:51.38 day.
00:17:51.38 --> 00:17:53.38 Yeah, he's trying to make that quota.
00:17:53.38 --> 00:17:54.38 This is hard core.
00:17:54.38 --> 00:17:55.38 Oh, man.
00:17:55.38 --> 00:17:56.38 Yeah.
00:17:56.38 --> 00:17:57.98 Well, I mean, you think about a 25 year e6.
00:17:57.98 --> 00:17:58.98 Yeah, yeah.
00:17:58.98 --> 00:17:59.98 He was at a point.
00:17:59.98 --> 00:18:01.10 He didn't really care.
00:18:01.10 --> 00:18:07.70 So you know, when I got to the point, I came back again, probably about eight months later.
00:18:07.70 --> 00:18:09.94 And at this point, I had, you know, really started training.
00:18:09.94 --> 00:18:10.94 I was focused on it.
00:18:10.94 --> 00:18:13.22 I didn't let him deter me.
00:18:13.22 --> 00:18:16.54 And I came back and he had left just by sheer happenstance.
00:18:16.54 --> 00:18:17.54 He was gone.
00:18:17.54 --> 00:18:21.42 And there was a new recruiter in there, a guy by the name Henry Horn.
00:18:21.42 --> 00:18:24.86 Henry, if you're out there and you listen to this, I've never been able to track him down.
00:18:24.86 --> 00:18:25.86 And thank him.
00:18:25.86 --> 00:18:28.74 But Henry took me in and was like, yeah, man, absolutely.
00:18:28.74 --> 00:18:30.06 Sit down and add this video.
00:18:30.06 --> 00:18:31.06 You may remember this.
00:18:31.06 --> 00:18:32.94 It was a B-SOME one special.
00:18:32.94 --> 00:18:35.42 And it was the cheesyest.
00:18:35.42 --> 00:18:39.10 It was like 1980s video and it's best.
00:18:39.10 --> 00:18:41.74 And it was this high speed.
00:18:41.74 --> 00:18:46.14 You know, the shields come in on a helicopter and they get out and they take down this target
00:18:46.14 --> 00:18:47.74 and take out these terrorists.
00:18:47.74 --> 00:18:51.42 And you know, the tagline is B-SOME one special.
00:18:51.42 --> 00:18:53.70 And I just ate it up, man.
00:18:53.70 --> 00:18:58.50 And came back on a regular basis and Henry was fantastic.
00:18:58.50 --> 00:19:02.22 He told me these are the things you need to do, you know, as bad fitness, this is what's
00:19:02.22 --> 00:19:03.78 going to happen.
00:19:03.78 --> 00:19:07.38 So went to go sign up.
00:19:07.38 --> 00:19:11.06 Right as I was turning 17, I was going to do the delayed entry program and I went to
00:19:11.06 --> 00:19:18.18 go sign up and went, I got back up for a second.
00:19:18.18 --> 00:19:20.06 There was a glitch.
00:19:20.06 --> 00:19:22.50 I'm sorry, I got my facts backwards here.
00:19:22.50 --> 00:19:31.14 I actually because of the deal with the crusty E-6, I was in him being a block to me.
00:19:31.14 --> 00:19:33.90 I changed my mind as I decided to go army at first.
00:19:33.90 --> 00:19:35.54 Henry happened after this, I'm sorry.
00:19:35.54 --> 00:19:36.74 I got that backwards.
00:19:36.74 --> 00:19:37.74 Henry happened after this.
00:19:37.74 --> 00:19:40.50 And when I went back, I decided to join the army.
00:19:40.50 --> 00:19:42.90 I said, well, fine, my dad, you know, he was army.
00:19:42.90 --> 00:19:45.18 The Rangers, I'll go the Greenberry route.
00:19:45.18 --> 00:19:51.54 So I went to maps to do my intake screening for the army delayed entry program.
00:19:51.54 --> 00:19:56.58 And I failed the physical because when I was a kid, I'd ruptured my ear drum.
00:19:56.58 --> 00:19:58.86 And I had a lot of scar tissue on my ear drum.
00:19:58.86 --> 00:20:01.94 And the army said, oh, well, you're not going to be able to equalize.
00:20:01.94 --> 00:20:04.90 So they tried to convince me to still go in.
00:20:04.90 --> 00:20:07.54 They were like, oh, well, you don't have to be an airborne Ranger.
00:20:07.54 --> 00:20:08.70 You know, you can do this.
00:20:08.70 --> 00:20:09.70 So you can do that.
00:20:09.70 --> 00:20:10.70 You can drive trucks.
00:20:10.70 --> 00:20:13.26 And I was like, no, man, that's not what I want to do.
00:20:13.26 --> 00:20:14.26 So I left.
00:20:14.26 --> 00:20:16.26 And I didn't sign up.
00:20:16.26 --> 00:20:18.86 And probably a couple months went by.
00:20:18.86 --> 00:20:21.10 And that's when I came back.
00:20:21.10 --> 00:20:22.50 And the crusty E6 was gone.
00:20:22.50 --> 00:20:25.74 And Henry Horn was there and really helped pave that path.
00:20:25.74 --> 00:20:27.38 So kind of an interesting road.
00:20:27.38 --> 00:20:32.14 And I think the lesson is this is there's always going to be roadblocks that are going
00:20:32.14 --> 00:20:33.98 to deter you from your dreams.
00:20:33.98 --> 00:20:35.10 You know, don't let it stop you.
00:20:35.10 --> 00:20:37.10 Keep driving forward.
00:20:37.10 --> 00:20:41.30 Because by, you know, if I just listened to that guy right for the beginning, you know,
00:20:41.30 --> 00:20:43.62 I never would have been to see a shark.
00:20:43.62 --> 00:20:46.22 So you go in and you show up at Buds.
00:20:46.22 --> 00:20:48.98 Because I like this is a good going back to the book.
00:20:48.98 --> 00:20:50.26 Your intro to Buds.
00:20:50.26 --> 00:20:57.02 One night I was asked, order to escort a member of class 199 back to his room building in 602.
00:20:57.02 --> 00:20:58.26 He'd quit the program.
00:20:58.26 --> 00:21:03.18 And the neighbor required an escort for anyone who rang the bell during hell week.
00:21:03.18 --> 00:21:04.90 I went off to find him in the darkness.
00:21:04.90 --> 00:21:08.50 He was waiting for me a smaller guy like me wrapped in a blanket.
00:21:08.50 --> 00:21:09.90 He was shivering so badly.
00:21:09.90 --> 00:21:11.98 He seemed ready to fly apart.
00:21:11.98 --> 00:21:17.98 He put the blanket over his head like a hood, giving him a monastic look.
00:21:17.98 --> 00:21:20.98 He said little so we made our way to the barracks and silence.
00:21:20.98 --> 00:21:26.34 I walked alongside him fit fit to burst wanting to get any details on what I'd
00:21:26.34 --> 00:21:27.34 soon experienced.
00:21:27.34 --> 00:21:29.98 Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore.
00:21:29.98 --> 00:21:33.10 As he reached his door and opened it, I blurred it out.
00:21:33.10 --> 00:21:34.22 So come on, man.
00:21:34.22 --> 00:21:36.14 What was it like?
00:21:36.14 --> 00:21:38.66 He turned to me and looked me in the eyes.
00:21:38.66 --> 00:21:43.62 His room's nightlight cast an orange glow across his face.
00:21:43.62 --> 00:21:47.30 His skin was waxing and he looked hollowed out.
00:21:47.30 --> 00:21:50.90 At length he answered in a slow earnest tone.
00:21:50.90 --> 00:21:52.66 Dude, it was so cold.
00:21:52.66 --> 00:21:57.50 I would have poured gasoline all over myself and little match just so I could have been warm
00:21:57.50 --> 00:22:02.26 for a few seconds before I burned to death.
00:22:02.26 --> 00:22:05.78 He stepped back without another word and slammed his door.
00:22:05.78 --> 00:22:11.78 For the first time, I wondered what I'd gotten myself into.
00:22:11.78 --> 00:22:14.26 That's legit right there.
00:22:14.26 --> 00:22:16.02 He's wrote a buzz.
00:22:16.02 --> 00:22:21.86 So there's a, so not only did that blow my mind, you know, there's a funny little side
00:22:21.86 --> 00:22:22.86 story.
00:22:22.86 --> 00:22:24.50 We actually had to edit that.
00:22:24.50 --> 00:22:30.58 So the fire thing we actually created because what he actually, he told me that exact
00:22:30.58 --> 00:22:31.58 thing.
00:22:31.58 --> 00:22:37.34 The dialogue is the same, but what he told me was about his vulgar as all get out.
00:22:37.34 --> 00:22:40.54 It would have made the bull rated triple X.
00:22:40.54 --> 00:22:42.26 And it was so mind-blowing.
00:22:42.26 --> 00:22:45.66 Because I mean, you know, the fire thing we try to come up with what is as impactful
00:22:45.66 --> 00:22:46.82 as possible.
00:22:46.82 --> 00:22:47.82 But it does not convey.
00:22:47.82 --> 00:22:49.66 I'll let your imaginations run mild.
00:22:49.66 --> 00:22:55.30 But what he told me and he slammed the door in my face left me so stunned that I was like,
00:22:55.30 --> 00:22:57.22 what the hell did I get myself into?
00:22:57.22 --> 00:22:59.62 I mean, it was, but we could not put it in the bulldozer.
00:22:59.62 --> 00:23:03.22 It was so bad. I mean, I was like, my kids can never read that.
00:23:03.22 --> 00:23:05.62 Check.
00:23:05.62 --> 00:23:06.62 Check.
00:23:06.62 --> 00:23:08.98 So anyways, I mean, then you get the butt.
00:23:08.98 --> 00:23:13.94 You go through buds and buds is cool.
00:23:13.94 --> 00:23:17.14 And you write about buds a little bit in here, but you don't spend a bunch of time on it.
00:23:17.14 --> 00:23:21.86 Because as we know, buds is not a huge part of our careers and the seal teams.
00:23:21.86 --> 00:23:27.70 And I'm going to jump right right ahead to the book here.
00:23:27.70 --> 00:23:31.90 Seven years in three South American deployments, into my career as a seal, I found myself
00:23:31.90 --> 00:23:36.54 in Fort Knox, Kentucky, working as a basic warfare instructor with a small group of fellow
00:23:36.54 --> 00:23:37.54 operators.
00:23:37.54 --> 00:23:43.70 We worked 18 hour days, but being 20 something in single, once the gear was stowed, all we wanted
00:23:43.70 --> 00:23:47.14 to do was get out on the town and blow off some steam.
00:23:47.14 --> 00:23:49.30 Work hard, play hard.
00:23:49.30 --> 00:23:54.38 That was our pre-911 mantra.
00:23:54.38 --> 00:23:58.38 The 90s teams.
00:23:58.38 --> 00:24:00.82 Work hard, play hard.
00:24:00.82 --> 00:24:06.30 I always have to explain to people how cool it is being in the teams, being in E5 and the
00:24:06.30 --> 00:24:07.30 teams.
00:24:07.30 --> 00:24:09.54 You know, what were you in E5 or any sex at this point?
00:24:09.54 --> 00:24:11.18 I was in E5.
00:24:11.18 --> 00:24:13.30 E5 and the teams.
00:24:13.30 --> 00:24:17.06 And I was telling the story the other day, this when I got to seal team one, there was,
00:24:17.06 --> 00:24:21.82 I was a new guy and I was quietly walking through the locker room trying to keep my eyes
00:24:21.82 --> 00:24:25.50 inverted from looking at anyone and I heard this guy go.
00:24:25.50 --> 00:24:28.02 Oh, yes.
00:24:28.02 --> 00:24:29.90 And I was like, oh my God.
00:24:29.90 --> 00:24:36.26 And it was this barbaric yell from this human being who is, and then I looked at him.
00:24:36.26 --> 00:24:43.30 And he was this monster guy, probably six, seven, six, six, two hundred and eighty pounds
00:24:43.30 --> 00:24:46.14 of tattooed flesh.
00:24:46.14 --> 00:24:48.82 And someone's like, what happened?
00:24:48.82 --> 00:24:58.34 And he goes, I just made E5, master chief as far as I'm concerned.
00:24:58.34 --> 00:25:02.06 So, yeah, you know, you're getting to be in E5 in a seal-patoon.
00:25:02.06 --> 00:25:06.30 You know, you've got, if you're not looking for a lot of responsibility, you won't find
00:25:06.30 --> 00:25:07.30 it.
00:25:07.30 --> 00:25:09.94 But you won't, you know, you're a little bit above some of the crap work.
00:25:09.94 --> 00:25:12.50 So it's not a bad place to be.
00:25:12.50 --> 00:25:17.18 And that's where you were doing, doing deployment after deployment, three deployments to
00:25:17.18 --> 00:25:18.78 South America.
00:25:18.78 --> 00:25:21.62 And doing the training gig.
00:25:21.62 --> 00:25:22.62 Yeah.
00:25:22.62 --> 00:25:26.30 We went training cell at the team at this time, was it already consolidated?
00:25:26.30 --> 00:25:27.30 No.
00:25:27.30 --> 00:25:29.82 Each team had a Joan individual training, still.
00:25:29.82 --> 00:25:30.82 Yep.
00:25:30.82 --> 00:25:31.82 I did that too.
00:25:31.82 --> 00:25:36.90 And this is also the time during one of these trips where you met your future one.
00:25:36.90 --> 00:25:37.90 That's right.
00:25:37.90 --> 00:25:43.70 So, you know, the seal teams are in an interesting place because being an all-male unit,
00:25:43.70 --> 00:25:47.78 you know, the only time you have an opportunity to meet people, ladies, is typically in the
00:25:47.78 --> 00:25:49.22 bars.
00:25:49.22 --> 00:25:55.66 And because we did such a good job, you know, I tell people, the mindset of the early teams
00:25:55.66 --> 00:26:01.34 really was, you know, you know, more single captured that mindset in his book, The World
00:26:01.34 --> 00:26:02.34 Warrior.
00:26:02.34 --> 00:26:07.42 But it's interesting to see post-9-11 how guys are so laser focused on combat, you
00:26:07.42 --> 00:26:10.26 know, but for us, you know, literally we trained hard.
00:26:10.26 --> 00:26:12.62 And then, you know, you were actually looked down on.
00:26:12.62 --> 00:26:15.94 If you didn't go out and party and burn it down to like four in the morning and then
00:26:15.94 --> 00:26:19.90 get an hour of sleep and get up and start training in the next day, you know, which was just
00:26:19.90 --> 00:26:23.46 stupid, you know, you weren't operating it up to more efficiency.
00:26:23.46 --> 00:26:24.70 But that was just the way it was.
00:26:24.70 --> 00:26:25.70 That was life.
00:26:25.70 --> 00:26:28.46 And, uh, accepted it and drove through.
00:26:28.46 --> 00:26:30.42 So, yeah, I was fortunate enough one night.
00:26:30.42 --> 00:26:36.30 We went into a crazy, huge bar that somebody had scouted out and said, hey, man, this
00:26:36.30 --> 00:26:38.38 is a target rich environment.
00:26:38.38 --> 00:26:40.46 And, uh, the Phoenix Hill Tavern.
00:26:40.46 --> 00:26:46.98 And, uh, went in there and yeah, beautiful, blonde walked in and I was like, I need to
00:26:46.98 --> 00:26:47.98 get to know this.
00:26:47.98 --> 00:26:48.98 She hung me.
00:26:48.98 --> 00:26:52.46 So, you did all right, man.
00:26:52.46 --> 00:26:58.54 Along, along the course of this, um, you applied for the Seaman to Admin program, which
00:26:58.54 --> 00:26:59.82 is the same program I did.
00:26:59.82 --> 00:27:01.78 I think you were a couple years behind me.
00:27:01.78 --> 00:27:02.82 And we're going to the book.
00:27:02.82 --> 00:27:05.14 I had applied to the Seaman to Admin program.
00:27:05.14 --> 00:27:09.02 Something the Navy started to encourage top performing and listed to become officers.
00:27:09.02 --> 00:27:11.22 Only 50 candidates a year were accepted back then.
00:27:11.22 --> 00:27:12.74 So, the competition was fierce.
00:27:12.74 --> 00:27:17.66 I gained a slot in the Navy sent me to college just in time to miss the outbreak of
00:27:17.66 --> 00:27:19.46 the war.
00:27:19.46 --> 00:27:21.50 I watched the towers fall.
00:27:21.50 --> 00:27:25.82 I recognized the magnitude of the moment and left school in a days fully aware that
00:27:25.82 --> 00:27:30.62 our country was heading to war with three years of college ahead of me.
00:27:30.62 --> 00:27:34.14 I feared I'd miss my chance to be a part of it.
00:27:34.14 --> 00:27:40.78 A few days later, I drove back to my old seal team to see my former CEO and mentor,
00:27:40.78 --> 00:27:43.22 Commander Vince Peterson.
00:27:43.22 --> 00:27:47.10 He had stuck his neck out for me more than once and had been instrumental in getting
00:27:47.10 --> 00:27:50.34 me a shot a slot in the Seaman Admin program.
00:27:50.34 --> 00:27:54.18 I told him I wanted to drop out of school so I could get back to a platoon and help with
00:27:54.18 --> 00:27:55.82 the war effort.
00:27:55.82 --> 00:28:00.18 Commander Peterson sat listening quietly as he, as I explained my desire to come back.
00:28:00.18 --> 00:28:01.90 He was a legend in the seal teams.
00:28:01.90 --> 00:28:06.70 He had been a former Marine before joining the Navy and headed to seal training at the age
00:28:06.70 --> 00:28:08.78 of 36.
00:28:08.78 --> 00:28:12.26 He was highly respected both up and down the chain of command.
00:28:12.26 --> 00:28:16.78 In my leadership, fence analogy, most men fell on one side of the fence or the other,
00:28:16.78 --> 00:28:21.14 while there were those small few who had the unique ability to stand on top and move back
00:28:21.14 --> 00:28:22.14 and forth.
00:28:22.14 --> 00:28:25.18 For Vince Peterson, there was no fence.
00:28:25.18 --> 00:28:30.02 As I sat down with him and asked him to put me back in the platoon, he looked me dead
00:28:30.02 --> 00:28:34.26 and the eye and said, red, this will not be a short war.
00:28:34.26 --> 00:28:38.22 It's going to go on for years and we're going to need strong warriors and leaders for
00:28:38.22 --> 00:28:40.02 upcoming battles.
00:28:40.02 --> 00:28:42.26 You need to stay in school.
00:28:42.26 --> 00:28:47.26 Then come back and lead.
00:28:47.26 --> 00:28:50.26 Check.
00:28:50.26 --> 00:28:58.10 When I read that, of course, I thought about, guess what I was doing, when 9-11 happened.
00:28:58.10 --> 00:29:00.26 I was in college as well.
00:29:00.26 --> 00:29:03.82 On the same program, I was probably a year or two ahead of you.
00:29:03.82 --> 00:29:05.82 Guess what I did?
00:29:05.82 --> 00:29:06.82 Same thing.
00:29:06.82 --> 00:29:11.46 I called the Detailer who was a friend of mine who I had worked for.
00:29:11.46 --> 00:29:14.82 I said, hey, I don't care about college.
00:29:14.82 --> 00:29:16.14 I'll do online.
00:29:16.14 --> 00:29:17.54 I don't care about any of this.
00:29:17.54 --> 00:29:20.18 Send me back to a seal team right now.
00:29:20.18 --> 00:29:22.18 Please.
00:29:22.18 --> 00:29:24.14 You know who this individual is as well.
00:29:24.14 --> 00:29:28.14 And I know who this guy is and they told me the exact same thing.
00:29:28.14 --> 00:29:31.14 He said, this war is going to last a long time.
00:29:31.14 --> 00:29:32.14 Yeah.
00:29:32.14 --> 00:29:34.94 Of course, I didn't believe it.
00:29:34.94 --> 00:29:38.70 And this is what's interesting.
00:29:38.70 --> 00:29:43.66 I recently saw the guy that I called and I saw him in his wife who I know is wife and
00:29:43.66 --> 00:29:46.18 she's a great person.
00:29:46.18 --> 00:29:48.78 And I was telling her this, telling her this.
00:29:48.78 --> 00:29:49.78 And you know what she said?
00:29:49.78 --> 00:29:52.38 It was so awesome to hear.
00:29:52.38 --> 00:29:54.06 She goes, do you know how many calls he
00:29:54.06 --> 00:29:56.90 got that day?
00:29:56.90 --> 00:30:01.06 So there was zero unique about Jocco calling the
00:30:01.06 --> 00:30:05.38 the seal detail and saying, sir, get me back to a team right now.
00:30:05.38 --> 00:30:09.54 Every single guy that wasn't in a seal team in the teams or everyone that would be
00:30:09.54 --> 00:30:14.38 built in of any kind was calling the detail and saying, get me back to a team.
00:30:14.38 --> 00:30:15.78 Put me in coach.
00:30:15.78 --> 00:30:16.78 Yeah.
00:30:16.78 --> 00:30:17.78 And it goes to that mentality.
00:30:17.78 --> 00:30:20.78 You're talking about we were.
00:30:20.78 --> 00:30:26.22 You were just training and training and training and be like training for a game and
00:30:26.22 --> 00:30:28.22 training for the Super Bowl never getting play.
00:30:28.22 --> 00:30:30.22 Yeah.
00:30:30.22 --> 00:30:38.02 So you actually did a great job in college and you were an ROTC too, right?
00:30:38.02 --> 00:30:39.02 I was.
00:30:39.02 --> 00:30:40.02 Yeah.
00:30:40.02 --> 00:30:43.54 So I got the real scam deal where I just went to college and wasn't wearing a uniform.
00:30:43.54 --> 00:30:46.82 I was like far enough ahead of you that I got the deal.
00:30:46.82 --> 00:30:48.34 You were in the original program.
00:30:48.34 --> 00:30:50.74 So you got a commission and went to school as an officer.
00:30:50.74 --> 00:30:52.74 So you were getting paid off your page.
00:30:52.74 --> 00:30:53.74 I got to school.
00:30:53.74 --> 00:30:55.18 I got the most ridiculous deal.
00:30:55.18 --> 00:30:56.90 I apologize to the tax payers.
00:30:56.90 --> 00:30:57.90 Yeah.
00:30:57.90 --> 00:30:59.18 I think and the Navy quickly realized.
00:30:59.18 --> 00:31:00.18 Yeah.
00:31:00.18 --> 00:31:01.18 Okay.
00:31:01.18 --> 00:31:02.18 Yeah.
00:31:02.18 --> 00:31:03.18 We screwed this one up.
00:31:03.18 --> 00:31:04.18 I think it took them two iterations.
00:31:04.18 --> 00:31:05.18 Yeah.
00:31:05.18 --> 00:31:07.06 I was in because I think I was in the third iteration, third or fourth.
00:31:07.06 --> 00:31:08.82 But no.
00:31:08.82 --> 00:31:12.02 We actually were required to be a part of ROTC.
00:31:12.02 --> 00:31:17.82 So you know, every day we were up early and we and the Hampton Road General T.C.
00:31:17.82 --> 00:31:21.50 At that time, it was the largest ROTC consortium on the East Coast.
00:31:21.50 --> 00:31:23.82 So you had Hampton University.
00:31:23.82 --> 00:31:24.38 You had O.D.
00:31:24.38 --> 00:31:26.82 You old and mid-New University and you had Norfolk State.
00:31:26.82 --> 00:31:33.66 And they had at that time probably about I think we were at about 330 midshipmen and
00:31:33.66 --> 00:31:34.66 officer candidates.
00:31:34.66 --> 00:31:38.66 And we had a huge contingent of ex-inlisted.
00:31:38.66 --> 00:31:43.70 So there was actually, it was probably six or seven seals in the program there at that
00:31:43.70 --> 00:31:44.70 time.
00:31:44.70 --> 00:31:49.06 So it was good.
00:31:49.06 --> 00:31:50.54 We played all the games.
00:31:50.54 --> 00:31:53.86 Real quickly, I realized I said, okay, you know, they want it.
00:31:53.86 --> 00:31:54.86 You've got to step up.
00:31:54.86 --> 00:31:57.02 You know, they're going to put you into these different positions.
00:31:57.02 --> 00:32:01.02 And a lot of the guys had come there before me were kind of like, no, dude, we don't
00:32:01.02 --> 00:32:02.02 want to do anything.
00:32:02.02 --> 00:32:03.02 We don't want to be involved.
00:32:03.02 --> 00:32:05.66 We just want to, you know, a lot of times typical team guys.
00:32:05.66 --> 00:32:09.26 We want to create our own little circle of trust.
00:32:09.26 --> 00:32:11.26 And we don't want to let anybody else in the circle.
00:32:11.26 --> 00:32:13.22 And I was like, no, man.
00:32:13.22 --> 00:32:14.78 We had chains at mindset.
00:32:14.78 --> 00:32:18.38 There's young kids here that we could influence to become future frog men.
00:32:18.38 --> 00:32:23.58 I said, and because there was no, that all these communities at the school, they had,
00:32:23.58 --> 00:32:28.74 they had, you know, surface warfare community, they had the aviation club, they had the submariner
00:32:28.74 --> 00:32:29.74 club.
00:32:29.74 --> 00:32:32.58 But there was no special operations club.
00:32:32.58 --> 00:32:34.06 And there were young kids who were interested.
00:32:34.06 --> 00:32:37.30 And I said, what we need to create this, you know, we have the experience.
00:32:37.30 --> 00:32:38.62 We can help these kids.
00:32:38.62 --> 00:32:43.18 And then the other thing I said is I said, well, you know, I'm going to try and
00:32:43.18 --> 00:32:45.26 step up into leadership positions.
00:32:45.26 --> 00:32:47.42 And I think all the rest of us should do the same.
00:32:47.42 --> 00:32:49.54 And thankfully, you know, it worked.
00:32:49.54 --> 00:32:50.90 We all jumped on board.
00:32:50.90 --> 00:32:52.62 And, you know, I was fortunate.
00:32:52.62 --> 00:32:54.10 I did excel in school.
00:32:54.10 --> 00:33:00.90 And I ended up leaving the school as the student Italian commanding officer prior to being commissioned.
00:33:00.90 --> 00:33:02.22 Damn.
00:33:02.22 --> 00:33:07.82 I was the regimental commander at Officer Candidate School.
00:33:07.82 --> 00:33:10.94 And that was, you know, the number one position.
00:33:10.94 --> 00:33:11.94 Yeah.
00:33:11.94 --> 00:33:12.94 And I was.
00:33:12.94 --> 00:33:17.58 Yeah, I was talking to my mom.
00:33:17.58 --> 00:33:22.50 And I, I mentioned to which I shouldn't have done because my mom just doesn't understand.
00:33:22.50 --> 00:33:25.58 I was like, well, yeah, I'm, you know, I'm the, the regiment.
00:33:25.58 --> 00:33:27.90 She's, because at the last couple of weeks, I was yes.
00:33:27.90 --> 00:33:30.14 And I, she said, oh, so what's going on now?
00:33:30.14 --> 00:33:32.26 Because then I could call, because you weren't allowed to call.
00:33:32.26 --> 00:33:33.70 So I said, well, we're doing this.
00:33:33.70 --> 00:33:35.82 And I'm in charge of the thing here.
00:33:35.82 --> 00:33:37.26 It's called the regimental commander.
00:33:37.26 --> 00:33:39.30 And she goes, oh, what?
00:33:39.30 --> 00:33:43.46 What? But so you're the commander. And I said, yeah, the regimental commander.
00:33:43.46 --> 00:33:45.78 She goes, what do you in charge of?
00:33:45.78 --> 00:33:50.46 And I said, I am overseeing the cleaning of every toilet.
00:33:50.46 --> 00:33:51.66 And Officer Candidate School.
00:33:51.66 --> 00:33:52.70 And it's going quite well.
00:33:52.70 --> 00:33:56.34 So spotless spotless.
00:33:56.34 --> 00:34:00.22 Uh, you, so you do a great job in college.
00:34:00.22 --> 00:34:05.86 And now you go back to the teams after college going back to the book.
00:34:05.86 --> 00:34:10.74 Instead of having an advantage, I found myself left behind.
00:34:10.74 --> 00:34:11.90 Everything had changed.
00:34:11.90 --> 00:34:16.54 And as our platoon went through its training cycle, I always felt like I was playing catch-up.
00:34:16.54 --> 00:34:20.62 I made mistakes and exercises that I never made in the 90s.
00:34:20.62 --> 00:34:25.58 They made me edgy and tense, feeling the pressure of trying to be a leader and drinking from
00:34:25.58 --> 00:34:28.86 that training fire hose at the same time.
00:34:28.86 --> 00:34:34.02 I got tight and held on even harder, which only made things worse.
00:34:34.02 --> 00:34:40.70 And our time off, I drowned my frustrations and booze and routinely made an ass of myself.
00:34:40.70 --> 00:34:44.78 None of this was helping my credibility with the men I was supposed to be leading.
00:34:44.78 --> 00:34:47.46 But I didn't see that at the moment.
00:34:47.46 --> 00:34:52.78 It also didn't help that senior chief Pete Kerry and I despised each other almost from
00:34:52.78 --> 00:34:54.70 our introduction.
00:34:54.70 --> 00:34:59.10 He was a good skilled seal and I respected his tactical abilities, but I felt his people
00:34:59.10 --> 00:35:00.66 skills were lacking.
00:35:00.66 --> 00:35:03.94 And I was afraid of a lot of abrasive at times, his leadership style clashed with mine,
00:35:03.94 --> 00:35:07.70 which set us on a collision course.
00:35:07.70 --> 00:35:13.26 While I privately railed against Kerry, I was too blinded by arrogance to see my own flaws.
00:35:13.26 --> 00:35:16.18 I wasn't making a good transition to being an officer.
00:35:16.18 --> 00:35:17.94 I'd been enlisted for so long.
00:35:17.94 --> 00:35:22.86 I identified with mine listed teammates more as one of them, rather than as one of their
00:35:22.86 --> 00:35:24.02 leaders.
00:35:24.02 --> 00:35:27.30 It put me too far away from the fence.
00:35:27.30 --> 00:35:32.02 The senior chief and the AOIC are supposed to work closely together to make sure the team
00:35:32.02 --> 00:35:34.02 functions effectively.
00:35:34.02 --> 00:35:39.30 The AOIC and that's a system officer in charge is also supposed to learn from the chief's
00:35:39.30 --> 00:35:41.10 tactical experience.
00:35:41.10 --> 00:35:42.70 That never happened in Arpaltoon.
00:35:42.70 --> 00:35:46.66 Instead, I refused to humble myself and listen to the senior chief.
00:35:46.66 --> 00:35:52.54 As the pre-depulment work up war on, we couldn't conceal our dislike for each other.
00:35:52.54 --> 00:35:58.50 The feud spilled out into the open and culminated with a public screaming match in Europe after
00:35:58.50 --> 00:36:03.50 a tactical exercise with some NATO allies.
00:36:03.50 --> 00:36:07.74 In the weeks that followed my arrival within the team, our relationship became the cancer
00:36:07.74 --> 00:36:08.74 in our locker room.
00:36:08.74 --> 00:36:12.14 By the time we got to Afghanistan, we refused to be civilly to each other.
00:36:12.14 --> 00:36:15.06 I had lost touch entirely with what it meant to be a leader.
00:36:15.06 --> 00:36:18.94 During the daily briefs, we would openly take shots at each other.
00:36:18.94 --> 00:36:23.42 I talked about this dynamic many times with my superior, the Patoons Officer in charge.
00:36:23.42 --> 00:36:28.46 One day, the AOIC finally said, look, you do have to work to this out.
00:36:28.46 --> 00:36:29.62 I'm tired of it.
00:36:29.62 --> 00:36:33.66 We never could or did work things out.
00:36:33.66 --> 00:36:35.74 Different Patoons, structure things in different ways.
00:36:35.74 --> 00:36:39.34 In Arpaltoon, senior and elistic members acted as fire team leaders with chiefs and some
00:36:39.34 --> 00:36:42.46 more experienced officers acting as the assault force commanders.
00:36:42.46 --> 00:36:44.54 I'd been assigned as neither.
00:36:44.54 --> 00:36:48.38 If I'd taken a step back, I might have realized that I hadn't given my bosses much
00:36:48.38 --> 00:36:51.26 confidence in my leadership, but I didn't see that.
00:36:51.26 --> 00:36:56.94 I only felt slighted and in bitter.
00:36:56.94 --> 00:36:59.90 Rough tour.
00:36:59.90 --> 00:37:01.94 But all brought on by myself.
00:37:01.94 --> 00:37:09.38 The dynamics obviously created some interesting problems.
00:37:09.38 --> 00:37:15.26 As often happens, I wasn't taking ownership of my own actions.
00:37:15.26 --> 00:37:18.94 Instead, I was just trying to point fingers externally.
00:37:18.94 --> 00:37:22.22 It's peak Gary's fault that these things are happening.
00:37:22.22 --> 00:37:27.38 When the reality was 80% of it was me.
00:37:27.38 --> 00:37:29.38 80% of it.
00:37:29.38 --> 00:37:32.46 It's one of the things that I talk to a lot of individuals about.
00:37:32.46 --> 00:37:34.50 I think you see it in special operations.
00:37:34.50 --> 00:37:39.02 You and I have both of spoken to professional sports teams.
00:37:39.02 --> 00:37:44.82 I see it there where young men accelerate quickly and achieve this elite status.
00:37:44.82 --> 00:37:49.26 And then get a little bit of enamored with who they are and their abilities.
00:37:49.26 --> 00:37:55.22 And lose sight of the end state, which is to be an effective part of the team to do their
00:37:55.22 --> 00:37:59.78 job so ruthlessly well, it plays this huge part in the team.
00:37:59.78 --> 00:38:03.58 At the end of the day, whether you're in professional sports, whether you're in the
00:38:03.58 --> 00:38:09.50 SEAL teams, or either whether you're in some elite business, that's what has to happen.
00:38:09.50 --> 00:38:16.98 And I lost sight of that.
00:38:16.98 --> 00:38:19.98 And more focused externally, instead of internally.
00:38:19.98 --> 00:38:21.98 And really, now I speak a lot on what my three rules of leadership is and the foundational
00:38:21.98 --> 00:38:25.58 the first rule is lead yourself.
00:38:25.58 --> 00:38:30.18 And how you lead yourself, 80% of leadership is leading yourself.
00:38:30.18 --> 00:38:31.98 You talk so much about discipline.
00:38:31.98 --> 00:38:33.30 It's how you discipline yourself.
00:38:33.30 --> 00:38:34.54 It's how you structure yourself.
00:38:34.54 --> 00:38:35.54 It's how you push yourself.
00:38:35.54 --> 00:38:41.18 It's how you set the example.
00:38:41.18 --> 00:38:43.30 And in doing so, it automatically leads to rule number two, lead others.
00:38:43.30 --> 00:38:46.58 It almost makes it easy to lead others because you've already done all the work.
00:38:46.58 --> 00:38:49.14 They want to follow you because you're setting the example.
00:38:49.14 --> 00:38:50.30 I kind of had it backwards.
00:38:50.30 --> 00:38:54.30 I was trying to lead others, but I wasn't leading myself.
00:38:54.30 --> 00:38:56.42 And it's almost impossible to do.
00:38:56.42 --> 00:39:01.14 And I meet all these people that have gone out in business and talked to them and they say,
00:39:01.14 --> 00:39:07.58 hey man, how do I be a better leader?
00:39:07.58 --> 00:39:12.10 Because that's where I really, really failed.
00:39:12.10 --> 00:39:16.98 We talk in several times you've mentioned a principle I talk about called the leadership
00:39:16.98 --> 00:39:18.78 fence.
00:39:18.78 --> 00:39:22.62 And a leadership fence was just kind of a concept that came up with after watching a lot
00:39:22.62 --> 00:39:28.34 of really good leaders and bad leaders, including myself in that category.
00:39:28.34 --> 00:39:29.66 Years later, I looked back.
00:39:29.66 --> 00:39:33.54 And the idea was this, that imagine a chain link fence.
00:39:33.54 --> 00:39:37.58 And that fence represents where you are in your leadership journey.
00:39:37.58 --> 00:39:42.78 And on one side of the fence are all those you lead and on the other side are those
00:39:42.78 --> 00:39:45.74 you report to your peers.
00:39:45.74 --> 00:39:49.22 Everybody has a natural tendency to kind of fall on one side of the fence or the other
00:39:49.22 --> 00:39:53.58 depending on how they grew up or how they came into the organization.
00:39:53.58 --> 00:39:59.46 For me, obviously, when you start out as anyone, I connected a lot more with the guys
00:39:59.46 --> 00:40:02.74 on the side of the fence that I was leading.
00:40:02.74 --> 00:40:09.02 As a matter of fact, the teams back then typically wanted to switch coasts with guys.
00:40:09.02 --> 00:40:12.78 Bjorn and Lys guy, they wanted to send you out to the opposite coast.
00:40:12.78 --> 00:40:14.38 And that didn't happen for me.
00:40:14.38 --> 00:40:18.38 And I tell you what, I look back on that now and I think that was a mistake.
00:40:18.38 --> 00:40:23.10 I created a lot of my own problems and the seal teams were right in there thinking
00:40:23.10 --> 00:40:24.42 on how to do that.
00:40:24.42 --> 00:40:30.78 Because now the hardest leadership often is peer leadership to break through those bonds
00:40:30.78 --> 00:40:34.74 of hey, you and I were both friends, but now I'm in charge of you.
00:40:34.74 --> 00:40:36.62 So how do we navigate that water?
00:40:36.62 --> 00:40:40.82 And if you're close with those people, it makes it a lot more difficult.
00:40:40.82 --> 00:40:43.54 You have to be the one that really has to break those bonds.
00:40:43.54 --> 00:40:47.18 And sometimes a can damage friendships if you're not careful with that.
00:40:47.18 --> 00:40:49.50 And I think I was more focused on retaining that.
00:40:49.50 --> 00:40:51.98 So that was on one side of the fence.
00:40:51.98 --> 00:40:55.66 And those side of fence a lot of times, you see individuals that come into an organization
00:40:55.66 --> 00:40:58.46 later at a higher leadership position.
00:40:58.46 --> 00:41:02.66 So they get brought in as an officer, they get brought in as a leader to a company.
00:41:02.66 --> 00:41:07.50 And they're more focused on that leadership position that they don't take the time to get
00:41:07.50 --> 00:41:10.02 to know the people they're leading.
00:41:10.02 --> 00:41:11.98 So they're too far away from the fence.
00:41:11.98 --> 00:41:16.22 It's a chain link fence so that you can talk through it so that you can communicate through
00:41:16.22 --> 00:41:17.22 it.
00:41:17.22 --> 00:41:20.58 And the best leaders have the ability to be right up against that fence.
00:41:20.58 --> 00:41:26.42 So whether they're on either side, they're able to turn around and gain guidance from the
00:41:26.42 --> 00:41:30.86 individuals, whether it's their leadership and communicate it through to those they lead,
00:41:30.86 --> 00:41:34.82 or whether they're on the side of communicating and interacting with those they lead and
00:41:34.82 --> 00:41:40.78 communicating through and getting guidance from who they follow.
00:41:40.78 --> 00:41:43.86 Problems arise when you're too far away from the fence.
00:41:43.86 --> 00:41:47.62 The leaders who are so far on the other side of the fence and all they're thinking about
00:41:47.62 --> 00:41:50.06 is how do I make the next rank?
00:41:50.06 --> 00:41:51.06 We know who they are.
00:41:51.06 --> 00:41:55.98 I mean we've seen those guys who literally you think, man, you would like kill your mother
00:41:55.98 --> 00:41:59.42 to make the next rank to be this or be that.
00:41:59.42 --> 00:42:04.98 And then we also know those guys who they have no aspirations to try and get better on the
00:42:04.98 --> 00:42:05.98 other side of the fence.
00:42:05.98 --> 00:42:10.22 I mean we joke about the career E5s, the perfectly content.
00:42:10.22 --> 00:42:16.06 The magic position and the seal teams where you're at that level where you're high enough
00:42:16.06 --> 00:42:20.86 above to not do the groundwork but you don't really have tremendous responsibilities.
00:42:20.86 --> 00:42:22.50 I was way too far away.
00:42:22.50 --> 00:42:26.70 That was the bottom line and this is where I was tremendously failing and not setting the
00:42:26.70 --> 00:42:27.70 example.
00:42:27.70 --> 00:42:32.38 I wasn't communicating with the leadership.
00:42:32.38 --> 00:42:36.66 They were trying to provide me guidance and basically saying, hey dude, you're screwing things
00:42:36.66 --> 00:42:43.78 up and even Pete Carrey himself was trying to convey to me in his very abrasive way.
00:42:43.78 --> 00:42:50.10 They do it, you know, this is not the way you do things but I was blinded both by having
00:42:50.10 --> 00:42:57.98 excelled at this point in my career really rocketing up and thinking, oh I know these things,
00:42:57.98 --> 00:43:00.02 you know I'm the man.
00:43:00.02 --> 00:43:04.18 So humility is such a critical component of leadership to take that step back and if anybody
00:43:04.18 --> 00:43:11.62 is given you advice, always take a second to think through it and evaluate, hey, even
00:43:11.62 --> 00:43:15.42 if maybe you don't think it applies, there's probably pieces of it that do.
00:43:15.42 --> 00:43:16.42 That's the reality.
00:43:16.42 --> 00:43:21.82 Yeah, I was with someone's giving me critique points, you know and of course and it's
00:43:21.82 --> 00:43:27.58 every single I say every single person on earth doesn't like receiving critique like
00:43:27.58 --> 00:43:32.62 and I always joke about the fact that even when someone asks for criticism, when they get
00:43:32.62 --> 00:43:33.62 it, they still get mad.
00:43:33.62 --> 00:43:36.82 Even I say, hey Jay, would you, you know, read this thing that I just wrote and tell me
00:43:36.82 --> 00:43:39.82 what you think of it and then you read it and you say, you know, I thought it was a little
00:43:39.82 --> 00:43:44.02 you could do this a little bit better. I'm going to be mad, right? Everyone gets mad.
00:43:44.02 --> 00:43:48.02 And so that's so what I do is the same thing. I take a step back when somebody gives
00:43:48.02 --> 00:43:52.50 me a critique point, even though I'm completely offended and I don't agree with them
00:43:52.50 --> 00:43:55.54 and I think I'm right because I'm an egotistical maniac.
00:43:55.54 --> 00:43:58.62 I put all that aside and I say, wait a second, there's a reason that they're telling
00:43:58.62 --> 00:44:01.78 me this, there's gotta be some truth to it.
00:44:01.78 --> 00:44:09.62 I like, I'm one of my favorite things about this book is the fact that it reveals the
00:44:09.62 --> 00:44:14.82 difficulties that we have in the Syltimes which are the same difficulties that I see all
00:44:14.82 --> 00:44:18.42 the time. So people think, oh, and you're in the Syltimes, everyone's just perfect.
00:44:18.42 --> 00:44:24.62 And you know, this, this, p, carry would be the perfect mentor and you'd just be able to
00:44:24.62 --> 00:44:30.22 come along and then you'd be the perfect recipient, the perfect mentee, ready to learn
00:44:30.22 --> 00:44:35.70 and everything's just perfect and it's actually completely untrue and what you have in
00:44:35.70 --> 00:44:41.30 the Syltimes actually in the, like, in the civilian sector and companies and organizations,
00:44:41.30 --> 00:44:45.06 they have these personality, you know, different personalities in the Syltimes and so you
00:44:45.06 --> 00:44:48.78 think, oh, in the Syltimes, you don't have that. No, you actually have it worse because
00:44:48.78 --> 00:44:53.66 you got these guys that have, that have really built their egos been built up and we all
00:44:53.66 --> 00:44:56.86 think we're great. We all think we're tactical genius. We all think we don't have anything
00:44:56.86 --> 00:45:05.14 to learn and so we have a lot of issues around this exact kind of thing and it does completely
00:45:05.14 --> 00:45:11.66 derail, not just leaders, but it derails, p, tunes and I mean, we would disband p, tunes.
00:45:11.66 --> 00:45:14.74 And when we were disband, p, tune, that means the p, tune is no longer going to exist.
00:45:14.74 --> 00:45:18.38 We'd have a p, tune coming through training. The p, tune would get disbanded. It doesn't
00:45:18.38 --> 00:45:25.50 happen very often, but it happens. Yeah. And when it happens, it has zero to do with the
00:45:25.50 --> 00:45:29.86 e-force e-fives and usually the e-sixes and it has a hundred percent to do with the senior
00:45:29.86 --> 00:45:36.10 e-sixes, the chiefs and the officers inside the p, tune that just our disasters. And it
00:45:36.10 --> 00:45:40.90 does happen and I think the fact that you, the fact that you talk through some of these
00:45:40.90 --> 00:45:46.22 issues are, I mean, that's what that's what's very revealing about the Syltimes in this
00:45:46.22 --> 00:45:52.14 book is like, hey, we got, you know, we got the same issues that they have in other
00:45:52.14 --> 00:45:58.10 or any other team, any other organization. And that, that, you know, that thing that you
00:45:58.10 --> 00:46:02.18 talk about this, this fence, you know, that's to me. That's the dichotomy leadership, right?
00:46:02.18 --> 00:46:05.24 That's like, you can go to foreign one direction or the other. And if you go to foreign
00:46:05.24 --> 00:46:14.90 one direction or the other, you're going to fall apart. Yeah. So check. All right. Now you're
00:46:14.90 --> 00:46:19.14 on deployment. And I've got to say, and I always, I always mentioned this. I haven't
00:46:19.14 --> 00:46:24.42 mentioned it yet, but I'll mention it right now because I'm only reading small portions
00:46:24.42 --> 00:46:29.38 of this book and there's so much more great detail in the book. And you'll have a better
00:46:29.38 --> 00:46:34.02 understanding of these lessons when you, when you read the whole thing. So if it seems a
00:46:34.02 --> 00:46:37.66 little bit, you know, it seems it's jumping around a little bit. It's just because I'm
00:46:37.66 --> 00:46:40.38 only reading chunks of it because I'm not going to read the whole damn book. You can read
00:46:40.38 --> 00:46:46.90 it yourself. All right. So now speaking of jumping around, you're in Afghanistan. You had
00:46:46.90 --> 00:46:53.58 a mission go down where it sounded like you guys got some bad intel and it caused a little
00:46:53.58 --> 00:46:58.58 of a problem. You hit the target pretty hard and you guys got put on an operational pause.
00:46:58.58 --> 00:47:03.98 Meaning, hey, you guys aren't going to do anything. And that's a great story and how that
00:47:03.98 --> 00:47:08.18 unfolds is great and people should read so they can learn lessons from that. But then I'm
00:47:08.18 --> 00:47:15.38 going to go skip a lesson here. You are in the chow hall and you're sitting with some
00:47:15.38 --> 00:47:20.06 of your boys. And I'm specifically using that term because at this point, you definitely
00:47:20.06 --> 00:47:24.70 are, we're boys with the boys and I'm going to the book. I've been searching for a way
00:47:24.70 --> 00:47:30.06 to prove myself ever since I'd come aboard. Now the opportunity to do so had just fallen
00:47:30.06 --> 00:47:35.94 into my lap. I had to take it. In time, I learned there was nothing more dangerous on the
00:47:35.94 --> 00:47:41.30 battlefield than an immature and arrogant officer who feels he needs to prove himself. It
00:47:41.30 --> 00:47:45.30 can lead men to their death. And what you're looking at is you happen to be sitting in the
00:47:45.30 --> 00:47:52.94 chow hall with the commanding general. And these guys kind of, your, your boys kind of
00:47:52.94 --> 00:47:58.70 egg you on to go talk to him about, hey, why are we, why are we standing down in your
00:47:58.70 --> 00:48:04.22 and incident at this point? Yeah. Oh, Jesus. Okay. So here we go. I walked over and stood
00:48:04.22 --> 00:48:09.30 beside the general's table. Excuse me, general. Encin redmond, naval special warfare. Do
00:48:09.30 --> 00:48:14.30 you have a couple of minutes? His aides gloured up at me stamped on their faces is a
00:48:14.30 --> 00:48:20.70 crew the hell are you. Look, that made me momentarily waver. The general invited me to sit
00:48:20.70 --> 00:48:25.50 down. His aides looked frosted and grew more so after I began to talk. Sorry, I just wanted
00:48:25.50 --> 00:48:30.62 to talk to you about this operational pause. We still seem to be in. I began. The general's
00:48:30.62 --> 00:48:35.30 face registering nothing but interest. I continued. I know there was a miscommunication
00:48:35.30 --> 00:48:38.82 with our first mission, but we know the enemies out there and we'd really like to take the
00:48:38.82 --> 00:48:43.82 opportunity to go after them. The general heard me out, then replied diplomatically. Well,
00:48:43.82 --> 00:48:47.86 Johnson, I've got to look at all the strategic factors here. We must always weigh the
00:48:47.86 --> 00:48:51.74 strategic impact with the impact on the civilian populace and there are implications
00:48:51.74 --> 00:48:56.74 to going out and operating at night. I understand that, sir. Right now, we're at a crazy
00:48:56.74 --> 00:49:02.58 time in the war and we have to balance what we're doing. Well, general, I said, I can hardly
00:49:02.58 --> 00:49:07.06 read that with a straight face. Well, general, I said, we really feel like we can contribute
00:49:07.06 --> 00:49:11.14 in a positive way to by going after the men who pose a clear and present threat to coalition
00:49:11.14 --> 00:49:16.26 forces. General's non-committal, but remained polite. I don't think his AIDS took their eyes
00:49:16.26 --> 00:49:20.10 off me through the entire conversation. I could feel them boring holes through me. I
00:49:20.10 --> 00:49:25.54 thanked them for their time got up and headed back to my table. The other two operators
00:49:25.54 --> 00:49:40.98 were gone. Why hadn't they stuck around? Get some. Yeah, beware of peer pressure.
00:49:40.98 --> 00:49:47.98 Beware, once again, it comes back to that lead yourself, lead yourself that founding principle.
00:49:47.98 --> 00:49:54.54 Because this was a dangerous thing and I did this several times during that deployment.
00:49:54.54 --> 00:50:01.14 This misunderstanding or this idea that somehow there's this shortcut to being an effective
00:50:01.14 --> 00:50:06.78 leader that there's this push button easy button that, look at me, now I'm a great leader
00:50:06.78 --> 00:50:16.58 and this really was this moment. People understand this was an interesting time. This was
00:50:16.58 --> 00:50:25.46 July of 2005. June 28, the 2005 operation Red Wings had just happened and that was our
00:50:25.46 --> 00:50:33.82 troop. We had lost five of our guys including our troop commander. We had lost my error
00:50:33.82 --> 00:50:38.74 Christian sin. We had lost my good friend in the OIC at that platoon, Mike McGreevey.
00:50:38.74 --> 00:50:46.78 I originally was in Echo Platoon. We had trained alongside those guys. We were all grieving
00:50:46.78 --> 00:50:53.34 and we all wanted revenge. We all wanted to go after the enemy. The very first mission we
00:50:53.34 --> 00:50:59.34 did was the mission you talked about that got us in a little bit of trouble. Now take the
00:50:59.34 --> 00:51:08.34 dynamics of everybody grieving because of the loss of our teammates and then doing our
00:51:08.34 --> 00:51:14.38 first mission and being put in hack because of really some outstanding issues that you
00:51:14.38 --> 00:51:18.22 can read about in the book. We had actually done everything right but it kind of got
00:51:18.22 --> 00:51:24.98 placed back on us. I just, it's these moments that as a young leader, whether you're in
00:51:24.98 --> 00:51:29.74 the business, whether you're in the military law enforcement, whatever you do that you
00:51:29.74 --> 00:51:37.18 see this shortcut. Oh look what I can do. It got fueled when my teammates and I sat there
00:51:37.18 --> 00:51:46.18 and started talking and teammates were the biggest chitalkers on the planet. They definitely
00:51:46.18 --> 00:51:50.54 were agonized and I ate it up. Hook line and sinker and I was like you are absolutely right.
00:51:50.54 --> 00:51:58.14 There is a great opportunity for me to shed some amazing wisdom and insight to this general
00:51:58.14 --> 00:52:02.70 where he now is going to be like oh young innocent you're so right. We should absolutely
00:52:02.70 --> 00:52:08.14 allow you guys to go out and conduct all these operations because I'm not smart enough
00:52:08.14 --> 00:52:14.90 to allow this to happen. The arrogance that I had and really sad that I didn't think
00:52:14.90 --> 00:52:19.50 through what are the implications of this for you to go do that.
00:52:19.50 --> 00:52:26.02 It was just a stupid decision and I realized it. As soon as those guys were gone like
00:52:26.02 --> 00:52:35.94 all the sudden I'm like, huh. What did you just do more on? And as I walk back from
00:52:35.94 --> 00:52:43.58 the chial hall to our camp, I was like this isn't going to go on. You didn't told your
00:52:43.58 --> 00:52:47.82 boss that you did it right. I did it. I was straight back to my CEO and I said hey I want
00:52:47.82 --> 00:52:56.66 to let you know what just happened. I thought it was a good idea and I don't think it
00:52:56.66 --> 00:53:03.10 was. It was funny. He kind of looked at me and he said why did you think that was a good
00:53:03.10 --> 00:53:13.86 idea? And I said why I was doing it for the boys. It was about the boys. You really
00:53:13.86 --> 00:53:20.86 wasn't. At the end of the day it was about me and that's where you know really understanding
00:53:20.86 --> 00:53:27.94 that you know in leadership you are the last point in the equation and don't get me wrong.
00:53:27.94 --> 00:53:31.74 You know there's an overlap of everything that happens that we do. So oftentimes you're
00:53:31.74 --> 00:53:35.34 focused on the mission you're focused on the man and of course by doing that well there
00:53:35.34 --> 00:53:40.06 is a positive impact for you and there's nothing wrong with that. But that thought process
00:53:40.06 --> 00:53:46.42 it should be it should be by sequence if you will not because you're focused on it.
00:53:46.42 --> 00:53:51.14 Yeah no 100% and you're right the by product of focusing on your people and focusing on
00:53:51.14 --> 00:53:56.86 your mission the by product of that is you'll be successful and the contrary the contrary
00:53:56.86 --> 00:54:02.46 in situation is literally if you focus on yourself instead of your people and your mission
00:54:02.46 --> 00:54:08.06 you will fail you will you and you know what fails a strong word because there's people
00:54:08.06 --> 00:54:12.94 and you and I know them who have focused on themselves and they they they they can win
00:54:12.94 --> 00:54:15.90 this battle and they can win this tactical battle and they can win this tactical battle
00:54:15.90 --> 00:54:21.30 and they can get to a certain point but eventually it will come back on them and you won't
00:54:21.30 --> 00:54:26.78 be as truly successful as if you would as you would have been had you focused on the
00:54:26.78 --> 00:54:33.30 man the mission and not focused on yourself. I call those people leadership wrecking balls
00:54:33.30 --> 00:54:38.70 they're good at what they do you know in some ways peak carriers one of those people
00:54:38.70 --> 00:54:44.34 he was very good at what he did and he got things done but he had a tendency to leave
00:54:44.34 --> 00:54:49.10 and a lot of organizations have these individuals and they keep them around because
00:54:49.10 --> 00:54:53.14 they do get things done but they leave a path of destruction behind them and over time
00:54:53.14 --> 00:54:57.42 people don't want to work with them and you know that's why I call them the leadership
00:54:57.42 --> 00:55:01.62 wrecking ball so you know I tell people you need to evaluate yourself are you one of those
00:55:01.62 --> 00:55:05.70 people do you turn around you know forward you look at the successes you have but you turn
00:55:05.70 --> 00:55:10.10 around and look and there's a path of destruction going away there no doubt about it.
00:55:10.10 --> 00:55:16.86 All right so you guys eventually do get back in the game you the the pause operational
00:55:16.86 --> 00:55:22.70 pause gets lifted and you guys are operating again and here you are out on an operation
00:55:22.70 --> 00:55:27.70 you're in an Overwatch position on a hilltop going back to the book between bursts
00:55:27.70 --> 00:55:32.34 of gunfire I heard in report troops and contact troops and contact we're facing at least
00:55:32.34 --> 00:55:38.82 20 enemy fighters a wash of static followed then I heard Joker add one of our afghan soldiers
00:55:38.82 --> 00:55:42.42 is wounded we need reinforcements.
00:55:42.42 --> 00:55:47.78 Jay here's your chance your teammates are in trouble I looked down into the value thousand
00:55:47.78 --> 00:55:52.66 feet below the slope was steep perhaps 60 degrees in places getting down there would be a
00:55:52.66 --> 00:55:58.18 serious climb once at the bottom we'd have to maneuver to the sound of the guns through broken
00:55:58.18 --> 00:56:03.86 terrain and vegetation that would complicate approaching our guys without getting shot by accident.
00:56:03.86 --> 00:56:09.30 I called the Fred and asked if the western Overwatch team was still in place gunfire erupted
00:56:09.30 --> 00:56:15.86 over the radio as he heat his mic and answered I think so okay good that gave us eyes above
00:56:15.86 --> 00:56:20.90 and control over the high ground over there this is the moment Jay go prove yourself
00:56:20.90 --> 00:56:27.70 as we dropped off the lip senior chief carry called to me over the radio and wanted to know
00:56:27.70 --> 00:56:34.34 what I was doing we're going down I told him he went ballistic absolutely not we need to link
00:56:34.34 --> 00:56:42.10 back up fall back the boys needed help and we were closest if it had been anybody else I might
00:56:42.10 --> 00:56:47.06 have thought twice about his call but my own personal quest to prove myself coupled with my
00:56:47.06 --> 00:56:55.46 intense hatred for him clouded my judgment I ignored him and we pressed on as we dropped further into
00:56:55.46 --> 00:57:00.74 the valley we lost all communication with the headquarters team I began to realize what a
00:57:00.74 --> 00:57:05.70 hairy situation I had just placed the two of us in we had given up the high ground to move down
00:57:05.70 --> 00:57:10.18 a thousand feet of vertical terrain to try and link up with an element under fire with an enemy
00:57:10.18 --> 00:57:16.42 force almost one kilometer away I pushed this thought to the back of my mind the boys need help
00:57:16.42 --> 00:57:22.42 focus on that but where was the fight the sounds of battle echoed all across the valley making it
00:57:22.42 --> 00:57:28.82 difficult to calculate distance and direction a broken transmission filled my earpiece I couldn't
00:57:28.82 --> 00:57:34.58 tell what it was but I recognized Jaydee's voice I tried to establish contact a moment later
00:57:34.58 --> 00:57:39.70 through washers of static Jaydee's voice came back where the hell are you Jaydee demanded
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:45.86 I told him we were at the tea intersection on the valley floor get your ass out of the valley now
00:57:45.86 --> 00:57:50.74 he said with so much anger I could almost feel a blast of fire shoot out of the earpiece I was
00:57:50.74 --> 00:57:55.94 about to explain my intent when he added those guys are in a major fight and we can't call in
00:57:55.94 --> 00:58:03.70 close air support because we don't know where you are that shook me there were aircraft over
00:58:03.70 --> 00:58:08.34 head waiting to join the battle with rockets and bombs yet they could not make their runs because
00:58:08.34 --> 00:58:15.30 of my decision to go into the valley I should have thought about art air assets but I was too blinded
00:58:15.30 --> 00:58:22.26 by my own ambition with my combat experience on full display it started to dawn on me at last
00:58:22.26 --> 00:58:27.30 had I made a mistake what if somebody got hit during the delay I'd caused I'd keep my radio and
00:58:27.30 --> 00:58:31.06 reported that we would be pulling out of the valley and climbing up the north face of the
00:58:31.06 --> 00:58:37.06 tea intersection to link up with our element there once we were consolidated on the north ridge
00:58:37.06 --> 00:58:42.58 and our security was set for what was surely be a long night ahead Jaydee came looking for me
00:58:42.58 --> 00:58:48.66 as he approached I could see he was livid what the hell were you doing and dignitely I told him I
00:58:48.66 --> 00:58:53.70 was trying to go to the aid of my brothers he looked at me like I just spit on his wife
00:58:54.66 --> 00:59:00.82 that was a stupid thing you did red you could have gotten people killed his words made me even
00:59:00.82 --> 00:59:05.38 more right to sleep in dignity I fired back at him the boys were in trouble and I went to their
00:59:05.38 --> 00:59:11.38 aid I did what I needed to be done in the moment Jaydee refused to accept that I tossed out a
00:59:11.38 --> 00:59:16.50 similar situation that occurred in Afghanistan a few years before as if established establishing
00:59:16.50 --> 00:59:21.38 precedence would help my case Jaydee knew the mission too and he cut me off with not the
00:59:21.38 --> 00:59:27.86 same at all red they didn't have air support available I didn't know I know he did I shouted back
00:59:27.86 --> 00:59:33.94 you delayed it with what you did Jaydee roared at last when it was clear to Jaydee that his words
00:59:33.94 --> 00:59:38.74 were not sinking in he ended the argument currently he said we'll deal this when we after when we
00:59:38.74 --> 00:59:44.34 get back to Canada hard he turned and stalked off I watched him leave and struggled with my own
00:59:44.34 --> 00:59:51.78 thoughts had I really made that big of a mistake no no way I went to help when is that ever wrong
00:59:58.98 --> 01:00:07.46 bro that's rough you know a lot of people read that section who don't have
01:00:07.46 --> 01:00:13.38 tactical background and they don't fully understand they're like oh man no you did the heroic thing
01:00:13.38 --> 01:00:17.14 you went down into the battle you know you tried to take the fight to the enemy but
01:00:17.54 --> 01:00:21.78 no I tried to explain to them you know you don't have a tactical understanding you know there are so
01:00:21.78 --> 01:00:29.94 many things that were done wrong there that it literally and this story would be so different
01:00:29.94 --> 01:00:34.26 if something had actually happened and the potential for something to have gone wrong is true
01:00:34.26 --> 01:00:39.38 the roof I mean you've been an Afghanist and I mean you know the fighting positions and basically
01:00:39.38 --> 01:00:45.94 I took myself off a very advantageous high ground position that we owned down into the valley
01:00:45.94 --> 01:00:50.26 a thousand feet below I mean there could have been hundreds of fighting positions and caves above
01:00:50.26 --> 01:00:55.70 me that any one single fighter could have just decimated us and I know what have been one thing
01:00:55.70 --> 01:01:02.34 if I got myself killed but I pulled a young team guy machine gunner down with me so I placed this
01:01:02.34 --> 01:01:09.62 guy's life in jeopardy and you know the funny thing is you know I tried to paint it in that moment
01:01:09.62 --> 01:01:14.18 arguing with J.D that I was doing the right thing I'm taking the fight to the enemy I'm you know
01:01:14.18 --> 01:01:19.46 supporting my brothers and all this BS you know the reality was I wanted to get in the fight
01:01:20.02 --> 01:01:26.10 at that point I had been on the edge of a lot of fire fights and you know and even
01:01:26.10 --> 01:01:33.22 fighting I'm in until you get in there you haven't proved yourself and I wanted to prove myself
01:01:33.22 --> 01:01:40.74 I wanted to prove myself both as a seal as a fighter and as a leader and this was another moment
01:01:40.74 --> 01:01:51.54 just like the general where I thought here's my opportunity and and I was so unwilling to listen
01:01:51.54 --> 01:01:57.70 you know that I had made a mistake and the reality is if I had owned it in that moment it probably
01:01:57.70 --> 01:02:04.66 would not have been as bad as it was but the mere fact that I just planted my flag on that spot and
01:02:04.66 --> 01:02:11.54 was like screw you you're wrong I'm right and I did the right thing I think just turned what was
01:02:11.54 --> 01:02:20.26 a fire into a raging inferno yeah yeah no that's definitely rough and I think also
01:02:22.50 --> 01:02:28.42 from a from a tactical perspective people make mistakes like this like it can happen and it can
01:02:28.42 --> 01:02:33.38 happen and you know I talk about being able to detach and that's something that I definitely learned
01:02:33.38 --> 01:02:40.74 in the seal teams and it was I think one of the most advantageous skills for a leader especially
01:02:40.74 --> 01:02:45.94 a combat leader to have is to be able to to step back from the situation as it's unfolding
01:02:46.58 --> 01:02:54.50 because if you fully knew hey we've got air overhead and they're in a firefight and if I go
01:02:54.50 --> 01:03:01.30 down there we won't be able to use air support you wouldn't have done this even even a 60
01:03:01.30 --> 01:03:06.50 gunner you know even a pig gunner would say oh okay no I need to I need to let that that unfold
01:03:06.50 --> 01:03:13.54 but you know you're excited to get down there and and get in the fight is definitely you know
01:03:13.54 --> 01:03:20.02 let's something that that can grab a hold of of anyone if they're not careful and and again
01:03:20.02 --> 01:03:25.46 it's what we just talked about with you at that moment put yourself ahead of the mission ahead of
01:03:25.46 --> 01:03:32.18 the team and and then yeah I mean this idea of ownership and you know when I when I
01:03:32.18 --> 01:03:37.46 kick off the book that I wrote with a extreme ownership you know kicks off with a blue on blue
01:03:38.26 --> 01:03:43.14 and you know it was it was a lot of bad things happening there was a lot of moving parts going on
01:03:43.14 --> 01:03:47.14 it was a horrible situation and a rocky soldier got killed several more got wounded one of my
01:03:47.14 --> 01:03:54.42 guys got wounded and I can tell you right now like I think if I would have said hey this wasn't
01:03:54.42 --> 01:03:59.30 my fault blame it on someone else I think I would have gotten fired about in about three seconds
01:03:59.30 --> 01:04:07.54 because it's just a it's a bad situation unfold and yeah you plant in the flag on that is
01:04:08.26 --> 01:04:15.22 is rough and and I mean your humility and putting this out there is awesome and people can
01:04:15.22 --> 01:04:20.82 learn so much from that because if you recognize how easily you and you know okay let's let's
01:04:20.82 --> 01:04:24.50 let's paint you in a bad light that you were young and you were but let's paint you in a good
01:04:24.50 --> 01:04:28.10 light even with you had those qualities of being hyper aggressive and you wanted to get in the
01:04:28.10 --> 01:04:32.58 fight and and you're you were a little bit arrogant you're still a team guy that's trying to do
01:04:32.58 --> 01:04:37.46 good job but wasn't like you were trying to do a bad job so to recognize like hey even if you're
01:04:37.46 --> 01:04:43.14 well-intentioned if you don't pay attention to these things they can grab hold of you and they can
01:04:43.14 --> 01:04:48.74 pull you in a wrong direction and and you look up and and you're you're you're planting your flag
01:04:48.74 --> 01:04:54.66 and and putting up your defenses around an indefensible position which is where you ended up here
01:04:54.66 --> 01:05:00.74 and and you nailed it with the idea you know it's something I know you talked people about a business
01:05:00.74 --> 01:05:05.30 I talk about I think it's no different probably and fighting you know you've got to let the
01:05:05.30 --> 01:05:11.30 battle feel developed sometimes we have this natural instinct that when something bad happens when
01:05:11.30 --> 01:05:16.74 a crisis happens we feel this you know oh my god I got to react immediately before we actually
01:05:16.74 --> 01:05:22.58 take the time and even in a gunfight you typically have a few seconds and it's amazing how much
01:05:22.58 --> 01:05:30.26 information we can process in a few seconds before we react and move and so that was one problem
01:05:31.22 --> 01:05:37.86 and the other problem and you know was I was driven by this relationship
01:05:39.30 --> 01:05:45.22 issue and it's funny you know the individual the retired master chief that you were with on you know
01:05:45.22 --> 01:05:52.26 Thursday who was I served under him twice later we had talked about that exact situation
01:05:52.26 --> 01:05:57.38 and he had given me advice later and he said never let your personal feelings get in the way of
01:05:57.38 --> 01:06:03.14 your professional relationships and I had I absolutely let my personal feelings drive that and that
01:06:03.14 --> 01:06:08.42 was probably the biggest eff you moment you know like I said if it'd been anybody else but my
01:06:08.42 --> 01:06:14.02 hatred for him had grown to the point that I was just like you know let me show you buddy you know and
01:06:14.02 --> 01:06:19.94 so all these things you know dangerous you know that not only did you know all these things you
01:06:19.94 --> 01:06:24.82 have to be careful of I mean this is what falls under you know a lot of people call these different
01:06:24.82 --> 01:06:29.14 things and my Pentagon of peak performance I call it emotional leadership so your ability to
01:06:29.14 --> 01:06:33.54 attach yourself for a second and say okay I'm not going to let my own personal feelings drive this
01:06:33.54 --> 01:06:38.90 because what's going on around me my ability to lead and make the right decisions is more critical
01:06:38.90 --> 01:06:45.70 than what I feel and obviously you know I had not learned those lessons yet I was on that
01:06:45.70 --> 01:06:51.70 on that glide path and at this point I was on the glide path down I was crashing and burning rough rough
01:06:52.74 --> 01:06:57.78 going back to the book back at Canahar I heard the first whispers about me floating around the team
01:06:57.78 --> 01:07:03.70 the men had nicknamed me Rambo Red though some may think being compared to Stallone's lone wolf
01:07:03.70 --> 01:07:09.86 silver screen icon was a compliment with our community it was a supreme insult in the seal teams there's
01:07:09.86 --> 01:07:17.38 no room for individualism foundations of our success rest on mutual cooperation and communication
01:07:17.38 --> 01:07:23.70 alone wolf like Rambo could destroy a team with catastrophic effects on the battlefield
01:07:24.98 --> 01:07:30.18 after we debriefed the mission J.D. Richardson took me into his makeshift's office and said
01:07:30.18 --> 01:07:33.94 red your operational abilities have been called into question we're sending you back to
01:07:33.94 --> 01:07:39.70 the bathroom to meet with the seal and we'll discuss this further when the rest of the team gets back. I was stunned
01:07:40.66 --> 01:07:45.70 at worst I was starting to expect something more than a wrist slap but nothing like that.
01:07:46.66 --> 01:07:53.38 I was being sent back to the rear out of combat nothing can ever be more humiliating for a warrior
01:07:54.26 --> 01:07:58.98 I trained my entire adult life for this and now I had been told I didn't measure up.
01:07:58.98 --> 01:08:06.90 I felt like a mule kick to the gut. I heard rumblings that senior chief carry wanted to see my
01:08:06.90 --> 01:08:13.38 triedent taken away. Behind the scenes he was pushing for a triedent review board to determine my
01:08:13.38 --> 01:08:20.66 fate the months of infighting between us had been bad enough now he was trying to destroy my career.
01:08:20.66 --> 01:08:30.98 I was sick at the thought of losing my triedent over a single bad moment in a valley whose
01:08:30.98 --> 01:08:35.54 name nobody back home would ever know and whose location would not matter to anyone but a handful
01:08:35.54 --> 01:08:42.18 of men who had fought in it. Ensign Redmond had demonstrated a consistent pattern of bad decision
01:08:42.18 --> 01:08:47.86 making. I fought again about my screaming match with senior chief carry during the NATO exercise.
01:08:47.86 --> 01:08:52.58 When it ended what did I see in the eyes of what did I see in the eyes of my teammates?
01:08:53.62 --> 01:09:00.58 Embarrassment. This wasn't really about one moment in the valley was it Jay. I had to face that
01:09:00.58 --> 01:09:06.26 fact I rubbed my ankle temples. I felt like my head was going to explode from the pressure building
01:09:06.26 --> 01:09:10.82 inside of it my life was being destroyed and I had made myself vulnerable to these attacks with my
01:09:10.82 --> 01:09:16.90 own actions. If I was allowed to continue to operate stories of this deployment which circulate through
01:09:16.90 --> 01:09:22.26 the teams. If I go to my next platoon with my reputation and tatters who would follow my lead.
01:09:24.58 --> 01:09:30.74 Sitting neatly on the wooden crossbar on the floor beside my bed my holstered
01:09:30.74 --> 01:09:38.90 sick sour p226 sat well-oiled and cleaned. I leaned over and pulled it out.
01:09:38.90 --> 01:09:46.02 I knew around was already in the chamber but I drew back the slide and took a look to make sure.
01:09:46.74 --> 01:09:51.78 We called this a press check and it confirmed what I already knew. My gun was ready to go.
01:09:53.70 --> 01:10:00.66 As I held the pistol I fought of the great samurai warriors who if disgraced would commit ritual suicide.
01:10:02.42 --> 01:10:06.82 Part of me willed my hand to raise the sig to press it firmly to my temple.
01:10:06.82 --> 01:10:13.22 My life is over. There's nothing left but an honorable exit.
01:10:14.50 --> 01:10:18.18 I glanced over at the desk and saw a picture of my beautiful life, Erica.
01:10:18.98 --> 01:10:24.74 The image of her face riveted my attention. Her easy-going smile, her eyes, a light and lively,
01:10:24.74 --> 01:10:32.10 always quick to laugh and offer love and compassion. What would this do to her? After all she
01:10:32.10 --> 01:10:39.30 sacrificed for me, would my death snuff out the life of her gorgeous eyes? With the bullet
01:10:39.30 --> 01:10:45.62 I put in my temple. I'd leave her the burden of my failed career and it took it to a lifetime
01:10:45.62 --> 01:10:50.10 of grief. The kids would live under that cloud as well.
01:10:50.10 --> 01:11:06.98 You know it's interesting a lot of people who have not read my book or maybe they have read it
01:11:06.98 --> 01:11:18.66 in the gloss over this but they will wrongly assume that my injuries and that ambush and the
01:11:18.66 --> 01:11:25.06 aftermath of that ambush were the hardest thing I've ever been through. And I tell them absolutely
01:11:25.06 --> 01:11:32.50 not. By far that moment right there and that period of time in my life about a,
01:11:32.50 --> 01:11:38.66 that was about a four month period, maybe five months that journey to the bottom.
01:11:38.66 --> 01:11:50.26 And I was almost at rock bottom at that point and this is where the psychology of humans is an
01:11:50.26 --> 01:11:58.90 interesting thing because all of us have that little voice that lives inside of us. I call mine
01:11:58.90 --> 01:12:08.98 my demon and my demon has been my greatest pusher because he tells me what I can't do and he also at
01:12:08.98 --> 01:12:14.74 times can be the most dangerous thing out there because they will push you to do things or wrong,
01:12:14.74 --> 01:12:19.62 they will push you to do things and tell you you can't do things. And it was in that moment that I
01:12:19.62 --> 01:12:26.58 literally was listening to that that you know you will never recover. You know your career is over.
01:12:26.58 --> 01:12:32.02 There's no way you're going to come back from this. The guys are never going to follow you again.
01:12:32.02 --> 01:12:37.06 All these lies. These are lies that we tell ourselves and I think it's really important you know
01:12:37.06 --> 01:12:44.90 if there's anything about me. I tell people that I am an expert on overcoming adversity failure
01:12:44.90 --> 01:12:50.58 and crisis and it doesn't matter how bad things have been you always can recover and goes back
01:12:50.58 --> 01:12:56.26 to those three rules of leadership. You just once again go back to leading yourself and in
01:12:56.26 --> 01:13:06.34 that moment though I was so crushed, so crushed because I had convinced myself that I had done the right
01:13:06.34 --> 01:13:12.50 thing and unfortunately I still believe that and I just saw myself as a victim who had no way
01:13:12.50 --> 01:13:19.22 that I could recover and you know it's sad and you know you know that God moment that I glance
01:13:19.22 --> 01:13:24.26 to over because I don't think if I had made them a stake or wherever I was I'm not having pictures
01:13:24.26 --> 01:13:29.70 of my wife and kids right there I probably wouldn't have done it because I just felt so hopeless
01:13:30.42 --> 01:13:36.90 and then I was ashamed honestly for thinking that and thinking about the impact I would even
01:13:36.90 --> 01:13:42.58 them. So I'd love to say that was the catalyst of starting to climb out of that hole but I
01:13:42.58 --> 01:13:49.46 actually continued to spiral down over the next couple of months until finally you know my you know
01:13:49.46 --> 01:13:56.90 that moment occurred right after you know my judgment had been set upon me which really I was
01:13:56.90 --> 01:14:01.46 very fortunate because I should have been grateful because really what they could have done is said
01:14:01.46 --> 01:14:04.50 you're out of here you know we're sending you out of the teams you're going to go before
01:14:04.50 --> 01:14:09.14 try to review board and they didn't you know the CEO believed in me he said you know you've done
01:14:09.14 --> 01:14:14.58 a lot of great things you've had some amazing moments you've just you've got some flaws you've got some
01:14:14.58 --> 01:14:20.58 arrogant flaws and you definitely we need to work on your decision making
01:14:23.62 --> 01:14:30.02 leadership abilities so that's what they did it's it's you know when I was reading this part
01:14:33.06 --> 01:14:38.26 it's it's it's I don't I don't think you could have I don't think a human being I don't think you
01:14:38.26 --> 01:14:45.30 could explain I don't think will Shakespeare could explain to someone that's not in the teams
01:14:46.10 --> 01:14:53.86 what it feels like to be in the teams and to feel like maybe that's not going to be your life anymore
01:14:54.90 --> 01:15:00.82 that's rough man and I don't think I mean you did your best and like I said I don't think it's just
01:15:00.82 --> 01:15:05.94 too to explain and I mean I guess you do it because you explain listen you were at a point where
01:15:05.94 --> 01:15:12.26 if you couldn't be in the teams you didn't want to be alive that's where you were at right there
01:15:12.26 --> 01:15:18.18 and I guess that does explain it I think it might be hard for people to relate to but like for people
01:15:18.18 --> 01:15:26.18 like you and me that grew up literally whole adult life in the sealed teams I can't even imagine
01:15:26.18 --> 01:15:33.62 if at the in the in the in the in the highlight of that moment of being deployed in combat you just
01:15:33.62 --> 01:15:39.94 lost your your comrades and arms from your task unit and to be told okay you can't do this job anymore
01:15:41.14 --> 01:15:45.38 I mean like you said and again I think it's going to be hard for people to understand
01:15:46.50 --> 01:15:51.78 that it seems like you you would never want to you wouldn't want to live at all and then just
01:15:51.78 --> 01:15:57.78 to add this on to what you're saying and I say this every time that I talk about these kind of personal
01:15:57.78 --> 01:16:05.70 storms that people get into and I've just got to say this in case someone hasn't heard me say it before
01:16:06.34 --> 01:16:13.62 when you're in that storm it seems like it's goes forever in every direction anyone on the outside
01:16:13.62 --> 01:16:17.86 would anyone ten feet away from you would look at you and say oh yeah you you made some mistakes
01:16:17.86 --> 01:16:20.90 you need to you need to get back on the horse you need to get back out there here's what's going
01:16:20.90 --> 01:16:25.22 to help you get fixed here's what gets you back on but when we're it we every direction you look
01:16:25.22 --> 01:16:31.70 is black and you think you're not getting out and team guys don't play around either at all going
01:16:31.70 --> 01:16:37.06 back to the book so you decide okay I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stick it out you're on your way back
01:16:37.06 --> 01:16:42.02 I've made my way my way back to my hooch when I entered our living quarters I walked by our
01:16:42.02 --> 01:16:48.50 message board and saw notes crawled next to my name why don't you go ahead and kill yourself
01:16:48.50 --> 01:16:54.98 I stared at the words for I don't know how long the hallway was empty nobody had been standing
01:16:54.98 --> 01:17:03.62 around waiting to see my reaction that's team guys there's no mercy in a seal too there's not you
01:17:03.62 --> 01:17:09.94 know I've often thought about that and you know the deal we have incredibly dark humor so I
01:17:09.94 --> 01:17:17.06 often wonder what somebody just tried to lighten the mood and kind of shock me into hey dude come
01:17:17.06 --> 01:17:23.14 out of it you know go fix yourself I've always I've often wondered that or were they serious and
01:17:23.14 --> 01:17:28.42 just like dude you're a disgrace yeah we don't and and I know for a fact I mean there was a point
01:17:28.42 --> 01:17:34.18 right before we left on that deployment a couple weeks later where you know guys were being
01:17:34.18 --> 01:17:39.86 divvyed up and where they were going next so next well tune next leadership and they were asked you know
01:17:39.86 --> 01:17:47.46 who who do you want to work with you know who do you want to work under and and they unacquipically
01:17:47.46 --> 01:17:52.98 wrote we don't want to work with red so this was an additional blow that really kind of reinforced
01:17:52.98 --> 01:18:00.42 team and you you you you got some you got some work to do except I'll be honest I wasn't at that point
01:18:00.42 --> 01:18:03.78 yet you weren't there yeah I was still at rock bottom you know you talk about the storms
01:18:03.78 --> 01:18:10.98 I talk about life ambushes and this was a major life ambush one of the first major life
01:18:10.98 --> 01:18:19.86 ambushes I'd ever encountered and I literally was on the axe taking withering fire and I couldn't
01:18:19.86 --> 01:18:24.74 figure out how to get out of it and you were doing your best to return fire with your pistol yes
01:18:24.74 --> 01:18:29.78 and in this case I was going to return one round thinking that was going to fix things I'm going
01:18:29.78 --> 01:18:34.82 to I'm going to I'm right yeah I'm going to maintain this position right here and I'm going to win
01:18:34.82 --> 01:18:41.86 no actually you're not you need to you need to look around you need to maneuver so you do end up
01:18:41.86 --> 01:18:46.26 keeping your tried it because obviously there were some guys that that believed like you said
01:18:46.26 --> 01:18:53.78 believed in you and saw that you had the potential and actually sometimes people ask me what makes
01:18:53.78 --> 01:18:59.30 a guy get fired or not get fired and for me it's like almost 100% if the guy
01:19:00.26 --> 01:19:05.86 lacks humility they're going to get fired or if they if they if no one if I would see a guy that
01:19:05.86 --> 01:19:10.58 had no humility whatsoever and I didn't see a crack it'd be like okay this guy's a lost cause
01:19:10.58 --> 01:19:14.02 he's never going to listen to anyone you can't coach someone that lacks humility completely
01:19:14.66 --> 01:19:19.06 so or you can't help though they think they're going to sit on the axe and just get shot up
01:19:19.06 --> 01:19:24.42 that's the way it's going to be so somebody saw that hey we can get through to this guy you know he's a
01:19:24.42 --> 01:19:28.74 good team guy and more importantly to that point and this is a great leadership point and
01:19:28.74 --> 01:19:33.86 organizational point not only are they going to sit there and take those hits because they're
01:19:33.86 --> 01:19:38.58 too arrogant to be willing to move they're going to pull everybody else down with them and that's
01:19:38.58 --> 01:19:42.50 where it gets really dangerous I mean especially in our community where lives are on the line
01:19:42.50 --> 01:19:47.38 yeah I mean if they're unwilling to learn or humble themselves enough they're going to get somebody
01:19:47.38 --> 01:19:52.26 else killed and that was the big concern at that point and man I've got to give Kudos to my
01:19:52.26 --> 01:19:58.90 commanding officer who is a friend of this day he saved my career because I wasn't exhibiting humility
01:19:58.90 --> 01:20:03.22 you know I was fighting back I was I did the right thing I'm the victim here you know I'm just
01:20:03.22 --> 01:20:10.50 being thrown under the bus and thankfully he had enough faith in me I guess he had seen enough good
01:20:10.50 --> 01:20:17.46 that he said I think we can fix him yeah good man and one of the things that they do to fix you
01:20:17.46 --> 01:20:24.66 in the seal teams is send you to range your school I want to full vacation and I would say
01:20:24.66 --> 01:20:28.26 there's a small there's some people that go to range your school because they want to go to
01:20:28.26 --> 01:20:33.70 range your school right on but oftentimes in the seal teams range your school and I wouldn't even
01:20:33.70 --> 01:20:42.18 call it punishment but it's it's like a reeducation and that's definitely something that has always
01:20:42.18 --> 01:20:46.26 been and that's what they do with you okay they're going to they're going to send you to a really
01:20:46.26 --> 01:20:50.66 tough training school where it's not just a tough training school where you get weeded out you learn
01:20:50.66 --> 01:20:56.10 some tactics you learn to you learn leadership and I did not go to range your school but you know
01:20:56.10 --> 01:21:00.50 it's a great school everyone I know that the range is that I know are awesome guys so great school
01:21:00.50 --> 01:21:07.62 but oftentimes we use it in the seal teams maybe punishment is the wrong word in some cases I know
01:21:07.62 --> 01:21:13.30 it's been punishment occasionally a guy I want to go there but generally guys I mean generally
01:21:13.30 --> 01:21:18.10 guys are working so I'm not going to go to range your school you end up getting the range of
01:21:18.10 --> 01:21:23.62 school and here we go sick hungry burning with resentment because as you said you're not at this point
01:21:23.62 --> 01:21:31.70 you're still like oh this is this this is crap I don't deserve this yeah I was to say I was better
01:21:31.70 --> 01:21:38.50 is it understatement yeah burning with resentment I went into the first few days without my
01:21:38.50 --> 01:21:42.50 heart or mind engaged the first week of Ranger School is nothing but a gut check long days with
01:21:42.50 --> 01:21:46.26 minimal sleep exposure the elements in constant physical and mental evolutions to get those who
01:21:46.26 --> 01:21:52.02 don't want to be there to quit teamwork leadership within a circle of peers and decision making
01:21:52.02 --> 01:21:55.94 under stressful conditions where the objective of this first phase as a seal I should have
01:21:55.94 --> 01:22:00.26 represented my community in the best possible manner while by displaying leadership a commitment
01:22:00.26 --> 01:22:05.06 to teamwork and a willingness to overcome obstacles instead my actions showed me to be arrogant
01:22:05.06 --> 01:22:09.70 ill tempered and unwilling to work with others many soldiers falsely believe that seals are like
01:22:09.70 --> 01:22:16.02 that and my actions re-simply reinforced it I failed to represent my community as anything but
01:22:16.02 --> 01:22:22.74 that stereotype so you have this bad attitude you go out on a compass course you're pretty good at
01:22:22.74 --> 01:22:28.26 land nav you think you're gonna kick ass you don't kick ass you do a bad job the black
01:22:28.26 --> 01:22:34.18 hat to the Ranger instructors here we go the black hat's chuckled with laughter damn squid got lost
01:22:34.18 --> 01:22:38.34 we should have given you a boat swabby another growl not surprising seals know how to
01:22:38.34 --> 01:22:44.02 navigate anyways I failed at something I once took great pride in not so good without your Gucci
01:22:44.02 --> 01:22:50.66 gear are you another sneered I lost it all my pent up fury frothed out of me screw this course
01:22:50.66 --> 01:22:55.62 and screw you kiss my ass I walked up to my company instructor and told them I'm out of here I
01:22:55.62 --> 01:23:08.10 quit are you sure you want to do that without thinking I said yes I was reading this book and I was like
01:23:08.10 --> 01:23:17.94 day I was thinking damn I mean holy shit yeah talk about a total breakdown of emotional
01:23:17.94 --> 01:23:23.54 leadership I mean that's your reality I had died and and here's the problem with that I had
01:23:23.54 --> 01:23:32.34 allowed this to happen by not managing myself I had allowed this I was like a pressure cooker
01:23:32.34 --> 01:23:39.78 waiting to pop off and instead of managing it and recognizing it come to grips with it I didn't
01:23:39.78 --> 01:23:48.02 and it it just manifested itself in that moment where I failed the land nav course because of my own
01:23:48.02 --> 01:23:52.90 arrogance and then you know I allowed those Ranger instructors to get under my skin in that
01:23:52.90 --> 01:23:56.98 failure instead of immediately saying well hey no big deal I could have gone back and done it again
01:23:56.98 --> 01:24:01.78 like three days later because there I wasn't the only guy that failed there were other guys that failed
01:24:01.78 --> 01:24:10.10 but instead of that I instantly just it was one additional blow that I had sustained and being at
01:24:10.10 --> 01:24:15.38 this tipping point you know I allowed them to get under my skin and snapped and it is the only
01:24:15.38 --> 01:24:20.58 thing I have ever quit in my life that I have verbally quit I mean for all intense and purposes I
01:24:20.58 --> 01:24:27.86 rang the bell in that moment and so angry and frustrated and listened to that demon that said your
01:24:27.86 --> 01:24:33.30 career is over you will never recover from this you know this is the final straw you know you had
01:24:33.30 --> 01:24:39.30 an opportunity and you missed it man so you know nobody's ever going to follow you again and everyone
01:24:39.30 --> 01:24:45.30 screwed you over and put you in this point absolutely that's why you know victim victim mentality
01:24:46.90 --> 01:24:53.30 now this is a miracle this is a miracle this is a big it's god moment that and I people don't
01:24:53.30 --> 01:24:59.86 understand this this is a miracle the kernel in charge of Ranger School happens to be friends with
01:25:01.14 --> 01:25:06.50 Vince Peterson who we talked about earlier and that's not his real name but he's a legendary
01:25:07.78 --> 01:25:17.38 seal officer and a prior Vietnam Marine battle away city by the way just a just an awesome guy
01:25:17.38 --> 01:25:27.14 and for whatever reason miracle the kernel that's in charge of Ranger School is friends with
01:25:28.42 --> 01:25:33.94 with Captain Peterson and here we go go in back to the book you're sitting there talking to the
01:25:33.94 --> 01:25:39.14 kernel Vince Peterson was the greatest natural leader I'd ever known he had a knack of expressing
01:25:39.14 --> 01:25:44.98 where the team needed to go with just a few words he'd plant seeds like his men taking ownership of the
01:25:44.98 --> 01:25:51.22 plan then watched as everything went forward with the plan when the plan succeeded and it almost
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:57.70 always did he never took the credit he gave it to everyone else in retrospect I'm not proud that all
01:25:57.70 --> 01:26:02.10 I could manage was the fable and this goes back to something you talked about earlier in the book
01:26:02.10 --> 01:26:07.78 but at this point I was still unable to face the truth myself let alone admit it to the leader I
01:26:07.78 --> 01:26:15.86 respected above all others and so here you go your conversation with Captain Vince Peterson red
01:26:16.42 --> 01:26:23.06 do you really think Ranger School is punishment it is sir red have you ever thought that maybe
01:26:23.06 --> 01:26:30.02 there is an opportunity here sir you have a chance to learn something of value if you're willing to
01:26:30.02 --> 01:26:35.46 take it I didn't know what to say to that I'd not been trying to learn anything since I've
01:26:35.46 --> 01:26:41.94 Afghanistan I'd been trying to defend and justify you're getting ready to throw your career away red
01:26:42.98 --> 01:26:48.26 I'm not sure I have a career left sir red he said firmly what are you going to do if you get out
01:26:49.06 --> 01:26:53.70 if you come back you'll be out of the navy in a month how are you going to support your family
01:26:54.82 --> 01:27:01.14 he let that sink in I had no answer in state silent besides do you really want to go through your
01:27:01.14 --> 01:27:08.66 life having ended your career this way you can recover you control your destiny and your future
01:27:08.66 --> 01:27:14.50 you can earn back the respect of the guys if you give them something to respect if your actions demand
01:27:14.50 --> 01:27:23.22 respect I hadn't looked at it my situation from that angle red get back in that course finish it
01:27:23.22 --> 01:27:34.58 then come back with your head held high and show that you have the ability to lead that'll leave a mark
01:27:35.30 --> 01:27:42.58 yeah well and you know for people to understand I I didn't sleep a wink that night after I
01:27:42.58 --> 01:27:50.42 after I quit and I was so ashamed of what I had done and I was so convinced that there was no way I could
01:27:50.42 --> 01:28:00.34 undo it that I literally was just resigned to the fact that my career was over and when I went into that
01:28:00.34 --> 01:28:05.54 office I first spoke to the sergeant major in the sergeant major asked if I wanted to speak to anybody
01:28:05.54 --> 01:28:10.50 in the field team I don't know man I don't want to talk to anybody you know I am the failure I am
01:28:11.06 --> 01:28:17.94 broken and and then it was the kernel who asked me and I said the same thing so the mere fact
01:28:17.94 --> 01:28:24.34 and this is he didn't even offer he just started dialing so the and the mere fact he talked about
01:28:24.34 --> 01:28:31.62 this bait moment that that Vince Petersen happened to be at his phone and answered right then
01:28:32.50 --> 01:28:37.30 and and saying be on the phone and him to hand it to me and there was no way in hell I mean I had
01:28:37.30 --> 01:28:45.62 such respect for this this man there was no way I could say no and you know that conversation you
01:28:45.62 --> 01:28:51.38 know this is this is the highest levels of leadership to be able to quickly analyze the situation
01:28:51.38 --> 01:28:55.46 especially when you're working with people to understand you know okay this is where we're at
01:28:55.46 --> 01:29:00.34 this is the battlefield I'm looking at this is what I have to work with and this is what I need to
01:29:00.34 --> 01:29:05.78 do to move this person to where we're going to motivate and inspire them and I mean he did it flawlessly
01:29:05.78 --> 01:29:10.34 he'll exactly what to tell me he he told me both the good and the bad he gave me hope
01:29:10.34 --> 01:29:15.86 and he told me what happens if you don't which would be hopeless you know I will have you out of the
01:29:15.86 --> 01:29:20.74 military in less than a month and then you know I tell people that is the most succinct and powerful
01:29:20.74 --> 01:29:24.98 leadership advice I've ever been given you know people will follow you if you give them a reason to
01:29:24.98 --> 01:29:30.90 if you give them something to respect and that really is the foundation of you know the three
01:29:30.90 --> 01:29:37.22 rules of leadership I talk about lead yourself that's 80% of it you know leading others comes naturally and he was
01:29:37.22 --> 01:29:44.66 right because I left that office and the the funny thing about it though is I got off the phone
01:29:44.66 --> 01:29:52.10 and I asked the Colonel I said serve which put me back in class and he didn't miss a beat no
01:29:55.70 --> 01:30:02.58 he said instead you will go to the holding company and we will class you up with a new class a month later
01:30:02.58 --> 01:30:08.82 which is just what you needed you get rolled back for 30 days going back to the book I
01:30:08.82 --> 01:30:14.02 bent down and picked up the cigarette butt lying in the grass at my feet with a flick the butt
01:30:14.02 --> 01:30:19.78 spun into the garbage bag I'd been dragging across post with me so here you are a combat seal
01:30:19.78 --> 01:30:26.66 officer picking up cigarette butts 13 years and 13 years in as I filled my bag with litter the
01:30:26.66 --> 01:30:31.94 bit bitterness flared again I put 13 and I put in 13 and a half years I was a member of one of the
01:30:31.94 --> 01:30:36.82 most elite special operations units in modern history millions of dollars were spent preparing me
01:30:36.82 --> 01:30:41.14 training me out fitting me to handle the toughest battlefield tasks our nation can face and my
01:30:41.14 --> 01:30:49.62 own brothers have reduced me to this I stopped and thought about that statement where was the personal
01:30:49.62 --> 01:30:57.62 responsibility in it Vince Petersen's word came back to me you have an opportunity to learn here
01:30:57.62 --> 01:31:04.82 if you're willing to take it I served with good men whom I respected they turned their back on me
01:31:06.66 --> 01:31:15.30 or did they what did all this say about me a door suddenly opened in my mind the place it led to
01:31:15.30 --> 01:31:22.66 was a dark room that I had never entered inside I could see the truth about myself through the
01:31:22.66 --> 01:31:28.82 facade of lies I had built I stood at its threshold not really wanting to walk through
01:31:30.10 --> 01:31:35.14 Sunsu once said if you know your enemies and you know yourself you'll never be defeated
01:31:36.50 --> 01:31:42.82 I didn't know myself I was running blindly through life refusing to even acknowledge my weaknesses
01:31:44.02 --> 01:31:50.66 I have been an arrogant ass most of my career clearly I needed to come down to earth
01:31:50.66 --> 01:31:59.62 maybe trash detail did serve a purpose after all I guess I needed to mentally flatline before I
01:31:59.62 --> 01:32:07.54 could reconstruct myself for leadership I found another cigarette button flickered into my back the
01:32:07.54 --> 01:32:14.10 bitterness over being forced into this sort of work evaporated far from a humiliating burden it was
01:32:14.10 --> 01:32:20.90 giving me clarity I surely needed for years my attitude at hobbled relationships and endangered my
01:32:20.90 --> 01:32:26.02 career I suddenly recalled a moment years before I'd worked my tail off for months on a special
01:32:26.02 --> 01:32:30.98 project when I finished it I knew I was going to receive a significant award for the effort
01:32:30.98 --> 01:32:36.98 for whatever reason it got downgraded to a lesser award what did you do after you found out I
01:32:36.98 --> 01:32:42.50 thrown a temper tantrum I went off on one of our admin guys who had congratulated me after I
01:32:42.50 --> 01:32:47.30 received it instead of being grateful receiving any sort of acknowledgement I'd thrown the
01:32:47.30 --> 01:32:52.58 award at him I might as well have thrown it in the face of Captain Peterson who was my CEO at the time
01:32:53.78 --> 01:32:59.30 that incident stuck with my peers who witnessed it and for years after when I ran into one of them
01:32:59.30 --> 01:33:07.38 they'd remind me of it Jason Redmond Navy Achievement Medal Throar Vanguard of Leadership
01:33:07.38 --> 01:33:12.50 I can't say I looked forward to picking up trash the next morning but I didn't start the
01:33:12.50 --> 01:33:18.34 day despising what would come next I was ashamed that I'd fought so highly of myself that I saw
01:33:18.34 --> 01:33:24.74 myself as above picking up trash I realized that as a seal leader it was my responsibility to accept
01:33:24.74 --> 01:33:38.34 the example with everything I undertook there you go there you go it was you know so this is
01:33:38.34 --> 01:33:44.74 probably the point and I talked to a lot of people about this like I wish I could say that after I
01:33:44.74 --> 01:33:52.90 hung up the phone with Captain Peterson that I went back and was like you know yeah let's go let's
01:33:52.90 --> 01:33:59.38 do this you know let's crush this and instead I still was kind of finished I was on that slope
01:33:59.38 --> 01:34:06.34 down to crash that plane and I finally crashed that plane and hit really the bottom of the barrel
01:34:07.06 --> 01:34:11.14 and it was at that point that I really started to analyze myself and this something I talked to a
01:34:11.14 --> 01:34:16.90 lot of people about you know you truly have to know yourself you cannot because our weaknesses
01:34:16.90 --> 01:34:22.34 manifested themselves in the hardest times they don't come out in the good times and the good times
01:34:22.34 --> 01:34:27.30 there's no issues with it and the only way you could manage that you know it's to a mental leadership
01:34:27.30 --> 01:34:32.66 and emotional leadership at the highest level because in the hardest times and usually those
01:34:32.66 --> 01:34:38.82 in the times you've got to be managing the most is when it comes up and it was by really starting to
01:34:38.82 --> 01:34:44.26 rip myself apart and look at you know all these things that I had done and understanding
01:34:44.90 --> 01:34:49.38 oh yeah when I get into these situations I feel that you know that melt down with the
01:34:49.38 --> 01:34:55.54 Ranger instructors you know I felt that coming on I could have stopped it but I didn't I let it go
01:34:55.54 --> 01:35:01.46 you know they let the fuse and instead of tamping it you know out I let it burn and blow up
01:35:02.18 --> 01:35:07.70 so it was you know really it was these moments and this is probably the biggest thing that I can
01:35:07.70 --> 01:35:16.26 tell anybody out there it is never too late you can always come back so for for months I had convinced
01:35:16.26 --> 01:35:21.30 myself that I was a victim for months I had convinced myself there was no way to do this and for the
01:35:21.30 --> 01:35:26.82 first time when I finally looked at you know these are your weaknesses but all by the way man you
01:35:26.82 --> 01:35:32.26 got some amazing strengths and you know you need to figure out how to amplify these strengths minimize
01:35:32.26 --> 01:35:38.66 these weaknesses and and what an opportunity you have you are a seal that's in Ranger School that
01:35:38.66 --> 01:35:45.22 could crush this course set the example and come back every day is another opportunity you're going
01:35:45.22 --> 01:35:51.46 to screw up again and that's okay but you know so for the first time I saw hope standing at the
01:35:51.46 --> 01:35:58.02 front block bottom and looking up through this tunnel I saw a glimmer of light well what's what's
01:35:58.98 --> 01:36:07.86 when when you say that what I think about is what people get themselves into they box themselves
01:36:07.86 --> 01:36:14.10 into this scenario and it's exactly where you had boxed yourself into which was hey look this guy
01:36:14.10 --> 01:36:20.02 doesn't like me this guy's blaming me for that this these people have a bad attitude and you're
01:36:20.02 --> 01:36:26.10 and guess what other people you can't control and so you end up in a hopeless situation because I
01:36:26.10 --> 01:36:30.98 can't change this guy's attitude he's an asshole he doesn't like me he whatever we had to run in
01:36:30.98 --> 01:36:36.74 this person they don't trust me and I can't change that and so when you're in a situation where
01:36:36.74 --> 01:36:42.18 you can't change the situation at all because you don't have control over any of it well then guess what
01:36:42.18 --> 01:36:50.34 you're hopeless but the minute you look at yourself and you say wait a second I actually control
01:36:50.34 --> 01:36:58.18 everything that's going on right now everything people's perception of me is based on my behavior
01:36:58.18 --> 01:37:06.10 not theirs and that's what that's what I like to what Peter said you you control your destiny
01:37:06.10 --> 01:37:14.18 in your future that's that to me I highlighted that 98 times you control your destiny in your future
01:37:14.18 --> 01:37:19.78 and at this point in the book is where you saw and it took you picking up cigarette butts
01:37:20.66 --> 01:37:25.30 and it took you to that point where you say wait a second all these things that have happened to me
01:37:25.30 --> 01:37:31.14 I can get control of them and I can turn them in a better direction and yeah
01:37:31.14 --> 01:37:41.70 that's awesome and the journey began yeah that you kind of expanded a little bit more here
01:37:41.70 --> 01:37:46.18 I could not I could not change my decision but I should you're talking about this is when you're talking
01:37:46.18 --> 01:37:51.54 about you're reflecting now on what happened on your decision to go into the valley and Afghanistan
01:37:51.54 --> 01:37:56.66 that whole scenario that you got trouble for here's what you said about it I could not change my
01:37:56.66 --> 01:38:02.18 decision but I should have owned it in its aftermath I should have listened to those with more
01:38:02.18 --> 01:38:09.30 experience taking my lumps and moved forward that is how leaders grow I was so desperate to justify
01:38:09.30 --> 01:38:14.02 and defend my actions I lost sight of what to do of what I was there to do I was there to lead
01:38:14.02 --> 01:38:18.58 when necessary and to follow and call upon but above all else to accomplish the mission as part of
01:38:18.58 --> 01:38:24.66 the team instead in the aftermath I made it all about me and the defense of my ego
01:38:24.66 --> 01:38:31.22 again when you come into the office and say this wasn't my fault I was doing the right thing
01:38:31.22 --> 01:38:36.42 everyone that's looking at you is thinking he's he doesn't even see what he did wrong and that's
01:38:36.42 --> 01:38:40.50 where you talk about in this book you talk about the fact that one of the most
01:38:41.70 --> 01:38:46.10 one of the most horrible things on the battlefield is an arrogant young person that thinks
01:38:46.10 --> 01:38:51.22 there's not going to listen to anyone and you when you sit there and put up your defenses you're
01:38:51.22 --> 01:38:56.34 showing everyone that back to the book yes senior chief carry hated me we load each other but the
01:38:56.34 --> 01:39:00.74 truth he was a damn good operator in a firefight I would have wanted him there as a tactical leader
01:39:00.74 --> 01:39:06.18 in his own abrasive way he attempted to mentor me if I had put down my pride I would have seen it
01:39:06.18 --> 01:39:10.02 and I would have learned a lot from him that never happened I failed to manage our relationship
01:39:10.02 --> 01:39:15.94 and it poisoned the entire cartoon it also hurt my reputation with my teammates myself to see
01:39:15.94 --> 01:39:23.54 finally collapse to carry had not done this to me I done this all to myself I was being punished
01:39:23.54 --> 01:39:31.14 less for the decision I'd made and more for the way I'd fiercely refused to take responsibility for it
01:39:31.14 --> 01:39:36.26 the more I railed against those aligned against me the more I deserved to be punished
01:39:36.26 --> 01:39:47.22 I wasn't betrayed by my teammates I betrayed them with my selfishness it was time to grow up
01:39:46.82 --> 01:39:48.42 damn
01:39:53.14 --> 01:39:58.02 yeah it was exciting because it suddenly rangerschool suddenly became a new opportunity and
01:39:58.02 --> 01:40:03.38 really I set my sights on you know kind of interestingly enough I think all of us are super
01:40:03.38 --> 01:40:10.98 gold ribbon people and for the first time I saw an opportunity and and set a goal you know
01:40:10.98 --> 01:40:16.10 which is what I think all of us do so well at you know we we have a target to move to
01:40:16.10 --> 01:40:23.46 and now I have a path to go after it and that that path became I want to graduate the honor man
01:40:23.46 --> 01:40:30.74 of this course and set it set you know woke up the next morning firing up the guys around me
01:40:30.74 --> 01:40:35.14 and hey man we're getting ready to start up again it's going to be awesome let's go do this
01:40:35.70 --> 01:40:42.42 so yeah again I'm harping on this a little bit but just the fact that this book is so powerful
01:40:42.42 --> 01:40:49.30 because to to walk through that transition I'll tell you anybody that's red extreme ownership
01:40:49.30 --> 01:40:53.78 or anyone that listens to this podcast is going to be especially
01:40:55.46 --> 01:40:59.22 they're they're going to be having even deeper understanding because they they I talk about
01:40:59.22 --> 01:41:05.62 this all the time and to see you go down that path see where it leads and then be able to come
01:41:05.62 --> 01:41:14.02 back out be no comeback out is awesome but but it's so powerful to actually here from your perspective
01:41:14.02 --> 01:41:19.94 from someone that was in that exact position and doing those things to hear you saying it
01:41:20.74 --> 01:41:27.22 and be able to witness the turnaround it's uh it's powerful powerful stuff next morning I hit the
01:41:27.22 --> 01:41:30.66 ground running and never looked back the company I joined was full of strangers no matter I
01:41:30.66 --> 01:41:35.86 did everything full bore made sure I helped but made sure I help everyone in my squad whenever I could
01:41:35.86 --> 01:41:41.70 I was going to be the dis I was not going to be the disconnected selfish jerk I had been this
01:41:41.70 --> 01:41:50.74 go around my heart was fully invested and you kick ass in range of school you're not honor man
01:41:50.74 --> 01:41:55.54 because you find out that yeah I only find out at the very end that uh if you're rolled back
01:41:55.54 --> 01:42:00.90 you're not eligible but I didn't really well I was ranked at the top of my period of
01:42:00.90 --> 01:42:07.30 hours I mean all the instructors gave me about a man your dirge is crushing it and uh so no matter
01:42:07.30 --> 01:42:14.26 yeah it was a goal you know another great guy earned it and well deserved you end up back
01:42:14.26 --> 01:42:19.30 at the back of the teams you go back into a task unit and you're an assistant platoon commander now
01:42:19.30 --> 01:42:25.54 yeah again is this a reroll as a is it a re-reload as an assistant platoon commander or you
01:42:25.54 --> 01:42:32.66 still just super junior because you were a Steven Admiral guy no I had just made jg at this point
01:42:32.66 --> 01:42:36.90 so back then we still you know now they're kind of doing it differently a lot of us uh
01:42:36.90 --> 01:42:42.26 Steven Admiral guys did have the ability to do two pumps yeah they made me do two pumps yeah
01:42:42.26 --> 01:42:48.02 they wanted me to do two pumps and this is I mean for those who are not aware there was a little bit of
01:42:48.02 --> 01:42:56.82 uh impetus on me because they basically so as officers if you ever get a letter
01:42:56.82 --> 01:43:01.30 or a reprimand and you're record it effectively ends your career I mean if it that official letter
01:43:01.30 --> 01:43:04.58 goes into your record you're done you'll remember you won't make the next rank you're going to be
01:43:04.58 --> 01:43:10.26 out and they basically wrote this letter uh my outgoing CEO who was an afghanist and to my
01:43:10.26 --> 01:43:17.22 incoming CEO who was taken over the team and they basically said you made some mistakes and we
01:43:17.22 --> 01:43:22.66 questioned your tactical decision making and leadership abilities but we're going to give you a second
01:43:22.66 --> 01:43:28.34 chance so this letter and I was you know I was in the office with the CEO and he put it into
01:43:28.98 --> 01:43:35.38 his safe and basically said this will be burned or shredded at the end of the deployment
01:43:35.38 --> 01:43:39.94 if you show us you have the ability and if you don't it will go into your current and they had
01:43:39.94 --> 01:43:45.06 my officer record right there and they were like it will go right here into your record so and I
01:43:45.06 --> 01:43:50.18 think they knew the power of that also and it gave me additional momentum and I think this is
01:43:50.18 --> 01:43:54.74 important in leadership you know it's I mean same way we raise our kids there's got to be accountability
01:43:54.74 --> 01:43:58.82 you can't just tell somebody hey this what I want you to go out and do we have to let
01:43:58.82 --> 01:44:02.66 lay out the right and left limits and tell them this is where you're going to go and you have to
01:44:02.66 --> 01:44:07.86 have those things that hold you accountable so I don't know if I necessarily needed that I was
01:44:07.86 --> 01:44:14.18 pre-fired up on wanting to get back and set the example and redeem myself but I will say in the
01:44:14.18 --> 01:44:20.82 back of my mind I knew hey man you you got a you got a crush yeah that's it that's a I don't
01:44:20.82 --> 01:44:27.54 know if that's happens in all the military but in the seal teams there's there's a lot of
01:44:27.54 --> 01:44:32.98 letters that get shredded and part of it is like a cover your ass like when I was a commander
01:44:34.02 --> 01:44:40.18 a part of it's cover your ass because hey look you screwed up and if you screw up again and everyone
01:44:40.18 --> 01:44:44.66 knows that this is happened multiple times and you haven't been counseled about it I look like an idiot
01:44:44.66 --> 01:44:48.74 and not what I look like an idiot I am an idiot if I'm not documented that you screwed something
01:44:48.74 --> 01:44:54.26 up so I'm going to document this and make sure that you know I've got a documented but by the way
01:44:54.26 --> 01:44:57.62 I'm not trying to kill your career if you can turn around and you can get back on the path cool
01:44:57.62 --> 01:45:02.50 this thing's going in the shredder but here it is got to get some ways to go before this thing
01:45:02.50 --> 01:45:07.78 goes in that shredder yeah it's a pretty common thing in the seal teams not too common but um
01:45:07.78 --> 01:45:14.34 so you're in a task unit your assistant between commander and things are going good and you
01:45:14.34 --> 01:45:20.58 you were a lot more self aware and again you have to read the whole book to get all these details
01:45:20.58 --> 01:45:26.82 about that transition you were a lot more self aware and you started off as mobility commander
01:45:26.82 --> 01:45:32.18 and then eventually you started working with the assault team and here we go back to the book
01:45:32.18 --> 01:45:36.10 after that first successful mission on the assault team I had earned a spot in the mix
01:45:36.10 --> 01:45:40.34 and harmonized with the task units battle rhythm, arpotoons, rotated back and forth between
01:45:40.34 --> 01:45:46.18 running mobility or running the assault force the pace was intense and the mission started to blend
01:45:46.18 --> 01:45:53.46 together in a groundhog day sort of way I may have lost my way years ago but through God
01:45:53.46 --> 01:45:58.02 and a willingness to work hard and learn my strengths and weaknesses I had earned my way back
01:45:58.02 --> 01:46:09.62 into the brotherhood and you detail some some good missions some pretty hot missions you know
01:46:09.62 --> 01:46:13.86 you guys got some pretty good gun fights and you're getting towards the end of deployment
01:46:13.86 --> 01:46:19.14 and your TU commander he's he you have a little conversation with him and he says we're going to
01:46:19.14 --> 01:46:25.14 have you run as ground force commander on the next one for a second what this really meant failed
01:46:25.14 --> 01:46:31.22 to register really JP in the date at this point in the book JP is a guy he's your task unit commander
01:46:32.66 --> 01:46:36.74 JP nodded yeah I spoke to Eric and Paul and we all agree you're ready for it besides as
01:46:36.74 --> 01:46:42.74 a help get you up the speed to be a platoon commander at length I finally answered that's awesome
01:46:42.74 --> 01:46:48.02 thanks for the opportunity you earned it bro he turned to leave I had done it my career was back
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:53.30 on track it last I knew some in our community would always hate me from my mistakes but I had
01:46:53.30 --> 01:46:58.98 earned back the trust of the men I served and fought with since 2004 I'd been an officer within
01:46:58.98 --> 01:47:03.70 our community rank does not automatically make you a leader your character makes you a leader your
01:47:03.70 --> 01:47:10.58 actions make you a leader rank is almost irrelevant after years of self is focused on myself I'd
01:47:10.58 --> 01:47:17.22 finally understood what it meant to lead men of this caliber and what was required of a man in
01:47:17.22 --> 01:47:23.22 order to be part of this most elite of all fraternities the letter in the safe would be destroyed
01:47:23.22 --> 01:47:30.26 for an instant the horizon ahead held no boundaries and again I skipped this was not like an
01:47:30.26 --> 01:47:35.54 easy process man you worked your way right back up you started with small jobs you made some
01:47:35.54 --> 01:47:44.74 mistakes that you you know you you talk about the you late you laced the marine colonel and
01:47:44.74 --> 01:47:51.14 he was not happy yeah not happy so quick story you're doing deep confliction and you can't
01:47:51.14 --> 01:47:57.06 identify and so you escalate the deep confliction to a visible laser and then you know they
01:47:57.06 --> 01:48:02.50 realize that that both sides were friendly and you was a marine core colonel that you were
01:48:02.50 --> 01:48:08.18 lacing and he wasn't too happy about that and when you when when your commander brought you in
01:48:08.18 --> 01:48:12.58 and said hey what that'll happen you took ownership of it and said hey here's the mistakes I made
01:48:12.58 --> 01:48:22.10 instead of blaming everyone else so big big turning point and and I think this is an important point
01:48:22.10 --> 01:48:26.82 you know you you know I mean within our community it's pretty hard to turn around when you've
01:48:26.82 --> 01:48:32.02 made a major mistake like that I mean all of you guys get out we've had guys that have been sent to
01:48:32.02 --> 01:48:38.26 the fleet and some never come back and then some come back and redeem themselves but in a command some
01:48:38.26 --> 01:48:46.66 just get put into a ostracized position of low importance inside the seal teams right and it's like
01:48:46.66 --> 01:48:50.90 oh cool yep we yeah oh yeah you're stationed over there yep we know what you're doing and we know
01:48:50.90 --> 01:48:57.06 all about you and and we get that you still have your tried and and you're still considered a seal but
01:48:57.06 --> 01:49:01.14 you're not a team guy and we all know that yeah you would not be invited to go back to an
01:49:01.14 --> 01:49:05.94 operational billet you know you're relegated to training and all that you know other things so
01:49:05.94 --> 01:49:12.82 I mean it really is for people to understand I mean our community is driven by amazingly talented
01:49:12.82 --> 01:49:18.42 warriors and at the end of the day you know the leader they rely on the guys next to them and their
01:49:18.42 --> 01:49:22.66 leaders to make those good decisions so if you've made bad decisions I mean to be able to come back
01:49:22.66 --> 01:49:28.74 and them say okay you know you've shown us that we can trust you once again to lead and make the right
01:49:28.74 --> 01:49:36.10 decisions so it really I tell people there's a hardest road I've ever walked I mean when I got wounded
01:49:36.10 --> 01:49:46.34 I was like I got this yeah the the trust when broken is extremely hard to rebuild and I get asked
01:49:46.34 --> 01:49:50.82 a lot how do you build trust with people either whether it's been broken or whether you don't know
01:49:50.82 --> 01:49:55.30 them and it's very clear in the book and again this is why people should get the book the way that
01:49:55.30 --> 01:50:01.30 you're asking to commander and I'm trying to think of the alias because I know them to jp the way that
01:50:01.30 --> 01:50:04.98 you're asking to commander is very common to what a guy does he gives you a little bit of
01:50:04.98 --> 01:50:11.86 responsibility and let you let you earn a little bit of trust and then once you've earned a little bit
01:50:11.86 --> 01:50:15.46 of trust gives you a little bit more responsibility once you earned a little bit more trust and that
01:50:15.46 --> 01:50:20.42 continued going this is this is now a six month appointment plus a year long work up or whatever so
01:50:20.42 --> 01:50:24.26 keys been giving you a little bit of trust and you've been earning and earning and earning
01:50:24.26 --> 01:50:30.10 back your trust and you are digging out of a deficit right that's a lot harder so that is a lot harder
01:50:30.10 --> 01:50:34.90 when if you show up as a new guy you're like a zero right because and then you're going to get a
01:50:34.90 --> 01:50:38.74 little trust and then maybe you get to a a point two and then you get a little bit more
01:50:38.74 --> 01:50:44.66 responsibility and you get to a point four you were at like a negative nine and so you had to just
01:50:44.66 --> 01:50:51.14 you don't earn your way back to get to zero and then once you read zero then you had to build up and
01:50:51.14 --> 01:50:56.42 at this point in the book and you did some again I'm sorry I'm not going to go into everything but
01:50:56.42 --> 01:51:03.46 you know you had a pretty dynamic potentially horrible situation unfolding big gunfight going on
01:51:04.02 --> 01:51:09.22 some head counts not accounted for people and you took charge of the situation and that probably
01:51:09.22 --> 01:51:15.14 is what you know jumped you up a bunch of levels in people going okay you know what we can trust this
01:51:15.14 --> 01:51:20.98 guy and and and then you continued these to build that trust and up to the point where and I
01:51:20.98 --> 01:51:25.54 need to explain this because I didn't up to the point where the task unit commander said okay
01:51:26.34 --> 01:51:30.82 one of these next coming missions we're going to make you the ground force commander and what that
01:51:30.82 --> 01:51:35.62 means for civilians is that means you're in charge of everything you're going to go out you're going to be
01:51:35.62 --> 01:51:40.90 the this the main leader the senior leader not even the main they're going to be the senior leader the
01:51:40.90 --> 01:51:45.54 guy in charge of everything that's happening on the battlefield that's what the ground force commander is
01:51:45.54 --> 01:51:50.66 and you're now being it's ended up like you're being told look you've yeah we want you to be
01:51:50.66 --> 01:51:56.74 the ground force commander I want these upcoming operations and that is the ultimate trust for
01:51:56.74 --> 01:52:02.82 someone to give to a subordinate is hey I want you to go out and take my job that I would normally
01:52:02.82 --> 01:52:16.50 do you go do it so pretty amazing come back humbling yeah so you're almost at the end of deployment
01:52:16.50 --> 01:52:24.18 and like an an op comes up we were one week away yeah one week away we were packing up to get ready to go home
01:52:25.78 --> 01:52:34.58 note to self those last operations be careful first and last man the first mission is in the last ones
01:52:35.54 --> 01:52:41.70 getcha you and it's the mission comes down it's one of those missions where you guys are kind of like
01:52:41.70 --> 01:52:46.98 his probably isn't going to go down it's sketchy intel high visibility if it goes and you're thinking
01:52:46.98 --> 01:52:50.58 because we get a lot of those you know this is going to happen and you get used to
01:52:51.14 --> 01:52:55.22 getting all amped up and eventually you don't even get amped up anymore you continue with your daily
01:52:55.22 --> 01:53:00.58 routine go the gym workout whatever and this particular case you guys you you literally went to the gym
01:53:00.58 --> 01:53:05.62 you're working out like normal and I didn't think there was a chance and hell this mission was going to
01:53:05.62 --> 01:53:10.74 happen and some of the guys were looking at it but I just didn't think it was going to happen it was already
01:53:10.74 --> 01:53:18.98 late so we were outside really the window you know to really try and execute and a good manner
01:53:18.98 --> 01:53:23.62 in my opinion and then there were external things you know there's some classified factors to it
01:53:23.62 --> 01:53:27.86 that I don't talk about in the book where which were other some of the really big reasons why
01:53:27.86 --> 01:53:35.46 I did not think there was any chance this was going to happen but but it does and you guys roll
01:53:35.46 --> 01:53:46.02 out on a you know alchita target and definitely you guys had the intel that bad guys expected
01:53:46.02 --> 01:53:53.78 security team expect an enemy security team expected and and again like we would hear that a lot
01:53:53.78 --> 01:54:00.82 I mean it's not like it's not like oh this intel is 100% and you're not going to do anything different
01:54:00.82 --> 01:54:05.22 they tell you there's a security of enemy security team you're like okay check we've heard that
01:54:05.22 --> 01:54:11.86 27 times they've only been there however many times and so you always always expect it
01:54:11.86 --> 01:54:16.66 that they had there was a little more detailed information about this security detail that
01:54:16.66 --> 01:54:20.90 made it a little bit heavier than some of our regular missions I mean there were things that we knew
01:54:25.30 --> 01:54:30.02 you can't get into the day yeah I can't get into the details of a basic more solid into absolutely
01:54:30.02 --> 01:54:34.58 so it made it a little bit different and kind of raised our hackles a little more than normal
01:54:34.58 --> 01:54:40.18 but you know the process of the mission is the same I mean I know probably you up talked
01:54:40.18 --> 01:54:45.54 other people you know the guys that did the bin Laden raid the mechanics of that mission were the same
01:54:45.54 --> 01:54:51.06 it was just a level you know how we take down a target is pretty much the same regardless of where
01:54:51.06 --> 01:54:56.10 you go and it was the same for this case there were just some things that made us go maybe we should
01:54:56.10 --> 01:55:08.58 prepare a little more you guys roll on the target and the thing is get pretty intense pretty quick once
01:55:08.58 --> 01:55:12.98 you've once you've hit the target you've got it secured now we got some squirgers meaning some
01:55:12.98 --> 01:55:16.74 folks that we think have run away from the target building again I'm not going to go into the full
01:55:16.74 --> 01:55:21.14 detail of the mission which you did a beautiful job of explaining what this was like in the book and that's why
01:55:21.14 --> 01:55:29.70 people get the books they can read it but as we mentioned earlier this ends up in a firefight
01:55:29.70 --> 01:55:34.98 in your in it going back to the book I keyed my radio and called J.P. troops and contact troops
01:55:34.98 --> 01:55:39.94 and contact I have three wounded including me the machine guns were still blazing away at us
01:55:39.94 --> 01:55:45.70 and they walked their barrels right and left Chris crossing our positions with hundreds of 7.62
01:55:45.70 --> 01:55:50.10 millimeter bullets I recognize that if I didn't get a turner kit on what I thought was the
01:55:50.10 --> 01:55:55.62 stump of my left arm I was going to bleed out I looked back at Al and the rest of my team behind
01:55:55.62 --> 01:56:01.30 the tire right then Al Somme gets my feet and trying to run to join them I'll told me this later
01:56:01.30 --> 01:56:06.66 but I have no recollection of standing up after I was hit the first time the P.K.M gunner spotted me
01:56:06.66 --> 01:56:12.34 moving and laid on his trigger according to Al I'd only taken a step or two in my head whip sawed
01:56:12.34 --> 01:56:22.42 forward and my body spun around to the left I fell limp to the ground the team fought I'd been killed
01:56:22.42 --> 01:56:27.86 situation we were in and called in an immediate fire mission the AC 130 crew turned it down the first
01:56:27.86 --> 01:56:34.10 time two times before finally making all acknowledge that if anything happened to us it was Al's fault
01:56:34.10 --> 01:56:38.74 not the gun ships the first 25 millimeter shells hit the thick at behind the enemy
01:56:38.74 --> 01:56:44.90 I lay less than 50 feet from the enemy machine gun that had gaged me I drifted in and out of
01:56:44.90 --> 01:56:50.82 consciousness the entire time awake in a fog of confusion one minute out cold the next
01:56:51.78 --> 01:56:58.34 Al risked his life to save me during a low and fire he rose from behind the tire and charged over to me
01:56:58.34 --> 01:57:05.14 Sean laid down cover fire as Al ran into the teeth of that P.K.M bullets cracked and whitt whined around
01:57:05.14 --> 01:57:09.86 him but he reached me and dragged me back behind the tire where he put a turnic it on my mangled arm
01:57:10.90 --> 01:57:16.10 I remember nothing of this and I didn't know Al had even moved me to the tire until months after the
01:57:16.10 --> 01:57:23.86 fire fight the MetaVac bird arrived a few minutes later and the guys helped us aboard once we were
01:57:23.86 --> 01:57:29.22 airborne and out of harm's way the remainder of the task unit fell back to the original target compound
01:57:29.22 --> 01:57:35.14 to wait for extract but the fight was over the gun shot gun ship detected more movement in the thicket
01:57:35.14 --> 01:57:41.30 enough was enough Al called in 105 millimeter howitzer from the AC 130 in turn the thicket into a smoking
01:57:41.30 --> 01:57:46.50 crater months later when J.P. visited me at home I learned that the Alkai to commander had
01:57:46.50 --> 01:57:51.38 fled the house when he heard our birds coming at the start of the mission he left part of his
01:57:51.38 --> 01:57:58.02 personal security detail behind the fight a battle he had no stomach for himself and they died to the last
01:57:58.02 --> 01:58:04.34 man after inflicting three casualties on us months later another seal team ran the Alkai to
01:58:04.34 --> 01:58:22.98 commander to the ground and killed him justice served so that fire fight and again people should
01:58:22.98 --> 01:58:29.62 read the book to get the details of that fire fight but just reading about you wounded which I've
01:58:29.62 --> 01:58:36.98 covered that part and now you're up and running and get shot in the face and down everything
01:58:36.98 --> 01:58:44.02 guys think you're dead and you know I should have covered this with a little bit more detail but
01:58:44.02 --> 01:58:47.38 you know you're trying to make calls you're trying to let people know what's going on you're trying
01:58:47.38 --> 01:58:55.78 to decipher the situation because it was a rough situation that you guys were in and you end up you know
01:58:57.38 --> 01:59:05.54 get next-directed your boys took care of you they did I owe my life to those guys I mean they
01:59:05.54 --> 01:59:11.94 fought back that gunship overhead you know for special operations squadron I owe my life to those
01:59:11.94 --> 01:59:17.54 guys that was the closest fire mission ever in the Iraq war we were well well they wouldn't
01:59:17.54 --> 01:59:23.46 bring in that mission because we were we were literally within any danger growth close programmer
01:59:23.46 --> 01:59:29.78 there were the machine guns that had me pinned down we're about 45 feet 50 feet away so
01:59:30.74 --> 01:59:37.86 Al did an amazing job I mean this was his third combat deployment you know experience jac experience
01:59:37.86 --> 01:59:43.54 team leader and you know really I mean he hung it all out there exposing himself to get me
01:59:43.54 --> 01:59:49.14 say my life with my turn a kid and the rest of the guys you know fought amazingly to get us
01:59:49.14 --> 01:59:56.58 out of there and get off the axe and survive and yeah I wanted Al to get a navy cross
01:59:57.78 --> 02:00:02.50 they they downgraded it to a silver star to this day you know I'll tell anyone he deserved
02:00:02.50 --> 02:00:09.86 uh navy cross but all those guys did an amazing job I owe my life my life to them and the gunship
02:00:10.98 --> 02:00:15.86 it and obviously you know in the beginning of the book you know the thought that I'd lost my
02:00:15.86 --> 02:00:21.54 arm and what happened is actually I guess my arm was pinned under me so when I reached for it I
02:00:21.54 --> 02:00:27.30 couldn't feel it and you know it just stunned all my nerves there was an earth damage too right yeah yeah
02:00:27.30 --> 02:00:33.22 so when when uh and this is kind of an interesting point that I talked to people about and
02:00:33.22 --> 02:00:39.62 something I'm speaking on all the time now this idea of surviving so having trained in a career
02:00:39.62 --> 02:00:46.58 we we where we learn how to execute ruthless and devastating violence of action in an ambush
02:00:46.58 --> 02:00:53.78 to crush the enemy and destroy the enemy in that kibblesome on the axe and to now be on the
02:00:53.78 --> 02:00:59.54 flip side of that coin and be in a very well executed ambush I mean they had us it was an L-A-A-M-B-O-S
02:00:59.54 --> 02:01:07.86 they had us caught very good crossfire you know and just sheer will for us to fight and at least
02:01:07.86 --> 02:01:15.30 and push back enough that it gave us a window and and by the and sheer we were sheer lock that
02:01:15.30 --> 02:01:20.90 there happened to be that tractor tire back there at least one point of cover because beyond that there
02:01:20.90 --> 02:01:29.78 was nothing but thousands of yards of open Iraqi desert but to be in that ambush in that devastating
02:01:29.78 --> 02:01:37.94 and withering crossfire I stepped out of that ambush into another ambush and the next ambush was
02:01:37.94 --> 02:01:44.02 what I call a life ambush suddenly here I was I'd been on this amazing journey of failure
02:01:44.02 --> 02:01:53.30 growth understanding gaining experience in wisdom and redemption and you know career back on track
02:01:53.94 --> 02:02:01.38 getting ready to screen and go over to the next level seal team was my goal when I came back
02:02:01.38 --> 02:02:07.38 from that deployment I was doing that and suddenly to find myself laying in a hospital bed
02:02:08.42 --> 02:02:13.06 so weak I needed nurses to help me go to the bathroom from the amount of blood loss I had
02:02:13.06 --> 02:02:17.46 the very first thing I woke to was the doctors telling me most likely that we're gonna have to
02:02:17.46 --> 02:02:23.78 empty tape my arm I had no use of my hand I had not seen myself in the mirror my face was totally
02:02:23.78 --> 02:02:32.26 blown apart I had lost my nose cheekbone my eye my bitten the bullet traveled the bullet hit me
02:02:32.26 --> 02:02:36.90 right in front of the ear traveled through my face and exit at the right side of my nose so it took off
02:02:36.90 --> 02:02:44.02 most of my nose took out most of my cheekbone it vaporized my orbital floor so my eye actually
02:02:44.02 --> 02:02:50.90 dropped down into the newfound hole in my face so at damage my eye muscles I broke all the bones
02:02:50.90 --> 02:02:58.42 above my eye it shattered my jaw broke my jaw to my chin so I had not seen myself laying in the
02:02:58.42 --> 02:03:04.34 hospital bed and I'll be honest I was I wasn't ready to look at myself I knew I had tubes coming
02:03:04.34 --> 02:03:09.38 out of everywhere I was tricked I was wired shot at a stomach tube that's how they were feeding me so I
02:03:09.38 --> 02:03:18.34 stepped into this next ambush I was you know with this thought of where do I go from here and
02:03:20.02 --> 02:03:24.50 I'll be honest for the first couple of days I kind of struggled and I think this is natural so
02:03:24.50 --> 02:03:31.62 we talk about this idea being pinned down on the X and how we have to survive in whether it's a real
02:03:31.62 --> 02:03:35.94 world ambush or it's a life ambush for anyone that's out there that's encountered some sort of
02:03:35.94 --> 02:03:40.42 devastating event and I classify life ambushes an event that'll forever leave physical
02:03:40.42 --> 02:03:46.26 mental or emotional scars on you you have to get off the X so I'm laying there in this hospital bed
02:03:46.26 --> 02:03:52.42 and I'm like kicking myself I'm like god man what if I you do the things that humans do when
02:03:52.42 --> 02:03:57.62 bad things happen we start to think well what if I had done this or what if I had done that or
02:03:57.62 --> 02:04:05.14 and you know what if I could go back and change this fact and I did that for probably I don't know
02:04:05.14 --> 02:04:10.58 36 hours after I got to Bethesda you know just kind of lost in my mind thinking about it and at one
02:04:10.58 --> 02:04:17.86 point I just said stop you can't go back and change the past man what's happens happen the only thing
02:04:17.86 --> 02:04:24.02 you can do is shape the future and I thought back to that journey that I had been on from ground zero
02:04:24.02 --> 02:04:31.86 from that broken man in Afghanistan ready to kill myself to where I had come and I said dude
02:04:32.58 --> 02:04:39.30 the only thing you can do from here is shape the future so get off the X and go and I never
02:04:39.30 --> 02:04:45.62 look back from that point and I tell people that you know you have to push yourself into those
02:04:45.62 --> 02:04:50.58 zones and discomfort so that you can handle these hard situations when they come because if you've
02:04:50.58 --> 02:04:55.86 never forge yourself if you've never been put into these areas it discomfort you're going to be
02:04:55.86 --> 02:05:01.22 crushed when they come because you're not going to be ready I was so ready for that moment when it
02:05:01.22 --> 02:05:05.86 came I mean you know took me about 36 hours after I got home to figure it out but still that's
02:05:05.86 --> 02:05:13.86 pretty quick for a devastating injury like that and I never looked back you're your in Bethesda and just
02:05:13.86 --> 02:05:19.62 just to kind of give a little bit of detail around that you got some doctor named female doctor named
02:05:19.62 --> 02:05:25.78 Dr. Malard and here we go back to the book kind of she's about to list your kind of your situation
02:05:25.78 --> 02:05:31.14 that you're in with energetic bluntness she laid out the extent to my wounds the machine gun bullet
02:05:31.14 --> 02:05:36.34 entered just in front of my right ear it shattered my job vaporized my right or burrow floor destroyed
02:05:36.34 --> 02:05:41.06 my cheek and exit through my nose I'd suffered nerve damage as well virtually nothing was left
02:05:41.06 --> 02:05:46.18 to my cheek bone or ocular floor bones on the right side of my face she and her team was amazed
02:05:46.18 --> 02:05:51.46 I didn't suffer greater I damage so that was a blessing my nose was almost completely destroyed and
02:05:51.46 --> 02:05:56.02 we need a full reconstruction they would need to repair my shattered jaw implant a titanium
02:05:56.02 --> 02:06:00.90 plate to replace the ocular floor and would have to repair the damage to the rest of my facial
02:06:00.90 --> 02:06:06.02 bones on the right side I was still under the impression they could fix me right up and get me back
02:06:06.02 --> 02:06:13.06 into the teams not not now I was not so sure and you at this point your jaw's wires shut in your
02:06:13.06 --> 02:06:16.90 tricks so you can't talk so you write out a note how many weeks are we looking at here dock
02:06:17.46 --> 02:06:28.02 weeks she said surprised no Jay we're talking years a few years at least years it didn't even
02:06:28.02 --> 02:06:33.70 sink in at first there will be progressive surgeries each one will need to be fully healed before we
02:06:33.70 --> 02:06:38.50 can move on to the next one she went on to explain that there was no road map for the extent of the
02:06:38.50 --> 02:06:45.38 extent and nature of my wounds my case was highly complex and I would require extensive bone
02:06:45.38 --> 02:06:51.22 and skin grafts in the years ahead after she left I struggled to keep my spirits up
02:06:52.66 --> 02:07:03.38 this was news I did not want to hear yeah you know and this is an interesting fact you know
02:07:03.38 --> 02:07:08.58 I talked to a lot of other team guys about this I think a lot of us we do a really good job in the
02:07:08.58 --> 02:07:13.30 seal teams and you know I'd like to assume other military units do the same we do a really good
02:07:13.30 --> 02:07:19.06 job of preparing guys if they get killed you know page two we make sure they're all taken care of
02:07:20.74 --> 02:07:26.66 I don't think any of us ever give much thought I should if I was severely wounded I think most of us
02:07:26.66 --> 02:07:32.82 think one side of the coin is you know it'll be merely a flesh wound you know and we'll walk away
02:07:32.82 --> 02:07:38.50 and we'll get back and then the other side of the coin is I'll be killed and I was good with either of
02:07:38.50 --> 02:07:42.66 those side you know it's just kind of resigned myself to that fact so it was a whole another thing
02:07:43.46 --> 02:07:49.30 to be severely wounded and be faced with this fact that hey you may be forever disabled
02:07:52.90 --> 02:07:58.18 and it was tough for you and here's you run into this situation going back to the book one afternoon
02:07:58.18 --> 02:08:02.26 two family members came to visit us Erica took the opportunity to step out and grab some lunch for
02:08:02.26 --> 02:08:07.46 herself I talked with them for a bit which left which quickly fatigued me I started drift off before
02:08:07.46 --> 02:08:12.58 I even realized it while I was dosing I heard them whispering to each other I only got fragments of
02:08:12.58 --> 02:08:18.82 the conversation but it was enough they were full of pity for me when Erica returned and my
02:08:18.82 --> 02:08:24.50 relatives departed I wrote down all that had happened recounting it sent me into a fury again I
02:08:24.50 --> 02:08:30.02 tore off the sheet of paper and handed it to her then I thought for a minute and added never again
02:08:30.02 --> 02:08:36.02 never again would someone seal feel sorry for me I fought for my country and I'll fight to regain
02:08:36.02 --> 02:08:41.38 my health so I will ultimately be able to return to our nation's battlefields I was not here
02:08:41.38 --> 02:08:47.06 for sympathy I was here to recover to be a leader to set an example of mental fortitude it would be
02:08:47.06 --> 02:08:52.50 all too easy to give up into despair but I refused there were men and women in this complex who are
02:08:52.50 --> 02:08:58.90 far more badly wounded than I was missing limbs burned suffering brain trauma or eyesight loss
02:08:58.90 --> 02:09:04.58 I would be grateful for what I had determined to succeed in the days ahead and when you use these
02:09:04.58 --> 02:09:09.78 principles I learned over the last two years to guide me forward I wrote a note to all my visitors
02:09:09.78 --> 02:09:15.70 and asked Erica to hang it up on the door and here's what the note said attention to all who
02:09:15.70 --> 02:09:23.22 enter here if you are coming into this room with sorrow or to feel sorry for my wounds go elsewhere
02:09:23.22 --> 02:09:30.74 the wounds I received I got in a job I love doing it for people I love supporting the freedom of
02:09:30.74 --> 02:09:37.94 a country I deeply love I'm incredibly tough and will make a full recovery what is full
02:09:38.58 --> 02:09:46.98 that is the absolute utmost physically my body has the ability to recover then I will push that
02:09:46.98 --> 02:09:54.82 about 20% further through sheer mental tenacity this room you are about to enter is a room of fun
02:09:54.82 --> 02:10:04.58 optimism and intense rapid regrowth if you are not prepared for that go elsewhere from the management
02:10:08.58 --> 02:10:15.70 and awesome I mean in that picture you got sent to me by someone and eventually it got sent to everyone
02:10:15.70 --> 02:10:22.74 by everyone so it was a viral picture of that sign on your door that you eventually put in bigger
02:10:22.74 --> 02:10:33.78 writing to make sure everyone saw it you eventually you do get home and again you know it
02:10:33.78 --> 02:10:40.98 was I when I want to make a really important point about this because that that was really
02:10:40.98 --> 02:10:48.98 a learning point for me or it was a jump point and it comes back to what we talked about earlier
02:10:48.98 --> 02:10:54.02 in the beginning a little bit of the social leadership idea who you surround yourself with and in
02:10:54.02 --> 02:10:59.86 that moment I had individuals to want to express pity and I realized how dangerous that was
02:10:59.86 --> 02:11:05.46 because if I listened too long to people express that it would be easy to accept that to accept
02:11:05.46 --> 02:11:11.22 this victim mentality and I've walked that road before and I was like no way am I going to allow
02:11:11.22 --> 02:11:16.34 that to happen it is a choice and that's what people need to understand you know having a positive
02:11:16.74 --> 02:11:23.70 attitude on how you handle the situations you're in is a choice and the more you accept positivity
02:11:23.70 --> 02:11:29.22 and drive it forward the more you actually start to believe it and it will create momentum and that's
02:11:29.22 --> 02:11:34.90 really what happened with that sign I said I will not allow that to happen again no one will come
02:11:34.90 --> 02:11:43.86 in here and be sad because I refuse I will not allow it and you never know the impact of the decision
02:11:43.86 --> 02:11:48.26 that you're going to make you you never know how even though deep down inside you were like you
02:11:48.26 --> 02:11:53.06 know holy shit how do I get out of this situation but you project that positivity who you can
02:11:53.06 --> 02:11:58.82 bring with you and bring up and how much you can leave an impact of the last of lifetime
02:11:58.82 --> 02:12:05.46 that sign has gone on to help hundreds of thousands of people I've had people write me
02:12:06.02 --> 02:12:11.62 that have had cancer I've had people that have written me that have had major horrific accidents
02:12:12.18 --> 02:12:18.42 I didn't keep the sign I had it framed and it hangs in the wounded ward at Walter Reed
02:12:18.42 --> 02:12:23.86 and the bottom of the sign is like rub clean now and I'm told that all these wounded warriors
02:12:23.86 --> 02:12:28.98 whenever they go to a surgery they go by and they rub it and it just it continues to have this
02:12:28.98 --> 02:12:35.70 impact Secretary Gates wrote about the sign in his book Michelle Obama's book just came out she wrote
02:12:35.70 --> 02:12:44.26 about the sign and what the impact is so one moment of saying I'm not going to allow someone else to
02:12:44.26 --> 02:12:50.98 drive my thinking makes all the difference and I tell so many people that it is a choice it is a choice
02:12:50.98 --> 02:12:55.78 you can choose to be a victim and feel sorry for yourself or you can choose to be a vector and
02:12:55.78 --> 02:13:01.94 drive for it even if you don't believe it in the moment it doesn't matter you know say it
02:13:01.94 --> 02:13:07.62 live it and start driving forward and that belief will catch fire within you and everybody else
02:13:07.62 --> 02:13:16.82 around you know doubt about it man and and the unfortunate opposite that is when you start
02:13:16.82 --> 02:13:21.46 allowing yourself to be negative and you start listening to people that want to be negative and be
02:13:21.46 --> 02:13:28.02 and drag you down you can easily had to head yourself on that direction as well so when you make
02:13:28.02 --> 02:13:33.30 choice and make a decision on which one of those two directions you want to move in up or down
02:13:35.30 --> 02:13:43.54 we recommend you move up move forward yeah absolutely later that spring Eric and I went out to eat
02:13:43.54 --> 02:13:50.02 at a local outback steak house to celebrate the unwiring of my jaw it been almost seven months
02:13:50.02 --> 02:13:55.46 since I've been able to chew food I was still underway and confined to a wheelchair because of
02:13:55.46 --> 02:14:01.54 the grass but we both needed to night out I just you know I when I was reading this book I was like
02:14:01.54 --> 02:14:07.46 eating something whatever you know and it's just one of those things that we all take for granted
02:14:07.46 --> 02:14:13.70 every single day and you know about how that multiple prisoners of war on this podcast and
02:14:14.66 --> 02:14:18.90 you know they're eating a ball of rice once a day or ball of rice twice a day that has chips
02:14:18.90 --> 02:14:25.54 a wood in it for three years for six years and here here you are you know you're not in the
02:14:25.54 --> 02:14:33.30 prisoner of war but something as simple as eating a steak and that really like hit me hard
02:14:33.30 --> 02:14:39.38 because as you know I take steaks very seriously and to think that like for seven months no steak
02:14:40.58 --> 02:14:45.94 and the daily things and and and that always gets me thinking about the daily things that when I
02:14:45.94 --> 02:14:52.50 talk to my friends that have been wounded it's like it's the daily everyday things and as matter
02:14:52.50 --> 02:14:58.90 fact when we had Jim Web on and he was talking about one of his friends that have been wounded
02:14:58.90 --> 02:15:05.30 in Vietnam and he's like that's the daily courage like that guy was courageous in Vietnam but he's
02:15:05.30 --> 02:15:10.82 courageous every single day takes him X amount of time to get up out of bed takes him X amount of time
02:15:10.82 --> 02:15:14.74 to get his prosthetics to take some X amount of time to do normal functions that people can
02:15:14.74 --> 02:15:18.98 normally do easily he's got a struggle with them all he does in every single day without complaining
02:15:19.86 --> 02:15:23.94 daily courage and so just thinking about you in that situation man
02:15:23.94 --> 02:15:31.94 awesome I flew to Chicago almost once a month in preparation for my first surgery with Dr.
02:15:31.94 --> 02:15:36.74 Walton which he'd scheduled for July the airports and their crowds continued to be a torment
02:15:36.74 --> 02:15:41.30 little kids pointed at me and called to their mothers to look at me too people refused to talk to me
02:15:42.02 --> 02:15:46.66 they'd act ashamed or embarrassed or they'd set expressions of pity on their faces internally
02:15:46.66 --> 02:15:53.22 I raged at them are these the people I sacrificed for coming back from a ship of coming back from
02:15:53.22 --> 02:15:58.18 Chicago on one trip I just broke everyone who stared at me I treated with a sudden boo
02:15:59.70 --> 02:16:03.94 by the end of the trip though I realized I needed to do something different or the bitterness would
02:16:03.94 --> 02:16:08.18 eat me alive the game me a thought I came up with an idea I went online and designed a couple
02:16:08.18 --> 02:16:13.22 t-shirts the first one said stop staring I got shot by a machine gun it would have killed you
02:16:14.02 --> 02:16:18.66 I put an American flag on the back and called it wounded wear so
02:16:18.66 --> 02:16:24.90 are you still making wounded wear shirts so when it wears on pause for right now but it will be
02:16:24.90 --> 02:16:32.02 coming back we've got some work we're getting things online in 2019 but yeah a lot of people have
02:16:32.02 --> 02:16:39.62 asked me when it will come back it will be back I assure you yeah so this podcast is eternal so
02:16:39.62 --> 02:16:45.14 most likely when people are listening to this it is live you get it you get your wounded wear t-shirt
02:16:45.14 --> 02:16:53.22 that's right yeah you were talking about that that sign and that sign got so much attention and
02:16:53.22 --> 02:17:00.18 and was so so impactful to so many people you ended up going the overall office you ended up meeting
02:17:00.18 --> 02:17:07.62 president Bush with your family and then you ended up coming back to the White House again and we're
02:17:07.62 --> 02:17:17.06 going back to the book I went to Mike Montsour's metal vowner ceremony in the White House that
02:17:17.06 --> 02:17:23.54 April Mike was a fellow seal who had jumped on a hand grenade thrown onto a rooftop he had
02:17:26.74 --> 02:17:33.54 and saved two of his teammates in a firefighting in Ramadi he shielded his brothers with his own
02:17:33.54 --> 02:17:41.38 body and paid the ultimate price for that devotion it was deeply moving to be there to see Mike's
02:17:41.38 --> 02:17:48.10 family receive his poshmas metal of honor but while I was there I met another seal named Ryan Job
02:17:49.22 --> 02:17:55.94 he'd been part of the team three and had served with legendary sniper Chris Kyle and I rack
02:17:55.94 --> 02:18:02.58 during the 2006 campaign Ryan had been a mark 48 machine gunner for the team and during a firefight
02:18:02.58 --> 02:18:07.30 that spring of bullet head struck his weapon then hit him in the face destroying his right eye
02:18:08.50 --> 02:18:14.18 he survived and reached Bethesda much as I would a year later but nerve damage cost him as vision
02:18:14.74 --> 02:18:20.50 it is left eye the prospect of spending the rest of his life blind had to have been terrifying
02:18:21.54 --> 02:18:27.22 though he never showed it instead he announced that if he had to be blind he would be the best
02:18:27.22 --> 02:18:35.54 damn blind man there was so that's where I met you for the first time obviously uh
02:18:35.54 --> 02:18:41.54 Mikey and Ryan and Chris were all with me and task unit bruiser and you came out for the
02:18:41.54 --> 02:18:50.18 for the metal of honor ceremony for Mikey and I actually remember looking at you guys you know
02:18:50.18 --> 02:18:54.74 looking at you guys talking to each other and I actually thought I had pictures of it but I didn't
02:18:54.74 --> 02:19:01.22 I I thought I had pictures of YouTube talking but I didn't have any pictures but it was it was
02:19:02.42 --> 02:19:07.38 crazy to sit there and look at both you guys that have been you know both in shot unfortunately
02:19:07.38 --> 02:19:13.94 Ryan you know he lost vision and both eyes which obviously could have happened to you very easily
02:19:13.94 --> 02:19:20.82 and thank god you know it didn't um and you guys kind of you know I guess when you have
02:19:20.82 --> 02:19:26.18 getting shot in the head and calm and you guys kind of became bros and uh who continue on here
02:19:26.18 --> 02:19:29.62 Ryan and I bumped into each other on multiple occasions over the next several months
02:19:29.62 --> 02:19:34.18 on one of the occasions Ryan had come out to the East Coast seal teams for a wounded warrior
02:19:34.18 --> 02:19:41.14 uh benevolent organization conference as we made small talk and met different people I Ryan
02:19:41.14 --> 02:19:46.42 and another seal who had been shot in the eye were joking around and came up with the idea for a club
02:19:46.42 --> 02:19:52.90 for seals who had been shot in the head it was a very small club we decided to call the club
02:19:52.90 --> 02:20:00.74 shit seals hit in the head we unanimously voted on our motto this club sucks
02:20:06.18 --> 02:20:14.50 so yeah just just pretty awesome and that's pretty much you know that's definitely Ryan
02:20:14.50 --> 02:20:21.70 uh Backel's Job's attitude was he was just gonna have an awesome time all the time regardless
02:20:21.70 --> 02:20:28.02 what situation he was in he was gonna he was gonna he was gonna get after it and um yeah what's
02:20:28.02 --> 02:20:33.46 called to you guys meet yeah Ryan was awesome and you know he was ahead uh it was interesting because
02:20:33.46 --> 02:20:38.82 the reconstruction process that they were doing with me was the same they were doing with Ryan
02:20:38.82 --> 02:20:43.86 and obviously I was blessed to keep my vision although there were fixing things with this right
02:20:43.86 --> 02:20:50.34 eye so often I'd call him and I'd be like hey you know you had this done how to go you know
02:20:50.34 --> 02:20:54.50 what did you do do you have any recommendations like anything you know you go to the people
02:20:54.50 --> 02:20:59.22 who have experience so Ryan and I got close through that yeah just kind of learning from him
02:21:00.02 --> 02:21:05.46 well one of the this this was another bit of a of a surprise to me again this is the kind of thing
02:21:05.46 --> 02:21:11.06 that I never had to think about but here you go go back to book in the months that followed
02:21:11.06 --> 02:21:15.94 I knew that I was in for the long game the slog through surgeries and setbacks continue and again
02:21:15.94 --> 02:21:25.38 you got to read this book to realize the absolute just medical uh medical trauma that you're going
02:21:25.38 --> 02:21:30.74 through day in day out and this really drove it home to me I called it medical bud there you go
02:21:30.74 --> 02:21:36.10 it's really what it was medical buds and here's here's one thing that just hit me like a ton of
02:21:36.10 --> 02:21:42.58 bricks by the summer of 2009 I was starting to run low on the available patches of skin for
02:21:42.58 --> 02:21:50.42 grafting my body was rope with scars from surgical sites and over a dozen graphs that to me
02:21:50.42 --> 02:21:58.34 I'm thinking myself I mean you're running out of skin to graft to do to do damage repair to your face
02:21:58.34 --> 02:22:07.06 what is that process like so a lot of times they harvest the skin from you know your thighs and
02:22:07.06 --> 02:22:12.34 areas and and it wasn't that I was just running out of skin they were running on the skin because I've
02:22:12.34 --> 02:22:19.94 got quite a few tattoos so my back is totally tattooed you know you know top my arms so that's what
02:22:19.94 --> 02:22:24.58 the problem was becoming putting tattooed skin on other parts of your body is no big deal they
02:22:24.58 --> 02:22:29.38 could have cut that in a second but obviously they were like you know we did I did not want to
02:22:29.38 --> 02:22:37.14 put tattooed skin on my face so that's where we were starting to run into issues and this really
02:22:37.14 --> 02:22:42.74 is something that a lot of people don't understand with with battlefield injuries is their super
02:22:42.74 --> 02:22:50.74 dirty bombs are dirty bullets are dirty and you fall in the soil and you bleed into the soil
02:22:50.74 --> 02:22:57.70 overseas and that's dirty so the vast majority of wound warriors come home especially from this war
02:22:58.74 --> 02:23:04.42 with infection problems and there's so many guys myself included that it's not your initial
02:23:04.42 --> 02:23:09.38 injuries that are as devastating I mean obviously there's levels of devastation but for so many of
02:23:09.38 --> 02:23:14.26 us it's the infection problems so many guys come back with their limbs and end up losing their limbs
02:23:14.26 --> 02:23:20.50 because of the infection I had major infection problems which caused us to continue have to do more
02:23:20.50 --> 02:23:25.30 more graphs they would have to cut out what they had done because it was infected and failed
02:23:26.02 --> 02:23:32.02 they rebuilt my nose three times so the first two they had to totally cut out and start over so
02:23:32.02 --> 02:23:36.42 that's why we were starting to run into issues hey where do we you know where do we get more
02:23:36.42 --> 02:23:43.78 cartilage where do we get more skin they can use cadaver but it does not it does not last it doesn't
02:23:43.78 --> 02:23:54.42 always take so they always want to use your own body and that's where we started to run into issues
02:23:56.74 --> 02:24:07.14 September 24th 2009 Ryan Job is dead I hadn't known Ryan incredibly well I wouldn't
02:24:07.14 --> 02:24:12.42 call him a close friend we talked on the phone occasionally we shared a common experience and discussed
02:24:12.42 --> 02:24:19.30 our notes on recovery and we shared a twisted sense of humor but above all I respected his spirit
02:24:19.30 --> 02:24:27.94 and relentless energy recapture all he could out of life he made the most of every moment and achieved
02:24:27.94 --> 02:24:35.06 things most people with their eyesight intact never would in 2008 he climbed Mount Rainier
02:24:35.78 --> 02:24:40.26 when I heard about that I was blown away in the climbing community the 14,000 foot volcanic mountain
02:24:40.26 --> 02:24:45.86 in Washington state is considered one of the most difficult to summit in all North America it has
02:24:45.86 --> 02:24:52.26 deadly crevices, narrow ledges and glacial ice it is as technical climb as you can find
02:24:52.26 --> 02:24:56.26 Mount Rainier claims on average three lives a year of those who aspire to summit
02:24:57.46 --> 02:25:02.18 and Ryan made it to the top two years after that bullet robbed him of his vision
02:25:03.62 --> 02:25:08.18 he and Kelly who he had married he and Kelly were getting ready to have a daughter together
02:25:08.18 --> 02:25:15.94 Ryan had started a new life found a fresh path to blaze and had built something from the ruins
02:25:16.98 --> 02:25:24.66 he really was being the best damn blind man out there then with the snap of cosmic fingers
02:25:24.66 --> 02:25:33.94 it was all stolen from him and if you don't know the story there was he went through one of his
02:25:33.94 --> 02:25:40.58 many surgeries because he was still going through surgeries and after the surgeries there was complications
02:25:41.38 --> 02:25:55.14 and he died as well they killed him I mean they messed up yeah there was no overdose
02:25:55.14 --> 02:26:09.30 time that was a total mistake and that slayed me Ryan's death rocked me because I know how hard
02:26:09.30 --> 02:26:17.94 it is to stay positive and to drive forward despite these really hard injuries and it just
02:26:17.94 --> 02:26:26.34 it killed me to know that you know it was a medical mistake that killed him you know I mean it's hard
02:26:26.34 --> 02:26:33.94 enough to go through all this and you survive battle and you know all these things so that that
02:26:35.22 --> 02:26:42.18 that really shook me when Ryan had died and you're still looking at unknown numbers of
02:26:42.18 --> 02:26:49.78 surgeries ahead and at the time yeah I was halfway through so this was 2009 I ended up having surgeries
02:26:49.78 --> 02:26:57.54 all the way up until 2011 yeah and the other thing that was crazy about Ryan was I'm not going to say
02:26:57.54 --> 02:27:05.14 he was out of the woods I mean but he was pretty damn far out of the woods and that's why you know
02:27:05.14 --> 02:27:23.86 to lose him like that was just a fucking nightmare yeah you at this point you still want to get back
02:27:23.86 --> 02:27:32.98 to the teams and you're trying to get your arm fixed to the point where you can have enough
02:27:32.98 --> 02:27:40.90 mobility in it to to change magazines to operate your weapon so you're going to a bunch of
02:27:40.90 --> 02:27:47.46 different people trying to see who is who can make this happen you finally find a guy that's you know
02:27:47.46 --> 02:27:53.14 you think you have a good lead on somebody that can make this happen and he you go to see him
02:27:53.14 --> 02:27:57.38 and he says going back to the book jam gonna be frank with you if you were my son I wouldn't let
02:27:57.38 --> 02:28:02.90 you do this what you have now is the best possible outcome if you proceed and have another surgery
02:28:02.90 --> 02:28:08.18 you'll probably lose some of the range of motion you have now worse you'll set yourself up for
02:28:08.18 --> 02:28:18.02 a lifetime of chronic pain the drive home was a quiet one for me as I deliberated whether or not
02:28:18.02 --> 02:28:24.26 to roll the dice one last time by the time I turned off the freeway and for Virginia Beach I knew it
02:28:24.26 --> 02:28:32.74 was not worth the risk my days as an operator were over part of me always suspected this might happen
02:28:32.74 --> 02:28:39.14 this might happen now it was confirmed I had no epiphanys during the drive home about what to do
02:28:39.14 --> 02:28:46.98 now as the that dream to kick doors again slipped away what would I do how would I support my family
02:28:46.98 --> 02:28:55.06 I didn't have any answers but I knew one thing I'd live as Ryan Joe Pat honor his memory
02:28:56.18 --> 02:28:59.06 and never take another day for granted
02:28:59.06 --> 02:29:18.34 Ryan's death reminded me that nothing is guaranteed in life it can be taken away in a heartbeat
02:29:19.70 --> 02:29:25.54 the life you've built with everything you've got can come apart and instant from circumstances
02:29:25.54 --> 02:29:33.38 far beyond your control you either adapt and overcome or you become a casualty of those twists of fate
02:29:35.46 --> 02:29:41.46 I refused to be a casualty
02:29:44.42 --> 02:29:53.46 so you get this news that hey you're not we can't do this this is what you got what you got
02:29:53.46 --> 02:30:03.62 swear you're at and the idea of getting back the operational again is gone and it's funny
02:30:03.62 --> 02:30:08.58 you know we're just talking about you know you were over talking to some students at Buds and
02:30:08.58 --> 02:30:15.06 yet a guy that was was but what a bit injured older guy you said it wasn't real to come back
02:30:15.06 --> 02:30:20.74 yeah it's medically dropped medically dropped not gonna be able to come back and so dream is gone
02:30:20.74 --> 02:30:30.18 and it's interesting you're talking to him and you've been through it and you're attitude was okay
02:30:30.90 --> 02:30:39.54 let me do now and and like I told him I mean so you know this this idea of life ambushes
02:30:40.26 --> 02:30:45.94 I told him I said you just stepped into one and there there are small ones and big ones
02:30:45.94 --> 02:30:54.34 um a lot of times they're totally unexpected but the reality is most ambushes aren't totally unexpected
02:30:54.34 --> 02:30:59.46 they're indicators that we see before we ever get into it whether we're aware of seeing them or not
02:30:59.46 --> 02:31:03.70 sometimes it's after the fact that we look back nine eleven's a good example of there were
02:31:03.70 --> 02:31:10.26 indicators that we missed before nine eleven happened for us as seals when we move into areas
02:31:10.26 --> 02:31:16.82 we know that's a bad area we are in an area where we're getting channealyzed there's high ground above us this
02:31:16.82 --> 02:31:24.58 would be a good area to execute an ambush you know for me I had seen those indicators coming
02:31:24.58 --> 02:31:29.06 so I kind of knew what was coming I had met so many doctors who said
02:31:30.10 --> 02:31:33.86 literally the doctor from Johns Hopkins who put my arm back together
02:31:33.86 --> 02:31:41.54 they actually wrote a medical journal about what he did with my elbow I mean he successfully reconstructed
02:31:41.54 --> 02:31:47.30 an elbow that had been totally destroyed and it was always funny to me there's an arrogance and I
02:31:47.30 --> 02:31:51.94 think there has to be there has to be a little bit level of arrogance and confidence and high level
02:31:51.94 --> 02:31:56.66 orthopedic certainty so every time I go meet one of these guys they'd be like oh yeah I can fix your
02:31:56.66 --> 02:32:03.46 arm and then they slapped that x-ray up and I'd watch it was like the air got sucked out of the
02:32:03.46 --> 02:32:08.82 room as they looked at it and then they would look at me and they'd say yeah man I'm sorry I
02:32:08.82 --> 02:32:14.98 they're like I don't even know how your arms work and the way it is so when I met the guy from Duke
02:32:14.98 --> 02:32:20.74 who was one of the premier you know hand and arm guys literally the guy that put my arm together was
02:32:20.74 --> 02:32:26.90 probably the premier hand and arm going I tried to get him to go back and do more and he said no
02:32:26.90 --> 02:32:32.66 he said there's no way in hell he said your arm he said going into your arm and getting what we
02:32:32.66 --> 02:32:37.70 got is a miracle he's like I am not going back in and I recommend it again stany but he
02:32:37.70 --> 02:32:43.06 all's doing it well I still try to find other doctors and it was this guy from Duke who finally
02:32:43.06 --> 02:32:51.54 convinced me so when that moment came I kind of knew so as opposed to this young man from buds it
02:32:51.54 --> 02:33:00.42 was less unexpected than what I stepped you know for me it was less unexpected so it just became where do I
02:33:00.42 --> 02:33:08.02 go from here and and interestingly enough I'd laid out some different things for myself one I wanted
02:33:08.02 --> 02:33:13.78 to do a 20 year career so that kind of became my first thing can I still stay in and finish my career
02:33:13.78 --> 02:33:22.10 maybe I can't be operational at this point I was at DMNAC and I think I was at 18 years at this point
02:33:22.10 --> 02:33:30.90 so to been four years almost four years from my injury and so over a couple of days I talked to
02:33:30.90 --> 02:33:36.10 I was working in operations and I just said hey what are our options what can we do and they
02:33:36.10 --> 02:33:43.46 actually allowed me to go work some new things different projects and different things so
02:33:43.46 --> 02:33:49.06 it was great they allowed me to finish what I set out to do but it also gave me a decent amount of
02:33:49.06 --> 02:33:54.74 time at this point it was another year before we started the medical retirement process which
02:33:54.74 --> 02:34:00.26 actually took two years so it carried me to 21 years and it gave me a lot of time to really look at
02:34:00.26 --> 02:34:05.06 you know where does my future go from here and kind of lay out what are my new passions what is
02:34:05.06 --> 02:34:10.82 my purpose and where do I go from this life after the military what can I do with all these lessons
02:34:10.82 --> 02:34:16.34 that I've learned and you know how do I pay it forward how do I honor Ryan how do I honor all these
02:34:16.34 --> 02:34:21.22 guys that every day I walk by this granite wall and they didn't get a choice they didn't get a
02:34:21.22 --> 02:34:29.30 choice to come home so thankfully you know I had that time it's still within the community but
02:34:29.30 --> 02:34:34.26 also coming to grips with the fact that you know like I talked to those young men about
02:34:35.06 --> 02:34:41.14 so many people are so strongly tied to what they do for a living that they cannot function
02:34:41.14 --> 02:34:46.66 if suddenly it's taken away from them there's a lot of a lot of me to a lot of police officers
02:34:46.66 --> 02:34:52.50 and firefighters or professional athletes that if suddenly their career is over they don't know
02:34:52.50 --> 02:34:58.34 how to function without that they've they've tied their identity so much around what they've done
02:34:59.06 --> 02:35:06.26 and I realized that the lessons that I learned in the the the seal teams and this journey that I
02:35:06.26 --> 02:35:11.94 been on was incredibly relatable and it was had nothing to do with tactical lessons you know I
02:35:11.94 --> 02:35:16.50 didn't need to be the guy that got out and taught you how to shoot or do anything and that like that
02:35:16.50 --> 02:35:23.62 what I realized is there were amazing life lessons the lessons human lessons lessons in leadership
02:35:23.62 --> 02:35:30.66 and teamwork and overcoming adversity in this idea of helping people you know not only survive but
02:35:30.66 --> 02:35:36.50 thrive from crisis and ambushes so that really started to become the path that I was walking
02:35:36.50 --> 02:35:45.70 and to help other wounded warriors well I just want to wrap this last little section of the book
02:35:45.70 --> 02:35:50.74 because we're talking about the identity and what you invested your life into and
02:35:52.34 --> 02:35:59.22 you say this I held the trident in my hand this golden emblem had driven my life I focused on it
02:35:59.22 --> 02:36:05.86 I coveted it I became enamored by it I almost lost it and then I earned it back
02:36:06.50 --> 02:36:13.94 before I sacrificed my body for it only then did I finally understand what it truly represented
02:36:14.90 --> 02:36:20.18 it carried the spirit of warrior poets like Mike Murphy, Mike Montsour and Chris Kyle
02:36:21.30 --> 02:36:27.38 it carried the spirit of my friends Ryan Job Adam Brown, Mike McGrivi, Kevin Houston
02:36:27.38 --> 02:36:33.78 and the 79 other men who have made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and the brotherhood since 9-11
02:36:35.62 --> 02:36:43.78 I didn't know why God spared me but I did know I would find a way into the future
02:36:43.78 --> 02:36:56.02 what I would use each and every day to honor my brothers who had not made it home
02:36:58.82 --> 02:37:10.42 and I think obviously you've done a lot to honor our brothers and I think you continue to do that
02:37:10.42 --> 02:37:15.30 obviously every day with what you're doing and how you're doing it and how you're taking
02:37:15.30 --> 02:37:21.54 the lessons that you learned and bringing them to more people spreading the word broadly
02:37:26.18 --> 02:37:32.98 what did that transition look like like the you know from the time you got out into where you are now
02:37:32.98 --> 02:37:35.94 because you know I mean obviously everyone that's in the military right now
02:37:35.94 --> 02:37:41.94 one day I hate to break the news to y'all one day you're gonna be not in the military anymore
02:37:43.22 --> 02:37:47.94 bring us from you know the end of your career into where you are now and where your focus right now
02:37:47.94 --> 02:37:53.22 and what you're doing yeah absolutely I think that transition is a lot harder than people realize
02:37:54.50 --> 02:37:59.46 I think a lot of things I'm sure you experience this we take for granted the level of
02:37:59.46 --> 02:38:04.50 structure that exists in the military and suddenly you get out in the spilling world and that's not
02:38:04.50 --> 02:38:09.38 there I was a little bit fortunate enough that I had launched the nonprofit when it
02:38:09.38 --> 02:38:14.82 where later it'd become the combat when the coalition while I was still on active duty but
02:38:15.38 --> 02:38:21.94 so when I got out that kind of became my focus got it I will say that I made the mistake that a lot
02:38:21.94 --> 02:38:27.78 of military members and especially special operations members make when they get out I tried to
02:38:27.78 --> 02:38:34.02 do everything everything I saw was an opportunity that I didn't want to lose out on and I
02:38:34.02 --> 02:38:39.86 falsely convinced myself yeah I have the ability to do that so running the nonprofit we did a
02:38:39.86 --> 02:38:44.66 lot of amazing things you know two and a half million dollars we helped thousands of wounded warriors
02:38:45.86 --> 02:38:52.82 even created a a program specifically to help wounded warriors build structure find their new passion
02:38:53.22 --> 02:38:57.22 but what I started to realize and I was doing all this while I was still trying to speak
02:38:57.22 --> 02:39:02.82 and develop content and work on things and take care of a family and kids and all these things
02:39:02.82 --> 02:39:09.62 and I kind of had an epiphany in 2018 I'd been doing this but you know I had retired in 2013
02:39:09.62 --> 02:39:17.62 so five years I've been doing this and I suddenly realized you've got to find that one thing
02:39:17.62 --> 02:39:24.02 that you truly are going to make a difference at and I took a step back in 2018 and said where can
02:39:24.02 --> 02:39:30.34 I have the most impact and what really is my new mission what drives my passion where is my
02:39:30.34 --> 02:39:35.54 destination where am I going to set that course to go and I realize I look back you know we're doing
02:39:35.54 --> 02:39:40.58 a lot of great things with the nonprofit but there's 43,000 veteran nonprofits out there
02:39:40.58 --> 02:39:48.82 we are losing more guys to suicide right now then we lost to the enemy and I said okay so one
02:39:48.82 --> 02:39:52.58 option is you go create a whole no they're nonprofit but there's a lot of good ones out there and I
02:39:52.58 --> 02:39:57.62 think that's part of the problem it's diluting some of the message so I said maybe
02:39:57.62 --> 02:40:05.70 I'm better off focusing on helping a whole bunch of people with this message and lending my
02:40:05.70 --> 02:40:10.98 support to another organization so myself and the board made the decision that we were going to
02:40:10.98 --> 02:40:18.02 phase down our organization in 2018 and 2019 made that shift that I'm totally focusing on delivering
02:40:18.02 --> 02:40:26.98 this content to help people overcome adversity to to launch themselves out of failure and to not only
02:40:26.98 --> 02:40:32.98 survive which some people just survive from these life ambushes from these massive catastrophic
02:40:32.98 --> 02:40:39.14 events but to thrive from them to use them as a launch point to get better and to understand how to
02:40:39.14 --> 02:40:44.90 do that and because I realize man you know this you've written all this amazing content on it and
02:40:44.90 --> 02:40:50.98 all that is coming into the second book that will come out December called over come so
02:40:51.94 --> 02:40:56.34 I have online courses that are getting ready to come on board here in the next couple of months
02:40:56.34 --> 02:41:00.66 and I just want to get out there and help as many people as I can and then lend myself to some
02:41:00.66 --> 02:41:06.10 of the organizations that are out there that are helping our wounded warriors specifically with
02:41:06.98 --> 02:41:11.22 post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries one of the things I've started doing a lot of
02:41:11.22 --> 02:41:17.30 research and what we're beginning to understand is I used to think that if we could help guys find a
02:41:17.30 --> 02:41:22.90 new purpose after they got out it would help solve their problems wounded warriors but what we're
02:41:22.90 --> 02:41:29.14 beginning to understand is that we have never the way we train now and the way we have fought
02:41:29.14 --> 02:41:36.02 wars is exposing guys especially in front line combat units and special operation units to
02:41:36.02 --> 02:41:43.14 level of blast that we've never and and up until this point the way we train the military we haven't
02:41:43.14 --> 02:41:48.50 done before so I mean you look at our breachers and how many blasts we expose them to just
02:41:48.50 --> 02:41:54.02 in training and what we're starting to see I mean I've had multiple friends now that have killed
02:41:54.02 --> 02:42:01.46 themselves who I said no way no way and I've watched these downward slides and what we're starting
02:42:01.46 --> 02:42:07.38 to find out is we are creating physiological impacts on the brain from these continued exposures
02:42:07.38 --> 02:42:13.62 to these blasts so we need more research we need you know we need more non-pharmicological solutions
02:42:13.62 --> 02:42:19.14 to these problems and there's a lot of things that are out there that are on the forefront so one
02:42:19.14 --> 02:42:23.54 of the things with research I started doing some stuff with the concussion legacy foundation which
02:42:23.54 --> 02:42:28.90 is the same group working with the NFL or you know highlighting the impact of CTE on NFL
02:42:28.90 --> 02:42:35.62 players and we're beginning to realize that some of our special operations guys like Rob Guzo
02:42:35.62 --> 02:42:42.50 who took his life severe CTE but what they figured out is it's different some of the pre-mear
02:42:42.50 --> 02:42:48.74 neurologists that are out there are figuring out it's different it's blast and the blast goes
02:42:48.74 --> 02:42:52.82 all the way through the brain as opposed to a concussion that creates an impact and there's
02:42:52.82 --> 02:42:58.90 a centralized location now for guys or even Dallas out there that have had multiple concussions that
02:42:58.90 --> 02:43:04.66 creates more but the bottom line is we need this research so I donated my brain to the concussion
02:43:04.66 --> 02:43:09.54 legacy foundation and I'm encouraging all the veterans that are out there if you have been in combat
02:43:09.54 --> 02:43:15.78 don't hate your brain you don't need it you don't need it when you're gone and they're not
02:43:15.78 --> 02:43:21.54 going to come early and collect you know but the bottom line is it is an amazing way to be
02:43:21.54 --> 02:43:27.30 able to give back to the veterans that are coming up behind you because they don't have enough
02:43:27.30 --> 02:43:31.62 veteran brains in the brain banks that are out there to understand the kind of trauma we're
02:43:31.62 --> 02:43:37.38 putting on our brains and until they and and obviously they can't study the brains while we're still
02:43:37.38 --> 02:43:43.94 alive so if if you want a way to get back look up the concussion legacy foundation and don't
02:43:43.94 --> 02:43:48.66 at your brain I did it we need the research twenty thirty years from now we can make a difference to
02:43:48.66 --> 02:43:55.14 save some young lawyer that's out there that got exposed to blasts and now can't figure out why
02:43:55.14 --> 02:44:02.34 his world is falling apart around him so those are my passions that's my purpose and I want to
02:44:02.34 --> 02:44:06.90 help as many people out there I want to make you better help you thrive from adversity help you
02:44:06.90 --> 02:44:11.70 thrive from failure and crisis and for our wounded warriors I want to help try and solve this
02:44:13.22 --> 02:44:18.74 epidemic we're seeing in the suicides in the brain trauma yeah that's I mean that's just
02:44:18.74 --> 02:44:25.14 awesome it's awesome see moving forward with that and I know it would be going for a while here
02:44:25.78 --> 02:44:30.90 and that's probably a pretty good place to wrap where do you where can people find you
02:44:30.90 --> 02:44:35.94 where should people locate you and when they want to when they want to hear from you yeah absolutely
02:44:35.94 --> 02:44:40.10 best place go to Jason Redmond dot com that's my website and you can see what I'm doing
02:44:40.82 --> 02:44:46.82 you can contact me through there I'm on all the major social media platforms Jason Redmond on Facebook
02:44:46.82 --> 02:44:56.42 and Jason Redmond WW on Instagram and Twitter awesome echo speaking of making people better
02:44:57.46 --> 02:45:03.14 you have any quick recommendations on how you know we can improve ourselves sure this is echo
02:45:03.14 --> 02:45:08.34 Charles by the way I have one question in Ranger School when they told you to like all right
02:45:08.34 --> 02:45:14.18 when they asked you you need your Gucci was that the thing that kind of sent you over there when
02:45:14.18 --> 02:45:20.42 they said the Gucci thing no I don't think it was that I really it was it was the land nav
02:45:20.42 --> 02:45:27.62 comments I mean I taught land nav so the funny thing about that Gucci jacket is so the army guys
02:45:27.62 --> 02:45:34.42 were only allowed to wear the army jacket liner well we didn't have those and I had Gucci
02:45:34.42 --> 02:45:40.98 batagonia I had the remember the green for me said came yeah that's what I had so every day I put
02:45:40.98 --> 02:45:47.86 that on the Ranger instructors would lose their mind and and in the beginning I had such a bad
02:45:47.86 --> 02:45:53.30 attitude that I just took it in the negative way but the second time I went through it became the
02:45:53.30 --> 02:46:02.18 how often can I put this on and spend these so I still have it every time I pull it out of my
02:46:02.18 --> 02:46:08.90 closet it puts a smile on my face nice nice what else yeah no that's it for questions yeah yeah
02:46:08.90 --> 02:46:13.62 we can talk about getting better though yeah and and Jay's about to start training jjitsu boom
02:46:13.62 --> 02:46:23.38 so he's gonna need a jjitsu key so we need to get that hooked up where we're gonna hook him up with a key from
02:46:23.38 --> 02:46:27.62 origin 100% not even 99% 100% 100% or an all-made in America that's what we need you know continue to
02:46:27.62 --> 02:46:33.78 grow this country yes sir so yeah origin if you're into jjitsu getting into jjitsu or already
02:46:33.78 --> 02:46:40.42 and jjitsu you want a key a new key or another key i thought you're gonna say used key
02:46:40.42 --> 02:46:46.50 you know you don't use the market for used geese no there's a lot of people who are
02:46:46.50 --> 02:46:50.66 at the parent he there's people out there that would love a jjaco game but that gets a little weird
02:46:50.66 --> 02:46:57.54 yeah that doesn't smell good well yeah maybe some some people maybe if someone like
02:46:57.54 --> 02:47:03.06 lost weight or something you know you use this game you were out these two eventually you were out
02:47:03.06 --> 02:47:06.50 of geese or you get a new one I was talking to Pete the other day the amount of
02:47:06.50 --> 02:47:14.10 geopants or geese period that have been returned is like so as said yeah we get like three
02:47:14.10 --> 02:47:17.94 geese back a year with some of the action warrants about they just don't wear out the
02:47:17.94 --> 02:47:23.06 warrants and geese just do not wear out yeah so get something up yeah you gotta like um yeah
02:47:23.06 --> 02:47:27.94 like if you lose weight or something and then you don't use it anymore or if you're like you get
02:47:27.94 --> 02:47:31.54 the new one and you know all like you turn you back to the old one because the new one that's the
02:47:31.54 --> 02:47:35.86 new hotness you know you don't really wear it anymore so you give it to your friend or something like this
02:47:35.86 --> 02:47:43.94 check that out like there's that you get these rash guards t-shirts uh other stuff yeah supplements
02:47:43.94 --> 02:47:50.74 supplements joint warfare joint warfare and cruel oil turned out to be the most important supplements
02:47:50.74 --> 02:47:55.94 there are in my opinion they thought it was a protein powder and the creatine that's what we thought
02:47:55.94 --> 02:48:00.74 in the beginning many more joint joint warfare hundred percent these we thought that yeah well
02:48:00.74 --> 02:48:06.66 yes I agree we do have Joe Warfare control and if you do want protein you might as well
02:48:07.62 --> 02:48:13.54 enjoy it yes get yourself some milk it's still good for you get on the milk we need the
02:48:13.54 --> 02:48:19.94 protein that's where we have milk which have you tried milk I have okay we need to use some milk
02:48:19.94 --> 02:48:26.26 and especially well it depends what flavors you like I like mint chocolate chip I am a fan of
02:48:26.26 --> 02:48:32.90 okay so each is a mint milk but apparently doc Luke hates mint well apparently he was going
02:48:32.90 --> 02:48:38.90 berserker the other day saying why would you drink something that tastes like toothpaste yeah
02:48:38.90 --> 02:48:45.38 yeah but so as it turns out some you know to back to another fence analogy some it's like you
02:48:45.38 --> 02:48:50.34 either love it or you really don't like it that's what as it turns out that's the situation with them
02:48:50.34 --> 02:48:55.62 we got mint peanut butter chocolate vanilla gorilla I'm a huge fan peanut butter chocolate
02:48:55.62 --> 02:49:02.42 okay okay that's my jam I do like mint chocolate but I got hostile with my whole family the
02:49:02.42 --> 02:49:08.98 other day well not with my whole family with my wife and my youngest daughter because there was
02:49:08.98 --> 02:49:14.10 no I wanted some yogurt and there was no blueberry there was no strawberry there was no coconut
02:49:14.10 --> 02:49:23.78 there was only vanilla and so I started saying why would a human being in 2019 buy vanilla yogurt
02:49:23.78 --> 02:49:29.14 like chewed and all that yeah I get if it comes in the variety pack and you end up with it
02:49:29.14 --> 02:49:36.10 you understood but straight up select it no wrong answer yeah so I had to get hostile super
02:49:36.10 --> 02:49:40.58 hostile and I was telling my wife and my youngest daughter that they are crazy for just
02:49:40.58 --> 02:49:45.46 liking that vanilla yeah they are for sure but at the end of the day you don't get to understand
02:49:45.46 --> 02:49:50.58 I was other people they have other opinions my my youngest daughter nine years old she makes
02:49:50.58 --> 02:49:54.58 so what she does is she takes strawberries caught some up and then she puts a whipped cream on it
02:49:55.14 --> 02:50:01.22 and then she takes warrior kid milk strawberry and sprinkles that nice yeah
02:50:01.22 --> 02:50:07.62 cornmeal so chocolate protein yeah well protein protein from yeah cool yeah it's good
02:50:07.62 --> 02:50:12.26 oh yeah where you can milk that's for the kids right little more formula like that I know
02:50:12.26 --> 02:50:19.38 that possibly do drink it like me they sneak it yes they do also if you want to represent
02:50:19.38 --> 02:50:25.54 while you're on this path to get to working out waking up early I do I get up at five
