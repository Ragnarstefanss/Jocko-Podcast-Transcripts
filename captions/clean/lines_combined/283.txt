00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.02 This is Jockel podcast number 283 with echo Charles and me. Jockel willing good evening echo.
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:08.02 Good evening.
00:00:08.02 --> 00:00:14.80 Jumping into combat lessons. We've done some combat lessons before. We've done volumes
00:00:14.80 --> 00:00:20.56 one two and three on this podcast. I'm skipping ahead a little bit to volume seven.
00:00:20.56 --> 00:00:26.96 There's a section here that I kind of got kind of got into. These combat lessons were written
00:00:26.96 --> 00:00:34.56 during World War II with the explicit intention of disseminating lessons learned rapidly
00:00:34.56 --> 00:00:41.84 back to the troops to keep more guys alive and kill more enemy. And you might think
00:00:41.84 --> 00:00:46.80 and I started thinking like why am I reviewing these? Why am I reviewing number four?
00:00:46.80 --> 00:00:51.44 Why am I doing that? I'll tell you why. Because I've never heard these lessons before.
00:00:51.44 --> 00:00:58.16 Think about that. I was in the military for 20 years and I never heard these lessons before.
00:00:58.96 --> 00:01:03.76 There's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with that. These guys,
00:01:03.76 --> 00:01:08.80 these are lessons written in blood in the hardest combat imaginable.
00:01:10.88 --> 00:01:15.68 And they're not in the past on. So I want to make sure I pass on these lessons. And you know what?
00:01:15.68 --> 00:01:21.68 Obviously, they're not just for combat. Not just for combat. You're going to see the translation
00:01:21.68 --> 00:01:25.60 to every situation that a human being and a leadership position can be in.
00:01:28.88 --> 00:01:35.52 So combat lessons. The volumes are getting better. So the first one was kind of like a little
00:01:35.52 --> 00:01:40.64 bit. I'm not going to say it was half-hazardly put together. But now you got the full
00:01:40.64 --> 00:01:46.000 cover picture. You know, they're if you're looking at this on YouTube, you got the cover picture up.
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.72 They're combat lessons. Combat lessons number seven, rank and file and combat. What they do,
00:01:51.60 --> 00:01:58.64 what they are doing and how they do it. The intro to this thing, to this book, comes from,
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.40 I'll just read it. Our armies in Europe have won their victory. So this is late in the war.
00:02:05.28 --> 00:02:08.88 Victory in Europe already. So now we're just fighting in the Pacific theater.
00:02:08.88 --> 00:02:13.44 Veterans of the campaigns of North Africa and Europe are now joining forces with the veterans of
00:02:13.44 --> 00:02:19.52 the Pacific for the final assault against Japan. Can you imagine having that on the horizon?
00:02:21.12 --> 00:02:29.68 You're thinking, okay, we're going final assault on Japan on the Japanese Empire. We're going
00:02:29.68 --> 00:02:32.72 to kill all of them because they fight to the death. That's what's about to happen.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.08 They don't, they don't know anything about the atomic bomb yet. That's not even an option.
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:44.16 They've seen the Japanese fight to the death on island after island. And now they're going to go
00:02:44.16 --> 00:02:51.12 and assault the Japanese island itself. The island of Japan. Back to the book, they are coming
00:02:51.12 --> 00:02:56.08 to grips with a folk quite different from the German soldier, different as an individual fighting
00:02:56.08 --> 00:03:02.16 man and different in the tactics employed. Even the most experienced soldier of the European battlefields
00:03:02.16 --> 00:03:09.04 will have much to learn. Humility. You imagine you get done with Normandy, the D-Day, the Battle
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:12.72 of the Bulge and you show up in the Pacific theater. You got a lot to learn, kid.
00:03:14.64 --> 00:03:20.48 Dang. We must now bring to bear against the Japanese all the experience we have gained in every
00:03:20.48 --> 00:03:26.88 theater. The suggestions made in combat lessons are drawn from such expert experience. Since to be
00:03:26.88 --> 00:03:32.40 effective, they must reach the soldier promptly. Publication is not delayed to ensure that they
00:03:32.40 --> 00:03:38.96 always represent the thoroughly digested views of the war department. The great combat lesson
00:03:38.96 --> 00:03:46.16 learned from every operation is the importance of leadership. Our equipment, our supply and above
00:03:46.16 --> 00:03:55.12 our men are splendid. Aggressive and determined leadership is the priceless factor which inspires
00:03:55.12 --> 00:04:04.56 a command and upon which success all success in battle depends. It is responsible for success or failure.
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:08.56 Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. By the way, signed by General Marshall,
00:04:09.44 --> 00:04:18.24 five star general. Three, no, four, no, five star general. Churchill called General Marshall,
00:04:18.24 --> 00:04:24.56 the organizer of victory. The organizer of victory of World War II. Let's think about that. That's
00:04:24.56 --> 00:04:30.16 a pretty good compliment coming from Churchill. This is a guy that was a platoon in a company commander
00:04:30.16 --> 00:04:36.88 in the Philippine war. Ended up being a secretary state. Remember to learn about the Marshall
00:04:36.88 --> 00:04:41.84 plan? Well, when you were in high school at some point you learned about the Marshall plan. You
00:04:41.84 --> 00:04:48.32 just don't remember it. It was like the World War II. It was the recovery. The rebuilding
00:04:48.32 --> 00:04:55.12 after World War II oversees in Europe that the Marshall plan named after this guy. He got a no
00:04:55.12 --> 00:05:01.68 bell piece for us for that. By the way, a very capable man. So kicking it into the book here,
00:05:02.48 --> 00:05:08.64 leadership. First section, leadership. Too much stress cannot be placed upon the necessity for
00:05:08.64 --> 00:05:16.16 developing intelligent aggressive troop leaders in all echelons. So says General Omar Bradley
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:23.92 Commander of the 12th Army Group. I want to say that again, too much stress cannot be placed.
00:05:23.92 --> 00:05:30.56 There's no way you can stress the necessity for developing intelligent aggressive troop leaders
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.92 and where in all echelons, in all echelons, squad leaders. However, to use the battlefield as a
00:05:41.92 --> 00:05:46.88 school room for the training of leaders is to sacrifice needlessly the lives of our men, the habit
00:05:46.88 --> 00:05:52.08 of command and the technique of troop leading must be learned thoroughly by all leaders prior to
00:05:52.08 --> 00:06:00.08 entry in combat. Not only must leaders learn their own jobs thoroughly, but they must also be given
00:06:00.08 --> 00:06:07.12 ample opportunity to operate in the command capacity of the next higher echelon in order that
00:06:07.12 --> 00:06:12.16 qualified replacements will be available. So if you're running a business, I said there's some
00:06:12.16 --> 00:06:15.60 similarities. If you're running a business and you're not investing in your leadership, you're wrong.
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:21.68 And throwing them out to the wolves, throwing them out to the clients, throw them out to a building
00:06:21.68 --> 00:06:27.04 site without any training and preparation or without any mentorship while they're out there is the wrong
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:36.08 move. By the way, that's why echelon front actually exists. That's why we exist to help that process
00:06:36.08 --> 00:06:42.64 take place. The junior leaders responsibility, field leaders constantly emphasize the need for junior
00:06:42.64 --> 00:06:48.40 officers who will share the responsibilities of their superiors and take charge when emergencies arise
00:06:48.40 --> 00:06:57.92 in battle. Check this out. Here's a note. You're young. You're new to the company. You're inexperienced
00:06:57.92 --> 00:07:05.92 in some way or another way. If you have the willingness to pay attention and then start taking
00:07:05.92 --> 00:07:11.68 responsibility and start taking ownership of things, you will go places. Now look, you got to be,
00:07:11.68 --> 00:07:17.68 you don't want to go overboard with it. But if you see your boss has got some things that maybe
00:07:17.68 --> 00:07:25.20 you could take over for, take them over. Have a question. Go. But extreme ownership and this
00:07:25.20 --> 00:07:31.92 might be splitting hairs, but in the spirit of understanding. So let's say whatever you come to me
00:07:33.12 --> 00:07:43.04 and or whatever. I'm taking ownership of a mistake that happened. What if I do, I am like,
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:50.16 I'm not blaming you, but I am defensive. I am whatever. I am all that, but I actually do at the end of
00:07:50.16 --> 00:07:57.92 the lecture or whatever. I do want to, at the end of the day, I do think that the mistake was my
00:07:57.92 --> 00:08:04.80 fall 100% and I'm going to take it upon myself to fix the mistake. But I handled the initial
00:08:04.80 --> 00:08:13.36 lecture wrong. Is that still technically extreme ownership? Why am I lecturing you? I don't know.
00:08:13.36 --> 00:08:18.80 Like a, you know, I messed up the project. Okay, you know, failed the project. And then
00:08:18.80 --> 00:08:23.68 I come to you and say, hey, echo, it looks like we're not going to get this project done on time.
00:08:23.68 --> 00:08:28.72 Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Like, or let's say we straight up didn't fail. Okay. Oh,
00:08:29.12 --> 00:08:36.000 echo, I see that we failed to get this project done. Yeah. Did you get the support that you
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.44 need? Is there anything that I should have done a better job up to make sure you had what you need
00:08:39.44 --> 00:08:42.64 to get this thing done? Because this is a big let down for the client. Yeah. And this is in the
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:48.72 kind of reputation we're looking to have. Where did I let you down? Okay. So that's a you take
00:08:48.72 --> 00:08:53.92 ownership, right? Extreme, you know, and you're like, okay. So what if instead of that good
00:08:53.92 --> 00:08:58.64 lecture, you were like, hey, you messed up and you, you know, like you did this in a go.
00:08:58.64 --> 00:09:03.20 Yeah, go. You failed this project. That's pathetic. I'm thinking about maybe
00:09:03.20 --> 00:09:08.32 demoting you. Yeah. And then let's say, okay, after you lecture me, you think in your head,
00:09:08.32 --> 00:09:13.12 you know what? This is my fault. This actually is my fault. And I'm going to do everything I can
00:09:13.12 --> 00:09:19.60 to to correct this. You do after you lecture me the law with you, but then I realize I'm wrong. Yes.
00:09:19.60 --> 00:09:22.64 And then I said, you know what? There's some things I could have problems with. No, you don't say
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:27.44 that part. Okay. You don't say nothing to me. You just kind of at you. Basically the whole thing
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:31.20 you learned the lesson. You failed the first part, but it's like, you know, you do the
00:09:31.20 --> 00:09:37.60 car. You failed the first one, but you succeed in the second one. Okay. But then I opt
00:09:37.60 --> 00:09:43.52 not to take ownership for some reason. With your verbal, it's a wrong idea. You can see where
00:09:43.52 --> 00:09:48.72 you can see where this is. What's interesting about these questions that you're trying to formulate
00:09:49.68 --> 00:09:55.12 is how quickly they dissipate when the person legitimately takes ownership. Right. All, like when I
00:09:55.12 --> 00:09:58.80 said, okay, so I say to you, hey, echo, where did I not support you? All of a sudden, you didn't even
00:09:58.80 --> 00:10:02.32 have an argument. You didn't have a question anymore. It was gone. You had to get me to say thing
00:10:02.32 --> 00:10:08.40 wrong to you. Yes. And then you want me to like switch halfway because I'm just a crazy person.
00:10:09.36 --> 00:10:14.08 So that's what we're at right now. Which is fine. Okay. So what's the hypothetical point that we're
00:10:14.08 --> 00:10:20.08 trying to get out? Well, I guess if I if I learned anything from you right now and in the past,
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:25.84 it is that if you're going to take ownership extreme, well, if you're going to demonstrate that
00:10:25.84 --> 00:10:32.80 practice that, there's two parts of it and that's sort of it. There's two parts of it. You the way you
00:10:32.80 --> 00:10:37.28 come at the person or whatever, you let them know that it's your fault kind of thing. And then the second
00:10:37.28 --> 00:10:42.64 part is you for real, it is your fault in your mind. It is. It is your responsibility to take action
00:10:42.64 --> 00:10:47.84 to fix those problems. Not the kind of one that's in your question is when I come at you and say,
00:10:47.84 --> 00:10:52.08 you failed this project, you go, well, you're a big project. So you get defensive at first, right?
00:10:52.08 --> 00:10:57.52 Yes, because you take it the wrong way. And you don't remember to take ownership for another two minutes.
00:10:57.52 --> 00:11:03.60 The whole thing, the whole time you forget to take ownership and the last two minutes, you know what you do?
00:11:04.32 --> 00:11:09.92 You go, you know what, you know what boss, I'm getting defensive because my ego is getting in the way.
00:11:09.92 --> 00:11:14.80 And this is actually my fault. And all these excuses that I'm making right now make no sense whatsoever.
00:11:14.80 --> 00:11:19.20 Here's the mistakes I made. Here's the things I'm going to do to fix it. I will not let this happen again.
00:11:19.20 --> 00:11:25.28 Yeah, I'll get all myself. Yeah. So without that second recovery part, I'm talking about the interaction between the two people.
00:11:25.28 --> 00:11:31.28 Mm-hmm. That alone not that subsequent actions that you're going to take to solve the problem. I'm not talking about that because you're going to do that anyway.
00:11:31.28 --> 00:11:40.16 Yeah. But that second verbal part interaction part without that that technically does not fit. Does not fulfill the formula of extreme ownership.
00:11:40.16 --> 00:11:46.24 What do you mean without that second part? Which second part? The part where you're, where you explain to the person that you have the interaction with?
00:11:46.24 --> 00:11:50.08 Like, all of that was my fault. And my ego's getting away. Like not that part.
00:11:50.08 --> 00:11:56.08 Straight up, you left the meeting straight up like we got scolded. Oh, whatever. Then, and then you say,
00:11:56.08 --> 00:11:59.28 this wasn't my fault and you leave. Yeah. Yeah. You have to take ownership of that.
00:11:59.28 --> 00:12:02.96 That's the point of extreme ownership. Right in your mind, you're like, wait, it is my fault.
00:12:02.96 --> 00:12:05.36 Yeah, then you go back and then you say, hey, this is, that's what I'm saying.
00:12:05.36 --> 00:12:09.76 Okay, you do that. The interaction is part of the, yes. Yes, it is.
00:12:09.76 --> 00:12:14.88 You have to, I mean, otherwise you're just making excuses and blame another people. And I don't trust you by the way.
00:12:14.88 --> 00:12:17.76 Yeah. I'm like, oh, echo screwed this up, but he isn't even realized that he screws up.
00:12:17.76 --> 00:12:21.68 He thinks it's a devil and else is fault. He doesn't take ownership. Cool. I'm never given him another project again.
00:12:22.64 --> 00:12:26.16 Whereas you come back and he said, you know what, boss, this is, this is completely my fault.
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:29.76 And then I let my ego get in the way. And I got mad. My temper and my ego.
00:12:30.48 --> 00:12:32.80 I will not let that happen again. Boom.
00:12:33.92 --> 00:12:36.40 Problem solved. I understand. Check.
00:12:37.44 --> 00:12:39.52 All right. Moving on.
00:12:39.52 --> 00:12:47.20 Comments, major general John P. Lucas commander of six core. Prior to battle, we must develop the feeling of
00:12:47.20 --> 00:12:52.56 responsibility and junior officers and non-commissioned officers develop the feeling of responsibility.
00:12:52.56 --> 00:12:59.68 We want to give them ownership. I suggest doing this during field exercises by suddenly an
00:12:59.68 --> 00:13:06.08 and unexpectedly declaring the commander a casualty and placing the second in command in charge.
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:10.64 Something did all the time in seal training. Oh, got a good platoon commander. He's doing a great job. Cool.
00:13:10.64 --> 00:13:13.84 You're down. Oh, platoon chiefs doing a super job. Cool. You're down.
00:13:15.52 --> 00:13:20.08 But commanding officer of the 119th Infantry in Germany makes this statement in battle. Nothing is
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:26.08 more important than having leaders who will share their commanders responsibility for the accomplishment
00:13:26.08 --> 00:13:31.04 of the mission. Again, if you're a junior person out there, if you're joining an organization or
00:13:31.04 --> 00:13:35.76 you're a mid-level manager, if you can be a person that starts to take ownership of things
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:42.64 and starts to take pressure and jobs and tasks and responsibilities off your bosses play,
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:50.56 they are going to love you. Nothing more important. He says. Nothing more important than having
00:13:50.56 --> 00:13:55.60 leaders that will take their share of the commanders of responsibility. One of the most difficult
00:13:55.60 --> 00:14:03.36 tasks for the junior leader is getting the men to move forward under fire. Issuing the orders is
00:14:03.36 --> 00:14:09.76 easy, but seeing that the orders are carried out may call for every ounce of energy and initiative
00:14:09.76 --> 00:14:18.32 the officer or NCO possesses. Issuing the orders is easy. That's easy, Bart. I think Paton said
00:14:18.32 --> 00:14:28.24 10% of the job is issuing orders. 90% is getting them done. Responsible leadership in actions
00:14:28.24 --> 00:14:35.20 the next section. Captain Souter was at his command post CP when a soldier came into report that
00:14:35.20 --> 00:14:40.96 two wiremen had been wounded by an enemy sniper about 500 yards away. He immediately took four men
00:14:40.96 --> 00:14:46.16 and set out to assist the wounded men. Before arriving at their goal, the captain and his men
00:14:46.16 --> 00:14:52.72 observed a group of wiremen pinned down in an open field by enemy machine gun fire. Captain Souter
00:14:52.72 --> 00:14:57.52 spotted the enemy machine gun and ordered his men to cover positions but himself took an
00:14:57.52 --> 00:15:02.000 exposed position from which he could fire upon the machine gun. He opened fire suddenly and killed
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.28 six of the enemy crew making it possible for the wounded men to be evacuated in safety and for the
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:12.56 wiremen to continue their work. By that time, Captain Souter had observed more serious trouble
00:15:12.56 --> 00:15:17.60 in the vicinity. An enemy armored car was part-beside a building some distance away.
00:15:18.40 --> 00:15:23.20 The captain knew that part of another advancing regiment was in the sector covered by the enemy
00:15:23.20 --> 00:15:28.24 vehicle. He immediately sent back for a 50 caliber machine gun at the command post and for two
00:15:28.24 --> 00:15:33.68 tanks to cover the oncoming regiment during its approach. While waiting for these reinforcements he
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:39.12 collected a few of his men and resumed fire on the enemy with the result that many were forced to
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:44.88 flee an 18 enemy were wounded. While this was going on, Captain Souter was informed that all officers
00:15:44.88 --> 00:15:49.68 of one company with the approaching regiment had become casualties. He immediately took charge
00:15:49.68 --> 00:15:56.16 and reorganized the company so at the when the other officers came up, the unit was well dispersed
00:15:56.16 --> 00:16:02.40 and under control. He then gave first aid to the wounded officer officers and saw that they were
00:16:02.40 --> 00:16:07.92 evacuated to a safer location for further care. The tanks arrived in time to assist the other
00:16:07.92 --> 00:16:12.32 regiments assault on the enemy positions and the objective was successfully taken. Had it not been
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:17.28 for Captain Souter's timely and decisive actions, casualties among our men would have been extremely
00:16:17.28 --> 00:16:22.80 heavy and the attainment of the objective questionable. First contribution in this emergency,
00:16:22.80 --> 00:16:24.80 Captain Souter was awarded the Silver Star.
00:16:26.88 --> 00:16:32.08 Initiative taking charge. I love this part where he got wounded as a company coming forward and
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:36.24 they're wounded officers so you disperse your company and you prepare to receive those guys
00:16:36.24 --> 00:16:45.68 and you're able to put him to work immediately. Responsible leadership as the soldier sees it.
00:16:45.68 --> 00:16:50.32 Another final example of responsible and inspiring leadership is given in the following account
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:58.32 of the part played by Lieutenant William E. Everett, 101st Infantry, 36 Division A in action in
00:16:58.32 --> 00:17:04.16 Italy. This account was written by three of the enlisted men who served under him during that
00:17:04.16 --> 00:17:10.24 action. Our company led the attack on a hill and took it. The enemy counter attacked laying down heavy
00:17:10.24 --> 00:17:16.32 artillery, mortar and machine gun fire that knocked out a large number of our men and every officer
00:17:16.32 --> 00:17:26.40 except Lieutenant Everett. Lieutenant Everett took over the difficult and dangerous job of keeping
00:17:26.40 --> 00:17:32.96 the company under control without any communications whatever. He had become so short of men
00:17:32.96 --> 00:17:37.84 that even the runners had to stay on the line fighting hard to help hold the ground we had won.
00:17:37.84 --> 00:17:44.48 At the time Lieutenant Everett took charge the enemy were coming up three sides of the hill
00:17:44.48 --> 00:17:49.52 and our men were in trouble. The Lieutenant ordered us to open fire with everything we had
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:55.84 while he took an exposed position on the side of the hill and called fire orders to our mortar.
00:17:55.84 --> 00:18:00.88 Our mortar finally stopped the advancing enemy. He then located an enemy mortar that had been
00:18:00.88 --> 00:18:05.92 giving us trouble all day and adjusted our mortar on it. Notking it out with a direct hit on the
00:18:05.92 --> 00:18:11.28 third ground. He personally eliminated two enemy snipers who had wounded several of our men.
00:18:11.28 --> 00:18:16.08 It was largely through his daring and determination that we were able to beat off the strong
00:18:16.08 --> 00:18:20.64 enemy counter attacks. For three days and four nights he risked his life by going from one
00:18:20.64 --> 00:18:25.76 platoon to another under enemy machine gun fire keeping the men under control and helping them
00:18:25.76 --> 00:18:31.60 meet each problem as it came. At times he himself helped carry the wounded to save for places.
00:18:31.60 --> 00:18:38.16 The Lieutenant was sick during all this fighting yet he never thought of his own discomfort but
00:18:38.16 --> 00:18:42.88 stuck by the men who might have lost out if he had not been for his leadership.
00:18:49.12 --> 00:18:51.12 Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
00:18:54.88 --> 00:18:58.08 Next section discipline the first function of leadership.
00:18:58.08 --> 00:19:06.56 You know I'm happy and smiling when I see that. In the frequent discussions of battlefield
00:19:06.56 --> 00:19:11.44 leadership we are often prone to overlook the first function of leadership. The development of
00:19:11.44 --> 00:19:16.000 unit and individual discipline. The battle is the payoff.
00:19:17.68 --> 00:19:24.16 Said Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Ingersall and it is exactly that. The payoff on the leadership
00:19:24.16 --> 00:19:30.80 which welded individuals into a smoothly functioning team. Discipline applies to all
00:19:30.80 --> 00:19:37.68 Captain Jack Gary company commander of the 11th Infantry writes. Discipline is sometimes
00:19:37.68 --> 00:19:40.24 the determining factor between winning and losing.
00:19:42.80 --> 00:19:47.76 I once listened to a wounded officer back from fighting in Africa who said forget all the
00:19:47.76 --> 00:19:52.16 formalities in the field forget the officer and NCO distinctions in the field. Keep all the
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:57.36 eight balls they will fight like hell and I tried to look up this term eight balls and
00:19:58.08 --> 00:20:04.40 I assume it means like a like a rebel type guy. The reason I assume that is because the next sentence says
00:20:05.12 --> 00:20:10.32 so that that was the guy quoting someone from Africa. He says I do not believe he had seen very
00:20:10.32 --> 00:20:16.88 much action or he would not have made such a statement. I had a few quote eight balls who did
00:20:16.88 --> 00:20:22.32 fight like hell but I have also had a lot of men who never caused me trouble who were quiet,
00:20:22.32 --> 00:20:30.000 confident, well disciplined and these men fought much better. So you know you get that in case of
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.80 war, break glass thing where look this guy's little rough around the edges.
00:20:34.80 --> 00:20:39.20 Yeah it seemed like when he was like I also had guys who were quite calm discipline whatever
00:20:39.20 --> 00:20:42.96 it just seemed like this eight ball phenomenon was the opposite of that. They're like the trouble
00:20:42.96 --> 00:20:47.92 makers. They're a little bit a little bit wild. Now look gotta have those guys too. We're going to need
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:54.48 those guys and they do have it. They can be awesome for sure because you gotta have a little bit of that.
00:20:55.60 --> 00:20:59.84 I mean let's face it if you're joining the military. If you're joining the military to
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:03.76 go into combat arms or you're joining the military to go in special operations you're going in
00:21:03.76 --> 00:21:08.72 that you want to do something that's you basically want to do things that are not legal in the world.
00:21:08.72 --> 00:21:13.76 That's like you're going to kill people you're going to blow things up you're going to plant
00:21:13.76 --> 00:21:18.56 bombs that's what you're going to do. You can't really do that anywhere. Yes that's you know you're
00:21:18.56 --> 00:21:23.68 a kid and you're like what do I want to do when I grow up doctor. Boyer. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:30.64 Blow things up and kill people. That sounds like a good one. Right? That's not normal.
00:21:30.64 --> 00:21:31.84 And just an answer.
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:36.72 Had a conversation with a guy the other day and he was like telling me that
00:21:36.72 --> 00:21:40.80 he was having a conversation with a guy that was a seal and he's like, you know there's
00:21:40.80 --> 00:21:45.84 something that made me nervous. Because when this guy was a young seal he said you know I
00:21:46.24 --> 00:21:50.56 I was asking him, you know you you think you're ready to kill people and you know you're
00:21:50.56 --> 00:21:54.48 going to deploy and this was kind of as Iraq was going on and this was like a younger seal that was
00:21:54.48 --> 00:22:00.72 going to be heading to Iraq and the young seal was like oh yeah I'm ready I want to kill people
00:22:00.72 --> 00:22:05.60 and he's you know the guy says you know just seemed a little bit seems like it shouldn't be like that
00:22:05.60 --> 00:22:14.48 and I was like it's like that bro. I go you know you know a frontline infantry grunt whatever
00:22:15.36 --> 00:22:19.92 well I can't I can't speak for all of them. You talk to most of Asmajority of seals
00:22:21.28 --> 00:22:25.36 and you say hey if the enemy presents themselves an opportunity if the enemy if there's an
00:22:25.36 --> 00:22:34.48 opportunity for you to kill the enemy will you be happy the right word will you be will you hesitate
00:22:34.48 --> 00:22:39.84 in the moment truth I'll be like one negative nobody's stoked so that's the reality so
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:47.12 there's a little eight ball you know let's face it. He's down for the cost yeah now that's that's
00:22:47.12 --> 00:22:55.28 the thing is the the very good soldier that you want has that capability but has the discipline
00:22:55.28 --> 00:23:01.04 to keep it under control the whole the little clip you made of Jordan Peterson and I talking about
00:23:01.04 --> 00:23:09.60 the the the good man is a dangerous man who has their their their danger and their aggression
00:23:10.24 --> 00:23:15.44 under control under through discipline all in Terry control that's what what are looking for
00:23:15.44 --> 00:23:18.88 that's what are looking for yeah actually that's what we're looking for
00:23:21.76 --> 00:23:27.20 next section discipline is based upon competence only a few hours later after he had lost
00:23:27.20 --> 00:23:33.76 both legs in combat lieutenant tickinore who had acted as a platoon leader in fifth division 12
00:23:33.76 --> 00:23:39.84 army group made this comment to a military observer our officers have to be real leaders
00:23:40.72 --> 00:23:47.76 discipline in combat depends largely upon the men's knowing that the officer in charge of them
00:23:47.76 --> 00:23:54.64 knows his business and is not reluctant reluctant to take necessary risks. A batiling commander
00:23:54.64 --> 00:24:00.08 of the sixth armor division in France makes a similar combat comment unless the officer or
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:07.04 NCO knows his job completely the men have no faith in him unless the men have faith in their
00:24:07.04 --> 00:24:15.04 leaders their battle discipline will be poor so when they're talking about discipline there they're like
00:24:15.04 --> 00:24:19.36 are you is the team going to knew what they need to do when they get when they get the orders to do it
00:24:19.36 --> 00:24:25.60 and if they have faith in the leader they'll do it and if they don't guess what which is interesting
00:24:25.60 --> 00:24:28.96 because you think well you know it's a military it's a military and if they get ordered do something
00:24:28.96 --> 00:24:33.20 no that's what they're talking about here that's what they're talking about it doesn't work like
00:24:33.20 --> 00:24:37.04 that doesn't work like that anywhere just because I bark in order you and I have rank over you
00:24:37.04 --> 00:24:43.76 doesn't mean you're going to do it especially if it's going to get you killed there's a comment here
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:49.92 and in these books they just they the sort of the authority times in the author whoever the author is
00:24:49.92 --> 00:24:55.20 the the author's chime in and they just write comment and it says comment a leader who is not
00:24:55.20 --> 00:24:59.84 gained the respect respect and confidence of his men during training has two strikes again and
00:24:59.84 --> 00:25:04.24 when he against him when he answers combat the element of doubt in the minds of his men
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:10.32 may be the difference between success and failure of a mission gaining respect and confidence
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:14.64 of your men how do you do that do you that by barking out of no do you that by yelling out of no
00:25:15.76 --> 00:25:18.56 you do that by listening you do that by treating them with respect
00:25:20.88 --> 00:25:27.20 here is a definition of discipline says Colonel E. L. Montz and Signal Corps true discipline is
00:25:27.20 --> 00:25:36.32 voluntary it is based on knowledge region a sense of duty and idealism a good leader
00:25:36.32 --> 00:25:44.40 develops in his men a cheerful and willing obedience that wants to respond that wants to carry out
00:25:44.40 --> 00:25:52.64 his orders this kind of discipline will in the end bring combat results as no other kind possibly
00:25:52.64 --> 00:25:59.60 can we could probably stop right here because everyone thinks when the military talks about discipline
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:04.24 they're talking about the what if you can beat your people into submission
00:26:04.24 --> 00:26:09.28 then you're going to be good to go no that's not the kind of discipline we're talking about
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.80 cheerful willing obedience that's a totally different thing willing obedience people want to carry out
00:26:18.80 --> 00:26:25.76 the orders you know totally different you don't really think of discipline associated with cheerful
00:26:26.96 --> 00:26:33.12 yeah you the context that they're using is military discipline is like hey do the does the team
00:26:33.12 --> 00:26:43.84 respond and execute what they're told to do with discipline right so in the context of that
00:26:43.84 --> 00:26:50.16 we there's multiple ways to achieve that one of them is by beating people that you're going to
00:26:50.16 --> 00:26:54.80 do this and you beat them and they're afraid and they're doing it out of fear the other way is
00:26:54.80 --> 00:27:00.40 they're doing it because they understand because they're part of it the result is the result is similar
00:27:00.40 --> 00:27:09.52 but what this guy is saying is that the one that will bring combat results like no other kind
00:27:09.52 --> 00:27:15.84 is the kind where it's a positive discipline yeah when they say it's a self imposed discipline
00:27:15.84 --> 00:27:25.84 we're doing this because we want to not because someone's barking at us this little section here
00:27:25.84 --> 00:27:32.40 it's a replacement instruction the wrong kind so in in in in world war two you had guys get wounded
00:27:32.40 --> 00:27:37.52 guys get killed and there was replacements coming in and so this happens inside all organizations
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:42.56 as organizations grow you got to bring a new people and as new people come in what happens to
00:27:42.56 --> 00:27:47.12 replacement orientation right this is like new hires how do you treat your new hires
00:27:47.12 --> 00:27:52.56 here's some things that they did it's called the wrong kind a lieutenant comments on his ominous
00:27:52.56 --> 00:27:56.96 introduction to frontline existence on my way to the front as an officer replacement I met several
00:27:56.96 --> 00:28:03.52 individuals who had come back from the front line invariably they recounted to me their hair raising
00:28:03.52 --> 00:28:08.72 experiences their outfits had been wiped out or pinned down for days officers didn't have a
00:28:08.72 --> 00:28:15.44 dog's chance of survival etc one puttune sergeant went statistical on me he said his puttune
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:20.40 lost 16 officers in one two week period I expected confidently that I would be blown to bits
00:28:20.40 --> 00:28:27.36 within 15 minutes after my arrival to the front went statistical on yeah that's what you know they're
00:28:27.36 --> 00:28:33.60 going hard yeah later experiences shown me that enlisted men who come in as replacements are
00:28:33.60 --> 00:28:38.48 subjected to similar morale breaking tales I've tried to get my old men to give the new
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:43.60 replacement a break by being careful not to exaggerate their battle experiences or in any way
00:28:43.60 --> 00:28:48.88 distort the picture of frontline existence give the new men a common sense introduction to the
00:28:48.88 --> 00:28:56.08 combat zone and there will be fewer men going on sick call before an attack noncombs and privates
00:28:56.08 --> 00:29:02.72 of company K 11th Infantry draw attention to the same problem our replacements come to us
00:29:02.72 --> 00:29:08.48 filled with tension and dread caused by stories they have heard in the rear special instructors from
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:13.12 the front should be used as at replacement centers to talk to the new men to talk the new men
00:29:13.12 --> 00:29:18.80 out of this unnecessary panic of course the soundest remedy is to have the replacements occupied
00:29:18.80 --> 00:29:23.28 defensive position for a time but even then the kind of treatment they are given upon arrival
00:29:23.28 --> 00:29:28.08 at the front makes a big difference in the amount of good they will do to their new outfit
00:29:29.04 --> 00:29:34.40 so how are we treating people at show up at your company and you can have such a huge influence
00:29:34.40 --> 00:29:40.96 if you do a good job bringing someone on board in a squared away manner don't screw it up
00:29:40.96 --> 00:29:46.56 comment company commanders and platoon leaders should meet orient and indoctrinated
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:51.60 all replacements so they gain an authentic picture of current battle conditions this should be done
00:29:51.60 --> 00:29:57.04 even though battle indoctrination has been started in replacement centers knowing what to expect
00:29:57.04 --> 00:30:03.92 even when the expected is bad is better than not knowing and consequently imagining the worst
00:30:04.88 --> 00:30:11.20 that's what's going to happen we're going to freak out and and part of this is I think on intentional
00:30:11.20 --> 00:30:18.48 when people tell stories right if you're to tell me let's say you were in a jiu jitsu tournament and
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:23.92 you wanted to tell me about something that happened that happened to you maybe you got caught
00:30:23.92 --> 00:30:30.40 negating and look your congregating and it was bad right and you got out of it but it was
00:30:30.40 --> 00:30:38.64 a crazy when you when you want to tell me that you want to make me feel how you felt and one of the
00:30:38.64 --> 00:30:45.20 ways you can kind of get closer is by making a little exaggeration but I started seeing I started
00:30:45.20 --> 00:30:50.80 the wall started coming in and it might not necessarily I understand what you're doing I understand
00:30:50.80 --> 00:30:54.32 why you're doing it but you weren't really going to get choked out you're just in a good
00:30:54.32 --> 00:31:00.56 guet teen but it wasn't good enough because obviously you got out so people can exaggerate for the purpose
00:31:00.56 --> 00:31:10.56 of of of giving the feelings that they had you know this mortar like I've been murdered before
00:31:10.56 --> 00:31:15.76 mortar hits mortar hits I don't know I don't know what the closest mortar to me ever was but
00:31:15.76 --> 00:31:23.84 maybe let's call it 20 yards or something like that so that's close bro that rocks your world
00:31:23.84 --> 00:31:30.72 you're like damn and if I'm just telling you this bro I got mortar I want you to feel like so I might
00:31:30.72 --> 00:31:36.16 be stupid I'm practically right on top of me it's 20 yards away bro yeah yeah you're right and if you
00:31:36.16 --> 00:31:40.56 don't kind of take a lot of times we'll take that personal you know like fine don't don't lie
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:45.60 don't lie to me and exaggerate like that you know like be accurate kind of thing but you can
00:31:45.60 --> 00:31:50.32 when you really think about it it makes sense because if you're like unless you're some if you got
00:31:50.32 --> 00:31:55.76 mortar like a thousand times you know when it's 20 yards you know oh you don't have to exaggerate
00:31:55.76 --> 00:32:00.72 to me because I know but you know most people yeah yeah if I was talking to someone else
00:32:01.52 --> 00:32:05.84 be like oh bro you've been mortar for oh yeah oh yeah I was over here oh yeah
00:32:05.84 --> 00:32:09.84 man this one landed close it was like 20 yards away you'd be like damn I don't need to explain it
00:32:09.84 --> 00:32:13.76 to you but if you don't know yeah exactly then I start making you know I start making it
00:32:13.76 --> 00:32:20.24 like a little bit well basically you want them to understand how you might exactly but because and
00:32:20.24 --> 00:32:23.28 they don't they don't have the capability to understand what you felt because they weren't there
00:32:23.28 --> 00:32:27.04 you know something you can imagine like oh yeah if I was there I do this like you have a
00:32:27.04 --> 00:32:33.28 misrepresentation of how it would actually feel in the situation that's natural exactly right but
00:32:33.28 --> 00:32:37.92 when you're in the situation yeah you can tell me I've never been mortar before and I know so
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:42.88 pricing but I haven't if you were like hey yeah we got mortar and it was crazy it was 20 yards away
00:32:42.88 --> 00:32:48.80 I'd be like I know how 20 that's not that close that's like I'd be all right oh yeah whatever that's
00:32:48.80 --> 00:32:54.32 like half of a 40 yard dash like that's kind of far yeah that's not scary at all but you know
00:32:54.32 --> 00:32:59.52 I get in what you explain it's not like that right you in that situation you're you think you're
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:04.32 gonna die or whatever you know but yeah so that's a natural thing if you're not in the situation you
00:33:04.32 --> 00:33:10.16 can't feel it you never can so let's sort of let's write it on top of us pro it's basically
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:13.92 get the standard of understanding up to where it needs to be for me to convey the story you know
00:33:13.92 --> 00:33:20.16 that's what we got to watch out for so we care for with that okay then it goes into the right kind
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:24.32 of orientation poor orientation of replacements may seriously affect the fighting ability and
00:33:24.32 --> 00:33:29.20 survival chances of men themselves and may also endanger the unit with whom they first serve
00:33:29.20 --> 00:33:33.76 for these reasons that leaders of putoan squads and companies should find out exactly what
00:33:33.76 --> 00:33:38.64 orientation and training have been given the men and should provide essential orientation on the
00:33:38.64 --> 00:33:47.52 spot in so far as practical before sending them into combat if a divisional training plan similar to
00:33:47.52 --> 00:33:54.08 that describe below is in operation the problem of inducting new members new men into smaller units
00:33:54.08 --> 00:34:00.32 is much simplified and lower unit orientation can be modified accordingly then there's an effective
00:34:00.96 --> 00:34:05.68 an effective training system described our division has received thousands of replacements since
00:34:05.68 --> 00:34:10.72 it first since it's first combat experience enormity more than 90% of these replacements have been
00:34:10.72 --> 00:34:15.36 infantry many of the replacements came into the division lacking confidence in their ability and
00:34:15.36 --> 00:34:22.80 paralyzed by the apprehension and gendered by loose talk before and upon their rival exact
00:34:22.80 --> 00:34:30.56 guys are scared shitless sometime ago we started a course of instruction for our replacements
00:34:30.56 --> 00:34:37.20 they last two and a half days and is conducted by battle experienced personnel particular emphasis
00:34:37.20 --> 00:34:43.92 is placed upon how to live in a foxhole development of an aggressive attitude the use of
00:34:43.92 --> 00:34:49.68 fragmentation grenade anti-takernade and bazooka throughout the course these men are trained in groups
00:34:49.68 --> 00:34:55.28 of 12 they are later assigned to organizations by these same groups you know what I'll tell people about
00:34:55.28 --> 00:35:02.40 is it close out here by saying we we found that this course of instruction gives replacements
00:35:02.40 --> 00:35:06.96 much greater self confidence it debunks the notions that they have picked up in the rear
00:35:06.96 --> 00:35:12.32 the course has definitely improved not only the morale but also the fighting ability of our
00:35:12.32 --> 00:35:18.000 replacements who expect to continue the plan for all replacements to come into the division you know
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.88 what else you gotta tell people is like oh you're gonna be nervous but it's okay you're gonna be nervous
00:35:22.88 --> 00:35:29.44 it's no big deal everyone's nervous no big deal it's fine that helps a lot because I've seen
00:35:29.44 --> 00:35:34.16 this with fighters they get nervous and they don't know what nervous feel like even a really
00:35:34.16 --> 00:35:38.48 experienced athletes that might have wrestled or they might have you know boxed or they might
00:35:38.48 --> 00:35:43.04 have done smokers they might even have a decent MMA record but now they're going in the UFC
00:35:43.84 --> 00:35:48.24 and they get nervous for the first time and they don't know what they don't know that feeling
00:35:48.24 --> 00:35:52.08 and all of a sudden they think it's bad yeah something's wrong and you gotta say hey listen
00:35:52.08 --> 00:35:55.76 oh you're feeling a little like queasy right now feeling some butterflies that's good
00:35:55.76 --> 00:36:00.80 that's your body putting your blood into your muscles instead of to your stomach it's all good
00:36:05.20 --> 00:36:12.56 common failings says a successful third army rifle company commander
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:18.88 the following failings are common among replacements they must be strictly and promptly eliminated
00:36:18.88 --> 00:36:25.04 if excessive casualties are to be avoided and combat efficiency obtained lack of ordinary discipline
00:36:25.04 --> 00:36:32.48 saying yeah instead of saying yes sir jumping at the sound of every outgoing or incoming
00:36:32.48 --> 00:36:43.04 artillery show we acted like we were like straight up nom like that's in a
00:36:43.04 --> 00:36:50.32 body like with the guys would show up and sometimes there'd be outgoing artillery from camp or body
00:36:50.32 --> 00:36:55.84 it's outgoing we like we're all this hard to work that's what's fun with that that's what
00:36:55.84 --> 00:37:01.36 I was gonna ask like is that a thing because like you know when you first encounter gunfire even
00:37:01.36 --> 00:37:08.48 if it's like you know the guy next year whatever shooting outgoing you know as we say it can
00:37:08.48 --> 00:37:14.64 startle you if you don't hear that all the time it's so loud so I'll be like this at the gun
00:37:14.64 --> 00:37:20.64 range bear with me I know so at the gun range you know when you first go in you start hearing
00:37:20.64 --> 00:37:24.80 the boom and then you know you got a little jump you know but after a while you go if you
00:37:24.80 --> 00:37:28.88 time do whatever it's like you don't jump at all but then let's say you take your friend and
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:33.20 say it's his first time or something like that first time long time whatever and you see him jump
00:37:33.20 --> 00:37:38.96 and then is that a thing like ah you jump you're kind of you know you're gonna get startled I mean
00:37:38.96 --> 00:37:42.96 you'll get startled but you do get used to it yeah fully but what I'm saying is let's say mean
00:37:42.96 --> 00:37:48.80 you go to the gun range somewhere or you know corn out or whatever and like boom you know
00:37:48.80 --> 00:37:53.28 shots fired whatever like down range or whatever and I like jump are you gonna tease me is that
00:37:53.28 --> 00:37:57.28 the culture you know kind of like like why are you jumping for you know kind of thing
00:37:57.28 --> 00:38:03.36 you're asking if I'm gonna tease you yeah answers yes that's kind of a universal thing
00:38:03.36 --> 00:38:12.88 yeah yeah but but you do get used to it but still like I startling noise but you get you get used
00:38:12.88 --> 00:38:18.64 I mean we shoot a tawn in the sealed teams oh yeah just like so much yeah it makes sense and again yeah
00:38:18.64 --> 00:38:25.52 I you know I haven't shot an a ton in the sealed teams but when I go to the range it's the same
00:38:25.52 --> 00:38:29.28 thing on a different scale where yeah when you first go in you're like boom or when like you're
00:38:29.28 --> 00:38:33.68 about to shoot in here the next you shoot you like oh you know you know did my gun go for whatever
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:41.76 it's like a joke so I hear so I hear that question I hear my gun my gun my gun this is not
00:38:41.76 --> 00:38:47.84 very reassuring but you know I just hear and then but then after a while it doesn't affect you
00:38:47.84 --> 00:38:53.04 it's no figure that's natural regardless of the environment you know did Jason Gardner tell
00:38:53.04 --> 00:38:58.56 that story on the podcast where the guy they were doing a debrief they're doing a debrief so
00:38:58.56 --> 00:39:06.64 Jason Gardner's like at T5 and they're doing a debrief after like a CQC kill house run or something
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:13.84 and this young officer standing there during the debrief and he just cracks off a round like
00:39:13.84 --> 00:39:18.64 during the debrief supposed to be cleared safe he cracks off around it goes between two of the
00:39:18.64 --> 00:39:23.92 guys they're standing in a circle and he cracks off around and the dude had like an out of body
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:31.12 experience and he looks up at the group and he says he was decarking it he says he was decarking
00:39:31.12 --> 00:39:36.32 it as if it was him that's one of my favorites stories from Gardner dude because that tells you how
00:39:36.32 --> 00:39:41.12 people get crazy they they do something and they think that it wasn't even there he's making
00:39:41.12 --> 00:39:51.12 excuse for a person that is someone else he was decarking it so there you go jumping at the sound
00:39:51.12 --> 00:39:58.000 of every outgoing or incoming artillery shell here's another good one stoner was stoner's
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.08 tasking it was going through CQC training and this guy threw a crash into a room and it like
00:40:06.08 --> 00:40:11.76 he threw a crash into the room and then went in the room and then like backed out because he
00:40:11.76 --> 00:40:15.20 scared the crash because it's something weird like that where the guy was basically scared of the crash
00:40:16.48 --> 00:40:21.44 and so stoner was watching and so stoner was like they get done with the run and so he was like
00:40:21.44 --> 00:40:28.32 hey come with me and stoner got like seven crashes in his pocket and he went into like a small closet
00:40:29.68 --> 00:40:33.92 and he goes and he starts talking to the guy all normal and like like hey you know I just want to
00:40:33.92 --> 00:40:38.32 talk and as he's pulling the crash out just like undoes it and pulls the pin and just drops it
00:40:38.32 --> 00:40:43.04 at their feet and continues talking totally normal just like oh man he does that seven times
00:40:44.08 --> 00:40:47.76 and then at the end of whatever he was saying to me goes hey by the way don't be scared of crashes
00:40:47.76 --> 00:40:53.60 they're not gonna hurt you oh man wait so are they what do you mean I mean okay they can't
00:40:53.60 --> 00:40:58.16 hurry got it but a crash just go bang I mean what you hold in your hand if you hold your hand
00:40:58.16 --> 00:41:02.40 it could hurt yeah yeah so he just didn't admit anything yeah it doesn't admit anything it's like
00:41:02.40 --> 00:41:06.16 a big firecracker basically yeah I mean and look you don't want to put a firecracker
00:41:06.16 --> 00:41:12.32 next to your hand or next to your eye but they're not gonna hurt you yeah I mean you crash each
00:41:12.32 --> 00:41:18.88 other all the time so I always thought that was a good lesson learned from stoner to that dude
00:41:19.76 --> 00:41:27.44 probably not great for his hearing but oh oh well unwillingness to use the rifle many
00:41:27.44 --> 00:41:34.08 have been told never to fire without direct orders for fear of revealing positions lack of pride in
00:41:34.08 --> 00:41:41.28 self organization or work poor physical condition a tendency to bunch together when in danger I
00:41:41.28 --> 00:41:47.04 wrote about that in leadership strategy and tactics not just from a battlefield but also from a
00:41:47.04 --> 00:41:53.44 mental status we all just want to like crowd each other we get we get we feel comfort being next to
00:41:53.44 --> 00:42:01.52 each other don't freezing under fire slavin slavinliness in care of equipment lack of skill with the
00:42:01.52 --> 00:42:06.80 rifle or other infantry weapons fear of the night ignorance of squad formations ignorance of
00:42:06.80 --> 00:42:13.76 field sanitation and of personal hygiene combat comment replacement to exhibit these deficiencies
00:42:13.76 --> 00:42:18.96 usually have usually not had the advantage of such training system as described above
00:42:18.96 --> 00:42:27.76 so think about how you're indoctrinating your people you can probably do a better job of it
00:42:27.76 --> 00:42:33.52 the next section is about river crossing as it goes by this whole this is these are tactical things
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:41.12 trying to help people win this war these are tactical things about literally how to cross rivers
00:42:41.12 --> 00:42:47.28 very cold a read I'm not gonna cover it right now it covers assault boat handling and water safety
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:52.08 and foot bridges and cable bridges and engineer bridges it just goes on all these detailed
00:42:52.96 --> 00:43:04.72 sections then it goes into this story about Roger Young and it's got a song that's got a song
00:43:04.72 --> 00:43:11.68 with musical notes that you can sing I'm gonna read you the the lyrics in first part of it oh
00:43:11.68 --> 00:43:18.16 they've got no time for glory in the infantry oh they've got no use for praises loudly sung
00:43:19.20 --> 00:43:27.04 but in every soldier's heart in all the infantry shines the name shines the name of Roger Young
00:43:28.24 --> 00:43:34.32 Roger Young who fought and died for the men he marched among so
00:43:35.52 --> 00:43:40.32 this story is about a metal of honor recipient and it tells a bit of the story here that
00:43:40.32 --> 00:43:46.64 that song is about this metal of honor recipient Roger Young on July 31st 1943 the infantry
00:43:46.64 --> 00:43:51.84 company of which private young was a member was ordered to make a limited withdrawal from the
00:43:51.84 --> 00:43:56.72 battle line in order to adjust the battalion's position for the night at this time private
00:43:56.72 --> 00:44:02.24 young Splatoon was engaged with the enemy in dense jungle where observation was limited the
00:44:02.24 --> 00:44:08.16 Splatoon was suddenly pinned down by intense fire from a Japanese machine gun concealed on higher ground
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:15.28 only 75 yards away the initial burst wounded private young as the Platoon started to obey the order
00:44:15.28 --> 00:44:23.12 to withdraw private young started creeping toward the emplacement despite a second wound he continued
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:30.64 his heroic advance attracting enemy fire and answering with rifle fire I'm close to his objective
00:44:30.64 --> 00:44:36.16 he began throwing hand grenades and while doing so he was hit again and killed private
00:44:36.16 --> 00:44:41.28 young's bold action in closing with this Japanese pill box and thus diverting its fire
00:44:41.28 --> 00:44:47.76 permitted his platoon to disengage itself without loss and was responsible for several enemy
00:44:47.76 --> 00:44:58.40 casualties like I said Roger Young was he received the metal of honor for this action and I looked
00:44:58.40 --> 00:45:04.48 up I looked up Roger Young it's an interesting story he was from a small town up in Ohio
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:09.60 to play it's called Tiff and Ohio and sometime during high school he was a really good athlete
00:45:09.60 --> 00:45:14.32 he was small but he was a really good athlete and sometime in high school he was playing
00:45:14.32 --> 00:45:23.28 an either basketball or football he got some weird injury some weird head injury that left him
00:45:23.28 --> 00:45:29.76 almost completely deaf and blind like he could see but not really well he could hear but not really
00:45:29.76 --> 00:45:35.36 well and he was worried about being able to get into the regular army so he joined the national
00:45:35.36 --> 00:45:40.88 guard and he was like a really good soldier despite the fact that he couldn't see very well
00:45:40.88 --> 00:45:49.68 and he couldn't hear very well and before this this assault in New Georgia and this island
00:45:49.68 --> 00:45:55.28 in New Georgia which is in the Solomon Islands before this assault he had been advanced in rank
00:45:55.28 --> 00:46:03.60 and he went to his leadership and requested a demotion because he felt like he was putting his
00:46:03.60 --> 00:46:07.44 guys at risk because he couldn't see well enough and he couldn't hear well enough and at first
00:46:07.44 --> 00:46:12.64 they thought he was just trying to get out of the you know he's just trying to not do this do this
00:46:12.64 --> 00:46:18.96 assault and he said no I'm doing the assault I'm doing the assault but I shouldn't be in charge of
00:46:18.96 --> 00:46:25.04 anyone because I can barely see and I can barely hear and they said okay Roger that they
00:46:25.04 --> 00:46:29.60 demoted him so he wasn't in charge of a squad anymore and he just became a rifleman
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:32.88 went out there and saved his guys
00:46:43.44 --> 00:46:45.44 next section's called patrol pointers
00:46:48.16 --> 00:46:54.24 commanders and staffs as well as troops should be made to realize the amount of detail
00:46:54.24 --> 00:46:59.76 essential to proper preparation of a patrol for each mission and precise the fact that the
00:46:59.76 --> 00:47:05.92 patrol leader must be given the means to end time to accomplish his mission how often do we actually
00:47:05.92 --> 00:47:09.92 think about what where it's tasking people with you got to realize what you're asking people with
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:13.52 what time it's going to take how much time they need to prepare for
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:20.64 contact with the main force leaders of flank and security or security patrols should be
00:47:20.64 --> 00:47:24.40 impressed with the importance of maintaining contact with the main force at all times
00:47:25.52 --> 00:47:31.04 loss of contact has often proved disastrous so you have to maintain communications
00:47:33.04 --> 00:47:37.76 the opposite extreme there we got a little dichotomy going here the opposite extreme however
00:47:39.12 --> 00:47:45.04 can also have serious results one patrol leader over zealous about maintaining contact
00:47:45.04 --> 00:47:50.08 cause the attack to involve the main body and develop into a major action for which the latter
00:47:50.08 --> 00:47:54.24 was not prepared so this guy kept everyone so close that by the time they did the assault the main body
00:47:54.24 --> 00:47:58.96 got caught up in the assault as well so there's a dichotomy you got a balance
00:48:02.80 --> 00:48:07.68 patrol leadership strictest discipline must be maintained during a patrol operation
00:48:07.68 --> 00:48:13.60 rigid control should be exercised to eliminate unnecessary noise talking sneezing and most
00:48:13.60 --> 00:48:21.68 important ill-advised firing all movement must be regulated to take full advantage of conditions such
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:28.80 as rainstorms temporary obscuring of the moon by clouds etc so this is what we got to remember
00:48:28.80 --> 00:48:35.20 when we say strictest discipline has to be maintained and control if you and I are in a patrol
00:48:35.20 --> 00:48:39.92 and you're in the back of the patrol and I'm the year of the rear security and I'm the PL
00:48:39.92 --> 00:48:46.32 I'm the patrol leader and I'm number two so there's 14 18 22 guys between us how do I control what
00:48:46.32 --> 00:48:52.56 you're going to do? I can't and if you see something that makes you nervous you can start shooting
00:48:52.56 --> 00:48:57.36 you know you might start making a call you might be doing dumb things why is that because you're
00:48:57.36 --> 00:49:00.88 dumb no it's because I'm a bad leader because I didn't explain to you what the parameters
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:04.24 were of what we're doing I didn't explain to you why we're doing what we're doing I didn't
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:08.08 explain to you the dangers of shooting your rifle if you weren't sure of what was happening
00:49:08.08 --> 00:49:13.52 so when they say control don't think of it like oh I've got to sit there and tell everyone exactly
00:49:13.52 --> 00:49:17.76 what to do you're going to really lose then what you have to do is you have to utilize
00:49:19.12 --> 00:49:26.16 powerful and and and well executed decentralized command that's what control is
00:49:29.12 --> 00:49:33.60 back to the book one patrol had almost completed its mission when its presence and location
00:49:33.60 --> 00:49:39.12 were revealed to the enemy through an unguarded movement by one of the members this betrayal
00:49:39.12 --> 00:49:45.52 nullified the entire effort of that particular patrol patience is of the utmost importance in patrolling
00:49:46.40 --> 00:49:53.12 that's true the success or failure of a patrol depends in the final analysis upon the
00:49:53.12 --> 00:49:58.56 qualities of leadership possessed by the patrol leader in most cases the commanders have selected
00:49:58.56 --> 00:50:05.28 their best officers and NCOs to perform in his duty leadership is what makes a patrol successful
00:50:05.28 --> 00:50:07.04 leadership
00:50:09.20 --> 00:50:13.76 organizing professional patrols this is an interesting combat concept some commanders have
00:50:13.76 --> 00:50:17.92 gone so far as to organize permanent patrol groups whose principal function is to furnish
00:50:17.92 --> 00:50:22.48 personnel for battle missions the officer selected for these groups are volunteers the most
00:50:22.48 --> 00:50:27.04 aggressive tough and rugged officers in the unit they are permitted to select from the unit
00:50:27.04 --> 00:50:31.92 men who possess the same qualities after a period of intensive training in scouting patrol in
00:50:31.92 --> 00:50:38.08 battle drill and physical hardening the patrol group is attached to the unit headquarters
00:50:38.08 --> 00:50:41.84 from which it receives its mission so he's talking look you can make a little element that's
00:50:41.84 --> 00:50:48.16 made of your best guys fatigue and strain and dirt by battle patrols make it impracticable
00:50:48.16 --> 00:50:53.12 to assign them more than one major mission every two or three days upon completion of a mission
00:50:53.12 --> 00:50:59.04 the men should be moved to a rear location fed rested and prepared for the next what I say is
00:50:59.04 --> 00:51:06.40 interesting about this is what do you have in your company that's a duty or a mission or a task
00:51:06.40 --> 00:51:12.40 that maybe it's such a such importance that you put together a little hit team and they get good at it
00:51:12.40 --> 00:51:15.76 and they do it all the time and you give them the support and you give them the training that's a
00:51:15.76 --> 00:51:20.000 very sensible thing to think about now it doesn't mean you have to exclude everybody else because
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.48 I can have a hit team of four people that do presentations to clients that doesn't mean
00:51:26.48 --> 00:51:29.36 I send two other guys you know occasionally I throw this guy throw this guy throw this guy
00:51:29.36 --> 00:51:34.40 so other people learn and maybe they spend some time in the hit team but it's an interesting
00:51:34.40 --> 00:51:39.60 concept and a good one to make someone a professional at that particular part of the duty
00:51:40.64 --> 00:51:43.92 I mean you're a football player that's like what football is right specialty
00:51:43.92 --> 00:51:47.60 essentially right yeah I mean it didn't used to be that way
00:51:48.32 --> 00:51:52.40 used to be like hey what we're gonna play football everybody's playing yeah we're just playing football
00:51:52.40 --> 00:51:59.36 yeah now it's like I'm only going out with this plays app that's an interesting way to look at
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:03.36 yeah only one this plays app yeah I mean there's some people I don't only play one play
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:09.28 yeah kicker kicker a wedge breaker something that can be kind of versatile
00:52:09.28 --> 00:52:13.84 yeah you're right specialty probably there is this guy actually he was a whiter seever but
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:20.72 what the heck was his name he played at you eight trade he was just well and he was a whiter seever
00:52:20.72 --> 00:52:26.000 for sure and he did some things or whatever but it was marginal compared to what his specialty was
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.48 was blocking field goals and puns he's on the outside because he could run real fast if that's got
00:52:30.48 --> 00:52:37.52 a team yeah he yes he had the instinct he was just so yeah the instinct and his speed he was a
00:52:37.52 --> 00:52:44.56 fast guy in the team so the way he could just like get his rod and rebounding yeah yeah
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:49.52 he was in his rod but I mean it's the scenario is a little bit different because it's not like
00:52:49.52 --> 00:52:53.60 they're like hey we need to call the rebounder you know then it's running and I was just playing
00:52:53.60 --> 00:52:58.72 okay some same but this guy hey they're about to kick a field goal a freaking what the heck was
00:52:58.72 --> 00:53:03.20 his name Matt oh man they're gonna be mad at me for not remembering that so this guy had good
00:53:03.20 --> 00:53:08.48 instincts to get that hand on the ball speed instincts you know what's weird about this is he must have
00:53:08.48 --> 00:53:14.88 been really good to actually be identified as that guy yep totally was he was famous for that so it was
00:53:14.88 --> 00:53:19.68 like the team was like kind of known for that like hey buckle up when we kick field goals or puns
00:53:19.68 --> 00:53:24.08 like this guy's coming so there was time they got to the point where they would stack that side wherever
00:53:24.08 --> 00:53:29.12 he was which is dangerous to do because you open up the other side for other guys but bro it's
00:53:29.12 --> 00:53:35.76 that important that's so good that's so good the specialized skill he had developed you know
00:53:36.56 --> 00:53:42.24 there's something to be said about this concept and specializing and focusing on something
00:53:43.60 --> 00:53:48.56 I was watching a thing about Wayne Gretzky and when he was like he would sit there and watch hockey
00:53:48.56 --> 00:53:54.88 games as a kid and while he was watching the hockey game he would trace the puck like with a pen
00:53:54.88 --> 00:53:59.60 on the on the on like a piece of paper like he draw hockey ring and then he would sit there and
00:53:59.60 --> 00:54:04.32 trace where the puck went where to go the whole time and then when the game was over three
00:54:04.32 --> 00:54:09.36 periods later he would look at the where his marks were on this piece of paper and start to think
00:54:09.36 --> 00:54:13.28 that's where the puck is this is where the puck is most time this is where I need to be
00:54:13.92 --> 00:54:19.28 and same with Dennis Rodman he would know where different shooters on his team what kind of spin
00:54:19.28 --> 00:54:23.68 they put on the ball and he'd be able to assess where that ball was gonna go where's the highest
00:54:23.68 --> 00:54:30.000 chance of that happening that's what he focused on so if you can do that with a team and you can
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.76 get a team focused on a particular item they're gonna excel at it it's a good concept and the
00:54:35.76 --> 00:54:40.16 comment here says the presence of a professional patrol group in a unit should not be considered
00:54:40.16 --> 00:54:45.20 a complete solution to the patrolling problem nor should it operate to curtail the training of individual
00:54:45.20 --> 00:54:48.64 riflemen and scouting of patrolling right this doesn't mean you got rodents and now no one else
00:54:48.64 --> 00:54:52.80 needs to work on their rebounding the professional groups should be used for difficult or
00:54:52.80 --> 00:55:00.000 special missions while normally normal with trying continues as well now this section that I'm about
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.48 to read this is kind of this is one of the ones where when I read these for the first time I was like
00:55:04.48 --> 00:55:11.68 this one's kind of it's a good debrief because it's a failure and they actually debrief a mission here
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:20.80 this section is called how not to patrol and it's got notes in it a six army report includes
00:55:20.80 --> 00:55:25.28 this account of an unsuccessful patrol action in New Guinea those some members of the patrol
00:55:25.28 --> 00:55:29.60 exhibited splendid courage and initiative the mission was not accomplished in casualties were high
00:55:29.60 --> 00:55:34.80 the negative results of this patrol action were doing large part to several violations of basic
00:55:34.80 --> 00:55:40.32 patrol principles as pointed out below a map of the area shown on the opposite page
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.72 so the terrain that they're dealing with there's a section on terrain the coastal flat northwest
00:55:48.72 --> 00:55:54.32 river there's a river and the way the river is broken out the rivers covered with
00:55:54.32 --> 00:55:59.68 kunei grass two to five feet hot feet high interspersed with wooded areas traveling as difficult
00:55:59.68 --> 00:56:04.08 and exhausting trees in the wooded areas are not close together but the underbrushes,
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:08.40 dense and visibility limited so you already know this is freaking horrible this is hard
00:56:08.40 --> 00:56:14.08 terrain to get through a track paralleling the beach is about eight feet wide and clear of underbrush
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:19.84 along the beaches of four to eight foot embankment suitable for cover against small arms fire from
00:56:19.84 --> 00:56:27.84 inland the width of the river varies from 15 feet in some places to 35 feet feet in others
00:56:27.84 --> 00:56:33.28 its current is swift the stream bread is rocky and relatively shallow except for the main channel
00:56:33.28 --> 00:56:37.44 which at the time of this patrol action was more than six feet deep as a result of recent rains
00:56:39.12 --> 00:56:43.92 so the way this is set up there's like this they're on an island they got the ocean
00:56:43.92 --> 00:56:52.000 it's a beach there's an outpost that's to the south end outpost a and then there's a river mouth
00:56:52.40 --> 00:56:58.96 and this patrol goes across the river to enemy territory and they've got these various locations
00:56:58.96 --> 00:57:04.48 a is the outpost and across the river you got this coconut plantation you got a perimeter that
00:57:04.48 --> 00:57:09.44 gets set up and you got a little village up there and they've got all these routes that go in and out
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:14.88 route k they take in route l one element takes out route and another element takes out so
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:22.88 there's a lot going on in this in this patrol and I don't want to get too wrapped around trying
00:57:22.88 --> 00:57:27.52 to explain like exactly what happened without the visuals but the patrol consisted of a rifle
00:57:27.52 --> 00:57:31.68 between reinforced by two sixty millimeter mortar squads one intelligence man a radio operator an
00:57:31.68 --> 00:57:38.08 eight man second lieutenant why the platoon leader was in command first lieutenant x from wise company
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:45.68 was attached to the patrol as observer and coordinator comment the higher commander keeps
00:57:45.68 --> 00:57:50.72 the accomplishment of the mission in mind when he selects the patrol leader the more important
00:57:50.72 --> 00:57:57.68 the mission the more careful his selection must be a good leader should have judgment initiative
00:57:57.68 --> 00:58:06.40 courage endurance and be a highly skilled leader the attachment of lieutenant x as coordinator
00:58:06.40 --> 00:58:13.04 not only divided responsibility but also indicated a doubt in the commander's mind as to wise
00:58:13.04 --> 00:58:18.32 ability to lead the patrol so you've got you've got this second lieutenant that's going out there
00:58:18.32 --> 00:58:24.000 in command but you put a first lieutenant with him it doesn't make any sense and that's what
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.44 they're that's what their common is you're kind of you're kind of throwing two people if you
00:58:27.44 --> 00:58:31.68 don't trust one guy to run the mission don't don't do it it's just a rifle platoon why
00:58:31.68 --> 00:58:34.80 you send in two officers out there do you not have confidence one of them and if that's the
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:41.12 case why you send in about there important thing to think about and what does it do to the minds
00:58:41.12 --> 00:58:46.96 of the troops hey we there's the boss cool oh wait now we got another boss wait a second why we
00:58:46.96 --> 00:58:55.92 get two bosses the mission the mission the patrol is across the river in vicinity of the
00:58:55.92 --> 00:59:03.84 battalion outpost reconwear to the coastal area south of this village and destroy any enemy
00:59:03.84 --> 00:59:09.12 found right so there you go but i'm gonna read that again the mission of patrol is to cross the
00:59:09.12 --> 00:59:15.36 river in the vicinity of the battalion outpost do reconnaissance of the coastal area
00:59:16.40 --> 00:59:22.56 and destroy any enemy found and it says here comment the mission assigned by the higher commander
00:59:22.56 --> 00:59:28.96 to the patrol leader must be specific and unmistakable indefinite missions invite confusion casualties
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:35.52 and failures one patrol cannot be expected to to execute efficiently a number of missions and by the
00:59:35.52 --> 00:59:42.08 way they're quoting field manuals for this that's FM 2175 reconnaissance patrols are used primarily
00:59:42.08 --> 00:59:49.20 to secure information maintain contact with the enemy or observe terrain they avoid unnecessary combat
00:59:49.20 --> 00:59:54.16 and accomplish the mission by stealth reconnaissance patrols engage in fire fights only when
00:59:54.16 --> 00:59:58.08 necessary to accomplish their mission order protect themselves so you see the dichotomy here
00:59:58.08 --> 01:00:02.80 we want you to re-conocense but we want you to destroy any enemy that you find that's two different
01:00:02.80 --> 01:00:08.40 things that's saying i want you to fight someone and run away from them at the same time
01:00:10.08 --> 01:00:15.04 a combat patrol executes missions which they which may require fighting to accomplish or to help
01:00:15.04 --> 01:00:21.44 accomplish every combat patrol secure information as a secondary mission then here's the comment
01:00:21.44 --> 01:00:26.56 this patrol had been given two primary missions reconnaissance and combat without any indication
01:00:26.56 --> 01:00:33.12 as to which has priority prioritize next to we need to know what the priority is the directive to
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:38.16 destroy any enemy found in the area if taken as the primary mission will preclude successful
01:00:38.16 --> 01:00:42.000 will preclude successful operation as a reconnaissance patrol the mission should have been
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.40 either combat with reconnaissance as a secondary mission or reconnaissance alone in which case the
01:00:46.40 --> 01:00:50.80 patrol would engage in combat only to the extent necessary to complete its reconnaissance mission so
01:00:50.80 --> 01:00:55.76 think about that when you're assigning someone a mission make sure they understand what the
01:00:55.76 --> 01:01:01.60 damn mission is and don't assign them two missions that are opposed to each other and when you do
01:01:01.60 --> 01:01:06.80 assign people two or three missions or tasks or projects make sure they know what the priority
01:01:06.80 --> 01:01:15.60 mission is what the priority project is the patrol departed out of the outpost at 10 15 leaving
01:01:15.60 --> 01:01:21.04 a 160 millimeter mortar squad to furnish fire support a rope secured of both banks were used to
01:01:21.04 --> 01:01:27.44 help put the patrol way across the stream by 11 15 personnel and equipment had crossed and
01:01:27.44 --> 01:01:32.96 we're waiting for scheduled artillery concentration before moving forward at 11 30 80 rounds of 105
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:40.32 was fired after completion of the artillery fire the patrol reconnoiided along the route to the beach
01:01:41.60 --> 01:01:45.76 except for the killing of three japs by the rear point no contact was made and the trip was on
01:01:45.76 --> 01:01:54.08 eventful okay at 1405 the patrol arrived at sea which is they they basically patrol from the
01:01:54.08 --> 01:01:58.80 outpost which is on the beach inland a little bit and to the north and then they get to the beach
01:01:58.80 --> 01:02:02.72 up north and they set up a perimeter that's the point sea that they're talking about
01:02:03.84 --> 01:02:07.44 for purposes of command and control the patrol was divided into three sections
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:14.08 consisting respectively of second lieutenant y and ten men the platoon sergeant and 13 men
01:02:14.08 --> 01:02:18.72 and first lieutenant x and 20 men so now we're dividing
01:02:22.40 --> 01:02:27.36 and the comment is actually command and control were not improved by this organization as was
01:02:27.36 --> 01:02:33.84 demonstrated later lieutenant y in addition to commanding the patrol was also commanding one of the
01:02:33.84 --> 01:02:39.84 sections lieutenant x as a loop as a section leader was now under the command of his junior lieutenant
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:46.48 so if you ever heard me say you probably have if you want to be in charge of everything you want
01:02:46.48 --> 01:02:49.92 to be in charge of nothing so when you're supposed to be in charge of a patrol and then you take
01:02:49.92 --> 01:02:54.48 charge of a section you're not going to be able to control everything you're going to be focused on
01:02:54.48 --> 01:03:00.64 the the squad or the section that you're leading so that's why you have subordinate leadership so
01:03:00.64 --> 01:03:04.24 they can look down and in and run that little element and you can look up and out and see what
01:03:04.24 --> 01:03:12.08 the whole team is doing together and you can mutually support each other and cover and move for each other
01:03:13.04 --> 01:03:17.44 at this time radio communications with the battalion commander at outpost was established
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.08 however radio soon went out did not function thereafter contact the first contact with the
01:03:22.08 --> 01:03:26.48 enemy came shortly after the reorganization had been completed about twenty japs with armed armed
01:03:26.48 --> 01:03:30.96 with automatic weapons attacked the perimeter from the southwest apparently this group had followed
01:03:30.96 --> 01:03:36.72 the trail made by the patrol in the brief ensuing scrimous teneming were killed and then remained
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:41.12 dispersed okay they do okay through that one patrol then move southeast along the coastal
01:03:41.12 --> 01:03:47.12 track toward coconut grove at b so now they were far up north in the perimeter now they start moving
01:03:47.12 --> 01:03:52.64 south towards this coconut grove when advanced element of the patrol reached the northwest edge
01:03:52.64 --> 01:03:57.76 of the coconut grove they received heavy machine gun fire rifle mortar hand grenade fire
01:03:57.76 --> 01:04:03.28 from their front and right flank so this is a bad scenario cross fire three members of the
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:07.92 patrol were wounded it was estimated that about fifty enemy fighters were in the grove
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:13.84 first lieutenant ex assumed command and because they had a fire order the patrol to return to the
01:04:13.84 --> 01:04:19.60 former beach at position c to the wounded man had been it had to be assisted after their arrival
01:04:19.60 --> 01:04:24.48 so now they go back to this perimeter that they had after their arrival at c the firing stopped
01:04:24.48 --> 01:04:28.88 and the temporary perimeter was organized so they they get back the regroup they got two wounded
01:04:29.52 --> 01:04:34.16 lieutenant ex finding them into closely grouped ordered two sections to move forward further inland
01:04:34.16 --> 01:04:39.20 neither section moved as far as lieutenant ex intended so he signaled them to move further
01:04:40.80 --> 01:04:45.36 so their inner perimeter lieutenant ex says hey push out from the perimeter a little bit they
01:04:45.36 --> 01:04:52.000 don't really move far enough so he gives him a signal to move further this signal was interpreted
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.40 to mean that the sections were to return to the river via separate routes as had been discussed
01:04:58.40 --> 01:05:03.76 earlier when the patrol first reorganized it see because both sections moved out leaving lieutenant
01:05:03.76 --> 01:05:08.48 ex by himself with his twenty men so now we have completely we have three different sections out here
01:05:10.32 --> 01:05:14.96 three different elements out there and you do not want to split forces in the first place and you
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:18.16 definitely want to split forces into three groups and you definitely don't want to split forces
01:05:18.16 --> 01:05:21.84 into three groups and you all wounded and you've already been attacked by a fifty man enemy force
01:05:21.84 --> 01:05:28.80 this is crazy the comment the patrol must be directed regulated and controlled at all times
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:33.52 patrol members must be familiar with all prescribed signals the leader may arrange for a few
01:05:33.52 --> 01:05:39.20 additional signals for special purposes in this instance and in this instance the loss of control
01:05:39.20 --> 01:05:45.04 can undoubtedly be attributed to the poor chain of command in the patrol organization to sudden change
01:05:45.04 --> 01:05:50.16 in command from lieutenant y to lieutenant ex while the patrol is in and contact with the enemy
01:05:50.16 --> 01:05:59.52 and to a failure to reach clear understanding of plans and signals you can see how these little
01:05:59.52 --> 01:06:04.08 compounding problems and if you look at your organization if you look at what you're doing inside
01:06:04.08 --> 01:06:09.52 of your business what little what little mistakes are you making what little what little things
01:06:09.52 --> 01:06:13.84 are you compounding what problems do you have that can be compounding that can lead to disaster
01:06:13.84 --> 01:06:20.80 is it communication is it chain of command are you not mutually supporting each other
01:06:21.68 --> 01:06:27.92 do people not understand what the mission is you see this applies to everything that we do
01:06:27.92 --> 01:06:34.08 with any kind of team the trip back the platoon sergeant with his 13 men followed the route m
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:40.80 so basically they all start going back in different directions they cross the river without incident
01:06:40.80 --> 01:06:46.72 and reported back to caught so they get back this first group of 13 guys gets back to the
01:06:46.72 --> 01:06:51.76 command post the battalion command post second lieutenant why in his ten men made it wider circuit
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:58.72 and they report back to battalion an hour later without having contacted the enemy
01:06:59.36 --> 01:07:03.68 okay so we're doing pretty good but first lieutenant ex realized that the other two sections
01:07:03.68 --> 01:07:07.44 had gone he proceeded to the river to another route and he's got the wounded guys
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:13.92 one of the wounded died and route the body was carried the section reached the one point on the
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:19.76 river without difficulty but found the point in the river that they got the river was 30 feet wide
01:07:19.76 --> 01:07:25.68 and the current was very swift and it would have been dangerous even for excellent swimmers
01:07:25.68 --> 01:07:30.80 and attempt to reach the original crossing site was unsuccessful because the enemy was in position
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:37.12 because the enemy would they try to go back where they originally crossed that's where they
01:07:37.12 --> 01:07:42.08 try and go back to and guess what the enemy is waiting for in there obviously they know how hard
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:48.08 it is crosses river they know the crossing points patrol should return from up this is comment patrol
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:52.96 should return from a mission over a different route to avoid ambush alternate crossing points
01:07:52.96 --> 01:07:59.44 could have been determined by reconnaissance before the combat patrol was sent out it appears that
01:07:59.44 --> 01:08:04.88 the enemy allowed the patrol to cross the river unaposed and planned to ambush it by closing in behind
01:08:11.28 --> 01:08:17.12 so now lieutenant ex goes back so they get they get fought away from the place where they originally
01:08:17.12 --> 01:08:23.36 crossed he sets up a perimeter anticipation of attack by the enemy a sergeant was then sent out
01:08:23.36 --> 01:08:30.40 with the mission of crossing the river and reporting to the battalion commander for help the next
01:08:30.40 --> 01:08:34.96 section is called the rescue meanwhile the battalion commander received a situation report from the
01:08:34.96 --> 01:08:39.84 leader of the section which returned acting upon this information the battalion commander had formed a
01:08:39.84 --> 01:08:45.76 group of 20 men and had proceeded to the vicinity of this island and this is another thing that screwed
01:08:45.76 --> 01:08:51.28 up and when you see it on the terrain where this element wants to cross over they're going to
01:08:51.28 --> 01:08:55.04 cross the river but they're going to cross on to like a little mini island where they'll have to
01:08:55.04 --> 01:08:58.64 do another freaking crossing but they don't know that because they haven't done recon.
01:09:02.16 --> 01:09:08.40 believing that this to be the balance of the patrol also so this group was preparing to cross the river
01:09:08.40 --> 01:09:14.40 to aid the remainder of patrol when they observed lieutenant wine his section crossing back
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:18.96 and so now the battalion thinks oh okay they're coming back now so we're good so they all go back
01:09:18.96 --> 01:09:23.92 to they all go back to the battalion and then the battalion figures out the battalion commander figures
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:29.12 out oh wait you didn't even bring back all the guys so two groups have come back but there's a third
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:37.04 group out there now the battalion commander's like trying to figure out what to do so he goes back out again
01:09:37.04 --> 01:09:40.88 and again this is the battalion commander this is a very senior guy going out to execute this rescue
01:09:40.88 --> 01:09:45.20 mission in order to evacuate and they link up in order to evacuate the wounded it was decided that
01:09:45.20 --> 01:09:49.84 a rope must be used several attempts by lieutenant extra cross the river with the rope or unsuccessful
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:54.96 finally but the battalion commander and four others grasp hands and formed a human chain out into
01:09:54.96 --> 01:10:01.52 the water lieutenant X removed his clothes and tied the rope to his waist from a point upstream he
01:10:01.52 --> 01:10:06.32 plunged in the river and was successful in reaching the hand of one of the men in the human chain
01:10:07.12 --> 01:10:12.32 as he was carried downstream by the current as the men in the human chain with the aid of others
01:10:12.32 --> 01:10:18.80 on the bank were pulling lieutenant X on the rope ashore an enemy machine gun opened up
01:10:18.80 --> 01:10:23.68 from the northwest bank although the rope was eventually secured on the island one man had been killed
01:10:23.68 --> 01:10:29.12 and five wounded including the battalion commander the wounded were evacuated to the outpost
01:10:29.12 --> 01:10:37.84 where the battalion commander died within an hour. Comment although his bravery was commendable
01:10:37.84 --> 01:10:42.40 the in invisability of a tying commander participating in a patrol action is obvious.
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:50.32 Subsequently, back to the event subsequently the enemy subjected the island to heavy machine gun
01:10:50.32 --> 01:10:55.12 and mortar fire however the men on the island this is that little island of the river however the
01:10:55.12 --> 01:11:01.20 little island the men in the island stayed in position to cover the crossing of the remaining
01:11:01.20 --> 01:11:07.44 17 men on the far bank one of the two wounded men with this group of the 17 was successfully
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:11.52 evacuated to the other was swept away and drowned while trying to cross.
01:11:13.60 --> 01:11:20.000 Of the 15 men only of the 15 remaining men only eight succeeded in getting across the river
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.44 before the japs closed in these men said they had been subjected to heavy mortar and grenade fire
01:11:25.44 --> 01:11:29.36 and it was believed that the others were killed. It's only eight of them make it.
01:11:30.24 --> 01:11:36.16 It is believed that all of the un-injured men in the group could have crossed the river before the
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:40.80 enemy closed in on them had they not chosen to stick it out in hopes of getting the wounded
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:45.60 across. So there you go these guys were brave they wanted to stay with their friends and they
01:11:45.60 --> 01:11:48.96 end up losing just about everybody because they're trying to get these wounded guys across.
01:11:52.08 --> 01:11:57.68 The comment the patrol cost a difficult obstacle and moved rapidly deep into hostile territory
01:11:57.68 --> 01:12:03.20 where the enemy situation was obscure. So start this whole this whole thing. You start off by
01:12:03.20 --> 01:12:08.24 going into enemy territory and in order to get into enemy territory you're going across a freaking
01:12:08.24 --> 01:12:14.48 river. We better have a damn good plan. We don't know what the enemy situation is up there
01:12:15.44 --> 01:12:19.92 and how deep are we going to go? Like you know what you're doing in a situation like that
01:12:19.92 --> 01:12:24.000 I call charge you put really good fire support on one side of the river and say,
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.20 guys you're going to go go cross go ahead. If something happens we got you. We got mortars we got
01:12:29.20 --> 01:12:31.84 heavy machine guns it will be able to get you back. And by the way we're going to put a rope around
01:12:31.84 --> 01:12:34.96 the first guy. So when you go across the river some happens we're going to pull you right back.
01:12:36.40 --> 01:12:44.96 That's covered move by the way. And then you don't go on a lengthy patrol without good support.
01:12:48.72 --> 01:12:52.72 There was apparently very little reconnaissance on the part of the patrol and it was unaware of the
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:59.12 enemy strength and the immediate vicinity. The patrol is of sufficient strength to fight its way
01:12:59.12 --> 01:13:05.12 out against the superior number of enemy but when control was lost and the patrol was disorganized
01:13:05.12 --> 01:13:11.04 and split up it was susceptible to defeat in detail. And just check this out. If you were on
01:13:11.04 --> 01:13:16.80 patrol with me and you saw me give you a hand signal like to go out set up a bit further push out a
01:13:16.80 --> 01:13:22.16 little bit further and you saw another hand signal with me from me there would be no part of your
01:13:22.16 --> 01:13:26.08 brain that would be thinking I would be telling you to split forces and go back to base. No part
01:13:26.08 --> 01:13:30.16 of your brain would think that you would know that I would that I would want to stick together. You
01:13:30.16 --> 01:13:35.04 would know that everyone would know that everyone on the team would think hey the only way we're
01:13:35.04 --> 01:13:39.92 splitting forces if Jockel comes over and looks at me and says hey we're splitting forces here's
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:45.92 the new plan other than that we're sticking together. That's like an implied commanders intent
01:13:45.92 --> 01:13:51.76 from me always. We are sticking together. We will cover move for each other for sure but we're not
01:13:51.76 --> 01:13:56.88 going to get separated where we can't mutually support each other that's not a good thing ever.
01:13:58.16 --> 01:14:03.68 So what kind of implied intent do you have with your team in your organization that people know
01:14:03.68 --> 01:14:12.000 what to do and they won't make mistakes like this? So essentially you're saying like for your
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.76 example where that's such a rigid rule that you have and it's established like that's kind of the
01:14:19.76 --> 01:14:27.20 Ethan like if if Lave heard me on the radio say that could split force. He wouldn't be like hey
01:14:27.20 --> 01:14:30.40 Jockel just told me to split force he back with something something's wrong. Yeah, I can't
01:14:30.40 --> 01:14:35.04 he would make sense to him. He'd be like okay hey Jockel say again hey Jockel I'm going to
01:14:35.04 --> 01:14:39.60 come and talk to you because if you're still you've never remotely said anything like hey let's split
01:14:39.60 --> 01:14:45.92 up and see how we do. Right. Right. Let's get to for me to say hey set up a good cover position.
01:14:45.92 --> 01:14:52.80 Cool all day long. Hmm. Provide cover moved to high ground. Any of those things but to say split forces
01:14:52.80 --> 01:14:57.76 it would be he would need to he would ask questions right and you're saying that's because
01:14:57.76 --> 01:15:01.76 there are certain things that are when you see he said implied right but there's certain things that
01:15:01.76 --> 01:15:06.64 are just this is what we're starting to let me tell you one of them is cover move. If you get
01:15:06.64 --> 01:15:11.36 it's cover move is what I live by it's a first law of combat right. First law of combat is cover
01:15:11.36 --> 01:15:16.64 move. If I'm telling you to go away from me we can't cover move anymore and life life here's
01:15:16.64 --> 01:15:20.24 that goes away. Second, Jockel doesn't want me to cover move that's crazy something's going on
01:15:20.24 --> 01:15:25.76 that I need to understand or it's a miscommunication. He's not like oh cool later. No if I
01:15:25.76 --> 01:15:30.32 elates one of the principles of combat leadership and it's not going to happen. Hmm.
01:15:31.44 --> 01:15:35.28 So what are those principles inside your organization? Do you have them established correctly
01:15:35.28 --> 01:15:39.84 that people know what to do and if a weird signal comes through they go away to say what are you
01:15:39.84 --> 01:15:45.60 talking about? This doesn't make any sense. You know like Dave Burke gets a request from a client
01:15:46.48 --> 01:15:53.28 and he built it. Yeah, you know and I say don't give the client any support. But if you would be
01:15:53.28 --> 01:15:57.12 you say wait a second no something's going on here. You know something's not clear there's a
01:15:57.12 --> 01:16:01.12 miscommunication because we are here to support our clients we're here to teach them leadership.
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.08 We're here to give them all the leadership tools that we can. And Dave knows that implicitly
01:16:08.08 --> 01:16:11.76 so if I will say don't give them any support. Wait a second I gotta go talk to Jockel
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:16.48 about there's something going on. Yeah kind of like if you lost your temper on somebody it would be like
01:16:17.12 --> 01:16:21.68 something would be. If you wouldn't yeah wouldn't compete. Really you'd be like oh that must
01:16:21.68 --> 01:16:31.36 be like a demonstration or something you know. Check. Before we jump this next section that section
01:16:31.36 --> 01:16:37.68 right there was the section that I kind of wanted to that kind of caught me because it's a very
01:16:37.68 --> 01:16:45.20 good debrief of a little you know you read about big battles and we've covered many big battles
01:16:45.20 --> 01:16:53.68 and of course we get the gist of the battle we get the experience of battle from one man's vision
01:16:54.48 --> 01:17:02.72 but to get it after action debrief like that and you can imagine how this is this is just a one
01:17:02.72 --> 01:17:10.32 little tiny example one little tiny example and and that's why when I when I started this thing
01:17:10.32 --> 01:17:15.76 often I said you know why do I cover these because I never heard these lessons every freaking
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:22.000 military leader should read that after action report where a bunch of guys get killed a bunch of
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.88 guys get wounded and why do you just have happened it's so clear why it happens they give you the
01:17:26.88 --> 01:17:30.88 reasons you have multiple chains of commands you have guys splitting forces there's unclear
01:17:30.88 --> 01:17:35.44 communication like you should know these things you should get taught these things
01:17:38.80 --> 01:17:43.20 and look what else you're facing out there you got your enemy right what else you got
01:17:45.04 --> 01:17:51.12 the river the river oh that's doesn't sound like a big deal but people drowned yeah
01:17:51.12 --> 01:17:55.60 this is not this isn't like a little stream this is a river where people drowned
01:17:55.60 --> 01:18:02.48 yeah and yeah and that's the kind of the assumption for us outsiders where you know we think
01:18:02.48 --> 01:18:07.84 okay they got you know they got this many guys on their side and we got this many guys but we got this
01:18:07.84 --> 01:18:12.08 and we got that like we have these tanks we got that you know it's like kind of nuts against nuts
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:18.96 kind of a thing but you consider not at all there's there's like we need food we need to get across
01:18:18.96 --> 01:18:25.12 that river yeah they're all this stuff that's kind of like jungle I'm just the jungle just getting through
01:18:25.12 --> 01:18:30.40 there yeah just what about our weapons they're getting you know sand in them they're getting
01:18:30.40 --> 01:18:36.24 water in them there's raining yeah we're we're our feet are rotting we're starving by the way
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:41.68 we need water we have this intrigued like what is going on yeah and by the way there's a bunch of
01:18:41.68 --> 01:18:49.04 Japanese suicidal fighters that want to kill us all yeah they're never saving private Ryan right
01:18:49.04 --> 01:18:56.000 where they kind of you know they they they they they come up on the beach and you know everyone
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.08 guys are jumping in the water whatever and then a couple guys they just drowned like it's like you
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:05.68 know when you you see that opening shot and you consider it in real life or whatever it's kind
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:10.88 of like okay what are we about to get into this is gonna be scary machine guns you know
01:19:10.88 --> 01:19:16.88 tricking Germans bombs all this stuff right but then oh wait a second what about the actual water
01:19:16.88 --> 01:19:24.56 we have to go through like that's gonna kill some of us and imagine this you go and you make a movie
01:19:25.76 --> 01:19:36.72 and you actually go into the horror and panic of each individual that jumps into the water with
01:19:36.72 --> 01:19:44.56 64 pounds of gear they're not a great swimmer they go to the bottom panicking fighting and drowning
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:51.28 and dying a horrible death and that's happening all over the place on that day and then meanwhile
01:19:51.28 --> 01:19:57.44 if you survive if you somehow get your shit together and get your gear off and now you get to
01:19:57.44 --> 01:20:05.52 the beach you're getting freaking strafed by enemy elevated bunker machine gun positions
01:20:05.52 --> 01:20:16.08 yeah check last section of volume seven is called OP and CP security
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:25.12 observation post and command post security this is such a good start it says even at this late date
01:20:26.32 --> 01:20:32.88 needless casualties delays and expenditures of effort are being caused by breaches of OP and
01:20:32.88 --> 01:20:37.28 security rules so what he's saying is like look we've been fighting this war for three and a half
01:20:37.28 --> 01:20:44.96 four years and even right now we have to explain what to do how to maintain security
01:20:45.36 --> 01:20:50.16 because we're taking unnecessary casualties because people aren't falling the proper protocols
01:20:50.16 --> 01:20:57.12 the inevitable results of of security carelessness are pointy illustrated by three following incidents
01:20:57.12 --> 01:21:07.28 carelessness cost lives cost lives reported by technician fifth grade earnest j-langie
01:21:07.28 --> 01:21:14.96 130 fifth infantry we stayed in one CP for two weeks without drawing a shell and it felt quite
01:21:14.96 --> 01:21:20.64 secure for we had been told that the enemy hadn't been shelling in that particular vicinity
01:21:20.64 --> 01:21:29.04 for the past thirty days however a few of the men either forgot or disregarded their instructions
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.08 they watched some white towels and shirts and hung them out the dry and effective signal for the
01:21:36.08 --> 01:21:44.000 enemy artillery fire upon our command post three of our men were killed in the shelling that followed
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:57.68 this breaches security learning security the hard way reported by an infantry battalion commander
01:21:59.44 --> 01:22:06.32 after being sheld out of two CP locations the first time with severe casualties we reorganized
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:13.20 a sadly depleted CP group and opened for business in another building a third story battalion
01:22:13.20 --> 01:22:20.16 OP and the same building could be reached only by passing a large open window on a stair landing
01:22:20.16 --> 01:22:26.48 since the entire village was under enemy observation and direct fire it was necessary to crawl
01:22:26.48 --> 01:22:34.32 past this open window to ensure that this would be done a century was stationed in the stairway so
01:22:34.32 --> 01:22:39.04 there's a window you have to crawl when you go by this window and it's so important that they put
01:22:39.04 --> 01:22:46.56 a guy sitting by the window going hey freaking crawl buddy hey you crawl all went well until it was
01:22:46.56 --> 01:22:51.12 discovered that the sergeant major had just covered the opening with a large sheet of tin
01:22:51.92 --> 01:22:58.32 so that the century could be released for work with the wire team so he needs the century to go do
01:22:58.32 --> 01:23:03.36 something else so he says hey just put the speed to tin up against the window this might seem like a
01:23:03.36 --> 01:23:13.12 weird question or maybe what's a century guard yeah a guard as opposed to like you could it's
01:23:13.12 --> 01:23:20.24 literally a guard is that like a rank like a position or someone like a guard guard tonight so
01:23:20.24 --> 01:23:26.24 now you're a century tonight like that you could you could use the word guard and century same word
01:23:26.24 --> 01:23:33.68 same okay synonym yeah the century might have a little bit more tone of military century as opposed to a
01:23:34.88 --> 01:23:42.48 guard of a prison so a centuries more like someone that's standing watch got you so what if you guys are
01:23:42.48 --> 01:23:46.64 out on a mission and it's like a two-day mission whatever and then it's like okay someone's got
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:52.16 to stand watch and it's jocco and you're a Navy SEAL straight up are you the century for that night
01:23:52.16 --> 01:23:57.76 kind of we think we would use the term watch like hey I got watch as opposed to saying hey you're on
01:23:57.76 --> 01:24:06.08 century duty in the in the navy you generally call it just watch so even hey who's got like in the
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:12.32 barracks I'll be like who's got fire watch or that you have watch because you stand and watch
01:24:12.32 --> 01:24:17.76 sections on the ship but technically you're a century but you're well like I said it's it's
01:24:17.76 --> 01:24:25.04 leaning towards well we would call century duty even in the in the navy century duty we'd probably
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:31.12 just call it watch but in other outfits probably some century yeah let's say you seem to be the
01:24:31.12 --> 01:24:38.08 yep okay so and you could put obviously this century was all he was doing was telling people what
01:24:38.08 --> 01:24:43.84 do hey get down when you go across that window so he wasn't actually protecting the perimeter
01:24:43.84 --> 01:24:51.44 he was protecting the troops from doing something stupid yeah it was a guard in a specific capacity
01:24:51.44 --> 01:24:59.52 there you go in the century so they put this big tin sheet up we abandon the CP and hasten
01:24:59.52 --> 01:25:04.24 moved to an already established alternate CP the only remaining location in town but last man
01:25:04.24 --> 01:25:10.40 had hardly left the building before was taken under direct artillery fire and rapidly disintegrated
01:25:10.40 --> 01:25:17.92 this incident thoroughly impressed our personnel with the folly of signaling OP and CP locations
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:23.76 to the enemy by altering the outward appearance of the building after occupancy that particular
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:27.44 error was not repeated they I just got lucky that thing and I bet someone was like great
01:25:27.44 --> 01:25:31.76 sergeant major what'd you do you put a piece of tin up do we got to get out of here you're an idiot
01:25:31.76 --> 01:25:35.68 sergeant major with all due respect you're an idiot and how the enemy knows we're here and we got to
01:25:35.68 --> 01:25:46.32 get out of here and the last the last section here one mistake is too many
01:25:47.84 --> 01:25:53.84 reported by the commanding general first infantry division officers this one is so important
01:25:53.84 --> 01:25:59.76 officers visiting the front line units should be warned against actions that might reveal to the
01:25:59.76 --> 01:26:07.28 enemy the locations of our installations in one case an observation post was located in a
01:26:07.28 --> 01:26:12.72 wrecked building inside walls of the rooms had been camouflaged to give a dark background
01:26:12.72 --> 01:26:18.16 instruments had been set well back in the rooms and observers were careful to move about only in
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:26.56 the shadows all went well until the day some visiting officers stopped by they moved about freely
01:26:26.56 --> 01:26:31.36 even leaning out of the windows and they're with their field glasses with an half an hour
01:26:31.36 --> 01:26:35.20 the building was completely destroyed by enemy fire one of our observers was killed
01:26:38.64 --> 01:26:43.36 that's the situation when you roll down to the front lines and you think you're just going to be cool
01:26:43.36 --> 01:26:46.72 yeah and in my mind I'm thinking I'm not even thinking that they were being stupid
01:26:47.60 --> 01:26:52.40 because they might just be being stupid but they might also be like hey I'm cool oh
01:26:52.40 --> 01:26:57.20 I'm not gonna hide I'm not gonna walk around I'm not gonna hide my shadows
01:26:59.20 --> 01:27:02.64 late late late's got a funny story about going to the government center for the first time in
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:07.84 downtown Ramadi and they like pulling the humbese and they see marines sprinting from one location to another
01:27:07.84 --> 01:27:12.88 you know like so they did just do what they were doing and like everything cool like yeah
01:27:12.88 --> 01:27:16.08 there's snipers around here you've got to move it you know like Roger that
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:27.36 but that that wraps up this this particular volume volume seven and you know that last little
01:27:27.36 --> 01:27:34.08 section it's these moments these little moments where we slack off where we get complacent just for a minute
01:27:35.28 --> 01:27:44.32 just for a minute and that's when we get crushed we can't let that happen we need to always stay
01:27:44.32 --> 01:27:52.96 on the path speaking of the path echo Charles is a day as one old record podcast speed
01:27:52.96 --> 01:27:59.04 it's good this book handle that some sections that I didn't cover because
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:06.32 look I find leadership lessons everywhere but when we're talking about using cable foot
01:28:06.32 --> 01:28:12.40 bridge to cross rivers I found a little bit it was really a stretch yeah it was really a stretch
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:17.84 I kept it to the leadership principles good so there we go all right how do we how do you stay
01:28:17.84 --> 01:28:23.52 on the path well part of this when you know only hear these accounts and go over these field
01:28:23.52 --> 01:28:29.04 manuals and learn these lessons from the past from books whatever it is important to even just
01:28:29.04 --> 01:28:33.60 remember to pay attention to the lessons because you can get caught up in the story man yeah like I was
01:28:33.60 --> 01:28:40.40 kind of concerned about those guys with guys human bridge link chain whatever I was concerned
01:28:40.40 --> 01:28:46.64 you know but there is a lesson that if you don't pay attention you might miss it so that's
01:28:46.64 --> 01:28:52.40 important too so yes we're staying capable for sure we're reading you know listening all that stuff
01:28:52.40 --> 01:28:56.88 we are reading I know I'm reading I'm not sure how much reading you're doing right now read
01:28:58.08 --> 01:29:03.76 either way for staying physically capable as well we're training I'll tell you that
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:12.40 nonetheless we've got to keep ourselves healthy and capable that's important I think concur
01:29:12.40 --> 01:29:16.08 so yeah so when you're on this path you might need some supplementation it helps
01:29:16.64 --> 01:29:21.68 oh it definitely helps yeah big time keep your immunity up keep your functionality up keep your strength
01:29:21.68 --> 01:29:29.68 up keep your endurance up keep your cognitive attitude up up yeah we'll be good time let it go down see
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:35.52 that's no good for nobody you got people depending on you including yourself so mostly yourself
01:29:35.52 --> 01:29:39.68 mostly yourself it's real good be my others I guess we can't have anyone relying on loss if we
01:29:39.68 --> 01:29:43.84 can't rely on ourselves that's what I'm saying that's what I'm trying to say what if you're at a
01:29:43.84 --> 01:29:49.92 capability two scenarios one you're at a capability health level 10 and then the other scenario
01:29:49.92 --> 01:29:57.84 you're at a health capability level five you got let's say two kids depending on you you got
01:29:57.84 --> 01:30:04.16 let's say maybe an employee depending on you maybe it has I don't know so someone else depending on you
01:30:05.60 --> 01:30:09.44 you want to be level five you want to be level ten let's face it that's not even a really good
01:30:09.44 --> 01:30:14.000 question well obviously answer right but that's but that's not the point that I'm making a point
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.80 I'm making is some of us we're just like I'm fine with my number five you're not doing
01:30:18.80 --> 01:30:24.96 nobody no favors by being at number five no at level ten you are doing a lot of people and there's
01:30:24.96 --> 01:30:32.32 a weird thing here some people would rather let let themselves down then let other people's down
01:30:32.32 --> 01:30:36.64 some people would rather than care about someone else but they would not want to let themselves down
01:30:37.44 --> 01:30:42.32 either one of those let's not let anyone down let's get that level ten and keep it
01:30:42.32 --> 01:30:47.60 see what I'm saying slipping off the path and not getting back onto the path is doing
01:30:47.60 --> 01:30:52.96 no good for nobody and you've got people depending on you you got to you got to do the right thing
01:30:52.96 --> 01:30:58.000 yeah let's do it all right yeah supplementation is far supplementation goes
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.20 jacquoise supplementation jacquo fuels called jacquo fuel jacquo dot com if you want to get it
01:31:03.20 --> 01:31:08.56 you have very reliable very high quality stuff this will keep you on the path this will help you
01:31:08.56 --> 01:31:14.000 straight up so first thing we will go into is discipline and discipline go supplementation for
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.56 your brain and body here's the thing the days of poison energy drinks which is the thing I get it
01:31:20.56 --> 01:31:27.36 I get it energy you know this thing but you got other bad stuff in there the days of drinking that
01:31:27.36 --> 01:31:34.08 can stuff art are gone no no no need nope not anymore it's a big deal now it the when you
01:31:34.08 --> 01:31:40.08 drink an energy drink now yeah it's good for you it's kind of like a smoke did the desserts right
01:31:40.08 --> 01:31:46.88 that's exactly what happened what the desserts is what discipline go does to energy drinks
01:31:46.88 --> 01:31:51.52 because let's face it you kind of like the taste of an energy drink you kind of like the fact
01:31:51.52 --> 01:31:57.36 that it gets you a little amped what you don't like is you crash what you don't like is it's bad for
01:31:57.36 --> 01:32:03.68 you what you don't like is it you get that freaking jitters and what you don't like is you're giving
01:32:03.68 --> 01:32:10.16 yourself type two diabetes which also sucks that there's no reason for any that no it's like dessert
01:32:10.16 --> 01:32:17.36 you know you you you feel like crap after you eat a big whatever if we can horrible dessert filled
01:32:17.36 --> 01:32:25.04 with sugar you know you just have milk yeah easy money yeah you you pay an additional cost for
01:32:25.04 --> 01:32:30.24 drinking an energy drink in a traditional sense you want to hear a non-traditional use of
01:32:30.24 --> 01:32:40.000 milk that I've been doing so I used to go to this restaurant and they did this thing called
01:32:40.24 --> 01:32:45.52 dessert shots have you heard this concept it's just a really small dessert yeah but it's kind of
01:32:45.52 --> 01:32:51.76 cool because let's face it you get done with a piece of big prime rib and a Caesar salad and you're
01:32:51.76 --> 01:32:57.12 kind of stoked but then you think I kind of want something sweet too but I don't want to get everything
01:32:57.12 --> 01:33:01.92 you know whatever big giant dessert so I'm just going to get myself a little
01:33:01.92 --> 01:33:06.08 little Sunday shot at this particular restaurant I used to go to back in the day which
01:33:06.08 --> 01:33:11.60 is close now unfortunately because it was a damn good restaurant me my wife used to go there
01:33:11.60 --> 01:33:18.08 and stone or would come like he would just show up with the third wheel just coming get it hang out
01:33:18.08 --> 01:33:25.52 all the time like every time but lately I've been doing like the same thing but I've
01:33:25.52 --> 01:33:30.24 been doing shots of moments just maybe a little bit bigger than a shot but just enough where you're like
01:33:30.24 --> 01:33:35.92 yeah you know like yeah that would work I think now I'll just keep a monk mixed up in the fridge
01:33:35.92 --> 01:33:44.48 oh yeah and just pour a little shot and just get a little hitter mix in some like dark chocolate chunks
01:33:44.48 --> 01:33:48.88 you need to get the like the smell of it on that yeah you put that in the shot so you like hit it
01:33:48.88 --> 01:33:54.08 and you can jump up the the dark chocolate and do a hitter nice I'm telling because those gourmet
01:33:54.08 --> 01:33:58.24 those dessert shots or whatever yeah I heard that you can get a little tray of them or whatever and
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:02.56 it's like yeah one's like a little cup of brownie or something they're just small right so you're
01:34:02.56 --> 01:34:07.20 saying so yeah you want to spice it up make it more like gourmet and lavish yeah let me tell you
01:34:07.20 --> 01:34:13.68 chocolate yeah I'm here to have a look at how bad it is also don't worry about the days of worrying
01:34:13.68 --> 01:34:19.36 about your joints just acting up those days are going to they are yeah I'm telling you stay on
01:34:19.36 --> 01:34:24.88 this thing the we got joint warfare mixed with a super krill oil don't kind of worry about that

01:34:30.56 --> 01:34:35.04 yeah which is an important thing maybe you don't think about it every single day but when you start to get

01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:58.24 jockel podcast material but they're adjacent material amplifying material we've talked about a bunch
01:39:58.24 --> 01:40:03.76 of psychology we talk about group dynamics we do talk about leadership we talk about and we and we
01:40:03.76 --> 01:40:09.52 be doing Q and A on there as well so the reason we have that is because we don't know what's going

01:42:48.72 --> 01:42:55.28 to win this argument with my publisher but I'm trying to get where it says first edition I'm trying
01:42:55.28 --> 01:43:00.32 to get it to say first edition and I know there's there's legal requirements about that page
01:43:00.32 --> 01:43:03.20 you know it's like copyright stuff so I don't know if I'm going to be able to get away with it but
01:43:03.20 --> 01:43:08.64 we're going to try and at a minimum it's going to say first edition it might even say first edition
01:43:10.48 --> 01:43:15.76 I've just finished the what they call first pass edits and you're just going through making sure
01:43:15.76 --> 01:43:20.64 that you know making sure that the edits are proper make sure that's all good to go and how many edits

01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:32.56 I'm reading it and I'm freaking loving reading it I'm like and I get the same thing I used to have
01:43:32.56 --> 01:43:38.56 this with the way the warrior kid where I'm reading it and I kind of forget that I wrote it because
01:43:38.56 --> 01:43:43.04 it's fiction so I didn't live it where you know when I'm reading the extreme ownership or leadership
01:43:43.04 --> 01:43:50.64 strategy tactics it's very much me right this is it's me that wrote it but you're kind of
01:43:51.44 --> 01:43:56.80 it's a story right that's in my head that's almost a different part of my brain I look it's
01:43:56.80 --> 01:44:01.44 obvious I think it's real obvious that it's me that wrote it you know I was on the
01:44:01.44 --> 01:44:07.36 Lex free you know Lex freedman yeah I just I just said a podcast with him and he said that I speak
01:44:07.36 --> 01:44:14.48 like Russian language like so however the Russian language is which you can kind of guess when you
01:44:14.48 --> 01:44:21.68 hear a Russian person speak English you know send location like that kind of thing he says that
01:44:21.68 --> 01:44:30.56 I speak English as if I'm a Russian human so that book is definitely written in a very let's say
