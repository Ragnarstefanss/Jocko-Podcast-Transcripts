00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 103 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening echo.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.20
Whilst lying at Windchester, young as I was in the profession, I was picked out amongst

5
00:00:16.20 --> 00:00:22.000
others to perform a piece of duty that, for many years afterwards, remain deeply

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.80
impressed upon my mind and gave me the first impression of the stern duties of a soldier's

7
00:00:27.80 --> 00:00:28.80
life.

8
00:00:28.80 --> 00:00:36.20
A private of the 70th Regiment had deserted from that corps, and afterwards, enlisted

9
00:00:36.20 --> 00:00:38.80
into several other regiments.

10
00:00:38.80 --> 00:00:45.80
Indeed, I was told at the time that 16 different times he had received the bounty and

11
00:00:45.80 --> 00:00:48.20
then stolen off.

12
00:00:48.20 --> 00:00:53.40
Being however, caught at last he was brought to trial at Portsmouth and sentenced by

13
00:00:53.40 --> 00:00:59.32
General Court Marshall to be shot.

14
00:00:59.32 --> 00:01:04.80
As the execution would be a good hint to us, youngins, there were four lads picked

15
00:01:04.80 --> 00:01:12.76
out of our corps to assist in this piece of duty, myself being one of the number chosen.

16
00:01:12.76 --> 00:01:18.000
Besides these men, four soldiers from three other regiments were ordered on the firing

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.52
party, making 16 at all.

18
00:01:22.52 --> 00:01:29.72
The place of execution was Portsdown Hill and the different regiments assembled must have

19
00:01:29.72 --> 00:01:36.32
composed a force of about 15,000 men having been assembled from the Isle of White, from

20
00:01:36.32 --> 00:01:41.80
Chai Sester, Gauceport and other places.

21
00:01:41.80 --> 00:01:49.40
The site was very imposing and appeared to make a deep impression on all there.

22
00:01:49.40 --> 00:01:55.88
As for myself, I felt that I would have given a good round sum, had I possessed it to have

23
00:01:55.88 --> 00:02:01.36
been in any other situation rather than the one, rather than the one which I now found

24
00:02:01.36 --> 00:02:03.72
myself.

25
00:02:03.72 --> 00:02:10.60
And when I looked into the faces of my companions, I saw by the pallor and exited, depicted

26
00:02:10.60 --> 00:02:17.40
in each countenance, the reflection of my own feelings.

27
00:02:17.40 --> 00:02:24.08
And all was ready, we removed to the front and the culprit was brought out.

28
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:30.60
He made a short speech to the parade, acknowledging the justice of his sentence and that drinking

29
00:02:30.60 --> 00:02:37.08
an evil company had brought the punishment upon him.

30
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:43.84
He behaved himself firmly and well and did not seem to flinch at all.

31
00:02:43.84 --> 00:02:50.36
After being blindfolded, he was desired to kneel down behind a coffin which was placed

32
00:02:50.36 --> 00:02:57.52
on the ground and the drum major of the depot giving us an expressive glance.

33
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:02.56
We immediately commenced to loading.

34
00:03:02.56 --> 00:03:10.04
This was done in the deepest silence and the next moment we were primed in ready.

35
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:15.88
It was then a dreadful pause for a few moments and the drum major again looking towards

36
00:03:15.88 --> 00:03:22.76
us, gave us the signal agreed upon before, a flourish of his cane.

37
00:03:22.76 --> 00:03:28.16
And we leveled and fired.

38
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:34.24
We had been previously strictly enjoying to be steady and take good aim and the poor fellow

39
00:03:34.24 --> 00:03:39.64
pierced by several balls, fell heavily upon his back.

40
00:03:39.64 --> 00:03:45.20
As he lay with his arms, pinion to his sides, I observed that his hands waved for a few

41
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:52.36
moments, like the fins on a fish, when in the agonies of death.

42
00:03:52.36 --> 00:03:59.96
The drum major also observed the movement and making another signal for of our party immediately

43
00:03:59.96 --> 00:04:05.88
stepped up to the post-rate body and placing the muzzles of their pieces to the head, fired

44
00:04:05.88 --> 00:04:10.52
and put him out of his misery.

45
00:04:10.52 --> 00:04:16.12
The different regiments then fell back by companies and the word being given to March

46
00:04:16.12 --> 00:04:18.60
past in slow time.

47
00:04:18.60 --> 00:04:24.48
When each company came in line with the body, the word was given to Mark time and then

48
00:04:24.48 --> 00:04:32.28
eyes left in order that we all might observe the terrible example.

49
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:42.44
We then moved onwards and marched from the ground to our different quarters.

50
00:04:42.44 --> 00:04:52.24
And that is from a book called Recollections of Rifleman Harris, who was an enlisted soldier

51
00:04:52.24 --> 00:04:59.44
for the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars and that was his welcome to the Army.

52
00:04:59.44 --> 00:05:07.44
He had been in for about three weeks of service when he had to stand and execute a fellow

53
00:05:07.44 --> 00:05:18.80
soldier for basically being drunk and disorderly, not doing what he was supposed to do.

54
00:05:18.80 --> 00:05:25.80
Essentially, he was being executed for being a human being.

55
00:05:25.80 --> 00:05:29.92
That was the introduction to military service for Rifleman Harris.

56
00:05:29.92 --> 00:05:33.80
Rifleman Harris's full name was Benjamin Randall Harris.

57
00:05:33.80 --> 00:05:37.68
He enlisted in 1803.

58
00:05:37.68 --> 00:05:46.56
He fought all over Europe in the peninsula war, which posed bourbon Spain, the kingdom of Portugal

59
00:05:46.56 --> 00:05:53.60
and the British Empire against Napoleon's French Empire and boat-apartists Spain.

60
00:05:53.60 --> 00:05:57.20
And also the Duchy of Warsaw.

61
00:05:57.20 --> 00:06:09.04
This is a war where they have daggers and swords and bayonets and mounted cavalry charges.

62
00:06:09.04 --> 00:06:19.36
They have cannons and they used a lot of muzzle loading rifles, which a skilled rifleman

63
00:06:19.36 --> 00:06:27.84
could load and fire about three times per minute, accurate out to about 200 yards.

64
00:06:27.84 --> 00:06:34.80
Very different from the weapons that we have now, which can fire three rounds in a second.

65
00:06:34.80 --> 00:06:40.96
And our very accurate out to 800 yards, a thousand yards and some sniper weapons way further

66
00:06:40.96 --> 00:06:44.60
than that.

67
00:06:44.60 --> 00:06:51.60
But even though these weapons are different from the weapons we see in modern warfare,

68
00:06:51.60 --> 00:06:57.80
as always in the end, it is men.

69
00:06:57.80 --> 00:07:08.40
It is human beings on the battlefield, bleeding, sweating, starving, suffering, killing,

70
00:07:08.40 --> 00:07:13.76
and being killed.

71
00:07:13.76 --> 00:07:24.32
This is a little bit more about riflemen, Harris, going back to the book.

72
00:07:24.32 --> 00:07:28.60
My father was a shepherd and I was a sheep boy from my earliest youth.

73
00:07:28.60 --> 00:07:32.88
Indeed as soon as almost I could run, I began helping my father to look after the sheep

74
00:07:32.88 --> 00:07:38.40
on the downs of blanford in Dorsetcher, where I was born.

75
00:07:38.40 --> 00:07:42.76
Whilst I continued to tend the flocks and herds under my charge, and occasionally in the

76
00:07:42.76 --> 00:07:47.52
long winter nights, I learned the art of making shoes.

77
00:07:47.52 --> 00:07:54.28
I grew a hearty little chap and was one fine day in the year of 1802, drawn as a soldier

78
00:07:54.28 --> 00:07:57.64
for the army of reserve.

79
00:07:57.64 --> 00:08:02.72
Thus without troubling myself much about the change, which was about to take place in

80
00:08:02.72 --> 00:08:09.52
the quiet of my routine days, I was drafted into the 66th regiment of foot.

81
00:08:09.52 --> 00:08:14.72
It did goodbye to my shepherd companions and was obliged to leave my father without

82
00:08:14.72 --> 00:08:17.56
an assistant to collect his flocks.

83
00:08:17.56 --> 00:08:21.84
Just as he was beginning more than ever to require one.

84
00:08:21.84 --> 00:08:30.12
Nay indeed, I may say to want tending and looking after himself, for old age and infirmary,

85
00:08:30.12 --> 00:08:32.20
we're coming on him.

86
00:08:32.20 --> 00:08:37.26
His hair was growing white as the sleet of our downs and his countenance becoming as

87
00:08:37.26 --> 00:08:41.18
furrowed as the plowed fields around.

88
00:08:41.18 --> 00:08:46.46
However, as I had no choice in the matter, it was quite as well that I did not grieve over

89
00:08:46.46 --> 00:08:48.42
my fate.

90
00:08:48.42 --> 00:08:53.66
My father tried hard to buy me off and would have persuaded the sergeant of the 66th

91
00:08:53.66 --> 00:08:58.90
that I was of no use as a soldier, from having maimed my right hand by breaking the four

92
00:08:58.90 --> 00:09:01.78
finger when I was a child.

93
00:09:01.78 --> 00:09:06.46
The sergeant, however, said I was just the sort of little chap he wanted.

94
00:09:06.46 --> 00:09:15.38
And off he went, carrying me amongst a batch of recruits he had collected away with him.

95
00:09:15.38 --> 00:09:18.22
She purter.

96
00:09:18.22 --> 00:09:21.86
Dad's getting old, army comes and gets you.

97
00:09:21.86 --> 00:09:23.86
That's the way it works.

98
00:09:23.86 --> 00:09:31.98
England, 1802.

99
00:09:31.98 --> 00:09:38.78
Now he travels around a little bit and eventually ends up in Dublin.

100
00:09:38.78 --> 00:09:44.14
Here we go back to the book, whilst in Dublin, I one day saw a core of the 95th rifles and

101
00:09:44.14 --> 00:09:49.22
fell so in love with their smart, dashing and devil-may care appearance that nothing would

102
00:09:49.22 --> 00:09:53.02
serve me until I was a rifleman myself.

103
00:09:53.02 --> 00:09:57.42
So on arriving at Castle One Day and falling in with the recruiting party of that regiment

104
00:09:57.42 --> 00:10:00.42
I volunteered into the second battalion.

105
00:10:00.42 --> 00:10:03.54
This recruiting party were all Irishmen.

106
00:10:03.54 --> 00:10:09.18
And I had been sent over from England to collect amongst others men from the Irish militia

107
00:10:09.18 --> 00:10:12.02
and were just about to return to England.

108
00:10:12.02 --> 00:10:17.46
I think they were as reckless and devil-may care, a set of men I'd ever been beheld either

109
00:10:17.46 --> 00:10:19.86
before or since.

110
00:10:19.86 --> 00:10:28.06
So these riflemen, I would say from what I read about them, they're almost like a special

111
00:10:28.06 --> 00:10:34.86
ops unit and one big difference is they're wearing red jackets like the Brits were

112
00:10:34.86 --> 00:10:35.86
wear at this time.

113
00:10:35.86 --> 00:10:36.86
They wore green.

114
00:10:36.86 --> 00:10:43.30
So they were a little bit different and they had more accurate rifles and they would fight.

115
00:10:43.30 --> 00:10:47.90
They would do what they called skirmishing which is fundamentally cover-move.

116
00:10:47.90 --> 00:10:54.34
They'd shoot and they'd maneuver and they'd act like little special operations troops out

117
00:10:54.34 --> 00:10:55.34
there.

118
00:10:55.34 --> 00:11:03.30
Of course it's interesting to me when I hear this guy talking about the first time he saw

119
00:11:03.30 --> 00:11:06.86
someone that looked a little bit like a special operations troop.

120
00:11:06.86 --> 00:11:10.90
He said, well he actually says, I fell in love with it.

121
00:11:10.90 --> 00:11:18.10
That's very much how I felt as I was growing up the more I saw the special ops.

122
00:11:18.10 --> 00:11:20.38
He didn't even need to be special ops for me.

123
00:11:20.38 --> 00:11:22.66
It was just someone in the military.

124
00:11:22.66 --> 00:11:25.50
Then he was already in the military, so now he's looking for the next thing.

125
00:11:25.50 --> 00:11:27.22
What's the next thing going to be?

126
00:11:27.22 --> 00:11:32.06
And here he ends up as a rifleman.

127
00:11:32.06 --> 00:11:34.14
So he's now a rifleman.

128
00:11:34.14 --> 00:11:38.74
He joins, he moves over to their regiment and here we go back to the book.

129
00:11:38.74 --> 00:11:43.18
The next day we marched for Ashford and Kent where I joined the 95th rifles and about six

130
00:11:43.18 --> 00:11:47.38
months after my joining four companies of the second battalion were ordered on the expedition

131
00:11:47.38 --> 00:11:48.86
to Denmark.

132
00:11:48.86 --> 00:11:55.10
We embarked at deal and sailing for hostile shores landed on a little place called I think

133
00:11:55.10 --> 00:11:57.30
Scarlet Island.

134
00:11:57.30 --> 00:12:01.50
The expedition consisted of about 30,000 men.

135
00:12:01.50 --> 00:12:06.74
And at the moment of our getting on shore, the whole force set up one simultaneous and

136
00:12:06.74 --> 00:12:12.70
tremendous cheer, a sound I cannot describe, it seemed so inspiring.

137
00:12:12.70 --> 00:12:17.46
This indeed was the first time of my hearing the style in which our men give tongue when

138
00:12:17.46 --> 00:12:19.98
they get near the enemy.

139
00:12:19.98 --> 00:12:25.82
The laughter words my ears became pretty well accustomed to such sounds.

140
00:12:25.82 --> 00:12:30.38
As soon as we got on shore, the rifles were pushed forward and we said the rifles he's

141
00:12:30.38 --> 00:12:32.46
talking about his guys.

142
00:12:32.46 --> 00:12:37.90
The rifles were pushed forward as the advance in chain order through some thick woods

143
00:12:37.90 --> 00:12:39.26
of fur.

144
00:12:39.26 --> 00:12:43.10
And when we had cleared these woods and approached Copenhagen centuries were posted on the

145
00:12:43.10 --> 00:12:47.42
roads and openings leading toward the town in order to intercept all commerce and prevent

146
00:12:47.42 --> 00:12:49.26
all supplies.

147
00:12:49.26 --> 00:12:53.66
Such posts were occupied for about three days and nights whilst the town was being fired

148
00:12:53.66 --> 00:12:55.98
upon by our shipping.

149
00:12:55.98 --> 00:13:01.22
I rather think this was the first time of the Kongrive rockets being brought into play

150
00:13:01.22 --> 00:13:03.50
and they rushed through the air in the dark.

151
00:13:03.50 --> 00:13:09.34
They appeared so like so many fiery serpents creating I should think terrible dismay among

152
00:13:09.34 --> 00:13:12.94
the besieged the Kongrive rockets.

153
00:13:12.94 --> 00:13:16.42
They basically looked like giant bottle rockets in a way.

154
00:13:16.42 --> 00:13:22.42
And they got at this time they were getting their range out to 1500 2000 meters.

155
00:13:22.42 --> 00:13:26.50
So it was a pretty crazy weapon.

156
00:13:26.50 --> 00:13:31.50
And I can tell you rockets in this day and age have become fairly accurate but in those

157
00:13:31.50 --> 00:13:37.42
days probably about as accurate as a bottle rocket is my guess.

158
00:13:37.42 --> 00:13:42.02
Back to the book as the main army came up we advanced and got as near under the walls

159
00:13:42.02 --> 00:13:45.90
of the place as we could without being endangered by the fire from our own shipping.

160
00:13:45.90 --> 00:13:47.62
So what's happening right there is cover move.

161
00:13:47.62 --> 00:13:51.62
The shipping is bombarding and these guys are advancing as close as they can where they

162
00:13:51.62 --> 00:13:56.70
are not going to get killed by their own fire from the ships.

163
00:13:56.70 --> 00:14:00.82
We now received orders ourselves to commence firing and the rattling of the guns I

164
00:14:00.82 --> 00:14:03.46
shall not easily forget.

165
00:14:03.46 --> 00:14:08.58
I felt so much exhilarated that I could hardly keep back and was checked by the commander

166
00:14:08.58 --> 00:14:12.70
of the company who called me by my name to keep my place.

167
00:14:12.70 --> 00:14:19.90
Throughout this time my front rank man, a tall fellow named Jack Johnson, showed a disposition

168
00:14:19.90 --> 00:14:25.86
as though the firing had a effect on him the reverse of what it had on many others of the

169
00:14:25.86 --> 00:14:26.86
company.

170
00:14:26.86 --> 00:14:32.90
For he seemed inclined to hang back and once or twice turned around in my face.

171
00:14:32.90 --> 00:14:37.02
I was a rear rank man and porting my peace in the excitement of the moment.

172
00:14:37.02 --> 00:14:42.38
I score that if he did not keep his ground I would shoot him dead on the spot.

173
00:14:42.38 --> 00:14:47.98
So that he found it he would go on so that he found it would be quite as dangerous for him

174
00:14:47.98 --> 00:14:51.02
to return as to go on.

175
00:14:51.02 --> 00:14:56.58
I feel sorry to record the warmth of courage of this man but I do so with the less pain

176
00:14:56.58 --> 00:15:01.10
it gives me the opportunity of saying that during my many years of arduous service it

177
00:15:01.10 --> 00:15:07.42
is the only instance I remember of a British soldier endeavoring to hold back when his comrades

178
00:15:07.42 --> 00:15:10.26
were moving forward.

179
00:15:10.26 --> 00:15:15.62
Indeed Johnson was never held again an estimation among the rifle corps.

180
00:15:15.62 --> 00:15:19.86
For the story got wind that I had threatened to shoot him for cowardice in the field and

181
00:15:19.86 --> 00:15:24.66
Lieutenant Cox mentioned to the Colonel that he'd overheard my doing so and such was the

182
00:15:24.66 --> 00:15:34.90
contempt the man was held in by the rifles that he was soon afterwards removed.

183
00:15:34.90 --> 00:15:36.30
There you go.

184
00:15:36.30 --> 00:15:43.10
First time under fire it's interesting how rifle man Harris first time under fire he wants

185
00:15:43.10 --> 00:15:44.58
to get after him.

186
00:15:44.58 --> 00:15:49.06
He is ready to charge and only one guy out of the whole crew is looking like he's going

187
00:15:49.06 --> 00:15:55.42
to hold back and they talk about reputation here and that's definitely something that

188
00:15:55.42 --> 00:16:00.14
is when you get to this heel teams as you're a new guy someone tells you they'll say

189
00:16:00.14 --> 00:16:07.14
your reputation is everything and it's totally true and it's the same in any military organization

190
00:16:07.14 --> 00:16:13.74
what your reputation is because in the military you think ranks all important right but

191
00:16:13.74 --> 00:16:18.14
the reality is there's something that completely trumps rank and that's reputation.

192
00:16:18.14 --> 00:16:23.38
And if you're I mean I always talk about the fact that relationships are more important

193
00:16:23.38 --> 00:16:27.74
than chain of command but you're not going to have a good relationship with people if you

194
00:16:27.74 --> 00:16:30.34
don't have a good reputation it's not happening.

195
00:16:30.34 --> 00:16:31.50
So make sense.

196
00:16:31.50 --> 00:16:36.18
Same thing back in 1803.

197
00:16:36.18 --> 00:16:37.18
Back to the book.

198
00:16:37.18 --> 00:16:43.70
Whilst in Denmark we led a tolerably active life the rifles being continually on the alert ordered

199
00:16:43.70 --> 00:16:51.70
heither today and counter-mandered the next occasionally also we had some pleasant adventures

200
00:16:51.70 --> 00:16:58.38
among the blue eyed Danish lasses for the rifles were always terrible fellows in that

201
00:16:58.38 --> 00:17:02.38
way.

202
00:17:02.38 --> 00:17:08.02
I think that doesn't need too much explanation.

203
00:17:08.02 --> 00:17:13.70
They I'll say this as I always say I have to fast forward through this book I'm not

204
00:17:13.70 --> 00:17:18.42
reading the entire book even though the entire book is awesome in this point this point

205
00:17:18.42 --> 00:17:27.46
here they're embarking for Portugal we have another another campaign to go on back to

206
00:17:27.46 --> 00:17:32.02
the book I wish I could picture the splendid sight of the shipping in the downs at the time

207
00:17:32.02 --> 00:17:37.74
we embarked with about 20,000 men those were times which are so which the soldiers of our

208
00:17:37.74 --> 00:17:41.46
own more peaceful days have little conception of.

209
00:17:41.46 --> 00:17:50.14
So this book was written before World War I and really this was the last big war is the

210
00:17:50.14 --> 00:17:54.02
wars that he went through the Napoleonic wars so he's kind of he's kind of saying you

211
00:17:54.02 --> 00:17:58.14
don't even know if this is like anymore you don't know what it's like.

212
00:17:58.14 --> 00:18:03.46
You don't know if the the the the soldiers of our own more peaceful days have little conception

213
00:18:03.46 --> 00:18:10.18
of what it's like to embark 20,000 troops to get ready to go get some.

214
00:18:10.18 --> 00:18:15.34
To the book we sailed majestically out of the cove of cork for hostile shore where we

215
00:18:15.34 --> 00:18:20.46
would safely arrived and disembarked at Mondego Bay.

216
00:18:20.46 --> 00:18:26.02
The rifles were first out of the vessels for we were indeed always in front of the

217
00:18:26.02 --> 00:18:32.70
advance and always in the rear in retreat like the Kentish men of old we claim the post of

218
00:18:32.70 --> 00:18:36.62
honor in the field I try to figure out what that.

219
00:18:36.62 --> 00:18:42.18
The Kentish men Kentish obviously a place and and the as far as the best I could figure

220
00:18:42.18 --> 00:18:48.98
out was that the people in Kent stood up hardcore against the Norman invasion and I think

221
00:18:48.98 --> 00:18:51.02
that's what that reference is to.

222
00:18:51.02 --> 00:18:55.66
I'm sure someone will correct me and I hope somebody does.

223
00:18:55.66 --> 00:18:59.90
Back to the book being immediately pushed forward up the country and advance the main body

224
00:18:59.90 --> 00:19:04.50
many of us in this hot climate very soon began to find out the misery of the frightful

225
00:19:04.50 --> 00:19:09.06
load we were condemned to march and fight under with a burning son above our heads and

226
00:19:09.06 --> 00:19:13.54
our feet sinking every step into the hot sand.

227
00:19:13.54 --> 00:19:18.66
The weight of the weight I myself toiled under was tremendous and I often wonder at the

228
00:19:18.66 --> 00:19:23.34
strength I possessed at this period that which enabled me to endure it.

229
00:19:23.34 --> 00:19:27.54
For indeed I'm convinced that many of our infantry sank and died under the weight of

230
00:19:27.54 --> 00:19:29.66
their nap sacks alone.

231
00:19:29.66 --> 00:19:35.94
For my own part being a handicraft, a handicraft I marched under the weight sufficient to

232
00:19:35.94 --> 00:19:39.98
impede the free motions of a donkey.

233
00:19:39.98 --> 00:19:44.82
For besides my well-filled kit there was a great coat rolled on its top my blanket and

234
00:19:44.82 --> 00:19:49.10
camp kettle my haversack stuffed full of leather for repairing the men's shoes together

235
00:19:49.10 --> 00:19:52.54
with a hammer and other tools.

236
00:19:52.54 --> 00:19:55.90
Ship biscuit and beef for three days.

237
00:19:55.90 --> 00:20:00.78
I also carried my canteen filled with water my hatchet and rifle and 80 rounds of ball

238
00:20:00.78 --> 00:20:03.26
cartridge in my pouch.

239
00:20:03.26 --> 00:20:09.30
This last except the beef and biscuit being the best thing I owned and which I always

240
00:20:09.30 --> 00:20:15.74
gave the enemy the benefit of when the opportunity offered.

241
00:20:15.74 --> 00:20:21.34
It's interesting he knew how to work on shoes and so he carries stuff to repair shoes

242
00:20:21.34 --> 00:20:22.34
in the field.

243
00:20:22.34 --> 00:20:25.66
Think about that that's just a lost art isn't it?

244
00:20:25.66 --> 00:20:30.50
Think about where you are in the field when you have to march 15 miles a day and you

245
00:20:30.50 --> 00:20:34.58
have no shoes if there's someone that can fix your shoes.

246
00:20:34.58 --> 00:20:37.78
That's a godsend.

247
00:20:37.78 --> 00:20:41.82
Back to the book the next day we again advanced and being in a state of the utmost anxiety

248
00:20:41.82 --> 00:20:47.06
to come up along the French neither the heat of the burning sun, long miles or heavy

249
00:20:47.06 --> 00:20:50.50
nap sacks were able to diminish our arguer.

250
00:20:50.50 --> 00:20:56.70
Indeed I often look back with wonder at the light-hearted style, the jolety and the reckless

251
00:20:56.70 --> 00:21:02.34
indifference with which men who were so destined and short time to fall hurried onwards

252
00:21:02.34 --> 00:21:07.22
toward the field of strife, seemingly without a thought of anything but the sheer love

253
00:21:07.22 --> 00:21:14.74
of meeting the foe and the excitement of battle.

254
00:21:14.74 --> 00:21:21.74
You wrote this book 20 something years after this happened after this experience.

255
00:21:21.74 --> 00:21:35.78
I want to say he wrote it in 1938 maybe is when it came out and you can see that so my

256
00:21:35.78 --> 00:21:42.06
point in saying that is that looking back he knows because he's going to go through hell.

257
00:21:42.06 --> 00:21:48.90
He's going to go through hardcore combat but even knowing how horrible combat is he still

258
00:21:48.90 --> 00:21:54.90
looks back and is amazed at how they were ready to go.

259
00:21:54.90 --> 00:22:00.10
Going back to the book the 29th Regiment received so terrible a fire that I saw the right

260
00:22:00.10 --> 00:22:04.90
wing almost annihilated and the Colonel I think his name was Lennox Lace sprawling amongst

261
00:22:04.90 --> 00:22:06.70
the rest.

262
00:22:06.70 --> 00:22:13.18
We had caught ourselves in it pretty hamptomly for there was no cover for us and we were

263
00:22:13.18 --> 00:22:14.82
rather too near.

264
00:22:14.82 --> 00:22:20.46
The living skirmishers were laying beside heaps of their own dead but still we had our

265
00:22:20.46 --> 00:22:24.58
own till the battalion regiments come up.

266
00:22:24.58 --> 00:22:31.58
Fire and retire is a very good sound but the rifles were not overfond of such notes.

267
00:22:31.58 --> 00:22:35.66
We never performed that maneuver except when it was made pretty plain to us that it was

268
00:22:35.66 --> 00:22:37.34
quite necessary.

269
00:22:37.34 --> 00:22:43.34
The 29th however had got their fairing hair at this time and the shock of that fire seemed

270
00:22:43.34 --> 00:22:46.78
to stagger the whole line and make them recoil.

271
00:22:46.78 --> 00:22:50.62
At the moment a little confusion appeared in the ranks I thought.

272
00:22:50.62 --> 00:22:55.90
Lord Hill was near at hand and saw it and I observed him come galloping up.

273
00:22:55.90 --> 00:22:59.82
He put himself at the head of the regimen and restored them to order in a moment there's

274
00:22:59.82 --> 00:23:02.06
some leadership just full on leadership and action.

275
00:23:02.06 --> 00:23:06.66
So there's also fire and retire what that means is cover move.

276
00:23:06.66 --> 00:23:10.66
So you have some people shooting and some people falling back that's how they retreat

277
00:23:10.66 --> 00:23:13.38
and they use that whenever they have to retreat you'll hear that.

278
00:23:13.38 --> 00:23:17.74
I don't know if I did this made this clear enough but it's a bugle.

279
00:23:17.74 --> 00:23:23.50
It's a bugle signal so the bugle would play some certain number of notes or some pattern

280
00:23:23.50 --> 00:23:27.38
of notes and everyone would know that means fire and retire.

281
00:23:27.38 --> 00:23:36.82
Now we get that broad that broad plan out to everyone at once which is instead of advancing

282
00:23:36.82 --> 00:23:41.70
which is what we were doing now we're going to retreat and as soon as you get everyone

283
00:23:41.70 --> 00:23:44.90
that information now little elements can start to make it happen that's decentralized

284
00:23:44.90 --> 00:23:48.58
command but you have to have good communications in order for that to work and what you

285
00:23:48.58 --> 00:23:52.98
need to communicate is the broad plan and that's what they get done with a nice little

286
00:23:52.98 --> 00:23:59.86
bugle signal back to the book pouring a regular sharp fire upon the enemy he gulred

287
00:23:59.86 --> 00:24:05.14
them in return and remaining with the 29th until he brought them to the charge quickly

288
00:24:05.14 --> 00:24:09.14
sent the foe in the right about.

289
00:24:09.14 --> 00:24:13.34
It seemed to me that few men could have conducted the business with more coolness and

290
00:24:13.34 --> 00:24:19.42
quietude of manner under such a storm of balls as he was exposed to.

291
00:24:19.42 --> 00:24:22.94
Indeed I have never forgotten him from that day.

292
00:24:22.94 --> 00:24:28.26
So it's important to also recognize that you have a group of men that are about to fall

293
00:24:28.26 --> 00:24:36.06
apart and there's confusion and one guy I talk about this all the time one guy steps up

294
00:24:36.06 --> 00:24:40.62
takes ownership of the situation leads and it changes the entire outcome of the battle.

295
00:24:40.62 --> 00:24:45.86
Think about that one person you got thousand men versus a thousand men one person makes

296
00:24:45.86 --> 00:24:46.86
the difference.

297
00:24:46.86 --> 00:24:49.54
So if you're in a leadership position think about that think about what you're doing.

298
00:24:49.54 --> 00:24:51.02
Are you leading?

299
00:24:51.02 --> 00:24:52.26
Are you stepping up?

300
00:24:52.26 --> 00:24:55.78
Are you galloping up on a horse and setting things right?

301
00:24:55.78 --> 00:24:56.78
Hmm.

302
00:24:56.78 --> 00:24:59.98
Collector, do you need to be doing it?

303
00:24:59.98 --> 00:25:04.54
Back to the book, at the time I was remarking these matters loading and firing as I lay.

304
00:25:04.54 --> 00:25:08.46
Another circumstance divided my attention for a while and made me forget even the

305
00:25:08.46 --> 00:25:11.42
gallant conduct of general hill.

306
00:25:11.42 --> 00:25:16.94
A man near me uttered a scream of agony and looking from the 29th who were on my right to

307
00:25:16.94 --> 00:25:19.34
the left once the screech had come.

308
00:25:19.34 --> 00:25:24.14
I saw one of our sergeants named Frazier sitting in a doubled up position and swaying

309
00:25:24.14 --> 00:25:30.22
backwards and forwards as though he had got a terrible pain in his bowels.

310
00:25:30.22 --> 00:25:36.06
He continued to make such complaint that I arose and went to him for he was rather a

311
00:25:36.06 --> 00:25:37.62
crony of mine.

312
00:25:37.62 --> 00:25:41.34
Oh, Harris said he as I took him in my arms.

313
00:25:41.34 --> 00:25:42.18
I shall die.

314
00:25:42.18 --> 00:25:43.34
I shall die.

315
00:25:43.34 --> 00:25:46.86
The agony is so great that I cannot bear it.

316
00:25:46.86 --> 00:25:50.18
It was indeed dreadful to look upon him.

317
00:25:50.18 --> 00:25:55.74
The froth came from his mouth and the perspiration poured from his face.

318
00:25:55.74 --> 00:25:57.86
Think heaven.

319
00:25:57.86 --> 00:26:04.74
He was soon out of pain and laying him down I returned to my place.

320
00:26:04.74 --> 00:26:08.90
Poor fellow, he suffered more for a short time that he was dying than any man I think

321
00:26:08.90 --> 00:26:12.30
I ever saw in the same circumstances.

322
00:26:12.30 --> 00:26:16.94
I had the courtesy to return and look at him after the battle.

323
00:26:16.94 --> 00:26:24.54
The musket ball I found had taken him sideways and gone through both groins.

324
00:26:24.54 --> 00:26:31.74
Within about a half an hour after this, I left sergeant Frazier and indeed for the time

325
00:26:31.74 --> 00:26:37.50
had as completely forgotten him as if he had died a hundred years back.

326
00:26:37.50 --> 00:26:42.94
The sight of so much bloodshed around will not suffer the mind to dwell long in any particular

327
00:26:42.94 --> 00:26:44.62
casualty.

328
00:26:44.62 --> 00:26:49.10
Even though it happened to one's dearest friends.

329
00:26:49.10 --> 00:26:55.50
There was no time either to think for all was action with us rifles just at this moment.

330
00:26:55.50 --> 00:26:59.98
And the barrel of my piece was so hot from continual firing that I could hardly bear to

331
00:26:59.98 --> 00:27:01.34
touch it.

332
00:27:01.34 --> 00:27:13.02
It was obliged to grasp the stock beneath the iron as I continued to blaze away.

333
00:27:13.02 --> 00:27:18.34
Doesn't even have time to think about it.

334
00:27:18.34 --> 00:27:22.70
James Panton was another crony of mine, a gallant fellow.

335
00:27:22.70 --> 00:27:27.06
He had pushed himself in front of me and was checked by one of our officers, rat for

336
00:27:27.06 --> 00:27:28.26
his rashness.

337
00:27:28.26 --> 00:27:31.38
He'd be back you, Panton.

338
00:27:31.38 --> 00:27:35.82
The lieutenant said to him more than once, but Panton was to be restrained.

339
00:27:35.82 --> 00:27:41.30
But Panton was not to be restrained by anything but a bullet went in action.

340
00:27:41.30 --> 00:27:47.38
This time he got one, which striking him in the thigh I suppose hit an artery for he died

341
00:27:47.38 --> 00:27:49.38
quickly.

342
00:27:49.38 --> 00:27:54.26
The Frenchman's balls were flying very wickedly at that moment and I crept up to Panton

343
00:27:54.26 --> 00:28:00.94
and took shelter by lying behind and making a rest for my rifle of his dead body.

344
00:28:00.94 --> 00:28:06.78
It strikes me that I revenge his death by the assistance of his carcass.

345
00:28:06.78 --> 00:28:10.66
At any rate I tried my best to hit his enemies hard.

346
00:28:10.66 --> 00:28:14.94
There were two small buildings to our front and the French having managed to get into

347
00:28:14.94 --> 00:28:17.98
them annoyed as much from that quarter.

348
00:28:17.98 --> 00:28:23.34
A small rise in the ground closed before these houses also favored them.

349
00:28:23.34 --> 00:28:27.82
And our men were being handled very severely in consequence.

350
00:28:27.82 --> 00:28:31.42
They became angry and wouldn't stand it any longer.

351
00:28:31.42 --> 00:28:37.74
One of the skirmishers jumping off, rushed forward, crying over boys over over.

352
00:28:37.74 --> 00:28:43.94
When he instantly went instantly, the whole line responded to the cry over over over

353
00:28:43.94 --> 00:28:48.86
they ran along the grass like wildfire, then dashed at the rise, fixing their sword

354
00:28:48.86 --> 00:28:51.18
bayonets as they ran.

355
00:28:51.18 --> 00:28:57.02
The French light bobs could not stand the sight but turned about and fled and getting

356
00:28:57.02 --> 00:29:01.98
possession of their ground we were soon inside the buildings.

357
00:29:01.98 --> 00:29:04.78
After the battle was over I stepped across the other house.

358
00:29:04.78 --> 00:29:08.30
I have mentioned in order to see what was going on there.

359
00:29:08.30 --> 00:29:12.82
For the one I remained in was now pretty well filled with the wounded, both French and

360
00:29:12.82 --> 00:29:17.22
English who had managed to get there for a little shelter.

361
00:29:17.22 --> 00:29:22.54
Two or three surgeons also had arrived at this house and were busy engaged in giving

362
00:29:22.54 --> 00:29:24.54
their assistance to the wounded.

363
00:29:24.54 --> 00:29:28.82
Now also here lying as thickly as in the building which I had left.

364
00:29:28.82 --> 00:29:31.38
But what struck me the most.

365
00:29:31.38 --> 00:29:36.78
But what struck me the most forcibly was that from the circumstance of some wine butts having

366
00:29:36.78 --> 00:29:41.46
been left in the apartment and having their engagement been perforated, having in the

367
00:29:41.46 --> 00:29:46.42
engagement been perforated by bullets and otherwise broken, the red wine had escaped most

368
00:29:46.42 --> 00:29:51.62
plentifully and ran down upon the earth and floor where the wounded were lying so that

369
00:29:51.62 --> 00:30:01.58
many of them were soaked in the wine with which their blood was minkled.

370
00:30:01.58 --> 00:30:10.90
I hate to even think about the medical care that these guys are getting and the medical

371
00:30:10.90 --> 00:30:16.34
care that we had in Iraq was unbelievable.

372
00:30:16.34 --> 00:30:23.18
Not only from the speed that you would get assistance but also the quality of care that

373
00:30:23.18 --> 00:30:30.50
you would get on in the field from our own medics and how quickly they would get you

374
00:30:30.50 --> 00:30:36.58
and then get you take care of and then get you evacuated to a full medical facility.

375
00:30:36.58 --> 00:30:40.02
And that actually changed during my time in the teams.

376
00:30:40.02 --> 00:30:41.90
For instance the biggest change.

377
00:30:41.90 --> 00:30:49.10
When I first got in the teams what we were taught was if someone got shot you immediately

378
00:30:49.10 --> 00:30:55.26
give them an IV meaning a bag of fluid because they're bleeding you got to replace that.

379
00:30:55.26 --> 00:31:03.06
And now they don't do that automatically because your body has its own mechanisms when

380
00:31:03.06 --> 00:31:05.50
it loses blood to stop the bleeding.

381
00:31:05.50 --> 00:31:12.50
It pulls back in the arteries and veins and it constricts them and it cloths the blood that's

382
00:31:12.50 --> 00:31:17.74
there and so when you give someone an IV the body thinks I don't need to do that so it

383
00:31:17.74 --> 00:31:21.10
opens up the arteries and opens up the veins it doesn't constrict anything it doesn't

384
00:31:21.10 --> 00:31:23.06
get cloths slower.

385
00:31:23.06 --> 00:31:28.38
So there's like one example and that's during my time so that's the last 25 years

386
00:31:28.38 --> 00:31:30.26
that that changed to stay in place.

387
00:31:30.26 --> 00:31:37.74
So now you go back you know a hundred and two hundred years it's totally different and

388
00:31:37.74 --> 00:31:39.50
they'll talk more about that.

389
00:31:39.50 --> 00:31:45.98
The basic the basic plan was if you get shot in a limb you're losing the limb that's

390
00:31:45.98 --> 00:31:51.02
basically what's going on just amputations.

391
00:31:51.02 --> 00:31:58.34
And nowadays they do an incredible job of saving limbs if they can be saved they save

392
00:31:58.34 --> 00:32:01.62
them I mean they do an incredible job.

393
00:32:01.62 --> 00:32:06.18
All right back to the book it was on the 15th of August when we first came up with

394
00:32:06.18 --> 00:32:12.62
the French and their skirmishers immediately commenced operations by raining a shower

395
00:32:12.62 --> 00:32:18.18
of balls upon us as we advanced which we returned without delay and I haven't said

396
00:32:18.18 --> 00:32:21.14
this yet but the reason they're saying balls and said around is because these guys are

397
00:32:21.14 --> 00:32:26.66
shooting balls with you round balls of lead and at this point there was some rifling

398
00:32:26.66 --> 00:32:32.50
head started to come about but what they basically just consider everything to be a ball

399
00:32:32.50 --> 00:32:36.50
of lead and that's why they're not accurate that's why they're only accurate out to 200

400
00:32:36.50 --> 00:32:41.38
meters because they're not rifled like we have the tight rifling spinning bullets

401
00:32:41.38 --> 00:32:43.90
today.

402
00:32:43.90 --> 00:32:48.50
Back to the book the first man that was hit was Lieutenant Bunbury.

403
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:54.54
He fell pierced through the head with a musket ball and died almost immediately.

404
00:32:54.54 --> 00:32:58.94
I thought I never heard such a tremendous noise as the firing made on the occasion and

405
00:32:58.94 --> 00:33:06.50
the men on both sides of me I would could occasionally observe we're falling fast.

406
00:33:06.50 --> 00:33:11.62
I do not pretend to give a description of this or any other battle I have been present

407
00:33:11.62 --> 00:33:12.90
at.

408
00:33:12.90 --> 00:33:17.74
All I can do is tell the things which happened immediately around me and that I think is as

409
00:33:17.74 --> 00:33:22.02
much as a private soldier can be expected to do.

410
00:33:22.02 --> 00:33:26.50
Soon afterwards the firing commenced and we had to take we had advanced pretty close

411
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:28.02
upon the enemy.

412
00:33:28.02 --> 00:33:32.98
Taking advantage of whatever cover I could find I threw myself behind a small bank where

413
00:33:32.98 --> 00:33:38.42
I lay so secure that although the Frenchman's bullets fell pretty thickly around I was

414
00:33:38.42 --> 00:33:42.42
enabled to knock several over without being dislodged.

415
00:33:42.42 --> 00:33:49.58
In fact I fired away every round I had in my pouch while slaying in this spot.

416
00:33:49.58 --> 00:33:55.70
At length after a sharp contest we forced them to give ground and following them up drove

417
00:33:55.70 --> 00:34:00.46
them from their position in the heights and hung up their skirts until they made another

418
00:34:00.46 --> 00:34:04.94
stand and then the game began again.

419
00:34:04.94 --> 00:34:10.38
The rifles indeed fought well this day and we lost many men.

420
00:34:10.38 --> 00:34:16.14
They seemed in high spirits and delighted at having driven the enemy before them.

421
00:34:16.14 --> 00:34:21.94
The most impressive coach was by my side loading and firing very industriously about this

422
00:34:21.94 --> 00:34:24.18
period of the day.

423
00:34:24.18 --> 00:34:29.10
Firsting with heat and action he lifted his canteen to his mouth, here's to you old boy.

424
00:34:29.10 --> 00:34:32.54
He said as he took a poll at its contents.

425
00:34:32.54 --> 00:34:38.26
As he did so a bullet went through the canteen and perforated his brain killing him in

426
00:34:38.26 --> 00:34:39.90
a moment.

427
00:34:39.90 --> 00:34:47.58
Another man fell close to him almost immediately struck by a ball in the thigh.

428
00:34:47.58 --> 00:34:54.10
I saw a man named Simon struck full in the face by a round shot and he came to the ground

429
00:34:54.10 --> 00:35:00.90
a headless trunk.

430
00:35:00.90 --> 00:35:05.74
When the role was called after the battle the females who missed their husbands came along

431
00:35:05.74 --> 00:35:13.46
the front of the line to inquire of the survivors whether they knew anything about them.

432
00:35:13.46 --> 00:35:19.46
The wives could travel with the soldiers and again it just seems crazy to me right now but

433
00:35:19.46 --> 00:35:22.38
that's the way they did it.

434
00:35:22.38 --> 00:35:27.70
Not all of them but if they made that decision I guess as a family to stick together they

435
00:35:27.70 --> 00:35:35.18
would get right on board the boats and they'd march in the book they didn't want

436
00:35:35.18 --> 00:35:40.82
to carry the weight but they'd march alongside and go from place to place and when the

437
00:35:40.82 --> 00:35:44.66
battles about to take place they'd hang back and then you have the situation once the

438
00:35:44.66 --> 00:35:47.02
battles over that I'm talking about right now.

439
00:35:47.02 --> 00:35:52.34
Amongst other names I heard that of Coach Ann called in a female voice without being

440
00:35:52.34 --> 00:35:54.26
replied to.

441
00:35:54.26 --> 00:35:58.82
The name struck me and I observed the poor woman who had called it as she said stopping

442
00:35:58.82 --> 00:36:04.58
sobbing before us and apparently afraid to make further inquiries about her husband.

443
00:36:04.58 --> 00:36:10.62
Oh man had answered to his name or had any given account to give of his fate.

444
00:36:10.62 --> 00:36:16.90
I myself had observed him fall as related before while drinking from his canteen but as

445
00:36:16.90 --> 00:36:23.58
I looked at the poor sobbing creature before me I felt unable to tell her of his death.

446
00:36:23.58 --> 00:36:28.98
That length capped in leech observed her and called out to the company does any man know

447
00:36:28.98 --> 00:36:30.70
what has happened to Coach Ann.

448
00:36:30.70 --> 00:36:37.06
If so let him speak out at once upon this order I immediately related what I had seen and

449
00:36:37.06 --> 00:36:39.50
told the man of his death.

450
00:36:39.50 --> 00:36:44.34
After a while this coat misses Coach Ann appeared anxious to seek the spot where husband

451
00:36:44.34 --> 00:36:50.18
fell and in the hope of still finding him alive asked me to accompany her over the field.

452
00:36:50.18 --> 00:36:56.18
She trusted notwithstanding what I had told her to find him yet alive.

453
00:36:56.18 --> 00:37:01.94
Do you think you could find it said captain leech upon being referred to?

454
00:37:01.94 --> 00:37:07.06
I told him I was sure I could as I had remarked many objects whilst looking for cover

455
00:37:07.06 --> 00:37:08.62
during the skirmishing.

456
00:37:08.62 --> 00:37:13.46
Go then said the captain and show the poor woman the spot as she seemed so desireless

457
00:37:13.46 --> 00:37:16.18
of finding the body.

458
00:37:16.18 --> 00:37:20.82
I accordingly took my way over the ground we had fought upon she following and sobbing

459
00:37:20.82 --> 00:37:27.78
after me quickly reaching the spot where her husband's body lay pointed out to her.

460
00:37:27.78 --> 00:37:32.78
She now discovered soon all her hopes were in vain.

461
00:37:32.78 --> 00:37:38.90
She embraced a stiffened corpse and after rising and contemplating his disfigured face

462
00:37:38.90 --> 00:37:44.86
for some minutes with hands clasped and tears streaming down her cheeks she took a prayer

463
00:37:44.86 --> 00:37:53.22
book from her pocket and kneeling down repeated the service for the dead over the body.

464
00:37:53.22 --> 00:37:55.22
Poor woman.

465
00:37:55.22 --> 00:38:05.46
I pity her much but there was no remedy.

466
00:38:05.46 --> 00:38:17.42
I told her I was a little bit more nervous than I thought.

467
00:38:17.42 --> 00:38:23.90
The French came down upon us as a column and the rifleman immediately commenced

468
00:38:23.90 --> 00:38:27.98
to sharp fire upon them from whatever cover they could get a shelter behind whilst

469
00:38:27.98 --> 00:38:31.22
our cannon played upon them from our rear.

470
00:38:31.22 --> 00:38:36.62
I saw regular lanes torn through their ranks as they advanced which were immediately

471
00:38:36.62 --> 00:38:40.50
closed up again as they marched steadily on.

472
00:38:40.50 --> 00:38:46.86
Whenever we saw round shot, thus go through the mass we raised a shout of delight.

473
00:38:46.86 --> 00:38:52.18
That's a savage image right there ranks of men and there's cannon balls that are cutting

474
00:38:52.18 --> 00:38:56.10
lines through cutting lanes through them.

475
00:38:56.10 --> 00:39:02.94
You probably talking 20, 30 people killed each one and the ranks just closing around them.

476
00:39:02.94 --> 00:39:07.30
That's what these guys are seeing as this advanced takes place.

477
00:39:07.30 --> 00:39:09.82
They're continue through that battle.

478
00:39:09.82 --> 00:39:12.66
They get into a position for another battle.

479
00:39:12.66 --> 00:39:17.26
Going back to the book as I looked about me while standing and ranked and just thought

480
00:39:17.26 --> 00:39:22.14
and just before the commencement of the battle, I thought it the most imposing sight

481
00:39:22.14 --> 00:39:24.90
the world could produce.

482
00:39:24.90 --> 00:39:29.78
Our lines glittering with bright arms, the stern features of the men as they stood with

483
00:39:29.78 --> 00:39:35.34
their eyes fixed on alterably upon the enemy, the proud colors of England floating over

484
00:39:35.34 --> 00:39:41.22
the heads of the different battalions and the dark cannon on the rising ground and all

485
00:39:41.22 --> 00:39:47.26
in readiness to commence the awful work of death with a noise that would defen the whole

486
00:39:47.26 --> 00:39:49.86
multitude.

487
00:39:49.86 --> 00:39:55.26
Although the sight had a singular and terrible effect upon the feelings of a youth who,

488
00:39:55.26 --> 00:40:01.82
a few short months before, had been a solitary shepherd upon the downs of door-sature

489
00:40:01.82 --> 00:40:07.86
and had never contemplated any other sort of life than the peaceful occupation of watching

490
00:40:07.86 --> 00:40:13.82
the innocent sheep as they fed upon the grassy turf.

491
00:40:13.82 --> 00:40:15.18
Talk about a dichotomy.

492
00:40:15.18 --> 00:40:22.18
Yeah. No fought in his mind other than watching sheep eat grass.

493
00:40:22.18 --> 00:40:28.90
I would think that that would be kind of a good little escape, you know, from time to time

494
00:40:28.90 --> 00:40:31.50
to notice those types of things.

495
00:40:31.50 --> 00:40:38.94
Yes, I think you're right and I think that happens and there's a movie called the Finn Redline

496
00:40:38.94 --> 00:40:41.46
and that's portrayed very well.

497
00:40:41.46 --> 00:40:46.70
And all this chaos, he'll take cover and he'll be face to face with a flower or he'll

498
00:40:46.70 --> 00:40:51.82
notice a bird or a bug and that's definitely something that people notice.

499
00:40:51.82 --> 00:40:56.42
I mean, I noticed there's this sunset no matter where you are in the world and actually

500
00:40:56.42 --> 00:41:01.18
there's sunset in the desert, it's a very beautiful thing and same with the sunrise.

501
00:41:01.18 --> 00:41:05.94
And so those are little things that you notice even though you might not be in the mindset

502
00:41:05.94 --> 00:41:11.42
to notice them, you still notice them.

503
00:41:11.42 --> 00:41:16.86
Back to the book, the battle commencing immediately, we were all soon hard at work.

504
00:41:16.86 --> 00:41:19.82
The rifles as usual were pretty busy in this battle.

505
00:41:19.82 --> 00:41:24.90
The French and Great Numbers came steadily down upon us and we peltered away upon them

506
00:41:24.90 --> 00:41:27.90
like a shower of lead and hail.

507
00:41:27.90 --> 00:41:32.74
Under any cover we could find and lay, firing one moment jumping up and running for at

508
00:41:32.74 --> 00:41:34.06
the next.

509
00:41:34.06 --> 00:41:38.46
And when we could see before us, we observed the cannonballs making a lane through the

510
00:41:38.46 --> 00:41:48.66
enemy's columns as they advanced as they were, hosying and shouting like madmen.

511
00:41:48.66 --> 00:41:54.90
The battle soon became general, the smoke thickened around and often I was obliged to stop

512
00:41:54.90 --> 00:41:59.34
firing and dash it aside from my face and try and vain to get a sight of what was going

513
00:41:59.34 --> 00:42:05.02
on whilst groans and shouts and an oys of cannon and muscatory appeared almost to shake

514
00:42:05.02 --> 00:42:07.66
the very ground.

515
00:42:07.66 --> 00:42:10.94
It seemed hell upon or if I thought.

516
00:42:10.94 --> 00:42:16.86
A man named John Low stood before me at this moment and he turned round during a pause

517
00:42:16.86 --> 00:42:20.74
in our exertions, then he addressed me, Harris, you humbug?

518
00:42:20.74 --> 00:42:24.78
He said, you've got plenty of money about you, I know, for you don't always staying

519
00:42:24.78 --> 00:42:27.74
about and picking up what you can find on the field.

520
00:42:27.74 --> 00:42:30.78
But I think this will be your last field, Dale, boy.

521
00:42:30.78 --> 00:42:34.50
A good many of us will catch it, I suspect today.

522
00:42:34.50 --> 00:42:40.30
The right low I said, I've got nine guinea's in my pack and if I am shot today and you

523
00:42:40.30 --> 00:42:47.90
escape yourself, it's quite at your service in the meantime, however, if you see any symptoms

524
00:42:47.90 --> 00:42:55.78
of my wishing to flinch in this business, I hope you will shoot me with your own hand.

525
00:42:55.78 --> 00:42:56.78
Low.

526
00:42:56.78 --> 00:42:58.62
So let's think about that.

527
00:42:58.62 --> 00:43:00.02
That's pretty awesome.

528
00:43:00.02 --> 00:43:04.78
Well, the attitude of they're basically talking smack to each other.

529
00:43:04.78 --> 00:43:05.78
Classic.

530
00:43:05.78 --> 00:43:06.78
Hey, I don't think you're going to make it.

531
00:43:06.78 --> 00:43:10.10
I know you got a lot of money on you and if you don't make it, what do you say?

532
00:43:10.10 --> 00:43:11.10
Is that mine?

533
00:43:11.10 --> 00:43:13.26
Yes, if I die, come and get it.

534
00:43:13.26 --> 00:43:14.62
I got nine guinea's in my pack.

535
00:43:14.62 --> 00:43:16.10
They're all yours.

536
00:43:16.10 --> 00:43:17.54
And then this is classic.

537
00:43:17.54 --> 00:43:23.14
By the way, if you see me acting cowardly in any way, you better shoot me.

538
00:43:23.14 --> 00:43:26.14
Yeah, it's legit.

539
00:43:26.14 --> 00:43:28.62
Low as well as myself survived this battle.

540
00:43:28.62 --> 00:43:34.14
And after it was over, whilst we sat down with our comrades and rested amongst other matters,

541
00:43:34.14 --> 00:43:38.66
talked over, low told them of our conversation during the heat of the day, and the money

542
00:43:38.66 --> 00:43:43.66
I'd collected, and the rifles from that time to time had a great respect for me.

543
00:43:43.66 --> 00:43:50.14
It is indeed singular how a man loses or gains cast with his comrades from the behavior

544
00:43:50.14 --> 00:43:53.26
and how closely he is observed on the battlefield.

545
00:43:53.26 --> 00:43:57.98
Again, talking about reputation once again.

546
00:43:57.98 --> 00:44:03.42
The officers too are commented upon and closely observed.

547
00:44:03.42 --> 00:44:05.70
Everyone's watching the officers.

548
00:44:05.70 --> 00:44:10.30
The men are very proud of those who are brave in the field and kind in consider it

549
00:44:10.30 --> 00:44:14.30
to the soldiers and under them.

550
00:44:14.30 --> 00:44:20.66
An act of kindness done by an officer has often during battle been the cause of his life

551
00:44:20.66 --> 00:44:22.26
being saved.

552
00:44:22.26 --> 00:44:25.02
Got a little relationship going.

553
00:44:25.02 --> 00:44:31.74
Nay, whatever folks may say upon the matter, I know from experience that in our army,

554
00:44:31.74 --> 00:44:38.26
the men like best be officer by gentleman, men whose education is rendered them more kind

555
00:44:38.26 --> 00:44:44.74
in manners than your course officer sprung from obscure origin and whose style is brutal

556
00:44:44.74 --> 00:44:46.78
and overbearing.

557
00:44:46.78 --> 00:44:52.66
So as I was reading through that, at first I kind of got a little bit taken a back

558
00:44:52.66 --> 00:44:56.94
and said, what are you trying to say if you have a men of college or that's what you need,

559
00:44:56.94 --> 00:44:59.42
you need to be from this good upbringing.

560
00:44:59.42 --> 00:45:02.42
But that might be what he's saying at that time.

561
00:45:02.42 --> 00:45:05.94
But the important part is it's how you treat people.

562
00:45:05.94 --> 00:45:08.06
Doesn't matter what background you came from.

563
00:45:08.06 --> 00:45:13.26
He says, men whose education is rendered them more kind in manners and rather than someone

564
00:45:13.26 --> 00:45:15.86
that's from an obscure origin.

565
00:45:15.86 --> 00:45:19.46
What I'm telling you is it doesn't matter where you're from and he would agree with this

566
00:45:19.46 --> 00:45:21.78
now if he was here to talk with me.

567
00:45:21.78 --> 00:45:22.78
Of course.

568
00:45:22.78 --> 00:45:24.38
But it's not.

569
00:45:24.38 --> 00:45:30.38
He's talking about the the men like to work for officers that aren't brutal and overbearing.

570
00:45:30.38 --> 00:45:32.02
No one likes that.

571
00:45:32.02 --> 00:45:35.14
And you don't perform well.

572
00:45:35.14 --> 00:45:38.90
You want to build the relationship with your troops, the kindness done by an officer

573
00:45:38.90 --> 00:45:42.46
is often during the battle, been the cause of his life being saved.

574
00:45:42.46 --> 00:45:49.10
That means guys are trying to win.

575
00:45:49.10 --> 00:45:55.42
Back to the book and let me bear testimony to the courage and endurance of that army

576
00:45:55.42 --> 00:46:02.14
under trials and hardships, such as few armies in any age I should think endured.

577
00:46:02.14 --> 00:46:07.34
I've seen officers and men hobbling forward with tears in their eyes from the misery

578
00:46:07.34 --> 00:46:13.42
of long miles, empty stomachs and ragged backs without even shoes or stockings on their

579
00:46:13.42 --> 00:46:15.66
bleeding feet.

580
00:46:15.66 --> 00:46:19.94
And it was not a little thing that would bring a tear into the eyes of a riflemen of the

581
00:46:19.94 --> 00:46:22.54
peninsula wars.

582
00:46:22.54 --> 00:46:29.10
Yuts, who had not long been removed from their parents home and care, officers and men

583
00:46:29.10 --> 00:46:36.70
have borne hardships and privations such as in our more peaceful days, we have little conception

584
00:46:36.70 --> 00:46:38.58
of.

585
00:46:38.58 --> 00:46:45.02
And yet these men, faint and weary with toil, would brighten up in a moment when the

586
00:46:45.02 --> 00:46:51.26
war granted amongst us that the enemy were at hand.

587
00:46:51.26 --> 00:47:02.38
Once again he's ragging on you have really been to war lately, peaceful days and brutal

588
00:47:02.38 --> 00:47:06.98
privations that these guys go through and yet they're still ready to step up.

589
00:47:06.98 --> 00:47:09.38
Back to the book it was just at the close of the battle.

590
00:47:09.38 --> 00:47:13.86
The dreadful turmoil and noise of the engagement had hardly subsided and I began to look

591
00:47:13.86 --> 00:47:19.70
at the faces of the men close around me to see who had escaped the dangers of the hour.

592
00:47:19.70 --> 00:47:22.62
I saw that the ranks of the riflemen looked very thin.

593
00:47:22.62 --> 00:47:27.86
It seemed to me that one half had gone down.

594
00:47:27.86 --> 00:47:33.22
We had four companies with a 95th and were commanded that day by major traverse.

595
00:47:33.22 --> 00:47:37.90
He was a man much liked by the men of the rifles and indeed deservedly beloved by all

596
00:47:37.90 --> 00:47:39.86
who knew him.

597
00:47:39.86 --> 00:47:46.86
He was a tight hand but a soldier likes that better than a slavinly officer.

598
00:47:46.86 --> 00:47:49.86
Pay attention to that one.

599
00:47:49.86 --> 00:47:53.70
Don't be a slavinly leader.

600
00:47:53.70 --> 00:47:55.94
The troops prefer the tight hand.

601
00:47:55.94 --> 00:47:59.66
Back to the book I had observed him more than once during this day spurring here and there

602
00:47:59.66 --> 00:48:03.62
keeping the men well up and apparently in the highest spirits.

603
00:48:03.62 --> 00:48:07.06
He could not have enjoyed himself more I am sure.

604
00:48:07.06 --> 00:48:11.70
If he had been at a horse race or following a good pack of hounds.

605
00:48:11.70 --> 00:48:12.98
The battle was just over.

606
00:48:12.98 --> 00:48:16.78
A flag of troops came over from the French.

607
00:48:16.78 --> 00:48:20.38
We threw ourselves down where we were standing when the fire ceased.

608
00:48:20.38 --> 00:48:22.26
A Frenchman lay close beside me.

609
00:48:22.26 --> 00:48:26.54
He was dying and called to me for water which I understood him to require more from his

610
00:48:26.54 --> 00:48:29.86
manner than his words.

611
00:48:29.86 --> 00:48:33.58
I need not say that I got up and gave it to him.

612
00:48:33.58 --> 00:48:38.42
Whilst I did so, down galloped the major in front, just in the same good spirits he'd

613
00:48:38.42 --> 00:48:44.30
been in all day, plugging along, avoiding with some little difficulty, the dead and dying

614
00:48:44.30 --> 00:48:47.02
which were strewn about.

615
00:48:47.02 --> 00:48:53.18
He was never a very good-looking man being hard-featured and thin, a hatchet faced man as we

616
00:48:53.18 --> 00:48:55.50
used to say.

617
00:48:55.50 --> 00:48:59.66
But he was a regular good and a real English soldier.

618
00:48:59.66 --> 00:49:06.66
And that's better than if he had been the handsomeest ladies man in the army.

619
00:49:06.66 --> 00:49:08.66
Legit.

620
00:49:08.66 --> 00:49:13.58
Totally legit.

621
00:49:13.58 --> 00:49:16.94
Back to the book, a French soldier was lying beside me at this time.

622
00:49:16.94 --> 00:49:21.74
He was badly wounded and hearing him moan as he lay after I had done looking at the cavalry.

623
00:49:21.74 --> 00:49:24.66
I turned my attention to him and getting up.

624
00:49:24.66 --> 00:49:27.46
Lifted his head and poured some water into his mouth.

625
00:49:27.46 --> 00:49:31.66
He was dying fast, but he thanked me in a foreign language, which although I did not exactly

626
00:49:31.66 --> 00:49:35.58
understand, I could easily make out by the lucky gave me.

627
00:49:35.58 --> 00:49:42.42
Mullins of the rifles, who stepped up whilst I supported his head, damned me for a fool

628
00:49:42.42 --> 00:49:43.90
for my pains.

629
00:49:43.90 --> 00:49:49.94
Better knock out his brains, Harris, he said, he's done us, mischief, enough.

630
00:49:49.94 --> 00:49:54.38
I'll be bound for it today.

631
00:49:54.38 --> 00:50:00.82
The rifleman Harris is still a pretty sympathetic dude.

632
00:50:00.82 --> 00:50:04.94
Back to the book, towards evening I posted upon a rising ground amongst a clump of tall

633
00:50:04.94 --> 00:50:06.26
trees.

634
00:50:06.26 --> 00:50:10.10
There seemed to have been a sharp skirmish here as three Frenchmen were lying dead amongst

635
00:50:10.10 --> 00:50:12.94
the long grass upon the spot where I was standing.

636
00:50:12.94 --> 00:50:17.66
As I threw my rifle to my shoulder and walked past them on my beat, I observed they had

637
00:50:17.66 --> 00:50:22.62
been plundered and their haversax having been torn off some of the contents were scattered

638
00:50:22.62 --> 00:50:25.62
about.

639
00:50:25.62 --> 00:50:31.74
War is a sad blunter of the feelings I have often thought since those days.

640
00:50:31.74 --> 00:50:38.10
The contemplation of three ghastly bodies in this lonely spot failed then in making the slightest

641
00:50:38.10 --> 00:50:40.50
impression upon me.

642
00:50:40.50 --> 00:50:49.22
The sight had become even in the short time I had been engaged in the trade, but two familiar.

643
00:50:49.22 --> 00:50:57.74
And now there another truce kind of happens and he's observing the scene in this church

644
00:50:57.74 --> 00:50:58.98
yard.

645
00:50:58.98 --> 00:51:01.34
The scene in this church yard was somewhat singular.

646
00:51:01.34 --> 00:51:05.90
Two long tables had been procured from some houses near and were placed end to end amongst

647
00:51:05.90 --> 00:51:12.02
the graves and upon them were laid the men whose limbs it was found necessary to amputate.

648
00:51:12.02 --> 00:51:17.46
Both French and English were constantly lifted on and off these tables.

649
00:51:17.46 --> 00:51:22.66
As soon as the operation was performed upon one lot they were carried off and in those

650
00:51:22.66 --> 00:51:25.78
waiting behind were hoisted up.

651
00:51:25.78 --> 00:51:30.86
The surgeons with their sleeves turned up and their hands and arms covered in blood looking

652
00:51:30.86 --> 00:51:34.70
like butchers in the shambles.

653
00:51:34.70 --> 00:51:40.18
I saw as I passed at least 20 legs lying on the ground, many of them being clothed in the

654
00:51:40.18 --> 00:51:44.70
long black gators then worn by the infantry line.

655
00:51:44.70 --> 00:51:49.26
The surgeons had plenty of work on hand that day and not having the time to take the

656
00:51:49.26 --> 00:51:50.94
clothes off the wounded.

657
00:51:50.94 --> 00:51:55.86
They merely ripped the seams and turned the cloth back, proceeding with the operation as fast

658
00:51:55.86 --> 00:51:58.82
as they could.

659
00:51:58.82 --> 00:52:03.82
Many of the wounded came straggling into this church yard and search of assistance by themselves.

660
00:52:03.82 --> 00:52:10.18
I saw one man faint with loss of blood staggering along and turned to a system.

661
00:52:10.18 --> 00:52:15.34
He was severely wounded in the head, his face being completely encrusted with blood which

662
00:52:15.34 --> 00:52:19.42
had flowing during the night now dried.

663
00:52:19.42 --> 00:52:24.90
One eyeball was knocked out of the socket and hung down upon his cheek.

664
00:52:24.90 --> 00:52:30.70
Another man I observed who had been brought in and propped up against a grave mound.

665
00:52:30.70 --> 00:52:32.74
He seemed very badly hurt.

666
00:52:32.74 --> 00:52:37.26
The men who had carried him into the church yard had placed his cap filled with the fragments

667
00:52:37.26 --> 00:52:42.50
of biscuit close beside his head and he lay and occasionally turned his mouth towards

668
00:52:42.50 --> 00:52:47.26
it, got a hold of a piece of biscuit and munched it.

669
00:52:47.26 --> 00:52:51.86
As I was about to leave the church yard, Dr. Ridgeway, one of the surgeons called me back

670
00:52:51.86 --> 00:52:57.70
to assist with holding a man he was endeavouring to operate upon.

671
00:52:57.70 --> 00:53:01.90
Come and help me with this man, he said, where I shall be all day cutting a ball out of his

672
00:53:01.90 --> 00:53:04.18
shoulder.

673
00:53:04.18 --> 00:53:07.30
The patient's name was Douder, an Irishman.

674
00:53:07.30 --> 00:53:12.18
He disliked the doctor's efforts and arrived and twisted so much during the operation

675
00:53:12.18 --> 00:53:16.66
that it was with difficulty Dr. Ridgeway could perform it.

676
00:53:16.66 --> 00:53:21.94
He found a necessary to cut very deep and Douder made a terrible outcry at every fresh

677
00:53:21.94 --> 00:53:22.94
incision.

678
00:53:22.94 --> 00:53:28.26
Oh, Dr. Deer, doctor, he said, it's murdering me you are.

679
00:53:28.26 --> 00:53:32.70
Blood and hounds, I shall die, I shall die for the love of the Lord, don't cut me all

680
00:53:32.70 --> 00:53:36.02
the pieces.

681
00:53:36.02 --> 00:53:39.10
Douder was not altogether wrong.

682
00:53:39.10 --> 00:53:46.38
For although he survived the operation, he died shortly thereafter from the effects of his wounds.

683
00:53:46.38 --> 00:53:57.22
Again, you just got surgeons mixing blood and not clean and not even cutting off clothes

684
00:53:57.22 --> 00:53:58.22
or sterilizing.

685
00:53:58.22 --> 00:54:02.50
I mean, the amount of people that must have lost from the infections after the fact

686
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:09.70
is just crazy.

687
00:54:09.70 --> 00:54:13.02
Now they weren't fighting all the time.

688
00:54:13.02 --> 00:54:17.90
And at this point, they are quartered into house and Spain and again, Spain was divided

689
00:54:17.90 --> 00:54:24.86
at the time and there was friendly and enemy, Spain and so they are quartered in a house

690
00:54:24.86 --> 00:54:26.94
and there's a family there.

691
00:54:26.94 --> 00:54:30.82
Here we go to the book, the mistress of the house, seeing that I was the head man, occasionally

692
00:54:30.82 --> 00:54:36.78
came down and sat beside me as I worked, bringing her daughter, a very handsome, dark-eyed

693
00:54:36.78 --> 00:54:42.22
Spanish girl and as a matter of course, I fell in love.

694
00:54:42.22 --> 00:54:47.18
We soon became better acquainted and the mother one evening having sat and chattered to

695
00:54:47.18 --> 00:54:52.26
me serving me with wine and other good things on my rising to leave the shop made a signal

696
00:54:52.26 --> 00:54:54.54
for me to follow her.

697
00:54:54.54 --> 00:54:58.98
She had managed to pick up a little English and I knew a few words of the Spanish language

698
00:54:58.98 --> 00:55:02.30
so that we could pretty well comprehend each other's meeting.

699
00:55:02.30 --> 00:55:07.26
And after leading me into their sitting room, she brought in her handsome daughter and without

700
00:55:07.26 --> 00:55:12.30
more circumstances offered her to me for a wife.

701
00:55:12.30 --> 00:55:16.74
The offer was attempting one, but the conditions of the marriage made it impossible for me

702
00:55:16.74 --> 00:55:21.58
to comply since I was to change my religion and dessert my colors.

703
00:55:21.58 --> 00:55:27.26
The old-dame proposed to conceal me, effectively, when the army marched after which I was

704
00:55:27.26 --> 00:55:33.26
to live like a gentleman with the handsome Maria for a life.

705
00:55:33.26 --> 00:55:39.02
It was hard to refuse so tempting and offer with pretty Maria endeavering to back her mother's

706
00:55:39.02 --> 00:55:41.02
proposal.

707
00:55:41.02 --> 00:55:46.14
I, however, made them understand that nothing would tempt me to dessert and promising

708
00:55:46.14 --> 00:55:51.34
to try and get my discharge when I returned to England, I protested I would then return

709
00:55:51.34 --> 00:55:54.78
and marry Maria.

710
00:55:54.78 --> 00:56:01.06
Soon after this the army marched for Spain, the rifles paraded in the very street where

711
00:56:01.06 --> 00:56:08.94
the shop I had so long worked at was situated and I saw Maria at the window.

712
00:56:08.94 --> 00:56:13.42
As our bugle struck up, she waved her handkerchief.

713
00:56:13.42 --> 00:56:20.26
I returned the salute and in half an hour had forgotten all about her.

714
00:56:20.26 --> 00:56:26.86
So much for the soldiers love that I read that and I said, I have to read this.

715
00:56:26.86 --> 00:56:33.34
This is to every 18, 19, 20 and 21 year old service member out there that you made the

716
00:56:33.34 --> 00:56:38.46
girlier dreams and you think you're going to do some dumb stuff.

717
00:56:38.46 --> 00:56:41.22
Don't do the dumb stuff.

718
00:56:41.22 --> 00:56:47.34
Go back to your platoon and in a half an hour you'll forget about her because that's what

719
00:56:47.34 --> 00:56:48.34
happens.

720
00:56:48.34 --> 00:56:55.02
Such so much for a soldier's love.

721
00:56:55.02 --> 00:56:58.86
Back to the book, every man in the rifle seemed only anxious to get a wrap at the French

722
00:56:58.86 --> 00:57:01.42
again.

723
00:57:01.42 --> 00:57:05.78
On a non-weed toiled, I love to remember the appearance of that army as we moved along

724
00:57:05.78 --> 00:57:06.78
at this time.

725
00:57:06.78 --> 00:57:10.10
It was a glorious sight to see our colors spread in these fields.

726
00:57:10.10 --> 00:57:11.86
The men seemed invincible.

727
00:57:11.86 --> 00:57:19.06
Nothing I thought could have beaten them.

728
00:57:19.06 --> 00:57:23.70
He's talking about a guy named Cardo.

729
00:57:23.70 --> 00:57:28.26
He was found to be a most gallant officer when we were engaged with the enemy in the field.

730
00:57:28.26 --> 00:57:33.74
He was killed whilst fighting bravely in the Pyrenees and amongst other Jewry he wore, he had

731
00:57:33.74 --> 00:57:37.86
a ring on his finger worth 150 guineas.

732
00:57:37.86 --> 00:57:43.18
He lay dead on the field one of our rifle, rifleman named Orr, observed the sparkling

733
00:57:43.18 --> 00:57:47.10
gem and immediately resolved to make a prize of it.

734
00:57:47.10 --> 00:57:51.42
The ring however was so firmly fixed that Orr could not draw it from the finger and whipping

735
00:57:51.42 --> 00:57:55.94
out his knife cut the finger off at the joint.

736
00:57:55.94 --> 00:58:01.14
After the battle or offered the ring for sale amongst the officers and on inquiry the

737
00:58:01.14 --> 00:58:05.46
manner in which he obtained it transpired.

738
00:58:05.46 --> 00:58:14.10
Orr was in consequence, tried by court martial and sent us to receive 500 lashes which

739
00:58:14.10 --> 00:58:16.70
sentenced his carried into execution.

740
00:58:16.70 --> 00:58:23.78
There's some significant corpal punishment going on here with the lashes and that's

741
00:58:23.78 --> 00:58:24.78
one of the cases.

742
00:58:24.78 --> 00:58:29.70
I mean, you know when you're executing someone for being drunk and disorderly, you're

743
00:58:29.70 --> 00:58:33.78
going to get some pretty severe punishment for cutting the finger off of one of your officers

744
00:58:33.78 --> 00:58:39.62
so you can steal their ring.

745
00:58:39.62 --> 00:58:43.14
Back to the book it was during the heat of the day we were rather hotly pressed by the

746
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:46.98
enemy after having advanced somewhat to near their force.

747
00:58:46.98 --> 00:58:51.50
Given take is all fair enough but we were getting more kicks than half-pence as the saying

748
00:58:51.50 --> 00:58:58.30
is and their balls stung us so sharply that the officers gave the word to fire and retire.

749
00:58:58.30 --> 00:59:04.10
Outless, many got a lead in messenger as they did so which saved them the unpleasant necessity

750
00:59:04.10 --> 00:59:08.94
of retracing their ground altogether.

751
00:59:08.94 --> 00:59:14.30
Jock Gillespie and myself wheeled about and obeyed the order.

752
00:59:14.30 --> 00:59:19.82
Just as we had done so I saw Gillespie limp along as though someone had bestowed a violent

753
00:59:19.82 --> 00:59:22.22
kick upon his person.

754
00:59:22.22 --> 00:59:27.42
However he didn't give up at first but continued to load and fire and make off with other

755
00:59:27.42 --> 00:59:32.94
scourmetures to we halted and made another stand.

756
00:59:32.94 --> 00:59:38.46
For we never went further from them when once engaged then we could possibly help.

757
00:59:38.46 --> 00:59:42.70
I'm going to read that again.

758
00:59:42.70 --> 00:59:48.10
We continued to load and fire and make off with other scourmetures to we halted and made

759
00:59:48.10 --> 00:59:54.94
another stand for we never went further from them when once engaged then we could possibly

760
00:59:54.94 --> 00:59:59.90
help and what that means is covered move.

761
00:59:59.90 --> 01:00:05.46
So if you are out on the battlefield and you get too far away from the other element where

762
01:00:05.46 --> 01:00:09.62
you can no longer support them you've made a big mistake.

763
01:00:09.62 --> 01:00:17.18
So that's why they have doctrinal terms that mean I am in supporting distance.

764
01:00:17.18 --> 01:00:21.94
I won't go further away from you than where I can't help you.

765
01:00:21.94 --> 01:00:32.54
All right now speaking of lashing is there's another situation here.

766
01:00:32.54 --> 01:00:39.58
There was sort of a ceremony where they were gathering and standing in the parade sort

767
01:00:39.58 --> 01:00:47.98
of in a town square and somebody basically threw I think like a brick.

768
01:00:47.98 --> 01:00:51.50
One of the soldiers from one of the windows that was watching the other regiment.

769
01:00:51.50 --> 01:00:54.86
So there's one regiment standing on the parade field, handing out a wars or something.

770
01:00:54.86 --> 01:01:01.58
The other regiment sitting up in the various rooms around looking down and at some point

771
01:01:01.58 --> 01:01:08.54
this someone hooks a brick down and it hits the kernel.

772
01:01:08.54 --> 01:01:15.34
So this guy, Listen, was the guy that they grab and they think it's this guy, Listen,

773
01:01:15.34 --> 01:01:16.34
back to the book.

774
01:01:16.34 --> 01:01:21.70
Listen was sentenced to receive 800 lashes. The whole brigade turned out on the occasion and

775
01:01:21.70 --> 01:01:28.22
I remember that the drummers of the night regiment were the inflictors of the lash.

776
01:01:28.22 --> 01:01:35.86
Listened, Listen received the whole sentence without a murmur.

777
01:01:35.86 --> 01:01:39.10
This is a him talking about.

778
01:01:39.10 --> 01:01:44.74
As he goes on to talk about how this strict discipline about it and how it kind of fits

779
01:01:44.74 --> 01:01:48.38
in with the English mentality back to the book.

780
01:01:48.38 --> 01:01:54.02
They are strange set the English and so determined and unconscribable that they will have

781
01:01:54.02 --> 01:01:55.66
their way if they can.

782
01:01:55.66 --> 01:01:57.14
Think about that.

783
01:01:57.14 --> 01:02:03.26
Your soldiers, it's a great quality to have right your determined and unconscribable.

784
01:02:03.26 --> 01:02:04.26
But what does that mean?

785
01:02:04.26 --> 01:02:05.98
I mean you're going to have your way if you can.

786
01:02:05.98 --> 01:02:08.86
If you let them, they're going to get after it.

787
01:02:08.86 --> 01:02:11.10
Maybe in a good way you don't expect.

788
01:02:11.10 --> 01:02:16.94
Indeed, back to the book it indeed, it requires one who has authority in his face as

789
01:02:16.94 --> 01:02:21.30
well as at his back to make them respect and obey him.

790
01:02:21.30 --> 01:02:26.62
They see too often in the instance of sergeant majors that command does not suit ignorant

791
01:02:26.62 --> 01:02:29.18
and course-minded men.

792
01:02:29.18 --> 01:02:35.18
And that tyranny is too much used even in the brief authority which they have.

793
01:02:35.18 --> 01:02:37.98
So again, he's going back to the fact that even though you have to have, he's talking

794
01:02:37.98 --> 01:02:41.38
about the dichotomy of leadership, even though you have to have discipline, you can't have

795
01:02:41.38 --> 01:02:43.90
tyranny.

796
01:02:43.90 --> 01:02:49.50
Back to the book, a soldier I'm convinced is driven often to in subordination by being worried

797
01:02:49.50 --> 01:02:57.06
by these little-minded men for the various trifles about which the gentleman never thinks

798
01:02:57.06 --> 01:02:58.30
of tormenting him.

799
01:02:58.30 --> 01:03:06.62
So the little-minded person that harps on these little trifling things, that's what actually

800
01:03:06.62 --> 01:03:11.90
creates in subordination, whereas the gentleman never thinks of tormenting him with these

801
01:03:11.90 --> 01:03:14.18
little things.

802
01:03:14.18 --> 01:03:17.66
Like these little things don't matter.

803
01:03:17.66 --> 01:03:21.90
Then he goes on to balance this dichotomy of leadership back to the book, the moment

804
01:03:21.90 --> 01:03:28.38
the severity of the discipline of our army is relaxed in my opinion, farewell to its efficiency.

805
01:03:28.38 --> 01:03:35.14
But for men to be tormented about trifles, as I've seen at many times, is often very

806
01:03:35.14 --> 01:03:37.30
injurious to the whole core.

807
01:03:37.30 --> 01:03:42.10
So this is the perfect talking about the balance of the dichotomy of leadership.

808
01:03:42.10 --> 01:03:47.30
If you're too altruist, your guys are going to rebel against you, and if you're not strict

809
01:03:47.30 --> 01:03:51.06
enough, or you don't impose enough discipline, they're going to not have any control.

810
01:03:51.06 --> 01:04:01.26
So you've got to balance these two.

811
01:04:01.26 --> 01:04:05.38
Going forward back to the book, war is a sad blunter of the feelings of men.

812
01:04:05.38 --> 01:04:07.50
He said that before, and he's saying it again.

813
01:04:07.50 --> 01:04:11.98
We felt eager to be added again.

814
01:04:11.98 --> 01:04:17.46
Nay, I am afraid we longed for blood as the cheer of our comrades sounded in our ears,

815
01:04:17.46 --> 01:04:22.40
and yet amidst all this, softer feelings occasionally filled the breasts of those gallant

816
01:04:22.40 --> 01:04:27.10
fellows, even whilst they were thirsting for the sight of the enemy.

817
01:04:27.10 --> 01:04:32.42
Some of the men near me suddenly recollected as they saw the snow lying thickly on our

818
01:04:32.42 --> 01:04:36.14
past path that this was Christmas Eve.

819
01:04:36.14 --> 01:04:41.02
The recollection soon spread amongst the men, and many talk to home and scenes upon

820
01:04:41.02 --> 01:04:45.22
that night in the other days of the old England shedding tears as they spoke of the

821
01:04:45.22 --> 01:04:50.42
relative's and friends never to be seen again by them.

822
01:04:50.42 --> 01:04:53.86
As night approached, we became less talkative.

823
01:04:53.86 --> 01:04:59.70
The increasing weiriness of our limbs kept our tongues quieter, and we were many of us half

824
01:04:59.70 --> 01:05:05.22
a sleep as we walked when suddenly a shout arose in the front that the French were upon

825
01:05:05.22 --> 01:05:07.66
us.

826
01:05:07.66 --> 01:05:09.94
So guys are missing home.

827
01:05:09.94 --> 01:05:11.46
It's Christmas Eve.

828
01:05:11.46 --> 01:05:17.66
Nice little dusting of snow on the ground.

829
01:05:17.66 --> 01:05:22.10
They have this skirmish with the French there, and now they're continuing the first

830
01:05:22.10 --> 01:05:23.10
march.

831
01:05:23.10 --> 01:05:27.10
If you remember the march that we talked about with Napoleon's troops going into Russia

832
01:05:27.10 --> 01:05:32.66
and back, these guys are under the same basic conditions of if you want to move the

833
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:36.26
army, the army is going to walk.

834
01:05:36.26 --> 01:05:37.78
Back to the book, a sergeant of the night.

835
01:05:37.78 --> 01:05:42.82
So he's now on this also, not only they forced marching right now, they're starting to

836
01:05:42.82 --> 01:05:43.82
retreat.

837
01:05:43.82 --> 01:05:48.82
They're starting to take heavies, and they start a retreat.

838
01:05:48.82 --> 01:05:53.38
Back to the book, a sergeant of the 90 second highlanders just about this time fell dead with

839
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:58.98
fatigue, and no one stopped as we passed off for a many assistance.

840
01:05:58.98 --> 01:06:00.50
Night came down upon us.

841
01:06:00.50 --> 01:06:01.78
So let's think about that.

842
01:06:01.78 --> 01:06:05.58
And this, I highlighted that one, but throughout this book he talks about people that

843
01:06:05.58 --> 01:06:07.62
is dying, and he says they died of fatigue.

844
01:06:07.62 --> 01:06:10.54
I even know what that means actually.

845
01:06:10.54 --> 01:06:11.54
Maybe they're dehydrated.

846
01:06:11.54 --> 01:06:12.86
I don't know.

847
01:06:12.86 --> 01:06:17.06
But if you think about these guys who are risking their lives for each other, how exhausted

848
01:06:17.06 --> 01:06:20.50
are they that when someone falls out during this first march, the forced march, they just

849
01:06:20.50 --> 01:06:24.74
leave them there.

850
01:06:24.74 --> 01:06:30.50
Back to the book, night came down upon us without our having tasted food or halted.

851
01:06:30.50 --> 01:06:35.50
I speak for myself and those around me, all and all night long we continued this dreadful

852
01:06:35.50 --> 01:06:36.50
march.

853
01:06:36.50 --> 01:06:39.90
Men began to look into each other's faces and ask the questions.

854
01:06:39.90 --> 01:06:42.94
Ask the question, are we ever to be halted again?

855
01:06:42.94 --> 01:06:48.22
Many of the weaker sort were now seen to stagger, make a few desperate efforts, and then

856
01:06:48.22 --> 01:06:52.54
fall, perhaps, to rise no more.

857
01:06:52.54 --> 01:06:57.90
Most of us had devoured all we cared in our haversax, and each and in, and endeavored

858
01:06:57.90 --> 01:07:03.38
to catch up anything we could snatch from a hut or cottage in our route.

859
01:07:03.38 --> 01:07:08.38
Many, even at this period, would have struggled from the ranks and perished, had not

860
01:07:08.38 --> 01:07:12.98
crowdfered, held them together with a firm rain.

861
01:07:12.98 --> 01:07:18.38
One such bold and stern commander in the east, during a memorable disaster, and that

862
01:07:18.38 --> 01:07:22.14
devoted army had reached its refuge unbroken.

863
01:07:22.14 --> 01:07:28.10
Thus we staggered on night and day for about four days before we discovered the reason

864
01:07:28.10 --> 01:07:31.74
of this forced march.

865
01:07:31.74 --> 01:07:36.22
And they find out that they're marching actually towards England, they're trying to get

866
01:07:36.22 --> 01:07:43.82
away, and this guy that I talked about Crawford, he's pretty significant.

867
01:07:43.82 --> 01:07:46.14
And here's a little talk about Crawford.

868
01:07:46.14 --> 01:07:51.10
Crawford seemed to sniff the sound of battle from afar with peculiar feelings.

869
01:07:51.10 --> 01:07:55.54
He halted us for a few minutes occasionally when the distant clamor became more distinct,

870
01:07:55.54 --> 01:08:01.54
and his face turned toward the sound and seemed to light up and become less stern.

871
01:08:01.54 --> 01:08:06.46
He was then indeed that every poor fellow clutched his weapon more firmly and wished for

872
01:08:06.46 --> 01:08:09.22
a sight of the enemy.

873
01:08:09.22 --> 01:08:11.22
Before long they had their wish.

874
01:08:11.22 --> 01:08:16.54
The enemy's cavalry were on our skirts that night, and as we rushed out of a small village,

875
01:08:16.54 --> 01:08:20.90
we turned to bay.

876
01:08:20.90 --> 01:08:24.90
So even though they were treating, they're still having to fight.

877
01:08:24.90 --> 01:08:31.06
And this again, this guy Crawford is definitely a powerful leader back to the book.

878
01:08:31.06 --> 01:08:35.46
I remember one evening during the retreat, he detected two men straying away from the main

879
01:08:35.46 --> 01:08:36.46
body.

880
01:08:36.46 --> 01:08:43.12
It was in the early stage of that disastrous flight and Crawford knew, and Crawford knew

881
01:08:43.12 --> 01:08:47.38
well that he must do his utmost to keep the division together.

882
01:08:47.38 --> 01:08:52.14
He halted the brigade with a voice of thunder, ordered a drum-head court martial on

883
01:08:52.14 --> 01:08:56.18
the instant, and they were sentenced to a hundred apiece.

884
01:08:56.18 --> 01:09:01.58
Allstahasty trial was taking place, Crawford dismounting from his horse stood in the

885
01:09:01.58 --> 01:09:06.90
midst, looking stern and angry as a worried bulldog.

886
01:09:06.90 --> 01:09:13.14
He did not like retreating at all that man.

887
01:09:13.14 --> 01:09:18.22
They march a little bit further, and then back to the book, ordering a square to be formed.

888
01:09:18.22 --> 01:09:22.98
He spoke to the brigade as well as I can remember in these words, after having ordered

889
01:09:22.98 --> 01:09:29.10
the three before named men of the 95th to be brought to the square.

890
01:09:29.10 --> 01:09:35.74
Although he said, I should obtain the goodwill neither of the officers nor the men of

891
01:09:35.74 --> 01:09:40.62
the brigade here by doing so, I am resolved to punish these three men according to the

892
01:09:40.62 --> 01:09:45.66
sentence awarded, even though the French are at our heels.

893
01:09:45.66 --> 01:09:48.54
Begin with Daniel Hauens.

894
01:09:48.54 --> 01:09:53.66
So these guys were looked like they were going to desert and they got caught and he had

895
01:09:53.66 --> 01:09:57.62
a court martial on the spot and he was going to give them a hundred lashes or whatever

896
01:09:57.62 --> 01:09:59.46
the number was.

897
01:09:59.46 --> 01:10:05.46
And even though they were running and retreating, he's, alright, we're going to administer

898
01:10:05.46 --> 01:10:10.62
this punishment now, even though it's not popular, I got to do it.

899
01:10:10.62 --> 01:10:14.78
Back to the book, this was indeed no time to be lax and discipline in the general knew it.

900
01:10:14.78 --> 01:10:21.78
The men, as I said, were some of them, becoming careless and roughly in their demeanor,

901
01:10:21.78 --> 01:10:27.22
whilst others again I saw with the tears falling down their cheeks from the agony of their

902
01:10:27.22 --> 01:10:32.26
bleeding feet and many were ill with dysentery and from the effects of bad food they had

903
01:10:32.26 --> 01:10:34.74
got a hold of and devoured on the road.

904
01:10:34.74 --> 01:10:39.26
Our Napsacks, too, were a bitter enemy in this prolonged march.

905
01:10:39.26 --> 01:10:43.78
Many a man died, I am convinced, who would have borne up well to the end of the retreat,

906
01:10:43.78 --> 01:10:47.94
but for the infernal load we carried on our backs.

907
01:10:47.94 --> 01:10:51.10
My own Napsack was my bitterest enemy.

908
01:10:51.10 --> 01:10:56.34
I felt it pressed me to the earth almost at times and more than once felt as if I should

909
01:10:56.34 --> 01:10:59.42
die under its deadly embrace.

910
01:10:59.42 --> 01:11:03.54
The Napsacks, in my opinion, should have been abandoned at the very commencement of the

911
01:11:03.54 --> 01:11:08.62
retrograde movement, as it would have been better to have lost them all together, if,

912
01:11:08.62 --> 01:11:14.38
by such loss, we could have saved the poor fellows who, as it was, died strapped to them

913
01:11:14.38 --> 01:11:18.18
on the road.

914
01:11:18.18 --> 01:11:22.74
There was some difficulty in finding a place to tie howling's up, as the light brigade

915
01:11:22.74 --> 01:11:25.70
carried no halberts.

916
01:11:25.70 --> 01:11:30.14
However, they led him to a slender astree which grew near at hand.

917
01:11:30.14 --> 01:11:34.90
Don't trouble yourselves about tying me up, said howling's folding his arms, I'll take

918
01:11:34.90 --> 01:11:38.30
my punishment like a man.

919
01:11:38.30 --> 01:11:42.94
He did so without a murmur receiving the whole 300.

920
01:11:42.94 --> 01:11:49.34
His wife, who was present with us, I remember was a strong, hearty Irish woman.

921
01:11:49.34 --> 01:11:54.10
So, I don't worry about tying me up, you hit me 300 times.

922
01:11:54.10 --> 01:11:59.78
We had a, you know they do the whipping thing with the, when you get your belt.

923
01:11:59.78 --> 01:12:07.18
Do you remember Irish John, you tall, pretty lanky and real good at your jitsu, and he

924
01:12:07.18 --> 01:12:09.38
got his blue belt.

925
01:12:09.38 --> 01:12:16.98
And he walked through the whipping hallway to get his belt, the gauntlet, he walked through

926
01:12:16.98 --> 01:12:22.90
the gauntlet, he just walked and stopped at each person and gave them the opportunity

927
01:12:22.90 --> 01:12:25.02
to give them all they got.

928
01:12:25.02 --> 01:12:27.70
That was pretty legit.

929
01:12:27.70 --> 01:12:36.22
He sounds like he sounds like my, he sounds like my boy, howling's right here.

930
01:12:36.22 --> 01:12:39.66
More about Crawford right here, this is classic.

931
01:12:39.66 --> 01:12:43.54
They're, they're getting to a river, they got across a river on their retreat.

932
01:12:43.54 --> 01:12:47.82
Back to the book, presently he spied an officer who to save himself from being wet through.

933
01:12:47.82 --> 01:12:52.34
I suppose, and wearing a damp pair of breeches for the remainder of the day, had mounted

934
01:12:52.34 --> 01:12:57.18
on the back of one of his men.

935
01:12:57.18 --> 01:13:02.50
The sight of such a piece of a feminacy was enough to raise the collar of the general,

936
01:13:02.50 --> 01:13:07.66
and in a very short time he was plunging and splashing through the water after them both,

937
01:13:07.66 --> 01:13:09.82
put him down, sir, put him down.

938
01:13:09.82 --> 01:13:14.18
I desire you to put that officer down instantly, and the soldier in an instant, I dare

939
01:13:14.18 --> 01:13:19.42
say, while dropping his burden like a hot potato into the stream continued his progress

940
01:13:19.42 --> 01:13:20.42
through.

941
01:13:20.42 --> 01:13:23.78
Return back, sir, said Crawford to the officer.

942
01:13:23.78 --> 01:13:25.50
And go through the water like the others.

943
01:13:25.50 --> 01:13:30.54
I will not allow my officers to ride upon the men's back through the rivers.

944
01:13:30.54 --> 01:13:33.66
They'll must take their share of light here.

945
01:13:33.66 --> 01:13:37.74
You can just go ahead and note that down as how to lead.

946
01:13:37.74 --> 01:13:43.02
That's just, that's a metaphorical and literal example.

947
01:13:43.02 --> 01:13:49.58
Hey, I'm going to ride on the back of my enlisted man so that I can stay dry.

948
01:13:49.58 --> 01:13:50.82
What a savage.

949
01:13:50.82 --> 01:13:53.66
I think that, that guy should have gotten some lashes.

950
01:13:53.66 --> 01:13:58.18
Back to the book, General Crawford was indeed one of the few men who was apparently

951
01:13:58.18 --> 01:14:03.42
created for the command during such dreadful scenes as we were familiar with in this retreat.

952
01:14:03.42 --> 01:14:09.10
He seemed an iron man, nothing dented him, nothing turned him from his purpose.

953
01:14:09.10 --> 01:14:12.34
War was his very element.

954
01:14:12.34 --> 01:14:21.90
And toil and danger seemed to call forth and increasing determination to surmount them.

955
01:14:21.90 --> 01:14:31.10
I'll let you get it. Now they are continuing to march and again, it's a story we've

956
01:14:31.10 --> 01:14:36.42
heard many times on here and how harsh foot marches can be.

957
01:14:36.42 --> 01:14:42.62
And at this point, rifleman Harris, he doesn't think he's going to make it.

958
01:14:42.62 --> 01:14:44.90
And he's fading fast.

959
01:14:44.90 --> 01:14:46.46
He's marching with a guy named Brooks.

960
01:14:46.46 --> 01:14:50.78
They're kind of broken up into pairs to try and stay together a little bit.

961
01:14:50.78 --> 01:14:53.62
He's trying to maintain back to the book.

962
01:14:53.62 --> 01:14:57.14
I remember sir, Dudley Hill passing me on a muel this day.

963
01:14:57.14 --> 01:15:00.14
He wore a Spanish straw hat and had his cloak on.

964
01:15:00.14 --> 01:15:02.54
He looked back when he had passed and addressed me.

965
01:15:02.54 --> 01:15:07.30
Harris said he, I see you cannot keep up.

966
01:15:07.30 --> 01:15:10.58
He peered very sorry for me for he knew me well.

967
01:15:10.58 --> 01:15:15.06
You must do your best, he said, my man and keep up with us.

968
01:15:15.06 --> 01:15:18.38
Or you will fall into the hands of the enemy.

969
01:15:18.38 --> 01:15:24.46
As the day wore on, I grew weaker and weaker and at last, spite all of my efforts.

970
01:15:24.46 --> 01:15:29.38
I saw the main body leave me hopelessly in the lurch.

971
01:15:29.38 --> 01:15:31.38
Brooks himself was getting weaker too.

972
01:15:31.38 --> 01:15:37.14
He saw it was a little used to urge me on and at length, ascending to my repeated requests

973
01:15:37.14 --> 01:15:39.38
to be left behind.

974
01:15:39.38 --> 01:15:41.82
He hurried on as well.

975
01:15:41.82 --> 01:15:47.06
And he was able without a word of farewell.

976
01:15:47.06 --> 01:15:52.74
I now soon sank down in the road and lay beside another man who had also fallen was apparently

977
01:15:52.74 --> 01:16:06.78
dead and whom I'd recognized as one of our sergeants named Taylor.

978
01:16:06.78 --> 01:16:12.46
Whilst we lay exhausted in the road, the rear guard, which was now endeavouring to drive

979
01:16:12.46 --> 01:16:17.02
on the stragglers approached and a sergeant of the rifles came up and stopped and look at

980
01:16:17.02 --> 01:16:18.66
us.

981
01:16:18.66 --> 01:16:22.86
He addressed himself to me and ordered me to rise, but I told him it was useless for him

982
01:16:22.86 --> 01:16:29.10
to trouble himself about me as I was unable to move a step further.

983
01:16:29.10 --> 01:16:33.34
Whilst he was urging me to endeavor to rise up, the officer in command of the rear guard

984
01:16:33.34 --> 01:16:35.30
also stepped up.

985
01:16:35.30 --> 01:16:37.86
The name of this officer was Lieutenant Cox.

986
01:16:37.86 --> 01:16:41.98
He was a brave and good man and observing that the sergeant was rough in his language

987
01:16:41.98 --> 01:16:49.10
and manner towards me, he silenced him and bade the guard proceed and leave me.

988
01:16:49.10 --> 01:16:50.74
Bet him die quietly, Hicks.

989
01:16:50.74 --> 01:16:55.98
He said to the sergeant, I know him well, he's not a man to lie here if he could get on.

990
01:16:55.98 --> 01:16:58.62
I'm sorry, Harris.

991
01:16:58.62 --> 01:17:06.02
He said to see you reduced to this fright fear, there is no help to be had now.

992
01:17:06.02 --> 01:17:15.18
He then moved on after his men and left me to my fate.

993
01:17:15.18 --> 01:17:17.26
Lot different than never leave a man behind.

994
01:17:17.26 --> 01:17:19.26
You've actually got people disengue.

995
01:17:19.26 --> 01:17:20.74
You're not going to make it.

996
01:17:20.74 --> 01:17:21.98
I can see you're not going to make it.

997
01:17:21.98 --> 01:17:29.34
I know you're a tough guy and if you're not walking right now, there's nothing for you.

998
01:17:29.34 --> 01:17:34.30
Now he lays there for a while and he actually wants to rest for a while.

999
01:17:34.30 --> 01:17:40.70
He regains a little bit of strength, he eventually crawls to a house, gets in the house

1000
01:17:40.70 --> 01:17:45.62
and gets a little bit of food, gets a little bit of, I would love to say water, but

1001
01:17:45.62 --> 01:17:48.98
he's not going to get his food and wine.

1002
01:17:48.98 --> 01:17:54.26
He recovers somewhat, he pretty much recovers.

1003
01:17:54.26 --> 01:17:59.90
Sleeps for a while wakes up, recovers and now he can walk again.

1004
01:17:59.90 --> 01:18:04.46
What do you think would happen now?

1005
01:18:04.46 --> 01:18:09.98
In a case as similar to this as possible, you know, but just now where I can't make it,

1006
01:18:09.98 --> 01:18:11.22
what do you do, carry him?

1007
01:18:11.22 --> 01:18:13.26
Yeah, you'd try and carry him, of course.

1008
01:18:13.26 --> 01:18:14.26
Other guys, guys.

1009
01:18:14.26 --> 01:18:23.94
Yeah, and it's horrible to think of these situations where if we have to move these men

1010
01:18:23.94 --> 01:18:26.90
and to sit there, let's away this.

1011
01:18:26.90 --> 01:18:31.66
You have to weigh this, if we try and carry it all over a wounded out, none of us are going

1012
01:18:31.66 --> 01:18:32.66
to live.

1013
01:18:32.66 --> 01:18:37.42
That's what that's the situation that they're likely facing.

1014
01:18:37.42 --> 01:18:42.02
Hey, you're either going to get out of here yourself and people don't understand how hard

1015
01:18:42.02 --> 01:18:43.54
it is to carry it down, man.

1016
01:18:43.54 --> 01:18:46.90
It's very, very difficult to carry it down, man.

1017
01:18:46.90 --> 01:18:50.90
Especially across terrain, you know, sometimes in wrestling practice, you pick up and

1018
01:18:50.90 --> 01:18:53.66
you pick up your partner and you do a couple of laps, right?

1019
01:18:53.66 --> 01:18:57.10
Yeah, you know, that's all good, you're on a nice smooth surface.

1020
01:18:57.10 --> 01:19:02.30
Because cooperating is not just dead weight, yeah, when you start carrying bodies around,

1021
01:19:02.30 --> 01:19:04.78
it's really, really difficult.

1022
01:19:04.78 --> 01:19:07.26
So you don't, it's not a one to one either.

1023
01:19:07.26 --> 01:19:11.90
So if one guy is down, it's not just one person carries that guy.

1024
01:19:11.90 --> 01:19:14.46
It actually has to be two or sometimes three.

1025
01:19:14.46 --> 01:19:19.58
When you have gear on, and we have methods of carrying guys, I mean, I can carry you

1026
01:19:19.58 --> 01:19:28.30
a little while, right? But after a little while, you know, be that 500 meters, 1000 meters,

1027
01:19:28.30 --> 01:19:30.62
you're not going to be here for, and also you're combat in effect.

1028
01:19:30.62 --> 01:19:36.50
If you can't, you can't utilize your weapon properly, not for, not for any length of time.

1029
01:19:36.50 --> 01:19:40.42
So, you know, in a situation like this, that the decision that these leaders are making

1030
01:19:40.42 --> 01:19:42.14
is, hey, guess what?

1031
01:19:42.14 --> 01:19:45.02
If we don't just keep walking, we're going to get overrun.

1032
01:19:45.02 --> 01:19:47.10
The French are going to catch us and we're all going to die.

1033
01:19:47.10 --> 01:19:49.50
So Harris, you got nothing for you.

1034
01:19:49.50 --> 01:19:54.30
So in content like now, we'll say that if there was a circumstance like that, where we're

1035
01:19:54.30 --> 01:20:03.42
going to lose more guys if we bring this guy with us or one big luxury that we have now

1036
01:20:03.42 --> 01:20:05.42
is we have air support.

1037
01:20:05.42 --> 01:20:08.46
So the enemy wants to keep coming out of us, cool.

1038
01:20:08.46 --> 01:20:10.78
We'll sit here and call drop bombs on them all day.

1039
01:20:10.78 --> 01:20:14.06
The situations like that have happened over and over again in the modern wars.

1040
01:20:14.06 --> 01:20:19.18
And in Iraq and Afghanistan, where small elements are out there in the field, they're about

1041
01:20:19.18 --> 01:20:24.70
to get overrun and the aircraft and air, air power comes in and completely saves the

1042
01:20:24.70 --> 01:20:29.06
day and keeps the enemy at bay for extended periods of time.

1043
01:20:29.06 --> 01:20:32.90
So we have an option, another option.

1044
01:20:32.90 --> 01:20:36.10
But in the, I guess, the ultimately be hypothetical then.

1045
01:20:36.10 --> 01:20:37.10
The case.

1046
01:20:37.10 --> 01:20:39.94
So hypothetically, then you got to put someone in that situation and see what they're

1047
01:20:39.94 --> 01:20:40.94
going to do.

1048
01:20:40.94 --> 01:20:44.02
And that's the decision you got to make as a leader on the spot.

1049
01:20:44.02 --> 01:20:45.02
Yeah.

1050
01:20:45.02 --> 01:20:46.02
Yeah.

1051
01:20:46.02 --> 01:20:51.66
I mean, you be weighing all these micro micro facets that are happening.

1052
01:20:51.66 --> 01:20:53.26
How far away are the bad guys?

1053
01:20:53.26 --> 01:20:54.26
Yeah.

1054
01:20:54.26 --> 01:20:55.26
Well, how many of them are there?

1055
01:20:55.26 --> 01:20:56.58
Do I reinforcements coming?

1056
01:20:56.58 --> 01:20:57.98
Is there any terrain I can take?

1057
01:20:57.98 --> 01:21:00.02
Is there what, you know, what can I do?

1058
01:21:00.02 --> 01:21:01.74
How many people are down?

1059
01:21:01.74 --> 01:21:02.74
Yeah.

1060
01:21:02.74 --> 01:21:04.66
You do have to weigh all these things out and make a decision.

1061
01:21:04.66 --> 01:21:06.06
It's going to be hard decision.

1062
01:21:06.06 --> 01:21:07.06
Yeah, for sure.

1063
01:21:07.06 --> 01:21:13.98
I mean, so you don't put like the the concept or should I say, like the action.

1064
01:21:13.98 --> 01:21:21.46
The action of at least trying to bring the guy with you ahead of like other guys lives.

1065
01:21:21.46 --> 01:21:27.98
So I'm a certain circumstance like this where you have to, you don't have any content.

1066
01:21:27.98 --> 01:21:28.98
You don't have any support.

1067
01:21:28.98 --> 01:21:30.46
You don't have any other options.

1068
01:21:30.46 --> 01:21:35.66
It's either other guys die or we leave this guy behind.

1069
01:21:35.66 --> 01:21:45.34
The fact that you tried to bring the guy doesn't Trump like the lives of other guys.

1070
01:21:45.34 --> 01:21:49.50
If the decision is to be made where it's understood like other guys would have died.

1071
01:21:49.50 --> 01:21:53.06
If we didn't leave this guy here, that would be okay.

1072
01:21:53.06 --> 01:21:57.46
It's not gonna be okay and you're gonna have to live with one horrible thought or the

1073
01:21:57.46 --> 01:21:58.46
other.

1074
01:21:58.46 --> 01:21:59.74
Right, right.

1075
01:21:59.74 --> 01:22:03.10
The thing that's powerful about we're not gonna leave everything anyone behind.

1076
01:22:03.10 --> 01:22:09.02
The thing that's powerful about that is if that's your default mode, your default mode is

1077
01:22:09.02 --> 01:22:12.26
to fight and that's what that's a we train.

1078
01:22:12.26 --> 01:22:16.14
That's when I say we I mean like America trains, we're not gonna leave you behind.

1079
01:22:16.14 --> 01:22:20.26
And so when that's your go to attitude, that's your go to attitude.

1080
01:22:20.26 --> 01:22:24.74
And all the thoughts about hey, we'll weigh it out and there's like no we're gonna fight,

1081
01:22:24.74 --> 01:22:28.78
we're gonna kill everyone and we're gonna do everything we can to bring everyone back

1082
01:22:28.78 --> 01:22:30.26
that's what we do.

1083
01:22:30.26 --> 01:22:32.46
And that is a powerful thing.

1084
01:22:32.46 --> 01:22:35.30
Yeah, man, these are savage times.

1085
01:22:35.30 --> 01:22:39.90
These are savage times, savage times.

1086
01:22:39.90 --> 01:22:44.94
Going, so like I said, he does recover though, luckily before the French get to him,

1087
01:22:44.94 --> 01:22:48.78
he recovers enough to get out start walking again.

1088
01:22:48.78 --> 01:22:55.58
And he talks a little bit how he was clinging, I mean he was clinging to survival.

1089
01:22:55.58 --> 01:23:00.54
Back to the book, it is however indeed astonishing how a man clings to life.

1090
01:23:00.54 --> 01:23:05.42
I am certain that had I laying down at this period, I should have found my last billet

1091
01:23:05.42 --> 01:23:08.42
on the spot I sank upon.

1092
01:23:08.42 --> 01:23:14.74
Suddenly I heard a shout in the front, which was prolonged in a sort of hub hub.

1093
01:23:14.74 --> 01:23:18.98
Even the stragglers who I saw dotting the road in front of me seem to have caught something

1094
01:23:18.98 --> 01:23:20.90
like hope.

1095
01:23:20.90 --> 01:23:25.94
And as the poor fellows now reach the top of the hill where a sending a hernicational exclamation

1096
01:23:25.94 --> 01:23:31.82
of joy, the first note of the sort I had heard for many days, when I reached the top

1097
01:23:31.82 --> 01:23:38.10
of the hill, the thing spoke for itself, their far away in our front, the English shipping

1098
01:23:38.10 --> 01:23:40.66
lay inside.

1099
01:23:40.66 --> 01:23:50.34
It's a view, had indeed acted like a restorative to our force and the men at the prospect

1100
01:23:50.34 --> 01:23:56.58
of the termination of such a march had plucked up spirit for a last effort.

1101
01:23:56.58 --> 01:24:02.26
Fellows who, like myself, seemed hardly have strengthened their legs to creep up the

1102
01:24:02.26 --> 01:24:09.38
assent seemed now to have picked up a fresh pair to get down with, such as hope to us poor

1103
01:24:09.38 --> 01:24:10.94
mortals.

1104
01:24:10.94 --> 01:24:19.54
So they obviously see the ships and that inspires them and they start moving a little

1105
01:24:19.54 --> 01:24:20.54
bit faster.

1106
01:24:20.54 --> 01:24:27.18
Back to the book, there was a recollect of the name of Bell of the rifles who had been

1107
01:24:27.18 --> 01:24:30.54
during this day holding a sort of creeping race with me.

1108
01:24:30.54 --> 01:24:33.78
We had passed and repost each other as our strength served.

1109
01:24:33.78 --> 01:24:37.62
Bell was a rather discontented fellow at the best of times.

1110
01:24:37.62 --> 01:24:42.74
But during this retreat, he had given full scope to his ill temper, cursing the hour he

1111
01:24:42.74 --> 01:24:47.70
was born and wishing his mother had strangled him when he came into the world in order

1112
01:24:47.70 --> 01:24:51.94
to have saved him from his present toil.

1113
01:24:51.94 --> 01:24:57.42
He had not now spoken for some time and the sight of the English shipping had apparently

1114
01:24:57.42 --> 01:25:01.26
a very beneficial effect upon him.

1115
01:25:01.26 --> 01:25:03.94
He burst into tears as he stood and looked at it.

1116
01:25:03.94 --> 01:25:09.34
Harris, he said, if it pleases God to let me reach those ships, I swear never to utter

1117
01:25:09.34 --> 01:25:16.50
a bad or discontented word again.

1118
01:25:16.50 --> 01:25:18.02
Appreciation.

1119
01:25:18.02 --> 01:25:26.10
And he did make to the ships and Harris, rifleman Harris made to the ships and they

1120
01:25:26.10 --> 01:25:35.26
got embarked on those ships and they sailed back to England for a few days and then

1121
01:25:35.26 --> 01:25:39.86
get off the English shore and then finally back to the book, one fine morning received

1122
01:25:39.86 --> 01:25:47.06
orders to disembark and our poor bare feet once more touched English ground.

1123
01:25:47.06 --> 01:25:51.66
The inhabitants flocked down to the beach to see us as we did so and they must have been

1124
01:25:51.66 --> 01:25:56.94
a good deal surprised at the spectacle we presented.

1125
01:25:56.94 --> 01:26:02.46
Our beards were long and ragged, almost all were without shoes and stockings.

1126
01:26:02.46 --> 01:26:07.46
Many had their clothes and accoutrements and fragments with their heads swath in old rags

1127
01:26:07.46 --> 01:26:13.66
and our weapons were covered with rust, whilst not a few had now from toil and fatigue

1128
01:26:13.66 --> 01:26:17.34
become quite blind.

1129
01:26:17.34 --> 01:26:24.34
Let not the reader however think that now we were to be despised as soldiers, long marches,

1130
01:26:24.34 --> 01:26:29.78
inclement weather and want to food had done their work upon us but we were perhaps better

1131
01:26:29.78 --> 01:26:33.50
than we appeared as the sequel showed.

1132
01:26:33.50 --> 01:26:39.66
Under the gallant Crawford we had made some tremendous marches and even galt our enemy

1133
01:26:39.66 --> 01:26:44.62
so severely making good our retreat.

1134
01:26:44.62 --> 01:26:50.06
But our comrades in adversity who had retired by the other road under general more turned

1135
01:26:50.06 --> 01:26:55.82
to bay there and showed the enemy that the English soldier is not to be beaten even under

1136
01:26:55.82 --> 01:27:00.98
the most adverse circumstances.

1137
01:27:00.98 --> 01:27:07.70
It fueled the death and slaughter, the march, the Bivouac and the retreat are no bad places

1138
01:27:07.70 --> 01:27:12.42
in which to judge men.

1139
01:27:12.42 --> 01:27:17.14
I have had some opportunities of judging them in all these situations and I should say

1140
01:27:17.14 --> 01:27:22.14
that the British are amongst the most splendid soldiers in the world.

1141
01:27:22.14 --> 01:27:26.66
Give them fair play and they are unconscribable.

1142
01:27:26.66 --> 01:27:33.02
For my own part I can only say that I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I

1143
01:27:33.02 --> 01:27:36.38
have ever done since.

1144
01:27:36.38 --> 01:27:44.18
And as I sit at work in my shop in Richmond Street, so ho, I look back upon that portion

1145
01:27:44.18 --> 01:27:53.10
of my time spent in the field of the peninsula as the only part where the overmembrants.

1146
01:27:53.10 --> 01:27:59.26
It is at such times that scenes long past come back upon my mind as if they had taken place

1147
01:27:59.26 --> 01:28:02.90
but yesterday.

1148
01:28:02.90 --> 01:28:13.18
I remember even the appearance of some regiments engaged in comrades long, molded to dust.

1149
01:28:13.18 --> 01:28:30.62
I see again performing the acts of heroes.

1150
01:28:30.62 --> 01:28:53.94
And I think it's safe to call Rifleman Benjamin Randall Harris a hero as well.

1151
01:28:53.94 --> 01:29:06.34
And at the same time I think it's important to remember that these heroes are not super

1152
01:29:06.34 --> 01:29:10.90
heroes like we see today in movies.

1153
01:29:10.90 --> 01:29:12.14
They don't wear a cape.

1154
01:29:12.14 --> 01:29:14.54
They don't have any superhuman strength.

1155
01:29:14.54 --> 01:29:27.66
They have no special powers what they do have is they have will to fight the will to drive

1156
01:29:27.66 --> 01:29:36.94
on the will to live the will to win.

1157
01:29:36.94 --> 01:29:43.50
And I think that's the superpower.

1158
01:29:43.50 --> 01:29:45.90
And it never ceases to amaze me.

1159
01:29:45.90 --> 01:29:48.78
These are normal people.

1160
01:29:48.78 --> 01:29:58.46
Rifleman Harris was a normal guy like us.

1161
01:29:58.46 --> 01:30:06.42
But when called upon to march, they march and when called upon to fight.

1162
01:30:06.42 --> 01:30:10.66
They fight and when called upon to rise up and overcome.

1163
01:30:10.66 --> 01:30:22.26
They do just that they rise up and overcome.

1164
01:30:22.26 --> 01:30:33.78
And that shows us that we can do the same thing in the challenges that we face.

1165
01:30:33.78 --> 01:30:39.26
We can do the same thing.

1166
01:30:39.26 --> 01:30:47.02
And overcome.

1167
01:30:47.02 --> 01:30:55.42
And I think that's all I've got for tonight's so echo.

1168
01:30:55.42 --> 01:31:02.58
Perhaps if you could let people know how they can support themselves and maybe if they

1169
01:31:02.58 --> 01:31:06.30
want to support this podcast as well.

1170
01:31:06.30 --> 01:31:08.30
It's crazy how these marches.

1171
01:31:08.30 --> 01:31:09.30
Right.

1172
01:31:09.30 --> 01:31:10.30
Brutal.

1173
01:31:10.30 --> 01:31:11.30
Yeah.

1174
01:31:11.30 --> 01:31:12.30
And this is I don't know.

1175
01:31:12.30 --> 01:31:15.30
Maybe from what I can remember the worst one.

1176
01:31:15.30 --> 01:31:18.86
Especially I'll be talking about with no shoes.

1177
01:31:18.86 --> 01:31:22.18
Their shoes probably just fall off with them first, you know, little bit.

1178
01:31:22.18 --> 01:31:26.06
And then they're walking with no shoes or barely any shoes or whatever.

1179
01:31:26.06 --> 01:31:27.90
Crying straight up just from the march.

1180
01:31:27.90 --> 01:31:32.14
By the way, not the, not the war or anything like that.

1181
01:31:32.14 --> 01:31:36.38
Where the marches yet.

1182
01:31:36.38 --> 01:31:38.50
This is big of an enemy.

1183
01:31:38.50 --> 01:31:40.50
He said his pack was his biggest enemy.

1184
01:31:40.50 --> 01:31:42.70
He had literally the death.

1185
01:31:42.70 --> 01:31:45.30
The kind where guys are still killing them.

1186
01:31:45.30 --> 01:31:48.26
Killings killing them.

1187
01:31:48.26 --> 01:31:52.78
So we just cut back from Utah obviously.

1188
01:31:52.78 --> 01:31:57.30
And you know, after every, we're doing that training where, you know, we brief debrief.

1189
01:31:57.30 --> 01:31:59.02
Go down exercise brief.

1190
01:31:59.02 --> 01:32:00.42
And then you know, we walk back and forth.

1191
01:32:00.42 --> 01:32:01.42
Right.

1192
01:32:01.42 --> 01:32:02.42
So, okay.

1193
01:32:02.42 --> 01:32:03.42
So, echo.

1194
01:32:03.42 --> 01:32:05.14
I'll just tell people have no idea what you're talking about.

1195
01:32:05.14 --> 01:32:06.42
So, I'll just find echo.

1196
01:32:06.42 --> 01:32:12.26
We just got echelon front, did a FTX field training exercise with the company.

1197
01:32:12.26 --> 01:32:13.42
We were in Utah.

1198
01:32:13.42 --> 01:32:17.46
We brought echo out so that he could get some footage and whatnot.

1199
01:32:17.46 --> 01:32:19.58
And so, so that's what we're talking about.

1200
01:32:19.58 --> 01:32:21.62
So we're in the field.

1201
01:32:21.62 --> 01:32:28.58
We're doing basically urban and combat with a group of, let's call them regular people,

1202
01:32:28.58 --> 01:32:35.10
business people that are learning leadership through experiential.

1203
01:32:35.10 --> 01:32:36.10
Environments.

1204
01:32:36.10 --> 01:32:37.10
Yeah.

1205
01:32:37.10 --> 01:32:38.10
It's an interesting one.

1206
01:32:38.10 --> 01:32:46.90
It's like a con, you know how, if you don't communicate with someone effectively,

1207
01:32:46.90 --> 01:32:47.90
it's falling apart.

1208
01:32:47.90 --> 01:32:48.90
Right.

1209
01:32:48.90 --> 01:32:51.18
Or if you don't, you know, it's like, and that's exactly what you're going to say.

1210
01:32:51.18 --> 01:32:53.10
And it's drawn out, stitching in life.

1211
01:32:53.10 --> 01:32:56.46
But this is like a condensed version of that.

1212
01:32:56.46 --> 01:32:57.46
Yes.

1213
01:32:57.46 --> 01:33:03.30
So, if you don't communicate with someone during an FTX, you know, within like 30 seconds

1214
01:33:03.30 --> 01:33:04.78
that something just went wrong.

1215
01:33:04.78 --> 01:33:08.70
And now we're getting shot in the face with airsoft rifles.

1216
01:33:08.70 --> 01:33:09.70
Yeah.

1217
01:33:09.70 --> 01:33:10.70
It's just fun.

1218
01:33:10.70 --> 01:33:12.70
It's really fun to watch from the outside.

1219
01:33:12.70 --> 01:33:13.70
Yeah.

1220
01:33:13.70 --> 01:33:14.70
Because you see it.

1221
01:33:14.70 --> 01:33:16.82
And I've been to another one too.

1222
01:33:16.82 --> 01:33:17.82
And yeah, you see it.

1223
01:33:17.82 --> 01:33:20.98
And it's interesting how in the beginning it's like, it's almost impossible.

1224
01:33:20.98 --> 01:33:21.98
Right.

1225
01:33:21.98 --> 01:33:25.66
And immediately communication breaks down immediately.

1226
01:33:25.66 --> 01:33:29.78
And then towards the end, you start to see people communicating, getting it.

1227
01:33:29.78 --> 01:33:32.54
You know, like, you kind of, a lot of times you got to over communicate.

1228
01:33:32.54 --> 01:33:33.54
Yeah, for sure.

1229
01:33:33.54 --> 01:33:36.62
But the more you do that, the more effective it is.

1230
01:33:36.62 --> 01:33:38.18
It's so crazy to watch.

1231
01:33:38.18 --> 01:33:39.18
It is.

1232
01:33:39.18 --> 01:33:41.22
And I don't know if you remember Dave saying this.

1233
01:33:41.22 --> 01:33:42.38
Dave told them.

1234
01:33:42.38 --> 01:33:46.74
He said, Jocco just told you the mistakes that you're going to make.

1235
01:33:46.74 --> 01:33:49.62
You told you what you're going to do.

1236
01:33:49.62 --> 01:33:51.26
And you're going to do it.

1237
01:33:51.26 --> 01:33:53.86
And then sure enough, and we're missing the one of them.

1238
01:33:53.86 --> 01:33:58.90
The funniest was the one individual that said they came up with a plan for something.

1239
01:33:58.90 --> 01:34:02.26
And we said, you know, you're risking to get a blue on blue on blue there.

1240
01:34:02.26 --> 01:34:06.90
And she said, she said, listen, I understand what you're saying.

1241
01:34:06.90 --> 01:34:10.02
But it's not like we're going to walk in there and start shooting each other.

1242
01:34:10.02 --> 01:34:11.02
Yeah.

1243
01:34:11.02 --> 01:34:12.02
That's not going to happen.

1244
01:34:12.02 --> 01:34:16.14
And and sure enough, that very girl was in a stressful situation.

1245
01:34:16.14 --> 01:34:19.06
And they ended a building from two different sides at the same time.

1246
01:34:19.06 --> 01:34:24.18
And sure enough, she, she dusted one of her, one of her teammates.

1247
01:34:24.18 --> 01:34:26.58
And it was, you know, it's one of those things.

1248
01:34:26.58 --> 01:34:27.58
Yeah.

1249
01:34:27.58 --> 01:34:28.94
I said, remember what you said yesterday?

1250
01:34:28.94 --> 01:34:29.94
She said, yeah.

1251
01:34:29.94 --> 01:34:30.94
Oh, yeah, I remember.

1252
01:34:30.94 --> 01:34:34.98
So just in, and I had the luxury of seeing it from the outside.

1253
01:34:34.98 --> 01:34:35.98
Oh, yeah.

1254
01:34:35.98 --> 01:34:36.98
So you can feel it though.

1255
01:34:36.98 --> 01:34:37.98
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:34:37.98 --> 01:34:41.98
But you're in a different situation position than me.

1257
01:34:41.98 --> 01:34:48.82
Anyway, the point is, so the terrain there was where the field and where you actually

1258
01:34:48.82 --> 01:34:52.82
do that that field training part of it is like, well, what would you say?

1259
01:34:52.82 --> 01:34:53.82
What?

1260
01:34:53.82 --> 01:34:56.98
Just do a hundred yards away from the where you do the brief and debrief.

1261
01:34:56.98 --> 01:34:58.26
It is about 400 yards.

1262
01:34:58.26 --> 01:34:59.26
Yeah.

1263
01:34:59.26 --> 01:35:00.26
So it's a little bit of a track.

1264
01:35:00.26 --> 01:35:01.26
300 yards.

1265
01:35:01.26 --> 01:35:03.26
If you're doing it again and again, multiple times.

1266
01:35:03.26 --> 01:35:12.34
So you're going brief exercise, debrief, brief exit, you know, so kind of all day, really.

1267
01:35:12.34 --> 01:35:17.54
So, and this was a situation where there was a hill and rocky, you know, hill.

1268
01:35:17.54 --> 01:35:19.98
So I'm walking right now, my camera the whole time.

1269
01:35:19.98 --> 01:35:24.94
And it's not slay to the my other camera, but, you know, it's something.

1270
01:35:24.94 --> 01:35:28.82
And so I'm walking back and forth all day, all day, where my feet are starting to get

1271
01:35:28.82 --> 01:35:29.82
like kind of tired.

1272
01:35:29.82 --> 01:35:36.14
And I'm thinking every single time though, every single time I'm thinking, this is nothing.

1273
01:35:36.14 --> 01:35:39.50
Compared to what you guys really do.

1274
01:35:39.50 --> 01:35:40.50
Yeah.

1275
01:35:40.50 --> 01:35:41.62
You know how nothing it was?

1276
01:35:41.62 --> 01:35:45.74
I didn't that thought didn't even go across my mind at all in any way, shape or something.

1277
01:35:45.74 --> 01:35:49.14
You know what I'm saying about that is while I'm walking, this was like, after lunch

1278
01:35:49.14 --> 01:35:50.14
time.

1279
01:35:50.14 --> 01:35:52.66
I'm thinking, and I'm seeing you guys and everyone's cruising and I'm thinking, is everyone

1280
01:35:52.66 --> 01:35:55.26
trying to act like this isn't like kind of kind of terrain?

1281
01:35:55.26 --> 01:35:58.10
I literally didn't think of it until you said this to me right now.

1282
01:35:58.10 --> 01:36:01.30
Yeah, the biggest, I was totally acting like, well, there's nothing.

1283
01:36:01.30 --> 01:36:02.30
No, I wasn't going to.

1284
01:36:02.30 --> 01:36:05.10
I was going to, I, yeah, brother, I had a lot of stuff.

1285
01:36:05.10 --> 01:36:06.10
Yeah, and it helps.

1286
01:36:06.10 --> 01:36:07.10
Yeah, it does.

1287
01:36:07.10 --> 01:36:12.90
But the fact is, do you do actually better when you pretend that it doesn't bother you?

1288
01:36:12.90 --> 01:36:13.90
Yes, that's right.

1289
01:36:13.90 --> 01:36:17.46
Yeah, we're going to remember that night in the night in the, so we started acting

1290
01:36:17.46 --> 01:36:20.02
all tired, accepting, showing everyone.

1291
01:36:20.02 --> 01:36:22.46
Yeah, it's true.

1292
01:36:22.46 --> 01:36:25.14
But nonetheless, the fact is, it wasn't nothing.

1293
01:36:25.14 --> 01:36:26.14
It wasn't nothing.

1294
01:36:26.14 --> 01:36:30.18
It felt it, and, you know, so I'm just funny.

1295
01:36:30.18 --> 01:36:34.62
I'm looking at you guys something like, hey, I wonder if these guys are, you know, but

1296
01:36:34.62 --> 01:36:35.62
no one said anything.

1297
01:36:35.62 --> 01:36:38.90
No, nobody said dang, these tracks are getting long.

1298
01:36:38.90 --> 01:36:40.70
That's because they were 300 meters, bro.

1299
01:36:40.70 --> 01:36:44.58
I feel like they're just saying.

1300
01:36:44.58 --> 01:36:51.22
But nonetheless, so every time I feel anything like that, I think of like, you guys first

1301
01:36:51.22 --> 01:36:56.10
and you guys are doing it in like crazy heat too, gear and like all this stuff.

1302
01:36:56.10 --> 01:36:58.54
And I think of this kind guys, these kind guys.

1303
01:36:58.54 --> 01:36:59.54
Yeah.

1304
01:36:59.54 --> 01:37:00.54
Right from inheritance.

1305
01:37:00.54 --> 01:37:01.54
The right from inheritance.

1306
01:37:01.54 --> 01:37:06.58
Feet all tore up, starving, starving.

1307
01:37:06.58 --> 01:37:07.58
Starving.

1308
01:37:07.58 --> 01:37:08.58
No sleep.

1309
01:37:08.58 --> 01:37:09.58
No water.

1310
01:37:09.58 --> 01:37:10.58
No water.

1311
01:37:10.58 --> 01:37:11.58
And people are trying to kill you.

1312
01:37:11.58 --> 01:37:12.58
Oh yeah, yeah.

1313
01:37:12.58 --> 01:37:13.58
So that's the point, man.

1314
01:37:13.58 --> 01:37:14.58
Yeah.

1315
01:37:14.58 --> 01:37:19.02
Because if these guys can rise and overcome that, then what, figure your personal potential.

1316
01:37:19.02 --> 01:37:20.02
Yeah.

1317
01:37:20.02 --> 01:37:21.02
Right?

1318
01:37:21.02 --> 01:37:22.02
Yeah.

1319
01:37:22.02 --> 01:37:23.02
Think of it.

1320
01:37:23.02 --> 01:37:24.02
Think of what more you could do.

1321
01:37:24.02 --> 01:37:25.02
Yeah.

1322
01:37:25.02 --> 01:37:27.02
I've got to look and bother some of your guys.

1323
01:37:27.02 --> 01:37:28.02
Yeah, that looked like that.

1324
01:37:28.02 --> 01:37:30.02
You're like, I made some dope videos though.

1325
01:37:30.02 --> 01:37:33.94
We're about to make a huge excuse right now too.

1326
01:37:33.94 --> 01:37:39.82
Which I don't even know if it's an excuse, but it's a factor where these like hard actual

1327
01:37:39.82 --> 01:37:45.46
hard times kind of call on you to exercise this kind of will.

1328
01:37:45.46 --> 01:37:49.22
And I think a lot of times we're not like hard times don't call on us.

1329
01:37:49.22 --> 01:37:50.22
Like this anyway.

1330
01:37:50.22 --> 01:37:51.78
I mean, hard times do, you know.

1331
01:37:51.78 --> 01:37:55.42
But you know what though?

1332
01:37:55.42 --> 01:38:01.74
You should, I mean, technically and potentially you should be able to exercise as much

1333
01:38:01.74 --> 01:38:03.38
will as it takes.

1334
01:38:03.38 --> 01:38:04.38
Really?

1335
01:38:04.38 --> 01:38:06.02
Now when you consider kind of the limits.

1336
01:38:06.02 --> 01:38:07.02
Right?

1337
01:38:07.02 --> 01:38:08.02
Because these are the limits.

1338
01:38:08.02 --> 01:38:09.02
These are the limits.

1339
01:38:09.02 --> 01:38:12.42
This is one of the stories where the guys like I'm done.

1340
01:38:12.42 --> 01:38:13.42
Yeah.

1341
01:38:13.42 --> 01:38:14.42
He's a little bit more.

1342
01:38:14.42 --> 01:38:15.42
I'm done.

1343
01:38:15.42 --> 01:38:16.62
Guys are saying, hey, if you stay here, you're going to die.

1344
01:38:16.62 --> 01:38:18.42
He's like, yeah, I cannot move anymore.

1345
01:38:18.42 --> 01:38:19.42
No.

1346
01:38:19.42 --> 01:38:24.90
You know, what point are you at when you cannot save your own life by walking?

1347
01:38:24.90 --> 01:38:25.90
You can't walk.

1348
01:38:25.90 --> 01:38:28.58
You can't take another step.

1349
01:38:28.58 --> 01:38:30.54
And he came back from that.

1350
01:38:30.54 --> 01:38:31.54
Yeah.

1351
01:38:31.54 --> 01:38:32.54
Jay.

1352
01:38:32.54 --> 01:38:33.54
Yeah.

1353
01:38:33.54 --> 01:38:36.54
And they told really good job in illustrating it.

1354
01:38:36.54 --> 01:38:41.78
Because you, or talking about it, where, because he mentioned the no shoes thing a few

1355
01:38:41.78 --> 01:38:42.78
times.

1356
01:38:42.78 --> 01:38:43.78
Yeah.

1357
01:38:43.78 --> 01:38:44.78
He did.

1358
01:38:44.78 --> 01:38:46.46
But again, I bet if, yeah.

1359
01:38:46.46 --> 01:38:47.46
Yeah.

1360
01:38:47.46 --> 01:38:50.22
He does a great job.

1361
01:38:50.22 --> 01:38:57.26
But you can't even begin to, yeah, you can't even begin to really get the point across.

1362
01:38:57.26 --> 01:38:58.26
Yeah.

1363
01:38:58.26 --> 01:38:59.26
The way it is.

1364
01:38:59.26 --> 01:39:03.18
As the leader, I was talking to a guy the other day.

1365
01:39:03.18 --> 01:39:06.14
That went to Buds and didn't make it through.

1366
01:39:06.14 --> 01:39:08.82
And I know them for a while.

1367
01:39:08.82 --> 01:39:13.34
And I just said, like, hey, man, you know, you're a good dude.

1368
01:39:13.34 --> 01:39:14.98
You know, what?

1369
01:39:14.98 --> 01:39:15.98
Why did you?

1370
01:39:15.98 --> 01:39:17.38
Why did you quit?

1371
01:39:17.38 --> 01:39:18.22
And he said, you know what?

1372
01:39:18.22 --> 01:39:19.90
It just sucked.

1373
01:39:19.90 --> 01:39:22.66
And I was like, okay, but didn't you know it was going to suck?

1374
01:39:22.66 --> 01:39:25.66
And he said, yeah, I knew it was going to suck.

1375
01:39:25.66 --> 01:39:30.78
But at the same time, you know, I watched on TV and I thought to myself, okay, yeah,

1376
01:39:30.78 --> 01:39:31.62
that's going to suck.

1377
01:39:31.62 --> 01:39:35.90
He said, so I thought I understood how it was going to suck.

1378
01:39:35.90 --> 01:39:37.34
But I didn't understand how it was going to suck.

1379
01:39:37.34 --> 01:39:38.34
And then I was there.

1380
01:39:38.34 --> 01:39:39.34
I said, this really sucks.

1381
01:39:39.34 --> 01:39:40.34
And he quit.

1382
01:39:40.34 --> 01:39:46.02
And again, a good dude that, that I'm kind of, you know, thinking myself, why?

1383
01:39:46.02 --> 01:39:49.14
I'm trying to figure out why people quit.

1384
01:39:49.14 --> 01:39:50.30
And that was what he said.

1385
01:39:50.30 --> 01:39:53.94
He said much like we're saying, because much of you could imagine.

1386
01:39:53.94 --> 01:39:55.58
And you think you're self-alman.

1387
01:39:55.58 --> 01:39:56.58
Yeah.

1388
01:39:56.58 --> 01:39:58.66
But I think I could make that one more step.

1389
01:39:58.66 --> 01:39:59.66
You don't know.

1390
01:39:59.66 --> 01:40:00.66
You're known to you.

1391
01:40:00.66 --> 01:40:01.66
You've been dehydrated.

1392
01:40:01.66 --> 01:40:07.06
Having people trying to shoot you, cleaning up your buddies brains off your jacket

1393
01:40:07.06 --> 01:40:09.38
for weeks, months on end.

1394
01:40:09.38 --> 01:40:10.38
Your dehydrated.

1395
01:40:10.38 --> 01:40:13.94
And now you have no shoes, no stockings.

1396
01:40:13.94 --> 01:40:20.06
And you're doing a forced march on this road for this, but they march four days without

1397
01:40:20.06 --> 01:40:21.38
stopping.

1398
01:40:21.38 --> 01:40:22.38
What even is that?

1399
01:40:22.38 --> 01:40:23.86
No, no, no, dang.

1400
01:40:23.86 --> 01:40:24.86
Yeah.

1401
01:40:24.86 --> 01:40:25.86
Yeah.

1402
01:40:25.86 --> 01:40:26.86
That's it.

1403
01:40:26.86 --> 01:40:30.26
I mean, you.

1404
01:40:30.26 --> 01:40:34.86
This kind of, that's not to mention like, no medical care.

1405
01:40:34.86 --> 01:40:35.86
No.

1406
01:40:35.86 --> 01:40:37.26
No one's coming to save you.

1407
01:40:37.26 --> 01:40:38.26
You know what?

1408
01:40:38.26 --> 01:40:39.26
You know what?

1409
01:40:39.26 --> 01:40:40.26
You know what?

1410
01:40:40.26 --> 01:40:44.38
If you have an ingrown toenail.

1411
01:40:44.38 --> 01:40:49.82
Right, right, like, like, a little thing that is Bob, it actually bothers you in actual life.

1412
01:40:49.82 --> 01:40:50.82
Yeah.

1413
01:40:50.82 --> 01:40:53.94
Think if you had that here, or you have a, or you have, let's say you got a spring

1414
01:40:53.94 --> 01:40:54.94
ankle.

1415
01:40:54.94 --> 01:40:56.82
A bad spring ankle.

1416
01:40:56.82 --> 01:40:58.78
I spray my ankle really bad before.

1417
01:40:58.78 --> 01:40:59.78
Sure.

1418
01:40:59.78 --> 01:41:01.30
You can't walk on it.

1419
01:41:01.30 --> 01:41:02.70
Well, now you don't have a choice.

1420
01:41:02.70 --> 01:41:04.58
You either walk on it or you die.

1421
01:41:04.58 --> 01:41:09.38
I think about the little things that are that caused you an inconvenience right now.

1422
01:41:09.38 --> 01:41:13.34
I think about what an inconvenience that is in this situation.

1423
01:41:13.34 --> 01:41:17.10
Think about your little infection and your fingers, you know, your finger, you're, you've

1424
01:41:17.10 --> 01:41:21.30
ever had one of those little stupid, like, where your fingernails get a little infection

1425
01:41:21.30 --> 01:41:22.30
there?

1426
01:41:22.30 --> 01:41:23.30
Yeah, yeah.

1427
01:41:23.30 --> 01:41:24.30
Think about that.

1428
01:41:24.30 --> 01:41:25.30
And that you don't have no medicine.

1429
01:41:25.30 --> 01:41:27.06
You don't have any way of, yeah, that's the things you're going to turn into

1430
01:41:27.06 --> 01:41:28.70
in giant infection.

1431
01:41:28.70 --> 01:41:29.70
Yeah.

1432
01:41:29.70 --> 01:41:30.70
You die.

1433
01:41:30.70 --> 01:41:36.70
This is the little, little tiny things that annoy you are, will kill you back in the

1434
01:41:36.70 --> 01:41:37.70
day.

1435
01:41:37.70 --> 01:41:38.70
Yeah.

1436
01:41:38.70 --> 01:41:39.70
Check.

1437
01:41:39.70 --> 01:41:40.70
Yeah.

1438
01:41:40.70 --> 01:41:42.34
So what we have to do is prepare for these hard times.

1439
01:41:42.34 --> 01:41:45.94
Do you have any advice on how we could help prepare ourselves for these hard times?

1440
01:41:45.94 --> 01:41:52.46
On top of referencing these scenarios.

1441
01:41:52.46 --> 01:41:53.86
I reference your guys scenario.

1442
01:41:53.86 --> 01:41:59.18
Like, basically, everything that you guys tell me and talk about, like, how it's super hot.

1443
01:41:59.18 --> 01:42:00.82
How you don't sleep as much.

1444
01:42:00.82 --> 01:42:03.18
I'm not talking about bad and talking about, like, Ian Ramadi.

1445
01:42:03.18 --> 01:42:04.18
I call these up.

1446
01:42:04.18 --> 01:42:06.46
I kind of imagine that helps.

1447
01:42:06.46 --> 01:42:07.46
It's coldly helps.

1448
01:42:07.46 --> 01:42:08.46
That's good.

1449
01:42:08.46 --> 01:42:10.70
Because it helps me to think about right from the Harris.

1450
01:42:10.70 --> 01:42:11.70
Yeah.

1451
01:42:11.70 --> 01:42:12.70
Don't.

1452
01:42:12.70 --> 01:42:13.70
For sure.

1453
01:42:13.70 --> 01:42:15.70
And to speak in a help.

1454
01:42:15.70 --> 01:42:17.70
Speaking of helping yourself.

1455
01:42:17.70 --> 01:42:18.70
All right.

1456
01:42:18.70 --> 01:42:23.26
So you're, in a way, this is kind of a dichotomy here.

1457
01:42:23.26 --> 01:42:25.10
Because you don't like when you're joined to get sore.

1458
01:42:25.10 --> 01:42:26.10
I'm talking about cruel.

1459
01:42:26.10 --> 01:42:29.82
I want to hear a fair real quick.

1460
01:42:29.82 --> 01:42:31.90
That you can be a self-pream luxury.

1461
01:42:31.90 --> 01:42:32.90
Yeah.

1462
01:42:32.90 --> 01:42:33.90
You're right from the Harris, you know.

1463
01:42:33.90 --> 01:42:34.90
Yeah.

1464
01:42:34.90 --> 01:42:36.90
So, Joy-Wiffer, who knows?

1465
01:42:36.90 --> 01:42:37.90
I have no thumbs.

1466
01:42:37.90 --> 01:42:39.34
I'm pretty sure it may be wouldn't stop that day.

1467
01:42:39.34 --> 01:42:40.34
That time.

1468
01:42:40.34 --> 01:42:41.34
It's a pretty luxury.

1469
01:42:41.34 --> 01:42:42.34
Yeah.

1470
01:42:42.34 --> 01:42:43.34
Supreme luxury.

1471
01:42:43.34 --> 01:42:45.66
Where now it's like, hey, my joints.

1472
01:42:45.66 --> 01:42:46.66
I'm getting older.

1473
01:42:46.66 --> 01:42:47.66
My joints kind of hurt.

1474
01:42:47.66 --> 01:42:48.66
I can't.

1475
01:42:48.66 --> 01:42:51.54
I can't work out at the gym.

1476
01:42:51.54 --> 01:42:54.02
You know, at my leisure.

1477
01:42:54.02 --> 01:42:56.90
As good, let me take some joint warfare.

1478
01:42:56.90 --> 01:43:00.70
You know, improve my comfort while I work out.

1479
01:43:00.70 --> 01:43:01.70
Function for sure.

1480
01:43:01.70 --> 01:43:02.70
Function.

1481
01:43:02.70 --> 01:43:04.54
But comfort has a lot to do with it.

1482
01:43:04.54 --> 01:43:07.98
You know, with sore joints is way less comfortable than not sore joint.

1483
01:43:07.98 --> 01:43:08.98
Yeah.

1484
01:43:08.98 --> 01:43:12.78
I'm going to say though, there's exercises that you cannot do when you're doing

1485
01:43:12.78 --> 01:43:14.42
it right at your rock and roll.

1486
01:43:14.42 --> 01:43:15.42
Yeah.

1487
01:43:15.42 --> 01:43:20.10
So, you can push yourself harder and be better prepared for the hard times if you're

1488
01:43:20.10 --> 01:43:21.10
working correctly.

1489
01:43:21.10 --> 01:43:22.90
If your joints are working correctly.

1490
01:43:22.90 --> 01:43:23.90
Yeah.

1491
01:43:23.90 --> 01:43:24.90
That's a dichotomy.

1492
01:43:24.90 --> 01:43:29.46
And there also is no like concession.

1493
01:43:29.46 --> 01:43:34.46
There's no reason to say, hey, my joints being less

1494
01:43:34.46 --> 01:43:36.94
healthy is a good is fine.

1495
01:43:36.94 --> 01:43:37.94
Is good.

1496
01:43:37.94 --> 01:43:38.94
That's a good thing.

1497
01:43:38.94 --> 01:43:40.26
You know, so you have a choice.

1498
01:43:40.26 --> 01:43:44.62
Should I maintain or improve the joint?

1499
01:43:44.62 --> 01:43:50.66
My joint health of my body, including but not limited to joints or should I not?

1500
01:43:50.66 --> 01:43:52.02
The decision should never be.

1501
01:43:52.02 --> 01:43:53.02
I'm not.

1502
01:43:53.02 --> 01:43:54.02
Never be.

1503
01:43:54.02 --> 01:43:55.86
I think that's what's my opinion.

1504
01:43:55.86 --> 01:44:00.26
Anyway, so the point is so jocquism supplements.

1505
01:44:00.26 --> 01:44:01.26
Joint.

1506
01:44:01.26 --> 01:44:02.26
So it's for your joints.

1507
01:44:02.26 --> 01:44:08.70
It's best kind of supplements as someone with a level head now is for a supplements

1508
01:44:08.70 --> 01:44:09.70
goes.

1509
01:44:09.70 --> 01:44:10.70
Go.

1510
01:44:10.70 --> 01:44:14.38
I think the joint for your joints.

1511
01:44:14.38 --> 01:44:18.26
You know, bones.

1512
01:44:18.26 --> 01:44:20.30
Maybe stuff that's going to be stronger.

1513
01:44:20.30 --> 01:44:21.30
Structural.

1514
01:44:21.30 --> 01:44:22.30
Yeah.

1515
01:44:22.30 --> 01:44:23.30
Structural support.

1516
01:44:23.30 --> 01:44:28.38
Because again, and I said, it's like if you're going for a cool protein

1517
01:44:28.38 --> 01:44:31.06
powder, a lot of people that say, hey, what's a good protein powder?

1518
01:44:31.06 --> 01:44:32.62
Because I think you don't stake.

1519
01:44:32.62 --> 01:44:38.78
Like how much protein do you like not get to need supplemental protein?

1520
01:44:38.78 --> 01:44:42.90
Well, people know, people want that because it's getting the convenience.

1521
01:44:42.90 --> 01:44:44.54
That's why people like those.

1522
01:44:44.54 --> 01:44:49.98
I'm going to make one that's going to be both convenient and tasty and good.

1523
01:44:49.98 --> 01:44:50.98
All right.

1524
01:44:50.98 --> 01:44:52.34
There you go.

1525
01:44:52.34 --> 01:44:53.82
Nonetheless, that's cool.

1526
01:44:53.82 --> 01:44:55.22
I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

1527
01:44:55.22 --> 01:45:01.02
I'm saying as far as like the importance of focusing on a supplement, the most benefit

1528
01:45:01.02 --> 01:45:05.06
is that you're spending your convenience that really.

1529
01:45:05.06 --> 01:45:06.06
For sure.

1530
01:45:06.06 --> 01:45:07.06
That supplementing protein.

1531
01:45:07.06 --> 01:45:08.06
You're supplementing convenience.

1532
01:45:08.06 --> 01:45:09.06
Nothing wrong with that.

1533
01:45:09.06 --> 01:45:10.06
Nothing wrong with that.

1534
01:45:10.06 --> 01:45:11.06
We got a lot to do.

1535
01:45:11.06 --> 01:45:12.06
I understand.

1536
01:45:12.06 --> 01:45:16.42
But as far as like the what do you call it, the hierarchy of supplements.

1537
01:45:16.42 --> 01:45:17.94
You're in the same change.

1538
01:45:17.94 --> 01:45:18.94
Jordan B. Peter's in supplements.

1539
01:45:18.94 --> 01:45:19.94
You're in the house.

1540
01:45:19.94 --> 01:45:23.06
The dominant hierarchy of supplements.

1541
01:45:23.06 --> 01:45:24.06
The the drill oil.

1542
01:45:24.06 --> 01:45:25.06
Omega threes.

1543
01:45:25.06 --> 01:45:29.74
Like these kinds of things that help you directly.

1544
01:45:29.74 --> 01:45:30.98
That's the main one.

1545
01:45:30.98 --> 01:45:31.98
Anyway.

1546
01:45:31.98 --> 01:45:34.98
So your point in all this is.

1547
01:45:34.98 --> 01:45:36.38
Just a supplement.

1548
01:45:36.38 --> 01:45:39.38
Legit supplements.

1549
01:45:39.38 --> 01:45:41.22
Super krill oil.

1550
01:45:41.22 --> 01:45:42.38
Jocco super krill is what's called.

1551
01:45:42.38 --> 01:45:47.70
It's krill oil for you joints and join warfare.

1552
01:45:47.70 --> 01:45:49.26
Where do you get them?

1553
01:45:49.26 --> 01:45:50.26
Origin main dot com.

1554
01:45:50.26 --> 01:45:51.26
Okay.

1555
01:45:51.26 --> 01:45:52.26
Thank you.

1556
01:45:52.26 --> 01:45:54.26
Brown, I'm telling you, I feel like.

1557
01:45:54.26 --> 01:45:56.70
Your drawing this out way too much.

1558
01:45:56.70 --> 01:46:01.62
If I was doing this to be like, if you want to have good healthy joints, get some

1559
01:46:01.62 --> 01:46:08.22
krill oil, super krill and get some joint warfare from originmain.com, M.A.I.N.E.

1560
01:46:08.22 --> 01:46:09.22
Yeah.

1561
01:46:09.22 --> 01:46:10.22
But, and then we'd be good.

1562
01:46:10.22 --> 01:46:11.22
We'd be moving on the next thing.

1563
01:46:11.22 --> 01:46:12.22
Yeah, no, I dig it.

1564
01:46:12.22 --> 01:46:14.42
And I want to read the time at the hierarchy.

1565
01:46:14.42 --> 01:46:15.42
Here's the thing.

1566
01:46:15.42 --> 01:46:16.42
The dominant number.

1567
01:46:16.42 --> 01:46:19.46
No, it's a little bit like, remember, and this makes sense.

1568
01:46:19.46 --> 01:46:20.46
This is relevant.

1569
01:46:20.46 --> 01:46:21.46
Your get all serious with me.

1570
01:46:21.46 --> 01:46:22.46
It's not going to prove you point.

1571
01:46:22.46 --> 01:46:23.46
Because you're not doing it.

1572
01:46:23.46 --> 01:46:24.46
I'm going to prove it because I'm not.

1573
01:46:24.46 --> 01:46:25.46
I'm going to prove it because I'm not.

1574
01:46:25.46 --> 01:46:26.98
Because back out of your element out of your.

1575
01:46:26.98 --> 01:46:32.10
Again, again, when I was, we'll say 23.

1576
01:46:32.10 --> 01:46:35.78
I don't know, take some fos for something.

1577
01:46:35.78 --> 01:46:36.78
Yeah, yeah.

1578
01:46:36.78 --> 01:46:37.78
I just got stuff.

1579
01:46:37.78 --> 01:46:38.78
Yeah.

1580
01:46:38.78 --> 01:46:39.78
Yeah.

1581
01:46:39.78 --> 01:46:45.26
So what if someone, listening, or group people listening, who have that same mindset,

1582
01:46:45.26 --> 01:46:48.02
and it's not because not because I knew both things.

1583
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:50.02
And I would just, I just didn't know.

1584
01:46:50.02 --> 01:46:51.02
OK.

1585
01:46:51.02 --> 01:46:52.06
So I'm going to say, now, so now we know.

1586
01:46:52.06 --> 01:46:52.86
Yeah, well, that's good.

1587
01:46:52.86 --> 01:46:55.38
If there's someone that doesn't know that, maybe they turn this off.

1588
01:46:55.38 --> 01:46:56.38
Like eight minutes ago.

1589
01:46:56.38 --> 01:46:59.54
Maybe maybe not four, maybe they're more educated now, and maybe boom.

1590
01:46:59.54 --> 01:47:02.14
They're now they're looking into the joint situation.

1591
01:47:02.14 --> 01:47:03.54
That's what I think is happening.

1592
01:47:03.54 --> 01:47:04.54
That's my opinion.

1593
01:47:04.54 --> 01:47:05.54
Hey, care.

1594
01:47:05.54 --> 01:47:06.54
That's my prediction.

1595
01:47:06.54 --> 01:47:08.22
I'm sure Twitter will let us know.

1596
01:47:08.22 --> 01:47:11.46
Anyway, the origin main.com on the top.

1597
01:47:11.46 --> 01:47:12.46
Click labs.

1598
01:47:12.46 --> 01:47:13.46
Actually, it's right in the front page.

1599
01:47:13.46 --> 01:47:14.46
I keep forgetting that.

1600
01:47:14.46 --> 01:47:15.46
It's right in the front page.

1601
01:47:15.46 --> 01:47:16.46
Boom.

1602
01:47:16.46 --> 01:47:17.46
Super curl.

1603
01:47:17.46 --> 01:47:18.46
Super curl.

1604
01:47:18.46 --> 01:47:19.46
And joint warfare.

1605
01:47:19.46 --> 01:47:20.46
Get on it.

1606
01:47:20.46 --> 01:47:21.46
There's also some geys and rash guards.

1607
01:47:21.46 --> 01:47:24.86
People been asking me years now.

1608
01:47:24.86 --> 01:47:25.86
I don't think I should get it.

1609
01:47:25.86 --> 01:47:26.86
I started to do this.

1610
01:47:26.86 --> 01:47:27.86
What geys should I get?

1611
01:47:27.86 --> 01:47:28.86
We know now.

1612
01:47:28.86 --> 01:47:29.86
We know now.

1613
01:47:29.86 --> 01:47:33.74
100% all made in America from the content from the seeds of the content.

1614
01:47:33.74 --> 01:47:35.74
Planted harvested process.

1615
01:47:35.74 --> 01:47:38.10
That's pretty much the seeds did do.

1616
01:47:38.10 --> 01:47:39.10
The seeds.

1617
01:47:39.10 --> 01:47:40.10
Yeah.

1618
01:47:40.10 --> 01:47:44.90
Well, that's an exciting thing.

1619
01:47:44.90 --> 01:47:45.90
I'm just saying.

1620
01:47:45.90 --> 01:47:46.90
Yeah.

1621
01:47:46.90 --> 01:47:47.90
If you're into that kind of stuff.

1622
01:47:47.90 --> 01:47:51.82
But nonetheless, you know, Pete makes it in Maine.

1623
01:47:51.82 --> 01:47:52.82
Formulate to the fabric.

1624
01:47:52.82 --> 01:47:53.82
Boom.

1625
01:47:53.82 --> 01:47:54.82
That's a lot of stuff too.

1626
01:47:54.82 --> 01:47:56.30
By the way, clothing.

1627
01:47:56.30 --> 01:47:59.70
Pete has more of like a stylish kind of twist on his clothing.

1628
01:47:59.70 --> 01:48:00.70
Yeah.

1629
01:48:00.70 --> 01:48:02.34
In fact, I always, who was it?

1630
01:48:02.34 --> 01:48:03.34
Oh, Dave Burke.

1631
01:48:03.34 --> 01:48:04.34
Yeah.

1632
01:48:04.34 --> 01:48:05.34
And we're in Utah.

1633
01:48:05.34 --> 01:48:06.34
Yeah.

1634
01:48:06.34 --> 01:48:07.34
Had the origin, the hoodie.

1635
01:48:07.34 --> 01:48:08.34
Yeah.

1636
01:48:08.34 --> 01:48:10.74
And the hoodie has like, I don't know if you know this kind of stuff.

1637
01:48:10.74 --> 01:48:14.46
But like, there's certain cuts of like hoodie and stuff.

1638
01:48:14.46 --> 01:48:15.46
And even though it's like a new one.

1639
01:48:15.46 --> 01:48:16.46
No, my cutters excel.

1640
01:48:16.46 --> 01:48:17.46
Yeah.

1641
01:48:17.46 --> 01:48:18.46
I see.

1642
01:48:18.46 --> 01:48:19.46
It goes beyond that.

1643
01:48:19.46 --> 01:48:20.46
No.

1644
01:48:20.46 --> 01:48:21.46
Yes, it does.

1645
01:48:21.46 --> 01:48:23.80
Anyway, Mike, you know, it's noticeable for people who want to know

1646
01:48:23.80 --> 01:48:24.80
this.

1647
01:48:24.80 --> 01:48:25.80
No, but I noticed that.

1648
01:48:25.80 --> 01:48:26.80
I'm going to get it.

1649
01:48:26.80 --> 01:48:27.80
That's good.

1650
01:48:27.80 --> 01:48:28.80
That's a good hoodie.

1651
01:48:28.80 --> 01:48:29.80
And just a pull over one.

1652
01:48:29.80 --> 01:48:30.80
You know, come on.

1653
01:48:30.80 --> 01:48:31.80
Dave.

1654
01:48:31.80 --> 01:48:32.80
Yeah.

1655
01:48:32.80 --> 01:48:33.80
It's something.

1656
01:48:33.80 --> 01:48:34.80
It's not nothing.

1657
01:48:34.80 --> 01:48:35.80
Nothing.

1658
01:48:35.80 --> 01:48:38.36
Nonetheless, it's all made in America.

1659
01:48:38.36 --> 01:48:40.12
And there is this little stylish twist.

1660
01:48:40.12 --> 01:48:41.52
If you're there, then notice.

1661
01:48:41.52 --> 01:48:43.48
If you care to notice.

1662
01:48:43.48 --> 01:48:45.48
It has some fashion style.

1663
01:48:45.48 --> 01:48:46.96
It's baked in there.

1664
01:48:46.96 --> 01:48:48.36
If you don't notice, you don't notice.

1665
01:48:48.36 --> 01:48:51.28
Cause you, you ever wore the, you wore the hoodie, right?

1666
01:48:51.28 --> 01:48:52.28
Functional.

1667
01:48:52.28 --> 01:48:53.28
Yeah.

1668
01:48:53.28 --> 01:48:56.24
I'm not used to 19 degrees.

1669
01:48:56.24 --> 01:48:57.24
Like it wasn't Utah.

1670
01:48:57.24 --> 01:48:58.24
Yeah, you weren't used to that.

1671
01:48:58.24 --> 01:49:00.28
I don't think you ever been in 19.

1672
01:49:00.28 --> 01:49:02.52
I was, but I had that hoodie on.

1673
01:49:02.52 --> 01:49:03.52
Help.

1674
01:49:03.52 --> 01:49:06.04
You guys had these big ass cortex jackets.

1675
01:49:06.04 --> 01:49:07.04

1676
01:49:07.04 --> 01:49:09.04

Nonetheless, all the stuff on origin main.com is made in America from season.

1678
01:49:13.48 --> 01:49:19.08
The cotton all the way to be final garment you wearing.

01:49:19.08 --> 01:49:20.08
Yeah.

1680
01:49:20.08 --> 01:49:21.08
Yeah.

1681
01:49:21.08 --> 01:49:22.08

Okay, bench squat, burpees, dead lifts.

What a basic one.

1686
01:49:38.40 --> 01:49:39.40
Yeah, you want to expand.

1687
01:49:39.40 --> 01:49:40.40

1688
01:49:40.40 --> 01:49:44.48
If you want to expand, do some like cool interest things stuff on it.com slash

1689
01:49:44.48 --> 01:49:45.48
jockel go there.

1690
01:49:45.48 --> 01:49:50.12

Those are cool.

1693
01:49:52.56 --> 01:49:55.04
But I think those are all the ones I have just artistic ones.

1694
01:49:55.04 --> 01:49:56.04
Jerk.

1695
01:49:56.04 --> 01:49:57.04

which keeps it fun.

1698
01:50:02.36 --> 01:50:04.16
For some people not jockel.

1699
01:50:04.16 --> 01:50:11.68
Some people though, if you vary the workout like new movements, functional movements,

1700
01:50:11.68 --> 01:50:15.36
if you will, you're more likely to stick with it.

1701
01:50:15.36 --> 01:50:16.36
Stay on the pattern.

1702
01:50:16.36 --> 01:50:18.88
Make the pattern jibble sometimes.

1703
01:50:18.88 --> 01:50:24.36
You'll just neglect the enjoyability of your workout.

01:50:51.08 --> 01:50:52.08
Boom.

1713
01:50:52.08 --> 01:50:54.24
There's a list of all the books by episode.

1714
01:50:54.24 --> 01:50:55.88
Click through there to get it.

1715
01:50:55.88 --> 01:50:57.36
It takes an Amazon.

1716
01:50:57.36 --> 01:50:59.08
And boom, good way to support.

1717
01:50:59.08 --> 01:51:03.000
If you want to do some other shopping while you're on there, like what?

1718
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.52
Modern Morris.

1719
01:51:04.52 --> 01:51:05.40
Golf clubs.

1720
01:51:05.40 --> 01:51:07.40
Golf clubs.

1721
01:51:07.40 --> 01:51:08.68
Podcast equipment.

1722
01:51:08.68 --> 01:51:10.52
Recently a lot of people have been hitting me up.

1723
01:51:10.52 --> 01:51:12.36
Same, hey, I'm going to start a podcast.

1724
01:51:12.36 --> 01:51:14.20
What's the equipment?

1725
01:51:14.20 --> 01:51:15.04
You know, I should get.

1726
01:51:15.04 --> 01:51:16.04
They asked me that too.

1727
01:51:16.04 --> 01:51:19.04
Yeah, I just talked.

1728
01:51:19.04 --> 01:51:21.04
You press record.

1729
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:22.04
Yes.

1730
01:51:22.04 --> 01:51:23.04
And I got the equipment.

1731
01:51:23.04 --> 01:51:26.04
So I have that knowledge.

1732
01:51:26.04 --> 01:51:28.04
Excited about that, are we?

1733
01:51:28.04 --> 01:51:33.04
So hey, having knowledge is better than not having the knowledge in whatever regard.

1734
01:51:33.04 --> 01:51:36.04
Nonetheless, if you're going to buy podcasts equipment, carry on.

1735
01:51:36.04 --> 01:51:37.04
Do that stuff.

1736
01:51:37.04 --> 01:51:39.04
But yeah, click through this.

1737
01:51:39.04 --> 01:51:41.04
Good way to support.

1738
01:51:41.04 --> 01:51:45.04
Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on Stitcher.

1739
01:51:45.04 --> 01:51:50.04
I, too, and obviously Google Play Spotify confirmed.

1740
01:51:50.04 --> 01:51:54.04
It seems weird that I didn't know that for sure.

1741
01:51:54.04 --> 01:51:55.04
It seems real weird.

1742
01:51:55.04 --> 01:51:57.04
Here's the thing.

1743
01:51:57.04 --> 01:51:58.04
So many things.

1744
01:51:58.04 --> 01:51:59.04
Not that weird.

1745
01:51:59.04 --> 01:52:01.04
We need to talk about it for eight minutes.

1746
01:52:01.04 --> 01:52:05.04
I was saying this is.

1747
01:52:05.04 --> 01:52:07.04
I guess, yeah, you know what, you're right.

1748
01:52:07.04 --> 01:52:08.04
It's just me expressing myself.

1749
01:52:08.04 --> 01:52:10.04
Look, all you got to know Spotify confirmed.

1750
01:52:10.04 --> 01:52:12.04
Two because out there confirmed it to me.

1751
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:13.04
Yeah.

1752
01:52:13.04 --> 01:52:17.04
That's really the good thing about people interacting.

1753
01:52:17.04 --> 01:52:18.04
Yes.

1754
01:52:18.04 --> 01:52:19.04
It is.

1755
01:52:19.04 --> 01:52:21.04
You learn a lot about yourself in your own situation.

1756
01:52:21.04 --> 01:52:23.04
They know things that you don't know.

1757
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:23.04
Yeah, yeah.

1758
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:23.04
Yeah.

1759
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:24.04
You know things that I don't know.

1760
01:52:24.04 --> 01:52:25.04
Because they're detached.

1761
01:52:25.04 --> 01:52:27.04
And they have different expertise, by the way.

1762
01:52:27.04 --> 01:52:28.04
In a lot of ways.

1763
01:52:28.04 --> 01:52:29.04
Most ways.

1764
01:52:29.04 --> 01:52:31.04
Anyway, subscribe.

1765
01:52:31.04 --> 01:52:33.04
If you haven't already, also subscribe on YouTube.

1766
01:52:33.04 --> 01:52:34.04
There's excerpts on there.

1767
01:52:34.04 --> 01:52:36.04
If you don't want to list, or if you don't want to,

1768
01:52:36.04 --> 01:52:42.04
necessarily watch the whole episode video version of this podcast.

1769
01:52:42.04 --> 01:52:44.04
You can just get little excerpts.

1770
01:52:44.04 --> 01:52:47.04
They can share watch or even come back to.

1771
01:52:47.04 --> 01:52:49.04
That's a big one.

1772
01:52:49.04 --> 01:52:50.04
Yeah.

1773
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:52.04
We've put out so much that it's too much.

1774
01:52:52.04 --> 01:52:55.04
People can't absorb it all the first time around.

1775
01:52:55.04 --> 01:52:56.04
Yeah.

1776
01:52:56.04 --> 01:52:57.04
Wait, what do you mean?

1777
01:52:57.04 --> 01:52:58.04
Like the whole episode?

1778
01:52:58.04 --> 01:52:59.04
No, no, no.

1779
01:52:59.04 --> 01:53:01.04
What was on episode 63?

1780
01:53:01.04 --> 01:53:02.04
Right?

1781
01:53:02.04 --> 01:53:04.04
People would people don't remember that thing.

1782
01:53:04.04 --> 01:53:05.04
Maybe.

1783
01:53:05.04 --> 01:53:07.04
So you just like to get to you go listen.

1784
01:53:07.04 --> 01:53:08.04
You learn it again.

1785
01:53:08.04 --> 01:53:09.04
And now it's more recognizable.

1786
01:53:09.04 --> 01:53:10.04
Yeah.

1787
01:53:10.04 --> 01:53:12.04
So it's like drilling a little bit.

1788
01:53:12.04 --> 01:53:13.04
Yeah.

1789
01:53:13.04 --> 01:53:14.04
No, I'm going to come back.

1790
01:53:14.04 --> 01:53:15.04
I'm going to drill so far.

1791
01:53:15.04 --> 01:53:16.04
Yeah.

1792
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:19.04
And something, you know how like certain things just apply to you more.

1793
01:53:19.04 --> 01:53:21.04
Like if you're, you're advice on, I don't know,

1794
01:53:21.04 --> 01:53:24.04
college that's easy when you remember about how to approach college.

1795
01:53:24.04 --> 01:53:25.04
Right?

1796
01:53:25.04 --> 01:53:26.04
Crash college or whatever.

1797
01:53:26.04 --> 01:53:29.04
It's going to apply to me more if I'm actually in college.

1798
01:53:29.04 --> 01:53:30.04
Yeah.

1799
01:53:30.04 --> 01:53:32.04
Let's just apply that to other things in life.

1800
01:53:32.04 --> 01:53:33.04
Which you can easily do.

1801
01:53:33.04 --> 01:53:34.04
You can.

1802
01:53:34.04 --> 01:53:35.04
For sure.

1803
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:36.04
But that's going to apply to me directly.

1804
01:53:36.04 --> 01:53:37.04
We'll say.

1805
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:39.04
You know, more than maybe the next guy.

1806
01:53:39.04 --> 01:53:42.04
So that kind of stuff where.

1807
01:53:42.04 --> 01:53:44.04
That one I want to remember.

1808
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:45.04
Okay.

1809
01:53:45.04 --> 01:53:46.04
I'm going to come back to that one.

1810
01:53:46.04 --> 01:53:50.04
If I can constantly remind myself of the things that directly apply to me,

1811
01:53:50.04 --> 01:53:55.04
you can be more, it's going to be more beneficial rather than just listening to all the podcast and hoping you remember each one.

1812
01:53:55.04 --> 01:53:56.04
Nonetheless.

1813
01:53:56.04 --> 01:54:00.04
Point there is that's that's a good reason to subscribe to the YouTube channel.

1814
01:54:00.04 --> 01:54:07.04
So if you, in fact, if the excerpts or some excerpts resonate with you.

1815
01:54:07.04 --> 01:54:10.04
You got him there. You fingertips and you can share.

1816
01:54:10.04 --> 01:54:12.04
Also.

1817
01:54:12.04 --> 01:54:15.04
Jocquoise is store. It's called Jocquoise store.

1818
01:54:15.04 --> 01:54:17.04
Jocquoise store.com. That's the URL there.

1819
01:54:17.04 --> 01:54:20.04
There. That's where you can get if you want.

1820
01:54:20.04 --> 01:54:21.04
Sure.

1821
01:54:21.04 --> 01:54:23.04
Do you don't even know what URL is any more?

1822
01:54:23.04 --> 01:54:24.04
Of course they do.

1823
01:54:24.04 --> 01:54:25.04
Do you think so?

1824
01:54:25.04 --> 01:54:27.04
I think that's common language.

1825
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:28.04
No.

1826
01:54:28.04 --> 01:54:28.04
Actually, no.

1827
01:54:28.04 --> 01:54:29.04
I think you're right.

1828
01:54:29.04 --> 01:54:30.04
You're actually called a website.

1829
01:54:30.04 --> 01:54:30.04
Website.

1830
01:54:30.04 --> 01:54:31.04
Yeah. The website.

1831
01:54:31.04 --> 01:54:33.04
What is your URL stand for?

1832
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:34.04
See, well, I don't even know.

1833
01:54:34.04 --> 01:54:35.04
See.

1834
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:37.04
You better forgot.

1835
01:54:37.04 --> 01:54:39.04
No, I'm actually not a tech guy.

1836
01:54:39.04 --> 01:54:41.04
Yeah, but you knew I was a little old man.

1837
01:54:41.04 --> 01:54:43.04
I knew what it meant.

1838
01:54:43.04 --> 01:54:45.04
I don't know what it stands for.

1839
01:54:45.04 --> 01:54:47.04
You know, I don't know.

1840
01:54:47.04 --> 01:54:48.04
Universal something?

1841
01:54:48.04 --> 01:54:49.04
Ask your brother.

1842
01:54:49.04 --> 01:54:50.04
I know.

1843
01:54:50.04 --> 01:54:52.04
It's probably not even universal.

1844
01:54:52.04 --> 01:54:53.04
J-trolls.

1845
01:54:53.04 --> 01:54:55.04
Nonetheless, it's Jocquoise.

1846
01:54:55.04 --> 01:54:58.04
The website is jocquoisestore.com.

1847
01:54:58.04 --> 01:54:59.04
I know.

1848
01:54:59.04 --> 01:55:00.04
Not that creative.

1849
01:55:00.04 --> 01:55:02.04
But, easy to remember.

1850
01:55:02.04 --> 01:55:04.04
That's where you can get the shirts.

1851
01:55:04.04 --> 01:55:08.04
Hoodies, rashguards, compression, rashguards, if you will.

1852
01:55:08.04 --> 01:55:12.04
We're very sectivities where you maintain your range of motion.

1853
01:55:12.04 --> 01:55:17.04
J-tjutsu specifically in my opinion.

1854
01:55:17.04 --> 01:55:19.04
Hoodies on their hoodies.

1855
01:55:19.04 --> 01:55:20.04
All the hoodies.

1856
01:55:20.04 --> 01:55:22.04
They're the same design, but though they're the heavy ones.

1857
01:55:22.04 --> 01:55:24.04
People ask me and ask me, like, are these the heavy ones?

1858
01:55:24.04 --> 01:55:25.04
Or where's the heavy hoodies?

1859
01:55:25.04 --> 01:55:26.04
Well, the the heavy ones.

1860
01:55:26.04 --> 01:55:27.04
The heavy ones.

1861
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:29.04
We saw like the non heavy ones.

1862
01:55:29.04 --> 01:55:30.04
We'll call them.

1863
01:55:30.04 --> 01:55:31.04
I thought they were heavy.

1864
01:55:31.04 --> 01:55:32.04
Yeah.

1865
01:55:32.04 --> 01:55:33.04
The first kind of iteration.

1866
01:55:33.04 --> 01:55:33.04
Exactly.

1867
01:55:33.04 --> 01:55:34.04
Where?

1868
01:55:34.04 --> 01:55:37.04
Those were all sold out.

1869
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:39.04
They sold out last year.

1870
01:55:39.04 --> 01:55:40.04
Yeah.

1871
01:55:40.04 --> 01:55:45.04
And so I did another iteration with your request for the heavy.

1872
01:55:45.04 --> 01:55:46.04
There they have the one.

1873
01:55:46.04 --> 01:55:50.04
Actually, I think there might be some industrial heavier ones.

1874
01:55:50.04 --> 01:55:51.04
Maybe.

1875
01:55:51.04 --> 01:55:54.04
No, because I think that was.

1876
01:55:54.04 --> 01:55:55.04
Then yeah, I don't know.

1877
01:55:55.04 --> 01:55:57.04
I forget nonetheless.

1878
01:55:57.04 --> 01:55:59.04
These are the heavy ones.

1879
01:55:59.04 --> 01:56:01.04
Confirm, double confirm.

1880
01:56:01.04 --> 01:56:03.04
Also, so women's stuff on there.

1881
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:09.04
I think I'm going to add a few things before Christmas on the store.

1882
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:10.04
That'd be good.

1883
01:56:10.04 --> 01:56:15.04
So if you want to keep your eyes on that, that's a good way to support.

1884
01:56:15.04 --> 01:56:17.04
If you want something, get something.

1885
01:56:17.04 --> 01:56:18.04
Check them out.

1886
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:19.04
Also, psychological warfare.

1887
01:56:19.04 --> 01:56:22.04
If you know what that is, I'm telling you it's an album with tracks.

1888
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:26.04
Jockel talking on these tracks.

1889
01:56:26.04 --> 01:56:32.04
Basically, you listen to them when you are on the path.

1890
01:56:32.04 --> 01:56:34.04
We'll say on the path.

1891
01:56:34.04 --> 01:56:36.04
And you get moments of weakness.

1892
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:37.04
Days of weakness.

1893
01:56:37.04 --> 01:56:39.04
You're not feeling like it.

1894
01:56:39.04 --> 01:56:41.04
You know how you always talk about it.

1895
01:56:41.04 --> 01:56:42.04
It doesn't matter if you feel like it or not.

1896
01:56:42.04 --> 01:56:43.04
You just do it.

1897
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:44.04
Yeah.

1898
01:56:44.04 --> 01:56:45.04
Okay.

1899
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:46.04
And I respect that.

1900
01:56:46.04 --> 01:56:48.04
And that's where we all want to be.

1901
01:56:48.04 --> 01:56:51.04
We all want to be there.

1902
01:56:51.04 --> 01:56:55.04
But for some of us, it's not like that.

1903
01:56:55.04 --> 01:56:56.04
You're a separate set of the time.

1904
01:56:56.04 --> 01:56:58.04
Sometimes when you really don't feel like it.

1905
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:01.04
Sometimes when I really don't feel like it.

1906
01:57:01.04 --> 01:57:03.04
I just don't do it, man.

1907
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:05.04
Sometimes they're going to be honest.

1908
01:57:05.04 --> 01:57:07.04
We'll put on psychological warfare and you'll do it.

1909
01:57:07.04 --> 01:57:08.04
Yes.

1910
01:57:08.04 --> 01:57:10.04
It's like a spot.

1911
01:57:10.04 --> 01:57:11.04
You know, especially a spot.

1912
01:57:11.04 --> 01:57:14.04
This is where it's like a no brainer.

1913
01:57:14.04 --> 01:57:16.04
Really easy.

1914
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:18.04
When you're like contemplating.

1915
01:57:18.04 --> 01:57:21.04
I could just do this tomorrow, right?

1916
01:57:21.04 --> 01:57:22.04
And you start making deals with yourself.

1917
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:23.04
You ever do that?

1918
01:57:23.04 --> 01:57:25.04
No deals with myself.

1919
01:57:25.04 --> 01:57:26.04
No deals with the weak part of it.

1920
01:57:26.04 --> 01:57:27.04
It's like you don't.

1921
01:57:27.04 --> 01:57:29.04
It's a straight up.

1922
01:57:29.04 --> 01:57:30.04
Jockel.

1923
01:57:30.04 --> 01:57:31.04
No deals.

1924
01:57:31.04 --> 01:57:32.04
Jockel.

1925
01:57:32.04 --> 01:57:33.04
Like I don't feel like it.

1926
01:57:33.04 --> 01:57:34.04
I feel like it.

1927
01:57:34.04 --> 01:57:35.04
Whatever.

1928
01:57:35.04 --> 01:57:37.04
That makes me angry.

1929
01:57:37.04 --> 01:57:39.04
I get pissed at myself.

1930
01:57:39.04 --> 01:57:41.04
If I start leaning towards.

1931
01:57:41.04 --> 01:57:43.04
Like, maybe I just want to do anything.

1932
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:44.04
No, oh, really.

1933
01:57:44.04 --> 01:57:45.04
Really.

1934
01:57:45.04 --> 01:57:46.04
How is that?

1935
01:57:46.04 --> 01:57:47.04
That's how.

1936
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:47.04
Okay.

1937
01:57:47.04 --> 01:57:48.04
Cool.

1938
01:57:48.04 --> 01:57:49.04
Wanna go smash?

1939
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:50.04
You know, it's real funny.

1940
01:57:50.04 --> 01:57:51.04
I would.

1941
01:57:51.04 --> 01:57:52.04
That doesn't surprise.

1942
01:57:52.04 --> 01:57:55.04
I'm not going to be like, I'm going to be like,

1943
01:57:55.04 --> 01:57:58.04
I'm going to be like, I don't know if we can kind of do that.

1944
01:57:58.04 --> 01:58:00.04
Then you get this sort of look.

1945
01:58:00.04 --> 01:58:02.04
This kind of way about you kind of like.

1946
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:02.04
So wait.

1947
01:58:02.04 --> 01:58:03.04
That's how it's.

1948
01:58:03.04 --> 01:58:05.04
I'm going to be going on vacation.

1949
01:58:05.04 --> 01:58:08.04
And he's going to be gone for a couple weeks.

1950
01:58:08.04 --> 01:58:11.04
And I've been real busy with all kinds of stuff.

1951
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:17.04
And we were talking about if we'd be able to actually get all these podcasts done.

1952
01:58:17.04 --> 01:58:20.04
And I didn't think we could do it.

1953
01:58:20.04 --> 01:58:24.04
And so I said, hey, I got you know, we're just going to have to take, you know, no, no podcast for a few weeks.

1954
01:58:24.04 --> 01:58:29.04
And then then I said, actually, like a day went by.

1955
01:58:29.04 --> 01:58:33.04
And I said, I said, I said, echo a text that said, actually, we're going to do it.

1956
01:58:33.04 --> 01:58:34.04
Yeah.

1957
01:58:34.04 --> 01:58:35.04
And we're going to record all the podcasts.

1958
01:58:35.04 --> 01:58:36.04
I'm going to prep for them all.

1959
01:58:36.04 --> 01:58:38.04
We're going to have an all-nighter.

1960
01:58:38.04 --> 01:58:39.04
And we'll just get it done.

1961
01:58:39.04 --> 01:58:42.04
Bring some red bull and get some.

1962
01:58:42.04 --> 01:58:44.04
Bring some joc a white tea.

1963
01:58:44.04 --> 01:58:45.04
Yeah.

1964
01:58:45.04 --> 01:58:49.04
Well, what was interesting about that is when you said that,

1965
01:58:49.04 --> 01:58:52.04
you had this kind of tone of like dang, like,

1966
01:58:52.04 --> 01:58:54.04
term it like we got to take a break.

1967
01:58:54.04 --> 01:58:56.04
We got to take a break after two years, by the way,

1968
01:58:56.04 --> 01:58:58.04
every single week, by the way.

1969
01:59:00.04 --> 01:59:01.04
We got to take a break.

1970
01:59:01.04 --> 01:59:02.04
That's what you said.

1971
01:59:02.04 --> 01:59:03.04
Yeah.

1972
01:59:03.04 --> 01:59:06.04
And right when I was like, cool, I dig it.

1973
01:59:06.04 --> 01:59:08.04
No, I mean, I'm not saying good.

1974
01:59:08.04 --> 01:59:09.04
I'm saying cool.

1975
01:59:09.04 --> 01:59:10.04
I totally understand.

1976
01:59:10.04 --> 01:59:12.04
And you know what that makes sense.

1977
01:59:12.04 --> 01:59:14.04
HBO.

1978
01:59:14.04 --> 01:59:16.04
Big company.

1979
01:59:16.04 --> 01:59:18.04
Takes huge breaks.

1980
01:59:18.04 --> 01:59:19.04
Everybody takes huge breaks.

1981
01:59:19.04 --> 01:59:20.04
Everybody takes huge breaks.

1982
01:59:20.04 --> 01:59:21.04
Yeah.

1983
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:22.04
A pair.

1984
01:59:22.04 --> 01:59:27.04
And you're over here two years in no breaks, no breaks, no matter what.

1985
01:59:27.04 --> 01:59:28.04
Okay.

1986
01:59:28.04 --> 01:59:30.04
So they'll come a time when we are forced to for some reason.

1987
01:59:30.04 --> 01:59:31.04
Yeah.

1988
01:59:31.04 --> 01:59:32.04
That's kind of part of the point.

1989
01:59:32.04 --> 01:59:33.04
Right?

1990
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:34.04
So I'm like cool.

1991
01:59:34.04 --> 01:59:35.04
I dig it.

1992
01:59:35.04 --> 01:59:36.04
I totally understand.

1993
01:59:36.04 --> 01:59:37.04
Jocco.

1994
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:40.04
And when I said that, that's one of your face kind of shifted,

1995
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:43.04
like kind of you went into your own world.

1996
01:59:43.04 --> 01:59:44.04
Like did I just say that?

1997
01:59:44.04 --> 01:59:46.04
Like it's almost like you sort of got mad.

1998
01:59:46.04 --> 01:59:47.04
Russel.

1999
01:59:47.04 --> 01:59:49.04
I was like, oh, we're not taking a break.

2000
01:59:49.04 --> 01:59:53.04
I know Jocco's gonna come back.

2001
01:59:53.04 --> 01:59:55.04
Nonetheless, and I'm sure that'll, okay.

2002
01:59:55.04 --> 01:59:56.04
So I dig it.

2003
01:59:56.04 --> 01:59:59.04
But back to psychological warfare.

2004
01:59:59.04 --> 02:00:09.04
If you need a spot or even want a spot with those times that you're like,

2005
02:00:09.04 --> 02:00:10.04
maybe I'll skip the work.

2006
02:00:10.04 --> 02:00:11.04
Maybe I'll slip in the dive.

2007
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:13.04
I mean, just listen to any track.

2008
02:00:13.04 --> 02:00:15.04
And the track is labeled, you know, where.

2009
02:00:15.04 --> 02:00:19.04
If you can skip on the diet, it's like sugar coated like weight.

2010
02:00:19.04 --> 02:00:20.04
What is it?

2011
02:00:20.04 --> 02:00:21.04
Sugar coated like.

2012
02:00:21.04 --> 02:00:23.04
But it's something something's sugar coated like sugar coated like.

2013
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:24.04
It's just sugar coated like.

2014
02:00:24.04 --> 02:00:25.04
Yeah.

2015
02:00:25.04 --> 02:00:26.04
So you listen to that.

2016
02:00:26.04 --> 02:00:29.04
And then what's good is it's not some inspirational.

2017
02:00:29.04 --> 02:00:30.04
And you can do it.

2018
02:00:30.04 --> 02:00:32.04
It's not that it's like, it's pragmatic.

2019
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:33.04
I hear to do that.

2020
02:00:33.04 --> 02:00:34.04
Well, here's the thing though.

2021
02:00:34.04 --> 02:00:38.04
You, but just by nature, you're tone of voice kind of kind of like,

2022
02:00:38.04 --> 02:00:42.04
by happens, stands inserts that concept in it.

2023
02:00:42.04 --> 02:00:44.04
So it's kind of a double, double thing.

2024
02:00:44.04 --> 02:00:48.04
It turns out, but primarily it's just a pragmatic thing.

2025
02:00:48.04 --> 02:00:50.04
Think about think about this.

2026
02:00:50.04 --> 02:00:52.04
Logical stuff.

2027
02:00:52.04 --> 02:00:54.04
And then at the end of the track, you kind of conclude that,

2028
02:00:54.04 --> 02:00:55.04
Oh yeah.

2029
02:00:55.04 --> 02:00:56.04
It's going to get after it.

2030
02:00:56.04 --> 02:00:57.04
Yeah, exactly right.

2031
02:00:57.04 --> 02:00:59.04
That's what psychological warfare is.

2032
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:01.04
It is on iTunes.

2033
02:01:01.04 --> 02:01:02.04
Amazon music.

2034
02:01:02.04 --> 02:01:03.04
Google play.

2035
02:01:03.04 --> 02:01:04.04
Whatever you can get,

2036
02:01:04.04 --> 02:01:05.04
and be three.

2037
02:01:05.04 --> 02:01:06.04
True story.

2038
02:01:06.04 --> 02:01:07.04
A bit of support.

2039
02:01:07.04 --> 02:01:12.04
Also, you get Jocquite and if you're having trouble dead lifting less than 8,000 pounds,

2040
02:01:12.04 --> 02:01:14.04
if you get Jocquite T, that will be solved immediately.

2041
02:01:14.04 --> 02:01:17.04
And your deadlift will then be 8,000 pounds,

2042
02:01:17.04 --> 02:01:20.04
including Jordan B. Peterson, who can now deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2043
02:01:20.04 --> 02:01:22.04
He broke through his 7,000 pounds.

2044
02:01:22.04 --> 02:01:23.04
Yeah.

2045
02:01:23.04 --> 02:01:24.04
Cappereeer.

2046
02:01:24.04 --> 02:01:24.04
Yeah.

2047
02:01:24.04 --> 02:01:25.04
Buryer.

2048
02:01:25.04 --> 02:01:26.04
Bucks.

2049
02:01:26.04 --> 02:01:27.04
I got some books.

2050
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:29.04
Way the warrior kid.

2051
02:01:29.04 --> 02:01:30.04
Number one.

2052
02:01:30.04 --> 02:01:32.04
Don't let your kid be a winpy kid.

2053
02:01:32.04 --> 02:01:33.04
Why would you do that?

2054
02:01:33.04 --> 02:01:35.04
Why would you let your neighbors kid be a winpy kid?

2055
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:36.04
Why would you do that?

2056
02:01:36.04 --> 02:01:38.04
Get him on the path.

2057
02:01:38.04 --> 02:01:40.04
Way the warrior kid path.

2058
02:01:40.04 --> 02:01:41.04
Stronger.

2059
02:01:41.04 --> 02:01:41.04
Faster.

2060
02:01:41.04 --> 02:01:42.04
smarter.

2061
02:01:42.04 --> 02:01:43.04
Better.

2062
02:01:43.04 --> 02:01:44.04
Get some extreme ownership.

2063
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:51.04
The new addition is out and thanks to you all because we added questions.

2064
02:01:51.04 --> 02:01:58.04
Your questions from this podcast into an appendix inside.

2065
02:01:58.04 --> 02:02:01.04
Not every question, but a bunch of them.

2066
02:02:01.04 --> 02:02:02.04
A good amount.

2067
02:02:02.04 --> 02:02:03.04
So they're in there.

2068
02:02:03.04 --> 02:02:06.04
There's also new forward and some new color pictures.

2069
02:02:06.04 --> 02:02:07.04
Color pictures.

2070
02:02:07.04 --> 02:02:08.04
Interesting.

2071
02:02:08.04 --> 02:02:09.04
Yeah.

2072
02:02:09.04 --> 02:02:10.04
Because I don't like color pictures.

2073
02:02:10.04 --> 02:02:11.04
I said no.

2074
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:12.04
That caught on me.

2075
02:02:12.04 --> 02:02:13.04
They said, well, this is more premium.

2076
02:02:13.04 --> 02:02:16.04
I said, no, black and white is premium.

2077
02:02:16.04 --> 02:02:18.04
It's a gift.

2078
02:02:18.04 --> 02:02:23.04
So anyways, if you want to see what I look like in color, then you can get the book.

2079
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:26.04
But to offset that, I said, okay, fine.

2080
02:02:26.04 --> 02:02:27.04
You want to put color pictures in there.

2081
02:02:27.04 --> 02:02:28.04
Make the whole book black.

2082
02:02:28.04 --> 02:02:29.04
So that's what they did.

2083
02:02:29.04 --> 02:02:31.04
Make the whole book black.

2084
02:02:31.04 --> 02:02:33.04
And that was that.

2085
02:02:33.04 --> 02:02:35.04
And speaking of black also.

2086
02:02:35.04 --> 02:02:39.04
The disponibles freedom field manual is available.

2087
02:02:39.04 --> 02:02:46.04
And I told you about that tagline that the publisher wanted to have like,

2088
02:02:46.04 --> 02:02:49.04
the, this book is a superb gift for holiday season.

2089
02:02:49.04 --> 02:02:52.04
And I told them no.

2090
02:02:52.04 --> 02:02:57.04
The tagline is there's no better gift than discipline.

2091
02:02:57.04 --> 02:02:58.04
That's the truth.

2092
02:02:58.04 --> 02:03:00.04
You know, it's actually true.

2093
02:03:00.04 --> 02:03:04.04
If you could give someone the gift of discipline, would you not be giving them the best gift in life?

2094
02:03:04.04 --> 02:03:05.04
Yes.

2095
02:03:05.04 --> 02:03:08.04
Now you can actually give them the gift of discipline equals freedom field manual.

2096
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:09.04
So you can do that.

2097
02:03:09.04 --> 02:03:14.04
Now this is important because people keep asking me the field manual.

2098
02:03:14.04 --> 02:03:15.04
Audio version.

2099
02:03:15.04 --> 02:03:19.04
Dispening goes for you and field manual is it is also on iTunes.

2100
02:03:19.04 --> 02:03:22.04
Amazon use a Google play other MP3 platforms.

2101
02:03:22.04 --> 02:03:23.04
It's available right now.

2102
02:03:23.04 --> 02:03:25.04
It is not on audible.

2103
02:03:25.04 --> 02:03:27.04
Audible is not with tracks.

2104
02:03:27.04 --> 02:03:29.04
We wanted an album with tracks.

2105
02:03:29.04 --> 02:03:31.04
So why we did it this way.

2106
02:03:31.04 --> 02:03:37.04

2116
02:04:15.04 --> 02:04:23.04
slogging through the mud and the heat and the danger and the fear.

2117
02:04:23.04 --> 02:04:29.04
Thank you for defending us and our freedoms and to the police law enforcement firefighters,

2118
02:04:29.04 --> 02:04:40.04
paramedics, other first responders, thanks for living the life that you live, which allows us to live the life we live.

2119
02:04:40.04 --> 02:04:43.04
And to everyone else, that's listening.

2120
02:04:43.04 --> 02:04:46.04
Just remember that you might not be wearing a cape.

2121
02:04:46.04 --> 02:04:51.04
You might not have any magic powers, but you have the ultimate power.

2122
02:04:51.04 --> 02:04:55.04
And that is human will.

2123
02:04:55.04 --> 02:05:06.04
The power to march to fight to overcome and to get after it.

2124
02:05:06.04 --> 02:05:11.04
So until next time, this is echo and jockel.

2125
02:05:11.04 --> 02:05:27.04
Out.
