so I love that one if you wait for things to happen to you they certainly will little bit more on will power here then you must have undonited will power the will power is the motive power it is what enables you to make yourself fit in mind and body to produce in you in your heart the courage the enduring courage that I spoke of to give you the courage to do your duty and to make the sacrifice that may be called from you it is the will power that forces you to take the initiative to make the plan to do what is required to see it through and that will power must be undonited it must never allow itself to be overcome or subdued perhaps the finest example living today of the power and influence for good of man with undonited will power is our prime minister in one of the critical periods of the last war he spoke certain words I am going to quote you now he said all the great struggles in history have been won by superior will power resting victory in the teeth of odds or upon the narrowest of margins it is the will power that is superior that can rest victory in the teeth of odds that is the type of will power that has got to be developed in a leader on the battlefield mobilize your will now he talks about some other qualities he talks about knowledge he talks about judgment he talks about team spirit saying because you cannot get success on the battlefield by yourself you've got to work with other people so obviously as a leader you have to have that spirit of teamwork and closing out he says there's one other thing I would like to say to you as british officers you will never have all you want all you need you'll be short of this or that or the other sometimes you will be short of men other times your equipment or weapons may not be as good as you think they ought to be normally you have as many as you would like you may be short of ammunition you may also be short of food and water or other necessary things when these circumstances arise as they do often throughout your service both in peace and war there's only one motto and that is to make certain that you do the very best you can with what you got don't belgate about what you have not got but get on and make certain you do your utmost with what you have got now to sum up what I've tried to say this afternoon I would like to put it like this first keep fit absolutely fit then be honest honest with yourselves and honest with those with whom you work then have courage and make it an enduring courage next be bold be daring and when there's a choice take the bold and daring course make the very most of what you have got and never never never give in yes do what you can with what you've got until you really like but there's all section on discipline we'll get to all right now we're going to talk we're going to hear from General John Hackett again World War II African campaign it's part of Market Garden which is the big airborne operation for World War II then here's what he says I am a soldier in speaking of leadership I do so as a soldier and when I think about it as any soldier often must I do so in the context of battle pressures in battle are high and in battle as a consequence the problems of leadership stand out in bold relief and that's something very similar to what I say which is combat is like life amplified and intensified wrote that an extreme ownership and that's what I'm talking about and because it's that way it's very easy to identify what's going on with the leadership it's a very the the the problems of leadership stand out in bold relief he said it better than me back to the book but while battle may be unique the problems that it exposes are not right yes leadership problems and have been working for seven years with other companies and people that are not going to battle and guess what the problems that battle exposes are not unique to battle for leadership is concerned with getting people to do things and as most keenly needed when difficulties doubts and dangers are at their greatest in whatever sphere this is attempted the problems are essentially similar so anytime you got a team you got trying to make and do something the problems are pretty much going to be similar back to the book I said that leadership was concerned with getting people to do things what I meant was getting them to do things willingly so we don't want to just park orders of people that doesn't work doesn't work in business doesn't work on the battlefield will it work for five minutes and if I can't explain it to you in a logical way then I should rethink what I'm saying to you so Mr. John Fordiskew we're going to have to say that we've kind of changed our opinion on on obedience and there are more important things than obedience in a team in a military team and in the business world here's another piece from the Sconeback General Williams slim any army without discipline is no more than a mob alternating between frightened sheep and beasts of prey discipline as the British soldiers demonstrated in peace and war is the old Christian virtue of unselfishness of standing by your neighbor your comrade it is the sacrifice of a man's comfort inclination safety even life for others for something greater than himself it is the refusal to be the weak link in the chain that snaps under under strain then this is a great little story here one paragraph back to the book once from the safety of a well dug command post I looked down on a battery vault artillery in action in the African bush it was firing at five rounds per gun per minute and idly I timed the nearest gun in that area the enemy unfortunately had complete local air supremacy and guns unless engaged in some vital task were ordered to remain silent whenever hostile aircraft appeared gradually dominating all other sounds came the dull drone of bombers flying low but the guns went on firing five rounds per gun per minute for they were supporting an infantry attack cover move by the way the first stick of bombs fell around the gun I was watching some of its crew were hit the dry brush roared into flame which spread instantly to the camouflage nets over the gun it vanished from my sight in smoke and flame yet from the very midst of that inferno at the exact intervals came the flash and thud of the firing gun five rounds per minute per gun never a falter never a second out no weak link there the discipline held that's pretty awesome sections here talking about duty and service and we're going to first start with Colonel George Henderson a British officer who fought in Egypt and at the Battle of Kassassin and he fought in the Boer Wars as well and he talks about waterloo here we go back to the book no incidents more familiar in our military history than the stubborn resistance of the British line at Waterloo through the long hours of the mid-summer day silent and immovable squares and squadrons stood in the trampled corn harassed by an almost incestant fire of cannon and musketry to which they were forbidden to make reply not a moment but heard some cry of agony not a moment but some comrade fell headlong into the furrows yet as bullets of the skirmishers hailed around them and the great shot tore through the tight packed ranks the word was passed quietly closing on the center men and as the sun neared at setting the regiments still shoulder to shoulder stood fast upon the ground they had held at noon the spectacle is characteristic in good fortune and in ill it is rare indeed that a British regiment does not hold together and this indestructible cohesion best of all qualities that an armed body can possess is based not merely on hereditary resolution but on mutual confidence and mutual respect the man and the ranks has implicit faith in his officer the officer and almost unbounded belief in the valor and discipline of his men and that I've talked about this and people want to know what makes the seal teams do well the thing that makes the seal teams do well is the bond that holds them together and that bond is so strong that it's unbreakable and that's why seals do well in combat because we have a bond that is unbreakable stronger than anything that's going to get thrown at us the brotherhood is going to stand and I'm going to close this book out with two more quotes and speaking of water this one is from Wellington and this is a very simple quote he said my rule was always to do the business of the day in the day and I I was reading this book the other day and I actually posted something about it and I believe it to be the highest type because it has to be exercised under conditions of great difficulty and considerable danger I would like to be quite I would like you to be quite clear about the conditions under which you will have to exercise leadership you will frequently be tired you may also be cold and wet and hungry and thirsty you may be dripping with sweat or you may be freezing with cold you won't know precisely what is going on you won't know exactly where the enemy is you certainly won't know what he is going to do or what his capabilities are of doing anything you may not know where your own people are or what they are going to do to put it briefly you've got to be able to exercise leadership in conditions of fatigue and fear uncertainty and ignorance and often in isolation that is what makes it extremely difficult and that is why leadership on the battlefield calls in my view for the highest qualities many qualities are required and leader different people have different views about which are more important in my opinion there are five outstanding mental and physical moral and spiritual qualities without which you cannot hope to be successful and a good leader on the battlefield the first of those qualities is a mental and physical one and that is fitness absolute fitness of mind and body so make sure you're getting your morning physical training in physical fitness mental fitness next then I would say you've got to have complete integrity you've got to be honest not only with yourselves but with the men you lead and the people with whom you work and honesty and integrity are things that you cannot compromise with you cannot alter if you do you will lose confidence and you will not be able to lead you must have complete integrity so that's the same thing as being straight not after that not in any next after that not in any order of priority right I'm sure it's been said to me before more like an admit like not a administrative situation I don't know if anyone's ever said it to me before like that's an order I don't know if I'm trying to think of there's been some situation where someone said to me like hey basically like you've pushed far enough jocco stand down like I got one of those before like hey we get it jocco but you can't fly if you're the buddy you can't be just looking at the attack board you have to look around attack board the attack board you can't that's what we call the attack board so with all that the reason I'm telling you all this is that when you're underwater it's really easy to get confused and turned around and sometimes you go over big pieces of metal that are in the water and your compass starts to like wander around and you can't communicate with your buddy man that's what it sounds like you've got so we know we have squeeze signals and sometimes we carry grease pens to write but it's never there's no real effective way to communicate underwater so you're just in this dark just cold blind situation for three two three four hours at a time and the saying is that we have is plan your dive and dive your plan because if you and I go underwater and then we start trying to adjust things while we're underwater and we just we think we're going to do something different once we go first of all you and I're going to be thinking two different things and it's going to be a disaster so we plan our dive and dive our plan and that's reminded me of this statement do the business of the day in the day right get done what you say you're going to get done do it and how simple is that all right next there's a chapter in this book which is called discipline which makes me very happy and again I tried to censor myself from not just doing the entire chapter obviously you can buy this book if you want to see the whole thing there's a great point this first one is from field marshal Earl Wavel who was in the blue wars and he was in World War I in World War II lost his left eye in the battle of e-brays so we're talking a warrior here that was went back for service here's what he said about discipline discipline is teaching which makes a man do something which he would not unless he had learned that it was the right the proper and the expedient thing to do at its best it is instilled and maintained by pride in one's self in one's unit in one's profession only at its worst by fear of punishment so he's talking we want self discipline we don't want in post discipline that's what he's saying you don't want I don't want you doing this because you're scared of me if you don't do what I tell you I'm gonna beat you that's not what I want I want you saying I'm gonna do this because I want to do it here's a little something from Monti here and we're gonna get some disagreements going I'm gonna disagree with Monti you know I was listening I was listening to our podcast and what we're talking about we're talking always talking about watching people in the news and that's a classic situation where you know you got somebody on a three minute segment and one person is you know the hardcore in this direction the other person is the hard corner of the direction they both care they both care a lot neither one of them is going to win they actually that that goes the next that's the next realization is that if you're going up against person that cares as much as you do you actually have to take a back step and find another way you have to flank them because you're not going to be able to win them by going ahead dead they care as equal to to you so you've got to find a new solution otherwise you know what you'll do expand all your ammunition charging machine gunnests and you'll die yeah pulling rank on you that's not a good not a good situation back to the book never overlook failure to carry one out so it's never given unnecessary order never overlook failure to carry one out some people have to chime in with their opinions on that one never overlook failure to carry one out I'm not sure on that one what does that mean to carry one out that's what I'm saying I don't know it says it says never order troops to do what you're not prepared to do yourself never given unnecessary order never overlook failure to carry one out to carry out an order yeah to carry one out never overlook failure to carry one out I'm not sure what he means by that just do book I'm sure some people will give us some opinions on that one on the Facebook you when I release keep fit yourself and make certain that your men do too keep your own nerves under control and study your men's good for like when you want to comment if you're listening and you want to comment you have an opinion on that one put it on the Facebook post so it can follow the conversation as opposed to Twitter which is 140 characters you don't know me yeah it's guys are all uh got all kinds of experience about much more intense than mine speaking of intense experience more than mine there's a guy a pseudonym meaning a fake name basilisk in the guy wrote something called talks on leadership and the guy's actual name was Alfred Bern and he was a world war one and world war two veteran then he was a military historian and he's got a little section in here it's called being straight there's one trait in the character of a leader that above all things really counts and it perhaps counts in war even more than in peace being straight no amount of ability knowledge or cunning can ever make up for not being straight once those under him find out that a commander is absolutely straight in all those dealings with them and free from the slightest trade of self interest other than the self interest of which we are all guilty when striving for victory of causes we believe to be right they will love him as their leader trust him work for him follow him and should the occasion arise die for him with the fundamental ability of the British soldier which comes to the surface when things are at their worst so being straight with your people very important very important in fact perhaps his most important above all so now we got another fact or that's the most important thing now I'm gonna hear a little on leadership from field martial lord harming once again world war one and world war two veteran he also fought in the second battle of al-amine he was a wounded lost some fingers recovered got back to the fight oh I like this one refrain from jealousy resentment and self-seeking be tactful never make friction be thoughtful and consider it but maintain firm discipline think about how bad this thing about the dichotomy of that be thoughtful and consider it but maintain firm discipline never order troops to do what you are not prepared to do yourself never give an unnecessary order that's a good one think about that one never give an unnecessary order and I'll tell you why I like that one is because if you're doing a good job as a leader orders should barely even be necessary they should barely even be necessary I talked about this with life the other day I mean I'm sure we could go back through you know the history of tasking of bruiser but as we we were having a conversation we were working with a company I don't think I ever gave an order to either one of my two Patoon commanders either life or the Delta Patoon commander I don't think I ever said this is what you're going to do that's an order like you see in the movies I think they do it when that causes freedom so when the cause is freedom I believe men will fight without the bonds of discipline over them and this idea that the best form of discipline is the subordination of self for the benefit of the community I don't actually agree without one either I think the best form of discipline is when there is alignment in the discipline the discipline for the team and the individual bring success and survival and freedom and when those things are aligned that's when I think you get the finest form of discipline now he recovers a little bit from my criticism here and of course to everyone that is wondering why I'm sort of making fun of myself it's pretty embarrassing to be sitting here and disagreeing with a guy like Monti so please don't take me the wrong way just giving my opinion here and I'm in no way comparing my military knowledge with general Montgomery and he doesn't say this the basis of all discipline is self discipline which this is beautiful when I agree with that 100% this self discipline may come from within a person or may be imposed upon him from without don't agree not only last a little while whatever it's or it involves the idea of self control and self restraint that is true but there is I think it's called situational discipline I think or what is that I could I could have the expression wrong and then you get on a bike you got to watch out that you don't get speeding tickets because you're gonna be going a little faster than the speed limit that's the joccal weight tea also on amazon you can get away the warrior kid and this review here of way the warrior kid also verified purchase review from

defy is bookie echo is at echo Charles and i am at jokko willink and thanks to everyone for listening to the podcast go out wake up earlier work out harder read more make yourself better a better soldier a better sailor better airman or a better marine a better police officer a better firefighter a better paramedic make yourself a better engineer or janitor or waitress or waiter or lawyer or doctor or car mechanic or builder make yourself a better person a better leader every day and as Charlie may said on July 1st 1916 before he went over the top into the raging hell that was the battle of the song he said it is a glorious morning and it certainly is all of the mar every morning is glorious so get out there and get after it and until next time this is echo and jokko out no actually not true I want to take the extreme version I want to stay alive I'm 2000 feet up I want really badly to stay alive it doesn't matter I can't get across that section I can't don't have the hand strength to do it not happening but they're making a movie about that I can't wait to see it about Alex Honoled climbing that rock Jimmy Chen is the famous kind of photographer guy that they went and documented the whole thing and apparently one of the articles said that during that crux moments Alex Honoled was like hey when we get to here just like back off with the cameras he apparently was like you know just back off the cameras when I go through you know section 94 alpha because I think he thought he didn't need any cameras around real close when he might fall to his death it's bad oh didn't yet the the author is Michael Powell and here's the thing it's not like it's not like a typical book where it's like talks about anger management it's not that it's it's literally like there's little games like mine brain exercises in there you know it's just everything and you know I I think that's a good way to wrap up that book because like we said those two quotes always do the business of the day in the day so plan what you do and do what you plan and dogs you cursive rascals would you live forever let me answer that for you know you won't and we're here talking about a book we talk about a book today and we talk about leadership and that's awesome well it depends on your weakness right or what kind of person you are so you know me if you say a echo wake up at 430 for one year every morning one year there's going to be a day or two where it's going to be harder than you know I don't know the day so put on the track what time do you wake up that's classified so it's you have problems I can't predict that's like a noon I woke up at noon on Saturday and it's still looking at you with the same expression because it's you know kettlebells because it's an ain't even an object you know because you get into the workout you know you know especially like how you you like it's a challenge every time you do that all right on it support yeah or just set your plan right give yourself those parameters but you won't it's it even me thinking about it right now it really after you can explain to there it really puts it into perspective and all the things you ever I mean you're different than I think I think a lot of people where sometimes people only make plans if like they have important stuff something that's important I got work stuff but one I again the where will forms so and Joe Rogan's on one of the videos on there he kind of mentions is he's like I like this one because it's like I think it's like the gorilla or something like that he's like it looks at you we're we're feeling pretty good about this one a short list to leadership given as follows perfect your military knowledge study the use of weapons their tactical handing the enemy's character and methods and way to make use of ground so I don't care what job you're in apply those right know your tools know the enemy know your competitor next study the man on your command know them well and be known to them gain their confidence by your knowledge energy and skill and by your interest in their welfare always be cheerful with them and I just want to choose your avenue also YouTube subscribe to our YouTube channel so we do have YouTube channel talk about every week but not only does it have the video version of this podcast has excerpts and deluxe excerpts what are those excerpts that you have enhanced we'll just say enhanced steps excerpts also you know what man I have this other idea you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make little we'll just say other little videos too that's what I'm gonna do step-ad value so to speak I like that it's the next video is always just like it's a 90% relevant to what you specifically want right there and that is why that is why you got to get angry at though you know you know if you have that uh you know how you have that that way that you ever came your anger management right but this is how I have put them down deep in my mind there is an enduring courage pretty well everyone can be brave for a few minutes most of us can if we steal ourselves to it take one pledge or make one decision or incur one risk but the sort of courage you must have to lead on the battlefield isn't enduring courage and one that you will go that will go on when other people falter one that will enable you to do what you know to be right irrespective of the danger or the difficulty contrary often contrary to the advice of well meaning friends so got to have courage next then you must have daring initiative initiative means doing right away what you might if you had time think of doing a few minutes later I like this if you wait for things to happen to you they will happen I think that's probably why you know like nowadays like contemporary companies they incorporate like you know, Jade's company, Frank Maldi got fuzball. right I got this to do this there's like 10 things on the list which actually seems like a pretty big to do this if you think 10 in one day you know how many things you do in a day that you can get distracted from a lot of them you know it's like it's more of a life but if you don't plan it they come in it's kind like whatever there's no parameters there anyway in my head so that goes for everything you do so just like how you're saying yeah have a lot of stuff but some of them are like you know two three four pages of peoples of views on leadership of which I'm pulling out some of the highlights and interestingly for the first time I was going through some of this and I was like you know what I'm actually it was something that I've said a million times cue work out the best methods of control in different tactical situations practice them constantly study the situation carefully don't waste any time make up your mind and stick to it get out your orders quickly make certain that everyone clearly knows what you intend to be done commander's intent maintain the initiative make opportunities and seize them at once I like that make opportunities why do I like that don't wait for them to come be prepared to take risks but don't be foolhardy know your commander's intention and act in accordance with it don't wait for orders in action is always wrong so there you go this is just reiterating things that I talk about all the time never take counsel of your fears think of the enemies difficulties and how you can take advantage of them remember that it is will power that wins and you have to concentrate the whole time and you got to make sure you don't go to shallow or too deep if you go too shallow you'll be seeing if you go to deep your go off the dive tables that you're allowed to be on oxygen for so you got to focus the whole time and by the way you're in a spare and your buddy that's with you he's even more miserable than you are because he has no idea what's going on he's just trying to keep up with you because for some reason the way you dive the way you put your body when you have the attack board you can swim a little bit faster than the guy that's looking around and making sure that you're not going to hit anything and make sure not so there's only one attack board there there's a one attack board for it prepare however you may feel teach yourself to think out reasoned appreciations leading to clever but uncomplicated plans quickly and unheardly so there you go keep things simple know your people get the I like to know your people get them to know you too so if you want to get after it get the discipline equals freedom field manual not a lot of fluff in there I'm gonna tell you that right now not a lot of fluff straightforward of course we got the book extreme ownership is the book we refer back to a bunch on here combat leadership for your life for your business for your school for your family for you own it and for your business or your team you can get us echelon front leadership management consulting to help bring leadership at your team to the next level that is life-bavin who wrote extreme ownership with me that is JP to now that is Dave Burke both those guys have been on the podcast to work both with those both those guys extensively in the battle or a mighty and myself also at echelon front yeah because you might think oh I'll get there at five a clock in the morning I've been there for an hour you might think I'm gonna have my guys drill this ten times I'm gonna have my guys drill it twenty times I care about this too much for you to win you can't beat me you can't beat me it's not gonna happen I care about this too much non-to-bad way non-to-selfish way I care about this I love this this is everything to me yeah I guess the only the only place where it becomes problematic is if I care about something you know at 97 level 97 you care about with the the opposite decision you're also at level 97 now we got an issue now we got a problem because we're both going to think we're going to win so I'm gonna make some comments on those number one when you say that you should obey orders regardless of what they are don't agree I don't agree with that I want my men to question my orders I want them to if I'm telling you to do something that they don't think is smart I want them to question me I want them to come up with then a better solution that's how we're gonna win even the moral thing too right like to obey orders regardless I'm not cast down change plans adapt back to the book no now no man can inspire confidence in others who is not confident in himself and self confidence comes from knowledge a thorough understanding of modern weapons and organization tactics and the details of administration affecting all those under his command must therefore be acquired by every leader he must show his troops that he can plan soundly lead resolute and deal promptly and effectively with the unexpected in addition to gain full confidence of his troops a leader must have their personal friendship and trust I like that again I've there was a there was a seal off so that once was briefing guys and said if you guys if you guys if you if your people like you they then they uh you're not doing a good job in not true but I was like you know what today's the day I'm gonna do I'm gonna this is gonna be the workout this is so my workout was you know you want numbers like you think you're gonna you know you think you're gonna outperform my task unit I care about this so much I don't care I care about this so much you're not gonna be able to compete with me yeah more than 10 it's like a lot and that goes everything everything from like the sweat the day you wake up or not the day but the time you wake up what you eat every single time by the way oh the TV watcher don't watch I get every second of the day if it had a parameter on it and you'd be just laser focus on all your goals instead of these ambiguous who or what I think if you stop now your brain might harden back up eventually do the same thing with her muscles like you're eating like chips or some way too many chips like you're muscle getting like all soft and and he said that the person that cares the most wins and that's a great statement and it's very true it's not 100% true put the the the percentage is very high up there because if I just care about something so much and I'm going to drive with it further than you if I care about this decision more than you do I got a really good chance of winning really good chance of winning yeah kind of seem to like that translates into any goal
