00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 101.
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 Good evening, echo.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000 Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000 Second Lieutenant Bernard Wilfrid Long was a smart young man
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000 who went to Birmingham University at age of 16.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000 Back in 1912.
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 He was commissioned in the West Yorkshire Regiment
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000 in January of 1916.
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000 And Bernard or burn, as his family called him,
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000 served in World War I in France.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000 And he wrote this letter to his father in early August of 1916.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000 He said,
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000 we've been having it awfully wet here during the last day or two.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000 And my word, talk about mud.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000 It's simply awful.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000 I get into mud up to my knees.
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000 I can take a sporting risk as well as any of them.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000 And shells have got no fear for me.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000 I've seen great big burly chaps who do nothing but curse and drink
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000 and get down and pray like a child when there's a bombardment on.
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000 And they don't care who sees them and no one dares to joke about it.
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 I've just heard from a palamine from Brockton who went down to the som
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000 when I came here and he says he's been over the lids seven times
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000 in attacks on the boge line.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000 Pretty awful that, isn't it?
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000 And I marvel. He's alive to tell the tale.
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000 He wrote another letter to his mother on August 11, 1917.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000 I am off by an early train tomorrow for the rest of Bill.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000 It's behind the firing line where we shall be for a time to get to know our men.
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000 Etc.
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000 I am going up with two pals and we are all pleased.
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000 I shall think of you all while I'm up there and know you won't forget me.
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 We're fighting hard now and it's a serious game.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000 We're already to lay down everything if need be.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000 And if God wills, I'm ready.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000 So goodbye and wish me luck.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000 You're loving son, burn.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000 And second lieutenant Bernard Wilford Long was killed in action at age 21.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000 At the Battle of Langmark on August 16, 1917,
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000 400 men from his battalion went into action.
00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:04.000 All 10 of the officers from the battalion died along with 264 of the men.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000 On September 11, 1918,
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000 there's another young man, Sergeant David Kerr, an American who dropped out of Columbia University to fight in World War I.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:33.000 He sent a letter to his mother the day before the attack on St. Miel in France.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:46.000 And he wrote, tomorrow the first totally American drive commences and it gives me inexpressible joy and pride to know that I shall be present to do my share.
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000 Should I go under, therefore, I want you to know that I went without any terror of death.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000 And that my chief worry is the grief, my death will bring to those so dear to me.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000 Since having found myself and Mary, there has been much to make life sweet and glorious.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000 But death, while this tasteful, is in no way terrible.
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000 I feel wonderfully strong to do my share well.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000 And for my sake, you must try to drown your sorrow in the pride and satisfaction.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000 The knowledge that I died well and so clean a cause as his arms should bring you.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000 Remember how proud I have always been of your superb pluck.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000 Keep Elizabeth's future in mind and don't permit my death to bow your head.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000 My personal belongings will all be sent to you.
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Your good taste will tell you which to send to Mary.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000 May God bless and keep you dear heart and be kind to little Elizabeth and those others I loved so well.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000 David, the end.
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000 And while the Americans actually broke through the German lines in the attack,
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:29.000 they suffered 7,000 casualties in 72 hours of fighting and 20 year old David Kerr was among the dead.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000 And that attitude that attitude where death is not feared.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000 We can find examples of it in so many different places.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000 A great example is from the American Civil War,
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000 from a man by the name of Sullivan, Baloo.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:15.000 Now, after the Battle at Fort Sumper, in 1861, President Lincoln called on the states to form up militia troops to put down the rebellion.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000 And Sullivan Baloo, who was born in Rhode Island, was one of those volunteers.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000 And he was commissioned a major in the second Rhode Island Infantry Regiment.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000 He was third in command.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:42.000 And the second Rhode Island Infantry Regiment moved to Washington and joined the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia.
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.000 And on the 14th of July 1861, from Washington, Sullivan wrote his wife a letter.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000 And here are some excerpts from that letter.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000 My very dear Sarah, the indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days, perhaps tomorrow.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000 Last I should not be able to write you again.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000 I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000 And it may be one of severe conflict and death to me.
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000 Not my will, but vine, oh God, be done.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000 If it is necessary that I should fall in the battlefield for my country, I am ready.
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:49.000 I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:03.000 I know how strongly American civilization now leans upon the triumph of the government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the revolution.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.000 And I am willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this government, and to pay that debt.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:31.000 But my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys, I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.000 When, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:09:01.000 Is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle and fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country?
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:16.000 I cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night when 2,000 men are sleeping around me. Many of them enjoying their last perhaps before that of death.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:29.000 And I, suspicious that death is creeping behind me with his fatal dart and communing with God, my country, and you.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:39.000 From my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but the omnipotence could break.
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:52.000 Then yet, my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with these chains to the battlefield.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:05.000 The memories of blissful moments I've spent with you come creeping over me. And I feel most gratified to God and to you that I've enjoyed them so long.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:23.000 And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes, the hopes of future years when God willing we might still have lived and love together and seen our sons grow up honorable to manhood around us.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:40.000 And I know but few small claims upon divine providence but something whispered to me. Perhaps it is wafted, perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:55.000 I do not my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you. And when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:20.000 Forgive my many faults in the many pains I have caused you. How fottless and foolish I have oftentimes been, how gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness and struggle with all the misfortune of this world to shield you and my children from harm.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:41.000 But I cannot, I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you while you buff at the storms with your precious little freight and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:12:00.000 Oh Sarah, if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they love I shall always be near you. In the garish day and in the darkest night amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours always.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:18.000 And if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek it shall be my breath or if cool air fans your throbbing temple it shall be my spirit passing by.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:36.000 Sarah do not mourn me dead think I am gone and wait for thee for we shall meet again. As for my little boys they will grow as I have done and never know a father's love and care.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:48.000 Little Willie is too young to remember me long and my blue eye to Edgar will keep my frolics with him amongst the dimmest memories of his childhood.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000 Sarah I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000 I call God's blessing upon them. Oh Sarah I wait for you there.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:15.000 And lead to me and lead thither my children Sullivan.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000 And on July 21st 1861 the regiment took part in the first battle of bull run.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:40.000 And as one of the senior officers Sullivan went in front on horse back to direct his men and he was hit by a cannon ball that tore off his right leg and also killed his horse.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:56.000 And he died from his wound a week after the battle while the prisoner of the Confederate army at age 32.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:14.000 And again an individual obviously prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. And we know that the enemy can be equally prepared to die.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:33.000 Clearly from the Kamakaze pilots from Japan in World War II. One of those young Kamakaze pilots was named Yukiyo Araki.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:45.000 And he was a member of the 72nd Shinbu Squadron. And he wrote this letter Dear Father and Mother.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000 I trust you and my brothers are doing well recently.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000 It has been decided that I will go at last to take part in the Battle of Okinawa as a member of the Special Attack Forces.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.000 I am deeply moved. I only look forward to sinking a ship with a single blow.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000 When I look back I apologize for not being devoted to you in any way for some ten years to this day.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:25.000 Through teaching by various senior officers after I entered the army I now devote myself to my country as a Special Attack Force member.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Please find pleasure in your desire for my loyalty to the Emperor and devotion to parents.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000 I have no regrets. I just go forward on my path.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000 I ask that you teach my three brothers so they can serve our country as noble airmen.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:57.000 I sincerely hope that you take good care of yourselves and make strunnures efforts on the home front.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000 Please give my regards to all my relatives and to everyone in the neighborhood association.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000 Sayonara.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000 Yukiyo Araki.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And he did indeed die at the age of 17 in the suicide attack on American ships near Okinawa on May 27, 1945.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:37.000 And the Japanese also imposed their willingness to die on their people.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:51.000 And here is a description of that brutal imposition from American sailors from the Journal of an American Sailor named James Fahey,
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000 who served on the USS Montpire in the Pacific.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000 And this is what he wrote on November 10, 1943.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000 This afternoon we came across a raft with four live japs in it.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000 As the destroyer Spence came close to the raft, the japs opened up with machine gun at the destroyer.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000 The jap officer then put the gun in each man's mouth and fired,
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000 blowing out the back of each man's skull.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000 One of the japs did not want to die for the Emperor and put up a struggle.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000 The others held him down.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000 The officer was the last to die.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000 He also blew his brains out.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000 The Spence went into investigate.
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000 All the bodies had disappeared into the water.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000 There was nothing left but blood at an empty raft.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000 Swarms of sharks everywhere.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000 The sharks ate well today.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000 We went to battle stations.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000 And at 10pm we were attacked by enemy planes.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000 Later darkness descended.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000 And the rains came.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:29.000 And just coming off the episode that we did.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000 With Musashi who obviously overcame his fear of death.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000 And I got a book in the mail from Japan.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000 And the book was called The Hundred Rules of War.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000 It's from someone in Japan named Eric.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000 Eric Shahhan, who turned out to be the actual translator of this book.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 And he's translated a bunch of other Japanese books on martial arts.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000 And he asked me if this book The Hundred Rules of War.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000 If any of the rules inside this book apply to modern warfare.
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000 And I read through the book and I read the book.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000 And it came to a very clear answer that yes.
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000 Not only do many of the rules in the book apply to modern warfare.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000 They also apply to life in general like many of the rules that I talk about.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:43.000 And this book The Hundred Rules of War, which by the way only has 97 rules in it.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000 But the book was originally written by Sukahara.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000 Book would end.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000 Who lived from 1489 to 1571.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000 So that's actually before Musashi's lifetime.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000 Because Musashi was born.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000 They say in 1584.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000 So this book predates Musashi.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000 And there's actually multiple revisions on this book.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000 It's interesting people would get it and add something to it over the years.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000 There was a forward written to the book in the mid 1600s.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000 By Takawan Soho.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000 And then there was an after-word written by one of the grandchildren of Boca-den students.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000 And there's another section.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000 The first eight lines in the book that were added.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000 And those are attributed to Shogun Yoshimune.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000 And he's a Shogun that ruled the Japan from 1716 until 1745.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000 So this book is very interesting.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000 And since Eric who sent it to me is obviously fluent in Japanese.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000 I'll apologize of course for my bad Japanese pronunciation.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000 But we'll go for it.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000 I'll want to take you through some of the sections of this book that again,
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:23.000 I feel not only applied to combat today, but to life today.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000 And interestingly, here's the, we'll start off a little bit with the introduction.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000 And this is again written by, written after the original book came out.
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000 And this guy added this introduction to it.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000 And he's describing how great the book is.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000 It's a little bit of arrogance in this, but it's okay.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000 Because he's saying hey, he's not saying he wrote it.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000 He's saying look, this book is important.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000 And here we go to the book.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000 If you change out the people, if you change out the words, if you change out the places,
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000 and if you change out every generation, it is like the difference between rain,
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000 do snow and ice.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000 They reach you for them to buy the same water.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000 That's interesting.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000 Right? Because now we're talking about people.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Hey, you can be different times, different places, different surroundings.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000 But it's like the difference between rain and dew and snow and ice.
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000 It's the same water, the same people are the same.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000 Back to the book.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000 These words should be read by any and everyone who follows the way of the warrior.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000 Speak them aloud so that you may hear them in your ears and fail to heed them at your peril.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000 They're not simply words to rever and praise.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000 If you are attempting to equate the teachings within this scroll to any other work,
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000 know that this is knowledge that can be found only after summoning the tallest peak of a mountain.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000 The depth of the wisdom contained on these pages makes the sea seem shallow by comparison.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000 If you were a compare person, versed in these ideas to a stone, you would find the latter soft by comparison.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000 Pull a bowstring, launching an arrow, or pulling a bowstring, launching an arrow, raising your whip,
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000 encouraging your steed, dawning your armor, taking up your lance, gaining fame and honor,
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000 becoming one who starts a great house, read this book, listen to it.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000 Understand the unmistakable truths.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000 It would be utterly foolish to not lock them in your mind.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000 In my opinion, even if you lived through a hundred generations over a thousand years,
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000 coming across another book like this, would be like to a blind turtle who comes to the surface once every hundred years,
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000 climbing its way into a hole on a piece of driftwood.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000 I like that.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000 Now, as we jump into this book, there's one more thing I need to mention.
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000 I said that there's these additions kind of to the book over time.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000 Well, one of the additions to the book, I mean, this book is written in the 1500s,
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000 but one of the additions to the book, and this is something that Eric added,
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:24.000 that he found a translation of the book by a researcher and a practitioner of the sword arts.
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000 And this guy's name was Hori Shogi, and he produced the text, and he put little helpful interpretations,
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000 kind of furthering the idea a little bit.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000 So I'll read those sometimes because it gives a little bit of clearification as to what's being talked about.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:52.000 And these first eight lines are actually, I'll give it up for these first eight lines in this book being fairly epic, fairly epic.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000 And again, these were written by Tokugawa Shogun Yishimuni.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.000 And again, he was the Shogun ruler of Japan from 1716 to 1745, and here's what he added to the book.
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:19.000 I think these are, well, here's number one, you cannot have pleasure without pain, and you cannot have pain without pleasure.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000 Your struggles now will be rewarded in the future, so you must endure.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000 Right?
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000 Yes.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000 Kind of speaks for itself, does it not?
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:46.000 In fact, I think we call that discipline, it goes freedom. Next, be reverent towards the law, be afraid of fire, be afraid of thoughtless,
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.000 dedlusional people, and never forget to be reverent to those you owe a debt of gratitude to.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000 This is one of those things that what do we say now, never forget where you came from, right? People say never forget where you came from.
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000 So don't forget those people that got you there, because where you came from, somebody helped you along the way.
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:14.000 And so don't forget about that. Next one, you should think of greed and lust as the enemy.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:30.000 Hmm, concur. I think I like this one. You should neither sleep late nor talk too long. Now, I guess I'm kind of the talk too long.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000 I may be violating that on the regular basis, at least once a week on a podcast.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000 Yes, me too sometimes.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000 Actually, you might violate that on the regular.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:48.000 But here's the guy, don't sleep late. And you know, I get this all the, every time I, every time somebody talks to me about sleeping, someone says,
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.000 Why have the night shift or while I work late, my kids don't go to bed until midnight. Okay, I get it.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000 I'm not saying everyone in the world has to wake up at 430.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.000 Yeah, what I'm saying is that you shouldn't sleep late, right? And if you work at night shift, not sleeping late might be waking up at noon, right?
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000 Yeah, but you didn't oversleep as my point.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000 Yeah, it's the idea just like I said, like, we all want to like stay cozy and are been and kind of take our time.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000 Right, yeah, it's the idea for sure. That's what I get from anyway.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000 It's not the mandatory. Yeah, 430. And if you don't wake up at 430, you're black or something. Yeah, like someone someone, someone,
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000 So I had picture my hand on the interweb, right? And I had a little callos get removed. Sure on the pull up bar.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000 And I'm the pull up bar. Yeah, but someone someone said, Hey, if someone doesn't have callos, they don't work out.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:00.000 And then someone else said, Well, what if you run a marathon, he still work out. And so, you know, it's the point is get some right kids can you get some while training for a marathon? Yes,
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000 Can you get some on a run your marathon? Yes, you can look at look at Rob Jones.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000 Yeah, he just ran 31 marathon. Yeah, everyone days. Yeah, that's getting some. We're not accusing him of not working.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Yeah, Matt, it is lack of callos. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. All right, next.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000 Take care to organize even trivial things. Then if something major occurs, it will not catch you off guard.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:35.000 So that's the little things that matter. Attention. You know, you're not doing no military. We need to join the military. I joke about it. They make you fold your underwear in like a four by four inch square.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:47.000 And that's the thing. They're trying to teach you attention to detail because actually I was talking to Marine buddy mine. I think it was, I want to say it was Morgan.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:58.000 Yeah, and they were, they landed their hellow and the gunner, whoever was in charge of the weapon, cracked off a 50 cow round into the, well, so you have a 50 cow
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:08.000 mounted in the helicopter, guy cracked off around he, if a weapon gets hot, it can just shoot. Okay. Yeah, yeah, if a weapon is really hot, it's called a cook off.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000 You've got a round in the chamber and the weapon's hot and it can just make that round go off from what the what anything.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:24.000 Just well, no from hot. If it's hot, well, you're shooting it. Okay, if it's hot inside then you add you shoot it a bunch. And now it gets hot. There's a hot round sitting in the chamber.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Yeah, and a minute goes by or you can know him. You know how long it's going to be. It could be five minutes, but boom, all of a sudden it just fires.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000 Yeah, and this, so before in this particular case, I'm not sure the weapon system, it was a 50 cow. But I'm not sure where they had it mounted.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000 But anyways, he should have cleared it before he folded it up into the helicopter and he didn't do that.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:57.000 And so he pulled the rounds out, but there's one round sitting in the chamber and sure enough it cooked off. So that's the kind of thing where they're trying to get you to pay attention to the small details.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.000 Yeah.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000 The trivial things.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.000 Yeah.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000 Because the trivial things aren't too trivial.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000 Yeah, did they do they explain that to you? Like when you're folding you underwear, do they explain, okay, then you know, that all they do.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:20.000 They do, and I've talked about this before on the podcast that my drone instructor in, in Officer candidate school. At the end of Officer candidate school, he explained why on everything.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000 At the end.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000 At the end.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Oh, like Mr. Mayaldi.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000 No, no, of course.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000 No, while you're doing it though, they'll be saying, how can you, you can't even fold your underwear, not right. How can we trust you with a weapon system?
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000 Yeah.
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000 They'll say that kind of thing to you.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:44.000 But you don't really, when you're, when I was going through regular boot camp, you're just, you're, your mind is being transformed from civilian world to military world. So you're not, you don't have good perspective.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.000 Yeah.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000 You know, you're like weapon system man.
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000 I just want to eat the next meal.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000 Yeah.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000 You're, you're not, you can't see the big picture.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000 I mean, I, I couldn't. I was too young or too dumb or a little bit of both.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000 Yeah.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000 But they do. They're saying, hey, how could you, how could you, how could you trust, how could you,
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000 how could you, fly an airplane, if you can't even fold your underwear right, boy.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000 You're, you're actually thinking, well, damn, maybe I shouldn't be flying an airplane.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000 I can't fold my underwear right.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000 Yeah.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000 But they're trying to teach you attention to detail. And it is good.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000 And it does apply to everything.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000 You know, it does apply to everything.
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And you do the little things right. And that way, the little things are in order.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000 And that means the big things, even if they catch a little off guard, you're at least prepared for it.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000 Yeah.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000 Yeah. That whole thing, I mean, I, I dig it, you know, how they're talking to you guys like that.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000 But that whole thing where, how do you expect to do this when you can't even, you know, tire shoes right or whatever, you know, like,
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000 like, say, or you don't bind to that, I don't know.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000 I do.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000 What I, I don't know.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000 It's good.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000 You're like, how are you going to, because a lot of things, it's like a false little equivalency there.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 Something, there's telling you to pay attention a little thing.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000 Yeah.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000 I get attention to detail.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000 I get that part of it for sure.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000 But I'm saying, like, if it's, hey, they're not explaining why.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000 I don't, and it could be wrong.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000 Well, they're explaining why, but they're doing it.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000 They're not doing, they're not breaking it down.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000 Right.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000 You know, like a school teacher is right.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000 Okay. Well, this is echo Charles.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000 Let me tell you why this is important.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000 I'm not doing that.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Yeah.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000 That's something like that.
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000 No, they're not, they're saying, hey, they're, they're getting it.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000 Yeah.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000 How can we trust you with a rifle if you can't fall during the war right?
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000 Yeah.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000 Okay.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000 And, and I would say this, maybe I didn't see the big picture, but I at least saw the little picture.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000 Yeah.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000 Well, that's, you know, the thing ultimately, like, you know, like, and I mentioned,
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000 Mr. Mia, like, uncrout credit kit, right?
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000 Where he's like, wax on wax off.
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000 You know, and he's like, oh, this is so dumb then at the end, he gets the picture, you know,
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000 but as he's doing it, I mean, he didn't say, you know, if you can't send the floor,
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000 how are you going to, why then the term, and nothing like that?
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000 Well, he was teaching him some kind of technique allegedly.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000 Right.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000 But that's essentially what they're doing as far as attention to detail.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000 They're making you do all these little, you did, too.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000 That would make you, there's nothing.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000 I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff that's there in foot lock pieces of wood.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000 Yeah, but that's pretty, like, that's an obvious translation, you know, like,
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000 like, I'm gonna foot lock something.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000 It's like punching a punching bag, you know, same thing.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.000 Yeah.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000 Through just two.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000 First check.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000 All right, going to the next one.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000 90% is not enough.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000 Only 100% will keep disaster at bay.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000 That's good.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000 Now, of course, many times, I'll say, hey, 80, you got an 80% solution.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000 Go.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000 Right.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.000 Yeah.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000 Because people sit around and wait for the right hand.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Good plan now.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000 Which, so I think that's a little bit different, but this, I think if you're talking about effort,
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000 yeah.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000 Right.
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000 The effort has to be 100%.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Yeah.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000 We're not gonna give 100%.
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000 And it's a settling thing, too, right?
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000 You know, people like, you don't, don't, like, set, you know, don't tell
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000 for 90%.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000 But it's 100% is required.
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000 Exactly.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000 Yeah.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000 That's what I get from it.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000 Next, having good judgment also means being able to endure.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000 There you go.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000 In your take pain.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000 And it's not just pain.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000 It's also being able to take just, just, just, just, just, just comfort.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000 And just comfort.
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000 Like, like, how many people don't want to do a job, just because it's, just because it's
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000 grueling and not fun.
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000 Yeah.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000 Right.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000 Right here.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000 A lot of people fall back at a point.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000 Not right now currently, obviously, but, you know, in general, yeah, that's my channel.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000 I had a tooth from for the most part.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000 Sometimes.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000 What was the worst, most medial job that you really hated?
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000 My worst job that I really hated was being a mover at American whippers on a wall
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000 and a hole in a hole.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000 For the summer, but then you get a little bit.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000 What?
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000 Like, like, hey, man, I'm gonna move this thing really fast.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000 No.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000 No, not at all.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000 It was like, moving.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000 And for other people all day, like, and it was bad as like 13 hours a day, average.
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000 I work on.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000 I, every time I, when I work construction and the first day on the job site, the, the guys
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000 came into the Wendy's.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 I work at Wendy's.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000 Sure.
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000 And the guys looked at me and the, in this, all the time guy, builder.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000 He looks at me goes, what are you doing here?
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000 And I said, I'm making rent.
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000 He says, you want to work here?
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000 I said, no, sir.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000 He said, you want to work construction with me?
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000 I said, yes, sir.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000 He said, but report tomorrow, wherever a cracker they were building the place right across
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000 the street.
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000 Yeah.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000 I said, yes, sir.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000 So I showed up there in the morning.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000 And there was a dump truck had come with a ton of concrete block to, that we're going to build
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000 a little foundation wall.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000 And they just dumped it, you know, 100 yards away.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000 All these concrete blocks.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000 Yeah.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000 And he says, hey, your job today is to move these blocks.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000 Over to get them over here near the foundation thing.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000 And he said, we're going to get some coffee and some donuts.
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000 Sure.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000 Yeah.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000 Donuts.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000 So I said, yes, sir.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000 And he got in the truck with the guys, right?
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000 And I started moving these blocks.
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000 I was running.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000 I was running.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000 Literally running as fast as I could possibly do it.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000 And I wasn't even doing that as like a challenge to myself.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000 I was so happy to not be working at Wendy's.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000 Yeah.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000 That I would have, I mean, I just was filled with energy.
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000 So I can get all these blocks done.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000 And another guy was there who didn't go to get coffee donuts.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And he kind of gave me, hey, man, you need to slow down.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000 Yeah.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000 You know, you're going to make him look bad.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000 And I would just say, hey, I'm going pretty slow.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000 And I said, I said, I'll do whatever.
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000 You know, I'll do your job.
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000 You can sit there.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 I don't care.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000 So, but what do you think of any of that?
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000 You didn't get any, I mean, you didn't pose little challenges to yourself.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000 Yeah.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.000 You're a little work crew.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000 That's actually how I got by.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000 I was like, okay, let me do this.
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000 Because if there's a way to get by, you should tell people because some people are stuck in jobs
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000 They don't like right at this moment in time.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000 They're listening to podcasts and they're working at Wendy's.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000 Yeah.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000 And I work at Wendy's.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000 Bro.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000 Yeah.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000 That was a lot of fun.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000 That was a fun locker.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000 That was a fun locker.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000 That was a fun.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000 Worked at full luck.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000 But what is like that?
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000 What is that?
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000 What is that?
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000 What is that?
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000 Like that?
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000 Yeah.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 He knows funny men.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000 On quiet working at full luck was kind of, when you walk in, it'd be like,
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Hey, that's kind of cool.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000 You get to wear the ref uniform and all that.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000 And the men, when we, we're in high school.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000 Yeah.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000 So, man, we start working.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000 I was like, this is, it's tedious.
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000 It's weird how your perspective changes.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Yeah.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000 I was thinking about that the other day when you're a young team guy.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000 And you get like when I got my first apartment.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000 I was, I'm a little man.
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000 Yeah.
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000 I was the richest guy in the world.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000 Yeah.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000 Yeah.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000 I was the man.
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000 Yeah.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000 But then as you, you know, you settle into that.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000 And then you say, well, you know what I need to buy.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000 Cool.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000 That little house.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000 I like you got to be, be wary of the greed.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000 That's true.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000 That's true.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000 But that's natural though, right?
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000 It's like, you don't when you get used to something.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000 It becomes the new standard.
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000 You know how that whole thing works.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000 Right.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000 Well, okay.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000 Then what's the difference between someone?
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000 Because you and I both know people.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000 There's people that get to the comfort zone and then they're done.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000 What's the difference between someone that gets the comfort zone and done?
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000 And someone that gets the comfort zone and says, alright, I'm comfortable here, but I want more.
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000 Yeah.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.000 Yeah.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000 I want to do more.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000 Maybe not want more because that implies a materialistic point.
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000 But I just want more.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000 Huh.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000 Yeah.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.000 I know.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000 Because they're both like really like obviously prevalent in like almost natural.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.000 Yeah.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000 You can get both those personalities exist.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 Yeah.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000 But I'm sure we're all like, but we're both of that.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000 I'm sure everybody is both of those things in one way or another.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000 You know, like in, you know, like we're probably both in like the comfort zone big time as far as certain things.
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000 You know, I don't know why the whole thing.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000 You know, I can't.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000 No, you know what's interesting.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000 Yeah.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000 Because if you think about it, you see someone that's got 70% body fat.
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000 Yeah.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000 And you go dude.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000 Yeah.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000 That dude's got 70% body fat.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000 That's got like that sucks.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000 Like, yeah.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000 That person should work.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000 You know, trying to get that, trying to drop that percentage down.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000 Yeah.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000 But there's someone that's looking at me.
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000 Some guy that's obsessed with being lean as hell.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000 He's looking at me like God.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000 I can't believe chocolate's got whatever.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000 Yeah.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000 20% or 18.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000 Whatever my percent body fat is.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000 Yeah.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000 He's looking at me going.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000 Dude.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000 Well, you know, I mean, so why am I comfort zone?
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000 No, no, no, no, no.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000 I don't know.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000 No, no, no.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000 Because it's not like you were getting after it.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000 You're not after your body percent levels.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000 And then you had a certain number and then you were like,
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000 I don't care.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000 It's kind of thing.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000 I don't think that that's a good way it went.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000 Here's what have and not with you.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000 Obviously, I can't speak as far as your comfort zones go.
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000 But a typical one we'll say is that, you know,
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000 guys will be working out and like getting their fresh hair cut or whatever.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000 And then they'll get married and then they won't work out as much.
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000 You guys girls whatever.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000 You know, and do that, they quote unquote let themselves go after they get married.
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000 Like that kind of stuff.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000 But they might focus a lot more on their career.
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000 And then they might want more of that.
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000 But then, you know, it's like that kind of stuff.
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000 Yeah.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000 I think you gotta watch out for the comfort zone.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000 Yeah, I need to go to.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000 All right.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000 Next.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 Oh, now we've moved beyond those opening lines.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000 And now we get into the bulk of the book book,
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000 which again, which is written by this book again, guy.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000 And here we go.
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000 It does not matter whether you are filing firing at an enemy near you or an opponent.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000 Some distance away, you should be a depth that's selecting the best arrowhead.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000 And then the, the amplification on that says the lesson here is that you need a strong arrow for an adversary at close range.
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000 But a lighter one for hitting an opponent far away.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000 And I guess when I read this, the point that I got out of it was,
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000 you, you need to be able to select your tools properly.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000 Right.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000 And as a leader, you need to be able to select.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000 Think of all the tools we've talked about on this podcast that you need to use as a leader.
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000 Yeah.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000 Some guys gotta be a little bit harsher with a guy.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000 Sometimes you gotta be, you gotta flank a guy.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000 Sometimes you gotta be directors.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000 All these different tools that you need to use as a leader.
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000 You gotta be a depth that's selecting the right tools.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000 And I gave a metaphor on here one time about about
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000 how, uh, you're like a woodworker, right?
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000 This is actually what's interesting about the woodworker metaphor is as a leader.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000 You have to be like a woodworker, which means you need to learn all these different types of tools.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000 But you need to learn how to use these different tools on different types of wood.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000 And each one of these types of wood, each one of these individual pieces of wood is a little bit different.
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 They got a little not, they got a grain, they get things.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000 So you, you can't just learn a mechanical skill.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000 Yeah.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000 You have to learn to be a true craftsman with the tools.
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000 And then you have to learn about what the different types of people they are.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000 And then you have to see that each, even a different type, like this person might have a big ego.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000 But they got this other thing.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000 You know, they get a little different grain.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000 Yeah.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000 Kind of like a barber.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000 You know, the barber cuts your hair.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000 You're the person using the clippers.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000 Well, yeah.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000 And you keep us up the thing and it depends, you know.
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Yeah.
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000 That's true.
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000 Like a barber or I guess we could say any type of craftsmen that is to work with varying medium.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 Sure.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000 Yeah, pretty much anybody really.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000 Everybody.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000 Everybody.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000 You've watched the social network, right?
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000 Watch that show.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000 Sounds weird.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000 It's a, when you first hear the idea of Facebook, you both have about Facebook and Zuckerberg.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000 The first, when you hear about that, you're like, oh, who cares?
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000 But probably that's a good movie.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000 Really good movie.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000 Anyway.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000 It's a movie.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000 I thought it was a show movie.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000 A movie.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000 Okay.
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000 The social network.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000 Is he awkward?
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000 Yeah.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000 Yeah.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000 It's really, they overdo his awkwardness.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000 Maybe.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000 I don't know.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000 I don't really follow Zuckerberg to know his awkwardness or whatever.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000 But he ever heard people call him sucks.
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000 Yeah, sucks.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000 Like that.
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000 We can tell you the coffee sucks.
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000 We're tied.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000 Anyway.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000 Yeah.
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000 Sure.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000 But he's doing something.
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000 He's breaking into the college computer or mainframe.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Whatever.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000 He's breaking into and he's kind of narrating what he's doing.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000 He's like, I had to do this.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000 So I break out this.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000 You know, and he's doing the same thing.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000 That was a really revealing part in regards to his kind of thing.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000 Oh, he's got to make sure he's getting here because he's trying to solve these
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 for it.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000 It's all code and you know, so he's trying to solve this problem.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000 But then this problem comes out.
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000 And then this one has these specific problems.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000 So he has to solve them.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000 But he can't just deal with the current tools.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000 He has to bust out together.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000 The vision when he was creating it of of what it was going to be.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000 Well, did he feel that confident about it?
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000 Did he see the whole vision or did he like wake up one day and say,
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000 Dang, this thing is going to be really long.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000 No, no.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000 It was like it was a slow evolution into it because at first it was like he started with this thing called
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000 Face Smash, which was basically just comparing the girls on campus like who's hotter.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000 And then you click, okay, she's hotter.
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000 Then he go to the next one.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000 She's hotter.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000 You know, and that's called buttocks.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000 Yes.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000 And that was a big part of it.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000 It was like that's what people would hate them and stuff like that.
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000 And then it just slowly, um, now it was a social network.
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000 These guys.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000 Like, we were like, what a teenager would do, right?
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000 Oh, yeah, big time.
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000 And that's what they were trying to emphasize to more like he just wanted to be liked by people.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000 He made that.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000 I'm like, I thought that was going to help him be liked.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000 He didn't do your job.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000 He's not.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000 This is just what the moves that I don't know.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000 You know, I'm sure there's some inconsistencies with it.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000 But no, it's weird is it would be weird to meet him.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000 We're not just to meet him like, hey, nice to meet you, but to actually know him.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000 I guess.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000 Because then you see what someone's there's been there's been people that I've kind of known that we're
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000 uh, whatever, so to say, my famous or whatever the word is.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000 Sure.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000 And in reality, like on TV, they seem like they're not cool people.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000 But in regular life, they're really cool.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000 And then the opposite, I've also seen where someone is,
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000 It seems super cool.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000 When you see their persona and then real life, they're not cool.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000 Yeah.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000 Yeah.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000 I guess that'd be pretty common to kind of be inconsistent that way.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000 Or have it be inconsistent as far as your experience with that person.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000 Seems like they had to be kind of common.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Right?
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000 Because a lot of people, if they're famous or if they're, you know,
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000 famous, pop it whatever.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000 A lot of times you kind of got to turn it on for the camera, right?
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000 Especially because you're essentially a performer in one way or another,
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000 whether it be actor or whoever, you know,
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000 even like businessmen, you know, like it's weird.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000 And it's not even necessarily a bad thing.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000 It's more like for lack of a better term, a required thing.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000 You know, so like my brother, for example, like if I know him,
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000 but then when I hear him talking to like,
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000 I don't know exactly.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000 Or like everyone's while he'll, I'll see him on like an interview or something.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000 And I'm like, like, he, there's only because I know.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000 I know.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000 So good.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000 So like I feel like just a lot of, uh, Joe Rogan.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 So I actually met Joe Rogan.
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000 A long time ago when I was just Dean's one of Dean's
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000 cornermen, right? You know how Joe Rogan treated me back then?
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000 Oh, super cool.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000 Like just like just the same.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000 I then when I was up on his podcast,
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000 the same dude.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000 That's a good dude right there.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000 You know what I mean?
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000 A green and strangely enough, I had the exact same experience.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000 And this is, and this whole, this whole kind of demonstrate how legit
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000 a minute it is, right?
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000 So same exact story.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000 I messed Joe Rogan for the first time with Dean and my wife.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000 We went to, we kind of knew Red Banner.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000 So we went to one of his shows.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000 We got to go to one of his shows and go talk to him afterwards, right?
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000 So that's the first day of Madame.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000 Same thing.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000 Super nice.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000 Game is email.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.000 Yeah.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000 I'm like, sorry.
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000 I'm just some dude.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000 He was like, yeah.
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000 Email this guy.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000 Yeah.
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000 And then so the next time I see him was when I went to
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000 Legends to train.
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000 When I was going to LA for, you know,
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000 I'd be performing.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000 Then train at Legends.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000 And so I go there and, um,
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000 he's there.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000 He's rolling with everyone and everything.
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000 You know, it's like he's known there or whatever.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000 You know, like, come, just another person there.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000 It's for his training us.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000 And then, um, so he's kind of cruising down the side.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000 So I'm going to go last something to roll.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000 So I was like, hey, what's up.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000 Yeah, I met you with Dean long time ago.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000 You know, a few years ago, whatever.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000 It's like he was like, yeah,
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000 I must have been a lot like he totally did it.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000 Remember me, you know.
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000 It's not like, I remember you.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000 So now I'm going to be cool to you.
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000 It was like he did totally did it.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000 Remember me.
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I was probably one of many people.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000 And he was still just his cool.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000 So he starts talking about you.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000 You know how like you did.
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000 You know, hey, small talk before you guys roll.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000 And then, um, so it's small talking.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000 He starts talking about current USC stuff.
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000 We didn't even roll.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000 I just want to listen to him talk about USC.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000 And so he did roll.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000 But same thing, same exact thing.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000 And then, and even when I went up to film with him for the
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000 Metamorphor stuff for Eddie Bravista, same thing.
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000 He liked for God and brought me again.
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000 That was like years ago.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000 And he was like, oh, yeah, that must have been a long time ago.
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000 Same exact thing.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000 I was like, yeah, I actually respect the fact that this go, oh, yeah,
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000 yeah, I remember.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000 Yeah, yeah, fully.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000 Yeah, he's, he doesn't play that game.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Yeah, and I actually met 80 million people last year.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000 And I don't really remember you, but it's good to hang out with you right now again.
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000 Yeah, exactly exactly exactly.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000 And this, I mean, of course, yeah, Joe Rogan is like this.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000 And if people are like this in general, that is just like I said,
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000 that's kind of like a, not a late missed test, but kind of like,
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000 it's this indicator, you know, he didn't remember me.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000 So really, since he didn't remember me,
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000 for all intents purposes, I was just another person.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000 And same exact treatment, just cool, just normal.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 Oh, yeah.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000 It wasn't like, I mean, you're you, and there's this separation kind of thing.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 It would none of that.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000 Yeah, no.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000 It's good way to be.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.000 Yeah.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 I don't know how we ended up talking about that one.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000 You dropped Joe Rogan's name and we said, it's not going to be that.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000 So, you know.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000 Good point, name job.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000 name job.
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000 All right.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000 Next, your mount should be of normal strength and spirit.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000 Horses with a strong urge to win or fearful and skiddish
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000 should be rejected out of hand.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000 So I thought this was interesting.
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000 Because we're talking about finding someone that's balanced, right?
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000 Not someone that's, he's a normal, normal strength and spirit.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000 Don't want someone that's, brah, grow.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000 But you don't want someone that's weak.
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000 You want someone that's in the middle.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000 And the, the amplification on it says horses without nerve or weak while a horse with a lot of spirit
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000 cannot be written by normal people.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000 Hmm.
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.000 In other words, a slightly strong somewhat plucky horse is best, plucky, by the way.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000 Second time we've heard that word today.
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000 Hmm.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000 This is a sign to learn the word.
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000 Do you know what it means?
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000 I didn't know it.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000 No, no.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 Plucky means brave.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000 Okay, doesn't need.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000 How to look that one up.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000 Similar here as long as a horse is strong is acceptable.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000 It is acceptable for it to have a certain inclination.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000 However, never ride a horse with a tendency to retreat.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000 So if you got a strong horse, it's, it's basically to me.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000 This is as long as the thing is not going to turn tail.
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000 If it's a little bit feisty, if it's a little bit less a little bit of that,
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000 you can have a little bit different person.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000 And what I took away from this is as a leader once again,
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000 you're going to get people with some things going on.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000 Some little personality traits, some little, like when you're putting together a seal
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000 puttune, you're going to have some guys that are, got some 80 or same creases, right?
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000 Yeah.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000 You got 16 guys in a seal puttune.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000 You got 36 guys in a task unit that they're not all the same by any stretch.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000 And some of them are going to be even further outside the box of, you know,
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000 they're going to have some kind of, the 80 or same creases.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000 You might even call it an issue.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000 I think that's kind of an overused word, but it might have some kind of issue, right?
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000 Sure.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000 Okay.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000 What this is saying is, as long as they're not going to retreat and run,
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000 we're all right.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000 But if they're going to retreat and run, if that's their, are you a sink or sink?
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000 Yeah.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000 Get rid of them.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000 What do you call it?
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000 Deal breaker.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000 Deal breaker.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000 Deal breaker big time.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000 All right.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000 Next, while small horses may be easier to handle as well as dismount from those
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000 who prefer such animals are a bit demwitted.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000 So what I like about this is, if you're in a leadership position,
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000 you might want to surround yourself with people that are just,
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000 that are just dudes you say in there.
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000 You're going to say it.
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.000 Yeah.
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000 I want my horses all just to fall in line and they're easy to get on and off.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000 And if I yell at them, they don't bark back.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000 Yeah.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000 You don't want those people.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000 You want people that are a little bit harder to handle.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 Just a little bit harder to handle.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000 Maybe they're going to stand up to you. Like I always say, you don't want to be surrounded by yes men.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000 You want to be surrounded by people that will question you, it's a, I don't like this plan.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000 So that's kind of horses you want.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000 Not, not little tiny weak horses.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000 No.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000 All right.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000 Next.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000 You should know that a person wearing a newly forged sword will invariably
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000 blunder even if that sword cuts well.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000 So basically, this is like you got to watch a new guy's a little bit.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000 Wait.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.000 Wait.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000 Say that again.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000 It's, it's, it's, you should know that a person wearing a newly forged sword will invariably
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000 blunder even if that sword cuts well.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000 Okay.
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000 That's it.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000 So you got to watch a new guy's in.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000 Here's the amplification on this one.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000 A sword that is not at least a hundred years old is one that you cannot rely on.
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000 Good. Okay.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.000 Yeah.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000 It's like young people full of vigor and energy.
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000 The vitality of a young sword is not entirely stable.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000 You cannot rely on it.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000 Hey, you got to watch.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000 Yeah.
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000 You got to watch.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000 Unproven, unproven.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000 Got to watch him.
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000 That makes sense to me.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000 And I'm not saying they won't be bad asses.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.000 Yeah.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000 Because it might be.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.000 Right.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000 They might be.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000 I had new guys that were built complete bad asses.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000 But you don't know that.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000 I also had new guys where you'd think they're going to be good.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000 It's weird man.
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000 I've been talking about buds a little bit lately.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Sure.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000 Some of my friends.
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000 You, you have no idea who's going to make it through.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000 Yeah.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000 You don't know because it's mental right?
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000 You're, it's mental and physical.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000 You can't see.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.000 You can't see.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000 You can't see.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000 You can't see.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000 You can't see.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000 You can't see.
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000 You can't see.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000 You can't see.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000 You can't see.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000 You can't see.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 Is there like, I don't know.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000 But you know, like, let's say there's a run.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000 And you got to, you know, do they, is there any circumstances that are this or similar to this?
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000 Where you got to make this run in, you know, ten minutes, whatever.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000 And if you don't make the ten minutes, you're out.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000 Yeah.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000 But there's stuff like that.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000 For sure.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Absolutely.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000 There's actually the standard times where runs have been in place since I went through
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000 and they're the same for the food.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000 What they call a four mile time run.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000 Yeah.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000 And in first phase, the time maximum time you can take is 32 minutes.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000 32 minutes.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 What are you running?
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000 That's, that's, that's your, your surprise because that's slow, right?
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000 Four mile.
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000 That's a time run.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000 That's eight minute mile.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000 That's pretty fast.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000 What?
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000 It's pretty fast.
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000 No.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000 It's pretty fast.
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000 Then in second phase, it goes down to 30 minutes.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000 Bro, you used to run a what?
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000 Oh, yeah.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000 I could do it.
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000 But it's not like that.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000 Yeah.
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000 Let me tell you.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000 Let me tell you.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000 That's not fast.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000 In second phase, it goes to 30 minutes.
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000 In fourth phase, it goes to 28 minutes.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000 That's a seven minute mile.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000 That is not fast.
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000 Yeah.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000 I thought you're going to say like 10 minute mile.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000 This is what, this is what trips people up or jams people up as you like to say.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000 What jams people up is when you do the run, you're not fresh.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000 That's the thing.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000 You're not fresh.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000 You're not fresh.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000 You're not fresh.
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000 You're wearing boots, boots, your pants.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000 You're on the soft sand.
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000 On the sand.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000 Yeah.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.000 Yeah.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000 And the sand like part of it will be hard pack.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000 Yeah.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000 But then like part of it's going to be soft.
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000 Yeah.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000 And this has changed a little bit from what I've been told.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000 When I went through the instructors, maybe that run was 4.2 miles.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000 Yeah.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000 4.5 miles.
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000 Maybe it was 3.8 miles.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000 They kind of estimated.
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000 So if you didn't make it the time.
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000 So when I went through, if you didn't make the time for that at for run,
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000 they had your name if you failed to get and you were done.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000 Okay.
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000 So it's like one strike.
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000 Yes.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.000 Okay.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000 Now the interesting thing is if you failed to run and then you failed to swim,
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000 you could still,
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000 will you still be there?
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000 But if you failed to run,
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000 or again, you can.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000 Yeah.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000 If you failed to run and to swim and you failed on obstacle course,
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000 you'd still be there.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.000 Okay.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000 I failed one more time.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000 They call it being on the bubble.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.000 Yeah.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000 Actually, I think that actually came from Officer Canada School.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000 I don't think we said the bubble.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000 There's new things that that that developed.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000 That develop in Buds.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000 Yeah.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000 Take that come.
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000 Yeah.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000 I've heard on the bubble plenty times.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000 You're on the bubble.
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000 They should have tried.
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000 That just means in general.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000 In life.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000 Yeah.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000 Like for your college job.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000 Yeah.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.000 You're in a bubble.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000 You can cut.
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000 Yeah.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000 So.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000 Thanks.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.000 Okay.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000 So that's what you mean by it's physicals.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000 Yeah.
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000 It's physical.
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000 If you don't.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.000 Yeah.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000 You can fail physically.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000 I've been telling people this lately.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000 I had to run as fast as I could possibly run the past the runs.
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000 For that formula,
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000 that would be me too.
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000 And the one time one time I paste myself.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000 It was like, you know what?
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000 I'm just going to paste myself.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000 I'm sure I'll be fine.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000 I paste myself.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.000 Yeah.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000 I failed.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000 Like.
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000 So then from then on.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000 And I had a buddy that was a cross country runner.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.000 Yeah.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000 And I school or college or something.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000 Mm-hmm.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000 And he's a hate run with me.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000 And I'm like, yeah.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000 And I didn't.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Like I'd brand his heart as a.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000 And that's how I had to run every run.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000 I had to run this hard as I could.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000 Yeah.
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000 And there's guys that ran cross country.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000 Those runs are joke for those guys.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000 I mean, yeah.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000 Echo.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000 I mean, there's a lot of people that can run five minute miles.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000 Yeah.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000 That are doing those runs.
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000 And, you know, a formal run in like 20 to 22 minutes.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000 Yeah.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000 And that's not true.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000 I'm surprised that you thought that was fast.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000 I think I just caught you off guard.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 You know, it's slow dude.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000 It might be slow.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000 Do you mean the way me my fast and depends on when you meet my slow.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000 When I used to like run,
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000 I would run on the treadmill and I would run a seven minute.
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000 And I'm talking to me like the treadmill.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000 But those are, no.
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000 That's part of my life.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000 No, that's part of my point.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000 You run on the treadmill.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000 I'd run like a seven minute mile pace.
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000 And I'd be like dang.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000 And, but I don't only do like one mile.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Gonna be like good.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000 That's like, I've, I've only run on a treadmill like three times.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000 It's easier.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.000 It's easier.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000 Yeah.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000 You're like, if I was on board ships,
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000 I would run around the flight deck.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000 Yeah.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000 So that's what I mean.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000 I'm talking to you.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000 These guys running seven, eight minute mile.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000 Usually when I'd run like four miles or five miles on the treadmill,
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000 it'd be like ten, like just under like nine minutes.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000 Something like that.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000 I don't even know how to translate to your treadmill.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000 I honestly don't.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000 I don't know how that translates.
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000 Yeah.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000 So I would say it's like, but a nine minute mile is pathetic.
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000 Right.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000 That's, and that's what the pace older run my four miles.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000 And I wouldn't be dead, but I'd be that beat.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000 Yes.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000 There's a harder.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000 If I, if you want me to run an eight minute, seven minute, eight minute mile with boots
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000 in the sand even some of the time you're crazy.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000 I would be.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000 So you're a little bit of a distance runner is what I'm hearing.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000 Apparently, yeah.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000 I would be going like you as fast as I possibly can to make it.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000 Check.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000 Dang.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000 Back to the book.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Well, you should select a sword with a handle that is long and thin.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000 You should reject any sword with one that is excessively long.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000 I like that a lot of these rules are balanced.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000 They're about balance.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000 That's what they're about.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000 Hey, you want it long and thin, but don't.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000 Yeah.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000 You want to horse that's strong, but not overly strong.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000 Yeah.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000 This is a lot about balance.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000 And here's the amplification.
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000 You are less likely to drop a sword with a thin handle.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000 However, in cold weather, you are liable to drop a sword with a thick handle.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000 For the most part, when on horseback, you should pass a string through the hand guard of your sword and tie it to your arm.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000 Once you drop it, you will to pick it up again.
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000 Have landed.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000 Have a landed on your weapon.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000 Have a leash.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000 Have a board?
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000 No.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000 That's different.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000 No, no, no, no, no.
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000 I think that's the same thing.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000 No, no, no.
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000 These are for dogs.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000 Don't.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000 I had my whole career.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000 Had a landed on my pistol.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000 Only needed it one time.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000 Dang.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000 I don't think I even heard of it.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000 Meaning, me and I only dropped my pistol one time.
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000 Yeah.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000 Yeah.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000 Next.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000 Again, balance.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000 It is good for the tip of your spear to be long.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.000 However, if it is too long, you may find yourself in trouble.
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000 Amplification, the blade on the end of your spear should be long, but not excessively so.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000 If it is too heavy, then you'll lose it.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000 Balance.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000 Gotta keep things balanced.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000 Next, even if you are able to fly up into the sky without feathers, you have no chance of victory with a spear.
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000 You cannot wield with your own two hands.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000 I like that one.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000 Is that kind of like girls overpacking for a trip and making you carry their stuff?
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000 I don't think it has anything to do with that.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000 Kind of.
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000 When you really think about it, think about it.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000 Oh, because she can't carry her stuff.
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000 Yes, she has all her stuff that she needs, and she's going to do well on the vacation as far as comfort goes whatever.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000 But she can't even carry it.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000 If you would have made it not about vacation, but about patrolling on the woods, right?
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000 It's great that you brought a whisper light and extra food and all this other stuff.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000 But you can't carry it.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000 Yeah.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000 Remember Lafay was talking about that?
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000 Yeah.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000 First patrol, the body.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000 You had 27 and grand grandads with them.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000 You used ready for World War III though.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000 You know.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:15.000 Yeah, because it was the double doozy was getting acclimated to being in the 120 degree heat and getting acclimated to running around the Marine Corps is out.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:24.000 They've been out there for months sprinting from corner to corner to cover cover and they've already minimized their gear somewhat.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000 And Lafay shows up.
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000 He's not only easy, a little heavy or maybe even a lot heavy.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000 But also he's getting acclimated.
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000 So it's a double.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000 It's a one-two punch.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000 Yep.
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000 All right.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000 This is a good one.
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000 While the shaft of your spear should be long ignored the ground at your peril.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000 When I first read that, I was like, myself, okay, what does that mean?
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000 Let me ignore the ground.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000 Here's the amplification.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000 The length of short to see your spear as well as the weight lighter heavier should differ based on three factors.
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000 You, your enemy and the battleground.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.000 So even if your spear is sufficient, not having an understanding of the terrain will result in defeat.
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000 terrain.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000 That's what that means by ground.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000 Yeah.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000 Ignore the ground at your peril.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000 And this is something that's very difficult.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000 It's something that we don't talk about even even I've talked about it before on this podcast.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000 Mm-hmm.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000 Knowing terrain.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000 That's what combat is.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000 Combat is knowing and understanding the terrain.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000 It's knowing and understanding the ground.
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000 It's understanding land features and buildings and what angles producing and where your patrol should go and where a good ambush site would be.
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000 That is all based on knowing the ground.
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000 The terrain is what we call, we don't call the ground.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000 We call it the terrain.
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000 Yeah.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000 Knowing terrain features.
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000 Micro features.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000 Micro terrain.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000 What's this little draw?
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000 Dead space.
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000 All these little things are so important.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:06.000 So that rule absolutely applies to this day.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000 Next.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000 Samurai do not gorge themselves at bankwits.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000 Eating twice a day is more than enough.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000 An amplification.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000 Samurai must train themselves to be able to withstand hunger and to always be on their guard.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000 So today's past it was said that two meals a day is plenty.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000 It appears there were some people eating three times a day in this era.
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000 Dropping the hammer.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000 Do you eat three meals a day?
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000 Three.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000 Yeah.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000 That's how.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000 Sometimes two.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000 What I'm feeling, you know, more your spirit.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Yeah.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000 I've actually heard that.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000 I think hoiler was the one who told me that two meals a day.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000 No, it wasn't as much as it was the amount of meals a day.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000 It was like the type of meals.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000 You know, they would eat that meat.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000 They have a certain mix of kind of formula.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000 But they see diet.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000 Yeah.
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000 And if you notice it, it's really light.
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000 But nanos you know.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000 You come first.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000 Yeah.
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000 Yeah.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000 It's weird stuff that you're going to miss.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:10.000 Yeah.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000 But we made this smoothie for one time.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000 It was like, there was like, I want to say cream cheese in there with water
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000 Mellon and but it was like interesting little mix.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000 But it was good though.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000 But it was like, it's like a lot of stuff is like, because you, um, you know, when you get a lot of people coming in trying to challenge you at the academy.
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000 It's like, oh, it's going, you know, when people, you've got to be ready.
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000 You've got to be ready.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000 Yeah.
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000 So you can't be like, oh, I just ate up, you know, I don't know.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000 I don't like drinking.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000 People ask me that all the time.
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000 Do you, do you, do you, what are you eating the morning before you work out?
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000 I don't know anything.
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000 Nothing.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:39.000 Yes.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000 And I don't like to eat before I train.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000 Oh, great.
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000 And some people say, oh, it's an hour and a half.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000 But now I'm going to have to for a train. I don't even like to eat two, three hours before I try to.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000 I mean, that's why it's much, but chicken today.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000 You got the laid.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000 And I was like, hey, if I don't eat now, you might get angry.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000 No, then by the time I'm training tonight,
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000 No, yeah, I didn't.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000 Then I would have to eat when we were done.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000 And then all the sudden it's, yeah, 45 minutes to an hour and I'm on the mat.
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000 And I don't like that feeling.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000 Oh, it's starting to my gut.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000 Yeah, I rather not eat.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000 We'll consider this where in a real general way.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000 I've explained it in it.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000 If you, you know, when you eat something, your stomach got to work.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000 You're something muscle.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000 Yeah, it's smooth muscles.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000 Yeah.
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000 That's a little still.
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000 Scallot muscles.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000 By the way, smooth muscles.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000 They got to get to work.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000 I mean, you know, and enzymes go in there.
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000 All this stuff.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000 So that's taken away from your.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000 Yeah, the blood flow like all this.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000 Basically, the resources of your body start going to your stomach.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000 Now, and now you want to demand some resources for the rest of your body.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000 Well, when you go to train, the stomach's like, hey, what about us?
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000 Resources bail from the stomach a little bit.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000 Stomph feels upset.
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000 You might throw up.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000 Mm-hmm.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000 We're feel like it.
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000 And you almost puked the other day.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000 Yeah, that's bad.
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000 All right.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000 Same subject.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000 That's why I'm going to go right to it.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000 If a samurai is preparing to step onto the field of battle, does why do avoid?
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000 Is wise to avoid eating anything other than hot water poured over rice?
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000 So that's one way to do it.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000 Keep the amplification.
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000 If you eat a lot at a banquet before a great battle, the food will not have settled
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000 by the time the fighting starts echo Charles called it.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000 Yeah.
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000 If you then were to have your head chopped off, all that food would come out and it would
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000 make a great big mess.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000 Food will not pass down the throne of a coward.
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000 It appears to you is not common.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000 Okay.
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000 Next one.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000 Something a samurai should never be without is the thing you use to sharpen your blade.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000 A wet stone.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000 Makes sense, right?
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000 Yeah.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000 That's why you bring your rings when you go on your own.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000 Your neck going on travel.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000 Yeah.
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000 If I go for multiple days.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000 If I go, if I'm only going to be gone for like two or three days, I will just use whatever
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000 random pull up bar I can find or make or yeah.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000 But if I'm going for five days, six days, bring the rings.
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000 Yeah.
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000 That rings make a big difference if you have rings.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000 Yeah.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000 So many workouts you can do with just rings.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000 Yeah.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000 When you think about it and I know this from experience, it's in my experience.
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000 It's harder to find something to do pull ups on than what you'd expect.
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000 Do you think, oh yeah, I can just do it like right here.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000 Wherever.
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000 But it can be harder.
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000 Yeah.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000 You can do push ups anywhere.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000 You can do inkline push ups.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000 You go against the on needle.
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000 I'll do inkline push ups.
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000 And you can also use.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000 It's crazy squats and crystals and jump squats.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000 Yeah.
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000 Burpees.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000 Yeah.
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000 Pollups.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000 That's why rings are key.
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000 And once you have rings, then you can also do ring dips.
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000 You can do like assisted squats if you need them.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000 I don't want to do that, but.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000 Oh, no.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000 You don't need them.
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000 No, no.
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000 Well, I think these blocks.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000 You're the man.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000 Bro, I'm not over here bragging about being able to do empty body weight squats.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000 But.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000 But you can do everything once you have pararigs.
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000 And you can usually find a place to do pull ups somewhere.
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000 Parking rush.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000 They have little overhanging ledges.
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000 They have eye beams.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000 You can hang on to.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000 They have eye dysaches.
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000 I know someone's going to rip it and break it and spray water.
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000 Every over the half sprinkler system.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000 Yeah.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000 And that's actually plumbing.
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000 Plumming is part of my point.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000 Actually, the cast iron where they where the sewage goes out of a building.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000 It's usually a big pipe.
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000 And it's hard to do purpose.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000 But it's good.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000 Yeah.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000 I don't think that that's.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000 I think that's a risk right there.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000 And it's probably against some sort of a blue hole at the hotel.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000 Yeah.
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000 You're so kind of careful.
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000 Don't tell him.
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000 I told you.
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000 Yeah.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000 Bring the blame me.
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000 Break through.
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000 And then we'll work.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000 I'm going to get your your faults.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000 Next.
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000 It is unseen me for a samurai to be enamored with the flavor of food that is set down before them.
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000 It's best that your meal be a soup made of boiled water poured over rice.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000 That's how they roll.
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000 Yeah.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000 They're just like, you know what I'm going to eat?
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000 Yeah.
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000 With hot water poured over it.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000 Yeah.
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000 Otherwise, the distraction.
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000 Do you think that that.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000 That sort of a set of system keeps keeps you tougher.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000 Kind of.
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000 Yeah.
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000 In a way.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000 It provides less distraction from your goal.
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000 Because I can in fitness and you know, like working out.
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000 Body building.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000 A lot of time.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000 Like that's a factor big time.
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000 Because you got to eat a certain amount to maintain or gain weight and all this stuff.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000 And, you know, maintain certain, you know, back rows.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000 You know, fat levels all this stuff.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000 So you can't just be going to KFC and wherever you think is super delicious.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000 And just eating and being like, hey, this, you got to have like certain amount of like lean stuff.
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000 And you can't add a bunch of sauces because there's extra calories in there.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000 You know, all this stuff.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000 So yeah, if you, if you can endure that kind of kind of like food that doesn't necessarily taste that good.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000 Yeah, you can get to your goal way better.
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000 What about Charlie Plum, me eating two balls of rice a day for six years?
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000 Yeah.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000 I'm sure that, you know, that kind of helped them help the later.
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000 What?
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000 It's like accepting of conditions.
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000 Okay.
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000 Well, that, yeah.
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000 You know, like you, it's like if you're, if you're used to sleeping on the floor with like no AC and then you get whatever.
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000 Yeah, you know, you can go sleep on someone's couch.
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000 You can go get rest pretty much anywhere.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000 And that's a good luxury.
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000 If you, especially when you compare it to a situation where you don't, you don't have that kind of tolerance, you know.
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000 You know, the kind of where you, like you need a certain like softness and temperature and
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000 noise level to sleep, there's people fall asleep.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000 Yeah.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000 And then some people, they'll just fall right.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.000 Yeah.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000 While you're talking to them if they want to kind of think.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000 Yeah.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000 I can see, I can see, I can see, really, he's on airplanes.
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000 Yeah.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000 Me too.
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000 I get a little crouched up and a little ball.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000 And then he's going to sleep.
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000 You know what, here's what he actually says.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000 Here's the amplifying information.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000 The profession of the samurai involves being an extreme environment.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000 Therefore, gourmet food is of no benefit to them.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000 There you go.
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:05.000 Do you think that people that just eat really, really high in food all the time, when they go back to eating normal food?
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000 Is it, like, are they suffering?
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000 Yeah, probably a little bit.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000 Yeah.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000 In one way.
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000 You depends how they regard it, you know?
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000 Because you know, it's funny when I was a kid, we, like, I eat a lot of steak now.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000 Sure.
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000 When I was a kid, we didn't even need steak.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000 Steak costs a lot of money. It does. And when I was a kid, we hamburgers.
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000 Sure.
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000 Yeah.
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000 A lot of hamburgers.
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000 Yeah, that is what.
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:31.000 Yeah.
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000 I didn't even like steak when I got in the Navy, I didn't like steak.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000 Huh.
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000 Then like it, I had to, I didn't, I just wasn't used to it.
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000 Yeah.
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000 It took me a couple years before I started liking steak.
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000 Yeah.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000 Usually you hit that one steak that's, like, prepared perfectly.
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000 And then in your mind, you're like, dang, I love steak now.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000 And then even if you get another steak that wasn't prepared that perfectly,
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000 I don't even know if you're, I don't know if you're assuming it happened to me.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:55.000 Yeah.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000 Don't even know if you're just like a, I remember eating burgers at Wendy's though.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000 Yeah.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000 Yeah.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.000 Yeah.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.000 Yeah.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:01.000 Yeah.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000 All right.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000 Next.
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000 When entering a confrontation, Samurai should need to look back on the path traveled.
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000 Nor what is off to left to right.
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000 So to me that says,
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000 I would prioritize next to you, right?
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000 No, we're looking around.
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000 You see what you see, what you got to, you see what you got to do.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000 You got to confrontation front of you.
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000 Here's the implication from the onset.
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000 You should place your, place your full concentration on the battle and not allow your focus to laps during the course of the battle.
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000 The most important aspects of the battle, the most important aspects of battle are the use of people and the use of natural geography.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000 Right?
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000 You're a leader. You got to use your people correctly.
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000 And as I just talked about terrain using the natural geography, those are the two most important things.
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000 Now can you get target fixation?
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000 Yes, you can.
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000 So you can get so focused that if you don't pay attention, what's going on left and right, you might get flicked.
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000 Yeah.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000 So you got to watch out for that one.
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000 Next.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.96 Samurai should mind neither the heat of summer nor the cold of winter as they race through fields and over
01:13:12.96 --> 01:13:14.96 mountains, exhausting their bodies.
01:13:14.96 --> 01:13:15.96 Boom.
01:13:15.96 --> 01:13:17.96 You got to train a heat and cold.
01:13:17.96 --> 01:13:18.96 Yeah.
01:13:18.96 --> 01:13:20.96 That's welcome to the military.
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:23.96 You freeze and you sweat.
01:13:23.96 --> 01:13:25.96 That's the way it works.
01:13:25.96 --> 01:13:26.96 Yeah.
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:33.96 Funny, Tonya Fraddy and you kind of turned me on to just mentally.
01:13:33.96 --> 01:13:38.96 It's more like putting your mind at a certain, in a certain way where, sure it'll be cold,
01:13:38.96 --> 01:13:41.96 but it's not about how cold or not cold it is.
01:13:41.96 --> 01:13:42.96 Sure it'll be hot.
01:13:42.96 --> 01:13:46.96 It's not about how hot or not hot it is and you can't complain about that stuff.
01:13:46.96 --> 01:13:51.96 And if you complain, that's like, that's the part that's going to jam you up.
01:13:51.96 --> 01:13:52.96 Just how you regard it.
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:53.96 Yeah.
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:55.96 You could not complain in the deems.
01:13:55.96 --> 01:13:56.96 Here's what's funny.
01:13:56.96 --> 01:13:57.96 Here's what's funny.
01:13:57.96 --> 01:14:00.96 I just, you can experience this really easily.
01:14:00.96 --> 01:14:08.96 Let's say you and me are out at the beach and it's warm, but out here in California, once a
01:14:08.96 --> 01:14:11.96 sun goes down, it cool off really quickly.
01:14:11.96 --> 01:14:15.96 You don't have a sweatshirt, whether you need to do I.
01:14:15.96 --> 01:14:19.96 You've got a sweatshirt in your bag.
01:14:19.96 --> 01:14:23.96 Maybe I have one too because actually this is a contradiction because if I don't bring one,
01:14:23.96 --> 01:14:24.96 that means I'm not well prepared.
01:14:24.96 --> 01:14:25.96 Yeah.
01:14:25.96 --> 01:14:26.96 So I got one in my bag.
01:14:26.96 --> 01:14:27.96 Right.
01:14:27.96 --> 01:14:28.96 I'm not going to put it on.
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:29.96 Take it out.
01:14:29.96 --> 01:14:30.96 You put it on your way.
01:14:30.96 --> 01:14:31.96 No, I'm not even going to do that.
01:14:31.96 --> 01:14:32.96 I'm not even going to do that.
01:14:32.96 --> 01:14:33.96 Just going to leave it.
01:14:33.96 --> 01:14:36.96 You would not want to, you just want to be TF as long as you can.
01:14:36.96 --> 01:14:37.96 Yeah.
01:14:37.96 --> 01:14:41.96 I don't want to, I don't want to, you to see me putting on a sweatshirt, indicating to you that I was
01:14:41.96 --> 01:14:42.96 cold enough.
01:14:42.96 --> 01:14:45.96 I'm going to, I'm going to pamper myself, not happening.
01:14:45.96 --> 01:14:47.96 What if I wasn't there?
01:14:47.96 --> 01:14:49.96 Proud about put the sweatshirt on all day long.
01:14:49.96 --> 01:14:51.96 Yeah, this is straight up.
01:14:51.96 --> 01:14:53.96 No, there's no denying that.
01:14:53.96 --> 01:14:59.96 Yeah, that's so funny because before I thought like that, I would have thought that's so dumb.
01:14:59.96 --> 01:15:02.96 Like, put in your sweat, you're ruining your experience or whatever.
01:15:02.96 --> 01:15:04.96 You got to be each with your whatever friends.
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:07.96 You're going to do a search for this actually happened yesterday.
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:08.96 Proud.
01:15:08.96 --> 01:15:10.96 Are these out of surf contest?
01:15:10.96 --> 01:15:11.96 Yeah.
01:15:11.96 --> 01:15:14.96 And like the clouds came in and it got cool.
01:15:14.96 --> 01:15:14.96 Yeah.
01:15:14.96 --> 01:15:16.96 And my buddy, he was off.
01:15:16.96 --> 01:15:18.96 He was a hammer to go put a sweatshirt on.
01:15:18.96 --> 01:15:20.96 And I was like, oh, really?
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:21.96 I saw it.
01:15:21.96 --> 01:15:22.96 I see.
01:15:22.96 --> 01:15:24.96 Then we both went to gynax sweatshirts.
01:15:24.96 --> 01:15:25.96 But he let him do it.
01:15:25.96 --> 01:15:27.96 Yeah, he wasn't in teams too.
01:15:27.96 --> 01:15:28.96 Yeah, yeah.
01:15:28.96 --> 01:15:31.96 So I wasn't just trying to, because there's always that little thing going on in the team.
01:15:31.96 --> 01:15:34.96 Yeah, but I kind of feel like, and it goes on in general too.
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:37.96 Just, you know, yeah, fully like like you're going to rock in your shoe.
01:15:37.96 --> 01:15:40.96 Just don't just don't get it out.
01:15:40.96 --> 01:15:41.96 Just don't get it out.
01:15:41.96 --> 01:15:42.96 Leave it in there.
01:15:42.96 --> 01:15:43.96 Yeah.
01:15:43.96 --> 01:15:46.96 But before that episode with Tony, like, I would be the guy, be like, no, I'm cold.
01:15:46.96 --> 01:15:47.96 You know, I can't relate.
01:15:47.96 --> 01:15:50.96 But after that for some reason, I think you just morphed in my mind too.
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:53.96 Like, you just got beat TF and you kind of take pride.
01:15:53.96 --> 01:15:54.96 Yeah.
01:15:54.96 --> 01:15:56.96 Yeah.
01:15:56.96 --> 01:15:57.96 Yeah.
01:15:57.96 --> 01:15:58.96 Next.
01:15:58.96 --> 01:16:06.96 As Samurai, you should take it upon yourself to spend time playing in a water.
01:16:06.96 --> 01:16:11.96 Not doing so could well result in disaster.
01:16:11.96 --> 01:16:13.96 That's part one.
01:16:13.96 --> 01:16:15.96 Obviously, I agree with that one.
01:16:15.96 --> 01:16:17.96 You got to be in the water.
01:16:17.96 --> 01:16:24.96 Part two, Samurai should as a matter of course, engage in contest, substraint.
01:16:24.96 --> 01:16:28.96 If you're not, then your muscles will become slack.
01:16:28.96 --> 01:16:30.96 Obviously, I support that one.
01:16:30.96 --> 01:16:33.96 I don't know if this guy would just want to read this book.
01:16:33.96 --> 01:16:34.96 Yeah.
01:16:34.96 --> 01:16:36.96 Is he knew that I was going to be, I mean, how could you not?
01:16:36.96 --> 01:16:39.96 How does that not relate to everything that I talk about all the time?
01:16:39.96 --> 01:16:40.96 Yeah.
01:16:40.96 --> 01:16:42.96 Be in the water.
01:16:42.96 --> 01:16:44.96 Work out.
01:16:44.96 --> 01:16:46.96 Here's what's funny about this one.
01:16:46.96 --> 01:16:52.96 Oh, he says that the peasants strengthen themselves with their day to day labor.
01:16:52.96 --> 01:16:56.96 They also tested themselves by lifting and carrying large stones in front of the local shrines
01:16:56.96 --> 01:17:01.96 and did pushups in order to build their muscles and thereby increase their overall strength.
01:17:01.96 --> 01:17:08.96 However, beginning in the Meiji era, such feats of strength became began to be ridiculed
01:17:08.96 --> 01:17:11.96 and the use of rocks to indelde.
01:17:11.96 --> 01:17:17.96 Thus, it is hardly a surprise that the youth of today are weak.
01:17:17.96 --> 01:17:18.96 Yeah.
01:17:18.96 --> 01:17:22.96 And also, it's kind of like that now.
01:17:22.96 --> 01:17:26.96 Let's say quote unquote, grown adults.
01:17:26.96 --> 01:17:28.96 Let's see who can lift that rock.
01:17:28.96 --> 01:17:30.96 That's cool, though, right?
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:32.96 Why are you saying it weird voice?
01:17:32.96 --> 01:17:34.96 No, because I would say generally speaking, that's kind of like,
01:17:34.96 --> 01:17:36.96 oh, you chat, children.
01:17:36.96 --> 01:17:37.96 You know, like, what are you guys doing?
01:17:37.96 --> 01:17:38.96 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
01:17:38.96 --> 01:17:39.96 You can make fun of that?
01:17:39.96 --> 01:17:41.96 Yeah, if you don't know, I can feel pizza strength.
01:17:41.96 --> 01:17:42.96 I think competitions.
01:17:42.96 --> 01:17:45.96 What do you think the CrossFit games are, though?
01:17:45.96 --> 01:17:46.96 Yeah.
01:17:46.96 --> 01:17:48.96 Just world-strongest manners.
01:17:48.96 --> 01:17:56.96 Yes, I think the UFC is totally agree, but I think if it's not like organized and then like presented, you know, kind of thing.
01:17:56.96 --> 01:18:00.96 Like, if me and you were just cruising at the beach and then I'm like, oh, that's funny.
01:18:00.96 --> 01:18:05.96 We did me and being how like went to Australia.
01:18:05.96 --> 01:18:06.96 Right.
01:18:06.96 --> 01:18:10.96 And we're like, all cruising some downtime, we're filming this, this, you know, this video.
01:18:10.96 --> 01:18:14.96 And Brad just turned into that, well, 100%.
01:18:14.96 --> 01:18:17.96 It was just me and him. So we went from pushups.
01:18:17.96 --> 01:18:23.96 He was like, hey, what about the challenge you did, the challenge you did in Maine?
01:18:23.96 --> 01:18:25.96 Yeah, perfect.
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:26.96 Yeah, perfect.
01:18:26.96 --> 01:18:28.96 Yeah, that's like the lift it got a shoulder to the back.
01:18:28.96 --> 01:18:30.96 Yeah, a gravel, by the way.
01:18:30.96 --> 01:18:33.96 So it's not like a 200 pound bar belt.
01:18:33.96 --> 01:18:33.96 Right.
01:18:33.96 --> 01:18:34.96 Gravel thing.
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:36.96 Yeah, seeing that's a perfect example.
01:18:36.96 --> 01:18:38.96 But that makes you strong.
01:18:38.96 --> 01:18:39.96 I think so too.
01:18:39.96 --> 01:18:40.96 Yeah, I agree with it.
01:18:40.96 --> 01:18:46.96 I'm just, I'm just saying like, if let's say we're all at a like a part of barbecue with
01:18:46.96 --> 01:18:50.96 like just a vast variety, but like that's totally acceptable.
01:18:50.96 --> 01:18:53.96 You know, the 200 pound bag challenge.
01:18:53.96 --> 01:18:59.96 It's all just guys, like, you know, but if we were at a barbecue, you know, let's say my daughter was a birthday party.
01:18:59.96 --> 01:19:00.96 Yeah.
01:19:00.96 --> 01:19:02.96 Yeah, but you know, your kettlebell's out, right?
01:19:02.96 --> 01:19:03.96 Yeah.
01:19:03.96 --> 01:19:09.96 If I challenge you to the kettlebell, like, let's see who can do the night.
01:19:09.96 --> 01:19:13.96 Whatever the 90 pound one or something at my daughter's birthday party.
01:19:13.96 --> 01:19:19.96 I think aside from me, you and me, handful of other guys that are our direct peers.
01:19:19.96 --> 01:19:19.96 Yeah.
01:19:19.96 --> 01:19:20.96 It's like from them.
01:19:20.96 --> 01:19:22.96 I think people would be like, you guys are dull.
01:19:22.96 --> 01:19:23.96 Hmm.
01:19:23.96 --> 01:19:24.96 That's what I think.
01:19:24.96 --> 01:19:25.96 They might be right.
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:26.96 They might be right.
01:19:26.96 --> 01:19:28.96 All right.
01:19:28.96 --> 01:19:29.96 Next.
01:19:32.96 --> 01:19:38.96 If you allow your samurai spirit to wither, clearly your body will then follow suit.
01:19:38.96 --> 01:19:43.96 Your skin will begin to stretch as you gain weight.
01:19:43.96 --> 01:19:45.96 Part one.
01:19:45.96 --> 01:19:47.96 I think we all disagree with the green.
01:19:47.96 --> 01:19:48.96 That was right.
01:19:48.96 --> 01:19:55.96 Do you think that this goes back to the comfort question?
01:19:55.96 --> 01:19:57.96 Let's take you, Jitu.
01:19:57.96 --> 01:20:03.96 At a certain point where you say, I don't really care if I get caught by this guy or I'm, you know what?
01:20:03.96 --> 01:20:10.96 I'm that guy's training for worlds and hey, if you catch his me, you know what I mean?
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:11.96 Yeah.
01:20:11.96 --> 01:20:12.96 Yeah.
01:20:12.96 --> 01:20:13.96 I see what you're asking.
01:20:13.96 --> 01:20:19.96 So my point is, at a certain point, you accept it.
01:20:19.96 --> 01:20:21.96 Yeah.
01:20:21.96 --> 01:20:23.96 I think that's okay.
01:20:23.96 --> 01:20:24.96 I do think it's okay.
01:20:24.96 --> 01:20:25.96 I don't.
01:20:25.96 --> 01:20:26.96 I know you don't.
01:20:26.96 --> 01:20:28.96 And it's not an absolute, yes.
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:30.96 We're not on the door.
01:20:30.96 --> 01:20:33.96 When the door is, you know, hey, it's okay.
01:20:33.96 --> 01:20:34.96 Yeah.
01:20:34.96 --> 01:20:37.96 I'm, I'm all the excuses, right?
01:20:37.96 --> 01:20:38.96 Yeah.
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:44.96 Hey, you know, these guys are young and they're training for the, the, the, this competition or that competition.
01:20:44.96 --> 01:20:46.96 You've got to get in there with them.
01:20:46.96 --> 01:20:48.96 When I hear that knocking, I slam the door.
01:20:48.96 --> 01:20:49.96 Yeah.
01:20:49.96 --> 01:20:50.96 Red flag on.
01:20:50.96 --> 01:20:51.96 Yeah.
01:20:51.96 --> 01:20:52.96 Finally.
01:20:52.96 --> 01:20:53.96 Actually, I opened the door and I choked that person out.
01:20:53.96 --> 01:20:54.96 Bring it.
01:20:54.96 --> 01:20:55.96 Yeah.
01:20:55.96 --> 01:20:56.96 I dig it and I'm not.
01:20:56.96 --> 01:20:59.96 You can see, but I think if that, when you accept that, I feel, you know,
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:01.96 when you accept it, yeah.
01:21:01.96 --> 01:21:04.96 And the other thing that happens is your ego gets in the way, right?
01:21:04.96 --> 01:21:05.96 Yeah.
01:21:05.96 --> 01:21:08.96 Because because what happens is you don't want to, you don't want to get tapped out.
01:21:08.96 --> 01:21:09.96 Yeah.
01:21:09.96 --> 01:21:10.96 That's bad.
01:21:10.96 --> 01:21:11.96 Yeah.
01:21:11.96 --> 01:21:12.96 So you don't want to get tapped out so you're not going to try it.
01:21:12.96 --> 01:21:13.96 Yeah.
01:21:13.96 --> 01:21:14.96 And it, right?
01:21:14.96 --> 01:21:15.96 Right.
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:15.96 That happens.
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:16.96 Yeah.
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:20.96 And it's all different things that all kind of enter into the equation.
01:21:20.96 --> 01:21:23.96 So again, it, it comes back to like, why are you, why are you training?
01:21:23.96 --> 01:21:24.96 Like, why are you there?
01:21:24.96 --> 01:21:26.96 Injuditsu or whatever.
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:27.96 Like why are you there?
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:33.96 So yeah, if this thing, what he's talking about, where it's like, okay, if you're like letting yourself go, if you're kind of giving up.
01:21:33.96 --> 01:21:37.96 And then justifying it with in this case, oh, I'm older training for world.
01:21:37.96 --> 01:21:41.96 And that's your, your version of giving up.
01:21:41.96 --> 01:21:42.96 Then yeah, that's bad.
01:21:42.96 --> 01:21:46.96 But if it's like, let's say you're like an older guy or whatever.
01:21:46.96 --> 01:21:49.96 And maybe you kind of lost a step or whatever.
01:21:49.96 --> 01:21:52.96 You know, like, like, people do when they get older sometimes.
01:21:52.96 --> 01:22:00.96 And you're like, hey, you know, this guy is getting nuts. If I rise to that level of intensity, I could get heard or something like that.
01:22:00.96 --> 01:22:02.96 And it's like in, in, okay, yeah.
01:22:02.96 --> 01:22:04.96 Okay, you know, you can be smart.
01:22:04.96 --> 01:22:05.96 Yeah.
01:22:05.96 --> 01:22:05.96 Right.
01:22:05.96 --> 01:22:06.96 Yeah.
01:22:06.96 --> 01:22:10.96 For instance, if everyone's doing take downs and you're knees a little bit tweaked, you know what?
01:22:10.96 --> 01:22:11.96 Exactly.
01:22:11.96 --> 01:22:12.96 Right.
01:22:12.96 --> 01:22:14.96 That's something I need to check myself on sometimes.
01:22:14.96 --> 01:22:15.96 Yeah.
01:22:15.96 --> 01:22:15.96 You do.
01:22:15.96 --> 01:22:17.96 Big talk actually.
01:22:17.96 --> 01:22:18.96 Yeah.
01:22:18.96 --> 01:22:20.96 But makes it.
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:24.96 But that's a big one though. Like when you when you start like what I'm talking about.
01:22:24.96 --> 01:22:25.96 Yeah.
01:22:25.96 --> 01:22:28.96 What it is is you when you allow your samurai spirit to wither.
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:29.96 That's what we're talking about.
01:22:29.96 --> 01:22:29.96 Yeah.
01:22:29.96 --> 01:22:31.96 When you start saying, hey, you know what?
01:22:31.96 --> 01:22:35.96 I'd rather still just keep fighting, even though you're getting beat because the young
01:22:35.96 --> 01:22:39.96 buck is coming up and you're going to get in the train more than you and you got to work and
01:22:39.96 --> 01:22:39.96 Yeah.
01:22:39.96 --> 01:22:41.96 Hey, you know what? Come time me out then.
01:22:41.96 --> 01:22:42.96 Yeah.
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:42.96 Yeah.
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:45.96 You still got to like maintain the spirit.
01:22:45.96 --> 01:22:46.96 Yeah.
01:22:46.96 --> 01:22:46.96 Yeah.
01:22:46.96 --> 01:22:47.96 Yeah.
01:22:47.96 --> 01:22:53.96 A lot of times when people get married or they they stop training or whatever and they they
01:22:53.96 --> 01:22:56.96 Blame it on the marriage or they blame it on their career.
01:22:56.96 --> 01:22:56.96 Yeah.
01:22:56.96 --> 01:22:58.96 Something like that is like, ah, you could.
01:22:58.96 --> 01:22:59.96 I lost.
01:22:59.96 --> 01:22:59.96 Yeah.
01:22:59.96 --> 01:23:03.96 You know what I do when people say that people say, I'll say, oh, you know,
01:23:03.96 --> 01:23:04.96 someone talking to someone.
01:23:04.96 --> 01:23:06.96 No, you don't manage to train a lot.
01:23:06.96 --> 01:23:09.96 And I'll be like, oh, I mean, oh, what what happened?
01:23:09.96 --> 01:23:12.96 And thus we know I got two kids and you know, I just working a lot.
01:23:12.96 --> 01:23:13.96 I was like, oh, yeah.
01:23:13.96 --> 01:23:14.96 I got four kids.
01:23:14.96 --> 01:23:16.96 Yeah.
01:23:16.96 --> 01:23:17.96 I was like, oh, yeah.
01:23:17.96 --> 01:23:18.96 And they're driven in their defense.
01:23:18.96 --> 01:23:19.96 Everybody's different.
01:23:19.96 --> 01:23:20.96 Yeah.
01:23:20.96 --> 01:23:23.96 If they have two kids in the four, they're not you and kids aren't here.
01:23:23.96 --> 01:23:26.96 So, yes, that's my wife was good.
01:23:26.96 --> 01:23:27.96 Yeah.
01:23:27.96 --> 01:23:28.96 Yeah.
01:23:28.96 --> 01:23:29.96 Oh, that's a bit embarrassing.
01:23:29.96 --> 01:23:30.96 It does make it hard.
01:23:30.96 --> 01:23:31.96 It totally does.
01:23:31.96 --> 01:23:32.96 And it does make it harder.
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:34.96 With the kids and a career and stuff like that.
01:23:34.96 --> 01:23:35.96 It's easy.
01:23:35.96 --> 01:23:36.96 Yeah.
01:23:36.96 --> 01:23:37.96 That's what I was going to say.
01:23:37.96 --> 01:23:38.96 It's like.
01:23:38.96 --> 01:23:39.96 baby sili it.
01:23:39.96 --> 01:23:43.96 It's invalid at the end of the day because you either get your toy or your sunrise.
01:23:43.96 --> 01:23:50.44 your summer ice spirit or you didn't and if you didn't then you allowed these things which are true by the way
01:23:50.44 --> 01:23:55.000 by your as far as what you're not you but obviously this person is hypothetical person
01:23:55.80 --> 01:24:01.40 if they're career or family got in the way you allowed that to happen it's not easy totally not easy
01:24:02.12 --> 01:24:09.16 sub to you though at the end of the day I think samurai are never without a sword on their hip
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:16.52 this means of course that an unarmed enemy will arm himself so you got always expect in my mind
01:24:17.08 --> 01:24:24.84 always expect that your opponent is gonna be armed business life whatever you're doing always
01:24:24.84 --> 01:24:32.92 you can always expect that your opponent is ready I always expect them to be ready next
01:24:32.92 --> 01:24:39.08 as a samurai you should take care as to where your feet step as a matter of course
01:24:40.20 --> 01:24:45.80 you never want to be off balance in case the unexpected occurs well that's pretty self-explanatory
01:24:46.44 --> 01:24:47.16 the amplifying
01:24:48.60 --> 01:24:51.88 information says samurai have to keep themselves prepared at all times you respond
01:24:53.56 --> 01:24:58.68 they have to be able to react calmly in a situation without any panic boom again does that apply
01:24:58.68 --> 01:25:06.76 to everything yes it does no doubt about it samurai who are not aware of the things they should
01:25:06.76 --> 01:25:15.80 know are like cats that do not know how to catch mice not aware of things they should know
01:25:17.40 --> 01:25:25.80 yeah samurai should be continuously thinking about military manners matters
01:25:25.80 --> 01:25:34.92 fail to do this at your peril those that serve in the military should be in a continuous state of
01:25:34.92 --> 01:25:40.68 thinking of warfare to be negligent in this will result in failure and defeat
01:25:44.52 --> 01:25:48.68 you know I told this I tell us the young military people that I work with
01:25:48.68 --> 01:25:55.56 that this is your job this is your profession and you're going to do everything you can to master it
01:25:56.36 --> 01:26:02.20 and that means what is being said right here continuously thinking about military manners matters
01:26:05.88 --> 01:26:08.84 any samurai who spends too much time playing ball
01:26:08.84 --> 01:26:19.32 coat-o-gitar plucking the mouth harp or playing the flute are liable to become a coward
01:26:19.32 --> 01:26:23.64 and here it says those in the military should never become overly infatuated with
01:26:23.64 --> 01:26:29.48 diversionary games okay now at some point I'd like to get better at guitar but apparently
01:26:29.48 --> 01:26:39.32 you know I'm gonna bring things to the world next while a samurai maybe clumsy about some
01:26:39.32 --> 01:26:44.92 things the spear the horse and the bow should not be among them I like that
01:26:47.64 --> 01:26:54.36 this one is key samurai should make a habit of regularly listening to tales of military combat
01:26:54.36 --> 01:27:04.20 and rely on the learning found therein this is a blatant plug for jockel podcast
01:27:05.56 --> 01:27:11.16 and here's the amplifying information by listening to such tales regularly it will keep
01:27:11.16 --> 01:27:20.92 them fresh in your mind when actual combat arises they will be of benefit boom boom and I've
01:27:20.92 --> 01:27:26.52 definitely got that feedback I've gotten all kinds of good feedback about that from guys in the military
01:27:27.08 --> 01:27:31.32 that they can relate because I'm telling you the stories that we tell over and over again
01:27:32.44 --> 01:27:38.36 their stories that happen there real things yeah fire maneuver there's people acting weird there's
01:27:38.36 --> 01:27:43.48 the enemy doing things these things are real and it is definitely helpful the more you I wish I
01:27:43.48 --> 01:27:49.16 would have known more when I was in I would have been infinitely better you haven't
01:27:49.16 --> 01:27:53.40 enough of focus on it though yeah kind of goes for everything to yeah like because it kind of
01:27:53.40 --> 01:28:02.28 keeps your whole like approach to life in that that battle frame you know yeah so everything you
01:28:02.28 --> 01:28:06.20 know like gives you different perspectives and I talk about this all the time if if you learn
01:28:06.20 --> 01:28:12.04 the arm bar right from the mount you learn it one way but you don't realize man there's there's
01:28:12.04 --> 01:28:17.000 infinitely different ways to do it you can get it from the guard you can get it from the bottom
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.60 position you can get it from a cross side you can get all the you can get the arm lock from all these
01:28:20.60 --> 01:28:24.68 different positions yeah and every time you see it from a different angle you get better at all of
01:28:24.68 --> 01:28:28.68 them yeah so every time you see a military situation from a different angle from a leadership
01:28:28.68 --> 01:28:32.84 perspective from the ground true perspective from the cold from the hot from the desert from the
01:28:32.84 --> 01:28:39.48 mountains you learn something it makes you better at it yeah so so looking at things through that
01:28:39.48 --> 01:28:44.04 front you know whatever it may be whether it be military history whatever you're always kind of looking
01:28:44.04 --> 01:28:51.000 at things in that way yeah like this guy we call them uncle Jill he's my friend of the family
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.84 and how why and oh yeah and he's he was a really good artist but he used to climb trees and
01:28:56.84 --> 01:29:01.40 take us just tree climbing I don't really know maybe things actually me talking about it right now
01:29:01.40 --> 01:29:07.56 but it was super good fun this guy he'd always be like well there's there's an instinctive of
01:29:08.36 --> 01:29:12.28 climbing right p i think humans have an instinctive climb things yeah I'm
01:29:12.28 --> 01:29:16.84 excited I don't know it seems like yeah okay and the air it would be weird because he
01:29:16.84 --> 01:29:22.28 pulled out that climbing thing he'd be like a bad I could climb up there you know that it's kind
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:27.56 like dang if you kind of have these like looking at things through frames that are that are useful
01:29:27.56 --> 01:29:31.64 you know like I think like but it's like man you can figure a lot of things out that you
01:29:31.64 --> 01:29:36.04 a lot of people wouldn't figure out you know like I know Viva was like that for sure but like
01:29:36.04 --> 01:29:40.52 that's like a good shot how that you know no one's no care that's just a beach or whatever but
01:29:40.52 --> 01:29:48.68 I was a young and listed guy and I had a friend that would he would kind of like your friend
01:29:48.68 --> 01:29:53.32 like like to climb things this guy would jump off the hook. Uncle Joe would climb things this guy
01:29:53.32 --> 01:29:59.72 would jump off the hook and we were on this obstacle course this random obstacle course and he
01:29:59.72 --> 01:30:04.68 climbed he would also like to climb but then he got to the top of this thing he was probably
01:30:04.68 --> 01:30:12.36 let's call it 18 feet and I'm I slid down the rope and the other guy slid down the rope and
01:30:12.36 --> 01:30:18.12 the chief that we were with slid down the rope and I look up and he goes and he's kind of
01:30:18.12 --> 01:30:25.48 got like a puzzle look on his face. The jumper the jumper's got like a curious look on his face.
01:30:25.48 --> 01:30:32.60 Yeah inquisitive yeah and he says I think I could jump down this 18 feet and I go do it
01:30:32.60 --> 01:30:42.60 and the chief goes don't do it and he said I think I could make it and I said do it and the
01:30:42.60 --> 01:30:52.68 chief says don't do it and I go 10 bucks and the chief goes shot up Joko don't do it and I go
01:30:53.80 --> 01:31:00.92 20 bucks and he goes shot up I'm not as he's saying that the jumper jumped and he made it
01:31:00.92 --> 01:31:07.72 just like 18 feet down just landed PLF yeah parachute landing fall. It's like you break the
01:31:07.72 --> 01:31:12.60 flying fall down and roll okay yeah it's almost like a judo fall but with your yeah kind of like
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:20.36 it disperses like the way he does he did it it's good man 18 yeah it's good in a good hard
01:31:20.36 --> 01:31:25.40 good way you could have gotten her no it would have been your fall yeah all that kind of thing
01:31:25.40 --> 01:31:31.72 it would have been yeah I know I know you knew his jumping weakness yeah his addiction to jumping
01:31:31.72 --> 01:31:39.56 and you exploited it next samurai should keep in their hearts the fact that they only die once
01:31:39.56 --> 01:31:46.92 forgetting this will result in failure samurai who forget this this is so this this one's a
01:31:46.92 --> 01:31:50.68 little bit tricky for me to understand samurai should keep in their hearts the fact that they
01:31:50.68 --> 01:31:57.000 only die once forgetting this will result in failure and the amplification on this one says
01:31:57.80 --> 01:32:04.52 samurai who forget that they can die at any time and in any place could end up in humiliating failure
01:32:05.96 --> 01:32:11.000 in other words throwing your body into the river and relying on fate to determine
01:32:11.64 --> 01:32:18.28 if you float to the shallows if you love your life too much you will always end in failure so this is
01:32:18.28 --> 01:32:22.60 what I found interesting about this one there's an dichotomy here the dichotomy to me is
01:32:23.72 --> 01:32:28.76 if if you care too much about being alive then you won't take any risk and you'll be too
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:33.08 scared and you'll that's gonna be bad yeah so that's that we know that that one's bad so we know
01:32:33.08 --> 01:32:37.56 we get that one if you love your life too much you will always end in failure maybe not always but
01:32:37.56 --> 01:32:42.76 it's gonna definitely play a role you'll be too cautious you won't take any risk you'll be scared
01:32:42.76 --> 01:32:50.60 that one's gonna be you'll hesitate yeah so we get that one the keeping your hearts that you'll only
01:32:50.60 --> 01:32:58.36 die once okay so that means to me okay so you can die at any time I'm gonna make it worth it
01:32:58.36 --> 01:33:04.44 in my mind make it dope yeah make it dope okay and then this whole thing about okay we read it
01:33:04.44 --> 01:33:10.44 board forward throwing your body into the river and relying on fate to determine if you float
01:33:10.44 --> 01:33:19.32 to the shallows I don't know to me that could be taken two ways and I think they're both okay
01:33:19.96 --> 01:33:25.16 number one is like hey don't just throw just just jump don't just jump into the river and see
01:33:25.16 --> 01:33:29.88 and let fate decide if you're gonna make it I don't know you prepare and you train and you're ready
01:33:32.60 --> 01:33:36.76 the other way it could be taken is you know what you can't control everything you got to go
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:42.20 jump into the river and if you if you're meant to make it you're gonna make it even one of those
01:33:42.20 --> 01:33:45.56 can possibly set your mind to be using what I mean you've heard me talk about here in a
01:33:45.56 --> 01:33:49.80 ten way the warrior kid right yeah way the warrior kid what happens you prepare everything you
01:33:49.80 --> 01:33:54.20 can but they eventually got to jump and see if the water the current takes you to the shallow water again
01:33:54.20 --> 01:33:59.40 that's the way it's got to be yeah so that's the way I took that one yeah I read a lot into that one
01:33:59.40 --> 01:34:03.56 I think the first one just because the other one would would add kind of additional
01:34:03.56 --> 01:34:09.64 like requirement required explanation like your story is you agree with preparing I think yeah
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:13.88 yeah I agree with preparing I think the of the two that you just said the first one I think makes
01:34:13.88 --> 01:34:17.08 more sense to me that that's what he meant so you're you're thinking that he meant
01:34:19.96 --> 01:34:25.32 to prepare the best of your ability yeah exactly like he like it's kind of like you only have one
01:34:25.32 --> 01:34:31.72 life and if you're gonna die make it legit don't be dying trying to cross the river you better die
01:34:31.72 --> 01:34:38.76 doing something be it I mean okay I think there's one more little addition that I believe that
01:34:38.76 --> 01:34:43.32 Eric actually added on here yeah this is his note it says the line about throwing your bond into
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:47.56 the river relying on fate to determine if you float in the shallow is very famous it's not
01:34:47.56 --> 01:34:53.96 that famous because I Google it back couldn't find it now he says enter battle fleek
01:34:53.96 --> 01:35:03.32 completely committed and perhaps you will emerge alive at the end I think that makes some sense for me
01:35:03.32 --> 01:35:08.60 prepare the best of your ability yeah be fully committed and then don't worry about what the
01:35:08.60 --> 01:35:15.56 end's gonna come because you can't control everything I think we're good I think okay now this one
01:35:15.56 --> 01:35:23.000 I had to I had to dig on this one a little bit too samurai study a great many things however the
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:34.92 single focus of their learning is death and then the the the amplifying information here
01:35:36.12 --> 01:35:41.80 is while samurai do intensive training and study a variety of topics what it all boils down to
01:35:41.80 --> 01:35:50.52 is seeking death so that that kind of that one I will I tried to figure out what that meant
01:35:50.52 --> 01:35:57.24 or at least what it means to me and I think to to the most positive way I could
01:35:57.24 --> 01:36:00.60 because seeking death right are you really seeking death is that what you're trying to do?
01:36:00.60 --> 01:36:05.80 Well no if you're you're not helping the cause if you're seeking death right you don't want to die
01:36:06.44 --> 01:36:10.84 that's not our goal it's an occurrence that could happen and matter fact that's gonna happen all of us
01:36:11.48 --> 01:36:17.32 but the way I look at it is what we're trying to learn we're trying to understand
01:36:17.32 --> 01:36:27.72 and master his death and the fear of death if we can get over that little little hurdle right then
01:36:27.72 --> 01:36:32.92 you've mastered that and once you're actually saying I'm going forward don't prepare it
01:36:33.64 --> 01:36:41.16 then we're good or could be also just like just you know as far as seeking challenges go you want
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:45.24 to seek one challenge and you want to seek a bigger challenge yeah but he says seeking death bro
01:36:45.24 --> 01:36:51.24 yeah so you're pursuing the ultimate challenge that beats you and I like that
01:36:51.24 --> 01:36:56.04 true what you have a point break come on yes point yes there you go where you know
01:36:56.04 --> 01:37:01.96 boaty he's looking for the the 50 year storm you remember the same thing so he's like I'm
01:37:01.96 --> 01:37:05.08 going to be there and all this stuff he's always trying to push the limit all these things
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:12.12 bankruptreats guy I mean all this stuff and you know find the 50 year storm no is it 100%
01:37:12.12 --> 01:37:19.96 knows it in fact I was kind of like his escape from the law catch one of those ways
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:26.20 dies everyone knew it did he really die or was there sequel where you lived he died it was all
01:37:26.20 --> 01:37:30.68 kind of I guess not that you mentioned it first there's room first he click exactly everybody was
01:37:30.68 --> 01:37:35.000 but then they make it people they write it the same movie yeah did you see that one no not bad
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.48 I see what they're doing there you know a little bit too like you could tell they're trying
01:37:39.48 --> 01:37:44.52 target maybe some teenagers or something like that but not bad sat through it glad it wasn't
01:37:44.52 --> 01:37:52.28 a waste of time you know some things all right this one again had to had to had to
01:37:52.28 --> 01:37:58.36 dig a little deeper on this one if you were to ask what what is it that concerns a samurai
01:37:59.24 --> 01:38:08.92 the answer is I want to live I want to live okay so to break that down a little bit I
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:15.48 look at the word concerns and what concerns means is worries or troubles it's not yeah I don't think
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:21.16 they're using them more like oh that that concerns me yeah like like it's not saying hey what what
01:38:21.16 --> 01:38:27.56 concerns me or what I'm thinking about it's what I'm worried about what I'm worried about is someone
01:38:27.56 --> 01:38:31.56 that's saying I want to live I want to live yeah that's what they're worried about because
01:38:31.56 --> 01:38:34.76 someone that's saying I want to live and I think you can apply this to a lot of stuff let's
01:38:34.76 --> 01:38:39.96 take negotiation right you get negotiation with somebody if you're saying I want to win this deal I
01:38:39.96 --> 01:38:44.92 want to steal I want to you're out of position of weakness yeah yeah so even in business you can't
01:38:44.92 --> 01:38:47.72 have the position if I want to live I want to live I want to live I want to score this deal
01:38:47.72 --> 01:38:52.44 I want to make I want to get this deal done like no if you're actually negotiating you need to be
01:38:52.44 --> 01:38:57.32 able to walk away from the deal and say no we're done I'm out strangely they say the same thing
01:38:57.32 --> 01:39:05.16 about picking up girls same thing yes if you're all I hope I get this girl I hope get this girl that
01:39:05.16 --> 01:39:10.52 girl doesn't want to be with a guy that's just British red dude yeah the amplification here
01:39:10.52 --> 01:39:15.64 says an answer to the question what do samurai worry about the answer is having the desire to
01:39:15.64 --> 01:39:22.28 extend their own life is something worth regretting samurai who value their own lives are not worth
01:39:22.28 --> 01:39:32.84 a far thing yeah so we've got that's I think you need to be able to set aside that
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:40.92 well I think it applies to everything I think so yeah if you're so concerned like in
01:39:40.92 --> 01:39:46.60 jiu jitsu if you're just totally concerned about winning and not tapping out yeah you're not going to learn
01:39:46.60 --> 01:39:51.32 yeah and and even worse you're not going to compete you're not even rolling that's going to do well yeah
01:39:51.32 --> 01:40:00.60 and you're so apprehensive and yeah yeah to play so I sure sure here's a good one it is important to
01:40:00.60 --> 01:40:10.12 understand that should the mirror in a samurai's heart be unclouded then the opponent will be clearly
01:40:10.12 --> 01:40:21.16 reflected in it good one amplification any samurai whose will is firm can be described as having
01:40:21.16 --> 01:40:28.44 a mind that is unclouded so if your will is firm think about that if your will is firm you can be
01:40:28.44 --> 01:40:34.12 described as having a mind that is unclouded in such a state the strength of weakness of the opponent
01:40:34.12 --> 01:40:48.92 will be perfectly reflected next samurai cast off thoughts of both life and death their mind is set
01:40:48.92 --> 01:40:56.76 unmoving forward amplification samurai do not dwell even for a moment on whether they live or die
01:40:58.04 --> 01:41:05.48 fulfilling their mission requires samurai to advance it is what they do best what they were made for
01:41:08.28 --> 01:41:12.36 yeah that is I think that that one breaks down to
01:41:12.36 --> 01:41:19.000 you being able to clear your mind on what happened the last go around right not worried about
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.16 the future not worried about the black one you're doing something like if you're competing
01:41:24.28 --> 01:41:28.04 you make a mistake you have to put that out of your brain completely yeah and you need to
01:41:28.04 --> 01:41:32.68 okay the mistake happened or you did something great you can't jump up and now to be all happy about
01:41:32.68 --> 01:41:39.40 that you need to just clear your mind and keep the mind empty yeah you can't get freaked out about
01:41:39.40 --> 01:41:45.72 the next shot or the last shot yeah you we learn that in shooting like this is something you see
01:41:45.72 --> 01:41:50.52 all the time when we're shooting we do a little basically when you're shooting in the teams everything
01:41:50.52 --> 01:41:54.68 is a competition and you'd see a guy you're shooting ahead plates and they'd have six
01:41:54.68 --> 01:41:58.68 head plates in a row what's the steel plate about the size of a head and you got a shoot
01:41:58.68 --> 01:42:02.52 a minute and we shoot it you instantly know if you hit a risk because it was ping ping ping ping ping
01:42:02.52 --> 01:42:10.20 mm and if you see a guy that can't put the last one out of their head you know it's
01:42:10.20 --> 01:42:20.12 ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping
01:42:21.56 --> 01:42:28.76 mag change it's it's bad yeah a guy gets really good he'll miss and just he'll dismiss and he
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:35.08 doesn't even think about it you're you're ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping
01:42:35.08 --> 01:42:42.28 you just yeah no no factor yeah it's it is the proverbial choking you know like why is this
01:42:42.28 --> 01:42:47.16 good choking at the end on the ceiling it before you can train your mind to do that you can train
01:42:47.16 --> 01:42:51.88 your mind to do that so where you're just and actually when I'd be shooting a lot I could get to that
01:42:51.88 --> 01:42:57.16 point and then if I'm not shooting a bunch I would lose that and I'm gonna be like to ping
01:42:57.16 --> 01:43:01.40 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:43:01.40 --> 01:43:05.88 if you're shooting regularly you get that you get past that and then older you get the more you
01:43:05.88 --> 01:43:11.72 do it the more you can just say you don't don't care you know what a phrase would would always work
01:43:11.72 --> 01:43:16.20 with me when someone like you've got a coach or something where you know in football you'd have
01:43:16.20 --> 01:43:20.52 this where you're like you'd be winning the whole game mm-hmm you know and in the fourth quarter
01:43:20.52 --> 01:43:24.52 it's like oh my god we just let's run out the clock or I don't you have that feeling
01:43:24.52 --> 01:43:28.20 and guys at choke a lot of time and that's not to mention the other teams thinking the exact
01:43:28.20 --> 01:43:31.16 opposite we got nothing lose we're gonna hit him we're gonna take risks we're gonna do all
01:43:31.16 --> 01:43:36.68 you know so that's why guys can win or teams can win at the last minute even though they've been
01:43:36.68 --> 01:43:42.20 getting their ass kicked old game um fights kind of like that too but I don't know if I just seem
01:43:42.20 --> 01:43:45.56 to have like more of a wheel I don't know for some reason but either way either way I don't know
01:43:46.84 --> 01:43:51.64 but the phrase I would always help me is if someone would just put your might to end say finish
01:43:51.64 --> 01:43:56.04 strong just say finish strong but like yeah it's almost like they're gonna say punch it through
01:43:56.04 --> 01:44:01.72 or something you know something like that that indicates don't let up at the end mentally you know
01:44:01.72 --> 01:44:07.08 just go just keep pushing the way you but that is a little bit different then getting distracted by
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:11.48 what just happened yeah but because they say yeah it is a little bit different but in it's like
01:44:11.48 --> 01:44:15.32 what's your critical role when you played football what was it you were trying to do each play
01:44:16.20 --> 01:44:20.04 were you weren't you a receiver yeah okay so let's say you missed their catch that you should
01:44:20.04 --> 01:44:24.76 cut off you had to be able to put that out of your head right so it's just a mental state
01:44:24.76 --> 01:44:30.52 where it's like finished strong it's finished strong in your mind you know so yeah don't worry
01:44:30.52 --> 01:44:35.56 about your introduce it to get this all the time man when I'd win a match and then I'd win another
01:44:35.56 --> 01:44:41.32 one you know you gotta win like matches till the final after two matches I just start feeling this
01:44:41.32 --> 01:44:45.72 pressure like it's almost like one way my two match win streak is about to come to an end it's a
01:44:45.72 --> 01:44:48.84 little like the pressure and then you win one more and then the pressure is even on more
01:44:48.84 --> 01:44:54.84 is weird it's like I wish I was done it is weird oh but if someone would say something along
01:44:54.84 --> 01:44:58.92 the lines of finished strong it would just cure the whole thing because you're thinking about all
01:44:58.92 --> 01:45:03.88 these things that mentally throw you off if I don't know the pressure would say if you could
01:45:03.88 --> 01:45:08.92 somebody say something to you that would make you freak out even more yeah oh yeah like what
01:45:08.92 --> 01:45:14.68 would it freak out more if someone said oh you got this or if someone says hey at least you made
01:45:14.68 --> 01:45:20.12 it this far would you then back off but because when you're dealing with kids it would you know
01:45:20.12 --> 01:45:25.40 like I mean like I got kids you got kids too but you know when you got kids that are doing something
01:45:25.40 --> 01:45:31.48 competitive yeah like you did you do a wrestling and let's say they're winning and and you could tell
01:45:31.48 --> 01:45:37.32 them hey you've done good so far go out there and have fun which is cool yeah or you could say
01:45:37.32 --> 01:45:41.24 hey you need to focus more now but because these people are gonna be getting tougher yeah
01:45:41.24 --> 01:45:47.64 both of those to me with throw me up because when you say just relax you've made it this far that
01:45:47.64 --> 01:45:51.88 tells them that it's okay it did not to be to check out you know so it depends on what their
01:45:51.88 --> 01:45:55.56 state of mind is to go into that that comment or take into the situation where you say
01:45:55.56 --> 01:46:01.64 come to the time I feel like I want to tell people either people I'm coaching well no I
01:46:01.64 --> 01:46:06.52 shouldn't say that when I want to tell my kids relax go out there have fun go out there have a good
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:11.16 time yeah because I think that is easier on their brains and and to what your point was earlier
01:46:11.16 --> 01:46:17.88 when people let loose and they they don't feel the pressure they tend to perform better yeah
01:46:18.92 --> 01:46:25.96 yeah I agree with that fully but if it's like if that's like kind of the underlying attitude like
01:46:25.96 --> 01:46:31.000 relax have fun regardless of what Matt first match last finals match whatever then yes I think so
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000 but if it's like come on you you got this will you can do this you can do this and then right when
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.76 it gets to the final then you say okay yeah you need this far so it's like your side that's bad I think
01:46:40.76 --> 01:46:45.80 he can be bad you know how they take it but if they take it like I didn't say relax yeah I said go
01:46:45.80 --> 01:46:51.08 out there and have I go out there and do what you do I say that a lot okay so if you say you made it this far
01:46:51.08 --> 01:46:56.84 MMA find to be like hey do what you do that's good to say if someone told me that go do what you
01:46:56.84 --> 01:47:01.08 do that would really be in the garden go do what you do yeah that's good stuff to say to me
01:47:01.08 --> 01:47:07.80 but anything to put pressure on me like if you do this you win like you know like one more
01:47:07.80 --> 01:47:12.36 match and that's it no but I'll tell you what's interesting like with coaching MMA if you would
01:47:12.36 --> 01:47:18.04 get a guy and get it into a guy's head do not get taken down and they'd go in there without you
01:47:18.04 --> 01:47:22.52 you'd be really hard to take that person down yeah and when and you'd say it soon if you get taken
01:47:22.52 --> 01:47:26.76 down it's soon before you even get on the ground you get back up you get that people with that
01:47:26.76 --> 01:47:30.92 mind that going and it'd be really hard for someone to take them down and hold them up because they can panic it
01:47:30.92 --> 01:47:39.08 yeah maybe basically pick up get you know yeah so interesting here's a good one
01:47:40.04 --> 01:47:48.36 and this is actually the last one fittingly not engaging in any form of study will cause your
01:47:48.36 --> 01:48:00.20 mind to wander this will result in your spirit becoming unfocused then the amplification there is
01:48:00.20 --> 01:48:05.40 nothing wrong with daydreaming but if you study your spirit will become focused on and shape
01:48:05.40 --> 01:48:13.48 to deal with a certain thing that shape will then become lost in turn there is a song that
01:48:13.48 --> 01:48:19.72 goes the drifting and becoming lost is what the mind does it becomes your spirit the mind of your
01:48:19.72 --> 01:48:33.08 spirit do not allow your mind to do this and yeah I think that that's that's something that we
01:48:33.08 --> 01:48:42.44 actually talk about all the time in fact that may be the very purpose of me doing everything that we do
01:48:42.44 --> 01:48:52.28 which is you know studying and learning and to go back to the question that that Eric the
01:48:52.28 --> 01:48:59.56 translator posed to me can any of the rules in this book apply to modern warfare as I said not only
01:48:59.56 --> 01:49:05.08 do they apply to modern warfare they apply to life and the thing is there's nothing really new here
01:49:05.08 --> 01:49:15.56 right just like an arm lock there's nothing really new here but that doesn't mean that there's
01:49:15.56 --> 01:49:21.64 nothing really new here there's always something new we sure we've heard these lessons before right
01:49:22.20 --> 01:49:27.000 we've heard them from dick winners we've heard them from Bob Hoffman we've heard them from general
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:36.44 patent and hack worth and we heard them from wooden leg and I said this on the first podcast that we did
01:49:37.16 --> 01:49:47.32 the first podcast that we did I said you know what to do you know to be balanced
01:49:48.60 --> 01:49:53.24 and you know to work out and you know not to be gluttonous with food and you know you should
01:49:53.24 --> 01:50:00.92 sleep late and you know you should keep things clean and organized and you know that your struggles
01:50:00.92 --> 01:50:14.44 now will be rewarded in the future so you must endure indoor indoor the hardship indoor the suffering
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:24.76 indoor the pain of discipline indoor the pain of discipline so that in the future you can have
01:50:24.76 --> 01:50:34.20 the reward and we know what that reward is the reward for discipline is freedom
01:50:34.20 --> 01:50:53.88 and I think that is all I've got for tonight so echo speaking of rewards and freedom and trying to
01:50:53.88 --> 01:51:01.32 get better do you have any suggestions on maybe some ways to get better for people
01:51:01.32 --> 01:51:08.28 sure ways that might also at the same time simultaneously support this podcast if people want to
01:51:08.28 --> 01:51:15.96 sure do something like that they want to also I think it is important and beneficial to add that
01:51:15.96 --> 01:51:21.40 you know when you endure the suffering pain that's metaphor for the most part sometimes it's
01:51:21.40 --> 01:51:29.24 real pain oh yeah and suffering real real but you do that enough and you get used to it
01:51:29.24 --> 01:51:34.12 and to the point where you kind of like require it in a way like you kind of want to like you know
01:51:34.12 --> 01:51:43.40 how are you still going like you know like a strict diet and I'd be hungry a lot but at the
01:51:43.40 --> 01:51:49.08 same time the diet would be really effective with a good workout program and then so when I go off
01:51:49.08 --> 01:51:53.40 the program you kind of you know you feel kind of almost like for lack of better term like toxic like
01:51:53.40 --> 01:52:00.68 or just a sack of you know you almost I kind of miss that hunger and the you know the
01:52:00.68 --> 01:52:04.84 because you kind of associate the hunger that you always have with like being in good shape and
01:52:04.84 --> 01:52:09.40 and like a proper point it kind of like that's an example of like how it can be you know you know
01:52:09.40 --> 01:52:12.92 like yeah no that's good you're eating a lot I don't know it's weird you don't even have to
01:52:12.92 --> 01:52:18.44 amplify you do it like when you're on the program yeah kind of feels good that you're on the
01:52:18.44 --> 01:52:23.48 program you're suffering for sure there's something called unquote suffering there but they feel good
01:52:23.48 --> 01:52:30.28 and especially when you think about the opposite of that which is when you're off the program
01:52:30.28 --> 01:52:37.72 yes and you feel like a wrap yeah and yeah what do you do to make yourself feel better what do you
01:52:37.72 --> 01:52:43.16 do instead of going on the program you said you go to the you go to the sleeve orios yeah that's
01:52:43.16 --> 01:52:47.80 the answer yeah because that's like that's the that's the wrong answer yeah that's the good that's the
01:52:47.80 --> 01:52:55.24 instant gratification yeah right that's the opposite of struggling now yeah you're you're you're
01:52:55.24 --> 01:53:00.60 you're you're not enduring now you're not facing the pain of discipline now you're looking for
01:53:00.60 --> 01:53:04.84 a short term rewards so that's why that's why I said it said in the book I said in the book
01:53:04.84 --> 01:53:10.28 the field manual right like when you're on the path it's it's easier to stay on the path I
01:53:10.28 --> 01:53:16.76 when you fall off the path yeah yeah people people just get they go the downward spiral yeah that's
01:53:16.76 --> 01:53:21.64 like you fall for the trick and this I have mentioned this as a trick you're my trick so like you
01:53:21.64 --> 01:53:27.32 like that you're getting it is friends you know when you you fall off the path you say and when you
01:53:27.32 --> 01:53:33.16 feel like crap because you're off the program and the fact that you're off the program aside from just
01:53:33.16 --> 01:53:38.04 your physical physicality you feel like crap so you got to alleviate that feeling so you go to
01:53:38.04 --> 01:53:42.68 something that's gonna give you pleasure but forget what wrong pleasure you and short term when you
01:53:42.68 --> 01:53:48.12 need it long term you know so that's what you do that is a good a good thing I do that when
01:53:48.12 --> 01:53:55.08 let's say don't feel I've been traveling been eating crap the way to get back on
01:53:55.80 --> 01:54:01.56 the way to feel good again is just to hit yourself I mean get some screw get some do good
01:54:01.56 --> 01:54:08.04 can have a good couple base like uh you know in the in the field menu I've got these various
01:54:08.04 --> 01:54:16.04 workouts and there's some of those in there that are just core not core as an abs because we call it
01:54:16.04 --> 01:54:23.64 but but core programs that are fundamental yeah and I kind of know where I'm at on them and even
01:54:23.64 --> 01:54:29.88 if I'm not gonna go in there do a record performance it'll put me back on track it'll make it'll
01:54:29.88 --> 01:54:38.60 it'll clean my system mentally and physically yeah and that's good probably stick to this thing where
01:54:39.80 --> 01:54:44.68 you know if you're you have a girlfriend you get in a fight or something like that or they break
01:54:44.68 --> 01:54:49.32 up with you whatever you know something that makes you in a bad mood for whatever it's in
01:54:49.32 --> 01:54:54.84 they should go to the gym and do like shoulders or chest workouts something that would give like a
01:54:54.84 --> 01:55:00.68 really really hard painful pump you know that kind like I don't know 12 15 reps like a minute in
01:55:00.68 --> 01:55:06.76 between like eight sets of those massively pumped for some reason I just feel way better that's the
01:55:06.76 --> 01:55:13.64 same thing that's what I'm talking about yeah the way if you can give yourself for me you got your
01:55:13.64 --> 01:55:17.96 you got some workouts that are just fundamental I don't know what there's their probably a name for like
01:55:17.96 --> 01:55:24.20 medicine yeah medicine yeah medicine some medicine workouts you got to have some of those medicine
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:30.68 workouts that just put you back on the path yeah and then you know what do you fast 24 hours
01:55:31.40 --> 01:55:37.56 that's bold right there yeah 24 hours you feel you feel good I'm telling you feel good
01:55:38.28 --> 01:55:43.56 yeah I'll do like 15 now actually pretty often too and you're right strangely you're right
01:55:43.56 --> 01:55:51.96 I just read another article some of the pages I read two articles because people people tweet
01:55:51.96 --> 01:55:56.28 them to me yeah one of them was about the intermittent fasting we guess what it's good for you
01:55:57.48 --> 01:56:04.28 and then the other one was about this whole depletion of will is I'll not true yeah well the I think
01:56:04.28 --> 01:56:09.24 why I was right the scientists were wrong what they were saying I think with what you're saying
01:56:09.24 --> 01:56:13.56 I think there's like a slide no no no no no no so you're saying it's straight up wrong what
01:56:13.56 --> 01:56:19.96 there's no no there's I just read an article today that is wrong that this idea of the depletion
01:56:19.96 --> 01:56:28.12 of you know if you if you have to resist this chocolate chip cookie then within 20 minutes you won't
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:31.96 be able to resist the cake because you just can't resist that much yeah it's a lie it's then
01:56:31.96 --> 01:56:37.80 there's proving now that it's not true yeah not true yeah I feel like that's a psychological
01:56:37.80 --> 01:56:43.08 state so I might vary from individual but what I'm saying is if you if you're on the program
01:56:43.08 --> 01:56:49.80 yeah and you had some medicine in the morning you I'm telling you that it's easier to hold the
01:56:49.80 --> 01:56:54.92 line the more you hold the line it easier is to hold the line that's true yeah that's the truth
01:56:55.72 --> 01:57:01.88 you get some speaking of holding the holding the line and the truth by the way
01:57:01.88 --> 01:57:11.48 chocolate some supplements jocos supplements cruel oil the main one and joint warfare so
01:57:11.48 --> 01:57:21.24 joint warfare glucosamine and conjroitin and curcumin which is the other there's it's not just glucosamine
01:57:21.24 --> 01:57:27.72 and conjroitin yeah this curcumin yes what is that it's more goodness for the joints
01:57:27.72 --> 01:57:36.60 some stuff to wage warfare against joint inflammation pain yeah so and that's a big deal
01:57:36.60 --> 01:57:41.40 because again I'm gonna say I said it before but I think this is critical I mean you know I'm sure
01:57:41.40 --> 01:57:46.68 there's like supplements that help you build your muscles if you're into building my I'm sure
01:57:46.68 --> 01:57:56.20 there is but really if you can maintain your joints especially if you're due to pushing weights any kind
01:57:56.20 --> 01:58:02.84 of like so I like know that dynamic movement yeah you know because you joints take those that
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:06.84 that front and they degenerate over time oh they do because that would tap me to you
01:58:06.84 --> 01:58:11.80 I'm over here not degenerating I'm on joint warfare you're in a state of generating huh yeah
01:58:11.80 --> 01:58:18.52 I don't know I dig it and this is one of the cruel oil thing I'm not embarrassed because it's kind of
01:58:18.52 --> 01:58:23.40 funny story I might spend some little bit it's not funny funny but it is that I was like
01:58:23.40 --> 01:58:31.64 a girl oh oh to my father and yeah I'm like over here pushing cruel oil like in life I mean you know
01:58:32.36 --> 01:58:37.48 Brian his name is Brian and remember we went to the retreat in Maine from Brian the black belt
01:58:37.48 --> 01:58:43.88 they came I knew him sure so I kind of keep contact with him he's like hey do you have any like
01:58:43.88 --> 01:58:48.44 what's the cool supplements or whatever I was like right you know and I sent him some mine and he was
01:58:48.44 --> 01:58:53.08 I didn't get the report back down like the other day but nonetheless in life I'm straight up pushing
01:58:53.08 --> 01:58:57.48 it like you tell Greg about it all the time I don't think I don't think he'll maybe I get him son
01:58:57.48 --> 01:59:01.000 I don't know but it's like you know look and you get benefits for something yeah and then you're
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.56 like pushing it on other people some people do it with um bro goddingly
01:59:07.88 --> 01:59:16.20 Pikachu sure just various things you know books music why do we do that with music like if you
01:59:16.20 --> 01:59:20.68 you don't like my you know like I'll be like hey listen to this song it's the best song and then
01:59:20.68 --> 01:59:24.60 like you don't like it and I'm actually mad at you or you're mad at me because you don't like it
01:59:24.60 --> 01:59:28.44 yeah because I just don't like your music and I know grab well I think we kind of
01:59:28.44 --> 01:59:33.48 created to our identity in a way this kind of what I do with cruel oil part of my identity
01:59:33.48 --> 01:59:39.72 you know it's part of my joints identity I can tell you that and joint warfare good ones also
01:59:39.72 --> 01:59:45.16 await I didn't tell you where you can get this joint warfare and super cruel
01:59:45.16 --> 01:59:51.000 origin main dot com click on the top of the labs actually it's on the front page too it's on
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.48 jockel store too by the way jockel store dot com but yeah this is where you can get it if you want it

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.40 three pills and of course even six you take the three like dang only have three left I got to take
02:00:13.40 --> 02:00:17.96 this tomorrow yeah after tomorrow you know two-day shipping unless you got overnight shipping
02:00:17.96 --> 02:00:23.000 situation yeah there's just you don't want to do that to yourself no you don't you actually
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:31.08 for real don't you get that going on yes good idea thank you jocco and Pete also there's some good
02:00:31.08 --> 02:00:38.76 geese on there jocco is a geek jocco is a rashguard we'll start with that american hands I've worn it
02:00:38.76 --> 02:00:49.64 many times can I talk about 19% improvement in performance I got tapped out by Andy so so far no
02:00:50.84 --> 02:00:57.72 got tapped out by you too maybe we're still out of no any different the normal right yeah so
02:00:57.72 --> 02:01:02.76 so but but did I could I could have resist 19 I'm just saying the juice do out I can't come
02:01:02.76 --> 02:01:11.40 from really yeah but but if you remember because you remember I was wearing one of our rashguards
02:01:12.44 --> 02:01:21.000 small action big green yeah and I kind of got got after the right and so really in theory you're
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.88 19 plus and mining 19 plus kind of cancelled itself okay really but I felt like maybe if you got 19
02:01:27.88 --> 02:01:35.56 I felt like that day I had like 20% you're bringing it like yeah 26 because you weren't
02:01:35.56 --> 02:01:39.88 typically don't wear that right you don't really wear a rashguards you're much you weren't happy
02:01:39.88 --> 02:01:47.08 on the final guillotine no I think it was a coper you literally said I saw that coming yeah
02:01:48.28 --> 02:01:54.36 and that was one of those comments that was meant to kind of deflate my victory
02:01:54.36 --> 02:02:01.32 you know like you saw it coming and it was so obvious and it was just like you I just got lucky
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:06.84 and blah blah and I just I just said yeah definitely I'm really telegram about what I didn't say
02:02:06.84 --> 02:02:10.68 you got I can't believe how pathetic it was yeah this and you I mean to give you a breakdown
02:02:10.68 --> 02:02:16.04 of your guillotine your guillotine cobra which I think is even more so than the guillotine
02:02:17.32 --> 02:02:21.80 like you have such a good way to like get it you're one of those guys that like you're probably
02:02:21.80 --> 02:02:25.24 walking like right now you're thinking about guillotine right now that's what I think that's what
02:02:25.24 --> 02:02:31.16 it feels a lot so it's like when you go for it it just lands perfectly it's not the kind where you
02:02:31.16 --> 02:02:38.52 know oh no just grab it no no no no just so it's gotten to the point over literally like what
02:02:39.40 --> 02:02:44.92 like almost a decade of training with you and that thing getting sunk in that efficiently on
02:02:44.92 --> 02:02:53.80 my own name you're not that far from the truth it's like my body like knows like hey we've been
02:02:53.80 --> 02:02:58.20 here before this one my brain is almost like I can feel my brain as a separate entity tell
02:02:58.20 --> 02:03:04.28 my body sometimes if I get you in a guillotine and you go crazy trying to defend it and then like
02:03:04.28 --> 02:03:09.56 and you'll get out and the next one I'll be like yeah it's going down yeah it's like man I don't
02:03:09.56 --> 02:03:13.96 want that beef again because what what I what I had to do to get out of that first one is like
02:03:13.96 --> 02:03:19.32 bro I can't do something about it yeah it's not worth it that's exactly what it is and I think
02:03:19.88 --> 02:03:25.000 that's how my whole body reacts when I feel it gets sunk in it's kind of common man this again
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:30.04 we've been down this road same outcome you know my body is used to that outcome so it just kind of
02:03:30.04 --> 02:03:34.36 accommodates it that's what it feels like and I think that's part of what I meant but it's like I
02:03:34.36 --> 02:03:39.16 saw that coming I think your body is okay with me getting you I think so too I don't like the fact
02:03:39.16 --> 02:03:46.92 that it's like that I don't like I think I think talking about it might help or it might
02:03:46.92 --> 02:03:53.56 straight up not yeah rash guards geese made in America which is awesome so that's awesome
02:03:54.12 --> 02:03:58.68 yeah everyone should know that and they make them like make them yes yes they don't like
02:03:58.68 --> 02:04:04.92 shipping some stuff and then hey guys okay are we starting to make yeah even though it's been you know
02:04:04.92 --> 02:04:11.56 yeah they make or make it from the thread and the ghee the ghee is good that's the video's coming out
02:04:11.56 --> 02:04:18.76 yeah it's out the origin that's out the video Megan like I'm making confused with the
02:04:19.48 --> 02:04:25.32 Amanda by the way hold on story I won't go into it right now nonetheless videos out
02:04:25.96 --> 02:04:31.48 making made the video it's a good one actually you kind of made the video to you right now what
02:04:31.48 --> 02:04:39.72 listen they make anything nonetheless joccus geese out other geese on origin all good I got two
02:04:39.72 --> 02:04:45.56 other ones so three origin geese all together me it's only geese all everywhere I think
02:04:47.08 --> 02:04:52.28 unless someone else can make their own material in America and you know provide the same
02:04:52.28 --> 02:04:57.24 everything then hey maybe maybe not but just saying as of right now that's how it is also
02:04:57.24 --> 02:05:04.76 no kettlebells right I'm gonna keep you updated on my kettlebell situation I'm addicted to
02:05:04.76 --> 02:05:09.80 I'm addicted to them collecting and doing them so I got one more that's the Cyclops from on it
02:05:11.16 --> 02:05:17.40 the designer one no no what do you call it the regulation regular ones none of those anyway Cyclops
02:05:17.40 --> 02:05:23.16 I think is 40 something pounds I only got one I'm getting out of joke with that one too anyway
02:05:23.16 --> 02:05:31.08 the good thing about these is they are balanced because a lot of times and from what I here I
02:05:31.08 --> 02:05:34.84 don't know but from what I hear like a lot of the design ones they're not balanced
02:05:35.40 --> 02:05:43.000 you know these are balanced and that's the ones I use and I'm addicted to the workout
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.40 starts low with these when you do it though are you still doing a lot of kettlebells yeah I do
02:05:47.40 --> 02:05:51.96 decent amount of kettlebells yeah doing some Turkish get-ups the other day yeah right I didn't get that
02:05:51.96 --> 02:05:59.48 I thought I was gonna get really into Turkish get-ups but I did a few times and just you didn't it didn't stick you
02:05:59.48 --> 02:06:04.52 know you know you know understand stuff just sticks even though it's cool you know what it was I did it
02:06:04.52 --> 02:06:09.96 with the 35 pound one then I did it with the 54 pound one and I was like 10 this is a good exercise
02:06:09.96 --> 02:06:13.64 hard and then I went online to look up exercises and then there's ones with guys doing it with
02:06:13.64 --> 02:06:20.36 185 pounds like doing it and maybe maybe I just got discouraged I got encouraged do I see that oh yeah
02:06:20.36 --> 02:06:25.000 you take it it's like a challenge yeah yeah maybe my whole outlook is different
02:06:25.96 --> 02:06:31.88 anyway when you do these kettlebells if you want the cool ones to me kettlebells or dope but if you
02:06:31.88 --> 02:06:37.24 want them extra dope you go to on it dot com slash jockel get your kettlebells there just look at them
02:06:38.20 --> 02:06:44.44 they got light ones everyone's I say start light but hey whatever your level is you know get them
02:06:44.44 --> 02:06:56.12 also when you get your copy of what is the the translated hundred rules of war yes we get this again
02:06:56.12 --> 02:07:02.60 yeah which I'm pronouncing it all sorry yeah see and that's really great and okay so I put these
02:07:02.60 --> 02:07:06.92 books all these books if you didn't already I'm going to say again I put all the books on our website
02:07:06.92 --> 02:07:12.20 jockepotcast.com and this is for this very reason jockeot has no how to pronounce some of this stuff
02:07:12.20 --> 02:07:18.04 no especially the Japanese stuff you know you come to me for help I help it's not a smooth
02:07:18.04 --> 02:07:23.000 process is what I'm saying so I tried to smooth out a little bit jockepotcast.com on the
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.16 tops his books from the episode click on there look this episode what one a one boom from episode
02:07:29.16 --> 02:07:35.32 one a one a hundred rules of war even though there's only ninety seven of them and if you want to

02:07:42.12 --> 02:07:50.44 a book that is completely off of what we would normally talk about yeah like for like what I don't
02:07:50.44 --> 02:07:57.16 know something that's not about war the lion the witch in the wardrobe yeah if you go to buy that book
02:07:58.52 --> 02:08:03.24 you can just click it's still supports the podcast doesn't have to be the but when you buy it yeah

02:08:23.40 --> 02:08:28.84 so on the website jockepotcast.com good way to support also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't
02:08:28.84 --> 02:08:35.48 already on iTunes to just stitch your google play Spotify is that a
02:08:35.48 --> 02:08:39.88 no I don't you spot a fact Spotify is not you can't get I don't I don't think you can get it
02:08:39.88 --> 02:08:44.60 but there's a bunch any podcasting platform I don't think Spotify is one of them we had a request
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:49.64 for Spotify because then you could play it on Alexa but I can you can play it on Alexa right now
02:08:49.64 --> 02:08:55.64 you can say Alexa play the latest jockel podcast actually in not to split here is what it's
02:08:55.64 --> 02:09:02.28 called amazon echo Alexa's just the name you say yeah but Alexa's what you say yeah so that's what I said
02:09:02.28 --> 02:09:10.28 no you said you can get it on Alexa oh okay technically on the difference I just want us to go in
02:09:10.28 --> 02:09:16.92 correct and insane and doing the right thing that's all nonetheless subscribe if you haven't already
02:09:16.92 --> 02:09:22.12 is it's supposed to put it this way I'm not saying subscribe I'm saying subscribing is a good way to support
02:09:22.68 --> 02:09:28.20 also on youtube subscribe to the youtube channel put some videos on there excerpts not as many excerpts as
02:09:28.20 --> 02:09:34.76 I did last week this week because I got I learned this new video thing we talked about earlier I won't
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:43.64 go into it but I want it's really technical but I wound up getting obsessed with it so like for
02:09:43.64 --> 02:09:48.52 I think it was like 11 hours a day for three days I'm making this clip that's like three seconds long
02:09:48.52 --> 02:09:55.32 today so I didn't get to the excerpts is what I'm saying but as a result I think there's I think
02:09:55.32 --> 02:10:00.76 the next video that it releases gonna have some new things to it might be something that only I'm noticing
02:10:00.76 --> 02:10:07.32 maybe maybe not but nonetheless that's gonna be how it is either way point there is subscribe to youtube
02:10:08.04 --> 02:10:16.68 it's a good way to support yeah I want to do a youtube live figure how to do that
02:10:17.40 --> 02:10:23.40 yeah that's not that hard so let's do it just a youtube live random yeah like a facebook live
02:10:23.40 --> 02:10:27.88 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because I think it'd be cool to be stored on youtube instead of
02:10:27.88 --> 02:10:33.24 stored on facebook right yeah I think it's just the matter of it's it doesn't matter ultimately it's
02:10:33.24 --> 02:10:39.80 just a video yeah but if it's if it's stored on on youtube people can go back and be reading it
02:10:39.80 --> 02:10:45.08 and whatever and well I started watching it if it's on facebook it's way buried in some random
02:10:45.08 --> 02:10:50.68 yeah yeah yeah your your feet yeah what do you call it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah time line whatever
02:10:50.68 --> 02:10:59.64 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah nonetheless youtube does it good on to subscribe
02:10:59.64 --> 02:11:04.28 got some other videos aside from just the video version of this podcast that's the good that's the
02:11:04.28 --> 02:11:08.60 main reason I think to subscribe if you're interested in that kind of stuff and you can sign
02:11:08.60 --> 02:11:13.16 you know you can get a notification if you don't you don't need it but you can go on also
02:11:13.16 --> 02:11:20.52 joc was a store it's called jocl store jocl store dot com got some new stuff under straight up
02:11:21.72 --> 02:11:27.72 rash guards who these are up I know I've been saying it but they're up though is one of my
02:11:27.72 --> 02:11:36.20 hats got some hats I am putting beanies on there oh yes that's good yes yeah okay I hope
02:11:36.20 --> 02:11:43.000 they're thick beanies they're regular I didn't know there's nothing I've been you know doing some
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.84 research this is a good beany okay from all I kind of extrapolated all the you know they advice
02:11:49.48 --> 02:11:55.16 online and these are the good ones also some new rash guards k the new rashguard is
02:11:57.64 --> 02:12:02.20 a rashguard that says small action on one side big reaction on the other side
02:12:02.20 --> 02:12:11.88 when I work for the first time a healing tailor said he didn't know he didn't know the layers
02:12:12.28 --> 02:12:18.36 but he saw it and he was like the essence of jiu jitsu because it is right just my action
02:12:18.36 --> 02:12:24.28 big reactions what we're hoping for yeah it's just in killing jiu dokeling yeah he knew he knows about the
02:12:24.28 --> 02:12:32.84 way also some women stuff on there which is cool I think some patches on there sure it's I'm
02:12:32.84 --> 02:12:37.56 gonna have a new shirt coming out I don't have a new shirt you have a new shirt coming out
02:12:38.44 --> 02:12:44.76 do I know what it is nope interesting not yet a lot of times I'll get input from the online
02:12:44.76 --> 02:12:49.96 people from the people and I kind of you know every most of the time it's like one off things you
02:12:49.96 --> 02:12:54.52 know like oh I heard jocos say this one thing this is one time back then I really liked it
02:12:54.52 --> 02:12:58.52 we would make a great shirt kind of thing and I'm although they're usually right a lot of times
02:12:58.52 --> 02:13:03.32 and they can maybe that might not translate into your real picky and choosey is what I'm here
02:13:03.32 --> 02:13:08.20 yeah put it this way a lot of people after hitting me with it okay and this is one of those
02:13:08.20 --> 02:13:14.12 I have actually mentioned it before it's called back to the book I think it's coming out good
02:13:14.12 --> 02:13:21.72 anyway that one's coming out to jocob store jocob store dot com take a look at this stuff on there
02:13:21.72 --> 02:13:27.72 if you see something you like get something also psychological warfare on all of our this
02:13:27.72 --> 02:13:34.44 is what psychological warfare is on all of our journeys I'm going back to journeys
02:13:36.04 --> 02:13:39.32 someone requested something the other day and it was actually better than campaign or journey
02:13:39.32 --> 02:13:44.20 but I forget what it was so it's better just not that much better no it's better but I can't remember
02:13:44.20 --> 02:13:51.08 I see a lot of stuff that's true you do see a lot of stuff well on our campaign against weakness journey
02:13:51.96 --> 02:13:58.36 everyone's while we're running to roadblocks points of weakness hopefully less than more
02:13:58.36 --> 02:14:02.36 more times than not we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't we don't
02:14:02.36 --> 02:14:11.56 very clear hopefully not very often but one the unfricquint time comes where you run into those
02:14:11.56 --> 02:14:17.88 weaknesses you said unfricquint time but it's cool we know what you mean bro the not frequent
02:14:17.88 --> 02:14:24.28 yeah the rare time that you run into weaknesses do not worry because psychological warfare is an
02:14:24.28 --> 02:14:29.56 album with tracks that helps you right through that most situations pretty much all situations really
02:14:29.56 --> 02:14:36.60 weak and up early skipping workouts procrastination staying on the program diet why is all this
02:14:36.60 --> 02:14:41.72 stuff a lot of stuff a bunch of tracks on there and it's jockel telling you pragmatically ways that you can
02:14:42.28 --> 02:14:48.76 practice with practical right practical meaning you can practice these things it's not just some
02:14:48.76 --> 02:14:56.68 philosophical slash inspirational stuff I would say do yeah it's more due practical it's kind of the
02:14:56.68 --> 02:15:03.72 teamwork for it but nonetheless practical advice coming directly from jockel directly into your ear
02:15:03.72 --> 02:15:09.000 on why you shouldn't give in to these weaknesses it's like a little spot in your campaign that's
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:14.04 what psychological warfare is it's a good one it's a real good one another's that is a number one
02:15:14.04 --> 02:15:19.96 spoken word albums on iTunes for about nine months and they finally got beaten out by another album
02:15:19.96 --> 02:15:28.68 it was read on field manual which is people keep asking me it's available as an album with
