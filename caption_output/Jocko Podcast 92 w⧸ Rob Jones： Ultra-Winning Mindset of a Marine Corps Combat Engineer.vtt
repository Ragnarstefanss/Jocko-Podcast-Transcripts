00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 92 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening, echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The concept of finding an IED is relatively simple.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It is essentially identifying what doesn't belong in the natural area in front of you.

5
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Before one proceeds, however, one must ensure that all of the Marines with them are at a safe distance,

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
such that if the searcher unintentionally detonates an IED during his investigation,

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the Marines he is with will not be harmed.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The first step is to take a good look at where you are and where you plan to go.

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Identify anything that looks out of the ordinary with respect to nature.

10
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The world naturally doesn't often have patterns or perfect shapes.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Essentially, you are looking for areas where you suspect man has been in contact with nature.

12
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When one patrols in the same area frequently, one can establish a baseline observation for what to look for,

13
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and what the area looks like normally.

14
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Thus, on subsequent visits, it is possible to identify elements that are out of place.

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The next step is to investigate the route that you have chosen through this danger area.

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The three main tools used for this investigation are the eyeballs, a metal detector,

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and a cutting edge digging device called the human hand.

18
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Proceeding slowly in a forward direction, one swings the metal detector in a fashion that covers every square inch of the chosen route.

19
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
In order to do this, start with a metal detector to one side of the route,

20
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and move it straight across to the other side, keeping the search head and inch or two above,

21
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and parallel to the ground.

22
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Once it is across, move the detector forward, half the length of the search head,

23
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and swing it in the opposite direction to the original side of the route.

24
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This is a process that continues for the entirety of your time moving through the danger area.

25
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
At some point during your movement along this route,

26
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
you will want to investigate certain spots that you think may contain an IED.

27
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You can be alerted to these spots in multiple ways.

28
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
From your early assessment, before proceeding through the area,

29
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
newly acquired suspicions as you move through the area,

30
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and also from sounds that your metal detector makes.

31
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The process of swing the metal detector back and forth and inching forward is time consuming.

32
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The best of the best are the ones that can optimize safety and keep time spent to a minimum.

33
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It is always better, however, to err on the side of caution,

34
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
except in the most extreme of emergencies.

35
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The investigation of a suspicious area must proceed with extreme caution.

36
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You start by kneeling down, being sure to be well balanced and stable.

37
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You must ensure that no gear is going to accidentally fall off or slip out and touch the ground.

38
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You reach out with your fingers,

39
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and with the gentleness of a butterfly landing on a daisy,

40
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
move the dirt in front of the front edge of the metal hit.

41
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Proceed forward, a nanometer at a time in this fashion,

42
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
uncovering more dirt over a wider space until you find the metal that's set off the detector,

43
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
or you are satisfied that there is no danger from this particular metal hit.

44
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
If metal is found, the area must be rechecked to ensure that the metal was found was not a decoy.

45
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
One may think that the tension during this time is akin to being Tom Cruise dangling inches above a motion sensor floor,

46
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but the necessity of having a clear mind and the amount of practice that has gone into this exact process makes it seem second nature and ordinary.

47
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
After you are satisfied that you have cleared this suspicious area, proceed forward.

48
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
As you move forward, you are also proofing the lane.

49
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That thing, proofing the lane, or confirming that it is free from IEDs, is usually done with a special mechanical device,

50
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but it is now being done with your feet.

51
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And don't forget as you go forward to lay down markers for everyone else who comes behind you to follow.

52
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This is the way that I handled the situation I was now in.

53
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I inched forward with my metal detector.

54
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I didn't see anything special about the area.

55
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
My metal detector was making noises, but nothing large enough that I thought it warranted an investigation.

56
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The Marines in our patrol watched and waited as I cleared and proved the lane.

57
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Then it all went black.

58
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Now, that description is about as good as I have read about the act of searching for IEDs.

59
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And I actually never searched for IEDs in that type of method.

60
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And of course in Ramadi, everyone was always searching for IEDs.

61
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You were always looking, you were inspecting.

62
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We were suspicious of every pile of rubble, every piece of junk on the road, every off-colored piece of dirt,

63
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
or pavement, or concrete, or sand.

64
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But we were in this city.

65
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And there was pedestrian traffic.

66
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And most of the IEDs were targeting vehicles, not foot patrols.

67
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But whether in a vehicle or on foot, the IED for the most part has been the biggest threat and the biggest cause of casualties in our recent wars.

68
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And for the enemy, it's a low-risk, high-reward weapon.

69
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And for us, it's an evil weapon.

70
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's a cowardly weapon, and it is an effective weapon.

71
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's a weapon that plants itself in your mind.

72
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Always there.

73
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Waiting.

74
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Around that corner.

75
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Under that curb, on the other side of that sidewalk.

76
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's waiting.

77
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Now, there are those who's job, it is, to actually interject that weapon, the IED.

78
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It is their job to face that fear up close and personal day in and day out.

79
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You've got EOD explosive ordinance, disposal is one group that does it complete professionals.

80
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And the EOD technicians that I deployed within the SEAL teams were just outstanding and everything that they did, which by the way, was not only find and disarm IEDs.

81
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They also did everything that we did.

82
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They cleared rooms and patrolled through the streets and maneuvered in fire flights just as the SEALs did.

83
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And in addition to EOD combat engineers in the Army and in the Marine Corps also do mind clearance.

84
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And of course, I talk about combat engineers a lot because of the incredible role that they played in the battle of the body and the combat engineers were outstanding in their standard job of building combat engineers.

85
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And they're standard job of building combat outposts and building and maintaining the infrastructure of the bases.

86
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And they were awesome in that performance, under fire.

87
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But at some point, the combat engineers job morphed into mind clearance.

88
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It's because I would suspect, you know, they work with demolitions.

89
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, so combat engineers do breaches to doors and to walls.

90
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They build bridges and bridges and they also clear obstacles from roads and bridges.

91
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And so eventually, at some point, this morphed into combat engineers doing IED clearance both on roads and then out on foot patrols.

92
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Now, there's jobs in the world that I wouldn't want to do.

93
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And this is one of them.

94
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
It takes a massive amount of patience.

95
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
It takes an incredible amount of skill and it takes an incredible ability to overcome fear.

96
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:16.000
If you're going to actually seek out and touch the thing, the very thing that is trying to kill you in order to stop it,

97
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that's a job that I didn't want then.

98
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I don't want now.

99
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And I am thankful that there was others that stepped up and did that job.

100
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And I'm honored to have on the podcasts tonight.

101
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:45.000
One of those brave men, a Marine Corps combat engineer who served in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

102
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And the guy, by the way, who wrote that opening description of what it was like to go out and hunt for IEDs.

103
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I'm glad by the name of Mr. Rob Jones. Rob, welcome to the show.

104
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This isn't, this is an honor for me to be. I just really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to come on the show.

105
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I'll man trust me that the honors all ours, a thousand percent. You can't even argue with that point.

106
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, let it happen.

107
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Give us just before we jump into your Marine Corps career, just give us a little pre Marine Corps background on growing up and what that where that was and what it was like.

108
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Can I answer your question about how a combat engineer came to find IEDs?

109
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Yeah, please do.

110
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So when you go to combat engineer school, one of the things they teach you is mind-field,

111
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and defeat, and to do that, you use mind detectors and metal detectors. So I think that's the main reason that it, I wonder at what point you think that came from World War II?

112
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I don't know. That's a good question.

113
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Because yeah, when I said it morphed into, I was thinking like back, you know, must have been sometime in World War II where they said, you know, okay, we're going to get over this river.

114
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Okay, so a common engineer is going to get over the river. We're going to secure this compound. Okay, we're going to secure the compound.

115
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We're going to rebuild this compound. Okay, well at some point they said, you know what, what if there's mines there?

116
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Okay, well we got to get them cleared out. So at some point they realize that you can't build if you can't clear, right?

117
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And you can't move if you can't clear.

118
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So somebody's got to do it.

119
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Yeah, somebody's got to do it.

120
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And they weren't able to slough off that job on somebody else, which is what I would have been trying to do.

121
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Like, can we get somebody else to do that job?

122
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Yeah, so that's good. So how did you end up with the Marine Corps?

123
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Oh, yeah, my background grew up in a farm.

124
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Nothing really special about my upbringing.

125
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Kind of farm.

126
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
That was a horse farm.

127
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I hated horses because I was a depicker.

128
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
What is that?

129
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What do you do? What is the purpose of a horse farm?

130
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000
The farm that I grew up on, the purpose of it was my parents would take people on horseback riding trips.

131
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Okay.

132
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
They would pay them money and they'd take them out for a couple hours in the forest.

133
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Got it. Got it.

134
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And so was my duty to clean up after the horses.

135
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Feed the horses.

136
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Stack their hay bales in the summertime. Get them their water.

137
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So I didn't really enjoy the horses as much as most people would.

138
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But, you know, I'm thankful that I had that experience because I think it did instill me a work ethic that doesn't.

139
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
That a lot of people don't get.

140
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Yeah.

141
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So I think when you come from, because you know, a lot of guys when they come in the military,

142
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
they've never worked hard before.

143
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
But the guys I've met in the military that came from some kind of a farming background.

144
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
They're like, hey, I'm so happy here.

145
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I'm about up at three o'clock in the morning.

146
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You know, milk and cows or whatever, or cleaning up a horseshit in your case.

147
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
No man. The number of times I had to wield this wheelbarrow full of manure up a fence board onto this big pile.

148
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And the times I fell off that thing.

149
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Every time I just curse those horses I hate and I hate much.

150
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Now I like horses finds.

151
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
You've got over your horse PTSD if you go out.

152
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So I think what you graduated from high school and then you went to college, right?

153
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Yeah, I went to Virginia Tech.

154
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I was actually a computer science major.

155
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'm already suspect.

156
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I'm impressed.

157
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I'm impressed.

158
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I'm suspect.

159
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So at some point during that during my college career, my sophomore year, I decided that computer science was not for me.

160
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
How do you feel now, Aga?

161
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That's right.

162
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Be trained.

163
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And I decided.

164
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I don't know.

165
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I felt like I had spent the first 20 years of my life kind of looking after myself.

166
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And now I needed to do something that was beyond my own self interest.

167
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And a buddy of mine had just joined the Marine Corps.

168
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So I read a couple books about the Marine Corps, Brotherhood of Heroes, about the Battle of Pale Aleu.

169
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And I said, yep, that's what I want to do.

170
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I want to join the Marine Corps.

171
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So before telling my parents before telling anybody, looked up where the recruiter was, went down there.

172
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
He wasn't there.

173
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Marine Corps recruiter wasn't there.

174
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Air Force recruiter tells me to come in his office and tells me about the Air Force.

175
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I said, yeah, just tell me when the Marine Corps recruiter's back there.

176
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Nothing against the Air Force, but I had already decided on Marine Corps.

177
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And so I joined up.

178
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I think it's, I, this may be right around.

179
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I'm pretty sure it's right.

180
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
The Marine Corps has like the lowest recruiting budget.

181
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And they have the highest recruiting numbers because it's the Marine Corps.

182
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Yeah.

183
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
It's just their, their approach, I guess.

184
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Yeah.

185
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Like, oh, you want to be one of us, right?

186
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Maybe.

187
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Yeah.

188
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
To see if you can.

189
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yeah.

190
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yeah.

191
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So I joined up as a reserveist.

192
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
My original plan, because I was after my junior year.

193
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So I wanted to finish college at least.

194
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So my original plan was I did the 92 day reserveist program where I went to boot camp after my junior year.

195
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Then I finished my last year of college.

196
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And then I went to job school and MCT.

197
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000
How did your academic performance change or did it between pre boot camp and post boot camp?

198
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
It didn't a whole lot.

199
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Because I think I kind of checked out a college after my junior year.

200
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I was like, I just want to go to boy, but I just kind of want to get this degree done.

201
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Mm-hmm.

202
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
I just so I have it.

203
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Um, now after I deployed a few a couple times and had a little bit more life experience.

204
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
There probably be a lot different.

205
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Mm-hmm.

206
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
But just those three months of boot camp didn't really change my.

207
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Your academic approach.

208
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
I was plenty.

209
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Spire.

210
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I was smart enough.

211
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I just didn't care that much about it anymore.

212
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Yeah.

213
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So my original plan was to do that.

214
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And then have the a little bit of experience as an enlisting guy.

215
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Mm-hmm.

216
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And then he used my degree to become an officer.

217
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Mm-hmm.

218
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But when I was in engineer school after that second summer,

219
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
my company, my reserve company, said,

220
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
we're sending a volunteer platoon to Iraq.

221
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Mm-hmm.

222
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
So I said, well, that's the whole reason I joined up was to go fight the war.

223
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So screw me at an officer.

224
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I'm going to deploy.

225
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And so then we go to my first deployment.

226
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:45.000
So I thought it was pretty, you got a good note in here about the Marine Corps.

227
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And I'm just going to read this.

228
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I'm taking this stuff from your journal that you have online, which is awesome read.

229
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So here we go.

230
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Back to the journal.

231
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
The Marine Corps began to shape me long before I ever arrived at Boot Camp in Paris,

232
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Island, South Carolina.

233
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
It started when I read the book, Brotherhood of Heroes,

234
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
the Tale of the Battle of Pelu, in World War II.

235
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
It was through the stories of the Marines told in those pages that I was introduced to the courage,

236
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:27.000
spirit, tenacity, altruism, and Brotherhood that the Marines possess qualities that I would soon be ingrained with as well.

237
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
The basics of these qualities were taught to me and my fellow recruits in Boot Camp through rudimentary,

238
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
but effective means the proverbial stick.

239
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
It was through punishment that we were shown what it meant to possess the attributes of a Marine.

240
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Punishment would come in a variety of modes based on the same concept.

241
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Countless pushups, situps, sprinting, caring, and of course screaming.

242
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
The drill instructors would use any excuse, not that they needed one, to inflict pain upon us.

243
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Not being loud enough, looking in the wrong place, in perfection in uniform, dirty squad bay,

244
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
and not moving fast enough for their inspections to name a few.

245
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
The reality of the situation was that we were never loud enough, always looking in the wrong place,

246
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
never had perfect uniforms, the squad bay was always too dirty, and we were simply too slow.

247
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000
The idea wasn't simply to pointlessly inflict pain, but to teach lessons using the pain as the instructor.

248
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
It was to force us to make ourselves better so the whole platoon as a whole would be better.

249
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
The idea was to form a brotherhood through shared suffering and shared dependence.

250
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
It was to teach us to keep fighting the pain so that the platoon as a whole could stop being punished.

251
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
The point was that once we reached perfection, the requirements changed so that we were forced to constantly reach for it,

252
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
thus forcing us to become better than we ever knew we could be.

253
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
This is how the Marine Corps takes hungs of iron and turns them into jewel steel.

254
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000
That's why the Marine Corps doesn't need a lot of recruitment money.

255
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:27.000
But so true, and I like what you pointed out, the shared dependence and how when you're going through bootcamp scenarios

256
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
and training scenarios that are really hard, you realize you're not going to be able to do this alone.

257
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And you're going to have to rely on these other guys who you may not in the civilian world, you wouldn't have even been associated with.

258
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And now you're not only associated with them, you depend on them for your survival and to get through it.

259
00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And that's what makes that military experience and certainly the Marine Corps doesn't outstanding job of formulating that bond that is unique to the military.

260
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yeah, that's what, that's the thing that makes Marines what they are and brings out the best in people's when they're doing something not for their own self-interest, but for somebody else.

261
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And I would volunteer for the worst stuff so that I could prevent my buddies from having to do it like walking through the U.S. River, looking for whatever, trying to find weapons caches in Iraq.

262
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And then getting back at the end of the day just totally soaked and covered in trash water.

263
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And they come in and say we're doing it again, he wants to go and I'm like, yeah, I'll go again.

264
00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And that's why I really, I kind of enjoyed the Combinage in your role too because I'm going out there protecting people, protecting my buddies, protecting other Marines and taking the risk on me.

265
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
And I mean, that's what being a Marine is all about anybody else would have done it too.

266
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Yeah, so you go your first deployment to Iraq and what was that deployment like where'd you go?

267
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Uh, how about you? Over in poverty. And what, so this is 2008.

268
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So 2008? So things are pretty mellow at 2008.

269
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Yeah, Iraq kind of slowed down at that point wasn't much going on.

270
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:41.000
We had one tiny little incident where we were on a convoey and some guy and those were fired maybe 3 AK rounds and then ran away.

271
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And it was so, you know, nothing. And that was the first couple weeks.

272
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Yeah, I did miss it. I didn't miss it.

273
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And what was your response to the three rounds from the AK 47?

274
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I continued sitting in the back of the seven times.

275
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
You'd like an 18 year old Lance Corp. Reload with 700 rounds of 50 g.

276
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Or it was a long convoey. So it was way up there.

277
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And I was like, oh, I got to get out. I got to get up there.

278
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
But it was over before it was done.

279
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Did anyone shoot the issue back? Did they return fire at him?

280
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
No, I don't think so. I mean, he like, he did one of those things.

281
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
He raised over to the other.

282
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And then left. By the time anybody, we'll see it.

283
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
But to figure out where he was, he's gone.

284
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
So that was, but that was in the first couple weeks. So it was kind of off to a good start.

285
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And then nothing else happened really.

286
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
So what were you guys doing during that deployment?

287
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I guess it was kind of the, the build portion of the strategy at that point.

288
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
You know, we were, we were helping the local population build up their cities.

289
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:57.000
We were helping the build, uh, Iraqi police stations. And but what I spent most of my time doing was when we would go out and find buried weapons cash.

290
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
So just these old stores of RPGs and stuff that the al Qaeda used to be using.

291
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Right.

292
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
But they had just left there.

293
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And then so the local population would, or somebody would give us a tip.

294
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Right. And we would go out to this big field. And they'd say, yeah, supposedly somewhere in here, there's a weapons cash.

295
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000
So we take out our metal detectors and sweep every square inch of that field or hill or wherever we were tree tree line.

296
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
And until we either, to start determining those nothing, or we would find it and we dig it up and stack it.

297
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And then the idea would come and blow it up.

298
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And we, you attach to a, like, an combat engineer, platoon for, or we attach to an infantry platoon.

299
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Yes. The way it works for the, what we call a division side engineers, like, common engineer battalion is one common engineer platoon is attached to an infantry battalion.

300
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
And then you kind of break it down. So one squad of that platoon goes with each company.

301
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And then one team goes with the platoon. So you kind of help that platoon out. You're just pretty much attached to them the entire time.

302
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
So when you guys are being doing these Clarences of, like, of, let's say a big field.

303
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
It would be a, a, a Marine Corp platoon and you would be doing all all the sweeping.

304
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Yeah. So it would be a Marine Corp platoon or a squad.

305
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
It would be a squad. Okay. So it's in a little long.

306
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
But we'd go out on a squad patrol, patrol out there. They would set up security on the area and they would just wait.

307
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And then you'd be me and one other guy and we would sweep.

308
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And sometimes we would have one of the infantry guys have a, a, a, a tool.

309
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Mm-hmm. And we'd like to dig there. And you would dig and nothing else.

310
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And then when you, when you'd find casters, would you guys blow them in place or would you recover it?

311
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I guess it would depend. We would take pictures of what we found.

312
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
So we could write the report when we got back. And if it was out in the middle of nowhere,

313
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
a lot of the times they would, they would blow it in place. We have to wait for YOD.

314
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
They would let us do it.

315
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Uh, that's, that's actually really jacked up.

316
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
It's so soon.

317
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
That is so jacked up.

318
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Because there's only one EOD unit for the, like, four EOD guys for the entire battalion.

319
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
And not to mention that's the fun part.

320
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Exactly.

321
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Right.

322
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And I have, I, I know how to, they used, back in, like, 2005,

323
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
coming engineers and years were doing all that all the time.

324
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Just lay it out.

325
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
You just sympathetically detonated with the stick of C4.

326
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
It's all it is.

327
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
You know what this is? It's because the war had slowed down.

328
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Yeah.

329
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And then, it's all.

330
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
The war slows down.

331
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
All of a sudden people start putting the rules and regulations.

332
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And yeah, wait, no, we could have EOD that.

333
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
One of that same thing, we had the heaviest.

334
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I'm sure when you guys were in the, in the,

335
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
and the, the standard flag vest.

336
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Yeah.

337
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
We had this ridiculous,

338
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
turtle shell front sapies, backs,

339
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
apiece side sapies, neck protector, groin protector,

340
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
everything butt protector, like, it was just, the vest itself was 70 pounds.

341
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Let me tell you something interesting about that.

342
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
When we were in the body, not everyone had that.

343
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And everyone wanted it.

344
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And they did their best.

345
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
I remember actually, the kernel of the brigade coming down and bringing side

346
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
sapy plates down to combat outposts to hand them out to guys,

347
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
because everybody wanted them.

348
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
They wanted the neck protectors, the shoulder protectors,

349
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
the groin protectors, they wanted everything.

350
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Yeah.

351
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I mean, most, I'll, many guys just, hey, you know,

352
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
especially you're sitting in a turret,

353
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
or yeah, like load me up.

354
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I want all that, the neck, they wanted it all.

355
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Yeah.

356
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Because it was gnarly.

357
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Yeah. And then go, try and do a hit on a house with it.

358
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Yeah.

359
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
That part's not fun.

360
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
But so it's probably that same thing where they're just coming up with all the safety rules.

361
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And you have to have your helmet gloves, eye protection on it all times when you're outside the wire.

362
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
So for whatever reason, they didn't let us blow it up.

363
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
So we'd have to wait for EOD to come out.

364
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And then they would either blow it up there.

365
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
If it was on the middle of nowhere,

366
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
but if it was in the city, they would usually take it somewhere.

367
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
And, and meanwhile, the rest of the combination of your battalion are out there.

368
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Are out, do you help them with the building?

369
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
The structures, building schools, helping me infrastructure and stuff like that?

370
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
It would depend.

371
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Yeah. So whatever that platoon that they were attached to is doing.

372
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
They'd just be doing that.

373
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And then every now and then if they needed all of us back to build up in Iraqi police station,

374
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
they would call everybody in or everybody but a couple of guys in.

375
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And then we'd all go out of the platoon to build that.

376
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Got it.

377
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
But I spent most of my time just doing the cash sweeping and going on patrol.

378
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So within the platoon are certain people designated as like mine sweepers,

379
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
or does everyone get trained in?

380
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
No, everybody should be able to do it.

381
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Got it.

382
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
How come you kept getting the, because you volunteered for that?

383
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
You said, hey, I'll go find it.

384
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Yeah, I mean, and my,

385
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
fire team was, where my squad was kind of,

386
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
we didn't want to do the construction stuff because we thought it was boring.

387
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
I wasn't great.

388
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I could swing a hammer, but you know, I wasn't like good at it.

389
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And so we kind of tried to put ourselves in positions where we wouldn't have to go do that stuff.

390
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
We tried to always be out with the, with the squads, with the platoons,

391
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
as often as we could so we could avoid the construction stuff.

392
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
But then yeah, that's what I wanted it to be doing.

393
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah, be out on patrol.

394
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Yeah, exactly.

395
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
So that's, so then that deployment you come home,

396
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
and you had already graduated from college at this point, right?

397
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Yeah.

398
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
And so you come home, and then what happens when you get home?

399
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
So what's your plan when you get home?

400
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
When I get home.

401
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Well, so we were in Iraq and my buddy,

402
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Ronnie and Daniel, we were all drinking.

403
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
We were like, that was not what we wanted.

404
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
You know what, the good thing is when you're drinking,

405
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
that's when you make your best military decisions about what to do with your career.

406
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
But yeah.

407
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
We were sitting there going that was not what we were hoping it would be.

408
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
We wanted to do some fighting, do some killing.

409
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So we were like, we got to figure out a way to go to Afghanistan.

410
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
And so we started trying to look up, because we were in the reserve.

411
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
So sometimes there's, there's programs where you can be an augmentee,

412
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
an individual augmentee.

413
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Did you have a civilian job at this point?

414
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I didn't, because I'd just graduated college.

415
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
So you'd just graduated college, then you go on deployment,

416
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
then you come home, and now you're saying,

417
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
all right, what do I, how do I get back, how do I, how do I go fight?

418
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I had 25,000 bucks for deployment, so I bought a motorcycle, you know?

419
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Yep, another great decision in the middle.

420
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
That's good investment, good long-term investment.

421
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Yeah, the graph teacher.

422
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
But yeah, so I was looking for a job to tie me over.

423
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And trying everything I could to go to Afghanistan.

424
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
But luckily, it's pretty shortly after we got back,

425
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
we go to drill and company says, send volunteer between Afghanistan.

426
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
And, boom, right here, because, at Afghanistan,

427
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
was heating up at this time.

428
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Yeah.

429
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
If you remember, but we had still had to wait about eight or nine months before,

430
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
we went to the workup for that.

431
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
So I just took a job, put an out traffic counters,

432
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
like there's a little too, go across the road,

433
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
and you attach the electronic box to it.

434
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
So I just took a job doing that to,

435
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
sort of, like, related to IED, isn't it?

436
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
A little bit.

437
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
A bit on the side of the road.

438
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You don't crush wire on the road.

439
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
That and I just got in shape and partied.

440
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Now did you do more drill once you're getting ready to deploy?

441
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Oh, yeah.

442
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So when I say drill, I guess I should explain,

443
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
that's the deal for reserveist to go in.

444
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
That's like one week in the month.

445
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
That's your drill.

446
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
That's called the drill, yeah.

447
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
I escalate that at all when you're going to deploy.

448
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Yeah.

449
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000
So they kind of cater the drills that you do based on what you're going to need upcoming.

450
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:18.000
So I do recall we did a couple where we would do go do like an IED training section.

451
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And then we would, since I had experience now,

452
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
we would just take whenever we were at a drill, we would just start training the other new guys that we're going to be going with us on machine guns,

453
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
metal detectors and just try getting them trained up.

454
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
But yeah, and so a lot of the training was kind of on our own,

455
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
because you only get that one week in a month and they only have so much money and they have to train the whole company as opposed to just the platoon that's going.

456
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Right.

457
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
So, so then did they activate you?

458
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
How far before deployment do they activate? You see you can do some like legitimate real training.

459
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:03.000
So we did we actually managed to get a month at Camp Lijoon at Courthouse Bay, which is the combat engineer school.

460
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And so we did managed to get a month long school of, you know, just doing demolition, refreshment, more IED stuff, patrol practice, you know, just doing all sorts of training like that.

461
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
And then your work up is pretty much just how over long it takes to do Mahaveviper with your battalion.

462
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And then maybe a month before that.

463
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
So, so maybe three months total before you're going on.

464
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Yeah, I'm going to if you stack it on the floor three four months.

465
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Got it.

466
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And were you, when the rest of the guys, so it's one platoon that's going?

467
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
One platoon.

468
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
One platoon.

469
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Wasn't even a full platoon, there's just three squats.

470
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Okay. So how many guys did that total?

471
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
It was actually even short squats too. So it was let me think.

472
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
It's, there was a fire to nine ten eleven per squad.

473
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Yeah, so it's a like 35.

474
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So then three for the, the brass of the platoon.

475
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
So check.

476
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Then you go, you do your desert drill and everyone's unified and then you,

477
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
leave before that and then you, and then you go on deployment.

478
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Yeah, so they give you a little bit of, yeah, they give you a little bit of leave before you go.

479
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Or you have to go over some, it's like four or five days.

480
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
So everybody flies home and then.

481
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Got it.

482
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
So now you show up in Afghanistan and what's, how's that different from Iraq when you get there?

483
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
You know what, the first portion of it was not that different.

484
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
The terrain was a lot different.

485
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
So where do you, where do you first go?

486
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So in Afghanistan, we were, we started.

487
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I was, I deployed with three seven as an attachment,

488
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Therbatai and seven for any core regimen.

489
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And we were in Deloram, which I, I'm pretty sure it was in Helman province.

490
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
It was kind of right on the border.

491
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
So I don't recall exactly, but.

492
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And pretty much, Keylo company was the company that my squad was attached to.

493
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
And they got sent out just in the middle of nowhere.

494
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
To a fob.

495
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And then they had a patrol base that was even smaller.

496
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
You didn't even further out that I got sent to.

497
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
I was a team later.

498
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
And so usually you would have one team in the one spot and one team in the other spot.

499
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
But since we were kind of short on guys,

500
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
it was pretty much I was the only engineer for that.

501
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Platoon.

502
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And yeah, so we were in Deloram.

503
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
And so in Habe Nia was urban.

504
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Everything was really walking through a city.

505
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Everything was urban, but Afghanistan was just.

506
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
There.

507
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And what when you got out to this forward base, what were you doing?

508
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
What were you guys doing out there?

509
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
What was the, what was the infantry thing that you were attached to doing out there?

510
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Uh, patrolling.

511
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
So it was kind of similar.

512
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
That's why I say it wasn't whole lot different from Iraq because we were.

513
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Basically just interacting with the local populace.

514
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Uh, find out what they needed providing security for that area.

515
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Like they had a bizarre that would come every weekend.

516
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
So we could go out provide security for that.

517
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And so I was still using my metal detector to clear danger areas if we can't,

518
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
there's a lot of bodies out there.

519
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
So we'd have to funnel through the body.

520
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
So I'd check that.

521
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
How often were you, we find in IEDs.

522
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
And that's the first one.

523
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
I didn't find a one on there.

524
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Yeah, there was, it was a pretty pacified area.

525
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I think we had one firefight.

526
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
One of the squads got into.

527
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Mm-hmm.

528
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
And that's it.

529
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Um, so so your first part of the deployment and how long was that?

530
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
How long was that part of the deployment?

531
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
That was two and a half, three months I think.

532
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
So that's kind of like a little tune up.

533
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Right.

534
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And then we passed that area off to the Georgian army.

535
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And that's when we moved to sang into, to take over from the Brits.

536
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And now sang in like, that's Helman Province central.

537
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Yeah, that's, that's, that's it.

538
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Yeah, that's Talban central down there.

539
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Uh, yeah.

540
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
And, uh, as soon as you get on the ground there, did you feel it when you got on the ground?

541
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
We knew, yeah.

542
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
I mean, we kind of did a push into that area before we actually moved out there.

543
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:21.000
And we knew shit was getting real when we, uh, they just, they're like pack up a pack.

544
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
And we got on the helicopter.

545
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
And they just flew us out and just dropped us off in the middle of,

546
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
absolutely nowhere.

547
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
And we just started walking.

548
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
It was just leave your packs here and start walking that way.

549
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And just, just basically just taking territory from the Talban.

550
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Now did you do guys do a thorough turnover with the Brits?

551
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
I wasn't a part of that, but, not, I mean, we pretty much came into Fahb increment.

552
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
And we're there for a day, day and a half.

553
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And the Brits were gone.

554
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
No, no, we came in and then you pushed out.

555
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
So the Brits were there when you were there on the ground.

556
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Yeah, we were both there at the same time.

557
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Probably the headquarters elements were doing a turnover.

558
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Yeah.

559
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
They were like, hey, we're getting our boys out.

560
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Yeah, we started pushing immediately.

561
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
And we had a couple, whirl Marines with us and some British army.

562
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Whether, I think they had a small or maybe a toe that we didn't have.

563
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So like units that we, we needed from them.

564
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
They would send out with us.

565
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
And they were great.

566
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
But from what I understood, they just didn't have the manpower to really do much.

567
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Were they the guys that were with you?

568
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Were they giving you any turnover items?

569
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Like, hey, you need to look out for this.

570
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Hey, this is what's going on here.

571
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
No, I didn't receive any.

572
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Because I, I just don't think they really went out much.

573
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So I don't really sure how much they really could have told us about what was outside of the patrol bases.

574
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
And I never, I don't even remember.

575
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I think we may have talked to their common engineers.

576
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
We got some demo from them.

577
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Like, hey, can we have some deck hoarding that gave it to us?

578
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And that's about it.

579
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Yeah, and that's because they were just completely undermaned.

580
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Yeah, from what I understand, I mean, obviously I'm not a part of the upper echelon out there and stuff.

581
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
But I think that's the reason they just, they set up patrol bases.

582
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
They had the patrol bases.

583
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
But they pretty much just sat there and got ambushed and got shot out every day.

584
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Didn't do a lot of patrol.

585
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
So then you guys roll in and the, like the broad strategies you're going to start moving

586
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
from patrol base, you're going to push out, take another compound, secure it,

587
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
and then operate out of there for a while and then push it on.

588
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Yeah, pretty much just take the tail of the instairtory by going out, clearing a compound.

589
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
And that's what a major part of what I was doing on this push was clearing compounds.

590
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
This is in case there were a booby trapped.

591
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And then yeah, we take over that compound, sandbag it up, knock down some trees and some

592
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
explosives, create those fields of fire.

593
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And then once I was set up, start doing some patrols, security patrols, and then

594
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
repeat.

595
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And were you guys getting in contact with the towel band?

596
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Yeah, they were often.

597
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000
They were pretty much shooting at us most days, murdering us most days, not very accurate.

598
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
But yeah, they were shooting at us at least.

599
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
And we, when we would go out on patrols, they'd shoot at us.

600
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
But they were always shooting from way far away.

601
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
And, you know, we'd shoot back, but it wasn't like further on in the deployment.

602
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
When the corn grew a lot taller, I wasn't there for it because I got hurt by them.

603
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
But that was when they were like, people were shooting at each other in the corn field, like five feet away.

604
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
So, but while you were there, it was more distant, really far distant contact.

605
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Yeah. Yeah. Were you guys taking any casualties?

606
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
I think not, not times. I mean, obviously everyone is a major, major sacrifice.

607
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:06.000
But there was one sniper that got killed on the initial push on Musica Law before we even got to singing.

608
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And besides that, I don't remember, oh, my buddy Ronnie got hit in the face of the piece of RPG.

609
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
He didn't go home, he just had to go get it taken care of.

610
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
So, mine or stuff like that.

611
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
But yeah, that mine or stuff only happens when stuff is going on.

612
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Yeah. So, and by the way, that little piece of shot, I'll blow you know, that thing can kill you just as easily as, you know, a full piece of shot.

613
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
You're wet in his eye? Yeah, exactly.

614
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000
But I would say, so you're like, now, every patrol that you guys are going out is like, hey,

615
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
now, how often are you finding IEDs at this point?

616
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Not tons.

617
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Trying to think.

618
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And every now and then, not very often.

619
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah.

620
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.000
I mean, because the, I think the area that we were initially was still pretty close to the main fob.

621
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Mm.

622
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And then as you went out, there would be just fields of them.

623
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
And the way that we were getting out to the patrol bases were we were using mixlicks.

624
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000
And so that was mitigating a lot of the searching that we would have had to do.

625
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
So, in that initial area, weren't finding tons.

626
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Just every, every now and then.

627
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
And I don't know if this is right or not, but, you know, with the closer you get to a fob,

628
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
you have security on the fob, you have guys that are looking out.

629
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
So, it's hard for someone to come in and dig out and put in the ground.

630
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So, you got some level of security around the fobs.

631
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Most of the time.

632
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Obviously, there could be something there preexisting.

633
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And day to day life.

634
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Are you guys, are you guys on MREs or are you guys getting chow or what's going on day to day life?

635
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Oh, man.

636
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I wish we had MRE.

637
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
So, at some point during the deployment, we started on MREs.

638
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
You know, I like MREs.

639
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I think they were good.

640
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
You're sick.

641
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.000
I used to like MREs when I was like 22 and then I OD don't.

642
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Yeah, I didn't mind them too much.

643
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
But then, when we started doing these pushes, we got these things called first strike rations.

644
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Like the new MRE.

645
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
But here's the problem with these first strike.

646
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
They were awesome.

647
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
When we first got on the first week, they were awesome.

648
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.000
But the MREs core only decided it would be good to buy three different meals.

649
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And kind of at the same time, we had outrun our water supply.

650
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
So we were just stopping off at Wells.

651
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And guess what?

652
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Nobody had any kind of pure fine stuff.

653
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
So we were just drinking well water.

654
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
And obviously, what you would expect to happen happened.

655
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Everybody was getting sick.

656
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Just, you know, diarrhea, vomiting.

657
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
That's crazy.

658
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
No purification tabs, right?

659
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I don't know.

660
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I guess they didn't expect us to need to use wells.

661
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
But the first day, everybody ran out of water by the time we ended and we were like,

662
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
well, we just got to go get well water.

663
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Isn't that crazy?

664
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
A purification pill is like, I'm talking at you.

665
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Echo like it's a little tiny thing.

666
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
But you can carry them so easily.

667
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And they completely changed the game.

668
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Because you can take that water out of a well or stream.

669
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
That's got whatever bacteria on it.

670
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Put that thing in there, shake it up.

671
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
You're good to go.

672
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Does it taste different?

673
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
No, not really.

674
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Not really.

675
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
People use them camping.

676
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
This is iodine tablets.

677
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Yeah, yeah.

678
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
And you can also bring a filter.

679
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Yeah.

680
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Like when I hike, I bring a filter, which is like a little pump.

681
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Like a perita.

682
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
No, it's not a perita.

683
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
You know, this is a pity.

684
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
No, it's not that.

685
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
A little pump.

686
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
A little pump.

687
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Yeah, yeah.

688
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And how long are you guys going out in the field for?

689
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Let's see.

690
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
The first push in the busclaw was about two weeks.

691
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And so we just, yeah, walk for two weeks.

692
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
We walk to a compound.

693
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Stop for the day.

694
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Set security.

695
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Spend the night.

696
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Walk to the next one.

697
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
If they shoot at us.

698
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Fiber.

699
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Kill him.

700
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Whatever do whatever we got to do.

701
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
And then we just kept pushing out and pushing out.

702
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
And then eventually we got to a point in that first musclaw push where.

703
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
For whatever reason, they just say, all right, now you're going to walk back.

704
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:38.000
So I think I think maybe our, I think maybe our battalion commander had actually.

705
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:46.000
He had been a little bit too aggressive and had gone beyond his limits that his boss wanted him to do.

706
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Yeah.

707
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
We ended up having to give up territory we had just taken.

708
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Yeah.

709
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
And yeah, so that was two weeks.

710
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
But then once we got to sang and it was pretty much.

711
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Spended day doing the push.

712
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Take the compounds.

713
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
And then you kind of in the compound you just got a patrol and you come back.

714
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
So we weren't really out in the field for all that long.

715
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
But you know, being in a compound still not exactly luxury.

716
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Yeah.

717
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
We still have showers.

718
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
It's not the Kona Kira's or definitely not.

719
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
All right, man.

720
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I'm going to talk about I'm going to go to your journal here.

721
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Because obviously on one of these patrols.

722
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
You got hit.

723
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
And here's what you wrote about it.

724
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Two things happened simultaneously when whatever explosive device that hit me exploded.

725
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
First, the shockwave cut through my toes, severing them.

726
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
It didn't slow as it cut through my shins, severing them next.

727
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:09.000
It sent dirt, grit, and shrapnel upward into my legs, buttocks, and any other part of my body that was exposed.

728
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Next it launched me a few feet into the air and deposited me onto the ground unconscious.

729
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Blood was pouring out of the newly opened arteries and into the dirt.

730
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Muscle and bone dangled from the remnants of my legs.

731
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Vicious bacteria latched on and invaded through the note new openings.

732
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.000
The dust rose and settled and I woke up.

733
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000
The first 10 seconds after waking up, all I could hear were my own screams.

734
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
All I could see was a blurry tunnel looking up to the sky.

735
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
The weird thing about the screams was that my brain wasn't telling my body to produce them.

736
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:07.000
It was almost as if my mind was no longer present and my body was just reacting or more like panicking.

737
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:16.000
They were the kind of screams that are emitted from a person regardless of the consideration of the personal pride that the person has.

738
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:24.000
No matter how much their pride makes them resist crying out, they don't have a choice in the matter.

739
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:40.000
They inhale too long fools of air open their mouth as wide as it will go and expel that air with full force producing a scream that pierces the air and changes pitch with no control.

740
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.000
As seconds clicked away, my mind started to come back online and my body calmed down.

741
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
I stopped screaming and my other senses returned.

742
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.000
I smelled dust and the unique chemical smell of the recent explosion.

743
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
I tasted it on my tongue and in my throat.

744
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
After that my feeling came back.

745
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:14.000
It wasn't so much pain as one would imagine it, but more like my lower legs had fallen asleep for so long that it hurt.

746
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Except magnified by 50 times.

747
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
I knew that they were gone, but how much?

748
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.000
I had decided before I left on this deployment that I could live with below the knee amputations, but anything higher than that, no thanks.

749
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
I'd rather bleed out.

750
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:45.000
I could hear Keith Johnson telling me that they were coming for me and soon he and Shane Otoil were over me applying turnic hits to the bleeding stumps that used to be legs.

751
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
I mustered up the courage to look at my hands.

752
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Intact.

753
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I moved them downward to check on something vastly more important.

754
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000
The numbness I felt down there left me unsure of its status.

755
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Just kill me.

756
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
I croaked out.

757
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
They ignored me of course and kept telling me how everything was going to be okay.

758
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:18.000
We're holding my hands as the corpsman knelt over me and delivered the sweet, sweet morophone that made it all better.

759
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Kill me man.

760
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
I said again, I don't want to live like this.

761
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
I think my dick is gone.

762
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Your dick is still there, man.

763
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Do you want me to touch it?

764
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Johnson asked?

765
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
I chuckled with relief as I replied, no.

766
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I asked whether the legs were gone above or below the knee.

767
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
I was reassured to hear that both were a few inches below.

768
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000
By this time I was high from the morphine and was saying everything that crossed my mind.

769
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:59.000
As the corpsman continued to work and we waited for the ten-line calves of act to be called in, I thought about all the things I wouldn't be doing anymore.

770
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
I thought about playing Racketball.

771
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:07.000
I thought about working out in the gym. I thought about being in a wheelchair for the next 50 years.

772
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000
I never thought about how I was breeding, bleeding profusely from two major arteries and could die.

773
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
I never once thought I would die, which may seem unusual for a person in my position.

774
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Naturally optimistic I suppose.

775
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Although it is hard to claim that I was being optimistic considering I wanted to cash out permanently.

776
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
In my defense I had no idea what life was like as an amputee and if I had back then I wouldn't have made that request.

777
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Either way, I'm glad I stuck around.

778
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Around this time I decided to sit up and take a look at the damage.

779
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
I took a deep breath and gulped.

780
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:05.000
I slowly started sitting up but when I got to the point where going further would reveal my shredded legs, I had a change of heart.

781
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
I didn't see the blood soaked dirt.

782
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
I didn't see the disjointed lower parts of my calves and chins along with my feet.

783
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Or the jagged edge of my remaining limbs, the skin roughly burned and shorn the bone sticking out, then the rip muscle dangling along the ground.

784
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:33.000
I didn't want that image to be inside of my head because I knew it would be one that I would never be able to forget.

785
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000
I deeply regret the fact that there are those that I consider friends that were forced to have that image in their mind.

786
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000
And we'll have to live with it for their entire lives.

787
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Secondly, I was afraid of seeing the wound would make it hurt even more, much like a scraped knee as a child.

788
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.000
I laid back down and let the morphine keep doing its job.

789
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
I started getting sleepy.

790
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I just wanted to close my eyes.

791
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000
I thought maybe if I closed my eyes, I would pass away easily.

792
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Slap!

793
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I'll slap my cheek as he yelled at me to stay awake.

794
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Just let me sleep, just let me sleep by mumbled, closing my eyes again.

795
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Another slap.

796
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
That was the last time I did that.

797
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Finally, the stretcher that was going to carry me out arrived.

798
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Four strong men lifted me onto it, grabbed each one of the handles and started carrying me to an assault breach of vehicle.

799
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:49.000
They were carrying me away from the war I volunteered to participate in and the Marines that I was supposed to be leading and protecting.

800
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
They would have to go on without me all because I had failed in my job.

801
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Failed to find the IED that I knew was somewhere around us.

802
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
That failure was a hard pill to swallow then and it remained so to this day.

803
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
I didn't feel good about leaving them behind, but I knew they would understand.

804
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
I knew they would be okay without me.

805
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:24.000
We got to the assault breach of vehicle and I asked Jimmy Goodwin one last time to put me out of my misery.

806
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:31.000
After his refusal, that was the last time I ever contemplated accepting that avenue.

807
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:42.000
They slid me into the back of the vehicle and with some Marines I had never met whose faces I can remember seeing but don't remember any of their features.

808
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:57.000
The corpsman said he was going to give me something to put me to sleep and I finally got to close my eyes as everything went black.

809
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:09.000
You pretty clear about what happened.

810
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
I remember pretty loosely.

811
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
I don't know.

812
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
I think I was unconscious for maybe 20 seconds.

813
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
I would estimate because they hadn't even gotten to me by the time I woke up.

814
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
I don't think they would have spent a whole lot of time.

815
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:34.000
I think one of my guys might have cleared over to me but I don't know.

816
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I kind of wish I had thought of something better to say.

817
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
It got me boys.

818
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
I'm like pre-lessing learned.

819
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
I really cool cinematic moment and script to go with.

820
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Just in case.

821
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000
I wish I would have thought of something better than.

822
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:05.000
I think it's a piece of the story that I'd really like to see.

823
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:12.000
The interesting thing about they said I was below the knee.

824
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000
A lot of the times what happens, you might be below the knee at side of injury.

825
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000
But I said infection that dirt over there is nasty.

826
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.20
We're not used to their bacteria.

827
00:57:24.20 --> 00:57:29.28
It'll get in there, it'll infect and they have to end up chopping you off higher to save your life

828
00:57:29.28 --> 00:57:32.68
because the infection is just uncontrollable.

829
00:57:32.68 --> 00:57:42.44
And also, if they don't have viable tissue bones and muscles that they can sculpt in such

830
00:57:42.44 --> 00:57:50.20
a way that you can put a prosthetic on there, they'll just cut you off at the next viable

831
00:57:50.20 --> 00:57:51.20
spot.

832
00:57:51.20 --> 00:57:53.20
Right.

833
00:57:53.20 --> 00:58:02.12
And there's gotta be like, you had to have known, or you know this is a possibility, right?

834
00:58:02.12 --> 00:58:07.24
When you're over there, how much did you think about that possibility?

835
00:58:07.24 --> 00:58:10.64
It's probably the same thing when you were going to the body.

836
00:58:10.64 --> 00:58:15.04
I mean, you know, everybody knows you could die.

837
00:58:15.04 --> 00:58:16.44
You could get killed.

838
00:58:16.44 --> 00:58:17.84
But it's not going to be me.

839
00:58:17.84 --> 00:58:18.84
It's fine.

840
00:58:18.84 --> 00:58:20.56
I'm not going to happen.

841
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:22.28
But you kind of have to do that, don't you?

842
00:58:22.28 --> 00:58:28.28
I mean, if I'm sitting there sweeping and I'm thinking, okay, here we go.

843
00:58:28.28 --> 00:58:29.68
This could be it.

844
00:58:29.68 --> 00:58:31.28
Every step, I'm not going to be effective.

845
00:58:31.28 --> 00:58:35.28
Yeah, there's got to be whether people refer to it the way I refer to it, like the idea

846
00:58:35.28 --> 00:58:38.88
of detachment and you're just like not going to think about that.

847
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:41.84
What he must be doing that, because otherwise you'd go freaking crazy.

848
00:58:41.84 --> 00:58:45.56
Like if you were just thinking this next step could be the one, I don't know, you never

849
00:58:45.56 --> 00:58:46.56
be able to take a step.

850
00:58:46.56 --> 00:58:47.56
You could handle it.

851
00:58:47.56 --> 00:58:50.72
And you go out there on patrol and you see Marines and soldiers and the seals that

852
00:58:50.72 --> 00:58:52.76
they know everyone's doing, they're job.

853
00:58:52.76 --> 00:58:57.44
Just completely setting that fear aside and saying, okay, that's a possibility.

854
00:58:57.44 --> 00:58:58.44
Cool.

855
00:58:58.44 --> 00:58:59.92
I don't have time to worry about that right now.

856
00:58:59.92 --> 00:59:01.44
I'm going to get it done.

857
00:59:01.44 --> 00:59:07.32
But I have, I made a dark joke before I went to Afghanistan.

858
00:59:07.32 --> 00:59:09.32
I went to this 5k with a buddy.

859
00:59:09.32 --> 00:59:13.96
He said, oh, we're going to do it again when we get back from Afghanistan.

860
00:59:13.96 --> 00:59:17.80
When you get back from Afghanistan, I was like, yeah, except you're going to be pulling

861
00:59:17.80 --> 00:59:23.000
me on a Rickshaw because I'm going to have both my legs blown off.

862
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.24
He has yet to pull me on the Rickshaw.

863
00:59:24.24 --> 00:59:28.24
That's not funny.

864
00:59:28.24 --> 00:59:34.80
I mean, talk about, you know, fate or whatever.

865
00:59:34.80 --> 00:59:38.88
I don't know what, what, I don't know that's fate.

866
00:59:38.88 --> 00:59:39.88
That's just bad humor.

867
00:59:39.88 --> 00:59:44.04
I think that's what we call that.

868
00:59:44.04 --> 00:59:46.88
But you know what, that is a way you deal with these things, right?

869
00:59:46.88 --> 00:59:51.20
I mean, like, hey, we were kind of talking about the call over here, just like sick humor

870
00:59:51.20 --> 00:59:55.88
that you end up with in the military because you have to take that thought, which is in your

871
00:59:55.88 --> 00:59:57.88
head, like it's got to be in your head.

872
00:59:57.88 --> 00:59:59.28
So what are you going to do with it?

873
00:59:59.28 --> 01:00:03.52
Are you going to let it like burden you down and make you inoperable and make you not

874
01:00:03.52 --> 01:00:04.76
be able to do your job?

875
01:00:04.76 --> 01:00:06.000
Are you, you know what?

876
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.60
We're going to make a joke about it.

877
01:00:07.60 --> 01:00:09.32
And that's how we're going to get through this.

878
01:00:09.32 --> 01:00:11.28
So more than anything else, it's actually great.

879
01:00:11.28 --> 01:00:12.28
I shouldn't have said bad humor.

880
01:00:12.28 --> 01:00:15.76
I shouldn't have said great humor because that's the kind of humor that I'm free to hear

881
01:00:15.76 --> 01:00:16.76
that all the time.

882
01:00:16.76 --> 01:00:17.76
Yeah.

883
01:00:17.76 --> 01:00:20.68
You know, all the time from guys from my seals were ridiculous.

884
01:00:20.68 --> 01:00:25.36
My guys are just, I mean, the sickest sense of humor you could imagine.

885
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:29.28
But yeah, the same thing with the soldiers and there wasn't even, there's no barrier.

886
01:00:29.28 --> 01:00:32.40
Like there's no barrier for that sick sense of humor when you're in the military.

887
01:00:32.40 --> 01:00:39.000
It's just like there and you're allowed pretty much to say it across services.

888
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.60
You can make a joke to Marina or our new soldier about something and they're not going to

889
01:00:43.60 --> 01:00:44.60
beat.

890
01:00:44.60 --> 01:00:45.60
They're not going to be offended by it.

891
01:00:45.60 --> 01:00:50.96
Everyone's got that same twisted sense of humor that really, if you think about it,

892
01:00:50.96 --> 01:00:55.72
we're all probably using to cope with the fact that these bad things might happen.

893
01:00:55.72 --> 01:01:02.36
Yeah, I think I've often, like, trying to wonder why they say,

894
01:01:02.36 --> 01:01:06.32
you know, laughter is the best medicine and why it's so true.

895
01:01:06.32 --> 01:01:12.04
And it's, I think it, it acts to normalize your situation.

896
01:01:12.04 --> 01:01:17.84
So, you know, how if you're about to try and deadlift like a thousand pounds.

897
01:01:17.84 --> 01:01:23.84
I'm going to be like, you're trying to deadlift 8,000 pounds.

898
01:01:23.84 --> 01:01:27.72
And you're sitting there going, there's no way I'm going to deadlift this 8,000 pounds.

899
01:01:27.72 --> 01:01:29.60
You're going to go up to it and it's going to stick to the ground.

900
01:01:29.60 --> 01:01:31.92
That predeterminate self predetermination.

901
01:01:31.92 --> 01:01:32.92
Right.

902
01:01:32.92 --> 01:01:37.92
And so if you're sitting there, let's say after I got hurt and I'm sitting there going,

903
01:01:37.92 --> 01:01:41.36
this is the worst thing to ever happen.

904
01:01:41.36 --> 01:01:43.20
This sucks.

905
01:01:43.20 --> 01:01:44.40
I hate this.

906
01:01:44.40 --> 01:01:46.40
It's so serious.

907
01:01:46.40 --> 01:01:48.80
It's such a big deal.

908
01:01:48.80 --> 01:01:52.000
Then yeah, it becomes the worst thing that ever happened.

909
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.16
And I just kind of get into that groove.

910
01:01:56.16 --> 01:02:00.24
But if you can make a joke about it, it kind of makes fun of it.

911
01:02:00.24 --> 01:02:02.92
So it's not as serious.

912
01:02:02.92 --> 01:02:08.48
And so when something's not as serious or not as big a deal, you make fun of something,

913
01:02:08.48 --> 01:02:10.92
it kind of becomes normal to you.

914
01:02:10.92 --> 01:02:13.68
And a little bit easier to accept.

915
01:02:13.68 --> 01:02:20.34
If you saw, if I saw my drone structure crack a smile at any point, if you even did

916
01:02:20.34 --> 01:02:27.64
this or anything like that, then they automatically lose their persona.

917
01:02:27.64 --> 01:02:31.64
So if, and you can tell, sometimes they were getting ready to crack a smile and they'd be

918
01:02:31.64 --> 01:02:33.64
like, they just walk on.

919
01:02:33.64 --> 01:02:35.40
They'd have to just walk away.

920
01:02:35.40 --> 01:02:42.44
So I think that that's probably why you have to maintain your humor in order to survive.

921
01:02:42.44 --> 01:02:43.56
You really do.

922
01:02:43.56 --> 01:02:46.16
Yeah, I know doubt about that.

923
01:02:46.16 --> 01:02:49.88
That's awesome.

924
01:02:49.88 --> 01:02:53.92
Going back to your journal here, it took me five days to make it from Dusty Uncomfortable

925
01:02:53.92 --> 01:02:59.88
Blast Crater in Afghanistan to a sterile, uncomfortable hospital bed in the ICU at the

926
01:02:59.88 --> 01:03:03.64
National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

927
01:03:03.64 --> 01:03:08.20
Luckily for me, I was much too high on what's that deal of do it?

928
01:03:08.20 --> 01:03:09.68
Delauded, delauded.

929
01:03:09.68 --> 01:03:10.68
Delauded.

930
01:03:10.68 --> 01:03:11.68
Yeah.

931
01:03:11.68 --> 01:03:14.000
To notice the bed or the trip.

932
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.52
My amputations had started out below the knee, but somewhere during the three hospital

933
01:03:17.52 --> 01:03:22.76
stops along the way, the need rose for the remaining portions below my knees to be taken

934
01:03:22.76 --> 01:03:23.76
off.

935
01:03:23.76 --> 01:03:29.92
A lot of the time this is due to infections that are picked up from the dirt in Afghanistan.

936
01:03:29.92 --> 01:03:37.12
Or maybe there wasn't much that existed below the knees to make keeping them viable.

937
01:03:37.12 --> 01:03:42.80
On the bright side, however, the stumps that were remaining were of a significant length

938
01:03:42.80 --> 01:03:45.84
for an above knee amputation.

939
01:03:45.84 --> 01:03:50.88
I was left with the entire femur on my left leg and only a few inches shy on my right

940
01:03:50.88 --> 01:03:52.60
leg.

941
01:03:52.60 --> 01:03:56.92
I found it funny that throughout my entire hospital stay, the remainder of my legs

942
01:03:56.92 --> 01:04:01.28
were always referred to as stumps by the medical staff.

943
01:04:01.28 --> 01:04:06.68
I had expected a more elegant term, considering the fact that this was a hospital.

944
01:04:06.68 --> 01:04:11.72
At the same time, however, I enjoyed the casual nature of the word stump and even considered

945
01:04:11.72 --> 01:04:14.20
naming them at one point.

946
01:04:14.20 --> 01:04:17.96
Later, when perusing my medical records, I found the elegant term I had been looking

947
01:04:17.96 --> 01:04:24.32
for residual limb.

948
01:04:24.32 --> 01:04:29.36
Along with the major injuries I sustained, I also had a few minor injuries.

949
01:04:29.36 --> 01:04:34.04
I used the term minor loosely here, seeing as how these minor injuries would be considered

950
01:04:34.04 --> 01:04:40.72
major if they weren't sustained in tandem with the severing of one's lower legs.

951
01:04:40.72 --> 01:04:45.08
Starting from the lower person's first, I lost a portion of the muscles making up the

952
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:47.32
inner part of my right thigh.

953
01:04:47.32 --> 01:04:51.76
In order to close that wound, I would require a skin graft taken from the skin of my left

954
01:04:51.76 --> 01:04:52.76
thigh.

955
01:04:52.76 --> 01:04:58.80
My buttocks are sustained several large wounds from shrapnel, some close to the sphincter,

956
01:04:58.80 --> 01:05:01.64
but mostly in the more meaty parts.

957
01:05:01.64 --> 01:05:02.80
That was okay, though.

958
01:05:02.80 --> 01:05:07.24
I have always had an extra butt muscle to go around.

959
01:05:07.24 --> 01:05:11.96
The close proximity of these wounds to the working parts of the digestive system resulted

960
01:05:11.96 --> 01:05:18.28
in the doctors diverting my intestines to a colostomy bag that came through my abdominal

961
01:05:18.28 --> 01:05:19.28
area.

962
01:05:19.28 --> 01:05:22.88
The reason for doing this wasn't because of any damage to the intestines, but because the

963
01:05:22.88 --> 01:05:27.44
doctors wanted to make sure that the large wounds on my butt didn't get infected.

964
01:05:27.44 --> 01:05:32.12
As for upper body injuries, I had some minor burns to my hands and two totally perforated

965
01:05:32.12 --> 01:05:33.28
ear drums.

966
01:05:33.28 --> 01:05:37.16
The hands would heal and my ear drums would be replaced with cartilage.

967
01:05:37.16 --> 01:05:41.40
I consider myself extremely lucky that I still have all 10 fingers in perfect work

968
01:05:41.40 --> 01:05:42.40
in condition.

969
01:05:42.40 --> 01:05:46.68
My eyes and most significantly, a brain that made it through the blast with only a grade

970
01:05:46.68 --> 01:05:51.24
3 concussion and no residual traumatic brain injuries.

971
01:05:51.24 --> 01:05:55.36
While I may face hardships and have some sort of discomfort constantly throughout the

972
01:05:55.36 --> 01:06:00.20
day as a result of wearing prosthetics, at least it doesn't hurt.

973
01:06:00.20 --> 01:06:02.32
I don't have constant pain.

974
01:06:02.32 --> 01:06:07.40
Constant pain is much more harrowing, is a much more harrowing, platenine, and I can't imagine

975
01:06:07.40 --> 01:06:10.52
how hard it is to withstand.

976
01:06:10.52 --> 01:06:14.56
I spent my first week at Bethesda in the intensive care unit.

977
01:06:14.56 --> 01:06:19.16
I had a tube down my throat, one tube going into my arm, a breathing tube in my nose,

978
01:06:19.16 --> 01:06:24.32
a catheter, pads monitoring my heart rate, an epidural in my lower spine, and a wire

979
01:06:24.32 --> 01:06:26.92
from my pain button.

980
01:06:26.92 --> 01:06:29.44
Both my hands were wrapped in gauze from my burns.

981
01:06:29.44 --> 01:06:35.08
My legs were also wrapped in gauze, along with having wound-back machines attached to

982
01:06:35.08 --> 01:06:39.64
suck-out excess fluids leaking from my wounds.

983
01:06:39.64 --> 01:06:43.52
My rear end had a pad of gauze for the wounds there.

984
01:06:43.52 --> 01:06:47.88
The incision down the center of my abs used from my clostomy, had been stapled back

985
01:06:47.88 --> 01:06:53.80
together, and the bottom part parts of my stumps were where the skin was reconnected

986
01:06:53.80 --> 01:07:02.20
were stitched together.

987
01:07:02.20 --> 01:07:13.36
You know, you just piling all that other stuff onto, and it just like you said, you lost

988
01:07:13.36 --> 01:07:18.36
your legs, and you're like, oh, that's pretty much what a guy like me, I focus, oh,

989
01:07:18.36 --> 01:07:24.28
he lost his legs, obviously freaking horrible, and then you don't, a guy like me, I'm

990
01:07:24.28 --> 01:07:29.60
not thinking about all these other injuries that you're sustaining, and all the medical

991
01:07:29.60 --> 01:07:32.80
things that have to happen to get that stuff straightened out.

992
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:38.60
Yeah, I mean, any one of those, just like if it happened to one of us right now, any

993
01:07:38.60 --> 01:07:45.24
one of those would be major, but they're just pretty much nothing compared to the actual

994
01:07:45.24 --> 01:07:48.04
major thing that happened.

995
01:07:48.04 --> 01:07:52.16
And you're just, so are you just drugged up at this point?

996
01:07:52.16 --> 01:07:53.16
Yeah.

997
01:07:53.16 --> 01:08:01.96
That first week, I mean, yeah, just delotted Hayes hallucinations, and that kind of thing,

998
01:08:01.96 --> 01:08:10.88
and surgeries, I would hallucinate nasty things like being hit by a mortar and see

999
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:16.08
my legs splattered for whatever his my mom was there.

1000
01:08:16.08 --> 01:08:23.08
And then I recall for the first couple of weeks, every now and then, I don't know, I

1001
01:08:23.08 --> 01:08:27.44
had a discredit with something what happened, you felt explosions before, and there's

1002
01:08:27.44 --> 01:08:33.92
kind of that when the shockwave goes through you, and you kind of feel your brain kind of

1003
01:08:33.92 --> 01:08:41.08
jar a little bit, I would kind of fuel that, and then for a split second, I would kind

1004
01:08:41.08 --> 01:08:45.84
of, it would be like I was getting hit by an explosion for a split second, like that.

1005
01:08:45.84 --> 01:08:49.84
And I'd be like, did I just pass out or something?

1006
01:08:49.84 --> 01:08:53.12
Yeah, I'd be like, no, that's like, what is that?

1007
01:08:53.12 --> 01:08:56.92
So, but that, you know, that makes me kind of like, like mental after shockwave.

1008
01:08:56.92 --> 01:08:58.76
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what it was.

1009
01:08:58.76 --> 01:09:00.32
It's, I asked the doctors about it.

1010
01:09:00.32 --> 01:09:06.64
They said, I'm never, I don't know what that is, but luckily it went away, and after maybe

1011
01:09:06.64 --> 01:09:12.88
it had something to do with the drugs, I don't know, but, yeah, but you know, eventually

1012
01:09:12.88 --> 01:09:17.68
you get used to that, and body kind of gets adapted to it, and you get your senses

1013
01:09:17.68 --> 01:09:23.000
back, and it's hard to look at a computer screen for the first couple of weeks still, but

1014
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.68
eventually I would see ants crawling on me.

1015
01:09:27.68 --> 01:09:33.04
But yeah, you know, so eventually all that kind of goes away, and you just stuck with

1016
01:09:33.04 --> 01:09:36.12
your little button for pain.

1017
01:09:36.12 --> 01:09:40.56
I remember they, you can only hit the, it'll only let you hit it every three, four or

1018
01:09:40.56 --> 01:09:44.44
five minutes or something like that, and they would come in during the first little

1019
01:09:44.44 --> 01:09:47.60
bit, and they would say, you know, you can only

1020
01:09:47.60 --> 01:09:51.64
hit that thing like 12 times in a minute, right?

1021
01:09:51.64 --> 01:09:57.32
Is that, yeah, they say, well, you hit it about 110 times in the last hour.

1022
01:09:57.32 --> 01:10:02.96
I'm like, well, I'd be, because I'd be kind of like falling asleep, and then I'd hit it,

1023
01:10:02.96 --> 01:10:09.96
and doing, oh, make sure I make sure I got that hit, and so I'd just hit it again, and

1024
01:10:09.96 --> 01:10:16.72
so yeah, and then, but eventually kind of get used to it, and then pain starts to go away.

1025
01:10:16.72 --> 01:10:20.36
I'm sitting here thinking about like, I've been hospitalized a couple times for a couple

1026
01:10:20.36 --> 01:10:25.24
different surgeries, and what a complete pussy I was.

1027
01:10:25.24 --> 01:10:30.36
You know, in there like, this hurts, you know, and I, you know, this is, this is through,

1028
01:10:30.36 --> 01:10:34.80
you know, repair something, like I had a hernioporace, where I had a neck surgery.

1029
01:10:34.80 --> 01:10:38.60
Like, these are planned operations.

1030
01:10:38.60 --> 01:10:43.80
The openings in my body were made by a highly skilled surgeon, you know, and I'm in there

1031
01:10:43.80 --> 01:10:44.80
like, oh, this sucks.

1032
01:10:44.80 --> 01:10:51.56
So that, I mean, I can't, like, what you have is like a thousand times, a thousand times worse,

1033
01:10:51.56 --> 01:10:56.52
and it's hard to even imagine, and then on top of this, I'm going back to the journal

1034
01:10:56.52 --> 01:10:57.52
here to top it off.

1035
01:10:57.52 --> 01:11:00.88
I had my pirate hat on my head.

1036
01:11:00.88 --> 01:11:05.40
I was practically being held together by duct tape like an old dilapidated chair.

1037
01:11:05.40 --> 01:11:09.68
You're trying to get one or one more good year out of what's up with the pirate hat.

1038
01:11:09.68 --> 01:11:14.44
Well, so you're not supposed to wake up when you go through Germany.

1039
01:11:14.44 --> 01:11:21.44
So, basically, you go from sight of injury to Camp Leatherneck to Boggremar for his base,

1040
01:11:21.44 --> 01:11:25.96
to launch dual Germany to Bethesda, Maryland, for Marines, and then just go straight

1041
01:11:25.96 --> 01:11:27.92
to Walter Reed for anybody else.

1042
01:11:27.92 --> 01:11:30.40
Marines and sailors go to Bethesda.

1043
01:11:30.40 --> 01:11:38.52
And so, for whatever reason I wake up in Germany for, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes,

1044
01:11:38.52 --> 01:11:42.32
and my squad leader was there.

1045
01:11:42.32 --> 01:11:44.32
He was there for something else.

1046
01:11:44.32 --> 01:11:45.96
I don't remember what he was there for.

1047
01:11:45.96 --> 01:11:46.96
So he was there.

1048
01:11:46.96 --> 01:11:53.36
And he kind of told me what happened and that kind of thing.

1049
01:11:53.36 --> 01:11:58.88
And I couldn't help but think, even though it was super drugged up, my mom is going

1050
01:11:58.88 --> 01:12:02.12
to not, she's going to be sad.

1051
01:12:02.12 --> 01:12:07.20
And so, all I could think of, I'm always trying to crack a joke or whatever.

1052
01:12:07.20 --> 01:12:11.84
So I was like, see if you can find a funny hat.

1053
01:12:11.84 --> 01:12:14.84
So where would I go?

1054
01:12:14.84 --> 01:12:16.84
And he could find one.

1055
01:12:16.84 --> 01:12:17.84
Right?

1056
01:12:17.84 --> 01:12:19.84
They're not going to have funny hats in the hospital.

1057
01:12:19.84 --> 01:12:20.84
It's a serious place.

1058
01:12:20.84 --> 01:12:22.24
He went and looked, I guess.

1059
01:12:22.24 --> 01:12:23.84
Maybe he just went outside the room.

1060
01:12:23.84 --> 01:12:24.84
I couldn't find one.

1061
01:12:24.84 --> 01:12:26.84
He didn't go to the funny hat.

1062
01:12:26.84 --> 01:12:27.84
Yeah.

1063
01:12:27.84 --> 01:12:28.84
Boggrem has a lot of things.

1064
01:12:28.84 --> 01:12:32.84
Germany has a lot of things, but maybe not a funny hat store.

1065
01:12:32.84 --> 01:12:34.84
So, couldn't find one.

1066
01:12:34.84 --> 01:12:36.84
I get to Bethesda.

1067
01:12:36.84 --> 01:12:41.80
And when you get to the hospital, they pick you up from wherever they fly you into.

1068
01:12:41.80 --> 01:12:49.48
And these big, basically semi-tracked or trailer, host of ambulances.

1069
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:53.68
And they have, they alert the hospital where we're coming.

1070
01:12:53.68 --> 01:12:55.04
We're going to be there at 2 p.m.

1071
01:12:55.04 --> 01:13:01.24
And all the doctors come down and they rush you in and do what you need to do.

1072
01:13:01.24 --> 01:13:08.08
And so a lot of the times that's where families will see their servicemen when they first

1073
01:13:08.08 --> 01:13:09.36
get back when they're unloading them.

1074
01:13:09.36 --> 01:13:14.80
And they give them kind of, you know, 15, 20 seconds to, hey, good to see you.

1075
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:18.04
And then they take you off.

1076
01:13:18.04 --> 01:13:21.52
And I don't know how it happened.

1077
01:13:21.52 --> 01:13:24.72
But I'm rolling down the thing.

1078
01:13:24.72 --> 01:13:29.32
And there's my mom, she has this pirate hat in her hand.

1079
01:13:29.32 --> 01:13:32.96
Well, I don't know if somehow they got bored back to her.

1080
01:13:32.96 --> 01:13:33.96
You still don't know?

1081
01:13:33.96 --> 01:13:34.96
No, no.

1082
01:13:34.96 --> 01:13:39.32
No, I think somebody else brought it.

1083
01:13:39.32 --> 01:13:44.08
I don't know why they would have brought me a pirate hat.

1084
01:13:44.08 --> 01:13:48.24
And somebody had found out that I had asked for a stupid hat or something.

1085
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:54.64
I've never been known to wear pirate hats or stupid hats before.

1086
01:13:54.64 --> 01:13:57.12
So there's my mom with a stupid hat.

1087
01:13:57.12 --> 01:13:59.56
And then so it kind of became a theme.

1088
01:13:59.56 --> 01:14:01.20
Like, people would bring me a stupid hat.

1089
01:14:01.20 --> 01:14:02.20
Wouldn't they come and visit me?

1090
01:14:02.20 --> 01:14:05.68
So I had a big bag of adventure.

1091
01:14:05.68 --> 01:14:11.20
So I guess what happened, you know, I hope it kind of helped my ease the pain a little

1092
01:14:11.20 --> 01:14:18.36
bit for my mom and that initial, that initial meeting, maybe a little bit.

1093
01:14:18.36 --> 01:14:20.40
But I don't know.

1094
01:14:20.40 --> 01:14:24.24
So then you spend how long you and are you in, like I see you forward,

1095
01:14:24.24 --> 01:14:26.20
trying to get you more stabilized?

1096
01:14:26.20 --> 01:14:27.92
I was probably there for about a week.

1097
01:14:27.92 --> 01:14:32.96
And then you move up to the fifth floor of the hospital, which is kind of where they put

1098
01:14:32.96 --> 01:14:38.000
all the amputees and they're actually three Joneses there at the time.

1099
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.88
So the nurses had to be very careful.

1100
01:14:40.88 --> 01:14:44.84
And on top of that, my, I'm Jones RR.

1101
01:14:44.84 --> 01:14:45.84
First two initials.

1102
01:14:45.84 --> 01:14:50.28
My buddy who got hit maybe an hour before me, his name is Jones D.D.

1103
01:14:50.28 --> 01:14:53.48
And then the third Jones was Jones J.J.

1104
01:14:53.48 --> 01:15:00.40
So they had to be on it with, you know, with check and what medications are going to

1105
01:15:00.40 --> 01:15:06.88
who, but yeah, so that's then you go up to the fifth floor and that's kind of where

1106
01:15:06.88 --> 01:15:15.08
you start to become lucid and that's where the physical therapist start to come in.

1107
01:15:15.08 --> 01:15:20.24
And that's where once you're kind of ready, like you start just lifting a leg one ten times

1108
01:15:20.24 --> 01:15:21.24
and just lift your stomach.

1109
01:15:21.24 --> 01:15:25.88
And you described that in your journal, it was like exhausting for you to get that.

1110
01:15:25.88 --> 01:15:26.88
And it hurt.

1111
01:15:26.88 --> 01:15:30.60
And what's making it is it because you've been laying there for so long is because it's

1112
01:15:30.60 --> 01:15:32.96
a movement that you haven't been able to do in a while.

1113
01:15:32.96 --> 01:15:34.96
I don't just all the above.

1114
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:40.24
I would imagine a lot of that stuff down there is a swollen and painful.

1115
01:15:40.24 --> 01:15:42.60
You know, I think that's probably what it would be.

1116
01:15:42.60 --> 01:15:48.64
And so yeah, it hurts so bad to even move it at all.

1117
01:15:48.64 --> 01:15:52.36
And so they start with that and then eventually you get in your wheelchair and it takes

1118
01:15:52.36 --> 01:15:57.000
about 10 minutes for you to get into your wheelchair and take about four people to get you

1119
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
into your wheelchair.

1120
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.80
You're just sliding off and you're just so sore.

1121
01:16:01.80 --> 01:16:06.48
But eventually you get better and I could, you know, I made a big deal about the first

1122
01:16:06.48 --> 01:16:09.60
day that I got my wheelchair by myself.

1123
01:16:09.60 --> 01:16:16.96
And then I would go for little rolls around the floor and some might have to like, we

1124
01:16:16.96 --> 01:16:25.24
all my, my little IV pole and I have to hang my catheter bag on the, that was so scared.

1125
01:16:25.24 --> 01:16:28.000
I was like, watch that tube.

1126
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.28
Do not let that tube get caught into anything.

1127
01:16:33.28 --> 01:16:39.12
And so yeah, I would just do a few laps around the ward, get out.

1128
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:42.40
And then when I was done, I go visit my buddy Daniel because he couldn't get out of

1129
01:16:42.40 --> 01:16:48.40
bed yet because he had, I don't know why he can get out of bed, but he couldn't get

1130
01:16:48.40 --> 01:16:49.40
out of bed.

1131
01:16:49.40 --> 01:16:51.40
So I go in his room and hang out for a little while.

1132
01:16:51.40 --> 01:16:57.08
So then and then how long is it before you're thinking yourself, okay, or what makes

1133
01:16:57.08 --> 01:17:00.000
you start thinking, this is my game plan.

1134
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
This is where I'm going.

1135
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.48
Like you see guys that are further along the process and you say, okay, I see what

1136
01:17:06.48 --> 01:17:07.48
that guy's doing.

1137
01:17:07.48 --> 01:17:09.28
You know, I, I, I'm going to do that too.

1138
01:17:09.28 --> 01:17:16.32
Well, I sent a little, uh, iPhone message to Daniel, who is do down the, still down

1139
01:17:16.32 --> 01:17:17.32
the fifth floor.

1140
01:17:17.32 --> 01:17:20.20
My buddy took a little, he says, I want to say something to Daniel.

1141
01:17:20.20 --> 01:17:27.32
And so I said, listen, first step, make a workout program to get back to where we were

1142
01:17:27.32 --> 01:17:29.36
before, to get on our feet again.

1143
01:17:29.36 --> 01:17:30.36
So it was a media.

1144
01:17:30.36 --> 01:17:35.36
I was like, we are going to just work out and we're going to get better.

1145
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:39.68
And you know, so they don't do a lot of prosthetics at Bethesda.

1146
01:17:39.68 --> 01:17:44.20
Well, they do now, but they didn't back then.

1147
01:17:44.20 --> 01:17:50.36
And so the nurses would kind of have a general idea of how the prosthetics stuff went

1148
01:17:50.36 --> 01:17:52.72
and the physical therapist would know.

1149
01:17:52.72 --> 01:17:58.24
But the major thing was the visits from Walter Reed, so the wounded warrior battalion,

1150
01:17:58.24 --> 01:18:04.40
people would bring people that were further along in their recovery over to visit the

1151
01:18:04.40 --> 01:18:07.56
guys that had just been freshly wounded.

1152
01:18:07.56 --> 01:18:09.44
And so I got to one of those visits.

1153
01:18:09.44 --> 01:18:16.64
I don't remember, they're being a double above the knee amputee that came to see me that

1154
01:18:16.64 --> 01:18:19.08
was in legs yet.

1155
01:18:19.08 --> 01:18:22.04
But they had a better idea and they would say, look, you know, you're going to get over

1156
01:18:22.04 --> 01:18:26.28
there and you're going to get your prosthetics and you're going to be able to walk again.

1157
01:18:26.28 --> 01:18:27.28
You're going to be able to run.

1158
01:18:27.28 --> 01:18:29.20
You're going to be able to do this and that.

1159
01:18:29.20 --> 01:18:34.36
And so, at that point, like, oh, so I'm not going to, I don't have to do that.

1160
01:18:34.36 --> 01:18:35.36
It'd be in a wheelchair forever.

1161
01:18:35.36 --> 01:18:36.36
Oh, okay.

1162
01:18:36.36 --> 01:18:40.36
You know, so it was about at that point.

1163
01:18:40.36 --> 01:18:44.68
And then what did, how did you develop your workout program?

1164
01:18:44.68 --> 01:18:52.24
Well, once I became lucid, I was doing pull ups on my little triangle.

1165
01:18:52.24 --> 01:18:54.28
You know how they had little triangle thing dangling down?

1166
01:18:54.28 --> 01:18:55.28
I started getting after it.

1167
01:18:55.28 --> 01:18:57.12
I wasn't doing, well, I was doing pull ups.

1168
01:18:57.12 --> 01:19:01.12
I was probably doing like horizontal rows or something.

1169
01:19:01.12 --> 01:19:03.40
I was just like lifting myself up.

1170
01:19:03.40 --> 01:19:07.72
Whenever the physical therapist couldn't come in and do her stuff with me, I was like, oh,

1171
01:19:07.72 --> 01:19:11.44
I want this going to do, I'm going to pull myself up on this thing.

1172
01:19:11.44 --> 01:19:22.88
And so that was, and I kind of, I went off the therapist experience for most of it in

1173
01:19:22.88 --> 01:19:27.72
the beginning until I kind of got on my own because I don't, you know, they've been doing

1174
01:19:27.72 --> 01:19:30.48
this for nine years at that point.

1175
01:19:30.48 --> 01:19:35.16
So they had a lot of drills and strength and exercises that I can do and that kind of

1176
01:19:35.16 --> 01:19:36.16
things.

1177
01:19:36.16 --> 01:19:43.72
So I just kind of let them take the reins and just do whatever they said and then did it again.

1178
01:19:43.72 --> 01:19:48.000
But then once I got to a point where I was, we're kind of where you see me now, I'm walking

1179
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.20
around no problem.

1180
01:19:50.20 --> 01:19:55.12
That's when I started venturing into trying to do regular gym stuff.

1181
01:19:55.12 --> 01:19:58.56
And I invented my own way of doing straight leg deadlift.

1182
01:19:58.56 --> 01:20:02.80
So it's, I strap myself to a pole and I sit it down.

1183
01:20:02.80 --> 01:20:07.52
Do you think that's lean down and I do a straight leg deadlift as a put because I can't

1184
01:20:07.52 --> 01:20:08.52
squat.

1185
01:20:08.52 --> 01:20:10.64
Right, right.

1186
01:20:10.64 --> 01:20:11.88
Yeah.

1187
01:20:11.88 --> 01:20:16.96
I thought this was a really cool part of your journal that you wrote and you're talking

1188
01:20:16.96 --> 01:20:19.84
about getting through that kind of stuff.

1189
01:20:19.84 --> 01:20:22.72
So here we go back to the journal.

1190
01:20:22.72 --> 01:20:28.04
It's easy to be motivated to succeed in the beginning of an endeavor and when you are close

1191
01:20:28.04 --> 01:20:29.60
to the end.

1192
01:20:29.60 --> 01:20:35.000
The most difficult part and the part where people quit is when they are in the thick of

1193
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.48
it and it is unclear whether they have the strength and stamina to make it the rest of the

1194
01:20:40.48 --> 01:20:42.32
way.

1195
01:20:42.32 --> 01:20:47.44
While I never actually doubted my ability to walk again during my recovery, I am certainly

1196
01:20:47.44 --> 01:20:54.16
subject to the inner monologue rationalizing why it is okay to quit or to not push myself

1197
01:20:54.16 --> 01:20:57.92
to the goal that I have written down on paper.

1198
01:20:57.92 --> 01:21:05.44
One way I have recognized to aid in shutting that monologue the fuck up is celebrating

1199
01:21:05.44 --> 01:21:07.64
milestones.

1200
01:21:07.64 --> 01:21:14.20
The hardest part of working toward a goal is when we are either making slow progress or negative

1201
01:21:14.20 --> 01:21:19.32
progress and having the patience and confidence to know that the improvements we make over

1202
01:21:19.32 --> 01:21:25.48
the long periods as opposed to the short periods are what matter.

1203
01:21:25.48 --> 01:21:30.28
Milestones are what remind us that we are making progress even if it isn't apparent every

1204
01:21:30.28 --> 01:21:32.24
day.

1205
01:21:32.24 --> 01:21:36.88
In rowing, I've heard of people that count strokes until the finish line using sets of

1206
01:21:36.88 --> 01:21:46.40
10.

1207
01:21:46.40 --> 01:21:44.56
Personally, I like to count 250's for making up a race.

1208
01:21:44.56 --> 01:21:49.36
When I ran the nation's triathlon, I picked points ahead of me to make it to and when I got

1209
01:21:49.36 --> 01:21:52.32
there, I'd pick a new point.

1210
01:21:52.32 --> 01:21:59.04
Anything we can use to keep our minds from succumbing to the monologue will work.

1211
01:21:59.04 --> 01:22:05.20
Not only in short term goals, but also in long term goals like graduating from college

1212
01:22:05.20 --> 01:22:09.72
or learning to use prosthetics.

1213
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:13.72
Great advice for anybody to pay attention to.

1214
01:22:13.72 --> 01:22:17.16
Now you mentioned rowing there.

1215
01:22:17.16 --> 01:22:20.76
This was no weekend row that you decided to do.

1216
01:22:20.76 --> 01:22:22.76
You got after it.

1217
01:22:22.76 --> 01:22:26.24
How did that come about?

1218
01:22:26.24 --> 01:22:30.04
I was looking for that workout program.

1219
01:22:30.04 --> 01:22:32.96
I knew at this point, I'm alive.

1220
01:22:32.96 --> 01:22:40.000
I'm still trying to have the best life possible.

1221
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.92
I'm trying to get back what I lost.

1222
01:22:44.92 --> 01:22:52.24
I used to work it out and go into the gym, getting after it.

1223
01:22:52.24 --> 01:22:54.96
I'm sitting there going well.

1224
01:22:54.96 --> 01:23:00.000
What's another way that I can work out now?

1225
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.56
I started looking up, I forget what I looked up and disabled sports or disabled work.

1226
01:23:04.56 --> 01:23:06.92
I googled something.

1227
01:23:06.92 --> 01:23:09.56
Google getting after it.

1228
01:23:09.56 --> 01:23:14.52
I didn't have it.

1229
01:23:14.52 --> 01:23:16.64
The Paralympics comes up.

1230
01:23:16.64 --> 01:23:20.16
I don't know what the Paralympics is.

1231
01:23:20.16 --> 01:23:22.80
Like the special Olympics.

1232
01:23:22.80 --> 01:23:25.60
The answer to that question is no.

1233
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:30.52
The Paralympics is the Olympics for disabled people, with disabilities.

1234
01:23:30.52 --> 01:23:33.32
I said, all right, well, I fit into that category.

1235
01:23:33.32 --> 01:23:35.92
Let's see what sports they got.

1236
01:23:35.92 --> 01:23:37.72
I saw they had rowing.

1237
01:23:37.72 --> 01:23:40.92
You know what?

1238
01:23:40.92 --> 01:23:44.72
I used to hit the row on machine when I was working out.

1239
01:23:44.72 --> 01:23:46.12
Getting on the concept too.

1240
01:23:46.12 --> 01:23:49.40
The concept too, doing some sprints on that thing.

1241
01:23:49.40 --> 01:23:50.40
That was pretty tough.

1242
01:23:50.40 --> 01:23:54.12
I want something that's tough.

1243
01:23:54.12 --> 01:23:55.40
I was like, you know what?

1244
01:23:55.40 --> 01:23:59.12
I'm going to see, I'm going to look into this rowing thing.

1245
01:23:59.12 --> 01:24:02.68
Maybe I'll make the Paralympics one day.

1246
01:24:02.68 --> 01:24:08.92
This is when I was just got to the hospital for a second week in the hospital.

1247
01:24:08.92 --> 01:24:12.40
Not real, strong point in the patients area.

1248
01:24:12.40 --> 01:24:17.88
You've got to set yourself a goal right away.

1249
01:24:17.88 --> 01:24:24.000
You don't have to put something to your work indoors, then you just tread the water.

1250
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So yeah.

1251
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.48
And the lot of things fell into place.

1252
01:24:29.48 --> 01:24:34.36
I probably didn't go out and try and learn to row on the water until the next year.

1253
01:24:34.36 --> 01:24:39.76
So my main focus at that point was still learning the prosthetics and getting my strength

1254
01:24:39.76 --> 01:24:40.76
back.

1255
01:24:40.76 --> 01:24:49.96
But once I got my strength back, and I felt like I was ready to move on outside of the therapy

1256
01:24:49.96 --> 01:24:51.84
angle on it.

1257
01:24:51.84 --> 01:24:57.60
I looked up places where I could learn to row and just so happened there was one in DC.

1258
01:24:57.60 --> 01:25:01.36
So I went down there and I learned.

1259
01:25:01.36 --> 01:25:04.80
I mean, I don't want to brag, but the guy said I was a natural.

1260
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:09.16
So I said, well, maybe I can do this.

1261
01:25:09.16 --> 01:25:12.80
And so I convinced the they didn't have a raw machine in the physical therapy clinic at

1262
01:25:12.80 --> 01:25:13.80
the time.

1263
01:25:13.80 --> 01:25:15.84
They had an elliptical.

1264
01:25:15.84 --> 01:25:17.68
They had all sorts of equipment.

1265
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:19.24
They didn't have a raw machine.

1266
01:25:19.24 --> 01:25:28.08
So I convinced the clinic, whoever was running the clinic, to get a raw machine for me.

1267
01:25:28.08 --> 01:25:29.96
So I could row.

1268
01:25:29.96 --> 01:25:33.24
And then when I was trained for the nascent triathlon, I convinced them to let me bring my

1269
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:35.88
bike in and ride my bike in the clinic.

1270
01:25:35.88 --> 01:25:39.84
So I had my own, I started to build my own gym inside the gym.

1271
01:25:39.84 --> 01:25:45.52
And I convinced them to get a kettlebell for me and stuff.

1272
01:25:45.52 --> 01:25:50.12
And so I convinced them to let me have that raw machine.

1273
01:25:50.12 --> 01:25:54.04
And so a couple of times a week, I would go down to the water and train on the water.

1274
01:25:54.04 --> 01:26:00.12
The other times I would just do some sprints on the raw machine.

1275
01:26:00.12 --> 01:26:03.80
And then it just kind of kept getting better and better.

1276
01:26:03.80 --> 01:26:06.92
And this was 2011.

1277
01:26:06.92 --> 01:26:10.04
So then the parallel booster 2012.

1278
01:26:10.04 --> 01:26:15.48
And there was like a specific coach that runs the the raw machine.

1279
01:26:15.48 --> 01:26:16.48
Knowing team.

1280
01:26:16.48 --> 01:26:20.28
There isn't.

1281
01:26:20.28 --> 01:26:22.48
In some sports there are.

1282
01:26:22.48 --> 01:26:26.68
There's like there's a head coach that's in charge of everybody and I'll train everybody.

1283
01:26:26.68 --> 01:26:32.44
But for my category in parallel and big rowing, it's pretty much a finder on coach.

1284
01:26:32.44 --> 01:26:35.48
And you show up at this race.

1285
01:26:35.48 --> 01:26:39.64
And if you win that race, then you represent America and all their races for that year.

1286
01:26:39.64 --> 01:26:41.20
How far is the row?

1287
01:26:41.20 --> 01:26:42.60
It's a thousand meters.

1288
01:26:42.60 --> 01:26:49.08
So what does that like? It takes you a couple minutes, three minutes.

1289
01:26:49.08 --> 01:26:51.52
So rowing trunk and arms only.

1290
01:26:51.52 --> 01:26:53.64
It's my category.

1291
01:26:53.64 --> 01:27:02.000
So it would take me my best every time on the Urg was probably like 3.38 I think.

1292
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.20
And that's like puke level put now.

1293
01:27:04.20 --> 01:27:05.20
Yeah for me.

1294
01:27:05.20 --> 01:27:06.84
Yeah.

1295
01:27:06.84 --> 01:27:12.32
And then on the water the best in a double.

1296
01:27:12.32 --> 01:27:14.80
So two people.

1297
01:27:14.80 --> 01:27:19.88
My category you have to have two people in the boat was just right around four minutes.

1298
01:27:19.88 --> 01:27:23.56
If you could do four minutes, then you had a shot at winning.

1299
01:27:23.56 --> 01:27:24.88
And that's a thousand meters too.

1300
01:27:24.88 --> 01:27:26.08
It's a thousand meters.

1301
01:27:26.08 --> 01:27:27.60
So you're always going to be a little bit slower on the water.

1302
01:27:27.60 --> 01:27:29.40
And you say it's four minutes, you said?

1303
01:27:29.40 --> 01:27:31.16
Yeah about four minutes.

1304
01:27:31.16 --> 01:27:33.16
So it's like a complete gut check.

1305
01:27:33.16 --> 01:27:37.20
It's equivalent of sprinting like the mile.

1306
01:27:37.20 --> 01:27:38.20
Yeah.

1307
01:27:38.20 --> 01:27:39.20
Because you're going four minutes, right?

1308
01:27:39.20 --> 01:27:40.20
Four minutes mile.

1309
01:27:40.20 --> 01:27:42.20
I mean it's no joke.

1310
01:27:42.20 --> 01:27:44.60
It's a tough, tough race.

1311
01:27:44.60 --> 01:27:46.80
And where was the parallel and picks that year?

1312
01:27:46.80 --> 01:27:50.36
The parallel and picks were in London in 2012.

1313
01:27:50.36 --> 01:27:55.20
And so I was just getting ready for that.

1314
01:27:55.20 --> 01:27:56.20
I was getting ready to retire.

1315
01:27:56.20 --> 01:27:58.28
I need something to do too.

1316
01:27:58.28 --> 01:28:05.32
Just so happened that my coach at the time knew somebody else knew this, this other

1317
01:28:05.32 --> 01:28:09.64
coach that had a female that was looking for a partner.

1318
01:28:09.64 --> 01:28:12.24
Also a double above the knee and PT.

1319
01:28:12.24 --> 01:28:16.04
And so my boat class is one guy, one girl.

1320
01:28:16.04 --> 01:28:19.48
And so we met up, rode together.

1321
01:28:19.48 --> 01:28:21.48
Looks like we were a pretty good pair.

1322
01:28:21.48 --> 01:28:24.92
And once I retired, moved down to Florida.

1323
01:28:24.92 --> 01:28:27.04
Start training for the parallel and picks.

1324
01:28:27.04 --> 01:28:29.000
How long did you have to train?

1325
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.68
So I got out in the late December.

1326
01:28:33.68 --> 01:28:36.28
So let's say called January 1st.

1327
01:28:36.28 --> 01:28:45.96
And I, we had the parallel and the final September 2nd or September 3rd.

1328
01:28:45.96 --> 01:28:47.96
Okay, so you had a decent chunk of time.

1329
01:28:47.96 --> 01:28:50.96
About a good nine months of crushing yourself.

1330
01:28:50.96 --> 01:28:51.96
Of.

1331
01:28:51.96 --> 01:28:55.000
Yeah, training twice a day, every day.

1332
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.72
Or twice a day, six days a week, take off Sunday and just sprints, you know, technique,

1333
01:29:02.72 --> 01:29:04.72
a lot of technique.

1334
01:29:04.72 --> 01:29:05.72
Yeah.

1335
01:29:05.72 --> 01:29:07.72
Do you have to do the technique in the water?

1336
01:29:07.72 --> 01:29:08.72
Yeah.

1337
01:29:08.72 --> 01:29:12.36
I mean, you can do it outside of the water a little bit, but it's really, you got to practice

1338
01:29:12.36 --> 01:29:14.36
your technique in the water.

1339
01:29:14.36 --> 01:29:19.16
It's sure it's like, due to it, so you just got to, it doesn't matter if you're doing

1340
01:29:19.16 --> 01:29:25.36
like a, in a fake, fake scenario, you have, it doesn't really have the same effect unless

1341
01:29:25.36 --> 01:29:26.80
you're doing it in the real thing.

1342
01:29:26.80 --> 01:29:27.80
Yeah.

1343
01:29:27.80 --> 01:29:30.08
So you get to England and boom.

1344
01:29:30.08 --> 01:29:31.08
Yeah.

1345
01:29:31.08 --> 01:29:32.76
How many races is there in England?

1346
01:29:32.76 --> 01:29:34.08
Is it just one race?

1347
01:29:34.08 --> 01:29:35.08
No, luckily.

1348
01:29:35.08 --> 01:29:36.60
There's a couple of races.

1349
01:29:36.60 --> 01:29:38.08
So we had to do in the trials race.

1350
01:29:38.08 --> 01:29:39.08
Okay.

1351
01:29:39.08 --> 01:29:41.56
Which was to find out who represented America.

1352
01:29:41.56 --> 01:29:43.08
We won that.

1353
01:29:43.08 --> 01:29:47.96
Then we had to go qualify our boat for the parallel picks.

1354
01:29:47.96 --> 01:29:54.16
So we had to go to Serbia about maybe a month after winning the trials to qualify the

1355
01:29:54.16 --> 01:29:55.16
boats.

1356
01:29:55.16 --> 01:29:57.20
We won that race, qualify our boat.

1357
01:29:57.20 --> 01:30:03.40
And then parallel picks, you show up and you do your heat.

1358
01:30:03.40 --> 01:30:05.84
And then if you win that, he's, how many boats are in heat?

1359
01:30:05.84 --> 01:30:06.84
Oh, six.

1360
01:30:06.84 --> 01:30:07.84
Bang.

1361
01:30:07.84 --> 01:30:08.84
Okay.

1362
01:30:08.84 --> 01:30:09.84
There were 12 boats total.

1363
01:30:09.84 --> 01:30:11.72
Six in each heat to eight.

1364
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:14.48
So if you win that heat, you automatically go to the final.

1365
01:30:14.48 --> 01:30:18.72
If you don't win that heat, you gotta go what's called the repashage.

1366
01:30:18.72 --> 01:30:22.60
Stand for second chance in French.

1367
01:30:22.60 --> 01:30:26.08
And you have to come first or second in that.

1368
01:30:26.08 --> 01:30:27.08
So we won our repashage.

1369
01:30:27.08 --> 01:30:33.28
We lost our heat to the Chinese, which still makes me so mad.

1370
01:30:33.28 --> 01:30:35.88
And we won our repashage.

1371
01:30:35.88 --> 01:30:38.28
So we were in the final.

1372
01:30:38.28 --> 01:30:43.60
And we started the final and did last.

1373
01:30:43.60 --> 01:30:46.56
And just slowly over the course of the race.

1374
01:30:46.56 --> 01:30:47.56
This was our race plan.

1375
01:30:47.56 --> 01:30:50.36
We kind of wanted to start slow and build slowly.

1376
01:30:50.36 --> 01:30:54.20
We just rode in one boat and the next boat and the next boat.

1377
01:30:54.20 --> 01:30:56.72
Until we got to the end.

1378
01:30:56.72 --> 01:31:05.20
And we're about six inches between us and the great British boat, the home team.

1379
01:31:05.20 --> 01:31:08.64
Everybody's cheering for the home team.

1380
01:31:08.64 --> 01:31:11.28
And so third place gets a mental fourth place.

1381
01:31:11.28 --> 01:31:13.08
You don't get anything.

1382
01:31:13.08 --> 01:31:14.64
You get nothing.

1383
01:31:14.64 --> 01:31:15.64
Yeah.

1384
01:31:15.64 --> 01:31:20.36
So we're doing our final sprint and then we crossed the line.

1385
01:31:20.36 --> 01:31:21.92
And I don't know.

1386
01:31:21.92 --> 01:31:23.44
I wasn't looking over there.

1387
01:31:23.44 --> 01:31:25.20
My forums were numb.

1388
01:31:25.20 --> 01:31:27.96
I was just trying to hold onto the oars.

1389
01:31:27.96 --> 01:31:33.16
And then it comes up on this little board, you know, first place, China, second place

1390
01:31:33.16 --> 01:31:34.16
for France.

1391
01:31:34.16 --> 01:31:36.40
And then there's this is long.

1392
01:31:36.40 --> 01:31:45.32
And then it goes third place, USA and my mind.

1393
01:31:45.32 --> 01:31:46.80
And you look at the video.

1394
01:31:46.80 --> 01:31:49.52
It's literally like the length of one of these knives.

1395
01:31:49.52 --> 01:31:50.52
No kidding.

1396
01:31:50.52 --> 01:31:51.52
Yeah.

1397
01:31:51.52 --> 01:31:52.52
That close.

1398
01:31:52.52 --> 01:31:56.12
Point two, point two seconds between them and us.

1399
01:31:56.12 --> 01:31:57.12
That's crazy.

1400
01:31:57.12 --> 01:32:02.000
So, did you meet anyone while you're on that event?

1401
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I'm sorry.

1402
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Yes, I did.

1403
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.64
You're telling the events of whatever.

1404
01:32:05.64 --> 01:32:06.64
You're about to go.

1405
01:32:06.64 --> 01:32:08.64
Oh, well.

1406
01:32:08.64 --> 01:32:16.68
So I'll tell you when we were first got there and we were training.

1407
01:32:16.68 --> 01:32:17.96
We were doing, we would go out.

1408
01:32:17.96 --> 01:32:19.52
We would probably there a good week beforehand.

1409
01:32:19.52 --> 01:32:23.40
So we'd go out and train on the lake and continue our training and get used to the

1410
01:32:23.40 --> 01:32:24.40
area.

1411
01:32:24.40 --> 01:32:29.36
My partner, my rowing partner and I were watching the other teams.

1412
01:32:29.36 --> 01:32:31.88
And then there's another boat class called the four.

1413
01:32:31.88 --> 01:32:34.60
So it's four people.

1414
01:32:34.60 --> 01:32:39.16
And I saw this great British four row by.

1415
01:32:39.16 --> 01:32:45.72
And there was this gorgeous blonde in the bow of the four.

1416
01:32:45.72 --> 01:32:48.92
And I said, I just bit my lip.

1417
01:32:48.92 --> 01:32:54.84
That's a good looking check.

1418
01:32:54.84 --> 01:32:59.44
And I never expected to meet her anything because we're not racing against each other.

1419
01:32:59.44 --> 01:33:00.72
She's from another team.

1420
01:33:00.72 --> 01:33:04.08
And you kind of, until the race is over, you've got to be.

1421
01:33:04.08 --> 01:33:05.08
Keep in it professional.

1422
01:33:05.08 --> 01:33:06.08
Sure.

1423
01:33:06.08 --> 01:33:10.40
She even though she was super high and she was very high.

1424
01:33:10.40 --> 01:33:19.04
But you know, and she, she, she'll tell me back when she told me, well, she saw me

1425
01:33:19.04 --> 01:33:20.04
around.

1426
01:33:20.04 --> 01:33:23.08
I was like, because I was in the out was this in serious Marine Corps mode.

1427
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:24.08
Just don't talk to anybody.

1428
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:25.08
Yeah, I was the take.

1429
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:26.08
Yeah.

1430
01:33:26.08 --> 01:33:27.08
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:33:27.08 --> 01:33:32.08
And so racing's over.

1432
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:33.48
We're back in the athletes village.

1433
01:33:33.48 --> 01:33:36.32
It's time to get after it.

1434
01:33:36.32 --> 01:33:38.72
The other kind of getting after it.

1435
01:33:38.72 --> 01:33:41.12
There's a casino outside the athletes village.

1436
01:33:41.12 --> 01:33:45.08
So the American contingent goes out to this casino.

1437
01:33:45.08 --> 01:33:46.08
Starts.

1438
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:48.84
We're part, I'm still at this point.

1439
01:33:48.84 --> 01:33:53.32
I'm still kind of in like serious mode takes a couple days to get out of it.

1440
01:33:53.32 --> 01:33:56.68
You know, serious, serious mode.

1441
01:33:56.68 --> 01:33:58.52
Still a little bit pissed that we lost.

1442
01:33:58.52 --> 01:34:00.48
You know, to China and France.

1443
01:34:00.48 --> 01:34:06.44
The two people, the two countries that my buddies like don't lose the China or

1444
01:34:06.44 --> 01:34:08.44
France.

1445
01:34:08.44 --> 01:34:10.16
They were taking shots like every two fit.

1446
01:34:10.16 --> 01:34:12.44
They were following on at home and they could be doing it.

1447
01:34:12.44 --> 01:34:19.32
They were like, they were like, they were like, they woke up like so early in the morning.

1448
01:34:19.32 --> 01:34:20.32
So we're out there.

1449
01:34:20.32 --> 01:34:24.20
Then the British team comes in for the just one goal, right?

1450
01:34:24.20 --> 01:34:26.16
And they're all, they're all happy.

1451
01:34:26.16 --> 01:34:29.60
So we're the only two groups that speak English.

1452
01:34:29.60 --> 01:34:30.60
Right.

1453
01:34:30.60 --> 01:34:31.60
So, yeah.

1454
01:34:31.60 --> 01:34:36.60
So our two groups kind of end up together.

1455
01:34:36.60 --> 01:34:41.60
It took a while to get me to out of my shell.

1456
01:34:41.60 --> 01:34:42.60
Yeah.

1457
01:34:42.60 --> 01:34:45.60
Because I was like, you know, still kind of on my guard.

1458
01:34:45.60 --> 01:34:50.60
This is the first, maybe the second time I'd ever traveled outside of America for anything

1459
01:34:50.60 --> 01:34:51.60
besides deployments.

1460
01:34:51.60 --> 01:34:52.60
Yeah.

1461
01:34:52.60 --> 01:34:53.60
I'd never traveled outside of America.

1462
01:34:53.60 --> 01:34:56.60
Serbia was the first time England was the second time.

1463
01:34:56.60 --> 01:35:00.92
It was kind of still on my guard a little bit.

1464
01:35:00.92 --> 01:35:08.28
But they started feeding me fosters, lightened up and then just so happened the gorgeous

1465
01:35:08.28 --> 01:35:09.76
blonde I saw was there.

1466
01:35:09.76 --> 01:35:13.52
So, hey, you guys know how charming I am.

1467
01:35:13.52 --> 01:35:14.52
Charmider?

1468
01:35:14.52 --> 01:35:16.52
Well, you at least will die.

1469
01:35:16.52 --> 01:35:19.96
So I'm sure the alcohol helped.

1470
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:22.96
You know, but Charmider and now we're married.

1471
01:35:22.96 --> 01:35:24.96
So that's all.

1472
01:35:24.96 --> 01:35:28.44
After four years of long distance relationship, because she kept rowing.

1473
01:35:28.44 --> 01:35:31.24
She actually defended her gold medal in Rio.

1474
01:35:31.24 --> 01:35:32.24
And did it again?

1475
01:35:32.24 --> 01:35:33.24
Yeah.

1476
01:35:33.24 --> 01:35:34.24
Got gold again.

1477
01:35:34.24 --> 01:35:36.64
So we did about, we didn't get together right away.

1478
01:35:36.64 --> 01:35:40.52
We did long distance for about three years.

1479
01:35:40.52 --> 01:35:41.52
She lived in England.

1480
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:43.24
I was living in America.

1481
01:35:43.24 --> 01:35:44.72
But finally got her over here.

1482
01:35:44.72 --> 01:35:45.72
Married.

1483
01:35:45.72 --> 01:35:46.72
My name's Pam.

1484
01:35:46.72 --> 01:35:47.72
Nice.

1485
01:35:47.72 --> 01:35:48.72
Okay.

1486
01:35:48.72 --> 01:35:52.28
Well, obviously I have a certain affinity for British ladies as well.

1487
01:35:52.28 --> 01:35:54.92
Pretty well known.

1488
01:35:54.92 --> 01:35:59.24
Now, you mentioned real quickly you were training for triathlon and there somewhere

1489
01:35:59.24 --> 01:36:00.24
too.

1490
01:36:00.24 --> 01:36:01.24
Yeah.

1491
01:36:01.24 --> 01:36:08.000
So the people at the clinic, it was a team effort.

1492
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Everybody.

1493
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.64
So they were other amputees in there.

1494
01:36:13.64 --> 01:36:17.40
I mean, we talked about this little yesterday, Dan Kinnosen, Navy SEAL.

1495
01:36:17.40 --> 01:36:18.64
That was there for a year.

1496
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:19.64
Awesome guy.

1497
01:36:19.64 --> 01:36:20.64
But for me.

1498
01:36:20.64 --> 01:36:22.24
And and Perlampine as well.

1499
01:36:22.24 --> 01:36:23.24
Yeah.

1500
01:36:23.24 --> 01:36:25.96
Perlampine in the by-ath one.

1501
01:36:25.96 --> 01:36:33.08
He was my idol, I guess, for when I first got there.

1502
01:36:33.08 --> 01:36:35.32
Because he was pretty much done with therapy.

1503
01:36:35.32 --> 01:36:36.32
He was about to get out.

1504
01:36:36.32 --> 01:36:39.56
He was walking everywhere on his legs, carrying backpack around.

1505
01:36:39.56 --> 01:36:43.16
And he was almost, I mean, these axioms injuries you.

1506
01:36:43.16 --> 01:36:44.16
I mean, just above the knee.

1507
01:36:44.16 --> 01:36:46.000
I'm a little bit of an angel.

1508
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Yeah.

1509
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
So I could see him from when I was just sitting in a wheelchair.

1510
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Right.

1511
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.88
And that is possible.

1512
01:36:53.88 --> 01:36:55.80
Because I'm seeing it with my own device.

1513
01:36:55.80 --> 01:36:57.40
It is possible.

1514
01:36:57.40 --> 01:36:58.40
And so.

1515
01:36:58.40 --> 01:36:59.80
And he's a stud.

1516
01:36:59.80 --> 01:37:00.80
Yeah.

1517
01:37:00.80 --> 01:37:04.36
So if you want to try and be like anybody, it's be like Dan.

1518
01:37:04.36 --> 01:37:04.36
Yeah.

1519
01:37:04.36 --> 01:37:06.96
Because.

1520
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:11.96
And so that's kind of the the environment that they had there at Walter Reed was.

1521
01:37:11.96 --> 01:37:17.52
You could ask somebody that had been there before tips, tricks, anything like that.

1522
01:37:17.52 --> 01:37:23.80
And so I saw Dan and I was asking him stuff and watching how he did stuff.

1523
01:37:23.80 --> 01:37:25.64
And then eventually he left.

1524
01:37:25.64 --> 01:37:27.84
And I kind of noticed, you know, I am now.

1525
01:37:27.84 --> 01:37:28.84
There's new guys coming in.

1526
01:37:28.84 --> 01:37:29.84
Yeah.

1527
01:37:29.84 --> 01:37:32.04
I'm now that person that has been there.

1528
01:37:32.04 --> 01:37:37.76
And so I need to step into that role and offer advice and work harder than anybody else

1529
01:37:37.76 --> 01:37:42.76
in the clinic and show people what's going on and show people what's possible.

1530
01:37:42.76 --> 01:37:50.48
And so the therapist would always be, who wants to run the army 10 mile or who wants to

1531
01:37:50.48 --> 01:37:51.48
do this triathlon.

1532
01:37:51.48 --> 01:37:52.48
They'd always be getting offered.

1533
01:37:52.48 --> 01:37:57.08
They'd be getting slots and races because people love having wind of warriors out there.

1534
01:37:57.08 --> 01:37:58.40
So they make a big deal.

1535
01:37:58.40 --> 01:38:01.32
And they get let them go off first and everything.

1536
01:38:01.32 --> 01:38:03.32
So yeah.

1537
01:38:03.32 --> 01:38:07.68
And every time they ask me if I could, if I wasn't doing anything else at day, be like, yeah,

1538
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:09.20
I'll do it.

1539
01:38:09.20 --> 01:38:13.000
And so they're like, you want to do the nation triathlon.

1540
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.08
It's a Olympic distance triathlon.

1541
01:38:16.08 --> 01:38:18.20
And there's like two people doing it.

1542
01:38:18.20 --> 01:38:21.28
And no other, it's like a single blow the knee and P.D.

1543
01:38:21.28 --> 01:38:22.28
Do it.

1544
01:38:22.28 --> 01:38:23.28
And that's it.

1545
01:38:23.28 --> 01:38:24.72
And you're a double above knee after you want to do it.

1546
01:38:24.72 --> 01:38:25.72
Yeah.

1547
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:26.72
I do.

1548
01:38:26.72 --> 01:38:31.24
And it's just because it just so happened at the time I was learning how to ride a bicycle

1549
01:38:31.24 --> 01:38:32.64
again, normal bicycle.

1550
01:38:32.64 --> 01:38:34.84
So you're learning how to ride a bike.

1551
01:38:34.84 --> 01:38:35.84
Might as well do a triathlon.

1552
01:38:35.84 --> 01:38:36.84
Exactly.

1553
01:38:36.84 --> 01:38:38.84
Hey, you got to give.

1554
01:38:38.84 --> 01:38:44.64
One of the things that's going to drive you to push yourself is having skin in the

1555
01:38:44.64 --> 01:38:47.76
game, having something to lose, having something to risk.

1556
01:38:47.76 --> 01:38:53.24
So if you say to everybody in the clinic, I'm going to do the nation triathlon.

1557
01:38:53.24 --> 01:38:54.24
And you don't do it.

1558
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:55.24
You're an idiot.

1559
01:38:55.24 --> 01:38:57.48
You're a loser.

1560
01:38:57.48 --> 01:39:00.48
How long is a Olympic triathlon?

1561
01:39:00.48 --> 01:39:02.64
Well, Olympic distance.

1562
01:39:02.64 --> 01:39:09.64
The swim is 1500 meters.

1563
01:39:09.64 --> 01:39:10.88
The bike is 40 kilometers.

1564
01:39:10.88 --> 01:39:13.44
And the run is 10 kilometers.

1565
01:39:13.44 --> 01:39:14.44
Exactly.

1566
01:39:14.44 --> 01:39:18.88
Luckily for me, because I wasn't that good at swimming, luckily for me the swim got canceled

1567
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:23.52
that year because there was a huge storm as a ton of debris in the Potomac.

1568
01:39:23.52 --> 01:39:27.96
So we didn't do the swim, but we did the bike and the run.

1569
01:39:27.96 --> 01:39:31.04
And yeah, so I was, I was, I was relearned and how to ride a bicycle.

1570
01:39:31.04 --> 01:39:34.96
Nobody had ever done that before in the history of Walter Reed, double the brother knee

1571
01:39:34.96 --> 01:39:37.92
and BT trying to ride a bicycle.

1572
01:39:37.92 --> 01:39:38.92
And I had figured it out.

1573
01:39:38.92 --> 01:39:40.28
And I kind of wanted to put it to use.

1574
01:39:40.28 --> 01:39:44.36
You know, like, I've finally figured this thing out.

1575
01:39:44.36 --> 01:39:49.28
And so, oh, what better way to do it than do the nation triathlon?

1576
01:39:49.28 --> 01:39:55.48
And so it was like, you know, a bat tip is a bit of a fire in a way.

1577
01:39:55.48 --> 01:39:59.12
And so it took me like four hours to do the whole thing.

1578
01:39:59.12 --> 01:40:01.96
Did you enjoy it?

1579
01:40:01.96 --> 01:40:03.36
I enjoyed having done it.

1580
01:40:03.36 --> 01:40:04.36
Okay.

1581
01:40:04.36 --> 01:40:08.40
Because I'm just wondering at what point you made the brilliant decision that you were

1582
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:12.64
going to ride a freaking bicycle across the United States of America?

1583
01:40:12.64 --> 01:40:17.92
Well, which was your next, whatever, freaking psychotic idea you got.

1584
01:40:17.92 --> 01:40:21.08
Again, where did that come from?

1585
01:40:21.08 --> 01:40:22.72
I had just learned how to ride the bike.

1586
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:25.88
And I'm going, I got to do something with it.

1587
01:40:25.88 --> 01:40:29.56
I can't make it just this pointless that I learned how OK I did it now.

1588
01:40:29.56 --> 01:40:31.76
Never going to do it again.

1589
01:40:31.76 --> 01:40:34.84
I was like, you know what might be fun is just like riding my bike across the country.

1590
01:40:34.84 --> 01:40:36.76
It's on point in my life.

1591
01:40:36.76 --> 01:40:39.24
And this is when I have, I'm not even, I'm still in the hospital.

1592
01:40:39.24 --> 01:40:41.48
I just learned how to ride the bike.

1593
01:40:41.48 --> 01:40:44.000
I should do something like ride my bike across countries.

1594
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.44
I might not be.

1595
01:40:45.44 --> 01:40:48.64
You know, something cool like that.

1596
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:51.08
And I was wrong.

1597
01:40:51.08 --> 01:40:53.92
I didn't do it right because I had made the commitment to do the rowing.

1598
01:40:53.92 --> 01:40:54.92
Right.

1599
01:40:54.92 --> 01:40:59.16
But eventually I will do this cross country bike ride.

1600
01:40:59.16 --> 01:41:01.72
And so I did another year of rowing after that.

1601
01:41:01.72 --> 01:41:06.32
I took the time to kind of plan it out how I wanted to do it.

1602
01:41:06.32 --> 01:41:11.44
And so I took another year of rowing and then finished world championships that year and

1603
01:41:11.44 --> 01:41:15.44
fourth.

1604
01:41:15.44 --> 01:41:20.68
And about a month later, drove up to Maine started riding.

1605
01:41:20.68 --> 01:41:22.40
This is an October.

1606
01:41:22.40 --> 01:41:23.40
And so what was that?

1607
01:41:23.40 --> 01:41:24.40
What was that all?

1608
01:41:24.40 --> 01:41:28.08
What was the, what did that day to day look like?

1609
01:41:28.08 --> 01:41:34.24
So I had a box truck, a U-haul box truck I bought.

1610
01:41:34.24 --> 01:41:37.72
Like I used 200,000 miles U-haul box truck.

1611
01:41:37.72 --> 01:41:38.72
Check.

1612
01:41:38.72 --> 01:41:42.32
I laid down some carpets in the back.

1613
01:41:42.32 --> 01:41:43.32
Check.

1614
01:41:43.32 --> 01:41:48.28
Um, had a couple of cuts, couple sleeping bags, some lines.

1615
01:41:48.28 --> 01:41:51.36
And my little brother who was about to turn 18.

1616
01:41:51.36 --> 01:41:52.36
Check.

1617
01:41:52.36 --> 01:41:54.08
Uh, Rogered up to drive.

1618
01:41:54.08 --> 01:41:55.08
Good to go.

1619
01:41:55.08 --> 01:41:56.24
That's all you need right there.

1620
01:41:56.24 --> 01:42:01.56
Box truck, water, two cuts, carpet, and a little brother.

1621
01:42:01.56 --> 01:42:05.04
And so, you know, I didn't really train much.

1622
01:42:05.04 --> 01:42:09.20
What I did was I made sure that my prosthetics fit correctly.

1623
01:42:09.20 --> 01:42:10.20
And I was able to ride the bike.

1624
01:42:10.20 --> 01:42:11.24
That's all I really did.

1625
01:42:11.24 --> 01:42:14.92
I didn't, you know, go out and ride 100 miles or anything.

1626
01:42:14.92 --> 01:42:16.84
And you kind of formal training for it.

1627
01:42:16.84 --> 01:42:17.84
Yeah.

1628
01:42:17.84 --> 01:42:19.32
Because I figured what is the point?

1629
01:42:19.32 --> 01:42:20.32
Yeah.

1630
01:42:20.32 --> 01:42:21.32
Exactly.

1631
01:42:21.32 --> 01:42:24.08
And that beginning is the training for the finish.

1632
01:42:24.08 --> 01:42:25.08
Yeah.

1633
01:42:25.08 --> 01:42:34.20
So the day the day would be wake up, probably six, seven o'clock.

1634
01:42:34.20 --> 01:42:36.80
You know, drive out to wherever I was starting for the day.

1635
01:42:36.80 --> 01:42:39.36
Because you couldn't, you can't just like stop and then pull over.

1636
01:42:39.36 --> 01:42:44.12
So we'd have to like drive the truck somewhere, park it in a church parking lot or a fire

1637
01:42:44.12 --> 01:42:46.56
department parking lot.

1638
01:42:46.56 --> 01:42:48.56
And then uh, sorry.

1639
01:42:48.56 --> 01:42:50.56
Don't get apprehended by the cops.

1640
01:42:50.56 --> 01:42:56.64
So the first time, so I had, I was, I'd be riding my bike and then my brother would be

1641
01:42:56.64 --> 01:42:58.56
kind of half on half off the road.

1642
01:42:58.56 --> 01:43:04.12
And I picked a route that we didn't have, you know, not super busy roads.

1643
01:43:04.12 --> 01:43:07.16
So I wouldn't get in too many people's way until I got the Pacific Coast highway and

1644
01:43:07.16 --> 01:43:09.80
then people were super pissed.

1645
01:43:09.80 --> 01:43:16.76
And uh, at one point this cop, the first cop I encountered pulls over in front of us and

1646
01:43:16.76 --> 01:43:21.56
like, all right, here we go. He's going to tell me to stop the rides over and then he

1647
01:43:21.56 --> 01:43:24.56
gets out and he's like, I just want to shake your hand, man.

1648
01:43:24.56 --> 01:43:25.56
It's like, fhew.

1649
01:43:25.56 --> 01:43:26.56
Okay.

1650
01:43:26.56 --> 01:43:27.56
This is how it's going to go.

1651
01:43:27.56 --> 01:43:30.92
This is something so I'm going to get the cops love me.

1652
01:43:30.92 --> 01:43:35.68
Um, and so I wake up, start riding, probably around 738.

1653
01:43:35.68 --> 01:43:37.32
I might eat breakfast beforehand.

1654
01:43:37.32 --> 01:43:39.52
Um, probably ride.

1655
01:43:39.52 --> 01:43:43.52
Yeah, I would do 30 miles a day.

1656
01:43:43.52 --> 01:43:47.76
So I just break that up however I felt for the day, take breaks, hop in the back of the

1657
01:43:47.76 --> 01:43:53.68
trucks, sit around for a while and run, I'd ride 30 miles and then wherever I finished

1658
01:43:53.68 --> 01:43:58.88
30 miles, I might go a little bit further for a better pulling off point, stop getting

1659
01:43:58.88 --> 01:44:05.40
the truck, drive off to wherever we might be able to park the truck and then spend the

1660
01:44:05.40 --> 01:44:13.44
night in the truck and then, uh, drive back out to that spot the next day, do it again.

1661
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:20.12
Luckily for me, a lot of hotels started to offer us nights to sleep.

1662
01:44:20.12 --> 01:44:23.92
So we really on this sleep in the truck for the first month, then after that we were mostly

1663
01:44:23.92 --> 01:44:24.92
in hotels.

1664
01:44:24.92 --> 01:44:27.24
And this was like a six month journey.

1665
01:44:27.24 --> 01:44:29.52
Six month, October to April.

1666
01:44:29.52 --> 01:44:31.96
So I was, you did it through the winter time.

1667
01:44:31.96 --> 01:44:32.96
Yeah.

1668
01:44:32.96 --> 01:44:33.96
You ever heard of the polar vortex?

1669
01:44:33.96 --> 01:44:34.96
Uh, yeah.

1670
01:44:34.96 --> 01:44:35.96
Yeah.

1671
01:44:35.96 --> 01:44:36.96
No, no, what is this?

1672
01:44:36.96 --> 01:44:37.96
There's polar vortex here.

1673
01:44:37.96 --> 01:44:45.28
Freezing temperatures that came down and like attacked the nation with cold.

1674
01:44:45.28 --> 01:44:46.60
They called the polar vortex.

1675
01:44:46.60 --> 01:44:47.60
Yeah.

1676
01:44:47.60 --> 01:44:48.60
It sounded very fresh.

1677
01:44:48.60 --> 01:44:51.48
It's one step higher than the shark NATO.

1678
01:44:51.48 --> 01:45:03.92
Uh, 5,180 miles in the winter time every day for 180 days.

1679
01:45:03.92 --> 01:45:09.44
Talk about fortitude in your journal and I'm going to read it.

1680
01:45:09.44 --> 01:45:13.92
It was through, it was through the true purpose of the Marine Corps that I became what

1681
01:45:13.92 --> 01:45:15.56
I am today.

1682
01:45:15.56 --> 01:45:18.48
And it is that, it is that.

1683
01:45:18.48 --> 01:45:24.44
And that is the act of fighting the battles of the United States.

1684
01:45:24.44 --> 01:45:30.36
It is through the preparation for and the fighting of America's wars that Marines gain

1685
01:45:30.36 --> 01:45:38.28
their fine edge and an idea of the true meaning of courage, spirit, tenacity, altruism,

1686
01:45:38.28 --> 01:45:40.76
and brotherhood.

1687
01:45:40.76 --> 01:45:44.96
After having been imbued with the essential qualities described to Marines in boot camp,

1688
01:45:44.96 --> 01:45:49.92
it is up to the individual Marine and his leadership all the way from the fire team leader

1689
01:45:49.92 --> 01:45:55.40
to the common don to make him the ideal tool for the core.

1690
01:45:55.40 --> 01:45:59.32
And there's no better place than a war to do this.

1691
01:45:59.32 --> 01:46:03.76
It was during my two deployments that I learned what it means to be courageous.

1692
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:09.16
Almost on a daily basis, my fellow Marines and I would be subjected to situations with high

1693
01:46:09.16 --> 01:46:16.12
potential for danger and situations with infinite, unknowable, possible outcomes.

1694
01:46:16.12 --> 01:46:21.08
The dangerous and unpredictable nature of these conditions lists its fear, nervousness,

1695
01:46:21.08 --> 01:46:24.84
and uncertainty in all people.

1696
01:46:24.84 --> 01:46:32.48
However, without fail, when the time came to strap on our gear and proceed forth into these

1697
01:46:32.48 --> 01:46:40.16
conditions, we did it with no hesitation because it was what we needed to do.

1698
01:46:40.16 --> 01:46:44.04
To me, that is courage.

1699
01:46:44.04 --> 01:46:50.16
I learned it from the example set by my leaders and my compatriots and when it was my turn,

1700
01:46:50.16 --> 01:46:55.56
I endeavored to teach others by my own example.

1701
01:46:55.56 --> 01:47:02.28
My favorite among the many mantras of the Marine Corps is adapt and overcome.

1702
01:47:02.28 --> 01:47:07.20
It is my favorite because it embodies the spirit and tenacity that Marines must possess

1703
01:47:07.20 --> 01:47:11.76
in order to be the world's greatest war fighting force.

1704
01:47:11.76 --> 01:47:16.76
To Marines, accomplishment of their mission is of the utmost importance.

1705
01:47:16.76 --> 01:47:24.36
Above that of their own lives and the ability to adapt and overcome is key.

1706
01:47:24.36 --> 01:47:27.64
The idea is straightforward.

1707
01:47:27.64 --> 01:47:36.20
Change whatever you need to in order to become what is required to transcend an obstacle.

1708
01:47:36.20 --> 01:47:40.76
If there is no bridge over a river, a Marine will swim.

1709
01:47:40.76 --> 01:47:44.56
If there is a wall in front of us, we will blow it apart.

1710
01:47:44.56 --> 01:47:50.44
If there is an enemy on a hill that we want, we will remove him.

1711
01:47:50.44 --> 01:47:53.92
Marines do not stop until they have accomplished their mission.

1712
01:47:53.92 --> 01:47:59.16
Regardless of any monkey wrench that gets thrown into their plan, they will change their

1713
01:47:59.16 --> 01:48:07.52
plan a thousand times if it need be until what needs to be done is done.

1714
01:48:07.52 --> 01:48:11.000
And then they will move on to the next mission.

1715
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.84
It was these two qualities that kept me that allowed me to keep fighting after I was wounded.

1716
01:48:17.84 --> 01:48:22.48
My plan of accomplishing something with my life and making my life as good as possible

1717
01:48:22.48 --> 01:48:26.48
was met with obstacles and monkey wrenches.

1718
01:48:26.48 --> 01:48:32.80
But since I had already learned these lessons, bypassing these obstacles and moving on

1719
01:48:32.80 --> 01:48:37.12
was easy and natural.

1720
01:48:37.12 --> 01:48:42.12
The brotherhood that the Marines share is the defining feature that initially attracted

1721
01:48:42.12 --> 01:48:43.92
me to the Marine Corps.

1722
01:48:43.92 --> 01:48:49.36
And over the course of two deployments, I experienced it to its fullness.

1723
01:48:49.36 --> 01:48:53.40
The reason that I was able to be courageous and adapt and overcome was because the men

1724
01:48:53.40 --> 01:48:57.80
that stood beside me doing the same thing.

1725
01:48:57.80 --> 01:49:03.64
And it is because we were experiencing war and hardship together that we grew close enough

1726
01:49:03.64 --> 01:49:09.000
that I cared for them more than I cared for myself.

1727
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:17.92
And which sacrificed my safety for their well-being even if it meant being extinguished.

1728
01:49:17.92 --> 01:49:26.04
And although it never needed to be said, I knew this was reciprocated.

1729
01:49:26.04 --> 01:49:31.60
To me, this is the definition of brotherhood and selflessness.

1730
01:49:31.60 --> 01:49:38.32
But from my having been part of such a relationship is why I am loyal and put others before

1731
01:49:38.32 --> 01:49:47.04
myself as if it were a default setting.

1732
01:49:47.04 --> 01:49:52.68
Without the Marine Corps, I have no idea where I would be or what I would be like.

1733
01:49:52.68 --> 01:50:01.12
All I can say for sure is that I am what I am now doing large part to what I was

1734
01:50:01.12 --> 01:50:08.12
taught and what I experienced during my five years in the Marine Corps.

1735
01:50:15.40 --> 01:50:17.60
Yeah, awesome.

1736
01:50:17.60 --> 01:50:29.08
If there's anything that the Marine Corps teaches you, it is brotherhood, it is endurance,

1737
01:50:29.08 --> 01:50:36.08
how to endure situations you don't want to have to be in.

1738
01:50:37.52 --> 01:50:45.08
Whether it is a humping around with a pack or fighting in Afghanistan or if it is sitting

1739
01:50:45.08 --> 01:50:48.78
in the back of a seven-ton get and drenched in rain and then having to set up a 10-blog

1740
01:50:48.78 --> 01:50:50.78
blah blah blah.

1741
01:50:50.78 --> 01:50:52.08
It teaches you those things.

1742
01:50:52.08 --> 01:50:56.08
And so I already knew all this stuff.

1743
01:50:56.08 --> 01:51:04.08
I was good at it by the time I became an amputee and then I got even better at it.

1744
01:51:04.08 --> 01:51:10.24
Once I was an amputee, even more experience and then so that led into being able to endure

1745
01:51:10.24 --> 01:51:13.68
whatever I had to for the bike ride.

1746
01:51:13.68 --> 01:51:20.08
And I think the slogan for the wounded warrior regiment in the Marine Corps is, I don't

1747
01:51:20.08 --> 01:51:23.08
know if this is it's lad and I don't know if it's pronounced in a right.

1748
01:51:23.08 --> 01:51:28.08
I'm in Pugna which is still in the fight.

1749
01:51:28.08 --> 01:51:38.08
And you know, I'm not still in the main fight that's going on in Iraq, Afghanistan.

1750
01:51:38.08 --> 01:51:46.08
I've been taken out of that fight, but the overall fight, I'm still in that.

1751
01:51:46.08 --> 01:51:49.08
I'm still a representative of America.

1752
01:51:49.08 --> 01:51:52.08
I'm still representative of Marines.

1753
01:51:52.08 --> 01:51:59.08
I'm still dedicating myself to help my brothers that are struggling or come back wounded.

1754
01:51:59.08 --> 01:52:03.08
I'm still in that portion of the fight.

1755
01:52:03.08 --> 01:52:10.08
And I mean, just remember, you just have to remember that that slogan to stay stay in the fight.

1756
01:52:10.08 --> 01:52:13.08
Just keep fighting.

1757
01:52:13.08 --> 01:52:23.08
Where obviously you're staying in the fight and I, you know, I get again, reading through your journal stuff is awesome.

1758
01:52:23.08 --> 01:52:27.08
And there's a bunch of different things that I wanted to pull out.

1759
01:52:27.08 --> 01:52:29.08
And obviously I can't read the whole damn thing.

1760
01:52:29.08 --> 01:52:32.08
Maybe I could, but I'll read that for you.

1761
01:52:32.08 --> 01:52:38.08
But one of the things, you know, I'm always thinking that what, you know, what can I pull out?

1762
01:52:38.08 --> 01:52:41.08
That I think will be really helpful to other people.

1763
01:52:41.08 --> 01:52:48.08
I thought that this thing that you wrote right here was just something that can be used by anybody,

1764
01:52:48.08 --> 01:52:55.08
especially people that are facing tough situations, which as you just mentioned,

1765
01:52:55.08 --> 01:52:59.08
you are pretty dang good at dealing with tough situations.

1766
01:52:59.08 --> 01:53:01.08
And I think this gives a little insight into that.

1767
01:53:01.08 --> 01:53:04.08
So here we go, back to your journal.

1768
01:53:04.08 --> 01:53:10.08
The Kubler Ross model explains the stages by which an individual grieves for a lost intimate.

1769
01:53:10.08 --> 01:53:15.08
The five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

1770
01:53:15.08 --> 01:53:20.08
In this case, it could be said I was grieving for myself.

1771
01:53:20.08 --> 01:53:24.08
The former me that had died in Sangin.

1772
01:53:24.08 --> 01:53:33.08
Since I had a natural understanding of conservation of energy and an awareness of the time required to reach my goal,

1773
01:53:33.08 --> 01:53:39.08
I instinctively skipped the first four steps and proceeded the acceptance portion of the process.

1774
01:53:39.08 --> 01:53:50.08
I had decided that to spend my limited energy resources on denial, anger, bargaining, and depression would be a pointless waste,

1775
01:53:50.08 --> 01:53:54.08
and would be better left off of my itinerary.

1776
01:53:54.08 --> 01:53:59.08
I wanted to be able to expend as much energy as I could toward my goal,

1777
01:53:59.08 --> 01:54:05.08
which would not only allow me to reach it faster, but would improve the quality of my success.

1778
01:54:05.08 --> 01:54:12.08
The sooner I had accepted my situation, the sooner I could get to where I wanted to be.

1779
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:20.08
Having one's legs amputated above the knee is categorically a negative experience.

1780
01:54:20.08 --> 01:54:29.08
If I hadn't had the right mindset afterward, the rest of my life could have also become a negative experience.

1781
01:54:29.08 --> 01:54:44.08
Fortunately, I was able to react to the loss by accepting the negative energy from that occurrence and using it to open doors for myself in order to be sure that my life would remain a positive experience.

1782
01:54:44.08 --> 01:54:52.08
No matter who you are, whether you are healthy or ill, injured or able bodied,

1783
01:54:52.08 --> 01:54:57.08
everyone's main purpose in life is to make it as good as possible.

1784
01:54:57.08 --> 01:55:03.08
This is an unchanging objective for all people no matter what happens.

1785
01:55:03.08 --> 01:55:12.08
Thus, now that I was a double above the knee amp-UT, I needed to figure out a way to keep my life enjoyable.

1786
01:55:12.08 --> 01:55:19.08
With this in mind, I researched the Paralympics to see if I could participate, which led to a bronze medal at the 2012 Games.

1787
01:55:19.08 --> 01:55:26.08
Not only that, I accepted people into my life who have enriched it beyond what I could have imagined.

1788
01:55:26.08 --> 01:55:33.08
From the experiences associated with sports, I have learned lessons that have and will continue to make me a better person.

1789
01:55:33.08 --> 01:55:38.08
Lessons that I can pass on to others in the future.

1790
01:55:38.08 --> 01:55:53.08
It was in this way that I was able to transform the negative experience of having lost the lower part of my legs into the positive experience and energy of participating in a sport and all that has accompanied it.

1791
01:55:53.08 --> 01:56:01.08
If you are ill or injured, use it as a way to discover a new hobby or career.

1792
01:56:01.08 --> 01:56:08.08
If someone is rude to you and makes you angry, use the anger to fuel a workout.

1793
01:56:08.08 --> 01:56:18.08
If someone you know has a terminal illness, use it as an opportunity to make a difference in their life and in the world.

1794
01:56:18.08 --> 01:56:31.08
The most important part of transforming energy from negative to positive is being aware of opportunities as they are presented and having the courage to seize them.

1795
01:56:31.08 --> 01:56:37.08
Energy is all around us, constantly fueling and transforming.

1796
01:56:37.08 --> 01:56:42.08
It will affect us in ways we cannot predict.

1797
01:56:42.08 --> 01:56:52.08
Be a person that uses energy intelligently instead of wasting it.

1798
01:56:52.08 --> 01:56:58.08
I like to say, use the weight and I kind of analogize it.

1799
01:56:58.08 --> 01:57:00.08
I like lift weights.

1800
01:57:00.08 --> 01:57:07.08
I like to analogize it with maybe a strict press.

1801
01:57:07.08 --> 01:57:12.08
The weight on the bar is whatever.

1802
01:57:12.08 --> 01:57:15.08
Grow from broke up with you, whatever.

1803
01:57:15.08 --> 01:57:17.08
Possibly issue you're having.

1804
01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:20.08
You can hold that bar on your shoulders.

1805
01:57:20.08 --> 01:57:25.08
You can just leave it there and eventually start to hurt.

1806
01:57:25.08 --> 01:57:32.08
If you leave it there long enough, you'll just be on the ground with that weight on your chest.

1807
01:57:32.08 --> 01:57:37.08
You can't move anymore.

1808
01:57:37.08 --> 01:57:41.08
When you have that weight on the bar and it's on your shoulders, you shoulder press it.

1809
01:57:41.08 --> 01:57:43.08
Then you do it again.

1810
01:57:43.08 --> 01:57:46.08
Then you do it again and again.

1811
01:57:46.08 --> 01:57:48.08
Then you let your body adapt.

1812
01:57:48.08 --> 01:57:52.08
Next time you try and lift that weight, it's nothing.

1813
01:57:52.08 --> 01:57:53.08
You can do that weight easily.

1814
01:57:53.08 --> 01:57:54.08
I can handle that.

1815
01:57:54.08 --> 01:57:55.08
No problem.

1816
01:57:55.08 --> 01:57:58.08
Then you can handle even more weight.

1817
01:57:58.08 --> 01:58:04.08
Then when you get good at that, you seek out the weight.

1818
01:58:04.08 --> 01:58:08.08
You purposefully try and make things harder for yourself.

1819
01:58:08.08 --> 01:58:12.08
So that you can just become even stronger and even stronger.

1820
01:58:12.08 --> 01:58:16.08
And you embrace that and you start to enjoy it a little bit.

1821
01:58:16.08 --> 01:58:21.08
And so I think that's what I was trying to say there.

1822
01:58:21.08 --> 01:58:22.08
I think you said it.

1823
01:58:22.08 --> 01:58:27.08
Not only did you say it, but you actually are living that.

1824
01:58:27.08 --> 01:58:34.08
Currently at this time seeking out more.

1825
01:58:34.08 --> 01:58:40.08
I guess maybe I would even go so far to say stupid things to do.

1826
01:58:40.08 --> 01:58:46.08
So the next challenge that you put in front of yourself is the thing that you're about to do right now.

1827
01:58:46.08 --> 01:58:52.08
And I've never heard of a challenge like this before, but you're going to do a month of marathons.

1828
01:58:52.08 --> 01:58:55.08
Yeah.

1829
01:58:55.08 --> 01:58:59.08
So these things are only stupid or crazy if I fail.

1830
01:58:59.08 --> 01:59:02.08
If I tried not crazy because I did it.

1831
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:05.08
If I failed, then people could say it's crazy.

1832
01:59:05.08 --> 01:59:07.08
So I failed this one then it's stupid.

1833
01:59:07.08 --> 01:59:09.08
No man, I'll tell you what.

1834
01:59:09.08 --> 01:59:12.08
You going out there and making these things happen.

1835
01:59:12.08 --> 01:59:14.08
You know, it's awesome.

1836
01:59:14.08 --> 01:59:23.08
Whether you finish or not, no matter what you do, the fact that you're putting these hard core challenges in front of yourself is it's unbelievable.

1837
01:59:23.08 --> 01:59:33.08
So yeah, all this stuff that I've written down and what we've talked about, all the wisdom I've been able to gain through my injury and through being in the Marine Corps.

1838
01:59:33.08 --> 01:59:37.08
I think this, the month of marathons I'm about to do this.

1839
01:59:37.08 --> 01:59:42.08
And everything else that I that I try and do, I'm trying to be an example.

1840
01:59:42.08 --> 01:59:48.08
Because there's so many people that when I was trying to learn the right how to bike again,

1841
01:59:48.08 --> 01:59:54.08
I didn't know anybody that had ever done it before until I saw somebody that had done it.

1842
01:59:54.08 --> 02:00:01.08
And it just made everything once you realize it's possible, it makes it so much easier.

1843
02:00:01.08 --> 02:00:04.08
Because you know it can be done.

1844
02:00:04.08 --> 02:00:17.08
And so I want to be an example for people to look at and they see me and they say, well, they might not be trying to run 31 marathons and 31 days and 31 different cities.

1845
02:00:17.08 --> 02:00:20.08
Or rather bike across the country.

1846
02:00:20.08 --> 02:00:30.08
But they can say, there's a double above any amputee that ran 31 marathons in 31 days.

1847
02:00:30.08 --> 02:00:35.08
I can probably go walk on the treadmill.

1848
02:00:35.08 --> 02:00:42.08
So if I just want to be an example of that and I want to be an example of all of these lessons that I've learned,

1849
02:00:42.08 --> 02:00:47.08
a person that uses the weight instead of lets it destroy their life.

1850
02:00:47.08 --> 02:00:50.08
Somebody that stays in the fight keeps fighting no matter what.

1851
02:00:50.08 --> 02:00:52.08
That's what I'm trying to do.

1852
02:00:52.08 --> 02:00:57.08
I want to serve to show people what they can do.

1853
02:00:57.08 --> 02:01:03.08
And especially wounded veterans and people that might be struggling with what they saw.

1854
02:01:03.08 --> 02:01:09.08
And you know, I'm lucky enough that my mind is clear.

1855
02:01:09.08 --> 02:01:13.08
I had a great three concussion. That's it. No traumatic brain injury.

1856
02:01:13.08 --> 02:01:16.08
No push dramatic stress. Nothing like that.

1857
02:01:16.08 --> 02:01:27.08
And so I want to show civilians and veterans alike that it is possible to have a traumatic experience and come through and be fine.

1858
02:01:27.08 --> 02:01:36.08
And not have not have to suffer from post-traumatic stress that just overwhelms you.

1859
02:01:36.08 --> 02:01:44.08
Because I think in society these days it's almost becoming expected that you're going to go to war and you're going to come back.

1860
02:01:44.08 --> 02:01:48.08
And so a lot of people might end up being well.

1861
02:01:48.08 --> 02:01:50.08
I'm supposed to have post-traumatic stress.

1862
02:01:50.08 --> 02:01:58.08
So I'm going to just manifest it in myself where they let it get worse or they don't fight it.

1863
02:01:58.08 --> 02:02:00.08
They just let it happen.

1864
02:02:00.08 --> 02:02:15.08
And so I want to be an example of somebody that uses their experience and it just goes and has this terrible experience and you know, don't make a big deal about it.

1865
02:02:15.08 --> 02:02:21.08
And part of you doing that is running 31 freaking marifots in 31 days.

1866
02:02:21.08 --> 02:02:22.08
Yeah.

1867
02:02:22.08 --> 02:02:24.08
So when do you start?

1868
02:02:24.08 --> 02:02:27.08
So I'm going to start in 31 different cities.

1869
02:02:27.08 --> 02:02:31.08
In 31 different cities. My first city London.

1870
02:02:31.08 --> 02:02:34.08
London on October 12th.

1871
02:02:34.08 --> 02:02:36.08
And then I'm going to fly to Philadelphia.

1872
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:38.08
So basically the way it's going to work.

1873
02:02:38.08 --> 02:02:41.08
I'll run in a city.

1874
02:02:41.08 --> 02:02:43.08
Probably take about.

1875
02:02:43.08 --> 02:02:46.08
The whole thing I'll take breaks during the run.

1876
02:02:46.08 --> 02:02:52.08
So probably the whole thing will probably take five and a half, six hours to do.

1877
02:02:52.08 --> 02:02:59.08
I'll do the run on my own just like in a park or on a trail out and backs loops.

1878
02:02:59.08 --> 02:03:04.08
I'll do it on a 400 meter track if I have to.

1879
02:03:04.08 --> 02:03:06.08
Do that.

1880
02:03:06.08 --> 02:03:09.08
Getting my RV drive to the next place.

1881
02:03:09.08 --> 02:03:10.08
Spend the night there.

1882
02:03:10.08 --> 02:03:14.08
We upgraded from a box truck with the blocks in the back.

1883
02:03:14.08 --> 02:03:16.08
Well, the wife's going to be coming along.

1884
02:03:16.08 --> 02:03:18.08
So she won't be in a lot.

1885
02:03:18.08 --> 02:03:22.08
I have a crew for this one. I got my wife pan.

1886
02:03:22.08 --> 02:03:24.08
I'm going to be my team leader.

1887
02:03:24.08 --> 02:03:26.08
She's just doing so much stuff.

1888
02:03:26.08 --> 02:03:28.08
She's a team leader and everything.

1889
02:03:28.08 --> 02:03:30.08
Every job that you could possibly think of.

1890
02:03:30.08 --> 02:03:32.08
She's doing it.

1891
02:03:32.08 --> 02:03:34.08
And my mom is coming because she's massage therapist.

1892
02:03:34.08 --> 02:03:37.08
So she's going to give me massage and I'm going to have a driver.

1893
02:03:37.08 --> 02:03:38.08
Not my brother this time.

1894
02:03:38.08 --> 02:03:40.08
I think I blew him out.

1895
02:03:40.08 --> 02:03:43.08
I'm going to have a driver.

1896
02:03:43.08 --> 02:03:47.08
And so we're going to all hop in the RV drive to.

1897
02:03:47.08 --> 02:03:50.08
So from Philadelphia to New York.

1898
02:03:50.08 --> 02:03:52.08
Running New York.

1899
02:03:52.08 --> 02:03:55.08
Repeat until I go all the way around.

1900
02:03:55.08 --> 02:03:58.08
I'm going to end November 11th Veterans Day.

1901
02:03:58.08 --> 02:04:00.08
DC on the National Mall.

1902
02:04:00.08 --> 02:04:07.08
And and your goal obviously is to show people and lead people and set an amazing example.

1903
02:04:07.08 --> 02:04:15.08
And on top of that, you're going to earn money for some real specific charities that you

1904
02:04:15.08 --> 02:04:17.08
have been and stand behind.

1905
02:04:17.08 --> 02:04:19.08
And what are those charities?

1906
02:04:19.08 --> 02:04:20.08
Yeah.

1907
02:04:20.08 --> 02:04:21.08
So my goal.

1908
02:04:21.08 --> 02:04:23.08
My main goal is obviously the.

1909
02:04:23.08 --> 02:04:25.08
To be the example and all these kind of.

1910
02:04:25.08 --> 02:04:26.08
Grand.

1911
02:04:26.08 --> 02:04:28.08
Objectives.

1912
02:04:28.08 --> 02:04:30.08
But you know.

1913
02:04:30.08 --> 02:04:31.08
How do you really.

1914
02:04:31.08 --> 02:04:33.08
You can't quantify that really.

1915
02:04:33.08 --> 02:04:36.08
So the way that I'm quantifying it is I'm going to be raising money.

1916
02:04:36.08 --> 02:04:41.08
For three veterans charities that I've had personal contact with that have helped me.

1917
02:04:41.08 --> 02:04:49.08
My recovery and they are the Semper Fife fund, the Ton of the Towers Foundation and the Coalition

1918
02:04:49.08 --> 02:04:51.08
to Salud America's Heroes.

1919
02:04:51.08 --> 02:04:53.08
And so that's how I'm going to be.

1920
02:04:53.08 --> 02:04:58.08
That's also I'm going to be showing veterans that.

1921
02:04:58.08 --> 02:05:05.08
America loves them because that is something that's been made abundantly clear to me.

1922
02:05:05.08 --> 02:05:06.08
Everywhere I go.

1923
02:05:06.08 --> 02:05:07.08
All the time.

1924
02:05:07.08 --> 02:05:11.08
I think I did three breakfast in a row where somebody paid for it anonymously.

1925
02:05:11.08 --> 02:05:13.08
And I get thanked all the time.

1926
02:05:13.08 --> 02:05:18.08
And so if they're saying that stuff to me, it's obvious that they love all veterans.

1927
02:05:18.08 --> 02:05:22.08
And I'm trying to help connect that.

1928
02:05:22.08 --> 02:05:25.08
Just reduce that gap between.

1929
02:05:25.08 --> 02:05:32.08
The military and the civilian worlds and get them to to talk and and show that show veterans that.

1930
02:05:32.08 --> 02:05:35.08
They're coming back to a country that appreciates them.

1931
02:05:35.08 --> 02:05:40.08
And loves them more than pretty much any other thing.

1932
02:05:40.08 --> 02:05:48.08
And so I think by the donations and by having people come out and run with me and show me support.

1933
02:05:48.08 --> 02:05:52.08
Then that kind of helps us to prove that to people.

1934
02:05:52.08 --> 02:05:55.08
So where can we go donate?

1935
02:05:55.08 --> 02:05:57.08
What's the link?

1936
02:05:57.08 --> 02:05:59.08
Rob Jones journey.com.

1937
02:05:59.08 --> 02:06:01.08
Rob Jones journey.com.

1938
02:06:01.08 --> 02:06:03.08
There's a donate link there.

1939
02:06:03.08 --> 02:06:09.08
And you can also see my schedule there and I'll have details of where I'm going to be.

1940
02:06:09.08 --> 02:06:10.08
And it's the whole country.

1941
02:06:10.08 --> 02:06:11.08
It's East Coast West Coast.

1942
02:06:11.08 --> 02:06:12.08
Yeah.

1943
02:06:12.08 --> 02:06:13.08
Middle East Country.

1944
02:06:13.08 --> 02:06:14.08
The way around.

1945
02:06:14.08 --> 02:06:17.08
Far as you can drive in a day to get to an exporter on 26.2 miles.

1946
02:06:17.08 --> 02:06:19.08
Like my longest drive is 12, 14 hours.

1947
02:06:19.08 --> 02:06:20.08
And that happens.

1948
02:06:20.08 --> 02:06:21.08
Maybe once or twice.

1949
02:06:21.08 --> 02:06:24.08
So it's they're all pretty close to each other in major cities.

1950
02:06:24.08 --> 02:06:26.08
And yeah, you can go to my website.

1951
02:06:26.08 --> 02:06:28.08
For objones journey.com.

1952
02:06:28.08 --> 02:06:29.08
Donate there.

1953
02:06:29.08 --> 02:06:31.08
See my schedule.

1954
02:06:31.08 --> 02:06:33.08
RSVP that you're going to show up.

1955
02:06:33.08 --> 02:06:34.08
You don't have to.

1956
02:06:34.08 --> 02:06:36.08
But if you want to, that's cool.

1957
02:06:36.08 --> 02:06:38.08
I'll have all the details there.

1958
02:06:38.08 --> 02:06:40.08
And then social medias.

1959
02:06:40.08 --> 02:06:42.08
All at Rob Jones journey.

1960
02:06:42.08 --> 02:06:44.08
Awesome.

1961
02:06:44.08 --> 02:06:46.08
I.

1962
02:06:46.08 --> 02:06:48.08
It's awesome, man.

1963
02:06:48.08 --> 02:06:49.08
It's just awesome.

1964
02:06:49.08 --> 02:06:51.08
And you're freaking awesome.

1965
02:06:51.08 --> 02:06:52.08
And I grabbed a couple.

1966
02:06:52.08 --> 02:06:56.08
There's a little short piece from your journal.

1967
02:06:56.08 --> 02:06:59.08
Again, this is something that I just thought.

1968
02:06:59.08 --> 02:07:02.08
Is is just going to be helpful to me when I read it.

1969
02:07:02.08 --> 02:07:08.08
And we'll be helpful to anybody that that listens here or reads this.

1970
02:07:08.08 --> 02:07:12.08
And here we go back to your journal.

1971
02:07:12.08 --> 02:07:18.08
The conscious is in control of forming habits.

1972
02:07:18.08 --> 02:07:22.08
Every time we are faced with the decision of whether to quit, slow down,

1973
02:07:22.08 --> 02:07:25.08
and rationalize a reason why that's okay.

1974
02:07:25.08 --> 02:07:29.08
Or keep pressing forward.

1975
02:07:29.08 --> 02:07:33.08
One of those habits is strengthened.

1976
02:07:33.08 --> 02:07:43.08
The more times we choose to push on the stronger that habit will become.

1977
02:07:43.08 --> 02:07:48.08
It takes time and purposeful effort for these habits to become ingrained.

1978
02:07:48.08 --> 02:07:54.08
But once a person develops them in the gym doing something as simple as choosing to keep

1979
02:07:54.08 --> 02:08:03.08
rowing hard for another minute, they can apply what they have learned to the rest of their lives.

1980
02:08:03.08 --> 02:08:09.08
They will learn to take the harder path so that they are challenged more.

1981
02:08:09.08 --> 02:08:16.08
They will learn to put extra effort into daily tasks.

1982
02:08:16.08 --> 02:08:19.08
Who you are?

1983
02:08:19.08 --> 02:08:39.08
Depends entirely on your influences and the level of effort that is put into forging yourself into what you desire to be.

1984
02:08:39.08 --> 02:08:41.08
And that's awesome.

1985
02:08:41.08 --> 02:08:49.08
Every decision you make either gets you closer to your goal or move you further away.

1986
02:08:49.08 --> 02:08:54.08
And I am not saying I never make the decisions that move you to the left,

1987
02:08:54.08 --> 02:08:56.08
move you further away.

1988
02:08:56.08 --> 02:08:59.08
I am human just like everybody else.

1989
02:08:59.08 --> 02:09:02.08
Yeah, definitely.

1990
02:09:02.08 --> 02:09:05.08
You know, we were hanging out yesterday and I was busy.

1991
02:09:05.08 --> 02:09:09.08
So in that busyness, you know what I had for dinner last night?

1992
02:09:09.08 --> 02:09:11.08
No, I did not have memories.

1993
02:09:11.08 --> 02:09:12.08
That's not happening.

1994
02:09:12.08 --> 02:09:24.08
No, my entire dinner was a leftover piece of a Caesar salad and a giant mint chocolate chip milkshake.

1995
02:09:24.08 --> 02:09:30.08
Actually my wife was like, make me because I was working and you can't stop and eat when you are trying to work.

1996
02:09:30.08 --> 02:09:35.08
And so I just said, can you make me just a giant mint chocolate chip milkshake?

1997
02:09:35.08 --> 02:09:40.08
Now I didn't get closer to my, you know, physical goals.

1998
02:09:40.08 --> 02:09:41.08
But I got a lot of work done.

1999
02:09:41.08 --> 02:09:46.08
I got an extra whatever 28 minutes worth of work done because I didn't stop to eat dinner.

2000
02:09:46.08 --> 02:09:48.08
Yeah, you got to take the wins with the losses.

2001
02:09:48.08 --> 02:09:49.08
I dig it.

2002
02:09:49.08 --> 02:09:56.08
And it's all just about, you know, making that, it's like, you plot your progress on a graph.

2003
02:09:56.08 --> 02:10:02.08
And you're going to have, it's long, it's going to go up and it's going to go down a little bit.

2004
02:10:02.08 --> 02:10:09.08
Then it's going to go up and it's going to go down. So as long as that trend is upward, then you know, you really have nothing to worry about.

2005
02:10:09.08 --> 02:10:16.08
But if that things are to level off and then to go the other way, then you need to ask for salesman questions and you give yourself some honest answers.

2006
02:10:16.08 --> 02:10:19.08
Yeah, you know, we had a conversation not too long ago.

2007
02:10:19.08 --> 02:10:29.08
A guy asked about Jiu Jitsu belts and said, you know, I understand that you shouldn't pursue because in Jiu Jitsu, it's like, hey, you shouldn't just like go to get a belt.

2008
02:10:29.08 --> 02:10:36.08
You go because you want to get better and you want to learn and and he said, you know, I understand that you shouldn't just do it to get the belts.

2009
02:10:36.08 --> 02:10:41.08
But it's good to mark your progress and figure your progress out.

2010
02:10:41.08 --> 02:10:48.08
And I was, and that's true. And that's what you're saying. Like, yeah, and I've talked about that too.

2011
02:10:48.08 --> 02:10:56.08
You know, I related to shooting where when you, when you focus on the target, your vision gets blurry.

2012
02:10:56.08 --> 02:11:01.08
And so you lose track of the long term, the long term goal or the long range target.

2013
02:11:01.08 --> 02:11:07.08
So that's why we focus on our front site because we can keep that little thing that's right in front of us on our rifle.

2014
02:11:07.08 --> 02:11:14.08
You can keep that in focus. So that's what you focus on. And every once in a while, if you start that maybe that gets a little blurry.

2015
02:11:14.08 --> 02:11:17.08
Well, then you look at your long term targeting because that daily grind will beat you down too.

2016
02:11:17.08 --> 02:11:22.08
Yeah. And if you just lift the daily grind, the daily grind, the daily grind beating you down.

2017
02:11:22.08 --> 02:11:29.08
And then you, you forget what your goal was in the first place. But so everyone's well. Yeah, you got to look up your long term goal and say,

2018
02:11:29.08 --> 02:11:34.08
I want to be doing this or achieve that or whatever. I want to do 31 marathon.

2019
02:11:34.08 --> 02:11:40.08
See, some people would have picked like February, right? Well, there's 28 marathon.

2020
02:11:40.08 --> 02:11:44.08
So you're going to the full 31.

2021
02:11:44.08 --> 02:11:46.08
That's the difference right there.

2022
02:11:46.08 --> 02:11:54.08
Hey, yeah, if I want to make it, if I want to make these points, that's why I rode my bike from Maine to Southern California.

2023
02:11:54.08 --> 02:12:03.08
I was sitting there going, yeah, I could, I could ride Florida to San Diego. It would be technically be all the way across.

2024
02:12:03.08 --> 02:12:10.08
Yeah, but technically. But there would be that, but I don't want any butts associated with anything that I do.

2025
02:12:10.08 --> 02:12:17.08
I don't want anybody to have any reason to say, oh, yeah, Rob Jones, see, ran 31 marathon 31 days.

2026
02:12:17.08 --> 02:12:19.08
I've got to done 32.

2027
02:12:19.08 --> 02:12:25.08
Did you got to do a good job on on your social media when you're going to go out on this thing? You got to document this thing and post it.

2028
02:12:25.08 --> 02:12:33.08
So I'm hoping, I'm hoping. So I'm working with Sports Illustrated. I think they're going to do a video.

2029
02:12:33.08 --> 02:12:35.08
Nice. I heard of them.

2030
02:12:35.08 --> 02:12:36.08
Yeah. Good.

2031
02:12:36.08 --> 02:12:41.08
Do they do good videos? Probably.

2032
02:12:41.08 --> 02:12:45.08
That's that discriminating judge of videos right there.

2033
02:12:45.08 --> 02:12:51.08
So yeah, I plan. Like, you know, I documented the bike ride. That's that documentary is on my website too.

2034
02:12:51.08 --> 02:13:02.08
Yeah. So yeah, I do try and document these things and just in case people don't happen to catch it while I'm doing it, they can go back and use that as their example for what I've done.

2035
02:13:02.08 --> 02:13:11.08
They can find out that way. Yeah. Well, I know you get stuff done and you hammer out your daily tasks.

2036
02:13:11.08 --> 02:13:15.08
We're going to let Echo hammer out his daily task right now.

2037
02:13:15.08 --> 02:13:17.08
Technically we've reached out.

2038
02:13:17.08 --> 02:13:18.08
We've reached out.

2039
02:13:18.08 --> 02:13:19.08
We've reached out.

2040
02:13:19.08 --> 02:13:23.08
I do. I'd extra respect on the weight lifting analogy.

2041
02:13:23.08 --> 02:13:26.08
I think like weight lifting and exercising in general, like,

2042
02:13:26.08 --> 02:13:31.08
the perfect analogy for most things. You know, because it's like, yeah, I mean, I could go into it.

2043
02:13:31.08 --> 02:13:32.08
But yeah.

2044
02:13:32.08 --> 02:13:36.08
That is an app that I'll stand in analogy.

2045
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:37.08
Yeah.

2046
02:13:37.08 --> 02:13:39.08
Like, hey, that weights on you.

2047
02:13:39.08 --> 02:13:39.08
Yeah.

2048
02:13:39.08 --> 02:13:42.08
You're either going to use it to get better or you're going to let it bear you in the ground.

2049
02:13:42.08 --> 02:13:43.08
Yeah.

2050
02:13:43.08 --> 02:13:44.08
The choice is yours.

2051
02:13:44.08 --> 02:13:45.08
What are you going to do?

2052
02:13:45.08 --> 02:13:45.08
Yeah.

2053
02:13:45.08 --> 02:13:52.08
And like, and it goes to show we talk about this sometimes where you can take a let's say a random person, right?

2054
02:13:52.08 --> 02:13:58.08
And be like, hey, let's go to the gym and there can be literally opposite reactions if you get to different people.

2055
02:13:58.08 --> 02:14:03.08
So one guy can be like, yeah, let's go to the gym and work out and he's trying to get in shape. Good.

2056
02:14:03.08 --> 02:14:05.08
You know, it's this thing.

2057
02:14:05.08 --> 02:14:07.08
Or you can get someone to be like, that's the worst thing in the world.

2058
02:14:07.08 --> 02:14:09.08
I don't want to go to the gym.

2059
02:14:09.08 --> 02:14:09.08
I don't.

2060
02:14:09.08 --> 02:14:10.08
Yeah.

2061
02:14:10.08 --> 02:14:11.08
That's hard.

2062
02:14:11.08 --> 02:14:13.08
And it hurts even the next day it hurts.

2063
02:14:13.08 --> 02:14:16.08
You know, so me and while it's the same exact activity, by the way.

2064
02:14:16.08 --> 02:14:17.08
Yeah.

2065
02:14:17.08 --> 02:14:19.08
So you can look at in those two different ways.

2066
02:14:19.08 --> 02:14:27.08
You know what else is messed up is there's activities that are also good for you.

2067
02:14:27.08 --> 02:14:36.08
And move you in a direction that you want to be moving, but maybe like, let's say the got you can let we can give you a really good example.

2068
02:14:36.08 --> 02:14:38.08
You take a meat head, right?

2069
02:14:38.08 --> 02:14:40.08
And you go, okay.

2070
02:14:40.08 --> 02:14:42.08
You want to go to the gym?

2071
02:14:42.08 --> 02:14:43.08
What does the meat head say?

2072
02:14:43.08 --> 02:14:44.08
Hills.

2073
02:14:44.08 --> 02:14:45.08
Yes.

2074
02:14:45.08 --> 02:14:46.08
Let's go get it.

2075
02:14:46.08 --> 02:14:50.08
But then you say to that same guy who seems all motivated and fired up to improve himself.

2076
02:14:50.08 --> 02:14:51.08
Yeah.

2077
02:14:51.08 --> 02:15:01.08
And you say, hey, let's go read a book and try and, you know, understand better this concept of whatever.

2078
02:15:01.08 --> 02:15:02.08
Yeah.

2079
02:15:02.08 --> 02:15:03.08
And what do they say then?

2080
02:15:03.08 --> 02:15:04.08
Yeah.

2081
02:15:04.08 --> 02:15:05.08
I'm going to the gym.

2082
02:15:05.08 --> 02:15:06.08
Yeah.

2083
02:15:06.08 --> 02:15:07.08
So it's interesting.

2084
02:15:07.08 --> 02:15:07.08
Yeah.

2085
02:15:07.08 --> 02:15:12.08
The weight is necessarily just a physical weight.

2086
02:15:12.08 --> 02:15:13.08
Right.

2087
02:15:13.08 --> 02:15:16.08
And you're going to up against whatever it is that's going to improve you.

2088
02:15:16.08 --> 02:15:17.08
Yeah.

2089
02:15:17.08 --> 02:15:21.08
You can either use it to beat you down or you can use it to make yourself better.

2090
02:15:21.08 --> 02:15:22.08
Yeah.

2091
02:15:22.08 --> 02:15:25.08
And again, just as a concept, right?

2092
02:15:25.08 --> 02:15:29.08
I think the exercise and weight lifting and your body just kind of,

2093
02:15:29.08 --> 02:15:33.08
figuratively condemnestrate just so much, you know, better place so much.

2094
02:15:33.08 --> 02:15:35.08
And you especially feel that way about curls.

2095
02:15:35.08 --> 02:15:36.08
Is that what I'm hearing?

2096
02:15:36.08 --> 02:15:37.08
Yeah.

2097
02:15:37.08 --> 02:15:39.08
It depends on the thing like, yeah.

2098
02:15:39.08 --> 02:15:40.08
Generally.

2099
02:15:40.08 --> 02:15:42.08
Anyway.

2100
02:15:42.08 --> 02:15:45.08
Speaking of curls.

2101
02:15:45.08 --> 02:15:48.08
Wait, should I go into this now?

2102
02:15:48.08 --> 02:15:50.08
Your daily tasks?

2103
02:15:50.08 --> 02:15:50.08
Yeah.

2104
02:15:50.08 --> 02:15:51.08
Your weekly tasks?

2105
02:15:51.08 --> 02:15:52.08
I think you should.

2106
02:15:52.08 --> 02:15:52.08
Yeah.

2107
02:15:52.08 --> 02:15:52.08
Yeah.

2108
02:15:52.08 --> 02:15:53.08
My little bit.

2109
02:15:53.08 --> 02:15:55.08
Well, I got a Rob Jones here to listen.

2110
02:15:55.08 --> 02:15:56.08
Yeah.

2111
02:15:56.08 --> 02:15:57.08
So what up?

2112
02:15:57.08 --> 02:15:58.08
I can't wait to hear this.

2113
02:15:58.08 --> 02:15:59.08
The support.

2114
02:15:59.08 --> 02:16:00.08
Yeah.

2115
02:16:00.08 --> 02:16:01.08
Live.

2116
02:16:01.08 --> 02:16:03.08
You get to witness the support you live.

2117
02:16:03.08 --> 02:16:04.08
The honor.

2118
02:16:04.08 --> 02:16:06.08
So watch, watch echo do his work.

2119
02:16:06.08 --> 02:16:07.08
His life's work.

2120
02:16:07.08 --> 02:16:08.08
Right here.

2121
02:16:08.08 --> 02:16:09.08
Support you.

2122
02:16:09.08 --> 02:16:12.08
I don't know how to see if you want to be edited video.

2123
02:16:12.08 --> 02:16:13.08
So, so dope.

2124
02:16:13.08 --> 02:16:14.08
You know.

2125
02:16:14.08 --> 02:16:15.08
Anyway.

2126
02:16:15.08 --> 02:16:19.08
Made in America.

2127
02:16:19.08 --> 02:16:20.08
Origin.

2128
02:16:20.08 --> 02:16:22.08
That's the company.

2129
02:16:22.08 --> 02:16:23.08
OriginMain.com.

2130
02:16:23.08 --> 02:16:24.08
You started in Maine.

2131
02:16:24.08 --> 02:16:25.08
Yeah.

2132
02:16:25.08 --> 02:16:26.08
By credit, trust me.

2133
02:16:26.08 --> 02:16:26.08
Yeah.

2134
02:16:26.08 --> 02:16:27.08
That's where this place is.

2135
02:16:27.08 --> 02:16:29.08
We just got back what last week.

2136
02:16:29.08 --> 02:16:29.08
Yeah.

2137
02:16:29.08 --> 02:16:30.08
Yeah.

2138
02:16:30.08 --> 02:16:31.08
We can have whatever.

2139
02:16:31.08 --> 02:16:32.08
Yeah.

2140
02:16:32.08 --> 02:16:33.08
That's a cool spot.

2141
02:16:33.08 --> 02:16:34.08
You know, he has a.

2142
02:16:34.08 --> 02:16:35.08
Side note.

2143
02:16:35.08 --> 02:16:36.08
He has like this.

2144
02:16:36.08 --> 02:16:38.08
I think it's on like the history channel or something like that.

2145
02:16:38.08 --> 02:16:39.08
Where it was kind of like a show.

2146
02:16:39.08 --> 02:16:42.08
And you know, the story you told about getting he got this.

2147
02:16:42.08 --> 02:16:43.08
The loom right where he got it.

2148
02:16:43.08 --> 02:16:44.08
Did not actually make.

2149
02:16:44.08 --> 02:16:45.08
Right.

2150
02:16:45.08 --> 02:16:46.08
They like came and filmed some stuff.

2151
02:16:46.08 --> 02:16:47.08
Yeah.

2152
02:16:47.08 --> 02:16:48.08
Produced.

2153
02:16:48.08 --> 02:16:48.08
Yeah.

2154
02:16:48.08 --> 02:16:49.08
He showed it to me.

2155
02:16:49.08 --> 02:16:50.08
But it was great.

2156
02:16:50.08 --> 02:16:51.08
Because when he's telling the story, I'm like, man,

2157
02:16:51.08 --> 02:16:55.08
that took you took like to eight hours or something or more than that.

2158
02:16:55.08 --> 02:16:56.08
Yeah.

2159
02:16:56.08 --> 02:16:57.08
Yeah.

2160
02:16:57.08 --> 02:16:58.08
Like to get it.

2161
02:16:58.08 --> 02:16:59.08
And it's this big thing.

2162
02:16:59.08 --> 02:16:59.08
And it kind of showed it.

2163
02:16:59.08 --> 02:17:00.08
They were there for that.

2164
02:17:00.08 --> 02:17:01.08
Yeah.

2165
02:17:01.08 --> 02:17:02.08
Moving the looms.

2166
02:17:02.08 --> 02:17:03.08
Yeah.

2167
02:17:03.08 --> 02:17:04.08
You know what the loom is?

2168
02:17:04.08 --> 02:17:05.08
No.

2169
02:17:05.08 --> 02:17:06.08
Okay.

2170
02:17:06.08 --> 02:17:07.08
And me neither.

2171
02:17:07.08 --> 02:17:08.08
You know what?

2172
02:17:08.08 --> 02:17:09.08
Loom is.

2173
02:17:09.08 --> 02:17:10.08
I was like, loom.

2174
02:17:10.08 --> 02:17:12.08
I've heard that like one of the fruits of the loom.

2175
02:17:12.08 --> 02:17:13.08
Right.

2176
02:17:13.08 --> 02:17:14.08
Yeah.

2177
02:17:14.08 --> 02:17:17.08
And when you think about it, it makes sense because fruit of the loom is like

2178
02:17:17.08 --> 02:17:18.08
Right.

2179
02:17:18.08 --> 02:17:19.08
It's the fabric.

2180
02:17:19.08 --> 02:17:20.08
You know, it has all the strings.

2181
02:17:20.08 --> 02:17:21.08
Yeah.

2182
02:17:21.08 --> 02:17:22.08
Yeah.

2183
02:17:22.08 --> 02:17:23.08
Makes fabric.

2184
02:17:23.08 --> 02:17:24.08
Anyway.

2185
02:17:24.08 --> 02:17:27.08
So when they say made in America, in this case, it's for real made in America.

2186
02:17:27.08 --> 02:17:28.08
They get to cotton from America.

2187
02:17:28.08 --> 02:17:30.08
They make it with a loom.

2188
02:17:30.08 --> 02:17:31.08
Yeah.

2189
02:17:31.08 --> 02:17:35.08
With looms that this guy Pete Roberts up at origin, which we're in league now with

2190
02:17:35.08 --> 02:17:36.08
origin.

2191
02:17:36.08 --> 02:17:37.08
Yeah.

2192
02:17:37.08 --> 02:17:42.08
But we went up into old mills because all the mills up there a lot of them shut down.

2193
02:17:42.08 --> 02:17:43.08
Yeah.

2194
02:17:43.08 --> 02:17:44.88
And actually, I think all of them shut down.

2195
02:17:44.88 --> 02:17:51.40
And these were these were factories that were like half a million square feet.

2196
02:17:51.40 --> 02:17:56.88
And they were filled with looms and filled with production and filled with American workers.

2197
02:17:56.88 --> 02:17:59.16
And it all went overseas.

2198
02:17:59.16 --> 02:18:07.46
And he went in and literally bought a loom for like, I think that I think was like

2199
02:18:07.46 --> 02:18:08.46
3000.

2200
02:18:08.46 --> 02:18:11.06
The cost of the scrap metal that it was worth.

2201
02:18:11.06 --> 02:18:15.34
Anyways, took it, hired some old timers that knew, still knew how to work, it brought

2202
02:18:15.34 --> 02:18:19.10
them back to work and then started making clothes.

2203
02:18:19.10 --> 02:18:21.74
And well, making jizzy pieces of what he started with.

2204
02:18:21.74 --> 02:18:24.84
But we're, you know, got everything being lined up to get made.

2205
02:18:24.84 --> 02:18:28.84
And that loom, they only had that one because they were going to put in a museum.

2206
02:18:28.84 --> 02:18:33.04
Yeah, they were literally going to take that one loom that they had left and they were

2207
02:18:33.04 --> 02:18:34.04
going to put making a museum.

2208
02:18:34.04 --> 02:18:35.04
Yes, it's still over.

2209
02:18:35.04 --> 02:18:36.04
Right.

2210
02:18:36.04 --> 02:18:40.80
You know, that's, that's so awesome because there's so many people out there now that are like,

2211
02:18:40.80 --> 02:18:43.76
oh, our country has to make problems or country has to make problems.

2212
02:18:43.76 --> 02:18:44.76
We need to do this.

2213
02:18:44.76 --> 02:18:46.40
We need to do that.

2214
02:18:46.40 --> 02:18:49.36
And they say somebody used to do this.

2215
02:18:49.36 --> 02:18:50.36
Somebody needs to.

2216
02:18:50.36 --> 02:18:51.36
Yeah.

2217
02:18:51.36 --> 02:18:53.64
And it's like, hey, you don't want you.

2218
02:18:53.64 --> 02:18:54.64
And here's the guy that's doing that.

2219
02:18:54.64 --> 02:18:55.64
Yeah, that's people.

2220
02:18:55.64 --> 02:18:56.64
So that's what boom.

2221
02:18:56.64 --> 02:18:57.64
Yeah.

2222
02:18:57.64 --> 02:18:58.64
Yeah.

2223
02:18:58.64 --> 02:19:01.92
He's interesting to when we went, they can tell he's into it.

2224
02:19:01.92 --> 02:19:03.56
He's like he, we're driving up there.

2225
02:19:03.56 --> 02:19:05.56
He's talking about how yarn is all made and stuff.

2226
02:19:05.56 --> 02:19:07.40
And he's like, hey, I got to come down.

2227
02:19:07.40 --> 02:19:08.40
Yeah.

2228
02:19:08.40 --> 02:19:09.40
I'm getting to it.

2229
02:19:09.40 --> 02:19:12.40
But you know, you don't even need to say he's into it.

2230
02:19:12.40 --> 02:19:16.96
Because he went out and bought a broken rusty loom and we furnished it and moved it

2231
02:19:16.96 --> 02:19:18.96
into a factory that he built on his own property.

2232
02:19:18.96 --> 02:19:19.96
It's ridiculous.

2233
02:19:19.96 --> 02:19:20.96
Yeah.

2234
02:19:20.96 --> 02:19:21.96
And it shows, too.

2235
02:19:21.96 --> 02:19:25.40
Like the geese, like you might do geodes here today.

2236
02:19:25.40 --> 02:19:26.40
Yeah.

2237
02:19:26.40 --> 02:19:29.36
They're like, they're cool. You know, martial arts geese or whatever, but he brings

2238
02:19:29.36 --> 02:19:31.64
like this added like element to it.

2239
02:19:31.64 --> 02:19:34.64
Well, because he specifically designs him for, yeah, for you.

2240
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:35.64
Yeah.

2241
02:19:35.64 --> 02:19:39.80
It's not the kind of words like, hey, let me get a ge, blank from overseas or whatever.

2242
02:19:39.80 --> 02:19:40.80
Yeah.

2243
02:19:40.80 --> 02:19:41.68
And like, embroidered or my logo on it.

2244
02:19:41.68 --> 02:19:43.08
So it's kind of like the same thing.

2245
02:19:43.08 --> 02:19:46.92
You don't, you don't have much innovation freedom with a physical product.

2246
02:19:46.92 --> 02:19:47.92
He does.

2247
02:19:47.92 --> 02:19:50.96
So it's like, I took out his wrong knee other day.

2248
02:19:50.96 --> 02:19:51.96
Ge.

2249
02:19:51.96 --> 02:19:52.96
Whatever.

2250
02:19:52.96 --> 02:19:55.68
I take off the top and you'd left with just the pants.

2251
02:19:55.68 --> 02:19:59.92
So the pants are like thereby like sizes, you know, you were 36.

2252
02:19:59.92 --> 02:20:02.64
In regular stuff, it's just the like numbers.

2253
02:20:02.64 --> 02:20:05.04
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6.

2254
02:20:05.04 --> 02:20:06.72
This is like fitted to you, right?

2255
02:20:06.72 --> 02:20:07.56
So I'm wearing the pants.

2256
02:20:07.56 --> 02:20:09.40
And they feel like kind of like normal pants.

2257
02:20:09.40 --> 02:20:10.40
Yeah.

2258
02:20:10.40 --> 02:20:11.84
And I was Greg in one.

2259
02:20:11.84 --> 02:20:13.80
They were like, they were noticing.

2260
02:20:13.80 --> 02:20:15.04
Yeah.

2261
02:20:15.04 --> 02:20:18.24
You almost don't mind getting choked out by a guitar.

2262
02:20:18.24 --> 02:20:19.24
He's all skis.

2263
02:20:19.24 --> 02:20:20.24
He's all skis.

2264
02:20:20.24 --> 02:20:21.24
So sweet.

2265
02:20:21.24 --> 02:20:22.24
There's a thing.

2266
02:20:22.24 --> 02:20:23.24
My streak every day.

2267
02:20:23.24 --> 02:20:24.24
And I wear it every day.

2268
02:20:24.24 --> 02:20:25.24
I have two tops.

2269
02:20:25.24 --> 02:20:26.76
Every day in the streak is still alive.

2270
02:20:26.76 --> 02:20:30.16
Every single time someone asks, like, what up with that key?

2271
02:20:30.16 --> 02:20:31.60
Oh, let me see that.

2272
02:20:31.60 --> 02:20:32.60
There you go.

2273
02:20:32.60 --> 02:20:34.56
There are way that fabric is woven as legit.

2274
02:20:34.56 --> 02:20:35.40
Yeah.

2275
02:20:35.40 --> 02:20:36.16
This legit.

2276
02:20:36.16 --> 02:20:36.52
Yeah.

2277
02:20:36.52 --> 02:20:38.40
And see these shorts I have on right now?

2278
02:20:38.40 --> 02:20:38.68
I should.

2279
02:20:38.68 --> 02:20:41.24
I kind of in a way shouldn't mention these because be

2280
02:20:41.24 --> 02:20:43.04
second out we're not making those shorts because they don't make

2281
02:20:43.04 --> 02:20:43.48
these shorts.

2282
02:20:43.48 --> 02:20:44.08
We will make.

2283
02:20:44.08 --> 02:20:44.60
Okay.

2284
02:20:44.60 --> 02:20:46.20
I've worn these three days and wrote by the way.

2285
02:20:46.20 --> 02:20:46.80
Oh, nice.

2286
02:20:46.80 --> 02:20:47.80
That's what that smell was.

2287
02:20:47.80 --> 02:20:49.52
What did I wear?

2288
02:20:49.52 --> 02:20:51.48
I washed the ones.

2289
02:20:51.48 --> 02:20:52.80
But yeah, they're my favorite shorts.

2290
02:20:52.80 --> 02:20:54.76
They're made out of the same material as one of the

2291
02:20:54.76 --> 02:20:55.76
these.

2292
02:20:55.76 --> 02:20:56.76
Yeah, it looks nice.

2293
02:20:56.76 --> 02:20:57.76
Yeah.

2294
02:20:57.76 --> 02:20:58.76
I spilled some eggs on it.

2295
02:20:58.76 --> 02:20:59.76
And you know, it leaves them.

2296
02:20:59.76 --> 02:21:01.32
These shorts are black by the way.

2297
02:21:01.32 --> 02:21:03.52
So you know how you when you spill eggs or out of nozzles, feed

2298
02:21:03.52 --> 02:21:04.80
my son yogurt and stuff.

2299
02:21:04.80 --> 02:21:06.92
And it's spilt on it.

2300
02:21:06.92 --> 02:21:08.12
So you just take a brush.

2301
02:21:08.12 --> 02:21:10.64
Like, you know, like a brush you find under your sink or whatever, put

2302
02:21:10.64 --> 02:21:11.64
some water in.

2303
02:21:11.64 --> 02:21:12.64
I scrubbed it.

2304
02:21:12.64 --> 02:21:13.80
You can't do that on like your shorts.

2305
02:21:13.80 --> 02:21:15.92
It'll start to wear it out, you know?

2306
02:21:15.92 --> 02:21:16.92
But it gives tough.

2307
02:21:16.92 --> 02:21:17.92
It's supposed to be tough.

2308
02:21:17.92 --> 02:21:18.92
Yeah.

2309
02:21:18.92 --> 02:21:19.92
We won't did it.

2310
02:21:19.92 --> 02:21:20.92
You don't have to wash it.

2311
02:21:20.92 --> 02:21:21.92
You know what I'm sorry.

2312
02:21:21.92 --> 02:21:22.92
You can't get the shorts.

2313
02:21:22.92 --> 02:21:23.92
I don't get you.

2314
02:21:23.92 --> 02:21:24.92
You can't get it.

2315
02:21:24.92 --> 02:21:25.92
We'll make them.

2316
02:21:25.92 --> 02:21:26.92
Yeah.

2317
02:21:26.92 --> 02:21:27.92
So stand by for that.

2318
02:21:27.92 --> 02:21:35.000
Nonetheless, do you do the keys, all kinds of rash guards, and even like regular clothes, shirts,

2319
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.76
hoodies and whatnot, the joggers, like you putting on the joggers and walking around

2320
02:21:38.76 --> 02:21:39.76
in front of my wife.

2321
02:21:39.76 --> 02:21:40.76
She likes it.

2322
02:21:40.76 --> 02:21:41.76
That was a weird thing.

2323
02:21:41.76 --> 02:21:42.76
Cause I didn't actually know what.

2324
02:21:42.76 --> 02:21:43.76
Do you know what joggers are?

2325
02:21:43.76 --> 02:21:44.76
Or are new joggers?

2326
02:21:44.76 --> 02:21:47.92
You know, they're like, they're like, they're like, that's what the passion

2327
02:21:47.92 --> 02:21:48.92
thing though.

2328
02:21:48.92 --> 02:21:52.12
They're like sweatpants, but they're somehow more high end.

2329
02:21:52.12 --> 02:21:53.12
Yeah.

2330
02:21:53.12 --> 02:21:57.36
They're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like skinny jeans.

2331
02:21:57.36 --> 02:21:58.36
They're like skinny jeans.

2332
02:21:58.36 --> 02:21:59.36
What's that pants?

2333
02:21:59.36 --> 02:22:00.36
Yeah.

2334
02:22:00.36 --> 02:22:02.96
I'm gonna go ahead and say, I don't endorse that.

2335
02:22:02.96 --> 02:22:03.96
I didn't.

2336
02:22:03.96 --> 02:22:04.96
Neither did I.

2337
02:22:04.96 --> 02:22:06.56
Neither did I, but I put them on.

2338
02:22:06.56 --> 02:22:09.92
And I was like, I was like, these, I don't know how I look cause they didn't have

2339
02:22:09.92 --> 02:22:12.04
a mirror in the cabin.

2340
02:22:12.04 --> 02:22:16.32
Except in the bathroom, but nonetheless.

2341
02:22:16.32 --> 02:22:17.56
So I couldn't see how they look.

2342
02:22:17.56 --> 02:22:19.96
They look kind of strange from up here, but I don't know.

2343
02:22:19.96 --> 02:22:21.20
So I was like, grab one of them.

2344
02:22:21.20 --> 02:22:22.20
They're gorgeous.

2345
02:22:22.20 --> 02:22:26.000
And he wore the origin jogger pants and the matching origin.

2346
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.08
He sweatshirt or hoodie.

2347
02:22:28.08 --> 02:22:31.60
And he rolled out like that like it was like it was the deal.

2348
02:22:31.60 --> 02:22:34.40
And then he looked, he was straight up leisure suit.

2349
02:22:34.40 --> 02:22:35.40
Is what he was rolling.

2350
02:22:35.40 --> 02:22:37.56
He was not playing around.

2351
02:22:37.56 --> 02:22:41.72
And then when I came in, I thought people would be like, oh, you know, you

2352
02:22:41.72 --> 02:22:43.96
don't match in that cause I'm not used to wearing.

2353
02:22:43.96 --> 02:22:46.72
But Pete said that I looked good in it.

2354
02:22:46.72 --> 02:22:48.32
And then my wife said I looked good in it.

2355
02:22:48.32 --> 02:22:49.52
Oh, that one I think credit for.

2356
02:22:49.52 --> 02:22:50.52
But what I did for.

2357
02:22:50.52 --> 02:22:52.04
So you grab Pete made it.

2358
02:22:52.04 --> 02:22:52.72
Of course, yeah.

2359
02:22:52.72 --> 02:22:53.56
Oh, yeah.

2360
02:22:53.56 --> 02:22:54.56
I don't know.

2361
02:22:54.56 --> 02:22:57.88
But it was a moment of honesty because he mentioned either you.

2362
02:22:57.88 --> 02:23:01.40
I don't, I think it was you or someone he was like, I don't think just

2363
02:23:01.40 --> 02:23:02.40
Jockel could pull it off.

2364
02:23:02.40 --> 02:23:03.40
Yes.

2365
02:23:03.40 --> 02:23:04.40
He's right.

2366
02:23:04.40 --> 02:23:05.40
No, might have been someone else.

2367
02:23:05.40 --> 02:23:06.40
I don't think it's talking about you.

2368
02:23:06.40 --> 02:23:07.40
He's right.

2369
02:23:07.40 --> 02:23:08.40
Either way.

2370
02:23:08.40 --> 02:23:09.84
John, there's a one to pull off.

2371
02:23:09.84 --> 02:23:10.84
But whatever.

2372
02:23:10.84 --> 02:23:11.84
Close design for robots.

2373
02:23:11.84 --> 02:23:12.84
No.

2374
02:23:12.84 --> 02:23:13.84
No, not happening.

2375
02:23:13.84 --> 02:23:18.44
No, I'm maybe I'm not securing my manhead.

2376
02:23:18.44 --> 02:23:19.44
No, I just got for it.

2377
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:20.44
That girl's close.

2378
02:23:20.44 --> 02:23:23.12
I'm not really not.

2379
02:23:23.12 --> 02:23:26.68
Nonetheless, functionally that is what I noticed right when I put them on though.

2380
02:23:26.68 --> 02:23:30.12
Like when you roll out, you know how like if you have and not that it's even a big deal.

2381
02:23:30.12 --> 02:23:31.12
Even me talking about it.

2382
02:23:31.12 --> 02:23:32.12
Because you have a lot of things.

2383
02:23:32.12 --> 02:23:36.08
Ecosys, things like you know how it is when something happens.

2384
02:23:36.08 --> 02:23:39.96
But actually, I have no idea what you were in skinny jeans.

2385
02:23:39.96 --> 02:23:42.76
Like I actually have a lot of that no idea what you're talking about.

2386
02:23:42.76 --> 02:23:47.16
But I roll with it because we're trying to condense the timeline of the support speed

2387
02:23:47.16 --> 02:23:48.92
speaking, which is hard.

2388
02:23:48.92 --> 02:23:53.60
In the spirit of accuracy, I'm going to go down this whole, you know when you wear heavy

2389
02:23:53.60 --> 02:23:55.52
everyone sweatpants every in your life.

2390
02:23:55.52 --> 02:23:56.52
Not really.

2391
02:23:56.52 --> 02:23:57.52
Really kind of sweatpants.

2392
02:23:57.52 --> 02:23:58.52
Okay Rob Jones.

2393
02:23:58.52 --> 02:23:59.52
I have orange, pre-endria.

2394
02:23:59.52 --> 02:24:00.52
Yeah.

2395
02:24:00.52 --> 02:24:03.28
So consider this when you let's say like, I don't know you're running or walking

2396
02:24:03.28 --> 02:24:04.28
or whatever.

2397
02:24:04.28 --> 02:24:06.04
Like the sweatpants are you lose they flow.

2398
02:24:06.04 --> 02:24:07.20
It's not a big deal.

2399
02:24:07.20 --> 02:24:08.20
I dig it.

2400
02:24:08.20 --> 02:24:09.52
I understand.

2401
02:24:09.52 --> 02:24:12.68
But skinny jeans sweatpants.

2402
02:24:12.68 --> 02:24:13.68
Jawers.

2403
02:24:13.68 --> 02:24:14.68
I wish I could say skinny jeans.

2404
02:24:14.68 --> 02:24:16.68
You need to get this off my podcast.

2405
02:24:16.68 --> 02:24:17.68
Now.

2406
02:24:17.68 --> 02:24:18.68
You're a jet.

2407
02:24:18.68 --> 02:24:21.20
They function because they don't flap around.

2408
02:24:21.20 --> 02:24:24.48
They're like, if you're running with them, they work.

2409
02:24:24.48 --> 02:24:26.32
I'm just running shorts.

2410
02:24:26.32 --> 02:24:27.32
Right.

2411
02:24:27.32 --> 02:24:28.32
For that very risk.

2412
02:24:28.32 --> 02:24:29.32
I don't care if it's three feet as snow.

2413
02:24:29.32 --> 02:24:30.32
I just running shorts.

2414
02:24:30.32 --> 02:24:32.92
You're pretty good to go.

2415
02:24:32.92 --> 02:24:34.08
You're pretty good to go.

2416
02:24:34.08 --> 02:24:35.84
Don't knock it till you try it.

2417
02:24:35.84 --> 02:24:38.12
Also, Jocquest and Supplements.

2418
02:24:38.12 --> 02:24:40.32

02:24:47.32 --> 02:24:48.32
Labs.

2426
02:24:48.32 --> 02:24:52.08
It says labs on the top of the menu.

2427
02:24:52.08 --> 02:24:53.08
What do you call it?

2428
02:24:53.08 --> 02:24:54.48
The top menu on the website.

2429
02:24:54.48 --> 02:24:55.48
Labs.

2430
02:24:55.48 --> 02:24:56.88
Super-crile.

2431
02:24:56.88 --> 02:24:57.88
Joint warfare.

2432
02:24:57.88 --> 02:24:59.24
Yes.

2433
02:24:59.24 --> 02:25:00.24
That's a big one.

2434
02:25:00.24 --> 02:25:01.88
I mean, we know Crile is like the base.

2435
02:25:01.88 --> 02:25:02.88
Yeah.

2436
02:25:02.88 --> 02:25:03.88
The joint warfare?

2437
02:25:03.88 --> 02:25:04.88
Yeah.

2438
02:25:04.88 --> 02:25:05.88
So good.

2439
02:25:05.88 --> 02:25:06.88
And the significance well, layers.

2440
02:25:06.88 --> 02:25:09.32
If you will, I think, you know, maybe that's a stretch with layers.

2441
02:25:09.32 --> 02:25:12.76
But this is the stuff that you've been taking from.

2442
02:25:12.76 --> 02:25:13.76
Yes.

2443
02:25:13.76 --> 02:25:14.76
Jump.

2444
02:25:14.76 --> 02:25:15.76
Yes.

2445
02:25:15.76 --> 02:25:17.48
Bonus.

2446
02:25:17.48 --> 02:25:18.48
Bonus stuff.

2447
02:25:18.48 --> 02:25:21.24
Bonus stuff that I now can take in one shot.

2448
02:25:21.24 --> 02:25:25.48
So like when you're even before this podcast and stuff, you're like taking glucose.

2449
02:25:25.48 --> 02:25:28.48
I mean, and Crile oil and all this stuff, you're like, you know, it would be make this

2450
02:25:28.48 --> 02:25:29.48
even better.

2451
02:25:29.48 --> 02:25:33.64
It's like, you know, this is those little elements for whatever.

2452
02:25:33.64 --> 02:25:36.36
And one day, you know, I'm going to make my own boom.

2453
02:25:36.36 --> 02:25:37.36
It happened.

2454
02:25:37.36 --> 02:25:38.36
It happened.

2455
02:25:38.36 --> 02:25:39.36
Yeah.

2456
02:25:39.36 --> 02:25:40.36
So we're in it.

2457
02:25:40.36 --> 02:25:41.36
Joint warfare.

2458
02:25:41.36 --> 02:25:42.36
That's a good one.

2459
02:25:42.36 --> 02:25:43.36
Super-crile.

2460
02:25:43.36 --> 02:25:44.36
It has a added thing, right?

2461
02:25:44.36 --> 02:25:45.36
And the Crile.

2462
02:25:45.36 --> 02:25:47.60
It's oil and it's super-crile.

2463
02:25:47.60 --> 02:25:48.60
Yeah.

2464
02:25:48.60 --> 02:25:49.60
Oh, that's it.

2465
02:25:49.60 --> 02:25:50.60
Super-crile.

2466
02:25:50.60 --> 02:25:51.60
Okay.

2467
02:25:51.60 --> 02:25:52.60
What else are you going to add?

2468
02:25:52.60 --> 02:25:54.60
It's already super.

2469
02:25:54.60 --> 02:25:55.60
Duper?

2470
02:25:55.60 --> 02:25:57.60
We could add Duper.

2471
02:25:57.60 --> 02:25:58.60
Yeah.

2472
02:25:58.60 --> 02:25:59.60
That'll be super-duper-crile.

2473
02:25:59.60 --> 02:26:02.40
So now he's going to take the market from us.

2474
02:26:02.40 --> 02:26:04.20
Rob Jones, super-duper-crile oil.

2475
02:26:04.20 --> 02:26:05.20
Just patting it.

2476
02:26:05.20 --> 02:26:09.000
Well, he does make things have a good website.

2477
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
That's what our handle.

2478
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
You have a domain.

2479
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
True.

2480
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:17.40
But yeah, so basically everything you need for the joint situation, your covered.

2481
02:26:17.40 --> 02:26:19.72
And then what about that pre-work?

2482
02:26:19.72 --> 02:26:20.72
Pre-mission.

2483
02:26:20.72 --> 02:26:21.72
Pre-mission.

2484
02:26:21.72 --> 02:26:22.72
Pre-mission.

2485
02:26:22.72 --> 02:26:23.72
It's coming.

2486
02:26:23.72 --> 02:26:24.72
Pre-work out.

2487
02:26:24.72 --> 02:26:25.72
It's coming.

2488
02:26:25.72 --> 02:26:26.72
Not available yet.

2489
02:26:26.72 --> 02:26:27.72
Pre-mission.

2490
02:26:27.72 --> 02:26:28.72
Well, we'll be coming.

2491
02:26:28.72 --> 02:26:29.72
Yeah.

2492
02:26:29.72 --> 02:26:30.72
It's going to talk about that one.

2493
02:26:30.72 --> 02:26:31.72
We're talking about it.

2494
02:26:31.72 --> 02:26:32.72
We are.

2495
02:26:32.72 --> 02:26:38.36
It is in the testing phase and has been being tested and legit.

2496
02:26:38.36 --> 02:26:39.36
All right.

2497
02:26:39.36 --> 02:26:40.36
So far so good.

2498
02:26:40.36 --> 02:26:41.36
Boom.

2499
02:26:41.36 --> 02:26:42.36
Okay.

2500
02:26:42.36 --> 02:26:43.36
Okay.

2501
02:26:43.36 --> 02:26:45.36
Also on it.

2502
02:26:45.36 --> 02:26:47.36
Dot com slash juggle.

2503
02:26:47.36 --> 02:26:48.36
Okay.

2504
02:26:48.36 --> 02:26:50.20
So I get all my kettlebells from on it.

2505
02:26:50.20 --> 02:26:55.76
I got into kettlebells after this podcast kind of started and you know, on it has

2506
02:26:55.76 --> 02:26:58.48
awesome stuff.

2507
02:26:58.48 --> 02:27:00.60
Specifically the kettlebells because they're the designer ones.

2508
02:27:00.60 --> 02:27:01.60
You've seen that kind of thing.

2509
02:27:01.60 --> 02:27:02.60
Yeah.

2510
02:27:02.60 --> 02:27:03.60
Yeah.

2511
02:27:03.60 --> 02:27:04.60
So I get the whole set.

2512
02:27:04.60 --> 02:27:06.000
Well, I don't have the whole set technically.

2513
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.64
I have the weight that I think I'm going to be able to use.

2514
02:27:08.64 --> 02:27:09.64
What's your heaviest one?

2515
02:27:09.64 --> 02:27:11.64
I don't know 40 kilograms.

2516
02:27:11.64 --> 02:27:13.64
What was that?

2517
02:27:13.64 --> 02:27:14.64
80.

2518
02:27:14.64 --> 02:27:15.64
80.

2519
02:27:15.64 --> 02:27:16.64
80 pounds.

2520
02:27:16.64 --> 02:27:18.64
That's cool, man.

2521
02:27:18.64 --> 02:27:19.64
Cool story.

2522
02:27:19.64 --> 02:27:20.64
I got the 90 pound one.

2523
02:27:20.64 --> 02:27:21.64
So whatever.

2524
02:27:21.64 --> 02:27:23.64
So basically all 88 pounds that you have.

2525
02:27:23.64 --> 02:27:24.64
I have that plus more.

2526
02:27:24.64 --> 02:27:25.64
Two more.

2527
02:27:25.64 --> 02:27:26.64
So no big deal.

2528
02:27:26.64 --> 02:27:27.64
Stand by.

2529
02:27:27.64 --> 02:27:28.64
One more.

2530
02:27:28.64 --> 02:27:29.64
There you go.

2531
02:27:29.64 --> 02:27:30.64
Good.

2532
02:27:30.64 --> 02:27:32.64
And what you are skinny jeans.

2533
02:27:32.64 --> 02:27:34.64
Joggers.

2534
02:27:34.64 --> 02:27:36.64
Contemporary joggers from time to time.

2535
02:27:36.64 --> 02:27:37.64
That's exactly four pounds.

2536
02:27:37.64 --> 02:27:40.64
You're actually kettlebell.

2537
02:27:40.64 --> 02:27:41.64
It's functional.

2538
02:27:41.64 --> 02:27:43.64
It adds it by the way.

2539
02:27:43.64 --> 02:27:46.64
Got the grill ones a few weeks ago.

2540
02:27:46.64 --> 02:27:49.64
The 90 pound one is the big foot.

2541
02:27:49.64 --> 02:27:52.64
Just for informational purpose.

2542
02:27:52.64 --> 02:27:54.64
They're ever going to make a hundred pound jokko head.

2543
02:27:54.64 --> 02:27:56.64
They said that, right?

2544
02:27:56.64 --> 02:27:57.64
People have been saying that.

2545
02:27:57.64 --> 02:27:58.64
There's been some requests.

2546
02:27:58.64 --> 02:28:01.64
I don't know if anyone would actually want that.

2547
02:28:01.64 --> 02:28:02.64
Yeah.

2548
02:28:02.64 --> 02:28:04.64
I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I sent me a tool.

2549
02:28:04.64 --> 02:28:08.64
It was a 250, 200 something pound kettlebell.

2550
02:28:08.64 --> 02:28:09.64
Dang.

2551
02:28:09.64 --> 02:28:11.64
I don't even know what I mean.

2552
02:28:11.64 --> 02:28:13.64
Yeah, I guess.

2553
02:28:13.64 --> 02:28:14.64
Right?

2554
02:28:14.64 --> 02:28:15.64
Goals.

2555
02:28:15.64 --> 02:28:17.64
There's like, you know, some people are just mutants strong.

2556
02:28:17.64 --> 02:28:18.64
Yeah.

2557
02:28:18.64 --> 02:28:20.64
One of my team guy buddies just mutants strong.

2558
02:28:20.64 --> 02:28:22.64
I ain't trying to get through great dude.

2559
02:28:22.64 --> 02:28:25.64
But he got the beast.

2560
02:28:25.64 --> 02:28:26.64
I don't know who makes it.

2561
02:28:26.64 --> 02:28:28.64
But there's a kettlebell called the beast.

2562
02:28:28.64 --> 02:28:31.64
I think it's like 102 pounds or something.

2563
02:28:31.64 --> 02:28:35.64
Yeah.

2564
02:28:35.64 --> 02:28:38.64
But there was like this little test taming the beast.

2565
02:28:38.64 --> 02:28:41.64
And he got the kettlebell out of the box.

2566
02:28:41.64 --> 02:28:43.64
Did the test pass it.

2567
02:28:43.64 --> 02:28:45.64
I was like, I mean, things that I couldn't do at all.

2568
02:28:45.64 --> 02:28:46.64
Yeah.

2569
02:28:46.64 --> 02:28:47.64
I was like, okay.

2570
02:28:47.64 --> 02:28:48.64
Yeah.

2571
02:28:48.64 --> 02:28:49.64
Actually, it's cool.

2572
02:28:49.64 --> 02:28:53.64
That's like one of those exercises that you if you learn that the form,

2573
02:28:53.64 --> 02:28:56.64
it's like the added element because you got to learn the form.

2574
02:28:56.64 --> 02:28:57.64
Yeah.

2575
02:28:57.64 --> 02:28:58.64
Then the strength.

2576
02:28:58.64 --> 02:29:00.64
And the learning the form is good for you because you're developing.

2577
02:29:00.64 --> 02:29:04.64
You're developing a neuro.

2578
02:29:04.64 --> 02:29:05.64
Right.

2579
02:29:05.64 --> 02:29:06.64
Muscular connections.

2580
02:29:06.64 --> 02:29:07.64
Yes.

2581
02:29:07.64 --> 02:29:08.64
Boom.

2582
02:29:08.64 --> 02:29:09.64
Thank you.

2583
02:29:09.64 --> 02:29:12.64
It was lost for words and you've had me cover and move.

2584
02:29:12.64 --> 02:29:13.64
Oh, my God.

2585
02:29:13.64 --> 02:29:14.64
But yeah.

2586
02:29:14.64 --> 02:29:17.64
So you know, it's basically you have to learn to balance something that's not balance.

2587
02:29:17.64 --> 02:29:18.64
Yeah.

2588
02:29:18.64 --> 02:29:19.64
It's good.

2589
02:29:19.64 --> 02:29:20.64
Like that bad I lifted in main.

2590
02:29:20.64 --> 02:29:22.64
This guy said, he's good.

2591
02:29:22.64 --> 02:29:24.64
200 pounds by the way.

2592
02:29:24.64 --> 02:29:25.64
No worries.

2593
02:29:25.64 --> 02:29:27.64
You know, it's super hard to feel the first time.

2594
02:29:27.64 --> 02:29:29.64
Also, they got what jump ropes.

2595
02:29:29.64 --> 02:29:31.64
But jump ropes, maces.

2596
02:29:31.64 --> 02:29:33.64
You know, if your workout gets boring,

2597
02:29:33.64 --> 02:29:35.64
and jogger doesn't have that problem, we know.

2598
02:29:35.64 --> 02:29:37.64
We know because you just want to carry it away and all this stuff.

2599
02:29:37.64 --> 02:29:39.64
But some people, they get bored, you know, with a workout,

2600
02:29:39.64 --> 02:29:41.64
you get all this cool stuff.

2601
02:29:41.64 --> 02:29:46.64
Anyway, on it dot com slash chocolate, so good on also.

On the other side.

2606
02:29:52.64 --> 02:29:53.64
Yeah.

2607
02:29:53.64 --> 02:29:53.64
It's nothing to buy.

2608
02:29:53.64 --> 02:29:54.64
It's free.

2609
02:29:54.64 --> 02:29:55.64

Big reaction.

2626

It is a legit way to support.

2627
02:30:24.64 --> 02:30:25.64
For sure.

2628
02:30:25.64 --> 02:30:26.64
It is.

2629
02:30:26.64 --> 02:30:27.64
I've got to ask that two times now.

2630
02:30:27.64 --> 02:30:28.64
Yeah.

2631
02:30:28.64 --> 02:30:29.64
Once in Maine.

2632
02:30:29.64 --> 02:30:33.64
And I think I was at an event the other day.

2633
02:30:33.64 --> 02:30:35.64
And someone asked me.

2634
02:30:35.64 --> 02:30:36.64
Does it really help?

2635
02:30:36.64 --> 02:30:38.64
There was like, yes it is.

2636
02:30:38.64 --> 02:30:41.64
It's, it's exactly what Echo says it is.

02:30:41.64 --> 02:30:42.64
Yeah.

2638
02:30:42.64 --> 02:30:43.64
Small action.

2639
02:30:43.64 --> 02:30:44.64
It takes what?

2640
02:30:44.64 --> 02:30:46.64
Like three extra seconds.

2641
02:30:46.64 --> 02:30:47.64
Yeah.

2642
02:30:47.64 --> 02:30:48.64
Small action.

2643
02:30:48.64 --> 02:30:49.64
Boom.

2644
02:30:49.64 --> 02:30:50.64

02:30:56.64 --> 02:30:57.64
Right.

02:30:57.64 --> 02:30:58.64
I do not subscribe.

2652
02:30:58.64 --> 02:30:59.64

02:31:00.64 --> 02:31:01.64
Yeah.

2655
02:31:01.64 --> 02:31:03.64
Anything that provides platforms to subscribe.

2656
02:31:03.64 --> 02:31:04.64
Good way to support.

2657
02:31:04.64 --> 02:31:05.64

2658
02:31:05.64 --> 02:31:06.64

We have YouTube channel.

2661
02:31:08.64 --> 02:31:09.64
I put it.

2662
02:31:09.64 --> 02:31:11.64
What's the last video I put on there?

2663
02:31:11.64 --> 02:31:13.64
The book video.

2664
02:31:13.64 --> 02:31:14.64
Oh yeah.

2665
02:31:14.64 --> 02:31:16.64
This is a little freedom.

2666
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:17.64
Feel manual.

2667
02:31:17.64 --> 02:31:18.64
Video.

2668
02:31:18.64 --> 02:31:19.64
Awesome job on that by the way.

2669
02:31:19.64 --> 02:31:20.64
Well, thank you.

2670
02:31:20.64 --> 02:31:21.64
Pretty good video.

2671
02:31:21.64 --> 02:31:22.64
I don't know.

2672
02:31:22.64 --> 02:31:23.64
I thought it was pretty good too.

2673
02:31:23.64 --> 02:31:24.64
Yeah.

2674
02:31:24.64 --> 02:31:25.64
I felt jock with it all the work.

2675
02:31:25.64 --> 02:31:26.64
Really lifting.

2676
02:31:26.64 --> 02:31:27.64
That was a hard night too.

2677
02:31:27.64 --> 02:31:30.64
I mean, you're lifting after like a whole day.

2678
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:31.64
I was like, bro.

2679
02:31:31.64 --> 02:31:32.64
Yeah.

2680
02:31:32.64 --> 02:31:33.64
That was like a long day.

2681
02:31:33.64 --> 02:31:34.64
You're a long day.

2682
02:31:34.64 --> 02:31:38.64
You know, he's the kind where I'm like, okay, just need like the shots.

2683
02:31:38.64 --> 02:31:39.64
You know, because we're doing it for like other stuff.

2684
02:31:39.64 --> 02:31:42.64
And I'm going to grab the stills and whatever.

2685
02:31:42.64 --> 02:31:43.64
And I was like, I just need the shots.

2686
02:31:43.64 --> 02:31:45.64
What I'll do is I'll make it here.

2687
02:31:45.64 --> 02:31:46.64
So you don't have to put on all that weight.

2688
02:31:46.64 --> 02:31:49.64
And he's like, no, I'll feel like I'm put the weight.

2689
02:31:49.64 --> 02:31:50.64
I was like, right, you're the man.

2690
02:31:50.64 --> 02:31:53.64
I just say he's like, I think I was just shooting a video.

2691
02:31:53.64 --> 02:31:54.64
Doing lifting weights.

2692
02:31:54.64 --> 02:31:56.64
And they're like, yeah, we're just going to do it with no way.

2693
02:31:56.64 --> 02:32:02.64
I'm like, no, but the video that I want the weight that I want to be on there is 135 pounds.

2694
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:03.64
I want that to be on video.

2695
02:32:03.64 --> 02:32:05.64
I don't want no weight to be on video.

2696
02:32:05.64 --> 02:32:06.64
Yeah.

2697
02:32:06.64 --> 02:32:11.64
He even went one further is that there was a few shots that I was getting that didn't show how much weight.

2698
02:32:11.64 --> 02:32:13.64
It just showed that front of the, you know, it was like an angle.

2699
02:32:13.64 --> 02:32:15.64
You could kind of see part of the way.

2700
02:32:15.64 --> 02:32:16.64
Kind of he's like, no.

2701
02:32:16.64 --> 02:32:17.64
He's like he wouldn't allow him.

2702
02:32:17.64 --> 02:32:21.64
Well, I actually said, you know, I took the Rob Jones approach.

2703
02:32:21.64 --> 02:32:23.64
I was like, okay, I got to move some weight around.

2704
02:32:23.64 --> 02:32:26.64
I'm going to use the opportunity to make myself better.

2705
02:32:26.64 --> 02:32:27.64
I got to work out.

2706
02:32:27.64 --> 02:32:28.64
I was getting after it.

2707
02:32:28.64 --> 02:32:29.64
He's a method after that.

2708
02:32:29.64 --> 02:32:30.64
Yeah.

2709
02:32:30.64 --> 02:32:31.64
He's actually right.

2710
02:32:31.64 --> 02:32:32.64
Yeah.

2711
02:32:32.64 --> 02:32:33.64
Hey, worked out for him.

2712
02:32:33.64 --> 02:32:34.64
And I dig it.

2713
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:36.64
But yeah, the last back to YouTube boom.

2714
02:32:36.64 --> 02:32:38.64
We put some videos on there.

2715
02:32:38.64 --> 02:32:42.64
Including not limited to the video version of this podcast.

2716
02:32:42.64 --> 02:32:45.64
Also additional videos, excerpts.

2717
02:32:45.64 --> 02:32:48.64
You know, in various other videos, deleted scenes, if you will.

2718
02:32:48.64 --> 02:32:51.64
A lot of times we talk rubbish before we actually.

2719
02:32:51.64 --> 02:32:56.64
We include, you know, or we don't include in the podcast.

2720
02:32:56.64 --> 02:32:59.64
So sometimes we'll cut that up and put it on there.

2721
02:32:59.64 --> 02:33:01.64
To add it entertainment, you know, hear Jockel swear a lot.

2722
02:33:01.64 --> 02:33:05.64
You know, he doesn't swear that much on on on the record.

2723
02:33:05.64 --> 02:33:09.64
But, you know, he gets after it from time to time.

2724
02:33:09.64 --> 02:33:13.64
Also, I'm hanging out with like one of my brothers.

2725
02:33:13.64 --> 02:33:15.64
Yeah, he's you know.

2726
02:33:15.64 --> 02:33:16.64
Well, yeah.

2727
02:33:16.64 --> 02:33:17.64
Yeah.

2728
02:33:17.64 --> 02:33:18.64
You don't f in just f in getting nuts.

2729
02:33:18.64 --> 02:33:20.64
We f in squats in your f in thing.

2730
02:33:20.64 --> 02:33:23.64
He was like, yeah, he like overdid it.

2731
02:33:23.64 --> 02:33:25.64
None the last.

2732
02:33:25.64 --> 02:33:26.64
Yeah, YouTube.

2733
02:33:26.64 --> 02:33:27.64
That's a good one.

2734
02:33:27.64 --> 02:33:29.64
Also, Jockel has a store.

2735
02:33:29.64 --> 02:33:32.64
If you didn't already know, guess what is called?

2736
02:33:32.64 --> 02:33:33.64
I want to go on a limb.

2737
02:33:33.64 --> 02:33:34.64
Say Jockel store.

2738
02:33:34.64 --> 02:33:35.64
Jockel store.

2739
02:33:35.64 --> 02:33:36.64
That Jockel store dot com.

2740
02:33:36.64 --> 02:33:38.64
We got some t-shirts on there.

2741
02:33:38.64 --> 02:33:39.64
They're cool.

2742
02:33:39.64 --> 02:33:39.64
They're cool.

2743
02:33:39.64 --> 02:33:41.64
Little, you know, some layers on those t-shirts.

2744
02:33:41.64 --> 02:33:43.64
Layers meaning not physical layers.

2745
02:33:43.64 --> 02:33:46.64
We call poetic layers.

2746
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:47.64
poetic.

2747
02:33:47.64 --> 02:33:48.64
On poetic.

2748
02:33:48.64 --> 02:33:49.64
On poetic.

2749
02:33:49.64 --> 02:33:51.64
Yeah, it's reaching a lot.

2750
02:33:51.64 --> 02:33:52.64
Thanks.

2751
02:33:52.64 --> 02:33:53.64
Good.

2752
02:33:53.64 --> 02:33:54.64
It's pretty poetic.

2753
02:33:54.64 --> 02:33:55.64
Get it right into that.

2754
02:33:55.64 --> 02:33:57.64
That's a son of the.

2755
02:33:57.64 --> 02:33:58.64
Little memory.

2756
02:33:58.64 --> 02:33:59.64
I love that one myself.

2757
02:33:59.64 --> 02:34:01.64
You know what the layers are with that though, right?

2758
02:34:01.64 --> 02:34:03.64
If you look at the good shirt, it has Jockel's head.

2759
02:34:03.64 --> 02:34:04.64
Yeah.

2760
02:34:04.64 --> 02:34:05.64
That's good, right?

2761
02:34:05.64 --> 02:34:06.64
But the good is backwards.

2762
02:34:06.64 --> 02:34:07.64
And here's the thing.

2763
02:34:07.64 --> 02:34:09.64
That's why when people try to counterfeit that one,

2764
02:34:09.64 --> 02:34:10.64
they don't get the layers.

2765
02:34:10.64 --> 02:34:11.64
They just see Jockel's head.

2766
02:34:11.64 --> 02:34:12.64
Oh, literal.

2767
02:34:12.64 --> 02:34:14.64
That's a marketing thing or whatever.

2768
02:34:14.64 --> 02:34:15.64
Yeah.

2769
02:34:15.64 --> 02:34:16.64
And let's sell that, but they don't get it.

2770
02:34:16.64 --> 02:34:17.64
They don't know the layers.

2771
02:34:17.64 --> 02:34:18.64
So the good is backwards and backwards for a reason.

2772
02:34:18.64 --> 02:34:20.64
They can rate it in the mirror.

2773
02:34:20.64 --> 02:34:22.64
Because who are you saying that when you hear that,

2774
02:34:22.64 --> 02:34:23.64
who are you saying that to?

2775
02:34:23.64 --> 02:34:26.64
You're not saying, you know, to your poor daughter who's crying,

2776
02:34:26.64 --> 02:34:28.64
because she's skimmed her knee, you know,

2777
02:34:28.64 --> 02:34:29.64
to a good.

2778
02:34:29.64 --> 02:34:30.64
She's like, oh, she cries more.

2779
02:34:30.64 --> 02:34:31.64
That's not her man.

2780
02:34:31.64 --> 02:34:32.64
Yeah.

2781
02:34:32.64 --> 02:34:33.64
It's not your message to give somebody else.

2782
02:34:33.64 --> 02:34:34.64
Your message to give to you.

2783
02:34:34.64 --> 02:34:36.64
Well, I'm letting your daughter cry in the first place.

2784
02:34:36.64 --> 02:34:38.64
Well, she's, you know, sensitive.

2785
02:34:38.64 --> 02:34:40.64
I'm cultivating her sensitive side.

2786
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:41.64
That's all.

2787
02:34:41.64 --> 02:34:45.64
You're not wearing any t-shirt for your self to look down like that.

2788
02:34:45.64 --> 02:34:48.64
We're in it. So other people can rate it.

2789
02:34:48.64 --> 02:34:51.64
You can rate it in a typical case, but not these t-shirts.

2790
02:34:51.64 --> 02:34:53.64
That t-shirt is for you.

2791
02:34:53.64 --> 02:34:54.64
Oh, great.

2792
02:34:54.64 --> 02:34:56.64
For you with the message with Jocquist face.

2793
02:34:56.64 --> 02:34:58.64
Apparently that's for you too.

2794
02:34:58.64 --> 02:35:00.64
Not for everybody, but this is for you.

2795
02:35:00.64 --> 02:35:03.64
Nonetheless, that's just an example of the layers.

2796
02:35:03.64 --> 02:35:04.64
On the shirt.

2797
02:35:04.64 --> 02:35:05.64
Jocquistork.com.

2798
02:35:05.64 --> 02:35:06.64
There's also some hoodies on there.

2799
02:35:06.64 --> 02:35:07.64
Some travel modes.

2800
02:35:07.64 --> 02:35:09.64
Bumper stickers.

2801
02:35:09.64 --> 02:35:12.64
The Jocquist 2016 took it off.

2802
02:35:12.64 --> 02:35:15.64
Yeah, we lost that election.

2803
02:35:15.64 --> 02:35:16.64
Yeah, you did.

2804
02:35:16.64 --> 02:35:17.64
I probably got like 27 votes.

2805
02:35:17.64 --> 02:35:18.64
Yeah.

2806
02:35:18.64 --> 02:35:19.64
I got some legit votes.

2807
02:35:19.64 --> 02:35:20.64
People posted them on Twitter.

2808
02:35:20.64 --> 02:35:22.64
So people broke me in straight up.

2809
02:35:22.64 --> 02:35:23.64
They wrote me in.

2810
02:35:23.64 --> 02:35:24.64
I did.

2811
02:35:24.64 --> 02:35:25.64
You know what?

2812
02:35:25.64 --> 02:35:27.64
I don't want Hillary Clinton.

2813
02:35:27.64 --> 02:35:29.64
I don't want Donald Trump.

2814
02:35:29.64 --> 02:35:30.64
Oh, John Juan.

2815
02:35:30.64 --> 02:35:31.64
Yeah.

2816
02:35:31.64 --> 02:35:33.64
I think it might have been a good choice, actually.

2817
02:35:33.64 --> 02:35:35.64
I think I think it might have been a good choice.

2818
02:35:35.64 --> 02:35:38.64
Yeah, someone actually told me that I should run for vice president.

2819
02:35:38.64 --> 02:35:40.64
That wouldn't have been a good choice.

2820
02:35:40.64 --> 02:35:41.64
Yeah.

2821
02:35:41.64 --> 02:35:43.64
I don't know if you would have got my vote.

2822
02:35:43.64 --> 02:35:44.64
No, no, no.

2823
02:35:44.64 --> 02:35:47.64
I wouldn't have got my vote.

2824
02:35:47.64 --> 02:35:50.64
Nonetheless, there's some cool stuff on Jocquistork.

2825
02:35:50.64 --> 02:35:52.64
That's the point.

2826
02:35:52.64 --> 02:35:54.64
You know, I'm not saying go buy some stuff.

2827
02:35:54.64 --> 02:35:55.64
I'm saying go on there.

2828
02:35:55.64 --> 02:35:57.64
See what's on there.

2829
02:35:57.64 --> 02:36:00.64
And if you like something, get something.

2830
02:36:00.64 --> 02:36:01.64
Good way to support.

2831
02:36:01.64 --> 02:36:04.64
Also, there's a little thing called psychological warfare.

2832
02:36:04.64 --> 02:36:05.64
You ever do it?

2833
02:36:05.64 --> 02:36:06.64
Yeah, I have.

2834
02:36:06.64 --> 02:36:07.64
It's pretty dope.

2835
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:08.64
I'll tell you what.

2836
02:36:08.64 --> 02:36:13.64
Today, okay, so I don't have to let you know that it's an album with tracks.

2837
02:36:13.64 --> 02:36:14.64
Jocquist tracks.

2838
02:36:14.64 --> 02:36:18.64
So basically, if you don't already know Rob Jones, no, it's Jocquist.

2839
02:36:18.64 --> 02:36:20.64
I know obviously.

2840
02:36:20.64 --> 02:36:26.64
Let's say you're on your campaign against weakness.

2841
02:36:26.64 --> 02:36:29.64
That's the official going turn campaign against weakness.

2842
02:36:29.64 --> 02:36:30.64
Right.

2843
02:36:30.64 --> 02:36:33.64
And I'm going to be disciplined in all these areas on my life.

2844
02:36:33.64 --> 02:36:34.64
Waking up early, diet.

2845
02:36:34.64 --> 02:36:37.64
I'm going to work out, you know, however many times a day.

2846
02:36:37.64 --> 02:36:40.64
Study, study, get smarter, work harder.

2847
02:36:40.64 --> 02:36:41.64
Yeah, just normal stuff.

2848
02:36:41.64 --> 02:36:45.64
Yeah, normal getting after you can't be campaign.

2849
02:36:45.64 --> 02:36:46.64
Yeah.

2850
02:36:46.64 --> 02:36:51.64
And you have a moment of weakness like Jocquist with the mint chocolate chip.

2851
02:36:51.64 --> 02:36:53.64
Thanks, cream.

2852
02:36:53.64 --> 02:36:54.64
Avoid that.

2853
02:36:54.64 --> 02:36:57.64
Jocquist didn't listen to his own album with tracks.

2854
02:36:57.64 --> 02:36:58.64
Jocquist tracks.

2855
02:36:58.64 --> 02:36:59.64
I was like a logic warfare.

2856
02:36:59.64 --> 02:37:03.64
What you do is, in time you come across these moments of weakness.

2857
02:37:03.64 --> 02:37:05.64
Listen, put a track, put a track in.

2858
02:37:05.64 --> 02:37:08.64
Like if you're having hard time waking up, you want to hit this news, whatever boom.

2859
02:37:08.64 --> 02:37:10.64
Wake up, get up, wake up, wake up.

2860
02:37:10.64 --> 02:37:11.64
Wake up and get after it.

2861
02:37:11.64 --> 02:37:12.64
That's the track name.

2862
02:37:12.64 --> 02:37:14.64
Help you right through that weakness.

2863
02:37:14.64 --> 02:37:16.64
Smash the weakness, actually.

2864
02:37:16.64 --> 02:37:19.64
Yeah, psychological warfare, Jocquist, Lillink.

2865
02:37:19.64 --> 02:37:21.64
MP3, iTunes.

2866
02:37:21.64 --> 02:37:23.64
Wherever, MP3s are being distributed.

2867
02:37:23.64 --> 02:37:25.64
That's where you can get them.

2868
02:37:25.64 --> 02:37:28.64
Uh, you can also on Amazon.

2869
02:37:28.64 --> 02:37:31.64
You can get something called Jocquist.

2870
02:37:31.64 --> 02:37:33.64
Rob Jones had his first Jocquist.

2871
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:38.64
The list is not only the list, but I've noticed you've been very attentive.

2872
02:37:38.64 --> 02:37:41.64
Your words are crisp and clear.

2873
02:37:41.64 --> 02:37:43.64
I mean, you feel the power, right?

2874
02:37:43.64 --> 02:37:44.64
Yeah.

2875
02:37:44.64 --> 02:37:45.64
Look at him.

2876
02:37:45.64 --> 02:37:46.64
It totally encroached.

2877
02:37:46.64 --> 02:37:47.64
Get him.

2878
02:37:47.64 --> 02:37:49.64
He's ready to rock and roll.

2879
02:37:49.64 --> 02:37:50.64
To nasty.

2880
02:37:50.64 --> 02:37:51.64
Yep.

2881
02:37:51.64 --> 02:37:54.64
My, uh, mental capacity increased at least tenfold.

2882
02:37:54.64 --> 02:37:55.64
Yeah.

2883
02:37:55.64 --> 02:37:56.64
If not more.

2884
02:37:56.64 --> 02:37:57.64
So there you go.

2885
02:37:57.64 --> 02:37:59.64
Jocquist, you can get that on Amazon.

2886
02:37:59.64 --> 02:38:01.64
It takes legit though.

2887
02:38:01.64 --> 02:38:02.64
How good is it taste?

2888
02:38:02.64 --> 02:38:03.64
Oh, it's really good.

2889
02:38:03.64 --> 02:38:06.64
Yeah, it's, it's, and it doesn't, it doesn't really taste like tea.

2890
02:38:06.64 --> 02:38:07.64
Right?

2891
02:38:07.64 --> 02:38:09.64
It's like kind of taste like tea.

2892
02:38:09.64 --> 02:38:11.64
Does he have any sugar in it?

2893
02:38:11.64 --> 02:38:12.64
No.

2894
02:38:12.64 --> 02:38:15.64
You tell me, Jocquist, he doesn't have any sugar and taste like good.

2895
02:38:15.64 --> 02:38:16.64
And it tastes that good.

2896
02:38:16.64 --> 02:38:17.64
What is it taste like?

2897
02:38:17.64 --> 02:38:20.64
It tastes like victory.

2898
02:38:20.64 --> 02:38:24.64
Uh, then we got some books on Amazon and wherever you want to buy books.

2899
02:38:24.64 --> 02:38:28.64
Extreme ownership, combat lesson, combat leadership lessons learned.

2900
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:31.64
And how you can apply those to business and life.

2901
02:38:31.64 --> 02:38:35.64
Way of the warrior kid.

2902
02:38:35.64 --> 02:38:36.64
Yeah.

2903
02:38:36.64 --> 02:38:37.64
Way of the warrior kid.

2904
02:38:37.64 --> 02:38:40.64
That's what you need to get for every kid, you know.

2905
02:38:40.64 --> 02:38:42.64
It is so helpful for kids.

2906
02:38:42.64 --> 02:38:46.64
I wish I had that book when I was nine years old.

2907
02:38:46.64 --> 02:38:48.64
Ten years old, eleven years old.

2908
02:38:48.64 --> 02:38:49.64
It.

2909
02:38:49.64 --> 02:38:50.64

2910
02:38:50.64 --> 02:38:52.64

2911
02:38:52.64 --> 02:38:55.64

2914

The discipline equals freedom field manual.

2915
02:39:05.64 --> 02:39:06.64
That's right.

2916
02:39:06.64 --> 02:39:08.64
It is a field manual.

2917
02:39:08.64 --> 02:39:14.64
How to implement and execute operation discipline into your life.

2918
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:16.64
Follow the field manual.

02:39:16.64 --> 02:39:19.64

2929

Rob Jones is at Rob Jones journey.

2930
02:40:05.64 --> 02:40:07.64
At Rob Jones journey.

2931
02:40:07.64 --> 02:40:10.64
He's going to be documenting all this.

2932
02:40:10.64 --> 02:40:11.64
Awesome.

2933
02:40:11.64 --> 02:40:16.64
Slash could be stupid, but could be mostly awesome stuff that he's doing.

2934
02:40:16.64 --> 02:40:18.64
And we like to watch people be crazy stuff.

2935
02:40:18.64 --> 02:40:21.64
So we're going to watch you do that.

2936
02:40:21.64 --> 02:40:25.64
And I'll post a picture and usually I like to put a little snippet of wisdom in there.

2937
02:40:25.64 --> 02:40:26.64
There's a little paragraph.

2938
02:40:26.64 --> 02:40:27.64
People to read.

2939
02:40:27.64 --> 02:40:28.64
Nice.

2940
02:40:28.64 --> 02:40:29.64
So the New York Times.

2941
02:40:29.64 --> 02:40:31.64
Yeah, don't do that.

2942
02:40:31.64 --> 02:40:34.64
Just go straight to the Rob Jones snippet of wisdom.

2943
02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:36.64
I like the example.

2944
02:40:36.64 --> 02:40:38.64
You see, you want to be the example.

2945
02:40:38.64 --> 02:40:40.64
Because some people, they say, I just want to be the example.

2946
02:40:40.64 --> 02:40:41.64
They don't explain it.

2947
02:40:41.64 --> 02:40:45.64
You just explained it actually in a way that was kind of revealing to me where it makes sense.

2948
02:40:45.64 --> 02:40:48.64
You're like, hey, I'm going to, and this goes for everything, by the way.

2949
02:40:48.64 --> 02:40:51.64
I want to do a special effects sometimes.

2950
02:40:51.64 --> 02:40:52.64
Yeah.

2951
02:40:52.64 --> 02:40:54.64
I want to do this, but man, that's like some high enough.

2952
02:40:54.64 --> 02:40:55.64
I can't do it on this.

2953
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:58.64
And then, but then, let's say, look it up on YouTube.

2954
02:40:58.64 --> 02:41:00.64
And be like, oh, wait, look, he did it right here.

2955
02:41:00.64 --> 02:41:02.64
And then, you know, sometimes it's a showhouse sometimes.

2956
02:41:02.64 --> 02:41:03.64
They don't.

2957
02:41:03.64 --> 02:41:09.64
But like, how you said, like, if you don't think, like, if you think, oh, yeah, that kind of can't be done.

2958
02:41:09.64 --> 02:41:10.64
Yeah.

2959
02:41:10.64 --> 02:41:12.64
Like, for so many of my position or whatever, you know.

2960
02:41:12.64 --> 02:41:14.64
But then you see some of the way he's doing it.

2961
02:41:14.64 --> 02:41:16.64
And then you're doing it where it's like, you're doing even more.

2962
02:41:16.64 --> 02:41:19.64
So it's like, oh, you're kind of reaching more people in that way.

2963
02:41:19.64 --> 02:41:23.64
Because still, if you're doing these crazy things, maybe one, maybe two other people.

2964
02:41:23.64 --> 02:41:25.64
Like, yeah, I can do that too.

2965
02:41:25.64 --> 02:41:27.64
But most people will be like, all right, I can do that.

2966
02:41:27.64 --> 02:41:28.64
Easy stuff.

2967
02:41:28.64 --> 02:41:29.64
But I can do all this other stuff.

2968
02:41:29.64 --> 02:41:30.64
You know what I mean?

2969
02:41:30.64 --> 02:41:32.64
Other stuff that they didn't think they could do before.

2970
02:41:32.64 --> 02:41:33.64
That's the word.

2971
02:41:33.64 --> 02:41:34.64
That's the word.

2972
02:41:34.64 --> 02:41:35.64
Crazy.

2973
02:41:35.64 --> 02:41:36.64
That's stupid.

2974
02:41:36.64 --> 02:41:37.64
The stuff you're doing is awesome.

2975
02:41:37.64 --> 02:41:37.64
Yeah.

2976
02:41:37.64 --> 02:41:38.64
It's crazy.

2977
02:41:38.64 --> 02:41:40.64
You've got to be crazy to do it.

2978
02:41:40.64 --> 02:41:43.64
So yeah, Rob Jones journey.

2979
02:41:43.64 --> 02:41:50.64

2980
02:41:50.64 --> 02:41:58.64
page for when you're starting all this all this 31 marifons in 31 days.

2981
02:41:58.64 --> 02:42:04.64
Most people run a marathon and I think I've read it takes like six months to actually recover from

2982
02:42:04.64 --> 02:42:05.64
a marathon.

2983
02:42:05.64 --> 02:42:08.64
Yeah, I guess it depends on your level of preparedness.

2984
02:42:08.64 --> 02:42:09.64
Yeah.

2985
02:42:09.64 --> 02:42:11.64
Trying to do it in about six hours.

2986
02:42:11.64 --> 02:42:15.64
That is awesome.

2987
02:42:15.64 --> 02:42:19.64
Echo is at Echo Charles in I am at Jocca willing.

2988
02:42:19.64 --> 02:42:21.64
Echo, you got anything else for today.

2989
02:42:21.64 --> 02:42:25.64
Thank you for coming on Rob Jones.

2990
02:42:25.64 --> 02:42:28.64
Rob, any closing thoughts from you?

2991
02:42:28.64 --> 02:42:35.64
I just want to start by pointing out that I think every guest you've ever had on this podcast

2992
02:42:35.64 --> 02:42:39.64
is somebody that I consider to be a hero.

2993
02:42:39.64 --> 02:42:44.64
And I don't throw that around their patriots and they are heroes.

2994
02:42:44.64 --> 02:42:52.64
And it is humbling for me to be included for you to have me on the podcast is vastly humbling

2995
02:42:52.64 --> 02:42:58.64
for me to be included among the people that you deem worthy of being on the podcast.

2996
02:42:58.64 --> 02:43:04.64
So I just want to thank both of you for having me and giving me this opportunity.

2997
02:43:04.64 --> 02:43:10.64
I just hope that some of the stuff that I said can resonate with with some of the listeners.

2998
02:43:10.64 --> 02:43:15.64
And beyond that, I've been a lot of stuff.

2999
02:43:15.64 --> 02:43:20.64
But nobody does that by themselves.

3000
02:43:20.64 --> 02:43:23.64
I have had so many people that have helped me.

3001
02:43:23.64 --> 02:43:31.64
Therapist, prosthesis, coaches, mentors, and family, friends.

3002
02:43:31.64 --> 02:43:34.64
And then especially Pam.

3003
02:43:34.64 --> 02:43:39.64
I mean, I told you before she's doing everything.

3004
02:43:39.64 --> 02:43:44.64
She was instrumental in getting this podcast done getting me on as a guest here.

3005
02:43:44.64 --> 02:43:49.64
Took it upon herself to tweet you.

3006
02:43:49.64 --> 02:43:50.64
She's calling press.

3007
02:43:50.64 --> 02:43:52.64
She's helping me get venue.

3008
02:43:52.64 --> 02:43:54.64
She's been incredible.

3009
02:43:54.64 --> 02:43:57.64
And she's my number one supporter.

3010
02:43:57.64 --> 02:44:01.64
And you know, too good for me.

3011
02:44:01.64 --> 02:44:03.64
Hopefully she doesn't listen to that.

3012
02:44:03.64 --> 02:44:07.64
Hopefully she'll still continue to be diluted.

3013
02:44:07.64 --> 02:44:13.64
But yeah, I mean, I'm at the top of the pyramid.

3014
02:44:13.64 --> 02:44:19.64
Like I get all the kind of the notoriety and the congratulations for doing the stuff that I've done.

3015
02:44:19.64 --> 02:44:22.64
But without the base of the pyramid, the pyramid is shit.

3016
02:44:22.64 --> 02:44:29.64
I'm just blocking that ground. So without all these people, I mean, I wouldn't have accomplished it.

3017
02:44:29.64 --> 02:44:33.64
I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have tried, but I wouldn't be where I am.

3018
02:44:33.64 --> 02:44:34.64
I wouldn't be on the podcast.

3019
02:44:34.64 --> 02:44:37.64
I wouldn't have actually done anything.

3020
02:44:37.64 --> 02:44:51.64
Well, you know, for everyone that's come on and sit here and have you, you know, that to have you and the people that have come on this podcast and have you sitting across the table from me and be able to spend time with you yesterday and hang out with you.

3021
02:44:51.64 --> 02:45:00.64
I am rewarded a thousand fold a thousand fold from you to me.

3022
02:45:00.64 --> 02:45:02.64
That's where the reward comes.

3023
02:45:02.64 --> 02:45:08.64
And it's an honor a thousand fold for you to be here and be sitting here talking to me.

3024
02:45:08.64 --> 02:45:12.64
And I thank you for coming on.

3025
02:45:12.64 --> 02:45:15.64
I thank you for your service.

3026
02:45:15.64 --> 02:45:20.64
I thank you for your sacrifice.

3027
02:45:20.64 --> 02:45:25.64
I thank you for the example that you're setting, which is awesome.

3028
02:45:25.64 --> 02:45:35.64
And showing everyone what it really means to, to persevere.

3029
02:45:35.64 --> 02:45:50.32
And to not only, not only overcome challenges, but you are embracing those challenges and turning the harshest of challenges in

3030
02:45:50.32 --> 02:45:57.32
to something positive and something good.

3031
02:45:57.32 --> 02:46:06.32
And that is what I'm thanking you for for explaining what it really means to adapt and overcome no matter what we face.

3032
02:46:06.32 --> 02:46:12.32
And to everyone out there, that's listening.

3033
02:46:12.32 --> 02:46:21.32
And you're going through hard times or you're facing a rough patch or a challenge or an obstacle in your life.

3034
02:46:21.32 --> 02:46:23.32
Adapt to it.

3035
02:46:23.32 --> 02:46:25.32
Grow from it.

3036
02:46:25.32 --> 02:46:28.32
Overcommit.

3037
02:46:28.32 --> 02:46:31.32
Transcend it.

3038
02:46:31.32 --> 02:46:41.32
And use the weight of that challenge to make you stronger.

3039
02:46:41.32 --> 02:46:51.32
And until next time, this is Rob Jones and Echo and Jocco out.
