and that's that's that's that's a that's awesome 101 more stuff I stole from hack hack with 101 several adjuncts to morale chart three good management we all like to be in a unit where things run smoothly where things are planned where men do not have to hurry up and wait adequate information men like to be kept informed ahead of time of things that affect them or are act to affect them it is far better to for the commander to keep his men informed that have the men seek to get such information from rumors high state of training if a unit is not well trained it's men know it this fact shakes their confidence especially if they anticipate the possibility of using that training in a critical situation chances for advancement progress is morale raising to all men knowing that advancement is possible and that excellent performance and preparation lead to promotion helps morale good physical and mental condition good physical condition goes hand in hand with good mental condition these two elements are basic to achieving good morale good administration men like to know that they're paying accounts and individual records are correct confidence and equipment are is the best equipment best equipment army in the world confidence and commanders men expect their commanders to know their jobs to share the hardships with them and to take a personal interest in their problems you will not know whether a particular officer or soldier has a problem until someone has heard his case a willing ear will gain much confidence comfortable quarters I'm paraphrasing some of these mess good food mail service medical attention post exchange facilities leaves and passes religious services and character guidance it is especially important that a army be made up of mostly young soldiers be provided with facilities for religious services in accordance with their preferences a program of character guidance will help to continue in the service the whole some influence of home and community life awards and letters of commendation standards soldiers like to be in a sharp unit they appreciate achievement of high standards in discipline dress house keeping police maintenance training and athletics but lifting morale that comes from impressive and well executed military ceremonies is an important factor that can remind you like group heaties you know and the team and everyone like hates group heaties like crumbles like our group group heaties but if you don't know that it can be a problem back to the book so morale must be high enough to stand the shock and the boredom of combat every man must be strong must strongly believe that what he is doing is right he must have supreme confidence that he can deal with any situation that he is a better fighter than the enemy a spree decor is unit morale every man must feel that his unit is a superb fighting unit and that he like the rest will sacrifice even life itself for the unit the spirit is often the difference between mediocre and superior armies it was strong in the robin legions and the French troops under Napoleon recognize though that the commander must inspire beyond the group a spree only deep personal conviction springing from the identification with a cause will drive a man forward when his unit is destroyed or scattered personal example the commander should be a model soldier he must master the technique of war as it fits his assignment he must improve and expand his technical knowledge the commander must strive to make it possible for every soldier to say truthfully the old man knows the old man always knows the right thing to do in addition he must exhibit daily a fine example of stamina and courage besides his own example the higher commander is also represented by his staff officers they too must reflect the superior qualities of their commander above all set the proper example leading by example there you go the model soldier soldiers morale show me a unit that is well run properly trained and ready for combat and I'll show you a unit with high morale no commander will readily admit that his units morale is anything other than next I wrote the leadership strategy in tax people is asking how do I improve do hard things you unimproven morale do hard things as we compare units however it is often obvious that morale in some units is more excellent than in others what is morale our manual on leadership defines morale is the mental and emotional state of the individual although it is a complex and intangible quality the manifestations of its absence in a unit can be detected readily in the form of poor appearance of the individuals of the individuals and unit area poor discipline and a low state of training that's something I mean obviously a high worth immediately applied that you know to the the hard from the hard luck to the hardcore for Italian and I was thinking about that with task and bruiser something that we talk about often which is you know the initially we were working hard than everybody you know people were working hard than we were preparing for scenarios that we the guys had been to Iraq previously like what why are we training for this crazy multi-cash little scenario you know that we we didn't experience anything like that on the on the battlefield or when the instructors say hey you guys are good to go hey we're so focused on ourselves I'm focused on how tired I am I don't know how tired this guy is all I have really is his external what he's doing or looking like but if the other guy's just like cruising in his face like he's really comfortable you're like man I can't compete with this at all so now you want to give up even more you can never like the joke about normal face is no joke man it really isn't it really truly isn't and you talk about you talk about you know like when how many times have you seen me like we're doing jujitsu or even not you training with me but me training with anybody me training with Dean Lish you know training with somebody that's better than me that's given me a run have you ever seen like a look on my face of just like despair and we went bought you a big like Danny slam burger you know like double cheese burger like we're gonna go let's go see jokbo you just had a surgery and we roll up there and you were just and you were like normal I knew you were hurt back as you did like like just set it down over there like you were still like normal face and I don't know what you looked like before we walked in there and he's telling his corner caught him off he's done caught my gloves off I'm done and basically his corners like you got you know you got to keep going and they look over the other guy didn't answer the bell so like that's that's where it's at like if you you can give up right there that's something to think about you know like can you just go a little bit more can you just go a little bit more back to the book in combat you really see the critical importance of high morale and a speed of core morale must be high enough to stand the shock and boredom of combat you know actually before I continue here I want to say this that thing about giving people heads up about what they're going to face like that you or we lost a a kick 13 which is you know cryptologic device that you know that we use for radios it's a cryptological device that when you lose means the entire country of America has to update their cryptological modes which is a giant deal and so for Jocco to just give you the normal face on that it's actually the worst it's like your dad telling you he's he's uh he's not angry he's just disappointed I mean it's actually the worst because if you were like dude are you kidding me you know like I would look at it it would be desirable which I was like Roger and just looks back at you like it's like angry doesn't it give you like a you know you're gonna make whatever $5,000 this month you know what I know you like to get after it and go have a good time and you should and you should do that with $4,000 not with $4,999 so if you're in a position where you can help people plan their economic future please do that you know what it's funny that you're actually saying that because you of all the people I worked with in 13 years in the Navy like you're the only one that did that and maybe not on like a you didn't like have a presentation to the entire task unit you know maybe you could have done something absolutely should have no I maybe it's on the other side of like your brain or something but doesn't it give you like a big sense of comfort like okay at least this is manageable like it's a big deal but at least it's manageable because like if you're already kind of freaking out for whatever reason and you bring it to him who's like part of the reason you're kind of apprehensive about the whole thing to say the least and he doesn't freak out so it's like it feels like in your mind you're like but the fact that he's saying look you're not bringing people in there to preach on how to do things you're bringing in their educate to have discussions and he's got the whole topic of discussions here military courtesy personal standards military discipline promotions unit history a speed of core accomplishments missions troop information morale self education of officers professional publications responsibility for fun he's got everything security classification use a misuse of military vehicles so basically it's like tell the guys what's going on that's what he's saying you have to tell people what's going on and then he's got this commander's checklist for success and this we've already been going for a while so this will probably be the last thing we cover every commander at every echelon should maintain a continuing checklist to be left for or given to his successor to command this checklist should contain items of value that will assist the new commander in becoming familiar with his command more rapidly than if he had had to uncover the same items over a period of time such items must consist of one significant strengths and weaknesses of key officers and non-commission officers in the command boom isn't it weird that we might be in charge of people and know that we would have to turn this over and not keep track of like who's what strengthen weaknesses are next important policy matters announced by senior commanders and not contained in SOP or directives so you're tracking this stuff a good turnover is such an important thing to to do and what I think is important about a turnover it's great to have it to turn over to the next unit but what it does is it forces you to actually think through how you are operating and when you force yourself to think through how you're operating you define it you refine it you codify it right so he's out there I actually owe him copies of about face of this new version but guess what I'll some sending him a RCs of extreme ownership because they gave us about six each I have all of mine I have mine as well you want to know why why do you have yours why did you keep yours I think I some of my intended to send to people and they didn't get sent and some of my just thought be kind of cool to get hang on to you know I only kept I first of all I didn't know that it was a big deal I didn't know that this is this whole thing you know we didn't know if the hell we are doing when it came to writing so we didn't know if the hell we were doing so they send us these things and I'm like that's legit all right back to the book chart number four evidence of we're on this whole thing talking about morale and this is evidence of morale and discussing the subject of morale with visitors I often ask and am asked what do you look for in a unit or in order to gauge the morale since morale is influenced by so many factors there are naturally many indications of the state of morale the things I know quickly and sizing up a unit include I'm gonna burn through some of these saluting dress good house keeping pride pride I'll go into that one a little bit are the men eager to show their accomplishments do they point to their units history with pride do they have something good to sell and try and sell it participating in charities athletic program and support teams and athletic program enthusiastically supporters always a favorable indication of morale church attendance soldiers deposits and other savings a man who saves his money each month is banking on his future and his wellage it is usually a well adjusted and confident soldier when there are many such soldiers in a unit there is a depth of stability in the organization but commanders should not attempt to coerce the men to participate in this program you know just for for for all leaders really this is probably one of the things when I look back at my military career that I did a pretty horrible job of and that was that I never said all guys here's what you should do with your money here's some here's some moves to make you know here's some things that you should do here some things that you shouldn't do so just if you're a leader especially if you're a military leader look when you're a militant a lot of kids that joined the military myself included hey when I got to the teams and I was an E4 in the teams I was the richest person in the world and you know I got that paycheck every two weeks and you know it's funny people like say it to me like you're all in either one or two ways one is like you know I kind of like this sour apple sniper like they kind of ashamed to tell me and then the other ones like sour apple sniper is way better but it's we kind of like to think oh it's harder for me and without the recognition of like man this is it's hard for everybody and if I can push a little bit harder it's gonna give me the advantage I figured that out in hell week for me I wasn't the fastest runner I wasn't a fastest swimmer but like by like day two of hell week everyone is crushed I was like dude I'm good to go like all cool got it in a way I got it in a way being like overly tired driving could then again I don't know could be worse if it's because people were sick of the wheel because you can't control it you get the point where you can control it with like being drunk because it's you know it's facing sometimes when people are drunk behind the wheel they get like more daring and aggressive so they'll you know it's less that but that that's an awesome thing man and that's powerful I mean you and I were just talking about this today right with some some uh with Ashlong front stuff and and uh and our strategic growth and and things that I was really spinning up about and and really stressing on you're like it's not that big of a deal you know and that is that's something that is uh that perspective you know what someone's immersed it or it's someone is immersed in the details of things and they're like it's the way it's bearing down on them or like man this is gonna happen it's really easy to get stressed out about that hey you know whether even it's just something stupid like I'm thinking of some dump stuff like a you lost some gear right some let's say some critical gear which you did or your platoon did which means you did like like you know you come to me all right cool Roger you know as opposed to being like I can't believe you did that because now you can be like god jack was such a jerk and it's almost like you know we can have a little spatio as opposed to me just late just saddling you with unbearable guilt for letting me down but it's it's the reality is it's gets the problem fixed it gives the problem fixed I mean with it's not unbearable guilt it's like you're you're gonna like I would be I was feeling literally like physically claustrophobic because of how tired I was like empathetically getting from watching you guys and like how your arms were whatever else like man I don't know how he he can even take that or whatever I you know it's a learning process you know you learn about you know you learn about control in your emotions life I've learned a lot about parenting I feel like with the kids practicing or taking opportunities to practice normal face 100% of the time is a good method it's a good method and it is a great thing like no joke it is a great thing for a leader to be able to control your emotions because your emotions we already talked about this if I'm panicking if lay for a porch to me some news you know you're going to like if you I've had fighters where they're they got their first big they're on the big stage maybe they're in the UFC for the first time or whatever they get nervous and they don't know what that is no one ever told them hey man you're gonna feel you know you're gonna feel sick you're gonna feel butterflies T do or T is you know you know when you have a unit turning over thing like people coming in like get these idiots out of here we're going to take take over even though we've been there for six months learning and I was like man how are you going to learn from us to continue the mission to be more effective if we don't tell you what we screwed up but clearly he wasn't used to that and most people weren't doing that and I think that taking deeply about it and if you care about the mission then you want you want the people it is successful and and I actually you've got to kind of be honest with where if that's the goal like for real goal you know to work out every day that is a good thing as opposed to you know like I'm going to try to work out this week you know there's a difference is what I'm saying Dave we got got like going on with Ashland front work with leaders all the time you know as we talk about it just been phenomenal watch them particularly through this tough times of you know some some economic turmoil through COVID lockdowns and and unrest across riots across America etc like it's been it's been awesome to see companies taking apply those principles and so we've got got some great stuff going on Ashland front I think particularly if you think about decades from now what that might be like I a friend of mine showed me you know obviously that stuff becomes quite valuable to collectors and people that know you know it's meaningful to people that it has the understand the value of what it is and how rare it is and a friend of mine showed me a copy of it was a biography of Stonewall Jackson and he was like he handed it to me it was kind of his old and kind of brittle You know if I if I like I've got to pretend like I know it all and like no everyone knows you don't know at all.
