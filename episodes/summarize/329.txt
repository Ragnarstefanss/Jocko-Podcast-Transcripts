He knows exactly what you're getting into exactly And he gave you some good advice which we're gonna find out you did not listen to All right Uh boot camp here we were issued our new nice green uniforms and all the good stuff that comes with it underwear socks boots and blankets are new friends The drill sergeants marched us or at least we called it marching over to get our first army haircut It took about one minute, but it was free and you know what they say you get what you pay for I'd only been in the army a few days when our company was brought into one of our training buildings There was this big bad looking rainbow guy who was looking for volunteers for the green berets I didn't know a lot about the green berets, but I did know they were one of the most elite fighting units in the army This guy looked as though he could have kicked any 10 of us at once I thought if I'm going to war I want to go with the best so I raised my hand when he asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for the green berets Special forces I knew this would cost me another year of service But I figured another year is worth the price to pay to be among the army's best I guess those a poor listener when it came to my dad's advice about volunteer You know my thoughts were Okay, the good Lord is with me and with us and We're gonna be all right, but I got to do my day and whatever it takes, you know One of my biggest fears was what I freeze you know having never been in combat You know, I mean I've heard of guys that've been in combat before freezing Even guys that've been in for a long time You know, but that was a concern of mine what I'd be able to but all the old timers kept coming up to him and said don't hesitate Don't have a safety whatever you do it on hesitate was there anyone else that had no combat experience So there was four of us had never been in combat before hell and how many out of 56 four of us Never been in combat but I can tell you I am living proof that what they we trained on probably saved a bunch of lives You know and Awesome life lesson Going back to the book you said is one of the six guys assigned to guard the tactical operations And I started to see that I might miss out on some of the key training if I wanted to have a chance to get in selected for one of the assault force teams I had to train when I was not pulling guard duty Security was so tight that we didn't know who we would be rescuing or in what part of the world the mission would take place There was a lot of speculation that it might be an attempt to free prisoners in Cuba Based on the three hour flying time of the mission I had been training and pulling guard duty for about a month when I got my chance to speak up I was checking Colonel Bill's whole Simon's For access to the talk building while we were waiting for an escort to take the bull in He asked how things were going for me I knew that he was only going to pick some of us for the actual mission I think there was somewhere else you thought you might be going to replace hijacked on tarmacs around the Camorole that we thought we might be going into Rescue you know people on hijacked planes, so you have no idea what you're doing No, which and everybody you know it was we didn't know we just knew we were gonna do some type of rescue and We trained Fort and did you know that it was real? But like any kind of adventurous and this is brought just my experience like the bias I came from my experience with meeting all these guys We're gonna make a think doing all these Adventurous things, you know, where it's like you go through these crazy missions or all these crazy military experiences You come home and boom Let's switch missions into some other quote-unquote Adventurous scenario, you know and a lot of people a lot of us or not us, but a lot of people do that So like you don't have to you know not everyone's gonna come home and start a tactical shooting company You know like that's not That's not the normal thing what makes it seem normal is you know when someone owns a tactical shooting company that they were a veteran So you neutralize everybody on the way through and that was our orders and that's what we did and you know the Our way of clearing a building is quite different in the way they cleared a day We didn't worry about collateral damage, you know, you were the bad guy and that's what it was gonna be So we made sure that We neutralized and moved on to the next building Now, were you worried about where you're What did you guys plan in such a way that your bullets That were going through this building that there was no friendlies on the other side Did you guys have the whole thing kind of mapped out? and You know you learned You know all the basics of you know patroling things like that they went into a little more advanced, you know how to set up ambushes He always told us if you're gonna do anything Do your best correct That's an important one You go on to say here as the member as a member of the advanced party another one of our tasks was to build this large mock-up of buildings Using target canvas as the walls with doors with cutouts for windows we began constructing it on Thursday September 10th and it took us Several days to complete we didn't know why we were having to build it it wasn't until we did our first walk through during our initial training That I realized how it would be used Even then we had no idea it was a Dimensionally perfect replica of all the buildings and walls of the POW camp in saante North Vietnam Two by four is whatever jam two by four is near the dirt and then build little buildings Full size walk-throughs It looked like toilet paper on wrapped on a Two before so it reminded me you know, but and one of the things we finally clarified in and the book was Everybody said we used to take it down every night I'll put it in unedited into the book and I got about 40 of them and Some are one paragraph summer three or four five pages, you know, but it's their memorable moment on the raid Or about the rate or whatever might be and you know, it just gives a whole different perspective, you know from a P.O. W. standpoint to a guy flying at you know Mid midcap overs and it really It was empty At this time we started to move back to the LZ for extraction We still moved with these assumption that there could be more enemy soldiers lying in the bushes While the helicopters were and route were returning to extract us One of red wines rolls was to clear the planned LZ by cutting down certain light poles that task revealed one frustrating Surprise we had brought a chainsaw to cut down certain wooden telephone poles But sergeant first class Charles, Maston and sergeant first class Ronnie straight hand were to blow up a tall concrete light pole The moment that Maston and Strahan finished placing the four one pound packets of c4 explosive We're ready to blow and we're conforming confirming that they should activate the fuse apple one was arriving They waited until apple one had landed offloaded green leaf and departed Ensured of safety they detonated the c4 as the pole rose into the air a huge flash of light Maston and Strahan could See that this was not a light pole it had four large high tension power lines Dancing sparks were everywhere as the four huge power lines hit the rice patties the very rice patties And which our soldiers and POWs would be marching to load the returning chalpers We were going to have to find a new location where are we going to have to find a new location for the LZ Maston, Strahan and Captain Jim McClam as the marshalling area control officer immediately set about ensuring They understood the location of all the wines and whether they were hot After assessing the situation and ensuring there were no other potential hazards they began placing the bean bag lights in an area suitably distant from the power lines As everyone returned to the LZ waiting for the helicopters we had a few minutes to gather people and equipment to load on apple one and apple two You just not go into your life lessons in here Don't be a complainer the world is moving on and needs people to solve problems A value at your situation make a decision and execute any new plan without complaining and feels or for yourself Not gonna help Not gonna help the situation. yeah like dips you feel dips you feel good put but muscle ups too like when you get done with muscle ups You feel like kind of jacked all the way around Yeah, so you know when chasing gardeners at the other day that he takes a one Discipline go pill in the morning that's he I haven't tried it yet, but that seems like a good move Just to get a little a little kicker And you know That that probably Is one of the more Important messages that I think Could come out of this book because I think the training that we did saved our lives because we had I mean we had 177 rehearsals and Part of those were alternate you know like if red wine went down It was red wine alternate red wine greenly went down was alternate greenly right Um, took your first airplane ride after AIT you say I experienced my first airplane ride It took me from Fort Leonard wood to Fort Benning, Georgia Jump school as much as I expected a lot of running and push-ups and when you screwed up and morning inspections I went through jump school in August Fast forward a little bit here you said I had the good fortune going through jump school with some navy seals from team two if I recall correctly When they learned that I was headed for special forces training they decided they would adopt me into their ranks The water troughs we were we had were about a foot deep and 18 inches wide the seals stopped Up one of the troughs and filled it with water then about six of them grabbed me and dunked me in the water until I thought I was going to drown From then on they deemed me an honorary seal I guess you might say I had my first taste of water boat boarding They were actually great bunch of guys one day we were headed back to the barracks after a day training one of the seals was made to run around the platoon while we did the airborne shuffle But you know I went through basic seal training and there you get to eat and you get to eat Actually a lot most of the time you're getting three meals a day and usually one or two of them are in a Chow Hall where it's basically all you can eat and I always feel You know the Rangers that get one MRE day for whatever that is you know 85 days and you know you do things that You know I started driving a tractor I was six years old You know as you know was just I had to keep it between the bales
