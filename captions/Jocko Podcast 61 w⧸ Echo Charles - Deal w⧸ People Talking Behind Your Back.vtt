00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80
This is Jockel Podcast number 61 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:19.68
I go. Good evening. So it's been a few episodes since we got into the Q&A. So today

3
00:00:19.68 --> 00:00:24.88
we're going to go right into questions that come, they actually come from the interwebs.

4
00:00:24.88 --> 00:00:27.92
Sure. People out there. So everyone that gives questions,

5
00:00:27.92 --> 00:00:35.52
appreciate it. Thank you for the questions. I can't answer them all, but talking to some people out there,

6
00:00:37.36 --> 00:00:41.76
if you listen to the different questions, you can figure out your own answers to a lot of them.

7
00:00:41.76 --> 00:00:51.20
Yeah. You like learn the formulas and then you can apply. But thanks to the questions. I appreciate it.

8
00:00:51.20 --> 00:00:57.36
Sometimes when you, in my experience anyway, when I think, okay, I'm going to ask Jockel,

9
00:00:57.36 --> 00:01:02.000
this question and then you either write it out or even when I remember the other day when I

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.92
busted out questions and when I say them out loud, it was like a few weeks ago and I say it out loud,

11
00:01:08.48 --> 00:01:13.36
when I'm as I'm saying it to you, I'm like, oh, I know that. It's already because you think, you know,

12
00:01:13.36 --> 00:01:18.16
you realize. So you can kind of utilize that whole. So you've started to get the

13
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:22.96
formulas and your own head. And now as you're saying to me, say, oh, I know what that's. Yeah,

14
00:01:22.96 --> 00:01:29.92
exactly. How do I get out of bed in the morning? How do I be mentally tougher?

15
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:35.12
Be mentally tougher. All right, rock and roll. First question. Go.

16
00:01:36.40 --> 00:01:42.16
Jockel, hi, Jockel. Today I had what I believe you refer to as disciplinary breakdown.

17
00:01:43.20 --> 00:01:46.48
This morning, I found out that I had to take additional credits in college,

18
00:01:46.48 --> 00:01:52.000
and that I believe were completed. So he thought they were completely had to take more. That's

19
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.08
it turns out in a fit of rage. I took my phone and threw it across the room in frustration.

20
00:01:58.08 --> 00:02:03.68
I felt really good at it time, but five seconds later, I regretted because now broken phone.

21
00:02:05.52 --> 00:02:10.88
And I lost control of my emotions. So do you have any mental tricks or anything in general that

22
00:02:10.88 --> 00:02:17.28
you do when you're slightly irritated or outright furious? Yes, this used to happen a lot more.

23
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:20.48
I started to get soon, I haven't rolled for three weeks. Maybe I'm reading too much into it,

24
00:02:20.48 --> 00:02:26.40
but I felt great whenever I was rolling consistently. Maybe. And it don't, well, however,

25
00:02:27.44 --> 00:02:35.04
we do know that Jockel suits the soul. So, well, one of the things in me and you've

26
00:02:35.04 --> 00:02:42.96
talked about this too, when I realized that losing your temper was a sign of weakness.

27
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:48.56
As soon as I read, as soon as I made that connection, I said to myself, this is week,

28
00:02:48.56 --> 00:02:53.76
I'm going to try not to do it anymore. And what's weird is when you're a kid, I don't know if

29
00:02:53.76 --> 00:02:59.20
you remember this, but when I was a kid, and you'd see someone get angry and it made you afraid.

30
00:02:59.20 --> 00:03:08.08
And so, for a while, I saw it as like a power. You know, it's kind of a way to achieve power

31
00:03:08.64 --> 00:03:13.12
that you can lose your temper and then all of a sudden you have this extra strength. And so,

32
00:03:13.12 --> 00:03:18.32
when you're a little kid, and when I say a little kid, I mean, when I was 13, 14 years old,

33
00:03:18.32 --> 00:03:23.68
I thought, hey, if I go, if I could get that rage going and people are scared, like I used to feel,

34
00:03:23.68 --> 00:03:32.56
that's a positive thing. And then, like I said, as I got older, now you're talking 16, 15, 16, 17,

35
00:03:32.56 --> 00:03:40.000
I realize, hey, this isn't cool, this isn't strength, that's actually weakness. And when I

36
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.68
realized it was weakness, and I didn't realize that overnight, but I started getting the idea

37
00:03:46.40 --> 00:03:52.96
that that was weakness. And now, when you see someone that is in control, and even when bad things

38
00:03:52.96 --> 00:03:58.56
are happening, they're standing, stilically saying, okay, let me take another look at that,

39
00:03:58.56 --> 00:04:02.56
and I'll get it done. You know what I mean? They're just, okay, then you realize, okay, this guy is

40
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:11.52
really unflappable, which is a lot more impressive. So, again, you got to be able to detach from this,

41
00:04:11.52 --> 00:04:16.64
and, you know, I like to take pride in the fact that I'm going to keep my cool no matter what happens.

42
00:04:16.64 --> 00:04:20.48
And definitely, once I was in the one's year in the civil teams, you definitely want to be that

43
00:04:20.48 --> 00:04:24.72
guy that's keeping your keeping your cool no matter what's happening. Whether it's people are doing

44
00:04:24.72 --> 00:04:29.04
the wrong thing, or you just want to be the guy that's, hey, okay, come back over here, we need to

45
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:33.28
redo this. You just want to be that guy. That's way more impressive than the guy that says,

46
00:04:33.28 --> 00:04:38.64
okay, believe this. Don't be that person. So, and I've talked about this before, what are the

47
00:04:38.64 --> 00:04:47.04
pre-event indicators that show you or reveal to you that your temper is about to be lost? What

48
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:53.12
are they? Is it you, clinch your fists, right? Is it you raise your voice and you start doing that

49
00:04:53.12 --> 00:05:00.16
stuff? Do you start to have you breathing? Do you flare your nostrils right? Because that's an animal

50
00:05:00.16 --> 00:05:03.92
thing where you're going to take a more oxygen to open up the nostrils because you're about to get after it.

51
00:05:04.80 --> 00:05:10.64
Do you, you know, you're, does your, your head, you know, shaking or whatever, you're just like

52
00:05:10.64 --> 00:05:15.68
these things. So, what is it? What indicators do you have when you know that you're starting to feel

53
00:05:15.68 --> 00:05:21.68
that? And as soon as you feel that, you, you detach. You go, oh, that's what that is. That's an indicator

54
00:05:21.68 --> 00:05:28.48
and it's a weakness. And I don't like weakness. So, I'm not going to allow it. And then,

55
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:39.36
you know, take a breath. I like to, you know what, here's a good one. You want to, you want to

56
00:05:39.36 --> 00:05:49.68
get through that moment, nod your head slowly in the affirmative. Right? So, so when someone's telling

57
00:05:49.68 --> 00:05:55.92
me something that's making me mad, I'll just slowly nod my head. Like, I understand, this is the way

58
00:05:55.92 --> 00:06:05.36
things are. I accept this and this is, I'm calculating what my next move is going to be. And

59
00:06:05.36 --> 00:06:10.08
then you, you see, whatever, you know, guys will count to 10. You know, you tell your little kids that.

60
00:06:10.96 --> 00:06:14.16
Tell your little kids when they start losing their temper, you know, you need to count to 10.

61
00:06:14.16 --> 00:06:20.24
Count to 10, count to 100, count to 1000, whatever did you got to do. And get control because,

62
00:06:20.80 --> 00:06:24.72
like I said, if you're losing control, it's not starting to weakness. Yeah.

63
00:06:25.84 --> 00:06:32.48
Is, um, I said this before, where I read this book called mind game, small little book.

64
00:06:32.48 --> 00:06:39.20
Talk about anger management, like if people have anger issues, yeah, you realized it was low,

65
00:06:39.20 --> 00:06:43.28
or they said it was low self-esteem. They say, yeah, anger issues stem from low self-esteem.

66
00:06:43.28 --> 00:06:46.96
And that was really embarrassing, you know, I didn't have anger issues, but I'm saying,

67
00:06:46.96 --> 00:06:51.20
if someone ever told me like, oh, you have low self-esteem or something like that,

68
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.80
that would be pretty embarrassing. I always thought. And so to me, I took that as an extreme,

69
00:06:58.80 --> 00:07:03.12
being so sensitive to the, even the expression low self-esteem, that was like, oh, I can never

70
00:07:03.12 --> 00:07:09.52
get angry again. It says right there, everyone gets angry, you know. So that was always on my mind.

71
00:07:09.52 --> 00:07:13.92
Anytime I started to feel mad, I was like, okay, I feel mad right now, but I don't want to

72
00:07:13.92 --> 00:07:18.000
have low self-esteem. So I better act right, you know, kind of thing. And then after

73
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.40
while, just became a bit chill. But the, you know, say like there's a difference between how you

74
00:07:24.40 --> 00:07:29.20
feel and how you behave, like you fit your feelings, you know, but then you're not.

75
00:07:33.20 --> 00:07:37.04
So you know, you're mad, yeah, these mad feelings. So what are you going to go and

76
00:07:37.04 --> 00:07:42.000
straight up behave mad, you know, then yeah, and a lot of people do it. And a lot of people

77
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.84
actually behave mad and justify it because that's my true feelings. But again, they're two

78
00:07:47.84 --> 00:07:54.88
different things, man. Don't act at your true feelings in front of everybody. Most of the

79
00:07:54.88 --> 00:08:01.28
times that's not good. No, not good. Not good. Yeah, the, I dig it though, like, you know,

80
00:08:01.28 --> 00:08:04.96
because you know that feeling because if you actually are true feelings, by the way, the reason I'm

81
00:08:04.96 --> 00:08:09.36
saying that is if you act on your true feelings all the time, you won't get the long term

82
00:08:09.36 --> 00:08:14.72
place where you want to be. Oh, yeah, true feelings do not lead you to your true destination.

83
00:08:14.72 --> 00:08:20.72
Yeah, right. They don't. So don't actually, what you're going to keep your true feelings

84
00:08:20.72 --> 00:08:24.16
focused on the true destination that you want to be at and the true feelings that you have of the

85
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:27.44
anger and frustration and want to yell at somebody and all that other stupid stuff. You know what

86
00:08:27.44 --> 00:08:31.44
you end up with a broken iPhone because you hucked at the end of that. That's what you end up with.

87
00:08:31.44 --> 00:08:38.16
Real, how's this? Story time. I'll make it. Okay. So what am I doing for it? It's

88
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:45.36
working a long time ago. Um, name's Chris. So it's driving gets cut off or something, you know,

89
00:08:45.92 --> 00:08:51.76
rotary situation. True feelings, right? True feelings. Oh, that guy. I want to beat him up.

90
00:08:52.88 --> 00:09:00.32
I want to hurt him. Road raging. Y'all something or whatever. Maybe the other guy yelled at him first.

91
00:09:00.32 --> 00:09:04.88
I don't know how who started what, but they pull over, get into a fight. That's kind of in a way

92
00:09:04.88 --> 00:09:10.32
at the time that feels like the fantasy right there. We should fight this guy. I hope I the store.

93
00:09:10.32 --> 00:09:13.76
I'm going to I hope he's right there so I can fight him. I don't know whatever. That's a fantasy. That's

94
00:09:13.76 --> 00:09:19.36
your feelings. So anyway, Chris gets in a fight with this guy on the side of the road, grown

95
00:09:19.36 --> 00:09:25.84
adult by the way. Fight to the guy. Terrors his pack. Terrors in. Chris tears his own pack. Yes,

96
00:09:25.84 --> 00:09:30.000
in the fight. I don't know if he won or lost. Whatever. But he's coming off. I'm going to go into

97
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.16
the store. It's a six month injury. The surgery. Yeah, it did. Can you work with the

98
00:09:38.16 --> 00:09:42.96
torn pack? Almost this time, probably not. And all because the guy cut you off or wasn't

99
00:09:42.96 --> 00:09:48.16
mine fast enough for it was going, you know, two, whatever. It's one of those things. That's

100
00:09:48.16 --> 00:09:52.88
what your true feelings get you. Especially in the moment, especially when it's anger. Yeah,

101
00:09:52.88 --> 00:09:56.40
no. That's weird. We'll have to explore that at some point. Because I know it doesn't make

102
00:09:56.40 --> 00:10:00.48
sense. I'm not sitting here saying everyone suppress all your feelings. Yeah, all your real

103
00:10:00.48 --> 00:10:06.80
feeling. Yeah, but the stupid feelings that you have, suppress those, let them let them manifest

104
00:10:06.80 --> 00:10:12.40
themselves over time for a long term result. That's going to be what you actually want

105
00:10:12.40 --> 00:10:18.32
in life. Usually the anger. Yeah, anger for sure is wonderful. But anger, jealousy,

106
00:10:19.52 --> 00:10:24.48
ego, all those things. Those are all things that if you just act on them all the time,

107
00:10:24.48 --> 00:10:30.24
yeah, you're not going to have good times in life. I'm here to tell you. And every single feeling

108
00:10:30.24 --> 00:10:34.88
one, your drunk. Next, those are not good. Yeah, don't act on those either.

109
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.92
That's right. I let a session based on the book Extreme Ownership to my team at work.

110
00:10:42.72 --> 00:10:47.52
I'm not the leader, but everyone, including our manager was very supportive and enjoyed the session.

111
00:10:47.52 --> 00:10:52.16
The challenge from a team member was, is there such thing as taking too much ownership?

112
00:10:52.16 --> 00:10:58.96
But won't you start feeling guilty about not succeeding completely? This guilt would not be a good thing.

113
00:11:00.64 --> 00:11:05.84
Thoughts on handling this. Well, there's definitely a thing of, you can definitely take too much

114
00:11:05.84 --> 00:11:09.92
ownership, but that not for that reason. I've talked about this before. If you're taking too

115
00:11:09.92 --> 00:11:14.88
if you and I are on a team and I'm a leader and we've got a mission and I take so much ownership

116
00:11:14.88 --> 00:11:17.92
that I take, okay, echo, this is how we're going to do everything. You're going to listen to me,

117
00:11:17.92 --> 00:11:22.24
I own this and I don't give you any ownership. Now it's not your plan. And so now you don't execute it

118
00:11:22.24 --> 00:11:26.32
the best way and you don't buy into it and all that stuff. So that is how you take too much ownership.

119
00:11:26.32 --> 00:11:30.96
Takes away the, if you take too much ownership as a leader, you take away ownership from your

120
00:11:30.96 --> 00:11:38.80
subordinates and so you've taken. And again, it's, that's over ownership. If I take over ownership. Now,

121
00:11:38.80 --> 00:11:43.44
if I give you the mission and you go out and execute it and you mess it up and I say, okay,

122
00:11:43.44 --> 00:11:46.16
echo, I didn't give you enough guidance. I didn't give you the support. I didn't give you the training.

123
00:11:46.16 --> 00:11:52.000
I'm going to own the mistakes. I'm going to own the failure, overtly, but covertly, if I'm

124
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.28
giving you the mission, I'm going to say, hey, you take it and run with it. So that's where you need

125
00:11:55.28 --> 00:12:03.68
to be careful that. But guilt for failing is not a valid cause not to take ownership, right?

126
00:12:03.68 --> 00:12:10.16
You guess what? When you fail something, yeah, you're going to feel guilty, but it's a different

127
00:12:10.16 --> 00:12:16.08
kind of, you have to move a disappointment because things didn't go your way. And I'll tell you

128
00:12:16.08 --> 00:12:24.64
when you feel guilty, when you feel guilty, to me is if I know haven't done my best. I know I cut corners.

129
00:12:24.64 --> 00:12:31.36
I know I didn't invest the time. I know I, you know, didn't give it everything I could as a leader.

130
00:12:31.36 --> 00:12:35.68
That's when I feel guilty. If I give it everything and I've done everything I can and I look back

131
00:12:35.68 --> 00:12:39.60
and of course, there's going to be things that you didn't predict, right? Hindsight's 2020. We all know

132
00:12:39.60 --> 00:12:44.000
that, there's going to be things where you look back and you say, I wish I would have made a different

133
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
decision. But you have to, you have to say, okay, so what are you going to do in the future?

134
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.32
Be indecisive now? Are you not going to make decisions? Even at that moment when I made the decision,

135
00:12:52.32 --> 00:12:57.12
which, which was wrong now that we can see hindsight? Well, what were you going to do? You're going

136
00:12:57.12 --> 00:13:01.28
to wait and sit around and do nothing. And now we get attacked. We get maneuvered on. We get the

137
00:13:01.28 --> 00:13:08.16
competitor moves or the enemy moves on. So you might feel disappointed that you made the wrong decision.

138
00:13:08.16 --> 00:13:17.44
You might feel that type of guilt. But the real guilt for me is if I didn't give everything I could

139
00:13:17.44 --> 00:13:22.88
to the situation. So that's what causes guilt to me. Now the failure,

140
00:13:25.20 --> 00:13:31.52
an actual failure, it shouldn't cause that level of guilt. It should cause you to dig deep and figure

141
00:13:31.52 --> 00:13:34.56
out what happened and want to reattach it. That's what it should do. It should cause you

142
00:13:34.56 --> 00:13:42.000
to want to figure out where you failed, where your team failed and what you can do to ensure that

143
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.64
never happens again. If you want to call that guilt, you can call it guilt. But that is not a reason

144
00:13:46.64 --> 00:13:52.32
not to take ownership. You know, I might call it disappointment. It's a what I'll call it. I'll call

145
00:13:52.32 --> 00:13:57.28
it motivation. You know, and you know, I don't throw that work around easily. But if I fail

146
00:13:57.28 --> 00:14:01.36
at something, I'm going to be motivated to make sure I get it back on back in line and get that

147
00:14:01.36 --> 00:14:10.64
thing squared away. So take ownership. If you know take ownership, get things done right.

148
00:14:11.92 --> 00:14:20.48
And if you fail, don't feel guilty. Don't get guilty. Get aggressive. Find the problems and get

149
00:14:20.48 --> 00:14:25.92
himself. That's it. Reattach. Yeah, man. Makes sense. Yes, the guilt is what kind of like

150
00:14:25.92 --> 00:14:30.000
dang. It's all my fault. Like knowing, you know, taking ownership. Yeah, but it's like,

151
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.64
dang, it's all my fault. This failure. Look at everyone's, I don't know. Guy lost his commission

152
00:14:34.64 --> 00:14:42.08
or on that. Right. Dang. That kind of guilt. Dang. Yeah. And you know, I say this with businesses,

153
00:14:42.08 --> 00:14:45.28
they're, you know, like you just said, you make someone lose their commission because you couldn't

154
00:14:45.28 --> 00:14:48.48
get the deal done fast enough. You couldn't give the guy the support that they needed. Now they lose

155
00:14:48.48 --> 00:14:55.12
commission. You can be sure. You can feel guilty about that. Is that a reason not to take ownership

156
00:14:55.12 --> 00:15:00.32
of it? Absolutely not. It's a reason to take more ownership of it. And be like, okay, buddy,

157
00:15:00.32 --> 00:15:04.32
echo. I know you lost commission on that. Here's what I think I let you down. Here's when you

158
00:15:04.32 --> 00:15:08.32
need to communicate better. Here's what I need to prepare and be ready to support you next time.

159
00:15:08.32 --> 00:15:12.32
So this doesn't happen again. Are you with me, right? As opposed to saying,

160
00:15:13.68 --> 00:15:17.60
not taking ownership and saying, well, you know, echo, that was kind of, you know, those deals don't

161
00:15:17.60 --> 00:15:22.08
always work out. Maybe you should prepare better. Does that make me feel good as a leader?

162
00:15:22.08 --> 00:15:28.72
Wow, makes me feel like an idiot. It's kind of like the swamps of sadness.

163
00:15:29.28 --> 00:15:35.12
So the swamps of sadness is like, don't be him. When you get, don't want to visit it. It's from

164
00:15:35.12 --> 00:15:41.20
the neverending story. When it's basically you go through these swamps and it's super hard. No,

165
00:15:41.20 --> 00:15:47.60
but it makes sense. It's a metaphor for life. Okay. These swamps of movie. It's a movie. It's okay. It's a

166
00:15:47.60 --> 00:15:53.04
classic. Neverending story. Yeah, the neverending story. Anyway, the swamps of sadness are hard to walk

167
00:15:53.04 --> 00:15:57.44
through them. It's like it's hard. It's a swamp. Quick sand everywhere. Quick swamp, whatever. You

168
00:15:57.44 --> 00:16:02.88
know, it's not actually sand. But so you sink. And the more you sink the satter, you get the

169
00:16:02.88 --> 00:16:07.20
satter, you get them where you sink. So you got to like, you know, how you say, oh, like, if someone's

170
00:16:07.20 --> 00:16:11.36
feeling guilty in this case, or if you get sad, a lot of times you get sad and you're like,

171
00:16:11.36 --> 00:16:15.76
oh, I'm such a sad. It's the downward spiral. The downward spiral. Exactly. So you got to fight

172
00:16:15.76 --> 00:16:20.000
the sand. You got to fight the swamps of sadness and get aggressive and work. It's not easy.

173
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.76
Totally not easy. That's what the why it's a swamp. How do they cover the fact that if you're

174
00:16:23.76 --> 00:16:28.80
in the swamp and you're sinking, if you panic, you'll also sink more. Oh, yeah. Then you're getting

175
00:16:28.80 --> 00:16:32.48
aggressive because getting aggressive might just be like thrashing around. Now you're running out of

176
00:16:32.48 --> 00:16:36.48
breath as you're sinking. Yeah, and they cover that. No, they don't cover that part. That on the

177
00:16:36.48 --> 00:16:45.04
metaphor. No, no, no, no. We rethink the swamps of sadness. No, no, well, I don't think that that

178
00:16:45.04 --> 00:16:50.48
is for real in the water. You know, when you're in the water, it's something starts going wrong.

179
00:16:51.20 --> 00:16:56.16
If you get panicky, your breath is going faster. Your oxygen is going quicker. You're going to die.

180
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:04.000
You have to relax. You have to learn relax. You got to relax. Yeah. And just switching to problems

181
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.80
all being moved. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. But it is true that you can go in the downward spiral.

182
00:17:10.80 --> 00:17:18.24
And, you know, we see that in people's lives, right? People's lives. They mess. They lose their job.

183
00:17:19.28 --> 00:17:23.04
And instead of going cool opportunity, somebody's heavy up on social media today,

184
00:17:23.04 --> 00:17:27.28
they're like, lost my job. Good. I got an opportunity to go out and find another job. I'm going

185
00:17:27.28 --> 00:17:34.08
to step up. Like, that's what you do. Yeah. Yeah. And as opposed to, lost my job. Oh, no,

186
00:17:34.08 --> 00:17:37.52
whatever they do. And now you start going down the downward spiral because now you can't pay

187
00:17:37.52 --> 00:17:42.16
you rent. Next thing, you know, you're losing your your apartment. Yeah. And now you can't pay your car

188
00:17:42.16 --> 00:17:46.64
payment either. And now you're losing your car. Yeah. So what do we do? How does that help?

189
00:17:47.44 --> 00:17:52.48
Doesn't help. Don't panic. Get aggressive. Figure out what you're going to do next. Take advantage

190
00:17:52.48 --> 00:17:59.04
of the situation. Yeah. Okay. Let's get it. Next question. Next question.

191
00:18:01.04 --> 00:18:05.60
Can you talk about the experience of rolling with Hickson? Oh, you should just call him

192
00:18:05.60 --> 00:18:13.04
press where you. I answered this on Twitter. Someone said, how impressed were you? I responded all caps

193
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:26.96
impressed. So, due to, I was, this is back in, this is, well, it's back in the dirt. So it's back in the day.

194
00:18:26.96 --> 00:18:36.72
And I was at team one at the time. And so I think we're talking 95, 96 maybe. Maybe even, yeah,

195
00:18:36.72 --> 00:18:43.60
95, 96, maybe 97. I think it was 97. And I was, yeah, it was 97 because I was working in the training

196
00:18:43.60 --> 00:18:52.64
department. And I was into GJ2 for us, I was a blue belt. And I wanted to go and train with Hickson.

197
00:18:52.64 --> 00:18:56.000
Right. Because if you don't know anything about Hickson for those people that aren't GJ2 players,

198
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:10.08
Hickson is the, he's considered to be the best ever at GJ2. And above and beyond just being the best

199
00:19:10.08 --> 00:19:17.92
ever, Hickson Gracie, being considered the best ever at the sport, he has a high level of

200
00:19:17.92 --> 00:19:27.20
mistake about him. And, you know, there's a bunch of reasons for that, Misty. And there's a great story.

201
00:19:27.20 --> 00:19:33.12
And, you know, where, I don't, you know the story when the guy from Japan challenged him? Yes.

202
00:19:33.12 --> 00:19:38.32
Yeah. So, guy from Japan, he beat one guy in Japan and his teammate said, I will fight you at any

203
00:19:38.32 --> 00:19:45.60
time. The guy came to Hickson's academy and challenged him to a fight. And Hickson wasn't there at the

204
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:49.04
time. They called Hickson and said, Hey, this guy from Japan's here to challenge your honor.

205
00:19:49.04 --> 00:19:54.24
Hickson's like, Oh, he'll be there in 15 minutes. So Hickson came down. They wanted to record it.

206
00:19:54.24 --> 00:20:00.56
And he said, No, you can't, he goes, I will record it. I will own the video. And we will fight now.

207
00:20:00.56 --> 00:20:06.64
And Hickson annihilated him. And that's one of the mistakes where it's actually the guy came back

208
00:20:06.64 --> 00:20:10.80
a little while later and brought him a show gun helmet and a samurai sword or something like that.

209
00:20:10.80 --> 00:20:14.64
I think there's some drama before that though. I think the guy went back and was like, yeah,

210
00:20:14.64 --> 00:20:21.04
him and like a bunch of people beat me or a bunch of people beat me up and they reported it and then

211
00:20:21.04 --> 00:20:26.32
some high, I forget the details, but somehow he was persuaded to just tell the truth.

212
00:20:26.32 --> 00:20:30.24
Yeah. Well, they had a video of it. Hickson actually had a video of it.

213
00:20:30.24 --> 00:20:37.36
Video exists. Yeah. So, the guy told the truth. And then it was cool. And the other thing that's crazy.

214
00:20:37.36 --> 00:20:43.44
Well, the other thing that adds to the mistake of Hickson is that everybody that rolls with them,

215
00:20:43.44 --> 00:20:49.20
every multiple time, you know, five times, six times, seven times, world champion,

216
00:20:49.20 --> 00:20:55.44
G.J. 2 person rolls with them and they say, I was helpless. The guys that are

217
00:20:55.44 --> 00:21:03.36
winning dominating the world championships or saying, you know, he, I was helpless and he's above

218
00:21:03.36 --> 00:21:08.24
and beyond anybody else that I've ever rolled with. So, in, you know, Hickson's now probably

219
00:21:08.24 --> 00:21:16.32
50s something and he's not like rolling with the competitive black belts anymore, but this is,

220
00:21:16.32 --> 00:21:20.72
you know, five years, no, maybe 10 years ago. He was, he was doing that. And he wouldn't compete,

221
00:21:20.72 --> 00:21:25.04
but the guys would come to train with him and he destroy him. And there's some great stories online

222
00:21:25.04 --> 00:21:30.40
that a bunch of really good black belts have said, I mean, really good black belts have said,

223
00:21:30.40 --> 00:21:35.84
you know, I was rolling with Hickson and he just annihilated me. So, this is for me,

224
00:21:35.84 --> 00:21:40.40
you know, I was a boob. But I was a pretty good boob out. You know, you're a Dave for back in the day.

225
00:21:40.96 --> 00:21:45.92
And this is the beautiful thing, you know, I was at, I was at SILT 1. And so, there's something

226
00:21:45.92 --> 00:21:50.40
to military. You can get no cost orders, meaning, hey, you don't have to take leave, but we'll

227
00:21:50.40 --> 00:21:54.80
give you orders to go somewhere. And we're not going to pay for it, because, you know, we don't,

228
00:21:54.80 --> 00:21:57.84
we're not going to waste government money or spend government money on what you want to do,

229
00:21:57.84 --> 00:22:02.48
but we'll let you go do it. So, I got no cost orders, basically SILT 1 said, hey, you can go up and train.

230
00:22:02.48 --> 00:22:11.12
And so, I did that. This is at the old Pico Street Academy, Burr. And it was, the Pico Street Academy was kind

231
00:22:11.12 --> 00:22:20.96
of a, it was like a dance studio or something, where they would lay down mats. And I went up there.

232
00:22:20.96 --> 00:22:24.80
I think I would think I ended up staying up there for nine days, I stayed at some crappy hotel,

233
00:22:24.80 --> 00:22:32.80
around the corner. And when I got there, like Hicks and wasn't teaching, so I go there and I, you know,

234
00:22:32.80 --> 00:22:37.84
hey, I want to train. And the guy that was there, Limol, who's, you know, that is right. Yeah,

235
00:22:38.40 --> 00:22:45.12
Luis, was a heras, head as, what's his last name? Oh, and I just know, it's Limol. It's Limol. Right.

236
00:22:45.12 --> 00:22:49.68
So, Limol, awesome. Judicial guy, awesome black belt, you know, Hicks and Gracie black belt.

237
00:22:49.68 --> 00:22:52.80
And so, he's teaching and he's, you know, and I was coming from Fabio Santos,

238
00:22:52.80 --> 00:22:59.04
who's another Hicks and black belt. And, you know, my original instructor in Gigiitsu,

239
00:22:59.04 --> 00:23:03.44
where, you know, he made all kinds of incredible Gigiitsu guys, Fabio did, you know, you got,

240
00:23:03.44 --> 00:23:10.000
it just all kinds, Greg Train, Dean, Higgs, James, Craig Call, I mean, all kinds are really good.

241
00:23:10.56 --> 00:23:15.52
High level guys coming out of Fabio. And then there's a hole. There's like another generation of

242
00:23:15.52 --> 00:23:19.92
black belts that came out of Fabio too. Who are all awesome guy, Tino, and just a bunch of,

243
00:23:19.92 --> 00:23:27.20
really good guy, Eric. Anyways, Limol was another Hicks and black belt, and he was sort of the instructor

244
00:23:27.20 --> 00:23:32.56
at the school. So, I get up there and I'm taking the classes and he teaches two classes a day or maybe

245
00:23:32.56 --> 00:23:35.84
three classes a day. So, I'm just taking three classes a day while he's teaching, you know,

246
00:23:35.84 --> 00:23:38.96
one's in the day and he has one in the afternoon, he has one at night and I'm taking all the

247
00:23:38.96 --> 00:23:43.84
classes and I'm learning, you know, his style. And at this time, honestly, the styles weren't,

248
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:47.84
if you go to a different school now, you can, there's a little bit more variance in styles

249
00:23:47.84 --> 00:23:52.48
between schools. At this time, man, it was all closer to the source. Right. So, all the styles weren't.

250
00:23:52.48 --> 00:23:58.000
So, it was closer to now, now we're actually getting beyond that because now with YouTube and everything

251
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.12
and everyone competing so much all the time, there's a much quicker transfer of energy, but five

252
00:24:03.12 --> 00:24:08.08
years ago, eight years ago, when you went to a different school, there was a much different style.

253
00:24:08.08 --> 00:24:16.24
But at this time, 20 years ago, there was, there was, you know, it all came from the same source,

254
00:24:16.24 --> 00:24:22.56
yes. So, it was much more similar. So, I'm going to these classes two, three times a day and

255
00:24:23.68 --> 00:24:28.64
there's 10, 15 people, you know, and they're good, you know, we're all probably about the same,

256
00:24:28.64 --> 00:24:32.24
you know, he might have been a purple belt or two and Lamaun was awesome, super cool guy,

257
00:24:32.24 --> 00:24:37.04
real casual guy. And so, that's what the classes were like, super casual. We'd lay out the mats on the

258
00:24:37.04 --> 00:24:41.52
wooden floor and the dance studio and then we'd, we'd train and shoot the breeze, kind of like

259
00:24:41.52 --> 00:24:46.000
a Jiu-Jitsu class, just laid back, a little stretch, maybe learn to move or two, had some rolls,

260
00:24:46.88 --> 00:24:52.40
a little bit more relaxed, Fabio, Fabio Santos runs of the Esmore Old School and more regimented,

261
00:24:52.40 --> 00:24:56.24
you know, Fabio, you're like, gonna get in there, you're gonna do your warm-up and then you're

262
00:24:56.24 --> 00:25:00.88
gonna learn some moves and then you're gonna train. Lamaun was a little bit more laid back,

263
00:25:00.88 --> 00:25:06.72
cool chill, teaching really good stuff. So, that's Monday and then Tuesday and then Wednesday and then

264
00:25:06.72 --> 00:25:12.72
and then Lamaun, you know, in the afternoon or in the evening on Wednesday or I think it was

265
00:25:12.72 --> 00:25:16.24
a free-with-day, what was like Wednesday or Thursday, I think it was Wednesday, he's like,

266
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:22.56
hey, Hicksson's gonna teach tomorrow night and I'll just go off. So, so, I come in Thursday night,

267
00:25:23.84 --> 00:25:33.60
I'm pulling up in my 1991 ever, like Dodge Caravan pull up and many van man and

268
00:25:33.60 --> 00:25:43.44
there's that car, there's more cars, nothing, so now I walk in and it's, there's people everywhere,

269
00:25:43.44 --> 00:25:48.96
right, it's crowded, it's crowded, it went from like 10 or 12 people in the class, now we,

270
00:25:50.16 --> 00:25:55.28
there's like a hundred people there, I'm serious, we had to lay out like all these different mats

271
00:25:55.28 --> 00:26:06.80
and everyone is quiet, no one's talking, it was, I was too old, so Hicksson's there,

272
00:26:06.80 --> 00:26:14.16
and he's, you know, like, in a corner, you know, just cool chill and he looks at Lamaun and he,

273
00:26:14.16 --> 00:26:19.04
you know, gives him like a head nod in the months, okay, we're warming up and I was like, okay,

274
00:26:19.04 --> 00:26:23.76
so everyone gets in the line, they start doing the old school, due to we're running in a circle,

275
00:26:23.76 --> 00:26:30.80
silence, like no one's saying anything, it's just silence, and so you could feel the presence of

276
00:26:30.80 --> 00:26:36.48
Hicks and there's a hundred people now and there's just ten times as many people and everyone's

277
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:44.16
quiet, everyone's serious and then, you know, we get done with like a 20 minute warm-up of stretchy

278
00:26:44.16 --> 00:26:51.12
and exercise, this is just getting after it and then he gets done, he gets to solve a circle and

279
00:26:51.12 --> 00:26:58.56
the circle's huge and then, you know, Hicksson, like, walks out into the middle of the mat and then

280
00:26:59.76 --> 00:27:06.48
he sits in the center and you can hear a bend-drop, there was that, there was that awesome and then he

281
00:27:06.48 --> 00:27:15.28
taught class, he taught class and I took notes and maybe at some point we can go through all those

282
00:27:15.28 --> 00:27:23.68
notes that I took but there's one of the most important lessons that I learned about jujitsu as a

283
00:27:23.68 --> 00:27:33.92
whole, I learned that during that time and I actually the way Hicks and told it, I've translated

284
00:27:33.92 --> 00:27:43.12
into my own way of saying it, but believe me it's close, like, it what it was, what it is, is this,

285
00:27:43.12 --> 00:27:51.84
okay and you've probably heard me, I teach this to this day is if you're playing basketball or

286
00:27:51.84 --> 00:27:58.48
you're playing soccer, I think soccer is what Hicks and used as the example, if we're playing soccer

287
00:27:59.84 --> 00:28:07.28
and I want to, or for playing football, because you played football, if I faint to the left, right,

288
00:28:07.28 --> 00:28:14.88
you as a defender, you have to react to me, if you don't move to the left, I'm just going to go

289
00:28:14.88 --> 00:28:21.84
left and you're going to be lost. So when I faked to the left and now you move, I can quickly

290
00:28:21.84 --> 00:28:26.64
adjust back because I'm one step ahead of you, it was a fake, it wasn't a full commitment so

291
00:28:26.64 --> 00:28:32.88
I can get by you because when you put, when you move your weight, your weight is a real thing

292
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:36.64
and you have to place it into the ground and when you put your weight into the ground, it takes a quarter

293
00:28:36.64 --> 00:28:41.04
of a second to pull that weight back off the ground and put it in the other direction. So the

294
00:28:41.04 --> 00:28:49.76
difference between jujitsu, the guy on the bottom, when you fake me, I don't have to put my weight

295
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:57.04
anywhere. My weight does not have to follow you if you're on the bottom and the guy on the bottom

296
00:28:57.04 --> 00:29:02.56
in jujitsu, if you if you suck and jive, my weight, I don't have to plant my weight, that's what's

297
00:29:02.56 --> 00:29:06.64
really hard to like faint one way and then run the other way, it doesn't really work and you can

298
00:29:06.64 --> 00:29:15.04
you do it, but it doesn't work consistently in jujitsu and so that was this huge lesson to me that

299
00:29:15.04 --> 00:29:22.64
I've always remembered and what and the other part of it is was the hip movement and how to move

300
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:28.72
your hips on the bottom and if you don't move your hips on the bottom, you're going to get your

301
00:29:28.72 --> 00:29:35.36
guard past and if you don't control the hips when you're passing, then you won't be able to pass

302
00:29:35.36 --> 00:29:41.12
the guard. So I have a real, I had a real focus for a long time of how to keep my hips mobile

303
00:29:41.12 --> 00:29:46.000
on the ground so that people couldn't pass my guard and it's something that I still concentrate on

304
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:51.28
and when you're passing the guard, if you and again this is another thing you might hear me tell

305
00:29:51.28 --> 00:29:56.88
people like, oh you got control my legs, cool you didn't control my hips and you can control my legs,

306
00:29:56.88 --> 00:30:00.40
you can put pin them on the ground, I can still move my hips eventually, it'll be a little bit more

307
00:30:00.40 --> 00:30:09.20
tricky but I can do it. So those were those two points that I learned from Hixon, I

308
00:30:11.20 --> 00:30:18.64
I really focused on them for a long period of time and so that was awesome and then of course

309
00:30:18.64 --> 00:30:22.08
I rolled with Hixon because I was friends with Fabio and Fabio told him I was going to be there and so

310
00:30:22.08 --> 00:30:32.88
he was a great guy and rolled with me and like I said I was a blue belt and I was a good blue belt,

311
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:39.28
right meaning when I rolled with, when I rolled with brown belts and black belts which there weren't

312
00:30:39.28 --> 00:30:45.20
a lot of at the time, I did really good you know I mean we were all competitive at Fabio

313
00:30:45.20 --> 00:30:50.24
school at that time you know us guys that were really hard cork as Dean at this time was he might have

314
00:30:50.24 --> 00:30:54.72
been a blue belt or a purple belt but we were the guys, Higgs was a purple belt at the time so

315
00:30:54.72 --> 00:31:00.72
we were the guys and you know when guys would come from Brazil off the competition circuit

316
00:31:00.72 --> 00:31:05.36
to come and train at Fabio's when they'd stop by you know those guys would have a brown belt

317
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:10.08
black belts are going against Dean Lister and Higgs I mean those guys were not getting

318
00:31:10.08 --> 00:31:18.16
and it was you know Dean and Higgs were awesome Dean was phenomenal, Higgs was phenomenal and I was

319
00:31:18.16 --> 00:31:22.80
in the mix with those guys you know so we were good is what I'm saying so what didn't feel like

320
00:31:22.80 --> 00:31:28.32
to roll with Hixon I thought about this and I thought about a way to describe it and this is the way

321
00:31:28.32 --> 00:31:36.16
I am going to describe it it's going to be hard to imagine but try and imagine it okay if you ever felt

322
00:31:36.16 --> 00:31:43.52
very quick a large amount of very quickly rolling water or flowing water yeah so a river

323
00:31:44.48 --> 00:31:50.80
a giant hose a pipe with water like coming out of it and when you stick your hand like you can't

324
00:31:50.80 --> 00:32:00.32
barely resist it that much water so imagine that feeling of force but it's not going fast it's going slow

325
00:32:00.32 --> 00:32:07.84
it just it don't you can't stop it and wherever you but just like water so it's like that much

326
00:32:07.84 --> 00:32:14.08
force but just like water wherever you go to stop it it just goes around it and it was that's that was

327
00:32:14.08 --> 00:32:22.24
what what it was like and really really just phenomenal due to it I mean even at that time

328
00:32:22.24 --> 00:32:29.12
and remembering back to it it was another level of due to for sure that was was awesome

329
00:32:29.12 --> 00:32:34.56
now sorry yeah that's that's rolling of Hixon I still actually I got some mutual friends with Hixon

330
00:32:34.56 --> 00:32:44.48
and I see him occasionally and you know the the cool thing about Hixon is

331
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.60
he's got a personality that

332
00:32:51.60 --> 00:33:01.04
I would love to tell you that he's you know like a stereotypical

333
00:33:01.92 --> 00:33:09.44
peaceful warrior master that scenes content with where he's ended up in life and with his experiences

334
00:33:09.44 --> 00:33:23.76
in life but with Hixon I get the feeling that he's a guy that fighting is in his blood right

335
00:33:23.76 --> 00:33:30.72
and even though he's a mellow guy and he has nothing to prove to anybody I think and it kind of

336
00:33:30.72 --> 00:33:40.56
feels like the way I feel he likes the taste of blood you know what I mean and even though

337
00:33:41.28 --> 00:33:45.76
I'm kind of the same way like I feel like you know I'm pretty mellow I mean I don't

338
00:33:45.76 --> 00:33:50.56
I don't have anything I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody I guess maybe I am in some ways

339
00:33:50.56 --> 00:34:01.20
but I'm pretty mellow but I still I like the taste of blood and I love that feeling of combat

340
00:34:02.08 --> 00:34:08.80
and that's kind of what you sense that's what I sense from Hixon and so yeah awesome and

341
00:34:09.76 --> 00:34:16.08
maybe we'll have him on here sometime yeah X-Curries he does have that mystique though that's

342
00:34:16.08 --> 00:34:21.20
it is crazy how bad is you know and it's because it's real yeah because it's real you can go

343
00:34:21.20 --> 00:34:27.12
and I guess I said Google Hixon Gracie stories Hixon Gracie Black Belt stories there's stories

344
00:34:27.12 --> 00:34:33.28
where he would line up 10 Black Belt and say I'm gonna submit you all with an arm lock on your

345
00:34:33.28 --> 00:34:40.88
right arm and he would do it and he would do it and that's and so yeah that build you some

346
00:34:40.88 --> 00:34:48.96
mystique for sure yeah I one time I went I was gonna film with him just like a quick video

347
00:34:48.96 --> 00:34:56.96
clearly it's me and Halec so we went to Crohn's Academy of Crongraci the Academy and so I get there

348
00:34:56.96 --> 00:35:02.88
and he's there already you know and he'd so guys were leaving they were done training guys

349
00:35:02.88 --> 00:35:09.52
were leaving and Halec's like hey I'm gonna be like 45 minutes to an hour late so it's just me and

350
00:35:09.52 --> 00:35:15.60
Hixon there no hole like everyone's gone so he's like yeah I was like oh yeah I'm here oh no

351
00:35:15.60 --> 00:35:21.04
is there to film me I would have been you got your gear gear gear gear gear gear pants on

352
00:35:21.68 --> 00:35:28.72
I was scared I submitted to the mystique but no we're you know we were waiting for Halec

353
00:35:28.72 --> 00:35:33.04
oh yeah Halec to me and you know later whatever he was like yeah I know he told me whatever so he's

354
00:35:33.04 --> 00:35:37.36
like he's kind of just they're looking at me so we just sit down I got to talk to Hixon Gracie

355
00:35:37.36 --> 00:35:43.68
for like 50 minutes just about whatever you know and he's kind of looking at me like as if to say like

356
00:35:43.68 --> 00:35:47.68
so what up you know who are you what are we doing you know like all cool but he's still

357
00:35:47.68 --> 00:35:54.000
Hixon Gracie so my mind kept while we were talking my mind kept going into like jumping outside

358
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.80
of my brain and thinking like look what you're doing right now you're sitting with Hixon you know

359
00:35:58.80 --> 00:36:02.64
how like after we roll and we don't have anywhere to be we'll be just talking about stuff

360
00:36:02.64 --> 00:36:07.68
just sitting there most people that's how and I was doing that with Hixon Gracie just me and him

361
00:36:07.68 --> 00:36:12.48
but that's crazy right I mean as you know as someone who knew I know who that is from the

362
00:36:12.48 --> 00:36:17.92
beginning even before I even started you did see I know who that is so yeah man I was like how

363
00:36:17.92 --> 00:36:23.60
I you know that was funny too is bad that night back in the day he brought he brought his sons

364
00:36:23.60 --> 00:36:29.44
one so Hixon was there and Cron was there Cron was a little yeah he did man tiny kid

365
00:36:29.44 --> 00:36:34.000
and Fabio told him that I was in the sealed teams and stuff and that's you know so he

366
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.12
he told me had a little conversation that's another funny thing he said uh so when we got

367
00:36:39.12 --> 00:36:46.40
done rolling it and we were talking like he was the same and he says to me he goes you know

368
00:36:46.40 --> 00:36:50.96
say hey you know thanks to Rome whatever he goes yeah he said uh you're you're you're very comfortable

369
00:36:50.96 --> 00:36:59.36
in bad positions hey right off we'll take it I'll take it yeah it's I do this

370
00:36:59.36 --> 00:37:04.08
to some of those when people used to ask me hey what was it like rolling with Hixon I'd say okay

371
00:37:04.08 --> 00:37:08.000
let me get in your guard and then I'd get in their guard and then say okay now and then I'd say

372
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.48
okay now just relax and let me pass and then I would just pass their guard and mountain I

373
00:37:12.48 --> 00:37:20.16
say that's what it feels like yeah yeah very comfortable in bad that's kind of like

374
00:37:20.16 --> 00:37:25.36
after you like box a guy you say hey you can take punches really basically basically

375
00:37:25.36 --> 00:37:30.000
your face is tough and that's another thing I mean I kind of held onto that like I always

376
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.20
like to come from one bad position yeah Dean it's really good because when you know I

377
00:37:35.20 --> 00:37:42.64
train with Dean all the time and so you know there's no one that that I roll with on a regular

378
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:48.000
basis I don't roll with some really good guys but when Dean is mounted on you or when Dean is on

379
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.20
side control on you it is insufferable it's a bad position and especially because like I'll

380
00:37:57.20 --> 00:38:02.96
roll with I roll with other really high level guys that aren't from our school and when I roll with

381
00:38:02.96 --> 00:38:08.96
them if they get a position like that they don't know exactly my every little escape Dean

382
00:38:08.96 --> 00:38:13.84
knows exactly knows you know all 14 of my escapes he knows them all so you're more trapped

383
00:38:13.84 --> 00:38:19.84
and it's the same with him when I get to position I know what he's gonna do I know and so

384
00:38:19.84 --> 00:38:26.64
he and I joke about it you know but neither one of us want the other person to be especially

385
00:38:26.64 --> 00:38:33.60
across side you know we don't want that yeah that's actually it's an I guess it's an accident

386
00:38:33.60 --> 00:38:39.28
boxing too if you can take punches for sure but comfortable in bad positions in jujitsu is kind

387
00:38:39.28 --> 00:38:43.92
of like back when you're talking about the when you're in water and things are going bad yeah

388
00:38:43.92 --> 00:38:47.76
don't panic don't panic so if you're comfortable in bad positions that's like you have the

389
00:38:47.76 --> 00:38:52.24
ability to yet to not panic and that helps so much because when you panic you gas you're you make

390
00:38:52.24 --> 00:38:56.72
stupid mistakes oh yeah and you just you make stupid mistakes so yeah man I'm just gonna push this

391
00:38:56.72 --> 00:39:02.96
leg out of here oh no he's grabbing my arm yeah he wanted you to do it's good compliment

392
00:39:02.96 --> 00:39:11.44
that next question in podcast 54 the armed forces officer remember that book the armed forces officer

393
00:39:11.44 --> 00:39:17.84
yeah one of my 15 1950 edition yeah can you expound on the difference between these two

394
00:39:17.84 --> 00:39:25.04
these two seemingly contradictory quotes from the manual a firmhold at the beginning pays

395
00:39:25.04 --> 00:39:30.80
tenfold dividend of the team it approach followed by a show of firmness later on from general

396
00:39:30.80 --> 00:39:36.88
malone story of the world world one compared with and general malones if you remember the story was

397
00:39:36.88 --> 00:39:41.44
there's a messed up unit and he went in there was like all right get squared away get these

398
00:39:41.44 --> 00:39:45.52
boards in place get out of the mud what you need to get your uniforms together just tighten

399
00:39:45.52 --> 00:39:54.16
about all right like firmness right and then compared to here's a quote it's a mistake for an

400
00:39:54.16 --> 00:39:59.36
officer on taking a new post to order sweeping changes affecting the other man in the belief that

401
00:39:59.36 --> 00:40:04.48
this will give him a reputation for action and firmness the studying of situations is the

402
00:40:04.48 --> 00:40:10.64
overture of the setting of it and that's from general malone and general malone if you remember

403
00:40:10.64 --> 00:40:17.44
that one he said hey none of you guys are being these positions unless you would do in things right

404
00:40:17.44 --> 00:40:20.96
so I assume that you're doing a good job and we're gonna continue what you're doing that's what he said

405
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:25.28
when he took over so what's going on here is you got two completely different situations and the two

406
00:40:25.28 --> 00:40:32.64
situations are one is a guy taking over first situation a known bad situation the troops are lacking

407
00:40:32.64 --> 00:40:36.64
discipline they're not executing the mission and if you remember for that story they weren't even

408
00:40:36.64 --> 00:40:41.04
doing basic military bearing they didn't they weren't saluting the officers they just had

409
00:40:41.04 --> 00:40:45.12
thrown everything out the window that's the situation we got to come and you got to get firm out of the

410
00:40:45.12 --> 00:40:50.56
gate that's what you got to do now they got to know that they got to know that things are

411
00:40:50.56 --> 00:40:55.76
gonna change they got to know it's real they got to know there's a new plan and they got to know what

412
00:40:55.76 --> 00:41:00.24
that new plan is and then they got to know that there's new standards and they got to know what the new

413
00:41:00.24 --> 00:41:06.40
standards are boom and it's the same thing you know hack worth he did that he came in with some

414
00:41:06.40 --> 00:41:11.20
you know if you remember when he took over the hard core battalion what became the hard core battalion

415
00:41:11.20 --> 00:41:15.04
the first thing he did was like all those radios and guitars and all this crap that you have

416
00:41:15.04 --> 00:41:18.88
sitting around base put it all in the middle of the base tomorrow and we're getting rid of it all

417
00:41:18.88 --> 00:41:28.16
that was a big change now hack worth then he then he started implementing two changes a day if you

418
00:41:28.16 --> 00:41:32.48
remember hey gotta get everyone carry your weapon at all times that's the next change okay get

419
00:41:32.48 --> 00:41:36.96
you're helmet okay now we got to get helmet covers on he just made one two one or two small

420
00:41:36.96 --> 00:41:41.12
changes a day after he made some big sweeping changes out of the gate because it was a jacked up

421
00:41:41.12 --> 00:41:48.24
battalion and now now the difference is if you're going into a situation where everything's going

422
00:41:48.24 --> 00:41:54.40
fine or okay or at a bare minimum it's like normal well then you don't need to step in there and

423
00:41:54.40 --> 00:41:59.68
show that you're the man by making these sweeping changes you don't need to do that it comes across

424
00:41:59.68 --> 00:42:04.16
it comes across like the people that you just took charge of have no idea what they're doing

425
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:10.08
and you don't you don't respect what they did what they what their methodology you don't respect

426
00:42:10.08 --> 00:42:14.72
their their performance because you're coming in saying oh echo by the way the way you

427
00:42:14.72 --> 00:42:18.96
report court the podcast you need to get rid of those microphones you need to edit it tighter your

428
00:42:18.96 --> 00:42:26.000
basis to you know what would you be thinking if I came in and said that well you know mean a little

429
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.84
bit different but you know I understand your point being if somebody comes in and starts criticizing

430
00:42:31.84 --> 00:42:35.92
you right when you're doing a good job you know you're doing a good job yeah

431
00:42:36.64 --> 00:42:39.76
me said I think you're doing a good job thanks there's something that get on you about that

432
00:42:39.76 --> 00:42:45.36
basic usually that's you're it that's really on you you know you're just your base but yeah

433
00:42:46.08 --> 00:42:54.24
extreme so that's the thing if that's the decision you got to make and guess what it's not black

434
00:42:54.24 --> 00:42:58.72
and white you don't go into some units it's not like you're gonna get a choice between a unit that's

435
00:42:58.72 --> 00:43:03.52
doing horrible and a unit that's doing great you're gonna get everything in between and therefore

436
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:09.36
you have to modulate your leadership to reflect if it's if it's a group that might have a tendency

437
00:43:09.36 --> 00:43:14.08
of being a little bit jacked up and they're getting close guess what got to got to be maybe not

438
00:43:14.08 --> 00:43:18.24
sweeping changes but you might need to make a little statement right if it's a group that's

439
00:43:18.24 --> 00:43:24.64
performing awesome fantastic top top team top whatever you might need to come and say hey guys I see

440
00:43:24.64 --> 00:43:28.88
that you're doing great I'm here to just keep you guys doing what you're doing let me know what you

441
00:43:28.88 --> 00:43:35.36
need to support oh and it could be anywhere in between that that's spectrum that's why leadership

442
00:43:35.36 --> 00:43:39.44
is challenging because you got to be able you got to have new arms you got to be able to modulate

443
00:43:40.56 --> 00:43:45.52
you're gonna figure out where that is and you got to test it out too once you give that sweeping

444
00:43:45.52 --> 00:43:50.48
order you got to see what kind of reaction you got you know you got to see the people just

445
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:56.08
instantly rebel okay then let's talk this let's get some feedback what's going on clearly we have

446
00:43:56.08 --> 00:43:59.60
a disrespect scenario going on we need to get the bottom dust let me get some key leaders in here let

447
00:43:59.60 --> 00:44:03.68
me talk to them get some feedback which you should do that before you make any sweeping changes

448
00:44:03.68 --> 00:44:08.24
anyway you got to at least talk to the key leadership get them in the game get them on board

449
00:44:10.24 --> 00:44:13.60
that's why leadership is awesome that's why beat that's why this stuff is so fun because it's

450
00:44:13.60 --> 00:44:18.88
challenging it's different every single time yeah it feels like um kind of like what we're talking

451
00:44:18.88 --> 00:44:24.96
about earlier where if you start to understand the formula all the different details that come out you

452
00:44:24.96 --> 00:44:29.76
can kind of apply the formula in one way and even then still dynamic but but you can you can just get a

453
00:44:29.76 --> 00:44:35.36
better grasp it's just like jujitsu can if you understand the concept yeah that you have to be

454
00:44:35.36 --> 00:44:38.56
able to move your hips there's a bunch of different ways you can get your hips moving right if you

455
00:44:38.56 --> 00:44:42.64
understand the concept that you need to immobilize the hips to pass the guard if you understand

456
00:44:42.64 --> 00:44:46.40
that concept there's all kinds of different ways you can do if you understand the concept of

457
00:44:46.40 --> 00:44:51.92
totally jacked up team is gonna need a sweeping change to get their attention and get them

458
00:44:51.92 --> 00:44:56.000
to understand that things are gonna change and what they were doing is unacceptable if you

459
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.68
understand that concept that that's what it's gonna take you can apply it all the way through

460
00:44:59.68 --> 00:45:04.32
those gradations all the way down to hey this team is doing great and I don't need to change

461
00:45:04.32 --> 00:45:11.12
much I just need to give them the support that they need um conceptual instruction very important

462
00:45:11.12 --> 00:45:18.24
so on it next week juggle I recently listened to the strategic con podcast while on my

463
00:45:18.24 --> 00:45:24.48
way to coach lacrosse and I was impressed how many of the points made between both Maurice and your

464
00:45:24.48 --> 00:45:29.52
experience as an operator translated into the field another point of the cast that stuck out

465
00:45:29.52 --> 00:45:36.000
and now I reflect on as learning experience and coachable moment for myself was the saying of

466
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.60
good work when we recently battled through the first half the game lacrosse game it was a

467
00:45:43.60 --> 00:45:47.04
graduate man actually in this one he's talked I edited a little bit out of this because he had

468
00:45:47.04 --> 00:45:52.48
really long email and we believe in brevity around here so he's actually now talking about a

469
00:45:52.48 --> 00:45:57.92
soccer match a grudge match that they're playing okay so boom that a hard first half it was a

470
00:45:57.92 --> 00:46:02.88
grudge match I'm very evenly played until until the half when I told the boys they were doing

471
00:46:02.88 --> 00:46:08.000
good work out there and that we were matching their intensity and putting pressure on them then

472
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.68
the first 30 seconds of the second half we were scored on due to lack of intensity and follow through

473
00:46:13.68 --> 00:46:19.76
I suspect it may have been from my good job quote unquote good work keep it up talk we had in

474
00:46:19.76 --> 00:46:27.52
that the half time my question to you is how does one reinforce the fact they were hitting hard

475
00:46:27.52 --> 00:46:33.84
up there give them some words of encouragement and send them back out without taking a hit in intensity

476
00:46:33.84 --> 00:46:38.88
as a coach of freshman high school boys who are basically wild dogs and need direction plus

477
00:46:38.88 --> 00:46:45.04
support what could have done different to keep the intensity up in the second half and even after

478
00:46:45.04 --> 00:46:49.92
getting scored on so this is this is pretty simple and I've actually talked about this before

479
00:46:50.80 --> 00:46:56.48
I've talked about it with regards to MMA and I've talked about it with regards to my seal

480
00:46:56.48 --> 00:47:02.80
platoon my seal task unit and that is that you have to be very careful with praise oh yeah

481
00:47:02.80 --> 00:47:08.88
because in the example that I give in the corner of MMA fights as if you tell a guy hey good job you

482
00:47:08.88 --> 00:47:12.88
know you well you won that last round keep just keep doing what you're doing

483
00:47:12.88 --> 00:47:18.88
he's gonna back off yeah he's gonna back off and guess what the other corners tell them you lost that

484
00:47:18.88 --> 00:47:22.48
round you need to step it up you need to get aggressive and that's what they're gonna do

485
00:47:22.48 --> 00:47:29.60
they're gonna get out there because I'll say most people in an MMA fight MMA fight is a

486
00:47:29.60 --> 00:47:34.64
it's like wrestling it's a very intense cardio activity you're good everybody's gonna be tired

487
00:47:34.64 --> 00:47:39.28
be just about everybody obviously so when you get two guys well let me let me

488
00:47:39.28 --> 00:47:43.68
refray that when you get two guys that are evenly matched and are going at it hard they're both

489
00:47:43.68 --> 00:47:48.000
gonna be tired and so they're gonna want a little bit of rest so if you give them that opportunity

490
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.24
to back off the throttle just a little bit subconsciously they're gonna do it because they think

491
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:57.84
they're doing good they think that won that last round so you can see that all the time you see

492
00:47:57.84 --> 00:48:04.40
I mean it happened it happened with Ronda you know they're saying hey good job good job

493
00:48:04.40 --> 00:48:11.60
you're looking good and she's getting crushed I mean that's kind of a bad example but anyways

494
00:48:11.60 --> 00:48:17.44
you got to be careful that in and I've told the story before but when my task was going through training

495
00:48:18.16 --> 00:48:25.12
and we were doing CQC so close quarters combat drills we're going in the kill house over and

496
00:48:25.12 --> 00:48:30.88
you know we broke for lunch or something we come back from lunch and the guy that's the cadre

497
00:48:30.88 --> 00:48:36.88
right they're like hey you guys are kicking ass this is great keep it up you guys are the best

498
00:48:36.88 --> 00:48:42.48
task you know we've seen out here you guys crushing it and literally the next run guys going

499
00:48:42.48 --> 00:48:46.56
to house they screw everything up they missed targets just a disaster and I talked to the

500
00:48:46.56 --> 00:48:50.96
country and like don't ever tell my guys again that they're the best guys in the world don't

501
00:48:50.96 --> 00:48:54.80
don't tell them that you can tell them good job but don't be telling them they're the best

502
00:48:56.08 --> 00:49:00.80
people in the world just tells them work and so that's kind of what happened you know here

503
00:49:00.80 --> 00:49:05.20
now the thing is this doesn't mean that you can never give anybody credit or never give

504
00:49:05.20 --> 00:49:09.52
anyone praise because you absolutely have to do that but what you have to do you have to

505
00:49:09.52 --> 00:49:16.48
proactively counteract the mental lapse and intensity that's about to take place because you

506
00:49:16.48 --> 00:49:24.64
just compliment them so how do you do that so let's say you're on the LaCrosse field or the

507
00:49:24.64 --> 00:49:31.20
soccer field you bring the boys in you say look guys good half good first half you took it to

508
00:49:32.64 --> 00:49:38.32
you showed them that we can hang with them you play them even that's fine here's the problem

509
00:49:39.36 --> 00:49:46.32
even isn't good enough we need to get out there and play harder we need to step it up I

510
00:49:46.32 --> 00:49:50.96
actually want you guys to play like mergers that's what I want you to want you to win every loose

511
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:55.92
ball I want you to make every tackle I want you to get your head on every ball that's in the air

512
00:49:55.92 --> 00:50:02.96
you stick to them on defense I don't even want them to be able to breathe I want you to work

513
00:50:02.96 --> 00:50:08.88
them into the ground I want pressure pressure upfront pressure in the midfield and pressure on

514
00:50:08.88 --> 00:50:15.60
D you make them fight for every inch every ball and every breath I want you to go out there and take

515
00:50:15.60 --> 00:50:23.52
their souls so you gotta count on the head you know you gotta count on the good job thing so

516
00:50:23.52 --> 00:50:28.32
in MMA it's the same thing you know hey good round there's a close round but a good round but listen

517
00:50:29.52 --> 00:50:33.84
you can't let up right now you need to step it up he knows he has to step it up and telling you

518
00:50:33.84 --> 00:50:37.76
he knows he's got to step it up and if you come out weak he's going to get the upper hand right away

519
00:50:37.76 --> 00:50:47.12
you need to put him away you need to go out there and crush him crush his soul turn it on

520
00:50:47.84 --> 00:50:56.16
and put this guy away I want you to kill him so that's what you need to do with that now for tactical

521
00:50:56.16 --> 00:51:01.76
training same thing because you know I know this police officers and swap teams and you guys

522
00:51:01.76 --> 00:51:04.88
that are in the military you're doing tactical training all the time and you're going to see

523
00:51:04.88 --> 00:51:10.32
the as the team comes together they're going to start to do good but like I said if you give them too much

524
00:51:11.76 --> 00:51:16.000
they're going to slack right so you know when you're running your tactical training

525
00:51:16.88 --> 00:51:21.52
for your guys you say look hey guys let's see some good progress out there we're making some good

526
00:51:21.52 --> 00:51:29.60
runs let me tell you it's not good enough right right now okay this is the deal the enemy can

527
00:51:29.60 --> 00:51:36.64
rely on luck we can't we rely on our training we trained to be prepared for anything that the

528
00:51:36.64 --> 00:51:43.44
enemy throws at us so we're going to work as hard as we can and be as perfect as we can so we are

529
00:51:43.44 --> 00:51:49.84
ready for the worst case scenario so get jacked up for another run right now and I want you to go in

530
00:51:49.84 --> 00:51:58.24
there like a band of blood thirsty Viking shock troops on a damn berserker rage and crush this

531
00:52:00.72 --> 00:52:08.32
see you want to bring that kind of counter right and then in combat again and I just was talking

532
00:52:08.32 --> 00:52:14.96
to some guys yesterday and it's the same thing like complacency is the worst thing that can happen

533
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:20.80
with your team with your in combat scenario so when you're combat you know it's look hey guys we're

534
00:52:20.80 --> 00:52:29.20
running some good operations right we got the upper hand and that's good but it's not good enough

535
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:37.76
we cannot be complacent and we can't take our foot off the enemy's throat we are going to be

536
00:52:37.76 --> 00:52:44.56
relentless we are not going to give him the chance to regroup he will not get the chance to recover

537
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:49.60
there will be no downtime for the enemy and I'll tell you what I don't even want the enemy to have a

538
00:52:49.60 --> 00:52:58.56
chance to bury their dead we are not going to stop until there is nothing left to pursue and no

539
00:52:58.56 --> 00:53:04.48
one left to bury so sharpen up your knives load up your magazines because we got work to do

540
00:53:04.48 --> 00:53:15.20
so again we got a counter you know the compliments and balance essentially what I'm doing in

541
00:53:15.20 --> 00:53:23.12
each one of those you know situations I'm balancing the positive affirmations of what is happening

542
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:35.92
with some new goals and new objectives that will ensure that there will be no slack so the guy said

543
00:53:37.44 --> 00:53:42.08
that there were ninth graders fresh yeah fresh wind wild dogs yep

544
00:53:42.08 --> 00:53:51.04
next question next question how do you detach without seeming completely cold

545
00:53:53.84 --> 00:53:59.60
okay important question you know I've said this all time you know you got to detach I also say

546
00:53:59.60 --> 00:54:04.24
all the time if you detach from all your emotions that means you're robot people don't fall robots I say it all the time

547
00:54:04.24 --> 00:54:17.60
so when you do detach you can't completely step away but if you do you have to

548
00:54:19.44 --> 00:54:27.36
you have to act you have to do a little acting now first of all we already talked about this right

549
00:54:27.36 --> 00:54:33.36
we already talked about these red flags that that show that you're going to lose your temper

550
00:54:33.36 --> 00:54:37.52
that you're going to get emotional about something you know you're clenched fist in your

551
00:54:37.52 --> 00:54:41.76
raised voice and you're heavy breathing and you're flaired nostrils and all that stuff right

552
00:54:41.76 --> 00:54:45.68
so you know what those things mean those things mean those things you're your signal that mean to

553
00:54:45.68 --> 00:54:53.20
touch okay so you got to work on that now here's the dichotomy of it is once you are there

554
00:54:53.20 --> 00:55:05.68
and once you have detached you actually have to now go back and do one or some of those things that

555
00:55:05.68 --> 00:55:11.44
you are trying not to do you have to go and you have to do them a little bit in a nice little

556
00:55:11.44 --> 00:55:19.04
controlled manner right maybe raise your voice a little bit maybe you just kind of clenched your

557
00:55:19.04 --> 00:55:24.40
jaw and remember I said you like like nodding your head in a positive way and that's it that's a

558
00:55:24.40 --> 00:55:29.52
when you if you're coming to me with an issue and I nod my head to the affirmative you know up

559
00:55:29.52 --> 00:55:34.80
announcing yes I understand yes I understand that's a soothing thing to your team right they see

560
00:55:34.80 --> 00:55:40.40
that you're you're okay with it the opposite of that is when you shake your head to in the negative

561
00:55:40.40 --> 00:55:43.60
like if you're telling me some problem and I'm shaking my head it's like I'm me going

562
00:55:43.60 --> 00:55:48.88
to tear my can't believe this is going on right so yeah so maybe that's another thing you you

563
00:55:48.88 --> 00:55:52.48
clenched your jaw and you shake your head just show the person like look I know we're in a bad way

564
00:55:52.48 --> 00:55:56.64
I get it I'm not sitting back here like it's no big deal I know it's going to be a tough I know we just

565
00:55:57.28 --> 00:56:02.16
lost a sale or I know we just you know I'm going to have to plan another mission that we just

566
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:08.96
got back I understand that it's hard you care I care you know I'm I'm with you you want to give

567
00:56:08.96 --> 00:56:14.48
that maybe you let out that little sigh of frustration you know like a little like something like that right

568
00:56:14.48 --> 00:56:19.68
just gonna do that little thing just do that let's just show in that you do got some emotions and

569
00:56:19.68 --> 00:56:30.48
you are invested in all that stuff and and then once once you see that you've achieved your goal here

570
00:56:30.48 --> 00:56:36.16
that you can see that that they see that you have some emotions on the situation

571
00:56:36.16 --> 00:56:43.12
then you you quickly get yourself to recover from that right you get yourself composed

572
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.44
and you show them and they and they've seen it so it was like a little bit see like a little

573
00:56:47.44 --> 00:56:51.84
weakness and they go okay you know tacos are human related yeah yeah he's bad but you know I

574
00:56:51.84 --> 00:56:57.04
actually want him to calm down yeah I actually am a glad he's so good yeah I'm easy into it but

575
00:56:57.04 --> 00:57:03.12
I'm glad he's calming down that's good okay so then you recover you go back to your calm cool

576
00:57:03.12 --> 00:57:08.96
collect itself right that's what we're gonna do now like I said this is do we call this acting

577
00:57:10.24 --> 00:57:15.12
I guess maybe we could call an acting but at the same time acting means you're trying to

578
00:57:15.12 --> 00:57:18.56
pretend to be somebody right you're not trying to pretend to be anybody else you're being you

579
00:57:19.28 --> 00:57:25.28
that's all you're doing you're being you you're just acting like yourself just showing a little bit more

580
00:57:25.28 --> 00:57:33.36
of the emotion and then you would be if you were just completely detached so it's not like

581
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:40.56
you're trying to act like some you know yeah you're not trying to play a role if someone

582
00:57:40.56 --> 00:57:45.60
wants to just be new so and you already know what you do because you've learned how what the signals

583
00:57:45.60 --> 00:57:49.60
are so when you know that you raise your voice and that means you're okay the just raise your voice a

584
00:57:49.60 --> 00:57:54.40
little bit if you know that you just give a little sides it's those careful

585
00:57:54.40 --> 00:58:04.16
things and so yeah I guess it is acting in a way but it's not fallen anybody can do it I think yeah

586
00:58:04.16 --> 00:58:12.08
yeah you did I think that's great this is my opinion you do with your kids you know I mean I'm you know

587
00:58:12.08 --> 00:58:17.76
like you've got to pretend to act yeah you know you mad or whatever any good even happy even

588
00:58:17.76 --> 00:58:26.64
pretend to be happy well okay we'll say excited yeah yeah I got something for you it's a drawing

589
00:58:26.64 --> 00:58:33.44
of a happy face same as she did yesterday you know it's like I'm not the honest truth is

590
00:58:34.08 --> 00:58:41.68
I'm excited about other things we'll just say that that's gross I'm all those I love all that love

591
00:58:41.68 --> 00:58:45.92
you got for crying about the fact that you're getting better you're getting better you're

592
00:58:45.92 --> 00:58:50.08
gonna know I look it's all going backwards now people are gonna hate you now don't

593
00:58:50.08 --> 00:58:53.68
grab talk about it exactly you're daughter draws your beautiful picture you know

594
00:58:53.68 --> 00:58:59.76
care about it it's a cold blood it what I'm gonna give her is a lot of excitement I'm gonna

595
00:58:59.76 --> 00:59:04.000
match her excitement maybe we can go one level higher that's what I'm gonna give her so what am I

596
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.76
acting I'm excited about a lot of things a little bit though yeah you're same thing same thing yeah

597
00:59:09.76 --> 00:59:17.84
uh that was messed up by the way same thing yeah it's it is a form of manipulation it might

598
00:59:17.84 --> 00:59:21.60
be a little bit of form of manipulation but again if you're doing it to help the individual

599
00:59:21.60 --> 00:59:26.48
you're doing it to help the team then isn't manipulation or is it leadership I say of course

600
00:59:26.48 --> 00:59:32.000
it's leadership you're not manipulation is I'm trying to fool you so you do things that I want

601
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.32
you do that to the kitchen we're not doing that it's not what we're running here

602
00:59:36.32 --> 00:59:44.88
check all right next question next question please discuss how discipline in one area doesn't

603
00:59:44.88 --> 00:59:50.64
make up for slack in other areas for example the fitness guru who has no saving

604
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:58.48
yeah you know this is something that we all have to work out watch out for is the fact that

605
00:59:58.48 --> 01:00:04.40
we we focus on our strengths right that's what we do that's what people do so

606
01:00:04.40 --> 01:00:09.84
you get a person that's smart you know really intellectual person and they let themselves

607
01:00:09.84 --> 01:00:16.16
go physically you know or you get a person that's a physical stud but then they're not going

608
01:00:16.16 --> 01:00:23.04
to challenge their brain power or like the question that was you know the example here that was

609
01:00:23.04 --> 01:00:28.88
posed you know someone that's a fitness guru or a party guru I'm throwing that one out there

610
01:00:28.88 --> 01:00:35.04
because some people really good at or they you know they're on entrepreneur coming on

611
01:00:35.04 --> 01:00:42.32
entrepreneur and so they're driving a numerous 80s but it's least and they're behind on payments

612
01:00:42.32 --> 01:00:51.28
right so on strategic yeah yeah yeah that so you know I mean you take another example is

613
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:56.24
what about the business person that doesn't have time for their family right and so that's not good

614
01:00:56.24 --> 01:01:04.80
so I think the focus here is do we try and we all have to be try to be well-rounded and not

615
01:01:04.80 --> 01:01:09.44
focus so much on one area that you're gonna let some other area go that's target fixation is

616
01:01:09.44 --> 01:01:14.24
what that is right is you walk into a room and you get fixated on one target you won bad guy

617
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:18.000
you think there's one bad guy so you focus all your energy and then you're getting flanked

618
01:01:18.56 --> 01:01:21.52
that's target fixation you can't let that happen you can't let it happen on the battlefield

619
01:01:21.52 --> 01:01:28.80
you can't let it happen on life so look out for that when you do this um and I'll tell you this is

620
01:01:28.80 --> 01:01:37.36
actually a reality of the situation I try and maintain this balance but I've been actually working

621
01:01:37.36 --> 01:01:47.44
a lot lately and what and this is a clear indicator to me that I've overbooked myself is last week

622
01:01:47.44 --> 01:01:56.000
we had to skip a day of jiu-jitsu to record me we don't do that right when do we record

623
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.56
rear-port after jiu-jitsu but I knew I had so much stuff going on that I said hey we got it we

624
01:02:02.56 --> 01:02:06.08
got to record at this time because I got to get this other stuff done because I'm traveling

625
01:02:06.08 --> 01:02:10.72
in this and that and so we had to skip the jiu-jitsu so that is a red flag to me

626
01:02:10.72 --> 01:02:16.88
that says I need to I need to tighten up I need to get my you know get my schedule back and check

627
01:02:17.76 --> 01:02:22.88
so that I can do the things that I need to do of course what do I say about the situation

628
01:02:24.08 --> 01:02:28.32
it's fine you know what can't train jiu-jitsu that day because I'm trying I got some travel coming up good

629
01:02:29.04 --> 01:02:33.04
I'm gonna heal up my shoulder a little bit more I'm gonna it's you know I'm gonna it's it's good's fine

630
01:02:33.04 --> 01:02:39.84
but it is an indicator of when things start going in the wrong direction maybe I'm getting

631
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:48.96
targeted fixated on you know too much work at a certain time which to me again I will run this thing

632
01:02:48.96 --> 01:02:54.56
in the red as you say I like I like running in the red right I'm in the red and I got no problem

633
01:02:54.56 --> 01:03:02.72
like we will go hard and the numbers of hours I've been where I will work we'll have actually

634
01:03:02.72 --> 01:03:07.12
no impact on how much I'm gonna spend with my family and djiu-jitsu and all that so because I'll just do it all

635
01:03:07.92 --> 01:03:12.56
but there is a capacity that you reach where you go okay now one of these things that is just

636
01:03:12.56 --> 01:03:21.28
started to slide now I need to make sure that my levels get re-re-re-leveled I guess you might say

637
01:03:21.28 --> 01:03:29.04
equalized is what I should have said so back to the subject don't be a one trick pony you know

638
01:03:29.04 --> 01:03:34.32
be a jack of all trades and then master a few of those trades so you can emphasize

639
01:03:35.04 --> 01:03:41.84
vignis guru you can emphasize intellectual power you can emphasize jiu-jitsu

640
01:03:43.52 --> 01:03:49.28
but don't put a hundred percent of your effort into one area because

641
01:03:50.16 --> 01:03:55.68
eventually it will take you you won't have anything else and by the way

642
01:03:55.68 --> 01:04:01.60
if you put all your you know if you put all your all your eggs in the basket of intellectual power

643
01:04:01.60 --> 01:04:07.28
now you're unhealthy and you die right that doesn't you know let me care how smart you are you can't

644
01:04:07.28 --> 01:04:16.56
do two plus two when you're dead so don't put all your focus a hundred percent into one area

645
01:04:16.56 --> 01:04:23.60
don't become unbalanced in your disciplines spread it around an old line yeah it's good

646
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:35.36
yeah I get I kind of feels like like you can be understood that it's a real good

647
01:04:35.36 --> 01:04:43.68
it I don't know fitness and it's easy to justify yourself you know like you're you're

648
01:04:43.68 --> 01:04:48.88
let's say okay I'm real good at fitness you know fitness guru and I go around and then I see

649
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:55.60
I don't know I go to the store go to some party and I see this other guy who's like socially he's

650
01:04:55.60 --> 01:05:00.88
just hundred percent everyone likes he's such a nice charismatic guy he makes a lot of money

651
01:05:01.52 --> 01:05:06.88
you know and all this stuff but he's not in that good shape we're out of no he smokes and whatever you know

652
01:05:06.88 --> 01:05:12.88
that it's easy I think a lot of people it feels like it's easy to justify wolf that guy's in

653
01:05:12.88 --> 01:05:17.68
bad shape so who cares I wouldn't want any of that I wouldn't want all the money you know all this stuff

654
01:05:17.68 --> 01:05:22.80
it seems like you just gotta justify that and you know what the other guy's saying yeah you

655
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:28.72
might be in good shape guess what yeah nice Toyota Corolla your driving he's all negative on it

656
01:05:28.72 --> 01:05:34.88
yeah yeah so both those guys should you should instead of saying hey you know what they should

657
01:05:34.88 --> 01:05:38.16
do walk up and be like hey man you know what I noticed you're pretty successful financially

658
01:05:38.88 --> 01:05:44.16
I would like to get in the game with you a little bit and learn from you about that and the other

659
01:05:44.16 --> 01:05:48.80
guys should take them well you know what it looks like you're in pretty good fitness levels I would

660
01:05:48.80 --> 01:05:54.72
like to get in the game with that let's work together and improve ourselves and go out and kick

661
01:05:54.72 --> 01:06:01.68
ass and dominate are you in I mean let's do this instead what is a normal person do they do exactly what

662
01:06:01.68 --> 01:06:09.20
you said justify criticize cut people down instead of building them up yeah and what you have to be

663
01:06:09.20 --> 01:06:15.44
careful of if I was to go to you and say hey you know echo I got a lot of money I can tell you

664
01:06:15.44 --> 01:06:19.60
don't have a lot I'll help you out that's that can be offensive to some people yeah because you think

665
01:06:19.60 --> 01:06:23.76
you think you are yeah you're not really about that good you're hell I'm gonna work about money

666
01:06:24.48 --> 01:06:31.20
think I'm worried about money when I got abs like these you so what we have to do is instead

667
01:06:31.20 --> 01:06:37.04
of if you if I came to you and said echo dude I want abs like you got sure let can you help me

668
01:06:37.04 --> 01:06:42.96
get in the game and then we formed a little relationship and now I said you man so what you what

669
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:46.80
you mean income is dream dude you know what are you doing and you say well you know I got these two

670
01:06:46.80 --> 01:06:52.16
clients you got a website no not really why don't you have a website you got any social media to

671
01:06:52.16 --> 01:06:57.52
advertise you know we go that road and we build up we take care of each other so we want to do as

672
01:06:57.52 --> 01:07:04.08
people yeah kind of like you ever seen the guys who go they see like a football player or something

673
01:07:04.08 --> 01:07:10.08
like I kick his ass though you know that can you can always like some success for us and I

674
01:07:10.08 --> 01:07:15.60
he I kick his ass though yeah yeah yeah well I've told the story in the scene in the

675
01:07:15.60 --> 01:07:24.32
seal teams it's no one no one is good if a guy like we have guys in the seal teams that are literally

676
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:33.04
you know world class athletes in whatever world class triathlete world class sailor world class

677
01:07:33.04 --> 01:07:39.60
whatever and so oh you owe your your world class triathlete oh yeah that guys really good

678
01:07:39.60 --> 01:07:45.36
triathlete that's cool he's a really bad shot someone is gonna try man and cut him down

679
01:07:45.36 --> 01:07:53.84
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no slack no slack that's slack right look a one more thing so

680
01:07:53.84 --> 01:08:02.64
uh jockel would you confront an individual team member when reported by other team

681
01:08:02.64 --> 01:08:09.76
members that they're talking smack about you what would you just ignore the old classic here

682
01:08:09.76 --> 01:08:15.20
what do you do about the about the negative guy that's trying to bring you down

683
01:08:15.20 --> 01:08:26.24
and sure you can you can confront them right and you can by doing that join in there

684
01:08:27.04 --> 01:08:36.32
in their little game and in doing that you give them the satisfaction they now know that they

685
01:08:36.32 --> 01:08:44.88
got into your head and then you're turning your workplace into you know your basic grade school

686
01:08:44.88 --> 01:08:55.76
gossip all so we don't like that but now there are times unfortunately that's you you have to

687
01:08:55.76 --> 01:09:05.68
address things and when you do it you do it professionally and you do it your goal is to disarm them

688
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:10.16
because remember that this negative person inside they

689
01:09:10.16 --> 01:09:18.08
probably want the confrontation that's what they want and so you know you say something like

690
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:24.24
hey I heard you had some critique points for me about how I'm doing my job you know if

691
01:09:24.24 --> 01:09:28.96
I'd love to get your feedback so I can tighten up my game but you just disarm a little bit

692
01:09:30.16 --> 01:09:36.32
and something like that will likely diffuse this scenario a little bit and you know hopefully

693
01:09:36.32 --> 01:09:40.64
the people will under the the person will understand that there are other people that are telling

694
01:09:40.64 --> 01:09:45.20
you what's going on it will kind of put them in check and stifle the situation but

695
01:09:47.20 --> 01:09:56.56
the preferred methodology for this situation for me is quite simple and that is

696
01:09:56.56 --> 01:10:09.76
ignore and outperform them you see while you're over there watching me and talking about me

697
01:10:09.76 --> 01:10:18.80
I'm working I'm working hard I'm taking things to the next level you keep gossiping and I'll keep

698
01:10:18.80 --> 01:10:26.16
working you keep talking smack and I'll keep working you keep focusing on everything and

699
01:10:26.16 --> 01:10:35.68
everyone else and I'll keep working and when you finally look around at where you are and where

700
01:10:35.68 --> 01:10:44.32
I'm at you realize that you have nothing left to talk smack about

701
01:10:47.04 --> 01:10:51.04
and you will lose and I will win

702
01:10:51.04 --> 01:11:03.44
and this here applies to when people are playing office politics or forming their little

703
01:11:03.44 --> 01:11:11.92
clicks or working their personal agendas and again I know sometimes you have to play those games

704
01:11:11.92 --> 01:11:26.000
but let your first course of action let the fundamental core of your reaction be to outwork

705
01:11:27.36 --> 01:11:33.20
and outperform every last one of them

706
01:11:33.20 --> 01:11:44.08
and I think that's all I've got for tonight

707
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.68

710
01:12:06.64 --> 01:12:14.88
Macon 15 all that anyway we'll talk about on it you want to support this podcast support yourself on it

711
01:12:16.08 --> 01:12:22.24
rather cruel oil it's real and I thought about this like I'm kind of lifting kind of hard

712
01:12:22.24 --> 01:12:28.32
and like I do like squats right just very like different kinds of different weights and do you over

713
01:12:28.32 --> 01:12:39.68
it's what sometimes yeah yeah yeah yeah that a lot but just one that that like one that

714
01:12:40.88 --> 01:12:44.96
you can do all it like front squats or something like that but I go all the way down

715
01:12:44.96 --> 01:12:49.04
all the way down okay there's no other way to squat yeah well something sometimes you know

716
01:12:49.04 --> 01:12:53.28
people don't have the flexibility in their feet or their ankles or whatever or you know you lift in like

717
01:12:54.16 --> 01:12:58.88
500 pounds or something right all the way anyway my point is it can be hard on your knees

718
01:13:01.04 --> 01:13:06.24
it can't straight up okay those those are the facts it can be anyway and I'm kind of going

719
01:13:06.24 --> 01:13:10.88
kind of hard nowadays like pretty much every day lift and you get to you know like

720
01:13:10.88 --> 01:13:15.04
harder than I have in the past for sure and I don't have the anyway the crit the point is the

721
01:13:15.04 --> 01:13:23.36
krill oil yeah the krill oil is real well I don't have any pain no pain no pain still come

722
01:13:23.36 --> 01:13:30.40
much so like three a day three in the morning and three at night just three a day yeah

723
01:13:30.40 --> 01:13:36.80
I do twice as much as you well you're bigger and older you mean bigger and yeah yeah yeah

724
01:13:36.80 --> 01:13:49.04
and I was thinking zero before yeah yeah but yeah man it's good krill oil that's what's fun is

725
01:13:49.04 --> 01:13:54.80
when you think supplements that's you think like something is gonna make me stronger you know

726
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.40
if I take it versus don't take it like it's krill does make you stronger but it's like you

727
01:14:00.40 --> 01:14:06.24
to rock out more yeah you know I've been taking krill oil for so long I don't even know what it's like to not take krill

728
01:14:06.24 --> 01:14:13.20
a little anymore yeah things just one big mystery no one big path to victory you know

729
01:14:13.20 --> 01:14:20.64
you know take the krill oil on it ecologically friendly harvesting of krill watch the video

730
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:28.000
on it dot com on it dot com slash jockel if you want 10% off pre-workout which is total strength

731
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.20
and performance he'll give you more strength and more performance my anecdotal shrimp tech

732
01:14:36.64 --> 01:14:42.16
proof by the way I I got on I had a bunch of like I said I've been working a lot

733
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:46.24
I've been traveling a lot we're traveling you're getting on planes with a bunch of people that you don't

734
01:14:46.24 --> 01:14:53.20
know and they have all kinds of germs as do I and two people get sick and I can't be sick and do my

735
01:14:53.20 --> 01:14:56.48
job because I got to go talk to people and meet people and give speeches and all that stuff

736
01:14:56.48 --> 01:15:03.20
so I can't be getting sick so I knew I had critical events coming up so guess what I did

737
01:15:03.92 --> 01:15:10.64
shum tech immune yeah I did this room tech immune power through yeah you're not sick now no I'm not

738
01:15:10.64 --> 01:15:17.84
sick now no training hard surf today so it'd basically end worked out and got after it so

739
01:15:18.40 --> 01:15:23.60
thank immune to the sickness so dang there's another one in the rotation is that we were

740
01:15:23.60 --> 01:15:31.76
yeah and yeah I I cycled it yeah I cycled it because I knew I didn't want to get sick

741
01:15:31.76 --> 01:15:36.72
and I suppose you could just say hey when do you want to get sick right whenever yeah

742
01:15:36.72 --> 01:15:41.20
maybe it's something I should take more off yeah and it's one of those things kind of like

743
01:15:41.20 --> 01:15:47.28
like a like a back-and-computer programmer where you don't really you're not hit by the success

744
01:15:47.28 --> 01:15:51.84
of it you're only hit by the failure of it you know so immune it's a training tech immune

745
01:15:51.84 --> 01:15:57.92
and you take it you don't get sick you're like all right you know it's cool you know but

746
01:15:58.96 --> 01:16:04.72
no I like I say a bunch of events back I thought the TED talk and so what am I gonna show up

747
01:16:04.72 --> 01:16:08.88
to the TED talk coughing can't take that chance yeah yeah I can't take that chance yeah yeah

748
01:16:08.88 --> 01:16:13.52
stop you know stuff you know what what are you gonna do no you can't do those things you gotta show

749
01:16:13.52 --> 01:16:18.80
but have your age game yeah you know so shum tech immune yeah these are good because these are like

750
01:16:18.80 --> 01:16:24.88
um you know how okay so cool let's go cruel I'll where that works your joints work but it's not like

751
01:16:24.88 --> 01:16:30.000
it's like a cortisone shot where you know you just don't feel like when you get off at your jack

752
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.72
you know you're back to zero it's like this is stuff that like helps your body do it you know

753
01:16:34.72 --> 01:16:42.32
that's the good part yeah it's not it's not a foreign horrible substance that you're gonna

754
01:16:42.32 --> 01:16:49.52
become rely on it's so good and well okay yeah they're all good all of them and there's other

755
01:16:49.52 --> 01:16:56.000
stuff there's cool stuff too the the almond it's like a three nut butter blend good to have a

756
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.64
track or me it's good to add it's too bad that's on you bro it's good and yeah this is a lot of stuff

757
01:17:02.64 --> 01:17:07.20
look on there it's protein powder and obviously quality protein powder if you're into protein

758
01:17:07.20 --> 01:17:12.24
powder um from tech for performance the pre work out that's the one bro if you're if you're

759
01:17:12.24 --> 01:17:19.04
lifting and doing hard workouts get to get the pre work out because it's not stimulants that like

760
01:17:19.04 --> 01:17:25.28
you know so so I don't because I work out early in the morning as we know and I don't like working

761
01:17:25.28 --> 01:17:28.88
out on an empty stomach I don't know full stomach so I work out on an empty stomach in the morning

762
01:17:28.88 --> 01:17:36.16
good idea but I and you told me that you might consider this cheating because I will take it

763
01:17:36.16 --> 01:17:43.92
pre-sugits yeah you don't look at you like I'm cheating look at this guy more so it's not

764
01:17:43.92 --> 01:17:50.16
it's but it's not cheating at all but then it also on top of that I don't do it I'll do it

765
01:17:50.16 --> 01:17:56.88
if every heavy hitter is coming to train I'll I'll do it it's the advantage I remember

766
01:17:56.88 --> 01:18:02.56
us rolling with I was on a 72 hour fast and I was like almost at the end of it and I did everything

767
01:18:02.56 --> 01:18:06.64
normal I didn't change anything I squatted I didn't pull up so did everything normal worked out

768
01:18:06.64 --> 01:18:11.76
surf did you get to I was at the end of it and I was rolling the big Eric you know judo Eric

769
01:18:12.80 --> 01:18:18.24
and I said I'm gonna tell you something when we get done so we rolled hard and it was no

770
01:18:18.24 --> 01:18:22.24
it's just been way we normally rolled you know and got after it hard and I said and he said what

771
01:18:22.24 --> 01:18:26.80
were you gonna tell me I said yeah I'm on the tail end of a 72 hour fast right now and he said well

772
01:18:26.80 --> 01:18:30.56
I didn't seem to affect your performance that's it no I don't think it affects your performance at

773
01:18:30.56 --> 01:18:37.92
all yeah just straight up I rolled it somebody and I got him I forget who it was a while ago

774
01:18:37.92 --> 01:18:44.48
but and then and I got him and you could tell he was pissed oh that was it anyway he said oh

775
01:18:44.48 --> 01:18:50.24
one of the first things he said I'm fasting right now yeah I forget who that's and that is that is

776
01:18:50.24 --> 01:18:56.72
actually why I didn't tell Eric right because then it's just an excuse you can also and also

777
01:18:56.72 --> 01:19:01.92
cycle logical warfare right if I tell him hey I'm fasting I'm gonna fast to stay be my

778
01:19:01.92 --> 01:19:06.88
get all fired up no I'm not gonna let that happen do you just who is that I'm

779
01:19:06.88 --> 01:19:12.64
you there's a behind you yeah you just going on even before you were when you clap hands

780
01:19:12.64 --> 01:19:18.24
yeah give that little bump that was an aggressive bump remember that time right after we rolled

781
01:19:18.88 --> 01:19:23.12
and you said hey you know did you feel that I was like kind of getting tired towards the end there

782
01:19:23.12 --> 01:19:33.20
and I said no you're like yeah because that wasn't you're best lying to me yeah well

783
01:19:33.20 --> 01:19:41.76
about that was a good one that was a good one it's it's hard it's hard to get me tired

784
01:19:41.76 --> 01:19:47.60
to do yeah you know what it's actually it's not all conditioning too I just I know how to

785
01:19:47.60 --> 01:19:54.48
conserve some energy yeah but you know how you know what this is what part of it is if not a major

786
01:19:54.48 --> 01:20:00.16
part you can endure fatigue and tiredness if you're enjoying what you're doing that's why for a lot

787
01:20:00.16 --> 01:20:04.48
of people that treadmill is just hell even though the treadmill's not that hard it's like you're going

788
01:20:04.48 --> 01:20:09.68
at like a certain like a low percentage of output it's just so boring there's no like payoff

789
01:20:09.68 --> 01:20:14.72
in jujitsu it's like it's payoff upon payoff upon payoff yeah you pass someone's guard oh my gosh

790
01:20:14.72 --> 01:20:18.24
they pass your guard you're like what the I thought a little wage might be you know it's like

791
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:22.40
this intricate battle you know the mean all you're getting super tired I mean you can't get

792
01:20:22.40 --> 01:20:25.28
you don't get tired when you do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

793
01:20:25.28 --> 01:20:30.72
well me I mean you know great shape and you know well that's stuff you have made some incredible

794
01:20:30.72 --> 01:20:36.08
strides though on two areas you used to gas out really really bad until until until you start

795
01:20:36.08 --> 01:20:40.96
doing mac cons in your training in your in your non-jutitude training you used to gas out really bad

796
01:20:40.96 --> 01:20:46.64
yeah number one number two used to get really claustrophobic and not be able to handle that yeah

797
01:20:46.64 --> 01:20:50.88
and they were they kind of play out they play off each other I cured you of both those

798
01:20:53.28 --> 01:20:57.04
and sometimes realize you're claustrophobic I was a real like jerk for a while

799
01:20:57.04 --> 01:21:01.36
yeah you're like test time yeah yeah how you let this well there yeah and what's crazy is there's

800
01:21:01.36 --> 01:21:08.24
a third element there is because if you know you gas quick and then you get claustrophobic

801
01:21:08.24 --> 01:21:12.88
now you're that's another enemy the gasing in the claustrophobic that's another enemy so I'm not

802
01:21:12.88 --> 01:21:16.40
just going into you and your kids who are going into gasing claustrophobic so that makes me

803
01:21:16.40 --> 01:21:22.88
even more like anxiety and like you said they're compounding problems because the more tired you get

804
01:21:22.88 --> 01:21:27.04
the worst position you get into now you can't get you out of the panic and you have more tired

805
01:21:27.04 --> 01:21:31.76
yeah and then let that happen one day the next day what what am I scared of now yeah it's just

806
01:21:31.76 --> 01:21:36.32
read it's the swamps of sadness real yeah well you dug your way out of that pretty good I think

807
01:21:36.32 --> 01:21:40.56
the metcon had a lot to do with it you did you just what did you just mentally eventually say like

808
01:21:40.56 --> 01:21:46.24
okay when jacco gets side control on me and holds me there I just need to relax and just sit there

809
01:21:46.24 --> 01:21:50.96
and accept that I'm gonna be here for a little while yeah and a big part of it because sometimes

810
01:21:50.96 --> 01:21:56.96
I'd start to get dizzy like for real claustrophobic it's not just a feeling of oh I'm just so

811
01:21:56.96 --> 01:22:01.28
claustrophobic and that's it it is I think it was like a for real claustrophobic because you start to

812
01:22:01.28 --> 01:22:06.96
get dizzy you know like you're not like you're about to faint but but something like that you know

813
01:22:06.96 --> 01:22:12.000
it was a good decision that's what it's like I want my stupidity train you know I used to get

814
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.72
the guys in train with them all like in a row and I do like 15 minutes of this guy then 15 minutes

815
01:22:16.72 --> 01:22:23.68
of this guy and then 15 and good skill through the potions and and there's one guy and he was super

816
01:22:23.68 --> 01:22:30.08
claustrophobic and he was so mad he'd be you know just get and I'd hold him you know I'd get a

817
01:22:30.08 --> 01:22:36.56
crosshider get the mount and just not let him move put my chest over his face and he would just

818
01:22:36.56 --> 01:22:41.44
you know any he would lose it you know just and and you know take he'd be tapping me like crazy

819
01:22:41.44 --> 01:22:45.76
like there's no submission what he's got from you can't tap on there's no submission to get off

820
01:22:45.76 --> 01:22:50.56
me go off me and then you know finally I'd tap him out and then let him go and he'd be like

821
01:22:50.56 --> 01:22:55.60
you got you got to just stay off me yeah it's so mad he's kind of stop training and that's

822
01:22:55.60 --> 01:23:02.24
the vip prod say I mean if you have like a condit dined it that to me back in the when I had he was

823
01:23:02.24 --> 01:23:09.36
like mounted then I'd be like and on a tap he's like no man that's like man yeah and uh Dean

824
01:23:09.36 --> 01:23:16.40
actually was funny yesterday maybe the yeah as yesterday the the the the the power was going out

825
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:20.88
like momentarily in the gym a few times yeah well before the power started like it was going off

826
01:23:20.88 --> 01:23:27.36
for ten seconds certain light though yeah but so it was killing the clock yes so we were going

827
01:23:27.36 --> 01:23:31.68
when the clock was still running and he was doing that to me right and when he tries to make

828
01:23:31.68 --> 01:23:36.40
me claustrophobic or tries to get reaction out of me I just go into like complete

829
01:23:36.40 --> 01:23:40.88
detachment mental shut down not not mental shut down in a negative way but mental shut down

830
01:23:40.88 --> 01:23:47.28
like okay I'm not gonna show you any yeah and so he's like like basically rut uh putting his

831
01:23:47.28 --> 01:23:52.08
knuckle into my ribbies mounted smothering me and rubbing his knuckle into my rib and I'm just laying

832
01:23:52.08 --> 01:23:56.08
there like taking it and just thinking about other things and and actually I'm thinking like when

833
01:23:56.08 --> 01:24:02.56
I get it on top of your kill him and and then the timer ran out and he kept doing it

834
01:24:03.36 --> 01:24:10.000
and he kept doing it and he kept doing it for like another 30 seconds and then he laughed and he

835
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:20.24
jumped off so then we were going again and I I got him into a got a good position right I got

836
01:24:20.24 --> 01:24:24.32
him in the arm lock and I'm sitting there and he's already finished you know if you don't believe

837
01:24:24.32 --> 01:24:28.88
me go watch him go get John Jay and in Metamores and you know there's John Jay one of the best

838
01:24:28.88 --> 01:24:34.08
you get your practitioners of all time go this one arm lock on Dean can get out of it so I'm going

839
01:24:34.08 --> 01:24:43.76
for an arm lock on Dean and the timer goes like at the end of the round and and and he's like

840
01:24:44.80 --> 01:24:51.12
gear because I didn't let go because I said you violated the GJ2 Geneva Convention on

841
01:24:51.12 --> 01:24:56.88
class for him and he laughed and then let him go but uh this all good and it's kind of what

842
01:24:56.88 --> 01:25:02.56
that is well look at tapping and you don't let go that's the violation of the Geneva Convention

843
01:25:02.56 --> 01:25:10.16
for the GJ2 Convention yeah yeah sure you can't be breaking those laws the Metcon and getting into

844
01:25:10.16 --> 01:25:16.88
condition losing like a little bit of weight or whatever sure it gets in my case it got mean you know

845
01:25:16.88 --> 01:25:22.40
better shape and I can you can go longer less class for him just in general but the the bigger

846
01:25:22.40 --> 01:25:28.16
impact was that that's not something I have to worry about anymore dealing with being and when

847
01:25:28.16 --> 01:25:33.76
I get tired mentally you become you know what it feels like to be tired because I don't get

848
01:25:33.76 --> 01:25:37.68
you know what that felt like before it was hard to deal with I would say that's how it felt

849
01:25:37.68 --> 01:25:42.000
to me like what I'm like I'm tired I need to not be tired that's the goal now I don't care

850
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.16
about getting tapped out anymore it's the tiredness is is really the fight that the demon here not

851
01:25:48.16 --> 01:25:54.24
the tap you know but once you go the Metcon not like I said the Metcon and just muscular conditioning

852
01:25:54.24 --> 01:25:59.20
in general it'll sure it'll get you in shape but since you have to kind of do it all the time

853
01:25:59.20 --> 01:26:04.32
for it to work like in exercise you're used to it that feeling it becomes like common exactly

854
01:26:04.32 --> 01:26:11.60
you're you're mentally anoculated to oh I'm out of breath I'm not you what you used to think

855
01:26:11.60 --> 01:26:17.84
was I'm out of breath and I'm gonna die and I think I'm out of breath and that's okay yeah

856
01:26:17.84 --> 01:26:27.84
I'll recover yes you'll recover in some other position yeah and man it makes you just a way funer

857
01:26:27.84 --> 01:26:33.20
thing and he's going hard and it was like sure you're you know it's a good good workout but

858
01:26:33.20 --> 01:26:38.48
it just makes it way funer for sure but yeah the point is there that's why you can endure tiredness

859
01:26:38.48 --> 01:26:42.16
is when you're having a good time when there's little pass you ever notice even if you don't really

860
01:26:42.16 --> 01:26:46.24
roll that you might be different actually I'm sure you feel this when you go home you feel like

861
01:26:46.24 --> 01:26:51.60
the heat radiating from your body still you know even after you go home you're like dang it really

862
01:26:51.60 --> 01:26:57.52
roll that hard because it doesn't feel like it's that hard because it's so fun you know yeah well

863
01:26:57.52 --> 01:27:04.16
I roll hard every single time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah man it's the the genius behind it

864
01:27:04.16 --> 01:27:12.08
anyway if you want help it's a performance was that just a 14 we have 20 minute talk about on it

we got some time so I'm filling up water you know you're going to be gallons of water

869
01:27:34.56 --> 01:27:39.76
there are five gallons of it so I go fill up I got four of them so I put them in the back of my car

870
01:27:39.76 --> 01:27:45.84
in the back seat yeah so when I bring them from the the water filler thing to my car I'm grabbing

871
01:27:45.84 --> 01:27:50.96
them both and I'm walking across the street you're too ready at four I had four but two at a time

872
01:27:50.96 --> 01:27:55.84
I feel too because it's two right things whatever so therefore I'm walking across street to you know

873
01:27:55.84 --> 01:28:00.08
not the street the parking lot to my car to put them in and I'm like this isn't even hard

874
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:04.96
but they look kind of big you know I'm like this isn't even hard just like I'm not like stiff

875
01:28:04.96 --> 01:28:11.04
and it's not like I'm warmed up ready to get after you know oh my god but then you're walking

876
01:28:11.04 --> 01:28:16.56
there at handle so it shouldn't be that hard for someone my weight and whatever so I get to the

877
01:28:16.56 --> 01:28:22.08
car and I put them in but I'm like hey I need more room to put the other two so I don't just try

878
01:28:22.08 --> 01:28:27.60
to lug a man all perfect for I got a like stretch and put these you know there are five pong

879
01:28:27.60 --> 01:28:30.80
jugs you gotta stretch these awkward position but I did it kind of no problem

01:35:22.32 --> 01:35:28.000
you know discipline equals freedom was all up in there it was good the good and

950
01:35:29.28 --> 01:35:35.04
this one is a big one to support yourself psychological warfare yeah this is literal like support

951
01:35:35.04 --> 01:35:43.20
yes it's like a spot the the feedback from everyone out there on psychological warfare

952
01:35:43.20 --> 01:35:54.64
it's 100 percent of that see but listen to the track sugar coated lies if you listen that

953
01:35:54.64 --> 01:36:01.12
track you could be in crispy cream donuts after not eating for three days and you will go in there

954
01:36:01.12 --> 01:36:07.28
you listen to that track you will not eat a donut you will not well no it's true it's absolutely true

955
01:36:07.28 --> 01:36:12.96
and the wake up thing the wake up thing I was going to say the wake up you will get out of bed

956
01:36:12.96 --> 01:36:19.60
yeah because because you this is the thing you know what's being told to you is true you know

957
01:36:19.60 --> 01:36:25.28
it's true you you part of your brain is saying you know what it's not true yeah I'm just kidding

958
01:36:25.28 --> 01:36:31.76
right now one donuts not gonna kill you actually it is gonna kill you so you're not gonna eat it

959
01:36:31.76 --> 01:36:38.24
yeah so psychological warfare that's a good one by the way I listen to it

960
01:36:39.84 --> 01:36:44.08
joculous in peace yourself some thought you know what's kind of like why do I actually

961
01:36:44.08 --> 01:36:48.56
listen to this now now I listen to it well it could actually in a way be more effective for you

962
01:36:48.56 --> 01:36:54.32
because it's really you talking to yourself truly me yeah it's like you talking to yourself

963
01:36:54.32 --> 01:36:58.40
like your brain it's like the place in your head it's true and this is a good one just like the

964
01:36:58.40 --> 01:37:04.88
real oil and just like the the on it stuff it's not like like get up and get after like it's not

965
01:37:04.88 --> 01:37:10.40
like wait let me explain what it is it's these tracks on an album you can buy from iTunes

966
01:37:11.68 --> 01:37:16.88

these MP3 tracks you can play in your phone before you're about to when you're having moments

968
01:37:22.48 --> 01:37:25.52
a weakness you're gonna skip the workout because you don't feel like it or you're gonna skip

969
01:37:25.52 --> 01:37:30.08
you're gonna mess up your diet because you're too hungry and it looks so delicious right?

970
01:37:30.08 --> 01:37:34.32
or you want to press news on the thing you can put it as your alarm on whatever you buy these

971
01:37:34.32 --> 01:37:39.68
tracks and they're for different situations and it'll give you a little spot we'll say that

972
01:37:39.68 --> 01:37:45.04
jockel will be there to give you a little spot anyway they're mental a mental spot yeah psychological

973
01:37:45.04 --> 01:37:51.20
um psychological they're a little fight the urge to be a slacker crush with it but it's good

974
01:37:51.20 --> 01:37:55.76
because it's not like the get up and get out it scares you out of bed so you'll get out of bed it's not

975
01:37:55.76 --> 01:38:00.88
that no it's like psychological warfare it tells your mind to think the certain way you know so it's

976
01:38:00.88 --> 01:38:06.40
really you're doing it it's like it's not a kinetic strike it's psychological warfare which is actually

977
01:38:06.40 --> 01:38:13.68
more effective yeah because you're doing it it's like the court is on shut versus the cruel we

978
01:38:13.68 --> 01:38:21.84
prefer to let our body do the work yes exactly right and we prefer to let our mind do the work

979
01:38:21.84 --> 01:38:25.52
if you're getting out of bed because someone's yelling out of you okay well that's okay

980
01:38:25.52 --> 01:38:30.000
but it's better if it's you that gets yourself out of bed because you cycle out of school or

981
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.52

1015
01:42:15.92 --> 01:42:19.04
if we don't order it now it's gonna happen the same thing in half of jocca wait to

1016
01:42:19.92 --> 01:42:24.24
the people at a printing is gonna like oh no one's ordering it so we're not going to you know we'll print

1017
01:42:24.24 --> 01:42:29.76
12 copies the day comes out we're gonna get a lot of orders and everyone's gonna have to sit around

1018
01:42:29.76 --> 01:42:33.84
and wait for the thing to be printed so what we want to do is give them the indication that yes

1019
01:42:33.84 --> 01:42:39.52
book is coming out we don't want to end up with jocca white tea style barren arm again on our hands with

1020
01:42:39.52 --> 01:42:48.80
the book and I'll tell you it is you know it's a book it's a kid it's a kid's book admittedly

1021
01:42:49.36 --> 01:42:56.08
but I'm gonna tell you uncle Jake who's in the book who teaches his nephew how to get after it

1022
01:42:56.08 --> 01:43:04.64
uncle Jake's got some lessons for everybody about discipline about working out about overcoming

1023
01:43:04.64 --> 01:43:16.000
fear about diet and exercise and life it's a book about life and

1024
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.08
wait I was right how did you get that I know you're all a third of those got a physical

1025
01:43:20.08 --> 01:43:23.76
copy of physical copy that I'm holding in my hands right now it's called a galley

1026
01:43:23.76 --> 01:43:29.36
give you it's so that you can see and make sure you can go through it and correct it

1027
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:35.12
like a final edit like a final edit and this one's pretty good it's pretty close

1028
01:43:37.12 --> 01:43:41.84
it's a tasty yeah so here we go so at this point here's what's going on

1029
01:43:43.12 --> 01:43:50.88
at this point basically the kid mark he's like I said he doesn't know how to do he can't

1030
01:43:50.88 --> 01:43:56.56
to any pull-ups doesn't know his time stables he's getting picked on its rule doesn't know how to swim

1031
01:43:58.16 --> 01:44:02.80
guess what he's a ten-year-old kid in life life is hard he's realized that he's bummed out he's been

1032
01:44:02.80 --> 01:44:08.32
sad his uncle Jake comes to live with him for the summer his uncle Jake used to be in the

1033
01:44:08.32 --> 01:44:12.72
seal teams he's getting out so he can go to college but during the summer he's living with his sister

1034
01:44:12.72 --> 01:44:21.52
so now when uncle Jake realizes that mark as all these issues like I said what does he say when

1035
01:44:21.52 --> 01:44:27.44
mark freaks out and cries it says like all these issues uncle Jake says good we can solve these

1036
01:44:27.44 --> 01:44:36.72
problems and then he says look you you're not really getting after it do you you need to be

1037
01:44:36.72 --> 01:44:42.24
instead of being this kind of wimpy kid over here you need to be a warrior kid and mark

1038
01:44:42.24 --> 01:44:49.20
sort of what's a warrior kid and so at this point they're they're talking about like do you

1039
01:44:49.20 --> 01:44:58.16
actually know what a warrior is and I'll go back to the book right now so here's uncle Jake do you

1040
01:44:58.16 --> 01:45:06.88
even know what a warrior is? Mark says yes I mean I guess I know a warrior is someone who fights in

1041
01:45:06.88 --> 01:45:15.84
wars right? and uncle Jake says that is one part but what else? I'm not sure what else.

1042
01:45:16.72 --> 01:45:22.80
so do you think that the only way to be a warrior is to fight in wars and do you think that anyone

1043
01:45:22.80 --> 01:45:32.56
who fights in wars is a warrior? I guess so well you guessed wrong there is a lot more to being a

1044
01:45:32.56 --> 01:45:40.40
warrior than just being in a war warriors are people that stand up for themselves they face challenges

1045
01:45:40.40 --> 01:45:46.000
warriors or card to achieve goals they have the discipline to overcome their weaknesses

1046
01:45:47.12 --> 01:45:52.32
warriors are people that constantly try to test and improve themselves and yes

1047
01:45:52.32 --> 01:46:02.16
war is the ultimate test but not all warriors go to war and then Marx says but how can a kid be a warrior?

1048
01:46:04.08 --> 01:46:11.84
and uncle Marx says or uncle Jake says by doing everything I just said a normal kid doesn't push

1049
01:46:11.84 --> 01:46:19.28
himself a warrior kid does a normal kid doesn't work to constantly improve himself a warrior

1050
01:46:19.28 --> 01:46:25.92
kid does I look at all these problems you cried to me about yesterday a warrior kid wouldn't cry

1051
01:46:25.92 --> 01:46:33.28
about those problems a warrior kid would do something about those problems and then Marx says do what

1052
01:46:33.92 --> 01:46:41.36
do what do whatever it takes every problem you have can be overcome every one of them

1053
01:46:42.24 --> 01:46:47.36
you can't do pull-ups you work out and get stronger until you can you don't know your times

1054
01:46:47.36 --> 01:46:54.80
tables you study and train your mind until you know them cold you can't swim you learn how

1055
01:46:55.68 --> 01:47:04.08
you get picked on you learn out of fight fight I asked yes fight just like anything else in the

1056
01:47:04.08 --> 01:47:09.92
world there are techniques to fighting like learning a sport and when you know the techniques and

1057
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:17.20
practice them you can defend yourself from anyone you really think I could learn all that I know you can

1058
01:47:17.92 --> 01:47:24.48
like I told you last night I had to transform myself when I got in the navy I had to get stronger

1059
01:47:24.48 --> 01:47:32.40
I had to learn to fight I even had to learn to learn but I did it and if I did it so can you

1060
01:47:32.40 --> 01:47:46.64
do you want to you want to overcome all these challenges you face of course and then as they

1061
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:51.60
wrap up that conversation they were out in the park when they're doing that and Marx says we

1062
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:58.32
walked through the park and back to the house without saying another word something had already changed

1063
01:47:58.32 --> 01:48:11.44
