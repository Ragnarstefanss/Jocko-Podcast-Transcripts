00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.62
This is Jockel podcast number 190 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening and

2
00:00:08.28 --> 00:00:16.24
Joining us once again is Dave Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening. The last three podcasts

3
00:00:16.96 --> 00:00:18.96
Dave has been on

4
00:00:18.96 --> 00:00:25.84
187188 and 189 and we have been talking about the first six chapters the Marine Corps publication

5
00:00:25.84 --> 00:00:38.80
and called a one-tack three tactics and if you haven't listened to those three podcasts go start with those. You'll hear about Dave Burke and

6
00:00:39.52 --> 00:00:43.84
if you have listened to them then we're gonna continue on today. The last

7
00:00:44.88 --> 00:00:54.88
the last podcast of this series. Hopefully we can make it through the last two chapters chapter seven and eight. Marine Corps first-lutenant

8
00:00:54.88 --> 00:01:10.16
at the basic school time now. Are they listening and getting anything out of this particular series of podcast?

9
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:19.28
Based on the number of messages I get from Lieutenant's TBS just talking about this podcast,

10
00:01:19.28 --> 00:01:25.28
they are listening in a way that and and learning things that I never learned when I was a TBS.

11
00:01:26.72 --> 00:01:34.08
The impact of this on the Marine Corps is huge because the fact that I listened to this stuff and looking at this manual totally

12
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:43.68
differently than I did 25 years ago. There's just a different way to observe things through a different lens

13
00:01:43.68 --> 00:01:49.76
than your own and and when you're young hey man and listen any of those any

14
00:01:50.56 --> 00:01:57.04
first-lutenant at TBS right now I will trade places with you immediately. If I can do that I will

15
00:01:57.84 --> 00:02:03.84
trade places with you right now. I will I would give anything to be in that position. But

16
00:02:05.52 --> 00:02:12.72
so it's so so I'm not trying to disparage your situation in life. What I'm saying is when you're seeing this

17
00:02:12.72 --> 00:02:19.76
for the first time and you're 21 years old you just don't have the the breadth of experience to go oh

18
00:02:19.76 --> 00:02:24.72
I can I can relate to that and for me that's what learning is and I've complained about this before in

19
00:02:24.72 --> 00:02:31.52
schools in all schools. Every subject that you learn in school should be tied with the thread to

20
00:02:31.52 --> 00:02:36.24
every other subject that you learn in school because it is because everything that you learn about is

21
00:02:36.24 --> 00:02:42.80
tied to everything else. That's that that's the way it is. The science, the art, the literature, they're all

22
00:02:42.80 --> 00:02:50.88
into woven through history, through mankind and so what happens is if you can tie those threads together

23
00:02:50.88 --> 00:02:55.92
then you get a better understanding of what is actually what you're being taught. So what I like

24
00:02:55.92 --> 00:03:01.68
and what why I appreciate the fact that the young military person now whether in the ring or whatever

25
00:03:01.68 --> 00:03:08.88
service they're in they can take what your experiences is Dave what my experience and we can weave

26
00:03:08.88 --> 00:03:16.000
some other aspects of this information in so that so that people including me get a better

27
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.32
understanding of of this knowledge because the knowledge is there. I mean the knowledge is there,

28
00:03:22.32 --> 00:03:34.16
the framework is there and I'll get to a point where I make a critique of this manual and the

29
00:03:34.16 --> 00:03:39.36
critique of this manual that I make is it's there's a level of simplicity one that they could

30
00:03:39.36 --> 00:03:43.44
make things a little bit clear and a little bit more simple a couple times. There's sometimes

31
00:03:43.44 --> 00:03:46.80
where I think it could be a little bit simpler and a little bit a little bit simpler a little bit

32
00:03:46.80 --> 00:03:50.88
a little bit simpler a little bit more straightforward to be honest with you that's what I think

33
00:03:50.88 --> 00:03:56.32
cover move simple prioritize next to you and decentralized command that is like the the based

34
00:03:56.32 --> 00:04:06.32
level of hey man this is what you need and then this all just builds so so perfectly on upon that

35
00:04:06.32 --> 00:04:13.12
and of course there's that's like one situation there's the other 80 the other 98% of this is where

36
00:04:13.12 --> 00:04:18.64
I look at it go yeah they wrote this way better than I ever could have then Dave then you

37
00:04:18.64 --> 00:04:23.28
ever like we just don't have and that's that's why even when I said the last podcast like I

38
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:28.80
know there was there had to be one guy that was like overseeing this but the group of people that put

39
00:04:28.80 --> 00:04:34.48
this thing together they were good at what they did and they did a great job doing this so

40
00:04:35.68 --> 00:04:43.36
I'm glad to be able to talk about it I'm glad to be able to learn from it and it's amazing because

41
00:04:43.36 --> 00:04:49.92
I don't remember when I read this for the first time I don't know I know that and I was telling

42
00:04:49.92 --> 00:04:55.84
you this earlier Dave when I came back and wrote down the laws of combat for the first time those were

43
00:04:57.44 --> 00:05:04.64
look I absolutely I know I played jrized them from various places but they were

44
00:05:06.40 --> 00:05:12.40
but I didn't I didn't say oh this this comes from here cover move I know where I learned

45
00:05:12.40 --> 00:05:15.52
that from for the first time I learned it from Roger Hayden it's actually the first time I learned I was like

46
00:05:15.52 --> 00:05:19.36
oh okay well that's the first time I put it together I heard it before that's the first time I said oh that's

47
00:05:19.36 --> 00:05:25.84
what that actually means the simple thing kind of the same thing you know some of those old Vietnam guys

48
00:05:25.84 --> 00:05:32.56
you go to keep things simple you know prioritizing execute that's I had to put a word that I had to

49
00:05:32.56 --> 00:05:38.48
put words to that because I didn't have I'd never before I wrote that down I had never told anyone to

50
00:05:38.48 --> 00:05:42.80
do those things I said it in a million different ways I had to said it in a million different ways but I

51
00:05:42.80 --> 00:05:47.84
never said okay this is prioritizing actually that's what you need to do decentralized command obviously

52
00:05:47.84 --> 00:05:55.04
people been saying that for a really long time but for me the first time I wrote them down

53
00:05:55.84 --> 00:06:01.04
was when we got back from Ramadi and I didn't like I said I knew that I kind of plagiarized them

54
00:06:01.04 --> 00:06:08.32
but at the same time I couldn't point to the sources right I couldn't say oh yeah I took this

55
00:06:08.32 --> 00:06:14.000
from here I took that from here I couldn't it was a bunch of information that was in my head that it

56
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.32
had been fermenting for a long period of time and then when I realized I had to teach this stuff I

57
00:06:20.32 --> 00:06:26.80
I needed to write it down in a distilled manner so so then and I was telling this this is the

58
00:06:26.80 --> 00:06:31.12
getting to the part that I was telling you I was telling you that once I wrote these four laws I was

59
00:06:31.12 --> 00:06:37.92
kind of like a little bit paranoid because here I am you know getting up on a pedestal and saying

60
00:06:37.92 --> 00:06:43.20
here's the laws of combat which is a really arrogant like statement to make right

61
00:06:43.92 --> 00:06:51.44
to say oh I've written the laws of combat like no like that's not what I'm saying and I

62
00:06:51.44 --> 00:06:58.72
questioned as I started putting them out to guys I started questioning okay how universities are these

63
00:06:58.72 --> 00:07:03.12
the right ways this is the right way to go is this the right thing to think about have I captured

64
00:07:03.12 --> 00:07:08.48
these correctly and one of the ones that I was most concerned about oddly enough because it's the

65
00:07:08.48 --> 00:07:13.04
most obvious one was simple was keeping things simple and and part of that reason was because

66
00:07:13.84 --> 00:07:20.80
man the planning had gotten so completely crazy and out of control in the seal teams and in the

67
00:07:20.80 --> 00:07:30.40
whole US military the 96 hour planning cycle it had just gone completely buck wild crazy and I as

68
00:07:30.40 --> 00:07:36.88
a being raised that way in the seal teams I had I was a little nervous about saying to myself look

69
00:07:36.88 --> 00:07:43.68
hey I've been told about all this detailed planning for the last 15 years 16 years 17 years

70
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:49.12
of my life and now I'm saying no what you're going to do is keep it simple and so I started

71
00:07:49.12 --> 00:07:55.28
reading through some of these manuals that I had skimmed through that I had looked through that I had

72
00:07:55.68 --> 00:08:01.68
that I had looked down on if you showed me this manual if I read this manual when I was in E5

73
00:08:01.68 --> 00:08:07.92
and the teams are been like oh whatever man I'm in the teams you know that's I'm just being straight

74
00:08:07.92 --> 00:08:12.08
up that's what my attitude would have been as I started so so then when I refer back to them

75
00:08:12.08 --> 00:08:17.04
and I started going okay let me confirm some of what I'm saying and when I start with the so the

76
00:08:17.04 --> 00:08:21.12
first one that I really looked at was simple because I felt like oh I'm telling guys to be simple

77
00:08:21.12 --> 00:08:28.16
but is that really the right answer and I found that keeping things simple is a military maximum

78
00:08:28.16 --> 00:08:35.52
of war that has been around since the beginning of war since the beginning of war they've been

79
00:08:35.52 --> 00:08:42.88
saying hey dumbass you gotta keep things simple and then from there I continued to read these

80
00:08:42.88 --> 00:08:49.52
different perspectives these different manuals these different historical documents and just

81
00:08:49.52 --> 00:08:56.88
the same things just get repeated over and over and over again and that's that's why when you

82
00:08:56.88 --> 00:09:01.84
hear it from a different angle a different perspective and especially when that's this clearly written

83
00:09:03.36 --> 00:09:08.96
it's like yes this makes absolutely sense so when I say there's a little critique I want to make

84
00:09:08.96 --> 00:09:17.44
do I trust me I am not making a critique of like hey listen to me I know all of them saying is like

85
00:09:18.16 --> 00:09:22.32
I guess what I'm saying is this is where I think it fits together this is where I think

86
00:09:22.88 --> 00:09:29.60
you know being able to explain something to people from a different just a slightly different angle

87
00:09:29.60 --> 00:09:33.52
it's beneficial and there's be plenty of people that will go well you know jocquoise points okay

88
00:09:33.52 --> 00:09:37.68
but the Marine Corps tactic thing the Marine Corps manual explains it better and there's some

89
00:09:37.68 --> 00:09:41.84
people that will say oh you know the Marine Corps tactics thing makes sense but I actually

90
00:09:41.84 --> 00:09:49.12
received it better when I heard Dave say this or I heard jocquoise say that like that's so so

91
00:09:49.12 --> 00:09:55.84
when you take these things and you pars them and you look at them and you look at them from your

92
00:09:55.84 --> 00:10:01.44
viewpoint from my viewpoint all it does all it does is gives people a better understanding and

93
00:10:01.44 --> 00:10:05.68
what that understanding does is it gives you the ability to recognize these patterns and more

94
00:10:05.68 --> 00:10:15.68
in different places if you've got the humility to recognize that that point of view exists in a

95
00:10:15.68 --> 00:10:22.48
whole bunch of different places I read extreme ownership at the end of my career at the tail end

96
00:10:22.48 --> 00:10:28.80
of my career and what I learned from that at the time was significant but more importantly I've

97
00:10:28.80 --> 00:10:34.96
gone back and re-read that and seeing different things in it and I think the key more than anything is

98
00:10:34.96 --> 00:10:40.96
it actually doesn't matter which of those ones speak to you the right way it's the recognition

99
00:10:40.96 --> 00:10:46.40
that and it goes back to when you know the way broadly you see it and all things if the ability

100
00:10:46.40 --> 00:10:51.52
to to see something and read something and have that teach you something that you no matter

101
00:10:51.52 --> 00:10:54.56
how long you've been doing it whether you're a second attend to the Bayes League school or a

102
00:10:54.56 --> 00:10:59.20
colonel in the Marine Corps that you will find these lessons in these different perspectives in a

103
00:10:59.20 --> 00:11:04.24
whole bunch of different places and what required is the humility to recognize that you're going to

104
00:11:04.24 --> 00:11:09.04
learn things from a different perspective and if you keep an open mind when you're reading this stuff

105
00:11:09.04 --> 00:11:13.04
you'll go back if you're at Lieutenant at TBS you're going to read this one three and five years

106
00:11:13.04 --> 00:11:17.28
and it's going to say totally different things to you if you go in with that mindset of

107
00:11:17.28 --> 00:11:22.32
you're going to take something away from it different than the first time yeah and you know we

108
00:11:22.32 --> 00:11:28.16
talked about on the last podcast getting reps in right getting reps in you know in whether it's

109
00:11:28.16 --> 00:11:33.44
training whether it's you in an airplane maneuvering around the sky against an enemy with a wingman

110
00:11:33.44 --> 00:11:41.20
whatever you get reps in and you get reps in doing immediate action drills out in the desert or

111
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:46.000
an urban environment you get reps in and then as a leader you get the reps in of oh here's

112
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.56
something I don't recognize how can I put my recognition over what I'm looking at and how can I

113
00:11:50.56 --> 00:11:55.92
make a good decision you get reps in and the more reps you get in the better you get as you go

114
00:11:55.92 --> 00:12:00.000
through tactics and you start to think about it and you start to pick them apart and you start to

115
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.44
hear them from different angles it's a rep and every rep you get makes you a little tiny bit better

116
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.52
so when I hear the Marine Corps tactics manual talking about cooperation and I've been talking

117
00:12:15.52 --> 00:12:23.92
about cover move consistently for for a long time let me thank for 12 years 13 years I've been

118
00:12:23.92 --> 00:12:30.56
talking about cover move and yet they come in they call it cooperation it's the same thing but

119
00:12:30.56 --> 00:12:39.20
guess what I know it better now I have just a little bit more now I understand it I now understand

120
00:12:39.20 --> 00:12:44.64
cover move as cooperation and that's actually the way I describe it as I say cover move is teamwork

121
00:12:44.64 --> 00:12:49.76
they say cooperation is teamwork guess what same thing little bit different angle I now have a

122
00:12:49.76 --> 00:12:56.000
better understanding of it and that means I'm going to be able to recognize it in different places

123
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.40
it where I might not have I might have seen it in 94 places out of 100 now on now maybe I'll see

124
00:13:02.40 --> 00:13:10.56
it in 96 maybe I'll see it 95 but I'll see it better I'll see it more clearly so no matter where you are

125
00:13:11.20 --> 00:13:16.88
in your on on the path no matter where you are on the path you're gonna you're gonna see more

126
00:13:16.88 --> 00:13:23.36
and this is something life and I've talked about we like the first master or no we didn't

127
00:13:23.36 --> 00:13:29.20
event with someone and then they came to the master and they said oh I really liked the way you

128
00:13:29.20 --> 00:13:37.04
changed the the the the laws of combat and life's like we didn't change we haven't changed anything

129
00:13:37.04 --> 00:13:43.04
doesn't matter fact this the slides that you saw are the same slides that you saw when you

130
00:13:43.04 --> 00:13:48.16
came to when we came to your company two and a half years ago or whatever but to your point

131
00:13:48.16 --> 00:13:52.96
what happened to that individuals his perspective change we didn't change but you're but that

132
00:13:52.96 --> 00:13:58.08
individuals perspective changes and that's what you know I always talk about the fact that Mike

133
00:13:58.08 --> 00:14:02.32
Cerrellie when Mike Cerrellie took over the junior officer course from life and I was going in there

134
00:14:02.96 --> 00:14:09.12
with each class and going through the laws of combat brief and on the ninth time I taught it

135
00:14:09.12 --> 00:14:14.08
when Mike Cerrellie was running hit and he pulls up a chair in the back and sits down with his

136
00:14:14.08 --> 00:14:22.40
notebook and I'm like bro you can sit through this again and he's like yeah and I said why

137
00:14:22.40 --> 00:14:28.08
Nigos because I learned something new every time and you know you talk about this a lot you

138
00:14:28.08 --> 00:14:35.92
talk about the fact that clients need repetition yeah and how often how often do you teach somebody

139
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:46.24
about cover move or simple and they go oh cool god it it just doesn't happen no it doesn't and

140
00:14:47.12 --> 00:14:54.72
it doesn't happen for any of us and even if you do get it something sinks in it only sinks in a

141
00:14:54.72 --> 00:14:59.20
little bit and then you've got a nut and this is it's not just so you see to the note you can

142
00:14:59.20 --> 00:15:03.92
actually teach it different it's another way to explain the exact same thing knowing that the people

143
00:15:03.92 --> 00:15:07.92
working with you some will understand it when they see it this way some will understand it when they

144
00:15:07.92 --> 00:15:13.28
see it that that way and the more different ways you can explain it the quicker they learn to see it

145
00:15:13.28 --> 00:15:17.84
in all of the places that actually will help it really sink in I don't care who you are

146
00:15:18.56 --> 00:15:24.56
me included none of it sinks in the first time and even when it does sink in it's not the whole thing

147
00:15:25.60 --> 00:15:33.76
and to take this one step further so Jimmy Page my favorite I guess my favorite example of this

148
00:15:33.76 --> 00:15:40.96
is Jimmy Page the guitarist from Led Zeppelin arguably the the greatest rock and roll guitarist

149
00:15:40.96 --> 00:15:49.20
of all time who is incredibly beyond comprehension creative with that instrument the guitar

150
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.56
the guitar the get box he was so creative but he was a studio musician for many many years and he was

151
00:15:58.56 --> 00:16:05.44
one of the best studio musicians in London which is no no small feet because London is a music town

152
00:16:06.48 --> 00:16:11.52
so he had this and when you're a studio musician you play the notes that they tell you to play

153
00:16:11.52 --> 00:16:17.60
then you play them how you how they're written on the page that is 100% discipline follow orders

154
00:16:17.60 --> 00:16:24.88
you do what you're told and then guess what once you have that those standard operating procedures

155
00:16:24.88 --> 00:16:29.04
down then you can take them and you you can get creative and you see the patterns where you know

156
00:16:29.04 --> 00:16:35.60
what else sees them so the same thing the same exact thing happens with the laws of combat the

157
00:16:35.60 --> 00:16:41.76
better you know them the better you can take and you can get creative you can creatively apply them

158
00:16:43.44 --> 00:16:50.40
to problems and and they overlay properly on those problems because you understand how to use

159
00:16:50.40 --> 00:16:56.64
them better so I mean I find that on the time we've been working for a long time or

160
00:16:56.64 --> 00:17:02.64
a client set of you know people that read the read the book ten times read read dichotomy

161
00:17:02.64 --> 00:17:07.84
leadership fourteen times they've listened to every single podcast and they'll be presented with

162
00:17:07.84 --> 00:17:14.40
a problem at their job and and the first thing they do is blame someone the first thing they do

163
00:17:14.40 --> 00:17:21.68
is is make a really complex solution it's like it's hard to do now and in different people

164
00:17:21.68 --> 00:17:27.04
learn a different rates because we've got clients I've got clients that could easily teach teach

165
00:17:27.04 --> 00:17:32.24
classes for echelon front because they're so good and their businesses doing great because they've

166
00:17:32.24 --> 00:17:38.32
come so far and they've absorbed so well and I will tell you right now the comment trait that

167
00:17:38.32 --> 00:17:46.000
every single one of those those high level upliers of the laws of combat to their business

168
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.68
everything one of them is like the most horrible incredibly humble human that is like oh yeah

169
00:17:52.32 --> 00:17:56.64
oh well you know I went to this school and I've been doing this for this long yeah and it doesn't

170
00:17:56.64 --> 00:18:04.16
matter because I know I'm not a good leader and I'm gonna get better at it so that's the way to kick it off

171
00:18:04.16 --> 00:18:16.32
now don't go into the book one tack three tactics one on chapter seven chapter seven is called

172
00:18:16.72 --> 00:18:25.36
exploiting success and finishing here's some quotes it starts off with do not delay in the attack

173
00:18:25.36 --> 00:18:30.88
when the foe has been split off and cut down pursue him immediately and give him no time to assemble

174
00:18:30.88 --> 00:18:39.12
or form up spare nothing without regard for difficulties pursue the enemy day and night until he

175
00:18:39.12 --> 00:18:51.84
has been annihilated that's field marshal prince Alexander V suvar off who is a Russian general

176
00:18:52.48 --> 00:18:57.92
who fought against the Ottoman Empire who fought in the against the Polish uprising

177
00:18:57.92 --> 00:19:03.44
who fought in the Italian campaign the Italian campaign which was actually not a war against the

178
00:19:03.44 --> 00:19:08.48
Italian to his award against the French it was a war against Napoleon's army he never actually

179
00:19:08.48 --> 00:19:12.64
came face to face with Napoleon but he fought him and did very very well and that's where this

180
00:19:12.64 --> 00:19:20.24
next little quote comes from it says pursue the last man to the adda and throw the remains into the

181
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:30.40
river same same guy field marshal suvar off and that's what he's talking about they fight in the

182
00:19:30.40 --> 00:19:38.56
French in Italy and what you do you presume to the adda river and then you once you've killed them

183
00:19:38.56 --> 00:19:43.92
you huck their remains into the river that's the level of finishing that we're talking about

184
00:19:43.92 --> 00:19:51.44
and then the last quote that they kicked us off is when we have incurred the risk of a battle

185
00:19:52.08 --> 00:19:56.96
we should know how to profit by the victory and not merely content ourselves according to

186
00:19:56.96 --> 00:20:05.36
custom with possession of the field hey just get in the field isn't good enough that's not good

187
00:20:05.36 --> 00:20:11.12
enough don't don't don't accept that and that's marista sacks who we've covered on this podcast podcast

188
00:20:11.12 --> 00:20:20.24
number one ten revaries on the arch of war disacks was a German soldier he was a he was a leader in the

189
00:20:20.24 --> 00:20:27.28
army the holy row roman empire and he ended up being one of the lead generals of France so

190
00:20:29.28 --> 00:20:34.80
nose what he's talking about and what he's talking about is just because you won the field not good enough

191
00:20:34.80 --> 00:20:42.48
keep going and here's how the marine corpus it it is not enough merely to gain advantage the

192
00:20:42.48 --> 00:20:46.80
enemy will not surrender simply because he is placed at a disadvantage the successful leader

193
00:20:46.80 --> 00:20:54.24
exploits any advantage aggressively and ruthlessly not once but repeatedly until the opportunity

194
00:20:54.24 --> 00:20:56.56
arises for a finishing stroke.

195
00:20:56.56 --> 00:21:06.96
Can we just stop the podcast there the successful leader exploits any advantage aggressively and

196
00:21:06.96 --> 00:21:13.20
ruthlessly not once but repeatedly until the opportunity arises for a finishing stroke.

197
00:21:15.12 --> 00:21:22.08
Yeah we must always be on the lookout for such opportunities whether we create them in

198
00:21:22.08 --> 00:21:27.12
whether we create them ourselves or they arise in the flow of action and when we perceive an

199
00:21:27.12 --> 00:21:35.12
opportunity to be decisive we must seize it. The application of marine cortex does not mean

200
00:21:35.12 --> 00:21:40.48
that we expect to win effortlessly or bloodlessly or that we expect the enemy to collapse just

201
00:21:40.48 --> 00:21:46.24
because we outmaneuver him it means we look for and make the most of every advantage and apply the

202
00:21:46.24 --> 00:21:53.84
decisive stroke when the opportunity presents itself. Building on the advantage once we have gained

203
00:21:53.84 --> 00:22:01.04
the advantage we exploit it we use it to create new opportunities we then exploit those opportunities

204
00:22:01.04 --> 00:22:08.72
to create others shaping the flow of action to our advantage this is so much jujitsu it's ridiculous

205
00:22:08.72 --> 00:22:17.44
I mean it's so much everything but the direct correlation to jujitsu is just crazy. Even small

206
00:22:17.44 --> 00:22:23.44
favoring circumstances exploited repeatedly and aggressively can quickly multiply into decisive

207
00:22:23.44 --> 00:22:30.48
advantages this is when you're rolling with Dean Lister and you give him part of one quarter of an

208
00:22:30.48 --> 00:22:36.08
inch of arm position and he gets it and you think well you know that no big deal it's just a

209
00:22:36.08 --> 00:22:42.64
quarter of an inch in arm position and then he exploits that small circumstance repeatedly

210
00:22:42.64 --> 00:22:47.76
and aggressively until he's got your arm he's ripping it off your body that's what I'm talking about

211
00:22:49.44 --> 00:22:55.20
we'll back to the book like the chess grandmaster we must think ahead to our next move and one beyond it

212
00:22:58.24 --> 00:23:04.08
how am I going to use this advantage to create another one for example and attack by penetration

213
00:23:04.08 --> 00:23:08.40
once we have created one advantage by punching through the enemy's position and getting to his

214
00:23:08.40 --> 00:23:15.04
rear we create another by pouring forces through the gap generating the expanding torrent

215
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:25.92
that ladel heart root about you keep going relentless attack yeah and those those windows those

216
00:23:25.92 --> 00:23:32.64
opportunities not only are they fleeting like those are going to be seconds sometimes that that

217
00:23:32.64 --> 00:23:36.56
opportunity is actually there before he figures out a way to prevent that from happening

218
00:23:37.60 --> 00:23:41.44
all the other resources that you need to bring to bear for that have to be ready to go

219
00:23:42.24 --> 00:23:45.20
so these things that they're describing as simple as they're described look for an opportunity

220
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:51.52
those windows are really really small and when you see them you might get one in an entire fight

221
00:23:51.52 --> 00:23:56.96
you might get one maybe two you have to have all those other things that you need to win

222
00:23:56.96 --> 00:24:04.72
ready to go and fill that unrelenting until the end they are making they're describing a very

223
00:24:04.72 --> 00:24:12.48
simple way but man that is to see that and exploit that to the finish yeah and I'm not

224
00:24:13.68 --> 00:24:19.76
to me sometimes the the people will talk about like how the importance of mindset right

225
00:24:19.76 --> 00:24:26.48
this is one of those things what you just said is like you have to have the mindset

226
00:24:27.36 --> 00:24:34.32
pre prior to the opening happening you have to be thinking as soon as I see this I am going

227
00:24:35.44 --> 00:24:40.32
and if you don't have that the split second that it takes you to look at it and go wait I think that's

228
00:24:40.32 --> 00:24:51.36
an opening I think I should go the the opuscon so having that proactive and pre-existing mentality

229
00:24:51.36 --> 00:24:58.56
of when I see this I'm going you see kids wrestling and shooting takedowns like that's what

230
00:24:58.56 --> 00:25:04.88
they're doing they are so pre-plan to once they do that set up and that that counter starts to take

231
00:25:04.88 --> 00:25:09.36
place and they see that boom they're in there there's no thought process going and if you think

232
00:25:09.36 --> 00:25:21.92
about it for one millisecond that opportunity to run. Ramo recounts how exploiting each advantage in

233
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:31.12
the battle for cook in the Carpathian mountains during World War I led to another opportunity

234
00:25:31.12 --> 00:25:36.32
as his detachment exploited each situation and moved further behind enemy lines it generated

235
00:25:36.32 --> 00:25:41.68
more surprise and advantage during this action during this action rommel detachment captured

236
00:25:41.68 --> 00:25:48.24
thousands of enemy soldiers with very little fighting do largely to his unwillingness to lose momentum

237
00:25:49.28 --> 00:25:54.24
one success led directly to another opportunity which he sees immediately and that's from

238
00:25:54.24 --> 00:25:59.84
that's from rommel's book attacks infantry attacks which is a great book we haven't covered on here yet

239
00:25:59.84 --> 00:26:07.60
it's super tactical it is super tactical it is like talking about where to maneuver squads it's

240
00:26:07.60 --> 00:26:15.12
that tactical what's good about it when I covered on the podcast every section in that book has

241
00:26:16.08 --> 00:26:23.84
a little um a little italicized last three four paragraphs that explain what just happened like

242
00:26:23.84 --> 00:26:31.04
hey here's it's it's not quite like a full lessons learned it's not quite hey here's the let take away

243
00:26:31.04 --> 00:26:36.32
from this but it but some of them are pretty close so when I covered attacks infantry attacks

244
00:26:36.32 --> 00:26:41.92
on here probably do that but that's what we're talking about I'm not gonna slow down I'm not gonna stop

245
00:26:43.92 --> 00:26:49.28
the people and we work with companies and they have these really good business leaders that

246
00:26:49.28 --> 00:26:54.96
we're working with CEOs and guys are just in the game that's how they are that's how they are everywhere

247
00:26:54.96 --> 00:27:00.40
in their life everything in their life is like they are always looking everywhere in life for those

248
00:27:00.40 --> 00:27:07.36
little fleeting opportunities and they are so they are so triggered and ready to attack those positions

249
00:27:07.36 --> 00:27:13.20
when they reveal themselves it's and you talk about the mindset it when you see it done it impermeates

250
00:27:13.20 --> 00:27:18.32
all aspects of people's lives and they look for those windows everywhere and it's something you

251
00:27:18.32 --> 00:27:25.36
actually have to you don't want to look back on your life and think of all the times that you missed

252
00:27:25.36 --> 00:27:31.44
to attack whatever opportunity was there and think about how often that happens but just think

253
00:27:31.44 --> 00:27:35.28
about the guys that we work with the ones that are really good it's not just it work and they're

254
00:27:35.28 --> 00:27:43.20
like some different person it's like that all the time yeah and obviously what can we screw up here

255
00:27:43.20 --> 00:27:49.60
we can attack every old every soon that we see that's the dichotomy so the more experienced you

256
00:27:49.60 --> 00:27:56.96
are as a leader the better you can the better you can see the pattern recognition then you recognize

257
00:27:56.96 --> 00:28:01.52
what opportunities are good and what somebody asked me this the other day like you what

258
00:28:01.52 --> 00:28:05.84
opportunity how do you sort through all these opportunities you know and for me I definitely mean

259
00:28:05.84 --> 00:28:10.96
I get a lot of opportunities and which ones am I gonna invest time into what's the and here's

260
00:28:10.96 --> 00:28:14.80
here's what the answer is do they answer that question is okay how much investment is it

261
00:28:14.80 --> 00:28:18.96
going to take from me time wise because I don't have enough time to do everything that I want to do

262
00:28:18.96 --> 00:28:25.36
it makes me mad but I don't and so and then what's the return on investment going to be how is

263
00:28:25.36 --> 00:28:33.12
it interact and support every other thing that I've got going on because I'm not going to go and

264
00:28:33.12 --> 00:28:39.76
start some venture that's outside that doesn't positively support everything else that I'm doing

265
00:28:39.76 --> 00:28:44.48
yeah the pieces that fit in it everything else had made everything else better those are the ones

266
00:28:44.48 --> 00:28:51.76
that you have to attack on the ones that fit in everywhere else in your life yeah after the bought battle

267
00:28:51.76 --> 00:28:58.08
for Tahrua in November 1943 major Henry Crow commanding officer of second battalion in

268
00:28:58.08 --> 00:29:02.96
eighth Marines was asked why he thought the Japanese had been defeated so quickly once the Marines

269
00:29:02.96 --> 00:29:07.84
were established ashore he remarked that it was due to the constant pressure of naval gunfire

270
00:29:07.84 --> 00:29:14.48
bombs and mortars the Marines used their advantage in supporting arms to create opportunities for

271
00:29:14.48 --> 00:29:21.92
success that pressure put in that pressure on when you put the pressure on that's what creates

272
00:29:21.92 --> 00:29:28.000
the opportunity that's what you feel at one of the jitzie all day long and he was working me over

273
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:37.04
on the mat yesterday constant pressure constant attack it was me just trying to fill in the gaps

274
00:29:37.04 --> 00:29:43.20
as they were opening up and how long can you fill in the gaps for you can't do it indefinitely

275
00:29:43.20 --> 00:29:46.72
because when you're filling in one gap guess what's happening another gap is opening up

276
00:29:47.52 --> 00:29:50.80
that's you got to be careful that that's going back to what we just talked about like if you

277
00:29:50.80 --> 00:29:56.72
try and fill gaps that don't that aren't good opportunities you're leaving other areas exposed

278
00:29:56.72 --> 00:30:04.64
and that's going to be a negative next section's called consolidation exploitation and pursuit

279
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:11.52
once we have created leverage how do we take full advantage of it a decisive result or victory

280
00:30:11.52 --> 00:30:17.28
rarely stems from the initial action no matter how successful more often victories are the

281
00:30:17.28 --> 00:30:22.88
result of aggressively exploiting some relative advantage until one becomes decisive and the

282
00:30:22.88 --> 00:30:31.12
action turns into a route victories are the result of aggressively exploiting some relative advantage

283
00:30:31.12 --> 00:30:38.80
until one becomes decisive casually rates historically tend to remain constant and often

284
00:30:38.80 --> 00:30:46.72
fairly even until one side or the other tries to flee only then do significantly asymmetrical

285
00:30:46.72 --> 00:30:52.24
casualty rates commonly occur this exploitation of the enemy's bad situation can yield

286
00:30:52.24 --> 00:31:01.76
surprisingly great results we can take several specific types of actions to exploit opportunities

287
00:31:01.76 --> 00:31:06.64
we have created or discovered the first way we can exploit successes by consolidation

288
00:31:07.60 --> 00:31:12.96
as we consolidate our forces after seizing a position we intend to hold against the enemy here

289
00:31:12.96 --> 00:31:18.16
our aims are limited to protecting what we have already gained we must realize that by consolidating

290
00:31:18.16 --> 00:31:23.60
rather than continuing to force the issue we may be surrendering the initiative let's talk about

291
00:31:23.60 --> 00:31:31.60
holding position there are there may be any number of reasons for choosing this course perhaps

292
00:31:31.60 --> 00:31:37.04
we lack the strength to continue to advance our new gain may be maybe of critical importance

293
00:31:37.04 --> 00:31:41.28
and the risk of losing it out ways the advantages of any further gains perhaps the new gain

294
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:46.88
itself grants a significant advantage for instance a position that provides excellent fires

295
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:53.60
or threatens the enemy lines of communications may put the enemy in an untenable position perhaps

296
00:31:54.16 --> 00:31:59.28
the new gain compels the enemy to meet us on our terms for example we see as a critical piece of

297
00:31:59.28 --> 00:32:05.36
terrain with strong defensive qualities forcing the enemy to attack on unfavorable terms so

298
00:32:05.36 --> 00:32:10.96
there are times where you hold position where there are times when you strong boy you

299
00:32:10.96 --> 00:32:17.84
consolidate your forces you get everyone together you you you dig in there are absolutely times to

300
00:32:17.84 --> 00:32:24.80
do that and they say and if you do that too long that can stifle the the initiative and

301
00:32:24.80 --> 00:32:29.68
and I need I think about this sometimes is that and I I need to be more careful sometimes and

302
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:34.96
I think about this even with clients that I work with every time I say something I know that

303
00:32:34.96 --> 00:32:39.20
there's a dichotomy to what I'm saying that there is no absolute and I sometimes forget to say

304
00:32:39.20 --> 00:32:46.80
and if you push too aggressively you can get to spread out every everything that's being said here and all

305
00:32:46.80 --> 00:32:53.36
the conversations we're having make by definition there is a dichotomy and all that you can go too far

306
00:32:53.36 --> 00:32:57.44
in any of these directions so as you read this and listen to these things and even the things that I say

307
00:32:58.16 --> 00:33:02.08
we don't always talk about what the dichotomy is but that's a perfect example hey we can

308
00:33:02.08 --> 00:33:06.96
consolidate that might be the right thing to do but if we do that too much we lose the advantage we

309
00:33:06.96 --> 00:33:11.76
have of how fast I would or our our tempo is and if we're too aggressive and get too spread out

310
00:33:11.76 --> 00:33:16.88
too thinned out down the line then that could be a problem too there's a dichotomy in every

311
00:33:16.88 --> 00:33:21.84
action that we can take as a leader and I know that in my head and I don't always articulate and say

312
00:33:21.84 --> 00:33:26.32
that but that's the way we should think in all the movements no matter how aggressive we're going to be

313
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:31.92
to remember you can overdo all of this stuff yeah well that's one of the reasons we we wrote

314
00:33:31.92 --> 00:33:37.20
that dichotomy of leadership is because and when I first started talking about the dichotomy of leadership I

315
00:33:37.20 --> 00:33:44.000
would say it was because a lot of questions we got were about the dichotomy of leadership but the

316
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
real reason we wrote it's because the answers are about the dichotomy of leadership yes and every

317
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.08
and it's a it's a and and I talked about this already on this series upon cast that that

318
00:33:56.08 --> 00:34:05.92
the reason one of the things that brought the dichotomy of leadership to my brain was the fact that

319
00:34:05.92 --> 00:34:11.68
what was was I had to admit that I was wrong I had to say you know what being aggressive be

320
00:34:11.68 --> 00:34:18.24
aggressive be aggressive be aggressive and and then I realized that can be wrong oh you can be too

321
00:34:18.24 --> 00:34:23.04
aggressive yes you can oh you can strong point of building too long and that was something we'd

322
00:34:23.04 --> 00:34:27.92
see all the time in training was we'd we'd be attacking guys in an urban environment they would do the

323
00:34:27.92 --> 00:34:33.36
right thing in strong point of building and if they got bogged down in that building then they

324
00:34:33.36 --> 00:34:37.84
would get surrounded and they get picked off and they'd get slaughtered if they strong pointed that

325
00:34:37.84 --> 00:34:44.48
building they made a quick rapid plan on how they were going to break out of there they would do

326
00:34:44.48 --> 00:34:57.12
fine so they had to find that they had to find that balance the second way to pursue an advantage

327
00:34:57.76 --> 00:35:05.12
is through exploitation an offensive tactic that is designed to disorganize enemy in depth

328
00:35:05.12 --> 00:35:10.80
exploitation usually follows a successful attack that is created or exposed some enemy

329
00:35:10.80 --> 00:35:16.24
vulnerability for example an attack that is torn a gap in enemy defenses allows us to attack vital

330
00:35:16.24 --> 00:35:22.32
enemy areas the object of exploitation is not to destroy the combat forces directly opposing us

331
00:35:22.32 --> 00:35:30.32
even though they may be weakened instead the object is to disrupt the entire enemy system by attacking

332
00:35:30.32 --> 00:35:39.76
important activities and functions it's real easy to get distracted into the little tactical

333
00:35:39.76 --> 00:35:44.24
battle that you could win as opposed to looking at what's going on strategically and how you can

334
00:35:44.24 --> 00:35:50.80
attack you how you can disrupt the entire enemy system in desert storm there was

335
00:35:50.80 --> 00:35:54.40
I'm sure most people have heard of there's something called the highway of death and there was this

336
00:35:55.36 --> 00:36:02.96
string of enemy armored vehicles that went for miles and miles and miles up into into Iraq at a

337
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:10.000
quay and that started and I don't know 100% of the story but it started with this formation of

338
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.84
a fighter attack aircraft that under most circumstances you would hit that lead element that's the

339
00:36:15.84 --> 00:36:19.76
tactical smart thing to do it, presumption of the most amount of fuel it's the best for your weapons

340
00:36:19.76 --> 00:36:26.32
and they actually bypassed that lead formation and went all the way to the tail end of the formation

341
00:36:26.32 --> 00:36:29.76
so rather than just disrupt that where the point of attack was that that lead element where our

342
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:34.08
forces had met their forces and they actually bypass that and went all the way to the tail end of

343
00:36:34.08 --> 00:36:42.08
that enemy formation and devastated that tail end and blocked the road and that allowed for the next

344
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:49.28
30 hours wave and wave and wave of aircraft to then pick off every other vehicle that had no

345
00:36:49.28 --> 00:36:55.04
place to maneuver by bypassing what seemed to be the most obvious answer which is that first line

346
00:36:55.04 --> 00:36:59.52
which they recognize this is our opportunity to shut this whole system down and that was the

347
00:36:59.52 --> 00:37:02.96
genesis of that is recognizing this is the area we need to explain and we're actually going to take

348
00:37:02.96 --> 00:37:07.60
it we're going to skip the tactical answer here and go all the way to the end of this formation

349
00:37:07.60 --> 00:37:11.44
and that created a route that the enemy couldn't recover from because they had nowhere to go because

350
00:37:11.44 --> 00:37:16.08
those guys saw the opportunity to do that at the very beginning of that campaign where is mostly

351
00:37:16.08 --> 00:37:20.64
I think you go to hit hit first element come back do it again and that gives them all that time to

352
00:37:20.64 --> 00:37:25.20
to to to recalibrate and do something different yeah especially and I don't I don't know too much about

353
00:37:25.20 --> 00:37:29.36
that scenario from the air perspective but from the ground perspective you would think well the

354
00:37:29.36 --> 00:37:33.28
lead element is the one that you're most worried about they're the ones that are closest to friendly

355
00:37:33.28 --> 00:37:38.72
forces we need to go and eliminate them first and we'll go from there so to sort of bypass that is a

356
00:37:39.52 --> 00:37:42.64
a pretty bold decision to make

357
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:51.68
continue on for example during operation desert storm in 1991 the armies

358
00:37:52.88 --> 00:37:57.84
tiger brigade was deployed by the second marine division as an exploitation force

359
00:37:57.84 --> 00:38:03.20
during the divisions final attack the brigade had the advantage over the Iraqis in speed fire

360
00:38:03.20 --> 00:38:08.32
power and night combat capabilities with these advantages the tiger brigade sliced deep into the

361
00:38:08.32 --> 00:38:15.68
rear of the Iraqi three core and sealed off the vital highway intersections north of al jara the

362
00:38:15.68 --> 00:38:23.60
result was total disruption in the Iraqi organized defense the third way to exploit

363
00:38:23.60 --> 00:38:31.12
advantages through pursuit a pursuit is an offensive tactic designed to cut off or catch a

364
00:38:31.12 --> 00:38:36.40
hostile force that has lost cohesion and is attempting to escape in order to destroy it if the

365
00:38:36.40 --> 00:38:41.60
intent is to bring about the final destruction or capture of the enemy forces then pursuit should be

366
00:38:41.60 --> 00:38:49.52
pushed with utmost vigor it is here that operations turn into routes and overwhelming

367
00:38:49.52 --> 00:38:57.04
victories often occur general grants pursuit of general ease Confederate army of northern

368
00:38:57.04 --> 00:39:08.64
Virginia from Peter's board from Peter'sburg to apomatix in April 1965 is a classic example of

369
00:39:08.64 --> 00:39:14.88
pursuit here grant pushed his forces to their limits in order to prevent leaves escape this

370
00:39:14.88 --> 00:39:22.64
ultimately led to the capture and surrender of these forces the Confederate armies lieutenant general

371
00:39:22.64 --> 00:39:30.40
Thomas J stone wall jackson summed up pursuit when he said strike the enemy and overcome him

372
00:39:30.40 --> 00:39:35.68
never give up the pursuit as long as your men have the strength to follow for an enemy

373
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:42.000
routed if hotly pursued becomes panic-stricken and can be destroyed by half their number

374
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:51.12
so you once you got them on the run run them down

375
00:39:53.68 --> 00:39:59.04
finishing the enemy ultimately we want to cultivate opportunities into a decisive advantage

376
00:39:59.04 --> 00:40:05.76
once we do we make the most of it marine cortex call for leaders who are strong finishers

377
00:40:05.76 --> 00:40:16.08
we must have a strong desire to go for the jugular I'm so thankful they put that in there

378
00:40:17.04 --> 00:40:23.92
because that's you know usually that's sort of like a like a ruffian comment to make right

379
00:40:24.96 --> 00:40:29.52
it's usually said in a negative way like dude I can't believe you went for the jugular like

380
00:40:29.52 --> 00:40:34.16
the disproportionate response yeah yeah no no we're talking that's the right response

381
00:40:34.16 --> 00:40:40.16
that's what we're gonna do go for the jugular we must be constantly trying to find and

382
00:40:40.16 --> 00:40:47.04
create the opportunity to deliver the decisive blow at the same time we must not be premature

383
00:40:47.04 --> 00:40:52.64
in our actions oh they should call this the dichotomy of leadership we must not make the

384
00:40:52.64 --> 00:40:59.76
decisive move before the conditions are right yeah when you guys talk about the idea being aggressive

385
00:40:59.76 --> 00:41:04.96
though you describe it as you use the phrase default aggressive it doesn't say be aggressive

386
00:41:04.96 --> 00:41:10.000
100% of the time there are times not to do that absolutely but really what this is talking about

387
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.20
is the type of mindset you want to cultivate is that that's gonna be my default unless I have to

388
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:19.36
I want to pull the reins back on my guys at the time to say no no this is not the time to do it

389
00:41:19.36 --> 00:41:24.48
I don't want to be in a position to say hey look change your default and get aggressive now and start

390
00:41:24.48 --> 00:41:30.40
pushing them into that breach so that that is actually right that's the default and then there are

391
00:41:30.40 --> 00:41:34.64
times if you're not not now because there's other things that play here that maybe you don't see

392
00:41:34.64 --> 00:41:37.84
and I might see from up here that they're pulling you into that we don't want to go in that

393
00:41:37.84 --> 00:41:43.52
direction but the default actually I want everyone of my guys to be aggressive and I'll pull them back

394
00:41:43.52 --> 00:41:49.44
as opposed to well I thought the best thing to do is hold off until you told me to go that's the

395
00:41:49.44 --> 00:41:54.24
default that will get you killed is is not being aggressive so doesn't say be aggressive 100% of

396
00:41:54.24 --> 00:41:59.52
the time but your default needs to be in that position yeah and what's what's the reason that's

397
00:41:59.52 --> 00:42:07.68
necessary is because the moment the split second that it takes to tell someone okay now we're

398
00:42:07.68 --> 00:42:11.92
gonna turn on our aggressiveness windows gone the windows gone and counter to that

399
00:42:12.64 --> 00:42:17.60
in the moment that it takes to tell someone hey actually we're not gonna do that they go oh okay cool

400
00:42:17.60 --> 00:42:21.92
it's not that big of a deal they didn't miss an opportunity they they they they started their

401
00:42:21.92 --> 00:42:28.000
exploitation and then they said oh we're gonna pull back fine no factor no factor one works

402
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.84
the other does not work here it this ability to finish the enemy once and for all derives from

403
00:42:35.84 --> 00:42:43.52
first from possessing an aggressive mentality second it stems from an understanding of the

404
00:42:43.52 --> 00:42:49.84
commanders intent third it stems from a keen situational awareness that helps recognize opportunities

405
00:42:49.84 --> 00:42:56.08
when they present themselves and understand when the conditions are right for action so again it's

406
00:42:56.08 --> 00:43:02.56
not 100% of the time it's when the conditions are right for action so those those are the three things

407
00:43:02.56 --> 00:43:09.04
first aggressive mentality second understanding the commanders intent third situational awareness

408
00:43:09.04 --> 00:43:16.40
so you understand if the actions are right next section use of the reserve in combat the reserve

409
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:20.40
is an important tool for exploiting success the reserve is part of the commanders combat

410
00:43:20.40 --> 00:43:26.40
power initially withheld from action in order to influence future action the reason to create

411
00:43:26.40 --> 00:43:32.96
a maintain a reserve is to provide flexibility to deal with the uncertainty chance and disorder of war

412
00:43:33.60 --> 00:43:40.40
the reserve is thus a valuable tool for maintaining adaptability in general the more uncertain the

413
00:43:40.40 --> 00:43:47.76
situation the larger should be in reserve Napoleon once said that war is composed of nothing but

414
00:43:47.76 --> 00:43:56.32
accidents and a general should never lose sight of any everything to enable him to profit from those

415
00:43:56.32 --> 00:44:04.48
accidents these accidents take the form of opportunities and crisis and crises the reserve is a key

416
00:44:04.48 --> 00:44:14.88
tactical tool for dealing with both the commander should have a purpose in mind for reserve

417
00:44:14.88 --> 00:44:19.44
employment and design it to fulfill that purpose to truly exploit success may warrant a

418
00:44:19.44 --> 00:44:25.76
assignment of the commander's best subordinate unit or a preponderance of combat power or mobility

419
00:44:25.76 --> 00:44:30.08
assets to the reserve so sometimes you're you're reserved should be your strongest and most powerful

420
00:44:30.08 --> 00:44:35.04
element whether it's the best or whether it's the the one with the most combat power those commanders

421
00:44:35.04 --> 00:44:41.28
who properly organized task and equipped their reserves are usually the ones with the capability

422
00:44:41.28 --> 00:44:47.20
to finish the enemy when the opportunity arises when central recognized the value of a reserve when

423
00:44:47.20 --> 00:44:54.64
he wrote it is in the use and withholding of their reserves that great commanders have generally

424
00:44:54.64 --> 00:45:04.08
excelled after all when once the last reserve has been thrown in commanders the commander's part is played

425
00:45:04.08 --> 00:45:10.72
the event must be left to pluck and to the fighting troops and pluck as I can hold

426
00:45:10.72 --> 00:45:17.36
term for courage basically once you've put committed reserve you're you're done you made your move

427
00:45:17.36 --> 00:45:24.72
and now you got to let it go you got to you you don't have much influence over it anymore

428
00:45:25.60 --> 00:45:32.32
and always important to keep that reserve strong always important

429
00:45:33.76 --> 00:45:38.72
financial reserve that's a big one to think about and we we deal with companies and they're

430
00:45:38.72 --> 00:45:42.96
weighing out the risk because sometimes like we need to go all in right now

431
00:45:42.96 --> 00:45:51.92
yeah and when you commit the reserve that can be the decisive moment back to the book a strong

432
00:45:51.92 --> 00:45:56.64
reserve is also way to retain the initiative if an advanced slows the reserve can increase

433
00:45:57.60 --> 00:46:02.72
moment if an advanced picks up speed the commitment of the reserve then can can then create

434
00:46:02.72 --> 00:46:10.000
around we may use the reserve to expand or exploit gaps or penetrations we may commit the reserve

435
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.32
to attack in a different location thus exploiting opportunities for success instead of reinforcing failure

436
00:46:17.04 --> 00:46:21.76
without a strong reserve even the most promising opportunities can be lost

437
00:46:24.32 --> 00:46:31.04
a classic example of the use of reserve is the battle for tarua with the second and eighth

438
00:46:31.04 --> 00:46:36.80
marine regiments held up on the assault beaches general julian smith decided to land the sixth

439
00:46:36.80 --> 00:46:42.72
marine regiment the does the division reserve to break the stalemate the first battalion six

440
00:46:42.72 --> 00:46:48.80
marines which was task organized as part of the division reserve landed on the western end of the island

441
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:55.36
passed through the third battalion second marines and from the flank conducted a swift and violent

442
00:46:55.36 --> 00:47:01.04
assault of the Japanese fortifications across the island within 48 hours the Japanese forces were

443
00:47:01.04 --> 00:47:11.52
annihilated and the island secured when you're training the gjitsu

444
00:47:13.28 --> 00:47:16.40
what you know what you consider what do you consider your reserve echo when you're training

445
00:47:16.40 --> 00:47:22.48
your jjitsu what do you mean energy reserve or yeah see that's what I think of yes

446
00:47:22.48 --> 00:47:29.04
so essentially athleticism is a reserve right where yes that's one reserve and one reserve you have

447
00:47:29.04 --> 00:47:35.60
is energy right how much energy do you have oh yeah no means do commit that yeah because let's

448
00:47:35.60 --> 00:47:41.68
face it if you commit your energy really early on against a fruitless attack yeah you're going to

449
00:47:41.68 --> 00:47:46.08
run on energy you're you're talking about a white belt right now you're talking about me that's

450
00:47:46.08 --> 00:47:54.32
what I know the most about is not I wish I knew it's that 30 seconds into it I'm too tired

451
00:47:54.32 --> 00:48:00.40
too exhausted I've overexerted myself when almost always my coach will when we'll replay it

452
00:48:00.40 --> 00:48:05.36
there was no reason to do it there was no thing that I was triggered and I like this is the time

453
00:48:05.36 --> 00:48:09.36
to to to apply my exertion yeah I mean that's what you're talking about someone who doesn't

454
00:48:09.36 --> 00:48:13.20
know when to when to do that and when they don't know they do it at all the wrong times

455
00:48:14.40 --> 00:48:20.000
yeah that's that's the way I feel when I roll I feel like I'm I have a good reserve

456
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:27.04
yeah I feel like I maintain my reserves and I don't commit them unless it's time yeah

457
00:48:27.84 --> 00:48:32.56
yeah if you can consciously be aware and the other earlier on you are the harder it is for you to

458
00:48:32.56 --> 00:48:39.20
control it more than anything where like yeah your you know jockel your level is like you almost

459
00:48:39.20 --> 00:48:44.32
that even consciously can control that you know it's like it's almost like you're you're subconsciously

460
00:48:44.32 --> 00:48:49.76
triggered to like okay you know like this is maybe this this match or this this training whatever is

461
00:48:49.76 --> 00:48:54.88
heating up so let me maintain the reserves right now you know kind of thing you still use your

462
00:48:54.88 --> 00:48:59.20
technique yeah for sure when the guy is bringing it it's kind of like dang you got to fight

463
00:48:59.20 --> 00:49:03.44
his energy with your energy you're like okay I'm not gonna do that I might take a guard pass or something

464
00:49:03.44 --> 00:49:09.60
like that and save it till it tells it's ready to let it come on yeah man it's true and at the end of the

465
00:49:09.60 --> 00:49:16.000
day that's really the the reserve it's the reserve even if you say athleticism or strength or

466
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.04
muscleing it because you're last it you effort all that takes energy yeah and that's essentially

467
00:49:21.04 --> 00:49:26.64
what you're using you even your good technique takes energy yeah yeah and let's face it if you

468
00:49:26.64 --> 00:49:31.84
had unlimited energy yeah then you would just win yeah I mean unless you're going to get someone

469
00:49:31.84 --> 00:49:37.60
that's just technically vastly superior to you yeah and when you're in a battle in a battle

470
00:49:37.60 --> 00:49:45.12
you've got one reserve and it is that energy the energy sometimes we must employ the reserve to

471
00:49:45.12 --> 00:49:51.60
deal with some crisis rendering it temporarily unavailable for commitment elsewhere in such instances

472
00:49:51.60 --> 00:49:55.84
a reserve should be reconstitute and is rapidly as possible so sometimes you got a scramble

473
00:49:57.68 --> 00:50:01.12
and move and use some energy and then as soon as you get to a good position or as

474
00:50:01.12 --> 00:50:08.64
as we should look for the opportunity to employ the reserve to reinforce success however we

475
00:50:08.64 --> 00:50:14.48
may employ the reserve however we employ we may employ the reserve we should always think of it

476
00:50:14.48 --> 00:50:22.16
as the tool for clinching victory that's also why you see a guy gets us gets a submission

477
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:30.16
thinks let me revise that a guy thinks he gets a submission and expands all of his energy trying to

478
00:50:30.16 --> 00:50:34.88
clinch the victory expands all of his reserves you see this in MMA a lot too

479
00:50:34.88 --> 00:50:39.36
one of his spends all of his reserves has nothing left the person gets out of the the

480
00:50:40.48 --> 00:50:48.56
possible submission and the game is now the tides turn into this respect marshal foc

481
00:50:49.52 --> 00:50:56.56
who is a French general he was actually the supreme allied commander in world war one

482
00:50:56.56 --> 00:51:06.48
leading troops to victory at the mar in which I don't know man like every time I read like

483
00:51:06.48 --> 00:51:10.64
the background of a jen roller if someone is getting quoted I'm always like yeah there you go

484
00:51:11.60 --> 00:51:16.64
but when you were the in charge of all allies in world war one no offense

485
00:51:16.64 --> 00:51:31.28
I'm not super I'm not super stoked on what you have to say because because yeah anyways he

486
00:51:31.28 --> 00:51:39.28
wrote that the reserve is a club prepared organized reserved carefully maintained with a view

487
00:51:39.28 --> 00:51:45.92
to carrying out one act of battle from which a result is expected the decisive attack it is

488
00:51:45.92 --> 00:51:51.20
generally and then that's the end of his quote which I'm glad I said I wasn't too impressed with him

489
00:51:51.20 --> 00:51:56.64
because I wasn't impressed with that quote is that just my own bias do I hate world war one that much no it's

490
00:51:56.64 --> 00:52:01.68
because all the other things we've talked about in the last four podcasts about requirements to be

491
00:52:01.68 --> 00:52:07.36
successful in combat or almost all missing yeah the creativity all those things that you talked about

492
00:52:08.08 --> 00:52:12.72
the human wave advancement to steal 75 yards from the enemy only to give it up at sunset

493
00:52:12.72 --> 00:52:16.32
was none of those things so I had the exact same response on my mind

494
00:52:17.52 --> 00:52:23.28
well that quote so it is generally through offensive action even in the defense that we achieve

495
00:52:23.28 --> 00:52:29.52
decisive results since the reserve represents our bid to achieve a favorable decision or to prevent

496
00:52:29.52 --> 00:52:34.48
an unfavorable one it often becomes the main effort once committed and should be supported by all

497
00:52:34.48 --> 00:52:40.000
of their elements of force along with the tangible assets used as a reserve the prudent commander must

498
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.28
also be aware of and plan for the intangible factors that impact on combat power and its sustainment

499
00:52:48.16 --> 00:52:55.68
intangible factors include fatigue that's number one I don't it doesn't say this is an order but that's

500
00:52:55.68 --> 00:53:00.32
number one and by the way that's what we've been talking about fatigue we've been talking about energy

501
00:53:00.32 --> 00:53:05.28
but the opposite of energy is fatigue so number one fatigue number two leadership quality

502
00:53:05.28 --> 00:53:14.24
no surprise number three proficiency number four morale number five teamwork number six equipment

503
00:53:14.24 --> 00:53:20.32
maintenance we build reserves also by reserving aviation swordie rates or numbers

504
00:53:20.32 --> 00:53:27.68
with holding unique or low density munitions or holding critical supplies such as fuel or petroleum

505
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:34.80
oils and lubricants for a specific goal we consider these intangible factors when creating and

506
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:44.24
tasking the reserve as we do in all assignments of task yeah indices again this is what businesses

507
00:53:44.24 --> 00:53:50.64
have to think about all the time because you do not know what the market is going to do I don't care who you

508
00:53:50.64 --> 00:53:55.52
are I don't care how long you've been doing this for you don't know what the market's going to do

509
00:53:55.52 --> 00:54:01.60
you can you have good suspicions that's great you don't know big difference yeah it's actually

510
00:54:01.60 --> 00:54:07.12
telling you to be extremely disciplined they use the term low density that just means something you don't

511
00:54:07.12 --> 00:54:12.16
have a lot of you know low density high demand items in the military are these really unique

512
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:15.68
capabilities different times aircraft and weapons but you don't have a lot of them so you have to

513
00:54:15.68 --> 00:54:20.000
be really disciplined with their use so when the time is actually right to use them they're available

514
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:30.16
to you to use them incredible concept these concepts apply not only to units initially designated

515
00:54:30.16 --> 00:54:34.48
as the reserve but also to any units since any unit can be shifted or recommitted as the reserve

516
00:54:34.48 --> 00:54:40.24
thus a commander must always be mentally prepared to redesign it roles of units and to create

517
00:54:40.24 --> 00:54:45.76
and use reserves as the situation requires I know what you know what's interesting is we see this

518
00:54:47.60 --> 00:54:53.52
we see these these businesses that end up eating other businesses is that the right word acquiring

519
00:54:53.52 --> 00:55:01.68
I guess but but basically when you get a business that maintains a solid reserve when opportunity

520
00:55:02.40 --> 00:55:09.44
reveals itself they're there to cash in yeah and buy other companies and take them over and then they

521
00:55:09.44 --> 00:55:15.84
come out of that you know if you don't maintain reserve the opportunity is there you can't exploit it

522
00:55:17.44 --> 00:55:22.88
same thing with your leadership capital right same thing with you as a leader if you sit there

523
00:55:22.88 --> 00:55:28.000
and you expend all your leadership reserve all your leadership capital you don't leave any reserve

524
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.72
you have no more for lack of a better word you have no more favors to ask as a leader should you

525
00:55:34.72 --> 00:55:39.84
be asking favors you are asking for favors that's what every time you ask a subordinate do something

526
00:55:39.84 --> 00:55:45.20
you're asking for a favor that's what you're asking you're asking them to put their trust in you

527
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:51.28
to do this thing that you want that's a favor and if you expend all your leadership capital you

528
00:55:51.28 --> 00:55:56.80
have no more favors to ask when the time is needed and you've expended those reserves you're

529
00:55:56.80 --> 00:56:01.44
not going to be followed anymore that's why relationships are so critical to all this I mean that's

530
00:56:01.44 --> 00:56:06.72
how you build up your that's your leadership reserve that's your capital that's your reserve force

531
00:56:06.72 --> 00:56:12.40
is how strong those relationships are so when the time is right you can cash in on that not that

532
00:56:12.40 --> 00:56:17.36
you cash in on them and and use them as some sort of expendable resources that you actually leverage

533
00:56:17.36 --> 00:56:22.40
that relationship and that recognition that you need to build that now you don't know when you're

534
00:56:22.40 --> 00:56:27.04
going to need it but you're going to need it and I say this answer the question all the time with

535
00:56:27.04 --> 00:56:32.88
companies about needing to real the crisis that you're dealing with now that's not you can't start

536
00:56:32.88 --> 00:56:37.20
there and if you haven't built it up the reality is there's really no answer I can give you

537
00:56:37.60 --> 00:56:40.88
because if you don't have anything in reserves it's very little you can do to leverage

538
00:56:40.88 --> 00:56:45.44
to try to solve this problem what you need to do is think about it well in advance and those

539
00:56:45.44 --> 00:56:49.92
strengths of those relationships from you contributing to them is how you have something left

540
00:56:49.92 --> 00:56:54.32
in reserve when you need it people want to know what to do get this all the time I'm flying against

541
00:56:54.32 --> 00:56:59.28
another aircraft he's directly behind me at a thousand feet and he's about to shoot his gun at me what

542
00:56:59.28 --> 00:57:05.76
I do might you know what there's not I know I'm a top-changer here but I don't have a lot of good

543
00:57:05.76 --> 00:57:10.64
answers for you you have nothing left available to to you to ask you to defend yourself against

544
00:57:10.64 --> 00:57:14.96
a situation the answer is you got to go back to the beginning uh which you can't do and people

545
00:57:14.96 --> 00:57:19.76
want the solution then and the solution is you you got to go back you got to build capital in

546
00:57:19.76 --> 00:57:23.92
other ways before you get to that position yeah that's like the how do you escape the rear naked

547
00:57:23.92 --> 00:57:30.64
choke yeah you know is it possible sure the other person can make a mistake you could you could

548
00:57:30.64 --> 00:57:36.48
do something but the bottom line is you get someone gets a legit rear naked choke on you or someone

549
00:57:36.48 --> 00:57:41.84
gets you in the triangle there's a there's a way to get out it's called submitting

550
00:57:44.88 --> 00:57:51.92
this is the conclusion of this chapter most decisive victories do not result from the initial action

551
00:57:51.92 --> 00:57:56.08
but from quickly and aggressively exploiting the opportunities created by that action

552
00:57:57.52 --> 00:58:03.76
we may find any number of ways to exploit tactical opportunity but they all have the same object to

553
00:58:03.76 --> 00:58:10.48
increase leverage until we find until we have the final opportunity to decide the issue once and

554
00:58:10.48 --> 00:58:18.64
for all in our favor a goal in marine cortex is not merely to gain advantage but to boldly and

555
00:58:18.64 --> 00:58:27.52
ruthlessly exploit that advantage to achieve final victory and now we will get to the

556
00:58:27.52 --> 00:58:38.24
eighth and final chapter of marine cortex and it is called you might think that these guys

557
00:58:38.24 --> 00:58:46.80
sitting around in a room writing doctrine would come up with more doctrine only doctrine sounding

558
00:58:47.36 --> 00:58:54.24
things things that things that they would come up with that in the in the halls of academia right

559
00:58:54.24 --> 00:59:03.44
you might think that what do they call chapter eight they call it making it happen that passes

560
00:59:03.44 --> 00:59:08.80
muster so making it happen chapter eight here's the quotes it starts off with nine tenths of

561
00:59:08.80 --> 00:59:18.80
tactics are certain and taught in books but the irrational tenth is like the king fisher flashing

562
00:59:18.80 --> 00:59:27.20
across the pool and that is the test of generals it can only be ensured by instinct sharpened by

563
00:59:27.20 --> 00:59:36.24
thought practicing the stroke so often that the that at the crisis it is as natural as a reflex

564
00:59:37.92 --> 00:59:43.44
and that's by T e Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia nine tenths of tactics are certain

565
00:59:43.44 --> 00:59:50.48
right well the irrational tenth there's a tenth of tactics that are irrational

566
00:59:51.76 --> 00:59:56.64
this is where you because this is why if you can't tap into that creativity if you can't train

567
00:59:56.64 --> 01:00:01.12
that creativity in your brain that's why you're not going to be successful well as you say you're not

568
01:00:01.12 --> 01:00:07.84
going to be eminently successful you'll be somewhat successful you'll be reliable and that's admirable

569
01:00:07.84 --> 01:00:14.96
it's good to be reliable but if you want to go next level you need to be able to be a little bit

570
01:00:14.96 --> 01:00:25.20
irrational at times to be able to handle their rational and the next quote is it cannot be too often

571
01:00:25.20 --> 01:00:32.40
repeated that in modern war and especially in modern naval war the chief factor in achieving

572
01:00:32.40 --> 01:00:40.56
triumph is what has been done in the way of thorough preparation and training before the beginning

573
01:00:40.56 --> 01:00:47.68
of the war which is which is what you were talking about Dave like why are you in that position

574
01:00:48.80 --> 01:00:54.80
and that's by by the way that's Teddy Roosevelt theodore Roosevelt president theodore Roosevelt

575
01:00:54.80 --> 01:01:02.88
rough writer theater Roosevelt metal of honor recipient theater Roosevelt who by the way his son

576
01:01:05.12 --> 01:01:12.32
Teddy Roosevelt junior metal of honor recipient d day you know old he was a d day you know old

577
01:01:12.32 --> 01:01:20.88
Teddy the young junior was on d day when he was present on the beach enormity

578
01:01:20.88 --> 01:01:30.48
oh 56 years old 56 years old demanded that he be allowed to lead his man into that situation

579
01:01:31.04 --> 01:01:40.80
and and he was not he was not like a strong healthy 56 years old you want to know why he

580
01:01:40.80 --> 01:01:47.92
wasn't strong and healthy at the age of 56 because he was still having problems health major health

581
01:01:47.92 --> 01:01:55.28
problems from the wounds that he suffered in world war one so there you go there's the quotes

582
01:01:55.28 --> 01:02:02.48
these are quotes we listen to and going to the book reading and understanding the ideas in this

583
01:02:02.48 --> 01:02:10.96
publication are the initial steps on the road to tactical accident excellence reading and understanding

584
01:02:10.96 --> 01:02:16.08
boy they throw those words out they're really easy don't they reading and understanding as if it's

585
01:02:16.08 --> 01:02:21.60
like if you read you understand that is not true reading and understanding have almost nothing to

586
01:02:21.60 --> 01:02:31.12
do with each other reading and understanding that should be capitalized and italicized and in a

587
01:02:31.12 --> 01:02:37.76
different font reading and understanding the ideas in this publication are the initial steps such as

588
01:02:37.76 --> 01:02:44.16
the initial steps on the road to tactical accidents excellence the primary way a marine leader

589
01:02:44.16 --> 01:02:50.48
becomes an able tactician is through training and education both of which are firmly rooted in

590
01:02:50.48 --> 01:02:56.16
doctrine doctrine establishes the philosophy and the practical framework for how we fight

591
01:02:57.12 --> 01:03:04.88
education develops the understanding creativity military judgment and the background essential for

592
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:10.72
effective battlefield leadership there is a lot to learn

593
01:03:10.72 --> 01:03:18.48
training follows doctrine and develops the tactical and technical proficiency that

594
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:24.24
underlies all successful military action individual and group exercises serve to integrate training

595
01:03:24.24 --> 01:03:30.80
in education producing a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts the lessons learned from

596
01:03:30.80 --> 01:03:40.08
training and operational experience then modify doctrine doctrine next section doctrine

597
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:44.96
establishes the fundamental beliefs of the Marine Corps on the subject of war and how we practice

598
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:51.44
our profession doctrine establishes a particular way of thinking about war and our way of fighting

599
01:03:51.44 --> 01:03:57.68
a philosophy for leading Marines in combat a mandate for professionalism and a common language

600
01:04:00.24 --> 01:04:07.36
that is important this one of the things when we work with companies the common language part

601
01:04:07.36 --> 01:04:12.80
these companies know that they're making mistakes they don't know how do I properly

602
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:19.84
identify what their mistakes are or what their issues are until we come in and we start teaching them

603
01:04:19.84 --> 01:04:24.08
about cover move about simple but prioritizing executed about decentralized command about default

604
01:04:24.08 --> 01:04:28.64
aggressive they they they they know there's a problem but they can't put their finger on it

605
01:04:29.52 --> 01:04:35.20
and then once they once we come and they can put their finger on it and then they can talk about it

606
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:41.76
in a common language that's like the initial foothold in victory is actually being able to

607
01:04:41.76 --> 01:04:49.76
communicate with each other about what the damn problem is doctrinal development benefits from our

608
01:04:49.76 --> 01:04:56.56
collective experience and distills its lessons to further education and training our doctrine

609
01:04:56.56 --> 01:05:03.44
within the Marine Corps begins with the philosophy contained in Marine Corps doctrinal publication

610
01:05:03.44 --> 01:05:08.40
one which is called war fighting which we covered on this podcast early on that was one of the

611
01:05:08.40 --> 01:05:15.68
earliest ones I covered and that's the reason because that one is a good solid foundation

612
01:05:15.68 --> 01:05:22.48
a good solid philosophy for doctrine for war fighting this publication underlies this philosophy

613
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:27.76
underlies publications in the Marine Corps war fighting publication series that contain tactics,

614
01:05:27.76 --> 01:05:33.44
techniques and procedures for specific functions the body of thought helps form marine

615
01:05:33.44 --> 01:05:39.12
tacticians through its implementation in education and training now they have this little

616
01:05:39.12 --> 01:05:43.20
diagram then there's been some other diagrams which I didn't really try to explain too much because

617
01:05:44.32 --> 01:05:51.52
you can get the book it's free it's a PDF but this one has it has this loop the loop has

618
01:05:51.52 --> 01:05:56.56
education it has training it has operational employment it has doctrine and they all so you you get

619
01:05:56.56 --> 01:06:03.44
educated you go train you employ operationally that operational employment becomes doctrine the

620
01:06:03.44 --> 01:06:10.96
doctrine is what we teach on so so there's the doctrinal development cycle and what I added

621
01:06:10.96 --> 01:06:19.92
into this little thing is that in between each of those steps you adapt you assess and you adjust

622
01:06:20.80 --> 01:06:26.16
so that's what's happening you educate and as you educate then you go train well when you train

623
01:06:26.16 --> 01:06:29.20
you're going to make adaptations you're going to make assessments you're going to make adjustments

624
01:06:29.20 --> 01:06:33.60
then when you deploy an employee you're going to do the same thing you're going to assess

625
01:06:33.60 --> 01:06:36.24
where you're out what worked what didn't you're going to make adaptations then you're going to put

626
01:06:36.24 --> 01:06:39.84
that in the doctrine with a doctrine you're going to take that and educate people and you're going

627
01:06:39.84 --> 01:06:45.12
to continually assess and adapt and adjust what you're what you're teaching and what you're training

628
01:06:45.12 --> 01:06:54.40
on next section education while combat provides the most instructive lessons on decision-making

629
01:06:54.40 --> 01:07:00.72
that's an understanding of the year well combat provides the most instructive lessons on decision-making

630
01:07:00.72 --> 01:07:05.84
tactical leaders cannot wait for war to begin their education we must be competent in our

631
01:07:05.84 --> 01:07:13.52
profession before our skills are called upon the lives of our Marines depend on it our education

632
01:07:13.52 --> 01:07:25.12
and tactics must develop three qualities within all tactical leaders the first quality is creative ability

633
01:07:25.12 --> 01:07:29.84
tactical leaders must be encouraged to devise and pursue unique approaches to military problems

634
01:07:31.12 --> 01:07:39.68
no rules govern ingenuity see now this is not what people expect we did the

635
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:46.96
disset we did we did the chapter on discipline and this seems to be completely counter to that that's

636
01:07:46.96 --> 01:07:55.28
why there's a dichotomy here but the number one quality to develop is creative ability and there's

637
01:07:55.28 --> 01:08:03.44
no rules that govern ingenuity the line separating boldness boldness from fool hardiness

638
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.52
is drawn by the hand of practical experience that said an education in tactics must possess an

639
01:08:09.52 --> 01:08:15.76
element of rigor to often tactical discussions lack an in-depth analysis of cause and effect

640
01:08:15.76 --> 01:08:20.64
the tactically proficient leader must learn how to analyze solutions to tactical problems

641
01:08:20.64 --> 01:08:26.16
lacking such a rigorous analysis the tactician will not learn from experience nor exercise

642
01:08:26.16 --> 01:08:32.08
creative ability this applies to everything by the way it applies to everything anything that you're

643
01:08:32.08 --> 01:08:40.000
trying to learn you should you should you should focus on this attitude of really truly doing

644
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.68
in-depth analysis and in making sure that you're not just learning how to apply the techniques as

645
01:08:47.68 --> 01:08:58.32
they were taught but how to apply them as they were not taught creatively the second quality is military

646
01:08:58.32 --> 01:09:03.04
judgment which includes the skills for gaining situational awareness and acting decisively

647
01:09:04.48 --> 01:09:11.44
the tactician must readily recognize the critical factors in any situation enemy capabilities

648
01:09:11.44 --> 01:09:16.72
whether terrain characteristics and the condition of our own forces to mention just a few

649
01:09:16.72 --> 01:09:21.44
marine leaders must be able to cut to the heart of a situation by identifying its important elements

650
01:09:21.44 --> 01:09:27.20
developing a sound plan and making clear decisions our educational approach should emphasize the

651
01:09:27.20 --> 01:09:34.72
ability to understand the mission issue clear intent and determine the main effort now for all the

652
01:09:34.72 --> 01:09:42.96
first lieutenant's at the basic school in all the other young officers and nco's that are out there

653
01:09:43.92 --> 01:09:50.56
when they talk about the tactician must readily recognize the critical factors in any situation

654
01:09:50.56 --> 01:09:57.84
I promise you that if you want to be able to do that what you need to learn how to do is to detach

655
01:09:57.84 --> 01:10:03.76
from the situation is to take a step back when there's enemy capabilities that you have to understand

656
01:10:03.76 --> 01:10:12.24
when there's terrain when there's maneuvering elements that you need to understand and recognize

657
01:10:12.24 --> 01:10:18.96
you will not be able to do that if you are staring down your a-cog or staring down your iron sites

658
01:10:18.96 --> 01:10:26.08
or you've got your helmet pressed up against your radar in an F-18 you will not see what you need to see

659
01:10:28.56 --> 01:10:38.80
so learn to detach get your head on a swivel take a step back this will make you

660
01:10:38.80 --> 01:10:52.08
infinitely better than the same you if you're sucked into your weapon system the

661
01:10:52.08 --> 01:11:00.32
sir the sooner you learn the ability to do that the amount of it leadership advantage you have

662
01:11:00.32 --> 01:11:06.16
by being able to do that in the most difficult situations is it's I don't have the words it's not

663
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:14.32
even fair it's not that's right it's not even fair you will be head and shoulders and the reason I

664
01:11:14.32 --> 01:11:19.84
I say that with a little funny tone is because I remember I had a guy that was in TU bruiser

665
01:11:19.84 --> 01:11:25.12
and he was a platoon commander and I was putting him through training and it was like some scenario

666
01:11:25.12 --> 01:11:33.28
unfolding and I was like I was like bro come here I'm like just just come with me over here

667
01:11:33.28 --> 01:11:40.64
over here was like six inches away and I'm like look around and it was so obvious I'm like hey man

668
01:11:40.64 --> 01:11:51.04
if you can be one inch if you can be one inch at altitude above everyone else you can see

669
01:11:52.32 --> 01:11:59.68
you can see a thousand times more what they can see a thousand times more so if you want to be

670
01:11:59.68 --> 01:12:08.96
able to have that situational awareness you have to learn how to detach the third quality

671
01:12:10.48 --> 01:12:16.80
is moral courage moral courage is the ability to make and carry out the decision regardless of

672
01:12:16.80 --> 01:12:26.40
personal cost it is different from and rarer than physical courage the cost of physical courage

673
01:12:26.40 --> 01:12:32.96
may be injury or death whereas the cost of moral courage may be the loss of friends popularity

674
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:40.000
prestige or career opportunities the burden of conflicting responsibilities in combat

675
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.52
responsibility for lives of subordinates support for peers loyalty to superiors and duty

676
01:12:45.52 --> 01:12:51.20
to nation can be heavy our educational efforts should lead potential leaders to work through

677
01:12:51.20 --> 01:12:59.76
the proper resolution of such conflicts in peace time leaders often need to make morally

678
01:12:59.76 --> 01:13:05.04
correct decisions in combat but there will rarely be time for deep moral or ethical

679
01:13:05.04 --> 01:13:12.24
contemplation on the battlefield now what's interesting about this is first of all they say

680
01:13:12.24 --> 01:13:18.48
it's rarer than physical courage and then it says the cost of physical courage may be injury or death

681
01:13:18.48 --> 01:13:24.96
to to most people that sounds like the worst things possible but then they're saying but

682
01:13:24.96 --> 01:13:31.92
whereas the cost of moral courage may be loss of friends popularity prestige and this is the

683
01:13:31.92 --> 01:13:40.40
more I find most interesting or career opportunities so what they are saying right there I mean

684
01:13:40.40 --> 01:13:46.96
obviously if my boss wants me to make a certain correct moral decision he's going to promote me

685
01:13:46.96 --> 01:13:52.88
but what they're saying in that statement right there that there are times when you will be making

686
01:13:53.52 --> 01:14:00.72
decisions that are morally correct that will actually hurt your career that's the statement

687
01:14:00.72 --> 01:14:06.56
or you will be at risk of hurting your career I can think of a thousand examples of this right off

688
01:14:06.56 --> 01:14:13.52
the top of my head from being in seal potions you know because you you want what happens to

689
01:14:13.52 --> 01:14:18.32
leaders sometimes in a seal platoon is they don't want it they're insecure about their leadership

690
01:14:18.88 --> 01:14:22.16
and there's something going on that they don't feel comfortable about

691
01:14:23.20 --> 01:14:28.16
but they don't have the moral courage to say anything and part of that is because hey they they say

692
01:14:28.16 --> 01:14:32.80
oh this is this shouldn't be happening and as soon as they say that they're drawn the spotlight on

693
01:14:32.80 --> 01:14:37.60
themselves and they're not really sure about themselves and all of a sudden they feel like

694
01:14:37.60 --> 01:14:40.96
if their boss is going to look at them like they don't know how to lead their men and now I'm not

695
01:14:40.96 --> 01:14:46.24
going to get promoted like that whole thing on once you know life and I were talking yesterday

696
01:14:47.44 --> 01:14:56.88
and you know he was like hey you told me as he was saying that I told him like if you don't

697
01:14:56.88 --> 01:15:03.44
do this you're failing as a leader and and what he realized was much of what life

698
01:15:03.44 --> 01:15:11.52
Babin had in his head was correct but he just didn't really have the confidence yet to say

699
01:15:12.48 --> 01:15:18.64
to implement you know to implement it until I was like hey man if you allow this to happen

700
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:24.80
that that's actually you being a bad leader whether it was you know and I'm just talking about anything

701
01:15:24.80 --> 01:15:29.12
any anything that you dis you you know what's right you know what's wrong or at least you have a

702
01:15:29.12 --> 01:15:33.76
strong suspicion okay you know what this doesn't seem right to me but I'm not really convicted of it

703
01:15:33.76 --> 01:15:39.60
so I'm just not going to say anything I'll just let it kind of let it go and that is wrong and that's

704
01:15:39.60 --> 01:15:47.20
what takes this moral courage to step up when you're going to be unpopular when you're going to be

705
01:15:47.20 --> 01:15:53.52
the guy that says hey guess what we're not going to do that and in the team there's a lot of it is

706
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:59.68
you're you're a pussy you're a wimp if you don't if all you just need to get on board what we're doing

707
01:15:59.68 --> 01:16:04.48
that's no actually I don't what we're actually going to do what the right thing is here legally

708
01:16:06.96 --> 01:16:12.96
most of the catastrophic events that I saw in my career weren't on the battlefield weren't

709
01:16:12.96 --> 01:16:18.000
getting beat in combat or out maneuvered by an enemy most of the catastrophic events were teams

710
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
squadrons what have you that had leaders that allowed those things to happen and build over time because

711
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.28
they were afraid to get involved and eventually something catastrophic would have it inside that team

712
01:16:29.92 --> 01:16:33.52
that ironically ended up being a reflection of their leadership anyway so the thing that they're

713
01:16:33.52 --> 01:16:38.96
most afraid of was what culminated anyways reflection of their leadership allowing those

714
01:16:39.68 --> 01:16:44.40
questionable ethical behaviors those questionable ways that we allow our Marines to behave

715
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:51.28
out in town or or even in the space out of a fear of doing what seems to be unpopular or being

716
01:16:51.28 --> 01:16:58.64
what you're just described those are the ones when I saw squadrons suffer you talked about

717
01:16:58.64 --> 01:17:04.08
steel potatoes getting disbanded things like that it wasn't because they were getting beat

718
01:17:04.08 --> 01:17:08.72
at the point of friction in combat it was that things had happened inside the organization

719
01:17:08.72 --> 01:17:12.80
that leadership tolerated and ended of leading to what they were afraid of in the first place anyway

720
01:17:12.80 --> 01:17:19.12
which was the they were viewed upon as a leader who couldn't lead their team and the greatest risk

721
01:17:19.12 --> 01:17:23.36
that I saw in leadership in the Marine Corps was allowing the people around you to behave in ways

722
01:17:23.36 --> 01:17:30.88
that you knew were wrong but the fear of looking on part are being unpopular by getting involved in

723
01:17:30.88 --> 01:17:36.48
those things because they weren't cool or whatever they were we're the undoing of the more

724
01:17:36.48 --> 01:17:40.96
leaders in the Marine Corps than anything that ever did in an airplane or as a commander in some sort

725
01:17:40.96 --> 01:17:53.12
of tactical situation so I went through this and to be quite honest with you I cheated

726
01:17:54.64 --> 01:18:04.56
I pulled them a newver on my troops that allowed me to come at this from an angle that they

727
01:18:04.56 --> 01:18:11.20
could not argue with and when I used to teach the young officers I called this the Trump card

728
01:18:11.20 --> 01:18:18.48
the Trump card I had the Trump card in my back pocket if you wanted to argue with me that you wanted

729
01:18:18.48 --> 01:18:27.28
to do this thing or do this behavior or or act in a certain way you wanted to do that and what

730
01:18:27.28 --> 01:18:33.92
you were saying was hey jocco you're kind of a pussy because you don't want to do this or you're

731
01:18:33.92 --> 01:18:41.12
not going to allow this or you don't want us to act in that in that way my Trump card was

732
01:18:41.12 --> 01:18:47.44
real simple and real straightforward and a 100% of the time it was the ace of spades and what I

733
01:18:47.44 --> 01:18:53.60
would say to guys is so what you're saying what you're saying is you would rather do this behavior

734
01:18:53.60 --> 01:19:01.28
and risk getting in trouble and not go to war not go to combat because you rather do this behavior

735
01:19:01.28 --> 01:19:07.76
if that's where you're at fuck you I don't want you on my team I don't want to be associated with you

736
01:19:08.32 --> 01:19:14.72
I'm here to go to war I waited my whole life to go to war that's what I was born to do and to have you

737
01:19:14.72 --> 01:19:21.60
put that possibility at risk because of because you want to do some behavior one night one little thing

738
01:19:21.60 --> 01:19:28.80
that you want to do and you're talking to me like I'm a bitch you're a bitch don't don't even bring that

739
01:19:28.80 --> 01:19:35.76
up to me again that was my Trump card I got a text the other day from one of the guys that you

740
01:19:35.76 --> 01:19:45.44
still work for me and he said he said hey I was thinking about what you told us about behavior

741
01:19:45.44 --> 01:19:54.000
and he said this little quote to me I told him I said if any of you do anything that prevents us

742
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:03.60
from going to war I will never forgive you and I will hate you forever and I laughed for you

743
01:20:03.60 --> 01:20:10.32
because I don't remember everything that I said but that right there that's to me as the ultimate

744
01:20:10.32 --> 01:20:17.92
Trump card oh you'd rather you'd rather go out and get drunk than go and fight al Qaeda that's what

745
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:24.56
you rather do you that's what you're telling me right now and who can argue with that you can't argue

746
01:20:24.56 --> 01:20:30.32
with that and and you know what guys wouldn't argue with that the team guys when you know what they want

747
01:20:30.32 --> 01:20:34.16
to do they want to fight and go to war okay there's some there's a small percent of course

748
01:20:35.04 --> 01:20:39.12
that don't really want to do that but the guys that were with me that's what they wanted to do

749
01:20:39.12 --> 01:20:50.72
so that right there is the Trump card and it's the truth the the absolute truth I don't care

750
01:20:50.72 --> 01:20:57.28
about anything else there's enemy there's bad guys there's there's a group of human beings on this

751
01:20:57.28 --> 01:21:02.64
planet that want to destroy our way of life and I would I have the opportunity to go and hunt them

752
01:21:02.64 --> 01:21:06.48
down and kill them and you're going to take that away or you're going to put that in any kind of

753
01:21:06.48 --> 01:21:21.52
risk effort not happening not happening moral courage next section and effective leader willingly

754
01:21:21.52 --> 01:21:27.76
takes on the risks which come with military responsibilities in that light the greatest failing of a

755
01:21:27.76 --> 01:21:37.60
leader is a failure to lead two steadfast rules apply first in situations clearly requiring independent

756
01:21:37.60 --> 01:21:46.40
decisions a leader has the solemn duty to make them whether the subsequent action succeeds or fails

757
01:21:46.40 --> 01:21:52.16
the leader has made an honorable effort the broad exercise of initiative by all Marines will

758
01:21:52.16 --> 01:22:02.48
likely carry the battle in spite of individual errors so you make a call and look if you mess up a

759
01:22:02.48 --> 01:22:07.68
little bit don't worry there's 250 other Marines that are making decisions and they're going to

760
01:22:07.68 --> 01:22:16.96
the majority of those decisions are going to be okay so we got you second in action and omission

761
01:22:16.96 --> 01:22:24.24
based on a failure of moral courage are much worse than any judgment error reflecting a sincere

762
01:22:24.24 --> 01:22:36.88
effort to act so not doing anything is like the mortal sin errors resulting from such moral failings

763
01:22:38.24 --> 01:22:43.52
lead not only to tactical setbacks but to the breakdown of faith in the chain of command

764
01:22:43.52 --> 01:22:49.04
proper training education and concern leadership are the keys to instilling the qualities

765
01:22:49.68 --> 01:22:55.84
of creative ability military judgment and moral courage in the minds of all Marines

766
01:23:00.08 --> 01:23:06.80
next section training good tactics depend upon sound technical skills

767
01:23:06.80 --> 01:23:12.96
these are the techniques and procedures which enable us to move shoot and communicate

768
01:23:14.16 --> 01:23:19.84
I made a little note here move shoot and communicate in the team is that way you always here

769
01:23:19.84 --> 01:23:26.56
I hear backwards right you hear shoot moving communicate right I believe that is correct Marine Corps

770
01:23:27.60 --> 01:23:34.24
please adjust this we need to shoot first we need to put down cover fire so we can move we're not

771
01:23:34.24 --> 01:23:37.76
going to move shoot and communicate we're in a shoot move and communicate that's what we say in the

772
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:43.04
teams I'm pretty sure that's what the Marine Corps means as well we achieve technical competence

773
01:23:43.04 --> 01:23:48.40
through training we build skills through repetition training also instills confidence in weapons and

774
01:23:48.40 --> 01:23:52.72
equipment it develops the specialized skills essential to functioning in combat

775
01:23:53.92 --> 01:24:01.76
one of the ultimate aims of training is speed essential to speed is the requirement for accuracy

776
01:24:01.76 --> 01:24:06.72
speed without accuracy may be counterproductive and causes more damage than an then in action

777
01:24:08.40 --> 01:24:14.96
whether Marines compute firing data practice rifle marksmanship or weapons gunnery

778
01:24:14.96 --> 01:24:21.68
rearm and refuel aircraft repair vehicles stock or transport supplies or communicate information

779
01:24:21.68 --> 01:24:27.68
the speed and accuracy of their actions determine the tempo of the overall force

780
01:24:27.68 --> 01:24:34.32
training develops the proficiency which enables this effective combination of speed and accuracy

781
01:24:37.76 --> 01:24:43.36
all the things you're talking about here this is this is really the first time this tactics

782
01:24:43.36 --> 01:24:46.96
gets into tactical components of the things these individual Marines are supposed to do

783
01:24:47.68 --> 01:24:53.12
but something this that was mentioned earlier that that set the stage on this was what this

784
01:24:53.12 --> 01:25:01.36
pulls from the first doctrinal pub in the Marine Corps is pub one one tack one is called

785
01:25:02.24 --> 01:25:08.48
warfighting and that is the unifying thing that ties every Marine together

786
01:25:09.12 --> 01:25:12.64
is the understanding that you and it's really all the things you've just been talking about

787
01:25:13.20 --> 01:25:19.76
you are here as a war fighter first of all why would you do anything why would you

788
01:25:19.76 --> 01:25:25.84
expand any energy or take any action to do anything that could potentially undermine your ability to

789
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:32.08
do that whether it's get drunk on a Friday night because it's it's what the dudes are doing

790
01:25:32.08 --> 01:25:38.16
what the bros are doing to do anything they would undermine but it's also the common belief

791
01:25:38.16 --> 01:25:46.24
system that we all have that that's what we do we are here to fight wars period and every single

792
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:52.64
thing I'm going to do whether it's putting gas in an airplane pulling the trigger or memorizing

793
01:25:52.64 --> 01:26:00.24
have a logistics train whatever it is you are here to be a war fighter and the only way any of

794
01:26:00.24 --> 01:26:04.72
this works is that common belief that all Marines have that that's why you're here and that's

795
01:26:04.72 --> 01:26:10.32
what you do and it guides every single thing you do but without that first understanding of what

796
01:26:10.32 --> 01:26:15.76
it is that we are none of this other stuff works you can't get to pub two and pub three and pub six

797
01:26:15.76 --> 01:26:20.64
if you don't understand what it is that we are and that's I think that's why they were describing

798
01:26:20.64 --> 01:26:28.40
all those are the things polls from that overwriting understanding of what you are and now what

799
01:26:28.40 --> 01:26:32.80
we're fighting tactically it could take a thousand different forms as a thousand different things

800
01:26:32.80 --> 01:26:41.52
tactically you can do to be a war fighter just think it's how many organizations we work at where what they

801
01:26:41.52 --> 01:26:49.68
do is the thing that they do I do logistics I do more but they don't actually understand what they

802
01:26:49.68 --> 01:26:56.08
are and the tactical application of what you do unless you understand what that fits into it doesn't

803
01:26:56.08 --> 01:27:02.08
doesn't do anything in the end. I think the idea of war fighting being what we do is sort of driving

804
01:27:02.08 --> 01:27:08.08
everything is the coolest it's the coolest thing. Yeah and it's one of those things as you just said

805
01:27:08.08 --> 01:27:14.24
if that thread gets lost by someone that's out working on vehicles if that thread gets lost by

806
01:27:14.24 --> 01:27:21.52
someone that's delivering fuel if that thread gets lost by someone that is computing firing data

807
01:27:22.56 --> 01:27:29.92
then the whole thing all fall apart and that's the same in any organization if we lose track of the

808
01:27:29.92 --> 01:27:39.20
underlying theme and thread of what it is we are trying to do we can fall apart and who's responsible

809
01:27:39.20 --> 01:27:43.76
for making sure that happens that that that that that doesn't happen that we understand what our

810
01:27:43.76 --> 01:27:55.76
underlying core mission is that's oscillator's. Continuing small unit training should focus on

811
01:27:55.76 --> 01:28:02.72
proficiency in such techniques and procedures as immediate action drills battle drills and unit

812
01:28:03.60 --> 01:28:09.44
standard operating procedures practicing to reach technical proficiency applies to all types of

813
01:28:09.44 --> 01:28:15.28
units whether a section of aircraft executing air combat maneuvers a maintenance contact team

814
01:28:15.28 --> 01:28:20.56
repairing a vehicle under fire and artillery gun team conducting displace materials or rifle

815
01:28:20.56 --> 01:28:27.36
squad conducting an in-stripe beach breach of an obstacle we develop and refine these measured

816
01:28:27.36 --> 01:28:34.48
measures so that units gain and maintain the speed and accuracy essential for success in battle

817
01:28:35.76 --> 01:28:40.80
staffs like units and individual leaders must train to increase speed and accuracy

818
01:28:40.80 --> 01:28:46.72
staffs increase speed by accomplishing three things first by obtaining and organizing

819
01:28:46.72 --> 01:28:53.12
information to help the commander and themselves understand the situation boy this is like

820
01:28:53.12 --> 01:28:58.40
every this should be printed on the walls of every staff organization in the US military

821
01:28:58.40 --> 01:29:03.92
second by understanding the commander's decision and core decision and coordinating efforts to

822
01:29:03.92 --> 01:29:11.60
focus combat power to achieve the commander's goal and third by monitoring events maintaining

823
01:29:11.60 --> 01:29:17.04
situational awareness and anticipating and and and and adapt and adapting to changes

824
01:29:18.24 --> 01:29:24.16
as staffs train they increase accuracy by becoming more proficient both in their respective

825
01:29:24.16 --> 01:29:33.76
areas and in functioning as a team that's what the staffs are trying to do and notice that if you're

826
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:39.04
in a staff you better know what the commander's goal is you better understand what that intent is

827
01:29:39.04 --> 01:29:42.96
if you don't understand what that intent is if you don't understand that goal is you are completely

828
01:29:42.96 --> 01:29:48.40
lost and if you're commander and there's any doubt in your military mind what's so ever

829
01:29:48.96 --> 01:29:54.16
that your staff doesn't know what your intent is and what your goal is you better make it crystal clear

830
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:04.000
field marshal Irwin Ramwell Ramwell knew the value of speed and accuracy for his staff when he

831
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.24
wrote a commander must accustomed his staff to a high tempo from the outset and continuously

832
01:30:10.24 --> 01:30:19.04
keep them up to it if he wants allows himself to be satisfied with norms or anything less than

833
01:30:19.04 --> 01:30:28.64
an all-out effort he gives up the race from the starting post and will sooner or later be taught a

834
01:30:28.64 --> 01:30:41.76
bitter lesson allow yourself to be satisfied with the norms allowing anything less than an all-out

835
01:30:41.76 --> 01:30:50.24
effort you give up the race from the starting post that's what I'm talking about

836
01:30:50.24 --> 01:31:00.72
now can we burn people out absolutely yes can we burn ourselves out absolutely so you what you have

837
01:31:00.72 --> 01:31:05.36
to know what you have to learn and what you have to understand is you have to understand and learn

838
01:31:05.36 --> 01:31:10.56
when you're going to conserve energy and when you're going to go on the attack you know that's

839
01:31:10.56 --> 01:31:18.80
that's wrong talking and that sounds cool but trust me and I've seen it and we and I know you've seen

840
01:31:18.80 --> 01:31:24.56
it in the military plenty of commanders that they lose touch with their people and they just burn them out

841
01:31:25.12 --> 01:31:32.32
and they have horrible command climates and more important they're they become ineffective at

842
01:31:32.32 --> 01:31:41.60
executing their mission yeah that's the real problem continuing this speed and efficiency of a unit

843
01:31:41.60 --> 01:31:47.20
to depend not only on the technical proficiency of its individual members but also in large part

844
01:31:47.20 --> 01:31:54.88
upon its cohesiveness such cohesion requires both personal personality and solid leadership

845
01:31:56.08 --> 01:32:01.52
training should also prepare marines for the uniquely physical nature of combat

846
01:32:01.52 --> 01:32:07.12
living in caring for themselves in a Spartan environment confronting the natural elements

847
01:32:07.12 --> 01:32:13.60
and experiencing the discomfort of being hungry thirsty and tired are as essential in preparing

848
01:32:13.60 --> 01:32:20.72
for combat duty as any skills training the point is not to train individuals on how to be miserable

849
01:32:21.76 --> 01:32:28.88
but rather on how to be effective when miserable or exhausted yeah think about that for a second

850
01:32:28.88 --> 01:32:33.28
we're not going to do this so we can survive these difficult environments we're going to do this

851
01:32:33.28 --> 01:32:40.08
so we can thrive and take advantage of these situations the cold in Korea we're not going to train

852
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:44.72
to for that just so we can survive the cold we're actually going to use it to destroy our enemies

853
01:32:47.92 --> 01:32:52.32
you talked about a little bit earlier about leaders that will just they'll lose side of what

854
01:32:52.32 --> 01:32:55.44
they're trying to do and and what they'll do they'll just push really hard and it's not that

855
01:32:55.44 --> 01:32:59.20
they're pushing harder than their other counterparts it's that they don't understand when and why

856
01:32:59.20 --> 01:33:02.48
they're pushing hard they don't know when they should build up the reserves and when they're

857
01:33:02.48 --> 01:33:07.28
so they just go hard because they know going hard we should go hard and it isn't that they're

858
01:33:07.28 --> 01:33:11.52
going harder and they burn them out it's that there's no connection to why they're going hard

859
01:33:11.52 --> 01:33:15.28
to what they're actually going to try to accomplish in that training and that disconnect of

860
01:33:15.28 --> 01:33:19.12
why they're doing what they're doing versus what they're doing and I've been in units where the

861
01:33:19.12 --> 01:33:23.36
leader just we just go hard and a lot of people are like what the hell are we doing and nobody

862
01:33:23.36 --> 01:33:29.36
knows and those units will fall apart before they actually exceed their physical capacity to do

863
01:33:29.36 --> 01:33:34.96
things or as other units can actually you can actually go harder if they understand why so that

864
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:38.56
thing you really want to do if you can make the connection to the reason they're doing it you can

865
01:33:38.56 --> 01:33:42.32
go as hard as you want and it's not that going hard that burns the units out it's having no

866
01:33:42.32 --> 01:33:46.56
idea why they're going hard or when they should go hard those are the units that burn out

867
01:33:47.60 --> 01:33:51.84
here's where you can run into a problem with this attitude of rommels of hey we're just going to

868
01:33:51.84 --> 01:33:56.56
go harder 100% all the time you don't know you're not you're you're utilizing your reserves out of the

869
01:33:56.56 --> 01:34:00.80
gate that's what you're doing and so that's a problem and what the the problem is

870
01:34:00.80 --> 01:34:11.28
where we're a leader is even more inaccurate in their assessments than they think

871
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.32
is that it's the it's the idea that I've talked about of the the guidance leading PT

872
01:34:19.20 --> 01:34:25.36
and when you're leading PT PT is kind of fun because when I'm leading PT I guess what we're doing

873
01:34:25.36 --> 01:34:30.32
we're doing pull ups because I'm good at pull ups right that's what we're doing and so we're

874
01:34:30.32 --> 01:34:34.56
doing new autonapulups and if you're not good at pull ups PT sucks for you and by the way

875
01:34:34.56 --> 01:34:37.20
I didn't tell you when we were going to stop it and tell you how many were doing I'm so good

876
01:34:37.20 --> 01:34:43.28
doing pull ups you should be happy because I'm happy and so you miss you miss calculate

877
01:34:44.72 --> 01:34:49.20
how much the guys can actually take and there's a decent chance that they can't take as much as you

878
01:34:50.32 --> 01:34:55.36
because they're not leading it that's why when you put subordinate leaders in charge it allows

879
01:34:55.36 --> 01:35:00.16
you to more closely and accurately judge how much they can actually take and by the way they'll push

880
01:35:00.16 --> 01:35:06.000
harder if they're running it that's a thing that'll actually go harder they'll give you more if you

881
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.20
let them run with it if you think you're going to lead from the front and and whip them to keep

882
01:35:13.20 --> 01:35:18.88
up with you you're wrong you will not get the same mileage out of them as you will if you say hey

883
01:35:18.88 --> 01:35:25.92
you take this and run with it so be careful they're young first lieutenant ramo out there

884
01:35:25.92 --> 01:35:32.08
back to the book likewise training should enable us to take appropriate action in any environment

885
01:35:32.08 --> 01:35:39.44
and at any time this readiness includes operating during inclement weather and periods of limited

886
01:35:39.44 --> 01:35:45.92
visibility we must make terrain weather and darkness our allies if we are to gain advantage and deliver

887
01:35:45.92 --> 01:35:52.72
decisive force at a time in place of our choosing we can neither anticipate nor appreciate the inherent

888
01:35:52.72 --> 01:35:57.84
friction that these natural factors produce unless we experience them.

889
01:36:00.24 --> 01:36:06.24
Next section training and educational methods that's such a that's here that's boring title number

890
01:36:06.24 --> 01:36:11.84
one that's the only that's the first boring subsection we've got training and educational methods

891
01:36:13.36 --> 01:36:16.64
okay I don't know we expect a little bit of higher standards

892
01:36:16.64 --> 01:36:25.92
there is no single best approach to developing tactical proficiency however any approach should be

893
01:36:25.92 --> 01:36:31.84
adaptable to all echelons and grades the environment should be one that is challenging and conducive

894
01:36:31.84 --> 01:36:38.72
to creative thinking like all preparation for war training should reflect the rigors of that environment

895
01:36:38.72 --> 01:36:48.24
the following examples may provide some tools for developing tactical proficiency in marines.

896
01:36:48.24 --> 01:36:49.92
1. Professional Reading and Historical Study

897
01:36:51.20 --> 01:36:56.96
because of the relative infrequency of actual combat experiences in most military leaders careers

898
01:36:56.96 --> 01:37:02.32
marines must seek to expand their understanding through other less direct means the study of

899
01:37:02.32 --> 01:37:09.60
military history is critical to developing to developing judgment and insight in enables us to see

900
01:37:09.60 --> 01:37:15.76
how successful commanders have fought through and fought through the situations they faced

901
01:37:17.12 --> 01:37:25.76
not many people can do it instinctively few possess the rare native ability to think militarily

902
01:37:25.76 --> 01:37:32.80
even those few can enhance their abilities through study and practice what general matters say about

903
01:37:32.80 --> 01:37:36.16
the thing the whole time the game matters just all I was thinking about in the last two minutes was

904
01:37:36.16 --> 01:37:41.68
matters yeah and he said he said that every situation he saw yeah it's seen it before

905
01:37:41.68 --> 01:37:45.60
yeah he wasn't afraid of any situation because he had prepared for that's right that whole time

906
01:37:45.60 --> 01:37:54.96
yes just his approach to personal personal library of 5,000 books and you you take 5,000

907
01:37:54.96 --> 01:38:02.16
and and I imagine that when Mattis reads them he's reading them with this incredible depth

908
01:38:02.16 --> 01:38:06.72
yeah not as a homework assignment it's not a homework assignment he's not 21 year old first

909
01:38:06.72 --> 01:38:12.80
lieutenant David R. Burke saying okay well I gotta read this before I can go grab a beer with the

910
01:38:12.80 --> 01:38:16.72
boys what am I enabling learning objectives so I can write him down real quick so I can move on to

911
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:21.76
something yeah no he's reading that with the level of death and understanding that he not just

912
01:38:21.76 --> 01:38:26.56
that but he puts them all together he wasn't afraid of any situation because he had prepared for

913
01:38:26.56 --> 01:38:30.88
every possible situation that was out there through study of history because guess what the

914
01:38:30.88 --> 01:38:35.52
stuff has all happened at least one other time before and maybe twice you know what I've admitted to

915
01:38:36.48 --> 01:38:43.44
a couple times in the recent past and you've been with me when I've admitted to it there's nothing

916
01:38:43.44 --> 01:38:49.84
that I like more than something that I didn't expect or that seems problematic or chaotic

917
01:38:49.84 --> 01:38:57.28
that's what I want like that's that's when I that's when my that's when my adrenaline just

918
01:38:57.28 --> 01:39:03.68
gets a little bit of a really because when I've seen it 90 million times it's like cool I'm down

919
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:08.72
like what will handle this problem but man I like it when something comes at me that I'm not expecting

920
01:39:08.72 --> 01:39:16.32
I love that I've loved that for a long time and part of the reason is because it's just an experience once

921
01:39:16.32 --> 01:39:24.80
again it's an it's an it's an opportunity to put some of that creative muscle to work and that's fun

922
01:39:27.28 --> 01:39:32.40
continuing on historical studies provide the most readily available source of indirect experience

923
01:39:32.40 --> 01:39:38.80
in our profession these studies describe the leadership considerations the horrors of war the

924
01:39:38.80 --> 01:39:47.60
sacrifices endured the commitment involved the resources required and much more as if that's not enough

925
01:39:47.60 --> 01:39:54.08
and much more these studies include biographies and autobiographies of military figures books on

926
01:39:54.08 --> 01:39:59.84
specific battles wars and military institutions unit histories after action reports films and documentaries

927
01:40:00.48 --> 01:40:05.68
group discussions help to expand the insights into leadership and battle that we have gained

928
01:40:05.68 --> 01:40:15.20
through individual study and this is a solid 98% of what this podcast is biographies autobiographies

929
01:40:15.20 --> 01:40:22.96
books on specific battles wars military institutions that's what we do here and like

930
01:40:23.76 --> 01:40:31.28
Lidel Hart said when you study about war you're gonna learn about life that's why

931
01:40:31.28 --> 01:40:37.60
so many people listen this podcast that aren't first lieutenant's or kernels or generals

932
01:40:37.60 --> 01:40:42.000
they listen because they go oh yeah I can take that same theory and apply it to my business to my

933
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.08
family to my life professional readings and study are not solely the responsibility of military

934
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:56.64
schools individuals cannot afford to wait for attendance at a military school to begin a course of

935
01:40:56.64 --> 01:41:03.60
self-directed study military professionalism demands that individuals and units find time to

936
01:41:03.60 --> 01:41:09.92
increase the professional knowledge through professional reading professional military education classes

937
01:41:09.92 --> 01:41:21.36
and individual study it's on you no you cannot wait for your battalion your regiment your squadron

938
01:41:21.36 --> 01:41:30.16
to train you you cannot wait for them and if you wait for that you are just wasting so much

939
01:41:30.16 --> 01:41:42.80
opportunity to be so much better at this job tactical exercises tactics tactical success

940
01:41:42.80 --> 01:41:47.12
evolves from the synthesis of training and education the creative application of technical

941
01:41:47.12 --> 01:41:53.60
skills based on sound judgment exercises enable leaders to practice decision making and

942
01:41:53.60 --> 01:42:00.88
individuals staffs and units to practice perfect collective skills exercises also serve to test

943
01:42:00.88 --> 01:42:06.88
and improve tactics techniques and procedures immediate actions battle drills and combat

944
01:42:06.88 --> 01:42:11.84
standard operating procedures and by the way I've been changing state the it keeps saying

945
01:42:11.84 --> 01:42:21.60
standing operating just saying standard I'm saying standard rewrite this thing and exercise

946
01:42:21.60 --> 01:42:26.000
should serve as a units internal assessment of the quality of its training and education and

947
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.80
not as grading criteria for higher commands oh that's a nice little thing we're not grading

948
01:42:32.80 --> 01:42:39.76
you for higher commands we actually just want you to learn like you know those schools where they say

949
01:42:39.76 --> 01:42:44.88
will you not gonna get graded here and it sounds super lame and it looks like awesome well think about

950
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:48.72
if you if you said look what what I really want you to do here is learn and I remember saying that

951
01:42:48.72 --> 01:42:52.88
when I was running trade it'd be like listen man I just want you to be ready for combat that's what

952
01:42:52.88 --> 01:42:58.88
I want about I'm not looking to to to write you up or anything I just want you to be ready for combat

953
01:42:58.88 --> 01:43:04.88
bro that's what I want like if that could have been a good introduction to Lieutenant Dave Burke

954
01:43:04.88 --> 01:43:10.88
is like listen we don't worry about where you're gonna break out in this class what I want you

955
01:43:10.88 --> 01:43:17.36
to do is learn and understand what we're saying to you it's hard to do that it's hard it's so

956
01:43:17.36 --> 01:43:24.40
hard to do that I think of how many things that I gaffed off early in my career simply because I

957
01:43:24.40 --> 01:43:29.36
didn't understand that it was gonna make me better I just didn't make the connection of my mind

958
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:34.32
that doing this not the motions but actually listening and learning to whatever it is that they were

959
01:43:34.32 --> 01:43:40.96
teaching me would make me better and more successful if you told me that there was a it was a competitive

960
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:46.64
thing there was a ranking and a grading and an measurement that you were gonna get I'm all in man oh yeah

961
01:43:46.64 --> 01:43:53.28
I'm all in why would not but the number of things that I was I just and I know how many

962
01:43:53.28 --> 01:43:56.88
young leaders are out there listening not just in the military and the business were all two

963
01:43:56.88 --> 01:44:05.04
young leaders are listening to this I ignored so many early in my career it just took me a while

964
01:44:05.04 --> 01:44:09.60
to figure that what you just just got I just didn't understand it and I wish I could go back and tell

965
01:44:09.60 --> 01:44:14.88
second Lieutenant Burke just pay attention yeah just pay attention this is gonna pay dividends

966
01:44:14.88 --> 01:44:19.76
you're gonna be able to cash in on this down the road and your peers are gonna wonder what the hell

967
01:44:19.76 --> 01:44:24.64
is going on with you because you're gonna be so far out in front of where they are if you just pay

968
01:44:24.64 --> 01:44:30.56
attention this stuff one of the things that you can do to make that happen in my opinion is you

969
01:44:30.56 --> 01:44:37.68
you actually have to try and put yourself into the scenario that you're being that you're being taught

970
01:44:37.68 --> 01:44:44.96
that you're reading and I'll tell you you can hear it when I'm when I'm reading when I'm reading

971
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:55.28
with the old breed man my brain is there it is there when I'm reading one source work when I'm reading

972
01:44:55.28 --> 01:45:02.80
the coldest colder than hell when I'm reading excursion in hell my brain my mind is there I'm

973
01:45:02.80 --> 01:45:11.12
putting myself right there that's what I'm doing when you get taught something when you hear something

974
01:45:11.12 --> 01:45:17.44
put yourself there put it into put it into your world and put yourself into that world

975
01:45:18.88 --> 01:45:25.44
being able to do that the earlier you can start doing that the better comprehension you will

976
01:45:25.44 --> 01:45:34.40
receive from whatever it is that is being bestowed upon you and that that's it's hard to do

977
01:45:34.40 --> 01:45:41.92
it's hard to do and now I go talk to the young the young seals and nowadays I mean oh

978
01:45:43.60 --> 01:45:53.12
you can see the kids that are listening because they are absorbing and they are in it you can

979
01:45:53.12 --> 01:45:58.88
see it in their on their face and there'll be a couple there'll be a couple that are they're just

980
01:45:58.88 --> 01:46:05.04
not there they're like oh you know I have to listen to another person talk right now yeah and

981
01:46:05.04 --> 01:46:09.76
that there'll be a that's usually a pretty small number but then the guys that are just

982
01:46:10.32 --> 01:46:17.60
they're they're absorbing what you're saying it's like they're gaining actual experience okay

983
01:46:17.60 --> 01:46:24.80
is it actually there's no it's like they're gaining such a closer approximation of experience

984
01:46:24.80 --> 01:46:29.36
than the person that's sitting there going oh I got to take notes so I can get do good on the

985
01:46:29.36 --> 01:46:34.32
quiz it's because they've made the connection and I remember avoiding stuff like this because

986
01:46:34.32 --> 01:46:39.36
I don't have the time for it if you actually make the connection think of how much faster it

987
01:46:39.36 --> 01:46:43.44
goes and how much easier it is to go through it when you actually make that connection to you

988
01:46:43.44 --> 01:46:48.96
and what it is you're trying to learn it's easy and the avoidance of that and the and the

989
01:46:48.96 --> 01:46:54.80
resistance to doing it is the thing that actually makes it more difficult than it needs to be

990
01:46:55.44 --> 01:46:59.84
and that's that's what I did I look like what am I going to get from this and I just resisted

991
01:46:59.84 --> 01:47:05.12
and when I remember even in college spending a couple of years in college like I'm going to do

992
01:47:05.12 --> 01:47:09.84
all this work they'll make it into this work for when I figured out that doing what I learned from

993
01:47:09.84 --> 01:47:13.84
doing the work and how much better it made me the work was 10 times easier

994
01:47:13.84 --> 01:47:21.44
making that connection putting yourself inside of that and look these books are actually

995
01:47:21.44 --> 01:47:27.12
somebody's books are really good I miss it's really good learning that are really well written

996
01:47:28.96 --> 01:47:34.56
with the old breed was the one that was the trigger for me early in my career I wasn't I was

997
01:47:34.56 --> 01:47:39.12
probably a junior captain when I was like a young captain so probably be four years in the

998
01:47:39.12 --> 01:47:44.48
Marine Corps and I read that that was one of the first big light bulbs for me was that book

999
01:47:44.48 --> 01:47:50.48
yeah sledge and just holy cow just reading that book that was one that turned me back into

1000
01:47:50.48 --> 01:47:54.96
paying it that's gotten on that that path and I don't get me wrong there are times and I

1001
01:47:54.96 --> 01:47:59.44
veered off that that book for me was a big turning point yeah and for me obviously it was about phase

1002
01:47:59.44 --> 01:48:05.04
reading for the first time and and the first time I read it I read it because it was the most

1003
01:48:05.04 --> 01:48:10.64
awesome war story or I shouldn't say the most because I you know you can't compare because with the old

1004
01:48:10.64 --> 01:48:19.68
breed hmm tough tough tough to outdo colder than hell though yeah colder than hell

1005
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:26.32
when the Marines when the wounded starving frostbitten Marines are rolling back into base camp after

1006
01:48:26.32 --> 01:48:34.64
escaping the development and somebody calls out fall in and they start marching back into

1007
01:48:34.64 --> 01:48:41.92
camp and the other Marines line up and like saludum I mean come on yeah so but about face for me

1008
01:48:42.48 --> 01:48:48.32
there's definitely the first time I read it was like an awesome war story and then the second time I

1009
01:48:48.32 --> 01:48:54.96
read it was like hmm there's there's a little bit more here there here than I originally saw

1010
01:48:55.76 --> 01:49:04.40
and then as you read it five times you go oh man that's a gem oh that oh I never my intuition

1011
01:49:04.40 --> 01:49:13.20
is completely wrong and this is clearly the right way to do it so yeah putting these putting

1012
01:49:13.20 --> 01:49:21.20
yourself into these situations is a is a way I think we'll we'll start to open the door on how to

1013
01:49:21.20 --> 01:49:27.20
read this stuff where we'll have the most benefit in the back for you yeah back to the book

1014
01:49:27.20 --> 01:49:32.24
exercise is also test the ability of units to sustain tempo for an extended period of time since

1015
01:49:32.24 --> 01:49:39.12
victory is rarely the product of single actions the ability to operate and sustain combat effectiveness

1016
01:49:39.12 --> 01:49:48.08
over time is important knowing when hostilities will cease is a convenience denied the combat

1017
01:49:48.08 --> 01:49:53.84
Marine equipment must be maintained and people must be sustained with adequate rest,

1018
01:49:53.84 --> 01:49:59.92
nourishment and hygiene until they accomplish their mission tactical exercises can range from

1019
01:49:59.92 --> 01:50:06.16
field exercises to command post exercises to tactical exercises without field troops field

1020
01:50:06.16 --> 01:50:12.48
exercises conducted by units of any size involved involve all unit personnel working together to

1021
01:50:12.48 --> 01:50:18.32
learn test and refine their collective battlefield skills such exercises can be general in nature

1022
01:50:18.32 --> 01:50:23.68
or they can be detailed rehearsals for specific upcoming missions command post exercises are largely

1023
01:50:23.68 --> 01:50:28.96
limited to commanders and their staff their purposes to familiarize the staff with their commanders

1024
01:50:28.96 --> 01:50:34.96
personnel personal preferences and operating styles as well as to exercise staff techniques and

1025
01:50:34.96 --> 01:50:40.64
procedures to review a particular to review particular contingency plans so for those of you

1026
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:46.40
don't in the military sometimes the leadership the staff can rehearse and practice and do exercises

1027
01:50:47.44 --> 01:50:54.48
as if there's a there's a there's a there move out of the field or working and even other not

1028
01:50:54.48 --> 01:51:01.44
tactical exercises without troops provide tactical leaders opportunities to exercise judgment while

1029
01:51:01.44 --> 01:51:04.64
permitting other unit elements to conduct training and education on their own

1030
01:51:07.44 --> 01:51:11.84
there are there are two approaches to conducting them the first method provides a leader an opportunity

1031
01:51:11.84 --> 01:51:17.04
to evaluate a subordinate's ability to perform in a given scenario boom scenario based training

1032
01:51:17.04 --> 01:51:23.04
role playing you don't need anybody you don't need anybody in the field you can make it happen

1033
01:51:23.04 --> 01:51:27.12
this method provides places students in an area of operations and provides a situation upon which

1034
01:51:27.12 --> 01:51:35.52
to plan an executed task for example established a reverse slope defense the aim here is to

1035
01:51:37.20 --> 01:51:41.52
exercise tactical proficiency in the sighting of weapons in the use of terrain the second method

1036
01:51:41.52 --> 01:51:47.60
also places the student in an air operations and provides a situation but gives them a mission or

1037
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:58.08
a mission order for example prevent enemy movement north of route 348 the aim here is to exercise

1038
01:51:58.08 --> 01:52:04.64
judgment after walking the ground the students must first decide whether to defend or it's

1039
01:52:04.64 --> 01:52:08.96
exporting their conclusions with reasoning the reasoning is then discussed and criticized

1040
01:52:10.16 --> 01:52:15.76
this approach encourages students to demonstrate ingenuity and initiative

1041
01:52:15.76 --> 01:52:21.92
they have free reign to employ the resources as they see fit to achieve the desired results

1042
01:52:23.12 --> 01:52:32.08
so just putting people in scenarios and then most equally important is discussing and criticizing

1043
01:52:32.08 --> 01:52:36.32
and asking people why they're doing what they're doing why they made that decision figuring out

1044
01:52:36.32 --> 01:52:41.36
how they're thinking and why they're thinking yeah that part that that last part of hey why did you do this

1045
01:52:41.36 --> 01:52:47.28
and not the why did you do this not that while you're wrong and I need to know what's your

1046
01:52:47.28 --> 01:52:52.16
you know like hey what were you seeing that made you think to do this and look if it turns out

1047
01:52:52.16 --> 01:52:57.12
that it's just tactical you mistake and you know no no no factor this stuff is free you're not

1048
01:52:57.12 --> 01:53:01.28
really moving people around you're not really spending gas none of that is happening you can do this

1049
01:53:01.28 --> 01:53:06.72
all day long but it's the leaders that actually ask hey what why are you doing that what were you

1050
01:53:06.72 --> 01:53:12.40
seeing there that you start to that's also I remember being asked as a young flight lead

1051
01:53:12.40 --> 01:53:16.16
haven't seen your flight leads more often than I is like what are you doing and you don't want

1052
01:53:16.16 --> 01:53:19.60
to answer and you're like I'm sorry I must have something good the best guys ever full with go

1053
01:53:19.60 --> 01:53:25.44
hey man what did you see there like well I saw this and that and often they weren't seeing it

1054
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.48
and that ended becoming that built my confidence up that hey it's like you described earlier

1055
01:53:31.04 --> 01:53:34.48
my brain actually is working pretty good what I lack is the confidence to take action on

1056
01:53:34.48 --> 01:53:39.12
what I see because I'm afraid he's gonna think there's something wrong with it and the takeaway

1057
01:53:39.12 --> 01:53:45.60
from this and we see with companies all the time is they think training is elaborate and training

1058
01:53:45.60 --> 01:53:50.32
requires all these things it doesn't require anything you could sit at a table like this and

1059
01:53:50.32 --> 01:53:54.16
have the conversation and if you have a strong enough relationship hey man what were you thinking

1060
01:53:54.16 --> 01:53:58.96
there when I started to figure out that my instincts were pretty good and I understood it better

1061
01:53:58.96 --> 01:54:03.28
than I thought and I started to build my confidence I started to contribute to the organization better

1062
01:54:03.28 --> 01:54:07.84
and that comes from the leaders when they say and the critique and then I was willing to be

1063
01:54:07.84 --> 01:54:11.44
criticized I wasn't defensive about being criticized I was actually listening to their point of view as

1064
01:54:11.44 --> 01:54:15.76
well it's not that hard it's just a little humility from leaders to go well would you see man why

1065
01:54:16.24 --> 01:54:21.12
that's pretty good I didn't see it like that this conversation isn't that hard

1066
01:54:22.48 --> 01:54:30.000
and they're free they're free next section war gaming war games can be a valuable tool

1067
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.48
for understanding the many factors that influence a leader's decisions morale enemy and friendly

1068
01:54:36.48 --> 01:54:42.24
situations the higher commanders intentions firepower mobility and terrain are only a few of the

1069
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:49.04
decision factors included in the play of war games in all these simulations from the sand table

1070
01:54:49.04 --> 01:54:56.32
to a commercial board game to a computerized simulation routine should be avoided

1071
01:54:56.32 --> 01:55:02.80
the less familiar the environment the more creativity the student must display sand table

1072
01:55:02.80 --> 01:55:09.36
exercises tactical decision games and map exercises present students with a general situation

1073
01:55:09.36 --> 01:55:16.40
mission orders and a minimum of information on enemy and friendly forces sand table exercises are

1074
01:55:16.40 --> 01:55:21.12
especially suited to novice tacticians they present the terrain and a three-durched

1075
01:55:21.12 --> 01:55:27.04
dimensional array whereas a map requires interpretation both map and sand table exercises and

1076
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:32.48
able students to conceptualize the battle deliver their decisions and issue orders to

1077
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:38.80
subordinates afterwards students discuss their decisions and our critique the decision the

1078
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:45.84
discussion should focus on making a decision in the absence of perfect information or complete intelligence

1079
01:55:45.84 --> 01:55:54.88
those are again these are things that are free free you can do with your business you can do with

1080
01:55:54.88 --> 01:56:00.80
your team you can do with your platoon next section terrain walks terrain walks introduce

1081
01:56:00.80 --> 01:56:06.000
the realities of terrain vegetation and weather terrain walks can be conducted in at least two ways

1082
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.88
the first method provides students with an area of operations a general situation and a mission

1083
01:56:10.88 --> 01:56:16.64
as in sand table and map exercises students describe their view of the battle choosing one plan the

1084
01:56:16.64 --> 01:56:20.80
group then begins to walk the terrain according to the plan the group will then encounter

1085
01:56:20.80 --> 01:56:25.76
to un-inticipate terrain and obstacles while the instructors introduce enemy actions into the play

1086
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:31.04
of the problem in this way students must contend with the disparity between actual terrain and

1087
01:56:31.04 --> 01:56:36.96
vegetarian vegetation and maps as well as the chaos and uncertainty generated by enemy actions

1088
01:56:36.96 --> 01:56:45.20
that invariably occur in real world operations to just think of all the ways you as a business owner can

1089
01:56:45.20 --> 01:56:51.60
employ that right there playing the bad customer playing the good customer I mean there's so many ways

1090
01:56:51.60 --> 01:56:56.40
to do this the second method involves the first hand study of historic battle fields

1091
01:56:58.32 --> 01:57:03.20
we gain a special vantage on battle by walking the ground and seeing the battle field from the

1092
01:57:03.20 --> 01:57:09.76
perspective of both commanders we gain a new appreciation for a historical commanders

1093
01:57:09.76 --> 01:57:16.16
of blunders often such blunders seem incomprehensible until we see the ground only then can we

1094
01:57:16.16 --> 01:57:21.12
realistically consider alternative courses of action that the commander might have pursued

1095
01:57:22.72 --> 01:57:28.80
an interestingly add national front right now we've kind of we're starting to prepare some

1096
01:57:28.80 --> 01:57:36.32
historical battlefield walks and terrain studies that we're going to offer up to a small number of

1097
01:57:37.44 --> 01:57:44.32
clients so that will be that'll be awesome some of the sites we're checking out right now

1098
01:57:44.32 --> 01:57:51.92
gonna be great next section competition exercises should provide realism the means to a chief tactical

1099
01:57:51.92 --> 01:58:00.80
realism our competitive free play or force on force exercises yes whenever possible

1100
01:58:00.80 --> 01:58:05.28
unit training should be conducted in a free place scenario this approach can be used by all

1101
01:58:05.28 --> 01:58:09.28
leaders to develop their support needs it affords both leaders and unit members there

1102
01:58:09.28 --> 01:58:13.84
opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge against an active threat free place in

1103
01:58:13.84 --> 01:58:18.000
area so when you're setting these up this is a this is like a little tiny thing I remember doing this

1104
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.12
so we'd have certain areas we'd be training on let's say a base somewhere and there'd be some

1105
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
area that we weren't allowed to go into you know for whatever administrative reasons hey there

1106
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:34.64
you guys don't allowed to go over there because that's the whatever and the common thing we

1107
01:58:34.64 --> 01:58:41.36
be okay guys just to add me note you're not allowed to go over there and I hated that because it

1108
01:58:41.36 --> 01:58:47.36
ruins the free place scenario puts in everyone's mind that well you know this is this is like

1109
01:58:47.36 --> 01:58:53.52
lame so I would say hey guys yeah you can go wherever you want by the way intel indicates that there's

1110
01:58:54.08 --> 01:58:59.92
IDs heavily planted in this area and then sure enough we'd plant some fake IDs right on the border

1111
01:58:59.92 --> 01:59:04.08
and they might hit one but they wouldn't continue that direction so as you're setting up scenarios

1112
01:59:04.64 --> 01:59:08.48
try and make them as realistic because there's always constraints on a real battlefield don't make

1113
01:59:08.48 --> 01:59:15.52
them admin make them real yeah what's an admin constraint like what like like like like like this

1114
01:59:15.52 --> 01:59:23.12
game does indicate that it's a game in their mind so you might have let's say we have a let's say this

1115
01:59:23.12 --> 01:59:30.000
we're going to a an urban terrain village and the army says hey this one building we got over here

1116
01:59:30.64 --> 01:59:36.40
the it's unsafe and we don't want your guys going in it and so instead of me saying okay guys

1117
01:59:36.40 --> 01:59:40.80
it's free play except for this building it's not safe so don't go in there and everyone goes

1118
01:59:40.80 --> 01:59:46.56
that's kind of lame right whereas if I say hey guys do whatever you want this building right here

1119
01:59:46.56 --> 01:59:53.60
heavily ID in tell reports indicate that it is heavily ID and if you go in there your you are

1120
01:59:53.60 --> 01:59:59.36
almost guaranteed to take a casualty and then in the doorway I put an ID right a fake ID and it's like

1121
01:59:59.36 --> 02:00:06.24
yeah so it just keeps the mindset in the game yeah we did that in aviation all the time we

1122
02:00:06.24 --> 02:00:10.000
go out to a range you know now let's remember and you'd have part of the range and some of the

1123
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.72
part you wouldn't have because another squadron was training there and most of the admin briefs were

1124
02:00:14.72 --> 02:00:18.40
hey we don't have this range and this range stay out of there because you know you're not supposed

1125
02:00:18.40 --> 02:00:23.60
to be the other guys in their training below x altitude to avoid them the good flight leads would say

1126
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:29.04
we have a Samoring here from this service to earth yes which guestwood scenario had more

1127
02:00:29.04 --> 02:00:33.76
violations of that range the one where you had a Samoring where you die in the in the mission you

1128
02:00:33.76 --> 02:00:38.08
dying get colored out and you wouldn't get the fight anymore or the admin violation they would just say

1129
02:00:38.08 --> 02:00:42.88
move to the north your in violation of the mmm and making realistic isn't that hard there's a

1130
02:00:42.88 --> 02:00:46.72
whole bunch of places we would fly all the time right you can't go there why that's a ran

1131
02:00:46.72 --> 02:00:50.16
yeah they have this system here you don't want to fly there not because it's an administrative

1132
02:00:50.16 --> 02:00:55.36
border totally and 95% of the time the one that you would violate would be you're not allowed to

1133
02:00:55.36 --> 02:00:59.52
be there why would you just not because we don't have it today and whatever okay or you put

1134
02:00:59.52 --> 02:01:05.04
it alive throughout there and guys like I'm not gonna I don't want to get killed there you go make it

1135
02:01:05.04 --> 02:01:14.08
realistic free play exercises are adaptable to all tactical scenarios and benefit beneficial

1136
02:01:14.08 --> 02:01:20.96
to all echelons whether it is fire teams scouting against fire teams sections of aircraft

1137
02:01:20.96 --> 02:01:28.24
dueling in the sky do you get a little bit he like that don't you or battalions or companies

1138
02:01:28.24 --> 02:01:33.84
battalions squadrons and marine airground task force operating against one another both leaders

1139
02:01:33.84 --> 02:01:41.04
and individual marines benefit leaders form and execute their decisions against an opposing

1140
02:01:41.04 --> 02:01:48.16
force as individual marines employ their skills against an active enemy through free play exercises

1141
02:01:48.16 --> 02:01:53.68
marines learn to fight as an organization and deal with a realistically challenging foe

1142
02:01:53.68 --> 02:02:01.76
next section is about critiques a key attribute of decision makers is their ability to reach

1143
02:02:01.76 --> 02:02:09.20
decisions with clear reasoning critiques elicit this reasoning critiques elicit this reasoning

1144
02:02:09.20 --> 02:02:14.96
process any tactical decision game or tactical exercise should culminate with a critique

1145
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.40
the standard approach for conducting critiques should be should promote initiative

1146
02:02:20.40 --> 02:02:25.28
since every tactical situation is unique and since no training situation can encompass more than a

1147
02:02:25.28 --> 02:02:31.36
small fraction of the peculiarities of a real tactical situation there can be no ideal school solution

1148
02:02:32.56 --> 02:02:38.000
critiques should focus on the students rationale for for doing what they did so there is

1149
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:43.28
he it's like you said i'm not gonna say Dave you chose this method that method was wrong

1150
02:02:44.64 --> 02:02:47.76
I mean okay are there exceptions that yeah you could do something that was

1151
02:02:47.76 --> 02:02:53.28
tactically unsound and then we talk about it but you made a decision let's talk about why you made

1152
02:02:53.28 --> 02:02:58.88
that decision what factors did a student consider or not consider in making an estimate of the

1153
02:02:58.88 --> 02:03:04.64
situation were the decisions the student made consistent with the estimate were the actions ordered

1154
02:03:04.64 --> 02:03:09.60
tactically sound did they have a reasonable chance of achieving success how well were orders

1155
02:03:09.60 --> 02:03:14.48
communicated to subordinates these questions should form the basis for critiques

1156
02:03:14.48 --> 02:03:23.12
the purpose is to broaden the leaders analytical powers experience level and base of knowledge

1157
02:03:23.12 --> 02:03:29.04
thereby increasing the students at creative ability to devise sound innovative solutions

1158
02:03:29.04 --> 02:03:35.76
to difficult problems and I used to explain to my guys when I was running training that

1159
02:03:36.40 --> 02:03:41.60
the goal was not to the goal of training was not to put their brain in a box it was to open up all

1160
02:03:41.60 --> 02:03:48.16
those doors and allow them to make decisions that they that aren't that aren't standard

1161
02:03:50.88 --> 02:03:55.68
critiques should be open-minded and understanding rather than rigid and harsh

1162
02:03:57.92 --> 02:04:02.80
I'll read that again critiques should be open-minded and understanding rather than rigid and

1163
02:04:02.80 --> 02:04:09.76
harsh this is the big tough United States Marine Corps telling everyone that your critiques should be

1164
02:04:09.76 --> 02:04:18.32
understanding yes why because mistakes are essential to the learning process and should always

1165
02:04:18.32 --> 02:04:25.68
be cast in a positive light mistakes are essential to the learning process and should always be

1166
02:04:25.68 --> 02:04:28.80
cast in a positive light imagine if you applied that to your children

1167
02:04:32.32 --> 02:04:37.84
the focus should not be on whether a leader did well or poorly but rather on the progress achieved

1168
02:04:37.84 --> 02:04:44.08
in the overall development when or learn as I talked about in war your kid you're going to win

1169
02:04:44.08 --> 02:04:49.12
or you're going to learn that's the Marine Corps saying we must aim to provide the best climate to

1170
02:04:49.12 --> 02:04:57.36
grow leaders damaging a leaders self-esteem especially in public therefore should be strictly avoided

1171
02:04:57.36 --> 02:05:02.56
and that's exactly what you talked about Dave he's talking about the good the good leaders

1172
02:05:02.56 --> 02:05:07.52
that would build your confidence but I'm sure along the way you had guys that were like

1173
02:05:07.52 --> 02:05:15.04
they'll what you do in bulk for sure look your your best tool to figure out how to not

1174
02:05:15.84 --> 02:05:20.80
make a mistake in combat is to figure out the mistakes you made in training that's the best thing

1175
02:05:20.80 --> 02:05:25.92
you can do is figure out all the things you did wrong and what that sort of relied on over time

1176
02:05:27.28 --> 02:05:30.56
what you actually wanted to get to is guys will into admit the mistakes that they made that

1177
02:05:30.56 --> 02:05:36.72
people didn't see and that's that's magnified in a single seat airplane most people didn't see a lot

1178
02:05:36.72 --> 02:05:41.36
of what I would a lot of my mistakes people didn't see or you could certainly cover them up

1179
02:05:41.36 --> 02:05:45.60
if you had a squadron where guys were willing to hey you didn't see this but I screwed this thing up

1180
02:05:45.60 --> 02:05:50.32
by myself if you get to that point now you're here to place where that squadron is literally

1181
02:05:51.20 --> 02:05:55.20
inside on the idea of hey I'm just here to make everybody better I'm I'm not afraid of admitting

1182
02:05:55.20 --> 02:06:00.000
any mistake that I made and I'd be a squadron you see that the senior guys that would just crush

1183
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.48
the junior guys and guess what they did with all those little mistakes they would hide them all all

1184
02:06:04.48 --> 02:06:08.08
those little things that you might not hear about that you're never going to see I'm not going to

1185
02:06:08.08 --> 02:06:11.84
volunteer and I'm not going to get it crushed again and you know who you're hurt and who you're doing

1186
02:06:11.84 --> 02:06:16.08
the whole team your crush on the whole team and if you can get to a point your guys are

1187
02:06:16.96 --> 02:06:22.48
offering up errors that you didn't even see now you're at a place where you know you've got a team

1188
02:06:22.48 --> 02:06:26.96
willing to to figure out all and how you I think that team's going to do in combat how do you think

1189
02:06:26.96 --> 02:06:31.68
that team's going to do in the world but yeah man all the time you go get to the way you see these

1190
02:06:31.68 --> 02:06:34.72
guys and what they really want to do is they want to look smarter in front of everybody else and

1191
02:06:34.72 --> 02:06:39.28
they're going to do it at your expense and yeah that that feels good for about 30 seconds

1192
02:06:39.28 --> 02:06:42.80
I crush this guy in public will guess what you actually hurt yourself in the long run you're

1193
02:06:42.80 --> 02:06:46.32
at the team in the long run and it's so obvious when you talk about it but it happens all the time

1194
02:06:46.32 --> 02:06:50.08
you are who looks at a leader that crushes someone in public and goes wow that was

1195
02:06:50.08 --> 02:06:57.52
it was awesome that was so cool with to your bruiser we would because when you get done with a

1196
02:06:57.52 --> 02:07:03.60
run whether it's a land warfare or urban or whatever you debrief and then the cadre debriefs you

1197
02:07:04.24 --> 02:07:10.56
and you know the cadre usually just rips task units apart but tasking a bruiser we would hammer

1198
02:07:10.56 --> 02:07:14.96
ourselves so hard that the cadre we got nothing else go get ready for another run yeah

1199
02:07:14.96 --> 02:07:22.08
and this is how they close out this little section a leader's self confidence is the well

1200
02:07:22.08 --> 02:07:29.52
spring from which flows the willingness to assume responsibility and exercise initiative

1201
02:07:30.96 --> 02:07:36.64
so every moment that you are cutting down a leader's confidence you are crushing their

1202
02:07:36.64 --> 02:07:41.28
their willingness to assume responsibility take ownership and exercise initiative

1203
02:07:41.28 --> 02:07:46.24
this is what you need them to do what you absolutely need them to do

1204
02:07:47.84 --> 02:07:50.32
crazy and here's the conclusion

1205
02:07:52.96 --> 02:07:58.32
in this publication we have explored themes that help us to understand the fundamentals and

1206
02:07:58.96 --> 02:08:06.32
to master the art and science of tactics from the study of our war fighting philosophy we have

1207
02:08:06.32 --> 02:08:12.40
gained an appreciation for their requirement to be decisive in battle to accomplish this we must

1208
02:08:12.40 --> 02:08:19.12
clearly visualize the battle space gained through gained situational awareness recognize patterns

1209
02:08:19.12 --> 02:08:26.96
and make decisions intuitively we have also discussed ways we can gain advantage over the enemy

1210
02:08:26.96 --> 02:08:34.72
and force him to bend to our will we also explored how to be faster in relation to the enemy

1211
02:08:34.72 --> 02:08:41.84
to adapt to changing conditions to cooperate for success to exploit success and to finish the

1212
02:08:41.84 --> 02:08:49.68
enemy finally we discussed how we can begin to act on these ideas during our training for combat

1213
02:08:50.88 --> 02:08:57.20
the ideas presented in this publication have implications far beyond a battle field tactics

1214
02:08:57.20 --> 02:09:02.24
and the doctrinal way we think about warfare they also influence the way we organize

1215
02:09:02.24 --> 02:09:09.44
using task organization and flexible command and control relationships and the way we equip ourselves

1216
02:09:09.44 --> 02:09:18.64
for combat weging war in maneuver warfare styled demands a professional body of officers and marines

1217
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:25.52
schooled in its science and art when asked why the marines were so successful in operation desert

1218
02:09:25.52 --> 02:09:31.68
storm general boomer replied the thing that made the big difference on the battle field is that we

1219
02:09:31.68 --> 02:09:39.84
had thousands and thousands of individual marines constantly taking the initiative the young

1220
02:09:39.84 --> 02:09:46.56
Lance Corporal would take a look see something 75 or 100 meters out in front that needed to be done

1221
02:09:46.56 --> 02:09:54.24
and go out there and do it without being told as I read through the award citations from desert

1222
02:09:54.24 --> 02:10:02.88
shield and desert storm this team reappears time and time again that aggressive spirit comes from

1223
02:10:02.88 --> 02:10:11.28
being well trained and confident in your professional knowledge and here's how they close this

1224
02:10:11.28 --> 02:10:20.48
thing out everything we do in peace time should prepare us for combat our preparation for combat

1225
02:10:20.48 --> 02:10:29.20
depends upon training and education that develop the action and fought essential to battle

1226
02:10:33.20 --> 02:10:42.64
and that wraps up MCDP one tack three tactics everything we do in peace time

1227
02:10:42.64 --> 02:10:58.56
should prepare us for combat everything and let's just take that one step further that everything

1228
02:10:58.56 --> 02:11:13.12
that you do matters it matters and I know that everyone's not necessarily preparing for combat

1229
02:11:13.12 --> 02:11:19.84
but we are actually preparing for life for the next opportunity that we are going to see and we are

1230
02:11:19.84 --> 02:11:30.64
going to see and we are going to exploit or the next obstacle or the next crisis we have to be ready

1231
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:40.56
and everything we do should prepare us for that so don't take it easy and don't slack off

1232
02:11:40.56 --> 02:11:52.96
be ready to aggressively attack or counter and get the upper hand and then be ready to exploit

1233
02:11:52.96 --> 02:12:02.16
repeatedly until you finish the enemy that's what we're doing here

1234
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:14.72
all right good review I did not think this was going to take four podcasts

1235
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:21.52
yeah what's probably eight to ten hours I guess I guess maybe around eight hours

1236
02:12:22.72 --> 02:12:29.28
but that is eight hours well spent and I hope that I hope that people listening to this

1237
02:12:29.28 --> 02:12:34.96
clearly my number one priority is I hope that the folks that are going to be going out on the front

1238
02:12:34.96 --> 02:12:41.76
lines to protect this country can get something and take something away from from this series of podcasts

1239
02:12:41.76 --> 02:12:46.80
kind of it's been awesome having you here Dave to hear your perspective from the ring core

1240
02:12:46.80 --> 02:12:52.64
to hear your perspective from just how closely these things relate air ground doesn't matter

1241
02:12:52.64 --> 02:12:57.84
it's like it's the same thing it's leadership it's tactics they're all related

1242
02:13:00.72 --> 02:13:07.04
check did you think we would go that deep no I didn't and I actually

1243
02:13:09.92 --> 02:13:16.64
I learned so much just listening to it again and that for me was probably the most fun as

1244
02:13:16.64 --> 02:13:23.12
me just sitting here hearing you say the words that I've read before a couple times and making

1245
02:13:23.12 --> 02:13:27.52
the connections to a whole bunch of things that I had made the connection on before this was I mean

1246
02:13:27.52 --> 02:13:32.88
look this was awesome for me to be here and of all the the books to be talking about

1247
02:13:32.88 --> 02:13:42.000
Marine Core Tactics that's that's good to go yeah so check echo Charles if speaking of

1248
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:48.48
being prepared for combat for life sure I know you're pretty you pretty into that

1249
02:13:51.44 --> 02:14:00.08
sure you know oh yeah you got that uh dot five oh cow desert eagle

1250
02:14:01.12 --> 02:14:09.44
sure without your first handgun that you got oh well you know technically yeah that's a good

1251
02:14:09.44 --> 02:14:16.48
I bought a bunch of them together so yeah so the first one that I paid for and signed for yeah

1252
02:14:17.68 --> 02:14:21.76
desert eagle but it came it took a while for it to come in so yeah into you know before it came in

1253
02:14:21.76 --> 02:14:27.04
I got out of the one so you know I bet it's cool to shoot that thing yeah well you do well oh yes

1254
02:14:27.04 --> 02:14:33.04
I did and it was that thing was awesome yeah preparedness that's part of your preparedness yeah very practical

1255
02:14:33.04 --> 02:14:39.12
um because I also have a refrigerator so you know someone attacks me they hide behind the refrigerator

1256
02:14:39.68 --> 02:14:43.60
boom I'm prepared you seem saying oh because you got the desert eagle and shoot through the

1257
02:14:43.60 --> 02:14:48.40
refrigerator penetration that you need in pretty in-house scenario you know scenario what if you

1258
02:14:48.40 --> 02:14:55.20
don't ever weapon what can you use the uh okay so and I think about this too a lot not a lot

1259
02:14:55.20 --> 02:15:00.24
we'll just say some of the time where yes you can you can be prepared with weapons most of the time

1260
02:15:00.24 --> 02:15:04.72
you're thinking about like if you're talking about what you think about a lot it's like Hawaii five

1261
02:15:04.72 --> 02:15:14.000
long you know Mario brothers no not Mario brothers yes nonetheless you can be prepared with some

1262
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:22.16
one called you echo nonetheless Charles yeah yeah and that's what you want that's that's a quasi

1263
02:15:22.16 --> 02:15:27.04
important point too because I don't say nevertheless some people try to tease me and be like oh yeah

1264
02:15:27.04 --> 02:15:31.60
you see you never really less but I don't say never less but I'm not really cares I don't

1265
02:15:31.60 --> 02:15:38.16
want to spare anyway like I was trying to say you can be prepared with weapons desert eagle or

1266
02:15:38.16 --> 02:15:47.52
otherwise but what if you like don't have ammo the weapon fails or you simply don't have the weapons

1267
02:15:47.52 --> 02:15:53.20
I know like we're encouraged to have your tools on you at all times I get it but are they on

1268
02:15:53.20 --> 02:15:59.92
you at all times they should be yeah but let's say you're in the shower let's say you're picking

1269
02:15:59.92 --> 02:16:05.60
up your kids from school no guns on what if you're in there playing check yep there you go

1270
02:16:05.60 --> 02:16:10.32
during the airport past security you seem saying to your good scenario anyway it's possible

1271
02:16:10.32 --> 02:16:15.60
it's one I'm saying so then what do you have and I'm not saying like you need to be bruisedly

1272
02:16:15.60 --> 02:16:21.68
uh a hoist graysie or something like this but don't have nothing don't go from level 10

1273
02:16:21.68 --> 02:16:28.16
prepared to level zero in one pass of the security check point you seem saying so what can you have

1274
02:16:29.20 --> 02:16:36.88
you get out the jujitsu it's true it's absolutely true anyway so yes we're going to jitsu and

1275
02:16:36.88 --> 02:16:44.16
the good part about this is like this preparedness taking jitsu is fun beneficial health wise

1276
02:16:45.36 --> 02:16:50.16
and also therapeutic so mentally fun is or mentally uh produces did you see the big fight it

1277
02:16:50.16 --> 02:16:56.000
there's new world negative Disney land did you see it it was on youtube yeah oh like a fight

1278
02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.20
yeah big fight big man oh but at some point some some dude just walks up and puts a dude

1279
02:17:01.20 --> 02:17:04.64
to sleep and then walks away yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1280
02:17:04.64 --> 02:17:10.08
in cognito walks up behind him puts him to sleep lesm down walks away yeah so that's

1281
02:17:10.08 --> 02:17:14.96
that's that's that's one month of jitsu because I'm sitting here thinking you hear the argument

1282
02:17:14.96 --> 02:17:20.48
well you know it's I don't have too much time to invest and how good can I really get like

1283
02:17:20.48 --> 02:17:25.84
you train for a month and you can put someone to sleep oh yeah train for one month just two

1284
02:17:25.84 --> 02:17:30.64
times a week and and I'm not saying you will you'll be effective against another jitsu you're not

1285
02:17:30.64 --> 02:17:34.56
saying you're not gonna be but you compare yourself to the guy who doesn't know any jitsu which is a

1286
02:17:34.56 --> 02:17:39.36
lot of people and the years the question when are you going to be attacked it might be in a month

1287
02:17:39.36 --> 02:17:44.32
but it might be in two years and two years you could be that much more prepared for the situation

1288
02:17:44.32 --> 02:17:50.40
and on top of all that benefit of just this pure self defense aspect you got in better condition

1289
02:17:51.12 --> 02:17:57.68
and you brought into your view of the world you became a better human being your perspective is

1290
02:17:57.68 --> 02:18:07.20
better you see the thread in all things yes you will so we're doing jitsu by the way oh yeah

1291
02:18:07.20 --> 02:18:13.92
speak to and it makes sense when people go in the first day second day and they get addicted because they see the

1292
02:18:13.92 --> 02:18:19.20
power whether it's demonstrated on them or if you just look I have a six year old daughter currently

1293
02:18:19.20 --> 02:18:25.12
she's six so I'm not saying to do this but I'm saying this is an example of how it can be kind of

1294
02:18:25.12 --> 02:18:29.76
fun and empowering so I thought her the real naked joke it's fun to do that if you teach kids who are

1295
02:18:29.76 --> 02:18:33.68
responsible with it you don't need them going to school and choking out everybody I understand

1296
02:18:33.68 --> 02:18:38.16
actually you need them not doing that yes correct you have to explain to them that this is not for school

1297
02:18:38.16 --> 02:18:44.96
unless it's a serious self defense yes and there's a whole you know protocol with that but so we're

1298
02:18:44.96 --> 02:18:50.80
at a party on koi and you know we're like hey you know you're still we're talking about this

1299
02:18:50.80 --> 02:18:55.20
talking about that and my daughter she wants to demonstrate their rear naked joke and most people

1300
02:18:55.20 --> 02:18:58.88
if they don't know about their rear naked joke they're like oh my god you're six you know you're

1301
02:18:58.88 --> 02:19:05.28
not gonna yeah exactly right and so like alright well just let her put it on you and you know

1302
02:19:05.28 --> 02:19:11.28
like if you can resist it cool man you're right and the cheap one someone to sleep no the thing is you

1303
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:17.84
you know when you're going to sleep even I mean how's this my wife's nephew put my wife's brother

1304
02:19:17.84 --> 02:19:25.04
to sleep before but he was like 14, 15 years old but nonetheless so these kids or even adults

1305
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:30.88
whatever they'll learn these these moves first day and they'll become addicted because they know the power

1306
02:19:30.88 --> 02:19:37.04
the power that a 66 year old can get in one day by the way nine one day 20 minutes really

1307
02:19:38.08 --> 02:19:42.80
and they have the potential to put in adult to sleep crazy whether it is a crazy man or

1308
02:19:42.80 --> 02:19:47.44
other about yes sir so one you're trained to do so you're gonna need a key if you're doing gear

1309
02:19:47.44 --> 02:19:54.32
or a minky and no key so if you're doing gear when you're doing gear get a origin gear from originmaid.com

1310
02:19:54.32 --> 02:20:01.20
made in America made in America best geese 100% by far factually yeah and maybe you're a patriotic

1311
02:20:01.20 --> 02:20:11.84
person maybe you just like to support the economy in this country well years ago they took the economy

1312
02:20:11.84 --> 02:20:19.68
away from main they took it away yeah they sold it overseas we are bringing it back so if you want

1313
02:20:19.68 --> 02:20:27.36
to train geet to and you want to at the same time support the economy of our country go to origin

1314
02:20:27.36 --> 02:20:33.20
main and if you aren't training geet to or you're gonna train geet to and you got an origin

1315
02:20:33.20 --> 02:20:41.76
gear but you don't want to wear that gear to the store because you want because you don't want to be

1316
02:20:41.76 --> 02:20:46.80
that guy right where you get the store have you ever want to get to a store negative not even I have

1317
02:20:46.80 --> 02:20:53.84
not either I saw kid with the he kids with the door my daughters my youngest daughter has worn

1318
02:20:53.84 --> 02:20:58.48
her gear actually I think all my kids have worn my kids have worn their geets straight up out

1319
02:20:58.48 --> 02:21:02.64
to dinner you know and they were little kids and stuff just bringing them from the streets to

1320
02:21:02.64 --> 02:21:08.32
their district wearing their geets the whole geek belt tied everything you know not gonna disrespect

1321
02:21:08.32 --> 02:21:13.04
that geek but yeah my little daughter even right now I mean she's 10 but you know if we're going to

1322
02:21:13.04 --> 02:21:18.40
go grab some food afterwards after jiu jitsu class we might you know she might be in her geet no

1323
02:21:18.40 --> 02:21:27.20
fact I know that kind of that kind of improves their it improves their posture yeah yeah when they're

1324
02:21:27.20 --> 02:21:33.76
wearing a geet oh yeah they're kind of got that that that that could be the proved self esteem

1325
02:21:33.76 --> 02:21:37.68
yeah when they're wearing that geet yeah in their mind they're walking around they're like hey

1326
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:43.60
they see what I'm wearing yeah there's no mistake they see what I'm wearing basically I'm training

1327
02:21:44.16 --> 02:21:47.84
I'm over here training what are you doing that's my little 10 year old daughter's walking around

1328
02:21:47.84 --> 02:21:52.72
saying it's good it's not saying it verbally but given that implicit message to the world

1329
02:21:52.72 --> 02:21:59.36
I'm over here training what are you doing it don't sense of it looks like all right so yeah

1330
02:21:59.36 --> 02:22:04.08
if you don't if you don't want to wear your geek you can wear jeans should have jeans at origin

1331
02:22:05.36 --> 02:22:11.84
we have t-shirts at origin and we have supplements at origin to help your

1332
02:22:12.88 --> 02:22:18.80
physical and mental and cognitive power preparedness

1333
02:22:18.80 --> 02:22:26.32
yeah yeah so so krill oil joint warfare these are for your joints and general health

1334
02:22:26.32 --> 02:22:31.76
because you know you're cumin that's in joint warfare so this anti-inflammatory stuff

1335
02:22:31.76 --> 02:22:35.36
and they're really good stuff this will keep you in the game physically like your joint

1336
02:22:35.36 --> 02:22:39.36
like man and again I said this before where you know when you think supplements were

1337
02:22:39.36 --> 02:22:44.56
thinking creatine um state jacked you know implement gains because there's a supplements

1338
02:22:44.56 --> 02:22:49.44
based the bait this is what I think you've been trying to say for the last three years or however long

1339
02:22:50.80 --> 02:22:57.84
the the foundational supplementation should be focused on joint health yeah you know what that's

1340
02:22:57.84 --> 02:23:03.28
like so and I might have said this before maybe maybe not whatever but it's true I might have been

1341
02:23:03.28 --> 02:23:08.08
not a listening to you yeah so you wouldn't really know yes yes I get it and you're not wrong

1342
02:23:08.08 --> 02:23:13.92
on now but this is still correct it's like when you take these creatine protein things it can be

1343
02:23:13.92 --> 02:23:18.64
looked at is it like this if you don't take the foundational joint or joint stuff that'll keep you

1344
02:23:18.64 --> 02:23:23.36
in the game capable of overpower no it's like you're watering like if you have a plant or

1345
02:23:23.36 --> 02:23:29.20
tree it's like you're watering the leaves you seem saying no you water the roots the roots allow

1346
02:23:29.20 --> 02:23:33.92
anything to grow on top there and then it's gonna be you know based on hard work and discipline

1347
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:37.92
and consistency all that stuff but you water the roots the roots are strong right you're going to

1348
02:23:37.92 --> 02:23:44.88
stay in the game same thing with your joints 100% Dave last time you talked about the discipline go

1349
02:23:45.92 --> 02:23:54.40
pill which I know you take prior to to quote you from last time prior to anything but I also know

1350
02:23:54.40 --> 02:24:04.88
that you pound quite a bit of the discipline pre-op powder drink dude you hammer that stuff

1351
02:24:04.88 --> 02:24:12.80
the go and all forms has become my go to supplement use it everywhere I do and you know we

1352
02:24:12.80 --> 02:24:19.52
are kind of kidding around I'm I'm dead serious if I want to be in the game mentally which I do

1353
02:24:19.52 --> 02:24:25.68
for kind of everything other than watching TV right because we don't need to be in the

1354
02:24:25.68 --> 02:24:31.12
good right we'll be honest with you no watching TV no I'm in full agreement watching TV for me

1355
02:24:31.12 --> 02:24:37.60
which is a relatively rare event that's a but that's a social obligation no I was gonna say not

1356
02:24:37.60 --> 02:24:42.72
to go into your personal life but you were telling me the other day when you watch TV it is not for you

1357
02:24:42.72 --> 02:24:47.44
it is it is it is for your family it is it's okay we're gonna watch it's gonna be like yeah

1358
02:24:47.44 --> 02:24:52.16
absolutely cool I'll sit down and watch this and I'll for me it's like time to sleep it is yeah

1359
02:24:52.16 --> 02:24:57.84
power nap I will sleep to I take my kids to movies my wife and I will take her kids movies

1360
02:24:57.84 --> 02:25:03.04
I have a 100% success rate of sleeping through a majority of these movies all right well

1361
02:25:03.04 --> 02:25:08.000
I'm gonna miss out on the whole movie important question that are you gonna take discipline go

1362
02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.88
or otherwise when you're watching the new top gun movie oh this is a whole situation there's

1363
02:25:14.88 --> 02:25:20.08
a very strong chance that I will because that will probably be the first movie not just because

1364
02:25:20.08 --> 02:25:25.60
I want to see what happens because I am sure I'm gonna get 10 or more questions about that movie

1365
02:25:25.60 --> 02:25:30.32
and the completion of it and I want to know are you is it like what accuracy question

1366
02:25:30.32 --> 02:25:34.08
you're not in or did you advise it on it or anything maybe

1367
02:25:36.48 --> 02:25:40.64
all right so you're kind of in it maybe I'm not in it you won't see me

1368
02:25:41.28 --> 02:25:46.000
we won't see my name in the credits but are you asking me if I was involved in it maybe

1369
02:25:46.88 --> 02:25:51.20
we were all the sudden he's doing top secret missions for Hollywood over here the only reason I

1370
02:25:51.20 --> 02:25:54.40
would say maybe is that I wouldn't be able to a lot I wouldn't be allowed to tell you a

1371
02:25:54.40 --> 02:26:01.04
base on a win I contributed to that movie oh yeah so he'd be allowed to no he could tell you

1372
02:26:01.04 --> 02:26:07.44
but then you'd have to kill you no I tell him that's a line from top one the main original

1373
02:26:07.44 --> 02:26:13.76
it's classified right yeah anyway so yes this win go while watching the new top

1374
02:26:13.76 --> 02:26:17.84
gun it's called Maverick by the way and I don't want to be engaged in something I'm taking

1375
02:26:17.84 --> 02:26:22.72
go who are you which is basically every waking hour of my work day and not when I'm

1376
02:26:22.72 --> 02:26:29.36
watching TV yeah because that's sort of the thing that I was getting to is you know you might drink

1377
02:26:30.96 --> 02:26:36.32
hey I'm thirsty I'm gonna have a glass of water hey I'm thirsty I'm gonna eat a coke or

1378
02:26:36.32 --> 02:26:42.000
a sprite if you're a human if you're a person that doesn't care about getting after it but

1379
02:26:42.56 --> 02:26:47.20
if you're a person that does care about getting after it you can be like oh I'm kind of thirsty

1380
02:26:47.20 --> 02:26:51.68
I'm gonna have some discipline go and I'm just gonna get up on step and I'm gonna stay there

1381
02:26:51.68 --> 02:26:58.000
yes because there's no overlap load of caffeine by the way there's no there's very little caffeine

1382
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
15 milligrams per scoop yeah and it doesn't take much too you don't need to be pounding

1383
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.56
five six cans of it it doesn't take much to get on the step yeah I'm with so there's a lot

1384
02:27:06.56 --> 02:27:13.52
you there if you do need protein then you can get some from milk which is milk

1385
02:27:14.72 --> 02:27:19.76
disguised as protein well actually this protein in the form of a dessert yeah

1386
02:27:19.76 --> 02:27:25.12
and so you can check that out we keep talking about how good it is and yes it is that good

1387
02:27:25.12 --> 02:27:31.28
and warrior kid milk you can get for the childrens that you may or may not have formulated

1389
02:27:39.52 --> 02:27:46.000
cold in the summertime so there you go that's origin made.com also jocco as a store it's called

1393
02:28:05.92 --> 02:28:11.60
recommendations for dry fit I gotta dry fit who recommended that that you finally because I've

1394
02:28:11.60 --> 02:28:16.80
been asking you that for 14 years before I even knew you I was asking you that and you know what

1395
02:28:16.80 --> 02:28:24.24
that's before you yeah well and I get it and you were you were right and here's here's why I'm

1396
02:28:24.24 --> 02:28:30.72
arriving to that conclusion even on an emotional level okay so one of our friends and I wish I could

1397
02:28:30.72 --> 02:28:39.60
divulge no I wish I could remember his name he gave me a dry fit sure representing his team and it's

1398
02:28:39.60 --> 02:28:44.88
like it's it's a cool it's a red one so I'm like oh yeah cool I'd really wear dry fit but hey man cool

1399
02:28:44.88 --> 02:28:49.92
so one day I put it on and I was like man this thing is good like it fits good it like feels good

1400
02:28:49.92 --> 02:28:53.60
lighter it's like breeze yeah I was like man I could wear it so then another time when it

1401
02:28:53.60 --> 02:28:59.52
worked out in it and I'm like okay that's why I became a believer in the dry fit I always thought

1402
02:28:59.52 --> 02:29:05.28
they just didn't look good or something like I don't know they thought they didn't look good yeah

1403
02:29:05.28 --> 02:29:12.72
check see that's the big difference between you and me I go form over I go I go function first

1404
02:29:12.72 --> 02:29:19.12
and you go looks well yes yeah oh kind of like I'm white men can't jump remember that movie

1405
02:29:19.12 --> 02:29:24.80
I remember that you'd rather look good and lose than the other you know I'll just look bad and

1406
02:29:24.80 --> 02:29:30.64
win or something like that Woody Hart Harold's in check kind of like that anyway so yes I'm like

1412
02:30:04.64 --> 02:30:10.80
so that your little kids are just aligned with your thought process isn't that a nice thing

1413
02:30:11.76 --> 02:30:21.60
Dave your kids do your kids absorb do let me think of a way to write answers this

1414
02:30:21.60 --> 02:30:29.68
ask this correctly without being offensive do your kids listen to Uncle Jake or you which one gets

1415
02:30:29.68 --> 02:30:39.28
the higher priority the the the question is is they listen to both but the success rate that Uncle

1416
02:30:39.28 --> 02:30:46.16
Jake has is significantly higher yeah that's what I would say I can't do this experiment with my

1417
02:30:46.16 --> 02:30:54.32
kids because my kids don't differentiate between these these things they just they're just you know

1418
02:30:54.96 --> 02:30:58.96
they that's what they get so your youngest when she first heard the word kipod guess you're like

1419
02:30:58.96 --> 02:31:04.32
ask Uncle Jake and you'd be like brother that's just you yeah yeah she knows what's behind the curtain

1420
02:31:04.32 --> 02:31:12.08
are you sure you know noree sure so or someone said to someone asked noree is a female

1421
02:31:12.08 --> 02:31:19.68
black belt that we have at the gym and and someone was a and she mean we spent a lot of

1422
02:31:19.68 --> 02:31:24.64
time on the map for the last 10 years or whatever and so and I've given her I gave her some advice

1423
02:31:24.64 --> 02:31:30.56
over the years right the counseling sessions about things and it's worked out really well for her

1424
02:31:31.60 --> 02:31:36.96
and anyways someone else asked her a question and she was answering it and the person goes

1425
02:31:36.96 --> 02:31:42.56
got you you sound just like jockel podcast and noree because I don't listen to jockel podcast

1426
02:31:43.76 --> 02:31:46.72
you know then she told me that story and I said well you don't listen to jockel podcast you

1427
02:31:46.72 --> 02:31:52.56
listen to me you listen you've been already hearing this stuff for 10 years so there you go

1428
02:31:53.28 --> 02:32:00.000
so the the children sometimes it's it's a little bit of a hit on the ego because you think well

1429
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:05.60
I want my kid to listen to me yeah but you know what I want my kid I want my kid to listen to someone

1430
02:32:05.60 --> 02:32:09.92
that's making sense yeah it's only hit on your ego if it's more important they listen to you

1431
02:32:09.92 --> 02:32:12.32
then for them to be successful yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1432
02:32:12.32 --> 02:32:16.32
like oh they're gonna go win good to go yeah yeah we came from yeah I would rather that's like what

1433
02:32:16.32 --> 02:32:21.60
do you just said echo I would rather my kids listen to me and lose then listen to someone else

1434
02:32:21.60 --> 02:32:26.24
and win so we got to watch out for that don't forget about the warrior kid sop's Irish oaks

1435
02:32:26.24 --> 02:32:33.68
ranch dot com were young aiden is making soap on a farm in California we use that soap you can

1436
02:32:33.68 --> 02:32:40.000
stay clean you youtube channel yeah we do have a youtube channel if you're interested in the video

1437
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:48.000
version of this podcast if you want to see how much Dave Burke looks like Tom Cruise yeah

1438
02:32:48.40 --> 02:32:54.88
which is not zero like there's some overlap there there is what's the overlap there I don't

1439
02:32:54.88 --> 02:33:03.44
all they're hair they're the same hair you're taller I think you got you know yeah that's all good

1440
02:33:03.44 --> 02:33:09.28
so you can check out what Dave you can also look at the videos that echo's super proud of

1441
02:33:10.24 --> 02:33:14.72
overly proud of then you can put the comments on those things and he reads him I read him

1442
02:33:15.76 --> 02:33:20.40
I read the little comments on there usually someone writes echo's jacked

1443
02:33:20.40 --> 02:33:28.80
yep I've uh and someone else writes echo's can you yeah there is no yeah and take the good

1444
02:33:28.80 --> 02:33:32.80
in the bad I'm not saying I read the comments not saying I don't read the comments you

1445
02:33:32.80 --> 02:33:40.32
definitely I am saying from time to time when I do read a comment across various platforms

1446
02:33:40.32 --> 02:33:48.96
I will say this when someone does say echo is or looks jacked the number of a's and jack has

1447
02:33:48.96 --> 02:33:56.000
been steadily increasing so that being you're getting more jacked so I posted I posted a couple

1448
02:33:58.24 --> 02:34:07.20
things on on the gram yeah the Instagram and I was reading those comments those comments are

1449
02:34:07.20 --> 02:34:16.24
almost worth reading allowed some of them were so funny especially when I made a salad on Instagram

1450
02:34:16.24 --> 02:34:21.28
in three minutes it takes three minutes to make this salad and the some of the comments that

1451
02:34:21.28 --> 02:34:28.32
people were making about I can't believe you eat chicken from a can you had to come in and

1452
02:34:28.32 --> 02:34:33.92
give me fire support on that one well yeah I saw a bit yeah so yeah those those were uh

1453
02:34:33.92 --> 02:34:38.24
those were funny I think I might make a little I think I might make a little video of me reading

1454
02:34:38.24 --> 02:34:42.72
some of those comments I was laughing out loud when I was reading those comments yeah yeah those yeah

1455
02:34:42.72 --> 02:34:49.44
very good one like that drinking milk oh yeah dairy it's like I was drinking it's like I was drinking

1456
02:34:49.44 --> 02:34:55.52
formaldehyde I mean it was just some people were just getting crazy but I like that some people were

1457
02:34:55.52 --> 02:35:02.96
just so super still I meant and that sounds cool man yeah and I mixed my I mixed my salad dressing

1458
02:35:02.96 --> 02:35:09.36
in a used water bottle yeah you mix a lot of stuff in the use I know I'm pro used but people

1459
02:35:09.36 --> 02:35:17.52
like you know some people were like there's my PA yeah you got it you're gonna die I'm like

1460
02:35:17.52 --> 02:35:23.52
dude take it easy yeah you know that that's a good the here's the thing they'll overall

1461
02:35:23.52 --> 02:35:28.72
if those things get in them this is for real like how quick you made a set because I make a salad

1462
02:35:28.72 --> 02:35:34.48
similar to that like just super basic and blah blah where some people they think wait you make a

1463
02:35:34.48 --> 02:35:38.80
salad every day like probably making a salad is a big deal you got a chop up the thing and

1464
02:35:38.80 --> 02:35:43.68
this boom it's the full gourmet thing it's right yeah not even yeah three minutes three minutes

1465
02:35:43.68 --> 02:35:50.32
right and then guess what I did I did have the can of chicken open pre-opened there you go three

1466
02:35:50.32 --> 02:35:55.20
minutes 10 seconds easy money but no because most people they're like oh wait I have

1467
02:35:55.20 --> 02:36:00.08
don't have time whatever so what are they gonna make a freaking hot pocket in the freaking microwave

1468
02:36:00.08 --> 02:36:04.96
you know which is horrible for yeah is that worse than salad dressing mix than a water bottle I think

1469
02:36:04.96 --> 02:36:09.36
yes in can chicken yeah man so and that's really the point right there it's like oh yeah

1470
02:36:09.36 --> 02:36:14.32
I didn't imagine you were in space video yeah and people were like you're gonna get

1471
02:36:14.32 --> 02:36:19.84
carpal whatever that's a tunnel and someone else in your posture is gonna break down I mean wait

what does it mean to be a man right keep fair enough question and I said oh it's not an easy

1487
02:37:45.36 --> 02:37:50.08
question to answer and a quick interview but I wrote a book about it it's called way of the warrior

1488
02:37:50.08 --> 02:37:55.76
kid in fact of written in a whole series about it it's about what it means to be a man what it

1489
02:37:55.76 --> 02:38:02.48
means to be a person because there's girls and boys that read that book and the lessons are how

1490
02:38:02.48 --> 02:38:08.80
to live a good life as a human being so you might want to check those out and then Mikey

in the dragons how old is your youngest five how does Mikey in the dragons come across

1492
02:38:15.84 --> 02:38:21.52

spending more time with uh order kid now because he's getting older you know what he holds

1494
02:38:27.28 --> 02:38:35.28

1495
02:38:35.28 --> 02:38:43.12
got a sword I like all the little notes I get and of whatever the fear was you know it's like

1496
02:38:43.12 --> 02:38:48.56
and I told him to be like Mikey and face the dragons and he stood up and jumped in the pool or he

1497
02:38:48.56 --> 02:38:54.32
stood up and got up on stage or whatever the case maybe so yeah Mikey in the dragons my
