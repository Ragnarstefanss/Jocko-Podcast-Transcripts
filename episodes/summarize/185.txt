I know, as far as the work went, like I was as far as like, like, being a seal and working there, like that, that was awesome, you know, and I was, you know, one of the biggest, like, I say concerns I had or not are even not concerned was just like a question to myself was, you know, what, what, how am I actually going to react and combat, you know, I mean, because everyone likes to think that they're ideally, you know, in a situation of shit popped off, you know, I'll be the, I'll be the guy who will, you know, hold my, have my shit together and and be that, you know, the rock or whatever, you know, I mean, and some people crumble, you know, and I saw that as a seal, like that, that was kind of my, I was always a realist, you know, was like, I've never been shot at. and like, you know, it was, it was just super frustrating to me, like, it was super frustrating to me, dealing with like the politics involved with war, and, you know, I felt like we absolutely could have done things to give us more of an advantage, but it seemed like they were more concerned with politics and shit like that, you know, as more than more than like the safety of us, and I just felt like we could, you know, there's no reason why we should be going out in the daylight period, you know, we train, like, why not fight like we train, and, oh, because you guys got locked down from doing stuff at night, right? it's super cool and the supplement in a company, but now that I've been in it for a little while, like, I'm starting to get more understanding of it and, and we're, we're doing pre-workout, protein, BCA's, all that stuff like kind of expanding it and, and, you know, now I'm like really involved with it and, and I'm just treating it like everything else, like I always tried to, you know, under promise and over deliver and like I always want to make sure that like people are getting, like, or something good, you know, I don't want to ever feel like I jipped someone or got one over, something like that. No, I didn't start training at one of the academies until after Afghanistan, I came back and because one of the guys, one of my like my see that he was, he was a purple belt at the time and we would roll on occasion, you know, and he would be like, and he would tell me like, man, you have like great, you know, aggression and ability and all this shit, but you got to go to an academy and learn, you know, and I had only learned just from that guy that dude beat my ass over and over and he would literally like just just fucking get on top pressure, grind, arm triangle, you know, and he'd be like, all right, man, you know, I got on top, you know, I fucking arm triangle, I squeezed like that. And, uh, and like I said, like going to get our air drop, it was just a lot of work, too, because not only it was like we were sealed bees, you know, we had to like build our, we had to like build our camp and also like all the stuff that came with that, like, going and getting our, our supplies that would air drop in and, and being out there, you know, you only get ring routes and stuff, you only get air drops every once in a while. And, you know, it's like always, like all the water bottle palettes are fine, but it's that one with like the goodies, you know, it's like, oh man, you know, that's the one that burned in and it just fucking hits the ground explodes and you see like all the rippets or something, you know, something that people are looking forward to just explode and you're like, fuck. And so I think that it was good that guys were doing that, but I didn't think that it was operationally focused enough, you know, like, I don't think that you should be training combatives and PT gear, you know, like I had my, like the program that I set up was all scenario driven and it was all like trained like you fight, you know, so in your, in your camis and your boots with your gear, you know, because handling someone and PT gear versus handling someone and, you know, a full kit is totally different as well. And you're going to have to deal with human beings and, you know, anything from just marshaling them to a full-on fight for your life is combatives related, you know, so I covered all of that in my program and I really focused on basic, simple things that you could remember during a time of stress, you know, like, you're not going to remember 12 steps to an arm bar, something like that when you're in a situation and you need it, you know what I mean, especially in a combative situation overseas, like that's, your adrenaline's going to be going like crazy, it's going to be fast, you need something simple effective and that, you know, that you can remember easily. and, you know, and on the west coast, I felt like, yeah, from what I had seen, going out there and working with those guys, it was a lot of, uh, I felt like more guys were interested in combatives, but there was more of like a sporty kind of thing, like they're up in the fight room, doing jujitsu and stuff like that and which, which I thought was great, like I said, it's better, it's definitely better to, to, you know, have it not needed, then need it not have it. Because I, I kind of was kind of pissed off at like, America, like, like, not America as a whole, but like, I felt like the politics, you know, like I said earlier, I felt like they really cared more about, or they just didn't really give a shit about our safety. I want to, I want to help people and stuff like that and, and do what I can, um, to help these people out and, and if they're getting like bully, essentially by the, by the Taliban or whatever, like, that's not cool, but I just felt like it was, it was really weird to be there and go there with that mindset and then have to fucking like try to help people and then when you try to help people, they don't want your help and, you know, and they fucking shoot at you and, and shit like that. Like, I was ranked number one on the East Coast and two weight classes, you know, and I was like, I'm pretty good at this shit, like, you know, and I don't understand why we don't utilize this, you utilize me as a recruiting tool, you know, go to the fight, set up a fucking pull-up bar, hand out t-shirts and try and hand, you know, or go to the, they had me go to the national, uh, high school wrestling contest or tournament, and they had me do like a combatives demonstration and and had me go out there and wrestle with all the, the high school students and stuff. But my argument to it was like, all the time was like, like, just same one with the skydiving, you know, like, guys fucking skydive all the time, there's leap frogs, you know, why not, why don't the navy, why doesn't the navy use me as a recruiting tool, you know, like, I, I would, I don't want to get out of the teams. And so that was, that was definitely when it happened and I, you know, and I did, I, I stepped up and, and felt very pleased with how that all went down and, and all the combat and everything that I had been involved with, like, that was definitely, um, rewarding to me, you know, like as a seal and, and as a man, just, and as a warrior, just like, okay, like, I felt legit, you know, I felt like fulfilled in that sense. And at the time, like, I was already been a seal for a while and, and, you know, I got to experience a ton and life and just, in war and, and just that whole lifestyle and that whole thing and, and, uh, I was just out of crossroads, you know, and I was like, well, I can stay in and make a career out of this, like I was planning on doing, I was planning on staying in for 20 years, um, and, you know, I can screen and, you know, try and make it over there and, or I can get out and kind of pursue this and, and at the time I was 29 or, yeah, Took a little break, but it was like, bittersweet, you know, go home for fucking two weeks and like, oh, I've just been playing in this mine field where everyone's trying to kill me for the last six months and come home for two weeks and like to normal see and you're just like, you know, literally just fly straight from there, know decompression or anything And then even amongst seals, I felt like only the ones who who had to live so shitty, like we did, like our platoon, you know, no running water for a year and like, like, just living in that environment was super rough. And then just seeing that kind of shit, like, I don't know, I just, I felt like before I had gone over overseas, I was like real, like, thank you for your service to everyone I saw, you know, and, and afterwards, I was just kind of the opposite. And um, by the end of it, by the end of it, uh, I remember when the ring route came to pick me up to go out, uh, I remember flying away from from the base that we were at and just thinking like, I felt kind of sad, like like almost like when you move away from somewhere and like I've moved my whole life, I moved around a lot. So that was like kind of like, it was bittersweet and uh, got back over there, but that was cool too because it was like, all right, I'm fucking halfway through like, it's downhill now, you know, so that it kind of definitely fired me up to finish out, but then uh, towards the end and we were there for all four seasons. And it's, you know, one that the reason I liked jiu-jitsu specifically was because it was like a deadly martial art, you know, I could fucking choke you and like you're tapping, you're asking me, like please don't kill me, you know, and that's what I thought was fucking cool about it. And like, which is different, like I would say, or I feel like in like, Ramadi, it was like a different, just way different environment, um, but yeah. It felt like a... like a new... like a new chapter because, like, you know, the... the... Seal Team 1, 3 and 5, or 7 or right by the Buds compound. And but I'd always looked at those guys like they were kind of superhuman or like, like it was like the NFL of fighting, like those guys are genetic freaks or whatever. Like everyone in his phone, you know, they rip apart their shit and like every one of his contacts are bad, you know, like this guy's definitely an IED maker, you know, whatever. And it just kind of made it, it had a like a shift or like a realization, like, these are just people just like you and, and they just fucking stuck with fighting and practiced it until they were good enough to beat, you know, the competition and now they're here. And, uh, I was like, well, if I, if I just keep down this road, I, I don't want to think like, what if or like regret, you know, and I was like, I've already been on this path for a while and, and it's cool and all that, but I want to see what else I can do. So I wasn't sure if like we were going to touch gloves or not, you know, because it's always kind of a, I feel like they should just like make that a rule like you are. And, you know, and, like, physically I was doing, like, a lot better than some guys who, like I said, it was kind of just like, You know, so I got kind of lucky in the fact that, you know, even talking to the guys that were new guys on that deployment to a body, they, they just kind of, they were like, from then on, they be saying, damn, you know, I thought that's what every deployment was going to be like. And, um, I was like, you know, fighting this kind of a young man's game and, uh, like you read earlier in the beginning of this, like, you can't, you can't even pause time, you know, wait for no one. Yeah, stuff just don't skip, you know, like my, my, my end game is not to make the most profit, like I want an actual good fucking product, like that, my name's behind, you know, and I proud of. Of course, in the close, you know, like, using like, if you were getting a street fight, like you can use clothes like a ghee. Like you think you really, like, no, when you're 18, you really, like, you're like, man, you know, you look back at when you're 10. And honestly, like, I didn't even know, like we were, we were, we were recordgile with each other, like at Wands and stuff like that. Yeah, I'm triggered by civilians, and, and that, that just happened all the, all of the day I'm time, and, and we would, we would, you know, we would, we would aid the wounded and stuff like that, and they would like get pissed at us, and we're like, we didn't plant that shit, you know?
