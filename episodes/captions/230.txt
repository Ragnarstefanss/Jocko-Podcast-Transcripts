[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 230 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening. Operation Rolling Thunder began in 1968. As we flew combat missions striking
[00:00:16] Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's hand-selected targets, we lost planes and men almost every day.
[00:00:24] Fying from Yankee Station, the area of the Gulf of Tonkin where the aircraft carriers operated,
[00:00:30] we learned what it was like to sit in a wardrobe and a wardrobe table surrounded by empty chairs.
[00:00:38] Half the time, we never knew what happened to them.
[00:00:43] Maybe another pilot noticed an enemy surface to air missile launch or caught a fleeting glimpse of a burning American plane
[00:00:50] heading toward the jungle below. Sometimes we'd hear the air crew requesting help on the ground,
[00:00:56] dodging enemy patrols and calling for rescue. When the helicopters went in,
[00:01:02] the North Vietnamese were often waiting. They shot up the helicopters and their escorting planes.
[00:01:12] We sometimes got our man and lost three more in the process.
[00:01:18] We were flying not just for each other. We were flying for each other's families.
[00:01:28] The man on your wing usually had a wife, maybe some children.
[00:01:34] You took care of him to take care of them.
[00:01:38] We all faced moments where we risked our lives for each other to ensure the contact teams
[00:01:44] did not knock on our brothers' door back in San Diego, Lamor, or would be island.
[00:01:52] When the enemy scored, the families were devastated.
[00:01:58] You seldom see that written about, but we've all come home to tell widows and fatherless kids
[00:02:04] how sorry we were. We gave them what peace we could.
[00:02:12] We've never seen that last night.
[00:02:16] It warps the rest of their lives as they wrestle with the pain.
[00:02:22] That old adage, time heals all wounds.
[00:02:26] No.
[00:02:28] Fifty years on, I've seen those families still break down in tears as they talk of their fallen aviator.
[00:02:38] You don't get over that kind of pain.
[00:02:42] You just learn to live around it.
[00:02:45] It becomes part of who you are.
[00:02:48] And for us out on Yankee Station, that grief motivated us to sacrifice for each other.
[00:02:54] Not everyone could hack it.
[00:02:58] There were days on Yankee Station where I watched air crews lose their nerve.
[00:03:04] The sudden some mechanical mysterious issue came up and a flight had to be scrubbed.
[00:03:10] Sometimes it happened when the same plane was on the catapult ready to launch.
[00:03:16] They just couldn't bring themselves to face it.
[00:03:20] Again, the most fearsome air defense network in the world,
[00:03:24] erected by the North Vietnamese with Russian help around Hanoi.
[00:03:30] On rare occasions, some men turned in their wings and went home rather than face that crucible again.
[00:03:38] It was easier to fly for an airline.
[00:03:42] In three years, the Navy lost 532 aircraft in combat,
[00:03:50] including other operational losses associated with that war, the Navy had 644 aviators killed,
[00:03:56] missing or taken prisoner of war.
[00:04:00] The total fixed wing aircraft losses of the Navy Marine Corps and Air Force together exceeded 2,400.
[00:04:08] Of course, it was intensely personal.
[00:04:12] Darryl Gary lived with nine guys in two houses on the beach in La Jolla when he went through training.
[00:04:18] After the first trip to Yankee Station, six came home.
[00:04:24] Worse, we were losing the larger war.
[00:04:28] Destroying the targets given to us by the Pentagon seemed to make no difference in the war to the south.
[00:04:36] The losses mounted, and the migs started seeking us out.
[00:04:42] The North Vietnamese possessed a small but well-trained air force,
[00:04:46] proxied by their Chinese and Soviet allies.
[00:04:48] As good as it was, they were not in the same league as the Soviet Air Force,
[00:04:54] so in shanked shock waves through the Navy when North Vietnamese pilots started shooting us down.
[00:05:00] During the Korean War, the North Korean Air Force was virtually wiped out in the opening months.
[00:05:06] A decade later, the Vietnamese migs gave us a real fight.
[00:05:12] They shot down one of ours for every two migs that we claimed.
[00:05:20] We considered that lost rate intolerable, given our long history of deeply one-sided kill ratios.
[00:05:26] In World War II, US Naval Aviators crushed the Japanese in the central Pacific on the way to Tokyo with Hellcap pilots
[00:05:34] who scored three-force of the Navy's air to air victories, posting a kill ratio on the order of 19-1.
[00:05:44] In Vietnam, we were simply not allowed to win.
[00:05:48] So the Navy bureaucracy did what bureaucracies do best.
[00:05:54] It continued on course.
[00:05:56] Micro-managed from Washington, DC, we made the same mistakes month after month.
[00:06:06] In January 1969, a plane-scope-spoken carrier-skipper named Frank Alt wrote a report to the chief of naval operations,
[00:06:16] detailing deadly flaws in our fighter tactics and weapon systems.
[00:06:22] His list of complaints was a long one, and the Navy decided to act.
[00:06:28] Unfortunately, many in senior commands were more about their careers than about fixing the problem.
[00:06:36] By approving the creation of an air combat post-graduate school, which we quickly named Top Gun,
[00:06:42] they gave the appearance of doing something to change things.
[00:06:48] President Johnson and Secretary McRenair's leadership, the Navy bureaucracy,
[00:06:54] seemed more interested in appearing to solve problems than risking failure by actually trying to solve them.
[00:07:02] They gave the leadership of Top Gun to a relatively junior officer, me.
[00:07:14] And that right there is an excerpt from the opening of a book called Top Gun, an American story,
[00:07:22] by a man named Dan Peterson, a retired Navy captain, fighter pilot,
[00:07:30] Vietnam Air Combat Veteran, and the first officer in charge of the story,
[00:07:36] the story, the story, the Top Gun, the Navy fighter weapon school.
[00:07:44] And it is an honor to have Dan with us here tonight to talk about his experiences
[00:07:52] and share some of his lessons learned.
[00:07:56] Sir, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:08:00] And because it is Top Gun, I am woefully unqualified to speak with any experience on air combat,
[00:08:08] also joining us is my friend from Ramadi and my colleague from National On Front Dave Burke,
[00:08:14] who has been on this podcast more times than anyone.
[00:08:18] Who served as a fighter pilot in the United States Marine Corps Top Gun instructor,
[00:08:22] Top Gun Senior instructor, Ford Air Controller with us in Ramadi on the ground.
[00:08:26] And pilot of the F-18, the F-16, the F-22, and the F-35.
[00:08:32] So I figured I'd bring someone you could actually talk to, sir.
[00:08:36] That's great.
[00:08:38] So you know, you go through some of this stuff in the book,
[00:08:42] but I want to just kind of lay the groundwork of where you grew up.
[00:08:48] I know you were born in Illinois.
[00:08:50] What was your childhood like?
[00:08:52] And I want to take us through childhood up through where you were in the Navy
[00:08:56] and then we'll get back into the book.
[00:08:58] This is, uh, earliest, met real memories.
[00:09:02] The end of the Second World War.
[00:09:04] My dad had been in Europe, sliding for four years,
[00:09:08] and came home and his job was already filled.
[00:09:12] Move down to California.
[00:09:14] Came to Riverside, California.
[00:09:18] And he worked as a puttin' pipeline in Palm Springs during that period of time.
[00:09:26] I was going to school and working a couple of jobs and making,
[00:09:30] making ends meet, guys.
[00:09:32] And that's where I grew up.
[00:09:34] Then I went to Wittier.
[00:09:36] And the draft came breathing on everybody,
[00:09:40] the follow on draft for Korea.
[00:09:42] And I joined the Navy Reserve and listed guy.
[00:09:50] How old were you when you joined the Navy Reserve?
[00:09:52] I don't know, probably 17.
[00:09:56] Just right there.
[00:09:58] And did you associate the Navy with aviation?
[00:10:02] Yeah.
[00:10:03] So you kind of knew, you know,
[00:10:06] Juckoh, how I got started really.
[00:10:09] I was in a little sit guy and I messed up.
[00:10:13] There are NES lots of automatos.
[00:10:15] It was pretty busy basing those days.
[00:10:17] A lot of World War II props, corsairs.
[00:10:21] And I was a Mac.
[00:10:23] That's when I trained to be.
[00:10:25] It was a Mac.
[00:10:26] And I was mentored by a chief named Brown.
[00:10:28] During that time, I learned to mess up.
[00:10:31] It saved my life for all of me out of the Galle.
[00:10:33] And I got out on the flight line,
[00:10:35] started carrying the man's toolbox and getting his coffee
[00:10:40] when he wanted.
[00:10:42] And he taught me a great deal about it.
[00:10:45] And what really turned me on got me going.
[00:10:51] This is too thin.
[00:10:53] It's quickly.
[00:10:55] There was the lieutenant doing a test flying in that squatter.
[00:10:59] And we were the first quarter and get jets.
[00:11:03] And we had some two seaters.
[00:11:05] TV, two's.
[00:11:07] M.T. backseat.
[00:11:08] Every time I'd work on an engineer playing go through flight test.
[00:11:12] And a person at Lutin says, you know, empty back seat is a waste.
[00:11:19] Come on, go with me.
[00:11:21] And I flew with him in the backseat.
[00:11:23] Maybe five, six, seven, eight times.
[00:11:26] And I was hooked.
[00:11:28] You know that feeling.
[00:11:29] David.
[00:11:30] Yes.
[00:11:31] You know. And so I started flying with him.
[00:11:35] And he quickly said, you're natural.
[00:11:40] You know, you're pretty good at what he said.
[00:11:44] And I'll arrange for the exams.
[00:11:47] And we'll do a physical on it.
[00:11:50] We'll go to Pensacola.
[00:11:52] I said, right on.
[00:11:55] And I was working two jobs and sleeping in my car.
[00:11:59] Going to college at time.
[00:12:01] So it was a perfect time for it.
[00:12:04] And coming to one of the last weekends I spent with those guys.
[00:12:09] In comes Z. Cormere and the blue angels.
[00:12:14] And he had a small smile on me.
[00:12:16] So I watched the blue angels fly.
[00:12:19] And there was a cutless David.
[00:12:22] Put on a, I can't read Billy Phillips.
[00:12:25] Whoops have me? obscene what Stanley Phillips is doing?
[00:12:30] �� What's this and Matthew Phillips set me up to make you
[00:12:35] going to adjective for something good tonight?
[00:12:40] That'sfor me, keep you up.
[00:12:41] Yes, we haveledge of truth.
[00:12:43] We haveledge of truth.
[00:12:45] His story that Beth choke said about Charlie and I
[00:12:47] did not obviously listen to him so that they're killer,
[00:12:51] remember so that he wouldn't take me Rat Moyni,
[00:12:51] knows to know who Grabbed the Rice?
[00:12:54] Cadet program, you know, and I got to tell you more about when we talk about the squadron.
[00:13:00] It was the first fighter squadron.
[00:13:02] Got it.
[00:13:03] With the five aces.
[00:13:06] The old guys from the second world war are getting out.
[00:13:09] Young guys like me were the future ones.
[00:13:12] Yeah, the other thing I always like to think about when we talk about, you know, the past
[00:13:18] wars.
[00:13:20] You getting into a jet.
[00:13:23] What kind of jet was it that the with young was going to be to.
[00:13:26] So you get into a TV too.
[00:13:28] This is like science fiction.
[00:13:30] I mean, the state of technology and you're whatever, 18 or 19 years old and you're going
[00:13:36] into the most modern high speed aircraft ever created.
[00:13:41] That's right.
[00:13:42] That's right.
[00:13:43] And there was a there weren't any passenger jets in those days.
[00:13:47] Probably a DCA tour being invented here in San Diego.
[00:13:53] And it was the first Jedi had ever been in.
[00:13:56] That was an e-ticket ride.
[00:13:58] First time.
[00:13:59] So I'm going to go back to the book here.
[00:14:02] You get down to Pensacola.
[00:14:04] And you say this.
[00:14:05] I Pensacola, we flew the S N J. Texan and the T 28.
[00:14:10] On my first morning there, our drill sergeant woke us up in the barracks with the
[00:14:14] rattle of his nightstick along the seal frames of our bonks, then double time to sound
[00:14:18] to an aging hanger beside the sea plane ramp.
[00:14:21] In the very same building where some of Naval aviation pioneers established our tradition
[00:14:25] to drill sergeant smoked us with 40 minutes of PT.
[00:14:29] Each morning started with the same ritual.
[00:14:31] We worked out in the hanger amongst the ghosts of those who had paved the way for us.
[00:14:36] Thanks to them, Naval aviation became the rebel branch of the service.
[00:14:40] We were always striving to develop new ideas, new technology, and new ways of fighting that
[00:14:45] would send the age of the battleship into history.
[00:14:48] From the battles of the coral sea and midway to the great Marianne's Turkey shoot, they
[00:14:53] transformed the US Navy into the most effective Naval fighting force on the planet.
[00:14:58] Everywhere we went in Pensacola, we felt that tradition and it was an honor to be
[00:15:02] invited to be a part of it.
[00:15:04] Would my generation contribute to perpetuate in the years ahead?
[00:15:08] One thing for sure, I was not going to be the one who washed out and went home to be just
[00:15:12] another college kid with ductal hair, working odd jobs to cover tuition.
[00:15:18] Where other cadets bought cars and spent time in town drinking a trader John's another
[00:15:22] local aviator watering holes I made a point of staying on base.
[00:15:26] My dad's ethic became mine and you talked a lot about your dad's work ethic in here.
[00:15:31] I studied in work hard.
[00:15:33] I was determined to be among the top cadets upon graduation who would be handed the
[00:15:37] keys to the latest and greatest fighter jets are country produced.
[00:15:42] After basic school of Pensacola, we required to take a cross country instrument flight
[00:15:46] to California, the final stage before we advanced to school in Beville, Texas.
[00:15:51] The fringe benefit of this last evolution was a chance to visit home.
[00:15:55] Now here's the caveat that I always need to make when I read these things.
[00:15:58] I'm just skipping giant parts of this book.
[00:16:01] The amount of detail, the stories that you're telling the characters that you're bringing
[00:16:05] out in this book throughout the book are just awesome.
[00:16:10] It's a historical gem just to be able to read it.
[00:16:15] But I'm not going to read the whole thing on the podcast and people need to buy the book
[00:16:20] if they want to get all that out of it.
[00:16:23] There's an audio book as well.
[00:16:25] Either way, you need to read the whole book in order to get this.
[00:16:30] But this, you felt that and I went to our officer candidate school down in Pensacola
[00:16:35] and they have the amazing naval aviation museum there, which is one of the best, I think
[00:16:43] it may be the best museum I've ever been to.
[00:16:45] I've heard the World War II museum in New Orleans is equally awesome, but I haven't been
[00:16:49] there yet.
[00:16:51] But you just felt that heritage as a guy going through OCS.
[00:16:57] You know, just to be selected for something like that, I've been done reasonably well
[00:17:06] in school academically and to be allowed to go down there.
[00:17:14] And you know, you guys are all pros at working out every day.
[00:17:20] They marine die, tallest and new discipline, every day in their whole hangar.
[00:17:27] He worked us and then we'd run.
[00:17:30] And then we'd go to the, what you call it, the course, you know, the obstacle course.
[00:17:38] obstacle course and all the things I've seen it in the SEAL video as a movies and it was
[00:17:45] a ton of life.
[00:17:48] But when you make a commitment to go and it didn't take long and Pensacola to find out
[00:17:54] how you got to go to the first team in the first team be a great fleet squad and a
[00:18:00] care.
[00:18:01] You got to have the great.
[00:18:04] So the motivation was there and it was fun.
[00:18:09] Now did everybody in your flight school want to be, want to get jets?
[00:18:14] Was it just 100% competition?
[00:18:16] Yeah.
[00:18:17] I had a roommate named Malklaid's, Marine, Marine pilot.
[00:18:22] I pinned his wings on, he pinned my wings on the daily finish and he was a great football player
[00:18:29] Orange County high school.
[00:18:32] And we went in together.
[00:18:33] We were roommates all the way through and he decides to go Marine Corps for the last
[00:18:40] minute.
[00:18:41] But we both found we're going to go and score well and we knew we'd get fleet squad.
[00:18:53] You know, a real piece of the history out of that into my logbooks.
[00:18:58] They hadn't seen anybody to a fleet squad or not of Beville in about a year.
[00:19:04] I got the first set of orders.
[00:19:07] It was worth it.
[00:19:13] I was just talking about from the book when you had to do a cross country instrument
[00:19:18] flight to California.
[00:19:19] This gave you a chance to go home and you mentioned this in the book.
[00:19:25] Mary Beth stood on the tarmac looking up at me with my parents at her side.
[00:19:31] She was a vision in an Angora sweater and below the knee skirt.
[00:19:37] And flat healed shoes and with her hair down she had a smile on her face.
[00:19:41] Maybe just a hint of awe as well.
[00:19:44] I could hope.
[00:19:47] I unstrapped and climbed out dressed in a khaki flight suit, a matching jacket and navy
[00:19:51] issued chuck of boots.
[00:19:53] I barely made it down the ladder when she wrapped her arms around me.
[00:19:57] In an instant, the year of separation seemed like an eye blink.
[00:20:01] I knew beyond a doubt this was the woman I wanted to marry.
[00:20:07] But you fast forward a little bit all too soon.
[00:20:09] The beautiful interlude ended.
[00:20:10] My instructor met me at Al Toro a few days after Christmas.
[00:20:13] I wore the ring on my right hand as I kissed Mary Beth goodbye on the ramp she had given
[00:20:17] you a ring.
[00:20:19] Soon I would be an officer in a gentleman.
[00:20:22] I'd ask her father for permission to propose.
[00:20:25] We'd start a life together in the navy.
[00:20:27] A final hug, no tears and I scrambled up the ladder and into the con cockpit.
[00:20:33] As Bill Pearson and I taxid out to run away, I saw her waving goodbye to her naval aviation
[00:20:39] cadet.
[00:20:40] When I landed at Beville, my first jet fighter waited me on the flight line.
[00:20:44] She was a grummin, pff, f-9 f- Panther, a well-traveled aircraft whose dark blue aluminum
[00:20:50] skin was dotted with patched over bullet holes.
[00:20:55] Like my instructor, she was a veteran of Korea, her paint dulled by years of service,
[00:21:00] either straight wing and sub-mock-one top speed the Panther had been relegated to state-side
[00:21:06] pastures where she helped train the next generation of naval aviation.
[00:21:13] Was Korea over at this point or was there a chance that you were still?
[00:21:16] No.
[00:21:17] So what year was this?
[00:21:18] Um, 1955 and 50, uh, 56.
[00:21:23] Okay.
[00:21:24] 56 so it would have been a B-ville.
[00:21:26] Fine.
[00:21:27] So Korea's well over at this point.
[00:21:29] But you still got these pilots, your instructors are straight up combat vets.
[00:21:34] Well, from Korea.
[00:21:36] And they were good.
[00:21:38] Very, very good.
[00:21:40] They were the best.
[00:21:43] This section that you talk about flight school and again, there's so much in this book
[00:21:48] to cover, you know, it was a challenge for me to figure out where I wanted to spend
[00:21:54] time.
[00:21:55] You talk about flight school.
[00:21:57] You have a great section in there about when you make mistakes and you have failures
[00:22:02] and what your attitude was and your attitude was, okay, I messed this up.
[00:22:08] What do I need to do to fix it?
[00:22:10] And you know, you had that attitude of taking ownership of things and then doing the
[00:22:15] hard work to get it done.
[00:22:17] I've heard your books and looked at some of your programs and when you play in the league
[00:22:26] as a possible naval avid or and you make a commitment to finish as a same as a program
[00:22:34] you guys went through.
[00:22:37] And I'm talking about the training, okay.
[00:22:41] And you're dealing human life each other's everyday fine.
[00:22:47] Failures unacceptable.
[00:22:48] You do.
[00:22:49] You make a mistake.
[00:22:51] And this mistake that's in the book, it may have to do with a very old,
[00:22:56] navigation system but we were required to be proficient at it.
[00:23:02] And I got confused in the weather one day and made a mistake went back and flew that
[00:23:10] check right again and out of 18 months of training.
[00:23:15] That's the only time that happened to me.
[00:23:18] But it was unacceptable to fail.
[00:23:22] Guys, that's what I'm telling you and I wanted, I wanted to be a naval avid so bad.
[00:23:32] So well, on March 1st, 1957, I got my wings.
[00:23:42] When my orders arrived, I tore open the envelope running through my worst case scenarios.
[00:23:47] The first of which was blimp's, yes, the 1950s Navy still flew airships.
[00:23:55] We called them poopy bags.
[00:23:57] Nobody wanted to go from flying panthers and t-birds to puttering around at 70 knots with a
[00:24:02] gigantic bag of gas over your head.
[00:24:05] No thank you.
[00:24:06] Then there was an ASW anti submarine warfare.
[00:24:09] This meant multi-engine flying and and in terminally long patrols over open ocean where
[00:24:15] everybody aboard tried not to fall asleep.
[00:24:18] I took a breath, looked down on my orders and read the official Verbiage Directing Me
[00:24:23] to report in 30 days to San Diego.
[00:24:27] I read it twice.
[00:24:29] Then a third time just to be sure I wasn't dreaming.
[00:24:31] I was going to a squadron known as VFAW III.
[00:24:37] V stood for heavier than air.
[00:24:40] No blimps for me.
[00:24:41] F stood for fighters.
[00:24:44] AW stood for all weather.
[00:24:47] I done it.
[00:24:49] I was going to be a jet fighter pilot.
[00:24:52] I was on the road to top gun.
[00:24:56] How many guys from your group ended up making it to jets to fighter jets?
[00:25:02] Two.
[00:25:03] I'll close when I.
[00:25:04] My rooming.
[00:25:05] Wow.
[00:25:06] He went to Makah.
[00:25:10] Oh, down in a flu FJ Fiery's at down on Miami Beach.
[00:25:16] Opa Laka was the name of that base, down in the Marine Bay.
[00:25:20] I went home to Merrimar in San Diego.
[00:25:25] The same state as my Murray-Beth, which was when I got to be honest among them was
[00:25:31] with part of my motivation.
[00:25:32] I wanted to be back.
[00:25:34] I miss her a lot.
[00:25:36] And suddenly in the middle of the book, there's 16 photos.
[00:25:40] Some of the airplanes that you described, Joko, and a couple great pictures of Beth and
[00:25:46] I.
[00:25:47] Yeah, particularly her.
[00:25:48] And what's nice is they put together the use-collar, full-collar photographs.
[00:25:53] Yeah.
[00:25:54] I can tell you, you had a lot more cloud rolling into your book publishing.
[00:25:57] You can look at the first edition of my first book has a bunch of crappy black and white
[00:26:02] photos on bad paper.
[00:26:04] Look at the full glossy scenario going on.
[00:26:07] Thanks to the first top-good movie.
[00:26:12] So we're going back to the book here.
[00:26:14] My first act as an ins and the US Navy was to buy a car.
[00:26:18] My gang of new officers at lunch for the first time at the officers club in Corpus Christi
[00:26:22] Texas decided, at least one of us needed to have a set of wheels.
[00:26:25] We rolled the dice to see you would go down to the dealership and I lost.
[00:26:28] I picked out a brand new 1957 Ford Fairlane, Raven Black with black and colonial white
[00:26:35] matching interior, sidewall straight out of American graffiti.
[00:26:39] I drove home from Texas to in my new ride, eager to see Mary Beth, make a men's and
[00:26:45] take her for a spin.
[00:26:46] I had 30 days of leave before I needed to report and I intended to use every minute
[00:26:50] of it counting my girl.
[00:26:53] But morning after I got home, I went to meet with Mary Beth.
[00:26:57] You didn't write, she said.
[00:26:59] I didn't get any letters for a while.
[00:27:02] I was about to explain when she said, Dan, I'm seeing someone.
[00:27:05] When you didn't write, well, he was persistent and I gave in.
[00:27:10] I didn't know what to say.
[00:27:11] He was a football player at college.
[00:27:13] They've been seeing each other for a few weeks.
[00:27:16] And you know, I talked about, well, you talk about it in the book when the training was
[00:27:21] really hard.
[00:27:22] Obviously, you had to prioritize what you were going to focus on.
[00:27:26] Even though you wrote Mary Beth every night, when the training got to a point where you
[00:27:30] had to focus more on the training, you didn't write for some time or sometimes you didn't
[00:27:34] write.
[00:27:35] And that was the little break in the opportunity for this football player.
[00:27:39] It was when I had the one navigation flight failure and it rocked my foundation.
[00:27:52] And I missed a couple weeks of writing to her otherwise for 18 months when written back
[00:27:57] and forth every day, except for that period of time.
[00:28:02] And a beautiful young girl going to college and she was pretty popular girl.
[00:28:08] Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:09] Damn football player.
[00:28:13] You're up against some tough competition.
[00:28:17] But you have to drive on.
[00:28:19] You go to North Island at North Island, the guard at the front gate gave me directions
[00:28:22] to VFAW III.
[00:28:25] The squadron's executive commander was a guy named Commander Eugene Valencia.
[00:28:32] Round face and solidly built with thinning hair, my new exo happened to be the third highest
[00:28:37] US Navy Ace of World War II, one of the great legends of our community.
[00:28:43] In one engagement over the Japanese home islands in 1945, he shot down six enemy planes.
[00:28:52] He finished the war with 23 flags on the side of his F6F Hellcat.
[00:29:00] The man introducing himself to me held the Navy Cross and six distinguished flying crosses.
[00:29:06] I was in awe.
[00:29:08] Yet Commander Valencia was anything but arrogant.
[00:29:12] He greeted me and set me at ease with his relaxed, honest, zooming nature.
[00:29:16] It was hard to believe that a man with so many accomplishments could be so grounded and
[00:29:20] approachable.
[00:29:22] It was exactly that.
[00:29:27] And did you know this going into the room?
[00:29:29] Oh no.
[00:29:30] I had.
[00:29:31] I had no background on the fighter squadron.
[00:29:34] He was one, the skipper, the squadron was Howard A. D. who flew and found the Japanese fleet
[00:29:44] to battle the midway.
[00:29:46] He was a commanding officer.
[00:29:48] And there were four other racers.
[00:29:50] The famous Texo Niel was in that fighter squadron.
[00:29:54] He talked about walking in the ready room and you knew you're pecking order.
[00:30:00] And these guys were bigger in life.
[00:30:03] What does it take to become an ace?
[00:30:05] You got to get five.
[00:30:06] You got to get five.
[00:30:07] I've made the number.
[00:30:09] And he became an ace and he shot down six planes.
[00:30:12] And one day.
[00:30:16] How long did it take you to start putting this together?
[00:30:18] I mean, these guys were in their dress uniforms.
[00:30:20] Are you looking at this guy's rack of ribbons?
[00:30:22] Seeing that he's a Navy Cross or something?
[00:30:24] You know, most of it.
[00:30:26] Most of it's done at the bar.
[00:30:29] And there's a bar in North Island called the Ibar, which the Saces, they control the place.
[00:30:39] And they had their own bartender.
[00:30:42] And once and a while you get invited to go with them.
[00:30:46] And a good, good, volentious story.
[00:30:49] I hit it off with the old man.
[00:30:51] I flew with him as I said, wasn't the best.
[00:30:55] But I got enough.
[00:30:56] I got enough for a really to pick up on his ammo.
[00:31:02] How he operated during combat.
[00:31:05] A lot of about tactics.
[00:31:07] He and Texan, the only guys.
[00:31:11] They were mentoring us.
[00:31:14] There were five incidents eventually in that year in that squatter.
[00:31:20] And we had all the 50, 60 airplanes I think.
[00:31:25] Four different kinds.
[00:31:26] All the flight time.
[00:31:28] David, do you ever, ever find yourself?
[00:31:30] We had all the flight time.
[00:31:32] He could physically and.
[00:31:35] I don't ever remember flying too much.
[00:31:38] Yeah.
[00:31:39] Well, just.
[00:31:41] And we, they all mentored us.
[00:31:45] I started.
[00:31:46] I went to first day of hook.
[00:31:48] First day of hook.
[00:31:50] Convention.
[00:31:52] And what I did with I carried this brief case full of scotch.
[00:31:57] And that's the instance mission.
[00:31:59] Yeah.
[00:32:00] The instance.
[00:32:01] And since all went down there with the lynch, Alex, for I shoot another living
[00:32:05] ace 25 victories.
[00:32:08] These guys are bigger in life, you know.
[00:32:10] And your teams have the same reputations.
[00:32:16] Yeah, when I checked into seal team one, the executive officer was a prime listed guy
[00:32:20] that was a Vietnam legend.
[00:32:24] There's a famous picture of the seals and Vietnam of this.
[00:32:27] The picture always says that dirty doesn't on it, even though there's more than 12 of them.
[00:32:30] But it says that dirty does and they're holding up a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
[00:32:37] he's one of the guys in that picture.
[00:32:38] You know, he's the guy that he's one of the guys that the seal teams reputation is built
[00:32:43] upon.
[00:32:44] And I, I remember looking, you know, look, I, at that time, I didn't know the difference
[00:32:49] between a marksmanship ribbon and a metal of honor when you're looking at the uniform.
[00:32:55] And I'm, I just looked in, said that's a lot.
[00:32:57] These guys got a lot of decorations on his uniform.
[00:33:00] And we, you know, the ones that I did know the purple heart, this overstar, I'm looking
[00:33:04] at it going, okay, this, this, this is, this is a, this is everything you dream of, right?
[00:33:10] It's to be sitting across my table.
[00:33:12] I'm 19 years old.
[00:33:14] And this guy's telling me, welcome aboard seal team one.
[00:33:16] Oh, that's right.
[00:33:19] It doesn't get me better than that.
[00:33:20] And the little thing example of where they've been and what they've done.
[00:33:26] And they're willingness, like, philenchin at holes, five or six of the guys who had really
[00:33:32] done it all.
[00:33:34] They, they made no bones upon it.
[00:33:36] They were there to mentor us.
[00:33:38] They went home and night with their families and their grown kids and their glasses
[00:33:44] got and they let the fund us.
[00:33:48] I flew two to three times a day, just as much as I could stand.
[00:33:54] And that's what, when I showed you a log book today, yeah, that's pretty good for
[00:33:59] the final pilot at my age.
[00:34:03] And I ended up at first quarter, fifteen hundred hours a head of my contemporaries.
[00:34:10] Dave, how many hours did you fly at your first quadrant?
[00:34:13] I left my first quadrant after four years with twelve hundred hours.
[00:34:18] So the numbers you're talking about when I said I don't ever remember flying too much
[00:34:21] is because I didn't get to fly like that.
[00:34:23] That's impressive.
[00:34:24] So you did fourteen hundred hours after four years.
[00:34:27] Dan, you're saying you had fifteen hundred hours more than your contemporaries.
[00:34:33] Yeah.
[00:34:34] Yeah.
[00:34:35] Well, you know, I thoroughly liked it.
[00:34:38] Well, I was there. I got to fly the F6FL cat.
[00:34:43] Gino, they had a bunch of my repair facility in North Island.
[00:34:48] And Gino kept talking about the guns and how he worked everything in that airplane.
[00:34:55] That's where he got his victories.
[00:34:57] So he says, you want to fly it?
[00:35:00] So I picked a phone up and he called the chief over the Naval repair facility.
[00:35:05] And he says, I got six of my, I can't get anybody to fly him.
[00:35:09] So I'm going to over and I flew the F6FL cat.
[00:35:12] When you're transferring from one helicopter up from one aircraft to another aircraft,
[00:35:19] how hard is it to make those adaptations?
[00:35:23] It's easy.
[00:35:25] If you love it, Jacoits, easy.
[00:35:29] Later on, the book, I'm sure.
[00:35:31] We were up at Dreamland.
[00:35:32] Yeah.
[00:35:33] Area 51.
[00:35:34] And in 30 minutes, I came in and a transport didn't even know where I was.
[00:35:44] They took us in a hanger, an open hanger doors, because they didn't want the satellites
[00:35:49] to see what they had.
[00:35:51] And Guy walks in with me and says, come on, climb up.
[00:35:56] So I climbed a cockpit of a make.
[00:35:59] 30 minutes of the air, I was in the air and that same airplane.
[00:36:03] You know, it's like driving your Porsche.
[00:36:06] Right.
[00:36:07] Once you can handle a Porsche.
[00:36:09] Or my Dodge Caravan in my case, but it's all good.
[00:36:14] Anyhow, long wind day, answer, but no.
[00:36:16] It's easy.
[00:36:17] Once you're either a part of it and you can do it, new airplanes are exciting.
[00:36:26] You go on a little bit more about your checking in and you say this, the officer of the
[00:36:30] day said, why don't you go get your flight gear and put it in
[00:36:33] your new locker.
[00:36:34] He pointed out a bank of them in the main hanger.
[00:36:37] When I found my assigned locker, I opened it up to find it was full of somebody else's
[00:36:40] stuff.
[00:36:41] I think there's been a mistake I said.
[00:36:43] The officer of the day looked stricken.
[00:36:45] Sorry about that.
[00:36:46] We forgot to clear it out.
[00:36:48] Clear it out.
[00:36:49] That locker belonged to Lieutenant J.G. replacing.
[00:36:52] He was killed a little while back, accident.
[00:36:55] Go ahead and throw everything away.
[00:36:57] The rest of his effects already went to his family.
[00:36:59] I walked back to the locker and stared at the items inside with a new perspective.
[00:37:04] A radiolt-teacher to hung on one hook, a few other nickmacks and toiletries sat on the shelf.
[00:37:09] Then I noticed something unusual.
[00:37:11] A pair of eyes were staring back at me.
[00:37:13] I reached in and pulled off the top shelf at tiny stuffed mouse.
[00:37:18] It was about two inches tall with big eyes, soft gray fur and a tail.
[00:37:23] The toy seemed out of place in a fighter pilot's locker.
[00:37:27] Was it a gift to his child never delivered because of that last fatal flight?
[00:37:31] Was it a gift from his child to him?
[00:37:34] If it was a lucky talisman that served as a reminder of who waited for him back home,
[00:37:40] I hated to think it had failed him.
[00:37:43] Suddenly I didn't want to know.
[00:37:45] Talk about an attitude adjustment.
[00:37:47] My problem seemed trivial, selfish compared to the death of the mouse's owner.
[00:37:53] I trashed the shirt and toy the trees.
[00:37:55] As the mouse hovered over the can, I held it there and regarded it again.
[00:38:00] Who might have throw away another man's mouse?
[00:38:03] I took the little guy back to my flight bag and made him a nest deep inside.
[00:38:08] That mouse is part of the whole story.
[00:38:13] He lives right now on about the fourth bookshelf in our library at home.
[00:38:21] He's there.
[00:38:26] You continue on and this is what you were starting to talk about a little earlier.
[00:38:30] But in my squadron, the senior leadership came of age in World War 2 in Korean and the Korean
[00:38:34] War.
[00:38:35] They told us how during the Pacific War, they learned to avoid getting into a turning
[00:38:39] dogfight with more maneuverable Japanese fighters.
[00:38:43] Trying to turn with more agile Japanese planes would get your tail shot off.
[00:38:48] They took their shot and flew away.
[00:38:50] One pass, Hall-Ass was the Axium.
[00:38:53] They learned to work together in pairs, cooperating to make sure that an enemy couldn't
[00:38:57] latch onto a pilot's tail.
[00:38:58] The other American pilot was always ready to turn towards his partner and stick his guns
[00:39:03] in the enemy's face.
[00:39:05] My flight leader Bill Armstrong explained to me that in Korea, the opposite was the case.
[00:39:10] The tactics of World War 2 would get a pilot killed going up against a communist Meg 15.
[00:39:16] Those jets were faster and through higher than anything the Navy had, including the hot F-9F
[00:39:23] Panther-I had flown in training.
[00:39:26] Given the Meg speed and advantage, given the Meg speed advantage, the horizontal plane became
[00:39:31] the Panthers playground.
[00:39:33] It could outturn the Meg 15, so in just six years we changed tactics altogether.
[00:39:39] One pass Hall-Ass went away and US fighter pilots found their advantage in sharp turning
[00:39:45] dog fights.
[00:39:47] In the missile age, it was all changing again.
[00:39:50] At least that's what the Navy believed.
[00:39:52] We would simply be directed by ground control to a point in the sky, lock our little circle
[00:39:57] on the dot and let loose with a missile.
[00:39:59] No more, see to the pan's flying and maneuvering in sharply turning fights.
[00:40:05] Technology promised a revolution.
[00:40:09] During my time at FVA W3, the old ways were outlawed.
[00:40:14] Dog fighting officially known as Air Combat maneuvering or ACM was forbidden.
[00:40:20] In 1960, the year before I left for my next assignment, the Navy shuttered the last of the
[00:40:24] old schools that trained fighter pilots to dog fight, the Fleet Air Gunner Unit at
[00:40:30] El Central.
[00:40:31] From then on, Air Combat maneuvering was banned.
[00:40:35] If you were caught hassling, as we called dog fighting, your career could end.
[00:40:40] The edict against dog fighting divided our squadron into three factions.
[00:40:44] Our senior leadership whose experience ran countered at everything the Navy was doing now
[00:40:48] had fought two wars and had seen friends die.
[00:40:53] Having spent years away from their families on fleet deployments, they focused on being
[00:40:56] dads and husbands.
[00:40:58] At the end of their careers, they were content to mentor us nuggets on the ground, share
[00:41:02] experiences and teach us how to be leaders.
[00:41:05] They left the bulk of the flying to the younger guys.
[00:41:08] In the second camp, we're junior officers who bought into the new way.
[00:41:13] They never hassled, never pushed their sky rays to the edge of the flight envelope.
[00:41:19] The third group, a quiet group of young tigers, fought otherwise.
[00:41:24] I was one of them, and we decided to do something about it.
[00:41:29] A little division, little groups, little clicks of people.
[00:41:34] The older tired guys look, they're doing their jobs, but they're not too concerned.
[00:41:41] The guys that are listening to the way the Navy is saying it's going to be done and they're
[00:41:44] okay with that.
[00:41:46] And then you guys that wanted to scrap.
[00:41:49] It's a matter of your personal courage.
[00:41:54] That's in one of your books.
[00:41:59] The pen on how good you want to be in the airplane.
[00:42:01] A lot of guys were getting ready to go with the airlines, just booking flight time to go
[00:42:07] with the airlines.
[00:42:09] At this time, airline pilots made a ton of money, right?
[00:42:13] Then on fur bun, 10, 20 years.
[00:42:17] But I never, I never even considered that.
[00:42:20] And I couldn't give up going to 50,000 feet in six degree climb angle, right day.
[00:42:31] Dave, you didn't get tempted by Delta or American?
[00:42:34] I'm squarely in his cabin.
[00:42:36] So this is what happens.
[00:42:38] This next chapter is called Fight Club.
[00:42:42] You say here off the California coast about 80 miles west of San Diego, there's a sector
[00:42:46] of restricted airspace that encompasses saying Clemente Island.
[00:42:50] It's a military reservation.
[00:42:52] Air controllers call it Whiskey 291, the US Navy squadrons in Southern California, use it
[00:42:57] for training exercises.
[00:43:00] That was our playground.
[00:43:02] I first heard about West's, the West Coast elicit dog fighting scene one night after
[00:43:07] hours in San Diego bar.
[00:43:09] It might have been the hotel del Coronado or a Mexican restaurant where we knocked back
[00:43:12] to Kila.
[00:43:14] It was certainly not at the North Island officers club or in the ready room.
[00:43:18] There were too many ears that could make things difficult.
[00:43:21] We were free to fly almost anywhere we wanted.
[00:43:23] Our squadron had plenty of aircraft and our chain of command encouraged us to get stick time.
[00:43:28] Almost always we could find a valid reason to fly.
[00:43:32] Here's the thing, you learn by doing.
[00:43:35] Those of us who live to fly learned our craft by flying a lot.
[00:43:40] One Friday afternoon after a long week on standing alert, I went to the maintenance shop
[00:43:44] and signed out a Ford.
[00:43:46] I had heard that at the bar on Friday afternoons before cocktail hour was the best time
[00:43:51] to find our version of a street race.
[00:43:54] I took off from North Island and headed west for Whiskey 291.
[00:43:58] The unwritten rules in my mind, one of them established a hard deck at 5000 feet.
[00:44:02] This meant that the fight was over the moment you dip below that altitude.
[00:44:06] It was a nod to safety.
[00:44:07] If you ran into trouble and entered a spin, you needed that altitude to recover.
[00:44:12] By joining this fight club, we were keeping the flame alive for a certain way of being
[00:44:18] a fighter pilot.
[00:44:19] It was also serious.
[00:44:21] We were preserving our birthright as naval aviators.
[00:44:24] But first time I went out there south of Sanctuary, I was amazed at what I found.
[00:44:28] Marine A4 Skyhawks Air National Guard F86L interceptors Air Force F100 Super Sabers
[00:44:35] and lots of Navy guys flying F8 crew savers.
[00:44:38] There were even a few other forwards from North Island.
[00:44:41] The word had spread far beyond the Navy community and the services mixed it up with fierce
[00:44:46] relish because they all were going through the same institutional evolution away from
[00:44:51] air combat that we and naval aviation were experiencing.
[00:44:57] You this is classic.
[00:44:59] I learned the ropes that first time out.
[00:45:01] Pick your opponent, roll up alongside and give the signal.
[00:45:06] The signal being the bird.
[00:45:08] So you flip the guy off.
[00:45:09] That's how you kick this thing off.
[00:45:11] Let's say you're initiated.
[00:45:12] A smile in the wave and a 45 degree bank in opposite break in opposite directions.
[00:45:17] A break means we rolled the wings and turned one way.
[00:45:20] The guy to the left broke left 45 degrees left.
[00:45:23] The guy on the right broke 45 degrees right.
[00:45:25] We'd extend our way.
[00:45:26] We'd extend out away from each other for several seconds until we were a few miles distance.
[00:45:31] Then we began the fight.
[00:45:33] We turned into each other pushing fronals forward in what to the uninitiated look like an
[00:45:37] aerial game of chicken in Mach 1 fighters.
[00:45:40] We're pushing head to head or close to it.
[00:45:42] Two fighters inevitably passed each other close aboard.
[00:45:46] We called this the merge.
[00:45:48] Closing somewhere north of a combined thousand miles an hour meant the merge is over in
[00:45:52] mere three seconds.
[00:45:54] Before a collision we'd break away showing our first best move.
[00:45:58] That was when the hassle began.
[00:46:00] There was no script for what happened after the merge.
[00:46:02] We reacted to each other flying our aircraft as best we could.
[00:46:05] We learned that power is king.
[00:46:07] More gives you the ability to climb above a fight to re-enter it with even more energy and
[00:46:11] a diving attack.
[00:46:13] Power means you can push your bird in a tighter and tighter turn and maintain the air
[00:46:18] speed longer.
[00:46:20] When we had enough and were ready to admit defeat, maybe our opponent gained position
[00:46:24] at six o'clock and never let go.
[00:46:26] We waggle our wings, pulled up the long side our opponent and flew wing to wing.
[00:46:31] Sometimes we smiled unseen behind our oxygen masks and waved.
[00:46:34] Nice flight brother.
[00:46:36] Sometimes we just eyeball each other pissed off that somebody had gotten the better of
[00:46:40] us.
[00:46:41] Invariably out there there was someone a little better than I was but each time I went
[00:46:45] out, when or lose I improved.
[00:46:52] How fun was that?
[00:46:54] And I pay you to go to you know.
[00:46:57] And it sounds like at this time you had unlimited fuel unlimited.
[00:47:00] You do this as much as you possibly want.
[00:47:04] And maybe I bought some Douglas Skyrares Batwing airplane took the guns out which was
[00:47:10] a shame but getting ready for missile stuff.
[00:47:19] It wasn't a great carer plane because it allowed rules stability.
[00:47:23] It was pretty dangerous.
[00:47:24] Kill a lot of guys on the aircraft carer.
[00:47:27] They're in the initial phase of trials with the airplane.
[00:47:32] So they sent them all to be at the F.A.N.P. 3 and it would climb like nothing you ever
[00:47:38] seen.
[00:47:39] Just cram it and burn her and hang on.
[00:47:41] A stick with about six inches high just block her arm and break her gone 30 degrees.
[00:47:49] Go to 60 degrees and go to 50,000 feet.
[00:47:54] You know that's a neat ticket ride and anybody's book.
[00:47:58] Dave did you have any experience where you...
[00:48:02] And we're the Marine Corps didn't know what you were doing but you were out with a bunch
[00:48:06] of your friends and the Navy and the Air Force scrapping.
[00:48:10] And I don't know what the statue of limitations is on this and if you can still get trouble
[00:48:15] at this time.
[00:48:16] No I'm safe now.
[00:48:18] It's not like what you ain't just talking about.
[00:48:20] There isn't an illicit thing.
[00:48:22] What there would be is four guys in the squadron going on the road together.
[00:48:29] Everybody knew we were going.
[00:48:30] And we would do things very similar when we talked about is we would...
[00:48:34] We would do things that badly we weren't supposed to be doing.
[00:48:37] And we were doing another guy is now there was a degree of safety in the organizations
[00:48:40] that communities had come a long way because of what they learned.
[00:48:44] But man we would...
[00:48:45] I have done a lot of things in an airplane that if I had a came back and told my boss
[00:48:49] I did it.
[00:48:50] We would have a real problem.
[00:48:52] And more than anything it's the culture that that generation created.
[00:48:55] We were smart about safety we do a lot of things that to keep the airplanes in us safe.
[00:49:00] But man that spirit and that culture I'm just...
[00:49:02] I mean I'm grinning ear to ear listening to this because that's where this all came from
[00:49:06] was pushing against the organization.
[00:49:08] These are things we have to do and look...
[00:49:10] There's a lot of things I wouldn't tell anybody about.
[00:49:13] You know, while I was doing it looking back on and now it's actually kind of fun to think
[00:49:17] about it.
[00:49:18] Man we did some going on the road for ship out of Miramar.
[00:49:21] Man you had a license to steal.
[00:49:23] It was awesome.
[00:49:24] You know you mentioned this earlier which I read.
[00:49:29] We talked about the naval aviation being the rebel branch of the Navy.
[00:49:37] And you know that attitude right there.
[00:49:40] If you don't have that rebel attitude this these thoughts don't even enter your mind
[00:49:45] to push the envelope like this.
[00:49:47] You know you're dealing in human life.
[00:49:50] You all understand that fully I know when you're every day it's not just fun flying.
[00:49:58] It's serious business.
[00:50:01] It's perfect professional excellence.
[00:50:05] And you keep building it.
[00:50:06] You gotta remember we're talking about the fight club being illegal in the 58-59 and
[00:50:14] 60-61.
[00:50:18] And then for the next four years it was still semi-alegal.
[00:50:25] And then along came a four which we'll get to and then sure.
[00:50:30] And it became it was it was the menu of the day.
[00:50:38] Haslan was kind of wish everybody could ask.
[00:50:42] Again your butt kicked out.
[00:50:43] Turned Vietnam.
[00:50:45] And all the stuff we learned back in the 58-59-60 it was easy to sell it.
[00:50:54] Yeah you talk about here you say I learned the basics of air combat in those hassles
[00:51:00] never lose sight of your opponent.
[00:51:02] Lucite lose the fight.
[00:51:03] Never go vertical unless you can own it.
[00:51:05] Meaning you have to have enough pure engine power to blast guy or to leave your opponent
[00:51:09] unable to follow you and hammer you from behind.
[00:51:13] Turning fights are like back alley brawls.
[00:51:15] When similar aircraft engage like that the difference is pilot skill and aggressiveness.
[00:51:19] The winner usually is the one with the most guts to push his aircraft to its aerodynamic
[00:51:25] limit.
[00:51:26] In this way we preserved our perishable skills, our perishable skill sets and kept alive
[00:51:32] the fading art of the dogfight.
[00:51:34] The rest of the navy was letting it slip away in the early 1960s.
[00:51:37] I flew whenever I could.
[00:51:39] Holidays were a great time to hassle because the married guys were at home with their
[00:51:43] families and the pace of the activity on base relaxed.
[00:51:47] I was still trying to get over Mary Beth so I'd climb in a forward and go look for a good
[00:51:51] fight.
[00:51:54] This is also important.
[00:51:55] Fighting against different types of planes was useful.
[00:51:57] It taught me more than fighting against the same type of plane I was piloting.
[00:52:02] In years and later years at top gone we would call it dissimilar air combat training.
[00:52:07] But back in the late 1950s we didn't have a name for it.
[00:52:10] We just we just intuitively based on experience.
[00:52:14] Each fight with a different type of aircraft, each with its own advantages and weaknesses,
[00:52:19] taught us how to exploit our edge and minimize theirs.
[00:52:23] How did we learn?
[00:52:24] By losing.
[00:52:25] Failure is a teacher.
[00:52:27] Be honest with yourself, extract the lessons and you'll never make that error again.
[00:52:31] I spent many long flights back to North Island, repaying what I did wrong so that on my
[00:52:36] next bout in the inner service flight club I'd bring the heat and wind and wind.
[00:52:42] When we found a top gun this part of the experience in whiskey 2-9-1 became a very important
[00:52:48] component of our culture.
[00:52:50] That's what my point was.
[00:52:53] All of a sudden it wasn't illegal.
[00:52:56] It's we need something like this.
[00:52:58] Can you teach us how?
[00:53:01] And it worked.
[00:53:05] You end up going on deployment.
[00:53:10] I'm skipping ahead a little bit.
[00:53:11] The very first cruise game of front row seats to the US Navy Power Projection in action.
[00:53:16] Deployed to West Park, we guarded the sea lanes, trained off the coast of Japan and flew
[00:53:20] the flag at various ports of call.
[00:53:22] Our F3HDmen's intercepted Soviet bombers that periodically dropped down to snoop on us.
[00:53:28] We chased them as soon as our radar was caught them.
[00:53:31] When the TU-95 bears took their photos of us, we wanted a demon in the frame.
[00:53:36] We got our ability to destroy them at will, was a game we played with the Russians for the
[00:53:41] entire Cold War.
[00:53:43] More than once I watched a Russian gunner wave at me as I snapped pictures through the
[00:53:47] canopy.
[00:53:48] Such moments were rare in fleeting just too aircrew at the tip of the spear making
[00:53:52] momentary personal contact at altitude over the world's largest ocean.
[00:53:59] And they usually showed playboy magazine which was newer than we had on the curve.
[00:54:06] It was a game, you know, the news media now makes it sound so serious.
[00:54:13] It was a game.
[00:54:15] They just competitive, what could you do?
[00:54:18] One time I was out, pull up alongside a bear flying a later on flying a fan in my call
[00:54:27] time for my back seat or was a little hot.
[00:54:31] And he, I look in the mirror and we're sitting right next to this bear.
[00:54:37] And in the back seat it's a plastic pink rabbit.
[00:54:44] He's inflated rabbit.
[00:54:46] And the only thing to make or the only thing to bear guys can see in their alls in the
[00:54:52] back turret back there trying to look over and laughing because he's put a pink rabbit
[00:54:58] up.
[00:54:59] He's got a stick.
[00:55:02] A little humor.
[00:55:03] But it was, it was no work.
[00:55:06] Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:55:08] You never done anything like that in Marine Corps, did you?
[00:55:11] I was, I was lucky enough to intercept a bear on my first cruise.
[00:55:14] I have just a legendary shot of me in a hornet up against a bear.
[00:55:18] I got to intercept an Iranian.
[00:55:20] I think it was kind of their version of the C130 right on the line there in the Gulf
[00:55:23] pull up alongside.
[00:55:24] And re-living or living for the first time these stories I had heard about for literally
[00:55:29] decades, looking at the window of my fighter at a Iranian cargo plane flying, he's on his
[00:55:37] side of the line.
[00:55:38] On my side there's probably a hundred feet, 200 feet between us, waving maybe some other
[00:55:44] hand signals along the way.
[00:55:45] But those are things that those are pictures of him in your mind.
[00:55:49] You'll never forget those things.
[00:55:50] The first time I intercepted a bear on an alert seven launch off a carrier just sitting
[00:55:53] in the cockpit, launch off.
[00:55:55] I go 20, you know, 12 minutes later.
[00:55:57] I'm in parade off of a bear just thinking how many times has happened for me for anybody
[00:56:03] else before.
[00:56:04] It was a bear and say, love to come down and go fast and ride along the way.
[00:56:09] That could occur.
[00:56:10] They'll make a low pass on the carrier.
[00:56:14] So you got to be, you got to be in the picture.
[00:56:16] I got to let them know that you have been there the whole time.
[00:56:20] The only because of you are they getting to do that.
[00:56:22] So it's a cool history to say I got to do that.
[00:56:27] Speaking of always, oh, all business, we say here we broke out above the cloud layer at
[00:56:34] 15,000 feet and I'm fast-forwarding.
[00:56:36] No moon, no visible horizon.
[00:56:37] My demon suffered electrical failure and the lights went out in the cockpit.
[00:56:40] A wind powered auxiliary unit was supposed to deploy in such a situation but that failed
[00:56:45] as well.
[00:56:46] There I was surrounded by absolute darkness using a 90 degree angled flashlight to periodically
[00:56:51] check my instruments.
[00:56:52] I was flying that mission with our squadron executive officer Lieutenant Commander Joe
[00:56:56] Paulk who realized my predicament and came to my rescue.
[00:57:00] Joe sent a signal to me with his flashlight, followed me and pointed to the handcocks
[00:57:05] latest position.
[00:57:07] It was an eerie sensation flying on his wing in the dark on route to the handcocks
[00:57:11] waiting deck.
[00:57:12] I forced myself to keep my wings level relative to his wing and belly navigation lights.
[00:57:19] I used small precise control inputs made easier by Joe's smooth flying.
[00:57:25] We broke out of the cloud layer about a mile and a half a stern of the ship.
[00:57:29] We could see the white strobes back in us.
[00:57:32] I continued flying Joe's wing until his lights went out and he turned away to give
[00:57:36] me a clear shot at the deck.
[00:57:38] The electrical failure had knocked out my radio which meant I could not talk to the landing
[00:57:42] signal officer.
[00:57:43] All I could do was watch his lights.
[00:57:45] A green one meant keep coming flashing reds would be the dreaded wave off, go around
[00:57:49] and try again.
[00:57:50] I didn't have enough fuel for that.
[00:57:52] So if I missed, I'd have to eject, trusting that someone would find me in the stormy
[00:57:57] sea.
[00:57:58] I made it down and felt the tail hook catch one of the deck wires.
[00:58:02] The demon lurched to a hole.
[00:58:04] A close call for sure but it was nover.
[00:58:06] The next night while flying the same demon, the same thing happened again.
[00:58:11] I was on Joe's wing and he brought me back to the handcocks for an encore performance.
[00:58:15] I landed safely after another gut check approach.
[00:58:18] Perhaps we joked about him saving me twice.
[00:58:23] The interracing point on an end, Joe.
[00:58:26] You mean beyond the fastest landing at the weekend?
[00:58:28] Yeah, you're reading a lot of the book.
[00:58:32] And the next paragraph says, can't figure out two nights in a row and happened to me.
[00:58:39] And they are playing flu during the daylight hours successfully with no electrical failure
[00:58:46] in between that do event.
[00:58:48] I started to get spooked a little bit.
[00:58:52] What somebody said me a message.
[00:58:54] Yeah, and the reason I brought that or the reason I wanted to read that is, look, it's
[00:59:01] peace time, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:03] When you're flying and landing on an aircraft carrier and the weather and mechanical failures,
[00:59:08] I used to say this about I would tell the young seals when you go out and do water
[00:59:12] operations, everything you do is a real world mission.
[00:59:15] Is that the ocean can kill you if you make a mistake, you die.
[00:59:20] And I used to say that pre-war, you know, in the 90s when I would try to be get guys to
[00:59:24] make sure they're taking stuff seriously and not gaffing off procedures.
[00:59:29] And it's the same thing here.
[00:59:30] I mean, I can't just this idea.
[00:59:34] And I'm pretty sure I know the angled flashlight that you're talking about is probably
[00:59:38] the same, yeah, that piece of crap.
[00:59:40] You're lucky.
[00:59:41] That thing didn't fail.
[00:59:42] Green one.
[00:59:43] Yeah.
[00:59:44] Yeah.
[00:59:45] And then the other thought that thing I thought was awesome about this was Joe knowing.
[00:59:51] All right, I'm going to guide him right in and then I'm going to black myself out.
[00:59:55] I'm going to get out of his way and it's on you.
[00:59:57] You just, you guys can't even talk, but you know what to do.
[00:59:59] He knows what to do.
[01:00:01] The guy that's landing, you know what to do.
[01:00:04] That's awesome.
[01:00:06] That's the naval aviation training.
[01:00:08] There it is.
[01:00:09] Right, Nate.
[01:00:10] Hey, man.
[01:00:12] Go on here, you say Mary Beth had gotten married to her football player.
[01:00:17] I never tried to win her back.
[01:00:18] And that was on the, you talk about this is on the advice of your mom.
[01:00:21] He said, don't, no, you let her go.
[01:00:24] Her marriage was the final nail in the coffin of my wishful thinking.
[01:00:26] I had let her go.
[01:00:28] Eventually I met a wonderful girl.
[01:00:30] A wonderful young woman in Coronado, Maddie, and married her 1959 a year later, our daughter
[01:00:35] Dana arrived.
[01:00:37] My wife and I began a 17 year journey in Navy life with far too much of it spent to park.
[01:00:43] Flying as a dangerous game of risk and reward.
[01:00:46] Push too far and you pay the price.
[01:00:47] Before I joined the black lines, I only had to look out for myself and my squadron mates.
[01:00:53] Different game now.
[01:00:54] I live for two others who depend on me becoming a family man, coincided with my first
[01:00:59] fleet assignment on board the handcock.
[01:01:02] My 1962 deployment lasted from February to November.
[01:01:05] We got back to the West Coast and started training for the next one, running simulated
[01:01:09] intercepts in our demons three or four nights a week on that schedule.
[01:01:13] Even when we were home, we were really not home.
[01:01:16] Our 1963 deployment began in the spring and being home after being home for less than six
[01:01:21] months.
[01:01:22] Hugs, good buys, tears on cheeks, Dana's little hand pressed into mine.
[01:01:27] Then back to the ship to manage a long distance relationship through handwritten letters, voice
[01:01:32] messages on cassette tapes and an occasional phone call.
[01:01:36] The second parting for my family was worse than the first.
[01:01:39] I didn't want to be a stranger to my own daughter but what choice did I have?
[01:01:43] The Navy wanted me to go.
[01:01:44] The Navy needed me to go to the other side of the Pacific.
[01:01:47] It was my sworn duty to go.
[01:01:55] After ten years flying fighters, now you're on deployment.
[01:01:58] After ten years of, and I'm fast-forwarding.
[01:02:00] After ten years of flying fighters, I felt ready and confident.
[01:02:03] I'd ace the F4 training at VF-121, the West Coast Replacement Air Group Rag for the
[01:02:09] Phantom community.
[01:02:10] The squadron prepared all new F4 crews for their Vietnam deployments.
[01:02:14] We flew constantly training hard at our beyond visual range missile intercepts.
[01:02:20] We even got to shoot at a drone with a sparrow, one of the only times I'd actually
[01:02:25] fired one of these high tech weapons.
[01:02:28] So you guys get the F4 fan of now.
[01:02:31] I think that's my favorite American aircraft.
[01:02:34] I don't know.
[01:02:35] I'm actually sure it is my favorite American aircraft.
[01:02:39] I guess the second maybe the Coursaire, the World War II Coursaire.
[01:02:43] Obviously, but then you got the P-5.
[01:02:45] Okay.
[01:02:46] We'll go down that.
[01:02:48] But you're flying the F4 fan of.
[01:02:50] And that's once again, this is the space craft on bus.
[01:02:55] That's beautiful.
[01:03:00] That's the bird that they have at Pensacola.
[01:03:01] Did you go to Pensacola Dave?
[01:03:02] I did.
[01:03:03] Yeah.
[01:03:04] That's the bird that they have in the like the premier spot at Pensacola, the big
[01:03:09] giant one sitting where you marched by every day.
[01:03:13] So that's what you're flying.
[01:03:14] And now you're on deployment.
[01:03:18] You go to Pearl Harbor for a little while after a few days in Pearl, we were on a way
[01:03:21] west to Sassabo, Japan, our rival was met by massive protests, student and radicals opposed
[01:03:30] to the Vietnam War.
[01:03:32] When the carrier or a scony, how you say that?
[01:03:35] A risk in me.
[01:03:37] When the carrier or a risk in me called it Sassabo, around the same time we did, we learned
[01:03:42] that its air wing had lost half its aircraft over North Vietnam.
[01:03:49] It suffered a third of its air crews either killed, wounded, or missing in action.
[01:03:54] Their casualty list eventually included Lieutenant J.G. John McCain, future senator from Arizona
[01:04:00] who is captured in October 1967.
[01:04:05] Only a few weeks before our ships crossed paths, one of the F8 pilots, Lieutenant Commander
[01:04:10] Dick Sheifert, fought an epic duel against six North Vietnamese megs, 17s and meg 21s.
[01:04:16] It had been escorting an A4 Skyhawk strike when they were attacked, Sheifert fired all
[01:04:21] three of his side-winder missiles, but each malfunctioned or missed.
[01:04:26] When he switched to his 20-millimeter cannon, the hijie maneuvering jammed the pneumatic
[01:04:31] feed system, leaving him defenseless.
[01:04:33] Nevertheless, he stalemated the migs with an exceptional display of flying before slipping
[01:04:39] away on the dregs of his remaining fuel.
[01:04:41] The fighters showed up a moment later and downed one of the migs, they fired seven missiles
[01:04:46] in that fight, only one hit.
[01:04:53] So this is where, and you're going to, the history in this is awesome, talking about the
[01:04:58] weapon systems, talking about the failures you're talking about.
[01:05:01] It's not only the pilots, not getting trained the way they should be, but the weapon systems
[01:05:05] aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing.
[01:05:08] This idea of intercept fighting was, hey, we're going to stay 12 miles away.
[01:05:13] I lock on my missile system, I shoot it, and then I run away, and the missile does the job.
[01:05:19] That was what the plan was from the Pentagon, and from the brass.
[01:05:27] That's, you know, industry designs on the NA Billum, and we fly in what we're given.
[01:05:35] And each subject you've read about here is leading up to why top-cun was formed.
[01:05:44] In other words, the missiles never worked.
[01:05:48] They're big, they're expensive.
[01:05:51] How you handle them on the aircraft carriers, another problem.
[01:05:55] They're all problems.
[01:05:57] You know, somebody paid for them, they were paid for them, they sent them a fleet, and they
[01:06:01] don't work.
[01:06:02] But in peace time, you never use them in anger, so you don't know that.
[01:06:09] The Phantom was designed one way, Mac Billed a beautiful airplane, but it was designed
[01:06:16] as an interceptor.
[01:06:18] We had never had it in combat.
[01:06:22] And all these situations you're talking about lead to top-cun failure make it better right
[01:06:31] now.
[01:06:33] The time frame they gave us was two months, but the graduate school together, we've
[01:06:39] been doing this for five years of war in the name working.
[01:06:43] So you could even be a couple months, put a graduate school.
[01:06:48] Initially, though the original nine guys or eight guys who were with me, we were trying
[01:06:55] to figure out whether we were getting sandbagged, you know, whether somebody was setting
[01:07:00] us up, you believe it on young guys, they couldn't cut it.
[01:07:05] Well, we didn't turn out quite that way.
[01:07:09] So anyhow, all I want to make point is a lot of what you're reading is how and why
[01:07:18] and top-cun ended up and the more about there.
[01:07:22] Yeah, I know it's the way you lay the pieces out of how it comes to fruition is history.
[01:07:27] I don't think a lot of people know about it.
[01:07:30] No, they only know about the movie, top-cun original movie.
[01:07:38] There's a little situation, a little scenario that unfolds in Korea.
[01:07:43] There's a little problem and you end up having to go up there and you arrive on stage,
[01:07:51] you're going back to the book, we arrive on stage to face terrible winter weather.
[01:07:54] We sailed through blizzard and snow squalls that left us unable to see the end of the flight
[01:07:59] deck from the ship's island.
[01:08:01] The flight deck turned out to be covered in ice.
[01:08:03] The crew had to assist us to our F4 fanom so we didn't slip and fall.
[01:08:08] Once in the cockpit, we were towed to the catapult so we didn't slide around on the ice.
[01:08:12] A night cat shot is always an experience.
[01:08:16] Add snow flaries and heavy seas and you've got a real adventure.
[01:08:18] We climbed it once you launched it.
[01:08:21] We climbed above 20,000 feet but never broke free in the storm.
[01:08:25] It was so thick that Skank and I couldn't even see each other.
[01:08:28] My back seat or dentist stuffy tracked him on radar and we followed a few miles behind.
[01:08:32] Snow and ice last our fanom's.
[01:08:35] The wind screen was a kaleidoscope of snowflakes.
[01:08:37] It was like flying through a snow globe.
[01:08:39] The enterprise finally vectored us to a holding pattern before we returned to the ship.
[01:08:44] As our approach time grew near, I thought it strange that they never gave us a weather
[01:08:47] report.
[01:08:48] We started our dissense individually through the heart of the blizzard.
[01:08:52] Visibility was almost nil.
[01:08:54] Skank went into land first guided by radar from the ship. He saw nothing on that first approach.
[01:09:00] He saw nothing on that first approach.
[01:09:03] No lights, no carrier, just blizzard and blackness.
[01:09:07] This landing signal officer said, you sounded good when you went by us.
[01:09:13] When he finally landed Skank and the landing signal officer talked to me as I swung around
[01:09:17] the ship again.
[01:09:18] Stay low, follow the ship's wake.
[01:09:22] I got down close to the water as I dared 40 feet.
[01:09:24] Maybe the flight deck is set to at 65 feet off the swells.
[01:09:28] A red light began flashing in my cockpit.
[01:09:30] Low fuel.
[01:09:32] This was it.
[01:09:33] Either land or eject into the frigid seas and see how good our survival suits really were.
[01:09:39] Our life expectancy in the freezing water was five minutes.
[01:09:42] No thanks.
[01:09:43] In the darkness I found the carriers white-wake and followed it until I spotted the drop lights
[01:09:47] on the ship's stern ahead.
[01:09:49] They were above me.
[01:09:51] The landing signal officer told me to climb.
[01:09:53] I pulled the nose up as the fanom's nose top the ramp.
[01:09:56] I pushed the stick forward and an instant later pulled back up.
[01:09:59] This was an old trick.
[01:10:00] A World War II ace named Zika Kormier taught me.
[01:10:03] It saved my mind and Dennis' life that night.
[01:10:07] The fanom touched the deck.
[01:10:08] The tail hook caught an arresting wire and we jerk to his stop.
[01:10:12] As we waited for the deck crew to clear us my knees trembled and my feet shook on the
[01:10:17] brake pedals.
[01:10:18] Of all the flying I'd done to this date this was the most demanding.
[01:10:22] Why somebody in Washington wanted us in the air that night is anyone's guess.
[01:10:27] I can't think of what we accomplished in our 90-minute story.
[01:10:30] Other then perhaps impress the North Korean radar operators who undoubtedly tracked our
[01:10:36] progress through the weather.
[01:10:38] We had wrist our lives for nothing.
[01:10:41] Who were these politicians to play games with our lives?
[01:10:48] That sort of mandated operation happens far too frequently.
[01:10:57] Even today they never been there.
[01:11:02] They couldn't do it.
[01:11:04] They've got the power.
[01:11:07] That's a problem.
[01:11:08] I have emotionally I've tried to think about a book of how to, how to the military historically
[01:11:18] has always been subservient to the politicians in Washington.
[01:11:24] If you look at the entire Vietnam situation, LBJ and Mac Tamara and the way they dictated
[01:11:33] what we did every day.
[01:11:35] I would never, ever, ever convinced me that what they were doing was the end result was
[01:11:44] to win.
[01:11:45] We went along the win.
[01:11:48] I kind of breeze through the section in the opening of this when you're talking about
[01:11:52] the fact that you guys are hitting targets that you're getting from the White House, from
[01:11:57] the Pentagon.
[01:11:58] That's who's doing your target selection.
[01:12:02] Totally crazy.
[01:12:04] And they're coming from Magnum or his office.
[01:12:07] We'd find out, they'd come in on a wire about midnight.
[01:12:12] The ships would put out an airplane for the next day.
[01:12:17] But the targets were being dictated from Washington.
[01:12:21] And even since then, they come out that there's been testimony that that same target
[01:12:30] list was sent to the Swiss embassy.
[01:12:34] And the Swiss embassy had related to the North Vietnamese.
[01:12:40] The logic in DC was if they know where we're coming, we won't kill so much collateral
[01:12:50] damage.
[01:12:51] And this is a pretty good case that that actually happened.
[01:13:00] Imagine risking your life every day.
[01:13:04] By the way, the North Vietnamese, they don't care about civilians getting killed.
[01:13:07] They care about their mix.
[01:13:08] Well, that's what they care about.
[01:13:10] That's right.
[01:13:11] And they actually want civilians to get killed because then they can use that as propaganda
[01:13:15] against America.
[01:13:16] We could never, Chaco, we could never understand how they're going to be.
[01:13:21] The next day we'd go into the targets and they'd have moved the mobile same sites and
[01:13:29] AAA that were all on wheels.
[01:13:32] And they moved them into the targets that we were going to hit.
[01:13:35] And that's why I think you'll hear from most of the veterans of flu out there.
[01:13:40] It's probably that tough as air defenses, some in there ever gone against.
[01:13:45] You know, you go into it a little bit here.
[01:13:47] I got to read this part.
[01:13:48] It says, conceived in Washington by Secretary Defense Robert McNamara and approved by President
[01:13:52] Johnson, our bombing campaign was meant not to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war.
[01:13:56] It wasn't designed to demolish their air defense network so we could operate over North
[01:14:01] Vietnam, nom with impunity.
[01:14:03] It had nothing to do with tangible results or victory.
[01:14:06] It had everything to do with sending gradual messages to Hanoi.
[01:14:10] Where I'd expected to be the tip of the spear, we were instead the thumb and forefinger
[01:14:14] of Lyndon Johnson's gradual escalation of pressure on the North Vietnamese.
[01:14:19] We weren't allowed to apply pressure anywhere that it might hurt.
[01:14:23] We were only allowed just to pinch their metaphorical shoulder as a warning that if they
[01:14:28] didn't behave, we would pinch harder.
[01:14:32] What rolling thunder campaign was, the rolling thunder campaign was LBJ's personal
[01:14:36] Billy Club.
[01:14:37] He would send us to smack the North Vietnamese for sending supplies and troops to the
[01:14:41] insurgents, then order unilateral stand-downs known as bombing pauses to give the North
[01:14:46] Vietnamese time to internalize the punishment and heed its lesson.
[01:14:51] But the pauses just gave them time to rearm.
[01:14:54] The American response seemed only to emboldened Hanoi and convinced its leadership that
[01:14:58] we were more worried about the widening war and possibly fighting China or the Soviet Union
[01:15:04] than we were about defeating them.
[01:15:05] They used the bombing pauses to resupply and prepare for the next onslaught.
[01:15:10] A lot of Americans died as a result.
[01:15:13] Some were friends of mine.
[01:15:15] On Yankee Station, the Enterprise Air Wing learned that this, what this meant to individual
[01:15:21] air crews, Johnson McNamara, micro-managed the losing air war from Washington DC, going so
[01:15:26] far as to pick our targets.
[01:15:30] They were perhaps 150 worthwhile things to bomb a North Vietnam.
[01:15:34] Air fields, military bases, supply facilities, power plants, bridges, rail centers, oil, lubricant
[01:15:38] facilities, a few steel mills, and of course, high-fong's port facilities.
[01:15:43] Am I saying that right?
[01:15:45] High-fong?
[01:15:46] As both China and Russia wanted to be Hanoi's primary alley, they each tried to
[01:15:49] one up each other with military support.
[01:15:52] Large convoys of weapons and warm material flowed across the Chinese border to Vietnam.
[01:15:57] While the Russians have evolved tanks and surfaced to air missiles, systems via ships
[01:16:02] into the high-fong harbor, the enemy, thus had sanctuary to bring in what ever was
[01:16:08] needed for years.
[01:16:12] Afraid of escalating the war, the Johnson administration refused to sanction attacks on
[01:16:16] high-fong harbor or the shipping there.
[01:16:19] As we started to fly missions up North, up North, we would pass those cargo ships as they
[01:16:23] waited their turn to off-load at the docks.
[01:16:26] We could see their decks crammed with weatherized migs and surfaced to air missiles that
[01:16:32] would be shortly used against us, but we couldn't hit them.
[01:16:37] We couldn't mind the harbor either.
[01:16:39] What a tragedy.
[01:16:40] The simple execution of an off-the-shelf aerial mining plan long before perfected during World
[01:16:46] War II and carried out in three days could have shut down that big port.
[01:16:50] The only one of its kind in North Vietnam, but the word from the White House was no.
[01:16:56] Those big surface-to-air missiles as large as telephone poles would spear up into the sky
[01:17:00] after our airport, homing on their radar signatures.
[01:17:03] They took a heavy toll.
[01:17:05] We could sell them bomb the missile sites for fear we might kill their Russian advisors.
[01:17:11] When the North Vietnamese began flying Russian and Chinese-built make fighters, the Navy
[01:17:15] and Air Force asked Washington for permission to bomb their airfields, the request was denied.
[01:17:22] Categories of targets that could not be struck under any circumstances included dams, hydroelectric
[01:17:28] plants, fishing boats, sand pans, and houseboats.
[01:17:31] They also included significantly populated areas.
[01:17:33] After seeing the military value of these restrictions and North Vietnamese, placed most of
[01:17:38] their Sam support facilities and other valuable cargo near Hanoi and high-fong places where
[01:17:44] we were forbidden to strike.
[01:17:47] The airfields around Hanoi became sanctuaries for mix.
[01:17:51] The commander in chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp, who had overall
[01:17:58] responsibility for the air war, urged the joint chiefs to have to lift the crippling restrictions.
[01:18:03] Meanwhile, the enemy fighter pilots could sit on their runways in their planes without fear
[01:18:08] of attack, waiting to scramble when our bombers showed up.
[01:18:14] Eventually Johnson and McNamara cave to the pressure and allowed strikes on the airfields
[01:18:17] yet they might be mismatched even this, picking specific airfields and leaving others out of
[01:18:22] bounds.
[01:18:23] It was always necessary to virtually beg target authorization out of Washington, bit by peace
[01:18:31] Admiral Sharp wrote, instead of letting the navy launch a blitz that might break the
[01:18:37] bath back of the North Vietnamese air force, we hate a few air bases at a time while leaving
[01:18:42] the rest unscathed.
[01:18:52] I got to read this too.
[01:18:53] It was a setup for failure, you say.
[01:18:55] And it got a lot worse.
[01:18:56] Those rules of engagement negated the way we had trained to fight in the air.
[01:19:00] The value of RF4 phantoms was their ability to destroy airplanes and enemy planes from
[01:19:05] beyond visual range.
[01:19:06] The aim seven sparrow was the ultimate expression of that new way of fighting.
[01:19:11] Track and lock with the radar system loose the missile from 10 miles out and say goodbye
[01:19:15] to the make.
[01:19:16] This is how the navy trained us to fight.
[01:19:18] We abandoned dogfight training because of the navy's faith in missile technology.
[01:19:23] Most of our air crews didn't know most of our air crews didn't know how to fight any
[01:19:27] other way.
[01:19:29] We had our own rules of engagement kept us from using what we were talking.
[01:19:32] The rules of engagement specifically prohibited firing from beyond visual range.
[01:19:39] To shoot a missile at an aircraft a fighter pilot needed to first visually confirm it was
[01:19:43] a mig and not a friendly plane.
[01:19:46] The thought of an inadvertent or accidental shoot down of our brothers was of course intolerable.
[01:19:50] It did happen sadly in the heat of combat.
[01:19:53] Yet three years along the training squadron in California was still teaching long range
[01:19:57] to intercept tactics to the exclusion of everything else.
[01:20:01] Our training was not applicable to the air war in Vietnam.
[01:20:06] This played directly into the kind of the fight that make pilots wanted.
[01:20:09] The make 17 was a nimble fighter armed with cannons but no missiles.
[01:20:13] It was an old school derived from the Soviet lessons learned in the Korean war with such
[01:20:17] a plane the North Vietnamese needed to get in close and track our planes with their gun sites.
[01:20:23] They would sometimes wait to open fire until they were within 600 feet.
[01:20:28] Here we were trained in knock planes down at 10 miles.
[01:20:31] The F4 carried only missiles.
[01:20:33] It did not have an internal gun because contractors in the Pentagon believe the age of the
[01:20:38] dark fight was over.
[01:20:39] We brought our expensive high tech into this knife fight in a phone booth.
[01:20:44] The result, the make pilots scored a lot more heavily than they should have.
[01:20:51] The good read and again, I'm even when I'm reading chunks like that.
[01:20:58] I'm skipping over sections, you know, just to the history and you know, from a leadership
[01:21:03] perspective, this is a nightmare.
[01:21:06] It's a nightmare that there's no connection from the people that are making decisions
[01:21:11] to the folks that are on the frontline fighting.
[01:21:13] They're not listening to the feedback.
[01:21:15] It's a disaster.
[01:21:16] Their motives or their motives are different.
[01:21:23] You know, I really had thought about a book.
[01:21:26] I'm not good enough to write it.
[01:21:28] I don't think.
[01:21:29] But you've got the industry building weapons.
[01:21:35] Whatever they are, airplanes, park, and rules systems, everything.
[01:21:39] The industry is building them.
[01:21:42] What's their motive, profit?
[01:21:44] Then the American weapons, okay, I'll give them that.
[01:21:48] But mainly profit motive, then you can keep coming down the politicians.
[01:21:55] We know what their motives are like.
[01:21:57] And you come down to the poor guy who's flying in the machine.
[01:22:02] If it doesn't do the job that's required in the operational scenario you're involved in,
[01:22:09] you can lose.
[01:22:11] And losing is second best in tactics.
[01:22:16] Yeah, losing is dying.
[01:22:18] That's right.
[01:22:19] Exactly.
[01:22:20] You know, the other thing, and I go after Robert McNamara a lot, you say this.
[01:22:27] Robert McNamara is a numbers guy.
[01:22:29] And this is the thing, there's secondary effects.
[01:22:32] There's tertiary effects that happen when people are motivated by certain certain
[01:22:41] metrics.
[01:22:42] So here's what happens.
[01:22:44] Robert McNamara was a numbers guy.
[01:22:46] Under him, the Pentagon measured success in the ground war by the body count.
[01:22:50] Can you believe that?
[01:22:52] In the air, the air, the metric was the number of sorties flown over North Vietnam.
[01:22:58] One sortie equals one plane flying one mission.
[01:23:01] A ten plane raid resulted in ten sorties.
[01:23:04] This became a delusional world.
[01:23:06] A sortie counted in the total.
[01:23:09] Even if our bombers were forced to dump their payloads short of the target, which often
[01:23:13] happened when Meg's appeared, facing pressure to generate sorties, the carriers were worn
[01:23:19] and ragged.
[01:23:21] Aircraft handling crews worked 12 hours on 12 hours off, spotting and respawning the
[01:23:25] decks, launching strikes, recovering aircraft, arming and refueling the birds, racing
[01:23:30] to meet the sortie rate required of them.
[01:23:34] Such pilot flew twice a day with each mission taking several hours to brief and debrief.
[01:23:39] We flew to the edge of fatigue and beyond aviators who were shot down and recovered were
[01:23:45] back in action in a few short days.
[01:23:50] While the tempo took a heavy toll, it also led to the needless tragedies, including
[01:23:54] major fires aboard our carriers, the results of exhaustive crews making mistakes, scores
[01:24:00] of sailors and aviators died in those accidents and the fires on two carriers were serious
[01:24:04] enough to risk the loss of the ship.
[01:24:07] We were losing good men needlessly in the push to maintain the sortie rate.
[01:24:12] Why competition between services?
[01:24:15] With the Air Force and Navy battling fiercely for appropriations, both were determined to
[01:24:19] outdo the sorties the other flew.
[01:24:25] To put in perspective for your audience, I want to tell you a story.
[01:24:31] The skank that's in there in the story was up during the rescue of the Pueblo and
[01:24:38] skank Rimsson was a squirting commander.
[01:24:44] It's a front row guy never took a mission that he wouldn't lead and if they were tough,
[01:24:51] he was always there.
[01:24:53] That's why we were out together on that particular word back down in Vietnam during that same
[01:25:03] cruise.
[01:25:05] I wasn't with him this day, but this tells you the quality of the guy in the naval aviation.
[01:25:13] He's in over the beach in North Vietnam and he's a low-alditude and a rifle shot goes
[01:25:20] through the cockpit.
[01:25:22] He gets a flashy part of his legs.
[01:25:24] Both legs went through, come out the other side, lost in the console on the left side.
[01:25:33] He shot up in two legs.
[01:25:35] He retits down, pulls the garter's up, the garter's hold for the ejection seat, their straps
[01:25:43] that go around your calves.
[01:25:46] He brings him up, he turns his legs above his wounds, flies 140 miles back to the enterprise
[01:25:54] and lands aboard.
[01:25:57] This is T.S.
[01:25:58] Bremson, skank Rimsson, the squirting commander.
[01:26:03] He lands aboard the medic skitty moth at cockpit taking down the dock sewing up.
[01:26:09] Two weeks later, Jaco, he was back in combat flying with his squirting.
[01:26:16] He refused to be met with him and there are plenty of mothers like him.
[01:26:24] I know in your world, both of you, that you come out of there upon the guys like that,
[01:26:31] a great Americans, but they are poorly officiated up above them in many instances.
[01:26:41] When you get into, when you hit the part about how top-gone was put together, we were
[01:26:47] exposed to guys like this.
[01:26:49] We knew what the answers needed to be, some moment to it, it really knew.
[01:26:55] That's when I came from Genova, Lecha, Alex Varaeshu, Texanel, Skank Rimsson, Mentoring.
[01:27:06] We knew what the gun dancers were and they sure weren't sitting in the earring in a pentagon
[01:27:13] or in Congress.
[01:27:16] In this section here, you kind of detail the chapter title is Yankee Station Education.
[01:27:24] And it gives a good overview and again, I'm jumping ahead of some of the information
[01:27:30] you cover, but you say, day after day, we flew missions from Yankee Station to Hammer
[01:27:33] targets of questionable value.
[01:27:35] We bomb truck convoyes when we could find them on search and destroy mission.
[01:27:38] They move mostly at night and total darkness.
[01:27:40] We bomb supply, depose, and occasionally, when after power plants, as well as military
[01:27:44] barracks, long flattened by the squadron to have deployed before us.
[01:27:48] We went after bridges and sam sites.
[01:27:49] Very occasionally, we received permission from Washington to hit mega airfields around
[01:27:53] Hanoi.
[01:27:54] The F4 was designed from the ground up to be a mock-plus interceptor.
[01:27:58] It was supposed to be the bane of all Soviet built strategic bombers.
[01:28:01] Over Vietnam, the phantom became perhaps the most versatile multi-role aircraft America has ever
[01:28:07] produced.
[01:28:08] Still with its interceptor heart, it functioned as an escort fighter, utility strike bomber
[01:28:14] and south of the D. Militarizone, a close air-support aircraft.
[01:28:20] We were doing it all, learning on the job how to best carry out our missions.
[01:28:24] They were never the same.
[01:28:26] But the two days, over the north, usually one at night, left us worn out.
[01:28:31] The lack of quality sleep could also put our nerves on edge at time.
[01:28:34] We grew easily frustrated.
[01:28:36] Some people started to withdraw into the pressure.
[01:28:39] The exhaustion, the grief over losing so many friends.
[01:28:41] This didn't happen in my squadron.
[01:28:43] Skank and the other senior pilots set the example by flying almost all the difficult missions
[01:28:48] with the junior crews while never griping about the targets or the rules of engagement.
[01:28:52] They were great pilots as well as tremendous inspirations to all of us.
[01:28:56] Skank kept us focused and working as a team, taking care of each of us as we flew daily
[01:29:01] into harm's way.
[01:29:02] In our earwing, all the squadrons were led by example.
[01:29:06] It wasn't always that way as some other outfits experienced.
[01:29:09] We were losing guys to Sam's, Flaq, and even Migs, whose pilots well directed by radar,
[01:29:16] would launch slashing attacks into our formations.
[01:29:19] At the end of January, the North Vietnamese Army launched a major attack against a series
[01:29:23] of special forces outposts and the marine fire base at K-Song, which sat up on top of a flat
[01:29:29] top tail with all sides exposed.
[01:29:32] We launched late that afternoon and flew 200 miles to our marshalling station above K-Song.
[01:29:39] With the battle filling the surrounding valleys with gray box smoke, we had only glimpses
[01:29:44] of what was happening below.
[01:29:45] The airfield was a scene of carnage.
[01:29:48] Burnt out aircraft laid pushed to a side of the runway, victims of mortar broads.
[01:29:53] The base itself looked like a lunar landscape, with thousands of shell creators overlapping
[01:29:58] in the reddish, soft soil.
[01:30:00] I checked in with the marine forward air controller, whose job it was to guide us on the target.
[01:30:05] He was down there right amongst those young American kids and during the artillery
[01:30:09] broads is a night assault alongside them.
[01:30:11] With his radios and expertise, he was their fist of God.
[01:30:15] He was probably a marine aviator as well, so he spoke our language and understood our perspective.
[01:30:21] The forward air controller heard my check in radio call and responded immediately.
[01:30:25] The situation sounded dire from his description.
[01:30:28] North Vietnamese troops were massing just beyond the wire for another night assault, and
[01:30:32] he wanted me to hit thing with everything under my wings before darkness gave them the
[01:30:36] opportunity to attack again.
[01:30:38] The late day offered a rare cloudless sky, the blue stretching above me contrasted with the ugly
[01:30:43] coils of smoke and flame filling the valley under my phantoms nose.
[01:30:47] After receiving my instructions, I started down to begin my run.
[01:30:51] Keep your speed up, 500 knots, 400 feet, they'll be shooting at you.
[01:30:55] Called the forward air controller.
[01:30:57] Drop all your snakes on my signal.
[01:30:59] Remember, there are marines on the wire, just off your left wing.
[01:31:04] I leveled off at 400 feet, going 500 knots.
[01:31:07] The phantom spread through the clouds of smoke, from the hills to a right small arms
[01:31:11] fire erupted in my back cedar, Dennis Duffy and I could see the muzzle flashes.
[01:31:16] Moments later, red orange tracers lace the sky ahead of us and level with us.
[01:31:22] With my high speed, I wasn't so concerned with taking hints from the North Vietnamese troops
[01:31:25] on the right of us whose tracers were horizontal, but I was terrified of blowing the run
[01:31:30] and dropping my snakes on the marines near the wire by accident.
[01:31:36] Or an inexperienced navy pilot did just that by accident and wounded some of our men.
[01:31:42] The idea of killing Americans with a misplaced bomb, well, I knew I would never get over
[01:31:46] that if it happened.
[01:31:47] I listened carefully to every word that forward air controller said.
[01:31:51] If I wasn't exactly level, the bombs might fall right or left of the target area depending
[01:31:56] on where my wings were to the horizon.
[01:31:58] Holding steady while every bad guy with an AK-47 seemed to be shooting at me was no easy
[01:32:02] feet.
[01:32:03] Back it was the toughest flying I'd ever done.
[01:32:06] I checked my heading, wings level, a second later the forward air controller called
[01:32:11] drop, drop, drop.
[01:32:13] I pickled the Marquee de Tues, the F4 lurched upward as 6,000 pounds of bombs came off our hard
[01:32:19] points and began falling toward the ground.
[01:32:21] Simultaneously I pushed the throttle further and lit the burner.
[01:32:25] The fanom's twin J79 engines responded and we pulled with 5G's back to where we belonged
[01:32:32] far above the fray.
[01:32:33] Duff my back's seat or said, let's all ask Kim Osabe as we climbed my throat constricted,
[01:32:39] heart filled with dread while we waited to hear from the forward air controller.
[01:32:43] Toughest part of the mission is waiting for the results from the big, grunt FAC.
[01:32:48] Oh shit, did I just kill a bunch of Marines?
[01:32:51] No word from the air controller.
[01:32:53] The ultimate or need or kneel spun as we seared through 3000 feet.
[01:32:57] The seconds ticked off.
[01:32:58] No word behind me Dennis was twisted in his ejection seat trying to see where our bombs
[01:33:03] landed.
[01:33:04] Oh shit, the radio filled with static.
[01:33:06] Then the forward air controller's voice shouted, great run, great run, right on target.
[01:33:13] The Marines held and as a joint army navy, as a joint army marine and south Vietnamese
[01:33:19] rescue force battled up its way, its way up highway 9 to break the siege.
[01:33:24] The Enterprise Air Wing returned to its regularly scheduled programming over North Vietnam.
[01:33:29] We flew that day and night.
[01:33:31] We flew day and night in any kind of weather.
[01:33:33] We flew alpha strikes which were large on wheeled the raids of 30 or more planes.
[01:33:38] We have force provided escort against the mid threat or went to suppress air defenses while
[01:33:43] a 4 skyhawk attack planes struck targets.
[01:33:46] We flew 2 and 4 plane armed recumissions searching for anything worthwhile, Washington allowed
[01:33:53] us to bomb.
[01:33:58] There's not a person that knows anything about the military that hasn't heard about
[01:34:00] the case on the siege at case on.
[01:34:03] Wow, that's a crazy story from your perspective hearing it from your end.
[01:34:09] Well, it was so desperate.
[01:34:13] The siege was so bad by that time.
[01:34:17] They actually brought us in.
[01:34:19] The Marines at two lines and they were flying closer or sub-ort two.
[01:34:25] We didn't do that much of it navy guys.
[01:34:28] But it was, I had seen pictures of it.
[01:34:32] Recky pictures and so forth, reconnaissance.
[01:34:36] But to see it up close and then hear some guys down there on the wire with the guys who
[01:34:44] it endured a night in a major night at Vance by the North Vietnamese couple days before.
[01:34:53] I mean, this is serious business.
[01:34:56] Dave, you got to experience that.
[01:35:01] How good does it feel when you're on the ground and you're talking to somebody and you know
[01:35:07] you know what to say, you speak their language and then when you're in the air and you hear
[01:35:11] that person's voice and you're all right, I got you.
[01:35:14] I mean, listen to this is just, I mean, I'm kind of choked up just hearing you tell the story.
[01:35:22] I was, I was so lucky in my career to spend so much great time flying but that I got
[01:35:28] to live with Jocco's guys for about six months to run in the other side and I remember
[01:35:36] being told that we would, that type one cast was dead.
[01:35:40] I remember being told you'll never do it.
[01:35:43] And so even some of the same institutional things you dealt with and to be down there talking
[01:35:46] on my old squadron mates, doing type one gun runs in situations that I never thought I'd
[01:35:53] be and but how good it felt to do something to be honest, we didn't really want to be
[01:35:58] doing but to be down there and have guys that I knew from my old squadron is coming in
[01:36:02] doing gun runs and when those missions were over to go back and think man, like you said,
[01:36:07] I mean, the serious business, the fact that the Marine Corps let me do that, there was a lot
[01:36:13] of me that didn't really want to but that was the most powerful thing ever did in my 23-year
[01:36:18] career was use aircraft as fact to keep soldiers Marines and seals alive which to this
[01:36:25] day.
[01:36:26] How long were you on the ground or I didn't, I was a fact for one year I did seven months
[01:36:30] in Ramadi about six of it was what Jocco's team.
[01:36:33] Hey, listen, yeah, don't take for one second that I want you to think that what that story
[01:36:39] just told was my life, please don't and don't think that anything we did was remotely
[01:36:45] comparable to you, you know, what the guys on case on and what the guys in Vietnam, you know,
[01:36:50] we, we, you know, just not comparable.
[01:36:53] It's just not comparable.
[01:36:54] It's not a day even I and the rest of the guys in echelon front spend a lot of time talking
[01:36:59] about the fact that our combat experience is it's a real stretch to use the word combat
[01:37:06] experience when you compare it to a lot of the guys I've had on this podcast and a lot
[01:37:10] of, you know, and obviously hundreds of thousands of of service men and women that have
[01:37:16] done things infinitely, harder and more dangerous and with what much more sacrifice than
[01:37:23] anything that we did and that's why we just try and, you know, capture some of the lessons.
[01:37:31] I understand, but I also believe the most humble, most humble whether you're flying, whether
[01:37:41] you're a seal or a grunt and a core that most humble are usually the best warriors.
[01:37:48] I'm really find that in naval aviation, you know, rempton never would ever.
[01:37:55] You never even in the bar at night you'd never, you rempton tell that story upon himself.
[01:38:01] They're humble guys, but they're great Americans.
[01:38:05] Indeed, and that's the same way, you know, you get down, you listen and I look at a lot of
[01:38:10] your podcasts, a single event in your life, your jacco or your David, a single event can get you killed.
[01:38:21] Every event that you were involved in in your time and the service is important.
[01:38:29] You made it through that single event and you go on to the next one and that's why,
[01:38:35] well, I would get into it, but that's how the brotherhood, you know, why we top gun guys all
[01:38:41] call each other bro. There were original nine bros, we're coming to that.
[01:38:50] But rather that grew 600 bros. He's one of them and that's because they deal in each other's life
[01:39:00] day after day after year after year, if they're good. Yeah, now you've heard my lecture.
[01:39:11] Well, that was, you know, and I just kind of rattled off all the different types of missions that you
[01:39:17] guys were doing and I'm going to fast forward a little bit here. It says the missions continued
[01:39:23] as did the losses. There were nights, I got back to my bunk struggling with despair,
[01:39:29] seeing friends die as never an easy thing. At times you think you grow hard to it.
[01:39:34] Other times their deaths open wounds that the heart simply cannot heal. On those nights,
[01:39:40] I would crawl under the covers and lay there, unable to sleep despite my exhaustion, mind racing.
[01:39:46] Could we have done anything different? Could you have gotten out and we just didn't see the
[01:39:51] shoot? Fortunately none of them were from my squadron. I tried not to think about their families
[01:39:56] back home, but the faces of wives and kids would sometimes allude those efforts and they would
[01:40:01] come back to me in a rush. I found through my Navy career that some men revel in the challenge
[01:40:07] and rush of combat. That pace of off the Vietnam, it was their hunting ground. Me, I never got to that
[01:40:14] point. Combat was a responsibility, even a sacred duty. I took it very seriously, of course, but I
[01:40:19] never liked it. Those men I would never see again. Those families I would see too soon again.
[01:40:25] They were the cost of all that adrenaline rush. Others craved. That was a burden I couldn't
[01:40:31] carry and love at the same time. The enemy always had a say. And that was the wild card in combat.
[01:40:38] You could do everything right. Your division could do everything right. Your chain of command could
[01:40:42] make every decision and lead from the front like Skank did. Yet we faced cunning, devoted, and
[01:40:48] frankly courageous enemy who found ways to surprise us with new tricks. On those sleepless nights,
[01:40:54] my brain refusing to shut off. I would think of those empty wardrobe chairs. We lost some
[01:41:00] excellent pilots. All the talent in the world was not enough when fate called your number.
[01:41:11] You close this section out saying, in those sleepless nights, which most of us out on Yaki
[01:41:17] station had, we did our best not to think of home. You could make you cautious hesitant in the
[01:41:23] air, get you killed. If you were wrought wise, you never looked past the next dawn.
[01:41:30] Some combat vets would tell the new guys, assume you're never coming back, truly believe it,
[01:41:36] and you will make it home. It was a psychological paradox of battle.
[01:41:41] Yeah, there's a weird challenge. For a grunt, you're there. You're sleeping in the dirt,
[01:41:57] you're in danger. You get a use to it, you get numb to it, it's the reality.
[01:42:03] For you guys to be back safe on an aircraft carrier and then load into your aircraft and launch,
[01:42:11] that's a different cycle. And frankly, thinking about the guys that you lose,
[01:42:18] you have less time to do that on the ground. You're actively engaged. Even when we come back
[01:42:25] to base, we're planning for the next mission, and you know you're going out. But for you guys,
[01:42:31] like, you know, even if you do two missions, even if it takes you 12 hours, you got 12
[01:42:36] more hours in that day, you got to deal with. And that's a different, it's a different psychological
[01:42:41] challenge, I think. And the way you described it, it sounded like a different psychological challenge.
[01:42:47] And I will say, for me, the hardest part of doing a mission is waiting to go.
[01:42:55] That's the only time where I'd be like, all right, what, you know, that's one of my mind would
[01:42:59] start to race of did I think of everything? What go wrong? That's once you're on the mission,
[01:43:05] you're in the zone, you know, you're, I'm not, I'm not thinking about anything but getting the job done.
[01:43:11] But the hours before, four hours before, and you guys were in the perpetual cycle of
[01:43:17] waiting to go and not knowing if it was going to be your time or not.
[01:43:20] Well, that's the profession and evaluation. Nightcare landings always are exciting.
[01:43:35] And you had an opportunity to get a big, but it didn't work out, what happened with that one?
[01:43:41] Um, Remson and I and two other guys were vectored in hot ready to shoot and a follow my leader
[01:43:53] at 12 miles, we're all locked up, a good, ready light or need fire.
[01:43:59] And it was very rare that we didn't, we weren't bound by the rules of engagement.
[01:44:05] We were cleared to fire 12 miles, Remson decides, we're going to sweeten the pot. So we go to 10 miles,
[01:44:13] eight miles, and about 10 miles, we're going pretty fast, you know what I mean?
[01:44:22] We get the call of salvo, salvo, salvo, salvo, from a red ground, which was the offshore air
[01:44:30] controller and salvo means get out of there and they don't specify why. So Remson, we cross,
[01:44:38] turned it, turned away and let these make 21s, which were coming down the pipe at us.
[01:44:47] We had to, we had to not fire. Now, two things could have happened. They could have been,
[01:44:54] friend, at least, red crowns made mistakes on occasion. It's radar interpretation,
[01:45:01] some distance. So that was immediate reaction. And then we hear, I was to God to hurt it.
[01:45:09] The thunder go over the top, there's a rolling thunder going over the top. And the long beach
[01:45:15] had fired Taylor's missiles and it shot him right over the top of us. You talk about being angry.
[01:45:27] We got back to the boat and landed and found out what it was. And they shot down one and got
[01:45:33] a probable one a second, make 21, which belonged to Remson and better. It's a, it's a crap
[01:45:42] shoot. Yeah, you know, on a given day, do you get a chance that you train in years war? And
[01:45:53] that one our day, so you want to get ready for the next day, like you say.
[01:46:02] Eventually, you get to this point and again, I'm fast forwarding through stories and
[01:46:09] details and personnel just awesome history. You get to this point. We were worn out, beat up,
[01:46:18] and bitter. Between the end of February and the end of June, our 100 man air wing had lost 13
[01:46:26] killed or captured. 10 bombers on F4 and a vigilante reconnaissance plan playing. Something was
[01:46:33] very, very wrong. If we were going to regain the dominance that was Naval Aviation's birthright,
[01:46:39] we would need to make changes. My orders were cut. I'd been assigned to the Phantom Fleet
[01:46:44] Replacement Squadron at Naval Air Station, Miramar, as luck would have it there. In the bustling
[01:46:50] on-clave of Fighter Squadron, 121, I would have the chance to help solve our costly, tragic problem.
[01:46:58] So you get to Miramar. Fall 1968, Fighter Town USA. That's the longstanding nickname of the
[01:47:09] Naval Air Station, who Spanish name Miramar doesn't even seem to suit the place. There's no
[01:47:13] view of the sea from its location, 15 miles north of San Diego, five miles in from the coast,
[01:47:19] at least not until you've gone wheels up and you're flying west on that air controllers.
[01:47:23] Well, what the air controllers call a sea wolf departure. Know the unofficial nickname painted
[01:47:28] on Hangarwon is a much better fit. On the runways, ramps and taxiways of the sprawling complex,
[01:47:34] the shriek of jet engines and the smell of aviation fuel is constant. If my love of flight had
[01:47:39] been tested by war, I still never shook the habit of lifting my eyes to the sky whenever a jet
[01:47:44] roared overhead. Who was it? How was he doing? What's going on? As an instructor, it was my job
[01:47:49] to keep track of my nuggets. When I parked my sea bag at Miramar again, this time to serve as a
[01:47:54] tactics instructor at Fighter Squadron 121, I found the pace of daily life, clipping along at a
[01:48:00] fast wartime tempo. The whole West Coast Naval shore establishment had ramped up to support the
[01:48:05] war in Vietnam and VF 121 was hauling a heavy load. I was an instructor in the advanced tactics phase
[01:48:12] of the squadron. A good man, Lieutenant Commander Sam Leeds was the head of tactics.
[01:48:21] Well, again, I'm jumping through some stuff here. What kept us from pushing the aerodynamic
[01:48:26] limits? Because you talk about what you guys were doing to train and then you kind of have a caveat
[01:48:32] that you weren't pushing as hard as you wanted to. What kept us from pushing the aerodynamic limits
[01:48:36] was the risk of version that commonly afflix training. The worst thing we could do as far as our
[01:48:42] higher headquarters was concerned was lose a plane. So twice a day, I took new fanom pilots
[01:48:49] and their back seaters up to fly. We played it safe. We did air combat maneuvering or ACM,
[01:48:55] but always within strict safety parameters. As a result, the program lacked combat realism.
[01:49:01] The first time rag pilots saw the radical maneuvers that modern jets were capable of.
[01:49:05] Tracers were flying. The rise had not been opened. That's not how you want to send a young man
[01:49:16] after off to war. So you guys are training within some pretty strict confines.
[01:49:24] And it's crazy to think that the first time a guy is really going to be able to test
[01:49:28] is to maximize the maneuverability and the capability of the aircraft is going to be in combat.
[01:49:35] It's ridiculous. But doing it for five years.
[01:49:41] Luckily, not long after my arrival in late December, Sam leads call me into his office and
[01:49:46] showed me a thick document bound in a blue cover. It was a study issued by the Naval Air Systems
[01:49:51] Command. It's title, report of the air to air missile system capability review hardly sounded like a blockbuster.
[01:49:59] But this study produced by Captain Frank Alt, the captain of the coral sea, was an impressive
[01:50:04] consequential piece of work. About 200 pages long, it was a top to bottom exploration of the
[01:50:10] reasons for our failure in air to air combat over North Vietnam. Captain Alt's project had been a
[01:50:16] long time coming. It began in the summer of 1968 when he led a team that tackled the problem of
[01:50:20] the Sparrow missile. Building on that and other studies, he pulled in more than 200 people to a
[01:50:26] symposium at the Naval Air Missile Test Center at Point Magu North of Los Angeles.
[01:50:31] There were pilots, commanders, and managers, and technicians from Raytheon Westinghouse,
[01:50:36] and McDonald Douglass, all the major fighter weapons contractors, no one had put together the
[01:50:42] entire picture of the problem like Alt had. It was the first time the whole air combat system
[01:50:48] our fighters, their missiles, and fire control systems had been studied holistically from design and
[01:50:55] acquisition to operations and logistics. Alt wanted to understand weapon systems from the womb to
[01:51:00] the tomb as he liked to say. His conclusions were far reaching. Sam leads called my attention to one
[01:51:06] particular recommendation in the report. He flipped a page 37 and pointed to the 11th of the 15th
[01:51:13] items listed in paragraph 6, air crew training. It was there that Alt advised the chief of
[01:51:20] Naval Operations and the commander of Naval Air Forces, Pacific, to establish as early as possible
[01:51:26] and advance fighter weapon school at NAS Miramar for both the F8 and the F4.
[01:51:34] These were the words that gave birth to Top Gun.
[01:51:37] Sam and I knew that any Miramar based tactics training program would run through us. He looked
[01:51:44] at me and said, Dan, why don't you take it? I suppose this was generous of him. He had both
[01:51:49] experience and seniority over me. He could have led the effort himself, but he had already had a great
[01:51:54] job waiting for him. He was in the final running to command the first fighter squadron that would
[01:51:58] fly the new F14 Tomcat. Sam could have easily taken the assignment to start a new school house,
[01:52:04] to start a new school house and then he handed off to me when his time came to fly the F14s,
[01:52:09] but he felt the school should have the same leadership from the beginning for continuity sake.
[01:52:14] He said as much and strongly. It was settled then and there. I made it quick, faithful decision.
[01:52:20] I do it. And you're what? Lieutenant Commander right now? At this point? 31 years old, Lieutenant
[01:52:28] Commander, I was probably going above about 50 years old, tired, fatigue, and as a great opportunity.
[01:52:38] I mean, that is the best gift in a career somebody gave me. Frank Alt, the all report,
[01:52:50] Marvel's document, unsolicited. He did that on his own. It wasn't asked for.
[01:52:56] He told us what was wrong in detail, but he never taught. They've got blessing. He never
[01:53:04] mandated what to do about it. He just said, I want to graduate school. It's to get well program
[01:53:12] in the shortest amount of time. Somebody in endorsing him when it was approved and sent to 121.
[01:53:21] They put in two months and we don't have any space for you. We don't have a building. We don't
[01:53:30] have any airplanes. I don't have any support people, but you got two months to make the school.
[01:53:39] And teach a first class. Now this is a graduate school, Taco. This is not what we've been
[01:53:46] teaching for five years. Can you imagine the confrontation you're going to get from the existing
[01:53:55] squad and commanders? I don't know. And these are O5. The squadron commanders at this time were
[01:54:00] they O5. So you're juniored all these guys. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. It will be all on the
[01:54:07] what that's like. Yeah. You say soon we started calling the school top gun. We weren't the first to
[01:54:12] use this nickname. There was an annual weapons competition that used the same name until about
[01:54:17] 1958. The aircraft carrier Ranger, which I would later command called itself the top gun in the
[01:54:22] Pacific Fleet. You can't. You can't write every day Navy fighter weapons school. You got to
[01:54:32] have a nickname and top gun just seemed to work. That's it. And they liked it. You had to, you know,
[01:54:46] you had the goal of top gun wasn't just to teach pilots, but to make those pilots kind of
[01:54:52] teach into teachers themselves. Oh, that's it. That's the answer. It's like a teachers college.
[01:54:59] In other words, you got to teach people that are going out of the fleet in the solicitation. We did
[01:55:07] in the initial solicitation to bring in students that send your two best. The two best nuggets
[01:55:17] or Lieutenant's or below from your squadron. I mean, of course, some of the some of the
[01:55:23] reaction, we don't want to put it on tape here. But the idea was those two guys who come back,
[01:55:33] we'd form a cat in about six weeks. We'd teach in graduate school and they go back out and they teach
[01:55:43] their entire school under the new tactics. So it's colorful. You uh, the lore behind this is awesome.
[01:55:54] You you go into selecting the first originally you call them. And I have to at least just kind of
[01:56:02] run through some of the highlights. The stories you got behind these guys are awesome.
[01:56:06] Uh, Mel Holmes, the first round pick by anybody's book. One time Mel was golfing at Basin,
[01:56:13] of course, in Merimar, he had a drive into the weeds. That was bad news for the nest of rattle
[01:56:17] snakes he walked into while looking for his ball. When his buddies saw him hacking away with his
[01:56:22] seven iron slaughtering those serpents in the grass, Holmes had his nickname, Wrathler. He had one
[01:56:28] trait in spades that I strongly doubt is teachable, a bone deep, hardwired electric fire sense of aggression.
[01:56:35] I chose John Smash Nash for the way his heart mined work together. Any suggestion that a
[01:56:42] mismatch was at hand triggered his compited his competitive fire. His motto, I'd rather die than
[01:56:47] lose, bore it out. Most combat pilots were our wired that way. What Matt, what made Nash special was
[01:56:55] the way he combined that fire with hyper attention to detail. Jim Rullison, as I say that right?
[01:57:01] Jim Rullison probably put out more intellectual wattage than any of us. Jerry Sootsky, or Skiebert,
[01:57:10] as I called him, had played linebacker for Bear Bryant at Alabama. We appreciated him for being as
[01:57:16] reliable as gravity. And then so there's your pilots and then without a good backseater, you get into the
[01:57:23] the reos at the head of the pack was JC Smith, who I invited right away. He might have been the
[01:57:29] finest real there ever was. You also had Jim Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Lang? Is that right?
[01:57:36] Do you mean Lang? Say new. A youngster, just 23 years old, so quiet and person you'd never know,
[01:57:42] he was a tiger in the rear seat during his two combat tours in Vietnam flying from the Kitty Hawk.
[01:57:47] He and his pilot, named, flamed a Meg 17 in a wild fight near high fong harbor. Lang survived
[01:57:55] two ejections in barely a month. I don't even know what to say about surviving two ejections in a
[01:58:06] month. That's just crazy. You'd like to mean him. It'd be a good interview. Well, he's obviously
[01:58:12] open invite whenever he wants. I'll be standing by our other Smith Steve had all the
[01:58:20] essentials of a top grade reel that stood apart from everybody for his skills as a salesman,
[01:58:24] organizer and grifter for all seasons. Our junior Rio, Lieutenant Junior Grade, Darrell Gary,
[01:58:30] was the youngest man in a cadre of founders. He had every attribute I wanted instructor,
[01:58:34] mature beyond his years, confident beneath his years and very hard working. Last find was Chuck
[01:58:40] Hilderbrand and he was an intel guy. So you brought him to help you guys with the intel side of
[01:58:47] figuring out what other aircraft consisted of what they're capable of. One to become the
[01:58:54] central repository of tactical aviation within Navy. Navy had none of them. They were classified
[01:59:03] at all. It's over CIA, CIA headquarters, up to that point. So I wanted to build it and it
[01:59:10] works that way now. And you guys basically did you basically steal a trailer for this organization?
[01:59:16] That's a great story. You love it. We're just fussing our hump to get ready in two months.
[01:59:25] There's no op order for this. There's no plan. It's winging it. Whatever, whatever is fair,
[01:59:34] just do it and get it done. The individual guys had and I've been flying with these railies
[01:59:41] often on. And I learned from this railies when you got a lot done on a tight schedule. You
[01:59:48] have to do things. Get people that are intellectually or professionally excellent in given technical
[01:59:56] areas. So these guys all have their expertise to start with. And Steve Smith, who
[02:00:08] probably should be a felon, and he's a wealthy one with that now. But at the time, you know,
[02:00:16] he gave, he'd make a list of things to do every day. And by he and I'd work together in early
[02:00:24] morning and by evening time and this got all done. Is that kind of guy? Get it done.
[02:00:32] Personal, great. And one Friday early in the morning, I said, damn, I said, we're really moving
[02:00:41] forward. Paperwork wise. Plan why? And the taxi. Really looking good. But I said, we don't even have
[02:00:49] a place to start holding formalizes thing. And I said, but I got an idea. So I sat him down
[02:01:00] behind Bay Sobs at Mermort. And he comes back on Saturday morning with a big 40 foot crank
[02:01:08] hanging below it. Is a 20 by 40 building, which is a pictures that are in the book of the original
[02:01:17] he had stolen this thing. He had brought the crane operator with a case of Scott to which I
[02:01:23] ended up buying. And they bring it down. And you know, the pace of things was such that I said,
[02:01:35] you got what? And the guys were all laughing. Whole place was laughing. Go out. And here's a
[02:01:41] CEO's parking spots all along the street. And here's his crane with his big building. Suspended
[02:01:49] below it. He said, where do you want to put it? I said, you put it right here by the steps leading
[02:01:56] up to fight her down hangar, but right here right above the CEOs parking spot. One 21. And we
[02:02:05] got away with it. So Sunday he says, I got a bunch of flooring. We're going to put new flooring
[02:02:11] in the building today. So everybody came in and we hammered nails and glued down new flooring in there.
[02:02:20] And he brings in red paint. And we painted the trim on the building. All red. I said,
[02:02:27] what an hell is you do it in red for? He said, who would believe you'd steal a building and paint
[02:02:35] red. This is a mentality that you're dealing with. And and by God Monday morning,
[02:02:42] income some vans that Nevada license plates. And I think he had been up to Nellus and stole
[02:02:51] a bunch of salvage furniture from the Air Force. But he brought in desks and chairs and
[02:02:59] and in safe. He got a couple of safe. This was a kind of guy. And it whipped it out three days.
[02:03:09] We started we started the classroom then. That's epic. You say here, before we could teach
[02:03:19] the material, we had to study and learn it called ourselves. We created, collated,
[02:03:23] and corrected the curriculum at a fever pace, working all hours to refine it, hunting and
[02:03:29] packing with two fingers on manual typewriters, redlining each other's drafts for hercing lectures to
[02:03:33] each other. This last part was key as we took turns on the podium and the trailer. We faced
[02:03:39] we faced withering scrutiny from our fellow instructors in the military. This is known as a
[02:03:43] murder board. No hiccup in presentation style. No slip of the tongue. No glitch in dress or personal
[02:03:50] appearance was too small to be seized upon and corrected on the spot. We knew we would be ineffective
[02:03:56] lecturing our top not students if we were anything less than bulletproof. How would they believe
[02:04:00] us at top going if we couldn't deliver graduate level lessons well? In the meantime, we began
[02:04:06] reaching out to the fleets squadrons to recruit their students. It's interesting to me. I found
[02:04:10] that part. Interesting that you guys went hyper professional. You went, hey, we are going to be
[02:04:17] over the top professional because you could see the attitude, hey, we're doing this. We're kind of
[02:04:22] flying by the seat of our pants. I will teach you kind of half-hazard. You guys went hyper professional.
[02:04:27] That was an awesome move. In the forward to the book, the Edeliments and then murder boarding
[02:04:37] has a night element. It took us a while to analyze. We we-we-wined it to get it going. But once we
[02:04:46] got it up in it with successful, we had to set the standards high because nobody believed you know,
[02:04:55] it was the same type of thing that we had been doing for five years. It wasn't going to fly.
[02:05:01] But just make it special and it's still that way. Is it not? 100%. 100% that legacy has
[02:05:10] sustained from the beginning. In the elements are in the forward to that book. No. And they're
[02:05:17] applicable to commercial enterprise. You'd be amazed who I've lectured on those. I wouldn't be
[02:05:23] as I wouldn't be surprised at all. I know the, I know that the principles that we learned in the
[02:05:31] military are extremely applicable to any leadership situation. Sorry. You're just about to start
[02:05:40] the first class. And you say this, I was cooking along in full afterburner about 100 miles off the
[02:05:45] California coast approaching San Clemente Island when I felt the thump. My warning panel lit up.
[02:05:50] There was a fire in my right engine. As I shut it down, my back seat or lieutenant J. G. G. Gill
[02:05:56] slimy ran through the emergency checklist while Mel eased in close for a visual inspection
[02:06:02] trying to see through all the smoke. We were about 30 miles from Miramar, off La Jolla,
[02:06:07] when the seven-liter liquid auction canister mounted in the tail of my phantom exploded.
[02:06:14] It tore the tail section clean off my bird and over and we tumbled,
[02:06:18] time slowed down. We plummeted. In my headset, I think I heard Mel's voice,
[02:06:24] Dan, you guys eject, eject, Gill pulled the handle and we rocketed out of the doom jet.
[02:06:31] We fell toward the ocean strapped into our ejection seats at 21,000 feet.
[02:06:36] It's odd how time passes in a crisis inspired by the flood of adrenaline into my system.
[02:06:40] I'd time to look down over La Jolla, notice the scenic curve. My helmet visor was gone,
[02:06:45] but somehow my Ray-Band sunglasses were still hanging on. I've got to save them, I thought.
[02:06:50] Those sunglasses had been with me since my Pensacola training days. No way did I want to lose them
[02:06:54] now. I reached up, shook them off my face and stuffed them into a zippered pocket on my flight suit.
[02:07:00] It was then that I realized as I fell through space that I was still attached to my ejection seat.
[02:07:05] This was a problem. The heavy apparatus was supposed to separate automatically by action of a
[02:07:10] powerful spring activated by barestad at 12,000 feet. Falling toward the sea, I looked around for
[02:07:16] Gill's shoot and was relieved to see him drifting down behind an above me. This engaged myself,
[02:07:23] disengaging myself manually from the ejection seat and falling clear, I pulled the D-Ring to pop my
[02:07:28] shoot. Nothing happened. I yanked it again harder and the cable broke off in my glove hand.
[02:07:34] I was falling at terminal velocity 14 feet per second like a rock.
[02:07:39] Somehow I had to get my hands on the shoot pack. Short on time and altitude, I pulled myself
[02:07:45] up the risers and reached my shoot pack. I thought of my wife and kids and home and it was
[02:07:50] God who gave me the strength. I'm sure reaching the parachute pack, I opened it with my hands
[02:07:56] and the shoot flew free. The beautiful white blossom swelled above me jerking me upright into a lazy
[02:08:04] but short descent. Thank you, my dear Lord. Is that your first ejection? Only. Only ejection.
[02:08:14] You had to climb up the risers of your parachute and yanked that thing out. That's very
[02:08:19] different. Okay. It was not a big deal to have a malfunctioning parachute after you ejected out
[02:08:27] of your F-4 fan and with the engine exploded. I was going to be impressed.
[02:08:33] The next line gets even better. Yeah, looking down at the cold water, I saw the dark,
[02:08:39] sleek shadows swimming just below the surface. Yeah, people don't, I mean you're off the coast
[02:08:46] of Southern California. There's sharks. There are and actually people know this now because you
[02:08:53] know we have drones flying around and now that they fly drones all over the place, people are all
[02:08:58] shocked that there's a bunch of sharks out there like I'm a surfer and people are now realizing,
[02:09:03] oh there's sharks right off the coast of where we surf and you know I said the sharks have always
[02:09:10] been there. That's their home, you know. So you can kind of visualize some sharks as you were
[02:09:16] inbound? Well, I looked down and they saw the silhouette in the dark and this was 15 minutes
[02:09:23] for dark and the water's cold, 13th of February and so I hit the water and then my little raft
[02:09:34] disinflated so I climb in this, because I can, it's cold man and I think I was motivated by the
[02:09:45] thought it was probably sharks turns out it was dolphin because where my big boots were sitting
[02:09:52] on the end of the raft, pretty soon boom, boom, two snouts turn up and these squeaky little levels
[02:10:00] were sitting there looking at me. You guys are probably swam with those people. And they're talking,
[02:10:07] they're children, they're excited to have somebody new and the world. I got rescued by heel
[02:10:14] that night. Yeah.
[02:10:18] March 3rd, 1969 in our stolen trailer at Fidertown USA Top Guns, Class One convened
[02:10:24] and I had to throw this in there. I issued a heartfelt welcome aboard and said we'd been
[02:10:30] charged with an important purpose. This is you talking to your students for the first time.
[02:10:34] I introduced my instructor team and told them who we all were. I explained that we would all
[02:10:38] learn together along the way. The main thing for any skipper to bear in mind is this. The troops
[02:10:45] know the troops need to know he's interested in their welfare. This is true regardless of the
[02:10:51] leader's personal communication style. Hard asses can care too. Some leaders give lip service to
[02:10:57] caring but what a leader does it does to show it is far more important. I wanted my instructors
[02:11:04] to challenge them but always constructively. We would aspire to build their confidence not destroy it.
[02:11:10] They were professionals and future mentors in training so we were going to show them how it was
[02:11:16] done. I close by saying there is an urgency here beyond anything we've ever done. We
[02:11:21] hold lives in our hands. These words still fill me with conviction today.
[02:11:27] So this was a like you said a graduate level school and you're treating these people more as peers
[02:11:33] than as you know people that weren't worthy of being there and that needed to bow down to you guys.
[02:11:42] None of that. There's a brotherhood in dealing and you guys know that.
[02:11:48] Dealing new in life every single day. Yours there's they knew why they were there.
[02:11:56] They were there to get better so they wouldn't go out and get themselves back.
[02:12:02] And their big because their sensibility a jaw-caught think is we made it known right from the
[02:12:13] first time they got the date they were there to become proficient teacher on score the mates
[02:12:22] and boy that stuck. They're pride. Pride and being the top gun instructor right David.
[02:12:29] It's not an easy way to get there sir.
[02:12:37] The pace of the program accelerated once we began flying a lot after the first week or so we ran
[02:12:42] two or three training sororities every day with the instructors playing the role of aggressors.
[02:12:46] We would put the students in different scenarios flying all the basic permutations.
[02:12:50] One versus one two versus one one versus two two versus two four versus two four versus four
[02:12:55] and two versus four. A dogfight is a true physical ordeal when a fighter aircraft is flown hard.
[02:13:00] It shakes you like a plummeting roller coaster on the verge of collapse. Your buffeted from side to side
[02:13:05] helmet hammering the plexiglass canopy harness digging into your shoulders and hips.
[02:13:09] GeForce is caused blood to surge and drain from your extremities including your head.
[02:13:14] Our program tested not only a student's body but his mind.
[02:13:19] Fast forward a little bit. There were a couple names for the mid-killing new tactics we developed
[02:13:24] in the F4 community. It basically involved flying a fan or fan of like a Saturn V rocket straight up.
[02:13:31] Sometimes we called it using the vertical envelope. It was also known as the high yo yo.
[02:13:36] But the name we settled on was inspired by the shape of the airspace we used while flying it.
[02:13:41] JC Smith called it the egg and the moniker stuck. That was the shape our fanom's track
[02:13:47] rocketing up and coming back down. So you guys are starting to come up with new tactics, new methods.
[02:13:55] The F4 is greatest attribute to magnificent Indians and it would go up and no
[02:14:05] makes ever stay way. We learned to fly. I'm flown zero air feet on the back up here.
[02:14:13] Just two pilot, free fighter and gauge fighter. One guy is down push in the makes.
[02:14:22] The other guy comes in and goes right to sweet spot to shoot. We got very good at it.
[02:14:29] And we flew the airplane way beyond what McDonald's was sold them for.
[02:14:38] So you're putting, are you putting this thing into a stall when you reach the apex of the
[02:14:43] vertical or you get close to it but you have to back off?
[02:14:47] She behaves, take her up to where you're comfortable and what you see down below.
[02:14:51] Sometimes you get really slow up here. Sometimes you go to zero and the airplane would behave so well.
[02:14:59] Use rotters not a lot. Aileron but rotters and I've flown the airplane straight into
[02:15:10] a piraticle to zero air speed. Full afterburner leave it there and come back down and we did it to
[02:15:17] make sure what the airplane would do in case you got up here and some nugget didn't get it over
[02:15:26] on its backside to fly straight up afterburner's going and cheat chugs and she didn't like it very
[02:15:35] much but she comes down just like this to fall through on her belly and goes out the bottom
[02:15:39] and name a McDonald's or an award. I'm going to stay with you through that and we did that and I made the
[02:15:46] guys each one of them. I went up and demoed it put a student in the back seat and made him
[02:15:55] getting a front seat and I climbed the back. No flight controls in the back seat at her point
[02:16:01] and I ride through that in the back seat and when that was over he is confidence was well.
[02:16:10] It worked great. That's a basic tag. Flung the vertical. You say flying every day we worked
[02:16:21] on all this and we worked hard we developed the egg in a way that made excellent use of our
[02:16:26] two plane loose-dose formation which basically with loose-dose talk talk us through the loose-dose
[02:16:33] formation a little bit. That's just two airplanes mutual support at the key okay. You got to be able
[02:16:42] to when you're cruising through Indian country you got to be able to keep them off your six
[02:16:47] you know when you get shot and you don't want you to get shot and from this position they can
[02:16:52] cross turn and they can clear each other or not more war to from reading and and so you get in the
[02:17:01] Indian country and you got mixed and you come through the merge maybe you're also a little bit
[02:17:07] but come through the merge and mix them down. You passed it and one of them becomes a free fighter
[02:17:16] he goes into vertical the other one comes around try and push and mix and you're trying to push
[02:17:22] them into predictability. Make drivers are like everybody they want to stay alive and some
[02:17:29] mummar very a degrees of expertise some mummar too good some mummar excellent you know the
[02:17:36] top-maked driver in Norvian I'm got nine nine vectors and serious business so any free fighter
[02:17:44] this guy up here would always try and come down it's a I'm in two's off or you know that's where we
[02:17:53] that's how we ended up with the call signs so we have because you can't can't relate numbers
[02:17:59] to each other you got to have a you know rivals in thanks off right when when the second aircraft
[02:18:09] goes starts to go up when the first aircraft comes down is in is the other one now taking the
[02:18:13] opposition yeah yeah it's keep track of the makes makes remember don't have the power to get
[02:18:19] up with the family and that they're in a lot of strength yeah so you keep pushing down there don't let
[02:18:25] them get fast just push them down and eventually one of you one potato two potatoes one of
[02:18:32] you will get a valid shot by the side one and oh god if I ever wanted anything in my flying
[02:18:39] bird I wanted a gun and a family never had a gun I know I could have won every fight with a gun
[02:18:50] gadlin gun this this concept of of the loose-dose formation you know even when you said mutually
[02:18:58] supporting you know in in ground tactics right we have the principle of cover move which means
[02:19:04] we're gonna work together when one person's moving the other person's shooting or you know
[02:19:09] keep in the enemy distracted yeah the allows the other person move to a better position a
[02:19:13] superior position you and they're gonna follow up the other interesting thing you said about how you
[02:19:17] could use ones and twos uh my first deployment to Iraq you know we had the humvies were numbered
[02:19:25] one two three four five six so you go out on target and everyone's assigned what vehicle you're
[02:19:30] gonna get into one two three four five six well because of the arranged so you go assault the target
[02:19:36] and the the vehicles would rearrange to so when you got back in and we could leave immediately
[02:19:44] well they wouldn't always rearrange in the right order and so what you'd end up with a guy that
[02:19:48] came in vehicle to he'd come out of an assault he'd look and he'd see vehicle number two and he'd
[02:19:53] go jump in it because he thought it was you know he'd count down the others number one there's
[02:19:56] number two I came in vehicle two well that that wasn't accurate and you'd have guys going to the
[02:20:00] wrong vehicles and so we ended up I said we're gonna name the vehicles and you're gonna know what
[02:20:06] vehicle you're in by name because that way hey if I came in big earn or whatever you know
[02:20:11] bigger and was the humvie I came in cool I get out I said I'm looking I'm not looking for a number I'm
[02:20:15] looking for big earn and that way my team is gonna be together we can get a quick head count same same
[02:20:20] idea yeah loose doose is that what you guys did two days it's almost exactly the same I mean
[02:20:28] the terminology is the same all the things he's talking about everything that that they are talking
[02:20:32] about has to stay into this day almost the exact same approach only anything changes is the
[02:20:38] opposition zero points your own airplane the weapon system that they're giving you to fly
[02:20:45] and that's therein lies the complexity of being a top-gun instructor because it's a constant
[02:20:54] dynamic they have got to work to stay ahead of the potential enemies if it'd be China if it'd be
[02:21:02] Russia everybody in the free world is working to keep their intelligence and their tactics
[02:21:13] revised if you will it's a full-time dynamic business hard work you say this about the loose
[02:21:24] doose the loose doose tactic reflected top-guns culture and this is why I called this out
[02:21:30] because it's not just the tactic that you use in the air which empowered junior officers to act
[02:21:35] and speak freely there was no leader wingman hierarchy in our tactics which left either fighter
[02:21:40] free to attack depending on who stage or depending on who cited a bogey first loose doose was
[02:21:46] a versatile and aggressive certainly was a far cry from the air force's tactic the fluid for which
[02:21:51] in spite of its adjective was quite rigid giving the initiative and most opportunities to the flight
[02:21:59] leaders life at top-gun was flight club every day as the instructors flew against the students it
[02:22:08] was natural for the students to want to take a scalp now and then if one of them beat Wrathler,
[02:22:13] Smash, Swatsky, Cobra, or me it could help his service reputation they seldom did it but by the end
[02:22:20] of the syllabus and its 26 flights it did happen there was plenty of pride to be taken in that
[02:22:27] I tried to keep them grounded everybody gets beaten now and then I told them if you managed to beat
[02:22:32] Mel and were smart you understood it was dangerous to pump your ego the lesson there was that if
[02:22:40] Mel could get beat anyone could I consider this attitude the heart of professionalism
[02:22:47] and why and as for my instructors from time to time I had to warn them no ego's fellow we're
[02:22:52] fellas we're here to teach that lesson right there of when you beat the best guy and you go yeah
[02:22:59] I just beat the best guy what the real lesson is you can get beat to that's a powerful thing to think about
[02:23:07] that's turning your ego right on its head but yeah you got a train to take on the best there is
[02:23:15] every time your your whole goal in training is to beat the very best if he comes comes out someday
[02:23:25] better be ready yeah when I was in charge of training seals for deployment
[02:23:30] the people that they fought against in training for deployment was other seals
[02:23:35] that knew their tactics that had the same conditioning that had the same weapons that
[02:23:39] actually knew what their plan was they they there's no one that would ever face a tougher enemy
[02:23:47] then you're gonna face going through seal pre pre pre deployment training the tougher on
[02:23:52] enemy does not exist that's really interesting it's the same exact attitude that you guys had you know
[02:23:59] and I I talked to Dave on the phone yesterday said this is the exact same attitude that we had in
[02:24:05] the seal teams is how do we push ourselves against the hardest possible situation we can be in
[02:24:11] so when we go in a combat it seems easy that's our goal make combat seem easy yeah
[02:24:18] well you can't lead you can't lead in good concepts if you don't train that way absolutely
[02:24:25] you can't be the leader no um there's a the next section you start talking about you kind of
[02:24:34] mentioned it earlier was was paradise ranch groomlake dreamland all the same names for
[02:24:42] something that probably most people have heard the name area 51 and out there will you
[02:24:50] talked about it you can you fly out there and these guys had a couple captured
[02:24:55] meaks my first one others a lot of things going on out there and we won't go into it but I went out
[02:25:03] there and flew I went out flew a couple tests I flew five six times I flew the meaks
[02:25:10] because I wanted the experience male homes and I did that and that was the first trip out and then
[02:25:17] later on when the first class graduated I surprised them I briefed the mission and we
[02:25:27] put them in I think I led and probably male led and we took them to dreamland unknown
[02:25:37] and we go smoking in the dreamland a nice easy 500 knots in the dreamland
[02:25:43] when ever where we go and what are we going to do you know a radio silence right here comes
[02:25:51] some makes the guys got to fight the makes for a graduation present and unknown
[02:26:00] and it's surprised to hell a lot of that is and you know they did they really got it all
[02:26:07] and they were good and they flew the tactics we had taught them and they held their own
[02:26:16] and then what a party we had a mirror my life yeah that's that's completely epic
[02:26:26] I didn't catch that right didn't recall it right yeah I probably didn't catch that the first time
[02:26:31] you did that they was surprised to them and they're just looking all the way positively
[02:26:35] I did it by a mic I just read coming those days and said you get we're going we get
[02:26:40] off in section section take off and I had three up with me I think I said just just follow me
[02:26:49] and I said be ready we go need knee and country that's all I told them and so they've speculated
[02:26:55] all the way out there speculated one they away what's the crazy man doing now
[02:27:00] so it was fun we get into this and there's a lot of connections here top gun couldn't
[02:27:11] avoid a rival with the US Air Force there wasn't about politics to us it was about flying
[02:27:16] and ideas sure it bothered us to hear the Air Force claim it had created the first
[02:27:21] fighter weapon school it's bad ideas that lose wars and get people killed the most vocal
[02:27:28] advocate of the Air Force thinking at that time was major John Boyd in 1969 he was making a lot of
[02:27:33] speeches promoting his energy maneuverability theory of air to air warfare simply put it's a
[02:27:39] mathematical formula that tries to reduce fighter aircraft performance to a single value based on
[02:27:45] the plane speed thrust aerodynamic drag and weight first put forward in 1964 it had reportedly been
[02:27:53] used by the Air Force to design new fighters such as the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 fighting Falcon
[02:27:59] outstanding planes as we all know in 1969 Mel and Skye gave a talk at Tindle Air Force base in
[02:28:07] Florida John Boyd followed them pitching his theory there was some good debate and Mel remembers
[02:28:13] Air Force officers starting to challenge their catacysm in the Q&A major Boyd made an infamous
[02:28:20] remark he said that no US pilot should ever dogfight a MIG because his theory proved mathematically
[02:28:28] that since the enemy plane performed better throughout the flight envelope than the F-4 taking on
[02:28:34] a MIG was a good way to end up hanging from a parachute or a whole lot worse the problem with any
[02:28:40] theory is the baggage of its assumptions we thought major Boyd was making some rather large ones
[02:28:46] and considered his analysis suspect as a result in the base auditorium Tindle at Tindle that day
[02:28:53] Skye poked Mel in the ribs why don't you say something rattleer Mel stood up and proposed to the
[02:28:59] Air Force officer that he was underrating a few things namely people Mel said that while weapons
[02:29:07] might have parameters and airplanes theoretical values no algorithm could predict much if it excluded
[02:29:15] the most important factor of all the skill, heart and drive of the pilot in the cockpit.
[02:29:23] The moment of truth was the merge it was then that you had your chance to take the measure of a man.
[02:29:30] Sir Mel said I just don't think you know anything you can know anything about another pilot before
[02:29:36] the first turn and if you don't know that then you can't say that a MIG 17 will win every time
[02:29:42] that needed saying the best I can recall major Boyd didn't really engage you replied by restating
[02:29:50] his claim thank you for that view lieutenant but you can't fight a MIG in an F4 will lose wars that way
[02:29:57] we would see about that John Boyd was an intelligent patriotic and good at a great many things
[02:30:02] from this exchange we concluded that one of them was deriving big ideas that aspired to university
[02:30:09] but did not reckon with the human heart an aerial combat technical factors were important
[02:30:16] some of them could be modeled but no model could tell the whole story major Boyd was not wrong his
[02:30:22] theory was simply incomplete he also completely misjudged the F4 there were no slouches at science
[02:30:29] either we were no slouches at science either with cobra ruffleson's technical acuity and hard work
[02:30:37] we had fused hard data with equally hard experience it ended up showing exactly how a
[02:30:44] fandom could smoke a MIG almost every time the energy maneuverability theory had little to say about
[02:30:51] tactics or the people who made them work the pilot is a key part of the equation though it as a
[02:30:56] though as a variable it cannot be quantified out of mirror maras students and instructors bent the
[02:31:01] jet and flew beyond the limits we were trying to turn the man in the cockpit into a weapon
[02:31:06] as adversary pilots melski co-branash and i were enjoying the role flying debriefing the
[02:31:12] adjusting from the enemy point of view day after day flight after flight we were helping our
[02:31:17] students meet the challenge we were making them part of the equation and i got to say one last
[02:31:26] thing adherence to strict rules and restrictions meant almost certain defeat against well-trained
[02:31:31] pilots fighting under no such restrictions and this is why we at top gun never existed before we
[02:31:39] we at top gun we say top gun never existed before the navy set it up at Miramar no schoolhouse that
[02:31:45] required adherence to fixed ideas reduced airplanes to numbers or considered its instructors as
[02:31:51] priests could ever be top gun in our book from the final tallies over in Vietnam we would eventually
[02:31:59] learn to tell the tale you know what we ended up from the day top gun it started in the first class
[02:32:10] graduated to the end of the Vietnam war kill ratio went from 2 to 1 to 24 to 1 it works
[02:32:20] since the key elements you age is no criteria for knowledge the young ones are as good
[02:32:31] if not better because the energy level 8 possess if they're willing to study and learn
[02:32:38] the young ones are the reason you know i look at this youngster here it's hard to believe you've been
[02:32:45] that that route but and look as young as you do but we broke with tradition the only reason
[02:32:56] he Air Force until after top gun got up and going they had Air Force fighter weapons school
[02:33:04] it knows for years gunnery and a few things but never in any like top gun now they have a red flag
[02:33:13] and the reason was the three star that they had run and things during Vietnam retired
[02:33:22] one guy held them back he mandated the flying wings thing spent time with robin holes
[02:33:32] you know the great general there's a guy i is a guy i lies talked to the links with robin holes
[02:33:41] and football games with them and and brought him down to fly with a smear mark on the Friday
[02:33:49] had a super happy hour that night with him and and uh and uh i watch his career in
[02:33:58] because of the mandated things the Air Force wouldn't change we never criticized them we didn't do anything
[02:34:07] they had a well i learned a lot about them at the dream land when we were flying a dream
[02:34:15] land with the Air Force guys there were four or five guys up there we've good it's anybody i
[02:34:20] had but they were under the restriction of of an old timer old timer probably out of Washington
[02:34:29] who would come out and when he retired the Air Force jumped on red flag and they are good now let me
[02:34:37] tie it there is good as anybody so you know as you were just kind of alluding to we get into
[02:34:47] what you title in the book proof of concept which is the guys are going to war and uh you you say
[02:34:57] here top gun students became crisp smart quick deadly and confident they knew the performance
[02:35:04] envelopes of their airplanes and missiles maneuver quickly to exploit them and handled
[02:35:09] all the switch interfaces in the cockpit efficiently they demonstrated their ability to fly the
[02:35:14] egg tactics to perfection and use the high yo yo out of a two plane loose douce formation
[02:35:22] to fill a and fry a grass or pilots almost every time out their final exam was a special
[02:35:28] retreat and unrestricted sparrow inside wind or shoot against live maneuvering targets
[02:35:37] that was Steve Smith we took him up to the civic missile range and took a BQM 34
[02:35:45] which you know the good old American way would straighten leveled like shooting down an airline
[02:35:51] or and we found out that this damn BQM would out gee the airplanes particularly when it's
[02:35:59] controlled on the ground so I put Steve Smith one of my originals put him down on the ground
[02:36:07] controlling and that damn missile come out and then dogfight him and Jerry Boo yeah the first
[02:36:15] first student grad shot it down first time out give us a little history on the patch the top gun patch
[02:36:27] I don't you know we we could take every night before and after we started working students
[02:36:37] at the club we just go and sometimes have beer to and I could take today's effort so the
[02:36:47] the the patch was designed at the old club by two of the guys Steve Smith could do anything
[02:36:56] I mean these guys are we should see where they are today in business but Steve and in millholzed
[02:37:04] signed a patch and we submitted it incidentally I never asked for permission ever in a front end
[02:37:15] of what we were doing no permission no letters of approval everything you know if we if they don't
[02:37:24] like the telltale's never had to get anything ask above me and it was it wasn't me it was nine of us
[02:37:35] the key elements what I talked about each guy bringing something special table there would not
[02:37:41] she didn't like this but I do there would not have been a top gun had any of the nine guys not
[02:37:49] been available now maybe I don't know what you what your religion is or what you believe
[02:37:57] but millon I and a few of the guys sit down to our day and realize this and how we all got it together
[02:38:05] how all nine of us ended up in a group pretty much has to do with some higher power help yeah
[02:38:13] higher rank in and it worked and being young you know you could always say me a couple of
[02:38:20] then I don't know that he did nobody ever got us go ahead yeah that's that's uh and that the fact
[02:38:30] that the top gun patches are made in the sights yeah it's sort of kind of offensive right to
[02:38:38] if you're if you're a fifth year a Russian and it was and to make 21 and some many
[02:38:44] Washington said when we submitted it the guys were wearing her on the fleets Steve had a
[02:38:51] maid somewhere in the PI and made him for us quick so we're all wearing these patches you know
[02:38:58] top gun man mood like that and some many Washington called out and said we're gonna have a
[02:39:06] sponsored state department and I called my I call my bulletproof jacket who's a three star
[02:39:15] animal at airpack bush brungle nice and move bush brungle and when I took the job
[02:39:23] this is kind of off the record I took the job I talked to him because I'd work for him and
[02:39:28] I liked him and he liked me and I just said kind of man you talk about loading the thing up in
[02:39:37] the hurry and he said I'll make it bulletproof at a great career I got promoted commander early
[02:39:46] made captain two years early and you know I would end up in shit you know the only reason
[02:39:54] I'd get torpedoed along the way was bringle bringle was tough boy general quiet all man
[02:40:04] but night he predicted me in the patch he made one phone call and oh we like our patch
[02:40:13] so there's your answer you know one thing I want to jump through real quick as you mentioned
[02:40:18] a couple times the the fault the traits that you guys were you know putting forward as what a good
[02:40:26] pilot consists of you say a passion for the mission necessary to sustain the individual in
[02:40:32] an extreme environment leadership by personal example a compassionate inspirational person
[02:40:38] willing to take responsibility extraordinary airmanship required to operate in so unforgiving
[02:40:45] and environment humility derived from a sense of being part of something much greater than one
[02:40:51] self subject matter expertise that is beyond reproach a work ethic that will drive the person to do
[02:41:00] whatever it takes for however long it takes to ensure success personal discipline to endure
[02:41:08] the rigorous training and attention to detail required to constantly perform at an optimum level
[02:41:14] integrity adaptability innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo
[02:41:21] and last credibility established through demonstrated performance sustained over time
[02:41:29] now the only thing I don't like about those is it took me I think four or five books that I've written
[02:41:35] that are thousands of words each to to explain what you just did a few it a few sentences it took
[02:41:41] me it took me three years with the help of two other guys to define and we were we were
[02:41:53] in a long time ago those were written we never put them in a legacy book document like this
[02:42:02] for the 15th anniversary but it took a three years to find and the reason being is top gun
[02:42:09] with so successful after the first half dozen classes we weren't going to get torpedoed anywhere
[02:42:18] there were guys begging to get in and we had to have selection criteria and you got one of them
[02:42:26] and they still use those criteria in the selection and the instructors I'm not sure the guys
[02:42:34] know what they're getting into because the work load is crazy how hard they were from now
[02:42:43] well obviously it's a high standard and there's a reason for it like you said earlier
[02:42:47] you got people's lives in your hands that's right and you're right and besides that right now
[02:42:56] and I don't know how you feel David but they're still even in the beginning they were the best
[02:43:05] the best and they kept that alive for 50 years that's why the book was written it's celebrating
[02:43:14] the legacy and putting it running and then like this 50 years of trying to live by those criteria
[02:43:25] in a selection because like this and it's worked and they're proud of it
[02:43:31] 42 CEOs and about 600 instructors small group and at time 50 years go ahead please
[02:43:47] again this we're getting into a section now that's that's talking about the proof of concept
[02:43:53] because now the guys are at war as I was saying and we get to here on Saturday March 28th
[02:43:59] Jerry and his Rios Steve Barkley were idling their F4J standing on the catapult in a
[02:44:06] alert five status ready for quick launch when the radar control ship reported four bandits
[02:44:11] inbound toward the carrier that afternoon bollier and his air wing commander Paul Spear were launched
[02:44:16] off the constellations deck as the radar calls kept coming and the range closed they saw no
[02:44:22] sign of the mix the fanom pair pressed ahead it was bullier who first sighted the enemy fighters
[02:44:27] ahead and above him at about 25,000 feet following the loose doos doctrine Jerry alerted spear
[02:44:34] and took lead stoking his afterburners and accelerating into a climbing turn to intercept the two
[02:44:41] mixed spotted the Americans and separated the leader climbing and his wingman Blake breaking into a
[02:44:46] right turn bollier took the enemy wingman while Spear went after the leader as he closed with the
[02:44:54] number two mid bollier realized I suspect in the space of those first 20 seconds that his excitement
[02:45:00] had led him to stray from the proper technique he was fighting in the horizontal and climbing
[02:45:04] to engage his enemy directly he had lost too much airspeed to attack effectively he dove again
[02:45:10] to regain it pulling seven gs at the bottom he found the mid descending with him looking to avoid
[02:45:15] a turning fight he returned to what we had taught him he pulled up sharply sharply to initiate
[02:45:21] the egg maneuver rocketing vertically the mig had no chance to keep up meanwhile down below
[02:45:27] commander Spear had seemed to unnerve his own mig its pilot turned wide and left the fight
[02:45:34] Spear was turning back toward bollier to clear Jerry's tail when Jerry when Jerry's mig saw Spear
[02:45:41] the north Vietnamese pilot fired a heat seeking a toll missile at the approaching phantom
[02:45:48] the head shot the head on shot missed up and up bulliers phantom went with real
[02:45:53] barcly keeping him oriented telling him that the mig shooting at Spear was no threat Jerry
[02:45:58] focused on setting up his shot arcing over the top he saw that their opponent was vulnerable
[02:46:03] the mig had lost sight of him the enemy pilot banked right and then reversed sharply left
[02:46:08] as if looking for his pursuer this last maneuver was a fatal mistake it gave Jerry a clean shot
[02:46:15] up the enemy's tailpipe with the tone of a sidewinder lock buzzing in his helmet earphones
[02:46:21] he pressed the trigger and his missile left the rail it tracked true and exploded underneath the
[02:46:27] mig a shower of steel fragments sliced into the enemy plane and set it on fire trailing flames
[02:46:34] like a torch the mig sailed along rocking its wings bollier pulled up sharply to avoid running
[02:46:40] past him slid in behind him again and fired another missile this one finished him just like he had
[02:46:46] done in the drone shoot at top gun back on the deck of the constellation the celebration started
[02:46:52] immediately Paul Spear a large man gave diminutive Jerry a bear hug and lifted him off the top
[02:46:59] of his feet champagne strictly forbidden floed later that day a hanoi radio broadcast from the
[02:47:05] mig locked uh confirmed the mig loss in Washington the politics of peace talks forced the
[02:47:11] Pentagon to make smoke other than a brief announcement of a mig being downed the kill was said to have
[02:47:17] been scored by fanombs that were escorting a photo reconnaissance aircraft the navy kept a lid
[02:47:22] on the story back at Miramar we wondered who the mig killer was when it was finally confirmed that
[02:47:28] the mig killers were bowlier and barcly we were ecstatic it validated not only what we talk
[02:47:35] what not only what we taught but our schools very existence pretty awesome did you guys
[02:47:46] have any beverages when you found out that oh yeah yeah there's a lot of work getting to that
[02:47:59] point and there are a lot of people you have no idea juggle what the opposition was like but it was
[02:48:07] the same we're young we're doing the best we can that's waiting to see and man when the when the kill
[02:48:16] started happening the word started we went from having to work hard to get people to come to the
[02:48:26] school like we did before we initiated to where Steve Smith had loved same guys he'd say I'm sorry
[02:48:38] were full up for six months but I'll put you in the waiting list for next year he's ghost
[02:48:47] he's ghost guys you know they're too close to Washington they gave us a fit in the beginning
[02:48:53] fast forward in January 1972 captain Smith cut the order top gun became a permanent
[02:49:01] detachment appearing in the rag organizational chart with a solid line instead of a dotted line
[02:49:07] connecting it to chicksmith's headquarters that little tweak to the org chart made all the
[02:49:12] different suddenly we were assured of adequate staffing equipment fuel and operating funds
[02:49:17] our program is free of its former parent organization and then it goes top gun goes to war
[02:49:31] yanky station 1972 on March 30th 30,000 north Vietnamese army soldiers supported by a hundred tanks
[02:49:38] acquired from red china invaded south Vietnam a few days later another 20,000 troops also supported
[02:49:43] by tanks struck south Vietnam from louse they were the vanguard of a communist army that would
[02:49:49] ultimately field 300,000 troops and 600 armored vehicles on May 10th
[02:49:56] present Nixon ordered the mining of high fong harbor and other Japanese or another north Vietnamese
[02:50:01] ports putting a stop to Soviet deliveries of migs and surface to air missiles meanwhile air force
[02:50:07] Marine Corps navy planes hammered north Vietnamese supply lines bridges collapsed under a
[02:50:12] barrage of first generation smart weapons including laser guided bombs delivered by navy
[02:50:17] grum and a six intruders in a seven course air twos air force b 52 strato forces strato fortresses
[02:50:25] struck mega airfields around hanoi the enemy tried to defend these important targets
[02:50:30] flying make 21 and make 19 interceptors the north Vietnamese pilots found themselves in wild
[02:50:35] dog fights with US air force fanom's on May 10th 3,000,000,000,000 went down to air to air missiles
[02:50:41] but the north Vietnamese pilots scored two kills the air force continued to use old style
[02:50:48] world war two air tactics that we found so limiting the navy was on a different path
[02:50:54] the north Vietnamese makes encountered a new navy the alpha strikes included electronic countermeasure
[02:51:00] aircraft that jam the radio frequencies of the north Vietnamese pilots they ran into top gun trained
[02:51:06] pilots the tactics we developed at Miramar changed the game altogether and look this there's a
[02:51:17] section of the book that i'm not going to read right now because people just need to get the
[02:51:21] book and read it but you go into some of these incredible dog fights the tactics are being used
[02:51:26] they're being executed and victory after victory is being chalked up and you get to hear by mid-June
[02:51:35] the navy's kill ratio during linebacker stood at almost 12 to one a 600% increase over what
[02:51:42] we had managed during rolling thunder the navy's high command was ecstatic the north Vietnamese
[02:51:47] air force was clearly demoralized that spring a make 17 pilot encountered a navy f4 and ejected
[02:51:53] on the spot before he even came under fire they had no answer for our new tactics and teamwork
[02:51:59] by the summer of 1972 the migs focused on attacking the air force while avoiding U.S. flights
[02:52:06] originating from Yankee station are mig hungry top gun grads didn't like it but the tactical
[02:52:11] switch provided stark testimony to which service they thought they could score against sadly the
[02:52:17] air force fought the 1972 air campaign essentially as it had rolling thunder and here in
[02:52:24] into the fluid for formation cost them air crews of the 51 aircraft that the air force lost during
[02:52:31] operation linebacker 22 went down to guns and missiles of north Vietnamese migs during the same time
[02:52:38] the navy lost just four birds to migs the Marines lost an f4 phantom to a mig and scored one in return
[02:52:45] from the start date of the top gun program to the end of the war the navy's overall kill ratio
[02:52:50] was 24 to 1 i mean that's just transformational transformational efforts on your part the rest
[02:53:05] of the top gun team the navy captain all for putting that report together the chain of command
[02:53:12] for actually listening and enacting these things it's a incredible history it was a good start
[02:53:21] and the big thing is the book represents 50 years we wanted in writing never been written before
[02:53:32] wanted in writing the legacy of how it got started and where really it's powerful it's a
[02:53:41] problem or other volumes that could be written from this goes out into the 70s 85 probably the last
[02:53:54] in this book you guys digs red butter all these guys over 50 years they were in the
[02:54:05] they were in the opposition and they fought their way through it we gave all their planes
[02:54:15] amongst mcun who was the co number four and it up giving me his rallies all they have a
[02:54:21] carrier plates during one of their when their fiasco's over in his room all their planes were
[02:54:29] given away and they they stole some newer plates he cut their hands on some it's never been
[02:54:39] and the only downside was the mood to fall in at the time wasn't very well received i mean
[02:54:47] you imagine on your home in beautiful sandier having your kids go to school here
[02:54:53] taking your college graduate wives and say let's unload it all we're going up to the moon to live
[02:55:02] and i'm just a god it's really a sad story they get up there and they found some some
[02:55:11] some bad things up there and and then the other thing was the opposition within the navy and i'm
[02:55:19] speaking personally now was all has always been apparent by that it used to be fighter pilots
[02:55:28] and attack pilots and attack pilots after the movie came out after Tom Cruise first movie
[02:55:35] shit boy they were all over it's they didn't like that one bit and the guys guys fought their way
[02:55:43] through it 42 seals in order anyhow that's another well obviously got more books in yeah
[02:55:55] got a lot more books i got one got one work
[02:56:02] meanwhile this is an over yet you know you you say here home with my family for a rare Friday night
[02:56:11] this is 1973 hours barbeque mistakes thinking about taking an after dinner swim with the kids
[02:56:15] when the phone rang i went to pick it up sensing something was wrong as it turned out i was right
[02:56:20] the executive officer of fighter squadron 143 the pukenedogs was missing an action in south
[02:56:25] Vietnam that pilot hardly haul was a friend of mine the squadron was in a state of shock
[02:56:31] it also needed a new exo which accounted for my emergency orders to pack up within 20 hours and
[02:56:37] begin the long journey out to the enterprise you've been there you guys have seen that i'm sure
[02:56:47] yeah i mean uh the it's what we sign up for but it doesn't make it easy it's harder and the family
[02:56:55] anybody you know you show up 24 hours later a navy sea two took me aboard at
[02:57:06] qb point foome out to the carrier the squadron seal gordon cornell met me on the flight deck gordo
[02:57:11] was a warrior's warrior a man who'd flown everything from f9 f panthers to f eight crusaders
[02:57:17] and f four phanams wounded an action over north Vietnam in 1966 he went on to earn two distinguished
[02:57:23] flying crosses and seventeen air metals really got glad to see you yank sorry it had to be
[02:57:28] under such terrible circumstances i shook his hand and asked how the dogs were doing their dogs
[02:57:34] down they'll always be okay their tough bunch bonded as Harley would have wanted still clutching
[02:57:41] my hand he seemed to reconsider this he added their herding badly some of the guys can't wait to get home
[02:57:49] and help out Mary Lou and the kids there was sadness in his eyes the shooting war was over
[02:57:55] but we all had wounds to heal as twenty minutes before the armances became effective
[02:58:02] the whole the an armor
[02:58:12] every fighter pilot wants a command of his own squadron i learned i was to become the
[02:58:16] skipper of the pukendogs again i'm fast boarding at at this point at i'm gonna jump to a part
[02:58:22] where you're heading to Las Vegas at the end of August for an enormous reunion of american
[02:58:29] aviators of all services who had phoned in Vietnam we would unofficially welcome back the 166 men
[02:58:34] taken prisoner by the north Vietnamese some three thousand of us and our wives gathered at the
[02:58:39] hilton there were many spontaneous many reunions that night as old friend saw each other for the first
[02:58:44] time and years the happiness touched everyone the war over the years of hardship and rear view mirror
[02:58:50] at last our former POWs were ready to pick up their lives and careers what an enormous challenge
[02:58:56] some came home knowing nothing of the summer of love the wats riots the ken state shootings
[02:59:01] or the assassinations of martin Luther King and robbered fkennity the last experience of america
[02:59:06] predated acid rock and woodstock fitting into the here and now and getting to know their
[02:59:12] families again tested the former POWs all over again and you and i were talking about Charlie

[03:03:15] awesome that's leadership yeah that's leadership on the vice at most part indeed yeah that's
[03:03:23] awesome i was laughing this is a laughable comment but i got to say you know we have back in the
[03:03:33] day in the sealed teams we would deploy with our maritime equipment some of that maritime equipment
[03:03:40] is 55 horsepower engines and we were in our couple tunes we were deploying on a ship and when i was
[03:03:50] reading what you were writing about the aircraft you got their own personalities and you what you
[03:03:55] and the exact same thing happened we came home from one deployment and they said hey we're going to
[03:03:59] take in your old ones we're going to take your old engines we're going to send him in for maintenance
[03:04:02] you were giving you guys some new ones and my my first lieutenant rep who was in charge of the
[03:04:07] engines the guy named z the zulu cap we used to call him he says well i'm not giving him up and he
[03:04:14] had names for all the engines you we had one called frank and started one called big cat they
[03:04:18] they all had names and he knew him he knew him and rather than get brand new engines he said no
[03:04:24] i want these engines i want the same engines and the caveatie golf just like okay you want these
[03:04:31] old engines he said yes i do these are the ones that work these are the ones that i know
[03:04:36] the devil's the devil you know is better than the one you don't know right hey my the airplane
[03:04:42] tell us a little bit about uh gunner king oh god bob bob king warner officer gunner
[03:04:51] had been with i first heard about him with the seals the seals many years ago and
[03:05:06] they said the fighter scorn and they said we're going to send you a we're going to send you a
[03:05:13] warner officer seal he's going to be your air gunner and i think what was that mean was an air gunner
[03:05:20] he knew everything to do with a warner and some missiles on the air plane and uh and he
[03:05:28] held a new it all stand on his head he was that good but big talk good looking guy personality
[03:05:37] crazy everybody in this squad and loved him and one night and could be a could be point at the
[03:05:43] oh cup i got him only time i ever got him tell me any seal stories you know we have the air
[03:05:50] deals all wonder about you guys you know we really depressed and everything and i got gunner
[03:05:58] talking to me and i said gunner how did you end up here and he said i was
[03:06:05] inserted in northean um and uh i think the guy with him was killed and there were two of
[03:06:15] men there and they were going to put it i think they had a mission to take care of something in there
[03:06:22] nicely said okay and he said i lost my partner and i got in a river and i'm floating out
[03:06:33] floating out the river ran to the ocean and he said i was floating down this river with
[03:06:44] looking for him along the banks in the air and there and people yelling and he said the only thing
[03:06:51] i'm gonna tell you is he says i felt this warm thing wrap around me you know what it was
[03:06:59] some guy named big sea snake wrapped around him you guys you know what that's like i read about them
[03:07:07] and he said he took out he took out his knife and he got the snake said oh and he said i
[03:07:20] floated out and he said but he said when i when i got out they picked me up he said
[03:07:27] i never could quit dreaming about that day i'm gonna snake and so anyhow i said he said well
[03:07:37] he said didn't want me back and Vietnam anymore they wanted to give my rest i think
[03:07:43] yeah after a lot of things yeah after Vietnam there's a whole group of seals when they
[03:07:49] downside this downside is the seal teams there was a whole group of seals that they sent to the
[03:07:55] fleet and also it might have been because he was a warnafter because i don't know if they knew
[03:07:59] what to do with the warnafters back then in the inside the seal teams and they might have said oh you
[03:08:04] made a warnafter congratulations you're gonna go be a warnafter in the fleet could have been
[03:08:09] either one of those things uh if any of your listeners should know the worry about the warnafter
[03:08:15] bobcane no calling bobby and uh he was remarkable in his capacity as my gunner for two
[03:08:25] cruises and uh wrote to him for a couple years and lots of tight cuddling i think in pomey maybe
[03:08:33] still alive but i just love it if somebody you hold them and let you know so you could tell me
[03:08:40] certainly if somebody knows and there's a lot of guys that listen to this so they'll get the word out
[03:08:45] and try and find uh warnafter bobby king find out where he's at yeah the um you you go into a great
[03:09:03] kind of detailed account of of the Israeli war and how you know you you already mentioned how
[03:09:12] uh how we were able to help out how top gun specifically was able to help out and and also the efforts
[03:09:21] of of the guys and the Israeli you know air force is that what is the Israeli air force?
[03:09:26] oh yeah those two gentlemen that i speak of in the book both went on to be
[03:09:34] commanding generalcy is really air force one of them went on to be the secretary of events in Israel
[03:09:40] and i can't tell you everything i've done with them but uh they are remarkable and you know for years
[03:09:48] i think we'd uh started out maybe living in their shadow a little bit whether tactically
[03:09:55] were as good once top gun came out then we're equal and uh but uh when they come in the United
[03:10:06] States on business i'd get a phone call totally illegally get a phone call it's a Daniel
[03:10:15] and he ton he said i'm in Washington if i come out can i fly with you come on so i fly with him in
[03:10:25] the good story is i got my squadron or airway i can't remember but he calls me and he flies into
[03:10:34] you how he got to you man oh but he she ends up in you man and he said you put me on the
[03:10:41] flights against the model yeah yeah so daylight we rolled on the runway two a wingman i got
[03:10:50] a wingman with me and he's got the second section we break the ground he'll have to turn out to go
[03:10:56] over to the range and he's you gotta hear the sky near he's so cool he said Daniel i said the
[03:11:07] out three he said i got a fire and i said is it bad no it's not bad he said i just shut the engine down
[03:11:19] he unloads fuel all over the range makes one perfect turn around lands rolls all around the runway
[03:11:29] and uh by the time the fire truck's got to him he jumped on the first little tractor that was there
[03:11:39] nobody ever knew he was with a pilot was a guy who played that's just a smooth mother
[03:11:47] and boy could he fly got done the pretty good pretty good and uh we did get top gun at one time with
[03:11:57] mug's muckoo and gave my wire planes in order for their survival and that war
[03:12:06] i promise to take Bethlehem to Israel here as soon as we get rid of this lovely
[03:12:12] nightmare in right now guys go for one two long go and back to the book 40 miles off south
[03:12:23] Vietnam April 29th 1975 for naval aviation the problem of Vietnam never seemed to go away
[03:12:31] Lieutenant Darrell Condor Gary stood before the assembled pilots and reels of VF51 in
[03:12:37] Darrell's short career he'd been thrown into the air war over North Vietnam before completing his
[03:12:43] rag training back in the late 1960s as an F4 backseater two tours there and he came home in time
[03:12:49] for me to pull him into top gun as one of our instructors he subsequently went back to flight
[03:12:54] school became an F4 pilot and went through top gun as a student before heading out to the
[03:12:59] carrier USS coral sea and his first overseas deployment as a fighter pilot in 1975
[03:13:04] he was a young lieutenant tasked with delivering one of the most painful briefs the squadron would ever
[03:13:10] receive it fell to Condor to bring them the news that we were abandoning our allies once and for all
[03:13:23] that's the only time I've ever seen him said I would say keg they are erwin commander about this
[03:13:31] guy do it actually when in flu cover over the healing copters and healing copters and
[03:13:42] watch the accident people going out both loads of people trying to get on the carriers and he came
[03:13:48] back and he just he couldn't he just so upset him there's a print of a man you know a lot of times
[03:13:58] I read books while in fact I only read books from people's first persons account of war
[03:14:06] because you know you I want people to understand what it's like to be there
[03:14:12] and one thing that you do in this book that you do very well is the way you connect the guys that are
[03:14:18] there with the overall picture and that's exactly what you did right here because so you've got
[03:14:25] Condor briefing the guys that we're leaving and then you go into this with the last flight to the midway
[03:14:31] from the embassy grounds 1,373 Americans in 5,595 Vietnamese were helicoptered to the naval task force
[03:14:40] another 65,000 fled by boat later to be picked up by one of the 40 ships offshore
[03:14:46] the fixed wing air crowd air lift from Tansong nut pulled out another 50,493 including almost
[03:14:56] 2700 orphans they were the lucky ones in the immediate aftermath of South Vietnam's collapse
[03:15:04] more than 150,000 civilians vanished most either executed outright or thrown into concentration camps
[03:15:12] Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City a memorial to the unknown masses of dead somewhere between
[03:15:19] one and four million Vietnamese perished from 1955 to 1975 in Cambodia another 300,000 were killed
[03:15:27] Louseloss between 20 and 60,000 in the years ahead the killing would continue as communist and
[03:15:33] surgeons toppled the governments of Louseloss in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 the
[03:15:39] Commir Rouge a regime that swept to power in the wake of America's exit from the region
[03:15:44] murdered or starve to death about 2.5 million people out of a population of 8 million
[03:15:51] more than 30% of the entire nation when Americans look back at Vietnam we remember the domestic
[03:15:57] unrest we think two of the 58,000 names memorialized on that long black marble wall in Washington
[03:16:05] those are important to remember but few want to discuss the other consequences of America's lost war
[03:16:22] You know there's a lot of connections with a lot of different things and I've been recently talking to a guy
[03:16:29] who's connected to some people that were on this operation when the ship that named the
[03:16:40] My Guest how do you say it? My Guest. The My Guest was captured by the Cambonians and I'm looking
[03:16:49] to get one of these Marines on the podcast to kind of recount what happened so it was very interesting
[03:16:56] to me when I read that you were involved in this so the Cambodians had seized an American flagged
[03:17:03] and owned cargo container ship now the ship was in Camilla Rouge hands and I'm jumping through
[03:17:09] just to hit some of these highlights on the afternoon of the 14th president Gerald Ford ordered
[03:17:13] the seventh Air Force to execute a helicopter assault on Coteang Island and the My Guest
[03:17:19] The forces landing on the island were to find the crew if there were any while another team helicopter
[03:17:26] onto the My Guest and steamed it out in the international waters just before the rescue and in
[03:17:30] Admiral Cougan received a direct call from President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
[03:17:36] I was with him in the coral seas flag headquarters and listened with great interest.
[03:17:40] President Ford ordered the carrier to strike targets on Cambodian mainland including port facilities
[03:17:46] and a nearby naval base, Naval Base. Admiral the president said go get our ship and crew back
[03:17:53] it's your show. Use all available means but no nooks. I wondered how many times our commanders
[03:18:01] on Yankee Station the dirt such a command not even Nixon ever expressed such a clear and
[03:18:07] explicit willingness to let us fight. And so you you know I skipped through this part but you
[03:18:14] were actually there to take over this this squadron. No airway. Airway and the guy that was running
[03:18:22] it said you're gonna have to wait a little bit to listen over. Nobody passes up good combat.
[03:18:28] Excuse me that's portoy support. Yeah. Leadership. Right. Right. The CIA believe that
[03:18:37] content, co-ting was lightly defended if at all in fact more than a hundred commirus troops held
[03:18:44] the island to deter their communist brothers from North Vietnam who had laid claim to these patches
[03:18:49] off the Indo Chinese coast. Armourines rolled into hot landing zones, laced with machine gun
[03:18:57] and rocket propelled grenade fire. From the ship, Darrell watched a several CH53 heavy transport
[03:19:03] helicopters took hits one crashed offshore after receiving two RGB RG RPG hits. The survivors
[03:19:09] were in the water for hours until a gig from one of our escorts pulled them to safety. Including
[03:19:14] those survivors was the Marine Forward Air Controller who somehow found an Air Force survival
[03:19:18] radio that he used to call targets for the eight seven course airs overhead, clinging to records.
[03:19:23] The radio's battery slowly failing. He gave everything he had to try and secure help for the
[03:19:27] embattled Marines pinned down in the landing zone. Three CH53 Jolly Green Giants went down during
[03:19:33] the rescue operation. Fifteen Marines were killed on Co-Tang and 50 more wounded during the fire
[03:19:39] the fighting that rage throughout the day. Meanwhile our attacker crafts saturated the myugas
[03:19:45] with tear gas and American warship racing to the anchorage with a company of Marines aboard
[03:19:49] an hour later the assault after an hour after the assault in the island began the Marines
[03:19:54] clad and gas masks swarmed the cargo of the ship and founded abandoned. We had our ship back but
[03:19:59] where was the crew. The comir had released them sending them back out to see who are navy patrol
[03:20:04] planes spotted them. Another American warship steam to the vessel pulled the crew aboard just
[03:20:09] before the lunch hour. The final act played out through the afternoon as the Air Force tried to
[03:20:14] extract the Marines from the landing zones. Heavy fire repeatedly drove them off and one battle
[03:20:19] damage Jolly Green Giants forced landed on the coral seas deck. Our maintainers swiftly
[03:20:26] patched it up a few hours later went back in action the fighting raged and our frustration level
[03:20:31] grew. The birds kept taking hits and the Marines were reporting heavy casualties by dinner and air
[03:20:37] fear force brought an AC 130 gunship and 5C 130's carrying 15,000 pound bombs known as
[03:20:43] Blue 82's nicknamed Daisy Cutters. They were the biggest, most destructive conventional weapons in
[03:20:50] the American arsenal. The first one detonated is Darrell noters watched from our deck Darrell saw
[03:20:55] the enormous explosion followed by a shockwave. The blast unleashed. It was obscured by the island.
[03:21:02] It obscured the island and swept right across the coral sea causing the huge carrier to shutter
[03:21:06] from its impact. As darkness fell another Jolly Green staggered out of the moon list night.
[03:21:12] The massive helicopter carried a crew of five and managed to pull aboard 34 Marines before
[03:21:17] suffering engine travel. The crew set down on the carriers deck and when it's ramp dropped almost
[03:21:22] three dozen wounded Marines tumbleed out onto the flight deck. The 15 Marines killed on
[03:21:28] Coteang Island became the final men whose names were etched into the wall and washington a decade later.
[03:21:35] Three more Marines declared missing an action on the island were captured by the Cameroos
[03:21:40] and later beaten to death. After we took our wounded Marines to Subic Bay we steamed south
[03:21:49] the birth for a 10 day port call. The Aussies welcomed us with great hospitality. We were treated
[03:21:54] like family everywhere we went. The crew drank and laughed with our friends from down under and put
[03:21:59] the scars of the war in our rearview mirrors. By the end of it I was so exhausted from all the
[03:22:05] free drinks and parties that I crawled into my bunk and slept the sleep of a free man. The world
[03:22:10] was at peace for the first time in 10 years. Roughly to close it out. Roughly to close out the war.
[03:22:27] Never never let a men's sirt Marines unless a Marine helicopter sets a number one less
[03:22:36] than we learned or that those were Air Force, Dally Green, Saur, Air Point but they never had
[03:22:44] inserted and they weren't ready and we heard that Air Force general he heard that operation.
[03:22:53] I got to fly. I took 12 or maybe 16 I can remember but I went downtown.
[03:23:09] The capital city. I went downtown. The 500 knots at 500 feet. Right to the downtown
[03:23:19] shock and I was looking for a sea of any makes came out or whether there were makes there.
[03:23:27] But when it was over we were just glad. The the corpsmen and the doctors on the carrier did
[03:23:36] surgery on those 30 Marines and everyone on the loose. It was awesome.
[03:23:41] Yeah. But the big lesson in that is we had a president who said, I don't know if you're
[03:23:52] sure. Don't use nukes but anything else goes. Yeah. And he did. That's decentralized command.
[03:23:59] That's how it's let the frontline leaders make the decisions to win. That's the key.
[03:24:06] Decision to win until your people will let them do it. They know how.
[03:24:18] This section here is about the Tomcat. The F-14 Tomcat almost never made it into the world.
[03:24:26] Thanks to Secretary Defense Robert S. McNamara who loved to think he knew people's business
[03:24:31] better than they did. In 1968 he tried to force the Navy to adopt the whole King F-111 fighter
[03:24:38] bomber for use on aircraft carriers. Imagine Sec Deft's Shagrin. When a mere three-star
[03:24:45] admiral, the head of Naval Aviation at the Pentagon decided to stand in his way.
[03:24:51] That truth telling sailor Tom Connelly testified to Congress. Quote, there isn't enough
[03:24:57] thrust and Christian to make that airplane into a fighter and quote. And he won. The Navy avoided
[03:25:03] being settled with the flying etsl so named by its unhappy air force pilots because of its
[03:25:09] because it's chief advocate, Secretary McNamara had been president of Ford Motor Company.
[03:25:15] McNamara took his revenge denying Vice Admiral Connelly a deserved promotion to a fourth star.
[03:25:21] But the last word belonged to the Navy. It paid tribute to the great man by naming its new
[03:25:26] world-beating fighter aircraft after him. The legendary Tom Cat was born. Though it fell
[03:25:33] right in line with other grum and felines in history, Wildcat Hellcat Bearcat and Tiger Cat,
[03:25:38] the name was the Artful Final Act in a Pentagon dogfight. That is totally legit.
[03:25:49] The crazy thing is, you know, this is this is McNamara again, you know, with the with the
[03:25:54] giant ego. Thinking he knows more than people that are actually, that are actually doing little
[03:25:59] things like landing the aircraft on aircraft carriers in the middle of the night.
[03:26:09] Fast forward a little bit. Through the post-war years, I was at sea more often than not,
[03:26:13] commanding an air wing that included four F4 Phantom Squadrons, swells attack aircraft
[03:26:18] bombers tankers early warning planes and helicopters was one of the most challenging and fun
[03:26:22] jobs I ever had. In some ways, it is also a naval aviators last to raw with the fleet.
[03:26:27] Once you get promoted out of air wing command, your flying days are limited.
[03:26:31] Until that day comes, however, air wing commanders are expected to fly every type of plane in
[03:26:35] their inventory. It was a hair-on-fire experience. In the space of a few days, I might fly an F4
[03:26:41] Phantom and A6 intruder and a helicopter. In battle, I would have been leading strikes and coordinating
[03:26:46] the attacks of my individual squadrons. The jobs a culmination of everything I had learned in
[03:26:51] naval aviators career. All the lessons, all the mentoring by other officers,
[03:26:57] comes in the way an air wing commander chooses to lead his men. Creating a culture of excellence,
[03:27:05] of openness, and of self-avaluation so that your crews can improve and grow is an essential
[03:27:13] element to success. That's something every leader should just get out their notebook and write down.
[03:27:20] Creating a culture of excellence of openness and of self-avaluation so that your crews can improve
[03:27:26] and grow isn't essential element to success. aboard the coral sea, I used the leadership
[03:27:32] techniques we developed at Top Gun to set that framework. I let my squadron commanders run their
[03:27:38] own shows without micro-managing them. That is your life's work of leadership building into that
[03:27:48] attitude and keeping that attitude that you used the top gun to lead in this other situation.
[03:27:56] Still works. If it works, why do you?
[03:28:02] 1976, I stepped out of the cockpit for one last time as a full-time aviator and said farewell to my
[03:28:07] air wing. The Navy promoted me to Captain and now as a senior officer at last. While it's still
[03:28:12] get to fly from time to time, the truth was that my days as a combat aviator were over. I suppose
[03:28:17] it would have been harder to take. Had there been nothing but desks jobs on the horizon for me.
[03:28:21] Thank God that was not the case. Ronald Wilson Reagan was my commander in chief, the prestige of
[03:28:26] naval aviation and the military generally was set for resurgence after many years and the
[03:28:31] Dolgrem's falling that would draw from Vietnam. It was a fine time for a newly minted captain
[03:28:37] to take command. I was going to see as the skipper of my own ship. Talk about a wake-up call
[03:28:49] from flying fighters at Mach 2. I found myself navigating the Pacific at 12 knots. On the bridge of
[03:28:55] a 40,000 ton, 660 foot long behemoth, crude by 22 officers in 400 men. While we had two Boeing H46C
[03:29:04] night helicopters to help run vertical replenishment missions between our ship and those we
[03:29:08] service for the first time in my career. I had virtually no connection to flying fixed wing aircraft.
[03:29:14] It was a big transition for me personally. So you took over a ship and this ship is a resupply ship.
[03:29:22] I was on board a ship. A Navy ship. So I'd probably been in the Navy for four years before I
[03:29:30] actually went on a ship for any length of time. I was on board a NLPD, an amphib, and we were out
[03:29:39] and we were doing for the first time. It was an unrep with avert rep. What do they call when they
[03:29:45] combine them together? What's it called? Is it a name for it? Same. Okay. So it's an under-way
[03:29:50] replenishment and a vertical replenishment and then there were doing two ships at the same time.
[03:29:56] One on each side. When I saw this and like I said, I'd been in the SEAL teams for four years or
[03:30:03] three years in the SEAL teams and plus you know going through SEAL training, I could not believe what
[03:30:09] I was watching. This is an insane operation. There's a ship which is the one that you drove
[03:30:15] is the ship in the middle and it's got fuel on it and it's got food on it and they pull these things
[03:30:23] along side each other. They're probably 15 yards apart. Something like that? Little more.
[03:30:31] Little more than that? 120, 140 feet. Okay. So I'm maybe I'm a little bit, you know, I'm maybe
[03:30:38] not remembering. I'll tell you what it looked like to my young eyes. It looked like we were about
[03:30:43] the crash. That's what it looked like. And these, they're going whatever seven or eight,
[03:30:48] ten knots. What's the 12 knots? You're steaming through the sea. These ships are within. What's
[03:30:54] so what is it? We're talking 30 yards apart. They're 30 yards apart from each other. Massive
[03:30:58] vessels. They're connected by a by giant hoses that are pumping oil and gas on board. So there's
[03:31:07] flammable liquid, you know, flowing through these hoses and then on top that you have helicopters
[03:31:12] that are landing and taking off, bringing gear and food from one ship to another. It's insane.
[03:31:18] That's a verd, right, man. It's a really good heel of pilots. Oh yeah. Yeah. We always, you know,
[03:31:26] you were talking about the, you know, air force helicopter pilots or, or for me, the Navy pilots
[03:31:34] were the best pilots we could get when I, when I first got in the Navy because those guys hovered
[03:31:38] at over, they hovered over these ships all the time. That's what they did for a living. So they'd
[03:31:43] come into drop us on a fast rope. They would hold station like it was a joke. They'd be like,
[03:31:47] no problem. Or sit in here. Well, stay here as well. Right where you want us as long as we can.
[03:31:52] But the purpose of you being in command of this ship is so that you can understand the logistics
[03:31:56] of the Navy and how to, oh, sure. How to drive a ship in the hopes that you can do a good enough
[03:32:01] job that they go, okay, this guy can, this guy can manage an aircraft carrier. And, and that's
[03:32:07] what they did. It's a prerequisite. Pre-requisite to get you what you wanted or, I guess, maybe the ultimate
[03:32:17] goal of someone in your shoes was to be in command of an aircraft carrier. And you got it. You got,
[03:32:25] you say this, the Ranger, which was your aircraft carrier, is my ship now, perched on the bridge,
[03:32:29] seated in a barber chair with skipper stencil on its back. I watched the bustle of the flight deck
[03:32:36] from the best seat in the house. I was 46 years old. Still wearing the Ray bands. I bought in
[03:32:40] Pensacola and the Star of David chain around my neck that was given to you by your Israeli friends.
[03:32:46] My little mouse from North Island was tucked away in the captain's cabin a few yards,
[03:32:50] after my chair. These three towels min served every day as a reminder of who I was and where I came
[03:32:56] from since I first climbed into the cockpit in Pensacola.
[03:33:00] As you start talking about, so what year is this? This is like 81, 82,
[03:33:10] on the carrier. Yeah. 80, 80, 81, 82. You start talking about the fact that there's a,
[03:33:18] there's a drug problem in the Navy. There's a number one problem in my entire
[03:33:24] time on ships. What's a drugs? And you're dealing with this. You have guys getting in trouble.
[03:33:33] You have guys trying to kill themselves. I mean, you detail this again from a leadership perspective.
[03:33:37] It's a great part of the book. And then there's something else that happens that I'm going to
[03:33:43] go into here. My ship's company suffered a terrible tragedy. A young airman named Paul.
[03:33:49] How do you say his last name? Taurus. Taurus. Taurus. Taurus. Collapsed and died while we were at
[03:33:56] Subic Bay about three weeks after we rescued some refugees which you go into.
[03:34:01] Taurus was a sad story. A 20 year old from Michigan who's time in uniform as a case study
[03:34:05] in the devastation wrought by drugs in our Navy. Having served for three years he had never been
[03:34:10] promoted. In fact, he was in frequent trouble and tried to desert twice. His squadron commander
[03:34:15] disciplined him repeatedly. He was no stranger to our correctional custody training unit or CCU.
[03:34:21] Nothing seemed to work. He remained an often belligerent hard case who frustrated his squadron
[03:34:27] commander. I never met this sailor, but his death changed my life forever. The ship had just
[03:34:32] returned from a five day visit to Hong Kong where he was an unauthorized absentee.
[03:34:38] He was next in the CCU that April of 1981. My understanding from the Navy investigation that
[03:34:45] followed his death is that combat. As always, he fought with a couple of our senior pedi officers who
[03:34:51] then took him up on the flight deck in order to start jogging. It was routine exercise in the
[03:34:57] swell-turing Subic Bay heat. Taurus had previously been restricted to bread and water as a result
[03:35:06] of his combativeness. As he was running, he collapsed. Taken below. He began to have seizures.
[03:35:11] 30 minutes later, medical personnel arrived to treat him, but sadly he died soon after. The Navy
[03:35:16] determined he had gone into cardiac arrest as a result of heat exhaustion.
[03:35:26] So this is just a horrible situation. And
[03:35:33] there's an investigation. They get done with the investigation. You get a punitive letter or non-punitive
[03:35:49] letter. So you get a letter that says, hey, this shouldn't happen because as we know, a commanding
[03:35:56] officer's responsible for everything that happens. That's key right there. Five thousand, four hundred
[03:36:04] guys, and one of them happens to be on drugs. My guys, the medical department made a couple of mistakes.
[03:36:11] The Mo1 nervous once time was unacceptable. That young fellow is disciplined. On the carrier,
[03:36:21] I let the squadron commanders run their own discipline cases. And they work a long time
[03:36:29] to become a commander of a squadron. No doubt. So I let them do it. And his squadron commander that
[03:36:37] young man was, he was a patty, too easy. A guy had been the mass about four or five times.
[03:36:47] He should have thrown his ass out of the military. But he just kept going back to his drugs.
[03:36:55] And ultimately died. And his parents were very successful people in Michigan.
[03:37:06] And then through the Washington bureaucracy, SUNY, for $8 million, maybe went through grand jury
[03:37:18] in Washington. They found, you know, I wasn't liable for anything except that you become a political
[03:37:27] liability in Washington as a senior naval officer. And that's what happened. And I don't think we
[03:37:38] need to put any of this in. I'm gonna, I've addressed it in the new book. But what happened was,
[03:37:45] I went, I got a great job out of the carrier tour. They sent me to to a sing-pack fleeing.
[03:37:52] And I got the current officer job. Which you do cover that in his book. And I'll let you out.
[03:38:00] Well, no, it's all right. It's all right. I got a phone call from CNN. Is that in there? Yeah,
[03:38:05] that's in there. Go ahead then. Well, you're gonna cover. I just want to make sure that
[03:38:10] the three of you understand that. I got a call from CNN and invited me to back to Washington.
[03:38:16] I flew back. It's been a whole morning at Moldim Watkins, a new sub-mariner. I'd worked for before.
[03:38:25] He knew me well. And he says, I just spent the whole morning drink coffee and smoke a cigarette
[03:38:33] with him. And he said, I did everything I could do. And I know it's true because I can cover a
[03:38:41] collaboration from his what he said, me said. But politically, he said, stay in the Navy.
[03:38:52] And I'll see you're so like, did I meant so like and for flying? And I looked at the who the
[03:39:01] opposition was a senator for Michigan. And you can tell it's a tough thing to talk about. And he was
[03:39:12] going to be Germany armed services committee. This senator from Michigan was going to be chairman
[03:39:18] Carl 11. And so I was never he's a one that sponsored the lawsuit on the I of the family.
[03:39:27] He controls five federal judges and I thought shit, it's over. So I went back and talked to
[03:39:37] talked to a home and talked to my wife and got out of the Navy two weeks later.
[03:39:45] And I just had a great time.
[03:39:49] Yeah, it's it's a it's a strange things for civilians may not realize this when you become when you
[03:39:54] get selected for admiral it has to be approved by a conderson and or yeah and it's like you said
[03:40:01] it's a very political thing. And I've seen it I've seen get some guys get ripped apart by it.
[03:40:06] Something will come up and people will protest and it's a political thing. And as you say here
[03:40:13] that's just how Washington worked. I resigned my staff position and retired two weeks later on March
[03:40:18] first 1983 after 29 years one month and one day in uniform. It's a it's a you know you talked
[03:40:31] earlier about how in combat you can make the right decisions you can do the right thing you can have
[03:40:37] the right plan and you can still something can still go wrong. And it's a very risky thing when you get
[03:40:46] to those high ranks in the Navy you can do the right thing you can know the right people and you can
[03:40:51] still get tripped up in that the last the last hurdle by by the smallest by something that's
[03:41:03] yeah. So transition when I returned to California that spring I felt like a refugee in my own home
[03:41:14] town. I was almost 50 years old starting over from scratch I needed to find a new sense of normal
[03:41:20] for me normal is waking up in my cabin to the smell of salt air coming through a brass port hole.
[03:41:26] It was the heavy jolt of a catapult launch the euphoria of breaking mock one in a vertical climb.
[03:41:32] It was long beautiful nights night flights across our country and the sense of purpose I felt when
[03:41:38] we saved lives it's see it was the fear of flying strikes in the north Vietnam the honor of leading
[03:41:45] top gun alongside some of the finest young man America'd ever produced it was welcoming old friends
[03:41:50] back from the Hanoi Hilton and holding membership in a brotherhood that defined my entire adult life.
[03:41:57] In civilian life it was no normal for me. I struggled. My first marriage did not survive
[03:42:03] the many deployments of the 1970s being gone so much finally drove a wedge between us that could not
[03:42:08] be removed. I married a second time while serving in surface ships. Every the optimist I guess
[03:42:13] it wasn't meant to be. I could have gone on to into the defense industry like so many other
[03:42:18] retired military offers do great salaries great benefits. I refused to do that instead I went
[03:42:23] into business for myself and Southern California. The leadership principles I learned in the navy
[03:42:28] played a large role in my success. What business did you get into? I worked in her team and
[03:42:36] in the street for a while and then I built. I couldn't build anything. She can she visualise that I
[03:42:43] could build it. We did a lot of beautiful homes and stuff like that. You know you detail the
[03:42:55] I guess I'm going to use the word. I don't know if this word's been used on this podcast before
[03:43:01] brace yourself. You detail the romantic aspect of this the way this folds unfolds in the book and
[03:43:07] it's just a beautiful story about you know Mary Beth you guys you know connect again during
[03:43:15] all this turmoil and you end up with the girl that you originally fell in love with. So again
[03:43:28] that's another aspect that you got to you got to read the book to to understand. You also go into
[03:43:37] the F-35 and what that program consists of and what the shortfalls are and what the shortfalls
[03:43:47] of the training program can be and what they have to watch out for and like you talked about
[03:43:51] early the struggles of the top-gun program and you know when you get to it you got to a point
[03:43:59] in the end of the book here where you start talking about what a winning team. If you were going
[03:44:03] to build a winning team what it would look like I'm just going to summarize some of the things you say.
[03:44:08] You say because the basic truth of fighter combat remains the same it is not the aircraft that
[03:44:13] wins a fight it's the man in the cockpit flying is a perishable skill it has to be practiced
[03:44:18] constantly and maintained on a consistent basis. My boys will all be dogfighters with enough planes
[03:44:25] in inventory we can return to the days when any pilot who's who's in good with the senior
[03:44:30] chief in maintenance control can check out a burn and go find a fight club somewhere off the coast.
[03:44:35] That's how we'll sharpen our edge and dark fog fighting again. I run through this mental exercise
[03:44:42] often. I always come back to this our top-gun maximum. What matters is the man not the machine.
[03:44:49] So let's talk about what a good fighter pilot candidate looks like over the years and thousands
[03:44:53] of aviators I've known I've noticed the best share some common traits a good pilot would have
[03:45:01] a multi a patriotic mindset and a self-starting work ethic. He should believe in something
[03:45:07] greater than himself while remaining self-reliant and confident without being overbearing.
[03:45:12] Some ego is necessary. I wouldn't want a soul filled without flying in my wing and athletic
[03:45:18] background helps because when properly coached at the right age youngsters learn trust, teamwork,
[03:45:24] and goal setting. They'll need all those things in the air. I'll pass on anybody who displays
[03:45:30] his participation trophies. Self esteem without real accomplishment will make anyone crash and burn.
[03:45:38] Give me a committed B student with a boiling will to win over an A plus scholar with a careerist
[03:45:44] agenda and will be on our way. Finally it's important to have a sincere interest in the history
[03:45:51] and lore of your calling. Good pilot strive constantly for self-improvement. In my first years
[03:45:56] in the Navy I had the opportunity to meet the World War II generation and hear their stories and
[03:46:01] lessons. I read every combat memoir I could could and glean a lot of little things from them that
[03:46:11] helped me in my journey. We lived on the edge of life and death and the margin between them was
[03:46:16] narrow. I think Jimmy do little bought me a scotch and that's a story you tell earlier because
[03:46:23] he saw that we had shared residency there. History is a wellspring of life saving lessons. No
[03:46:31] one really invents anything. Successful leaders recognize those traits and encourage them even at the
[03:46:38] risk of bending a rule or a jet once in a while. And you close out the book with this. Well that's
[03:46:49] what naval aviation would look like if I were king of everything. Since I'm not, I think I
[03:46:57] ought to call it a night. Come on inside. I have one last thing to show you. I kept my 1950s Ray
[03:47:04] Bands until just a few years ago when I replaced the lenses and gave them to my granddaughter
[03:47:09] at her request as a Christmas gift. At 50 years I figured it was time for a new pair.
[03:47:15] My youngest daughter Candace ended up with my star of David and Gold Chain.
[03:47:21] But I still have my little mouse. After all the C-duty he endured, he enjoys a cushy retirement
[03:47:27] on my bookshelf. From time to time I look at him and say it was a hell of a ride,
[03:47:32] wasn't it little fella. He is surrounded by books and other treasured items from my career.
[03:47:40] But what I value most was my time at Miramar with the Bros. They're enduring friendship
[03:47:47] or my real treasures, not any physical things in my library. Top Gun will always be the centerpiece
[03:47:54] of my career and my life's most important accomplishment. None of it would have happened without the
[03:48:01] Bros or the ever-present hands of God. Thank you.
[03:48:17] Yeah. You know what you do? You're really my compliments. And you know,
[03:48:28] it didn't in well. I didn't stay on in the Navy. But I got out.
[03:48:38] Come over to the desert. Let me host you. Come on over and I'll show you. I'll live.
[03:48:43] It's completely care we had. I got a home up there and an apartment adjacent to it.
[03:48:49] It's full of our son, the doctor and his girlfriend who's a college officer there every weekend with us.
[03:48:56] Life is good. And how I stayed in the Navy had you stayed in the Navy? Who did tell what you
[03:49:05] did? You know what? I found right afterwards it's in here. After 32 years, I found total happiness.
[03:49:16] And between us, we've done it all. We've been all over the world. We've got the home.
[03:49:24] Everything we've done has just been so enjoyable. Well, you know, sir, as I read this book and
[03:49:36] just think about the incredible life that you've lived. And even when you talk about what you've
[03:49:43] done since you left the Navy. And it sounds awesome. But no doubt. I mean, without question, the
[03:49:54] legacy that you left and your bros left in the Navy, in the aviation community, in the military
[03:50:02] to have an attitude to push the envelope, to take risks, to push back when things don't make
[03:50:08] sense that is a legacy that will never die. I know that now. It's been a remarkable day. I've
[03:50:21] done a lot of interviews, maybe a hundred. But I've never done anything I enjoyed more than today.
[03:50:28] You keep in touch with me. Sir, I admire what you're doing. And you know the philosophy and
[03:50:43] what you're building the followers. You can make a lot of money on the outside. I know that
[03:50:50] we've done fine. But you will never. I've got a lot of friends. But you'll never have the quality
[03:51:00] of friendship. You have with the brotherhood. The brotherhood is sales, UDT, guys, a history.
[03:51:07] You won't find those out there. The guy called in there to Godfather that when I got out,
[03:51:14] he kept me going. Not financially, but advice and mentoring. And pray and pray and man.
[03:51:24] Daryl Gary, if you really want to interview some people, interview Daryl Gary, condor.
[03:51:32] I won't get into his personal wealth at his bins. But he and he lives a spiritual Santa Fe.
[03:51:40] That told us. I got to be honest with you. You being here. This is not, I kind of had a sense of what
[03:51:46] there would be like. I was off a lot. This is really, this is really special for me to listen to the
[03:51:52] conversation between you and Jaco. I know Jaco and I know you having never known you. I think the
[03:51:59] way you describe it is everybody knows yank. Look, I was just a bro for three years. And I spent
[03:52:05] most of my time. I've done so much less than I've been given. It's kind of crazy to sit here and listen
[03:52:14] to you tell all these stories about all these places. And I've been to every one of them. I was a
[03:52:19] Marine at Miramar because you guys left in anger to South, took over top Guns Spaces as a Marine.
[03:52:26] I was a training officer at Top Gun. You could buy count on your hands and a Marine that ever
[03:52:32] gotten to do that because I went to an air show at El Toro when I was five. And so now I'm sitting here
[03:52:38] listening and talking about all the things you did and it just adds more to the pile of things that have
[03:52:44] happened to me beyond my control that let me do all these other cool things that by myself I could have
[03:52:49] never ever done. And I have a shred of connection to the legacy to read a book and give it to Jaco.
[03:52:58] Hey man, we might want to do this. I could probably set this thing up and then from the
[03:53:02] outside watch the conversation between two other people and for the first time in my career
[03:53:08] start to recognize how much bigger this thing really is than I ever understood because I lived
[03:53:14] inside of it and I was just working. I didn't know what I was doing. I was just working.
[03:53:18] It's probably just a short of a top Gun and I was just working and then I left and I want to do
[03:53:22] other things. And now I'm sitting here learning more about what I did than I ever knew while I was
[03:53:29] doing it. And it's just another reminder of how much more I have. There's so much how much more I need to
[03:53:37] learn how much less I know than I should. There's the been the best four hours man to sit here and
[03:53:44] watch the legacy you built and to let someone like me get a little touch of what that's like
[03:53:50] to be a part of that has been this has been an awesome awesome. You made it happen you and Jaco
[03:53:54] you sir. Well sir I've had you locked up in here for four hours. When you finish the next book
[03:54:05] A at Mary Beth's recommendation I volunteered to read it I'll do the audio book and I'll do this one
[03:54:13] if you want me to I'm here and when you want anytime you want to come back anytime that any one
[03:54:19] that you know that you want to have come on and share their stories this door is open it's an
[03:54:24] honor to talk to you thank you for your service and thanks for coming on today. Thank you for the
[03:54:29] thank you for the time and thank you be happy on behalf of the boroughs. And with that Dan
[03:54:38] Peterson has left the building awesome to have him on day thanks for coming by. I was
[03:54:47] suspecting that perhaps that podcast we would touch on a bunch of things but wouldn't dive too deep
[03:54:57] on certain subjects that got raised in my head so we're gonna actually have to follow up we'll do
[03:55:02] another podcast. Well actually the next podcast Dave if you don't mind I want to drill down on some
[03:55:09] of this stuff because Dan just opens up a whole new world that you know you know and so we'll do
[03:55:19] some deep dive on that on the next one right on us awesome to have awesome to have a guy like that on here
[03:55:26] just an honor to be able to talk to guys like that who spent their life
[03:55:31] trying to get better something we should all probably be doing trying to get better.
[03:55:43] Echo since you agree yes how would you give us some recommendations on how do we get better how to
[03:55:50] stay on the path how to improve on the path all right well jockel few is one way to stay on the path
[03:55:58] all right sometimes we need help we need help on the path so we will turn to jockel feel okay
[03:56:04] what is this supplements joint warfare these for your joints joint warfare superkrill oil
[03:56:09] discipline and discipline go also milk for additional protein in the form of the

[03:56:42] little psychological boost and a little physiological boost take them both utilizing both that's what I'm

[03:56:59] every day yeah it's part of my regimen you can smell the garlic it's it's preemptive yeah
[03:57:06] I don't want to react to the war I want to get out in front of that war I'm going to wage war in advance
[03:57:11] like cold war absolutely so I I was my daughter a couple months ago is getting sick
[03:57:16] and I was like hey you know what you take these you know takes some cold war and she says I don't
[03:57:23] like taking she doesn't like taking pills and I go no problem you know what I'll put some and
[03:57:28] I'll break them open put it in the glass stirred up you can just drink it bro you cannot do that
[03:57:35] with cold war you can not do that with cold war it is it was so it smelled so bad it was so offensive
[03:57:43] to drink because I drank it but it was everything in my power to get it down my daughter said
[03:57:48] I my daughter this is my 10 year old daughter you know she said I'm not drinking that I said cool

[03:58:09] could it could it convey them but more you know inspiring messages for as the taste oh yeah
[03:58:14] you know actually I don't think it's it snaps by the way there's two things I confirmed with my
[03:58:19] daughters you can say either it snapped or it slaps the way I don't try and get on it I have the
[03:58:28] the the the the individuals that are in the game yeah that was I was I got someone you know
[03:58:33] educated me on it said it was probably it slaps and I kind of recalled a little bit I heard someone
[03:58:38] say it slaps before it was about a song if I'm not mistaken so I'm like okay it slaps
[03:58:43] jock will hurt you wrong it snaps I've never heard it snaps I now to put myself on report my kids
[03:58:51] also say she snapped so maybe I didn't fuse him like if you did a good job on the GJ2
