00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.80
This is Jocco podcast number 11 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:17.000
And additionally today we have our first guest, Lathe Badham.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.40
Lathe welcome to the show.

4
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:21.40
Thank you, glad to be here with you.

5
00:00:21.40 --> 00:00:26.60
Now to begin this podcast today, I'm going to start at the end.

6
00:00:26.60 --> 00:00:33.60
I'm going to start at the end of my Navy career when I retired from the seal teams after

7
00:00:33.60 --> 00:00:36.72
20 years.

8
00:00:36.72 --> 00:00:41.92
And this is the speech that I gave on my last day of military service, my last day in the

9
00:00:41.92 --> 00:00:48.92
seal teams in about an hour before I walked back to the trade at building, cleaned the last

10
00:00:48.92 --> 00:00:56.92
things out of my locker, loaded them into my car, and drove away from the seal teams for

11
00:00:56.92 --> 00:00:59.92
the last time.

12
00:00:59.92 --> 00:01:06.20
With 20 years of memories and experiences and the best times of my life and the worst times

13
00:01:06.20 --> 00:01:13.60
of my life, all rushing through my mind.

14
00:01:13.60 --> 00:01:21.32
And this is the speech I gave that day.

15
00:01:21.32 --> 00:01:26.96
During my last deployment to Iraq in 2006, one of the first things we did was a series

16
00:01:26.96 --> 00:01:30.80
of operations on the eastern side of our body.

17
00:01:30.80 --> 00:01:36.20
In order to execute these operations, we took a majority of the seals to camp Corregador,

18
00:01:36.20 --> 00:01:41.60
home with the first of the 506 band of brothers, on the edge of the Malab district of

19
00:01:41.60 --> 00:01:44.64
the Marama of Ramadi.

20
00:01:44.64 --> 00:01:48.28
Camp Corregador was like four to pop lips.

21
00:01:48.28 --> 00:01:54.40
They received mortar fire, RPGs, and small arms fire daily.

22
00:01:54.40 --> 00:01:59.08
The barracks were an old partially blown out building with sandbags and the windows, dirt

23
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:02.12
floors, and nowhere conditioning.

24
00:02:02.12 --> 00:02:04.80
There were no showers.

25
00:02:04.80 --> 00:02:08.36
It was hard-living.

26
00:02:08.36 --> 00:02:14.76
As far as the fighting, Charlie Company, from the first of the 506 who we were set to work

27
00:02:14.76 --> 00:02:20.04
with, had suffered almost 40 casualties in the time they had been in Ramadi and had gone

28
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:26.48
from a fighting force of 140 to just over 100.

29
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:29.88
Charlie Company loved having seals with them.

30
00:02:29.88 --> 00:02:33.48
After the first operation they conducted with seals, the company commander told his

31
00:02:33.48 --> 00:02:41.04
battalion CEO he wanted seals with him on every mission to help keep his men alive.

32
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:46.40
As we continued these initial operations into the Malab district, there were heavy firefights,

33
00:02:46.40 --> 00:02:51.48
many dead enemy, and multiple coalition casualties.

34
00:02:51.48 --> 00:02:57.12
It was intense, sustained combat.

35
00:02:57.12 --> 00:03:03.24
Many would have considered camp Corregador an eastern Ramadi to be hell on earth.

36
00:03:03.24 --> 00:03:07.64
I knew it was exactly where seals belonged.

37
00:03:07.64 --> 00:03:13.40
We soon completed that first run of missions and headed back to our main camp.

38
00:03:13.40 --> 00:03:18.56
When we got there, I told one of the platoon commanders I wanted him to select guys to form

39
00:03:18.56 --> 00:03:24.28
a seven-man squad to take back to camp Corregador.

40
00:03:24.28 --> 00:03:28.20
But he told me he didn't want to just pick guys.

41
00:03:28.20 --> 00:03:32.36
He thought that some guys might not want to go back to Corregador due to the hard-living

42
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:38.28
conditions, the tough fighting, and the high rate of casualties.

43
00:03:38.28 --> 00:03:43.96
That sounded reasonable to me, so I mustered the whole troop in the planning space.

44
00:03:43.96 --> 00:03:48.80
I explained to them that we were sending a squad to Corregador permanently because the army

45
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:55.000
isn't a tough fight and suffering heavy casualties, and that as Americans as servicemen

46
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.80
and as frogmen we cannot sit on the sidelines as that happens.

47
00:03:59.80 --> 00:04:05.80
If there's a fight, we need to be in it.

48
00:04:05.80 --> 00:04:13.16
I wrote on the dry erase board camp Corregador volunteers, and I said to this pack of seals,

49
00:04:13.16 --> 00:04:17.72
if you want to go over to Corregador, if you want to volunteer to be in the worst area

50
00:04:17.72 --> 00:04:21.84
with the worst-living conditions, with the hardest fighting, and with the highest chances

51
00:04:21.84 --> 00:04:28.04
of getting hurt or killed, then go ahead and write your name up on that board.

52
00:04:28.04 --> 00:04:30.04
And then I walked out of the room.

53
00:04:30.04 --> 00:04:40.04
A short while later, I came back in and I looked at the list on the board.

54
00:04:40.04 --> 00:04:42.40
It was filled.

55
00:04:42.40 --> 00:04:48.12
In fact, every single seal to a man had written his name on that board.

56
00:04:48.12 --> 00:05:04.88
Yes, every man had volunteered to go forward into that raging storm.

57
00:05:04.88 --> 00:05:08.76
And that is who we are.

58
00:05:08.76 --> 00:05:11.92
That is what we joined the seal teams for.

59
00:05:11.92 --> 00:05:14.28
To do what no one else can do.

60
00:05:14.28 --> 00:05:23.52
In the worst areas, in the worst conditions, we crave the dirt and sweat and fire and blood.

61
00:05:23.52 --> 00:05:26.12
Let there be no doubt.

62
00:05:26.12 --> 00:05:27.92
It is in our soul.

63
00:05:27.92 --> 00:05:32.04
It is in our nature.

64
00:05:32.04 --> 00:05:38.28
Sure seals can do any job well, but it isn't the belly of the beast where we thrive.

65
00:05:38.28 --> 00:05:44.88
I have seen with my own eyes the wholesale slaughter that occurs when seals are unleashed on the enemy

66
00:05:44.88 --> 00:05:47.72
as we were meant to be.

67
00:05:47.72 --> 00:05:50.20
And it is incredible thing.

68
00:05:50.20 --> 00:05:53.72
It is also a thing of strategic impact.

69
00:05:53.72 --> 00:05:59.60
Areas like Ramadi and Satter City, which after years of complete enemy control, become

70
00:05:59.60 --> 00:06:06.16
pacified, soon after the sword of overwhelming carnage, is wielded by the frogmen on

71
00:06:06.16 --> 00:06:09.52
the high ground.

72
00:06:09.52 --> 00:06:11.32
This is who we are.

73
00:06:11.32 --> 00:06:26.56
Death dealers, killers, executioners, and in being so, saviors, defenders, warriors.

74
00:06:26.56 --> 00:06:33.000
Now there are those that say we need to change, evolve and mature.

75
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.52
They claim that the nature of war has changed, that it is more complex and demands a more

76
00:06:38.52 --> 00:06:41.36
sensitive approach.

77
00:06:41.36 --> 00:06:45.32
I say they are wrong.

78
00:06:45.32 --> 00:06:49.08
War may morph and appear different through the ages.

79
00:06:49.08 --> 00:06:55.24
And when you live through a war and you see it up close like we are now, you may notice

80
00:06:55.24 --> 00:07:02.36
complexities that you didn't perceive about the wars you studied in history class.

81
00:07:02.36 --> 00:07:07.08
But I tell you, there is nothing new.

82
00:07:07.08 --> 00:07:12.08
The nature of war has never changed and never will change.

83
00:07:12.08 --> 00:07:14.92
The nature of war is death.

84
00:07:14.92 --> 00:07:18.44
To kill the enemy before he kills you.

85
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:24.40
The rest is details.

86
00:07:24.40 --> 00:07:27.56
Now of course we can handle the details.

87
00:07:27.56 --> 00:07:32.32
In fact, seals can excel at all of them, gathering intelligence, assembling in from

88
00:07:32.32 --> 00:07:39.60
information, forming alliances, rebuilding communities, training, protecting, treating,

89
00:07:39.60 --> 00:07:42.40
seals can do anything.

90
00:07:42.40 --> 00:07:46.04
But these details can also be done by others.

91
00:07:46.04 --> 00:07:50.20
You don't need to be a seal to conduct those activities.

92
00:07:50.20 --> 00:07:56.000
I say, send seals forward into the violent fray.

93
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.84
Senses will no one else can go to do what no one else can do.

94
00:08:00.84 --> 00:08:05.72
The seal to find and butcher our enemy's soulless masses and leave nothing behind but

95
00:08:05.72 --> 00:08:09.84
scorched earth and rubbled buildings.

96
00:08:09.84 --> 00:08:13.80
That is our nature.

97
00:08:13.80 --> 00:08:20.80
As I look at the seal teams today, I say to you all, yes, absolutely evolve.

98
00:08:20.80 --> 00:08:25.04
Get smarter, better, faster, more creative.

99
00:08:25.04 --> 00:08:28.80
Learn to mitigate risk when you can.

100
00:08:28.80 --> 00:08:32.24
Figure out new ways to win.

101
00:08:32.24 --> 00:08:37.56
Attack the enemy in new ways using information and intelligence.

102
00:08:37.56 --> 00:08:43.92
Infiltrate the enemy and turn him against himself, evil against evil.

103
00:08:43.92 --> 00:08:48.000
Adapt and overcome changing enemy tactics.

104
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.04
By all means, evolve and get better every day, every chance you get.

105
00:08:56.04 --> 00:09:03.16
You don't forget the nature of war and don't forget the nature of seals.

106
00:09:03.16 --> 00:09:10.96
We must train brutally and without mercy so we can fight the same way, brutally and without

107
00:09:10.96 --> 00:09:12.96
mercy.

108
00:09:12.96 --> 00:09:18.56
Our job is to close with and destroy the enemy and we do it better than anyone.

109
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:24.04
Yes, our current wars will someday end.

110
00:09:24.04 --> 00:09:30.52
World war indoors before man was war weighted for him.

111
00:09:30.52 --> 00:09:34.96
As long as man is, war will always be.

112
00:09:34.96 --> 00:09:39.72
Always.

113
00:09:39.72 --> 00:09:45.000
And our great nation will always need men to do what is in our nature.

114
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.60
Kill the enemy.

115
00:09:46.60 --> 00:09:48.16
Kill him as he sleeps.

116
00:09:48.16 --> 00:09:49.60
Kill him as he plots.

117
00:09:49.60 --> 00:09:51.04
Kill him as he hides.

118
00:09:51.04 --> 00:09:53.52
Kill him as he fights.

119
00:09:53.52 --> 00:10:03.52
That is our nature and that is our solemn duty.

120
00:10:03.52 --> 00:10:06.48
Light the fire.

121
00:10:06.48 --> 00:10:09.44
Take the torch, hold it high.

122
00:10:09.44 --> 00:10:13.52
Let it burn bright.

123
00:10:13.52 --> 00:10:19.96
Let it supply the warmth and light of freedom and liberty for our countrymen.

124
00:10:19.96 --> 00:10:23.88
And also let the fire and sinnerate our enemy.

125
00:10:23.88 --> 00:10:29.56
Let the inferno consume everything he is, everything he ever will be and everything he has

126
00:10:29.56 --> 00:10:34.000
ever held sacred.

127
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.44
As I walk away from the teams today, I assure you I will never forget.

128
00:10:41.44 --> 00:10:44.68
I will never forget your service and sacrifice.

129
00:10:44.68 --> 00:10:50.36
I will never forget you, my fellow seals, forgetting me here to this day for leading me,

130
00:10:50.36 --> 00:10:54.28
for following me and for watching my back.

131
00:10:54.28 --> 00:10:59.52
I will never forget our fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that are fought and

132
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:02.68
sacrificed so much.

133
00:11:02.68 --> 00:11:08.44
I will never forget those big tough frog men and hardcore seals that came before me.

134
00:11:08.44 --> 00:11:14.04
Particularly the ones that raised me in the teams and taught me the true way of the frog

135
00:11:14.04 --> 00:11:16.56
man.

136
00:11:16.56 --> 00:11:22.36
And finally, I will never forget our fallen brothers, the many seals who have sacrificed their

137
00:11:22.36 --> 00:11:25.56
lives for our freedom.

138
00:11:25.56 --> 00:11:34.80
Especially Mark Lee, Mike Mansour and Ryan Job of Seal Team 3 Task Unit Bruser who lived

139
00:11:34.80 --> 00:11:42.20
and fought and died like warriors.

140
00:11:42.20 --> 00:11:47.88
I am humbled to have served with you all and I will never forget.

141
00:11:47.88 --> 00:11:49.24
Thank you.

142
00:11:49.24 --> 00:11:54.52
God bless the teams and God bless the United States of America.

143
00:11:54.52 --> 00:12:02.88
And then I walked away.

144
00:12:02.88 --> 00:12:11.28
Now I often talk about the Marine Corps and I talk about the Army soldiers and I talk

145
00:12:11.28 --> 00:12:21.28
about the immense respect and admiration that I and that we as seals have for them.

146
00:12:21.28 --> 00:12:27.000
But if you haven't noticed, I don't usually talk about the seal teams and the frogmen

147
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.24
that filled those ranks, probably because I was raised not to talk about what we do.

148
00:12:35.24 --> 00:12:38.04
But let there be no doubt.

149
00:12:38.04 --> 00:12:43.48
I hold the seal teams and the brotherhood of the teams sacred.

150
00:12:43.48 --> 00:12:50.12
The seal teams is not just what I did, it is who I am.

151
00:12:50.12 --> 00:12:53.72
And really, it all culminated.

152
00:12:53.72 --> 00:13:00.36
It reached his peak in the highlight of my life, which was being in command of Task Unit

153
00:13:00.36 --> 00:13:06.56
Bruser in Ramadi, Iraq.

154
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:10.64
The student Bruser was my vision of the teams.

155
00:13:10.64 --> 00:13:14.12
It was everything I had always wanted the teams to be.

156
00:13:14.12 --> 00:13:22.84
Badass frogmen, tough, mean, funny, aggressive, professional seals.

157
00:13:22.84 --> 00:13:26.000
Seals that take the fight to the enemy.

158
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.60
Like our legendary forefathers in Vietnam, seals that the enemy feared because we haunted

159
00:13:31.60 --> 00:13:36.52
them down and killed them.

160
00:13:36.52 --> 00:13:44.20
Task Unit Bruser was what I always wanted the seal teams to be.

161
00:13:44.20 --> 00:13:49.88
But I was not Task Unit Bruser.

162
00:13:49.88 --> 00:13:57.48
Yes, I was the commander, but Task Unit Bruser was by no means me.

163
00:13:57.48 --> 00:14:03.48
Task Unit Bruser was the men, especially a core group within the group that held the standard

164
00:14:03.48 --> 00:14:08.56
and carried the fire.

165
00:14:08.56 --> 00:14:16.88
It was those men that I am internally indebted for, for giving me that gift, for fulfilling

166
00:14:16.88 --> 00:14:25.98
the vision that I had, men like Mark Lee and Mike Montsour and Ryan Job, men like Chris

167
00:14:25.98 --> 00:14:26.98
Kyle.

168
00:14:26.98 --> 00:14:36.38
And those are the ones that we talk about, we talk about them only because they are gone.

169
00:14:36.38 --> 00:14:42.90
But there were many others in that core group who go on silently unknown to the world,

170
00:14:42.90 --> 00:14:47.58
most of whom are still in the fight.

171
00:14:47.58 --> 00:14:55.02
And it was those men, of course those fallen warriors that made the ultimate sacrifice.

172
00:14:55.02 --> 00:15:02.38
But also those unnamed men of Task Unit Bruser who held the line and marched into the

173
00:15:02.38 --> 00:15:28.62
fray over and over again for me and for the teams and for the navy and for our great nation.

174
00:15:28.62 --> 00:15:35.82
One of them here tonight, his name is Lave Babin.

175
00:15:35.82 --> 00:15:40.10
And I'm going to let him talk about where he comes from and how we ended up in the teams.

176
00:15:40.10 --> 00:15:44.62
But before I do that I want to tell you something about Lave.

177
00:15:44.62 --> 00:15:49.82
After we got done with our work up and before we went on deployment, before we went

178
00:15:49.82 --> 00:15:50.82
to Ramadi.

179
00:15:50.82 --> 00:15:54.68
I was talking to Lave and I was talking to the other platoon commander together, the Delta

180
00:15:54.68 --> 00:15:59.92
Platoon commander and Lave was the Charlie Platoon commander.

181
00:15:59.92 --> 00:16:04.52
And I said to them, both, I'm going to get you guys more combat than you can take.

182
00:16:04.52 --> 00:16:08.36
I'm going to break you.

183
00:16:08.36 --> 00:16:11.88
And I was half joking.

184
00:16:11.88 --> 00:16:19.24
But at the same time, I had actually already seen men break during a fairly simple deployment

185
00:16:19.24 --> 00:16:22.60
to Iraq.

186
00:16:22.60 --> 00:16:26.32
But I knew I would push these guys hard.

187
00:16:26.32 --> 00:16:35.84
And through timing and fate and force of will, the battle field of Ramadi gave me the

188
00:16:35.84 --> 00:16:41.64
opportunity to make that happen, to push them and try and give them more combat than they

189
00:16:41.64 --> 00:16:48.32
could take.

190
00:16:48.32 --> 00:16:50.68
But they took it.

191
00:16:50.68 --> 00:16:55.48
And they took it far beyond what I ever could have asked for.

192
00:16:55.48 --> 00:17:01.16
These two officers, the platoon commanders, and with them that core group of fragment of

193
00:17:01.16 --> 00:17:08.68
warriors in Task Unit Bruser, they never wavered.

194
00:17:08.68 --> 00:17:11.80
They never coward.

195
00:17:11.80 --> 00:17:17.44
They never faltered.

196
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:23.52
They were in the face of bombs and bullets and fire and death.

197
00:17:23.52 --> 00:17:29.32
They held true.

198
00:17:29.32 --> 00:17:34.76
And I will never forget that.

199
00:17:34.76 --> 00:17:38.88
And so here is one of those men.

200
00:17:38.88 --> 00:17:47.12
One of that core group of hard warriors from Task Unit Bruser that held the line.

201
00:17:47.12 --> 00:17:56.56
My friend, my teammate and my brother, Lave Babin.

202
00:17:56.56 --> 00:17:59.28
Galco thanks for having me.

203
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:01.56
I'm fired up to be here.

204
00:18:01.56 --> 00:18:02.56
Yeah.

205
00:18:02.56 --> 00:18:10.48
So it's interesting because, like I said, I mean, as I go back and listen to podcasts and

206
00:18:10.48 --> 00:18:17.08
hear what I talk about and how much respect and admiration that I always talk about.

207
00:18:17.08 --> 00:18:19.92
For the Marine Corps and for the Army.

208
00:18:19.92 --> 00:18:24.20
And I seldom talk about the boys.

209
00:18:24.20 --> 00:18:29.76
And as I was getting ready to have you on as the first guest, which is very appropriate,

210
00:18:29.76 --> 00:18:40.44
I wanted to make sure that everybody understood where I was coming from.

211
00:18:40.44 --> 00:18:46.44
And I think people were really excited that you're going to be on.

212
00:18:46.44 --> 00:18:52.84
Having a lot of them read the book that you and I wrote together extreme ownership.

213
00:18:52.84 --> 00:19:01.80
And being intrigued about that and having had me on the podcast and talk about my life,

214
00:19:01.80 --> 00:19:05.60
people are interested here in a little bit about your life.

215
00:19:05.60 --> 00:19:10.60
That's kind of one of the first questions that came across as soon as I told everyone that

216
00:19:10.60 --> 00:19:12.32
you were going to be on the podcast.

217
00:19:12.32 --> 00:19:17.48
And that was, you know, what was, here's a question.

218
00:19:17.48 --> 00:19:18.72
First question of the day.

219
00:19:18.72 --> 00:19:21.84
Let's break it down.

220
00:19:21.84 --> 00:19:26.32
What was the motivation behind life becoming a seal?

221
00:19:26.32 --> 00:19:37.64
And if he can give a brief resume of his career in the forces, break out your resume.

222
00:19:37.64 --> 00:19:40.52
I don't ever remember what to do anything else.

223
00:19:40.52 --> 00:19:46.84
And I've heard you say, you know, that you wanted to go be a commandil.

224
00:19:46.84 --> 00:19:50.04
I've never said you could remember being wanting to do anything.

225
00:19:50.04 --> 00:19:52.04
And I think I was exactly the same way.

226
00:19:52.04 --> 00:19:53.72
It was, I felt growing up.

227
00:19:53.72 --> 00:19:58.40
I grew up in the Pani Woods of Southeast Texas in a rural small town.

228
00:19:58.40 --> 00:20:01.44
And we're high school football is everything.

229
00:20:01.44 --> 00:20:03.08
It's just a few thousand people in the town.

230
00:20:03.08 --> 00:20:10.48
You get at least that or more at the games or Friday night lights every Friday.

231
00:20:10.48 --> 00:20:13.08
And I ran around the woods.

232
00:20:13.08 --> 00:20:17.72
I played Army and I wanted to be a combat leader.

233
00:20:17.72 --> 00:20:18.72
That's what I wanted to do.

234
00:20:18.72 --> 00:20:23.16
And I played Sandbox, my GI Joe figures, my little plastic army men.

235
00:20:23.16 --> 00:20:24.80
And that just kind of what I wanted to do.

236
00:20:24.80 --> 00:20:31.36
And then when I was, when I was probably in, I was probably in about junior high school.

237
00:20:31.36 --> 00:20:34.96
And I was kind of figuring out, I hear about the green berets.

238
00:20:34.96 --> 00:20:40.16
I had a cousin that was a green beret, highly decorated silver star recipient from Vietnam.

239
00:20:40.16 --> 00:20:44.80
And he was kind of a mentor to my dad growing up.

240
00:20:44.80 --> 00:20:49.36
And so I heard a little bit about some of those, you know, the snake eaters and sort of

241
00:20:49.36 --> 00:20:50.36
ring some books.

242
00:20:50.36 --> 00:20:52.60
And I sort of learned about the seal teams.

243
00:20:52.60 --> 00:20:58.32
And I remember distinctly a little movie coming out.

244
00:20:58.32 --> 00:20:59.60
And I think it was 1990.

245
00:20:59.60 --> 00:21:06.92
But a little movie called Navy Seals, starring Charlie Sheen, who's all about winning.

246
00:21:06.92 --> 00:21:10.72
And he should have actually joined the teams and saved the team.

247
00:21:10.72 --> 00:21:12.32
He'd probably be a better shape right now.

248
00:21:12.32 --> 00:21:13.32
No doubt.

249
00:21:13.32 --> 00:21:15.12
You definitely would have been better for him.

250
00:21:15.12 --> 00:21:16.32
No doubt.

251
00:21:16.32 --> 00:21:20.16
But that really was something that kind of propelled me out.

252
00:21:20.16 --> 00:21:21.16
What is this?

253
00:21:21.16 --> 00:21:22.92
Or is this sort of reading about it?

254
00:21:22.92 --> 00:21:23.92
Sort of learning about it.

255
00:21:23.92 --> 00:21:26.68
Reading a lot of books about seals and Vietnam.

256
00:21:26.68 --> 00:21:29.000
And decided that that's what I wanted to do.

257
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I wanted to be a seal.

258
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.04
So I went to the Naval Canada, pursue that dream.

259
00:21:33.04 --> 00:21:37.44
And I knew that's what I wanted to do.

260
00:21:37.44 --> 00:21:40.24
I turned down an appointment to West Point because I wanted to go Navy.

261
00:21:40.24 --> 00:21:41.64
I wanted to be a seal.

262
00:21:41.64 --> 00:21:45.36
And law and behold, as I graduated from the Naval care, I came up with a service selection

263
00:21:45.36 --> 00:21:47.44
night before our graduation.

264
00:21:47.44 --> 00:21:49.48
I did not get selected for the seal teams.

265
00:21:49.48 --> 00:21:50.92
And that was crushing.

266
00:21:50.92 --> 00:21:53.36
It was a soul crushing of that for me.

267
00:21:53.36 --> 00:21:56.16
To think that I was going to go out in the surface fleet.

268
00:21:56.16 --> 00:21:57.32
I wasn't going to be a seal.

269
00:21:57.32 --> 00:21:59.72
I was going to go be on a ship.

270
00:21:59.72 --> 00:22:02.16
Be a service war for our officer.

271
00:22:02.16 --> 00:22:03.56
Yet it took me three years.

272
00:22:03.56 --> 00:22:05.24
I continue to pursue that.

273
00:22:05.24 --> 00:22:07.60
And persevere to a lot of challenges.

274
00:22:07.60 --> 00:22:08.84
And through a lot of luck.

275
00:22:08.84 --> 00:22:14.04
And a lot of our work, the doors were open for me to be able to go to get a bill to go.

276
00:22:14.04 --> 00:22:16.56
And I had some outstanding mentors that looked out for me.

277
00:22:16.56 --> 00:22:19.32
It opened some doors for me to make that happen.

278
00:22:19.32 --> 00:22:23.44
And then I was able to go and go to Buds, our seal training.

279
00:22:23.44 --> 00:22:28.32
And when I was there, I think looking back on that time in the surface fleet was awesome

280
00:22:28.32 --> 00:22:29.32
for me.

281
00:22:29.32 --> 00:22:34.16
It allowed me to gain immense responsibility and maturity.

282
00:22:34.16 --> 00:22:37.000
But I probably wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

283
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.60
And in kind of the peacetime, pre-911 seal teams as an assistant to a commander, they

284
00:22:41.60 --> 00:22:43.84
wouldn't have an opportunity for leadership.

285
00:22:43.84 --> 00:22:46.32
And so I was thrust into leadership positions in the surface fleet.

286
00:22:46.32 --> 00:22:47.32
And I gained that.

287
00:22:47.32 --> 00:22:50.48
And I also gained a measure of just appreciation for where I was.

288
00:22:50.48 --> 00:22:55.60
And whenever one was, when other folks were whining about how tough training was, I was

289
00:22:55.60 --> 00:22:59.20
just excited and fired up to be there just for the opportunity.

290
00:22:59.20 --> 00:23:06.56
And so for me, I went and served at a seal team as a assistant to a commander and certainly

291
00:23:06.56 --> 00:23:10.92
the highlight of my time of the teams was working at the task of the bruser.

292
00:23:10.92 --> 00:23:19.08
And I felt like that's where I had not had that experience, which I almost didn't get,

293
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:20.08
by the way.

294
00:23:20.08 --> 00:23:23.32
I mean, that was, I wanted to stay at, I was at seal team five.

295
00:23:23.32 --> 00:23:27.64
And I wanted to stay at seal team five with the guys that I loved and trained with.

296
00:23:27.64 --> 00:23:30.56
And I, my commanding officer at the time said, no, you're seeing you're going to rotate

297
00:23:30.56 --> 00:23:31.56
you to seal team three.

298
00:23:31.56 --> 00:23:33.56
You're going to deploy six months ahead.

299
00:23:33.56 --> 00:23:36.000
I was furious about that.

300
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.20
Then I was going over there in Lomba Hold.

301
00:23:38.20 --> 00:23:41.80
I get over and get the word for Jocco and task in it, bruser.

302
00:23:41.80 --> 00:23:44.16
And that was an amazing crew of guys from Charlie Batoon.

303
00:23:44.16 --> 00:23:48.08
That was, and it just wouldn't have been the same otherwise.

304
00:23:48.08 --> 00:23:53.76
And I still love the boys from Team Five of course, but it was just a phenomenal experience

305
00:23:53.76 --> 00:23:54.76
to be able to have that.

306
00:23:54.76 --> 00:23:59.68
To talk me to be the combat leader, I needed to be through a workup cycle, preparing me

307
00:23:59.68 --> 00:24:03.20
and then unleashed me and Charlie Batoon on the battlefield to get after it in a way

308
00:24:03.20 --> 00:24:09.24
that was phenomenal where we were able to have a historic deployment that made it impact

309
00:24:09.24 --> 00:24:11.92
and save a lot of lives and to tremendous damage to the enemy.

310
00:24:11.92 --> 00:24:16.92
And we came back from that from lessons learned, provided tons of lessons learned and taught

311
00:24:16.92 --> 00:24:20.28
seal leaders for the next generation.

312
00:24:20.28 --> 00:24:23.24
And that, that to me was such an incredibly rewarding experience.

313
00:24:23.24 --> 00:24:29.88
And I think someone that built our company now, Eschelon, for what we're doing and the ideas

314
00:24:29.88 --> 00:24:34.44
that have become the book, Extreme Ownership, where when I was teaching that leadership

315
00:24:34.44 --> 00:24:38.44
training and you were running training for the West Coast teams, providing those lessons

316
00:24:38.44 --> 00:24:44.40
learned to teach guys to be ready for those most difficult combat situations.

317
00:24:44.40 --> 00:24:49.76
And I was proud to train those guys and see the next generation of seal leaders go out

318
00:24:49.76 --> 00:24:54.40
on the battlefield and accomplish some extraordinary stuff and reprove the principles

319
00:24:54.40 --> 00:24:59.20
that we learned and revalidate them in different environments.

320
00:24:59.20 --> 00:25:03.72
And that was incredibly rewarding for me and I think really shaped when I decided to get out

321
00:25:03.72 --> 00:25:08.80
a few years ago after you'd retired and really shaped what this has become and it's still

322
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:15.88
rewarding to work with leaders in all aspects of businesses across industries and see them,

323
00:25:15.88 --> 00:25:20.44
see the light bulb come off in their head and watch them just go get after it and lead

324
00:25:20.44 --> 00:25:21.44
and win.

325
00:25:21.44 --> 00:25:28.72
Hey back when you said that you weren't selected to be a seal, what does that mean?

326
00:25:28.72 --> 00:25:30.44
You have to be selected.

327
00:25:30.44 --> 00:25:34.16
I can't just, hey I want to be a seal, let me join Buds.

328
00:25:34.16 --> 00:25:36.16
Let me get through that and become a seal.

329
00:25:36.16 --> 00:25:37.16
Like how does that work?

330
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:38.16
You have to get a billet to go.

331
00:25:38.16 --> 00:25:39.16
We call it billets.

332
00:25:39.16 --> 00:25:40.16
What does that mean?

333
00:25:40.16 --> 00:25:41.56
That means that you have a slot.

334
00:25:41.56 --> 00:25:42.56
You get a slot.

335
00:25:42.56 --> 00:25:44.80
Here's an opportunity and for us.

336
00:25:44.80 --> 00:25:45.80
We're coming out of the Naval County.

337
00:25:45.80 --> 00:25:48.04
We had 16 seal billets.

338
00:25:48.04 --> 00:25:49.04
So 16 people got to go.

339
00:25:49.04 --> 00:25:50.68
We had a priori list of seal in my class.

340
00:25:50.68 --> 00:25:52.84
Only 15 guys were getting to go.

341
00:25:52.84 --> 00:25:57.08
Probably had 200 people that wanted to go be a seal and you go through a screening process.

342
00:25:57.08 --> 00:26:02.08
And after that you may be have 60 or 80 people that are eligible to go and at least

343
00:26:02.08 --> 00:26:03.92
15 of those are going to get selected.

344
00:26:03.92 --> 00:26:05.48
I was not one of those 15.

345
00:26:05.48 --> 00:26:09.84
So as far as the process goes then you can't just be some dude.

346
00:26:09.84 --> 00:26:11.48
Like the screening process how you're saying.

347
00:26:11.48 --> 00:26:18.000
That's the case that you're missing is that there's two basically two parts of the military.

348
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.76
There's officers.

349
00:26:19.76 --> 00:26:21.000
And there's enlisted guys.

350
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.50
And they're officers.

351
00:26:22.50 --> 00:26:24.96
The basic requirement being officers you have to have a college degree.

352
00:26:24.96 --> 00:26:27.40
If you have a college degree then you can become an officer.

353
00:26:27.40 --> 00:26:29.48
And if you don't have a college degree then you're an enlisted guy.

354
00:26:29.48 --> 00:26:34.28
I enlisted in the Navy out of high school didn't have a degree.

355
00:26:34.28 --> 00:26:35.80
And therefore I had to.

356
00:26:35.80 --> 00:26:40.96
Therefore it was pretty easy to get to go to seal training because they take they need

357
00:26:40.96 --> 00:26:44.12
more enlisted seals than they need officers.

358
00:26:44.12 --> 00:26:48.84
And so it's pretty easy to get what they've talking about a billet as an enlisted guy.

359
00:26:48.84 --> 00:26:51.52
Because they just want to have they need you.

360
00:26:51.52 --> 00:26:55.44
The officers, there's all kinds of officers that want to be seal officers.

361
00:26:55.44 --> 00:26:56.88
So they have hundreds and hundreds.

362
00:26:56.88 --> 00:27:00.72
If not probably thousands of people that apply to be seal officers.

363
00:27:00.72 --> 00:27:05.28
And they you know they take a very small number of them at 30 or 40 a year.

364
00:27:05.28 --> 00:27:06.28
Topps.

365
00:27:06.28 --> 00:27:08.12
And within listed there's probably I don't know.

366
00:27:08.12 --> 00:27:11.56
A thousand a year that that that that show up and go through.

367
00:27:11.56 --> 00:27:13.52
And so that was the challenging part.

368
00:27:13.52 --> 00:27:17.88
And for me I actually didn't become an officer until I was already in the seal teams

369
00:27:17.88 --> 00:27:19.36
for eight years.

370
00:27:19.36 --> 00:27:23.64
And then and then once I once I did that it was it was a hard program that I got picked

371
00:27:23.64 --> 00:27:25.40
up for as well.

372
00:27:25.40 --> 00:27:30.32
But you know coming right out of the Naval Academy is very very hard to get one of those

373
00:27:30.32 --> 00:27:31.32
billets.

374
00:27:31.32 --> 00:27:35.96
But like Lave said and actually his sister, Patoon Commander that was in task in the

375
00:27:35.96 --> 00:27:40.64
freezer was the same way didn't get picked up had to go to the surface fleet and drive

376
00:27:40.64 --> 00:27:45.04
a ship for a while and then showed up at the seal teams and was he asking.

377
00:27:45.04 --> 00:27:47.76
We actually went through went through bugs together in the same blood class.

378
00:27:47.76 --> 00:27:48.76
Oh, okay.

379
00:27:48.76 --> 00:27:49.76
Yeah.

380
00:27:49.76 --> 00:27:53.08
And I actually liked it because you guys knew how to do some of the administrative

381
00:27:53.08 --> 00:27:56.72
stuff that most seal officers did not have any relations.

382
00:27:56.72 --> 00:27:58.12
Yeah, so that was awesome.

383
00:27:58.12 --> 00:28:05.08
So that so you say, um, if you're an officer it's harder.

384
00:28:05.08 --> 00:28:06.88
And they choose just a few guys, right?

385
00:28:06.88 --> 00:28:11.24
So if you're an officer, I'm not saying there's an officer it's harder, but there's

386
00:28:11.24 --> 00:28:13.12
there's less billets as Jack which is explained.

387
00:28:13.12 --> 00:28:14.12
Oh, okay.

388
00:28:14.12 --> 00:28:18.16
So what's that based on, you know, there's less like I'm going to choose him but not

389
00:28:18.16 --> 00:28:19.16
you.

390
00:28:19.16 --> 00:28:22.000
Is that based on the screening process or they based it on.

391
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.08
Well, so you get out of the different commissioning sources, they've got a certain number

392
00:28:26.08 --> 00:28:27.08
of billets aside.

393
00:28:27.08 --> 00:28:30.64
So and then you, it's, it's not luck.

394
00:28:30.64 --> 00:28:31.64
It's based on your record.

395
00:28:31.64 --> 00:28:33.88
Oh, it's based on your grades.

396
00:28:33.88 --> 00:28:34.88
It's cool.

397
00:28:34.88 --> 00:28:37.96
I mean, you had to have a high GPA, which I did not have.

398
00:28:37.96 --> 00:28:42.60
And then you had to have a, like, why don't you just rub salt in the woods and go down

399
00:28:42.60 --> 00:28:43.60
on the line.

400
00:28:43.60 --> 00:28:45.60
Just try to understand, you know.

401
00:28:45.60 --> 00:28:50.80
But now, you kind of think the other thing, you, they also based on, uh, PT scores as

402
00:28:50.80 --> 00:28:52.44
well, so it's physical training scores.

403
00:28:52.44 --> 00:28:54.96
You go through the seal fitness test.

404
00:28:54.96 --> 00:29:00.76
And so I mean, I'm going up against guys that are collegiate swimmers and, you know, cross

405
00:29:00.76 --> 00:29:06.96
country runners and, you know, folks like that who are crushing me on the test, you know,

406
00:29:06.96 --> 00:29:13.12
and, and putting up ludicrous numbers, whereas, so, so I could pass the test to go, but

407
00:29:13.12 --> 00:29:16.40
you got to go away and above and beyond that to even be competitive.

408
00:29:16.40 --> 00:29:19.04
So that's kind of where, you know, where it was difficult.

409
00:29:19.04 --> 00:29:24.20
The other issue I had was that I had a bit of a conduct record as well.

410
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:25.68
I got a lot of trouble.

411
00:29:25.68 --> 00:29:32.16
I started restriction and, uh, I marks a lot of tours and I had a lot of the merits and,

412
00:29:32.16 --> 00:29:38.10
uh, I went ahead some upper classmen who told me to do something I didn't like a couple

413
00:29:38.10 --> 00:29:39.10
times.

414
00:29:39.10 --> 00:29:40.10
I told them what I thought about it.

415
00:29:40.10 --> 00:29:41.10
And then I don't know.

416
00:29:41.10 --> 00:29:42.60
And they didn't work out too good for me.

417
00:29:42.60 --> 00:29:43.60
I'll drop the maker.

418
00:29:43.60 --> 00:29:44.60
All part of the learning experience.

419
00:29:44.60 --> 00:29:45.60
Yeah.

420
00:29:45.60 --> 00:29:55.60
So, uh, now another thing that obviously came up when, you know, it's a great thing.

421
00:29:55.60 --> 00:29:56.60
It's been coming up.

422
00:29:56.60 --> 00:29:59.12
It actually comes up all the time.

423
00:29:59.12 --> 00:30:05.60
And, you know, being in task and a bruiser, people heard that name and they've heard it,

424
00:30:05.60 --> 00:30:09.04
you know, obviously around Chris Kyle.

425
00:30:09.04 --> 00:30:14.88
And I've been asked since the podcast started, you know, can you talk about Chris Kyle

426
00:30:14.88 --> 00:30:18.80
and the whole time, I knew you were going to be coming on at some point and I've been

427
00:30:18.80 --> 00:30:25.36
waiting to talk about Chris until you were here.

428
00:30:25.36 --> 00:30:27.96
And, you know, people say, did you work with Chris?

429
00:30:27.96 --> 00:30:29.92
Did you know Chris?

430
00:30:29.92 --> 00:30:34.24
And the answer is yes.

431
00:30:34.24 --> 00:30:43.80
We absolutely worked with Chris and wanted to take just an opportunity to talk about Chris

432
00:30:43.80 --> 00:30:53.04
and one of the things that I would like to try and do is talk about Chris, the Chris

433
00:30:53.04 --> 00:30:54.04
that we knew.

434
00:30:54.04 --> 00:30:55.04
Right?

435
00:30:55.04 --> 00:30:59.24
And the Chris that lay for nine new, the Chris that the guys that are actually served

436
00:30:59.24 --> 00:31:06.80
with Chris knew, who is a little bit different than the Chris Kyle that's often portrayed

437
00:31:06.80 --> 00:31:07.80
in the movies.

438
00:31:07.80 --> 00:31:10.36
For sure, I'd be happy to talk about that.

439
00:31:10.36 --> 00:31:16.000
And it's funny because people want people to tell Chris Kyle's doors, you know, and

440
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.44
he really is the legend, which I think a lot of people don't realize it was a name that

441
00:31:20.44 --> 00:31:21.44
was given to him.

442
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:26.60
You know, that was his nickname was the legend, it was given to him and his previous

443
00:31:26.60 --> 00:31:28.76
14 before we worked together.

444
00:31:28.76 --> 00:31:32.32
And I remember our met Chris at that time because I was with SILTEEN 5 and I deployed at the

445
00:31:32.32 --> 00:31:35.68
same time under the EASY of SILTEEN 3.

446
00:31:35.68 --> 00:31:38.92
And so we were there and I remember meeting him in the talk and just come back from Felugia

447
00:31:38.92 --> 00:31:45.32
and doing some great sniper work there and working with a bunch of our mutual friends.

448
00:31:45.32 --> 00:31:51.20
And so his return was in the Pacific theater at the time and he got a chance to go forward

449
00:31:51.20 --> 00:31:55.48
and be one of the few guys from the guys that were going to the Pacific that were selected

450
00:31:55.48 --> 00:31:59.36
to go to Iraq and actually be in the fight.

451
00:31:59.36 --> 00:32:02.000
And so guys were pissed.

452
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.24
They were pissed that they were sitting there and the Pacific theater trained in some local

453
00:32:07.24 --> 00:32:11.24
national forces out of shoot around on paper and Chris was over there shooting bad guys

454
00:32:11.24 --> 00:32:12.24
in Iraq.

455
00:32:12.24 --> 00:32:18.60
And so they made this nickname the legend which was, and it was very much ingest.

456
00:32:18.60 --> 00:32:24.76
So it's funny that as he continued to go on and do these great things and now he's just

457
00:32:24.76 --> 00:32:27.76
this incredible larger life theater he really is the legend.

458
00:32:27.76 --> 00:32:32.28
And it's really, so when I hear stories or watch movies or hear people talk about it

459
00:32:32.28 --> 00:32:33.80
away it's, it is.

460
00:32:33.80 --> 00:32:35.44
It's not the Chris Calde we knew.

461
00:32:35.44 --> 00:32:37.52
It's a superhuman.

462
00:32:37.52 --> 00:32:43.68
It's like a comic book hero and look at the reality is I think you know, I haven't worked

463
00:32:43.68 --> 00:32:48.16
really close with Chris and he was our lead sniper and point man just so people understand

464
00:32:48.16 --> 00:32:53.68
that in Charlie Baton I was the Baton commander of Charlie Baton which meant that on every

465
00:32:53.68 --> 00:32:59.80
patrol that we went on he was walking about eight or ten feet in front of me and that

466
00:32:59.80 --> 00:33:02.72
we talked all the time.

467
00:33:02.72 --> 00:33:08.76
We were in working about where we were going in, working together and what areas we wanted

468
00:33:08.76 --> 00:33:12.28
to take down, what buildings we wanted to utilize.

469
00:33:12.28 --> 00:33:18.12
And he was a guy that really drove a lot of our operations and so I knew Chris well.

470
00:33:18.12 --> 00:33:26.64
He was one of the three guys we had three guys that were on their third built-in and we

471
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:30.52
called them the Triumvirate and these two other guys, she'll act of duty, I can't name

472
00:33:30.52 --> 00:33:34.32
them, they're outstanding guys but these guys have been together for three built-in three

473
00:33:34.32 --> 00:33:41.68
rotations through to the police, the middle east to Iraq and so we called them the Triumvirate

474
00:33:41.68 --> 00:33:46.08
you know which is the Triumvirate is a term from the Roman era where you had a group of

475
00:33:46.08 --> 00:33:50.72
three people who share a position of power to authority and these guys really drove they

476
00:33:50.72 --> 00:33:56.24
really they brought up the new guys, they trained new guys and got our opportunity really

477
00:33:56.24 --> 00:33:59.92
where they needed to be, we're kind of the heart and soul of the Baton and Chris was you

478
00:33:59.92 --> 00:34:05.76
know the real Chris that we knew and worked with was hilarious number one and you know

479
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:09.40
that doesn't come across when you when you to a lot of people that he was a guy who's

480
00:34:09.40 --> 00:34:14.56
just funny is hell always could crack a joke sometimes when he shouldn't have been

481
00:34:14.56 --> 00:34:21.76
cracking the joke yeah but he was a guy that you know I think it almost does him

482
00:34:21.76 --> 00:34:27.12
a disservice to pain him in a way that was this superhuman because the reason he was so

483
00:34:27.12 --> 00:34:31.68
successful at what he did is that he worked really hard at that and was very focused

484
00:34:31.68 --> 00:34:36.92
on it to really perfect his craft and he you know not only that he he delved into the

485
00:34:36.92 --> 00:34:41.60
planning so we'd sit over a map and talk about where we wanted to go look at different

486
00:34:41.60 --> 00:34:48.64
buildings and say and then we go on a reconnaissance patrol which we had to run up through

487
00:34:48.64 --> 00:34:53.92
approval to the chain of command for certain types of operations but Jaco is our

488
00:34:53.92 --> 00:35:00.16
task in a manner approved our our reconnaissance patrols and meaning meaning that I could

489
00:35:00.16 --> 00:35:03.76
approve them so they didn't really have to go up that that chain of command so it's pretty

490
00:35:03.76 --> 00:35:07.68
easy to get them approved for people that are listening didn't quite catch that yeah

491
00:35:07.68 --> 00:35:13.28
so yeah so we just said hey Jaco we want to do this and he'd be like great so we go

492
00:35:13.28 --> 00:35:18.48
we'd go out and we patrol through some really bad areas and we'd hit like a dozen

493
00:35:18.48 --> 00:35:22.64
different buildings going buildings here check out observation points there see what kind of

494
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:27.68
you know roads we could see in access so we could see so we figure out what gave us

495
00:35:27.68 --> 00:35:31.68
the best advantage and then Chris would figure out where he wanted to be and he'd put

496
00:35:31.68 --> 00:35:35.44
himself in that position and so he'd get I'm looking down this window I'm looking through

497
00:35:35.44 --> 00:35:42.08
this loophole and the roof wall and you know he so he said himself up success which is awesome

498
00:35:42.08 --> 00:35:46.96
which is so up maybe so for instance if the angle that he would pick from a building

499
00:35:46.96 --> 00:35:52.64
would be looking down the long access of a road where he could see four five hundred meters

500
00:35:52.64 --> 00:35:58.80
worth of possible enemy targets whereas another angle looking down a shorter road maybe you can

501
00:35:58.80 --> 00:36:04.40
only see 80 meters and he got a much smaller area to cover so he'd pick these areas that he thought

502
00:36:04.40 --> 00:36:10.08
would be the most prevalent most no the highest number of targets possible of course and

503
00:36:10.08 --> 00:36:16.96
and but that was obviously that was how we made the that's how we made the that's how we were

504
00:36:16.96 --> 00:36:21.92
so successful and that's how we were able to to prevent attacks on enemy forces and are on

505
00:36:21.92 --> 00:36:27.68
enemy attacks on friendly forces rather and and so you know not only that but when we go into

506
00:36:27.68 --> 00:36:32.32
these these positions you know Chris would be he knew after the sun came up first call the

507
00:36:32.32 --> 00:36:36.48
prayer goes down and the kind of early dawn pre-done hours and then the sun comes up and the

508
00:36:36.48 --> 00:36:41.76
city comes alive and enemy fighters are moving around and you know he'd be on the on the weapon

509
00:36:41.76 --> 00:36:48.80
when he knew that was looking down his cypresscope when he knew it was it was that was the highest

510
00:36:48.80 --> 00:36:53.36
in the early morning you know as the morning comes around you know that 80 10 o'clock hour

511
00:36:53.36 --> 00:36:57.68
that's when we knew we were going to get contacted and you know late afternoon was kind of the same thing

512
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:03.36
he'd be honest is gun and of course he had to rotate out at some point he could so you're only

513
00:37:03.36 --> 00:37:10.40
humanly possible this day when you're gun for so long but when he was honest gun he looked down

514
00:37:10.40 --> 00:37:14.72
the scope of the weapon I mean he was very disciplined about that and I remember hearing some

515
00:37:14.72 --> 00:37:20.32
other guys being like oh man you know I only have I only have eight or ten kilos and Chris you know

516
00:37:20.32 --> 00:37:25.84
how has he got 85 now you know some some you know so at some point through into our deployment

517
00:37:25.84 --> 00:37:30.56
before it was completed and you know the route as you can see some of those guys were

518
00:37:31.60 --> 00:37:34.88
you know we had seven other cypressine on both and they did a lot of great work and they did

519
00:37:34.88 --> 00:37:39.44
they had some impact and certainly did great stuff but a couple of those guys I'd see that

520
00:37:40.08 --> 00:37:43.60
didn't have the same discipline Chris that they would they'd look down their weapon and you

521
00:37:43.60 --> 00:37:47.84
30 45 minutes into it they're not as you know they're not seeing anything they haven't

522
00:37:47.84 --> 00:37:52.16
firing his shots and Xenoe they're kind of having a conversation with their buddy next to him

523
00:37:52.16 --> 00:37:55.76
next to you know they're sitting back from there they're rifle next to you know they're just

524
00:37:55.76 --> 00:37:59.92
kind of looking through binos and I remember watching Chris and just he's just looking through

525
00:37:59.92 --> 00:38:04.88
his scope for two straight hours and without coming off of it and it was you know that was that

526
00:38:04.88 --> 00:38:10.32
enabled him to be successful and that discipline really paid off and certainly certainly he was

527
00:38:10.32 --> 00:38:16.32
able to rack up the the damage to enemy fighters no doubt about it I know whenever I roll out to

528
00:38:16.32 --> 00:38:21.04
visit you guys and it over watch position see everyone and I would always notice Chris will always

529
00:38:21.04 --> 00:38:25.44
be on a gun but I'd never saw him not on his gun of course obviously like he said he's

530
00:38:25.44 --> 00:38:30.08
human and he'd take breaks but I I'd I'd notice that even on the planet you know I'd just say

531
00:38:30.08 --> 00:38:34.88
oh Chris is on his gun except for when you ruled in the cop falcon and he was crashed out

532
00:38:34.88 --> 00:38:41.92
sleeping with the rest of you guys so that was actually kind of a funny episode where we went in on boats

533
00:38:41.92 --> 00:38:49.92
and we snuck into we snuck down this is some Chris wrote about in American sniper we we went

534
00:38:49.92 --> 00:38:54.72
out on the the Marine Corps boat unit that was there was a great group of guys to the awesome

535
00:38:54.72 --> 00:39:00.80
guys and they they took his very quietly down at the river canal that kind of comes off of the

536
00:39:00.80 --> 00:39:06.16
river we were able to to launch off on the river bank very quietly foot patrol into the city

537
00:39:06.16 --> 00:39:11.68
and and get in an area that other people couldn't get into a super dangerous bad guys had no idea

538
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:16.96
where they're and we were able to take advantage of that smoke who smoke a guy are to on the way in

539
00:39:16.96 --> 00:39:21.52
and then and then moving and take down the buildings that were gonna be this combat outpost as

540
00:39:21.52 --> 00:39:27.20
the army they were falling this giant mine clearance element coming down the roads digging

541
00:39:27.20 --> 00:39:33.04
ideas. Jockel was riding in in a Bradley fighting vehicle brave in the the some of the

542
00:39:33.04 --> 00:39:38.56
most dangerous roads in the world the time you know coming in with the the army battalion staff there

543
00:39:38.56 --> 00:39:42.56
and as our command and control and so we were already in we'd been there for I don't know

544
00:39:42.56 --> 00:39:48.08
three or four hours at that point maybe maybe longer and so we shot a couple guys and we're you know

545
00:39:48.08 --> 00:39:52.88
we're a couple enemy fighters and and we still had guys in security position certainly in guys

546
00:39:52.88 --> 00:39:57.84
on guns but at that point it was the I.D. Clarence team was like right underneath us I remember

547
00:39:57.84 --> 00:40:05.60
actually looking over the side of the building and seeing this giant buffalo is huge truck armored

548
00:40:05.60 --> 00:40:10.88
vehicle with a arm on it digging out of the street and I know you were in a vehicle kind of coming

549
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:16.08
and just behind that a few few vehicles up the road you were maybe a few blocks away at that

550
00:40:16.08 --> 00:40:23.28
point and I'm looking down I'm like that's like 30 feet below me like directly below me right now

551
00:40:23.28 --> 00:40:28.48
so if this thing activates an ID that explodes like I'm gonna take it right to face probably

552
00:40:28.48 --> 00:40:32.24
I'd get up down and stop looking at what they're doing so we were just kind of hooked her down

553
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:37.68
and when Jockel came in there it was it was fun because the the in particular the army

554
00:40:37.68 --> 00:40:42.16
operations officer for the battalion was a great guy and the battalion was awesome this was

555
00:40:42.16 --> 00:40:48.40
task force banded a bunch of tankers great guys we loved them they came in and and I remember

556
00:40:48.40 --> 00:40:53.52
you come to the rooftop with a major and he comes up there and he's expecting just bristling weapons

557
00:40:53.52 --> 00:40:58.40
everywhere at all seals on their guns and I'm looking over as the major stand in there and kind of

558
00:40:58.40 --> 00:41:02.48
looking around and there's a couple guys on there guns and there's some guys on machine guns

559
00:41:02.48 --> 00:41:07.12
and people watching this day security was definitely security was set of course but I'm looking

560
00:41:07.12 --> 00:41:14.48
over and Chris and our leading petty officer had just hammered down these like chef boy R.D.

561
00:41:15.28 --> 00:41:20.88
didn't want to eat MR.E. so they just crushed these like he had like three or four empty containers

562
00:41:20.88 --> 00:41:26.96
of like chef boy R.D. meatballs like who pleats like yeah it was just like like spilled all

563
00:41:26.96 --> 00:41:31.52
over as uniform and he's just like totally racked out like completely asleep

564
00:41:31.52 --> 00:41:40.000
slumber himself snoring and the major is like is this man who did it? it's funny because we

565
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.20
would get the preparation for those big operations you'd be working so much doing the preparation

566
00:41:45.20 --> 00:41:50.72
of the coordination and the planning that you wouldn't even stop for a day and a half or two days

567
00:41:50.72 --> 00:41:55.76
and when you finally get in the field you're tired exactly and we we had to sleep and that's

568
00:41:55.76 --> 00:41:59.52
when we had to sleep when we knew we'd kill some bad guys we weren't going to get attacked or

569
00:41:59.52 --> 00:42:04.32
we less likely to get attacked in the next few hours while it was still dark we had to get sleep

570
00:42:04.32 --> 00:42:08.80
then and so there was a real reason for that because once the sun came up we were going to get hammered

571
00:42:08.80 --> 00:42:12.88
so we all had to be awake we all had to be ready to go so we had to get that kind of sleep when we

572
00:42:12.88 --> 00:42:17.84
could and that was you know that particular operation I remember in particular Chris

573
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:23.68
he was he just kind of had a good sense about things we were arguing over a bill I was

574
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:27.36
standing on the rooftop and I was okay there's a bill meet there's a big bill into the south

575
00:42:27.36 --> 00:42:31.28
that would give us a good vantage point let's move down what do you think about that

576
00:42:31.28 --> 00:42:35.68
building over there I'm talking it over with him and with our potential chief Tony and Chris was like

577
00:42:35.68 --> 00:42:40.32
you know what I like this building to the east let's go to the forest story yeah he's pulling a

578
00:42:40.32 --> 00:42:43.92
forest story and I was like I don't know man that building the south looks pretty good he's like

579
00:42:44.48 --> 00:42:50.64
I think this building the east is where we want to go and we talked about it for a little bit

580
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:55.28
and I was like okay Roger that let's go to the east so we moved we moved about 350 yards down

581
00:42:55.28 --> 00:43:00.48
the street to this big forest story apartment building and it was it was absolutely the right call

582
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:06.16
I mean and we not done that we would have because it was I think we had what do we have like 22

583
00:43:06.16 --> 00:43:11.12
enemy confirmed kill from that over the 40 years or I really was right but a couple of dozen you

584
00:43:11.12 --> 00:43:16.64
know probable kill so it was it was it was a great advantage point and we were looking right

585
00:43:16.64 --> 00:43:23.36
down a long access road that was able to prevent a whole bunch of attacks on the U.S. soldiers

586
00:43:23.36 --> 00:43:27.20
that were building that combat outpost and it was and they were under fire the whole time and as soon

587
00:43:27.20 --> 00:43:32.64
as the sun came up I know you were sitting in the camp with those mortars came in and you know and

588
00:43:32.64 --> 00:43:38.56
then lo and behold so this the mortars explode in the camp and we you know it's easy to just say

589
00:43:38.56 --> 00:43:45.84
oh mortars but the reality was a gigantic explosion goes off and we were 350 yards away

590
00:43:46.40 --> 00:43:52.80
frag was raining down fragmentation from that explosion was raining down on us from 350 yards away

591
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:59.12
so it was massive 120 millimeter mortars coming in you know enforce a kill the soldier will

592
00:43:59.12 --> 00:44:04.56
go to a couple others and and that very I mean within about half an hour of that Chris

593
00:44:04.56 --> 00:44:10.56
smoked two guys out of like four that were low in a mortar tube in the back of a truck so

594
00:44:10.56 --> 00:44:15.76
and when when that's that's who Chris was and that's that's the impact that he had and yet a

595
00:44:15.76 --> 00:44:20.96
good sense about what what where to go and what to do and he was excellent at it and he was just

596
00:44:20.96 --> 00:44:26.80
it was just awesome to work with him he was so much fun to be around and always quick with a joke

597
00:44:26.80 --> 00:44:35.68
and that's the real Chris got when it you know to just go back to the fact that he you know after

598
00:44:35.68 --> 00:44:39.68
you know I was on I was in the combat outpost we take these mortars soldier gets killed I remember

599
00:44:39.68 --> 00:44:45.12
there and another soldier got wounded I think and a rack he got wounded as well and it's it's a nightmare

600
00:44:45.12 --> 00:44:52.000
right these guys are bleeding out it's it's a nightmare and the thing and we talked about this

601
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.52
on the last podcast of how helpless you feel against mortars it's the worst and talking about

602
00:44:57.52 --> 00:45:01.68
it because they came from maybe they could have come from three four five kilometers away

603
00:45:01.68 --> 00:45:05.92
and Eugene sledge talks about it and we talked about World War One and how bad it is and so you

604
00:45:05.92 --> 00:45:12.32
have this combat outpost and all the guys are on their their now horrified right your scared

605
00:45:12.32 --> 00:45:18.16
when is this next random bomb gonna just blow up we cannot be safe if you can imagine

606
00:45:19.04 --> 00:45:24.88
the when I got word from you hey Chris just killed two guys with a mortar tube and I went to

607
00:45:24.88 --> 00:45:28.96
you know the company commander and the brigade commander was down there as well and said hey sir

608
00:45:29.60 --> 00:45:33.60
one of our snipers just killed two guys with a mortar tube loaded into a truck

609
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:40.80
you couldn't do anything in the world better for them at that time nothing better in the world

610
00:45:40.80 --> 00:45:45.44
to walk into those guys and say hey you just lost a soldier to mortar we got him

611
00:45:46.16 --> 00:45:51.28
and that was one of those things that just helped build our relationship with the conventional

612
00:45:51.28 --> 00:45:56.96
unit so much and you know what we needed the relationship because you could sit here and tell

613
00:45:56.96 --> 00:46:02.96
stories all day long about what they did and returned for us which was also just incredibly

614
00:46:03.68 --> 00:46:09.76
brave and that we very same day we were calling QRF and I know you were you were trying to move

615
00:46:09.76 --> 00:46:13.44
vehicles out of the way so we could get the tanks out there to our guys that were pinned down

616
00:46:13.44 --> 00:46:18.48
and needed help and those tankers came out every time the soldier for amazing you know when

617
00:46:18.48 --> 00:46:23.60
they when Chris Kyle got those two guys hot like how far away is that typically

618
00:46:24.16 --> 00:46:28.16
or is there even a little before right that's you have to do with people talking about these

619
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:34.80
sniper elements well first of all they have to understand that it's in Ramadi in downtown Ramadi in 2006

620
00:46:34.80 --> 00:46:41.36
this was this was like Stalin grad I mean it was just rubble pile buildings just we had this was

621
00:46:41.36 --> 00:46:47.04
alkydden Iraq battle space I mean this is the precursor of ISIS and it's the same people and they

622
00:46:47.04 --> 00:46:53.04
there were several thousand of these guys that controlled the city and it was it was just a nasty

623
00:46:53.04 --> 00:46:58.32
place so we didn't go out in these little two and four man teams it was we were going in with

624
00:46:58.32 --> 00:47:05.36
15 20 25 30 guys you know sometimes we have to manage just 40 guys you're plus up with army and

625
00:47:05.36 --> 00:47:09.84
Marines that went in with us and we always had Iraqi soldiers what we didn't count them as part of

626
00:47:09.84 --> 00:47:14.24
our this part of our these are the guys going to help build this out if you think you go down so we

627
00:47:14.24 --> 00:47:18.64
had to have a big enough element that could get prevent us from being overrun and you know if Chris

628
00:47:18.64 --> 00:47:23.68
were here today I think he'd tell you man is you know the the only reason he was able to do what he

629
00:47:23.68 --> 00:47:27.68
what he could was because there was a huge team of guys supporting and those the guys

630
00:47:27.68 --> 00:47:33.44
care and the machine guns in that were helping beat back attacks and guess what when you're attacked

631
00:47:33.44 --> 00:47:39.28
by machine guns and and rockets from RPGs and and you got a dozen enemy fighters maneuvering on you

632
00:47:39.76 --> 00:47:45.28
you're not breaking contact with a bolt action sample shot snagged you got to have those

633
00:47:45.28 --> 00:47:48.72
machine gunners that are going to beat back those attacks and that's what those guys did so you know

634
00:47:48.72 --> 00:47:53.28
without without without that whole team we we were carrying our own shoulder fire rock it's our

635
00:47:53.28 --> 00:47:59.12
leading peddaus or it was always a guy that would carry the carry that big heavy 84 millimeter

636
00:47:59.12 --> 00:48:04.24
recoil is rifle over shoulder this big bazooka looking thing and and the heavy rounds for that

637
00:48:04.24 --> 00:48:09.76
it was it was we had to have that kind of firepower with us so that was critical for all that we did

638
00:48:09.76 --> 00:48:15.44
but most of the shots were pretty close I mean you're talking urban combat is you know there

639
00:48:15.44 --> 00:48:21.04
wasn't a lot of real long range shooting ever once a while they I think I think Chris and Tony

640
00:48:21.04 --> 00:48:26.32
he had a couple guys from 1500 yards or so out in a rule there I went on that particular operation

641
00:48:26.32 --> 00:48:32.72
but but there was but most of the stuff in the urban environment of downtown I mean we we hit

642
00:48:32.72 --> 00:48:39.52
guys from as close as I remember a couple of times were one time a particular me and markly

643
00:48:39.52 --> 00:48:46.96
and and Chris were sitting in a room and we look over and there's some guys like there's

644
00:48:46.96 --> 00:48:52.80
literally some moves like some enemy fighters with machine guns looking around the corner and

645
00:48:52.80 --> 00:48:57.76
they're like they're like 25 yards from this like like you know maybe 30 yards from this

646
00:48:58.32 --> 00:49:01.28
and they're they're looking down the street they knew we were in there somewhere but they got the

647
00:49:01.28 --> 00:49:07.52
building wrong so so you're you're talking a 30 yard shot there with that that's where guys coming

648
00:49:07.52 --> 00:49:12.80
on you know I think Chris ditched his right is his sniper rifle grab his info and shot those

649
00:49:12.80 --> 00:49:17.52
guys through the window and then you know some of those shots are making a lot of them I think

650
00:49:17.52 --> 00:49:25.60
the average was I would say probably anywhere from 100 to 300 300 and that's you call that

651
00:49:25.60 --> 00:49:30.32
pretty close like it's pretty close for 100 for sure for sure for sure these guys in their

652
00:49:30.32 --> 00:49:35.84
train to make you know 1,200,000 yards shots and so it's it's just a very different type of

653
00:49:35.84 --> 00:49:40.80
environment and that urban combat is it's personal you can hear those guys yelling at you you can

654
00:49:40.80 --> 00:49:45.28
hear me yelling the jahadi regret we're yelling back at them you know there's there's a lot of

655
00:49:45.28 --> 00:49:50.48
profanity going back and forth and but it's you know some of the stuff was anger-nade range

656
00:49:50.48 --> 00:49:56.32
definitely dang and call them what moves that we call them moves moves that's that's that's

657
00:49:56.32 --> 00:50:02.32
that was what the quality fighters that we so they call themselves Mujahideen which is

658
00:50:02.32 --> 00:50:08.48
God so in gauge in jihad that's their name for themselves and so we shot that to move

659
00:50:08.48 --> 00:50:14.08
and we actually got told that we weren't supposed to call the mouche. Yeah it's interesting

660
00:50:14.08 --> 00:50:20.40
you can take a real name short knit and it becomes derogatory. Yeah it was the interesting thing

661
00:50:20.40 --> 00:50:28.32
was we were told that it was derogatory and inappropriate to say mouche and that it was disrespected

662
00:50:28.32 --> 00:50:32.88
to the local populace and when we talked to the local populace you know what the local populace

663
00:50:32.88 --> 00:50:39.68
called the mouche. That's what they called them. It was funny we had the cultural experts

664
00:50:39.68 --> 00:50:44.96
telling us when we were actually we were talking to locals and understanding what was happening

665
00:50:44.96 --> 00:50:49.76
more than anybody else at that particular time. Yeah maybe it was like offensive to them though you

666
00:50:49.76 --> 00:50:55.28
know the actual mouche. Maybe they were offended. We were not concerned about offended mouche.

667
00:50:55.28 --> 00:50:58.88
Yeah and you're all shooting them you're shooting them but the mouche that's too much

668
00:50:58.88 --> 00:51:04.80
another channel with that big culture warriors who just don't get it. Yeah it was a local

669
00:51:04.80 --> 00:51:10.80
people were praying for us to go killed them. Yeah killed the bad guys and then free them from this

670
00:51:10.80 --> 00:51:17.84
evil terrorist organization that is imposing this horrific just brutal rain of terror on them and

671
00:51:17.84 --> 00:51:21.92
so I mean it's exactly the same thing you see ISIS doing today and we saw it over and over again

672
00:51:21.92 --> 00:51:25.60
in the city where you you know you go into a house and there's a family there and they're trying

673
00:51:25.60 --> 00:51:30.16
to just not to get killed in the crossfire and they want your help and they're happy you're there.

674
00:51:32.16 --> 00:51:38.64
You know you mentioned Mark and Mark was in the movie Mark Lee he was in the movie

675
00:51:38.64 --> 00:51:47.36
American Snipers well and again there's something that comes across in the public image or

676
00:51:47.36 --> 00:51:51.60
the image that gets created through Hollywood and through books and through media and whatever else

677
00:51:51.60 --> 00:51:58.64
and they really in the movie American Snipers they really miss the mark with Mark I mean they

678
00:51:58.64 --> 00:52:06.88
really they really missed the mark no doubt made him into kind of a weak looking guy that didn't

679
00:52:06.88 --> 00:52:13.52
believe anyone he was doing which was obviously couldn't be further from the truth. Well to that

680
00:52:13.52 --> 00:52:17.68
point I would we get asked all the time like you know tell us about American Snipers was that accurate

681
00:52:17.68 --> 00:52:24.96
you know I think I think it's important to say that first of all I'm I'm very glad that Chris

682
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:31.68
Kyle stores out there and I think that to get people to recognize what Chris did and you know the

683
00:52:31.68 --> 00:52:39.04
impact that he had and the fact that his his story is representative of so many hundreds of

684
00:52:39.04 --> 00:52:45.44
thousands of U.S. soldiers and Marines and sailors who at airmen that have deployed multiple times

685
00:52:45.44 --> 00:52:51.20
what their families go through and I think that's a great thing but it's it is a Hollywood movie

686
00:52:51.20 --> 00:52:58.16
and and so you know the the scenes in Iraq were not a reflection of the reality that we knew

687
00:52:59.28 --> 00:53:05.28
and in particular that depiction of Mark that's what disturbed those of us that serve closely

688
00:53:05.28 --> 00:53:08.80
with Chris and close to with Mark were most disturbed by that and it was just the way that

689
00:53:08.80 --> 00:53:16.08
Mark was portrayed you know Hollywood has they hate the Iraq war so they've got to they got to have

690
00:53:16.08 --> 00:53:21.20
someone in there that doesn't like the Iraq war and so they they tried they betrayed Mark in a way

691
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.40
that you know he made some despair they got they got him saying I don't even remember exactly what

692
00:53:26.40 --> 00:53:31.52
what he says but he says some lines about he doesn't believe in what he's doing and that is just

693
00:53:31.52 --> 00:53:39.92
utter and complete horseshit I mean there's no Markly believed in that mission I mean he was

694
00:53:39.92 --> 00:53:46.56
he was an extraordinary warrior and you know other when other people were out to kill bad guys

695
00:53:46.56 --> 00:53:51.28
and try to you know do a bunch of operations I mean Mark truly believe we were there to help the

696
00:53:51.28 --> 00:53:56.08
Iraqi people we need to free these people from this brutal rain of terror and I think he had a

697
00:53:56.08 --> 00:54:03.44
he had strategic insight that I'm not even sure I had I mean I read back like Mark's last letter home

698
00:54:03.84 --> 00:54:09.92
and he talks about being involved in a great conflict and a great struggle you know he had

699
00:54:09.92 --> 00:54:14.72
like the one we're involved and and it's I think that was very reflective of that this is this

700
00:54:16.32 --> 00:54:22.24
seeing that you know the enemy that we're fighting here this this type of G-hode you know this G-hodeism

701
00:54:22.24 --> 00:54:27.52
with this this strain of Islam that exports G-hode across the world and and once it goes out and terrorize

702
00:54:27.52 --> 00:54:32.32
and brutalize people like this is a great struggle this is going to be a generational struggle this is

703
00:54:32.32 --> 00:54:37.60
going to go on for a long time it's certainly transcends Iraq and I think he had he really

704
00:54:37.60 --> 00:54:43.12
seemed to sense that in a way that was pretty phenomenal in the movie is they they make him out to be

705
00:54:43.12 --> 00:54:50.24
this sad guy that's all serious and again they completely miss the mark just like they they portray

706
00:54:50.24 --> 00:54:59.28
Chris to be this ultra serious guy Mark was hilarious, grigarius, another guy that was joking

707
00:54:59.28 --> 00:55:06.24
all the time mostly at inappropriate times and had that you know he would just he would

708
00:55:06.24 --> 00:55:12.32
light up a room when he'd come in to a room because he was just on fire and to portray him as this

709
00:55:12.32 --> 00:55:19.12
guy that's all down in the dumps and depressed it was just it was horrible to see that it was it was just

710
00:55:19.12 --> 00:55:25.04
so opposite of the real mark I mean this is the brooding guy and and the head of miss this kind of

711
00:55:25.04 --> 00:55:32.80
like pencil neck kind of you know is the quote patent couldn't fight his way out of a piss soaked paper back

712
00:55:32.80 --> 00:55:38.96
I mean Mark was a badass guy he had massive arms he carried his his big heavy

713
00:55:38.96 --> 00:55:44.32
Mark 48 machine gun that weighs like 25 27 pounds fully loaded with all the gadgets on it

714
00:55:44.32 --> 00:55:50.16
it would no sling he cared his shoulder like it was a little him for rifle you know that weighs

715
00:55:50.16 --> 00:55:56.32
seven pounds I'm gonna air you know with all that's it's gadgetry he's he was a just an awesome

716
00:55:56.32 --> 00:56:01.20
warrior and and yeah that's side of him that was just hilarious it was so many stories of him

717
00:56:01.20 --> 00:56:06.72
cracking jokes and just keeping everybody laughing and we kind of talked to if you if you're listening

718
00:56:06.72 --> 00:56:12.48
to podcast and you haven't seen a series called on the history channel called Live To Tell it is a

719
00:56:12.48 --> 00:56:20.48
fantastic series that actually a former seal friend of ours Raymond doze produced he did he produce

720
00:56:20.48 --> 00:56:25.12
he was in Ramadi actually and he relieved us in Ramadi when we got done with our deployment

721
00:56:25.12 --> 00:56:30.56
Ramadi he's one of the guys that came in the next task unit that came over and took our place

722
00:56:30.56 --> 00:56:37.44
and he worked out a camp carigador that's right we just spoke about so they made an episode one of

723
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:44.88
the episodes is about chargoth patoon mark lee and we we got to tell some of the stories there but

724
00:56:44.88 --> 00:56:49.84
you know they're you don't have that you can't tell every story that you want to tell you want to tell

725
00:56:49.84 --> 00:56:54.96
every story every little member you have of these guys you know one that always sticks out my mind

726
00:56:54.96 --> 00:57:02.32
because he joined your patoon late and he came from another patoon came into your patoon after work

727
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:07.92
up and one of the first trips we did with him was to was to Vegas and we went up there to work

728
00:57:07.92 --> 00:57:12.000
yeah what's there to tell us that was there for us now we've been working now as any of our

729
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.56
soon dog will trip that whole boom dog will we would work from probably about noon until

730
00:57:18.56 --> 00:57:24.000
let's call it six or seven o'clock at night and then everyone would go gambling and drinking

731
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.76
and partying until 10 o'clock the next morning and then gamble it was just one of those trips

732
00:57:31.76 --> 00:57:36.88
but but we we we we were we were getting after it and that's another thing about being a young

733
00:57:36.88 --> 00:57:43.84
seal you don't have you don't have you don't you don't owe any money right so you just when I

734
00:57:43.84 --> 00:57:48.32
remember when I was a young seal I was like the richest guy in the world because you know you go

735
00:57:48.32 --> 00:57:53.84
from being a civilian that's 18 years old making no money and all of a sudden you're getting a paycheck

736
00:57:53.84 --> 00:57:57.28
and then you get the seal teams you're getting dive pay and jump pay and demolish and pay and

737
00:57:57.28 --> 00:58:01.52
you're like the richest guy in the world you're like a rock star and that's kind of the mode

738
00:58:01.52 --> 00:58:06.40
that Mark was there night I would we were in Vegas was he was big time in it to get after it

739
00:58:07.04 --> 00:58:11.60
I remember you on that trail I'm gonna you coming in and say HDH are you with

740
00:58:12.88 --> 00:58:19.68
I was like I was like what is HDH like are you with you just after I said Roger that I'm in

741
00:58:20.32 --> 00:58:26.000
I did that with a bunch of guys HDH who's in and I went and I'm guys like I'm in I'm in no one

742
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.40
even knew what I was talking about and then I at whatever we got together that night I'm like

743
00:58:30.40 --> 00:58:34.96
all right HDH who's with me and the everyone joined up I said it's $100 hands we're going to

744
00:58:34.96 --> 00:58:42.16
blackjack table we're all gonna play $3100 hands which to those guys and our Navy paychecks it was a big

745
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:50.24
deal yeah so we did it but the plan gambling with Mark was was insane because he was so

746
00:58:51.52 --> 00:58:57.76
so like hostile and yet at the same time fun and I remember I came walking down to the casino

747
00:58:57.76 --> 00:59:04.24
and he's like hey sir and I look over and he's across the casino and he's at the blackjack

748
00:59:04.24 --> 00:59:09.44
table and he goes he must have been on a wooden street he goes where are the new Cadillacs coming out

749
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.88
and that was just so so him just to be fired up like that was just awesome awesome he was just one of

750
00:59:18.88 --> 00:59:24.88
those guys and you know not only was he hilarious to be around you know a big strap and good

751
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.36
looking dude he he he just was very comfortable in his skin as well you know and he he he

752
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:35.84
uh he was absolutely in love with it as wife you know my I was in that in in Liffa tell and

753
00:59:36.72 --> 00:59:44.40
he she had given him this these uh I mean he's these little pajama pants I mean this is like

754
00:59:44.40 --> 00:59:49.44
and he he would wear them around the camp yeah these pajama pants and I was like bro

755
00:59:49.44 --> 00:59:56.08
what are you wearing pajama pants right now and he went yeah I was like why are you wearing I mean

756
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:01.68
he's a new guy in a potato joke don't let jocos you I was like do you want to get you ask it like

757
01:00:01.68 --> 01:00:06.48
why are you wearing a pajama and she's like they're comfortable my again doing like a

758
01:00:06.48 --> 01:00:11.92
I mean he's like he just did like whatever you know like a muggares so that was just the way Mark was

759
01:00:11.92 --> 01:00:17.36
and you know he just was uh I remember a particular you know not he was he was a strong Christian guy

760
01:00:17.36 --> 01:00:23.84
definitely uh he'd gone to seminary for about a year or so I think you know to study to be a

761
01:00:23.84 --> 01:00:28.72
preacher and decided you know what instead of being a preacher I want to be in the sea

762
01:00:28.72 --> 01:00:33.36
of things but his Christian faith was certainly always a big big piece of that and I remember

763
01:00:33.36 --> 01:00:38.32
some of the most random things we were talking about uh I don't even remember how it came up

764
01:00:38.32 --> 01:00:46.000
but if you remember the old 1980 song of the warrior which is like cheeseball 1980s

765
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.80
you know and we got an argument about who sang the warrior and Mark was like it's pat been a

766
01:00:52.80 --> 01:01:00.000
tar and I'm embarrassed to say that I said no it's patty smith because I had this guy

767
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.52
you don't do it myth that right this gigantic collection of you know it he saw you

768
01:01:03.52 --> 01:01:09.68
a vaginal my uh on my iTunes and and and so we argued about it we had some weight I

769
01:01:09.68 --> 01:01:15.68
remember where the wager was but it was uh in fact patty smith that was right right on

770
01:01:15.68 --> 01:01:21.52
and I think that you know you talked about his faith and and we've talked about on this

771
01:01:21.52 --> 01:01:33.12
on this podcast before the when you get somebody that is is heroic that oftentimes

772
01:01:33.12 --> 01:01:42.08
they have a certain sense of the word that you just use was comfort and you could see

773
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:49.68
that with Mark that he was comfortable in the fact that he might have to make the ultimate

774
01:01:49.68 --> 01:01:56.48
sacrifice and I remember one of the one of the things I'll never forget about Mark is

775
01:01:56.48 --> 01:02:03.60
as you guys would be rolling out on an operation and you would line up the vehicles right

776
01:02:03.60 --> 01:02:09.44
in front of the chow hall on our on our little base shark base and you know if you guys were

777
01:02:09.44 --> 01:02:14.72
going out I would go out there to see you guys off and just to help her by understand like we're

778
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:20.24
rolling out on an operation into some of the most dangerous enemy territory anywhere and

779
01:02:20.24 --> 01:02:26.16
and people would come out with jocco and our from our task and shake shake folks hands up

780
01:02:26.16 --> 01:02:30.88
because you knew that it could very easily happen to not everybody's coming back from from that

781
01:02:30.88 --> 01:02:36.16
off and you always it was always reassuring to see jocco out there talking to people shaking

782
01:02:36.16 --> 01:02:40.24
people's hands and that was and we're going out particularly in our operation like that were

783
01:02:41.68 --> 01:02:48.000
IEDs are calling causing catastrophic damage and killing soldiers and Marines every single day

784
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:56.72
yeah and those IEDs at this point were generally victim activated IEDs which means that

785
01:02:57.36 --> 01:03:01.44
the person that's going to get blown up is what activates the IED so they have some kind of

786
01:03:01.44 --> 01:03:07.92
a pressure plate or a crunch wire or something that a humvy runs over and causes the IED to detonate

787
01:03:07.92 --> 01:03:15.04
that was sort of the the premier mode that the enemy was in at this point which meant that if you were

788
01:03:15.04 --> 01:03:22.24
in the first vehicle you were most likely to hit that IED and I remember I'd you know one of

789
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:29.52
those nights came out and looked up and looked up at Mark and and I said hey are you feeling

790
01:03:29.52 --> 01:03:33.84
lucky tonight and he said a big smile on his face and he said that the thing that one of the

791
01:03:33.84 --> 01:03:38.56
other things he had said in Vegas besides you know winner the new Cadillacs and one of the other

792
01:03:38.56 --> 01:03:42.32
things that he'd get everybody saying is when the dealer would bust you know he'd say

793
01:03:42.32 --> 01:03:49.68
everybody's a winner everybody's a winner as I looked up at him and he anyway said everybody's a winner

794
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:53.92
and then it was another time I went out there and you know I said I said you read rock and roll

795
01:03:53.92 --> 01:03:59.28
tonight and he stood there in the turret and like like a movie you know there's have those

796
01:03:59.28 --> 01:04:05.84
cheesy salute scenes in a movie where the the guy is salute's the officer he like stood at

797
01:04:05.84 --> 01:04:10.96
attention to his turret and just cracked me a super crisp salute and I probably like flipped them off

798
01:04:10.96 --> 01:04:18.48
or you know which is highly unusual for a seal to do that yeah yeah but you could see man he just

799
01:04:18.48 --> 01:04:27.44
had that confidence in that comfort in who he was in what he stood for and he was ready for

800
01:04:28.56 --> 01:04:36.24
he was ready for anything including including the ultimate he was a phenomenal guy absolutely

801
01:04:36.24 --> 01:04:43.84
and just an honor an honor reserve wouldn't like that.

802
01:04:44.64 --> 01:04:53.12
I think the last guy that they kind of represent in in the movie American Cypher is

803
01:04:56.40 --> 01:04:58.40
Biggles

804
01:04:58.40 --> 01:05:06.48
Ryan Job nicknamed Biggles who if you're in if you're in the military if you're in the

805
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:11.76
seal teams and you use it heavy weapon the weapon the nickname for that weapon is a big

806
01:05:12.56 --> 01:05:17.52
pain in the ass weapon of carry and the nickname for it's a pig and you're actually a pig

807
01:05:17.52 --> 01:05:23.12
gunner if you're if you carry that big mark 48 used to be in M60 now it's a mark 48 they call

808
01:05:23.12 --> 01:05:26.24
that weapon a pig because you know you gotta carry that pig and now you're a pig gunner

809
01:05:26.24 --> 01:05:30.40
and his nickname was Biggles and he nicknamed his weapon Piggles.

810
01:05:30.40 --> 01:05:32.32
Piggles.

811
01:05:34.32 --> 01:05:42.000
Just to think about the way they represented Ryan and I don't remember all that well again they

812
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.68
they add a special screening of Americans sniper forest down here in Cornado that's when I saw

813
01:05:45.68 --> 01:05:52.24
I saw it one time and so I don't fully remember how they I definitely remembered how they

814
01:05:52.24 --> 01:05:58.88
represented Chris Mark obviously but you know Ryan they didn't seem as significant of as

815
01:05:58.88 --> 01:06:06.72
a role so that it was a little bit they didn't make such a production out of Biggles but obviously

816
01:06:06.72 --> 01:06:15.20
in doing that they again shortchanged just a fabulous character and an incredibly

817
01:06:15.20 --> 01:06:33.52
funny and lively and warm human being that was an absolute just an absolute treasure of a person

818
01:06:35.44 --> 01:06:39.68
and so no one's gonna you know if you if all you do is see the movie of Americans sniper

819
01:06:39.68 --> 01:06:48.16
and even if even if we wrote an entire book about Biggles you wouldn't be able to get across

820
01:06:49.12 --> 01:06:56.56
what any of these guys really brought to life yeah he was he was a phenomenal guy and

821
01:06:57.92 --> 01:07:07.04
I actually you know some some people some people talk to me people said to me before you know

822
01:07:07.04 --> 01:07:11.68
hey he was a greatest person you've ever met some phenomenal people in my life you know and I

823
01:07:11.68 --> 01:07:18.32
I think the my immediate reaction that is Brian Jo Brian Jo of the greatest person I mean he just was

824
01:07:18.96 --> 01:07:24.96
he was and it was actually what's crazy is when I when I first met Ryan and when he he joined

825
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:29.84
our cartoon he got the nickname Biggles because he didn't exactly have the rippling six back

826
01:07:30.96 --> 01:07:35.92
he was just a toughest nails guy that just would not quit no matter what was determined to be a

827
01:07:35.92 --> 01:07:41.76
seal but struggle with the run struggle with the swams and got the what we call the full benefit

828
01:07:41.76 --> 01:07:50.56
in our seal train but he was he was known credible athlete or physical specimen especially when

829
01:07:50.56 --> 01:07:55.44
he showed up in Charlie Pettin and T.U. Bruser you know doubt he was not ready for the teams at that

830
01:07:55.44 --> 01:08:01.28
point when Biggles got the Charlie Pettin yeah we rolled the right out to the deserts of Southern

831
01:08:01.28 --> 01:08:08.40
California and got what we call land warfare training on and that was that's really man gap that's

832
01:08:08.40 --> 01:08:13.92
you know we talk about seal training and people think it's all about carrying logs around and boats

833
01:08:13.92 --> 01:08:18.16
and all that stuff that you see from that's really just our initial screening process what we call

834
01:08:18.16 --> 01:08:23.28
buds basically on our demolition seal training going out and working together in a workup is really

835
01:08:23.28 --> 01:08:31.04
where the training to be a seal to be a teammate to work as a as a unit happens and so our whole

836
01:08:31.04 --> 01:08:37.20
task in it from jacco all the way down to our lowest common denominator the most junior rank

837
01:08:37.20 --> 01:08:43.52
you man who happened to be Ryan J. We went out to we went out to Southern California deserts and just

838
01:08:43.52 --> 01:08:49.60
and we shot weapons we learned how to shoot we communicate and it is everything is difficult it is

839
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:56.96
you're going you're dragging down men you know her killed in for training purposes over rocks

840
01:08:56.96 --> 01:09:02.40
and through cactus and you're running and gun in and it's hot and it's tiring and exhausting

841
01:09:02.40 --> 01:09:07.76
and it's awesome and it's the training we're same training that's kept seals alive on the battlefield

842
01:09:07.76 --> 01:09:12.56
and unable to do things for for a long time and seals have been training there since the

843
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:17.92
Vietnam that particular place where we go and try in there and it's awesome I love it out there and

844
01:09:17.92 --> 01:09:26.48
when Biggles got out there he was he was struggling he was coming off of about I'd say 30 to 45

845
01:09:26.48 --> 01:09:31.28
days of leaving he's he living he was and he'd gone you know after buds where he'd had to make it

846
01:09:31.28 --> 01:09:35.60
to try and he had to be in shape and now you know one of the things some people struggle with when

847
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:41.68
they get done with that training is now it's up to them now it's up to them to be in shape

848
01:09:41.68 --> 01:09:47.52
self this and some people have that self this man and some people don't and I certainly want

849
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:54.48
to peak physical condition after that I I struggled with that but Biggles took that to a new level

850
01:09:54.48 --> 01:10:00.000
and you know he came out there all the summer hand in him 25 pound mark 48 machin gun

851
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.08
which he named Biggles this yaku said and and he's got to carry this thing and carry the six to

852
01:10:06.08 --> 01:10:14.48
800 rounds on him and move through the jagged rocks and sand and desert in 115 degree heat

853
01:10:14.48 --> 01:10:19.60
and and he was struggling he was struggling anyone even in a greatest of shape that's challenging

854
01:10:19.60 --> 01:10:25.28
but Ryan was really struggling to keep up on that and so I remember having some very he was in my

855
01:10:25.28 --> 01:10:30.40
squad and so I was witnessing this I was watching this and we pulled him aside and said hey

856
01:10:31.68 --> 01:10:38.48
listen if you want to be here you better aren't you you got a hard nut the standard is here

857
01:10:39.68 --> 01:10:43.68
you know the standard is way up here and you're here you're way lower than that standard so

858
01:10:44.48 --> 01:10:49.28
we had to we had to push him to get there and I remember some stern counseling sessions

859
01:10:49.28 --> 01:10:53.68
we assigned one of the guys from the the triumphant I mentioned before was one of the guys on

860
01:10:53.68 --> 01:11:01.28
his therapist tone great dude our most experienced machine gunner and we assigned we assigned him

861
01:11:01.28 --> 01:11:06.80
to to be a mentor to to big goals and train with him and so every morning we would

862
01:11:07.28 --> 01:11:13.76
PT work go for wrongs and we so when got other guys were resting Ryan's goal he's got to go out

863
01:11:13.76 --> 01:11:18.32
for run he's cranking out pull ups he's he's training and working and you know it was I didn't know

864
01:11:18.32 --> 01:11:23.52
how was going to go then he had a long way to go to get to where he needed to be to be physically

865
01:11:23.52 --> 01:11:28.24
able to keep up and not track down the rest of the guys and I don't think I've ever seen a guy

866
01:11:30.24 --> 01:11:34.24
make that kind of a transformation dude and there's an incredible transfer man Ryan must have looked

867
01:11:34.24 --> 01:11:39.20
himself in the mirror and said this is what I want to do I am going to turn this around completely

868
01:11:39.20 --> 01:11:46.32
and he became what we called big goals 2000 which is the new model and I mean he by the time we

869
01:11:46.32 --> 01:11:52.64
deployed you know six months eight months after that that that workup he was born again hard he was born

870
01:11:52.64 --> 01:12:01.44
again hard and he he was a he never fell behind anything and he always kept up with everybody

871
01:12:01.44 --> 01:12:06.96
and carried not only his way but sometimes others who were struggling and he would help them through

872
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:13.04
and it was it was funny a couple of stories about him we were at at Nylon he's in the weight room

873
01:12:13.04 --> 01:12:17.20
and you know one of the things about bud you're doing pull ups and you know I know jocca when

874
01:12:17.20 --> 01:12:22.72
his twitter fetal is as the pictures of like ripped off calisers from dude pull ups or dead

875
01:12:22.72 --> 01:12:27.12
lifts you know with the with the barbell and that's just part of bud to me you tear up your hands

876
01:12:27.12 --> 01:12:32.40
on the ropes and all the oak horse and everything you're doing and so we're in the gym

877
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:40.48
at out in our land warfare training facility and he's got these like the fingerless like

878
01:12:40.48 --> 01:12:48.32
weight lifting gloves on like you see in like gold's gym and I'm like not allowed I don't

879
01:12:48.32 --> 01:12:54.72
like seriously I was like big let's come here why do you have gloves on he's like well I'm just

880
01:12:54.72 --> 01:12:59.52
trying to protect my head you like getting some actually I was like no no you need a hard

881
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:05.20
hands up man no gloves and he was he I was like Roger that no gloves and he took that to such an

882
01:13:05.20 --> 01:13:10.24
extreme on our operations we always work offs our operations because you're having a

883
01:13:10.24 --> 01:13:17.12
smash through a window or wrestle down a prisoner and grab a hot barrel of a hot barrel of a

884
01:13:17.12 --> 01:13:22.56
a smoking red you know red glowing red hot machine gun he was a machine gun or so he had to deal

885
01:13:22.56 --> 01:13:27.76
with that stuff so we were we're married we were in the cancels gloves are similar to to protect

886
01:13:27.76 --> 01:13:33.36
our hands from that and and I remember on patrol and and Iraq looking at me like no gloves on

887
01:13:33.84 --> 01:13:39.20
he took that to such an extreme is like I am gonna be a hard dude and I'm gonna roll out with

888
01:13:39.20 --> 01:13:43.20
with no gloves I want to carry this machine and I was like hey man where you go they're like hey where

889
01:13:43.20 --> 01:13:50.80
you go I'm good I'm good and I don't know if it was not smart not smart but hard but tough and

890
01:13:50.80 --> 01:13:56.24
he was unbelievably tough and you know after Ryan got wounded and people that know the story of

891
01:13:56.24 --> 01:14:00.48
Ryan he got hit in the face so it would be sniper round on the same day that Mark Lee was killed

892
01:14:00.48 --> 01:14:07.92
August 2nd 2006 and we thought he was we thought he was a dead man you know when when when he got hit

893
01:14:07.92 --> 01:14:15.04
the wound just looked so horrific I just didn't think anybody could survive that and yet he did

894
01:14:15.04 --> 01:14:19.20
and I went over to grab his hand it said hey man we're gonna get you out of your hanging there

895
01:14:19.60 --> 01:14:24.48
and he like sat up and told me he was okay I was like it was unbelievable to see that I'm

896
01:14:24.48 --> 01:14:35.20
just how tough that guy was and you know after that we were waiting for about three weeks to see

897
01:14:35.20 --> 01:14:40.88
he lost his right eye where he got hit and we realized later that he the only reason he didn't

898
01:14:40.88 --> 01:14:46.80
get killed is because he was disciplined and he was on that machine and we were we were two hours

899
01:14:46.80 --> 01:14:52.24
into an operation it was a brutally hot day you know probably hitting 117 degree high in

900
01:14:52.24 --> 01:14:58.72
Ramadi and and he was on his weapon looking down the sights and the round that was aimed for

901
01:14:58.72 --> 01:15:05.68
his head hit his weapon hit the receiver on that machine gun and and deflected kind of back

902
01:15:05.68 --> 01:15:10.24
toward the right side of his face rather than taking a set off and and that's what saved his life

903
01:15:10.24 --> 01:15:16.64
that discipline and but tragically not only did he lose his right eye but the shrapnel from that

904
01:15:16.64 --> 01:15:22.000
severed the the optic nerve to his left eye and he was left blind completely blind from that

905
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and it was devastating when I got the news from that and yet when I talked to him on the phone

906
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.84
and he'd been intubated so he had this kind of really horse voice right so you know because they'd

907
01:15:31.84 --> 01:15:38.64
had him in an induced coma for a while I think it was a week or so several days it was a long time

908
01:15:38.64 --> 01:15:43.36
and it seemed like forever and so we're waiting to hear you know sights going to come back or he's

909
01:15:43.36 --> 01:15:47.36
going to you know have his left eye I mean this is the difference between you know

910
01:15:47.36 --> 01:15:52.32
permanently disabled for the rest of his life or just having a new sense of not having you know one

911
01:15:52.32 --> 01:15:57.28
eye and when we got that word is devastation I mean I'm talking to him on the phone and he

912
01:15:57.28 --> 01:16:01.60
didn't this horse you know horse voice he's talking to just tell me it's okay and he's joking about

913
01:16:01.60 --> 01:16:07.04
wanting to get a parrot on his shoulder and eye patch you know so he could look like a pirate and he just

914
01:16:07.04 --> 01:16:13.20
to just a phenomenal guy and I don't know that I ever had a conversation with with Ryan from that

915
01:16:13.20 --> 01:16:18.24
day forward that where we did it laugh hysterically I mean he was the kind of guy that just

916
01:16:18.24 --> 01:16:24.000
looked at all the things he could still do in life was not going to dwell on his disability

917
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.16
was not dwell on the fact that his eyesight had been taken from him in the prime of his life

918
01:16:28.80 --> 01:16:34.40
you know and he just was a phenomenal guy he showed me the true meaning of toughness

919
01:16:35.84 --> 01:16:42.000
and he just was of selflessness and it was it was just it was phenomenal be around

920
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.28
I mean he was just he would he was just such a fun again I you know you were I was thinking about it

921
01:16:47.28 --> 01:16:52.48
when I was I was listening to it earlier podcast and you were quoting from the book that I gave you

922
01:16:53.44 --> 01:16:57.44
about the time you gave me about face I think a few months after that you get I gave you the

923
01:16:57.44 --> 01:17:02.88
wars I knew it by a general geologist Pat and junior and I was thinking you know Jaclyn mentioned

924
01:17:02.88 --> 01:17:08.48
that we were watching Pat and in Ramadi and just to put that respect we were watching we were

925
01:17:08.48 --> 01:17:13.84
project the film up onto the back wall of the camp and literally it's about a 20 foot high wall

926
01:17:13.84 --> 01:17:19.28
just on the other side of this wall is bad guys I mean if we actually did a bunch of

927
01:17:19.28 --> 01:17:23.84
operations right outside that wall so I mean this so here we are you know watch we're all in

928
01:17:23.84 --> 01:17:28.56
PT geared smoking cigars it went in our like workout you know shorts and shirts we're in

929
01:17:28.56 --> 01:17:33.36
flip flops you had like a you know these huge camel spiders run across your feet you don't want to

930
01:17:33.36 --> 01:17:37.92
get bitten by those things they're pretty nasty but we watched that movie a patent and our

931
01:17:37.92 --> 01:17:44.88
member of a ticket Ryan was just so he was so he thought it was so hilarious there's a scene in

932
01:17:44.88 --> 01:17:50.72
the movie which is a phenomenal you had to say the George C. Scott movie is phenomenal but there's a

933
01:17:50.72 --> 01:17:55.52
scene the movie where Pat and gets passed over for promotion and one of his peers Omar Bradley

934
01:17:55.52 --> 01:18:01.20
who had actually been a subordinate to Pat and he is getting promoted above Pat and so it's obviously

935
01:18:01.20 --> 01:18:07.60
devastating it's obviously crushing for Pat and so one of his aides runs up to him and

936
01:18:07.60 --> 01:18:14.32
he has the news but Pat doesn't have the news yet and he's like Sir General can I pour you a

937
01:18:14.32 --> 01:18:20.56
warm glass of milk can I draw you bath and Ryan for some reason thought that was absolutely

938
01:18:20.56 --> 01:18:25.20
hilarious and I remember on multiple operations we'd come back you know what guys were smoked and tired

939
01:18:25.92 --> 01:18:32.40
and bigles a rope to me and say Sir can I pour you warm glass of milk can I draw you back

940
01:18:32.40 --> 01:18:37.76
and just laugh and stare if that was like shut the hell up but we had some good times the

941
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:45.84
first one I remember talking to him on the phone when he came out of the induced coma and again

942
01:18:45.84 --> 01:18:55.52
you know like you I'm thinking you know what do you say right and of course

943
01:18:55.52 --> 01:19:03.76
he just put you at ease and just starts making jokes and then he says to me it's serious and he says to me

944
01:19:03.76 --> 01:19:24.000
I want to come back

945
01:19:33.76 --> 01:19:51.92
he says I want to come back can I come back and you know I said to him listen

946
01:19:51.92 --> 01:20:05.36
just get healed up and you can come back and he's like Roger that and he goes don't worry

947
01:20:05.36 --> 01:20:14.80
and I said don't worry what he said don't worry I can still shoot and I said okay and he goes

948
01:20:14.80 --> 01:20:24.48
and Sir I can smell that I said what he was I can smell the enemy and I'll know where to shoot

949
01:20:25.52 --> 01:20:32.48
and I said all right if you get healed up I will bring you back over here and unfortunately I mean

950
01:20:32.48 --> 01:20:38.72
he was in real rough shape it wasn't like he was just blind I mean he had massive damage to his

951
01:20:38.72 --> 01:20:46.000
signuses to his face and you know we didn't get to your home before he could even even

952
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.96
would have a possibility of coming back but he certainly would have of course no doubt about it

953
01:20:50.96 --> 01:20:55.68
and that was incredibly genuine and that's just the kind of guy Ryan was and and what's amazing is

954
01:20:57.04 --> 01:21:04.64
you know he he went on to do so many things and you know he married his his girlfriend the time

955
01:21:04.64 --> 01:21:11.28
was it is a phenomenal lady incredibly incredibly phenomenal lady and he went back to school

956
01:21:12.24 --> 01:21:21.76
after he got out he was medically retired he graduated with a business degree at a 4.0 I was like

957
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:29.52
Ryan I do I think I had like a 2.8 3 like but I got well I said man what like what in the world

958
01:21:29.52 --> 01:21:35.28
and I mean he just he just could not be kept down and and he went and climbed he's some

959
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:41.04
of the mountain near 14,000 plus foot mountain completely blind I mean that's a difficult mountain

960
01:21:41.04 --> 01:21:46.56
a lot of people get killed trying to climb that mountain with the full use of their limbs and

961
01:21:46.56 --> 01:21:52.88
and eyesight and and he went and did that great organization called Camp Patriot that helps

962
01:21:52.88 --> 01:22:01.44
wounded that and it taken him up on that climb and he called me up and said hey life we're going

963
01:22:01.44 --> 01:22:06.96
elk hunting and something we talked about in Iraq because Ryan was a big hunter grew up in

964
01:22:06.96 --> 01:22:11.44
in Washington state and had going on and I grew up in Texas and I loved to hunt and and I

965
01:22:11.44 --> 01:22:17.36
went on a call rod I'd hunted up there elk hunting so we talked about doing an elk hunt and

966
01:22:17.36 --> 01:22:23.28
you know now I thought well it's we can go you know we can listen to the elk and he can be

967
01:22:23.28 --> 01:22:27.52
you know part of the hot but he can't you know how can he actually shoot an animal we can't

968
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:32.64
actually do that anymore and he said it's like they got some kind of gadget tree for me

969
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:39.04
you know set up he's like I'm gonna shoot an elk and I was like is it are you in it was kind of like

970
01:22:39.04 --> 01:22:46.40
hunter-divered and I was like I'm in absolutely I'm in and I think it was like my 10-year

971
01:22:46.40 --> 01:22:52.64
naval carrier to go I was like cancel that we're going on so Ryan and I went uh went up there with

972
01:22:52.64 --> 01:23:00.40
camp-pature they had this crazy like gadget set up on the on the the scope of the weapon and it was

973
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:05.84
up it was a camera and and it was so you could look through it the sights and so we kind of had this

974
01:23:05.84 --> 01:23:10.40
I was spotting form looking through the camera we kind of got in situated kind of told him when

975
01:23:10.40 --> 01:23:16.32
it went to hold we kind of had like a ready fire terminology we came up with and one thing

976
01:23:16.32 --> 01:23:21.60
about Ryan is that dude could shoot and you know he he struggled at Nyland originally keeping up

977
01:23:21.60 --> 01:23:27.12
and you know with his physical fitness until he became bigdles 2000 then was born again hard

978
01:23:27.12 --> 01:23:32.08
but when we got to our shooting schools we realized what this guy could shoot he was a great

979
01:23:32.08 --> 01:23:36.88
shot and so when we were training with that that rifle we were on the range and we were practiced

980
01:23:36.88 --> 01:23:41.52
into going this elk hunt I'm talking a man on the target I realized right away like if we

981
01:23:41.52 --> 01:23:45.68
missed it's my fault because he's gonna be he's gonna write when I tell him to pull the trigger he's

982
01:23:45.68 --> 01:23:50.88
hitting that target and he's gonna it's gonna be right wherever that cross area so we kind of figured it out

983
01:23:50.88 --> 01:23:57.52
and we went out and tracked this this huge elk down that was donated by a you know a great

984
01:23:57.52 --> 01:24:05.76
great good folks and we went out the shot a gigantic like a little class elk and he was and then

985
01:24:05.76 --> 01:24:10.56
once we got it we're cleaning the thing and he just you know he just he wanted to got his hands

986
01:24:10.56 --> 01:24:15.84
in there like elbow deep and and in the cleaning process and just it was it was a phenomenal

987
01:24:15.84 --> 01:24:20.80
phenomenal experience and Ryan just couldn't meet he could not be kept down he he focused on everything

988
01:24:20.80 --> 01:24:25.52
then he could still do and it was some of the things I couldn't even explain I remember when

989
01:24:26.40 --> 01:24:33.52
he was living in the Phoenix area and I went out to visit him and we're dry we had gone out to breakfast

990
01:24:33.52 --> 01:24:40.80
and we're driving back to his house and this is he only moved there after his blind so he never

991
01:24:40.80 --> 01:24:47.84
been in this area before and we're driving past you like you just missed the turn and I'm like obviously

992
01:24:47.84 --> 01:24:51.92
I'm driving he's blind he's sitting in the past you're seeing it I was like what do you mean how do you

993
01:24:51.92 --> 01:24:57.52
know that is that I just you should have turned back there and I was like you know soon it

994
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:01.28
I was from my little smart phone I met math it out and it was like you're exactly right

995
01:25:01.28 --> 01:25:05.20
I'm going to do a new turn go back I don't know he had laid it out in his mind just the grid the

996
01:25:05.20 --> 01:25:10.72
grid system and what how long it took to go where and it was it was phenomenal and he taught

997
01:25:10.72 --> 01:25:17.20
me so much about just toughness and selflessness and just the attitude of being a little overcome

998
01:25:17.20 --> 01:25:23.68
many challenge to be thankful for the bless is even given and he was just just of incredibly

999
01:25:23.68 --> 01:25:33.84
awesome warrior teammate and friend and and we miss him I used to grapple with him you know after

1000
01:25:33.84 --> 01:25:43.76
he was blind and he wrestled he wrestled in high school and so he had some scrap to him and

1001
01:25:43.76 --> 01:25:47.52
I remember you know first of all he used to have that tears that come out of that eye

1002
01:25:48.08 --> 01:25:51.76
so he'd be like constantly kind of wiping the eye and getting tears all over me

1003
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:55.92
then I'd be given a hard time about that like quick grind on the baby

1004
01:25:57.60 --> 01:26:02.80
Yeah, but it was awesome it was awesome that's a great sport that you can do you know just it's you realize how much

1005
01:26:02.80 --> 01:26:07.52
contact is involved when you're when you're doing that and how you can it's so instinctual and

1006
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:12.88
but that was another thing he just was like oh yeah I'll grapple I don't care can't see no factor

1007
01:26:13.84 --> 01:26:18.16
and I always had to make him pay for the for the the time

1008
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:27.60
wait where the Chris that's one of Chris Kyle's little you know little scams that he played was

1009
01:26:27.60 --> 01:26:34.56
Let me let me let me tell that that was uh because I had I had a good eye witness to this scenario

1010
01:26:34.56 --> 01:26:38.56
so jocco's our task in a commander you know and he's a black belt resilient you jits

1011
01:26:38.56 --> 01:26:42.72
who never one knows this because we're training at five o'clock every morning and we're all showing

1012
01:26:42.72 --> 01:26:48.16
up and doing jitsu and it's show can each other out you can always see our you could tell who our

1013
01:26:48.16 --> 01:26:53.68
taskin it was because when you called a name of someone we would turn our heads return our entire

1014
01:26:53.68 --> 01:27:00.000
shoulders at the same time because our next we're getting cranked up that's right because we had

1015
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
just battled Royale as you would encourage it but in particular you know Chris and we talked about

1016
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.88
Chris Kyle since the year was a phenomenal guy he had a great relationship with with with Ryan and

1017
01:27:10.88 --> 01:27:15.92
really kind of took Ryan under his wing and and one of the things Chris like to do was

1018
01:27:16.56 --> 01:27:24.40
instigate he was a huge instigator and and so they would they they talked Ryan into like hey

1019
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:30.24
bigdles come here you know some bigdles the new guys fired up like hey I want you to go get up

1020
01:27:30.24 --> 01:27:35.60
in a safe space you know so you and they they'd have him come up and like standing your face in

1021
01:27:35.60 --> 01:27:40.88
like stare at you like one like one millimeter from your nose yes that's what you do which was obviously

1022
01:27:40.88 --> 01:27:46.64
it's very provocative and and so that was the whole point they were trying to just instigate some kind

1023
01:27:46.64 --> 01:27:51.44
of which you know I I just shoved them across the room get out of my face you know they had him do

1024
01:27:51.44 --> 01:27:57.92
it to jaco he wouldn't do it for a little bit he kind of did everybody else and and so they're like

1025
01:27:57.92 --> 01:28:03.44
you're gonna do it to jaco you know you know you know he balls you would do it to jaco so finally he's

1026
01:28:03.44 --> 01:28:07.76
like I'm sick of these guys tell me I got a poo I'm a new guy I mean they said these manhoods on the

1027
01:28:07.76 --> 01:28:13.68
line I'm gonna go do it to jaco and we and he did it in a pretty public forum because we were

1028
01:28:13.92 --> 01:28:19.92
we were planning this is on our trip we're actually practicing like urban assaults so we're in

1029
01:28:19.92 --> 01:28:25.20
this kind it's kind of a theater type set and guys are you know planning the mission and I remember

1030
01:28:25.20 --> 01:28:29.84
watching every so they not only they talked him into it jaco doesn't know this but we all know

1031
01:28:29.84 --> 01:28:36.40
it's common so everyone's watching this and it's all of a sudden jaco turns around it's so I think

1032
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:42.96
Chris or some like he's like hey jaco jaco turns around and bigels it's standing like one millimeter

1033
01:28:42.96 --> 01:28:48.96
from his face given this like needle stared down and jaco just grabs him like you know grabs

1034
01:28:48.96 --> 01:28:55.44
him like turns him around you know gets his back within like in like half a second and just throws

1035
01:28:55.44 --> 01:29:04.08
a throw a rear naked choke on him and he had to go sleepy time and he's like yeah so you got a rear

1036
01:29:04.08 --> 01:29:09.52
naked choke on you're like tapping he's like tapping tapping tapping and jaco's like I don't accept

1037
01:29:09.52 --> 01:29:16.32
taps and he just it's so he goes to sleep jaco just kind of gently lays him down on the floor

1038
01:29:16.32 --> 01:29:20.80
and then we just kind of and he just went on about anyway that's kind of normal day of the

1039
01:29:20.80 --> 01:29:25.84
year and then you know so like you know six or eight seconds goes by he like comes back kind of slowly

1040
01:29:25.84 --> 01:29:31.28
comes to gets up to a knee then stands up he's like kind of moves around like what happened

1041
01:29:31.28 --> 01:29:36.96
and we're all kind of jaco's just acting like nothing happened to the other day and everyone is laughing

1042
01:29:36.96 --> 01:29:42.48
hysterically and then you know rhymes like you're going to have my back because they told like

1043
01:29:42.48 --> 01:29:48.72
we'll have you back and so I did like coach when I was like hey bigels look man they're not going

1044
01:29:48.72 --> 01:29:53.68
to have your back to a whole point I wanted to see you get choked out so so after that I think it was a good

1045
01:29:53.68 --> 01:29:59.44
learning experience but pretty legit good time and he was a great great sport about that just like

1046
01:29:59.44 --> 01:30:06.64
everything else yeah yeah so like you said just an amazing amazing amazing guy and if anybody wants to

1047
01:30:08.24 --> 01:30:14.24
anybody's feeling sorry for themselves or you know these people that ask about mental toughness just

1048
01:30:14.24 --> 01:30:27.52
think yourself about about right there's one more guy that that I've been asked about a decent

1049
01:30:27.52 --> 01:30:37.04
amount and it's a guy that was in the lift hotel in the markedly episode and again I was new

1050
01:30:37.04 --> 01:30:41.60
that you'd be coming on at some point to talk about and we'd have an opportunity to talk about

1051
01:30:41.60 --> 01:30:53.60
Tony and Tony Fraddy and Tony is a guy that I actually grew up with in the seal teams he was

1052
01:30:54.24 --> 01:31:00.88
and and just as you might suspect when you watch live to tell and you see what his attitude is like

1053
01:31:02.16 --> 01:31:08.96
he was a hard drinking fist fighting beer swilling frog man

1054
01:31:08.96 --> 01:31:16.16
and you know and still is and still is to this day and there was you know how often he would

1055
01:31:16.16 --> 01:31:22.48
come to work on Monday morning with a shinner or brood you know bloody knuckles it was just it was just

1056
01:31:22.48 --> 01:31:27.76
a normal occurrence I mean no we didn't even get asked questions about it back then so Tony Fraddy

1057
01:31:27.76 --> 01:31:34.56
was an old school seal team one guy that you know kind of like me grew up in the seal teams and grew

1058
01:31:34.56 --> 01:31:41.68
up in that era of the 90s and the dry years still had some Vietnam veteran mentorship but

1059
01:31:42.72 --> 01:31:48.40
didn't really get that opportunity to be in combat until you know until obviously until September

1060
01:31:48.40 --> 01:31:56.24
11th and what we actually even though we were both that team one together we were never an

1061
01:31:56.24 --> 01:32:00.24
opportunity together so we were buddies we were drinking buddies we hung out but we never did

1062
01:32:00.24 --> 01:32:05.36
a platoon together and so I knew he had a very good reputation he had a very good reputation as an

1063
01:32:05.36 --> 01:32:11.84
operator he always had that but I never really worked with him it wasn't until we were in task

1064
01:32:11.84 --> 01:32:20.32
unit bruiser together that I actually worked with him for the first time and when I realized

1065
01:32:20.32 --> 01:32:32.80
for the first time what I had in Tony beyond the toughness and beyond the tactical prowess was

1066
01:32:32.80 --> 01:32:36.96
when we were actually at we were at land warfare training the training that you were just talking

1067
01:32:36.96 --> 01:32:45.60
about and you know there was a little kind of a quick operation to pull off and it was just a

1068
01:32:45.60 --> 01:32:49.76
quick you know hey go and assault this area it was the daytime it was basically going through the

1069
01:32:49.76 --> 01:32:57.28
mechanics of an assault on a target and I was watching you and Tony Tony was your platoon chief I was

1070
01:32:57.28 --> 01:33:03.12
watching you to kind of figure out the plan and you threw a couple ideas out there and he just said

1071
01:33:03.12 --> 01:33:07.60
hey sir here's what we should do boom put these guys over here set up a base over here bring the

1072
01:33:07.60 --> 01:33:12.16
maneuver over here but one over watch position on this hill that's how we should do this and

1073
01:33:13.36 --> 01:33:19.52
you looked at him and said that's awesome that's perfect let's get everyone over here and

1074
01:33:19.52 --> 01:33:23.44
why don't you just go ahead and breathe them up and he looked at you and he said

1075
01:33:24.40 --> 01:33:31.12
Nusser you tell him what to do it'll be better coming from you and so here was a guy that

1076
01:33:31.12 --> 01:33:38.56
obviously because he'd been in the teams for 15 or 17 years obviously had more tactical experience than

1077
01:33:38.56 --> 01:33:47.28
you did but he was so secure in his leadership and so secure in his tactical knowledge that it didn't

1078
01:33:47.28 --> 01:33:51.76
mean anything to him and he realized that the best thing that he could do for the team and for

1079
01:33:51.76 --> 01:34:01.12
your platoon was to let you lead this let you put out the word let you give the plan and I realized

1080
01:34:01.12 --> 01:34:06.56
at that point and this was early in our work up that this guy was not just a tactician not just a

1081
01:34:06.56 --> 01:34:17.52
tough badass frogman but he was a real leader and as I know you will say you are absolutely blessed

1082
01:34:17.52 --> 01:34:25.28
to have Tony as your platoon chief I gotta say the seal team has produced some phenomenal

1083
01:34:25.28 --> 01:34:32.80
phenomenal individuals some incredible battlefield leaders throughout the decades in the proud legacy

1084
01:34:32.80 --> 01:34:41.36
and history of the seal teams and I can say with confidence that I believe that Tony for

1085
01:34:41.36 --> 01:34:48.08
that he is probably one of the best combat leaders of seal teams has ever produced and I don't say

1086
01:34:48.08 --> 01:34:52.64
that very lightly at all but he was a phenomenal phenomenal battlefield leader and you've heard of

1087
01:34:52.64 --> 01:34:58.96
the break glass in case of war guys this is this is that guy and he was just

1088
01:34:58.96 --> 01:35:06.40
his experience level was phenomenal I mean he had had at this point to put it respectly visible

1089
01:35:06.40 --> 01:35:11.28
ten commander I'm on my second one so I had one deployment to Iraq joku had a few deployments before

1090
01:35:11.28 --> 01:35:18.08
because he was you know he would have been a enlistment for eight years and but you know Tony was this was his

1091
01:35:18.08 --> 01:35:22.88
eighth deployment I mean he had massive amounts of experience in the teams I think he had been busted

1092
01:35:22.88 --> 01:35:29.92
down in rank like twice you know hard fight and guy and he was he wanted to be that platoon chief

1093
01:35:29.92 --> 01:35:37.20
that's all he ever wanted to be and he was incredibly incredibly good at it I just I can remember

1094
01:35:37.20 --> 01:35:42.64
that same land war for a chat of you were just talking about we're under fire we're in a very

1095
01:35:42.64 --> 01:35:47.20
difficult situation there's a lot of chaos going on in this training environment here we are

1096
01:35:47.20 --> 01:35:52.32
preparing for actual combat and of course they're trying to make that as realistic as possible

1097
01:35:52.32 --> 01:35:57.44
and it's challenging as possible and we're getting shot at from like one of the target buildings and

1098
01:35:57.44 --> 01:36:06.32
it's made out of like you know two by fours and and plywood the target building that's that's nearby

1099
01:36:06.88 --> 01:36:12.16
Tony realizes that we got a self at target building now because we're taking fire from that building

1100
01:36:12.16 --> 01:36:19.20
and he does a like full on sprit like wide open for about 50 yards and does human

1101
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:24.64
battering ram into the doorway one man clearance the building and like kills the role player who's

1102
01:36:24.64 --> 01:36:30.48
shooting at us and it was like that's who's he's he's the total badass he's gonna handle the

1103
01:36:30.48 --> 01:36:36.72
situation and that's the guy he was on the battlefield I mean he definitely he was he was a guy

1104
01:36:36.72 --> 01:36:43.20
I mean we leaned on him the the only time that I ever had an issue working for Jockel will like

1105
01:36:43.20 --> 01:36:48.48
he was when Jockel said hey I'm gonna have to put Tony with this other group of guys

1106
01:36:48.48 --> 01:36:54.88
that's right and I was like I was furious and angry about that in a way that was and until

1107
01:36:54.88 --> 01:37:00.24
Jockel kind of took me under his wing he said you said hey here's why I'm doing that and here's why

1108
01:37:00.24 --> 01:37:05.52
I had to balance out some leadership you know and we put him with the most junior guy put on with

1109
01:37:05.52 --> 01:37:11.04
most junior officer who isn't incredibly capable guy and and did phenomenal stuff but it was the

1110
01:37:11.04 --> 01:37:16.56
right call the death it was the right call as much as I hated that but that was that was difficult

1111
01:37:16.56 --> 01:37:20.96
but Tony was just one of those guys that you know he was intimately evolved in the planning

1112
01:37:20.96 --> 01:37:25.36
default aggressive I mean just incredibly aggressive we're gonna go in there and we're gonna

1113
01:37:25.36 --> 01:37:30.24
hammer the enemy we're gonna go right in his backyard we're never gonna expect this and and

1114
01:37:30.24 --> 01:37:34.56
we're gonna we're gonna win we're gonna crush them they're gonna kill bad guys and and one of

1115
01:37:34.56 --> 01:37:40.80
the things that gained us momentum you know you talked about earlier Jockel of the the mortars that hit right

1116
01:37:40.80 --> 01:37:46.24
outside the building you were sitting in and killed the soldier wounded several others we had IDs going

1117
01:37:46.24 --> 01:37:50.08
often you were sitting in there and and the you were sitting in there and the you were going to

1118
01:37:50.08 --> 01:37:56.000
brigade I went to I was actually I met the brigade commander once I think or maybe twice but I

1119
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.32
went in there actually no what no it was the first time I ever met the brigade commander so I

1120
01:38:02.32 --> 01:38:11.60
go into meet the guy that's in charge of all of Ramadi and as I go into meet him I'm into I'm

1121
01:38:11.60 --> 01:38:17.52
in his tactical operations center and we had put guys Tony was out in the field doing a sniper

1122
01:38:17.52 --> 01:38:24.40
Overwatch for an ID for ID in place there's in an area called Firecracker where there was IDs all

1123
01:38:24.40 --> 01:38:32.72
the time and where days earlier an ID had gone off and had killed several Marines and wounded several more

1124
01:38:34.16 --> 01:38:40.16
so I come into the tactical operation center and and I'm in there for 30 seconds and a call comes in

1125
01:38:41.12 --> 01:38:45.84
and it's the Marines reporting back that one of the seal snipers had just killed an ID in place

1126
01:38:45.84 --> 01:38:52.24
or on firecracker and the brigade commander came out of his office to kind of see what what wait what

1127
01:38:52.24 --> 01:38:59.76
and then there I was and so it was the again like with the mortars I could not have ever

1128
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:05.76
set up a better introduction to the brigade commander than saying then then that happening at that

1129
01:39:05.76 --> 01:39:10.88
moment in time and we've been on the ground for maybe two or three days and already starting to

1130
01:39:10.88 --> 01:39:15.60
have an impact taken out these bad guys and and that fired the brigade commander up and he immediately

1131
01:39:15.60 --> 01:39:21.20
wanted to employ us in different locations throughout the city and that was like a blank check for

1132
01:39:21.20 --> 01:39:25.92
for getting after it for us was oh you want us to go into these worst the worst parts of

1133
01:39:25.92 --> 01:39:31.12
our body we will do so and we will do so immediately and that's exactly what we did

1134
01:39:32.32 --> 01:39:36.64
Tony really had a vision too as far as getting the platoon ready and making sure that we knew

1135
01:39:36.96 --> 01:39:43.20
he he had a feeling that we might need some sniper capability and so we plossed up the number of

1136
01:39:43.20 --> 01:39:49.68
snipers well beyond what the normal number is within our 60 man seal platoon to be ready for that and

1137
01:39:49.68 --> 01:39:55.04
he trained him and got him ready and and certainly leaned on Chris and his expertise there but

1138
01:39:55.04 --> 01:40:00.56
but Tony was really the driving force of getting our platoon qualified and ready to go and I

1139
01:40:00.56 --> 01:40:06.16
remember one time I particularly where we were we were we were looking through a we had moved into a

1140
01:40:06.16 --> 01:40:12.40
really really nasty area of south central mining and there were two buildings that were right next to each

1141
01:40:12.40 --> 01:40:18.08
other and we were several of us where I was in a group that was at with across the street the

1142
01:40:18.08 --> 01:40:21.68
Chris Chris and I were together on that one Tony was with another group of guys that were

1143
01:40:22.24 --> 01:40:27.20
across that were in a different set of buildings and the building that we were in just it just

1144
01:40:27.20 --> 01:40:31.04
wasn't a good position and we were trying to figure out where we need to go but it just was not

1145
01:40:31.04 --> 01:40:35.44
a good position the sun was going to come up within you know pretty soon we needed to get

1146
01:40:35.44 --> 01:40:39.76
it was just so we actually fell back and took a building right next to where Tony is guys

1147
01:40:39.76 --> 01:40:46.08
where we actually smashed through the concrete wall connecting them the wall the support there

1148
01:40:46.08 --> 01:40:50.40
there was no doorway or anything window but we had to make a walkways we could actually like

1149
01:40:50.40 --> 01:40:55.28
get it out and communicate with each other and I'm sitting there listening the radio and

1150
01:40:55.28 --> 01:40:59.52
you know my command control position after the sun came up and Tony was a sniper looking through

1151
01:40:59.52 --> 01:41:04.32
a loophole in the wall which is like a hole that was maybe six or eight inches on a diameter that

1152
01:41:04.32 --> 01:41:09.68
we smashed out with a sledgehammer sometimes we used explosive charges but it gave you a little bit

1153
01:41:09.68 --> 01:41:14.24
of cover so that you didn't get shot in the face by some enemy another enemy sniper across the

1154
01:41:14.24 --> 01:41:19.84
street or some ice you would have a machine gun and so he's sitting there on a sniper rifle

1155
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:26.16
and I just hear this crack and it was just a round coming in and it missed his head by like two

1156
01:41:26.16 --> 01:41:32.08
inches maybe I mean it came right in just you know whizzed past his face slam into the wall just behind him

1157
01:41:32.80 --> 01:41:39.84
and so I hear the crack and then I hear some profanity and then I hear some yeah I like Rambo Stel

1158
01:41:39.84 --> 01:41:46.48
yeah and then I hear just machine gun fire yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and so Tony

1159
01:41:46.48 --> 01:41:52.80
had the round and coming in past his face and Tony was best and he reached over grab a

1160
01:41:52.80 --> 01:41:57.36
Marnt 40 machine gun and dumped a hundred round belt through the you know through the

1161
01:41:57.36 --> 01:42:01.60
the loophole we had no idea where the round really came from but a hundred rounds got shot back

1162
01:42:01.60 --> 01:42:05.92
in the general direction and I think that was discouraging whoever was shooting in it so

1163
01:42:05.92 --> 01:42:09.76
that's a kind of guy who told me what he was he was gonna you should want to bullet at me

1164
01:42:09.76 --> 01:42:15.28
I'm sure I'm not going to let you back and you know he was the guy too we because he

1165
01:42:15.28 --> 01:42:20.08
in that relationship with you when I first checked into Cilteam 3 me and the Delta

1166
01:42:20.08 --> 01:42:22.88
Lieutenant Commander who's a good friend of mine that we gone through Budsweather,

1167
01:42:22.88 --> 01:42:31.60
Jaco, Reference earlier you know we heard about this guy, Jaco and and interestingly enough I

1168
01:42:31.60 --> 01:42:39.68
actually heard your name before mispronounce of course Jaco Willenek from a guy that I grew up with

1169
01:42:39.68 --> 01:42:45.20
when I was in like high school and he started training in Jiu Jitsu and I was starting to talk

1170
01:42:45.20 --> 01:42:49.44
about beat in the Cilteam so I wanted to be a seal on hitting the air our family friend and said yeah

1171
01:42:49.44 --> 01:42:55.04
I rolled Jiu Jitsu with this guy who's a seal this name was Jaco Willenek and he beat me in this

1172
01:42:55.04 --> 01:43:00.56
turn of his a great guy and I see he was talking about you and so so I had heard that name before

1173
01:43:00.56 --> 01:43:06.40
and and then we were working together team 3 I was like okay I heard this guy Jaco it's actually

1174
01:43:06.40 --> 01:43:11.44
for now to Willenek Jaco Willenek okay this is that same guy that I heard about you know years ago before

1175
01:43:11.44 --> 01:43:18.88
I was even in the Navy and so you know who is this guy we had met him before I knew a bunch of the

1176
01:43:18.88 --> 01:43:26.000
guys already in the Paltoon and Tony said I'm ever standing there looking at the board we have

1177
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.84
the boards like magnet boards of all the names are going to be in the Paltoon and you know I'm

1178
01:43:31.84 --> 01:43:35.20
I'm at the top of the OIC and then Tony's next and then you know what's your guys in our

1179
01:43:35.20 --> 01:43:41.12
youth Chris is kind of right up there and and he's like we're like he said what can you tell us

1180
01:43:41.12 --> 01:43:46.88
about Jaco he's like Jaco is the guy we want us our task in a commander we're good to go

1181
01:43:46.88 --> 01:43:54.24
that's like Roger that we're good so that was that was my first introduction to Jaco

1182
01:43:54.24 --> 01:43:58.88
yeah yeah and then as the Delta Potigimit, Jaco gave us this typical stare down

1183
01:43:58.88 --> 01:44:04.48
I am Jaco I don't like people when I face when he meets us I'm going to intimidate you

1184
01:44:04.48 --> 01:44:10.96
and look at you with Ferrod Brow and jutting out Jaco and I might have to fire you guys and

1185
01:44:10.96 --> 01:44:15.36
I don't know two weeks through weeks we never know so the Delta Potigimit is now you know just

1186
01:44:15.36 --> 01:44:20.48
you start a good buddy years and a great buddy of mine was was like who is this guy me he's

1187
01:44:20.48 --> 01:44:25.92
stared at me I don't know if you like so I can already tell yeah and Tony was like listen

1188
01:44:25.92 --> 01:44:37.28
he's good to go don't you worry Tony awesome just outstanding and I think one of the things

1189
01:44:37.28 --> 01:44:45.36
that impressed me about him was that he those old Vietnam lessons the old school just hardcore

1190
01:44:45.36 --> 01:44:53.76
frogman stuff he held the line on that as far as getting ready as far as gear inspections as

1191
01:44:53.76 --> 01:45:05.20
far as debriefs and the planning he just he just had that intense level of patience and of

1192
01:45:05.20 --> 01:45:13.36
focus on the operations like nothing else in the world mattered to him a he drove standards

1193
01:45:13.36 --> 01:45:19.84
no doubt I mean he enforced standards and he was just expected expected us to be hard you know

1194
01:45:19.84 --> 01:45:24.24
when guys wanted to get soft and hey you know do we really need to push ourselves out like no

1195
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:30.40
we're going to be hard and you know is that new Hampshire new Hampshire ax that did say you better

1196
01:45:30.40 --> 01:45:34.80
get you can't hide we're going we're going out to get it on and you know one of the things

1197
01:45:34.80 --> 01:45:41.84
that became a mantra for our Patum was BTF big tough frogman and what Tony would say that like hey

1198
01:45:41.84 --> 01:45:46.16
where we knew like we're going to be TF what are we going to do we're going to be TF in

1199
01:45:46.72 --> 01:45:51.20
we're going to get a big mix it up which meant a big gunfight they're going to be TF out

1200
01:45:51.20 --> 01:45:55.44
and then we added big child we're going to go to big child hit the child we're done but

1201
01:45:55.44 --> 01:45:59.92
BTF meant we're going to go in it's going to be hard it's going to be tough we better you know

1202
01:45:59.92 --> 01:46:03.44
we're going to carry a lot of these roads were so dangerous we didn't drive this we would

1203
01:46:03.44 --> 01:46:09.76
put patrol in for you know kilometers carry in heavy gear tons of water with us we had to

1204
01:46:09.76 --> 01:46:15.84
bring all that stuff in and it was just it was tough it was difficult and we were going to be TF

1205
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:22.24
and we took pride in that you know BTF pretty much came became a way to overcome any obstacle of any kind

1206
01:46:22.88 --> 01:46:30.16
mental physical environmental all yet to do just BTF you know oh there's some kind of a challenge

1207
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:39.76
at BTF BTF and then what are we going to do BTF more I see a rubber Tony said he's you know I don't

1208
01:46:39.76 --> 01:46:45.04
see a lot and he doesn't sleep a lot so we would spend time together we never really sleep it

1209
01:46:45.04 --> 01:46:50.24
and he'd come down to my office and I say what are you doing up and he goes all is just laying in my

1210
01:46:50.24 --> 01:46:56.000
bed just BTF BTF BTF BTF BTF BTF BTF so I've come and thank for you to come down and see

1211
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.64
I remember him sitting in the camp he would get you could track it we'd come back from an

1212
01:47:00.64 --> 01:47:06.08
op he'd be happy he was fired up we drop our gear every single time with with great tremendous

1213
01:47:06.08 --> 01:47:10.64
discipline I talked about him in forces standards hey we just got dealt with an op everyone's

1214
01:47:10.64 --> 01:47:15.20
tired everybody's exhausted drop your gear is what he tell everybody you know 10 minutes I

1215
01:47:15.20 --> 01:47:19.28
want you in the mission planning space and we go through that post operation debrief just

1216
01:47:19.28 --> 01:47:23.44
talking about what went right what went wrong will we learn from it what's the enemy doing now

1217
01:47:23.44 --> 01:47:27.12
that we hadn't seen before how come we adapted that every single time there was no cut in the

1218
01:47:27.12 --> 01:47:32.32
corners we did that every time we could do it and kind of a short concise concise form but he'd be

1219
01:47:32.32 --> 01:47:36.80
happy we just got back from the op we just went out did some damage and then you could track

1220
01:47:36.80 --> 01:47:44.16
Tony's like happiness factor it was inversely proportional is happiness factor was inversely

1221
01:47:44.16 --> 01:47:48.88
proportional to the amount of time we spent in the camp so as at the longer we stayed in the camp he's like

1222
01:47:48.88 --> 01:47:54.72
he's like getting angry I'm getting angry and if we had an op cancel which was pretty rare

1223
01:47:54.72 --> 01:47:59.52
but ever once while we'd have a night where we didn't go out and he would just be angry I

1224
01:47:59.52 --> 01:48:09.28
want to go out I want to go get some why are we in the camp and you know as we wrap up on Tony

1225
01:48:09.28 --> 01:48:19.60
and Tony was definitely a force but just so everybody knows that this was a task unit of 40 plus

1226
01:48:19.60 --> 01:48:25.60
guys and there was absolutely a core group in there and Charlie and Delta between of guys that were

1227
01:48:28.08 --> 01:48:37.36
without question without any question whatsoever warriors that

1228
01:48:37.36 --> 01:48:48.56
like I said held the line and told the line and went forward over and over again

1229
01:48:50.16 --> 01:48:54.48
and and the rest of the guys maybe the guys that weren't quite in leadership positions

1230
01:48:55.76 --> 01:49:01.84
but it was a very tough deployment casualties fire fights

1231
01:49:01.84 --> 01:49:15.68
killed wounded and there was stress massive amounts of stress and there was combat fatigue

1232
01:49:16.72 --> 01:49:28.72
and there was fear but all these guys overcame that fear to do their job

1233
01:49:28.72 --> 01:49:36.96
so we could accomplish the mission that was put in front of us I think that something has to be

1234
01:49:36.96 --> 01:49:41.12
recognized you know and it's uh some of these guys are still active duty and we we can't we're

1235
01:49:41.12 --> 01:49:46.40
not gonna name them we're not gonna talk about them but they were a critical critical part of the

1236
01:49:46.40 --> 01:49:49.92
team and that it's not you know as we kind of back to what we were talking about with America

1237
01:49:49.92 --> 01:49:54.40
Cypher earlier I mean I think Chris would be the first person to tell you that this is a team effort

1238
01:49:54.40 --> 01:49:59.84
it is a huge team effort and so we could have done the Cypher's gonna do any of the stuff

1239
01:49:59.84 --> 01:50:03.36
there doing without the machine gunners without guys carrying the rockets without the guys

1240
01:50:03.36 --> 01:50:08.56
carrying the radio and all the heavy equipment that goes with that and you know the corpsman

1241
01:50:08.56 --> 01:50:12.80
that's carrying his you know all of his equipment we couldn't have done any of that as seals

1242
01:50:12.80 --> 01:50:17.04
without the support from the army and Marine Corps and would support those guys brought to us and so

1243
01:50:17.04 --> 01:50:21.44
it was a massive massive team effort and just particularly those guys in in charge of

1244
01:50:21.44 --> 01:50:28.16
the team and I was I just kind of been more proud of of our guys going through some incredibly

1245
01:50:28.16 --> 01:50:33.68
difficult situations and and stepping up and getting the job done and and making the best of

1246
01:50:33.68 --> 01:50:41.12
a very bad situation doing what they need to do and it is it was just an honor it was an honor

1247
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:45.84
to serve with those guys it always be we had some horrific days I would do anything to trade those

1248
01:50:45.84 --> 01:50:54.16
days I do anything to trade places with with Marqulee and and with Ryan Job in Charitableton who gave

1249
01:50:54.16 --> 01:51:03.76
their lives but most of those days were the best days of my life and always will be and

1250
01:51:04.40 --> 01:51:11.20
it was just such an honor and a privilege to be part of that. Everyone damn it to get the Delta

1251
01:51:11.20 --> 01:51:14.56
Platoon commander on here and I'm gonna tell you right now you're gonna say the same thing about

1252
01:51:14.56 --> 01:51:21.44
his crew and the work that they did and the incredibly harsh environment that they went through

1253
01:51:21.44 --> 01:51:33.28
and the sustained combat operations that they conducted as well so thanks to all those guys

1254
01:51:33.28 --> 01:51:46.000
and thank you Jockel Willick for being our leader for training us for teaching us for inspiring us

1255
01:51:52.80 --> 01:52:00.32
for instilling in us this default aggressive mindset to go out on the battlefield into the

1256
01:52:00.32 --> 01:52:11.36
fray into the worst most dangerous areas and make a difference and win and none of that would have

1257
01:52:11.36 --> 01:52:22.88
been possible without your leadership and I'm proud of served with him and I could tell you that was

1258
01:52:22.88 --> 01:52:32.000
you read your speech earlier that speech was incredibly powerful it's something that

1259
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:40.40
resonated across the seal teams with me my generation of seals and every seal that I knew

1260
01:52:40.40 --> 01:52:48.08
are worked with about what that meant and it really captured so much of what we'd think

1261
01:52:48.08 --> 01:52:54.56
in a way that maybe other folks couldn't articulate it but it's certainly captured the message

1262
01:52:54.56 --> 01:53:01.84
of what seals should be doing the nature of or how we need to train how we need to prefer ourselves

1263
01:53:01.84 --> 01:53:06.80
and how we always need to remain there and when you gave that speech and I was honored to

1264
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.96
to give a speech as well at that retirement ceremony but as you pack your bags and retire to

1265
01:53:14.96 --> 01:53:20.24
and let the seal teams I remember thinking it's a sad day in the jockel of seal teams

1266
01:53:23.04 --> 01:53:30.08
and it really really was but you certainly left your mark on the seal teams not only for me

1267
01:53:30.08 --> 01:53:35.28
and all the guys from T-Roo's that we serve with but the generations of seals

1268
01:53:36.08 --> 01:53:40.40
that you trained that you passed on those leadership lessons out too so we thank you

1269
01:53:40.40 --> 01:53:51.60
I'm not dead yet but thanks thanks brother appreciate it it's awesome and yeah let's

1270
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.08
let's quit talking about each other and let's get some questions from the internet out of that sound

1271
01:53:59.60 --> 01:54:04.40
I'm with that echo by the way echo Charles is here today echo Charles yeah

1272
01:54:04.40 --> 01:54:10.000
hey guys how are you doing it? I'm going to be here with you all the good. Well come back. Yeah right on well

1273
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.80
I might as well read you guys some questions right yeah it's filled in my way fire away

1274
01:54:17.36 --> 01:54:23.76
all right cool first question I'm just going to direct these at both of you guys yeah

1275
01:54:23.76 --> 01:54:32.000
so jockel and life assuming someone would be a good seal officer would you suggest they go

1276
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.88
and listed first get experience then becoming officer would you suggest that?

1277
01:54:41.92 --> 01:54:47.28
or the other choice would be just go straight officer commission so right I guess we have both

1278
01:54:47.28 --> 01:54:52.56
of those examples here I was enlisted first way to win straight commission out of the

1279
01:54:52.56 --> 01:54:58.32
Naval Academy and I think we're probably going to say pretty much the same thing here in terms of

1280
01:55:02.88 --> 01:55:09.20
to me it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter where you get your commission from it

1281
01:55:09.20 --> 01:55:14.08
doesn't really matter if you get a commission it doesn't really matter there's guys in the

1282
01:55:14.08 --> 01:55:18.40
sealed teams there's enlisted senior leaders that are awesome examples there are awesome leaders

1283
01:55:18.40 --> 01:55:22.24
they change people's lives they have a huge impact on the battlefield there's obviously

1284
01:55:22.24 --> 01:55:29.92
officers to do the same thing I think you know I added incredibly lucky career and I had a great

1285
01:55:29.92 --> 01:55:37.12
career and I wouldn't change any part of it at all you know I was lucky enough to to be an

1286
01:55:37.12 --> 01:55:40.88
enlisted guy and do multiple deployments as an enlisted guy and then being an officer and do multiple

1287
01:55:40.88 --> 01:55:48.80
deployments as an officer and it was great and I wouldn't change any part of it and I know plenty of

1288
01:55:48.80 --> 01:55:53.04
guys that were officers in their whole career and they wouldn't change any of that and I know plenty

1289
01:55:53.04 --> 01:55:58.56
of guys that wouldn't list the guys that are whole career and they wouldn't change any of that so I think

1290
01:55:59.60 --> 01:56:05.68
the important thing is think about what piece of the puzzle you want to fit into the what you

1291
01:56:05.68 --> 01:56:15.20
really want your expertise and your job to be I don't really think life you wish you would have

1292
01:56:15.20 --> 01:56:21.84
done sometime as an e-dog as a sled dog for sure I mean look there's there's a part of me that

1293
01:56:21.84 --> 01:56:27.52
certainly always wishes that but look I think it's it's just a different it's a different job you're

1294
01:56:27.52 --> 01:56:33.12
going to always as an officer straight out of a commission source I had to lean on those I had to

1295
01:56:33.12 --> 01:56:37.76
lean on those chiefs I had to lean on those leading pedda officers those folks who had experience

1296
01:56:37.76 --> 01:56:42.000
who could help me and guide me and you know no matter who you are you're not going to have

1297
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.64
it all figured out and it's something that each I'll go you talk about often we talk about often

1298
01:56:46.64 --> 01:56:52.80
and when we work with companies so having run our leadership course what we call the junior officer

1299
01:56:52.80 --> 01:56:58.48
training course and every single seal officer that graduates from you know from every commissioning

1300
01:56:58.48 --> 01:57:03.28
source that graduates from the seal training pipeline goes through this course it's about a five week

1301
01:57:03.28 --> 01:57:08.24
course four week of classroom one week of a field training exercise where we're kind of out

1302
01:57:08.24 --> 01:57:13.12
of field and putting these guys through some some challenges and I I led that for two years I

1303
01:57:13.12 --> 01:57:20.56
instructed that course and I think we put on 130 something officers to that and the best officer

1304
01:57:21.76 --> 01:57:25.76
we had some great officers that went through that and probably the best officer I put through

1305
01:57:25.76 --> 01:57:31.44
was a prior-listed seal we had some officers that struggled and probably the they guy who struggled

1306
01:57:31.44 --> 01:57:36.56
the most was another prior-listed seal most of these guys had been prior-listed a commission officer

1307
01:57:36.56 --> 01:57:41.60
so it just goes to show you that you've every source whether it's a naval academy whether it's

1308
01:57:41.60 --> 01:57:46.24
prior-listed and going to see an animal program whether it's coming in through OCS officer

1309
01:57:46.24 --> 01:57:53.52
candidate school or or you know at universities you've got outstanding people that come out of

1310
01:57:53.52 --> 01:57:56.48
those those commissioning sources you got some people that aren't that good that come out of

1311
01:57:56.48 --> 01:58:04.000
those commission sources so it's about you and I think it's it's kind of immaterial. The physical part

1312
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.56
is pretty important right going in well of course you got to have some level of athleticism

1313
01:58:10.56 --> 01:58:17.84
but it's not the two of it's not it's just it just if you yes show up and be ready to make it through

1314
01:58:17.84 --> 01:58:23.84
the training but that's right that has next to nothing to do with your ability to lead people

1315
01:58:23.84 --> 01:58:27.76
of course you have to be physically fit you have to be able I mean there's no doubt you have to be

1316
01:58:27.76 --> 01:58:35.12
physically fit yeah that's like that's like a ground base no doubt about it so if you don't have

1317
01:58:35.12 --> 01:58:39.52
that you're not even close so everybody that is gonna be in a leadership position in the

1318
01:58:39.52 --> 01:58:45.20
seal teams is physically that period got you okay yeah for whatever reason thinking just to be a seal

1319
01:58:46.56 --> 01:58:52.64
okay cool I have next question Jacqueline Lath are your books principles universal

1320
01:58:52.64 --> 01:59:03.68
or only for us audience we work with audiences anywhere they applied anywhere I mean across

1321
01:59:03.68 --> 01:59:09.20
the world human beings in any kind of leadership capacity in any capacity and you know business

1322
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:14.08
or life and Jacqueline I've actually done a lot of work internationally as well so we've done

1323
01:59:14.08 --> 01:59:20.64
us spoken of groups in Europe I've worked with leadership training groups from China and

1324
01:59:20.64 --> 01:59:26.80
spoken of Canada I'm at across the world where leaders or leaders are dealing with the same

1325
01:59:26.80 --> 01:59:32.72
kind of problems same kind of issues this is not universal only applies to America to apply

1326
01:59:32.72 --> 01:59:39.44
anywhere yeah and what I found is in jockey always talk about like how it's relationships building

1327
01:59:39.44 --> 01:59:44.24
relationships up and down the chain of command so and really that relationships

1328
01:59:44.24 --> 01:59:52.000
theme is it's kind of everything in life where whether it's like your friends or your

1329
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.80
spouse has been alive or whatever in the teams or in business right so relationships

1330
01:59:58.80 --> 02:00:03.92
applied to everybody in the whole world no matter what culture you are otherwise so

1331
02:00:04.96 --> 02:00:09.84
each different type of person right where people who read your as book isn't

1332
02:00:09.84 --> 02:00:16.72
always going to be a military guy or a business guy but I just I just had a friend who sent

1333
02:00:16.72 --> 02:00:22.000
me a picture he was in Frankfurt, Germany walking through out of his hotel and there's a guy

1334
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:27.68
sitting in the lobby I like the coffee bar reading extreme ownership yeah and Germany so I mean

1335
02:00:27.68 --> 02:00:33.84
this is it's everywhere and I think leaders who seek to be better I mean this this

1336
02:00:33.84 --> 02:00:37.68
focus for them the principals in this book are for them and a lot of the companies who work with

1337
02:00:37.68 --> 02:00:43.44
they even if they're based in the US they have they have ties to other countries manufacturing

1338
02:00:43.44 --> 02:00:49.92
plants in Mexico or China or across the world and do business across the Atlantic Ocean

1339
02:00:49.92 --> 02:00:54.64
it's a very international interconnected world out there and and I mean there's most of the

1340
02:00:54.64 --> 02:01:00.80
companies who are working with these days have offices in South America or Asia or Europe and

1341
02:01:00.80 --> 02:01:08.16
are there kind of worldwide this could then this is gonna sound kind of crazy but this could easily be

1342
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:14.64
a relationship counseling guide as well well obviously if you take extreme ownership of your

1343
02:01:14.64 --> 02:01:20.56
relationship and you you realize where it could be you that could be the problem in your relationship yes

1344
02:01:21.36 --> 02:01:27.84
now that being said echo Charles this will not turn into a relationship

1345
02:01:27.84 --> 02:01:35.68
podcast not a married we're here to talk about war you're not gonna be Dr Laura yes it's not

1346
02:01:35.68 --> 02:01:52.000
happening here not happening good try good try I go okay thanks next question tell us a story about Buds

1347
02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:01.68
so so Buds is the basic seal training that you see on TV and that you see carrying people

1348
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:05.76
carrying logs on their heads and boats around and doing pushups and pullups and getting wet and

1349
02:02:05.76 --> 02:02:16.96
sandy and the reason that I don't talk about Buds a lot is because it's not it's a tiny, tiny

1350
02:02:16.96 --> 02:02:23.04
fraction of what the seal teams is all about and in fact when you get in the seal teams

1351
02:02:24.32 --> 02:02:32.56
you realize that Buds is nothing more than a screening process to weed out people don't really want to be

1352
02:02:32.56 --> 02:02:40.56
there but if you compare it to what you have to do once you get in the teams it's actually nothing

1353
02:02:40.56 --> 02:02:48.40
because there's no way that you can compare hey you got to go get in cold ocean water and

1354
02:02:48.40 --> 02:02:57.12
then roll around in the sand oh no then and I always think back to the the first time when I was

1355
02:02:57.12 --> 02:03:02.16
in the I was in at Camp Curricodor and I'm rolling out of the first major operation we were doing

1356
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:07.76
in the malob district of Armani and there's tires burning the street there's smoke you can

1357
02:03:07.76 --> 02:03:19.28
hear the gunfire getting wet and sandy and being cold is a joke compared to that so that's why

1358
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.80
the the whole Buds thing is is something that I just it's not that big of a deal and I think I think

1359
02:03:26.80 --> 02:03:32.000
some guys trying to turn it into a big deal especially if that was kind of a highlight of their

1360
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.84
career was going through seal training but if you were in the teams and you deployed overseas then

1361
02:03:37.84 --> 02:03:41.28
that shouldn't be the highlight of your career shouldn't be the highlight of your knowledge it shouldn't

1362
02:03:41.28 --> 02:03:48.56
be the highlight of your of your the the man test that people like to consider Buds not a man test

1363
02:03:49.28 --> 02:03:55.68
means you didn't quit being cold good job it's and to that point I think it's you know for those

1364
02:03:55.68 --> 02:04:01.60
folks it didn't really get tested and combat or didn't get a chance to go out on the battlefield

1365
02:04:01.60 --> 02:04:10.24
and experience the just incredible physical nature of combat and how difficult it is then you know

1366
02:04:10.24 --> 02:04:13.92
Buds is like everything so they talk about Buds all the time and so it's kind of this legendary

1367
02:04:13.92 --> 02:04:17.28
thing and it looks like it's a great training program it's been around for a long time it

1368
02:04:17.28 --> 02:04:21.76
it's screens out the people that don't have the characteristics as Jaco said that we think

1369
02:04:21.76 --> 02:04:26.000
we're going to be successful and it works and we should keep those standard time and we should push

1370
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.44
that I thought Buds was a pretty good time we had some great times in Buds I love the guys I

1371
02:04:29.44 --> 02:04:36.08
went through Buds with most of them and but it's it's gotten nothing on combat and you know it's

1372
02:04:36.08 --> 02:04:41.12
interesting that some of the the big political discussions today you know one of the one of them

1373
02:04:41.12 --> 02:04:45.84
is the integration of women into the seal teams and dispatch operations into infantry units

1374
02:04:45.84 --> 02:04:51.52
and everyone's always focused on you know well if they can be standards and if they're you know

1375
02:04:51.52 --> 02:04:56.40
if if they can make it through training then they should be they should be you know they should

1376
02:04:56.40 --> 02:05:00.000
be able to go out and serve right and they're focused on training and the people they're talking

1377
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.12
about training at the highest levels because they don't know what it's like to be in a real combat

1378
02:05:05.12 --> 02:05:10.96
and real combat is infinitely harder than the toughest I mean why are we talking about integrating

1379
02:05:10.96 --> 02:05:17.20
the NFL we got huge big strong guys that are smashing each other and yet that's you know maybe

1380
02:05:17.20 --> 02:05:22.48
you get a concussion maybe you tear your ACL maybe you break your your elbow you know or snap

1381
02:05:22.48 --> 02:05:27.44
up but snap your wrist you're not going to get killed very rarely to someone get killed in the

1382
02:05:27.44 --> 02:05:33.28
football game right and where in combat is is infinitely harder than that including more difficult

1383
02:05:33.28 --> 02:05:38.32
than that and so you know and and unlike a football game that's over and you know just a couple of

1384
02:05:38.32 --> 02:05:44.64
hours you're talking about something that can last weeks months even years and it's just the

1385
02:05:44.64 --> 02:05:49.52
physical nature of combat cannot be overstated it isn't incredibly difficult and when people are

1386
02:05:49.52 --> 02:05:55.20
shocked to hear that I can tell me some stories about bugs okay the bugs is care some

1387
02:05:55.20 --> 02:06:02.08
locks man don't don't quit okay I mean it's it's making through you know it's combat when you're

1388
02:06:03.12 --> 02:06:07.20
and you'll see it to guys who excelled in bugs because they're great athletes sometimes I'll go to

1389
02:06:07.20 --> 02:06:15.44
the battlefield and I remember the first time that an IED I saw an IED going off about a block away

1390
02:06:15.44 --> 02:06:19.28
for me and we were sitting on the rooftop and a sniper position as my first deployment before

1391
02:06:19.28 --> 02:06:24.48
Jocelyn I were working together and all of a sudden there's a hundred foot fireball that goes

1392
02:06:24.48 --> 02:06:30.56
up in the year I mean the blast wave hits me and just knocks me on my ass and frags just metal

1393
02:06:30.56 --> 02:06:36.16
fragments and sure to concrete and stuff just raining down all over the place from from a

1394
02:06:36.16 --> 02:06:44.72
block away you know from us and it was it was like damn that is that is not something I want to be

1395
02:06:44.72 --> 02:06:49.12
standing on around interviewing when you hit that thing and when you see something like that like just

1396
02:06:49.92 --> 02:06:54.32
the kinetic energy of a round coming in and just you know think of the biggest strongest guy

1397
02:06:54.32 --> 02:07:00.08
you can imagine with a sledgehammer smashing a wall next to you and you know multiply that time

1398
02:07:00.08 --> 02:07:04.72
seven or eight hundred rounds of man for a bell for a machine gun and I mean it's incredibly

1399
02:07:04.72 --> 02:07:10.64
difficult and dangerous and overwhelming and so you see some of the toughest guys that did well

1400
02:07:10.64 --> 02:07:17.68
buds are like oh not necessarily eager to go out in that and so it's a whole new level of difficulty

1401
02:07:17.68 --> 02:07:23.84
and it's it's just it can't be overstated so I think that it's it's the difficult as it

1402
02:07:23.84 --> 02:07:28.32
combat again just cannot be overstated people need to understand what the reality that is like

1403
02:07:28.32 --> 02:07:33.36
I think this idea that America is not going to we kind of dictate the nature of wars and you

1404
02:07:33.36 --> 02:07:37.92
know as we've been told the tide of wars receding and it's just not true as Jaco said in his

1405
02:07:37.92 --> 02:07:43.44
retirement speech the nature of war does not change and we're going to always have to fight

1406
02:07:43.44 --> 02:07:48.16
wars we're going to always have to be a difficult conflicts we don't get to choose that and so

1407
02:07:48.16 --> 02:07:53.36
we better be ready for those those difficulties in the late nineties we would hear that

1408
02:07:53.92 --> 02:08:00.96
from from senior leadership that we know look the direct action mission we're not going to be doing

1409
02:08:00.96 --> 02:08:05.04
these those anymore why would we do direct action mission we can send into the Tomahawk missile

1410
02:08:05.68 --> 02:08:11.12
and then oh why would we do a reconnaissance when we can send over a drone and why would we go

1411
02:08:11.12 --> 02:08:15.68
clear buildings house to house when we have technology that can put bombs right into buildings

1412
02:08:16.24 --> 02:08:20.96
so this idea that we're going to have the ground wars are over we need to move on to the next

1413
02:08:20.96 --> 02:08:29.20
phase of warfare and adapt to a new way of doing things and of course what was it eight years later

1414
02:08:29.20 --> 02:08:36.08
September 11th happened we spent 15 years in Afghanistan and whatever 10 years in Iraq that

1415
02:08:36.08 --> 02:08:42.72
on the ground doing those very missions that everyone thought were never to again so so yes the

1416
02:08:42.72 --> 02:08:46.48
nature of war does not change and it's not about technology either you know some of the guys

1417
02:08:46.48 --> 02:08:50.56
it don't make it through that training thing oh man if I just if I can just get through somehow

1418
02:08:50.56 --> 02:08:55.84
and I'll get all this cool gear and I'll have night vision and lasers and I'll be badass and it's like

1419
02:08:55.84 --> 02:09:00.32
it's not about that and and while we need to when you're an invested technology certainly and

1420
02:09:00.32 --> 02:09:06.16
a quick armuletary accordingly it's the people that matter it's leadership at all levels that matter

1421
02:09:06.16 --> 02:09:12.000
you know one of the one of my favorite quotes from the hero the Pacific War who was in charge of

1422
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.32
of the entire the the commander chief of of all forces US forces the Pacific I got him

1423
02:09:18.32 --> 02:09:26.56
chestroom nimmets fleet admiral chestroom nimmets good old boy from from central Texas and he said

1424
02:09:26.56 --> 02:09:33.52
our armament must be adequate to the needs but our faith is not primarily in these machines

1425
02:09:33.52 --> 02:09:38.32
of defense but in ourselves and I mean that's that's just exactly true and we've got to we've

1426
02:09:38.32 --> 02:09:44.16
got to always push those standards keep those standards high prepare people for the difficulties of

1427
02:09:44.16 --> 02:09:50.80
real actual combat and just how physically demanding it is and crushing it can be and and be

1428
02:09:50.80 --> 02:10:00.56
ready so then we can execute and we can win next next back to buds real quick that's how long

1429
02:10:00.56 --> 02:10:06.16
is bud six months right yeah but 27 weeks or so because a lot of things it's like you know hell

1430
02:10:06.16 --> 02:10:11.12
week right that's the time where you don't sleep that much or whatever I think some people think

1431
02:10:11.12 --> 02:10:18.24
that that's but you know like you just don't sleep ever and it's all hard they drown you and then

1432
02:10:18.24 --> 02:10:27.36
they bring you back to life yeah yeah not anyway next question aside from command what is your

1433
02:10:27.36 --> 02:10:32.96
favorite operator specialty machine gunner preacher corpsman et cetera thanks

1434
02:10:32.96 --> 02:10:41.52
well my personal preference was a radio man because I was a radio man when I was a young

1435
02:10:41.52 --> 02:10:46.56
enlisted guy I was standing on the quarter deck standing quarter deck watching this this

1436
02:10:46.56 --> 02:10:50.64
senior guy said to me what are you gonna do what are you gonna do to put you and I said I don't

1437
02:10:50.64 --> 02:10:53.92
know maybe a machine gunner because of course when you're a young kid you want to be a machine

1438
02:10:53.92 --> 02:10:58.48
no you know they're a machine gun and he said don't be a machine gunner you want to be a

1439
02:10:58.48 --> 02:11:04.24
radio man because they go on every operation I said okay fair enough when upstairs and volunteer

1440
02:11:04.24 --> 02:11:09.52
to be a radio man so they put this 30 pound radio on your back and carry the radio and it was very

1441
02:11:09.52 --> 02:11:17.04
lucky for me because that got me in the position where I was part of planning even as a very

1442
02:11:17.04 --> 02:11:21.60
junior guy I was part of the planning so I learned a lot about planning I was lucky because I

1443
02:11:21.60 --> 02:11:26.24
did shipboard deployments so then I was involved in planning and working with the Marine Corps

1444
02:11:26.24 --> 02:11:31.20
so I had some experience with big conventional units and I learned a lot then so I was always

1445
02:11:31.20 --> 02:11:39.52
very preferential to the radio man I thought it was the the most seribilly challenging job

1446
02:11:39.52 --> 02:11:47.68
now that being said let me tell you what I wanted my platoon's to think I wanted my platoon's to

1447
02:11:47.68 --> 02:11:54.000
think that each guy was the most important guy you know I wanted the the radio man to think

1448
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.80
that he was the most important I want the corner to think he was the most important because he was

1449
02:11:56.80 --> 02:11:59.76
going to save everybody I wanted the snipers to think they were most important they were going to

1450
02:11:59.76 --> 02:12:02.16
kill everybody I wanted the machine gunners to think they were the most important because they

1451
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:12.16
were going to lay down the fire and get us out so I was always a big supporter of all of them

1452
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:17.20
and you need them all because it's a team and and you get those people like oh this is more important

1453
02:12:17.20 --> 02:12:22.32
or this sort you know my job is the best and you know as we were talking about Chris and then

1454
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:26.56
the kind of portrayal in America sniper as the sniper and you've got to have that entire

1455
02:12:26.56 --> 02:12:29.28
element working together you've got to have those machine gunners you've got to have the

1456
02:12:29.28 --> 02:12:34.48
corpsman you've got to have the radio man who's passing position and you know where it's telling

1457
02:12:35.20 --> 02:12:40.56
telling friend these where you are so you can get help you know directing help in where you need it

1458
02:12:40.56 --> 02:12:44.48
you know and telling where the enemy is I mean all that stuff is absolutely critical I think as a

1459
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.08
as far as of favor it's specialty I like to shoot I like combat shooting combat rifle

1460
02:12:52.08 --> 02:12:55.44
pistol shooting has always been one of my favorite things to do I love that about the seal

1461
02:12:55.44 --> 02:13:00.96
teams you know training and combat rifle pistol shooting it you know moving and and hitting different

1462
02:13:00.96 --> 02:13:05.52
targets and shooting against steel targets and we go to these amazing ranges and it's super fun

1463
02:13:05.52 --> 02:13:14.48
and that being said that's not my job and that is that's a real realization you have to come to

1464
02:13:14.48 --> 02:13:18.72
as a leader is that my job is not to shoot and I got to be able to shoot because there are times

1465
02:13:18.72 --> 02:13:24.16
when I'm on the only guy can do that and I've got to be able to eliminate threat and I've got to be

1466
02:13:24.16 --> 02:13:29.60
able to do it accurately so I have to be able to do that just like everybody else but that's not

1467
02:13:29.60 --> 02:13:34.08
my job and I really learned that in our advanced training you know after buds there's another six

1468
02:13:34.08 --> 02:13:41.12
months of what we call steel qualification training and and one of my instructors you know as

1469
02:13:41.12 --> 02:13:45.84
Joaquin I often say like failure is sometimes the the is the best teacher often the best teacher

1470
02:13:45.84 --> 02:13:51.76
and I remember I was trying to shoot laid-down fire for my squad that we're under fire we're shooting

1471
02:13:51.76 --> 02:13:56.72
and I was actually trying to look around and I got a safety violation for that for like trying

1472
02:13:56.72 --> 02:14:00.16
to shoot rounds down range and trying to look around I was like guess what you can't do both

1473
02:14:01.20 --> 02:14:05.04
and I was like Roger that I should have gotten to say to you Valice's dangerous you never want to pull

1474
02:14:05.04 --> 02:14:08.24
the trigger in your weapon if you're not looking down your weapon control and where the

1475
02:14:08.24 --> 02:14:12.40
sights are and it was exactly what it should you know what should have happened but it was really

1476
02:14:12.40 --> 02:14:16.56
a sensation of me like I can't do both and why do I need to be shooting right now because

1477
02:14:16.56 --> 02:14:22.88
there's like eight other guys in the squad that are laying down fire and there's nobody else that's

1478
02:14:22.88 --> 02:14:27.12
looking around it's my job to high-port my weapon which means it's pulling at the sky and I

1479
02:14:27.12 --> 02:14:33.44
got to be looking around take a step back off the line Joaquin talks about detach and look around

1480
02:14:33.44 --> 02:14:37.92
so I'm making that call as Commander Control and if I'm not doing that nobody's doing it and so

1481
02:14:37.92 --> 02:14:42.56
leaders have to have to always be reckoned you have to understand the specialties you have to

1482
02:14:42.56 --> 02:14:48.08
understand how that stuff works what the capabilities and limitations of your guys are you know

1483
02:14:48.08 --> 02:14:54.08
of the departments and the team of the of the the assets that you have within your team but you

1484
02:14:54.08 --> 02:14:58.32
you don't you can't get sucked into the details you have to stand back and and and

1485
02:14:58.32 --> 02:15:08.48
and high-port you weapon to attach yourself and be the command control to make those big strategic decisions.

1486
02:15:08.48 --> 02:15:14.24
Next question how easy or difficult do you find it to delegate command and control?

1487
02:15:17.04 --> 02:15:18.08
It's really hard.

1488
02:15:18.08 --> 02:15:29.44
Until you are totally overwhelmed and guess what in combat you're going to be overwhelmed I mean you

1489
02:15:29.44 --> 02:15:35.04
can't do it all and it's and so anything in life is like this and so when you know you know

1490
02:15:35.04 --> 02:15:39.68
as a political commander I have got two junior officers who are my assistant with the commanders and

1491
02:15:39.68 --> 02:15:45.76
they've they don't have the experience I have it's their first opponent and my job is to train those

1492
02:15:45.76 --> 02:15:50.32
guys up and yet so I've got to give them responsibility and teach them how to be able to

1493
02:15:50.32 --> 02:15:55.84
commander and empower them and train them and mentor them I'm sure it was incredibly difficult

1494
02:15:55.84 --> 02:16:01.60
in fact I know it was incredibly up for Jaco who had a lot of experience done a lot of direct action

1495
02:16:01.60 --> 02:16:07.36
capture kill missions you know in Iraq to let me be a political commander go out and plan and

1496
02:16:07.36 --> 02:16:13.20
run that stuff but you have to do that and and so you have to train people we always talk about

1497
02:16:13.20 --> 02:16:16.56
how leaders have to work themselves out of a job that's what they should be doing they have you

1498
02:16:16.56 --> 02:16:22.08
have to do that so that you're training the people underneath you to grow and learn and take

1499
02:16:22.08 --> 02:16:26.08
on greater responsibility so that you can constantly look up and out of them you can grow

1500
02:16:26.08 --> 02:16:27.76
and learn and take on greater responsibility.

1501
02:16:29.52 --> 02:16:33.20
Yeah we talked about that a little bit too great I'm a delegation like

1502
02:16:33.20 --> 02:16:37.84
but in my case the creative field where if I'm going to have someone to take care of some stuff it's

1503
02:16:37.84 --> 02:16:43.28
hard to trust them to do it even though it's just in your own head because you're used to doing it

1504
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:48.72
this certain way and you even see that person doing it different even in that one way you're like

1505
02:16:48.72 --> 02:16:54.56
oh you get all you know uneasy about it but how you were talking about how you give them a certain

1506
02:16:54.56 --> 02:16:59.44
type of mission just like a you know you focus on that result and they know why they're doing it

1507
02:16:59.44 --> 02:17:03.44
here's what here's what I want you to go out there and do yeah go out there and do it and I can't

1508
02:17:03.44 --> 02:17:08.48
really get concerned on how you go out there and do it because you know in Ramadhi's a perfect example

1509
02:17:09.68 --> 02:17:13.60
you know life had his element that was going out but there was multiple other elements that

1510
02:17:13.60 --> 02:17:18.40
were going out in different parts of the city all the time and so I couldn't get in the weeds

1511
02:17:18.40 --> 02:17:21.76
on the waves so I couldn't get in the weeds on the other four or five element commanders that

1512
02:17:21.76 --> 02:17:28.40
were going out at certain times I mean all at the same times often and so I had to absolutely

1513
02:17:28.40 --> 02:17:35.60
let go of it and let these guys make it happen now the reason I was able to do that was

1514
02:17:35.60 --> 02:17:41.36
because we had built up trust I had put those guys through the wringer I had micro managed them

1515
02:17:41.36 --> 02:17:47.76
and and just been a total um I don't know how would you describe it I mean when we first started

1516
02:17:47.76 --> 02:17:52.24
work up I was really in the weeds with them like hey you know you kept tight reins you kept tight

1517
02:17:52.24 --> 02:17:56.88
reins out of the gates so look this is how this is how you need to do it I wasn't telling them what

1518
02:17:56.88 --> 02:18:01.28
to do but I was kept pushing them okay look what you did here think about this moving this direction

1519
02:18:01.28 --> 02:18:06.24
a little bit you can't do that right there and and it didn't take long where the guys like okay

1520
02:18:06.24 --> 02:18:11.92
they know what the expectations are they learn and now I now I don't have to worry about them so

1521
02:18:11.92 --> 02:18:14.96
now what can I worry about now I can start worried about decinflection now I can worry about

1522
02:18:14.96 --> 02:18:19.76
what the strategy is and you know for for bigger operations obviously when we were doing battalion

1523
02:18:19.76 --> 02:18:24.80
not battalion size operations obviously I could go out there and coordinate with the battalions

1524
02:18:24.80 --> 02:18:30.80
and and sometimes go out just to go out and make see how these guys are operating but I couldn't

1525
02:18:30.80 --> 02:18:34.72
go out to with five different guys that five different elements at the same time or even two

1526
02:18:34.72 --> 02:18:40.64
different elements at the same time and so you had to you have to build the trust and have the

1527
02:18:40.64 --> 02:18:50.24
confidence in your leadership and then give them the guidance the parameters the expectations

1528
02:18:50.24 --> 02:18:55.60
the goals make sure that's very clear and then you can let them go and you can let them run

1529
02:18:55.60 --> 02:19:02.56
and you can do your job and that's how we rolled and and Jocco actually I mean I I remember this

1530
02:19:02.56 --> 02:19:07.60
well because I knew that he wanted to be out on the battlefield with us on every single operation

1531
02:19:07.60 --> 02:19:12.80
I mean that's just where he would choose to be and yet he saw his place is listen I've got

1532
02:19:12.80 --> 02:19:16.80
man as these other elements and I remember a couple of times when I was like Jocco why don't

1533
02:19:16.80 --> 02:19:22.000
you want to come on this up with us like go on this type of watch with us and you were like no

1534
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.72
I can't do that and even though I knew he wanted to do it he knew he had to you know whether it was

1535
02:19:26.72 --> 02:19:31.04
approval plans for the other guys that were across the city or other elements that were out there

1536
02:19:31.04 --> 02:19:35.52
doing those things that he understood what his role was and realized that if he was out there with me

1537
02:19:35.52 --> 02:19:38.80
even though it had been fun he'd been getting gunned fights and and that was exactly where

1538
02:19:38.80 --> 02:19:42.16
he wanted to be that he wouldn't be able to provide that support to some of the other guys and what

1539
02:19:42.16 --> 02:19:47.60
they were doing and so so he couldn't do that and so it was I know that was incredible for you

1540
02:19:47.60 --> 02:19:52.48
and it was the reasons that Laf knows that is almost as soon as we got there

1541
02:19:53.28 --> 02:19:57.84
I said hey Laf I'm going out in the field for a little while you're gonna be

1542
02:19:57.84 --> 02:20:03.04
tasked commander and I left him back and went out the seal so awesome and yet it was one of those

1543
02:20:03.04 --> 02:20:09.68
things and I'll tell you that was that was actually one of the reasons why I did realize I couldn't

1544
02:20:09.68 --> 02:20:17.04
go out as much as I would want to because I had to maintain command and control so like I said

1545
02:20:17.04 --> 02:20:22.72
if it was a big operation where there was multiple units involved obviously I'd go out

1546
02:20:23.36 --> 02:20:27.44
sometimes I would go out just to go out because you have to you know I always talk about this you can't

1547
02:20:27.44 --> 02:20:31.04
be so far back in the rear that you don't know what the guys were doing through you know so I got

1548
02:20:31.04 --> 02:20:36.88
to just go out there just to go out go over the regular go on some operation to start go out into the

1549
02:20:36.88 --> 02:20:43.92
the one MC and go see what it's like up there but the fact of the matter is I had to be in the

1550
02:20:43.92 --> 02:20:48.32
position to command and control and I had to kind of learn that out of the gate when I left

1551
02:20:48.32 --> 02:20:55.44
Laf back at camp we had some significant operations happen and he got you know he got caught in the

1552
02:20:55.44 --> 02:21:01.12
firestorm and I you know I wasn't where I should have been so I had to type myself up a little bit

1553
02:21:01.12 --> 02:21:08.56
had to be more judicious in the way in the timing that I rolled out because it is hard to delegate

1554
02:21:08.56 --> 02:21:15.68
it's hard to delegate especially not only do you want to do it but there's an element of

1555
02:21:17.68 --> 02:21:23.92
you know pushing your kid out out out out out of the nest for the first time and you feel like

1556
02:21:25.04 --> 02:21:29.60
I want to be there and want to make sure that this goes good and not that I didn't trust these

1557
02:21:29.60 --> 02:21:34.000
guys not that they weren't perfectly fine on their own but no matter what these are your

1558
02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:40.000
bros these are your buddies and you want to be there to make sure to give them everything that you

1559
02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:45.20
can and so that's another little element of it that makes an art but you have no choice

1560
02:21:47.76 --> 02:21:54.32
cool next question how do you overcome the handcuffing boss a boss who isn't a leader and doesn't

1561
02:21:54.32 --> 02:22:02.64
trust his employees and he's a credit hog I know a little something about this jacco the credit

1562
02:22:02.64 --> 02:22:10.88
jacco the credit hog handcuffing us didn't trust us you know not true at all that jacco was

1563
02:22:10.88 --> 02:22:15.28
the opposite of that but this is listen the answer is pretty easy and this is something that

1564
02:22:15.28 --> 02:22:20.72
jacco taught me because I have a hard time with this like you know somebody that if I'm more

1565
02:22:20.72 --> 02:22:25.12
I'm one of those hard hit of guys that you know once they've just go accomplish the mission

1566
02:22:25.12 --> 02:22:29.76
default aggressive let's get it done and if someone's preventing me from doing that or asking

1567
02:22:29.76 --> 02:22:35.36
you a question that I think is even tangential I'm furious and frustrated at buy that and

1568
02:22:35.36 --> 02:22:40.40
jacco had to kind of tighten me up a few times on that as they listen throttle back and

1569
02:22:42.16 --> 02:22:46.32
you know you got really what that is it's just about putting your ego and check if you put your

1570
02:22:46.32 --> 02:22:54.000
ego and check and you make that boss look good who cares who gets the credit for it it's about

1571
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.40
the mission and whether or not you're accomplished the mission and guess what if you go out and

1572
02:22:58.40 --> 02:23:03.92
accomplish the mission the guy who's in charge is going to get the credit for regardless right so

1573
02:23:03.92 --> 02:23:08.16
that's okay and you can't worry about that and there's the more you accomplish that mission

1574
02:23:08.16 --> 02:23:14.40
the the credibility will be shared the the truth will be seen and and you're going to get you

1575
02:23:14.40 --> 02:23:19.44
will read the rewards your team will read the rewards from that regardless of whether it's the

1576
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:23.92
overbearing boss are not who's trying to be the credit hog and so you just can't worry about

1577
02:23:23.92 --> 02:23:28.16
that you have to put your ego and check you got to make your boss a good and you got to accomplish

1578
02:23:28.16 --> 02:23:36.08
the mission the hand-cuffing boss the way you overcome the hand-cuffing boss is by building

1579
02:23:37.04 --> 02:23:41.92
a relationship with them and I'll probably end up saying this on every podcast

1580
02:23:41.92 --> 02:23:47.04
hmm I had the same relationship with every boss I ever had whether they were

1581
02:23:47.68 --> 02:23:51.44
psychopathic micromanagers or whether they were tactical genius

1582
02:23:52.32 --> 02:23:57.60
las a fair leaders I had the same relationship with all of them which was they trusted me

1583
02:23:57.60 --> 02:24:01.84
they knew I was going to get the job done and they gave me what I needed that's what you're

1584
02:24:01.84 --> 02:24:08.24
trying to accomplish and some people as life just pointed out you have to work harder to achieve that

1585
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:14.16
some people are less trusting some people are more more paranoid you're going to end up having to

1586
02:24:14.16 --> 02:24:20.08
figure out these other human beings and that's what is hard about leadership especially up the

1587
02:24:20.08 --> 02:24:24.64
chain of command so you've got to figure out this puzzle of a human being and you've got to

1588
02:24:24.64 --> 02:24:31.04
get towards that strategic goal which is building a relationship of trust and once you have that

1589
02:24:31.04 --> 02:24:39.76
the cuffs are going to get unlocked now the other piece the credit hog that

1590
02:24:39.76 --> 02:24:48.72
life just talked about clearly clearly if you are saying to yourself he's taking all the credit and

1591
02:24:48.72 --> 02:24:58.08
I'm not getting mine that's the red flag that's the alert saying hey brother your ego is calling

1592
02:24:58.08 --> 02:25:03.04
you need to put it in check you like life said you want to make your boss look good there's nothing

1593
02:25:03.04 --> 02:25:08.16
you can do better to build trust with your boss than make him look good and give him all the credit

1594
02:25:08.80 --> 02:25:12.40
he's going to let you run those handcuffs are going to get a little looser every time you do that

1595
02:25:13.20 --> 02:25:18.16
never cared about who got credit are you kidding me are you kidding me we're going to put that

1596
02:25:18.16 --> 02:25:23.36
ahead of accomplishing the mission that we're here to a call to we're here to do no the credit doesn't

1597
02:25:23.36 --> 02:25:29.20
matter give the credit your boss deliver it to your boss on a platter on a silver platter

1598
02:25:29.20 --> 02:25:33.84
bringing that credit and walk away from it and say I'm going to go get you some more and those

1599
02:25:33.84 --> 02:25:43.12
cuffs are going to come off make it happen just next question what do you do where you know

1600
02:25:43.12 --> 02:25:50.48
in order is bad but if you don't fall in line the punishment will be terrible jacca you talked about this

1601
02:25:50.48 --> 02:25:56.32
when you were reading the maximum Napoleon and I think the quote was something like every

1602
02:25:56.32 --> 02:26:01.60
general and chief who in consequence of orders from his appears gives battle with a certain

1603
02:26:01.60 --> 02:26:09.20
of defeat of his army's ruin is culpable and I think that's exactly true and what that really

1604
02:26:09.20 --> 02:26:14.72
it means is extreme ownership you own it regardless and so you know in a military you've got the

1605
02:26:14.72 --> 02:26:21.20
uniform code of mist military justice which is the the legal framework that the military

1606
02:26:21.20 --> 02:26:29.68
falls underneath our laws our military justice system and you're you're obligated to not

1607
02:26:29.68 --> 02:26:35.52
follow a illegal order so if someone gives you an order to go execute prisoners or do something

1608
02:26:35.52 --> 02:26:42.32
that you shouldn't do you actually are legally obligated to not follow that and that following orders

1609
02:26:42.32 --> 02:26:48.000
like you know whether you're it didn't work in Nuremberg right for the SS guard to set people to

1610
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.64
their death to say always just following orders it's not that is not a defense so you have to

1611
02:26:52.64 --> 02:26:59.36
it's on you it's it's your responsibility and certainly under our own use to MJ it's it's on you

1612
02:26:59.36 --> 02:27:04.24
and I think in those kind of situations you you have to own that if it's truly bad if it's truly

1613
02:27:04.24 --> 02:27:09.44
catastrophic you have to be willing to take the punishment you want to punish me for that okay

1614
02:27:09.44 --> 02:27:13.04
cool you want to fire me why I'm not going to do that because I'm going to sleep better at

1615
02:27:13.04 --> 02:27:17.60
night knowing that I made the right decision I'm not going to go down this path that leads to

1616
02:27:17.60 --> 02:27:21.84
you know the destruction of our team that puts people in harm's way that puts you know that

1617
02:27:21.84 --> 02:27:26.96
causes people to do something that's unsafe and puts them in jeopardy and and you got to be

1618
02:27:26.96 --> 02:27:30.72
able to stare yourself with the mirror and that's most important oh you want to fire me for that okay

1619
02:27:30.72 --> 02:27:36.32
go I'll take that now some people you have to understand that you got to prioritize and there

1620
02:27:36.32 --> 02:27:41.52
are those people that are like over the top everything is like you're telling me to do this and

1621
02:27:41.52 --> 02:27:46.08
I don't agree with it and it's really not that big of a deal and one example I thought of

1622
02:27:47.36 --> 02:27:54.000
people are shocked to hear about what it's like going to war in today's world the administrative

1623
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.80
requirements that are on you the massive amount of paperwork that we had to do just to get a

1624
02:27:58.80 --> 02:28:04.24
approval for an operation all the things that we had to do better required on us and we're in the

1625
02:28:04.24 --> 02:28:09.52
middle of a war and guess what we bitched and cried about that all the time no one more than me

1626
02:28:09.52 --> 02:28:13.36
and jocke was probably sick and tired of hearing me about that and one of the things he sat right away

1627
02:28:13.36 --> 02:28:16.96
was hey guess what all these admin requirements they're putting on us even though we're in the

1628
02:28:16.96 --> 02:28:20.64
middle of a training right now they're asking us for this paperwork we're going to do them we're

1629
02:28:20.64 --> 02:28:26.000
going to do them all all of them yeah and one of the reasons that I did that was because I did not

1630
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:32.88
want higher headquarters to have anything to hold over me at all and further more guess what I was

1631
02:28:32.88 --> 02:28:38.88
doing I was building up myself a little relationship with the boss man because oh you want

1632
02:28:38.88 --> 02:28:43.44
admin stuff done no problem don't even worry about it we're going to build it up that's what we're

1633
02:28:43.44 --> 02:28:50.08
going to do and then there were times where the paperwork did cross the line and one of those situations

1634
02:28:52.32 --> 02:29:00.40
that we ran into was not really a paperwork situation but they had they wanted us to work with

1635
02:29:00.40 --> 02:29:07.04
Iraqi soldiers and talk about this before it's in the book the Iraqi soldiers are very unreliable

1636
02:29:07.04 --> 02:29:12.40
unmotivated can be disloyal don't have good training don't speak the same language as us don't have

1637
02:29:12.40 --> 02:29:17.60
good equipment I mean it's just a laundry list of reasons why you don't want to put your guys

1638
02:29:17.60 --> 02:29:25.76
lives in their hands well in Ramadi the fighting was horrible in 2006 in other areas of Iraq the

1639
02:29:25.76 --> 02:29:32.64
fighting had actually settled down well the command above us wanted us to work with Iraqi soldiers they

1640
02:29:32.64 --> 02:29:37.52
wanted all the special operations people to work with Iraqi soldiers so they actually and and the

1641
02:29:37.52 --> 02:29:43.36
all of the special operations people mostly were resistant to this and so everyone would kind of

1642
02:29:43.36 --> 02:29:48.80
skate by and figure out how to not do it I'm going to take I'm going to take a 25 man element of

1643
02:29:48.80 --> 02:29:54.08
US special operators and we'll take three Iraqis with us just to just to kind of check them off right

1644
02:29:54.08 --> 02:29:58.56
and you could see why they were doing this you know why because it's safer it's it's a way they're

1645
02:29:58.56 --> 02:30:02.96
okay we're doing what you said and they were actually using the term Iraqi face we're going to put

1646
02:30:02.96 --> 02:30:08.96
an Iraqi face on this mission which to them literally meant one face in subcases so we get told this

1647
02:30:08.96 --> 02:30:14.72
as well and if you you know if you read the book we'll talk we talk about the fact that yeah we were

1648
02:30:14.72 --> 02:30:20.80
definitely not pro taking Iraqis but we realized that if we didn't do that if we didn't get the

1649
02:30:20.80 --> 02:30:24.40
Iraqis out there fighting they were never going to learn how to fight and we were never

1650
02:30:24.40 --> 02:30:30.24
able to leave Iraq so we knew that something we had to do but then they went one step further

1651
02:30:30.24 --> 02:30:35.76
and they set up a ratio and I know this sounds crazy they set up a ratio and they said I think

1652
02:30:35.76 --> 02:30:40.40
it was for every one American soldier you have to have five Iraqi soldiers with you it was

1653
02:30:40.40 --> 02:30:49.36
some ratio like that some number and if you were out in some part of central Iraq outside of a

1654
02:30:49.36 --> 02:30:53.36
small town and you were doing some kind of a simple mission you could get away with that all day long

1655
02:30:54.40 --> 02:31:00.32
in Romadi wasn't happened that would have meant I would have been sending three or four seals

1656
02:31:00.96 --> 02:31:06.72
out with twenty something Iraqis and that means if there's a firefight you got three guys that are

1657
02:31:06.72 --> 02:31:12.08
alive both once you'll get hit who else is going to handle things it's a nightmare and so this order

1658
02:31:12.08 --> 02:31:19.92
came down and I just ran up the chain of commands said we can't do that and we're not going to do

1659
02:31:19.92 --> 02:31:25.04
that here is what we're taking we'll take as many Iraqis as appropriate but this is the minimum

1660
02:31:25.04 --> 02:31:30.08
force we're going to have every operation that we go on and so we set that standard and of course

1661
02:31:30.08 --> 02:31:38.24
and this is something I talk about a lot as well it was a sensible argument it made sense there

1662
02:31:38.24 --> 02:31:43.44
was obviously casualties on a regular basis in the Romadi there were fire fights every single day

1663
02:31:43.84 --> 02:31:48.56
the buttoon out in correct or their first twenty four missions in a row they got in a firefight

1664
02:31:48.56 --> 02:31:51.92
twenty four missions in a row they got in a firefight then they had one day where they didn't

1665
02:31:51.92 --> 02:31:55.36
and then the next day they did it again for another how were many missions so there were fire fights

1666
02:31:55.36 --> 02:32:01.44
happening on every mission so for us to be like okay yeah we'll just bring three seals and 15 Iraqi

1667
02:32:01.44 --> 02:32:06.16
soldiers it's a nightmare we're all going to get killed if we do that but one of the reasons that

1668
02:32:06.16 --> 02:32:09.76
that we were able to do that the jacco was able to get approval for that is because

1669
02:32:10.48 --> 02:32:14.16
all the little stuff that all you know other people it's like oh we don't want to do this

1670
02:32:14.16 --> 02:32:18.56
paperwork that's too much and they complain we had done that we had done those little things

1671
02:32:19.20 --> 02:32:22.96
yeah it's a pain for us yet do I want to do that of course not I'd rather be trying to do

1672
02:32:22.96 --> 02:32:27.20
another stuff but we're going to do it and so because jacco had had set that standard and we

1673
02:32:27.20 --> 02:32:31.28
made it happen then when we really push back for the stuff that really mattered which is what I was

1674
02:32:31.28 --> 02:32:36.32
talking about you got to prioritize an execute prioritize the stuff that really matters we were able

1675
02:32:36.32 --> 02:32:40.96
to get that approval guess what they didn't want to go out and get killed so is what we explained

1676
02:32:40.96 --> 02:32:44.40
it up the chain of like listen if we do that we're going to we're going to get a lot of guys

1677
02:32:44.40 --> 02:32:52.48
killed by doing that and I talk about this often the fact that leadership is aligned to the front

1678
02:32:52.48 --> 02:32:58.40
troops and if not then there's something drastic wrong but of course my boss is wanted me to

1679
02:32:58.40 --> 02:33:01.68
keep my guys safe and kill back guys and when the war of course they did it in an

1680
02:33:01.68 --> 02:33:08.24
in businesses of course the boss wants you to be profitable and keep your troops happy but be

1681
02:33:08.24 --> 02:33:14.08
profitable be ethical right that those are standard things and those are going to be aligned so if you

1682
02:33:14.08 --> 02:33:18.64
send up an idea up the chain of commander you get told to do something and you don't do it because

1683
02:33:18.64 --> 02:33:23.92
it's not going to help you be profitable why would your boss disagree with that it's not going to

1684
02:33:23.92 --> 02:33:33.76
happen so you have to have the the wherewithal to actually know when to say no and on the moral

1685
02:33:33.76 --> 02:33:39.68
and ethical things that Dave talked about those are clear cut those are clear cut if you're

1686
02:33:39.68 --> 02:33:45.68
getting told to do something that's illegal or ill moral then it is your duty and responsibility

1687
02:33:45.68 --> 02:34:02.56
to disobey that order and that's the way it is all right last question my team has missed our last

1688
02:34:02.56 --> 02:34:15.04
two deadlines I want to take ownership but I'm not sure how it's not what you preach it's what you

1689
02:34:15.04 --> 02:34:22.64
tolerate and look you have to you have to be effective we talk about there's two there's only

1690
02:34:22.64 --> 02:34:28.88
two measures that really that matter and that's effective and ineffective are you effective or

1691
02:34:28.88 --> 02:34:33.84
you accomplish in the mission and if you are figure out a way to become even more effective

1692
02:34:34.40 --> 02:34:38.40
if you're ineffective you're not accomplish in the mission then you got to figure it out you

1693
02:34:38.40 --> 02:34:44.64
got to take ownership of that you got to solve that problem so if your team is getting the job done

1694
02:34:46.24 --> 02:34:51.12
you can't tolerate less than that you have as a leader you have to drive those standards

1695
02:34:53.52 --> 02:34:59.92
I learned pretty early on that in the seal teams there's some strong personalities there

1696
02:35:01.68 --> 02:35:06.96
which is awesome that's one of the great things about the seal teams and there's always this tension

1697
02:35:06.96 --> 02:35:13.28
between people have there my we should do it this way we should do it this way we should train this

1698
02:35:13.28 --> 02:35:19.76
heart we should focus here there and and that's also be have some incredibly talented great

1699
02:35:19.76 --> 02:35:29.60
guys as we've just talked about but as a leader you have got to maintain the standards and

1700
02:35:29.60 --> 02:35:38.16
there's some there are standards that just cannot be compromised you've got to push hard you've

1701
02:35:38.16 --> 02:35:43.60
got to drive that performance you got to set the tone for that and if you don't do that no one's

1702
02:35:43.60 --> 02:35:50.16
going to do it so it's not what you preach it's not the words that you say it's not

1703
02:35:51.20 --> 02:35:56.88
the email that you sent it's not the banner that you created to put on the wall or the power

1704
02:35:56.88 --> 02:36:03.52
point slides that you built it's actually what you tolerate it's the performance that you see and if it's

1705
02:36:03.52 --> 02:36:08.96
substandard you got to push again and you get to push again you get to set that bar high

1706
02:36:10.56 --> 02:36:14.000
now that being said you can't drive your team in the ground you have to lead them

1707
02:36:16.32 --> 02:36:21.12
you can't be a slave driver you can't destroy your team you can't be overbearing

1708
02:36:21.12 --> 02:36:27.84
but for that those things that really matter pushing performance to the next level you have

1709
02:36:27.84 --> 02:36:34.96
got to set that standard and I think that's what makes truly the best military units the best

1710
02:36:34.96 --> 02:36:48.16
teams out there great it's now what you preach it's what you tolerate and with that one thing I

1711
02:36:48.16 --> 02:36:56.56
like to think about when when I hear about standards and what you're going to tolerate

1712
02:36:59.20 --> 02:37:08.72
don't just think about your team you got to think about yourself you got to think about raising

1713
02:37:08.72 --> 02:37:14.72
the bar on yourself you got to think about what you're going to tolerate from yourself

1714
02:37:14.72 --> 02:37:25.20
and how you can raise that bar and raise that standard and get better with everything you do

1715
02:37:25.20 --> 02:37:34.24
and thereby lead by example so that your team becomes the example

1716
02:37:34.24 --> 02:37:51.04
and with that I think will close it out that was a long haul on the podcast

1717
02:37:52.08 --> 02:37:58.000
