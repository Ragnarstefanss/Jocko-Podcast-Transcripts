[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 185.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willick.
[00:00:07] Good evening, Yacco.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:11] You get one shot and that's it.
[00:00:19] And in the end, you're going into the ground.
[00:00:26] Regardless of what you believe the afterlife consists of or what it doesn't consist of.
[00:00:34] As far as what you get to hold on to, once you leave here is nothing.
[00:00:43] And I implore people all the time to make it count.
[00:00:53] Because this is it.
[00:00:56] This is the finals.
[00:01:02] There are no re-do's.
[00:01:05] You can't hit the rewind button and even worse, you can't even hit the pause button.
[00:01:15] There's no way you can stop the clock from ticking.
[00:01:21] No possible way.
[00:01:22] The countdown is on.
[00:01:26] And the days are finite.
[00:01:31] You only get so many.
[00:01:37] And then it's over.
[00:01:42] So until them make them count, make all of them count.
[00:01:52] And on the podcast that I have a guest, a fellow frogman whom to the best of my knowledge
[00:01:59] is doing his best to make his days count.
[00:02:06] His name is Mitch Aguior.
[00:02:10] We just met each other.
[00:02:12] But like I said, he's a frogman.
[00:02:14] He likes to get to.
[00:02:16] He likes to get after it.
[00:02:17] So my guess is we should have some things to talk about.
[00:02:21] So Mitch, welcome to the podcast.
[00:02:23] Thanks for having me.
[00:02:25] Good to meet you.
[00:02:26] Yeah, good to meet you.
[00:02:27] It's 15 minutes ago.
[00:02:28] Yep.
[00:02:29] Kick you up at the airport.
[00:02:31] I think we linked up some way on social media.
[00:02:34] Correct.
[00:02:35] And you are in the AL doing some training.
[00:02:38] And so here you are.
[00:02:40] Cool.
[00:02:41] Where'd you grow up?
[00:02:42] I grew up in Virginia Beach.
[00:02:45] And then was there till about 11.
[00:02:48] Then moved to Maryland.
[00:02:50] And live with my dad was there till about 16.
[00:02:55] So wait, grew up in Virginia Beach parents in the military?
[00:02:57] Yep.
[00:02:58] My mom and dad were both in the Navy.
[00:03:00] Both in the Nav.
[00:03:01] That's right.
[00:03:02] Yeah.
[00:03:03] And my mom was an OS.
[00:03:06] My dad was a combat camera man with a dev group.
[00:03:10] OK, right on.
[00:03:12] And so then you were there until you were said you were 11?
[00:03:15] Yeah, I was in Virginia Beach till 11.
[00:03:18] They were divorced.
[00:03:19] And my dad had gotten out of the Navy and was living up in Maryland working at the Aberdeen
[00:03:24] Preving Ground.
[00:03:25] OK.
[00:03:26] And doing high speed photography there.
[00:03:27] And you know, film and tank rounds.
[00:03:31] And all kinds of cool explosives and stuff like that.
[00:03:34] And she had like a wicked cool job.
[00:03:36] He had a war at the school.
[00:03:37] A wicked cool job.
[00:03:39] And so I went up there and lived with him for a while.
[00:03:43] And then around 16 moved up to Ohio.
[00:03:48] My mom had moved up to Ohio.
[00:03:50] My stepdad was also in the Navy.
[00:03:53] And he had gotten out and they'd started a business up in Ohio.
[00:03:57] And I went and lived with her up there and finished out high school in Ohio.
[00:04:04] And then 10 to 11, 12 grade.
[00:04:07] And then joined the Navy from there.
[00:04:09] What was high school?
[00:04:11] What sports were you playing?
[00:04:12] I was playing football, basketball, the cross.
[00:04:16] And yeah.
[00:04:18] Was it?
[00:04:19] Were you good?
[00:04:20] I was a good athlete.
[00:04:22] And I was also into some sports that weren't at our school.
[00:04:28] I was on a arm wrestling team and a dodgeball team.
[00:04:32] A traveling dodgeball team.
[00:04:34] A traveling dodgeball team.
[00:04:36] It was by far my favorite.
[00:04:40] How many games would you play in dodgeball?
[00:04:44] No, in like a season.
[00:04:46] What's the season?
[00:04:47] The dodgeball season.
[00:04:49] Well, there's practice obviously.
[00:04:52] And if you take it serious like we did, we practiced like three times a week.
[00:04:58] And we would travel on the weekends for tournaments.
[00:05:02] What balls do you use?
[00:05:04] We were some leagues are different.
[00:05:07] But mainly it's those kick balls that you see.
[00:05:09] So like dead bread rubber ones?
[00:05:11] Yeah.
[00:05:12] How many people are on the team each side?
[00:05:15] There was like six or seven people per team.
[00:05:20] And then we had like a couple substitutes.
[00:05:23] You know.
[00:05:24] In case there was injuries.
[00:05:26] Yeah.
[00:05:27] Just like any other sport man.
[00:05:29] We had your first string.
[00:05:31] You know, starters.
[00:05:32] And then you.
[00:05:34] But you didn't wrestle.
[00:05:35] I did not wrestle.
[00:05:36] I didn't wrestle.
[00:05:38] I didn't wrestle.
[00:05:39] I didn't run across country.
[00:05:41] I didn't swim.
[00:05:42] I didn't do anything in high school that would be useful in my ongoing adventures.
[00:05:49] Well football basketball.
[00:05:51] I mean you're becoming an athlete.
[00:05:52] Yeah.
[00:05:53] Yeah.
[00:05:54] Just in general.
[00:05:56] I would say that competition mindset.
[00:06:01] You know.
[00:06:02] That.
[00:06:03] And just yeah.
[00:06:04] Being an athlete overall.
[00:06:05] That was always something that was just ingrained in me.
[00:06:10] You know, my both my mom and dad.
[00:06:12] They were really competitive.
[00:06:14] Like always had us in sports growing up my brother and I.
[00:06:18] And yeah.
[00:06:19] I always loved the competition side of things.
[00:06:23] And I actually like hate working out still to this day.
[00:06:27] Like I just don't really enjoy it.
[00:06:29] But if there's some sort of competition involved in it or you know, competitiveness, that's what I really like.
[00:06:37] Sure.
[00:06:38] So you get done with high school.
[00:06:41] And you.
[00:06:42] What makes you join the Navy?
[00:06:44] Honestly, I was I was just bored.
[00:06:47] I was living in Ohio.
[00:06:49] And it sucked there.
[00:06:51] There was just nothing there that I wanted.
[00:06:55] How long after you graduated high school did you join the Navy?
[00:06:58] A couple months.
[00:07:00] Did you did you go in the dive fairer program to be in the team?
[00:07:04] Or did you just want to be in just in the Navy?
[00:07:06] No.
[00:07:07] I originally.
[00:07:08] I mean, it.
[00:07:09] It wasn't planned out at all.
[00:07:11] I was I was working three different jobs.
[00:07:14] I was a.
[00:07:16] A.
[00:07:17] A roofer, which I really, really loved.
[00:07:20] I was a great job.
[00:07:22] And I worked at my my parents like they owned a Delhi slash convenience store kind of thing.
[00:07:29] I worked there and I was a lifeguard at Calhary.
[00:07:34] And I and I was a surf instructor.
[00:07:36] You said Calhary, I already know.
[00:07:38] It's an it's the world's largest indoor water park.
[00:07:41] Okay.
[00:07:42] And they have waves there.
[00:07:43] Yeah.
[00:07:44] I have a flow rider like a couple flow rider machines.
[00:07:47] Oh, the thing that she's wanted us to plastic.
[00:07:49] I was like, I'm not a type thing.
[00:07:50] Yeah, it creates an artificial wave.
[00:07:52] So I would.
[00:07:53] I was on the competition team and I would like give people lessons on how to ride that thing.
[00:07:59] So between that dodge ball.
[00:08:03] You kind of dialed in first of first of action.
[00:08:06] That's right.
[00:08:07] That's a good set up.
[00:08:08] So you recommend if someone wants to get a career special operations they focus on dodge ball.
[00:08:13] I'm wrestling and surfing.
[00:08:17] Awesome.
[00:08:18] For which I formed me, I first succeeded.
[00:08:20] I formed the first success.
[00:08:22] And so you're you're you're doing these jobs.
[00:08:25] And you're you're not having a good time with.
[00:08:28] Yeah, I was you know, not a very good.
[00:08:33] A studious.
[00:08:35] A student in high school.
[00:08:37] You know, high school is more of like a socialization.
[00:08:42] For me, like I really enjoyed going there to socialize.
[00:08:46] I enjoyed, you know, making friends.
[00:08:49] And I liked sports.
[00:08:51] And I was always I always loved working and making money.
[00:08:56] You know, like school is just kind of in the way.
[00:08:59] I'd kind of, you know, at the time I just had zero interest in any sort of classwork whatsoever.
[00:09:07] And I don't even understand how I somehow I graduated.
[00:09:14] And then, you know, I was like, yeah, I'm definitely going to do something in life.
[00:09:20] I don't know what.
[00:09:22] I'm assuming it'll be good though.
[00:09:24] You know, I just don't know what it is.
[00:09:26] And my teachers were kind of in that same mindset.
[00:09:30] They're, you know, half of them were just like,
[00:09:32] man, they're you're hopeless.
[00:09:35] Like there's you're just going to work at Burger King, whatever.
[00:09:38] And then the other half where just like, yeah, you're going to do something great.
[00:09:42] It's definitely not going to be in school.
[00:09:45] You know, who knows what it is.
[00:09:47] And I was just kind of in that, you know, glass half full.
[00:09:51] I was thinking the same thing.
[00:09:54] And I didn't know what it was honestly.
[00:09:56] Like I said, I was roofing.
[00:09:58] And I really loved roofing.
[00:10:01] But, you know, I was making minimal money.
[00:10:05] And I knew that that wasn't going to be it.
[00:10:09] So I was in the area.
[00:10:12] I knew that nothing around the area interested me.
[00:10:15] You know, there was nothing that I wanted to pursue around there.
[00:10:19] I was young.
[00:10:20] I was 18.
[00:10:22] You know, my my mom and dad were both and my stepdad were,
[00:10:26] were all in the Navy at points in their life.
[00:10:30] And, you know, had talked about the benefits of the military.
[00:10:33] My dad was always trying to get me to go in the military.
[00:10:36] And I just wasn't interested at all.
[00:10:39] And, yeah, that was never really even a consideration until quite literally,
[00:10:46] like, I was just bored.
[00:10:48] And the recruiter happened to walk in, catch me.
[00:10:51] And I was like, hey, you want to join the Navy?
[00:10:53] And I was like, sure, why not?
[00:10:55] And I was at first.
[00:10:58] I was going to do master dorms.
[00:11:01] Like I was like, you know, I've always had like a kind of respect for
[00:11:05] police.
[00:11:06] My grandfather's a police officer.
[00:11:09] My uncle's still a police officer.
[00:11:12] And that was something that I felt like, you know, was a courageous job and a helpful,
[00:11:18] useful one or whatever, you know, and I figured that I could,
[00:11:23] I've always been real protective as well.
[00:11:25] So like, I figured that job would kind of maybe be fitting for me.
[00:11:30] So he had asked me, you know, hey, yeah,
[00:11:34] you want to join the Navy?
[00:11:35] And I was like, okay, then I thought I'll go that route.
[00:11:39] And he was like, well, you look like you're a good shape.
[00:11:42] Do you want to be a seal?
[00:11:44] And I was like, there's a sneaky guy, you know?
[00:11:48] The only thing I knew about seals was from that commercial where the,
[00:11:54] where they're on the beach or it's a scene on the beach and the clouds roll over
[00:11:59] the moon.
[00:12:00] And then they had the full transparency.
[00:12:02] And so that's all I knew about Navy seals and I was like, oh,
[00:12:07] guys, what's the biggest?
[00:12:08] This was 2000 and seven.
[00:12:12] Jay, so you're watching the wars are going on all through high school.
[00:12:17] You're seeing all that stuff take place.
[00:12:19] Hmm.
[00:12:20] Well, 9-11-1-7th grade.
[00:12:22] Yeah.
[00:12:23] You were probably boots on drown or something like that.
[00:12:26] Well, I mean, I was, I was,
[00:12:29] um, yeah, I had been in for like 11 years at that point.
[00:12:33] So I joined in 90.
[00:12:34] So I was born in 80.
[00:12:36] Yeah.
[00:12:37] Yeah.
[00:12:37] So I'm a little bit older than you are, apparently.
[00:12:41] Yeah.
[00:12:42] So did you not, did you realize like,
[00:12:46] um, so this was your first kind of connection because for me,
[00:12:51] when I was growing up, like every time some kind of war event happened,
[00:12:56] I was all bummed out that I wasn't there because I was too young.
[00:13:01] And that's just the way I was always thinking about that.
[00:13:05] I was always into the military, but you were kind of like, not.
[00:13:08] I was the total opposite.
[00:13:09] Like I wanted nothing to do with the military.
[00:13:13] I wanted nothing to do with like,
[00:13:15] I'd never even thought about it.
[00:13:17] Um, my dad was just, you know, he was in and he was a combat
[00:13:20] cameraman with devgrip.
[00:13:22] So he was, you know, really involved with it.
[00:13:26] And anytime he would try and talk to me, I'm just like,
[00:13:29] I'm not interested.
[00:13:30] I'm not enjoying the fucking military.
[00:13:32] But you don't know what flip the switch.
[00:13:35] Just mega boredom.
[00:13:36] Yeah.
[00:13:37] Just, I just, you know,
[00:13:40] I was like, well, worst case scenario.
[00:13:44] I know, I don't know, I'm in for in the Navy for four years.
[00:13:47] I'll go see the world a little bit.
[00:13:49] I'll, you know, gain some life experience and worst case.
[00:13:53] I get out and I'm fucking 22.
[00:13:55] Yeah.
[00:13:55] Like, I'm not going to college.
[00:13:57] I know that, you know, high school is.
[00:14:00] I barely made it through that.
[00:14:02] And just not because I was stupid, just because I just.
[00:14:05] Man, wasn't your scene.
[00:14:07] Oh, my God.
[00:14:08] I'd rather do hell week 10 times in a row than right in essay.
[00:14:12] You know.
[00:14:13] So you get in the Navy and do you prepare at all?
[00:14:18] Like, for I had never run like further than a mile.
[00:14:23] And like, I, all my sport stuff was all sprinting.
[00:14:27] I mean, those dodgeballs are only, you know,
[00:14:29] dodgeball courts are small.
[00:14:31] Yeah, they're, they're short.
[00:14:32] So it's just, I was always a really fast sprinter.
[00:14:35] And that was kind of all I really cared about.
[00:14:39] I, I didn't even, I was also, I also, like,
[00:14:43] now looking back how stupid I was and just how dumb you are at eight.
[00:14:47] Like you think you really, like, no, when you're 18,
[00:14:50] you really, like, you're like, man, you know,
[00:14:53] you look back at when you're 10.
[00:14:55] They're like, man, I know so much.
[00:14:57] Yeah, I just compared to my seven year old self.
[00:15:00] I'm compared to my eight year old self.
[00:15:02] I didn't even know what I was doing.
[00:15:05] Now I'm a, I'm a man, you know, I know what, what life's about.
[00:15:08] But at that point, obviously, now I'm 30 looking back at that.
[00:15:12] I'm just like, man, you're so dumb.
[00:15:14] But I really was and just really in experience with life.
[00:15:18] I never, like I said, run really further than a mile.
[00:15:21] I didn't even understand, like, that people did that.
[00:15:24] I'd heard about, like, marathon's and stuff.
[00:15:27] But, you know, I remember when, you know, when I'd heard that,
[00:15:33] I had to run like a mile and a half for the PST.
[00:15:36] I was just like, what in the fuck?
[00:15:38] Like, why?
[00:15:39] And then, and then, like, I told my dad that I said,
[00:15:43] I told my dad that I signed up for the, the seal teams.
[00:15:46] And I was like, yeah, I'm going to be a seal.
[00:15:48] And he's just like, you have no idea what you just signed up for.
[00:15:52] I didn't even know I had to go to Buds.
[00:15:54] And then, so he, he, he, he, he, I was just like, yeah,
[00:15:59] I'm going to be a seal.
[00:16:00] What's wrong with that?
[00:16:01] And he, he bought me the two, three, four documentary.
[00:16:06] Mm-hmm.
[00:16:07] And we sat down and watched that.
[00:16:09] And I remember like, just watching the, the four mile time run.
[00:16:15] And I was just thinking like, is that even possible?
[00:16:18] Like, do people really do that?
[00:16:21] And I was just thinking like, Jesus Christ.
[00:16:24] Like, this is, I'm going to have to do all of this shit.
[00:16:27] Oh my God, I better start running.
[00:16:30] I better start training.
[00:16:31] So did you start running and training?
[00:16:33] Yeah, I mean, I, I, I went out and, you know,
[00:16:36] actually back up before I even saw that.
[00:16:39] The first, the first introduction I had to buzz was I,
[00:16:45] or Navy Seals in general.
[00:16:47] Once I signed the, like, a signed up, I was like,
[00:16:50] I'm going to be a Navy Seal.
[00:16:51] I better do some research.
[00:16:53] So it went out and got Navy Seals with Charlie Sheen.
[00:16:57] And I watched that.
[00:16:58] And that was my very first introduction to what Navy Seals were.
[00:17:02] And I was just like, man, looks pretty intense.
[00:17:05] Pretty cool though.
[00:17:07] And, you know, in the scene, in that movie,
[00:17:11] they say it's buds, but it's obviously not because it's like in the woods.
[00:17:15] And they're like, there's like grenades going off.
[00:17:18] And they're like, they're like, army crawling under barb wire.
[00:17:22] And he's like, this is buds, you know, like,
[00:17:24] it's just like this crazy scene or whatever.
[00:17:27] And I was just thinking like, damn, I got to go through all that.
[00:17:30] All right, better.
[00:17:31] So I went out and bought some fucking camo pants.
[00:17:34] I bought some boots, like just leather boots.
[00:17:37] And I went for a run down my street.
[00:17:43] And I remember it was like a mile.
[00:17:45] All right, I did, I was like, I have to run a mile and half.
[00:17:48] So I'm going to see how this goes.
[00:17:50] And I went and got those pants and got suited up.
[00:17:53] Fuck you.
[00:17:55] And I was just thinking, like, oh, man, this is going to be hard.
[00:18:00] But then then my dad got the two, three, four documentary.
[00:18:05] And then that was just like, oh, okay, I really just have no fucking idea what I just signed up for.
[00:18:10] And I was just thinking like, damn, that looks really hard.
[00:18:14] But I already told everyone that I was going to do this.
[00:18:17] And I was just kind of that, you know, that's one good thing about being a teen.
[00:18:22] And you're just young and dumb and stubborn.
[00:18:25] And luckily I used the, the good of that to get through, I guess.
[00:18:32] So you get, I was going to say, you know, my, my, my, my, my, my,
[00:18:37] Dive motivator was Mike Noss, you know, yes, I know who it is.
[00:18:42] I don't know personally about, well, he's, he's a old,
[00:18:45] Vietnam frogman, a plank owner at, at, at,
[00:18:49] a damn neck and he came in and he's a tall guy and he walks with like a kind of a big limp
[00:18:57] because he had like a hip replacement.
[00:18:59] He still swims like a fish.
[00:19:01] And he actually taught me how to do the side stroke the day before my PST.
[00:19:08] So it was like pretty steep learning curve.
[00:19:12] Yeah, that's, that is I always tell people not to make decisions
[00:19:17] when they're super emotional.
[00:19:19] And so I'm going to start adding, don't make decisions when you're super just bored.
[00:19:23] Yeah, you might end up at Buds.
[00:19:26] So you show up there, you show up to Buds.
[00:19:29] And you must, you know, obviously you made it through.
[00:19:33] Was already, what was it was tough for you and Buds?
[00:19:35] Running running was definitely, I mean, obviously that's like what you do the most of.
[00:19:41] And, um,
[00:19:43] man, it was just, I went from no running ever to running my ass off just everywhere.
[00:19:51] And, uh, and those time runs man, I was just fucking having a lot of conversations with Jesus.
[00:19:59] And those runs and just, you know, given it everything I fucking had just to make the cut off on those runs.
[00:20:07] And then, and then I, eventually I became like a pretty good runner just from doing it.
[00:20:11] And, um, but yeah, I was, I was for sure captain of the Goon Squad.
[00:20:17] And, uh, but luckily all those fucking dodgeball sprints were paying off in the Goon Squad.
[00:20:23] So it was, it was nice, uh, in the Goon Squad I felt comfortable.
[00:20:27] Did you get rolled for anything?
[00:20:29] Yes, I got rolled, um, uh, for some, I had real bad chance blunts from from the, the lack of running.
[00:20:37] Previous and, uh, but other, you know, got rolled, dealt with that.
[00:20:41] And, like I said, I picked up, like, from running so much.
[00:20:45] I just got good at it.
[00:20:47] And I was, like, young, so adapted well, I guess.
[00:20:51] Yeah, it's, it pays to be young in Buds.
[00:20:53] In my opinion.
[00:20:55] Yeah, oh.
[00:20:55] So I'm a physical perspective physically, yeah, for sure, with, like, dealing with, uh, overuse injuries.
[00:21:01] I mean, because you're definitely gonna, just,
[00:21:05] they're obviously just gonna fucking rem your ass.
[00:21:07] And then you have to get up and go.
[00:21:09] Yeah, I was talking to, uh, one of the medical guys there who came from, like, a sports environment,
[00:21:17] like the, I think the NFL.
[00:21:19] I think it was the NFL.
[00:21:21] And do you remember the, uh, I think it's Petella Femoral Syndrome?
[00:21:25] Did you ever know anyone that got that there?
[00:21:27] Anyways, there's a bunch of people that get this, this, this Petella Femoral Syndrome.
[00:21:31] You know, they're, and he said, yeah, at Buds,
[00:21:33] I would see 10 cases a week of Petella Femoral Syndrome.
[00:21:37] It's where your Petella, like, rub's against your, your, your,
[00:21:41] femur or something.
[00:21:43] And he said, in the NFL, you'd see, like, one of these,
[00:21:47] every year, maybe one a year.
[00:21:49] And so these guys that would come to Buds for,
[00:21:53] from a physical, what was athletic trainer perspective,
[00:21:57] would learn so much because they're just getting these,
[00:21:59] Matt, these bodies are just going through abuse,
[00:22:01] like, no other bodies.
[00:22:03] And so they see all those, all these common injuries that you get to
[00:22:05] knees, your, your shoulders, your back, like, that's what you go to
[00:22:09] Buds as an athletic trainer.
[00:22:11] You learn, and as a doctor, you learn so much about how to
[00:22:15] deal with these things because you see 10 times more than you would,
[00:22:19] or more than you would anywhere else.
[00:22:21] Yeah, I believe it.
[00:22:23] But I've also talked to people who say, like, I was young,
[00:22:27] so you go in two Buds.
[00:22:28] How old were you?
[00:22:29] And so you get the, you get the, you get the mind of,
[00:22:35] hey, I just do whatever they tell me to do, you know?
[00:22:37] But there's some people that say,
[00:22:39] I have told me they didn't think they were mature enough at 18 or 19
[00:22:43] to go through Buds.
[00:22:45] Um, I, for sure, was not, I don't want to say,
[00:22:49] I wasn't mature enough to go through because obviously I did,
[00:22:51] and I made it through.
[00:22:53] However, you say, like, what, or ask, like,
[00:22:55] what my biggest struggle at Buds was,
[00:22:57] was definitely my maturity.
[00:22:59] I mean, physically, like, physically it was running,
[00:23:01] like, just, I was never a long distance run,
[00:23:05] or obviously, um, sprinting.
[00:23:09] I was fast as fuck, sprinting,
[00:23:11] and I was really strong on the log and like the boats.
[00:23:15] The boats on heads was extremely surprising to me.
[00:23:19] I, like, I remember seeing it in the videos and thinking, like,
[00:23:23] okay, that's kind of weird, like, why are they running around boats on their
[00:23:25] heads?
[00:23:27] Like, and then, uh,
[00:23:29] I didn't think it was going to be painful because they're, like,
[00:23:33] inflatable to rubber boats or whatever,
[00:23:35] and then when they put that thing on your head,
[00:23:37] I was just like, Jesus Christ.
[00:23:39] This thing is smashing my fucking neck.
[00:23:41] Did the instructors jump around in the boats when you went through,
[00:23:45] because you stopped doing it at some point?
[00:23:47] They would, uh, like, some of the little guys would, like,
[00:23:49] jump and hang on the handles and, and shit like that when,
[00:23:53] when you're riding, but yeah, you definitely knew when they were on the boats,
[00:23:57] because they got a lot heavier, but...
[00:23:59] What they would do when I went through and they stopped doing this,
[00:24:02] which is a good thing.
[00:24:03] They would, they would be, like, the boats would be lined up,
[00:24:06] and we'd have them in head carry, and the instructors would be in, like,
[00:24:09] boat one and ride.
[00:24:11] And then they would just jump into boat two and then jump in boat three.
[00:24:14] And I remember hearing when they would did that to me,
[00:24:18] a couple of the times that they did it to me.
[00:24:20] I heard like this deep kind of...
[00:24:23] ...inside my neck.
[00:24:27] And I remember thinking, this is probably not good.
[00:24:30] And they stopped doing it thankfully, because that's not healthy.
[00:24:33] So you actually used to be like six, too.
[00:24:35] I don't know if I got shorter, but I definitely took some,
[00:24:39] took some damage.
[00:24:40] Took some damage for sure.
[00:24:42] Yeah, that was, that, the boats on heads was probably the most surprising thing
[00:24:47] to me of how, like I just wasn't expecting it to be that bad.
[00:24:52] And, but like the log PT, you know, I was all,
[00:24:56] I actually really enjoyed the log PT.
[00:24:58] I think probably because from roofing, you know,
[00:25:00] I was always carrying those 80 pound bundles of shingles
[00:25:03] up the ladder, and then like, I was the young guy on the crew,
[00:25:06] so I was the shingle bit for a few years.
[00:25:08] And, you know, everyone, everyone on my crew is in their 40s.
[00:25:12] So they, you know, I was the 15 year old when I came on the crew,
[00:25:16] and just a young, strong kid, they took full advantage of it,
[00:25:20] and just wherever they needed shingles on the roof,
[00:25:23] that's where I hauled them up.
[00:25:25] And so I was used to carrying, you know, that heavy load
[00:25:29] and stuff, I, like I said, I felt really good on that stuff.
[00:25:33] And mentally I was like,
[00:25:35] I just was super competitive.
[00:25:39] And that's what really got me through Buds,
[00:25:44] was just that sheer competitiveness.
[00:25:47] Where did the maturity level?
[00:25:49] Where could that have tripped you up?
[00:25:52] Were you like doing dumb stuff on the weekends where you...
[00:25:55] No, not really.
[00:25:57] Because I mean, I wasn't even old enough to go drink or anything like that.
[00:26:01] So it was more just kind of not understanding,
[00:26:07] well, one, like I was different.
[00:26:10] I was different than most people there,
[00:26:12] because like you said, you wanted to be in the military your whole life.
[00:26:16] And like you wanted to be a seal on Masumi.
[00:26:19] Did you?
[00:26:20] Yeah, I mean, as soon as I kind of figured out what the seal themes were.
[00:26:22] Yeah.
[00:26:23] Yeah.
[00:26:24] So like that, and just how you are,
[00:26:27] you're very disciplined, you're very, you know,
[00:26:29] you're very militant, I would say.
[00:26:31] And I would have concur.
[00:26:33] Yeah.
[00:26:34] I was like more of like a wild, like free spirit kind of,
[00:26:40] you know, kid growing up.
[00:26:42] And I was not militant at all.
[00:26:46] And so, and I also like, getting through bootcamp was difficult for me
[00:26:53] because of that as well.
[00:26:55] You know, just like, I'm like, why, why?
[00:26:58] My question was like, why do we have to...
[00:27:01] Make our...
[00:27:02] Make our...
[00:27:03] We're literally spent all day undoing our bed and remaking it.
[00:27:08] I was like, I... What the fuck?
[00:27:10] This is the point of this.
[00:27:11] Like, it's such a waste of time.
[00:27:13] And, you know, obviously it's all for a reason and design,
[00:27:16] but I just... I couldn't wrap my head around it.
[00:27:18] So that just lack of military bearing and lack of maturity and understanding,
[00:27:23] like why things are the way they are and, you know,
[00:27:26] the whole military structure of just...
[00:27:28] You just do it and, you know, questions, stuff like that.
[00:27:31] You know, that was probably...
[00:27:34] My biggest hang up, you know, just...
[00:27:37] I was different than everyone I was young.
[00:27:39] I was... I don't know.
[00:27:41] I... I didn't want to be a seal my whole life.
[00:27:45] You know, some of these people, like, this is like their dream
[00:27:47] and they've been training for it for whatever.
[00:27:49] And I'm just kind of here showing up and guys are quitting and...
[00:27:53] And I'm not.
[00:27:55] And, you know, and, you know, and, like, physically I was doing, like,
[00:27:58] a lot better than something that I've been doing.
[00:28:00] And, you know, and, like, physically I was doing, like, a lot better than some guys
[00:28:04] who, like I said, it was kind of just like,
[00:28:07] wow, I'm just here whatever doing this.
[00:28:09] And other guys that's like, this is everything to me.
[00:28:12] And, you know, so...
[00:28:15] It's like, I...
[00:28:17] Jack, so you get done with Buds and you show up in where do you go?
[00:28:22] Team 10?
[00:28:23] Team 10, yep.
[00:28:24] Right on. And then, well, how was that?
[00:28:26] Checking into Team 10.
[00:28:28] It was... it was cool, but by that point, you know,
[00:28:31] I'd kind of, like, uh...
[00:28:34] Obviously, I was like, alright, I'm a seal now and...
[00:28:37] and I had been in the... in the pipeline for a while
[00:28:40] and kind of getting in the flow of things and the military
[00:28:45] and stuff like that.
[00:28:47] But, uh...
[00:28:48] Jack, go... I was super excited to check in to Team 10.
[00:28:52] Um, and I...
[00:28:54] Originally, I was going to go to Team 5.
[00:28:56] And then, I... I told my family, you know, that I got orders to 5.
[00:29:00] And they were all kind of bummed out because they...
[00:29:02] They won it. They're all in the East Coast.
[00:29:04] And, um... they were like, oh man, you know, we were hoping you'd come to the East Coast.
[00:29:08] And I was like, uh... okay, I'll go to the East Coast.
[00:29:10] And I thought it was, like, kind of cool too, because...
[00:29:14] It felt like a... like a new... like a new chapter
[00:29:19] because, like, you know, the...
[00:29:21] the... Seal Team 1, 3 and 5, or 7 or right by the Buds compound.
[00:29:26] So it was, like, you know, I'd been there and been in the scene for the last two years or whatever it was.
[00:29:33] And it was... it was cool. It felt cool to, like, go across the country and, like, check into a team.
[00:29:39] And, you know, I just felt like, like, this is it. This is real deal.
[00:29:43] So it was super cool. I felt... felt good.
[00:29:46] Um... my trip was awesome.
[00:29:48] And... and... What was your job in your first poll, too?
[00:29:52] I was a heavy gunner for sure.
[00:29:54] A-dum.
[00:29:57] A knuckle dragger.
[00:29:58] Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:59] Yeah.
[00:29:59] That's a classic new guy.
[00:30:02] Strong new guy. Guess what?
[00:30:05] Yeah.
[00:30:05] From the pig.
[00:30:06] Your big, strong new guy? Got something for you.
[00:30:08] And I loved it.
[00:30:09] Yeah.
[00:30:10] I am... I am braced at, I didn't think it was like a bad thing, you know.
[00:30:14] And what year is this now?
[00:30:16] 2009.
[00:30:18] Okay. So you went straight to the... to the Mark 48.
[00:30:21] No end of 60 for you.
[00:30:22] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:23] That's... that's... that's nice.
[00:30:25] Yeah. We shot 60s and stuff, but no...
[00:30:28] What, like, a fam shoot with 60s or something?
[00:30:30] Yeah. And there were 60s on, like, homies and stuff like that,
[00:30:34] going through, uh, vehicle stuff.
[00:30:36] So there were still a little bit of transition taking place.
[00:30:39] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:40] So you're a pig gunner, your first poll tune.
[00:30:42] How was your first work-up?
[00:30:44] It was awesome.
[00:30:46] It was definitely a good time.
[00:30:48] Got what surprised you about, like, going through work-up,
[00:30:52] being in a seal-potir.
[00:30:53] What was different than what you thought it was.
[00:30:55] What was different from how it was for Charlie Sheen?
[00:30:59] Mm-hmm.
[00:31:01] You know?
[00:31:03] It was... it was a lot like the movie.
[00:31:08] I'm just kidding.
[00:31:10] It was... it was great, man.
[00:31:12] I thought it was a lot of fun.
[00:31:14] We got to travel...
[00:31:16] Travel the country.
[00:31:18] That was a cool thing too about the East Coast.
[00:31:20] Um, the training sites were kind of all over all over,
[00:31:24] versus the West Coast.
[00:31:26] It was kind of like the same song and dance, like,
[00:31:28] Nyland and...
[00:31:30] and, uh...
[00:31:31] Let's see other one.
[00:31:33] Yeah.
[00:31:34] You know, in the training,
[00:31:36] the training's like all the same sites.
[00:31:38] And, uh, so, going to the East Coast, I got to see a bunch of new places.
[00:31:43] And that was cool to me, just kind of seeing the world.
[00:31:46] Um, and the... the brotherhood of, like,
[00:31:50] being in the troops and...
[00:31:52] and stuff, and you're rolling around as a team.
[00:31:55] I thought that that was really cool.
[00:31:57] Um...
[00:31:59] Was there anything that was more challenging?
[00:32:03] Like, you know, some new guys they have a hard time in their first platoon,
[00:32:06] whatever, with land warfare, they have a hard time with CQC,
[00:32:09] they'll have a hard time with...
[00:32:10] you know, whatever.
[00:32:11] Sometimes it's like not easy.
[00:32:13] Sometimes, you know, you get a guy that can't dive very well.
[00:32:16] Or whatever.
[00:32:17] Was there anything that was any skill set that was hard for you?
[00:32:20] Or did you pretty much...
[00:32:21] Which is...
[00:32:22] I would say, most guys coming out of buds and SQT,
[00:32:25] like most of them are fine.
[00:32:27] Like most of them get...
[00:32:28] They pick things up pretty quick.
[00:32:30] You know, they made it through all that crap.
[00:32:32] They made it through SQT where you're getting
[00:32:35] screened, right?
[00:32:37] Again, some of the most that I'm but still you'd still get guys
[00:32:40] showing up a platoon that, you know, they wouldn't be comfortable with this,
[00:32:43] or they wouldn't be graded at that.
[00:32:44] Was there anything that was tough for you?
[00:32:46] Uh, I would say, like everything was tough.
[00:32:51] I...
[00:32:52] I wasn't a master at anything other than my pig, you know.
[00:32:57] And...
[00:32:58] So everything was...
[00:33:00] Was somewhat challenging for me,
[00:33:02] but I also didn't really struggle with anything too much
[00:33:06] other than like my maturity.
[00:33:08] Like that, you know, I was...
[00:33:10] I checked into a seal team before I could even go into a bar.
[00:33:14] You know, and...
[00:33:16] I didn't go to college or anything like that.
[00:33:18] So...
[00:33:19] I was...
[00:33:20] I was a 20 year old in a seal team.
[00:33:23] Yeah.
[00:33:24] You know.
[00:33:25] Um...
[00:33:26] So...
[00:33:27] Yes, I had been through a lot as far as like buds
[00:33:31] and SQT and, you know, that kind of forces you to grow up
[00:33:36] to an extent.
[00:33:38] But seals like to party too.
[00:33:41] And...
[00:33:42] And I kind of...
[00:33:43] That was probably my biggest challenge,
[00:33:45] was just my maturity and just kind of...
[00:33:48] learning when to...
[00:33:50] to lock on and...
[00:33:53] And, you know, when it was time to like...
[00:33:56] chill out.
[00:33:57] Did you ever get caught?
[00:33:58] Did you ever get in trouble?
[00:33:59] Did you ever get arrested?
[00:34:00] I did.
[00:34:01] I did get arrested and...
[00:34:02] Not in my new guy, Platoon.
[00:34:03] I got arrested in my...
[00:34:05] And when I was in my second Platoon.
[00:34:08] I got into a bar fight.
[00:34:11] Um...
[00:34:12] These guys...
[00:34:13] It was actually three...
[00:34:14] Three dudes had just started...
[00:34:17] mouth and mouth to one of my...
[00:34:19] Platoon members.
[00:34:20] wife.
[00:34:21] It was him and I and my girlfriend at the time.
[00:34:25] And his girlfriend at the time.
[00:34:27] Now we're wife and...
[00:34:30] We're coming out of the bar and they just...
[00:34:32] I had had a couple of drinks and they had come over and said some disrespectful shit to them.
[00:34:37] And...
[00:34:37] You know, I...
[00:34:38] I just...
[00:34:39] Was feeling froggy a little bit.
[00:34:41] And...
[00:34:42] Didn't let it slide.
[00:34:44] And...
[00:34:45] And it up...
[00:34:46] Wip in their ass and beat up three people outside of a bar and got arrested.
[00:34:50] Mm-hmm.
[00:34:51] But your first position you...
[00:34:52] You managed to keep your nose clean.
[00:34:54] Yeah.
[00:34:55] As far as the actual log out...
[00:34:57] The actual law enforcement goes.
[00:34:59] Yeah.
[00:35:00] I know.
[00:35:01] And then where was that?
[00:35:02] So you did your work up.
[00:35:03] Where did you guys go on deployment to?
[00:35:05] Your first deployment?
[00:35:06] Afghanistan.
[00:35:07] And when you were going to Afghanistan...
[00:35:11] Where you going...
[00:35:13] Did you go as a whole troop to Afghanistan?
[00:35:15] Uh...
[00:35:16] Yep.
[00:35:16] Yeah.
[00:35:17] All three of our...
[00:35:18] Platoon's went.
[00:35:19] Yeah.
[00:35:20] It was...
[00:35:20] It was kind of an interesting...
[00:35:22] thing because it was in 2011 and I don't know if you said you got out in 2010.
[00:35:32] I did, yeah.
[00:35:33] Well, yeah, I'm sure you heard about the, they wanted us to somehow get on the army
[00:35:41] schedule and so it was us and team 7 and we ended up basically doing two deployments back
[00:35:50] to back and got synced up with the army or something like that.
[00:35:56] I don't know all the, you know, mumbo jumbo that actually took place but or why we did
[00:36:05] it but they told us kind of right before it was like two months before we left.
[00:36:10] They were like, hey, just kidding you guys are going to go to Afghanistan and we're going
[00:36:14] to need you to stay there for basically a year.
[00:36:21] We went there and it was an interesting deployment for sure because my platoon, we were
[00:36:34] the furthest outpost from any major base in Afghanistan and you know, we're basically
[00:36:43] rough in it the whole time we were out there.
[00:36:45] Did you guys take over an outpost somewhere or did you guys establish one?
[00:36:49] We took one over that had just been established like literally a couple months ago.
[00:36:55] You know, so there was, there was nothing there.
[00:36:57] We were sleeping in tents still, no running water, no, nothing like that.
[00:37:03] And then I think around month 7 or 8 of our deployment, we packed up and went 15
[00:37:13] miles north and set up a new site.
[00:37:17] So it was literally just fucking rough in it the whole time, you know, air drop in our
[00:37:24] food in and no running water the whole time.
[00:37:29] And what what type of ops were you doing?
[00:37:33] We were we were doing all kinds of stuff and I was lucky enough to kind of, we got to,
[00:37:39] they shifted our guys around too.
[00:37:41] So like we got to all kind of experience different things because we all had a different
[00:37:46] kind of mission set and different, we were all all three of our platoon were in different
[00:37:52] areas of Afghanistan.
[00:37:54] So I got to kind of do a lot of everything.
[00:37:58] So were you guys going out on patrol from your, from your forward operating base?
[00:38:02] Was that yeah and pretty much daily?
[00:38:06] And you were interacting with a local populist type thing?
[00:38:09] Yep, yeah.
[00:38:10] Trying to establish relationships.
[00:38:12] Yep, we did that for a little while that was a really dumb.
[00:38:19] That you didn't because you didn't feel like you made any progress, didn't make any connections.
[00:38:24] Yeah, I mean in my opinion, I just thought it was like kind of a waste of time.
[00:38:30] And I just, I just felt like we could have been doing a lot more stuff or better stuff
[00:38:37] for their time and training and all that.
[00:38:40] And it was just like a super dangerous area to be in, you know, it was in Helman.
[00:38:48] And we basically just lived in a fucking minefield, you know.
[00:38:52] And it was just IEDs everywhere, just as a constant threat.
[00:38:57] So, you know, and we were going on these long patrols every day and all these, all these
[00:39:05] stops we were doing and hitting these villages that were just riddled with IEDs everywhere
[00:39:12] and, you know, getting contacted, you know, you're basically just stick out like a sore
[00:39:18] thumb there, you know.
[00:39:20] So, I mean, you know how it is overseas.
[00:39:24] I didn't feel real comfortable with that.
[00:39:28] Like, and it sucked, being in a minefield, like just every step, just please don't blow,
[00:39:34] please don't blow, please don't blow up, please don't blow up.
[00:39:36] Yeah, for a year.
[00:39:38] Yeah.
[00:39:39] Did you guys, did you guys hit any IEDs?
[00:39:41] Uh, yeah.
[00:39:42] Yeah, we encountered a couple IEDs and, um, so, I don't know, shitty.
[00:39:53] And the enemy, did you have a feel for who was bad and who was good when you'd go out?
[00:40:03] No, definitely not.
[00:40:05] There was, I mean, because like literally there was, there was times where, you know,
[00:40:11] we'd be in the village, fucking shaking hands with people and then, you know, on the way
[00:40:16] out, get contacted, getting a firefight, and then fucking go back and look and, oh, it's
[00:40:23] the same guys that we were just shaking hands with that, or fucking dead, you know.
[00:40:28] So it was hard to, it was really weird to like get ramped up and everything as these,
[00:40:42] like, you get in this mindset, this warrior mindset, you know, that you're going to war
[00:40:48] and you're going to this fucking land where everyone is, you know, your enemy and bubble
[00:40:54] blah and then it's like, oh, just kidding, let's try to help some of these people or whatever.
[00:40:59] And the, you know, the good and use like, okay, yeah, I want to, I want to help people
[00:41:05] and stuff like that and, and do what I can, um, to help these people out and, and if they're
[00:41:12] getting like bully, essentially by the, by the Taliban or whatever, like, that's not cool,
[00:41:17] but I just felt like it was, it was really weird to be there and go there with that mindset
[00:41:28] and then have to fucking like try to help people and then when you try to help people, they
[00:41:31] don't want your help and, you know, and they fucking shoot at you and, and shit like that.
[00:41:36] So it's like, and then you're expected to like go out and try and help these people again.
[00:41:42] And it's, I don't know, it was just like a weird, so weird dynamic.
[00:41:49] And would you go, when you said you would move positions, where you go in from like, would
[00:41:53] you like switch platoons and go to a different operating base?
[00:41:56] Yeah.
[00:41:57] And then you'd spend some time there with them and then do operations with them and then
[00:42:03] after a little while go to a different one as well.
[00:42:05] Yeah, yeah, we, we rotated our guy, all of our guys just to, so we can all get, you know,
[00:42:12] experience doing other things like working with the commandos or, you know, training the fit,
[00:42:19] training the fit or doing the VSO stuff.
[00:42:23] And yeah, it was cool.
[00:42:26] I enjoyed that just because it broke up the monotony of every day, you know, going on patrols,
[00:42:32] doing the same thing, seeing the same places or whatever and dealing with the same threats.
[00:42:37] It just, it keeps you kind of from getting complacent.
[00:42:43] I felt like, so I was especially for the 11 month or yeah.
[00:42:47] So I was definitely happy to move and do new things and work.
[00:42:52] And like, and it was cool, too, because on the base that we were at in Afghanistan, it was literally
[00:42:58] like 100 yards by 100 yards.
[00:43:01] That was, that was like, our camp.
[00:43:04] It was like being imprisoned, you know, but worse.
[00:43:07] And like, because we're getting shot at, too.
[00:43:10] And like, if you, when you go outside to go get your fucking food that they air drop in,
[00:43:17] you know, you're worried about stepping on IDs, like we found ID's literally right outside of
[00:43:22] our compound, you know.
[00:43:24] So it was constant threat always.
[00:43:26] And, uh, and like I said, like going to get our air drop, it was just a lot of work, too,
[00:43:33] because not only it was like we were sealed bees, you know, we had to like build our,
[00:43:39] we had to like build our camp and also like all the stuff that came with that, like,
[00:43:45] going and getting our, our supplies that would air drop in and, and being out there,
[00:43:51] you know, you only get ring routes and stuff, you only get air drops every once in a while.
[00:43:56] And, uh, so when, when shit would come in, it was like all hands go work on this and then
[00:44:04] also you got a prep your shit and get ready for the, the op tonight or tomorrow or whatever.
[00:44:09] And, um, and I remember just, I have a video of one of our big air drops coming in
[00:44:18] and, uh, you just see like three or four palettes just burn in and just explode.
[00:44:24] And, you know, it's like always, like all the water bottle palettes are fine,
[00:44:30] but it's that one with like the goodies, you know, it's like, oh man, you know, that's the one
[00:44:35] that burned in and it just fucking hits the ground explodes and you see like all the rippets or
[00:44:41] something, you know, something that people are looking forward to just explode and you're like,
[00:44:45] fuck. I don't know, I just accepted that. This is my life. So whatever, I wasn't, I wasn't thinking
[00:44:52] about the time too much and then, um, I just, you get into a rhythm, you know, and we got to,
[00:45:00] we got to go home for R&R, that was cool. Took a little break, but it was like,
[00:45:04] bittersweet, you know, go home for fucking two weeks and like, oh, I've just been playing in this
[00:45:09] mine field where everyone's trying to kill me for the last six months and come home for two
[00:45:13] weeks and like to normal see and you're just like, you know, literally just fly straight from there,
[00:45:18] know decompression or anything and then now you're back in normal society with your family and
[00:45:24] by the way, you're leaving in 11 days to go back. Yeah, and then don't get comfortable because
[00:45:30] we're going right back over there. So that was like kind of like, it was bittersweet and uh,
[00:45:36] got back over there, but that was cool too because it was like, all right, I'm fucking halfway through
[00:45:40] like, it's downhill now, you know, so that it kind of definitely fired me up to finish out, but then
[00:45:47] uh, towards the end and we were there for all four seasons. So we saw literally all four seasons.
[00:45:54] It was interesting. And um, by the end of it, by the end of it, uh, I remember when the ring
[00:46:04] route came to pick me up to go out, uh, I remember flying away from from the base that we were at
[00:46:12] and just thinking like, I felt kind of sad, like like almost like when you move away from
[00:46:17] somewhere and like I've moved my whole life, I moved around a lot. So I was like, damn, like this
[00:46:22] has been my home for the last year, you know, I'm kind of bummed to to to leave, but fuck this place.
[00:46:30] I can't wait to go home. Yeah, I got kind of lucky because I had been in the navy for a while
[00:46:35] when when I deployed to Iraq and especially my second deployment to Iraq, where I was in
[00:46:40] Ramaday and and like I, I, you know, sometimes people say, oh, I look back and I wish I would have
[00:46:48] appreciated it more. You know, people say that about certain parts of their life,
[00:46:53] I don't have that at all. Like I 100% appreciated every single day I was there. I was like, this is,
[00:46:58] this is the best part of my whole life is right. It's what's happening today right now.
[00:47:03] You know, so I got kind of lucky in the fact that, you know, even talking to the guys that were
[00:47:08] new guys on that deployment to a body, they, they just kind of, they were like, from then on,
[00:47:16] they be saying, damn, you know, I thought that's what every deployment was going to be like. It was,
[00:47:20] and it was, they just didn't have that same perspective of, hey, man, this is like this target
[00:47:27] rich environment where we're getting to do what everyone's dreamed of doing their whole life.
[00:47:32] And you're going to do it all the time. That doesn't happen, you know, it doesn't happen like that
[00:47:37] usually, you know, and it's hard. And so I was pretty lucky in the fact that I, I, I was,
[00:47:42] I could appreciate it. Yeah. I know, as far as the work went, like I was as far as like, like,
[00:47:48] being a seal and working there, like that, that was awesome, you know, and I was, you know,
[00:47:54] one of the biggest, like, I say concerns I had or not are even not concerned was just like a
[00:48:01] question to myself was, you know, what, what, how am I actually going to react and combat,
[00:48:09] you know, I mean, because everyone likes to think that they're ideally, you know, in a situation
[00:48:15] of shit popped off, you know, I'll be the, I'll be the guy who will, you know, hold my,
[00:48:20] have my shit together and and be that, you know, the rock or whatever, you know, I mean,
[00:48:25] and some people crumble, you know, and I saw that as a seal, like that, that was kind of my,
[00:48:34] I was always a realist, you know, was like, I've never been shot at. I've never been in a gunfight
[00:48:39] or whatever. So, I definitely, you know, I, I, I, I feel like I'm not a coward and I feel like I would
[00:48:46] step up and do, do what I got to do and perform. I feel like that, but I don't know it for sure,
[00:48:53] you know what I mean. And so that was, that was definitely when it happened and I, you know,
[00:49:00] and I did, I, I stepped up and, and felt very pleased with how that all went down and, and all the combat
[00:49:09] and everything that I had been involved with, like, that was definitely, um, rewarding to me, you know,
[00:49:16] like as a seal and, and as a man, just, and as a warrior, just like, okay, like, I felt legit, you know,
[00:49:23] I felt like fulfilled in that sense. So the work, the work was really good, but just as far as
[00:49:34] being in that environment, like, the IEDs was really like, the IEDs and the fucking like
[00:49:42] invisible enemy was kind of, um, discouraging, you know. It was like, I felt like we just had so much
[00:49:52] risk, you know, for not a whole lot of reward. And like, which is different, like I would say,
[00:49:59] or I feel like in like, Ramadi, it was like a different, just way different environment,
[00:50:05] um, but yeah. Yeah, no, that's, that's the, that's the way in surgeons are supposed to fight,
[00:50:13] right? You're not supposed to see them. They're just supposed to pick away at you the death of a
[00:50:17] thousand cuts, you know, indirect fire, IEDs and snipers, and they don't want you to ever see them,
[00:50:23] and, and that's what they want, and just to slowly pick away because they don't care about
[00:50:27] human life, they don't value human life, and here we are, you know, every time we lose someone,
[00:50:32] it's, it's a tragedy, and they don't care if they lose guys or not, they don't care. They don't care
[00:50:38] if civilians get killed, don't care about any of that. And so that's why they have, that's why
[00:50:42] they have an advantage in those situations, a psychological advantage is, hey, we, we don't care
[00:50:49] if you kill us, and by the way, we know you care about your people, and so we're going to pick
[00:50:53] away, and you're, hopefully you're never going to see us, and we don't care, we're going to blow
[00:50:57] you up, and we don't care. Yeah, that, I mean, that was pretty apparent, I mean, because a lot of the
[00:51:04] IEDs that went off were, you know, local villagers stepping on. Yeah, I'm triggered by civilians,
[00:51:10] and, and that, that just happened all the, all of the day I'm time, and, and we would, we would,
[00:51:19] you know, we would, we would aid the wounded and stuff like that, and they would like get pissed
[00:51:23] at us, and we're like, we didn't plant that shit, you know? Like, keep mad at them, not us.
[00:51:29] Yeah, that, that, that insurgency thing is, but yeah, and like, you know, it was, it was just super
[00:51:35] frustrating to me, like, it was super frustrating to me, dealing with like the politics involved
[00:51:47] with war, and, you know, I felt like we absolutely could have done things to give us more of
[00:51:57] an advantage, but it seemed like they were more concerned with politics and shit like that,
[00:52:04] you know, as more than more than like the safety of us, and I just felt like we could, you know,
[00:52:12] there's no reason why we should be going out in the daylight period, you know, we train, like,
[00:52:19] why not fight like we train, and, oh, because you guys got locked down from doing stuff at night, right?
[00:52:24] Oh, we got to do night shit, but we also did a lot of day shit, and, you know, to me, it was just,
[00:52:31] like, why the fuck are we doing this? Like, we have night vision, why are we going out there?
[00:52:35] Did you have Afghan forces with you? Sometimes. Mm-hmm. A lot of times we did. Well, uh, we,
[00:52:44] we had to work a lot in Ramadi in the daytime, um, and the main reason why we worked,
[00:52:49] well, there's a couple of big reasons why we're working the daytime in Ramadi,
[00:52:52] which as you, as you just pointed out, is a huge tactical disadvantage compared to being out at
[00:52:57] night where we can literally see in the enemy camps, I mean, it's, but in Ramadi, you know,
[00:53:02] we had to work with Iraqi soldiers who didn't have night vision. So, they didn't have flashlights.
[00:53:06] They would have like one flashlight for every four people, and we'd eventually got them flashlights
[00:53:10] and stuff, but anyways, it was, it was a problem because to go out at night with them,
[00:53:17] it was, they were blind. And so now, you're like, at a, you're at the same disadvantage,
[00:53:24] because you're trying to, you got people that can't see, mixed with people that can't see,
[00:53:27] and they're not getting anything out of it. They're not improving their skills at all.
[00:53:32] And they're just horrible.
[00:53:34] Yeah, and they were, they were not, not good, not good. And so that was one reason was to take
[00:53:39] them out in the daytime, to, to get them to operate, we had to go out with them in the daytime.
[00:53:43] And the other big one was the enemy knew that we owned the night. And so the enemy in Ramadi,
[00:53:48] they didn't come out at night, they came out in the daytime. So if you wanted to kill them,
[00:53:52] you had to go out when they were, when they were moving. And so that's when we're now, and, you know,
[00:53:56] we did both, and we did a ton of the night as well. And also, you know, we take advantage of the night
[00:54:01] to get in good positions, you know, when, and then during the daytime, they would come out to fight,
[00:54:07] and, you know, they'd get it. Yeah, we had, we had, we were working with the commandos, and they had
[00:54:14] night vision, but like I said, they were just terrible. And like, one of them almost shot me
[00:54:22] on an op, we were actually in a helicopter flying to Target. And it was one of their heavy gunners.
[00:54:32] And he, it was around midnight, and we were flying in a shenook to the target. And I was just kind
[00:54:43] of nodding off, just, you know, just trying to, you know, catch a little nap on the ride to the op,
[00:54:50] and it's pitch black, and the, and the hellow, obviously, and all of a sudden it's just,
[00:54:56] you know, like four or five rounds crack off. And the guy next, it was the guy next to me, and
[00:55:03] think God, he had his barrel down. And like, literally just shot like four or five rounds, like
[00:55:10] less than six inches from my feet. And there's just holes in the bottom of the, the bird, and
[00:55:16] shot the comms out of the hellow and everything. And at that point, I was just like, you know,
[00:55:23] I was, there's just kind of a used dish it, being shitty, and just reached over and took the rounds
[00:55:30] out of his gun and just, that was it. And just like, come over, it comes like, yeah, the fucking
[00:55:35] commandos, 80, you know, never, just like whatever. But so then we changed, like, all right,
[00:55:44] no more commandos rolling hot in the birds, you know, on the way to target target. And so we,
[00:55:50] we had changed that. So then the next one we did, we fucking got to, we got to our, our, our
[00:56:02] target bird landed, get out and do our formation. And also, and it's like a total brownout, you know,
[00:56:09] because the Afghanistan is super dusty and everything there. And the, the hellow lands where I'll
[00:56:15] get now in our formation and total brownout. And then all of a sudden, we hear fucking rounds going off.
[00:56:22] Because the, the dudes loading their pigs, like all of a sudden had to run away gun or whatever,
[00:56:29] where we don't know if we're getting contact it, like you can hear it's outgoing, but like why?
[00:56:34] Why is their outgoing fire when we're in filling? You know, are we getting contact or what's
[00:56:39] going on? And it's just these guys are fucking stupid with their weapons. And yeah, so that was always,
[00:56:46] always something fun. Always good. So you wrap up that deployment and come back to
[00:56:55] come back and roll into your next, next, but there. Yeah, come back and roll into the next
[00:57:01] button and I always wanted to. How was that? How was that coming home? Now you're, now you're home.
[00:57:06] You did the two weeks in the middle. How was the transition when you got home?
[00:57:11] It was, it was, it was rough. I was definitely dealing with some PTSD, I would say. And
[00:57:20] I was, I was definitely kind of angry. I was, I was angry. It was weird, weird emotions.
[00:57:34] Because I, I kind of was kind of pissed off at like, America, like, like, not America as a whole,
[00:57:43] but like, I felt like the politics, you know, like I said earlier, I felt like they really
[00:57:52] cared more about, or they just didn't really give a shit about our safety. I felt like, you know,
[00:57:59] it's one thing, like obviously we're doing a dangerous job. But why, why on earth are we not giving
[00:58:06] ourselves every advantage that we are capable of, you know, like the night vision and stuff like that?
[00:58:14] And a lot of times we would capture people who we knew were bad, you know, talking to our
[00:58:25] Intel guys and they're like 100% like this dude is a fucking terrorist. Like he's a bad dude. Like
[00:58:32] everyone in his phone, you know, they rip apart their shit and like every one of his contacts are bad,
[00:58:38] you know, like this guy's definitely an IED maker, you know, whatever. And so we've got these guys
[00:58:47] captured, but then we have to turn him into the Afghan government, which we also know is corrupt.
[00:58:53] And then all of a sudden these dudes are out on the streets again in a couple months time and
[00:59:02] making IEDs that, you know, me or my brothers could step on and fucking, that's a wrap. And,
[00:59:12] you know, Caleb Nelson was a seal that died on our deployment from our team. And
[00:59:19] it's just kind of, you know, life and death and war just puts things in a perspective. And
[00:59:30] it really made me angry that, you know, like Caleb couldn't come home because of an IED and like
[00:59:39] we're letting these people go. And I just felt like we weren't being
[00:59:45] utilized fully and like, like it was costing us. And so I was like really angry about that.
[00:59:56] And then also just kind of being in that environment for a long time, just
[01:00:03] different, you know, different mentality and then coming home to America and like people just
[01:00:10] don't understand how good it is here and it's like a fucking fairy tale, you know. And
[01:00:17] trying and listening to people talk and complaining about, about shit here. And I'm just like,
[01:00:25] you don't even have to, you don't even, you just walked down that sidewalk and didn't even give
[01:00:30] a fuck where you stepped. Like you're doing even care because you're not worried about anything.
[01:00:35] You're not worried if there's an IED there. Like you have running water. You took a shower today.
[01:00:41] You fucking, I had to burn my own shit, you know. So I was just like a lot of anger,
[01:00:50] you know, with that. And I was drinking a lot like, uh, and I also felt like I felt like
[01:00:57] seals where the only ones that kind of understood and got it. And then also being over there
[01:01:04] and I've gained a stand I saw, you know, can to heart, the main base and can to heart was like a
[01:01:12] fucking, it was like a little town, you know. And there's like, flag football leagues and shopping
[01:01:18] and TGI Fridays, people have birthday parties and shit like that. And you know, that's where,
[01:01:24] that's where like Tim McGrath lies in to do the concert for the troops and shit like that, you know.
[01:01:29] And it's like, uh, is this where we're staying, eating like kings, you know, and they're like, no,
[01:01:34] no, no, you're going out there. So then, you know, that's where I was and that's where, where me and my
[01:01:42] boys were, you know, living in the sock and doing some serious fucking shitty living, you know.
[01:01:51] And, and, and working a job that was dangerous as fuck every day. And then just seeing that kind of shit,
[01:02:00] like, I don't know, I just, I felt like before I had gone over overseas, I was like real,
[01:02:10] like, thank you for your service to everyone I saw, you know, and, and afterwards, I was just kind of the
[01:02:15] opposite. And, uh, it was like fuck all these motherfuckers in the end. So I was just disgruntled in whatever.
[01:02:24] And, uh, and, you know, I'd hear people talk about PTSD or this or that and I'm like,
[01:02:32] what the fuck are you? What are you afraid of? You know, you were on a main base that like,
[01:02:37] it wasn't, it's not even that thing, like you didn't experience war. But that was like just kind of
[01:02:45] immaturity at the time and, and like, like I said, me being just kind of disgruntled and, um,
[01:02:53] dealing with that and I was drinking like heavily, uh, and I was just a super aggressive person.
[01:03:03] And, um, it wasn't like a good, it wasn't good for my friends, a family, like people I cared
[01:03:10] about or whatever. And like I said, I felt like seals were kind of the only ones that understood.
[01:03:15] And then even amongst seals, I felt like only the ones who who had to live so shitty, like we did,
[01:03:23] like our platoon, you know, no running water for a year and like, like, just living in that environment
[01:03:31] was super rough. And I felt like they were the only ones who understood. But then again, it's like,
[01:03:36] I just spent a year with these assholes in a hundred by a hundred foot, you know,
[01:03:43] place, I don't want to see them. And so I just kind of felt alone a little bit, you know, and,
[01:03:52] whatever dealt with that, got, got through that, um, Doom Better Now. And I was
[01:04:00] like kind of disgruntled towards people claiming PTSD and all this kind of shit, uh, for years
[01:04:09] after that. And then actually some random, um, uh, this random chick at a dinner I was at,
[01:04:19] she was, uh, in the army or something like that. And, and she had, she was talking about PTSD.
[01:04:26] And I was just thinking like Jesus Christ, what the fuck are you? What is it, you know, and I kind of
[01:04:32] said my view points on it and she was like, well, you know, fear is relative. And, you know,
[01:04:40] like, you were, you were seriously trained and stuff for, for war and, and to be in that
[01:04:47] environment and, you know, some people weren't. And, like, fear is relative. Like this,
[01:04:53] like being in a gunfight to you, you know, and versus like just being in that country,
[01:04:59] like, could be the same amount of fear or more for that person. And I was just kind of like,
[01:05:05] you know, I never really thought about it that way. Okay, I'll change my mind.
[01:05:10] Yeah, well, war is different for everybody. And it's, I remember my first deployment to Iraq,
[01:05:16] we, we travel a lot and we went to a lot of different places. And so we go from like the incredible
[01:05:22] palaces that have been taken over that had subways and Starbucks. And then we, you know, the next
[01:05:27] day, we'd be out at some outstates and somewhere there'd be an ODA team just living in, you know,
[01:05:32] the most horrible living conditions. And then the next day you'd be with some random
[01:05:37] Marine Corps company out and some other forward-operative based and again, they're just living like
[01:05:41] in hell. And then you come back to another, another like main fob and it's all luxurious and nice.
[01:05:47] And I mean, it just, it kind of is what it is. First, you know, it just kind of is what it is. And that
[01:05:52] actually makes sense with that female set about, you know, hey, it's different people are there.
[01:05:58] They're there for different reasons. You know, like, we joined the seal teams because what we want
[01:06:06] to do is go out and go on patrol with a machine gun. That's like 100% of why you join the
[01:06:12] seal teams. So what I go here, you're hoping for this and five. You're praying for war. Yeah.
[01:06:17] And so I remember like being out there, man, I remember my very first up when I, we flew into
[01:06:26] this to this village and I remember being like super nervous, like holy shit. I'm fucking
[01:06:33] maybe see that I'm actually going on my first mission, like holy shit. And I'm just thinking,
[01:06:38] like, when we land, we landed at like 3 a.m. or something. And we, we offset like way far away.
[01:06:46] But I was thinking like, it's going to be guns blazing as soon as this helo lands. I jump out
[01:06:53] the helo and I'm just like full blown ready for war. Like, what are bringing on? Let's go.
[01:06:58] Where's been lobbing? And it was just pitch black quiet and sat there for fucking hours. And, you
[01:07:07] know, till the sun came up, nothing happened. I was like, God damn it. I saw disappointed, you know?
[01:07:12] Like, I was looking forward to like war. And then, you know, obviously we got, we got plenty.
[01:07:19] But yeah, I remember just being real antsy to, to get in a firefight and, you know, to do
[01:07:27] what I've been trained to do and put my training to the test, you know. And yeah, it's different
[01:07:32] for other people who are not experiences may vary. There's no doubt about that. So when you went to
[01:07:38] bat, when you got home and you got put into a new cartoon, did you guys keep a core group of guys
[01:07:43] from your from your previous cartoon together? Or was it like brand new? No, no, we had guys
[01:07:49] that stayed and, and some went, you know, to trade at some screen and standard turn of the
[01:07:55] day. Yeah, they standard shift. Few, a few core guys stayed together, four or five or whatever.
[01:07:59] And then you guys got a new chief, a new OIC, a new assistant to commander. Yeah, that was
[01:08:06] man, God, thank God. I am so, I so do not miss having fucking 20 bosses, you know, in the military.
[01:08:15] And then every, you know, at the drop of a hat, it can change. And then all of a sudden, it's like,
[01:08:21] nope, new flavor. We're, we're, now we're, you know, it's like, oh, Jaco's now our fucking
[01:08:27] commander. So we're all waking up at 430 and going to PT. It's like, what the fuck, when did this happen?
[01:08:32] This is bullshit. Oh, check. And as you get, you do another work up. Yep. And then, uh, I, uh,
[01:08:41] I'd always wanted to be a dog handler. Yeah, and I, I, I tried to volunteer to be a dog handler as a new guy
[01:08:48] and, and they said, no, you know, they want to, yeah, they want you to, to, here's your dog.
[01:08:54] That's name's 48. And, uh, make it bark. So, yeah, now I got to, um, to do the dog handling thing and,
[01:09:05] with super super excited about that. And, uh, it was, it was honestly such a great time.
[01:09:11] I had a badass dog and I was this first handler. And, uh, yeah, it was, it was super cool because,
[01:09:20] you know, well, one, I was, I was a one-poil-tune wonder. So I'd already kind of gotten that F-gainst
[01:09:29] and gotten some combat under my belt. And, um, you know, I was the classic worst, the worst guy in the
[01:09:36] teams is a one-poil-tune wonder. And, uh, so I was full blown. Just one cruise wonder. You knew everything.
[01:09:43] 100%. And, uh, and I got a fucking dog. So watch out. Stelling. My dog was super cool. And, um, they, like, uh,
[01:09:55] there, there were six of us that went over to work with the dogs and we all got along really well.
[01:10:01] And, uh, and that was super cool because now you're not a new guy, finally, you know, and, I mean, even on our
[01:10:09] deployment in Afghanistan, we were still fucking doing new guy shit. You're, you're a new guy.
[01:10:17] You're fucking new guy. I couldn't fucking believe it. I'm like, we literally, they made us
[01:10:24] shovel rocks one time. Like, like a whole, like, uh, dumpster or a dump truck full of rocks.
[01:10:31] And, they just, we just moved it from one pile and just tent over, like, 10, 15 feet to the right.
[01:10:38] And we just moved the pile of rocks to this make a new pile, 15 feet to the right. And it was,
[01:10:44] it was a disciplinary thing. It wasn't, you know, all the new guys. Your, your attitudes
[01:10:49] is not good. And we're just like, are you fucking serious? Like, we were just sort of firefighting with you.
[01:10:55] Like, you know, we're not like, we're expecting to like be boys now. They're like, shut up new guys.
[01:11:01] You're, you're attitude sucks. Go shovel rocks. And we're just like, God, and then, you know,
[01:11:07] we were like literally having to burn shit, you know, burn our own shit. Uh, we had, we had
[01:11:13] barrels that we had wrapped that, that cordon around and cut in half and, um, filled with diesel fuel.
[01:11:22] Those were, those were our, those were our shatters, but they needed burned. So when, uh, when the, when the
[01:11:27] new guys, you know, when, when we didn't, uh, have the best attitudes or, our attitudes weren't up to
[01:11:35] par, we, we shoveled rocks and burned shit. So I was definitely happy to not be a new guy anymore.
[01:11:42] Here. Um, but anyway, yeah. So I was a one-pointed one-year had a dog and, uh, got to go through
[01:11:50] another work up with the dog. So that was super cool and, and got to go through dog training school
[01:11:56] and, and learn about the dogs and, and, um, yeah, unfortunately, like right right before, it was,
[01:12:05] we were on like pre-depliment leave and they had told us like, hey, change plans. We're going,
[01:12:12] now we're going to U-com. So, uh, we don't need the dog anymore. Oh, and it was like, fuck man,
[01:12:19] this isn't like a piece of equipment. I mean, that's essentially how the Navy looks at them. They
[01:12:23] are, they are equipment, but, you know, obviously it's a dog and you, you, you form this like
[01:12:29] super strong bond and attachment with them, just like they're your pet. And, uh, my dog was super
[01:12:37] awesome and I'd worked with them so much. You know, it was like a robot. It was like a, uh, it was so cool.
[01:12:44] And, um, I was fucking so pissed off when they just dropped that on us and it's just like, yeah,
[01:12:50] like hand the leash over to someone else. And, yeah, so did that and, uh, then went to U-com and,
[01:12:59] and, you know, a lot of guys were fucking super pissed off that we were going to U-com and, you know,
[01:13:06] I was definitely looking forward to using my dog and, you know, doing that and Afghanistan,
[01:13:13] but, you know, that is what it is. You know, I definitely knew that there wasn't. I didn't see any
[01:13:21] value in just bitching about it. And, uh, it seemed like that was like the common thing was just,
[01:13:28] it seemed almost like if you weren't bitching about it, then you were looked at as a turd. And, like,
[01:13:34] if, you know, if you weren't bitching louder, then the guy next to you, then you're, you know,
[01:13:40] I'm, man, I'm so just point out we're not going to have to get in. Yeah, me too. I'm super disappointed.
[01:13:44] Like, yeah, well, I can't even sleep at night. Well, I don't even want to fucking go, you know,
[01:13:50] like, you know, it's just, yeah, I just realized just to shed some light on to everyone. So,
[01:13:55] when you deploy in a seal battoon or a seal troop, you can deploy different parts of the world.
[01:14:00] Sometimes you deploy to places like Iraq and Afghanistan, which is we just kind of discuss that's
[01:14:04] where everybody wants to go. Well, 95% well, you never know what the real number is. Because there's
[01:14:10] something we don't want to go. But there's, there's the attitude most guys want to go. And they
[01:14:15] want to go fight. But there's also, you have to deploy to other parts of the world where there's no
[01:14:19] work going on. You might just deploy to the Pacific or you might deploy. In this case, you
[01:14:23] come is for European commands. That's going over to Germany and doing, doing things out of
[01:14:29] Germany in different parts of Europe. And it's definitely not a high threat in five minutes. And so,
[01:14:36] yeah, and that's the way it goes sometimes. There's a mission that has to be done. And it's a different
[01:14:41] kind of mission. You're going to build relationships with other countries and you do these exercises
[01:14:46] and do training events. But it's not generally what guys are excited to do in the seal team. So
[01:14:53] there's always, there's always a, you know, I always get asked that question when I go and talk to
[01:14:57] seals is, hey, my guys are going here. How do I keep them on? How do I keep them engaged when
[01:15:05] yeah, no one wants to do it or they don't care about it. And it's like, yeah, you got to work through that.
[01:15:08] It's definitely, it's definitely a challenge because, you know, I would imagine, especially if you
[01:15:13] know, like that you're going to you come and then starting that work up. Because you still have to
[01:15:19] go through the work up and train as if, you know, your fucking life depends on it and that you're
[01:15:25] going to war and, you know, that you're the elite, you know, warrior and and you have to be ready for
[01:15:32] anything. So you like obviously our training is developed around that. But then having to keep
[01:15:40] up that motivation like it's, it's one thing when you're like fuckedy. This training sucks and
[01:15:46] it's um tired. It's hot. You know, like fucking covered in shit or whatever and I've got a hike
[01:15:53] 12 miles carrying this thing and it's like, well, we got to do it though because we're going to
[01:16:00] fucking war like this serious, you know. But then it's like, don't you come and why the fuck are we
[01:16:05] even training today? You know what I mean? But I don't know. So I didn't really have that attitude though.
[01:16:13] I was kind of excited to, you know, I had just gotten, we just done that, that year deployment
[01:16:18] to Afghanistan and it was, you know, my platoon was the one that was really, really shitty shitty
[01:16:25] living. The other two platoons were in nice bases that they were like had awesome gyms, like
[01:16:32] good food and stuff like that and, you know, so I wasn't, I wasn't too terribly upset about it.
[01:16:40] Obviously like everyone wants to go work and and kill bad guys like a champion. But, you know,
[01:16:47] when you, when you got to do it that it is what it is, you might as well fucking enjoy it.
[01:16:52] That's why I feel. Might as well make the most of it.
[01:16:55] At what point did you start GJitsu? I started, I started GJitsu actually in Buds.
[01:17:04] That was my introduction to Buds. One of our Buds instructors was, he, he was interested in
[01:17:12] GJitsu and liked it or whatever. And so as a punishment one day we had to do wet and sandy
[01:17:20] GJitsu, like introduction to GJitsu. And like a lot of guys were, we're not enjoying it because
[01:17:29] one, if you've never done GJitsu, you're 100% gonna get fucked up by anyone who has done it.
[01:17:34] And we were wet and sandy, so it was like just cold and wet and miserable and sand paper,
[01:17:40] like grinding on each other, you know. But I actually really enjoyed it. I was like holy shit,
[01:17:44] this is pretty cool. And one of the guys, there was two guys in our class that were both
[01:17:52] really high level wrestlers, like in high school. And they were probably like on a blue belt level,
[01:17:59] you know. They were probably like 135, 145 pounds. And at the time I was around 185, 190 pounds.
[01:18:07] I'd never done GJitsu ever or wrestled or anything like that. And I always punched, you know,
[01:18:14] I knew I punched hard, because I've been in a lot of fights, like street fights and shit,
[01:18:18] bar fights, but at that point, sorry, it wasn't bar fights, so it was like high school fights.
[01:18:26] Dodge ball fights. I did get in a dodge ball fight once, no bullshit. And so anyway, these,
[01:18:34] these little guys just tied me in a fucking knot. And I was just so impressed. Like,
[01:18:41] because looking at these dudes, I would be like 100% I'll fuck this guy up in a fight. And
[01:18:47] we, you know, they were like, all right, no striking, no, no punching, but we're going to grapple.
[01:18:52] I don't like, okay. And we're grappling, and they're just completely fucking me up. And I was like,
[01:18:57] thinking, oh my god, if these little 80-bitty men can tie me in a knot like this and just make me
[01:19:05] helpless, like imagine what I could do if I learned this. So I started rolling with one of my friends
[01:19:13] who was like 6 to 240 pounds at the time and just super aggressive. And he was probably around a
[01:19:24] blue belt level of knowledge, maybe not quite a blue belt. You know, but he knew definitely more than I did.
[01:19:32] And he was really aggressive too and he was like all about rolling. So we would roll nogy
[01:19:41] and he would just constantly. This was where, this was in Buds or in Buds and then SQT,
[01:19:49] Buds was the introduction to it. And I was like, whoa, I fucking love this is cool. And then I
[01:19:53] started talking to one of my classmates who is also into it and you know, he had done, he had done some
[01:19:59] training before the Navy and like I said, he was around a blue belt level. So when you got to Team
[01:20:04] 10, did you start training or media that one of the academies? No, I didn't start training at one of the
[01:20:09] academies until after Afghanistan, I came back and because one of the guys, one of my like my
[01:20:15] see that he was, he was a purple belt at the time and we would roll on occasion, you know,
[01:20:25] and he would be like, and he would tell me like, man, you have like great, you know, aggression and
[01:20:32] ability and all this shit, but you got to go to an academy and learn, you know, and I had only learned
[01:20:38] just from that guy that dude beat my ass over and over and he would literally like just just
[01:20:44] fucking get on top pressure, grind, arm triangle, you know, and he'd be like, all right, man,
[01:20:51] you know, I got on top, you know, I fucking arm triangle, I squeezed like that. Don't let me do that again.
[01:20:57] Like, all right, got it. Yeah, try harder. Try harder, you know, you, you got to do something.
[01:21:03] No, you're not doing anything, you know what I mean? So it was one of those. So I had gotten pretty good
[01:21:09] at just getting my ass kicked and dealing with a big large human or whatever. So then when I actually showed
[01:21:17] up to an academy, I'd been doing that for a couple years, you know, with him and never put on a
[01:21:24] gear or anything like that, but then afterwards, yeah, he was like, you got to join Jim. So I joined
[01:21:29] a Jim, put on the gear and then really like, that's when my jiu-jitsu, I would say, really
[01:21:35] started my journey and that was in 2012. And did you have someone to train with on your U-com
[01:21:41] deployment? Um, yeah, trained with my CDADD, he was there and I trained and U-com, like we were
[01:21:51] obviously going to different countries. So I would go and hit up different gyms and the different
[01:21:56] countries and then all the other, the other countries, seal teams, you know, that we worked with.
[01:22:02] There's always someone who's in the combatives, you know, so I would basically just find out who
[01:22:07] that guy was. Yeah, who wants to get some and then we'd roll the mats out and fucking train and
[01:22:13] and I was trying to get guys in the jiu-jitsu back then and I was telling, you know, it's a great
[01:22:18] workout and people are just looking at me like, that's not a fucking workout and you know,
[01:22:24] you're not lifting weights, you're not running, you know, I'm like dude, it is a workout for sure.
[01:22:29] And it's, you know, one that the reason I liked jiu-jitsu specifically was because it was like a
[01:22:37] deadly martial art, you know, I could fucking choke you and like you're tapping, you're asking me,
[01:22:44] like please don't kill me, you know, and that's what I thought was fucking cool about it.
[01:22:51] And uh, that is definitely one of the cool things about it. You know, like there's there's times
[01:22:56] where I don't know, yeah, like we're we're gunfighters, I get it, but your first line is should be you,
[01:23:05] like my, my body. What can I do with my fucking vessel that I was brought into this universe with,
[01:23:13] like versus you? If I don't have a weapon, if I don't, you know, it's just me and you.
[01:23:18] Yeah, one of one, like let's go. Yeah, I mean, I got to see you like over and over again,
[01:23:23] just guys that didn't know how to didn't know anything and they'd get in a simple prisoner
[01:23:28] handling situation and wouldn't be able to handle someone. And the only thing that they would
[01:23:33] know to do is like bludgeon them in the head, which is cool. That's fine. I get it. But when you
[01:23:39] bring that person into the detainment facility and they're freaking all jacked up and then it turns
[01:23:45] out that they're not the person you were looking for or whatever. And, and that just doesn't,
[01:23:50] that's just not, that's just not cool. And it's not, it's not, it's not tactically the best thing to do
[01:23:57] because you don't have the control. I mean, you can't count on punching someone or hit them in the
[01:24:02] head. You can't count on that solving the problem. Whereas, jiu-jitsu, it's like, yeah, no, I have this
[01:24:07] human under control. Whereas, you know, you've punched people before that you've nailed them
[01:24:14] and they shook it off like it didn't even happen. You know, the whole thing with like,
[01:24:18] muscle strikes. I've seen, I've had guys, I mean, I've muscle strike plenty of people, but I've
[01:24:26] had guys that I've seen put the craziest, most aggressive muscle strike on a dude and have the
[01:24:33] dude's bleeding. Yeah, but like still fighting. Yeah, I do think that one's a fucking hell thing. And so,
[01:24:40] so yeah, from the, especially when people are in fear for their life. Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:24:44] And they hate you and they hate your society and they're a geodist. It's like, yeah, that,
[01:24:51] muscle strike, if it doesn't knock them out, which sure it is possible. But the idea that that was
[01:24:56] just going to stop someone in their tracks 100% of the time was completely ludicrous.
[01:25:01] Now, with jiu-jitsu at least you're going to have some control, more control. And even that's
[01:25:06] not 100% you know, because you could, you know, you've got someone that's really small,
[01:25:10] it's someone that's really big and depending on your skill level, there could be issues there.
[01:25:13] But yeah, so you finally started training at a school. Yeah.
[01:25:17] 2012. Yeah. And they just dove in all the way. Yeah, I started, I started training at a school in
[01:25:24] 2012 and started competing in jiu-jitsu. You know, I really, once I once I joined a school,
[01:25:33] I learned more in six months than I did in four years of course, no-gui rolling with my buddies.
[01:25:39] You know, and I mean that it was just the blindly, the blind essentially, like who knows the most today.
[01:25:45] And that's like you guys are all fucking wrong. We're all teaching each other wrong shit, you know,
[01:25:49] and I mean, so I learned more in six months than I did that whole time. And so at that point,
[01:25:55] I'd really like fallen in love with jiu-jitsu. And I started competing all the time and was doing
[01:26:03] really well because I was competing as a white belt, you know, but I had already had a
[01:26:09] shit load of grappling experience, you know, with fucking big strong dudes who are just
[01:26:13] fucking me up. But now, like, now I'm the big strong guy and I know a little bit and I've been in
[01:26:21] like hard situations on the map, you know what I mean? And then obviously just the team guy just
[01:26:29] will to fight, you know, that's always a different level. You can tell when you roll with a team
[01:26:35] guy, even when a team guy is brand new at jiu-jitsu, they're still going to be, you can just tell
[01:26:42] that they're different because their will to fight is generally higher. Yeah. So anyway, I start
[01:26:48] competing a lot and doing really well and then start fighting and doing really well in that as well.
[01:26:55] And then, you know, that led me to what I'm doing now. And then you actually took over when you came
[01:27:00] home from your U.K. to play me to go over the combatants program? Yeah. Yeah. I took over the combatants
[01:27:06] program that was something that, you know, I felt like kind of lacked in the seal teams. You know,
[01:27:16] I was very shocked at that. I was surprised at that. You know, obviously where
[01:27:22] the seals are the best in the world, you know, at what we do. And, you know, we're gunfighters
[01:27:30] and all that shit. But I would imagine that our hand-to-hand combat, you know, like everyone thinks,
[01:27:38] like, oh, if I can see, he must, you know, tap me on the shoulder and I'll die, you know. And it's true.
[01:27:45] Just forever when he's listening. It's definitely true. But I hadn't gone to that school yet.
[01:27:50] So I was like confused as to why that wasn't a school or whatever. So anyway, I felt like with at this
[01:27:59] point, I was, I was competing quite a bit and having, having some pretty good success in the
[01:28:07] fight MMA, Gigi-Jitsu world. And I'd also had, you know, real world experience, you know, a lot of
[01:28:14] real world experience dealing with prisoner handling and stuff like that. And I just felt like,
[01:28:22] I felt like I could bring, I felt like I could do a good job at leading the combatives. So
[01:28:33] I took that on board and they gave me a shot and I rewrote the curriculum for combatives that we
[01:28:41] used on the East Coast and it was, it was really good, you know, and I went into with the
[01:28:48] operationally focused mindset, you know, not, if, if you're doing it, I'm all about Gigi-Jitsu. I love
[01:28:55] Gigi-Jitsu. However, if you're doing a triangle choke on target, something's probably
[01:29:00] going terribly wrong. But it's definitely not a bad thing to know Gigi-Jitsu, you know, to
[01:29:08] mean especially as an operator, you're dealing with human beings and you're not just, you know,
[01:29:13] you're not just going to go in and fucking kill everyone on target, you know, there could that happen,
[01:29:19] yeah, absolutely. But is that going to have them probably not? And you're going to have to deal with
[01:29:24] human beings and, you know, anything from just marshaling them to a full-on fight for your life
[01:29:32] is combatives related, you know, so I covered all of that in my program and I really focused on
[01:29:44] basic, simple things that you could remember during a time of stress, you know, like,
[01:29:52] you're not going to remember 12 steps to an arm bar, something like that when you're in a situation
[01:29:58] and you need it, you know what I mean, especially in a combative situation overseas, like that's,
[01:30:04] your adrenaline's going to be going like crazy, it's going to be fast, you need something simple
[01:30:09] effective and that, you know, that you can remember easily. And it's also, you know, how it is like
[01:30:16] in a, in a work-up, you're, you're, you're getting fed through a fire hose essentially,
[01:30:21] it's so much shit, you're, you're learning and you're expected to be
[01:30:24] proficient and like, perfect at all, all of it before you go out the door. So our combatives, we didn't
[01:30:31] get a whole lot of time, you know, it was like a two-week thing and so I, I really focused on
[01:30:38] developing techniques and things that, you know, and would also be effective,
[01:30:46] effective towards your enemy or your, your person that you're dealing with, but also mitigate
[01:30:56] risk to the operator, you know, like, muzzle strikes are great because you can muzzle strike a
[01:31:02] hundred people in a row in your hands feel fine, you know, you're not worried about breaking
[01:31:06] your weapons in control. Yeah, so, you know, that was kind of my focus was operationally
[01:31:12] focused mindset and, you know, and on the west coast, I felt like, yeah, from what I had seen,
[01:31:20] going out there and working with those guys, it was a lot of, uh, I felt like more guys were
[01:31:26] interested in combatives, but there was more of like a sporty kind of thing, like they're up in the
[01:31:31] fight room, doing jujitsu and stuff like that and which, which I thought was great, like I said,
[01:31:37] it's better, it's definitely better to, to, you know, have it not needed, then need it not have it.
[01:31:44] And so I think that it was good that guys were doing that, but I didn't think that it was
[01:31:49] operationally focused enough, you know, like, I don't think that you should be training combatives
[01:31:53] and PT gear, you know, like I had my, like the program that I set up was all scenario driven
[01:32:00] and it was all like trained like you fight, you know, so in your, in your camis and your boots with
[01:32:07] your gear, you know, because handling someone and PT gear versus handling someone and, you know,
[01:32:14] a full kit is totally different as well. Yeah, yeah, well, there's, it's, you know, I was,
[01:32:22] the discussion that used to happen a lot with all this stuff, because believe me, I was in this
[01:32:28] discussion for a long, long time. If you, you reach, or you get a ton of fucking pushback.
[01:32:36] People are super, people are simple, emotional about, about combatives and, you know,
[01:32:43] I would always, like, I wasn't, I wasn't as emotional as I wasn't very emotional about it,
[01:32:50] but for me, it was just like, hey, guys need to know how to do this. This is, this isn't about
[01:32:54] emotion. This is about just the facts of being ready to be prepared, being prepared on the battlefield.
[01:33:00] That's what you need to be. And, you know, one of the things that people would say was, you know,
[01:33:07] the, like the speed shooting contest, you shouldn't do that because it'll take away from your
[01:33:13] operational capability. Okay, I get it. However, who does better on the range? The guy that's like a,
[01:33:19] a hobby shooter, too, and then goes out to whatever CQC, he's drilling nails all day long.
[01:33:26] The same thing with a parachuteing, like, okay, so I skydive whatever. I'm a skydiver on the
[01:33:32] weekends, and I like to go down and have a ton of jumps. I have, you know, 2000 jumps with my slick rig.
[01:33:37] How do I do when I put a combat equipment on? I do awesome. I'm way better than, like, a guy
[01:33:41] like me, because I wasn't like a recreational skydiver. When I ever put equipment on, it was like,
[01:33:46] it was a, it was a, I had to pay attention. Whereas the guys that were good skydivers in the civilian side,
[01:33:52] they were good. Same thing with like, oh, who's going to do better in a grappling match, a guy that
[01:33:59] wrestled in high school with his gear on or a guy that, you know, has his gear on, it's like it doesn't matter.
[01:34:05] You get certain skill level, and you're going to do great. And that's just the way it is. Now,
[01:34:11] what you can't do is just say, oh, well, we're never going to train with gear on, because there
[01:34:16] are certain, you know, it's like saying, hey, I'm never going to train with the gear. If you,
[01:34:21] if someone never train with the gear before, and they go against someone with the gear,
[01:34:25] it depends on how long that person's been training with the gear for, because hey, no gear
[01:34:29] and gear have all kinds of similarities. They have all kinds of similarities. They also have some
[01:34:34] differences, and depending on how much you do of each is where you're going to kind of shake out,
[01:34:40] which one you're better at. But there are so much crossover between gear and no gear between
[01:34:47] skydiving on the weekends and skydiving in the teams and shooting on the weekends and shooting in
[01:34:53] the teams. The way I was looked at it was train more train all the time with everything, you know,
[01:34:59] as much as you can. And that's, that's how you get better at things. But yeah, that combat of
[01:35:04] thing was, it still was, it still is. I know. It's hard. It's hard to change. It's a shift. It's a taboo thing
[01:35:14] for some reason, and it totally depends on who's at the head of the table. You know, what, what
[01:35:22] their flavor is, what their take is on it. And if the guy, you know, is like you or me, and then it's like,
[01:35:28] hey, we're all going to fucking, we all need to know this. We all need to, and then other guys come in,
[01:35:32] they're like, oh, that shit's stupid. We don't need that. Yeah. And I was, I was when someone would say,
[01:35:37] guys should be working on shooting. I'd say, you know, I totally agree. Absolutely. You know,
[01:35:42] give us a range, you know, in the building. And we'll do that in the building, because that's
[01:35:46] without question or primary weapon system. And, you know, no doubt, you want to be a great shot,
[01:35:53] for sure. Guess what? How many hours are you going to shoot today? I mean, are you going to shoot
[01:35:59] 22 hours a day? Because you're going to have some time at some point where you go, you know what,
[01:36:02] let's get some other skills in here. You know, we might as well know, and like you said earlier,
[01:36:07] you can't just go, you don't just go on target and shoot everyone. There's a, there's a,
[01:36:13] female, you know, Dave Burke, who's one of the guys at echelon front. Good deal. Yeah, he has a,
[01:36:19] he has a story that he tells about the first time he came face to face with the, like,
[01:36:23] Iraqi woman that did not want him in the house. And he's, you know, whatever, a 18-year
[01:36:28] marine at this point, and he didn't know what to do. Yeah. And it's like, yeah, you, you, you need to
[01:36:36] train. You need to train to handle those situations. And, and a lot of people, you know, that people
[01:36:41] are unpredictable. They're just totally unpredictable. And especially in a situation where they don't
[01:36:49] know, like, a bunch of people with guns and body armor just busted up in their fucking house. Like,
[01:36:55] you think that person's going to be like, just cool as a cucumber or a calm, like, I don't know.
[01:37:02] And then when you put hands on people to, people freak the fuck out. And, and you know, and you don't
[01:37:08] need to just muzzle strike everyone. Like you said, like, if you do that, you're going to get
[01:37:14] shut down real quick. You know what I mean? And you should be as an elite warrior, you should be
[01:37:20] expected, or at least I expect people to handle themselves. Like, and you shouldn't let this
[01:37:27] fucking Iraqi woman just walk all over you or fucking flail around because like, you don't know what to
[01:37:33] do. I can't muzzle strike or I can't shoot her. So what do I got to do? You know what I mean?
[01:37:38] And if you've never, and that's just like a woman. But if let, now you have like a fighting age
[01:37:44] male or something. And you know, if he resists, I'll just kill no. That's not the case always. You know,
[01:37:50] it's definitely not like, and you know, you definitely don't want the first time that you're
[01:37:59] handling a human being like that to be overseas when it's real. And they can, you know, very easily
[01:38:05] get to your shit on your kit. And you know, it can be a bad day. And especially like, I tell people,
[01:38:11] you know, just think of like muzzle, muzzle discipline and awareness, you know, like when you have
[01:38:17] your gun, even at high ready and then you're marshalling someone and they freak the fuck out. Now
[01:38:21] all of a sudden you've got a hot weapon, like going around the room, it's just shit that there's so
[01:38:26] much things that you, you need to think about. And the more you do, the more comfortable you're
[01:38:32] going to be with it. And that was kind of my mindset towards it. At what point did you realize you were
[01:38:38] going to get out? Well, I wasn't sure I was fighting and stuff. And I was just kind of doing that
[01:38:50] as as for fun as a hobby on the weekends and competing and stuff like that. And then I had gone out
[01:38:59] and trained at blackhouse with some UFC fighters. And I had always like looked at the UFC,
[01:39:09] you know, I was always a fan. And I enjoyed fighting and stuff. And but I'd always looked at those
[01:39:17] guys like they were kind of superhuman or like, like it was like the NFL of fighting, like those
[01:39:23] guys are genetic freaks or whatever. You know what I mean? When you think of someone in the NFL,
[01:39:27] you're just like, man, it must be nice to be born like that, you know, or whatever. But fighting
[01:39:33] is kind of a unique thing where, I don't know, anyone can do it. And as long as you just put in the
[01:39:41] the work, you know what I mean? So, and being a genetic freak helps too. But, but I got in there,
[01:39:49] I got in the blackhouse and I trained with some of the people in the UFC and I was just like,
[01:39:53] holy shit, like, I'm actually like doing fine. Like I'm hanging with these guys. And, and
[01:40:00] I'm, you know, talking to them and just kind of getting to know some of these guys and just made
[01:40:05] it a little more human. You know what I'm like? What did you do before your fighter? Like,
[01:40:10] oh, I fucking worked on a restaurant, you know, as a bus boy or whatever. I was, you know, this,
[01:40:15] that third. And I was just thinking, you know, and they're all looking at me like, dude, you're
[01:40:20] fucking navy seal. Like, and I'm just like, yeah, but that's all I've ever, no, and that's all I've
[01:40:25] ever done. I did right out of high school, you know. And, and I'm just me, you know, and I know,
[01:40:32] like, I'm not special, you know what I mean? And it just kind of made it, it had a like a shift or
[01:40:40] like a realization, like, these are just people just like you and, and they just fucking stuck with
[01:40:47] fighting and practiced it until they were good enough to beat, you know, the competition and now they're
[01:40:53] here. And I was like, fuck, I, I could do that. Like, I'm pretty good, you know, and yeah, and I've
[01:40:59] been through some shit, like, I could push myself hard. Like, fuck, I could do this. And at the time,
[01:41:06] like, I was already been a seal for a while and, and, you know, I got to experience a ton
[01:41:14] and life and just, in war and, and just that whole lifestyle and that whole thing and, and, uh,
[01:41:26] I was just out of crossroads, you know, and I was like, well, I can stay in and make a career out of
[01:41:33] this, like I was planning on doing, I was planning on staying in for 20 years, um, and, you know,
[01:41:39] I can screen and, you know, try and make it over there and, or I can get out and kind of pursue this
[01:41:46] and, and at the time I was 29 or, yeah, I was 27 when I was like, making this decision.
[01:41:54] And, um, I was like, you know, fighting this kind of a young man's game and, uh, like you read earlier
[01:42:02] in the beginning of this, like, you can't, you can't even pause time, you know, wait for no one.
[01:42:07] And, uh, I was like, well, if I, if I just keep down this road, I, I don't want to think like,
[01:42:17] what if or like regret, you know, and I was like, I've already been on this path for a while and,
[01:42:24] and it's cool and all that, but I want to see what else I can do. So, and I was really
[01:42:31] fucking struggling with, with that decision for a long time, it was stressing me out and,
[01:42:35] uh, then once I just said, fuck it and this decided, you know, which way I was going,
[01:42:42] then the, like, all that stress, like, relief, this, it was a big reliever.
[01:42:47] And, uh, yeah, decided to get out and, there's what you, what you read that?
[01:42:52] Um, I got out in 2018.
[01:42:57] And, how many amateur fights did you have when you were in?
[01:43:00] Uh, like, 17 or something?
[01:43:03] And then, and did you go pro while you were still in?
[01:43:05] No, they wouldn't let me. And that was like, it was so frustrating to me because in Virginia,
[01:43:11] the amateur rule set is the exact same as pro. So, it's day before weigh-ins, um, you know,
[01:43:18] all strikes, like, those, those, no shimpads, you know, it's four ounce gloves, no head gear,
[01:43:24] you know, it's, it's, uh, it's fucking pro. Or five minute rounds? Uh, no, there were three,
[01:43:32] three, three minute rounds. Three minute rounds, yeah. Three minute rounds.
[01:43:36] Um, but some, some of them had five minute rounds, like I thought North Carolina.
[01:43:41] So, yeah, it was no different, you know, and, uh, trying to explain that to like my command and shit,
[01:43:48] and I'm like, there is literally no difference. And a guess what, like, a punch from punch in the
[01:43:54] face from an amateur feels the same from a pro. That's what I'll tell you about. Like,
[01:43:59] those, that bruise that came from an amateur, it would've came from a pro too.
[01:44:03] When I talked to Tim Kennedy about this, like, it's so crazy that Army gave that guy and gives him
[01:44:09] so much, he's a great guy and obviously a credible fighter. But yeah, I mean, he was just full
[01:44:14] on just getting after it, right? Well, and he still is. Yeah, and they support him. Yeah, he's all,
[01:44:19] it's awesome. They take some date. Man, I ran into total fucking roadblocks left and right with my
[01:44:26] fighting. And, um, you know, and I used to argument all the time, like, guys, you don't understand the
[01:44:33] same way, Brian stay up. Yeah, he was in the Marine Corps. Yeah, I talked to Brian Boffs or the Marine
[01:44:38] Corps just out there fighting in the WEC. But the, uh, no training, Tim Kennedy, they, they sponsored him.
[01:44:44] Yeah. Yeah. And there was like Ranger up or whatever. Yeah. Well, Ranger's up is actually Tim's company.
[01:44:51] No Tim, but for a while, Tim, Tim was like, he, I forget the exact story, but he, he was sponsored
[01:44:58] by, like, the Army. Yeah, for a while. They were using it as like a recruiting tool. And then he said,
[01:45:03] listen, you can either keep paying me a sponsorship or you can just let me come back on active duty.
[01:45:07] And, and they were like, uh, that sounds like a good financial deal for us. So yeah, Tim, Tim's,
[01:45:12] yeah, and that's, and that's why I kind of was forced to choose because I was running into so much
[01:45:19] fucking bullshit. Yeah. And, um, you know, like glory, uh, glory had come to town. And they were doing
[01:45:28] a fight at the Hampton Coliseum. And, um, you know, at this point, I had already had quite a few fights
[01:45:35] under my belt and had some popularity, I guess, as a fighter and, and they had heard about me. And,
[01:45:44] they invited me to fight on the show. And Mike Tyson was going to be there in shit. And I was like,
[01:45:49] man, this is going to be a fucking huge opportunity. It's on Spike TV too. And, um, I was, you know,
[01:45:56] I was like, can I, can I fight on this? And, and they're like, yeah, you know, we'll, we'll see what
[01:46:02] we can do. Love a blonde. And then last, you know, last minute they, they told me, no, you know,
[01:46:09] and I was just like, if I would've been your boss, you would've been fighting. And that's, that's
[01:46:14] a shitty part is like, you know, it depends on who's, who's at the table at the moment.
[01:46:20] And you know, now that I think about it, because I'm just sitting here thinking like,
[01:46:23] there's probably a, in fact, I remember seeing some kind of policy that they put in place at
[01:46:29] some point. I forget even to say if it was yes or no, I forget. But I remember. But my argument to
[01:46:34] it was like, all the time was like, like, just same one with the skydiving, you know, like,
[01:46:38] guys fucking skydive all the time, there's leap frogs, you know, why not, why don't the navy,
[01:46:43] why doesn't the navy use me as a recruiting tool, you know, like, I, I would, I don't want to get
[01:46:49] out of the teams. I want to stay in the teams, but I also want to fight and like, I can do this.
[01:46:54] Like, I was ranked number one on the East Coast and two weight classes, you know, and I was like,
[01:47:00] I'm pretty good at this shit, like, you know, and I don't understand why we don't utilize this,
[01:47:08] you utilize me as a recruiting tool, you know, go to the fight, set up a fucking pull-up bar, hand out
[01:47:13] t-shirts and try and hand, you know, or go to the, they had me go to the national,
[01:47:17] uh, high school wrestling contest or tournament, and they had me do like a combatives demonstration
[01:47:26] and and had me go out there and wrestle with all the, the high school students and stuff.
[01:47:30] Yeah, yeah, I fucking brought it. Yeah, I'll tell you what, we had an assumption for all of you.
[01:47:36] Yeah, you know, I was up at the California State Championships last year, or no, it was 2019, yeah.
[01:47:43] It was like, a bunch of high-endism. Well, yeah, I mean, my, my, my daughter was competing, and, but,
[01:47:49] you know, we're up there at the boys, they're just animals, they're animals. It's, it's awesome to see.
[01:47:55] Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, those, those kids were fucking taught. Oh, yeah,
[01:47:59] they put in and they fucking, they all wanted some. Oh, sure, yeah. They were like, and, and, because I was there
[01:48:04] in like, Cammy, Cammy pants, you know, in the fucking blue UDT seal shirts and, and we brought the
[01:48:11] bullet bar and, and, you know, because the, I think, but buds like, they try to get wrestlers.
[01:48:17] Sure, they do. Because wrestlers, you know, wrestlers, I don't want you to want to say,
[01:48:22] wrestlers have a good chance of making it through buds because that's not true. It's definitely
[01:48:26] not true. It was slightly better chance than a normal. Right. However, not right. However, wrestlers
[01:48:31] are used to a fucking grind. And that's probably why they're a little bit more comfortable and
[01:48:38] used to the grind factor of buds that does not mean they're used to getting cold and wet and
[01:48:44] dealing with all that shit, but they're used to dealing with the grind. So, whatever. And they're
[01:48:49] competitive. So, uh, so we went there and yeah, all those, all these fucking high school wrestlers
[01:48:55] are looking at me like, I got something to prove, you know, or whatever. And, and I'm out there
[01:49:01] representing the fucking seal team. So, like, I got something to prove to you, let's go, young buck.
[01:49:05] And, uh, so we, we, no, it was a good time. But I was like, why don't they fucking, they're
[01:49:12] cool with this, but not like fighting, like, what's the difference? Like, I don't know. So,
[01:49:18] I just ran into tons of frustrating headaches like that. And that's what ultimately
[01:49:24] decided to, you know, I was just decided to go this way. And I'm glad I did, but
[01:49:29] yeah, and that's, you know, I got to say like the seal teams, I never tried to fight pro, but
[01:49:35] like the seal teams was totally support, like I would go and train at places that give me.
[01:49:39] Well, the West Coast was, yeah, a lot different. Yes. You guys, you guys are definitely more
[01:49:45] supported on that kind of stuff. Extra curricular. Sure. Thanks. So, you get out and then when did
[01:49:52] you go pro? Uh, right after I got out. So, you've been pro for a year, or a half, two years, right?
[01:49:58] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How many fight pro fights do you have? I've only done two pro fights so far.
[01:50:03] I won my first one by TKO in the third round. It was a good, really good fight against another
[01:50:13] pro who he was a pro boxer as well, and he had called me out and kind of campaigned for the fight
[01:50:18] or whatever, and so I bled. And then, and then I did my LFA debut.
[01:50:27] Um, I fight in that sungun. I don't know if you've seen any pictures of videos. I have unfortunately seen that.
[01:50:34] Yeah, you can't unsee it. You're welcome. So, that's actually my buddy, Jeff Gumm. He owns that company.
[01:50:42] Yeah, no Jeff. Yeah, so, um, so obviously, like, I tried to support other team guys and their ventures
[01:50:49] and stuff like that, and, you know, um, that was right up my alley with the, uh, I thought it was funny.
[01:50:56] If I'll pretty much do anything if I think it's funny. And, uh, so I, I fought in the sungo, which is
[01:51:02] for those of you don't know, it, it's kind of looks like a American flag diaper sort of thing.
[01:51:08] But it's sex. Yeah, well, it's from Brazil. In Brazil, there's a sungun, there's a sungow.
[01:51:15] And I think this sungow is like the smaller one and the sungow is like a little bit, but they're
[01:51:19] their speedos. Yeah, they're such a speedos. Yeah, they're speedos. There's speedos and Dean Lister
[01:51:26] because he has so much Brazilian influence in his brain, he went through his face of training
[01:51:34] with a sungow. And, and, uh, those are some of the worst years in my life. Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:51:40] But, no, no, or self, we can't do that today. Yeah, so, uh, I'm not, I'm very anti-sunga and sungow.
[01:51:49] But, but you, you know, you go for it. Well, I'd ask you, it's if, if I wouldn't, I would make me want
[01:51:55] to fight you less if you were wearing that. So you got that little cycle out there. Right?
[01:51:58] Do it, or it was like confusing to them. Yeah. Yeah, which is, I mean, do you know what,
[01:52:04] were you watching like UFC when everyone was when all the Brazilians were still wearing them and you
[01:52:08] have to see, and they still do sometimes. Yeah, yeah, I've seen some of them. Yeah, but anyways.
[01:52:12] But I thought it was funny. So, uh, so I got a little patch sewn into it so I got put my cup in it
[01:52:18] and that was my, my new fighting attire. And, uh, yeah, I went out. It, it could never,
[01:52:27] I don't know, it was awesome. We'll say that. Uh, I went out. I, I, I fought on LFA, on National TV.
[01:52:34] And, um, I, it was during a military appreciation fight. And so they hosted the fight
[01:52:42] in at an army base and it was in a hanger, you know, with helicopters and we got all these people,
[01:52:48] all these active duty army people and their uniforms and stuff in the crowd. And, uh,
[01:52:54] you know, here I am the, the Navy seal and the American flag speedo and, and come out to fight,
[01:52:59] um, and got knocked out 30 seconds. So it's like, good. I can't get really that much worse from here.
[01:53:08] So that's cool. Day. But now it was, it was actually, they called it the craziest 31 seconds in LFA history.
[01:53:15] Yeah, I watched it. I watched it. It was, it was, it was, it was. It was, it was. It was, it was. It
[01:53:18] would have a lot of time to watch fights. Yeah. I had time for life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:22] But yeah, it's, uh, I, I saw it. I, I, I think you posted it somewhere or, I posted it. I posted the
[01:53:28] video. I mean, which some, which so many people were, were so kind, like they were like,
[01:53:33] wow, I can't believe you posted this and like sat him down first, right? Then you sit him down?
[01:53:38] No. So he had a 14 inch reach on me. He was 6, 6, 3 and, um, fucking big astute. And
[01:53:45] honestly, like, I didn't even know, like we were, we were, we were recordgile with each other,
[01:53:50] like at Wands and stuff like that. So I wasn't sure if like we were going to touch gloves or not,
[01:53:54] you know, because it's always kind of a, I feel like they should just like make that a rule like you are.
[01:53:58] You, you either do or you're done. It's a rule with me now. But I, uh, I wasn't sure if we were
[01:54:04] going to touch gloves or not and like kind of coming out due to he honestly, he hit me like,
[01:54:10] I didn't even know he could reach me from where he was. And it was just like, I think from that,
[01:54:15] that, that big weight, I do a big weight cut and, uh, I think it just, you know, just fucking,
[01:54:22] just put me on queer street right away. And, uh, so right out of the gates, I was rocked and,
[01:54:29] and was kind of fell down and was just, he'd swarm me and I was just getting punches thrown at me,
[01:54:37] left and right. And I'm just kind of like seeing stars trying to gain my composure. And then,
[01:54:42] I finally like got backed up and, and, uh, against the cage and, and, uh, gain my composure
[01:54:49] for a second, landed a one, a clean one too and, and dropped him and then ran over, like got excited
[01:54:56] when I dropped him down kind of went over towards him and, and fucking just, I think probably
[01:55:03] my coordination was just kind of off still from just getting rocked and, and I literally just tripped
[01:55:08] right over, head over him over his body. And then as we're both standing up, he fucking threw
[01:55:15] another punch and, that was it. So, and I was just like, God damn it, I'm a fucking navy seal on
[01:55:23] a army base, like fighting in an American-like Speedo, a national TV and just got knocked the
[01:55:29] fuck out. Yeah. Good toss. Yeah. I don't know what to tell you. Yeah. No, that's, that's
[01:55:40] what I'm saying, man, you're getting out there. Hey, yeah, that's what you got to do. There's, there's, there's
[01:55:44] going to be a winner to lose or, and if you, the real losers are the ones that are actually
[01:55:50] not getting in the ring. So, you know, a lot, a lot more times than that, I've come out victorious.
[01:55:55] So, uh, it is what it is. I don't, it didn't slow me down, doesn't bump me out or whatever, just
[01:56:02] part of it. And I, I understand that going into it, so risk them all to take.
[01:56:07] Yeah, what's your next fight? Um, we're setting up one, uh, looking at August 25th and, uh,
[01:56:13] Riverside, hopefully, with the LFA. So, hopefully that goes through and, and I'll be,
[01:56:20] I'll set to go, right? Any idea on a pony yet? No. I don't care who it is. Just, I just want someone.
[01:56:27] Yeah. I don't care. Like, I, I never really care who my opponent is. Honestly, I don't,
[01:56:32] I don't look at, really, their skillset or I never have really, I don't care because
[01:56:39] I've dealt with people just so much in, like, combatives and, and jujitsu and fighting, it's just, like,
[01:56:46] people are unpredictable. And that's what I stick with. Like, you may think you have a game plan
[01:56:53] figured out and then all of a sudden they do something different. And I don't even want to be thinking
[01:56:57] about, oh, well, I thought you was going to do this. And I had this set up for this. And,
[01:57:01] you know what I mean? Like, I know what you mean. I will say this when you find out who your
[01:57:06] opponent is. You got to watch him. You got to watch him. You got to at least figure out because
[01:57:11] there's people that have things. They have their game. And if they have that game and you,
[01:57:16] and you know about it, as you know, like if, if you know, I'm good at whatever, you'll defend that thing.
[01:57:23] Right? And if you don't know it, well, then I'll get you in that situation, right? If you really
[01:57:29] let's like, um, what, what, anybody, anybody, if you, everyone's got that thing at their game that they're
[01:57:34] good at, right? And like, in jjitsu, hey, this guy's got a good gaiting. This guy's got a good on him.
[01:57:39] This guy's got a good, good, heal hooks or whatever. Everyone's got their little thing. And if they're
[01:57:44] good at it, then that's what they'll kind of steer you towards. But, um, yeah, so I was, and, and I
[01:57:53] would say, look, I get it. We don't care the opponent is, but when you find out who you're
[01:57:58] opponent is, take a look, you know, send it to me. Let me look at, you know what I mean? Because
[01:58:03] I've been watching these, for sure. Things forever to say, hey, looks like this guy's got this.
[01:58:08] And you also have to watch more than, you know, watch like three or four fights and see if they
[01:58:12] have any grappling tournaments that are posted on, Nagar or whatever on YouTube, you know, you find
[01:58:17] out what kind of game they have. And if you can do that, then you can learn from it, and you can take it into
[01:58:21] the, you can take it into the cage with you. Yeah, no, I, I'm definitely not opposed to doing that at all.
[01:58:27] I just, uh, I just don't put all my eggs in the back of you. You know what I mean? And that
[01:58:33] way, I don't, if, if shit doesn't go according to plan, like, that's cool. Because they're just
[01:58:37] evolved to. Yeah, they're going to evolve, but guess what they'll go back to, they'll go back to
[01:58:42] what they're good at. Right. I mean, so that's another thing to think about. And cool. Um,
[01:58:48] I, uh, so that glory, that actual story, um, when I had gotten told know, uh, that I wasn't able
[01:58:58] to do that fucking event in, in Hampton Road, so I was, I was really bummed out and, uh, so I ended up
[01:59:04] actually just come like, I, I already like had decided at that point. I was like, you know,
[01:59:08] it fucked up. So I'm getting out of the Navy. Like, I'm, I don't want, I don't want to be told
[01:59:13] what I can't, I can't do or whatever, you know what I mean? Like, and, uh, so I called the, the guy back
[01:59:20] and said, well, when's it in next one? And he was like, oh, we got it, we got another one coming
[01:59:25] up in San Diego. And I said, put me on that one. And so I just took leave and, like, I'm just going
[01:59:31] to San Diego and I ended up fighting on the glory court. San Diego, I just took leave and
[01:59:37] went now there and did it anyway. And, uh, ended up knocking the guy out in the second round.
[01:59:42] Right, all. Yeah, that's pretty good outcome. Well, this is a pretty good spot.
[01:59:47] Since we're up to current events, what else, I know you got your supplement company, you got T-shirts,
[01:59:52] what else, how can people support what you got going on? Um, I would say, uh, the biggest, uh,
[01:59:58] big sways, probably on Instagram. Um, that's my, really my only platform. Uh, I put out a lot of
[02:00:04] content on Instagram. I do, uh, my live streams from there. I thought about doing a podcast as well,
[02:00:10] but, uh, I think I'm just going to stick to my Instagram lives and just kind of treat them as podcasts
[02:00:15] or whatever, uh, because I like talking and interacting with, with my supporters a lot. And, uh,
[02:00:22] you know, so I figure people will get bored just talking to me for a long time in a room like this.
[02:00:29] I don't know. But, uh, yeah, I would say, uh, follow me on Instagram at, uh, at Mitch Aguar.
[02:00:36] Um, and yeah, we've got a supplement company, um, our main product is a thing called this
[02:00:45] smashing greens. What I gave you today. Yeah. And, uh, that, that actually is a blend of different
[02:00:52] organic superfoods. Um, so I watched this documentary called Fat Sick and Nearly Dead.
[02:00:59] I don't know if you've seen it or not. I have not. It's on Netflix. And, uh, this guy, he, he was
[02:01:04] really overweight and had this some sort of skin disease and he ended up getting a juicer and ended up
[02:01:11] doing 60 days of just vegetable juice. And, uh, he ended up losing a ton of weight and, um,
[02:01:19] his skin disease cleared up and just like the doctors were just like blown away at at how
[02:01:26] healthy he had become, you know, just from, from doing all this and learned about micro nutrients and
[02:01:31] all this stuff. So I was like, man, that seems like a cool, uh, cool thing. Like, I want to try it,
[02:01:38] you know, I've never fasted before or anything like that. And, uh, went out and bought a juicer and
[02:01:43] it was, it was, uh, fucking pain in the ass to clean that thing, like three times a day and I was
[02:01:51] having, I had to buy like $30 worth of vegetables every day to make enough juice to, you know, put
[02:01:57] into a glass that would somewhat keep me full. And I was just like, there's gotta be a better way than
[02:02:03] this shit. And so, uh, ended up going to a vitamin shop and saw, like, organic freeze-dried wheat
[02:02:14] grass. And you just had water to it and I was like, oh my god, that's so much better, you know. So
[02:02:18] I went and basically picked out a bunch of ingredients that I did research on that, you know,
[02:02:24] things that I wanted and, um, and, uh, put them all into, like, a shaker cup and added water and
[02:02:34] drank it and did it a fast that way. And, uh, it was obviously much cheaper, much better, like,
[02:02:41] just more, way more convenient and everything like that. And I just didn't have anything
[02:02:46] in post on Instagram one day. And, uh, and so I just shared it. I was just like, hey, this is kind of
[02:02:52] the concoction that I came up with. And, and I do my, I do a five day fast like this and,
[02:02:59] just kind of, it makes me feel good, helps me lose weight. And then I started doing that, like,
[02:03:03] cutting weight for my fights. And, um, and then people, it just fucking caught on, like, wildfire.
[02:03:11] Like, everyone was like, what is that? What is that? And then, I was like, look, I'm not associated
[02:03:16] with these companies at all, you know, like, these aren't, I don't get it paid for this. Like,
[02:03:20] this is just, here, this is what I do and, like, put it, laid it all out there and it's like,
[02:03:25] you can get all these products on Amazon or your local vitamin shop or whatever. And just made it as
[02:03:31] idiot proof as I could. And I was just getting bombarded with questions nonstop. But, but it was,
[02:03:37] like, a lot of people were having, like, a ton of success fasting with that and losing weight.
[02:03:43] So, I was like, well, that's pretty cool. You know, like, I'm, I'm really, I'm down to help people,
[02:03:47] you know, better themselves and I enjoy, like, pushing people and pushing myself and trying to be
[02:03:53] better and everything. So, um, so I stuck with it and just kept, kept answering all the questions
[02:03:59] or whatever and then after, like, a year and a half or so, ended up, um, making my own, you know,
[02:04:05] just like, well, I might as well fucking make this my own product. And so I found a way to, to kind of
[02:04:11] make that come to life and, um, took all those products basically and just put them into one,
[02:04:17] removed all the fillers and all the bullshit in there and just, it was like, you know, I didn't know
[02:04:22] anything about the supplement industry or anything like that. I just never intended on, on doing that,
[02:04:29] but just kind of came about and, uh, you know, delivered a product that was way more convenient.
[02:04:36] And everyone was already using and buying all these other things. And now, now it's like my product
[02:04:42] and they're able to support me and now it's like, I don't, you know, I don't have an issue answering
[02:04:48] these questions now that you're buying my product, you know what I mean? So, um, now it's, it's been
[02:04:55] super awesome because we've had just a ton of people lose so much weight and like my brother
[02:05:02] lost 110 pounds, you know, using that. So it really works which is cool, you know, and it's really
[02:05:10] helpful for people and it's changing their lives and like I'm all about that. And now like,
[02:05:16] it's supporting me financially now that I'm not out, you know, in the Navy anymore because I didn't,
[02:05:21] I didn't get a retirement or anything like that. Just got out. So, um, so yeah, it's super cool and
[02:05:27] the supplement in a company, but now that I've been in it for a little while, like,
[02:05:34] I'm starting to get more understanding of it and, and we're, we're doing pre-workout,
[02:05:42] protein, BCA's, all that stuff like kind of expanding it and, and, you know, now I'm like really
[02:05:49] involved with it and, and I'm just treating it like everything else, like I always tried to, you know,
[02:05:57] under promise and over deliver and like I always want to make sure that like people are getting,
[02:06:04] like, or something good, you know, I don't want to ever feel like I jipped someone or got one over,
[02:06:10] something like that. Like when people come to use my products, like I want them to be, like a
[02:06:15] fucking satisfied. Yeah, for sure. That's the best policy to have, make the best stuff. Yeah,
[02:06:20] stuff just don't skip, you know, like my, my, my end game is not to make the most profit, like I
[02:06:28] want an actual good fucking product, like that, my name's behind, you know, and I proud of.
[02:06:33] What's the, what's the website? Um, you can either go to smashinfrog.com or massive supplements.com,
[02:06:42] msfsublements.com, either one they go to the same place, but yeah, and we got t-shirts and stuff,
[02:06:51] but I'm basically streamlining my t-shirts, because I had massive apparel, and I just made a
[02:06:59] bunch of t-shirts that that I wanted to make, you know, that were like personal in the me,
[02:07:05] like the mindset is everything, attitude is contagious. Don't be a pussy, be humble, you know,
[02:07:10] these are shirts that like, I've kind of made all the shirts that I want to make, and I made them.
[02:07:14] I was kind of a t-shirt snob before I had my company, and then once I made my company and like
[02:07:21] got into the apparel industry, like I just wanted like really comfortable, nice fitting,
[02:07:26] good quality t-shirts, and printed my own shit on them, and that's all I wear now, but I'm just
[02:07:33] streamlining it down a couple that I like, and I'm actually launching a new brand pretty soon that I'm
[02:07:41] very excited about. Cool, cool, right on there. So if you follow me on Instagram, you'll, uh, you can
[02:07:47] keep up with all that stuff I got going on, and and watch my future fights, and hopefully I don't get
[02:07:54] knocked out. Echo, you got anything? What happened with that dodgeball fight? You're talking about
[02:08:03] how man, uh, it was oddly enough, it was in a church also, so I got into a dodgeball church fight.
[02:08:11] Dodgeball church, did you win that one? I did, and knock the guys to you though. We were there to
[02:08:20] practice our dodgeball, and we were taking it very seriously, you know, because there was a
[02:08:26] tournament coming up that I think had like a $500 prize, which when you're like $16, $500 is
[02:08:34] $1,000,000,000. Yeah, that'll go long way. It'll go a long way. So, you know, the stakes were high, and
[02:08:40] we were, we were there, and there was some local jokers that were just, you know, not
[02:08:48] taking it seriously, and like just fucking with our practice and stuff, and, and...
[02:08:53] dude, if there's one thing that makes me angry, legitimately angry, so people aren't taking dodgeball
[02:08:57] series. You know, it just was. It was, there was a time for joking around, there was a time for
[02:09:04] seriousness, and you know, that wasn't the time, and ended up, you know, I ended up saying something
[02:09:09] to this dude, and just, you just kind of fucking mouth-off, and, you know, my temper's,
[02:09:15] temper's flared, and escalated, yeah, things escalated, and ended up getting into like a full-on
[02:09:21] brawl. Like a dodgy brawl, dodgy brawl, and a dodgy brawl. That's brawl. It's dodgy brawl.
[02:09:28] There you go. So, thank you. It's a good time. Well, awesome. Um, hey, speaking of fighting,
[02:09:36] and smashing things, sure. I mean, echo, yes. We want to be better at fighting. We want to be
[02:09:44] better at living. What do you got? What do you got for us? I got a few things. So, we'll start with
[02:09:50] judgy stew, right? You're like geared, no ghee better. Um, I'm starting to like, no ghee,
[02:09:59] better. I would say just because I feel like it's more applicable to the cage. However, um, you know,
[02:10:07] like Jako was saying earlier, I agree, wholeheartedly, I think that everyone who trains judgy
[02:10:13] stew should train in a ghee as well because, you know, there are a lot of similarities, and I feel like if you
[02:10:20] only train no ghee, and then you go against someone with a put a ghee on with any sort of decent
[02:10:27] skill level, you're going to get fucking choked for sure. Yeah. And it just the ghee slows everything down,
[02:10:34] and it's a, it's a totally different animal. And the thing is, like, you can train in a ghee all the time,
[02:10:41] and take the ghee off and roll with someone no ghee, and you're, you're going to do fine. You're
[02:10:46] you're still doing judgy stew, you know what I mean? It's a different game, but it's not that much different,
[02:10:51] but going from no ghee to ghee, very different. So, that's why I think I think people should
[02:10:58] definitely train in a ghee still. Yeah, agree. Yeah, both is best for sure. Um, yeah, the ghee,
[02:11:04] I add these elements that if you only train no ghee, you're not used to those elements, and if
[02:11:08] someone else is used to those elements, all the no ghee elements are in the ghee, you know,
[02:11:14] like those elements are there for the most part. Of course, in the close, you know, like,
[02:11:18] using like, if you were getting a street fight, like you can use clothes like a ghee. Right. So it
[02:11:23] gives you even that many more options for sure. Oh, yeah, agree. Well, speaking of ghee,
[02:11:28] well, ghee, we're going to get everyone's doing judgets, you know, I feel like it's growing
[02:11:33] essentially. So, kind of ghee, we get an origin ghee. You know, why are we getting origin
[02:11:37] ghee because they're made in America? And they are factually the best ghee in the world.
[02:11:42] Rashcards as well. Okay. So where do we get them at originmain.com? That's also where we're
[02:11:48] getting genes. Yeah. By the way. And I got mine. By the way, approval level 100. You know,
[02:11:56] always reluctant to say, you know, 101% approval, but here I'm going to say it 101% approval,
[02:12:01] because they exceeded literally exceeded my expectations. And your expectations were high.
[02:12:05] Warrior 100%. I was like, yeah, the way you're talking the way they, you know,
[02:12:08] PD does a good job in building these things up. You know, he's taking close-up pictures of the buttons
[02:12:13] coming out of the factory that it's really good. So I'm like, all right, expectation, expectation level is high.
[02:12:19] 100%. These have to be five star genes essentially. They're like five star plus some added
[02:12:24] things that I was impressed with. Yes. 101% approval. Yes. So genes, you can get them t-shirts,
[02:12:31] trashcarts, supplements, supplements. Yes. So, well kind of supplements, joint warfare,
[02:12:38] which I'm happy with, man, I've been on the joint warfare. I think it's been one year consistent
[02:12:42] joint warfare, cruel oil. So approved 100% approved. Actually adding value, providing value,
[02:12:50] even beyond what you might think in the beginning. Because you know, one, you know, one, we're
[02:12:54] young, you know, young guys or whatever, you don't care, you know, you have muscle soreness,
[02:12:59] you have all this stuff. What are the joint soreness is one of those things that just kind of creeps up on you.
[02:13:04] But if you're on top of that, that doesn't take you. It'll take you out of the game if you're not ready.
[02:13:08] Preventative. Yeah. And when it comes to my idea, I'd get like elbow stuff from lifting and stuff.
[02:13:14] But if, if I was on like joint warfare, glucose, me and could join any, any one of these things
[02:13:20] that they did recommend when I started grappling, by the way, if I was on that, I would have never got out of the
[02:13:25] game. Yeah, at any point. The last point is get your joint warfare, get your cruel oil and stay on that.
[02:13:32] Get your discipline too. Yeah. Fully. Get your discipline. Discipline is like all day.
[02:13:37] Now. Yes, sir. That's kind of where it's going. It's, yeah. It's like, yes, I guess what I'm just
[02:13:42] drinking. Oh, I'm just going to have some discipline. Right. It's kind of like you poured this,
[02:13:47] uh, is this what you're talking about? Yeah. Yeah. It's just tastiness and goodness.
[02:13:51] Commission is this a pre-workout. Yeah. It's, it's not like a super um, there's not like a super
[02:13:58] caffeinated deal because I don't drink a lot of caffeine and I don't want to drink a lot of caffeine.
[02:14:02] So yeah, you, little cognitive, little physical. Okay. And you, uh, just sip this all day.
[02:14:10] Yeah. I don't have like some. And I won't drink it like after dinner, you know, because I,
[02:14:16] there's a little bit of caffeine in it and I don't drink a lot of caffeine. So not even in the
[02:14:20] mornings when you, when you're waking up. No. Is that 430? Just a little bit of a little bit of a
[02:14:24] t t to the white t has some caffeine in it too. So I guess I do drink caffeine. But I don't drink
[02:14:30] high doses like like a like a monster energy drink or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Speaking of energy
[02:14:37] drink, we got to energy drink on my own. But it's, it's actually good for you, which is completely,
[02:14:44] it's like we, it's hard to call it an energy drink because energy drink puts it in a, in a
[02:14:52] category with things that are actually horrible for you. Yeah. Right. Like there's normal energy
[02:14:57] drinks that are just horrible for you. This is something that you can legitimately just drink and it's
[02:15:01] good for you. Yeah. So that's coming out. You'll see some cans of that in the near future. Oh yeah. That's
[02:15:07] a good one. Oh, the milk. You want to desert. If you want extra protein in the form of
[02:15:15] we desert that that's it. Milk. Off-livers. I like that just like if you want to desert. You have a mint chocolate
[02:15:21] protein right? I was, I have a mint chocolate protein as well. And I was, my, my protein or
[02:15:29] my supplements took a long time to come out like way, I'm sure you've encountered whenever
[02:15:35] you're dealing with any kind of putting out something. Never goes according to plan and it's always
[02:15:41] longer than you're expecting or whatever. And I had done a mint chocolate. I, that was just,
[02:15:47] I've been a huge fan of mint my whole life, mint chocolate, whatever. Me too. Me deliciousness.
[02:15:52] And, uh, and I saw that you put out a mint chocolate and I was like, God damn it, everyone is going
[02:15:57] to think I'll copy chocolate. I don't have the pack. You're in a chocolate. Yeah. Or they'll probably
[02:16:02] think like dang. I thought I was the only one who loved mint chocolate better than everything I was
[02:16:07] like, you know, we all kind of do mint chocolate with a seals, but like you're just two,
[02:16:12] but like mint chocolate. Yeah. Well same thing with Pete, right? I mean not another name
[02:16:16] seal thing, but wait was he in mint chocolate or peanut butter? He was in the mint, but I think
[02:16:21] peanut butter. See, the peanut butter was kind of like that. Yeah, that's not where. Well,
[02:16:26] that's sort of smashing. Well, yeah, and that makes sense because in my opinion, you know, I'm not
[02:16:31] just going to like, my favorite dessert is this or that. I'm not that, you know, but I will say that
[02:16:37] when you came out, it's almost like, you're going public with your mint chocolate, uh, love, um,
[02:16:42] admiration. I was like, hey, me too, but peanut butter chocolate has always been my close close
[02:16:49] second. Yeah. Easy money. But the one that really, the strawberry, because it's just so,
[02:16:55] yeah, good. Oh yeah, but it's strawberry is a staple anyway, you know, it's like staple everything,
[02:17:00] but so it's vanilla, but I'm not over here. I'm not over here jumping up and down about vanilla.
[02:17:05] Yeah, but some people are. I know some people are. I've got a cinnamon toast crunch.
[02:17:09] There you go. Coming out, and I've got to think of a name for it because I don't think I can
[02:17:14] legally call it cinnamon toast crunch. No, I don't know. I don't know what the rules are.
[02:17:19] I thought about thinking of, you know, growing up, uh, I always hit, we were kind of not so, uh,
[02:17:25] financially gifted. Yeah. I'm gonna call that, whatever, living in a trailer. You know, my mom would
[02:17:32] always get fruity dino bites, you know, and cinnamon toast squares. I used to eat those out of the bag.
[02:17:42] That's not what the other kids eat. Yeah, once I joined the Navy and started getting, you know,
[02:17:50] good paycheck. I just, I never, you know, I never again. I always appreciated my serial game.
[02:17:57] It was always the good. The real stuff. Fruity pebbles. There's no fruity dino bites in this house.
[02:18:04] Get out of here with that. Yeah. Come to the bag. Right. The speed to that. Little kids need food.
[02:18:10] That's why I got Warrior Kid Mulk, strawberry, chocolate. Yeah. Let them eat and be healthy.
[02:18:16] They've got that chocolate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My wife gets like, like, she hits a point in the
[02:18:23] day where she's like, man, I'm considering just to go to bed right now or to bust out a
[02:18:28] chocolate tea and just get after it. Literally says that. Decision point. Yeah. And I know the feeling,
[02:18:33] but man, she's really committed to it. You got to take her go to. You got to take something
[02:18:37] or make creative supplement of some kind for a little power nap. Because working on it. You know,
[02:18:43] I did start a rumor that you take naps. No, I freely admit that. Yeah. It's really, yeah.
[02:18:48] It's very open about it. I wrote about it. I wrote about it. In the dismissal free and field
[02:18:53] medieval. Yeah. I mean, if I'm really tired, I elevate my feet above my heart. And I sat in the
[02:18:58] alarm and I'll sleep for eight minutes and eight minutes. Yeah. Power now. Yep. And if you go,
[02:19:03] I mean, sometimes I go 10. But if you start going 15, 20, then you're like legitimately,
[02:19:08] you'll feel groggy. But you know the deal, man, from like you're talking about sleeping in a helicopter.
[02:19:13] Like you wake up from those things. You're totally on fire. You know, it's a sleep for 10 minutes,
[02:19:17] eight minutes, whatever. So yeah, I have no problem with this. The problem with me is, I don't know,
[02:19:23] I tend to nap better than I sleep. And then like when I wake up, my brain just starts going.
[02:19:31] And it just once that happens, it's just, that's it. I'm up.
[02:19:35] So when you say a supplement for power and after it like helps you get into like power and
[02:19:40] up state like that, okay? I don't know. I'm working it. It could be your your cinnamon
[02:19:48] toast crunch flavored situation. Have you taken hypnosis? Uh-huh. Yeah, so origin. So we have,
[02:19:55] we have this thing called hypnosis, which is like a sleep. But yeah, but that's not for now.
[02:19:59] I'm not sure about it. Yeah, you need some of that. You need some of that. Just for eight minutes.
[02:20:03] It's you take a rail of it and you're out for eight minutes, just fully reach out. I'm working on it.
[02:20:08] I'm working on it. Well, wait, but technically and I don't know, this just seems like this is true.
[02:20:13] Power and app. Can you know, you have like what the five phases right of sleep? Yeah,
[02:20:17] or six five versus. I don't either. Yeah, what should I have in some. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah. So you
[02:20:22] can have, you probably get jammed up somewhere in one of those stages, right? Power and app is stage one.
[02:20:28] I think I'm pretty sure it's only stage one. Power and app. I depends on how tired you are.
[02:20:33] Well, then it won't be considered a power and app. If you're like super tired and you go boom all the way
[02:20:37] phase stage five sleep. Right. You went to the idea of sleep. Yeah. Do you have sleep back?
[02:20:41] Yeah, or anything? Nope. No. Yeah. I don't have, I did a sleep study and I don't have sleep
[02:20:46] apnea, but I have insomnia. And it's like I wake up enough not to actually wake me up, but like
[02:20:52] it's like I wake up. No, and even no, I'm awake. Oh, you know what I mean? So I wake up. When I do wake up,
[02:20:58] I'm fucking still exhausted. Yeah. It's great. So one of the, I actually have a CBD line as well,
[02:21:08] which I don't know if you get into the CBD at all. Not really, no. No. But one of the products that
[02:21:15] that we're launching is a thing called green dreams. And it's rapid dissolve. It's a rapid dissolve
[02:21:22] tablet. You put on your tongue and dissolves in like 10 seconds and it's 25 milligrams of CBD and 10
[02:21:29] milligrams of melatonin. So, but that's not for an eight minute. Yeah. That's a good power now. That's
[02:21:37] the going to bed situation. Yeah. That's a good bed situation. That's a good bed situation. Very nice. Right
[02:21:42] all. Well, the opposite of that is Jokwaiti because you don't take that before you go to bed. Maybe
[02:21:46] after you wake up the middle of the day like my wife or whatever. Also, if you're into deadlifting,
[02:21:51] which we all are, of course, it'll increase it to 8,000 pounds, proving by the way double-blind,
[02:21:57] triple placebo situation. No joke. Also, we have our own store. Jokwaiti's store. It's called
[02:22:04] Jokwaiti's store. We got rash guards. We do. I'm sure. Yeah. T-shirts. You want to represent
[02:22:10] while on the path. Oh, there are. Truckers hats. Yeah. For those of us that like truckers like
[02:22:16] truckers hats, which apparently we do. They're nice. One size fits all. There you go. What about
[02:22:21] FlexFit? I did the FlexFit for a while, but you know, I got a small head. Wait, FlexFit has two sizes,
[02:22:28] though. I know. Yeah. So you're ready to get the small medium or the large XL. I don't know nothing
[02:22:33] about the, you're not even about that at all. Don't know anything about it. Turn your back to it.
[02:22:36] Putty's hat, snob, or your. Yeah, hoodies lightweight. And do you find youth for lightweight,
[02:22:43] pretty? Definitely all the time. You're around. Yes, sir. I agree. No, I don't
[02:22:47] want to agree with that one. Do they have a nipers? Yeah. Some of the, well, yes. So the ones we
[02:22:52] have, yes, they have a zipper. I'm a fan of the zipper. The zipper light hoodie with the pockets.
[02:22:58] I agree. I honestly, I don't even have any of my own in my apparel line at the moment, but
[02:23:04] I'm a fan of those. Yeah. Big enough. Yeah. Well, thank you. Dang. You know, I mean, I'm
[02:23:09] to see their teacher or heavy hoodie. That's a real. Yeah. All functional. And I get it.
[02:23:14] You know, but that's like a gift. I'm a zip. A zip that a non or a zipping lightweight.
[02:23:20] I'm a fucking little bit. Yeah. Play some warm guard without. For sure. And, you know,
[02:23:26] hopefully it looks good. Hopefully you like the design. But you will be representing while you're
[02:23:31] on the path. Not a good stuff on their jocco store.com. Some patches on there too. I reordered
[02:23:37] some more patches. They're coming in. I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I don't want to go too
[02:23:43] deep into it. But it resulted in your patches not being available for a little while. They're
[02:23:49] going to be available. You know, you can't buy what's not available. Yeah. Good. Yeah. That's what
[02:23:54] they're telling me too. And I was like, dang, okay. All right. So, you know, you learn something new every
[02:23:58] day. And, you know, speaking of which right on top of things. Trying to be trying to be,
[02:24:03] but anyway, smash the like button. Oh my god. I keep saying that to me. Oh, she doesn't even know
[02:24:11] what that may. I think she have way knows what that means. She's like smash the like button. I was
[02:24:15] like, right, the video that you're pretending to make doesn't even have a like button. No, no,
[02:24:19] you need to just, I got to cut it out. No, no, no, I got to stop her from saying that. That's what
[02:24:23] I can say. But if you're in the mood to smash the like button, if you want to subscribe to this podcast,
[02:24:28] you can. So do that if you want. On wherever you listen to podcasts. Don't forget about the
[02:24:33] Warrior Kid podcast, which there are now three new Warrior Kid podcast live at this time.
[02:24:41] Yeah, good one. Stories from Uncle Jake. Yeah. Stories that teach lessons on interview with
[02:24:46] John Bozack, the Warrior Kid artists that drew Mike in the Dragons talking about how to get
[02:24:52] better at art. How to use art as a tool to better it other things. Yeah. That was good. And those good
[02:25:00] that those like, are you, do you do any art? I didn't draw in my books. No, but I mean, yeah, I can draw.
[02:25:08] He sent me a man and I'm going to post this online. Everybody can oil paintings.
[02:25:12] Oh, for real? Yeah, like, have you? Have you been into that for like a long time? Is that like a new
[02:25:17] situation? I did my first painting in 2000 Easter of 2016. Yeah. It's what kind of new.
[02:25:24] Oh, yeah. It's not like, oh, when I was three, I did my name on definitely not. Jockel has the original
[02:25:31] logo where I have the original logo of Eschalon front. Jockel's design. Actually, these lines some
[02:25:37] other stuff too. Yeah. That's hard to quit. So he drew it. Right. But so, the disconnect was that I drew it.
[02:25:45] I didn't draw with my hand. I drew it on the computer. Like, I drew it on PowerPoint. Like,
[02:25:51] it's so bad. Wait, it's so funny because when I first go and he first sent it to me, I'm like,
[02:25:56] I, of course, you drew it on PowerPoint. You know, it's not like you have one of those
[02:26:01] pads and stuff. You're Jockel. You don't have that kind of stuff. So, but it's not as obvious when you
[02:26:06] get it. You just get the finished product and it literally looks like my daughter drew it with her
[02:26:09] left hand. She's right at it. By the way. And, but the concept was legitimate. It was sound. That's like
[02:26:14] what the National Unfront logo is at this time. So you're pushing and men received. But the
[02:26:20] story is I tried to explain it to you nine different times and you kept sending me back
[02:26:26] junk. Yeah. Well, I mean, I said, okay, pictures worth a thousand words. I don't feel like
[02:26:31] explaining this a thousand times. Let's just send them a rudimentary sketch of the concept,
[02:26:38] which you then chisel about into, you know, glory. Yeah. emphasis on rudimentary, by the way,
[02:26:45] but the comedic part of it is how it looked. It looked like a child drew it. So now, anytime,
[02:26:50] like, if you ask, why have you been into art? Boom, that flashes in my head and he says,
[02:26:54] yes, boom, makes it more funny. I'm going to post it online so we all can have a good laugh.
[02:27:00] Unless, yes, work it about gases out. That interview with John Bozac is very good. Like,
[02:27:06] especially like, because it is he talks about getting like frustrated with stuff. And so that's
[02:27:09] all just for him. It's a little kid's job. It was good. Don't forget about where your kid's soap
[02:27:14] from Irish Oaks Ranch.com that young Aiden is making on his farm. If you get soap, you can
[02:27:21] stay clean. Of course. Also, we have a YouTube channel. If you're interested in the video version,
[02:27:27] you're going to see what Mitch looks like. Hell yeah, I'm handsome. You might be the buffist
[02:27:35] guess we were at right? buffist guess? Yeah, out of 185. Yeah, we've only had like probably
[02:27:42] 10 or 15. Yeah. I don't get it. Don't get it. So yeah, yeah, I don't get it. You know how many
[02:27:47] fucking times people, you, Tim Kennedy need to fight. And I'm like, have you seen Tim Kennedy's way
[02:27:54] bigger than me first of all? Fight to 85. I know. Yeah. And what do you fight at? 70, yeah.
[02:28:00] I have fought at 185 as well as a champion at 185 too. I walk around close to 200. Yeah,
[02:28:10] that was. No, Tim is like 215. He's a big dude. I've met him. Just in passing.
[02:28:18] shook his hand one time. But yeah, he's a big dude. I was always told me like that's not
[02:28:25] where you have like kind of like similar stories. Like there's it wouldn't make sense for us,
[02:28:30] stuff like that. Yeah, we just want to see. Yeah, see what a cycle of the warfare is an album with
[02:28:37] tracks. Wait, wait, no, back to YouTube. We have a YouTube channel. I'm going to, I'm going to,
[02:28:42] what do you, what I call explain the value of YouTube? You just did. You can see what Mitch looks
[02:28:46] like. That's just part of the value. That's just like a big part. I mean, that was going to
[02:28:50] shake. Don't, don't, don't undersell that. Yeah, it's huge. But, you know, we have to
[02:28:54] mix our son there's what I was going to say. You know, if you don't watch the whole,
[02:28:58] I'd guess there's excerpts on there. Anyway, I'm going to get some of them are enhanced by
[02:29:02] echo. Yeah. Who puts his artwork onto the video and they might be slightly better than my
[02:29:09] original echelon front logo. Yeah. And maybe a little bit better. That is, I'm over enhanced.
[02:29:15] Yes, some people think. Yes. Some people think they're under enhanced. Yes. Oh,
[02:29:19] the group. Regardless. No less. We have a YouTube channel. That's the point. Yeah. If you want to,
[02:29:24] you can smash, like, let it, sure comment, subscribe, whatever the three things it was in.
[02:29:33] Anyway, yeah, psychological warfare is an album with tracks. If you're,
[02:29:35] grinding into moments of weakness, put in psychological warfare, you'll, it'll solve your
[02:29:40] problem. No weakness. Weakness overcome. If you want the visual version of that, go to flipsidecampus.com.
[02:29:49] My brother Dakota Meyer has a little company where he's making things that you hang on your wall.
[02:29:57] Artistic. Some people call him artistic things. And you can get those. If you want him to make a special one.
[02:30:04] Yeah. Hit him up on Twitter. Do some custom events. Like, if it seems to get some traction,
[02:30:10] yeah, he can put it out. Yeah, he's good. He's doing good stuff. Yeah. On there. Yeah. I
[02:30:15] took him out from time to time. Flipsidecampus.com. Dude, yeah. Also on it. So you got to on it.
[02:30:21] .com slash jockey. You get a lot of good stuff on there, including kettlebells, other work out
[02:30:25] stuff and bring my room. I'm going to Hawaii by the way for one month. I know people people really
[02:30:32] don't, they, they undersell Hawaii. I feel like I feel that with the same way when I went there
[02:30:37] for the first time I was blown away. Where'd you go? Maui and uh, uh, Hawaii. I'm going to
[02:30:44] go. Yeah. One month. I heard that's beautiful. Yes sir. It is. So I'm bringing the rings.
[02:30:50] You're request by the way. That was one of the selling points of rings. This is that you can bring
[02:30:56] them places too. That wasn't really my request. It was a statement. Yeah. statement. Recommendation.
[02:31:01] Recommendation should be reluctant. Recommendation. You sure did. And it was a really, it was a
[02:31:04] legitimate recommendation. On the last, I'm taking it. I'm taking them to Hawaii. Anyway,
[02:31:08] point is the rings I have from on it. You can get those. You can get kettlebells. You can get.
[02:31:13] I have this K. They have this mineral electrolyte, uh, like mix. Right. And I think I might have just
[02:31:20] enhanced what I call the mega mix. It's the pre-workout mega mix. There's two. There's one for
[02:31:24] G just one for lifting. The one for G just to his disobey one scoop of discipline. A little bit of
[02:31:30] gatorade. So it's a half gatorade half water mix. Optional gatorade. Some people don't like gatorade.
[02:31:35] Some people. Yeah. And that's cool. I don't know. But you can put lemon juice in there if you want.
[02:31:40] Sure. Um, like I said, the discipline, the electrolytes from on it. And then, uh, I want to
[02:31:46] add your greens. I'll hook you up. Yeah. That'll be the mega mega mix. That's pre-judicity.
[02:31:52] Is there a certain time where you got to take those greens? No. This whenever you get a
[02:31:55] mint, I'll dig it over there. So that's going to be the pre-judicity. The pre-lifting is essentially
[02:32:00] the same thing except you put a like a caffeinated pre-workout in it. If you're into it. Anyway.
[02:32:07] Anyway, back to on it. That's where you get it. There's a lot of cool stuff on there. You're
[02:32:10] quite a large, large human being yourself, man. Looking good. Yeah. But I don't sound big though. Thank
[02:32:15] you. I respect that. I'm sorry. Does my voice not match how I look? You know, I can't say
[02:32:23] because- Because you saw me. I saw you. You started talking. Yeah. It's kind of ingrained. Yeah.
[02:32:29] All right. There you go. Maybe not though. Had you not spoke. I'd been like, Dan. Yeah.
[02:32:35] The studio's probably fucking got a jacked voice. Yeah. Yeah. Like, talk comes into it. Yeah.
[02:32:40] But it's melodious. It's not jacked. That's all right. I have a high pitch voice.
[02:32:44] melodious. Yeah. Very melodious. Yeah. Interesting. Anyway, yeah. Got some books.
[02:32:49] Way the Warrior Kid 3. It's out. It's called the Way there's a will. Teaching kids about how to
[02:32:56] go horager. That's a little lesson in this book. Yeah. You got to push harder and also teach
[02:33:02] them about their ego and how their ego will get them in trouble. Everyone wishes they would
[02:33:07] learn about ego earlier because it makes your life better. Of course, there's a way the Warrior
[02:33:12] could want to wear the Warrior Kid to marks mission. Those books are four kids to learn to get on
[02:33:18] the path. If they're a little bit younger than that, you can get a Mikey in the dragons.
[02:33:23] They can learn about how to overcome their fear. There's actual pragmatic protocols that you can
[02:33:31] take as a human being to overcome what you're afraid of. Why not learn that when you're five years
[02:33:35] old? Yeah. That's my question. Why not? Because you didn't know about about the book Mikey
[02:33:39] in the Dragons. Now you know about it. Your kids are just out there conquering fears, which is a
[02:33:44] positive thing. Yeah. And that's a good one too because you can like, you know, if you have a
[02:33:49] bedtime routine, you can read to your, you know, four or five year old before they can read.
[02:33:54] It's one where you can read it. Not only can you read the whole thing. If you're like a 50,
[02:33:58] 50 minute, you know, but they'll want to hear it again. So it's like a, you know, so when you're
[02:34:03] really while you're reading it over and over again, that lesson won't be in, you know, ingrained
[02:34:07] and instilled deeper and deeper. Rather than just one of the many books. Reposition. Yeah. Exactly.
[02:34:12] Yeah. Then we got the disc, my disc's freedom field manual. If you go, hey, Jocco, can you post
[02:34:18] your workouts? Yes, they're in the disc, my disc's freedom field manual. Hey, Jocco, what do you
[02:34:23] think you should do in a situation like this? Oh, it's in the disc, my disc's freedom field manual.
[02:34:26] Hey, Jocco, what do you eat? It's in the manual. What's your sleep routine? It's in the manual.

[02:35:37] which is something that's hard to comprehend, how are you going to take leadership and teach people

[02:35:51] tests on it and then you get put in scenarios, interactive scenarios on the computer. We have to make decisions.
[02:35:58] So that's a EF Online, then we have the Master, which is a leadership
