you know did Jason Gardner tell that story on the podcast where the guy they were doing a debrief they're doing a debrief so Jason Gardner's like at T5 and they're doing a debrief after like a CQC kill house run or something and this young officer standing there during the debrief and he just cracks off a round like during the debrief supposed to be cleared safe he cracks off around it goes between two of the guys they're standing in a circle and he cracks off around and the dude had like an out of body experience and he looks up at the group and he says he was decarking it he says he was decarking it as if it was him that's one of my favorites stories from Gardner dude because that tells you how people get crazy they they do something and they think that it wasn't even there he's making excuse for a person that is someone else he was decarking it so there you go jumping at the sound of every outgoing or incoming artillery shell here's another good one stoner was stoner's tasking it was going through CQC training and this guy threw a crash into a room and it like he threw a crash into the room and then went in the room and then like backed out because he scared the crash because it's something weird like that where the guy was basically scared of the crash and so stoner was watching and so stoner was like they get done with the run and so he was like hey come with me and stoner got like seven crashes in his pocket and he went into like a small closet and he goes and he starts talking to the guy all normal and like like hey you know I just want to talk and as he's pulling the crash out just like undoes it and pulls the pin and just drops it at their feet and continues talking totally normal just like oh man he does that seven times and then at the end of whatever he was saying to me goes hey by the way don't be scared of crashes they're not gonna hurt you oh you're feeling a little like queasy right now feeling some butterflies that's good that's your body putting your blood into your muscles instead of to your stomach it's all good common failings says a successful third army rifle company commander the following failings are common among replacements they must be strictly and promptly eliminated if excessive casualties are to be avoided and combat efficiency obtained lack of ordinary discipline saying yeah instead of saying yes sir jumping at the sound of every outgoing or incoming artillery show we acted like we were like straight up nom like that's in a body like with the guys would show up and sometimes there'd be outgoing artillery from camp or body it's outgoing we like we're all this hard to work that's what's fun with that that's what I was gonna ask like is that a thing because like you know when you first encounter gunfire even if it's like you know the guy next year whatever shooting outgoing you know as we say it can startle you if you don't hear that all the time it's so loud so it was like the team was like kind of known for that like hey buckle up when we kick field goals or puns like this guy's coming so there was time they got to the point where they would stack that side wherever he was which is dangerous to do because you open up the other side for other guys but bro it's that important that's so good that's so good the specialized skill he had developed you know there's something to be said about this concept and specializing and focusing on something I was watching a thing about Wayne Gretzky and when he was like he would sit there and watch hockey games as a kid and while he was watching the hockey game he would trace the puck like with a pen on the on the on like a piece of paper like he draw hockey ring the desserts right that's exactly what happened what the desserts is what discipline go does to energy drinks because let's face it you kind of like the taste of an energy drink you kind of like the fact that it gets you a little amped what you don't like is you crash what you don't like is it's bad for you what you don't like is it you get that freaking jitters and what you don't like is you're giving yourself type two diabetes which also sucks that there's no reason for any that no it's like dessert you know you you you feel like crap after you eat a big whatever if we can horrible dessert filled with sugar you know you just have milk but we want you to destroy any enemy that you find that's two different things that's saying i want you to fight someone and run away from them at the same time a combat patrol executes missions which they which may require fighting to accomplish or to help accomplish every combat patrol secure information as a secondary mission then here's the comment this patrol had been given two primary missions reconnaissance and combat without any indication as to which has priority prioritize next to we need to know what the priority is the directive to destroy any enemy found in the area if taken as the primary mission will preclude successful will preclude successful operation as a reconnaissance patrol the mission should have been either combat with reconnaissance as a secondary mission or reconnaissance alone in which case the patrol would engage in combat only to the extent necessary to complete its reconnaissance mission so think about that when you're assigning someone a mission make sure they understand what the damn mission is and don't assign them two missions that are opposed to each other and when you do assign people two or three missions or tasks or projects make sure they know what the priority mission is what the priority project is the patrol departed out of the outpost at 10 15 leaving a 160 millimeter mortar squad to furnish fire support a rope secured of both banks were used to help put the patrol way across the stream by 11 15 personnel and equipment had crossed and we're waiting for scheduled artillery concentration before moving forward at 11 30 80 rounds of 105 was fired after completion of the artillery fire the patrol reconnoiided along the route to the beach except for the killing of three japs by the rear point no contact was made and the trip was on eventful and I have rank over you doesn't mean you're going to do it especially if it's going to get you killed there's a comment here and in these books they just they the sort of the authority times in the author whoever the author is the the author's chime in and they just write comment and it says comment a leader who is not gained the respect respect and confidence of his men during training has two strikes again and when he against him when he answers combat the element of doubt in the minds of his men may be the difference between success and failure of a mission gaining respect and confidence of your men how do you do that do you that by barking out of no do you that by yelling out of no you do that by listening you do that by treating them with respect here is a definition of discipline says Colonel E. L. Montz and Signal Corps true discipline is voluntary it is based on knowledge region a sense of duty and idealism a good leader develops in his men a cheerful and willing obedience that wants to respond that wants to carry out his orders this kind of discipline will in the end bring combat results as no other kind possibly can we could probably stop right here because everyone thinks when the military talks about discipline they're talking about the what if you can beat your people into submission then you're going to be good to go no that's not the kind of discipline we're talking about cheerful willing obedience that's a totally different thing willing obedience people want to carry out the orders you know totally different you don't really think of discipline associated with cheerful so I was like thinking that's freaking that's like a double double bonus scenario not only is this due down with natees which is fully approved dude he's also down with the cause which kind of tells me we're aligned with the whole like that tells me we're aligned like we we we got people you know like we're just aligned that is good and uh what did you say anything to him I just gave the bone of the ball not gave him a little bit more than that all that I was like okay then it goes into the right kind of orientation poor orientation of replacements may seriously affect the fighting ability and survival chances of men themselves and may also endanger the unit with whom they first serve for these reasons that leaders of putoan squads and companies should find out exactly what orientation and training have been given the men and should provide essential orientation on the spot in so far as practical before sending them into combat if a divisional training plan similar to that describe below is in operation the problem of inducting new members new men into smaller units is much simplified and lower unit orientation can be modified accordingly then there's an effective an effective training system described our division has received thousands of replacements since it first since it's first combat experience enormity more than 90% of these replacements have been infantry many of the replacements came into the division lacking confidence in their ability and paralyzed by the apprehension and gendered by loose talk before and upon their rival exact guys are scared shitless sometime ago we started a course of instruction for our replacements they last two and a half days and is conducted by battle experienced personnel particular emphasis is placed upon how to live in a foxhole development of an aggressive attitude the use of fragmentation grenade anti-takernade and bazooka throughout the course these men are trained in groups of 12 they are later assigned to organizations by these same groups you know what I'll tell people about is it close out here by saying we we found that this course of instruction gives replacements much greater self confidence it debunks the notions that they have picked up in the rear the course has definitely improved not only the morale but also the fighting ability of our replacements who expect to continue the plan for all replacements to come into the division you know what else you gotta tell people is like route k they take in route l one element takes out route and another element takes out so there's a lot going on in this in this patrol and I don't want to get too wrapped around trying to explain like exactly what happened without the visuals but the patrol consisted of a rifle between reinforced by two sixty millimeter mortar squads one intelligence man a radio operator an eight man second lieutenant why the platoon leader was in command first lieutenant x from wise company was attached to the patrol as observer and coordinator comment the higher commander keeps the accomplishment of the mission in mind when he selects the patrol leader the more important the mission the more careful his selection must be a good leader should have judgment initiative courage endurance and be a highly skilled leader the attachment of lieutenant x as coordinator not only divided responsibility but also indicated a doubt in the commander's mind as to wise ability to lead the patrol so you've got you've got this second lieutenant that's going out there in command and he just became a rifleman went out there and saved his guys next section's called patrol pointers commanders and staffs as well as troops should be made to realize the amount of detail essential to proper preparation of a patrol for each mission and precise the fact that the patrol leader must be given the means to end time to accomplish his mission how often do we actually think about what where it's tasking people with you got to realize what you're asking people with what time it's going to take how much time they need to prepare for contact with the main force leaders of flank and security or security patrols should be impressed with the importance of maintaining contact with the main force at all times loss of contact has often proved disastrous so you have to maintain communications the opposite extreme there we got a little dichotomy going here the opposite extreme however can also have serious results one patrol leader over zealous about maintaining contact cause the attack to involve the main body and develop into a major action for which the latter was not prepared so this guy kept everyone so close that by the time they did the assault the main body got caught up in the assault as well and you do not want to split forces in the first place and you definitely want to split forces into three groups and you definitely don't want to split forces into three groups and you all wounded and you've already been attacked by a fifty man enemy force this is crazy the comment the patrol must be directed regulated and controlled at all times patrol members must be familiar with all prescribed signals the leader may arrange for a few additional signals for special purposes in this instance and in this instance the loss of control can undoubtedly be attributed to the poor chain of command in the patrol organization to sudden change in command from lieutenant y to lieutenant ex while the patrol is in and contact with the enemy and to a failure to reach clear understanding of plans and signals you can see how these little compounding problems and if you look at your organization if you look at what you're doing inside of your business what little what little mistakes are you making what little what little things are you compounding what problems do you have that can be compounding that can lead to disaster is it communication is it chain of command are you not mutually supporting each other do people not understand what the mission is you see this applies to everything that we do with any kind of team the trip back the platoon sergeant with his 13 men followed the route yeah you like the I like the name too here's the thing about the shirt locker for people because people people are saying hey like can I get that one design those like two months ago it's a good design for sure we can't that was like if you have the membership you'll get the design for that month oh oh well unwillingness to use the rifle many have been told never to fire without direct orders for fear of revealing positions lack of pride in self organization or work poor physical condition a tendency to bunch together when in danger I wrote about that in leadership strategy and tactics not just from a battlefield but also from a mental status we all just want to like crowd each other we get we get we feel comfort being next to each other don't freezing under fire slavin slavinliness in care of equipment lack of skill with the rifle or other infantry weapons fear of the night ignorance of squad formations ignorance of field sanitation and of personal hygiene combat comment replacement to exhibit these deficiencies usually have usually not had the advantage of such training system as described above so think about how you're indoctrinating your people you can probably do a better job of it the next section is about river crossing as it goes by this whole this is these are tactical things trying to help people win this war these are tactical things about literally how to cross rivers very cold a read I'm not gonna cover it right now it covers assault boat handling and water safety and foot bridges and cable bridges and engineer bridges it just goes on all these detailed sections then it goes into this story about Roger Young and it's got a song that's got a song with musical notes that you can sing I'm gonna read you the the lyrics in first part of it like yeah there's snipers around here you've got to move it you know like Roger that but that that wraps up this this particular volume volume seven and you know that last little section it's these moments these little moments where we slack off where we get complacent just for a minute just for a minute and that's when we get crushed we can't let that happen we need to always stay on the path speaking of the path echo Charles is a day as one old record podcast speed it's good this book handle that some sections that I didn't cover because look I find leadership lessons everywhere but when we're talking about using cable foot bridge to cross rivers I found a little bit it was really a stretch oh I've got to sit there and tell everyone exactly what to do you're going to really lose then what you have to do is you have to utilize powerful and and and well executed decentralized command that's what control is back to the book one patrol had almost completed its mission when its presence and location were revealed to the enemy through an unguarded movement by one of the members this betrayal nullified the entire effort of that particular patrol patience is of the utmost importance in patrolling that's true the success or failure of a patrol depends in the final analysis upon the qualities of leadership possessed by the patrol leader in most cases the commanders have selected their best officers and NCOs to perform in his duty leadership is what makes a patrol successful leadership organizing professional patrols this is an interesting combat concept some commanders have gone so far as to organize permanent patrol groups whose principal function is to furnish personnel for battle missions the officer selected for these groups are volunteers the most aggressive tough and rugged officers in the unit they are permitted to select from the unit men who possess the same qualities after a period of intensive training in scouting patrol in battle drill and physical hardening the patrol group is attached to the unit headquarters from which it receives its mission so he's talking look they know the crossing points patrol should return from up this is comment patrol should return from a mission over a different route to avoid ambush alternate crossing points could have been determined by reconnaissance before the combat patrol was sent out it appears that the enemy allowed the patrol to cross the river unaposed and planned to ambush it by closing in behind so now lieutenant ex goes back so they get they get fought away from the place where they originally crossed he sets up a perimeter anticipation of attack by the enemy a sergeant was then sent out with the mission of crossing the river and reporting to the battalion commander for help the next section is called the rescue meanwhile the battalion commander received a situation report from the leader of the section which returned acting upon this information the battalion commander had formed a group of 20 men and had proceeded to the vicinity of this island and this is another thing that screwed up and when you see it on the terrain where this element wants to cross over they're going to cross the river but when you it's sort of like when you got that first edition like let's face it we kind of have a connection so check it out the book is called Final Spin you can pre-order it right now be the substragian tactics field man with a code evaluation protocol discipline it's freedom field manual way the warrior kid one two three and

executing Orlando completed completed next up is Phoenix August 17th and 18th then Las Vegas October 28th and 29th it's on it's on it's on can I declare COVID over oh they've got no use for praises loudly sung but in every soldier's heart in all the infantry shines the name shines the name of Roger Young Roger Young who fought and died for the men he marched among so this story is about a metal of honor recipient and it tells a bit of the story here that that song is about this metal of honor recipient Roger Young on July 31st 1943 the infantry company of which private young was a member was ordered to make a limited withdrawal from the battle line in order to adjust the battalion's position for the night at this time private young Splatoon was engaged with the enemy in dense jungle where observation was limited the Splatoon was suddenly pinned down by intense fire from a Japanese machine gun concealed on higher ground only 75 yards away the initial burst wounded private young as the Platoon started to obey the order to withdraw private young started creeping toward the emplacement despite a second wound he continued his heroic advance attracting enemy fire and answering with rifle fire I'm close to his objective he began throwing hand grenades and while doing so he was hit again and killed private young's bold action in closing with this Japanese pill box and thus diverting its fire permitted his platoon to disengage itself without loss and was responsible for several enemy casualties like I said Roger Young was he received the metal of honor for this action and I looked up I looked up yeah a guard as opposed to like you could it's literally a guard is that like a rank like a position or someone like a guard guard tonight so now you're a century tonight like that you could you could use the word guard and century same word same I talked to Dean about getting some of those back online warrior kid podcast as well you can also join us in the underground at the underground on the underground jockel underground dot com it's an alternative podcast we've been talking about a bunch of wild things on there things that are not quite jockel podcast material but they're adjacent material amplifying material we've talked about a bunch of psychology we talk about group dynamics we do talk about leadership we talk about and we and we be doing Q and A on there as well so the reason we have that is because we don't know what's going to happen with all of these platforms that we're on and we did get we did get some is it called censorship we we get fully censored but we got some some warnings on one of the last podcast that we did about the Armenian genocide so who knows we we can't I know I do know you know who knows I know so what he's saying is like look we've been fighting this war for three and a half four years and even right now we have to explain what to do how to maintain security because we're taking unnecessary casualties because people aren't falling the proper protocols the inevitable results of of security carelessness are pointy illustrated by three following incidents carelessness cost lives cost lives reported by technician fifth grade earnest j-langie 130 fifth infantry we stayed in one CP for two weeks without drawing a shell and it felt quite secure for we had been told that the enemy hadn't been shelling in that particular vicinity for the past thirty days however a few of the men either forgot or disregarded their instructions they watched some white towels and shirts and hung them out the dry and effective signal for the enemy artillery fire upon our command post three of our men were killed in the shelling that followed this breaches security learning security the hard way reported by an infantry battalion commander after being sheld out of two CP locations the first time with severe casualties we reorganized a sadly depleted CP group and opened for business in another building a third story battalion OP and the same building could be reached only by passing a large open window on a stair landing since the entire village was under enemy observation and direct fire it was necessary to crawl past this open window to ensure that this would be done a century was stationed in the stairway so there's a window you have to crawl when you go by this window and I like jump are you gonna tease me is that the culture you know kind of like like why are you jumping for you know kind of thing you're asking if I'm gonna tease you but it doesn't it kind of like under values really what it is telling you so some people listen to music when they work out listen listen to podcasts good all good moves but if you if you on those days let's face it they do come from time to time we're sitting there really don't feel like doing this putting this put in the psychological warfare you'll be in you'll be in the game 100% results on that one by the way I just had to go statistical on your own it's statistical 100% footicide canvas dot com my brother Dakota Meyer making freaking awesome stuff to hang on your wall that will also keep you on the path I written a bunch of books final spin I don't know if I'm going to win this argument with my publisher so this is a bad scenario cross fire three members of the patrol were wounded it was estimated that about fifty enemy fighters were in the grove first lieutenant ex assumed command and because they had a fire order the patrol to return to the former beach at position c to the wounded man had been it had to be assisted after their arrival so now they go back to this perimeter that they had after their arrival at c the firing stopped and the temporary perimeter was organized so they they get back the regroup they got two wounded lieutenant ex finding them into closely grouped ordered two sections to move forward further inland neither section moved as far as lieutenant ex intended so he signaled them to move further so their inner perimeter lieutenant ex says hey push out from the perimeter a little bit they don't really move far enough so he gives him a signal to move further this signal was interpreted to mean that the sections were to return to the river via separate routes as had been discussed earlier when the patrol first reorganized it see because both sections moved out leaving lieutenant ex by himself with his twenty men so now we have completely we have three different sections out here three different elements out there I just I just said a podcast with him and he said that I speak like Russian language like so however the Russian language is which you can kind of guess when you hear a Russian person speak English you know send location like that kind of thing he says that I speak English as if I'm a Russian human so that book is definitely written in a very let's say lean lean methodology
