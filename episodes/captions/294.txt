00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.40 This is Jockelpontcast number 294 with echo Charles and me,
00:00:04.40 --> 00:00:06.80 Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.20 --> 00:00:16.56 Flight, this is Blue Star 6, RP, major bunting analysis across the release point on the ground indicating
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:21.12 two minutes flight time to the landing zone. Without announcement, Charlie gunships from
00:00:21.12 --> 00:00:27.04 Crossbows began a slow dive toward the landing zone prepared to release some of the 14,
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:34.000 2.75 inch rockets that each aircraft carried along with their machine guns if it became necessary.
00:00:35.68 --> 00:00:41.84 Flight, lead is taking fire. Blue Star 6 announced over the UHF frequency, which was obvious
00:00:41.84 --> 00:00:47.28 to everyone behind him as the green tracers were coming from all around him.
00:00:47.28 --> 00:00:53.28 Choc2 is taking fire, we're hit, came the next announcement. Suddenly the radio was alive with every
00:00:53.28 --> 00:00:59.28 aircraft reporting taking fire as they crossed the RP and the woods around the landing zone
00:00:59.28 --> 00:01:03.12 were highlighted by red and white flashes and green tracers streaming upward.
00:01:04.88 --> 00:01:09.52 As each aircraft flew into the cone of fire attempting to reach the landing zone and discharge
00:01:09.52 --> 00:01:14.56 their load, the air waves became garbled as pilots stepped on each other's transmission
00:01:14.56 --> 00:01:21.28 or in panic, depress their transmit switch to the entire flight. So they could everyone could hear
00:01:21.28 --> 00:01:26.24 the conversation between a pilot and his crew. Choc6 is taking shit, get on your guns,
00:01:26.24 --> 00:01:33.04 Choc5, where's the damn guns? Break, break, choc10 is. There was so much confusion that no one could
00:01:33.04 --> 00:01:40.24 get a complete sentence transmitted until. Mayday, mayday, Dutch master 4-1 is going down.
00:01:41.20 --> 00:01:47.36 Said captain Fox and almost a calm voice. Who the hell is Dutch master 4-1? Someone asked
00:01:47.36 --> 00:01:53.60 over the radio, looking skyward and searching, everyone had their answer. Dutch master 4-1 was
00:01:53.60 --> 00:02:00.000 the command and control aircraft for the cab screen and was entering an auto rotation from 4,000 feet.
00:02:01.60 --> 00:02:06.08 What really held everyone's attention was the flames coming out of the bottom of the aircraft.
00:02:06.08 --> 00:02:13.04 Oh shit, it was obvious that he'd taken a hit with an explosive round in the fuel cell, but at 4,000 feet,
00:02:13.04 --> 00:02:20.56 every aircraft had at least one set of eyes tracking this crippled aircraft. An aircraft
00:02:20.56 --> 00:02:28.24 in flight on fire was somehow something few had ever seen before and it was horrifying and mesmerizing.
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:36.40 Mayday, Dutch master 4-1 is on fire. Was the next call from captain Fox, his voice a bit elevated.
00:02:36.40 --> 00:02:42.64 Fire was every aviators' worst nightmare. Shoot me, but don't let me burn.
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:49.44 It was a fear that had been with aviators since Orville and Wilbur had first flown.
00:02:51.36 --> 00:02:56.96 Before parachutes, World War I pilots were known to use their pistols rather than burn in an aircraft.
00:02:58.64 --> 00:03:05.52 As everyone watched, the radio is went silent. Slowly, Dutch master 4-1 began a slow roll.
00:03:05.52 --> 00:03:13.36 And as it hit the trees, it was inverted. The cab screen began to converge on the crash site.
00:03:14.40 --> 00:03:20.32 As major bunting entered the coltron of enemy fire, he turned to Mr. Grossman.
00:03:20.32 --> 00:03:26.32 Get on the controls with me in case I'm hit. Grossman immediately did so that with a very light touch,
00:03:26.32 --> 00:03:31.60 ready to take command of the aircraft. Suddenly, sour and Thomas opened fire.
00:03:31.60 --> 00:03:37.36 Taking fire, they both screamed together. Though there was no need since the sound of a hammer tapping
00:03:37.36 --> 00:03:43.60 on the side of the aircraft could clearly be heard. As blue star 6 continued to press toward the landing zone,
00:03:43.60 --> 00:03:45.92 decelerating and coming to a hover.
00:03:47.76 --> 00:03:52.48 The Arvins soldiers didn't wait for the aircraft to land. They started jumping out as the aircraft
00:03:52.48 --> 00:03:57.60 came to a slow walk. Before a major bunting could land, the aircraft was empty.
00:03:57.60 --> 00:04:03.36 Sir, go, go, where empty, sour yelled as he continued to fire as weapon at the tree line.
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:11.76 Talk one on the go, major bunting transmitted, LZ is hot. His next transmission followed almost immediately.
00:04:12.56 --> 00:04:18.000 Made a made a, blue star 6 is going in. He had just cleared the landing zone
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:32.24 when the aircraft engine quit. And that right there is an excerpt from book three from a series
00:04:32.24 --> 00:04:38.88 of books called Undontered Valor, which were written by Colonel Matt Jackson. And this is the third
00:04:38.88 --> 00:04:48.56 book of the series, which is subtitled Lamson 719. And the first book that he wrote in this series
00:04:48.56 --> 00:04:54.72 was subtitled and a salt helicopter squadron of Vietnam 1969 to 1970. And we had the honor of
00:04:54.72 --> 00:05:02.32 covering that book with Colonel Jackson on this podcast. It was podcast number 275. And that first
00:05:02.32 --> 00:05:12.32 book is based on Colonel Jackson's experiences himself as in Vietnam as a Huey pilot. The Huey,
00:05:12.32 --> 00:05:23.12 the iconic helicopter of the Vietnam War. And that first book, it's written as a novel or a story
00:05:23.12 --> 00:05:28.80 with the main character. The main character is named Dan Corrie, but that character is based on Colonel
00:05:28.80 --> 00:05:34.96 Jackson and the events that are in the book took place. And this third book is written in a similar
00:05:34.96 --> 00:05:43.84 way. It's written from the perspective or focused on an individual named Dan Corrie. But the
00:05:43.84 --> 00:05:51.60 events that are written about in this third book, they took place. And it continues to recount some
00:05:51.60 --> 00:05:59.20 of these incredible heroics from these helicopter pilots and helicopter crews in Vietnam. And this
00:05:59.20 --> 00:06:07.60 third book in the series tells the story of a massive operation, which included the largest
00:06:07.60 --> 00:06:12.96 helicopter assault of the Vietnam War. This is an operation that lasted 45 days. He was conducted
00:06:12.96 --> 00:06:19.84 in Louss. And it was an attempt to shut down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. And this book, Undonged
00:06:19.84 --> 00:06:29.12 Valor, Lamson, 719, is filled with incredible details that Colonel Jackson got by interviewing
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:36.08 and doing intense research to accurately describe what happened. And the books, incredible read,
00:06:37.84 --> 00:06:42.56 but we're actually not going to read the book much today. We're going to touch on it a little bit
00:06:42.56 --> 00:06:52.16 because we have the honor of having one of the pilots who also flew Huey's in Vietnam and who flew
00:06:53.04 --> 00:07:03.60 missions in support of Operation Lamson 719. His name is J. T. He's a retired major, US Army.
00:07:04.64 --> 00:07:10.80 He is the recipient of two distinguished flying crosses, 38 air metals, recognizing
00:07:10.80 --> 00:07:20.88 950 hours of combat flying, the Bronze Star, the Vietnamese Cross of Galantry, and the Silver Star
00:07:20.88 --> 00:07:27.36 for his heroic actions under fire. He's an honor to have him here with us tonight.
00:07:28.24 --> 00:07:35.04 J. Thank you for joining us. Well, well that introduction was put me right back on the cockpit.
00:07:35.04 --> 00:07:44.88 And that book is filled with those either coming into landing zones or coming out of landing zones.
00:07:44.88 --> 00:07:50.64 It's just incredible to read and incredible to learn about the history of that operation.
00:07:51.20 --> 00:07:56.88 As a matter of fact, I was talking to a friend of mine that was in that was in in Sagan, Vietnam.
00:07:56.88 --> 00:08:03.04 And I mentioned that you were coming on the podcast and I told him that you flew in Lamson 719.
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:10.64 And the look on his faces, that was a rough one. You know, we supported
00:08:10.64 --> 00:08:16.32 Commander-Cotrone North, which was the northern segment of SOG and Vietnam.
00:08:17.12 --> 00:08:26.08 And I remember several missions that we flew prior to the kickoff of Lamson 719 on
00:08:26.08 --> 00:08:33.52 the 8 February prior to that. We were flying out of the Quantry Dong Ha area with a group of
00:08:33.52 --> 00:08:42.88 Commander-Cotrone North Gossum up there flying west towards K-Son when all of a sudden
00:08:42.88 --> 00:08:51.04 on our flood of four, we saw these orange fireballs coming up at us. And we immediately took
00:08:51.04 --> 00:09:01.28 a invasive action 23 millimeter an aircraft fire coming up at us. We took action to get out of there.
00:09:01.28 --> 00:09:06.88 Obviously, the mission at that moment was called off and we made it back to Dong Ha.
00:09:07.68 --> 00:09:12.32 One of the guys over torqued his aircraft in the invasive action.
00:09:13.36 --> 00:09:20.08 And it had to be grounded for inspection and for tail rotor to make sure that nothing had happened
00:09:20.08 --> 00:09:28.000 that would cause him further damage or even crashing. But that was in January of 71 before
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.40 the kickoff of 8 February 71.
00:09:32.72 --> 00:09:38.72 Well, before we get into that, let's talk a little bit about the beginning of J. T.
00:09:38.72 --> 00:09:40.56 Where did you grow up? Where did you come from?
00:09:41.28 --> 00:09:47.12 A group in a little town called Hickory North Carolina. I was born in Pensacola. My father was
00:09:47.12 --> 00:09:54.64 flying chief in the Navy, flew PBYs. He was in charge of a hangar at Pensacola that repaired
00:09:54.64 --> 00:10:01.68 the scan on PBYs that were shot up. And Dad would take him up and fly up. Because the idiot
00:10:01.68 --> 00:10:07.44 circle around the airfield and land it and check to make sure the rivets were holding a
00:10:07.44 --> 00:10:12.64 K on the aircraft. So he was an enlisted chief in the Navy? Yep. That's pretty good.
00:10:12.64 --> 00:10:20.000 He had a background in aviation, or not in aviation metal smith, but it was a metal smith himself
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.16 and did a lot of work with sheep metal and stuff like that. So obviously it was a skill that the
00:10:26.16 --> 00:10:34.40 Navy needed and Dad was a real smart guy and picked up on it and loved flying and got his wings.
00:10:34.40 --> 00:10:40.80 I remember his wings were had a goal center with the silver wings, which was different than the
00:10:40.80 --> 00:10:47.44 Air-regler, aviation, or as all several wings of the Navy. Or goal wings of the Navy. Yeah. So he was
00:10:47.44 --> 00:10:53.60 kind of a disappointed at and going the Navy, but when I went into Army aviation, that's sort of
00:10:53.60 --> 00:10:58.88 smoothed it over for him. How long did he do in the Navy? He was just a guy that went in in
00:10:58.88 --> 00:11:07.36 in 1942 after Pearl Harbor and got out in 45 and served the rest of his time in the reserves.
00:11:07.36 --> 00:11:13.04 Got out of the reserves right after the Korean War. Was he his own business man? He was going to
00:11:13.04 --> 00:11:19.12 say what was he for a living? Yeah, he was a full-time firefighter for the city of Hickory North
00:11:19.12 --> 00:11:23.52 Carolina and he also owned his own business. He had a shell service station. It was called
00:11:23.52 --> 00:11:32.40 Tate-Shale Service Station and I remember he had Tate-Shale and it was in great big letters,
00:11:32.40 --> 00:11:39.68 limited letters on top of the service station and the S letter burned out and had Tate-Hale
00:11:39.68 --> 00:11:47.20 up there. So dad would do a few commercials and on the radio and he said,
00:11:47.20 --> 00:11:56.40 business has been really good. We have sold the S out of Hell. It's so what about mom?
00:11:56.40 --> 00:12:05.12 See what was he doing? Mom was a typical housewife. Brought me up the stay at home.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.40 A group in her neighborhood where nobody locked her doors. We could go with vacation for two weeks.
00:12:10.40 --> 00:12:19.76 Doors to stay open. Remember one time we had a fire in our home burned up all it was in the
00:12:19.76 --> 00:12:26.24 clause that burned up all the others closed and they had no way of getting in touch with us because
00:12:26.24 --> 00:12:30.96 we didn't have sales service back then. But I remember all the ladies on a neighborhood came down
00:12:30.96 --> 00:12:35.84 and had the house completely cleaned up when we arrived home except for the fact that mother's
00:12:35.84 --> 00:12:40.000 closed were all burned up. But she got the insurance and got to buy home your wardrobe.
00:12:41.20 --> 00:12:44.40 That's not a bad deal. That's a kind of neighborhood. That grew up and nice.
00:12:44.40 --> 00:12:48.24 What about you? What were you interested in? What were you doing when you were a kid?
00:12:48.24 --> 00:12:59.36 Okay. It's quite ironic. In our neighborhood we had a field that was vacant and we called it
00:12:59.36 --> 00:13:06.96 the battlefield. And you have to understand this was in the early 50s and all of our parents had
00:13:06.96 --> 00:13:13.68 served in some form of military service. We had some Marines. We had Navy. We had Army.
00:13:13.68 --> 00:13:21.68 Then we had a Air Force. But we did have Navy pilot that was there. So we would all put on the
00:13:21.68 --> 00:13:30.48 gear that our fathers brought home and would play Army up in our battlefield. And from we would
00:13:30.48 --> 00:13:36.80 dig foxholes and we would make our own hand grenades but we couldn't pronounce hand grenades
00:13:36.80 --> 00:13:45.52 so we called him hand grenades. And the hand grenade was we would dig up red clay and North
00:13:45.52 --> 00:13:51.60 Kiela's watch it and would put water on it and fasten the balls and let it sit out in the sun.
00:13:52.16 --> 00:13:58.56 And then we would throw those at the enemy. In our marijuana time Eric Schufra got a black eye
00:13:58.56 --> 00:14:03.36 and his mother was not real happy that we were playing battlefield and throwing hand grenades.
00:14:03.36 --> 00:14:11.36 And then what about as you got older? As I got older I really wanted to go to a military school.
00:14:12.32 --> 00:14:18.24 And my parents were not quite, I was an older kid so my parents were not quite ready to
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:25.92 let me go. I got into the scouts, got to wear the uniform. Say that was very important to me
00:14:25.92 --> 00:14:33.76 then wearing the uniform wearing it correctly. In high school I got into the band. I was a drummer.
00:14:34.56 --> 00:14:42.24 But the uniforms were all shaped like the tailored after the West Point uniforms with the
00:14:42.24 --> 00:14:52.64 high collars and to me that was just added to the the desired who want to do something in uniform.
00:14:52.64 --> 00:14:56.48 Then want to be a firefighter my father was but then cared to be a firefighter my uncle
00:14:57.20 --> 00:15:02.24 was a police officer didn't care about being a police officer. But there was something about the military
00:15:02.24 --> 00:15:09.36 that that was like a magnet to me. I would watch every as a child, I would watch every movie,
00:15:10.56 --> 00:15:17.20 a military movie on TV that would come on. Randolph Scott you know played those being he man
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:25.28 Marine you know kind of like you know except you were in the Navy. But those things I gravitated
00:15:25.28 --> 00:15:32.24 toward that my good friend Don Murphy who I grew up with he did the same thing he went to the Marine
00:15:32.24 --> 00:15:40.56 Corps and it was really he went to the NCO route obviously officer out so at the times when we
00:15:40.56 --> 00:15:45.44 would be on leave and come home at the same time I had to go through this whole rigourment of
00:15:45.44 --> 00:15:50.08 about being an officer and and then listen man really knew what was going on and we were just there
00:15:50.08 --> 00:15:58.16 for showmanship. So what year did you graduate from high school? I graduated in 63
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.48 quite interestingly I had tried out for the United States of America high school band
00:16:07.36 --> 00:16:15.28 as a drummer and was offered a trip so we this is these are two to four students from every state
00:16:15.28 --> 00:16:21.92 in the Indian and we met at University of Southern Mississippi to practice and then we toured
00:16:21.92 --> 00:16:29.28 all down through the south across over in the Mexico doing concert tours all the way to Hollywood
00:16:29.28 --> 00:16:36.08 we did a we did a big concert in the Hollywood Bowl and I mean have a bit of a saying you know
00:16:36.08 --> 00:16:41.84 and again in those outstanding uniforms that were similar to the ones that I wore at
00:16:41.84 --> 00:16:49.36 Banyon uniforms at a war in high school and so it just added to the and I was proud of that
00:16:49.36 --> 00:16:54.80 I was very proud to wear that uniform and I wore it right and I spit shined my shoes I did that
00:16:54.80 --> 00:16:58.56 all away from junior high school and I was in the band all away through high school so I
00:16:58.56 --> 00:17:06.80 knew how to spit shined but then I was offered a full scholarship to University of Southern Mississippi
00:17:06.80 --> 00:17:14.08 and also to University of West Virginia I didn't like West Virginia because it's everything was
00:17:14.08 --> 00:17:19.12 heels it seemed like everywhere you went you had to go up a hill and I know you navy guys you
00:17:19.12 --> 00:17:24.88 liked that stuff but you know I was quite into that so I took the scholarship to Southern Mississippi
00:17:25.76 --> 00:17:32.88 there ROTC was mandatory for freshmen and sophomores and so there again here I was in uniform
00:17:32.88 --> 00:17:38.16 not only and I was at the scholarship I was in University of Southern Mississippi was a full full
00:17:38.16 --> 00:17:43.12 rod music scholarship and I was a drummer in the University of Southern Mississippi band
00:17:45.20 --> 00:17:51.60 after my first year I decided I didn't want to be a music major so I thought well you know
00:17:51.60 --> 00:17:58.72 I think I'll go into art design because I like to be creative in this so I transferred out of Southern
00:17:58.72 --> 00:18:05.44 Mississippi to my father's just made because it was all paid for and I enrolled in East Tennessee State
00:18:05.44 --> 00:18:14.80 University in Johnson City Tennessee and there again sophomore year I was in my sophomore year
00:18:14.80 --> 00:18:20.40 ROTC mandatory but the more I got into it the the more I just really gravitated towards that
00:18:20.40 --> 00:18:32.08 and I took my oath of office as an advanced core cadet as a junior and from there on it's just
00:18:32.88 --> 00:18:38.96 I cared more about getting that commission than I did about getting my degree I had transferred majors
00:18:40.40 --> 00:18:46.80 from music to art design so and that time we were all in the quarter system so I had to go
00:18:46.80 --> 00:18:52.88 in extra quarter to take up all the courses that I needed to take and I graduated December
00:18:52.88 --> 00:19:01.36 at 67 first went down the island capping gown and then after I got my diploma then all of the
00:19:01.36 --> 00:19:08.16 cadets go out take off the capping gown and we put on our uniform coats where I had the pants and
00:19:08.72 --> 00:19:14.000 stuff on for that so under the gowns so I came down and we were all commissioned in an
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.16 I remember my mom and dad pinnacles gold bars on my shoulder and boy I tell you what I
00:19:18.16 --> 00:19:24.88 yeah I felt like I had really accomplished at least the first phase of my life so that was
00:19:24.88 --> 00:19:35.60 1967. Night December of 67 I went on active duty in March of 68 as an infantry officer
00:19:35.60 --> 00:19:43.60 brand new what we call butter bar wearing the gold bars the second lieutenant I went to
00:19:43.60 --> 00:19:50.64 the infantry schools called the infantry officers basic course at Fort Benning just on the other
00:19:50.64 --> 00:19:57.12 side of the hill for most for all the OCS guys they called OCS the Benning School for Boys
00:19:58.64 --> 00:20:03.84 and I'll never forget we were so here we were commissioned officers and there they were
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:11.20 hoping to be commissioned officers and many times we would march by their their area and I
00:20:11.20 --> 00:20:17.20 recall a big telephone pole and on top of the telephone pole in the officer candidate school
00:20:17.20 --> 00:20:26.88 area was this black helmet shiny black helmet with a gold bar in the center of the helmet
00:20:26.88 --> 00:20:35.92 it was actually a helmet liner and what they would try to OCS guys the house competition who could
00:20:35.92 --> 00:20:41.84 get up there and get the helmet first course the pole was always greased and I don't know if anybody
00:20:41.84 --> 00:20:49.20 ever got up there got that helmet without putting cleats on their shoes but at any rate but yeah that's
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.20 that was my first taste at Benning of being a real army officer. So this is 1967 so you must have
00:20:57.20 --> 00:21:01.84 pretty much known as an infantry officer you were gonna end up going to Vietnam. Oh yeah I was
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:10.88 I was ready I was prepared I was mentally prepared while at East Tennessee State I was
00:21:10.88 --> 00:21:16.80 a member of the Sigma Phi Upsilon fraternity practically every one of the advanced
00:21:16.80 --> 00:21:25.28 corkidats juniors and seniors were advanced corps army ROTC cadets and everyone this
00:21:25.28 --> 00:21:32.56 my fraternity was a big military fraternity and we we took great pride in that and
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:37.52 I remember we would inspect each other and the fraternity asked before we would leave to go to
00:21:37.52 --> 00:21:42.48 drill on Thursdays just to make sure everybody was dressed right dressed ready for it and
00:21:43.52 --> 00:21:51.60 and it was it was an it was an honor to be an advanced corkidat and you had all of these
00:21:51.60 --> 00:21:57.92 underclassmen that this was that you were leading this was our first time is really being a leader
00:21:57.92 --> 00:22:06.80 giving commands moving orders for a platoon and company drill and and and this kind of stuff and so
00:22:07.84 --> 00:22:15.52 they were instilling on us they being the cadre was instilling us the correct way of
00:22:15.52 --> 00:22:24.56 of of being an officer of showing authority without disrespecting people and you can correct
00:22:24.56 --> 00:22:33.28 people without disrespecting people and and I learned that through ROTC and that's kind of
00:22:33.28 --> 00:22:38.48 kind of interesting because I know that ROTC cadets coming up being commissioned
00:22:39.28 --> 00:22:43.60 then have the greatest reputation amongst a lot of the NCOs in the army at that time
00:22:43.60 --> 00:22:52.16 so when it's 1967 and you mentioned that everyone freshman and sophomore had to be in ROTC
00:22:52.16 --> 00:22:57.76 it was mandatory at at University of Southern Mississippi and it was mandatory at East Tennessee State
00:22:57.76 --> 00:23:03.12 University I can't speak for the other colleges and universities but I would think that
00:23:03.92 --> 00:23:10.80 perhaps that was the manner in which every university at least of us federally funded university
00:23:10.80 --> 00:23:18.72 had to operate wow that's pretty so what about what about like as far as kind of the social
00:23:19.68 --> 00:23:25.44 aspects of America at the time where you started in 1967 you were you really seeing much of that
00:23:25.44 --> 00:23:33.84 anti-war attitude or anything like that no not we were not subjected to that I don't recall that
00:23:33.84 --> 00:23:43.36 I recall that on campus there was no snickering when in uniform every Thursday was drill day
00:23:43.92 --> 00:23:47.68 and so everyone had to show up for drill day had to be in proper uniform
00:23:51.20 --> 00:23:57.36 if you were a sophomore or a freshman or sophomore you were carrying the M1 Grand Raffle
00:23:57.92 --> 00:24:02.80 and every week as a freshman sophomore you had to go to the arms room and clean your weapon
00:24:02.80 --> 00:24:09.36 and I had to be and you see you were taking ROTC for credit so for the two years of
00:24:09.36 --> 00:24:14.56 Jefferson sophomore you were taking ROTC for credit so yeah you best clean your weapon because
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:19.92 if you did and you get a demerit and X number of demerits means you got a dropping grade so
00:24:20.88 --> 00:24:24.16 we would actually go through and do inspection before
00:24:24.16 --> 00:24:32.000 every drill mate which was on Thursdays and that's how I learned how to inspect an M1 Go-Anne
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Rife and I don't know if you ever fired one of those but I think I actually have fired one
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.52 I think I actually have I fired a bunch of different weapons you know we do like these familiarization
00:24:45.52 --> 00:24:50.88 shoots and they brought a lot of bunch of old weapons and new weapons and I can't but I'm pretty sure
00:24:50.88 --> 00:24:58.48 I have fired one but they used to have this when you would clean your raffle when you pull the bolt back
00:24:59.84 --> 00:25:04.72 and you would have to clean down through the board and everything and then what you would do is you would
00:25:04.72 --> 00:25:11.76 take the little quite cloth that you used to stick on the on the board rod to clean the
00:25:12.32 --> 00:25:16.16 clean the board out but you'd stick it down there and you'd look through and the light from
00:25:16.16 --> 00:25:20.96 that would shine up through and you could tell whether or not you had any any materials in the board
00:25:20.96 --> 00:25:32.96 it shouldn't be there and but then you had to you had to pull back on the charging in yes
00:25:33.52 --> 00:25:38.56 and then let it go right quick so it would go forward what if you didn't let it go right quick
00:25:38.56 --> 00:25:47.36 you would get what's called ill one thumb because it would get stuck right and many times I had him one thumb on that yeah
00:25:49.52 --> 00:25:54.08 so so you go to the infantry course the wood you call the basic infantry course
00:25:54.08 --> 00:26:01.04 after off-sourced basic course I OBC so when when you're in that I mean you must be these guys are
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:08.32 preparing you to go be a platoon leader and be around correct correct yeah 1542 platoon leader and
00:26:08.32 --> 00:26:14.72 and this is now is it 1968 1968 now so there's a lot of experience guys that are teaching you a lot
00:26:15.60 --> 00:26:23.92 a lot how long was that course of instruction non weeks if I think correctly was it non weeks or 16 weeks
00:26:23.92 --> 00:26:34.80 I think it was might have been 12 weeks I'd have to think about that because I took my first command
00:26:34.80 --> 00:26:46.32 at brag I was there in in March not took my first command at brag and in round August so when you're
00:26:46.32 --> 00:26:49.92 going through that course or you get forming up platoons and you're going out and doing training
00:26:49.92 --> 00:26:55.44 this is that kind of thing yeah that's exactly right forming in platoon and companies and then they
00:26:55.44 --> 00:27:00.64 rotated who was going to put the platoon leader maybe we're all second-lead tenants well not all of us
00:27:01.28 --> 00:27:06.80 we had some direct commission guys in there I had a sergeant major who was direct commission to a captain
00:27:06.80 --> 00:27:16.56 and special forces guy and snake eater and he he was always the company commander
00:27:16.56 --> 00:27:24.80 and great guy wonderful guy but we was switch rolls around we participated in all different
00:27:24.80 --> 00:27:35.68 consummenevers whether it be an armored column with infantry or whether it be squad tactics
00:27:35.68 --> 00:27:43.36 whether it be platoon tactics or where that was in a company crossing over what then they called the
00:27:43.36 --> 00:27:52.88 line of departure the L.D. we don't have that in warfare and every there is no L.D. it's a
00:27:52.88 --> 00:27:58.56 blocked perimeter defense and we're going to that but we practiced all of that not everybody went
00:27:58.56 --> 00:28:06.56 airborne but we all did the the almost a 47 foot tower that dropped you out and so you get a
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:14.80 feel for what falling with a shoot on his like and but we were on a night combat compass course
00:28:15.68 --> 00:28:23.76 in an ever four office we were not teams of four pouring down rain in four menning Georgia
00:28:24.64 --> 00:28:35.36 Columbia Columbus George and it was in the early spring and it was cold as hell and we were sitting
00:28:35.36 --> 00:28:42.32 or chattering and it was a night combat compass course we were dropped off at a point on a road
00:28:42.32 --> 00:28:50.48 in a doos on a half and all right team alpha out so we would get out and we knew where we were
00:28:50.48 --> 00:28:57.20 had a postmark with a number on it and we had our maps so we knew where we were and then we had
00:28:57.20 --> 00:29:03.60 our directions okay you're you're you're a 4A you got to be a point bay and you had to shoot your
00:29:03.60 --> 00:29:09.92 asthma looking at your maps see what shoot your asthma with that and then go to point bay and then
00:29:09.92 --> 00:29:17.76 you go to point bay to point c but pouring down rain cold tea chattering only one guy in our four
00:29:17.76 --> 00:29:26.16 smoke so we would have him light a cigarette and put it in his mouth and he would go out following
00:29:26.16 --> 00:29:32.96 the asthma and till we were telling the stop and light it so that we could make correct okay go
00:29:32.96 --> 00:29:38.16 two feet to your right two feet to your left so that he was directly on asthma and then he would stand
00:29:38.16 --> 00:29:43.04 there with his cigarette lit so we can puffing on it so we could see the light and then we would go to
00:29:43.04 --> 00:29:50.72 him then we'd shoot the next asthma with the exact same way send him out and guess what we made it
00:29:50.72 --> 00:29:56.08 we made it we were one of the first teams to make it through that night combat compass course
00:29:56.08 --> 00:30:05.44 of course along the way there were little surprises like an explosion would happen over maybe
00:30:05.44 --> 00:30:11.68 20 meters to our right so we'd have to go down well it was all planned as to where this stuff was
00:30:11.68 --> 00:30:17.44 going and we didn't realize it but in our there were season troops out there taking care of us they
00:30:17.44 --> 00:30:26.48 weren't going to let us get hurt we didn't know that at the time but but during that night compass
00:30:26.48 --> 00:30:35.36 course pouring down rain I heard in the background what what what what what what what what
00:30:35.36 --> 00:30:39.36 it got louder and louder and louder and louder and louder and it finally what what what
00:30:39.36 --> 00:30:47.60 about the straight over our heads to Huey aircraft and I said to myself those guys are dry
00:30:49.44 --> 00:30:55.36 they have it better than I do a couple days later in our company area they had a
00:30:56.08 --> 00:31:00.88 sauna anyone interested in army aviation we're going to be given the flight after two
00:31:00.88 --> 00:31:05.44 tests on a certain date I was the first in order to run the sauna for that thing
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:12.24 and then that was it you got picked up for it graduated from a bending took my first command
00:31:12.24 --> 00:31:18.24 at Fort Bragg I was in interesting here I am an infantry officer and my command was a military
00:31:18.24 --> 00:31:22.88 and was with a military intelligence battalion M. Avita in here I am an infantry officer
00:31:23.44 --> 00:31:29.52 I'll never forget my first sergeant first sergeant Chuck Holly I don't think anybody ever
00:31:29.52 --> 00:31:35.60 forgets the name of their first first sergeant not officers and he brought me in he treated me
00:31:36.72 --> 00:31:40.56 I was kind of embarrassed because he had all these metals and here I am brand new
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:48.64 second lieutenant no combat experience and he treated me like with great respect and
00:31:50.80 --> 00:31:55.20 welcome me aboard I mean I never forget the first time I walked in that early room he calls
00:31:55.20 --> 00:31:59.92 you all your room to attention I'll sort of baffled you know here I have secondly tenets you looking
00:31:59.92 --> 00:32:07.36 over your shoulder for a criminal yeah what in the world is going but yeah and I learned a lot from
00:32:07.36 --> 00:32:16.08 I started Holly my first first sergeant never forget going out on just a maneuver and here I am
00:32:17.12 --> 00:32:24.16 we have our military intelligence and my bars military intelligence battalion air reconnaissance
00:32:24.16 --> 00:32:30.16 my actual unit and I was command of Alfa the test but we had our law of mission we would take
00:32:30.16 --> 00:32:36.24 photographs that were uh talking about the air force sent back to Fort Bragg for a photographs
00:32:36.24 --> 00:32:42.16 over Vietnam sent back to Fort Bragg and my guys and Alfa the testman and there was
00:32:42.16 --> 00:32:46.40 bravada testman Charlie the testman but the missions given our guys we were actually
00:32:47.60 --> 00:32:53.52 taking uh the photographs and pulling intelligence out of the photographs using
00:32:53.52 --> 00:32:58.48 stereoscopes which you can measure the height of various objects from so on so forth
00:32:58.48 --> 00:33:07.36 then we would put all that together and we would get in a bird dog at Fort Bragg and
00:33:07.36 --> 00:33:14.56 fly that to DC and that and it was a real live mission I mean how many people can say that
00:33:14.56 --> 00:33:20.32 you know they were we were actually doing a real live mission in support of Vietnam at that time
00:33:20.32 --> 00:33:26.64 here I was a little secondly tenant you know barely drive behind the ears and my first sergeant
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:30.80 kept me straight how did a bunch of warm officers worked for me too and they really did all the work
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:37.12 I was there just to sign my name and and thank my first sergeant for keeping me straight
00:33:37.76 --> 00:33:41.84 how long did you do that job for? Four months, the orders came down sending me to
00:33:42.56 --> 00:33:48.32 flight school at Fort Walter's Texas so you showed the flight school when we were talking
00:33:48.32 --> 00:33:54.24 when I was talking to Colonel Jackson it sounded crazy the number of helicopter pilots that
00:33:54.24 --> 00:34:01.36 would be in train at that time it was amazing totally amazing you see Matt Jackson started off as
00:34:01.36 --> 00:34:09.60 warm officer so he had a whole different experience than I did that was for warm officer
00:34:09.60 --> 00:34:15.04 Candace school we called them walks and people said well what's a walk and we'd say well
00:34:15.04 --> 00:34:21.76 that's something you throw out a web it I think it's funny because it would he's talking
00:34:21.76 --> 00:34:27.12 about you guys the commission officers they called them RLO's real life officers
00:34:28.72 --> 00:34:34.16 so we had the real life officers and the walks yeah the real live officers
00:34:34.72 --> 00:34:42.40 yeah and and we were all each class had a designated color and the my class at the
00:34:42.40 --> 00:34:47.68 be the yellow hat class and you tell different classes about the color of baseball cap that you wore
00:34:48.08 --> 00:34:55.36 and you had these funny wings that you sewed on the on the front of your hat they weren't
00:34:55.36 --> 00:35:03.28 aviator wings but like student aviator wings and so we had the yellow hat so the walk class going
00:35:03.28 --> 00:35:10.72 through they were yellow hat class but we never never got together and that was the primary flight
00:35:10.72 --> 00:35:16.56 training and that's where we just learned to fly my first helicopter that I climbed into was a
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:25.28 training helicopter 55 it's a huge 300 aircraft but it was small I mean you could probably get the
00:35:25.28 --> 00:35:30.24 whole aircraft into this room would have to probably knock out part of your walls so the
00:35:30.24 --> 00:35:36.96 tail road would get through but that's how small it was I mean it was smaller than the OH13 and most
00:35:36.96 --> 00:35:45.36 people remember that by when they watched mash or the H23 which was back in that era as well
00:35:45.84 --> 00:35:51.36 but that's what I learned to fly on it was so tiny and being tiny wasn't easy to fly it was very
00:35:51.36 --> 00:35:58.32 squirrely so I remember people I said might I wish I was in that 13 or that 23 and they said
00:35:58.32 --> 00:36:04.16 well you know you're getting some great pilot skills in in that TH55 because you're learning how
00:36:04.16 --> 00:36:08.72 to adjust for a wind it's so and so forth and they said when you get to when you get to a
00:36:08.72 --> 00:36:14.96 rucker that Huey is going to be like you're climbing out a little fiat into a Rolls Royce
00:36:16.48 --> 00:36:24.000 and I remember our first cross country after we had solo I so load at my 14th hour you had to
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:32.80 solo within 16 hours or you got sent back to another class so I also load at my 14th hour and that's
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:39.36 amazing getting you know the instructor pilot gets on says okay you've got the aircraft and
00:36:40.48 --> 00:36:48.56 you fly the idiot circle and you call take off you call turning into the wind you call based
00:36:48.56 --> 00:36:52.80 and you call final you had to do all the correct call signs and everything and we were at little
00:36:52.80 --> 00:37:00.32 staging areas all around Fort Walters Texas which was in mineral wells Texas so we probably had
00:37:00.32 --> 00:37:05.76 staging areas as much as 50 miles out because you had all these classes and all these very staging
00:37:05.76 --> 00:37:14.32 areas and I'll never forget it was a little anxious when he climbed out of that cockpit and I knew
00:37:14.32 --> 00:37:24.64 that I was in control and but then after you flew your first solo coming back in the bus didn't
00:37:24.64 --> 00:37:34.08 stop it Fort Walters at the at the fort it stopped at the holiday end tradition is everyone
00:37:34.08 --> 00:37:40.40 who's so load the bus would stop there and those are how to solo get stayed on the bus those
00:37:40.40 --> 00:37:46.96 who had already solo got off the bus with the new solo guys and they carried you and threw you
00:37:46.96 --> 00:37:55.52 in the pool at the holiday end and interestingly at the holiday end in in in at mineral wells
00:37:55.52 --> 00:38:03.36 they had crossed Huey rotor blades that you walked under to go to the swimming pool and to have
00:38:03.36 --> 00:38:09.84 that honor of being thrown in the pool was just incredibly amazing and fulfilling.
00:38:11.20 --> 00:38:14.96 Did you have any did you have any trouble when you're going through aviation school
00:38:14.96 --> 00:38:19.84 did it come pretty naturally to you were you you know did did did you did you figured out pretty
00:38:19.84 --> 00:38:26.32 quicker when you said 14 hours was that well no I mean we have some guys that that solo
00:38:26.32 --> 00:38:32.08 at 10 hours I mean they were I mean just incredible but you have to understand a lot of the
00:38:32.08 --> 00:38:37.12 guys I went through with or I had their private ticket most of those fixed wing I don't know
00:38:37.12 --> 00:38:43.28 of anyone in my class that had a rotary wing private ticket and had they done that they could
00:38:43.28 --> 00:38:49.36 have probably sold load in five hours you know it just all depends but leaving there
00:38:50.96 --> 00:38:55.76 here's the other interesting thing all the polish we're getting this flight pay plus we're getting
00:38:55.76 --> 00:39:02.16 our normal cyclotinip pay which I think was like 247 dollars a month how much was flight pay
00:39:02.16 --> 00:39:07.76 oh flat pay was god i i i i i know when i quit getting flat pay it the end it was like 400
00:39:07.76 --> 00:39:12.64 something dollars a month but so that's kind of crazy right like you're almost doubling your pay oh yeah
00:39:12.64 --> 00:39:16.96 oh yeah and but but interesting about it is you got all these single guys here so what are we
00:39:16.96 --> 00:39:24.16 do we get to the to the car dealer so everybody I remember a good buddy of mine was my roommate
00:39:25.36 --> 00:39:32.88 he and i actually lived in a motel right up side the gate of Fort Walters and he had a
00:39:32.88 --> 00:39:45.20 Camero Z-28 whatever it was Z-carb V28 I had the Osmo Bill 442 and I mean that just goes on all the
00:39:45.20 --> 00:39:52.48 hot cars you know the single polish you know we thought our Sierra didn't stay we had that stuff you know
00:39:52.48 --> 00:40:02.40 we you know we were just there there was something about that it just started the camaraderie
00:40:02.40 --> 00:40:08.80 just started building and I remember when we left Fort Walters to go to Fort Rucorale
00:40:08.80 --> 00:40:18.24 Alabama for our advanced training over for office that convoyed all the way to and we we made
00:40:18.24 --> 00:40:24.48 our first pit stop in Montgomery Alabama but we convoyed all the way down through there and we all
00:40:24.48 --> 00:40:29.36 had CBs in our cars so you know it was like we were flying and we were talking yesterday
00:40:29.36 --> 00:40:37.12 other and and and on the back of the car we everybody had uninestates army aviation
00:40:37.68 --> 00:40:42.24 and a little sticker in your back of your window you know and you know like I say we thought our
00:40:42.24 --> 00:40:49.44 Sierra didn't just think and we got to we got to Montgomery we all checked in that night
00:40:49.44 --> 00:41:01.92 and I got a call from the desk it said I've got you listed as owning a 1968 Osmo Bill 442
00:41:02.48 --> 00:41:08.40 it's black vinyl top with blue bottom I said yeah yeah that's that's mine
00:41:09.12 --> 00:41:14.72 you said sorry you need to come to the desk like go the desk and there's a truck driver there
00:41:14.72 --> 00:41:21.12 he had pulled his 18 wheeler into the parking lot of the motels where the four of us were all staying
00:41:22.40 --> 00:41:31.20 didn't cut sharp enough and hit the left rear quarter panel of my car and toward all the pieces
00:41:33.52 --> 00:41:38.48 I mean Schneider trucking I'll never forget you see there trucks on the road all the time
00:41:38.48 --> 00:41:44.08 and I'll forget to snuck oh and he was so apologetic and so on and called his
00:41:44.08 --> 00:41:52.000 dispatcher and everything was fine but anyhow we had a couple days before he had to report into
00:41:54.40 --> 00:41:59.36 Fort Rucker so my plan was I was going to drive the car up the North Carolina
00:42:00.08 --> 00:42:04.80 given to my dad they get it fixed up he'd give me his car I drive it down to to Rucker
00:42:05.60 --> 00:42:10.88 well we get up the next morning and I get a call from my roommate to the BIMA roommate
00:42:10.88 --> 00:42:20.56 in the primary training and he said hey goomba his name is John Vagniti hey goomba
00:42:21.92 --> 00:42:26.56 okay now the joke said what are you talking about John where's my car
00:42:27.84 --> 00:42:34.40 that's the that John I don't have your car oh come on come somebody had stolen his car that night
00:42:34.40 --> 00:42:41.68 now my car gets hit somebody still is John's car that night my government police does all the
00:42:41.68 --> 00:42:47.76 investigation and so the next so after that was done I said okay throw your Garamark car we're
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:55.76 driving at North Carolina so we drove to North Carolina picked up my dad's car in the meantime John
00:42:55.76 --> 00:43:04.16 calls his dad who owned a company called Superior plastics and in water I'll think of
00:43:04.16 --> 00:43:11.84 a minute but in New Jersey and any John has a new car waiting for him just like that from that but
00:43:12.80 --> 00:43:20.32 yeah that was that was the beginning of our our advanced course in flying helicopters for the
00:43:20.32 --> 00:43:24.96 United States Army so when you get to Rucker for Rucker is that when you start flying the Huey
00:43:24.96 --> 00:43:32.56 yeah yep it was and it was like everybody said the Huey came natural to me it was just I mean it was
00:43:32.56 --> 00:43:43.28 amazing to crank that thing up and and then to hold the cycle again pull up on that collective
00:43:43.28 --> 00:43:47.36 and I mean it was just it's like everybody said it's like going from a fiance onto a Rolls
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:54.64 Royce and it was so easy I mean it was you know even though had a law crosswind it wasn't shifting
00:43:54.64 --> 00:44:00.88 like the TH fit 5 in the TH fit 5 would shift if you had a 3 night crosswind so
00:44:00.88 --> 00:44:09.12 but it was an incredible incredible aircraft and of course while we were flying that we were also
00:44:09.12 --> 00:44:13.44 getting our instrument training down there it's the first time we'd been on instruments so the
00:44:13.44 --> 00:44:22.56 instrument training was not in the Huey it was in an OH13 and that's where we were under the hood and
00:44:22.56 --> 00:44:30.32 and flying on instruments and and got what we called a tac ticket tactical ticket it wasn't the
00:44:30.32 --> 00:44:36.88 regular standard instrument ticket that the woman normally get it was a tac ticket and what was
00:44:36.88 --> 00:44:42.08 interesting about that and this will come up later in our conversation is I learned how to shoot
00:44:42.08 --> 00:44:48.48 ground control approaches very well GCA approaches very well we'll talk about that later on in our
00:44:48.48 --> 00:44:54.16 conversation is that where you learned originally to shoot it that's where I learned to shoot it yep
00:44:54.16 --> 00:45:00.24 and it came in very handy and then so how much longer was it until you how long was that
00:45:00.24 --> 00:45:08.64 training um that training we got there and so that had to have been about I must have been about
00:45:08.64 --> 00:45:15.92 three three or so months because I think in July yeah it was in July that that I got my
00:45:15.92 --> 00:45:23.36 silver wings pinned on me and my mom and dad drove down it was a wonderful experience my
00:45:23.36 --> 00:45:28.72 girlfriend at the time came down with my parents and I was so proud of those wings I mean
00:45:28.72 --> 00:45:35.92 I was so proud of being a butter bar in December 67 and so proud of getting those wings
00:45:38.32 --> 00:45:46.08 later on that would have been in 69 because you know 68 I took over the command and went to
00:45:46.08 --> 00:45:53.76 flight school went through Christmas graduated in July 69 very proud of that I remember every weekend
00:45:53.76 --> 00:46:00.40 of while we were at Fort Rucker a bunch of us would go to Panama City Florida and there was a
00:46:00.40 --> 00:46:06.72 young couple and there are two children on a motel there so we went down to go shaded with them that
00:46:07.60 --> 00:46:15.04 we would like to come down every weekend and stay in the same suite of rooms and and they knew
00:46:15.04 --> 00:46:19.52 that we were everybody in flight school wasn't orders to go to Vietnam right out of flight school
00:46:19.52 --> 00:46:25.12 and they were certainly aware of that and so they took us up on our offer that we would arrive
00:46:25.12 --> 00:46:33.12 on front and night and leave on Sunday and she had a closet in the suite and she said you just
00:46:33.12 --> 00:46:37.76 keep all your beach closures everything down here I'll wash them I'll clean them up for you
00:46:37.76 --> 00:46:42.32 and I'll hang them back up in the suite and she did that every night every front and night we got
00:46:42.32 --> 00:46:49.84 down there she and her family had dinner prepared for the four of us and we all ate together as a family now
00:46:49.84 --> 00:47:00.80 that's that's people who cared and I took my parents there and right after we drove down to
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:07.60 Panama City after I got the silver wings and we stayed in that hotel that night and with them and
00:47:07.60 --> 00:47:14.16 we all congregated the family that owned it we all congregated together and then I left out the
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:20.40 the next day my parents stayed down all for a while but the next day was the landing on the move
00:47:22.32 --> 00:47:28.40 and we washed it after my girlfriend I washed that we got back into Hickory from driving from
00:47:29.12 --> 00:47:34.64 Panama City Florida and I wanted the things that when I first covered um
00:47:34.64 --> 00:47:40.80 Colonel Jackson's first book you know one of the statistics that he brings up in the book is
00:47:41.36 --> 00:47:45.76 there was 5000 Huey sent to Vietnam in 3200 of him were lost in combat
00:47:47.36 --> 00:47:53.76 did your parents know these kind of statistics were they nervous as hell were they talking to you
00:47:53.76 --> 00:48:00.32 about you know what was going to happen how did you feel about it um my parents
00:48:00.32 --> 00:48:07.92 I never expressed any worry whatsoever about being in fact I wanted to go to NAMM
00:48:09.04 --> 00:48:15.92 right after flight school there were too many infantry officers serving infantry aviators in Vietnam
00:48:15.92 --> 00:48:21.68 there were not enough slots for all the infantry aviators there were infantry aviators who were like
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:31.52 I'm third in line to be a battoon leader as a captain so what happened was all the infantry officers
00:48:31.52 --> 00:48:36.24 and my flight class at a rucker there were orders for change from Vietnam to state side of
00:48:36.24 --> 00:48:42.08 Samus so I went to Fort Bragg and flew with Alpha Company 82nd Aviation Battalion
00:48:43.04 --> 00:48:49.92 there I flew with seasoned aviators who had come back from Vietnam I was the battoon next
00:48:49.92 --> 00:48:54.16 home up a tunnel leader was captain Fred Dickens who had flown with the little bears the
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:59.28 25th infantry division he had flown over in a Cambodia during adding courage and a lot of
00:48:59.28 --> 00:49:05.76 that's written Cambodia is written up in Matt's first book there but I learned a lot from Fred I
00:49:05.76 --> 00:49:15.28 learned a lot from the other a lot of the war officers that were there who just uh Jim Foster for
00:49:15.28 --> 00:49:24.08 example he had flown with the 48th blue stars and learned a lot about him because we did a lot
00:49:24.08 --> 00:49:30.72 of tactical maneuvers with the 82nd during that time and he sort of gave me a feel for what I
00:49:30.72 --> 00:49:38.08 would be doing when I got to Vietnam Jim ended up being a roommate with myself and Fred Dickens
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:44.16 captain Dickens. Jim and I stayed friends until this day he was going to get out of the army and I
00:49:44.16 --> 00:49:50.96 talked him into staying in the army and encouraged him to extend his enlistment as a war officer
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:57.60 which he did and finally retired out of the army I hope sometime Jim can hear this podcast and
00:49:57.60 --> 00:50:05.36 can smile a little bit about that. What's very interesting is that after I put him my orders to go
00:50:05.36 --> 00:50:12.88 to Vietnam again requested none orders came down sending me to the seventh after division in Korea.
00:50:14.56 --> 00:50:19.60 Commanding the seventh after division was a god by the name of how more who was
00:50:19.60 --> 00:50:25.20 lieutenant Colonel how more in the I-Drain Valley with the first calf and we all know about
00:50:25.20 --> 00:50:31.44 we were soldiers once and young general more at that time was two star general and uh I was the
00:50:31.44 --> 00:50:37.12 seventh aviation battalion maintenance officer and when in general more was a rated aviation had to
00:50:37.12 --> 00:50:43.52 fly four months or four hours every month to maintain proficiency you draw a flight pay I don't know if
00:50:43.52 --> 00:50:48.96 you tell a general officer you can't draw a flight pay but it ain't right my job was to fly copal it
00:50:48.96 --> 00:50:55.36 with him and I got to know him and so this is this in Korea this is in Korea now so I've put
00:50:55.36 --> 00:51:04.96 in orders I put in requests to go to Vietnam towards come down send me to Korea okay so I was not that
00:51:04.96 --> 00:51:10.88 much aware of general more I didn't know about the I-Drain Valley back then I mean this was in 71
00:51:11.52 --> 00:51:18.56 I didn't know much about the I-Drain Valley not 71 I'm sorry this was in uh 70 when I got to
00:51:18.56 --> 00:51:27.52 Korea from Brag and so he asked me one day while we were flying how I liked my summit with the
00:51:27.52 --> 00:51:32.000 seventh and I told him it was fine but I said if I don't get to Vietnam sir I can kiss my career
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.12 good bye because I mean you know I want to be a career army officer and if I don't have Vietnam
00:51:37.12 --> 00:51:44.88 time and have performed well and I'll never be a career army officer and he talked a little bit
00:51:44.88 --> 00:51:48.96 he said would have a particular unit you want to go to and I said yes or I'd like to go to the
00:51:48.96 --> 00:51:55.20 25th effort division fly with the aviation attorney and he says any particular company I said
00:51:55.20 --> 00:51:59.20 Alpha Company sir they're known as a little bear she said I know the little bears I've heard
00:51:59.20 --> 00:52:06.40 the little bears are great in it um oh that was on Saturday oh Monday I got to call from the
00:52:06.40 --> 00:52:12.80 general's aide and it said general wants to make sure you're ready to get an arm I said yes I am
00:52:12.80 --> 00:52:18.24 okay you want to go to Alpha Company 25th aviation battalion oh the general wanted to know if
00:52:18.24 --> 00:52:25.28 you want to take any leave in the States I mean he can only authorize 20 days but I said what should
00:52:25.28 --> 00:52:32.96 I find get there within three or four days orders came down not been in Korea now
00:52:33.68 --> 00:52:41.76 maybe four or five months by that time orders came down and on usually orders and it probably
00:52:41.76 --> 00:52:46.96 is the same thing in the Navy you have you have regulations that authorize system such
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:54.40 there were no regulations authorizing anything on my orders it was all Voco which means voice command
00:52:54.40 --> 00:53:02.48 VOCO between commander-sector division commander 25th infantry division Voco and it went all the way
00:53:02.48 --> 00:53:12.16 down to even commander-a-arleeft out of Oakland and my leave my 20 days leave started and so anyhow
00:53:12.16 --> 00:53:18.48 I go to Kimpo Airport I get on airplane okay I fly home my 20 days didn't start until I reached my home
00:53:18.48 --> 00:53:26.80 of record and the 20 days was up the day that I left my home of record so I'm not on leave until I reach
00:53:26.80 --> 00:53:38.000 my point left there after 20 days flew to Oakland then Oakland to nom I get to nom and this is
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:45.68 in the fall of 70 I get to nom we're all getting off the airplane you know everybody here is
00:53:45.68 --> 00:53:51.04 about the humidity how it just sucks the air out of you when you get off the airplane landing
00:53:51.04 --> 00:53:58.48 and you get tons of new so get off the airplane okay there's a think of Lieutenant Colonel
00:53:58.48 --> 00:54:05.12 out there at a bunch of inlisted men and they say okay all the officers over to my right okay
00:54:05.12 --> 00:54:09.68 and then it started to make it okay all the NCOs in front of me and there's another E7
00:54:09.68 --> 00:54:14.16 that says okay all the list of men down here in this side so well get over there okay they're
00:54:14.16 --> 00:54:21.12 calling out names so the Colonel is a Colonel major is calling out all the officers names says
00:54:21.12 --> 00:54:25.44 there any name they have an air-based regional handset and they might have a call down I said here
00:54:25.44 --> 00:54:31.52 I mean you must be captain T I said what yes or I am he said well your truck will be here in 20 minutes
00:54:32.88 --> 00:54:39.52 and a trucker flew in from the 25th from Alpha Company 25th aviation battalion to pick me up
00:54:39.52 --> 00:54:47.92 oh yeah macro so pick me up take me to Koo Chi where the 25th air course yeah we get out of
00:54:47.92 --> 00:54:53.44 G must admit a hell of an infra-good impression 10 more on my good name a cheap pick some
00:54:53.44 --> 00:54:59.92 me up dross me to the orderly room and I yeah I go in and sleep to the company come on
00:54:59.92 --> 00:55:08.16 who's a major major's command accompanies and and and the major said I don't know who they are
00:55:08.16 --> 00:55:19.52 but welcome aboard check my check my hand and that was my introduction to the Alpha Company 25th
00:55:19.52 --> 00:55:27.04 aviation that's amazing you know you you made a joke about how to know if you can
00:55:27.84 --> 00:55:34.08 if you need to take the flight pay away from a general officer but apparently those general officers
00:55:34.08 --> 00:55:41.60 had some power that's incredible general how more and I've read the book I've watched the movie
00:55:41.60 --> 00:55:48.000 quite a few times even general more before he passed away thought that male Gibson did a good job
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:56.32 but representing him and in the sergeant major but you know that was he was a hell of a man
00:55:56.32 --> 00:56:03.76 a great leader he was he was not one of these general officers that said himself up on a
00:56:03.76 --> 00:56:12.40 plateau he was down with his troops and and and I saw that quality in him and I was in great
00:56:12.40 --> 00:56:21.60 admiration for that so you show up so you show up what's the first thing that happens when
00:56:21.60 --> 00:56:25.92 you show up and Vietnam now they what they they must have thought you were the best pilot or something
00:56:25.92 --> 00:56:34.72 that's how you were somebody the company exo company commander says exo get captain Tate
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:42.40 place to stay the echo exo said well sir where would you like to stay and I said well my buddy
00:56:42.40 --> 00:56:48.40 Fred Dickens captain Dickens he he stayed in a hooch called a holiday in he said is that still
00:56:48.40 --> 00:56:53.44 or any so yes or a holiday answer out of here he said let me say oh yeah there's the bunk available
00:56:53.44 --> 00:57:00.32 so I stayed in the same hoots that captain Dickens stayed in and after I got everything squared away
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:08.16 the exo said now there're going to be cocktails up here at captain so-and-so's place and
00:57:08.16 --> 00:57:13.12 he showed me where there was he said he said so come on up and meet the guys
00:57:13.12 --> 00:57:21.12 with this captain was great at fixing martinis so heck yeah I went up there and had a martini they
00:57:21.12 --> 00:57:29.92 had some order herbs out there and I thought wow this is it so this is really crazy so I was with them
00:57:29.92 --> 00:57:41.36 I'm right at two months into the first of November and orders came down for the 25th to draw
00:57:41.36 --> 00:57:48.48 down and prepared a head back to Hawaii and I thought to myself man this is really great I've been
00:57:48.48 --> 00:57:54.56 here too much now I'm going Hawaii and I'd already been laying out on top of a bunker in a lounge
00:57:54.56 --> 00:58:02.88 chair I had a nice sun tan and of course my dermatologist doesn't think it's a nice sun tan today but
00:58:02.88 --> 00:58:08.24 at any rate I thought wow this is going to be awesome I get Hawaii you know all are having
00:58:08.24 --> 00:58:16.000 a tan everything look good well no everyone who had less than six months in country got reassigned
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:26.80 so I found my younger era on a C1 30 several about a week or so later headed to a core there was
00:58:26.80 --> 00:58:33.52 no everything was pacified in three core where the 25th was I never flew into one hot LZ
00:58:33.52 --> 00:58:41.28 in fact I never flew into an LZ in three core that had all been pacified so I mean I had I never even
00:58:41.28 --> 00:58:48.24 heard the door gunners work out with the 25th because there was there was no enemy threat we
00:58:48.24 --> 00:58:57.12 thought at least at a time it wasn't apparent get on the C1 30 flami up to food by food by international
00:58:58.16 --> 00:59:07.36 I core very close to the north south of it in these border get off the aircraft
00:59:07.36 --> 00:59:16.16 got my parachute pack and bag with me full of my stuff pouring down rain and
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.92 they'll load us into building and say we're going to go to screaming equals
00:59:23.68 --> 00:59:32.64 orientation training and we did that for about a week and then it got reassigned to my regular unit
00:59:32.64 --> 00:59:41.20 now interested I was with alpha company 82nd aviation battalion when I got to the seventh
00:59:41.76 --> 00:59:47.20 I was actually assigned as a staff maintenance officer but I was located in alpha company
00:59:47.20 --> 00:59:54.88 seventh aviation battalion 25th I go to alpha company 25th where I get a sign with 101st aviation
00:59:54.88 --> 00:59:59.04 battalion alpha company 101st aviation battalion known as the comment chair of light
00:59:59.04 --> 01:00:08.96 that was the week after I had become a 101st air assault trooper
01:00:10.40 --> 01:00:15.12 then how long was it before you started flying missions with them took my checkeride the next day
01:00:16.80 --> 01:00:22.48 I was a Peter Pollett the following day when it had a hot LZ first time I'd ever heard
01:00:22.48 --> 01:00:29.20 the M60 machine gun door gunner and crew chief working out the ship literally danced when they
01:00:29.20 --> 01:00:36.96 pull that trigger you could fill the shake going in and going out hot LZ I heard ding ding
01:00:38.16 --> 01:00:44.72 three things on the aircraft came back and I I experienced what they call you got your cherry
01:00:44.72 --> 01:00:51.68 busted with took three rounds in the aircraft going out LZ came back that night
01:00:51.68 --> 01:00:57.60 once you got your cherry busted in the unit a lot of spread of core I mean the spread of
01:00:57.60 --> 01:01:03.36 core like you would what you would cause you've experienced that jockey but but I hadn't
01:01:03.36 --> 01:01:09.04 experienced anything like that and so what do we did yeah to get initiated before you could
01:01:09.04 --> 01:01:12.80 wear the unit patch and we had to drink the strength called a flame and hooker
01:01:12.80 --> 01:01:28.24 sounds tasty it was southern comfort and you take a matching a light so you got the blue flames coming
01:01:28.24 --> 01:01:39.76 up and that goes laughing here like he knows and had to drink it down all the way down
01:01:39.76 --> 01:01:45.44 set the glass down while the blue flame is still burning inside of it down turn it upside down
01:01:45.44 --> 01:01:52.88 and if more than two flaming drops came out of that glass you had to drink another until you
01:01:52.88 --> 01:02:00.40 got it down now keep in mind I was an RLO a real live officer all of the war officers
01:02:01.68 --> 01:02:06.08 they had a spread of core like you you've heard the war officer protective association
01:02:06.08 --> 01:02:13.20 wapa they took care of each other well they all most of them had mustaches what he could
01:02:13.20 --> 01:02:18.56 imagine drinking that flame hooker and you've got a mustache and that blue flame is coming up
01:02:18.56 --> 01:02:24.88 and there there were quite a few times that the the mustache has had to be put out and
01:02:24.88 --> 01:02:30.64 of course the bartender was there with a glass water he could throw over in our little
01:02:30.64 --> 01:02:37.12 washers club I was I was on a little assignment overseas and and we were in a bar and they had
01:02:37.12 --> 01:02:46.96 like a executive happy hour from you know four till six so we'd show up there at 359
01:02:46.96 --> 01:02:52.80 and it was free drink it was free drinks for two hours and I had like half a platoon with me
01:02:53.52 --> 01:02:58.48 so we're in there and this one I was a young and listed guy I was crazy and so we drink for the
01:02:58.48 --> 01:03:04.56 two hours and then we get done and now obviously everyone's primed but I remember telling the bartender
01:03:05.44 --> 01:03:10.88 we actually yeah we we we had run up quite the tab and I looked at the bartender I said we don't
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:16.64 want to drink anything else unless it's a fire so every drink we're sparing light and everything
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:25.44 off I was told you told me you know we all got a we all couldn't wait to a new guy came
01:03:25.44 --> 01:03:31.28 to the outfit and and that was in the oak club then listing guys got knows what was going on
01:03:31.28 --> 01:03:38.88 for the mistake but but we couldn't wait to you guy came in you know one of the things
01:03:38.88 --> 01:03:42.96 that Colonel Jackson talked about and wrote about was you know some of the flying that you
01:03:42.96 --> 01:03:48.72 doing when you're when you're formation flying and how it's so much closer than it was back
01:03:48.72 --> 01:03:53.12 in the states and then the the whole thing with the hover holes and getting down in there
01:03:53.12 --> 01:03:57.60 and having to listen to your crews like a hundred percent you can't see actually what they're
01:03:57.60 --> 01:04:01.36 telling you just have to trust them did you will you up to speed on that stuff or did you have
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:06.40 to just get the steep learning curve learn formation flying a foot rucker four four
01:04:06.40 --> 01:04:13.04 rucker one olive foot rucker I was confident I could fly that airplane I knew I could fly that thing
01:04:13.04 --> 01:04:21.28 and and we right where the Jesus nut is on on a hilly with which which holds the main
01:04:21.28 --> 01:04:28.48 rotor and there's like a red rubber gasket so what you would do is you would for the helicopter
01:04:28.48 --> 01:04:34.32 let's say we're flying an echelon left all the helicopters from the leader going to the left
01:04:34.32 --> 01:04:40.40 to fly formation and that you would come up and you would have you would put the red rubber
01:04:42.40 --> 01:04:49.68 grommet rod on rod about just below the windshield just at the lower end of it so that would keep
01:04:49.68 --> 01:04:54.56 your height above it so you wouldn't get caught up in a rotor wash from the helicopter but you
01:04:54.56 --> 01:05:01.12 would keep it up and then a staggered echelon left you've got the lead but every other helicopter
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:07.20 is a little bit harder than the ones in in front of them and we flew a lot of formation flying
01:05:07.20 --> 01:05:13.60 at rucker so I felt very comfortable with that and then I was very fortunate to go to the
01:05:13.60 --> 01:05:21.20 82nd after after flight school instead of going straight to non because I became even more
01:05:21.20 --> 01:05:30.16 proficient that and more proficient in in formation flying but there's one thing you learn
01:05:30.16 --> 01:05:38.80 in formation flying and non as you don't want to get too damn close because one round could take
01:05:38.80 --> 01:05:47.84 out too especially if it's 23 mic mic or 37 and you don't want to be flying through debris
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:58.32 so you did and we'll get talking about lambson 719 we did 22nd separations in that
01:05:59.68 --> 01:06:05.04 how long were you then with 101st before lambson went down okay
01:06:05.04 --> 01:06:14.72 so I got the 101st got into my unit a week before Thanksgiving of 70
01:06:17.36 --> 01:06:23.44 quick side story my cousin Charlie Finger was with the five of first signal battalion
01:06:23.44 --> 01:06:27.44 listed guy owned his second tour volunteered for his second tour
01:06:27.44 --> 01:06:34.40 I got a hold of Charlie brought him over to our unit took on the officers club
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:38.88 we had Thanksgiving dinner together and I think about that you're with your family
01:06:38.88 --> 01:06:48.24 having Thanksgiving dinner together November 1970 and it was just a wonderful day to see Charlie
01:06:48.24 --> 01:06:55.68 I never saw Charlie after that he derosed went home I said I told him I said
01:06:55.68 --> 01:07:05.76 Charlie I'll come over when not grab in you can be my guest at the artillery battalion
01:07:05.76 --> 01:07:10.96 they're because they always had the good shows the USO shows and the Korean shows with all the
01:07:10.96 --> 01:07:14.72 all-girl Korean bands I'll come over and get you one night he's and he said sir
01:07:14.72 --> 01:07:23.60 I said Charlie I'm your cousin he said sir wouldn't be safe for you as an officer to be around our barracks at night
01:07:26.16 --> 01:07:35.20 and you know frigging was a thing over there and it was so I took him to that and all right so
01:07:35.20 --> 01:07:41.52 make a long story short I'm flying combat missions I flew my first commandic
01:07:41.52 --> 01:07:48.16 control SOG missions probably by in December because they just didn't let anybody fly
01:07:49.04 --> 01:07:57.92 the commandic control north missions you had a chance to have three R&Rs or you have two R&Rs
01:07:57.92 --> 01:08:02.48 if one of your R&Rs you want to go back to the states so I'll let to go back to the states
01:08:02.48 --> 01:08:10.80 a week after a week after Christmas and went back spent a wonderful time with my family
01:08:11.84 --> 01:08:20.08 New Year's Eve there with Fred Dickens by the time his wife Moe CEO for a kept friend
01:08:20.72 --> 01:08:26.88 and I left about a week after after that to fly back to Vietnam
01:08:26.88 --> 01:08:37.76 got into Tonsonoot and tried to get a what to fly up racer said I need to get up to
01:08:38.32 --> 01:08:42.56 Fuba and the guy said sir there's there's a major major operation a big thing going on
01:08:42.56 --> 01:08:46.56 he said I don't know when I can get you out of here I said I got to get out here quick if there's
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:51.60 a major thing going I said he said we'll serve just stick around here and along behold within an hour
01:08:51.60 --> 01:09:01.36 they had a say say 123 flying that's 130 and one there's a big difference between those two
01:09:01.36 --> 01:09:06.24 R&Rs but you'd rather fly on a 130 anyhow say 120 there's only two engines
01:09:06.24 --> 01:09:12.24 so when you were flying those when you food sog missions I mean I look at the profile those
01:09:12.24 --> 01:09:18.64 sog missions that those guys were doing and it just it's it seems just completely crazy
01:09:18.64 --> 01:09:23.36 were you thinking that were you thinking okay here's whatever two Americans and four
01:09:23.36 --> 01:09:28.56 Vietnamese soldiers and gonna drop them off in the middle of Cambodia or Louson and we'll see what
01:09:28.56 --> 01:09:37.60 happens did that seem crazy to you you know it didn't it right off and I'll tell you what man
01:09:37.60 --> 01:09:44.48 we would fly down to a denying we flew out of three low with sock denying was the major base
01:09:44.48 --> 01:09:48.16 that was our headquarters there was one at food buy and there was one at country don't ha
01:09:48.16 --> 01:09:56.72 great the ones we flew out of denying were crazy I mean it was I mean that's like they got the
01:09:56.72 --> 01:10:03.04 music going everything and and it would flight follow with Kuvvi therefore fixed wing it would
01:10:03.04 --> 01:10:11.28 be up above us and and vector us and to where we're supposed to go I don't know how much of this
01:10:11.28 --> 01:10:16.48 I can I guess it's pretty declassified by now yeah well I mean it's pretty declassified it's been
01:10:16.48 --> 01:10:26.08 20 years was the okay so here's a mission we go in a we fly team man yeah we put them in an
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:33.44 area where Kuvvi has either told us or shot white white phosphorus down and landed and then
01:10:33.44 --> 01:10:40.96 we we spiraling go down into the landing zone spiraling go into the landing zone we drop them off
01:10:40.96 --> 01:10:47.60 then if they get into contact then we got to go back in there and pull them out which
01:10:47.60 --> 01:10:51.68 that did happen quite a few times a lot of times it didn't happen it didn't happen at all
01:10:52.32 --> 01:10:56.80 there were times we went in and they were in contact we had to pull them out with ropes
01:10:56.80 --> 01:11:02.80 McGuire rigs 120 foot ropes stretch 10 feet 130 foot they had to strap them on we had to pull
01:11:02.80 --> 01:11:07.04 them out of the had the jungle sometimes it was ladders that we would drop down and they'd
01:11:07.04 --> 01:11:17.20 climb up on the ladders and get out what and that was extractions whenever did we had
01:11:17.20 --> 01:11:21.36 we did some insertions with ropes too because they were going on on the side of a mountain
01:11:21.36 --> 01:11:28.64 there were no way with foliage and there was no way we could land so we would we would put
01:11:28.64 --> 01:11:34.72 it down but I remember times that I pulled the guys out on ladders and never to be there were three
01:11:34.72 --> 01:11:39.36 guys on my ladders now you gotta think about that the density out to you didn't what that
01:11:39.36 --> 01:11:44.96 does to lift the helicopter so we got them out and got them back in to Vietnam
01:11:46.24 --> 01:11:50.88 that's when you said oh my god we're back in Vietnam you know that's when you that's when you
01:11:50.88 --> 01:11:56.88 start to realize it and we came in and we had to land in a like a rice paddy so these
01:11:56.88 --> 01:12:03.28 guys could get off the ladders and get back in our our choppers and you just didn't and any
01:12:03.28 --> 01:12:11.84 moment you just felt like this is it I'm gonna I'm a bite and a couple of our guys did and
01:12:13.44 --> 01:12:22.32 combinatorial north missions and died and a lot of the saw guys went with them so that's you
01:12:22.32 --> 01:12:31.60 know that's the bad part of all 14 guys the year I was in but here's one mission we flew in we we
01:12:31.60 --> 01:12:38.88 were gonna insert a team landed in the LZ big elephant grass probably eight feet high
01:12:39.76 --> 01:12:46.24 runner wash lays the grass down and when it did the whole LZ was ring with the V8 and our door
01:12:46.24 --> 01:12:49.76 gonna start to working out and firing everybody's firing and everybody's in surrogate tell
01:12:49.76 --> 01:12:54.16 I get to hell out here and we were firing firing we were taking rounds two but nobody nobody
01:12:54.16 --> 01:13:01.20 nobody aboard our aircraft was injured I mean that's just one thing we would do personal raids
01:13:02.56 --> 01:13:10.48 Intel would tell us where there was a big NBA battalion headquarters we had we had all the
01:13:10.48 --> 01:13:15.44 all the intel on it we knew the comings and goings had been watching the Washington watch
01:13:16.56 --> 01:13:23.76 and we've afli out flot of four the the third aircraft was always had the medical on the
01:13:23.76 --> 01:13:29.04 fourth aircraft was the aircraft that would pull your ass out if you guys shot down first two
01:13:29.04 --> 01:13:36.000 aircraft would go in I happened to be on the second aircraft on one of these personal raids where we
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.44 went in a land at right in the down middle of a battalion in the abatai and headquarters the
01:13:41.44 --> 01:13:47.04 Gazon board jump out I bet you we weren't on the ground 20 seconds and they're coming back in they've
01:13:47.04 --> 01:13:53.52 got captives they've got all sorts of documents in our hand we get back on that ship and
01:13:53.52 --> 01:14:01.44 were our asses out of there going to the nine I mean that's the and it was exciting I mean I'm
01:14:01.44 --> 01:14:10.48 not gonna tell you the anxiety one there but I was scared that was exciting and it would come
01:14:10.48 --> 01:14:19.36 back in the half coal bears I mean that's so cheap yeah another day at sag so I guess you did
01:14:19.36 --> 01:14:26.88 think those missions were a little bit crazy but but it was fun crazy you know we were young we didn't
01:14:26.88 --> 01:14:33.60 know any better I guess to fly on today I probably couldn't see the damn instruments
01:14:36.56 --> 01:14:41.04 so you're flying you fly in a bunch of those missions and now you're I mean sounds like you're
01:14:41.04 --> 01:14:47.84 racking up some pretty good hours and some pretty good experience at doing it and and then so
01:14:47.84 --> 01:14:52.64 so lamson when did you so you got back from your your Christmas and New Year's leave so that's
01:14:52.64 --> 01:14:59.36 January whatever yes it's a lip part of January you come back and now it's um it's you get told immediately
01:14:59.36 --> 01:15:02.72 hey there's some kind of big operation we don't really know what it does but you got to get up there
01:15:04.56 --> 01:15:10.24 no they just said there's a big operation going on an awkward and and they and I said I got to get
01:15:10.24 --> 01:15:17.12 up there I told them I'm a ton commander up there I've got to get up there yeah my guys maybe up there
01:15:17.12 --> 01:15:28.000 this up so anyhow I get up there it's very well that it's kept quiet so when I got into my unit
01:15:28.64 --> 01:15:33.52 and said what the hell's going on people kind of looked at me like what are you talking about and
01:15:33.52 --> 01:15:39.60 I told them all about that and my company commander knew about it major cool Bob Kloel he's in the
01:15:39.60 --> 01:15:47.04 book you know Bob knew about it but anyway that's why I told you that prior and this was in January
01:15:47.04 --> 01:15:56.000 we take a a sock mission out of uh CC a mission out of a Dong Ha and we're flying towards
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:05.28 Leo Shumboar crossing in the vicinity a case on when those red balls of orange balls of far
01:16:05.28 --> 01:16:11.60 start coming up at us and we have to take a base of action or get shot down by 23 Mike Mike
01:16:11.60 --> 01:16:21.20 or 37 up no so we knew and and see as far as as far as I'm concerned that was reconnaissance
01:16:21.20 --> 01:16:27.12 M prep four and that wasn't just one reconnaissance that was just one of many reconnaissance
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:33.84 M prep four Lamson 719 so the the premise of Lamson 719 and again the the book
01:16:33.84 --> 01:16:40.16 undunited values it's volume three Lamson the subtitles Lamson 719 the premise of the
01:16:40.16 --> 01:16:50.08 operation is that America wanted to go into louse and shut down the Ho Chi Mintrell they also
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:56.16 America didn't want to put any troops any American troops on the ground inside allows
01:16:57.36 --> 01:17:02.64 because they didn't like the way that looked politically so they decided well we'll run the
01:17:02.64 --> 01:17:10.88 operation using South Vietnamese soldiers but in order to actually execute the operation they were
01:17:10.88 --> 01:17:16.88 going to need to have American aviation because America was the only one really capable of
01:17:16.88 --> 01:17:22.48 doing that job of air lifting all these South Vietnamese soldiers in the louse and then on top of
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:25.92 that if you're going to use the helicopters then we're going to use the air support to in the
01:17:25.92 --> 01:17:32.96 air assets so that that's sort of the premise of the operation and it's a big operation to go like
01:17:32.96 --> 01:17:38.000 I said the goal is to kind of put it put a halt on on the the portion of Ho Chi Mintrell that ran
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.08 through louse and and and and and and and and and the head waters of that was in the town of
01:17:44.08 --> 01:17:56.16 Simone so that was the final objective was to capture Simone it's failed to TCEP O and it's got a weird
01:17:56.16 --> 01:18:01.84 spell yeah it's got a weird spell yeah that that was the goal and that was kind of that
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:06.72 Simone was the furthest away the fur the deepest in the louse that we get to there would be
01:18:06.72 --> 01:18:12.48 correct the furthest north of the Ho Chi Mintrell called it the head waters of the Ho Chi Mintrell
01:18:12.48 --> 01:18:21.36 I would say there's also and and reading about it there was also the underlying goal was
01:18:21.36 --> 01:18:27.44 to sort of prove that the South Vietnamese military could conduct these operations that they were
01:18:27.44 --> 01:18:31.36 capable that they were capable of doing these kind of things that was part of Nixon's
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:38.48 victimization policy the more that the South Vietnamese could prove that they could
01:18:38.48 --> 01:18:45.92 take care of themselves and defend their homeland than the less there was need of US forces
01:18:45.92 --> 01:18:53.36 especially ground forces so you're saying that you're your company commander kind of new about it
01:18:53.36 --> 01:18:59.04 when you showed up there I have to think he did because major clothing did not seem
01:18:59.04 --> 01:19:08.16 a really surprised in fact if I recall and I hope I'm not making this up but if I recall he seems to
01:19:08.16 --> 01:19:16.24 prize that I made it up in a quick autonomous I did from from Saigon now prior to the actual
01:19:16.24 --> 01:19:26.56 execution of Lamson 719 there was another operation that was to push up to to the case on combat base
01:19:26.56 --> 01:19:32.96 there off of route 9 it's called duicane into that now did you participate in duicane into
01:19:32.96 --> 01:19:36.40 you know I have to think I did but I'm not it's kind of hard to
01:19:39.44 --> 01:19:45.44 because I flew so much I mean I flew over 1200 hours and I'm 950 of which were actual combat missions
01:19:47.20 --> 01:19:56.40 so I have to think that I did I never recall flying any what the call convoy support
01:19:56.40 --> 01:20:03.20 a lot of that would have been done by Charlie Marl and in Cobra gunships to take action
01:20:05.92 --> 01:20:11.12 no doubt in my mind that I fly supporting operations for duicane into
01:20:12.56 --> 01:20:18.88 but I never quite tagged it as as duicane into
01:20:20.64 --> 01:20:25.04 hell I had so much going on anyhow I've tried to keep my one armorses enlisted man
01:20:25.04 --> 01:20:31.84 and ten helicopters fly but the point of operation duicane into was to push up into
01:20:32.64 --> 01:20:39.04 case on which and get control of it and then that was going to then be used as a logistics hub
01:20:39.04 --> 01:20:46.24 and an air hub to conduct this big operation um Lamson 719 that's what the purpose was
01:20:46.24 --> 01:20:53.60 but in addition to that too was to put the south of it in these army in a position
01:20:53.60 --> 01:21:02.000 to where they could readily launch across the border so pre-staging all these folks all these soldiers
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.08 out there and get them ready the the the area that you were going into
01:21:11.04 --> 01:21:16.72 had some serious enemy troops in there you know the you know some of the estimates I read
01:21:16.72 --> 01:21:23.12 7,000 combat troops on the ground in that area of Lousy 10,000 support personnel
01:21:25.52 --> 01:21:32.56 another another 5,000 path of Lousy fighters so it was this was you were going into tough
01:21:32.56 --> 01:21:37.68 country 33,000 total is the estimate that's pretty much kicked around
01:21:38.88 --> 01:21:45.36 of all of all the categories you you just described so when did you win did you actually find out
01:21:45.36 --> 01:21:51.60 that that this mission was going down we got the briefing on at the mission actually
01:21:52.72 --> 01:22:03.92 started on 8 February of 71 by that time hunter first command post was in operation at case on
01:22:06.16 --> 01:22:12.48 general berry was up there Matt Jackson features a lot of berry in the book
01:22:12.48 --> 01:22:16.64 and I have some stories about that that I'll share with you later on
01:22:19.52 --> 01:22:26.000 off-loose several missions in support of that taking troops into
01:22:28.16 --> 01:22:32.80 hill 30 hill 31 range of arv and ranges were in 31
01:22:32.80 --> 01:22:43.44 we flew so we have pick-up zones pz if you will at various stage of wetland and then
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:55.36 take them to the to the LZ around there but that was just in prep 4 and really
01:22:55.36 --> 01:23:09.60 the big action for me the thing that I guess made me realize that my god there's a real war going
01:23:09.60 --> 01:23:16.64 on was in LZ Lollo which is on the third of March yeah I'll tell you one thing that's interesting
01:23:16.64 --> 01:23:24.16 when you read this book and when you hear about this this operation you know most of the time
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:28.88 when you think of oh what the what the Vietnamese are doing it's sort of like what the North Vietnamese
01:23:28.88 --> 01:23:33.84 doing what the Vietnamese are doing it's sort of like a hit and run it doesn't seem like these big
01:23:33.84 --> 01:23:38.88 conventional operations and if they did do a big assault on a base you know they kind of do it
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:46.80 they they'd mess some things up and then they'd leave they were doing big coordinated attacks
01:23:46.80 --> 01:23:52.40 against the south Vietnamese forces it this was almost like bordering in fact this was like conventional
01:23:52.40 --> 01:24:00.72 warfare correct and but you didn't see that rod on eight fabulous that came later on
01:24:02.48 --> 01:24:13.20 and it was devastating to to witness some of what I witnessed after the third of March what I
01:24:13.20 --> 01:24:20.16 witnessed on the ground with the south of it and the me's army especially when we would go into
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:34.80 a resupply around hill 30 and hill 31 I saw some heroism but I saw so many are the arvin army of the
01:24:34.80 --> 01:24:39.84 south of it me's army saw so many of the soldiers throw the weapons on the ground and run to
01:24:39.84 --> 01:24:46.40 grab onto our skids so that when we lifted off we'd pull them out of the battle space that was
01:24:46.40 --> 01:24:52.56 disheartening it was horrible yeah I remember reading one part where it's exactly what you said
01:24:52.56 --> 01:25:01.28 a resupply comes in and the the helicopters as they leave they're overloaded with arvin soldiers that
01:25:01.28 --> 01:25:06.80 are just trying to get out of there throw the weapons on the ground and run and grab onto a skid
01:25:06.80 --> 01:25:16.72 I mean I witnessed soldiers losing their grip and falling 1500 2000 feet to the ground below
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:25.44 and and if sank to you feel sorry for them or do you say you coward you got what's coming to you
01:25:26.48 --> 01:25:33.76 and you know it got to the point Jocca where we would I remember landing it in
01:25:33.76 --> 01:25:42.000 and I can't remember I think it was 31 that I landed in but we were landing where motors were
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.96 blowing up right in front of us and we would have to maneuver over eminent and motors were flying
01:25:47.68 --> 01:25:55.52 we're hitting everywhere in the LSE and we would literally come to about a 10 foot hover kick off the
01:25:55.52 --> 01:26:00.56 supplies can't come into the law because they would jump on your ship and even at a 10 foot hover
01:26:00.56 --> 01:26:07.28 they would run jump on people's back and they would hoof them up onto the skid I mean a 10 foot hover
01:26:08.88 --> 01:26:16.40 and and you start to wonder well when's it gonna be my day you know and I remember having this
01:26:17.68 --> 01:26:25.60 thing to can't see my mind is you know I know I'm gonna die so I'm not gonna worry about dying
01:26:25.60 --> 01:26:29.60 I'm not gonna die just don't let me get shot up subab I mother can't
01:26:31.76 --> 01:26:39.52 recognize me but I knew I was I was gonna get it I just and then I didn't didn't bother me anymore
01:26:39.52 --> 01:26:48.08 it did not bother me anymore I about dying I accepted the fact that was gonna happen and you
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:57.76 got to take care of me and a mother would recognize me I haven't that feel no and then see in the
01:26:57.76 --> 01:27:04.000 South Vietnamese just you're doing all you can to help them out risking your lives and they're
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.20 just wanting to get out of there we picked up body bags of the South Vietnamese body bags for U.S.
01:27:11.20 --> 01:27:16.88 forces and you've seen them they're sturdy they're zippered the body bags for the South Vietnamese
01:27:16.88 --> 01:27:22.24 forces were like one hour martin ice and bags little thin plastic bags had bodies in them they had
01:27:22.24 --> 01:27:31.20 laid out in the sun for for several days they were all bloated in body fluids filling up inside the
01:27:31.20 --> 01:27:38.64 body bags and and that's the one time where we really put skids on the ground so they could load up
01:27:38.64 --> 01:27:42.88 bodies and of course the Vietnamese didn't run in jump on air crack cause they didn't want to run
01:27:42.88 --> 01:27:50.32 and jump on all those bodies that were bloated and it got to the point where we had to where we had
01:27:50.32 --> 01:27:56.72 to wear gas map one of us in the cockpit had a gas mask because of the smell was just nauseating
01:27:57.44 --> 01:28:05.44 and we would bring them back into case on or Elsie Brown wherever where a pickup zone was
01:28:06.16 --> 01:28:10.80 and the South Vietnamese troops had unloaded the bodies and I remember I remember one it just
01:28:10.80 --> 01:28:16.08 it just the guy grabbed the arm of a body and what he tried to pull the body out the whole arm
01:28:16.08 --> 01:28:27.12 came out of the out of the body it was just sickening it was beyond it was beyond anything that
01:28:27.12 --> 01:28:35.36 most humans would ever experience and you know you you you you go through that and you say well
01:28:35.36 --> 01:28:43.44 what's the purpose why are we why are we here why are we doing this I had a warm officer who I asked
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:49.44 of during lamps on to ask I said I need more people to fly this mission he said I'm not going to
01:28:49.44 --> 01:28:55.52 fly the mission I said I need you I'm not going to fly I said why not he said because nobody cares
01:28:55.52 --> 01:28:59.68 Congress doesn't care whether I live or die and what's the use look what they're doing up there
01:28:59.68 --> 01:29:06.72 and I said well mister and I will say his name but you got to do what you got to do he had too many
01:29:06.72 --> 01:29:12.32 hours you know he had over 140 hours flying at months so he was he was way within his legal rights
01:29:12.32 --> 01:29:17.76 to sound like not flying anymore but guess what most always had that as well most always were flying
01:29:19.76 --> 01:29:27.52 I mean dead tired and we did it and but you know that's starting to be thinking who cares who really cares
01:29:27.52 --> 01:29:33.68 whether we do whether we do or not whether we die or whether we come over alive I mean look
01:29:33.68 --> 01:29:38.08 what the south fit needs to do in vitmization yeah tell me about it Richard next I won't
01:29:38.08 --> 01:29:43.36 you over here at lamps on seven one nine looking at this and then you tell me vitmization
01:29:47.12 --> 01:29:54.40 it made me a change person and we hadn't even talked about LZ Lola
01:29:54.40 --> 01:30:02.000 yeah I mean LZ Lola came a little into the operation I mean I just kind of want to run through
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.56 a little bit of the timeline of so this this operation starts on February 8th but there's
01:30:09.68 --> 01:30:18.32 4,000 arv and that are going in on on route 9 the 39th Ranger battalion is he load into LZ
01:30:18.32 --> 01:30:26.40 Ranger the first infantry divisions going into LZ blue and Don white and brown and FSB's hotel
01:30:26.40 --> 01:30:32.96 delta delta one and again the the book gives such good detail on all sides the planning what
01:30:32.96 --> 01:30:39.92 the how the decisions were being made it's just it's a fantastic recounting of what happened
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:46.48 and meanwhile still Vietnam you still got bad weather you still got low clouds you got heavy
01:30:46.48 --> 01:30:55.76 anti aircraft fire the there's a lot of air strikes are happening so you know the B52s
01:30:55.76 --> 01:31:05.12 are dropping bombs arc lights yeah the but look there's a lot of a lot of NVA up there and they're
01:31:05.12 --> 01:31:12.80 they're ready to fight then they start actually attacking like I said like like by
01:31:12.80 --> 01:31:22.32 I don't know February 16th 17th the the NVA starts doing organized attacks and
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:31.12 really bringing it to to the to the people to the to the south Vietnamese soldiers that are now on the ground
01:31:31.12 --> 01:31:42.48 um and here's the here's another thing that I was reading about by February 24th
01:31:43.44 --> 01:31:49.92 there were reports coming back that the that the North Vietnamese had completed a new route
01:31:49.92 --> 01:31:54.48 and they were just going around that area of the Ho Chi Minh Trail they were just you know okay
01:31:54.48 --> 01:31:57.76 well you guys want to block that cool we'll just we had another alternate route
01:31:57.76 --> 01:32:07.76 so February 25th just a massive North Vietnamese assault and it's combined arms they got armor
01:32:07.76 --> 01:32:13.28 they got artillery they got infantry assault they're doing combined arms assaults again this is
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:18.80 not what we typically think of in Vietnam I know it happened from time to time but it's not what you
01:32:18.80 --> 01:32:24.08 generally think of in Vietnam you don't think of pitched conventional warfare like we're doing with here
01:32:24.08 --> 01:32:34.08 um there's just yeah yeah the the one quote I got was 94 there's a helicopter
01:32:34.08 --> 01:32:42.96 resupply to FSB 30 and 94 south Vietnamese soldiers forced their way onto the helicopters
01:32:42.96 --> 01:32:49.12 to get out of there including the commander that's on March 2nd by the way
01:32:49.12 --> 01:32:57.92 uh we get to March 3rd which which you've discussed a few times and and
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:07.76 well actually let me jump into this small small portion of the book here that that talks about
01:33:08.72 --> 01:33:14.88 some of what you guys were doing I'm gonna go to the book here one officer Doug Walmack
01:33:14.88 --> 01:33:21.52 Wratler 28 and chalk 3 considered aborting his approach watching Arnie being shot down and hearing
01:33:21.52 --> 01:33:27.12 flight lead calling for mission abort not hearing anything else about aborting the mission he decided
01:33:27.12 --> 01:33:32.80 he needed to insert his load of arv and soldiers unbeknownst to him was the fact that no arv and
01:33:33.28 --> 01:33:35.52 had survived in the first two aircraft
01:33:37.60 --> 01:33:42.08 approaching the landing zone he was subjected to the same intense fire as the chalks perform
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:46.72 upon landing an RPG rocker was fired but slammed into a stump and exploded
01:33:46.72 --> 01:33:52.08 showering the aircraft with shrapnel when it did time stood still for Mr. Walmack
01:33:52.08 --> 01:33:55.60 as it seemed he could count the main rotor passing in front of the aircraft
01:33:56.72 --> 01:34:01.20 several rounds ripped across the aircraft from three bursts of AK 47 fire
01:34:01.92 --> 01:34:06.96 the broder blades cabin lower fuselage and skids all received the damage
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:13.28 as the aircraft lifted out of the landing zone hammer blows were felt by the pilot look
01:34:13.28 --> 01:34:19.68 and the pilot looked back not only were there holes in the floor of the cargo area but strange
01:34:19.68 --> 01:34:25.92 sounds told him that the main rotor might have taken some hits as well chalk 4 followed chalk
01:34:25.92 --> 01:34:31.20 3 into the landing zone where it received intense small arms fire crashed and burned
01:34:31.20 --> 01:34:35.92 chalk 4 crew scrambled back to chalk 5 and rode out
01:34:36.72 --> 01:34:42.56 this kept up as each chalk came into the landing zone to drop off the arv and soldiers on board
01:34:43.52 --> 01:34:46.40 chalk 16 comment Kevin Chero
01:34:47.36 --> 01:34:52.16 304 by Bob Morris entered the culture of fire and landed
01:34:53.04 --> 01:34:56.96 like everyone before him he could feel and hear the hits on his aircraft
01:34:56.96 --> 01:35:03.28 we're on fire someone said over the road radio but didn't identify themselves Morris pulled
01:35:03.28 --> 01:35:08.64 in power and initiated his takeoff very calmly he heard his crew chief say over the intercom
01:35:09.20 --> 01:35:15.12 Mr. Morris you do know we're on fire don't you Mr. Morris quickly returned to the landing zone
01:35:15.12 --> 01:35:21.92 and exited the aircraft chalk 18 approached the landing zone at 90 knots air speed instead of the usual
01:35:21.92 --> 01:35:28.000 40 knots when so close he picked out his landing point just as a mortar round exploded at that spot
01:35:28.72 --> 01:35:33.76 suddenly his tail dropped low and the nose went high as captain Tate went into a hard
01:35:33.76 --> 01:35:38.88 deceleration with numerous hammer taps on the aircraft three feet from his touchdown point
01:35:38.88 --> 01:35:44.72 there was a loud explosion explosion a gaping hole appeared in the window frame and there was
01:35:44.72 --> 01:35:50.000 the smell of hot metal engine oil pressure was no longer steady but fluctuating
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.48 arvon soldiers had no desire to wait for him to land and go out of the aircraft to safety
01:35:54.48 --> 01:36:00.64 of a prone position on the ground pulling in an armpit of collective Tate's aircraft
01:36:00.64 --> 01:36:05.92 tail number 049 raised out of the landing zone with the hail of small arms bullets
01:36:05.92 --> 01:36:12.96 chief chasing after him his aircraft had flown its last mission within an hour only 19 of the
01:36:12.96 --> 01:36:32.24 40 year craft were able to enter the landing zone 19 out of 40 year craft were able to enter the landing zone
01:36:32.24 --> 01:36:40.000 Mars crashed in the landing zone came back in crash with another aircraft when in bird
01:36:40.88 --> 01:36:46.88 flumbaburke he crashed in the LZ they were on the ground one of the copolits kept in
01:36:48.08 --> 01:36:54.80 Jerry Cruz comment show been a second to him Vietnam first terror to his Ranger
01:36:56.08 --> 01:37:01.92 Jerry was on the ground with a prick 25 radio calling in air strikes and actually conducting the
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:11.12 ground warfare in the LZ because the arvon officer major just Jerry knew what he was doing
01:37:12.48 --> 01:37:17.12 Jerry was the one that eventually said we got we got to halt this because there's too much crap
01:37:17.12 --> 01:37:26.72 going on in here and Kirk Latter obviously took it and we stopped the insertion for a while
01:37:26.72 --> 01:37:34.24 back and picked it back up again later on the afternoon that morning I we got hit by rocket
01:37:34.24 --> 01:37:40.32 propeller grenade as you've described the gaping hole in the windshield hit the windshield struck
01:37:40.32 --> 01:37:46.40 it was shot at about a 45 degree angle so when it hit the windshield exploded out instead of
01:37:46.40 --> 01:37:53.52 exploding in crout cheese said sir sir sir get ass out of here get ass out of here sir sir
01:37:53.52 --> 01:37:57.92 the nuts the inter panel which is our control warning lights look like a Christmas tree you
01:37:57.92 --> 01:38:06.08 look up and we took off it within within several seconds we started feeling harshness in the
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:14.08 controls the hydraulic system warning light was blinking and within within another short amount of
01:38:14.08 --> 01:38:20.64 time we lost all hydraulics took both of us on the controls to select going down a highway at
01:38:20.64 --> 01:38:27.68 85 miles narrow to Paris during goes out and you're coming up on some major curves it took us
01:38:27.68 --> 01:38:34.24 both on the controls we're finally able to get it back in called emergency case on
01:38:36.56 --> 01:38:42.72 we were like number two or three emergency at that time guys ahead of us who had
01:38:42.72 --> 01:38:52.40 gotten blown up on low low and we got it down we we had to make a low slow and we thought
01:38:52.40 --> 01:38:57.76 we're gonna get shot out of the sky just trying to get in the land at on the pierced steel
01:38:57.76 --> 01:39:06.32 plinking or under way at case on but my god it was a textbook landing and we were able to
01:39:06.32 --> 01:39:13.68 get her down and no sooner than we got it down a nasty aircraft to do some half of the chain pull
01:39:13.68 --> 01:39:19.36 pull the aircraft right off the wrong way getting ready for another another person calling emergency
01:39:21.92 --> 01:39:28.000 I remember Colonel Fernando Bobby Fennander he was our retired commander
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.68 hunter first aviation battalion which was part of the hundred first aviation group
01:39:31.68 --> 01:39:36.80 commander about Colonel Davis you'll see Davis's name in that book Fennander is also mentioned in that
01:39:36.80 --> 01:39:42.56 book but for an honor comes out and sort of those his arms around us like God I'm so glad you
01:39:42.56 --> 01:39:49.52 got me it and he said come on there's another briefing going on in the tent so we all
01:39:49.52 --> 01:39:55.68 round over to the big briefing tent and your your aircraft was is it the correct word total
01:39:55.68 --> 01:40:01.12 yeah couldn't be flown again couldn't be flown again yeah now whether they hooked it out of there
01:40:01.12 --> 01:40:06.64 and got it repaired or what but it shot out hydraulics we had 47 holes on that aircraft that morning
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:14.08 we counted the holes in the aircraft 47 holes and lost hydraulics and the any of you guys any
01:40:14.08 --> 01:40:23.84 of your guys get wounded in the aircraft not amazing isn't that amazing I mean just it just blows my mind
01:40:23.84 --> 01:40:29.04 but for an honor came out I thought it was interesting here's Lieutenant Colonel coming out
01:40:29.04 --> 01:40:33.36 and it's like welcome this home and all right we got to get in the briefing tent we got this thing
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:39.52 and we had a briefing tent for the we were in the briefing tent Kirk Latter all were
01:40:39.52 --> 01:40:47.44 Kirk Latter's commander 223 aviation battalion and told us about the afternoon mission we
01:40:47.44 --> 01:40:53.36 got to get back in there we got more troops to insert and alone and and Colonel Fernando looked
01:40:53.36 --> 01:40:57.68 at me and he said I'm sure you want to go in there fly to your to your crews are on the ground
01:40:57.68 --> 01:41:03.68 and they're just so I don't know how to have an aircraft he said we take mine I said sorry said take
01:41:03.68 --> 01:41:09.60 mine but the only thing you got to take my crew chief with you and and then he put me aside he said
01:41:09.60 --> 01:41:13.20 now listen that's a brand new aircraft don't you bring that thing back to where you brought
01:41:13.20 --> 01:41:19.12 first back the sporting acid yes sir well you didn't know bay that order very well did you
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:25.84 know because I fifty eight holes in his aircraft when we got back that afternoon we were able
01:41:25.84 --> 01:41:31.12 to rescue the guys off the ground so talk us through that so sir you launch again to go back into
01:41:31.12 --> 01:41:35.52 this is by the way this is LZ low low you call it Lulu low low low yeah it's not your
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:42.16 defra- low uh low little Brigida they were all named after Liza's after Elizabeth Taylor
01:41:42.80 --> 01:41:48.72 what was the other one but I can't think of a name right now but they were all named after a Hollywood
01:41:48.72 --> 01:41:57.12 star that's but uh so you get the briefing of okay we got guys on the ground we got to go back in there
01:41:57.12 --> 01:42:01.44 and you just have forty seven holes in your aircraft when you saw a bunch of your friends get
01:42:01.44 --> 01:42:05.76 shot down you saw a bunch of other aircraft get shot down that are sitting in the LZ now you get
01:42:05.76 --> 01:42:11.20 brought in the briefing room hey you got to go again you said don't have an aircraft aircraft
01:42:11.20 --> 01:42:18.000 the boss says you can take mine bratt didn't even have twenty five hours on brand new here we
01:42:18.80 --> 01:42:28.88 and the only one cave out you got to take my crew chief okay so we get to start we get to say no okay
01:42:28.88 --> 01:42:36.16 let's crank them oh and by the way there was no unit integrity anymore I mean we were just all
01:42:36.16 --> 01:42:42.88 kind of all big you know like all of us who ever could be in a bird whoever could go and so
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:51.84 we take off we have troops on board we take off we put put those troops on the ground
01:42:54.16 --> 01:42:58.72 and I'm hovering around for a few sex to make sure the our guys have gotten off they were picked
01:42:58.72 --> 01:43:02.80 up by commentaries in front of me but I wanted to make sure that we had our bioth ground
01:43:02.80 --> 01:43:08.48 and by that time where as you described the hammer taps on the screen never I mean it was just
01:43:08.48 --> 01:43:15.60 all over and and it's like I said earlier somebody was like I said take your bare hand and grab a
01:43:15.60 --> 01:43:25.76 wasp and that's what it was like and so again the same scenario taking all these heads thank god
01:43:25.76 --> 01:43:34.16 didn't get hit by an RPG but the nonsia panel listening all the circuit if a major system
01:43:34.16 --> 01:43:38.64 goes down or is damaged you have a little light that flashes on and on that light it says for
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:43.84 example hydraulics so you know something's happened to your hydraulic system tell rotor
01:43:43.84 --> 01:43:49.36 knows something's happened to your teller so but the one that got me that started flashing was
01:43:49.36 --> 01:43:59.68 main rotor transmission what does that mean? transmission the transmission rotor yeah okay so it
01:43:59.68 --> 01:44:08.80 means what it says yeah yeah and we got her back on the ground we'll come to the hover
01:44:08.80 --> 01:44:17.68 we put it down at case on and the main rotor locked seized turned the chopper almost
01:44:17.68 --> 01:44:23.76 two hundred seventy degrees around from our landing head there were actually bailed tech reps
01:44:24.96 --> 01:44:31.44 up at case on looking at damage and what because they were riding their reports for
01:44:32.24 --> 01:44:37.36 hey this and this what we need to improve on on the newer models of the hui they were riding
01:44:37.36 --> 01:44:42.72 their reports they got told me he said sure you're very lucky he said you could have had
01:44:42.72 --> 01:44:48.56 that transmission could have seized in the air he said you guys wouldn't be here and it
01:44:48.56 --> 01:45:00.64 seized on the ground for an enter came over fifty holes that had wrapped and a locked seized
01:45:00.64 --> 01:45:12.08 through the misdeceased transmission that that that helicopter obviously didn't fly again that day that's two of them one day
01:45:13.84 --> 01:45:21.36 we uh I say we'd lost a lot of aircraft that day and it was getting night time
01:45:21.36 --> 01:45:30.96 um we had this guy that liked to fix this stuff called common trails stew and uh there were
01:45:32.24 --> 01:45:39.92 on case on there was actually wild onions jica pulled out of the ground and uh he had a bunch
01:45:39.92 --> 01:45:45.28 of guys collected that and they always kept this potton where it can't water in this potton
01:45:45.28 --> 01:45:50.40 throw those things they put a bunch of sea rashes in there and stir all that stuff up and you know
01:45:50.40 --> 01:45:57.44 anything takes go with Texas pedaling and so we were all here and all that stuff done and
01:45:58.32 --> 01:46:03.60 and we were by the source sit around I think he had some paper plates or something with him and
01:46:04.16 --> 01:46:08.32 you know you eat with your fingers and all that stuff and we were all kind of sort of
01:46:08.32 --> 01:46:14.48 together around there waiting for major claw to come over and tell us what our you know next missions were
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:26.40 with lost uh we took 10 aircraft up that morning and uh we lost well we lost if if you count
01:46:26.40 --> 01:46:36.32 11 aircraft Colonel Fannanders bird we lost seven um we did have one one gunner hit
01:46:36.32 --> 01:46:45.60 uh but you know purple heart loom but superficial but still he got hit you know that's bad stuff
01:46:46.32 --> 01:46:52.40 but um we're sitting there sort of gathering around and uh all of a sudden we see
01:46:52.40 --> 01:47:02.24 coming toward us figure just tall and laying and and just and I got the glint of the stars on his
01:47:02.24 --> 01:47:11.52 helmet and he got closer to us he just he was the epitome of spit shun boots and it was journal
01:47:11.52 --> 01:47:19.36 Sidbury and he came over and he said uh I just want to tell you comment you're just
01:47:19.36 --> 01:47:28.000 what a great job he did today and uh he said uh I don't want to disturb you child and we said
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:33.44 well sir come on have some childish and know that at your child I grab something to eat up here but
01:47:33.44 --> 01:47:40.32 I just wanted you all to know what a great job he did today and uh with that he said uh girlfriend
01:47:40.32 --> 01:47:46.56 and I'm gonna release you all for the night so we all jumped on the forward-maning aircraft and
01:47:47.36 --> 01:47:56.56 came back to camp eagle there's a section in here in the in the book where um that gets described a
01:47:56.56 --> 01:48:01.92 little bit you're on this flight back to camp eagle and I'm going to the book here it says
01:48:01.92 --> 01:48:07.52 sitting mesmerized on the floor of one of the hewis was captain J. Tate, common chariot two six
01:48:08.56 --> 01:48:15.28 Tate the second flight platoon leader was deep in thought having lost two aircraft this day to end me fire
01:48:16.56 --> 01:48:23.68 the flight was at 6,000 feet flying over a uh flying over a cloud overcast with the sun projecting the
01:48:23.68 --> 01:48:29.68 aircraft shadow on the cloud below them in addition a halo appeared around the shadow he was
01:48:29.68 --> 01:48:34.64 sitting in the doorway behind the right seat pilot with the set of headphones that the crew
01:48:34.64 --> 01:48:40.64 chief had given him wondering to himself why he and his crew had survived this horrendous day
01:48:40.64 --> 01:48:48.08 he heard a voice say to him don't worry J you're gonna be okay he looked up to see who was talking to him
01:48:48.08 --> 01:48:55.20 no one was each passenger was lost in their own thoughts he heard the voice again don't worry J
01:48:56.24 --> 01:49:04.32 you're gonna be okay just then amazing grace played on the armed forces via the non-radio network
01:49:05.92 --> 01:49:11.20 and there's a footnote here that says one week later J received a letter from his mother
01:49:11.20 --> 01:49:18.32 she related a dream she'd have the night before in which J's father had told her don't worry J
01:49:18.96 --> 01:49:23.12 you are going to be okay the letter was dated four March
01:49:23.12 --> 01:49:46.96 J still has the letter touching yeah that's uh that's an amazing amazing story
01:49:46.96 --> 01:49:58.24 emotional uh I watched that shadow where we were actually flying between two layers of clouds
01:50:00.24 --> 01:50:07.52 the sun broke through the upper layer and cast the shadow and of course the heat of the chopper
01:50:07.52 --> 01:50:19.20 the coolness of that altitude for sort of a rainbow effect around that shadow and uh hit the the
01:50:19.20 --> 01:50:25.20 crew chief actually didn't lend me a set of earphones I had my flat helmet on and had it plugged in
01:50:26.24 --> 01:50:33.36 listening to AFVN and because I had been talking about he said there's a major action or major
01:50:33.36 --> 01:50:42.24 war going on up in hot core and he said he said there's been a lot of uh a lot of helicopters
01:50:42.88 --> 01:50:49.04 destroyed and so I want to play this next song for these guys it's one of the
01:50:49.04 --> 01:51:05.36 pretty amazing grace and uh I can tell you as I sit here right now I heard that voice and to get that letter
01:51:07.20 --> 01:51:13.12 and to hear my mom and to hear her read her words that she thought
01:51:13.12 --> 01:51:21.52 dad was telling her don't worry J is going to be okay and she walked my dad up and
01:51:21.52 --> 01:51:26.56 that said oh honey you're dreaming you go back to sleep she said no you said did you tell
01:51:26.56 --> 01:51:32.000 my J is going to be okay you said honey don't worry you don't tell him but there's not a god
01:51:34.88 --> 01:51:38.48 I mean if I pretended to be a Christian at one time but I'll tell you what
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:48.88 that afternoon I became a Christian that's the only way I can say was from off and I
01:51:48.88 --> 01:51:54.08 thought to say those who died weren't because I had prayed God I know I'm going to die just
01:51:54.80 --> 01:52:01.12 don't let me get shot up so bad but my mother won't recognize me and uh I came home
01:52:01.12 --> 01:52:09.12 change person
01:52:11.04 --> 01:52:22.96 well my mother died the she had the same pastor she passed away in 2010 she had relayed that story
01:52:22.96 --> 01:52:28.24 about the dream to her pastor and he had made notes about that that was in his file
01:52:28.24 --> 01:52:32.88 and during her celebration of life service he talked about that
01:52:39.76 --> 01:52:48.16 when you got done when you guys flew back to Camp Eagle did you what did you stand
01:52:48.16 --> 01:52:50.64 down for tonight and then you went back into it
01:52:50.64 --> 01:53:00.64 I fought up skies we're monitoring everything on our company frequency and they had heard all the chaos
01:53:01.92 --> 01:53:13.12 and the horror that was being dealt to us and so of the 10 crew
01:53:13.12 --> 01:53:21.68 we all came back on those four ships because 11 ships if you count
01:53:21.68 --> 01:53:24.16 girlfriend and her ship
01:53:27.68 --> 01:53:34.16 they were all outside waiting for us to come in waiting their hats
01:53:34.16 --> 01:53:42.08 and we all landed and they all ran up and everybody was getting a hug and everybody was
01:53:43.20 --> 01:53:52.72 cold beer was on the on the flatline and and it was just a big celebration and especially because we
01:53:52.72 --> 01:53:59.20 brought help Morrison is crew of Bergen his crew Jerry crews we got them off of there
01:53:59.20 --> 01:54:05.28 and they were sitting on the floor to pull up down and listen to something
01:54:09.92 --> 01:54:18.80 that's the camaraderie and as I told Matt Jackson I said aviation crews are different
01:54:18.80 --> 01:54:29.52 rank is superfluous everybody is has a specific mission crew chief door gunner co-poly
01:54:29.52 --> 01:54:37.28 aircraft commander everybody has a specific mission but nobody can do that one mission by themselves
01:54:37.28 --> 01:54:44.72 it takes all of us working together as a team and I don't care if I'm a captain and you're a
01:54:44.72 --> 01:54:52.24 spec for crew chief I'm no better than you are and if it wasn't for you I can be flying as airplane
01:54:53.28 --> 01:55:01.76 same with the door gun that's a lesson you learn at it you learn a lot about team
01:55:02.48 --> 01:55:08.32 you learn about personal courage you learn about personal responsibility
01:55:08.32 --> 01:55:25.12 you learn a certain sense of tenacity you can't be lazy you you the dedication's got to be there
01:55:26.24 --> 01:55:28.64 and that's what I experienced with these guys and being not
01:55:28.64 --> 01:55:38.72 everyone of them there was no lacquered everyone of them even the guys in the maintenance
01:55:39.52 --> 01:55:44.64 hanger that didn't fly those missions with us and many of them would jump into fly
01:55:44.64 --> 01:55:51.44 mission just to get out there and do it but even to the clerk that wrote the awards
01:55:52.24 --> 01:55:58.32 there was such a sense of dedication and camaraderie that I have never experienced in my
01:55:58.32 --> 01:56:10.88 entire life since then never in my 20 years in uniform and the 13 years that I was fortunate
01:56:10.88 --> 01:56:18.000 to serve as a civilian with the with the office of the secretary defense nothing nothing will ever
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:28.08 compare to what I experienced especially in the Lamson 719 even the Commander
01:56:28.08 --> 01:56:35.84 Control North missions though they were hairy though they had some twist in terms I would have
01:56:35.84 --> 01:56:44.24 never expected and and and what we lost to crew on Commander Control North missions that's horrible
01:56:46.24 --> 01:56:54.72 but nothing compares with Lamson 719 and I think that's that's where the
01:56:54.72 --> 01:57:05.44 what we now see as air salt that's where it was born it was born there we had to think on
01:57:05.44 --> 01:57:12.80 our feet we did things that were written down we had to think on our feet and I mean like coming
01:57:12.80 --> 01:57:16.56 to the ten foot hover versus putting your skids in the ground how do you learn that you learn it
01:57:16.56 --> 01:57:32.48 from experience just just things I guess they're being learned today and more as they teach our
01:57:32.48 --> 01:57:42.16 assault at Fort Campbell today but my god that was I went to reunion at Fort Campbell several years
01:57:42.16 --> 01:57:52.56 back and the guys are all flying black hoax now then they looked at us like we were a war
01:57:52.56 --> 01:58:00.24 or two pilots found between nine with the low tech all this and they were captivated by the
01:58:00.24 --> 01:58:12.32 stories that we could tell you know if it wasn't for GPS I couldn't drive my car from point
01:58:12.32 --> 01:58:18.16 to point B but up in the air I could shoot a vector and I could say pop smoke and identify the smoke
01:58:18.16 --> 01:58:26.80 and you exactly where I was going just things you learn probably one of the words I'm most
01:58:26.80 --> 01:58:34.88 proud of as an army combination metal and I got that from a tank commander we inserted his soldiers
01:58:34.88 --> 01:58:45.52 into the ashaw valley this was after after 719 and it had been a long day for them and
01:58:46.96 --> 01:58:52.80 it was starting to start starting to sit and I get a call from and I something six I
01:58:52.80 --> 01:59:00.80 and I asked the phone he says could you take a one more mission I said we yes our shirts
01:59:00.80 --> 01:59:09.36 sure we can and did call ops because they're expectants he said well I want to treat my troops to ice
01:59:09.36 --> 01:59:18.48 cream and they've got ice cream and Burmaite cans on our long pad back at Eagle I said not a
01:59:18.48 --> 01:59:26.16 problem sir and we flew an ice cream mission in there and he awarded his troops for their hard work
01:59:28.40 --> 01:59:41.12 and I got an article for that I bet you that ice cream tastes good yeah yeah and
01:59:41.12 --> 01:59:49.20 after that I went with landing in LZ many times I'd get out of the cockpit
01:59:50.80 --> 01:59:55.52 always wore spit shum boots I always dress right dressed ready front the whole time always
01:59:55.52 --> 02:00:01.36 wore spit shum boots but I'm later to my goal I was going to get out of that damn cockpit
02:00:02.72 --> 02:00:09.76 and I say okay Peter Polly you got it copilot and I'd help the troops unload supplies off the
02:00:09.76 --> 02:00:19.28 ship and I I want to thank they appreciate that here's a aviation captain getting out of the
02:00:19.28 --> 02:00:31.52 cockpit and he's doing sweatwork that's what I learned in Vietnam we had a of and just an
02:00:31.52 --> 02:00:36.88 unbelievable relationship with the hundred first in the battle of Ramadi the the first the 506 was
02:00:36.88 --> 02:00:46.24 there and I could never say enough good things about their leadership and the soldiers on the ground
02:00:46.80 --> 02:01:00.72 the fighting that they did it was just amazing amazing courage and one of my guys making on
02:01:00.72 --> 02:01:08.08 so we were was killed doing a mission supporting them and when we got home we were now and
02:01:08.72 --> 02:01:13.36 on their wall where they have the list of the soldiers that they lost in the battle of
02:01:13.36 --> 02:01:28.16 Ramadi they have my keys name up there with them I think we're fortunate Jacke we're fortunate
02:01:28.16 --> 02:01:33.36 that when you people like that and there will be people who will go to their graves
02:01:34.08 --> 02:01:40.80 that never experience that kind of heros and that kind of commitment that kind of courage
02:01:42.32 --> 02:01:49.12 that kind of teamwork the camaraderie will never ever experience it and I think you're an
02:01:49.12 --> 02:02:00.08 irv- fortunate that we've had that opportunity indeed wouldn't trade it for the world
02:02:02.80 --> 02:02:09.92 what going back to to to Lamson once you had that would did they give you a night of
02:02:09.92 --> 02:02:17.28 rest and then you started flying missions again I had two days down and then started flying
02:02:17.28 --> 02:02:25.20 again it was after that that during the race applause when I think the arv-in knew that
02:02:27.28 --> 02:02:31.84 the NVA had a hell a lot more confidence in her ability than the arv-in did
02:02:34.64 --> 02:02:42.48 it was after that during doing those race supply missions in there that that I actually experienced
02:02:42.48 --> 02:02:49.76 them abandoning the battle space I didn't experience that before Lamson 719
02:02:51.68 --> 02:02:56.000 always thought it was interesting when we would we're going to a PZ
02:02:57.44 --> 02:03:03.04 early morning put put the chopper down waiting for them to load up the arv-in the
02:03:03.04 --> 02:03:10.48 self it means load up but I'd see them sitting there and they had water in their still pots and they were
02:03:10.48 --> 02:03:16.08 brushing their teeth and it was like this is extremely important that I brushed my teeth and
02:03:16.08 --> 02:03:22.32 all I saw well that's kind of interesting that they're doing that personal hygiene
02:03:23.60 --> 02:03:29.04 and they're going pour the water out put their helmet liners back in put their helmets
02:03:29.04 --> 02:03:34.24 under going clamol board this aircraft and god knows what faces them when they hit the OZ
02:03:34.24 --> 02:03:46.88 but they made sure that their teeth were clean as this goes on like you said the tide started to turn
02:03:46.88 --> 02:03:55.52 and I think the goal became just to get to how'd you say chippony is that how they said
02:03:55.52 --> 02:04:04.96 chippony the goal is to get there they kind of got there like almost like playing tag touched it yeah
02:04:04.96 --> 02:04:11.36 we made it and then said let's get out of here and by the way there was hardly anything there about this
02:04:11.36 --> 02:04:23.44 then and then as the arv-in started to retreat then the NVA stepped up the attacks even more
02:04:23.44 --> 02:04:38.48 and it just slaughtered yeah and that's where I picked up the body bags with the dead arv and soldiers in him
02:04:41.60 --> 02:04:48.88 turns into a bit of a route as the as the arv-in are now leaving you know there's
02:04:48.88 --> 02:04:59.84 again I mean I'm just a couple days here March 21st the NVA the North Vietnamese attack
02:04:59.84 --> 02:05:06.16 their division attacks a second and third battians US Air support during the day included 788
02:05:06.16 --> 02:05:15.36 helo gunships or these 157 tag clear strikes and 11b 52 strikes fast forward another day
02:05:15.36 --> 02:05:26.96 March 23rd 756 helo gunships or these 238 tag clear strikes 11b 52 strikes
02:05:28.16 --> 02:05:33.52 this is as they're kind of getting back to the border into south Vietnam right
02:05:35.76 --> 02:05:43.04 March 25 finally 45 days after the start of the operation all the south Vietnamese forces are out of
02:05:43.04 --> 02:05:52.16 louss and well so to speak yeah yeah strikers yeah I guess the ones that they are accounting for
02:05:52.16 --> 02:06:03.60 our back April 6th the basic case on is under attack and it gets abandoned
02:06:06.32 --> 02:06:12.000 and to your point earlier on April 7th so that's April 6th the operation is over
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000 the case on is abandoned April 7th President Nixon declares tonight I can report that
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.96 Vietnam's realization has succeeded and announces the further withdraw 100,000 more troops
02:06:28.16 --> 02:06:36.16 friendly losses during this operation 7 fixed wing planes 108 helocopters lost
02:06:36.16 --> 02:06:44.80 618 helocopters damaged 20% beyond repair 32 artillery pieces captured and these are south
02:06:44.80 --> 02:06:53.04 Vietnamese artillery pieces south Vietnamese tank 71 of them south Vietnamese armored vehicles 163 of them 37
02:06:53.04 --> 02:07:02.24 half trucks 278 trucks destroyed south Vietnamese loss and I couldn't really come up with a great
02:07:02.24 --> 02:07:09.92 number on this but it's between 5,000 and 15,000 men killed wounded or missing depending on the
02:07:09.92 --> 02:07:30.96 source that you go to Americans 149 wounded 38 missing an action 215 killed an action
02:07:30.96 --> 02:07:45.20 you know that's the second time we left case on we left it in 68 after the Marines got over run
02:07:48.24 --> 02:07:54.32 and here we go again and you often hear combat soldiers say we fault hard we lost
02:07:54.32 --> 02:07:59.04 guys in our unit to take that hill and next we took it we left it now we have to go back and take it
02:07:59.04 --> 02:08:15.20 again there it is when so now this operations over I mean did did attitude start to change
02:08:15.20 --> 02:08:20.40 you're here in Nixon saying that Vietnamization is working and you see the you see the south
02:08:20.40 --> 02:08:28.72 Vietnamese fleeing the battlefield what was the what was the attitude of you all in my unit and
02:08:28.72 --> 02:08:39.28 that's all I can speak for the a spread of core never never ceased we were still flying
02:08:39.28 --> 02:08:50.16 command and control north supporting those guys and their mission grew even more critical
02:08:50.16 --> 02:08:56.88 because they were there judging okay now the lamb sombs over what what's the
02:08:56.88 --> 02:09:04.000 pavement the north fit in the knees army doing now where are they you know it was during that time
02:09:05.28 --> 02:09:13.84 shortly after I left they over ran quantry dung ha heavens certainly within their site camp
02:09:13.84 --> 02:09:27.28 heavens which was north of campy go the hunt and furt head quarters but I never saw any sense of
02:09:27.44 --> 02:09:34.24 behavior they said okay well seven seven one nine's over I guess the wars over I never saw that
02:09:34.24 --> 02:09:43.36 attitude our soldiers remain very professional soldiers that's amazing cause many
02:09:43.36 --> 02:09:49.76 on were just nineteen years old some bomber eighteen I had worn off sort of a twenty one
02:09:51.04 --> 02:10:06.08 I'm out with an old dude I was twenty five I never never once questioned our our ability
02:10:06.08 --> 02:10:13.60 as an aviation unit to do the job the mission that we were assigned to do even after even
02:10:13.60 --> 02:10:18.56 up until the day I left when I became the operations officer my last four months in country
02:10:18.56 --> 02:10:23.44 I got a chance to look at at the battle space in a different way because I would go to
02:10:23.44 --> 02:10:30.16 batayan and batayan ops and look at that then come back and put that into company ops and and
02:10:30.16 --> 02:10:38.64 work our portion of the mission our company's portion of the batayan mission and
02:10:40.32 --> 02:10:43.76 I'd bring the guys into the briefing room the guys are gonna be flying that mission
02:10:45.04 --> 02:10:53.36 and I'd say okay this is our objective right here now how do we get there we're here
02:10:53.36 --> 02:10:59.68 this is our objective our mission is this we got to put so many troops in there how do we get
02:11:00.80 --> 02:11:06.32 and usually it was it just one place it was if it was a company plus it would be maybe three different
02:11:06.32 --> 02:11:12.000 places we'd have to go and I never would say okay this is how we're going to do it you're
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:19.76 gonna do I say how do we get there what what's the best approach to make this happen and I was
02:11:19.76 --> 02:11:24.96 the operational and I'd have these young one officers oh let's do this to do it and somebody's
02:11:24.96 --> 02:11:29.12 not an advocate that we're gonna do this so I said well let's do it this way well okay well
02:11:29.12 --> 02:11:36.72 let's take a piece of that next thing you know they had planned the operation all I did was
02:11:36.72 --> 02:11:49.12 approve it but that that's a leadership skill that I learned from people like Colonel Bobby
02:11:49.12 --> 02:11:57.12 Fernando who never said you're gonna do it this way he always sort of facilitated if you
02:11:57.12 --> 02:12:02.32 will facilitated leadership and that's what you're seeing now in business facilitated
02:12:02.32 --> 02:12:08.16 leadership getting people involved and if the more you involve the more you take ownership
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:14.48 and that's what I saw in our guys that's what I saw in our guys
02:12:15.36 --> 02:12:19.36 during the lambson that's what I saw in our guys after lambson
02:12:20.64 --> 02:12:25.12 now we were a fine commander to troll north we did what they told us to
02:12:25.12 --> 02:12:32.16 they had a very specific way of doing things and that's the way we're gonna do it
02:12:32.16 --> 02:12:41.52 and that's fine and that's fine but this is the way we did it and I mirrored my
02:12:42.64 --> 02:12:46.08 leadership style after people that I had great respect for
02:12:46.08 --> 02:12:55.60 to include General Hellmore became Lieutenant General Hellmore and the way that the
02:12:55.60 --> 02:13:00.80 Comerada the the sub not Comerada I don't want to say I was buddy buddy but General
02:13:00.80 --> 02:13:05.76 Moore because I was not but we had a we had a relationship in the cockpit and I think he
02:13:05.76 --> 02:13:11.44 respected my desires what I wanted to obviously did because I went to go to nom had an odd
02:13:11.44 --> 02:13:16.16 man for that yeah I don't know if you didn't have a relationship with Hal Moore but
02:13:16.16 --> 02:13:20.08 Jesus if you were friends with him who knows what he would have done for you
02:13:20.56 --> 02:13:26.16 what a great man he was but but I left I left vet nom filling very good about
02:13:27.36 --> 02:13:36.72 my unit and about what we did I did change my views a bit to think that
02:13:36.72 --> 02:13:46.000 my tour and nom will be successful if I can do things to support my US troops
02:13:47.92 --> 02:13:51.76 so that change from supporting the whole concept of vitanization
02:13:53.76 --> 02:13:58.88 for example if I can bring ice cream out to those troops after they busted their butt all day
02:13:58.88 --> 02:14:09.04 inserting then I've done something that I can be proud of and that's where my
02:14:09.04 --> 02:14:15.68 mind sort of changed after being in country for about eight months to support my
02:14:15.68 --> 02:14:24.72 soldiers and to do what I could to bring them home yeah the leadership stuff
02:14:24.72 --> 02:14:29.52 you're talking about that's exactly the the best leaders I had was they would tell us
02:14:29.52 --> 02:14:33.84 what the mission was what the goal was and then say come up with a plan and that's what I always
02:14:33.84 --> 02:14:39.68 tried to do myself that's certainly is the the best way to get the people on board with the
02:14:39.68 --> 02:14:43.52 plan is just let them come up with it that's right don't have to convince them of anything
02:14:43.52 --> 02:14:50.72 that it's their idea it's their plan let them argue it out yeah yep so when you did uh
02:14:50.72 --> 02:15:05.36 so what what when when did you leave you now it was in October of 71 and uh
02:15:05.36 --> 02:15:12.88 and nom there was four officers that lived in the same hooch um well I had our little private
02:15:12.88 --> 02:15:18.40 rooms at the corner of this rectangle or hooch then the center was a common area and we had a
02:15:18.40 --> 02:15:26.80 little stove in the common area and so on but um right across for me was an officer a stand dodge
02:15:27.76 --> 02:15:35.04 he was coming to her one eight and so when we would fly when I knew he was flying a go
02:15:35.04 --> 02:15:42.56 being an air then hot he and I would choose a frequency that we would come up on just and
02:15:42.56 --> 02:15:47.12 would fly follow with each other near so let's sort of look in after each other you know in the air
02:15:47.12 --> 02:15:55.52 so I came back from from nom it's very interesting story uh there was me as a common chair
02:15:56.32 --> 02:16:00.64 and then there were three other pilots who were kings my neighbor and bravo company
02:16:00.64 --> 02:16:07.76 101st aviation which was our sister company and uh we all knew each other and we all came back we were
02:16:07.76 --> 02:16:12.88 in our cackies where in our flight jackets and you know we thought our Sierra didn't stink
02:16:12.88 --> 02:16:21.04 and we get back into Seattle Tacoma and uh got walt through the airport nobody's
02:16:21.04 --> 02:16:28.32 spitting on us nobody yelling at us nobody called us baby killers and we got a taxi we come into
02:16:29.44 --> 02:16:34.72 and we say hey uh is there a holiday any says yeah there's one downtown so he takes us to the holiday
02:16:34.72 --> 02:16:42.16 and we all check in our rooms we clean up we come down to the bar to meet before we go
02:16:42.16 --> 02:16:47.12 have some dinner we get to the bar of course we're all you know we're all got flight pay they
02:16:47.12 --> 02:16:52.48 paid us before we leave nom you know we're all loaded with money more than we should have had
02:16:53.44 --> 02:16:58.80 and we get into the bar and bartenders are what big guys and go to wherever flight jackets on
02:16:58.80 --> 02:17:04.80 you know and they were feeling kind of smuggled and we all ordered drinks and
02:17:04.80 --> 02:17:12.48 one of them said hey everybody else is drink their next drink it's own all of it's own us
02:17:13.12 --> 02:17:18.80 so we all threw in money we bought everybody in the bar that was sitting there their next drink
02:17:18.80 --> 02:17:26.48 and there was a couple he was playing piano and she was singing and uh they were like the
02:17:27.36 --> 02:17:32.64 what's that the carpenters okay that's and she was singing they were doing all the
02:17:32.64 --> 02:17:39.84 carpenters on and so she dedicated a special song she says he says exclamation gentlemen
02:17:39.84 --> 02:17:45.92 but the next drink that all of y'all will get tonight are from these four guys standing at the
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:52.32 bar in uniform they all just returned from Vietnam and let's give them around to applause now
02:17:52.32 --> 02:17:58.88 stood up give us a round of applause and then she said I'm going to dedicate this next song
02:17:58.88 --> 02:18:07.04 to these guys and it was very special and we didn't buy another drink that night
02:18:08.80 --> 02:18:16.08 we all had stakes they were all paid for and it they quit playing at one o'clock
02:18:16.80 --> 02:18:21.36 and this guy came up to us and said hey we're a bunch of us are here on an insurance convention
02:18:22.24 --> 02:18:28.24 we'd like to take y'all out for breakfast so they took us out to breakfast and we all got to bed
02:18:28.24 --> 02:18:35.28 about five o'clock in the morning and then we all flew out our separate ways the next day
02:18:35.28 --> 02:18:44.000 but it was telling you about stand dodge standing parents lived in Arizona to sign and
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:51.60 he said and he had left country about a month before I did so he said I want to have a little
02:18:51.60 --> 02:18:58.48 together in my house if you don't mind staying over one day before you make it back so I flew into
02:18:58.48 --> 02:19:05.92 Tucson and he had a couple don't at dollars there who were in the hundred and first
02:19:07.52 --> 02:19:12.000 they were there in fact stand married one of the don't at dollars barber
02:19:13.68 --> 02:19:21.20 and Terry Digan was a friend of mine she was there and plus one guy from bravo company
02:19:21.20 --> 02:19:27.76 the Kingsman and and another pilot but we partied hearty that night and stand
02:19:27.76 --> 02:19:35.36 parents just did a wonderful job of making us feel at home and so on and might have been there
02:19:35.36 --> 02:19:39.68 two nights I stayed because I had to have time to get my uniform cleaned up for a
02:19:39.68 --> 02:19:46.96 warm home I wanted to make sure it was strapped when my parents saw me and so I got my uniform
02:19:46.96 --> 02:19:54.24 got my shoes all spit shot everything caught the plane out of Phoenix and Terry was with me and
02:19:54.24 --> 02:20:00.64 Terry and I had a really nice relationship I mean it wasn't a sexual thing it was just a nice
02:20:00.64 --> 02:20:06.96 relationship we understood each other and she had left none two months before I did and she
02:20:06.96 --> 02:20:11.92 would write me letters telling me about how the world back in the States was not the world it
02:20:11.92 --> 02:20:19.12 was not the real world world world her what she experienced in Vietnam with the soldier
02:20:19.12 --> 02:20:25.84 and that was the real world you know we we would write back a fourth about that and uh
02:20:25.84 --> 02:20:34.56 I flew my flight took us to Shivas from Downers Grove Illinois so we flew to Chicago and then
02:20:34.56 --> 02:20:41.20 obviously catch a plane for Chicago to Charlotte and she wanted me to meet her parents and
02:20:42.64 --> 02:20:48.96 and I wanted to meet her parents too and now I could have probably had a relationship with Terry
02:20:48.96 --> 02:20:54.64 that would have gone beyond she ended up marrying an army ranger a several years later that she
02:20:54.64 --> 02:21:00.80 had known and not but uh kept waiting for her parents to come and my flight was coming up to go
02:21:00.80 --> 02:21:05.36 in a parent's handshot up yet and I never did get to be to parents we finally gave a hug and
02:21:05.36 --> 02:21:10.32 kiss goodbye and I got on the plane and flew to Charlotte and that's where my parents met me
02:21:12.08 --> 02:21:18.88 but I think having those couple days to it's a decompress before I got home
02:21:19.60 --> 02:21:26.16 it's probably psychologically good for me yeah that's uh one thing they always point out world
02:21:26.16 --> 02:21:31.68 were two the guys when the world was over they got on ships and sailed home together for four
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:35.52 weeks or six weeks and they got to decompress and tell stories and get stuff off their chest and
02:21:35.52 --> 02:21:40.16 whatever and in Vietnam it was like oh you're in Vietnam today and then the next day you're home
02:21:40.16 --> 02:21:45.28 and you don't have your friends with you and you're in random you know main town USA or mainstream
02:21:45.28 --> 02:21:53.76 USA and that that can be a challenge so let's fast forward uh I was home 30 days reassigned
02:21:53.76 --> 02:22:02.24 to Fort Dickson, New Jersey um not an aviation uh I was actually working for a facility that
02:22:03.12 --> 02:22:10.48 processed a wall and disorder soldiers that were brought back into the army but every Friday night
02:22:10.48 --> 02:22:15.84 all the aviators they go home take off their fatigues put on their flat suits
02:22:15.84 --> 02:22:22.08 but all gathered around in one little portion of the offshore club bar and would sit there and
02:22:22.08 --> 02:22:30.24 we had reminisce and tell war stories and and it got emotional at times it which
02:22:30.24 --> 02:22:35.92 might come on to buy alcohol by another beer you know but that's a part of the decompression
02:22:35.92 --> 02:22:43.12 and that those were very special times to sit there and talk about that and people have often asked
02:22:43.12 --> 02:22:48.56 me what what kind of problems did you have and I said well really didn't have any problems
02:22:48.56 --> 02:22:54.72 when I came back and and they you know well you must have been tough I said what I wasn't tough
02:22:54.72 --> 02:22:59.28 I said I think it's just the process of what how we all would get together and talk about our
02:22:59.28 --> 02:23:05.36 experiences and I said these guys that came back from nom after being in combat especially
02:23:05.36 --> 02:23:11.20 infantry guys grunts as we call them uh they would come back they go to Fort Lewis their
02:23:11.20 --> 02:23:15.76 process of the army then they'd go home and they didn't have an opportunity to sit around and
02:23:15.76 --> 02:23:22.16 many of those were subjected to some very harsh treatments when they when they arrived home and I never
02:23:22.16 --> 02:23:29.76 had fortunately never had that experience so I think the army's learning a lot of that all the
02:23:29.76 --> 02:23:34.64 services are learning a lot about that about how do we take care of our veterans after they've been
02:23:34.64 --> 02:23:45.44 I mean you were in hell of a lot of horrific situations that that could have mentally
02:23:45.44 --> 02:23:51.12 had a horrible impact on you but you've worked through that yourself Joke.
02:23:52.80 --> 02:23:57.28 Yeah I mean I think I always talk about the fact that I've talked about it,
02:23:57.28 --> 02:24:02.000 written about it, talk to my friends about it and I think that's like you said it's what you're
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:07.84 kind of got to do and you know the I look back now in the first the from my last deployment for
02:24:07.84 --> 02:24:18.16 to Ramadi we got home and we were pretty yeah what's a good word here we were pretty wild when we
02:24:18.16 --> 02:24:24.96 got back we were pretty wild when we got back and but you know we kept it under you know we kept we
02:24:24.96 --> 02:24:29.84 looked out for each other make sure that we were wild without you know doing anything that's going
02:24:29.84 --> 02:24:35.36 to cause a reprobable damage or cause some kind of major significant problem but we were definitely
02:24:35.36 --> 02:24:40.08 wild I mean they're no doubt about it and then you know I don't know if it was maybe six months maybe
02:24:40.08 --> 02:24:44.08 a year or something like that you know we started getting back to kind of just doing what we were
02:24:44.08 --> 02:24:47.68 doing a little bit more normal but yeah we were we're pretty wild when we got back.
02:24:48.88 --> 02:24:57.84 Well you know if my excuse was I was you got pretty drunk last night so well I'm an
02:24:57.84 --> 02:25:04.48 heavier yeah yeah we had some you know we all kind a bunch of us lived in the kind of the same area
02:25:04.48 --> 02:25:11.68 too same little neighborhood and so yeah we would go out we'd meet up and we'd go we'd go pretty hard.
02:25:12.72 --> 02:25:19.84 I think I think for me I'm still it's amazing the older I get now and I'll be 76 and all
02:25:19.84 --> 02:25:36.96 this the memories become more vivid now I dream about this more I'm hearing from people we have a
02:25:36.96 --> 02:25:46.08 we have our own common chiro website and you can tell by the comments that Lampson 719
02:25:46.08 --> 02:25:55.28 had a major major psychological impact on our guys and there were some guys that measured
02:25:55.28 --> 02:26:02.72 their time in service oh I was I came after 719 or I left just before 719 so they say that
02:26:02.72 --> 02:26:14.08 some of them came an anchor to describe where one was at one's time flying with the common cherries
02:26:17.60 --> 02:26:26.000 and when when Matt called me up and asked me what I do some collaboration on this book
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:36.24 in some ways I was pleased in some ways I was a little frightened to bring up
02:26:38.96 --> 02:26:43.12 the experiences and I'll be perfectly honest I had a lot of anxiety coming here today
02:26:43.12 --> 02:26:55.92 though I read this book and a number of times read undolented valor 719 quite a few times I've
02:26:55.92 --> 02:27:06.08 air marked it I've read after action reports on it that hopefully Matt had any did yet some
02:27:06.08 --> 02:27:16.64 of these after action reports that he took his data from but still sitting here now and talking
02:27:16.64 --> 02:27:25.84 about it with you and you weren't there I can talk about it with somebody it was there and but
02:27:25.84 --> 02:27:33.28 and not have anxiety but you weren't there and often wonder I'm telling you this
02:27:33.28 --> 02:27:41.12 but what are you actually hearing because you weren't there and you can tell me about what you did
02:27:42.64 --> 02:27:51.04 and I can listen to it but I wasn't there and so there's a difference yeah there's there's always
02:27:51.04 --> 02:27:56.24 going to be a little gap or a big gap depending on you know the person's experiences and
02:27:57.20 --> 02:28:02.40 you know one thing I think is interesting about you know we start talking about coming home
02:28:02.40 --> 02:28:09.68 and what you're going through I think the one thing that's good is if people actually understand
02:28:09.68 --> 02:28:14.88 what they're feeling a little bit and I remember like you get a new guy that's overseas
02:28:15.60 --> 02:28:20.48 and I look at a new guy that's overseas and you could tell the nervous right and you know
02:28:20.48 --> 02:28:25.20 to say something like hey man you know you that feeling you get in your stomach and maybe like
02:28:25.20 --> 02:28:29.60 you know trying not to tell you but then they admit to it and I go yeah you're just an
02:28:29.60 --> 02:28:34.16 nervous it's your that your body getting ready to go fight it's totally normal that's where you
02:28:34.16 --> 02:28:39.28 should feel like and they'd be okay oh you oh by the way you won't be able to sleep tonight because
02:28:39.28 --> 02:28:42.48 we got a operation tomorrow you're not going to be able to sleep tonight so that's just the way
02:28:42.48 --> 02:28:47.36 it is don't worry about it and I think the same thing coming home you know it's like oh oh you're
02:28:47.36 --> 02:28:50.96 going to get you're going to get sad sometimes it doesn't mean your week it doesn't mean your
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.04 trapped in the past it just means you miss your friends and that's okay and so if you are thinking
02:28:57.04 --> 02:29:02.80 about something and it makes you cry hey yeah that's what that's what happens you know that's the
02:29:02.80 --> 02:29:10.40 way it is and I think if people understand that that's that's that's normal then they're okay well
02:29:10.40 --> 02:29:15.60 that's that's just what's gonna happen it's okay and I think when people don't think it's normal
02:29:15.60 --> 02:29:20.16 and all of a sudden they think I can't control my emotions or I'm scared or I'm sad and I shouldn't
02:29:20.16 --> 02:29:24.64 be sad and I shouldn't be scared it's like no it's it's time no big deal that's the way it is you
02:29:24.64 --> 02:29:29.76 you do your job you you know you're going to be scared you got the you got the crazy stomach you
02:29:29.76 --> 02:29:34.000 can't sleep at night okay cool yeah guess what there's a bunch of other guys that's not sleeping
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:39.20 tonight either no big deal no big deal oh you get home you you're going to feel sad you're going to
02:29:39.20 --> 02:29:45.28 miss your friends yeah we all miss them that that's the way it is that that's okay and I think that
02:29:45.28 --> 02:29:52.96 helps people out a lot to be able to just say okay what I'm feeling is not an isolated thing
02:29:52.96 --> 02:29:58.64 it's just the way human beings process the the tough experiences that they go through
02:29:59.20 --> 02:30:07.68 but you know we we both served in the kind of service that at one time you didn't show that
02:30:07.68 --> 02:30:16.08 emotion yeah and you weren't expected to I think the service and I hope I've read that they have
02:30:16.08 --> 02:30:23.84 I've seen interviews that they have that now that's been taking consideration it's okay to express
02:30:24.48 --> 02:30:29.76 what you're feeling right now it's okay to go seek counseling because it's not going to end
02:30:29.76 --> 02:30:35.12 up on your Austria-Festival report or your annual report or whatever reports you're going to get
02:30:37.52 --> 02:30:44.40 and so I think that has been a great improvement with the way we receive
02:30:44.40 --> 02:30:52.88 our war fighting men and women especially those who have come back and been engaged in combat
02:30:54.96 --> 02:31:01.76 one thing I'll say about the getting excited and nervous about the upcoming mission
02:31:03.84 --> 02:31:07.84 and I would do the same thing of Vietnam I mean people said were you scared said well how
02:31:07.84 --> 02:31:13.04 yeah I'm scared but hey you know this is what we signed up to do and this is what we're going
02:31:13.04 --> 02:31:21.60 to do and a lot of times I mean I'd said that trying to convince myself but see I was a
02:31:21.60 --> 02:31:25.60 Paton commander I can sit there and tell my trips oh my god I'm scared death are good
02:31:25.60 --> 02:31:33.68 ah I had to put on the show I had to do that but the interesting thing about it is once we
02:31:33.68 --> 02:31:42.16 strapped on that helicopter and we took off in flight all of that right it all right I mean
02:31:42.16 --> 02:31:48.40 it never amazed me got a job to do well yeah I mean you were busy you were monitoring
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:54.000 through your adios you were you know talking to the crew there I mean it all drained I mean
02:31:54.56 --> 02:31:59.60 even going into even going into the lowlands that that morning when we were doing non-in-offs
02:31:59.60 --> 02:32:05.28 approach and we should have been done 60 or 40 and we were coming in there and but you
02:32:05.28 --> 02:32:08.80 soccer that thing back in that damn nose pigeon's up and you're saying oh hell I hope my
02:32:08.80 --> 02:32:13.44 tail rotor done hit the ground and then you put that sucker down and you're taking fire all the
02:32:13.44 --> 02:32:23.52 place you don't have time to be scared you you you react by the training that you've had
02:32:23.52 --> 02:32:29.92 and by God that training was good yeah yeah exactly and that's I think the same way everybody
02:32:29.92 --> 02:32:34.32 feels I mean if you're going to be nervous it's usually before an operation and for me I was
02:32:34.32 --> 02:32:38.56 always just more nervous about my my friends my guys that's what I was always worried about
02:32:38.56 --> 02:32:44.32 hey I hope nothing happens to the guys you know but then once for us it's once the breach goes you
02:32:44.32 --> 02:32:48.80 know what once the breach goes now it's on everybody knows we're here we're doing what we're doing
02:32:48.80 --> 02:32:52.64 you know once we leave the magate front gate you're you're doing your job and there's
02:32:53.84 --> 02:32:59.52 no time to think about that you can't you can't waste any mental capacity thinking about what
02:32:59.52 --> 02:33:02.96 could happen or what might go happen because you got to do your job and you don't want to
02:33:02.96 --> 02:33:07.36 have anything else in your head besides hey what do I need to do right now how can I do my best
02:33:07.36 --> 02:33:15.28 job right now that's what I'm thinking about but again I seen some nervous new guys and just
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:21.04 hey man it's all right no big deal and and I think that helps people a lot just like anything anytime
02:33:21.04 --> 02:33:25.76 you can give somebody a heads up about what's about to happen or what I've had this feeling with
02:33:25.76 --> 02:33:31.36 the training MMA fighters mix martial arts fighters to go and fight and I saw the exact same thing
02:33:31.36 --> 02:33:35.20 this is kind of where I started putting it together oh I tell them hey oh you're stomach a little
02:33:35.20 --> 02:33:38.80 crazy yeah I'm super nervous yeah you're supposed to be you're getting ready going to a fight
02:33:38.80 --> 02:33:43.12 yeah it's okay and that would put them at ease because they'd realize oh this is just normal
02:33:43.12 --> 02:33:47.12 this is just me getting ready going to you know that form of sporting combat
02:33:49.36 --> 02:33:54.000 I think but but but add to that I think it's good to be a little nervous for sure
02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:03.52 because you're more own your game for sure and and that's one thing that's one thing general
02:34:03.52 --> 02:34:11.52 John Amar's told me he was a mentor of mine and later on in my service and he was one that
02:34:11.52 --> 02:34:18.08 actually encouraged me to take the civilian position with the sick death because I was doing a
02:34:18.08 --> 02:34:24.72 strategic planning work for him after I had retired from the uniform service and we had this
02:34:25.52 --> 02:34:32.08 we had this big strategic planning conference coming up and I said sir I'd like to bring
02:34:32.08 --> 02:34:39.04 doctor so and so we're in from George Washington University he's been he's been a big critical
02:34:39.04 --> 02:34:46.24 thinker he sort of plans okay this is where we have to be how do we get there kind of a thing
02:34:46.24 --> 02:34:51.76 because we were doing strategic planning yeah the vision is where you want to be now how do we
02:34:51.76 --> 02:34:59.20 go for where we are today to make it vision or reality and he said I don't even work for me
02:34:59.20 --> 02:35:08.56 I said but two years sir he said do you have a PhD I said no sir's master's degree
02:35:09.68 --> 02:35:21.20 he said well I trust you I don't know this guy and that's that's a leadership style that
02:35:21.20 --> 02:35:30.48 that breeds confidence and your soldiers and your employees I got confidence in you I don't know
02:35:30.48 --> 02:35:40.64 this guy so doctor what's his name I never heard him come in to do some work for us but that may be
02:35:40.64 --> 02:35:47.04 feel great yeah so how much longer did you do in the honor me before you retired? I was last
02:35:47.04 --> 02:35:58.24 but 20 years in uniform 68 88 then I immediately before that general Mars it was talking to me about
02:35:58.24 --> 02:36:03.60 he said you're never going to make Colonel God Branch transferred from infantry to the
02:36:03.60 --> 02:36:11.92 armies as an general corps which is a administrative corps you are me and he said I want you to take
02:36:11.92 --> 02:36:19.20 this job the second half has been impressed with work he been doing and said your office will be
02:36:19.20 --> 02:36:23.60 here with me but you'll be working out of the office of the second half and at that time
02:36:23.60 --> 02:36:28.48 us with the defense communications agency which became now the defense information assistance
02:36:28.48 --> 02:36:33.60 agency but my office was there I had clients all military clients all over it was just
02:36:33.60 --> 02:36:43.60 communications guys underseek death was one of my clients the sink US Atlantic command general

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:58.96 warrior great leader general Mike Stale who commanded US Army Pacific just to tremendous
02:36:58.96 --> 02:37:02.80 guy the underseeker the offensive logistics I got a chest to do strategic planning work for him
02:37:03.52 --> 02:37:10.72 quite a few organizations in NATO two organizations at shape and that's that's all because
02:37:10.72 --> 02:37:17.60 of a guy my name is John Mars that supported me and paid the way for me and he believed in me
02:37:18.32 --> 02:37:26.24 and though I had a didn't have a PhD he trusted me is that that what leaders are for me
02:37:26.24 --> 02:37:34.08 indeed and then how long did you how long did you do that for 13 years and then you
02:37:34.96 --> 02:37:41.84 went on full retirement not quite well then I was offered a position in the in civilian career
02:37:41.84 --> 02:37:49.60 in the steel business and I was executive vice president of a steel center
02:37:49.60 --> 02:37:57.52 stayed there from O1 to O9 thought I'd retire went into the insurance business for a
02:37:57.52 --> 02:38:11.52 little bit was it exciting then I decided to retire and now my fiance is still working she represents

02:39:00.80 --> 02:39:06.64 has nothing to share to do that's beautiful thing a little vacation day for a little vacation day
02:39:07.44 --> 02:39:12.80 they before we stop I know there's a couple things that just to mention here what can you give us the
02:39:12.80 --> 02:39:19.36 update I know that I know that Colonel Jackson's been working day to sort of turn this into a movie
02:39:19.68 --> 02:39:25.60 turn at least some of these books into a movie I know there's a go fund me page out there what
02:39:25.60 --> 02:39:34.32 what's the update on on on these opportunities okay well yes as people should probably know
02:39:34.32 --> 02:39:43.76 that takes a lot of money to produce a movie however a undone to the valor lamisson 719 is going to
02:39:43.76 --> 02:39:52.16 be the movie and it's our story of those of us who flew in it who supported it we need to have
02:39:52.16 --> 02:40:00.32 this on the big screen and as Colonel Jackson's desire as well as as mine that this not become
02:40:00.32 --> 02:40:07.52 Hollywood flash in the pan maybe this is going to be an action film movie because lamisson 719 was
02:40:07.52 --> 02:40:14.80 action and he wants the movie to depict what actually happened and if anyone reads the book they
02:40:14.80 --> 02:40:19.76 will know that if the movie depicts a quarter of what's in that book it is going to be on the
02:40:19.76 --> 02:40:25.20 edge of your seat kind of a movie so the events and everything that he's put into the saying
02:40:25.20 --> 02:40:30.88 we're not Hollywood made up events these are true events he's changed some names but these are true events
02:40:33.28 --> 02:40:40.72 he does have several actors who have indicated that they have liked to play major roles in the
02:40:40.72 --> 02:40:47.12 movie there's already a producer on board and the screen rotters are busy writing this but it
02:40:47.12 --> 02:40:54.48 takes money to do this and the go fund me undone to the valor is the place where people who here
02:40:54.48 --> 02:41:00.96 this and feel that they won't this story told whether it's them themselves or their relatives who
02:41:00.96 --> 02:41:08.000 are involved in this or they are just very supportive of what our military has done in the past
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:13.84 especially what we did in Vietnam which a lot of those stories were not very favorable stories
02:41:14.56 --> 02:41:22.000 this is a very favorable story what we did the nine courage them to do the go fund me undone to valor
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:33.60 all this money is going to being accepted by a 501c3 group at Fort Campbell Kentucky
02:41:35.20 --> 02:41:40.08 and so Matt gets another this money Matt Jackson gets another this money it's all going towards
02:41:41.04 --> 02:41:49.04 this movie every last set off it's going towards this movie so the quicker we can get this
02:41:49.04 --> 02:41:55.28 and the more we can faster we can proceed with development this movie and obviously encourage
02:41:56.24 --> 02:42:00.88 people to take this into consideration 501c3 so your go nation is tax deductible
02:42:01.44 --> 02:42:06.88 that's outstanding and and I look forward to I look forward to seeing this thing for sure when it
02:42:06.88 --> 02:42:11.76 comes out reading these books sitting here talking to you guys this is just unbelievable part of history
02:42:11.76 --> 02:42:19.76 and a true look at the heroism that you all and American soldiers displayed in Vietnam
02:42:20.88 --> 02:42:27.44 echo Charles do you have any questions I do not no questions from echo Charles if he doesn't ask
02:42:27.44 --> 02:42:32.48 any questions that means he's going to talk a lot later so I have to put up with that but that's just
02:42:32.48 --> 02:42:37.36 the way it is that's part of the punishment I guess for me no and I just just shows the depth that we
02:42:37.36 --> 02:42:43.28 went into you know I'll fill that I'm at the end okay to dump to the detail right I want to thank you
02:42:43.28 --> 02:42:49.60 for ask him to be here and I want to thank Matt Jackson for putting it all together and I'm
02:42:49.60 --> 02:43:00.88 finally glad to meet the man I saw on the damn bun genusia right on anything else Jay no sure
02:43:01.52 --> 02:43:06.96 well again like you said thanks to Colonel Matt Jackson for introducing us and for his
02:43:06.96 --> 02:43:14.48 efforts and writing these books and preserving these these heroic deeds of our combat aviators and
02:43:14.48 --> 02:43:20.56 soldiers in Vietnam war and of course thank you for joining us and sharing your experiences your
02:43:20.56 --> 02:43:28.16 lessons learned and most important thank you thank you for your service and sacrifice to our great
02:43:28.16 --> 02:43:37.60 nation the bravery of you of your fellow pilots of the of the air crews the bravery that you all showed
02:43:37.60 --> 02:43:47.04 can never be questioned and we are grateful for your heroism and the example that you set for all of
02:43:47.04 --> 02:44:00.72 us today thank you thanks for coming on and with that major J. T. has left the building not even much
02:44:00.72 --> 02:44:07.84 to say to follow that up just just mayhem I have a lot to say actually but I won't go into as deep as
02:44:07.84 --> 02:44:16.64 maybe I could but I will say this I was talking to Nick I'll say and whatever we were talking about
02:44:16.64 --> 02:44:24.88 it reminded me of this where like nowadays okay not nowadays but in the Vietnam war there are so many
02:44:24.88 --> 02:44:31.92 people who did so many crazy things but they don't have necessarily a big spotlight on them they're
02:44:31.92 --> 02:44:38.16 just like just kind of cruising now where you don't you know they're not in the spotlight in any
02:44:38.16 --> 02:44:43.44 way they're just like essentially now they're just sort of just living normal people well it's always
02:44:43.44 --> 02:44:52.64 interesting to me that like major J. T. retired in 1988 I came in in 1998 1990 right so there's almost
02:44:52.64 --> 02:44:59.20 overlap there and there's been plenty of old Vietnam guys in the seal teams some but you know I'd
02:44:59.20 --> 02:45:06.000 be meeting some random army dude you know and he could have easily been this guy you know there are
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:12.80 people in Vietnam that did the craziest stuff and no one knows about it literally things that are
02:45:12.80 --> 02:45:17.68 going to be in a movie literally did those things that are going to be in a movie and people be like
02:45:17.68 --> 02:45:23.28 oh I wonder why they wrote it just made it so crazy yeah where they got us to spend their
02:45:23.28 --> 02:45:27.28 disbelief or what is that suspension yeah they kind of got to do that about something that really
02:45:27.28 --> 02:45:31.36 happened in real life yeah that kind of meanwhile he's just cruising I mean even though I was talking
02:45:31.36 --> 02:45:37.92 to tilt yesterday hell yeah we're actually Saturday we're talking tilt on Saturday and and he was you
02:45:37.92 --> 02:45:46.72 know they amount of times that those guys did crazy things it's unbelievable it's unbelievable and
02:45:46.72 --> 02:45:51.60 no one really knew too much about sag I'm a look if you are if you're deeply into the military
02:45:51.60 --> 02:45:58.000 history and all that but a normal everyday person barely knows anything about sock yeah I didn't
02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.80 for sure there's one thing he mentioned that was pretty dark and then he just moved right on
02:46:02.80 --> 02:46:09.36 when he's like you just you don't want to get burned up oh yeah as a pilot he was in the book that was
02:46:09.36 --> 02:46:16.000 in the book lamb song 719 yeah he said how like in world war two like some man we're known yeah
02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.40 one more one before parachutes yeah you carry a pistol kill with you catch fire just going to kill
02:46:20.40 --> 02:46:26.16 yourself that's how bad it was yeah that was interesting and it was also interesting and in the first
02:46:26.16 --> 02:46:31.20 book by Matt Jackson he's explaining you know basically that a helicopter doesn't want to fly
02:46:31.20 --> 02:46:39.28 yeah this thing does this is a bunch of metal the gear and oil gears and oil and gas that doesn't
02:46:39.28 --> 02:46:44.64 want to fly if you just let it go it's just going to crash an airplane even if you let go the controls
02:46:44.64 --> 02:46:49.60 it's kind of kind of cruise you know you kind of feel like I'm not a pilot I don't know if you
02:46:49.60 --> 02:46:55.12 do that but it feels like on an in their plane something goes wrong or whatever as long as you got wings
02:46:55.12 --> 02:47:00.88 in the in the tail you can kind of just glide that way in yeah it feels like that so I had a car this
02:47:00.88 --> 02:47:08.64 is how my first deployment to go on parking the do when we get over there all the all the seals
02:47:08.64 --> 02:47:13.92 we'd buy go on bombs we call them just like a piece of junk car whatever you know that you're
02:47:13.92 --> 02:47:18.08 just going to drive around go on for a few for six months and then sell it to the next set so we bought
02:47:18.08 --> 02:47:24.16 our go on bomb from some other team guys that were leaving we had this it was uh I think it was a
02:47:24.16 --> 02:47:33.92 1977 Velare was beige but here's the thing cars are kind of you'd think cars would be like oh
02:47:35.12 --> 02:47:39.12 you don't really you know if you if you don't touch controls it's just kind of going to go until
02:47:39.12 --> 02:47:45.12 it's just going to go straight to it by stops right yeah this car I don't know what was wrong
02:47:45.12 --> 02:47:49.44 if you let your hands off the wheels it would go into a full hard right turn as hard as you could
02:47:49.44 --> 02:47:54.32 pop you couldn't turn a car to the right as fast as this car would turn for it's own
02:47:56.72 --> 02:48:03.44 go on bomb that was our bomb the full already but also for whatever reason had hot
02:48:04.32 --> 02:48:11.04 scorching air you know you know you know you know the little like area underneath the back window
02:48:11.04 --> 02:48:16.56 on the old school cars there's a little area yeah it's like a back dash yeah you could throw like
02:48:16.56 --> 02:48:22.64 a a a a pair of slippers up there so it may be a t-shirt or sweatshirt right this little area like that
02:48:22.64 --> 02:48:29.04 and there can sometimes be aftermarket speakers be put in there right but there was no there was no
02:48:29.04 --> 02:48:35.60 aftermarket speakers but there was just scorching hot air that came to the side no it's like
02:48:35.60 --> 02:48:42.48 unknown source of massive it would fire through that thing so that car was kind of like a helicopter
02:48:42.48 --> 02:48:46.64 if you'd script your fingers off the controls for a second you were hitting the right guardrail
02:48:46.64 --> 02:48:52.64 in point two seconds oh yeah so yeah when do you get the impression and maybe you probably
02:48:52.64 --> 02:48:59.28 know this even firsthand where just in Vietnam rain wartime just in general like just things are just
02:48:59.28 --> 02:49:05.52 loud the things are so loud and there's so much louder in real life than they are in the movies
02:49:05.52 --> 02:49:10.80 yes I know that's your reference for instance in a helicopter you can't hear anything yes
02:49:10.80 --> 02:49:17.84 so freaking loud it's ridiculous it's punishing on your ears it's so loud and a helicopter
02:49:17.84 --> 02:49:25.04 yeah everything is louder I mean a humv is freaking loud tanks are loud everything's loud
02:49:25.04 --> 02:49:30.72 and everything's just vibrating just your whole world is that yeah it's cool now we got those new
02:49:31.68 --> 02:49:38.64 ear like headsets right that block out loud noises yeah the Kent noise can't slink
02:49:38.64 --> 02:49:42.96 that he said something about one the first I think it was like the first time where he
02:49:43.52 --> 02:49:51.20 heard the M60 when when he was and how we'd like vibrate the the thing and that's what I was
02:49:51.20 --> 02:49:55.12 like the whole thing is just loud no your whole world is just loud up there because you got the
02:49:55.12 --> 02:50:01.28 helicopter then you got the guns and everything is vibrating loud just the hostile the other
02:50:01.28 --> 02:50:08.24 interesting thing is I think of hewis I think of hewis as being old right in my mind they're old
02:50:08.24 --> 02:50:13.52 because I flew around on hewis and they were old kind of like when you think of a bomber right
02:50:13.52 --> 02:50:19.60 now like a world war two bomber you think of this old you know those were the most modern
02:50:19.60 --> 02:50:23.76 beasts of their time that was like getting those noise that was like yeah to a noise right
02:50:23.76 --> 02:50:33.28 straight up so well listen obviously like I said at the end there guys like major J.T.
02:50:33.28 --> 02:50:41.36 they said a great example for us on many levels courage we you know like for sure
02:50:42.88 --> 02:50:50.64 capability a hundred percent I'm not sure what we're doing to improve our courage what can we
02:50:50.64 --> 02:50:55.44 do to improve our capabilities. Equitrals there's a softball for you knock it out of the park
02:50:56.56 --> 02:51:01.36 do me a favor capability hey okay we're working out we're on the path
02:51:01.36 --> 02:51:07.92 that's it hundred percent I say on the program by the way you know like when the
02:51:07.92 --> 02:51:12.80 we're different now your wife comes home and it's like oh yeah like do you want some extra
02:51:12.80 --> 02:51:18.32 cheese on the lasagna you know I said no no no I'm on the program so it's kind of okay understand you know
02:51:18.88 --> 02:51:23.44 now you're on the path but here's the thing the path is more broad more encompassing oh yeah
02:51:23.44 --> 02:51:27.84 the program seems like you can easily be off the program in like three four weeks or whatever you know
02:51:27.84 --> 02:51:32.08 it's like that kind of feeling it's not they're not hard and fast rules but I'm just saying the
02:51:32.08 --> 02:51:39.52 feeling is there let's put it this way if you're on the path it's a life yeah it's like life yeah
02:51:39.52 --> 02:51:44.72 you're right programs of temporary yes somewhat yeah they're like a temporary improvement deviation
02:51:44.72 --> 02:51:49.76 whatever either way we're on the path the good thing about the path is sure we have supplementation
02:51:49.76 --> 02:51:55.44 but these are everyday supplementation their life supplementation elements seem saying
02:51:55.44 --> 02:52:03.60 so some of us back in the day we said drink energy drinks junk energy drinks junk
02:52:03.60 --> 02:52:09.20 it's a new um it's a new era of energy drink does a new era of energy drinks now healthy
02:52:09.20 --> 02:52:13.28 energy drinks to kind of when you drink it you get everything front end you get everything you
02:52:13.28 --> 02:52:20.08 wanted energy then on the back end you get everything that you didn't expect but want
02:52:20.08 --> 02:52:26.56 to help and you don't get things that you didn't want jitters no diabetes chemical
02:52:27.76 --> 02:52:33.84 disturbance inside your system some weird addiction inflammation you know this weird stuff
02:52:33.84 --> 02:52:38.72 yeah exactly if we don't want yep none of that none absolutely none so okay so
02:52:38.72 --> 02:52:43.36 jacco discipline go this is the energy drink you've been in no already some new flavors out
02:52:43.36 --> 02:52:50.08 which just adds to the choices you have hey look we all like orange we all like orange it's a staple
02:52:50.08 --> 02:52:55.44 right you hard pressed to find someone who doesn't like orange flavor true yeah cool but
02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.48 do we love orange maybe maybe maybe maybe that's okay I don't know if it does I don't just wait good
02:53:00.48 --> 02:53:04.80 do they do they yeah yeah that makes sense totally makes sense but not all of us do some of us like
02:53:04.80 --> 02:53:12.96 more exotic flavors like mango mango has the capability to be like love I love mango oranges
02:53:12.96 --> 02:53:17.44 more like yeah of course I like mango orange seems same what about the other end of the
02:53:17.44 --> 02:53:22.08 spectrum are people more like well mango is not really my thing I'll drink orange but mango is not
02:53:22.08 --> 02:53:28.08 my thing it's possible just saying take one extreme you gotta probably end up with the other one
02:53:28.08 --> 02:53:34.88 as well it's very possible nonetheless we're we're adding to the the spectrum of desirable flavors
02:53:34.88 --> 02:53:39.52 in discipline go so now you got a win win win win situation for everybody three wins three wins
02:53:39.52 --> 02:53:44.56 okay all day maybe even four later just saying it's always improving this good it's good you're
02:53:44.56 --> 02:53:48.08 better off after you drink one of these what about water on what about new water about what
02:53:48.08 --> 02:53:54.08 but what but what but what but salt watermelon yeah same same I think that's closer to orange in terms
02:53:54.08 --> 02:54:01.92 of people it being a more broadly accepted flavor yeah you know anyone that does not like
02:54:01.92 --> 02:54:07.04 watermelon I don't know anyone who does not like what you know and it does not like mango
02:54:07.04 --> 02:54:14.40 yes see psychos but it's like you know some either way I get it I get it into each
02:54:14.40 --> 02:54:18.56 their own I can honestly say that with with the gender you kind of rolled the dice then with the
02:54:18.56 --> 02:54:26.32 mango you know hey yeah actually no because when we chose the mango I chose that because I
02:54:26.32 --> 02:54:30.48 personally like it and that would be little kind of said he said hey if it's you if you like it
02:54:30.48 --> 02:54:35.60 that's it so it's like cool I like it right on well it seems like drinks energy drinks is what you
02:54:35.60 --> 02:54:38.96 were saying you can get them yes sir it's a new air like I said they're good for you the
02:54:38.96 --> 02:54:44.56 thing is that's a big deal though like come on you'd be hard for us to find a good tasting energy
02:54:44.56 --> 02:54:49.04 drink that after you drink it you're better off it's good for you you don't have to do a
02:54:49.04 --> 02:54:53.84 bunch of like health freaking recovery things after you drink energy you don't go to go
02:54:53.84 --> 02:55:01.44 to go on a 14 day detox yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm super low in calories to buy the way also
02:55:01.44 --> 02:55:06.24 what else we got extra protein in the form of a dessert best tasting protein in the world pretty much
02:55:07.12 --> 02:55:11.92 you'd be hard to press to find a better tasting protein with that the health nutrient profile
02:55:11.92 --> 02:55:16.48 that we have the only thing that could possibly taste better as a protein is just steak itself
02:55:16.48 --> 02:55:22.32 it's possible very hard comparison that as we know you can have a gorgeous
02:55:22.32 --> 02:55:30.24 of gorgeous rib eye steak well marble tasty cooked to a tea season to perform season to perfection
02:55:30.24 --> 02:55:33.44 and you can still get that would be like I want something to eat some milk yeah you want to
02:55:33.44 --> 02:55:37.68 cook some milk bread that has been me actually for the last four three out of the last four days
02:55:38.32 --> 02:55:42.32 hundred percent that's interesting either way these are all good things that will keep you on the
02:55:42.32 --> 02:55:46.48 path and front end end back end benefit hundred percent there's nothing better than more
02:55:46.48 --> 02:55:50.08 honestly there's nothing better than milk when you get that little
02:55:52.40 --> 02:55:58.08 you get that that how's this so desire here's a okay so mostly every night
02:55:58.08 --> 02:56:05.04 the little routine mostly every night like a salad yeah as a meal like a big robust chicken it's
02:56:05.04 --> 02:56:09.36 a formula I'd give the recipe some other time but it's legit a bit it's talking about salad
02:56:09.36 --> 02:56:18.96 it's a horrible I see you're a senior is either way but but I'll mix up a milk in there
02:56:19.68 --> 02:56:24.24 in the salad without a salad with the salad give you drink water whatever you drink with salad
02:56:24.24 --> 02:56:27.84 whatever for some reason the milk with the salad is the perfect combo right before
02:56:27.84 --> 02:56:34.000 that that's in my experience check anyway are also we have other stuff too for immunity for
02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.68 your joints these are these are things we don't want to worry about on the on this path
02:56:38.16 --> 02:56:41.36 we don't want to worry about how strong our immune system is we don't want to worry about
02:56:41.36 --> 02:56:46.48 our joints working or not working we want to just be sure and be usher it that's the things
02:56:46.48 --> 02:56:51.20 are all the fire and forget missile exactly push the button boom you're good hey
02:56:51.20 --> 02:56:57.84 enjoy warfare super cruel vitamin D3 cold war you just they're firing forget don't
02:56:57.84 --> 02:57:01.28 after you want to be thinking about your immunity system you don't want to be thinking about your
02:57:01.28 --> 02:57:07.76 joints if you're firing forget exactly right if you're on these types of supplementation elements
02:57:08.80 --> 02:57:13.60 there's only two times you're going to be thinking about this stuff is one when you get on them
02:57:13.60 --> 02:57:19.76 and they start working or potentially if you accidentally get off that's the only two times
02:57:19.76 --> 02:57:24.08 you don't really think about this stuff that's why subscribe yes subscribe if you subscribe to these

03:02:07.52 --> 03:02:13.68 makes this feel like we're due for more explosions so you bring up a good point unless if there are
03:02:13.68 --> 03:02:17.92 explosions that's where they're gonna be she make a video or everything explodes I'm about to because
03:02:17.92 --> 03:02:22.96 of how much trash you guys talking about like I'll make a regular video and people will be like
03:02:22.96 --> 03:02:31.92 I'm I'm gutted literally gutted by the lack of explosions I know it was hard to disagree at the
03:02:31.92 --> 03:02:37.84 time I mean you know our explosions appropriate at every single situation maybe maybe not unless if they
03:02:37.84 --> 03:02:44.72 if the explosions are gonna be present you're gonna find them on this youtube channel along with everything
03:02:44.72 --> 03:02:50.48 out so yeah look up for that also psychological warfare okay to know what that is it's an album

03:02:55.28 --> 03:03:03.84 and general moment of weakness so if you're in real real life if you have been a moment of weakness
03:03:03.84 --> 03:03:10.96 which we all do sometimes put in this album boom jockel will tell you why you should you know
03:03:10.96 --> 03:03:18.96 not succumb to the weakness if you want a visual representation of this stuff go to flipsidegames.com

03:03:23.36 --> 03:03:28.72 we also have some books and hey the books I talked about today undone to encourage is the series there's
03:03:28.72 --> 03:03:35.84 three volumes out right now covered one covered volume number one which is an assault unit as an assault
03:03:35.84 --> 03:03:42.80 helicopter unit in Vietnam 1969 1970 that's episode 275 of this podcast covered book three today
03:03:42.80 --> 03:03:49.44 lambson seven one nine book two is called metal of honor I'm sure we'll get to that book it at some point
03:03:49.44 --> 03:03:54.48 um you can pick up the series of books there just an incredible account that you have to read to
03:03:54.48 --> 03:04:02.08 really to really understand the kind of chaos that was going on we have a new book final spin I have a new book final
03:04:02.08 --> 03:04:08.88 spin it is a we don't really know what to call it literature it is literature of some kind yeah
03:04:09.52 --> 03:04:16.56 it could be a poem it could be prose oh it's prose I don't know there's some very poetic
03:04:16.56 --> 03:04:23.92 looking things in there the way it's the way it's written it's prose elements I guess yeah uh you can
03:04:23.92 --> 03:04:32.08 check that out you you it's it's available for pre order right now I'm gonna say the publisher likely
03:04:32.08 --> 03:04:39.68 won't print enough because they're always looking to minimize any loss they're looking to maximize
03:04:39.68 --> 03:04:45.68 profit okay that's cool the running company I get it they don't want to print too many copies
03:04:45.68 --> 03:04:50.72 now some copies sitting around so they're gonna minimize they're they're low-balling it
03:04:51.60 --> 03:04:55.68 so that what does that mean to you it means you end up with second edition against the will
03:04:56.96 --> 03:04:58.96 and it's cool but at some point you're gonna meet me
03:05:00.08 --> 03:05:04.48 gotta come I'm not gonna say I'll sign your second edition but I'm gonna know and you're gonna know
