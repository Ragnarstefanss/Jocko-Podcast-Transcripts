[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 295 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo.
[00:00:07] Good evening. On November 14th, 2001, the troops of General Faheen Khan rolled into
[00:00:16] Kabul and liberated the city from five years of despotic rule by the Taliban. To win over
[00:00:24] the pastions in the south and begin operations against the Taliban, the coalition planned
[00:00:28] to insert two ODAs near the city of Kandahar. Major Donald Bulldog was a member of Special
[00:00:37] Operations Command and Control element 52, which had tacked control of the two ODAs. Bulldog
[00:00:45] explained the mission. Quote. Basically from November 2001 until complete, we were able to
[00:00:52] provide C2 and conduct unconventional warfare in order to advise and assist Hamid Kharsai
[00:00:59] and Google Sharsai in organizing anti-Taliban forces, which was what they were called at
[00:01:06] the time and to conduct combat operations against the Taliban and alkyte forces and quote.
[00:01:13] Bulldog further described the key tasks that the ODA had to accomplish with their Afghan
[00:01:20] partners quote. We were to secure Kandahar city, develop a plan to stabilize Kandahar city
[00:01:27] and operate from a secure base. And then concentrically improve that security from Kandahar
[00:01:33] city, which was considered the cultural and religious center of gravity out to other provinces
[00:01:39] in the south and then on order, extra trait the operational area. Coalition leaders also
[00:01:47] understood that they could not simply leave the area once Kandahar was out of the Taliban
[00:01:53] grip, but had to set conditions for the next phase of the campaign. Major Bulldog asserted
[00:02:01] that the end state for the ODAs was the creation of a quote, stable, safe and secure Kandahar
[00:02:09] city ready to transition to more formalized humanitarian assistance and nation building operations.
[00:02:21] And that right there is a excerpt from a document that was written by the combat studies institute
[00:02:29] press of the U.S. Army School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the document is called a different
[00:02:35] kind of war. The United States Army in operation and during freedom from October 2001 to September
[00:02:44] 2005. And when you think about that segment that I opened up with, that's 14 November, that's just
[00:02:57] over two months after September 11, 2001, 60 days. And in that minimal amount of time,
[00:03:07] America went from peace and relative tranquility to war and to chaos. And men in the military who had
[00:03:21] been planning another standard day at work or preparing for another training exercise or maybe
[00:03:30] planning to take a billet where they could go get some more time with their family. Suddenly,
[00:03:37] these men were at war. The opening piece I read mentioned major Don Bulldog.
[00:03:46] He was obviously one of those men that shipped off to Afghanistan to begin trying to sort
[00:03:56] that place out. And that first appointment in 2001 was just the beginning for him.
[00:04:01] Over the following years, he would deploy to Afghanistan over and over and over again and also
[00:04:08] to Iraq and other parts of the world that were under threat. And that major would finish out
[00:04:15] his career as a Brigadier General. And it's an honor to have him here tonight to share some of his
[00:04:22] experiences and lessons learned. General Bulldog. Thank you for joining us. Well, thank you for having
[00:04:29] me. It's an honor to be here. You know, as I was reading that and just saw that date of November
[00:04:35] 14th, 2001. And I was in the military at that time. But to think of the radical transformation that
[00:04:44] was about to take place and how quickly we went from this sort of peace time military to a war time
[00:04:51] military and all that that entailed. That's a that's a heavy situation. Let's do this. Let's
[00:05:00] rewind a little bit and learn a little bit about you where you came from, how you grew up and sort
[00:05:08] of how you ended up in the situation that you're in right now. Sure. So, so let's start at the beginning.
[00:05:16] So, the beginning. I was born in La Coney, a new Hampshire. I've been a resident of the state of
[00:05:20] New Hampshire for 59 years and I'm 59 years old. I learned my work ethic on our family farm and
[00:05:27] geofrid, new Hampshire. We had a dairy farm. We had a vegetable farm, maple syrup. The farm has been
[00:05:36] in existence since 1779. Our family is the second owner of that farm. My grandfather bought it in 18.
[00:05:45] My great grandfather bought it in 1899 coming down from Canada. And my grandfather had 13 children.
[00:05:58] And my dad was seven of the 13. And what us bald ex-did was we worked farm. That's how we learned.
[00:06:10] We planted gardens chopped wood. You know, back in the day we'd in the deep snow. My brother and I like
[00:06:20] we had our harnesses and we would pull the sleds and we would dump the maple syrup into the
[00:06:26] container. Now it's all done by gravity through plastic pipes right into the sappaus.
[00:06:36] Before it was done by good old fashioned grandchildren, right? You know? And so, I wouldn't trade
[00:06:47] that for anything. It got me tough in the winter, tough in the summer, tough in the fall.
[00:06:51] I built more stone walls than I needed to do. So, moving rocks from point A to point P was never
[00:06:55] a problem. I went to Catholic school and got my butt kicked by nuns on a regular basis.
[00:07:03] And so, when I went to basic training in 1981 after high school,
[00:07:09] putting a dude at me, wake me up early. Y'all at me? I don't know how many times my dad told me
[00:07:15] I was about as useful as a snowball in hell. You know what I mean? But he, you know, he loved me.
[00:07:20] Right? He was just trying to prepare me for the world. You know? It's not going to be easy out there.
[00:07:24] You got to use your head, right? What made you enlist in the army? My grandfather on the
[00:07:30] bald side had a policy that all baldic males will serve their country. He didn't care if it was
[00:07:35] a national guard, reserves, active duty of what service it was, but you will serve and if you don't
[00:07:39] serve, you're not welcome. And he never served because when he got here, he was too old.
[00:07:45] He was too old for World War I, but he nonetheless, I had uncles that served. World War II,
[00:07:59] Korea, Vietnam, every conflict in the bald exhibit, since World War II. Right? And we didn't get
[00:08:06] here until 1899. And so my grandfather had to establish some children and some grandchildren before
[00:08:14] he could start populating the US military. But when I went into the, I went into my recruiter in the
[00:08:24] 11th grade because I knew I had to do it. So I went in in 11th grade and at that time they had the
[00:08:29] delayed entry program where if you joined early, you got credit for that service. Plus,
[00:08:35] you went in as a mosquito wing private, you know, instead of just a slick sleeve private, right?
[00:08:41] Which was like, you know, $5 more a month. Right? And back then it was double your basic
[00:08:46] patch. That's right back then it was $200 a month. So I was pretty happy, right? So it was good. And
[00:08:54] you know, before that though in high school, I joined the police cadet program in
[00:09:01] Lekonia, New Hampshire. And that's a funny story how that started, right? I was in 10th grade
[00:09:10] and we were walking over from high school. After school, but before we had to leave for a football
[00:09:18] game. And it was an away game and I was walking over the group of the guys over to the, to the
[00:09:24] little store to pick up some, some child for the bus, right? And, and I, uh, there was this
[00:09:32] coat can set up perfectly right on the curb of the road. And I thought, man, I'm going to go kick
[00:09:40] that. So I started talking about, you know, uh, and five seconds left in the game. But, you know,
[00:09:47] I kicked that ball. I kicked that can. And it hit the side of a police cruiser,
[00:09:53] parked at the light. And so I know him now, starting being us, jumps out of that car and he is
[00:10:04] pissed off. And everybody get on the ground so we're all laying on the ground. And he's like, who did it?
[00:10:10] So my raise my hand, I go, I did it, sir. And he puts me in the back of the cruiser and
[00:10:15] he's yelling at the other kids and, you know, my friends and they ran off and I'm sitting in the
[00:10:23] cruiser and he goes, so, would you do that for? And I explained to him what I was doing and he said,
[00:10:29] all right, sounds like an accident to me. He goes, if you're heard of the police get up program,
[00:10:35] I go, no, sir. He goes, well, I think you'd be a good kid for that program, right? Because
[00:10:42] you had enough balls to own up to it, you know? And I said, all right, so I did it and I got selected
[00:10:49] and I started out and I really loved it. So in 1980, year before I graduated from my school, I
[00:11:00] had the opportunity to go through the part-time police academy program. And so I did it and
[00:11:08] I ended up getting qualified as a police officer. So when I went into my senior year,
[00:11:13] at 18 years old, I was a qualified police officer working for the Co. and a police department.
[00:11:18] And I did that for a year before I went into the army and went into the army for
[00:11:27] 181 to 84. And where are you active duty? I was active duty. Okay, it's basically a little bit like
[00:11:38] a break for you because you're not on the dairy farm. That's right, it's a huge break. Well,
[00:11:43] it's a huge break because it's not, you know, you can imagine being a police officer while you're
[00:11:48] in your senior year high school. Mr. Poppillar? That's right, Mr. Poppillar. Every party that got
[00:11:54] busted up was my fault. I obviously had inside information that I passed on to the police.
[00:12:00] And it'd done work that way. I mean, we don't care about parties, but your neighbors do,
[00:12:05] particularly when it gets too loud. Right, so they call. And I just couldn't get that point across.
[00:12:10] But nonetheless, after serving as a police officer and, you know, I mean,
[00:12:17] you know, my dad was a taskmaster, right? I mean, he was a strong good man who is no longer with us,
[00:12:25] but nonetheless served 35 years as a city councilman and mayor for our city school board,
[00:12:36] just a great pillar of the community in addition to being a, you know, a guy that would
[00:12:43] do anything for anybody. And so anyways, I had learned all that stuff, but working on the dairy farm,
[00:12:50] you know, hanging, hangs the worst thing you can do in the world, right? I mean, I hated hanging
[00:12:55] season. When July rolled around, I prayed for rain because we couldn't, we didn't, you couldn't,
[00:13:00] he can't hang in the rain. But it didn't happen, right? I had a guy who was a new guy
[00:13:06] came to work for me when I was at Seal team 7. And he was a hard work and kid up, ready to move
[00:13:15] sandbags, fill sandbags, move steel around, dump ammo, pick up ammo, whatever I need him to,
[00:13:21] find me after a couple weeks and I'm not too impressed. You have to be a really hard worker
[00:13:26] to impress me. And after a few weeks, I said to him, I said, hey, band, you're, because I, he had
[00:13:32] kind of just shown up in my platoon. He didn't go through our work up or anything. He was a new guy just
[00:13:35] showed up in Iraq, showed up in Iraq and he's working his ass off. And I look at him one day and I
[00:13:41] said, hey, you're, you're a hard worker, where are you from? And he said, I grew up in a dairy farm
[00:13:46] in Minnesota. And I said, well, I appreciate your hard work. He said, sir, I'll do whatever you want
[00:13:52] me to do as long as it doesn't have anything to do with cows. And he told me his schedule. He was
[00:13:59] up at 4 o'clock in the morning every day to milk cows get home in the afternoon after wrestling
[00:14:05] practice milk cows. And it was, I don't know what he had, but 300 or 400 cows he had to milk.
[00:14:10] So the dairy farm seems to breed some hard work. Yeah. Well, you know, after practice, whether
[00:14:16] it was baseball or football or whatever happened to be, my dad said, I'll see at the farm. And so I
[00:14:22] would jog from the high school up, up, moral street to the farm, you know, and, uh, and did
[00:14:30] whatever he asked me to do up on the farm. Right. And so when I got the basic training and
[00:14:35] met sword and mules, my, uh, my basic training, um, throw instructor. Um, no, he want me to make
[00:14:43] my bed. You want me to do this. You want me to do that? Yeah. You know, I was up before he threw
[00:14:48] the trash can down the aisle, right? Uh, because that's just the way it was. And, um, and he, you know,
[00:14:55] he would say to me, ball it, you don't sleep. I go and I'd say he was drill so hard and I, I do
[00:15:01] sleep, but I don't require much. Right. Um, and, uh, you know, so yeah, that kind of hard work did
[00:15:09] it. And then the discipline that the nuns instilled in me, I mean, come on. Right. It's just, it's
[00:15:13] just a loose seal. Right. I mean, she sounds scary. She is scary. She was a flaming red headed, uh,
[00:15:20] none that just scared that hell out of me. And, um, and she got her pound of flesh out of me, uh,
[00:15:27] but were you an athlete in high school? I was. Yeah. What sports did you go? I played, uh, football,
[00:15:32] baseball, and basketball. And I was told, uh, you're too small to play football, but,
[00:15:40] by myself, more years, I was, I was starting on the varsity team. Two short to play basketball,
[00:15:46] but I was a starting guard on the basketball team. Uh, I was, they told me I couldn't pitch.
[00:15:53] But I ended up being a pitcher because my arms were too short and, and I wasn't tall enough,
[00:15:57] and I couldn't get a good stretch off the mound, but, you know, so, uh, I think the farmer in me,
[00:16:05] uh, you know, don't tell me I can't do something kind of thing, right? Because, um,
[00:16:10] I'm going to try and prove you wrong. Yeah. So anyways, you know, when you enlisted in the army,
[00:16:15] did you do it? Did you plan on, was it a career? Was it reserves? Or was it active? No, it actually,
[00:16:22] uh, it was active duty. Okay. But my plan was to, um, you know, pursue the law enforcement.
[00:16:28] So when I was coming out of the army in 1984, I was a sergeant, and I was going to ROTC,
[00:16:36] green to gold program, uh, not to go on active duty, but it was through the national guard.
[00:16:41] And they were going to pay for my education, and I was going to get my commission through ROTC.
[00:16:47] In a beauty part about prior services, you don't have to do the first two years of ROTC,
[00:16:51] because you've got basic training in a.e. t.n. to your belt. So you start it, you're junior and senior years, right?
[00:16:58] And I didn't, uh, I didn't anticipate making it a career at all. Um, I wanted to be, uh,
[00:17:06] being law enforcement, but I got called down to my company commander's office, and my first
[00:17:12] serge was there, first sergeant Kingston, and in, uh, Captain Jeffrey L. A.s.
[00:17:18] was there, and he, I reported to him, position of attention, and he said,
[00:17:23] sergeant Bouldek, I know you're getting out, uh, but I want to talk to you about that,
[00:17:27] because I think you should stay in. I think you should reinlist, and I, you just came down on
[00:17:32] drill sergeant orders, and you should go be a drill sergeant, because what are your plans?
[00:17:36] And I, so I just explained, oh, what I explained to you, and he said, yeah, I, I just don't see you
[00:17:42] being successful as an officer. He said, you're enlisted material. You're, you're a sergeant major in the making,
[00:17:48] you know, so I think you should stay in, and you should fall that track, because you're going to have the most
[00:17:52] success with that. And again, this little light in the back of my head, did you just tell me I can't do something
[00:17:57] like kind of thing, and, uh, and my, you know, I took his advice, and I said, thank you,
[00:18:03] you're very much, but I followed the different path. Well, first sergeant Kingston calls me out
[00:18:09] in his office. He puts me in a front-lean and rest position, and he says, you count loud to 50.
[00:18:15] And he gets down real close to my ear, and he goes, hey, listen, he goes,
[00:18:18] you take, and you go to ROTC, and then when you get commissioned, you find wherever this captain is,
[00:18:30] in the United States of Army, and you take those bars, and you put it somewhere the sun doesn't
[00:18:35] show. That's what he says to me, and I go, yes, first sergeant, has I'm, you know,
[00:18:41] 22 for a sergeant, 23. And you know, he's, so he's like, he's like, get up, so I get up and he
[00:18:47] dismisses me. And I am a first lieutenant in special forces training at Fort Bragg North Carolina,
[00:18:54] and who's the command sergeant major of the 16th Military Police Brigade. Sergeant, command
[00:18:59] sergeant, Major Kingston. So here I am, a first lieutenant in S.F. training, and I called his office,
[00:19:07] and I told him who I was, and I asked if I could come over and have a meeting with him,
[00:19:11] so they did that, and I went over and I met with him, and he was so happy to see me, right?
[00:19:16] He goes, have you found Captain Ames? And I go, no, and he goes, you know, he's a lieutenant
[00:19:21] Colonel now, and I go, no, I didn't know it. I didn't, I haven't tracked his career, but anyway, see,
[00:19:29] he goes, I remember that day that was hilarious, and he goes, I'm glad you're doing well,
[00:19:33] you're in special forces training, because that's really great. And so we, you know,
[00:19:39] it's just, I didn't plan on going back on active duty, but I did well in ROTC, and I
[00:19:46] qualified for an active, you know, regular Army Commission, and I said, you know what?
[00:19:51] This is 1988, and it is not looking good for jobs out there, right? So I said,
[00:20:01] ah, I'll just go to Army, and we'll see how that goes. And I really didn't anticipate staying too long as an
[00:20:07] officer, you know, fulfill my requirement, you know, and, you know, perhaps get out, but
[00:20:12] it's time went on, and I went in special forces, and I'm not sure. So what was your job as an
[00:20:18] officer? Were you an infantry officer? I was, I got commissioned into the chemical corps,
[00:20:23] which was another thing I was like, what the heck, you know, I graduated number one from
[00:20:27] Northeastern University, Liberty Battalion. I was number one, and the explanation I got is,
[00:20:35] well, you know, the quality has got to be spread out across the Army, and it's based on needs of the
[00:20:40] Army. So I was like, okay, sounds like a good, so what was it chemical officer? Chemical officer,
[00:20:46] nuclear biological and chemical officer, but you know what? When I was looking to get out,
[00:20:51] after my requirement, wow, that's a good opportunity. Big bucks, great opportunities. I was like,
[00:20:59] wow, the good Lord was smiling on me, because, you know, and I went to Ranger School,
[00:21:06] and I did all those things that you're supposed to do, so when I showed up at the combat
[00:21:10] arms units, right, and I had that, you know, I wasn't just a support guy, right? You know, okay,
[00:21:16] this guy, prior and listed Ranger School graduate, you know, Airborne School, you know, the whole
[00:21:21] nine yard, and so it just gave you more credibility, and as an enlisted guy served in the fourth
[00:21:26] ID in the second Airborne, so I had that in my background, and so it was all good, but, but, you know,
[00:21:34] yeah, chemical corps, you get put on the battalion staff, and you have to do the, you know,
[00:21:39] you get, you get all the, you know, nobody's really interested in doing nuclear biological and
[00:21:44] chemical. So you get, you get all the, you know, the interesting assignments, and I did those
[00:21:52] with a smile on my face and the best my ability, and then, you know, I was the first chemical
[00:21:58] officer to make it through special forces selection and training. So did you, well, at what
[00:22:03] point did you learn about special forces? Well, I learned about special forces in 1968 when I
[00:22:09] watched the Green Brave movie with my grandfather, and, and so I was like, oh, wow, John Wayne,
[00:22:17] the Green Brave, you know, so it was always something in the back of my mind, and then I was in
[00:22:22] Korea, my first lieutenant assignment, and the Green Brave recruited showed up, and I went, and I said,
[00:22:29] I'm going to do that, right, and so that's what I did. Where were you in the first goal for
[00:22:34] what happened? I was in 10 special forces group, okay, and so we did that there, and then we rotated
[00:22:43] over to provide comfort, the humanitarian assistance thing up in Northern Iraq, which was great
[00:22:49] experience with the Kurds, and yeah, so I mean, God just kept opening up these little doors
[00:22:57] for me to like, you know, scoot through, and before I knew it, it was, you know, I was major on my
[00:23:07] way to command a general staff college, and halfway to retirement, you know, 20 years, and I had a few
[00:23:14] extra years because I've been with you the time, so I was like, you know, hey, if I make it to Lieutenant
[00:23:19] Colonel, I'm going to be doing pretty damn good, so I was pretty happy about that. So, so you went
[00:23:25] through special forces in what year, through, through the selection? I went through selection in
[00:23:31] 1992, February of 1992. How was that? Was it challenging for you? Did you enjoy it? Was it what you
[00:23:40] expected it to be? Yeah, I expected a smoke show, and that's what I got, right, and I really likes
[00:23:47] the special forces selection process because nobody said anything to you, right? All your
[00:23:55] instructions were written up on a board, and you had to be conscientious enough to check that
[00:24:00] board frequently because they would do things like change it, right? And then try and catch it,
[00:24:05] right, not paying attention. And it was athletic events, you know, that you had to do. It was like
[00:24:13] right up my alley, right? So it was like, yeah, good quality smoke show, nobody yelled at you.
[00:24:20] They sleep the pride and they gave you really good. I called it, I called it building Barney
[00:24:26] Rubble Machines, right, because it was like, oh, here's a trailer with only one tire, and
[00:24:32] here's some straps, and here's some poles, and you know, you got to move it 10 kilometers, and
[00:24:38] you know, they would set up these tabs, and you had to build like, so it was like on the farm.
[00:24:42] Like our farm was like a OSHA nightmare, you know, we really didn't believe in the OSHA
[00:24:48] safety hazard. So huge safety hazard, right? And so, you know, coming up with a fix for the
[00:24:54] tractor, for the hay bailer, when it went down, or something like that, was, you know,
[00:25:01] it was always right there, right? And you know, my dad's like, hey, we don't have, we don't have time,
[00:25:05] and we don't have the money to go pay for this machine. So what's, you know, use some nylon,
[00:25:11] and some straps, and figure this out, right? And so that's what SF training was about, you know,
[00:25:16] it was like, hey, you know, here's a bunch of pieces of equipment, figure out how to get it,
[00:25:22] 10 kilometers, and good luck, right? And work as a team and support each other. So, you know,
[00:25:29] that's what farming is all about. And not one person makes that farm run. It's a collective team.
[00:25:33] That's what my grandfather had 13 kids. That's why he has over, you know, 500 grandchildren
[00:25:40] to make it work. You bring everybody together, and you just make it work. So that's what I like
[00:25:45] about, you know, special forces training. And I like the idea, but not everybody could make it,
[00:25:52] right, that there was this huge attrition rate. And so I thought that was cool too, because
[00:26:00] it was this, it was a special thing, right? Not everybody can get through, and only
[00:26:07] only a certain type of person can get through it. Doesn't make you any better than anybody else,
[00:26:12] it just makes you different, right? And that's what America's about. Was there anything that was
[00:26:17] hard for you, or especially hard for you? Yeah, anything that required height. Because I'm sure
[00:26:25] at 5 foot 7. So, you know, these things that required height, and then keeping up with
[00:26:31] guys with long legs on the Ruck March, I would, it was a Ruck jog for me to keep up,
[00:26:36] because these guys had just this incredibly long stride, and it was like, God bless America.
[00:26:44] Yeah. You know, come on, cut that stride in half, you know, but, you know, they, they move
[00:26:50] at their pace, and they can't, they can't be slackened, because, you know, then the instructor
[00:26:55] sees their slackened. For me, I'll pick up a job, right? So that's the way we did it.
[00:27:01] And you're married when you were going through special forces training, right? Yes, yeah,
[00:27:05] yeah, I got married as a second lieutenant. I met my wife Sharon and college.
[00:27:12] We were both in the ROTC program together. She was studying nursing, and she was, she joined the
[00:27:18] Army at 17 years old, had to get her mom's mission. She went into the medical field, right,
[00:27:24] and down to Fort Sam Houston, did her training. And she's a, she's, she's as hard as woodpecker
[00:27:31] lips. And I always like, I always like to say, you know, so a surprise for me is that, you know,
[00:27:37] I married a woman that wore combat boots. So that was always, that was always a cool thing. But yeah,
[00:27:44] she, she was great and, you know, and she, and she, I understand the Army and understood what
[00:27:51] you were going through. And I always asked her, right? I said, hey, I want to do this, right?
[00:27:56] You know, can I get your support? You know, I mean, it's not going to be easy for the family.
[00:28:04] And that's why, you know, leading up to 2001, we had nine, 11, we were gone a lot,
[00:28:11] because during the Clinton years, we redound size the conventional forces, a lot of the
[00:28:17] engagement and stuff felt a special option. We had to go deploy on all kinds of different things out there.
[00:28:23] So we were gone a lot. And so when we were gone a lot after 2001, my wife just took it and
[00:28:30] strike, right? And so when she started hearing people say, wow, you know, they never home any more.
[00:28:36] And she, she would, she would be able to use her experience to explain, hey, you know, this is,
[00:28:41] this is what it's all about, right? And so she was very, very good inside the family readiness
[00:28:48] groups and, you know, very, very supportive, particularly during deployments. And, you know, when we
[00:28:55] had casualties and she, she had that frame of reference, you know, and she always there, we've been
[00:29:03] married for over 32 years now and I have never, she's never, ever, faltered. Even when I, even,
[00:29:10] you know, even when I wasn't a very good version of myself because of post-traumatic stress and
[00:29:14] traumatic brain injury and, you know, pain management issues and, you know, I mean, that
[00:29:22] negatively affected my personal professional life too, you know. When, before we get into that,
[00:29:30] when you are talking about the 90s or now you're, what's, what's special forces unit,
[00:29:34] just checking to you when you got done with special forces group? Fifth special forces group,
[00:29:38] Fort Campbell Kentucky. And then you were doing lots of J-sets, had no receipts, build these relationships,
[00:29:46] filling some of the gaps that were left by the downsizing conventional forces. And what was your,
[00:29:51] what was your, did you do, uh, platoon command? Did you do a team? Did you do a company command? Like,
[00:29:56] what was your bill it's there? So I was a detachment commander, ODA 582 and third battalion, fifth group.
[00:30:03] Um, and were you guys doing, like, regular deployments? Would you go on deployment? So,
[00:30:09] yeah, when in the 90s when I was in the SEAL teams, we would go on a six month deployment. Maybe
[00:30:15] we'd go to Asia, maybe we'd go to Southwest Asia, maybe we'd go on a ship, but you were doing
[00:30:20] a workup and you were going on a long deployment. Were you guys on the schedule like that? Exactly
[00:30:25] like that, exactly like that. But with fifth group, I went to one of two places. It was either
[00:30:31] Eastern Africa, normally Kenya, or it was in the Middle East, you know, and we had, um, you know,
[00:30:42] Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, you know, those places. Yeah, yeah, we must across paths
[00:30:53] at some point along the way. We had to, we were at the drive exit. I did a bunch of shipboard deployments
[00:30:59] in the 90s and, and one where I wasn't on board a ship, but yeah, we were constantly pulling into
[00:31:04] all those places and doing whatever kind of exercises, um, just always, always over there.
[00:31:10] One of the, uh, one of the interesting deployments that we went on that I thought was, was really,
[00:31:18] really good to work on your trade craft was, um, JTF Bravo. The drug-interdiction missions that we did
[00:31:27] on the southern border, and we would, uh, we would deploy for 120 days to the southern border,
[00:31:34] and we worked from the Texas border to the New Mexico border, Arizona, and California, and we
[00:31:41] culminated in California and the Cleveland National Forest, searching for marijuana fields, and,
[00:31:47] and getting scared to death by booby tracks, right, because they, they were everywhere, uh, and,
[00:31:55] we would track somebody and then we'd find out they're actually tracking us, you know, so it was like,
[00:32:01] holy crap, right, in America. They don't want to mean, uh, and so, but we would get into our
[00:32:07] spider holes and we would, you know, we would, you know, I mean, we would practice, um, uh, I remember
[00:32:15] given my baton commander briefing, you know, saying, hey, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna be in these
[00:32:22] holes, guys are gonna be in the holes for, uh, 72 hours, and then we're gonna, under the covered
[00:32:27] darkness rotate them out, get them back to the, um, to our, you know, mission support site, yet a
[00:32:33] debrief, and then we're gonna send them back to Phoenix to recover in a wholesale, right,
[00:32:39] clean all their kit, and we, we had this whole process, and we're gonna be, we, we made our spider
[00:32:47] holes and all our camouflage out of, uh, PVC pipes and all that stuff, right, and we break it all
[00:32:53] down, you putting your pack and then you'd set it all up and you dig your hole, and that's what
[00:32:57] you're gonna be in, right, and we, we even came up with, you know, different exercises and the
[00:33:02] spike, because it couldn't get out of spider holes, right, and so he goes, so what are you gonna do with
[00:33:07] the, uh, human waste? Well, we're gonna carry it out with us, and he goes, oh, you're gonna
[00:33:13] carry it out, and I said, yeah, we're gonna carry it out with us, sorry, and he goes, I'd like to see that.
[00:33:21] So I delivered to him, a hefty bag full of extra meant pee, and I put it right on his desk,
[00:33:28] and I said, there it is, sir. I'll never forget to look around his face,
[00:33:35] the sergeant made your command, sir, made your pull me aside and he said, that was either
[00:33:39] the most brilliant thing that you ever did as a detachment commander or the dumbest thing,
[00:33:46] time will tell.
[00:33:49] Yeah, that's, oh, that's good. As soon as you said, I'd like to see that. I said, oh, he didn't, oh, yes, he did,
[00:33:56] he did, yeah. So, uh, yeah, those were interesting, I never did those missions, but I remember
[00:34:02] Platoon's getting sent out to do him, and it's basically doing reconnaissance of drug transport routes
[00:34:07] coming across the border, across this other border. We would, we would radio it into the police,
[00:34:11] and they would do the introduction, and it was just, it was just a great mission, because we knew
[00:34:18] we were doing something for our country, and then we knew we were also training the hell out of ourselves
[00:34:25] with these, you know, special reconnaissance techniques that, hey, if they see it, they compromise
[00:34:34] it, you're done. So, I mean, it was good. So, where were you when September 11th happened?
[00:34:42] I was the operations officer for 3rd Battalion or a 2nd Battalion, fit Special Forces group,
[00:34:49] and we were getting ready to go to Jordan for what was the largest
[00:34:58] sock, you know, Special Operations Command, Sent Com, Joint Chiefs of Staff missions.
[00:35:08] They basically took about 5 Joint Chiefs of Staff missions and combined them all.
[00:35:14] We were going to be headquartered in Jordan and it include Egypt, Oman, UAE, Kuwait,
[00:35:22] and it was all over that geographic area. We're going to be doing all kinds of decentralized
[00:35:26] missions and stuff in these countries, and airborne operations, and we had a, we had a Ranger company
[00:35:33] with us, and it was awesome, right? We put this all together. First time they were ever going to
[00:35:39] do something like that, and I really liked it because it was a regional approach to solving problems,
[00:35:44] right, instead of a country by country for the focus, so it was really great. And I'm a big,
[00:35:49] big believer in this, you know, regional thing. I think it works out better when people get together
[00:35:53] and try and help each other solve each other's problems as opposed to just focusing the
[00:35:57] one country at a time. Anyways, I don't want to digress. So we were getting ready to go over for
[00:36:04] that mission. I'm sitting in my office the day before we're getting ready to deploy in 9-11 hits,
[00:36:09] right, and I go down the hallway to my boss's office and I put on the television and I go
[00:36:14] search this out. By the time I turn it on, the second plane hit hit, you know, and I said,
[00:36:20] so I think we're under attack. And I said, it looks like they're going to hit every single one of
[00:36:26] our national elements of power. And you know, then Pentagon gets hit, you know, and then the plane
[00:36:33] goes down in Pennsylvania, obviously headed probably towards the Capitol or wherever that was
[00:36:39] heading. So they, you know, they hit the economic, they just hit the military, they're on their
[00:36:44] way to the political, you know, I mean, holy crap. President of the United States canceled every
[00:36:52] single exercise except for the Jordan exercise. Because it was so important to the King of Jordan
[00:37:01] to have this thing, to have this exercise because it was, he was the hub country, right? And so
[00:37:08] we deployed and we did it. And it was shortened from 45 days to 30 days. And that's, you know,
[00:37:16] we went directly from Jordan to Uzbekistan for mission planning and then into, uh, into
[00:37:25] Terran County, Afghanistan. So because so you complete this training operation in Jordan,
[00:37:31] which must have been strange doing this free-contraining operation when the, you know that the
[00:37:36] world is like a ticking time bomb. Right. It was. It was. We're watching the news all the time.
[00:37:40] And, you know, we're, I'm actually getting messages from higher headquarters, get ready, you're
[00:37:47] going to go, you're going to leave. So we got the log guys and ops guys and everybody planning to
[00:37:51] move us from Jordan to Uzbekistan. But at the same time, we have 560,000 moving parts for this
[00:38:01] 5 country operation and people doing airborne operations, live fires, you know, CQB, you know,
[00:38:10] I mean, just all kinds of high-adventure training, right? And, you know, we're doing
[00:38:17] joint and combined airborne operations. So you got, picture this. You got Americans,
[00:38:24] Jordanians, and Egyptians on the same plane, getting ready to jump out. Yihah, right?
[00:38:30] Because, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that's a, you know, I mean, we trained them, but they
[00:38:36] not necessarily follow on our training, you know? And the way some of them exit the aircraft was like,
[00:38:42] oh, we're crap. Are you kidding me? So it was like, you know, a lot of the sirens are looking at me
[00:38:49] going, you're killing me, sir, you know? Like, okay. Yeah, we're not. That's not the intent, right?
[00:38:56] But, I'm like, hey, we got to do this, right? I mean, that's what it is. And they would, they would make
[00:39:02] sure it was great. And it went off without a hitch, but. So then from there, you go to Uzbekistan?
[00:39:07] Uzbekistan. And now, are you guys getting, you guys got the tasking, okay, you're going to
[00:39:13] Afghanistan? Go to, as go to Uzbekistan to start planning. Right, because that's how many guys?
[00:39:18] It was, let me see, you know, 15 of us. And Colonel Fox had to pick him.
[00:39:25] So he picked him 15 of us went off. And then he turned over the battalion to the Exo.
[00:39:31] And the Exo stayed in place and enjoyed. And then slow but surely he would rotate the teams
[00:39:40] into Uzbekistan. Has space opened up. So what you get to Uzbekistan? I mean, what's the
[00:39:47] damn, what's the atmosphere with the team? How much do you guys know about Afghanistan prior to this? Nothing.
[00:39:55] Nothing. Absolutely. Did you learn a language as a special force officer? I did. I learned Egyptian
[00:40:01] Arabic. Okay. Now, I passed the language test. Uh-huh. But we're not going to school.
[00:40:08] Egyptian quiz show or anything. Yeah. With the lowest score of that you could get on the defense
[00:40:14] language aptitude, battery test. Apparently, God didn't give me the ability to learn foreign languages.
[00:40:23] And I did. I struggled through what Spanish and high school in college, but I struggled through it.
[00:40:28] I got through it anyways. But nonetheless, um, so the lowest score qualifies me for a romantic language,
[00:40:36] like French and Spanish and Italian. And what did they send me to? Fifth Special Forces group
[00:40:41] with a language as Egyptian Arabic category, four language. And I'm like, really? You want me to fail?
[00:40:47] Is that it? Uh, but, you know, like anything else, test scores, you know, they mean something,
[00:40:53] but they don't test. They don't test your will to do your best, right? So I ended up graduating with a
[00:41:02] two plus two plus and got language pay at $75 a month. Uh-huh. And um, and I was just, you know,
[00:41:11] I called two plus two plus just being dangerous enough to, uh, you know, use a foreign language.
[00:41:16] You know, it's, it's like, it's like being a first level black belt in martial arts, right?
[00:41:21] You're just danger enough to get yourself hurt. But it looks cool, right? Uh, but nonetheless,
[00:41:27] it is what it is. And I, um, uh, yeah, I, I, I did that, but the Egyptian Arabic does you absolutely
[00:41:37] know good in Afghanistan, with posh to and urdu and, you know, Tajik and Uzbek. And, you know,
[00:41:46] so your news about Uzbekistan, you're coming up with a plan and, and, and,
[00:41:52] who's given you direction at this point? What are you guys getting for a mission tasking? Are you
[00:41:55] getting clear directives or is it more, hey, go, go start to put something together?
[00:42:02] So to the credit of our seniors, everything was moving so fast and everything was coming out of the
[00:42:08] Pentagon and the National Command Authority so quickly, so rapidly, uh, that, you know, we weren't
[00:42:15] getting anything, right? And so, um, basically, we had two teams and then a command and control element,
[00:42:27] that had to be led by Lieutenant Colonel and that came directly from the Secretary of
[00:42:31] Defense. So, so it's not even the standard way that we would deploy into it theater of operations.
[00:42:38] So you got two teams with a battalion commander and a very small staff that were
[00:42:44] C2. Now, third battalion had the north, second battalion had the south and first battalion had,
[00:42:54] you know, the, um, the Kabul Bagram area. Um, and so when we got there, it was like, all right,
[00:43:03] you got the south, you got to go link up with the armored cars, you got these two teams,
[00:43:07] one's going to come from the south, one's going to come from the north, and figure it out.
[00:43:11] So we did. And I was happy to figure it out because it was good. How do you guys get in?
[00:43:15] So we went, uh, MH1, uh, excuse me, MC130s, uh, to Jakobabad, Pakistan. And this, this is really,
[00:43:27] it's really funny because we were told, okay, you're going to get there and you're going to
[00:43:31] go find the special ops Air Force unit. And they're the ones that are going to fly you in
[00:43:37] to Tarantown, Afghanistan, where you'll link up with a group of Afghans, and then they'll take
[00:43:45] you to harm it cars. I. So that's, so that was the plan. That was the plan. That was the plan.
[00:43:51] And where did I find the Air Force guys in the mess hall? Because I looked all around,
[00:43:56] Jakobabad, and I'd warm, right? And my boss is like, I go, sir, let's go to the mess hall.
[00:44:01] Good call. And so there they were, they were in the mess hall. And so, you know,
[00:44:06] and where they bring you up in? Like, pay blows or something? Yes. Yeah, that's exactly at MH53s.
[00:44:11] We went right in. We took fire going in. One of them was hit. They still brought us in.
[00:44:17] We did a, what I like to call a controlled crash landing. I mean, it was a hard landing. We all fell
[00:44:24] all over the place inside the damn thing. We jump out. The one advantage we had was nice night vision
[00:44:30] goggles. We didn't know where they were or who they were. But I had worked on. I had worked on
[00:44:37] one posh tune sentence. Please take us to harm it cars like. I worked on that over and over and over again.
[00:44:48] And we land, we hit the ground, dust everywhere, takes a few minutes for the dust to settle.
[00:44:56] We get into a V formation. And the plan that we had was, I go Colonel Fox, I go Sir,
[00:45:05] move forward. Once we see him, we'll set in security. I'll walk forward with my rehearsed sentence.
[00:45:12] And, you know, we'll go from there. You guys point your weapons. I'm not going to point my weapon
[00:45:18] at him, but I'm going to have it at the ready just in case I need it. And I can see him. They're all,
[00:45:23] all these have. There's about 10 Afghans there. And they're all point in their weapons at me. And I'm
[00:45:28] walking up and I look at him. And I got these AK47s right in my face. And all I could come out with was
[00:45:36] harm it cars. That's the only thing I could say. That lower her sentence gone gone. And they,
[00:45:46] you know, gave me the, you know, good, good to go. And, you know, I called up the guys. We came up.
[00:45:52] They put us in trucks. And 20 minutes later, we were meeting on the cars. I, in a mud hut.
[00:45:58] And then we started doing mud hut diplomacy. So what's mud hut diplomacy look like?
[00:46:03] It looks like a bunch of Afghans sitting on the ground with us in front of a map. And we're telling
[00:46:09] them, you know, what we're seeing from our aircraft and the sky. And are they bad guys? Are they
[00:46:15] good guys? And then we're coming up with intermediate places on the ground to go to. And our first
[00:46:21] convoy that we did this was a disaster. Little did we know that that they would all huddle around
[00:46:36] carsized vehicle because they didn't want anything to happen to them. And we had cars I in the
[00:46:40] wrong spot. So we had motorcycles and Toyota carolers and pickup trucks. We lost complete control of
[00:46:49] this convoy. And then we stopped to pray. Right in the middle of the operation, right?
[00:46:57] Is this really a safe place to stop and pray? But it didn't matter. It's time to pray. We're going to
[00:47:01] pray. So we did that. So what we did was we figured out on the next one that we would put
[00:47:08] our guys up front for security. And we put cars I back there. And nobody would pass carsized vehicle.
[00:47:16] So we made a control. Now if you turn around and looked at that gaggle back there, it was like,
[00:47:22] oh yeah, mad max. Yeah, really that's a great way to explain it. And but it worked. And so that's what
[00:47:29] we did. And as we move forward, we got more and more village elders and tribal elders into the
[00:47:36] meetings. And then of course, you know, people were talking about security concern. You know,
[00:47:40] what if someone comes in and just opens up and sprays the place. And I said, well, it's
[00:47:44] a chance we have to take. I mean, it's just part of the part of the operational environment.
[00:47:49] Yeah, you can't mitigate all risks. You can't do your best. But there's going to be some risks
[00:47:55] that you're going to have to take to achieve your mission. And they weren't in the mood for us to
[00:47:59] disarm them. They weren't in the mood for us to search them. They weren't in the mood for any of that.
[00:48:03] Right. We had to prove ourselves to them. And then they had to get comfortable with us. And we just
[00:48:09] had to trust, you know, cars eye. And trust me, the CIA guys that were there with cars eye were just as
[00:48:16] nervous as we were, just as concerned as we were. Because the last thing we wanted was cars eye to
[00:48:22] get hurt because he's on the phone with all of the news outlets. Right. In the middle of a briefing,
[00:48:32] we'd get a call. Hey, you know, you know, whatever his name is Dan Rather, or whoever wanted
[00:48:41] to talk to him. Right. And so he would take an interview right there. And then you had the bond
[00:48:46] committee that was meeting to figure out, you know, the government who's going to be the interim
[00:48:51] prime minister. And of course, cars eye at the top of the list, they want to talk to them. So in the
[00:48:55] middle of that, they call up. And they want to talk to them about stuff. And, you know, he just
[00:48:59] just sit there and listen to it. He was really good. He was really good in those days. He did a
[00:49:07] really, really good job. And I had a lot of hope, right. But, you know, things get politicized and things
[00:49:17] happen. And, you know, the longer things, you know, go on. He just, he just, you know, I really
[00:49:25] thought he did a great job, particularly at the beginning there. And, you know, the way he managed
[00:49:33] risk and the way he made decisions and the way he handled and the respect that he got, he was
[00:49:39] the right guy at the time, right. And so it was just a very, very interesting to see that.
[00:49:49] And, of course, in subsequent deployments, I had a personal relationship with cars eye. So I could
[00:49:56] leverage that pretty easily as a result of that very first rotation to explain something that
[00:50:05] had looked like in Kabul, had gone wrong. But there was a lot of things in between where it happened,
[00:50:13] and what was being told, and what was being put out by the Taliban that weren't true. And I was
[00:50:19] able to get communications to him to be able to say, hey, that's not the way it went down. Sir,
[00:50:26] please, please understand that my heart's in a right place. And he would.
[00:50:31] Now, speaking of things going wrong, once you involved in a, you know, a fractur side of incident
[00:50:39] where a bomb was dropped onto your location. Can you give me a brief of us on that one?
[00:50:46] Yeah, I, I blame myself for that one a day. So we were at Shawwallycott, 20 kilometers north of
[00:51:00] Candehara, which was our, our operational objective. We had to take Candehara from the Taliban.
[00:51:04] The religious center of gravity. It was more important to take Candehara than it really was
[00:51:11] to own Kabul or Harat or MES, you know, Majar Sharif, because of the significance of it.
[00:51:18] And we had one presidential mission. And that was to determine whether the cloak of Muhammad
[00:51:25] in the mosque in Candehara was still there because it was a huge concern in the, in the Muslim community.
[00:51:34] All, you know, all the way back to Mecca, right, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, this was a big deal.
[00:51:40] And so, you know, we, we were doing combat operations for three days north of here. I mean,
[00:51:49] we had to go through a pass in this pass at high ground, it was a bridge. It was a, it was a,
[00:51:54] it was a, tortured front and it was very well defended by the Taliban and al-Qaeda. And they
[00:52:01] weren't given this ground up very easily. And we were doing combat operations, leading patrols,
[00:52:08] trying to disrupt them. We were, we were engaging them with, you know,
[00:52:16] you know, F-15s and so on, so forth. And it was going pretty, you know, it was going real well.
[00:52:22] And we were getting people that were switching sides, you know, Afghans that were coming
[00:52:27] on the side and they were given us great intel on stuff, which is always shocking for Americans to
[00:52:32] hear about people switching sides. And it's very common, especially in the Arab culture.
[00:52:40] And I know that there's a, I want to say this is an Osama bin Laden quote that, you know,
[00:52:45] the, the people are going to bet on the winning horse. So basically, if you're strong and you're
[00:52:49] winning people were like, okay, that's who we're putting our money on. And so this was what you were
[00:52:53] seeing on the ground was as the coalition grew and as cars I got more people, people are looking
[00:53:00] around going, he's got more people. And they, it's almost like a mob mentality of joining, joining
[00:53:05] that team. Oh, absolutely, and absolutely. And, you know, required flexibility and adaptability
[00:53:11] on our part. And I know, I know Colonel Fox was just never real comfortable with it. All right,
[00:53:16] Don, where did all these people come from? And I said, well, sir, they came, they came from overnight.
[00:53:21] And they came from over there. And he goes, these guys were fighting us. And I go, oh, yeah,
[00:53:26] they were fighting us. And now they're with us. And we got the, you know, they're all vouched for
[00:53:31] because, you know, all this is my cousin. This is my brother. This is my, you know, and so hey,
[00:53:36] all right. And, you know, we got the Sard and Major telling us, you know, it's okay. And then we got,
[00:53:41] you know, Elvis going, thank you very much. Thank you very much, you know. So he, you know,
[00:53:47] and he goes, and we're going to arm him and give him bullets and everything. And I said, well,
[00:53:50] yes, there we are. And he goes, oh, Jesus. So he was never really quite comfortable with it.
[00:53:58] And he goes, he goes, you're, you're good with this. And I said, hey, sir, but I don't know if we have a choice
[00:54:04] number one. But yeah, I'm good with it. You know, I grew up in a small town in New Hampshire. And I can
[00:54:11] see the same thing happening there, you know, people sitting on the fence, you know, historically,
[00:54:17] we've seen that, you know, where the passive people start joining the people that are winning. And,
[00:54:23] you know, before that, they're passive and now they're active and, you know, vice versa. So,
[00:54:30] yeah, I think, I think we'll be okay, right. And, uh, it's all right. I'm coming for you, though,
[00:54:37] if you're wrong. I said, all right. That's fair. That's fair. So anyways, we, we're doing this,
[00:54:45] and it's about 830 in the morning, and we get some good intel, and, you know, we get with cars
[00:54:50] eye and we get a good decision from him, and we start, um, we start our operations up. Well,
[00:54:58] we had a very, very good process for clearing our fires. We had a great STS guy on the ground.
[00:55:07] And we have absolutely no errors. And we, we needed to build up our four structure going into
[00:55:14] F, going into Candahar. So, we took this point, we took this point time to bring in some
[00:55:23] additional, uh, augmenties, right. And it was about 24 hours before this had happened. So, what we did was,
[00:55:33] we, um, we did a good transition with everybody. We had a tack pee come in and he did
[00:55:41] good transition with the STS and learned all the SOPs and everything like that. And RSDS guy in the
[00:55:48] tack pee had, uh, changed over. So just so everyone knows these, these are the guys that
[00:55:55] call for fire from the air. That's where it talks about. And the tack pee in the STS, these are
[00:56:00] individuals that are trained. That's what they do. It's, I mean, obviously it's a really hard job.
[00:56:05] One mistake can be deadly, and that's what they're focused on, and it's great to have those guys,
[00:56:10] because that's what they do for a living. Right. And so you had a transition taking place where you're
[00:56:15] going from one guy that had been with you. Now your, your force is glowing. You got some extra guys
[00:56:20] that are going to be able to help out, but they're just showing up. So they're not quite up to,
[00:56:25] to up the speed yet. That's correct. That's correct. And, um, and so they did their transition.
[00:56:33] And we had got a mail in for the first time. So guys were, you know, guys that weren't directly
[00:56:41] involved in doing anything were opening up their mail. And, you know, I had done a walk around
[00:56:47] our defense of area, which was an old Soviet mortar pit right up in the high ground. And I had
[00:56:57] walked around and I had gone down the hill, just got to the bottom of the hill and this big explosion.
[00:57:07] I don't know where. And, um, I don't know how much time had passed to be honest with you,
[00:57:15] but I picked myself up off the ground. I had pieces of body parts, stuff all over me,
[00:57:23] blood all over me. I'm doing a quick assessment of myself. I got a real bad injury with my leg.
[00:57:32] And, um, you know, days looking around and it is utter mayhem.
[00:57:42] We got Afghans down, we got Americans down, we got rounds, cooking off, we got RPGs, cooking off,
[00:57:50] it's going all over the place. I start walking around, I start grabbing our guys. We go down to
[00:58:00] where Karzai was and we made sure he was okay and he was with his CIA guys and they had secured him.
[00:58:08] And the guys that were with him, securing him, I asked them if they would go out and reconnaissance
[00:58:15] and they placed the bringing helicopters because I knew we were going to have to cast a vac here.
[00:58:21] And, out 200 meters we had casualties, right? It was a mess. All 20 of the U.S. guys on the ground
[00:58:30] were injured some way or another, some more than others. And, we had designated a casualty control point
[00:58:44] and I got with my cons guys and we had to find some, we had to kind of like, take cons equipment from,
[00:58:55] you know, cannibalize it from other stuff to make the reestablished communications with higher
[00:59:00] headquarters. I found Colonel Fox and he was, he was dazed and confused just to the point where
[00:59:09] he was just not coherent about what was going on so made sure that he was taking care of.
[00:59:15] And, I went up on the hill and we started pulling bodies off, right? All these rounds
[00:59:22] cooking off and everything like getting guys off to top of the hill, getting him down.
[00:59:27] And we knew we had to get complete accountability of everybody.
[00:59:35] And, we did that and I was missing one, right? And, I went back up on the hill to where his position was
[00:59:44] and that was ground zero with the impact of the 2000 pound bomb from a B-52 of 35,000 feet.
[00:59:53] And, I searched everywhere and I found his hat and I took his hat and I started picking up
[01:00:09] bits and pieces and I put it inside the hat and I put the hat inside a bag and I marked it
[01:00:15] and that's how he was identified. But there was nothing to send home, absolutely nothing to send home.
[01:00:22] And, another one of our guys that was killed was completely torn in half. I found him under a vehicle.
[01:00:30] His chest was still heaving, his legs were over here, his chest, his body was separated from it.
[01:00:38] And, I started doing CPR on him and someone finally grabs me on the shoulders and goes, sir.
[01:00:45] No, it's not going to work. He's torn in half. So, anyways, we'd get him in a body bag and we
[01:00:56] get him off there and then we had one guy that was not going to make it, but was still alive and we kept
[01:01:04] him alive and we got him EVAC when we had coordinated EVAC and we got a B-Team special force
[01:01:15] this company and an ODA to come into back fill. That came in from higher headquarters. We got all the guys out
[01:01:23] and then we started doing the after action in regrouping because we still had this was five December.
[01:01:32] We still had to go and take Kandahar. So, me, my assistant S3, the batang commander and a comical guy
[01:01:46] despite our injuries we stayed on the ground in order to be able to coordinate the push to Kandahar.
[01:01:53] So, we did that. We regrouped. We got as many afghans out as we possibly could that were injured.
[01:01:58] That wasn't something that higher wanted to do but we talked them into doing it because it was
[01:02:05] the right thing to do. So, we got our afghans partners, we backed out. We helped with the casualties
[01:02:13] for them as well in the village and everybody came out and helped from the different areas around the village.
[01:02:19] We just said screw it. We're going to hit that bridge. We're going to hit that pass and
[01:02:34] we're going to knock them out of there and we went through. Nobody was there.
[01:02:41] This was eight December and we went right into Kandahar and we took Kandahar and
[01:02:47] the after action on that though. I blame myself to this day. Transition between the STS and the
[01:02:56] tech P was really good but the tech P had to change batteries and those old soft lamps that we used
[01:03:07] to target designate. When you do that the grid resets to your position. So, before you send
[01:03:14] anything or confirm anything with the aircraft you've got to make sure that you have your grid
[01:03:21] system squared away and that was the mistake that was made. As I go over this in my mind over
[01:03:30] an older and older and older, you get even to this day I think to myself. I should have been there
[01:03:34] to make sure that I should have got an in person briefing from the tech P that he knew all those
[01:03:48] procedures. I should have got that and I didn't get that and because I didn't get it,
[01:03:55] because of we're in combat and because of all the things that you talked about earlier.
[01:03:59] You know, the mistake was made and I was in charge of those operations on behalf of Colonel Fox.
[01:04:08] I was my job and I didn't do my job in my opinion to the best of my ability and we had that event
[01:04:14] occur and I learned a big lesson and I'm sure a lot of people were in a big lesson but at the end of the day,
[01:04:29] there's a, and I think you talk about it and you're booked there at extreme ownership
[01:04:35] the fog of war and and clause widths and his explanation of the fog of war and I mean it's all there
[01:04:41] right and you do what you can do in some cases you can only do so much there's a lot of things going on
[01:04:50] but in retrospect it becomes clearer and as you say you got to take extreme ownership
[01:04:57] not only on those things that go well but most importantly on those things that don't go well
[01:05:03] at what point did you realize it was a the friendly bomb?
[01:05:06] Well, it wasn't until I was talking to the tack P who was seriously injured and he was apologizing
[01:05:23] and he said I said I made a mistake I don't think that I I cleared that grid like I was supposed to do
[01:05:33] and I said hey listen mistakes happen these things happen please you need you need to
[01:05:44] focus on keeping yourself I mean he was seriously and you need to focus on keeping self alive
[01:05:50] so you can get home to your family these things happen don't blame yourself now I know to this
[01:05:57] day because I've spoken to him quite a bit you know the burden that he carries but at the end of the day
[01:06:11] fog of war mistakes happen so leadership responsibility but it wasn't until then that I realized
[01:06:19] oh crap we got a we got a friendly fire incident here and so when the investigation team came
[01:06:29] down to investigate we were already in candle hall and we were already set up but we had already written
[01:06:36] our statements and you know I had a pretty good packet form knowing you know anticipating what was
[01:06:40] going on and I think you talked about that in your book as well you know one one friendly fire
[01:06:45] incident okay let's we know a whole bunch of shit's gonna come rain and down on us so let's get ahead of the
[01:06:52] power curve and let's make sure that we find out what went on and we tell the truth and we get the
[01:06:59] accurate assessment of what went on and when we came down and and it was Brigadier General Burford
[01:07:06] he was the deputy commander for U.S. Special Operations Command he's won the came down and led the
[01:07:14] investigation and sat down with his team we said this is what we got we got him out to the spot so we
[01:07:20] could see it and you know we gave him we gave him a you know a good briefing on on that and what we
[01:07:26] were doing and how we were doing it and we had taken that soft lamb and we had isolated it
[01:07:32] it had been damaged but nonetheless wasn't being used anymore and so we had everything for him
[01:07:39] and an in a nice rack and and I go hey listen this is a combat environment you know we don't want to
[01:07:45] we don't want to have them come down here and have to expose themselves to danger here while they're
[01:07:50] doing their investigation but at the same time we want to make sure they get to where they need to go to
[01:07:53] do a thorough investigation and and the most important thing is lessons learned so this never
[01:08:00] ever happens again right and I tell you what nine more rotations never happen to me again
[01:08:08] never happen in the unit that I served in again because we made sure that you know those kind
[01:08:15] of lessons were applied and over and over and over again right yeah when I took over the training
[01:08:20] for the west coast seal teams like the tactical pre-to-planet training I would put those guys
[01:08:25] in positions all the time and they would every single group every single two every single
[01:08:29] troop every single task minute they'd get a blue on blue and I'd sit down and say I want this to happen
[01:08:36] here so you realize how it happens so it doesn't happen overseas like it did to me so that's
[01:08:41] the best thing you can do is take those lessons learned and and spread the word so it doesn't
[01:08:46] happen again I can tell you that there's still still guys on that ODA there's there's all three
[01:08:54] of the guys that we lost still blame us still blame the chained command from that
[01:09:00] right and that's okay I take that responsibility fully I accept it and I understand where they're
[01:09:11] coming from and that's just that's hopefully it has made me a better leader right as a result
[01:09:23] and what else am I going to do right except acknowledge it and you know move forward because my
[01:09:31] responsibilities in leading didn't end as a result of that yeah yeah and I mean even to those
[01:09:39] those guys that were lost and God rest their souls but at least they're the lessons that were
[01:09:46] learned from that horrible as they may be at least there's you know as you said no operation that
[01:09:53] you oversaw after that ever had another incident so their sacrifice saved lives and I know that
[01:10:00] horrible in one way but it's the truth it's also the truth it's also the truth and yeah I didn't
[01:10:06] never had another blue one blue incident and the as a tying commander as a siege so to fake commander and
[01:10:15] as a general officer level commander and Afghanistan and combat never ever had another one and
[01:10:22] you know we attribute that to of course the experience of the guys as we go through but most importantly
[01:10:28] you know leadership and learning they're indispensable right and so you got to you got to move forward
[01:10:37] and that's what we did so so you guys rolling to can to hard and it's pretty much no factor
[01:10:46] there's like what was the resistance level rolling to can't are the resistance level was minimal we got
[01:10:53] ambushed going in and you know we took care of that and we kept going we get to the Mula Omar's
[01:11:03] compound and it is there are vehicles everywhere covered with mud because that's what they did to
[01:11:20] try and hide from our aerial observations right they covered their vehicles with mud they saw predator
[01:11:27] right so we we said and that was a way for us to identify if they were if they were bad guys are good
[01:11:35] guys because the bad guys were covering their cars but here it is again I looked at you I looked at
[01:11:41] Colonel Fox and I said hey sir look we're parking lot full of bad guys and now they're on our
[01:11:48] side right and he goes I don't get this this is so and then we went to the jail and we brought John
[01:11:55] Mohamit that John Mohamit was a very very close friend of Karzai and he had been
[01:12:00] imprisoned by the Taliban and tortured for very very long time and he became the governor of
[01:12:07] Ervour's gone and he got up there and he met with Karzai and and this is a guy that I developed
[01:12:13] a very good friendship with over the years no matter what job I had going back into Afghanistan
[01:12:21] in his mind I was the commander of all special forces right I just what's not and I would tell
[01:12:29] him I don't hey listen I'm just a baton commander here I just got these guys he goes oh no no no
[01:12:34] you are the commander of all special forces and he would tell people that and it would get in the
[01:12:39] news right and and I'd get a phone call and I go I didn't tell him that right and so yeah I knew
[01:12:45] his guy and you know what he's like a commander of all special well he was he was a wild man always
[01:12:52] had been a wild man if there's one guy that you wanted him because or his gun province was you know
[01:12:57] I mean it was full of Taliban it was full of okay and we needed to guy like that to go up there
[01:13:01] and you know a clean house but the way he was cleaning house in the way that you know it was acceptable
[01:13:08] in the international community was two different things and so we had to keep it very close to
[01:13:14] I don't that but nonetheless he gets there and he goes all right I'm going to need some furniture
[01:13:24] so he starts going in the rooms and he starts going I want that I want that I want that and he goes
[01:13:30] into Moola Omar's office and I wasn't with him but one of the guys was in there and he comes
[01:13:38] running over to me and he goes sir you got to get over here he goes the guy that we just let out a
[01:13:43] jail he's going to the bathroom on top of Moola Omar's desk and I go what and I go in there and he left
[01:13:55] a mess on top of that desk and that was his just what he felt he needed to do and then he told
[01:14:06] Karzai I'm on my way to Orr's gun province when I get the Tarenk out of Lichko, Lichino and
[01:14:11] we'll start clearing that place out and you know Karzai put governors in Orr's gun province is a
[01:14:19] bull province for our province, Nimru's province, Helman province, Helman was the one that we got the
[01:14:27] largest number of Taliban al-Qaeda and operational Russian equipment out of and we had to negotiate
[01:14:35] that right we had to negotiate that with the Taliban leader there that you know he would you know he'd
[01:14:40] be free to go off and do whatever you wanted to do and you know Karzai said I don't care and
[01:14:46] Sharzai was the governor of Kandahar now the governor of Kandahar is the senior governor in the
[01:14:55] South that just how it works and we'll do a lot of power even though you have governors and all
[01:15:01] the other provinces so he pretty much laid down the law and you know organized things and slow
[01:15:08] but surely you know I started seeing security and Southern Afghanistan just you know shape up and then
[01:15:16] and how long did you stay in Afghanistan for for that first rotation from November to March and then
[01:15:28] the so you left in March of 2002 right had the governor's been put in position yet
[01:15:33] oh yeah they were all position in December yeah so at that point there's a pretty good
[01:15:39] it looks it's looking pretty good at this point it looks real good it looks real good they're doing at the
[01:15:43] Afghan way and and the airfield in Kandahar was something that we wanted to secure
[01:15:56] so that we could you know use it to bring in and bring out you know supplies and stuff like that so
[01:16:05] general Madness one star general at the time the Marines got that mission and so
[01:16:15] their operational area was was really confined to Kandahar airfield and then we had
[01:16:22] the Siege's sort of north up in Uzbekistan and then then Commodore Harwood came in to do
[01:16:33] Siege's sort of south Kandahar and he works side by side with with General Madness
[01:16:41] and we were in Kandahar and our soul advise in assistor responsibilities centered around
[01:16:54] Shurzae at this time because Karzai had gone up to take to be the interim prime minister
[01:16:59] up in Kabul and so everything that we did we did through with and by
[01:17:05] Karzai or Shurzae in coordination with Siege sort of north who was see-towing us and then
[01:17:14] Commodore Harwood who was see-towing a separate direct action unit out of Kandahar airfield
[01:17:24] and we got this taskless from from Siflek right the combined forces and it was it was a three-star
[01:17:34] headquarters right and so it was about 180 different places they wanted to go to
[01:17:42] and that was our task to to go do that we had to get that done so when you say go to what
[01:17:50] do you mean go to like they thought they thought it was places that had intel or had bad guys in it
[01:17:56] and all under 180 of them were dry old like towns villages are like actual target packages
[01:18:02] targets without the target packages it was just a little station and we think there's something there
[01:18:08] but the places that all 180 of more dry holes but the places that we got all the computers and all the
[01:18:16] stuff that that some of them loud was working on and we'll all my was working on we're given to us
[01:18:23] by the Afghans that were on the ground hey they worked out of that one they worked out of that
[01:18:28] they worked out of this and and we would get a calls and hey we got LK to there see that's where it
[01:18:34] became tricky because Taliban were Afghans so you get them and they either switch sides or they
[01:18:41] didn't switch sides right and if they didn't switch sides well you know the you know Afghans you know
[01:18:48] would would deal them through Afghan wall right and custom whatever LK to different story they were
[01:18:54] Arabs and oh we had to be very very careful because there was only one fake for them if they
[01:19:01] gotten the hands of the Afghans who had been family said been killed and tortured so on so forth
[01:19:10] and they didn't have any real love for them right so that was a whenever we got a report in
[01:19:16] sands and the Zalkate s expected LK to guy we would go boom and we would take we would take them
[01:19:27] into what I would call protective cops there right and then we would move them by our own means
[01:19:33] to be interrogated and by you know coalition side of the house right and so I mean that's that's
[01:19:43] kind of difference between the Taliban and LK at the time they're on the ground and how they were
[01:19:50] just you know dealt with differently and we didn't really worry about the Afghans because they
[01:19:56] always switch sides but it was the it was the LK because they were from Oman they were from Saudi Arabia
[01:20:03] they were from Pakistan they were from some other place right and not well but no they were not welcome
[01:20:11] and you know one of the worst places to go when we first got there was the soccer field because
[01:20:20] that's where all the hangings the headings and the stoning of women took place I mean stoning women
[01:20:27] and and the killing of children for flying a kite we handed out thousands of kites when we got
[01:20:34] down there because they're huge kite flying folks they have competitions you know where they
[01:20:39] tack each other with the kites you know it's just like this huge thing anyways they loved it right
[01:20:46] we got them their music we got them things to play with their music we established businesses one of the
[01:20:52] one of the first businesses that we established was a woman's laundry and then we used it to clean
[01:20:57] our own stuff because by the time we got the time we got the time we got the candahar we stumped right
[01:21:04] I mean it was pretty bad so anyways we did that but I'll never forget I was on it was
[01:21:10] four o'clock in the morning I was up on the candahar governor's mansion and I was doing my
[01:21:17] had my night vision goggles and I got my afghan partner with me and to keep them awake I
[01:21:22] had do was give them the goggles because it was like it was amazing to them right it was amazing
[01:21:27] to see that technology and they could see because they'd go and then you go back down right
[01:21:31] and I know you can't see me on the radio but I mean it you know it's just is what it is but
[01:21:37] I'm up there and I see the bakery that we had established you know and the guy goes in for work
[01:21:44] and he gets in there and he starts opening up and that's where we got our bread every morning and that
[01:21:48] man bread that football shaped bread it was warm it was delicious by that time we were getting peanut
[01:21:56] butter and jelly sent to us and my wife sent me a tub of marshmallow because I'm from New Hampshire
[01:22:01] and fluffing outers are really good right peanut butter and marshmallow sound so I was looking
[01:22:06] for it to it but I'm watching this guy and I go oh there he is you know doing his thing we
[01:22:13] he starts you know he gets the dough all done and he gets in the bowl with his feet
[01:22:21] and starts kneading it and I'm like no I did not just see that right you can't unsee that and I'm like
[01:22:32] and I know what his feet look like right and I'm thinking to myself it's gone I can't eat bread again
[01:22:42] and we go get the bread and I'm sitting down and the time commander sitting there and watching the
[01:22:48] guys and I go all right guys I gotta tell you I gotta tell you this is what I saw today
[01:22:55] I gotta share this with you I hope I don't ruin it for anybody more morally obliquid
[01:22:59] I gotta share it with you and I did and they looked at me and they go I don't give me
[01:23:07] I'm eating this bread and it goes the brick oven burned it all off and I go I can't get there
[01:23:13] I can't get there right so it kind of ruined it for me but anyways it's good
[01:23:21] so by the time you leave for the first time in March you know it it looked like things are going
[01:23:26] pretty as good as you could want them to go 2002 when do you get back there again
[01:23:33] so you know it was interesting I get selected to be the fifth special forces group S3 so I get bumped
[01:23:41] up from the batai and go up to the group level and we're now of course
[01:23:48] sustaining operations while it had gone to a different group so we didn't have to worry about
[01:23:54] Afghanistan anymore at fifth group because we didn't have really there because it was third group
[01:24:00] but then we got the warning order for Iraq so we start planning Iraq and then I get called into
[01:24:07] my group commanders office he says hey you just got by name requested to go do an interview
[01:24:15] to be the secretary of the army's aid
[01:24:20] oh joy I go sir I just got the job that I've always wanted
[01:24:25] group S3 I mean they didn't get any better than that in a special forces group right and in my mind anyways
[01:24:32] and I was like sir I don't I don't want to do that and he goes well you don't have a choice
[01:24:36] and he goes and you better not blow it because we need an SF guy at that level it's never happened
[01:24:43] before so we need you there right we need you there so you go there and you do the best you can
[01:24:48] if you don't get picked don't worry about it but don't sabotage it so I go there and Tom White
[01:24:56] is a secretary and I do my interview and I'm sitting at home and I get a call
[01:25:04] Tom White don't you're gonna be my aid we got two weeks together here
[01:25:13] and I go holy crap so I call my boss and I tell him he goes you know congratulations it's
[01:25:19] great it's gonna be great for the SF community blah blah it's funny because the entire time I was
[01:25:26] the aid there I never got a call from the SF community once but I did what I was told to do and I
[01:25:33] went there and I was the aid for Tom White and what a great experience that was what I wanted you
[01:25:38] to do it for what a great one year so you get right and then you move on and then so that's what
[01:25:46] year was that that you were the aid 2000 June a 2002 to June a 2003 got it right and then
[01:25:56] I went what did you before you jump in and where you went next what did you you said it was a great
[01:26:01] experience I was fortunate enough you know as fortunate as you can get would you become an
[01:26:07] aid I was fortunate enough to be the aid for for the seal Admiral Admiral Maguire and definitely
[01:26:13] was loved yeah he's a great guy great guy but I was very lucky that I was able to do that job
[01:26:19] because I got to see a lot and got to understand what was happening and understand how these high
[01:26:24] level decisions were made and see a little bit into the future what was it from from your experience
[01:26:28] what did you see that what did you learn that was important well all of what you just learned
[01:26:34] but more importantly I learned how all the you know how these decisions have made inside the
[01:26:42] the political level right from the top and all these things that are done so when I got back
[01:26:49] to the tactical level I could explain to the guys what's going on at the strategic level and although
[01:26:55] although they may not like it at least I had a familiarity and an understanding and be able to
[01:27:02] explain what's going on in the whole process and why we're sitting here you know waiting to be
[01:27:08] ordered to go do something or what would have you but I learned how the army worked
[01:27:13] sitting in the hello and a lot of us go through help there's a lot of guys that get promoted to
[01:27:19] general officer and they don't even know how the army works right because they've never been in a
[01:27:23] job that taught him how the army works it's just a matter so you know there I am you know I'm
[01:27:29] the you know battle buddy of the secretary of the army you know and he depends on me for everything right
[01:27:36] and and it was just a phenomenal opportunity to learn how the army works and how the army fits
[01:27:45] into the larger service and how the joint chiefs of staff works and you know how all these things
[01:27:51] go and and so you know I did not want to leave the group S3 job at all I just you know I
[01:28:01] didn't want to and when I got asked the question by secretary white you know do you want to be
[01:28:07] they you want this job and my answer was sir I'll be honored to serve as an aide but
[01:28:15] I'd rather be this special forces group S3 to heck and I was told later that's why I got the job
[01:28:23] because everybody else they interviewed wanted to be they and I didn't so they gave it to the guy
[01:28:29] that didn't want it and and I went there and I gave him 100 100 100% like I would do any job
[01:28:37] if they made me the floor sweeper would be the best man swept for an army right that's just the way
[01:28:43] it goes right you just go do whatever job they give you and do it best of your ability and then you
[01:28:47] know you know good things will happen and so I did that and then I went over to I got picked up
[01:28:56] for lieutenant colonel and I got picked up for tying command first battalion third group and I had to
[01:29:03] do some joint time so I went over and I worked for I was the executive officer for the assistant
[01:29:08] secretary of defense for special operations of the intensity conflict so then I got to see how the
[01:29:14] OSD worked and how all of that went and I always like to say how it works and doesn't work right
[01:29:21] because it's both sides of the coin right but it is good excellent experience and I met some really
[01:29:26] great people there that I have relationships with to this day but that was three June of 2003
[01:29:41] and then I went and took command of fifth special forces group first battalion third special
[01:29:48] forces group the desert equals and we did two back to back tours to Afghanistan there
[01:29:53] and that was that was awesome one of the only battalions that ever did back to back tours
[01:30:05] it's just the way it worked out so we went there for nine months came back for six went back
[01:30:10] for another nine months and then I went up to use the socket for the the amount of continuity you
[01:30:17] know it's one thing that when you compare let's say world war two with either the end of
[01:30:23] Korean war or the Vietnam war where you have guys coming on tour they're gonna do a year and then
[01:30:27] they're gonna leave and that's that's that's almost a continuity when you do nine months there
[01:30:35] six months home and then nine months back there you start to get some real continuity what what
[01:30:40] did you see in that deployment or those two deployments you get to see like a bigger arc of the story
[01:30:46] yes with with a better thread through it so we really saw the the reemergence and the
[01:30:54] resurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in 2005 when we got there may have 2005 is when we got there
[01:31:02] now now obviously 2003 I think I might have cut you off when you were about to say this before but
[01:31:08] 2003 things are looking about as good as we could hope in Afghanistan the war kicks off in Iraq
[01:31:15] that means people are you know American soldiers resources are now pouring into Iraq that
[01:31:22] sort of becomes the focus and and that allows over in Afghanistan where we had had a big presence
[01:31:29] now something that's drawn down now the sudden the you know al-Qaeda and the Taliban start to see
[01:31:35] opportunities yes and so when you roll back in it's now 2005 and now they've taken advantage of
[01:31:42] some of these opportunities they have taken advantage of the opportunity and I'll never forget
[01:31:49] September 11th 2005 I was on a hilltop with Charlie Company commander and in the
[01:32:02] Kandahar province and there were 1500 wave after wave of Taliban fighters coming at us it was unbelievable
[01:32:23] September 11th 2005 that was I had been you know I mean 2011 I mean September 11 2001 that long ago
[01:32:36] right and you're right I mean we had it looked good in 2002 2003 and four we didn't have the
[01:32:47] resources that we needed but we were still doing nation building we were still building an army
[01:32:52] we were still building the police we were putting together there justice system we were putting
[01:32:57] together there constitution so on so forth all that was working but there wasn't anybody to keep
[01:33:03] the pressure on them right and so they researched and so we saw the front of that and Kandahar province
[01:33:11] in 2005 September 11th Operation Ladusa and you know it was a big operation and it was just
[01:33:29] it was just unbelievable what was going on during that time frame in terms of you know enemy
[01:33:34] capability capacity strength numbers and it wasn't just southern Afghanistan which is where my
[01:33:42] batay it was it was in the north it was in the east you know predominantly at that time in the
[01:33:48] east we were on the border right wow that was just incredible right so we're going on all over the place
[01:33:55] right you know when when you talked earlier you mentioned that you know we were helping them
[01:34:00] we were right in the constitution we were setting up the government and there's a you know when
[01:34:05] I talk about leadership a lot which I do I talk about what happens when you try and impose your plan
[01:34:11] onto your subordinates onto your team you impose your plan onto them look you can kind of get away
[01:34:18] with it sometimes depending on the authority that you have depending on the amount of leadership
[01:34:22] capital that you have depending on how much oversight you're allowed to kind of sit there and
[01:34:27] if you're going to impose their plan the plan on them and then you have the tenacity and the
[01:34:33] ability to sort of continue to put the pressure on them then maybe maybe you can pull it off
[01:34:40] but it's much better from a leadership perspective to say hey Don you know here's this mission
[01:34:45] how do you want to do it and kind of let you come up with the plan it seems like America has a
[01:34:51] tendency to want to impose you know our way onto countries whether it's Vietnam or there's
[01:34:59] the Vietnam thing the way that unfolded and the way we tried to sort of impose what we wanted it to
[01:35:06] look like and the Vietnamese don't like that they they they've fought against that forever and they've
[01:35:15] never been beaten and so they weren't going to be beaten and and it wasn't that they didn't like
[01:35:20] what we were saying it's just that they wanted to say what they wanted to say so so you know here we
[01:35:26] are with the Afghans so doing a little but doing some imposition on them and and the way that
[01:35:33] turns out it's sort of like from a leadership perspective if you don't have the the constant pressure
[01:35:37] to say nope nope I this would exactly what I want you to do and I have the the tenacity
[01:35:42] and the leadership capital and the resource stuff kind of make you do it which again this is an ideal
[01:35:46] mm-hmm how do you think we find ourselves in a situation where we we seem to make that that seems to be
[01:35:53] our tendency to want to impose our our way our plan onto other under other people mm-hmm
[01:36:01] well to your point I mean it doesn't it doesn't work out well right and and the way we had set it up
[01:36:06] there was the US who's doing the military the Germans were doing the police the Italians were doing
[01:36:14] the justice system and then there was this collective body that was writing the constitution
[01:36:22] and we factored out one of the most important things that goes in a constitution or a
[01:36:29] or a document whatever they choose to call it that establishes their their government and how
[01:36:35] their government is going to govern in a Muslim country and that is they don't separate church
[01:36:40] and state right and that was one of the big mistakes of that document right and then we name the
[01:36:47] government for them as well which you know they didn't like either so once they got it turned over
[01:36:55] to them they made you know cars I went in they made they made the changes right and we were building
[01:37:00] a top-down western government police and military force which isn't culturally the way they do things
[01:37:08] it's very decentralized very decentralized and we're trying to centralize it was trying to
[01:37:13] centralize it from cool down and they don't do that either you know their political system
[01:37:19] is very democratic to begin with it's it's sure is in jurgers and it's local and it's consent
[01:37:25] among the tribal elders and the village elders which are which are different right because you
[01:37:30] have the tribal elders and they may not be the elected village elders right but they still work
[01:37:36] together and they understand and then they have a pecking order of the tribes and so when
[01:37:42] stuff goes when stuff is available the tribes get their fair share based off of where they sit
[01:37:49] in the pecking order and they're okay with this but we don't like that a lot of times right
[01:37:54] because we want the the minority want to get the stuff but they're okay with the stuff they get
[01:38:01] because it's good enough right so we went in and we mocked all that up right because we would just
[01:38:09] start familiar with the tribes and it's a lot of try to idealistic about the way we think things
[01:38:13] are going to be I remember a very similar example we had these young Iraqi soldiers and the officers
[01:38:20] were skimming their paychecks and you know my guys coming to me there they're you got their
[01:38:25] skimming the paychecks of these young and listed guys so I started talking to my interpreters
[01:38:30] and I go hey what's going on can you help us you know if I want to understand what's happening
[01:38:33] he's like of course they are he's that the soldiers know that that's that's that's that's
[01:38:38] their boss and he's going to take a little piece that's the way it works that's that's that's fine
[01:38:42] so us going in and trying to impose what we have this ideal of the way things should be
[01:38:48] doesn't always match up culturally in the turns into a problem yes and that's exactly what
[01:38:53] you know I mean the same thing happened in Afghanistan right and we were obligated to fix it
[01:38:58] which puts us in a position we don't have any real authority to fix right I'm going to
[01:39:05] listen to us there's still going to skim it there's still going to do the thing they'll just figure
[01:39:08] out a different way to do it and although we see that that is bad I'm not saying it's good I'm
[01:39:13] saying it's just the way it is right and over time these things will change like we saw
[01:39:20] in Afghanistan right now the ambassador to the United States and Afghanistan is a woman
[01:39:26] never would have been that way in 2001 or five or ten but in 20 it's a woman that's great that's
[01:39:35] progress they'll figure it out right they have a great university system that they figured out
[01:39:42] and it's one of the things we really didn't get involved in and it works right and I don't mean
[01:39:49] that that everything we did was terrible because obviously it wasn't but when you start getting
[01:39:55] involved in a country's institutions and you start getting involved in their culture and
[01:39:59] their society and your outsider it's never going to be received well and you're probably going
[01:40:04] to you know trample of or something that you should just you know just stay away from but
[01:40:10] the good things will happen as they you know continue to move forward and another thing
[01:40:17] that a lot of people in the villages they didn't want to go from the seventh century to the 21st
[01:40:24] century right they didn't want to they were very happy being in the seventh century you know
[01:40:30] one of the things that I would always tell folks that would would come to you know to do
[01:40:35] humanitarian work in Afghanistan I say don't give them coats don't give them shoes they don't want
[01:40:41] that all they're going to do they're going to smile at you they're going to say thank you so much
[01:40:46] they'll even have kids running around with this stuff on but as soon as you leave kids are taking
[01:40:51] it off putting on their sandals you know they wear sandals you know even in the winter time right
[01:40:57] they're not going to put on winter boots they're just not going to do it but they're going to take
[01:41:00] those winter boots and they're going to put them on trucks and they're going to go to pack a
[01:41:05] stand and they're going to sell them and then they're going to come back home because they don't have
[01:41:09] any use for what they have use for paper pencils and school products and things along those lines
[01:41:15] that they that they will use and they won't go sell because they want their kids to be able to draw
[01:41:21] they want their kids to be able to get right they want them to be able to you know so stop giving them
[01:41:27] converses sneakers you know it's they're not going to you know they're not going to wear
[01:41:33] I mean I'm not going to see basketball quitch break out you know they want soccer balls
[01:41:37] and they'll play soccer barefoot and they'll outrun us right and they're bare feet so let's just
[01:41:44] you know I think it's you know to your point right I mean it you know it kind of is it's kind of
[01:41:50] is what it is and and our guys would see it because our guys would stay there and you know
[01:41:57] all the boots and the shoes and the jackets and you know they don't wear hooded sweatshirts you know
[01:42:04] give them blankets right they're not going to sport a hooded jacket with a hood on it in the middle of
[01:42:10] the Afghan villages they stick out like a sore thumb it's not what they wear right so you know
[01:42:17] they like cooking equipment you give them cooking equipment they make a great stew you know
[01:42:25] you might pay for it for a few days if if you eat it on our stomach right and the other thing
[01:42:31] that we were doing was we were introducing medical supplies that were causing more harm than good
[01:42:37] because we needed the medical supplies because the way we grow up and live in America
[01:42:45] our immune system is much different than what they look and I used to tell stories I used to tell
[01:42:51] a doctor we'd get an Afghan in with a head injury right now bullet wounds through the head right
[01:42:57] and the guy he's expecting and I go oh no I wouldn't be so sure please don't call him expecting
[01:43:03] this is an Afghan they have incredible healing um did you just the way it is I get a call from the
[01:43:09] doctor the next day hey don't you know we're going to believe this the guy's sitting up
[01:43:14] spouting all kinds of things and you know post to and I go of course he is he's an Afghan
[01:43:19] yeah you know that might have put down an American soldier but not an Afghan that's just the way
[01:43:26] they are so please you know I used to go over when our when our Afghan partners would come in and I
[01:43:31] would make sure it's a please and I'd have my medics there and I'd say just watch this guy
[01:43:35] because they're going to say expect it and we know that he might not be sometimes yes most of the time
[01:43:42] no and you know they just have a different constitution because of the way they have to you know
[01:43:53] operate and if we bring in all of our amenities we weaken them and we make them more susceptible
[01:44:02] to getting sick and and dying yeah it's not their their way of life it's not their way life and
[01:44:08] and they don't want it right you know they do have their idea of of medical care so don't exceed it
[01:44:16] right just come up to it bring it back bring the doctor back back bring the nurse back bring
[01:44:22] those skills back that the Taliban had a trip down to nothing and that's what they need so those
[01:44:31] so those two deployments back to back that's 2000 was it was a 2006 2007 so it was 2005 to
[01:44:39] six and six to seven yeah and those so what type of operations or your guys doing because
[01:44:46] now you you were the batit first batit commander of third special for what what operations were you guys
[01:44:52] were you guys doing so we were doing we were assisting the Afghan National Army at the time with you
[01:45:00] know shaping and clearing operations right and then we'd want to put we'd want to hold that area
[01:45:10] in a way that we hadn't been holding it before so we introduced kind of the hold because it used to be
[01:45:14] shape it go clear it and then leave and then they'd come back in so let's hold it let's figure out
[01:45:19] away to hold it and that's where the first ideas about bottom up security came into play in 2005
[01:45:30] six and seven so you're you're setting up uh where was it Afghan police was it local police idea
[01:45:37] of Afghan local police right came in there and at that time we were just calling them in the
[01:45:42] Arbachai right and we had the support of the had Arbachai means like security local security
[01:45:49] yeah it means their local security so like back in the day when they were fighting
[01:45:55] Alexander the Great and Gangas Khan and the Brits and the Russians the Kabul the King of Afghanistan
[01:46:05] wouldn't send down national troops to deal with the problem he would organize local arbachai
[01:46:14] and the village elders and the tribal elders they go and they get their weapons out of their
[01:46:18] you know um out of their huts and they mud huts and they would come and they would report
[01:46:24] and they would defend Afghanistan and that's how they would do it yeah there's so many similarities
[01:46:30] you know from from my experience and I rack and and in 2006 and in the city of Ramadi the
[01:46:37] when the the army came in looked the army worked hard they when they I racky army came in
[01:46:44] they worked hard they they sacrificed greatly they fought hard they were a bunch of shea
[01:46:51] going into a Sunni city and that right there you're already starting off on the wrong foot I mean
[01:46:57] and that's not even put it that's putting it extremely mildly to say you're starting off in the
[01:47:01] wrong foot you you're deal with people that have a history of killing each other and so you got the
[01:47:07] strong shea army coming into the Sunni city and look the Sunnis inside Ramadi realize look
[01:47:15] the their after al Qaeda their after these insurgents their after these foreign fighters so we were able
[01:47:20] to to get through it but it wasn't until the the the the Suns of Iraq and the Iraqi police the
[01:47:30] local the local Sunni tribesmen tribal leaders the sheaq said you know what we want to defend
[01:47:36] our own city let us put our tribe let us put our tribesmen in the police force that's what we did
[01:47:41] and then it was a game changer because now you had the local tribal leader had his tribesmen
[01:47:47] with police uniforms on authorized by him saying yep we we don't want bad guys here and the
[01:47:54] local popping is going yep that's that's our tribe and there's several tribes there multiple tribes
[01:47:58] with they all agreed that that's what needed to happen so this idea of you know decentralized command
[01:48:04] but also this idea of hey the people that are on the ground that are from there they know who's
[01:48:10] good and who's bad and the local populist is going to support the neighborhood kids that are now
[01:48:15] neighborhood police and that's just it's it we were lucky enough to kind of watch that unfold
[01:48:22] I was lucky enough to watch that unfold and and see those the what they called the Suns of Iraq
[01:48:27] and it was interesting too because in Iraq there had been there had been out in al-Kaim the Marine
[01:48:34] Corps had pushed through al-Kaim and when they did it there was a bunch of locals going hey there's
[01:48:38] bad guys in that building over there there's bad and so the Marines said hey you know what let's
[01:48:42] organize these guys and they made this this thing called desert protector which was hey if you're
[01:48:49] a local and you want to help us out cool you can join this program called desert protector and they
[01:48:54] started to send it was working pretty well well when Maliki got elected all of a sudden he
[01:49:00] looks out an al-ambar province and they got all these desert protectors out there and he goes
[01:49:05] way to second now I got a bunch of random rogue security forces running around I can't have
[01:49:12] that I can't I can't have that so he shut it now which which was not a great move but you can see
[01:49:19] from his perspective he doesn't want a bunch of rogue paramilitary units run around but we were
[01:49:24] able to convince the the shakes in Ramadi because they were asking we wanted you to desert protector
[01:49:29] we want to do that we were able to say look at we we can't do desert protectors not around anymore
[01:49:33] but you can be Iraqi policemen you can be local and we'll help you train and that's what we did
[01:49:39] so what you're talking about it's very similar very similar yes yeah well you know I mean as you
[01:49:47] point it out the the cultures are you know very similar in the way they approach things and there's
[01:49:53] the principles that really work and apply from one place to the other the techniques
[01:49:59] and the tactics and the approach might require adjustment but nonetheless standard principles
[01:50:06] remain the same and that's what you're talking about and I think that one of the biggest
[01:50:14] things that we saw in 2005 to 2007 was that this brought about I'm up approach has merit over
[01:50:21] a top down approach right although there are aspects of the top down approach that you still need
[01:50:26] to apply but really if you're talking about security and safeguarding
[01:50:31] population and making that area in area that the enemy can't operate in that's going to be
[01:50:42] the way that you need to go and from 2007 to five to seven we learned that but the other thing
[01:50:47] that we learned was during this time frame you know the US you know transitioned the mission to
[01:50:56] NATO and that's when it became a full fledged NATO operation and a very good friend of mine
[01:51:02] Dave Frazier who's written a book about Afghanistan at about his time they're during this time
[01:51:06] took over that's when they went from 06 as curdles and in some cases navy captains commanding
[01:51:17] the regional commands you know north southeast and west in Afghanistan to general officer level
[01:51:24] headquarters and Dave came in he was a Canadian special ops guy who I had had a relationship with
[01:51:31] really really good guy and when we got into Afghanistan he said hey I need to come over here I
[01:51:41] need to talk to you about you know what we're going to do and how we're going to do this because we
[01:51:45] got a problem and more than we came in here to do peacekeeping operations and although it's
[01:51:54] not popular thing to say my assessment is is that we're fighting an insurgency and a deadly one
[01:52:01] and he knew that that was our assessment as well our intel guys and everybody had the same assessment
[01:52:06] going in there from first to time third group and our group headquarters up north so
[01:52:13] anyways he called me in and we said well I think we can come up with an operation using the afghan
[01:52:25] national security forces to come up into this district panjouay and take over this stronghold of
[01:52:33] insurgence right and so we went back we did some planning we came back and briefed him and so what
[01:52:42] Charlie company first battalion got the mission and it was a instead of coming at them from
[01:52:53] you know uh can to heart province you know directly or helmet province where they expected it
[01:52:59] to come we went all the way down south into the red desert which is the red desert now when you fly
[01:53:06] in southern afghanistan and you're flying you know east of west or west to east there's the
[01:53:15] red desert that heads all the way down into Pakistan and it's nothing but desert and then there's a
[01:53:21] distinct line that goes into the built up areas in the green areas and so on and so forth and it's just
[01:53:27] so blat nobody goes down there only better ones go down there so we did our infiltration and
[01:53:35] a panjouay district that way it took three days we did vehicle recovery operation I mean it was ugly
[01:53:42] right but we got there and completely surprised the Taliban in panjouay and it was a huge victory
[01:53:50] so we brought it them up and then my guys were up for over 96 hours straight me and my command
[01:54:02] started major went in once we took panjouay district and this is where I told you earlier we got
[01:54:09] up on top of the hill it saw all the Taliban coming it was unbelievable well anyways once we
[01:54:15] got control that situation our guys my those guys had in slept for 96 hours and I called my
[01:54:21] headquarters and I said how I'm going to stay son major and I'm going to stay here overnight so
[01:54:25] canceled the CH47 coming again us and so we did that and I knew if I had told my guys that
[01:54:34] the sardine major and I were going to pull the entire night shift so they could sleep I would have
[01:54:40] got a bunch of pushback right no sir you're not going to be pulling guard right now yeah I would
[01:54:45] so I just kept my mouth shut and I said hey I'll take first watch they go oh you don't have to do that
[01:54:50] and I go now I take first watch well these guys went down hard and the sardine major and I just stayed
[01:54:55] up all night well about two o'clock in the morning my company commander Jared Hill comes out he goes
[01:55:01] sorry what that's going on it's two o'clock in the morning I was supposed to have shift you know I
[01:55:06] slept through what I'm sorry I go no no no we got this go back to bed we're good and he didn't
[01:55:12] argue with me went back to bed and none of them had to pull shift it was just me and the sard
[01:55:23] major and we did radio watch and did the whole thing if we called in all the all the times right
[01:55:30] and then that was that and these guys got up not only did I have that but I also had the helicopter
[01:55:39] come in with hot chow right hot breakfast right and so I said you guys get your hot breakfast
[01:55:48] and the sardine major and I will hand it back over to you and you know you got it right and
[01:55:53] you know it was just amazing what these guys had done general Fraser and his book writes
[01:56:03] today about our guys and he says they saved the NATO mission because if we didn't have these
[01:56:12] special ops guys to do this we would have been routed by the Taliban and it would have been a
[01:56:20] huge political nightmare for NATO. First Battalion third group my guys got awarded for the first time
[01:56:32] the equivalent of the Canadian presidential unit citation the only foreign military in the history
[01:56:42] of the Canadian military to get that award and they got that award and it sits in the
[01:56:46] battalion headquarters at Fort Bragg proudly and you know they sent down their equivalent to their
[01:56:54] chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to Fort Bragg and all the guys got it penned on him it took him
[01:57:01] four years to get it approved but he didn't quit and he finally got it approved and I was I was just
[01:57:08] getting out of the work college at that time was 2009 when they when they did the award and I was just
[01:57:14] so proud to see these guys get the award and do they're thing but yeah it was I mean and that that's
[01:57:24] really what kind of got us thinking and you know who got thinking general crystal and when he came in
[01:57:34] in 2010 to take over he was all about bottom up all about it and then when general portrays came
[01:57:42] and it take over for him oh he loved village stability operations in Afghan local police and
[01:57:50] so when you before we get into that so you get done with your Battalion Commander tour
[01:57:55] 2007 something like that yeah July 2007 and he changed command and then you go to work college
[01:58:02] yeah I go up to use the sock headquarters from basically August to May of 2008 and I get selected
[01:58:13] for the work college and I go off to the work college but another great opportunity when I went to
[01:58:22] our three star headquarters which is a place nobody wants to go but you know you go there I got put
[01:58:30] in the to be the deputy G8 and the deputy what the G8 does in that headquarters is they do
[01:58:38] they do all the combat developments and the resources and the budget and you know all that stuff
[01:58:45] and I so I learned that and then I learned how use the sock not only fits into so calm
[01:58:51] and how we compete for resources there but also how we compete for resources in the army
[01:58:56] and how our tier one guys how they get all their resources and how the Rangers get all their
[01:59:03] resources and everybody and so that was huge right and so I was right in the middle of that process
[01:59:09] because we were right in the middle of of doing all of that for the next five years
[01:59:16] and I got put in charge of the movement of seventh group from Fort Bragg
[01:59:25] to Destin Florida for their new headquarters and setting that up and what that would look like
[01:59:32] and although not perfect we really really did create an optimal special forces group headquarters
[01:59:44] with all the Rangers and all the things associated with so they could do all the levels of training
[01:59:50] right there and what you learn about working with communities and briefing communities because there's
[01:59:55] noise things and noise studies and this that you know housing issues and you know is there going to be
[02:00:02] enough housing you know houses all going I'm you just unbelievable right so that was another part you know
[02:00:08] like I told you before with the secretary of the army and then working at ASD and then the joint staff
[02:00:14] and all that all coming together really gave me tremendous insight on on how use of sock
[02:00:21] you know United States Army special operations command works and again a lot of guys
[02:00:27] that make very senior ranks don't have any idea how that works because they don't get the
[02:00:32] opportunity to go there and that was because I come out of the time command I get selected
[02:00:37] for the work college and it's like oh now what the hell we're going to do right and no place for me
[02:00:42] right and they said report to use the sock headquarters and they'll have a job and I originally
[02:00:49] was going to be in the J in the G3 but then I got stuck I got moved over to the G8 because an old
[02:00:55] boss in mind was the was the use of sock G8 Jeffrey puts and he goes oh no I want him right
[02:01:06] he's a fine boy he gonna work his ass off for me right and and he may not like it but he's going to do it
[02:01:12] and so boom so I went there and yeah I was great great really great experience
[02:01:17] and then would you study a war college so I went to the war college and I just studied that you
[02:01:23] know they're curriculum and you get a master's degree in strategic studies so I was like oh this
[02:01:28] is great right so I I've worked at the strategic level right and three different assignments
[02:01:35] and I've worked at the operational level and now I'm going to go and I'm going to get an education
[02:01:40] and the in strategic studies and so it really it it brought together the job experience and
[02:01:49] then an education and kind of mesh that together for me I got a business degree when I went to
[02:01:58] Commander General Staff College because I I'm like you know what when I take over a unit
[02:02:04] it it can't shoot move and communicate like nobody's business right but God do we suck at
[02:02:13] admin budget you know all that stuff that nobody likes to do and they're not comfortable doing it
[02:02:18] so I ended up you know I got a business degree because I thought that that's what officers do right
[02:02:24] and so learning how to run a business I said you know that's going to help me out and it did right
[02:02:31] and so I had the business thing going for me and then I had the you know got to the war college
[02:02:38] Carlisle and and that was just a great experience there as well and but I learned one thing
[02:02:48] at the work college it's not necessarily the war college and what you learn there it's winning
[02:02:53] the gym thorp sports event where all the war colleges come to the army war college and you compete
[02:03:03] right in a variety of different sporting events and the army is only lost at twice
[02:03:14] who do they lose in their history of they usually you lose it to the navy war college
[02:03:20] for the what are the events the national war college their teams are so small right
[02:03:28] because the school is so small they get their butts kicked all the time but the army war college
[02:03:34] and you know you got the army the air force the navy the coastguard academy you know you got
[02:03:40] all those guys that come down and it's a it's three days of feats of strength right
[02:03:46] you know I loved it and and you you play all these sports right during the war college
[02:03:54] only so that the coaches of the different teams in the gym thorp sports competition
[02:04:01] can draft their athletes and then you start training in January after the first of the year
[02:04:11] you get put on a team and then you train all the way up to uh may when they have the event
[02:04:21] what what what event did you do I I was in the uh 800 meter relay and the five mile run
[02:04:31] and we won both those events we had a ringer we had a
[02:04:37] uh some guy with a 357 mile or something we had a a guy on on our team he was a Marine on our
[02:04:47] relay team who was a you know division one relay national champion yeah on a team right and so
[02:04:58] about fair and and our coach was in the 1972 Olympics as an 800 meter relay and so the coach
[02:05:11] you know so he taught us you know how to run you know and and how to pace yourself and how to do it
[02:05:16] yeah it was a blowout it was pretty cool but I had the um
[02:05:23] leg that I had I had the first leg yeah that's right I had the first leg he even knew how to set
[02:05:29] up people for the what legs and you know and he stood right right at the place and he said turn it
[02:05:35] on so as I ran by he goes turn it on and it was you had so much left in you right even though I was
[02:05:42] last I picked everybody off right and that was the whole idea of it because people don't get trained
[02:05:47] and how to run it they just go you know and two laps around a track yeah you know you're gonna start feeling
[02:05:54] it you know no I the 800 which I never did but I was reading an article about it somewhere along the way
[02:06:01] and the 800 they say it's like the most painful event because you know you're running 100 yards it's over
[02:06:08] you run you run a mile or a 16 or even a marathon it's at a lower level of intensity
[02:06:16] he and this this article that I think I think it was an article I read but it pointed out the fact that
[02:06:21] there's zero recreational 800 meter runners they don't exist there's marathon there's people run
[02:06:27] marathon there's people do a little sprint triathlon there's no one that just guts through
[02:06:32] 800 meters like for fun it doesn't happen all right so we wrap with the gym form
[02:06:40] championship and it's time for you to go back to work and your next your next thing is you go back
[02:06:47] you go back to Afghanistan again I do I go back for Afghanistan again what proved to be 22 months
[02:06:54] and this is what 2010 2010 and I go back to Afghanistan as an advisor to the RC South Commander
[02:07:05] and at the time it was a Dutch commander by the name of major general de Croife and it was a Dutch guy
[02:07:15] and we were having some general McCristal was concerned about the problems with soft coordination
[02:07:23] so he said hey you're going to take command of siege sotofe so the siege sotofe that's the
[02:07:30] that's a combined joint special operations task force afghanistan this is the first thing that's
[02:07:34] going to be in charge of all special operations in Afghanistan that's correct and you get you get
[02:07:39] tasked with that outside of the tier one guys yeah tier one guys not included so
[02:07:49] anyways we uh I'm going to take command of that that's going to be my brigade level command
[02:07:55] opportunity and I couldn't have been more excited I have Admiral Olson
[02:08:00] and general kerni to thank for that they're the ones that pick me so I was
[02:08:10] had a great relationship with Admiral Olson and general kerni general kerni was then the deputy
[02:08:17] the deputy of socom but before that and during my time as a retired commander he was the sock
[02:08:26] special operations command central commander is a two star so that's how I built that relationship
[02:08:31] with him and general Olson or excuse me Admiral Olson develop a good relationship with him and so they
[02:08:39] picked me for that command but there was some time there so I went to uh I said hey I'll just go early
[02:08:47] right and I'll you know do whatever you need me to do I'll work on a staff I'll do whatever
[02:08:53] you know pick staples out of the rugs I don't care just you know just get in there early and
[02:08:58] get myself you know ready for you know the command and they said hey general McCristal wants
[02:09:08] to go down south and be the special operations liaison to general de kroyce who was not very happy
[02:09:20] about the coordination with his headquarters in RC south and the soft guys so I went down there
[02:09:28] and I got myself established and did that well the interesting thing is general de kroyce went to
[02:09:33] the army work college and there's twenty seminars in the army work college and you get assigned in
[02:09:41] seminar and there's a twenty first one and that's for all the guys deploying out of the war college
[02:09:51] whose family stay right so my wife was in seminar 21 when I left she stayed right there which was
[02:09:58] great continuity for her and the kids because they were there my kids wrestled so one of them
[02:10:05] wrestled for the high school so they were that was just good continuity and we thought it was only
[02:10:11] going to be for here but it ended up being for twenty two months so they ended up staying there
[02:10:17] almost three years which was really good for them but general de kroyce went to the war college
[02:10:22] and he was in seminar eight and I was in seminar eight and we called ourselves the eight balls
[02:10:28] and so when I went in to introduce myself and he said where you're coming from when I said
[02:10:31] the war army work college you go so I went to the army work college too and I go really that's
[02:10:36] great sir I mean I loved it and he goes oh I loved it too I was in seminar eight and I go well
[02:10:43] so was I and he goes no way and and we had the same instructors the same guys there so we were
[02:10:50] able to share that we were able to share stories about Piano and eight ball right and it was automatic
[02:10:55] you know relationship establishment were born everything and so all I did was go to his morning meetings
[02:11:05] be available for him whenever he needed whenever there was operations coming up I made it sure
[02:11:11] that they would de-conflict it and I ended up traveling with him everywhere he went and I've can't
[02:11:18] understand on his plane everywhere he went in the south that's what he wanted me to do and it was
[02:11:27] it was like simple and general my crystal was happy because he was not getting any more
[02:11:33] complaints from the RC South commander and you know and they were valid complaints I might say right
[02:11:41] I mean you know how that goes it's just so much going on right and everybody's trying to do the
[02:11:45] right thing and they're trying to get it done and you know things slip so they got 06 now you know
[02:11:52] a kernel there to make sure that doesn't happen and if it does happen he got 1 god of blame mate
[02:11:57] what else so it was good and you know we just tighten that up and you know it wasn't just soft you
[02:12:05] know it was conventional side it was all kinds of you know everything's going to the state
[02:12:09] department and what they're doing and then the you know other things going on so hey it just worked
[02:12:15] and how long did you do that for I did that for six months let's see from June to
[02:12:25] yeah June to December six months and then after that you took over the CG sort of yeah I went home for two
[02:12:31] weeks for a break in nice vacation yeah two weeks one home for two weeks came back
[02:12:36] took command and stating command of of the special operations there you know the CG sort of
[02:12:46] a until May of 2011 and this is when you started or at what point did the the VSO the
[02:12:57] village stability operations start at it was it at this time yes so because I remember I was
[02:13:03] getting ready to well I retired in 2010 and I was I was running training and as I was running training
[02:13:11] we were starting to have guys do training missions based on VSO based on going out and doing
[02:13:18] tribal engagement and key personnel engagement and going to meet people and villages and
[02:13:22] have on them how they're going to set security and all that stuff we started doing that in 2010
[02:13:26] so I don't know exactly when it came came to fruition but from when did it so it would have been
[02:13:35] about April of 2010 okay that it all started coming to fruition because I got there in 2009 I
[02:13:44] did that then I took command yeah June of 2009 and then I didn't leave until May of 2011 right
[02:13:52] so it was it was about that time frame and you know it was a it was a collection of people
[02:14:03] that were you know putting this together but I happened to be the commander that did the bulk of
[02:14:09] operationalizing it which is the hardest thing to do right the first guy in the breach right
[02:14:14] you know it's it's hard because you got people pushing back against it and you got people that are
[02:14:21] all for it and you know even though general crystal wants it to happen you know there's there's
[02:14:26] many people there with them that don't want it to happen and you got the international community
[02:14:31] and and even my own community right they were skeptical of it because they saw it as a special
[02:14:40] forces mission so bringing in Marsauk and bringing in the seals to do this kind of mission
[02:14:46] they were like hey that's not their mission and this is a bad precedent and this that
[02:14:49] you know thing and I'm like hey but you know okay so give me more ODAs right I mean you know
[02:14:56] I came up with a term and the joint staff because everyone was using the word fungible right
[02:15:02] and I happen to be given somebody a brief right and and it was about using special ops and you know
[02:15:09] we're better when we work together right because we have just we just aren't right so anyways
[02:15:14] I said and you know special ops puts the fun in fungible you know because that was the big
[02:15:23] strategic word at the time right and so the more you could show you were fungible the better
[02:15:29] off you were so we're fungible is hell right and and that's what that's what we do so
[02:15:34] so anyways we yeah we we just you know came together and did it and every single
[02:15:46] whether it was Marsauk whether it was you know their teams or the Navy seal teams or the
[02:15:53] special forces teams these platforms did really really well and just give us a quick brief on the idea
[02:16:00] of of the VSO of the of the village stability operations what was so if if I was an ODA team leader
[02:16:06] I was a seal platoon leader what was what was my mission what was it gonna look like so your mission is to go
[02:16:12] is to go into say it's you know can't do hard province and it's a district X and you're gonna go in there
[02:16:20] and you're gonna figure out what is the best village to start a village stability platform
[02:16:26] which consists of your team and additional augmentation of intel guys and you know there's
[02:16:32] things that you're gonna need in order to be able to operate there you're gonna go in you're
[02:16:36] gonna talk to the village elders and the tribal elders and you're gonna figure out where you need to
[02:16:41] be now they're gonna tell you where you need to be and you're gonna go with it and if it's the wrong
[02:16:47] place don't worry about it we can change it so just just go with the flow just go in there
[02:16:54] there in charge there the guys that are gonna tell us where to go and over time you'll figure out
[02:17:01] if it's the right place or not and then working with them if you got to change the place you
[02:17:05] don't want it because what's gonna happen is there are of this top-down mindset okay the US is coming in
[02:17:11] and they're gonna come in with a whole bunch of good stuff and we're gonna be able to take it
[02:17:16] advantage of it while they're gonna realize over time we're not coming in there with Jack
[02:17:20] right yeah just go talk to the audience and see if the dudes are out there in the middle of nowhere
[02:17:25] that's right and so some hasco barriers and if we can sack common attention have fun boys
[02:17:32] right and we're not coming in with a with a big bag of money and a whole bunch of things that they're
[02:17:36] gonna be able to you know take advantage of and then they're gonna realize wow hold the crap right
[02:17:41] and but what we are gonna do is we're gonna come in with the ability to be able to prove to them
[02:17:46] that they can secure themselves and we'll develop this Afghan local police program and they're in
[02:17:52] charge and nominating the people for this program so we we get their fingerprint their thumbprint
[02:17:58] on that guy and so if that guy does something it discredit the village elder and the tribal elder
[02:18:04] so you're not gonna really get back it now did we have some problems yes we did but the problems
[02:18:10] were my new and we started we started clearing these you know clearing and holding these areas
[02:18:19] and with the Afghan local police program and yeah and it's based more on relationships that you
[02:18:26] form with the locals more than it's based on imposing your will of the locals which you can only
[02:18:35] do that if you've got the strength and the consistency and to do that all the time right which is
[02:18:41] it's impossible it's impossible it's impossible and so some of the challenges that I was presented
[02:18:46] with was hey you're putting these guys in in harm's way they're gonna all get killed one night
[02:18:53] the Taliban is just gonna overrun them and I said well I don't think so our guys are smarter than
[02:18:59] that they're not gonna allow themselves to be overrun they're gonna keep their finger on the
[02:19:03] pulse on the intel we're gonna use the relationships that they have in the post-tune wall
[02:19:08] we code and people kind of laughed when I said post-tune wall it could be a post but it is strong
[02:19:12] you know and it consists of you know supporting strangers it consists of revenge right and
[02:19:22] that's what they basically operate off of and they accepted us in and we became their responsibility
[02:19:31] and as a result of becoming their responsibility anything happened to our guys
[02:19:41] now did we get guys injured and did guys get killed yeah but that was in combat operations
[02:19:45] and they died right along with us right the just combat operations and combat operations but
[02:19:54] did we ever get overrun no and this was in the middle of the time where you saw conventional
[02:19:58] outpost being overrun right and you know all over Afghanistan and this is conventional units
[02:20:05] that put themselves in valleys in in places that they shouldn't have put themselves because
[02:20:13] they were operating independently of the the Afghan cultures protection right and so
[02:20:22] ended up by 2011 when I left we had 90 locations and none of them ever got run over none of them
[02:20:35] ever got attacked the Afghans were all over I mean they knew they never lost a fight against
[02:20:41] the Taliban they were protecting their families and they took it seriously and when they saw
[02:20:47] the progress they were making and this big bad Taliban guy was defitable and they saw
[02:20:56] they were like whoa then they got the will to fight and they had the mission and they realized
[02:21:01] that their freedom and their destiny to live life the way they wanted to live was in their hands
[02:21:07] and that they didn't need the American military or international forces to secure their
[02:21:13] freedom for it they could do themselves but we need you help a little bit right we need you help a
[02:21:19] little bit but when we got it we got it and that's where the transition piece came in
[02:21:24] yeah it's interesting because you know I was saying that not only can we as Americans
[02:21:31] impose our will on every village in the country guess who else can't do that let's tell
[02:21:36] it about that right so so if you got it you got to make those connections it's decentralized
[02:21:41] command it's building relationships and had a pretty positive I mean a very positive impact
[02:21:46] on what was happening in Afghanistan 2000 was at 2010 2011 into 2012 and 13 things are moving
[02:21:55] in the right in the right direction right and you know like I said General McCristal put it in place
[02:22:01] he was replaced by General Petraeus and General Petraeus became a huge huge advocate of this
[02:22:09] and one of the things that General Petraeus did was he said don what do you need to expand this
[02:22:17] and I said well we're kind of limited sir with just our special operation forces
[02:22:23] but if we could get augmentation from the conventional forces
[02:22:29] then we could expand right and we could we could use the conventional forces to augment
[02:22:36] and not as guards for our bases because we don't need those we got the Afghans to do that
[02:22:41] but just as additional people and we can train them on how to do it but and then we can
[02:22:47] expand ourselves because we have we have a little bit more people but not too big because we can't get too
[02:22:51] big because then that that gets out of it so he went to the army and got us a battalion
[02:22:57] all right and we used that battalion to augment not every team but certain teams in certain areas
[02:23:10] and it allowed us to expand faster and one of the one of the areas that we needed to do this was
[02:23:16] Kona right and we brought in a guy by the name of Jim Gantt who had relationships with the tribal
[02:23:25] elders out there both in Pakistan and in and in Afghanistan and we gave him the village stability
[02:23:34] operation mission now Gantt worked for me when I was a battalion commander he wrote a paper that
[02:23:41] General Olson or Admoles and really loved in Soty Petrayus and Soty Dovers and they asked Scott Miller
[02:23:48] who was my boss one star then two star Major General Miller who was my boss during this whole time
[02:23:55] and who I worked through in order to get you know village stability operations in Afghan local police
[02:24:01] started and he was pretty brilliant and you know how he got that approved through Karzai and so on
[02:24:07] so forth because everybody was in the international community was very concerned about oh you're
[02:24:13] gonna arm all these guys and then they're gonna create all kinds of humanitarian violations
[02:24:18] are gonna kill people you know Karzai was worried that they would get too strong and take over the
[02:24:25] government you know when you go down there at that level they didn't have those they didn't have
[02:24:30] those aspirations they wanted to control their village they just wanted to live control their village
[02:24:35] have their family get their family educated bringing their crops to market and let
[02:24:43] them right and not have anybody bothered or they they had they had known this is how I need to take
[02:24:48] over Afghanistan because they saw a couple is as big a problem as anything else right so
[02:24:57] yeah but there's people that live in Montana and Wyoming that don't really care what's going
[02:25:04] in Washington DC and they certainly don't want to move there they don't want to move to New York
[02:25:08] they don't want to move to LA they they just want to live in Iraq's exactly and so same
[02:25:14] principle applies and so you know they you know we you know we we took advantage of that and it
[02:25:22] cost us one eighth the amount of money that it cost to make an Afghan police officer or military officer
[02:25:32] or Afghan police officer or army and you didn't need big garrisons right and they walked to work
[02:25:40] so there's no infrastructure right and the ultimate decentralized commander right it really is
[02:25:46] and and you know it was working and they could sustain it you see it wasn't anything they
[02:25:53] couldn't sustain in the long run so and every place was different you know if you saw one
[02:26:02] village stability operation and one Afghan local police in a village well you only saw one right
[02:26:10] because they're all different right and they're different because you know different people are
[02:26:18] making it work right and the tribes are different and the ideas are different you go up north
[02:26:24] and terrains different the way they're making a living is different yes everything's different so
[02:26:29] you've seen one you've seen one so there there there there isn't this there isn't this like
[02:26:35] you know magic formula where you you know you got one and you take that one and you impose it over
[02:26:42] here no all different right and what I really liked was we carved this up into Marsaucterator
[02:26:50] into naval special warfare territory into special forces territory and I would get the same
[02:26:55] guys back all the time right they would they would come in for the six months they would out rotate
[02:27:01] out in the six months and we got that kind of continuity right and we weren't reinventing the wheel
[02:27:08] where you know special forces are coming in it happened every once in a while and I remember
[02:27:15] when I took command a siege of Sotifei we were coming up let's see this was April I said hey listen
[02:27:22] I walk into this headquarters and I see all these liqueens and chewys and all this all these condiments
[02:27:28] and ice cream and all this other stuff and I go hey fuck guys on the ground can't have this
[02:27:34] one on having and that's just the way it is right and let's talk about Thanksgiving and let's
[02:27:40] talk about Thanksgiving right now let's April if they don't get turkey we don't get turkey right
[02:27:48] and we had the technology we had refrigeration units we could put out there not not tax anything
[02:27:56] we had stuff that would run off of with those panels what am I having so we're paying
[02:28:03] solar panels we had all kinds of stuff and we could you know there was all kinds of innovative ways
[02:28:10] that we could get turkey out to them now some guys get the frozen butterballs they put them in the
[02:28:15] freezers and they were good to go but what about those that we couldn't get that stuff out to
[02:28:20] well I had this I looked at Ron Reagan my my a log guy and I said hey you got to make this happen
[02:28:27] and he goes all right we'll get it happen so Julia Furman at the time at a young lieutenant
[02:28:34] log officer comes up with this plan and she goes sir we got it think we're going to be able to meet
[02:28:43] your intent for Thanksgiving and I go all right well let's let's get it operation turkey drop
[02:28:50] and our our guys figured out how to drop live turkeys in and I said okay is this going to be
[02:29:02] cost prohibitive or what and they go oh no it's it's great we we do it with the normal runs but we just
[02:29:08] you know we got our own shoots we pack our own stuff we've done several rehearsals we haven't had any
[02:29:16] misfires so I'm not going to get in trouble with pita by dropping in a turkey and the turkey you
[02:29:23] know the parachute doesn't you know I was just kidding of course and and so we did it we did
[02:29:29] operation turkey drop we got them out there in September all the turkeys because we had to drop
[02:29:33] grain and feed and you know we had tell them how to take care of the turkeys and so they did it
[02:29:39] and on Thanksgiving day I got all kinds of storyboards right of these guys eating their turkeys
[02:29:45] everyone's happy our guys are happy because they get turkey and all the fixings went out there with it right
[02:29:50] I mean boxes of stove top stuff and then you know all that good stuff right and so these guys are
[02:29:57] eating that stuff well come January I happen to roll out to our one of the marine attachments out there
[02:30:05] and at the time the young captain there was the son of the common don of the Marine Corps
[02:30:09] and I was going to go out to see him and I land on the ground and dust settles and the next thing
[02:30:16] I know I got these two humongous turkeys on each side of us and I go with the heck of these guys
[02:30:23] doing out here and he goes because all those are those are our turkeys you know I go these
[02:30:28] are the same turkeys that we've dropped to you and he goes yeah yeah and he wants to get off the
[02:30:35] subject as fast as he possibly can't but these turkeys are snuggling up right next to me and he told
[02:30:40] me what their names were you know they're true and yeah and I we continue to walk and we close
[02:30:46] to we get to the rains the turkeys break off and they go into this tent that's got and I walk over
[02:30:52] the and they go no no no sir it's this way and I go no I'm going to see what the turkeys are doing
[02:30:56] the farmer and me is now very interested so I go over to see these turkeys and they got this like
[02:31:01] they got they're hooked up they got hey and you know placed to eat drink and tables that they
[02:31:09] jump up on and all these things and I go what's going on he goes he goes oh sir and he's looking
[02:31:16] down at his feet he goes the guys they got the turkeys out here they named him the guys just fell in
[02:31:24] love them and they couldn't kill them and I go you steal the eyed marine special operator
[02:31:29] just couldn't take two turkeys down for Thanksgiving we couldn't do it and I go all right this is
[02:31:36] great and I said hey I don't blame you you know I I get it and but he goes you know the afghan
[02:31:46] are waiting for the day they're waiting for the day yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:31:51] and so a special forces ODA which I was getting my point is we didn't always have the
[02:31:58] flexibility of replacing marines with marines and so on and so forth but SF ODA gets out there
[02:32:08] and that next Sunday I got a story board and they're eating the two turkeys they didn't have the
[02:32:14] same connection with those turkeys and the afghans the cooks they're all smiling you know they got
[02:32:23] there you know they're all happy but anyways then sir you were in that tour for 22 months you're
[02:32:32] over there in afghanistan and then what what what happens when you get no without so I get done
[02:32:37] with that and they say hey you're gonna go to the joint staff and you're gonna be the deputy
[02:32:42] deputy special operations guy in the joint staff and I'll be working for General Magata
[02:32:53] now the the the the VSO idea seemed to have faded and and lost some of its steam not so much
[02:33:04] from what was happening in the field but it seemed like we went in a different direction
[02:33:08] mm-hmm yeah what what caused that well when I got back so I went to the joint staff
[02:33:14] reported there in June of 2011 worked on the staff and there was emphasis taken off of
[02:33:23] village stability operations in afghan local police from 2011 to 12 but I got told hey you know
[02:33:34] General or Admiral McCraven was now the so-called commander and General Allen was the commander
[02:33:44] in afghanistan and they wanted more emphasis placed on VSO so I got told that I would be going
[02:33:51] back in June of 2012 to June of 2003 it's gonna be a year anyways and they said hey and
[02:34:00] Tony Thomas was gonna be the commander there to start commander and I was gonna be the one star
[02:34:05] sipsock a commander with the portfolio for VSO L.P and I'll think of his name as we go but
[02:34:16] Air Force one star I was still a Colonel I hadn't come out on the O.O. seven list yet
[02:34:23] but the one star was gonna work as a deputy for General Thomas and he was gonna do all the
[02:34:33] direct action stuff mm-hmm so two portfolios one commander bringing soft under one command
[02:34:40] and you know Tony Thomas got that and so we went in there under that construct and and I was
[02:34:50] told get this back online get it expanded yet so we did that and by the by June of 2013
[02:34:59] 90% of the 90% of the rural area was in the control of the afghan government
[02:35:13] and it was due to village stability operations afghan local police and
[02:35:18] we started doing transitions so we were transitioning to the afghans they had put a
[02:35:27] General Ahmed Zai became my battle buddy and he was in charge
[02:35:33] of the afghan local police for the minister of interior and and so he was my battle buddy and I
[02:35:44] worked with him to ensure that he could he understood and could implement this mission everything
[02:35:51] from you know making sure they got the training make sure they got the weapons make sure they
[02:35:55] got the oversight make sure they got you know they're doing everything they possibly can and it was
[02:36:00] integrated into the afghan government fully and 100% and we were out and we had this on a timeline
[02:36:07] that took us out about you know 2015 maybe 2016 and we would had completely transitioned it and by that
[02:36:13] time nearly 100% of afghan understand would have been fully another control of the of the afghan
[02:36:19] government the Taliban at the time were saying more done al-Qaeda out no they were completely
[02:36:29] ineffective again same thing I was talking about earlier they don't have the they don't have
[02:36:33] the resources to be in every single village and get down to some local village with 280 people
[02:36:40] in it and and put the resources against it to get control of it and it's always better will on it
[02:36:47] and meanwhile the locals obviously they live there not going anywhere and there's more of them
[02:36:52] than there are the Taliban capability built to do it so it was you know it was just
[02:36:58] who's heading in a good direction was heading in a very very very good direction and so
[02:37:04] you know by by the middle of by the middle of 2013 and everything was you know falling into
[02:37:13] place to where the afghans and none of the things that they said you know it wasn't a perfect
[02:37:20] perfect program but what program is perfect it was good enough right and it was working
[02:37:26] and a lot of the things that people really had a problem with just didn't happen right the
[02:37:34] humanitarian you know incidents didn't occur to the extent that people said they were going to
[02:37:41] occur and the you know cars I was not concerned the afghan local police were going to form
[02:37:49] you know a huge militia and assault Kabul it's just one gonna happen right all these things that they
[02:37:55] at the political level they were really nervous about just didn't happen and so I mean it was good right
[02:38:04] and then you know it's it's it's 2013 and people are wondering hey you know when we're going to
[02:38:09] get out of there and so you know the political stuff started you know filtering in afghanistan and
[02:38:15] and you know the ideas of pulling out and so on so forth by 2014 and transitioning
[02:38:21] to non-combat operations coming out of the villages and stuff like that and so we tried to influence
[02:38:31] that the best we could with you know Rand studies and showing them that hey if we just keep this for a
[02:38:38] couple more years you know it's gonna be solid and the chance for resurgence will be way low and I mean
[02:38:47] look what we've done in terms of the dropping casualties you know lowering a casualties a record
[02:38:54] lows record highs and security the Taliban are pretty much slapping the table on defeat alkate
[02:39:02] is like hey we can't operate here anymore and that had a lot of due at the top down stuff going
[02:39:07] on too because you needed that right so you know the tier one guys weren't involved in the village
[02:39:12] stability operations afghan local police but what they were doing to take out the senior
[02:39:17] guys was obviously complimentary right so this was good this was a good balance and it was
[02:39:24] soft was in a good place where we were all working together and we were doing a variety of
[02:39:31] different missions along our very broad mission continuum and it was way less expensive than
[02:39:39] sending over a division or a brigade to do it right you know did it keep soft busy yeah it kept soft
[02:39:46] busy but you know I mean in a productive way and the guys saw it right I mean not everybody
[02:39:54] you know even our guys weren't in love with the mission first you know I mean you talk about it in
[02:39:58] your book you know about having to explain the guys that it's gonna have to be an Iraqi solution
[02:40:05] of this right and we're gonna have you know and it was the same challenges I had right
[02:40:09] no guys we're not gonna be kicking indoors the afghan's gonna kick indoors probably but
[02:40:14] you're not gonna kick in any doors and if you do well that's an extreme right but you got to
[02:40:20] work through with and buy these guys they're the ones that have to own it the end of the day and so
[02:40:24] we went to the same thought process but the guys realized that this was still a combat mission
[02:40:30] that this was not a man-be-pambi kind of hand-ringing humanitarian thing it was a combat mission
[02:40:39] and and so you know they got I mean they they they really they really made it work without them
[02:40:49] no way wouldn't have happened and so yeah so you start hearing this and we're getting concerned
[02:40:59] and and the concern is about a drawdown coming drawdown coming right changing from a combat
[02:41:05] operations to non-combat operations coming out of the village villages too early handing this
[02:41:11] program lock stock and barrel over to the afghan's at the senior level too early and you know
[02:41:21] we gave him the warnings we said hey likely the security situation will reverse likely the
[02:41:29] they'll be a resurgence and al-Qaeda will come back right well nobody thought that ISIS would
[02:41:40] come back but by 2016 we had a complete reversal because we did they made the decision they
[02:41:47] slapped a table we came out of the villages we went strictly top down we put all our emphasis on
[02:41:53] the afghan national army impolice to fight and gain security we didn't support the afghan
[02:42:01] local police program anymore and fell you know fell apart and I think it could have been
[02:42:10] avoidable I think a lot of other people who have done assessments on it not it could have been
[02:42:14] avoidable but nonetheless you know our guys on the ground regardless of what mission you give them
[02:42:21] still do it was honor integrity and they get done what you want them to get done but
[02:42:30] at the end of the day we saw ISIS come back we saw Kada emerge we saw Merge we saw
[02:42:42] Taliban come back and full force the security situation was reversed and we had an all-time
[02:42:48] high in casualties in 2019 so here we are in 2021 and you know President Trump I think had
[02:43:03] the right idea let's figure out how we can come out of afghanistan well nobody gave him a plan
[02:43:09] right when he asked for it two years into administration just didn't have plan to come out so
[02:43:14] you know hey the political situation you know overcomes everything right going into a presidential
[02:43:23] election year a big year for the congress you know and that starts driving decision making
[02:43:30] start driving decision making and really instead of the guys on the ground right exactly and so
[02:43:36] here we go and you know the president was response of the current president who's got to make a
[02:43:47] decision right I mean it is what it is but he was also in charge of when he was vice president
[02:43:55] you know coming out of Iraq in 2011 and going to zero and you know he he just used I think
[02:44:02] what he learned there and the experience he had there and applied it to Afghanistan and boom
[02:44:07] you know we're out lock stock in barrel and we although I am an advocate of you know figuring
[02:44:16] out how to come out of there I'm more of an advocate of coming out of there the right way
[02:44:20] and there's a lot to lose there particularly I mean I'm signing a lot of letters today
[02:44:26] from 20 years of working with people there in Afghanistan and interpreters and workers
[02:44:32] barbers you know guys you know gardeners guys that really put their life on the line
[02:44:39] to support us and to help us them and their families and now they're left there and and so
[02:44:47] I think I got 45 letters signed right now and I send everything I do to congressman Krenshaw
[02:44:55] and Tom Cotton because they're you know they're putting together some sort of process to expedite
[02:45:01] getting these guys out of there but you know it's a everything's political right and you know
[02:45:13] we just we're you know we're at a point in time now where you know strategy and policy
[02:45:21] and security inside our country and outside our country is is you know I mean I think it's an
[02:45:27] issue I think a lot of Americans see this is an issue right and yeah well especially when we
[02:45:35] see the other you know nation states that are making moves big moves and playing long playing the
[02:45:40] long strategic game and we're looking to the next election that's our long strategic game sometimes
[02:45:45] yeah right now 2022 is our long strategic game right I mean how are we gonna change the house
[02:45:50] and how are we gonna change the Senate and how are we gonna get the majority there not so much
[02:45:54] and how we're gonna deal with China and and how we're gonna deal with the potential
[02:45:59] invasion of Taiwan and how we're gonna deal with Russia and their encroachment on the Crimea
[02:46:04] and Europe and and their pipeline issues and and Iran and and you know their proxy war
[02:46:13] and what they're gonna do against Israel and North Korea is gonna follow China everywhere it
[02:46:18] goes and now it's working more on its nuclear program that it ever has been and we got you know
[02:46:25] no visibility on that and and those are some existential threats that we really got to pay attention
[02:46:32] and the real and the real and we got Africa right 28 countries in Africa that are just getting
[02:46:38] eaten alive by China and Russia you get eaten alive by terrorist organizations that are taking
[02:46:44] advantage of the ungoverned spaces and that's dangerous for Europe you know the French and the
[02:46:50] British and the Dutch and the Germans and the Italians the front line for the for the war against
[02:46:57] violent extremist organizations is in Africa for them you know it's mully it's Libya it's Tunisia
[02:47:06] and it's Kenya and it's uh Somalia and it's Nigeria and it's Senegal and Martania
[02:47:13] and Morocco you know it's all these different places right and you know I mean I spent four years
[02:47:20] in in US Africa and two years 26 months and that was commanding special operations command in Africa
[02:47:27] and we had 28 countries over 2000 special ops troops on the ground advising assisting training
[02:47:35] and conducting operations through with and by our partners to get after al Shibab right
[02:47:41] some of ISIS Somalia right out in the East there Central Africa the Lord's Resistance Army and
[02:47:49] now ISIS is there and Nigeria would bokeh her arm in ISIS West Africa and and and Chad and Cameroon
[02:47:58] and Pekingafaso and Mauritania and Senegal and and all of the affiliates of al-Qaeda that are out
[02:48:06] there reap and havoc right the French have over 4,000 troops on the ground and you know from
[02:48:11] mully to Nigeria because it's their war it's their front line right and you have a huge coalition of
[02:48:18] you know of European partners there I mean I dealt more with our European partners
[02:48:24] than special operations command Europe did because they're fighting in Africa right and so I was
[02:48:31] always you know coordinate with Mark Schwartz a Mark I'm going to I'm going to Denmark I'm going
[02:48:37] here I'm going there you know I I went to French five times right to talk to the highest levels
[02:48:43] of their government about you know what was going on there and you know so what was going on in
[02:48:52] Africa is is something that America's taking its eye off of and 1.4 billion people by 2050 it
[02:49:01] will be 2.4 billion people and incredible it's in resources there incredible amount of resources
[02:49:07] huge and what goes through South America into the United States you know South America is
[02:49:15] not very far from the African West coast and you got all those traditional lines of illicit
[02:49:20] trafficking that go through Europe the Iranians have multiple have been able to establish
[02:49:26] multiple places where they have infiltrated Africa all over Africa to move men weapons and
[02:49:32] resources at a drop of the hat if they need to so I mean we got other problems out there you know
[02:49:41] we have to keep our eye on it and Afghanistan we shouldn't be tied to one country but we got tied
[02:49:48] to that country there was a good way to go out but moving to a regional perspective with everything
[02:49:54] going on in that region is a whole heck of a lot smarter and you know we just need to start considering
[02:50:01] that but we I still think we have some responsibilities to Afghanistan that we kind of overlooked in our
[02:50:08] in our exit there you know you know you you're looking at the global perspective and the global
[02:50:16] issues clearly that's that's all stuff we have to think about but I know that there's one more issue
[02:50:21] that you've dealt with personally and you've tried to help out our troops with it and that's
[02:50:28] what's going on and what happens to our troops and what's happened to our troops well I guess
[02:50:32] as long as we've been around but we've definitely noticed it for sure since these wars kicked off
[02:50:37] the war on terror kicked off and that's a post traumatic stress and then the traumatic brain injuries
[02:50:45] what was your how how how did you address that how did you experience that what was that
[02:50:52] like for you and I know we've been talking for a while but I wanted to cover this because I mean this
[02:50:56] is something that a lot of people are are dealing with yes well I think it's the number one
[02:51:01] health issue that we have in the United States military today and I believe it's the same
[02:51:06] when you look at our veterans and it's leading to the significant amount of suicides and both on
[02:51:13] active duty in the reserves national guard and and again and better in community right and I think
[02:51:25] it's all has to do a dismantle injury issue and physical injury and spiritual injury and
[02:51:31] it's that triad that I think is hugely important that we have to work on strengthening all the
[02:51:36] time in the military because you know as well as I do if you're physically hurting you need
[02:51:43] that taken care of and mental injuries right you need that taken care of and we know by studying
[02:51:51] all the way back to to Sparta right that the traumatic brain injury and post traumatic
[02:51:58] stress was something that they looked at they didn't call it that right but they knew that a
[02:52:02] concoct on the head created problems right and they and they manifested themselves and they
[02:52:07] inside their their their units their military units and they they realize that they had a
[02:52:14] an obligation right and an ancient Sparta there's only two people to get their name on a headstown
[02:52:20] a mother who get who dies in childbirth and a warrior that dies in a battlefield everybody else is
[02:52:26] buried in Sparta with no name, no nothing but the birth of a child and the sacrifice in the
[02:52:36] battlefield the ultimate sacrifice on a battlefield are recognized in that warrior culture so
[02:52:41] when we look back and we see everything that we've done and what we've called it throughout the years
[02:52:47] and and I was one that didn't have an appreciation for it either right I thought it was a
[02:52:53] sign of weakness right there's no way right I mean you know you think about pattern and you think
[02:52:59] about you know the way our society has shaped us and I thought it was weakness as well until
[02:53:09] it happened to me until I started happening others until I realized what's the problem and you know
[02:53:14] who educated me on this my wife she's a nurse she started studying it she started seeing it she
[02:53:21] started seeing how I changed every time I came back and when you get more comfortable
[02:53:26] being away from your family and deployed in a combat zone and you do it home with your family
[02:53:34] you got a problem and that was me and it was affecting my relationships with you know my family
[02:53:41] it was affecting relationships in the military I was always you know wired for sound
[02:53:50] go high and right really quick and who's my temper and not want to listen to people and it just
[02:53:55] negatively affected everything right and she started noticing around 2008 and she was talking to me
[02:54:00] about getting help well it was no getting going for help 2008 and the military that right now
[02:54:06] in 2010 you started seeing programs and they were starting to deal with traumatic brain injury
[02:54:12] but I'm telling you we have all these programs but what I learned was our approaches were on
[02:54:18] right our our our approaches punitive we're going to take you off your team
[02:54:22] we take you away from the people at the law the people that you want to be with every single day
[02:54:27] and we're going to put you over here and we're going to say okay you're not going to do your duty
[02:54:32] you're not going to do your job and and oh by the way we're going to take you clearance away
[02:54:39] or suspended whatever and if you don't get better in a year we're going to process you out of the
[02:54:46] army I mean that's a TOD policy right and I thought that was insane well by 2013
[02:54:56] I had just been promoted Brigadier General I just got to US Africa US Africa just started my job
[02:55:03] as the operations officer there and just what my wife came to me and she said we can't handle it anymore
[02:55:09] I can't handle it kids can't handle it your dog can't handle it you know contact our husky at the time
[02:55:17] she goes you got to do something I got a draw line here she goes
[02:55:24] and I said you're right you're right and she's talking about losing your temper not being around
[02:55:31] social the isolating myself staying at work till ungodly hours just avoiding avoiding social events
[02:55:38] you know the my biggest fear was having to go to a social event right and I would look for
[02:55:48] every single excuse under the sun yep I'm going I'm going I'm going until I call her I'm saying
[02:55:55] hey something came up at work I need to stay with right check and I would go home right after the event
[02:56:02] was done so and she's not dumb she knows exactly what I was doing right and but she knew it was delicate right
[02:56:13] and and you know I wasn't a screamer at home I would just not involve myself anything right
[02:56:22] just come home and mind my own damn business not getting involved and that was that and you know
[02:56:32] if something came up I would exit stage right and avoid dealing with you know and then I would look for
[02:56:41] every opportunity I could to go to play somewhere right well when I went to US African that ability to
[02:56:47] play went away because as the operations officer US African the only place I was deployed to was my
[02:56:53] office right that was it yeah so 2013 she got me to go but I had heard about this nurse Sarah McNary
[02:57:04] who had was up at launch to when she's really innovative and so I went up and I had a meeting
[02:57:11] with her and I said listen you know I got to do this under the radar right I mean this is not
[02:57:17] something it would be accepted by the chain of command if I'm going for PTSD of help so she understood and
[02:57:26] she put me on a program I went up and it was easy for me to get away right we had African units
[02:57:33] up at launch tool you know Ramstein near launch tool and I could I could always find a way to get
[02:57:43] up there if I needed to go for an appointment or what have you so it wasn't a big one of the big
[02:57:47] stretch and it didn't put a lot of light on what I was doing but I went up there in three days
[02:57:55] got a value of post-matic stress TBI sweep disorder pain management issues
[02:58:01] neuro toxicity and there was all positive right I mean all the malaria medications and the
[02:58:11] vaccines and all these things that we've done all our career all our life it was my kidneys my you know
[02:58:19] other organs the way your brain thinks it's on so forth all that positive PTSD positive
[02:58:27] more important I got put on therapy programs right and so I took advantage of this and I did it
[02:58:34] religiously from 2013 through 2015 I managed to go through this and then I looked at myself in the
[02:58:44] mirror what are the therapy programs consist of so is this like sitting down talking with someone is this
[02:58:50] yes so they give you a bunch of tests for PTSD right and they figure out exactly what's you know what's
[02:58:57] wrong with your you know with your brain and you know we're you're thinking and how
[02:59:06] social isolation is impacting you and you know and they put you with a therapist and they work on
[02:59:12] those those things you you talk about it you come up with strategies to overcome it you you
[02:59:22] my wife came with me that was hugely important because you know she's got there's a quote
[02:59:30] above my doctors on my doctors office there in launch tool because my wife was with me and he asked
[02:59:39] me a question and I told him to my answer and she goes that's a bunch of bullshit because she
[02:59:47] know so he goes oh yeah what's the real deal right and so I realized the utility in that because
[02:59:56] sometimes we're embarrassed by our actions right and we don't want to fully disclose them well
[03:00:00] if you don't fully disclose then people aren't going to really understand how to help you and
[03:00:04] and when I had to travel and I had an appointment I did it by Skype and so I's the TBI had
[03:00:13] serious balance issues my eyes were out of focus and there's a machine that they test that on and a
[03:00:19] machine that they fix it on so my eyes got back into balance and my balance got they put you on
[03:00:25] a balance machine and you know you feel like an idiot and and I did all my balance exercises my
[03:00:33] balance got good you know there was I'd go for a walk with my wife we'd hold hands and I would you know
[03:00:37] I'm here off to the right and she's like hey you're killing me right and she pushed me back over
[03:00:44] and so on and so forth and so they just have all these strategies to fix here now think about it
[03:00:49] you got traumatic brain injury as a special operator and your balance is on and your eye focus is on
[03:00:55] and you're going to do a you know high risk CH MH 47 infiltration into a village and and then
[03:01:05] and then you know fast rope onto a building and then use a ladder to cross from one building to the
[03:01:11] other and your balance sucks right these are things we need to fix but we're not going to be able to fix
[03:01:17] them if we're not aware of them and so I started thinking about what a freaking coward I am doing this
[03:01:24] under the radar and not leading the way and so on and so forth so I went back and I talked to my boss
[03:01:30] about it as the operations officer in Africa and I said hey this is what I've been doing and I am a
[03:01:38] different man my wife sees it my kids see it my dogs see I am different I'm not perfect but I'm
[03:01:45] a better version of myself and he goes yeah I've noticed you've been showing up to our
[03:01:51] our to our social events on Fridays here in Africa and I go oh yeah he goes before you
[03:01:57] wouldn't come near him and he goes he goes that's good all right because I get it nice that I'm
[03:02:05] going to open it up to guys in the in the in the J3 and I did and I got them all together and I
[03:02:10] talked to them and I laid it all out and I told them what I was doing and I said I'm a freaking coward
[03:02:15] but I tell you what I'll do right now is you won't take it taken out of your job you won't get
[03:02:20] taken you won't lose your clearance I will back you up 100% I don't care if it is DOD policy they
[03:02:27] I don't care it's not the right approach so I got your back we did it and I'm telling you a lot
[03:02:33] of guys you know I carried that over when I took command of special operations command in Africa
[03:02:38] on 24 April and I got with them unbelievable 26 months at that what I thought were
[03:02:48] in discipline issues without go home and drugs was self-medication was guys trying to figure out
[03:02:58] how they're going to be able to alleviate their pain deal with their issues and still be able to
[03:03:04] do their mission the best of their ability right and in in South Africa we put even the deploying
[03:03:14] troops that came over we put them to the program and it was huge Navy SEALs marine special
[03:03:22] operators SF Air Force guys we got testimonies from wise marriages that were saved we decentralized
[03:03:29] the program like I remember I was in New Share which we were up in our lit which is
[03:03:37] in the middle of nowhere it's not the end of the world but you can see it from there you know
[03:03:41] I mean and and I did my Skype you know meeting with my therapist right I mean I still see a therapist
[03:03:51] right it's just something that I decided to continue but I'm very high functioning person
[03:03:57] and that was my point these guys are still high functioning and they're even more high functioning
[03:04:01] if we give them the treatment they need it's just a mental injury 52 people we we diagnosed with
[03:04:08] a PTSD 471 with with traumatic brain injury 471 and there's only one guy and you
[03:04:21] and believe on many people with pain management issues right I mean and sleep issues
[03:04:26] we're the definition of a sleeping you know sleep problems yes we are and and so we got
[03:04:33] them the machines or the mouth thing whatever they wanted and it was unbelievable you know if you
[03:04:40] if you get less than five hours of sleep your brain operates like it's got 0.10% alcohol in it
[03:04:48] you know legal limit of driving under the influence so for I don't know 25 years or so I was
[03:04:56] shit faced at work without taking a drop of alcohol you know and and think about your decision
[03:05:02] making and stuff like that and so the New York Times came into the unit and said hey we're going
[03:05:09] to do an article on Africa and then she started talking to people they said that's not the story
[03:05:14] the story is how we're dealing with post traumatic stress and TBI and getting resilience and
[03:05:19] ready to back in the end that story you should get asking about that so she asked me about
[03:05:23] an eye to older and that became the story I wasn't a popular story with a chanic man not a
[03:05:30] popular story at all and I was told to stop talking about it the more you talk about it the more
[03:05:38] problems we have and I said wow I don't agree with that I think the more we talk about it
[03:05:43] I'm all we understand it and the least problems we have and we get guys in the therapy and we can do
[03:05:49] it without degrading the mission I did I had 96 96 missions and special operations command
[03:05:56] and 846 associated tasks and I had zero zero detriment in mission and guys got better I mean
[03:06:07] drug and alcohol abuse you know incidents went way down I went to zero in misappro- you know
[03:06:15] misbehavior in the in the workplace zero right they sent a team from DOD to investigate
[03:06:22] what we were doing right and I said hey it's just a matter of taking care of mental physical
[03:06:27] injuries and spiritual you know so com had a great program that they brought in with that integrated
[03:06:34] families and we had that and we located in our headquarters and that was something that I had nothing
[03:06:41] to do with because the rules are that nothing gets reported to the chanic command and I'm okay
[03:06:46] with that right I don't need to know right guys there with their families working out problems it was
[03:06:52] really unbelievable after 26 months of you know of this and yeah you know that with for me it was
[03:07:04] a whole process of leadership and learning and understanding and then being able to say
[03:07:12] you're strong not weak if you ask for help right and I had three suicides in my unit I
[03:07:23] I'll know if again starting first class in Kenya six month rotation in Kenya combat operations
[03:07:29] with the Kenyan special ops Rangers against elk against alchibob and ISIS Samaria just great work
[03:07:39] packed up all this gear cleaned his quarters ready for standing but I don't know
[03:07:50] day before he was redeploy went out to the range sat in the chair and shot himself and had
[03:07:59] it was more painful him for him to go home at that point in time in his life in his decision making
[03:08:04] process then so he took his life I tell you what man I took a knee on that one you know what
[03:08:14] me I mean a big knee right and so I said we can't we can't allow that to happen you know
[03:08:26] it's bad enough to lose somebody in your unit combat but suicide and of course we missed all kinds
[03:08:36] of warning signals everybody missed one example you know who knew the family knew but the family
[03:08:43] was afraid to talk because they were afraid that if they say anything then it's gonna hurt their
[03:08:50] husband's career and so we need to be better at making sure it doesn't hurt their career make
[03:08:57] sure they get to help because we can do it we get a lot of white space on the counter we guys come
[03:09:01] back and we can make it work and taking these health assessments and gonna work right you got to
[03:09:09] have take these programs and you at the top I'm telling you rich put gliszy who was my senior
[03:09:15] and listed advisor maybe seal great guy love rich I know rich rich and I had the same issues
[03:09:21] and we would get in front of the unit and we would talk and we would share our personal experiences
[03:09:27] and we had it everyone's back the only person that didn't that got taken off was the
[03:09:33] sergeant major of our our uh sipping you know our direct action teams and that's because
[03:09:41] after we talked to him he took all 45 of his guys the next day over at launch tool ran
[03:09:47] him through the program and when he was getting his MRI to see if he had any traumatic rain
[03:09:52] injury they found a tumor about the size of an eraser on his brain he got met
[03:09:59] back to to Walter Reed they took the tumor off they said hey you know if this had gone another year you
[03:10:09] would have been figuring out an end of life plan and they replaced his left hip that he had been
[03:10:18] you know dealing with for years and he was a new man right and an advocate of this whole program
[03:10:27] and you know after he left the team he went off to our training and has been an advocate for this
[03:10:35] and you know promoting it ever since and this is what you get you get guys with a better understanding
[03:10:40] very bottom up but they got to have that top down cover and I'm afraid it's still not there it needs
[03:10:48] to be there we got to put it there and you know I went through the you know what everyone else
[03:10:57] goes through oh I'm weak something wrong with me I'm less of a man and that's none of that's true right
[03:11:11] so that's that was your last tour was was that sock African right that was it you know it was funny
[03:11:19] I joined the army 29 June 1981 and I gave up command and had my retirement ceremony on 29 June
[03:11:29] 2017 I didn't retire officially until two August 2017 but you know I came home and went on
[03:11:40] in Terminal League and started helping veterans put together a business called Truth to Power
[03:11:50] which I was doing really well with I'd have about four speaking events a month which was good
[03:11:57] just bringing in the money that I needed then I got hired to be an associate professor at
[03:12:02] New England College and I just got laid off and I was trying to find a job I got laid off and
[03:12:07] made trying to find a job so I ended up applying to Hampton Police Department and I am now a
[03:12:14] at 59 years old a police recruit in the New Hampshire Police Academy I'm the platoon leader
[03:12:22] and my the youngest guy in the class is 19 years old and I'm like holy crap and so
[03:12:30] I'll graduate November November 19th and it was funny because in 1980 I was in class number four
[03:12:40] because remember I told you about me in a police officer and I am now in class 281
[03:12:48] and so yeah I'll start working working at Hampton Police Department which is the town right next to
[03:12:55] stratum where I live now in New Hampshire it's on the seacoast so it's right there on the beach
[03:13:01] and the majority of the work there is patrolling the Hampton Beach area which is which is going to be
[03:13:08] cool and you know it's going to be a high adventure you have to obey watch yeah it's right
[03:13:17] and I you know I mean I've always looked at where I can contribute and I gotta tell you at 59 years old
[03:13:25] when I in its quite a process too because I applied and I got my test date of 3 May and I went
[03:13:36] and took my test with 27 other young guys right and that was the standardized test right so
[03:13:47] I hadn't taken a standard I'd test no 40 years so I was nervous about that right and I took the
[03:13:52] test that I passed much to my dismay and surprised and I got set up for my oral interview
[03:13:59] and I had the lieutenant sergeant in a patrolman and they go all right we know who you are
[03:14:05] we all voted for you right in the last election we all we know who you are and we know what you've
[03:14:11] done for our country why and they held you want to do this and I said hey I just looking for a
[03:14:17] way to contribute and you know there's no more to it than that and he goes okay and the sergeant
[03:14:25] starts asking me questions and it gets to the patrolman he goes I don't have any experience to ask
[03:14:32] you any questions and I said yeah you do your police officers so bring it on but nonetheless you
[03:14:38] know you do the polygraph and you do the physical fitness test and you do the the psychological
[03:14:45] test and it was like going through special ops again you know all those things that lead up
[03:14:50] to you get in you got a qualify physically mentally you know you got to pass the the full physical
[03:14:57] test and I have two prosthetic hips and three prosthetic discs because of combat injuries
[03:15:06] and that was the thing that we're worried about the most right and I said listen I've jumped out
[03:15:12] of your planes for these things I can certainly handle patrol with these things they go okay that's
[03:15:17] okay I guess you can right and and so my wife thought I was nuts so that might seem like nuts and
[03:15:26] then what it seems like even more nuts to me is you entering the political arena yes what
[03:15:32] what brought that about I was asked I was asked by I got a lot of emails texts and
[03:15:42] letters phone calls from people in all 10 counties in New Hampshire all 50 states
[03:15:50] to include across the military asking me to run for office and I thought well if people think I can
[03:15:57] help them I don't have all the answers certainly not a politician and I think there are many
[03:16:06] people in the military would have tested to my my lack of political acumen because it's just not
[03:16:12] there two straight forward blah blah blah but nonetheless if you think I can help you I'm going to try
[03:16:18] and so that's my why for running and and so you know I I just want to help our country our economy
[03:16:34] help us become more physically responsible and help us be able to improve the safety and security
[03:16:40] of Americans so that we can all live the American dream that's all I want to do right
[03:16:44] the oath I took in a military is still valid I still believe in and the American dream and
[03:16:53] the greatness of this country and and I have a tremendous amount of of exposure to
[03:17:01] what other people and other places across the world think and feel about America and the promise
[03:17:06] of America and I think that regardless of your political beliefs or spectrum that you fall on you know
[03:17:15] God family community in country has got to appeal to everybody and that's my platform and that's
[03:17:23] what I'm doing and that's what you're doing right now so what is it you're running for right now to
[03:17:27] serve everybody knows United States Senate in New Hampshire we're where you've lived for 59 out of 59
[03:17:33] or where you've been arrested and about 59 out of 59 years that's right and I've been a Republican
[03:17:38] in that state for 42 years my 18 years old first president I voted for was Ron Reagan
[03:17:49] so what's the when's that election timeline so the primary in New Hampshire so if I get another
[03:17:58] Republican that run is gonna run against me which there isn't one yet the primary election is in
[03:18:07] September of 2022 and the the general election if I win the primary against Senator Maggie
[03:18:18] has an Democrat who's been our senator for one term now will be four November 2022 I don't have
[03:18:29] a political machine behind me I got to get my name recognition up fundraising is huge so I got
[03:18:39] to start earlier than those that have already established politicians right and so I'm out
[03:18:47] now campaigning we're raising money we're getting our message out there it's being very well received
[03:18:55] in the last poll you know four months ago when they did a poll I was at 30 percent
[03:19:02] I'm now up at 45 percent right so moving in the right direction so if people want to help out
[03:19:11] where do they where do they find you where do they go to help you out so my website is www.donball
[03:19:17] dick.com and you know you can go there and you can either you know if you want to help the campaign
[03:19:24] out if you're in New Hampshire that's easy to do you just sign up you know everything is right
[03:19:32] there on the website my positions are there on the website so if you're interested in how I
[03:19:36] feel in the second amendment or whatever it's there and if you want to donate it's there
[03:19:49] you know I start pretty low I ask folks to donate $20 and $22 and $22 to my campaign and if I
[03:20:00] get a lot of people to do that I get a lot of money and it's you know anything helps
[03:20:09] $5 $10 $20 and $22 since 2000 $22 that helps too but everything helps and
[03:20:22] and I'm just going to go there to serve this 1.3 million people in New Hampshire
[03:20:28] and I'm going there to serve every single one of them not just the Republican party but
[03:20:35] you got to serve everybody once you get in that office right you got to declare an office and
[03:20:41] you know my my political beliefs line up as a Republican but that doesn't mean that I don't
[03:20:47] I won't work for in work hard for everybody in New Hampshire regardless of whether they're an
[03:20:51] independent Democrat or libertarian right and I think that's what we've lost in this country
[03:20:57] with the political divisiveness we can't come together on three very important things our
[03:21:01] economy fiscal responsibility and the safety and security of Americans we used to be able to do that
[03:21:07] you know I'm a big fan of JFK you know I mean big fan of him you know and
[03:21:14] he would not even be recognizable today right has matter fact he'd be more of a Republican than
[03:21:20] a Democrat today so we got to come together and we need people that I think have had
[03:21:29] the experiences in life that realizes that we're stronger if we work together then we
[03:21:36] and we are apart and are we going to have our differences yes but
[03:21:40] today our differences are just too much
[03:21:43] too much around what's really important God family community
[03:21:51] also you got social media too right do yeah we're yes sir we're we're on social media
[03:21:56] everything I would be remiss though if I didn't didn't mention the fact that
[03:22:03] everybody that found out I was coming here to talk on your show was like out of their mind
[03:22:07] and it was across the political spectrum that way which is which is really neat and
[03:22:14] no no one more excited than my son Zachary who serves in the New Hampshire National Guide
[03:22:20] he was speechless I mean it was like the goh juggle oh yeah he just couldn't speak right
[03:22:26] and he goes why didn't you tell me and I go I don't know I mean I just you know
[03:22:31] but well we have I work with the with the National Guard extensively my
[03:22:37] deployment to Ramadi they were there when we first showed up and they were just complete
[03:22:42] warriors and professionals and it was an honor to serve with those guys so I
[03:22:48] nothing nothing but love for the National Guard that's for sure yeah he's coming up on his six
[03:22:53] years and he's going to become a veteran he's already made that decision but nonetheless I am proud
[03:22:59] that he served his country and my youngest boy Matt is a senior at Purdue and he just finished his
[03:23:07] his lieutenant training so so that I pulled in the tradition he'll be a second lieutenant on
[03:23:12] active duty look out another ball of scum and fell as so oh so that's probably a good place to
[03:23:20] stop echo you got anything oh yeah real quick going back to the marijuana fields oh
[03:23:25] the scum and deep yeah yeah yeah and you mentioned booby traps yes like what kind of booby
[03:23:30] traps in the the the marijuana growers back in the day would put booby traps around their
[03:23:36] marijuana fields so people who wouldn't sneak in and steal their grow like what kind of
[03:23:40] booby traps so you would get the booby trap where you came across it and it would be just a it
[03:23:45] would it would kick off like like a ditch of like napal fire would come up also like violent booby traps
[03:23:55] bombs the old ones with like you like the you know you know Vietnam era stuff where
[03:24:05] like you stick to sticks and they would they were spring loaded kind of things and they would
[03:24:10] come and they would just hit you in the thigh or the leg or what have you upper body those kind of
[03:24:16] things yeah yeah they were serious yeah yeah well because I'm quiet and this is back in the day
[03:24:23] two when when it was illegal but they'd have booby traps but they wouldn't be violent booby traps they
[03:24:29] just be like alarm tightly you know like I heard one where they had just like cases and cases of
[03:24:36] mouse traps so like if you step on any you nudged it it would have a like you know like a bunch
[03:24:42] of birds taking off whatever but louder it'd be something like that like that kind of stuff
[03:24:46] they had those two violence really early warning device yeah yeah they had that and but they also had
[03:24:52] the closer you got the worse off it was for you and that's why the the the the forest
[03:25:02] Rangers were always you know they were very appreciative of us going in there because we take it
[03:25:07] very slow and you know our guys were trained very trained very well and we had you know we had
[03:25:13] some technology to help us out as well so but yeah that was there it was ugly and we're lucky
[03:25:20] that we didn't set any of them off that were able to either go around them or you know neutralize
[03:25:28] them in a different way was you know old fashioned way was with the the rope and the
[03:25:36] grappling grappling that pull about watch what happens wow that was a good show
[03:25:45] glad we went around that right on yeah general any closing thoughts
[03:25:51] well I think the only closing thought that I would have and since this is you know you focus on
[03:25:57] leadership a lot is I just like to let everybody know that throughout all this I realized that
[03:26:06] I was imperfect leader and that as long as I remembered really three things and that is to
[03:26:13] remain humble thankful and grateful and that I never let my ego get in the way and I was always
[03:26:21] self aware of my weaknesses and worked on those and let my strengths be what they are you
[03:26:29] better off for me and everybody else around me and these type of shows and the things that you do
[03:26:35] and what this show does for anyone who listens to it is is hugely important for America because
[03:26:44] right now but we need more anything else is effective leadership it is it is a huge huge
[03:26:55] issue and and something that I think my experience is teaching in college and being around my own
[03:27:03] kids and being around others is they're thriving for you know leadership and these examples that we
[03:27:10] have seen in the past and and you represent that here with this show and I just want to thank you
[03:27:16] for this opportunity I'm humbled and grateful for it and so thank you for what you do and thanks for
[03:27:22] letting me tell my story well thanks for coming on thanks for joining us more important thank you for
[03:27:29] your leadership your service to our great nation your sacrifices overseas it's been a long
[03:27:35] war for America you were there for most of it and that's saying a lot and you are still continuing
[03:27:42] to fight for America we appreciate it thank you God bless you thank you very much and with that
[03:27:52] general done bulldog has left the building definitely seen a lot
[03:28:01] and always looking to improve I think that's something we can definitely take away
[03:28:10] maybe we can all look to improve maybe that's a good idea echo Charles yes sir
[03:28:17] any suggestions and where we can start to improve ourselves yes what you got well he did mention
[03:28:25] how he's he didn't say he was the oldest one cadet in the police I think it's safe to assume
[03:28:33] he's the one that to be a 99 yeah but he did imply that you know but the fact the point is he's
[03:28:39] out there staying capable talking about jumping out of planes with hips a certain way to the
[03:28:45] extent where they're like oh yeah you pass just you can do you can still do this kind of stuff you
[03:28:49] were this capable you're in meaning the hips past yeah exactly right they're good to go remember
[03:28:56] they're they're like oh you you know they're concerned about his hips whatever and he was okay
[03:29:00] I jump out of planes with these hips and they're like oh and then you can patrol all right
[03:29:06] point is very capable high levels of capability 59 29 19 years old whatever we're maintaining it
[03:29:14] that clock is ticking clock is ticking I heard that too yeah that one so only want to keep
[03:29:21] ourselves capable mentally physically of course through this path of capability chasing
[03:29:30] we're chasing capability of course through this path we're going to take some beatings 100% take
[03:29:34] of our meat yeah you do some duty to take beating sometimes sometimes sometimes yes and that
[03:29:42] gun against squeezed on that one so you know unlike I said hey I after I rolled with you that
[03:29:46] one day and I was like man I feel like I got hit by a truck and you're like oh yeah full body
[03:29:51] domes right yeah it's way more than full body domes so magical got some emotional
[03:29:58] domes as well yeah man and that's that's real you know these it that's just one of the
[03:30:04] many examples of the beatings you're going to take on this path no problem though
[03:30:07] sometimes you need some supplementation to help you through those beatings in fact you get through
[03:30:12] these beatings that's when the capability starts to emerge seem saying additional levels of
[03:30:18] capability anyway got some supplements for you can help you help us so first supplement I
[03:30:24] would talk about is a new era of energy drinks straight up like the the old new category new
[03:30:32] category new paradigm shift oh yeah two three yomiya discipline go yeah yeah yeah yeah so no sugar
[03:30:42] it's a healthy energy drink straight up that actually tastes good yeah it's also someone someone
[03:30:48] wrote hey I thought Jockel didn't drink energy drinks I heard him say he didn't drink them unless he
[03:30:53] really needed him well why is that that's true that's a fact is a fact before this came out
[03:30:59] because you weren't going to want to drink one of the other energy you were going to you don't
[03:31:05] want to drink those unless you had to yeah I've got a 19 hour drive I'm 14 hours into it I'm fading
[03:31:11] I need something to boost me up for the next three hours okay cool overdose with caffeine
[03:31:16] get your jitters on but you get there yeah so that's what I used to do for sure now the
[03:31:22] substance I oh I've got something that I can drink it's actually healthy for me and it gives me the benefits
[03:31:29] of energy right it's a no-brainer yeah so do do do I drink traditional old school poisonous
[03:31:41] energy drinks the answer is no I don't I used to occasionally if I needed to now don't
[03:31:48] do never need to do that again because we have an alternative that's functional and works
[03:31:54] so there you go and taste good did you drink kombucha no have you ever
[03:31:58] I've tasted it I've probably it might have almost touched my lips but I can just smell stuff
[03:32:04] and I don't like it right yeah oh come kombucha is no exception in that regard but it tastes junk
[03:32:10] taste bad I know people including people that I'm related to that are so down with kombucha
[03:32:15] I get I get more females like kombucha than males I don't have those numbers in my family that's
[03:32:21] what I'm going on my family females are drinking kombucha yeah kombucha what is it yeah
[03:32:26] kombucha kombucha they're drinking females males not drinking my father in last
[03:32:31] straight up makes it straight up it's like a process it's a thing and then I assume he drinks it
[03:32:36] yes sir he does but in my experience you are more females are into kombucha you can males but
[03:32:43] that's not the point the point is if you ever tasted it you're like cool kombucha so healthy you
[03:32:48] know it's detox and whatever they say about kombucha I don't know it's healthy we'll just say bro
[03:32:54] try taste it you're like all right you all endure that taste for the health benefits you seem
[03:32:58] same but there's no reason to do that no there's not that's the thing so this one especially
[03:33:03] the mango flavor you drink down and you're like wait a second taste good and healthy and gives me
[03:33:09] energy no no lose situation right there okay just so everybody knows that the the mango
[03:33:16] flavor there's no difference other than the flavor yes you can't put it over here on a pedestal
[03:33:21] of whatever it tastes the best so in your opinion yes yeah I think any of the consensus
[03:33:28] still getting being formulated because new which is another kind of novel thing new flavor so you
[03:33:35] know you want to look at that one I always go back to old faithful jockel ponder yeah I can't I
[03:33:40] can't argue with that right yeah it's legitimate yes sir JP to no point it out that jockel ponder
[03:33:45] tastes good whether it's like room temperature or whether it's cold yeah don't want to hear good
[03:33:50] you go orange is like that too so yeah get your oh it's called jockel discipline go if you didn't
[03:33:56] know already which you know most of us do know but we I do want to kind of reiterate these things about it
[03:34:01] yeah by the way it's available in wall wall right now and we're working on a bunch of other
[03:34:07] convenience stores you'll be seeing it but everyone that's been going out to wall wall and just
[03:34:12] clear and shelves thank you because that makes the other you're actually helping everyone in the
[03:34:17] in the nation you're helping everything is because other convenience stores look at wall on
[03:34:22] thing oh how's it going they go how's it doing they're whoa yeah you're selling a lot of that
[03:34:27] stuff so that means other convenience stores go all right we want it too and they're saying that
[03:34:31] so we appreciate East Coast troopers out there clearing shelves in wall wall yeah it does make sense right
[03:34:39] if you're a let's say convenience store owner yeah right okay it makes the decisions whatever
[03:34:44] and he's gonna be like wait the healthy energy drink he's gonna be thinking kombucha or something like this
[03:34:48] where it's like cool to know might not taste that good whatever but wall was over here demonstrating
[03:34:53] the aim rather it's gonna taste good too you know so they're like oh I get it now you know they kind
[03:34:57] of connect in the dots a little bit yeah so there's all this data so they go back and it's been great
[03:35:03] so again since you're appreciation everyone that's been rolling out to wall wall and just getting it
[03:35:09] appreciated that's awesome and you're helping America because now the rest of other convenience
[03:35:15] stores are getting on board and then other people will have access to this wonderful
[03:35:20] nutritious as Travis Mills said nutritious and delicious delicious and delicious oh yeah fully also other
[03:35:29] items that can that do help us on the path is we've got some joint stuff joint warfare super
[03:35:34] krill oil another good for your joints oh yeah and the thing is it's a big deal and this is like we
[03:35:42] always say this is one of those things where this really pays for itself in a way that's like invisible
[03:35:50] because you're not worried about your joints you all feel the difference when you don't have it
[03:35:54] what's interesting here's what's interesting we have massive amount of subscriptions to those too
[03:36:02] so people yes send it to me every month because they want to not miss out on that goodness
[03:36:08] yeah and then so I just worry they don't want to know about that and if you want to subscribe to it

[03:37:17] on the massive justice I was wearing the first edition white rift guis things are freaking unbelievable
[03:37:25] it's like a whole new thing era yeah a paradigm shift yeah yeah yeah yeah they're the best
[03:37:34] the the only downside is that you will potentially be spoiled in that way throw away your
[03:37:39] other guis or at least marginalism I had I put on one to see oh yeah does it still fit and you
[03:37:45] know feel like it and you feel like I would never wear this I mean cool respect oh you put
[03:37:49] one of the old ones and it's it just simply went out of the rotation yeah and plus you know it
[03:37:55] has bad karma why because it was made by a slave labor yeah china yeah yeah what's cool
[03:38:03] too is and we can you can see this on the origin youtube channel it's like it's the opposite of slave
[03:38:09] labor it's like it's one thing to be like okay you have slave labor okay they don't want to be
[03:38:13] there they're kind of in a way like obligated or forced in one some way to be there and they
[03:38:17] got to make this stuff okay that's terrible obviously but then you have like maybe the quote
[03:38:21] unquote stand towards like hey that's the job they're gonna go and they're gonna do it but you
[03:38:24] get origin you go there brought those there but every single one you see them all man they go
[03:38:29] for the car they care about that stitch you see what they care about like the whole deal then they
[03:38:33] make that even you get to wear it that's the then you get positive karma this karma with that
[03:38:39] you all around good karma with those jeans the working pants supporting American economy as well

[03:40:16] but they're there you've got a kid warrior kid podcast we also have jocco underground dot com
[03:40:20] we have a that's a little um little sovereign area of the interwebs that we built to make sure
[03:40:28] that we can remain free out here and because of these people doing all kind of weird stuff
[03:40:34] with these platforms that we're on so far everything's been cool it's cool we appreciate it
[03:40:39] but contingency wise you can't just you can't build your house on someone else's
[03:40:46] bland because they might come around and kick you off right so we may have an early land
[03:40:51] it's called jocco underground dot com if you want to help us support that land if you want to
[03:40:56] if you want maybe a little room on that land maybe you want a little plot we can get you one
[03:41:02] because they've got a little native sense of month hey if you look and if you if you need to
[03:41:06] come on to the land the sovereign land of the jocco underground and you can't afford it it's okay
[03:41:10] we want you there as long as you're in the game you can just email assistance at jocco underground dot com
[03:41:15] that's we appreciate it again for real if something goes sideways on these platforms we're going to be
[03:41:20] there and and as a as a appreciation we do another little podcast it's usually about an hour
[03:41:27] we talk about some other subjects we answer Q&A questions that have been sent directly to the underground
[03:41:34] then we cannot tell you what's up so that's that we also be YouTube channel and a lot of people
[03:41:39] correctly identified on the latest release of the mayhem movie that echo Charles made a lot of people
[03:41:48] recognize that there was some powerful assistant directing on all of the common strong ADP
[03:41:56] as new the ADP presence I'm the assistant director and and also you know kind of
[03:42:02] I had a supporting role in that yeah what do you think so actually you might have been the lead
[03:42:07] unknown I don't know if I had zero lines yeah which is they were powerful though that's the thing
[03:42:12] you're zero lines because your whole performance is powerful because big shocker echo made a movie and
[03:42:17] he's the star of it that's kind of the feeling that most people got
[03:42:23] retired main tie this sent me like it was a clip of us talking about it or whatever and
[03:42:31] how like you know the the time you're you're clicking on the can or whatever in the video or whatever
[03:42:35] it gets me I guess at the end of the day I was giving you props for that oh whatever and
[03:42:41] I feel like everyone including main tie is kind of just sort of recognizing you straight up
[03:42:47] you're the AD assistant director so all right let's find out what I still feel like I'm in the shadow of the star
[03:42:54] the person with all the lines yes and the most camera time yes you are no that's you dude
[03:43:02] you're in you yes are you to channel we do have a on top of jockelv in this assistant director we do
[03:43:10] other video version of all this stuff if you want to see what general don bull buck looks like you
[03:43:16] come on here yeah and you took a youtube channel youtube is you know one of those things now it's not
[03:43:20] just a video thing anymore it's like some people it's their preferred method to like watch TV
[03:43:26] listen to podcasts or whatever so I dig it and we got you that's what we got this whole thing
[03:43:30] I think I'm a little stable yeah I mean does anyone worth TV like actual TV like a show
[03:43:38] yeah is that happening yeah okay some DVR action okay I don't know if people still watch it live like live
[03:43:45] I don't think so that might be very low numbers and the all-sector the commercials and stuff
[03:43:51] the commercials are kind of a non-starter for me if it's junction in life yeah you know it's weird
[03:43:58] to my kids kind of the same way is like I like commercial not all of them but well fast forward
[03:44:05] through them but if I see one then I'm like oh let me see that commercial like it's kind of
[03:44:08] there's no commercial there's like a because some commercials there's this little story
[03:44:12] living in the commercial it's kind of good I feel that way right so yeah anyway yeah the point is
[03:44:18] we have a youtube channel bull subscribe to it subscribe to it if you want it's good one
[03:44:24] so yeah there you go also psychological warfare if you don't know what that is an album
[03:44:30] a jockel album with jockel tracks on there telling us how to get past our moments of weakness when we
[03:44:37] have them and I have them from time to time but you know gotta worry about that kind of stuff
[03:44:41] because jockel tell you why you should get over 100% uh success on the 100% if you want to hang
[03:44:47] something cool on your wall why not make it something from flipsidecampus.com that my brother
[03:44:53] Dakota Meyer made owns he is the owner make fun how do we make fun of him he's the creative
[03:45:01] artistic director of that thing there you go Dakota creative artistic director I think that's
[03:45:07] the title he's always wanted yeah I don't doubt it it's a good title that's Dakota one of my heroes
[03:45:13] and if you want to get some stuff to hang on your wall flipsidecampus.com got a bunch of books
[03:45:18] I've written a bunch of books but the one that's coming out next is called final spin
[03:45:22] we don't know if it's a novel we don't know if it's a poem we don't know if it's a manuscript we
[03:45:27] don't know what it is but it tells a story story with some lessons
[03:45:36] I let my oldest daughter read the book final spin and she got done reading it
[03:45:44] and she came out the kitchen and like I could see that she just got done reading it
[03:45:49] and I go oh you know what do you think and she started explaining to me what she liked and what she
[03:45:55] didn't like and she started crying well she was explaining it that's when I said to myself okay
[03:46:03] looks like I found it it's like we got it we got what we wanted yeah that's funny that we just have
[03:46:09] some kind of an impact right that's what we want yeah want that thing to leave a mark a little bit
[03:46:14] you ever think about that like why do we you're cried during the movie no come on bro
[03:46:19] zero you never cried during the movie no we're not you didn't say when I was young ever yeah
[03:46:25] you're not in your own yeah yeah well movie I'm pretty sure ET you know what sucks is I watch
[03:46:33] ET with my daughter who's she was 11 when I watched her whether just was just like this year
[03:46:38] have you seen ET lately no not lately Steven Spielberg no offense that movie did not stand
[03:46:43] a test of time hey I went to the theater when I was a kid it was all that movie and I was with
[03:46:49] a friend of mine and we were kind of you know little tough guys we were probably 10 something like
[03:46:55] that little tough guys you know and we were bawling and I watched the movie well apart that
[03:47:02] I can't remember the end of it or something I don't know he goes home I mean event right that's
[03:47:07] like what it's supposed to be the so I watch it with my daughter and I'm sort of bracing for her
[03:47:12] and I'm thinking all this going she she just it was bad it didn't stand the test of time
[03:47:18] now look jaws as you know I mean jaws one of my favorite movies Steven Spielberg good job credit
[03:47:24] that's the test of time and then some now could we go back maybe CGI some shark activity
[03:47:29] we probably good I guess I don't really want them to do you want them to no no you like it old school
[03:47:34] so keep it the way it is bro but you're not gonna beat Quinn and chief brody right it's not happening
[03:47:40] I mean who's gonna do better Quinn let's face it so Steven Spielberg jaws to the test of time
[03:47:46] good to go credit however ET bro wait why it cuz the story or just cuz the special thing the whole thing
[03:47:54] the whole thing it was like an okay movie but I don't like okay movies you know that doesn't do it
[03:48:01] for me they gotta blow you away yeah I want to get I want to get something to take an hour and a half
[03:48:06] to watch movie maybe two hours sometimes I'm not and this juncture my life if something's not
[03:48:11] good to go I'm done no time we're not watching it yeah I will leave a theater I will leave
[03:48:18] I'm not watching this stupid or you know what I'll actually do sleep thanks to you like
[03:48:23] get some rest oh yeah if I'm with my wife or my kids and there's a bad movie we want to
[03:48:28] saw okay have you ever heard of a horror movie that's called it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the
[03:48:36] first one came out my kids really like that horror movie my wife doesn't even watch one millisecond
[03:48:41] of a horror movie the first the first the first the new ones cuz it is old school that's old
[03:48:46] first the new ones he's doing with the clown face and that's all that's all that's all he's the
[03:48:51] story okay so I watched the the one of them okay anyways okay but then my kids were all
[03:48:57] amped and so we actually went to the theater to go see it the second version of whatever the
[03:49:02] tune to the two those those whatever we were all in there it is so bad I just was like I
[03:49:10] watched maybe seven to twelve minutes of it maybe maybe and I was out sleep cut up on some sleep
[03:49:18] they woke me up I saw the last the last seven minutes of it yeah it was so bad
[03:49:24] and we all walked out of there my kids thought it was bad too oh for a thing okay let me
[03:49:30] make sense you ever okay it's okay now we're kind of deviating but I don't care talk about it
[03:49:35] it's cool I've never seen the nuance I saw the old ones like they're super long too and cool I
[03:49:40] get what they're doing and they're good but it the new not chapter two like the the first one
[03:49:46] of the new ones so the thing I didn't see any of the butt they they have a trailer for that
[03:49:51] no man it's really good trailer they have a few of them but it's the one where it's like hey
[03:49:58] there's Georgie and the older brother I forget the older brother he's like hey you'll float
[03:50:05] to like hey if you come down here or everything floats down here is what the ghost kid says right
[03:50:10] everything floats down there I think that's what the clown said first I guess anyway so he's like
[03:50:14] if you come down here you'll float too and then like this beat this horror kind of beat like
[03:50:19] starts speaking out but he goes yo float too you know float it's really really well done
[03:50:24] trailer now one yep well must have been better than the movie I think so and remember when
[03:50:29] a long time ago when we were talking you were like oh why did you start video or whatever
[03:50:33] and the whole phenomenon that some some movies actually a lot of movies I mean I could name a lot
[03:50:38] of movies that the trailer is better than the movie like watching the trailer provides a better like
[03:50:43] experience than watching the movie yeah that's totally true so that phenomenon is kind of what made
[03:50:48] me like one of the videos or whatever you know it that's wonderful you have to say the tea
[03:50:53] distinctly for it just so final spin we don't really know what it is but it will withdraw some
[03:51:01] emotion some lessons learned some thought provoking material yeah final spin cool you can preorder
