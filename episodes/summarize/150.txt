There was just one time when we were traveling and we were having supplies, hard to keep up with this and stuff, you know, so it was, you know, you know, you know, water, you know, the fuel and you ended up, you know, bathing in bomb, bomb craters and things like that. because all of like you know the the post recording plans they're all still there you know and you're like hey let's train it's like noon at that time so other people were here you know there's the buzz you know the buzz of training You could ask a question, they just would be like, it's a bail, you know, like, wrong, like, well, build your board, but don't, you know, like, don't go nose and and around, you know. yeah that's the only way it should be you know how you like little kid should be on the mulk train everywhere I agree you say that you know how there's like right now you can flip on the news and you can see like obesity in America if everyone just gets on the mulk train will just be like America's now you you're a pro you're a pro you're not a america now you're what happened they're tracing it back to a strange podcast that talked about a a formula that they called mulk and the children they started to drink it and now the children of america are yoked It was just, it was more like, we would watch the shortboard videos, like all the lost videos, you know, and that's what we'd watch, like the Taylor steel stuff, like momentum and focus, like, that's what we watched, but somehow, like, I ended up just being the longboarder in the group, so to my friend, Joe. and but here's the thing when you train that adversity element you're like you kind of you want to do that it's like it's like invited to adversity kind of thing do you know just like how you just said where it's like hey I mean, I saw a M60 tank, you know, you had a 500 pounder around and I didn't, you know, I'll split in half like that, and went off like this, you know, two guys live. And I think just again, as like almost a advice is like what the approach you took was, hey, be humble, be persistent, you know, show up, absorb, don't run your mouth, you know, you want like, hey, can you be my mentor? You know, maybe, I guess I wasn't that, you know, like, I wasn't like a big guy, but I don't know. I was like, I want that, man, because it's like consistent boards every month, you know, 10, 15, 20, 30, who knows what, you know, numbers he was doing, but I was like, that's how you make it. hey I'm going to train jiu jitsu Monday no jiu jitsu Tuesday I'm going to lift Tuesday instead you know like some people have that plan you know where you're not going to do a two-day scenario then yeah don't train don't train twice a day or twice the in a row I don't agree I know you did a bunch of different, like, types of missions while you were there, like, in terms of, you did, like, look, let's just ask you like, so what are the various types of missions that you guys were doing? anymore they know your kid knows ice cream makes them weak they know that and if they don't know that they should you should tell them so let them know that warrior kid mulk it tastes delicious This is still crew back then holding it down and I'm like, hey, man, you're going to get your kid heard out here and like this like like 55 barrel drum like sits up and just looks at me. And we know they're not good for us, but you're like have you like like you're like No, it's just a few croutons. so I will vouch for that that is a factual thing that will happen you don't feel like it I will mix up you know I'll mix up all the kind you know when I don't feel like going yeah that's exactly what I was thinking that whole thing where you know it's kind of going in circles with the thing where it's like you should never be unhappy or not want to train you know kind of scenario Yeah, we ran into a lot of places like bunker systems, stuff that they had wires and, you know, for communications and things, you know, but, yeah, the mines, I was in a situation where two tracks in front of me, we, we take this another fire fire fire, we created and stuff. and we picked up the glosser polisher there and also the fin laminator guy John that puts the fins on so it's really become this like real tight crew and again, legends beyond me, I mean these guys have been building boards for 40 plus years, I just happen to be the kid that's given him foam, you know, so really super thankful and Dave runs a super tight ship, you know, there's not there's no money in glassing so if we can squeak out 20 bucks a bore that's what we're doing so we're trying to change it though but slowly everybody needs to do it together, right, every shape or every glass shop needs to work together And, you know, it's like, this, it's a small little, it's a small little, you know, indication of, hey, like you said, we're not better than you. Oh, I did, you know, I wrote this board with this fin set up, and I mean, that's the first 10 minutes of any conversation with him, not like, oh, however the waves, he's like, no, but I really, you know, he's just to see somebody at 77 is stoked as a 14 year old. And then they put me through, um, NCO school, which is, because they need a lot of, you know, you know, you know, so did you get it like maritory of the advanced to become an NCO or? You know, we're going to move, you know, we, we keep, keep the ability to move back and then we're reading in advance, you know, I mean, you got to think about that. Yeah, you had your quiet time to stuff you could listen to the cassette, you know, at least here's a voice or you get a care pack as you're something, you know, it's got some good cookies in it from home or something like that. The one was the escalation, looking like in terms of going from where, you know, you start Josh Hall surfboards to where, I mean, you know, obviously when you start off, you got to sell some of the boards. And Pete you know Pete's like a sick athlete you know what I mean like if he played football and he basically runs it, I just make sure that there's foam there organized, hopefully by Tuesday at noon every week because that's when we start batches, but so that, so Jeff had given me a year to kind of like, suck it out because there's no, I can't just go higher, somebody to laminate color, tint jobs, you know, I can't go, so we started putting the word out, started with my sander Wade who was working at Diamond, glassing and who's also a fry guy and so we've always gotten along and he was, well, I know, one, so he kind of put us onto a laminator and then I knew a guy that could sand and also do fins You know, I mean, it's like, you know, you got big guys, small guys. it might as well just be good for you because it has peanuts in it like brother it's like just chocolate and caramel you know like these things are not good for you I just, you know, and then what, what he could afford to get me to, you know, my first board was a broken and half guy talking along board that got fixed at Island Surf, you know, and that's what I wrote. exactly and then you finish and you're like man I can't finish like it's not you know the dude when he called diminishing returns You know after about halfway down I don't like the words say she ate it you know what does it mean that you don't like the word say she had it sounds kind of like weird well that's my grandpa he's like I don't care if you disagree you got to listen to somebody because they might have something that you don't for maybe they put it in a way you didn't think of well you can grow from that I guess to your point what as I just said hey if you're out there and you're in a more senior position reach down and help people out and if you're one of the young bucks out there then like Josh just said open your ears and have a listen because people got some good information for you and they can point you in the right direction so you don't have to learn the lessons the hard way there you go but I think it kind of crept up on you like if you would have known like I know to the scenario you'd be like And a couple of those guys said, hey, you know, I, you know, try to go to the, the, the Dell, you know, so I went down there and they go, what do you do? yeah, you know, before you know, you know, I was working to cabinet shop and then after that, I was building houses and, and then, uh, I worked for the gas company, uh, in the 80s. If I had my own little, you know, year under ground bunker and stuff, you know, because we took a lot of artillery at night and, you know, the rocket fire and everything. You live on the track with them, you know, you live in, in, in the groups, the sergeants, you know, we will get together and we'll have meetings and stuff, you know, and guys will be out on the tracks, clean, whatever they're doing. but you should never be in what I was thinking of you should it should never be like this hard like grind to the point where you're unhappy you know like no one should be on that be trained never a great thing You know, that was my big R&Rs and stuff, you know, but, uh, you know, a few people go to Hawaii. So three and a half years ago, again, Jeff McCallum, he left that one factory room back in 2009 and then that's when I went and shaped in a, in a garage in that same complex that skips in, he goes, hey, man, and he had this shop for five years ago, hey, I'm going to get out of this and, you know, the owner or whatever, you know, it's something to go on down and end of his leesey goes, I'm going to go try and buy a building. And he doesn't, you know, I got, I got burned by somebody or something like that, you know, and, and took some of his shapes and I don't really do that. Where, you know, I've got two hours where, you know, I'll go here and sure enough, you know. They were, you know, teaching you use all the weapon systems, and then you know, you know, prepare yourself for what's going on. You know, it's kind of like, you know, Johnny ain't got the gun. I didn't, you know, after, you know, the divorce and stuff, you know, I was just wandering. but I don't actually feel like when I was competing in a head like a competition like goal like I would feel that sometimes Kids like like like like me now, and he's filled in their first second third, tenth board. yeah awesome all right thanks for coming on guys thank you appreciate it thank you and we'll see you in the water all right at this point our guess Dave and Josh Hall have exited the building and awesome to talk to them and wrapping it up there you know talking about sharing what you know So would you, would you want to maybe take this over and I was like, oh, okay, well, and my business partner Dave, he and I have been talking for maybe six or seven years and how he, he's obsessed with surfing, but he comes from like the finance world, you know? Hey, can you be my, it's like, yeah, you know, hey, can you mind if I just sit over here and just watch like So after that, it was like the track lasts for like, if you've powered it on, it's like 32 seconds of, of, broad like that flying out. So you're busy doing this, you know, and Jimmy's gone, Johnny's gone, or, you know, you don't know until you get back to base camp, whether you made or not.
