00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.60
This is Jockel Podcast number 32 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.84
Find a new mission. That right there is some advice that I have given a bunch of guys, a bunch

3
00:00:15.84 --> 00:00:23.28
of veterans over the last decade because when you leave the military, that mission that you

4
00:00:23.28 --> 00:00:34.72
been on this honorable mission, all of a sudden overnight, it's gone and that's going to leave

5
00:00:34.72 --> 00:00:46.08
a hole. And the longer you serve, the bigger that hole is going to be. And for some of us,

6
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:53.20
if the only thing you ever really want to do was serve and execute that mission, it can be

7
00:00:53.20 --> 00:01:03.60
a rough transition, especially after you spend 20 plus years with the opportunity to do what you

8
00:01:03.60 --> 00:01:10.72
always want to do to wear the cloth of the nation to take the fight to the enemy. And it's an

9
00:01:10.72 --> 00:01:18.80
honor to have had the opportunity to do that to work with a bunch of other people that are also

10
00:01:18.80 --> 00:01:27.44
dedicated to one thing in life. And that is executing the mission. So once that's gone,

11
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:36.64
like I said, it can be a rough transition and you have to find a new mission. And some veterans

12
00:01:36.64 --> 00:01:42.16
going to business, some of them focus on their family, some of them start nonprofits,

13
00:01:42.16 --> 00:01:53.28
those are the positive things you can do, some serving other ways. And some just seem to keep going

14
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.56
and keep getting after it and keep moving forward with new missions. And we're lucky enough to have

15
00:02:01.84 --> 00:02:10.80
people like that in our country. And I know one in particular that served in special forces

16
00:02:10.80 --> 00:02:18.40
Green Brey, fought in Afghanistan, Iraq served as a contractor supporting the State Department

17
00:02:18.40 --> 00:02:27.92
and supporting the CIA. It spent almost nine years all told in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria

18
00:02:28.72 --> 00:02:35.44
and in a bunch of places all over the world as well. But that wasn't enough.

19
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:44.64
Needed more missions. This guy is also a businessman. CrossFit Jim, a giant CrossFit Jim,

20
00:02:44.64 --> 00:02:52.08
has a firearms range and a tactical training company. And he's competed in CrossFit and weight

21
00:02:52.08 --> 00:02:57.36
lifting an iron man and ultra running and he's coached athletes from CrossFit and strong man and

22
00:02:57.36 --> 00:03:05.84
triathlon. And it's up of all that in December of 2021, just a few months ago,

23
00:03:07.28 --> 00:03:15.84
he volunteered once again with a new mission to represent the people of North Carolina by running

24
00:03:15.84 --> 00:03:26.000
as an elected member of Congress. This man's name is Tony Cowden and it's an honor to have him here

25
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.36
with us tonight to share some of his experiences and the lessons that he's learned along the way,

26
00:03:32.16 --> 00:03:38.64
Tony. Thanks for coming by. Thanks for having me. What's up with that bio? Take it easy, man.

27
00:03:39.84 --> 00:03:44.96
You know, people always say, like, hey man, I know you're busy. You know, yeah, I'm busy.

28
00:03:45.84 --> 00:03:52.72
I'm always busy. I don't take naps. I'm busy. You know, I got stuff to do and when I don't have

29
00:03:52.72 --> 00:03:57.04
things to do, I find things to do. You know, they all think like if you didn't get anything to do,

30
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:02.56
clean something, I'm probably not that good at that if you ever see me my guns. It's not what I'm

31
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:09.44
known for. But yeah, man, one thing after another and you hit it on that intro, how many,

32
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:17.36
how many of our brothers and arms got out and that whole consumed them. They didn't find

33
00:04:17.36 --> 00:04:24.80
purpose. Everybody wants to know why is suicide so bad? Most veterans and across the United States

34
00:04:24.80 --> 00:04:32.48
in general, purpose. People with purpose don't commit suicide. You know, and when guys get out of the

35
00:04:32.48 --> 00:04:38.40
military, like you said, especially after filling using and abused in the 20s some years war now,

36
00:04:39.36 --> 00:04:45.28
where even the war itself, guys started questioning the purpose. What was the purpose? And at this

37
00:04:45.28 --> 00:04:53.28
point, we certainly don't know. But yeah, man, without purpose, you know, guys start drinking.

38
00:04:53.28 --> 00:04:59.84
It's a depressing. It's a poison. You know, they don't stop training because, you know, like me,

39
00:04:59.84 --> 00:05:04.40
I've always liked to train by myself. You know, I've only had one training partner in my entire life.

40
00:05:04.40 --> 00:05:09.92
It's my girlfriend Melissa. You know, she's the only dude I know that can keep up. No, I'm kidding.

41
00:05:09.92 --> 00:05:14.80
I should try to keep up with her. But I was just that guy that went into the gym by myself.

42
00:05:14.80 --> 00:05:19.60
It was my time. I went to run by myself and went rock by myself. I swam by myself.

43
00:05:19.60 --> 00:05:24.96
I thought that's safe for anything but whatever. But you know, those guys on the teams that

44
00:05:24.96 --> 00:05:28.48
go to the gym with their buddies, you know, they got their little click, little two and three

45
00:05:28.48 --> 00:05:33.28
man, team that goes to the gym. You know, when those guys come out, the surface they stop working out.

46
00:05:33.28 --> 00:05:39.44
You know, they lose their physical fitness. They drink. Maybe they got hurt and the VA put them on

47
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:45.60
opioid, you know, the storing, you know, and they don't have purpose. And it breaks my heart.

48
00:05:47.12 --> 00:05:52.48
So many Americans, not just veterans, right? Because, you know, throughout the gym and everything,

49
00:05:52.48 --> 00:05:58.56
that grew so many civilian friends or whatever. And I don't use that term, you know, negatively.

50
00:05:58.56 --> 00:06:03.76
And anyway, I'm some of the best friends or regular people. Some of the best friends or

51
00:06:03.76 --> 00:06:10.24
regular people. Right? And a lot of times, you know, the deal, we would use that terminology

52
00:06:10.24 --> 00:06:15.28
like when on the teams and stuff like regular people. Like it was kind of looked out of my

53
00:06:15.28 --> 00:06:20.40
core of eye, not down at them. But you know, we recognize that, you know, we get this little team

54
00:06:20.40 --> 00:06:24.72
and we really think we're the most awesome ever, you know, like they'll joke. You know, you want to

55
00:06:24.72 --> 00:06:29.84
know who the best is in special forces or special operations, ask any unit. They'll tell you.

56
00:06:29.84 --> 00:06:34.40
All right, ask a seal. Seals are the best. I ask a danger. They're the best. You know,

57
00:06:34.40 --> 00:06:39.60
all with very different missions. But yeah, man, Americans in general, especially after

58
00:06:39.60 --> 00:06:45.84
this whole pandemic, figuring out the wild, no people are losing that purpose and we're losing

59
00:06:45.84 --> 00:06:51.04
that pride in our nation and, you know, now with all the containment and the mass and the mandates

60
00:06:51.04 --> 00:06:57.60
and stuff, and it's suicide mental health is, I mean, it's scary. You know, that's of despair.

61
00:06:57.60 --> 00:07:01.92
It's been a nightmare. Um, yes. Let's get into all that in a little bit,

62
00:07:01.92 --> 00:07:05.36
but let's start off just to get to know you a little bit. Let's start at the beginning.

63
00:07:07.36 --> 00:07:14.40
A little white trash red net kid from very rural North Carolina. You know, and I, that's

64
00:07:14.40 --> 00:07:19.60
definitely in terms of impairment. My, my dad, 80 second airborne guy. Oh, yeah, I'm already

65
00:07:21.44 --> 00:07:26.56
one a weekend leave from Fayetteville for brag in Wellington at my mom. Is that you're

66
00:07:26.56 --> 00:07:32.56
a festival weekend and that's a big thing in Wellington. That's a festival. And apparently he

67
00:07:32.56 --> 00:07:37.60
head over Hills and love with my mom, right? And, you know, freaking, they got married,

68
00:07:37.60 --> 00:07:41.84
got other, I mean, moved back to where he was from up in Indiana. She was from

69
00:07:41.84 --> 00:07:47.52
Palico County, North Carolina. We always use, we have to use the county as a marker,

70
00:07:47.52 --> 00:07:52.000
because there's no town in Palico County that anyone would even have heard of unless you

71
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.40
actually lived or visited there often, right? So near towns like Newburn,

72
00:07:56.40 --> 00:08:00.08
so it's very rural. One of the biggest counties in North Carolina smallest populations.

73
00:08:00.88 --> 00:08:04.80
So anyway, they went up to Indiana and are you born yet at this point? Not yet.

74
00:08:04.80 --> 00:08:11.28
Oh, no, yeah. My older sister is about to be on her way. And he took a job with one of the

75
00:08:11.28 --> 00:08:15.76
companies who made parts for general motors, right? All that area up there, Indianapolis,

76
00:08:15.76 --> 00:08:21.92
Detroit, everything. They didn't solve general motors for so many so far. And after three or four

77
00:08:21.92 --> 00:08:26.24
years of being up there, he did a couple of things. He got like his pilot's license and

78
00:08:26.24 --> 00:08:32.32
um, which apparently, that then you didn't actually have to have. There were dudes flying

79
00:08:32.32 --> 00:08:36.08
airplane. They were flying airplane. They were flying airplanes while drinking liquor and stuff.

80
00:08:36.08 --> 00:08:39.68
The stories that they used to tell us, right? There were small news that flying these little

81
00:08:39.68 --> 00:08:44.32
supercubs and peppercubs around and you know, he was talking about shooting, you know,

82
00:08:44.32 --> 00:08:49.20
doing aerial, you know, shooting foxes and stuff. I'm like, these crazy suckers were doing

83
00:08:49.20 --> 00:08:54.000
aerial sniper shit with freaking hunting rifles and shotguns. You know, he's like, yeah,

84
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.16
you know, there's little supercubs of fly so slow that you could shoot, you know, coyotes and

85
00:08:58.16 --> 00:09:03.44
foxes and deal with a shotgun. And I'm like, all about drinking, he's like, you know, it's like,

86
00:09:03.44 --> 00:09:09.04
you guys really not. So I joke that you know, when we're all out, you know, thinking we're cool,

87
00:09:09.04 --> 00:09:15.52
shooting out of a helicopter, bunch of redneck days, but you know, for a long time. But yeah,

88
00:09:15.52 --> 00:09:23.36
so you know, man, some affirmative action policies, my dad got pushed over for some promotions

89
00:09:23.36 --> 00:09:27.92
over those years and like he should have been a supervisory role. He was like, you know,

90
00:09:27.92 --> 00:09:32.72
people are getting promoted that have less time or less qualification. Got, got disgruntled with the whole

91
00:09:33.92 --> 00:09:39.20
manufacturing world. I would call it corporate per se manufacturing, you know, and it's like,

92
00:09:39.20 --> 00:09:44.64
I, well, they moved back down to Carolina where my mother was from. And he took a job with a seafood

93
00:09:44.64 --> 00:09:51.04
company. It's right on the Pamela co-sound. So dox, food and seafood will come off the boats there.

94
00:09:51.04 --> 00:09:55.84
They package process it, send it to restaurants. A few years later, he bought that company.

95
00:09:56.48 --> 00:10:02.24
So at this point, my older sister's born, I was born in this little timeframe there. And,

96
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:08.88
you know, by like, so I was born in 76, so by 82, the business is doing good, you know, so

97
00:10:09.52 --> 00:10:14.72
and I'm old enough to be aware of it. And, you know, I've got to older sister in a younger sister.

98
00:10:14.72 --> 00:10:23.04
So when my dad needed help, guess who the laborer was, you know. So, you know, but I'll tell you

99
00:10:23.04 --> 00:10:27.92
my dad, you know, my dad wasn't like, you know, by today's parenting standards, my dad was a horrible

100
00:10:27.92 --> 00:10:36.000
father. Right? Like, he wasn't that nice to me. He wasn't the love EW, you know, hugs and kisses type.

101
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.48
But he wasn't abusive either, right? Like, you know, I'd get a spanking if I deserved it. And I,

102
00:10:40.48 --> 00:10:46.64
looking back, I probably deserved everyone plus a few I didn't get. But, you know, he was, he wasn't

103
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:51.92
a very good teacher. Right? He was the type of guy, like, by today's standards, like, he was just,

104
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:59.60
he did it all wrong. But, you know, my older sister's a well-renowned pediatric and a chronologist.

105
00:10:59.60 --> 00:11:05.20
Right? Like, if you Google her name, you know, pretty amazing woman. Out of one of the most

106
00:11:05.20 --> 00:11:13.92
role underfunded school systems in America. My younger sister's successful social worker in

107
00:11:13.92 --> 00:11:18.72
Raleigh, she helps a lot of people with just amazing things. Of the three of us, she's the most

108
00:11:18.72 --> 00:11:25.92
left. I don't know that she would even vote for me. My older sister, she's in the moderate,

109
00:11:25.92 --> 00:11:32.000
my older sister's that, you know, that mother and America that was in the middle and kind of got

110
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.72
pushed into the left over the last, you know, four or five years. But she's, she's that person

111
00:11:38.72 --> 00:11:42.72
I talk about. We need to win them back. You know, she's conservatives, she was raised conservative,

112
00:11:42.72 --> 00:11:49.12
she grew up shooting, hunting, and everything I did. But anyway, my dad was at God. It was like,

113
00:11:49.12 --> 00:11:54.96
hey, look, you need to do this and you need to do this and you better have this done before I get home.

114
00:11:54.96 --> 00:12:00.88
I feel like God, I don't know how to do that stuff, figure it out. And at the time, I thought he was just

115
00:12:00.88 --> 00:12:05.52
an asshole. You know, I just thought he wasn't, didn't like me. I don't know, and that's me to me,

116
00:12:05.52 --> 00:12:10.32
blah, blah, whatever. Actually, I probably wasn't even aware. It's just how it was. Because most of

117
00:12:10.32 --> 00:12:14.72
the fathers in my neighborhood were very similar. And I grew up in one of the neighborhoods like if you

118
00:12:14.72 --> 00:12:20.16
were caught misbehaving down the street, you might get a spanking from the neighbor. Right? Like they

119
00:12:20.16 --> 00:12:26.24
were all family. Well, it's church together, you know, and then you get another one when we

120
00:12:26.24 --> 00:12:31.52
would dad go home. But you know, looking back, and he taught me so much, he taught me to figure it out.

121
00:12:31.52 --> 00:12:37.44
And kind of find out that was the whole point. He didn't care if I completed it, you know,

122
00:12:37.44 --> 00:12:42.64
at a hundred percent, you know, awesomeness or whatever, you know, he just wanted me to try.

123
00:12:42.64 --> 00:12:46.72
And it's not like these days, man, and someone gives you a task like, I'll just YouTube it.

124
00:12:46.72 --> 00:12:52.08
You know, it's right here in here. I'll just watch a video step by step. It'll be easy, you know?

125
00:12:52.08 --> 00:12:58.48
And we didn't have that growing up, right? So, if you just had an extension cord and the

126
00:12:58.48 --> 00:13:04.64
wicked skill saw, you know, the fact that I still have all my fingers and toes, because he let me

127
00:13:04.64 --> 00:13:10.80
handle tools that, right? So my employees slash in terms at the range with the company.

128
00:13:11.36 --> 00:13:16.72
And I, they have like training programs that have to go through. They can't just pick up one of my

129
00:13:16.72 --> 00:13:21.84
chain solves, right? You chop your leg off with a chain saw like that circular saws, right? Like,

130
00:13:21.84 --> 00:13:28.08
that was like, yeah, man, just get it done welding. I learned it well because if I broke something,

131
00:13:28.08 --> 00:13:32.56
I better have it fixed before you got home. It looked like a big pile of tube bubble gum,

132
00:13:32.56 --> 00:13:38.08
but, you know, as long as it would hold the go home. Yeah. So that was kind of my childhood,

133
00:13:38.08 --> 00:13:44.56
man. And it was so many lessons learned. I watched my dad build this business from nothing to,

134
00:13:44.56 --> 00:13:49.44
you know, took us to a comfortable, I wouldn't say upper middle class, but, you know,

135
00:13:49.44 --> 00:13:53.52
slightly above average middle class, you know, especially for rural North Carolina,

136
00:13:53.52 --> 00:14:00.40
class of living is not huge. And he, at Balsam property, developed a piece of property

137
00:14:01.44 --> 00:14:06.08
into a subdivision on the water down there, one of the, one of the really first subdivisions

138
00:14:07.36 --> 00:14:12.56
in that era in Pamico County when there was a lot of resistance for change, right? People don't

139
00:14:12.56 --> 00:14:17.92
woo, we don't want to be Yankees coming down here, buying up our, you know, riverfront property,

140
00:14:17.92 --> 00:14:23.76
right? And so he got a lot of pushback. And I remember that was my probably my first exposure,

141
00:14:23.76 --> 00:14:28.000
you know, he would come home from a county commission and meet and, and these are all people we know,

142
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.52
right? There's 12,500 people in Pamico County and has been for like 80 years, right? Like,

143
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:37.68
the population doesn't change because it's actually a amount of people that move there or are

144
00:14:37.68 --> 00:14:45.76
born there, die or leave. Yeah. So yeah, man, um, it was really cool. That's when I learned to

145
00:14:45.76 --> 00:14:52.96
run like large machinery. At 12, 13 years old, my dad had me running a D6 bulldozer. Like what?

146
00:14:53.36 --> 00:14:57.52
We were putting the culverts in for the road, right? We built the roads in this place. You're laying

147
00:14:57.52 --> 00:15:04.48
layers and layers of gravel. So we bought a D3, a D6, excavator, a back of all this stuff.

148
00:15:04.48 --> 00:15:08.08
I can't even reach the pedals on these pieces of equipment. I'm out there running them.

149
00:15:08.96 --> 00:15:14.56
Without a lot of instruction, you know, or any instruction just go. Yeah. And I'll never forget,

150
00:15:14.56 --> 00:15:19.60
you know, putting a big concrete tiles into the, you know, the ditches for the road.

151
00:15:20.40 --> 00:15:23.60
I'm on the back house, steering these things in and he's in that ditch.

152
00:15:24.16 --> 00:15:28.08
They're talking thousand pound concrete tiles. If I make a mistake, I would have killed him.

153
00:15:28.08 --> 00:15:34.000
Oh yeah. Looking back, I would have never trusted me. I wouldn't have gotten that ditch, but he did.

154
00:15:34.56 --> 00:15:39.84
And I was like, wow, you know, either A and my dad was a complete cycle. Right? Um, which, you know,

155
00:15:40.72 --> 00:15:46.40
he's one of those guys like mission men, we will get it done. Being in the rain in the military,

156
00:15:46.40 --> 00:15:51.12
not a big deal. Because my dad was like, it would, there was that local little restaurant in town where

157
00:15:51.12 --> 00:15:56.48
everybody ate breakfast all the men, you know. And it'd be raining. And I'm like, all right, we got to go.

158
00:15:56.48 --> 00:15:59.60
And I'm like, oh, working in the rain today is like, I don't get to choose the weather.

159
00:16:00.16 --> 00:16:07.28
Now, it's his attitude, man. He was just a tough motho, and just hard hours upon hours of work,

160
00:16:07.28 --> 00:16:13.04
you know. And I like to say I'm a decent balance between him and my mother who was, you know,

161
00:16:13.04 --> 00:16:19.12
the more gentle, I mean, she was, she wanted to, a post by any means, right? Like, she didn't

162
00:16:19.12 --> 00:16:23.76
put up with none of my BS. I, she, I probably got more spankings from her and I ever did him, right?

163
00:16:23.76 --> 00:16:29.04
You know, but like, you know, little pops on the, on the ass or whatever. You got more quality from the old man,

164
00:16:29.04 --> 00:16:35.60
but why are you from that? You know? And some people would say that, I was, I was my mom was baby boy, right?

165
00:16:35.60 --> 00:16:40.96
I was the only boy. I mean, that was different. You know, my older sister, man, she's like,

166
00:16:40.96 --> 00:16:45.68
she's like a T-1000. She's the first version of the Terminator, dude. She is like,

167
00:16:45.68 --> 00:16:50.32
when people meet her, they're like, whoa, dude, I thought you were in terms. No, my older sister's a

168
00:16:50.32 --> 00:16:56.08
machine. I said it was probably like five or six people in this planet. I'm, I'm afraid of,

169
00:16:56.08 --> 00:17:02.24
she's one of them. You know what I mean? Like, there's a handful of guys. We're all, you know,

170
00:17:02.24 --> 00:17:06.16
pretty tough dudes, right? You know, you can hold our own and all that kind of stuff. But there's

171
00:17:06.16 --> 00:17:10.80
all of us have that handful of guys that you're like, you know, like, I was kind of scary.

172
00:17:10.80 --> 00:17:16.96
One of those guys from these my older sister. And I'm not kidding, right? Like, uh, she's just,

173
00:17:16.96 --> 00:17:22.64
oh, man, she is what she is in a successful because of it. But yeah, man, you know,

174
00:17:22.64 --> 00:17:27.44
watching my dad build those businesses, develop that piece of property, really set that foundation.

175
00:17:28.24 --> 00:17:33.36
And, you know, since I was involved in so much of it, because he didn't have labor. You know,

176
00:17:33.36 --> 00:17:37.76
he didn't have help. So I had to be there. You know, I didn't get to play sports in school,

177
00:17:37.76 --> 00:17:42.96
like I wanted to because he needed help. And looking back in a lot of ways, those lessons just

178
00:17:42.96 --> 00:17:48.40
continued to carry over whether, you know, like, heck, when we were in the Afghanistan or right before

179
00:17:48.40 --> 00:17:52.40
we were going in the Afghanistan, we were at the F.O.B. You need equipment moved around. Yeah,

180
00:17:52.40 --> 00:17:56.08
I knew how to run Fortlifts. How do you think we moved Palace around in that seafood house?

181
00:17:57.12 --> 00:18:02.48
Fortlifts, you know, even that big crazy machine that grabs the connexes, I went and jacked one of those

182
00:18:02.48 --> 00:18:06.64
from the Air Force one time. We just went and moving around the entire lot, you know, they entire

183
00:18:06.64 --> 00:18:11.12
all the connexes, you know. It was like, hey, go get that and bring it over here next to our tent.

184
00:18:11.12 --> 00:18:16.08
So we can pack out, get ready to infill. Well, I could do all that when we got in the Afghanistan,

185
00:18:16.08 --> 00:18:21.36
you know, I knew how the little local tractor that the fellow had, you know, we needed it to

186
00:18:22.16 --> 00:18:26.24
move some stuff around with tunnels like, yeah, you know, I can run that. So that foundation was

187
00:18:26.24 --> 00:18:31.04
huge. But more than any of the actual stuff that I did at the moment, what he taught me was that I can

188
00:18:31.04 --> 00:18:37.36
do anything. If you put your mind into it, it's just like selection. I don't remember selection being

189
00:18:37.36 --> 00:18:42.72
that difficult, you know, it was just like I had this mission and it just had to be done. I mean,

190
00:18:42.72 --> 00:18:48.32
I had, you know, he couldn't really afford all three of us going to college, you know.

191
00:18:49.68 --> 00:18:55.28
He was struggling a little bit. My mother died when I was 16. I was after that. I went

192
00:18:56.32 --> 00:19:02.16
I went to misbehaving. How did your mother die? Cancer. Yeah, four year about with it, man.

193
00:19:02.16 --> 00:19:06.24
And ultimately it wasn't really the cancer to kill, or it was a surgery.

194
00:19:06.24 --> 00:19:09.04
Complications from a surgery. So it's kind of heartbreaking. Like,

195
00:19:10.32 --> 00:19:15.04
yes, she had been fighting at or whatever. Really, you know, the struggle back then was chemo,

196
00:19:15.04 --> 00:19:19.84
which it still is. But, you know, you're talking in the early 90s, man, for a chemo, we're rough.

197
00:19:19.84 --> 00:19:25.84
And so I learned a lot from watching her deal with it, man. She, she would get up and walk and

198
00:19:25.84 --> 00:19:31.76
exercise and working to yard and mo the yard, you know, while having to stop and throw up from chemo.

199
00:19:31.76 --> 00:19:39.12
Yeah, so one of the toughest people I ever grew up with was my mother. And yeah, so after she passed

200
00:19:39.12 --> 00:19:45.68
man, you know, I started being that bad kid, you know, and smoking weed, wound up doing a little

201
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:52.88
blow, whatever, freaking gotten trouble, you know. Where'd you get trouble with like school?

202
00:19:52.88 --> 00:19:56.08
Yeah, you're schooled the law. Yeah, I got arrested, man, for you can,

203
00:19:56.08 --> 00:20:02.88
and luckily, you know, it was all just minor dumb stuff, right? It was not like I was a, you know,

204
00:20:02.88 --> 00:20:08.64
dealing anything or stuff like that. I wasn't, you know, making money off of it, just party and,

205
00:20:08.64 --> 00:20:13.44
you know, just doing dumb redneck stuff, you know, like hunting club roads, you know,

206
00:20:13.44 --> 00:20:16.80
you don't want to get on a road, you get a DWI, but we can ride around these hunting club,

207
00:20:16.80 --> 00:20:23.60
dirt roads, redneck stuff, you know, drink beer and, you know, and, you know, do all the dumb stuff

208
00:20:23.60 --> 00:20:27.36
we were doing. And that was when you're still in high school? Yeah. So yeah, I'm not seeing

209
00:20:27.36 --> 00:20:32.80
you in high school, you know, just being bad. And, but I was still making good enough grades.

210
00:20:34.72 --> 00:20:40.16
Excuse me. Yeah, I was, you know, just, you know, the deal, man, just how, like everyone

211
00:20:40.16 --> 00:20:45.76
in software, all pretty smart news, we can get bees without really trying. And any course we go to,

212
00:20:45.76 --> 00:20:50.80
you know, most of us are bees students and every course, and of course, there's always that one

213
00:20:50.80 --> 00:20:56.96
nerd over there to get to honor that. You know, and whatever, like fun of that guy, what a nerd.

214
00:20:56.96 --> 00:21:01.84
Yeah, I wasn't the nerd. I was a misbehaved kid just being a jackass for me.

215
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:05.04
And you didn't play any sports because you were working too hard. Well, I did play a little bit,

216
00:21:05.04 --> 00:21:10.16
but like, with Drew from, you know, the team and senior year, stuff like that, just,

217
00:21:10.16 --> 00:21:16.32
just because, yeah, man, he needed help after working. And, um, we still do after high school. Yeah,

218
00:21:16.32 --> 00:21:23.04
man, so, you know, also our, man, we were the smallest school system and right next door to us

219
00:21:23.04 --> 00:21:28.88
is like West Craven. You know, that's a school that's producing, you know, pro football players,

220
00:21:28.88 --> 00:21:34.000
you know, DH Conley, over in Greenville, ECU, you know, big schools, man. And we were like,

221
00:21:34.72 --> 00:21:40.000
they're like, we'll let Pamela go play us and they would just destroy us. You know, they had like

222
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
defense and offense and in special teams. We had a football team. You didn't leave the field, man.

223
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.80
And then it was times we went to football games, we didn't have enough dudes, you know,

224
00:21:48.80 --> 00:21:52.88
we were a whole play. And, you know, so after, you know, a couple years of that, man, I wasn't

225
00:21:52.88 --> 00:21:57.36
really interested, you know, it's like, what's the point? I mean, you know, the average student

226
00:21:57.36 --> 00:22:01.76
on our team, you know, we had that one 220 pound guy where you got a West Craven there and tire

227
00:22:01.76 --> 00:22:07.28
lineups 200 plus pounds. We would just, they would mock the floor with us. So I lost this,

228
00:22:07.28 --> 00:22:12.48
just to not just started working more and partying more. And yeah, man. So good enough grades to get

229
00:22:12.48 --> 00:22:19.36
into NC State, I look at how I'm like, I still don't know how they let me in. You know, not good enough

230
00:22:19.36 --> 00:22:25.60
grades to get any kind of scholarship. So, you know, after the second year, my younger sister's only

231
00:22:25.60 --> 00:22:31.04
year behind me, my older sister is four years ahead of me. She's entering medical school. Where

232
00:22:31.04 --> 00:22:36.40
she'd go to school? She went to medical school at ECU. Where'd she go to undergrad at UNC

233
00:22:36.40 --> 00:22:45.76
Chapel Hill? Yeah. So, you know, Dad's paying out of pocket plus he's still very much, you know,

234
00:22:45.76 --> 00:22:49.76
dealing with the death of my mom. And he had a really hard time, man. For he can, you know,

235
00:22:50.48 --> 00:22:54.64
I watched him lose a lot of weight, you know, he'd and talked to people, he kept working,

236
00:22:54.64 --> 00:22:59.20
you know, and he worked more, which was already done there in possible. And you know, being a young

237
00:22:59.20 --> 00:23:05.76
dumb punk kid, I couldn't recognize it because I'm selfish, like kids are. And I'm looking back

238
00:23:05.76 --> 00:23:10.48
I was like, man, I could have been a better kid, I could have been a better son to him. But I mean,

239
00:23:10.48 --> 00:23:15.60
we were kids, we were young and I hadn't looking back, man. I'm mom talking to the number one

240
00:23:15.60 --> 00:23:23.28
best lesson in my entire life. And that is everyone you know is going to die. Right? So, as we

241
00:23:23.28 --> 00:23:29.44
entered that war, I had already lost and I tried to use that terminology. One of the people

242
00:23:29.44 --> 00:23:38.000
was closest to me in my life. And so that set me up for being able to deal with how many of our

243
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.12
brothers got killed close friends and so on and so forth. You know, our partner forces, you know,

244
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.24
I don't think guys always realize how tight we get with those partner forces, you know, I got

245
00:23:50.24 --> 00:23:56.96
some of my best friends on this planet are, you know, Muslims. People don't always understand that,

246
00:23:56.96 --> 00:24:01.52
you know, especially in Iraq where I worked with the Kurds for years, the same tune of dudes

247
00:24:01.52 --> 00:24:09.44
for seven, eight years. And so anyway, her passing taught me to appreciate why you have them.

248
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.44
And that's why I don't use that terminology, you'll lost them. I didn't lose my mother. I can go

249
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:21.68
show you right now where she rests. I know exactly where she's at. So I didn't lose them.

250
00:24:21.68 --> 00:24:27.92
It was a gain. Right. If someone in your life is so tight with you that when they die, it breaks

251
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:34.96
your heart. Right? You didn't lose anything. You gained something in life. Because if, if when we

252
00:24:35.60 --> 00:24:40.96
understand that everyone we know in love, they're going to die. When you start thinking like that,

253
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:48.000
you start appreciating them every day. You know? So I can say, my mom told me the best lesson

254
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.04
that I've ever had. And it set me up or success in the war. And don't get me wrong. It doesn't

255
00:24:53.04 --> 00:25:00.32
mean like I'm somehow callous or, you know, immune to filling sad and upset. You know, there's

256
00:25:00.32 --> 00:25:04.16
still those antivarsaries. There's thoughts, you know, those memories that pop back up,

257
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:08.56
to make us all upset, you know, and tear up and, you know, and so on and so forth. But

258
00:25:09.12 --> 00:25:16.000
and then freaking without her death, I don't know that now today, I would be as healthy mentally as I am.

259
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.72
You know, it just laid that foundation. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and I tell people at all

260
00:25:22.72 --> 00:25:28.64
a time and I have throughout, you know, once I realized that and I'll tell you, it really probably

261
00:25:28.64 --> 00:25:35.12
number one thing that really woke me up 2013 and April 2013. My best friend was getting,

262
00:25:35.12 --> 00:25:41.76
I had gotten in Ben Bittner. Ben was better than everyone else. He was that cocky little little

263
00:25:41.76 --> 00:25:46.64
girl. That guy, you know, who everything could make it up to you. He was just better than

264
00:25:46.64 --> 00:25:54.56
everybody else. He wasn't huge or jack, but he was strong and fast and so anyway, man, I got that

265
00:25:54.56 --> 00:25:59.20
phone call. I mean, Melissa hadn't been dating very long. We were driving up 540. It was kind of early

266
00:25:59.20 --> 00:26:03.76
on a Sunday morning. I got a phone call. So I hit this, you know, hey, bro, Ben Bittner. Okay.

267
00:26:04.80 --> 00:26:09.92
Dude, put off the side of row and threw up because of one dude I thought that was truly

268
00:26:09.92 --> 00:26:18.96
immoral, right? Just got suckered by the enemy and abated ambush, right? And if had not been,

269
00:26:18.96 --> 00:26:23.92
it was, I mean, that's 13, man. We're 12 years into the war. I mean, already got plenty of memorial

270
00:26:23.92 --> 00:26:28.72
braces, you know, but for something about when Ben died, it was like holy crap, we're not immortal.

271
00:26:29.28 --> 00:26:35.20
You know, I'd been injured, blown up, you know, how it is. As a young little trooper, sometimes,

272
00:26:35.20 --> 00:26:42.32
right, those close calls, they make you more arrogant and cocky, right? You know, you start thinking

273
00:26:42.32 --> 00:26:47.52
that you can get away with more and more and that's probably where I was in 13. When I got

274
00:26:47.52 --> 00:26:53.68
blown up in 2009, like after my recovery, I went back, meaner, more aggressive. You know,

275
00:26:55.68 --> 00:27:00.56
probably taking risks that I shouldn't have, you know, looking back, taking risks with my teams

276
00:27:00.56 --> 00:27:07.92
and my partner forces lives just because I was emotionally wanting some retribution, you know,

277
00:27:07.92 --> 00:27:14.64
they killed some of my teammates and damn near killed me and then Ben died. I was like holy shit.

278
00:27:14.64 --> 00:27:18.88
But like I said, without my mom's death, I don't know that I would have dealt with any of it very well.

279
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.60
So yeah, man, in C state, I like to say that I was enrolled at in C state.

280
00:27:25.60 --> 00:27:34.24
So your participation level is low. Well, there's panic of county and there's like, you know,

281
00:27:34.96 --> 00:27:39.76
my graduating class is like 104 people. So let's say there was, you know, 55, 60 girls in that

282
00:27:39.76 --> 00:27:46.80
class, right? And then I get the NC state. There's girls everywhere. They were everywhere. I was like,

283
00:27:46.80 --> 00:27:55.12
holy crap, man. There's like thousands of them. And yeah, so I was distracted to say the least. And,

284
00:27:56.16 --> 00:28:00.08
you know, I quickly found out that classrooms where you have to be quiet and pay attention to a

285
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:05.60
professor and not the best place to talk to these girls. So why would I waste my time going to those classes?

286
00:28:06.72 --> 00:28:12.72
And so anyway, for you can impartian, waste and money, you know, that that we didn't have.

287
00:28:12.72 --> 00:28:17.44
My sisters in med school, now my younger sisters, going to school, she went,

288
00:28:17.44 --> 00:28:23.60
it was going down at, you know, at C Wilmington. And, you know, it was clear, you know, that I was wasting

289
00:28:23.60 --> 00:28:30.16
money. I didn't have it. I didn't have it. So I withdrew. I joined the army. You know,

290
00:28:30.88 --> 00:28:35.28
was that your first time thinking about joining the army? Absolutely not. I didn't want to go to college.

291
00:28:35.28 --> 00:28:40.08
Right. And, you know, our generation, we have to blame our parents for everything. So my dad let me

292
00:28:40.08 --> 00:28:45.60
watch Rambo first blood when I was nine or ten years old. Done to be high. That was green braised.

293
00:28:45.60 --> 00:28:50.40
They were real badasses. You know, says it right now, movie. And, you know, so from there,

294
00:28:50.40 --> 00:28:55.36
when you're like, let's face it, right? Like, some guys watch, you know, something has got seals in it.

295
00:28:55.36 --> 00:28:59.76
And they're like, oh, yeah, or some guys will watch, you know, the recom movie with Clint Eastwood.

296
00:28:59.76 --> 00:29:03.92
And, you know, and you're impressed, and at a young point, when mine was Rambo first blood. And,

297
00:29:03.92 --> 00:29:10.000
freaking out, you know, running around above the snow line. Rats in the caves. I was like, yeah, I was already

298
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.80
playing in the woods all the time. Anyway, I loved it. I know I had just man. So from there on out, yeah,

299
00:29:14.80 --> 00:29:19.60
I just went on this funny green hats, which is looking back. I'm like, damn that hat's up.

300
00:29:20.24 --> 00:29:25.36
It's made out of wool. It's hard. It's hell, right? Like, you want me to wear this wool hat in Fayetteville?

301
00:29:25.36 --> 00:29:29.84
You know, I mean, you're almost the reason to summertime the sand hills on the little Carolina.

302
00:29:29.84 --> 00:29:33.92
All right, like, this hat's dumb. There's no bill it then keep the sun out of your face. There's

303
00:29:33.92 --> 00:29:38.96
not like a boonie cat. There's no ballistic protection. Why are we even wearing this dumb hat?

304
00:29:38.96 --> 00:29:45.52
All right? Like, anyway, um, but yeah, that's what I wanted. And I didn't help. I met a fellow

305
00:29:45.52 --> 00:29:52.16
named Jason McKenzie at NC State and he was going green to gold. And he started telling me,

306
00:29:52.16 --> 00:29:58.24
I was here for my green. Yeah, he was a GB at the time. And he was getting his commission.

307
00:29:58.24 --> 00:30:02.32
And he went on to get his commission. Go back to the 18th of course, and then when I went over to the

308
00:30:02.32 --> 00:30:09.84
unit, freaking stud, he was a stud. Real smart dude. Still it. And um, and I was like, started talking to him.

309
00:30:09.84 --> 00:30:16.40
He was like, hey, look, Brown, I get it. College socks. Let me tell you about this really cool secret.

310
00:30:16.40 --> 00:30:21.28
It's a card that's called the National Guard Special Forces Groups. And I was like, what?

311
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.32
How is that even possible? How can you have a reserve special operations? We'll come to find out.

312
00:30:26.32 --> 00:30:34.08
Most all of those have that. And uh, it is the coolest, most least known way to get in the special forces.

313
00:30:34.08 --> 00:30:38.000
And I'm like, what do you mean? You know, I wear the lights. I know. And he's like, yeah, man.

314
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.28
So, basically, you go in and it's just like an active duty group. I mean, they just, you know,

315
00:30:43.28 --> 00:30:48.000
less bullshit. And that's really what it almost comes down to. It's like, the guard gets on orders.

316
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.52
It's not like they're doing, you know, one week in a month, two weeks a year type of thing. You know,

317
00:30:51.52 --> 00:30:57.84
they're doing weeks of training at a time. If when they deploy, it's, you know, months of work up,

318
00:30:57.84 --> 00:31:02.24
PMT, just like the group. I have to check all the same boxes just in a lot less time.

319
00:31:03.36 --> 00:31:07.52
And I'm like, okay, yeah, he's like, how's it work? He's like, well, you know, he's got me all hooked

320
00:31:07.52 --> 00:31:14.16
up with 19th group. The guy's up in West Virginia. I had to get a waiver for my misbehaviors and a rest,

321
00:31:14.16 --> 00:31:18.48
right? And I remember, uh, what year is this? So this is uh, 97.

322
00:31:18.48 --> 00:31:24.000
And it was a hard-gitten waivers? It was it. Were you a minor when you got arrested?

323
00:31:24.56 --> 00:31:32.40
No, uh, yes, and uh, both. Okay. I had just turned 18. Um, um,

324
00:31:32.40 --> 00:31:37.84
one of the arrests. I was still senior in high school. And uh, but everything else was before that.

325
00:31:39.20 --> 00:31:46.56
And uh, now I'm in freaking, so I go and talk to these guys and Colonel Hoyer was the

326
00:31:46.56 --> 00:31:51.92
batonic commander for the second baton of 19th special forces group. And he moved on to become like the

327
00:31:51.92 --> 00:31:59.68
the general, the tag of West Virginia, really smart man, really smart guy. And um, not a very imposing

328
00:31:59.68 --> 00:32:06.72
figure, um, you know, just an average-looking guy, guy that could throw a suit on and disappear, you know,

329
00:32:06.72 --> 00:32:11.60
uh, not the jack tattoo guys. Of course, tattoos on the sleeves and all that weren't quite

330
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:17.60
populated time. And I remember walking in and thinking, this is a special forces Colonel. I was expecting

331
00:32:17.60 --> 00:32:22.32
you're like John the Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Captain, from Rainbow, right? He's supposed

332
00:32:22.32 --> 00:32:26.96
to scare the shit out of me. Very on a suit, in which come to find out later. Yeah, those are the

333
00:32:26.96 --> 00:32:32.96
dudes that are really the scary guys. Anyway, when he was like, um, yeah, so you need a waiver.

334
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:39.36
You're gonna do this anymore? I'm like, no, sir. Done with that. I was, you know, three years ago,

335
00:32:39.36 --> 00:32:49.84
um, good. Okay. Boom. That easy, you know. And and had he, in his assessment, for whatever reason,

336
00:32:49.84 --> 00:32:54.56
you know, um, because I know him to have turned down some of our cases. But man, it was that was

337
00:32:54.56 --> 00:33:00.24
no interview. Nothing. He just took me on a very first impression basis. And I was just a dumb kid.

338
00:33:00.24 --> 00:33:04.40
I didn't know. I'm like scared to death. All these GBs, you know. I'm like, you know, I'm trying to

339
00:33:04.40 --> 00:33:10.08
join this very exclusive club. And I don't know what to say. I don't know how to act. So nothing,

340
00:33:10.08 --> 00:33:15.44
I would have done it. I would have been right anyway. But yeah, you gave me the waivers. I was

341
00:33:15.44 --> 00:33:20.56
drew from school on a Tuesday morning. I, you know, Riley to Pamela Kirkandley to the house,

342
00:33:20.56 --> 00:33:24.96
is about two hours. I went home. I died once at home. I was okay. Changing to some PT's and went

343
00:33:24.96 --> 00:33:30.96
for a run. Sure enough, many on the road. He like hits the braces like, what the fuck? Are you doing?

344
00:33:30.96 --> 00:33:35.28
Why are you home? You're supposed to be in college, boy. What's wrong with you? And you're

345
00:33:35.28 --> 00:33:39.92
he knew at this point like, oh, something's up. Right? Like this ain't right. You know,

346
00:33:39.92 --> 00:33:44.72
a great, he's probably in trouble again. That was probably his first impression. I'm like,

347
00:33:44.72 --> 00:33:49.84
I'll run to the house. That'll meet in there. He probably would have pulled over to the side of the

348
00:33:49.84 --> 00:33:54.24
road and got out. And we would have had that discussion on side of the road. But my stepmother,

349
00:33:54.24 --> 00:33:59.60
he luckily, I'd be Lord man, luckily for my dad. He met an amazing woman after my mom died.

350
00:33:59.60 --> 00:34:06.24
And who became one of my very best friends. Sad story. She died a cancer too. My dad, man,

351
00:34:06.24 --> 00:34:10.88
God blesses all of it. So my stepmother's with him. And I remember she kind of like patented

352
00:34:10.88 --> 00:34:15.28
him on the shoulder and was like, let him come home and talk to us. You know, come at that

353
00:34:15.28 --> 00:34:20.40
wasn't a little dude either. Right? Like he's, you know, about my size. Now, right? I was always

354
00:34:20.40 --> 00:34:24.96
small in him until I finally started lifting some weights. I was actually way more of a runner-dead

355
00:34:24.96 --> 00:34:31.04
early on. I was like, about 70. You know, I could run. I had no real weight on me, you know, but he was

356
00:34:31.04 --> 00:34:37.92
like two, two, ten. You know, he's a strong dude, a worker guy. Yeah, he boxed about

357
00:34:37.92 --> 00:34:42.96
only 18th every one for the few times we did, scuff it up a little bit. Yeah, he just made

358
00:34:42.96 --> 00:34:50.32
one for me up. Right. I just covered up. But you know, like I said, anyway, man, freaking uh, yeah.

359
00:34:50.32 --> 00:34:55.76
So I go to the house and I tell him he's just shaking his head, but it's like he understood. You

360
00:34:55.76 --> 00:35:01.68
know, he understood. He knew, I mean, of course I'm in something new me. I'm his, he joined the

361
00:35:01.68 --> 00:35:07.44
80 second hour board of the same reason I wanted to go. So yeah, man, um, a few weeks later I was

362
00:35:07.44 --> 00:35:12.96
in base of training back quick, huh? Yeah, yeah. It was like two and a half months from the time I

363
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:17.60
signed up, I was already in base of training because back then, you know, late 90s recruitment was

364
00:35:17.60 --> 00:35:22.64
out of pre-low there, the administration and they'd routed the military and cut so much funding.

365
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:27.68
But trying to get guys to sign up for combat arms, you know, the recruiter would be like,

366
00:35:27.68 --> 00:35:32.80
hey, yeah, signing my right up. Come on in here, you know. So yeah, did that? Um,

367
00:35:32.80 --> 00:35:37.76
that was boot camp. I was in such a good shape that it was like easy. I think I got

368
00:35:37.76 --> 00:35:43.04
more shape when I got. I was already getting like a 340 on the Army's PT test. Right. And a lot

369
00:35:43.04 --> 00:35:46.32
of it was, you know, I could max the push up and sit ups, but my runtime was like, I was

370
00:35:46.32 --> 00:35:53.44
around like 11 flat two miles and I'm just a little runny. Right. And, uh, and skinny, God bless

371
00:35:53.44 --> 00:35:57.52
one, how I look back at some of the impakers been like, wow, wow, boy, you need to eat.

372
00:35:58.96 --> 00:36:04.000
Did you, you never ran like competitively? No, in high school or anything? No, no, I didn't

373
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.12
start running. I joined the ROT scene at NC State because, you know, okay, maybe I want to join

374
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:14.000
them. I mean, but, you know, maybe I'll be an officer. Yeah, you know, that didn't really play out that way.

375
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.28
But that was the first time I started doing PT and running. And I think like my first PT test

376
00:36:19.28 --> 00:36:24.96
had must have run like a 15 minute 2 mile, but like my second one was sub 12. Yeah, so apparently

377
00:36:24.96 --> 00:36:32.64
had some decent pre-disposition genetic pre-disposition the running. And the shock of boot camp was

378
00:36:32.64 --> 00:36:37.20
no factor because you were just stoked to be there. Right. Yeah. And, you know, at this point now,

379
00:36:37.20 --> 00:36:42.48
I'm 20. So I'm one of the oldest kids in basic training. And I'm even back then, I'm looking

380
00:36:42.48 --> 00:36:47.60
around doing, looking like these are a bunch of posts. Where are these kids come from? Right? Like

381
00:36:47.60 --> 00:36:52.08
clearly they didn't work like, you know, my dad, you know, in my head, I think every American boy's

382
00:36:52.08 --> 00:36:58.08
like me, you know, and others he's city kids and whatever man, yeah, but, but, but basically it wasn't

383
00:36:58.08 --> 00:37:03.28
hard. I mean, I got like, you know, top PT and you know, it was a quickly made like the stupid

384
00:37:03.28 --> 00:37:09.04
platoon sergeant or whatever and I was like, you know, and you know, there was a little click,

385
00:37:09.04 --> 00:37:14.000
you know, because I did the basic and AIT back to bags. It was like 14 weeks. So you same drill sergeant

386
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.92
all the way through by the end. Me and these couple other boys are a little bit older, a little bit

387
00:37:18.56 --> 00:37:23.60
more mature, you know, we were running things. We had our own little mafia going, you know, we had

388
00:37:24.88 --> 00:37:32.16
when they let us clean the drill sergeant's office, we took the key, snuck off post, made a coughing,

389
00:37:32.16 --> 00:37:38.64
a copy of it. So now I had a drill sergeant's office key, which had all our personal bags and the

390
00:37:38.64 --> 00:37:43.60
right, like, so we would go in there and listen to the walkman and CDs, you know, and like,

391
00:37:43.60 --> 00:37:48.40
hide out and it was funny because the drill sergeant had no idea we were doing it, much less

392
00:37:48.40 --> 00:37:52.16
that we were leaving post. I don't know, you can't leave post in basic training, there's no

393
00:37:52.16 --> 00:37:57.36
self like nowadays they can make phone calls and be on the internet, none of that, you're a lockdown, right?

394
00:37:58.56 --> 00:38:02.64
We were sticking off post and like, because we had access to the civilian clothes.

395
00:38:02.64 --> 00:38:07.84
I was thinking I'll post going in by and beer and it's stashin it. In the drill sergeant's office,

396
00:38:07.84 --> 00:38:13.20
in the personal right, we going there at night and how is a few beers, you know, buy some liquor,

397
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.20
no clue. So I always say like, I was already running an underground in auxiliary when I was in

398
00:38:19.20 --> 00:38:25.68
basic training, like, that was just, you know, where I was just. I mean, I got out of there and

399
00:38:25.68 --> 00:38:34.64
um, freaking immediately went to the little progression course or whatever PLDC where you had to go

400
00:38:34.64 --> 00:38:41.68
from, you know, to get your promotion to E4 or whatever. And it was like a couple of days before I finished

401
00:38:41.68 --> 00:38:46.64
that little three week course. So you already E4 after like a few months? I know, I'm still in E3.

402
00:38:47.68 --> 00:38:51.20
Finished because I did have a little bit of college. I was finished basic as an E3.

403
00:38:51.20 --> 00:38:58.64
And so now I'm in a little PLDC course. So I can't get promoted E4. And like, hey, you ready to go to

404
00:38:58.64 --> 00:39:06.88
selection? I'm like, I guess, huh, win. And like, in two weeks, maybe I haven't won a rock side.

405
00:39:08.24 --> 00:39:12.08
Right? And that's all our selection is. It's carrying a rock sack for 28 days.

406
00:39:12.88 --> 00:39:18.32
Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Because I'm like, I'm not going to say no. I'm not turning down a slot

407
00:39:18.32 --> 00:39:23.44
at SFAS. Looking back, I could have been like, hey, I really could stand another month of training.

408
00:39:23.44 --> 00:39:27.12
And it'd been like, okay, whatever, and put me in the next course. I didn't know it like that.

409
00:39:27.12 --> 00:39:31.28
I thought just an opportunity at selection must have been a God soon. You can't say no.

410
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:34.80
So I had a whopping two weeks to train for selection.

411
00:39:37.20 --> 00:39:40.80
It went straight there, you know. And even then I look back and I'm like,

412
00:39:40.80 --> 00:39:44.64
wasn't really that hard. But it wasn't hard because quitting wasn't an option.

413
00:39:44.64 --> 00:39:46.80
Right. I couldn't have withdrawn from college.

414
00:39:46.80 --> 00:39:54.000
All the good, special forces and then fail. Right. That wouldn't have been a thing. I could not have

415
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.000
sold that to family members, my dad, right? Myself. How many people get, how many people make it through

416
00:40:02.64 --> 00:40:08.08
that first selection? What is it? 28 days you said? Back then, it was 28 days. Right. It's changed a lot

417
00:40:08.08 --> 00:40:15.28
over the years. I think right now it's 21 days of actual course. So maybe 26 days, counting the

418
00:40:15.28 --> 00:40:19.04
admin and all that. So it was 28 back then exactly four weeks.

419
00:40:21.20 --> 00:40:29.44
Yeah, there was 250 or so dudes in my class, 52 finished and 41 were selected.

420
00:40:30.16 --> 00:40:33.92
And I think a lot of folks don't know that, right? You can finish that course and I get picked up.

421
00:40:34.64 --> 00:40:42.32
28 day non-select. Yeah, that's got a hurt. I just got hurt. And so yeah, I got picked up.

422
00:40:42.32 --> 00:40:47.28
And most of those people are quitters or their performance drops are medical drops. So they hurt their knees.

423
00:40:49.84 --> 00:40:56.24
Yeah, you know, the number one attrition rate is voluntary withdrawals. That's probably 95% and then

424
00:40:56.24 --> 00:41:01.28
injury. And it's funny how seen some dudes and sure the same at Buds and everywhere else. You see those

425
00:41:01.28 --> 00:41:08.72
guys that like, they've got stress fractures, broken ankle, broken toes, torn, patellar tendons,

426
00:41:08.72 --> 00:41:15.52
and they finish. You know, I was just young and stupid man. I'm so lucky.

427
00:41:16.88 --> 00:41:23.28
I don't get blisters on my feet and never had. I got some of my first blisters ever last year hunting

428
00:41:23.28 --> 00:41:28.08
in the mountains of Idaho because I bought a pair of boots and didn't really break them in. I

429
00:41:28.08 --> 00:41:32.24
worn around and North Carolina working around the house and then I thought backpack going and

430
00:41:32.24 --> 00:41:38.000
go hiking in the mountains of Idaho. And I call it hiking. It was armed hiking because we didn't

431
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.88
kill any. It's not really hunting. It was just armed hiking. Really well armed hiking.

432
00:41:47.76 --> 00:41:51.84
Good training. I guess you could talk it up on this. But yeah, I'd never even gotten a blister like,

433
00:41:51.84 --> 00:41:56.72
you know. So I was lucky when it comes to that because that's a big thing in our selection.

434
00:41:56.72 --> 00:42:02.08
It's like, just dudes feet get turned to hamburger. What do you, how you know, a rough march if you

435
00:42:02.08 --> 00:42:08.72
didn't got feet? I was seeing some blisters that started the toes and then like the back of the heel.

436
00:42:08.72 --> 00:42:13.76
Really? Like things that like you could lose a leg at, oh, you know, in the medical like, whoa,

437
00:42:13.76 --> 00:42:17.44
you know, they have horrible, you know, in the little medics station and all those pictures.

438
00:42:17.44 --> 00:42:21.28
And you think it's just some genetic thing. You just don't get blisters. I just for whatever

439
00:42:21.28 --> 00:42:27.36
is my feet fit jungle boots, which is weird because it's not like they're, you know, I just did.

440
00:42:27.36 --> 00:42:34.88
So yeah, I mean, that just worked out finished selection. It was funny because at the time

441
00:42:35.68 --> 00:42:41.44
Regs said to finish it was before the 18 or the SF Baby program. The 18.

442
00:42:41.44 --> 00:42:47.76
Thanks for that. It was before that. But the guard had the back door. It was like the 18x

443
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:54.96
because I didn't go to any other unit. And so it's graduation day. I had to go to the strength

444
00:42:54.96 --> 00:42:59.36
and to the board a couple times because I was in E3 and they were like, you can't.

445
00:42:59.36 --> 00:43:03.28
You're not even supposed to be here much less finished. Like what though?

446
00:43:03.28 --> 00:43:09.04
We didn't know what to do with me. Again, some dudes looked at it, gave me a waiver.

447
00:43:09.04 --> 00:43:13.28
But it was funny because, you know, the company commander, company commander and the training

448
00:43:13.28 --> 00:43:17.44
SF training is not really involved in anything. He shows up, you know, he's an admin guy.

449
00:43:17.44 --> 00:43:23.20
I've been a most part the elicid boys run selection. So come time, you know, he's

450
00:43:23.20 --> 00:43:26.64
handing out, you know, his graduation, not very formal. It's out at Camp McCall.

451
00:43:26.64 --> 00:43:30.08
You're just all dirty and nasty and you're walking across the swill stage and he's handed out.

452
00:43:30.08 --> 00:43:34.64
He's like, staff sergeant, such and such. Captain, such and such. You sergeant, such and such.

453
00:43:34.64 --> 00:43:37.36
You know, hey, shaking hands and I get up there and he goes, private for it.

454
00:43:39.68 --> 00:43:43.68
He looks at the first sergeant and the whole class knows. We don't wear rank instead of there,

455
00:43:43.68 --> 00:43:48.08
but you know, right after four weeks, everyone knows who the cherry loot tenant is.

456
00:43:48.72 --> 00:43:52.24
And you know, there was some guys that are probably who were pissed that I was there as an

457
00:43:52.24 --> 00:43:57.20
unit three. But most of the guys were like, wow, this dude's crushing it and he's a baby,

458
00:43:57.20 --> 00:44:03.52
but I wasn't a child, you know, what an 18. You know, at least I ever jagging there like 24 or something.

459
00:44:03.52 --> 00:44:10.64
Yeah, very much so, you know, the average a senior E4 promotables, E5s and E6s made up the bulk of

460
00:44:10.64 --> 00:44:17.04
the class. And most of the officers were, you know, first lieutenant in captains. And so

461
00:44:17.04 --> 00:44:22.72
it was kind of funny because the whole class like laughing and clapping. You know, because the

462
00:44:22.72 --> 00:44:30.72
captain or the company commander in major was like, what the? You know, he talks to the first sergeant

463
00:44:30.72 --> 00:44:33.92
in the sergeant major and they're like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

464
00:44:33.92 --> 00:44:38.32
It's like really? And I'm like standing there on this day's way. Am I getting ready to get booted?

465
00:44:38.96 --> 00:44:44.32
You know, as a commander, gonna go, nope, right here. And so anyway, for he can shake my hands,

466
00:44:44.32 --> 00:44:48.08
he goes, all right, private first class, Calden, welcome to Regimen.

467
00:44:49.12 --> 00:44:53.84
All right on. So man, it was kind of screwed up. I was in a racing motorcross.

468
00:44:55.60 --> 00:45:01.92
One week before I was supposed to report to the Q-course, broke my femur, a couple ribs, my arm.

469
00:45:02.72 --> 00:45:07.76
Yeah, man, at a race that I shouldn't have been racing, are you not allowed to race it?

470
00:45:07.76 --> 00:45:11.84
No, you wouldn't like that, you know, you know, that wasn't on the list of things you can't do.

471
00:45:11.84 --> 00:45:15.36
You know, like, you know, it was a skydiving, you know, one never thought.

472
00:45:15.36 --> 00:45:19.20
He's not going to enter out there. Like, don't go right road you.

473
00:45:19.20 --> 00:45:23.52
It's on the list of things that you're not supposed to do while, you know, in the Q-course,

474
00:45:23.52 --> 00:45:26.24
wasn't in the Q-course yet, but motorcross wasn't on the list.

475
00:45:27.68 --> 00:45:31.68
Until I broke my femur, they added motorcycles to the list because of me.

476
00:45:32.96 --> 00:45:38.72
So, I had man, I, I, I missed my Q-course day. And I was supposed to go to the Delta course.

477
00:45:38.72 --> 00:45:46.24
I wanted to be a medic. Oddly enough, my plan was to go be a medic and either go to PA school or medical school.

478
00:45:46.24 --> 00:45:51.60
I wanted to be like my Terminator sister. I was the one that, I probably want to be a doctor more than she did.

479
00:45:52.64 --> 00:45:56.96
And I was always in the, you know, I wanted to be like the, you know, the ER doc. I want to be the trauma guy.

480
00:45:56.96 --> 00:46:03.12
So, 18 Delta just made sense. Well, eight months later, I'm still limping, you know, they put a rod, my leg,

481
00:46:03.12 --> 00:46:08.88
and all that, you know, I got my run times back down pretty good, but man, it hurt. It just hurt.

482
00:46:08.88 --> 00:46:13.76
Because I just destroyed this leg, man. It was like, you know, so I drove afterwards, you know,

483
00:46:13.76 --> 00:46:22.80
I put my hands around my claw. It was just a bone in there and it was nasty. Basically what happened was I over-jumped a triple jump.

484
00:46:22.80 --> 00:46:28.16
The jump got walled up and kicked the bike forward. My buds were standing in a very,

485
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:34.40
so they could see the drain plug on the bottom of the bike. The bike was pointing at the ground. I was still upright.

486
00:46:34.40 --> 00:46:38.56
When it hit the ground, the front tire basically trapped this leg and then

487
00:46:40.24 --> 00:46:44.96
catapulted me, just threw me up in the air. So when you said it's not a race, you should have been in this like two advanced

488
00:46:44.96 --> 00:46:50.48
of a race for another one. The exact opposite was like a local outlaw race, not an AMA Sanctuary.

489
00:46:51.76 --> 00:46:55.84
It was just a fun race, but there's no fun races because you still got a win.

490
00:46:55.84 --> 00:47:06.08
And I was battling first. And a funny thing was I was racing in the 250 class and the 125 class at that time.

491
00:47:06.08 --> 00:47:09.84
So I had already race those two and then there was this the unlimited class where

492
00:47:10.72 --> 00:47:16.24
it didn't matter, you can race anything you wanted in it. And so I was racing six motos that night,

493
00:47:16.24 --> 00:47:21.84
six different races that afternoon and night. It was the six motos exhausted. And at folks don't

494
00:47:21.84 --> 00:47:27.76
realize man, I'm in phenomenal shape at this time and motorcross is still one of the most

495
00:47:27.76 --> 00:47:32.96
physically demanding things I've ever done. And you know, because you just don't realize that you're

496
00:47:32.96 --> 00:47:40.96
strapped to a 230, 40 pound piece of equipment that has 45 horsepower. You know, with the right.

497
00:47:42.64 --> 00:47:47.60
You know, you're trying to control that thing. It's not like you're just relaxing on it. You're

498
00:47:47.60 --> 00:47:56.32
standing up. You're clenching it. You know, twinuleys all that. And anyway, yeah man. So now my career is like,

499
00:47:56.32 --> 00:48:02.48
okay, now what? So through it advisement, okay, look, you lost all this time. I'm going to sign

500
00:48:02.48 --> 00:48:05.68
you up for the Charlie course, the engineer demo course, and I'm like, all right, at this point,

501
00:48:05.68 --> 00:48:09.92
I just want to get in the course. And you know, I've been basically doing nothing for eight months

502
00:48:09.92 --> 00:48:16.48
that's ever rehab. And so, okay, cool. So did the Charlie course. It was kind of funny man in the

503
00:48:16.48 --> 00:48:23.04
Charlie course because I'm from North Carolina. So I know people at UNCW, which is a, you know,

504
00:48:23.04 --> 00:48:31.44
Wilmington is a college town with a beach problem, right? It's a state ECU party. I have friends

505
00:48:31.44 --> 00:48:35.20
everywhere. So I was like the tour guide on the weekend, right? Like, yeah, I know people at this school.

506
00:48:35.20 --> 00:48:39.28
Let's go to this party, all that kind of stuff. So we're having a good time. That's why I met that fellow

507
00:48:39.28 --> 00:48:47.20
Ben Bettner, our little click, and a bunch of little crazy dudes. And you know, borderline,

508
00:48:47.20 --> 00:48:51.28
you know, we were misbehaving in the QCourse, you know, because it wasn't at hard, you know,

509
00:48:51.28 --> 00:48:56.40
especially in the MLS phase, it wasn't the very hard. So we were party in and blah, blah.

510
00:48:57.44 --> 00:49:01.20
Yeah, I did all that stuff. Language school wasn't hard back then because no one cared about

511
00:49:01.20 --> 00:49:05.60
language. You really didn't have to go to language school. So I went to language school, but did

512
00:49:05.60 --> 00:49:13.20
not learn French. And then of course it didn't really matter because it was like eight years

513
00:49:13.20 --> 00:49:16.88
later before I ever went anywhere that spoke French. You know, not a lot of French speakers and I

514
00:49:16.88 --> 00:49:25.04
rack and Afghanistan, you know. But you have African cool stuff. I got lucky though because if I had

515
00:49:25.04 --> 00:49:29.44
done the medicore, I would have missed the invasion. I'd have been in language school or

516
00:49:29.44 --> 00:49:34.88
Sarah school during that time frame. So because I did the shorter Charlie Cours, I was already done

517
00:49:34.88 --> 00:49:40.32
and I wanted to team and doing some pretty cool stuff. I have to understand kicks off and I got

518
00:49:40.32 --> 00:49:45.60
to go to the beginning. Where were you when September 11th went down? So when I said what doing cool stuff?

519
00:49:46.64 --> 00:49:53.04
I wanted, he was the ASO guy, right? The source operations guy, not the door kicker guy. Even

520
00:49:53.04 --> 00:49:58.88
though he had done all that, he had just matured into understanding that that's the hard part, right?

521
00:49:58.88 --> 00:50:03.20
The finish is the easy part, right? How long does that take us to execute a target? You know,

522
00:50:04.56 --> 00:50:12.80
30 to 90 seconds typically, right? We're on target. Everyone's up tied or done. We're done with the

523
00:50:12.80 --> 00:50:20.96
target. Now we're doing SSC. It's quick. It's that find fixed part, ASO stuff, right? It's actually

524
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:26.08
difficult. It takes a brain. And he was all about that and because I was that skinny college kid,

525
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:34.80
I didn't look like an SF guy. So he got me signed up on this program that 5th group, 10th

526
00:50:34.80 --> 00:50:39.60
group, all the active groups were participating. It was 10th group's year to run it. And it was the

527
00:50:39.60 --> 00:50:46.40
red cell against the end triple C, the new cook commanding control. So for the four months leading up to

528
00:50:46.40 --> 00:50:55.20
9-11, I'm running around the nation, tracking and developing patterns of life of this

529
00:50:55.20 --> 00:51:02.24
general, it's got a suitcase attached to him. He's like number 12 in the chain of command

530
00:51:02.24 --> 00:51:07.28
of running our country in the time of the nuclear war with Russia. And I had no idea because it was

531
00:51:07.28 --> 00:51:14.64
very cellular, right? It was broken down in the little cells, which is ironic, right? Because now

532
00:51:14.64 --> 00:51:21.28
we're playing red against the United States, nuclear commanding control. For those six months,

533
00:51:21.28 --> 00:51:26.64
I didn't interact. I did not see face to face. It was all old school cold war tradecraft.

534
00:51:26.64 --> 00:51:31.84
Dead drives. No, no text messages. Nothing. And the only time I got text messages I was

535
00:51:31.84 --> 00:51:38.88
called is when I actually called the handler who was a chief out of 10th group and he was running

536
00:51:38.88 --> 00:51:46.40
our cell. So we were in Oklahoma, Nebraska, silos, right? And this guy would go from

537
00:51:46.40 --> 00:51:52.24
silo facility to silo facility with these tractor trailers that indiscripped. Three tractor

538
00:51:52.24 --> 00:51:57.12
trailers are so. And that could change, right? And then a security detail.

539
00:51:58.32 --> 00:52:02.24
That all playing clothes and stuff, right? Like you drive it on a highway, you would never notice

540
00:52:02.24 --> 00:52:05.92
this convoy. Of course, they didn't nut the buck convoy either. It was just these three tractor

541
00:52:05.92 --> 00:52:11.04
trailer trucks. And sometimes more than that, sometimes the convoy was much larger when they had

542
00:52:11.04 --> 00:52:14.24
other pieces of equipment that I had no idea what it was. I only cared about him.

543
00:52:14.24 --> 00:52:20.88
Because the ultimate goal was when we were supposed to execute, we were trying to create

544
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:25.36
four second hiccup in the United States. In the United States, in the United States, reaction

545
00:52:25.36 --> 00:52:31.92
the rushes of time. War seconds. That was what it was. That's all supposedly rush and needed.

546
00:52:33.20 --> 00:52:37.68
War seconds, man. Well, come to find out man. It was a worldwide effort. I wouldn't just

547
00:52:37.68 --> 00:52:40.88
my four goofballs. And I knew there was some others because other teammates in my were

548
00:52:40.88 --> 00:52:44.64
scattered around the country. And I knew they were doing it. I had no idea where they're at.

549
00:52:44.64 --> 00:52:48.72
Because last time my song was a meeting in Northern Virginia where we all came together,

550
00:52:48.72 --> 00:52:53.04
they briefed us in a single one of the ways. And it was fun, man. I'm just a little punk-y little

551
00:52:53.04 --> 00:52:58.24
SF dude. Man, there were unlimited budget, freaking, just swiping a government credit card.

552
00:52:58.24 --> 00:53:04.16
There was days I had two different rental cars, freaking, you know, hotel. And it was an amazing

553
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:10.80
thing. It was really cool because you know how to get interim T.S., which backed in a little baby E.6.

554
00:53:10.80 --> 00:53:16.64
I had a T.S. Clansus. So that paved the way to get my my Clansus set up and all that.

555
00:53:17.44 --> 00:53:23.52
Much younger than I should have probably. Or at least was standard at the time.

556
00:53:24.16 --> 00:53:30.88
So yeah man, on the morning of 9.11, I would crawl through this drainage little

557
00:53:30.88 --> 00:53:35.92
culvert. I went to Walmart, bought some leafy Gucci flies from Walmart. And I thought,

558
00:53:35.92 --> 00:53:41.68
if we can get a little crappy Walmart, Gillesuit, and I called for four hours to get within,

559
00:53:41.68 --> 00:53:47.36
taking a picture of this general. That was going to be the shot. And like I said, man, you

560
00:53:47.36 --> 00:53:52.24
got teams around the world, taking pictures of different types of planes and tell numbers. And

561
00:53:52.24 --> 00:53:58.40
oh, this plane took off and into a turkey and then it landed in Alaska, like, they flew across the

562
00:53:58.40 --> 00:54:08.16
North Pole. I mean, these are some crazy assets, right? Well, yeah man, so I get a text and it's

563
00:54:08.16 --> 00:54:16.08
like a board moved to such and such. And I'm like, I'm not compromised. I'm good. Right now,

564
00:54:16.80 --> 00:54:23.20
what's the text I got back? A board right now. And I'm watching his security detail change.

565
00:54:23.20 --> 00:54:34.48
Hmm. What's happening? And as I'm crawling out, man, freaking like the local sheriff's department,

566
00:54:34.48 --> 00:54:39.84
freaking starts pulling in. Do's have got shotguns, right? Local redneck do's,

567
00:54:40.48 --> 00:54:46.000
some Marines showed up. I guess they were like, freaking had been hovering this whole time

568
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.44
as Marine detail that I was not even aware of. I'm likely they weren't aware of me either. So now

569
00:54:51.44 --> 00:54:56.000
I'm crawling quickly because it's clear something is going on, right? Because they've got

570
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.52
mags in their guns. I'm like, what the fuck man? Get out, get my car, freaking call, hey, what's up?

571
00:55:03.52 --> 00:55:08.96
Yeah, meet me at this motel. It's like, you know, side of the road dirt motel, one story old school,

572
00:55:08.96 --> 00:55:15.60
you know, 1950s built motel. And there's like 40 rental cars in this motel parking lot. I'm like,

573
00:55:15.60 --> 00:55:21.36
what? Oh, it's going to come to find out it's not my four man cell. And they were reddubnet

574
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:26.88
sees upon redundancies for all these cells, but every location around the world. And none of us knew

575
00:55:26.88 --> 00:55:30.72
about each other. And I coupled them and you like recognize them. These things have been going on for

576
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:36.96
months. And I'm like, I saw you in Nebraska. I saw you males, females. And this is, that's a good point

577
00:55:36.96 --> 00:55:43.36
because that was the first time in life. I realized how important females are for reconnaissance

578
00:55:43.36 --> 00:55:48.56
surveillance, freaking like they, wow, they do have an amazing role. That changed a lot of my career,

579
00:55:48.56 --> 00:55:56.80
the way I saw women and how they can be an asset, right? Like me and you, right? How do we walk around?

580
00:55:56.80 --> 00:56:03.60
We're not building anywhere. We don't even blend in in average. US freaking, you know, city much less.

581
00:56:03.60 --> 00:56:08.64
Throw on some a man dress and try to walk around to a lot about that. Yeah, we're busted.

582
00:56:08.64 --> 00:56:13.60
Yeah. But man, these ladies, you know, they can go and do, especially when you recruit the ones

583
00:56:13.60 --> 00:56:18.08
that can speak Arabic and, you know, can blend in, right, which we learned that lesson. But this

584
00:56:18.08 --> 00:56:23.12
was my first time seeing females. I was like, holy crap. Come to find out, one of the people on

585
00:56:23.12 --> 00:56:29.92
my team was a female. I didn't know. I'm just dead drop in letters and knows. So anyway, as I walk

586
00:56:29.92 --> 00:56:34.56
into hotel and man, yeah, there's like 40 people in this little hotel. It's not, I mean, just cramped

587
00:56:34.56 --> 00:56:41.92
hands sitting and looking at a TV of burning towers. Yeah, man, I'm just sitting there going,

588
00:56:41.92 --> 00:56:49.28
okay, what the fuck? We're under attack. And at this point, you know, it's early in the morning.

589
00:56:49.28 --> 00:56:56.72
No one even knows. Pentegon hadn't been hit yet. And so that happened while we were sitting there.

590
00:56:56.72 --> 00:57:03.60
I was just like, whoa, okay. So we pack up. We actually went linked up with that asset

591
00:57:04.24 --> 00:57:10.88
and provided a ring of security for them and escorted. So we went from playing red cell against

592
00:57:10.88 --> 00:57:16.16
them to helping with their security cordon. We were unarmed. So we pulled an outer security and

593
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:22.72
escorted them to a hard location. Yeah. And then got on planes and flew back to wherever we were

594
00:57:22.72 --> 00:57:28.40
supposed to. They were unique guys. They were guys from Damneck and bald. Everybody flew back as fast

595
00:57:28.40 --> 00:57:33.36
as they could. But planes were grounded. So they're sending C-17s from wherever they could and

596
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:38.96
picking us up. We drove 100 miles away to Colorado Springs in a 10th group and got on flight

597
00:57:38.96 --> 00:57:43.84
wherever we could get them. It was always funny because, you know, like, the two one guys,

598
00:57:43.84 --> 00:57:47.76
you know, the the lear jets were waiting for them. We're just waiting on like whatever we could get.

599
00:57:47.76 --> 00:57:52.24
Like, oh, can I get on that crop? Do you get a ride back to brag? You know? But it was always

600
00:57:52.24 --> 00:57:56.08
remembered. That was my first impression of those guys. Like, how come they get lear jets?

601
00:57:56.08 --> 00:58:02.80
No, they're they're important. We're the scrubs. But yeah, man. So that's how it all got started.

602
00:58:02.80 --> 00:58:11.04
You know, I had a slot to go to MFF and, you know, National Guard, young SF2 to get a slot in

603
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:15.28
free fall was a big deal back then. You know, because back then we didn't all SF2 and all go to

604
00:58:15.28 --> 00:58:21.28
free fall. And so that chief was like, well, I mean, your orders are good for another year.

605
00:58:21.28 --> 00:58:27.84
Your detailed and assigned to us. And what do you want to do? That's what I mean. Well, you can

606
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:34.16
go to free fall or you can come with us in life. I'm with you. Let's go. A couple of weeks like

607
00:58:34.16 --> 00:58:40.32
your man. We're in Afghanistan. You know, young, dumb kid. What that look like? So they're like,

608
00:58:40.32 --> 00:58:46.48
what kind of what they do say? All right, here's what we're doing. Yeah, a lot of people

609
00:58:46.48 --> 00:58:51.28
figured out. Like, you had used to say to you, yeah, I mean, it was like, hey, you know, call

610
00:58:51.28 --> 00:58:58.000
your family members. We're going to an isolation Monday. We're doing what? What's that? What's

611
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.76
isolation? Like, this is how, like, I only, I was fleshed out into about what that Robin says.

612
00:59:01.76 --> 00:59:06.64
I didn't completely understand, right? And honestly, most of the guys didn't either. It was like,

613
00:59:06.64 --> 00:59:11.60
no, just because I was new, none of the force had been to war either. There was still only a handful

614
00:59:11.60 --> 00:59:15.92
of guys in SF because only a handful of fifth group dudes got to play in the Gulf War.

615
00:59:15.92 --> 00:59:22.000
Yeah, handful of guys from Mogadishu, you know, no combat experience. Yeah, I was going to say,

616
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.72
in your actual team, there might have been zero. The chief had stuff in South American 80s,

617
00:59:29.60 --> 00:59:35.60
you know, but all, you know, by with and through advisement stuff. But yeah, man, so I'm like,

618
00:59:35.60 --> 00:59:43.52
okay, well, here we go. And I'm in, I got to go and be in Torbora, you know, so there was basically

619
00:59:43.52 --> 00:59:47.52
a lot of, because it's funny for us, like we all know how it all played out. But I mean,

620
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:53.20
there's an entire generation of Americans that were born either right at or after 911,

621
00:59:53.20 --> 00:59:57.20
who don't understand, right? There was two parts of Afghanistan that was the Taliban,

622
00:59:57.84 --> 01:00:01.76
right? The horse soldiers and everybody that came down from the north and

623
01:00:01.76 --> 01:00:06.24
background, you know, triple nickel, you know, all that team did all that. And then there was Torbora,

624
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:14.48
pardon me. And, you know, okay, so I got lucky enough to be involved in all of that. My team settled

625
01:00:14.48 --> 01:00:20.48
in Jalalabad. Where'd you find, where, how'd you get in there? Yeah, he though. Yeah. So he

626
01:00:20.48 --> 01:00:25.36
loaded into Jalalabad and you guys get, um, we, he loaded in South of Jalalabad, North of Torbora.

627
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:30.40
And then what was your, what'd you do? Um, I'll just support it. Mostly supported the J tax and

628
01:00:30.40 --> 01:00:37.84
CCTV guys dropping bombs. All right. And tried to mostly coordinate and keep our, you know,

629
01:00:37.84 --> 01:00:42.64
there was two main warlords in this region. And one was Hazard Ali. And the other was Saman.

630
01:00:43.44 --> 01:00:50.000
And Zaman spoke English. And then was the agency's pick to be that Nengahar warlord,

631
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.92
that Nengahar leader. Was the man had lived in Britain for 10 or 12 years. He left Afghanistan.

632
01:00:57.92 --> 01:01:04.88
Hazard Ali was moves, man. He was, he was a farmer. Right. You know, a lot of folks

633
01:01:04.88 --> 01:01:10.96
don't realize, man. You know, Afghanistan of the 14 most opium producing countries in the world.

634
01:01:10.96 --> 01:01:18.000
Afghanistan was number 14 when we invaded. It's number one right now. That's a horrible result of

635
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.32
this war. Well, Hazard Ali, who ultimately became the minister of defense, afghanistan, was a farmer.

636
01:01:24.32 --> 01:01:30.72
But also, a freedom fighter moves against the Taliban. The Taliban very much disallowed,

637
01:01:30.72 --> 01:01:36.24
opium growth. You know, they, they were all about, you know, that was a sin. So,

638
01:01:37.36 --> 01:01:39.60
you know, we changed that. I get into the Taliban.

639
01:01:40.64 --> 01:01:45.76
All right. Everybody started going opium. You know, and wow, what beautiful fields, those pink

640
01:01:45.76 --> 01:01:50.24
red flowers, man. They're beautiful. But, ooh, it's just death growing out of the ground.

641
01:01:50.24 --> 01:01:57.68
You know, so anyway, yeah, man. How long are you on the ground for? How much longer? This is where

642
01:01:57.68 --> 01:02:02.24
my first. This is that question is where my fairy tell of initial entry and

643
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:10.72
special horses begins to end. So, fifth group wanted out as fast as they could. So,

644
01:02:10.72 --> 01:02:13.92
January, February, they're already like, yeah, we're going to the horn. When do you get their

645
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:19.36
November? So, November, December, January and fifth group is already, the fifth group is like,

646
01:02:19.36 --> 01:02:24.000
they want out. They want to get to the horn of Africa, right? There's still no talk of Iraq at this point.

647
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.32
Right? It's like, oh, horn of Africa. We're going to Somali and everybody wanted that.

648
01:02:28.32 --> 01:02:33.36
Oh, okay. We're going to get some and return that favor. Right? It's 10-year-old favor. We owe those

649
01:02:33.36 --> 01:02:38.000
Somali's. Everybody wanted to get there. Well, then the clear-of-battle plans changed and

650
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.40
Iraq became a thing. Well, so 19th group and third group start showing up. So they're like,

651
01:02:44.40 --> 01:02:48.64
hey, look, we're just going to, you're going to be continuity. You're going to help this next team

652
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:57.60
rip in. Right? So, I got left. I wanted to stay like another six months. And I was like, oh, no.

653
01:02:57.60 --> 01:03:02.32
So, that was where that ferry to. Everything happened. It really cool. Kind of went, oh shit.

654
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:07.92
But it wasn't bad because I wound up being on a team with a bunch of dudes that were good friends.

655
01:03:07.92 --> 01:03:15.20
Mine actually got to go be an LNO for a few weeks up in Tashkint, Uzbekistan. So, as a, you know,

656
01:03:15.20 --> 01:03:22.96
24, 25-year-old young little buck. My first experience in a former Soviet area. It was nice,

657
01:03:22.96 --> 01:03:27.04
nice four weeks apart. I was supposed to work at the embassy. I think I went to the embassy twice.

658
01:03:27.68 --> 01:03:34.64
I was the assistant LNO. The LNO was this former tech group dude who had retired, got called back in.

659
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:42.16
And he had been working like the Miami-Dade organized crime task force. He was a, he,

660
01:03:42.16 --> 01:03:48.16
I'm not a says that. He had a very Ukrainian name. He was from the Ukrainian. He came to America when

661
01:03:48.16 --> 01:03:53.60
he was like 12. So, he spoke Russian, Ukrainian. Man, he had all kinds of stuff going on in Ukraine.

662
01:03:53.60 --> 01:03:59.44
Or not Ukrainian. Uzbekistan. And he was connected as the LNO out there. If you needed something

663
01:03:59.44 --> 01:04:04.88
out of Uzbekistan, he could get it. I mean, the second night I was up there, the dude took me to a party

664
01:04:04.88 --> 01:04:12.48
at the Ukrainian Uzbekistan. He's president's daughter's house, no, man. And this dude knew

665
01:04:12.48 --> 01:04:19.44
everybody. He was the quintessential SF guy. But he's like almost 60. He's kind of a way. He speaks

666
01:04:19.44 --> 01:04:27.04
Russian and he's fluent. So, like four days after I get up there, he's like, oh, yeah, I'm going to the

667
01:04:27.04 --> 01:04:33.52
states. So now I'm just up there, the assistant LNO. And I'm living in the Sheraton, which that's

668
01:04:33.52 --> 01:04:40.96
rushing for Sheraton Hotel. So, all I learned. And so, I just pored it for like four weeks.

669
01:04:40.96 --> 01:04:46.32
And, you know, basically my job was to take, you know, my bud, my Uzbekistan, my brother, my Uzbekistan,

670
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:50.64
and go pick up people from the airport, take them to the hotel and then take them back to the airport.

671
01:04:50.64 --> 01:04:59.36
So, they could fly into the FOB. And, so, yeah, man, pretty cool. But, yeah, so back to Afghanistan,

672
01:04:59.36 --> 01:05:04.08
and then finally home. And, you know, did you do any good ops? Like, what kind of missions were you doing?

673
01:05:04.08 --> 01:05:09.52
Yeah, you did a lot of cool stuff. You know, of course, you know, dropping all the bombs in Torboro's

674
01:05:09.52 --> 01:05:15.20
school. Of course, we started. And there was still a lot of, you know, stuff out there, you know,

675
01:05:15.20 --> 01:05:22.24
we went after some, um, diagonal and chetions, you know, some of those, as they were, you know,

676
01:05:22.24 --> 01:05:27.28
because, you know, when you guys already working with a partner force, yeah, we started the

677
01:05:27.28 --> 01:05:33.04
initial, what became the command dose. It was called the MRF, the Merff Mobile Reaction Force,

678
01:05:33.04 --> 01:05:37.44
there in Jalalabon. Jalabon wasn't a base. It was just a crappy airfield. Every time we went

679
01:05:37.44 --> 01:05:41.84
and get a resupply, we had to clear the airfield. And, uh, clear the runway, make sure that

680
01:05:41.84 --> 01:05:47.36
and putting you thing on, you know, the MC130s would, you know, squeak in in the middle of the night,

681
01:05:47.36 --> 01:05:53.52
drop our junk off. And, um, so we started building what became Jalalabon's FOB. We built

682
01:05:53.52 --> 01:05:59.04
ranges out there and started training this, uh, Hossard Ali's guys. And, you know, I was

683
01:05:59.04 --> 01:06:05.36
sorry about Zaman and Hossard Ali. They, they're the reason freaking, uh, you be all got away.

684
01:06:06.64 --> 01:06:12.32
They were supposed to be helping us deal with Al Qaeda and they turned on each other, right? So

685
01:06:12.32 --> 01:06:17.04
Zaman, the CIA's pick, no one liked him. He had no real pull. He was nobody. He had most of these

686
01:06:17.04 --> 01:06:21.92
kids had never heard of him. And Ali, who's been there, you know, running a show,

687
01:06:21.92 --> 01:06:27.44
he's not having it. So, yeah, man, they started fighting with each other and you got, like,

688
01:06:27.44 --> 01:06:31.04
you know, half the teams over there with them and some of the other teams and then half of us

689
01:06:31.04 --> 01:06:36.16
over here with Zaman or, uh, Hossard Ali's guys and they're fighting each other. And we're like,

690
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:40.40
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're supposed to be killing those dudes. So, it screwed the war up

691
01:06:40.40 --> 01:06:46.24
for about three days as we sorted that mess out. And, yeah, man, that's when that's when he escaped.

692
01:06:46.24 --> 01:06:50.80
That's when he got out. How do you guys sort that out? Ultimately, the agency stepped in,

693
01:06:50.80 --> 01:06:55.36
they were running the show there, right? The Julietteens. And we were basically supporting them.

694
01:06:56.40 --> 01:07:02.64
And we had two masters, right? We had the FOB in fifth groups, Colonel Mulholen. And then, of course,

695
01:07:02.64 --> 01:07:11.20
we had the ground branch guys. And they were running the show in Torbore. And so, we, uh,

696
01:07:12.88 --> 01:07:18.72
freaking sorted that mess out. And basically, they told Zaman, like, a stand-out. And once everything was

697
01:07:18.72 --> 01:07:26.80
hashed out, settled back, by went to Jawabod. Zaman actually went back to the to Britain. They

698
01:07:26.80 --> 01:07:30.72
exiled him. That's what Hossard Ali told everybody that he exiled him. But really, they just

699
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:34.40
was like, hey, man, you just need to lead your own. So it was a bad call. And it was, you know,

700
01:07:34.40 --> 01:07:39.60
uh, one of those convenient things he spoke English, Hossard Ali did. And,

701
01:07:40.56 --> 01:07:44.64
bad call, when our part on who we decided, we thought we could put in power.

702
01:07:44.64 --> 01:07:50.48
Um, we didn't really understand how much influence Hossard Ali really had over the post to people.

703
01:07:50.48 --> 01:07:55.28
Well, at least they had the humility to recognize that and say, all right, cool. We screwed this up.

704
01:07:55.28 --> 01:07:58.32
Let's get this guy out of here and move forward. You know, it's interesting to

705
01:08:00.08 --> 01:08:03.44
history repeats itself, right? Like talking about the SF guys and Vietnam.

706
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:11.20
I even have those, like guys shoot each other on base between the, the, the, the, the mongs and, uh,

707
01:08:11.20 --> 01:08:15.44
whatever other groups like the regular view. I mean, they'd get in fights, right? And shoot each other.

708
01:08:15.44 --> 01:08:19.92
Yeah. Yeah. Like, well, and then they go out and mission with these guys. That's one of our

709
01:08:19.92 --> 01:08:24.24
biggest problems, right? We for some reason as Americans, we have this arrogance that we think everyone's

710
01:08:24.24 --> 01:08:31.52
like us and likes the things we like. And, well, you know, we have this amazing experiment in America,

711
01:08:31.52 --> 01:08:39.04
this diversity that's never been this way. And he wear else on the planet ever. So we can walk out on the

712
01:08:39.04 --> 01:08:46.32
street, go to McDonald's and see 20 different ethnicities, freaking people from all around the world.

713
01:08:46.88 --> 01:08:50.48
Right? At least their ancestors are. And in some cases, they literally just came from that.

714
01:08:50.48 --> 01:08:55.44
Mm-hmm. Well, in other countries, those people will fight each other, right? They're like

715
01:08:55.44 --> 01:08:59.68
from different villages and different tribes. And they don't like each other and never going to.

716
01:08:59.68 --> 01:09:06.24
We think we can impose that. Right? Like, Americans can't grasp why the shit and the Sunni

717
01:09:06.24 --> 01:09:11.12
absolutely hate each other and we'll fight each other. And the only time they'll come together

718
01:09:11.12 --> 01:09:18.64
is to fight someone else to hate more. Us or Israel. Right? Yeah, you know, Americans,

719
01:09:18.64 --> 01:09:25.44
and we're bad about it. You know, we really think we can imply or impose our way of doing things.

720
01:09:26.24 --> 01:09:31.20
And you know, the deal, man, you know, you got your kind of or whoever else at the F.O.B.

721
01:09:31.20 --> 01:09:35.20
We're out there living with these boys. You know, living with them. There are our team.

722
01:09:35.20 --> 01:09:39.76
And we're trying to explain all the dynamics of it. And you got some可能 who's never done

723
01:09:39.76 --> 01:09:44.000
even like Fidz or J.S. at much less run an unconventional war with a partner force.

724
01:09:44.56 --> 01:09:47.68
I was frustrating, you know? Because it to me is just simple.

725
01:09:48.24 --> 01:09:52.72
You know, it's like, hey, just be nice to all these people. Sure you can stop treating them like crap

726
01:09:52.72 --> 01:09:59.20
and realize that that tribe and that tribe should not ever be put in the same unit and given

727
01:09:59.20 --> 01:10:05.76
loaded weapons, they will shoot each other. But, man, it's us, you know, it's just how we do

728
01:10:05.76 --> 01:10:10.80
things and like you said it. We just repeat it time and time again. Yeah, sometimes I think it's

729
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.04
it's conceit or whatever arrogance that we think. Well, if we tell you guys to work together,

730
01:10:17.04 --> 01:10:20.96
we're going to work together. And sometimes I think it's just arrogance. It just don't realize like,

731
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:25.12
hey, at least these two people that you're talking to right now, they're not going to get along

732
01:10:25.12 --> 01:10:31.20
ever, ever, ever. Nothing you can do. Yeah. Unless for some reason, like, ever,

733
01:10:31.20 --> 01:10:35.76
you say, ever as well. That's what the hell goes against that. But it's so good.

734
01:10:35.76 --> 01:10:39.76
The person's gone. You can be an ally for the next two days. How much money are you going to

735
01:10:39.76 --> 01:10:44.08
get out of this? You know, if it like, and you know, that's funny. I've always tried to tell folks,

736
01:10:44.08 --> 01:10:49.44
there's a huge difference between allies and friends. An allies are usually pretty predictable.

737
01:10:49.44 --> 01:10:56.16
Because that means we have a very common goal, a common enemy, a common, we have a common

738
01:10:56.16 --> 01:11:01.12
ality. Whereas friends, a lot of times friends, that's a loose relationship based mostly on emotion.

739
01:11:02.08 --> 01:11:07.36
Right? And you, you see it all the time. Who hurts our feelings the most? Our friends.

740
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.76
Our allies are predictable. When you go into an alliance, so like business advice, I've always given

741
01:11:13.76 --> 01:11:17.60
guys business advice when a lesson is out of the list, don't start a business with a friend.

742
01:11:17.60 --> 01:11:22.80
If you have to have a partner and you shouldn't take a partner. But if you have to have a partner,

743
01:11:22.80 --> 01:11:27.52
get this endeavor started. Do not do it with a friend. I haven't listened to that advice. Like,

744
01:11:27.52 --> 01:11:32.88
all my businesses are with all my friends. I hope you had better luck than I have.

745
01:11:32.88 --> 01:11:38.56
That's a good, man. It's hard. You know, when you got, especially we tend to start businesses

746
01:11:38.56 --> 01:11:44.40
with guys like us. And we're also hard headed and setting our ways and all that, you know, and if

747
01:11:44.40 --> 01:11:49.28
there's not some type of clear hierarchy in those operations agreements and that stuff that

748
01:11:49.28 --> 01:11:53.60
you can always go back to and be like, hey buddy, this is what the company says.

749
01:11:54.32 --> 01:11:58.48
Well, in my case, we didn't even have like an operations agreement. We just started it and then,

750
01:11:58.48 --> 01:12:03.76
you know, luckily it didn't dissolve into where we hated each other and it's like that. But,

751
01:12:04.80 --> 01:12:07.76
my dad always told me that he was like, you know, you know, a partner don't have one.

752
01:12:07.76 --> 01:12:16.000
Yeah. And then sure enough, he was right. He was smart. Yeah, man. The crew was awesome.

753
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.80
So how, so you end up going to, so you end up spending this first like, what is it?

754
01:12:20.80 --> 01:12:24.08
A year and a nine months and a half, and a little bit of time, and he's back.

755
01:12:24.08 --> 01:12:32.80
7.5 months and then what happens? So we're home and you're in the national guard. Are you

756
01:12:32.80 --> 01:12:36.72
so you're in the national guard? Yeah, but I'm on active duty. Okay. So it's no different.

757
01:12:36.72 --> 01:12:42.16
No, so, you know, the guard guys would mow and demobes and there would be two months on the,

758
01:12:42.16 --> 01:12:45.92
you know, they let's say they deployed for eight months. And that was pretty typical.

759
01:12:45.92 --> 01:12:51.36
It was two months of mob and in two months of demobes for a total of a year,

760
01:12:52.40 --> 01:12:57.36
deployment. Got it. And so it was the deployment two months on the front end, two months on the back end.

761
01:12:57.36 --> 01:13:03.60
That became the standard for SF, national guard. Well, mine was kind of like, well, what do I do now?

762
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:10.32
Who do I belong to when I'm working for? And so I was lucky. I freaking,

763
01:13:11.36 --> 01:13:17.60
did some, the counter drug mission for the national guard. It's advisement to law enforcement.

764
01:13:18.16 --> 01:13:25.20
So I did that until, right? Yeah. And it's providing surveillance training,

765
01:13:26.40 --> 01:13:30.64
you know, deal with it. It's kind of, what about possible?

766
01:13:30.64 --> 01:13:35.20
Sculpt well, you know, we're unarmed. Most of the time, you know, sometimes you know,

767
01:13:35.20 --> 01:13:39.20
we're really going to go out in the middle of West Virginia and reveal these methods with 30

768
01:13:39.20 --> 01:13:44.08
out six rifles. Probably going to carry my personal firearm and deal with the ramifications later.

769
01:13:45.52 --> 01:13:49.52
And I had a couple times where methods like, we were snow,

770
01:13:50.48 --> 01:13:54.64
we actually didn't think he was home. He must have been sleeping it off, you know, because

771
01:13:54.64 --> 01:13:58.80
methods would, you know, they'd be up for days and then they'll sleep for days. And we thought this

772
01:13:58.80 --> 01:14:03.28
math trailer, there was no, you know, they weren't cooking or whatever. And our sitting on the

773
01:14:03.28 --> 01:14:08.16
size mountain that snow, we're wearing woodland camouflage, we're eating, we're messing about,

774
01:14:08.16 --> 01:14:14.64
we didn't build a high-side, some come up. We're not taking this seriously. And we're like 250

775
01:14:14.64 --> 01:14:20.000
meters from this dude's, it's like a cabin and a trailer, open his holler in West Virginia.

776
01:14:21.12 --> 01:14:28.08
Dude, he comes out and starts scanning with his hunt right for an scope. Dang. And we're just sitting

777
01:14:28.08 --> 01:14:33.44
there trying to get behind your trees. We're sticking out like sore thums and we're not wearing

778
01:14:33.44 --> 01:14:38.64
overwides or anything, just dumb. Because like I said, we weren't taking it seriously. You know,

779
01:14:38.64 --> 01:14:43.04
we just been to Afghanistan. We're a bunch of tough guys. What's this dumb red neck? We're looking

780
01:14:43.04 --> 01:14:47.60
at Redneck didn't see us in shoot us, right? Cause let's face it, Redneck boys, you know, they

781
01:14:47.60 --> 01:14:51.84
can shoot. Wouldn't have been the first time he shot something without hunting rifle. You know,

782
01:14:51.84 --> 01:14:58.08
I was like, oh, good God. I was running a recon course one time. This is like before the war. And I had

783
01:14:58.08 --> 01:15:05.28
this group up in the mountains. And they're they're like laid up in a high-side, right? And I'm

784
01:15:05.84 --> 01:15:10.88
a land-grade, right? So I'm out there, but I'm camied up to cause I'm all fired up. So I would like

785
01:15:10.88 --> 01:15:16.08
sneak around and so I'm kind of sneaking up on them to kind of observe what they're doing to make

786
01:15:16.08 --> 01:15:22.08
sure that they're being square away. And as I'm sitting there observing them and I'm not that far away from

787
01:15:22.08 --> 01:15:27.92
them, like 50 meters away, a guy, I hear like a dog, right? And I'm like, oh, these catcher can

788
01:15:27.92 --> 01:15:32.24
get, you know, bus, dude, this is going to be cool. I'm going to watch the whole thing. So a guy

789
01:15:32.24 --> 01:15:37.52
comes out, he's got two-fork and German shepherds with them. And they look badass. They look like

790
01:15:37.52 --> 01:15:42.72
freaking wolves. And so the guys, you know, I'm watching this whole thing play out. And you know,

791
01:15:42.72 --> 01:15:46.56
the guys pick up that they're coming because they, it was a square-dwayered little crew. They,

792
01:15:46.56 --> 01:15:49.52
they pick up a guy coming, they go like fade in. They're, they're hunkered down.

793
01:15:50.16 --> 01:15:53.20
Guy comes walking down this path. It wasn't even a road. It was a path.

794
01:15:54.16 --> 01:15:59.92
And he doesn't, he's none the wiser. And all of the sun, the dogs, bro, the dogs are like,

795
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:05.20
they stop, they start growling. And all of the sun, the guy like starts scanning.

796
01:16:05.20 --> 01:16:14.80
Yeah. He reaches down and pulls out a 45 bro. And I'm like 50 meters away. And I go,

797
01:16:14.80 --> 01:16:20.56
excuse me, so the guys, I just go, excuse me, sir, you know, because I'm, we're in America. Like,

798
01:16:20.56 --> 01:16:24.88
you said, I just know what the hell's going on, man. I'm like, excuse me, sir, sir, you know,

799
01:16:24.88 --> 01:16:29.04
sir, it's okay. I said, we're in the military. We're on training operation, but

800
01:16:29.04 --> 01:16:34.88
it was not a good scenario to have. Yeah, there was lots of things like that. You know, especially

801
01:16:34.88 --> 01:16:42.08
in the urban side, good friend of mine, they called him the SF Cowboy. They used his likeness in

802
01:16:42.08 --> 01:16:45.12
that video game and all that. I don't know if you remember some of the first pictures that came

803
01:16:45.12 --> 01:16:52.72
out of Afghanistan, big dude, sleeves cut off, people here. He was my roommate. We're sitting in a

804
01:16:52.72 --> 01:16:58.40
little mini van watching his house and freaking, I'm like, oh crap, I think it's like two in the

805
01:16:58.40 --> 01:17:06.48
morning, you know, and freaking dude walks up. Oh shit, revolver pointing at us. I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

806
01:17:07.04 --> 01:17:11.44
freaking rolls it down. Most of the time we had a law enforcement that guy with us, but in this case,

807
01:17:11.44 --> 01:17:16.88
it was him and I and the law enforcement dudes were in another car up the road. And now it's like,

808
01:17:16.88 --> 01:17:22.48
hey bro, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, well, he's just a concerned citizen, you know, and we're lucky,

809
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:27.76
you know, that could have gone so bad. Can you imagine the headline? All right, like, say one of

810
01:17:27.76 --> 01:17:33.84
us made a mistake and put him on the dirt. You know, an American civilian? Yeah, and, you know,

811
01:17:33.84 --> 01:17:38.000
so since then, I've done a couple of things where I'm at advising law enforcement in the states,

812
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.08
meaningapolis, right? A couple of you before last, right? When that home must kicked off.

813
01:17:45.20 --> 01:17:52.40
And it's like, hey, man, I don't care if you're far left. I don't care if you're BLM and

814
01:17:52.40 --> 01:17:58.24
riding, right? You're the American. I'm not squeezing the trigger on American, right? You can't.

815
01:17:58.24 --> 01:18:03.28
Wrong answer. Now, if you're threatening me, that's different. But just, hey, man, if you're

816
01:18:03.28 --> 01:18:08.08
robbing and looting a best buy, hmm, to me, that's not something I can pull the trigger on somebody

817
01:18:08.08 --> 01:18:14.24
for, man. This is not in my, in my book. And it's weird, you know, it's weird, like you have to remind

818
01:18:14.24 --> 01:18:20.40
guys, like, hey, guys, this is not an operation. We are here in advisement. Only only if you have

819
01:18:20.40 --> 01:18:27.44
done everything you can to get out of that situation. And it's defensive yourself with third party,

820
01:18:27.44 --> 01:18:33.44
man, right? Like, because of backlash, or something like that would be huge. There was those,

821
01:18:33.44 --> 01:18:39.20
it was that old, the border surveillance thing. Oh, yeah, you didn't shot that guy, like, like,

822
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:44.24
like, 90s. I don't know if I forgot the name of the, it was, it had an operation of names. It was like,

823
01:18:44.24 --> 01:18:48.24
right? Yeah, they'd sent all kinds of guys down there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Marines shot that one,

824
01:18:48.24 --> 01:18:53.76
fella. And I was a big deal, and they shot that program down. And we were kind of like a part of

825
01:18:53.76 --> 01:19:00.72
that same umbrella. But yeah, we all just, you know, joking, it's not really that funny. Now that I'm

826
01:19:00.72 --> 01:19:05.84
older that, you know, yeah, post-Positcomutatus, you know, now I look back and I'm like, should

827
01:19:07.12 --> 01:19:12.56
the military and the agency be allowed to advise, because it's face it, right? Like,

828
01:19:12.56 --> 01:19:21.68
in Waco, there were two one advisors on the ground. You know, that's stuff. That's kind of scary,

829
01:19:21.68 --> 01:19:27.52
man, you know, because, you know, the rule of law says that our intelligence organizations,

830
01:19:27.52 --> 01:19:31.28
and our military can't operate here. Of course, the National Guard gets around it a little bit

831
01:19:31.28 --> 01:19:37.36
with that statement. Yeah. But it's scary, right? There's a reason Post-A-Comus exists. So that military

832
01:19:37.36 --> 01:19:42.48
can't turn its weapons towards our population. So looking back, like, I might, man, we are

833
01:19:42.48 --> 01:19:48.08
kids. We are joking, like, man, Post-A-Comutatus. Now I'm like, whoa, it's not funny anymore.

834
01:19:48.08 --> 01:19:52.000
Right? Like, you know, when you're, when you're young and dumb, you make jokes that are inappropriate,

835
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.32
because you're young and dumb. And now I look back, I'm like, I don't know that we should be doing that.

836
01:19:56.32 --> 01:20:01.52
Right? Like, I know law enforcement needs help. But yeah, there's always shouldn't be getting it from us.

837
01:20:01.52 --> 01:20:06.72
There's definitely, I don't know, there's a positive and negative to it too, because obviously,

838
01:20:06.72 --> 01:20:11.28
if you have guys that can help law enforcement improve their, what they do,

839
01:20:11.28 --> 01:20:17.36
like, that's beneficial. And then there's two, two sides of that point too, because

840
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:22.24
guys that are in the military have a certain mindset. Part of that mindset is, hey, man, we've

841
01:20:22.24 --> 01:20:25.36
been through this before. Somebody gets starts getting crazy. We're not worried about it. We're not

842
01:20:25.36 --> 01:20:30.56
freaking out. Like, we'll de-escalate in many cases de-escalate better than someone that hasn't

843
01:20:30.56 --> 01:20:35.68
been in these shitty situations before. But then not all military is created equal. So you might

844
01:20:35.68 --> 01:20:40.80
get someone from the same unit that goes, if somebody does that shit, you gotta freaking go.

845
01:20:40.80 --> 01:20:46.16
And you're like, no, actually, that's not the right answer. So there can be a positive,

846
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:52.16
there can be a negative that both those situations, you could have somebody from the military

847
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:56.56
perform awesome. You could also have someone from the military do something stupid. I mean,

848
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:02.56
just because you're in the military doesn't mean you're, it doesn't mean you're, it all over

849
01:21:02.56 --> 01:21:07.52
the map. You know, all over the map. Some guys tactically, they were in the military for 20 years.

850
01:21:07.52 --> 01:21:12.16
They're tactical idiots. You know, I've gotten out a couple of times with the whole campaign,

851
01:21:12.16 --> 01:21:15.92
like, well, just because you're a veteran doesn't mean you're, and I'm like, you're absolutely

852
01:21:15.92 --> 01:21:22.80
right. Being a veteran doesn't mean that I was even good at being a military. Right? Like, just because

853
01:21:22.80 --> 01:21:27.20
you were in the service doesn't mean you're even good at whatever your God was in the service.

854
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:32.24
So it definitely doesn't automatically qualify you to be a politician. In a lot of ways,

855
01:21:32.24 --> 01:21:40.32
I feel like my experience is completely make me unqualified to be a typical politician.

856
01:21:40.32 --> 01:21:44.88
Right? Like, I'm just, well, I'm kind of getting out here. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not a politician and

857
01:21:44.88 --> 01:21:51.36
never have been, and that's what our country needs right now. And my experience is in the military

858
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:58.88
have set me up to where I could go do good things for our country and never become a politician.

859
01:21:58.88 --> 01:22:03.52
I don't have that in my blood. It's just not how I am. Yeah. As I look at everything that's going

860
01:22:03.52 --> 01:22:08.32
on the last six months after the downfall of Afghanistan, and then even looking at Afghanistan,

861
01:22:08.32 --> 01:22:14.80
Iraq, and then use compare all that to Vietnam. And you say yourself, like those lessons,

862
01:22:14.80 --> 01:22:19.52
every lesson that you can look back at Afghanistan and say, wow, you know, we learn this. We

863
01:22:19.52 --> 01:22:26.08
already knew this. We already knew this stuff from Vietnam. And so when it comes to people being

864
01:22:26.08 --> 01:22:31.76
in the government that are figuring out where we're going to war, I used to think, yeah, you know,

865
01:22:31.76 --> 01:22:36.72
somebody should, somebody should be in the military if they're going to serve in the government.

866
01:22:36.72 --> 01:22:40.000
You know, if they're going to be a politician, they should have, they should have served in the military.

867
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.24
It'd be be helpful, right? I used to think that like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. Like, oh, yeah,

868
01:22:44.24 --> 01:22:47.92
okay, yeah, that makes sense. You understand what continues to serve. Yeah, continue to serve.

869
01:22:47.92 --> 01:22:54.56
It's like, oh, yeah, you know what it's like, but now I'm, we absolutely need military people

870
01:22:54.56 --> 01:23:00.72
that are, that understand these lessons to the core that aren't just thinking with the arrogance that

871
01:23:01.60 --> 01:23:06.64
the generation that just sent us to war. I got it. Let's fight with fight for American principles.

872
01:23:06.64 --> 01:23:13.20
And but, or even worse, who's going to fight? You say we, who's the we? No, no, no, not we. Yeah,

873
01:23:13.20 --> 01:23:19.04
all right. Yeah, those military, those military guys. Anyway, in it, in it, funny, right? You'll

874
01:23:19.04 --> 01:23:28.56
hear about folks who had these awesome, blessed lives. Maybe like, Tillman and a fell football player.

875
01:23:28.56 --> 01:23:32.96
You hear these crazy stories about these people who had these awesome jobs or maybe they

876
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:38.40
came from this awesome family and they go and he and listed it. Like, it's all to make

877
01:23:38.40 --> 01:23:43.44
this soon because he came from an amazing family that he should have been an officer, right?

878
01:23:43.44 --> 01:23:51.92
Like, that prejudice is weird. So the fact that a rich, well-to-do guy in lists and goes to fight

879
01:23:51.92 --> 01:23:58.24
for war, that's a story. Why is that a story? That shouldn't be a story, but it is, right? And I just

880
01:23:58.24 --> 01:24:03.84
use Tillman because he's such a famous story and what what an amazing man, you know, for he can

881
01:24:03.84 --> 01:24:09.20
pro football player, you know, with life is set for this guy, quits that and listen to

882
01:24:09.20 --> 01:24:14.40
Ranger Regiment, right? Like, whoa, bro, you really ask him for it. Like, that's an American stuff.

883
01:24:14.40 --> 01:24:19.12
But my point is, who's going to war? Typically, it's just those young,

884
01:24:20.64 --> 01:24:24.80
what else did you have to do with your life type of guys, you know? And in the guys, like, a lot of

885
01:24:24.80 --> 01:24:28.32
us, right? Let's face it, you know, a lot of upper middle class dudes and soft, you know, and

886
01:24:29.04 --> 01:24:34.000
you know, but and until that calling that I need to do this stuff because they're dad

887
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:45.76
that's a mozzarella and they're good. But, yeah, man, Congress, right, is the only part of our government,

888
01:24:45.76 --> 01:24:53.20
per the Constitution that came to clear war? How is it? We've been at war for 20 years.

889
01:24:55.04 --> 01:25:01.60
What's the point? What was the point, right? Because in, in Delilah Bond, which has been considered

890
01:25:01.60 --> 01:25:10.000
for 10, 12 years now, hot spot, right? But in January, February, March of 2002, I was walking around

891
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:17.44
the market without a gun. I'd hop on the ATV and jump in the truck, hop in the car with one of my

892
01:25:17.44 --> 01:25:25.12
troopers, one of my, F-gannies, run down, wearing an F-gannie guard, the biggest threat to me in that

893
01:25:25.12 --> 01:25:32.32
market or anywhere in Delilah about our all of Nango Harp Province was having the people hugged me

894
01:25:32.32 --> 01:25:37.84
too tightly. That was the biggest threat to me. Or maybe a car accident, a coach traffic's crazy.

895
01:25:37.84 --> 01:25:44.48
You know, they love this, they love this. So what happened? The conventional military showed up.

896
01:25:44.48 --> 01:25:49.12
So all the carinals and generals can get their stars and their awards and get their promotions.

897
01:25:49.12 --> 01:25:57.04
Those politicians, because it's facing it, right? Once you become a certain level,

898
01:25:57.60 --> 01:26:01.92
whether it's enlisted or officer, right, your career becomes that thing and then looking out for

899
01:26:01.92 --> 01:26:08.24
your other upper senior officer, senior enlisted, we've got to get them bronze stars, we've got

900
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:14.96
in part-purple hearts, our unit needs metals, our unit needs combat, because to become a general

901
01:26:14.96 --> 01:26:20.56
without a C-I-B in the army. In this timeframe, you've got to go get some, right?

902
01:26:20.56 --> 01:26:23.36
And you're going to probably need a silver star, at least a bronze star would be.

903
01:26:24.08 --> 01:26:27.68
So how am I going to do that? Unless I go to war. So let's take these strikers and these

904
01:26:27.68 --> 01:26:33.28
M2 Bradley's and destroy roads and run over innocent people. And they weren't doing it on purpose.

905
01:26:33.28 --> 01:26:39.28
They're just, that's the conventional military. They have tanks. And you know, I've never driven

906
01:26:39.28 --> 01:26:43.92
a striker before, but I've sat in a hatch and like, how can you drive this? They would outrun

907
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:48.64
it over everything, you know? And they're like, well, you do run over everything, because it can.

908
01:26:49.92 --> 01:26:55.44
Well, you know what, man, we made those enemies. We made the enemies. Then we're now fighting

909
01:26:55.44 --> 01:27:01.36
the second generation. We're fighting the sons of the men we killed in Torbore. We're fighting the

910
01:27:01.36 --> 01:27:05.76
sons of the men we killed in the Shai-Ka and helmet and everywhere else at the beginning of that war.

911
01:27:07.28 --> 01:27:12.16
We created that enemy. And the same thing happened in Iraq. And you know, let's face it, right?

912
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:18.88
Afghanistan was righteous. You know, I kind of needed to fall. I looking back, is it a good strategy

913
01:27:19.84 --> 01:27:26.80
to topple regimes that are predictable? The Taliban was very predictable. The Taliban has never

914
01:27:27.52 --> 01:27:32.56
met the requirement to be listed as a terrorist organization. They were a sovereign nation.

915
01:27:33.20 --> 01:27:39.28
And yes, they had horrible, horrible means and human rights abuses, but they were a sovereign nation.

916
01:27:39.28 --> 01:27:48.40
And couldophy, sovereign nation. Freaking Iraq, sovereign nation. With dictators and dictators are

917
01:27:48.40 --> 01:27:53.04
predictable. They care about one thing. First and foremost, their main priority is their power.

918
01:27:53.04 --> 01:27:58.08
So they're predictable. You know, in the interviews with Saddam, he talks about like,

919
01:27:58.08 --> 01:28:03.76
I thought y'all were kidding. He was like, I thought y'all were making it up that you thought I

920
01:28:03.76 --> 01:28:08.56
had weapons of mass destruction and I haven't had gas in years. I don't know how many of that stuff.

921
01:28:08.56 --> 01:28:12.88
In his interviews, you know, he's going, I really didn't think y'all were going to invade.

922
01:28:14.72 --> 01:28:21.84
So why did we? I had my own theories. My theory is because people say we went to war for oil.

923
01:28:22.40 --> 01:28:28.08
And like, have you seen the oil prices? We didn't go for war for oil. We went to war with

924
01:28:28.08 --> 01:28:34.72
Iraq to stop its oil production. The prices went up. Because if we pumped oil out of Iraq,

925
01:28:34.72 --> 01:28:39.92
you want to make all the oil companies want to make money. Right? Because that's a new source

926
01:28:39.92 --> 01:28:44.56
that we didn't, they didn't have rights or access to. You stop the oil.

927
01:28:46.24 --> 01:28:51.76
All right. Lower the supply. The man stays at or continues to increase.

928
01:28:52.80 --> 01:28:59.36
It's going up. So that's a little bit of my theory on that, but whatever, either way, at least,

929
01:28:59.36 --> 01:29:03.36
and that's only based off of what I have seen since. When we first invaded Iraq,

930
01:29:03.36 --> 01:29:06.80
we were like, let's go. You know, like every other world, you know, on Trooper.

931
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:12.80
But really, you know, we're talking hundreds of thousands of Iraqians, thousands of Americans.

932
01:29:12.80 --> 01:29:18.48
And what did we get? Right? If you tell me, you know, because war was supposed to be for expansion,

933
01:29:19.92 --> 01:29:24.64
minerals, riches, right? Throughout human history, war has been to expand your empire.

934
01:29:25.76 --> 01:29:31.04
Well, we suck it being an imperial power because we go to these wars and we do nothing with the

935
01:29:31.04 --> 01:29:35.76
spoils. So why do we keep sending Americans? Because let's face it. Was it really for our national

936
01:29:35.76 --> 01:29:41.28
defense? Or was it for our national interests? Because that's two very different things.

937
01:29:41.28 --> 01:29:45.36
Most of my work throughout my life has been for interests. Let's about defense.

938
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.96
Because once Al Qaeda was destroyed and eliminated and even ISIS and Al Qaeda in Iraq,

939
01:29:52.16 --> 01:29:57.60
where they ever really capable of attacking us here.

940
01:29:57.60 --> 01:30:02.64
Yeah, you know, they flew the planes into those towers and killed 3,000 plus people.

941
01:30:03.36 --> 01:30:10.32
But did they ever really threaten our daily lives? Did they threaten America the United States?

942
01:30:10.32 --> 01:30:16.32
Probably not. You know, right? Could they ever brought that war on a large scale to America?

943
01:30:16.32 --> 01:30:20.32
And affected the average Americans they live? No, they didn't have that capability.

944
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:27.36
And I mean, clearly, right? Like, none of that's really, we haven't had any big attacks.

945
01:30:27.36 --> 01:30:32.24
Since 9th November, and I think they just blew their waad. They were done. I don't think they had any

946
01:30:32.24 --> 01:30:38.48
plan after that. It was like, oh crap. Now what? We pissed these guys off and they're coming for us.

947
01:30:39.20 --> 01:30:45.52
Now what? Right? They never really did anything since. So my point is, right? Like,

948
01:30:45.52 --> 01:30:50.48
where has Congress been? Where has our representatives and our Senate been these last 20 years?

949
01:30:51.12 --> 01:30:55.60
Military industrial complex continues to make big time money, big time money.

950
01:30:55.60 --> 01:31:02.000
When our elicit soldiers are in barracks, they're covered in mold, just nastyness, right?

951
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.52
They're living in poverty. Whereas you can go to the General's House on any post.

952
01:31:07.52 --> 01:31:12.000
And it's a well-gruned lawn and it's basically a little mansion, right?

953
01:31:12.72 --> 01:31:18.32
So what did we get out of these wars? Well, that's arguable, right? It's very arguable.

954
01:31:18.32 --> 01:31:26.96
But the bottom line is, Congress has continued to set it aside. It's authority. It's duty.

955
01:31:26.96 --> 01:31:32.16
It's role. It's responsibility to either declare war or cut the funding.

956
01:31:33.44 --> 01:31:38.16
They didn't cut the funding. A lot of people got rich off these wars. And I mean, I was a contractor.

957
01:31:39.36 --> 01:31:46.72
Gilti, I got paid for going to war. Now did I get paid like Glock or, you know, north

958
01:31:46.72 --> 01:31:55.20
or up or right the on or... No, of course not. But... Well, you got a positive outlook.

959
01:31:55.20 --> 01:31:59.44
I believe they're not. From my perspective, because the positive outlook would be that

960
01:31:59.44 --> 01:32:04.40
somebody was smart enough to figure out that if they did this stuff, they'd be able to

961
01:32:05.04 --> 01:32:10.72
raise the price of oil and these other... To me, that's a positive outlook to think that someone

962
01:32:10.72 --> 01:32:14.56
was smart enough to actually craft the things that you're saying. Right.

963
01:32:14.56 --> 01:32:18.24
I don't know if they actually was planned or if they just didn't stumble into it.

964
01:32:18.24 --> 01:32:22.64
Here's why. Because I worry about they, people are at least conspiracy theories. I'm like,

965
01:32:22.64 --> 01:32:26.40
I have time they can't figure out where the bathroom is. That's what makes... That's what

966
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:31.68
disturbs me more than anything else is that it's the arrogance combined with the

967
01:32:32.40 --> 01:32:37.60
being naive, the naive to think, okay, here's what's going on in Iraq. Look,

968
01:32:39.04 --> 01:32:44.08
we know that Saddam's not a good guy. We can probably create some kind of a good ally there.

969
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:49.12
And we can probably just turn this into a democracy because we like democracy and we, you know,

970
01:32:49.12 --> 01:32:53.84
we like it and all those people must want to be free too. And we've got people that came from

971
01:32:53.84 --> 01:32:59.76
Iraq or that are in Iraq that say, hell yeah, we want to be free. So cool. Let's invade.

972
01:32:59.76 --> 01:33:03.84
And in their minds, it plays out, hey, it's going to be like the first Gulf War. It'll take us,

973
01:33:03.84 --> 01:33:08.40
you know, a couple weeks. Then we'll start to get rid of the bath party. We'll establish,

974
01:33:08.40 --> 01:33:12.96
we'll start building Walmart. Right. I think that that's what they thought more than anything else.

975
01:33:12.96 --> 01:33:19.60
Probably. And it's just an arrogant, it's just arrogance. It's well, it's not just arrogance.

976
01:33:19.60 --> 01:33:24.40
It's arrogance and it's ignorance to think that you can go and, you know, there's a,

977
01:33:25.68 --> 01:33:29.12
when it comes to the economy, right? When you start trying to dictate, when you start having

978
01:33:29.12 --> 01:33:34.16
a centralized economy, it's, you cannot pull it off. You can't do it. You can't pull off a centralized

979
01:33:34.16 --> 01:33:38.56
economy. That's why communism doesn't work. You have to let the free market kind of do its thing.

980
01:33:38.56 --> 01:33:45.92
So if you think, if you, if we know that you can't control an economy, which is a finite thing,

981
01:33:45.92 --> 01:33:52.000
and a controllable thing, and some, in some feasible way, and we can't control it. But at least you

982
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.72
can understand what it is. But now we think we're going to take a bunch of millions of people

983
01:33:56.72 --> 01:34:00.72
and predict how they're going to respond and predict what the secondary tertiary effects are

984
01:34:00.72 --> 01:34:05.76
going to be with what they think and how they're going to behave. Like that's completely insane.

985
01:34:05.76 --> 01:34:11.44
To think that we, we think we are going to control the future with other people. We think we understand

986
01:34:11.44 --> 01:34:19.44
what they're doing. We can't. So we have to start behaving in a way that we utilize our power

987
01:34:20.08 --> 01:34:25.76
to make, to attempt to influence. But we can't think to ourselves that the things are going to

988
01:34:25.76 --> 01:34:30.88
play out. The way we think they're going to play out because they don't. They couldn't even figure

989
01:34:30.88 --> 01:34:35.84
out these two freaking guys in Afghanistan. One of them is from England. Hey everyone's going to

990
01:34:35.84 --> 01:34:40.08
listen this guy. Meanwhile, this is local here that's been running shit for years. And we think

991
01:34:40.08 --> 01:34:43.52
this other guy is going to fly in from England. He speaks English. He must be smart. Everyone's going to listen

992
01:34:43.52 --> 01:34:48.72
him. No. No. And then you just play that out over and over and over again in a bunch of different

993
01:34:48.72 --> 01:34:54.88
scenarios in Iraq and in Afghanistan and in Iraq. And that's what you end up with. So that's why

994
01:34:54.88 --> 01:35:01.36
I'm so happy that guys like you are stepping up people that understand that we don't understand.

995
01:35:01.36 --> 01:35:05.20
Right. People that understand that we can't control everything. People that understand that the

996
01:35:05.20 --> 01:35:09.28
enemy gets a vote. This civilians gets a vote. Like all those things come into play.

997
01:35:09.28 --> 01:35:13.20
Right. And we run around like we can figure it all out. Nothing is too close to you. It was

998
01:35:13.20 --> 01:35:18.72
four. No. It's always an equation with hundreds, if not thousands of variables. And at any time

999
01:35:18.72 --> 01:35:24.56
you change one variable to get the continued result, you're going to have to change every variable

1000
01:35:24.56 --> 01:35:30.48
or many of them. Right. And Americans, we couple are the arrogance. Right. So what is,

1001
01:35:30.48 --> 01:35:37.28
I always say arrogance is ignorance and cockiness combined. And in Lord knows we are a lot of

1002
01:35:37.28 --> 01:35:45.52
ignorance. And then you've got the cockiness. And we think we really think that people want 5G or 4G

1003
01:35:45.52 --> 01:35:50.48
or 3G or whatever it was 10 years ago. They want that. But you've got this culture that no one wants

1004
01:35:50.48 --> 01:35:56.08
to bother to understand. Who understands the culture of the afghanies? Who understands the culture

1005
01:35:56.08 --> 01:36:04.16
of the Azidi and Northern Iraq or the Kurds in very North Iraq or the Shia in Southeastern?

1006
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:10.32
Who understands this stuff? The guy on the ground. The guy on the ground. You know, we were talking

1007
01:36:10.32 --> 01:36:15.92
about, you know, you familiar with Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Sheller and Marine Corps. He was on the

1008
01:36:15.92 --> 01:36:20.16
podcast, yeah. He was on the podcast, right? Right. Yeah. I haven't talked to him a couple weeks.

1009
01:36:20.16 --> 01:36:27.04
He and I went down to the border. And I told him, like, hey, bro, I got a, so he and I joke about

1010
01:36:27.04 --> 01:36:32.72
how we met. We talked through it. We were on with Evan and J.T. with the Plight Rifle and we were

1011
01:36:32.72 --> 01:36:39.52
talking about how we met. It's a pretty funny story. But we went down there and we talked with a

1012
01:36:39.52 --> 01:36:45.60
border patrol agent who's a very good friend of mine and of course, off unofficial because he would get

1013
01:36:45.60 --> 01:36:51.36
fired for even entertaining having a conversation with a congressional candidate or House of

1014
01:36:51.36 --> 01:36:55.92
Representatives candidate. But he talked to us and he showed us some places where he'd go and look

1015
01:36:55.92 --> 01:37:03.84
before and broke it down for us. Nothing in the media that I had heard was anything like the

1016
01:37:03.84 --> 01:37:09.60
border really is. At least in this section in this section of Texas around Rome and Rio Grande

1017
01:37:09.60 --> 01:37:16.08
city. And it was just nothing like I thought because we were on the ground. He, that fellow that

1018
01:37:16.08 --> 01:37:20.08
border patrol agent, he's the guy on the ground. I just went and got some info from him. We went

1019
01:37:20.08 --> 01:37:25.36
driving around and stuff and looked and everything he told us was exactly the way it was. And I was

1020
01:37:25.36 --> 01:37:30.000
like, oh, we grabbed him. But the border patrols on them basically a gag order man. They talked

1021
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.92
to somebody. They did their jobs over done. So, yeah man, kind of shellernight, the funny thing

1022
01:37:37.92 --> 01:37:45.52
is man, he, I got word that he might run for House. He went out of the Marine Corriette and

1023
01:37:46.56 --> 01:37:53.84
and I had an outstead either. So a friend's of ours, some mutual friend, a major who had

1024
01:37:53.84 --> 01:38:00.56
worked for Colonel, I reached out and was like, hey, he's like, hey, does that give me your numbers?

1025
01:38:00.56 --> 01:38:07.12
He says you want to talk to me? Like, yes, sir, you know, our career paths may be about to collide.

1026
01:38:07.12 --> 01:38:12.32
Be nice if we could just meet face to face in chat. He was like, okay, well, I'm up in Emerald

1027
01:38:12.32 --> 01:38:19.04
I'll, you want to come up here. Yeah, House tomorrow morning. Set down. It was like, here you think

1028
01:38:19.04 --> 01:38:25.68
about running into fourth and he was, because apparently at that time he had told two people,

1029
01:38:25.68 --> 01:38:31.04
the fact that I knew it blew him away. He's like, whoa, he's dead. You know, luckily my team,

1030
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:37.60
my consulting team are very well connected and super smart guys or whatever. So anyway, we sat

1031
01:38:37.60 --> 01:38:42.56
in chat and it was really cool conversation. I'm talking about mature adult conversation because

1032
01:38:42.56 --> 01:38:46.88
he could have easily been like, you know, an arrogant dick and been like, whatever, I'll run

1033
01:38:46.88 --> 01:38:53.04
guess whoever I want. But we said, hmm, we're two very similar types. Do we really need to run

1034
01:38:53.04 --> 01:38:58.48
against each other? I live in the fourth. He doesn't. And now it's not the fourth anymore, but we can

1035
01:38:58.48 --> 01:39:02.48
get to that. And I was just really cool conversation a little coffee shop there in Emerald Island,

1036
01:39:02.48 --> 01:39:06.88
North Carolina, and we left it with, and I just, you know, I gained a lot of respect for the man

1037
01:39:06.88 --> 01:39:10.08
when he was like, okay, I tell you why I'm going to think this over. I don't even know if I'm

1038
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:14.40
going to get out of the Marine Corps enough time to even, you know, get in the race, my wise. I'm

1039
01:39:14.40 --> 01:39:20.40
thinking over. He's like, we're doing an announcement this day. He's like, okay, well, two days

1040
01:39:20.40 --> 01:39:24.56
prior, I'll let you know. He's like, at least then, you'll know if we're running against each other.

1041
01:39:24.56 --> 01:39:30.88
I'm like, Roger that. Thanks. Anyway, the Marine Corps didn't work out or whatever, and it didn't

1042
01:39:30.88 --> 01:39:39.12
work out for him. I would like to think he'll run in 2024, you know? I know he's considering it.

1043
01:39:39.12 --> 01:39:44.96
I'm not going to happen in two years, but yeah, man, what a good guy. And he's definitely a Marine

1044
01:39:44.96 --> 01:39:51.12
Corps officer, right? Like, you know, you guys thought whether he's wrong, you know, but that, we

1045
01:39:51.12 --> 01:39:56.88
need some of that, man. We need some of that. I mean, that dude threw his 17-ounce 18-year career

1046
01:39:57.68 --> 01:40:04.24
out the window to just stand up and say something, which is funny because like, I hear and see

1047
01:40:04.24 --> 01:40:09.68
people on the internet, like, condemn and import. And I'm like, enlist it, guys. I'm like, fellas,

1048
01:40:10.40 --> 01:40:17.60
we have been begging, pleading, wishing, a colonel would stand up. And now you are trying to say

1049
01:40:17.60 --> 01:40:22.56
this, this man is doing it for recognition. Like, just sit down and talk to him for two minutes,

1050
01:40:22.56 --> 01:40:30.80
and you'll find it out, not so much. But yeah, we were in Roma taxes and we found out, we're looking,

1051
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:34.56
like, the people aren't coming across the border in the middle of the desert. They're coming

1052
01:40:34.56 --> 01:40:38.56
across, like the bridge that goes across, there's the Border Patrol checkpoint at Roma.

1053
01:40:38.56 --> 01:40:42.32
They're walking under the bridge, coming up, hitting the cul-de-sac, and every night they get picked

1054
01:40:42.32 --> 01:40:45.92
up by the Border Patrol buses and taking a timid facility. You're not thinking across in the

1055
01:40:45.92 --> 01:40:49.60
middle of the desert, walking right up in the town, sitting down, getting picked up every night.

1056
01:40:50.16 --> 01:40:54.80
That's been going on for months, right? This whole shipping them around the nation,

1057
01:40:54.80 --> 01:40:59.60
saying, that's not new. It's been going on for months. I had no idea. Those headlines had just

1058
01:40:59.60 --> 01:41:03.12
broke the day before. I was like, oh, a crap, when did this start happening? My buddy was like,

1059
01:41:03.12 --> 01:41:08.48
bro, we've been shipping illegal around this country for nine months, bro.

1060
01:41:09.28 --> 01:41:15.28
He's like, the numbers are down. Yeah, he's like, yeah, it was 2000 coming across the border in this

1061
01:41:15.28 --> 01:41:22.40
little section every night. He was, and then the cartels figured out and they all figured out, right?

1062
01:41:22.40 --> 01:41:29.52
That the Border Patrol can only pick up about 200 and 9 now. So now only 200 and 9,

1063
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:35.20
come across. On the other side, on the backside of the border, they have warehouses or hotels,

1064
01:41:35.20 --> 01:41:42.32
and it costs the stay there. But then we let 200 each night. So the cartel, the cost to come across the

1065
01:41:42.32 --> 01:41:51.68
border, not being fair, not good coyote, not transportation. The cartels tax or fee to walk across

1066
01:41:51.68 --> 01:41:58.24
the border to get your armband. So you can walk across the border, it's like, armband. But the cartel

1067
01:41:58.24 --> 01:42:07.52
gives them an armband legit. On band on our side, nothing but trash. On bands. It's like going into a club.

1068
01:42:07.52 --> 01:42:12.72
You pay, you get your armband, you're clear to go across. Well, and armbands are color-coded from

1069
01:42:12.72 --> 01:42:18.08
which country you come from because in those warehouses that you can see from America right over there

1070
01:42:18.08 --> 01:42:24.32
on the mic side, they're basically hotels, it's just carts and and format. Every night, you stay

1071
01:42:24.32 --> 01:42:28.64
there's a hundred dollars to walk across that borders, nine hundred to twelve hundred dollars

1072
01:42:28.64 --> 01:42:35.60
going where you, where you come from. Or if you don't want to spend a couple nights in that hotel warehouse,

1073
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:44.000
you can pay more. But that's what it costs. In Texas alone last year, 1.7 million illegal immigrants,

1074
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.48
illegal crosses of our border were detained. But just how many were detained in Texas. Just Texas.

1075
01:42:50.48 --> 01:42:55.52
That's how many more to detained. Now how many people came along across and this whole evolution of

1076
01:42:55.52 --> 01:43:00.80
the book, Border Patrol and Customs facilitating the integration and fairing throughout the country.

1077
01:43:00.80 --> 01:43:06.16
It used to be, you know, counties with continued and pickup. We destroyed that business and gave it all the

1078
01:43:06.16 --> 01:43:12.80
cartels. So 1.7 million, let's say, a thousand bucks, times a thousand dollars.

1079
01:43:14.40 --> 01:43:19.20
And we can only guess that double that were not in detained. So let's just call it an even three

1080
01:43:19.20 --> 01:43:24.40
mill, times a thousand dollars. That's what we gave the cartels just in Mexico.

1081
01:43:25.68 --> 01:43:31.60
And when I say we gave it to him, we created this marketplace for them. That's what this administration

1082
01:43:31.60 --> 01:43:38.40
did by opening the borders. They created a marketplace where the cartels now, they don't really even

1083
01:43:38.40 --> 01:43:43.44
care about drugs. The drugs that are coming across our border now are coming across in a backpack,

1084
01:43:43.44 --> 01:43:47.92
not truckloads. There's no more marijuana coming across in truckloads. That's very,

1085
01:43:47.92 --> 01:43:51.84
they're not seizing marijuana anymore. It's backpacks of fentanyl and heroin.

1086
01:43:53.12 --> 01:43:58.16
Because 30 pound backpack of fentanyl, I can damn near kill the whole East Coast.

1087
01:43:59.44 --> 01:44:05.76
Stuff is so potent. 30, 40 pounds of black tar, unprocessed, opium, hash, bring it to the

1088
01:44:05.76 --> 01:44:11.52
state's process in the heroin. One backpack turns into freaking half a million dollars worth of heroin.

1089
01:44:11.52 --> 01:44:19.04
How do we combat that if we don't get serious about true border security and even beyond that,

1090
01:44:19.04 --> 01:44:25.92
right? Because no, no, that's one of my problems with Americans, but Republicans more so

1091
01:44:25.92 --> 01:44:36.08
that everything's a linear solution, build a wall. And then what? No one's asking and then what?

1092
01:44:36.88 --> 01:44:40.72
So we build this wall. We're going to do it. Put guns on it. People are like, yeah. Okay. So we're

1093
01:44:40.72 --> 01:44:45.52
going to shoot our southern neighbors who want to come to America. Okay? I don't blame them for

1094
01:44:45.52 --> 01:44:51.44
wanting to come here, but there's a line getting the back of it. There's a line to come here.

1095
01:44:52.16 --> 01:44:56.24
So yes, it's got to be multifaceted, right? It can't be just build a wall.

1096
01:44:57.36 --> 01:45:01.20
That's not solving the problem. That's just a measure to slow

1097
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.48
part of the result of the problem, the illegal immigration. Why are our neighbors wanting to

1098
01:45:06.48 --> 01:45:10.72
come here so badly? Because all our southern neighbors, their countries are crap.

1099
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.32
Had we adhered to the monorodotron and quit worried about Europe and quit worrying about them,

1100
01:45:18.32 --> 01:45:21.92
Middle East. I mean, we spent billions in movies. What if we'd invested that in our southern

1101
01:45:21.92 --> 01:45:26.72
neighbors instead of letting say, I don't know, one of the richest, richest wealthiest countries in the

1102
01:45:26.72 --> 01:45:34.64
world, Venezuela, fall of communism right underneath our noses? Why? Why did we do that? Why are we not?

1103
01:45:34.64 --> 01:45:42.16
Actually, hoping, Mexico. Oh, we want to take these hard lines and look like a bunch of tough guys.

1104
01:45:42.16 --> 01:45:49.36
It's not solving the problem. And it kills me that that's all all these solutions, right? When you

1105
01:45:49.36 --> 01:45:53.68
like all my opponents across the nation, if you if you talk to Republican candidates for any

1106
01:45:53.68 --> 01:45:58.72
office from city council, probably to the next president, they're going to have one

1107
01:45:58.72 --> 01:46:04.24
linear solution for any problem you talk to them about because what talking points. But no one's

1108
01:46:04.24 --> 01:46:12.16
actually discussing root causes of problems. So the border security, a wall, is a measure, not a

1109
01:46:12.16 --> 01:46:18.48
solution. It's not, it's not going to solve the problem. You're building a wall, well, there's these

1110
01:46:18.48 --> 01:46:25.28
two bodies of water on each side of it, right? You know, the deal, there's not a single security

1111
01:46:25.28 --> 01:46:32.08
measure put on this planet. Whatever you build, whether security protocol you build, there's

1112
01:46:32.08 --> 01:46:36.48
just guys like us that can get around it, right? It's just like lawyers, right? Lawyers can write

1113
01:46:36.48 --> 01:46:40.96
about to legal documents and then some other lawyers can figure out how to screw that. It's the

1114
01:46:40.96 --> 01:46:46.24
same thing. It's not warfare. It's like, you're going to be does this. They set up these obstacles.

1115
01:46:46.24 --> 01:46:52.88
You figure out how to get around them. Well, here's an idea. Let's address it at its root cause.

1116
01:46:52.88 --> 01:47:04.08
And I don't know, maybe the demand to come here. Well, let's say 20 years from now. Oh my God.

1117
01:47:04.08 --> 01:47:08.08
And that's not an American thing, right? 20 years from now? Next election cycle only.

1118
01:47:08.08 --> 01:47:13.28
Four years old, right? Americans think in four year blocks if we're lucky. What if 20 years

1119
01:47:13.28 --> 01:47:20.40
from now? Mexico is a thriving ally. And there's no cartels. We help them get rid of it. We give

1120
01:47:20.40 --> 01:47:27.76
them incentives to stop teaming up with the cartels. Same goes for Panama, Costa Rica,

1121
01:47:27.76 --> 01:47:32.56
and at Garagua, Salvador. We help them with the game problems. We hope them. And I don't mean just

1122
01:47:32.56 --> 01:47:43.60
toss money at it. Wece money. When I say invest, right? Invest means there's a implied return on

1123
01:47:43.60 --> 01:47:52.24
that investment. Americans, when our Congress just allocates funds, they just throw money in things.

1124
01:47:52.24 --> 01:47:58.24
They don't actually follow up or have measures in place to ensure our return on investment.

1125
01:47:59.04 --> 01:48:03.44
So my point here is, man, that's part of why I'm running is I'm so tired of these very

1126
01:48:03.44 --> 01:48:12.96
literal band-aids to hemorrhaging wounds. And the wall is just one great example of that.

1127
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:21.60
I mean, name any other hot topic right now. Abortion, banning. The same people that say banning

1128
01:48:21.60 --> 01:48:26.32
abortion will solve that problem. The same people that will tell you that banning guns won't

1129
01:48:26.32 --> 01:48:33.04
get rid of guns. Where's the logic and reason here, folks? So like with abortion,

1130
01:48:33.04 --> 01:48:38.24
yeah, man, it's horrible. I mean, even people who are pro-choice will go, yeah, it's bad.

1131
01:48:39.04 --> 01:48:45.36
And it's very, only the craziest of the crazy are like four abortion, right? That's human beings are

1132
01:48:45.36 --> 01:48:52.96
not for killing unborn children. Generally speaking. So why are we having abortions?

1133
01:48:55.12 --> 01:49:00.08
Let's make a middle eagle. Okay. Cool. Let's make a middle eagle. We're done. But we're not done.

1134
01:49:00.08 --> 01:49:08.32
Could we just have it addressed? Why are we? Why are women wanting or feeling that need

1135
01:49:08.32 --> 01:49:15.60
to abort their unborn child? First of all, the three of us will never, ever be able to

1136
01:49:16.48 --> 01:49:24.000
understand sympathize with a woman that is so desperate that she wants to abort her child.

1137
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.56
Right? I just, first of all, we have to say that out loud, right?

1138
01:49:28.56 --> 01:49:34.56
Okay. So let's bring in the experts. Let's talk to some ladies. I know that sounds crazy, right?

1139
01:49:34.56 --> 01:49:40.000
Let's go find the subject matter experts and figure out why this is happening. Well,

1140
01:49:40.88 --> 01:49:44.88
I asked people all in time, what's the number one demographic in America having abortions?

1141
01:49:46.72 --> 01:49:52.96
Do you guys know? Put your on the spot, right? Yeah, I was a little surprised too. 17 to 22-year-old

1142
01:49:52.96 --> 01:50:00.96
upper-middle-class white women. Why? Well, because their fathers have told them they need to

1143
01:50:00.96 --> 01:50:05.44
go to college because modern feminism have told them they need to go to college. They need to get

1144
01:50:05.44 --> 01:50:15.52
careers in a child in heaven's now. Right? And this is a very summarize version of this very,

1145
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:24.56
very complex problem. So what if we as a community, as a government, right? It's okay for the

1146
01:50:24.56 --> 01:50:30.000
government to do things for the community, right? Like we can, we can have some good social welfare

1147
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:37.44
problems, right? Things that support the wellness of our communities and our culture and our nation.

1148
01:50:38.88 --> 01:50:43.52
So when I use welfare, I don't mean just throwing money at stuff and not expecting some type of return.

1149
01:50:43.52 --> 01:50:51.12
So if we start saying okay, what if we create a robust and efficient adoption program?

1150
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:58.000
What if there's assistance for these women to carry their children to terms that have

1151
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.76
terminating them? What if? And I say what if? Because I don't know the answer, right? And that's

1152
01:51:03.76 --> 01:51:07.68
weird for a political candidate to tell you he doesn't know for sure what he's talking about, right?

1153
01:51:07.68 --> 01:51:13.04
But we know that, right? We come up with courses of actions and then say, okay, we're going to do

1154
01:51:13.04 --> 01:51:18.56
this and then we try to anticipate what our adversary is going to do if we do X, they'll do Y and

1155
01:51:18.56 --> 01:51:24.88
then this is how it, well that's how we have to war game all these things, right? So if we sit down

1156
01:51:24.88 --> 01:51:29.36
and say okay, because here's a really bad thing about the adoption process in America today.

1157
01:51:31.12 --> 01:51:36.80
Mimilists are not married, right? We see marriage as an agreement between Xi and I and God,

1158
01:51:36.80 --> 01:51:44.80
not the state of North Carolina. Also, she's a very pragmatic, practical person and she wants to

1159
01:51:44.80 --> 01:51:49.44
hold the whole thing that if she gets tired of me, she can just boot me or walk away.

1160
01:51:49.44 --> 01:51:54.40
How long have you all been together? 10 and a half years. We're married. In my eyes, my heart,

1161
01:51:54.40 --> 01:51:58.16
my soul, I married to that woman and she's the most precious thing on this planet to me,

1162
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:06.32
right? Like precious. She's the only one. That's how precious she is. So if Xi and I wanted to adopt,

1163
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:15.04
it could take three to five years. If me and you want to adopt, right? We could have a kid in the year

1164
01:52:15.04 --> 01:52:21.12
or less. That's how our cultures evolve now, right? A gay couple can adopt very quickly.

1165
01:52:22.32 --> 01:52:28.48
It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. Or, Mimilists could go out of the country and

1166
01:52:28.48 --> 01:52:34.72
buy a child. We could adopt from Africa or China or the space that you're buying a child when you do that.

1167
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:39.36
Because it costs a lot of money, but you can do it and you can do it in a matter of weeks.

1168
01:52:40.72 --> 01:52:43.04
Typically speaking, when someone adopts out of Africa,

1169
01:52:44.32 --> 01:52:48.56
different countries different way, right? But you go over, you visit, come back,

1170
01:52:48.56 --> 01:52:53.84
go back for the next trip and you have your child. It's efficient. And it's a good thing, right?

1171
01:52:53.84 --> 01:52:58.08
Like these are parents who want children who can't have them for whatever reason.

1172
01:52:58.88 --> 01:53:03.28
And then there are these children that need parents. We have so many in America,

1173
01:53:03.28 --> 01:53:08.24
but so why are Americans leaving America? The United States to adopt children from other countries.

1174
01:53:08.24 --> 01:53:14.16
When we have kids right here, we have an abortion problem. Why? Because it's easier.

1175
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:21.04
You know, like, let's face it, right? I mean, let's say, let's say Melissa couldn't have kids.

1176
01:53:21.04 --> 01:53:25.04
It's not why we don't have kids. We don't have kids because it's just kind of a choice. We've been

1177
01:53:25.04 --> 01:53:36.08
busy. She's been busy with her career and I've been busy with mine. And so if we wanted to, it takes time,

1178
01:53:37.36 --> 01:53:43.44
but we could go get a kid. It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense. So my point to all that is,

1179
01:53:43.44 --> 01:53:51.52
whether it's the border or abortion or name it, you've got all these candidates and these politicians,

1180
01:53:51.52 --> 01:53:55.68
right? Because right now a lot of politicians sitting already elective politicians, they're now candidates.

1181
01:53:55.68 --> 01:53:59.44
Again, midterms are coming. They have these one lineers, these talking points.

1182
01:54:00.72 --> 01:54:06.08
And then they go back to DC and they don't really do anything. It's so frustrating to me, man.

1183
01:54:06.08 --> 01:54:11.28
Because let's face it, right? We're problem solvers. We're given problems every single day,

1184
01:54:11.28 --> 01:54:16.000
whether it's how to fit that much equipment on that one truck, because that other truck is deadline.

1185
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.80
Right? Or supply won't give us another truck, because some sort major, we need that truck

1186
01:54:23.84 --> 01:54:35.20
for his ride to the Chalhall or whatever. We solve problems with very little. And at this point,

1187
01:54:35.20 --> 01:54:42.000
in our nation's history and future, present and future, we need those type of people.

1188
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:50.64
Need guys from our community and gals from the global world, terrorism, those type of veterans,

1189
01:54:50.64 --> 01:54:57.28
who are problem solvers, who have seen the neglect and the abuse and the fraud waste and abuse.

1190
01:54:57.28 --> 01:55:01.84
That's what these wars have been. Afghanistan highlights it. But people don't realize how many

1191
01:55:01.84 --> 01:55:07.60
billions of dollars of equipment we left in Iraq too, that we had to destroy in Syria, because they

1192
01:55:07.60 --> 01:55:12.40
just took it, drove it across the border and then bought us with it. But there's still billions of

1193
01:55:12.40 --> 01:55:20.08
a billion of dollars of equipment in Iraq. Now we haven't abandoned Iraq. We abandoned Iraq too.

1194
01:55:20.08 --> 01:55:26.16
It was just less publicized, less emotional for a lot of the servicemen and women, because of

1195
01:55:27.52 --> 01:55:32.40
just the way I've got to stand happen. So quickly, it was really easy for the media to cover,

1196
01:55:32.40 --> 01:55:36.88
so on and so forth. And then all the debacle in Kabul, what the airfield, that was definitely

1197
01:55:36.88 --> 01:55:44.96
the media love, and I don't fancy you. Yeah, it was a disastrous show. I rack happened over

1198
01:55:44.96 --> 01:55:50.56
a course of numerous years. And they're not interesting. Probably not coming up. So anyway,

1199
01:55:51.52 --> 01:55:56.64
one thing I talk about a lot when I talk about leadership, I wrote about one of the books

1200
01:55:56.64 --> 01:56:02.08
iterative decision making process, which means you don't know necessarily what's going to happen

1201
01:56:02.08 --> 01:56:06.32
and you don't necessarily have all the information. So what do you do? You sit there and just

1202
01:56:06.32 --> 01:56:10.80
do nothing? No, you go, okay, well, here's a step that I think this might have an impact

1203
01:56:10.80 --> 01:56:15.44
a positive impact. Let me try this one step. But you try that one step. Then you get what the

1204
01:56:15.44 --> 01:56:20.000
feedback is. If the feedback is good, you say, until you get it. Okay. Well, that was good. Let's

1205
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
do a little bit more in that direction. Okay, great. Oh, but it's still working. That's super.

1206
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.84
Oh, let's try a little bit more in that direction. Oh, wait a second. Now we're getting negative

1207
01:56:27.84 --> 01:56:34.000
feedback. What we thought was going to happen isn't happening. Do we double down? No, we actually say,

1208
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.84
oh, let's make some adjustments to what our plan, what our strategy is. And that's what was as you

1209
01:56:39.84 --> 01:56:48.48
look at Afghanistan and Iraq and Vietnam. You can see inflection points along the way where

1210
01:56:49.52 --> 01:56:55.20
the direction we were going was not clearly giving good feedback. Now do you immediately abandon it?

1211
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:59.60
No, maybe press. Okay. Let's try a little more. Let's make some adjustments. Oh, wait a second.

1212
01:56:59.60 --> 01:57:03.84
Oh, wait. It's definitely not working. Okay. So what should we do? We should try a different plan

1213
01:57:03.84 --> 01:57:07.12
we should try a different strategy. And we shouldn't be afraid to say, you know what? We were wrong

1214
01:57:07.12 --> 01:57:13.76
about this and we are going to back out and we are going to provide a different type of effort

1215
01:57:13.76 --> 01:57:18.96
to try and solve this problem. So like you said, a lot of politicians, a lot of, that's just

1216
01:57:18.96 --> 01:57:25.60
politics. People, human beings don't want to say, hey, wrong. I messed up here. I was wrong about this.

1217
01:57:25.60 --> 01:57:30.40
Here's my adjustments. Here's what we're going to do. I'm open to ideas. COVID.

1218
01:57:30.40 --> 01:57:37.36
Good. First, we're talking about all of us. We're like, okay. Yeah, man, I started carrying some

1219
01:57:37.36 --> 01:57:45.12
hand sanitizer. I, you know, I put Melissa go back together for the first time. I'm not really a

1220
01:57:45.12 --> 01:57:49.20
proper. I'm more about wealth. She has fan. I've got enough that I'll be able to make it right.

1221
01:57:49.20 --> 01:57:54.64
I'm being brought to the home. I'm good, right? I'm mentally bad. You know, she drives back and forth

1222
01:57:54.64 --> 01:57:59.20
to Wilmington, you know, an hour. So I was like, you know what, you know, she competes in three

1223
01:57:59.20 --> 01:58:03.12
gun and she's doing some of the tactical games and all that kind of stuff. I mean, she can shoot,

1224
01:58:03.12 --> 01:58:07.28
right? She goes to rank fireself and I, you know, she's got her own info and all that kind of stuff.

1225
01:58:07.28 --> 01:58:12.88
So we actually packed it up through a little 72 hour go bag in her trunk, right? We were all like,

1226
01:58:12.88 --> 01:58:18.48
this pandemic might be something within about six weeks, we were like, hmm, and we all knew

1227
01:58:18.48 --> 01:58:22.88
like these cloth mass, right? Like we've all done Seaburn, right? We've all done some counter

1228
01:58:22.88 --> 01:58:28.40
proliferation of biological nuclear. And it those, those suits and the gas mass and all these stuff,

1229
01:58:28.40 --> 01:58:33.68
right? It's like that might stop over that might. And now you're telling me this mask is

1230
01:58:33.68 --> 01:58:39.28
like, we all knew it was just horses. No, I got a handkerchief all I'm good. Hi. And I think maybe like you

1231
01:58:39.28 --> 01:58:44.24
said like, with the right, we, you know, I don't think it really, like it didn't, it started out good

1232
01:58:44.24 --> 01:58:49.36
in intention. Yeah. And like you said about Afghanistan when we got to Iraq, there was, there was

1233
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:55.12
Iraqis wave in American flags and welcome, Mr. And they wanted us to be there. And even,

1234
01:58:55.12 --> 01:59:01.60
I was there in 2003, 2004, 2006, all the way that through that time, there was the local Iraqi

1235
01:59:01.60 --> 01:59:10.72
populists wanted us there. And by the way, in 2012, 13, and when I started to flex,

1236
01:59:11.44 --> 01:59:15.84
there was there was plenty of Iraqi government officials and people on the ground saying,

1237
01:59:15.84 --> 01:59:19.52
please America, please come help us. Hey, we need some help over here. We weren't thinking

1238
01:59:19.52 --> 01:59:25.60
to these guys would come back, but here they are, and we need some help. Please come help us. So we can't

1239
01:59:25.60 --> 01:59:30.96
ignore the part of the population, that wants that, right, when you call the problem, you're kind

1240
01:59:30.96 --> 01:59:37.04
of obligated to deal with it, right? We call that problem Iraq. I was all forward with withdrawal

1241
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:41.52
and the Obama administration that withdrawal. But once they decided that we're going to withdraw,

1242
01:59:41.52 --> 01:59:45.84
there came a point when ISIS rose up that we needed to halt the withdrawal, deal with ISIS,

1243
01:59:45.84 --> 01:59:50.48
and then pick back up with the withdrawal. But since they started the withdrawal, they couldn't

1244
01:59:50.48 --> 01:59:55.52
say they made a mistake. Americans will never, we just don't like to say they're there. I told

1245
01:59:55.52 --> 02:00:01.36
to my other day, I was like, I will kiss your white ass live on whatever social media platform you

1246
02:00:01.36 --> 02:00:06.72
want to go live on. If you can find me a politician and elected official that has said,

1247
02:00:06.72 --> 02:00:12.64
you know what? I realized now I was wrong and find me one politician who has said that.

1248
02:00:12.64 --> 02:00:17.60
Yeah. And the crazy thing is from an ego perspective. People think if I say, hey guys,

1249
02:00:17.60 --> 02:00:20.88
all is wrong about this, you think everyone's going to think you're a loser now. No, they actually

1250
02:00:20.88 --> 02:00:25.28
go, yeah, well, cool. I'm glad you admitted that and we didn't know either, like you were bringing

1251
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:30.16
up the example of COVID. Hey, okay, it looks like a bunch of people in Italy are dying. They're showing

1252
02:00:30.16 --> 02:00:33.84
these pictures of people dying in the hospitals. They're all overcrowded. This looks like it's going to

1253
02:00:33.84 --> 02:00:38.56
suck. Cool. Oh, you want us to stand down for a few weeks here. Cool. We're going to flatten the

1254
02:00:38.56 --> 02:00:42.64
curve. What does that mean? We don't want our hospitals overwhelmed. Okay, God. We need time to

1255
02:00:42.64 --> 02:00:48.48
prepare. Sure sounds good. Okay. Now we need another two weeks. Okay, hey, hey, you know what?

1256
02:00:48.48 --> 02:00:52.80
I'm American. I support American. I want to have people get her. Okay, cool. God. When I

1257
02:00:52.80 --> 02:00:55.52
you want another two weeks, now you want another two months, now you want another six months,

1258
02:00:55.52 --> 02:00:59.84
now you want another year. And then after a year, we find out that the death rates,

1259
02:01:01.28 --> 02:01:06.08
you know, most of the people aren't dying from COVID or dying from something else and COVID accelerated.

1260
02:01:06.08 --> 02:01:14.16
And that's fine. I get it. You know, but we now have information and data, right? That says

1261
02:01:14.16 --> 02:01:20.96
all the measures that we did they didn't help. We've got a vaccine that really isn't, right? By,

1262
02:01:20.96 --> 02:01:25.92
you know, they had to change the definition of vaccine. Yeah. Right? Like, could you imagine

1263
02:01:25.92 --> 02:01:32.64
getting three polio vaccines and then getting from a polio? Yeah, that's not right. We got rid of that.

1264
02:01:32.64 --> 02:01:38.48
That vaccine got rid of that disease, right? This vaccine supposedly makes your symptoms less.

1265
02:01:39.44 --> 02:01:47.12
But it could kill you. Right? Like, it that's one that says this one one drug we haven't seen

1266
02:01:47.12 --> 02:01:51.20
commercials for, right? Because all those drug commercials and TV is like when they when they get

1267
02:01:51.20 --> 02:01:55.52
into the fight for it, you know, speaking really fast about all the side effects is like, and it could kill,

1268
02:01:55.52 --> 02:01:59.76
you know, you could have crazy diarrhea and you could bleed from your nose and maybe your

1269
02:01:59.76 --> 02:02:04.72
anus and then you might very well die from this kidney failure, you know, and people are like,

1270
02:02:04.72 --> 02:02:11.84
okay, but ask your doctor, but your skin will be clearer after two weeks. Right? Could you imagine

1271
02:02:11.84 --> 02:02:17.28
what the, you know, Johnson and Johnson vaccine got pulled, right? Why? Let's not talk about it.

1272
02:02:17.28 --> 02:02:20.88
Let's just talk about another vaccine because of that J, J is vaccine killed some people.

1273
02:02:21.44 --> 02:02:25.68
American people don't even know so many people don't even know that Johnson and Johnson vaccine

1274
02:02:25.68 --> 02:02:30.64
was pulled and then it had killed people with strokes and you know, thanks to your medical

1275
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:37.28
terms and I know. Huh, right? Like we won't just step back and say, hey, we now have different

1276
02:02:37.28 --> 02:02:42.56
information. We're going to adjust this plan. Yeah. And by the way, on that, you can say, hey,

1277
02:02:43.76 --> 02:02:47.76
there are, here's the fine print on the vaccine. Here's what it can do to here the side effects you

1278
02:02:47.76 --> 02:02:54.72
can have and make a choice, you know, as a human being, if you have some compromised immune system

1279
02:02:54.72 --> 02:03:00.72
or you're living in some situation where this COVID according to all the statistics could be really

1280
02:03:00.72 --> 02:03:05.60
bad for you. Maybe that vaccine is a godsend. That's awesome. Maybe a mask is great for you.

1281
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:12.000
Yeah. But if you're a person that's young and healthy and you feel like you could, oh, and you know,

1282
02:03:12.64 --> 02:03:16.16
a bunch of people that I've had it and it didn't impact them at all and you say, hey,

1283
02:03:16.16 --> 02:03:19.12
I don't think I'm going to need that vaccine. It doesn't seem like it's worth the risk. So that's

1284
02:03:19.12 --> 02:03:23.12
my decision. So you let people make a decision about what they're going to do with their health,

1285
02:03:23.12 --> 02:03:30.32
that seems like a much smarter move than trying to impose things on people, which I've gone

1286
02:03:30.32 --> 02:03:35.12
off on this a bunch. When you try to impose things on human beings, we fight, especially Americans,

1287
02:03:35.12 --> 02:03:39.60
they don't like it. We don't like it. But all human beings don't like it. All human beings don't like to

1288
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:45.04
have things imposed on them. And the only way you can impose things effectively is to do it through

1289
02:03:45.04 --> 02:03:49.52
force, through violence or now we're recently finding out that you can also do it by

1290
02:03:49.52 --> 02:03:54.08
taking their money and seizing their assets before they can even know what's happening.

1291
02:03:54.80 --> 02:04:00.40
Which I never, I never really thought of that before. It didn't even occur to me that like what's

1292
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:04.40
going on in Canada right now. Oh, you're going to protest cool. We're not just going to rest.

1293
02:04:04.40 --> 02:04:10.72
You're going to seize your assets. That to me is like when you come to my property and you say you're

1294
02:04:10.72 --> 02:04:18.32
going to take my house the same thing. So that is a problem. And Canada, it's just so hard to watch.

1295
02:04:18.32 --> 02:04:24.000
And you got law enforcement guys who just a few years ago or not even two years ago,

1296
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:28.32
they were being defunded and demonized. You know, they're in a whole blind lives matter thing.

1297
02:04:28.32 --> 02:04:35.60
And now these same police officers are ones that are literally trampling on people. And I was like,

1298
02:04:37.92 --> 02:04:42.64
you know, please, hot, don't let it come to that here because I have a lot of law enforcement

1299
02:04:42.64 --> 02:04:49.52
brothers. And we all know that good men follow orders and good men that need to take care of their

1300
02:04:49.52 --> 02:04:54.32
children will follow orders. Good men have to take care of their family and rely on that paycheck.

1301
02:04:54.32 --> 02:04:59.68
They're going to follow orders. That is scary to me because they do that. We'll be at that point

1302
02:04:59.68 --> 02:05:06.24
when I'm like, hey, law dogs, I love you. And I've always supported you, but we are now in two

1303
02:05:06.24 --> 02:05:11.60
different sides. Right? Like when you use like what's happening in Canada, man, they're siding

1304
02:05:11.60 --> 02:05:18.56
with Trado. That little turd, I usually don't, I try not to talk about presidents,

1305
02:05:19.28 --> 02:05:23.20
elected, especially elected presidents of sovereign nations in that kind of

1306
02:05:24.08 --> 02:05:28.32
derogatory term, but wow, you want to talk about some of that warm and knit that he's wrong

1307
02:05:29.60 --> 02:05:36.88
and double down on every step. It's like I just won't lose. And he's got an arsenal. He's got a military.

1308
02:05:36.88 --> 02:05:41.76
He's got a national police force man, a national police force scares the shit out of me dude. I don't

1309
02:05:41.76 --> 02:05:46.72
like it when I see feds wearing multi cam and military stuff, right? Like it makes me uneasy.

1310
02:05:46.72 --> 02:05:52.56
I don't like seeing local PDs wearing B to use. Right? I want to, I like some shy and shoes.

1311
02:05:52.56 --> 02:05:57.60
Like no yellow hat, we patrol still wears a police uniform. They look like police officers,

1312
02:05:57.60 --> 02:06:02.88
not military members. I still don't like it, man. Even I want my law dog friends to have

1313
02:06:02.88 --> 02:06:08.56
every tool available to them to do law enforcement. But there's some things that I definitely

1314
02:06:08.56 --> 02:06:13.28
am not good like no, not warrant, and stuff like that. They're not necessary. And we learn that.

1315
02:06:13.28 --> 02:06:19.36
So if you be as dangerous, let's just not come out. Oh, you don't want to come out.

1316
02:06:19.36 --> 02:06:24.40
I'll okay, cool. Just turn your power off. We'll play some loud music. Maybe send a robot in with

1317
02:06:24.40 --> 02:06:29.84
some gas. You'll come out. You'll get tired of this, right? Yeah, the no knock warrant thing is

1318
02:06:29.84 --> 02:06:34.08
definitely something that needs to stop. Yeah. Our law enforcement needs some help, right?

1319
02:06:34.08 --> 02:06:38.80
Yeah. It really does. Across America, law enforcement in general needs help. The average law

1320
02:06:38.80 --> 02:06:45.36
dog's a good American. Yeah. And even up in Canada, I don't think that that's going to

1321
02:06:45.36 --> 02:06:49.36
continue in this direction. The direction that's going right now, I don't think it's going to continue

1322
02:06:49.36 --> 02:06:54.32
this direction. I think it's going to, yeah, I think it's going to stop. I think the only reason

1323
02:06:54.88 --> 02:06:58.88
that that's is what's going to happen is that the people that are pressing like Trudeau,

1324
02:06:58.88 --> 02:07:05.36
they're actually just a bunch of places. They think they want to fight. But, you know,

1325
02:07:05.36 --> 02:07:11.36
do they really want to fight? Once the bullet start flying and stuff, you know, and things get

1326
02:07:11.36 --> 02:07:15.28
pressed, I think ultimately we're going to see Trudeau step down. I just looked at my

1327
02:07:16.08 --> 02:07:22.08
watch to recognize the date. So it's the 21st of February when we're recording this right now.

1328
02:07:22.08 --> 02:07:27.52
So be interesting. Be interesting to see how it all washes out. I hope that's what I'm going to

1329
02:07:27.52 --> 02:07:30.96
do not want to see Canadian shooting Canadians. No more than I want to see American

1330
02:07:30.96 --> 02:07:36.24
shoot Americans. You know, do you even like, you know, Americans are still mad about the whole

1331
02:07:36.24 --> 02:07:40.32
riots and the black live matter stuff. And rightfully so, because it was all perpetuated and

1332
02:07:40.32 --> 02:07:46.56
funded, you know, black lives matter. Those folks on the streets, riding, they were ponds of

1333
02:07:46.56 --> 02:07:51.60
rich people. And that's that's sad, right? Because sometimes I feel like we've been a little bit

1334
02:07:51.60 --> 02:08:02.96
appalled out in the war. So I can kind of relate. I'm not mad at young black or young Hispanic,

1335
02:08:02.96 --> 02:08:09.68
or whatever group or even even young antifa, you know, white kids who are riding and breaking

1336
02:08:09.68 --> 02:08:16.16
stuff. They're pissed. Are they going too far? Absolutely, right? We have the right to protest

1337
02:08:16.16 --> 02:08:20.96
peacefully, but not break shit and so on and on fire. That's wrong. That's riding, not protesting.

1338
02:08:22.64 --> 02:08:28.24
But again, root cause. That whole mess was perpetuated. It was funded. I mean, it

1339
02:08:28.24 --> 02:08:35.20
would palates a bricks that just poof showed up and, you know, what's the root cause? It's the root

1340
02:08:35.20 --> 02:08:42.40
cause, man. What's really going on? How do we reach out to even more so, you know, like our

1341
02:08:42.40 --> 02:08:47.28
poor communities, poor inner city communities, which oftentimes are predominantly black, but also

1342
02:08:47.28 --> 02:08:54.32
Latino, your poor white communities tend to be rural, right? Well, why are these things happening?

1343
02:08:54.32 --> 02:09:01.28
What is the perpetual process that keeps these communities in their situation? Well,

1344
02:09:02.64 --> 02:09:07.52
modern welfare system, and I don't mean the good kind of welfare, like wellness society. I'm talking

1345
02:09:07.52 --> 02:09:16.56
about our the EBT and all these things. There's no, there's no, it doesn't help people get out of

1346
02:09:16.56 --> 02:09:23.12
those situations and perpetuates it. It destroys the nuclear family. And it was, you know, we can

1347
02:09:23.12 --> 02:09:28.32
go back to LBJ, you know, with the modern welfare programs. There's plenty of quotes out there

1348
02:09:28.32 --> 02:09:32.80
that they did it on purpose. They knew what they actually planned that stuff, right? Like,

1349
02:09:32.80 --> 02:09:36.24
I think back in the 50s and 60s, the intelligence agency in our government, they were a

1350
02:09:36.24 --> 02:09:40.88
pretty sinister and they were thoughtful. They weren't just meandering, right? And you can go back and

1351
02:09:40.88 --> 02:09:47.68
look at what they did and how they approached it and then it bansed on, saying Nixon, that whole bunch

1352
02:09:47.68 --> 02:09:54.40
that were raised out of World War II in a fear of socialism and communism. You know,

1353
02:09:55.12 --> 02:10:03.04
that FBI hovers FBI, that CIA, you know, I mean, man, it was, they were proficient. I feel like they

1354
02:10:03.04 --> 02:10:08.48
knew what they were doing. And so they created that welfare problem. And here we are today,

1355
02:10:08.48 --> 02:10:13.76
no one's ever really came up with any decent solutions. The only real welfare reform our nation has

1356
02:10:13.76 --> 02:10:21.44
ever seen, actually came from Clinton. He actually proposed some things that would help the inner

1357
02:10:21.44 --> 02:10:30.96
city become more productive in valve citizens. And then all that expired and no one's done anything

1358
02:10:30.96 --> 02:10:40.24
since. And I think it's funny, you know, you got the Democrats who manipulate and coerce those communities

1359
02:10:40.24 --> 02:10:44.56
for votes. And you got Republicans who were just like, it's not even worth it to talk to them,

1360
02:10:44.56 --> 02:10:53.68
they're just going to vote Democrat. Oh my. Recruitment 101 folks, you've got young angry people,

1361
02:10:53.68 --> 02:11:00.72
the systems not working for, let's go talk to them. Let's come up with a real welfare reform.

1362
02:11:00.72 --> 02:11:06.48
How do you, you, proves, that's another one, right? Just cut off welfare, tell them to get jobs.

1363
02:11:07.44 --> 02:11:13.04
That's the average white man in America's where you can answer to welfare and poor

1364
02:11:13.04 --> 02:11:18.80
inner city problems. Just cut it off, tell them to get jobs. Yeah, okay, we're talking about

1365
02:11:18.80 --> 02:11:25.92
decades and generations. Cultural change. We have cultures that are based around this problem.

1366
02:11:26.80 --> 02:11:30.96
You think you can just turn off welfare and just tell them to get jobs, there's your answer. That's it.

1367
02:11:31.84 --> 02:11:39.76
Okay, and then what? Okay, and then what? I had an awesome, I met a fellow who's running for

1368
02:11:40.40 --> 02:11:47.44
Fayetteville's mayor. Fayetteville for Brad, you know, going on. And I never thought about it

1369
02:11:47.44 --> 02:11:52.40
this like this and I have only had a few days to even think about it. But his proposal was this and this

1370
02:11:52.40 --> 02:12:00.72
guy is an immigrant. He's Puerto Rican, which, you know, part of the states but not a state.

1371
02:12:00.72 --> 02:12:09.20
So still an immigrant. Raise poor nine brothers and sisters, poor family. Anyway, he said,

1372
02:12:09.20 --> 02:12:16.64
hey man, what is? Let's say you've got a mother, a single mother with four children.

1373
02:12:18.64 --> 02:12:23.20
All right, and some people would say, well, she just keeps having more children to get more welfare.

1374
02:12:23.92 --> 02:12:27.36
Okay, maybe that's true in some situations. I don't think that's true across the board.

1375
02:12:27.92 --> 02:12:30.40
I think in a lot of cases, these mothers have more and more children.

1376
02:12:32.80 --> 02:12:38.16
Maybe they don't have access to birth control. Maybe they're not super educated on on just on

1377
02:12:38.16 --> 02:12:43.68
sex education in general, right? Whatever that problem is, we have this person, their reality.

1378
02:12:43.68 --> 02:12:49.28
Right? They exist. This family of the single mother with these four children, it exists. They exist.

1379
02:12:50.08 --> 02:12:53.76
How do we help them? How we fix them? How do we get those four children to grow up to become

1380
02:12:54.16 --> 02:12:59.84
productive, involved, US citizens? That's the question. What his answer was this. I

1381
02:12:59.84 --> 02:13:08.08
say she's getting $1,400 a month from all the different programs total. That's about what she's

1382
02:13:08.08 --> 02:13:17.68
getting. 1,400. It's poverty, bro. But if she gets a job, she loses all of it. She gets a job that

1383
02:13:17.68 --> 02:13:25.20
only pays her $1,000. Now she would be at $2,400 a month. Now she's just barely getting by still.

1384
02:13:25.20 --> 02:13:31.76
She's still in the poverty. But the second, she takes a legal dollar or something. It's not under the table.

1385
02:13:31.76 --> 02:13:38.32
She loses every cent of her welfare funding. How does that incentivize her or her children to

1386
02:13:38.32 --> 02:13:45.12
go do some? So he was his plan and I was like, huh? He said, let's lower it.

1387
02:13:46.32 --> 02:13:51.44
Let's take some welfare away. I wasn't expecting you to say that. Here's how he said he said,

1388
02:13:51.44 --> 02:13:57.76
okay, let's knock it down. Let's cut that that $1,400 to $600. She doesn't get a job. She gets $600.

1389
02:13:59.04 --> 02:14:07.84
She gets a job and maybe she makes $500 a week. She gets an additional $100 a week from welfare.

1390
02:14:08.56 --> 02:14:14.40
So she makes more. She actually starts getting more. So let's say she goes from that $1,400. Now she's

1391
02:14:14.40 --> 02:14:22.56
making $2,000 in addition to her own. She's making $2,000 a month at her job. She's going from that.

1392
02:14:22.56 --> 02:14:29.36
$500 or whatever initial instead of the $1400. Now she's at $1,000. Well there's a certain

1393
02:14:29.36 --> 02:14:34.000
point in which she makes enough money to actually pay for her own welfare on tax dollars.

1394
02:14:35.28 --> 02:14:43.20
Now pays for itself. The incentive is for that lady that you don't want them to go work harder

1395
02:14:43.20 --> 02:14:48.72
to make money and now she will actually pay for her own welfare. It's a zero-sum game for American

1396
02:14:48.72 --> 02:14:55.28
taxpayers. And I was like, oh, we should have never had that before. Never thought about it like that before.

1397
02:14:55.84 --> 02:15:00.08
I always thought about it like the more you make the less you get from welfare.

1398
02:15:00.08 --> 02:15:04.40
Like if you're making $1400 welfare and now you're making $2,000, you're only going to get $7.

1399
02:15:04.40 --> 02:15:09.04
He's like, no, no. It's copped, right? It's not like she just keeps making. Now she's making $200,000

1400
02:15:09.04 --> 02:15:14.08
years. She goes $50,000 in welfare, right? No, it's copped. There's a point in which it all goes away.

1401
02:15:15.28 --> 02:15:19.60
And he even said he goes, now maybe there's actually a pyramid where it goes up no

1402
02:15:19.60 --> 02:15:23.68
certain amount and as she continues to write more, it goes down in a little bit and then it's

1403
02:15:23.68 --> 02:15:27.84
ended but it's all based off of and he's like it would take a lot of work.

1404
02:15:29.52 --> 02:15:32.48
Because everywhere in the nation the cost of living is different.

1405
02:15:32.48 --> 02:15:40.72
So you'd have to build it around all of that. He's like, but it would work and it would fix the whole

1406
02:15:41.36 --> 02:15:46.56
problem. He's like you would be addressing the animosity and the resentment that taxed

1407
02:15:46.56 --> 02:15:52.64
paying hard work in Americans having its welfare recipients. That stigma, right? That whole

1408
02:15:52.64 --> 02:15:58.40
just can't smell fair type. Well now the welfare recipient is paying for its own welfare

1409
02:15:58.40 --> 02:16:03.68
for their own welfare. Not it's, right? That's the humanizing. I mean you do that. But that person is

1410
02:16:03.68 --> 02:16:09.28
now paying for their own welfare. I was like wow. But I'm like you can't be the only person.

1411
02:16:09.28 --> 02:16:14.80
You know, this, you know, put a reek in American that's running for mayor in a family.

1412
02:16:14.80 --> 02:16:18.56
You mean you can tell me that only person is ever thought of this? And probably not. He's just

1413
02:16:18.56 --> 02:16:22.56
the only person that ever told me about it. And I was like, I've just never thought of that. Right?

1414
02:16:22.56 --> 02:16:27.92
It's never been in my entire life. Have I ever, I've never had to sit down and start thinking

1415
02:16:27.92 --> 02:16:34.48
about viable ways to in the welfare state in America? It's not been a problem that I had to address

1416
02:16:34.48 --> 02:16:40.88
in my military career or my small business, right? You know, not a problem. So now that I'm

1417
02:16:41.44 --> 02:16:45.44
running for a house of representatives, it is something that I got to start looking at and I was

1418
02:16:45.44 --> 02:16:51.20
blown away. So again, back to my point of the problems are never too close to equals four.

1419
02:16:52.24 --> 02:16:56.64
I'll say I think that easy. No, it's never that easy. And when we, when we have that conversation

1420
02:16:56.64 --> 02:17:01.84
we sit back and say, hey man, you know, this isn't working. We need to adjust. Just like

1421
02:17:01.84 --> 02:17:07.52
man, if we're in route to a target, you briefed your puttune, right? I believe my, you know,

1422
02:17:07.52 --> 02:17:15.60
troop and ISR reports back, ooh, no, there's not 15 mo foes on this target. Man, there

1423
02:17:15.60 --> 02:17:21.52
are having some type of get together. There's 40 mall dunes on this target, you know, and trucks.

1424
02:17:21.52 --> 02:17:26.000
And what appears to be some PKMs in those trucks, we thought it's going to be easy target on

1425
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.52
it off, right? Nice little fun Tuesday night. I saw this report in something different. Do we go,

1426
02:17:32.72 --> 02:17:37.84
yeah, Roger that, click, and hang up. We're not talking about anyone. I'm not even going to brief

1427
02:17:37.84 --> 02:17:43.52
my, my troopers. No, we probably come to a little tactical haul, huddle up. Unless discussed this

1428
02:17:43.52 --> 02:17:49.04
at the key leaders are going to sit down and chat, right? Is this a salt force even able to take

1429
02:17:49.04 --> 02:17:54.000
that target? Well, probably not. Okay, well, let's head back to the house. We made a mistake,

1430
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.08
right? Based off an information out, we didn't make a mistake. Based off an information,

1431
02:17:58.08 --> 02:18:06.000
as it changed, let's just hit pause, you know, or maybe we request more air. If we

1432
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.48
person's going up and we don't hit the target, we let the air force do it for us, or the navy,

1433
02:18:10.48 --> 02:18:16.24
or the Marines, or whoever's flying for us that night, you know? It's so frustrating, man,

1434
02:18:16.24 --> 02:18:22.88
because it's like, you know, there's, there's eight SF guys running for for US House

1435
02:18:22.88 --> 02:18:31.60
representative. There's seven seals. And like I said, 25, 30 global long terrorism, veterans.

1436
02:18:32.88 --> 02:18:37.12
You know, somebody asked me another day, well, what sets you apart from these other candidates?

1437
02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.80
We're all concerned, it is. We all pretty much agree on how to, you know, the, we all have the same

1438
02:18:42.80 --> 02:18:49.20
stances on everything. The difference between the first difference between me and some of my

1439
02:18:49.20 --> 02:18:55.28
opponents is spine and shoulders. Right? And I don't mean that in bad way. Like, I mean it

1440
02:18:55.28 --> 02:18:58.000
and like, because they're good people, right? The folks I'm running against,

1441
02:18:59.76 --> 02:19:05.60
Sands probably one of them are good people, good people who really want to go change. And if you

1442
02:19:05.60 --> 02:19:11.20
ask them, they're going to capital Hill and they're going to save the planet. Here's reality.

1443
02:19:11.20 --> 02:19:17.76
Reality is a freshman brand new representative in Congress has zero influence and no friends.

1444
02:19:17.76 --> 02:19:22.96
Labius don't even knock on their office door. They got a little cubby hole in office over in that

1445
02:19:22.96 --> 02:19:31.84
other building. There are nobody's. So they look for friends. They make friends with lobbyists and

1446
02:19:31.84 --> 02:19:40.48
other little groups and caucuses, right? And the incumbents, the 345, 20 term representatives,

1447
02:19:41.20 --> 02:19:47.60
they recruit them. They do them favors. Now we got clicks and this is politics and this

1448
02:19:47.60 --> 02:19:54.24
is the grossness of it. Here's what aside from me not being willing to compromise, right?

1449
02:19:54.24 --> 02:19:58.72
I've said straight up, four terms. If America or North Carolina have district 13,

1450
02:19:58.72 --> 02:20:04.32
through whatever, whichever district I want to run in four terms is all I will do. Period.

1451
02:20:04.32 --> 02:20:08.40
We need terminus. Whether or not we can get that pushed through or not if when I'm up there,

1452
02:20:09.04 --> 02:20:13.20
different story I'm still not going to. I'm a self imposed my own term. I don't want to work

1453
02:20:13.20 --> 02:20:23.60
in DC. One of my opponents recently told me I was a ignorant wannabe. I was like,

1454
02:20:24.56 --> 02:20:28.48
except for the differences. I was like, you're absolutely right. I am pretty ignorant to it.

1455
02:20:28.48 --> 02:20:35.36
Exactly the kind of bullshit you guys are doing in politics. But you're wrong about the wannabe

1456
02:20:35.36 --> 02:20:41.36
part. I'm not a wannabe. I don't want to run for Congress, but because of people like him,

1457
02:20:41.36 --> 02:20:48.80
American needs us to run. Well, I'm not willing to compromise. That's the biggest thing.

1458
02:20:48.80 --> 02:20:53.20
I'm not, you know, I say this all the time. I'm not even mad at Democrats.

1459
02:20:54.40 --> 02:20:58.16
I'm pissed off at Republicans who have compromised our rights away.

1460
02:20:59.84 --> 02:21:05.04
They keep thinking somehow that they can negotiate or not even negotiate because I'll clarify

1461
02:21:05.04 --> 02:21:09.68
the difference between negotiate and compromise. They keep compromising with the left and the

1462
02:21:09.68 --> 02:21:13.52
Democrats thinking they're all going to get along and come to some time of agreement.

1463
02:21:13.52 --> 02:21:19.04
Democrats just keep taking that shit, putting it out back, pulling it up. We got some more from them.

1464
02:21:19.04 --> 02:21:22.48
We got some more from them. Republicans go, well, if we keep playing nice with them,

1465
02:21:23.76 --> 02:21:28.40
maybe one day they'll be our friends. No, man, the Democrats are hellbent on creating a

1466
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:34.72
communist regime in this country. I mean, they don't care what you think. They don't want to be your

1467
02:21:34.72 --> 02:21:40.16
friend. They want to get rid of you. They want to replace you. And we see this playing out in this whole

1468
02:21:40.16 --> 02:21:43.92
politics right now. All of a sudden, you keep saying everything like what's the, what's the,

1469
02:21:43.92 --> 02:21:49.52
what's the cure for COVID midterm elections? All of a sudden the mandate, the science says, no,

1470
02:21:49.52 --> 02:21:55.92
bullshit. And for you know, there's no, there's no, the COVID numbers haven't changed at all. The

1471
02:21:55.92 --> 02:22:01.52
science hasn't changed at all. Midterms are coming in Democrats know they're about to lose and the

1472
02:22:01.52 --> 02:22:05.52
across the country through boards of elections and every different means they can. They're trying to

1473
02:22:05.52 --> 02:22:10.16
protect their what they have left. And we see it in North Carolina with the redistricting and all this

1474
02:22:10.16 --> 02:22:18.56
nastiness. But anyway, the number two thing that sets me in part is that group of veterans,

1475
02:22:18.56 --> 02:22:24.16
those green braids, those seals when we show up. Let's say half of us, right? Let's say there's

1476
02:22:24.16 --> 02:22:31.52
30, it's just over 30, global entourage, I'm better and young, vibrant, not old gray hair, crippled old

1477
02:22:31.52 --> 02:22:40.16
man, easy on the gray hair, bro. You're not old, you're still vibrant, you know, there's, uh,

1478
02:22:40.56 --> 02:22:45.76
I keep looking at how I does, right? We're still young if most of the 20 year old troopers,

1479
02:22:45.76 --> 02:22:51.20
the 20 to 30 year old troopers and the teams are on the ODAs. Don't want to fistfight.

1480
02:22:51.20 --> 02:22:58.16
The second they know that we're not able to, you know, hold our own, then we're that old line

1481
02:22:58.16 --> 02:23:04.000
and it gets pushed out of the right. You know, but I would say right now the average 20 to 30 year

1482
02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.88
old soft trooper doesn't really want to throw down with you. One of them, right? I mean,

1483
02:23:08.88 --> 02:23:12.16
some of them wouldn't they probably will parole us? There's we're going to be somewhere the next

1484
02:23:12.16 --> 02:23:18.32
day no matter what. But the difference is they know we got this old knowing where either highly

1485
02:23:18.32 --> 02:23:24.96
aggressive, violent and smart, right? Like you don't get through 20 some years of war just being

1486
02:23:24.96 --> 02:23:28.96
lucky, you know. And I always tell them that, you know, I'm still in 20th group, man, I teach

1487
02:23:28.96 --> 02:23:32.32
down on our subfowse course and I'll pick on the young and it's not gonna be like, okay, whatever man,

1488
02:23:32.32 --> 02:23:36.64
you know, that that fun, you know, shooting a shit, talking whatever you want to call it and I'm like,

1489
02:23:36.64 --> 02:23:43.52
okay, whatever man you want to fistfight? On the outside, I look like I'm ready, you know,

1490
02:23:43.92 --> 02:23:47.20
ready to get after it. On the inside of my please look, God don't let his stay fixed by.

1491
02:23:47.20 --> 02:23:52.96
Don't let this get fixed. I actually want to take the upper this offer because it's going to hurt so bad.

1492
02:23:54.56 --> 02:24:03.92
But yeah, man, could you imagine 20 global war on terrorism veterans, right? 12 of them,

1493
02:24:03.92 --> 02:24:10.72
special operations guys. Swine oath for a second time on Capitol Hill,

1494
02:24:10.72 --> 02:24:17.44
the Democrats shaking in their boots because they know they just lost and the Republicans going,

1495
02:24:19.68 --> 02:24:22.88
we're gonna have to ask those guys, those newbies, these freshmens,

1496
02:24:24.24 --> 02:24:28.48
we're gonna have to really team up with these guys and work with them.

1497
02:24:30.48 --> 02:24:36.64
That's some stuff that could change America's trajectory. And that's the difference in between me

1498
02:24:36.64 --> 02:24:42.16
and some of my really good opponents, good people, right? I got, I got guys running a district against

1499
02:24:42.16 --> 02:24:46.64
me, man, he's a good old boy, good old country boy, we talk after meeting, we hit it off and I was like,

1500
02:24:46.64 --> 02:24:51.68
man, in any other time you and I met, we just be hunting fish and buddies. He's a good Carolina boy.

1501
02:24:53.20 --> 02:24:58.16
And I told him, I was like, hey, man, tell you what, don't you just let me and my buddies go up there

1502
02:24:58.16 --> 02:25:02.72
for a couple of years, I told you I'm out. I just is not a career for me. I'll do everything in a

1503
02:25:02.72 --> 02:25:09.92
world to help you run after I'm done. Of course he didn't take me up on that off. He's so convincing

1504
02:25:09.92 --> 02:25:15.68
and big me. And maybe you can, but that's the cool thing about democracy, right? I have to show the

1505
02:25:15.68 --> 02:25:21.52
people in this district that I'm the best candidate. I can't just say I am, I have to go show them.

1506
02:25:21.52 --> 02:25:30.08
And so anyway, man, it's so, so interesting stuff, not so much. It's like so simple, but it's not easy.

1507
02:25:35.36 --> 02:25:43.28
So, little side track right there, you get, you get done with Afghanistan, you go do some

1508
02:25:43.28 --> 02:25:53.36
stuff, work with law enforcement, whatnot, and then when do you end up going to Iraq? Just before

1509
02:25:53.36 --> 02:26:03.20
the invasion. And so Iraq happens, all that goes down on up north and made more friends, more

1510
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:08.80
Kurd friends, more friends over at the agency, and because we were basically doing that events prep

1511
02:26:08.80 --> 02:26:14.16
for Northern Iraq with the Kurds and everything. So you got there before the invasion and you're

1512
02:26:14.16 --> 02:26:20.80
up with the Kurds and you're prepping for what's going on? The war's coming, right? Yeah, so, you know,

1513
02:26:20.80 --> 02:26:26.88
a vision goes down, freaking, I was running around like Mozzle, Kirkuk, to create all that stuff.

1514
02:26:29.60 --> 02:26:35.76
Are you with those, ODI 18? I'm actually one of the, one of the SAT teams, okay. Because I'm

1515
02:26:35.76 --> 02:26:46.32
that young kid that doesn't like an SFGAT, right? So, really cool. Yeah, Iraq happens and then,

1516
02:26:46.72 --> 02:26:54.08
in my next trip to Afghanistan, I got bumped off a cliff, I broke my back. How to get bumped off a cliff?

1517
02:26:55.84 --> 02:27:01.92
One of our partners tripped, we were walking down, he was above me, he tripped,

1518
02:27:01.92 --> 02:27:13.84
80, 90 pound backpack, nice, you know, freaking offset and feel. How far were, how long were the

1519
02:27:13.84 --> 02:27:21.36
cliff? Probably fell 15 feet, enough to, you know, basically when he hit me, you know, I kind of like

1520
02:27:21.36 --> 02:27:25.68
feet went out and landed basically on my ass, like my feet were kind of out in front of me,

1521
02:27:25.68 --> 02:27:34.88
little outcropping and it, that rock side just, just split my, L5, how much did you weigh at this point?

1522
02:27:35.92 --> 02:27:39.36
You jacked it, because you cut it. I'm trying to put on some kick talking about spawning.

1523
02:27:39.36 --> 02:27:44.16
Yeah, you cut it. Now we're, you know, three years into the, into the war, four years into the

1524
02:27:44.16 --> 02:27:48.56
war, man, I've been hitting a weight pile like everybody else, I'm probably like a buck 85 and

1525
02:27:48.56 --> 02:27:54.80
yeah, man, it just bent me over, split my vertebrae, part of the very rate hit my spinal cord,

1526
02:27:55.92 --> 02:28:02.08
the prognosis was you might walk with crutches one day. So when you like paralyzed on site,

1527
02:28:02.08 --> 02:28:07.04
bro, that hole, I can't feel my legs, yeah, I didn't experience that, because I could feel it

1528
02:28:07.04 --> 02:28:13.52
and it hurt like hell. Right, if you took this dude, put it in a fire, got it nice and orange,

1529
02:28:13.52 --> 02:28:18.96
and stuck it in the side of my spine back here, that's what it felt like all the way to my toes.

1530
02:28:20.08 --> 02:28:23.76
It was, it was like I was on fire. Did they cast it back you? Oh yeah,

1531
02:28:25.76 --> 02:28:32.08
spent three or four months in a brace doing a little chair thing, freaking got better,

1532
02:28:33.68 --> 02:28:39.52
really fast. So within a year, I'm running again. Well, my ETS date came up and I had a flight pack

1533
02:28:39.52 --> 02:28:45.68
in. What if there'd be a pilot? I thought, you know, my ground pound in days was,

1534
02:28:45.68 --> 02:28:49.52
I had already done everything we could, right? How many more countries are we in VAT?

1535
02:28:49.52 --> 02:28:54.40
Yeah, I thought my ground pound in days was over and these are patchy gunships keep flying in

1536
02:28:54.40 --> 02:29:00.56
and just doing all our work. I'm like, I'm a good bear. Yeah, they got like, they could only

1537
02:29:00.56 --> 02:29:05.28
work a few hours a day in my, man, these these one officers, they can fly for the rest of their

1538
02:29:05.28 --> 02:29:10.56
lives, you know, because the Army has a worn-off's their program. I don't know. So I put it on

1539
02:29:10.56 --> 02:29:14.80
packet. All I had to do was get home and go to flight school. It's going to be awesome.

1540
02:29:15.60 --> 02:29:19.68
Well, that clearly changed. I thought my career was over. So luckily, those friends that

1541
02:29:19.68 --> 02:29:24.32
had made it to agency, I got out and I initially took it to get medically retired or,

1542
02:29:26.08 --> 02:29:31.44
young and dumb man, my intent. I thought I was going to go contract for a little while, get

1543
02:29:31.44 --> 02:29:36.72
better and then I would come back in the Army and flop. Just take some time off and there's

1544
02:29:36.72 --> 02:29:40.64
all these awesome contracting jobs out there, paying awesome. Oh, nice. These kids, you're the

1545
02:29:40.64 --> 02:29:45.44
national guard so you could say, hey, I'm non-deployable for a while. I'm going to see you love,

1546
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.08
but you'd still be in the national guard. But I got a contract. I got a completely, you got

1547
02:29:50.08 --> 02:29:55.44
our completely. Yep, you call them. Because at this point, the guard has figured out that they're

1548
02:29:55.44 --> 02:30:00.56
just imaging dudes to contracting. So you got all these batangins commanders. What year,

1549
02:30:00.56 --> 02:30:06.96
you're coming? So, O405. Oh, yeah. This is like 1500 bucks a day for contracting stuff.

1550
02:30:06.96 --> 02:30:10.56
Shutting it down and they're like, nope, you still got to be at your drills. You still got to

1551
02:30:10.56 --> 02:30:15.44
meet your commitments. Whereas in like, oh, 203, you had company commanders jumping in and

1552
02:30:15.44 --> 02:30:19.36
they were like, yeah, I don't care if y'all show up or not. And if you think about it, right? Like,

1553
02:30:19.36 --> 02:30:25.20
you've got your troopers overseas doing, you know, at least combat isch type stuff, you know,

1554
02:30:25.20 --> 02:30:32.08
it was a good thing for the guard. You had guard guys that were getting exponentially more combat

1555
02:30:32.08 --> 02:30:37.52
experienced through contracting than the active duty groups were doing because they were just rotating,

1556
02:30:37.52 --> 02:30:42.000
you know? So it was a good thing for the guard, but it wasn't good for their numbers, right?

1557
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.80
They looked good. They, that guys that weren't getting their online training done, you know?

1558
02:30:46.80 --> 02:30:51.76
Right. Like, you got to do your E.O.s your sharp strength, right? It was killing those numbers

1559
02:30:51.76 --> 02:30:57.44
for these commanders. So they shut it down. So I was like, screw it, I'm out. I'll just come back in.

1560
02:30:57.44 --> 02:31:01.20
You know, I'll go make some money, whatever, by a house or something, which is, you know,

1561
02:31:01.20 --> 02:31:07.92
it was exactly what I did, but as I got better, you know, I went, became operational again.

1562
02:31:07.92 --> 02:31:12.56
And so to doing cool stuff, way cooler than the army, ever was going to let me do.

1563
02:31:13.12 --> 02:31:18.16
This is as a contract. Yeah. So I never went back in or I didn't go back into fly.

1564
02:31:18.16 --> 02:31:24.16
Um, and at one point it was kind of funny because I did go back in and join 20th group,

1565
02:31:24.16 --> 02:31:29.44
uh, like 2012, which I'm still in. How long was it? But that's a pretty big gap though.

1566
02:31:29.44 --> 02:31:33.28
Yeah, like seven on the state years. Seven eight years. And were you contract in a whole

1567
02:31:33.28 --> 02:31:38.96
time? Hold on. On stop. I stayed really busy with that. Of course, I started the gym. I would come home.

1568
02:31:38.96 --> 02:31:43.20
I got lucky, man. You know, teamwork, right? It makes a dream work when I started my gym,

1569
02:31:43.20 --> 02:31:50.16
which I opened it in January of 2008. That's when this gym opened. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool.

1570
02:31:51.36 --> 02:31:58.08
You know, 2008 I was going nine months. I opened a gym, luckily the team that I put in place,

1571
02:31:58.08 --> 02:32:03.12
ran it like it was their own. They did an amazing job. Amazing job. Good friend of my

1572
02:32:03.12 --> 02:32:09.12
Darren Canclerman. He just did it. The young lady I was dating at the time, Julie. They ran the

1573
02:32:09.12 --> 02:32:14.56
damn thing. And so I could come home and be the war hero that showed up, the run the gym,

1574
02:32:14.56 --> 02:32:18.48
and take over for a minute, and ruin their lives. You know, they had a plan to make a good

1575
02:32:18.48 --> 02:32:22.48
thing. Nope. I'm doing it my way. You know, like, no, hopefully I wouldn't like that. But,

1576
02:32:22.48 --> 02:32:27.04
you know, intrinsically, that'll happen. But they just didn't awesome job with my gym.

1577
02:32:27.60 --> 02:32:34.64
And I could, I could stay deployed. And I did. And the gym grew. So that was cool. It was kind of a

1578
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:40.40
parallel there. And the gym was great. You know, it was supposed to be just a little cross fit gym

1579
02:32:40.40 --> 02:32:45.20
that, you know, guys like us, marine recomboys and Marciac dudes, because we're just south of

1580
02:32:45.20 --> 02:32:49.44
the gym coming there, take their shirts off spit on the floor, throw up if they want to.

1581
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.92
And we'll just thrash ourselves. And then regular people started showing up. Right? Like soccer

1582
02:32:55.92 --> 02:33:01.28
moms and stuff. And you know, I'm still at this point in my life. I'm like, hey, you, you know,

1583
02:33:01.28 --> 02:33:07.44
you, you stop being a pus and, you know, maybe stop being so many donuts fat so. And you could

1584
02:33:07.44 --> 02:33:15.92
tag on be a PT stud too. Well, when 33 year old, 36 year old mother of two or three that

1585
02:33:15.92 --> 02:33:21.28
drives a suburban pulls up, you can't talk to her like that because she won't come back.

1586
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:25.20
And those are also the people that have the money to pay their gym for their shifts.

1587
02:33:25.20 --> 02:33:30.08
Those colleagues kids that are studs that you want to train, they ain't got no money.

1588
02:33:30.08 --> 02:33:36.64
You know, you got to at least pay the light bill. So I quickly figured out how to talk

1589
02:33:36.64 --> 02:33:41.44
to regular people. You know, you can't be like, hey, Sally, maybe cut out that bottle of wine

1590
02:33:41.44 --> 02:33:44.32
and that box of donuts every night. You might be able to do a pull-up.

1591
02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.80
Yeah, she's never got a pull-up. She was looking for her. So now you had, you know, I had to,

1592
02:33:50.80 --> 02:33:56.40
I was real adamant about not being that creepy gem owner. And you know, who was like, you know,

1593
02:33:56.40 --> 02:34:00.000
have any type of fratinization of clients and stuff like that? I was a big deal.

1594
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.44
And I did start that gem with a partner and it quickly figured out it wasn't going to work.

1595
02:34:04.16 --> 02:34:06.88
Not a bad separation or just like he couldn't move to women.

1596
02:34:07.84 --> 02:34:11.68
And yeah, man, it was that gem taught me a lot about teaching,

1597
02:34:12.72 --> 02:34:16.80
you know, just how to talk to people. You couldn't, hey, Ranger, you know,

1598
02:34:18.16 --> 02:34:22.88
hey, Sally, come here. What's going on? You know, you, you, um, hey, when you're ready,

1599
02:34:22.88 --> 02:34:26.88
if you like, um, let's sit down and you know, maybe line out some nutrition, a diet,

1600
02:34:26.88 --> 02:34:30.48
it's enough. You know, nutrition, not diet, right? Those words mean something because if you say something

1601
02:34:30.48 --> 02:34:36.16
to a lady who needs to drop 20 pounds, you know, if you say, let's talk about getting you on a diet.

1602
02:34:36.16 --> 02:34:40.64
Oh, my God. Oh, you just, she's gone. She hates your guts. But if you're like, hey, look,

1603
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:44.72
let's tune this up. You know, man, your shoulders are starting to get really defined. You know,

1604
02:34:44.72 --> 02:34:48.80
you're looking great. And that was a cool thing about CrossFit, right? Is that women's upper body

1605
02:34:48.80 --> 02:34:55.44
started to develop? And, you know, you clearly can't be that creep and talk to her about her legs

1606
02:34:55.44 --> 02:35:01.12
or any other, you know, lady parts or whatever. You know, you can't be, hey, Sally, you know,

1607
02:35:01.12 --> 02:35:04.96
your, your mom's looking great. You know, that's, that's inappropriate, right? It's not professional.

1608
02:35:05.84 --> 02:35:10.80
And so, you know, I really learned how to, to talk to people and then motivate them and

1609
02:35:10.80 --> 02:35:15.20
bring them into the fold. And you know, before we know it, that was one thing my gym was so well

1610
02:35:15.20 --> 02:35:22.64
known for, I'm so proud of it is that our women monsters and people would come to me like other

1611
02:35:22.64 --> 02:35:31.12
gym owners and stuff like, what are you doing to motivate and turn these women into these monsters?

1612
02:35:31.12 --> 02:35:36.32
Right? We sent like, I don't know, um, 18 different athletes through the CrossFit games.

1613
02:35:36.96 --> 02:35:44.40
Out of a town of only 150,000 people, very good. And it was just, I didn't even have to recruit

1614
02:35:44.40 --> 02:35:48.88
once it started. We had one of the original super strong females. She just showed up. She was a

1615
02:35:48.88 --> 02:35:54.40
volleyball player, powerful, right? She could very coordinated that touch, in only lifting before

1616
02:35:54.40 --> 02:35:58.40
you know that she was like throwing weight overhead at most of the dudes in the gym couldn't touch.

1617
02:35:59.28 --> 02:36:05.28
And so people started hearing about her and then it grew and then her and then a handful of others

1618
02:36:05.28 --> 02:36:10.88
and next thing you know, I've got these, I'm looking for dudes. Our thing was the team events.

1619
02:36:10.88 --> 02:36:14.72
I love the team events. I don't know. The individuals is cool, right? And the whole different

1620
02:36:14.72 --> 02:36:20.000
level, but the team was fun and I'm all about building a team. So our teams did really well,

1621
02:36:20.80 --> 02:36:25.44
but there were years where, you know, a couple years where we didn't, the team didn't go to the

1622
02:36:25.44 --> 02:36:31.76
games because the guys on my team weren't strong enough to get us on the podium at regionals.

1623
02:36:31.76 --> 02:36:38.72
It was never the girls, man. I trained one young lady. She came in the gym of, of Fino,

1624
02:36:38.72 --> 02:36:44.64
right? Like just this diamond in a rough fast twitch, powerful. She had been a soccer player,

1625
02:36:44.64 --> 02:36:51.68
a swimmer at ECU. You got pleasure. Hard. She just imagined the most hard-headed

1626
02:36:51.68 --> 02:36:55.84
Ranger young, still pump you ever dealt with. This was her, man. But like the first time she

1627
02:36:55.84 --> 02:37:01.04
ever deadlift, she picked up over 300 pounds. I walked in with a stop stop stop. What are you doing? Who

1628
02:37:01.04 --> 02:37:05.84
is she? Why is she picking up that kind of weight? She's clearly new. Right? Horrible for him,

1629
02:37:05.84 --> 02:37:12.32
but just powerful. So anyway, that's a problem. She, she, she could have been an individual athlete.

1630
02:37:12.32 --> 02:37:17.76
She had that type of genetics. She went a different route. That year, I couldn't put her on my team.

1631
02:37:17.76 --> 02:37:21.52
She just wasn't ready yet. She couldn't work with the team. She came in a little late.

1632
02:37:21.52 --> 02:37:26.72
She had everything going for. I was like, hey, in the interim, let's play with strongman.

1633
02:37:27.76 --> 02:37:30.72
Right? We just started getting strongman equipment. It was getting more and more worked

1634
02:37:30.72 --> 02:37:34.48
into the CrossFit stuff. And we kind of did a pure thing. And some of the gym members,

1635
02:37:34.48 --> 02:37:37.52
you know, I was that guy who was, I was like the most anti- CrossFit

1636
02:37:37.52 --> 02:37:41.76
CrossFit gym owner on the planet. I was like CrossFit was supposed to be to get you in shape.

1637
02:37:41.76 --> 02:37:46.40
So you can go do cool stuff. You want to try a triathlon. You want to try, you want to,

1638
02:37:46.40 --> 02:37:51.44
you know, whatever, you know, I never really saw CrossFit as like becoming a sport, but I can

1639
02:37:51.44 --> 02:37:55.60
help, but I like to compete, you know, let's get in it. So anyway, this young lady came really

1640
02:37:55.60 --> 02:38:02.80
long. She, as a hey, let's try strongman. So she did like a local event, crushed it. It's too,

1641
02:38:02.80 --> 02:38:08.88
it's, and still it's super strong. Well, that event qualified her for the worlds at the Arnold's

1642
02:38:08.88 --> 02:38:16.16
name. She weighed 165 pounds naturally. She never touched any drugs. And Stralman has not

1643
02:38:16.16 --> 02:38:21.36
a tested sport, right? So the middle weight class and the females are them is the most competitive.

1644
02:38:21.36 --> 02:38:28.64
And it's a 140, 180 pounds and most of the girls cut from 200. There's, you know, 511, 6 foot tall,

1645
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:36.40
200 pound females. And like I said, not tested. Can we go to the Arnold Brown and Wins World,

1646
02:38:36.40 --> 02:38:41.84
our second strongman competition wins it. She didn't cut. She walked on, walked in the competition

1647
02:38:41.84 --> 02:38:47.36
home 65 pounds. This is what she waited the time. I mean, she's probably five dollars nine,

1648
02:38:47.36 --> 02:38:52.08
five eight and nine, just naturally, well, not naturally. She had been an athlete in college, right?

1649
02:38:52.08 --> 02:38:55.92
But just exploded. And you said she swam and played volleyball? Is that the one?

1650
02:38:55.92 --> 02:39:05.04
And soccer. Okay, just aggressive too. And just like the host. She should, at the time there

1651
02:39:05.04 --> 02:39:11.04
wasn't a good MMA presence in Womington. That's where she should have gone. That's where she

1652
02:39:11.04 --> 02:39:18.56
should have gone. As one of the gyms, Saltre and those guys stood up in an MMA gym there and

1653
02:39:18.56 --> 02:39:23.12
had that been stood up out of center over there. I mean, go kill with people with a little bit of

1654
02:39:23.12 --> 02:39:27.52
training this chick would have been scary, right? She was, and she would go with her and training

1655
02:39:27.52 --> 02:39:31.12
and play and she went to the little phase where she was doing some striking and stuff. And I was just like,

1656
02:39:31.12 --> 02:39:36.72
God, man. Anyway, long story short with her, she kind of got involved in the wrong people and

1657
02:39:36.72 --> 02:39:42.80
stuff and I didn't coach anymore. I'm freaking, but what an amazing Gika. And like I said,

1658
02:39:42.80 --> 02:39:49.36
man, it was just so cool that our females were so well known when like every lady on the team is

1659
02:39:49.36 --> 02:39:56.000
snatching 200 pounds deadlift in three plus. Like Kimberly was deadlift in 500 pounds in a

1660
02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.84
buck 70 and had abs. You know what I mean? She did not look like a powerlifter. And this is just

1661
02:40:01.84 --> 02:40:07.20
the ladies we had. They were just badass. You know Melissa went to the games. She was just the

1662
02:40:07.20 --> 02:40:13.60
small one. She was the bodyweight one. And as CrossFit matured, now the average CrossFit females

1663
02:40:13.60 --> 02:40:18.96
like a buck 65. And those girls are big. So Melissa, she can't compete with them. She can't move

1664
02:40:18.96 --> 02:40:26.56
the weight that they do. But yeah, and Melissa was instrumental in helping, once Melissa realized

1665
02:40:26.56 --> 02:40:31.84
she wasn't big enough because last time we went to the games, you know, Dawn was, you know,

1666
02:40:32.64 --> 02:40:41.60
probably at the time 1665, a girl, man, a 150 pounds, another volleyball player. And Jordan

1667
02:40:42.24 --> 02:40:47.36
probably 150 pounds. And every single one of them were deadlift and 400 pounds, cleaning

1668
02:40:47.36 --> 02:40:52.96
and jerking over two. I mean, these chicks and running subsicks minute miles. Like what

1669
02:40:52.96 --> 02:40:58.40
that? And I mean, you know, luckily that last year the boys were all big boys and studs. But

1670
02:40:58.40 --> 02:41:04.16
Melissa was, you know, an amazing, amazing coach to those ladies. She was just once, you know,

1671
02:41:04.16 --> 02:41:08.64
the deal, once you realize you ain't ever going to be in the ring again, right? Like you can

1672
02:41:08.64 --> 02:41:14.32
either, you know, what is it? Those who can't do teach. And that's just really same for me,

1673
02:41:14.32 --> 02:41:18.32
right? Like as I got older, I was like, I don't stand a chance of being, you know, involved in this

1674
02:41:18.32 --> 02:41:23.12
sport, but I can dance or coach and people to it. But yeah, the gym was amazing, man, freaking,

1675
02:41:23.84 --> 02:41:28.32
it was lucky that I could run it in a parallel. Once me and Melissa started dating, I started,

1676
02:41:28.32 --> 02:41:34.24
I went to her face right into Poirre, whole lot. I'm doing my teaching stuff states, I, and

1677
02:41:34.88 --> 02:41:39.28
I was, how would patrol for an in mind, asked me to start helping him, like teach some firearms.

1678
02:41:39.28 --> 02:41:45.84
His father had a nice range of stuff in my gym, man. Why not? You know, he was going through a

1679
02:41:45.84 --> 02:41:51.52
divorce and needed some money. So I was like, yeah, you know, he's like, yeah, I think, you know,

1680
02:41:51.52 --> 02:41:56.48
with your background, you know, we can, we can bring in some people and that's how the whole

1681
02:41:57.12 --> 02:42:01.52
shooting part of my business kind of started was just trying to help a buddy that needed some,

1682
02:42:01.52 --> 02:42:07.36
you know, money because he was going through a divorce. And so that turned out, man, I, I just don't

1683
02:42:07.36 --> 02:42:11.36
know how to do anything half as, right? They're going to do something I'm doing, you know.

1684
02:42:12.56 --> 02:42:16.72
That's why I like all the physical stuff, the triathlon, the ultra marathon, so I put myself in a

1685
02:42:16.72 --> 02:42:23.84
hospital after the big foot 200, not after because I didn't quite finish my 177, I'm pissing blood,

1686
02:42:23.84 --> 02:42:28.48
grabbed him my leases, freaking, I was in bad bad. How many hours into it was,

1687
02:42:28.48 --> 02:42:36.72
right? It's probably 70, some day three. Yeah, you familiar with the company,

1688
02:42:36.72 --> 02:42:43.76
softly. Yeah, so brand, I don't know them, but I know who they are. Yeah, so brand, one of the,

1689
02:42:43.76 --> 02:42:49.28
the founders and owners, Marciac, do a good friend of mine. He joined me at my 112 with that race.

1690
02:42:50.08 --> 02:42:54.72
And I was already in bad shape from like a section of race. It was a lot of downhill.

1691
02:42:54.72 --> 02:42:59.68
Well, first we don't have mountains where I live in North Carolina, so I trained up here on a

1692
02:42:59.68 --> 02:43:03.12
stairwell. Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go to the gym and spend four and five hours

1693
02:43:03.12 --> 02:43:11.12
walking on a stairwell. miserable miserable stupid, but I said a goal, you know, I'm running,

1694
02:43:11.12 --> 02:43:14.16
at this point, this point, my life, I don't like running anymore, right? I just, I don't want

1695
02:43:14.16 --> 02:43:21.52
to run 200 mile race. Why? To say I did. Well, yeah, man, that race, one of the sections

1696
02:43:21.52 --> 02:43:27.12
is about 11 miles all downhill and I ran this shit out of it. And your muscles weren't used to that

1697
02:43:27.12 --> 02:43:33.52
quads destroyed them destroyed them. At my 112, I was already pissing blood. And that's from

1698
02:43:33.52 --> 02:43:39.04
the window. Yeah, my kidneys were hurting. I could feel it. I felt like somebody just worked on my

1699
02:43:39.04 --> 02:43:46.72
freaking back man. And by my 150 something at that age station, that was the last time I could

1700
02:43:46.72 --> 02:43:52.64
even keep watered down. My TBI was definitely flared up. I had a lot of damage to my brain

1701
02:43:52.64 --> 02:44:01.84
STEM and stuff when I got blown up in 2009. And the M&I, I was in bad shape. And I wanted to

1702
02:44:01.84 --> 02:44:05.52
sleep. He wouldn't let me sleep. Come to find out later. He was like, yeah, I was worried

1703
02:44:05.52 --> 02:44:11.44
you were going to die because I was having a seizure. And I was laughing about it. You know,

1704
02:44:11.44 --> 02:44:17.36
I had convinced myself, you know, you know, they're doing. I knew how we we can be. And I just took it

1705
02:44:17.36 --> 02:44:24.96
too far at by mile 177. And I'd gone, you know, almost an entire night, 20 some miles without any

1706
02:44:24.96 --> 02:44:32.000
food or water, no sleep. Just, you know, Brent was just trying to get me to the next aid station

1707
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.40
because it's in the mountains of Washington state around Mount St. Helms. They have no EVAC plan.

1708
02:44:36.40 --> 02:44:42.48
There's no way. And I'm probably the biggest runner on the course, right? I'm doing these 200

1709
02:44:42.48 --> 02:44:48.08
mile rays at like 215 pounds, you know, and I had lost weight to do it. You know, I think I

1710
02:44:48.08 --> 02:44:52.24
usually walk around a lot about, you know, 225, 230, it's your whatever. And I cut some weight to go

1711
02:44:52.24 --> 02:44:57.36
around this race. And how many months did you prepare for it? Like a year, you're in a half.

1712
02:44:58.08 --> 02:45:05.60
So we trained for about a half a year for the 2007 big foot Melissa Torherman Nyskus at like

1713
02:45:05.60 --> 02:45:15.44
mile 120. And so we stopped at mile 133. We were doing it together. And I had time, but during that last

1714
02:45:15.44 --> 02:45:20.32
trek, I didn't want to leave her. It was cold, way colder, and it was supposed to be. So we didn't,

1715
02:45:20.32 --> 02:45:26.56
I mean, teeth chattering. We were both hypothermic and she's busted her knee, can't move fast.

1716
02:45:27.52 --> 02:45:34.40
And so like mile 132 or three that aid station, we got there in time. And I could have taken off

1717
02:45:34.40 --> 02:45:39.52
with no rest or whatever and got to the next one, but I probably wouldn't have finished a race.

1718
02:45:39.52 --> 02:45:44.48
Right? I was just now as behind. And I would have never left her on that mountain, right? Like

1719
02:45:45.44 --> 02:45:50.80
especially hypothermia. You know, she's, she's never had hypothermia to where she was, you know,

1720
02:45:52.24 --> 02:45:58.72
freaking disoriented or something like that. And you know, just clearly, I wouldn't have left

1721
02:45:59.28 --> 02:46:04.16
a runner. I didn't know in her shape much less about leaving the most precious thing on this

1722
02:46:04.16 --> 02:46:09.12
planet to me. So we got to that aid station. I'm like, you know what? Screw it honey, we started it

1723
02:46:09.12 --> 02:46:14.48
together. Let's go get some breakfast together. You know, someone's coming up. So we drove back to Portland,

1724
02:46:14.48 --> 02:46:20.72
had some breakfast. The next year, she decided to do it, but we made a deal that we wouldn't do it together.

1725
02:46:20.72 --> 02:46:25.92
No preconceived notions. Her knee was still not healthy. She's like, I'll try it. I mean, that

1726
02:46:25.92 --> 02:46:29.84
says a lot about her, man. She's like, I got this energy. I'm going to give it a whirl. She did like

1727
02:46:29.84 --> 02:46:39.04
77 miles in dropped, only 77. She was busted knee. She's probably worse than us. But yeah, man,

1728
02:46:39.04 --> 02:46:47.52
at my ones, 176, 177, whatever it was, Brent was like, hey, man, I'm a runner ahead and make sure

1729
02:46:47.52 --> 02:46:51.84
the crew's ready. No, he was running ahead to make sure the medics and the doctors were there so they

1730
02:46:51.84 --> 02:46:58.08
could drop my ass. 200, five miles, man. You know, so had, you know, whatever it was, 29 miles

1731
02:46:58.08 --> 02:47:05.20
or something left. And I get there and then like, yeah, here's the drop paperwork. I'm not signing

1732
02:47:05.20 --> 02:47:13.28
that. I'm twitching, having seizures. My trick is freaking, like, not working correctly, you know,

1733
02:47:13.28 --> 02:47:18.32
my, so some of my damage and stuff, I used to be left handed. I'm right handed now because this

1734
02:47:18.32 --> 02:47:23.84
didn't work for a while. Like, I couldn't hold on to things. I definitely, but worse, I would have

1735
02:47:23.84 --> 02:47:29.76
a seizure. With your holding the glot in your hand, seizes, probably a good thing. So I switched

1736
02:47:29.76 --> 02:47:35.52
to be the right handed. All that was happening. I'm like, seizing and it's a, it's not a muscular

1737
02:47:35.52 --> 02:47:40.64
seizure. It's a sand s-seater and it's just weird. It doesn't hurt, but when it happens, it looks

1738
02:47:40.64 --> 02:47:47.44
weird. I was going to say, look at this point. And bro, the pictures of me, I'm gray. Right,

1739
02:47:47.44 --> 02:47:53.52
that whole dehydrated. My body temperature was 96.40 degrees. And my heart resting high rate was

1740
02:47:53.52 --> 02:47:58.48
like a buck 60 laying down a cot. You know, when you lay down, your heart rate should drop me,

1741
02:47:58.48 --> 02:48:05.20
my didn't. My body's freaking out. And I'm convinced, I got, it's only 29 miles. I've got this.

1742
02:48:06.32 --> 02:48:12.72
And luckily, luckily, one of those five people I chose around kind of scared of was helping me.

1743
02:48:13.52 --> 02:48:18.80
And he was like, hey, Bubba, you can either get your ass in that truck. I'm a put your ass in that.

1744
02:48:18.80 --> 02:48:25.20
Either way, you are done this race. And next time I'm here, I woke up in the hospital,

1745
02:48:25.20 --> 02:48:30.56
important in Oregon. How long was recovery from that? That's a, that's a more fun story.

1746
02:48:31.92 --> 02:48:39.28
Three weeks after that, on the last day to register for the Moab 240 mile or I went and got my blood

1747
02:48:39.28 --> 02:48:45.68
work done, 88% kidney function. I'm like, all right, I'm good. And I signed up for the Moab 240.

1748
02:48:45.68 --> 02:48:50.40
And how far away was that at the time? As far as, like how much time did you have before that?

1749
02:48:50.96 --> 02:48:56.24
Two weeks. Oh, it was only two weeks away. Last day to register for the Moab. And here's my

1750
02:48:56.24 --> 02:48:58.80
thought process. Oh, I got to hear this.

1751
02:49:02.16 --> 02:49:06.56
Because they hurt. And grabbed a hurt a lot more. It hurt of raptor, right? You know,

1752
02:49:06.56 --> 02:49:10.64
CrossFit made it famous. Everyone, you knew what raptor was. I knew, you know, but we all give

1753
02:49:10.64 --> 02:49:15.36
ourselves micro cases of it. And then we take days off. The reason, there's no days off in a four

1754
02:49:15.36 --> 02:49:22.08
day to an hour. So you don't get to recover. You know, he gets worse. Well, three weeks after

1755
02:49:22.08 --> 02:49:26.16
I go in and I'm like, okay, I'm trying to figure out, do I try another year? Because this is

1756
02:49:26.16 --> 02:49:31.04
the first thing in my life I've been after. First half ever did not finish. You know, man,

1757
02:49:31.04 --> 02:49:35.28
I've been like, first time goes and every hard course they ever sent me to, you know, and like,

1758
02:49:35.28 --> 02:49:40.48
this isn't, this isn't making sense to me. Volunteerly withdrawing the year before because Melissa

1759
02:49:40.48 --> 02:49:45.36
was hurt. I was okay with that. And like, it didn't hurt my feelings. You know, it didn't feel like I had

1760
02:49:46.08 --> 02:49:51.12
somehow compromised, you know, my soul. Your integrity is a man. Now, but now the big foot,

1761
02:49:51.12 --> 02:49:54.80
all right, I just think I'm always trying to kill me. And I'm like, hmm, okay, there's this

1762
02:49:54.80 --> 02:49:59.84
mo lab 240. It's all ran by the same people. I might just mo lab 240 miles. It's actually 240

1763
02:49:59.84 --> 02:50:05.60
three miles. Just like the big foot 200 is 25. I'm like, y'all need to fix your t-shirts because

1764
02:50:05.60 --> 02:50:10.08
that's not my check. A five mile. That's like a race in the area. So I'll give me credit. I want to

1765
02:50:10.08 --> 02:50:17.92
cut it. So the mo lab 240 to 143 miles. In my head was, okay, do I train a whole another year?

1766
02:50:17.92 --> 02:50:22.000
And when you train for a 200 mile, you're doing not going out at midnight and train until six

1767
02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:26.56
in the morning just to get training under your headlamps and stuff like that. It's miserable, dude.

1768
02:50:26.56 --> 02:50:30.000
And this point in my life, I'm not a runner anymore. And I don't enjoy training it.

1769
02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.92
I shit. Since then, I think I've ran about six miles. And that was 2018, right? And it's all been like

1770
02:50:35.92 --> 02:50:41.92
a three different on the PT test I had to take. You know? Yeah, I ran my bicycle now. I'm out and

1771
02:50:41.92 --> 02:50:46.64
bike and stuff. But anyway, yeah, man, I'm like, okay, I can train a whole other year. Maybe I

1772
02:50:46.64 --> 02:50:51.36
go knock out this 240 and just check this box and say I did a 200, right? It's 240. It should be good.

1773
02:50:52.16 --> 02:50:58.80
Make up for this disaster, silliness of the big foot. Last day of registered. I was down in Alabama,

1774
02:50:58.80 --> 02:51:04.000
teaching 20 scripts of fat cores. I drove to one of those local blood workplaces. I had my

1775
02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:10.08
labs pool interpreted it in myself pretty much qualified for that. Because you're going to be an 18.

1776
02:51:10.08 --> 02:51:14.40
No one for it's you're getting close. Man, I've done some nutrition counseling for people with

1777
02:51:14.40 --> 02:51:19.44
the gym, right? I can get a crit in teenage levels or almost back in normal. Almost.

1778
02:51:20.24 --> 02:51:25.36
Right? And like, all right, walk out the parking lot. I signed up for the 240.

1779
02:51:27.44 --> 02:51:32.48
Clearly, I know it's not a good idea because I didn't tell anyone until a couple days before already

1780
02:51:32.48 --> 02:51:36.80
had an 18 delta mine. It was going to, you know, crew me at the race and that just basically

1781
02:51:36.80 --> 02:51:41.12
means drive the truck from one eight states into the next and the truck is a place to sleep.

1782
02:51:42.24 --> 02:51:47.04
And so, yeah, man, I got into my 240. So, I always say that, you know, dumb dumb ranger Tony

1783
02:51:47.04 --> 02:51:52.000
did pick foot where I was like, I'll sleep in hour and night and I'll just keep moving and I'll

1784
02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:57.92
keep banking extra hours. Well, the Moab 240, I had just approached completely different.

1785
02:51:57.92 --> 02:52:04.48
I'm gonna sleep two hours to three hours every night and I'm gonna use every second of time

1786
02:52:04.48 --> 02:52:11.20
to make it from here to here. I was trying to bank time and go fast. Now you build up this extra

1787
02:52:11.20 --> 02:52:17.76
ton. When you're having people remember my finished time with that Moab 240?

1788
02:52:17.76 --> 02:52:22.80
Zero? I don't even remember what it was. All I know is I finished it and I got a picture of me

1789
02:52:22.80 --> 02:52:28.48
walking underneath a finished line. And I did have about six hours of spare, six-day hours of

1790
02:52:28.48 --> 02:52:34.88
spare, whatever it was. But the point here is unlike the big foot where I was trying to go so hard

1791
02:52:34.88 --> 02:52:42.08
and not sleep, I walked every step of the way, the last except for the last 13 miles of 243 miles.

1792
02:52:42.08 --> 02:52:46.16
I rocked it. You know, and you're just wearing one of them silly little vests, you know,

1793
02:52:46.16 --> 02:52:51.12
it might maybe 10 pounds enough to get you in between eight stations, which you know,

1794
02:52:51.12 --> 02:52:55.52
are pretty considerable. You're talking about an A6 and A6 and A6 and 20 25 miles.

1795
02:52:55.52 --> 02:52:59.44
You know, like marathons. It's not like a marathon or a ZA6 and every mile.

1796
02:53:00.08 --> 02:53:05.68
This is milling nowhere, nowhere, Moab. So yeah, man, I got crazy shit out and

1797
02:53:06.96 --> 02:53:13.92
freaking, I was so fresh and okay that hopped into truck and said to stay in Moab,

1798
02:53:13.92 --> 02:53:20.72
drove back to Denver. So yeah, man, freaking good experience. Don't necessarily recommend it

1799
02:53:20.72 --> 02:53:26.24
anyone. But if you do get a wild hair and want to run at one of those races,

1800
02:53:26.24 --> 02:53:31.36
give me a ring or a DM and I'll tell you my strategy. My strategy was rock,

1801
02:53:31.36 --> 02:53:35.04
March, the whole way. The only reason I even ran the last 13 is, I mean, it run the whole way.

1802
02:53:35.04 --> 02:53:39.44
As I linked up with a dude that I had met at the big foot and we checked it in.

1803
02:53:41.20 --> 02:53:46.96
But I wouldn't say that we ran the whole 13. We just picked up the paste, did some jog and Moab law.

1804
02:53:46.96 --> 02:53:54.48
But yeah, man, you know, I just got to get after it. You know, and purpose, you know, like

1805
02:53:54.48 --> 02:54:00.32
we talked about that whole having something, I don't know if you get dramatic, say having something

1806
02:54:00.32 --> 02:54:05.84
to live for, but that's ultimately what it is. And yeah, I stay busy. These days,

1807
02:54:06.64 --> 02:54:12.08
I'm over the craziness. These days, my PT is all about just staying healthy, so I can go hunting.

1808
02:54:12.08 --> 02:54:18.48
You know, that's it. I just, that's my only real hobby I have left. As long as I'm fit enough to throw

1809
02:54:18.48 --> 02:54:24.88
a 60 pound backpack one and go hike around the mountains and, you know, that's where I'm out in life.

1810
02:54:24.88 --> 02:54:30.16
I'm done. You know, Melissa's still getting to have to get it, just cross yourself in the gym.

1811
02:54:30.16 --> 02:54:34.64
I'm in there like, I think I'll do back and buy it. Maybe maybe just, you know, chest and

1812
02:54:34.64 --> 02:54:40.80
try the day, you know, and then a nice little light leg day, like my dead last man. So I just turned

1813
02:54:40.80 --> 02:54:44.88
to 46 and I was like, all right, you know, for fun, let's put some weight on there.

1814
02:54:45.52 --> 02:54:49.68
500 for three on a deadlift. I'm like, hmm, still not old yet. You know what I mean? I'm still

1815
02:54:49.68 --> 02:54:54.000
counting on it. But typically speaking, man, 400 on the deadlift is all I do and just do some

1816
02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.12
reps. I'm not trying to hurt me anymore. Because there are a lot of the stuff that I did, man,

1817
02:54:59.12 --> 02:55:06.48
my back hurt, my, you know, TBI hurt, always on that edge. And where did you get blown up?

1818
02:55:06.48 --> 02:55:12.96
In the rack. Yeah, um, freaking armored sedan, I demit for a striker.

1819
02:55:14.08 --> 02:55:18.56
Yeah, sucks. Man, I was the only one I've for in the vehicle to walk away and I didn't walk away.

1820
02:55:20.80 --> 02:55:28.64
Yeah, um, suck, man, freaking. We just happened. We were, we were the Mark car for the Ranger

1821
02:55:28.64 --> 02:55:33.60
Edge man. They were, they were going to action a big target for us. Where was it? No, not,

1822
02:55:33.60 --> 02:55:40.80
right, uh, Mosul. And so we basically, we were going to identify, we were going to identify the gate

1823
02:55:40.80 --> 02:55:44.64
that they were going to drive the strikers through just by simply pulling just past it and parking

1824
02:55:44.64 --> 02:55:48.56
into that point by the time they got there, I would already be out of the vehicle. Last thing I

1825
02:55:48.56 --> 02:55:54.72
remember is buckling my helmet, putting the buckle on. I just put my helmet on. And so yeah,

1826
02:55:54.72 --> 02:56:00.48
it was, um, you know, it's a level seven being W, but it's, you know, their bulletproofs, not last

1827
02:56:00.48 --> 02:56:10.08
proof, not definitely not EF people. EFP hit, um, right behind the rear seat. So the two boys in the

1828
02:56:10.08 --> 02:56:16.48
back seat man, they were DNAed and, uh, driver, I guess he died, you know, eight or ten hours afterwards.

1829
02:56:17.84 --> 02:56:22.24
The, um, a funny story man, like, you know, talk about small world stuff a few years later,

1830
02:56:23.04 --> 02:56:28.000
I'm running one of the training courses for the NSA, for them, for their security guys,

1831
02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:34.32
participating in that. And I was into the class, everybody got picked in this one young

1832
02:56:34.32 --> 02:56:37.76
Ranger or whatever, you know, throughout the class we had talked about, yeah, I worked for those

1833
02:56:37.76 --> 02:56:43.12
people. I was in Mosul, Bumbleblin, you know, because he's a student, he didn't ask until afterwards,

1834
02:56:43.12 --> 02:56:46.80
you know, they're by graduated, let's go get, you know, a stay, can some beer and he's like,

1835
02:56:46.80 --> 02:56:52.88
hey, uh, eight Tony, um, did you know that, that team of guys, that agency team of guys, or whatever,

1836
02:56:52.88 --> 02:56:58.72
um, up in Mosul, that, you know, they got blown up the whole team died, I was like,

1837
02:57:01.36 --> 02:57:08.24
hmm, I mean, 2009, and I was like, yeah, yeah, we were up there, man, we were, I was in

1838
02:57:08.24 --> 02:57:14.000
the Ranger, I mean, we helped recover that. We were on target for that, we were going to do that.

1839
02:57:15.20 --> 02:57:20.000
And they threw me in their structures, they thought I was dead. Because the reality is right,

1840
02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:26.08
I mean, it blew that car across three lanes. It was a main highway one, kind of Broadway.

1841
02:57:27.04 --> 02:57:31.12
We were in the right lane about to make a right turn into the neighborhood where the target was.

1842
02:57:31.12 --> 02:57:39.04
And it's why I just buckled my helmet. And, uh, at EFP, blew that car all the way across three lanes,

1843
02:57:39.04 --> 02:57:43.60
big medians, you know, the medians are there and stuff, right, across that, across three lanes and

1844
02:57:43.60 --> 02:57:52.56
down to alleyway. Yeah, hitting other cars, right, it wasn't a small idea. And how I lived, man,

1845
02:57:52.56 --> 02:58:00.80
I can only talk that one up to God, you know, and um, man, it hurt the blast injuries hurt.

1846
02:58:00.80 --> 02:58:08.40
I came to in Germany and it hurt everything hurt, man. Like, I say, like, my fingernails hurt.

1847
02:58:08.40 --> 02:58:15.44
My gut, splash gut, my lungs had a demon, my lungs. And, you know, the armored car probably,

1848
02:58:15.44 --> 02:58:19.68
you know, clearly saved me, blah, blah, blah, but yeah, man, my whole left side was screwed up,

1849
02:58:19.68 --> 02:58:25.68
freaking just from damage to that, and brainstorm, and all that stuff. And yeah, and that was why

1850
02:58:25.68 --> 02:58:32.64
you were a contractor. Because you ended up going back in, right? Yeah, I am. I, uh, I,

1851
02:58:32.64 --> 02:58:38.32
uh, 2012, I was like, you know what, you know, freaking, I did these, you know, this eight years,

1852
02:58:38.64 --> 02:58:43.12
maybe I should go back into guard. I could help the next generation, right, you know,

1853
02:58:43.68 --> 02:58:48.08
what's that thing about good intentions? I say that if you get out of the military and

1854
02:58:48.08 --> 02:58:53.20
go back into military, it's like taking your car, drive it into a parking deck,

1855
02:58:53.92 --> 02:58:58.88
putting in it reverse and then backing over the spikes and blowing your tires on one purpose.

1856
02:58:58.88 --> 02:59:05.60
That's what going back in the military is like. And I joke, I do joke, right? So, the, uh,

1857
02:59:06.80 --> 02:59:10.80
I'll try and keep that in mind. Because in all the time, I, you know, those mornings when I wake up like,

1858
02:59:10.80 --> 02:59:14.000
you know, I can probably not call some people. Yeah, I'll take me back there.

1859
02:59:15.04 --> 02:59:22.72
Right in rock and roll. No, I, um, I, I just went, and so I worked for ASD at Bands Skills Detachment,

1860
02:59:22.72 --> 02:59:27.52
the group level ASD. So I get to teach the courses like our CQB course of Fowl.

1861
02:59:27.52 --> 02:59:33.36
And it is worth it. But the guard is its own beast, right? There's like all the BS that you would put

1862
02:59:33.36 --> 02:59:38.40
up with with the active duty military. And then there's the guard. It has its own personality,

1863
02:59:38.40 --> 02:59:44.88
its own type of crap. And because it is part time thing for so many people and the few full

1864
02:59:44.88 --> 02:59:50.000
times that they, full timers that they have, they're trying to manage, you know, on half staff,

1865
02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.36
all these guys who all have problems who are all the most important people in their own lives,

1866
02:59:55.36 --> 03:00:00.08
its Valleblah. Luckily, I have an amazing admin staff where I work and stuff and they keep

1867
03:00:00.08 --> 03:00:05.84
us squared away. But, you know, it's still the military. It means because we're not full time,

1868
03:00:05.84 --> 03:00:11.52
we have to jump out of our asses to do stuff, you know, the budget, blah, blah, blah. Hell,

1869
03:00:12.80 --> 03:00:19.84
Alabama National Guard sent a bunch of people to DC after the January 16th. The federal government

1870
03:00:19.84 --> 03:00:26.96
has still not paid Alabama back for that, right? And that's across the board. There are

1871
03:00:26.96 --> 03:00:31.68
National Guard across our country that don't have funding to pay people. So, like some of

1872
03:00:31.68 --> 03:00:38.000
our full time guys in October when the fiscal year rolled around last fall lost their jobs for like

1873
03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:44.24
three weeks. It's like what? And these are people with mortgages and families and stuff,

1874
03:00:44.24 --> 03:00:48.000
you know, is their job? I'm like, oh, no, we don't have money because you know, Joe Biden don't want

1875
03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:53.36
to be a real-time job. So, the O.S. and his money. Right? Of course, you don't actually,

1876
03:00:53.36 --> 03:01:02.16
who signs the budgets, the Congress. So, is it Joe Biden's fault? Or is it a representative

1877
03:01:02.16 --> 03:01:08.96
as well? I don't know. I mean, I always go back to this, right? First page, Ranger Amba,

1878
03:01:08.96 --> 03:01:15.12
the leader is responsible for everything it does and does not happen when a mission or a patrol.

1879
03:01:15.12 --> 03:01:20.96
So, anyway, I got grass. But yeah, the guard man, it's good. I get interact with the young guys

1880
03:01:20.96 --> 03:01:30.88
on the up-and-comers, share some lessons learned and it's worth it. But, you know, if I go

1881
03:01:30.88 --> 03:01:37.20
teach, so far for four weeks, I'm back to make an army money. So, you know, you lose money,

1882
03:01:37.20 --> 03:01:44.72
doing it. And sometimes, you ask, is it worth it? I gotta go put up with this BS and, you know,

1883
03:01:44.72 --> 03:01:51.44
whatever. But then I remember like, hey, man, we now have a service full of all the combat.

1884
03:01:51.44 --> 03:01:56.80
That's got, there's no combat that has left in special forces. It's for the most part, right?

1885
03:01:57.44 --> 03:02:02.16
Same with the seals, man. I get some guys from up Virginia Beach that come down and use my long range.

1886
03:02:03.04 --> 03:02:07.92
All young, young pups and their snipers, I'm like, I thought snipers were supposed to be like,

1887
03:02:07.92 --> 03:02:12.40
the most experienced dudes are like, we are. Like, are you like 22?

1888
03:02:12.40 --> 03:02:18.32
Like, 26. Like, so you mean to tell me, you were one of the most experienced dudes in your

1889
03:02:18.32 --> 03:02:25.52
pool of 10 when you're in the 10. Now, I'm 30, yeah. Like, yeah, man, everyone within the experience

1890
03:02:25.52 --> 03:02:29.76
left. I'm like, well, crap, it's the same in the army, same in the Marine Corps.

1891
03:02:31.04 --> 03:02:36.000
So, I look at like this, man. I feel a little obligated to give back, you know, for whatever reason,

1892
03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:40.24
I am still here with all my fingers and toes. I still can't shoot. I still can't teach. And,

1893
03:02:40.24 --> 03:02:45.28
man, I get down there. I can't help but I'm not the dude on the catwalk. It's not how I teach.

1894
03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:50.96
I put my kid on and go and do CQB with the teams. And I'm like, all right, check it out guys.

1895
03:02:50.96 --> 03:02:55.60
And you're doing that as an act as a guard guard guy. And you, when did you go back in the guard?

1896
03:02:55.60 --> 03:03:00.32
2012, 2012. Did you go in any deployments once you get 2012?

1897
03:03:00.32 --> 03:03:04.08
I have it, not with them. God, yeah, that's that doesn't take good noff.

1898
03:03:04.08 --> 03:03:12.96
I mean, you know, if you, so I, I weighed out like this, since I've blown to ASD,

1899
03:03:12.96 --> 03:03:19.92
we're not a deploying unit in your, I wear a training detached guard. To go do an eight month

1900
03:03:19.92 --> 03:03:25.84
deployment with SF, the return of an investment just isn't there for me. A, it doesn't pay well enough.

1901
03:03:25.84 --> 03:03:32.40
It's too long, whereas I can do stuff, you know, with the agency and projects and stuff like that,

1902
03:03:32.40 --> 03:03:36.64
that are shorter. And we actually get to do so you still been contracting the whole time.

1903
03:03:37.44 --> 03:03:41.68
Did you go to Syria? Who you with over there with your contractor?

1904
03:03:41.68 --> 03:03:49.60
Yeah. What was that like? I mean, it's cool because like I said, where,

1905
03:03:51.84 --> 03:03:55.60
that would be the wrong, I was going to say, oh, these are different. The RREs aren't different. We have

1906
03:03:55.60 --> 03:04:02.16
a much more efficient training command. I don't have to ask for permission to, you know,

1907
03:04:02.16 --> 03:04:09.12
take a potty break, whereas, you know, teams typically to move from here to here have to ask for

1908
03:04:09.12 --> 03:04:14.000
mission. We are given a mission where allowed to go execute. We send up set reps. We don't have to ask for

1909
03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:18.32
permission. Most of the time, you know, we always have our market. There's some two in my eyes because

1910
03:04:18.32 --> 03:04:22.48
the time. Yeah, you know, it's not for free for all, but we get a mission and we go do it.

1911
03:04:22.48 --> 03:04:29.44
A lot of our stuff is, you know, the ASO type stuff, the source operations, and then

1912
03:04:31.04 --> 03:04:37.20
FO, you know, doing the reconnaissance, and especially with the layout of the ground, as far as

1913
03:04:37.20 --> 03:04:43.84
a local population, and a lot of permissie type stuff. You told me not to do that. Here I am with an

1914
03:04:43.84 --> 03:04:52.08
acronym, right? Freakin' three Cs like that area study of all the equations that make up a

1915
03:04:52.80 --> 03:04:58.56
an area whether it's, you know, population, resources, and all that sort of thing, not just like

1916
03:04:58.56 --> 03:05:03.36
combatants, right? The entire area. What's going on in this area? So we do a lot of that.

1917
03:05:04.72 --> 03:05:09.44
And of course, we can, you know, action targets if we need to typically, like in Syria,

1918
03:05:09.44 --> 03:05:13.84
since we were working in such small elements that, you know, it was like, hey,

1919
03:05:14.96 --> 03:05:20.24
got any rangers not doing anything tonight, you know? You know, we got, there's an ODA around here

1920
03:05:20.24 --> 03:05:27.12
that can come to do this, you know, where the seals that. But yeah, man, that type of work is really

1921
03:05:27.12 --> 03:05:33.92
cool. I've done stuff in Haiti, and we've got a lot of things going on that are, I said,

1922
03:05:33.92 --> 03:05:41.28
more, more US interest than national defense. And one definitely leads to the other, right? Like,

1923
03:05:41.28 --> 03:05:45.28
it's important. If you talk to a lot of people, like, oh, we need to withdraw from around the world.

1924
03:05:46.48 --> 03:05:51.28
Well, if we want to continue to be a superpower, we have to continue to influence in a positive way

1925
03:05:51.28 --> 03:05:57.36
around the world. It's a little why Ukraine is so hard to figure out right now.

1926
03:05:57.36 --> 03:06:05.20
Well, my take on the Ukraine is, hey, man, Europe is full of a bunch of really well-powered

1927
03:06:06.56 --> 03:06:14.40
modern nations. It is their AO, right? Yeah, with modern noters, very modern militaries, right? We,

1928
03:06:14.40 --> 03:06:24.24
we help with that. Russia wants Russian land back. The parts of the Ukraine, it really wants. I don't,

1929
03:06:24.24 --> 03:06:29.84
and maybe, maybe Putin, I don't know what Putin is thinking, right? Like, maybe he wants the whole nation.

1930
03:06:29.84 --> 03:06:36.40
But they've shown us since, you know, even, for instance, 14 when they took or they didn't take

1931
03:06:36.40 --> 03:06:41.84
Crimea, right? Crimea allowed themselves to be annexed. There's a big difference.

1932
03:06:43.92 --> 03:06:50.56
The Ukraine, you know, the South and East, they're native Russians, right? And that's again,

1933
03:06:50.56 --> 03:06:55.44
Americans were too stupid to know that there is a different, structural, Russian and Ukrainians.

1934
03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:00.80
They speak two different languages, right? And do they a lot of them speak both, of course.

1935
03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:06.24
You know, it would be no different in, like, the border of Texas. Lots of people spoke, speak both.

1936
03:07:06.24 --> 03:07:10.88
But there is a clear difference between Americans and Mexicans, right? And that's what's happened in here.

1937
03:07:11.92 --> 03:07:16.56
And in Ukraine, they Russia wants it lands back. Does Russia also want to want to

1938
03:07:16.56 --> 03:07:22.40
order port? Well, yeah, Russia's wanted to want to port for decades, a century or more now.

1939
03:07:22.40 --> 03:07:26.16
Probably longer than that since Navy's have been Navy's. They've wanted one more.

1940
03:07:26.96 --> 03:07:33.68
Well, okay, I get it. Are we at a point in our, so we have two things, right? Like, this

1941
03:07:33.68 --> 03:07:39.68
president who is weak, clearly, could stand up to Russia, to all line in the sand and be the

1942
03:07:39.68 --> 03:07:45.84
heroes and Russia doesn't get to invade. Or we can act tough. Russia invades. We look like a

1943
03:07:45.84 --> 03:07:51.76
bunch of pusses. And now we're obligated to fight. That's the wrong answer, man. American,

1944
03:07:52.48 --> 03:07:58.88
boys and girls don't need to go fucking die in the Ukraine. The Ukraine is one of the most corrupt

1945
03:07:58.88 --> 03:08:06.56
nations on this planet. Now, that is partly due to Russia keeping them that way. A corrupt Ukraine can't

1946
03:08:06.56 --> 03:08:13.20
get in the NATO. All right, NATO's not letting them in in their current state. It's just not happening.

1947
03:08:13.20 --> 03:08:17.04
So that's part of it. It's like, oh, we want them in NATO. If we really want them in NATO,

1948
03:08:17.04 --> 03:08:21.28
we let them join NATO three, five, ten years ago. They're not eligible.

1949
03:08:23.92 --> 03:08:30.80
So, I mean, come on, man. We got to, you know, like, there's a difference in messing and

1950
03:08:30.80 --> 03:08:35.04
meddling and getting ourselves into it. And you got to, you know, again, not a conspiracy theorist,

1951
03:08:35.04 --> 03:08:39.92
but what everything is going wrong for this administration, one can't help but to,

1952
03:08:39.92 --> 03:08:47.84
to at least entertain the idea that it's a distraction from all the other crappy mistakes.

1953
03:08:47.84 --> 03:08:54.48
Now, all of a sudden, Biden wants to look strong. Well, there's Biden and there's Putin.

1954
03:08:54.48 --> 03:09:00.000
And I don't think Putin is ready to step back from Biden. I think he's calling his bluff, man.

1955
03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:06.72
And I don't think that Biden has that, hey, let's sit down and hash this out type of freaking

1956
03:09:06.72 --> 03:09:17.28
mentality. Well, unfortunately, in that case, unfortunately, I have a hard time thinking that

1957
03:09:17.28 --> 03:09:22.72
that Biden could carry on a logical conversation and negotiation with Putin. Like, it just doesn't

1958
03:09:22.72 --> 03:09:30.08
seem like that's a feasible thing. I mean, he has a hard time. He has a hard time. He has a hard time

1959
03:09:30.08 --> 03:09:34.88
putting together sentences, right? I mean, putting together legitimate sentences that are prep form.

1960
03:09:34.88 --> 03:09:39.28
Right. That's just really, really, really disturbing, really, really horrible to see.

1961
03:09:39.28 --> 03:09:45.12
Yeah. And you think he's going to go in with freaking KGB agent and be able to carry on a conversation

1962
03:09:45.12 --> 03:09:50.56
and not get manipulated and take an advantage of it's very disturbing. A KGB agent that for the last

1963
03:09:50.56 --> 03:09:56.48
20 years has not been distracted by some wars in the Middle East. And we have been. He's been

1964
03:09:56.48 --> 03:10:01.76
preparing and preparing for whatever he wants to do while we've been messing about in the Middle East.

1965
03:10:01.76 --> 03:10:07.28
Yeah. And that's, you know, talking earlier about iterative decision making. Here's another bad

1966
03:10:07.28 --> 03:10:11.52
move when you're to leadership position. Is painting yourself into a corner? You know, don't

1967
03:10:11.52 --> 03:10:16.24
paint yourself into a corner. The world changes things change, but things to happen and you don't

1968
03:10:16.24 --> 03:10:20.16
put yourself in a situation where you can't say, hey, well, this is the direction we're going

1969
03:10:20.16 --> 03:10:23.60
now. It's a little bit different than where you were heading, but it's okay. Because I,

1970
03:10:23.60 --> 03:10:27.84
all time was saying, I might go in a different direction. That's okay. And you know what?

1971
03:10:27.84 --> 03:10:34.16
Let's say we have this amazing charismatic badass leader, which we don't, that allows us to

1972
03:10:34.16 --> 03:10:37.84
look like we're letting Russia paint us into a quarter. And then, boom, he's got a whole

1973
03:10:37.84 --> 03:10:42.16
number of plants. That would be cool. But that's not what's happening. That's not what happened.

1974
03:10:42.16 --> 03:10:46.16
Right? Like, that's that old, what's the, everybody likes to quote the whole, um, you know,

1975
03:10:46.16 --> 03:10:51.60
what's the Chinese book? Uh, Sunsir? Yeah, right? Um, always laugh. I'm like,

1976
03:10:51.60 --> 03:10:55.60
whenever somebody wants to, you know, sound like, you know, understand war, they're going to quote

1977
03:10:55.60 --> 03:11:02.32
that guy, you know, feudal Chinese battle and, you know, war theory, okay, cool, but

1978
03:11:03.28 --> 03:11:08.08
great. Some of us have actually participated in war. Thanks for quoting that. But there is a good,

1979
03:11:08.08 --> 03:11:12.08
the whole thing of, you know, the rules, appear weak when you're strong, you know, and

1980
03:11:12.08 --> 03:11:17.44
appear strong when you're weak, right? Like, always give mis signals to your, um, to your enemy

1981
03:11:17.44 --> 03:11:24.32
and adversaries. Yeah, that's not what we're doing. Our adversaries clearly understand that we have

1982
03:11:24.32 --> 03:11:31.04
a very broken leader. I don't even want to say, Lee, week. Um, because I would say that probably

1983
03:11:31.04 --> 03:11:36.72
a Biden as goofball as he has been throughout his career. You know, Biden in the 80s and 90s

1984
03:11:36.72 --> 03:11:45.76
was definitely an intelligent person, right? Um, that guy as a president probably could have been

1985
03:11:45.76 --> 03:11:52.32
decisive. But despite we have today, it's just an, you know, an old broken person. Um, and

1986
03:11:52.32 --> 03:11:59.12
any of that, you know, I talk about term limits. How about a retirement age? That was probably

1987
03:11:59.12 --> 03:12:04.80
government's point. Yeah. I mean, we have 80 plus year olds running our country and I was

1988
03:12:04.80 --> 03:12:11.60
asked people, yeah, would you trust your 85 year old grandma to walk your dog? Right? Like, put that

1989
03:12:11.60 --> 03:12:17.68
into perspective. What would you trust your 85 year old, your 80 year old grandparents with? And I'm

1990
03:12:17.68 --> 03:12:21.92
sure, there are plenty of outliers, right? There are a hundred years old out there that are brilliant

1991
03:12:22.96 --> 03:12:28.64
outliers never prove a rule. Military's retirement has a retirement age. Every industry has a

1992
03:12:28.64 --> 03:12:36.64
retirement age. Our government 65. Why are our, our justices, why are our representatives, why

1993
03:12:36.64 --> 03:12:43.76
are president allowed? What? I mean, it's socially acceptable to have a retirement age on these things.

1994
03:12:43.76 --> 03:12:52.000
You know, and of course, term limits. But it scares me that we are literally at a point right now

1995
03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:57.20
where this, this president, this administration could lead us into a world war. And we're not ready

1996
03:12:57.20 --> 03:13:02.08
for it. I mean, I'm sure, don't give me wrong. I mean, coming, we could take for American soldiers

1997
03:13:02.08 --> 03:13:06.000
that sailors get ready. Yeah. The military's ready for it. The military's ready technically

1998
03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:12.72
to fight, of course. But are we ready to start losing people in Ukraine, which a lot of people

1999
03:13:12.72 --> 03:13:16.88
couldn't even figure out where it is or map that we don't understand. We don't care about that much

2000
03:13:18.08 --> 03:13:22.48
against Russia, who's Russia. So who's ready for that? When you say who's ready,

2001
03:13:23.20 --> 03:13:28.000
I'd say we're ready to fight, of course. But are we ready to go and die? Well, and kill

2002
03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:32.24
bunch of people that we don't know and civilians that are going to die as well. It's like,

2003
03:13:32.80 --> 03:13:37.84
we may want to think through that a little bit. I'm all for helping our allies. Right? That's a

2004
03:13:37.84 --> 03:13:45.20
good thing. We need a strong bunch of allies. But the Ukraine has known for well over a decade.

2005
03:13:45.20 --> 03:13:51.36
Right? That Putin wanted that land back. So my question is, what has the Ukraine, what has

2006
03:13:51.36 --> 03:13:55.36
Ukraine have been told to you? No, it's what's called it, no Ukraine. Do you know why?

2007
03:13:56.24 --> 03:14:04.24
Because Ukraine, I guess it means frontier. And if you say the frontier, which is the Ukraine,

2008
03:14:04.24 --> 03:14:12.24
that's the frontier of Russia. So calling it the frontier, that's that's what I had in her

2009
03:14:12.24 --> 03:14:16.96
class from. Somebody told me like in a comment. I'm social media that it's not the Ukraine.

2010
03:14:16.96 --> 03:14:23.52
It's just Ukraine. Sorry. I don't know that I'm not purposely trying to diminish that nation.

2011
03:14:24.64 --> 03:14:32.56
No intent implied. Yeah, I don't know, Jack, man. It's so frustrating. It's like we have all these

2012
03:14:32.56 --> 03:14:37.28
problems. And again, I'm not the, I'm not the guy that says, hey, we have to completely withdraw from

2013
03:14:37.28 --> 03:14:41.68
the rest of the world. Now we have to be involved. Yeah, that's not the point. The main thing are status.

2014
03:14:41.68 --> 03:14:46.72
But like to just go metal with the Ukraine when they've done very little to prepare themselves

2015
03:14:46.72 --> 03:14:53.68
for this day, which they knew were was coming. They've done nothing to get their allies in Europe

2016
03:14:53.68 --> 03:15:01.04
to help them. They've, you know, like, hey, and again, any of these situations, any of these situations

2017
03:15:01.04 --> 03:15:05.12
around the world, just to say, oh, we're not going to get involved anymore. Anyone anymore. That's not a good move.

2018
03:15:05.12 --> 03:15:10.72
No, that's not a good move. It's a good move to say, well, okay, what's happening? What would make sense?

2019
03:15:10.72 --> 03:15:15.52
Let's try this approach. Let's see what happens with this approach. If this approach works,

2020
03:15:15.52 --> 03:15:19.36
cool, we'll continue doing vesting that approach. If that approach isn't working, we'll say, you know,

2021
03:15:19.36 --> 03:15:23.36
what? We didn't realize that there's a bunch of different, because Ukraine's got all kinds of

2022
03:15:23.36 --> 03:15:28.08
different factions in there. Oh, we didn't realize that. We, we, we, we looked at it a little bit too

2023
03:15:28.08 --> 03:15:31.92
broad, and we thought Ukraine was Ukraine and we was Ukraine against Russia doesn't really look like it's

2024
03:15:31.92 --> 03:15:36.80
that anymore. We're going to stand down, right? Or we're going to back away. Or we're going to really

2025
03:15:36.80 --> 03:15:42.80
support this group that we know is now come to the surface as being the prominent power there.

2026
03:15:42.80 --> 03:15:48.88
Okay? Instead of saying what we're saying right now, like we don't understand what's happening

2027
03:15:48.88 --> 03:15:54.80
fully, and we can't predict the future. So don't don't over index on things that you can't

2028
03:15:54.80 --> 03:16:01.76
predict. Don't do that in anything. Right. Well, and also, let's influence. Clearly, we are still

2029
03:16:03.84 --> 03:16:11.84
a superpower with tons of influence. Even if our European allies don't respect our current leader,

2030
03:16:11.84 --> 03:16:19.36
he still brings to the table and emits a amount of tools that he can use to sway them. Hey,

2031
03:16:19.36 --> 03:16:24.72
look, oh, hey, Britain, you guys don't want to back us up with whatever we want to do. We're

2032
03:16:24.72 --> 03:16:30.80
going to cut such and such off. Oh, hey, Germany. All those things. But because there's Eastern

2033
03:16:30.80 --> 03:16:35.68
Block, man, they all love us. Right? Hey, you know, there there are there are two allies now.

2034
03:16:35.68 --> 03:16:40.88
You've got, you know, the bridge, the French and Germans who are kind of, they've been flipping

2035
03:16:40.88 --> 03:16:44.96
their middle finger up to us quite a bit for the last seniors. Okay, guys, that's your stance.

2036
03:16:44.96 --> 03:16:49.92
Cool. We're going to continue to be friends with Romania and Hungary and Lithuanian Estonia.

2037
03:16:49.92 --> 03:16:55.92
Yeah, we're going to back them up because they're, they're on the line with Russia. You guys,

2038
03:16:55.92 --> 03:17:01.44
screw you guys. Take care of yourselves for a little while, right? Just like Trump wanted to pull

2039
03:17:01.44 --> 03:17:05.28
funding from NATO. Like you guys are going to start funding this. Right. He took a little bit

2040
03:17:05.28 --> 03:17:08.48
hard line with our allies. Like, hey, we're going to treat you guys like adults now. We're going to

2041
03:17:08.48 --> 03:17:12.32
cut some of your funding. You guys are going to start contributing. That's not a horrible approach.

2042
03:17:13.04 --> 03:17:18.96
Right? Accountability. Oh, own it. Right. You guys want NATO. You like NATO. Don't you? Right. You

2043
03:17:18.96 --> 03:17:25.44
guys like that security of having us backing you up from across the pond. Just like we did in

2044
03:17:25.44 --> 03:17:30.64
World War II. Yeah, y'all know. So check it out. Here's some new rules we're going to play by.

2045
03:17:31.60 --> 03:17:34.88
You know, we've been funding this thing. We're going to take a step back. We're going to let you

2046
03:17:34.88 --> 03:17:39.60
guys take the lead for a little while and see how you do with it. Right? There's nothing wrong with that.

2047
03:17:39.60 --> 03:17:45.60
No. And I think Trump was trying to do that. I don't know. You know, um, and you know,

2048
03:17:45.60 --> 03:17:53.52
let's face it. Those leaders in those countries, man, they, they, they led the way. They are the

2049
03:17:53.52 --> 03:17:58.80
Biden's ahead of Biden Europe. And America, I think we lead the way with everything. Like we led the way

2050
03:17:58.80 --> 03:18:04.56
with this crazy group. You left this presidency and all this stuff. No, man, Europe was way ahead of us on

2051
03:18:04.56 --> 03:18:10.24
that stuff. Their leaders, right? I have been crazy liberals for freaking, you know, five, 10 years now.

2052
03:18:10.24 --> 03:18:16.96
They, they definitely got to jump on that force, you know, not that that's a good thing. So until we,

2053
03:18:16.96 --> 03:18:22.56
just take a step back and say, hey, guys, deal with it. I do think, you know, clearly in this case,

2054
03:18:23.76 --> 03:18:27.20
war with Russia, war with China, man. You're talking something that would affect the entire

2055
03:18:27.20 --> 03:18:33.44
world and be so expensive for all parties, right? And here's the reality, doesn't war with us.

2056
03:18:33.44 --> 03:18:38.88
It would destroy his country and have a money for it. Exactly. So, choke him out.

2057
03:18:38.88 --> 03:18:44.40
Oh, that means cutting off that pipeline we told him they could have. Shit, that's going to

2058
03:18:44.40 --> 03:18:53.60
mean we have to freaking admit we were wrong. Sanctions, Russia can't afford and even more so, right?

2059
03:18:53.60 --> 03:19:01.44
Like if the rest of the world distance themselves from Russia stops and Russia's standing there with

2060
03:19:01.44 --> 03:19:06.40
a China that's kind of their ally, but also trying to shut them out of the way at the same time.

2061
03:19:06.40 --> 03:19:12.72
And I ran, that's your friends Putin, the rest of the world's kind of tidy up all's crap.

2062
03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:21.60
And they go back to behaving, right? And ultimately again, root cause, why does Russia want this?

2063
03:19:22.56 --> 03:19:27.20
Why does Russia want it? We just identify that, we can cut them off in the knees.

2064
03:19:28.80 --> 03:19:32.32
It's just so frustrating, man. And again, you know, always step back and say, you know what,

2065
03:19:32.32 --> 03:19:39.76
I don't know everything. I don't, I don't get to peek behind that curtain, right? Like clearly Biden or whoever's

2066
03:19:39.76 --> 03:19:46.88
running our country, Vice President Harris, they know way more than I do. So, I'm always going to give

2067
03:19:46.88 --> 03:19:52.72
any administration a little bit of benefit of a doubt, right? Like, you know, I always, I hate it,

2068
03:19:52.72 --> 03:19:56.08
growing up in military where it's some key leader would be like, well, you just don't understand the

2069
03:19:56.08 --> 03:20:01.12
big picture. And then as I got older, I realized that I don't understand the big picture.

2070
03:20:01.12 --> 03:20:05.84
Yeah, of course, they didn't either, right? Like, that was their way of saying like,

2071
03:20:05.84 --> 03:20:09.76
you know, we don't really know what the hell's going on either. But now in the motor, I do have

2072
03:20:09.76 --> 03:20:16.72
an acceptance that I don't have the big picture. And I never will, right? None of us will ever know

2073
03:20:16.72 --> 03:20:21.36
what the president of the United States knows, right? I think there's no security clearance out there

2074
03:20:21.36 --> 03:20:28.80
to touches what that guy gets to know or that guy, presumably one day. No, so you, as us,

2075
03:20:28.80 --> 03:20:32.88
as the guys who work for that commander, she always has to come sit back and go, okay, they know

2076
03:20:32.88 --> 03:20:40.16
more than us. So, I always try to keep that reserve, you know, like that to keep me from creating

2077
03:20:40.16 --> 03:20:46.32
assumptions and assertions that are realizing that my assumption and my assertions are always

2078
03:20:46.32 --> 03:20:55.36
going to be less informed, right? Yeah, they've got massive intel, that works briefing every day,

2079
03:20:55.36 --> 03:21:01.76
sources all over the world, like they got some information. Right. Still, I like to think

2080
03:21:01.76 --> 03:21:07.84
to take do some good stuff with it. Me too, like, please, God, because right now, man, what we've

2081
03:21:07.84 --> 03:21:13.04
gotten ourselves into is scary. And again, and as you guys have a China, like, you've talked about China,

2082
03:21:13.04 --> 03:21:17.84
what if China makes a move on Taiwan now? Like, they're not sitting over there going, oh, well,

2083
03:21:17.84 --> 03:21:25.28
if Americans leave you in Ukraine, that the withdrawal from Afghanistan is what set this stage,

2084
03:21:25.28 --> 03:21:30.40
right? Like, I don't know anybody except for some staunch left supporters of, I don't even know

2085
03:21:30.40 --> 03:21:36.08
if there's any Biden supporters left, but there are the Democrats, right, who are just never going to

2086
03:21:36.08 --> 03:21:41.12
say that they were wrong for voting for him or that he anything they've done is wrong, right?

2087
03:21:41.12 --> 03:21:49.76
This is how our system works, but the reality is, any objective synthetic thinker knows that this

2088
03:21:49.76 --> 03:21:55.28
all started with our withdrawal from Afghanistan and the weakness that was just, you know,

2089
03:21:56.32 --> 03:22:05.28
sent out across the world worldwide. So what was the, or was there a straw that broke the

2090
03:22:05.28 --> 03:22:11.52
camel's back that made you say, I'm, I'm going to go and run, because I mean, let's face it, here you are,

2091
03:22:11.52 --> 03:22:18.40
how would you say you are? Just turn 46. Just turn 46. You got businesses, you got a cool woman in

2092
03:22:18.40 --> 03:22:25.60
your life, you got a nice place to live or whatever. Yeah. Seems like you could be going into

2093
03:22:26.32 --> 03:22:31.60
actual literal retirement mode. Yeah, like, incentive, enjoying your life,

2094
03:22:31.60 --> 03:22:36.16
warm mode, right? And that's where I was at, and I've been working towards it pretty hard,

2095
03:22:37.20 --> 03:22:43.52
even living in Wilmington drove me insane, stop lights and traffic and, you know, just, I flew in

2096
03:22:43.52 --> 03:22:51.12
yesterday. I'm happy because, you know, Melissa and I bought 62 acres about an hour outside of Wilmington,

2097
03:22:51.76 --> 03:22:58.32
you know, it came with three dockies and chickens and fenced impasters and we turned our dog's loose.

2098
03:22:58.32 --> 03:23:04.08
And I mean, if I want to walk around my yard naked, you know what I mean? It's that type of country,

2099
03:23:04.08 --> 03:23:09.84
you know, it's the same way I grew up. And I think, you know, whether that's genetic or not,

2100
03:23:09.84 --> 03:23:16.08
I've always creved it. I like to be in places where it's just quiet, you know, growing up on the

2101
03:23:16.08 --> 03:23:24.000
coast, you know, the water and then because of a dare, or someone talking smack, I went to die

2102
03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:28.40
school, wound up on a dive team. I wanted to be on the mountain team. I went to Afghanistan and

2103
03:23:28.40 --> 03:23:32.72
fell in love with the mountains because before I've got to stand, I had done some training in Colorado,

2104
03:23:32.72 --> 03:23:37.44
but not really done enough to fall in love with the mountains and the thin air and all that.

2105
03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:42.40
Well, you went to Afghanistan, man, and I was just, man, you know, I remember looking around like

2106
03:23:42.40 --> 03:23:49.68
in Torrebore and stuff and, you know, like, wow, this would be some amazing snowboarding,

2107
03:23:49.68 --> 03:23:55.12
like, what are they doing here? You know, and at the time, I didn't realize that it actually was a

2108
03:23:55.12 --> 03:24:02.40
destination back in the 60s. They're up my stepmother and her friends all went to Kabul in the late 60s,

2109
03:24:02.40 --> 03:24:09.68
the smoke weed. Yeah, my stepmother is she was so funny of my mom, you know, a North Carolina girl,

2110
03:24:09.68 --> 03:24:16.56
country girl, a farm girl, my grandfather was a farmer and my stepmother's from out here. Oh,

2111
03:24:16.56 --> 03:24:22.96
yeah, she was from like, uh, oh, I should say, uh, I forgot her hometown, but um,

2112
03:24:24.32 --> 03:24:29.92
between here in LA. And uh, so she was like, I hippie. A little bit in the 60s turned into

2113
03:24:29.92 --> 03:24:36.32
unless she was traveling to Afghanistan smoking pop music, but not like, uh, not like an anti-government

2114
03:24:36.32 --> 03:24:42.48
hippie, just like a California young girl, you know, whatever. So cool stories, you know, and I had no

2115
03:24:42.48 --> 03:24:48.000
idea that was that part of Afghanistan that it was actually very Western and modern during the 60s.

2116
03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:53.52
You know, Kabul, you look at pictures, you know, the roads are nice. It's clean, people are smiling, you know?

2117
03:24:55.28 --> 03:25:00.24
So anyway, yeah, man, I'm just not into the city, you know, I was these days,

2118
03:25:00.24 --> 03:25:06.08
you put me behind a tractor or a combat and I got to go six mile an hour for 10 miles. No stress.

2119
03:25:06.08 --> 03:25:12.16
I'm not even good at whatever, you know, I don't care. Because living out there I'm rarely in a hurry.

2120
03:25:12.16 --> 03:25:16.72
I have days that I have work to do in clients and guys to shoot with and classes, but

2121
03:25:16.72 --> 03:25:22.32
on my days off, man, I'm my boss, you know, and don't get me wrong. I can be my own kind of a

2122
03:25:22.32 --> 03:25:29.52
pain in my ass, but I'm flexible with my time. So no stress, you know, um, got out of the city,

2123
03:25:29.52 --> 03:25:33.84
everything's awesome. It sucks from the list of because she drives almost an hour every day,

2124
03:25:33.84 --> 03:25:40.80
one way to her pose. But, you know, she's, she's chill. Um, you know, she loves to listen to her podcast

2125
03:25:40.80 --> 03:25:44.48
and all that kind of stuff. And, you know, she's a dentist, so she works four days a week.

2126
03:25:45.20 --> 03:25:50.48
And, um, so Friday she gets to go and do whatever she wants or whatever. So, you know, before we did it,

2127
03:25:50.48 --> 03:25:54.88
you know, it's like, hey, are you sure? Those are our prices cute, man. And I found it by accident.

2128
03:25:54.88 --> 03:25:58.32
It just happened. We driving down that road, took a different route home one day,

2129
03:25:58.96 --> 03:26:03.12
and, uh, solid for self-sign, put off the side road, put up Google Maps. You could kind of see the

2130
03:26:03.12 --> 03:26:09.36
property lines. I was like, oh, call the realtor, man. We closed on it. So, yeah, you know,

2131
03:26:09.36 --> 03:26:15.60
there are days where like my most intelligent conversation is with a couple of donkeys and some

2132
03:26:15.60 --> 03:26:22.000
dogs. I don't even see people. You know, my nearest neighbor, well, my nearest nearest neighbor is

2133
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:26.40
like some methods that live like, you know, half a mouth through the woods. Um, we basically have

2134
03:26:26.40 --> 03:26:31.44
an agreement that they, um, they set up my business and, you know, I set it up their business

2135
03:26:31.44 --> 03:26:36.40
and their trailer doesn't burn down. Um, you know, how meth cook houses sometimes, you know,

2136
03:26:36.40 --> 03:26:40.96
catch on fire. So we're good. You know, we're good. Every none did all wake up and like,

2137
03:26:40.96 --> 03:26:44.96
you know, I can hear their music playing it like four in the morning or something, but other

2138
03:26:44.96 --> 03:26:50.16
not, they don't mess with me. I don't mess with them. They're just redneck methods. And then the

2139
03:26:50.16 --> 03:26:54.08
other neighbor man is kind of cool. She lives like 1.2 miles away and she's completely deaf.

2140
03:26:54.64 --> 03:26:59.28
So she can't hear the range. Other not. No one lives within two miles of us, you know, so we get out

2141
03:26:59.28 --> 03:27:07.12
there and shoot and shoot and shoot and no one cares. So it's real cool, man. Yeah. So we were playing

2142
03:27:07.12 --> 03:27:11.52
on moving to Idaho. As the costs were going up, we're starting to look at Montana as well,

2143
03:27:11.52 --> 03:27:16.24
because a couple years ago, Montana being really expensive, Idaho was still like, all right?

2144
03:27:16.24 --> 03:27:20.64
And the cool thing about Idaho for me is while the rockies aren't as high there, they don't have

2145
03:27:20.64 --> 03:27:27.76
the same elevation and say Colorado or wherever Idaho is like 60% public land.

2146
03:27:27.76 --> 03:27:35.76
Lots of hunt and access. And I like hunting, but I like being on those mountains, man. You know,

2147
03:27:35.76 --> 03:27:43.60
it's just quiet. Most times it's just me and Melissa. But yeah, man, we found a couple different places

2148
03:27:43.60 --> 03:27:49.12
where we're looking at one place very seriously in Idaho City, just in the USA. And then,

2149
03:27:49.12 --> 03:27:53.92
and then, everything in America started happening. Because man, that's where I was at.

2150
03:27:53.92 --> 03:27:57.52
You know, my business is doing great. I mean, Melissa's a dentist. So like,

2151
03:27:58.64 --> 03:28:03.12
where she read into pollchocks too? Yeah. And for her to do that, it's kind of a big deal.

2152
03:28:03.12 --> 03:28:09.20
Like, you know, clearly like I said, I can pack a backpack and a duffle bag and move.

2153
03:28:09.20 --> 03:28:16.32
You know, it's got some guns out of the safe. Let's go. She clearly, you know, I mean, she's got

2154
03:28:16.32 --> 03:28:19.44
18 or 19 employees. We're all females.

2155
03:28:19.44 --> 03:28:24.72
They're always fun because they've always got something going on. You know,

2156
03:28:25.92 --> 03:28:30.16
I don't want to call it drama because that would be dismissing it. But the dynamics in that

2157
03:28:30.16 --> 03:28:35.60
office are always fun to listen to. You know, because I have team dynamics stuff. And then I get

2158
03:28:35.60 --> 03:28:40.96
the list and listen about her team dynamics. And it's like, a lot of the same stuff that we would

2159
03:28:40.96 --> 03:28:47.28
do with only with a hint of, you know, the lady stuff. You know, I don't like, wow, I don't

2160
03:28:47.28 --> 03:28:51.60
envy her at all. Because at least like on a TV and in theory, you could always go out back and

2161
03:28:51.60 --> 03:28:56.16
sort it out, you know, at least going there and put the gloves on and sort back shit out, right?

2162
03:28:56.16 --> 03:29:02.16
She doesn't have that option. So yeah, man, um, we were really close to pollinator going on

2163
03:29:02.16 --> 03:29:05.20
moving. And we had talked about it for years. Like, our first date,

2164
03:29:06.16 --> 03:29:10.40
that we claim as our first date, right? We were when she and I met,

2165
03:29:11.12 --> 03:29:15.44
she and her boyfriend had just broke up me in the garage and had just broke up and we were real

2166
03:29:15.44 --> 03:29:20.16
skeptical of each other. We had known each other from the gym and kind of looked at each other

2167
03:29:20.16 --> 03:29:25.68
like, oh, oh, oh, oh, who's that punk? Who's that punk? You know, both very strong personalities.

2168
03:29:25.68 --> 03:29:30.000
She's her own boss, same with me and been a boss for a while now. I don't really,

2169
03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:36.96
and that dynamic was just so interesting as we came together, we kind of kept it quiet that we were

2170
03:29:36.96 --> 03:29:42.72
seeing each other. So our kind of our announcement to all of our friends and you how a gym can be

2171
03:29:42.72 --> 03:29:49.12
everyone's friends from the gym and um, we did a hike across the Bob Marshall Building as out in

2172
03:29:49.12 --> 03:29:55.60
Montana. Very, but it wasn't supposed to be a hike across. It was supposed to be a loop back to

2173
03:29:55.60 --> 03:30:04.48
the car two days, 20 some miles. Well, that night we hit our turnaround point. We woke up in the morning

2174
03:30:04.48 --> 03:30:11.04
and there was smoke everywhere. Largest forest fire ever in the flathead national forest and

2175
03:30:11.04 --> 03:30:19.36
the Bob Marshall was inside the flathead. Oh, now what? So now we are running from a forest fire all

2176
03:30:19.36 --> 03:30:24.40
way across the Bob Marshall. So it was like 70 or so miles and we didn't even have the food for it.

2177
03:30:25.36 --> 03:30:32.24
And right now in the console of my truck or protein bars, they're not mine. They're for her.

2178
03:30:33.12 --> 03:30:37.20
Her favorite protein bars because the last thing anyone wants is from a list that get hunger.

2179
03:30:37.20 --> 03:30:45.68
We angry, she's a hangry woman. So Melissa is half German and half Japanese.

2180
03:30:46.88 --> 03:30:54.24
I live with the access powers. Keeping her fed is a priority. I'm telling you, man.

2181
03:30:54.96 --> 03:30:59.76
And it's not like a gradual dissent. It's everything's cool and now she just wants to tell your

2182
03:30:59.76 --> 03:31:05.52
throat. And you don't know it. Yeah, and you don't even know it's coming. I'm like, I'm blissfully,

2183
03:31:05.52 --> 03:31:11.60
you know, like, you know, I'm not real crazy or angry about my diet anymore. My thing is like,

2184
03:31:11.60 --> 03:31:15.84
I just, you know, I started getting older, started not having abs as much. So I just quit eating

2185
03:31:15.84 --> 03:31:20.72
breakfast as much. Simple. Some people call that intermittent fasting. I call it screw it less calories.

2186
03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:29.12
No fancy diet names here. And no dude, she needs to eat. So we have to keep her fed. But yeah,

2187
03:31:29.12 --> 03:31:36.24
we run out of food running across the bad Marshall. So you're one day in when the force fire hits. And how many?

2188
03:31:36.24 --> 03:31:41.44
What's the total day? Oh, we want to do it in in in two and a half, two and three quarter

2189
03:31:41.44 --> 03:31:46.16
days and 70 some miles. Maybe we had to go across the continent of the vise. Like you got to climb like

2190
03:31:46.16 --> 03:31:54.56
9,000 feet in like a mile a half. It's like zig zig zig zig. I mean, we're going up the zig zags, right?

2191
03:31:54.56 --> 03:32:00.72
The switch bags. And I remember looking up the trouble go here to here and on the trail right there

2192
03:32:00.72 --> 03:32:05.04
were three or four mil deer and I was looking up at their bellies like right there. But I could

2193
03:32:05.04 --> 03:32:10.96
still almost touch them. It was like this. Anyway, I bless your heart man. On that trip across

2194
03:32:10.96 --> 03:32:16.48
the bottom of Marshall's, she learned how to read a top of Matt. Prick in was running the GPS. She

2195
03:32:16.48 --> 03:32:19.76
never done that stuff. Of course she doesn't. I mean, she had an ice climb, mountain climb,

2196
03:32:19.76 --> 03:32:24.32
hike in all kinds of national forests, her and her buddy from dental school were like a

2197
03:32:24.32 --> 03:32:29.84
ventricly young ladies out. In some cases they tell me stories I'm like, that was dumb and dangerous.

2198
03:32:29.84 --> 03:32:33.68
You could have been one of those missing person stories. And they were like, yeah, probably.

2199
03:32:34.64 --> 03:32:40.88
Well, anyway, just that type of person man. And we had to cost the white river and it's an

2200
03:32:40.88 --> 03:32:47.28
august so it's snowmelt. You know? And man, I made a huge mistake, freaking. So because she's so

2201
03:32:47.28 --> 03:32:54.40
physically fit. But now she's she's 120, maybe 125 pounds at this time. And I'm like, oh, this is

2202
03:32:54.40 --> 03:33:00.16
a good place across this river. I mean, it's rolling. I think need deep to me. That's halfway her

2203
03:33:00.16 --> 03:33:07.60
quads. I got across, dropped my pack and I could see she was struggling. Right? And I'm pretty sure

2204
03:33:07.60 --> 03:33:12.32
footage. I've been in the woods, backpacks, walking steak. She's kind of walking steak. But it's

2205
03:33:12.32 --> 03:33:18.08
got her where it started to leverage her off. And man, I got back out there and you know, the rocks

2206
03:33:18.08 --> 03:33:23.92
under that water slick. And I'm like, get out there, man. And I put my hand on her backpack. She slipped.

2207
03:33:24.48 --> 03:33:30.24
We went in drink. Oh, I was lucky. I got underneath her. And man, it was like that. Hold,

2208
03:33:30.24 --> 03:33:39.68
push her up. Get me some air. Go back under. And man, I got scuffed up. My whole backside, my knees.

2209
03:33:39.68 --> 03:33:45.12
This whole side just beat up. She's got her pack on. So she's pretty protected or whatever.

2210
03:33:45.52 --> 03:33:49.20
And luckily, there's a curve in the river. Because a couple hundred meters on down this way is

2211
03:33:49.20 --> 03:33:53.44
the salmon river. If we had gone in that, go through those little bit of falls. And into that river,

2212
03:33:53.44 --> 03:33:59.20
we would have died. Right? Luckily, a little curve, man. It watched this up on the shore. We kind of

2213
03:33:59.20 --> 03:34:04.48
crawled out, laid there. It's warm in the afternoon, but man, the water was cold. Real cold.

2214
03:34:04.48 --> 03:34:09.12
And like cold enough to wear it. I'm bleeding and scuffed up, but I can't feel it. I don't know who

2215
03:34:09.12 --> 03:34:14.56
I'm going to be sore. This is good. It's up. She rolls over and looks at me. She's like,

2216
03:34:14.56 --> 03:34:18.80
you saved my life. And I was like, yeah, we're going to go with that. He's still busy.

2217
03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:24.08
Because I'd take that river across the mountain, almost killed her. Almost killed that girl, man.

2218
03:34:25.12 --> 03:34:32.16
And I will never, it spooks me even talking about it, right? Freaking in there. And because

2219
03:34:32.16 --> 03:34:37.76
who would have believed afterwards that I chose that river crossing, right? They're like, oh,

2220
03:34:37.76 --> 03:34:42.96
he did that over purpose. He drowned that girl. But no, we were new. And I was like, oh, I'm in love

2221
03:34:42.96 --> 03:34:50.80
with this chicken stuff. And it horrified me that I had made such a stupid decision. Just stupid.

2222
03:34:50.80 --> 03:34:55.52
But we were running from a forest fire, whatever. Freaking haste, all that. I did learn that

2223
03:34:55.52 --> 03:35:00.80
she's not one of us. You know, it's still have to be careful. She's smaller, so on and so forth.

2224
03:35:01.52 --> 03:35:06.32
Anyway, man, we get across there, whatever, Freaking that was like our first date coming out of

2225
03:35:06.32 --> 03:35:11.04
the closet as far as our statement and stuff. And man, it was ever since then, every vacation

2226
03:35:11.04 --> 03:35:19.44
we took was to the mountains. She wants to climb Everest. It clearly puts me in an interesting position

2227
03:35:19.44 --> 03:35:24.32
because I don't give a damn about climbing Everest. But I can't just let my girl go through now.

2228
03:35:24.32 --> 03:35:28.88
I guess I'm going to have to go up there too. Or I just suck it up and say, hey, honey, I'm

2229
03:35:28.88 --> 03:35:33.36
a wait for you in a base camp, Freaking. Hang out with these pieheads. Freaking, I'll talk to you on

2230
03:35:33.36 --> 03:35:38.24
the radio. Are you dead? You're going to keep going, right? Some of that thing. But now, so we

2231
03:35:38.24 --> 03:35:44.24
start climbing the 14ers in Colorado. So we're doing that stuff, man. Just falling in

2232
03:35:44.24 --> 03:35:47.68
the level of the mountains. Point being is we want to move the mountains. Her best friend from

2233
03:35:47.68 --> 03:35:53.28
dental schools in Colorado, or originally, tell me I'm going to Colorado and then it got a little

2234
03:35:53.28 --> 03:35:58.88
California on us. Lots of public hunting land there. One of two states left that you can get over

2235
03:35:58.88 --> 03:36:05.36
the countertags for elk. No big deal. And if you leave Denver, Boulder, right? Go up anywhere.

2236
03:36:06.08 --> 03:36:11.92
Freaking, it's still Dodge trucks with bumpers. You know, it's still diesel pickups and good

2237
03:36:11.92 --> 03:36:17.60
over-anch boys. So I would do Colorado if she wanted. But we kind of figured on, I don't bunch

2238
03:36:17.60 --> 03:36:21.36
of my friends with a dyto, probably bunch of your friends who have dyto, it's like the,

2239
03:36:22.16 --> 03:36:27.04
where everybody's going. It's the last conservative holdout I guess. Well,

2240
03:36:27.04 --> 03:36:32.24
we were that close, man. We were getting ready to pull the trigger on moving. And like I said,

2241
03:36:32.24 --> 03:36:38.40
a big deal for her with her primes. And then everything started happening. The pandemic, the

2242
03:36:38.40 --> 03:36:44.56
weirdness, it got to the point where I was like, wow, one year ago, if you'd asked me how long

2243
03:36:44.56 --> 03:36:50.24
it was going to take first to get right here, how to say 20 years. But somehow, the US got put

2244
03:36:50.24 --> 03:36:57.52
on fast forward to its progressive decline. And every nation has it. My history tells us every

2245
03:36:57.52 --> 03:37:03.76
culture fails. And we have some very distinct parallels to the last greatest culture, right?

2246
03:37:03.76 --> 03:37:14.96
The last greatest city state, Rome, the Roman Empire. You know, she was dead. A nation and

2247
03:37:14.96 --> 03:37:20.64
culture found it on slavery, on the backs of slaves, right? There are many parallels. A nation

2248
03:37:20.64 --> 03:37:26.000
who cared more about entertaining themselves than protecting their borders, right? It's some spooky

2249
03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:33.76
parallels. And I'm like, oh, and then I'm talking to my very good friend, Alario Pantano.

2250
03:37:34.72 --> 03:37:42.48
Alario, if you go ahead, he was the marine in Voluca that shot and killed two terrorist

2251
03:37:42.48 --> 03:37:52.24
dirt bags. And then was charged with their murders. Lieutenant, Type, you know, he, his

2252
03:37:52.24 --> 03:37:56.32
between, he had lost some boys to debut before. So he was an elistic guy, Scott sniper,

2253
03:37:56.88 --> 03:38:01.12
was working on Wall Street. I'm not allowed to happen, doing great for himself and his family,

2254
03:38:01.12 --> 03:38:10.16
smart guy, real smart dude. And not allowed to happen. And he got back in. And then in Voluca,

2255
03:38:10.16 --> 03:38:17.04
man, you know, for killing two very clearly terrorist, right? Member Feluca, get out or fight

2256
03:38:17.04 --> 03:38:21.60
us. Anybody that stays, you're a bad guy. And then we're bad guys. They had weapons in the

2257
03:38:21.60 --> 03:38:26.80
trunks on and so forth. What got weird? You can look at story up, but bottom line, they charged

2258
03:38:26.80 --> 03:38:32.32
it with murder. Two counts of it. And for how many months of his life, he was

2259
03:38:33.28 --> 03:38:38.000
having to fin him stuff against the nation. And he's so much love. They went to war for

2260
03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:44.96
war. Well, Alario ran for Congress in 2010 and 2012. A better bright before than in 2008,

2261
03:38:44.96 --> 03:38:50.80
time frame when I opened my gym. So I watched and as he was running, I was still very apolitical.

2262
03:38:51.52 --> 03:38:58.56
Was it really interested, so on and so forth? The primaries didn't work out for him. They were fighting

2263
03:38:58.56 --> 03:39:03.92
him and another fellow who is now the incumbent, again, David Rouser. They were fighting for that area.

2264
03:39:03.92 --> 03:39:10.96
And what they were really fighting was a 30-some-year Democrat incumbent. Well, between the two of

2265
03:39:10.96 --> 03:39:17.76
them, they did finally outstim and but David Rouser bested Alario in a primary. He just had more

2266
03:39:17.76 --> 03:39:24.80
pool and one, highly populated segment of that district and David came out the winner.

2267
03:39:26.80 --> 03:39:31.04
Since then, Alario, he became the director of Veterans Affairs and stuff for North Carolina,

2268
03:39:31.04 --> 03:39:35.52
Long story short man, just you know, his dedicated life to trying to take care of service members

2269
03:39:36.24 --> 03:39:42.16
and just a great guy. But last Easter day, we're sitting on a tell-get in my truck out of the range

2270
03:39:42.16 --> 03:39:48.48
and we're just chatting. He took a job at Syracuse University and was living up in Syracuse down

2271
03:39:48.48 --> 03:39:54.16
visited and we were just chatting about things, the nation, the state of it, so on and so forth.

2272
03:39:54.16 --> 03:40:05.04
And I was like, hey man, so I was thinking about potentially maybe duty hops off the tell-get

2273
03:40:05.04 --> 03:40:10.24
and he's like, he can get excited. When he gets excited, he's really excited. He's like, yes,

2274
03:40:10.24 --> 03:40:15.84
if there's ever a time, it's 2022, the nation's ready for it, the climate needs you. It's this

2275
03:40:15.84 --> 03:40:20.56
this is, he just got, he didn't even let me finish. He knew what I was going to say and which I

2276
03:40:20.56 --> 03:40:25.68
thought was pretty cool because I don't necessarily think I, you know, broadcast something like that,

2277
03:40:25.68 --> 03:40:30.72
especially something so out of that bill for me that he just had a feeling. And it was funny

2278
03:40:30.72 --> 03:40:34.72
because it's Easter day and he's like, you know what? I was like, well I'm just kicking around.

2279
03:40:34.72 --> 03:40:40.56
I'm not sure he's like, it's Easter day and there's it's clearly God sent me here today to tell

2280
03:40:40.56 --> 03:40:47.60
you that you must absolutely do this and I'm sitting there going. Okay, not really where I thought

2281
03:40:47.60 --> 03:40:53.20
this was going to go but now I'm like, all right, all right, so if he feels this strongly about it

2282
03:40:53.20 --> 03:40:57.84
and he's the first person that I've even mentioned it to, maybe this is something I should look at.

2283
03:40:58.88 --> 03:41:02.96
And at the time I'm still like, I just want to move to Idaho. I just want to go hunting.

2284
03:41:02.96 --> 03:41:08.72
That's what we left alone in my own business. Then I realized at the reason we were at

2285
03:41:09.28 --> 03:41:15.12
because dudes like me have been mining our own damn business while the left has rallied protested,

2286
03:41:15.12 --> 03:41:22.24
organized and executed a subversion campaign that the world liked the world's never seen before.

2287
03:41:23.44 --> 03:41:31.20
A very successful subversion campaign. So fast forward a little bit so that was Easter day.

2288
03:41:32.16 --> 03:41:36.96
Loria puts me in contact with the folks who are now my consultant team and all that. We start

2289
03:41:36.96 --> 03:41:40.96
kind of exploring. All right, let's come up with some courses of action to see if they're viable.

2290
03:41:40.96 --> 03:41:46.08
Let's see if this works. Well, North Carolina in the census picks up an extra an additional

2291
03:41:46.08 --> 03:41:50.40
non-actual, an additional seat. So we had 13 now we're going to have 14.

2292
03:41:51.76 --> 03:41:53.60
Representative, you have a house or representers.

2293
03:41:55.12 --> 03:41:59.92
Yeah, man. So we're like, okay, let's just we're going to have to wait and see because right now

2294
03:41:59.92 --> 03:42:05.60
I live in that same district with the incumbent David Rouser and by all means a pretty square

2295
03:42:05.60 --> 03:42:12.80
way to. He hasn't, hasn't done anything to really upset anybody. He's not a rhino. I wouldn't say he's

2296
03:42:12.80 --> 03:42:19.12
like the champion of all things patriotic America either but what he has then has taken care of his

2297
03:42:19.12 --> 03:42:27.92
district, which is agriculture. I think he's probably going to become the lead on the agriculture committee.

2298
03:42:27.92 --> 03:42:35.20
At least that's what I've heard. Well, so we decided, hey, look, if I'm going to run, I'm going to have

2299
03:42:35.20 --> 03:42:40.40
to wait to see the new districts because challenging rousers probably a losing thing. I'm not doing

2300
03:42:40.40 --> 03:42:45.52
America any good, challenging an opponent that can't be beat. That's not a good strategy, right?

2301
03:42:46.48 --> 03:42:50.72
And you know, especially the guy that's doing what he's supposed to do, represent his

2302
03:42:50.72 --> 03:42:56.72
district. That's right. I am all for challenging Republican incumbents that suck. They need to do.

2303
03:42:56.72 --> 03:43:02.16
Right. And I've said numerous times, reelect no one, reelect no one. But the reality is there

2304
03:43:02.16 --> 03:43:11.92
are still some good dudes up there who need some backup. They need a QRF. Right. So the new

2305
03:43:11.92 --> 03:43:18.96
districts come out and the county I live in and a couple others to include cumboing county

2306
03:43:18.96 --> 03:43:23.52
fed of the Fort Bragg, Hornet County is a little block. It's almost a square, right? The middle

2307
03:43:23.52 --> 03:43:28.96
of North Carolina, mostly roll and I live in it and it's got fit. Oh, for a break. I'm like, oh,

2308
03:43:29.84 --> 03:43:36.56
okay. Now we're making sense and no incumbent. They. All right. Like it's ready made. It's just

2309
03:43:36.56 --> 03:43:43.52
sitting there ready for me to go woo them around for cons. So we announced man and we had already put

2310
03:43:43.52 --> 03:43:47.52
it together. We're ready. We're just waiting on those districts and he was like, okay, this this

2311
03:43:47.52 --> 03:43:53.60
makes sense. Right. I can do this and hopefully go do some be part of positive change. Help correct

2312
03:43:53.60 --> 03:43:59.84
this trajectory. I joke that it's like a 308 trajectory. We're trying to make it like a, you know,

2313
03:43:59.84 --> 03:44:06.56
a 375 in A-Boah trajectory. You know, let's let's let's flatten this curve. Not the pandemic

2314
03:44:06.56 --> 03:44:11.52
curve. I was like flattened this trajectory curve that America has been placed on by crazy socialists.

2315
03:44:11.52 --> 03:44:18.56
So yeah, man, that happened. We said, okay, cool. This makes sense. But you asked like this

2316
03:44:18.56 --> 03:44:24.24
straw that broke the camel's back, man. I'm not usually a super sentimental type person or whatever,

2317
03:44:24.24 --> 03:44:30.88
but that my father passed last summer. We held his memorial service over July the fourth week in

2318
03:44:31.52 --> 03:44:36.88
my niece, my older sister's daughter. I guess that motor sister is a very successful

2319
03:44:36.88 --> 03:44:42.80
pediatric pediatric and her chronologist. My niece has never known what it's like to miss a meal.

2320
03:44:46.64 --> 03:44:51.44
She doesn't know suffering. And in a lot of ways, I'm kind of that guy's like, this next generation

2321
03:44:51.44 --> 03:44:57.36
sucks and these boys need to learn how to change all in their car. We all get into that sometimes

2322
03:44:57.36 --> 03:45:02.32
like, man, this next gen is just weak. But I'm looking at my niece who is this beautiful young lady

2323
03:45:02.32 --> 03:45:10.16
lacrosse player. She's almost six foot tall, stud, pre-can a gear ahead in school, super intelligent.

2324
03:45:10.16 --> 03:45:16.96
All right? Not only was my sister, you know, more aggressive than these, she's a brilliant mind.

2325
03:45:17.52 --> 03:45:24.96
So her son and her daughter got some of this. Anyway, they come to the house. My niece is a

2326
03:45:24.96 --> 03:45:32.24
plan. You know, my sister's in biotech. So she lives in Boston. So my niece is a city kid. So she's

2327
03:45:32.24 --> 03:45:37.36
out on my, you know, property riding the four-wheeler, playing with the dogs, for you can throw them,

2328
03:45:37.36 --> 03:45:41.52
you know, the dummies into the pond for the retriever. And I'm just looking at her.

2329
03:45:42.64 --> 03:45:49.36
And like, she's never known when it's like to not have Wi-Fi. That level of luxury, right?

2330
03:45:49.36 --> 03:45:53.92
Like, that's America. I mean, even the poorest people in America today have it pretty good. Like,

2331
03:45:53.92 --> 03:46:00.32
homeless people in America, you know, have it pretty good. You know, we take care of even our

2332
03:46:00.32 --> 03:46:05.12
poorest. But I'm looking at her. I'm just like, huh, she's never known when it's like,

2333
03:46:05.12 --> 03:46:09.36
like, since she's been able to use a smart phone, they've had Wi-Fi on airplanes.

2334
03:46:11.84 --> 03:46:16.40
And I was like, I don't want it. I don't want her to ever know what it's like, not to live in that type of

2335
03:46:16.40 --> 03:46:24.80
luxury. I don't want her to live in what Western Mosul looked like in 2005, 2006. And then for the whole

2336
03:46:24.80 --> 03:46:29.20
entire net of it, it'd be burned to the ground and crushed in the indigenous folks of

2337
03:46:29.20 --> 03:46:35.20
none of a city to be murdered by ISIS, right? Like, I don't want her to know an America at war with

2338
03:46:35.20 --> 03:46:42.08
itself. And if we keep on this trajectory, that is a potential course. And that scares the shutt of me.

2339
03:46:42.08 --> 03:46:46.96
And I don't know that any of us will be alive to see that type of demise of our culture,

2340
03:46:46.96 --> 03:46:53.52
but she might be. All right, she's 16 years old. And that was a day that I was like,

2341
03:46:54.56 --> 03:47:00.96
all right, let's do it to lie the fourth week in last year. And it wasn't because it was July the

2342
03:47:00.96 --> 03:47:05.44
fourth weekend. It just happened, right? This is kind of a, I guess, a cool story. And I'm not a very

2343
03:47:05.44 --> 03:47:10.08
sentimental type person or whatever, but it was about my knees. It was the weekend that we

2344
03:47:10.08 --> 03:47:19.36
memorialized my father's life. And I was like, okay, eight years is all due that that will put me

2345
03:47:19.36 --> 03:47:25.76
at 55 years old. And then I'll retire. And I was hopefully, if I continue the path that I'm

2346
03:47:25.76 --> 03:47:31.20
when I would maintain physical fitness and at 55, I'll still be fit enough to go,

2347
03:47:31.20 --> 03:47:36.08
whatever, great thing, I'm going to chase around a mountain. But I was like, you know what,

2348
03:47:36.08 --> 03:47:42.56
if not me, then I'm out of place where I can, like I said, I'm able to sit on the shoulder.

2349
03:47:43.76 --> 03:47:50.32
And you know, as well as I do, right? Like overseas, I had different times in my life where I

2350
03:47:50.32 --> 03:47:54.56
wouldn't take a married guy with kids on my team. I would take that young ranger.

2351
03:47:56.000 --> 03:48:00.08
Because I know he wasn't distracted. I built a team there for a while that was just,

2352
03:48:00.08 --> 03:48:06.16
hmm, there were some scary young men. They had no distractions. I have sent men home

2353
03:48:06.16 --> 03:48:11.36
for being on the phone too often, too late, are you with their spouses? Hey, go, go home,

2354
03:48:11.36 --> 03:48:18.24
sort it out. I'll see you in a few weeks. Or bro, hey, man, I understand if you don't want to come back,

2355
03:48:18.24 --> 03:48:23.44
go take care of your family. But you don't get to be here running operations with us,

2356
03:48:23.44 --> 03:48:29.68
while you got that distraction on your, on your mind. So I don't have kids, man. I can go,

2357
03:48:29.68 --> 03:48:36.40
and go to DC and be fully vested, right? While another person like me who might be considering

2358
03:48:36.40 --> 03:48:42.48
around that has two kids, they need to go to a ballet concert or ballet recital, a concert,

2359
03:48:42.48 --> 03:48:48.64
or a band concert, or a soccer game, or a lacrosse game, or football game, or whatever.

2360
03:48:48.64 --> 03:48:54.80
You'll be sitting at your desk. I can get the work. Yeah. You'll be making shit happen.

2361
03:48:54.80 --> 03:49:00.08
The whole desk image just ruined the bro. Can we not put me behind a desk?

2362
03:49:02.24 --> 03:49:08.48
Yeah, you know, I was joking. I was like, I want to make C-span the most watch news in that

2363
03:49:08.48 --> 03:49:18.72
work. I like that one. I want to be tuning in to see you. What in the world has Tony?

2364
03:49:18.72 --> 03:49:25.68
And so this is kind of cool. Right. AOC in that weird bunch that called them the squad.

2365
03:49:25.68 --> 03:49:33.04
Right. Clearly not an infantry squad. So myself, Jake Collins is a seventh grouper who's running

2366
03:49:33.04 --> 03:49:39.92
in Florida. He's an amputee. He's a stud man, a stud of studs. And so he's running down in Florida.

2367
03:49:39.92 --> 03:49:44.08
He's doing really well as well. We were joking that, hey man, if they can have the squad,

2368
03:49:44.08 --> 03:49:50.24
we'll be the JTF. The joint task force. Right. And that's the thing. We're trying really hard

2369
03:49:50.24 --> 03:49:56.40
to take it all of America. That's a caucus. The JTF caucus, the veterans caucus. What if you want to

2370
03:49:56.40 --> 03:50:02.000
call us? But yeah, man, that is how I made that decision. It's like, you know, hey man,

2371
03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:07.84
there is an entire generation of Americans that needs to be taken care of, that needs to be set

2372
03:50:07.84 --> 03:50:16.24
up for success. And I feel like it's my generation, the 40, the 60 year olds right now who have

2373
03:50:16.24 --> 03:50:21.04
fell this last generation and allowed all this to happen because we were just hard working

2374
03:50:21.04 --> 03:50:27.28
conservatives that minded our own damn business. And by money owned damn business, we elected these

2375
03:50:27.28 --> 03:50:33.68
spinalous cowards that went to DC and sold us out time after time again. Coppermise our rights

2376
03:50:33.68 --> 03:50:38.24
away, right. Everybody's hard to say and conservatives haven't conserved a damn thing. Because

2377
03:50:38.24 --> 03:50:44.48
conservatives are good people and they think dealing with the left is a rational thing. The

2378
03:50:44.48 --> 03:50:48.48
problem is the left are not rational people. They only want what they want and are not going to

2379
03:50:48.48 --> 03:50:54.88
compromise. The right just keeps compromise and bit by bit by bit. Every single right that we hold

2380
03:50:54.88 --> 03:51:01.68
dear, they let it go. Peace by peace by peace. And that's all this nation can fall. Right? There's

2381
03:51:01.68 --> 03:51:07.04
clearly no nation on this planet is going to invade us. Right? And get anywhere. You know, the old

2382
03:51:07.04 --> 03:51:10.72
there's a gum behind every blade of grass, right? The Japanese newspaper they weren't hitting this

2383
03:51:10.72 --> 03:51:17.28
mainland, right? China knows they can't say it with Russia. The only way we can fall is if we

2384
03:51:17.28 --> 03:51:23.36
allow it. And we have allowed this country to get where it's at. And when I say we, I mean us, all of

2385
03:51:23.36 --> 03:51:28.72
us good people, it's our fault. I made a post on social a couple weeks ago, week ago when it

2386
03:51:28.72 --> 03:51:36.96
was. And I, I titled it, you know, the biggest problem in America, question one. It's us.

2387
03:51:38.48 --> 03:51:47.92
Right? It's us not being involved. I ask people who's your representatives. What district do you

2388
03:51:47.92 --> 03:51:52.48
live in? Who's your county commissioners? Are you involved in a local GOP? Are you,

2389
03:51:52.48 --> 03:52:00.40
or not, man? We're not. And in the wild, the Democrats are organized, super organized.

2390
03:52:01.68 --> 03:52:07.44
We're not. And that's how we lose. We don't even vote the average voter in a primary.

2391
03:52:07.44 --> 03:52:15.12
When the Republican conservative side, it's 57 years and older. Young, your conservatives are not

2392
03:52:15.12 --> 03:52:19.76
involved. And part of that problem is, there's a lot of young people in this nation generation,

2393
03:52:19.76 --> 03:52:26.96
they, they don't realize that posting comments and things on social media, it's not real action.

2394
03:52:28.16 --> 03:52:31.76
Right? And I'm not even being funny about it. You used to be, you used to be kind of a joke

2395
03:52:31.76 --> 03:52:36.40
that you know, like, okay, you think fighting on internet, it's not like a real fight.

2396
03:52:36.40 --> 03:52:44.08
And that man, it's like they really, they have begun equating same things on internet as if it's

2397
03:52:44.08 --> 03:52:50.48
a real thing that somehow influences, right? Because we use the term influencers, you know,

2398
03:52:50.48 --> 03:52:55.20
I'm influenced in a damn thing. You know, even with a little bit of followers, I have an Instagram,

2399
03:52:55.20 --> 03:53:00.64
I ask people, I beg, I say, I am pleading with you. Please go join your local GOP. How do we

2400
03:53:00.64 --> 03:53:07.92
get involved? I mean, go join your local GOP. How do I do that? Okay, you own your phone,

2401
03:53:08.64 --> 03:53:12.72
and I want you to put Google, or whatever, search is, and you're using these days.

2402
03:53:12.72 --> 03:53:19.28
I want you to type in your county's name and the letters GOP or Republican Party.

2403
03:53:20.40 --> 03:53:23.92
And you will find their website and you will find out that they have monthly meetings.

2404
03:53:23.92 --> 03:53:27.12
And you'll go there and you'll find out that on average there's only 30 people there.

2405
03:53:28.64 --> 03:53:34.000
No one. And they are the conservative, like, bruhs, they want to be involved.

2406
03:53:34.88 --> 03:53:41.20
But they're the ones that will tell you, like in North Carolina, they want 15,000 volunteers

2407
03:53:41.20 --> 03:53:49.04
to watch the polls. They sit at the polls, 15,000 people. And it's not enough. That's a very,

2408
03:53:49.04 --> 03:53:55.52
very low number. They probably need double that because early voting, two and a half weeks.

2409
03:53:56.80 --> 03:54:01.76
Right? Yeah, I have people watch the polls for for our shifts to shift per day.

2410
03:54:01.76 --> 03:54:05.68
Need two people per shift. At least, right?

2411
03:54:05.68 --> 03:54:14.08
Right? The need is there. And you know, always, I was just, this generation, if they want something,

2412
03:54:14.08 --> 03:54:18.48
just like our generation two, if we want something and we want to get and participate in something,

2413
03:54:18.48 --> 03:54:22.96
and it becomes our hobby man. We know everything about it because we YouTube it and we Google it.

2414
03:54:22.96 --> 03:54:27.92
And we, and we, so all right here, everything you want to know, everything known to mankind,

2415
03:54:27.92 --> 03:54:33.52
except for classified information and some of that is all right here. It's in the phone, right?

2416
03:54:33.52 --> 03:54:38.72
So if you want to know how to get involved, man, it's right here. And when you go and you talk to

2417
03:54:38.72 --> 03:54:42.96
those people, those meanings, yeah, man, they're the fanatics. They're the really passionate,

2418
03:54:42.96 --> 03:54:48.32
conservative Republicans who really do want to change that Republican Party, the image of the

2419
03:54:48.32 --> 03:54:54.80
old GOP, the rhinos and all that. If you go to these GOP, means, man, they're mad at the Republican

2420
03:54:54.80 --> 03:55:00.000
party. They're the Republican Party, they're mad at the Republican Party. They want to get rid of the rhinos.

2421
03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:04.24
There's the people who want to renovate that party because I hear people say,

2422
03:55:07.36 --> 03:55:12.48
you know, maybe we need a third party. Okay, that's not a viable course of action.

2423
03:55:12.48 --> 03:55:17.52
The America's not ready for it. It would take the Democrats and the Republicans

2424
03:55:17.52 --> 03:55:21.12
getting together and deciding the third party was a good thing.

2425
03:55:21.12 --> 03:55:24.56
Didn't we either decide to surrender to whatever power they have or not?

2426
03:55:24.56 --> 03:55:29.20
Not going to do. Power is like a matter. It never goes away. It can be transferred.

2427
03:55:30.40 --> 03:55:35.44
And we have transferred willingly, power, throughout our nation's history.

2428
03:55:36.24 --> 03:55:40.16
A good example is when we gave minorities to the right of them.

2429
03:55:42.72 --> 03:55:45.76
So we are capable of doing it. We gave women the right of them.

2430
03:55:47.44 --> 03:55:53.68
So we have transferred power willingly, typically speaking throughout American human history,

2431
03:55:53.68 --> 03:56:00.80
power is transferred because it's taken. It's rarely given that that's what makes America special.

2432
03:56:00.80 --> 03:56:07.68
Is that we have given power willingly in an effort to create this amazing country.

2433
03:56:10.08 --> 03:56:17.84
But yeah, man, freaking, you know, it's going to take us getting involved. The biggest problem

2434
03:56:17.84 --> 03:56:22.88
on this planet is that in America today, that's going to continue to lead us down this path

2435
03:56:22.88 --> 03:56:26.48
and not change this trajectory is us mining our own business.

2436
03:56:27.44 --> 03:56:33.36
And I get it, man, you got a job. You got a couple kids and if you don't get involved,

2437
03:56:33.36 --> 03:56:37.92
right? Because what happens when you go to the GOP and you're

2438
03:56:38.72 --> 03:56:44.32
eight, ten, and fourteen year old. So you get involved. What are they going to grow up to do?

2439
03:56:45.20 --> 03:56:49.36
It's setting the example, right? Set the example. They seed the standards. All that military

2440
03:56:49.36 --> 03:56:55.60
leadership talk. It's not bullshit. No, you know it's not bullshit. We're an entire book about it.

2441
03:56:55.60 --> 03:57:02.80
A couple of them, right? You know, setting the example for your children is not just making

2442
03:57:02.80 --> 03:57:08.64
sure they're taking care of, right? We've got to get involved and if we don't, man.

2443
03:57:10.48 --> 03:57:15.44
Like I said, our adversary, they're very involved. They're organized and they're scary.

2444
03:57:15.44 --> 03:57:22.000
I asked people I'm like name one thing. The left has wanted in the last six years they

2445
03:57:22.000 --> 03:57:32.000
have been gotten. One is complete reversal of the segment. Why? Because there's a bunch of people out there

2446
03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:39.04
with guns that ain't going to let it happen. Other than that, every niche special interest they've

2447
03:57:39.04 --> 03:57:43.84
ever wanted, they've gotten it. And now it's like they're just bored looking for shit. You know what I mean?

2448
03:57:43.84 --> 03:57:49.28
Like the transgender is free-gid in college sports. Like, all right. We're just going to make up some

2449
03:57:49.28 --> 03:57:53.28
stuff that actually goes against our whole feminist movement. And like it's like they're bored.

2450
03:57:53.28 --> 03:57:58.16
Like we got everything we want. What else can we take from them? And but they're going to continue

2451
03:57:58.16 --> 03:58:05.60
to take because whether or not most laughs truly won't communism, there are enough folks out there

2452
03:58:05.60 --> 03:58:12.08
that do that believe that communism is the right path. Well, the rest of them will follow.

2453
03:58:12.08 --> 03:58:17.76
Because they actually have leaders. Right? You mean you're telling Hillary Clinton is not an effective

2454
03:58:17.76 --> 03:58:22.32
leader? I'm not saying she's a good leader. I'm saying she's an effective leader, right? Like

2455
03:58:22.32 --> 03:58:28.56
Putin is an effective leader. He's not a good person. She's definitely not a good person. She's

2456
03:58:28.56 --> 03:58:34.80
effective. They want things Hillary Clinton hadn't gotten that she wanted presidency. And I don't

2457
03:58:34.80 --> 03:58:43.36
know that she's done yet. It's scary shit. What we're fighting that one out soon. I'm hopefully

2458
03:58:44.72 --> 03:58:50.000
I got a factory down in Ashboro, North Carolina. I think it's a sixth district. Hopefully at some

2459
03:58:50.000 --> 03:58:55.12
point when I cut down there in the next several months we can link up definitely. And hang out.

2460
03:58:55.12 --> 03:58:59.36
You got to come check out the factory for sure. I haven't been there yet, but actually we have

2461
03:58:59.36 --> 03:59:02.64
two factories. We're consolidating in the process of consolidating right now, but

2462
03:59:02.64 --> 03:59:10.16
hundreds of jobs, hardworking people, funny thing. Man, that district, I think, because we've

2463
03:59:10.16 --> 03:59:15.28
had so many changes, that is probably the district that Christian Castanelli is going to run in.

2464
03:59:15.28 --> 03:59:22.24
He's one of those eight T.B. Lieutenant Colonel Types, seventh grouper. He now chat quite a bit.

2465
03:59:22.24 --> 03:59:28.88
And it's going to be a real tough race for him as well. He had more counting. And now they redistrict

2466
03:59:28.88 --> 03:59:33.68
again. And I could say that it could redistrict another time. It's going to do a course this week.

2467
03:59:34.88 --> 03:59:39.84
It's frustrating. And it's easy to do. So you know right now which you wear your running

2468
03:59:40.96 --> 03:59:46.08
for right now. Okay, but it could change. So yeah, was that new fourth which was Samson County

2469
03:59:46.96 --> 03:59:51.68
Johnson County, a little bit of Wayne County, Hornet County and Cumballon County. And now it's the new

2470
03:59:51.68 --> 03:59:57.36
new 13th. And that's Duplan County, Samson County, Johnson County, a little bit of Wayne County

2471
03:59:57.36 --> 04:00:03.52
and Southern Wake County. And it's so weird because these new districts, they don't hold communities

2472
04:00:03.52 --> 04:00:08.000
together. And it was like again, it was the Republicans were trying to make the dims happening.

2473
04:00:08.72 --> 04:00:12.88
Get some stuff pushed through that would actually work. Meet all the numbers because the districts

2474
04:00:12.88 --> 04:00:21.20
have to have equal numbers. Right. And to do that, you know, you've got to get a city in here and

2475
04:00:21.20 --> 04:00:26.40
a part of a city over there. And it's not like it's like, okay, just pick this region. You know,

2476
04:00:26.40 --> 04:00:31.36
it's more complex than that. So this new district again,

2477
04:00:32.48 --> 04:00:37.36
art man. And like I said, this goes back to Republicans trying to make the Democrats happy.

2478
04:00:37.36 --> 04:00:45.52
The Democrats suck at them again. So we have an activist, very left-laning Supreme Court in North Carolina.

2479
04:00:46.32 --> 04:00:50.72
And so when these new districts, the Democrats challenged them. It went to Supreme Court.

2480
04:00:50.72 --> 04:00:55.76
They booted them. They had to rewrite them. So they rebuilt them. The house did a set. And I like

2481
04:00:55.76 --> 04:00:59.44
that map pretty good. This new one. I don't dislike it. It's just not my favorite because I

2482
04:00:59.44 --> 04:01:06.48
lost Comberland County. I want to represent Fayetteville for a drag. It's kind of personal.

2483
04:01:08.40 --> 04:01:19.12
So the this week, they have to go to a three panel, court, three judge panel in the court. And that's

2484
04:01:19.12 --> 04:01:25.20
two conservatives one level. It will get the thumbs up there. Most likely, the Democrats will

2485
04:01:25.92 --> 04:01:31.44
challenge it again. But the Shastee, like sinister part, is when they were building these maps.

2486
04:01:31.44 --> 04:01:36.08
It was by parison in the Senate and in the house. Both parties working together. They created

2487
04:01:36.08 --> 04:01:40.40
this map. Dems gave them a thumb up. It went to vote. Dems all voted against it.

2488
04:01:40.40 --> 04:01:49.52
Suckers now what? Because it's divided half and half. And one Republican voted with the Democrats.

2489
04:01:50.24 --> 04:01:54.96
That sets the precedent for it to go to the court and then toss it out. They can be like,

2490
04:01:54.96 --> 04:01:59.36
look, y'all don't even agree on it. It's clearly by parison. This is supposed to be or it's clearly

2491
04:01:59.36 --> 04:02:06.08
partisan. They set them up again. And it's like, you guys are bending over backwards. When you

2492
04:02:06.08 --> 04:02:09.84
use it on a draw the line in the sand. They could draw the line in the sand and take it to the

2493
04:02:09.84 --> 04:02:18.000
US or US Supreme Court. That's expensive. And it takes a fight. And time. That's a time. And they're

2494
04:02:18.000 --> 04:02:22.40
worried about the time because we've already pushed our primaries back from March to May.

2495
04:02:22.40 --> 04:02:26.56
They're probably going to get pushed back to June now. That's getting closer and closer to the general

2496
04:02:26.56 --> 04:02:32.48
election in November. They could in theory move that. Right. That, you know, that November election

2497
04:02:32.48 --> 04:02:37.68
day does not a hard set day. The state can choose a different day. They can push it to January.

2498
04:02:37.68 --> 04:02:43.44
But that cuts off the whole next cycle. That pushes into the next cycle. What do you do now?

2499
04:02:44.24 --> 04:02:49.36
And it were in such an uncharted territory. And I just don't have faith that the Republicans

2500
04:02:49.36 --> 04:02:55.60
right now know how to deal with this fight. And the Democrats, almost like I said, it's almost

2501
04:02:55.60 --> 04:03:01.84
like they're just trying to see what they can get away with. But they're panicking. The Democrats know

2502
04:03:02.40 --> 04:03:10.08
right what's coming in this midterms. So these new, our new districts, they are so close to any

2503
04:03:10.08 --> 04:03:15.68
other year. They would most of them be 50, 50 splits. They could go either way. They'll be swing

2504
04:03:15.68 --> 04:03:22.64
districts. But because of this anticipated red wave, they set them up. It looks more like they set

2505
04:03:22.64 --> 04:03:29.52
them up on purpose to be Republican. Very much favored Republicans. And they will certainly.

2506
04:03:29.52 --> 04:03:36.08
But the North Carolina Constitution says it is the role duty responsibility of the general assembly

2507
04:03:36.08 --> 04:03:43.68
to set the districts. So of course it's going to be partisan. Right? Because rarely, if ever,

2508
04:03:43.68 --> 04:03:50.16
is your house and Senate 50 50, right? It just doesn't happen. So there's a whole constitutional

2509
04:03:50.16 --> 04:03:56.48
battle here in state constitution. And I think people really understand how important your state

2510
04:03:56.48 --> 04:04:01.52
constitution is. Right? Like when our government was set up, it was supposed to be all these

2511
04:04:01.52 --> 04:04:08.32
states, these nations of the United States. And we've gotten away from that. The federal government

2512
04:04:08.32 --> 04:04:13.12
is gotten too big. And that's one of my big things. Like, hey, let's return that federal government

2513
04:04:13.12 --> 04:04:19.60
let's put it back in its constitutionally limited box and put the lid back on it. Because that

2514
04:04:19.60 --> 04:04:25.28
monster has climbed out of that box and gone all over the place. And I would say like, Heck, man,

2515
04:04:25.28 --> 04:04:30.80
if you could simply attempt, let's say we got a 70% solution on getting our federal government

2516
04:04:30.80 --> 04:04:38.16
back to its Constitutional limitations. We would solve over half of America's problems with the federal

2517
04:04:38.16 --> 04:04:43.76
government. Just return it to what that Constitution says. I don't know, man. I just feel like two

2518
04:04:43.76 --> 04:04:50.72
often folks up in DC, they use the Constitution to a paper instead of reading it for exactly

2519
04:04:50.72 --> 04:04:58.40
what it stated. It's it's hardbreak. And then, well, like you said, it's going to be a battle.

2520
04:04:59.68 --> 04:05:06.32
It is a battle. I know you mentioned about how what to do for people to get to help out,

2521
04:05:06.32 --> 04:05:10.72
you know, locally, where that out, how can people, I think that's probably a pretty good place to

2522
04:05:10.72 --> 04:05:14.80
wrap up because we've been going for over four hours. But if people want to support you,

2523
04:05:17.04 --> 04:05:22.000
we got Tony Cowdon dot com, right? And that's the main that is the campaign website.

2524
04:05:22.000 --> 04:05:27.12
So campaign website, you're on Instagram. You just said Tony underscore,

2525
04:05:27.12 --> 04:05:32.40
Cowdon underscore, four, a letter for or it's getting the number four. Is that a letter for?

2526
04:05:32.40 --> 04:05:38.72
No, the number four in C and then I have two Facebook pages, my personal Tony Cowdon and

2527
04:05:39.92 --> 04:05:48.32
the campaign Tony Cowdon. They're both me. All right. And then you've got a YouTube channel,

2528
04:05:48.32 --> 04:05:53.20
which I saw. Yeah, I don't you much with it. I was going to say you have one video. But you know,

2529
04:05:53.20 --> 04:05:58.24
I had it. I want to I ever know. We can only go Tony Cowdon gets after it. So I don't know. Maybe

2530
04:05:58.24 --> 04:06:03.28
tonight you're going to post for 87 videos on you. YouTube's just never been my favorite for

2531
04:06:03.28 --> 04:06:08.08
whatever reason. And I've had numerous YouTube channels, right? I've got the one right now. Like you

2532
04:06:08.08 --> 04:06:11.92
say, I was got a couple videos, maybe on it. And then like, but you know, YouTube was a big thing

2533
04:06:11.92 --> 04:06:16.56
that had to jam had lots of videos on it. And just something happened where with the whole shooting

2534
04:06:16.56 --> 04:06:24.32
gun thing, Instagram became my main platform. And as much as I don't really like social,

2535
04:06:24.32 --> 04:06:28.40
I don't like the whole idea of it. I mean, I'd much rather go back to just, you know, but

2536
04:06:28.96 --> 04:06:34.24
it seemed that at least the evolution of it all. I know if it was even by design, the Instagram page

2537
04:06:34.24 --> 04:06:40.40
was what grew and funneled me business. Whereas it was when I had the gym, Facebook,

2538
04:06:40.40 --> 04:06:45.68
it was because Facebook so local. So now I'm having to get back after Facebook because the campaign

2539
04:06:45.68 --> 04:06:51.12
is very local. But yeah, man, the reality is and this sucks, man, because I spent my entire life

2540
04:06:51.12 --> 04:06:57.76
been pretty independent, I've never had to ask anybody from money. And it's weird. The reality

2541
04:06:57.76 --> 04:07:03.68
of this whole mass and it is a mass because there needs to be campaign finance reform. The reality

2542
04:07:03.68 --> 04:07:08.88
is if the campaign is not funded, I don't get to advertise and there's no face or there's no

2543
04:07:08.88 --> 04:07:14.88
recognition, there's a name face recognition and I won't get the votes. And you know, strategically

2544
04:07:14.88 --> 04:07:20.16
speaking, you know, we're addressing, you know, fundraising, talking to donors and then there are

2545
04:07:20.16 --> 04:07:25.84
voters. And they're not always the same people. We've done really well so far the soft,

2546
04:07:25.84 --> 04:07:32.56
bro net just like you have a meal on here. Been on a bunch of different other guys and when I

2547
04:07:32.56 --> 04:07:40.000
launched that soft network man just started sharing it. And we raised a 132 grand and like 13 days

2548
04:07:40.000 --> 04:07:47.12
of our Christmas. And that's what got people going, what way, who's this dude? Where's this guy

2549
04:07:47.12 --> 04:07:53.12
coming from? And you know, there's always this, there's some contention that, oh, you're not getting

2550
04:07:53.12 --> 04:07:58.000
your funds from the district. Well, I don't know what the district is. You know how hard it is to get

2551
04:07:58.000 --> 04:08:02.40
someone to donate to your campaign, when they don't even know if you live in their district or not,

2552
04:08:03.28 --> 04:08:08.32
you think the Democrats don't know that. Of course they do, right? What they're doing is creating

2553
04:08:08.32 --> 04:08:15.84
better apathy or something or whatever. So they won't donate and they're not going to devote. It's

2554
04:08:15.84 --> 04:08:22.56
a strategy. It's not new. It's done it before. So yeah, man, this is where, you know, that's the asking

2555
04:08:22.56 --> 04:08:32.72
for money thing is hard. But here's the cool part. That $132,000, the number one donated amount was

2556
04:08:32.72 --> 04:08:42.40
$50. We had $161,500 individual donors from across the nation, all 50 states, over Christmas.

2557
04:08:42.40 --> 04:08:46.40
When people don't have extra income because they're spending on their Christmas presents,

2558
04:08:47.12 --> 04:08:54.40
donated this campaign. That's a clear signal. It should be a clear signal to folks up in DC and everywhere

2559
04:08:54.40 --> 04:09:00.08
else that the American public is tired of their shit. Excuse me, my language, but that's what it is.

2560
04:09:00.08 --> 04:09:07.52
And they want normal people, and if I follow that kind of way, that's what it is. They want real

2561
04:09:07.52 --> 04:09:14.56
people who have never sought out politics. You know, before we got on, I was checking and telling

2562
04:09:14.56 --> 04:09:22.48
you about my opponent, who's a state house rep and they call him the alcohol of

2563
04:09:23.52 --> 04:09:27.76
no killing politics because he sold out and those kind of taxpayers and sent tax dollars all around

2564
04:09:27.76 --> 04:09:34.56
the nation to invest in green energy and so on and so forth. Long story short, he didn't like it.

2565
04:09:35.36 --> 04:09:39.04
I think I might have been with Andy Stomp when I referred to him as the alcoholist.

2566
04:09:39.04 --> 04:09:43.36
No killing politics. Well, reality is that's what they call him. He's a

2567
04:09:43.36 --> 04:09:48.08
no killing a member of no killing a house and all of his contemporaries. They all calling that.

2568
04:09:48.08 --> 04:09:54.08
Right? He didn't like it. Well, the other day charged up to me and it was like,

2569
04:09:54.08 --> 04:10:00.80
you know, and ultimately I was like, hey, look man, you know, you say whatever you want,

2570
04:10:00.80 --> 04:10:07.20
but you set that money out and he told me, he told me I was an ignorant wannabe.

2571
04:10:08.64 --> 04:10:15.12
And I was like, like I said, I might be ignorant to how and why y'all do things.

2572
04:10:15.12 --> 04:10:21.68
There's dirty ass politicians. I was like, but I'm not a wannabe. Like you created me.

2573
04:10:21.68 --> 04:10:27.28
Men like you are the reason why men like me are coming for your jobs.

2574
04:10:29.12 --> 04:10:35.28
We hired you. You suck. So now we're gonna fire you. And that's about America wants right now.

2575
04:10:35.28 --> 04:10:41.28
All right. Let's clear America wants. And like I said, man, we get that JTF up there.

2576
04:10:42.56 --> 04:10:50.80
So yeah, 10 bucks. Right. 100 bucks. I mean, if you got 2900, that is the max contribution.

2577
04:10:50.80 --> 04:10:56.000
I could stand some of those because that new district's more expensive. But Southern Wake County

2578
04:10:56.000 --> 04:11:04.64
Raleigh, that advertising is, that's way more expensive. That market, right? A TV ad in Raleigh is

2579
04:11:04.64 --> 04:11:11.28
expensive. But that's what I need. I need funding. People ask, what can I do? 10 bucks. Right?

2580
04:11:12.000 --> 04:11:17.92
Don't get your Starbucks coffee today. Give me five bucks. And it's weird man asking for people

2581
04:11:17.92 --> 04:11:22.000
from money. And then I came to the conclusion, I'm not asking people to give me money. This is an

2582
04:11:22.000 --> 04:11:28.64
investment in America's future. Because I promise people I will not become a politician.

2583
04:11:29.52 --> 04:11:36.40
I would rather die than sell this nation as people out. And I put myself in that position before

2584
04:11:36.40 --> 04:11:41.60
that I would have died and almost did a couple times. I feel like I have that proven try record

2585
04:11:41.60 --> 04:11:45.92
and people are like, but there's this guy and there's this guy, he's this veteran and that

2586
04:11:45.92 --> 04:11:51.76
veteran. They went up there and they sold us out. I'm like, I'm not those guys. I'm not those guys.

2587
04:11:51.76 --> 04:11:58.24
What do you want? Here I am stepping up, help me get there. And if I turn out to be some

2588
04:11:58.24 --> 04:12:07.60
Spinalist dirt bad politician, fire me. I get involved and fire me. But I promise,

2589
04:12:07.60 --> 04:12:13.68
I'm not capable of being a dirt bad politician. It's not in my genetics. You know, it's not

2590
04:12:13.68 --> 04:12:19.76
even close to something I could ever be. You know, corporations don't have things that I want.

2591
04:12:19.76 --> 04:12:25.28
I'm not a gear guy, right? Corporations don't have things. I don't want a boat. I don't want a boat.

2592
04:12:25.28 --> 04:12:31.84
I don't want, I don't desire money. I desire experiences. That's why I like hunting. And, you know,

2593
04:12:32.72 --> 04:12:39.60
with my girlfriend, you can't sell me that. I'm not, I'm not for sale. So, yeah, man, if you got

2594
04:12:39.60 --> 04:12:43.76
a few books, Tonycombe.com, oh, I will tell you this, man. When the cool things is, when you

2595
04:12:43.76 --> 04:12:50.000
go to the website, when it pops up, there is a pop up that has a video and stuff. You can watch it.

2596
04:12:50.000 --> 04:12:55.28
It's cool videos. Let me tell you how cool I am or some shit. Just move past that. I don't understand

2597
04:12:55.28 --> 04:13:01.92
it says dirt bike price. I'm not a something from nothing type of guy. So, last year, I got this

2598
04:13:01.92 --> 04:13:06.80
here at my house that I was going to get back in the race of motorcross. So, I went and bought a brand

2599
04:13:06.80 --> 04:13:17.84
new KX4F50 rocking ship. I got an excavator and a, uh, and 63 acres. And I built a motorcross track in my backyard.

2600
04:13:19.60 --> 04:13:24.96
All that my girlfriend going, what is wrong with you? And, uh, that dirt bike,

2601
04:13:25.84 --> 04:13:30.64
spin, I got it last November. So, it's been whatever year in a few months. It still has the second

2602
04:13:30.64 --> 04:13:36.48
take a gas in it. I have a head time to ride it. So, you're going up for auction? I donated it to the

2603
04:13:36.48 --> 04:13:42.64
campaign. So, it's a raffle. It's a raffle. It's, you know, a $10,000 dirt bike. It's never been laid over.

2604
04:13:43.68 --> 04:13:50.56
I was cautious getting back into riding. So, I took it easy. Boots, helmet, nice stuff. I didn't

2605
04:13:50.56 --> 04:13:55.76
bullshit about some nice stuff. Four or five sets of riding gear, Oakley goggles, all that stuff.

2606
04:13:55.76 --> 04:14:00.88
Even by chances at it. I'm not a something for nothing type of guy. I got an AR coming on board

2607
04:14:00.88 --> 04:14:06.88
and a precision rifle, a custom precision rifle at my buddy who makes my precision guns freaking

2608
04:14:06.88 --> 04:14:11.68
building for us. So, point being is right, I'm not a something for nothing type of guy. So, if you

2609
04:14:11.68 --> 04:14:16.88
donate it, it can't pay at least you're getting a chance to win some cool stuff. So, hell yeah.

2610
04:14:18.56 --> 04:14:23.44
All right. So, echo you got anything? No, we covered it.

2611
04:14:25.04 --> 04:14:30.48
Awesome, man. Oh, yeah. Thanks for coming on, bro. No, thank you for having me. Thanks for sharing

2612
04:14:30.48 --> 04:14:37.12
your experiences. Thanks for what you've done for America in the past. Yeah. And thanks for what you

2613
04:14:37.12 --> 04:14:43.36
are about to do for America. Awesome to meet you, man. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having

2614
04:14:43.36 --> 04:14:47.52
me. This is this how we win. Absolutely. Hell yeah. Thanks, brother. Thank you.

2615
04:14:49.60 --> 04:14:58.40
And with that Tony Cowden has left the building head and back to North Kacklecki. And I failed

2616
04:14:58.40 --> 04:15:03.52
to mention, I failed to make North Kacklecki. I failed to make it look I mentioned the fact that

2617
04:15:04.16 --> 04:15:10.56
we at origin USA have a factory in Ashboro, North Carolina, which is awesome. But I failed to

2618
04:15:10.56 --> 04:15:14.88
mention. And it just like these conversations you don't know where they're going. I failed to

2619
04:15:14.88 --> 04:15:23.52
mention the fact that when I went through Buds and STT, seal tactical training and then got the

2620
04:15:23.52 --> 04:15:31.84
seal team one. And then I did three deployments. And then I was in training cell with my running

2621
04:15:31.84 --> 04:15:38.96
mate at the time, who I also he was my roommate that whole time. And he was from North Kacklecki.

2622
04:15:41.36 --> 04:15:49.28
And he's a freaking best guy. Awesome guy. And a total stud across the board, but he's super

2623
04:15:49.28 --> 04:15:57.44
good athlete, like a ridiculously good athlete. Like we had he played, this is the guy who played

2624
04:15:57.44 --> 04:16:08.32
basketball in North Carolina as a kid. And then he got drafted. He was 511. He missed a foul shot.

2625
04:16:10.24 --> 04:16:16.32
And lost like the state championship. He did that. You know. So he had he had that, but you know

2626
04:16:16.32 --> 04:16:22.000
he was still. He was in the state championship and he's obviously a key player. And he got he got

2627
04:16:22.000 --> 04:16:28.48
some he got drafted or whatever recruited to some D2D3 schools. Because he was such a good basketball

2628
04:16:28.48 --> 04:16:34.64
player. And he ended up he's like, listen, I'm not going to I'm not going to be a pro obviously. So

2629
04:16:34.64 --> 04:16:39.60
I'm going to focus on my education. So he ended up going to University of North Carolina. And while

2630
04:16:39.60 --> 04:16:47.36
he was there, he grew 5 inches. So he graduated at 6-4. And this is a guy you know you go out

2631
04:16:47.36 --> 04:16:52.40
and shoot basketball with them. And he would just sit there and hit 3 pointers all day. So then then

2632
04:16:54.000 --> 04:17:01.36
we had all the grizzard who was the navy quarterback. And who's himself a stud. That's the guy

2633
04:17:01.36 --> 04:17:06.40
who's a great friend of mine and he ended up getting murdered in Coronado, which was awful.

2634
04:17:06.40 --> 04:17:12.32
But just a stud. Just a stud across the board. I mean he played. He broke all kinds of records at

2635
04:17:12.32 --> 04:17:18.24
the Naval Academy. Just a beast. And those two guys got in a little throwing contest. Who could

2636
04:17:18.24 --> 04:17:26.000
throw a football further? And my buddy from North Kaka-Laki also played football. So I'm sitting

2637
04:17:26.000 --> 04:17:29.84
and watching because I'm not even going to participate in this competition against these two

2638
04:17:29.84 --> 04:17:37.68
freaking studs. And so they started throwing it back and forth just backing up each time.

2639
04:17:37.68 --> 04:17:44.56
Right. And yeah the kid from North Carolina. He threw it further. It was like 65 yards. So

2640
04:17:45.12 --> 04:17:52.72
you know I'm talking a wing. And just a beast man. But so whenever I hear North Carolina, I always think

2641
04:17:52.72 --> 04:17:59.28
North Kaka-Laki because that's how he had this funny look. He'd give people, you mean everybody.

2642
04:17:59.28 --> 04:18:03.76
But when you said North Carolina, if you said North Kaka-Laki, he'd give you look like of the most

2643
04:18:03.76 --> 04:18:10.000
affirming of it. You know like like that's everything. You know like you know as if you just said

2644
04:18:11.52 --> 04:18:16.56
you know chocolate peanut butter milk like that's so good. You know that's what it goes things.

2645
04:18:17.60 --> 04:18:26.64
So they get very cool to talk to Tony. And you know what's a scrap man? It's a scrap.

2646
04:18:26.64 --> 04:18:30.80
He's got to go. He's going hard in the paint you know. He's going hard in the paint.

2647
04:18:33.52 --> 04:18:38.24
He said something that was that was interesting and maybe I don't know. I don't follow

2648
04:18:39.20 --> 04:18:46.56
public politics as much as maybe others do. But he did mention something that I thought. That's

2649
04:18:46.56 --> 04:18:53.20
that's good. This is a good thing to be talking about and to be thinking about is the lack of effectiveness

2650
04:18:53.20 --> 04:18:58.24
of a linear solution. Because man that linear solution like and that just in everyday club

2651
04:18:58.24 --> 04:19:02.88
bra I don't know how to write a country. Everyone knows that. You know that about me. I don't know how to

2652
04:19:03.84 --> 04:19:12.32
but I do think that it's going to be difficult to make decisions for what 300 million people or

2653
04:19:12.32 --> 04:19:17.44
whatever. You know what's in the best interest for three. It's that's hard. I understand. But if you

2654
04:19:17.44 --> 04:19:21.44
kind of simply down on whatever let's say I don't know for example your kids. Right?

2655
04:19:21.44 --> 04:19:27.92
If you start implementing linear solutions with your kids so the kids, no, no, no, crying. They want

2656
04:19:27.92 --> 04:19:33.68
a soda. So to pop. Give them the soda. That's the lead solution. Yeah, they're crying. They're

2657
04:19:33.68 --> 04:19:38.08
unhappy obviously because they're crying and whatever. What's the linear solution exactly?

2658
04:19:38.08 --> 04:19:42.48
They're right. Give them the soda. But that causes all kinds of other problems. A lot of them too

2659
04:19:42.48 --> 04:19:48.24
by the way. Not just one another problem. It's like a bunch of other problems. So to imagine it be

2660
04:19:48.24 --> 04:19:55.12
that same formula except times a million with running the country and whatever way. So it's like,

2661
04:19:55.12 --> 04:20:00.80
yeah, to focus on that concept where it's like, okay, sure this will be a linear solution or understanding,

2662
04:20:00.80 --> 04:20:05.76
okay, that's a solution. That's a linear solution. Understand what would happen then and he kept saying,

2663
04:20:05.76 --> 04:20:10.000
and then what? Right? Just to be paying attention to that stuff, I think that's a good thing. They're

2664
04:20:10.000 --> 04:20:14.80
good move. And I'm not saying no one else pays attention to that but that's not like any kind of front

2665
04:20:14.80 --> 04:20:19.20
running concept that people are kind of pushing. You know, doesn't seem like it is. Yeah.

2666
04:20:19.20 --> 04:20:25.12
And I don't know, but I liked it. Well, if you can lend some support to Tony, this look,

2667
04:20:25.92 --> 04:20:31.76
you might not agree with them on every topic that there is. Maybe you see some things a little bit

2668
04:20:31.76 --> 04:20:39.84
differently than you. But the guy's character and just the fact that he's going to go up there and

2669
04:20:39.84 --> 04:20:50.64
live in his room and make things happen. Help him out if you can. If you want to help out yourself,

2670
04:20:50.64 --> 04:20:55.92
a little bit too speaking of origin, USA, we have a factory in North Carolina,

2671
04:20:56.56 --> 04:20:59.68
kind of two factories right now, which we're consolidating. We have factories up in Maine,

2672
04:20:59.68 --> 04:21:03.12
we're build stuff in America. Look, here's something else you can do to support America.

2673
04:21:03.12 --> 04:21:09.28
You want to help America by American, by American. You need a pair of boots,

2674
04:21:09.28 --> 04:21:13.52
by American, because you need a pair of jeans, by American pair of jeans.

2675
04:21:13.52 --> 04:21:19.52
But have you ever heard of Jake Tran? Okay. So maybe I maybe have he, what he does is he kind of breaks

2676
04:21:19.52 --> 04:21:24.40
down things that have to do with like money and power and he makes these cool YouTube videos.

2677
04:21:24.40 --> 04:21:32.88
Okay. New Jake Tran. So, one of them, one of his recent ones were fashion, like the evil fashion

2678
04:21:32.88 --> 04:21:39.52
industry. And that's what he was talking to be talk about like how basically fashion is built by slavery,

2679
04:21:39.52 --> 04:21:43.12
you know, their countries. Oh, for sure. So if you've not been listening to me for the past

2680
04:21:43.12 --> 04:21:48.56
freaking years, I have and mainly just what he had here from Jake Tran.

2681
04:21:48.56 --> 04:21:53.76
But Jake Tran, the way he breaks up, he did it better than me. I got it. I love you.

2682
04:21:53.76 --> 04:21:58.16
You were the man. But in this one, he did a really, really good job. Well,

2683
04:21:58.16 --> 04:22:02.72
maybe if I had someone that I worked with that could put together videos that kind of extended

2684
04:22:02.72 --> 04:22:06.88
the things that I were saying, maybe that would have worked out better. I don't know. You know what?

2685
04:22:06.88 --> 04:22:10.08
You make a good point. You make a good point. It's my fault for not finding someone that was

2686
04:22:10.08 --> 04:22:17.76
more effective than me in social media and media arts. Again, great point. But the way he does it,

2687
04:22:17.76 --> 04:22:22.56
is he does it in terms of like, like, you're the evil one and he's talking to you goes,

2688
04:22:22.56 --> 04:22:26.96
all you have to do is just get some slaves and like he'll talk to, that's how he'll make it.

2689
04:22:26.96 --> 04:22:31.84
It's not just easy to do that all the time. That's it. Yeah. It's kind of sarcastic, but kind of like,

2690
04:22:33.68 --> 04:22:39.60
when he'll come and act you a little bit, yeah, he's coming at your sinister side almost. Like in

2691
04:22:39.60 --> 04:22:43.12
certain ones, it's more heavy than others, but then he'll be like, what's the heaviest one?

2692
04:22:45.68 --> 04:22:51.04
This one was so heavy, it made me consider actually doing it. But at the end of the day, when

2693
04:22:51.04 --> 04:22:53.68
you stop the YouTube video, you're like, probably I'm not going to do that. You know, anyway,

2694
04:22:53.68 --> 04:22:59.04
want about charities, like how charities can defraud the government or something like that.

2695
04:22:59.04 --> 04:23:03.52
And we'll like, oh, he'll say, you can do this and this with no strings attached, of course,

2696
04:23:03.52 --> 04:23:07.92
and then he'll keep talking and you're like, see what he did there. So you're going to start

2697
04:23:07.92 --> 04:23:12.88
a charity to defraud the government. Is that what you were saying? You don't want to do it?

2698
04:23:12.88 --> 04:23:16.40
It's not what it's about, but I'm saying what you watch the video, you're like,

2699
04:23:16.40 --> 04:23:21.04
that's actually not a bad idea. You know, it's like that kind of thoughts, but it's the way he says it,

2700
04:23:21.04 --> 04:23:25.60
though. I'm going to do one YouTube video away from being sinister and ripping people off.

2701
04:23:25.60 --> 04:23:32.72
Yeah, this worked to it, but anyway, what's that one about the freaking fashion industry? You're

2702
04:23:32.72 --> 04:23:36.32
going to be like, probably, yeah, that's it. And I get what you're saying when you're like,

2703
04:23:36.32 --> 04:23:38.96
that's what you've been saying. That's what's up. I've been saying it,

2704
04:23:38.96 --> 04:23:43.20
effectively enough for you to understand it, apparently. No, no, I understand it, but he like,

2705
04:23:43.76 --> 04:23:48.32
it's about a job. Okay, I'm going to watch him. We'll get the message right. I'll get the

2706
04:23:48.32 --> 04:23:55.28
message right. So people that we'll understand that when you buy some fashion crop that's made

2707
04:23:55.28 --> 04:24:01.52
overseas, it was made by slaves. That's what's happening. You remember that one building in

2708
04:24:01.52 --> 04:24:05.92
I forget where it was, but where it collapsed on all the, all the workers. So he starts off like

2709
04:24:05.92 --> 04:24:11.92
with that and like just all these, yeah, it's crazy. And then a lot of it, it's all essentially like

2710
04:24:11.92 --> 04:24:17.76
borderline free stuff. Like this. As far as how it was made. Yeah. So so much of it just goes to the

2711
04:24:17.76 --> 04:24:23.20
trash so much of it. So they're just, yeah, who cares, kids? Whatever. That's why you see some of

2712
04:24:23.20 --> 04:24:28.000
those, those, those high-fashion companies will take their surplus and just burn it,

2713
04:24:28.000 --> 04:24:36.40
because they want to keep the supply low. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they misread the next fall season.

2714
04:24:36.40 --> 04:24:42.40
Or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. And so they got to burn it. So let's not support that. Let's support

2715
04:24:42.40 --> 04:24:51.12
freedom. Yeah. Let's support America. Let's support origin USA, origin USA dot com. Also,

2716
04:24:51.12 --> 04:24:56.72
you get yourself some jockel fuel. I mean, let's face it. You're going to have some,

2717
04:24:57.76 --> 04:25:04.000
you know, whatever. Injuries, soreness. Soreness. Yeah. For sure. What's the between muscle

2718
04:25:04.000 --> 04:25:08.24
soreness and like when you have a joint soreness? Well, do what do you call it when you're,

2719
04:25:08.24 --> 04:25:13.68
if you did, let's say you did weighted dip sister day? Sure. I put that in. See, weighted dips

2720
04:25:13.68 --> 04:25:20.64
every time I do weighted dips. I feel like a little bit of not just sorness in my triceps and chest,

2721
04:25:20.64 --> 04:25:26.32
but I have a little bit of what is that called in my shoulders themselves? Yeah. Like joint pain.

2722
04:25:26.32 --> 04:25:30.96
Yeah. Like a little bit, but it's minor. Right. Right. I joined agrofession. Yeah. It's like I think a

2723
04:25:30.96 --> 04:25:35.36
lot of the times they don't come obviously from like certain nutritional elements. And

2724
04:25:35.36 --> 04:25:43.76
could be past injuries as well. But a lot of them, it's imbalances in certain places.

2725
04:25:43.76 --> 04:25:49.12
You know, so you kind of overstretch understretch certain things and whatever. But when you have

2726
04:25:49.12 --> 04:25:54.000
joint agrovation, sure, you can take like during orifer. If you have muscle soreness,

2727
04:25:54.000 --> 04:25:58.56
you can take milk. Yep. And these are nutritional elements that can improve that are going

2728
04:25:58.56 --> 04:26:00.96
to improve these. That are going to improve these. That are those. Unfortunate scenarios.

2729
04:26:00.96 --> 04:26:04.48
And kind of fortunate because at least you were able to do them. Exactly. You were able to get

2730
04:26:04.48 --> 04:26:09.36
after it. And it's part of the game. So I learned early on and I was okay. So I make my daughter

2731
04:26:09.36 --> 04:26:15.60
do little workouts. Sometimes it's punishment. Sometimes it's just what we're doing. And she's eight.

2732
04:26:15.60 --> 04:26:21.52
So Dom's delayed onset muscle sort of is new to her. So when you're new to Dom's, you're like,

2733
04:26:21.52 --> 04:26:25.12
I don't like this feeling. Like why would I do push-ups or why would I do a bunch of squats when

2734
04:26:25.12 --> 04:26:29.20
my legs are going to feel like this the next day? It's like you feel like your body's kind of

2735
04:26:29.20 --> 04:26:34.88
being destroyed or whatever. But when you really understand what Dom's is, you kind of invite it.

2736
04:26:34.88 --> 04:26:39.12
So I understood the value of Dom's early on. I think I was like 10 or 11 years old.

2737
04:26:40.96 --> 04:26:44.96
From reading about it or just understanding that, I want how yesterday I'm sore because I'm

2738
04:26:44.96 --> 04:26:50.16
getting straw or, yes. So I found out I forget how I found out this is, you know, whatever,

2739
04:26:50.16 --> 04:26:57.12
1980, 80, whatever, however old or whatever year. But I knew that your muscles were sore because they were

2740
04:26:57.12 --> 04:27:03.20
triggered into like growing back big or whatever. So I'm like, oh shoot. So if I do a bunch of push-ups

2741
04:27:04.08 --> 04:27:07.60
and I'm not sore, I'm like dang, I didn't do enough push-ups. Or if I ran a bunch, like when I

2742
04:27:07.60 --> 04:27:11.76
started, when you, you know the first two days of football practice, you get sore, like your

2743
04:27:11.76 --> 04:27:14.96
sore, your legs are sore, your abs are sore from doing sit-ups, your next are all this stuff.

2744
04:27:15.60 --> 04:27:20.16
But I knew that, no, that's because they're about to grow back bigger. You kind of invite it.

2745
04:27:20.16 --> 04:27:24.32
So now as an adult I understand, hey man, that Dom's life is part of the part of the thing

2746
04:27:24.32 --> 04:27:29.04
payment. Yeah, I can say. But you can mitigate it, you can mitigate it. Not by working out the last,

2747
04:27:29.04 --> 04:27:34.24
so working out weaker. Oh no, no, no, no, no. But eating the correct food. Yeah, you're facilitating

2748
04:27:34.24 --> 04:27:42.40
the whole Dom's process right there. So all that stuff, jockelfuel.com plus you can get the drinks out

2749
04:27:42.40 --> 04:27:46.88
wall-aw-aw. Which by the way, we're kind of dominating a wall-aw. If you go out and you buy stuff from

2750
04:27:46.88 --> 04:27:52.000
wall-aw-aw, I am personally thinking you at this time for making us dominate wall-aw. Don't let

2751
04:27:52.000 --> 04:27:57.36
up. Clear shelves going there, get an after it. We're working with a bunch of other companies. We are,

2752
04:27:57.36 --> 04:28:04.48
I got to put together a list of where you can buy jockelfuel. But right now, I can tell you,

2753
04:28:04.48 --> 04:28:09.76
you can get it out wall-aw-aw, the drinks and you can get it at the vitamin shop. So, or you can

2754
04:28:09.76 --> 04:28:15.60
get it at jockelfuel.com. Yeah, we drink kombucha. I don't like it. Me neither. And that's kind of the

2755
04:28:15.60 --> 04:28:21.20
thing where you know like, you know, drinks kombucha, all the females in my family. Yeah,

2756
04:28:21.20 --> 04:28:26.16
drinking that stuff like, it's method, fed of me or something. It would teach their own,

2757
04:28:26.16 --> 04:28:30.40
not during the method, fed of me, but like it's a very big, like something that they're enjoying. You're

2758
04:28:30.40 --> 04:28:38.24
here good thing. Yeah. Okay. No hype it up. Anyways, let me retract that. My wife and daughters

2759
04:28:38.24 --> 04:28:44.56
like kombucha for whatever reason. Yes. I think it tastes like crap. Like crap, yes, sir. And I'm not

2760
04:28:44.56 --> 04:28:48.56
even a guy. My father-in-law, he makes his own kombucha. Oh, yeah. So it was like, dang, okay,

2761
04:28:48.56 --> 04:28:53.04
obviously great for you. Good enough for you. There was a dude that made kombucha with jockel

2762
04:28:53.04 --> 04:28:58.08
white tea, by the way. Oh, okay. He was selling it. Combat kombucha. I don't know what happened to it.

2763
04:28:58.08 --> 04:29:01.68
He went out there's making combat kombucha kombucha kombucha.

2764
04:29:01.68 --> 04:29:05.20
That's all, that's all. That's all the deal. All right. Are you going to say it? Either way,

2765
04:29:05.20 --> 04:29:09.04
the point of, okay, do you have any vegetables that you just like, you know, okay, they're good for

2766
04:29:09.04 --> 04:29:13.44
you, but perhaps not going to eat that because I'm just not into it. Into the taste or whatever,

2767
04:29:13.44 --> 04:29:18.16
just not like, um, a sparrig. Yes. You know, people like a sparrig is just ulting up nice.

2768
04:29:18.16 --> 04:29:23.60
I, I think it tastes kind of junk. So I'm not going to be excited for a sparrig. Okay.

2769
04:29:23.60 --> 04:29:29.20
So the good thing and this is why I think a lot of most people like this energy drink,

2770
04:29:29.20 --> 04:29:33.36
because when you drink it and you have no guilt, you know that it's actually good for you. It's not

2771
04:29:33.36 --> 04:29:37.92
like a sparrig. It's seem seen. Well, a sparrig is good for you, but it tastes bad. Yes.

2772
04:29:38.64 --> 04:29:44.48
Discipline go is good for you. And it tastes good. That's bonus. Exactly right. And I think people like it.

2773
04:29:44.48 --> 04:29:50.32
Especially the mango one. By the way, I hear great things about the mango. Check. If you want to get

2776
04:30:03.76 --> 04:30:09.84
I created mentally and then you have brought to fruition. I think it's going to be a classic.

2777
04:30:09.84 --> 04:30:14.88
Yeah, I think it's going to be a classic. So good one. And that one is the March

2778
04:30:15.36 --> 04:30:20.32
March shirt. Okay. And it's pretty square away. The shirt locker is the membership. Did you make the

2779
04:30:20.32 --> 04:30:25.60
adjustments you need to make to that shirt as directed? No time. No time. No time. It didn't have time. It was

2780
04:30:25.60 --> 04:30:34.48
already. Hey, what do you call? To ship a field. Overcome by events. Yeah. Well, that look. We're good. This

2781
04:30:34.48 --> 04:30:40.16

2829
04:35:26.16 --> 04:35:31.68
Thanks for everything that he's done. You know, we barely even you can't spend. What is it?

2830
04:35:31.68 --> 04:35:38.48
Eight or nine years in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The amount of stuff that he's been through that

2831
04:35:38.48 --> 04:35:42.72
he's done, the amount of risk he's taken to serve our country. You're not going to cover it in a four-hour

2832
04:35:42.72 --> 04:35:47.52
podcast or a 20-hour podcast or a hundred-hour podcast. But that's the kind of person that's been

2833
04:35:47.52 --> 04:35:53.52
out there laying his life on the line for the country. Now he's stepping up again. So support him if you can.

2834
04:35:54.80 --> 04:36:00.56
And thanks for coming, Tony. And the rest of our American military out there.

2835
04:36:00.56 --> 04:36:07.76
And the veterans, thank you all for what you've done and continue to do to serve our great

2836
04:36:07.76 --> 04:36:12.72
nation and to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2837
04:36:12.72 --> 04:36:18.16
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders. Thank you for keeping

2838
04:36:18.16 --> 04:36:25.52
us safe on the home front and to everyone else. How much can you do?

2839
04:36:25.52 --> 04:36:34.96
I actually know the answer to that question. More. That's how much you can do. You can do more.

2840
04:36:34.96 --> 04:36:42.16
And a guy like Tony makes that obvious. But it isn't going to knock on your door.

2841
04:36:44.000 --> 04:36:51.44
You have to kick that door in. You have to make things happen. You have to initiate action

2842
04:36:51.44 --> 04:36:57.20
and you do that by going out there every day and getting after it.

2843
04:36:57.20 --> 04:37:18.64
Until next time, Zekko and Joko out.
