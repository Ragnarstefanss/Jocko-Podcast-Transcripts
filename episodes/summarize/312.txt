so We really focused heavily on land nav with a map, you know planning drawing lines on a map and being able to hit that target Even if your systems go down and that's hard to do because especially when you start relying on the technology because then you It's like getting over here today, you know, I mean to think about where I was going I hit Uber Put the address in you know, I didn't even know how long it would take until I I'd punched all that stuff in But if you rely too heavily on that you know and things really matter like you know getting Getting soft operators on a target you got to be able to do it no matter what so there's a lot of a lot of focus on that manual stuff and Some people just aren't very adept at that But you know for Donovan and I want to clock in the morning flying on this mission with two Apache's to go down the Rio Hado to support this airfield seizure I mean we're sort of in disbelief, you know because how many times you get spun up and spun that you know They were gonna go we're gonna go and then we're not going and then that 2000 pound bomb goes off at Precisely one a. You know we all bash our our our the other services, you know There are no engineers good as us, but I will give the Air Force credit that bomb hit Precisely at one o'clock in the morning and it was a pretty big splash I mean 2000 pound bomb makes a heck of a flash in the middle of night We're in close Trying to take on people that you can't see There's a lot of ways to shoot a helicopter down and unfortunately this little bird got shot down a couple of days later Both pilots were killed, but but overall Just an incredible mission and you know ultimately we do end up getting men one or yaga and He gets flown out actually by Cliff Walcott who was flying with Jonathan Briley and Somalia when he lost his life So they were all one you know just one band of brothers, you know and Being able to participate and knows kind of ops and I actually ended up supporting Seals On the on the Colone side that was that was my mission we were You know trying to find Noria. Once you got over to To the 160 of so I actually ended up being in the first formal green platoon that the unit ever did before my class You'd basically just get assigned to a company and then your green platoon was Informal just did kind of the same things, but it wasn't a dedicated class and You know model somewhat after buds and some of the other training courses the unit realized We need a we need a dedicated course to get people through because there's too much of a burden on the unit The unit needs to be focused on executing you know missions and training the The the unit level the training of new people should be done by a dedicated training organization So they created this you know green platoon as it's called now and it includes you know all the typical stuff You kind of you know you say this in the book here those first few minutes of capture critical don't piss off your captors So you went into like the sear mode Instinctively right there at the crash site and you know it wasn't like You know, I made this conscious decision, you know the game is different now. and when I first got that assignment I'm like MetaVac You know, I don't want to go fly MetaVac I want to be you know in the 101st or You know one of the real you know go to war kind of units, but in the end Being in MetaVac was the best of time when I could get because you're by yourself You're you're constantly flying single ship missions I mean that decision was made in the moment and you don't know You know that the receivers gonna fall because he slipped on a Just like piece of grass, you know you're making a decision based on what you know at the time and and I would never criticize General Garrison for making that call But And I had to go back and and start the training you know things were starting to wind down I think Noria had been located and that the number of direct action missions was was scaling back You know we had control of the whole country so there wasn't any need to really You know keep flying as many missions that we had been flying so the commander decided hey go back Teach Green poll two and so I was only there Probably a week I mean you know to get all that done in a week that's why I say If there was something that I could be known for I wish it was that mission because it really was amazing I want people to listen to me and I want things to be an order So what better way to to make that happen than to join the military becoming officer people have to listen to me And things will be an order and And then inside the military as we know if I never go into combat and all I have to do is Keep the keep the the the the uniform squared away and keep my area clean I'm gonna get promoted because I'm gonna run things like an authoritarian now I'm horrible in combat because I can't control everything and it drives me crazy and I freak out But it attracts that kind of person and then you know Just as you were talking about being in the government and being in a being in a position where you're in control of things It can unfortunately attract the same kind of deranged of Foritarians that want to go in there and control everything but but they really don't I mean you look at some of the dialogue going on right now about Ukraine, you know some Our congressman said yesterday, you know, we would use nuclear weapons These people don't know what they're talking about you know Yeah, it was impossible We probably could have orbited for 20 minutes and would have not had full situation awareness Would you gotta have because I mean You know the the the the fratricide is not acceptable no matter what I mean and when that was our biggest concern So you go down Fast forward I woke up in the silence of my own grave at least that's what I believed in that first moment because the last flash of Consciousness I had clearly seen the clawing hand of the grim reaper I did not know where I was I did not know who I was it was like emerging from an altitude chamber with a case of Hypocce as my mind begin to stagger slowly through the dark dark and hallways of my concussed brain When my eyelids finally flooded open You know because we did a management meeting Over the phone over teams we do a a bi-weekly Where we just get everybody at the speed on what's going on and and you know is all about just simplifying the message You know because if you think about it from a Worker at the point of the spear is perspective that really helps You know that that's where the message needs to resonate and if I might understand it or the legal guy may understand it They just hadn't done it, you know, but you know, but you know To hear your perspective on you know battle hardened Convention on units out there kicking ass just like everybody else. Yeah, makes us think of you know how good we have it you know like like Mike Durant pointed out you know You'd meet the families and realize Well if it wasn't for them he wouldn't be here. Why I started the business I didn't want to sit on my porch at 75 thinking what if you know You got to you got to take the leap you got to you know take the chance right at these edge of what you're comfortable with and I'm you know succeed or fail. and I I didn't go right away Because I wasn't sure and what's this gonna feel like you know, I'm gonna watch my friends Essentially die on screen It actually seemed Fake to me because the rafters so it didn't have the emotional impact that I thought it might have For me and once it was over though because like I said that you know black-hawk down The credits are rolling and then you go from that bird to a Huey Right, did you think you were in nom when you're flying the Huey actually it feels like you get in the space shuttle I mean because you know It's like a maybe you get into a Ferrari if you drive a Toyota every day You know, I mean just seems very advanced. And then good you know sometimes things in life happen and they end up being good even though It's not what you wanted to have happened, but I got more experience Went to the instructor pilot course, you know got a bunch of night vision goggle time all things It really helped before you make that leap to the to the soft world and so then you spend that time at the hundred first and your your Are you figuring out more about the night stalkers at this time you learn and more? I really do you know on it again it goes back to just The stuff you learn as a kid, you know you treat others the way you want to be treated you You don't act like a jerk, you know that they're Muslim and when it was prior time I was respectful And you know the more you fly around an area the more familiar you get so you're more likely to get on target the way you need to so all that combined meant we were flying just about every day and every night Going into three October when you how often would you conduct an actual mission like a hit So October third is is my eighth Real op in six weeks how often were the guys getting contacted on these previous operations like enemy contact firefight Someone it started to ramp up you know on the first couple nothing because we had the element of surprise and When I when I had that moment on the beach I said I'm getting this going again People don't realize now, you know everything we do is on our phone on you know Go log in the internet back then and you're filling out forms and you know making copies and and Putting it in an envelope so it was a it was a little bit of an adventure applying for flight school from overseas so you know we were all Now the grat I know something the ground guys don't like it a lot You know I wasn't there on the ground. And one thing I didn't know is that I was actually taken by a rival clan and Mark Bowden is the one who did Discovers this when he writes black-hawked out Of course this is according to Somalis I don't know if it's true or not but it makes sense if you think about the dynamics of those few few hours Because I did get moved a couple times and the characters did change so it's it's very likely I was in fact You know basically stole and by a rival plan and then the go-shaded to get back to the hobby of getter clan If it's not bizarre enough You get chained up I mean you know a true start-up like that in the defense contracting world is very difficult I mean most fail because it takes a long time to get contracts and if you have no past performance then You know why is anyone gonna give you any work? It's all about respect It's all about you know keeping it simple all those things that you know if you've come up from that part of the the ecosystem Maybe come natural to you by the way Doug Brown you reminded me when you said about your commander who told you about You know Where the quiet professionals not the sound professionals he is and he may he probably doesn't remember that and and And wouldn't likely deny it And I'm thinking yeah, all right this speed bump, you know, I mean we'll get through this we just got to clean this up Never in my wildest dreams would have thought that you know Cliff and Donovan had already been killed or the things that were going on on the ground The fatalities that already been taken There wasn't a lot of talk about losses yet on the radio that I did I had heard anyway and I certainly like I had You know my gut in knots because Like you when I joined like you didn't talk about being in this hill teams for damn sure One of one of my admiral friends helped me out get through that and you know He said hey we're supposed to be quiet professionals It's just sort of It just happened natural you know it didn't became obvious the fight was over you know, I mean I got There's nothing I can do and now I'm in their hands so I got a river to what they taught me To survive a situation like this and most of it actually worked pretty well and surprising and I've gannistered I couldn't have done I'd have been asking them to drop me off somewhere in the mountains halfway through You know because by back it just I can't sit that long not not in those seats so it was hard because I knew You know the things that have gone on in this way as just you know you personally experience in the last 20 years You can't even begin to describe it all. you know big part of why he won is He's he's a fresh face with a new idea and real world experience It's the same thing Tommy Tuberville our current senator who I would serve with Coach of Auburn football, you know, it's the same thing Never been above addition before I think initially when he announced people were like Coach T I mean I don't know if it was super hard that the The hard part actually came in flight school a lot of people washed out or or You know again, they're trying to get certain numbers through so like our class started with 80 and we ended up graduating 40 now They didn't all get washed out, but they got pushed back to other classes. And he's not even hitting the target so I see you've making me more furious But in the end, you know no damage done There there's some speculation that they were actually decoys I don't know if you're gonna mention that later, but which it didn't really matter I mean, no we want to blow the shit out of this day no matter whether it's a decoy or not and that was a long flight haul I mean that that was a painful flight haul So you know I think as long as you Understand the risks you understand You know when when it gets near the end the negative ads are gonna come I mean people are gonna bash you on social media You can't avoid it. and And then of course that happens again when I ultimately end up in the blackhawk, but you know each each leap forward is You know there's a lot more systems to know and a lot more gauges So that's Master Sergeant Gordon Gary Gordon you know Received a metal of honor For his actions that day and also Sergeant first class sugar And both those guys you know when you read their their citations They requested Multiple times to be able to go in to your position and Try and help the situation that was on the ground They got the Nied they got the Nied and finally they got permission to go in and do whatever they could So you know just you just got to stay moving and Staying strong is the key to a back issue no question, but you know I already know But when we were we were lucky enough to be in those situations where I mean I was just working side by side with those guys And and there was just no doubt in there in their professionalism in their bravery and it was it An honor to be able to serve alongside them and not even just active duty army and Marine Corps, but you know when we got to Ramadi in 2006 it was a national guard national guard on the ground and they were they were Doing an incredible job taking the fight to the enemy and and they you know I told Colonel Gronski he came on this podcast 100% my some of my guys are alive because the lessons that we learned from the national guard when we showed up there I mean he he was a cober guy and He just you know from the moment he started flying black cocks I think I got a figure out a put guns on this thing You know this is a waste of my time I'll use that right you know that that in some cases they acted like I mean there's no question about it one of the One of the guest most critical points most painful points for you Was when they show up with a video camera and you kind of talk about in the book, you know your your knowledge and recollection of those type of situations occurring in Vietnam in the go for and I rack I mean you know that you know the unit you're with There's the unit that's gonna get called upon to rescue people and situations like me and you never know I mean could have saved my leg because you know open compound femur fracture and a nasty crap all like that is The chance of infection is really high and I never got infected so kind of amazing It's just it's just I don't know it's hard it's hard to It's hard to describe if you haven't lived it, you know, to see the impact that that has and then then you come back and you see their families You know, we're still in touch. and we just didn't know because we'd never flown long long missions with it before We'd always crank up turn it on go shoot work fine, but if you flew for two hours it overheated and didn't work anymore Eventually you guys did get a scud they talk about that in there You talk about that in there the war ended Over pretty quick obviously, but at the same time, you know much like in Panama Yeah, sometimes if your magazines are messed up like they won't feed properly You know I hadn't thought about that maybe just the impact itself You know Dislauged the bullets or something or messed up the spraying or who knows what MP-fives are so reliable I've shot thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds and sometimes we would just purposely not clean them to see if they would ever jam They didn't ever would jam a bet your weapon got jacked up So you don't have to feel guilty about your drone instructors. I mean Where things go south on a deed is when he starts stealing all the food that's there from the relief organization You know that's where he kind of loses my vote but before then you know leading the the overthrow of What was described as a pretty difficult prior government he's a hero and This is what Mohammed gate is telling you about he's telling you what the history of samallia and now he's a great man He led his people to freedom and we really got this all wrong. I really appreciate how Complimentary you you were in extreme ownership about the conventional army units that you work with because you know a lot of times We at least in my era there wasn't a lot of combat experience so for us the special ops guys Kind of looked down on those and that was wrong and I I always felt you know after the fact that there was Immatured on my part to kind of look at them that way because they just didn't have the experience. so like you're gonna be like it's gonna be on your mind way more and Underway more circumstances as opposed to like you never like okay, so a lot of times you can be like oh, I mean obviously all of us in the special operations community read that book You know when it came out and try to get the lessons earned and and definitely thought that it was You know, I mean I thought it was a great book I wrote them A fiction story It's available right now check it out final spin leadership strategy tactics field manual The code devaluation that protocols discipline because freedom field manual Wait, the warrior kid one two three and four get that freaking book for all the kids you know get all those books for all the kids you know for Christmas That's my recommendation I wish I could Could get those books to every kid So please help me because those books will help those kids also got Mike in the dragons We have about face by current David Hackworth. but it just got me a little bit more experience in the corporate world than then 2008 I was working for a publicly traded company and you know I know you've worked with a lot of different companies, but in terms of culture the the biggest Disconnect for me personally as a former special ops guy is a publicly traded company because it's It's all about the profits. and then It starts to fade and and that's all that's the only thing I can come up with is that I was actually fairly close to where the ground Convoy or a ground convoy I think you know because there was a couple of different efforts involved there and in getting to the target side on the ground And just kind of demoralizing when it just starts to fade away in the distance and you've been shot where you got shot in the arm I did yep, it was super super Professional like all the shooting is gone on.
