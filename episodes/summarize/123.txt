okay I wasn't thinking but you could think that again that I didn't know what in order to drink this you could just gotta get like you just gotta grit your teeth and get song potentially like hey if that happens it happens kind of like if it's not like if it's not like I don't feel that way because the reality is when supplements taste like crap you don't eat it and so we have to be cognizant of the fact that you know there's we have to consistently remember that we are all always gonna be human we're always gonna be uncomfortable change most most people like regimented schedules they like to get up a certain time like a drink certain thing eat a certain thing workout a certain time go to lunch a certain time by nature all of us hate change anyone who's in a company that goes through a big transnis for a big change you know what I'm talking about but we always have to remember that just like in the Marines we always say temper gumby the more comfortable you get being uncomfortable the happier so it's a stereotype like in at work can I thought he meant maybe like out at the club or whatever like you know need seals tend to be more into you know what's funny is you know who made a joke about this Tim Kennedy we were here we were recording the podcast Tim Kennedy was literally doing a photo shoot and he was like he's got long hair and he was like I was just thinking like it's a little much but thank you you know and that was what it was like you know who the hell I'm on to take away from there right to honor their brother and like you know who am I to do that there's just showing love all the way not halfway and so of course me being me at the time I didn't look at it that way I was just like I'm naked in front of everyone type feeling I'm just uncomfortable right now so I ended up leaving Germany and I was only there for you know what even there a full day before they send me to Bethesda and I I lent because my family was supposed to meet me a Germany but the turnaround was so fast that you know the Marines right now we're just gonna send you Bethesda and I got to Bethesda and man those flights both flights from my rack of Jeremy Germany to Bethesda every little like bit of turbulence every little bump every little movement was like being blown up all over again it was narlie because your your body was under it was in so much pain it was just I'd never puked so much because of pain in my life and it was one of those things where I was again every little jar every movement was just like yours human is the gum like there's nothing special about when you when you were in the stereotype as I moved into leadership positions and I would hear that stereotype I realized it was a real thing and that that real thing wasn't it wasn't funny it wasn't funny because when you when you eat a meta a Marine Corps battalion commander and you have long hair your uniform doesn't look right or you meet an army battalion commander or an army brigade commander or a senior or a gunney sergeant or a company first sergeant when you meet one of them somebody that's been in the Marine Corps for 23 years and you can't put on and blouse your your pants and your boots it doesn't matter how good you are in the field they're looking at you and thinking oh this guy can't even blouse boots I don't want him around that's so that stereotype even though it had definitely was rooted in truth like hey man when we got to her body everyone had shape heads everyone had square away uniforms didn't allow patches we talked about them before you know we we had guys like if we could we put a whole element in army camouflage uniform so ace use they just look like army sir but it was blown up and over to the right and second view of what affected but the guys are not too mean at this point I'm back to telling God like a man just remember our deal remember our deal and the guys are okay shit we got your bro we got you you know we got you hanged tough and how to know where I was able to take a breath and the first thing I said was developed 360 there like the door to my room opens I knew whoever was about to walk in the door like I just felt like a a spiritual presence like I just felt I knew whoever that was was a person of faith like personally got knew it knew no doubt about it felt it when the door opened the dude comes around the corner and introduce himself and it's the base chaplain and I was like okay it usually means like by this guy has no shame like he's kind of like he's he has his moral standards maybe kind of low something like that right in white no shame means don't be shy so like in South Africa when I was in South Africa they say shame and I'm facing the nurse's station when I come out in the door shuts and I just completely and utterly broke down to the point of anger like I was I was sobbing in the angry I was so angry seeing him that way and seeing and I just like just yell like those bastards like what you know what why what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing what are we gonna do about that so and on the way I can see the load master mouth to one of the other one of the other crewman we're about to fly around a tornado I read his lips and I'm like hey god like come on man throw a dude a bone like we're about I'm gonna survive all the stuff I've survived and if you let me get taken out by a tornado like we're gonna be fighting this bullshit and I went back there and started that process man and let me tell you something I consider and tell you a conviction I know why addicts they addicts because that slow withdrawal process of getting clean I mean this whole heartedly I don't know what was harder being blown up or getting clean I honestly don't know what was harder because I mean hell coming off the drugs they gave you drugs to help you come off the drugs and it's like I just you know what the frick it didn't there shot or something you can give me and I can get the hell out of here oh if we rolled out all the stereotypes for the services like marines dumb jarhead uh crayon the crayon thing that's the big marine core one what crayon crayon either yeah crayons that's like legit thing the the army's got there you know who the things and you know we don't have that kind of all that kind of thing going on uh green braise and then be willing to lower your wall and talk about the real shit you know then we have stay the course which is that's a traditional therapy that's the this is the you can't be holiday non-traditional stay the course is very traditional it's the one-on-one therapy with the warrior first owner his or her family and listen the reason that that was an attractive approach was because if you look back on what is the most successful outcome measures as far as therapy goes and as far as treating matters of the mind that has the best track record the one-on-one I think everyone on the spin and ballicator I should talk to professional way the least once a month every single person and I'm saying that is the guy that I would I would launch my piss bottle in the hospital that wanted to come in my room now I'm telling you right now I wish I had started that a long time ago because it would have saved me from a lot of shit I've had to do with because I let my pride win that's it I mean don't be afraid to say what it is we started a thing called the Brave Program which is women's specific because believe it or not neither sex knows everything that just don't there's power numbers but women when you break it down you break the numbers down to the bare bones they're leading the charge and everything in a negative light and that's I think it has a lot to do with there a much smaller population when it comes to the service community so there are more apt to be ice to do one self-medication isolation you know and then and they don't have nearly as big as a immediate tribe to depend on as we do because they're just way less of them and so that's that's our Brave Program and they can go do all the things that all the guys do and I called Flipper one in Flipper two and that's when I was kind of introduced to the nonprofit world and working with warriors and their families and first responders and law enforcement officers and their families you know it was like they clicked with me like I like I like this so you so you go through the two and a half months and you get clean what's the temptation like once you're clean are you are you feeling like I mean is it always there what is it for a while bro for a while it's all day every day every time I leave my room or I have to talk to someone rather I'm related to him or not or got for a bit I have to go to like the mall or some shit all I thought about for a while was man this would be so much easier if I was I right now all the time so I thought about for a while what about and I was like I don't want to experience what I'm about to have to experience I'd rather take the cowards way out so I was like I'm sure I could like I'm I'm passed out when he walks in I'm on a lot of drugs that'll work so I hear not call the door I'm like here the door open so they load their they're rolling me on the gurney and this young sailors pushing me and I remember every little like in the grout that separates tiles like every little bump it was like getting blown up again and it would just make it would take my pan from six to as much as you could think snap of a family and it was gnarly and so I remember he's going to push me on the elevator to take me down at ICU and you know the big gap the separates the floor and the elevator we goes across that He's like, you know, it's like he fell off a poster, and there he was, you know, like three red stripe, make Matt black belt, and just, I mean, drill master, all of you name it, and he did it. yeah man they sent me a stop thing today that's why i know this stuff get it for your business life and also you can right now order the follow on book two extreme ownership that are wrote with my brother life babbin it's called the dichotomy of leadership it is finding the balance as a leader and i talk about this all the time on the podcast i actually said i actually talked about this in the first public interview i ever did with Tim Ferriss he asked me about the qualities of leaders i said balance so well

and he said we're doing our hanging in there first son he said it could go could go hey you want to have him in with my brother my dad was like sure you know go ahead first order like he was gonna turn around come talk to me there by in the room he looks right at my father and says like okay these are some serious things where for six months to a year like I didn't know if I was gonna keep my left leg on my left arm because they they were I was going through all these operations to save these two appendages that were and for all its purposes I was a guinea pig for a lot of stuff which I'm okay with was better me than my brothers I'm alright with that small price to pay would be one of the world's finest right and they're like hey man we gotta do something this is you know this is this is our family no one even knows this is a thing with the hell are we doing and at the time I'm working at a place that focuses completely on the brain I'm surrounded by neuroscience this PhD's MD's and I'm learning a lot of things that just reiterated the fact that post-managed stress, rag, brain injury these are very, very real things and I worked there for three years while 22 kills started and it basically started as an awareness movement and that's where the push-up challenge was born the 22 push-up challenge I was started by 22 kills in 2012 this was this and that went viral in 2016 so you know overnight success is not a real thing and it's like, hey, I'm how pretty sure he's like, oh, well, I couldn't, I didn't do anything like, and I'm like, hey, first of all, there is no Richter skill on painted suffering. and I can't do that to the tribe on top of that there's I can't I need to get my shift together and it's gonna be ugly and it's gonna be sloppy and it's not gonna be it's gonna be the antithesis of what it should look like but I owe that to them I owe that to him that is when I decided that you know what I'm gonna I'm going to try really hard to do this life thing the way that I'm supposed to do it you know it was like if that's the way Murphy works dude not a fan not a fan of of that Murphy and so you know wake up and I'm like all right got a wake up team okay well when I walk off a stage the first time I walk off a stage and I feel like I didn't leave a piece of my soul there that's the last time I'll do it because again it's mutually beneficial and if it's not then in your presenter you're only gonna fake it for so long people don't really that's like I feel like I ran a marathon when I'm done presenting for an hour I'm mentally physically and emotionally exhausted and if you're not you're faking it it's getting out they know like one you know that happens to be number one number one kids podcast kids and family podcast so that's cool all right speaking of way the warrior kid there's the book way of the warrior kid and there's also the new book boom there it is hardcover way the warrior kid to marks mission uncle jake continues to help mark with some of his problems losing his temper how to handle being made fun of don't you wish somebody told you how to handle being made fun of yeah your kid and it just starts playing the video no advertisement here's the thing I don't mind the advertisements that's how I find out about like a bunch of the new music come out a lot of like um like you know intermittent and she's like you're gonna have to come back to BAM see we're gonna have to ween you off the drugs which is not what I wanted to hear because it was like when I left him so you're already saying he had to go on like no need to ever come back here done but just with us we so we have programs like Camp Baha'ala which is a program where we can we take up words first responders law force and officers the most in the early side of it is we're taking them up in the helicopter and taking them to kill hogs out of helicopter like as if you don't like that then you don't like freedom I'm dead say you're getting your first one hurry at first horse walks in so I'm like I gotta pass out as soon as you bust the hatch and walks in my freaking heart monitor dime is me out because it goes from like the slow steady beep to the the rapid beep and I'm like I'm up there obviously this isn't gonna work and there is no plan to be I'm awake and he looks at my family I'm in my dad's in there my mom my step mom my aunt my cousins my brother my sister and and it's it's a humbling experience to do it as well because being in the shadow of people like these guys people like yourself it's it's a humbling experience to be around warriors like that from all phases of history and we're gonna keep doing it and when you get that program rolling get your ass back on here we'll talk about it we'll talk about how it's going okay that's might not might not keep the left arm and I looked down at my left leg which was turned outward like if you're sitting down with both legs like you're gonna touch your toes my left leg was turned outward to the left and my foot was inverted like with my toes pointing at me and my boot was blown off but It was like a, I don't know if he's like a Lance Koolie and then there's like a staff sergeant and they had driver seat and I'm up on the turret, right? and I was like no this is like a three weeks supply and um man I started that's how I integrated I'm back into civilian society was high as a kite knowing that if I don't have to fill and I can do go through this thing numb nothing matters because if you can't fill it who cares you know I mean who cares and it was something that really was um it just got worse and worse I mean essentially what I did for a year and a half was chase my first high And he had like clocks, like multiple clocks from a from like a timers, like kitchen timers. it's you hear all the time like I want to help I don't know right me here a lot from reverts you know I want to I want to help save the puppies that don't have a home I tell people all the time if we were trying to raise money for dogs that died back so that we'd be sitting on a billion dollars it's true it's just is what it is why do you think we're still still spending billions and billions of dollars on all this research and all these studies and trying to figure it out because we just don't understand it that's why we you know we you talk about all timeers and CTE we don't even have the technology and the imaging to recognize these things in a living human we put a man on the moon in 1969 can't tell you if you have CTE wire life you know for me it's like hey let's step back and look at our priorities because one thing everyone's got is a brain everyone and the problem with the brain is there's no prosthetic for that you get the one you got and but I go see Ty mind you this time at this point I still haven't gotten like emotional one time like it's since I left do love like I haven't gotten emotional from my family or otherwise still pretty squared away with the emhole emotion thing I go see Ty but the the first guy the staffs are every day man every day and he started like he would walk in and like tickle where my right foot should be and it would tick it was crazy because it would tickle and it would not be like that come on bro
