00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jocco podcast number 230 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Good evening. Operation Rolling Thunder began in 1968. As we flew combat missions striking

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's hand-selected targets, we lost planes and men almost every day.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Fying from Yankee Station, the area of the Gulf of Tonkin where the aircraft carriers operated,

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we learned what it was like to sit in a wardrobe and a wardrobe table surrounded by empty chairs.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Half the time, we never knew what happened to them.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Maybe another pilot noticed an enemy surface to air missile launch or caught a fleeting glimpse of a burning American plane

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
heading toward the jungle below. Sometimes we'd hear the air crew requesting help on the ground,

9
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
dodging enemy patrols and calling for rescue. When the helicopters went in,

10
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the North Vietnamese were often waiting. They shot up the helicopters and their escorting planes.

11
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We sometimes got our man and lost three more in the process.

12
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We were flying not just for each other. We were flying for each other's families.

13
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The man on your wing usually had a wife, maybe some children.

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You took care of him to take care of them.

15
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We all faced moments where we risked our lives for each other to ensure the contact teams

16
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
did not knock on our brothers' door back in San Diego, Lamor, or would be island.

17
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
When the enemy scored, the families were devastated.

18
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You seldom see that written about, but we've all come home to tell widows and fatherless kids

19
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
how sorry we were. We gave them what peace we could.

20
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We've never seen that last night.

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It warps the rest of their lives as they wrestle with the pain.

22
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That old adage, time heals all wounds.

23
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
No.

24
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Fifty years on, I've seen those families still break down in tears as they talk of their fallen aviator.

25
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You don't get over that kind of pain.

26
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You just learn to live around it.

27
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It becomes part of who you are.

28
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And for us out on Yankee Station, that grief motivated us to sacrifice for each other.

29
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Not everyone could hack it.

30
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
There were days on Yankee Station where I watched air crews lose their nerve.

31
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The sudden some mechanical mysterious issue came up and a flight had to be scrubbed.

32
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Sometimes it happened when the same plane was on the catapult ready to launch.

33
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They just couldn't bring themselves to face it.

34
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Again, the most fearsome air defense network in the world,

35
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
erected by the North Vietnamese with Russian help around Hanoi.

36
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
On rare occasions, some men turned in their wings and went home rather than face that crucible again.

37
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It was easier to fly for an airline.

38
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In three years, the Navy lost 532 aircraft in combat,

39
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
including other operational losses associated with that war, the Navy had 644 aviators killed,

40
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
missing or taken prisoner of war.

41
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The total fixed wing aircraft losses of the Navy Marine Corps and Air Force together exceeded 2,400.

42
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Of course, it was intensely personal.

43
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Darryl Gary lived with nine guys in two houses on the beach in La Jolla when he went through training.

44
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
After the first trip to Yankee Station, six came home.

45
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Worse, we were losing the larger war.

46
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Destroying the targets given to us by the Pentagon seemed to make no difference in the war to the south.

47
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The losses mounted, and the migs started seeking us out.

48
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The North Vietnamese possessed a small but well-trained air force,

49
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
proxied by their Chinese and Soviet allies.

50
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
As good as it was, they were not in the same league as the Soviet Air Force,

51
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so in shanked shock waves through the Navy when North Vietnamese pilots started shooting us down.

52
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
During the Korean War, the North Korean Air Force was virtually wiped out in the opening months.

53
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
A decade later, the Vietnamese migs gave us a real fight.

54
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
They shot down one of ours for every two migs that we claimed.

55
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We considered that lost rate intolerable, given our long history of deeply one-sided kill ratios.

56
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
In World War II, US Naval Aviators crushed the Japanese in the central Pacific on the way to Tokyo with Hellcap pilots

57
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
who scored three-force of the Navy's air to air victories, posting a kill ratio on the order of 19-1.

58
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
In Vietnam, we were simply not allowed to win.

59
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So the Navy bureaucracy did what bureaucracies do best.

60
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It continued on course.

61
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Micro-managed from Washington, DC, we made the same mistakes month after month.

62
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000
In January 1969, a plane-scope-spoken carrier-skipper named Frank Alt wrote a report to the chief of naval operations,

63
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
detailing deadly flaws in our fighter tactics and weapon systems.

64
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
His list of complaints was a long one, and the Navy decided to act.

65
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Unfortunately, many in senior commands were more about their careers than about fixing the problem.

66
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
By approving the creation of an air combat post-graduate school, which we quickly named Top Gun,

67
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
they gave the appearance of doing something to change things.

68
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
President Johnson and Secretary McRenair's leadership, the Navy bureaucracy,

69
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
seemed more interested in appearing to solve problems than risking failure by actually trying to solve them.

70
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They gave the leadership of Top Gun to a relatively junior officer, me.

71
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And that right there is an excerpt from the opening of a book called Top Gun, an American story,

72
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000
by a man named Dan Peterson, a retired Navy captain, fighter pilot,

73
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Vietnam Air Combat Veteran, and the first officer in charge of the story,

74
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the story, the story, the Top Gun, the Navy fighter weapon school.

75
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And it is an honor to have Dan with us here tonight to talk about his experiences

76
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and share some of his lessons learned.

77
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Sir, thank you so much for coming on.

78
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And because it is Top Gun, I am woefully unqualified to speak with any experience on air combat,

79
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
also joining us is my friend from Ramadi and my colleague from National On Front Dave Burke,

80
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
who has been on this podcast more times than anyone.

81
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Who served as a fighter pilot in the United States Marine Corps Top Gun instructor,

82
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Top Gun Senior instructor, Ford Air Controller with us in Ramadi on the ground.

83
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And pilot of the F-18, the F-16, the F-22, and the F-35.

84
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So I figured I'd bring someone you could actually talk to, sir.

85
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
That's great.

86
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So you know, you go through some of this stuff in the book,

87
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but I want to just kind of lay the groundwork of where you grew up.

88
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I know you were born in Illinois.

89
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
What was your childhood like?

90
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And I want to take us through childhood up through where you were in the Navy

91
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and then we'll get back into the book.

92
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
This is, uh, earliest, met real memories.

93
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The end of the Second World War.

94
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
My dad had been in Europe, sliding for four years,

95
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and came home and his job was already filled.

96
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Move down to California.

97
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Came to Riverside, California.

98
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And he worked as a puttin' pipeline in Palm Springs during that period of time.

99
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I was going to school and working a couple of jobs and making,

100
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
making ends meet, guys.

101
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And that's where I grew up.

102
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Then I went to Wittier.

103
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And the draft came breathing on everybody,

104
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the follow on draft for Korea.

105
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And I joined the Navy Reserve and listed guy.

106
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
How old were you when you joined the Navy Reserve?

107
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I don't know, probably 17.

108
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Just right there.

109
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And did you associate the Navy with aviation?

110
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah.

111
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So you kind of knew, you know,

112
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Juckoh, how I got started really.

113
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I was in a little sit guy and I messed up.

114
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
There are NES lots of automatos.

115
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It was pretty busy basing those days.

116
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
A lot of World War II props, corsairs.

117
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And I was a Mac.

118
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
That's when I trained to be.

119
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It was a Mac.

120
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And I was mentored by a chief named Brown.

121
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
During that time, I learned to mess up.

122
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It saved my life for all of me out of the Galle.

123
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And I got out on the flight line,

124
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
started carrying the man's toolbox and getting his coffee

125
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
when he wanted.

126
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And he taught me a great deal about it.

127
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And what really turned me on got me going.

128
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
This is too thin.

129
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It's quickly.

130
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
There was the lieutenant doing a test flying in that squatter.

131
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And we were the first quarter and get jets.

132
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And we had some two seaters.

133
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
TV, two's.

134
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
M.T. backseat.

135
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Every time I'd work on an engineer playing go through flight test.

136
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And a person at Lutin says, you know, empty back seat is a waste.

137
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Come on, go with me.

138
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And I flew with him in the backseat.

139
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Maybe five, six, seven, eight times.

140
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And I was hooked.

141
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
You know that feeling.

142
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
David.

143
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yes.

144
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
You know. And so I started flying with him.

145
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And he quickly said, you're natural.

146
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You know, you're pretty good at what he said.

147
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I'll arrange for the exams.

148
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And we'll do a physical on it.

149
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
We'll go to Pensacola.

150
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I said, right on.

151
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And I was working two jobs and sleeping in my car.

152
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Going to college at time.

153
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So it was a perfect time for it.

154
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And coming to one of the last weekends I spent with those guys.

155
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
In comes Z. Cormere and the blue angels.

156
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And he had a small smile on me.

157
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So I watched the blue angels fly.

158
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And there was a cutless David.

159
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Put on a, I can't read Billy Phillips.

160
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Whoops have me? obscene what Stanley Phillips is doing?

161
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.74
�� What's this and Matthew Phillips set me up to make you

162
00:12:35.74 --> 00:12:40.24
going to adjective for something good tonight?

163
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:41.74
That'sfor me, keep you up.

164
00:12:41.74 --> 00:12:43.46
Yes, we haveledge of truth.

165
00:12:43.46 --> 00:12:45.62
We haveledge of truth.

166
00:12:45.62 --> 00:12:47.34
His story that Beth choke said about Charlie and I

167
00:12:47.34 --> 00:12:51.08
did not obviously listen to him so that they're killer,

168
00:12:51.08 --> 00:12:52.40
remember so that he wouldn't take me Rat Moyni,

169
00:12:51.90 --> 00:12:54.000
knows to know who Grabbed the Rice?

170
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.88
Cadet program, you know, and I got to tell you more about when we talk about the squadron.

171
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:02.60
It was the first fighter squadron.

172
00:13:02.60 --> 00:13:03.60
Got it.

173
00:13:03.60 --> 00:13:06.24
With the five aces.

174
00:13:06.24 --> 00:13:09.40
The old guys from the second world war are getting out.

175
00:13:09.40 --> 00:13:12.92
Young guys like me were the future ones.

176
00:13:12.92 --> 00:13:18.76
Yeah, the other thing I always like to think about when we talk about, you know, the past

177
00:13:18.76 --> 00:13:20.24
wars.

178
00:13:20.24 --> 00:13:23.12
You getting into a jet.

179
00:13:23.12 --> 00:13:26.04
What kind of jet was it that the with young was going to be to.

180
00:13:26.04 --> 00:13:28.60
So you get into a TV too.

181
00:13:28.60 --> 00:13:30.60
This is like science fiction.

182
00:13:30.60 --> 00:13:36.80
I mean, the state of technology and you're whatever, 18 or 19 years old and you're going

183
00:13:36.80 --> 00:13:41.44
into the most modern high speed aircraft ever created.

184
00:13:41.44 --> 00:13:42.44
That's right.

185
00:13:42.44 --> 00:13:43.44
That's right.

186
00:13:43.44 --> 00:13:47.32
And there was a there weren't any passenger jets in those days.

187
00:13:47.32 --> 00:13:53.24
Probably a DCA tour being invented here in San Diego.

188
00:13:53.24 --> 00:13:56.56
And it was the first Jedi had ever been in.

189
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.36
That was an e-ticket ride.

190
00:13:58.36 --> 00:13:59.64
First time.

191
00:13:59.64 --> 00:14:02.64
So I'm going to go back to the book here.

192
00:14:02.64 --> 00:14:04.72
You get down to Pensacola.

193
00:14:04.72 --> 00:14:05.72
And you say this.

194
00:14:05.72 --> 00:14:10.64
I Pensacola, we flew the S N J. Texan and the T 28.

195
00:14:10.64 --> 00:14:14.04
On my first morning there, our drill sergeant woke us up in the barracks with the

196
00:14:14.04 --> 00:14:18.24
rattle of his nightstick along the seal frames of our bonks, then double time to sound

197
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:21.36
to an aging hanger beside the sea plane ramp.

198
00:14:21.36 --> 00:14:25.72
In the very same building where some of Naval aviation pioneers established our tradition

199
00:14:25.72 --> 00:14:29.16
to drill sergeant smoked us with 40 minutes of PT.

200
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:31.08
Each morning started with the same ritual.

201
00:14:31.08 --> 00:14:36.12
We worked out in the hanger amongst the ghosts of those who had paved the way for us.

202
00:14:36.12 --> 00:14:40.48
Thanks to them, Naval aviation became the rebel branch of the service.

203
00:14:40.48 --> 00:14:45.24
We were always striving to develop new ideas, new technology, and new ways of fighting that

204
00:14:45.24 --> 00:14:48.88
would send the age of the battleship into history.

205
00:14:48.88 --> 00:14:53.32
From the battles of the coral sea and midway to the great Marianne's Turkey shoot, they

206
00:14:53.32 --> 00:14:58.88
transformed the US Navy into the most effective Naval fighting force on the planet.

207
00:14:58.88 --> 00:15:02.08
Everywhere we went in Pensacola, we felt that tradition and it was an honor to be

208
00:15:02.08 --> 00:15:04.20
invited to be a part of it.

209
00:15:04.20 --> 00:15:08.12
Would my generation contribute to perpetuate in the years ahead?

210
00:15:08.12 --> 00:15:12.96
One thing for sure, I was not going to be the one who washed out and went home to be just

211
00:15:12.96 --> 00:15:18.20
another college kid with ductal hair, working odd jobs to cover tuition.

212
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:22.40
Where other cadets bought cars and spent time in town drinking a trader John's another

213
00:15:22.40 --> 00:15:26.92
local aviator watering holes I made a point of staying on base.

214
00:15:26.92 --> 00:15:31.56
My dad's ethic became mine and you talked a lot about your dad's work ethic in here.

215
00:15:31.56 --> 00:15:33.20
I studied in work hard.

216
00:15:33.20 --> 00:15:37.76
I was determined to be among the top cadets upon graduation who would be handed the

217
00:15:37.76 --> 00:15:42.32
keys to the latest and greatest fighter jets are country produced.

218
00:15:42.32 --> 00:15:46.24
After basic school of Pensacola, we required to take a cross country instrument flight

219
00:15:46.24 --> 00:15:51.92
to California, the final stage before we advanced to school in Beville, Texas.

220
00:15:51.92 --> 00:15:55.64
The fringe benefit of this last evolution was a chance to visit home.

221
00:15:55.64 --> 00:15:58.72
Now here's the caveat that I always need to make when I read these things.

222
00:15:58.72 --> 00:16:01.76
I'm just skipping giant parts of this book.

223
00:16:01.76 --> 00:16:05.32
The amount of detail, the stories that you're telling the characters that you're bringing

224
00:16:05.32 --> 00:16:10.08
out in this book throughout the book are just awesome.

225
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:15.76
It's a historical gem just to be able to read it.

226
00:16:15.76 --> 00:16:20.28
But I'm not going to read the whole thing on the podcast and people need to buy the book

227
00:16:20.28 --> 00:16:23.000
if they want to get all that out of it.

228
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.36
There's an audio book as well.

229
00:16:25.36 --> 00:16:30.08
Either way, you need to read the whole book in order to get this.

230
00:16:30.08 --> 00:16:35.28
But this, you felt that and I went to our officer candidate school down in Pensacola

231
00:16:35.28 --> 00:16:43.24
and they have the amazing naval aviation museum there, which is one of the best, I think

232
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:45.68
it may be the best museum I've ever been to.

233
00:16:45.68 --> 00:16:49.88
I've heard the World War II museum in New Orleans is equally awesome, but I haven't been

234
00:16:49.88 --> 00:16:51.20
there yet.

235
00:16:51.20 --> 00:16:57.44
But you just felt that heritage as a guy going through OCS.

236
00:16:57.44 --> 00:17:06.44
You know, just to be selected for something like that, I've been done reasonably well

237
00:17:06.44 --> 00:17:14.20
in school academically and to be allowed to go down there.

238
00:17:14.20 --> 00:17:20.000
And you know, you guys are all pros at working out every day.

239
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.40
They marine die, tallest and new discipline, every day in their whole hangar.

240
00:17:27.40 --> 00:17:30.68
He worked us and then we'd run.

241
00:17:30.68 --> 00:17:38.56
And then we'd go to the, what you call it, the course, you know, the obstacle course.

242
00:17:38.56 --> 00:17:45.60
obstacle course and all the things I've seen it in the SEAL video as a movies and it was

243
00:17:45.60 --> 00:17:48.16
a ton of life.

244
00:17:48.16 --> 00:17:54.36
But when you make a commitment to go and it didn't take long and Pensacola to find out

245
00:17:54.36 --> 00:18:00.28
how you got to go to the first team in the first team be a great fleet squad and a

246
00:18:00.28 --> 00:18:01.60
care.

247
00:18:01.60 --> 00:18:04.52
You got to have the great.

248
00:18:04.52 --> 00:18:09.88
So the motivation was there and it was fun.

249
00:18:09.88 --> 00:18:14.32
Now did everybody in your flight school want to be, want to get jets?

250
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:16.12
Was it just 100% competition?

251
00:18:16.12 --> 00:18:17.12
Yeah.

252
00:18:17.12 --> 00:18:22.44
I had a roommate named Malklaid's, Marine, Marine pilot.

253
00:18:22.44 --> 00:18:29.16
I pinned his wings on, he pinned my wings on the daily finish and he was a great football player

254
00:18:29.16 --> 00:18:32.36
Orange County high school.

255
00:18:32.36 --> 00:18:33.80
And we went in together.

256
00:18:33.80 --> 00:18:40.16
We were roommates all the way through and he decides to go Marine Corps for the last

257
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:41.16
minute.

258
00:18:41.16 --> 00:18:53.08
But we both found we're going to go and score well and we knew we'd get fleet squad.

259
00:18:53.08 --> 00:18:58.12
You know, a real piece of the history out of that into my logbooks.

260
00:18:58.12 --> 00:19:04.76
They hadn't seen anybody to a fleet squad or not of Beville in about a year.

261
00:19:04.76 --> 00:19:07.72
I got the first set of orders.

262
00:19:07.72 --> 00:19:13.60
It was worth it.

263
00:19:13.60 --> 00:19:18.68
I was just talking about from the book when you had to do a cross country instrument

264
00:19:18.68 --> 00:19:19.68
flight to California.

265
00:19:19.68 --> 00:19:25.28
This gave you a chance to go home and you mentioned this in the book.

266
00:19:25.28 --> 00:19:31.72
Mary Beth stood on the tarmac looking up at me with my parents at her side.

267
00:19:31.72 --> 00:19:37.32
She was a vision in an Angora sweater and below the knee skirt.

268
00:19:37.32 --> 00:19:41.68
And flat healed shoes and with her hair down she had a smile on her face.

269
00:19:41.68 --> 00:19:44.80
Maybe just a hint of awe as well.

270
00:19:44.80 --> 00:19:47.56
I could hope.

271
00:19:47.56 --> 00:19:51.76
I unstrapped and climbed out dressed in a khaki flight suit, a matching jacket and navy

272
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:53.72
issued chuck of boots.

273
00:19:53.72 --> 00:19:57.20
I barely made it down the ladder when she wrapped her arms around me.

274
00:19:57.20 --> 00:20:01.12
In an instant, the year of separation seemed like an eye blink.

275
00:20:01.12 --> 00:20:07.20
I knew beyond a doubt this was the woman I wanted to marry.

276
00:20:07.20 --> 00:20:09.16
But you fast forward a little bit all too soon.

277
00:20:09.16 --> 00:20:10.48
The beautiful interlude ended.

278
00:20:10.48 --> 00:20:13.20
My instructor met me at Al Toro a few days after Christmas.

279
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:17.96
I wore the ring on my right hand as I kissed Mary Beth goodbye on the ramp she had given

280
00:20:17.96 --> 00:20:19.60
you a ring.

281
00:20:19.60 --> 00:20:22.04
Soon I would be an officer in a gentleman.

282
00:20:22.04 --> 00:20:25.32
I'd ask her father for permission to propose.

283
00:20:25.32 --> 00:20:27.88
We'd start a life together in the navy.

284
00:20:27.88 --> 00:20:33.88
A final hug, no tears and I scrambled up the ladder and into the con cockpit.

285
00:20:33.88 --> 00:20:39.52
As Bill Pearson and I taxid out to run away, I saw her waving goodbye to her naval aviation

286
00:20:39.52 --> 00:20:40.68
cadet.

287
00:20:40.68 --> 00:20:44.56
When I landed at Beville, my first jet fighter waited me on the flight line.

288
00:20:44.56 --> 00:20:50.96
She was a grummin, pff, f-9 f- Panther, a well-traveled aircraft whose dark blue aluminum

289
00:20:50.96 --> 00:20:55.16
skin was dotted with patched over bullet holes.

290
00:20:55.16 --> 00:21:00.20
Like my instructor, she was a veteran of Korea, her paint dulled by years of service,

291
00:21:00.20 --> 00:21:06.000
either straight wing and sub-mock-one top speed the Panther had been relegated to state-side

292
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.16
pastures where she helped train the next generation of naval aviation.

293
00:21:13.16 --> 00:21:16.96
Was Korea over at this point or was there a chance that you were still?

294
00:21:16.96 --> 00:21:17.96
No.

295
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:18.96
So what year was this?

296
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:23.36
Um, 1955 and 50, uh, 56.

297
00:21:23.36 --> 00:21:24.36
Okay.

298
00:21:24.36 --> 00:21:26.88
56 so it would have been a B-ville.

299
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:27.88
Fine.

300
00:21:27.88 --> 00:21:29.88
So Korea's well over at this point.

301
00:21:29.88 --> 00:21:34.36
But you still got these pilots, your instructors are straight up combat vets.

302
00:21:34.36 --> 00:21:36.20
Well, from Korea.

303
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:38.20
And they were good.

304
00:21:38.20 --> 00:21:40.000
Very, very good.

305
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.12
They were the best.

306
00:21:43.12 --> 00:21:48.52
This section that you talk about flight school and again, there's so much in this book

307
00:21:48.52 --> 00:21:54.52
to cover, you know, it was a challenge for me to figure out where I wanted to spend

308
00:21:54.52 --> 00:21:55.52
time.

309
00:21:55.52 --> 00:21:57.40
You talk about flight school.

310
00:21:57.40 --> 00:22:02.88
You have a great section in there about when you make mistakes and you have failures

311
00:22:02.88 --> 00:22:08.20
and what your attitude was and your attitude was, okay, I messed this up.

312
00:22:08.20 --> 00:22:10.16
What do I need to do to fix it?

313
00:22:10.16 --> 00:22:15.52
And you know, you had that attitude of taking ownership of things and then doing the

314
00:22:15.52 --> 00:22:17.32
hard work to get it done.

315
00:22:17.32 --> 00:22:26.76
I've heard your books and looked at some of your programs and when you play in the league

316
00:22:26.76 --> 00:22:34.88
as a possible naval avid or and you make a commitment to finish as a same as a program

317
00:22:34.88 --> 00:22:37.48
you guys went through.

318
00:22:37.48 --> 00:22:41.64
And I'm talking about the training, okay.

319
00:22:41.64 --> 00:22:47.28
And you're dealing human life each other's everyday fine.

320
00:22:47.28 --> 00:22:48.76
Failures unacceptable.

321
00:22:48.76 --> 00:22:49.76
You do.

322
00:22:49.76 --> 00:22:51.32
You make a mistake.

323
00:22:51.32 --> 00:22:56.36
And this mistake that's in the book, it may have to do with a very old,

324
00:22:56.36 --> 00:23:02.48
navigation system but we were required to be proficient at it.

325
00:23:02.48 --> 00:23:10.88
And I got confused in the weather one day and made a mistake went back and flew that

326
00:23:10.88 --> 00:23:15.72
check right again and out of 18 months of training.

327
00:23:15.72 --> 00:23:18.12
That's the only time that happened to me.

328
00:23:18.12 --> 00:23:22.12
But it was unacceptable to fail.

329
00:23:22.12 --> 00:23:32.20
Guys, that's what I'm telling you and I wanted, I wanted to be a naval avid so bad.

330
00:23:32.20 --> 00:23:42.24
So well, on March 1st, 1957, I got my wings.

331
00:23:42.24 --> 00:23:47.60
When my orders arrived, I tore open the envelope running through my worst case scenarios.

332
00:23:47.60 --> 00:23:55.000
The first of which was blimp's, yes, the 1950s Navy still flew airships.

333
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.36
We called them poopy bags.

334
00:23:57.36 --> 00:24:02.96
Nobody wanted to go from flying panthers and t-birds to puttering around at 70 knots with a

335
00:24:02.96 --> 00:24:05.52
gigantic bag of gas over your head.

336
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:06.80
No thank you.

337
00:24:06.80 --> 00:24:09.40
Then there was an ASW anti submarine warfare.

338
00:24:09.40 --> 00:24:15.56
This meant multi-engine flying and and in terminally long patrols over open ocean where

339
00:24:15.56 --> 00:24:18.84
everybody aboard tried not to fall asleep.

340
00:24:18.84 --> 00:24:23.80
I took a breath, looked down on my orders and read the official Verbiage Directing Me

341
00:24:23.80 --> 00:24:27.96
to report in 30 days to San Diego.

342
00:24:27.96 --> 00:24:29.12
I read it twice.

343
00:24:29.12 --> 00:24:31.56
Then a third time just to be sure I wasn't dreaming.

344
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:37.28
I was going to a squadron known as VFAW III.

345
00:24:37.28 --> 00:24:40.000
V stood for heavier than air.

346
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.80
No blimps for me.

347
00:24:41.80 --> 00:24:44.60
F stood for fighters.

348
00:24:44.60 --> 00:24:47.80
AW stood for all weather.

349
00:24:47.80 --> 00:24:49.16
I done it.

350
00:24:49.16 --> 00:24:52.36
I was going to be a jet fighter pilot.

351
00:24:52.36 --> 00:24:56.84
I was on the road to top gun.

352
00:24:56.84 --> 00:25:02.000
How many guys from your group ended up making it to jets to fighter jets?

353
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Two.

354
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.84
I'll close when I.

355
00:25:04.84 --> 00:25:05.84
My rooming.

356
00:25:05.84 --> 00:25:06.84
Wow.

357
00:25:06.84 --> 00:25:10.32
He went to Makah.

358
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:16.80
Oh, down in a flu FJ Fiery's at down on Miami Beach.

359
00:25:16.80 --> 00:25:20.72
Opa Laka was the name of that base, down in the Marine Bay.

360
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:25.12
I went home to Merrimar in San Diego.

361
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:31.48
The same state as my Murray-Beth, which was when I got to be honest among them was

362
00:25:31.48 --> 00:25:32.88
with part of my motivation.

363
00:25:32.88 --> 00:25:34.32
I wanted to be back.

364
00:25:34.32 --> 00:25:36.52
I miss her a lot.

365
00:25:36.52 --> 00:25:40.68
And suddenly in the middle of the book, there's 16 photos.

366
00:25:40.68 --> 00:25:46.24
Some of the airplanes that you described, Joko, and a couple great pictures of Beth and

367
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:47.24
I.

368
00:25:47.24 --> 00:25:48.68
Yeah, particularly her.

369
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:53.40
And what's nice is they put together the use-collar, full-collar photographs.

370
00:25:53.40 --> 00:25:54.40
Yeah.

371
00:25:54.40 --> 00:25:57.000
I can tell you, you had a lot more cloud rolling into your book publishing.

372
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.88
You can look at the first edition of my first book has a bunch of crappy black and white

373
00:26:02.88 --> 00:26:04.52
photos on bad paper.

374
00:26:04.52 --> 00:26:07.28
Look at the full glossy scenario going on.

375
00:26:07.28 --> 00:26:12.68
Thanks to the first top-good movie.

376
00:26:12.68 --> 00:26:14.44
So we're going back to the book here.

377
00:26:14.44 --> 00:26:18.60
My first act as an ins and the US Navy was to buy a car.

378
00:26:18.60 --> 00:26:22.12
My gang of new officers at lunch for the first time at the officers club in Corpus Christi

379
00:26:22.12 --> 00:26:25.36
Texas decided, at least one of us needed to have a set of wheels.

380
00:26:25.36 --> 00:26:28.44
We rolled the dice to see you would go down to the dealership and I lost.

381
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:35.36
I picked out a brand new 1957 Ford Fairlane, Raven Black with black and colonial white

382
00:26:35.36 --> 00:26:39.88
matching interior, sidewall straight out of American graffiti.

383
00:26:39.88 --> 00:26:45.08
I drove home from Texas to in my new ride, eager to see Mary Beth, make a men's and

384
00:26:45.08 --> 00:26:46.44
take her for a spin.

385
00:26:46.44 --> 00:26:50.60
I had 30 days of leave before I needed to report and I intended to use every minute

386
00:26:50.60 --> 00:26:53.28
of it counting my girl.

387
00:26:53.28 --> 00:26:57.40
But morning after I got home, I went to meet with Mary Beth.

388
00:26:57.40 --> 00:26:59.36
You didn't write, she said.

389
00:26:59.36 --> 00:27:02.12
I didn't get any letters for a while.

390
00:27:02.12 --> 00:27:05.40
I was about to explain when she said, Dan, I'm seeing someone.

391
00:27:05.40 --> 00:27:10.16
When you didn't write, well, he was persistent and I gave in.

392
00:27:10.16 --> 00:27:11.28
I didn't know what to say.

393
00:27:11.28 --> 00:27:13.36
He was a football player at college.

394
00:27:13.36 --> 00:27:16.72
They've been seeing each other for a few weeks.

395
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:21.80
And you know, I talked about, well, you talk about it in the book when the training was

396
00:27:21.80 --> 00:27:22.80
really hard.

397
00:27:22.80 --> 00:27:26.72
Obviously, you had to prioritize what you were going to focus on.

398
00:27:26.72 --> 00:27:30.44
Even though you wrote Mary Beth every night, when the training got to a point where you

399
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:34.12
had to focus more on the training, you didn't write for some time or sometimes you didn't

400
00:27:34.12 --> 00:27:35.12
write.

401
00:27:35.12 --> 00:27:39.44
And that was the little break in the opportunity for this football player.

402
00:27:39.44 --> 00:27:52.24
It was when I had the one navigation flight failure and it rocked my foundation.

403
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:57.96
And I missed a couple weeks of writing to her otherwise for 18 months when written back

404
00:27:57.96 --> 00:28:02.76
and forth every day, except for that period of time.

405
00:28:02.76 --> 00:28:08.44
And a beautiful young girl going to college and she was pretty popular girl.

406
00:28:08.44 --> 00:28:09.44
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:28:09.44 --> 00:28:13.96
Damn football player.

408
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:17.68
You're up against some tough competition.

409
00:28:17.68 --> 00:28:19.000
But you have to drive on.

410
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.80
You go to North Island at North Island, the guard at the front gate gave me directions

411
00:28:22.80 --> 00:28:25.60
to VFAW III.

412
00:28:25.60 --> 00:28:32.36
The squadron's executive commander was a guy named Commander Eugene Valencia.

413
00:28:32.36 --> 00:28:37.88
Round face and solidly built with thinning hair, my new exo happened to be the third highest

414
00:28:37.88 --> 00:28:43.72
US Navy Ace of World War II, one of the great legends of our community.

415
00:28:43.72 --> 00:28:52.52
In one engagement over the Japanese home islands in 1945, he shot down six enemy planes.

416
00:28:52.52 --> 00:29:00.20
He finished the war with 23 flags on the side of his F6F Hellcat.

417
00:29:00.20 --> 00:29:06.28
The man introducing himself to me held the Navy Cross and six distinguished flying crosses.

418
00:29:06.28 --> 00:29:08.64
I was in awe.

419
00:29:08.64 --> 00:29:12.08
Yet Commander Valencia was anything but arrogant.

420
00:29:12.08 --> 00:29:16.20
He greeted me and set me at ease with his relaxed, honest, zooming nature.

421
00:29:16.20 --> 00:29:20.56
It was hard to believe that a man with so many accomplishments could be so grounded and

422
00:29:20.56 --> 00:29:22.56
approachable.

423
00:29:22.56 --> 00:29:27.20
It was exactly that.

424
00:29:27.20 --> 00:29:29.80
And did you know this going into the room?

425
00:29:29.80 --> 00:29:30.80
Oh no.

426
00:29:30.80 --> 00:29:31.80
I had.

427
00:29:31.80 --> 00:29:34.88
I had no background on the fighter squadron.

428
00:29:34.88 --> 00:29:44.72
He was one, the skipper, the squadron was Howard A. D. who flew and found the Japanese fleet

429
00:29:44.72 --> 00:29:46.60
to battle the midway.

430
00:29:46.60 --> 00:29:48.76
He was a commanding officer.

431
00:29:48.76 --> 00:29:50.56
And there were four other racers.

432
00:29:50.56 --> 00:29:54.72
The famous Texo Niel was in that fighter squadron.

433
00:29:54.72 --> 00:30:00.24
He talked about walking in the ready room and you knew you're pecking order.

434
00:30:00.24 --> 00:30:03.32
And these guys were bigger in life.

435
00:30:03.32 --> 00:30:05.76
What does it take to become an ace?

436
00:30:05.76 --> 00:30:06.76
You got to get five.

437
00:30:06.76 --> 00:30:07.76
You got to get five.

438
00:30:07.76 --> 00:30:09.76
I've made the number.

439
00:30:09.76 --> 00:30:12.56
And he became an ace and he shot down six planes.

440
00:30:12.56 --> 00:30:16.16
And one day.

441
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:18.52
How long did it take you to start putting this together?

442
00:30:18.52 --> 00:30:20.16
I mean, these guys were in their dress uniforms.

443
00:30:20.16 --> 00:30:22.12
Are you looking at this guy's rack of ribbons?

444
00:30:22.12 --> 00:30:24.96
Seeing that he's a Navy Cross or something?

445
00:30:24.96 --> 00:30:26.60
You know, most of it.

446
00:30:26.60 --> 00:30:29.68
Most of it's done at the bar.

447
00:30:29.68 --> 00:30:39.52
And there's a bar in North Island called the Ibar, which the Saces, they control the place.

448
00:30:39.52 --> 00:30:42.08
And they had their own bartender.

449
00:30:42.08 --> 00:30:46.08
And once and a while you get invited to go with them.

450
00:30:46.08 --> 00:30:49.12
And a good, good, volentious story.

451
00:30:49.12 --> 00:30:51.48
I hit it off with the old man.

452
00:30:51.48 --> 00:30:55.12
I flew with him as I said, wasn't the best.

453
00:30:55.12 --> 00:30:56.76
But I got enough.

454
00:30:56.76 --> 00:31:02.28
I got enough for a really to pick up on his ammo.

455
00:31:02.28 --> 00:31:05.40
How he operated during combat.

456
00:31:05.40 --> 00:31:07.64
A lot of about tactics.

457
00:31:07.64 --> 00:31:11.16
He and Texan, the only guys.

458
00:31:11.16 --> 00:31:14.40
They were mentoring us.

459
00:31:14.40 --> 00:31:20.12
There were five incidents eventually in that year in that squatter.

460
00:31:20.12 --> 00:31:25.20
And we had all the 50, 60 airplanes I think.

461
00:31:25.20 --> 00:31:26.88
Four different kinds.

462
00:31:26.88 --> 00:31:28.52
All the flight time.

463
00:31:28.52 --> 00:31:30.76
David, do you ever, ever find yourself?

464
00:31:30.76 --> 00:31:32.32
We had all the flight time.

465
00:31:32.32 --> 00:31:35.88
He could physically and.

466
00:31:35.88 --> 00:31:38.60
I don't ever remember flying too much.

467
00:31:38.60 --> 00:31:39.60
Yeah.

468
00:31:39.60 --> 00:31:41.60
Well, just.

469
00:31:41.60 --> 00:31:45.60
And we, they all mentored us.

470
00:31:45.60 --> 00:31:46.44
I started.

471
00:31:46.44 --> 00:31:48.64
I went to first day of hook.

472
00:31:48.64 --> 00:31:50.76
First day of hook.

473
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:52.12
Convention.

474
00:31:52.12 --> 00:31:57.08
And what I did with I carried this brief case full of scotch.

475
00:31:57.08 --> 00:31:59.28
And that's the instance mission.

476
00:31:59.28 --> 00:32:00.28
Yeah.

477
00:32:00.28 --> 00:32:01.28
The instance.

478
00:32:01.28 --> 00:32:05.64
And since all went down there with the lynch, Alex, for I shoot another living

479
00:32:05.64 --> 00:32:08.08
ace 25 victories.

480
00:32:08.08 --> 00:32:10.76
These guys are bigger in life, you know.

481
00:32:10.76 --> 00:32:16.28
And your teams have the same reputations.

482
00:32:16.28 --> 00:32:20.60
Yeah, when I checked into seal team one, the executive officer was a prime listed guy

483
00:32:20.60 --> 00:32:24.04
that was a Vietnam legend.

484
00:32:24.04 --> 00:32:27.72
There's a famous picture of the seals and Vietnam of this.

485
00:32:27.72 --> 00:32:30.72
The picture always says that dirty doesn't on it, even though there's more than 12 of them.

486
00:32:30.72 --> 00:32:37.12
But it says that dirty does and they're holding up a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

487
00:32:37.12 --> 00:32:38.36
he's one of the guys in that picture.

488
00:32:38.36 --> 00:32:43.40
You know, he's the guy that he's one of the guys that the seal teams reputation is built

489
00:32:43.40 --> 00:32:44.40
upon.

490
00:32:44.40 --> 00:32:49.52
And I, I remember looking, you know, look, I, at that time, I didn't know the difference

491
00:32:49.52 --> 00:32:55.52
between a marksmanship ribbon and a metal of honor when you're looking at the uniform.

492
00:32:55.52 --> 00:32:57.52
And I'm, I just looked in, said that's a lot.

493
00:32:57.52 --> 00:33:00.44
These guys got a lot of decorations on his uniform.

494
00:33:00.44 --> 00:33:04.04
And we, you know, the ones that I did know the purple heart, this overstar, I'm looking

495
00:33:04.04 --> 00:33:10.88
at it going, okay, this, this, this is, this is a, this is everything you dream of, right?

496
00:33:10.88 --> 00:33:12.52
It's to be sitting across my table.

497
00:33:12.52 --> 00:33:14.16
I'm 19 years old.

498
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:16.88
And this guy's telling me, welcome aboard seal team one.

499
00:33:16.88 --> 00:33:19.48
Oh, that's right.

500
00:33:19.48 --> 00:33:20.68
It doesn't get me better than that.

501
00:33:20.68 --> 00:33:26.32
And the little thing example of where they've been and what they've done.

502
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:32.32
And they're willingness, like, philenchin at holes, five or six of the guys who had really

503
00:33:32.32 --> 00:33:34.32
done it all.

504
00:33:34.32 --> 00:33:36.68
They, they made no bones upon it.

505
00:33:36.68 --> 00:33:38.84
They were there to mentor us.

506
00:33:38.84 --> 00:33:44.52
They went home and night with their families and their grown kids and their glasses

507
00:33:44.52 --> 00:33:48.56
got and they let the fund us.

508
00:33:48.56 --> 00:33:54.24
I flew two to three times a day, just as much as I could stand.

509
00:33:54.24 --> 00:33:59.76
And that's what, when I showed you a log book today, yeah, that's pretty good for

510
00:33:59.76 --> 00:34:03.16
the final pilot at my age.

511
00:34:03.16 --> 00:34:10.32
And I ended up at first quarter, fifteen hundred hours a head of my contemporaries.

512
00:34:10.32 --> 00:34:13.56
Dave, how many hours did you fly at your first quadrant?

513
00:34:13.56 --> 00:34:18.20
I left my first quadrant after four years with twelve hundred hours.

514
00:34:18.20 --> 00:34:21.36
So the numbers you're talking about when I said I don't ever remember flying too much

515
00:34:21.36 --> 00:34:23.60
is because I didn't get to fly like that.

516
00:34:23.60 --> 00:34:24.60
That's impressive.

517
00:34:24.60 --> 00:34:27.84
So you did fourteen hundred hours after four years.

518
00:34:27.84 --> 00:34:33.20
Dan, you're saying you had fifteen hundred hours more than your contemporaries.

519
00:34:33.20 --> 00:34:34.20
Yeah.

520
00:34:34.20 --> 00:34:35.20
Yeah.

521
00:34:35.20 --> 00:34:38.84
Well, you know, I thoroughly liked it.

522
00:34:38.84 --> 00:34:43.08
Well, I was there. I got to fly the F6FL cat.

523
00:34:43.08 --> 00:34:48.68
Gino, they had a bunch of my repair facility in North Island.

524
00:34:48.68 --> 00:34:55.64
And Gino kept talking about the guns and how he worked everything in that airplane.

525
00:34:55.64 --> 00:34:57.96
That's where he got his victories.

526
00:34:57.96 --> 00:35:00.32
So he says, you want to fly it?

527
00:35:00.32 --> 00:35:05.84
So I picked a phone up and he called the chief over the Naval repair facility.

528
00:35:05.84 --> 00:35:09.40
And he says, I got six of my, I can't get anybody to fly him.

529
00:35:09.40 --> 00:35:12.64
So I'm going to over and I flew the F6FL cat.

530
00:35:12.64 --> 00:35:19.36
When you're transferring from one helicopter up from one aircraft to another aircraft,

531
00:35:19.36 --> 00:35:23.12
how hard is it to make those adaptations?

532
00:35:23.12 --> 00:35:25.48
It's easy.

533
00:35:25.48 --> 00:35:29.84
If you love it, Jacoits, easy.

534
00:35:29.84 --> 00:35:31.96
Later on, the book, I'm sure.

535
00:35:31.96 --> 00:35:32.96
We were up at Dreamland.

536
00:35:32.96 --> 00:35:33.96
Yeah.

537
00:35:33.96 --> 00:35:34.96
Area 51.

538
00:35:34.96 --> 00:35:44.08
And in 30 minutes, I came in and a transport didn't even know where I was.

539
00:35:44.08 --> 00:35:49.68
They took us in a hanger, an open hanger doors, because they didn't want the satellites

540
00:35:49.68 --> 00:35:51.72
to see what they had.

541
00:35:51.72 --> 00:35:56.24
And Guy walks in with me and says, come on, climb up.

542
00:35:56.24 --> 00:35:59.24
So I climbed a cockpit of a make.

543
00:35:59.24 --> 00:36:03.08
30 minutes of the air, I was in the air and that same airplane.

544
00:36:03.08 --> 00:36:06.60
You know, it's like driving your Porsche.

545
00:36:06.60 --> 00:36:07.60
Right.

546
00:36:07.60 --> 00:36:09.04
Once you can handle a Porsche.

547
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:14.60
Or my Dodge Caravan in my case, but it's all good.

548
00:36:14.60 --> 00:36:16.80
Anyhow, long wind day, answer, but no.

549
00:36:16.80 --> 00:36:17.80
It's easy.

550
00:36:17.80 --> 00:36:26.36
Once you're either a part of it and you can do it, new airplanes are exciting.

551
00:36:26.36 --> 00:36:30.32
You go on a little bit more about your checking in and you say this, the officer of the

552
00:36:30.32 --> 00:36:33.000
day said, why don't you go get your flight gear and put it in

553
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
your new locker.

554
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.88
He pointed out a bank of them in the main hanger.

555
00:36:37.88 --> 00:36:40.92
When I found my assigned locker, I opened it up to find it was full of somebody else's

556
00:36:40.92 --> 00:36:41.92
stuff.

557
00:36:41.92 --> 00:36:43.72
I think there's been a mistake I said.

558
00:36:43.72 --> 00:36:45.40
The officer of the day looked stricken.

559
00:36:45.40 --> 00:36:46.40
Sorry about that.

560
00:36:46.40 --> 00:36:48.28
We forgot to clear it out.

561
00:36:48.28 --> 00:36:49.44
Clear it out.

562
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:52.68
That locker belonged to Lieutenant J.G. replacing.

563
00:36:52.68 --> 00:36:55.56
He was killed a little while back, accident.

564
00:36:55.56 --> 00:36:57.24
Go ahead and throw everything away.

565
00:36:57.24 --> 00:36:59.80
The rest of his effects already went to his family.

566
00:36:59.80 --> 00:37:04.12
I walked back to the locker and stared at the items inside with a new perspective.

567
00:37:04.12 --> 00:37:09.72
A radiolt-teacher to hung on one hook, a few other nickmacks and toiletries sat on the shelf.

568
00:37:09.72 --> 00:37:11.40
Then I noticed something unusual.

569
00:37:11.40 --> 00:37:13.76
A pair of eyes were staring back at me.

570
00:37:13.76 --> 00:37:18.32
I reached in and pulled off the top shelf at tiny stuffed mouse.

571
00:37:18.32 --> 00:37:23.000
It was about two inches tall with big eyes, soft gray fur and a tail.

572
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.32
The toy seemed out of place in a fighter pilot's locker.

573
00:37:27.32 --> 00:37:31.68
Was it a gift to his child never delivered because of that last fatal flight?

574
00:37:31.68 --> 00:37:34.68
Was it a gift from his child to him?

575
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:40.04
If it was a lucky talisman that served as a reminder of who waited for him back home,

576
00:37:40.04 --> 00:37:43.56
I hated to think it had failed him.

577
00:37:43.56 --> 00:37:45.32
Suddenly I didn't want to know.

578
00:37:45.32 --> 00:37:47.16
Talk about an attitude adjustment.

579
00:37:47.16 --> 00:37:53.32
My problem seemed trivial, selfish compared to the death of the mouse's owner.

580
00:37:53.32 --> 00:37:55.68
I trashed the shirt and toy the trees.

581
00:37:55.68 --> 00:38:00.48
As the mouse hovered over the can, I held it there and regarded it again.

582
00:38:00.48 --> 00:38:03.28
Who might have throw away another man's mouse?

583
00:38:03.28 --> 00:38:08.44
I took the little guy back to my flight bag and made him a nest deep inside.

584
00:38:08.44 --> 00:38:13.04
That mouse is part of the whole story.

585
00:38:13.04 --> 00:38:21.000
He lives right now on about the fourth bookshelf in our library at home.

586
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.80
He's there.

587
00:38:26.80 --> 00:38:30.08
You continue on and this is what you were starting to talk about a little earlier.

588
00:38:30.08 --> 00:38:34.52
But in my squadron, the senior leadership came of age in World War 2 in Korean and the Korean

589
00:38:34.52 --> 00:38:35.52
War.

590
00:38:35.52 --> 00:38:39.96
They told us how during the Pacific War, they learned to avoid getting into a turning

591
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:43.40
dogfight with more maneuverable Japanese fighters.

592
00:38:43.40 --> 00:38:48.36
Trying to turn with more agile Japanese planes would get your tail shot off.

593
00:38:48.36 --> 00:38:50.60
They took their shot and flew away.

594
00:38:50.60 --> 00:38:53.44
One pass, Hall-Ass was the Axium.

595
00:38:53.44 --> 00:38:57.04
They learned to work together in pairs, cooperating to make sure that an enemy couldn't

596
00:38:57.04 --> 00:38:58.92
latch onto a pilot's tail.

597
00:38:58.92 --> 00:39:03.16
The other American pilot was always ready to turn towards his partner and stick his guns

598
00:39:03.16 --> 00:39:05.12
in the enemy's face.

599
00:39:05.12 --> 00:39:10.56
My flight leader Bill Armstrong explained to me that in Korea, the opposite was the case.

600
00:39:10.56 --> 00:39:16.72
The tactics of World War 2 would get a pilot killed going up against a communist Meg 15.

601
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:23.72
Those jets were faster and through higher than anything the Navy had, including the hot F-9F

602
00:39:23.72 --> 00:39:26.32
Panther-I had flown in training.

603
00:39:26.32 --> 00:39:31.44
Given the Meg speed and advantage, given the Meg speed advantage, the horizontal plane became

604
00:39:31.44 --> 00:39:33.32
the Panthers playground.

605
00:39:33.32 --> 00:39:39.84
It could outturn the Meg 15, so in just six years we changed tactics altogether.

606
00:39:39.84 --> 00:39:45.36
One pass Hall-Ass went away and US fighter pilots found their advantage in sharp turning

607
00:39:45.36 --> 00:39:47.000
dog fights.

608
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.32
In the missile age, it was all changing again.

609
00:39:50.32 --> 00:39:52.92
At least that's what the Navy believed.

610
00:39:52.92 --> 00:39:57.20
We would simply be directed by ground control to a point in the sky, lock our little circle

611
00:39:57.20 --> 00:39:59.36
on the dot and let loose with a missile.

612
00:39:59.36 --> 00:40:05.88
No more, see to the pan's flying and maneuvering in sharply turning fights.

613
00:40:05.88 --> 00:40:09.24
Technology promised a revolution.

614
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:14.24
During my time at FVA W3, the old ways were outlawed.

615
00:40:14.24 --> 00:40:20.80
Dog fighting officially known as Air Combat maneuvering or ACM was forbidden.

616
00:40:20.80 --> 00:40:24.76
In 1960, the year before I left for my next assignment, the Navy shuttered the last of the

617
00:40:24.76 --> 00:40:30.08
old schools that trained fighter pilots to dog fight, the Fleet Air Gunner Unit at

618
00:40:30.08 --> 00:40:31.48
El Central.

619
00:40:31.48 --> 00:40:35.36
From then on, Air Combat maneuvering was banned.

620
00:40:35.36 --> 00:40:40.88
If you were caught hassling, as we called dog fighting, your career could end.

621
00:40:40.88 --> 00:40:44.92
The edict against dog fighting divided our squadron into three factions.

622
00:40:44.92 --> 00:40:48.92
Our senior leadership whose experience ran countered at everything the Navy was doing now

623
00:40:48.92 --> 00:40:53.40
had fought two wars and had seen friends die.

624
00:40:53.40 --> 00:40:56.44
Having spent years away from their families on fleet deployments, they focused on being

625
00:40:56.44 --> 00:40:58.36
dads and husbands.

626
00:40:58.36 --> 00:41:02.20
At the end of their careers, they were content to mentor us nuggets on the ground, share

627
00:41:02.20 --> 00:41:05.88
experiences and teach us how to be leaders.

628
00:41:05.88 --> 00:41:08.68
They left the bulk of the flying to the younger guys.

629
00:41:08.68 --> 00:41:13.08
In the second camp, we're junior officers who bought into the new way.

630
00:41:13.08 --> 00:41:19.24
They never hassled, never pushed their sky rays to the edge of the flight envelope.

631
00:41:19.24 --> 00:41:24.16
The third group, a quiet group of young tigers, fought otherwise.

632
00:41:24.16 --> 00:41:29.16
I was one of them, and we decided to do something about it.

633
00:41:29.16 --> 00:41:34.60
A little division, little groups, little clicks of people.

634
00:41:34.60 --> 00:41:41.000
The older tired guys look, they're doing their jobs, but they're not too concerned.

635
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.80
The guys that are listening to the way the Navy is saying it's going to be done and they're

636
00:41:44.80 --> 00:41:46.60
okay with that.

637
00:41:46.60 --> 00:41:49.24
And then you guys that wanted to scrap.

638
00:41:49.24 --> 00:41:54.92
It's a matter of your personal courage.

639
00:41:54.92 --> 00:41:59.92
That's in one of your books.

640
00:41:59.92 --> 00:42:01.92
The pen on how good you want to be in the airplane.

641
00:42:01.92 --> 00:42:07.60
A lot of guys were getting ready to go with the airlines, just booking flight time to go

642
00:42:07.60 --> 00:42:09.000
with the airlines.

643
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
At this time, airline pilots made a ton of money, right?

644
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.88
Then on fur bun, 10, 20 years.

645
00:42:17.88 --> 00:42:20.80
But I never, I never even considered that.

646
00:42:20.80 --> 00:42:31.12
And I couldn't give up going to 50,000 feet in six degree climb angle, right day.

647
00:42:31.12 --> 00:42:34.000
Dave, you didn't get tempted by Delta or American?

648
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.56
I'm squarely in his cabin.

649
00:42:36.56 --> 00:42:38.80
So this is what happens.

650
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:42.96
This next chapter is called Fight Club.

651
00:42:42.96 --> 00:42:46.92
You say here off the California coast about 80 miles west of San Diego, there's a sector

652
00:42:46.92 --> 00:42:50.56
of restricted airspace that encompasses saying Clemente Island.

653
00:42:50.56 --> 00:42:52.60
It's a military reservation.

654
00:42:52.60 --> 00:42:57.96
Air controllers call it Whiskey 291, the US Navy squadrons in Southern California, use it

655
00:42:57.96 --> 00:43:00.40
for training exercises.

656
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:02.20
That was our playground.

657
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:07.56
I first heard about West's, the West Coast elicit dog fighting scene one night after

658
00:43:07.56 --> 00:43:09.40
hours in San Diego bar.

659
00:43:09.40 --> 00:43:12.72
It might have been the hotel del Coronado or a Mexican restaurant where we knocked back

660
00:43:12.72 --> 00:43:14.000
to Kila.

661
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.20
It was certainly not at the North Island officers club or in the ready room.

662
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:21.56
There were too many ears that could make things difficult.

663
00:43:21.56 --> 00:43:23.68
We were free to fly almost anywhere we wanted.

664
00:43:23.68 --> 00:43:28.60
Our squadron had plenty of aircraft and our chain of command encouraged us to get stick time.

665
00:43:28.60 --> 00:43:32.12
Almost always we could find a valid reason to fly.

666
00:43:32.12 --> 00:43:35.24
Here's the thing, you learn by doing.

667
00:43:35.24 --> 00:43:40.72
Those of us who live to fly learned our craft by flying a lot.

668
00:43:40.72 --> 00:43:44.56
One Friday afternoon after a long week on standing alert, I went to the maintenance shop

669
00:43:44.56 --> 00:43:46.52
and signed out a Ford.

670
00:43:46.52 --> 00:43:51.68
I had heard that at the bar on Friday afternoons before cocktail hour was the best time

671
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:54.44
to find our version of a street race.

672
00:43:54.44 --> 00:43:58.32
I took off from North Island and headed west for Whiskey 291.

673
00:43:58.32 --> 00:44:02.80
The unwritten rules in my mind, one of them established a hard deck at 5000 feet.

674
00:44:02.80 --> 00:44:06.36
This meant that the fight was over the moment you dip below that altitude.

675
00:44:06.36 --> 00:44:07.88
It was a nod to safety.

676
00:44:07.88 --> 00:44:12.60
If you ran into trouble and entered a spin, you needed that altitude to recover.

677
00:44:12.60 --> 00:44:18.08
By joining this fight club, we were keeping the flame alive for a certain way of being

678
00:44:18.08 --> 00:44:19.80
a fighter pilot.

679
00:44:19.80 --> 00:44:21.16
It was also serious.

680
00:44:21.16 --> 00:44:24.44
We were preserving our birthright as naval aviators.

681
00:44:24.44 --> 00:44:28.88
But first time I went out there south of Sanctuary, I was amazed at what I found.

682
00:44:28.88 --> 00:44:35.60
Marine A4 Skyhawks Air National Guard F86L interceptors Air Force F100 Super Sabers

683
00:44:35.60 --> 00:44:38.72
and lots of Navy guys flying F8 crew savers.

684
00:44:38.72 --> 00:44:41.24
There were even a few other forwards from North Island.

685
00:44:41.24 --> 00:44:46.28
The word had spread far beyond the Navy community and the services mixed it up with fierce

686
00:44:46.28 --> 00:44:51.20
relish because they all were going through the same institutional evolution away from

687
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:57.84
air combat that we and naval aviation were experiencing.

688
00:44:57.84 --> 00:44:59.36
You this is classic.

689
00:44:59.36 --> 00:45:01.88
I learned the ropes that first time out.

690
00:45:01.88 --> 00:45:06.24
Pick your opponent, roll up alongside and give the signal.

691
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:08.36
The signal being the bird.

692
00:45:08.36 --> 00:45:09.76
So you flip the guy off.

693
00:45:09.76 --> 00:45:11.16
That's how you kick this thing off.

694
00:45:11.16 --> 00:45:12.96
Let's say you're initiated.

695
00:45:12.96 --> 00:45:17.84
A smile in the wave and a 45 degree bank in opposite break in opposite directions.

696
00:45:17.84 --> 00:45:20.68
A break means we rolled the wings and turned one way.

697
00:45:20.68 --> 00:45:23.20
The guy to the left broke left 45 degrees left.

698
00:45:23.20 --> 00:45:25.16
The guy on the right broke 45 degrees right.

699
00:45:25.16 --> 00:45:26.76
We'd extend our way.

700
00:45:26.76 --> 00:45:31.32
We'd extend out away from each other for several seconds until we were a few miles distance.

701
00:45:31.32 --> 00:45:33.08
Then we began the fight.

702
00:45:33.08 --> 00:45:37.58
We turned into each other pushing fronals forward in what to the uninitiated look like an

703
00:45:37.58 --> 00:45:40.60
aerial game of chicken in Mach 1 fighters.

704
00:45:40.60 --> 00:45:42.000
We're pushing head to head or close to it.

705
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.68
Two fighters inevitably passed each other close aboard.

706
00:45:46.68 --> 00:45:48.72
We called this the merge.

707
00:45:48.72 --> 00:45:52.92
Closing somewhere north of a combined thousand miles an hour meant the merge is over in

708
00:45:52.92 --> 00:45:54.40
mere three seconds.

709
00:45:54.40 --> 00:45:58.36
Before a collision we'd break away showing our first best move.

710
00:45:58.36 --> 00:46:00.08
That was when the hassle began.

711
00:46:00.08 --> 00:46:02.72
There was no script for what happened after the merge.

712
00:46:02.72 --> 00:46:05.80
We reacted to each other flying our aircraft as best we could.

713
00:46:05.80 --> 00:46:07.72
We learned that power is king.

714
00:46:07.72 --> 00:46:11.76
More gives you the ability to climb above a fight to re-enter it with even more energy and

715
00:46:11.76 --> 00:46:13.16
a diving attack.

716
00:46:13.16 --> 00:46:18.000
Power means you can push your bird in a tighter and tighter turn and maintain the air

717
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.12
speed longer.

718
00:46:20.12 --> 00:46:24.04
When we had enough and were ready to admit defeat, maybe our opponent gained position

719
00:46:24.04 --> 00:46:26.000
at six o'clock and never let go.

720
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.24
We waggle our wings, pulled up the long side our opponent and flew wing to wing.

721
00:46:31.24 --> 00:46:34.84
Sometimes we smiled unseen behind our oxygen masks and waved.

722
00:46:34.84 --> 00:46:36.52
Nice flight brother.

723
00:46:36.52 --> 00:46:40.20
Sometimes we just eyeball each other pissed off that somebody had gotten the better of

724
00:46:40.20 --> 00:46:41.20
us.

725
00:46:41.20 --> 00:46:45.32
Invariably out there there was someone a little better than I was but each time I went

726
00:46:45.32 --> 00:46:52.32
out, when or lose I improved.

727
00:46:52.32 --> 00:46:54.80
How fun was that?

728
00:46:54.80 --> 00:46:57.48
And I pay you to go to you know.

729
00:46:57.48 --> 00:47:00.80
And it sounds like at this time you had unlimited fuel unlimited.

730
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:04.60
You do this as much as you possibly want.

731
00:47:04.60 --> 00:47:10.68
And maybe I bought some Douglas Skyrares Batwing airplane took the guns out which was

732
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:19.20
a shame but getting ready for missile stuff.

733
00:47:19.20 --> 00:47:23.52
It wasn't a great carer plane because it allowed rules stability.

734
00:47:23.52 --> 00:47:24.92
It was pretty dangerous.

735
00:47:24.92 --> 00:47:27.72
Kill a lot of guys on the aircraft carer.

736
00:47:27.72 --> 00:47:32.68
They're in the initial phase of trials with the airplane.

737
00:47:32.68 --> 00:47:38.08
So they sent them all to be at the F.A.N.P. 3 and it would climb like nothing you ever

738
00:47:38.08 --> 00:47:39.08
seen.

739
00:47:39.08 --> 00:47:41.72
Just cram it and burn her and hang on.

740
00:47:41.72 --> 00:47:49.76
A stick with about six inches high just block her arm and break her gone 30 degrees.

741
00:47:49.76 --> 00:47:54.16
Go to 60 degrees and go to 50,000 feet.

742
00:47:54.16 --> 00:47:58.48
You know that's a neat ticket ride and anybody's book.

743
00:47:58.48 --> 00:48:02.36
Dave did you have any experience where you...

744
00:48:02.36 --> 00:48:06.28
And we're the Marine Corps didn't know what you were doing but you were out with a bunch

745
00:48:06.28 --> 00:48:10.12
of your friends and the Navy and the Air Force scrapping.

746
00:48:10.12 --> 00:48:15.72
And I don't know what the statue of limitations is on this and if you can still get trouble

747
00:48:15.72 --> 00:48:16.72
at this time.

748
00:48:16.72 --> 00:48:18.48
No I'm safe now.

749
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:20.48
It's not like what you ain't just talking about.

750
00:48:20.48 --> 00:48:22.44
There isn't an illicit thing.

751
00:48:22.44 --> 00:48:29.04
What there would be is four guys in the squadron going on the road together.

752
00:48:29.04 --> 00:48:30.56
Everybody knew we were going.

753
00:48:30.56 --> 00:48:34.36
And we would do things very similar when we talked about is we would...

754
00:48:34.36 --> 00:48:37.000
We would do things that badly we weren't supposed to be doing.

755
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.28
And we were doing another guy is now there was a degree of safety in the organizations

756
00:48:40.28 --> 00:48:44.000
that communities had come a long way because of what they learned.

757
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.92
But man we would...

758
00:48:45.92 --> 00:48:49.60
I have done a lot of things in an airplane that if I had a came back and told my boss

759
00:48:49.60 --> 00:48:50.60
I did it.

760
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:52.60
We would have a real problem.

761
00:48:52.60 --> 00:48:55.80
And more than anything it's the culture that that generation created.

762
00:48:55.80 --> 00:49:00.52
We were smart about safety we do a lot of things that to keep the airplanes in us safe.

763
00:49:00.52 --> 00:49:02.40
But man that spirit and that culture I'm just...

764
00:49:02.40 --> 00:49:06.24
I mean I'm grinning ear to ear listening to this because that's where this all came from

765
00:49:06.24 --> 00:49:08.20
was pushing against the organization.

766
00:49:08.20 --> 00:49:10.24
These are things we have to do and look...

767
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:13.56
There's a lot of things I wouldn't tell anybody about.

768
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:17.24
You know, while I was doing it looking back on and now it's actually kind of fun to think

769
00:49:17.24 --> 00:49:18.24
about it.

770
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:21.12
Man we did some going on the road for ship out of Miramar.

771
00:49:21.12 --> 00:49:23.64
Man you had a license to steal.

772
00:49:23.64 --> 00:49:24.64
It was awesome.

773
00:49:24.64 --> 00:49:29.20
You know you mentioned this earlier which I read.

774
00:49:29.20 --> 00:49:37.04
We talked about the naval aviation being the rebel branch of the Navy.

775
00:49:37.04 --> 00:49:40.96
And you know that attitude right there.

776
00:49:40.96 --> 00:49:45.52
If you don't have that rebel attitude this these thoughts don't even enter your mind

777
00:49:45.52 --> 00:49:47.20
to push the envelope like this.

778
00:49:47.20 --> 00:49:50.76
You know you're dealing in human life.

779
00:49:50.76 --> 00:49:58.68
You all understand that fully I know when you're every day it's not just fun flying.

780
00:49:58.68 --> 00:50:01.40
It's serious business.

781
00:50:01.40 --> 00:50:05.40
It's perfect professional excellence.

782
00:50:05.40 --> 00:50:06.84
And you keep building it.

783
00:50:06.84 --> 00:50:14.88
You gotta remember we're talking about the fight club being illegal in the 58-59 and

784
00:50:14.88 --> 00:50:18.56
60-61.

785
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:25.24
And then for the next four years it was still semi-alegal.

786
00:50:25.24 --> 00:50:30.000
And then along came a four which we'll get to and then sure.

787
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.76
And it became it was it was the menu of the day.

788
00:50:38.76 --> 00:50:42.32
Haslan was kind of wish everybody could ask.

789
00:50:42.32 --> 00:50:43.76
Again your butt kicked out.

790
00:50:43.76 --> 00:50:45.48
Turned Vietnam.

791
00:50:45.48 --> 00:50:54.16
And all the stuff we learned back in the 58-59-60 it was easy to sell it.

792
00:50:54.16 --> 00:51:00.20
Yeah you talk about here you say I learned the basics of air combat in those hassles

793
00:51:00.20 --> 00:51:02.20
never lose sight of your opponent.

794
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:03.80
Lucite lose the fight.

795
00:51:03.80 --> 00:51:05.68
Never go vertical unless you can own it.

796
00:51:05.68 --> 00:51:09.12
Meaning you have to have enough pure engine power to blast guy or to leave your opponent

797
00:51:09.12 --> 00:51:13.52
unable to follow you and hammer you from behind.

798
00:51:13.52 --> 00:51:15.72
Turning fights are like back alley brawls.

799
00:51:15.72 --> 00:51:19.80
When similar aircraft engage like that the difference is pilot skill and aggressiveness.

800
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:25.36
The winner usually is the one with the most guts to push his aircraft to its aerodynamic

801
00:51:25.36 --> 00:51:26.60
limit.

802
00:51:26.60 --> 00:51:32.12
In this way we preserved our perishable skills, our perishable skill sets and kept alive

803
00:51:32.12 --> 00:51:34.20
the fading art of the dogfight.

804
00:51:34.20 --> 00:51:37.56
The rest of the navy was letting it slip away in the early 1960s.

805
00:51:37.56 --> 00:51:39.08
I flew whenever I could.

806
00:51:39.08 --> 00:51:43.000
Holidays were a great time to hassle because the married guys were at home with their

807
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.44
families and the pace of the activity on base relaxed.

808
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:51.92
I was still trying to get over Mary Beth so I'd climb in a forward and go look for a good

809
00:51:51.92 --> 00:51:54.72
fight.

810
00:51:54.72 --> 00:51:55.72
This is also important.

811
00:51:55.72 --> 00:51:57.80
Fighting against different types of planes was useful.

812
00:51:57.80 --> 00:52:02.12
It taught me more than fighting against the same type of plane I was piloting.

813
00:52:02.12 --> 00:52:07.36
In years and later years at top gone we would call it dissimilar air combat training.

814
00:52:07.36 --> 00:52:10.56
But back in the late 1950s we didn't have a name for it.

815
00:52:10.56 --> 00:52:14.68
We just we just intuitively based on experience.

816
00:52:14.68 --> 00:52:19.40
Each fight with a different type of aircraft, each with its own advantages and weaknesses,

817
00:52:19.40 --> 00:52:23.64
taught us how to exploit our edge and minimize theirs.

818
00:52:23.64 --> 00:52:24.92
How did we learn?

819
00:52:24.92 --> 00:52:25.92
By losing.

820
00:52:25.92 --> 00:52:27.28
Failure is a teacher.

821
00:52:27.28 --> 00:52:31.84
Be honest with yourself, extract the lessons and you'll never make that error again.

822
00:52:31.84 --> 00:52:36.68
I spent many long flights back to North Island, repaying what I did wrong so that on my

823
00:52:36.68 --> 00:52:42.80
next bout in the inner service flight club I'd bring the heat and wind and wind.

824
00:52:42.80 --> 00:52:48.40
When we found a top gun this part of the experience in whiskey 2-9-1 became a very important

825
00:52:48.40 --> 00:52:50.72
component of our culture.

826
00:52:50.72 --> 00:52:53.72
That's what my point was.

827
00:52:53.72 --> 00:52:56.56
All of a sudden it wasn't illegal.

828
00:52:56.56 --> 00:52:58.96
It's we need something like this.

829
00:52:58.96 --> 00:53:01.44
Can you teach us how?

830
00:53:01.44 --> 00:53:05.72
And it worked.

831
00:53:05.72 --> 00:53:10.000
You end up going on deployment.

832
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
I'm skipping ahead a little bit.

833
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.24
The very first cruise game of front row seats to the US Navy Power Projection in action.

834
00:53:16.24 --> 00:53:20.08
Deployed to West Park, we guarded the sea lanes, trained off the coast of Japan and flew

835
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:22.60
the flag at various ports of call.

836
00:53:22.60 --> 00:53:28.04
Our F3HDmen's intercepted Soviet bombers that periodically dropped down to snoop on us.

837
00:53:28.04 --> 00:53:31.60
We chased them as soon as our radar was caught them.

838
00:53:31.60 --> 00:53:36.84
When the TU-95 bears took their photos of us, we wanted a demon in the frame.

839
00:53:36.84 --> 00:53:41.40
We got our ability to destroy them at will, was a game we played with the Russians for the

840
00:53:41.40 --> 00:53:43.44
entire Cold War.

841
00:53:43.44 --> 00:53:47.52
More than once I watched a Russian gunner wave at me as I snapped pictures through the

842
00:53:47.52 --> 00:53:48.52
canopy.

843
00:53:48.52 --> 00:53:52.76
Such moments were rare in fleeting just too aircrew at the tip of the spear making

844
00:53:52.76 --> 00:53:59.48
momentary personal contact at altitude over the world's largest ocean.

845
00:53:59.48 --> 00:54:06.32
And they usually showed playboy magazine which was newer than we had on the curve.

846
00:54:06.32 --> 00:54:13.20
It was a game, you know, the news media now makes it sound so serious.

847
00:54:13.20 --> 00:54:15.20
It was a game.

848
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:18.48
They just competitive, what could you do?

849
00:54:18.48 --> 00:54:27.32
One time I was out, pull up alongside a bear flying a later on flying a fan in my call

850
00:54:27.32 --> 00:54:31.32
time for my back seat or was a little hot.

851
00:54:31.32 --> 00:54:37.32
And he, I look in the mirror and we're sitting right next to this bear.

852
00:54:37.32 --> 00:54:44.04
And in the back seat it's a plastic pink rabbit.

853
00:54:44.04 --> 00:54:46.24
He's inflated rabbit.

854
00:54:46.24 --> 00:54:52.000
And the only thing to make or the only thing to bear guys can see in their alls in the

855
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.32
back turret back there trying to look over and laughing because he's put a pink rabbit

856
00:54:58.32 --> 00:54:59.32
up.

857
00:54:59.32 --> 00:55:02.32
He's got a stick.

858
00:55:02.32 --> 00:55:03.32
A little humor.

859
00:55:03.32 --> 00:55:06.32
But it was, it was no work.

860
00:55:06.32 --> 00:55:08.72
Yeah, that's awesome.

861
00:55:08.72 --> 00:55:11.04
You never done anything like that in Marine Corps, did you?

862
00:55:11.04 --> 00:55:14.88
I was, I was lucky enough to intercept a bear on my first cruise.

863
00:55:14.88 --> 00:55:18.64
I have just a legendary shot of me in a hornet up against a bear.

864
00:55:18.64 --> 00:55:20.28
I got to intercept an Iranian.

865
00:55:20.28 --> 00:55:23.84
I think it was kind of their version of the C130 right on the line there in the Gulf

866
00:55:23.84 --> 00:55:24.84
pull up alongside.

867
00:55:24.84 --> 00:55:29.28
And re-living or living for the first time these stories I had heard about for literally

868
00:55:29.28 --> 00:55:37.56
decades, looking at the window of my fighter at a Iranian cargo plane flying, he's on his

869
00:55:37.56 --> 00:55:38.56
side of the line.

870
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:44.08
On my side there's probably a hundred feet, 200 feet between us, waving maybe some other

871
00:55:44.08 --> 00:55:45.40
hand signals along the way.

872
00:55:45.40 --> 00:55:49.000
But those are things that those are pictures of him in your mind.

873
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.56
You'll never forget those things.

874
00:55:50.56 --> 00:55:53.92
The first time I intercepted a bear on an alert seven launch off a carrier just sitting

875
00:55:53.92 --> 00:55:55.56
in the cockpit, launch off.

876
00:55:55.56 --> 00:55:57.76
I go 20, you know, 12 minutes later.

877
00:55:57.76 --> 00:56:03.44
I'm in parade off of a bear just thinking how many times has happened for me for anybody

878
00:56:03.44 --> 00:56:04.44
else before.

879
00:56:04.44 --> 00:56:09.96
It was a bear and say, love to come down and go fast and ride along the way.

880
00:56:09.96 --> 00:56:10.96
That could occur.

881
00:56:10.96 --> 00:56:14.20
They'll make a low pass on the carrier.

882
00:56:14.20 --> 00:56:16.40
So you got to be, you got to be in the picture.

883
00:56:16.40 --> 00:56:20.08
I got to let them know that you have been there the whole time.

884
00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:22.08
The only because of you are they getting to do that.

885
00:56:22.08 --> 00:56:27.24
So it's a cool history to say I got to do that.

886
00:56:27.24 --> 00:56:34.28
Speaking of always, oh, all business, we say here we broke out above the cloud layer at

887
00:56:34.28 --> 00:56:36.20
15,000 feet and I'm fast-forwarding.

888
00:56:36.20 --> 00:56:37.56
No moon, no visible horizon.

889
00:56:37.56 --> 00:56:40.96
My demon suffered electrical failure and the lights went out in the cockpit.

890
00:56:40.96 --> 00:56:45.16
A wind powered auxiliary unit was supposed to deploy in such a situation but that failed

891
00:56:45.16 --> 00:56:46.16
as well.

892
00:56:46.16 --> 00:56:51.44
There I was surrounded by absolute darkness using a 90 degree angled flashlight to periodically

893
00:56:51.44 --> 00:56:52.76
check my instruments.

894
00:56:52.76 --> 00:56:56.12
I was flying that mission with our squadron executive officer Lieutenant Commander Joe

895
00:56:56.12 --> 00:57:00.16
Paulk who realized my predicament and came to my rescue.

896
00:57:00.16 --> 00:57:05.000
Joe sent a signal to me with his flashlight, followed me and pointed to the handcocks

897
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
latest position.

898
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.40
It was an eerie sensation flying on his wing in the dark on route to the handcocks

899
00:57:11.40 --> 00:57:12.68
waiting deck.

900
00:57:12.68 --> 00:57:19.08
I forced myself to keep my wings level relative to his wing and belly navigation lights.

901
00:57:19.08 --> 00:57:25.36
I used small precise control inputs made easier by Joe's smooth flying.

902
00:57:25.36 --> 00:57:29.68
We broke out of the cloud layer about a mile and a half a stern of the ship.

903
00:57:29.68 --> 00:57:32.04
We could see the white strobes back in us.

904
00:57:32.04 --> 00:57:36.52
I continued flying Joe's wing until his lights went out and he turned away to give

905
00:57:36.52 --> 00:57:38.72
me a clear shot at the deck.

906
00:57:38.72 --> 00:57:42.44
The electrical failure had knocked out my radio which meant I could not talk to the landing

907
00:57:42.44 --> 00:57:43.72
signal officer.

908
00:57:43.72 --> 00:57:45.28
All I could do was watch his lights.

909
00:57:45.28 --> 00:57:49.32
A green one meant keep coming flashing reds would be the dreaded wave off, go around

910
00:57:49.32 --> 00:57:50.72
and try again.

911
00:57:50.72 --> 00:57:52.76
I didn't have enough fuel for that.

912
00:57:52.76 --> 00:57:57.48
So if I missed, I'd have to eject, trusting that someone would find me in the stormy

913
00:57:57.48 --> 00:57:58.48
sea.

914
00:57:58.48 --> 00:58:02.12
I made it down and felt the tail hook catch one of the deck wires.

915
00:58:02.12 --> 00:58:04.32
The demon lurched to a hole.

916
00:58:04.32 --> 00:58:06.48
A close call for sure but it was nover.

917
00:58:06.48 --> 00:58:11.000
The next night while flying the same demon, the same thing happened again.

918
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.68
I was on Joe's wing and he brought me back to the handcocks for an encore performance.

919
00:58:15.68 --> 00:58:18.92
I landed safely after another gut check approach.

920
00:58:18.92 --> 00:58:23.96
Perhaps we joked about him saving me twice.

921
00:58:23.96 --> 00:58:26.28
The interracing point on an end, Joe.

922
00:58:26.28 --> 00:58:28.64
You mean beyond the fastest landing at the weekend?

923
00:58:28.64 --> 00:58:32.24
Yeah, you're reading a lot of the book.

924
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:39.68
And the next paragraph says, can't figure out two nights in a row and happened to me.

925
00:58:39.68 --> 00:58:46.52
And they are playing flu during the daylight hours successfully with no electrical failure

926
00:58:46.52 --> 00:58:48.88
in between that do event.

927
00:58:48.88 --> 00:58:52.08
I started to get spooked a little bit.

928
00:58:52.08 --> 00:58:54.80
What somebody said me a message.

929
00:58:54.80 --> 00:59:01.60
Yeah, and the reason I brought that or the reason I wanted to read that is, look, it's

930
00:59:01.60 --> 00:59:03.60
peace time, it doesn't matter.

931
00:59:03.60 --> 00:59:08.20
When you're flying and landing on an aircraft carrier and the weather and mechanical failures,

932
00:59:08.20 --> 00:59:12.48
I used to say this about I would tell the young seals when you go out and do water

933
00:59:12.48 --> 00:59:15.88
operations, everything you do is a real world mission.

934
00:59:15.88 --> 00:59:20.32
Is that the ocean can kill you if you make a mistake, you die.

935
00:59:20.32 --> 00:59:24.72
And I used to say that pre-war, you know, in the 90s when I would try to be get guys to

936
00:59:24.72 --> 00:59:29.48
make sure they're taking stuff seriously and not gaffing off procedures.

937
00:59:29.48 --> 00:59:30.48
And it's the same thing here.

938
00:59:30.48 --> 00:59:34.16
I mean, I can't just this idea.

939
00:59:34.16 --> 00:59:38.36
And I'm pretty sure I know the angled flashlight that you're talking about is probably

940
00:59:38.36 --> 00:59:40.76
the same, yeah, that piece of crap.

941
00:59:40.76 --> 00:59:41.76
You're lucky.

942
00:59:41.76 --> 00:59:42.76
That thing didn't fail.

943
00:59:42.76 --> 00:59:43.76
Green one.

944
00:59:43.76 --> 00:59:44.76
Yeah.

945
00:59:44.76 --> 00:59:45.76
Yeah.

946
00:59:45.76 --> 00:59:51.48
And then the other thought that thing I thought was awesome about this was Joe knowing.

947
00:59:51.48 --> 00:59:55.76
All right, I'm going to guide him right in and then I'm going to black myself out.

948
00:59:55.76 --> 00:59:57.60
I'm going to get out of his way and it's on you.

949
00:59:57.60 --> 00:59:59.96
You just, you guys can't even talk, but you know what to do.

950
00:59:59.96 --> 01:00:01.32
He knows what to do.

951
01:00:01.32 --> 01:00:04.28
The guy that's landing, you know what to do.

952
01:00:04.28 --> 01:00:06.28
That's awesome.

953
01:00:06.28 --> 01:00:08.28
That's the naval aviation training.

954
01:00:08.28 --> 01:00:09.28
There it is.

955
01:00:09.28 --> 01:00:10.28
Right, Nate.

956
01:00:10.28 --> 01:00:12.28
Hey, man.

957
01:00:12.28 --> 01:00:17.000
Go on here, you say Mary Beth had gotten married to her football player.

958
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.88
I never tried to win her back.

959
01:00:18.88 --> 01:00:21.48
And that was on the, you talk about this is on the advice of your mom.

960
01:00:21.48 --> 01:00:24.16
He said, don't, no, you let her go.

961
01:00:24.16 --> 01:00:26.84
Her marriage was the final nail in the coffin of my wishful thinking.

962
01:00:26.84 --> 01:00:28.44
I had let her go.

963
01:00:28.44 --> 01:00:30.48
Eventually I met a wonderful girl.

964
01:00:30.48 --> 01:00:35.88
A wonderful young woman in Coronado, Maddie, and married her 1959 a year later, our daughter

965
01:00:35.88 --> 01:00:37.16
Dana arrived.

966
01:00:37.16 --> 01:00:43.84
My wife and I began a 17 year journey in Navy life with far too much of it spent to park.

967
01:00:43.84 --> 01:00:46.12
Flying as a dangerous game of risk and reward.

968
01:00:46.12 --> 01:00:47.96
Push too far and you pay the price.

969
01:00:47.96 --> 01:00:53.32
Before I joined the black lines, I only had to look out for myself and my squadron mates.

970
01:00:53.32 --> 01:00:54.32
Different game now.

971
01:00:54.32 --> 01:00:59.12
I live for two others who depend on me becoming a family man, coincided with my first

972
01:00:59.12 --> 01:01:02.36
fleet assignment on board the handcock.

973
01:01:02.36 --> 01:01:05.88
My 1962 deployment lasted from February to November.

974
01:01:05.88 --> 01:01:09.52
We got back to the West Coast and started training for the next one, running simulated

975
01:01:09.52 --> 01:01:13.48
intercepts in our demons three or four nights a week on that schedule.

976
01:01:13.48 --> 01:01:16.04
Even when we were home, we were really not home.

977
01:01:16.04 --> 01:01:21.48
Our 1963 deployment began in the spring and being home after being home for less than six

978
01:01:21.48 --> 01:01:22.48
months.

979
01:01:22.48 --> 01:01:27.80
Hugs, good buys, tears on cheeks, Dana's little hand pressed into mine.

980
01:01:27.80 --> 01:01:32.32
Then back to the ship to manage a long distance relationship through handwritten letters, voice

981
01:01:32.32 --> 01:01:36.44
messages on cassette tapes and an occasional phone call.

982
01:01:36.44 --> 01:01:39.12
The second parting for my family was worse than the first.

983
01:01:39.12 --> 01:01:43.52
I didn't want to be a stranger to my own daughter but what choice did I have?

984
01:01:43.52 --> 01:01:44.92
The Navy wanted me to go.

985
01:01:44.92 --> 01:01:47.44
The Navy needed me to go to the other side of the Pacific.

986
01:01:47.44 --> 01:01:55.92
It was my sworn duty to go.

987
01:01:55.92 --> 01:01:58.60
After ten years flying fighters, now you're on deployment.

988
01:01:58.60 --> 01:02:00.64
After ten years of, and I'm fast-forwarding.

989
01:02:00.64 --> 01:02:03.32
After ten years of flying fighters, I felt ready and confident.

990
01:02:03.32 --> 01:02:09.40
I'd ace the F4 training at VF-121, the West Coast Replacement Air Group Rag for the

991
01:02:09.40 --> 01:02:10.64
Phantom community.

992
01:02:10.64 --> 01:02:14.76
The squadron prepared all new F4 crews for their Vietnam deployments.

993
01:02:14.76 --> 01:02:20.48
We flew constantly training hard at our beyond visual range missile intercepts.

994
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:25.04
We even got to shoot at a drone with a sparrow, one of the only times I'd actually

995
01:02:25.04 --> 01:02:28.96
fired one of these high tech weapons.

996
01:02:28.96 --> 01:02:31.80
So you guys get the F4 fan of now.

997
01:02:31.80 --> 01:02:34.000
I think that's my favorite American aircraft.

998
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I don't know.

999
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.12
I'm actually sure it is my favorite American aircraft.

1000
01:02:39.12 --> 01:02:43.52
I guess the second maybe the Coursaire, the World War II Coursaire.

1001
01:02:43.52 --> 01:02:45.80
Obviously, but then you got the P-5.

1002
01:02:45.80 --> 01:02:46.80
Okay.

1003
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:48.60
We'll go down that.

1004
01:02:48.60 --> 01:02:50.76
But you're flying the F4 fan of.

1005
01:02:50.76 --> 01:02:55.96
And that's once again, this is the space craft on bus.

1006
01:02:55.96 --> 01:03:00.08
That's beautiful.

1007
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:01.88
That's the bird that they have at Pensacola.

1008
01:03:01.88 --> 01:03:02.88
Did you go to Pensacola Dave?

1009
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:03.88
I did.

1010
01:03:03.88 --> 01:03:04.88
Yeah.

1011
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:09.000
That's the bird that they have in the like the premier spot at Pensacola, the big

1012
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.48
giant one sitting where you marched by every day.

1013
01:03:13.48 --> 01:03:14.80
So that's what you're flying.

1014
01:03:14.80 --> 01:03:18.04
And now you're on deployment.

1015
01:03:18.04 --> 01:03:21.88
You go to Pearl Harbor for a little while after a few days in Pearl, we were on a way

1016
01:03:21.88 --> 01:03:30.28
west to Sassabo, Japan, our rival was met by massive protests, student and radicals opposed

1017
01:03:30.28 --> 01:03:32.52
to the Vietnam War.

1018
01:03:32.52 --> 01:03:35.96
When the carrier or a scony, how you say that?

1019
01:03:35.96 --> 01:03:37.24
A risk in me.

1020
01:03:37.24 --> 01:03:42.40
When the carrier or a risk in me called it Sassabo, around the same time we did, we learned

1021
01:03:42.40 --> 01:03:49.16
that its air wing had lost half its aircraft over North Vietnam.

1022
01:03:49.16 --> 01:03:54.32
It suffered a third of its air crews either killed, wounded, or missing in action.

1023
01:03:54.32 --> 01:04:00.96
Their casualty list eventually included Lieutenant J.G. John McCain, future senator from Arizona

1024
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:05.08
who is captured in October 1967.

1025
01:04:05.08 --> 01:04:10.12
Only a few weeks before our ships crossed paths, one of the F8 pilots, Lieutenant Commander

1026
01:04:10.12 --> 01:04:16.68
Dick Sheifert, fought an epic duel against six North Vietnamese megs, 17s and meg 21s.

1027
01:04:16.68 --> 01:04:21.84
It had been escorting an A4 Skyhawk strike when they were attacked, Sheifert fired all

1028
01:04:21.84 --> 01:04:26.92
three of his side-winder missiles, but each malfunctioned or missed.

1029
01:04:26.92 --> 01:04:31.12
When he switched to his 20-millimeter cannon, the hijie maneuvering jammed the pneumatic

1030
01:04:31.12 --> 01:04:33.92
feed system, leaving him defenseless.

1031
01:04:33.92 --> 01:04:39.000
Nevertheless, he stalemated the migs with an exceptional display of flying before slipping

1032
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.72
away on the dregs of his remaining fuel.

1033
01:04:41.72 --> 01:04:46.64
The fighters showed up a moment later and downed one of the migs, they fired seven missiles

1034
01:04:46.64 --> 01:04:53.20
in that fight, only one hit.

1035
01:04:53.20 --> 01:04:58.52
So this is where, and you're going to, the history in this is awesome, talking about the

1036
01:04:58.52 --> 01:05:01.56
weapon systems, talking about the failures you're talking about.

1037
01:05:01.56 --> 01:05:05.72
It's not only the pilots, not getting trained the way they should be, but the weapon systems

1038
01:05:05.72 --> 01:05:08.04
aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing.

1039
01:05:08.04 --> 01:05:13.20
This idea of intercept fighting was, hey, we're going to stay 12 miles away.

1040
01:05:13.20 --> 01:05:19.56
I lock on my missile system, I shoot it, and then I run away, and the missile does the job.

1041
01:05:19.56 --> 01:05:27.16
That was what the plan was from the Pentagon, and from the brass.

1042
01:05:27.16 --> 01:05:35.52
That's, you know, industry designs on the NA Billum, and we fly in what we're given.

1043
01:05:35.52 --> 01:05:44.96
And each subject you've read about here is leading up to why top-cun was formed.

1044
01:05:44.96 --> 01:05:48.08
In other words, the missiles never worked.

1045
01:05:48.08 --> 01:05:51.36
They're big, they're expensive.

1046
01:05:51.36 --> 01:05:55.000
How you handle them on the aircraft carriers, another problem.

1047
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.20
They're all problems.

1048
01:05:57.20 --> 01:06:01.80
You know, somebody paid for them, they were paid for them, they sent them a fleet, and they

1049
01:06:01.80 --> 01:06:02.80
don't work.

1050
01:06:02.80 --> 01:06:09.40
But in peace time, you never use them in anger, so you don't know that.

1051
01:06:09.40 --> 01:06:16.32
The Phantom was designed one way, Mac Billed a beautiful airplane, but it was designed

1052
01:06:16.32 --> 01:06:18.40
as an interceptor.

1053
01:06:18.40 --> 01:06:22.24
We had never had it in combat.

1054
01:06:22.24 --> 01:06:31.44
And all these situations you're talking about lead to top-cun failure make it better right

1055
01:06:31.44 --> 01:06:33.68
now.

1056
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:39.28
The time frame they gave us was two months, but the graduate school together, we've

1057
01:06:39.28 --> 01:06:43.68
been doing this for five years of war in the name working.

1058
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:48.28
So you could even be a couple months, put a graduate school.

1059
01:06:48.28 --> 01:06:55.28
Initially, though the original nine guys or eight guys who were with me, we were trying

1060
01:06:55.28 --> 01:07:00.48
to figure out whether we were getting sandbagged, you know, whether somebody was setting

1061
01:07:00.48 --> 01:07:05.24
us up, you believe it on young guys, they couldn't cut it.

1062
01:07:05.24 --> 01:07:09.000
Well, we didn't turn out quite that way.

1063
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:18.36
So anyhow, all I want to make point is a lot of what you're reading is how and why

1064
01:07:18.36 --> 01:07:22.16
and top-cun ended up and the more about there.

1065
01:07:22.16 --> 01:07:27.96
Yeah, I know it's the way you lay the pieces out of how it comes to fruition is history.

1066
01:07:27.96 --> 01:07:30.04
I don't think a lot of people know about it.

1067
01:07:30.04 --> 01:07:38.12
No, they only know about the movie, top-cun original movie.

1068
01:07:38.12 --> 01:07:43.52
There's a little situation, a little scenario that unfolds in Korea.

1069
01:07:43.52 --> 01:07:51.60
There's a little problem and you end up having to go up there and you arrive on stage,

1070
01:07:51.60 --> 01:07:54.76
you're going back to the book, we arrive on stage to face terrible winter weather.

1071
01:07:54.76 --> 01:07:59.08
We sailed through blizzard and snow squalls that left us unable to see the end of the flight

1072
01:07:59.08 --> 01:08:01.92
deck from the ship's island.

1073
01:08:01.92 --> 01:08:03.92
The flight deck turned out to be covered in ice.

1074
01:08:03.92 --> 01:08:08.08
The crew had to assist us to our F4 fanom so we didn't slip and fall.

1075
01:08:08.08 --> 01:08:12.96
Once in the cockpit, we were towed to the catapult so we didn't slide around on the ice.

1076
01:08:12.96 --> 01:08:16.04
A night cat shot is always an experience.

1077
01:08:16.04 --> 01:08:18.92
Add snow flaries and heavy seas and you've got a real adventure.

1078
01:08:18.92 --> 01:08:21.08
We climbed it once you launched it.

1079
01:08:21.08 --> 01:08:25.36
We climbed above 20,000 feet but never broke free in the storm.

1080
01:08:25.36 --> 01:08:28.52
It was so thick that Skank and I couldn't even see each other.

1081
01:08:28.52 --> 01:08:32.80
My back seat or dentist stuffy tracked him on radar and we followed a few miles behind.

1082
01:08:32.80 --> 01:08:35.12
Snow and ice last our fanom's.

1083
01:08:35.12 --> 01:08:37.76
The wind screen was a kaleidoscope of snowflakes.

1084
01:08:37.76 --> 01:08:39.68
It was like flying through a snow globe.

1085
01:08:39.68 --> 01:08:44.04
The enterprise finally vectored us to a holding pattern before we returned to the ship.

1086
01:08:44.04 --> 01:08:47.92
As our approach time grew near, I thought it strange that they never gave us a weather

1087
01:08:47.92 --> 01:08:48.92
report.

1088
01:08:48.92 --> 01:08:52.48
We started our dissense individually through the heart of the blizzard.

1089
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:54.52
Visibility was almost nil.

1090
01:08:54.52 --> 01:09:00.92
Skank went into land first guided by radar from the ship. He saw nothing on that first approach.

1091
01:09:00.92 --> 01:09:03.32
He saw nothing on that first approach.

1092
01:09:03.32 --> 01:09:07.40
No lights, no carrier, just blizzard and blackness.

1093
01:09:07.40 --> 01:09:13.04
This landing signal officer said, you sounded good when you went by us.

1094
01:09:13.04 --> 01:09:17.60
When he finally landed Skank and the landing signal officer talked to me as I swung around

1095
01:09:17.60 --> 01:09:18.60
the ship again.

1096
01:09:18.60 --> 01:09:22.12
Stay low, follow the ship's wake.

1097
01:09:22.12 --> 01:09:24.88
I got down close to the water as I dared 40 feet.

1098
01:09:24.88 --> 01:09:28.60
Maybe the flight deck is set to at 65 feet off the swells.

1099
01:09:28.60 --> 01:09:30.80
A red light began flashing in my cockpit.

1100
01:09:30.80 --> 01:09:32.52
Low fuel.

1101
01:09:32.52 --> 01:09:33.52
This was it.

1102
01:09:33.52 --> 01:09:39.28
Either land or eject into the frigid seas and see how good our survival suits really were.

1103
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:42.72
Our life expectancy in the freezing water was five minutes.

1104
01:09:42.72 --> 01:09:43.72
No thanks.

1105
01:09:43.72 --> 01:09:47.52
In the darkness I found the carriers white-wake and followed it until I spotted the drop lights

1106
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:49.24
on the ship's stern ahead.

1107
01:09:49.24 --> 01:09:51.44
They were above me.

1108
01:09:51.44 --> 01:09:53.20
The landing signal officer told me to climb.

1109
01:09:53.20 --> 01:09:56.48
I pulled the nose up as the fanom's nose top the ramp.

1110
01:09:56.48 --> 01:09:59.56
I pushed the stick forward and an instant later pulled back up.

1111
01:09:59.56 --> 01:10:00.56
This was an old trick.

1112
01:10:00.56 --> 01:10:03.68
A World War II ace named Zika Kormier taught me.

1113
01:10:03.68 --> 01:10:07.56
It saved my mind and Dennis' life that night.

1114
01:10:07.56 --> 01:10:08.80
The fanom touched the deck.

1115
01:10:08.80 --> 01:10:12.04
The tail hook caught an arresting wire and we jerk to his stop.

1116
01:10:12.04 --> 01:10:17.40
As we waited for the deck crew to clear us my knees trembled and my feet shook on the

1117
01:10:17.40 --> 01:10:18.56
brake pedals.

1118
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:22.56
Of all the flying I'd done to this date this was the most demanding.

1119
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:27.32
Why somebody in Washington wanted us in the air that night is anyone's guess.

1120
01:10:27.32 --> 01:10:30.96
I can't think of what we accomplished in our 90-minute story.

1121
01:10:30.96 --> 01:10:36.56
Other then perhaps impress the North Korean radar operators who undoubtedly tracked our

1122
01:10:36.56 --> 01:10:38.88
progress through the weather.

1123
01:10:38.88 --> 01:10:41.64
We had wrist our lives for nothing.

1124
01:10:41.64 --> 01:10:48.64
Who were these politicians to play games with our lives?

1125
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:57.24
That sort of mandated operation happens far too frequently.

1126
01:10:57.24 --> 01:11:02.12
Even today they never been there.

1127
01:11:02.12 --> 01:11:04.40
They couldn't do it.

1128
01:11:04.40 --> 01:11:07.56
They've got the power.

1129
01:11:07.56 --> 01:11:08.56
That's a problem.

1130
01:11:08.56 --> 01:11:18.40
I have emotionally I've tried to think about a book of how to, how to the military historically

1131
01:11:18.40 --> 01:11:24.64
has always been subservient to the politicians in Washington.

1132
01:11:24.64 --> 01:11:33.48
If you look at the entire Vietnam situation, LBJ and Mac Tamara and the way they dictated

1133
01:11:33.48 --> 01:11:35.88
what we did every day.

1134
01:11:35.88 --> 01:11:44.68
I would never, ever, ever convinced me that what they were doing was the end result was

1135
01:11:44.68 --> 01:11:45.68
to win.

1136
01:11:45.68 --> 01:11:48.40
We went along the win.

1137
01:11:48.40 --> 01:11:52.36
I kind of breeze through the section in the opening of this when you're talking about

1138
01:11:52.36 --> 01:11:57.40
the fact that you guys are hitting targets that you're getting from the White House, from

1139
01:11:57.40 --> 01:11:58.72
the Pentagon.

1140
01:11:58.72 --> 01:12:02.000
That's who's doing your target selection.

1141
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Totally crazy.

1142
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.36
And they're coming from Magnum or his office.

1143
01:12:07.36 --> 01:12:12.32
We'd find out, they'd come in on a wire about midnight.

1144
01:12:12.32 --> 01:12:17.40
The ships would put out an airplane for the next day.

1145
01:12:17.40 --> 01:12:21.88
But the targets were being dictated from Washington.

1146
01:12:21.88 --> 01:12:30.24
And even since then, they come out that there's been testimony that that same target

1147
01:12:30.24 --> 01:12:34.72
list was sent to the Swiss embassy.

1148
01:12:34.72 --> 01:12:40.28
And the Swiss embassy had related to the North Vietnamese.

1149
01:12:40.28 --> 01:12:50.24
The logic in DC was if they know where we're coming, we won't kill so much collateral

1150
01:12:50.24 --> 01:12:51.24
damage.

1151
01:12:51.24 --> 01:13:00.76
And this is a pretty good case that that actually happened.

1152
01:13:00.76 --> 01:13:04.28
Imagine risking your life every day.

1153
01:13:04.28 --> 01:13:07.44
By the way, the North Vietnamese, they don't care about civilians getting killed.

1154
01:13:07.44 --> 01:13:08.44
They care about their mix.

1155
01:13:08.44 --> 01:13:10.16
Well, that's what they care about.

1156
01:13:10.16 --> 01:13:11.16
That's right.

1157
01:13:11.16 --> 01:13:15.20
And they actually want civilians to get killed because then they can use that as propaganda

1158
01:13:15.20 --> 01:13:16.20
against America.

1159
01:13:16.20 --> 01:13:21.20
We could never, Chaco, we could never understand how they're going to be.

1160
01:13:21.20 --> 01:13:29.08
The next day we'd go into the targets and they'd have moved the mobile same sites and

1161
01:13:29.08 --> 01:13:32.08
AAA that were all on wheels.

1162
01:13:32.08 --> 01:13:35.76
And they moved them into the targets that we were going to hit.

1163
01:13:35.76 --> 01:13:40.68
And that's why I think you'll hear from most of the veterans of flu out there.

1164
01:13:40.68 --> 01:13:45.68
It's probably that tough as air defenses, some in there ever gone against.

1165
01:13:45.68 --> 01:13:47.32
You know, you go into it a little bit here.

1166
01:13:47.32 --> 01:13:48.32
I got to read this part.

1167
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:52.72
It says, conceived in Washington by Secretary Defense Robert McNamara and approved by President

1168
01:13:52.72 --> 01:13:56.96
Johnson, our bombing campaign was meant not to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war.

1169
01:13:56.96 --> 01:14:01.28
It wasn't designed to demolish their air defense network so we could operate over North

1170
01:14:01.28 --> 01:14:03.28
Vietnam, nom with impunity.

1171
01:14:03.28 --> 01:14:06.08
It had nothing to do with tangible results or victory.

1172
01:14:06.08 --> 01:14:10.48
It had everything to do with sending gradual messages to Hanoi.

1173
01:14:10.48 --> 01:14:14.68
Where I'd expected to be the tip of the spear, we were instead the thumb and forefinger

1174
01:14:14.68 --> 01:14:19.28
of Lyndon Johnson's gradual escalation of pressure on the North Vietnamese.

1175
01:14:19.28 --> 01:14:23.08
We weren't allowed to apply pressure anywhere that it might hurt.

1176
01:14:23.08 --> 01:14:28.32
We were only allowed just to pinch their metaphorical shoulder as a warning that if they

1177
01:14:28.32 --> 01:14:32.000
didn't behave, we would pinch harder.

1178
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.72
What rolling thunder campaign was, the rolling thunder campaign was LBJ's personal

1179
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:37.72
Billy Club.

1180
01:14:37.72 --> 01:14:41.24
He would send us to smack the North Vietnamese for sending supplies and troops to the

1181
01:14:41.24 --> 01:14:46.92
insurgents, then order unilateral stand-downs known as bombing pauses to give the North

1182
01:14:46.92 --> 01:14:51.96
Vietnamese time to internalize the punishment and heed its lesson.

1183
01:14:51.96 --> 01:14:54.16
But the pauses just gave them time to rearm.

1184
01:14:54.16 --> 01:14:58.36
The American response seemed only to emboldened Hanoi and convinced its leadership that

1185
01:14:58.36 --> 01:15:04.000
we were more worried about the widening war and possibly fighting China or the Soviet Union

1186
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.88
than we were about defeating them.

1187
01:15:05.88 --> 01:15:10.68
They used the bombing pauses to resupply and prepare for the next onslaught.

1188
01:15:10.68 --> 01:15:13.28
A lot of Americans died as a result.

1189
01:15:13.28 --> 01:15:15.80
Some were friends of mine.

1190
01:15:15.80 --> 01:15:21.12
On Yankee Station, the Enterprise Air Wing learned that this, what this meant to individual

1191
01:15:21.12 --> 01:15:26.72
air crews, Johnson McNamara, micro-managed the losing air war from Washington DC, going so

1192
01:15:26.72 --> 01:15:30.20
far as to pick our targets.

1193
01:15:30.20 --> 01:15:34.20
They were perhaps 150 worthwhile things to bomb a North Vietnam.

1194
01:15:34.20 --> 01:15:38.96
Air fields, military bases, supply facilities, power plants, bridges, rail centers, oil, lubricant

1195
01:15:38.96 --> 01:15:43.52
facilities, a few steel mills, and of course, high-fong's port facilities.

1196
01:15:43.52 --> 01:15:45.20
Am I saying that right?

1197
01:15:45.20 --> 01:15:46.20
High-fong?

1198
01:15:46.20 --> 01:15:49.96
As both China and Russia wanted to be Hanoi's primary alley, they each tried to

1199
01:15:49.96 --> 01:15:52.04
one up each other with military support.

1200
01:15:52.04 --> 01:15:57.80
Large convoys of weapons and warm material flowed across the Chinese border to Vietnam.

1201
01:15:57.80 --> 01:16:02.76
While the Russians have evolved tanks and surfaced to air missiles, systems via ships

1202
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:08.92
into the high-fong harbor, the enemy, thus had sanctuary to bring in what ever was

1203
01:16:08.92 --> 01:16:12.000
needed for years.

1204
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.60
Afraid of escalating the war, the Johnson administration refused to sanction attacks on

1205
01:16:16.60 --> 01:16:19.000
high-fong harbor or the shipping there.

1206
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.36
As we started to fly missions up North, up North, we would pass those cargo ships as they

1207
01:16:23.36 --> 01:16:26.32
waited their turn to off-load at the docks.

1208
01:16:26.32 --> 01:16:32.08
We could see their decks crammed with weatherized migs and surfaced to air missiles that

1209
01:16:32.08 --> 01:16:37.36
would be shortly used against us, but we couldn't hit them.

1210
01:16:37.36 --> 01:16:39.28
We couldn't mind the harbor either.

1211
01:16:39.28 --> 01:16:40.28
What a tragedy.

1212
01:16:40.28 --> 01:16:46.000
The simple execution of an off-the-shelf aerial mining plan long before perfected during World

1213
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.32
War II and carried out in three days could have shut down that big port.

1214
01:16:50.32 --> 01:16:56.68
The only one of its kind in North Vietnam, but the word from the White House was no.

1215
01:16:56.68 --> 01:17:00.32
Those big surface-to-air missiles as large as telephone poles would spear up into the sky

1216
01:17:00.32 --> 01:17:03.52
after our airport, homing on their radar signatures.

1217
01:17:03.52 --> 01:17:05.36
They took a heavy toll.

1218
01:17:05.36 --> 01:17:11.96
We could sell them bomb the missile sites for fear we might kill their Russian advisors.

1219
01:17:11.96 --> 01:17:15.32
When the North Vietnamese began flying Russian and Chinese-built make fighters, the Navy

1220
01:17:15.32 --> 01:17:22.48
and Air Force asked Washington for permission to bomb their airfields, the request was denied.

1221
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:28.12
Categories of targets that could not be struck under any circumstances included dams, hydroelectric

1222
01:17:28.12 --> 01:17:31.04
plants, fishing boats, sand pans, and houseboats.

1223
01:17:31.04 --> 01:17:33.92
They also included significantly populated areas.

1224
01:17:33.92 --> 01:17:38.56
After seeing the military value of these restrictions and North Vietnamese, placed most of

1225
01:17:38.56 --> 01:17:44.36
their Sam support facilities and other valuable cargo near Hanoi and high-fong places where

1226
01:17:44.36 --> 01:17:47.40
we were forbidden to strike.

1227
01:17:47.40 --> 01:17:51.72
The airfields around Hanoi became sanctuaries for mix.

1228
01:17:51.72 --> 01:17:58.20
The commander in chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp, who had overall

1229
01:17:58.20 --> 01:18:03.56
responsibility for the air war, urged the joint chiefs to have to lift the crippling restrictions.

1230
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:08.40
Meanwhile, the enemy fighter pilots could sit on their runways in their planes without fear

1231
01:18:08.40 --> 01:18:14.04
of attack, waiting to scramble when our bombers showed up.

1232
01:18:14.04 --> 01:18:17.44
Eventually Johnson and McNamara cave to the pressure and allowed strikes on the airfields

1233
01:18:17.44 --> 01:18:22.80
yet they might be mismatched even this, picking specific airfields and leaving others out of

1234
01:18:22.80 --> 01:18:23.80
bounds.

1235
01:18:23.80 --> 01:18:31.80
It was always necessary to virtually beg target authorization out of Washington, bit by peace

1236
01:18:31.80 --> 01:18:37.16
Admiral Sharp wrote, instead of letting the navy launch a blitz that might break the

1237
01:18:37.16 --> 01:18:42.48
bath back of the North Vietnamese air force, we hate a few air bases at a time while leaving

1238
01:18:42.48 --> 01:18:52.64
the rest unscathed.

1239
01:18:52.64 --> 01:18:53.84
I got to read this too.

1240
01:18:53.84 --> 01:18:55.40
It was a setup for failure, you say.

1241
01:18:55.40 --> 01:18:56.76
And it got a lot worse.

1242
01:18:56.76 --> 01:19:00.24
Those rules of engagement negated the way we had trained to fight in the air.

1243
01:19:00.24 --> 01:19:05.000
The value of RF4 phantoms was their ability to destroy airplanes and enemy planes from

1244
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.68
beyond visual range.

1245
01:19:06.68 --> 01:19:11.28
The aim seven sparrow was the ultimate expression of that new way of fighting.

1246
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:15.68
Track and lock with the radar system loose the missile from 10 miles out and say goodbye

1247
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:16.68
to the make.

1248
01:19:16.68 --> 01:19:18.92
This is how the navy trained us to fight.

1249
01:19:18.92 --> 01:19:23.76
We abandoned dogfight training because of the navy's faith in missile technology.

1250
01:19:23.76 --> 01:19:27.28
Most of our air crews didn't know most of our air crews didn't know how to fight any

1251
01:19:27.28 --> 01:19:29.000
other way.

1252
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.76
We had our own rules of engagement kept us from using what we were talking.

1253
01:19:32.76 --> 01:19:39.16
The rules of engagement specifically prohibited firing from beyond visual range.

1254
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:43.60
To shoot a missile at an aircraft a fighter pilot needed to first visually confirm it was

1255
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:46.16
a mig and not a friendly plane.

1256
01:19:46.16 --> 01:19:50.40
The thought of an inadvertent or accidental shoot down of our brothers was of course intolerable.

1257
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:53.000
It did happen sadly in the heat of combat.

1258
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.84
Yet three years along the training squadron in California was still teaching long range

1259
01:19:57.84 --> 01:20:01.52
to intercept tactics to the exclusion of everything else.

1260
01:20:01.52 --> 01:20:06.24
Our training was not applicable to the air war in Vietnam.

1261
01:20:06.24 --> 01:20:09.60
This played directly into the kind of the fight that make pilots wanted.

1262
01:20:09.60 --> 01:20:13.16
The make 17 was a nimble fighter armed with cannons but no missiles.

1263
01:20:13.16 --> 01:20:17.92
It was an old school derived from the Soviet lessons learned in the Korean war with such

1264
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:23.08
a plane the North Vietnamese needed to get in close and track our planes with their gun sites.

1265
01:20:23.08 --> 01:20:28.000
They would sometimes wait to open fire until they were within 600 feet.

1266
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Here we were trained in knock planes down at 10 miles.

1267
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.16
The F4 carried only missiles.

1268
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:38.000
It did not have an internal gun because contractors in the Pentagon believe the age of the

1269
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.80
dark fight was over.

1270
01:20:39.80 --> 01:20:44.68
We brought our expensive high tech into this knife fight in a phone booth.

1271
01:20:44.68 --> 01:20:51.12
The result, the make pilots scored a lot more heavily than they should have.

1272
01:20:51.12 --> 01:20:58.16
The good read and again, I'm even when I'm reading chunks like that.

1273
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:03.84
I'm skipping over sections, you know, just to the history and you know, from a leadership

1274
01:21:03.84 --> 01:21:06.96
perspective, this is a nightmare.

1275
01:21:06.96 --> 01:21:11.40
It's a nightmare that there's no connection from the people that are making decisions

1276
01:21:11.40 --> 01:21:13.56
to the folks that are on the frontline fighting.

1277
01:21:13.56 --> 01:21:15.32
They're not listening to the feedback.

1278
01:21:15.32 --> 01:21:16.96
It's a disaster.

1279
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:23.96
Their motives or their motives are different.

1280
01:21:23.96 --> 01:21:26.96
You know, I really had thought about a book.

1281
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:28.96
I'm not good enough to write it.

1282
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:29.96
I don't think.

1283
01:21:29.96 --> 01:21:35.60
But you've got the industry building weapons.

1284
01:21:35.60 --> 01:21:39.96
Whatever they are, airplanes, park, and rules systems, everything.

1285
01:21:39.96 --> 01:21:42.20
The industry is building them.

1286
01:21:42.20 --> 01:21:44.96
What's their motive, profit?

1287
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:48.92
Then the American weapons, okay, I'll give them that.

1288
01:21:48.92 --> 01:21:55.40
But mainly profit motive, then you can keep coming down the politicians.

1289
01:21:55.40 --> 01:21:57.68
We know what their motives are like.

1290
01:21:57.68 --> 01:22:02.56
And you come down to the poor guy who's flying in the machine.

1291
01:22:02.56 --> 01:22:09.80
If it doesn't do the job that's required in the operational scenario you're involved in,

1292
01:22:09.80 --> 01:22:11.52
you can lose.

1293
01:22:11.52 --> 01:22:16.28
And losing is second best in tactics.

1294
01:22:16.28 --> 01:22:18.28
Yeah, losing is dying.

1295
01:22:18.28 --> 01:22:19.28
That's right.

1296
01:22:19.28 --> 01:22:20.28
Exactly.

1297
01:22:20.28 --> 01:22:27.12
You know, the other thing, and I go after Robert McNamara a lot, you say this.

1298
01:22:27.12 --> 01:22:29.28
Robert McNamara is a numbers guy.

1299
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:32.92
And this is the thing, there's secondary effects.

1300
01:22:32.92 --> 01:22:41.20
There's tertiary effects that happen when people are motivated by certain certain

1301
01:22:41.20 --> 01:22:42.20
metrics.

1302
01:22:42.20 --> 01:22:44.40
So here's what happens.

1303
01:22:44.40 --> 01:22:46.80
Robert McNamara was a numbers guy.

1304
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:50.60
Under him, the Pentagon measured success in the ground war by the body count.

1305
01:22:50.60 --> 01:22:52.000
Can you believe that?

1306
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.28
In the air, the air, the metric was the number of sorties flown over North Vietnam.

1307
01:22:58.28 --> 01:23:01.20
One sortie equals one plane flying one mission.

1308
01:23:01.20 --> 01:23:04.40
A ten plane raid resulted in ten sorties.

1309
01:23:04.40 --> 01:23:06.64
This became a delusional world.

1310
01:23:06.64 --> 01:23:09.52
A sortie counted in the total.

1311
01:23:09.52 --> 01:23:13.76
Even if our bombers were forced to dump their payloads short of the target, which often

1312
01:23:13.76 --> 01:23:19.88
happened when Meg's appeared, facing pressure to generate sorties, the carriers were worn

1313
01:23:19.88 --> 01:23:21.20
and ragged.

1314
01:23:21.20 --> 01:23:25.60
Aircraft handling crews worked 12 hours on 12 hours off, spotting and respawning the

1315
01:23:25.60 --> 01:23:30.52
decks, launching strikes, recovering aircraft, arming and refueling the birds, racing

1316
01:23:30.52 --> 01:23:34.08
to meet the sortie rate required of them.

1317
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:39.68
Such pilot flew twice a day with each mission taking several hours to brief and debrief.

1318
01:23:39.68 --> 01:23:45.52
We flew to the edge of fatigue and beyond aviators who were shot down and recovered were

1319
01:23:45.52 --> 01:23:50.48
back in action in a few short days.

1320
01:23:50.48 --> 01:23:54.88
While the tempo took a heavy toll, it also led to the needless tragedies, including

1321
01:23:54.88 --> 01:24:00.40
major fires aboard our carriers, the results of exhaustive crews making mistakes, scores

1322
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:04.48
of sailors and aviators died in those accidents and the fires on two carriers were serious

1323
01:24:04.48 --> 01:24:07.76
enough to risk the loss of the ship.

1324
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:12.56
We were losing good men needlessly in the push to maintain the sortie rate.

1325
01:24:12.56 --> 01:24:15.28
Why competition between services?

1326
01:24:15.28 --> 01:24:19.92
With the Air Force and Navy battling fiercely for appropriations, both were determined to

1327
01:24:19.92 --> 01:24:25.16
outdo the sorties the other flew.

1328
01:24:25.16 --> 01:24:31.88
To put in perspective for your audience, I want to tell you a story.

1329
01:24:31.88 --> 01:24:38.88
The skank that's in there in the story was up during the rescue of the Pueblo and

1330
01:24:38.88 --> 01:24:44.52
skank Rimsson was a squirting commander.

1331
01:24:44.52 --> 01:24:51.40
It's a front row guy never took a mission that he wouldn't lead and if they were tough,

1332
01:24:51.40 --> 01:24:53.32
he was always there.

1333
01:24:53.32 --> 01:25:03.08
That's why we were out together on that particular word back down in Vietnam during that same

1334
01:25:03.08 --> 01:25:05.08
cruise.

1335
01:25:05.08 --> 01:25:13.72
I wasn't with him this day, but this tells you the quality of the guy in the naval aviation.

1336
01:25:13.72 --> 01:25:20.20
He's in over the beach in North Vietnam and he's a low-alditude and a rifle shot goes

1337
01:25:20.20 --> 01:25:22.08
through the cockpit.

1338
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:24.80
He gets a flashy part of his legs.

1339
01:25:24.80 --> 01:25:33.12
Both legs went through, come out the other side, lost in the console on the left side.

1340
01:25:33.12 --> 01:25:35.64
He shot up in two legs.

1341
01:25:35.64 --> 01:25:43.80
He retits down, pulls the garter's up, the garter's hold for the ejection seat, their straps

1342
01:25:43.80 --> 01:25:46.28
that go around your calves.

1343
01:25:46.28 --> 01:25:54.76
He brings him up, he turns his legs above his wounds, flies 140 miles back to the enterprise

1344
01:25:54.76 --> 01:25:57.48
and lands aboard.

1345
01:25:57.48 --> 01:25:58.80
This is T.S.

1346
01:25:58.80 --> 01:26:03.40
Bremson, skank Rimsson, the squirting commander.

1347
01:26:03.40 --> 01:26:09.28
He lands aboard the medic skitty moth at cockpit taking down the dock sewing up.

1348
01:26:09.28 --> 01:26:16.96
Two weeks later, Jaco, he was back in combat flying with his squirting.

1349
01:26:16.96 --> 01:26:24.72
He refused to be met with him and there are plenty of mothers like him.

1350
01:26:24.72 --> 01:26:31.56
I know in your world, both of you, that you come out of there upon the guys like that,

1351
01:26:31.56 --> 01:26:41.32
a great Americans, but they are poorly officiated up above them in many instances.

1352
01:26:41.32 --> 01:26:47.28
When you get into, when you hit the part about how top-gone was put together, we were

1353
01:26:47.28 --> 01:26:49.80
exposed to guys like this.

1354
01:26:49.80 --> 01:26:55.000
We knew what the answers needed to be, some moment to it, it really knew.

1355
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:06.20
That's when I came from Genova, Lecha, Alex Varaeshu, Texanel, Skank Rimsson, Mentoring.

1356
01:27:06.20 --> 01:27:13.24
We knew what the gun dancers were and they sure weren't sitting in the earring in a pentagon

1357
01:27:13.24 --> 01:27:16.000
or in Congress.

1358
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.56
In this section here, you kind of detail the chapter title is Yankee Station Education.

1359
01:27:24.56 --> 01:27:30.48
And it gives a good overview and again, I'm jumping ahead of some of the information

1360
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:33.68
you cover, but you say, day after day, we flew missions from Yankee Station to Hammer

1361
01:27:33.68 --> 01:27:35.44
targets of questionable value.

1362
01:27:35.44 --> 01:27:38.84
We bomb truck convoyes when we could find them on search and destroy mission.

1363
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:40.56
They move mostly at night and total darkness.

1364
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:44.40
We bomb supply, depose, and occasionally, when after power plants, as well as military

1365
01:27:44.40 --> 01:27:48.08
barracks, long flattened by the squadron to have deployed before us.

1366
01:27:48.08 --> 01:27:49.64
We went after bridges and sam sites.

1367
01:27:49.64 --> 01:27:53.84
Very occasionally, we received permission from Washington to hit mega airfields around

1368
01:27:53.84 --> 01:27:54.84
Hanoi.

1369
01:27:54.84 --> 01:27:58.32
The F4 was designed from the ground up to be a mock-plus interceptor.

1370
01:27:58.32 --> 01:28:01.76
It was supposed to be the bane of all Soviet built strategic bombers.

1371
01:28:01.76 --> 01:28:07.20
Over Vietnam, the phantom became perhaps the most versatile multi-role aircraft America has ever

1372
01:28:07.20 --> 01:28:08.68
produced.

1373
01:28:08.68 --> 01:28:14.20
Still with its interceptor heart, it functioned as an escort fighter, utility strike bomber

1374
01:28:14.20 --> 01:28:20.64
and south of the D. Militarizone, a close air-support aircraft.

1375
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:24.36
We were doing it all, learning on the job how to best carry out our missions.

1376
01:28:24.36 --> 01:28:26.08
They were never the same.

1377
01:28:26.08 --> 01:28:31.84
But the two days, over the north, usually one at night, left us worn out.

1378
01:28:31.84 --> 01:28:34.92
The lack of quality sleep could also put our nerves on edge at time.

1379
01:28:34.92 --> 01:28:36.40
We grew easily frustrated.

1380
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:39.24
Some people started to withdraw into the pressure.

1381
01:28:39.24 --> 01:28:41.76
The exhaustion, the grief over losing so many friends.

1382
01:28:41.76 --> 01:28:43.36
This didn't happen in my squadron.

1383
01:28:43.36 --> 01:28:48.08
Skank and the other senior pilots set the example by flying almost all the difficult missions

1384
01:28:48.08 --> 01:28:52.48
with the junior crews while never griping about the targets or the rules of engagement.

1385
01:28:52.48 --> 01:28:56.04
They were great pilots as well as tremendous inspirations to all of us.

1386
01:28:56.04 --> 01:29:01.92
Skank kept us focused and working as a team, taking care of each of us as we flew daily

1387
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:02.92
into harm's way.

1388
01:29:02.92 --> 01:29:06.32
In our earwing, all the squadrons were led by example.

1389
01:29:06.32 --> 01:29:09.60
It wasn't always that way as some other outfits experienced.

1390
01:29:09.60 --> 01:29:16.000
We were losing guys to Sam's, Flaq, and even Migs, whose pilots well directed by radar,

1391
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.68
would launch slashing attacks into our formations.

1392
01:29:19.68 --> 01:29:23.32
At the end of January, the North Vietnamese Army launched a major attack against a series

1393
01:29:23.32 --> 01:29:29.92
of special forces outposts and the marine fire base at K-Song, which sat up on top of a flat

1394
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:32.84
top tail with all sides exposed.

1395
01:29:32.84 --> 01:29:39.40
We launched late that afternoon and flew 200 miles to our marshalling station above K-Song.

1396
01:29:39.40 --> 01:29:44.32
With the battle filling the surrounding valleys with gray box smoke, we had only glimpses

1397
01:29:44.32 --> 01:29:45.88
of what was happening below.

1398
01:29:45.88 --> 01:29:48.28
The airfield was a scene of carnage.

1399
01:29:48.28 --> 01:29:53.16
Burnt out aircraft laid pushed to a side of the runway, victims of mortar broads.

1400
01:29:53.16 --> 01:29:58.44
The base itself looked like a lunar landscape, with thousands of shell creators overlapping

1401
01:29:58.44 --> 01:30:00.56
in the reddish, soft soil.

1402
01:30:00.56 --> 01:30:05.44
I checked in with the marine forward air controller, whose job it was to guide us on the target.

1403
01:30:05.44 --> 01:30:09.16
He was down there right amongst those young American kids and during the artillery

1404
01:30:09.16 --> 01:30:11.88
broads is a night assault alongside them.

1405
01:30:11.88 --> 01:30:15.76
With his radios and expertise, he was their fist of God.

1406
01:30:15.76 --> 01:30:21.32
He was probably a marine aviator as well, so he spoke our language and understood our perspective.

1407
01:30:21.32 --> 01:30:25.36
The forward air controller heard my check in radio call and responded immediately.

1408
01:30:25.36 --> 01:30:28.000
The situation sounded dire from his description.

1409
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.44
North Vietnamese troops were massing just beyond the wire for another night assault, and

1410
01:30:32.44 --> 01:30:36.40
he wanted me to hit thing with everything under my wings before darkness gave them the

1411
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:38.76
opportunity to attack again.

1412
01:30:38.76 --> 01:30:43.80
The late day offered a rare cloudless sky, the blue stretching above me contrasted with the ugly

1413
01:30:43.80 --> 01:30:47.96
coils of smoke and flame filling the valley under my phantoms nose.

1414
01:30:47.96 --> 01:30:51.48
After receiving my instructions, I started down to begin my run.

1415
01:30:51.48 --> 01:30:55.64
Keep your speed up, 500 knots, 400 feet, they'll be shooting at you.

1416
01:30:55.64 --> 01:30:57.48
Called the forward air controller.

1417
01:30:57.48 --> 01:30:59.56
Drop all your snakes on my signal.

1418
01:30:59.56 --> 01:31:04.56
Remember, there are marines on the wire, just off your left wing.

1419
01:31:04.56 --> 01:31:07.44
I leveled off at 400 feet, going 500 knots.

1420
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:11.04
The phantom spread through the clouds of smoke, from the hills to a right small arms

1421
01:31:11.04 --> 01:31:16.000
fire erupted in my back cedar, Dennis Duffy and I could see the muzzle flashes.

1422
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Moments later, red orange tracers lace the sky ahead of us and level with us.

1423
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.92
With my high speed, I wasn't so concerned with taking hints from the North Vietnamese troops

1424
01:31:25.92 --> 01:31:30.84
on the right of us whose tracers were horizontal, but I was terrified of blowing the run

1425
01:31:30.84 --> 01:31:36.48
and dropping my snakes on the marines near the wire by accident.

1426
01:31:36.48 --> 01:31:42.000
Or an inexperienced navy pilot did just that by accident and wounded some of our men.

1427
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.60
The idea of killing Americans with a misplaced bomb, well, I knew I would never get over

1428
01:31:46.60 --> 01:31:47.60
that if it happened.

1429
01:31:47.60 --> 01:31:51.44
I listened carefully to every word that forward air controller said.

1430
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:56.16
If I wasn't exactly level, the bombs might fall right or left of the target area depending

1431
01:31:56.16 --> 01:31:58.56
on where my wings were to the horizon.

1432
01:31:58.56 --> 01:32:02.72
Holding steady while every bad guy with an AK-47 seemed to be shooting at me was no easy

1433
01:32:02.72 --> 01:32:03.72
feet.

1434
01:32:03.72 --> 01:32:06.52
Back it was the toughest flying I'd ever done.

1435
01:32:06.52 --> 01:32:11.44
I checked my heading, wings level, a second later the forward air controller called

1436
01:32:11.44 --> 01:32:13.16
drop, drop, drop.

1437
01:32:13.16 --> 01:32:19.24
I pickled the Marquee de Tues, the F4 lurched upward as 6,000 pounds of bombs came off our hard

1438
01:32:19.24 --> 01:32:21.96
points and began falling toward the ground.

1439
01:32:21.96 --> 01:32:25.64
Simultaneously I pushed the throttle further and lit the burner.

1440
01:32:25.64 --> 01:32:32.12
The fanom's twin J79 engines responded and we pulled with 5G's back to where we belonged

1441
01:32:32.12 --> 01:32:33.80
far above the fray.

1442
01:32:33.80 --> 01:32:39.40
Duff my back's seat or said, let's all ask Kim Osabe as we climbed my throat constricted,

1443
01:32:39.40 --> 01:32:43.56
heart filled with dread while we waited to hear from the forward air controller.

1444
01:32:43.56 --> 01:32:48.48
Toughest part of the mission is waiting for the results from the big, grunt FAC.

1445
01:32:48.48 --> 01:32:51.44
Oh shit, did I just kill a bunch of Marines?

1446
01:32:51.44 --> 01:32:53.20
No word from the air controller.

1447
01:32:53.20 --> 01:32:57.16
The ultimate or need or kneel spun as we seared through 3000 feet.

1448
01:32:57.16 --> 01:32:58.52
The seconds ticked off.

1449
01:32:58.52 --> 01:33:03.32
No word behind me Dennis was twisted in his ejection seat trying to see where our bombs

1450
01:33:03.32 --> 01:33:04.32
landed.

1451
01:33:04.32 --> 01:33:06.92
Oh shit, the radio filled with static.

1452
01:33:06.92 --> 01:33:13.84
Then the forward air controller's voice shouted, great run, great run, right on target.

1453
01:33:13.84 --> 01:33:19.16
The Marines held and as a joint army navy, as a joint army marine and south Vietnamese

1454
01:33:19.16 --> 01:33:24.60
rescue force battled up its way, its way up highway 9 to break the siege.

1455
01:33:24.60 --> 01:33:29.64
The Enterprise Air Wing returned to its regularly scheduled programming over North Vietnam.

1456
01:33:29.64 --> 01:33:31.64
We flew that day and night.

1457
01:33:31.64 --> 01:33:33.84
We flew day and night in any kind of weather.

1458
01:33:33.84 --> 01:33:38.36
We flew alpha strikes which were large on wheeled the raids of 30 or more planes.

1459
01:33:38.36 --> 01:33:43.12
We have force provided escort against the mid threat or went to suppress air defenses while

1460
01:33:43.12 --> 01:33:46.80
a 4 skyhawk attack planes struck targets.

1461
01:33:46.80 --> 01:33:53.000
We flew 2 and 4 plane armed recumissions searching for anything worthwhile, Washington allowed

1462
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
us to bomb.

1463
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.76
There's not a person that knows anything about the military that hasn't heard about

1464
01:34:00.76 --> 01:34:03.92
the case on the siege at case on.

1465
01:34:03.92 --> 01:34:09.92
Wow, that's a crazy story from your perspective hearing it from your end.

1466
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:13.92
Well, it was so desperate.

1467
01:34:13.92 --> 01:34:17.24
The siege was so bad by that time.

1468
01:34:17.24 --> 01:34:19.56
They actually brought us in.

1469
01:34:19.56 --> 01:34:25.08
The Marines at two lines and they were flying closer or sub-ort two.

1470
01:34:25.08 --> 01:34:28.72
We didn't do that much of it navy guys.

1471
01:34:28.72 --> 01:34:32.52
But it was, I had seen pictures of it.

1472
01:34:32.52 --> 01:34:36.64
Recky pictures and so forth, reconnaissance.

1473
01:34:36.64 --> 01:34:44.56
But to see it up close and then hear some guys down there on the wire with the guys who

1474
01:34:44.56 --> 01:34:53.80
it endured a night in a major night at Vance by the North Vietnamese couple days before.

1475
01:34:53.80 --> 01:34:56.88
I mean, this is serious business.

1476
01:34:56.88 --> 01:35:01.60
Dave, you got to experience that.

1477
01:35:01.60 --> 01:35:07.80
How good does it feel when you're on the ground and you're talking to somebody and you know

1478
01:35:07.80 --> 01:35:11.60
you know what to say, you speak their language and then when you're in the air and you hear

1479
01:35:11.60 --> 01:35:14.52
that person's voice and you're all right, I got you.

1480
01:35:14.52 --> 01:35:22.44
I mean, listen to this is just, I mean, I'm kind of choked up just hearing you tell the story.

1481
01:35:22.44 --> 01:35:28.68
I was, I was so lucky in my career to spend so much great time flying but that I got

1482
01:35:28.68 --> 01:35:36.04
to live with Jocco's guys for about six months to run in the other side and I remember

1483
01:35:36.04 --> 01:35:40.20
being told that we would, that type one cast was dead.

1484
01:35:40.20 --> 01:35:43.04
I remember being told you'll never do it.

1485
01:35:43.04 --> 01:35:46.92
And so even some of the same institutional things you dealt with and to be down there talking

1486
01:35:46.92 --> 01:35:53.52
on my old squadron mates, doing type one gun runs in situations that I never thought I'd

1487
01:35:53.52 --> 01:35:58.12
be and but how good it felt to do something to be honest, we didn't really want to be

1488
01:35:58.12 --> 01:36:02.000
doing but to be down there and have guys that I knew from my old squadron is coming in

1489
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.40
doing gun runs and when those missions were over to go back and think man, like you said,

1490
01:36:07.40 --> 01:36:13.72
I mean, the serious business, the fact that the Marine Corps let me do that, there was a lot

1491
01:36:13.72 --> 01:36:18.64
of me that didn't really want to but that was the most powerful thing ever did in my 23-year

1492
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:25.08
career was use aircraft as fact to keep soldiers Marines and seals alive which to this

1493
01:36:25.08 --> 01:36:26.08
day.

1494
01:36:26.08 --> 01:36:30.000
How long were you on the ground or I didn't, I was a fact for one year I did seven months

1495
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.76
in Ramadi about six of it was what Jocco's team.

1496
01:36:33.76 --> 01:36:39.96
Hey, listen, yeah, don't take for one second that I want you to think that what that story

1497
01:36:39.96 --> 01:36:45.92
just told was my life, please don't and don't think that anything we did was remotely

1498
01:36:45.92 --> 01:36:50.68
comparable to you, you know, what the guys on case on and what the guys in Vietnam, you know,

1499
01:36:50.68 --> 01:36:53.84
we, we, you know, just not comparable.

1500
01:36:53.84 --> 01:36:54.84
It's just not comparable.

1501
01:36:54.84 --> 01:36:59.16
It's not a day even I and the rest of the guys in echelon front spend a lot of time talking

1502
01:36:59.16 --> 01:37:06.36
about the fact that our combat experience is it's a real stretch to use the word combat

1503
01:37:06.36 --> 01:37:10.92
experience when you compare it to a lot of the guys I've had on this podcast and a lot

1504
01:37:10.92 --> 01:37:16.52
of, you know, and obviously hundreds of thousands of of service men and women that have

1505
01:37:16.52 --> 01:37:23.80
done things infinitely, harder and more dangerous and with what much more sacrifice than

1506
01:37:23.80 --> 01:37:31.72
anything that we did and that's why we just try and, you know, capture some of the lessons.

1507
01:37:31.72 --> 01:37:41.72
I understand, but I also believe the most humble, most humble whether you're flying, whether

1508
01:37:41.72 --> 01:37:48.44
you're a seal or a grunt and a core that most humble are usually the best warriors.

1509
01:37:48.44 --> 01:37:55.000
I'm really find that in naval aviation, you know, rempton never would ever.

1510
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.88
You never even in the bar at night you'd never, you rempton tell that story upon himself.

1511
01:38:01.88 --> 01:38:05.24
They're humble guys, but they're great Americans.

1512
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:10.76
Indeed, and that's the same way, you know, you get down, you listen and I look at a lot of

1513
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:20.76
your podcasts, a single event in your life, your jacco or your David, a single event can get you killed.

1514
01:38:21.96 --> 01:38:28.28
Every event that you were involved in in your time and the service is important.

1515
01:38:29.48 --> 01:38:35.48
You made it through that single event and you go on to the next one and that's why,

1516
01:38:35.48 --> 01:38:41.72
well, I would get into it, but that's how the brotherhood, you know, why we top gun guys all

1517
01:38:41.72 --> 01:38:48.52
call each other bro. There were original nine bros, we're coming to that.

1518
01:38:50.20 --> 01:39:00.68
But rather that grew 600 bros. He's one of them and that's because they deal in each other's life

1519
01:39:00.68 --> 01:39:09.000
day after day after year after year, if they're good. Yeah, now you've heard my lecture.

1520
01:39:11.24 --> 01:39:17.08
Well, that was, you know, and I just kind of rattled off all the different types of missions that you

1521
01:39:17.08 --> 01:39:22.68
guys were doing and I'm going to fast forward a little bit here. It says the missions continued

1522
01:39:23.56 --> 01:39:29.64
as did the losses. There were nights, I got back to my bunk struggling with despair,

1523
01:39:29.64 --> 01:39:34.68
seeing friends die as never an easy thing. At times you think you grow hard to it.

1524
01:39:34.68 --> 01:39:40.20
Other times their deaths open wounds that the heart simply cannot heal. On those nights,

1525
01:39:40.20 --> 01:39:45.80
I would crawl under the covers and lay there, unable to sleep despite my exhaustion, mind racing.

1526
01:39:46.92 --> 01:39:51.000
Could we have done anything different? Could you have gotten out and we just didn't see the

1527
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.84
shoot? Fortunately none of them were from my squadron. I tried not to think about their families

1528
01:39:56.84 --> 01:40:01.88
back home, but the faces of wives and kids would sometimes allude those efforts and they would

1529
01:40:01.88 --> 01:40:07.88
come back to me in a rush. I found through my Navy career that some men revel in the challenge

1530
01:40:07.88 --> 01:40:14.36
and rush of combat. That pace of off the Vietnam, it was their hunting ground. Me, I never got to that

1531
01:40:14.36 --> 01:40:19.72
point. Combat was a responsibility, even a sacred duty. I took it very seriously, of course, but I

1532
01:40:19.72 --> 01:40:25.72
never liked it. Those men I would never see again. Those families I would see too soon again.

1533
01:40:25.72 --> 01:40:31.72
They were the cost of all that adrenaline rush. Others craved. That was a burden I couldn't

1534
01:40:31.72 --> 01:40:38.28
carry and love at the same time. The enemy always had a say. And that was the wild card in combat.

1535
01:40:38.28 --> 01:40:42.28
You could do everything right. Your division could do everything right. Your chain of command could

1536
01:40:42.28 --> 01:40:48.12
make every decision and lead from the front like Skank did. Yet we faced cunning, devoted, and

1537
01:40:48.12 --> 01:40:54.28
frankly courageous enemy who found ways to surprise us with new tricks. On those sleepless nights,

1538
01:40:54.28 --> 01:41:00.68
my brain refusing to shut off. I would think of those empty wardrobe chairs. We lost some

1539
01:41:00.68 --> 01:41:05.80
excellent pilots. All the talent in the world was not enough when fate called your number.

1540
01:41:11.88 --> 01:41:17.000
You close this section out saying, in those sleepless nights, which most of us out on Yaki

1541
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:23.72
station had, we did our best not to think of home. You could make you cautious hesitant in the

1542
01:41:23.72 --> 01:41:29.24
air, get you killed. If you were wrought wise, you never looked past the next dawn.

1543
01:41:30.12 --> 01:41:36.04
Some combat vets would tell the new guys, assume you're never coming back, truly believe it,

1544
01:41:36.84 --> 01:41:41.64
and you will make it home. It was a psychological paradox of battle.

1545
01:41:41.64 --> 01:41:57.08
Yeah, there's a weird challenge. For a grunt, you're there. You're sleeping in the dirt,

1546
01:41:57.08 --> 01:42:03.40
you're in danger. You get a use to it, you get numb to it, it's the reality.

1547
01:42:03.40 --> 01:42:11.56
For you guys to be back safe on an aircraft carrier and then load into your aircraft and launch,

1548
01:42:11.56 --> 01:42:16.68
that's a different cycle. And frankly, thinking about the guys that you lose,

1549
01:42:18.12 --> 01:42:25.64
you have less time to do that on the ground. You're actively engaged. Even when we come back

1550
01:42:25.64 --> 01:42:31.24
to base, we're planning for the next mission, and you know you're going out. But for you guys,

1551
01:42:31.24 --> 01:42:36.52
like, you know, even if you do two missions, even if it takes you 12 hours, you got 12

1552
01:42:36.52 --> 01:42:41.56
more hours in that day, you got to deal with. And that's a different, it's a different psychological

1553
01:42:41.56 --> 01:42:47.40
challenge, I think. And the way you described it, it sounded like a different psychological challenge.

1554
01:42:47.40 --> 01:42:55.16
And I will say, for me, the hardest part of doing a mission is waiting to go.

1555
01:42:55.88 --> 01:42:59.64
That's the only time where I'd be like, all right, what, you know, that's one of my mind would

1556
01:42:59.64 --> 01:43:04.20
start to race of did I think of everything? What go wrong? That's once you're on the mission,

1557
01:43:05.56 --> 01:43:11.16
you're in the zone, you know, you're, I'm not, I'm not thinking about anything but getting the job done.

1558
01:43:11.16 --> 01:43:16.52
But the hours before, four hours before, and you guys were in the perpetual cycle of

1559
01:43:17.40 --> 01:43:20.52
waiting to go and not knowing if it was going to be your time or not.

1560
01:43:20.52 --> 01:43:32.28
Well, that's the profession and evaluation. Nightcare landings always are exciting.

1561
01:43:35.24 --> 01:43:41.80
And you had an opportunity to get a big, but it didn't work out, what happened with that one?

1562
01:43:41.80 --> 01:43:52.52
Um, Remson and I and two other guys were vectored in hot ready to shoot and a follow my leader

1563
01:43:53.32 --> 01:43:57.48
at 12 miles, we're all locked up, a good, ready light or need fire.

1564
01:43:59.40 --> 01:44:05.32
And it was very rare that we didn't, we weren't bound by the rules of engagement.

1565
01:44:05.32 --> 01:44:13.80
We were cleared to fire 12 miles, Remson decides, we're going to sweeten the pot. So we go to 10 miles,

1566
01:44:13.80 --> 01:44:20.76
eight miles, and about 10 miles, we're going pretty fast, you know what I mean?

1567
01:44:22.12 --> 01:44:30.44
We get the call of salvo, salvo, salvo, salvo, from a red ground, which was the offshore air

1568
01:44:30.44 --> 01:44:38.68
controller and salvo means get out of there and they don't specify why. So Remson, we cross,

1569
01:44:38.68 --> 01:44:46.36
turned it, turned away and let these make 21s, which were coming down the pipe at us.

1570
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.36
We had to, we had to not fire. Now, two things could have happened. They could have been,

1571
01:44:54.36 --> 01:45:00.84
friend, at least, red crowns made mistakes on occasion. It's radar interpretation,

1572
01:45:01.56 --> 01:45:09.56
some distance. So that was immediate reaction. And then we hear, I was to God to hurt it.

1573
01:45:09.56 --> 01:45:15.64
The thunder go over the top, there's a rolling thunder going over the top. And the long beach

1574
01:45:15.64 --> 01:45:26.04
had fired Taylor's missiles and it shot him right over the top of us. You talk about being angry.

1575
01:45:27.16 --> 01:45:33.24
We got back to the boat and landed and found out what it was. And they shot down one and got

1576
01:45:33.24 --> 01:45:42.76
a probable one a second, make 21, which belonged to Remson and better. It's a, it's a crap

1577
01:45:42.76 --> 01:45:53.24
shoot. Yeah, you know, on a given day, do you get a chance that you train in years war? And

1578
01:45:53.24 --> 01:45:58.04
that one our day, so you want to get ready for the next day, like you say.

1579
01:46:02.60 --> 01:46:09.08
Eventually, you get to this point and again, I'm fast forwarding through stories and

1580
01:46:09.08 --> 01:46:18.12
details and personnel just awesome history. You get to this point. We were worn out, beat up,

1581
01:46:18.12 --> 01:46:26.12
and bitter. Between the end of February and the end of June, our 100 man air wing had lost 13

1582
01:46:26.12 --> 01:46:33.96
killed or captured. 10 bombers on F4 and a vigilante reconnaissance plan playing. Something was

1583
01:46:33.96 --> 01:46:39.80
very, very wrong. If we were going to regain the dominance that was Naval Aviation's birthright,

1584
01:46:39.80 --> 01:46:44.76
we would need to make changes. My orders were cut. I'd been assigned to the Phantom Fleet

1585
01:46:44.76 --> 01:46:50.68
Replacement Squadron at Naval Air Station, Miramar, as luck would have it there. In the bustling

1586
01:46:50.68 --> 01:46:58.20
on-clave of Fighter Squadron, 121, I would have the chance to help solve our costly, tragic problem.

1587
01:46:58.20 --> 01:47:09.72
So you get to Miramar. Fall 1968, Fighter Town USA. That's the longstanding nickname of the

1588
01:47:09.72 --> 01:47:13.88
Naval Air Station, who Spanish name Miramar doesn't even seem to suit the place. There's no

1589
01:47:13.88 --> 01:47:18.92
view of the sea from its location, 15 miles north of San Diego, five miles in from the coast,

1590
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:23.80
at least not until you've gone wheels up and you're flying west on that air controllers.

1591
01:47:23.80 --> 01:47:28.76
Well, what the air controllers call a sea wolf departure. Know the unofficial nickname painted

1592
01:47:28.76 --> 01:47:34.52
on Hangarwon is a much better fit. On the runways, ramps and taxiways of the sprawling complex,

1593
01:47:34.52 --> 01:47:39.80
the shriek of jet engines and the smell of aviation fuel is constant. If my love of flight had

1594
01:47:39.80 --> 01:47:44.20
been tested by war, I still never shook the habit of lifting my eyes to the sky whenever a jet

1595
01:47:44.20 --> 01:47:49.40
roared overhead. Who was it? How was he doing? What's going on? As an instructor, it was my job

1596
01:47:49.40 --> 01:47:54.04
to keep track of my nuggets. When I parked my sea bag at Miramar again, this time to serve as a

1597
01:47:54.04 --> 01:48:00.20
tactics instructor at Fighter Squadron 121, I found the pace of daily life, clipping along at a

1598
01:48:00.20 --> 01:48:05.40
fast wartime tempo. The whole West Coast Naval shore establishment had ramped up to support the

1599
01:48:05.40 --> 01:48:12.84
war in Vietnam and VF 121 was hauling a heavy load. I was an instructor in the advanced tactics phase

1600
01:48:12.84 --> 01:48:19.64
of the squadron. A good man, Lieutenant Commander Sam Leeds was the head of tactics.

1601
01:48:21.24 --> 01:48:26.20
Well, again, I'm jumping through some stuff here. What kept us from pushing the aerodynamic

1602
01:48:26.20 --> 01:48:32.20
limits? Because you talk about what you guys were doing to train and then you kind of have a caveat

1603
01:48:32.20 --> 01:48:36.84
that you weren't pushing as hard as you wanted to. What kept us from pushing the aerodynamic limits

1604
01:48:36.84 --> 01:48:42.20
was the risk of version that commonly afflix training. The worst thing we could do as far as our

1605
01:48:42.20 --> 01:48:49.56
higher headquarters was concerned was lose a plane. So twice a day, I took new fanom pilots

1606
01:48:49.56 --> 01:48:55.24
and their back seaters up to fly. We played it safe. We did air combat maneuvering or ACM,

1607
01:48:55.24 --> 01:49:01.56
but always within strict safety parameters. As a result, the program lacked combat realism.

1608
01:49:01.56 --> 01:49:05.32
The first time rag pilots saw the radical maneuvers that modern jets were capable of.

1609
01:49:05.32 --> 01:49:16.84
Tracers were flying. The rise had not been opened. That's not how you want to send a young man

1610
01:49:16.84 --> 01:49:23.000
after off to war. So you guys are training within some pretty strict confines.

1611
01:49:24.12 --> 01:49:28.20
And it's crazy to think that the first time a guy is really going to be able to test

1612
01:49:28.20 --> 01:49:34.76
is to maximize the maneuverability and the capability of the aircraft is going to be in combat.

1613
01:49:35.32 --> 01:49:38.68
It's ridiculous. But doing it for five years.

1614
01:49:41.72 --> 01:49:46.36
Luckily, not long after my arrival in late December, Sam leads call me into his office and

1615
01:49:46.36 --> 01:49:51.40
showed me a thick document bound in a blue cover. It was a study issued by the Naval Air Systems

1616
01:49:51.40 --> 01:49:59.16
Command. It's title, report of the air to air missile system capability review hardly sounded like a blockbuster.

1617
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:04.76
But this study produced by Captain Frank Alt, the captain of the coral sea, was an impressive

1618
01:50:04.76 --> 01:50:10.28
consequential piece of work. About 200 pages long, it was a top to bottom exploration of the

1619
01:50:10.28 --> 01:50:16.04
reasons for our failure in air to air combat over North Vietnam. Captain Alt's project had been a

1620
01:50:16.04 --> 01:50:20.44
long time coming. It began in the summer of 1968 when he led a team that tackled the problem of

1621
01:50:20.44 --> 01:50:26.04
the Sparrow missile. Building on that and other studies, he pulled in more than 200 people to a

1622
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:31.08
symposium at the Naval Air Missile Test Center at Point Magu North of Los Angeles.

1623
01:50:31.64 --> 01:50:36.12
There were pilots, commanders, and managers, and technicians from Raytheon Westinghouse,

1624
01:50:36.12 --> 01:50:42.04
and McDonald Douglass, all the major fighter weapons contractors, no one had put together the

1625
01:50:42.04 --> 01:50:48.76
entire picture of the problem like Alt had. It was the first time the whole air combat system

1626
01:50:48.76 --> 01:50:55.000
our fighters, their missiles, and fire control systems had been studied holistically from design and

1627
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.36
acquisition to operations and logistics. Alt wanted to understand weapon systems from the womb to

1628
01:51:00.36 --> 01:51:06.36
the tomb as he liked to say. His conclusions were far reaching. Sam leads called my attention to one

1629
01:51:06.36 --> 01:51:13.48
particular recommendation in the report. He flipped a page 37 and pointed to the 11th of the 15th

1630
01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:20.20
items listed in paragraph 6, air crew training. It was there that Alt advised the chief of

1631
01:51:20.20 --> 01:51:26.44
Naval Operations and the commander of Naval Air Forces, Pacific, to establish as early as possible

1632
01:51:26.44 --> 01:51:33.48
and advance fighter weapon school at NAS Miramar for both the F8 and the F4.

1633
01:51:34.60 --> 01:51:37.24
These were the words that gave birth to Top Gun.

1634
01:51:37.24 --> 01:51:44.92
Sam and I knew that any Miramar based tactics training program would run through us. He looked

1635
01:51:44.92 --> 01:51:49.32
at me and said, Dan, why don't you take it? I suppose this was generous of him. He had both

1636
01:51:49.32 --> 01:51:54.44
experience and seniority over me. He could have led the effort himself, but he had already had a great

1637
01:51:54.44 --> 01:51:58.60
job waiting for him. He was in the final running to command the first fighter squadron that would

1638
01:51:58.60 --> 01:52:04.12
fly the new F14 Tomcat. Sam could have easily taken the assignment to start a new school house,

1639
01:52:04.12 --> 01:52:09.80
to start a new school house and then he handed off to me when his time came to fly the F14s,

1640
01:52:09.80 --> 01:52:14.68
but he felt the school should have the same leadership from the beginning for continuity sake.

1641
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:19.80
He said as much and strongly. It was settled then and there. I made it quick, faithful decision.

1642
01:52:20.68 --> 01:52:28.20
I do it. And you're what? Lieutenant Commander right now? At this point? 31 years old, Lieutenant

1643
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:38.52
Commander, I was probably going above about 50 years old, tired, fatigue, and as a great opportunity.

1644
01:52:38.52 --> 01:52:50.28
I mean, that is the best gift in a career somebody gave me. Frank Alt, the all report,

1645
01:52:50.28 --> 01:52:56.36
Marvel's document, unsolicited. He did that on his own. It wasn't asked for.

1646
01:52:56.36 --> 01:53:04.60
He told us what was wrong in detail, but he never taught. They've got blessing. He never

1647
01:53:04.60 --> 01:53:12.28
mandated what to do about it. He just said, I want to graduate school. It's to get well program

1648
01:53:12.84 --> 01:53:21.32
in the shortest amount of time. Somebody in endorsing him when it was approved and sent to 121.

1649
01:53:21.32 --> 01:53:30.44
They put in two months and we don't have any space for you. We don't have a building. We don't

1650
01:53:30.44 --> 01:53:38.60
have any airplanes. I don't have any support people, but you got two months to make the school.

1651
01:53:39.88 --> 01:53:46.84
And teach a first class. Now this is a graduate school, Taco. This is not what we've been

1652
01:53:46.84 --> 01:53:55.24
teaching for five years. Can you imagine the confrontation you're going to get from the existing

1653
01:53:55.24 --> 01:54:00.60
squad and commanders? I don't know. And these are O5. The squadron commanders at this time were

1654
01:54:00.60 --> 01:54:07.40
they O5. So you're juniored all these guys. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful. It will be all on the

1655
01:54:07.40 --> 01:54:12.52
what that's like. Yeah. You say soon we started calling the school top gun. We weren't the first to

1656
01:54:12.52 --> 01:54:17.000
use this nickname. There was an annual weapons competition that used the same name until about

1657
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.92
1958. The aircraft carrier Ranger, which I would later command called itself the top gun in the

1658
01:54:22.92 --> 01:54:32.20
Pacific Fleet. You can't. You can't write every day Navy fighter weapons school. You got to

1659
01:54:32.20 --> 01:54:46.28
have a nickname and top gun just seemed to work. That's it. And they liked it. You had to, you know,

1660
01:54:46.28 --> 01:54:52.68
you had the goal of top gun wasn't just to teach pilots, but to make those pilots kind of

1661
01:54:52.68 --> 01:54:59.48
teach into teachers themselves. Oh, that's it. That's the answer. It's like a teachers college.

1662
01:54:59.48 --> 01:55:06.60
In other words, you got to teach people that are going out of the fleet in the solicitation. We did

1663
01:55:07.40 --> 01:55:16.12
in the initial solicitation to bring in students that send your two best. The two best nuggets

1664
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.96
or Lieutenant's or below from your squadron. I mean, of course, some of the some of the

1665
01:55:23.96 --> 01:55:33.32
reaction, we don't want to put it on tape here. But the idea was those two guys who come back,

1666
01:55:33.32 --> 01:55:43.80
we'd form a cat in about six weeks. We'd teach in graduate school and they go back out and they teach

1667
01:55:43.80 --> 01:55:54.04
their entire school under the new tactics. So it's colorful. You uh, the lore behind this is awesome.

1668
01:55:54.04 --> 01:56:02.84
You you go into selecting the first originally you call them. And I have to at least just kind of

1669
01:56:02.84 --> 01:56:06.84
run through some of the highlights. The stories you got behind these guys are awesome.

1670
01:56:06.84 --> 01:56:13.64
Uh, Mel Holmes, the first round pick by anybody's book. One time Mel was golfing at Basin,

1671
01:56:13.64 --> 01:56:17.96
of course, in Merimar, he had a drive into the weeds. That was bad news for the nest of rattle

1672
01:56:17.96 --> 01:56:22.20
snakes he walked into while looking for his ball. When his buddies saw him hacking away with his

1673
01:56:22.20 --> 01:56:28.60
seven iron slaughtering those serpents in the grass, Holmes had his nickname, Wrathler. He had one

1674
01:56:28.60 --> 01:56:35.24
trait in spades that I strongly doubt is teachable, a bone deep, hardwired electric fire sense of aggression.

1675
01:56:35.24 --> 01:56:42.60
I chose John Smash Nash for the way his heart mined work together. Any suggestion that a

1676
01:56:42.60 --> 01:56:47.96
mismatch was at hand triggered his compited his competitive fire. His motto, I'd rather die than

1677
01:56:47.96 --> 01:56:55.24
lose, bore it out. Most combat pilots were our wired that way. What Matt, what made Nash special was

1678
01:56:55.24 --> 01:57:01.24
the way he combined that fire with hyper attention to detail. Jim Rullison, as I say that right?

1679
01:57:01.24 --> 01:57:10.04
Jim Rullison probably put out more intellectual wattage than any of us. Jerry Sootsky, or Skiebert,

1680
01:57:10.04 --> 01:57:16.76
as I called him, had played linebacker for Bear Bryant at Alabama. We appreciated him for being as

1681
01:57:16.76 --> 01:57:23.08
reliable as gravity. And then so there's your pilots and then without a good backseater, you get into the

1682
01:57:23.08 --> 01:57:29.24
the reos at the head of the pack was JC Smith, who I invited right away. He might have been the

1683
01:57:29.24 --> 01:57:36.28
finest real there ever was. You also had Jim Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Lang? Is that right?

1684
01:57:36.28 --> 01:57:42.52
Do you mean Lang? Say new. A youngster, just 23 years old, so quiet and person you'd never know,

1685
01:57:42.52 --> 01:57:47.48
he was a tiger in the rear seat during his two combat tours in Vietnam flying from the Kitty Hawk.

1686
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:55.64
He and his pilot, named, flamed a Meg 17 in a wild fight near high fong harbor. Lang survived

1687
01:57:55.64 --> 01:58:06.44
two ejections in barely a month. I don't even know what to say about surviving two ejections in a

1688
01:58:06.44 --> 01:58:12.68
month. That's just crazy. You'd like to mean him. It'd be a good interview. Well, he's obviously

1689
01:58:12.68 --> 01:58:20.12
open invite whenever he wants. I'll be standing by our other Smith Steve had all the

1690
01:58:20.12 --> 01:58:24.12
essentials of a top grade reel that stood apart from everybody for his skills as a salesman,

1691
01:58:24.12 --> 01:58:30.52
organizer and grifter for all seasons. Our junior Rio, Lieutenant Junior Grade, Darrell Gary,

1692
01:58:30.52 --> 01:58:34.76
was the youngest man in a cadre of founders. He had every attribute I wanted instructor,

1693
01:58:34.76 --> 01:58:40.92
mature beyond his years, confident beneath his years and very hard working. Last find was Chuck

1694
01:58:40.92 --> 01:58:47.48
Hilderbrand and he was an intel guy. So you brought him to help you guys with the intel side of

1695
01:58:47.48 --> 01:58:53.80
figuring out what other aircraft consisted of what they're capable of. One to become the

1696
01:58:54.68 --> 01:59:03.16
central repository of tactical aviation within Navy. Navy had none of them. They were classified

1697
01:59:03.16 --> 01:59:09.88
at all. It's over CIA, CIA headquarters, up to that point. So I wanted to build it and it

1698
01:59:10.36 --> 01:59:16.36
works that way now. And you guys basically did you basically steal a trailer for this organization?

1699
01:59:16.36 --> 01:59:24.36
That's a great story. You love it. We're just fussing our hump to get ready in two months.

1700
01:59:25.56 --> 01:59:34.76
There's no op order for this. There's no plan. It's winging it. Whatever, whatever is fair,

1701
01:59:34.76 --> 01:59:41.32
just do it and get it done. The individual guys had and I've been flying with these railies

1702
01:59:41.32 --> 01:59:48.84
often on. And I learned from this railies when you got a lot done on a tight schedule. You

1703
01:59:48.84 --> 01:59:56.20
have to do things. Get people that are intellectually or professionally excellent in given technical

1704
01:59:56.20 --> 02:00:08.76
areas. So these guys all have their expertise to start with. And Steve Smith, who

1705
02:00:08.76 --> 02:00:16.76
probably should be a felon, and he's a wealthy one with that now. But at the time, you know,

1706
02:00:16.76 --> 02:00:24.12
he gave, he'd make a list of things to do every day. And by he and I'd work together in early

1707
02:00:24.12 --> 02:00:32.04
morning and by evening time and this got all done. Is that kind of guy? Get it done.

1708
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:41.40
Personal, great. And one Friday early in the morning, I said, damn, I said, we're really moving

1709
02:00:41.40 --> 02:00:49.08
forward. Paperwork wise. Plan why? And the taxi. Really looking good. But I said, we don't even have

1710
02:00:49.08 --> 02:01:00.20
a place to start holding formalizes thing. And I said, but I got an idea. So I sat him down

1711
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:07.96
behind Bay Sobs at Mermort. And he comes back on Saturday morning with a big 40 foot crank

1712
02:01:08.52 --> 02:01:17.000
hanging below it. Is a 20 by 40 building, which is a pictures that are in the book of the original

1713
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.88
he had stolen this thing. He had brought the crane operator with a case of Scott to which I

1714
02:01:23.88 --> 02:01:35.000
ended up buying. And they bring it down. And you know, the pace of things was such that I said,

1715
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.48
you got what? And the guys were all laughing. Whole place was laughing. Go out. And here's a

1716
02:01:41.48 --> 02:01:49.08
CEO's parking spots all along the street. And here's his crane with his big building. Suspended

1717
02:01:49.08 --> 02:01:56.60
below it. He said, where do you want to put it? I said, you put it right here by the steps leading

1718
02:01:56.60 --> 02:02:05.000
up to fight her down hangar, but right here right above the CEOs parking spot. One 21. And we

1719
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.48
got away with it. So Sunday he says, I got a bunch of flooring. We're going to put new flooring

1720
02:02:11.48 --> 02:02:19.64
in the building today. So everybody came in and we hammered nails and glued down new flooring in there.

1721
02:02:20.20 --> 02:02:27.80
And he brings in red paint. And we painted the trim on the building. All red. I said,

1722
02:02:27.80 --> 02:02:35.08
what an hell is you do it in red for? He said, who would believe you'd steal a building and paint

1723
02:02:35.08 --> 02:02:42.84
red. This is a mentality that you're dealing with. And and by God Monday morning,

1724
02:02:42.84 --> 02:02:51.80
income some vans that Nevada license plates. And I think he had been up to Nellus and stole

1725
02:02:51.80 --> 02:02:59.56
a bunch of salvage furniture from the Air Force. But he brought in desks and chairs and

1726
02:02:59.56 --> 02:03:07.48
and in safe. He got a couple of safe. This was a kind of guy. And it whipped it out three days.

1727
02:03:09.16 --> 02:03:19.48
We started we started the classroom then. That's epic. You say here, before we could teach

1728
02:03:19.48 --> 02:03:23.72
the material, we had to study and learn it called ourselves. We created, collated,

1729
02:03:23.72 --> 02:03:29.32
and corrected the curriculum at a fever pace, working all hours to refine it, hunting and

1730
02:03:29.32 --> 02:03:33.24
packing with two fingers on manual typewriters, redlining each other's drafts for hercing lectures to

1731
02:03:33.24 --> 02:03:38.28
each other. This last part was key as we took turns on the podium and the trailer. We faced

1732
02:03:39.72 --> 02:03:43.56
we faced withering scrutiny from our fellow instructors in the military. This is known as a

1733
02:03:43.56 --> 02:03:50.04
murder board. No hiccup in presentation style. No slip of the tongue. No glitch in dress or personal

1734
02:03:50.04 --> 02:03:56.20
appearance was too small to be seized upon and corrected on the spot. We knew we would be ineffective

1735
02:03:56.20 --> 02:04:00.84
lecturing our top not students if we were anything less than bulletproof. How would they believe

1736
02:04:00.84 --> 02:04:06.84
us at top going if we couldn't deliver graduate level lessons well? In the meantime, we began

1737
02:04:06.84 --> 02:04:10.52
reaching out to the fleets squadrons to recruit their students. It's interesting to me. I found

1738
02:04:10.52 --> 02:04:17.32
that part. Interesting that you guys went hyper professional. You went, hey, we are going to be

1739
02:04:17.32 --> 02:04:22.76
over the top professional because you could see the attitude, hey, we're doing this. We're kind of

1740
02:04:22.76 --> 02:04:27.72
flying by the seat of our pants. I will teach you kind of half-hazard. You guys went hyper professional.

1741
02:04:27.72 --> 02:04:37.64
That was an awesome move. In the forward to the book, the Edeliments and then murder boarding

1742
02:04:37.64 --> 02:04:46.28
has a night element. It took us a while to analyze. We we-we-wined it to get it going. But once we

1743
02:04:46.28 --> 02:04:55.64
got it up in it with successful, we had to set the standards high because nobody believed you know,

1744
02:04:55.64 --> 02:05:01.08
it was the same type of thing that we had been doing for five years. It wasn't going to fly.

1745
02:05:01.96 --> 02:05:10.76
But just make it special and it's still that way. Is it not? 100%. 100% that legacy has

1746
02:05:10.76 --> 02:05:17.000
sustained from the beginning. In the elements are in the forward to that book. No. And they're

1747
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.96
applicable to commercial enterprise. You'd be amazed who I've lectured on those. I wouldn't be

1748
02:05:23.96 --> 02:05:31.000
as I wouldn't be surprised at all. I know the, I know that the principles that we learned in the

1749
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:40.04
military are extremely applicable to any leadership situation. Sorry. You're just about to start

1750
02:05:40.04 --> 02:05:45.16
the first class. And you say this, I was cooking along in full afterburner about 100 miles off the

1751
02:05:45.16 --> 02:05:50.76
California coast approaching San Clemente Island when I felt the thump. My warning panel lit up.

1752
02:05:50.76 --> 02:05:56.36
There was a fire in my right engine. As I shut it down, my back seat or lieutenant J. G. G. Gill

1753
02:05:56.36 --> 02:06:02.68
slimy ran through the emergency checklist while Mel eased in close for a visual inspection

1754
02:06:02.68 --> 02:06:07.72
trying to see through all the smoke. We were about 30 miles from Miramar, off La Jolla,

1755
02:06:07.72 --> 02:06:13.80
when the seven-liter liquid auction canister mounted in the tail of my phantom exploded.

1756
02:06:14.60 --> 02:06:18.92
It tore the tail section clean off my bird and over and we tumbled,

1757
02:06:18.92 --> 02:06:24.36
time slowed down. We plummeted. In my headset, I think I heard Mel's voice,

1758
02:06:24.36 --> 02:06:30.68
Dan, you guys eject, eject, Gill pulled the handle and we rocketed out of the doom jet.

1759
02:06:31.40 --> 02:06:36.04
We fell toward the ocean strapped into our ejection seats at 21,000 feet.

1760
02:06:36.04 --> 02:06:40.76
It's odd how time passes in a crisis inspired by the flood of adrenaline into my system.

1761
02:06:40.76 --> 02:06:45.48
I'd time to look down over La Jolla, notice the scenic curve. My helmet visor was gone,

1762
02:06:45.48 --> 02:06:50.60
but somehow my Ray-Band sunglasses were still hanging on. I've got to save them, I thought.

1763
02:06:50.60 --> 02:06:54.92
Those sunglasses had been with me since my Pensacola training days. No way did I want to lose them

1764
02:06:54.92 --> 02:07:00.68
now. I reached up, shook them off my face and stuffed them into a zippered pocket on my flight suit.

1765
02:07:00.68 --> 02:07:05.88
It was then that I realized as I fell through space that I was still attached to my ejection seat.

1766
02:07:05.88 --> 02:07:10.68
This was a problem. The heavy apparatus was supposed to separate automatically by action of a

1767
02:07:10.68 --> 02:07:16.84
powerful spring activated by barestad at 12,000 feet. Falling toward the sea, I looked around for

1768
02:07:16.84 --> 02:07:23.000
Gill's shoot and was relieved to see him drifting down behind an above me. This engaged myself,

1769
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.36
disengaging myself manually from the ejection seat and falling clear, I pulled the D-Ring to pop my

1770
02:07:28.36 --> 02:07:34.60
shoot. Nothing happened. I yanked it again harder and the cable broke off in my glove hand.

1771
02:07:34.60 --> 02:07:38.68
I was falling at terminal velocity 14 feet per second like a rock.

1772
02:07:39.64 --> 02:07:45.32
Somehow I had to get my hands on the shoot pack. Short on time and altitude, I pulled myself

1773
02:07:45.32 --> 02:07:50.92
up the risers and reached my shoot pack. I thought of my wife and kids and home and it was

1774
02:07:50.92 --> 02:07:56.28
God who gave me the strength. I'm sure reaching the parachute pack, I opened it with my hands

1775
02:07:56.28 --> 02:08:04.12
and the shoot flew free. The beautiful white blossom swelled above me jerking me upright into a lazy

1776
02:08:04.12 --> 02:08:13.40
but short descent. Thank you, my dear Lord. Is that your first ejection? Only. Only ejection.

1777
02:08:14.12 --> 02:08:19.56
You had to climb up the risers of your parachute and yanked that thing out. That's very

1778
02:08:19.56 --> 02:08:27.56
different. Okay. It was not a big deal to have a malfunctioning parachute after you ejected out

1779
02:08:27.56 --> 02:08:33.56
of your F-4 fan and with the engine exploded. I was going to be impressed.

1780
02:08:33.56 --> 02:08:39.96
The next line gets even better. Yeah, looking down at the cold water, I saw the dark,

1781
02:08:39.96 --> 02:08:46.12
sleek shadows swimming just below the surface. Yeah, people don't, I mean you're off the coast

1782
02:08:46.12 --> 02:08:53.16
of Southern California. There's sharks. There are and actually people know this now because you

1783
02:08:53.16 --> 02:08:58.52
know we have drones flying around and now that they fly drones all over the place, people are all

1784
02:08:58.52 --> 02:09:03.88
shocked that there's a bunch of sharks out there like I'm a surfer and people are now realizing,

1785
02:09:03.88 --> 02:09:10.44
oh there's sharks right off the coast of where we surf and you know I said the sharks have always

1786
02:09:10.44 --> 02:09:16.84
been there. That's their home, you know. So you can kind of visualize some sharks as you were

1787
02:09:16.84 --> 02:09:23.40
inbound? Well, I looked down and they saw the silhouette in the dark and this was 15 minutes

1788
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:34.76
for dark and the water's cold, 13th of February and so I hit the water and then my little raft

1789
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:45.64
disinflated so I climb in this, because I can, it's cold man and I think I was motivated by the

1790
02:09:45.64 --> 02:09:52.84
thought it was probably sharks turns out it was dolphin because where my big boots were sitting

1791
02:09:52.84 --> 02:10:00.76
on the end of the raft, pretty soon boom, boom, two snouts turn up and these squeaky little levels

1792
02:10:00.76 --> 02:10:07.16
were sitting there looking at me. You guys are probably swam with those people. And they're talking,

1793
02:10:07.16 --> 02:10:14.04
they're children, they're excited to have somebody new and the world. I got rescued by heel

1794
02:10:14.04 --> 02:10:16.76
that night. Yeah.

1795
02:10:18.76 --> 02:10:24.68
March 3rd, 1969 in our stolen trailer at Fidertown USA Top Guns, Class One convened

1796
02:10:24.68 --> 02:10:30.28
and I had to throw this in there. I issued a heartfelt welcome aboard and said we'd been

1797
02:10:30.28 --> 02:10:33.40
charged with an important purpose. This is you talking to your students for the first time.

1798
02:10:34.04 --> 02:10:38.76
I introduced my instructor team and told them who we all were. I explained that we would all

1799
02:10:38.76 --> 02:10:44.92
learn together along the way. The main thing for any skipper to bear in mind is this. The troops

1800
02:10:45.80 --> 02:10:51.56
know the troops need to know he's interested in their welfare. This is true regardless of the

1801
02:10:51.56 --> 02:10:57.08
leader's personal communication style. Hard asses can care too. Some leaders give lip service to

1802
02:10:57.08 --> 02:11:04.36
caring but what a leader does it does to show it is far more important. I wanted my instructors

1803
02:11:04.36 --> 02:11:10.28
to challenge them but always constructively. We would aspire to build their confidence not destroy it.

1804
02:11:10.28 --> 02:11:16.12
They were professionals and future mentors in training so we were going to show them how it was

1805
02:11:16.12 --> 02:11:21.24
done. I close by saying there is an urgency here beyond anything we've ever done. We

1806
02:11:21.24 --> 02:11:25.96
hold lives in our hands. These words still fill me with conviction today.

1807
02:11:27.56 --> 02:11:33.56
So this was a like you said a graduate level school and you're treating these people more as peers

1808
02:11:33.56 --> 02:11:39.96
than as you know people that weren't worthy of being there and that needed to bow down to you guys.

1809
02:11:42.36 --> 02:11:48.20
None of that. There's a brotherhood in dealing and you guys know that.

1810
02:11:48.20 --> 02:11:55.56
Dealing new in life every single day. Yours there's they knew why they were there.

1811
02:11:56.52 --> 02:12:00.60
They were there to get better so they wouldn't go out and get themselves back.

1812
02:12:02.76 --> 02:12:13.08
And their big because their sensibility a jaw-caught think is we made it known right from the

1813
02:12:13.08 --> 02:12:21.16
first time they got the date they were there to become proficient teacher on score the mates

1814
02:12:22.52 --> 02:12:28.44
and boy that stuck. They're pride. Pride and being the top gun instructor right David.

1815
02:12:29.40 --> 02:12:32.04
It's not an easy way to get there sir.

1816
02:12:37.32 --> 02:12:42.04
The pace of the program accelerated once we began flying a lot after the first week or so we ran

1817
02:12:42.04 --> 02:12:46.20
two or three training sororities every day with the instructors playing the role of aggressors.

1818
02:12:46.20 --> 02:12:50.52
We would put the students in different scenarios flying all the basic permutations.

1819
02:12:50.52 --> 02:12:55.08
One versus one two versus one one versus two two versus two four versus two four versus four

1820
02:12:55.08 --> 02:13:00.44
and two versus four. A dogfight is a true physical ordeal when a fighter aircraft is flown hard.

1821
02:13:00.44 --> 02:13:05.56
It shakes you like a plummeting roller coaster on the verge of collapse. Your buffeted from side to side

1822
02:13:05.56 --> 02:13:09.64
helmet hammering the plexiglass canopy harness digging into your shoulders and hips.

1823
02:13:09.64 --> 02:13:14.52
GeForce is caused blood to surge and drain from your extremities including your head.

1824
02:13:14.52 --> 02:13:17.48
Our program tested not only a student's body but his mind.

1825
02:13:19.80 --> 02:13:24.04
Fast forward a little bit. There were a couple names for the mid-killing new tactics we developed

1826
02:13:24.04 --> 02:13:31.32
in the F4 community. It basically involved flying a fan or fan of like a Saturn V rocket straight up.

1827
02:13:31.32 --> 02:13:36.12
Sometimes we called it using the vertical envelope. It was also known as the high yo yo.

1828
02:13:36.12 --> 02:13:41.56
But the name we settled on was inspired by the shape of the airspace we used while flying it.

1829
02:13:41.56 --> 02:13:47.16
JC Smith called it the egg and the moniker stuck. That was the shape our fanom's track

1830
02:13:47.16 --> 02:13:53.72
rocketing up and coming back down. So you guys are starting to come up with new tactics, new methods.

1831
02:13:55.88 --> 02:14:05.56
The F4 is greatest attribute to magnificent Indians and it would go up and no

1832
02:14:05.56 --> 02:14:13.24
makes ever stay way. We learned to fly. I'm flown zero air feet on the back up here.

1833
02:14:13.24 --> 02:14:22.12
Just two pilot, free fighter and gauge fighter. One guy is down push in the makes.

1834
02:14:22.12 --> 02:14:29.64
The other guy comes in and goes right to sweet spot to shoot. We got very good at it.

1835
02:14:29.64 --> 02:14:37.48
And we flew the airplane way beyond what McDonald's was sold them for.

1836
02:14:38.84 --> 02:14:43.48
So you're putting, are you putting this thing into a stall when you reach the apex of the

1837
02:14:43.48 --> 02:14:46.36
vertical or you get close to it but you have to back off?

1838
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.88
She behaves, take her up to where you're comfortable and what you see down below.

1839
02:14:51.88 --> 02:14:59.96
Sometimes you get really slow up here. Sometimes you go to zero and the airplane would behave so well.

1840
02:14:59.96 --> 02:15:10.44
Use rotters not a lot. Aileron but rotters and I've flown the airplane straight into

1841
02:15:10.44 --> 02:15:17.80
a piraticle to zero air speed. Full afterburner leave it there and come back down and we did it to

1842
02:15:17.80 --> 02:15:26.20
make sure what the airplane would do in case you got up here and some nugget didn't get it over

1843
02:15:26.92 --> 02:15:35.000
on its backside to fly straight up afterburner's going and cheat chugs and she didn't like it very

1844
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.96
much but she comes down just like this to fall through on her belly and goes out the bottom

1845
02:15:39.96 --> 02:15:46.68
and name a McDonald's or an award. I'm going to stay with you through that and we did that and I made the

1846
02:15:46.68 --> 02:15:55.48
guys each one of them. I went up and demoed it put a student in the back seat and made him

1847
02:15:55.48 --> 02:16:01.24
getting a front seat and I climbed the back. No flight controls in the back seat at her point

1848
02:16:01.80 --> 02:16:10.68
and I ride through that in the back seat and when that was over he is confidence was well.

1849
02:16:10.68 --> 02:16:21.80
It worked great. That's a basic tag. Flung the vertical. You say flying every day we worked

1850
02:16:21.80 --> 02:16:26.52
on all this and we worked hard we developed the egg in a way that made excellent use of our

1851
02:16:26.52 --> 02:16:33.64
two plane loose-dose formation which basically with loose-dose talk talk us through the loose-dose

1852
02:16:33.64 --> 02:16:42.52
formation a little bit. That's just two airplanes mutual support at the key okay. You got to be able

1853
02:16:42.52 --> 02:16:47.72
to when you're cruising through Indian country you got to be able to keep them off your six

1854
02:16:47.72 --> 02:16:52.92
you know when you get shot and you don't want you to get shot and from this position they can

1855
02:16:52.92 --> 02:17:01.64
cross turn and they can clear each other or not more war to from reading and and so you get in the

1856
02:17:01.64 --> 02:17:07.96
Indian country and you got mixed and you come through the merge maybe you're also a little bit

1857
02:17:07.96 --> 02:17:16.20
but come through the merge and mix them down. You passed it and one of them becomes a free fighter

1858
02:17:16.20 --> 02:17:22.36
he goes into vertical the other one comes around try and push and mix and you're trying to push

1859
02:17:22.36 --> 02:17:29.40
them into predictability. Make drivers are like everybody they want to stay alive and some

1860
02:17:29.40 --> 02:17:36.76
mummar very a degrees of expertise some mummar too good some mummar excellent you know the

1861
02:17:36.76 --> 02:17:44.28
top-maked driver in Norvian I'm got nine nine vectors and serious business so any free fighter

1862
02:17:44.28 --> 02:17:53.000
this guy up here would always try and come down it's a I'm in two's off or you know that's where we

1863
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:58.60
that's how we ended up with the call signs so we have because you can't can't relate numbers

1864
02:17:59.32 --> 02:18:09.08
to each other you got to have a you know rivals in thanks off right when when the second aircraft

1865
02:18:09.08 --> 02:18:13.48
goes starts to go up when the first aircraft comes down is in is the other one now taking the

1866
02:18:13.48 --> 02:18:19.48
opposition yeah yeah it's keep track of the makes makes remember don't have the power to get

1867
02:18:19.48 --> 02:18:25.72
up with the family and that they're in a lot of strength yeah so you keep pushing down there don't let

1868
02:18:25.72 --> 02:18:32.92
them get fast just push them down and eventually one of you one potato two potatoes one of

1869
02:18:32.92 --> 02:18:39.88
you will get a valid shot by the side one and oh god if I ever wanted anything in my flying

1870
02:18:39.88 --> 02:18:49.88
bird I wanted a gun and a family never had a gun I know I could have won every fight with a gun

1871
02:18:50.68 --> 02:18:58.20
gadlin gun this this concept of of the loose-dose formation you know even when you said mutually

1872
02:18:58.20 --> 02:19:04.76
supporting you know in in ground tactics right we have the principle of cover move which means

1873
02:19:04.76 --> 02:19:09.40
we're gonna work together when one person's moving the other person's shooting or you know

1874
02:19:09.40 --> 02:19:13.08
keep in the enemy distracted yeah the allows the other person move to a better position a

1875
02:19:13.08 --> 02:19:17.24
superior position you and they're gonna follow up the other interesting thing you said about how you

1876
02:19:17.24 --> 02:19:25.32
could use ones and twos uh my first deployment to Iraq you know we had the humvies were numbered

1877
02:19:25.32 --> 02:19:30.76
one two three four five six so you go out on target and everyone's assigned what vehicle you're

1878
02:19:30.76 --> 02:19:36.76
gonna get into one two three four five six well because of the arranged so you go assault the target

1879
02:19:36.76 --> 02:19:44.20
and the the vehicles would rearrange to so when you got back in and we could leave immediately

1880
02:19:44.20 --> 02:19:48.92
well they wouldn't always rearrange in the right order and so what you'd end up with a guy that

1881
02:19:48.92 --> 02:19:53.000
came in vehicle to he'd come out of an assault he'd look and he'd see vehicle number two and he'd

1882
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.36
go jump in it because he thought it was you know he'd count down the others number one there's

1883
02:19:56.36 --> 02:20:00.92
number two I came in vehicle two well that that wasn't accurate and you'd have guys going to the

1884
02:20:00.92 --> 02:20:06.04
wrong vehicles and so we ended up I said we're gonna name the vehicles and you're gonna know what

1885
02:20:06.04 --> 02:20:11.96
vehicle you're in by name because that way hey if I came in big earn or whatever you know

1886
02:20:11.96 --> 02:20:15.48
bigger and was the humvie I came in cool I get out I said I'm looking I'm not looking for a number I'm

1887
02:20:15.48 --> 02:20:20.44
looking for big earn and that way my team is gonna be together we can get a quick head count same same

1888
02:20:20.44 --> 02:20:28.60
idea yeah loose doose is that what you guys did two days it's almost exactly the same I mean

1889
02:20:28.60 --> 02:20:32.76
the terminology is the same all the things he's talking about everything that that they are talking

1890
02:20:32.76 --> 02:20:38.12
about has to stay into this day almost the exact same approach only anything changes is the

1891
02:20:38.12 --> 02:20:44.36
opposition zero points your own airplane the weapon system that they're giving you to fly

1892
02:20:45.56 --> 02:20:54.28
and that's therein lies the complexity of being a top-gun instructor because it's a constant

1893
02:20:54.28 --> 02:21:02.68
dynamic they have got to work to stay ahead of the potential enemies if it'd be China if it'd be

1894
02:21:02.68 --> 02:21:11.64
Russia everybody in the free world is working to keep their intelligence and their tactics

1895
02:21:13.80 --> 02:21:24.20
revised if you will it's a full-time dynamic business hard work you say this about the loose

1896
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:30.52
doose the loose doose tactic reflected top-guns culture and this is why I called this out

1897
02:21:30.52 --> 02:21:35.40
because it's not just the tactic that you use in the air which empowered junior officers to act

1898
02:21:35.40 --> 02:21:40.36
and speak freely there was no leader wingman hierarchy in our tactics which left either fighter

1899
02:21:40.36 --> 02:21:46.12
free to attack depending on who stage or depending on who cited a bogey first loose doose was

1900
02:21:46.12 --> 02:21:51.56
a versatile and aggressive certainly was a far cry from the air force's tactic the fluid for which

1901
02:21:51.56 --> 02:21:59.000
in spite of its adjective was quite rigid giving the initiative and most opportunities to the flight

1902
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:08.12
leaders life at top-gun was flight club every day as the instructors flew against the students it

1903
02:22:08.12 --> 02:22:13.56
was natural for the students to want to take a scalp now and then if one of them beat Wrathler,

1904
02:22:13.56 --> 02:22:20.92
Smash, Swatsky, Cobra, or me it could help his service reputation they seldom did it but by the end

1905
02:22:20.92 --> 02:22:27.16
of the syllabus and its 26 flights it did happen there was plenty of pride to be taken in that

1906
02:22:27.16 --> 02:22:32.68
I tried to keep them grounded everybody gets beaten now and then I told them if you managed to beat

1907
02:22:32.68 --> 02:22:40.04
Mel and were smart you understood it was dangerous to pump your ego the lesson there was that if

1908
02:22:40.04 --> 02:22:47.08
Mel could get beat anyone could I consider this attitude the heart of professionalism

1909
02:22:47.08 --> 02:22:52.52
and why and as for my instructors from time to time I had to warn them no ego's fellow we're

1910
02:22:52.52 --> 02:22:59.56
fellas we're here to teach that lesson right there of when you beat the best guy and you go yeah

1911
02:22:59.56 --> 02:23:07.24
I just beat the best guy what the real lesson is you can get beat to that's a powerful thing to think about

1912
02:23:07.80 --> 02:23:15.96
that's turning your ego right on its head but yeah you got a train to take on the best there is

1913
02:23:15.96 --> 02:23:24.28
every time your your whole goal in training is to beat the very best if he comes comes out someday

1914
02:23:25.48 --> 02:23:30.20
better be ready yeah when I was in charge of training seals for deployment

1915
02:23:30.68 --> 02:23:34.76
the people that they fought against in training for deployment was other seals

1916
02:23:35.40 --> 02:23:39.56
that knew their tactics that had the same conditioning that had the same weapons that

1917
02:23:39.56 --> 02:23:46.84
actually knew what their plan was they they there's no one that would ever face a tougher enemy

1918
02:23:47.56 --> 02:23:52.12
then you're gonna face going through seal pre pre pre deployment training the tougher on

1919
02:23:52.12 --> 02:23:59.80
enemy does not exist that's really interesting it's the same exact attitude that you guys had you know

1920
02:23:59.80 --> 02:24:05.88
and I I talked to Dave on the phone yesterday said this is the exact same attitude that we had in

1921
02:24:05.88 --> 02:24:11.72
the seal teams is how do we push ourselves against the hardest possible situation we can be in

1922
02:24:11.72 --> 02:24:17.16
so when we go in a combat it seems easy that's our goal make combat seem easy yeah

1923
02:24:18.76 --> 02:24:25.40
well you can't lead you can't lead in good concepts if you don't train that way absolutely

1924
02:24:25.40 --> 02:24:34.12
you can't be the leader no um there's a the next section you start talking about you kind of

1925
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:42.20
mentioned it earlier was was paradise ranch groomlake dreamland all the same names for

1926
02:24:42.20 --> 02:24:50.52
something that probably most people have heard the name area 51 and out there will you

1927
02:24:50.52 --> 02:24:55.64
talked about it you can you fly out there and these guys had a couple captured

1928
02:24:55.64 --> 02:25:03.08
meaks my first one others a lot of things going on out there and we won't go into it but I went out

1929
02:25:03.08 --> 02:25:09.16
there and flew I went out flew a couple tests I flew five six times I flew the meaks

1930
02:25:10.04 --> 02:25:17.40
because I wanted the experience male homes and I did that and that was the first trip out and then

1931
02:25:17.40 --> 02:25:27.16
later on when the first class graduated I surprised them I briefed the mission and we

1932
02:25:27.16 --> 02:25:36.04
put them in I think I led and probably male led and we took them to dreamland unknown

1933
02:25:37.32 --> 02:25:43.24
and we go smoking in the dreamland a nice easy 500 knots in the dreamland

1934
02:25:43.24 --> 02:25:51.56
when ever where we go and what are we going to do you know a radio silence right here comes

1935
02:25:51.56 --> 02:25:59.16
some makes the guys got to fight the makes for a graduation present and unknown

1936
02:26:00.20 --> 02:26:07.40
and it's surprised to hell a lot of that is and you know they did they really got it all

1937
02:26:07.40 --> 02:26:14.60
and they were good and they flew the tactics we had taught them and they held their own

1938
02:26:16.36 --> 02:26:25.96
and then what a party we had a mirror my life yeah that's that's completely epic

1939
02:26:26.68 --> 02:26:31.000
I didn't catch that right didn't recall it right yeah I probably didn't catch that the first time

1940
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.24
you did that they was surprised to them and they're just looking all the way positively

1941
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:40.76
I did it by a mic I just read coming those days and said you get we're going we get

1942
02:26:40.76 --> 02:26:49.000
off in section section take off and I had three up with me I think I said just just follow me

1943
02:26:49.72 --> 02:26:55.88
and I said be ready we go need knee and country that's all I told them and so they've speculated

1944
02:26:55.88 --> 02:27:00.92
all the way out there speculated one they away what's the crazy man doing now

1945
02:27:00.92 --> 02:27:11.88
so it was fun we get into this and there's a lot of connections here top gun couldn't

1946
02:27:11.88 --> 02:27:16.68
avoid a rival with the US Air Force there wasn't about politics to us it was about flying

1947
02:27:16.68 --> 02:27:21.16
and ideas sure it bothered us to hear the Air Force claim it had created the first

1948
02:27:21.16 --> 02:27:28.20
fighter weapon school it's bad ideas that lose wars and get people killed the most vocal

1949
02:27:28.20 --> 02:27:33.80
advocate of the Air Force thinking at that time was major John Boyd in 1969 he was making a lot of

1950
02:27:33.80 --> 02:27:39.80
speeches promoting his energy maneuverability theory of air to air warfare simply put it's a

1951
02:27:39.80 --> 02:27:45.000
mathematical formula that tries to reduce fighter aircraft performance to a single value based on

1952
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:53.08
the plane speed thrust aerodynamic drag and weight first put forward in 1964 it had reportedly been

1953
02:27:53.08 --> 02:27:59.88
used by the Air Force to design new fighters such as the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 fighting Falcon

1954
02:27:59.88 --> 02:28:07.24
outstanding planes as we all know in 1969 Mel and Skye gave a talk at Tindle Air Force base in

1955
02:28:07.24 --> 02:28:13.88
Florida John Boyd followed them pitching his theory there was some good debate and Mel remembers

1956
02:28:13.88 --> 02:28:20.76
Air Force officers starting to challenge their catacysm in the Q&A major Boyd made an infamous

1957
02:28:20.76 --> 02:28:28.36
remark he said that no US pilot should ever dogfight a MIG because his theory proved mathematically

1958
02:28:28.36 --> 02:28:34.04
that since the enemy plane performed better throughout the flight envelope than the F-4 taking on

1959
02:28:34.04 --> 02:28:40.12
a MIG was a good way to end up hanging from a parachute or a whole lot worse the problem with any

1960
02:28:40.12 --> 02:28:46.52
theory is the baggage of its assumptions we thought major Boyd was making some rather large ones

1961
02:28:46.52 --> 02:28:53.40
and considered his analysis suspect as a result in the base auditorium Tindle at Tindle that day

1962
02:28:53.40 --> 02:28:59.80
Skye poked Mel in the ribs why don't you say something rattleer Mel stood up and proposed to the

1963
02:28:59.80 --> 02:29:07.32
Air Force officer that he was underrating a few things namely people Mel said that while weapons

1964
02:29:07.32 --> 02:29:15.000
might have parameters and airplanes theoretical values no algorithm could predict much if it excluded

1965
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:22.28
the most important factor of all the skill, heart and drive of the pilot in the cockpit.

1966
02:29:23.24 --> 02:29:29.40
The moment of truth was the merge it was then that you had your chance to take the measure of a man.

1967
02:29:30.44 --> 02:29:36.76
Sir Mel said I just don't think you know anything you can know anything about another pilot before

1968
02:29:36.76 --> 02:29:42.84
the first turn and if you don't know that then you can't say that a MIG 17 will win every time

1969
02:29:42.84 --> 02:29:50.28
that needed saying the best I can recall major Boyd didn't really engage you replied by restating

1970
02:29:50.28 --> 02:29:56.28
his claim thank you for that view lieutenant but you can't fight a MIG in an F4 will lose wars that way

1971
02:29:57.32 --> 02:30:02.84
we would see about that John Boyd was an intelligent patriotic and good at a great many things

1972
02:30:02.84 --> 02:30:09.24
from this exchange we concluded that one of them was deriving big ideas that aspired to university

1973
02:30:09.24 --> 02:30:15.64
but did not reckon with the human heart an aerial combat technical factors were important

1974
02:30:16.20 --> 02:30:22.60
some of them could be modeled but no model could tell the whole story major Boyd was not wrong his

1975
02:30:22.60 --> 02:30:29.08
theory was simply incomplete he also completely misjudged the F4 there were no slouches at science

1976
02:30:29.08 --> 02:30:37.32
either we were no slouches at science either with cobra ruffleson's technical acuity and hard work

1977
02:30:37.32 --> 02:30:44.36
we had fused hard data with equally hard experience it ended up showing exactly how a

1978
02:30:44.36 --> 02:30:51.000
fandom could smoke a MIG almost every time the energy maneuverability theory had little to say about

1979
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:56.36
tactics or the people who made them work the pilot is a key part of the equation though it as a

1980
02:30:56.36 --> 02:31:01.72
though as a variable it cannot be quantified out of mirror maras students and instructors bent the

1981
02:31:01.72 --> 02:31:06.36
jet and flew beyond the limits we were trying to turn the man in the cockpit into a weapon

1982
02:31:06.36 --> 02:31:12.36
as adversary pilots melski co-branash and i were enjoying the role flying debriefing the

1983
02:31:12.36 --> 02:31:17.48
adjusting from the enemy point of view day after day flight after flight we were helping our

1984
02:31:17.48 --> 02:31:26.36
students meet the challenge we were making them part of the equation and i got to say one last

1985
02:31:26.36 --> 02:31:31.72
thing adherence to strict rules and restrictions meant almost certain defeat against well-trained

1986
02:31:31.72 --> 02:31:39.32
pilots fighting under no such restrictions and this is why we at top gun never existed before we

1987
02:31:39.32 --> 02:31:45.08
we at top gun we say top gun never existed before the navy set it up at Miramar no schoolhouse that

1988
02:31:45.08 --> 02:31:51.88
required adherence to fixed ideas reduced airplanes to numbers or considered its instructors as

1989
02:31:51.88 --> 02:31:59.56
priests could ever be top gun in our book from the final tallies over in Vietnam we would eventually

1990
02:31:59.56 --> 02:32:10.04
learn to tell the tale you know what we ended up from the day top gun it started in the first class

1991
02:32:10.04 --> 02:32:20.44
graduated to the end of the Vietnam war kill ratio went from 2 to 1 to 24 to 1 it works

1992
02:32:20.44 --> 02:32:30.76
since the key elements you age is no criteria for knowledge the young ones are as good

1993
02:32:31.72 --> 02:32:38.36
if not better because the energy level 8 possess if they're willing to study and learn

1994
02:32:38.36 --> 02:32:45.000
the young ones are the reason you know i look at this youngster here it's hard to believe you've been

1995
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:56.68
that that route but and look as young as you do but we broke with tradition the only reason

1996
02:32:56.68 --> 02:33:04.52
he Air Force until after top gun got up and going they had Air Force fighter weapons school

1997
02:33:04.52 --> 02:33:13.48
it knows for years gunnery and a few things but never in any like top gun now they have a red flag

1998
02:33:13.48 --> 02:33:21.40
and the reason was the three star that they had run and things during Vietnam retired

1999
02:33:22.52 --> 02:33:32.60
one guy held them back he mandated the flying wings thing spent time with robin holes

2000
02:33:32.60 --> 02:33:41.56
you know the great general there's a guy i is a guy i lies talked to the links with robin holes

2001
02:33:41.56 --> 02:33:48.84
and football games with them and and brought him down to fly with a smear mark on the Friday

2002
02:33:49.48 --> 02:33:57.64
had a super happy hour that night with him and and uh and uh i watch his career in

2003
02:33:58.44 --> 02:34:07.16
because of the mandated things the Air Force wouldn't change we never criticized them we didn't do anything

2004
02:34:07.16 --> 02:34:15.000
they had a well i learned a lot about them at the dream land when we were flying a dream

2005
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.60
land with the Air Force guys there were four or five guys up there we've good it's anybody i

2006
02:34:20.60 --> 02:34:29.08
had but they were under the restriction of of an old timer old timer probably out of Washington

2007
02:34:29.08 --> 02:34:37.56
who would come out and when he retired the Air Force jumped on red flag and they are good now let me

2008
02:34:37.56 --> 02:34:46.52
tie it there is good as anybody so you know as you were just kind of alluding to we get into

2009
02:34:47.16 --> 02:34:57.88
what you title in the book proof of concept which is the guys are going to war and uh you you say

2010
02:34:57.88 --> 02:35:04.84
here top gun students became crisp smart quick deadly and confident they knew the performance

2011
02:35:04.84 --> 02:35:08.68
envelopes of their airplanes and missiles maneuver quickly to exploit them and handled

2012
02:35:09.40 --> 02:35:14.76
all the switch interfaces in the cockpit efficiently they demonstrated their ability to fly the

2013
02:35:14.76 --> 02:35:22.44
egg tactics to perfection and use the high yo yo out of a two plane loose douce formation

2014
02:35:22.44 --> 02:35:28.52
to fill a and fry a grass or pilots almost every time out their final exam was a special

2015
02:35:28.52 --> 02:35:35.16
retreat and unrestricted sparrow inside wind or shoot against live maneuvering targets

2016
02:35:37.24 --> 02:35:44.20
that was Steve Smith we took him up to the civic missile range and took a BQM 34

2017
02:35:45.48 --> 02:35:51.08
which you know the good old American way would straighten leveled like shooting down an airline

2018
02:35:51.08 --> 02:35:59.72
or and we found out that this damn BQM would out gee the airplanes particularly when it's

2019
02:35:59.72 --> 02:36:07.64
controlled on the ground so I put Steve Smith one of my originals put him down on the ground

2020
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:15.08
controlling and that damn missile come out and then dogfight him and Jerry Boo yeah the first

2021
02:36:15.08 --> 02:36:25.80
first student grad shot it down first time out give us a little history on the patch the top gun patch

2022
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:37.64
I don't you know we we could take every night before and after we started working students

2023
02:36:37.64 --> 02:36:45.72
at the club we just go and sometimes have beer to and I could take today's effort so the

2024
02:36:47.08 --> 02:36:56.84
the the patch was designed at the old club by two of the guys Steve Smith could do anything

2025
02:36:56.84 --> 02:37:04.68
I mean these guys are we should see where they are today in business but Steve and in millholzed

2026
02:37:04.68 --> 02:37:15.96
signed a patch and we submitted it incidentally I never asked for permission ever in a front end

2027
02:37:15.96 --> 02:37:24.68
of what we were doing no permission no letters of approval everything you know if we if they don't

2028
02:37:24.68 --> 02:37:33.80
like the telltale's never had to get anything ask above me and it was it wasn't me it was nine of us

2029
02:37:35.24 --> 02:37:40.84
the key elements what I talked about each guy bringing something special table there would not

2030
02:37:41.48 --> 02:37:49.16
she didn't like this but I do there would not have been a top gun had any of the nine guys not

2031
02:37:49.16 --> 02:37:56.20
been available now maybe I don't know what you what your religion is or what you believe

2032
02:37:57.48 --> 02:38:05.48
but millon I and a few of the guys sit down to our day and realize this and how we all got it together

2033
02:38:05.48 --> 02:38:13.48
how all nine of us ended up in a group pretty much has to do with some higher power help yeah

2034
02:38:13.48 --> 02:38:20.28
higher rank in and it worked and being young you know you could always say me a couple of

2035
02:38:20.28 --> 02:38:30.28
then I don't know that he did nobody ever got us go ahead yeah that's that's uh and that the fact

2036
02:38:30.28 --> 02:38:38.36
that the top gun patches are made in the sights yeah it's sort of kind of offensive right to

2037
02:38:38.36 --> 02:38:44.68
if you're if you're a fifth year a Russian and it was and to make 21 and some many

2038
02:38:44.68 --> 02:38:51.32
Washington said when we submitted it the guys were wearing her on the fleets Steve had a

2039
02:38:51.32 --> 02:38:58.68
maid somewhere in the PI and made him for us quick so we're all wearing these patches you know

2040
02:38:58.68 --> 02:39:06.68
top gun man mood like that and some many Washington called out and said we're gonna have a

2041
02:39:06.68 --> 02:39:15.64
sponsored state department and I called my I call my bulletproof jacket who's a three star

2042
02:39:15.64 --> 02:39:23.56
animal at airpack bush brungle nice and move bush brungle and when I took the job

2043
02:39:23.56 --> 02:39:28.84
this is kind of off the record I took the job I talked to him because I'd work for him and

2044
02:39:28.84 --> 02:39:37.48
I liked him and he liked me and I just said kind of man you talk about loading the thing up in

2045
02:39:37.48 --> 02:39:46.68
the hurry and he said I'll make it bulletproof at a great career I got promoted commander early

2046
02:39:46.68 --> 02:39:54.68
made captain two years early and you know I would end up in shit you know the only reason

2047
02:39:54.68 --> 02:40:04.04
I'd get torpedoed along the way was bringle bringle was tough boy general quiet all man

2048
02:40:04.04 --> 02:40:12.20
but night he predicted me in the patch he made one phone call and oh we like our patch

2049
02:40:13.88 --> 02:40:18.28
so there's your answer you know one thing I want to jump through real quick as you mentioned

2050
02:40:18.28 --> 02:40:26.12
a couple times the the fault the traits that you guys were you know putting forward as what a good

2051
02:40:26.12 --> 02:40:32.44
pilot consists of you say a passion for the mission necessary to sustain the individual in

2052
02:40:32.44 --> 02:40:38.12
an extreme environment leadership by personal example a compassionate inspirational person

2053
02:40:38.12 --> 02:40:45.56
willing to take responsibility extraordinary airmanship required to operate in so unforgiving

2054
02:40:45.56 --> 02:40:51.96
and environment humility derived from a sense of being part of something much greater than one

2055
02:40:51.96 --> 02:41:00.28
self subject matter expertise that is beyond reproach a work ethic that will drive the person to do

2056
02:41:00.28 --> 02:41:08.68
whatever it takes for however long it takes to ensure success personal discipline to endure

2057
02:41:08.68 --> 02:41:14.20
the rigorous training and attention to detail required to constantly perform at an optimum level

2058
02:41:14.20 --> 02:41:20.44
integrity adaptability innovation and a willingness to challenge the status quo

2059
02:41:21.96 --> 02:41:28.20
and last credibility established through demonstrated performance sustained over time

2060
02:41:29.96 --> 02:41:35.40
now the only thing I don't like about those is it took me I think four or five books that I've written

2061
02:41:35.40 --> 02:41:41.16
that are thousands of words each to to explain what you just did a few it a few sentences it took

2062
02:41:41.16 --> 02:41:50.92
me it took me three years with the help of two other guys to define and we were we were

2063
02:41:53.96 --> 02:42:02.44
in a long time ago those were written we never put them in a legacy book document like this

2064
02:42:02.44 --> 02:42:09.000
for the 15th anniversary but it took a three years to find and the reason being is top gun

2065
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:18.04
with so successful after the first half dozen classes we weren't going to get torpedoed anywhere

2066
02:42:18.04 --> 02:42:25.72
there were guys begging to get in and we had to have selection criteria and you got one of them

2067
02:42:26.52 --> 02:42:34.84
and they still use those criteria in the selection and the instructors I'm not sure the guys

2068
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:41.56
know what they're getting into because the work load is crazy how hard they were from now

2069
02:42:43.16 --> 02:42:47.80
well obviously it's a high standard and there's a reason for it like you said earlier

2070
02:42:47.80 --> 02:42:56.12
you got people's lives in your hands that's right and you're right and besides that right now

2071
02:42:56.12 --> 02:43:05.48
and I don't know how you feel David but they're still even in the beginning they were the best

2072
02:43:05.48 --> 02:43:14.92
the best and they kept that alive for 50 years that's why the book was written it's celebrating

2073
02:43:14.92 --> 02:43:25.08
the legacy and putting it running and then like this 50 years of trying to live by those criteria

2074
02:43:25.08 --> 02:43:30.12
in a selection because like this and it's worked and they're proud of it

2075
02:43:31.48 --> 02:43:43.96
42 CEOs and about 600 instructors small group and at time 50 years go ahead please

2076
02:43:47.48 --> 02:43:53.64
again this we're getting into a section now that's that's talking about the proof of concept

2077
02:43:53.64 --> 02:43:59.48
because now the guys are at war as I was saying and we get to here on Saturday March 28th

2078
02:43:59.48 --> 02:44:06.12
Jerry and his Rios Steve Barkley were idling their F4J standing on the catapult in a

2079
02:44:06.12 --> 02:44:11.32
alert five status ready for quick launch when the radar control ship reported four bandits

2080
02:44:11.32 --> 02:44:16.92
inbound toward the carrier that afternoon bollier and his air wing commander Paul Spear were launched

2081
02:44:16.92 --> 02:44:22.28
off the constellations deck as the radar calls kept coming and the range closed they saw no

2082
02:44:22.28 --> 02:44:27.40
sign of the mix the fanom pair pressed ahead it was bullier who first sighted the enemy fighters

2083
02:44:27.40 --> 02:44:34.84
ahead and above him at about 25,000 feet following the loose doos doctrine Jerry alerted spear

2084
02:44:34.84 --> 02:44:41.96
and took lead stoking his afterburners and accelerating into a climbing turn to intercept the two

2085
02:44:41.96 --> 02:44:46.76
mixed spotted the Americans and separated the leader climbing and his wingman Blake breaking into a

2086
02:44:46.76 --> 02:44:54.12
right turn bollier took the enemy wingman while Spear went after the leader as he closed with the

2087
02:44:54.12 --> 02:45:00.12
number two mid bollier realized I suspect in the space of those first 20 seconds that his excitement

2088
02:45:00.12 --> 02:45:04.92
had led him to stray from the proper technique he was fighting in the horizontal and climbing

2089
02:45:04.92 --> 02:45:10.04
to engage his enemy directly he had lost too much airspeed to attack effectively he dove again

2090
02:45:10.04 --> 02:45:15.88
to regain it pulling seven gs at the bottom he found the mid descending with him looking to avoid

2091
02:45:15.88 --> 02:45:21.16
a turning fight he returned to what we had taught him he pulled up sharply sharply to initiate

2092
02:45:21.16 --> 02:45:27.80
the egg maneuver rocketing vertically the mig had no chance to keep up meanwhile down below

2093
02:45:27.80 --> 02:45:34.76
commander Spear had seemed to unnerve his own mig its pilot turned wide and left the fight

2094
02:45:34.76 --> 02:45:41.88
Spear was turning back toward bollier to clear Jerry's tail when Jerry when Jerry's mig saw Spear

2095
02:45:41.88 --> 02:45:48.04
the north Vietnamese pilot fired a heat seeking a toll missile at the approaching phantom

2096
02:45:48.44 --> 02:45:53.64
the head shot the head on shot missed up and up bulliers phantom went with real

2097
02:45:53.64 --> 02:45:58.68
barcly keeping him oriented telling him that the mig shooting at Spear was no threat Jerry

2098
02:45:58.68 --> 02:46:03.48
focused on setting up his shot arcing over the top he saw that their opponent was vulnerable

2099
02:46:03.48 --> 02:46:08.84
the mig had lost sight of him the enemy pilot banked right and then reversed sharply left

2100
02:46:08.84 --> 02:46:15.32
as if looking for his pursuer this last maneuver was a fatal mistake it gave Jerry a clean shot

2101
02:46:15.32 --> 02:46:21.64
up the enemy's tailpipe with the tone of a sidewinder lock buzzing in his helmet earphones

2102
02:46:21.64 --> 02:46:27.24
he pressed the trigger and his missile left the rail it tracked true and exploded underneath the

2103
02:46:27.24 --> 02:46:34.04
mig a shower of steel fragments sliced into the enemy plane and set it on fire trailing flames

2104
02:46:34.04 --> 02:46:40.44
like a torch the mig sailed along rocking its wings bollier pulled up sharply to avoid running

2105
02:46:40.44 --> 02:46:46.04
past him slid in behind him again and fired another missile this one finished him just like he had

2106
02:46:46.04 --> 02:46:52.20
done in the drone shoot at top gun back on the deck of the constellation the celebration started

2107
02:46:52.20 --> 02:46:59.16
immediately Paul Spear a large man gave diminutive Jerry a bear hug and lifted him off the top

2108
02:46:59.16 --> 02:47:05.56
of his feet champagne strictly forbidden floed later that day a hanoi radio broadcast from the

2109
02:47:05.56 --> 02:47:11.88
mig locked uh confirmed the mig loss in Washington the politics of peace talks forced the

2110
02:47:11.88 --> 02:47:17.000
Pentagon to make smoke other than a brief announcement of a mig being downed the kill was said to have

2111
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.68
been scored by fanombs that were escorting a photo reconnaissance aircraft the navy kept a lid

2112
02:47:22.68 --> 02:47:28.60
on the story back at Miramar we wondered who the mig killer was when it was finally confirmed that

2113
02:47:28.60 --> 02:47:34.84
the mig killers were bowlier and barcly we were ecstatic it validated not only what we talk

2114
02:47:35.48 --> 02:47:46.92
what not only what we taught but our schools very existence pretty awesome did you guys

2115
02:47:46.92 --> 02:47:59.40
have any beverages when you found out that oh yeah yeah there's a lot of work getting to that

2116
02:47:59.40 --> 02:48:07.80
point and there are a lot of people you have no idea juggle what the opposition was like but it was

2117
02:48:07.80 --> 02:48:16.44
the same we're young we're doing the best we can that's waiting to see and man when the when the kill

2118
02:48:16.44 --> 02:48:26.12
started happening the word started we went from having to work hard to get people to come to the

2119
02:48:26.12 --> 02:48:38.68
school like we did before we initiated to where Steve Smith had loved same guys he'd say I'm sorry

2120
02:48:38.68 --> 02:48:45.08
were full up for six months but I'll put you in the waiting list for next year he's ghost

2121
02:48:47.08 --> 02:48:53.80
he's ghost guys you know they're too close to Washington they gave us a fit in the beginning

2122
02:48:53.80 --> 02:49:01.80
fast forward in January 1972 captain Smith cut the order top gun became a permanent

2123
02:49:01.80 --> 02:49:07.40
detachment appearing in the rag organizational chart with a solid line instead of a dotted line

2124
02:49:07.40 --> 02:49:12.84
connecting it to chicksmith's headquarters that little tweak to the org chart made all the

2125
02:49:12.84 --> 02:49:17.72
different suddenly we were assured of adequate staffing equipment fuel and operating funds

2126
02:49:17.72 --> 02:49:29.48
our program is free of its former parent organization and then it goes top gun goes to war

2127
02:49:31.64 --> 02:49:38.12
yanky station 1972 on March 30th 30,000 north Vietnamese army soldiers supported by a hundred tanks

2128
02:49:38.12 --> 02:49:43.88
acquired from red china invaded south Vietnam a few days later another 20,000 troops also supported

2129
02:49:43.88 --> 02:49:49.64
by tanks struck south Vietnam from louse they were the vanguard of a communist army that would

2130
02:49:49.64 --> 02:49:55.32
ultimately field 300,000 troops and 600 armored vehicles on May 10th

2131
02:49:56.60 --> 02:50:01.80
present Nixon ordered the mining of high fong harbor and other Japanese or another north Vietnamese

2132
02:50:01.80 --> 02:50:07.80
ports putting a stop to Soviet deliveries of migs and surface to air missiles meanwhile air force

2133
02:50:07.80 --> 02:50:12.76
Marine Corps navy planes hammered north Vietnamese supply lines bridges collapsed under a

2134
02:50:12.76 --> 02:50:17.88
barrage of first generation smart weapons including laser guided bombs delivered by navy

2135
02:50:17.88 --> 02:50:25.40
grum and a six intruders in a seven course air twos air force b 52 strato forces strato fortresses

2136
02:50:25.40 --> 02:50:30.12
struck mega airfields around hanoi the enemy tried to defend these important targets

2137
02:50:30.12 --> 02:50:35.40
flying make 21 and make 19 interceptors the north Vietnamese pilots found themselves in wild

2138
02:50:35.40 --> 02:50:41.72
dog fights with US air force fanom's on May 10th 3,000,000,000,000 went down to air to air missiles

2139
02:50:41.72 --> 02:50:48.12
but the north Vietnamese pilots scored two kills the air force continued to use old style

2140
02:50:48.12 --> 02:50:54.84
world war two air tactics that we found so limiting the navy was on a different path

2141
02:50:54.84 --> 02:51:00.44
the north Vietnamese makes encountered a new navy the alpha strikes included electronic countermeasure

2142
02:51:00.44 --> 02:51:06.84
aircraft that jam the radio frequencies of the north Vietnamese pilots they ran into top gun trained

2143
02:51:06.84 --> 02:51:17.08
pilots the tactics we developed at Miramar changed the game altogether and look this there's a

2144
02:51:17.08 --> 02:51:21.40
section of the book that i'm not going to read right now because people just need to get the

2145
02:51:21.40 --> 02:51:26.60
book and read it but you go into some of these incredible dog fights the tactics are being used

2146
02:51:26.60 --> 02:51:35.24
they're being executed and victory after victory is being chalked up and you get to hear by mid-June

2147
02:51:35.24 --> 02:51:42.92
the navy's kill ratio during linebacker stood at almost 12 to one a 600% increase over what

2148
02:51:42.92 --> 02:51:47.64
we had managed during rolling thunder the navy's high command was ecstatic the north Vietnamese

2149
02:51:47.64 --> 02:51:53.72
air force was clearly demoralized that spring a make 17 pilot encountered a navy f4 and ejected

2150
02:51:53.72 --> 02:51:59.64
on the spot before he even came under fire they had no answer for our new tactics and teamwork

2151
02:51:59.64 --> 02:52:06.28
by the summer of 1972 the migs focused on attacking the air force while avoiding U.S. flights

2152
02:52:06.28 --> 02:52:11.80
originating from Yankee station are mig hungry top gun grads didn't like it but the tactical

2153
02:52:11.80 --> 02:52:17.56
switch provided stark testimony to which service they thought they could score against sadly the

2154
02:52:17.56 --> 02:52:24.44
air force fought the 1972 air campaign essentially as it had rolling thunder and here in

2155
02:52:24.44 --> 02:52:31.48
into the fluid for formation cost them air crews of the 51 aircraft that the air force lost during

2156
02:52:31.48 --> 02:52:38.12
operation linebacker 22 went down to guns and missiles of north Vietnamese migs during the same time

2157
02:52:38.12 --> 02:52:44.68
the navy lost just four birds to migs the Marines lost an f4 phantom to a mig and scored one in return

2158
02:52:45.72 --> 02:52:50.44
from the start date of the top gun program to the end of the war the navy's overall kill ratio

2159
02:52:50.44 --> 02:53:05.40
was 24 to 1 i mean that's just transformational transformational efforts on your part the rest

2160
02:53:05.40 --> 02:53:12.20
of the top gun team the navy captain all for putting that report together the chain of command

2161
02:53:12.20 --> 02:53:21.72
for actually listening and enacting these things it's a incredible history it was a good start

2162
02:53:21.72 --> 02:53:32.44
and the big thing is the book represents 50 years we wanted in writing never been written before

2163
02:53:32.44 --> 02:53:41.64
wanted in writing the legacy of how it got started and where really it's powerful it's a

2164
02:53:41.64 --> 02:53:53.40
problem or other volumes that could be written from this goes out into the 70s 85 probably the last

2165
02:53:54.44 --> 02:54:05.16
in this book you guys digs red butter all these guys over 50 years they were in the

2166
02:54:05.16 --> 02:54:15.32
they were in the opposition and they fought their way through it we gave all their planes

2167
02:54:15.32 --> 02:54:21.88
amongst mcun who was the co number four and it up giving me his rallies all they have a

2168
02:54:21.88 --> 02:54:29.40
carrier plates during one of their when their fiasco's over in his room all their planes were

2169
02:54:29.40 --> 02:54:37.16
given away and they they stole some newer plates he cut their hands on some it's never been

2170
02:54:39.72 --> 02:54:46.76
and the only downside was the mood to fall in at the time wasn't very well received i mean

2171
02:54:47.40 --> 02:54:53.000
you imagine on your home in beautiful sandier having your kids go to school here

2172
02:54:53.000 --> 02:55:02.04
taking your college graduate wives and say let's unload it all we're going up to the moon to live

2173
02:55:02.92 --> 02:55:09.72
and i'm just a god it's really a sad story they get up there and they found some some

2174
02:55:11.32 --> 02:55:19.32
some bad things up there and and then the other thing was the opposition within the navy and i'm

2175
02:55:19.32 --> 02:55:28.52
speaking personally now was all has always been apparent by that it used to be fighter pilots

2176
02:55:28.52 --> 02:55:35.72
and attack pilots and attack pilots after the movie came out after Tom Cruise first movie

2177
02:55:35.72 --> 02:55:43.56
shit boy they were all over it's they didn't like that one bit and the guys guys fought their way

2178
02:55:43.56 --> 02:55:53.88
through it 42 seals in order anyhow that's another well obviously got more books in yeah

2179
02:55:55.24 --> 02:55:59.96
got a lot more books i got one got one work

2180
02:56:02.04 --> 02:56:11.32
meanwhile this is an over yet you know you you say here home with my family for a rare Friday night

2181
02:56:11.32 --> 02:56:15.64
this is 1973 hours barbeque mistakes thinking about taking an after dinner swim with the kids

2182
02:56:15.64 --> 02:56:20.12
when the phone rang i went to pick it up sensing something was wrong as it turned out i was right

2183
02:56:20.12 --> 02:56:25.40
the executive officer of fighter squadron 143 the pukenedogs was missing an action in south

2184
02:56:25.40 --> 02:56:31.64
Vietnam that pilot hardly haul was a friend of mine the squadron was in a state of shock

2185
02:56:31.64 --> 02:56:37.40
it also needed a new exo which accounted for my emergency orders to pack up within 20 hours and

2186
02:56:37.40 --> 02:56:46.12
begin the long journey out to the enterprise you've been there you guys have seen that i'm sure

2187
02:56:47.32 --> 02:56:55.80
yeah i mean uh the it's what we sign up for but it doesn't make it easy it's harder and the family

2188
02:56:55.80 --> 02:57:06.04
anybody you know you show up 24 hours later a navy sea two took me aboard at

2189
02:57:06.04 --> 02:57:11.88
qb point foome out to the carrier the squadron seal gordon cornell met me on the flight deck gordo

2190
02:57:11.88 --> 02:57:17.40
was a warrior's warrior a man who'd flown everything from f9 f panthers to f eight crusaders

2191
02:57:17.40 --> 02:57:23.000
and f four phanams wounded an action over north Vietnam in 1966 he went on to earn two distinguished

2192
02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:28.68
flying crosses and seventeen air metals really got glad to see you yank sorry it had to be

2193
02:57:28.68 --> 02:57:34.60
under such terrible circumstances i shook his hand and asked how the dogs were doing their dogs

2194
02:57:34.60 --> 02:57:41.32
down they'll always be okay their tough bunch bonded as Harley would have wanted still clutching

2195
02:57:41.32 --> 02:57:49.000
my hand he seemed to reconsider this he added their herding badly some of the guys can't wait to get home

2196
02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:55.08
and help out Mary Lou and the kids there was sadness in his eyes the shooting war was over

2197
02:57:55.08 --> 02:58:02.52
but we all had wounds to heal as twenty minutes before the armances became effective

2198
02:58:02.52 --> 02:58:12.04
the whole the an armor

2199
02:58:12.04 --> 02:58:16.20
every fighter pilot wants a command of his own squadron i learned i was to become the

2200
02:58:16.20 --> 02:58:22.52
skipper of the pukendogs again i'm fast boarding at at this point at i'm gonna jump to a part

2201
02:58:22.52 --> 02:58:29.08
where you're heading to Las Vegas at the end of August for an enormous reunion of american

2202
02:58:29.08 --> 02:58:34.52
aviators of all services who had phoned in Vietnam we would unofficially welcome back the 166 men

2203
02:58:34.52 --> 02:58:39.88
taken prisoner by the north Vietnamese some three thousand of us and our wives gathered at the

2204
02:58:39.88 --> 02:58:44.76
hilton there were many spontaneous many reunions that night as old friend saw each other for the first

2205
02:58:44.76 --> 02:58:50.04
time and years the happiness touched everyone the war over the years of hardship and rear view mirror

2206
02:58:50.04 --> 02:58:56.20
at last our former POWs were ready to pick up their lives and careers what an enormous challenge

2207
02:58:56.20 --> 02:59:01.32
some came home knowing nothing of the summer of love the wats riots the ken state shootings

2208
02:59:01.32 --> 02:59:06.84
or the assassinations of martin Luther King and robbered fkennity the last experience of america

2209
02:59:06.84 --> 02:59:12.44
predated acid rock and woodstock fitting into the here and now and getting to know their

2210
02:59:12.44 --> 02:59:19.96
families again tested the former POWs all over again and you and i were talking about Charlie

but you know both those guys captured suffered immeasurable and came home and carried on with their lives

2214
02:59:41.64 --> 02:59:52.28

day in the sealed teams we would deploy with our maritime equipment some of that maritime equipment

2243
03:03:40.44 --> 03:03:50.28
is 55 horsepower engines and we were in our couple tunes we were deploying on a ship and when i was

2244
03:03:50.28 --> 03:03:55.24
reading what you were writing about the aircraft you got their own personalities and you what you

2245
03:03:55.24 --> 03:03:59.48
and the exact same thing happened we came home from one deployment and they said hey we're going to

2246
03:03:59.48 --> 03:04:02.68

2250
03:04:18.60 --> 03:04:24.92
they all had names and he knew him he knew him and rather than get brand new engines he said no

2251
03:04:24.92 --> 03:04:31.16
i want these engines i want the same engines and the caveatie golf just like okay you want these

2252

2258
03:05:20.52 --> 03:05:28.68
he knew everything to do with a warner and some missiles on the air plane and uh and he

2259
03:05:28.68 --> 03:05:36.28
held a new it all stand on his head he was that good but big talk good looking guy personality

2260
03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:43.64

2261
03:05:43.64 --> 03:05:50.68

2263
03:05:58.68 --> 03:06:05.40
talking to me and i said gunner how did you end up here and he said i was

2264
03:06:05.40 --> 03:06:15.64
inserted in northean um and uh i think the guy with him was killed and there were two of

2265
03:06:15.64 --> 03:06:21.24
men there and they were going to put it i think they had a mission to take care of something in there

2266
03:06:22.28 --> 03:06:33.24
nicely said okay and he said i lost my partner and i got in a river and i'm floating out

2267
03:06:33.24 --> 03:06:44.12
floating out the river ran to the ocean and he said i was floating down this river with

2268
03:06:44.12 --> 03:06:51.88
looking for him along the banks in the air and there and people yelling and he said the only thing

2269
03:06:51.88 --> 03:06:59.40
i'm gonna tell you is he says i felt this warm thing wrap around me you know what it was

2270
03:06:59.40 --> 03:07:07.96
some guy named big sea snake wrapped around him you guys you know what that's like i read about them

2271
03:07:07.96 --> 03:07:20.76
and he said he took out he took out his knife and he got the snake said oh and he said i

2272
03:07:20.76 --> 03:07:27.72
floated out and he said but he said when i when i got out they picked me up he said

2273
03:07:27.72 --> 03:07:37.80
i never could quit dreaming about that day i'm gonna snake and so anyhow i said he said well

2274
03:07:37.80 --> 03:07:42.60
he said didn't want me back and Vietnam anymore they wanted to give my rest i think

2275
03:07:43.40 --> 03:07:49.08
yeah after a lot of things yeah after Vietnam there's a whole group of seals when they

2276
03:07:49.08 --> 03:07:55.32
downside this downside is the seal teams there was a whole group of seals that they sent to the

2277
03:07:55.32 --> 03:07:59.08
fleet and also it might have been because he was a warnafter because i don't know if they knew

2278
03:07:59.08 --> 03:08:04.20
what to do with the warnafters back then in the inside the seal teams and they might have said oh you

2279
03:08:04.20 --> 03:08:09.08
made a warnafter congratulations you're gonna go be a warnafter in the fleet could have been

2280
03:08:09.08 --> 03:08:15.48
either one of those things uh if any of your listeners should know the worry about the warnafter

2281
03:08:15.48 --> 03:08:25.08
bobcane no calling bobby and uh he was remarkable in his capacity as my gunner for two

2282
03:08:25.08 --> 03:08:33.24
cruises and uh wrote to him for a couple years and lots of tight cuddling i think in pomey maybe

2283
03:08:33.24 --> 03:08:40.20
still alive but i just love it if somebody you hold them and let you know so you could tell me

2284
03:08:40.20 --> 03:08:45.56
certainly if somebody knows and there's a lot of guys that listen to this so they'll get the word out

2285
03:08:45.56 --> 03:09:02.12
and try and find uh warnafter bobby king find out where he's at yeah the um you you go into a great

2286
03:09:03.08 --> 03:09:12.36
kind of detailed account of of the Israeli war and how you know you you already mentioned how

2287
03:09:12.36 --> 03:09:21.16
uh how we were able to help out how top gun specifically was able to help out and and also the efforts

2288
03:09:21.16 --> 03:09:26.44
of of the guys and the Israeli you know air force is that what is the Israeli air force?

2289
03:09:26.44 --> 03:09:33.32
oh yeah those two gentlemen that i speak of in the book both went on to be

2290
03:09:34.44 --> 03:09:40.28
commanding generalcy is really air force one of them went on to be the secretary of events in Israel

2291
03:09:40.28 --> 03:09:48.44
and i can't tell you everything i've done with them but uh they are remarkable and you know for years

2292
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:55.72
i think we'd uh started out maybe living in their shadow a little bit whether tactically

2293
03:09:55.72 --> 03:10:06.44
were as good once top gun came out then we're equal and uh but uh when they come in the United

2294
03:10:06.44 --> 03:10:14.36
States on business i'd get a phone call totally illegally get a phone call it's a Daniel

2295
03:10:15.80 --> 03:10:25.96
and he ton he said i'm in Washington if i come out can i fly with you come on so i fly with him in

2296
03:10:25.96 --> 03:10:34.68
the good story is i got my squadron or airway i can't remember but he calls me and he flies into

2297
03:10:34.68 --> 03:10:41.48
you how he got to you man oh but he she ends up in you man and he said you put me on the

2298
03:10:41.48 --> 03:10:50.20
flights against the model yeah yeah so daylight we rolled on the runway two a wingman i got

2299
03:10:50.20 --> 03:10:56.20
a wingman with me and he's got the second section we break the ground he'll have to turn out to go

2300
03:10:56.20 --> 03:11:07.000
over to the range and he's you gotta hear the sky near he's so cool he said Daniel i said the

2301
03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:19.000
out three he said i got a fire and i said is it bad no it's not bad he said i just shut the engine down

2302
03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:28.20
he unloads fuel all over the range makes one perfect turn around lands rolls all around the runway

2303
03:11:29.32 --> 03:11:39.40
and uh by the time the fire truck's got to him he jumped on the first little tractor that was there

2304
03:11:39.96 --> 03:11:47.32
nobody ever knew he was with a pilot was a guy who played that's just a smooth mother

2305
03:11:47.32 --> 03:11:57.08
and boy could he fly got done the pretty good pretty good and uh we did get top gun at one time with

2306
03:11:57.64 --> 03:12:04.28
mug's muckoo and gave my wire planes in order for their survival and that war

2307
03:12:06.92 --> 03:12:12.52
i promise to take Bethlehem to Israel here as soon as we get rid of this lovely

2308
03:12:12.52 --> 03:12:23.48
nightmare in right now guys go for one two long go and back to the book 40 miles off south

2309
03:12:23.48 --> 03:12:30.68
Vietnam April 29th 1975 for naval aviation the problem of Vietnam never seemed to go away

2310
03:12:31.72 --> 03:12:37.96
Lieutenant Darrell Condor Gary stood before the assembled pilots and reels of VF51 in

2311
03:12:37.96 --> 03:12:43.32
Darrell's short career he'd been thrown into the air war over North Vietnam before completing his

2312
03:12:43.32 --> 03:12:49.88
rag training back in the late 1960s as an F4 backseater two tours there and he came home in time

2313
03:12:49.88 --> 03:12:54.12
for me to pull him into top gun as one of our instructors he subsequently went back to flight

2314
03:12:54.12 --> 03:12:58.60
school became an F4 pilot and went through top gun as a student before heading out to the

2315
03:12:59.24 --> 03:13:04.52
carrier USS coral sea and his first overseas deployment as a fighter pilot in 1975

2316
03:13:04.52 --> 03:13:10.92
he was a young lieutenant tasked with delivering one of the most painful briefs the squadron would ever

2317
03:13:10.92 --> 03:13:19.000
receive it fell to Condor to bring them the news that we were abandoning our allies once and for all

2318
03:13:23.40 --> 03:13:31.24
that's the only time I've ever seen him said I would say keg they are erwin commander about this

2319
03:13:31.24 --> 03:13:42.36
guy do it actually when in flu cover over the healing copters and healing copters and

2320
03:13:42.36 --> 03:13:48.76
watch the accident people going out both loads of people trying to get on the carriers and he came

2321
03:13:48.76 --> 03:13:58.84
back and he just he couldn't he just so upset him there's a print of a man you know a lot of times

2322
03:13:58.84 --> 03:14:05.56
I read books while in fact I only read books from people's first persons account of war

2323
03:14:06.92 --> 03:14:11.48
because you know you I want people to understand what it's like to be there

2324
03:14:12.76 --> 03:14:18.68
and one thing that you do in this book that you do very well is the way you connect the guys that are

2325
03:14:18.68 --> 03:14:25.56
there with the overall picture and that's exactly what you did right here because so you've got

2326
03:14:25.56 --> 03:14:31.88
Condor briefing the guys that we're leaving and then you go into this with the last flight to the midway

2327
03:14:31.88 --> 03:14:40.68
from the embassy grounds 1,373 Americans in 5,595 Vietnamese were helicoptered to the naval task force

2328
03:14:40.68 --> 03:14:46.52
another 65,000 fled by boat later to be picked up by one of the 40 ships offshore

2329
03:14:46.52 --> 03:14:56.44
the fixed wing air crowd air lift from Tansong nut pulled out another 50,493 including almost

2330
03:14:56.44 --> 03:15:04.04
2700 orphans they were the lucky ones in the immediate aftermath of South Vietnam's collapse

2331
03:15:04.04 --> 03:15:12.28
more than 150,000 civilians vanished most either executed outright or thrown into concentration camps

2332
03:15:12.28 --> 03:15:19.80
Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City a memorial to the unknown masses of dead somewhere between

2333
03:15:19.80 --> 03:15:27.96
one and four million Vietnamese perished from 1955 to 1975 in Cambodia another 300,000 were killed

2334
03:15:27.96 --> 03:15:33.32
Louseloss between 20 and 60,000 in the years ahead the killing would continue as communist and

2335
03:15:33.32 --> 03:15:39.08
surgeons toppled the governments of Louseloss in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 the

2336
03:15:39.08 --> 03:15:44.12
Commir Rouge a regime that swept to power in the wake of America's exit from the region

2337
03:15:44.12 --> 03:15:50.12
murdered or starve to death about 2.5 million people out of a population of 8 million

2338
03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:57.88
more than 30% of the entire nation when Americans look back at Vietnam we remember the domestic

2339
03:15:57.88 --> 03:16:05.32
unrest we think two of the 58,000 names memorialized on that long black marble wall in Washington

2340
03:16:05.32 --> 03:16:13.40
those are important to remember but few want to discuss the other consequences of America's lost war

2341
03:16:22.36 --> 03:16:29.72
You know there's a lot of connections with a lot of different things and I've been recently talking to a guy

2342
03:16:29.72 --> 03:16:40.68
who's connected to some people that were on this operation when the ship that named the

2343
03:16:40.68 --> 03:16:49.48
My Guest how do you say it? My Guest. The My Guest was captured by the Cambonians and I'm looking

2344
03:16:49.48 --> 03:16:56.12
to get one of these Marines on the podcast to kind of recount what happened so it was very interesting

2345
03:16:56.12 --> 03:17:03.16
to me when I read that you were involved in this so the Cambodians had seized an American flagged

2346
03:17:03.16 --> 03:17:09.16
and owned cargo container ship now the ship was in Camilla Rouge hands and I'm jumping through

2347
03:17:09.16 --> 03:17:13.16
just to hit some of these highlights on the afternoon of the 14th president Gerald Ford ordered

2348
03:17:13.16 --> 03:17:19.96
the seventh Air Force to execute a helicopter assault on Coteang Island and the My Guest

2349
03:17:19.96 --> 03:17:26.12
The forces landing on the island were to find the crew if there were any while another team helicopter

2350
03:17:26.12 --> 03:17:30.84
onto the My Guest and steamed it out in the international waters just before the rescue and in

2351
03:17:30.84 --> 03:17:36.28
Admiral Cougan received a direct call from President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

2352
03:17:36.28 --> 03:17:40.84
I was with him in the coral seas flag headquarters and listened with great interest.

2353
03:17:40.84 --> 03:17:46.44
President Ford ordered the carrier to strike targets on Cambodian mainland including port facilities

2354
03:17:46.44 --> 03:17:53.64
and a nearby naval base, Naval Base. Admiral the president said go get our ship and crew back

2355
03:17:53.64 --> 03:18:01.08
it's your show. Use all available means but no nooks. I wondered how many times our commanders

2356
03:18:01.08 --> 03:18:07.48
on Yankee Station the dirt such a command not even Nixon ever expressed such a clear and

2357
03:18:07.48 --> 03:18:14.44
explicit willingness to let us fight. And so you you know I skipped through this part but you

2358
03:18:14.44 --> 03:18:22.68
were actually there to take over this this squadron. No airway. Airway and the guy that was running

2359
03:18:22.68 --> 03:18:27.32
it said you're gonna have to wait a little bit to listen over. Nobody passes up good combat.

2360
03:18:28.12 --> 03:18:37.40
Excuse me that's portoy support. Yeah. Leadership. Right. Right. The CIA believe that

2361
03:18:37.40 --> 03:18:44.04
content, co-ting was lightly defended if at all in fact more than a hundred commirus troops held

2362
03:18:44.04 --> 03:18:49.24
the island to deter their communist brothers from North Vietnam who had laid claim to these patches

2363
03:18:49.24 --> 03:18:55.64
off the Indo Chinese coast. Armourines rolled into hot landing zones, laced with machine gun

2364
03:18:57.48 --> 03:19:03.32
and rocket propelled grenade fire. From the ship, Darrell watched a several CH53 heavy transport

2365
03:19:03.32 --> 03:19:09.48
helicopters took hits one crashed offshore after receiving two RGB RG RPG hits. The survivors

2366
03:19:09.48 --> 03:19:14.12
were in the water for hours until a gig from one of our escorts pulled them to safety. Including

2367
03:19:14.12 --> 03:19:18.20
those survivors was the Marine Forward Air Controller who somehow found an Air Force survival

2368
03:19:18.20 --> 03:19:23.56
radio that he used to call targets for the eight seven course airs overhead, clinging to records.

2369
03:19:23.56 --> 03:19:27.96
The radio's battery slowly failing. He gave everything he had to try and secure help for the

2370
03:19:27.96 --> 03:19:33.88
embattled Marines pinned down in the landing zone. Three CH53 Jolly Green Giants went down during

2371
03:19:33.88 --> 03:19:39.88
the rescue operation. Fifteen Marines were killed on Co-Tang and 50 more wounded during the fire

2372
03:19:39.88 --> 03:19:45.24
the fighting that rage throughout the day. Meanwhile our attacker crafts saturated the myugas

2373
03:19:45.24 --> 03:19:49.80
with tear gas and American warship racing to the anchorage with a company of Marines aboard

2374
03:19:49.80 --> 03:19:54.36
an hour later the assault after an hour after the assault in the island began the Marines

2375
03:19:54.36 --> 03:19:59.56
clad and gas masks swarmed the cargo of the ship and founded abandoned. We had our ship back but

2376
03:19:59.56 --> 03:20:04.52
where was the crew. The comir had released them sending them back out to see who are navy patrol

2377
03:20:04.52 --> 03:20:09.56
planes spotted them. Another American warship steam to the vessel pulled the crew aboard just

2378
03:20:09.56 --> 03:20:14.36
before the lunch hour. The final act played out through the afternoon as the Air Force tried to

2379
03:20:14.36 --> 03:20:19.96
extract the Marines from the landing zones. Heavy fire repeatedly drove them off and one battle

2380
03:20:19.96 --> 03:20:26.28
damage Jolly Green Giants forced landed on the coral seas deck. Our maintainers swiftly

2381
03:20:26.28 --> 03:20:31.72
patched it up a few hours later went back in action the fighting raged and our frustration level

2382
03:20:31.72 --> 03:20:37.48
grew. The birds kept taking hits and the Marines were reporting heavy casualties by dinner and air

2383
03:20:37.48 --> 03:20:43.88
fear force brought an AC 130 gunship and 5C 130's carrying 15,000 pound bombs known as

2384
03:20:43.88 --> 03:20:50.04
Blue 82's nicknamed Daisy Cutters. They were the biggest, most destructive conventional weapons in

2385
03:20:50.04 --> 03:20:55.72
the American arsenal. The first one detonated is Darrell noters watched from our deck Darrell saw

2386
03:20:55.72 --> 03:21:02.52
the enormous explosion followed by a shockwave. The blast unleashed. It was obscured by the island.

2387
03:21:02.52 --> 03:21:06.68
It obscured the island and swept right across the coral sea causing the huge carrier to shutter

2388
03:21:06.68 --> 03:21:12.44
from its impact. As darkness fell another Jolly Green staggered out of the moon list night.

2389
03:21:12.44 --> 03:21:17.72
The massive helicopter carried a crew of five and managed to pull aboard 34 Marines before

2390
03:21:17.72 --> 03:21:22.60
suffering engine travel. The crew set down on the carriers deck and when it's ramp dropped almost

2391
03:21:22.60 --> 03:21:28.44
three dozen wounded Marines tumbleed out onto the flight deck. The 15 Marines killed on

2392
03:21:28.44 --> 03:21:34.52
Coteang Island became the final men whose names were etched into the wall and washington a decade later.

2393
03:21:35.88 --> 03:21:40.36
Three more Marines declared missing an action on the island were captured by the Cameroos

2394
03:21:40.36 --> 03:21:49.40
and later beaten to death. After we took our wounded Marines to Subic Bay we steamed south

2395
03:21:49.40 --> 03:21:54.84
the birth for a 10 day port call. The Aussies welcomed us with great hospitality. We were treated

2396
03:21:54.84 --> 03:21:59.56
like family everywhere we went. The crew drank and laughed with our friends from down under and put

2397
03:21:59.56 --> 03:22:05.16
the scars of the war in our rearview mirrors. By the end of it I was so exhausted from all the

2398
03:22:05.16 --> 03:22:10.84
free drinks and parties that I crawled into my bunk and slept the sleep of a free man. The world

2399
03:22:10.84 --> 03:22:27.32
was at peace for the first time in 10 years. Roughly to close it out. Roughly to close out the war.

2400
03:22:27.32 --> 03:22:36.92
Never never let a men's sirt Marines unless a Marine helicopter sets a number one less

2401
03:22:36.92 --> 03:22:44.04
than we learned or that those were Air Force, Dally Green, Saur, Air Point but they never had

2402
03:22:44.04 --> 03:22:53.40
inserted and they weren't ready and we heard that Air Force general he heard that operation.

2403
03:22:53.40 --> 03:23:06.68
I got to fly. I took 12 or maybe 16 I can remember but I went downtown.

2404
03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:19.40
The capital city. I went downtown. The 500 knots at 500 feet. Right to the downtown

2405
03:23:19.40 --> 03:23:26.04
shock and I was looking for a sea of any makes came out or whether there were makes there.

2406
03:23:27.16 --> 03:23:36.36
But when it was over we were just glad. The the corpsmen and the doctors on the carrier did

2407
03:23:36.36 --> 03:23:41.64
surgery on those 30 Marines and everyone on the loose. It was awesome.

2408
03:23:41.64 --> 03:23:52.20
Yeah. But the big lesson in that is we had a president who said, I don't know if you're

2409
03:23:52.20 --> 03:23:59.56
sure. Don't use nukes but anything else goes. Yeah. And he did. That's decentralized command.

2410
03:23:59.56 --> 03:24:06.20
That's how it's let the frontline leaders make the decisions to win. That's the key.

2411
03:24:06.20 --> 03:24:13.96
Decision to win until your people will let them do it. They know how.

2412
03:24:18.84 --> 03:24:25.56
This section here is about the Tomcat. The F-14 Tomcat almost never made it into the world.

2413
03:24:26.12 --> 03:24:31.48
Thanks to Secretary Defense Robert S. McNamara who loved to think he knew people's business

2414
03:24:31.48 --> 03:24:38.28
better than they did. In 1968 he tried to force the Navy to adopt the whole King F-111 fighter

2415
03:24:38.28 --> 03:24:45.000
bomber for use on aircraft carriers. Imagine Sec Deft's Shagrin. When a mere three-star

2416
03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:50.28
admiral, the head of Naval Aviation at the Pentagon decided to stand in his way.

2417
03:24:51.16 --> 03:24:57.48
That truth telling sailor Tom Connelly testified to Congress. Quote, there isn't enough

2418
03:24:57.48 --> 03:25:03.88
thrust and Christian to make that airplane into a fighter and quote. And he won. The Navy avoided

2419
03:25:03.88 --> 03:25:09.80
being settled with the flying etsl so named by its unhappy air force pilots because of its

2420
03:25:09.80 --> 03:25:14.36
because it's chief advocate, Secretary McNamara had been president of Ford Motor Company.

2421
03:25:15.08 --> 03:25:21.16
McNamara took his revenge denying Vice Admiral Connelly a deserved promotion to a fourth star.

2422
03:25:21.16 --> 03:25:26.60
But the last word belonged to the Navy. It paid tribute to the great man by naming its new

2423
03:25:26.60 --> 03:25:33.32
world-beating fighter aircraft after him. The legendary Tom Cat was born. Though it fell

2424
03:25:33.32 --> 03:25:38.68
right in line with other grum and felines in history, Wildcat Hellcat Bearcat and Tiger Cat,

2425
03:25:38.68 --> 03:25:48.12
the name was the Artful Final Act in a Pentagon dogfight. That is totally legit.

2426
03:25:49.08 --> 03:25:54.76
The crazy thing is, you know, this is this is McNamara again, you know, with the with the

2427
03:25:54.76 --> 03:25:59.64
giant ego. Thinking he knows more than people that are actually, that are actually doing little

2428
03:25:59.64 --> 03:26:03.56
things like landing the aircraft on aircraft carriers in the middle of the night.

2429
03:26:09.64 --> 03:26:13.96
Fast forward a little bit. Through the post-war years, I was at sea more often than not,

2430
03:26:13.96 --> 03:26:18.60
commanding an air wing that included four F4 Phantom Squadrons, swells attack aircraft

2431
03:26:18.60 --> 03:26:22.68
bombers tankers early warning planes and helicopters was one of the most challenging and fun

2432
03:26:22.68 --> 03:26:27.80
jobs I ever had. In some ways, it is also a naval aviators last to raw with the fleet.

2433
03:26:27.80 --> 03:26:31.32
Once you get promoted out of air wing command, your flying days are limited.

2434
03:26:31.32 --> 03:26:35.80
Until that day comes, however, air wing commanders are expected to fly every type of plane in

2435
03:26:35.80 --> 03:26:41.24
their inventory. It was a hair-on-fire experience. In the space of a few days, I might fly an F4

2436
03:26:41.24 --> 03:26:46.76
Phantom and A6 intruder and a helicopter. In battle, I would have been leading strikes and coordinating

2437
03:26:46.76 --> 03:26:51.88
the attacks of my individual squadrons. The jobs a culmination of everything I had learned in

2438
03:26:51.88 --> 03:26:57.96
naval aviators career. All the lessons, all the mentoring by other officers,

2439
03:26:57.96 --> 03:27:04.92
comes in the way an air wing commander chooses to lead his men. Creating a culture of excellence,

2440
03:27:05.72 --> 03:27:13.96
of openness, and of self-avaluation so that your crews can improve and grow is an essential

2441
03:27:13.96 --> 03:27:20.44
element to success. That's something every leader should just get out their notebook and write down.

2442
03:27:20.44 --> 03:27:26.60
Creating a culture of excellence of openness and of self-avaluation so that your crews can improve

2443
03:27:26.60 --> 03:27:32.60
and grow isn't essential element to success. aboard the coral sea, I used the leadership

2444
03:27:32.60 --> 03:27:38.92
techniques we developed at Top Gun to set that framework. I let my squadron commanders run their

2445
03:27:38.92 --> 03:27:48.44
own shows without micro-managing them. That is your life's work of leadership building into that

2446
03:27:48.44 --> 03:27:56.04
attitude and keeping that attitude that you used the top gun to lead in this other situation.

2447
03:27:56.84 --> 03:27:59.16
Still works. If it works, why do you?

2448
03:28:02.52 --> 03:28:07.80
1976, I stepped out of the cockpit for one last time as a full-time aviator and said farewell to my

2449
03:28:07.80 --> 03:28:12.84
air wing. The Navy promoted me to Captain and now as a senior officer at last. While it's still

2450
03:28:12.84 --> 03:28:17.32
get to fly from time to time, the truth was that my days as a combat aviator were over. I suppose

2451
03:28:17.32 --> 03:28:21.64
it would have been harder to take. Had there been nothing but desks jobs on the horizon for me.

2452
03:28:21.64 --> 03:28:26.84
Thank God that was not the case. Ronald Wilson Reagan was my commander in chief, the prestige of

2453
03:28:26.84 --> 03:28:31.96
naval aviation and the military generally was set for resurgence after many years and the

2454
03:28:31.96 --> 03:28:37.32
Dolgrem's falling that would draw from Vietnam. It was a fine time for a newly minted captain

2455
03:28:37.32 --> 03:28:49.24
to take command. I was going to see as the skipper of my own ship. Talk about a wake-up call

2456
03:28:49.24 --> 03:28:55.24
from flying fighters at Mach 2. I found myself navigating the Pacific at 12 knots. On the bridge of

2457
03:28:55.24 --> 03:29:04.12
a 40,000 ton, 660 foot long behemoth, crude by 22 officers in 400 men. While we had two Boeing H46C

2458
03:29:04.12 --> 03:29:08.84
night helicopters to help run vertical replenishment missions between our ship and those we

2459
03:29:08.84 --> 03:29:14.36
service for the first time in my career. I had virtually no connection to flying fixed wing aircraft.

2460
03:29:14.36 --> 03:29:20.92
It was a big transition for me personally. So you took over a ship and this ship is a resupply ship.

2461
03:29:22.92 --> 03:29:30.92
I was on board a ship. A Navy ship. So I'd probably been in the Navy for four years before I

2462
03:29:30.92 --> 03:29:39.96
actually went on a ship for any length of time. I was on board a NLPD, an amphib, and we were out

2463
03:29:39.96 --> 03:29:45.16
and we were doing for the first time. It was an unrep with avert rep. What do they call when they

2464
03:29:45.16 --> 03:29:50.68
combine them together? What's it called? Is it a name for it? Same. Okay. So it's an under-way

2465
03:29:50.68 --> 03:29:56.92
replenishment and a vertical replenishment and then there were doing two ships at the same time.

2466
03:29:56.92 --> 03:30:03.000
One on each side. When I saw this and like I said, I'd been in the SEAL teams for four years or

2467
03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:09.32
three years in the SEAL teams and plus you know going through SEAL training, I could not believe what

2468
03:30:09.32 --> 03:30:15.64
I was watching. This is an insane operation. There's a ship which is the one that you drove

2469
03:30:15.64 --> 03:30:23.16
is the ship in the middle and it's got fuel on it and it's got food on it and they pull these things

2470
03:30:23.16 --> 03:30:31.16
along side each other. They're probably 15 yards apart. Something like that? Little more.

2471
03:30:31.16 --> 03:30:38.20
Little more than that? 120, 140 feet. Okay. So I'm maybe I'm a little bit, you know, I'm maybe

2472
03:30:38.20 --> 03:30:43.000
not remembering. I'll tell you what it looked like to my young eyes. It looked like we were about

2473
03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:48.12
the crash. That's what it looked like. And these, they're going whatever seven or eight,

2474
03:30:48.12 --> 03:30:54.04
ten knots. What's the 12 knots? You're steaming through the sea. These ships are within. What's

2475
03:30:54.04 --> 03:30:58.52
so what is it? We're talking 30 yards apart. They're 30 yards apart from each other. Massive

2476
03:30:58.52 --> 03:31:07.96
vessels. They're connected by a by giant hoses that are pumping oil and gas on board. So there's

2477
03:31:07.96 --> 03:31:12.52
flammable liquid, you know, flowing through these hoses and then on top that you have helicopters

2478
03:31:12.52 --> 03:31:18.76
that are landing and taking off, bringing gear and food from one ship to another. It's insane.

2479
03:31:18.76 --> 03:31:26.20
That's a verd, right, man. It's a really good heel of pilots. Oh yeah. Yeah. We always, you know,

2480
03:31:26.20 --> 03:31:34.12
you were talking about the, you know, air force helicopter pilots or, or for me, the Navy pilots

2481
03:31:34.12 --> 03:31:38.84
were the best pilots we could get when I, when I first got in the Navy because those guys hovered

2482
03:31:38.84 --> 03:31:43.56
at over, they hovered over these ships all the time. That's what they did for a living. So they'd

2483
03:31:43.56 --> 03:31:47.08
come into drop us on a fast rope. They would hold station like it was a joke. They'd be like,

2484
03:31:47.08 --> 03:31:50.92
no problem. Or sit in here. Well, stay here as well. Right where you want us as long as we can.

2485
03:31:52.20 --> 03:31:56.28
But the purpose of you being in command of this ship is so that you can understand the logistics

2486
03:31:56.28 --> 03:32:01.88
of the Navy and how to, oh, sure. How to drive a ship in the hopes that you can do a good enough

2487
03:32:01.88 --> 03:32:07.88
job that they go, okay, this guy can, this guy can manage an aircraft carrier. And, and that's

2488
03:32:07.88 --> 03:32:17.56
what they did. It's a prerequisite. Pre-requisite to get you what you wanted or, I guess, maybe the ultimate

2489
03:32:17.56 --> 03:32:24.28
goal of someone in your shoes was to be in command of an aircraft carrier. And you got it. You got,

2490
03:32:25.16 --> 03:32:29.72
you say this, the Ranger, which was your aircraft carrier, is my ship now, perched on the bridge,

2491
03:32:29.72 --> 03:32:36.04
seated in a barber chair with skipper stencil on its back. I watched the bustle of the flight deck

2492
03:32:36.04 --> 03:32:40.92
from the best seat in the house. I was 46 years old. Still wearing the Ray bands. I bought in

2493
03:32:40.92 --> 03:32:46.04
Pensacola and the Star of David chain around my neck that was given to you by your Israeli friends.

2494
03:32:46.04 --> 03:32:50.28
My little mouse from North Island was tucked away in the captain's cabin a few yards,

2495
03:32:50.28 --> 03:32:56.60
after my chair. These three towels min served every day as a reminder of who I was and where I came

2496
03:32:56.60 --> 03:33:00.04
from since I first climbed into the cockpit in Pensacola.

2497
03:33:00.04 --> 03:33:10.84
As you start talking about, so what year is this? This is like 81, 82,

2498
03:33:10.84 --> 03:33:17.88
on the carrier. Yeah. 80, 80, 81, 82. You start talking about the fact that there's a,

2499
03:33:18.44 --> 03:33:24.60
there's a drug problem in the Navy. There's a number one problem in my entire

2500
03:33:24.60 --> 03:33:33.08
time on ships. What's a drugs? And you're dealing with this. You have guys getting in trouble.

2501
03:33:33.08 --> 03:33:37.24
You have guys trying to kill themselves. I mean, you detail this again from a leadership perspective.

2502
03:33:37.24 --> 03:33:43.72
It's a great part of the book. And then there's something else that happens that I'm going to

2503
03:33:43.72 --> 03:33:49.48
go into here. My ship's company suffered a terrible tragedy. A young airman named Paul.

2504
03:33:49.48 --> 03:33:56.44
How do you say his last name? Taurus. Taurus. Taurus. Taurus. Collapsed and died while we were at

2505
03:33:56.44 --> 03:34:00.36
Subic Bay about three weeks after we rescued some refugees which you go into.

2506
03:34:01.08 --> 03:34:05.96
Taurus was a sad story. A 20 year old from Michigan who's time in uniform as a case study

2507
03:34:05.96 --> 03:34:10.60
in the devastation wrought by drugs in our Navy. Having served for three years he had never been

2508
03:34:10.60 --> 03:34:15.32
promoted. In fact, he was in frequent trouble and tried to desert twice. His squadron commander

2509
03:34:15.32 --> 03:34:21.000
disciplined him repeatedly. He was no stranger to our correctional custody training unit or CCU.

2510
03:34:21.96 --> 03:34:27.40
Nothing seemed to work. He remained an often belligerent hard case who frustrated his squadron

2511
03:34:27.40 --> 03:34:32.60
commander. I never met this sailor, but his death changed my life forever. The ship had just

2512
03:34:32.60 --> 03:34:38.04
returned from a five day visit to Hong Kong where he was an unauthorized absentee.

2513
03:34:38.04 --> 03:34:45.72
He was next in the CCU that April of 1981. My understanding from the Navy investigation that

2514
03:34:45.72 --> 03:34:51.64
followed his death is that combat. As always, he fought with a couple of our senior pedi officers who

2515
03:34:51.64 --> 03:34:57.96
then took him up on the flight deck in order to start jogging. It was routine exercise in the

2516
03:34:57.96 --> 03:35:06.28
swell-turing Subic Bay heat. Taurus had previously been restricted to bread and water as a result

2517
03:35:06.28 --> 03:35:11.56
of his combativeness. As he was running, he collapsed. Taken below. He began to have seizures.

2518
03:35:11.56 --> 03:35:16.36
30 minutes later, medical personnel arrived to treat him, but sadly he died soon after. The Navy

2519
03:35:16.36 --> 03:35:20.36
determined he had gone into cardiac arrest as a result of heat exhaustion.

2520
03:35:26.44 --> 03:35:33.32
So this is just a horrible situation. And

2521
03:35:33.32 --> 03:35:49.96
there's an investigation. They get done with the investigation. You get a punitive letter or non-punitive

2522
03:35:49.96 --> 03:35:56.12
letter. So you get a letter that says, hey, this shouldn't happen because as we know, a commanding

2523
03:35:56.12 --> 03:36:04.04
officer's responsible for everything that happens. That's key right there. Five thousand, four hundred

2524
03:36:04.04 --> 03:36:11.96
guys, and one of them happens to be on drugs. My guys, the medical department made a couple of mistakes.

2525
03:36:11.96 --> 03:36:21.32
The Mo1 nervous once time was unacceptable. That young fellow is disciplined. On the carrier,

2526
03:36:21.32 --> 03:36:29.16
I let the squadron commanders run their own discipline cases. And they work a long time

2527
03:36:29.56 --> 03:36:37.32
to become a commander of a squadron. No doubt. So I let them do it. And his squadron commander that

2528
03:36:37.32 --> 03:36:47.32
young man was, he was a patty, too easy. A guy had been the mass about four or five times.

2529
03:36:47.32 --> 03:36:54.52
He should have thrown his ass out of the military. But he just kept going back to his drugs.

2530
03:36:55.56 --> 03:37:06.76
And ultimately died. And his parents were very successful people in Michigan.

2531
03:37:06.76 --> 03:37:18.12
And then through the Washington bureaucracy, SUNY, for $8 million, maybe went through grand jury

2532
03:37:18.12 --> 03:37:27.96
in Washington. They found, you know, I wasn't liable for anything except that you become a political

2533
03:37:27.96 --> 03:37:38.60
liability in Washington as a senior naval officer. And that's what happened. And I don't think we

2534
03:37:38.60 --> 03:37:45.24
need to put any of this in. I'm gonna, I've addressed it in the new book. But what happened was,

2535
03:37:45.24 --> 03:37:52.52
I went, I got a great job out of the carrier tour. They sent me to to a sing-pack fleeing.

2536
03:37:52.52 --> 03:38:00.36
And I got the current officer job. Which you do cover that in his book. And I'll let you out.

2537
03:38:00.36 --> 03:38:05.72
Well, no, it's all right. It's all right. I got a phone call from CNN. Is that in there? Yeah,

2538
03:38:05.72 --> 03:38:10.60
that's in there. Go ahead then. Well, you're gonna cover. I just want to make sure that

2539
03:38:10.60 --> 03:38:16.68
the three of you understand that. I got a call from CNN and invited me to back to Washington.

2540
03:38:16.68 --> 03:38:25.000
I flew back. It's been a whole morning at Moldim Watkins, a new sub-mariner. I'd worked for before.

2541
03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:33.80
He knew me well. And he says, I just spent the whole morning drink coffee and smoke a cigarette

2542
03:38:33.80 --> 03:38:41.64
with him. And he said, I did everything I could do. And I know it's true because I can cover a

2543
03:38:41.64 --> 03:38:51.16
collaboration from his what he said, me said. But politically, he said, stay in the Navy.

2544
03:38:52.28 --> 03:39:01.08
And I'll see you're so like, did I meant so like and for flying? And I looked at the who the

2545
03:39:01.08 --> 03:39:11.48
opposition was a senator for Michigan. And you can tell it's a tough thing to talk about. And he was

2546
03:39:12.20 --> 03:39:17.72
going to be Germany armed services committee. This senator from Michigan was going to be chairman

2547
03:39:18.28 --> 03:39:27.96
Carl 11. And so I was never he's a one that sponsored the lawsuit on the I of the family.

2548
03:39:27.96 --> 03:39:36.52
He controls five federal judges and I thought shit, it's over. So I went back and talked to

2549
03:39:37.16 --> 03:39:43.24
talked to a home and talked to my wife and got out of the Navy two weeks later.

2550
03:39:45.16 --> 03:39:48.04
And I just had a great time.

2551
03:39:49.64 --> 03:39:54.36
Yeah, it's it's a it's a strange things for civilians may not realize this when you become when you

2552
03:39:54.36 --> 03:40:01.64
get selected for admiral it has to be approved by a conderson and or yeah and it's like you said

2553
03:40:01.64 --> 03:40:06.44
it's a very political thing. And I've seen it I've seen get some guys get ripped apart by it.

2554
03:40:06.44 --> 03:40:13.08
Something will come up and people will protest and it's a political thing. And as you say here

2555
03:40:13.08 --> 03:40:18.36
that's just how Washington worked. I resigned my staff position and retired two weeks later on March

2556
03:40:18.36 --> 03:40:31.80
first 1983 after 29 years one month and one day in uniform. It's a it's a you know you talked

2557
03:40:31.80 --> 03:40:37.64
earlier about how in combat you can make the right decisions you can do the right thing you can have

2558
03:40:37.64 --> 03:40:46.44
the right plan and you can still something can still go wrong. And it's a very risky thing when you get

2559
03:40:46.44 --> 03:40:51.80
to those high ranks in the Navy you can do the right thing you can know the right people and you can

2560
03:40:51.80 --> 03:41:01.72
still get tripped up in that the last the last hurdle by by the smallest by something that's

2561
03:41:03.08 --> 03:41:14.68
yeah. So transition when I returned to California that spring I felt like a refugee in my own home

2562
03:41:14.68 --> 03:41:20.20
town. I was almost 50 years old starting over from scratch I needed to find a new sense of normal

2563
03:41:20.20 --> 03:41:25.72
for me normal is waking up in my cabin to the smell of salt air coming through a brass port hole.

2564
03:41:26.76 --> 03:41:32.28
It was the heavy jolt of a catapult launch the euphoria of breaking mock one in a vertical climb.

2565
03:41:32.28 --> 03:41:38.60
It was long beautiful nights night flights across our country and the sense of purpose I felt when

2566
03:41:38.60 --> 03:41:45.08
we saved lives it's see it was the fear of flying strikes in the north Vietnam the honor of leading

2567
03:41:45.08 --> 03:41:50.76
top gun alongside some of the finest young man America'd ever produced it was welcoming old friends

2568
03:41:50.76 --> 03:41:55.96
back from the Hanoi Hilton and holding membership in a brotherhood that defined my entire adult life.

2569
03:41:57.80 --> 03:42:03.88
In civilian life it was no normal for me. I struggled. My first marriage did not survive

2570
03:42:03.88 --> 03:42:08.44
the many deployments of the 1970s being gone so much finally drove a wedge between us that could not

2571
03:42:08.44 --> 03:42:13.40
be removed. I married a second time while serving in surface ships. Every the optimist I guess

2572
03:42:13.40 --> 03:42:18.52
it wasn't meant to be. I could have gone on to into the defense industry like so many other

2573
03:42:18.52 --> 03:42:23.48
retired military offers do great salaries great benefits. I refused to do that instead I went

2574
03:42:23.48 --> 03:42:28.36
into business for myself and Southern California. The leadership principles I learned in the navy

2575
03:42:28.36 --> 03:42:36.52
played a large role in my success. What business did you get into? I worked in her team and

2576
03:42:36.52 --> 03:42:43.48
in the street for a while and then I built. I couldn't build anything. She can she visualise that I

2577
03:42:43.48 --> 03:42:55.40
could build it. We did a lot of beautiful homes and stuff like that. You know you detail the

2578
03:42:55.40 --> 03:43:01.64
I guess I'm going to use the word. I don't know if this word's been used on this podcast before

2579
03:43:01.64 --> 03:43:07.72
brace yourself. You detail the romantic aspect of this the way this folds unfolds in the book and

2580
03:43:07.72 --> 03:43:15.000
it's just a beautiful story about you know Mary Beth you guys you know connect again during

2581
03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:28.12
all this turmoil and you end up with the girl that you originally fell in love with. So again

2582
03:43:28.12 --> 03:43:37.16
that's another aspect that you got to you got to read the book to to understand. You also go into

2583
03:43:37.16 --> 03:43:47.24
the F-35 and what that program consists of and what the shortfalls are and what the shortfalls

2584
03:43:47.24 --> 03:43:51.32
of the training program can be and what they have to watch out for and like you talked about

2585
03:43:51.32 --> 03:43:59.48
early the struggles of the top-gun program and you know when you get to it you got to a point

2586
03:43:59.48 --> 03:44:03.96
in the end of the book here where you start talking about what a winning team. If you were going

2587
03:44:03.96 --> 03:44:07.88
to build a winning team what it would look like I'm just going to summarize some of the things you say.

2588
03:44:08.44 --> 03:44:13.08
You say because the basic truth of fighter combat remains the same it is not the aircraft that

2589
03:44:13.08 --> 03:44:18.76
wins a fight it's the man in the cockpit flying is a perishable skill it has to be practiced

2590
03:44:18.76 --> 03:44:25.32
constantly and maintained on a consistent basis. My boys will all be dogfighters with enough planes

2591
03:44:25.80 --> 03:44:30.36
in inventory we can return to the days when any pilot who's who's in good with the senior

2592
03:44:30.36 --> 03:44:35.80
chief in maintenance control can check out a burn and go find a fight club somewhere off the coast.

2593
03:44:35.80 --> 03:44:42.04
That's how we'll sharpen our edge and dark fog fighting again. I run through this mental exercise

2594
03:44:42.04 --> 03:44:49.08
often. I always come back to this our top-gun maximum. What matters is the man not the machine.

2595
03:44:49.08 --> 03:44:53.96
So let's talk about what a good fighter pilot candidate looks like over the years and thousands

2596
03:44:53.96 --> 03:45:01.72
of aviators I've known I've noticed the best share some common traits a good pilot would have

2597
03:45:01.72 --> 03:45:07.24
a multi a patriotic mindset and a self-starting work ethic. He should believe in something

2598
03:45:07.24 --> 03:45:12.52
greater than himself while remaining self-reliant and confident without being overbearing.

2599
03:45:12.52 --> 03:45:18.60
Some ego is necessary. I wouldn't want a soul filled without flying in my wing and athletic

2600
03:45:18.60 --> 03:45:24.20
background helps because when properly coached at the right age youngsters learn trust, teamwork,

2601
03:45:24.20 --> 03:45:30.44
and goal setting. They'll need all those things in the air. I'll pass on anybody who displays

2602
03:45:30.44 --> 03:45:37.40
his participation trophies. Self esteem without real accomplishment will make anyone crash and burn.

2603
03:45:38.28 --> 03:45:44.44
Give me a committed B student with a boiling will to win over an A plus scholar with a careerist

2604
03:45:44.44 --> 03:45:51.000
agenda and will be on our way. Finally it's important to have a sincere interest in the history

2605
03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:56.92
and lore of your calling. Good pilot strive constantly for self-improvement. In my first years

2606
03:45:56.92 --> 03:46:01.64
in the Navy I had the opportunity to meet the World War II generation and hear their stories and

2607
03:46:01.64 --> 03:46:11.000
lessons. I read every combat memoir I could could and glean a lot of little things from them that

2608
03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:16.68
helped me in my journey. We lived on the edge of life and death and the margin between them was

2609
03:46:16.68 --> 03:46:23.96
narrow. I think Jimmy do little bought me a scotch and that's a story you tell earlier because

2610
03:46:23.96 --> 03:46:31.000
he saw that we had shared residency there. History is a wellspring of life saving lessons. No

2611
03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:38.76
one really invents anything. Successful leaders recognize those traits and encourage them even at the

2612
03:46:38.76 --> 03:46:49.88
risk of bending a rule or a jet once in a while. And you close out the book with this. Well that's

2613
03:46:49.88 --> 03:46:57.000
what naval aviation would look like if I were king of everything. Since I'm not, I think I

2614
03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:04.52
ought to call it a night. Come on inside. I have one last thing to show you. I kept my 1950s Ray

2615
03:47:04.52 --> 03:47:09.16
Bands until just a few years ago when I replaced the lenses and gave them to my granddaughter

2616
03:47:09.16 --> 03:47:14.44
at her request as a Christmas gift. At 50 years I figured it was time for a new pair.

2617
03:47:15.72 --> 03:47:20.12
My youngest daughter Candace ended up with my star of David and Gold Chain.

2618
03:47:21.16 --> 03:47:27.80
But I still have my little mouse. After all the C-duty he endured, he enjoys a cushy retirement

2619
03:47:27.80 --> 03:47:32.92
on my bookshelf. From time to time I look at him and say it was a hell of a ride,

2620
03:47:32.92 --> 03:47:39.24
wasn't it little fella. He is surrounded by books and other treasured items from my career.

2621
03:47:40.36 --> 03:47:47.24
But what I value most was my time at Miramar with the Bros. They're enduring friendship

2622
03:47:47.64 --> 03:47:54.68
or my real treasures, not any physical things in my library. Top Gun will always be the centerpiece

2623
03:47:54.68 --> 03:48:01.64
of my career and my life's most important accomplishment. None of it would have happened without the

2624
03:48:01.64 --> 03:48:10.36
Bros or the ever-present hands of God. Thank you.

2625
03:48:17.16 --> 03:48:28.92
Yeah. You know what you do? You're really my compliments. And you know,

2626
03:48:28.92 --> 03:48:37.24
it didn't in well. I didn't stay on in the Navy. But I got out.

2627
03:48:38.12 --> 03:48:43.24
Come over to the desert. Let me host you. Come on over and I'll show you. I'll live.

2628
03:48:43.80 --> 03:48:48.52
It's completely care we had. I got a home up there and an apartment adjacent to it.

2629
03:48:49.24 --> 03:48:56.76
It's full of our son, the doctor and his girlfriend who's a college officer there every weekend with us.

2630
03:48:56.76 --> 03:49:05.96
Life is good. And how I stayed in the Navy had you stayed in the Navy? Who did tell what you

2631
03:49:05.96 --> 03:49:15.72
did? You know what? I found right afterwards it's in here. After 32 years, I found total happiness.

2632
03:49:16.68 --> 03:49:24.28
And between us, we've done it all. We've been all over the world. We've got the home.

2633
03:49:24.28 --> 03:49:36.36
Everything we've done has just been so enjoyable. Well, you know, sir, as I read this book and

2634
03:49:36.36 --> 03:49:43.88
just think about the incredible life that you've lived. And even when you talk about what you've

2635
03:49:43.88 --> 03:49:54.36
done since you left the Navy. And it sounds awesome. But no doubt. I mean, without question, the

2636
03:49:54.36 --> 03:50:02.76
legacy that you left and your bros left in the Navy, in the aviation community, in the military

2637
03:50:02.76 --> 03:50:08.44
to have an attitude to push the envelope, to take risks, to push back when things don't make

2638
03:50:08.44 --> 03:50:21.56
sense that is a legacy that will never die. I know that now. It's been a remarkable day. I've

2639
03:50:21.56 --> 03:50:28.60
done a lot of interviews, maybe a hundred. But I've never done anything I enjoyed more than today.

2640
03:50:28.60 --> 03:50:43.56
You keep in touch with me. Sir, I admire what you're doing. And you know the philosophy and

2641
03:50:43.56 --> 03:50:50.60
what you're building the followers. You can make a lot of money on the outside. I know that

2642
03:50:50.60 --> 03:51:00.60
we've done fine. But you will never. I've got a lot of friends. But you'll never have the quality

2643
03:51:00.60 --> 03:51:07.000
of friendship. You have with the brotherhood. The brotherhood is sales, UDT, guys, a history.

2644
03:51:07.96 --> 03:51:14.92
You won't find those out there. The guy called in there to Godfather that when I got out,

2645
03:51:14.92 --> 03:51:23.64
he kept me going. Not financially, but advice and mentoring. And pray and pray and man.

2646
03:51:24.84 --> 03:51:31.32
Daryl Gary, if you really want to interview some people, interview Daryl Gary, condor.

2647
03:51:32.68 --> 03:51:40.68
I won't get into his personal wealth at his bins. But he and he lives a spiritual Santa Fe.

2648
03:51:40.68 --> 03:51:46.52
That told us. I got to be honest with you. You being here. This is not, I kind of had a sense of what

2649
03:51:46.52 --> 03:51:52.92
there would be like. I was off a lot. This is really, this is really special for me to listen to the

2650
03:51:52.92 --> 03:51:59.48
conversation between you and Jaco. I know Jaco and I know you having never known you. I think the

2651
03:51:59.48 --> 03:52:05.56
way you describe it is everybody knows yank. Look, I was just a bro for three years. And I spent

2652
03:52:05.56 --> 03:52:14.20
most of my time. I've done so much less than I've been given. It's kind of crazy to sit here and listen

2653
03:52:14.20 --> 03:52:19.08
to you tell all these stories about all these places. And I've been to every one of them. I was a

2654
03:52:19.08 --> 03:52:25.24
Marine at Miramar because you guys left in anger to South, took over top Guns Spaces as a Marine.

2655
03:52:26.20 --> 03:52:32.52
I was a training officer at Top Gun. You could buy count on your hands and a Marine that ever

2656
03:52:32.52 --> 03:52:38.76
gotten to do that because I went to an air show at El Toro when I was five. And so now I'm sitting here

2657
03:52:38.76 --> 03:52:44.60
listening and talking about all the things you did and it just adds more to the pile of things that have

2658
03:52:44.60 --> 03:52:49.88
happened to me beyond my control that let me do all these other cool things that by myself I could have

2659
03:52:49.88 --> 03:52:58.44
never ever done. And I have a shred of connection to the legacy to read a book and give it to Jaco.

2660
03:52:58.44 --> 03:53:02.20
Hey man, we might want to do this. I could probably set this thing up and then from the

2661
03:53:02.20 --> 03:53:07.72
outside watch the conversation between two other people and for the first time in my career

2662
03:53:08.52 --> 03:53:14.76
start to recognize how much bigger this thing really is than I ever understood because I lived

2663
03:53:14.76 --> 03:53:18.84
inside of it and I was just working. I didn't know what I was doing. I was just working.

2664
03:53:18.84 --> 03:53:22.20
It's probably just a short of a top Gun and I was just working and then I left and I want to do

2665
03:53:22.20 --> 03:53:29.96
other things. And now I'm sitting here learning more about what I did than I ever knew while I was

2666
03:53:29.96 --> 03:53:37.80
doing it. And it's just another reminder of how much more I have. There's so much how much more I need to

2667
03:53:37.80 --> 03:53:44.36
learn how much less I know than I should. There's the been the best four hours man to sit here and

2677
03:54:47.08 --> 03:54:57.40
suspecting that perhaps that podcast we would touch on a bunch of things but wouldn't dive too deep

2678
03:54:57.40 --> 03:55:02.92
on certain subjects that got raised in my head so we're gonna actually have to follow up we'll do

03:55:31.88 --> 03:55:41.48
trying to get better something we should all probably be doing trying to get better.

2684
03:55:43.48 --> 03:55:50.44
Echo since you agree yes how would you give us some recommendations on how do we get better how to

stay on the path how to improve on the path all right well jockel few is one way to stay on the path

2686
03:55:58.60 --> 03:56:04.68
all right sometimes we need help we need help on the path so we will turn to jockel feel okay

2687
03:56:04.68 --> 03:56:09.80
what is this supplements joint warfare these for your joints joint warfare superkrill oil

2688
03:56:09.80 --> 03:56:16.36
discipline and discipline go also milk for additional protein in the form of the

2689
03:56:16.36 --> 03:56:21.40
dessert by the way where he keep milk as well for the for the younger ones formulated

2690
03:56:21.40 --> 03:56:26.36
a little bit different more towards you know the younger ones also jockel weight tea this is

2691
03:56:26.36 --> 03:56:33.80
less of a supplement by the way more of every day you know beverage scenario when it gets warm out

2692
03:56:33.80 --> 03:56:41.64
yes sir the cold jockel weight tea is totally legit and it it gives you a little

2693
03:56:42.52 --> 03:56:48.60
little psychological boost and a little physiological boost take them both utilizing both that's what I'm

2694
03:56:48.60 --> 03:56:57.08
thinking I'll all agree with Ellen I know I know Dave Burke yes has been pounding cold war

2695
03:56:59.16 --> 03:57:06.44
every day yeah it's part of my regimen you can smell the garlic it's it's preemptive yeah

2696
03:57:06.44 --> 03:57:11.000
I don't want to react to the war I want to get out in front of that war I'm going to wage war in advance

2697
03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:16.52
like cold war absolutely so I I was my daughter a couple months ago is getting sick

2698
03:57:16.52 --> 03:57:23.32
and I was like hey you know what you take these you know takes some cold war and she says I don't

2699
03:57:23.32 --> 03:57:28.84
like taking she doesn't like taking pills and I go no problem you know what I'll put some and

2700
03:57:28.84 --> 03:57:35.56
I'll break them open put it in the glass stirred up you can just drink it bro you cannot do that

2701
03:57:35.56 --> 03:57:43.72
with cold war you can not do that with cold war it is it was so it smelled so bad it was so offensive

2702
03:57:43.72 --> 03:57:48.44
to drink because I drank it but it was everything in my power to get it down my daughter said

2703
03:57:48.44 --> 03:57:54.92
I my daughter this is my 10 year old daughter you know she said I'm not drinking that I said cool

2704
03:57:55.48 --> 03:57:59.32
I go and I've you know tried to keep them normal face after I drank it was like I just did

2705
03:58:00.36 --> 03:58:09.40
shot a tequila I was like you should have just said that it snaps see so you know

2706
03:58:09.40 --> 03:58:14.60
could it could it convey them but more you know inspiring messages for as the taste oh yeah

2707
03:58:14.60 --> 03:58:19.88
you know actually I don't think it's it snaps by the way there's two things I confirmed with my

2708
03:58:19.88 --> 03:58:27.48
daughters you can say either it snapped or it slaps the way I don't try and get on it I have the

2709
03:58:28.28 --> 03:58:33.80
the the the the individuals that are in the game yeah that was I was I got someone you know

2710
03:58:33.80 --> 03:58:38.68
educated me on it said it was probably it slaps and I kind of recalled a little bit I heard someone

2711
03:58:38.68 --> 03:58:43.88
say it slaps before it was about a song if I'm not mistaken so I'm like okay it slaps

2712
03:58:43.88 --> 03:58:51.32
jock will hurt you wrong it snaps I've never heard it snaps I now to put myself on report my kids

2713
03:58:51.32 --> 03:58:59.64
also say she snapped so maybe I didn't fuse him like if you did a good job on the GJ2

2714
03:58:59.64 --> 03:59:08.12
mats did a good arm lock yeah and yeah oh he snapped okay so maybe I mixed it up I'm 48
