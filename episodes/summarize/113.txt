it's it's important to to make that distinction that's where you know using using that shaping of behavior as your best friend in terms of you know like I said I use a classroom you know there's a reason why libraries and classrooms are the environments that they are so when we teach our kids what we want them to know it's a distraction for your environment it's you know positive learning experience it's a it's a petri dish for education when when you try to do things where you know the dog is in the house and doing all these other things you know there's all these other stimuli going on and it's distracting and the dog's not picking it up and I rack on a raid that resulted in an intense firefight he and his hand the reproach to building suspected of housing cached munitions just short of the entryway a remotely detonated i.e. through the pair back several yards Carlos broke his back into hind legs and hips and collapsed his signices and his lungs for privacy reasons I can't go to the injuries his handler sustained other than to say that they were extensive medical personnel acted quickly and both the dog and the handler survived Carlos nearly prevented that emergency treatment from being initiated despite the severity of his injuries he crawled to his handler side and took up a defensive perimeter near his fallen combat had no one trained Carlos to do that he did it for one reason loyalty and that you know that can't be taught you know just like it can't be in and people it can be reinforced you know it can be conditioned and tweaked a little bit one way or another it can be broken for sure but that that is in my opinion a primal genetically inherited trait that either exists or it doesn't just like with heart you know and that's that's something that's excruciatingly rare obviously both in humans and dogs and that's one of the one of the ways I test a dog is is that is I want to test their heart and and see if if when push comes to shove if they if they want to fight me you know do I want a dog that's going to play a deterrent role in terms of protection and you know do I just want an active companion do I want a docile dog that you know my kids can snuggle with you know so to me again just like with the kind of the the macrocosm of you know what what do you want out of the dog you know let that drive your decision to work backwards from there and it's getting clippin it to it like this dog's making me a little nervous because he's walking around looking at me like I don't sweat you that's one of the biggest misconceptions is growling you know people think you know growling growling is weakness growling is being scared and and it's peacock feathers essentially it's a dog's way of saying you're making me uncomfortable I'm going to do this and in hopes that it makes you you know it calls your bluff and backs you down when I see a dog at growls I know I can get in this head faster than a dog at stand so he's variable rewards with the dogs so with with with with training it's kind of again it just falls into a cumulative process at first it's every time you know so that there's the consistency so that that that's the explanation of the expectation is that you do this you get that you do this you get that until now it's it's wired once it's wired now it becomes just like if every time you pick anything pick anything you like you know every Friday we're having steak and ice cream like after a while it's like no steak and ice cream again so that that dog will get to a point where now it's actually we're not having steak and ice cream we're having tofu burgers jokes on you like wait what you know so now whatever it took that week to get steak and ice cream on Friday maybe I'm going to work a little harder and you'll see that out of them and so and this is more on the on the competitive side and and you know to me if if nothing else let it be an experiment and practice for the rest of your relationships you know because it does transpire or transcend rather you know just just training a dog but the online training just a month by month you'll let they can go to team dog dot pet to check that out it's you know team dog dot pet dot that's where you have online training where people can learn to solve these problems that they have with a dog build a good relationship with a dog and train their dog it's all tall crap honestly um what I like to do is is just like in in any other selection process I want to take the dog out of his comfort zone and see how he how he reacts his comfort zone is where he's been raised where he's been living with his littermates with his mom you know if you go to a breeder's house and you evaluate a puppy with the the litter running around in the mom standing there you are not getting an accurate representation of what that dog's genetic components are not even close there there are so many things that have been smoked and mirrored in the dog's benefit he's going to look much stronger and better and and active and drive your endominant and whatever then then he truly is if you want to really see that dog at his genetic face value take him somewhere where you know he hasn't been by himself you tell me home depot which I think is a great because there's things going on at home depot there's noises there's a bunch of people running around there's other dogs in there there's kids there's all kinds of chaos going on in the people A lot of people do that there's training franchises that the backbone is using remote collar which I vehemently disagree with and it's not about a cruelty thing it's about an understanding is that if I if I have a great relationship with that dog and again you know the work environment whatever spouse and then we've gone the full run of shaping and reinforcing desired behaviors and I have clearly communicated to him and positively taught him what the expectations are now when he's not performing up to that standard now if I correct him and punish him guess how much more effective it is you know because at first you're just you're just some other jerk that's putting your knee in my rib cage or electrocuting me or you know jerking me off my feet with a prong collar just like all the rest of him where is now it's like your dad saying I'm disappointed in you know what you know it's it's it's and and then the last thing is that the instant that the behavior has ceased the punishment has to also what you find a lot of times most times and especially early on if that relationship has been built and that foundation isn't there again I can't explain anything to a dog a lot of a lot of people you know we all have our expectations I know I want the dog to sit I don't want them to grab sandwiches I don't know not the kids over I don't want them to bark when it's three in the morning unless there's somebody breaking in he doesn't know any of that you know but I think that's better that's far more impactful you know I mean think about a buzz and structure like not I'm really scream at you know it's the it's the antithesis of the of the Marine Corps DI like it's just white noise at that point just standing like however when that dude's like whispering like I'm gonna I'm gonna snatch the life out of your soul and crush it right front of your face you know kids yeah he got got the full spectrum got the full retirement good deal you know dogs possess here back to the book dogs possess the capability to be loyal capability to be loyal a dog owner as a dog owner you should not take that loyalty for granted or exploit it you should work to give your dog a reason to be the most loyal to you he can possibly be I mean does that not go 100% with human beings as well it's it's you know let your dog know that he can trust you And so I went and it took, you know, based on, and I can't blame Balbo, like based on what I told them naturally, they're assuming blast lung, you know, type type of issues, you know, some sort of, you know, explosive type of damage, but it wasn't, you know, what that did is it exacerbated what had already started, which was me having breed then, coccity in my coasts, which is a microscopic fungus that lives in, in air, climates and it spreads through your lungs like mold, where it gets dangerous and kills people is, it's two things. so it means more dogs is back to the book dogs respect confidence power to 40 and by dogs I mean all dogs I don't care how much of an alpha roll any dog is assumed when someone comes along who exhibits those three traits to a greater degree than they they will step aside with the exception of the the four of the two come across but you know those those are dogs that I can assure you that nobody on the in the 83 million dog on her pet spectrum have ever run into you know these are unicorns for sure what you do with those dogs bread bread some of them one of them was out on the west coast actually as a working dog just retired here not not too long ago if I had to pick probably the most gifted physically across the board dog I've ever come across it was a dog that was out there for several years that came in we put him through his first hand of course but but my point is is that you know you you have that that A plus B will see principle in everything you know it's whether it's shaping behavior that you desire it's eliminating undesirable problem behaviors that you've inadvertently created it's you know breaking breaking trust and and ruining relationships you know one of the things that I like to tell people and again it's with you know human relationships also is it trust is like a piece of paper but you know I I firmly believe you know what you want to call it a calling or whatever is that you know my goal is to revolutionize how your average everyday dog owner views communicates with and interacts with their dog because how many dogs a year gets sent to the pound 3.3 million dogs every year gets surrendered to to shelters across this country and it varies year to year but usually between six and six hundred and eighty and seven hundred and fifty thousand dogs a year get you the nays that's over two thousand dogs every day getting put to sleep in this country even at those numbers you know and I answer questions every Monday with with all the all the the members and people interact with each other and give each other advice and post videos and and a bunch of other stuff we're going to launch some affiliate partnership programs here with people get another people to sign up soon but that in conjunction with the book and then launching a tracos training franchises which are going to augment all of the people out there that are subscribers so basically you know it's working with certified dry-coast and team dog trainers all over the country that have these franchises everywhere that help you go through this monthly training curriculum and you know that the crux of it though is you know just like with anything you need help from some people you need guidance with learning Olympic lifts or jiu-jitsu moves whatever So the entire first Marine Division and seal team three echo of the two and took down to create and it was funny because they're like, you know, you know, first first division has the west, you know, seconds got the north, third's got the south and team three echo, but two and you guys were taking these, like, you know, there's 16 of us soft, soft skinned puppies, right? And then it's like, well, there's four guys and, you know, that we saw a couple of AKs and next thing, you know, it's like, there's 115 people and they're all suicide vested up and, you know, they're going to clap off when you guys step on, you know, it was just. yeah do you do you fill up the hard drive at some point where they can't learn anything new without forgetting something else not any more than any of us you know they can learn they can they will continue to learn and to me one of the reasons dogs as with people expire earlier than they probably need to is because a lack of of that stimulation that mental stimulation you know even if the mind or even if the body can't can't perform there's a lot other ways that you can get dogs to stimulate their mind and and keep them younger and healthier and happier than than just letting them expire on a dog bed you know five feet away from you letting your heart get too much in the way of your head and what's best for your dog will end up causing that heart more pain in the long run discipline equals freedom and if it's again if it's that big with people I mean you know you're the type of guy that you know you walk into a room people like this dudes run and run in the show right a lot of people you know that we've worked with or worked for our like that just command respect by the way they care themselves by the way they walk in. When the dog is scared, if you know different than if you have a child that's, you know, the third grade level, you know, when they walk into a classroom or they're sitting in the classroom in the teacher walks in and they blow their anal glands, you know, because they're getting ready to get whipped with rulers and, you know, electrocuted or God knows what else. so you got a guy Bob who whenever he's working on his car he loses temper goes crazy throws to us around he doesn't know why his dog doesn't you know like it back to the book when Bob lost his cool even though Bob didn't direct any of his anger at his dog Rudy the dog wanted no part of that scenario maybe we use more sensitive to those kind of responses than other dogs might have been but Rudy basically lost respect for Bob Bob was the guy he expected to be in command and in control and he wasn't what made things worse for Bob was that he knew that was the case so so at the reason I pulled that one out is because again I talk about all time if you lose your temper as a leader you're you're you're I'll get another thing you see this in relationships in companies where they just everyone is hiding this problem no one will address the problem no one's gonna address the problem so if you got problems default aggressive get aggressive find the solution to problem implement it that kind of wraps up this book like I said team dog is the name of the book how to train your dog the navy seal way and good stuff in there not just for dogs but for humans as well and Mike obviously appreciate your service and not only what you did when you're in the teams but everything you've done and did once you got out of the teams and thanks for coming on the podcast now I know you got a bunch of things going on right now yeah before undergoing formal training develop a bond of mutual trust and respect so get that relationship going before you demand a bunch of stuff from people become the authority figure in dog's life that he wants and needs take the time to be patient do multiple repetitions build in different levels of distraction and employ variable rewards schedules all to ensure that a concept is firmly embedded in dogs mind now we'll talk a little bit about jjitsu here you got to do the repetition and then you've got to do it in different you know you you got to you got to you got to arm lock you got to try an arm lock live rolling a hundred times before you get one at least a hundred maybe more and in order to shorten that time you got to do more drills but it's it's kind of like world world policy you know foreign policy from an international standpoint is it sometimes the simplest solutions are the best for the most complex problems you know foreign policy being a bar fight you know if if if you're gonna go walk into that bar you're gonna get in a fight you know we brought the dog in and we were staying at a local hotel there and it's eight week hand of course putting the dog through and my very first introduction to him is he was staying in the room with his hand and they'd spent some time together and had gone started the bond and it was like holiday and express they had free pizza and of course I'm like I'm not gonna pass up free pizza so I've got a paper plate with a couple of pieces of pie on it and I walk into the room the dog just kind of cocks his head looks at me runs over and literally like a dude like a team guy jumps up just slapped it right out of my hand and he leans down and starts eating it It doesn't work like like our minds and that's the biggest single crucial element where people make the mistakes is they anthropomorphize and they attach all these human associations, emotions, logic and reasoning to a dog's brain and it doesn't work that way, you know, the the A plus B equals C, you know, the scientific jargon is anti-cedent plus behavior equals consequence, but just think of it like a calculator is that. no thank you actually i'm where you were at with the dog thing where it's like hey we can't get a dog maybe we got to be ready to get a dog you know my daughter's looking to get a dog she didn't know she's fat you're not going to be a good dog owner and believe me I had to fight I got three daughters and one son and for the years of me beating them down saying no dog no dog no dog because I knew that I couldn't put enough time and effort into it to make it a dog have a good life and the dog be square away and be disciplined and be able to you know protect my family so it took a while to get there it's pretty clear to see the benefits that that has in terms of you know sniffing explosives that are buried and detecting people that are hidden in false floors and tracking people and things of that nature on the on the pet dog side where that comes into play is that is that same you know from a relationship standpoint is that they recognize you by the way you smell they recognize your kids by the way they smell in terms of of training interacting with them using treats rewards to always things that that nature at you know it plays big big dividends or pays big dividends too
