So that was like it that was a super difficult time and you know in part you sort of feel like you're letting your mentors down because a lot of people had invested a lot in me right Hopkins had taken me right year I was like one of the six chosen ones they only take six categoricals a year so now you're going to leave that program. They got bonuses like all these things happened that were a function of some of my brother was like you know he was like breaking every record at his law firm right like nobody could work as hard. Like you know, because you always feel that like, you know how likely you know you're gaining some weight or I mean a lot of times you know why you're gaining weight. I mean it was like being a kid in a candy store again because I got to go spend a whole summer in school again learning finance like learning all of these things that you know for some people might seem kind of drive but when you're like just dying to. Because, and Brian's one of these guys who's just, you know, he's just, he's like a Renaissance man, you know, like not only is a great surgeon, he's like a gifted artist. And I am pretty glad that I didn't have my first kid till I was 35, which on the one hand you sort of think, well, God, I'm so old, you know, like I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be like the 50-year-old grandfather, right? And I remember saying to like, you know the controller at this bank, I'm like, hey man, like it's going to be really hard to build you a model of losses when you don't have any historical losses. And I didn't want to leave California because, you know, four years in California, for the first time was, you know, when you know, you guys know what it's like. Like she was kind of like, you know, like all good leaders. I don't remember the exact stats but you're going to spend like you know 50 60% of your entire health care dollars and like the last year or two of your life I mean something as an I right Because like if you're in the military and you and I were working together, I would be like, hey Peter, you got to get, you got to get, you got to act like, what is it, what is it, whatever. So just through empirical testing in myself over the past year and a half, I've realized that an average blood glucose and this thing tells me every time I hit click, like it gives me my last 14 days, I just realized like for my average to be below 85 and my standard deviation to be below 10 is like super dialed in. And because I feel that way with all of my friends, like if Tim introduces me to somebody, like Tim's introduced me to like a dozen people, it doesn't amazing relationships have come out of that, right? And, you know, she's an example of someone who came in basically dead, but in situations like that, like, you know, I'm sure you can relate to this. But, you know, he knows that I'm not going to send him somebody that's not you know, going to be really interesting and going to benefit his listeners, not just, you know, whatever agenda that person might have. And you know, this would be like, if you asked the most junior guy, you know, to do something like, he, he'd be kicking his own ass to say yes. Like boom, I feel like when that happens, I feel like in lock on, there's almost no amount of sleep deprivation that will stop me from functioning and getting something done that's important on task, on time. And she's, you know, I mean, like, I gotta, I gotta sure hope I never have to know what she went through, because I can't, can't really imagine, right? They've gotten better now, you know, and some of those guys that committed horrible crimes, it, you know, kind of inspired the seal teams to step up that screening process as much as possible to make sure that we're not let guys through that are, that are deranged some way that are going to do something horrible like that. You know, if something's so strange, like not, you know, so I was like God damn it man. I don't know how to like, it's, you know, it's not like a war zone or anything. And there were you know a couple of attendings I'd become really close to who really believed in me and really said like you're going to you're going to do something really special and then to say actually I'm going to leave. Like I can pull an all nighter once a week, that's, you know, not that that's a good thing to do, but it was like kind of a confidence thing. But, you know, trauma patient, like you just wouldn't think to go to someone's funeral that you'd never known because like, I'd never known that boy, right? They could have figured out like, okay, the reason this person, like, acts like a lazy sack of shit is actually because of this. And and that's just one of many stories like that that happened through residency where I was like it's almost like we want to live in the 1950s here. You can almost guarantee that, you know, if she's living in where she's living, to get hit by a stray bullet, like, you know, she wasn't living in, you know, Roland Park. so I you know got a bunch of books on case interviews and I'd be sitting in the trauma bay waiting for bodies to come in I'd be like reading my cases you know case interview things before so that that's that was sort of the transition. I mean, but, but no, it's, yeah, you, you, you sort of like, you know, opiate's make you itch like crazy. Nobody could build as many hours like nobody could like crush it like he could and he was being rewarded for it now he ended up hating it he left he's now a public defender or he's prosecutor rather. So I started to, you know, even though it didn't seem like exercise, it wouldn't seem like exercise today at the time. oh my god like you know I remember the first time we learned what was called the efficient front here which is basically this differential equation that describes you know an investment philosophy. So the first observation is that when you look at a significant illness, like a completely disruptive insult, you know, cancer, you have pancreatic cancer, which means you're going to die, and you're going to die soon. And it was like, you know, Jockel is always like, yeah, 430. And so, you know, really it was just very easy for me to sort of take Kirk on his word that like, if Jocco's great guy, then that's all I need to know. I mean I could go after easier problems to solve where you can like you know get grants and you know just play the game and that's frankly what most people do in this space. And one sense the simplest organ in the body like it's really simple to understand what it's doing you know unlike the brain or the liver where it's just like.
