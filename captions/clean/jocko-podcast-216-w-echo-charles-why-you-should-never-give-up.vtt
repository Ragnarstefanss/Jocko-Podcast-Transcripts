00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.12
This is Jockel Pondcast number 216 with echo Charles and me, a Jockel Willick. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.92 --> 00:00:19.92
In attack, most daring, in defense, most cunning, in endurance, most steadfast. They performed

3
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:28.24
a few of arms which will be remembered and recounted as long as the virtues of courage and resolution

4
00:00:28.24 --> 00:00:40.000
have the power to move the hearts of men. And that right there is Winston Churchill speaking

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.12
in honor of the British First Airborne Division at honor and him. He was actually making that

6
00:00:49.12 --> 00:00:59.84
statement on September 22nd, 1944 in which the battle was not actually even over yet. And we did

7
00:00:59.84 --> 00:01:09.20
cover that faithful battle on podcast 94 from the book called Medit R. N. by Jeffrey Powell

8
00:01:09.20 --> 00:01:19.52
and it's just an incredible book and an account of the British Airborne Division in that battle

9
00:01:19.52 --> 00:01:31.04
where they lost almost 75% of its strength. And from that point on was for all practical purposes

10
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:42.72
out of the war. So who were these men that made this stand? We saw one when we covered Jeffrey

11
00:01:42.72 --> 00:01:54.56
Powell's book, but obviously there were thousands more each one of hero and also each one a

12
00:01:54.56 --> 00:02:04.80
a human being. And I recently got a book in the mail that someone sent me. The book was written

13
00:02:04.80 --> 00:02:12.000
by one such man, one such human being. The book is called The Memory In Durs and it was written by

14
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:29.52
a man named Reg Curtis. So let's go to this book and meet and learn and honor a hero of a human being.

15
00:02:31.20 --> 00:02:38.32
Here we go. Chapter one's called Pray Loot to War as a youth I carried out milk. I carried

16
00:02:38.32 --> 00:02:43.20
out a milk ground in the early morning and a newspaper around in the evening, earning four

17
00:02:43.20 --> 00:02:49.28
shillings a week, which helped towards the cost of the special clothing I needed as a choir boy

18
00:02:49.28 --> 00:02:57.44
at St Augustine's Church near Grove Park Railway Station. When I left school in 1934 at the age of

19
00:02:57.44 --> 00:03:04.24
14, I got a job at Elliott Brothers and Electrical and Mechanical Engineers firm in Lusham.

20
00:03:04.24 --> 00:03:10.64
I cycled five miles to and from work Monday to Saturday and learned quickly under the

21
00:03:10.64 --> 00:03:17.20
washful eye of the charge hand learning how to operate a milling machine, center lathe, hydraulic

22
00:03:17.20 --> 00:03:24.80
press and finally working as a captain, a center operator. I had to just read that part because

23
00:03:25.60 --> 00:03:30.80
you know you always hear about the old man who had to go five miles to work in five mile home

24
00:03:30.80 --> 00:03:39.44
uphill both ways. There you go. There you go. Redg Curtis was doing it. After three years I was

25
00:03:39.44 --> 00:03:44.72
beginning to set and by the way he's like 14 years old at this time just a kind of FYI. So

26
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.52
after three years I was beginning to settle in for a long-term job when a series of small

27
00:03:51.52 --> 00:04:00.72
strikes put the damper on my enthusiasm. The persistent industrial action prompted my decision

28
00:04:00.72 --> 00:04:06.24
to join the army where such strikes were not tolerated. You kind of get the impression this is

29
00:04:06.24 --> 00:04:12.88
odd guy, right? He's there having strikes whatever he says where where where can I go where that's

30
00:04:12.88 --> 00:04:18.56
not going to happen. Oh I know the army. My father had been in the Royal Army Service Corps and my

31
00:04:18.56 --> 00:04:23.84
grandfather was the chairman of the Royal British Legion so the army seemed natural enough in my

32
00:04:23.84 --> 00:04:30.08
family. I was encouraged by my uncle Fred himself a regimental sergeant major. I chose the footguards

33
00:04:30.08 --> 00:04:35.52
because after a short-term of service I would be acceptable to the city of London police. In those

34
00:04:35.52 --> 00:04:40.48
days you had to be at least five and five feet ten and a half inches tall to be a policeman.

35
00:04:41.52 --> 00:04:47.60
I was already six one and still growing. I presented myself to the guards recruiting office in London

36
00:04:47.60 --> 00:04:55.92
and enlisted with the first or grenadier regiment of the footguards. And flowing forward a little bit

37
00:04:55.92 --> 00:05:01.92
that there was one corporal Tucker. So now he's you know going through the boot camp scenario.

38
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:08.96
There was one corporal Tucker. My squad instructor who took great delight in marching us on

39
00:05:08.96 --> 00:05:15.28
to the frozen parade ground with extra zest. Then put us on a charge if we slipped up.

40
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:21.20
So you not only received a sore rump but also got extra parade as punishment. Another approach

41
00:05:21.20 --> 00:05:26.72
was to march us toward a large puddle and then give the order to mark time. Come on knees higher.

42
00:05:26.72 --> 00:05:32.08
He would shout from a safe distance, scrutinizing each man and turn and looking for any signs of cracking.

43
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:36.56
We were just numbers at Caterham.

44
00:05:38.24 --> 00:05:45.36
Though this day I say it did me no harm as it instilled a self-discipline that has served me well

45
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:50.96
through life. That's what you're going to get. And you know you and I were talking earlier about

46
00:05:50.96 --> 00:05:57.76
basically normal face. Basically look I'm not going to show that this is not fun. I'm not going

47
00:05:57.76 --> 00:06:06.32
to show. And you were saying that you learn if you say look no factor right? No factor. I got to do

48
00:06:06.32 --> 00:06:10.16
this hard thing. No factor. Not hey I got to do this hard thing so I'm going to get mentally

49
00:06:10.16 --> 00:06:17.84
all fired up. No no just no factor. And you learn over time that saying no factor keeping it in your

50
00:06:17.84 --> 00:06:23.68
head actually you get better at it. And all of a sudden hard things you just go I'm just going to do it.

51
00:06:23.68 --> 00:06:29.12
I'm just going to attack it. That's one of the things that this type of military training does.

52
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:35.36
And even he's saying look the stuff that this guy's going to go through is a thousand times harder

53
00:06:35.36 --> 00:06:40.72
than doing mark time march on the parade ground for an hour. Thousands of times harder infinitely

54
00:06:40.72 --> 00:06:48.16
harder. But there's a little less in that he learned. And plus he's British right? And the Brits

55
00:06:48.16 --> 00:06:54.32
with the stiff upper lip that's that's like a whole culture at least it used to be because the

56
00:06:54.32 --> 00:07:00.56
culture's changed a lot and Britain but this warrior culture of hey they're literally England

57
00:07:00.56 --> 00:07:05.20
if you think about it the stiff upper lip which is hey we're just going to go do that's that's the

58
00:07:05.20 --> 00:07:11.20
no factor culture of hey we got something to do cool we're going to go do it watch this with this is

59
00:07:11.20 --> 00:07:16.32
England what do we got we got some hard for us cool no factor step up or let move forward.

60
00:07:19.12 --> 00:07:24.56
Fast for in a little bit so he gets like one of his first jobs is is sort of

61
00:07:25.28 --> 00:07:33.68
guarding the the royal family and so he does some of that and then moves on to kind of the regular

62
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:39.04
army going back to look soon enough I left the glamour of Windsor and the comfort of

63
00:07:39.04 --> 00:07:45.20
Victoria Barracks behind it was sent to pair bright in Surrey where every guard's men goes

64
00:07:45.20 --> 00:07:51.44
for field work craft and firing on the open range it was my duty to be able to handle and fire

65
00:07:51.44 --> 00:07:57.28
a gun in preparation to protect King and Country in an emergency but trust my luck to a fallen

66
00:07:57.28 --> 00:08:04.96
fall and fall of bad weather it was not really my cup of tea to prostrate myself on a wet

67
00:08:04.96 --> 00:08:09.60
and windstrip flying right range with a sergeant breathing down my neck whispering words of encouragement

68
00:08:09.60 --> 00:08:15.20
and added supply of rainwater running over me in torrents from his ground sheet cape

69
00:08:16.88 --> 00:08:21.28
this is this is not the way you'd hear a US Marine described.

70
00:08:21.28 --> 00:08:27.52
Being on the range in a rainy day you know that's such a British way of explaining this and then

71
00:08:27.52 --> 00:08:33.68
he continues on it must have done some good as I made first class shot though for what purpose I was not yet

72
00:08:33.68 --> 00:08:38.80
sure so guess what this is supposed to world war one I think I want to say this is 1939 when he

73
00:08:38.80 --> 00:08:44.64
enlisted so there's maybe 30 maybe 38 actually I think it's 37 yeah 1937 he joined the army

74
00:08:44.64 --> 00:08:52.08
so there's you know world war one was what 20 years in the past that was the war to end all wars

75
00:08:52.08 --> 00:08:57.60
sure there's a guy in Germany that might begin a little up at he but he's saying hey look I

76
00:08:57.60 --> 00:09:01.28
know I gotta learn how to use this gun but not really sure what I need to know how to do this for

77
00:09:04.48 --> 00:09:09.68
continuing on fast-forward a little bit in early in 1939 I was transferred to the home of the

78
00:09:09.68 --> 00:09:15.92
British Army at Aldershot in Hampshire I'll never forget the atmosphere of the night of the tattoo

79
00:09:15.92 --> 00:09:22.08
which tattoo is like a word for a parade basically when our battalion marched on dressed in navy blue

80
00:09:22.08 --> 00:09:29.28
trousers with red piping down the out seam outside out seam of each trouser leg long-sleeved

81
00:09:29.28 --> 00:09:34.88
white wader type jackets with brass buttons and the guards peaked cap with red band around the crown

82
00:09:34.88 --> 00:09:40.56
carried out without a word of command our drilled display lasted for 20 minutes the finale being

83
00:09:40.56 --> 00:09:46.32
the only time a command was given the battalion will advance in review order by the entire by the

84
00:09:46.32 --> 00:09:54.72
center quick march 450 men moved his one and the reason I had that once again when you just think

85
00:09:54.72 --> 00:10:03.36
about human beings right psychologically in that moment look you're a cog in the wheel that's all you

86
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:10.88
are you're a pawn on the chessboard that's all you are but and he and he says it

87
00:10:11.92 --> 00:10:19.84
like that feeling that you get of being a part of something that's literally bigger than you are

88
00:10:19.84 --> 00:10:24.40
hey I'm just I'm just a guy out here in a uniform but there's 450 of us moving as one

89
00:10:25.44 --> 00:10:31.36
and there's some part of human instinct that likes to be a part of that tribe

90
00:10:31.36 --> 00:10:41.44
ummm continue on in August some mysterious goings on began unusual apparatus in the form of

91
00:10:41.44 --> 00:10:46.80
digging equipment both powered and hand operated appeared along with wheel barrels and mountains of

92
00:10:46.80 --> 00:10:52.000
little sacks which turned out to be sandbags lorries loaded this lorries loaded with sand

93
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.88
would dump their contents at various points and instead of the usual drill parades and kit inspections

94
00:10:56.88 --> 00:11:01.92
we found ourselves filling these bags with sand and building barriers I thought it must be some

95
00:11:01.92 --> 00:11:06.72
sort of giant exercise and had no idea that it was in preparation for real enemy

96
00:11:07.52 --> 00:11:13.20
being confined to the barracks with its own shops and theater we didn't mix with the public

97
00:11:13.20 --> 00:11:18.48
so new very little ball matters of national importance indeed in those days the serviceman was

98
00:11:18.48 --> 00:11:23.84
not allowed to discuss politics and we would put on charge if caught attending a political meeting

99
00:11:23.84 --> 00:11:29.60
so these guys are completely isolated and I'm thinking about even when I joined the navy and

100
00:11:29.60 --> 00:11:34.40
we go on a ship we didn't know idea what's going on there's no internet yet and so we had no

101
00:11:34.40 --> 00:11:40.80
idea what was going on in the outside world and even even living on base I mean you at least

102
00:11:40.80 --> 00:11:46.56
when even when I joined you had key cable news right you knew that the CNN was on and you're watching

103
00:11:46.56 --> 00:11:53.68
CNN and you're knowing what's going on in the world there's no CNN there's no TV there's nothing

104
00:11:53.68 --> 00:11:57.20
so these guys are completely isolated they're living the all the stores are going to are on base

105
00:11:57.20 --> 00:12:01.52
the theaters on base so there's living on base paying no mind to what's going on overseas

106
00:12:02.08 --> 00:12:07.60
what does put on charge means getting trouble just in general yeah just in general like oh he

107
00:12:07.60 --> 00:12:12.96
got in trouble yeah okay so it's not like a you know because it's varying levels of you

108
00:12:12.96 --> 00:12:17.92
you're trying to any covers and he I'm glad you brought that up because it's he uses it throughout

109
00:12:17.92 --> 00:12:21.52
kind of the book because there's you get you can get one on charge for all kinds of stuff yeah

110
00:12:21.52 --> 00:12:28.08
and so it's just a general term that means being in trouble maybe written up maybe sent to the

111
00:12:28.08 --> 00:12:32.80
brig for a little time whatever but you know you got put on charge yeah no court martial

112
00:12:32.80 --> 00:12:37.52
nothing like this but could be you keep it up yeah if you well it could be too you like if you

113
00:12:37.52 --> 00:12:41.92
did something really bad you just got okay you know he's gonna get put on charge okay yeah I got

114
00:12:41.92 --> 00:12:46.80
you and yes is any level of trouble is what I perceive to this maybe a brick military

115
00:12:46.80 --> 00:12:55.52
person will let us know if I'm wrong continue on on the third of September war was declared

116
00:12:55.52 --> 00:13:03.04
with Germany and I realized what all the sandbagging was for within days my battalion was mobilized

117
00:13:03.04 --> 00:13:09.12
reservists were called up and along with thousands of other troops two weeks later two weeks

118
00:13:09.12 --> 00:13:17.36
later we were in France I think I was quite unperturbed at the possibility of getting killed after

119
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:23.20
all I was a soldier trained to kill so why should I have any qualms you know what's nuts about this

120
00:13:24.24 --> 00:13:30.72
and I mean putting into perspective world war one which was now 20 years at hindsight was so

121
00:13:30.72 --> 00:13:41.04
insanely savage and yet this guy still regges like yeah you know what cool I'm not worried about

122
00:13:41.04 --> 00:13:49.28
getting killed I'm a soldier and you think about the casualties in World War one had to be

123
00:13:49.28 --> 00:13:57.68
had you had to beat it shows you it shows you how quickly we can forget right what war is

124
00:13:57.68 --> 00:14:02.24
because if you witnessed a day on the battlefield and World War one there's no way you'd want to do

125
00:14:02.24 --> 00:14:11.84
any of that ever again but whatever your 20 years old you're crack shot with that rifle

126
00:14:13.36 --> 00:14:18.08
time to go get some continue on in the forward positions we oh yeah and by the way now I'm just

127
00:14:18.08 --> 00:14:23.12
jumping past hey they get there and by the way like I said they get to France two weeks later

128
00:14:23.12 --> 00:14:29.84
this isn't like okay we're doing a prolonged preparation no we're declaring war on the third

129
00:14:29.84 --> 00:14:36.32
and in September the third of September we're declaring war and then in September two weeks later

130
00:14:36.32 --> 00:14:42.08
you're on the ground in France ready to get some in the forward positions so now they they start

131
00:14:42.08 --> 00:14:47.04
moving forward from France in the forward positions we took over deserted village called

132
00:14:47.04 --> 00:14:51.44
Tromborn about six miles from the German border as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided

133
00:14:51.44 --> 00:14:56.32
to make use of sheets to create so they're in these areas that are pretty much abandoned

134
00:14:56.32 --> 00:15:00.40
and so they're going into houses and finding stuff as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided

135
00:15:00.40 --> 00:15:05.12
to make use of sheets to create sets of camouflage gear white suits gloves over boots hats and

136
00:15:05.12 --> 00:15:10.24
coverings for rifles hunting around we've I found a sewing machine thinking that we might as well

137
00:15:10.24 --> 00:15:16.32
do things the easy way as a fighting patrol we didn't fire a shot there's more matter of

138
00:15:16.32 --> 00:15:20.32
listening and night reconnaissance in our white outfits carrying only rifles and are

139
00:15:20.32 --> 00:15:25.28
limited other gear we traveled more comfortably than we had previously which I skipped over the

140
00:15:25.28 --> 00:15:32.16
part where they're basically doing long long movements to get into positions on one night reconnaissance

141
00:15:32.16 --> 00:15:38.40
we became over confident don't what that happened and one of our lads knocked up against the enemy

142
00:15:38.40 --> 00:15:45.68
wire it was a still bright moonlit night we were in no man's land just 75 feet from the forward

143
00:15:45.68 --> 00:15:51.44
German positions they're talking of stop to abruptly as luck would have it we were crawling so we

144
00:15:51.44 --> 00:15:57.04
froze hugging the ground for an hour without moving on another occasion we were on our way back

145
00:15:57.04 --> 00:16:03.20
to base when from and by the way on that one they they make it out on another occasion we were on

146
00:16:03.20 --> 00:16:07.04
our way back to base when from the direction of a bend in the road 50 yards away we saw a group of

147
00:16:07.04 --> 00:16:12.08
figures we were about two miles from our lines and knew that no other patrols were out so these

148
00:16:12.08 --> 00:16:17.28
men must be the enemy our patrol leader gave the signal a lie still we were straddled each side of the

149
00:16:17.28 --> 00:16:23.36
road in semi-open ground but fortunately the night was not too bright the group passed by

150
00:16:23.36 --> 00:16:29.20
ten men in all spaced six to eight feet apart they were well-armed but war no white suits

151
00:16:29.20 --> 00:16:35.52
keeping them in view and moving only our eyes we lay unnoticed if we had been spotted they would have

152
00:16:35.52 --> 00:16:41.20
had the advantage because of their automatic weapons and also the fact that they as they passed

153
00:16:41.20 --> 00:16:48.32
down our center we could not have fired on them for fear of hitting our own men never separate your

154
00:16:48.32 --> 00:16:52.56
forces which is hard when you're walking down a road because when you're walking down a road you're

155
00:16:52.56 --> 00:16:56.64
going to be in a what's called a staggered file which means you got guys on either side of the road

156
00:16:56.64 --> 00:17:01.68
right which generally we're trying to stay off the roads anyways but sometimes that road is the

157
00:17:01.68 --> 00:17:04.56
smartest place to move you're going to make a bunch of noise moving through the brush and you can

158
00:17:04.56 --> 00:17:08.80
get on that road and move really quietly so it's something that can happen but then when they see

159
00:17:08.80 --> 00:17:12.96
the enemy they all get off the road what's the quickest way to get off the road it's on the

160
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:16.48
room side that you're on and what does that mean you're on both sides of the road now in the

161
00:17:16.48 --> 00:17:21.76
enemy walks in between you and you start shooting at the enemy you're actually shooting each other

162
00:17:22.96 --> 00:17:32.32
so you have to be cognizant of that which these guys were continuing on when I came into contact

163
00:17:32.32 --> 00:17:36.08
with two Germans and this is another thing about this book the first of all this book is not

164
00:17:36.08 --> 00:17:42.96
very long but the other thing that's that's crazy and British and no factor and stuff up a lip

165
00:17:42.96 --> 00:17:51.44
is he'll he'll describe the most insane things that were factually crazy as like in three sentences

166
00:17:51.44 --> 00:17:57.28
of what and just really matter a fact you know so although there are times where he

167
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.32
definitely adds some color but that's the way he is just just kind of matter fact very British about

168
00:18:04.32 --> 00:18:09.04
the whole thing when I came into contact with the two Germans for the first time myself I gave them

169
00:18:09.04 --> 00:18:14.16
five rounds of rapid fire to range of 50 yards as they edge towards me under the cover of garden

170
00:18:14.16 --> 00:18:19.92
walls and fencing they were my first shots in anger I didn't see the two Germans anymore so maybe

171
00:18:19.92 --> 00:18:25.44
they were lucky shots guardsman baitman and Elm's doubled past and shattered for me to come

172
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:30.88
on and we continued into open country making our way over to a bridge and halting roughly after

173
00:18:30.88 --> 00:18:37.28
roughly a thousand yards where we took up defensive positions air activity was increasingly

174
00:18:37.28 --> 00:18:43.84
tremendous measurement one-on-ones were machine gunning at low level and had strafed our troops

175
00:18:43.84 --> 00:18:51.28
coming over the bridge only a few minutes after I crossed there's these these talking about these

176
00:18:51.28 --> 00:18:58.88
and I I don't know if I just never really thought about it this much detail but he talks about these

177
00:18:58.88 --> 00:19:04.16
you know the enemy aircraft coming in at low level and strafing them all the time and if you

178
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:10.80
were seeing a measure Schmidt they're just really bad ass looking aircraft and a lot of the

179
00:19:10.80 --> 00:19:15.44
German aircraft they just were I mean all the aircraft back then right I mean you got spit fires you

180
00:19:15.44 --> 00:19:21.28
got corsairs you got mustang you got a p-38 line but you got awesome looking aircraft that and if you

181
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:28.72
can imagine this too at that time those were the most technologically advanced things right

182
00:19:28.72 --> 00:19:36.32
so they didn't look they didn't look old right they looked like a x-wing fighter from star wars

183
00:19:36.32 --> 00:19:40.88
right that's what you were seeing you were seeing this magical machine that was just

184
00:19:41.76 --> 00:19:49.60
and now this thing is pointing at you at an altitude of like 300 or 400 feet and just dumping

185
00:19:49.60 --> 00:19:55.20
machine gun rounds at you and can you imagine the noise that they make with those big giant engines I mean

186
00:19:55.20 --> 00:20:03.28
yeah and so he talks about that a lot in these books and that's kind of the first encounter that

187
00:20:03.28 --> 00:20:08.56
he brings it up the other thing that scares me about it is it's sort of random you know it's

188
00:20:08.56 --> 00:20:13.52
almost like mortar fire because the aircraft's gonna come down if it's pointed two degrees in

189
00:20:13.52 --> 00:20:18.48
that direction you're fine if it points two degrees in your direction your dead and the rounds are

190
00:20:18.48 --> 00:20:24.48
hitting you know at a spacing of six feet or whatever when they get through ground so if you're

191
00:20:24.48 --> 00:20:29.36
in between those two six feet you're totally fine or you get hitting the face or in the head

192
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:36.56
and you're dead so there's this element of chance going on as well which I never like

193
00:20:36.56 --> 00:20:43.36
I never liked that element of chance continuing on leaving the area and traveling mainly on foot

194
00:20:43.36 --> 00:20:48.88
encountering few enemy on the ground but experiencing continuous shelling and bombing from the air

195
00:20:48.88 --> 00:20:56.32
we came to a stop by the river Asuka near the city of Tornai six miles from the French border

196
00:20:56.32 --> 00:21:03.28
here we went into a counterattack during which a very well-liked platoon commander Lutenette the Duke

197
00:21:03.28 --> 00:21:09.44
of Northumberland was killed Lance Corporal Harry Nichols and guardsmen Nash were ordered to

198
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:15.52
flush out some bothersome machine gun as 600 yards from our position that's British right you're

199
00:21:15.52 --> 00:21:23.76
going to describe machine gun as as bothersome the section I was in gave covering fire

200
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:29.60
what what what what is that all about yeah that's called cover move fundamental to our left

201
00:21:29.60 --> 00:21:33.84
they picked their way with caution Nichols and a light machine gun under each arm

202
00:21:33.84 --> 00:21:38.56
Nichols with a light machine gun under each arm I didn't see them anymore but they must have

203
00:21:38.56 --> 00:21:42.96
completed the mission because there were because the enemy fire ceased after a while Lance

204
00:21:42.96 --> 00:21:48.72
Corporal Nichols was posted missing presumed killed but later reported as being alive in enemy hands

205
00:21:48.72 --> 00:21:54.24
he was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action in the semi-built up area on the river the

206
00:21:54.24 --> 00:22:01.20
Germans afforded very good target practice for me I found that I just could not miss but we were all

207
00:22:01.20 --> 00:22:05.84
getting weary through lack of sleep and proper food no one can live off scraps or from scavenging

208
00:22:05.84 --> 00:22:12.000
for long without feeling the worst for it and enemy numbers were increasing tenfold or so it seemed

209
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:18.48
continuing on we came to another stop this was the last time I took part in a coordinated attack

210
00:22:18.48 --> 00:22:23.44
with the third battalion grendendier guards we went into a bayonet charge

211
00:22:26.88 --> 00:22:30.80
I say again we went into a bayonet charge at court to cure

212
00:22:30.80 --> 00:22:38.80
setting off I felt very scared and all sorts of things went through my mind like what the hell

213
00:22:38.80 --> 00:22:46.80
am I doing here oh yes I joined the army to become a policeman want a laugh the muck was flying fast

214
00:22:46.80 --> 00:22:54.56
bullets winding and splattering and I crouch lower to dodge them all I went with the rest my 16

215
00:22:54.56 --> 00:23:00.24
inch and field bayonet blade fixed and protruding at the ready ready ready for what the only thing I

216
00:23:00.24 --> 00:23:07.76
had ever stuck with a bayonet was a sack dummy then I saw them in the swirling smoke human beings

217
00:23:07.76 --> 00:23:15.84
not sacks real Germans blimey I trouched on wrenching my ankle in a pot hole on and on until the

218
00:23:15.84 --> 00:23:25.52
order rang out charge charge I began to double now with my bayonet thrust at full on guard

219
00:23:25.52 --> 00:23:31.44
those figures growing bigger and bigger until they were just a few yards away among the din

220
00:23:31.44 --> 00:23:37.52
and yells of pain there were dead bodies from both sides littering my approach I was a foot from

221
00:23:37.52 --> 00:23:43.68
the two Germans went suddenly they both dropped their rifles and reached very high chattering

222
00:23:43.68 --> 00:23:50.56
something about comrad I was so bloody amazed and relieved that I said come on then I'll take you

223
00:23:50.56 --> 00:23:58.08
prisoner which is just that paragraph for me to think through because I'm thinking when I see

224
00:23:58.08 --> 00:24:03.76
those Germans you know what I'm doing I'm shooting them right I'm not going to continue with the

225
00:24:03.76 --> 00:24:14.000
bayonet charge right I'm not expecting to take these guys prisoner my battalion was now badly

226
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.68
cut up and he used the term cut up meaning shot up meaning wounded injured he used that throughout

227
00:24:19.68 --> 00:24:25.52
the book with numbers well below effective fighting power and we were ordered to attach ourselves to

228
00:24:25.52 --> 00:24:32.08
any unit and make our way to done Kirk though no reason was given and here I was stuck with two

229
00:24:32.08 --> 00:24:36.96
German prisoners the journey was nerve-racking with hordes of refugees jamming the roads and making

230
00:24:36.96 --> 00:24:42.64
military transport movement almost impossible lorries guns in French aged 39 hotchkes tanks were

231
00:24:42.64 --> 00:24:50.72
off and seen abandoned inditches rendered imoval but clearly not by enemy action what was going on

232
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:56.88
were we throwing in the towel so he's seen all these abandoned vehicles and they're being destroyed

233
00:24:56.88 --> 00:25:02.24
by friendly forces only because we don't want the enemy to get ahold of our tanks and he's

234
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:05.52
trying to figure out what's going on and obviously anyone that knows anything about history knows

235
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:12.96
that they're heading for done Kirk to leave the route was an absolute shambles with military

236
00:25:12.96 --> 00:25:17.12
and civilian gear constantly getting estranged rumors were plentiful now such as the story

237
00:25:17.12 --> 00:25:24.08
that leapled third of geard of Belgium and his army were capitulating towns all over France were falling

238
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:30.16
into enemy hands French general jiraud had been taken prisoner to pile on the agony the

239
00:25:30.16 --> 00:25:34.48
Germans not lit up on their bombing or machine gunning one bit and their slaughter of refugees was

240
00:25:34.48 --> 00:25:41.60
unnecessary and sickening to see we did what we could in the way of tending to civilian wounded

241
00:25:41.60 --> 00:25:46.96
using their own clothing or bedding for bandages while their dead were either left covered

242
00:25:46.96 --> 00:25:52.32
left or covered with something to hide their torn bodies and agonized faces even cattle grazing

243
00:25:52.32 --> 00:25:57.60
in the fields had not escaped the bullets Craig and lay bloated through lack of milking or blown

244
00:25:57.60 --> 00:26:03.84
apart by shell fire the carnage spread for a good two miles after seeing those poor

245
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:09.20
wretched civilian so caught up my occasional wounded soldier the occasional wounded soldier did

246
00:26:09.20 --> 00:26:16.000
not seem quite so bad my two German prisoners appeared to be as disgusted by all of this as I was

247
00:26:17.44 --> 00:26:21.52
and you're gonna see throughout this book the impression that he gets of the German as you

248
00:26:21.52 --> 00:26:30.40
could see that there's definitely a wide range of Germans that they encounter obviously some

249
00:26:30.40 --> 00:26:38.40
completely hostile but there's some that clearly are not are not totally engaged in the Nazi

250
00:26:39.28 --> 00:26:44.80
attitude and there's plenty there's it's very interesting to hear as he interacts with people throughout it

251
00:26:46.32 --> 00:26:50.72
continue on we reach the outskirts of Dunkirk to find a mass build up a French and British

252
00:26:50.72 --> 00:26:54.96
soldiers with transport tanks and artillery pieces jamming the roads like a London rush hour

253
00:26:56.96 --> 00:27:02.88
the next five days were a mixture of hell, hunger and fatigue and I think it was only thanks to

254
00:27:02.88 --> 00:27:08.88
the fatigue that I overcame the hell and the hunger I know it was five days because I put a

255
00:27:08.88 --> 00:27:14.72
nick in my rifle butt each morning when roused by this visiting stucco's and mishrschmits so they're

256
00:27:14.72 --> 00:27:19.84
getting bombed and they're getting machine gunned every morning during daylight the appointed beach

257
00:27:19.84 --> 00:27:24.72
master a British officer mustard officers and NCOs from all regiments and brief them to organize

258
00:27:24.72 --> 00:27:31.04
parties of men to tend to wounded bury the dead and scavenge for ammunition and food I found it most

259
00:27:31.04 --> 00:27:38.08
distasteful removing tins of bully beef and biscuit remains from corpses but at least I still had my life

260
00:27:39.12 --> 00:27:44.08
the beach was littered with abandoned lorries and trucks as well as army staff cars with wheels

261
00:27:44.08 --> 00:27:49.44
missing and doors hanging off as I wandered around going about my task among these mutilated

262
00:27:49.44 --> 00:27:55.84
forms that were once carefree young men I remember thinking that I must be dreaming

263
00:27:57.76 --> 00:28:03.12
I was brought back to reality sharply by the appearance of two enemy fighter plans which proceeded

264
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:08.64
to distribute even more death in panic I dived over a corpse and slithered down a sand dune

265
00:28:08.64 --> 00:28:21.36
the staring eyes of the corpse saying to me get your head down and rs up after five days on the

266
00:28:21.36 --> 00:28:25.76
beaches it was a relief to find that it was finally my turn to get into the snake like line

267
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:33.04
of troops ready for departure as I drew closer to the vast mass of a ship a mine sweeper

268
00:28:33.04 --> 00:28:39.20
heaving in the mucky looking swell I could see it's multi-barrel attack gun porting skyward

269
00:28:39.20 --> 00:28:44.80
in readiness for any stucophyters or attack or fighter attack the operator seeming oblivious to

270
00:28:44.80 --> 00:28:49.68
our presence one was scanning the sky with his binoculars the water was by now was well and truly

271
00:28:49.68 --> 00:28:54.64
up to my neck and I still had 50 feet to go I clung the rope with both hands and pushed on

272
00:28:54.64 --> 00:28:59.92
the man behind gave me a shove the water kept lapping over my nose and into my eyes

273
00:28:59.92 --> 00:29:05.84
gulping choking and spitting out the endless mouthfuls of oily, foul tasting salt water I was

274
00:29:05.84 --> 00:29:11.20
now quite submerged with a last mighty effort I lunched in the direction of the boat still

275
00:29:11.20 --> 00:29:16.48
grasping at that rope I could not have been it could not have been more than a minute that I was

276
00:29:16.48 --> 00:29:21.52
underwater but it felt like a lifetime clinging on tight to the rope with my left hand with my

277
00:29:21.52 --> 00:29:26.56
right I grew up through the rope mesh hanging down the side of the ship and with great exaltation

278
00:29:26.56 --> 00:29:33.68
found and grabbed it I managed to pull myself up up up and up the ship rocking and heaving with

279
00:29:33.68 --> 00:29:38.08
each vibration of the exploding bombs which were arriving much too close for my liking

280
00:29:40.56 --> 00:29:44.56
so finally he's on board a ship and they're getting bombed and strafed flopping down

281
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:48.96
exhausted I was soon asleep though inevitably we had a visitor visit from a meshishment

282
00:29:48.96 --> 00:29:53.92
and this woke me violently as its bullets danced along the ship's deck causing large pieces

283
00:29:53.92 --> 00:29:59.92
of wood splinters to spew over everyone these administrators as much damage as the bullets to some

284
00:29:59.92 --> 00:30:06.88
unfortunate recipients I dosed off again and slept like a log until we docked in England

285
00:30:08.16 --> 00:30:14.64
so ended my participation with more than 300,000 others in operation dynamo better known as the

286
00:30:14.64 --> 00:30:21.44
history better known history as the miracle of Dunkirk so that's the way you kick things off

287
00:30:21.44 --> 00:30:27.36
with your with your war and I forget the time that passed and I know that the time that

288
00:30:27.36 --> 00:30:32.64
seemed to pass was very quick the way I just read it skipping a bunch of stuff but it was like

289
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:37.44
200 days that he was on the ground this was no hey I was there for a week no they were there

290
00:30:37.44 --> 00:30:44.000
moving forward fighting drawing back going on tack back and forth this whole time and you know that

291
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.48
could be you know just that experience right there could be a whole book and it yeah on into itself

292
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:56.24
right that's how that's how low key red skirt is is you know he was literally

293
00:30:56.24 --> 00:31:05.52
extracted off of Dunkirk after this entire campaign falls apart and he covers it in 20 pages

294
00:31:05.52 --> 00:31:17.76
not even 20 pages because he's getting warmed up so he gets home and he says they're followed

295
00:31:17.76 --> 00:31:23.60
two weeks of leave that I enjoyed more than ever before the sheer ecstasy of white sheets and

296
00:31:23.60 --> 00:31:31.20
pint after pint of beautiful beer and the days of roughing it in France seemed soon

297
00:31:31.20 --> 00:31:37.28
seemed very long ago yeah can you gotta you gotta think how hard it's like when you're going

298
00:31:37.28 --> 00:31:42.48
through basic seal training mm-hmm what they do is they I don't know how weak you've been awake

299
00:31:42.48 --> 00:31:47.44
for like two or three days and then they go hey they come up with this big story and they tell you

300
00:31:47.44 --> 00:31:52.32
that oh you're gonna we've we've kept you we were too hard on you guys we we have the the

301
00:31:52.32 --> 00:31:56.88
commanding officer just told us we got to we got to put you guys to sleep for eight hours so go get

302
00:31:56.88 --> 00:32:01.52
warm dry clothes on and we'll come back to you guys and we'll wake you up in eight hours and you're

303
00:32:01.52 --> 00:32:04.96
of course you believe it I mean back in the day we believed because we didn't know any better no

304
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:10.64
one gave us any heads up there was no in for intel network providing information there wasn't

305
00:32:10.64 --> 00:32:15.84
there wasn't like the movies about the stuff right so we just thought oh wow that seems

306
00:32:15.84 --> 00:32:21.28
kind of crazy but okay and then you get all dressed nice warm clothes and you're all dry and you go

307
00:32:21.28 --> 00:32:26.80
even go literally get in your bed and then as soon as you fall asleep like 20 minutes goes by

308
00:32:26.80 --> 00:32:31.28
and they're in there with machine guns and bull horns and they're waking you up so when you think

309
00:32:31.28 --> 00:32:37.04
about that's that's retiny right that's a tiny tiny little thing when you compare to what's going

310
00:32:37.04 --> 00:32:45.20
on here this guy goes to France starving like wounded and dead everywhere fear gets back to England

311
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:56.000
goes on leave for two weeks white sheets you know beer it's all good and then you know what's

312
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.52
gonna happen you're gonna go back so when you when they did that to you uh in was that hell

313
00:33:03.52 --> 00:33:10.48
week and they did okay so before there was before there was like a network right I say

314
00:33:10.48 --> 00:33:14.88
that and you said you believed it like one they say oh we put you right was there a part of

315
00:33:14.88 --> 00:33:20.000
you mine like or as far as part of the reason why you believed it it's because like they are pushing

316
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.68
you pretty hard at any point were you like hey they're pushing us too hard yeah actually I

317
00:33:25.68 --> 00:33:29.28
thought what you're gonna say is was there part of my mom and this would have been I would

318
00:33:29.28 --> 00:33:33.68
said yes was there part of my mind was like this is too good to be true this is nothing that's

319
00:33:33.68 --> 00:33:37.68
you know that that I would say the bigger part of my mind was saying that but I kind of was like

320
00:33:37.68 --> 00:33:43.28
oh I seems like a cool like they're they're telling us this right but no no before that though

321
00:33:43.76 --> 00:33:48.96
like at any point where they like I know hell or were you or whoever being like I know how

322
00:33:48.96 --> 00:33:54.40
weeks supposed to be hard but like this is kind of excessive like yeah I had no data on which to

323
00:33:54.40 --> 00:34:00.48
judge it right you know it's gonna be hard you know soccer no guy that quit buds and I said you know

324
00:34:00.48 --> 00:34:05.84
like why did you quit and he said because it sucked you know I said well didn't you know that

325
00:34:05.84 --> 00:34:09.68
it was gonna suck when you went there I mean that's where you're going like we all know it sucks

326
00:34:10.40 --> 00:34:15.28
go watch it a video you know and it's like it's gonna be it's gonna suck it's gonna be cold

327
00:34:15.28 --> 00:34:21.92
it's gonna be wet it's gonna be miserable it just feels like that yeah it's gonna suck like that

328
00:34:21.92 --> 00:34:26.40
part but then you know like it goes sometimes in your brain anyway it'll go beyond sucked into like

329
00:34:26.40 --> 00:34:31.76
whether be dangerous I never felt like that no I was always like all this is this is just the

330
00:34:31.76 --> 00:34:36.24
training right okay then yeah then that makes sense that you could go to when they say oh yeah

331
00:34:36.24 --> 00:34:40.24
here's a eight hour sleeper whatever you could go to well this might be too good to be true yeah like

332
00:34:40.24 --> 00:34:43.84
oh yeah so I'm saying what you're saying is you're sure that there's guys that were like yeah that's right

333
00:34:43.84 --> 00:34:48.16
yeah man of course way too hard and then those are the guys that when they get when the trick

334
00:34:48.16 --> 00:34:53.36
comes they get trapped brother devastated yeah devastated mentally devastated that's why it's one of the

335
00:34:53.36 --> 00:34:57.12
best things well not a lot you know there's a lot of people that don't get out of that bed

336
00:34:57.12 --> 00:35:02.16
right they don't get out of that bed because as soon as you get out you're going straight to the

337
00:35:02.16 --> 00:35:08.000
surf zone and people don't like that man I mean you can hear seals talk about it guys can

338
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.44
get scarred from liking the ocean for years man for years they they don't want to go in the water

339
00:35:15.44 --> 00:35:21.28
they don't want to do it because because they just they use it as an implementive torture

340
00:35:21.28 --> 00:35:28.72
me I didn't care you know like I surfed and it was all good you know let's go get some sort of

341
00:35:28.72 --> 00:35:38.72
how back to the book so he's home he's taking a little time off he goes back and starts doing

342
00:35:39.44 --> 00:35:46.000
kind of local let's call it like local guard type activities and then we get this in August I

343
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.68
received a telegram telling me that my home in south London had been hit by a sea mine and I was

344
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:58.000
given compassionate leave to return what the hell was a sea mine doing inland it must be a mistake I

345
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.76
thought however apparently there was such a thing which came down attached to a parachute so that's what

346
00:36:03.76 --> 00:36:12.72
the Nazis were doing and so he gets little leave to go and check things out and so he goes and here we

347
00:36:12.72 --> 00:36:17.76
go this is him finding his home upon reaching Grove Park as I turned into fairfield road I immediately saw

348
00:36:17.76 --> 00:36:22.40
that our house had received a direct hit there is now just a heap of debris where once it stood

349
00:36:22.40 --> 00:36:28.80
half a dozen houses and dozens more were badly damaged the local ARP warden told me that not one

350
00:36:28.80 --> 00:36:33.36
person had been killed because everyone had taken to their Anderson air raid shelters my parents were

351
00:36:33.36 --> 00:36:38.000
both okay and staying with some friends of mile of the road it was a shock to see our home destroyed

352
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.16
but after all I had seen in France I think I must have become immune to any real emotions

353
00:36:46.56 --> 00:36:51.92
and then this happens in October as a result of a directive sent out by our prime minister

354
00:36:52.56 --> 00:36:58.08
Winston Churchill we received a letter which was read out to us by the regimental sergeant major

355
00:36:58.88 --> 00:37:06.08
volunteers he shouted for a new type of fighting soldier are required he glanced over the top of the

356
00:37:06.08 --> 00:37:14.16
paper BDI's registering some amusement soldiers he carried on to be trained as commandos and

357
00:37:14.16 --> 00:37:21.76
parachutists now I know that you would not wish to desert the regiment but anyone wishing to volunteer

358
00:37:22.40 --> 00:37:34.000
one-paced forward march glaring as he did so he took three stealthy steps towards us well

359
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:43.76
you all chicken then there was not a titer nor even a hesitant shuffle meaning everyone was just standing

360
00:37:43.76 --> 00:37:49.52
fast I fought back to the days in France I thought of a carnage of the British prisoners of war

361
00:37:49.52 --> 00:37:54.40
the warric regiment heard it into a field just outside Dunkirk and machine gun to death by the

362
00:37:54.40 --> 00:38:01.28
waffen SS I thought of my home being blown to smithereens and how the Germans were blocking my

363
00:38:01.28 --> 00:38:06.96
ambition to become a London policeman I took a pace forward before it was too late

364
00:38:11.20 --> 00:38:16.16
and some time passes as they try and get everything organized and then it continues on I was to

365
00:38:16.16 --> 00:38:22.48
join number two commando later renamed the 11th special air service battalion and still later

366
00:38:22.48 --> 00:38:28.56
the first parachute battalion in Britain at that time there was little no knowledge of the techniques

367
00:38:28.56 --> 00:38:32.72
of parachuting so everything had to be thought out very carefully there were no special types of

368
00:38:32.72 --> 00:38:37.52
parachutes for jumping from aircraft and no suitable aircraft the whole lot had to be devised

369
00:38:37.52 --> 00:38:46.56
developed and tested all too often with fatal casualties or severe injuries just learning how to

370
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:56.16
conduct parachute operations from scratch so they start their training and the training is

371
00:38:56.16 --> 00:39:04.72
is really really hard as you can imagine here we go now we settled down to some real soldiering

372
00:39:04.72 --> 00:39:09.92
and I actually begin to enjoy the tests thrust upon us I didn't realize it first that we were

373
00:39:09.92 --> 00:39:15.68
being used as human guinea pigs trying out new methods of roughing it and of delivering a soldier

374
00:39:15.68 --> 00:39:21.92
to the place of battle for everyone for everyone it was a taste test of strength involving

375
00:39:21.92 --> 00:39:30.64
guts sheer cunning and a determination to win some conditions were abominable but my conscious told

376
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:38.08
me that this was a challenge I must rise to and again this is when you got someone that's learning

377
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:53.60
through repetition how to take pain and suffering and do it in a way that is no factor

378
00:39:55.60 --> 00:40:01.52
jumping forward here through some training that they go through and all the training is just

379
00:40:02.72 --> 00:40:06.80
it's a it's a guinea pigs right the training is just guinea pigs they're just doing crazy things

380
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:11.52
to these guys and then they do their first parachute jump get done with that within the next week

381
00:40:11.52 --> 00:40:16.16
our seven jumps had been achieved and we could not wait to sew those blue wings on the right arm

382
00:40:16.16 --> 00:40:22.24
of the battle's battle dressed blouse one laddy even brought his sewing kit along with him and sat

383
00:40:22.24 --> 00:40:28.40
down to the corner of the hanger to get them on before anyone else it was odd to see a man walking

384
00:40:28.40 --> 00:40:35.12
around in with and shot and manchester with their wings winged shoulders slightly forward of the

385
00:40:35.12 --> 00:40:42.72
rest of their bodies civilians and other non parasolgers were asking who are these blocks with the wings

386
00:40:42.72 --> 00:40:50.000
some sort of secret unit that's not a little bit of unit pride right this is why

387
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.68
dichotomy of leadership when life and Seth disobeyed big jocco in what started wearing patches

388
00:40:59.68 --> 00:41:04.08
this is one of those things that you know I was thinking the back of my head like the if you're

389
00:41:04.08 --> 00:41:08.40
gonna if that makes you hold your chest out a little bit higher and you get that unit pride

390
00:41:09.12 --> 00:41:17.44
I'm gonna let it slide continuing on we were training both as parachutes and also for the

391
00:41:17.44 --> 00:41:23.60
specialized work of the commando which meant that a lot of extra work had to be put into achieve the

392
00:41:23.60 --> 00:41:33.92
very best end result above all above all it was emphasized it was emphatically stressed that we

393
00:41:33.92 --> 00:41:39.92
should never accept defeat even when up against overwhelming odds and we were taught to persevere

394
00:41:39.92 --> 00:41:51.36
to the end and to be able to endure great if not impossible fatigue sound familiar that's what we do

395
00:41:53.68 --> 00:42:04.24
that's what we do in the military taught to persevere to the end and I guess that's so much of that is

396
00:42:04.24 --> 00:42:10.88
so much of that is what the we know how you're taught to do that because you do it because when you go

397
00:42:10.88 --> 00:42:17.52
to like sealtraining or whatever there's no class that says okay when you get tired think about this

398
00:42:17.52 --> 00:42:23.44
no class that says that no class that says when you feel like you want to quit then you should think

399
00:42:23.44 --> 00:42:28.88
about this or you should say this no if you're if that's where your head is at and you want to

400
00:42:28.88 --> 00:42:34.80
quit there's no they don't teach you anything to stop it what what you learn the way you're taught

401
00:42:34.80 --> 00:42:39.36
is by oh I'm gonna get through this that's what's gonna happen I'm gonna get through this

402
00:42:43.44 --> 00:42:50.80
of course we have to learn a little bit about hand-to-hand combat we practice not only the use of

403
00:42:50.80 --> 00:42:58.000
the knife but also how to best avoid one when used against us Chinese experts taught us judo

404
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.48
and unarmed combat with a rifle and fixed bayonet we would be flung at you or sorry a rifle with

405
00:43:04.48 --> 00:43:08.96
fixed bayonet would be flung at you by the instructor who yell come on lunge it me I

406
00:43:10.08 --> 00:43:16.64
lunged hesitantly for the first time come on long shanks lunge you won't get anywhere near me

407
00:43:17.28 --> 00:43:22.64
right made I thought you asked for it and I took a really good lunge but this man was an old hand

408
00:43:22.64 --> 00:43:27.28
like lightning he paired my blow and before I knew it I was flat on my back minus the rifle

409
00:43:28.48 --> 00:43:33.68
it was the same with the fighting knife and quite a few of us nursed cuts at the end of a

410
00:43:33.68 --> 00:43:42.88
day's training those knives were razor sharp just called real world in April of 1941 we were visited

411
00:43:42.88 --> 00:43:51.68
by Winston Churchill accompanied by Sir Arthur Barrett and Major General Sir Hastings is May and he goes

412
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:57.36
he actually go I'm not going to tell the whole story but there's a one point where where reds has a

413
00:43:57.36 --> 00:44:05.68
little very short conversation with Winston Churchill and basically he's he's redges the receiver

414
00:44:05.68 --> 00:44:12.24
on a dison like a hand-to-hand combat display and he ends up getting from you know like a hip toss

415
00:44:12.24 --> 00:44:20.16
I'm imagining and and when he's done and he's gonna get him up off the ground and in Winston Churchill

416
00:44:20.16 --> 00:44:28.56
looks at him and says uh did you really try lad and and reds looks at him and says what do you

417
00:44:28.56 --> 00:44:36.08
bloody think sir and then he said Winston Churchill purses lips gave a big grin and waddled off looking

418
00:44:36.08 --> 00:44:44.80
delighted so that's pretty awesome interaction with Winston Churchill who by the way we haven't even

419
00:44:44.80 --> 00:44:51.44
we haven't even started to get into the Winston Churchill scene here on the podcast but you know it's

420
00:44:51.44 --> 00:45:00.000
covered you know it's covered and and that'll be I'm sure many podcasts and this is a little glimpse

421
00:45:01.44 --> 00:45:08.56
into the future continuing on bypassing usual military procedure various on orthodox methods

422
00:45:08.56 --> 00:45:13.76
and the use of small arms explosives were adopted and official eyes were shut so long as the end of

423
00:45:13.76 --> 00:45:20.24
the jaw and result was achieved one such stunt was with draw the safety pin from a hand grenade

424
00:45:20.24 --> 00:45:25.52
release the arm which we call the spoon release the arm which in turn would fire the four

425
00:45:25.52 --> 00:45:31.20
second fuse in the prime grenade making it really live hold it for a second and then throw it

426
00:45:31.20 --> 00:45:36.24
quickly the object being to make sure the enemy would have no time to throw it back and he won't

427
00:45:36.24 --> 00:45:42.72
refusing this dangerous venture would be subject to a variety of flowery names luckily we had no

428
00:45:42.72 --> 00:45:48.40
casualties to result and what makes that scariest so grenade as a four second fuse when you pull we

429
00:45:48.40 --> 00:45:54.000
are holding something that what do they call the arm it actually fits into the web of your hand this

430
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.64
this this piece of like light aluminum and you when you put it in the web of your hand and then

431
00:46:00.64 --> 00:46:06.48
you hold the grenade that thing is stuck in place now you then you next thing you do is you pull the pin

432
00:46:07.92 --> 00:46:11.44
because when the pin's in there that arm doesn't go anywhere because it's spring loaded as soon as

433
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:17.44
you pull the pin that there's tension on the spring that's ready to make that spoon or arm fly off and

434
00:46:17.44 --> 00:46:24.72
that's what arms it to blow up in four seconds the problem is is that the fuse is aren't perfect

435
00:46:25.84 --> 00:46:32.80
so depending on the fuse that you get could be could be three seconds could be six seconds

436
00:46:32.80 --> 00:46:38.32
could be four seconds like it's supposed to be is there a possibility it's two seconds yes there is

437
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:44.24
so when you cook we call it cooking it off so when you cook off that grenade there's a possibility

438
00:46:45.20 --> 00:46:52.96
that it goes off but if you don't cook it off at all and you throw it

439
00:46:53.60 --> 00:46:56.40
and you can throw it back you're especially if it's four seconds and one of their choices

440
00:46:56.40 --> 00:46:59.92
they can either jump on it they can dive away or they can grab it throw it back if they think you

441
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:05.04
haven't cooked it back well best thing do is get it out of there remember T Fred Harvey the

442
00:47:05.04 --> 00:47:17.60
he's getting grenade tossing fights with the Japanese so as this training is going on also

443
00:47:17.60 --> 00:47:22.88
we have to remember there's the mental fortitude part there's the tactical training but we can't

444
00:47:22.88 --> 00:47:28.32
ever forget just physically be in hard to keep on top form we had plenty of physical training cross

445
00:47:28.32 --> 00:47:36.64
country runs compass marches and night exercises discipline was self-imposed and any need to impose

446
00:47:36.64 --> 00:47:44.64
it by a superior was found upon yes that's what we want we don't want to we don't want to have to

447
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:49.04
impose discipline run about in leadership strategy tactics that's not the if you have to impose

448
00:47:49.04 --> 00:47:54.64
discipline some strong then you're a strong your leadership is wrong because if you're leading correctly

449
00:47:54.64 --> 00:48:00.24
the troops will put discipline on themselves they will they will acquire self-discipline because

450
00:48:00.24 --> 00:48:08.32
they understand why it's important psychological and physical resistance were driven to the

451
00:48:08.32 --> 00:48:15.04
utmost until men could take their limit and even more but it was never enough we were marched counter

452
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:21.12
marched and marched again in fair weather and in foul live ammunition fired at close range actually

453
00:48:21.12 --> 00:48:25.68
helped I found myself so preoccupied with making sure I did not get hit but I became oblivious

454
00:48:25.68 --> 00:48:30.56
to fatigue and plotted on at the end of the day's training I would stretch out on the hangar

455
00:48:30.56 --> 00:48:36.80
for absolutely shagged on passing sergeant Sid Oxley might prod me and say something like

456
00:48:37.36 --> 00:48:46.64
not bad lad not bad do better tomorrow eh get stuffed was the usual quiet reply as I slipped

457
00:48:46.64 --> 00:48:54.64
a well earned cigarette between my lips and drew hard so there's a pretty good chunk of this

458
00:48:54.64 --> 00:49:00.08
training in there and again all this training was they just created this they just created that

459
00:49:00.08 --> 00:49:08.80
this was new where like we're making up and props one thing when I look at the course of my entire life

460
00:49:08.80 --> 00:49:14.72
there's like a couple moments in time where things made an impression on me and one of the things

461
00:49:14.72 --> 00:49:20.56
that made an impression on me as a little kid was I had these toy soldiers I had a lot of toy

462
00:49:20.56 --> 00:49:30.000
soldiers but the British commandos from World War II they had little ladders they had little

463
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.88
grappling hooks they had boats and they had beanies right you know what I'm talking about I

464
00:49:38.88 --> 00:49:44.56
when you're a little you don't know what a beanie is I know a beanie is yeah okay we you know when you see a stereotypical

465
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:51.52
like let's say a robber in a movie and they're sneaking around and they're wearing a black beanie

466
00:49:52.08 --> 00:49:57.68
I think that all stems from the British commandos so for me when I saw like those little

467
00:49:57.68 --> 00:50:04.16
care it was a little soldiers that I had with black beanies and rubber rafts that look like Zodiacs

468
00:50:04.16 --> 00:50:11.76
they also had a little kayak for them too and I think all seeing those things I was always drawn

469
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:19.28
to the maritime component of special operations interesting hey I want to be the close what's the

470
00:50:19.28 --> 00:50:23.68
close thing I can be to a British commando I see these guys with boats and and the weird thing is I mean

471
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:30.56
that's that's not what these guys were doing and in fact and I didn't say this red red

472
00:50:30.56 --> 00:50:35.04
Curtis didn't know how to swim that's why he was so scared and he didn't he doesn't say it until

473
00:50:35.04 --> 00:50:39.44
he later in the book that's why he was so scared at Dunkirk that's why he's talking about how he's

474
00:50:39.44 --> 00:50:42.64
underwater there's nothing he can do about he's hanging around the rope because he does know how to swim

475
00:50:42.64 --> 00:50:48.88
and he's weighted down oh yeah but yeah the the British commandos which I'm sure will broke off

476
00:50:48.88 --> 00:50:57.04
from the parachute guys but that's kind of a major a major influence on a whatever six year old kid

477
00:50:57.04 --> 00:51:03.44
yeah I don't remember any well then again I guess I wasn't into the toy soldiers element

478
00:51:04.24 --> 00:51:09.12
yeah you were just getting like the regular big green toy soldiers from like the the grocery store

479
00:51:09.12 --> 00:51:15.28
right yeah yeah army men for sure I had NGJL I graduated from

480
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:24.16
playing green army men two legit little soldiers that came from different units and I had all these

481
00:51:24.16 --> 00:51:29.52
different units and I knew what kind of gear they had with them I had the Africa core right

482
00:51:29.52 --> 00:51:35.36
the Nazi Africa core and again the ones that stand out were the ones that had like looked a little bit

483
00:51:35.36 --> 00:51:39.52
different the Africa core guys were canned instead of green the British commandos were green

484
00:51:40.72 --> 00:51:47.52
I had I had pair troopers they were these they were little army men just they were smaller than the

485
00:51:47.52 --> 00:51:52.16
regular army men smaller yeah they were small they were I think I think there are no main

486
00:51:52.16 --> 00:51:57.52
cladiers of one thirty second I think they were really small they were you know a half an inch tall

487
00:51:57.52 --> 00:52:01.92
maybe and maybe a three quarters of an inch tall and they still had individual soldier that bottom

488
00:52:01.92 --> 00:52:08.24
platform that little bottom platform huh and I would set up battle scenes you know out in the yard

489
00:52:08.88 --> 00:52:15.44
and play by play the way things were unfolding yeah you probably went deep though I'm like you know

490
00:52:15.44 --> 00:52:21.52
on the regular army men set man set the guy who's crawling in the little crawl guy yeah yeah

491
00:52:21.52 --> 00:52:26.88
like he would be flying sometimes in my own scenario yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

492
00:52:26.88 --> 00:52:32.40
he could be in that flying position well I had that I had the model planes who I also had a

493
00:52:32.40 --> 00:52:39.92
teacher named Mr. McGurk in high school and he had a little army he had little planes all throughout

494
00:52:39.92 --> 00:52:45.60
his room the classroom hanging you know model little model planes model planes I had model planes too

495
00:52:45.60 --> 00:52:51.68
because it was all trying to make un-make this battle scenario and the weird thing is

496
00:52:52.72 --> 00:52:58.16
the weird thing is about this stuff is like okay if my son let's face it if my son has army

497
00:52:58.16 --> 00:53:02.48
soldiers we kind of expect that just to be normal right like hey of course I mean by the time

498
00:53:02.48 --> 00:53:07.68
that kid was born he had more soldiers than you know I'd do with yeah but there's some instinctual

499
00:53:07.68 --> 00:53:15.44
thing even you you are like back in Kauai right there's no I mean your mom wasn't

500
00:53:15.44 --> 00:53:19.68
saying hey I really want you to be interested in military stuff right and yet you had green

501
00:53:19.68 --> 00:53:24.000
army soldiers yes and even though some of them could fly which was a little bit unrealistic

502
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.40
some of them were still low crawling right some of them were engaging in battle against other

503
00:53:28.40 --> 00:53:36.88
soldiers well yeah so you have an instinct for war yes and I think most just like I talked earlier

504
00:53:36.88 --> 00:53:42.96
about the instinct for like hey I'm part of something bigger than me which is a beautiful thing

505
00:53:42.96 --> 00:53:47.60
if you think about it right that's a beautiful thing like I am part of this group that I'm

506
00:53:48.32 --> 00:53:54.64
I'm subordinate to this group as a powerful thing and it has to be countered correctly because

507
00:53:54.64 --> 00:54:02.16
you don't want to be someone that gets brainwashed and joins a cult right the the Bhagwan Shri Raj

508
00:54:02.16 --> 00:54:10.000
Nish cult sir right you don't want to be that person no no yeah that is weird now that you mentioned

509
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.20
that like yet it would call it an instinct for a instinct for war like I think because it's it's

510
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:22.000
so common like consider like G. I just okay I'll say this scenario so we we had a we're my dad

511
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.44
built their house and he well he was one of the people who built our house so when we're digging the

512
00:54:28.64 --> 00:54:34.000
cesspool it's like me skeptical septic tank septic tank I guess it's like a huge hole

513
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.40
okay super deep anyway they put the cap on it okay um this big concrete cap on it okay and then they

514
00:54:40.40 --> 00:54:46.16
fill it in and then but as it remains is still a big hole like the size of a jacuzzi okay about

515
00:54:46.16 --> 00:54:52.16
that size but it's just a dirt hole okay it's weird it's like a it literally like a dug in jacuzzi

516
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:58.32
in dirt so I'm not sure what this is but going yeah that's just the way it it's sorted itself out okay

517
00:54:58.32 --> 00:55:05.28
um so it sounds like a foxhole yeah you don't recall it that yeah but um for and then it

518
00:55:05.28 --> 00:55:11.52
it rained I'm quite rains pretty much every day yeah yeah no no no so it's storming but

519
00:55:11.52 --> 00:55:19.12
enough to put a cool little shallow puddle in the bottom of that and mud so we're in a muddy terrain

520
00:55:19.12 --> 00:55:25.52
scenario G. I. Joe yeah why is so we got hills we got the top of the hill we got the valleys

521
00:55:25.52 --> 00:55:30.96
the you know the water scenario at the bottom and oh yeah it was like battles going on the whole

522
00:55:30.96 --> 00:55:36.24
time we'd like stuff on fire and your dad was no military experience your mom was no military

523
00:55:36.24 --> 00:55:42.32
experience your neighbors my grandfather was at a D day but I did know that yeah yeah yeah yeah

524
00:55:42.32 --> 00:55:51.20
that's right salute but I had no idea at this point obviously but but unless we're still doing it

525
00:55:51.20 --> 00:55:55.76
G. I. Joe's good guys versus bad guys killing like you know you could take up on the part of the

526
00:55:55.76 --> 00:55:59.36
G. I. Joe's like you could blow them all with fire crackers and then bury them and like do all

527
00:55:59.36 --> 00:56:04.32
this stuff you should have a very serious stuff oh yeah you were going deep yeah big time

528
00:56:04.32 --> 00:56:11.04
catching the whole dramatic and it's not like someone like told me to tell that and how much

529
00:56:11.04 --> 00:56:17.84
how much did you see how many warm movies had you seen on TV even remember I don't remember but

530
00:56:17.84 --> 00:56:24.40
you know you could I mean this is what like 80s we'll say like 90s maybe there's some 18 going on

531
00:56:24.40 --> 00:56:30.40
18 and watch it not like religious anything so it's just we're talking to instinct that's the

532
00:56:30.40 --> 00:56:34.72
bottom yeah I did I mean mash was on I don't think I'd ever watch mash that's more than comedy though

533
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:41.52
that's not like a but yeah it's kind of a comedy if you if you watch that show it's actually

534
00:56:41.52 --> 00:56:46.96
in many ways there's some pretty heavy episodes of mash for oh actually because I remember watching

535
00:56:46.96 --> 00:56:52.80
it when I was a kid and there's definitely I remember watching that movie going oh watching that show

536
00:56:52.80 --> 00:56:57.28
sometimes and you ever in suspecting the laugh but then sometimes it would be super heavy because

537
00:56:57.28 --> 00:57:06.96
they would occasionally inject war yeah yeah right and yeah so yeah so I think there's just an

538
00:57:06.96 --> 00:57:14.08
instinct that people can have at some level and I think obviously just like instinct of

539
00:57:14.08 --> 00:57:18.64
being something bigger than yourself that's an instinct that people can have at different levels right

540
00:57:18.64 --> 00:57:24.48
not everyone's a 10 in hey I want to be part of a group that's bigger than me not everyone not everyone is

541
00:57:24.48 --> 00:57:28.000
in fact I I would say maybe you don't even want to be a 10 because then you're just looking for a

542
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.12
cult of joint right next thing you know you're buying a guy rolls Royces which is what you got to watch

543
00:57:35.12 --> 00:57:38.96
out for right so we're not looking to do that same thing with the war like instinct right there's

544
00:57:38.96 --> 00:57:42.64
some people that are pretty high up on that I believe I was pretty pretty high up on that because

545
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:48.80
I don't remember wanting to do other things right so like when I thought about my future as a child

546
00:57:48.80 --> 00:57:55.76
the thought was be a soldier like that's what I remember be a commando that's what I remember

547
00:57:56.32 --> 00:58:01.36
so it's you know it's something that and I'm sure there's a bunch of other you know like a

548
00:58:01.36 --> 00:58:07.36
a fatherly instinct right or a motherly instinct or uh here's another interesting one

549
00:58:07.36 --> 00:58:11.52
some people like to travel right so people want to move around a lot some people want to stay home

550
00:58:11.52 --> 00:58:16.64
there's like different levels of instincts that people have some people want to settle down and hold

551
00:58:16.64 --> 00:58:23.28
what you got some people don't want to do that at all so people have various instincts so

552
00:58:24.56 --> 00:58:31.28
I would say that what they did in this training is hone the instincts that people did have

553
00:58:31.28 --> 00:58:37.04
and get rid of people that didn't have enough of the instinct for war and you know once again

554
00:58:37.04 --> 00:58:41.60
talking about seal training they're not really teaching you anything they're just getting rid of

555
00:58:41.60 --> 00:58:47.20
people that don't have the right instinct yeah that's what they're really doing they're not teaching

556
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:55.60
anything you learn only because you learn from your experience but it's not an active teaching

557
00:58:56.24 --> 00:59:00.72
protocol yeah that's it so do you what do you think do you think that that's like

558
00:59:01.52 --> 00:59:05.52
good like is that and of course I'm gonna say is it the best way because we know it's the best way

559
00:59:05.52 --> 00:59:09.44
but is that kind of the best way to do it because it kind of seems like it could be the best way to

560
00:59:09.44 --> 00:59:14.16
do it like it's definitely it's definitely you're not gonna get neat well not you're gonna minimize

561
00:59:14.16 --> 00:59:20.32
the amount of stray voltage don't you kind of want to work with someone that has a higher instinct

562
00:59:20.32 --> 00:59:26.000
for winning yeah then someone that's got to be coaxed and trained yeah exactly what I'm saying

563
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.36
that's what it seems like that's why it seems like it's a pretty good thing to me yeah it's almost

564
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:33.76
like what you rather have on your football team someone that I think about this think about

565
00:59:33.76 --> 00:59:37.60
you're the who's the person that brings people onto the team it's not the coach but like the

566
00:59:37.60 --> 00:59:42.96
GM I don't know so let's say you're in control of a football team and you're gonna take this

567
00:59:42.96 --> 00:59:47.76
thing as far as you can this is your only job do you want the guy that you get that you have to

568
00:59:47.76 --> 00:59:54.000
train a bunch to get him to be able to run a fast for fast 40 or do you want a guy that comes

569
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.40
out of the gate and he's kind of already there right this is the no-brainer of course now there are

570
01:00:00.40 --> 01:00:07.04
outliers that I actually want this guy that was slow but he's such a hard worker and a grinder

571
01:00:07.04 --> 01:00:11.60
that he's gonna excel anyways like I want that guy and guess what see what training does that you

572
01:00:11.60 --> 01:00:15.84
know if you're a gazelle and you're really great athlete it doesn't test you as much as the guy

573
01:00:15.84 --> 01:00:20.56
that's a grinder yeah but the guy that's a really great athlete has a little bit more value

574
01:00:20.56 --> 01:00:24.16
out of the gate than the guy that's a grinder once you show up at the team though you want the

575
01:00:24.16 --> 01:00:29.04
guy that's a grinder more than you want the guy that's a good athlete right yeah so almost like

576
01:00:29.04 --> 01:00:33.12
it's all sort of and that's not a guarantee every time because there's some guys that were

577
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:38.24
freaking great athletes and they were just incredible so don't don't take that one wrong but

578
01:00:39.04 --> 01:00:45.92
necessarily a guy that's a great athlete versus a guy that is just has can gut through it

579
01:00:46.40 --> 01:00:52.56
probably I would lean towards the guy that can gut through it because he has a level of grit

580
01:00:53.12 --> 01:00:57.44
you're not you don't face a pull-up bar out in the battlefield right you're not you don't you know

581
01:00:57.44 --> 01:01:02.80
it's not there yeah and then and that makes sense I mean it's all kind of in the same bucket

582
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:07.52
really but where like these are just attributes right so how does life put it he'll say um

583
01:01:08.80 --> 01:01:14.40
buds is just a screening process to weed out people who we don't think have the characteristics

584
01:01:14.40 --> 01:01:19.68
to be successful on the battlefield which is a very eloquent way of putting it eloquent so those

585
01:01:19.68 --> 01:01:25.12
characteristics aren't necessarily who can do the most pull-ups it's not that because look if you're

586
01:01:25.12 --> 01:01:29.20
doing like there's a minimum though right obviously like you have to do a certain amount of

587
01:01:29.20 --> 01:01:34.32
minimum is so minimum to like get to buds the minimum is so minimum it should be disqualifying

588
01:01:34.32 --> 01:01:38.48
if you can actually only do that many right not kidding the minimum pull-ups go to buds is something

589
01:01:38.48 --> 01:01:44.40
like 10 right tiny it's ridiculous yeah so just like how you said it's like okay we haven't

590
01:01:45.12 --> 01:01:51.20
we have a minimum and that's sort of it so who cares if you can do 50 who cares really

591
01:01:51.20 --> 01:01:57.20
we care about other stuff yeah well there's a well-rounded component right and and that's what

592
01:01:57.20 --> 01:02:02.16
makes that's the thing that makes the seal training hard is you can't just be a fast runner

593
01:02:02.72 --> 01:02:10.16
you can't just be a fast swimmer you can't just be strong upper body you can't just be comfortable

594
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:18.72
in the water you can't just be durable you gotta be all those things and what's hard is they're

595
01:02:18.72 --> 01:02:26.56
contrary to each other right because being able to run 14 miles is one type of person that's

596
01:02:26.56 --> 01:02:32.16
going to be really good at that being able to get through the obstacle course is another person

597
01:02:32.16 --> 01:02:35.68
that has a lot of upper body strength this person has a lot of endurance this person have

598
01:02:35.68 --> 01:02:40.48
and then you add in hey you need to be able to pick up your body and sprint with them over the

599
01:02:40.48 --> 01:02:47.12
burn that's explosiveness so we want this really kind of middle of the road on a bunch of different

600
01:02:47.12 --> 01:02:53.60
things well-rounded as opposed to someone that's just really good at one particular thing and

601
01:02:53.60 --> 01:02:58.72
there's all kinds of people that show up that are great athletes in one category and it does a

602
01:02:58.72 --> 01:03:05.12
work for yes so that the attribute of all the attributes that attribute about the guy who can

603
01:03:05.12 --> 01:03:10.88
gut through stuff sort of lifts up all those attributes if didn't it not that high so let's say

604
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:18.48
that's the main one then yes yes you want the guy who that comes naturally to rather than the guy who

605
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:26.56
it might they're teaching may falter later I want that to be part of you makes sense part of you

606
01:03:26.56 --> 01:03:31.84
and man what a good quality to have that's the thing that's that's the thing people look we

607
01:03:31.84 --> 01:03:38.16
ever want to get to certain amount of talent you can decide to work hard you can decide to work

608
01:03:38.16 --> 01:03:44.56
hard now now there are people that say that work ethic is a talent right I get that concept

609
01:03:45.28 --> 01:03:50.64
and I think the reason it appears to be that way is because you get people that work so hard

610
01:03:50.64 --> 01:03:56.000
that you think oh that must be a talent of theirs right to have this talent that you're going to work

611
01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.28
so hard I don't I well I think that you have well you do you have way more influence over that

612
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:09.92
talent than you do over your explosive strengths yeah I mean infinitely more yeah because you can't I don't

613
01:04:09.92 --> 01:04:16.88
know the of the seminal genetics expert but I don't know that there's a gene or a series of genes

614
01:04:16.88 --> 01:04:24.40
that gives you work ethic yeah I would say the answers no right I mean not not all right I mean we

615
01:04:24.40 --> 01:04:31.68
could check with the bro science like schools on that one yeah those but they're I bet you know when

616
01:04:31.68 --> 01:04:35.20
they start breaking down this genetic stuff they're going to start finding stuff about people that's

617
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:38.96
going to be really interesting and some of it will be tight I mean I'm not going to say I'm Harris

618
01:04:39.52 --> 01:04:46.32
you know you're every decision that you make is kind of pre-plan free will but you know I'm

619
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:51.36
sure Sam and I will have a chance to sit down if he has the courage to step up to the plates

620
01:04:51.36 --> 01:05:00.24
and have a real conversation with me but but I bet as this stuff gets uncovered they will find

621
01:05:00.24 --> 01:05:07.92
that there's a propensity like a propensity for focus yeah because that's what hard work is kind of

622
01:05:08.32 --> 01:05:15.52
is just hey look like when I was going to college and I would get to I would do one semester I took

623
01:05:15.52 --> 01:05:23.68
five English classes the dumbest thing I've ever done I would be so crushed with reading over you

624
01:05:23.68 --> 01:05:27.92
know during the week but then on the weekend would come and I'd have to read five English

625
01:05:27.92 --> 01:05:33.36
classes worth of reading and that was when I would be like okay I would have to like turn the

626
01:05:33.36 --> 01:05:41.04
switch in my head and just go fall on sit there and read for 10 hours and read and remember what I

627
01:05:41.04 --> 01:05:48.48
was reading so that was a switch it was like oh and I remember thinking myself I'd be talking to

628
01:05:48.48 --> 01:05:53.76
other people that had one English class and they'd say I'd say they said did you do the reading

629
01:05:53.76 --> 01:05:56.40
can you tell me what happened and I'd be like yeah of course I did the reading and they'd be like

630
01:05:56.40 --> 01:06:00.80
I cannot sit down and read for that long and I'd be like no hey you don't care

631
01:06:01.44 --> 01:06:07.84
be you like discipline see maybe I've got a little propensity to be able to turn it on or

632
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:12.96
maybe it just through force of will look I want to get an A in this class why because

633
01:06:14.32 --> 01:06:17.76
because I don't want these instructors looking at me thinking that they got a little

634
01:06:17.76 --> 01:06:23.44
sunk mommy no you don't got anything on me I'll read this material and I'll know it

635
01:06:23.44 --> 01:06:29.92
yeah and all that it all that right there is it's so you do just so everyone realizes I'm not crazy

636
01:06:29.92 --> 01:06:34.56
that's just gamification that's just gamification in my head to make things fun to make things

637
01:06:34.56 --> 01:06:38.40
challenging right I'll do that with anything all day long you if I've got something to do I'm

638
01:06:38.40 --> 01:06:44.64
gonna have a good time with it yeah we're gonna have a good time with it I'm fine so when you hear me

639
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:51.68
you know I was watching someone Larry Bird and he was this he's famous for talking trash

640
01:06:51.68 --> 01:06:58.16
to all the other players and but he works so hard he was also famous for his work ethic

641
01:06:59.36 --> 01:07:03.36
but I think there's a little bit of gamification right when you go I'm gonna do this to you I'm

642
01:07:03.36 --> 01:07:08.08
gonna do like he would come down the court be any you he'd say like he'd say uh the here comes

643
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:12.32
three who wants it meaning come and try and guard me I'm gonna hit a three pointer and he would do it

644
01:07:12.32 --> 01:07:17.60
yeah you know there's a little bit of gamification people respond well that so that's me

645
01:07:17.60 --> 01:07:21.60
when I was going to college as a 28 year old man by the way I'm not talking I was an 18 year old

646
01:07:21.60 --> 01:07:27.12
kid all worried about how I looked and what the party well I'm worried about any of that yeah

647
01:07:27.12 --> 01:07:32.80
I was in there to win and in order to win I made it into a game for myself yeah oh you think you're

648
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:36.56
gonna ask me you think that you're gonna come up with a question on this reading material that you

649
01:07:36.56 --> 01:07:41.20
gave me that I'm not gonna go to the answer to watch this so that way I'm actually banded tension

650
01:07:41.20 --> 01:07:47.20
actually paying attention what's going on as opposed to I don't care doesn't really matter

651
01:07:47.20 --> 01:07:50.88
I'm in the navy anyways who cares what I get for a grade ball ball ball ball ball I could make

652
01:07:50.88 --> 01:07:54.88
those excuses all day you can always take the easy path if you want to it's always there

653
01:07:55.44 --> 01:08:00.32
but you just gotta remember that it leads downhill and if you take the righteous path well

654
01:08:00.32 --> 01:08:08.16
then you're gonna move in the right direction yeah but it still seems like you got all those

655
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:14.40
methods we'll say like from you know like you weren't born with that you know kind of thing

656
01:08:14.40 --> 01:08:20.80
you know it seems like you know you got yes it does see it seems like it's a choice that I make

657
01:08:20.80 --> 01:08:26.96
well and it seems also like where you like what you learned along the way what right how that's

658
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:32.32
what what lessons got reinforced you know what lessons got reinforced for me if I don't work hard I'll

659
01:08:32.32 --> 01:08:37.28
lose yeah that lesson got reinforced I'm the over and over and over again if I don't work hard I'll

660
01:08:37.28 --> 01:08:47.76
lose if I work hard I can do better I might not win but I can do better and I'll tell you something else

661
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:53.12
if your attitude is like if your attitude is only I'm gonna win like that's why I'm doing this

662
01:08:53.12 --> 01:08:58.88
you're not gonna win every time but let me tell you what your attitude can be I might not win

663
01:08:58.88 --> 01:09:06.80
every time but I'm gonna get your respect yeah you when you get done beating me when you get done

664
01:09:06.80 --> 01:09:12.64
beating me and you shake my hand you're gonna mean it because you you had you you're gonna mean it

665
01:09:12.64 --> 01:09:17.04
I'm gonna push you at a minimum that's what's happening so if you beat me and by the way I don't

666
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:21.92
hold it against you when you beat me I respect if you beat me I know you worked I know you got I know

667
01:09:21.92 --> 01:09:28.32
you got after which is cool and I don't I don't held any angst whatsoever it's good actually

668
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:33.92
because I know that this guy worked hard with me and I know I got to work even harder so good for you

669
01:09:33.92 --> 01:09:41.20
so that's that comes that's learned that's me learning as a kid oh I wasn't good at this

670
01:09:41.20 --> 01:09:46.72
and even I looked back in my life now like I wasn't great at soccer I never played soccer outside

671
01:09:46.72 --> 01:09:51.44
the soccer season other kids are running around dribble in the soccer ball whatever going to camp

672
01:09:52.48 --> 01:09:59.28
whatever I didn't didn't care enough didn't we didn't understand the first thing that I got well

673
01:09:59.28 --> 01:10:04.000
I got very focused in the sealed teams and in the sealed teams because you're going to get

674
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.84
high caliber people not all of them but you got some people to top of the bell curve that are

675
01:10:07.84 --> 01:10:12.72
freaking bad asses and if you're if for me so I got these incredible athletes you know when I

676
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:17.04
checked in a sealed team one I'm gonna try and think this was probably 10 of us went to

677
01:10:17.04 --> 01:10:21.84
sealed team one a pretty good chunk of you guys went to sealed team one there was some guys in

678
01:10:21.84 --> 01:10:30.56
that went to sealed team one that were total athletic studs I mean infinitely better than me

679
01:10:30.56 --> 01:10:36.24
and every category of athleticism you know and I knew like okay if I'm gonna hang with these guys

680
01:10:36.24 --> 01:10:41.68
I'm gonna have to work really really hard just to hang with just to hang with not to beat them

681
01:10:42.40 --> 01:10:49.52
just to hang with them so that idea gets reinforced over time okay if I don't work hard I'll be at the

682
01:10:49.52 --> 01:10:54.80
bottom of the barrel and and then what it boils down to if I'm at the bottom of the barrel how much

683
01:10:54.80 --> 01:11:02.08
am I helping with team because if I'm a if I'm a detriment to the team now now what am I

684
01:11:02.08 --> 01:11:06.88
even doing with my life right I do not want to be a detriment to the team I want to be a

685
01:11:06.88 --> 01:11:10.88
positive to the team and even though I might not be the best guy in the pollton I might not be the

686
01:11:10.88 --> 01:11:16.88
strongest the fastest the best shot whatever those things are if I'm third or fourth or fifth in

687
01:11:16.88 --> 01:11:23.12
some of those categories okay well now I'm a benefit to the team now I can help which is what

688
01:11:23.12 --> 01:11:29.12
it all boils down to and what it all boils down to is like you know you can make an excuse for yourself

689
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:38.72
and live with it a little bit but you can't make an excuse for the team meaning hey look even in

690
01:11:38.72 --> 01:11:42.64
extreme case well you know if I'm not that great of a shot and the enemy gets a shot off

691
01:11:42.64 --> 01:11:48.16
quicker than me oh well I'm gonna die that's the that's the job of got that's the choice of you

692
01:11:48.16 --> 01:11:53.04
know whatever but if you just play that out one step further if I don't get this shot off

693
01:11:53.04 --> 01:11:57.68
this guy will have the chance to shoot one of my buddies that's you need to put more rounds down

694
01:11:57.68 --> 01:12:02.56
range you need to shoot more you need to get better and faster fast run your reloads fast run your

695
01:12:02.56 --> 01:12:05.52
draw faster in your side picture that's what you need to get better because you don't let your

696
01:12:05.52 --> 01:12:10.56
teammates down yeah so when that's what's really driving you that's powerful that's more powerful

697
01:12:10.56 --> 01:12:15.92
than I just want to be the best I don't want to just be the best because you can give yourself a little

698
01:12:15.92 --> 01:12:21.04
slack in there but when you look at it you say oh I don't want to let my teammates down they're

699
01:12:21.04 --> 01:12:28.72
counting on me that will make you stay up later that will make you wake up earlier that will drive

700
01:12:28.72 --> 01:12:35.44
you to try and be better and that lesson that lesson on me got reinforced over and over again

701
01:12:35.44 --> 01:12:41.36
and if I didn't work hard then I wouldn't be I failed something in Buds called pool competency

702
01:12:43.04 --> 01:12:50.000
and I should I to fail it right and I was gonna say I shouldn't have failed it and the reason

703
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.96
I was gonna say I shouldn't have failed it was because I was comfortable in the water I

704
01:12:52.96 --> 01:12:58.56
done all the water stuff kind of first time every time meaning not tying in life saving I was good

705
01:12:58.56 --> 01:13:05.36
I felt really comfortable and so when I failed it I was sort of I was deeply disappointed

706
01:13:05.36 --> 01:13:10.64
that I failed it and I was hyper worried that maybe I'm not gonna make it through this training

707
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.96
and so we mean a couple of the other guys that failed we spent the entire weekend

708
01:13:17.68 --> 01:13:23.60
in the dip tank which is the little box that you fill with water to clean stuff in

709
01:13:24.24 --> 01:13:29.76
and I don't even know why the instructor's lettuce he was dive gear I have no idea why this was not safe

710
01:13:30.56 --> 01:13:34.96
and maybe we just did it I don't really remember but we got in this dip tank and we

711
01:13:34.96 --> 01:13:40.64
did pool comp to each other for hours and we just ripped the stuff off and ripped you know

712
01:13:40.64 --> 01:13:45.28
crossed each other until we went through the procedure so many times when I went to retake pool

713
01:13:45.28 --> 01:13:52.000
comp it was it was easy it was easy when I went to retake it on Monday so what what lesson got reinforced

714
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:57.36
I need to prepare more I need to work harder I need to go to the extra distance or else I can fail

715
01:13:57.92 --> 01:14:02.32
so there's another little reinforcement I told you this one before I failed the run in seal training

716
01:14:02.32 --> 01:14:08.08
why did I fail run I failed the run in seal training because I paced myself and said well you

717
01:14:08.08 --> 01:14:13.92
know I'll save a little something and I didn't have anything to save what I needed to do was run as hard as I could

718
01:14:14.96 --> 01:14:20.32
so I failed the run when I paced myself the next run what did I do when that when they said go

719
01:14:20.32 --> 01:14:24.88
I ran as fast as I could for the entire thing because you're not allowed to wear a watch so you have no idea

720
01:14:24.88 --> 01:14:30.40
what the time is you just and so you think about that you think about when you're cruising on a run versus

721
01:14:30.40 --> 01:14:34.72
when you're running as hard as you can it's hard to tell where that cruise level's at because

722
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:40.000
am I running am I running a six minute mile if I'm cruising am I running a six thirdier

723
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.20
or am I running a seven twenty it can be hard to judge especially when you're sore like your

724
01:14:45.20 --> 01:14:52.08
your body sore so you know if you did if you did 500 eight count body builders at three o'clock in the

725
01:14:52.08 --> 01:14:57.60
morning and then you go out and you run your run your pace you might seem like you're running faster

726
01:14:57.60 --> 01:15:03.92
than you really are so when I learned from that I failed the run and now what I have to do I've

727
01:15:03.92 --> 01:15:08.64
realized I can never let off again can ever so there's a little lesson getting reinforced

728
01:15:09.44 --> 01:15:13.76
over and over and over again don't leave it up to chance don't leave it up to chance do let

729
01:15:13.76 --> 01:15:20.96
do the work and that's the way that's how you develop these things no one told me no one told me

730
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:24.88
what I just said I would maybe I wish somebody's would have and the reason I say maybe is because

731
01:15:24.88 --> 01:15:28.32
maybe you still don't learn it because there's some things that you have to actually go through

732
01:15:29.28 --> 01:15:32.80
there's some things that the only thing that's going to teach you is experience yeah and

733
01:15:33.68 --> 01:15:40.16
even like these you went through these things where the environment sort of provided these lessons

734
01:15:40.16 --> 01:15:46.000
no matter how like over or covert they were like provided to you through the environment like

735
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.40
you know like a like a farmer or something like this someone who's sort of grew up just working

736
01:15:50.40 --> 01:15:54.88
hard as a way of life you put them in another environment we're working hard will show itself

737
01:15:54.88 --> 01:15:58.96
or whatever or they'll work hard yeah because the environment sort of provided that whatever

738
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:04.88
so yeah so that makes sense you know and obviously we can't count every second of your life

739
01:16:04.88 --> 01:16:09.28
and years where this came from and it was it you know obviously but it seems like the work ethic

740
01:16:09.28 --> 01:16:14.32
and being able to like show fortitude like mentally through things or whatever it seems like

741
01:16:14.32 --> 01:16:19.52
that's an environmental thing fully it is and that's why redcurrence was biking five miles to work

742
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:24.88
in five miles home every day monday through Saturday yeah six days a week get some up in

743
01:16:24.88 --> 01:16:32.96
will please upill both ways so that is what they learned in this training some of these things

744
01:16:32.96 --> 01:16:39.12
that we just talked about and and again the book details these things really well but we're going

745
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:45.44
to jump ahead right now to a chapter five accrues to North Africa on the ship I bordered

746
01:16:45.44 --> 01:16:50.08
and after endless trudging along narrow passageways and up and down the steep stairs and

747
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:55.92
gangways I was directed to an area below the waterline after the ship soon after casting off

748
01:16:55.92 --> 01:17:00.64
we learned that we were heading for Algiers from where we would take part in a combined

749
01:17:00.64 --> 01:17:05.28
operation by Great Britain in the United States codenamed operation torch that's legit you get on

750
01:17:05.28 --> 01:17:09.68
this ship to leave you don't even know where you're going you're just going to go get some

751
01:17:09.68 --> 01:17:12.48
you yeah that's what you know you're going to go get some

752
01:17:12.48 --> 01:17:21.20
moving forward here they're on the ground um and again I hate to skip these parts this is a book

753
01:17:21.20 --> 01:17:27.28
you got to get and I'll talk about how to get it again because it's not a normal book we were

754
01:17:27.28 --> 01:17:34.56
informed that our objective was an enemy emergency air strip close to a place called Suk El Arba

755
01:17:34.56 --> 01:17:42.24
in Tunisia along the way we were attacked by two M.E.109s but these were success we shot down by our

756
01:17:42.24 --> 01:17:48.40
escorts of Spitfires boom thanks to the Americans easing their rule about smoking on aircraft

757
01:17:48.40 --> 01:17:52.96
I managed to feel more relaxed by puffing through half a dozen cigarettes so now they're going

758
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:57.60
for their jump by the way they're going to jump into this um into this emergency air strip

759
01:17:59.52 --> 01:18:04.000
it was a three hour journey in very hot and humid heat and we sat in the plane sweating like

760
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.12
pigs singing songs and cracking jokes to try and hide our feelings chunky said well lofty

761
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:11.92
that's his nickname he brings up a couple times well lofty won't be long now

762
01:18:13.52 --> 01:18:20.40
see you in heaven you must be joking mate I replied turtley he's got to be a damn good

763
01:18:20.40 --> 01:18:26.88
Jerry to catch up with me then the order was bellowed out action stations it made me shiver

764
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:35.04
hook up I was sweating sweating like hell and fell a bit weak at the knees I wondered out loud

765
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:41.04
what sort of reception are we going to get what mate crabsriast oh nothing I'm uttered

766
01:18:41.92 --> 01:18:47.28
I hooked up my line with shaky fingers managing to endure 10 minutes of standing

767
01:18:47.28 --> 01:18:52.32
while the plane came to in to drop us at the airfield out in the wild 70 miles

768
01:18:52.32 --> 01:18:58.80
from Tunis so the reason I put that part of there is just letting everybody know especially

769
01:18:58.80 --> 01:19:02.72
you young troopers out there that are going on hold the line you're going to be scared

770
01:19:03.68 --> 01:19:09.44
and even this guy that is just a fundamental badass across the board is shaking fingers

771
01:19:09.44 --> 01:19:17.36
he's sweating profusely he's scared and by the way he's hiding it to the best of his ability

772
01:19:17.36 --> 01:19:23.84
he's keep he's stifling that emotion continue on the jump master's piercing voice cut through

773
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:28.24
the sound of the aircraft stand to the door I swallowed hard and prepared for the exit

774
01:19:28.88 --> 01:19:33.84
when the order to go rang in my ears I became a changed man it suddenly felt so much cooler

775
01:19:33.84 --> 01:19:38.88
being whisked about in the air all around me were hundreds of parachutes we were finally dropping

776
01:19:38.88 --> 01:19:48.32
in action there you go so you're going to be scared once you get in the action you'll settle down

777
01:19:49.84 --> 01:19:56.72
and okay so now this is the land they move and now they get into a situation

778
01:19:58.16 --> 01:20:03.92
we were machine gun costly one minute we were in put in buses and the next taking cover

779
01:20:03.92 --> 01:20:10.80
once with Pat Dolan and chunky I dash for safety across an open ground and slid into a hundred feet

780
01:20:10.80 --> 01:20:15.28
slid into a hollow 100 feet from a derode as three small specks of mishrishmets

781
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:20.08
came diving straight for us from 4,000 feet I lay on my stomach looking at the aircraft through

782
01:20:20.08 --> 01:20:25.92
my camouflage net scarf as they came in fast much closer now and three of them open fire one

783
01:20:25.92 --> 01:20:30.96
concentrating on the road transport the other two honor men scrambling for cover on each side of the road

784
01:20:30.96 --> 01:20:36.96
bullet slash the ground ten feet from us kicking up fountains of dust bloody hell pat that was

785
01:20:36.96 --> 01:20:42.16
close said chunky they circled and came in for another run this time really low only about

786
01:20:42.16 --> 01:20:50.32
50 feet from the ground a couple of our act-act guns let fly jerry let rip and muck seem to be

787
01:20:50.32 --> 01:20:56.56
flying everywhere mainly rock splinters and dust as one aircraft clattered by I saw quite

788
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:02.96
plainly the pilot with a white scarf around his neck you fucking fool you might have killed us

789
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:08.72
someone shouted and then let out a bellowing laugh amazingly after all that strafing no one was

790
01:21:08.72 --> 01:21:13.84
seriously hurt and only two of our vehicles were rendered unserviceable as time went on things

791
01:21:13.84 --> 01:21:23.04
continued to hot up and the buses were soon abandoned in favor of foot slogging so again this is like

792
01:21:23.04 --> 01:21:28.24
a horrifying thing to think about these measures met one-on-nines coming down and strafing you

793
01:21:28.24 --> 01:21:37.28
with machine gun this pushing forward a little bit in the book there another situation

794
01:21:38.32 --> 01:21:43.28
then they turn towards us three stucodive bombers approaching us at about five thousand feet the

795
01:21:43.28 --> 01:21:48.000
sky was clear invisibility was good it was most weird not knowing whether they were interested in

796
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.64
us or just passing but they were interested in us all right the leading pilot made half a roll

797
01:21:54.64 --> 01:22:02.000
and nose down the preliminary commencing that awe-inspiring stucodive angle of 85 degrees as it

798
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.16
wind nearer I could see the evil go-win shape so clearly it seemed to be approaching me head on

799
01:22:08.16 --> 01:22:15.28
and it was and I was at my wits end as to whether I should get out and run for it or stay safely

800
01:22:15.28 --> 01:22:20.96
put but possibly perish before I could make up my mind us off for black dots moving away from the

801
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:28.64
aircraft they were bombs seemingly aimed directly at me they're discent accompanied by a high-pitch

802
01:22:28.64 --> 01:22:35.28
scream I gripped my smock and braised myself the sides of my slit trench took shook and a shower

803
01:22:35.28 --> 01:22:40.48
of freshly dug soil cascaded over my face partly filling the trench Christ that's closed I thought

804
01:22:40.48 --> 01:22:45.68
it allowed the other two stucos came into repeat the treatment and there seemed to be a never-ending

805
01:22:45.68 --> 01:22:51.52
succession of bombs violently vibrating around then the drone aircraft drifted away and as

806
01:22:51.52 --> 01:22:56.40
as black smoke below slowly skyward voices began to ring out as men sought to

807
01:22:57.20 --> 01:23:02.08
sought reassurance that others were okay chunky was there on the edge of my trench asking

808
01:23:02.08 --> 01:23:10.32
if I was all right putting on a brave front I said I was and I was except for a little excretion

809
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.16
but then getting away with nothing more than a wet pants after that lot did not hurt my pride

810
01:23:19.44 --> 01:23:25.76
I didn't tell the others though so that freaking bombs drop right on top of them

811
01:23:25.76 --> 01:23:36.32
pistons pants no factor happy to be alive continue on we need only been in and this is

812
01:23:36.32 --> 01:23:40.56
again skipping we had only been in Tunisia for a few days in our bag of enemy killed or captured

813
01:23:40.56 --> 01:23:45.68
was fast increasing together with quite an assortment of armored cards motorbikes and weapons

814
01:23:48.32 --> 01:23:53.52
they get into some gun fights I found myself going on a volunteer burial party for men

815
01:23:53.52 --> 01:24:01.12
known to be lost or killed in action for any dead or wounded paras that's a parachute guys

816
01:24:01.84 --> 01:24:06.32
the Arabs could be the biggest menace as some of them would think nothing of stripping

817
01:24:06.32 --> 01:24:11.28
a corpse of its clothing and then just leaving it if a ring would not come off the finger with

818
01:24:11.28 --> 01:24:17.44
ease the finger might be severed to achieve their greedy end at times it was reported that wounded

819
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:27.12
both sides were mutilated by these scum and here he's out on these um basically like on a

820
01:24:27.12 --> 01:24:34.32
little burial party after some of these battles had taken place we came upon two more paras

821
01:24:34.32 --> 01:24:39.28
one lying by a large rock a jagged cut with dried blood right across his temple

822
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.04
the other just a few yards away looking a bloated blue green

823
01:24:45.04 --> 01:24:51.28
I had seen dead soldiers before usually just after being killed but this retrieving of

824
01:24:51.28 --> 01:24:56.88
private papers of private papers and dog tags from dead men was not in my book of training

825
01:24:57.76 --> 01:25:01.52
and I was lost for a moment wondering if I was alone in this nightmare

826
01:25:02.96 --> 01:25:08.72
and then there's a there's a podray with a minister with him and he says the podray broke

827
01:25:08.72 --> 01:25:18.24
the silence by inquiring in a most serene voice now who have we here we buried those two side by

828
01:25:18.24 --> 01:25:27.12
side and then he goes forward here things were beginning to hot up now and we found ourselves

829
01:25:27.12 --> 01:25:32.88
taking part in some large scale skirmishes with an enemy who is not going to take it all lying down

830
01:25:32.88 --> 01:25:38.96
now he says hot up he doesn't say heat up and he says that throughout the books that's why

831
01:25:38.96 --> 01:25:44.80
I prayed for a little extra expression on it so people don't think that I was misreading it

832
01:25:44.80 --> 01:25:48.56
but he says things were beginning to hot up now maybe we'll bring that back

833
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:54.96
and here we go fast forward a little bit I was just taking a position with the mortar

834
01:25:55.52 --> 01:26:00.40
when the CEO went around firing his pistol on the open side slots of the tanks and calling

835
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:04.72
for the crews to come out so here's the CEO and there's some tanks some enemy tanks and this

836
01:26:04.72 --> 01:26:10.24
guy's approaching him with the pistol on reaching the third tank shots were fired back and he fell

837
01:26:10.24 --> 01:26:17.52
clutching his chest followed by his agitin captain Miles Whitelock who is hitting the face

838
01:26:17.52 --> 01:26:23.52
amid the general den of battle I was too busy to get trying to get dug into the rocky soil to

839
01:26:23.52 --> 01:26:28.72
make out exactly what had happened but soon learned that the CEO had been severely wounded and

840
01:26:28.72 --> 01:26:35.20
major Pearson was now to take over command it was a great blow to me at this time also to hear

841
01:26:35.20 --> 01:26:44.48
the death of my old friend Stanley Wandless I was horrified by a different site and a

842
01:26:44.48 --> 01:26:50.48
enormous brute of a pig munching away at a dead German soldier it seemed the pig had somehow

843
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:56.88
come across the wine in this farm got filthy drunk and was eating everything

844
01:26:56.88 --> 01:27:02.96
such scenes became horribly familiar but my stomach gradually grew accustomed to them

845
01:27:05.04 --> 01:27:09.92
on Christmas day 1942 I watched the rain fall as I tried to make myself a little more comfortable

846
01:27:09.92 --> 01:27:15.28
in my slit trench rain trickled down my neck my hands were wet and cold and if I had had a

847
01:27:15.28 --> 01:27:19.76
cigarette I would have enjoyed it my feet had been constantly wet for god knows how long and I was

848
01:27:19.76 --> 01:27:28.08
beginning to feel a teeny bit browned off when good news we were being withdrawn for arrest off we went

849
01:27:28.08 --> 01:27:36.24
to sucel comis where I thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of a mobile bathroom it de-lousing and refitting

850
01:27:37.36 --> 01:27:44.000
it was heaven but we soon returned to the grind once more so again I picked out some highlights of

851
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.48
the first kind of action that they had but you have to get the book to kind of follow along exactly

852
01:27:50.48 --> 01:27:55.44
what they'd been through but they'd been through really tough fighting and then finally they get the

853
01:27:56.64 --> 01:28:00.88
they get the turn they get the word that they're going to take a little break which they do but

854
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:07.52
you know like I said earlier it's it's a little break it's not big and just like I talked about

855
01:28:07.52 --> 01:28:13.12
the times where you get a little reprieve from the cold wet miserable but then you'd

856
01:28:13.12 --> 01:28:16.80
it's time to go back in and that's what you have to do and these guys do that.

857
01:28:19.20 --> 01:28:24.08
going on here between the two they're then up in this spot between the two towns is a hill called

858
01:28:25.20 --> 01:28:35.76
Jebel Montmansoir the commanding height to the pont du tunis road it's 2000 feet above sea level

859
01:28:35.76 --> 01:28:41.28
five miles around at the base and has an easiest climbing angle of 45 degrees also known by

860
01:28:41.28 --> 01:28:48.24
us as hill 648 it was occupied by crack German Africa core and alpine troops and it was our

861
01:28:48.24 --> 01:28:57.76
job to take it at all costs. I thought this word would be a tough nut to crack but the

862
01:28:57.76 --> 01:29:04.80
men were determined to win through this through but the men were determined to win through

863
01:29:04.80 --> 01:29:11.04
and shift the enemy once and for all we checked our arms and ammunition and collected 48 hours

864
01:29:11.04 --> 01:29:17.60
of rations. So there's this dominant high ground that they need to take and it's got their

865
01:29:17.60 --> 01:29:23.28
Africa core who I talked about earlier it's got the alpine troops these are these are really good

866
01:29:23.28 --> 01:29:27.92
German troops and this point early in the war you know this is when this is when the German

867
01:29:27.92 --> 01:29:36.48
military was really really good I mean later in the war they were still good but they you know

868
01:29:36.48 --> 01:29:41.04
they suffered massive casualties and they started having like little you know younger troops

869
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:44.48
inexperienced troop Hitler youth you know kids that were 14 years old out on the front lines

870
01:29:44.48 --> 01:29:50.16
getting after it this is early in the war these are experienced troops you know these are the troops

871
01:29:50.16 --> 01:29:58.40
that were this is where you know the the Prussian roots of military genius are showing through

872
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:08.000
and these troops and this is it this is these are tough tough this is a tough enemy so going on here

873
01:30:08.64 --> 01:30:13.36
we started off and it was quite a long way over rough and uneven ground before we halted at

874
01:30:13.36 --> 01:30:18.08
the base of an ugly massive looking hill the usual advanced bombardment that preceded most

875
01:30:18.08 --> 01:30:22.32
attacks was not forthcoming on this occasion as we wanted to maintain the element of surprise

876
01:30:22.96 --> 01:30:28.56
this time Jerry would be first to rock the boat as we waited at the base of the hill the sky now

877
01:30:29.60 --> 01:30:35.12
and again became bright with German nightlights which when fired heavenward made the whole area

878
01:30:35.12 --> 01:30:41.68
quite luminous everyone froze until they fell to earth and safety returned once more in the form of

879
01:30:41.68 --> 01:30:49.12
semi-darkness in this waiting game I found my thoughts strange back to England what I could do for a

880
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:55.52
couple of finds pints of English beer there's not until four o'clock in the next morning we ventured

881
01:30:55.52 --> 01:31:02.56
carefully toward forward through the undergrowth up went to more German nightlights then two more

882
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:07.36
then still more the places illuminated like daylight they must have got wind of us or smelt us

883
01:31:07.36 --> 01:31:12.48
we could determine the nationality of a soldier from at fifty feet if the wind was favorable

884
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:17.84
so probably they could do the same from the top of the hill two machine guns began firing

885
01:31:17.84 --> 01:31:22.88
then more joined in as the place were alive with them and they slashed and ripped mercilessly

886
01:31:22.88 --> 01:31:27.68
at the brack and slicing the branches of trees as if an invisible sharp knife had done the job

887
01:31:27.68 --> 01:31:32.56
I'll pull it went through my trouser leg gazing my thigh but I didn't think too much of it as I was

888
01:31:32.56 --> 01:31:38.88
still mobile German mortar started hitting the approach slope and yells a pain here and there told

889
01:31:38.88 --> 01:31:44.72
me to take more care the wine overhead was also warning that the enemy artillery was joining in

890
01:31:45.28 --> 01:31:50.64
as things hot it up with the occasional tracer bullet mixed in with the machine gun fire I could

891
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.12
almost feel the hot led piercing my limbs it was certain I would not get away with this time

892
01:31:55.12 --> 01:31:59.76
farther back things had gone wrong with our usual stalwart mules the amazing animals that

893
01:31:59.76 --> 01:32:04.56
carried our heavy gear where men could not set foot they didn't appreciate the sudden shelling

894
01:32:04.56 --> 01:32:11.60
and bolted out of control major clums be Thompson managed around some of them up with the

895
01:32:11.60 --> 01:32:20.16
help of a French officer major pre-alue and then all housing to be let loose our man our men yelling

896
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:27.76
woo hoo Muhammad as the R&T companies went in with their bayonets unfortunately asked company

897
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:33.12
miss their correct route the tapes laid to assist their assent had been damaged or cut by the enemy

898
01:32:33.12 --> 01:32:40.88
activity and at the count we were to find that they had suffered extremely heavy casualties and

899
01:32:40.88 --> 01:32:46.40
this can't of woo hoo Muhammad this is throughout the time that they're fighting in Africa and they do it

900
01:32:46.40 --> 01:32:50.72
when they get to Europe as well it's just the we something that the locals did and they started doing it

901
01:32:50.72 --> 01:32:59.44
too it's kind of like the term gung ho which gung ho the the Chinese turn which means work it's

902
01:32:59.44 --> 01:33:06.40
actually a Chinese communist term which means work together and you know we use it and they started

903
01:33:06.40 --> 01:33:12.24
using it I believe isn't a Korean war they started using that term but I had been in World War

904
01:33:12.24 --> 01:33:16.56
II working with the Chinese anyway I the I must have been when it was must have been

905
01:33:16.56 --> 01:33:21.52
we're doing World War II when they were working with the Chinese and the Chinese would say gung ho

906
01:33:21.52 --> 01:33:27.28
work together kind of means get fired up down well now yeah that's how we use it Americans

907
01:33:28.16 --> 01:33:36.32
we can take work together and turn it into get after it the barrage we were set up against was intense

908
01:33:37.04 --> 01:33:41.92
and a ricocheting bullet or shell splinter often did as much damage or more that is straightforward

909
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:47.52
burst of fire we could occasionally be lucky at one time an artillery shell failed to explode on

910
01:33:47.52 --> 01:33:53.04
impact with the ground and went on mercilessly ricocheting three times before coming to a rest with a doll

911
01:33:53.04 --> 01:34:01.60
plop but the bombardment was unrelenting and we had to work and we had our work cut out here

912
01:34:01.60 --> 01:34:06.96
there was agonizing shrieks of pain right and left to me as I passed unrecognizable

913
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:12.32
as I passed men unrecognizable soaked in blood being tended to a barrage splendid medics

914
01:34:12.32 --> 01:34:17.84
those unsung unarmed heroes Sam cost her and Frankie Thompson reached the summit and searched

915
01:34:17.84 --> 01:34:25.04
out and dealt with the enemy with no ceremony whatsoever as Sam told me afterward Frankie was

916
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:29.60
lunging and tossing men with his bayonet as though he as though they were sacks of straw

917
01:34:30.40 --> 01:34:35.60
Frankie was a big chap usually very friendly and quietly spoken but an action

918
01:34:35.60 --> 01:34:46.96
a different man picture that bayonet on your rifle and your throwing men off of it lunging

919
01:34:46.96 --> 01:34:52.08
and throwing men with the bayonet as if they were sacks of straw Frankie Thompson done play

920
01:34:54.40 --> 01:34:59.68
amid the turn all the turmoil and dead and wounded of both sides the curtain of fire had lifted

921
01:34:59.68 --> 01:35:08.32
and it was not a sound this is once they get up to the hilltop looking around the hilltop

922
01:35:08.32 --> 01:35:15.12
only a few of our men could be seen moving among the twisted forms our R T and S companies

923
01:35:15.12 --> 01:35:22.24
had suffered very heavy casualties more than half of the battalion officers had been killed or wounded

924
01:35:22.24 --> 01:35:32.88
he as they kind of get settled on the top of the hill he as they're preparing for a counter

925
01:35:32.88 --> 01:35:38.56
attack which they know the Germans are going to do he gets sort of tasked with going around and helping

926
01:35:38.56 --> 01:35:43.68
and gather up the sick dead or the wounded in the dead he goes on here setting about the job of

927
01:35:43.68 --> 01:35:50.64
collecting the wounded was something sickening as I gazed upon the scene of our once able and

928
01:35:50.64 --> 01:35:57.36
live comrades now quite still or with torn limbs I wondered whether there was any such thing as civilization

929
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:04.000
I bet hard on my lip and went about my task with grim determination

930
01:36:05.92 --> 01:36:11.84
looking around for someone to help I noticed a lad who is in the same troop as me early in

931
01:36:11.84 --> 01:36:20.80
1941 hello taffy and one of you been up to like a lift that's how he greets this guy cheers lofty

932
01:36:20.80 --> 01:36:26.56
and like I said lofty is the nickname of red cheers lofty is nice to see someone alive he said

933
01:36:26.56 --> 01:36:32.56
weirdly he was in a sitting position and apparently been hit by no fewer than five bullets

934
01:36:32.56 --> 01:36:38.56
they were all clean flesh wounds in the calf five four arm and one through the apex of his

935
01:36:38.56 --> 01:36:46.48
penis and all rather uncomfortable but no broken bones he was pretty well saturated with blood

936
01:36:47.04 --> 01:36:55.12
but cheerful let's try a fireman's carry I suggested he'd had a shot of morphine so I didn't think

937
01:36:55.12 --> 01:37:01.92
he'd feel he would feel too much anything to get away from here he said at that point Jerry started

938
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:06.96
up again with artillery and mortars then a few snipers and to make it really interesting

939
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:14.48
some sookah dive bombers stuccus dive bombers to join in the chorus let's get going before it gets

940
01:37:14.48 --> 01:37:22.08
too hot I've got to get you on my back I said so once again this is you know he's saying this

941
01:37:22.08 --> 01:37:27.76
so kind of matter of faculty he's up there trying to rescue this wounded guy who's obviously

942
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:34.80
badly wounded he's been shot five times and then they start with artillery and mortars

943
01:37:34.80 --> 01:37:40.000
and then snipers and then stuccadive bombers that's what's going on and then he says he says

944
01:37:40.64 --> 01:37:44.72
let's get going before it gets too hot it's like it doesn't get any hotter

945
01:37:46.80 --> 01:37:51.28
I've got to get you on my back I said I managed to get him over my shoulder without causing too much pain

946
01:37:51.28 --> 01:37:56.40
and we started along the long trek through wounded country ravines and open waste it was a

947
01:37:56.40 --> 01:38:02.08
ticklish and tender drop job but for two hours we struggled on I was sweating like two pigs and he

948
01:38:02.08 --> 01:38:08.08
goes through a description of how hard it was to get this guy to an area where he could get some

949
01:38:08.08 --> 01:38:14.56
of the help that he needed once he gets that guy dropped off continuing on I joined a section

950
01:38:14.56 --> 01:38:21.60
comprising men from T and S companies they were mostly newcomers I wondered what to become of all

951
01:38:21.60 --> 01:38:26.48
the friends I had not seen since the attack started one of the lads told me that major canron

952
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:33.84
had been killed and captain meller too I felt so alone no disrespect to the reinforcements

953
01:38:33.84 --> 01:38:37.36
but the cream of our men were fast disappearing in the foothills of Tunisia

954
01:38:38.88 --> 01:38:45.92
Jerry was counter attacking in earnest now and slinging everything at us in the way of explosives

955
01:38:45.92 --> 01:38:51.76
with batches of stuccadive bombers joining in at two hour intervals and making things even more

956
01:38:51.76 --> 01:38:57.60
deafening the muck was falling heavily and a splinter from a nearby bursting bomb

957
01:38:58.64 --> 01:39:02.32
slashed of vain in my right hand while another praying to my helmet

958
01:39:05.76 --> 01:39:11.04
nipping over rocks and creeping through bracken and bush under a hail of bullets and screaming

959
01:39:11.04 --> 01:39:16.56
shells I had become I became cut off from the party of men I'd been attached to I was making

960
01:39:16.56 --> 01:39:20.96
good progress and stopping for a breather dropped into a small depression in the ground.

961
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.36
Suddenly alone German pounced on me from the rear I realized what was happening instantly

962
01:39:27.36 --> 01:39:34.16
when I saw the field gray cut of his uniform my schmizer which was out of ammunition was

963
01:39:34.16 --> 01:39:40.56
slung band-lear fashion over my shoulder but I had an american 45 automatic cult ready in my right hand

964
01:39:40.56 --> 01:39:45.04
I went down on one knee summoned up the unarmed combat I had been taught

965
01:39:45.04 --> 01:39:50.24
grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and heaved him with all my force over my head it was my turn now

966
01:39:50.24 --> 01:39:56.72
and I was not so gentle as he rolled onto his back I sprang and landed my 14 stone weight

967
01:39:56.72 --> 01:40:01.76
feet first on his chest grabbing the cult which I had released to dangle on its landyard I

968
01:40:01.76 --> 01:40:08.56
started to squeeze the trigger shouting you butcher bastard to his no no comrade no no no

969
01:40:08.56 --> 01:40:17.36
I pulled the trigger but it was empty I grabbed his rifle check that it was loaded and ordered him

970
01:40:17.36 --> 01:40:24.40
to his feet donka donka he kept saying hugging his chest as we moved off and with that he

971
01:40:24.40 --> 01:40:31.68
starts moving to get this prisoner back under control arriving back at Borada after the

972
01:40:31.68 --> 01:40:36.80
formality of delivering my prisoner to custody I rejoin the rest of the battalion we were in

973
01:40:36.80 --> 01:40:41.84
great need of rest and a refit and we were and we're all sent by truck to a place called

974
01:40:43.12 --> 01:40:53.04
tabursuk some 60 miles away wall Borada was handed over with thanks to the Americans

975
01:40:54.72 --> 01:40:59.04
we were very soon back with the great so they get a little breather we were very soon back with a

976
01:40:59.04 --> 01:41:06.56
brigade this time in the Jebel aboid area the brigade's manpower was well down with the enemy

977
01:41:06.56 --> 01:41:13.44
and the enemy usually outnumbered us three to one death ridge as my pet one parah

978
01:41:13.44 --> 01:41:18.72
as my first parah position in happy valley was known also developed the name shell shock ridge

979
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:26.72
I tried closing my eyes at any given explosion it was a terrible feeling like waiting to be

980
01:41:26.72 --> 01:41:33.68
massacred the German started to mount an attack it was daylight and I could see motorized

981
01:41:33.68 --> 01:41:39.76
enemy units being dropped off at points as near as they dared to our positions three or four

982
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:46.72
miles off in the direction of sedegene they spread out and extended order and started tortoise

983
01:41:47.60 --> 01:41:52.40
we were told to hold our fire until the last minute so the whole first battalion lay very quiet

984
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:57.44
and still and we mortars saturated the area I felt the draft of an exploding shell which

985
01:41:57.44 --> 01:42:03.36
defamed my left ear and left it ringing and at the same time propelled me to the bottom of my trench

986
01:42:03.36 --> 01:42:10.000
making me even wetter than I already was now the mortar braided lift and I'm skipping ahead a

987
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.96
little bit now the mortar brazed lifted and I could hear the silence of the solider machine gun fire

988
01:42:16.96 --> 01:42:24.56
as it severed the undergrowth the enemy getting near all the time 60 yards 50 yards 40 yards

989
01:42:24.56 --> 01:42:30.88
I peaked gingerly over the edge of my hole in the ground 30 yards 20 yards then above the din

990
01:42:30.88 --> 01:42:38.32
the order was bellowed fire fire fire advance advance as we went out to meet them the

991
01:42:38.32 --> 01:42:43.68
battalion flung everything the enemy that it flung everything at the enemy that it could

992
01:42:43.68 --> 01:42:50.32
Tommy guns brand guns stand guns capped captured solathorns and smithers grenades English

993
01:42:50.32 --> 01:42:56.56
German Natayan coupled with the cry of woo hoo Muhammad gripping my rifle I advanced through

994
01:42:56.56 --> 01:43:02.32
the murderous fire the haze of smoke and the accurate smell of explosives every available man was

995
01:43:02.32 --> 01:43:07.60
on this one even the cooks before long the tables had turned in our favor with two dead

996
01:43:07.60 --> 01:43:12.24
paras lying to my left I hopped over a dead German and came upon a wounded one a little to my

997
01:43:12.24 --> 01:43:17.52
right he was contemplating using a luger pistol but I booted it from his hand and clomped him

998
01:43:17.52 --> 01:43:23.36
in the face with the butt of my rifle the whole episode was soon over with the enemy beating a

999
01:43:23.36 --> 01:43:29.44
hasty retreat and leaving a bag of captured clean shaven German parasheus flown in direct from

1000
01:43:29.44 --> 01:43:38.32
Germany to deal with us one a shock for them so that's like just again whatever a couple

1001
01:43:38.32 --> 01:43:46.88
paragraphs maybe two paragraphs and I mean it's total insanity right the guys are 20 yards away

1002
01:43:46.88 --> 01:43:59.76
before they get the the order not only to fire but to advance continuing on this is now they're

1003
01:43:59.76 --> 01:44:06.72
doing a coordinated attack while we pushed on with two paras and three paras brought up the rear

1004
01:44:06.72 --> 01:44:12.88
the British 139th brigade attacked on our right in time the pimple on this name of like a little

1005
01:44:12.88 --> 01:44:19.52
null was retaken and our brigade proceeded to press home the final assault amidst devastating artillery

1006
01:44:19.52 --> 01:44:28.80
and mortar fire from both sides tragically we found that we had gone a little too fast for our

1007
01:44:28.80 --> 01:44:36.08
25 pounders to increase their range quickly enough and we suffered heavy casualties from our own fire

1008
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:44.24
at daylight I passed a jock Pearson crouched by a rock bellowing into a field radio and none

1009
01:44:44.24 --> 01:44:50.08
too pleased with the person on the other end what do you think you're doing he wrote you're killing

1010
01:44:50.08 --> 01:45:06.48
all my bloody men so little horrible blue on blue scenario happening man everything but everything

1011
01:45:06.48 --> 01:45:11.84
seemed to be in our favor now even the weather was kinder and we must have advanced about eight

1012
01:45:11.84 --> 01:45:17.92
miles under a curtain of continuous fire both until both Italians and Germany were ready to

1013
01:45:17.92 --> 01:45:27.04
give in and we're running to be captured so think about this scene with just massive fire and you're

1014
01:45:27.04 --> 01:45:42.08
advancing under that fire for eight miles they get um they're they're doing this they're continuing

1015
01:45:42.08 --> 01:45:46.88
to advance in this part and here measure schmets buzz the area spraying the ground spasmotically

1016
01:45:46.88 --> 01:45:51.92
and causing those nearest to drop quickly into convenient holes we pushed on at a steady pace

1017
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:58.72
passed demolition guns past demolished guns and supplied dumps the air stinking with a pollen butchery

1018
01:45:59.52 --> 01:46:06.08
I glanced and stinctively towards a shell burst fifty yards away as I watched its jet black smoke

1019
01:46:06.08 --> 01:46:12.72
belt skyward my gaze was transfixed by something odd on the ground I wanted if it could be a human

1020
01:46:12.72 --> 01:46:19.04
drawing nearer I saw that it was the roasted body of a man in the sitting position he must have

1021
01:46:19.04 --> 01:46:24.96
been driving a scout car or light vehicle as there were small pieces of charred twisted metal

1022
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:32.40
spread fifty feet around with dismembered arms and legs torn and blood soaked uniforms

1023
01:46:32.40 --> 01:46:40.48
littering the black scorched soil the aroma was diabolical someone accidentally brushed the

1024
01:46:40.48 --> 01:46:52.48
sitting form on passing and the body simply disintegrated with a sickly sound fast forwarding a bit

1025
01:46:52.48 --> 01:46:59.20
the smell of burnt flesh coated in my direction and I quickly and I quick into my pace to get

1026
01:46:59.20 --> 01:47:05.76
clear of it plotting on in these awful humid and dusty conditions I think I felt almost immune

1027
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:13.04
to wearing this and the shocking sights of war nothing seemed to be able to stop us now

1028
01:47:17.04 --> 01:47:22.40
and this is again you got to read this book but this site sort of concludes this section the first

1029
01:47:22.40 --> 01:47:29.04
parachute brigade group was not destined to take part in the final push to tuna's our role

1030
01:47:29.04 --> 01:47:37.20
in the campaign had come to an end and we were withdrawn from the line so ending five months hard

1031
01:47:37.20 --> 01:47:43.68
slog and again that we were just burning through this book and I'm skipping so many sections

1032
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:51.68
this stuff is this is five months this is half a year just about of this type of fighting

1033
01:47:51.68 --> 01:47:58.64
originally trained as shock troops in Tunisia after the initial parachute assaults

1034
01:47:58.64 --> 01:48:03.28
we had served as plain infantry but that's just the way the wind blew for us

1035
01:48:04.40 --> 01:48:10.16
metals were plentiful and all ranks had earned them eight distinguished service orders

1036
01:48:10.16 --> 01:48:17.12
15 military crosses nine distinguished conduct metals 22 military metals

1037
01:48:17.12 --> 01:48:29.60
three raw digger and one legion to honor in their own way even our German adversaries had

1038
01:48:29.60 --> 01:48:37.44
recognized the brigades fighting ability by naming us the red devils for those who are there

1039
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:47.84
though the price of success was unspeakably high we had lost more than 1700 men killed wounded

1040
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:59.76
or missing so again I hate to burn through five months of insane fighting

1041
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:10.64
and I'll take a dig at red right now like he's so matter of fact about stuff and he only

1042
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:15.68
hits on the high points I'm hitting on the high points of the high points right just insane

1043
01:49:16.56 --> 01:49:24.80
insane to think about that for five months so from there they're transported from Tunisia

1044
01:49:24.80 --> 01:49:32.56
back to Algeria and they spend time training for a drop into Sicily a parachute drop

1045
01:49:32.56 --> 01:49:37.44
in Sicily which once again you're fighting in Africa look it's really tough conditions in

1046
01:49:37.44 --> 01:49:42.80
Africa now you're getting closer to Germany like you're going into going into Sicily you know

1047
01:49:42.80 --> 01:49:50.24
what's waiting for you it was hoped that if Sicily could be taken it might prompt an Italian

1048
01:49:50.24 --> 01:49:54.96
surrender a large proportion of my battalion including myself now went down with this entry

1049
01:49:57.76 --> 01:50:02.40
goes in and talking about a lot of that this is no this is just it's like no nothing's easy

1050
01:50:04.16 --> 01:50:09.04
between exercises we acclimat acclimatized our reinforcements to use every

1051
01:50:10.64 --> 01:50:15.44
they're used every type of enemy weapons including Schmeizer automatic which we found superior to our own

1052
01:50:15.44 --> 01:50:25.92
standgun so now they start preparing for this mission in Sicily there were three bridges to take

1053
01:50:25.92 --> 01:50:35.44
in Sicily and the password for them was to be desert rats with the reply kill Italians

1054
01:50:37.92 --> 01:50:41.68
as the plane took off chunky said well this is it our second operation

1055
01:50:41.68 --> 01:50:48.16
I tried to act normally but could feel the sweat running down my cheek so once again he's

1056
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:55.04
stifling some emotions in here they go getting on this getting ready to do this drop

1057
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:05.44
and this is just it's just crazy as we drew nearer to our objective and at a thousand feet

1058
01:51:05.44 --> 01:51:12.32
I could see the flack and tracer zipping past the wing of the aircraft for 30 minutes we

1059
01:51:12.32 --> 01:51:17.36
dodged everything they threw at us but it was a tens half hour as we were helpless to do anything

1060
01:51:18.80 --> 01:51:24.08
so you're in an airplane you're getting ready to parachute and there's flack bombs exploding around

1061
01:51:24.08 --> 01:51:29.44
you trying to take down your aircraft and tracer fires zipping but you know how much protection

1062
01:51:29.44 --> 01:51:39.20
an aircraft gives you from tracer fire from machine gunfire zero what's flack so it's anti-aircraft

1063
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:43.52
they set it for a certain altitude it goes up in the air and then just blows up in hopes that

1064
01:51:43.52 --> 01:51:47.76
some of that shrapnel will hit the aircraft and damage the aircraft and take them down

1065
01:51:47.76 --> 01:51:57.04
so flack jacket is to roll it so flack actually flack is just little chunks of its fragmentation

1066
01:51:57.04 --> 01:52:05.04
right all chunks of metal that that come off of explosive device that could grenade or a artillery

1067
01:52:05.04 --> 01:52:10.64
round that's going to blow up like on purpose yes that's what it for and then a flack jacket

1068
01:52:10.64 --> 01:52:16.16
is to protect you from flack good yeah and in the old days like the flack the term

1069
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:20.80
flack jacket the flack jacket would protect you from flack it wouldn't protect you from a bullet

1070
01:52:20.80 --> 01:52:27.84
because flack isn't going as fast as a bullet is so like an old school Vietnam flack jacket

1071
01:52:27.84 --> 01:52:32.64
wouldn't stop bullets but it would protect you from flack yeah like motorcycle jacket kind of thing

1072
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:38.72
like it's like it'll it'll protect you but not from the real deal yeah yeah yeah so even

1073
01:52:38.72 --> 01:52:43.84
so even nowadays right the expression like don't give me any flack it's like kind of that yeah yeah

1074
01:52:43.84 --> 01:52:50.32
exactly yeah exactly what it is so these guys are up there and like he says helpless

1075
01:52:50.32 --> 01:52:55.12
and by the way this is a half an hour of this

1076
01:52:55.68 --> 01:53:00.32
suddenly we were given continuing suddenly we were given the order to hook up I did so

1077
01:53:00.32 --> 01:53:05.04
and waited the engines cut back on the approach to our drops on we descended to around 600 feet

1078
01:53:05.04 --> 01:53:09.60
with all sorts of rubbish whizzing by and the plane pitching and tossing like a toy in a vast

1079
01:53:09.60 --> 01:53:17.76
vacuum then there came a terrific explosion as our tail was hit the order jump man jumped

1080
01:53:18.24 --> 01:53:25.92
screamed in my ears and I tumble through the doorway into the void below so they are craft finally

1081
01:53:25.92 --> 01:53:30.64
takes a devastating hit he doesn't he doesn't mention whether the aircraft made it or not he just

1082
01:53:30.64 --> 01:53:35.68
says that it you know the tail was hit hard I can't imagine that's super easy to fly a plane

1083
01:53:35.68 --> 01:53:42.40
what's the tail's been blown off now he gets on the ground again fast forward a little bit

1084
01:53:42.40 --> 01:53:48.40
on the ground about 300 yards in my left was the main coastal road to the town of

1085
01:53:49.36 --> 01:53:57.92
Katania and enemy traffic wasn't tremendous confusion to my rear I could hear Italian voices

1086
01:53:57.92 --> 01:54:03.84
and about a hundred yards to my right Germans wrapping out orders then now the road came a 15

1087
01:54:03.84 --> 01:54:09.04
strong German patrol they could have been parachutists judging by their dress and head gear

1088
01:54:09.04 --> 01:54:14.40
fortunately I was not alone when they were just a few yards off and we opened up on them

1089
01:54:15.44 --> 01:54:21.44
there were some grunts, groans and sickly yelps then silence we slipped on in the direction of the

1090
01:54:21.44 --> 01:54:27.04
bridge around which our men were by now silently killing harassing and panicking the German

1091
01:54:27.04 --> 01:54:35.20
Italian defenders at night small battles raged unceasingly and we were pinned down for a long

1092
01:54:35.20 --> 01:54:40.56
time by mortar fire when daylight broke though I saw the for the first time the vast mountain scenery

1093
01:54:40.56 --> 01:54:46.72
at the base of which we had been fighting again I'm just jumping through stuff then the sun starts

1094
01:54:46.72 --> 01:54:54.16
to come up it became warm and then the heat became intense a typical you're never you can never just

1095
01:54:54.16 --> 01:54:59.36
be comfortable it's always like freezing cold or too hot you would you he had 15 minutes where

1096
01:54:59.36 --> 01:55:04.72
it was warm and then they were too hot there had been no firing for some time and I realized that

1097
01:55:04.72 --> 01:55:09.28
the enemy was no longer with us scanning the countryside I could see burnt out cars Italian tanks

1098
01:55:09.28 --> 01:55:15.20
and ammunition dumps the smell of burnt bodies and oil filled the air I was glad to move on

1099
01:55:15.20 --> 01:55:22.08
such a confusion of our brigade such was the confusion of our brigade drop that come daylight

1100
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:27.76
three men from the men from three parah discovered they spent all night fighting alongside the

1101
01:55:27.76 --> 01:55:34.32
men of first pair without realizing it at the bridge it was clear that there had been a fierce battle

1102
01:55:34.32 --> 01:55:41.20
the pill boxes had been rushed and dealt with ruthlessly here the brigade mustard approximately

1103
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:46.16
180 men but the three inch mortars in ammunition had not arrived and there was a lack of communication

1104
01:55:46.16 --> 01:55:52.40
without side units wireless sets those are radios had been either incorrectly netted back in

1105
01:55:52.40 --> 01:55:58.64
Africa were damaged on the landing or just did not arrive we learned that German parachutists

1106
01:55:58.64 --> 01:56:05.92
from the third regiment of the first fallshemierger division had dropped simultaneously on our

1107
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:12.16
drops on the previous night so we must have indeed have brushed shoulders with them when we

1108
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:18.80
came upon that 50 man patrol how crazy is that you're jumping into a drop zone and the

1109
01:56:18.80 --> 01:56:28.40
Germans are jumping in there too and then he grows as things start to escalate he's talking

1110
01:56:28.40 --> 01:56:36.16
around how hot it was like hot as in not heat temperature but hot as in enemy action little

1111
01:56:36.16 --> 01:56:41.36
wonder things were so warm the area within an approximately two mile radius of the bridge was

1112
01:56:41.36 --> 01:56:47.52
festoon with 88 millimeter and 20 millimeter guns pill boxes machine gun pits and also a few

1113
01:56:47.52 --> 01:56:53.52
coastal guns and we were engaging with crack German troop including pair troops they presented a good

1114
01:56:53.52 --> 01:56:58.56
target whenever they got too near the bridge you could not miss but word run around that our supply

1115
01:56:58.56 --> 01:57:05.12
of ammunition was now drastically low conserve ammunition in fire only when you are absolutely certain

1116
01:57:05.12 --> 01:57:12.88
of a kill was the order but do in due course members of the first and third pair of battalions

1117
01:57:12.88 --> 01:57:18.24
at the northern end of the bridge with Drew to join us at the southern end the enemy was getting

1118
01:57:18.24 --> 01:57:28.08
harder to ward off as tanks and tanks began to appear now we got tanks enemy tanks on the scene

1119
01:57:28.64 --> 01:57:34.000
we were using captured Italian 40 millimeter anti tank gun along with our own anti tank gun

1120
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.40
the battle worked up to a terrific climax the Germans were sending their best troops in an effort to

1121
01:57:38.40 --> 01:57:44.72
shift us their pair of troopers probing for weak spots and allowing no respite food was in our

1122
01:57:44.72 --> 01:57:50.40
haversax but there was no time to get it it was fire fire and keep on firing finally there was a

1123
01:57:50.40 --> 01:57:56.24
wall at about 1830 or soon after giving us a chance to take stock maybe the Germans wanted to

1124
01:57:56.24 --> 01:58:01.60
regroup I checked my ammunition and found only four rounds left plus one in the chamber

1125
01:58:01.60 --> 01:58:09.44
at 1930 we were ordered to withdraw in order to avoid capture and go in small groups we made it off

1126
01:58:09.44 --> 01:58:18.000
in a westernly direction toward the gona loung the gona lunga river if we could use the river

1127
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.64
and the road running parallel to it as a guide for a couple miles perhaps then we could be

1128
01:58:22.64 --> 01:58:28.48
clear of any enemy concentrated attack so these guys are basically bagging out of the area

1129
01:58:28.48 --> 01:58:36.16
and as they're doing their doing in small groups at one point as darkness fell we came upon a

1130
01:58:36.16 --> 01:58:40.96
deserted farmhouse but decided not to enter as it was quite near an abandoned flat gun pit

1131
01:58:40.96 --> 01:58:45.84
we thought both sides would be we thought both could be booby trapped it was approximately

1132
01:58:45.84 --> 01:58:51.76
zero 200 by now we were very tired in hungry we dosed off in an orchard 20 feet from the edge

1133
01:58:51.76 --> 01:58:57.76
each man at the base of a different tree so as to be less conspicuous so they spend the night in this

1134
01:58:57.76 --> 01:59:06.96
orchard and then they set off once again we saw no more of the enemy via lentini

1135
01:59:08.16 --> 01:59:15.28
we reached Augusta some 50 miles from Primisol Bridge finding the town in our hands it was a great

1136
01:59:15.28 --> 01:59:23.92
site to see so many of our own troops and tanks and so they continue on reaching Syracuse without

1137
01:59:23.92 --> 01:59:30.40
miss hop on this on the 17th of July just four days after dropping in Sicily we soon set sail

1138
01:59:30.40 --> 01:59:38.48
arriving back at Sous in Tunisia on the 20th our first parachute brigade group had not only suffered

1139
01:59:38.48 --> 01:59:45.60
heavily in the North African campaign but in Sicily too where we had lost a further 300 men killed

1140
01:59:45.60 --> 01:59:53.76
wounded or missing it was time to rest refit regroup and reorganized and we also

1141
01:59:53.76 --> 02:00:03.60
got to relax so I mean this this is a group of men that are now just hardened combat

1142
02:00:04.40 --> 02:00:13.20
that's and yet there's no war there's no end to this in sight right I mean there's no end

1143
02:00:16.40 --> 02:00:20.80
hey I guess if you looked at it from a strategic perspective knowing what we know today maybe you

1144
02:00:20.80 --> 02:00:26.88
could say there's an end in sight but if you know you're barely surviving this you're barely

1145
02:00:26.88 --> 02:00:31.20
surviving it you know what the end is I mean you have to accept what the end is probably in a

1146
02:00:31.20 --> 02:00:40.08
big the end is probably gonna be you're not gonna live in early November we were told that the whole

1147
02:00:40.08 --> 02:00:43.68
first airborne division was returning to England and the first parachute brigade would leave

1148
02:00:43.68 --> 02:00:50.64
from Algiers at the end of the month on the 29th of September we shipped out of Algiers

1149
02:00:50.64 --> 02:00:59.36
on the SS Samaria happily heading for Liverpool now one particular chap made a popular appearance

1150
02:01:00.64 --> 02:01:10.000
Peter the battalions unofficial lovable dog Peter liked water and jumping from planes and was the

1151
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:18.48
only parachute dog on record at first he was owned by a lad named topor brown and rumor had it

1152
02:01:18.48 --> 02:01:24.40
they had both escaped from Dunkirk in 1940 Peter was a marvel and could do almost anything

1153
02:01:24.40 --> 02:01:30.16
asked of him never forgetting a trick put a stone on his nose and back away and he'd remain motionless

1154
02:01:31.12 --> 02:01:39.28
but at a given command he would toss and catch that stone water was his god there had been static

1155
02:01:39.28 --> 02:01:45.04
tanks eight feet deep at bullford into which a stone could be thrown Peter would retrieve it no time

1156
02:01:45.04 --> 02:01:52.08
and then sit patiently waiting for another run when we had set off from North Africa in October

1157
02:01:52.08 --> 02:01:58.16
the previous year he had been smuggled aboard the a run the castle everyone helping in the

1158
02:01:58.16 --> 02:02:06.32
scheming to get him aboard and keep him fed exercised and comfortable he had been left behind in Algieria

1159
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:10.88
in the good care of the cooks and the rear echelon party when we went on to meet the enemy in

1160
02:02:10.88 --> 02:02:17.44
Tunisia where topor brown was taken prisoner and sadly never heard of again

1161
02:02:18.96 --> 02:02:24.40
corporal Jim Nash the battalion hairdresser of our company then took care of Peter

1162
02:02:25.04 --> 02:02:31.36
and is it was at mate more in Algieria during training for the Sicily operation that Jim took him

1163
02:02:31.36 --> 02:02:36.72
up for his first jump from an aircraft a special bag had been made who was fixed to Jim's front

1164
02:02:36.72 --> 02:02:44.16
with a hole at the top for Peter's head to protrude they made a perfect landing Peter running off as

1165
02:02:44.16 --> 02:02:51.52
happy as Larry wagging his tail after various other escapades Peter returned to Algieria's and was

1166
02:02:51.52 --> 02:02:58.80
smuggled aboard the Samaria where he was having a great time until the locker door of his hiding

1167
02:02:58.80 --> 02:03:04.40
place was accidentally left unsecured during one of our boat drill procedures and he ventured out on

1168
02:03:04.40 --> 02:03:11.92
his own he was found wandering below by the ship's officer who ordered him to be put over the side

1169
02:03:13.44 --> 02:03:20.24
we were just two days out from Liverpool the men were furious and it was just as well that the

1170
02:03:20.24 --> 02:03:25.92
officer responsible could not be found as a roving band of justice seeking Paris could not have been

1171
02:03:25.92 --> 02:03:34.80
expected to be lenient as far as Peter was concerned he had such enthusiasm for water that maybe

1172
02:03:34.80 --> 02:03:41.92
he was fitting to end up in a sea grave but we felt as loss I don't mind admitting that we fighting

1173
02:03:41.92 --> 02:03:50.32
men had a soft side even after all we'd seen and done perhaps especially after all we'd seen

1174
02:03:50.32 --> 02:04:03.44
and done I wrote Peter a poem entitled Epitaph to a friend it's last verse as follows Peter made us

1175
02:04:03.44 --> 02:04:12.08
happy and carefree he had no military apparel he made just two jumps his grave is the sea

1176
02:04:12.08 --> 02:04:27.28
his wings truly earned and the name red devil kind of a theme that we see come up from time to time

1177
02:04:28.56 --> 02:04:35.60
the attachment that soldiers can get to these to these dogs that they they come across at some point

1178
02:04:35.60 --> 02:04:46.64
and unfortunately recurring theme is some rear echelon person doesn't understand killing those animals

1179
02:04:51.20 --> 02:04:55.76
and I also thought it was you know it's interesting that line I don't mind admitting that

1180
02:04:55.76 --> 02:05:01.36
we fighting men had a soft side even after all we'd seen and done and they says perhaps especially

1181
02:05:01.36 --> 02:05:09.52
after all we'd seen and done that's something that is I mean I think that's absolutely true you know you

1182
02:05:10.80 --> 02:05:16.64
there's no better there's the sunset looks a million times that infinitely better when you know

1183
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:22.96
the sacrifices that have been made to see the sunset the white bedsheets that you get to sleep on

1184
02:05:22.96 --> 02:05:29.52
you appreciate infinitely more when you've been sleeping in the dirt for six months and it goes on and on and on

1185
02:05:29.52 --> 02:05:36.24
then so when you see when you see the depravity that that human beings are capable of

1186
02:05:38.40 --> 02:05:45.36
well that can actually expose the fact that you really can cherish all innocent

1187
02:05:46.88 --> 02:05:47.84
let us in a little dog

1188
02:05:47.84 --> 02:06:06.08
and these guys arrived back home get stationed the first battalion get stationed at

1189
02:06:06.08 --> 02:06:12.72
Grim's Thorpe Castle and at this point they know something really big is in the air

1190
02:06:12.72 --> 02:06:20.24
and he says here in August men coming from our old training area of Tatten Park

1191
02:06:20.24 --> 02:06:25.84
reported seeing thousands of tanks there like a giant tank park sure enough in mid-September

1192
02:06:25.84 --> 02:06:33.36
we were finally setting off somewhere I checked over my gear one gammon bomb two dot three six

1193
02:06:33.36 --> 02:06:39.04
hand grenades combined pick and shovel webbing equipment with small pack two ammunition pouches

1194
02:06:39.04 --> 02:06:45.60
and bandlear with three oh three ammunition water bottle mess tin iron ration field dressing

1195
02:06:45.60 --> 02:06:51.36
camouflage net scarf triangle shape air recognition bright yellow silk scarf tied around the neck

1196
02:06:51.36 --> 02:06:58.80
for ready for instant use rifle and an escape kit comprising of a silk map of Europe a small

1197
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:04.64
button compass and a strong file the size of a nail file that was about it except for a

1198
02:07:04.64 --> 02:07:09.92
kit bag strap to the leg and parachute plus may-west life jacket in case we finished up in the

1199
02:07:09.92 --> 02:07:14.80
drink I felt like an overdue pregnant hippo and didn't know where to put anything else

1200
02:07:15.44 --> 02:07:20.40
though still I added 200 cigarettes two bars of chocolate and some boiled sweets

1201
02:07:22.96 --> 02:07:33.20
it's interesting the yellow scarf for recognition and he specifically says tied around the neck for

1202
02:07:33.20 --> 02:07:38.64
instant use and it's interesting we we kind of I always carried one the basic reason why I

1203
02:07:38.64 --> 02:07:45.84
was carried one because I was a radio man when I was a young and listed guy and I used it at times

1204
02:07:45.84 --> 02:07:54.32
I had learned the value of it signaling helicopters and signaling boats in the jungle like if you

1205
02:07:54.32 --> 02:08:00.72
and the weird thing is you when you're in a boat let's say you're in a river along the jungle

1206
02:08:00.72 --> 02:08:05.60
there's so much jungle to look at that it's really hard to see someone waving their hand like

1207
02:08:05.60 --> 02:08:10.16
it seems so obvious when you're waving at some waving at a boat hey hey I'm over here the

1208
02:08:10.16 --> 02:08:13.76
first of all they can't hear you because they're running engines shoot machine guns they can't hear you

1209
02:08:14.72 --> 02:08:20.88
and second because they're looking at whatever quarter mile or half a mile of green

1210
02:08:21.68 --> 02:08:26.32
bush they got this whole thing to try and find you and you're in a green camouflage uniform

1211
02:08:26.32 --> 02:08:32.000
and you're waving your they can't see you so you need I would always have a aircraft panels what we

1212
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.24
call them aircraft sing with panel which is just bright fluorescent orange and I could whip that

1213
02:08:36.24 --> 02:08:41.52
thing out really quickly and then it then you become a lot more visible same thing with the aircraft

1214
02:08:41.52 --> 02:08:47.68
overhead well in a body it didn't take long before everyone was carrying that because and they were

1215
02:08:47.68 --> 02:08:51.68
carrying big ones too like a platoon or like an element that was going in a building would have a

1216
02:08:51.68 --> 02:08:57.12
big giant one that you could hang out a window everyone we are here hey friendly forces we are here

1217
02:08:58.72 --> 02:09:06.48
so even this guy World War II that bright yellow silk scarf in important signaling device at the hand

1218
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:13.52
he says I I wondered how the rest of the men were going to fare on this hop

1219
02:09:13.52 --> 02:09:23.52
I was just getting used to the new faces like Frankie Panzer Manzer Bill Silberry Terry Brace Dick

1220
02:09:23.52 --> 02:09:34.56
Bingley Dolly Gray major parent brown Sid Oxley Guv Beach with his top hat the Germans

1221
02:09:35.76 --> 02:09:42.000
will surrender in surprise if he takes him with that I thought Joe McReedy patty McCormick

1222
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:51.28
and Captain Joe Gardner that mean just I just had to read those names for two reasons number one

1223
02:09:51.28 --> 02:09:56.56
because they sound like the best bunch of characters you could ever hang around and also so everyone

1224
02:09:56.56 --> 02:10:01.52
remembers that all these people that we're talking about they're all people

1225
02:10:01.52 --> 02:10:11.44
unfortunately sergeant Busty Everett had fallen ill and died at Born

1226
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:18.56
we were from all over the country and beyond and on the whole one big happy family

1227
02:10:19.44 --> 02:10:24.88
it was daylight when we clambered into trucks and headed toward the arrow drone at Barxton Hall

1228
02:10:24.88 --> 02:10:37.12
everyone was tense but ready to go come what may he goes on here our objective was to capture

1229
02:10:37.12 --> 02:10:45.04
and hold the bridge straddling the rine at our nm my first parachute patty and was to seize the

1230
02:10:45.04 --> 02:10:50.80
high ground to the north our escorting typhoon spit fire and Mustang fighters were weaving

1231
02:10:50.80 --> 02:10:55.92
between the decodes and gliders as we cross the English channel tension began to mount in my

1232
02:10:55.92 --> 02:11:00.32
plane we approach land on the other side and could see the area that had been flooded to try and

1233
02:11:00.32 --> 02:11:05.12
stop her and peed the advance of our land forces i was admiring the landscape when the order

1234
02:11:05.12 --> 02:11:13.60
rang out action stations hook up green light on go being number 13 night a few long seconds to

1235
02:11:13.60 --> 02:11:18.08
wait as I shuffled forward then i felt a slight pat on my parachute back and again found myself

1236
02:11:18.08 --> 02:11:23.92
tumbling out of the doorway into that familiar open void my parachute opened once more obediently

1237
02:11:24.56 --> 02:11:28.96
and i drifted down to earth without difficulty after a good three point landing i was now an

1238
02:11:28.96 --> 02:11:34.08
enemy occupied territory except for the occasional machine gun fire and some blasting from enemy

1239
02:11:34.08 --> 02:11:39.60
machine gun placements the landing had been unopposed and the whole dropping north zone north of

1240
02:11:39.60 --> 02:11:45.28
he'slam was packed with gliders and discarded parachutes everyone soon collected themselves

1241
02:11:45.28 --> 02:11:53.04
and rendezvous to their perspective points the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of

1242
02:11:53.04 --> 02:12:01.84
September 1944 the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of September 1944

1243
02:12:04.88 --> 02:12:09.68
leaving the drops on we made a way quickly along the track running alongside the wood

1244
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:16.40
west of wolfhees and south of the railway the end of the track lined up with a road running parallel

1245
02:12:16.40 --> 02:12:21.92
to the railway turning right here and then over the road onto the railway sidewalk we noticed our

1246
02:12:21.92 --> 02:12:31.28
way toward wolfhees station suddenly there was a loud explosion up ahead and some machine gun fire

1247
02:12:31.28 --> 02:12:41.28
and now this is when things start to get hot our company still upfront became engaged in a fierce

1248
02:12:41.28 --> 02:12:46.96
battle facing armored cars, mortars and machine guns it was getting dark now the whole

1249
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:53.12
battalion laid doggo for a while to try to avoid further detection we lay up in the woods for

1250
02:12:53.12 --> 02:13:00.96
some hours pushing on occasionally buck cautiously at one point in time unbeknown to the enemy they

1251
02:13:00.96 --> 02:13:07.76
completely surrounded us in the semi dirt so here they are they're kind of like laid up they're not

1252
02:13:07.76 --> 02:13:12.96
trying to move too much in the semi dark we passed down winding lanes this is when they start

1253
02:13:12.96 --> 02:13:19.84
pushing forward through the woods and along the south side of the road we were now about five miles

1254
02:13:19.84 --> 02:13:26.56
from the arndam bridge and so far luck had been with us at about two o'clock in the morning there

1255
02:13:26.56 --> 02:13:32.64
were sounds a battle ahead apparently coming from an area north east north northeast of Lichtenbeek

1256
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.92
on arriving there at about 0-500 we found that the leading companies had met fierce opposition

1257
02:13:39.92 --> 02:13:46.64
and it suffered heavily then with no reason given at the time the original plan to go for the

1258
02:13:46.64 --> 02:13:54.24
high ground north of arndam was changed and we instead turned south towards marion doll

1259
02:13:54.24 --> 02:14:01.04
an asterbeek some two miles from the bridge at 0-600 we entered asterbeek

1260
02:14:02.48 --> 02:14:07.68
where we met members of the Dutch underground movement who showed us the easiest route to the bridge

1261
02:14:09.44 --> 02:14:14.72
we were moving cautiously in a file ready for action and everything seemed a little bit too quiet

1262
02:14:14.72 --> 02:14:20.96
at 0-630 as dawn was breaking we moved up into a built up area and then it started

1263
02:14:21.52 --> 02:14:25.92
the enemy had been busy overnight preparing gun emplacements taking up positions at vantage

1264
02:14:25.92 --> 02:14:34.16
points posting snipers and concealing tanks and SP guns German gunfire shattered the piece and I

1265
02:14:34.16 --> 02:14:38.72
darted for cover and took up position in the neatly laid out garden of a nearby house

1266
02:14:38.72 --> 02:14:43.84
more firing came from the house direction with two other men I ran around the back of the house

1267
02:14:43.84 --> 02:14:50.96
and fired as two Germans in the shrubbery they must have had their chips with two other men

1268
02:14:50.96 --> 02:14:55.76
I round around the back of the house and fired at two Germans in the shrubbery they must have

1269
02:14:55.76 --> 02:15:01.84
had their chips amid the smoke and fire of machine guns SP guns and six barrel mortars the

1270
02:15:01.84 --> 02:15:08.32
battle ranged the battle raged and built to such a pitch that I became quite accustomed to it

1271
02:15:08.32 --> 02:15:15.68
and went about the task as if on street fighting training back in home we hadn't eaten since

1272
02:15:15.68 --> 02:15:21.12
leaving England but I was too busy to be hungry casualties were mounting mounting incredibly fast

1273
02:15:21.12 --> 02:15:26.56
and in every direction I could see motionless forms of our men cut down in their tracks

1274
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:31.92
progress was slow and the battle became more intense as the bridge loomed gradually nearer

1275
02:15:33.20 --> 02:15:37.04
with two other chaps I did not know I chased after some Germans in a house

1276
02:15:37.04 --> 02:15:40.72
we threw a grenade in and dashed to the door to finish them off with stand and rifle

1277
02:15:41.68 --> 02:15:46.24
looking around for any more of the enemy we were built we built it to the rear of the house

1278
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:51.60
I tripped over a broken fence and went sprawling as I scrambled up I heard a close wine and

1279
02:15:51.60 --> 02:15:58.24
recognized which I recognized was a mortar I die for cover by a low wall and the bomb landed very near

1280
02:15:58.24 --> 02:16:03.60
near enough to feel the draft snipers were taking pot shots at us dodging and weaving through

1281
02:16:03.60 --> 02:16:09.84
gardens and backyards I came to stop at an opposite of factory held up by held up by a heavy

1282
02:16:09.84 --> 02:16:16.72
mortar machine gun fire yet again I threw myself into the ground it was absolute bedlam

1283
02:16:17.44 --> 02:16:23.36
with the slicing sound of German southern solar their guns their bullets cutting their

1284
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:30.72
in every direction and the repeated spark of mortars followed by the wine and sound of hot

1285
02:16:30.72 --> 02:16:37.20
shrapnel hitting the rooftops a small lump lump of shrapnel hit my helmet sounding like a pee on a drum

1286
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.36
in a heat of battle men were shouting curses lobbying grenades through open doors and windows

1287
02:16:43.36 --> 02:16:48.24
and following up with shrieks of contempt for the enemy and a cry of woo hoo Muhammad

1288
02:16:49.76 --> 02:16:55.92
casualties really began mounting there were groans from men who had been hit motionless perilous

1289
02:16:55.92 --> 02:17:01.60
motionless perilous lay in the road and slumped over walls I saw a pair of feet protruding from a

1290
02:17:01.60 --> 02:17:08.48
garden gateway one boat one boot blown off but leaving the foot complete such as the magical

1291
02:17:08.48 --> 02:17:17.12
phenomenon of war the German fire power was murderous and all I could do was keep alert for the sound

1292
02:17:17.12 --> 02:17:28.48
of English I had a horrible feeling that my battalion was being cut to ribbons going forward a

1293
02:17:28.48 --> 02:17:32.48
little bit there was a heck of a battle going on inside the factory and men were scrapping

1294
02:17:32.48 --> 02:17:38.80
furiously with grenade stins called handguns and fighting knives the wall of the house opposite

1295
02:17:38.80 --> 02:17:43.44
received a blast of machine gun fire coming from behind me I was about to move off and pursuit of a

1296
02:17:43.44 --> 02:17:50.88
German in the garden of a terrorist house on the on my right when I felt an explosion just beneath me

1297
02:17:51.52 --> 02:17:58.000
and a sharp pain. Reeling over and looking down I saw that the lower part of my right leg was in a

1298
02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:04.08
most unusual position and blood was oozing out steady and fast I shouted for help and two

1299
02:18:04.08 --> 02:18:11.52
paras dashed up quickly and rendered first aid one of them sergeant knobby hall called for medical

1300
02:18:11.52 --> 02:18:19.44
orderly I was worried but felt like a nuisance as everyone was busy enough already without being

1301
02:18:19.44 --> 02:18:25.20
lumbered with me I was placed on a way I was placed on a stretcher and carried into a wooden

1302
02:18:25.20 --> 02:18:30.64
shed a few yards away where medics cut the boot off of the foot of my shattered leg smashed by an

1303
02:18:30.64 --> 02:18:38.08
explosive bullet it looked awful but strangely I didn't feel much pain they tore open the field dressing

1304
02:18:38.08 --> 02:18:44.80
I had carried for so long in different parts the world but never previously needed and carried out a

1305
02:18:44.80 --> 02:18:50.88
quick but thorough job pandemonium was raining outside as machine so at this point obviously he's been

1306
02:18:50.88 --> 02:18:59.12
wounded he's been wounded really bad his leg is in very rough shape he can't walk pandemonium was

1307
02:18:59.12 --> 02:19:04.88
raining outside as machine gun fire echoed around the built up area a mortar bomb landed quite near

1308
02:19:04.88 --> 02:19:11.12
but the medic administrating a more-feet injection kept a steady hand as if he were in the safety

1309
02:19:11.12 --> 02:19:18.24
of a hospital back in England so the talk about detaching the medic is just cool and calm

1310
02:19:20.32 --> 02:19:24.64
while the other medic hunted around for suitable makeshift splint a young Dutch girl appeared

1311
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:29.28
from nowhere and offered me a welcome cup of water I was feeling cold and clammy and her help

1312
02:19:29.28 --> 02:19:35.12
was a great comfort as was the morphine which soon began to take effect there was another series of

1313
02:19:35.12 --> 02:19:41.92
explosions just ahead a clear signal to get moving and I was carried cautiously to the corner of

1314
02:19:41.92 --> 02:19:47.44
a house next to the road I'd come down only a short while ago everyone was scattered

1315
02:19:48.64 --> 02:19:54.16
everyone was scattered and there were dead paras in the road on the sidewalk and in the gardens

1316
02:19:54.16 --> 02:19:59.76
snipers were busy and our men were bent on winkling them out there was a thud a whiz and a bark

1317
02:19:59.76 --> 02:20:04.24
of an exploding shell followed by another and another all bursting on the rooftops of houses

1318
02:20:04.24 --> 02:20:08.64
thirty yards back then something flash from an upper window only twenty yards ahead and bullets

1319
02:20:08.64 --> 02:20:13.36
splattered on the wall above us the medic set me down to wait for an opportune met moment to get

1320
02:20:13.36 --> 02:20:18.000
across the road and I saw four paras press themselves into the wall of the building opposite

1321
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.92
as they worked their way toward that flash went under the window the leading parac kick the

1322
02:20:23.92 --> 02:20:30.56
door out and out of the window came a potato masher which he immediately picked up and threw back

1323
02:20:30.56 --> 02:20:37.36
in the potato masher is the classic German grenade with a long handle on it which they did so

1324
02:20:37.36 --> 02:20:42.08
that they could throw grenades as far as as the Americans could because we play baseball and they

1325
02:20:42.08 --> 02:20:50.40
play soccer and you don't kick you don't kick grenades you have to throw them the leading parac

1326
02:20:50.40 --> 02:20:55.12
kick the door and out of the window came a potato masher which he immediately picked up and

1327
02:20:55.12 --> 02:20:59.84
threw back in a company by a mills bomb which is their grenade thrown by another man there was

1328
02:20:59.84 --> 02:21:04.96
quite some explosion following which four paras entered the building spring stand gun fire in the

1329
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:12.32
room and threw up through the floorboards a trick we had learned in training I was more than

1330
02:21:12.32 --> 02:21:16.56
relieved to get out of the line of fire was carried into the relative safety of a garden wall

1331
02:21:16.56 --> 02:21:21.20
as I laid helpless behind the wall I had a clear view of the clatter and confusion in the battle

1332
02:21:21.20 --> 02:21:29.84
and the through the demolished gateway so he goes on here obviously I'm not covering the whole

1333
02:21:29.84 --> 02:21:35.68
book but covering some sections of things that are unfolding I was moved with a number of

1334
02:21:35.68 --> 02:21:41.52
other wounded men to a nearby barn where I spent a fairly easy night thanks to the powerful effects

1335
02:21:41.52 --> 02:21:46.08
of the morphine injection I'd been given early the following morning all was reasonably quiet

1336
02:21:46.08 --> 02:21:51.04
in the immediate vicinity although I could hear the sound of battle not far off looking around the

1337
02:21:51.04 --> 02:21:57.12
barn I didn't recognize anyone from my first paty and and those men I spoke to did not want to

1338
02:21:57.12 --> 02:22:03.68
know they were either too preoccupied with their wounds or unable to talk at all some of them

1339
02:22:03.68 --> 02:22:08.96
looked as though they had just lived through a nightmare which I would say is an accurate statement

1340
02:22:08.96 --> 02:22:21.04
and again it's like everything that he's talking about is just you know complete mayhem combat

1341
02:22:21.04 --> 02:22:25.76
that's what he's talking about it's just totally out of control and finally it settles down a

1342
02:22:25.76 --> 02:22:30.16
little bit for that night and it sounds like maybe the probably the brits at that point

1343
02:22:30.16 --> 02:22:40.56
it done a good counter attack maybe established a perimeter unfortunately doesn't last at about 0700

1344
02:22:40.56 --> 02:22:46.64
two medics came up to me and said that my turn was next this is as they're trying to extract them

1345
02:22:47.36 --> 02:22:51.12
lifting the stretcher they carried me to a waiting Jeep it's engine running there were

1346
02:22:51.12 --> 02:22:55.44
four walking wounded in the back seat and I was strapped to the front of the bonnet alongside

1347
02:22:55.44 --> 02:23:02.08
another chap who was already strapped in on the on beside the what windscreen he forced to grin

1348
02:23:02.96 --> 02:23:09.20
what's yours I asked they got me in the guts he said bluntly that's a nasty place to cop it I

1349
02:23:09.20 --> 02:23:15.44
thought feeling sorry for him a short stocky medic jumped in the driver seat saying hold tight

1350
02:23:15.44 --> 02:23:20.32
in the back and don't worry you two in front on the bonnet we might have a rough ride and it will be a bit

1351
02:23:20.32 --> 02:23:33.44
fast what do you even do I mean they take you they put you on a stretcher on the hood of a

1352
02:23:33.44 --> 02:23:38.64
freaking Jeep and they're like and the medic says hold on to the guys in the back and says hey

1353
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:42.88
up front don't they've got them strapped down there's nothing they can do they can't move I wouldn't

1354
02:23:42.88 --> 02:23:49.92
want to do that on a Tuesday afternoon you know going to like to the market I mean imagine

1355
02:23:49.92 --> 02:23:53.68
I'm like hey I'm taking the market I put you on the hood of my car strap you down and say hey it's

1356
02:23:53.68 --> 02:24:02.56
going to be a little rough. After a fast fast forward after a fast bumpy journey the Jeep

1357
02:24:02.56 --> 02:24:08.72
tore through Usterbeek passed the net the original headquarters at the heart and steam hotel

1358
02:24:08.72 --> 02:24:14.24
and pulled up sharply in the drive of the taffled berigo tell a few hundred yards farther on

1359
02:24:14.24 --> 02:24:19.36
airborne medics quickly unstrap me and took me inside setting me down on the floor opposite a window

1360
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:26.48
in the entrance hall the hotel taffled berigo had been German field marshal walther model

1361
02:24:26.48 --> 02:24:32.56
modells headquarters prior to our arrival the previous Sunday and we were now using it as an improvised

1362
02:24:32.56 --> 02:24:38.40
military hospital it must have taken a few knocks as it was now in absolute shambles as usual

1363
02:24:39.20 --> 02:24:44.64
the British Tommy had managed to brew up even in such hazardous conditions and I was given a mug of

1364
02:24:44.64 --> 02:24:49.52
tea and a bar of chocolate my first foods in sleeping in England two days earlier I had not touched

1365
02:24:49.52 --> 02:24:54.80
my ghastly iron ration I tried to sleep but with the interruption of shelling and mortar fire

1366
02:24:54.80 --> 02:25:00.56
prevented that when night fell I just long for daylight to come again I hated the nights it was bad

1367
02:25:00.56 --> 02:25:08.000
enough to be meeting angry Germans in battle but it was worse to do so while I slept the next day

1368
02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Wednesday I was grateful to be taken into the operating room ingeniously rigged up in the kitchen

1369
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:22.40
of the hotel so he gets some he gets some preliminary worked on on his wounds and of course the

1370
02:25:22.40 --> 02:25:29.60
brits I know I've talked about this they like to brew up their tea and they will do it that's how they

1371
02:25:29.60 --> 02:25:35.04
roll I was returned to the entrance hall where the den of battle embolitating the wall outside

1372
02:25:35.04 --> 02:25:40.24
maybe look out I was surprised to be is to see a German wandering about so pictures is you're in a

1373
02:25:40.24 --> 02:25:45.44
hospital you just got like the shrapnel cut out your leg they sit taken set you down and now you're

1374
02:25:45.44 --> 02:25:52.16
watching the battle out of window and you see a German wandering around he took up a stand position

1375
02:25:52.16 --> 02:25:58.40
by the door and then began pacing up and down just then there was a loud crump outside and debris

1376
02:25:58.40 --> 02:26:04.24
plaster and glass fell all around I looked to see where that one landed and the German I had seen

1377
02:26:04.24 --> 02:26:10.000
outside only a few moments ago was now sprawled out killed I presumed by one of his own mortar bombs

1378
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.04
but that should tell you with a situation there there's Germans outside the window walking around

1379
02:26:17.84 --> 02:26:24.000
I was set down at the head of the stairs to my right leg glider pilot who had a face and arm injury

1380
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.92
amid all the wounded who covered most of the landing area came a wounded man walking our eyes met

1381
02:26:29.92 --> 02:26:35.68
did I know him I hardly knew anyone they were unrecognizable clotted up with blood and dirt

1382
02:26:35.68 --> 02:26:45.84
then up the stairs belted some combat paras and we asked them how it was going I had to

1383
02:26:45.84 --> 02:26:50.80
had to capture this because this is just as british as it gets so these there's like we just said

1384
02:26:50.80 --> 02:26:55.68
there's Germans walking around outside this places total shambles and they see a couple paras and he

1385
02:26:55.68 --> 02:27:02.72
says hey how's it going and one of the paras answers not too bad not too bad could be a bit better

1386
02:27:02.72 --> 02:27:10.40
before disappearing back down again that's like that's a no factor response yeah oh by the way

1387
02:27:10.40 --> 02:27:14.96
we're about to get overrun but not too bad not too good be better but you know we got this

1388
02:27:18.64 --> 02:27:22.96
fast forward a little bit a wounded man with his arm and a sling approached me with an inquiring look

1389
02:27:22.96 --> 02:27:29.52
what unit chum he asked almost in a whisper first pair I replied I'm in a shower of dust and smoke

1390
02:27:29.52 --> 02:27:35.36
as yet another shell exploded very near he went and withdrew from the direction of the shell blast

1391
02:27:36.48 --> 02:27:42.72
just as we felt the ominous vacuum of warm air he was almost incoherent as he glanced around the

1392
02:27:42.72 --> 02:27:49.12
terrible scene of man-made destruction I just left the bridge he said there was quite a pause what's

1393
02:27:49.12 --> 02:27:54.64
it like there I asked he swung around glaring at me as if the whole war was my fault his eyes

1394
02:27:54.64 --> 02:28:00.000
hard staring and red with fatigue the poor fellow had been hit through with something bad

1395
02:28:01.36 --> 02:28:06.40
I offered him a cigarette and with a trembling hand he took one it hung limping his grasp

1396
02:28:07.04 --> 02:28:12.56
thanks I don't really smoke but I'll have when he said then he answered it was bloody hell there

1397
02:28:12.56 --> 02:28:17.04
tanks belching fire blocks getting killed left and right the carnage was terrible

1398
02:28:18.40 --> 02:28:23.68
he paused as a medic passed by with a man clutching his side and hoveling on one leg a bloody

1399
02:28:23.68 --> 02:28:29.84
congealed bandage wrapped around the stump where once had been a foot my lad drew hard on the

1400
02:28:29.84 --> 02:28:36.48
cigarette and coughing continued there were hordes of them they went on for hours attacking

1401
02:28:36.48 --> 02:28:44.32
shelling then the bastard started burning us out my two mates got killed the twisted and broken

1402
02:28:44.32 --> 02:28:49.52
bodies of our men were strewn everywhere he leaned back against the wall looking a little

1403
02:28:49.52 --> 02:28:55.68
mortise I don't know but I think it may have been the first I may have been the first person he had

1404
02:28:55.68 --> 02:29:01.12
spelt out his experiences too they're he told me that it was his first time in action

1405
02:29:02.56 --> 02:29:09.68
I thought he had ridden it bloody well the next few days seemed to drag on forever with my leg

1406
02:29:09.68 --> 02:29:14.56
giving me much more pain now than it had during the first 24 hours after I was hit

1407
02:29:14.56 --> 02:29:22.16
and so obviously these guys are rallied up and they're suffering but it doesn't mean that

1408
02:29:22.16 --> 02:29:27.12
they're safe continuing on there are so many shells landing in on and around the building

1409
02:29:27.12 --> 02:29:31.84
plus the occasional burst of machine gun fire spattering the inner walls that I imagine we

1410
02:29:31.84 --> 02:29:37.52
must be slapped bang in in the front line or somewhere in no man's land by the way that's the

1411
02:29:37.52 --> 02:29:44.16
field hospital there were hundreds of wounded in enemy included as well as Dutch people caught up in the

1412
02:29:44.16 --> 02:29:49.84
fight so many that some got moved to the hotels and acts across the driveway and any man with

1413
02:29:49.84 --> 02:29:55.36
flesh wounds or injuries that did not hinder the use of a firearm was ordered outside to fight

1414
02:29:56.56 --> 02:30:03.92
so if you could fight now it's time it was now the 23rd of September and I was lying still

1415
02:30:03.92 --> 02:30:08.88
at the head of the broad stairway and there was commotion down below those ruddy hunds again

1416
02:30:08.88 --> 02:30:13.52
said the glider pilot there was a shuffling in German orders were being wrapped the out

1417
02:30:14.64 --> 02:30:21.28
then some SS troops dashed up the stairs a sinister looking type about 20 years old led the way

1418
02:30:21.28 --> 02:30:25.28
and was coming right out of it coming right at me I found myself looking straight down the barrel of his

1419
02:30:25.28 --> 02:30:30.64
schmizer his trigger finger shaking I didn't bat an eyelid I just did not want to have set

1420
02:30:30.64 --> 02:30:36.56
him and give him a cause to let rip he was glaring at me with red BDI's Christ this is it I thought

1421
02:30:37.92 --> 02:30:43.44
I had heard of other wounded being shot up but my luck was in any past me by he and two other

1422
02:30:43.44 --> 02:30:49.20
SS men had a good look around and took a and then took up firing positions at windows in rooms leading

1423
02:30:49.20 --> 02:30:55.52
off the landing as they started to fire out Colonel Warwick dast up the stairs swearing and

1424
02:30:55.52 --> 02:31:01.44
rebuking them for firing from a clearly marked red cross building discipline took over they look

1425
02:31:01.44 --> 02:31:06.24
to find and so on but with fingers handling their automatic's hesitantly they reluctantly obey

1426
02:31:06.24 --> 02:31:12.56
the officers command and stop firing so as I talked about early with the

1427
02:31:13.68 --> 02:31:19.04
and clearly these are some Germans that have respect for the law of armed conflict

1428
02:31:19.84 --> 02:31:24.72
and they there which let's just start with this we're in the hospital building and now we got

1429
02:31:24.72 --> 02:31:31.20
the the Germans in the building using it as a firing position I don't even know what to say about this

1430
02:31:32.24 --> 02:31:38.24
like what what is that even how do you even translate that into into reality your wounded your

1431
02:31:38.24 --> 02:31:44.72
your hospital is getting mortar to machine gun and then there's German enemy soldiers in your

1432
02:31:44.72 --> 02:31:56.40
building firing from inside your building walking around looking at you oh and he comments about this

1433
02:31:56.40 --> 02:32:00.24
it was most strange to have enemy in the building one minute only be replaced by your own combat

1434
02:32:00.24 --> 02:32:08.56
men the next so that's his statement about it is that yeah strange I wondered how the rest of

1435
02:32:08.56 --> 02:32:13.60
my first parabatian were doing right from the Sunday night our our company had a tough time

1436
02:32:13.60 --> 02:32:23.44
losing half of its men in the D lyridudal area then 40 men of six platoon as company were killed

1437
02:32:23.44 --> 02:32:32.08
in two minutes on the approach to Archnem Arnhem and in the denbrink St. Elizabeth's hospital

1438
02:32:32.08 --> 02:32:41.20
and factory area the rest of the battalion was badly mauled in the midst of it all father

1439
02:32:41.20 --> 02:32:47.20
Benson a Roman Catholic priest was busy making his rounds and answering urgent calls

1440
02:32:48.16 --> 02:32:55.28
one man so constantly needed things began to get on my nerves that morning

1441
02:32:57.76 --> 02:33:03.20
which is kind of interesting because he's been through all this stuff he's wounded

1442
02:33:03.20 --> 02:33:09.04
he's surrounded by the enemy he's on his whatever however many hundreds of days in close combat

1443
02:33:09.04 --> 02:33:15.28
that he's been in over the past few years and now that he's wounded and surrounded and there's

1444
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:19.68
men screaming and dying all around them things are getting on his nerves a little bit this morning

1445
02:33:20.72 --> 02:33:27.60
makes sense that's that's what that's what rages up to so things began to get on my nerves that

1446
02:33:27.60 --> 02:33:33.12
morning what with the continuous den of battle outside in my leg getting more painful through lack of

1447
02:33:33.12 --> 02:33:39.28
proper medical attention I called for father Benson to offer a few words of comfort so he came and put

1448
02:33:39.28 --> 02:33:45.68
me at my ease later he was too as wounded by tank fire into the building I'm sorry to say that he

1449
02:33:45.68 --> 02:33:54.48
died from those wounds and was buried in the grounds of St. Elizabeth's hospital on the following day

1450
02:33:54.48 --> 02:34:03.44
the disposition was frightening once again under statement the British under statement because

1451
02:34:03.44 --> 02:34:09.68
as far as I'm concerned everything up to this point is completely horrifying on the following day

1452
02:34:09.68 --> 02:34:15.52
the disposition was frightening our men were still doing their damnness but the Germans were slowly

1453
02:34:15.52 --> 02:34:20.88
closing in very slowly mark you for they lost heavily and had to fight for every inch of the

1454
02:34:20.88 --> 02:34:28.80
bloody ground they got there with things getting hotter still I was moved again to what was thought to be

1455
02:34:28.80 --> 02:34:35.36
a safer spot just to the other side and along the landing area suddenly there was an all mighty

1456
02:34:35.36 --> 02:34:41.04
explosion in the room on my right men were already wounded once twice were hit again in somewhere killed

1457
02:34:42.88 --> 02:34:48.24
there were pittiest cries coming from that room it was at this time that major John Wadi

1458
02:34:48.24 --> 02:34:54.48
of the 156 parachute battalion who had started his parachute days in India when the battalion was

1459
02:34:54.48 --> 02:35:00.16
first formed was wounded again and two English medics and a Dutch nurse were killed a medic now

1460
02:35:00.16 --> 02:35:05.84
came out cradling a form in his arms the chapy carried could have been dead or unconscious

1461
02:35:06.56 --> 02:35:11.76
he was covered in blood and his arm was shattered and hung prophetically by his side his left leg

1462
02:35:11.76 --> 02:35:24.72
bandaged from his first wounding Christ I wish I were outside there was another resounding crash

1463
02:35:24.72 --> 02:35:30.56
of bombs followed by curses perhaps I was better off in here it was bloody awful for everyone

1464
02:35:30.56 --> 02:35:37.84
everywhere outside the situation was getting completely out of hand further enemy reinforcements

1465
02:35:37.84 --> 02:35:43.04
were mustering around the perimeter in the form of powerfully armed tanks from the SS Panzer

1466
02:35:43.04 --> 02:35:46.80
divisions with long barreled high explosives and armor piercing shells

1467
02:35:48.64 --> 02:35:53.44
the passage where I lay ran from front to rear the hotel and I was facing the rear with a

1468
02:35:53.44 --> 02:35:57.84
grandstand view of the battle through a gaping hole in the wall where once there had been a window

1469
02:35:58.80 --> 02:36:03.76
now and again one of our men would break cover to stock the enemy and the enemy would repeat

1470
02:36:03.76 --> 02:36:10.56
the process with the multiple accompaniment of shell burst tank fire machine gun fire curses and

1471
02:36:10.56 --> 02:36:18.24
yelps of pain I heard the ominous sound of an approaching tank I couldn't see it but the

1472
02:36:18.24 --> 02:36:24.40
squeaking of its caterpillar wheels grew even louder then it came into view it's great gun

1473
02:36:24.40 --> 02:36:31.20
traversing from right to left picking its way through the trees it stopped for a few minutes to

1474
02:36:31.20 --> 02:36:38.000
feel its way and then the gun barked out sending a shell across my front to an unseen target

1475
02:36:39.36 --> 02:36:43.20
the other wounded were lying huddled together trying to afford each other protection

1476
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.36
the floor was littered with debris blood and glass and there was an incest and wind and explosion

1477
02:36:49.36 --> 02:36:54.32
of mortar bombs together with the shrieking crash of artillery vibrating the very foundations of the

1478
02:36:54.32 --> 02:37:00.72
building which I thought when it's some point tumbled down I don't know what time it was when the

1479
02:37:00.72 --> 02:37:06.88
shelling and gun fire stopped but after a den of the last six days it felt very strange to suddenly

1480
02:37:07.84 --> 02:37:14.000
be so much quieter there were still spasmotic firing in the distance and a little shelling

1481
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:21.04
but nothing to worry about we began to converse more freely gone on strike Jerry one man almost

1482
02:37:21.04 --> 02:37:28.08
shouted except that his head half his mouth bandaged from a shell splinter wound nah he's packed

1483
02:37:28.08 --> 02:37:34.80
up as Jerry and buggered off a cockney put in the glider pilot was more cautious crafty saw

1484
02:37:34.80 --> 02:37:41.28
is the hunt he's got something up his sleeve then I saw men being carried downstairs with great

1485
02:37:41.28 --> 02:37:49.12
activity going on outside but not of battle two medics picked me up both of them silent and not

1486
02:37:49.12 --> 02:37:56.64
looking to please where to now I asked the Elizabeth hospital one told me the enemy had overrun us

1487
02:37:56.64 --> 02:38:12.32
and was calling the shots so the Germans were now in control he gets taken out south outside

1488
02:38:12.32 --> 02:38:18.80
was a ghastly site with the fallen dead of both our sides lying where they had gone down

1489
02:38:19.84 --> 02:38:24.72
British and German medical orderlies were putting the wounded into jeeps and various other vehicles

1490
02:38:24.72 --> 02:38:30.16
including two small vans improvised as makeshift ambulances three of us stretcher cases were

1491
02:38:30.16 --> 02:38:35.60
loaded into a small open German lorry with shallow sides which would prevent us from bouncing off

1492
02:38:35.60 --> 02:38:45.52
and transit there was just enough room for five walking wounded now they're on this drive we all

1493
02:38:45.52 --> 02:38:50.32
had shattered bones of some sort which made us cry out and pain during the rough ride in this

1494
02:38:50.32 --> 02:38:56.40
antico anticoated lorry and I was still more than pleased when it finally came to a stand still

1495
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:01.60
at journeys end at the hospital there had clearly been heavy fighting and as spent cartridges could

1496
02:39:01.60 --> 02:39:08.24
see be seen littering the floor and entranceway I heard that familiar voice of a friend what the

1497
02:39:08.24 --> 02:39:14.80
hell are you doing on that stretcher scrounging for a lift I went to answer but nothing came out

1498
02:39:14.80 --> 02:39:23.28
can you imagine you go to the hospital and the floor has got bullets chasing all over it

1499
02:39:25.68 --> 02:39:30.32
word got around that the whole show was over and I began to wonder what really went wrong

1500
02:39:30.88 --> 02:39:36.48
the battle had been lost but it had been some fight as mortar sergeant Dick winning him later

1501
02:39:36.48 --> 02:39:44.64
Riley remarked we may have lost the battle at our nm but we did come in second it should be noted

1502
02:39:44.64 --> 02:39:49.52
that there had not only been a great loss of life in this battle but also massive local

1503
02:39:49.52 --> 02:39:58.000
destruction with one or one in four houses totally destroyed in most of the remainder badly damaged

1504
02:40:02.40 --> 02:40:08.88
and so again you know I talked about the scene the different sides of the Germans and you know

1505
02:40:08.88 --> 02:40:14.40
we already saw some of the Germans the prisoners being second by what the kind of civilian

1506
02:40:14.40 --> 02:40:19.92
casualties were taking places they evacuated done Kirk the the Germans that were firing inside

1507
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:24.24
the hospital and then when they get told by an unarmed you know leader hey get out of here there's

1508
02:40:24.24 --> 02:40:32.40
okay fine they're grumpy but they leave just the fact that these the patients are the wounded are

1509
02:40:32.40 --> 02:40:39.76
getting treated actually pretty well so they end up in this sort of makeshift hospital

1510
02:40:41.44 --> 02:40:47.12
South African orthopedic surgeon captain Alexander Lippman castle was going to see me

1511
02:40:47.12 --> 02:40:51.92
he commanded one of the surgical teams of the 16 pair of field ambulance I was thankful that I was

1512
02:40:51.92 --> 02:40:57.28
not going to have a German butcher I had seen the end result of a German doctor's amputation of a

1513
02:40:57.28 --> 02:41:02.88
man's foot crudely almost guillotine and without anesthetic I was carried into a large room with

1514
02:41:02.88 --> 02:41:07.20
medical apparatus everywhere trowlies and tables laden with all sorts of instruments bandages field

1515
02:41:07.20 --> 02:41:12.96
dressing in splints I was placed on a hard narrow table about four feet from the ground in the distance

1516
02:41:12.96 --> 02:41:18.40
I could hear the sound of gunfire and German flock which meant that our aircraft were in the vicinity

1517
02:41:19.28 --> 02:41:24.48
the anesthesiists put up had his needle at the ready and medics were preparing for the operation

1518
02:41:24.48 --> 02:41:29.92
when there was a noise rather like a giant balloon having air released and then a terrific explosion

1519
02:41:31.12 --> 02:41:35.68
with a very quick presence of mind one medic threw a blanket over me and shielded me from the

1520
02:41:35.68 --> 02:41:42.64
blast with his own body as shattered glass fell in small pieces and slivers all over the operating theater

1521
02:41:43.92 --> 02:41:49.60
then all went quiet again and the blanket was pulled carefully to reveal yours truly with popping

1522
02:41:49.60 --> 02:41:52.80
eyes my treatment had to wait another day while the place was cleaned up

1523
02:41:52.80 --> 02:41:57.60
fortunately for me the next visit was uninterrupted the wound was cleaned and redressed

1524
02:41:58.24 --> 02:42:05.60
and I had my first plaster cast put on and so like I said it seems like at this point it's

1525
02:42:05.60 --> 02:42:12.48
it's relatively civilized I mean if you can forgive a bomb exploding while you're about to get surgery

1526
02:42:12.48 --> 02:42:18.88
but relatively civilized compared to what they'd been through at one point there's an SS officer

1527
02:42:18.88 --> 02:42:24.64
comes in and they kind of go through the different individuals there and they finally get to him

1528
02:42:24.64 --> 02:42:29.76
and when he tells him he's an airborne guy they say you're going to prison a work app

1529
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:36.000
and he says here was September 28th there was a 28th of September when German orderly

1530
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000
he's carried me out of the hospital not so carefully as our own medics and I had to hang on

1531
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.72
to the sides of the stretchers we descended the stone steps at the entrance to avoid sliding off

1532
02:42:44.72 --> 02:42:54.96
and now he gets transported again this time he ends up at the Villem 3 concern barracks

1533
02:42:58.72 --> 02:43:05.92
we were given iron beds with straw filled pillows and the floors were dirty there was no

1534
02:43:05.92 --> 02:43:12.64
heating and only a meager supply of medical necessities and then at one point a doctor or or

1535
02:43:12.64 --> 02:43:21.68
I presume he was entered the room accompanied by a rotten fear of the SS medical corps the stench

1536
02:43:21.68 --> 02:43:27.12
from my wound caused disapproval on the face of the doctor and grabbing my big toe with his finger

1537
02:43:27.12 --> 02:43:32.16
he slowly raised the leg which began to bend at the wound beneath the knee were both the

1538
02:43:32.16 --> 02:43:37.04
Tibia and Fibia were broken stopping he peered at the wound inquisitively

1539
02:43:37.04 --> 02:43:42.72
D-Mind that hurts I told him where upon he simply released the hold of my leg and let it fall in the

1540
02:43:42.72 --> 02:43:49.68
hard table instantly turning to go looking at me in the eyes with his statistic expression as he did so

1541
02:43:51.04 --> 02:43:58.000
you bastard square headed shite hawk I said I couldn't care less if he didn't understand the phrase

1542
02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:03.12
he just raised an eyebrow with an inquiring looking departed while I returned to my private world of pain

1543
02:44:03.12 --> 02:44:11.20
then the medics came back with that infernal SS guard and redress and repostured my leg

1544
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:19.20
so like I said there's I mean it's not great treatment but I mean let's face it he's alive

1545
02:44:20.24 --> 02:44:24.32
and he goes on here I was at the barracks for a little more than a week

1546
02:44:24.88 --> 02:44:31.44
when one morning I was prepared for yet another move this time a short journey to the juliana hospital in

1547
02:44:31.44 --> 02:44:39.92
apple doom apple dorn my stay at juliana hospital is going to be the longest and best as far as

1548
02:44:39.92 --> 02:44:44.56
medical care goes go the hospital staff with Dutch doctors and nurses helped by our own doctors

1549
02:44:44.56 --> 02:44:48.64
and orderlies and the Germans left us well alone to fend for our own medical requirements

1550
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:58.08
like I said that seems fairly civilized to me and they're trying to help him out and here we go

1551
02:44:58.08 --> 02:45:03.44
it was decided to apply a gadget called a Kirchner wire extension to my leg as both bones were broken

1552
02:45:03.44 --> 02:45:08.96
below the knee the theory was to stretch the leg and try to marry the bones in the correct position

1553
02:45:08.96 --> 02:45:14.56
under an injection of evapand a steel bar was shot through my ankle bone to act as an anchor

1554
02:45:15.12 --> 02:45:20.96
a steel cable was then attached to the anchor and to a pulley apparatus below the foot of the bed

1555
02:45:20.96 --> 02:45:26.32
weights were added each day to steadily stretch the leg otherwise I was told I would be left with a

1556
02:45:26.32 --> 02:45:32.000
two inch shortening necessitating the use of a club boot at a later date which I didn't much

1557
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:37.60
care for but my general condition my general and local condition had regressed considerably

1558
02:45:38.24 --> 02:45:47.52
and I was at my lowest ab I was now wishing that I could see the end of this confounded uses

1559
02:45:47.52 --> 02:45:55.44
lump of decaying flesh and bone on the 19th of November I got my reluctant wish and my leg was

1560
02:45:55.44 --> 02:46:03.28
amputated by major Peter Smith of the 133rd parachute field ambulance as I later learned it was

1561
02:46:03.28 --> 02:46:09.84
not a moment too soon prior to the operation I had been regarded as a hopeless case one of those

1562
02:46:09.84 --> 02:46:17.04
certain of not lasting after surgery however I made such an amazingly quick recovery that I was

1563
02:46:17.04 --> 02:46:23.28
back to life and sitting out of bed only a week later the medical orderlies could not do enough for us

1564
02:46:23.28 --> 02:46:29.28
from baste of fetching bed pants carrying patients from the bed to the loo and back again soothing

1565
02:46:29.28 --> 02:46:34.32
and dying soothing the dying or reading a book for those two weeks are exhausted to do so for

1566
02:46:34.32 --> 02:46:40.16
themselves they were always on call all hours of the day and night I wondered when they managed

1567
02:46:40.16 --> 02:46:46.000
to eat or sleep I asked one who was passing with a bottle in his hand he answered quite cheerfully

1568
02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:55.36
oh we get forty winks now and then with snack in between so there you go I mean almost one sentence

1569
02:46:56.80 --> 02:47:05.68
no two sentences he was wishing that he could get this decaying hunk of flesh off of his body

1570
02:47:05.68 --> 02:47:10.48
and the next time the next sentence is got reacted that's that's that's how much

1571
02:47:10.48 --> 02:47:20.16
that's that's that's that's that's been as matter of fact as you can get I guess is what I'm going with this

1572
02:47:27.68 --> 02:47:33.04
this is a one last little section of this a Polish parah who had dropped at Arknem

1573
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:38.56
was opposite me in the corner of the world he'd been caught up badly and was having a rough time

1574
02:47:38.56 --> 02:47:43.28
a German military clergyman kept calling to say prayers and finally came to administer the last

1575
02:47:43.28 --> 02:47:50.56
rights as he stood there in his dark olive green uniform black jack boots and belt

1576
02:47:50.56 --> 02:47:56.64
peaked cap under his arm I scrutinized his close cropped bull neck and square jaw I could not

1577
02:47:56.64 --> 02:48:03.28
help a notice and thought how strange that he wore a gunholster a man of the cloth with a pistol

1578
02:48:03.28 --> 02:48:16.08
in a hospital what next so he talks about you know the care that he gets he starts getting moved

1579
02:48:16.08 --> 02:48:19.76
around a lot the Germans kept shipping us out as soon as they thought we were fit enough to travel

1580
02:48:19.76 --> 02:48:25.04
and once again I found myself in a truck this time heading to the rail station at Apple Dorn

1581
02:48:25.04 --> 02:48:32.000
where we pulled up alongside of and boarded red cross train and of course this stuff just never

1582
02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:38.32
gets easy daylight came with a German doing is nut and shouting spit fire actone spit fire actone

1583
02:48:39.04 --> 02:48:43.20
I watched a lone spit fire turn and fly parallel to the train at about a hundred feet with the same

1584
02:48:43.20 --> 02:48:49.04
distance from the train it was quite cheeky I thought the pilot was having a real close look to

1585
02:48:49.04 --> 02:48:53.44
make sure it was a hospital train I could see clearly as goggles were off in white scarf

1586
02:48:53.44 --> 02:48:59.04
and felt like giving him a wave as he disappeared behind some pine trees we were now in Germany with

1587
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:04.80
snow-covered mountains and forests of fur log cabins dotted here and there making it also pitch

1588
02:49:04.80 --> 02:49:11.76
a risk as nightfall came we halted at a dismal looking place a small town I think unfortunately

1589
02:49:11.76 --> 02:49:18.64
the luxury was now over and we were ushered off the train in a collection on a collection of

1590
02:49:18.64 --> 02:49:26.64
crutches of varying lengths that were produced and given to the leg amputees so they get end up in this

1591
02:49:26.64 --> 02:49:33.68
like just junk place we were all a bit under the weather with the added unpleasantness of an

1592
02:49:33.68 --> 02:49:41.36
amputation one lathe and arm and a hand missing another two arms off and most like myself had lost

1593
02:49:41.36 --> 02:49:47.36
the leg one poor fellow was the worst for blisters on his one and only foot we had a wounded medic

1594
02:49:47.36 --> 02:49:53.28
who was with us and did all he could to help with medical minimal medical supplies we had only paper

1595
02:49:53.28 --> 02:49:58.48
bandages it was not the best of nights on the cold stone floor but I somehow slept others were

1596
02:49:58.48 --> 02:50:03.12
not so first fortunate and one chap did not even live to see the rest of the journey remaining

1597
02:50:03.12 --> 02:50:11.68
motionless the next morning as we were roused by the guards so this transport continues gets on a

1598
02:50:11.68 --> 02:50:19.60
train finally ends up at another place the snow is quite thick we pulled in what looked like a

1599
02:50:19.60 --> 02:50:24.80
school in a small town near Munster three of the yanks of myself were told to get out and then

1600
02:50:24.80 --> 02:50:31.12
a lorry carried on its way leaving a standing in the crisp snow a voice called welcome buddy come in

1601
02:50:31.76 --> 02:50:38.96
he's a big American from Indiana called Marvin Adams inside he showed us to a room on the left

1602
02:50:38.96 --> 02:50:46.96
grab yourself a pillow and bed down here I'll do yours bud he said looking me up and down

1603
02:50:46.96 --> 02:50:52.000
how'd your manage that fella put the best foot forward at the wrong time I answered

1604
02:50:52.72 --> 02:50:57.92
oh well the St. the Ritz but will have fun he said I wonder what he meant by that

1605
02:50:58.80 --> 02:51:03.68
always good to be that person with a good attitude we even when you're an adam prisoner of war camp

1606
02:51:07.92 --> 02:51:11.12
going on here the Germans guards were not existing except at night

1607
02:51:12.32 --> 02:51:16.24
as we were all severely wounded there was thick snow outside they were obviously not worried about

1608
02:51:16.24 --> 02:51:27.76
a massive scape food was sparse but regular and then again more moving I was just getting used to this

1609
02:51:27.76 --> 02:51:32.24
place when word went round that Jerry was moving us some of us maybe for repatriation

1610
02:51:33.12 --> 02:51:38.88
having only one pin meaning leg I thought I stood a good chance to be in on this then early one

1611
02:51:38.88 --> 02:51:44.000
morning three yanks two Russians in myself were ushered to a truck and taken on a passenger train

1612
02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:48.80
in which we travel the few miles only to detrain again perhaps to get another connection

1613
02:51:48.80 --> 02:51:54.72
for as our yet for our as yet to be undisclosed location destination

1614
02:51:56.64 --> 02:52:02.32
and then they get off that train they get on another train they get on this other train

1615
02:52:02.32 --> 02:52:08.48
after shunting around a bit and hitching up to another train we rolled off again it was dusk

1616
02:52:08.48 --> 02:52:15.28
cold and pretty dimo all told then someone struck up our version of the song bless him all

1617
02:52:18.32 --> 02:52:24.72
and their version of the song was salt them all salt them all belong in the short and the tall

1618
02:52:24.72 --> 02:52:31.20
salt all the sergeants and the W.O. ones salt all the corpus and their bastard sons

1619
02:52:31.20 --> 02:52:37.12
for we're saying goodbye to them all as back to their billets they crawl you'll get no promotion

1620
02:52:37.12 --> 02:52:46.88
aside of the ocean so cheer up me lads saw them all and he says it seemed we had joined a group of

1621
02:52:46.88 --> 02:52:58.08
British soldiers by this was by way of an introduction they finally make it to bremen

1622
02:52:58.56 --> 02:53:02.64
we pulled in slowly and as the train came to a stop there were sounds of doors opening in the

1623
02:53:02.64 --> 02:53:06.80
hustle and bustle of people getting off and making their way along the platform and then it happened

1624
02:53:06.80 --> 02:53:11.84
an air raid warning wind out civilian military personnel immediately began scurrying about in the

1625
02:53:11.84 --> 02:53:17.36
military I noticed did not hesitate to shove anyone else out of their way a little shot at the

1626
02:53:17.36 --> 02:53:21.28
German military the civilians are getting pushed out of the way so they can get to cover

1627
02:53:23.12 --> 02:53:28.72
the air was humming with aircraft american Boeing b-17 flying fortresses and our guards

1628
02:53:28.72 --> 02:53:32.72
quick in their step way ahead of us periodically turning to beckon us to hurry it up

1629
02:53:32.72 --> 02:53:37.76
we entered the shelter being enough for about a hundred people and after a lot of pushing and

1630
02:53:37.76 --> 02:53:42.88
shoving settled among amid the gliers and remarks thrown our way I was happy to let it happen

1631
02:53:42.88 --> 02:53:47.76
but somehow I'd been pushed and guided into a corner of the shelter away from the door if a bomb

1632
02:53:47.76 --> 02:53:53.36
lands two near the the Germans take it blast take the blast and cushion any effect on us I thought

1633
02:53:54.08 --> 02:53:59.76
there was a wooden batch fixed to the wall I dropped to it exhausted three guards it spread out between us

1634
02:53:59.76 --> 02:54:05.44
and other occupants and when the bombing started in earnest the shelter shook I was sure

1635
02:54:05.44 --> 02:54:10.08
wanted landed close outside because I felt it's draft reminding me of being blown off my feet

1636
02:54:10.08 --> 02:54:15.92
in North Africa only that time it was just 50 feet away everyone fell silent as the drone of

1637
02:54:15.92 --> 02:54:22.000
aircraft and wind and crash a bombs went on with ever increasing ferocity for a good hour before

1638
02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:28.72
dying down to a steady drumming and an occasional distant explosion I must admit I always think of

1639
02:54:28.72 --> 02:54:38.56
these bombing runs as taking like maybe 10 minutes but we're talking about a good hour

1640
02:54:40.48 --> 02:54:45.12
people began to chatter this is once everything's kind of faded people began to chatter

1641
02:54:45.12 --> 02:54:50.64
as interfered dispersed and external barvato took over I could hear the gnashing of teeth

1642
02:54:51.92 --> 02:54:56.24
glances accompanying finger pointing in our direction the crowd is getting rest if in a big

1643
02:54:56.24 --> 02:55:03.92
man started pouring forth with words of abuse a big frow about 40 years old worked her way near

1644
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:08.72
to us until she was only a couple feet away I felt the murt moisture of her spiddlesty argued with

1645
02:55:08.72 --> 02:55:13.28
the guards about the privilege we had being allowed to be in the same shelter as the German people

1646
02:55:13.84 --> 02:55:18.40
I gathered that was a crux of the matter that was the crux of the matter at this point a heavy

1647
02:55:18.40 --> 02:55:24.24
booted foot came out and started propelling my way I parried firmly with my right hand and the boot

1648
02:55:24.24 --> 02:55:30.56
just brushed my balls coming to a harmless glancing blow on my left thigh the guards stood firm

1649
02:55:30.56 --> 02:55:34.56
restraining the woman and trying to calm everyone down it was only then that I noticed

1650
02:55:36.96 --> 02:55:44.48
a familiar sound in French our guards were Frenchmen constricted in the German army

1651
02:55:44.48 --> 02:55:51.12
anyway they saved my nuts from being cracked there must have been another hours wait at the

1652
02:55:51.12 --> 02:55:56.80
station another back going to transfer again there must have been another hours waited the station until

1653
02:55:56.80 --> 02:56:03.92
I an old army type lorry with solid tires turned up or sorry they were waiting for truck

1654
02:56:03.92 --> 02:56:07.84
I couldn't care less at this stage provided I didn't have to hobble on crutches before long

1655
02:56:07.84 --> 02:56:12.80
I saw the large POW camp ahead with its eight foot high wire fences and guards platform

1656
02:56:12.80 --> 02:56:18.48
sticking up like store thumbs all around there was a collection of dingy looking huts dotting the interior

1657
02:56:18.48 --> 02:56:25.52
the lorry slowed at the gate and the senior guard jumped down through the hand to go through the

1658
02:56:25.52 --> 02:56:31.92
handing over ceremony then the big wood and wire gates creed open and the lorry jerked into the

1659
02:56:31.92 --> 02:56:39.04
compound where out we tumbled I was exhausted and sweating as if I just come out of a Turkish bath

1660
02:56:39.04 --> 02:56:44.24
my stump was throbbing I stayed lying on the ground where I landed managing to support myself on

1661
02:56:44.24 --> 02:56:50.96
one elbow while the rest of the party sat knelt or remained standing with the aid of their crutches

1662
02:56:51.84 --> 02:56:55.52
I didn't want a welcoming committee but wished that someone would show us where to go

1663
02:56:55.52 --> 02:57:00.16
one of the guards was busy having a chat and laughed with his mate eventually he gave us the go ahead

1664
02:57:00.16 --> 02:57:04.96
and the party moved off slowly and weirdly I found myself left behind I tried to get up but I could

1665
02:57:04.96 --> 02:57:08.72
not muster enough strength to make it so I started crawling dragging the crutches

1666
02:57:08.72 --> 02:57:14.16
I'd only manage five or six yards when I heard voices and saw two pairs of gated boots come

1667
02:57:14.80 --> 02:57:21.04
come on me old mate a voice said we'll give you a lift on which they lifted me with ease and

1668
02:57:21.04 --> 02:57:25.76
carried me I don't know how far I didn't even get a glimpse of their faces to say thanks

1669
02:57:28.88 --> 02:57:34.56
sinking down onto a straw mattress I just slept and slept for the next two days when I woke

1670
02:57:34.56 --> 02:57:42.16
I found that I was in Stolog X1B in Saxony along with a large number of other airborne men

1671
02:57:42.16 --> 02:57:48.80
it was not long before I contracted more complaints to add to my already sorry condition

1672
02:57:48.80 --> 02:57:54.80
Lysen bugs were in abundance in my hut the nights were the worst the iron stove was stoked right

1673
02:57:54.80 --> 02:57:59.36
up at night and the heat was awful with all the doors and windows shut tight urine buckets

1674
02:57:59.36 --> 02:58:04.16
would fill to the brim and no time making the stench nauseous I went down with dysentery

1675
02:58:04.16 --> 02:58:10.24
plurzy and scarlet fever which together with my amputation meant that I did not feel all that good

1676
02:58:13.84 --> 02:58:23.60
red is hard as nails if I had wanted to die I would have but fortunately that didn't enter my head

1677
02:58:24.96 --> 02:58:31.36
little key note as I read that I thought hmm let's think about that

1678
02:58:31.36 --> 02:58:38.64
if you want to die if you want to give up you there's the time but luckily fortunately for him

1679
02:58:38.64 --> 02:58:42.64
that thought did not enter his head after a short time promising news

1680
02:58:43.60 --> 02:58:48.64
again I'm jumping ahead like this is what we're talking every little thing that he just talked

1681
02:58:48.64 --> 02:58:55.60
about is a nightmare and he's got him all at the same time it's been a while since we talked about

1682
02:58:55.60 --> 02:59:03.28
lice on the podcast yeah we've been missing out on that one we think lice is no big deal

1683
02:59:03.28 --> 02:59:07.04
because your kid gets it and then you get some special little medicine from the store and then you put

1684
02:59:07.04 --> 02:59:14.16
it in their hair or you shave their head and and either way prom solved these guys are got it

1685
02:59:15.20 --> 02:59:23.84
and there's no way to get rid of it this is by the way wall that got dysentery and plurzy

1686
02:59:23.84 --> 02:59:33.04
and scarlet fever and an amputation however fast forward a little bit after a short time promising

1687
02:59:33.04 --> 02:59:37.52
news I was told that I was going to be repatriated I boarded yet another train no sooner than we

1688
02:59:37.52 --> 02:59:41.52
set off that there was a terrific woosh in the train stopped in the middle nowhere I could hear the

1689
02:59:41.52 --> 02:59:46.48
gutteral tang twang of German civilians as they ran hell for leather on each side of the train

1690
02:59:46.48 --> 02:59:50.32
to take cover from what must have been our own aircraft overhead one of the guards just

1691
02:59:50.32 --> 02:59:54.88
the moose and left it to us looking down to the track I saw that it was much too high for me to jump

1692
02:59:54.88 --> 03:00:02.48
with only one leg the some of our party of eight jumped and took cover I found my pants and don't

1693
03:00:02.48 --> 03:00:08.96
know whether it was fright or the dysentery that was still with me the planes returned they were

1694
03:00:08.96 --> 03:00:14.96
to rocket firing RAF typhoons which specialized in ground attack I recognized the sound as they

1695
03:00:14.96 --> 03:00:19.60
got nearer there was another woosh and then another followed by an ear splitting explosion

1696
03:00:19.60 --> 03:00:24.32
the carriage shook so violently that I thought we were going to topple over as always in such a

1697
03:00:24.32 --> 03:00:30.24
task it was over in no time with such a tax it was over in no time and all of a suddenly peaceful again

1698
03:00:33.44 --> 03:00:37.92
so they have to go and repair this train and then finally we had reached a snug little village

1699
03:00:37.92 --> 03:00:46.56
called Myzberg on the German side of the border with Belgium and once again we see some nicer

1700
03:00:46.56 --> 03:00:50.80
treatment our first job was to be cleaned up and we were taken in pairs into the shower I was

1701
03:00:50.80 --> 03:00:54.40
asked to remove all personal items from my pockets and all clothing was to be cleaned and few

1702
03:00:54.40 --> 03:00:59.20
amigated don't worry you'll get everything back and English medic told me here put this on it was

1703
03:00:59.20 --> 03:01:03.92
a sort of cotton smock which tied in the back was just long enough to cover to the knee first in

1704
03:01:03.92 --> 03:01:10.000
came a great big American with the same garb with forms like tree branches he lifted me bodily with

1705
03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:18.08
the ease of samps and himself mind you I was down from 14 stone to just over eight since last

1706
03:01:18.08 --> 03:01:26.56
September and to translate that into American English he weighed 196 pounds in September and now

1707
03:01:26.56 --> 03:01:36.96
he weighs 112 on reaching the shower is made ask can you stand on one leg bud sure I said

1708
03:01:36.96 --> 03:01:42.16
samps and it taken his smock off and proceeded to bathe me while herkilly steadyed me I was carried

1709
03:01:42.16 --> 03:01:48.72
back to a most luxurious bed with white sheets God knows where the when they scrounge the sheets

1710
03:01:48.72 --> 03:01:53.44
but trust the yanks there were approximately 40 wounded there a mixture of English French and

1711
03:01:53.44 --> 03:01:59.28
American with four American and two English orderlies one of the walking wounded act that is a

1712
03:01:59.28 --> 03:02:05.84
cook all the others doing menial tasks they did not mind though so he's in this pretty

1713
03:02:07.52 --> 03:02:14.80
car can I even say let's say let's just say and improved situation and improved situation is what is

1714
03:02:14.80 --> 03:02:24.08
he and that goes on a little bit or even he calls it the luxury things began to live in

1715
03:02:24.08 --> 03:02:31.04
up outside the rumbling in the distance grunier and groups of bejragled weary looking Germans

1716
03:02:31.04 --> 03:02:37.60
plotted through the village the wounded born by horse and cart field guns were manhandled

1717
03:02:37.60 --> 03:02:42.88
the luxury of any motorized transport being afforded to senior officers only who clearly

1718
03:02:42.88 --> 03:02:50.32
wished to withdraw in his dignified manner as possible leaving hunter officers to do all the

1719
03:02:50.32 --> 03:02:56.16
donkey work along with the shoots and and suffer all the humiliation of being seen by their own

1720
03:02:56.16 --> 03:03:03.68
countrymen it was a pathetic sight like a cutting from the first world war film archives as the

1721
03:03:03.68 --> 03:03:11.20
dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and tanks was very near so he's seeing the Germans

1722
03:03:11.20 --> 03:03:16.16
kind of walking back he's seeing the officers in the vehicles the German officers in the vehicles

1723
03:03:16.16 --> 03:03:26.56
and the German troops walking or being carried if they were wounded and years tank activity right

1724
03:03:26.56 --> 03:03:30.16
which is kind of an indication where you have tank activity but you see people withdrawing with horses

1725
03:03:30.16 --> 03:03:34.56
and garages that's an indication that perhaps the tanks that we're hearing are good friendly

1726
03:03:37.28 --> 03:03:41.12
as dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and the tanks was very near

1727
03:03:41.12 --> 03:03:45.68
you could hear the squeak of the tanks wheels rubbing against the caterpillar track

1728
03:03:45.68 --> 03:03:51.44
thirsty for lubrication edging and shunting into position for the impending advance in the village

1729
03:03:53.84 --> 03:04:00.000
that noise that a tank makes in the city is just wind well who is the awesome

1730
03:04:01.12 --> 03:04:06.16
and and it's also horrifying like these guys when they're hearing the German tanks outside when they're

1731
03:04:06.16 --> 03:04:13.20
in that that battle whether about to be overrun the horror can't even imagine of tanks coming

1732
03:04:13.20 --> 03:04:18.48
and now the joy which I got to experience some of the joy in the body of hey the tanks are coming

1733
03:04:18.48 --> 03:04:25.52
it's glorious and god bless the tankers and here these guys feel in the same way the American

1734
03:04:25.52 --> 03:04:32.72
orderlies were jubilant they're here lie me the yanks are here exploded Hank anyone who get up walk hop

1735
03:04:32.72 --> 03:04:37.76
or propel themselves in some way momentarily forgot their wounds in discomfort they peered

1736
03:04:37.76 --> 03:04:41.60
through the cracks and the doors through the windows I could not see anything from my window

1737
03:04:41.60 --> 03:04:46.16
only the Nazi flag of the local garrison hanging listless like the enemy itself

1738
03:04:46.96 --> 03:04:51.36
bill one of the english medics came gashing and not knowing which way to turn in his excitement

1739
03:04:51.36 --> 03:04:55.60
there's hundreds of them there's hundreds of tanks out there bloody well hundreds of them

1740
03:04:55.60 --> 03:05:03.12
Sherman tanks of general patterns armored division had encircled the village in the early hours

1741
03:05:03.12 --> 03:05:08.88
of that morning and were in a very advantageous position as we were in the valley and they were on the

1742
03:05:08.88 --> 03:05:17.68
high ground every gun would have its own selected target with orders to open fire if fired upon

1743
03:05:17.68 --> 03:05:23.20
thankfully the tanks played a waiting game with the non-existent enemy because the because unknown

1744
03:05:23.20 --> 03:05:30.48
to the Americans the birds had flown an American scout car ventured cautiously toward

1745
03:05:30.48 --> 03:05:36.000
the village on molested it reached the outskirts scanning the bridge buildings where white flags were

1746
03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:43.04
protruding no sign of the enemy still in view of the tanks on the hill it became bolder and

1747
03:05:43.04 --> 03:05:49.76
crews gently into the village our makeshift hospital with a painted red cross on the roof

1748
03:05:49.76 --> 03:05:56.32
must have been in view of the scout car now all these goings on were being shouted by one of the

1749
03:05:56.32 --> 03:06:00.96
medics in the passageway for the benefit of all those like me who could not see for themselves so he's

1750
03:06:00.96 --> 03:06:08.24
getting a play by play the scout car came to a stop it's occupants clutching their automatic

1751
03:06:08.24 --> 03:06:15.44
at the ready they must have spotted someone step carefully into view that person was a medic

1752
03:06:15.44 --> 03:06:21.12
with a red cross arm band Hank the orderly from Ohio he was about a hundred yards from the

1753
03:06:21.12 --> 03:06:26.72
scout car and they stealthily approached each other Hank not wishing to be mistaken for a German

1754
03:06:26.72 --> 03:06:36.88
ruse though in the scout car not wishing to fall for any trick as they drew closer the realization

1755
03:06:36.88 --> 03:06:43.52
dawned that they were brothers a wireless call was immediately sent to the tanks on the skyline

1756
03:06:43.52 --> 03:06:50.48
and in minutes the village was alive to their rumble as they thundered on through leaving an

1757
03:06:50.48 --> 03:06:58.48
accurate smell of oil and exhaust fumes I was almost home

1758
03:07:04.48 --> 03:07:08.48
and you know I got to that point in the book and I was like well that's that's where you stop

1759
03:07:08.48 --> 03:07:18.40
and it's definitely a good place to stop but let's take that as a stop

1760
03:07:20.96 --> 03:07:29.20
that incredible glory of seeing the Americans seeing patents armored division rolling

1761
03:07:31.28 --> 03:07:33.12
and knowing that he was almost home

1762
03:07:33.12 --> 03:07:42.24
but there are some things to think about and he covers them in the epilogue here he says the

1763
03:07:42.24 --> 03:07:49.04
casualties in the arnum area alone were eight thousand airborne killed the wounded captured

1764
03:07:49.04 --> 03:07:57.68
or missing including poles plus more than four hundred RAF pilots in crew

1765
03:07:57.68 --> 03:08:06.24
there were 750 Dutch civilians and underground fighters killed at least two thousand five hundred

1766
03:08:06.24 --> 03:08:15.52
Germans and in the following winter of 1944 to 1945 some 200 thousand Dutch died of starvation

1767
03:08:16.80 --> 03:08:24.000
so it's so it's important to understand that these you see you see this through one man's eyes

1768
03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:32.24
but that thousands in fact hundreds of thousands were affected by this particular battle

1769
03:08:36.32 --> 03:08:40.72
and again that might be a good place to stop but there's another note here he talks about

1770
03:08:40.72 --> 03:08:47.84
several years later I visited the place of thinking if you will of that great man and founder of

1771
03:08:47.84 --> 03:08:56.64
the parachute regimen Winston Churchill the war rooms situated far below ground at the

1772
03:08:56.64 --> 03:09:04.000
treasury chambers in Westminster the existence of these a war in room war in of rooms was a well kept

1773
03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:09.44
secret during the warriors the tour was fascinating everything remained exactly as it had been back

1774
03:09:09.44 --> 03:09:15.04
then I sat in Churchill's chair in front of me on the desk printed on a black card

1775
03:09:15.04 --> 03:09:23.76
printed in black on a card the words of Queen Victoria in this house we never speak of defeat

1776
03:09:31.04 --> 03:09:37.28
in this house we never speak of defeat and he goes on in the toilet there was a red telephone

1777
03:09:37.28 --> 03:09:44.64
a direct line to President Roosevelt in Washington in the visiting ministers room I opened a

1778
03:09:44.64 --> 03:09:52.000
book entitled World War II on the Sicily landings and saw a training shot of members of my 11th

1779
03:09:52.000 --> 03:10:02.32
S.A.S. Battalion to the four in the lineup were Harry Bance Corporal Hudson Jimmy Metcalf

1780
03:10:03.92 --> 03:10:04.56
and myself

1781
03:10:04.56 --> 03:10:18.64
down here beneath Westminster I surrounded I am sure by a dedicated team Churchill did his job

1782
03:10:18.64 --> 03:10:26.48
extremely well I would like to think that I did my best alongside other leopards,

1783
03:10:26.48 --> 03:10:44.88
lions and tigers of the first parachute brigade and again I really didn't get into the fact that

1784
03:10:44.88 --> 03:10:49.92
at some at one point there there are call signs their code names had been the leopards lines and

1785
03:10:49.92 --> 03:10:57.60
tigers that's what their the different battalions were called could be a good place to stop on

1786
03:10:57.60 --> 03:11:02.000
a goal a little bit further this is actually in the preface of this book and he says when the war ended because

1787
03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:11.84
this is he survived he was home when the war ended I found it a little difficult initially

1788
03:11:12.64 --> 03:11:18.88
knuckling down to civilian life the letter from the government saying you are now a civilian

1789
03:11:18.88 --> 03:11:29.20
seemed so sudden I couldn't face the prospect of an office job so I tried manufacturing making

1790
03:11:29.20 --> 03:11:34.24
handbags before joining my brother-in-law John in his landscape gardening business and then

1791
03:11:34.24 --> 03:11:40.88
branch branching out on my own in the same line of work having an artificial leg didn't help

1792
03:11:41.76 --> 03:11:48.32
but I didn't let it hinder me then the limb fitting center at gilling him kindly reinforced

1793
03:11:48.32 --> 03:11:59.04
my artificial knee for kneeling several times I got a BSA motorbike and side car and had the gear

1794
03:11:59.04 --> 03:12:11.92
is modified to operate by hand instead of foot I built my own house you do the best you can

1795
03:12:11.92 --> 03:12:25.28
again again I mean hey found a little rough to guess what I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to work

1796
03:12:25.28 --> 03:12:29.68
I'm gonna start a business I'm gonna build a house I'm gonna drive a motorbike around the

1797
03:12:29.68 --> 03:12:46.08
country with a side car you do the best you can and I also wanted to say that he wasn't alone

1798
03:12:46.08 --> 03:12:52.72
he obviously need that side car for someone and I'm quite sure that that was one of the

1799
03:12:52.72 --> 03:13:04.08
dedications of the book is for Betty Francis Regis wife who who as he puts it helped me so much

1800
03:13:07.84 --> 03:13:16.08
and the last thing I'll say the last thing I'll read from this book I should say is the

1801
03:13:16.08 --> 03:13:36.72
dedication and he says I dedicate this book to all my airborne friends who never came back

1802
03:13:38.16 --> 03:13:45.04
whose actions made it possible for me and other airborne friends to enjoy over

1803
03:13:45.04 --> 03:14:02.000
70 years of living and that is well that's the parts I'm gonna read from this book but

1804
03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:14.08
um red shirt is died on January 29th 2016 94 years old

1805
03:14:20.80 --> 03:14:27.92
he was the last surviving member of the original first parachute battalion the last of

1806
03:14:27.92 --> 03:14:35.92
those initial 500 men that took that step forward and volunteered for parachute and command

1807
03:14:35.92 --> 03:14:46.24
no training in 1940 in the book the book which is called the memory indoors the book it's actually

1808
03:14:46.24 --> 03:14:52.48
not available on Amazon it's not available in book stores I actually got it I got it from somebody that

1809
03:14:52.48 --> 03:15:00.16
sent it to me and with no inscription in it it says he sent me a note it says dear jacco

1810
03:15:01.04 --> 03:15:10.88
keep up the great work best wishes I believe it says Rick or Rich so that's where I got the book

1811
03:15:10.88 --> 03:15:16.96
from luckily it was sent to me I wouldn't have known about it otherwise if you want to get this book

1812
03:15:16.96 --> 03:15:25.76
which you should it's available from pilots publishing dot co dot uk and there's also a Facebook page

1813
03:15:25.76 --> 03:15:33.60
the memory facebook dot com slash the memory indoors and as it says in the book

1814
03:15:33.60 --> 03:15:43.52
the authors royalties in respect of this book will be donated to the parachute regiment charity

1815
03:15:48.08 --> 03:16:01.68
and there you go another hero teaching us the sacred lesson that we must never forget that

1816
03:16:01.68 --> 03:16:13.04
life is a gift and as rich Curtis tells us what you do with that is you do the best you care

1817
03:16:19.04 --> 03:16:28.000
you do the best to that you care and with that echo echo Charles as I decompressed over here

1818
03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:36.000
a little bit maybe got some ideas of how how we can be the best we can use what do you got for us

1819
03:16:37.52 --> 03:16:47.12
I one of the many things that I took was I don't know if it was his attitude or if that's the

1820
03:16:47.12 --> 03:16:53.92
culture or both you know could be a bit better and then that was the other guy right who was like

1821
03:16:53.92 --> 03:17:01.92
could be a bit better do we do better yeah so on these terrible conditions right could be a bit

1822
03:17:01.92 --> 03:17:08.000
oh oh you talk about the guy that says not too bad not too bad could be better could be better

1823
03:17:09.04 --> 03:17:16.32
so you know like I said probably probably both right attitude plus culture so the attitude right

1824
03:17:16.32 --> 03:17:23.44
one things when you go through adversity you can have that attitude not too bad not too bad could

1825
03:17:23.44 --> 03:17:28.40
be better hey we're about to get overrun and there's a strong possibility we're going to get

1826
03:17:28.40 --> 03:17:34.32
killed right not too bad not too bad could be better yeah could be better positive thought pattern

1827
03:17:34.32 --> 03:17:39.52
there yeah it's kind of like well it's really a good news bad news yeah it's also a realistic view

1828
03:17:39.52 --> 03:17:45.68
right yeah hey I'm still walking hey I still got ammunition yeah and by the way it's not not too bad

1829
03:17:45.68 --> 03:17:50.40
means we don't have to do anything could be better though maybe there's some things we can work on

1830
03:17:50.40 --> 03:17:55.84
yes yeah well I forget what movie it was when he's like I got good news and bad I think

1831
03:17:55.84 --> 03:18:00.96
I'd been tango and cash I don't know maybe maybe not but anyway he said how are good news and bad news

1832
03:18:01.60 --> 03:18:06.48
it was what's the bad news we're almost almost out of gas and he's like well what's the good

1833
03:18:06.48 --> 03:18:13.84
news we're almost dead again so sad it's too good man so just you know speaking of attitudes good

1834
03:18:13.84 --> 03:18:19.36
and bad what we're doing one of the many things is jujitsu okay so that's a really good news bad

1835
03:18:19.36 --> 03:18:26.000
news scenario as well really what's the bad news bad news is you're gonna get choked

1836
03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:34.48
from time to time I know this firsthand that's that's the bad news but the good news is you are

1837
03:18:34.48 --> 03:18:42.72
exposed to an environment that will teach you how to choke others if the need may arise

1838
03:18:42.72 --> 03:18:49.92
good yes so good news is you're getting choked are sorry bad news is you're getting choked

1839
03:18:49.92 --> 03:18:54.40
yes good news is you're getting choked which means you're learning how to defend also choke

1840
03:18:54.40 --> 03:18:59.44
of the people yes so if we're competitively well that could be good or bad news whatever

1841
03:19:00.08 --> 03:19:05.52
so it's a matter of your attitude really how is your attitude like the on getting

1842
03:19:05.52 --> 03:19:10.08
choked you know a lot of learning you know not a little learning what do you call it when you

1843
03:19:10.08 --> 03:19:17.52
relearn something you know lessons lesson repetitive repetitive learning sessions hey it's not any

1844
03:19:17.52 --> 03:19:21.60
not a new population you know it's repetitive well it is it's both I imagine that you get choked one

1845
03:19:21.60 --> 03:19:27.92
time you'll never get choked again no no that's not the one that happens with the jujitsu so we are it

1846
03:19:27.92 --> 03:19:34.64
sounds like jujitsu even though there's a negative possible thing right but it's not too bad not too bad

1847
03:19:34.64 --> 03:19:40.48
it could be better if you try it yes start training the more you train the better you get so there you go

1848
03:19:41.20 --> 03:19:44.80
anyway well we're training we're going to need a geek cause you're going to do geek what do you

1849
03:19:44.80 --> 03:19:49.36
do not do geek well I guess that's possible but okay I'm not recommended no no I recommend

1850
03:19:49.36 --> 03:19:54.48
are you going to fight people all the time that are just wearing shorts no no what if you get

1851
03:19:54.48 --> 03:19:59.28
in a street fight okay if you get a street fight at the beach maybe what if you get a street fight

1852
03:19:59.28 --> 03:20:06.48
at the supermarket yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you were taking the last you

1853
03:20:06.48 --> 03:20:13.36
know and really that's like that's the last one you were broccoli yeah you don't like that you

1854
03:20:13.36 --> 03:20:18.88
gotta fight them for something like this but that's even just one of the actually teeny tiny way

1855
03:20:18.88 --> 03:20:23.04
of looking at it where it's like okay oh I see you're saying because the chance of you getting

1856
03:20:23.04 --> 03:20:26.04
in actual fight are pretty low.

1857
03:20:26.04 --> 03:20:28.52
If you're still trying to get a point,

1858
03:20:28.52 --> 03:20:30.88
not to say that you should, not, you know,

1859
03:20:30.88 --> 03:20:32.64
I'm not saying that, but they're pretty low.

1860
03:20:32.64 --> 03:20:33.48
This is what I'm saying.

1861
03:20:33.48 --> 03:20:35.96
And especially if you're gonna avoid

1862
03:20:35.96 --> 03:20:38.12
getting a new fight, if you're smart,

1863
03:20:38.12 --> 03:20:38.96
you're smart, yes.

1864
03:20:38.96 --> 03:20:40.44
The problem is you can't always avoid it.

1865
03:20:40.44 --> 03:20:43.20
You can maybe a situation and here's the deal.

1866
03:20:43.20 --> 03:20:46.16
If you are forced into a situation

1867
03:20:46.16 --> 03:20:48.12
that where you have to defend yourself

1868
03:20:48.12 --> 03:20:51.08
and you don't know how the result is catastrophic.

1869
03:20:51.08 --> 03:20:52.56
You have to be catastrophic.

1870
03:20:52.56 --> 03:20:55.56
Why have that catastrophic possibility?

1871
03:20:55.56 --> 03:20:57.16
Here's the deal.

1872
03:20:57.16 --> 03:20:59.88
If that's the only reason you were training GJ2,

1873
03:20:59.88 --> 03:21:02.76
if that was the only reason, it would be worth it.

1874
03:21:02.76 --> 03:21:05.08
If that was the only reason, here's the deal.

1875
03:21:05.08 --> 03:21:06.20
That's not the only reason.

1876
03:21:06.20 --> 03:21:08.84
There's a thousand other reasons.

1877
03:21:08.84 --> 03:21:11.08
There's an infinite more reasons, right?

1878
03:21:11.08 --> 03:21:13.48
You're gonna get better conditioning.

1879
03:21:13.48 --> 03:21:15.88
You're gonna get mental stimulus.

1880
03:21:15.88 --> 03:21:17.76
You're gonna meet other human beings.

1881
03:21:17.76 --> 03:21:20.92
You're gonna develop relationships and have friends.

1882
03:21:20.92 --> 03:21:24.60
You're going to think you're gonna develop discipline

1883
03:21:24.60 --> 03:21:26.04
in your life, right?

1884
03:21:26.04 --> 03:21:27.04
This is a long list.

1885
03:21:27.04 --> 03:21:28.48
I mean, this goes on.

1886
03:21:28.48 --> 03:21:31.72
So even if the only thing you were gonna get

1887
03:21:31.72 --> 03:21:34.20
was just you learn how to defend yourself.

1888
03:21:34.20 --> 03:21:35.48
Totally worth it.

1889
03:21:35.48 --> 03:21:37.04
Now not only are you gonna get it to defend yourself,

1890
03:21:37.04 --> 03:21:41.16
you can be able to get these other collateral bonus things.

1891
03:21:41.16 --> 03:21:44.36
Which by the way, some people in order to work

1892
03:21:44.36 --> 03:21:45.92
their cardiovascular system,

1893
03:21:45.92 --> 03:21:48.16
their ride in a spin bike somewhere.

1894
03:21:48.16 --> 03:21:50.68
Someone else in order to work their flexibility

1895
03:21:50.68 --> 03:21:52.32
is doing a yoga class.

1896
03:21:52.32 --> 03:21:54.32
Someone else in order to work their strength

1897
03:21:54.32 --> 03:21:56.56
is lifting some weights.

1898
03:21:56.56 --> 03:21:59.36
I'm not saying, I'm not saying to go do all those things.

1899
03:21:59.36 --> 03:22:01.20
But I'm saying you can get all three of them

1900
03:22:01.20 --> 03:22:04.32
like a little hitter of all three of them.

1901
03:22:04.32 --> 03:22:05.60
No problem.

1902
03:22:05.60 --> 03:22:07.000
Get on the GJ2 bats.

1903
03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:07.84
Yeah.

1904
03:22:07.84 --> 03:22:09.44
Guy, nogie.

1905
03:22:09.44 --> 03:22:10.68
Both of them.

1906
03:22:10.68 --> 03:22:11.64
Yes.

1907
03:22:11.64 --> 03:22:13.48
Well, yes.

1908
03:22:13.48 --> 03:22:16.92
But if you're doing Guy only because someone

1909
03:22:16.92 --> 03:22:19.68
on the street might be wearing certain types of clothes.

1910
03:22:19.68 --> 03:22:23.76
Same exact point I just made.

1911
03:22:23.76 --> 03:22:24.08
Yeah.

1912
03:22:24.08 --> 03:22:27.84
If you're only going to do Guy because of that,

1913
03:22:27.84 --> 03:22:28.68
it's worth it.

1914
03:22:28.68 --> 03:22:30.04
But there's all these other beneficial things.

1915
03:22:30.04 --> 03:22:31.04
Yes.

1916
03:22:31.04 --> 03:22:32.08
And I'll tell you this right now.

1917
03:22:32.08 --> 03:22:35.28
Really the number one thing that'll keep you in GJ2

1918
03:22:35.28 --> 03:22:36.96
doing it, the number one thing.

1919
03:22:36.96 --> 03:22:40.40
And it's maybe even by far for most people

1920
03:22:40.40 --> 03:22:41.24
is that it's fun.

1921
03:22:41.24 --> 03:22:42.08
I was gonna say fun.

1922
03:22:42.08 --> 03:22:42.92
It's great.

1923
03:22:42.92 --> 03:22:44.44
I hope we're aligned with this.

1924
03:22:44.44 --> 03:22:45.28
To you.

1925
03:22:45.28 --> 03:22:47.56
It's true because look, think about it.

1926
03:22:47.56 --> 03:22:48.72
Oh yeah.

1927
03:22:48.72 --> 03:22:50.80
I'm gonna do GJ2 for self defense.

1928
03:22:50.80 --> 03:22:51.44
Oh yeah.

1929
03:22:51.44 --> 03:22:52.28
That's the answer.

1930
03:22:52.28 --> 03:22:56.84
When I started GJ2, me, when I started I was like,

1931
03:22:56.84 --> 03:22:57.80
I'm just gonna do good enough.

1932
03:22:57.80 --> 03:23:00.24
You know, so I can handle myself.

1933
03:23:00.24 --> 03:23:02.28
Which is like I said about six months period.

1934
03:23:02.28 --> 03:23:04.76
About six months, if you're an aggressive guy

1935
03:23:04.76 --> 03:23:07.88
and you're a good athlete or strong or whatever,

1936
03:23:07.88 --> 03:23:09.60
six months you're pretty good to go.

1937
03:23:09.60 --> 03:23:10.44
Right?

1938
03:23:10.44 --> 03:23:11.76
Six months of GJ2, you know what's up.

1939
03:23:11.76 --> 03:23:13.72
It's been 20, whatever years.

1940
03:23:13.72 --> 03:23:14.56
You know?

1941
03:23:14.56 --> 03:23:15.72
Yeah, exactly.

1942
03:23:15.72 --> 03:23:16.56
Right.

1943
03:23:16.56 --> 03:23:20.40
So, oh yeah, don't, I mean, and if you tap someone out,

1944
03:23:20.40 --> 03:23:22.88
try the first time, the first time you tap someone out.

1945
03:23:22.88 --> 03:23:24.68
Then say like, oh yeah, that's the first time.

1946
03:23:24.68 --> 03:23:26.68
Yeah, that's, I made that up, by the way.

1947
03:23:26.68 --> 03:23:29.44
You're trying to impinge on my statement.

1948
03:23:29.44 --> 03:23:32.44
Well, you might have made up saying that maybe bringing it

1949
03:23:32.44 --> 03:23:35.08
to light, but the fact is true.

1950
03:23:35.08 --> 03:23:39.92
So you're saying that I only quoted like a universal truth.

1951
03:23:39.92 --> 03:23:41.76
Yeah, you know self-evident.

1952
03:23:41.76 --> 03:23:45.000
I don't know man, because people used to ask how long

1953
03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:46.36
should I train for?

1954
03:23:46.36 --> 03:23:47.52
Or I had no.

1955
03:23:47.52 --> 03:23:49.32
I mean, we got the question on the podcast.

1956
03:23:49.32 --> 03:23:50.88
How long should I really don't like it?

1957
03:23:50.88 --> 03:23:52.28
And the answer was, at first, like, well,

1958
03:23:52.28 --> 03:23:53.60
you should try it for six months, oh, three months.

1959
03:23:53.60 --> 03:23:54.72
Whatever, no, no, no.

1960
03:23:54.72 --> 03:23:57.28
They train until you tap someone out.

1961
03:23:57.28 --> 03:23:58.76
I don't want to use the term in anger,

1962
03:23:58.76 --> 03:24:00.68
but you tap someone out for real,

1963
03:24:00.68 --> 03:24:02.52
it is just you training environment.

1964
03:24:02.52 --> 03:24:03.12
Yeah.

1965
03:24:03.12 --> 03:24:03.76
And then you're good.

1966
03:24:03.76 --> 03:24:04.60
Yeah, you're right.

1967
03:24:04.60 --> 03:24:06.08
That was the specific answer.

1968
03:24:06.08 --> 03:24:07.24
So yeah, that is yours.

1969
03:24:07.24 --> 03:24:08.08
Okay.

1970
03:24:08.08 --> 03:24:10.72
I'm just making sure, because I'm over here wanting full credit.

1971
03:24:10.72 --> 03:24:12.60
That's not the last.

1972
03:24:12.60 --> 03:24:13.84
If you're training, it just for us.

1973
03:24:13.84 --> 03:24:17.36
If you were to set it in not such a way,

1974
03:24:17.36 --> 03:24:20.20
like the way you set it, man, you thought you set it

1975
03:24:20.20 --> 03:24:24.24
as if you just created like E equals NC squared over there.

1976
03:24:24.24 --> 03:24:25.80
You like you should train until you,

1977
03:24:25.80 --> 03:24:29.52
you were looking down your nose as you said it as if.

1978
03:24:29.52 --> 03:24:31.24
So I had to call you out on that one.

1979
03:24:31.24 --> 03:24:32.84
There my little bro's you go.

1980
03:24:32.84 --> 03:24:33.68
Oh, good.

1981
03:24:33.68 --> 03:24:35.20
I was just remembering the other day.

1982
03:24:35.20 --> 03:24:37.96
Well, the Austrian guy that came came Kurt.

1983
03:24:37.96 --> 03:24:38.52
Is his name?

1984
03:24:38.52 --> 03:24:39.36
Kurt, yeah.

1985
03:24:39.36 --> 03:24:40.20
Young Kurt.

1986
03:24:40.20 --> 03:24:41.04
Yeah, so I asked him.

1987
03:24:41.04 --> 03:24:42.32
I was like, Carl Longing been training.

1988
03:24:42.32 --> 03:24:43.52
He said like a month or something.

1989
03:24:43.52 --> 03:24:45.76
Like some kind of kind of new, really new.

1990
03:24:45.76 --> 03:24:47.96
And so I said, have you tapped anyone out yet?

1991
03:24:47.96 --> 03:24:48.96
And he said, yes.

1992
03:24:48.96 --> 03:24:52.32
So like, all this guy's in the game, I knew her, Eddie.

1993
03:24:52.32 --> 03:24:55.08
So maybe I kind of drew from that recent experience

1994
03:24:55.08 --> 03:24:56.80
to, you know, to kind of say it.

1995
03:24:56.80 --> 03:24:59.000
But in the last, like I was saying, if you train,

1996
03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.56
only for self defense, only for self defense.

1997
03:25:01.56 --> 03:25:03.88
Not because it's fun, not because it's a good workout,

1998
03:25:03.88 --> 03:25:06.04
not because you got into a bunch of new friends,

1999
03:25:06.04 --> 03:25:07.56
not because all this stuff.

2000
03:25:08.76 --> 03:25:11.92
Only for self defense after a while, not even a long while

2001
03:25:11.92 --> 03:25:14.24
after a short while, you can be like, I don't even know

2002
03:25:14.24 --> 03:25:16.96
I'm doing it like, I'm not even, I'm not using it

2003
03:25:16.96 --> 03:25:18.36
to defend myself really.

2004
03:25:18.36 --> 03:25:20.56
Yeah, you know, because those are kind of rare, you know.

2005
03:25:20.56 --> 03:25:22.24
And then you might not do it, you know, especially in the

2006
03:25:22.24 --> 03:25:22.68
not fun.

2007
03:25:22.68 --> 03:25:23.88
So there you go.

2008
03:25:23.88 --> 03:25:26.000
And fun people, like there are people who

2009
03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:29.48
train you just to for decades, literally decades that

2010
03:25:29.48 --> 03:25:31.40
have never got in a fight before.

2011
03:25:31.40 --> 03:25:33.84
Never got in a street fight, never got in it like a physical

2012
03:25:33.84 --> 03:25:34.16
fight.

2013
03:25:34.16 --> 03:25:36.36
So it's like, yeah, are they trained for self defense?

2014
03:25:36.36 --> 03:25:37.04
Yeah, sure.

2015
03:25:37.04 --> 03:25:37.88
Of course.

2016
03:25:37.88 --> 03:25:38.88
But that's not why.

2017
03:25:38.88 --> 03:25:39.40
Why?

2018
03:25:39.40 --> 03:25:40.40
That's not why they're in the game.

2019
03:25:40.40 --> 03:25:41.40
Yeah, exactly.

2020
03:25:41.40 --> 03:25:44.04
So nonetheless, when we do it like I said, do the

2021
03:25:44.04 --> 03:25:45.20
ghee, this can be one of it.

2022
03:25:45.20 --> 03:25:46.52
The other part, it's no game.

2023
03:25:46.52 --> 03:25:49.84
When you do get a ghee, you get an origin key.

2024
03:25:49.84 --> 03:25:53.76
Yeah, 100% 100% best geese by far.

2025
03:25:53.76 --> 03:25:54.92
So, factually.

2026
03:25:54.92 --> 03:25:56.76
Now, same type of thing.

2027
03:25:56.76 --> 03:26:00.36
If you're going to get an origin key, just because you

2028
03:26:00.36 --> 03:26:01.92
want the best ghee, that's good.

2029
03:26:01.92 --> 03:26:02.52
That's a good.

2030
03:26:02.52 --> 03:26:03.52
That's our good reason.

2031
03:26:03.52 --> 03:26:04.64
Like that's solid.

2032
03:26:04.64 --> 03:26:05.32
Right?

2033
03:26:05.32 --> 03:26:06.36
That's my reason.

2034
03:26:06.36 --> 03:26:08.92
If you peel back the layer a little bit and you want to

2035
03:26:08.92 --> 03:26:10.44
find out what else you're going to get, well, what

2036
03:26:10.44 --> 03:26:12.84
else you're going to get, you're going to get the fact that

2037
03:26:12.84 --> 03:26:17.40
you are literally rebuilding an industry and a

2038
03:26:17.40 --> 03:26:23.20
community and an economy inside of America.

2039
03:26:23.20 --> 03:26:26.36
You know, that's a little, that's not even a little bonus.

2040
03:26:26.36 --> 03:26:28.44
Like there's some people that would look at that and say,

2041
03:26:28.44 --> 03:26:30.60
I'm going to buy an origin key just because of that.

2042
03:26:30.60 --> 03:26:31.60
Yeah.

2043
03:26:31.60 --> 03:26:34.04
And then if I even do, you get to that sort of second

2044
03:26:34.04 --> 03:26:35.04
thing.

2045
03:26:35.04 --> 03:26:36.04
Yeah, I can do it.

2046
03:26:36.04 --> 03:26:39.40
Now, if you're feeling it, let's say you're feeling it.

2047
03:26:39.40 --> 03:26:41.04
You're feeling that part.

2048
03:26:41.04 --> 03:26:44.92
You're feeling like America, you're feeling the economy,

2049
03:26:44.92 --> 03:26:46.76
you're feeling the community, you're feeling the industry,

2050
03:26:46.76 --> 03:26:48.52
you're going to bring it back, you're going to help.

2051
03:26:48.52 --> 03:26:53.32
But you still haven't gotten over the hump of showing

2052
03:26:53.32 --> 03:26:55.40
average of your kids to school.

2053
03:26:55.40 --> 03:26:57.28
But you still want to support it.

2054
03:26:57.28 --> 03:26:59.000
It's OK.

2055
03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.60
It's, we'll say, I step in the right direction.

2056
03:27:01.60 --> 03:27:04.64
We have genes that you can get.

2057
03:27:04.64 --> 03:27:06.08
You can get genes.

2058
03:27:06.08 --> 03:27:07.72
You're still going to help those other three.

2059
03:27:07.72 --> 03:27:10.84
I would prefer the first thing that you get.

2060
03:27:10.84 --> 03:27:14.04
In all seriousness, the first thing I would prefer you get

2061
03:27:14.04 --> 03:27:16.84
is a geek because that tells me you're going to get on the map.

2062
03:27:16.84 --> 03:27:19.20
If you, if you, because so many people,

2063
03:27:19.20 --> 03:27:21.92
and you know what, every, well, you know what, 99% of people

2064
03:27:21.92 --> 03:27:23.96
say when they finally start due to it,

2065
03:27:23.96 --> 03:27:26.80
I wish I would have started, well, when I first

2066
03:27:26.80 --> 03:27:29.40
this, blah, that's what people say.

2067
03:27:29.40 --> 03:27:30.32
Tell you this.

2068
03:27:30.32 --> 03:27:33.64
I'm meeting people now that are purple belts that started

2069
03:27:33.64 --> 03:27:35.76
due to when they started listening to this podcast.

2070
03:27:35.76 --> 03:27:39.16
So where about probably three to four years away

2071
03:27:39.16 --> 03:27:40.44
from having somebody that started you

2072
03:27:40.44 --> 03:27:45.000
to listen to this podcast will be a black belt in GJ2,

2073
03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:46.76
which is an awesome achievement.

2074
03:27:46.76 --> 03:27:48.80
Here's the thing.

2075
03:27:48.80 --> 03:27:51.60
There's also people that will say I started listening

2076
03:27:51.60 --> 03:27:54.12
to podcast in three years when I'm by before I started.

2077
03:27:54.12 --> 03:27:56.28
You could have been a purple belt.

2078
03:27:56.28 --> 03:27:56.96
Don't wait.

2079
03:27:56.96 --> 03:27:58.44
I'm telling you right now.

2080
03:27:58.44 --> 03:28:02.04
Like, I'm telling you right now, start your GJ2.

2081
03:28:02.04 --> 03:28:04.48
In fact, I'm telling you that.

2082
03:28:04.48 --> 03:28:09.16
And by the way, we touched on a little kind of combatives,

2083
03:28:09.16 --> 03:28:10.64
hand-to-hand combat in this book.

2084
03:28:10.64 --> 03:28:11.48
All right.

2085
03:28:11.48 --> 03:28:16.68
And there's a whole line of a whole thread we can pull on that

2086
03:28:16.68 --> 03:28:20.88
and we will at some point the British combatives program

2087
03:28:20.88 --> 03:28:23.08
World War II, very cool.

2088
03:28:23.08 --> 03:28:27.44
I've done a read a bunch about it and we'll dig into it here

2089
03:28:27.44 --> 03:28:28.80
because it's pretty awesome.

2090
03:28:28.80 --> 03:28:33.000
The way they were doing things, their concepts, et cetera.

2091
03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:37.76
But if they were alive today, they'd be loaned

2092
03:28:37.76 --> 03:28:40.000
the GJ2 all day.

2093
03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:41.000
Yeah.

2094
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.48
And they'd be getting American geese even from England.

2095
03:28:45.48 --> 03:28:46.48
They'd be like, you know what?

2096
03:28:46.48 --> 03:28:48.24
Those GJs get to yank.

2097
03:28:48.24 --> 03:28:49.68
Get yourself a yanky geese.

2098
03:28:49.68 --> 03:28:50.20
Right?

2099
03:28:50.20 --> 03:28:53.04
Because again, really the primary reason is because it's

2100
03:28:53.04 --> 03:28:54.64
factually the best one.

2101
03:28:54.64 --> 03:28:55.24
Yeah.

2102
03:28:55.24 --> 03:28:58.60
Same thing for jeans where I would say,

2103
03:28:58.60 --> 03:29:03.52
since I got my pair of origin jeans, which is like,

2104
03:29:03.52 --> 03:29:05.48
oh, I'll go when you think about it when they came out.

2105
03:29:05.48 --> 03:29:08.36
So while I go, I have not worn any other jeans ever.

2106
03:29:08.36 --> 03:29:09.36
No.

2107
03:29:09.36 --> 03:29:10.36
Yeah.

2108
03:29:10.36 --> 03:29:11.96
Why would you, why would you do that?

2109
03:29:11.96 --> 03:29:13.60
No, there's not even a reason to do that.

2110
03:29:13.60 --> 03:29:13.96
There's not even a reason.

2111
03:29:13.96 --> 03:29:14.96
I only have one pair too.

2112
03:29:14.96 --> 03:29:19.88
Or I don't have three but, unless that's the only ones I wear.

2113
03:29:19.88 --> 03:29:22.88
Also, they, we have other stuff here at origin.

2114
03:29:22.88 --> 03:29:23.72
We do.

2115
03:29:23.72 --> 03:29:26.28
So yeah, joggers, you know, more athletic wear,

2116
03:29:26.28 --> 03:29:27.84
all kinds of good stuff.

2117
03:29:27.84 --> 03:29:31.28
You go to originmain.com main like the state.

2118
03:29:31.28 --> 03:29:34.72
Also supplements, keep yourself in the game.

2119
03:29:34.72 --> 03:29:35.72
Yep.

2120
03:29:35.72 --> 03:29:38.28
Propel yourself further down the path.

2121
03:29:38.28 --> 03:29:39.12
Yep.

2122
03:29:39.12 --> 03:29:39.96
As it were.

2123
03:29:39.96 --> 03:29:40.80
Yep.

2124
03:29:40.80 --> 03:29:41.96
Get yourself.

2125
03:29:41.96 --> 03:29:43.76
Joint warfare and Krooile.

2126
03:29:43.76 --> 03:29:45.16
Out of the gate.

2127
03:29:45.16 --> 03:29:49.36
Once again, and I feel bad because I did this on social media.

2128
03:29:49.36 --> 03:29:51.12
Where the guy was like, hey, what can I do to help?

2129
03:29:51.12 --> 03:29:54.44
And I was like, I, I didn't want to be that guy.

2130
03:29:54.44 --> 03:29:56.52
That was like, well, you know, here,

2131
03:29:56.52 --> 03:29:57.76
try my supplement line.

2132
03:29:57.76 --> 03:30:00.60
You know, I just don't, I just don't want to be that guy.

2133
03:30:00.60 --> 03:30:01.60
And then later I felt bad.

2134
03:30:01.60 --> 03:30:04.56
I was like, I should have just been straight up and said, hey, listen, man,

2135
03:30:04.56 --> 03:30:05.56
do whatever you want to do.

2136
03:30:05.56 --> 03:30:08.76
Get yourself some Krooile and join warfare immediately.

2137
03:30:08.76 --> 03:30:09.76
Order that.

2138
03:30:09.76 --> 03:30:10.76
Oh, what?

2139
03:30:10.76 --> 03:30:13.16
You're 36 years old and you fail in sore and you're doing it.

2140
03:30:13.16 --> 03:30:15.96
And you're at, I think I was literally asking me how my joints are.

2141
03:30:15.96 --> 03:30:17.96
I didn't say it.

2142
03:30:17.96 --> 03:30:19.28
Because I don't want to be that guy.

2143
03:30:19.28 --> 03:30:20.28
Yeah.

2144
03:30:20.28 --> 03:30:21.28
Right now I'm being that guy.

2145
03:30:21.28 --> 03:30:22.28
You know what guy I'm being?

2146
03:30:22.28 --> 03:30:24.08
The guy that's actually trying to help people.

2147
03:30:24.08 --> 03:30:26.08
Because I didn't help that guy as much as I could have.

2148
03:30:26.08 --> 03:30:28.64
I should have said, listen, do what I, you know, be consistent.

2149
03:30:28.64 --> 03:30:30.64
Don't take big chunks of time off.

2150
03:30:30.64 --> 03:30:33.20
Order a Krooile and oil.

2151
03:30:33.20 --> 03:30:34.92
Join warfare right now.

2152
03:30:34.92 --> 03:30:36.32
That's what you have to do.

2153
03:30:36.32 --> 03:30:37.12
That's my recommendation.

2154
03:30:37.12 --> 03:30:38.84
I feel bad for not doing that.

2155
03:30:38.84 --> 03:30:41.20
I will try not to make that mistake again.

2156
03:30:41.20 --> 03:30:43.20
No, I had the same experience.

2157
03:30:43.20 --> 03:30:46.68
I went on with Pete and Brian hands in daylight.

2158
03:30:46.68 --> 03:30:47.52
Okay.

2159
03:30:47.52 --> 03:30:49.12
I did an episode with him recently.

2160
03:30:49.12 --> 03:30:52.84
And he was, and Pete was saying, oh, yeah, you're like durable.

2161
03:30:52.84 --> 03:30:54.12
Because I don't have like ailments.

2162
03:30:54.12 --> 03:30:55.72
You know, Pete's jammed up his back.

2163
03:30:55.72 --> 03:30:56.72
Yeah.

2164
03:30:56.72 --> 03:30:59.36
This is like, you know, we're, I'm older than him actually.

2165
03:30:59.36 --> 03:31:01.000
And he's like, oh, yeah, you're durable.

2166
03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:06.24
You know, and I was like, yeah, I mean, because I never thought I was durable at all.

2167
03:31:06.24 --> 03:31:09.000
Like, that's actually being hanged out with me.

2168
03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:11.000
Yeah, exactly.

2169
03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.36
But I was pretty fragile to be honest with you.

2170
03:31:13.36 --> 03:31:14.36
It's fine.

2171
03:31:14.36 --> 03:31:15.36
You guys might, because you know what Pete said to me?

2172
03:31:15.36 --> 03:31:19.44
Like, when he was just out here, he was like, you're, he told me I was durable.

2173
03:31:19.44 --> 03:31:20.44
Well, you're, you're.

2174
03:31:20.44 --> 03:31:22.48
So I figured that you guys had that conversation.

2175
03:31:22.48 --> 03:31:24.40
Because I said, that's what I call told me one time.

2176
03:31:24.40 --> 03:31:25.68
Anyway, you told me, when you told me that,

2177
03:31:25.68 --> 03:31:29.20
they've been like, it, when you told it to me, it had been like you had been contemplating

2178
03:31:29.20 --> 03:31:31.000
it for quite some time.

2179
03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:32.32
You were like, you know what I figured out about you?

2180
03:31:32.32 --> 03:31:33.32
And I was like, what?

2181
03:31:33.32 --> 03:31:34.32
And you said, you're durable.

2182
03:31:34.32 --> 03:31:35.32
Yeah, like a tank.

2183
03:31:35.32 --> 03:31:36.92
I was like, that's interesting.

2184
03:31:36.92 --> 03:31:38.60
And I had to kind of agree with it.

2185
03:31:38.60 --> 03:31:39.60
Yes.

2186
03:31:39.60 --> 03:31:41.76
And so he said that I was durable.

2187
03:31:41.76 --> 03:31:44.56
And I was like, well, and we even said, no, jocals durable.

2188
03:31:44.56 --> 03:31:48.44
I don't, and then, but then, I guess on in a way, yeah, because you're, you're, you

2189
03:31:48.44 --> 03:31:50.04
bounce back from some pretty solid.

2190
03:31:50.04 --> 03:31:51.04
Pretty solid.

2191
03:31:51.04 --> 03:31:53.24
You know, how many new surgeries you had?

2192
03:31:53.24 --> 03:31:57.20
One knee surgery, but if you need injuries, plus my loose knees, I know.

2193
03:31:57.20 --> 03:31:58.20
I know.

2194
03:31:58.20 --> 03:31:59.20
I know.

2195
03:31:59.20 --> 03:32:01.52
They're loose for real.

2196
03:32:01.52 --> 03:32:03.88
Anyway, so they pop out all the time.

2197
03:32:03.88 --> 03:32:06.88
That means what I'm saying, you know, and they'll get more and more squats.

2198
03:32:06.88 --> 03:32:08.20
I'd decide to do the process.

2199
03:32:08.20 --> 03:32:09.20
And how's this?

2200
03:32:09.20 --> 03:32:10.20
I do do squats.

2201
03:32:10.20 --> 03:32:14.000
And actually now, I go deep like all the way down like you.

2202
03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:15.000
Yeah.

2203
03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:16.000
Oh, yeah, that's the reason.

2204
03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:17.000
And how's they feeling tighter?

2205
03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:18.000
No, no.

2206
03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:19.000
Great.

2207
03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:20.000
I mean, same.

2208
03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:21.000
No, they still pop out in jiu-jitsu.

2209
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:22.36
Like when I do better, like, anyways, it doesn't matter.

2210
03:32:22.36 --> 03:32:27.40
The loose, clinically, the doctor, orthopedic surgeon told me that.

2211
03:32:27.40 --> 03:32:30.40
Anyway, so anyway, I don't feel like that.

2212
03:32:30.40 --> 03:32:32.40
I don't feel like that.

2213
03:32:32.40 --> 03:32:37.24
Anyway, given the circumstances, yeah, I guess I am pretty durable.

2214
03:32:37.24 --> 03:32:39.48
But anyway, the point is we're talking about this stuff.

2215
03:32:39.48 --> 03:32:43.60
And then, like, I'm like saying, like, oh, yeah, plus, I don't take time out of it.

2216
03:32:43.60 --> 03:32:48.28
And then I'm naturally going into plus to take during more fair, or everyday, like, religiously,

2217
03:32:48.28 --> 03:32:54.72
you know, so it's basically the point was to say you got to actively be durable, you know,

2218
03:32:54.72 --> 03:32:55.72
kind of thing.

2219
03:32:55.72 --> 03:32:56.72
Oh, yeah.

2220
03:32:56.72 --> 03:32:58.88
But they're not like purely genetic apparently, right?

2221
03:32:58.88 --> 03:33:00.28
Increase your durability.

2222
03:33:00.28 --> 03:33:02.52
Also, we got other stuff.

2223
03:33:02.52 --> 03:33:07.08
We got discipline go in a can, which is just awesome.

2224
03:33:07.08 --> 03:33:08.08
It's awesome.

2225
03:33:08.08 --> 03:33:10.44
No sugar.

2226
03:33:10.44 --> 03:33:12.20
It tastes delicious.

2227
03:33:12.20 --> 03:33:15.20
It has some caffeine in it.

2228
03:33:15.20 --> 03:33:17.68
It has some, it's got some other things in it.

2229
03:33:17.68 --> 03:33:20.04
But it's got a little kick that goes with it.

2230
03:33:20.04 --> 03:33:23.48
Same with the discipline powder, which is what I drink pretty much all the time.

2231
03:33:23.48 --> 03:33:27.000
It's almost, it doesn't have too much caffeine in the discipline powder.

2232
03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:31.56
It's got like 15 milligrams, a scoop, which is not crazy at all.

2233
03:33:31.56 --> 03:33:35.12
It's a micro dose, even if you have two scoops.

2234
03:33:35.12 --> 03:33:36.12
What's that?

2235
03:33:36.12 --> 03:33:37.92
30 million, you know, 45 million grams for three scoops.

2236
03:33:37.92 --> 03:33:39.16
It's not that big of a deal.

2237
03:33:39.16 --> 03:33:44.28
But taste delicious has some other ingredients that give you a little.

2238
03:33:44.28 --> 03:33:48.88
Do you?

2239
03:33:48.88 --> 03:33:51.96
Protein, the form of the dessert.

2240
03:33:51.96 --> 03:33:57.12
For adults and kids, even though it's like sure the kids are going to drink the regular

2241
03:33:57.12 --> 03:33:59.72
milk and let's face it.

2242
03:33:59.72 --> 03:34:01.12
The adults are going to drink the word.

2243
03:34:01.12 --> 03:34:02.12
Kid mobs.

2244
03:34:02.12 --> 03:34:09.28
So much where your kid mock, I'm surprised I haven't turned gone down in age.

2245
03:34:09.28 --> 03:34:12.36
The less those are there too.

2246
03:34:12.36 --> 03:34:14.24
And they taste insane.

2247
03:34:14.24 --> 03:34:15.24
That's the thing.

2248
03:34:15.24 --> 03:34:17.52
So that's that.

2249
03:34:17.52 --> 03:34:24.92
Also, Jocquay T. And by the way, right now, this all these supplements that you might

Appreciate it.

2253

And this is where you can get the gear.

2265
03:35:06.72 --> 03:35:09.24
I don't really use the word gear that much, but I'm going to use it.

2266
03:35:09.24 --> 03:35:14.64
The gear, t-shirt, trash guards, hoodies, hats, that kind of stuff to represent the

2267
03:35:14.64 --> 03:35:15.64
pair.

2268
03:35:15.64 --> 03:35:19.48
Gear, Discipline equals freedom, good.

2269
03:35:19.48 --> 03:35:21.32
Take the high ground or the high ground.

2270
03:35:21.32 --> 03:35:23.32
We'll take you.

2271
03:35:23.32 --> 03:35:24.32
That's that, Jocquay.

2272
03:35:24.32 --> 03:35:27.08
Unless you want to represent while you're on the path, that's where you do it.

2273
03:35:27.08 --> 03:35:28.56
JocquayStore.com.

2276
03:35:37.24 --> 03:35:39.80
well, I'm not quite sure yet.

I'm asking, you just, you know, go for it.

2278
03:35:43.88 --> 03:35:44.88
Just get crazy.

2279
03:35:44.88 --> 03:35:45.88
Get crazy.

2280
03:35:45.88 --> 03:35:48.88
And subscribe.

2281
03:35:48.88 --> 03:35:52.52
I don't even know why someone would not subscribe.

2282
03:35:52.52 --> 03:35:54.52
You know, just trying it out, I guess.

2283
03:35:54.52 --> 03:35:55.52
You know, I can't even make it.

2284
03:35:55.52 --> 03:35:56.52
Make sense.

2285
03:35:56.52 --> 03:36:00.60
If you also want to leave a review, some people leave really good reviews.

2286
03:36:00.60 --> 03:36:03.96
And by good reviews, I don't mean, hey, it's a great podcast.

2287
03:36:03.96 --> 03:36:07.20
I probably like the insight that, no, I mean,

2288
03:36:07.20 --> 03:36:10.76
reviews that are, let's just say there's, they've got layers.

2289
03:36:10.76 --> 03:36:11.44
layers.

2290
03:36:11.44 --> 03:36:12.40
Fun, colorful.

2291
03:36:12.40 --> 03:36:14.96
Color, they make me laugh, they make me chuckle.

2292
03:36:14.96 --> 03:36:15.96
I'm sure.

2293
03:36:15.96 --> 03:36:17.96
Don't forget about the ground in vodka.

2294
03:36:17.96 --> 03:36:24.48
So shines a good deed, you know, weary world.

2295
03:36:24.48 --> 03:36:25.48
Yeah.

2296
03:36:25.48 --> 03:36:27.48
Sorry, I don't know.

2297
03:36:27.48 --> 03:36:32.64
I don't know what you have in scene, Willy Wonk and the chocolate factory lately.

2298
03:36:32.64 --> 03:36:35.96
No, to be, I don't think of seeing no one in any of them.

2299
03:36:35.96 --> 03:36:37.60
I saw part of the Johnny Depp one.

2300
03:36:37.60 --> 03:36:39.08
No, I part of it.

2301
03:36:39.08 --> 03:36:40.08
Fowl.

2302
03:36:40.08 --> 03:36:41.08
Well, thank you.

2303
03:36:41.08 --> 03:36:42.96
You got to watch the original one.

2304
03:36:42.96 --> 03:36:43.96
It's awesome.

2305
03:36:43.96 --> 03:36:44.60
It's a great movie.

2306
03:36:44.60 --> 03:36:45.60
All right.

2307
03:36:45.60 --> 03:36:47.36
Well, interesting.

2308
03:36:47.36 --> 03:36:48.32
That's interesting.

2309
03:36:48.32 --> 03:36:49.32
Jock, you heard it.

2310
03:36:49.32 --> 03:36:50.32
Jocko.

2311
03:36:50.32 --> 03:36:51.32
Watch that.

2312
03:36:51.32 --> 03:36:53.76
We, Lee Wonkka and the chocolate factory isn't awesome.

2313
03:36:53.76 --> 03:36:55.72
Yes, it is an awesome movie.

2314
03:36:55.72 --> 03:36:56.72
Okay.

2315
03:36:56.72 --> 03:36:58.72
Oh, go watch it.

2316
03:36:58.72 --> 03:36:59.72
Amen.

2317
03:36:59.72 --> 03:37:00.72
Maybe I'll look into it.

2318
03:37:00.72 --> 03:37:02.20
Maybe he'll watch a report back.

2319
03:37:02.20 --> 03:37:04.20
Less grounded podcast.

2320
03:37:04.20 --> 03:37:07.40
I mean, I'm over here throwing out quotes from the movie, right?

2321
03:37:07.40 --> 03:37:08.40
We're doing Shakespeare.

2322
03:37:08.40 --> 03:37:12.08
We're doing, we're doing the memory endurance, but we're also throwing out some Willy

2323
03:37:12.08 --> 03:37:13.08
Wonkka.

2324
03:37:13.08 --> 03:37:15.44
Charlie and the chocolate factory.

2325
03:37:15.44 --> 03:37:16.44
Sure.

2326
03:37:16.44 --> 03:37:17.44
All right.

2327
03:37:17.44 --> 03:37:18.44
Well, there you go.

2328
03:37:18.44 --> 03:37:19.44
It will make sense.

2329
03:37:19.44 --> 03:37:23.84
Anyway, like I'll say, I'm grounded podcast as a podcast about life.

2330
03:37:23.84 --> 03:37:24.84
Jiu-Jitsu.

2331
03:37:24.84 --> 03:37:25.84
Life.

2332
03:37:25.84 --> 03:37:26.84
Life.

2333
03:37:26.84 --> 03:37:29.96
Jiu-Jitsu is infused into life.

2334
03:37:29.96 --> 03:37:31.68
Or is life infused into Jiu-Jitsu?

2335
03:37:31.68 --> 03:37:32.68
Both.

2336
03:37:32.68 --> 03:37:37.32
More important, I think life is reflective of Jiu-Jitsu and Jiu-Jitsu is reflective of life.

2337
03:37:37.32 --> 03:37:42.08
So if you can learn from one, you will learn about both, which is important.

2338
03:37:42.08 --> 03:37:43.08
It's true.

2339
03:37:43.08 --> 03:37:46.44
Not quite as often as chocolate podcasts, but it's out there.

2340
03:37:46.44 --> 03:37:49.72
So, which is weird, because it's like really hard to make this podcast.

2341
03:37:49.72 --> 03:37:51.92
It's really easy to make a grounded one.

2342
03:37:51.92 --> 03:37:52.92
But you know what we do?

2343
03:37:52.92 --> 03:37:53.92
We do the hard things.

2344
03:37:53.92 --> 03:37:54.92
Yes.

2345
03:37:54.92 --> 03:37:55.92
That's what we focus on.

2346
03:37:55.92 --> 03:37:56.92
Prioritize.

2347
03:37:56.92 --> 03:37:57.92
Prioritize.

2348
03:37:57.92 --> 03:37:59.92
And what is the second part?

2349
03:37:59.92 --> 03:38:00.92
In the way.

2350
03:38:00.92 --> 03:38:01.92
In the way.

2351
03:38:01.92 --> 03:38:02.92
You know what's just got a knife in the drum, bro?

2352
03:38:02.92 --> 03:38:09.12
Oh, so warrior kid podcast, which is a good one for the young trooper, warrior

2353
03:38:09.12 --> 03:38:10.12
kids.

2354
03:38:10.12 --> 03:38:14.36
And don't be shy if you're a parent to listen, because you're in a learn.

2355
03:38:14.36 --> 03:38:17.32
I wish I would have that podcast as a parent when my kids were young.

2356
03:38:17.32 --> 03:38:19.36
Actually, in a way, it's a parent podcast.

2357
03:38:19.36 --> 03:38:20.36
It is.

2358
03:38:20.36 --> 03:38:21.36
It is.

2359
03:38:21.36 --> 03:38:22.36
It is.

2360
03:38:22.36 --> 03:38:28.24
Yeah, because you know, like, when you hear of certain people's childhoods, for whatever.

2361
03:38:28.24 --> 03:38:32.20
Like, certain like people who are like successful in XYZ, whether it be athletes, whatever,

2362
03:38:32.20 --> 03:38:33.20
right?

2363
03:38:33.20 --> 03:38:34.20
And you learn about their childhood.

2364
03:38:34.20 --> 03:38:38.32
You could probably learn some solid stuff like, oh, I just just had one model.

2365
03:38:38.32 --> 03:38:39.32
Yeah.

2366
03:38:39.32 --> 03:38:40.92
Let me try to, you know, start incorporating it.

2367
03:38:40.92 --> 03:38:41.92
Yeah.

2368
03:38:41.92 --> 03:38:42.92
Yeah.

2369
03:38:42.92 --> 03:38:43.92
So let's do the work.

2370
03:38:43.92 --> 03:38:44.92
If I can say it's all in there.

2371
03:38:44.92 --> 03:38:45.92
Yep.

2372
03:38:45.92 --> 03:38:51.04
Speaking of warrior kids, don't forget about the warrior kid soap at IrishOxoranch.com.

2373
03:38:51.04 --> 03:38:53.60
And actually right now live.

2374
03:38:53.60 --> 03:38:57.36
Live is a new.

2375
03:38:57.36 --> 03:38:58.36
Is it model?

2376
03:38:58.36 --> 03:38:59.36
What's it called?

2377
03:38:59.36 --> 03:39:00.36
A new model.

2378
03:39:00.36 --> 03:39:02.36
It's not flavor because you don't eat it.

2379
03:39:02.36 --> 03:39:03.36
It's a new.

2380
03:39:03.36 --> 03:39:04.36
It's a new.

2381
03:39:04.36 --> 03:39:07.36
I didn't even know.

2382
03:39:07.36 --> 03:39:08.36
No, it's a new.

2383
03:39:08.36 --> 03:39:09.36
Come on.

2384
03:39:09.36 --> 03:39:10.36
I'm thinking of regular soap.

2385
03:39:10.36 --> 03:39:12.36
So, you know, like, I don't know what do they say.

2386
03:39:12.36 --> 03:39:13.36
It's a new version.

2387
03:39:13.36 --> 03:39:14.36
Right.

2388
03:39:14.36 --> 03:39:18.20
We have a new model, a new version of soap.

2389
03:39:18.20 --> 03:39:22.000
You have actually have to check it out because it's so legit.

2390
03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:24.36
It's called, well, what it does.

2391
03:39:24.36 --> 03:39:27.32
Let me tell you how much it does is it's got some.

2392
03:39:27.32 --> 03:39:28.32
Anti-microbial.

2393
03:39:28.32 --> 03:39:29.32
Anti-microbial.

2394
03:39:29.32 --> 03:39:31.32
I think it does.

2395
03:39:31.32 --> 03:39:38.32
It's got some anti-fungal natural elements to it.

2396
03:39:38.32 --> 03:39:41.76
One of those elements is like it's got like tea tree oil.

2397
03:39:41.76 --> 03:39:44.72
It's got activated charcoal.

2398
03:39:44.72 --> 03:39:45.72
And what's cool.

2399
03:39:45.72 --> 03:39:46.72
So, this is what's cool.

2400
03:39:46.72 --> 03:39:50.20
So, first of all, the soap is called killer soap.

2401
03:39:50.20 --> 03:39:51.20
That's the name of the soap.

2402
03:39:51.20 --> 03:39:57.000
But what, it couldn't be any more perfect because it is because of the charcoal.

2403
03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.000
It's black.

2404
03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:00.68
So, it's black.

2405
03:40:00.68 --> 03:40:02.68
And it's awesome.

2406
03:40:02.68 --> 03:40:05.64
So, get yourself some killer soap from IrishRokes Ranch.com.

2407
03:40:05.64 --> 03:40:08.24
And by the way, this is a kid that's making it.

2408
03:40:08.24 --> 03:40:11.56
A kid that started a company and pitched me.

2409
03:40:11.56 --> 03:40:13.20
You know what stuff I get pitched?

2410
03:40:13.20 --> 03:40:15.20
I get pitched up five times a day.

2411
03:40:15.20 --> 03:40:17.60
I get pitched something, this, that, and the other.

2412
03:40:17.60 --> 03:40:18.60
This kid pitched me.

2413
03:40:18.60 --> 03:40:19.60
But, you know, he pitched me.

2414
03:40:19.60 --> 03:40:21.64
He's like, hey, I'm already rolling.

2415
03:40:21.64 --> 03:40:22.64
Yeah.

2416
03:40:22.64 --> 03:40:23.92
You know, I'm already rolling.

2417
03:40:23.92 --> 03:40:25.24
I'm already making soap.

2418
03:40:25.24 --> 03:40:26.96
By the way, I'm 10.

2419
03:40:26.96 --> 03:40:29.56
I've got a soap production line.

2420
03:40:29.56 --> 03:40:31.28
And I've got vertical integration.

2421
03:40:31.28 --> 03:40:33.56
I mean, he was getting after it.

2422
03:40:33.56 --> 03:40:34.56
Yeah.

2423
03:40:34.56 --> 03:40:36.80
So, he hasn't even pitched me.

2424
03:40:36.80 --> 03:40:38.80
Pitched me.

2425
03:40:38.80 --> 03:40:42.000
And of course, he didn't even pitch me by, could you, I know, he was like, I want you to know

2426
03:40:42.000 --> 03:40:43.80
what I'm doing.

2427
03:40:43.80 --> 03:40:46.20
There are openings if you would like to get a piece.

2428
03:40:46.20 --> 03:40:47.20
Yeah.

2429
03:40:47.20 --> 03:40:50.48
I'm like, you know, and you invest in the people, right?

2430
03:40:50.48 --> 03:40:54.32
I'm looking at a kid that's 10 years old that's sending a business plan, that's sending

2431
03:40:54.32 --> 03:40:55.32
samples.

2432
03:40:55.32 --> 03:40:56.32
What do you like?

2433
03:40:56.32 --> 03:41:01.76
So, anyways, we went deep to cover the grappling and just the luck.

2434
03:41:01.76 --> 03:41:04.64
Look, there's nasty things in the world.

2435
03:41:04.64 --> 03:41:10.48
And if you want to, you can get some killer soap, and that will help you as a person

2436
03:41:10.48 --> 03:41:13.32
inside and out.

2437
03:41:13.32 --> 03:41:15.16
Just stay clean.

2438
03:41:15.16 --> 03:41:16.16
Oh, yeah.

2439
03:41:16.16 --> 03:41:17.16
Yeah.

2440
03:41:17.16 --> 03:41:18.16
Good logo too.

2441
03:41:18.16 --> 03:41:21.24
We just make everyone suffer through our own little inside jokes.

2442
03:41:21.24 --> 03:41:22.88
There goes the good one.

2443
03:41:22.88 --> 03:41:23.88
Please stop.

2444
03:41:23.88 --> 03:41:24.88
It's true.

2445
03:41:24.88 --> 03:41:25.88
It's all true.

2446
03:41:25.88 --> 03:41:26.88
I can't even be mad.

2447
03:41:26.88 --> 03:41:29.68
So, yes, Irish Oaks Ranch.com.

2448
03:41:29.68 --> 03:41:31.32
That's where you get it.

2449
03:41:31.32 --> 03:41:33.64
And as Joc was saying, hey, stay clean, man.

2450
03:41:33.64 --> 03:41:34.64
Right.

2451
03:41:34.64 --> 03:41:35.64
Anyway, YouTube channel as well.

2452
03:41:35.64 --> 03:41:38.04
Joc podcast does have a YouTube channel.

03:41:38.04 --> 03:41:41.80
So, you can get the video version and also excerpts and stuff like that.

Some enhanced videos.

2455
03:41:43.28 --> 03:41:47.92
Very English levels of acceptance and very, that was of enhancement.

2456
03:41:47.92 --> 03:41:48.92
Very enhanced.

2457
03:41:48.92 --> 03:41:51.64
For a life from people.

2458
03:41:51.64 --> 03:41:52.92

2461
03:41:58.64 --> 03:41:59.64
I said it.

2462
03:41:59.64 --> 03:42:00.64
I said it.

2463
03:42:00.64 --> 03:42:01.64
You can you can you.

2464
03:42:01.64 --> 03:42:02.64
It is.

2465
03:42:02.64 --> 03:42:03.64
It is.

2466
03:42:03.64 --> 03:42:04.64
Maybe.

2467
03:42:04.64 --> 03:42:05.92
How many times was that funny?

2468
03:42:05.92 --> 03:42:07.88
I don't know, but it wasn't more than 29.

2469
03:42:07.88 --> 03:42:10.28
It's only funny.

2470
03:42:10.28 --> 03:42:11.28
It's only funny.

2471
03:42:11.28 --> 03:42:12.64
You say it because it's so hard.

2472
03:42:12.64 --> 03:42:13.64
I don't know.

2473
03:42:13.64 --> 03:42:14.64
I can't even say it anymore.

2474
03:42:14.64 --> 03:42:15.64
Yeah.

2475
03:42:15.64 --> 03:42:17.24
Because it's worn out, bro.

2476
03:42:17.24 --> 03:42:18.92
So just note, no more.

2477
03:42:18.92 --> 03:42:19.92
No stop.

2478
03:42:19.92 --> 03:42:22.92
No, it is.

2479
03:42:22.92 --> 03:42:25.12
Also, don't forget about psychological warfare.

2480
03:42:25.12 --> 03:42:29.36
Little psychological hitter.

2481
03:42:29.36 --> 03:42:32.16
And I actually had the person point out to me.

2482
03:42:32.16 --> 03:42:34.36
Hey, that was me.

2483
03:42:34.36 --> 03:42:35.36
Now, so that's one.

2484
03:42:35.36 --> 03:42:39.08
I also had the person point out to me that there was a name for the type of shooting that

2485
03:42:39.08 --> 03:42:41.60
we talked about, which is where you're shooting at where things are.

2486
03:42:41.60 --> 03:42:42.60
You think things might be.

2487
03:42:42.60 --> 03:42:44.04
It's called Drake shooting.

2488
03:42:44.04 --> 03:42:49.32
And the dude is like a he's a guy that's on Twitter who always brings up good

2489
03:42:49.32 --> 03:42:50.32
points.

2490
03:42:50.32 --> 03:42:52.44
He does his own personal research on stuff.

2491
03:42:52.44 --> 03:42:57.96
But he's got a weird handle that I can't remember what it is ever.

2492
03:42:57.96 --> 03:42:59.44
I recognize it in the heartbeat.

2493
03:42:59.44 --> 03:43:02.04
I know I can tell you all the kind of things.

2494
03:43:02.04 --> 03:43:05.12
So anyways, I apologize for not telling you that Drake shooting appreciate the info.

2495
03:43:05.12 --> 03:43:07.000
He's always got a good info.

2496
03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:10.52
But the psychological hitter with someone that's realized that that's what psychological

2497
03:43:10.52 --> 03:43:11.52
warfare is.

2498
03:43:11.52 --> 03:43:17.08
It's not some broad course on how to have more discipline in your life.

2499
03:43:17.08 --> 03:43:21.96
It's just a little bit of a hitter in case you need it.

2500
03:43:21.96 --> 03:43:28.72
So the psychological warfare, and if you need a visual hitter, you can go to flipsidecampus.com

2501
03:43:28.72 --> 03:43:32.20
to go to my or make it a bunch of really cool.

2502
03:43:32.20 --> 03:43:36.68
A bunch of really cool graphic images that you can hang up on your wall.

2503
03:43:36.68 --> 03:43:38.52
So you stay on the path no matter what.

2504
03:43:38.52 --> 03:43:39.52
Books.

2505
03:43:39.52 --> 03:43:40.36
Hey, look for this book right here.

2506
03:43:40.36 --> 03:43:41.68
The memory indoors.

2507
03:43:41.68 --> 03:43:42.68
Awesome book.

2508
03:43:42.68 --> 03:43:44.68
An honor to be able to read it.

2509
03:43:44.68 --> 03:43:47.72
Thank you to Rick or Rich who sent it to me.

2510
03:43:47.72 --> 03:43:51.24
And yes, we will keep up the work that we're doing here.

2511
03:43:51.24 --> 03:43:57.04
If you want to get this book, go to pilotspublishing.co.uk or go to facebook.com.

2512
03:43:57.04 --> 03:43:59.08
The memory indoors.

2513
03:43:59.08 --> 03:44:05.000
And if you also be helping out the regiment, the parachute regiment, charity.

2514
03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:08.12
On top of that, leadership strategy and tactics, everyone that's got it.

2515
03:44:08.12 --> 03:44:09.12
Thank you.

2516
03:44:09.12 --> 03:44:12.96
You're probably going to get copies of those for the people that you know, recommended.

2517
03:44:12.96 --> 03:44:14.36
Let's get your team on board.

2518
03:44:14.36 --> 03:44:15.88
I appreciate it.

2519
03:44:15.88 --> 03:44:23.36
Or your kid one, two and three, probably the best kids books that you can get right

2520
03:44:23.36 --> 03:44:24.84
now in my opinion.

2521
03:44:24.84 --> 03:44:26.64
I'm biased.

2522
03:44:26.64 --> 03:44:29.80
But I'm only biased because I read them.

2523
03:44:29.80 --> 03:44:33.48
And I think, man, the lessons in these books.

2524
03:44:33.48 --> 03:44:35.20
I wish I knew them.

2525
03:44:35.20 --> 03:44:36.40
I wish I knew them.

2526
03:44:36.40 --> 03:44:39.96
So warrior kid books one, two and three, way the warrior kid marks mission.

2527
03:44:39.96 --> 03:44:44.48
And where there's a will, Mikey in the dragons, if you got a little or kid.

2528
03:44:44.48 --> 03:44:47.84
Want to learn one of the most important things that you can learn as a kid is how to overcome

2529
03:44:47.84 --> 03:44:50.88
fear that book shows you how to overcome fear.

2530
03:44:50.88 --> 03:44:57.36
Discounted groups freedom, field manual, get it so that you can read two pages.

2531
03:44:57.36 --> 03:44:58.36
Read two pages.

2532
03:44:58.36 --> 03:45:03.28
Okay, you know, let's say we made up a pill that you could take this pill and you would

2533
03:45:03.28 --> 03:45:05.08
get a mind shift.

2534
03:45:05.08 --> 03:45:07.28
Like a positive way.

2535
03:45:07.28 --> 03:45:08.56
Like you would.

2536
03:45:08.56 --> 03:45:11.16
If you took this pill, you would increase your discipline.

2537
03:45:11.16 --> 03:45:15.44
And factually, okay, would that pill pill sell well?

2538
03:45:15.44 --> 03:45:16.44
Would people want it?

2539
03:45:16.44 --> 03:45:17.44
Yes.

2540
03:45:17.44 --> 03:45:18.44
Okay.

2541
03:45:18.44 --> 03:45:19.44
Read two pages of this book.

2542
03:45:19.44 --> 03:45:22.68
You're discipline will increase.

2543
03:45:22.68 --> 03:45:24.96
16 to 18% by the way.

2544
03:45:24.96 --> 03:45:25.96
Yeah.

2545
03:45:25.96 --> 03:45:26.96
Increase in discipline.

2546
03:45:26.96 --> 03:45:29.04
Well, read two pages.

2547
03:45:29.04 --> 03:45:36.20
Well, in the defense of the pill people, pill advocates, the whole purpose of a pill is

2548
03:45:36.20 --> 03:45:39.48
so you don't have to do any kind of work or read or do all this stuff.

2549
03:45:39.48 --> 03:45:43.52
Okay, so okay.

2550
03:45:43.52 --> 03:45:46.96
Two pages of this book is not an extended period of time.

2551
03:45:46.96 --> 03:45:49.20
You're finishing this in less than four minutes.

2552
03:45:49.20 --> 03:45:50.20
Oh, so right.

2553
03:45:50.20 --> 03:45:53.76
So this book essentially is the pill of books.

2554
03:45:53.76 --> 03:45:58.80
So you know, instead of like the encyclopedia set of books.

2555
03:45:58.80 --> 03:45:59.80
Okay.

2556
03:45:59.80 --> 03:46:00.80
We'll take it.

2557
03:46:00.80 --> 03:46:02.80
It's a rough lose analogy.

2558
03:46:02.80 --> 03:46:03.80
Not sure.

2559
03:46:03.80 --> 03:46:05.60
Not 100% I'll think of something.

2560
03:46:05.60 --> 03:46:06.60
Thank you through that one.

2561
03:46:06.60 --> 03:46:08.88
And then of course, we got extreme ownership of the Nicodemy leadership.

2562
03:46:08.88 --> 03:46:13.68
These are the foundational books about leadership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

2563
03:46:13.68 --> 03:46:16.56
We got echelon front, which is a leadership consultancy.

2564
03:46:16.56 --> 03:46:20.80
Look, if you have a business, if you have a team, if you have a company and you have

2565
03:46:20.80 --> 03:46:24.72
problems, every single problem that you have is a leadership problem.

2566
03:46:24.72 --> 03:46:29.84
I guarantee that every single problem that you have is a leadership problem.

2567
03:46:29.84 --> 03:46:34.64
And what we do at echelon front is we solve problems through leadership.

2568
03:46:34.64 --> 03:46:37.08
So go to echelonfront.com for details.

2569
03:46:37.08 --> 03:46:44.16
We got EF online, which is leadership, interactive leadership training online, it's EF online.com.

2570
03:46:44.16 --> 03:46:46.12
You can get the information.

2571
03:46:46.12 --> 03:46:48.000
You can get the repetitions.

2572
03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:54.44
You can get put in scenarios that will help you think through problems at EF online.

2573
03:46:54.44 --> 03:47:00.52
We also do little live webinars where we answer questions.

2574
03:47:00.52 --> 03:47:01.92
EF online.com.

2575
03:47:01.92 --> 03:47:12.80
We got the mustard coming up in Dallas, Texas, Orlando, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona.

2576
03:47:12.80 --> 03:47:15.60
Every event that we've done has sold out.

2577
03:47:15.60 --> 03:47:21.72
If you want to come, go to extremownership.com right now and register leadership 7R.

2578
03:47:21.72 --> 03:47:22.72
That's what we do there.

2579
03:47:22.72 --> 03:47:29.60
And of course, we've got EF Overwatch and EF Legion placement for military people that

2580
03:47:29.60 --> 03:47:32.60
understand extremownership.

2581
03:47:32.60 --> 03:47:34.36
Then understand the dichotomy of leadership.

2582
03:47:34.36 --> 03:47:36.80
EF Overwatch is for executive leadership inside companies.

2583
03:47:36.80 --> 03:47:40.40
EF Legion front line troops and front line leaders.

2584
03:47:40.40 --> 03:47:46.08
Go to EF Overwatch.com or EF Legion to get involved in that from either side, whether

2585
03:47:46.08 --> 03:47:47.08
you're a vet.

2586
03:47:47.08 --> 03:47:52.16
That wants to get into a civilian job or either civilian company that needs veterans to help

2587
03:47:52.16 --> 03:47:53.72
you lead and win.

2588
03:47:53.72 --> 03:47:56.24
Go to those websites and get that figured out.

2589
03:47:56.24 --> 03:48:03.92
EF, if you have not heard enough of my overly dramatic speech patterns and excessively long

2590
03:48:03.92 --> 03:48:06.56
pauses.

2591
03:48:06.56 --> 03:48:13.28
And you haven't heard enough of ECHOS ridiculous commentary about the heroic life of being

2592
03:48:13.28 --> 03:48:15.44
a balancer.

2593
03:48:15.44 --> 03:48:22.16
Then we are available on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on the old Fission

2594
03:48:22.16 --> 03:48:29.16
Blah, echo is that.

2595
03:48:29.16 --> 03:48:31.36
ECHOS and I am at Jock on the link in.

2596
03:48:31.36 --> 03:48:36.24
Thank you all for listening to the podcast and for giving this podcast to your support.

2597
03:48:36.24 --> 03:48:38.24
Thanks for spreading the word.

2598
03:48:38.24 --> 03:48:39.24
Thanks for telling your friends.

2599
03:48:39.24 --> 03:48:44.60
Thanks for getting some deaf core gear or some origin gear, all of which allows us to

2600
03:48:44.60 --> 03:48:46.24
do this podcast.

2601
03:48:46.24 --> 03:48:58.20
And of course, thanks to Reg Curtis for your service and sacrifice to keep us free.

2602
03:48:58.20 --> 03:49:02.12
And all the military members out there in uniform right now doing the same thing, keeping

2603
03:49:02.12 --> 03:49:07.92
the enemy at bay, and also to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics

2604
03:49:07.92 --> 03:49:11.60
and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers in Board of Patrol and Secret Service.

2605
03:49:11.60 --> 03:49:15.60
And all first responders.

2606
03:49:15.60 --> 03:49:17.04
Thank you for keeping us safe.

2607
03:49:17.04 --> 03:49:27.12
Every single day here at home and everyone else out there, remember what Reg Curtis taught

2608
03:49:27.12 --> 03:49:37.20
us to never give up even against overwhelming odds to never accept the feet to persevere

2609
03:49:37.20 --> 03:49:42.28
and endure until the end.

2610
03:49:42.28 --> 03:49:49.92
And then when you get tripped up or you get knocked down even then what you do is you do

2611
03:49:49.92 --> 03:49:55.52
the best you can.

2612
03:49:55.52 --> 03:49:58.68
Lesson learned.

2613
03:49:58.68 --> 03:49:59.68
Thank you.

2614
03:49:59.68 --> 03:50:08.88
Reg Curtis and we will be out there in your honor, getting after it.

2615
03:50:08.88 --> 03:50:12.20
And until next time, the ZECO.

2616
03:50:12.20 --> 03:50:14.20
And Jocco.

2617
03:50:14.20 --> 03:50:30.68
Ouch.
