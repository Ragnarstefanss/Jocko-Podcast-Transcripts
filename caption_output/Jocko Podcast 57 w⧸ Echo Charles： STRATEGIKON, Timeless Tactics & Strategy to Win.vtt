00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 57 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If the outcome of the battle is favorable, one should not be satisfied with merely driving the enemy back.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a mistake made by inexperienced leaders who do not know how to take advantage of an opportunity.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And who like to hear the saying, be victorious, but do not press your victory too hard.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
By not seizing the opportunity these people only cause themselves more trouble and place the ultimate results in doubt.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There can be no rest until the enemy is completely destroyed.

7
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If they seek refuge behind fortifications, apply pressure by direct force or by preventing them from getting more supplies for men and horses until they are annihilated.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Or else agree to a treaty to our advantage.

9
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
One should not slacken after driving them back just as short distance.

10
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:29.000
No or after so much hard work and the dangers of war should one jeopardize the success of the whole campaign because of lack of persistence.

11
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Good evening, echo. Good evening.

12
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now that's some direction there on how to pursue your enemy until they are completely destroyed.

13
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And that direction comes from a book called Strategic On.

14
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:12.000
A book that's normally accredited to a guy by the name of Flavius, Mauritius, Tiberius Augustus, or as he is more commonly called Maurice.

15
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And he was the emperor of Eastern Rome which is what we now call Byzantine in turn that wasn't even created until the 16th century.

16
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But Maurice was a Roman emperor who started his journey as a soldier, a general who campaigned successfully against the Persians, the Avars, the Lombards, all over Persia and the Balkans and basically around the Mediterranean.

17
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And his military experience served him well and this is the book that he's credited with.

18
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And in it he details a variety of the mindset of the famous Roman Legion and what he had evolved to, especially as they adopted the strengths of their enemies.

19
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And transitioned to using horses along with the use of lances and spears and bone arrow and swords. Again, all these things that you'd be using them all together.

20
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Much as we do today what we call combined arms, which is when we attack from the sea and from the air, we land forces and we drop bombs and we use artillery, we use everything.

21
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
To lock people, get people in the combined arms dilemma, my favorite ideas.

22
00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And something that combined arms dilemma, when you're getting attacked with all these different positions, it's very hard to contend with and obviously they were able to do this as they adapt the different their enemies, they adapted what they used but then they used them together.

23
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And so this book, Marys' book, Strategicon captures a lot of those ideas.

24
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I know it's no surprise but a lot of these ideas remain pertinent today.

25
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I know it's no surprise but not only on the battlefield but also in business and in life.

26
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And famous historian Charles O'Mon said about the Byzantine armies in courage, they were equal to their enemies in discipline, organization and armament, far superior.

27
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And we go into the interduction in this book a little bit here because there's some good information to know about.

28
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Here we go from the introduction of the book, they inherited the long tradition of Roman tactics and strategy with its emphasis on constant adaptation to the changing of war.

29
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It was largely this remarkable ability to adapt to new situations and new peoples which guarantee the Byzantine military success.

30
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Gotta be adaptable.

31
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The Byzantines more over like the Romans took warfare very seriously.

32
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The Byzantines war was an art to be practiced by professionals.

33
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:34.000
They possessed books on all aspects of warfare which were collected, copied over and over again and read.

34
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The fact that officers in the Byzantine army had to be able to read and write by itself sets it apart from other medieval armies.

35
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So obviously we do a lot of reading over here.

36
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
In this tradition right, this is what set them apart.

37
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
One of the things that set them apart was the fact that they read and they collected books on this subject.

38
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Byzantine generals carefully studied the habits and tactics of their enemies.

39
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Whereas Western knights found themselves at a loss when facing unknown foes.

40
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The Western European considered himself a good warrior if he could ride and wield his weapons well and if he showed no fear.

41
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Okay, so that's cool. You can ride and you can wield your weapons well and you show no fear.

42
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:32.000
For the Byzantine it was not superior strength or courage which won battles but after God's favor, thorough planning and intelligence.

43
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Nothing could be left to chance. Marise twice reminds his readers that the Byzantine generals should never have to admit.

44
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I did not expect that.

45
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Now let's get, so that's just from the introduction kind of getting into the book and now we'll go to the actual book.

46
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And I'm not going to go into the whole thing of who actually put these words on the paper again. It's credited to Marise.

47
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But did someone else possibly ride it and he blessed it? Did he tell someone to ride it?

48
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Did he have a ghost rider?

49
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I don't know.

50
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But he's the guy that's credited as having the brains behind it.

51
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Start off here.

52
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The training and drilling of the individual soldier.

53
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
He should be trained to shoot rapidly on foot, either in the Roman or the Persian manner.

54
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Speed is important in shaking the arrow loose and discharging it with force.

55
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This is essential and should be practiced while mounted.

56
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
In fact, even when the arrow is well-aimed, firing slowly as useless.

57
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.000
He should practice shooting rapidly on foot from a certain distance at a spear or some other target.

58
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
He should shoot also rapidly mounted on his horse at a run to the front, the rear, right and left.

59
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
He should practice leaping onto the horse.

60
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
On horseback at a run, he should fire one or two or his rap arrows rapidly and put the string, the strong bow in its case.

61
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
If it is wide enough or in the half case designed for this purpose, and then he should grab the spear which he has been carrying on his back.

62
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
With the strong bow in its case, he should hold the spear in his hand and quickly replace it on his back and grab the bow.

63
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It is a good idea for soldiers to practice all this while mounted on the march in their own country.

64
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
For such exercises, do not interfere with marching and do not wear out the horses.

65
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The reason I had to put this in here is because this is very much what we do in the SEAL teams.

66
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You are shooting off hand, which means you are shooting with your weak hand.

67
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We are reloading magazines with only one hand.

68
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You have to put the weapon between your legs and pull the mags.

69
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You are shooting all the stuff you are shooting while you are running.

70
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You are shooting behind the vehicle.

71
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You are shooting from outside of the vehicle.

72
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You are doing all these things all these different ways all the time.

73
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Because the better you get in all these strings, the better you are performing these strings.

74
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
You can apply this to any abysion I have talked about this before.

75
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
When you are dealing with business, you want to train your people to handle these weird situations.

76
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Be a bad customer.

77
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You know, pretend to be a bad person.

78
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
If you have leaders that you are training, be a horrible employee.

79
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Be that person.

80
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Put them to the test.

81
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
How are they going to handle employee that flies off the handle?

82
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
How are they going to play?

83
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Handle employee that doesn't fly off the handle and get all verbal, but just goes cold.

84
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
What are you going to do now?

85
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
How are you going to handle this person?

86
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Remember you guys are doing at the master.

87
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You guys are doing that role playing thing real quick.

88
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It was real quick too.

89
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
When I caught Lay off guard, you are going to do this.

90
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Oh yeah, when you presented it a little.

91
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But man, that was such a good point though because you go through one situation.

92
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I don't have time for whatever.

93
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Whatever your is going.

94
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Then you are like, okay, and you get to put yourself through a potential situation.

95
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And then at the end of it, you said, okay, look, we just went through that and we did it.

96
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And maybe you there was problems maybe not.

97
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But now you're familiar with it.

98
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Kind of like the lights are on now.

99
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
You're not going live into a dark room, not knowing.

100
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You're doing exactly what Marie said to do here, which is the most important thing is intelligence.

101
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So it's combining what he's saying.

102
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Right?

103
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The more you prepare for that particular situation that Lay off and I did that little role play on.

104
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He acted like he was a company commander that didn't have time for me.

105
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Yeah.

106
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And he took it to the next level and said, I don't have time for you because I got guys in combat right now.

107
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I got troops in contact, which is that when you got troops in contact, that's where everyone's going to focus on that.

108
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So I'm in there playing this young seal officer going, excuse me, captain, hey,

109
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I'd like to talk to you about an operation.

110
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We're going to do in your area of operation tonight.

111
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Lay off says, hey, I'm busy.

112
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I got troops in contact.

113
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Leave me alone.

114
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And I was kind of taking it back and I said, sir, you know what?

115
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Can you just tell me where your ops officers and I'll go talk to him?

116
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Yeah.

117
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And that was it?

118
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I overcame it because what else are you going to do?

119
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But it took me a second ahead of think on my feet if that ever happened again.

120
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I wouldn't have to think on my feet.

121
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Right?

122
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The answer.

123
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And you went through like, if you were to do that in a real situation and you stumbled,

124
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you didn't know what to do.

125
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah.

126
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
That's a web huge deal.

127
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
It's looking bad.

128
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
You're not giving any confidence.

129
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
You're saying, hey, I want to come into your area of operations and execute a mission tonight.

130
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And I can't even put a sentence together.

131
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Yeah.

132
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Yeah.

133
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
That's why we heard sports case scenarios.

134
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
That's why you practice shooting on the horse off the horse, putting your bow away, pulling

135
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
it back out, throwing your spear, get that's what you do.

136
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yeah.

137
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
It's crazy how even going through once.

138
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
One time.

139
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
That much.

140
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Well, when I work with companies, I'll do role play and I'll tell them watch what happens

141
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
in three times, three iterations.

142
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They get that much better.

143
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
They'll go from totally snumbling and not being able to handle a bad employee to where the third

144
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
time they got it.

145
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Yeah.

146
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
That's all it takes.

147
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
There's the same thing we put guys through in the in the sealed teams, we've got it through

148
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
really hard training scenarios.

149
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And they would blow it and I'd kill all this is training.

150
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I'd kill all the good guys, right?

151
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Then I'll begin here with paintball, your dead, your dead.

152
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Next time.

153
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I say, okay, here's the mistake you may.

154
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Let's look at what would you do?

155
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Step back.

156
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
What would you do different?

157
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Oh, man.

158
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I didn't see that.

159
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I got, you know, I got drawn to the situation.

160
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I should, okay.

161
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So let's do it again.

162
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
They're going to be 50% better the next time.

163
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The next the time after that, we can't even catch them anymore.

164
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Because they got it.

165
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
It's crazy preparation.

166
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
All right.

167
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I'm going back to the book.

168
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Another thing that Marie says in actual combat,

169
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
nobody can properly supervise the entire battle.

170
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Since the line is spread out so far,

171
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and some can desert from their bandits and bandits.

172
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
There's two meanings of the word bandits.

173
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
One is a flag.

174
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Like this is our flag.

175
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But then it's also a group of about 300 troops.

176
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So what he's saying is that people can desert

177
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
back to the book unnoticed and give all others

178
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
an excuse to retreat.

179
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
If they do retreat, there's no way of turning back

180
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
or of checking the flight for nobody is able to get them back

181
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
since as we said, the whole army is routed.

182
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So this is why we need a little bit of decentralized command,

183
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
right?

184
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Because he's saying you're no one can.

185
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
You can't keep track of the whole battle.

186
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
How many people can you keep track of turning battle?

187
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Four?

188
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Maybe five?

189
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
These guys are going in a battle with thousands.

190
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
You can't keep track of them all.

191
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So one of the things that they do, and this is sort of a,

192
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
it's sort of a cover and move scenario.

193
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So the way they set up, they set up two lines.

194
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Said to just one line, they set up two lines.

195
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Back to the book.

196
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And there should be two lines.

197
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
One of them, a support.

198
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The troops in the front line will fight more eagerly,

199
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
knowing that their rear is protected by the second line,

200
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and that their flanks by the flank guards.

201
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So even if you just know you're covered,

202
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
man, you're going to fight harder, because you don't have to worry about what else is going on.

203
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
That's why we do cover move.

204
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Second, a man in the first line is not as likely to run away

205
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
when he knows there are many other soldiers

206
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
our station to his rear.

207
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
That is in his second, in the second line,

208
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and we'll see anyone discerting his posts.

209
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
See, there's a little, it's like logical.

210
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
They made, I'm not going to run, because the guys are right behind me.

211
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
They're going to know.

212
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
In combat, this can be extremely important.

213
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Supposing that the first line retreats or is pushed back,

214
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
then the second line is there, a support,

215
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and as a place of refuge.

216
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So you got to back each other up, cover move.

217
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Next one.

218
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
A small army should not prepare

219
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
to face an organized and more numerous foe in open battle,

220
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
except in case of necessity.

221
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Boom.

222
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Don't go and fight against a bigger, better opponent with more people.

223
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Don't fight against them.

224
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Back to the book, if the necessity does arise,

225
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
do not mass all your troops in front.

226
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And even if the enemy number is superior, direct your operations

227
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
against his rear or his flank.

228
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
For his dangerous and uncertain and all conditions,

229
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and against any people to engage purely frontal combat.

230
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Even if the enemy station is a smaller number of troops up front.

231
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So this is, we talk about this over and over again.

232
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Don't attack the front.

233
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Don't attack the hardened position.

234
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Next, squads should be made up of old and young men in proportion.

235
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Otherwise, the older men, if formed by themselves, maybe weak.

236
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And the younger inexperienced men may turn out disorganized.

237
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So this is, this is obviously important,

238
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
but sometimes people have a tendency to want to build a super team.

239
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Right?

240
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I'm going to take all these guys, all the best guys.

241
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
You want to make your team as even as possible.

242
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
This is a classic example.

243
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Just take all the old senior guys who have all the experience.

244
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
But they might not be in the best physical condition.

245
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I mean, you take a single putton.

246
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
You take a 43 year old seal.

247
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Now there's some studs out there.

248
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Don't get me wrong.

249
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But you compare them to a kid that's 24.

250
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That's on fire.

251
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You tell that kid to go climb a ladder, jump up a building.

252
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
He's going to do it.

253
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
They're beasts.

254
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
So you want to have both those elements in your team.

255
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And it's the same thing in a bigger organization or a business organization.

256
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Spread out the knowledge and spread out the enthusiasm.

257
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Is that, does that have to do with like,

258
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Are you saying like a senior guy?

259
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
He might have a bunch of knowledge.

260
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Versus, you know, a younger guy.

261
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
He'll have a lot of athleticism and physical capability or the less world.

262
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It could be enthusiasm, right?

263
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
It could be like, hey, I'm just going to grind it.

264
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Hungry young guy.

265
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I'm going to head home.

266
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
You take care of this.

267
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I got it boss.

268
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Let's do this.

269
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Is that also because let's say a young guy who has enthusiasm.

270
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And if you if you mix it up with instead of all enthusiastic people.

271
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
You have older guys.

272
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
They can teach the knowledge to the guy and they can.

273
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Yes, we're going to make our team stronger.

274
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Okay.

275
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Yeah.

276
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Next one, various tactics and drills.

277
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Constant drill is of the greatest value to the soldier.

278
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Each formation drill should be identified in a special way so that the soldiers who are trained in these maneuvers may recognize the differences and not be puzzled by them.

279
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I can't even tell you how much you do what we call in the seal teams that do in the Marine Corps of the do in the Army.

280
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
A immediate action drills.

281
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So it's a contact drill.

282
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
When something goes wrong, how you're going to maneuver your troops on the battlefield.

283
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And the more you do that, the better you're going to get at it.

284
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And the better you get at it, the better you're going to perform in combat.

285
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Period in the story.

286
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Is that like a fire drill?

287
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And yeah, it's like a fire drill in a school.

288
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
It's like a fire drill.

289
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It's like when you drill to jitter.

290
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
When you say, hey, I'm going to practice this escape.

291
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
You know, we do that a lot.

292
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
The defacle ever makes us do that all the time is okay, let the guy basically put you in a triangle.

293
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Or Dean will make you go in triangle danger or armlock danger, whatever.

294
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So then you're going to drill how you can get out of that.

295
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And that way when you're rolling live, it's an instinct.

296
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And it's the same thing with the situation with your military unit.

297
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
As soon as you make that simple call, flank, punch right, move left, whatever the peel left, whatever that call that you're going to make.

298
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Everybody knows what to do. And it provides instant organization and focus and direction to everybody.

299
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Everybody, it's weird.

300
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
You know, there's certain calls in the seal team, certain maneuvers that everybody knows.

301
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
If you make one of those calls, like everyone knows it every single person in the entire seal community knows exactly.

302
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Same thing in the Marine Corps, that would be there's certain standard operating procedures that you learn in Marine Corps boot camp.

303
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:23.000
If you say it to a hundred different Marines that have been assembled for the first time ever in their lives, you say one of these commands, they're all going to get on it.

304
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good.

305
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
It's awesome.

306
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000
All right, going back to the book strategy, the points which the general must consider before the day of battle.

307
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
A ship cannot cross the sea without a hen'sman.

308
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Nor can one defeat an enemy without strategy in tactics.

309
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000
With these and the aid of God, it is possible to overcome not only an enemy force of equal strength, but even one greatly superior in numbers.

310
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000
For it is not true as some inexperienced people believe that wars are decided by courage and number of troops.

311
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
But along with God's favor, by tactics and general ship.

312
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And our concern should be with these rather than wasting our time mobilizing large numbers of men.

313
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
The leader must take advantage of favorable times and places in fighting against the enemy.

314
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
First, he must guard against hostile attacks which can injure our men.

315
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And then he must attempt to launch the same against the enemy.

316
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Above all, he must look for enemy ambushes, sending out frequent and far-ranging patrols and all directions in the area around the battlefield.

317
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
He must avoid disordered and uncoordinated pursuits.

318
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Now this is the thing about what we start this whole thing off.

319
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
You get the advantage, you get the upper hand and battle, go finish him.

320
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Keep pursuing them until all the enemy is completely destroyed.

321
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
But he's saying this right here.

322
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
He must avoid disordered and uncoordinated pursuits.

323
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Now, my first deployment to Iraq, there's a couple of times we got ambushed.

324
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
We're either vehicles, got ambushed.

325
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And the urge is stop the vehicles.

326
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Let's go get these guys.

327
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And we didn't do that.

328
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
On these particular missions, we were going, we had a private, some kind of priority target.

329
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
We were going after a bad guy somewhere.

330
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
We make it through the ambush.

331
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
If all of a sudden I say, okay, stop.

332
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
We're going to go get these guys.

333
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
We're going to ego thing.

334
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
That would basically be an ego thing.

335
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Stop the vehicles.

336
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
We're going to go get these guys.

337
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Not a good call.

338
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
We made it through the ambush.

339
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
We're good.

340
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
We have a mission to accomplish.

341
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Let's report this up to Janik.

342
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Man, maybe they can get some aircraft overhead or something like that.

343
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
But we're not going to just go into this disorganized pursuit of an enemy.

344
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
That actually has the upper hand because we made it through that vessel.

345
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
What else do they have prepared for us?

346
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Because I can guarantee they want you to stop.

347
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
So you need to think before you just get overly aggressive.

348
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Back to the book, we would not allow the general to take part personally in raids or other reckless attacks.

349
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
These should be entrusted to other competent officers.

350
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
For if one of the subordinate officers, blunders or fails, the situation may be quickly straightened out.

351
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
But if the leader of the whole army fails, this fall can open the way to complete disorder.

352
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:42.000
The general is wise who before entering into war carefully studies the enemy and can guard against his strong points and take advantage of his weaknesses.

353
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
obvious stuff that we talk about every single day.

354
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Back to the book, warfare is like hunting.

355
00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Wild animals are taken by scouting, by nets, by lying in weight, by stalking, by circling around, and by other strategies rather than by sheer force.

356
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
In waging war, we should proceed in the same way.

357
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Whether the enemy be many or few, to try to simply overpower the enemy in the open, hand the hand and face to face,

358
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
even though you might appear to win, is an enterprise which is very risky and can result in serious harm.

359
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Apart from extreme emergency, it is ridiculous to try and gain a victory which is so costly and only brings empty glory.

360
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We're talking about flanking.

361
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
We're talking about staking, always making sure the cards are stacked in your favor.

362
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
That's what we're talking about here.

363
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Then it's again, it applies in life, it applies in the present jujitsu.

364
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
We had a little battle like that today.

365
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
You were, I was actually, did you see me smiling?

366
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I was kind of laughing because you were boom, coming to me, coming to me, coming to me, I was,

367
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I was kind of laughing because I was thinking about this podcast and I was thinking, hey,

368
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
he's going head to head with me face to face and I'm gonna, I'm gonna fight him.

369
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
But that's the way it works.

370
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Yeah, apparently.

371
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
All right, back to the book.

372
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
On the actual day of the battle, the general should not take on too many tasks.

373
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
He might exert himself too much, become worn out and overlook some really essential matters.

374
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Now that to me is number one, you got it, this hatch and number two, you don't want to be in the weeds.

375
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
If you're trying to get everything you're done yourself, you're gonna overlook some really essential matters.

376
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Yeah.

377
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
He should not look downcast or worried but should ride gently along the lines and encourage all troops.

378
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
He should not himself join in the actual fighting.

379
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
This is not the role of the general but of the soldier.

380
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
After making all the proper arrangements, he should station himself on a suitable spot from which he can observe,

381
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
which troops are exerting themselves and which might be slackening.

382
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.000
When needed, he should be ready to send assistance to a unit in trouble by making use of his reserves.

383
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
That is the flank and rear guards.

384
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
So you gotta stay detached and we're talking the general here.

385
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
This is the general.

386
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
This is the CEO.

387
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Right? This is the president of a company.

388
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Not getting so far into the weeds that you just don't see what's happening.

389
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And you can't, if you're in the weeds fighting, who's gonna be watching to see that that area is slackening?

390
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Who's gonna be able to direct the rear guard to help out?

391
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Who's gonna send the reinforcements? Answer is nobody.

392
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
You're not doing your job.

393
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Here's another one.

394
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Even though the general decides against a pitched battle, he should still make preparations for one.

395
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Gotta be ready.

396
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Some of you asked me actually on Twitter a couple of days ago.

397
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Are you worried about another 9-11 in America?

398
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
And I said, I'm not worried.

399
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I'm prepared.

400
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And that's what this is saying.

401
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Even though you don't want to do a pitch battle?

402
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I'm not gonna meet them.

403
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Hey, that's too much of a frontal attack.

404
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I'm not gonna do that. You better be ready for one.

405
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
That might be the only choice.

406
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
You might get attacked or you gotta always be ready.

407
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Back to the book. He should make it appear that he plans on one.

408
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
And convey the impression to all those troops that he will definitely attack the enemy.

409
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
This will cause trouble for the enemy when it comes to their knowledge.

410
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So you gotta prepare, be prepared.

411
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
No slack.

412
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Another one here.

413
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
This is about infantry drill movements.

414
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
We're going back to training here.

415
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
The Harold commands, silence.

416
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Observe orders.

417
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Do not worry.

418
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Keep your position. Follow the standard.

419
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Do not leave the standard and pursue the enemy.

420
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
The troops then advance at a steady pace and in silence.

421
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Without anyone even whispering.

422
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
They should become accustomed to these movements.

423
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
So that is a spoken command, a nod or some other signal.

424
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
They march or halt, reduce or divide the depth of the files.

425
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
March steadily in close order for a good distance.

426
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Or various kind of terrain.

427
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Clothes are tight in the ranks and depth.

428
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And with march, engage in mock battle.

429
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Sometimes using staffs and sometimes naked swords.

430
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So this is a really important one.

431
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
This reminds me very much of something that we used to do.

432
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
So we say, and you're going to do a drill.

433
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And you're not allowed to talk.

434
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
You have to be completely silent.

435
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And this is something we absolutely used to drill in this hilltimes.

436
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Where you're not allowed to talk.

437
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And we would actually sometimes take radios away.

438
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
So hey, you can.

439
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
We turn off everyone.

440
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Turn off your radios.

441
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
So you just have to figure this out.

442
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And if you run like that all the time,

443
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
eventually everybody learns how to,

444
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
it makes everyone more proactive.

445
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Because you know you're not going to hear a command.

446
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
You know the boss isn't going to get the radio and say,

447
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
you're going to have to be a blank left.

448
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
You're not coming because that's so you have to learn to look around.

449
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
You have to learn to sense what's going to happen.

450
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And it makes everybody better at what they're doing.

451
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And I'll tell you, you know, I've talked about this before.

452
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
We didn't in my task.

453
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
You know, I might have to tune.

454
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
We didn't talk on the radio.

455
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
We didn't.

456
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
We would barely talk on the radio.

457
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
If I came on the radio and said something,

458
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
it was like, everybody was,

459
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
oh, the joc would just talk to,

460
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
you know, life would say to me,

461
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
joc on moving to building 48.

462
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
That's a do it.

463
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
They'd go, they wouldn't eat.

464
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
He'd get Roger and he'd go.

465
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
They wouldn't say anything else.

466
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And that was because when we were in training,

467
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
we would do these drills.

468
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Or we wouldn't talk.

469
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
You're not allowed to talk.

470
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
You're allowed to make a head nod.

471
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
You're allowed to give somebody a visual signal.

472
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
But you're not allowed to come on the radio and you're not allowed to talk.

473
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And that makes you so good.

474
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
What it does is it makes your verbal,

475
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
your non-verbal communication skills on point.

476
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
It was cool when I went to Austria,

477
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
you can't even go to school.

478
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
So it offers to campus school.

479
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
They got to do weird things that they do to you.

480
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And I'll give you a couple examples.

481
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
One of them is you're not allowed to look at your food when you're eating.

482
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
So you have to stare straight ahead.

483
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And this doesn't sound like a big deal.

484
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Because you think yourself while just looking at my food.

485
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
All right.

486
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
If you look at your food,

487
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
everybody can see in the drone structures.

488
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
You'll know what you're looking at your food.

489
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
So what you have to do is you have to just look straight ahead.

490
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
You're looking straight ahead across the table.

491
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.96
stabbing your fork into the tray of food that you have in front of you. And it's, you know,

492
00:30:10.96 --> 00:30:15.92
it's a little hard to eat. And then over time, you start to be able to utilize your peripheral

493
00:30:15.92 --> 00:30:21.28
vision a little bit more so that you can see it without looking at it. That's one. The other one,

494
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:25.52
I think I've talked about this. You have to scream everything that you say. Yeah. Right. There's,

495
00:30:25.52 --> 00:30:29.76
so there's all these little things that they make you do. Go ballistic. Go ballistic at all times,

496
00:30:29.76 --> 00:30:35.04
right? I've told that story before. But when it was pretty cool when, when my drone structure

497
00:30:35.04 --> 00:30:41.36
gunnery sergeant Marine Corps, awesome guy, when when we got done, you know, he was explaining

498
00:30:41.36 --> 00:30:48.16
why we did all this stuff. And the one about not looking at your food comes from, it does come from

499
00:30:48.16 --> 00:30:55.76
improving your peripheral vision. Because the way the officer cannon school was originally set up was

500
00:30:55.76 --> 00:31:01.84
for pilots, potential Navy pilots. So guess what, you got to be able to see your instruments

501
00:31:01.84 --> 00:31:07.76
down below you while you're looking around and scanning for enemy aircraft. And so this is what

502
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:13.76
it does. It allows you to improve. Well, this is the same thing. When, when you build that muscle memory

503
00:31:13.76 --> 00:31:18.72
of hey, I'm not going to talk and I need to look around and I need to be permanently proactive

504
00:31:18.72 --> 00:31:25.04
and make sure that I'm not going to hear anything. So as a junior guy, I'm not going to hear anything.

505
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:30.40
I have to look around. I have to make a decision. I have to absorb and figure out what's happening.

506
00:31:30.40 --> 00:31:36.48
That is unbelievably good. So anybody that works in an environment, you know, police officers,

507
00:31:36.48 --> 00:31:41.68
obviously military, do these silent drills, do them. It'll make you that much better. It was

508
00:31:41.68 --> 00:31:47.76
one of us. I was relaying the mats at our gym the other day. And Andy was there. Big Andy,

509
00:31:47.76 --> 00:31:53.28
by the way, just got us back by the way. Yeah, we relayed the mats and, you know, he's just a,

510
00:31:53.28 --> 00:31:58.000
we're just working and we didn't say a word to each other for five hours. We're there. We're just

511
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.04
picking up stuff and doing stuff and, you know, he's, you know, an iron worker by trade. And so

512
00:32:03.04 --> 00:32:06.88
he's just guy that, you know, just he sees me doing something. He's the, I see him doing something.

513
00:32:06.88 --> 00:32:11.92
So what is non-verbal communication? Just non-verbal communication. Work on it. It's awesome.

514
00:32:13.92 --> 00:32:22.72
All right. So this next section is really kind of where I was heading with all this. This is

515
00:32:22.72 --> 00:32:29.92
the, these are maksoms, right? General instructions and maksoms. And when we do books that are

516
00:32:29.92 --> 00:32:35.92
maksoms, it makes my job really easy. Because I'm not trying to pull stuff out. It's there. They

517
00:32:35.92 --> 00:32:39.52
are pulled out for you. You know, we didn't know, pull the ins maksoms. There's nothing to pull out.

518
00:32:39.52 --> 00:32:44.32
Read the maksoms. Boom. Suns you are to war. Oh, there's nothing to pull out. Read the maksoms.

519
00:32:45.04 --> 00:32:50.72
And that's what this rolls into right here. Different, and in one of the things I talk about this

520
00:32:50.72 --> 00:32:56.24
in GJ2, I talk about this in anything. So these maksoms you're going to see. These are familiar.

521
00:32:57.12 --> 00:33:01.44
So why would we go film again? Why do we need to hear them again? I'll tell you the reason why we

522
00:33:01.44 --> 00:33:08.08
need to hear them again. Because just like GJ2, you are going to see these things from a slightly

523
00:33:08.08 --> 00:33:14.48
different angle every single time. Just like in combat, you're going to enter a million rooms

524
00:33:14.48 --> 00:33:20.000
as an assaulter on an assault team. You're going to enter a million different rooms. And there's a

525
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.48
basic structure at all. But no two rooms are like no two rooms are exactly like. And the more that

526
00:33:26.48 --> 00:33:30.96
you enter and the more different angles you see, the better you get at handling them. Just like in

527
00:33:30.96 --> 00:33:36.08
GJ2, when you go against different body types, the better you get at your arm locks. When you do

528
00:33:36.08 --> 00:33:40.72
arm lock from the bottom, from the top, from the side, you get better at those arm locks. In the business

529
00:33:40.72 --> 00:33:46.96
world, the more deals that you see and you understand how they unfold, the better you're going to

530
00:33:46.96 --> 00:33:51.84
get with construction industry, the more walls you build, there are a little bit different, little

531
00:33:51.84 --> 00:33:58.64
things come out a little bit different. So the more you see them, the more you hear them from slightly

532
00:33:58.64 --> 00:34:04.40
different angles, the more adapt you are utilizing them. That's why I love when I see these

533
00:34:04.40 --> 00:34:17.92
maximums. So here we go. General instructions for the commander. In carrying out very critical operations,

534
00:34:17.92 --> 00:34:26.24
the general ought not set himself apart as though such labor was beneath him. But he should begin the

535
00:34:26.24 --> 00:34:33.52
work and toil along with his troops as much as possible. Such behavior will lead the soldier to be

536
00:34:33.52 --> 00:34:40.48
more submissive to his officers, even if only out of shame and he will accomplish more. So even though

537
00:34:40.48 --> 00:34:45.12
you know earlier say, hey, general, don't don't get in the weeds. But if there's work to do,

538
00:34:45.12 --> 00:34:53.68
do to work, show them you're doing the work. Next, when certain offenses are common among the

539
00:34:53.68 --> 00:34:59.28
soldiers, moderation is called for. Do not judge and punish all indiscriminately.

540
00:34:59.28 --> 00:35:06.000
Wide spread resentment might draw them all together and discipline would become even worse.

541
00:35:07.04 --> 00:35:14.24
It is wiser to punish just a few of the ring leaders. So you can talk about the harshness of the

542
00:35:14.24 --> 00:35:21.60
Roman Legion. But here you say and look, dial that back a little bit. Dial that back a little bit.

543
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:27.36
If the offenses are common among the soldiers. So this is also a little bit of

544
00:35:27.36 --> 00:35:33.20
life, Babin. It's not what you preach to. What you tolerate? If you're tolerating it, then you can't

545
00:35:33.20 --> 00:35:37.84
just also drop the hammer because you're going to look inconsistent. If you're not going to

546
00:35:37.84 --> 00:35:41.92
tolerate it, don't tolerate it. But if you do, and it's a common offense, don't all of a sudden fly

547
00:35:41.92 --> 00:35:51.28
off the handle. In consistent. Next, the general's way of life should be plain and simple like

548
00:35:51.28 --> 00:35:58.000
that of his soldiers. He should display a fatherly affection toward them. He should give orders in a mild

549
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.08
manner. And he should always make sure to give advice and to discuss essential matters with them in person.

550
00:36:05.60 --> 00:36:09.60
So we heard this from Pat. Well, here are this from everybody. But Pat and said that exactly

551
00:36:09.60 --> 00:36:13.76
everything. You need to do, you need to live like your soldiers. We hear that all the time.

552
00:36:13.76 --> 00:36:18.96
Take winners and everybody says this. Don't, don't go up in the, don't go up in the ivory tower.

553
00:36:18.96 --> 00:36:26.96
Don't do it. Boss, man. It's like the boss who gets the huge corner. Everyone has cubicles.

554
00:36:26.96 --> 00:36:32.88
But it's a huge, gold plated stuff. Yeah. The way the massage chair in the

555
00:36:32.88 --> 00:36:37.92
arms. Yeah. Yeah. Don't disturb me. Yeah. Yeah. For the 12 minutes. I'm running the 12

556
00:36:37.92 --> 00:36:44.64
minute in the size chair session. His concerns ought to be with their safety, their food,

557
00:36:44.64 --> 00:36:49.04
and their regular pay. Without these, it is impossible to maintain discipline in an army.

558
00:36:50.80 --> 00:36:55.12
By being just imponishing offenders, he should instill fear.

559
00:36:56.48 --> 00:37:02.40
At the very first sign of a disciplinary problem, he should take action to end it and not delay

560
00:37:02.40 --> 00:37:07.76
dealing with it until it grows or becomes more serious. The general's successful when his man

561
00:37:07.76 --> 00:37:16.72
regard him as unshakable and just. He should also see that civilians are left unharmed. Boom.

562
00:37:16.72 --> 00:37:22.24
So when you got the problem, when you see the problem, get the problem solved. Don't wait. It's not

563
00:37:22.24 --> 00:37:28.32
going to go away. It's not going to get, not going to get better on its own. Next, he should be

564
00:37:28.32 --> 00:37:38.64
temperant in his way of life and vigilant. Pretty straightforward. It's a maximum. Next, it is essential

565
00:37:38.64 --> 00:37:45.44
to be cautious and take your time in making plans and once you have come to a decision to carry

566
00:37:45.44 --> 00:37:54.56
it out right away without any hesitation. Timidity, after all, is not caution, but the invention

567
00:37:54.56 --> 00:38:00.88
of wickedness. When you're going to go, go. Go. Once you make your decision, go.

568
00:38:00.88 --> 00:38:09.44
That a default aggressive. That is a default aggressive thing. Yes. I healthy mind is not unduly

569
00:38:09.44 --> 00:38:17.36
related by success or overly depressed when things are not going well. A lot of these speak for

570
00:38:17.36 --> 00:38:25.52
themselves. That's one of them. You got to be mineral erode, maintain. Don't get emotional.

571
00:38:25.52 --> 00:38:29.28
Not late either we won. Not to prove you. No.

572
00:38:30.48 --> 00:38:38.24
Maintain. Next, it is safer and more advantageous to overcome the enemy by planning in general

573
00:38:38.24 --> 00:38:43.76
ship than my shear force. In the one case, results are achieved without loss to oneself,

574
00:38:43.76 --> 00:38:54.24
while the other some price has to be paid. Next, it is very important to spread rumors among

575
00:38:54.24 --> 00:38:59.68
the enemy that you are planning to do one thing and then go do something else. Your plans about

576
00:38:59.68 --> 00:39:05.76
major operations should not be known to many, but just a few, and those very close to you.

577
00:39:05.76 --> 00:39:15.52
Next, alarming rumors or traps of treachery, whether on the part of the enemy or on our own,

578
00:39:15.52 --> 00:39:21.04
not being neglected or action deferred, but steps should be taken to deal with them and put a

579
00:39:21.04 --> 00:39:27.28
shop to stop to them before they become realities. Should you start hearing rumors? Smash them.

580
00:39:29.12 --> 00:39:34.000
That's one thing I see in companies. Companies, this is a problem that businesses have.

581
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.84
I mean, it happens in the multitudes, but businesses have this problem where they

582
00:39:39.20 --> 00:39:48.16
they let rumors grow. They let messaging get formed by the uninformed. That's not what you want

583
00:39:48.16 --> 00:39:52.000
to do. If you're in charge of a business and something bad is going to happen,

584
00:39:53.12 --> 00:39:58.000
explain it to everyone. Don't let the people explain it themselves because the idea that they're

585
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.44
going to come up with is going to be the worst case scenario possible to take a magic.

586
00:40:01.44 --> 00:40:08.72
So proactive communications, so people know what is happening. Don't let them define their own

587
00:40:09.68 --> 00:40:14.08
messaging and their own rumors stop them by giving them the information.

588
00:40:17.12 --> 00:40:22.32
Next, the enemy should be deceived by false reports of our plans,

589
00:40:23.76 --> 00:40:26.96
brought to them by deserters from us.

590
00:40:26.96 --> 00:40:32.96
Yes. So you got people that you think might leave you cool, give them some bad intel.

591
00:40:37.44 --> 00:40:45.84
Courage should be roused in our troops by fabricating report of a victory over the enemy

592
00:40:45.84 --> 00:40:53.28
one by our men someplace else. Now, this is a controversial in my mind. Right. So what they're saying

593
00:40:53.28 --> 00:40:57.28
is, hey, you should make up some stories about how well so-and-so is doing in another area.

594
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.28
You've got to think about what you're doing there. And of course, this day and age,

595
00:41:03.28 --> 00:41:07.60
that's hard to do. We have just open communications. We have texting. We have phones. We have all

596
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:11.12
this stuff. So it's you'd be a hard press to verify that. But one of the things that I

597
00:41:11.12 --> 00:41:16.40
thought about when I read that where I disagree with this is in mixed martial arts, for instance,

598
00:41:16.40 --> 00:41:23.60
guy loses around, you know, round one. The guy goes out and doesn't do a good job.

599
00:41:23.60 --> 00:41:27.12
Yeah. His losing the round comes back to his corner. What does his corner tone?

600
00:41:27.12 --> 00:41:31.04
You're doing great. Keep it going. That's the wrong worst thing you can do.

601
00:41:31.84 --> 00:41:36.000
Worst thing you can do is like, like, because he'll keep it up. You're going to keep it up.

602
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.48
All right. Yeah. You need to say, look, you're losing. In any time it's close, you've got to

603
00:41:40.48 --> 00:41:43.84
assume that the other guy won. Any round that's even remotely close, you've got to assume

604
00:41:43.84 --> 00:41:49.36
the other guy got that round. Yeah. So don't do this. Don't say great round. Keep it going. No.

605
00:41:50.16 --> 00:41:55.20
There's not a single MMM fighter that I've ever worked with that when you tell him great round

606
00:41:55.20 --> 00:42:01.68
you're winning steps it up. I'd never seen it. I've never heard it. Never seen it. Never heard it.

607
00:42:01.68 --> 00:42:06.000
And if you watch the UFC because they got those corner cams now. Oh, yeah. And I have the

608
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.28
internet thing where I can pick who I'm going to listen to and I can rewatch it. You can hear what

609
00:42:09.28 --> 00:42:14.80
the corners are saying to you. Check it out. Go and look at a fighter who's corner tells them they're

610
00:42:14.80 --> 00:42:18.16
doing a great job and tell me, find me an example of where a guy here is he's doing a great

611
00:42:18.16 --> 00:42:23.12
job and then he steps it up or even harder. It doesn't happen. Everybody goes into cruise mode.

612
00:42:23.12 --> 00:42:26.80
Right. Yeah. And if they're losing, guess what that cruise mode? That gets him destroyed.

613
00:42:28.48 --> 00:42:32.24
So be careful with that one. Marie's got a disagree with you all that one.

614
00:42:32.24 --> 00:42:39.60
Back to the book news about reverses suffered by us should be kept secret and

615
00:42:39.60 --> 00:42:43.04
report stating just the opposite should be circulated about okay. So now we're talking about

616
00:42:43.04 --> 00:42:47.52
controlling the messaging but we're talking about lying and in this day and age doesn't work.

617
00:42:47.52 --> 00:42:51.12
You get it. It doesn't not gonna work for you. You can't say don't worry about it. It was like

618
00:42:51.12 --> 00:42:57.76
remember Baghdad Bob when we went into Baghdad and he there's American tanks M1 Abrams rolling

619
00:42:57.76 --> 00:43:04.24
in crushing and he's like, we've got the Americans on the run. Yeah, we're running down your front door.

620
00:43:05.68 --> 00:43:11.12
So this is not this isn't going to work. Right. What you need to do is if reverses happen,

621
00:43:11.12 --> 00:43:14.80
you need to come out, you need to own them, you need to explain what happened and you need to

622
00:43:14.80 --> 00:43:17.92
get ahead of them. And don't let the room room in the turn into something worse than it is.

623
00:43:18.56 --> 00:43:22.40
You might be able to mitigate it. Don't lie about it. I'm not going to get you anywhere.

624
00:43:22.40 --> 00:43:30.000
Next defeated troops should not be allowed to fall into despair but they should be dealt with

625
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:39.12
by stirring up hope by various other means. Common sense. Next during combat, one has to overlook

626
00:43:39.12 --> 00:43:44.48
offenses committed by the soldiers but afterward get rid of men guilty of sedition.

627
00:43:45.84 --> 00:43:51.20
Which is like someone that's gonna rebel against you. Again, this is very this is a

628
00:43:51.20 --> 00:43:55.52
questionable. Right. If you during combat, if you start over looking at offenses, guess what you're

629
00:43:55.52 --> 00:44:05.84
going to end up with? Me lie, massacre. No, stop them. Disagreemories. Sorry. When you have a situation

630
00:44:05.84 --> 00:44:13.20
like that happening, you need to stop it. You need to put it into it. Now, that being said,

631
00:44:14.48 --> 00:44:21.04
are you gonna hand on every little thing that happens? No. Right. Maybe you're

632
00:44:21.04 --> 00:44:28.96
gonna give a little bit of slack with something that's pretty meaningless. Right. Maybe give a

633
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:35.28
little slack at the same time. You can't just, you gotta give you guys some room. That's what I'm

634
00:44:35.28 --> 00:44:39.76
saying. You gotta give you guys some room. You gotta hold the line absolutely. You gotta hold the line

635
00:44:40.32 --> 00:44:46.24
but you can't freak out because you got bigger. You should definitely have bigger things to worry

636
00:44:46.24 --> 00:44:54.96
about. Then this little item. Right. Let's just, hey, get that tightened up. Yeah. Let's move on.

637
00:44:54.96 --> 00:45:04.72
Let's not focus on it. I'm not gonna fire you because you made a mistake. Next,

638
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:11.68
our own dead should be buried secretly at night but the enemies should be left out there

639
00:45:11.68 --> 00:45:20.88
as a means of making them lose courage. Good psychological warfare. Next, when a delegation

640
00:45:20.88 --> 00:45:25.60
comes from the enemy, inquire about the leaders of the group and on their arrival treat them very

641
00:45:25.60 --> 00:45:32.24
friendly so their own people will come to suspect them. There's a lot of, there's a lot of little

642
00:45:33.52 --> 00:45:39.60
crafty little psychological warfare that they do. That's one of them. I like you know this enemy.

643
00:45:39.60 --> 00:45:44.72
Make the enemy look at him like else. Why is Jockel being so nice to echo right here?

644
00:45:44.72 --> 00:45:48.64
They're acting like they're old friends. They're gonna get suspicious of you. That's what I'm trying to

645
00:45:48.64 --> 00:45:56.88
do. Call some divide. Let's see. Yeah. Axe of cowardice on the part of our soldiers should be kept quiet

646
00:45:56.88 --> 00:46:01.60
and not publicly condemned since this may make them even worse. Again, we're talking about a

647
00:46:01.60 --> 00:46:05.92
communication thing and you're not gonna be able to, you're not gonna be able to keep that stuff

648
00:46:05.92 --> 00:46:16.72
under wraps. People are gonna know. So get ahead of it. Next, a way of arousing discord and suspicion

649
00:46:16.72 --> 00:46:22.000
among the enemy is to refrain from burning or plundering the estates of certain prominent men

650
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.08
on their side and of them alone. So go into the village, burn everyone's house except echoes.

651
00:46:30.08 --> 00:46:34.64
And you're like the prominent guy and they go, I go, what's up? How can we burn your house?

652
00:46:34.64 --> 00:46:39.12
You don't know I'm not friends with them? Oh really? Oh dang it. Yeah, really? We're gonna come back and

653
00:46:39.12 --> 00:46:47.04
we're gonna kill you. Yeah, like the cops, right? They do that. We're, they'll apprehend some guy in the

654
00:46:47.04 --> 00:46:51.60
cartel. I don't know whether they're the drug gang. And then they'll be like okay. Bye. They're like, oh

655
00:46:51.60 --> 00:46:55.04
they wait. You got to rest in nothing happened to you. They want no, it's all good. They're, they're

656
00:46:55.04 --> 00:47:04.08
mm, okay. Exactly. That's exactly it. Next, one way of getting a besieged city to submit

657
00:47:04.08 --> 00:47:10.56
is by sending letters tied to arrows promising freedom and immunity. This can also be done by releasing

658
00:47:10.56 --> 00:47:17.12
prisoners. Cool. Next, great caution must be observed in pursuing the enemy overground suited for

659
00:47:17.12 --> 00:47:22.16
ambushes. A good general will turn back at the right time so you can come back later to attack more

660
00:47:22.16 --> 00:47:29.36
effectively. That's why I'm not stopping my patrol to go back and attack an ambush that we just got

661
00:47:29.36 --> 00:47:35.84
through. So their ground, they have it, they're waiting for us. They have the advantage. They have it.

662
00:47:35.84 --> 00:47:40.80
They've been waiting there. Every art of war, every maximum world tell you, you want to have the

663
00:47:40.80 --> 00:47:45.44
upper hand. You want to pick the battlefield. They picked it. Yeah. Don't get into a scrap of them right

664
00:47:45.44 --> 00:47:53.84
there. Next, do not be deceived by humane acts of the enemy or by their pretending to retreat.

665
00:47:53.84 --> 00:48:03.04
Next, cowardly officers are recognized by their hesitation and power. During combat, they should be

666
00:48:03.04 --> 00:48:09.28
assigned to auxiliary forces. Notice that he is using them, right? Just because someone's a

667
00:48:09.28 --> 00:48:13.84
coward, he's still got work for him. And you go and run the logistics. You know, that's okay.

668
00:48:13.84 --> 00:48:22.72
Because I need bodies. I need people. Mm-hmm. When a populous city is taken, it is important to leave

669
00:48:22.72 --> 00:48:30.000
the gates open so that the inhabitants may escape and not be driven to utter desperation.

670
00:48:30.72 --> 00:48:36.32
The same holds on an enemy's fortified camp is taken. So we want to give people an out.

671
00:48:37.28 --> 00:48:42.48
So that they don't fight to the death. And this is very common with the ego. You don't,

672
00:48:42.48 --> 00:48:46.88
you don't, I don't trap you and prove you wrong in the room. Right? I don't even

673
00:48:46.88 --> 00:48:53.20
make a big meeting. I don't go ego. Here's the four reasons why you're completely wrong and they're indisputable.

674
00:48:53.20 --> 00:48:58.32
No, I give you a little out. I say, echo, you know, I've found these things. I think this might be a

675
00:48:58.32 --> 00:49:03.04
better way to do it. And by the way, you know, this also happens and this other things. So

676
00:49:03.68 --> 00:49:07.76
maybe we could adjust your planet a little bit and do it here. Now, if you have any sense whatsoever,

677
00:49:07.76 --> 00:49:12.000
you see all four of those reasons. You go, yeah, yeah, let's go ahead and do that, Joc.

678
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.32
Yeah, yeah. That's a good call. And I say, no problem. Boss. And we're good.

679
00:49:16.32 --> 00:49:21.76
Yep. But if I come in there and start making you look like a jackass, you're totally wrong.

680
00:49:21.76 --> 00:49:26.40
Your system doesn't work. You're going to dig in on that. No, we got issues. Now you're fighting

681
00:49:26.40 --> 00:49:36.56
to the death. Yeah. I'm going backwards. Next, even in friendly territory, a fortified camp should be

682
00:49:36.56 --> 00:49:42.000
set up. A general should never have to say I did not expect it.

683
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:51.52
Even in friendly territory, be ready. For a safe retreat, build a fire in one place and go off

684
00:49:51.52 --> 00:49:57.84
quietly to another. The enemy will head to the fire. Deception. Next, letters ought to be sent

685
00:49:57.84 --> 00:50:02.16
out to desergers from our side who have joined the enemy in such a way that the letters will fall

686
00:50:02.16 --> 00:50:08.80
into the enemy's hands. These letters should remind the desergers of the pre-range time for their

687
00:50:08.80 --> 00:50:13.44
treachery so that the enemy will become suspicious of them. They'll have to flee. That's a crafty.

688
00:50:15.20 --> 00:50:20.000
Crafty, little move. I'll echo you deserted us and hey, we'll meet you at this night so you can

689
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:29.36
give us the information. You told us you were going to give us. They hang you. Trader. Next,

690
00:50:30.08 --> 00:50:35.76
when it comes to dangerous or surprise operations, cowards could be weeded out if all the men who are

691
00:50:35.76 --> 00:50:42.64
sick or whose horses are too weak are ordered to fall out. The cowards will then claim to be

692
00:50:42.64 --> 00:50:48.24
sick and so they can be separated from the others. They can be assigned to guard forces or some

693
00:50:48.24 --> 00:50:52.88
other duty involving little danger. That's a good tactic. Think about that back in the day.

694
00:50:52.88 --> 00:50:58.08
Hey guys, if anyone's not feeling good, fall out over here because you're not 100% so we don't

695
00:50:58.08 --> 00:51:02.08
want to bring you in this operation. The cowards go lay out a little bit sick and feel along to the

696
00:51:02.08 --> 00:51:07.52
weather. Go you go guard the rear. Is that because like in a way they're not 100% either.

697
00:51:07.52 --> 00:51:12.96
Right? Yeah, they're not. And you're giving them an out. Yeah. Because they're not. They might not

698
00:51:12.96 --> 00:51:16.000
say anything but then at the moment of truth. They're not there to back you up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.16
So you can move out. Hey, if you're not feeling good, go over here in this line. Yeah. Okay, cool.

700
00:51:20.16 --> 00:51:28.08
Yeah, you're over there, coward. But I'm still going to utilize you. Yeah. Next, we should not

701
00:51:28.08 --> 00:51:33.28
furnish arms to those who promise to fight on our side because their real intentions are not clear.

702
00:51:34.24 --> 00:51:41.12
This is something America as a nation should get very familiar with. We should not furnish arms to

703
00:51:41.12 --> 00:51:46.56
those who promise to fight on our side because their real intentions are not clear. We give away

704
00:51:46.56 --> 00:51:53.68
arms in a ridiculous manner, ridiculous manner. And we shouldn't because the real intentions

705
00:51:53.68 --> 00:52:03.44
are not clear. Next, after victory, we must not become careless but beyond our guard,

706
00:52:03.44 --> 00:52:10.48
all the more against surprise attacks by the vanquished. Just because you won doesn't mean. And this is,

707
00:52:10.48 --> 00:52:17.28
you know Jeff Higgs, right? Yes. So this is something Higgs taught me. Like years ago,

708
00:52:17.28 --> 00:52:26.48
I'm talking blue belt in GJ2. If you Higgs GJ2, he's a seal. He got out of the seal teams. He got

709
00:52:26.48 --> 00:52:33.20
totally into GJ2. And the original guys I trained with with Master Chief Steve Bailey back in the

710
00:52:33.20 --> 00:52:39.36
day. So anyways, we were rolling one day and we were talking to him and he said,

711
00:52:40.16 --> 00:52:46.80
if you tap somebody, you got to go harder because they're going to go hard. Yeah. So if you, you know,

712
00:52:46.80 --> 00:52:50.96
and I'm telling me someone that you battle with, right? Someone that you battle with and all of a sudden,

713
00:52:50.96 --> 00:52:55.60
you get them better step up your game because they're going to go harder. Same thing right here.

714
00:52:55.60 --> 00:53:01.12
You got to show them. Yeah, you got to watch yourself. Yeah, I'll feel like if you're running the

715
00:53:01.12 --> 00:53:05.92
the mile, you know, like in track, you're running the mile. He pull away out of head, right? And

716
00:53:05.92 --> 00:53:10.72
you're like, oh, I'm, you know, this last lap. Whatever. You know, I'm just going to get it. Yeah,

717
00:53:10.72 --> 00:53:15.28
where you got to step it up because that guy that you've been beating, what, vanquished, whatever.

718
00:53:15.28 --> 00:53:23.12
Yeah, you know, he's coming. He's coming. Next, on voice from the enemy must not be treated

719
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:30.72
disrespectfully, even when our forces are much stronger. Next, an army no matter how strong,

720
00:53:30.72 --> 00:53:35.12
be seeding a city must never leave its own camp unguarded nor should it think that

721
00:53:35.12 --> 00:53:41.76
fortifications are sufficient to assure its safety. But you keep sending out patrols.

722
00:53:41.76 --> 00:53:47.28
Don't ever let your guard down. Saying this over and over again. Next, suspected defectors should

723
00:53:47.28 --> 00:53:51.60
be told the opposite of what we intend to do so that we may use them to deceive the enemy

724
00:53:51.60 --> 00:53:56.24
and treachery must be guarded against even during periods of truce or temporary peace.

725
00:53:58.48 --> 00:54:04.16
Next, by no means should we believe reports that come from deserters or defectors alone.

726
00:54:04.16 --> 00:54:08.56
But their reports should be checked against statements made by prisoners taken in raids

727
00:54:08.56 --> 00:54:14.64
and in this way the truth may be discerned. So you've got to check with all the different sources

728
00:54:14.64 --> 00:54:21.12
and this is something that the intelligence community does extremely well, which is they

729
00:54:22.08 --> 00:54:27.92
take all these different little chunks of information and they assemble it together into a picture.

730
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:31.44
You know, we've seen those pictures where it's just like a bunch of dots when you look at it

731
00:54:31.44 --> 00:54:37.12
up close. But then we step back at something real. Yeah. That's why these intelligence,

732
00:54:37.12 --> 00:54:41.12
these intelligence communities do they take all those little dots. It seems like a meaningless dot

733
00:54:41.12 --> 00:54:45.68
just a meaningless little dot. But they're going to put it on that broad picture and it's

734
00:54:45.68 --> 00:54:49.60
going to fill in one little piece of information that they need. You put all that stuff together and

735
00:54:49.60 --> 00:54:54.32
all something they know who you are. They know where to attack. Yeah, and that kind of makes sense

736
00:54:54.32 --> 00:54:59.52
there where it's like some deserter or somebody who basically doesn't have credibility.

737
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:04.24
Right. So that way like, hey, he's not necessarily lying, but he could be so he

738
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:08.32
becomes a real circumstance. You know, and then like how you're saying you put all the dots together

739
00:55:08.32 --> 00:55:12.000
and he has for some reason this dot. It's not fitting. It's not pinning a picture, but then you know,

740
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.84
okay, he's wish you washing anyway. So all right, I see he's lying right now. You know what I mean?

741
00:55:15.84 --> 00:55:18.48
Line about that piece, but maybe didn't lie about another piece. Yeah, you know what I mean?

742
00:55:19.52 --> 00:55:26.16
I'm exempt. Next, in no way, should a sworn agreement made with the enemy be broken?

743
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:32.64
Yeah. So if you, you need to hold hold hold your word, even with the enemy hold your word.

744
00:55:35.12 --> 00:55:41.76
Next, after God, we should place our hopes of safety in our weapons, not in our fortifications alone.

745
00:55:42.96 --> 00:55:49.60
Don't just count on the defense. Next order should be given to the soldiers that they should

746
00:55:49.60 --> 00:55:55.92
be ready to march out on a holiday in the rain day or night. For this reason, they should not be

747
00:55:55.92 --> 00:56:04.16
told the time or day beforehand so they may always be prepared. This is this reminding me of

748
00:56:04.16 --> 00:56:11.12
when my last epilomatorac and you're winding down and I told my guys, I said, hey, I'm not going

749
00:56:11.12 --> 00:56:14.64
to tell you guys when we're going to stop operations. We're just going to stop because I didn't

750
00:56:14.64 --> 00:56:19.12
want anybody going out thinking this is the last operation. Right. Just put plain safe. Yeah.

751
00:56:19.12 --> 00:56:23.68
I think guys when we're done, well, you know, but just keep going. Yeah.

752
00:56:23.68 --> 00:56:28.64
Guys, we're like, Roger that. Yeah. Keep going. And then one day we got doing. Yeah.

753
00:56:28.64 --> 00:56:34.08
But keep the mentality of, you know, don't think about this is going to be the last operation.

754
00:56:34.08 --> 00:56:37.12
You don't want to cruise into the first place and it's not the finish line. Right.

755
00:56:39.04 --> 00:56:46.48
Next, risks should be taken without necessity or real hope of gain. Sorry, risks should not be

756
00:56:46.48 --> 00:56:56.40
taken without necessity or real hope of gain to do so is the same as fishing with gold as bait.

757
00:57:00.96 --> 00:57:06.24
Next, inhabitants of the area who seek refuge should not be received indiscriminately.

758
00:57:07.60 --> 00:57:12.72
Often enough, they've been sent by the enemy to seatfully to plot against their hosts.

759
00:57:12.72 --> 00:57:18.24
This is something we ran into a lot in the money where people are acting normal and they

760
00:57:18.24 --> 00:57:22.08
knew our rules of engagement. And so they knew like, well, if they didn't have a gun, they

761
00:57:22.08 --> 00:57:26.88
were going to shoot them. And so they would do things that probe and they'd see how close they

762
00:57:26.88 --> 00:57:31.92
could get and see where we were. So just because these people are coming with their hands up,

763
00:57:31.92 --> 00:57:35.92
doesn't mean they're in a sense. You know, they might not be guilty. They might not be in a

764
00:57:35.92 --> 00:57:42.16
city there. Next, we should also be on our guard against deserves who approach a besieged city,

765
00:57:42.16 --> 00:57:46.72
often enough they are sent by the enemy to set fire so that while the defenders are busy putting

766
00:57:46.72 --> 00:57:54.08
them out, the enemy may attack them. Just be cautious. Troops defeated an open battle should not

767
00:57:54.08 --> 00:57:59.68
be pampered or even if it seems like a good idea take refuge in a fortified camp or some other

768
00:57:59.68 --> 00:58:07.36
strong place. But while their fear is still fresh, they should attack again. By not indulging them,

769
00:58:07.36 --> 00:58:15.44
may they may with greater assurance renew the fighting. So don't take care. You can't just say,

770
00:58:15.44 --> 00:58:21.76
oh, we beat you. So come on in the camp and relax. No, not happening. Next, if the general thinks

771
00:58:21.76 --> 00:58:26.72
he's ready to meet the enemy in battle, he should get set to carry on the fighting in the

772
00:58:26.72 --> 00:58:32.000
enemy's country instead of his own. Men waging war in a foreign land become more aggressive.

773
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.96
They will also feel that the war in which they are engaged is not only being fought in

774
00:58:36.96 --> 00:58:42.56
behalf of their country, but also their own personal safety. This is not necessarily the case

775
00:58:42.56 --> 00:58:48.16
if the war is fought in their own land in which the existence of fortresses eliminates the risks

776
00:58:48.16 --> 00:58:53.36
to men since in case of flight they may easily take refuge in them. This is a little bit

777
00:58:53.36 --> 00:58:58.72
different than what we might deal with today. Because today, when you deploy to some country

778
00:58:58.72 --> 00:59:03.92
and fight, that's not your homeland. So you're saying, and I, you know what? This is this,

779
00:59:03.92 --> 00:59:08.96
you know, I don't have to defend this. And can you imagine if America got invaded how hard

780
00:59:08.96 --> 00:59:14.80
the Americans would fight? You know, one could ever pull it off. It would be too hard. Because

781
00:59:14.80 --> 00:59:21.20
once the Americans say, oh, you're going to take my country, would not anything. But any not

782
00:59:21.20 --> 00:59:26.72
happen. Yeah, not happening. Yeah, go try and take someone's parking space in America. Here,

783
00:59:26.72 --> 00:59:30.56
they're ready to kill you. I know. So you think you're going to take land from us? Not

784
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:35.60
happening. Not going to happen. So there's a little bit different. But the mentality of being aggressive

785
00:59:35.60 --> 00:59:40.88
and of in what I think what the mentality is talking about is knowing that you can retreat, knowing

786
00:59:40.88 --> 00:59:45.60
that you can go back to your fortress. So that means, you know, in this day and age or sorry,

787
00:59:45.60 --> 00:59:52.32
in that era, they knew they couldn't, they didn't have any, all they could do is fight. They had to win.

788
00:59:52.32 --> 00:59:59.44
Right. You know what this is great comparison is in the in the old school navy. You had no choice.

789
01:00:00.16 --> 01:00:06.16
You have no choice on a naval vessel. You have no choice but to fight. You have no choice because

790
01:00:06.16 --> 01:00:12.56
if your ship gets on your dead in the on the ground, you can run away. You can hide. You can retreat.

791
01:00:12.56 --> 01:00:16.72
You can fall back. Where do you fall back to on a ship that's being attacked? You don't. You go

792
01:00:16.72 --> 01:00:23.28
on the ocean and you die. So that's one of the kind of core things that's old school navy. You

793
01:00:23.28 --> 01:00:29.68
cannot retreat. You cannot give up. You can't. You can't surrender. You can't surrender. It's

794
01:00:29.68 --> 01:00:36.16
if you surrender, you die. If you don't fight with everything you got, you die. So you have no choice

795
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:43.28
but to fight until you're dead. That's kind of the the mentality of the old school navy.

796
01:00:43.28 --> 01:00:47.84
No way to run to. You can't can't retreat. Can't fall back. You're there.

797
01:00:50.64 --> 01:00:55.20
So that little section was called the general instructions for the commander.

798
01:00:56.40 --> 01:00:58.48
And now we get into the straight up. Maximum.

799
01:01:02.08 --> 01:01:08.000
First one. The man who spends more sleepless nights with his army and who works harder in

800
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.28
drilling his troops runs the fewest risks in fighting the foe. Self evident.

801
01:01:17.20 --> 01:01:23.84
Mine's made you leave. In colder than hell. Who remember they're like patrolling to combat and he's

802
01:01:23.84 --> 01:01:31.60
got the guys doing drills? Yeah, after it. Next, never lead soldiers into combat before they

803
01:01:31.60 --> 01:01:35.84
before having made sufficient trial of their courage. So why we train hard.

804
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:46.000
Next, it is well to hurt the enemy by deceit, by raids or by hunger and never be enticed into a

805
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.48
pitch battle, which is demonstration more of luck than of bravery. So he's saying a pitch battle is

806
01:01:52.48 --> 01:01:58.80
like a blizzard. Luck. Luck. Yeah. What's a pitch pitch battle? Face to face. Yeah.

807
01:01:58.80 --> 01:02:07.12
Next, only those battle plans are successful, which the enemy does not suspect before we put them into action.

808
01:02:10.08 --> 01:02:16.48
Next, deception is often helpful in warfare. And enemy soldier who desserts us, apart from some plot,

809
01:02:16.48 --> 01:02:22.40
is of the greatest advantage. For the enemy is hurt by deserves more than if the same man

810
01:02:22.40 --> 01:02:31.04
were killed in action. Next, he who does not carefully compare his own forces with those the enemy

811
01:02:32.16 --> 01:02:41.12
will come to a disastrous end. Here's a good one for you. Courage and discipline are able to

812
01:02:41.12 --> 01:02:49.12
accomplish more than a large number of warriors. Often enough, the lay of the land has been helpful

813
01:02:49.12 --> 01:02:54.32
in making the weaker force come out on top. Terrain. Those you in the military,

814
01:02:54.32 --> 01:02:59.12
terrain learn how to read terrain, learn how to use terrain. Learn how to figure out the

815
01:02:59.12 --> 01:03:02.72
high ground. Learn out where the dead spaces are. Learn where the ravines are that put you in a

816
01:03:02.72 --> 01:03:11.44
better, better, finerning position. Next, nature produces but a few brave men,

817
01:03:11.44 --> 01:03:19.52
whereas care and training make efficient soldiers. Soldiers who are kept working improve

818
01:03:19.52 --> 01:03:24.80
encourage. I'm gonna say that again, soldiers who are kept working improve encourage

819
01:03:25.60 --> 01:03:38.08
while too much leisure makes them weak and lazy. Next, things which are unexpected or sudden

820
01:03:38.08 --> 01:03:42.96
frighten the enemy, but they pay little attention to things to which they are accustomed.

821
01:03:44.56 --> 01:03:51.28
You used to that. After gaining a victory, a general who pursues the enemy with a scattered

822
01:03:51.28 --> 01:04:00.16
and disorganized army gives away his victory to his foe. Here's a simple one. The cause of war must be

823
01:04:00.16 --> 01:04:10.000
just. Next, it does not help to assemble the whole army in counsel where to keep sending from

824
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.84
men when they are off duty. These things only cause discord in the army. I put that one in there

825
01:04:17.84 --> 01:04:20.88
because this is a place to business a lot. We're all of us on your call in that person all the

826
01:04:20.88 --> 01:04:29.36
weekend. Nice stuff meeting. I need to talk to everyone on their off day. Burn them out. Be careful

827
01:04:29.36 --> 01:04:36.96
that. Next, the soldiers must always be doing something even if no enemy is bothering us. A

828
01:04:36.96 --> 01:04:42.56
bitual, idleness spells trouble for an army. So those two are kind of contradictory. They don't

829
01:04:42.56 --> 01:04:47.36
me call them people all the time, but keep busy. We got to figure out how we separate, even

830
01:04:47.36 --> 01:04:55.20
the business world, how do you separate work from life? And as the boss, you got to make that distinction.

831
01:04:55.20 --> 01:05:01.36
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of seems like that makes sense. I mean, consider like exercise or something.

832
01:05:01.92 --> 01:05:08.24
Like you got to have the recovery period. Yes. But I can't be just cruising, skipping days all the time.

833
01:05:08.24 --> 01:05:13.12
You know? So it's like that. What do you call it in the in the deal? Dye caught him. There's a

834
01:05:13.12 --> 01:05:24.24
dichotomy. Yes. Nicely done. Thank you. Next, for what should be done seek the advice of many.

835
01:05:25.52 --> 01:05:33.20
For what you will actually do take counsel with only a few trustworthy people. Then off by yourself,

836
01:05:33.20 --> 01:05:40.96
alone decide on the best and most helpful plan to follow and stick to it. Hey, everyone

837
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:44.88
tell me what's going on. Give me your ideas. Yeah, okay. Great. A little bit smaller group. Okay,

838
01:05:44.88 --> 01:05:49.12
guys. There's the input we got. What do you think? And then guess what? The commander's got to make

839
01:05:49.12 --> 01:05:54.40
a decision. Yeah. You can weigh all those different inputs, but the commander's got to make a decision.

840
01:05:54.40 --> 01:05:59.76
Yeah. And when you make the decision, you got to own it. Now one thing that's interesting,

841
01:05:59.76 --> 01:06:06.80
and I don't mean to go on too much of a tangent here. But I'll make a decision

842
01:06:06.80 --> 01:06:17.84
and execute with aggression. But my mind is not closed. And if I go, say, we're going to do

843
01:06:17.84 --> 01:06:23.04
acts and we start executing acts and acts is not looking good. I'll say stop executing acts. I was wrong.

844
01:06:23.04 --> 01:06:27.12
Here's what we're going to do. So just because you're being decisive doesn't mean that you're being

845
01:06:27.12 --> 01:06:32.80
stupid. Just because you're being decisive doesn't mean you're not you're losing your plasticity.

846
01:06:32.80 --> 01:06:37.28
Yeah. Yeah. We don't lose our plasticity even when we make a hard decision. Even when I say,

847
01:06:37.28 --> 01:06:42.64
this is what we're going to do. My mind is still open. And again, a lot of times I'll try and break

848
01:06:42.64 --> 01:06:49.52
as a leader. I will try and break big decisions into smaller incremental decisions that allow me

849
01:06:49.52 --> 01:06:56.24
to change course during the execution. And you know, for, and I've told the, I've said this

850
01:06:56.24 --> 01:07:00.96
something like this before, but if we got a bad guy target and we think the bad guy's going to be

851
01:07:00.96 --> 01:07:05.60
there, the first thing we're going to tell the guys to start planning. So they're going to start planning.

852
01:07:05.60 --> 01:07:10.80
Then I might put them okay guys, we're going to go and put you guys in the staging area.

853
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:14.32
Well, they execute. We're executing, but we are not executing. Right. All you're doing is going to

854
01:07:14.32 --> 01:07:19.20
a staging area. Yeah. Then I might even put a reconnaissance element out to watch the target.

855
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.76
We're executing, but we're not executing. I could still say, okay, stop. Everyone come back home.

856
01:07:23.76 --> 01:07:26.64
We don't think he's there. We don't think it's a good mission. We think it's a trap. Whatever.

857
01:07:26.64 --> 01:07:32.32
So I gave, I committed. I made a decision. We're going to hit this target. But I made that decision

858
01:07:32.32 --> 01:07:37.04
incrementally. I didn't just say we're going to hit it. And now no matter what happens. So a lot of

859
01:07:37.04 --> 01:07:42.56
times as a leader, I look at the big decision. Okay. Yeah, it's a big decision. And I'm going to be

860
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:47.44
decisive on it. But I'm going to make incremental progress towards that decision that way I can be

861
01:07:47.44 --> 01:07:52.88
adaptable as I move towards that execution. Yeah. The very important lesson to learn. Very important

862
01:07:52.88 --> 01:08:00.16
lesson to learn. I never just jump off the cliff. It's like you're creating a point of no return.

863
01:08:00.16 --> 01:08:05.20
Right. Oh, I'm a third of something. Yeah, there's a, there's a last point of covering

864
01:08:05.20 --> 01:08:10.24
concealment is an actual term that we lose. Use last point of cover. So that means there's a target.

865
01:08:10.64 --> 01:08:16.08
And once you cross this line, now you actually do have to go. Yeah. Now you, you're out in the open.

866
01:08:16.08 --> 01:08:22.80
They can see you. Yeah, do it. So that's the point. But that point should come so far down the road.

867
01:08:22.80 --> 01:08:28.64
That you can execute the target. You can execute the target. You can execute the target. But you still

868
01:08:28.64 --> 01:08:33.20
have an actually executed until you've gone past that last point of covering concealment. Once

869
01:08:33.20 --> 01:08:37.04
you're there, once you go past the last point of covering concealment, you're done. You have to go.

870
01:08:37.44 --> 01:08:41.04
But that should be very late in the game. And it's the same thing in the business world. Oh, we want

871
01:08:41.04 --> 01:08:45.44
to open up into this new market. Okay. Let's do a reconnaissance that market. You're executing.

872
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:49.52
But you might do reconnaissance. The market is a, you know what, it's not what we thought it was going

873
01:08:49.52 --> 01:08:55.60
to be. Stop. Okay. Let's get a building. Listen, are you going to lease? We're not going to buy.

874
01:08:55.60 --> 01:08:59.60
You're going there by a building because we don't want to own that thing yet. We don't know the terrain

875
01:08:59.60 --> 01:09:04.24
well enough. We're going to lease a building. Guess what we're doing. We do an eight year lease. No,

876
01:09:04.24 --> 01:09:10.16
no, no, no. We're doing a two year lease. We're just going to slowly execute incrementally. Because

877
01:09:10.16 --> 01:09:15.36
we might get in there and say, it's not looking good. So think about how you can break these major

878
01:09:15.36 --> 01:09:19.68
decisions down into smaller incremental decisions that give you the adaptability.

879
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:29.84
Next. If an enemy spy is captured while observing our forces, then it may well, it may be

880
01:09:29.84 --> 01:09:35.68
well to release him unharmed if all our forces are strong and in good shape. The enemy will absolutely

881
01:09:35.68 --> 01:09:41.92
disbead this made by such reports. On the other hand, if our forces are weak, the spy should be treated

882
01:09:41.92 --> 01:09:49.84
roughly forced to divulge enemy secrets and finally either be put to death or send off elsewhere

883
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:54.96
under guard. Obviously, we don't put our prisoners to death anymore. But you know what's interesting

884
01:09:54.96 --> 01:09:59.68
about this in the business world and I work with all kinds of different companies. And the reason

885
01:09:59.68 --> 01:10:06.88
I keep talking about this spy stuff and the captured is because every industry, every industry out there,

886
01:10:06.88 --> 01:10:18.000
they are constantly competing for people. And whether it's this technology companies, whether it's

887
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.64
financial companies, they're always trying to recruit each other and trying to get this guy

888
01:10:22.64 --> 01:10:26.40
to leave and they're trying to pull this person over every different, a lot of times I work with

889
01:10:26.40 --> 01:10:29.68
companies, they don't realize that all of the companies are like this. There's only the, you know,

890
01:10:29.68 --> 01:10:33.44
they say, well, you know, the thing is we get, people are trying to recruit our people all the time.

891
01:10:33.44 --> 01:10:37.76
Yes, it happens in every industry, every industry has got people trying to recruit their people.

892
01:10:38.88 --> 01:10:44.24
And that's why I'm talking about this stuff because if you think about it, if you know someone's

893
01:10:44.24 --> 01:10:49.04
going to go to another company, let's give them some bad intelligence before they leave.

894
01:10:49.60 --> 01:10:53.04
You know, let's say that we're thinking, we're, we're not going to go into that market. Let

895
01:10:53.04 --> 01:10:58.88
them know that. You are going to know about it. We'll speak. Yeah, full speed. Yeah. So that's what I

896
01:10:58.88 --> 01:11:07.28
am saying this. Again, you know, you get to this point where, you know, as a, as a upstanding human being,

897
01:11:08.08 --> 01:11:14.72
let's be straight up with people. But I'm assuming now that someone has maybe done you wrong.

898
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.24
They're trying to take clients. They're trying to take business away from your business.

899
01:11:20.80 --> 01:11:25.12
He's now getting into a little bit of a, we're in a little some hostilities are brewing. Yeah.

900
01:11:25.12 --> 01:11:29.12
So some psychological warfare game within the game. There's a game within the game. Yeah. Yeah.

901
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:37.12
Yeah. There's a game within the game. And again, you have to maintain your integrity as a, as a,

902
01:11:37.12 --> 01:11:46.64
as a human. And then that's that is definitely for me, the, the absolute primary thing,

903
01:11:46.64 --> 01:11:52.32
right, to maintain your integrity. They're not maintaining your integrity with you. We may be

904
01:11:52.32 --> 01:11:56.40
they're going to get some misinformation on the way out the door. Sorry. That's the way it works. Yeah.

905
01:11:57.52 --> 01:12:02.64
And like, you know, they're not, I'll, I'll kind of draw back on that a little bit and I'll tell you why.

906
01:12:04.48 --> 01:12:10.000
What one of the best things about when someone leaves a company, one of the best things you can do is

907
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.56
treat them good as they leave. Yeah. Really? Because that, because when they show up at that new company

908
01:12:14.56 --> 01:12:19.04
that made all these promises to them, that are not true. Yeah. And, and they're looking back and going,

909
01:12:19.04 --> 01:12:22.48
man, you know, Jockel was just honest with me. And he told me he wanted me to stay and he told me that,

910
01:12:22.48 --> 01:12:25.04
you know, we're going to grow and he told me to never not put you right now, but he was following the

911
01:12:25.04 --> 01:12:31.68
future. He believes me. Yeah. So I'm going to actually retract my statement about using these kind of,

912
01:12:32.24 --> 01:12:37.28
you know, putting your integrity at risk. It's better to maintain your integrity. And it might not be

913
01:12:37.28 --> 01:12:43.04
better instantly, but in the long run, you're going to be better off even with like a spy situation. So,

914
01:12:43.04 --> 01:12:49.12
I mean, kind of consider, if you were to draw the analogy of a spy, like, let's say a tamp came in your

915
01:12:49.12 --> 01:12:54.80
company and he's really a spy because he's a temp somewhere else. I don't know whatever. And you find out

916
01:12:54.80 --> 01:13:00.16
or you get, you know, like information, whatever that that leads you to believe about that guy's a spy.

917
01:13:00.16 --> 01:13:05.60
Right. And then you start essentially lying to him about projects or I don't know whatever goals.

918
01:13:05.60 --> 01:13:09.68
Yeah, I probably just get rid of him. Yeah. I'd probably just treat him nice kind. I'd be like, hey,

919
01:13:09.68 --> 01:13:14.48
listen, I don't think you're here for the best reasons. Yeah. And in fact, I think you came from this

920
01:13:14.48 --> 01:13:21.20
organization. And I'm going to let you go. If you ever want to come back here in earnest,

921
01:13:21.20 --> 01:13:28.24
you know what? I think you got a lot of potential. And I think I think, hold on, I think that the fact that

922
01:13:28.24 --> 01:13:34.32
they did this to you, it shows that they don't really respect you. Yeah. And but if you want to come to

923
01:13:34.32 --> 01:13:41.20
a place where you will be respected and where we work with integrity, this is the place for you.

924
01:13:41.20 --> 01:13:44.96
Let me know if that ever happens. But for now, because the way this is shaken out,

925
01:13:45.52 --> 01:13:48.88
I can't, I can't have you here. Because you know what I'm trying to do? I'm trying to protect my

926
01:13:48.88 --> 01:13:52.88
team. I'm trying to protect what we're doing here. And you know what we're doing? We're doing something

927
01:13:52.88 --> 01:13:57.20
positive. And you're bringing right now, it shows you the weakness of the people that you've been

928
01:13:57.20 --> 01:14:00.72
working with on the other side. It shows you that they're weak. They're trying to do these things.

929
01:14:00.72 --> 01:14:06.08
It's not going to affect us, by the way. We are going to win. Why are we going to win? Because

930
01:14:06.08 --> 01:14:12.32
we are staying on the path. See now, you approach it like that. You're going to win all day long.

931
01:14:12.32 --> 01:14:18.32
So let's just retrap. You know, that's why people don't understand man, integrity is so important.

932
01:14:18.32 --> 01:14:22.80
And the minute you start giving up, even under these adverse conditions, when you give up your integrity

933
01:14:22.80 --> 01:14:26.48
in the Longland, you're going to hurt yourself. And I kind of got drawn into it, right? Even

934
01:14:26.48 --> 01:14:31.28
myself, I'm like, oh yeah, spies and all this. No, be straight up. Yeah. Painting your

935
01:14:31.28 --> 01:14:36.000
attack. Don't put them to death. No, I'm not allowed to do that. Yeah, dang, that's actually

936
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:44.08
that's way more advanced than kind of what I was going to ask you. So what if like you expose them?

937
01:14:44.64 --> 01:14:50.72
You know, if you expose the company or the person like, oh, hey, everyone, I don't know,

938
01:14:50.72 --> 01:14:55.28
you know, not we have, you know, yeah, well, I think it'd be, I would do it in an appropriate way,

939
01:14:55.28 --> 01:14:59.84
you know, I wouldn't be trying to set them up and make them look a bit say, hey, listen,

940
01:14:59.84 --> 01:15:06.16
guys, we found out that Bill, he's actually, he's actually still getting paid by X company over there.

941
01:15:06.72 --> 01:15:14.08
And Bill, we, we're going to have to let you go. Appreciate you coming over. But, you know, we here are a

942
01:15:14.08 --> 01:15:20.96
team. We stick together. You're not part of the team, obviously. So we can't have here.

943
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:26.80
If you ever decide that the week team you came from is not for you and you want to get on board with the

944
01:15:26.80 --> 01:15:34.56
winning team, let me know. Yeah, that's advanced to kind of let them know that like, hey, I still like you

945
01:15:34.56 --> 01:15:38.64
and everything kind of thing. You know, the opposite of burning a bridge. Yeah, like you're

946
01:15:38.64 --> 01:15:42.48
in a building. And there is nothing better. A lot of times companies that we work with,

947
01:15:43.36 --> 01:15:49.20
somebody will leave and it will be under those weird circumstances, right? They'll get on a good offer.

948
01:15:49.20 --> 01:15:55.84
Or, you know, again, all companies do this. They say, I'll give you a signing bonus.

949
01:15:55.84 --> 01:16:00.48
Yeah, you'll be signing bonus to come over. Okay. And a signing bonus that looks,

950
01:16:00.48 --> 01:16:03.52
that's a way to get somebody over and they say, don't want to give you this and we'll give you a corner

951
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:07.36
officer. We'll give you this. We'll give you a helpers and you know, that will give you this title,

952
01:16:07.36 --> 01:16:12.80
right? Oh, yeah, they're warming with all those things. But all those are recruiters.

953
01:16:13.60 --> 01:16:18.64
They're not telling the truth about stuff. Sometimes. The worst, the best recruiters tell everything

954
01:16:18.64 --> 01:16:21.52
straight up. Right? The best recruiters are like, oh, you're, you're doing this.

955
01:16:21.52 --> 01:16:24.56
Yeah, they were really good at that. Your company, you're at Echo. They're really good with that.

956
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:29.44
You're right. Here's where their weaknesses are. Here's where we beat them. You're decision.

957
01:16:30.64 --> 01:16:34.96
It's, it's honest. And it's such your expectations, right? So they want to show up. You, you're not

958
01:16:34.96 --> 01:16:39.60
thinking, what Jockel, you said that this was the best at at X. Now I didn't say that.

959
01:16:39.60 --> 01:16:44.96
Is it where the best at Y? The X were working on. Right? That's what you want to do. It's just,

960
01:16:44.96 --> 01:16:48.40
I want to talk about it's integrity. That's what we're talking about. And you got to maintain it.

961
01:16:49.52 --> 01:16:50.96
That's thing to do. Yeah.

962
01:16:53.76 --> 01:16:59.12
Easy to win in those scenarios. Is that one of those take the high road or the high

963
01:16:59.12 --> 01:17:05.36
high ground or the high ground is going to take you. Absolutely. All right.

964
01:17:07.52 --> 01:17:13.28
Back to the book. If the soldier's show signs of cowardice, various skills

965
01:17:13.28 --> 01:17:21.92
should be used to restore their courage. Next, take your time in planning. But when you have made

966
01:17:21.92 --> 01:17:31.28
decision be fast and putting it into action. In war, opportunity is fleeting and cannot be put off at all.

967
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.88
Opportunity is fleeting. I was not just talking about war. That's talking about business.

968
01:17:36.88 --> 01:17:41.76
That's talking about life. Your opportunities in life are fleeting. What are you doing with them?

969
01:17:41.76 --> 01:17:45.76
What do you do with the opportunities you have in front of you right now? Are you capitalizing

970
01:17:45.76 --> 01:17:49.52
on them? Are you going after them? Because they're fleeting. They're not going to be there.

971
01:17:50.08 --> 01:17:55.20
They might be there tomorrow. They might be. In a week, where are they? In a month, where are they?

972
01:17:55.20 --> 01:18:00.40
They're gone. Opportunities are fleeting. Let's get after them.

973
01:18:03.44 --> 01:18:09.44
Next, let the army see that you are not unduly-related over successes nor utterly cast down by failures.

974
01:18:09.44 --> 01:18:14.56
We already covered that. Next, it is not the general whose words are frightening.

975
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:20.96
But the one who gets things done, who is feared by the enemy.

976
01:18:23.36 --> 01:18:29.12
That's a big one. There be the person that makes things happen. Be the person that makes things happen.

977
01:18:30.64 --> 01:18:35.60
That's, you know, in the military. My guys, I was at, you know, a seawelplatoon or a

978
01:18:35.60 --> 01:18:42.08
sealed task unit or when I was running training. I had guys, my boys, my people,

979
01:18:42.08 --> 01:18:45.68
and they made things happen. If I said something to them, it was going to happen. It was going to happen.

980
01:18:45.68 --> 01:18:50.72
There was no, I didn't barely, I didn't give it any direction. That's a hey, we need this. They took,

981
01:18:50.72 --> 01:18:57.04
got it. Done. Done. That's the kind of person you want to be. Not the person that comes back.

982
01:18:57.04 --> 01:19:02.08
You know, a week later, we tried to make some progress here. But I really ran into a brick wall with

983
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:09.04
so and so. My guys didn't hit brick walls. If they hit them, they hit them with sled jammers and

984
01:19:09.04 --> 01:19:19.20
busted through them. So Jade would. Jade Charles. Echo Charles is brother. Yeah. So he'd be like,

985
01:19:21.20 --> 01:19:24.88
this happened more than once. This is why I'm saying he would do this. But maybe twice.

986
01:19:24.88 --> 01:19:32.000
I don't know. Anyway, he'd say, hey, I know you're going to the store go buy me some wine while you're there. And he's like,

987
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.48
hey, it's this kind of whatever kind. So I'm like, all right, I'll do that for you. You know,

988
01:19:40.48 --> 01:19:50.16
favor kind, no problem. I go in the wine section. I'll whatever. And he's like, hey, it's this. And

989
01:19:50.16 --> 01:19:56.40
there's, you know, there's wine. There's white rain, red rain, burdo, cabernay, all the other one. Yeah.

990
01:19:56.40 --> 01:20:01.20
And then there's the brand. So basically, it's a wall. The whole thing is all wind. It's not the kind

991
01:20:01.20 --> 01:20:05.52
of where there's sugar here oil. This all wind. Different kind. And he's like, I want this kind.

992
01:20:05.52 --> 01:20:09.68
I'm looking at this thing. Brow is here for tomatoes. That's it. I don't want to spend one hour

993
01:20:09.68 --> 01:20:15.20
looking for a way. So you kind of come to like this decision. You got to make, you know, I could easily

994
01:20:15.20 --> 01:20:20.24
just grab my tomatoes, go and be like, bro, you know what you sent me on a treasure hunt for

995
01:20:20.24 --> 01:20:25.60
your wine. I could say that. And it'd be justifiable, really. So now I have a bottle? No, yeah, no.

996
01:20:26.56 --> 01:20:31.52
As you say, hold the line. He asked for wine. I said I would get wine. I'm going to get wine.

997
01:20:31.52 --> 01:20:37.12
And I'm not going to say anything about it. So what I did, found it. Give it to him. And I know where it is,

998
01:20:37.12 --> 01:20:43.76
no. legit. Right? Because justifiably, I could have said, bro, hey, I'll do it next time. Or

999
01:20:43.76 --> 01:20:47.36
show them next time where they're showing me where it is. You know, but, bro, I didn't have that kind of

1000
01:20:47.36 --> 01:20:54.48
time. Whatever. You know, you got the mission done. Yeah, do. What do the guys say? They say,

1001
01:20:54.48 --> 01:21:04.88
don't talk about it. Be about it. Yeah, don't talk about it. All right, next. Plan what you have to do

1002
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:12.56
at night and carry out your decision during the day. One cannot plan and act at the same time.

1003
01:21:14.24 --> 01:21:21.68
For you're a better night, make your list of what got to get done. Next, the general who is

1004
01:21:21.68 --> 01:21:28.24
overly harsh with his subordinates and the one who is too indulgent are both unfit for command.

1005
01:21:28.24 --> 01:21:39.36
Fear leads to great hatred and giving in too much results in being despised. It is best to take

1006
01:21:39.36 --> 01:21:47.28
the middle course. Means balance. Got a balance. So this is the dichotomy of leadership.

1007
01:21:47.84 --> 01:21:52.32
Don't be over-hars, don't want to be too indulgent. Like the fact that he says, giving too much

1008
01:21:52.32 --> 01:21:59.52
results in being despised. And it's interesting. I've heard that. Like in the seal teams.

1009
01:21:59.52 --> 01:22:05.20
Wait, that expression? No, I was going to see that. I see that. Yeah. Where you get a guy. Of course,

1010
01:22:05.20 --> 01:22:11.44
you get a guy, you get a platoon leader. That's really over the bearing and no one likes him.

1011
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.04
And it's not a good unit. But you get the guy that just gives everything. He's not like

1012
01:22:17.04 --> 01:22:23.20
either. They're not respected. That's the problem. He might be everyone's body. It doesn't make anything happen.

1013
01:22:23.20 --> 01:22:29.92
It doesn't have a good unit. Yeah, no, for sure. Next, after agreeing upon a treaty or

1014
01:22:29.92 --> 01:22:34.16
true, so the enemy that commander should make sure that his camp is guarded more strongly and

1015
01:22:34.16 --> 01:22:38.56
more closely. I bet you Maurice, the way he relates these things, they must have gotten

1016
01:22:39.36 --> 01:22:46.24
reattacked on multiple occasions because he is paranoid. If the enemy chooses to break the agreement,

1017
01:22:46.24 --> 01:22:54.48
they will only gain a reputation for faithfulness and disfavor of God. While we shall remain

1018
01:22:54.48 --> 01:22:59.84
in safety and be true to our word, the general should not have to say, I did not expect it.

1019
01:23:01.36 --> 01:23:07.92
Next, for small forces, we should select a place with a narrow front who's with the corresponds

1020
01:23:07.92 --> 01:23:12.96
to the size of our army, the superior numbers of the enemy are useless in such a place since

1021
01:23:12.96 --> 01:23:19.36
there is no room for them. This is classic battle for mobily. Pick a place that's really narrow.

1022
01:23:19.36 --> 01:23:28.32
So all those Persians can attack you at the same time. Is a good idea to maneuver so that the

1023
01:23:28.32 --> 01:23:34.64
son, wind and dust are behind our men and in the face of the enemy. By so obscuring his vision

1024
01:23:34.64 --> 01:23:42.72
and making his breathing difficult, we should quickly be victorious. Think about those environmentals.

1025
01:23:45.28 --> 01:23:51.28
Next, we should line up our troops for battle before the enemy gets ready. This puts us in a position

1026
01:23:51.28 --> 01:23:57.60
to do what we wish and barely allows the enemy time to arm. So behead, be early, get up early,

1027
01:23:57.60 --> 01:24:04.56
be first, be first. If we are all set for the charge, then we can attack the enemy in safety

1028
01:24:04.56 --> 01:24:13.20
with our men full of confidence in the enemy very worried. Next, if the enemy is put to flight,

1029
01:24:13.20 --> 01:24:19.44
our soldiers must be restrained from plundering. Otherwise, they are scattered doing while they are

1030
01:24:19.44 --> 01:24:26.16
scattered doing this, the enemy might reform and attack them. Once again, I like Maurice's paranoia.

1031
01:24:26.16 --> 01:24:33.28
Next, the general is that fault if most of the army is destroyed in a single battle.

1032
01:24:36.72 --> 01:24:40.32
We wrote a book called Extreme Ownership. That's what it's about. Only.

1033
01:24:42.88 --> 01:24:48.64
Next, an army which shouts out its war cries, good and loud, can strike terror into the enemy.

1034
01:24:48.64 --> 01:24:56.56
Is that like the rugby, the New Zealand, the all blacks? They are doing that?

1035
01:24:56.56 --> 01:25:02.96
Yeah, the Hawke is awesome. Have you ever seen there's a, they do the Hawke and like memorial

1036
01:25:02.96 --> 01:25:10.64
services? Yeah. That is very moving. That doesn't get much more moving than that. Yeah, they get up.

1037
01:25:10.64 --> 01:25:14.56
Even the football teams in Hawaii do that too. Some of them don't do that before the game.

1038
01:25:14.56 --> 01:25:19.44
It's kind of, I think in Hawaii they're used to it, so it might not have the effect. But what if

1039
01:25:19.44 --> 01:25:23.44
you never seen it before, you're not expecting it, they do that. You're like, Bro, these guys are kind of like

1040
01:25:23.44 --> 01:25:31.20
derrated or not, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Next, our commander, all to adapt his strategies

1041
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:39.76
to the disposition of the enemy general. If the ladder is inclined to rash nish, he might be enticed to

1042
01:25:39.76 --> 01:25:48.32
premature and reckless action. If he is on the timid side, he may be struck down

1043
01:25:49.04 --> 01:25:53.76
by continual surprise raid. So you're making adapters. I was like, oh, I know you got a bad

1044
01:25:53.76 --> 01:25:58.48
temper. Oh, I'm going to remember to bring it out. Or you're, you're passive. Cool. I'm going to get

1045
01:25:58.48 --> 01:26:05.04
aggressive on you. The general should be impartial in dealing with his own men with allied

1046
01:26:05.04 --> 01:26:11.12
and with allied forces. He should be a just judge for both when he gives presence to the allies.

1047
01:26:11.12 --> 01:26:16.000
He should make a regular increase in the grittuties for his own soldiers. So he's talking about

1048
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.60
they would adopt these other armies and he's seen treat them fairly. Treat them just like, you know

1049
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:27.84
where you see this is a lot of is when when we get acquisitions in the business world. So one

1050
01:26:27.84 --> 01:26:34.48
company takes over another company and a good leader is going to treat people fairly. A bad leader

1051
01:26:34.48 --> 01:26:39.76
is going to be taken care of the guys and he's always doing with him. So you got to be careful that.

1052
01:26:44.16 --> 01:26:51.20
In wartime, the general should do more than his share of the work and take less than his share of

1053
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:58.08
the gain. This will enhance his reputation and secure for him the good will of all. Do more of

1054
01:26:58.08 --> 01:27:05.36
then your share of work and take less of the share of the gain. Aware of the uncertainties of

1055
01:27:05.36 --> 01:27:11.28
war, the general ought to be ready even after victory to listen to the proposals of the enemy

1056
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:21.12
for peace on advantageous terms. So gotta keep an open mind. The best general is not the man of

1057
01:27:21.12 --> 01:27:30.000
noble family but the man who can take pride in his own deeds. Next, the general must correctly

1058
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:37.36
manage not only matters of immediate concern but most also take thought for the future.

1059
01:27:38.88 --> 01:27:45.20
Common sense. But how often do we see people not doing that? Not thinking about the future.

1060
01:27:45.20 --> 01:27:55.92
Only mean concern with what's happening right now. Next, the best leader is one who does not

1061
01:27:55.92 --> 01:28:02.72
willingly engage in a hazardous and highly uncertain battle and refrains from emulating those who

1062
01:28:02.72 --> 01:28:08.32
carry out operations recklessly and are admired for their brilliant success. But one who,

1063
01:28:08.32 --> 01:28:17.60
while keeping the enemy on the move, remains secure and always in circumstances of his own choosing,

1064
01:28:19.44 --> 01:28:30.96
we dictate the situation. We dictate the situation. A greedy general can be the ruin of his own

1065
01:28:30.96 --> 01:28:43.76
people and an objective contempt to the enemy. A general who loves luxury can destroy the whole army.

1066
01:28:48.24 --> 01:28:54.40
Next, the commander is the one who can instill courage at the right time and can hold back

1067
01:28:54.40 --> 01:29:03.92
the headlong flight of frightened soldiers. Next, a general who desires peace must be prepared for war.

1068
01:29:05.60 --> 01:29:13.12
For the barbarians become very nervous when they face an adversary all set to fight.

1069
01:29:13.12 --> 01:29:22.96
That is why my foreign policy is one word strength because the barbarians get nervous

1070
01:29:24.64 --> 01:29:32.48
when they know you're ready to fight. Mistakes made in ordinary affairs

1071
01:29:33.84 --> 01:29:41.04
can generally be remedied in a short while. But air is made in war caused lasting harm.

1072
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:47.20
This is why combat is like life but amplified and intensified.

1073
01:29:50.24 --> 01:29:55.52
Next, those whose performance is consistently poor should not be entrusted even with just ordinary

1074
01:29:55.52 --> 01:30:06.40
responsibilities. Next, the general, the sharp general takes into account not only probable dangers,

1075
01:30:06.40 --> 01:30:19.44
but also those which may be totally unexpected. Next, make peace a time of training for war

1076
01:30:20.40 --> 01:30:26.000
and battle an exhibition of bravery. So during peace, prepare.

1077
01:30:29.20 --> 01:30:33.68
Next, the general should not go to sleep before reflecting on what he should have done

1078
01:30:33.68 --> 01:30:37.92
that he might have neglected and on what he has to do the next day.

1079
01:30:39.60 --> 01:30:44.64
Get ready for the next day the night before period. Can you do that? Yes, you can.

1080
01:30:45.20 --> 01:30:54.64
That's good to not go just bed without reflecting on it. I think, but it seems like that's something

1081
01:30:54.64 --> 01:30:59.12
that most people probably wouldn't do. Just in life, I mean, you know. Yeah, no, absolutely.

1082
01:30:59.12 --> 01:31:03.68
This is about life. You don't have to put that caveat on there. This is about life.

1083
01:31:04.72 --> 01:31:07.84
Dang, that's a good idea. I mean, shoot, go to bed. It's time to go to bed.

1084
01:31:09.60 --> 01:31:14.24
Whatever, yeah, I got worked on, but you know, you typically don't run. It doesn't take long to say,

1085
01:31:14.24 --> 01:31:18.48
you know what? This is what I got done today. This is what I got done today. And you know what?

1086
01:31:18.48 --> 01:31:22.56
This is something to think about. When it's when you're prepping to get stuff done, when you

1087
01:31:22.56 --> 01:31:27.36
know you got a long day, think about how good it feels when you accomplish a lot in one day.

1088
01:31:27.36 --> 01:31:33.52
That's how you want to go to bed at night. Going, yeah, I nailed this. I nailed this. I nailed this.

1089
01:31:34.32 --> 01:31:39.52
Oh, I messed up this, but I'm gonna get on it tomorrow and fix it. Yeah, that's the part right.

1090
01:31:41.20 --> 01:31:49.36
Doesn't take long. Let you go. Echo is gonna do it. Why won't you do it while you're editing

1091
01:31:49.36 --> 01:31:57.04
videos for this podcast? I do. I like it. I like it. Next, it is well for the

1092
01:31:57.04 --> 01:32:07.76
general to exercise self control at all times, but especially during war. Next, the general should not

1093
01:32:07.76 --> 01:32:13.68
be hasty in placing confidence in people who promise to do something. If he does, almost everyone will

1094
01:32:13.68 --> 01:32:21.36
think he's lightheaded. So you got a, you can't just be, hey, you know you're gonna take care of

1095
01:32:21.36 --> 01:32:30.64
it. Trust you. Gotta, gotta, gotta, check a little bit. Next, long and careful deliberation promises

1096
01:32:30.64 --> 01:32:38.48
great safety in war, whereas hasty and impetuous generals usually commit serious blunders.

1097
01:32:42.48 --> 01:32:46.88
Next, the general should set an example of how things ought to be done for his subordinates,

1098
01:32:46.88 --> 01:32:52.24
training himself in the highest ideals doing what is right and refraining from those things

1099
01:32:52.24 --> 01:33:00.72
his soldiers should refrain from. Set the example. The general should make sure of the good

1100
01:33:00.72 --> 01:33:08.96
disposition of his troops by an oath. Next, if the general knows the inclinations and tendencies

1101
01:33:08.96 --> 01:33:16.64
of each officer and soldier, he will know better what duties should be assigned to each one. No,

1102
01:33:16.64 --> 01:33:25.60
your people. Next, the general who wants to keep his plans concealed from the enemy should never

1103
01:33:25.60 --> 01:33:31.76
take the rank and file his own troops into his confidence. So just be careful. Be careful who you're

1104
01:33:31.76 --> 01:33:42.64
telling him. Does that contradict, you know, having a, well, this transparent transparency in your

1105
01:33:42.64 --> 01:33:49.12
leadership, no, it doesn't. You, you, you don't have to divulge every single idea that you have

1106
01:33:49.12 --> 01:33:53.84
to your entire chain of command. Especially because you're gonna change those ideas, things are

1107
01:33:53.84 --> 01:33:59.68
gonna adapt, things are gonna get different. So this isn't contradictory to say, you know what,

1108
01:33:59.68 --> 01:34:04.16
I'm not gonna tell every single person, especially if you've got a security situation. Right?

1109
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:08.000
I mean, we're talking about national security. Yeah, there's things that are need to know only.

1110
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.92
That's a legitimate thing. Yeah. If echo doesn't need to know this and that can happen in the business

1111
01:34:11.92 --> 01:34:16.88
world too. Because you do have people leaving. You do have spies. You do have all these people

1112
01:34:16.88 --> 01:34:21.68
coming and going from businesses. So this is legit. This isn't, this isn't a lack of transparency.

1113
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:28.56
This is prudent. Yeah. Information control. Yeah, I go home. I tell my wife and she's

1114
01:34:28.56 --> 01:34:32.000
cruising with her neighbor, you know. And they're like, hey, that was interesting. So the

1115
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.16
life goes on tells the husband. I'm putting you know who's putting together all those little dots.

1116
01:34:36.16 --> 01:34:42.24
Yeah. Painting a picture. Next, when both sides are equally well armed, the better

1117
01:34:42.24 --> 01:34:49.20
tactician will win. Next, the general who possesses some skill and public speaking is able

1118
01:34:49.20 --> 01:34:54.96
as in the past to rouse the weak hearted to battle and restore courage to a defeated army.

1119
01:34:54.96 --> 01:35:01.68
Work on those skills. Just like we learned in the in the guide book, the 1950 guide book

1120
01:35:02.40 --> 01:35:06.64
for military officers. Work on your speaking skills. How do you do it practice?

1121
01:35:10.88 --> 01:35:16.88
It is good to occupy any hills in the area before the enemy has a chance to do so.

1122
01:35:16.88 --> 01:35:21.12
Boom. Take the high ground. This is awesome.

1123
01:35:21.12 --> 01:35:31.36
Reinterrated again and again and again take the high ground. Next, as in the past,

1124
01:35:31.36 --> 01:35:37.12
misleading moves taken by the general can be very advantageous. For example, if he makes it look as

1125
01:35:37.12 --> 01:35:40.80
though he's going to set up camp, the enemy might be lowered and doing the same thing.

1126
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:45.84
Then while they're scattered about getting things ready, he may secretly drop his troops in the

1127
01:35:45.84 --> 01:35:53.28
tack where he may quietly withdraw his army if the terrain is unfavorable. Simple. Next,

1128
01:35:54.08 --> 01:36:01.52
in his movements, the general should act like a good wrestler. He should faint in one direction

1129
01:36:01.52 --> 01:36:06.32
to try and deceive his adversary and then make good use of the opportunities he finds.

1130
01:36:06.32 --> 01:36:08.64
And in this way, he will overpower the enemy.

1131
01:36:08.64 --> 01:36:17.04
Same thing with your jutsu by the way. Ready could it flop? I guess he could have said

1132
01:36:17.04 --> 01:36:25.76
penetration. Sure. Next, in battles and in every action against the enemy, the wise general,

1133
01:36:26.16 --> 01:36:32.32
even the most courageous will keep in mind the possibility of failure and defeat.

1134
01:36:32.32 --> 01:36:41.52
And we'll plan for them as actually occurring. You're confident that's great. Plan

1135
01:36:41.52 --> 01:36:45.12
what's going to happen if it fails? What's the worst case scenario? What if things go wrong? What are you

1136
01:36:45.12 --> 01:36:52.56
going to do? The spirit of the commander is naturally communicated to the troops. And there's an

1137
01:36:52.56 --> 01:36:58.56
ancient saying that is better to have an army of deer commanded by a lion than an army of lions

1138
01:36:58.56 --> 01:37:08.32
commanded by a deer. Yeah, that's a pretty common one. Next,

1139
01:37:10.56 --> 01:37:17.28
if you imitate the enemy and do what he is doing for his own benefit, you only harm yourself.

1140
01:37:18.24 --> 01:37:22.96
Conversely, if you do something which is to your advantage and trying to imitate you,

1141
01:37:22.96 --> 01:37:29.84
the enemy will injure himself. A lot of times you do see that in the business world where

1142
01:37:29.84 --> 01:37:36.96
the competitor is something. So we'll do it too. Yeah. I'm not saying that never good, but if you're

1143
01:37:36.96 --> 01:37:42.72
doing that means you're behind. So trying step up, come with some original plans, make something happen.

1144
01:37:45.12 --> 01:37:49.92
Next, a wise commander will not engage the enemy in a pitched battle unless truly exceptional

1145
01:37:49.92 --> 01:37:54.64
opportunity or advantage to present advantage presents itself. We're here in that over and over again.

1146
01:37:56.48 --> 01:38:00.56
Next, whatever terrain the general chooses, he should make his troops familiar with it.

1147
01:38:01.20 --> 01:38:04.72
They will then be able to avoid rough spots and because of their knowledge of the area,

1148
01:38:04.72 --> 01:38:12.08
we'll fight the enemy with confidence. Know your terrain. Next, when the general leads his men out

1149
01:38:12.08 --> 01:38:17.12
to battle, he should present a cheerful and fierce appearance avoiding any gloomy look.

1150
01:38:17.12 --> 01:38:23.44
Soldiers usually estimate their prospects by the appearance of the general. So if you're in a

1151
01:38:23.44 --> 01:38:28.40
leadership position, that's what they're saying. If you're in a leadership position, the people are

1152
01:38:28.40 --> 01:38:33.28
watching you. And if you look like Sullen and Down Trotten, guess what they're going to think

1153
01:38:33.28 --> 01:38:42.80
we're about to get warped. Next, after a victory the general should not allow the men to break ranks

1154
01:38:42.80 --> 01:38:47.76
right away. For his happened often enough that the enemy on noticing that our men have

1155
01:38:47.76 --> 01:38:52.48
let down their guard and rejoicing and have broken ranks, have regained their courage,

1156
01:38:52.48 --> 01:38:56.64
come back to fight and turn to our victory in defeat. Don't let your guard down, boom.

1157
01:38:57.52 --> 01:39:03.44
I think we're here in that loud and clear marise. Next, when the enemies around it is well

1158
01:39:03.44 --> 01:39:08.48
to leave a gap in our lines to give them an opportunity to flee, in case they judge that flight

1159
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:16.72
is better than remaining and taking their chances in battle. Next, an army is judged by the spirit

1160
01:39:16.72 --> 01:39:27.60
of its general. Next, it is better to avoid a tricky opponent than one who never lets up.

1161
01:39:28.96 --> 01:39:35.28
I'm saying that again, it's better to avoid a tricky opponent than one who never lets up. The latter

1162
01:39:35.28 --> 01:39:41.44
makes no secret of what he's doing. Whereas it is difficult to find what the other is up to.

1163
01:39:41.44 --> 01:39:46.32
So, conversely, which one do you want to be? Of course we want to have determination and we never

1164
01:39:46.32 --> 01:39:51.44
want to make sure they know that we're never going to let up, but you really want to be the one

1165
01:39:51.44 --> 01:40:00.88
that keeps him guessing. Yeah. Harder to deal with. Next, the commander should be severe and thorough

1166
01:40:00.88 --> 01:40:06.96
and investigating charges against his men, but merciful in punishing them. This will gain him

1167
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:13.36
in their goodwill. In their goodwill. Next, the generals should be calm and emergencies,

1168
01:40:13.36 --> 01:40:19.68
prudent and counsel, courteous to his associates. He will be most successful in battle if he

1169
01:40:19.68 --> 01:40:25.68
charges against the enemy, not like a wild beast, but in a calculated manner.

1170
01:40:25.68 --> 01:40:37.12
Next, the general should be ignorant of none of the situations likely to occur in war.

1171
01:40:38.64 --> 01:40:43.04
Who can attempt to accomplish what he does not understand?

1172
01:40:43.84 --> 01:40:48.56
Now, that again, who can attempt to accomplish what he does not understand?

1173
01:40:48.56 --> 01:40:54.72
Who is able to furnish assistance in situation whose dangers he does not understand?

1174
01:40:56.32 --> 01:41:04.08
So, you gotta get the knowledge. Next, the general must make plans to defeat the enemy,

1175
01:41:04.72 --> 01:41:10.96
not only by arms, but also through their food and drink,

1176
01:41:10.96 --> 01:41:23.20
making the water unfit to drink and poisoning the grain. And that's, again, we're not just attacking

1177
01:41:23.20 --> 01:41:30.72
on one front. We're attacking on all the fronts. We're not just attacking with swords and bows

1178
01:41:30.72 --> 01:41:35.28
and arrows and lances. We're poisoning the water. We're poisoning the grain. We're attacking at

1179
01:41:35.28 --> 01:41:46.88
every possible angle. And that wraps it up. That's Marisa's strategic con and, by the way,

1180
01:41:46.88 --> 01:41:50.000
I forgot to mention this. This is somebody, somebody on Twitter said,

1181
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.92
hey, check out this book. I got it opened up and said, yes, ancient war, bring it,

1182
01:41:57.92 --> 01:42:07.04
maximums, bring it, awesome book. And, you know, I wanted to close this out kind of with something

1183
01:42:09.68 --> 01:42:16.08
Roman related. And, of course, I thought about Julius. When you think of Rome, you think of

1184
01:42:16.08 --> 01:42:22.88
Julius Caesar, you think of Julius Caesar, you think about that guy named Shakespeare, who wrote

1185
01:42:22.88 --> 01:42:30.08
a play called Julius Caesar. And, obviously, not going to do the whole thing right now, but there's a

1186
01:42:32.48 --> 01:42:40.80
part of it. And, you know, we're talking about leadership, right? And, really, in talking about

1187
01:42:40.80 --> 01:42:46.72
Marisa and Caesar, actual rulers of an empire. That's where they were rulers of an empire.

1188
01:42:46.72 --> 01:42:57.68
It's possible to think that maybe they were better than us, right? Like, they were superior human beings.

1189
01:42:59.92 --> 01:43:06.80
And, it's also possible to think that they were better than us, not by what they did.

1190
01:43:08.08 --> 01:43:12.96
And, how old they led? It's possible to say, oh, you know, Marisa came up with this stuff.

1191
01:43:12.96 --> 01:43:18.56
Nah, that's just, that's not why he was the ruler. This is luck to fate.

1192
01:43:21.84 --> 01:43:32.80
But, in the play, Julius Caesar by Shakespeare, Cassius reminds us as he speaks to Brutus that

1193
01:43:32.80 --> 01:43:42.64
that isn't so. And not so, not luck. He explains to Caesar, in these great lines, he explains

1194
01:43:42.64 --> 01:43:52.40
him that Caesar stands above the world like a giant. So, Caesar's a giant, like a Colossus,

1195
01:43:52.40 --> 01:44:01.68
is the word he uses. While we, us down here, we little men, we just wonder about, wonder about

1196
01:44:01.68 --> 01:44:09.92
under his massive legs under his giant presence. We're just, we're just moving angiously towards a,

1197
01:44:11.44 --> 01:44:20.24
toward that, towards a dishonorable death. But, this is what I like about it. Then, Cassius explains

1198
01:44:20.24 --> 01:44:30.32
that it isn't fate that has put Caesar into that powerful position. But, that men,

1199
01:44:32.48 --> 01:44:45.28
men control their own destinies. And, that men are masters of their fate. And, that the fault

1200
01:44:45.28 --> 01:44:53.44
in men, the thing that holds us back from greatness, it doesn't lie in chance. It doesn't

1201
01:44:53.44 --> 01:45:07.76
lie in the way that the stars are aligned. No. The fault lies within us. Not in the stars. It is

1202
01:45:07.76 --> 01:45:20.80
our fault that we become slaves instead of kings. And, this is, this is how Shakespeare put it.

1203
01:45:24.80 --> 01:45:37.12
Why? Man, he, Doth, bestried the narrow world like a Colossus. And, we, petty men, walk under his huge legs

1204
01:45:37.12 --> 01:45:49.04
and people about to find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men, at some time, are masters of their

1205
01:45:49.04 --> 01:46:06.80
fate. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. That we are underlings.

1206
01:46:06.80 --> 01:46:19.60
So, Cassius, there, is making an early case for ownership, for extreme ownership, which is

1207
01:46:19.60 --> 01:46:27.92
obviously something that I believe in. Then, that is, that you can't blame fate. You can't blame

1208
01:46:27.92 --> 01:46:38.16
the stars. The fault lies within us. And, you got to own it. You got to own that fault. You

1209
01:46:38.16 --> 01:46:46.80
got to fix it. You got to dictate your own future. Don't let fate dictate your future.

1210
01:46:46.80 --> 01:46:59.20
You got to make that decision to be better, to be a king like Caesar, to be a general,

1211
01:47:01.52 --> 01:47:09.92
to be a leader. Then, most, most important to be a free human being. So, we're talking

1212
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:20.96
about underlings. There's slaves. Don't be a slave. Be a slave to any other man and don't be

1213
01:47:20.96 --> 01:47:35.84
a slave to weakness and don't be a slave to sloth and don't be a slave to your ego. Don't be a slave

1214
01:47:35.84 --> 01:47:45.84
be free, free your mind. And, the thing is, you can't free your mind until you realize,

1215
01:47:47.28 --> 01:47:55.52
the Cassius says, the fault is in ourselves. And, the pathway to overcoming our faults is not

1216
01:47:55.52 --> 01:48:09.36
complaining or blaming or making excuses or attacking others. No. The pathway to freedom actually

1217
01:48:09.36 --> 01:48:18.56
comes from attacking ourselves, attacking ourselves with discipline and with hard work and with

1218
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:29.52
physical training and mental training and then reading and studying and learning. Then that, that is how

1219
01:48:32.56 --> 01:48:39.84
we overcome those faults. That's how we leave behind the underlings, the slaves.

1220
01:48:39.84 --> 01:48:57.28
That's how we get away from the darkness of subjugation. And that is how we become free.

1221
01:48:57.28 --> 01:49:13.84
And I think that's all I've got for tonight looks like we're pretty long to slide into Q&A right now.

1222
01:49:13.84 --> 01:49:33.28
So echo. Yes, if we are not going to do Q&A, I have a question. If people wanted to support

1223
01:49:33.28 --> 01:49:37.92
this podcast, do you know of any ways that they could do that? I do as a matter of fact, let me go

1224
01:49:37.92 --> 01:49:48.32
and tell you about it. People have been asking me, and not to kind of, you know,

1225
01:49:48.32 --> 01:49:53.20
how like some people they'll say that, they'll be like, hey, people, a lot of people been asking

1226
01:49:53.20 --> 01:49:58.32
me about this, but it's like two people, you know, and they say a lot of people. So not that case,

1227
01:49:58.32 --> 01:50:04.16
there's a lot of people, probably like 20 people, which is a lot of people asking the same question,

1228
01:50:04.16 --> 01:50:10.80
but I think people asking the same question. So anyway, they're like, hey, what supplements or

1229
01:50:10.80 --> 01:50:16.40
are these on at camp, on am talking about on it? So the supplements, the krill oil, is that

1230
01:50:16.40 --> 01:50:22.56
the good stuff, is the true tech, is that the good stuff? And I was like, cool, yeah, yeah, they're

1231
01:50:22.56 --> 01:50:26.40
they're the good stuff for whatever, but so you kind of think, and I was thinking about this one,

1232
01:50:26.40 --> 01:50:33.36
I was actually working out, and I was like, hey, to myself. It's not like the supplements you take

1233
01:50:33.36 --> 01:50:40.16
aren't going to like get you in jocquishate, you know? It's going to be like all the other stuff,

1234
01:50:40.16 --> 01:50:45.92
like Jimmy and hard work. Yeah, it's exactly, you know, the workout, diet, rest, like all this stuff.

1235
01:50:46.56 --> 01:50:52.32
And if you have like, you know, whatever goal, the supplements are going to like, they're going to

1236
01:50:52.32 --> 01:50:56.96
help you get there faster, they're going to create less roadblocks, like injuries all this stuff,

1237
01:50:56.96 --> 01:51:03.60
keep you, put you and or keep you in better health, like all this stuff, right? But the way I kind

1238
01:51:03.60 --> 01:51:08.80
I don't know, I could have been taking it wrong though, that it sounded like they were like, oh yeah,

1239
01:51:08.80 --> 01:51:13.52
I'm looking for like the answer kind of thing, not all of them, but that's kind of, I don't know,

1240
01:51:13.52 --> 01:51:17.12
maybe it was just collectively, that's what it felt like. Yeah. So I think that's important to point out.

1241
01:51:17.12 --> 01:51:22.56
So supplements are not the answer. Yeah. Your squat rack is the answer. Yeah.

1242
01:51:22.56 --> 01:51:28.000
Yeah. Your pull-up bar is the answer. Yeah. And you got to do that stuff like over and over and over.

1243
01:51:28.64 --> 01:51:34.48
Like, you know how, okay, I'm not going to mention this name, but one of my friends would be like,

1244
01:51:34.48 --> 01:51:39.20
yeah, you're like your a genetic guy, whatever, you know, those be like, yeah, a genetic, your genetics are

1245
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:45.20
like good. And I'm not saying my genetics are not good. I'm not going to say they are or are not,

1246
01:51:45.20 --> 01:51:49.60
I'm not saying that. But I got into like working out when I was 14 years old.

1247
01:51:49.60 --> 01:51:56.32
I didn't stop by the way, new about like diet and all this other stuff. So when you hit, let's say,

1248
01:51:56.32 --> 01:52:01.20
let's say you had not started working out when you're 14. Let's say you were like, oh, you know,

1249
01:52:01.20 --> 01:52:06.32
I know what a weight room is kind of thing. I'm out of shape. I'm 35 or whatever, however old.

1250
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:12.000
And to say, I want to get in good shape, it's like that's a completely different situation, you know?

1251
01:52:12.96 --> 01:52:19.36
Yeah. And you could possibly try and blame the fault on your genetics, but it's not the fault of

1252
01:52:19.36 --> 01:52:25.28
your genetics. Exactly. The fault of the star is baby. No fault of yours. Yeah. So you can work out now.

1253
01:52:25.28 --> 01:52:30.96
You could say, man, it was an environment. Okay. Cool. It doesn't matter anymore. Right. What matters

1254
01:52:30.96 --> 01:52:36.96
is how you know, fix? Yeah, what are we going to do exactly right. So which brings us to the same kind of

1255
01:52:36.96 --> 01:52:43.84
this profound, maybe fundamental concept of it's not like it's not these external things.

1256
01:52:43.84 --> 01:52:49.28
You're not going to escape the fact that if you wanted to get in shape, you got to go get in shape.

1257
01:52:49.28 --> 01:52:53.84
And that entails these fundamental things. It's not going to be the supplements. It's not going to be

1258
01:52:53.84 --> 01:52:58.48
your genetics, the supplements, genetics, all this stuff. That's part of the game. For sure.

1259
01:52:58.48 --> 01:53:03.44
But that's not what's going to get you there. So that being said, I'm going to recommend some

1260
01:53:03.44 --> 01:53:12.48
supplements. But in the hopes of us, everybody, being on a good workout program. Yes.

1261
01:53:12.48 --> 01:53:19.12
These will help you if you are on a good workout program. By the way, these will definitely help you.

1262
01:53:19.12 --> 01:53:25.52
Yeah. And a lot of people speaking of, again, a lot of people I don't mean to. I mean more than

1263
01:53:26.88 --> 01:53:31.52
two. I mean, I think about all the people on Twitter that I said, I've been taking

1264
01:53:31.52 --> 01:53:35.28
acrylic oil. Yes. My knees feel better now. Oh, my shoulders feel better. That's a fact.

1265
01:53:35.28 --> 01:53:41.76
acrylic, acrylic, acrylic works. Yeah. And personally, however many people told me that it worked for them,

1266
01:53:41.76 --> 01:53:47.20
that has no bearing on my understanding that it works because it works for me. And I don't take

1267
01:53:47.20 --> 01:53:52.48
like protein, massive gainer to get big, I don't do that. You can, I guess. And that's cool.

1268
01:53:52.48 --> 01:53:57.84
And I'm not going to recommend necessarily that. But like, acrylic oil, for example,

1269
01:53:57.84 --> 01:54:04.48
like that will keep you in the game way more in my opinion than it will. Like a creatine situation.

1270
01:54:04.48 --> 01:54:09.84
I think that. I agree with you. This is, and you're, by the way, for those of you don't know,

1271
01:54:10.24 --> 01:54:17.20
echo does have a doctorate in neuroscience. Yes. Well, you, you, you, you notice. I won't make any

1272
01:54:17.84 --> 01:54:24.40
scientific claims. Yes. Or maybe I will. I don't know. Okay. Well, the best claim you can make is

1273
01:54:24.80 --> 01:54:31.36
that you use it and you feel it. That's, yeah. You know, that is, bro science, I guess. Yes.

1274
01:54:31.36 --> 01:54:35.76
What's anecdotal. Yeah. anecdotal. But what if it works for me, too? Yeah. There you go.

1275
01:54:35.76 --> 01:54:39.44
There you go. Then we're starting to paint that picture with the dots. Remember how you're talking about?

1276
01:54:39.44 --> 01:54:44.64
Yes. Yeah. Same thing. And, and I do want to add that this, that does mean something when I say

1277
01:54:44.64 --> 01:54:49.84
it works for me because I was for a long time time anti-supplements. We're,

1278
01:54:49.84 --> 01:54:54.40
like, yeah, you're just taking that to make yourself feel better about working out or whatever.

1279
01:54:54.40 --> 01:54:58.64
And they're selling it to you because they're telling you the same thing. For long time,

1280
01:54:58.64 --> 01:55:02.48
they take any supplements and still had gains and all, you know, who's doing fine?

1281
01:55:02.48 --> 01:55:08.56
Gaines. Big time, I can't. So I was like, yeah, supplements. You know, when people talk about

1282
01:55:08.56 --> 01:55:13.68
supplements, they grow, you're totally wasting your time because you can just eat good and eating

1283
01:55:13.68 --> 01:55:18.72
enough of the right thing and then do everything that you're on top of is that true. You can't do that.

1284
01:55:18.72 --> 01:55:23.36
Yeah. But here's the thing. I don't know if you can do that with krill oil unless you're eating

1285
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:28.96
a bunch of krill in a smoothie or something. Even that, I don't know. You know, do can you? Shrimp tech.

1286
01:55:28.96 --> 01:55:34.88
How can you replace that with diet? I don't know if you can, man. So I'm slowly, and this is what it was.

1287
01:55:34.88 --> 01:55:40.24
It was like the correct kind of supplements. Yeah. That's what it is. So krill oil, take care of your joints.

1288
01:55:41.36 --> 01:55:45.04
Other ones that you take your course, you know, strong and bone. Yeah. You're a course, man.

1289
01:55:45.04 --> 01:55:52.08
Don't. Shrimp tech, if you want a little efficient oxygen usage, you know, keep you in that

1290
01:55:52.08 --> 01:55:57.68
those hard workouts longer, better, more comfortable. Get you in the, like in the car, the RPMs,

1291
01:55:57.68 --> 01:56:00.72
you know what goes, it's in the black and goes into. We know. Yeah. I know.

1292
01:56:00.72 --> 01:56:04.72
I know. Because I told you to tell us it's in the time. Tell us it's in the time. Tell us what the slogan is,

1293
01:56:04.72 --> 01:56:10.000
you can't pull ahead if you're in the red. So the shrimp tech keeps you in the like the yellow

1294
01:56:10.72 --> 01:56:20.08
main bit orange. Anyway. The other day, shrimp tech, I took, we, we showed up to train and it was the kind of

1295
01:56:20.08 --> 01:56:24.000
the, the pipeting training partners, you know, the guys that the big dog, yeah, the big dogs.

1296
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:32.72
And before I went, before I went, I'd work out as normal. Yeah. Yeah. But I took,

1297
01:56:32.72 --> 01:56:40.16
not only did I take shrimp tech sport, I also took the pre workout drink. Yeah. What is it called?

1298
01:56:40.16 --> 01:56:46.24
Earth groan. Yeah. Earth groan. Yeah. Earth groan. It's pre workout. Yeah. And I took both and we did

1299
01:56:46.24 --> 01:56:51.52
10 rounds. You know, 10 rounds. That's 10, five minutes. Where were we? We were five minutes

1300
01:56:51.52 --> 01:56:56.88
rounds because I was training MMA fighters. So, but it's 10. One hour. Yeah. And it's only over an hour

1301
01:56:56.88 --> 01:57:03.68
of training. I was going to, you showed it. Wait. No, I was adding. Okay. For that one. Yeah. But I walked

1302
01:57:03.68 --> 01:57:10.72
out of there going. True tech. True tech. Yeah. Well, we, 10 rounds is hard core. Yeah. When you're going

1303
01:57:10.72 --> 01:57:15.20
with no, because, but you can do around with three hard guys. And then you go again, someone that's not

1304
01:57:15.20 --> 01:57:18.24
that great. You can, yeah, it's neatly relaxed and recover. But yeah, it's so back to different

1305
01:57:18.24 --> 01:57:21.92
things. But when you are going against every guy is trying to rip your head off and they have

1306
01:57:21.92 --> 01:57:27.44
the capability of you in it. 10 rounds and a lot of rounds. Yeah. So the shrimp tech. And the feeling

1307
01:57:27.44 --> 01:57:31.60
there is because I've been in the same boat. Uh, I'm not going to necessarily say 10 rounds, but

1308
01:57:31.60 --> 01:57:36.64
in the same boat. Where? There's a lot of rounds for a curve. Actually, I've done six, 10s,

1309
01:57:36.64 --> 01:57:41.60
six, 10 minutes. And it might be hard. Yeah. Been some, but some might consider. Yeah. With

1310
01:57:41.60 --> 01:57:49.04
heavy hitters. Heavy hitters. Yeah. That's tiring. Yes. So basically what the shrimp tech will do is

1311
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:54.32
put in the layman's turn. What it'll do is, you know, the feeling, let's say you go six tenths.

1312
01:57:54.32 --> 01:57:58.40
Well, actually, can you do scientific terms for us here? No, I'm going to layman. Thank you.

1313
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.84
After the sixth tenth or the one hour of rolling, you're going to be like, physically, you know,

1314
01:58:05.84 --> 01:58:12.16
like, dang, I'm done. That felt good. Whatever. But we're done. I'm good. I'm going to go home on a

1315
01:58:12.16 --> 01:58:19.76
rest. He might stuff him good. Yeah. And even today, when I showed up today to roll, we had some,

1316
01:58:19.76 --> 01:58:23.28
we didn't do anything that extreme, but when I showed up, I already worked out hard,

1317
01:58:24.64 --> 01:58:30.64
strength and metcon. Then I went surfing, you know, getting after it. Sure.

1318
01:58:30.64 --> 01:58:35.20
For any, didn't eat anything, but just rolled in. Now I had some, I had to take that back. I had

1319
01:58:35.20 --> 01:58:42.08
some bacon, like three pieces of bacon. In between working out and surfing, so I was like,

1320
01:58:42.08 --> 01:58:48.40
we had some bacon. Sure. Then I had some shrimp tech. I showed him to hand it on the way to the

1321
01:58:48.40 --> 01:58:54.64
gym. I drank the, the pre-workout stuff. Yeah. And I felt ready to rock and roll. Yeah.

1322
01:58:54.64 --> 01:58:58.64
Well, I'm actually, instead of me saying I was ready to rock and roll, why don't you answer that?

1323
01:58:58.64 --> 01:59:04.72
I was. Jocco appeared and demonstrated that he was ready to rock and roll as it were.

1324
01:59:04.72 --> 01:59:08.56
I actually wasn't ready to actually did rock and roll. Yes. Which is, which is, yeah. You were,

1325
01:59:08.56 --> 01:59:14.96
you didn't talk about it. You beat about it. Yeah. I beat about it. Afterwards, after the hard rolls,

1326
01:59:15.36 --> 01:59:21.04
with the shrimp tech, you'll feel like, sure. Yeah. That was good. That was hard. I could go another one.

1327
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:24.64
Like, I could keep going. Just tell you feel, not necessarily that you want to keep going,

1328
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:28.88
but you could, you feel like you could. Yeah. I mean, I wanted to go get a wheel to podcast.

1329
01:59:29.60 --> 01:59:33.04
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a different. But, you know, I get it. Anyway, yeah,

1330
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:37.68
shrimp tech, that's a good on shrimp tech sport. Still haven't didn't done shrimp tech immune.

1331
01:59:37.68 --> 01:59:44.08
I think that's the next one. Yeah. Warrior bars and okay. So we'll talk about that pre-workout one.

1332
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:50.32
And I took it one time for rolling and I was like, okay, cool, but I'd been taking it all week

1333
01:59:50.32 --> 01:59:57.92
for lifting working out at cons. Very, very good. Very effective. Okay. And here's the,

1334
01:59:57.92 --> 02:00:04.16
the, the, the, the, the, really the results. The proof straight up proof. He's right. So,

1335
02:00:04.16 --> 02:00:08.96
you know how like, okay, do you do, do you do any kind of like pressing or are you all any kind of

1336
02:00:08.96 --> 02:00:13.52
lifting, you've been pull ups or something? You know how some days you're like, oh, I feel like flat. I can still do

1337
02:00:13.52 --> 02:00:17.92
but I feel flat. Yeah. Then some days up, I said, where you like, oh my god, a little pop in my thing.

1338
02:00:17.92 --> 02:00:22.96
Not necessarily stronger or doing more. Maybe you are, but I just got a little pop in it.

1339
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:28.32
In my, my movement or whatever. That's how you feel. And it was noticeable. And I was like, okay,

1340
02:00:28.32 --> 02:00:34.16
and here's the thing with mine, I did do more. More weight than I normally do. More reps than I normally do.

1341
02:00:34.16 --> 02:00:37.36
But I was like, okay, those are the first sales. I go, okay. You know, like, easily could have been

1342
02:00:37.36 --> 02:00:43.44
other circumstances. Totally could. Yeah, because sometimes you just feel the pop feel the pot. You got more rest.

1343
02:00:43.44 --> 02:00:47.68
You know, you guess your day was, you know, easier out on whatever. All these other circumstances. You know,

1344
02:00:47.68 --> 02:00:52.72
everyone else. So boom. Next time I lift do it again. Same pop, same feeling. It's like, okay.

1345
02:00:53.04 --> 02:00:58.40
And that's different. Typically, you don't get two pops in a week. Anyway, next time I go, I go in again. I'm like,

1346
02:00:58.40 --> 02:01:03.76
all right, we're going to keep this going. Who's the telltale? So here's what happened. So I warm up.

1347
02:01:03.76 --> 02:01:10.40
My routine is I warm up. I work out. That's it. I warm up and I have my son and he needs

1348
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:16.56
something without going to for a minute. I warm up ready to go. Ready to go first set. He needs

1349
02:01:16.56 --> 02:01:23.12
something for half an hour. Oh my, okay. You know, I go. So do I have to warm up again? And my, you know,

1350
02:01:23.12 --> 02:01:30.72
am I going to? Did you utilize the pop to care for your son? No. No, what I'm saying is kind of physiologically

1351
02:01:30.72 --> 02:01:35.68
mentally, I'm out of, I went out of the game for a little bit out of the workout. So I come back.

1352
02:01:35.68 --> 02:01:42.48
I got a re-engagementally and I'm fit to be honest, like mental. I should kind of flat back in the day

1353
02:01:42.48 --> 02:01:48.40
that might have possible nowhere to go tomorrow. Back in the day. Anyway, so I'm like, all right,

1354
02:01:49.36 --> 02:01:53.36
I'm a little bit flat whatever. I choose I'm working out today. That's it. You know, whatever.

1355
02:01:54.80 --> 02:01:58.32
Maybe I had a warm up again. I don't know. Maybe he's going to get mentally harder.

1356
02:01:58.32 --> 02:02:04.56
Oh, first sure. Yeah, that's no question about that. You know, is that? So whatever I get under there,

1357
02:02:04.56 --> 02:02:10.64
I choose the weight that I had already showed you know, chose before when I was like, I'm, I'm in it.

1358
02:02:10.64 --> 02:02:17.52
Yeah. Boom, boom, boom, more reps than I expected. It was a winning day. That's good.

1359
02:02:18.24 --> 02:02:24.40
Three in a row. Anyway, that was it. So I didn't like some strong. Well, I'm in. It's to me. That's

1360
02:02:24.40 --> 02:02:27.84
for like, okay, even if you use a scientific proof for not scientific proof. Of course,

1361
02:02:27.84 --> 02:02:32.48
not scientific proof. But that's like to me, that says, okay, this is something you're going to be

1362
02:02:32.48 --> 02:02:36.64
taken now. You know what I mean? It's not like I tried it. No different. I'll try to get

1363
02:02:36.64 --> 02:02:41.76
sort of what the media did. Sort of what the 10 rounds give me. Yeah, you're on. You're in.

1364
02:02:41.76 --> 02:02:46.000
Okay. Yeah. You know what I did today? Turgut again. Turgut again. Turgut again.

1365
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:51.12
There you go. You know, and actually we had some no shows today at the gym. Yeah. I don't know.

1366
02:02:51.12 --> 02:02:55.92
I wasn't one of those. So yeah, you were there. I was there. But we had some other heavy hitters there.

1367
02:02:55.92 --> 02:03:01.68
But we didn't get the full spectrum of heavy hitters that were there to crush. So I didn't even need to

1368
02:03:01.68 --> 02:03:07.92
take it. Yeah. It didn't get put to the test. No. Okay. It's good. So now I'm kind of in a way. I'm

1369
02:03:07.92 --> 02:03:12.96
a supplement guy. Okay. So if people wanted to get these supplements, how could they get them?

1370
02:03:12.96 --> 02:03:20.16
All right. On it.com. You want 10% off? You go to on dot com slash jockel. You want to 10% off.

1371
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:26.24
Support yourself. Support the podcast if you're in the mood to and you know, go handle your business.

1372
02:03:26.24 --> 02:03:33.68
Another cool way Amazon click through. So Sarah, thanks for the duct tape. I want to say that all

1373
02:03:33.68 --> 02:03:38.80
the duct I have like a pilot duct tape too, which is not a good tier. By the way,

1374
02:03:38.80 --> 02:03:44.32
no, because I needed it. She sent it. My phone's yeah. Well, there's smiley faces on it.

1375
02:03:44.32 --> 02:03:50.08
Okay. It can't be on the podcast. But this is smiley face. You know, now the new iPhones,

1376
02:03:50.08 --> 02:03:56.72
you type a word and it suggests emoji. So you type in good guess what's right there?

1377
02:03:57.36 --> 02:04:03.84
It's my face. Should be your face. But now the smiley face currently. Slack HQ has that for some reason.

1378
02:04:03.84 --> 02:04:07.52
Yeah. My face or someone I don't really understand it fully, but somebody sent me a little

1379
02:04:07.52 --> 02:04:12.80
picture of an emoji that said good and it's my. Yeah. Yeah. So it's kind of the same concept.

1380
02:04:12.80 --> 02:04:18.88
But generally speaking, it's a smiley face smiley face went on the duct tape layers.

1381
02:04:18.88 --> 02:04:25.20
She's the same. And like the ones it's good duct. Good duct tape. But emoji style. You know,

1382
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:33.28
Sarah's she's clever like that. Anyway, the point is Amazon if you're shot never duct tape or anything else.

1383
02:04:33.28 --> 02:04:37.28
Not necessarily duct tape, but like books, you know, you want to get this one or whatever.

1384
02:04:37.28 --> 02:04:39.68
And we list that on the website too. But if you didn't already, you know,

1385
02:04:40.64 --> 02:04:44.88
click through. Go to the website.jockelpodcast.com. Click through the Amazon banner

1386
02:04:44.88 --> 02:04:49.60
over there on the side and then do your shopping and support by casselle. You said

1387
02:04:50.64 --> 02:04:56.40
small click like it takes like two seconds. Right. Click on it. Go do your shopping. Two seconds

1388
02:04:56.40 --> 02:05:01.92
supports, you know, like a big amount. Well, because it's a lot more than just you. Yeah. Clicking. Like just

1389
02:05:01.92 --> 02:05:05.60
one. It's not just one person clicking. Yeah. Which would be helpful. But when a bunch of people

1390
02:05:05.60 --> 02:05:11.60
click through, then it's very helpful. Yeah. Create a bigger reaction. Yeah. So small action, huge reaction.

1391
02:05:11.60 --> 02:05:17.84
And I made the reference to when you throw a small piece of sodium metal in a, you know, in water

1392
02:05:17.84 --> 02:05:22.16
and the big chemical reaction. Something like, wait, did I remember that crack? I looked up on

1393
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:27.28
YouTube. Look up. So put sodium in water. Look that up. So you get guys, they'll, they'll have a big

1394
02:05:27.28 --> 02:05:31.60
fish tank with water. They'll throw the sodium and the fish tank will blow up. So people posted them

1395
02:05:31.60 --> 02:05:37.44
on Twitter. Did you see that one where somebody had a, somebody's holding a small brick of sodium.

1396
02:05:37.44 --> 02:05:42.64
Oh, yeah. Through the lake. Did you see that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. I'll leave it.

1397
02:05:42.64 --> 02:05:47.84
Yeah. So see I get that exactly. Right. So when you, next time you shop Amazon, you think,

1398
02:05:47.84 --> 02:05:52.56
I'm shopping Amazon. I'm going to buy some batteries. That little click through the

1399
02:05:52.56 --> 02:05:58.80
Jockel podcast.com. Boom. That's that sodium that we're looking at on those videos. It's crazy.

1400
02:05:59.76 --> 02:06:05.68
Anyway, that's a good way to support in a big way. And then yeah. So YouTube, that's a good one.

1401
02:06:05.68 --> 02:06:11.12
Right. Subscribe to the YouTube channel. Subscribe to the iTunes one as well. But that one seems kind

1402
02:06:11.12 --> 02:06:15.68
of obvious. Most people already subscribed. But if you haven't, well, we went over an entire book today

1403
02:06:15.68 --> 02:06:20.88
of obvious things that people don't always know myself. So we need to reiterate just so we all

1404
02:06:21.52 --> 02:06:26.80
make sure we're on board. Yeah. Reinforce with our friends. Yeah. Yes. That you should always be prepared.

1405
02:06:26.80 --> 02:06:30.72
Yeah. Oh, we would have prepared. Yeah. Really. That one was all about prepared. Yes. Subscribe.

1406
02:06:30.72 --> 02:06:35.84
iTunes. Subscribe. Be a subscriber to the podcast. And that's no commitment. You just unsubscribe. If you

1407
02:06:35.84 --> 02:06:40.16
you don't like what Jockel's talking about, you just unsubscribe. But if you like and you do want to

1408
02:06:40.16 --> 02:06:43.92
support. I don't like it. You're talking about that too. You know that too.

1409
02:06:45.28 --> 02:06:53.20
It's a rumor. There's a part. YouTube. Luckily you don't dog a lot. Yeah. I sure. You don't like

1410
02:06:53.20 --> 02:06:59.20
that. Sometimes you just suck it up. Fast forward. It's a nice old line. Yeah. And most people

1411
02:06:59.20 --> 02:07:02.96
like now you're pretty screwed. Yeah. Yeah. You've never long long. You're a little bit

1412
02:07:02.96 --> 02:07:06.80
older. Just listening to echo. They're like fast forwarding through me. Yeah. You press the

1413
02:07:06.80 --> 02:07:09.76
skips. Okay. Oh, I can. Echoes about to say something. So don't.

1414
02:07:12.80 --> 02:07:23.28
Nope. The one guy. My mom or something. Anyway. YouTube. We do more videos now. We put out the little

1415
02:07:23.28 --> 02:07:28.64
the shareable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My husband. My brother the other days. I like hey, this new guy.

1416
02:07:28.64 --> 02:07:32.88
You know, he listens to a lot of like talks and stuff. Like, new guys talking about this. I'm like,

1417
02:07:32.88 --> 02:07:36.72
oh, that's good. He's like, hey, he's talking about he goes into these little ideas that he's talking.

1418
02:07:36.72 --> 02:07:40.96
I was like, oh, I was like, hey, send that to me. And I usually want to say I'll be like, cool.

1419
02:07:41.68 --> 02:07:45.76
Maybe I'll look into it kind of thing. And I'm like, does this one song that I said send it to me?

1420
02:07:45.76 --> 02:07:49.36
Send it to me. Send it to me. It's an hour 37 minutes. You don't want? I'm like, bro, I would. Yeah.

1421
02:07:49.36 --> 02:07:54.24
And I scolded him. I said, but you can't do that to me. We got him to like, so now you're going to have everyone

1422
02:07:54.24 --> 02:07:59.76
that listen, scolding you. Yeah, but not anymore. You know why? Because we have juggle me. Now it's three minutes.

1423
02:07:59.76 --> 02:08:06.48
You want to learn about how to learn necessarily, but yeah, learn. If you want advice, good advice,

1424
02:08:06.48 --> 02:08:12.48
juggle advice. On what, how you should approach college after the military after high school,

1425
02:08:12.48 --> 02:08:17.68
whatever. Go ahead and listen to that three, four minutes. Boom. You're good to go. You're ready.

1426
02:08:17.68 --> 02:08:23.76
Go to college. Great. A function. If you say, hey, listen to this podcast, it's in there somewhere. Two hours long.

1427
02:08:24.64 --> 02:08:30.80
No. Any lot of people don't have the attention span for that. And but it's, but you do other ones besides just college.

1428
02:08:30.80 --> 02:08:36.08
Exactly. Right. We do multiple. Yes. Well, Nick. No. I do suggestion. Like a 20 pack of Nick nuggets.

1429
02:08:37.92 --> 02:08:42.64
More than that. Be really. And you know, you can share and consume, you know, boom, boom,

1430
02:08:42.64 --> 02:08:47.84
I do suggestions as well. Request, if you will. People on Twitter, they're like, hey,

1431
02:08:47.84 --> 02:08:54.48
chocolate podcast. What does it take to actually make that come true? It's not 100% turnover.

1432
02:08:54.48 --> 02:08:59.84
See, people don't like that. I know. And reliable. It's quite a response and say, yes or no.

1433
02:09:01.68 --> 02:09:07.68
Kind of. Yeah. I don't say yes or no. Like, yes, I'm going to do that one. I'm, I just noted, you know,

1434
02:09:07.68 --> 02:09:13.76
so yeah, I mean, they're all good. I know. But when they see them boom, there it is. Yeah. You should actually tell them.

1435
02:09:13.76 --> 02:09:19.92
But I know it might be hard. Maybe because you're going to lose track of them all. Yeah. Maybe. Or maybe you should just do them all.

1436
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:26.72
Oh, yeah. Maybe there it is. I think that's that. But yes. So, you know, there's no downside, right? There's no downside

1437
02:09:27.76 --> 02:09:32.24
to doing them all. To do, no, to doing a blood. There's, is there a downside to saying, making a bunch of them?

1438
02:09:32.24 --> 02:09:38.000
There's not unless you make ones that are lame, right? Unless you pick out a lame one when I'm talking

1439
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.28
about something stupid or making mistakes, yeah, or giving bad advice to the world. Yeah. Don't do those.

1440
02:09:43.28 --> 02:09:48.88
Those are the good downside for sure. The good ones. Yeah. No downside. Okay. There you go.

1441
02:09:48.88 --> 02:09:55.84
And when you subscribe, boom, you have like, because I subscribe. Yeah. And when you upload something,

1442
02:09:55.84 --> 02:09:59.04
you don't tell me. Right. I just get a lame. Hell that says,

1443
02:09:59.04 --> 02:10:06.48
jocopotka's just uploaded a video and I was go, wow. Yes. Echo has been hard at work for

1444
02:10:06.48 --> 02:10:15.44
four minutes to make a video. Anyway, it's good to, um, I'm taking heavy stitch for me. I'm sorry.

1445
02:10:16.16 --> 02:10:21.60
All day, but all good though. I think I'll for brain some solid. I think,

1446
02:10:21.60 --> 02:10:28.64
uh, yeah. So, subscribe to subscribe if you're in the mood, subscribe to YouTube if you like that stuff.

1447
02:10:29.44 --> 02:10:32.48
We just go. Um, and then of course,

1448
02:10:33.76 --> 02:10:39.28
jocco has a store. It's called jocco store. Your L is jocco store.

1449
02:10:39.28 --> 02:10:47.04
.com. Anyway, shirts, you like these slogans. The slogan is that a lame word for like discipline equals freedom.

1450
02:10:47.04 --> 02:10:53.84
I don't know. I think it's, I think it's, I think it's actually, what it could be used, but I don't

1451
02:10:53.84 --> 02:10:59.12
know that it necessarily. I'm not waving it around and jumping up and down. Yeah.

1452
02:10:59.12 --> 02:11:03.60
Although if you ask me a question on Twitter, like I asked me the other day,

1453
02:11:03.60 --> 02:11:07.76
how can I wake up early, how can I work out every day and how can I eat the right foods? Yeah.

1454
02:11:07.76 --> 02:11:13.60
Yeah. I'm just going to tell you discipline. Right. Right. There's a little bit so

1455
02:11:13.60 --> 02:11:22.16
easy. Yeah. Well, the point there is that there's some shirts. They're cool. I think they're cool,

1456
02:11:22.16 --> 02:11:27.44
but if you think they're cool, you want to support podcasts. You get assured a hoodie, like some good stuff.

1457
02:11:27.44 --> 02:11:32.48
There. I think adding in some more stuff. Um, and look at them. If you, if you like some stuff,

1458
02:11:33.20 --> 02:11:37.68
get some of that support podcast. Support yourself too. Get a new shirt. It's kind of cool when

1459
02:11:37.68 --> 02:11:42.16
you order something. You know, the day it comes in, you know, even this regular Amazon stuff.

1460
02:11:42.16 --> 02:11:47.92
But it's a little microphone adapter for my other stuff. It comes in. What's your other stuff?

1461
02:11:48.72 --> 02:11:54.08
I do stuff. This is kind of messed up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's good. It's so good.

1462
02:11:55.04 --> 02:11:58.80
Anyway, so yeah, well, you know, shirts come in. You can wear. I'm going to be shirt.

1463
02:11:59.28 --> 02:12:02.88
Discipline equals freedom. Jockel's head says good backwards. When you look in the mirror,

1464
02:12:02.88 --> 02:12:08.88
it's telling you good, like, you know, that whole thing. Yeah. That's a good one. Whatever. The coffee mugs

1465
02:12:08.88 --> 02:12:15.68
are working with this guy, Chris. He's really helping you narrow down a better travel travel mug.

1466
02:12:15.68 --> 02:12:22.32
Yeah, the travel mug. It's going to be good. Real good. That's good. Yeah. Oh, the stuff on there.

1467
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:25.68
Look at it. I'm not saying buy it. I'm saying go there. If you like something, get something.

1468
02:12:26.24 --> 02:12:29.84
And if you want to respond, yeah, it's a good way to support the podcast. And actually,

1469
02:12:30.40 --> 02:12:36.16
so maybe someone will ask you about what that means. And you say, oh, it's, I listen to a podcast.

1470
02:12:36.16 --> 02:12:41.36
Yep, which happens a lot. According to my experience and the experience of others that email me,

1471
02:12:42.40 --> 02:12:45.84
they meet. They spread the word. People will be like, what does that mean? Who's that guy

1472
02:12:45.84 --> 02:12:50.40
under shirt? If you're like, and here's this, here's a funny one that you wouldn't really think of.

1473
02:12:50.40 --> 02:12:54.16
So let's say I'm wearing the Jockel good shirt. How's your face on it, right?

1474
02:12:55.76 --> 02:13:00.80
I'm at my friends house, barbecue, whatever. And we're like, hey, let's all take a picture

1475
02:13:00.80 --> 02:13:06.80
and you have the thing and it's, you know, the square that finds the faces. It's finding your face.

1476
02:13:06.80 --> 02:13:12.80
I'm sure. And they're like, oh wait, they're like, oh, it's finding your face on your shirt.

1477
02:13:12.80 --> 02:13:16.000
Yeah, go. And then later on they're like, who's that on your shirt?

1478
02:13:16.56 --> 02:13:19.20
Boom, spread the word. You know, it's like one of those kinds of things.

1479
02:13:20.16 --> 02:13:26.16
I like the idea spreading the word because what's cool is, you know, you know, I get a lot of messages

1480
02:13:26.16 --> 02:13:33.04
people saying, hey, thanks. Yeah. I lost 40 pounds. Hey, thanks. I'm back in school.

1481
02:13:33.04 --> 02:13:38.24
Hey, thanks. I got a promotion. I'm not doing any of that. You guys are doing it. But

1482
02:13:39.60 --> 02:13:43.12
you're somehow influenced on the fact that you're getting your, you're getting your

1483
02:13:43.12 --> 02:13:47.12
discipline together, you're working hard and you're getting your life is getting better. So when you

1484
02:13:47.12 --> 02:13:51.44
spread the word, you're helping somebody else too. Which is cool. Yep.

1485
02:13:51.44 --> 02:14:00.08
100%. Oh, but yeah, those are the ways, you know, other ways there's psychological warfare

1486
02:14:00.08 --> 02:14:07.36
in here. This is never the only one. So no more. Oh wait, no, every day. Those are two

1487
02:14:07.36 --> 02:14:11.44
different ones, right? No more and every day. Yes, I believe so. Okay, I listen to the every day one

1488
02:14:12.56 --> 02:14:16.40
because, you know, how like when you're like, hey, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm, I'm new. I turned

1489
02:14:16.40 --> 02:14:21.04
over and you leave whatever the expression is. I knew years resolution and you go hard

1490
02:14:21.04 --> 02:14:26.48
typically, typically you go hard. You're like, I'm, carbs have gone. You know, you don't cut a

1491
02:14:26.48 --> 02:14:31.28
little bit. They're gone, right? Yeah. After like a little while, you really like four, five days.

1492
02:14:31.28 --> 02:14:38.24
You're going to like, oh, maybe not gone, you know? So you listen to every day, right? Every day,

1493
02:14:38.24 --> 02:14:43.44
really, it not only does it like make you like fired up to keep going, but it puts it in perspective,

1494
02:14:43.44 --> 02:14:49.76
you know? Yeah. It's like you thought, this is a cliche, but Michael Jordan or something like this.

1495
02:14:49.76 --> 02:14:55.76
Someone who's doing because someone who's successful, you know, you didn't go back to old him five

1496
02:14:55.76 --> 02:14:59.84
days later, you know? No. And that sounds real obvious. And yeah, we heard that people, but that's

1497
02:14:59.84 --> 02:15:07.28
what, why that's effective. So psychological or free, you don't know, it is an album, spoken word album.

1498
02:15:07.28 --> 02:15:12.88
It's available on iTunes of like little for lack of a better term.

1499
02:15:12.88 --> 02:15:21.68
It's a verbal, psychological warfare. Yeah. Like verbal, you can listen to it. It tells you

1500
02:15:23.20 --> 02:15:29.12
to get after it. Yeah. Under certain circumstances. Yes, there's actually specifically made

1501
02:15:30.24 --> 02:15:36.24
to deal with common everyday weaknesses that we all miss. So many phases of those weaknesses.

1502
02:15:36.24 --> 02:15:45.28
You can just press play track seven track four. Oh, every that's asked for an alarm clock to wake up.

1503
02:15:45.84 --> 02:15:51.92
Just get this album, set it as your alarm tone. I'm waking you up in the morning. Yeah. Tell

1504
02:15:51.92 --> 02:15:55.60
you wife tell your significant others. Otherwise they're going to think there's a strange

1505
02:15:55.60 --> 02:16:00.48
man. The room talking them and they're going to freak out. They'll out their firearm. Bad things

1506
02:16:00.48 --> 02:16:09.84
could happen. Psychological warfare. Yeah. Psychological. I should think I should put on like Amazon

1507
02:16:09.84 --> 02:16:16.56
music too. Yeah. Good. Yeah. But yeah, currently iTunes sort psychological warfare is on Google

1508
02:16:16.56 --> 02:16:22.56
play to your hyperlink. I don't know. I don't know. The podcast is no, I know the podcast is. Yeah,

1509
02:16:23.44 --> 02:16:28.72
the distribution channels. You make my hand. Yeah, I got to expand for sure. Expand, getting the game.

1510
02:16:28.72 --> 02:16:35.76
Yeah. But that's a good one. And incidentally supports the podcast. That's true. Very true.

1511
02:16:35.76 --> 02:16:43.28
Which is appreciated. All right. So also you can get chocolate, that supports the podcast and it

1512
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:52.16
supports you and it's in stock. We got a bunch of it and it will do things to you.

1513
02:16:52.16 --> 02:17:03.92
If you want to crush the souls of your enemies, drink some chocolate, it'll be

1514
02:17:03.92 --> 02:17:11.52
little bit easier to do that. It'll taste better. So that's that we had to get after it mugs.

1515

02:19:04.64 --> 02:19:08.08
little bit about these Amazon clicks and the store purchases and the getting the tea and the

1529
02:19:08.08 --> 02:19:14.96
mugs and the teachers and all that stuff. Just so you know, that support is actually literally what

1530
02:19:14.96 --> 02:19:21.12
fuels the podcast. That's what the podcast runs off of. So thanks for all that. Truly, we appreciate it.

1535
02:19:57.04 --> 02:20:11.60
And thank you for crushing those faults by getting out there with discipline and getting after it.
