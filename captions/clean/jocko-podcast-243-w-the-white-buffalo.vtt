00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 243 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a different world when you get home.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I mean, at some point while you're over there, you accept death.

4
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You give away normal life, you give away the normal world.

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's probably just a coping mechanism of some kind.

6
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
To just accept your fate.

7
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To accept your fate.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That the world is war.

9
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That the world is dirt and blood and pain and death.

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And you have to accept that.

11
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
At least I did.

12
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then I'd be lying to you.

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If I said that I didn't want that acceptance that I didn't want that attitude.

14
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Because the world, the normal world, the everyday world is a complicated place.

15
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There's all kinds of things going on.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Family and friends and mortgage payments and bills to pay in a future to worry about and retirement and savings and the kids.

17
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And the list goes on.

18
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But in war, that's all gone.

19
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There really isn't even a future.

20
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Nothing else matters.

21
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Nothing but the mission and the men.

22
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That was my concern.

23
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Do I think about my family?

24
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Sometimes.

25
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I had other things to think about.

26
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I had other things to worry about.

27
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Bullets and bombs and blood and shit and life and death.

28
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And you go through it.

29
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You get through it.

30
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Some of you do.

31
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Some of you don't.

32
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And for those that do make it through.

33
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
One day, just as quickly as it started, it's over.

34
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You get on a plane and you fly home.

35
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Back to the world.

36
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And on that flight home.

37
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I only think about one thing.

38
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That I didn't bring home all my men.

39
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And then the door of the plane opens.

40
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And we're home.

41
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And then 24 hours of flight time.

42
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You go from Ramadi, I rack to San Diego, California.

43
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:12.000
At least physically you do.

44
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Mentally, it's going to take a little bit more time to come around.

45
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But you soon realize that you are alive.

46
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And you have a house and a wife and kids and mortgage and a future.

47
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And you are alive and you are thankful.

48
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And you want to live a life that honors your friends that didn't come home.

49
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And then it's let's go.

50
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Let's get it on.

51
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Let's serve and fight and drink and eat and play guitar and run and roll and serve some more.

52
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Let's go.

53
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Let's do this. We're lucky to even be here.

54
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Fall on.

55
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And we're lucky to have a life that honors your friends.

56
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
For me, much of that time.

57
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The surfing and the rolling and the eating and the drinking and the jam and on the get box.

58
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We're spent with Seth Stone.

59
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The Delta Patoon Commander.

60
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He bought a house a mile away from mine.

61
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
He was like an uncle to my kids part of the family.

62
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And you know he's a much nicer guy than me, much friendlier than me.

63
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Always made friends.

64
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And before we left on deployment, he had somehow linked up with a guy by the name of Jean Cooper,

65
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
legendary surfboard, japer.

66
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And Seth got Jean to make us some boards.

67
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Some epic boards.

68
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And when we got home, we got those boards.

69
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And we wrote them.

70
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And through Jean Seth also linked up with a guy named Mike Black that made a surf movie.

71
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
If it can even be called that's kind of a crazy surf movie called Invasion from Planet C.

72
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The sci-fi surf movie.

73
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It was unique.

74
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It was kind of wild and funny and insane and just kind of completely crazy.

75
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And maybe that's why we liked it.

76
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Because it had some good surfing and it made us laugh.

77
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And also had some good music in it.

78
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Some real good music.

79
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
One song in that movie was called Mad Man.

80
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It was by a band called The White Buffalo.

81
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And we heard the lyrics to the song.

82
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And they made sense to us.

83
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
There's one section of lyrics that says like an animal out of his den.

84
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You better hide your money.

85
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You better hide your children.

86
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You can't keep your fear at bay because the mad man's Roman needs streets today.

87
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
The mad man's common.

88
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We got that.

89
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We understood what that was all about.

90
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
In the White Buffalo songs where some other surf movies along the way,

91
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
one called Shelter.

92
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
The song called Wrong.

93
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
New some other guys in there.

94
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Joel Tudor was in that movie.

95
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So Seth figured out where the rest of this music came from.

96
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And we started listening to this white Buffalo.

97
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Came like a little soundtrack.

98
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Because the music and the lyrics and the sound and the attitude.

99
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Well, somehow it was about us.

100
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
About what we had seen about what we had been through.

101
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
About what we were going through.

102
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I don't really remember exactly when we went and saw the white Buffalo for the first time.

103
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I know that.

104
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We saw him one time at UCSD in some kind of cafe and there was probably about 12 people there.

105
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Some of the casbons and Diego, the belly up a few times.

106
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Eventually we saw him at bigger places like the house of blues and the observatory.

107
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And when you got somehow this guy.

108
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
They got us.

109
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And I remember the first time we saw him at the Casba.

110
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And it's the last time we saw him when there was a pretty small crowd.

111
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But it was a small enough crowd that everyone that was there knew who he was.

112
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
There was no people wandering in.

113
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They knew who the white Buffalo was.

114
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
They were there to see him.

115
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And people were drinking and people were carrying on.

116
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And they were talking and laughing.

117
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And then the PA music faded.

118
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Then the lights went dark.

119
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And then he walked out on stage.

120
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Alone.

121
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And he played.

122
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
He started strumming.

123
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And that guitar.

124
00:12:33.52 --> 00:12:37.14
But before the night that I pardon my ophthal Íve

125
00:12:37.06 --> 00:12:41.56
æitwhy thinks that I'm a fool

126
00:12:42.26 --> 00:12:44.40
for the nighteeeee

127
00:12:45.36 --> 00:12:46.48
Say that I around

128
00:12:47.40 --> 00:12:48.66
the night

129
00:12:49.26 --> 00:12:50.06
Bad rhythm

130
00:12:50.60 --> 00:12:52.06
Then I'm at the end

131
00:12:52.84 --> 00:12:53.80
And birds sail

132
00:12:54.24 --> 00:12:55.16
A true rhythm

133
00:12:55.60 --> 00:12:56.14
I'm a true hero

134
00:12:56.20 --> 00:12:57.92
But I don't know

135
00:12:57.92 --> 00:13:04.92
Now my digging a grave, whose old half could do

136
00:13:08.92 --> 00:13:15.92
Far him to wait back home, me gave everything

137
00:13:15.92 --> 00:13:28.92
Now we see what was true

138
00:13:29.92 --> 00:13:37.92
Father, I gave my sody

139
00:13:37.92 --> 00:13:44.92
I came in blind-folded view, it was all that I knew

140
00:13:48.92 --> 00:13:54.92
Looping your arms, then I flout a hill of tears

141
00:13:54.92 --> 00:14:09.92
Now we see what was true

142
00:14:10.92 --> 00:14:14.92
Who would come on out from the cold?

143
00:14:15.92 --> 00:14:19.92
You lost outside that arms and no

144
00:14:19.92 --> 00:14:23.92
It's not who I'd just say it's what you do

145
00:14:24.92 --> 00:14:28.92
Just keep away seeing you, as you're true

146
00:14:29.92 --> 00:14:33.92
You'll change their reality

147
00:14:34.92 --> 00:14:38.92
There's no pain, there's no misery

148
00:14:39.92 --> 00:14:43.92
It just polyester blood in the bruise

149
00:14:43.92 --> 00:14:49.92
Because there's just no way you can live

150
00:14:49.92 --> 00:14:53.92
Now we see what was true

151
00:15:19.92 --> 00:15:26.92
Come true, that was a soldier's view

152
00:15:29.92 --> 00:15:35.92
I did what's as material was strong in your new

153
00:15:35.92 --> 00:15:46.92
Come true, now I'm just a stranger to you

154
00:15:48.92 --> 00:15:55.92
And the name is true through me away when you're through

155
00:15:55.92 --> 00:16:06.92
Come to the brave and the free, the red white in blue

156
00:16:07.92 --> 00:16:10.92
I wish it was true

157
00:16:10.92 --> 00:16:17.92
And the place was silent for a second

158
00:16:18.92 --> 00:16:23.92
Set the night where we stand there like everybody else

159
00:16:23.92 --> 00:16:42.92
Then we looked at each other, we smiled, the place went crazy

160
00:16:43.92 --> 00:16:46.92
We did too

161
00:16:46.92 --> 00:16:53.92
It was a good night, it's a good memory

162
00:16:59.92 --> 00:17:07.92
And memories are all I have left of Seth now

163
00:17:10.92 --> 00:17:12.92
But no songs

164
00:17:12.92 --> 00:17:17.92
Those are some powerful songs

165
00:17:21.92 --> 00:17:25.92
And it's an honor today to have the man behind those memories

166
00:17:26.92 --> 00:17:27.92
And behind those songs

167
00:17:28.92 --> 00:17:31.92
The man himself, a man named Jake Smith

168
00:17:32.92 --> 00:17:35.92
Otherwise known as the white buffalo

169
00:17:36.92 --> 00:17:38.92
Jake

170
00:17:38.92 --> 00:17:43.92
Thanks for coming down man, thank you for having me

171
00:17:44.92 --> 00:17:47.92
No pressure on that set right there

172
00:17:48.92 --> 00:17:49.92
That was intense

173
00:17:50.92 --> 00:17:53.92
Yeah man, tell me about it

174
00:17:54.92 --> 00:17:58.92
Lots of stuff wrapped up in the songs that you write

175
00:17:59.92 --> 00:18:03.92
It's kind of crazy when I think about all the time that I spent sitting there listening

176
00:18:03.92 --> 00:18:07.92
And I'm listening to him going to your shows

177
00:18:08.92 --> 00:18:11.92
Just being some random dude, we almost got to fight at the belly up on time

178
00:18:12.92 --> 00:18:16.92
Some guys were talking just mad dog and Seth and Seth

179
00:18:17.92 --> 00:18:19.92
What was like six to you know

180
00:18:20.92 --> 00:18:23.92
And I know I look like a serial killer for sure

181
00:18:24.92 --> 00:18:26.92
Seth is not quite as much because he's too nice

182
00:18:27.92 --> 00:18:30.92
But still he's a strapping dude with a shaved head

183
00:18:30.92 --> 00:18:35.92
And cauliflower ears right that's generally not a go situation for scraps

184
00:18:36.92 --> 00:18:37.92
That's a sign

185
00:18:38.92 --> 00:18:43.92
So at belly up we're standing there and this dude's kind of nudging in the Seth and Seth's kind of looking at him

186
00:18:43.92 --> 00:18:48.92
And I'm standing behind the guy which in the Jiu-Jitsu world means I can kill you

187
00:18:49.92 --> 00:18:51.92
You don't know you have zero chance

188
00:18:52.92 --> 00:18:53.92
But it didn't happen

189
00:18:54.92 --> 00:18:57.92
Lots of memories man, it's awesome to have you come down here

190
00:18:57.92 --> 00:18:59.92
I'm excited, yeah my pleasure

191
00:19:00.92 --> 00:19:02.92
Let's talk a little bit about you man, enough about me

192
00:19:03.92 --> 00:19:05.92
I've been talking about myself here for a long time

193
00:19:06.92 --> 00:19:07.92
What's here about you

194
00:19:08.92 --> 00:19:10.92
So you were born where up in Oregon?

195
00:19:11.92 --> 00:19:12.92
I was born in Eugene, Oregon

196
00:19:13.92 --> 00:19:15.92
And what was that all about where your parents were working up there?

197
00:19:16.92 --> 00:19:18.92
My dad was still going to school, he's a college professor

198
00:19:19.92 --> 00:19:20.92
And he was

199
00:19:21.92 --> 00:19:24.92
I think he was still working on his master at that point

200
00:19:24.92 --> 00:19:28.92
And we moved down to, he might have been born from his peachy

201
00:19:29.92 --> 00:19:31.92
And then we moved down to Southern California, Huntington Beach

202
00:19:32.92 --> 00:19:36.92
When I was maybe one, he continued that at Pepper Dine

203
00:19:37.92 --> 00:19:42.92
And it's in student teaching and then we were there for maybe since I was one until twenty-dying

204
00:19:43.92 --> 00:19:44.92
Malibu

205
00:19:45.92 --> 00:19:46.92
Yeah, we didn't live there though

206
00:19:47.92 --> 00:19:49.92
But we lived in Huntington Beach, which is all of us

207
00:19:49.92 --> 00:19:53.92
Yeah, well, it needs gold too, but I mean, let's face it if you lived in Malibu and you surf Malibu all the time

208
00:19:54.92 --> 00:19:55.92
We're going to be here right now

209
00:19:56.92 --> 00:19:58.92
You need a whole perspective

210
00:19:59.92 --> 00:20:02.92
So you grew up in Huntington Beach then

211
00:20:03.92 --> 00:20:07.92
And what was the situation your dad's a college professor at Pepper Dine?

212
00:20:08.92 --> 00:20:11.92
No, my dad was a college professor at Cal State of Mingus Hills

213
00:20:11.92 --> 00:20:19.92
Oh, I see so he did a student teaching or if it is his PhD there and then moved on to Cal State of Mingus Hills

214
00:20:20.92 --> 00:20:21.92
What was he teach?

215
00:20:22.92 --> 00:20:23.92
Public administration?

216
00:20:24.92 --> 00:20:25.92
What even is that?

217
00:20:26.92 --> 00:20:27.92
It's tough to explain, right?

218
00:20:28.92 --> 00:20:29.92
I think it's like the study of city budgets

219
00:20:30.92 --> 00:20:31.92
I think a lot of policemen take it

220
00:20:32.92 --> 00:20:35.92
City planners, it's like in the political science world

221
00:20:36.92 --> 00:20:38.92
What do you think makes a man

222
00:20:38.92 --> 00:20:41.92
say to themselves, they're looking at the courses

223
00:20:42.92 --> 00:20:45.92
And they're like, there you go, public administration, that's called my name

224
00:20:46.92 --> 00:20:46.92
Yeah, I don't know

225
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:51.92
And he's interested by some odd things like that

226
00:20:52.92 --> 00:20:57.92
It was surprising, not surprising, but yeah, it's one of the lesser known

227
00:20:58.92 --> 00:21:02.92
You know pedagogies, it's not a normal

228
00:21:03.92 --> 00:21:04.92
When you say what that is, most people say

229
00:21:05.92 --> 00:21:06.92
What I said, exactly

230
00:21:06.92 --> 00:21:08.92
What I said, you know, what about your mom, what was she up to?

231
00:21:09.92 --> 00:21:11.92
She was a labor and delivery nurse

232
00:21:12.92 --> 00:21:13.92
Brother and sister

233
00:21:14.92 --> 00:21:16.92
You have a brother and sister, correct?

234
00:21:17.92 --> 00:21:18.92
You're the baby

235
00:21:19.92 --> 00:21:21.92
Was that whole thing work out, you know that whole thing?

236
00:21:22.92 --> 00:21:23.92
You know what I'm talking about?

237
00:21:24.92 --> 00:21:26.92
Yeah, where you're the, so now you get caught all the everything

238
00:21:27.92 --> 00:21:29.92
You're the spoiled kid, it's part of it

239
00:21:29.92 --> 00:21:32.92
You're the only kid, you're the only kid

240
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:35.92
How far from the beach did you live in Huntington Beach?

241
00:21:36.92 --> 00:21:38.92
I live, we used to take the bus to go surf

242
00:21:39.92 --> 00:21:41.92
Okay, and I was young, two miles

243
00:21:42.92 --> 00:21:44.92
Oh, that's not bad, you could teach cruiser that all day long

244
00:21:45.92 --> 00:21:47.92
We could, but we busted, or got dropped off for the most part

245
00:21:48.92 --> 00:21:49.92
The bus was easier than a beach cruiser?

246
00:21:50.92 --> 00:21:51.92
I don't know why we busted, you know?

247
00:21:52.92 --> 00:21:55.92
It's a weird, yeah, I think it was all BMX

248
00:21:55.92 --> 00:21:58.92
So we were just wasn't an option to have the rack and whatnot

249
00:21:59.92 --> 00:22:02.92
They haven't, did they have them, you had to carry it on your arm back then

250
00:22:03.92 --> 00:22:05.92
I don't even know if they had the rack's back then

251
00:22:06.92 --> 00:22:09.92
Now you get all kinds of racks, you're good to go

252
00:22:10.92 --> 00:22:13.92
BMX or not, that's true, I think they, they can, how much we started on it

253
00:22:14.92 --> 00:22:18.92
I surf quite a bit, but it wasn't something that I picked up

254
00:22:19.92 --> 00:22:22.92
Super easily, it was the age of the small thin board

255
00:22:22.92 --> 00:22:27.92
I've always been a big dude and to ride, you know, I can't afford a slater's board

256
00:22:28.92 --> 00:22:30.92
I'm on a 6-3 and I'm 6-2, you know?

257
00:22:31.92 --> 00:22:34.92
It's a way for thin thing that I can't, you know, I'm sitting out in the line

258
00:22:35.92 --> 00:22:36.92
I'm up to my tits, you know, the water

259
00:22:37.92 --> 00:22:40.92
And it's not going to float me, it took me a while to just go like

260
00:22:41.92 --> 00:22:43.92
I mean, I'd probably get a bigger board, something that actually can

261
00:22:44.92 --> 00:22:48.92
I can paddle in the waves, that's a big mental transition to big man

262
00:22:48.92 --> 00:22:52.92
My buddy Josh Hall just made me a board, that's 11-6

263
00:22:53.92 --> 00:22:57.92
It's the thickest board I think a human could make

264
00:22:58.92 --> 00:23:00.92
Because my son was telling him what I wanted

265
00:23:01.92 --> 00:23:04.92
And they were doing this like as a secret surprise for me, right?

266
00:23:05.92 --> 00:23:06.92
What's that cool?

267
00:23:06.92 --> 00:23:07.92
I see a secret surprise behind my back

268
00:23:08.92 --> 00:23:11.92
So my son was telling him, hey, you know, and Josh had some ideas

269
00:23:12.92 --> 00:23:15.92
And my son's like, no, the biggest thickest board you could possibly make

270
00:23:15.92 --> 00:23:18.92
And Josh Hall delivered big time, you got to try that board

271
00:23:19.92 --> 00:23:22.92
I got some thick boards too, but I got a couple of one of mine looks like a paddle board

272
00:23:23.92 --> 00:23:27.92
But it's not a paper, yeah, it's a surfboard for a large man, right?

273
00:23:28.92 --> 00:23:33.92
So you, and I know you played, you were a freaking hardcore baseball player, right?

274
00:23:34.92 --> 00:23:37.92
I was, that was kind of my dream as a child, ended up playing college baseball,

275
00:23:38.92 --> 00:23:40.92
Division 1 baseball, and it's college ship, typically baseball

276
00:23:40.92 --> 00:23:45.92
And so I was a little bit more position than you play

277
00:23:46.92 --> 00:23:50.92
Until I was a senior in high school, like a great shortstop

278
00:23:51.92 --> 00:23:55.92
So I was on the athletic side, especially for a big man

279
00:23:56.92 --> 00:23:59.92
That I was going to be like, the next like cow ripkin, like, you know, and he was, you know, big

280
00:24:00.92 --> 00:24:04.92
That's a big statement you just made, they fought, I was going to be the next cow rip

281
00:24:04.92 --> 00:24:08.92
I was a little bit older than you, but that was the room Amy for that idea

282
00:24:09.92 --> 00:24:11.92
But then we actually had this young kid who came in as a shortstop

283
00:24:12.92 --> 00:24:15.92
Who was a sophomore or something, it was just a little phenom, and then I moved over to third base

284
00:24:16.92 --> 00:24:20.92
I didn't play, well I played baseball, my dad wanted, my dad liked really like sports a lot

285
00:24:21.92 --> 00:24:23.92
That's why my name is Jocco, by the way

286
00:24:24.92 --> 00:24:29.92
And I didn't like sports as much as him at all, I like machine guns, right?

287
00:24:29.92 --> 00:24:35.92
So, but I would get put in the sports randomly, oh, you know, go play little league

288
00:24:36.92 --> 00:24:39.92
And I was on the braves, echo gets into this kind of thing

289
00:24:40.92 --> 00:24:43.92
But I just wasn't really, wasn't really my thing

290
00:24:44.92 --> 00:24:47.92
So years later I went and talked to a professional baseball team

291
00:24:48.92 --> 00:24:50.92
And when I was going up, I remembered the baseball players

292
00:24:51.92 --> 00:24:53.92
It seemed like most of the baseball players that were pros

293
00:24:54.92 --> 00:24:56.92
They were like these little guys, right?

294
00:24:56.92 --> 00:25:01.92
Like little Dominican guys, little porn reek and guys that were fast and everything

295
00:25:02.92 --> 00:25:06.92
And when I went met with this team, which was a few years ago, they were freaking monsters

296
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:09.92
They were all huge, yeah, oh they're massive now, I mean it's a whole different

297
00:25:10.92 --> 00:25:11.92
Is that a new thing?

298
00:25:11.92 --> 00:25:18.92
Yeah, I mean if you look even if you look at footage from the 80s, even early 90s, they were way smaller

299
00:25:19.92 --> 00:25:21.92
How much practice did you play?

300
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:27.92
I mean, are you one of the sports was different? Like nowadays, if you're a kid and you're going to play sports, your parents

301
00:25:28.92 --> 00:25:34.92
Like cool, you're going to do that sport, you're going to play it 365 days a year, you're going to get coaching, you're going to get some private

302
00:25:35.92 --> 00:25:42.92
Whatever, hitting batting coach, that's coming to work with you and your kids like, oh, we need a batting coach

303
00:25:43.92 --> 00:25:45.92
Yeah, sure, no problem. Okay, here's my son, he's four

304
00:25:46.92 --> 00:25:47.92
Was it like that for you?

305
00:25:47.92 --> 00:25:55.92
I mean, I did do extra stuff and I did, you know, did extra work with hitting coaches and fielding coaches

306
00:25:56.92 --> 00:26:00.92
And it was definitely a big part of me, it was a, I wanted to be a major league baseball player when I was a kid

307
00:26:01.92 --> 00:26:07.92
And my dad, I come from kind of a wrestling family, my dad was a wrestler, my brother was a sport

308
00:26:08.92 --> 00:26:11.92
And, but they're, he's not a ball sport guy at all

309
00:26:11.92 --> 00:26:16.92
And so he was kind of always blown away by the idea like how did this sort of this child come from

310
00:26:17.92 --> 00:26:21.92
You know, he used to say that he could throw ball at me

311
00:26:22.92 --> 00:26:26.92
Like when we were young, my brother was like a year and a half, all of a, he could just throw a ball at me when I was like two

312
00:26:27.92 --> 00:26:31.92
And I would just like reach up and snatch it, come now, grab reflexes, probably

313
00:26:32.92 --> 00:26:35.92
Hit off my, you know, hit off my brother's chest and land on the floor

314
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:41.92
But, but they added the, you know, they were, they were hard nose guys, you know, my dad's a, was a badass, you know

315
00:26:42.92 --> 00:26:44.92
What, what, how old were you started playing baseball?

316
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:52.92
Actually my dad, wouldn't let his play, he thought it was too political when I was young, just with all the bullshit

317
00:26:53.92 --> 00:26:56.92
Where did you say I don't know, I do where you're at, how was baseball political in 19?

318
00:26:57.92 --> 00:26:58.92
What is his 19?

319
00:26:59.92 --> 00:27:02.92
I mean, I was born in 74, so, you know,

320
00:27:02.92 --> 00:27:07.92
It was just a lot of tension kids.

321
00:27:08.92 --> 00:27:13.92
You mean political like the, the dad with the kid, the dad, my kid, the emotions of that he thought

322
00:27:14.92 --> 00:27:19.92
Like soccer was a better game, a better family sport, that kind of thing, so we played soccer

323
00:27:20.92 --> 00:27:23.92
And then he finally, he budged, or look as my brother was older, me, I was one of the play baseball

324
00:27:24.92 --> 00:27:27.92
And then he, I mean, I was like minor B's, I was like, I was still quite young when I started playing

325
00:27:28.92 --> 00:27:29.92
How good was your brother?

326
00:27:29.92 --> 00:27:31.92
At baseball, he was fast

327
00:27:33.92 --> 00:27:37.92
So he had a throw, it's not about the freaking camera of the structure

328
00:27:38.92 --> 00:27:42.92
Ouch, I guess the ball is hitting him in the face when you hold man through his hand

329
00:27:43.92 --> 00:27:46.92
He was a wrestler, I mean, he was a different, oh, you're brother wrestled

330
00:27:47.92 --> 00:27:52.92
My brother wrestled too, yeah, okay, he did, he wrestled, my dad wrestled in college, he wrestled with organ state under Dale Thomas

331
00:27:52.92 --> 00:28:01.92
Dale and coach some at Oregon as well as Oregon state and my brother, he, he just wrestled in high school

332
00:28:02.92 --> 00:28:05.92
He was good, my high school, yeah, he's wrestling in California high school is no joke

333
00:28:06.92 --> 00:28:09.92
Yeah, it was the largest wrestling tournament in the world, I think he was C. I think

334
00:28:10.92 --> 00:28:13.92
I would say my brother, so it's a good, it's a good, props to your brother

335
00:28:14.92 --> 00:28:19.92
So at what point, what was your, what was your, what was your, what was your, you're dealing with music

336
00:28:19.92 --> 00:28:26.92
It was late, I mean, it hit me super late, I was probably, I tell the story and I don't even know the actual, how

337
00:28:27.92 --> 00:28:31.92
What we just did into a new or a little kid, we were country music fans, my parents were crazy about country

338
00:28:32.92 --> 00:28:38.92
And it was all country all the time in the, in the station wagon and we would go see country music concerts

339
00:28:39.92 --> 00:28:42.92
It was kind of the transition time of country when it was getting

340
00:28:42.92 --> 00:28:50.92
Not over the top cheesy, but you know, it was like moving to the hall and Jackson was coming in and it was getting a little more sticky

341
00:28:51.92 --> 00:28:55.92
Then it was kind of these heartfelt songs of my youth

342
00:28:56.92 --> 00:29:01.92
But yeah, it was all, it was all country music was odd for, you know, a kid to be, until I really got the high school

343
00:29:02.92 --> 00:29:08.92
Was exclusively country music listener and kind of proud of that fact

344
00:29:08.92 --> 00:29:13.92
But then I got really into punk when I was in high school, where did that come from?

345
00:29:14.92 --> 00:29:19.92
I'm not entirely sure there wasn't really a kid named, there was a, whatever, no, it was my, I have a check this out

346
00:29:20.92 --> 00:29:24.92
One of my buddies who used to take me to school in the morning, he was more of a metal head

347
00:29:25.92 --> 00:29:33.92
And I don't know exactly how I got and so he would listen to, you know, with this mentality, I can dance it, you know, and tracks

348
00:29:33.92 --> 00:29:38.92
And then I started listening to punk, but it was more of the Southern California stuff

349
00:29:39.92 --> 00:29:43.92
You know, I started kind of getting into higher core stuff and then that's when I got like a tar kind of

350
00:29:44.92 --> 00:29:48.92
But I was more like bad religion, circle jerks, descendants, stuff that was a little more melodic

351
00:29:49.92 --> 00:29:56.92
Me and me, you know, and then I got a guitar, we go drink beers in my buddy's house

352
00:29:56.92 --> 00:30:03.92
And his dad would play John Pryne songs and some of the core gear kind of Dylan songs

353
00:30:04.92 --> 00:30:07.92
And I was 18, 19 maybe and

354
00:30:08.92 --> 00:30:10.92
I was like, oh, let's go get a guitar

355
00:30:11.92 --> 00:30:16.92
When you talk about music, I don't know if you think this, I think this, when I was younger

356
00:30:17.92 --> 00:30:22.92
Like within, when I met someone, shook their hands, hey nice to meet you, within the first

357
00:30:22.92 --> 00:30:29.92
Let's say seven to nine minutes of talking to someone, I would say what kind of music do you like?

358
00:30:30.92 --> 00:30:34.92
Because it would be like a straight up indicator, it would tell you a lot about them

359
00:30:35.92 --> 00:30:43.92
And nowadays, like sometimes I meet, I got four kids and they're all whatever, 20, 19, 17 and 10

360
00:30:44.92 --> 00:30:48.92
And for a while, I would say, you know, what kind of music do you like to these kids?

361
00:30:48.92 --> 00:30:53.92
And they're just, it's so, there's so much music, there's so much music out there

362
00:30:54.92 --> 00:30:59.92
You know, you know, you used to get the weird avoidance answer to that question, it's like, oh, let's never think

363
00:31:00.92 --> 00:31:01.92
Yeah, you know what you're saying?

364
00:31:02.92 --> 00:31:05.92
I used to say, okay, so you, to me that used to mean to me, you have no personality

365
00:31:06.92 --> 00:31:12.92
You don't say, bro, I like, I like Nordic, death metal, whoever, then I know who you are

366
00:31:13.92 --> 00:31:16.92
Or you know, I like the dead, okay, I know who you are or whatever

367
00:31:16.92 --> 00:31:21.92
You know, I like, whatever, hair metal, life-bavin

368
00:31:22.92 --> 00:31:25.92
So, so you used to identify kind of like who you are, right?

369
00:31:26.92 --> 00:31:29.92
I mean, it was even part of the fashion, like you, you couldn't really like everything

370
00:31:30.92 --> 00:31:34.92
If you were into one thing, that's what you looked like, you had the big hair or if you were in a punk

371
00:31:35.92 --> 00:31:39.92
You, you know, maybe it looked like a skin head, if you were in, you know, you wore the pants,

372
00:31:40.92 --> 00:31:44.92
If you were in a country, you had the pants with the stitching, you know, or it's like

373
00:31:44.92 --> 00:31:48.92
Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's almost like identifier

374
00:31:49.92 --> 00:31:55.92
And then people nowadays, there's just so much music and it's so accessible

375
00:31:56.92 --> 00:32:02.92
So when I was a kid, in order to get music that we wanted to hear, we had to go to New York

376
00:32:03.92 --> 00:32:07.92
Maybe we had to go to a good record store, which they just weren't all of the places

377
00:32:07.92 --> 00:32:14.92
And the waterberry, good brassity gets on, but, you know, we'd go there and, and the, but that was part of the inhibitor

378
00:32:15.92 --> 00:32:21.92
The other part was money, like it costs 21 dollars for an album

379
00:32:22.92 --> 00:32:26.92
And, you know, we just didn't, so I, you know, I, I love music

380
00:32:27.92 --> 00:32:32.92
And I had probably, I don't know, 30 albums

381
00:32:32.92 --> 00:32:36.92
That I just listened to over and over and over and over again, the bar one from someone

382
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:40.92
And of course, we got the little, we got tape cassettes too, you get the dub tape cassette

383
00:32:41.92 --> 00:32:44.92
But even that was kind of hard to get because they would all sound like crap

384
00:32:45.92 --> 00:32:47.92
Not that we really cared that much, I mean, let's face it

385
00:32:48.92 --> 00:32:50.92
Nowadays, everybody kind of listens to everything

386
00:32:51.92 --> 00:32:52.92
There's a lot out there

387
00:32:53.92 --> 00:32:54.92
Not to mention the crop, all the crossover

388
00:32:55.92 --> 00:32:58.92
Seems same, you got country and you got what the naz kid

389
00:32:58.92 --> 00:33:02.92
You know, old town road, you know, they got, we got a lot across the, just want to say

390
00:33:03.92 --> 00:33:05.92
So you could, you're just opening it up even wider

391
00:33:06.92 --> 00:33:08.92
Because, oh yeah, now you really are listening to everything

392
00:33:09.92 --> 00:33:11.92
Things are getting crazy

393
00:33:12.92 --> 00:33:14.92
It's a kind of upsetting now

394
00:33:15.92 --> 00:33:17.92
Really, like when they start rapping in country

395
00:33:18.92 --> 00:33:19.92
They do throw you for a loop sometimes, yeah

396
00:33:20.92 --> 00:33:22.92
This is not, I don't know, you're saying that's a setting, I code doesn't seem upset

397
00:33:23.92 --> 00:33:26.92
I just observing the landscape of music at the time

398
00:33:26.92 --> 00:33:28.92
I have to remember that

399
00:33:29.92 --> 00:33:31.92
I'll tell you, look, echoes are a decent guy

400
00:33:32.92 --> 00:33:35.92
When we go places he drives, I ride

401
00:33:36.92 --> 00:33:39.92
Which means he gets control of the music situation

402
00:33:40.92 --> 00:33:41.92
Which is a problem

403
00:33:42.92 --> 00:33:43.92
For you, I can see how that could be

404
00:33:46.92 --> 00:33:49.92
So, sort of, did you get, so you said you played D1 College

405
00:33:50.92 --> 00:33:52.92
So you get in a college, you get in a college

406
00:33:52.92 --> 00:33:56.92
Where'd you go to college?

407
00:33:57.92 --> 00:34:00.92
Went two years at a junior college in Huntington Beach

408
00:34:01.92 --> 00:34:03.92
Golden West College, and then I did two years at St. Mary's College

409
00:34:04.92 --> 00:34:06.92
Which was in the East Bay in Maraga

410
00:34:07.92 --> 00:34:12.92
Same league at the time at least, was like Pepper Dine, Santa Clara, Royal Merrimont, San Diego, you see San Diego

411
00:34:13.92 --> 00:34:14.92
You're okay

412
00:34:15.92 --> 00:34:18.92
Did you, so is that when you were talking that you got a guitar

413
00:34:19.92 --> 00:34:20.92
Was that something high school you got a guitar?

414
00:34:20.92 --> 00:34:24.92
Prior to that, so probably when I was 19, probably about when

415
00:34:25.92 --> 00:34:27.92
I don't know if it was a summer between my senior year in high school

416
00:34:28.92 --> 00:34:31.92
And college, your dad held you back, you were old

417
00:34:32.92 --> 00:34:33.92
Right?

418
00:34:34.92 --> 00:34:37.92
Dude, they're hardcore wrestling, like families

419
00:34:38.92 --> 00:34:40.92
Their kids are going to school, they're like starting

420
00:34:41.92 --> 00:34:42.92
They're graduating when they're 23 years old

421
00:34:44.92 --> 00:34:45.92
That's the way he was going to be

422
00:34:46.92 --> 00:34:48.92
He was a college professor, so I think education was, it was equally

423
00:34:48.92 --> 00:34:52.92
If not more important to him than a hard

424
00:34:53.92 --> 00:34:55.92
You know, dominant sports, wrestling, so

425
00:34:56.92 --> 00:34:58.92
Dude, wrestling is crazy man, right?

426
00:34:59.92 --> 00:35:02.92
I know, I mean, my kids wrestle and it's like, it's mayhem, it's mayhem

427
00:35:03.92 --> 00:35:05.92
You want to talk about political, your dad's talk about soccer

428
00:35:06.92 --> 00:35:08.92
Come through a freaking wrestling, turn around

429
00:35:09.92 --> 00:35:12.92
You could say go to the state championship, Baker's field california

430
00:35:13.92 --> 00:35:14.92
It's insane, it's awesome

431
00:35:14.92 --> 00:35:18.92
Okay, so you're still in high school and you're 27 years old

432
00:35:19.92 --> 00:35:22.92
So you're still in high school, and that's when you go

433
00:35:23.92 --> 00:35:27.92
You hear, you hear a little bit of acoustic music that you go

434
00:35:28.92 --> 00:35:31.92
Yeah, my friend's dad would play, we just drank beers and he would hang out

435
00:35:32.92 --> 00:35:34.92
And he would play, it's just songs and I was like, oh, it looks easy

436
00:35:35.92 --> 00:35:37.92
Oh, he was playing guitar, he was playing guitar and singing himself

437
00:35:38.92 --> 00:35:40.92
He was playing record, he was in Spending record, he was actually singing

438
00:35:41.92 --> 00:35:42.92
And playing them, Sam Bulo

439
00:35:42.92 --> 00:35:46.92
Damn, and he wrote down a few chords for me

440
00:35:47.92 --> 00:35:51.92
And then I was on my way, and kind of I didn't even really learn songs

441
00:35:52.92 --> 00:35:53.92
I started writing songs almost immediately

442
00:35:54.92 --> 00:35:59.92
And not with the agenda to be like, I'm gonna be a musician

443
00:36:00.92 --> 00:36:03.92
I was still a baseball player, that was still a dream, you know

444
00:36:04.92 --> 00:36:07.92
And I don't know, I just kept writing

445
00:36:07.92 --> 00:36:11.92
We feeling any of the baseball burn out at that point?

446
00:36:12.92 --> 00:36:13.92
Yeah, totally, I had it

447
00:36:14.92 --> 00:36:15.92
You had it, you had it, you had it

448
00:36:16.92 --> 00:36:19.92
You had it, you had it, you had it

449
00:36:20.92 --> 00:36:21.92
Now the reality of it is in high school, I was still super serious about it

450
00:36:22.92 --> 00:36:24.92
Once I hit Junior College, I was less serious about it

451
00:36:25.92 --> 00:36:27.92
And didn't even, wasn't even that great, I don't think

452
00:36:28.92 --> 00:36:30.92
And that actually, what would happen to Cal Rift get over here

453
00:36:31.92 --> 00:36:34.92
You know, you started, I don't know, he started smoking weed

454
00:36:34.92 --> 00:36:36.92
I was just drinking in the summer, you know?

455
00:36:37.92 --> 00:36:39.92
I mean at that level, if the vision one, everyone goes to

456
00:36:40.92 --> 00:36:44.92
Alaska or somewhere, somewhere, far off place, playing summer ball all the time

457
00:36:45.92 --> 00:36:48.92
And I never did that ever, I would just surf and hang out with 20th Street

458
00:36:49.92 --> 00:36:52.92
With my buddies, and then, you know, they're gonna move, and I come back from summer

459
00:36:53.92 --> 00:36:55.92
They're like, you ain't a shape, you know, right?

460
00:36:56.92 --> 00:36:59.92
Yeah, it wasn't, I had kind of lost the love for it a little bit

461
00:37:00.92 --> 00:37:01.92
But then when they went there in the paper, my college education

462
00:37:01.92 --> 00:37:04.92
And then when I met some all-star game, and I went off, you know,

463
00:37:05.92 --> 00:37:07.92
I hit like a home run in two doubles or something like that

464
00:37:08.92 --> 00:37:12.92
So that I could move well for a big person and I got a scholarship out of that

465
00:37:13.92 --> 00:37:15.92
And so I was like, well, okay, a couple more years, it's not gonna hurt anybody

466
00:37:16.92 --> 00:37:17.92
You know, it was actually really fun

467
00:37:18.92 --> 00:37:21.92
So then you, so when you got your guitar, you're still in high school

468
00:37:22.92 --> 00:37:24.92
And you're immediately writing songs like you had that

469
00:37:24.92 --> 00:37:30.92
You had that thought that I kind of, for my interpretation of that thought is

470
00:37:31.92 --> 00:37:33.92
It's a pain to try and learn what someone else is doing

471
00:37:34.92 --> 00:37:37.92
But if I just make something up, then it's a little leisure, was there any of that there?

472
00:37:38.92 --> 00:37:40.92
It may, and that's like the story of my old existence

473
00:37:41.92 --> 00:37:43.92
It's kind of just the easiest path to something, I feel like, oh,

474
00:37:44.92 --> 00:37:46.92
Really try that hard to be doing that, you know?

475
00:37:47.92 --> 00:37:49.92
And I'm assuming you never took any lessons or anything?

476
00:37:50.92 --> 00:37:52.92
No, I never took any lessons, I mean, the first song I wrote, I wrote a song

477
00:37:52.92 --> 00:37:58.92
And I knew, and I knew, like, E minor and NG, and then wrote a song

478
00:37:59.92 --> 00:38:01.92
Like about suicide or something like something super

479
00:38:02.92 --> 00:38:04.92
But like a narrative about like some guy jumping off a building or something

480
00:38:05.92 --> 00:38:07.92
And I was like, why is it? And I wasn't even that disturbed as a child

481
00:38:08.92 --> 00:38:10.92
I was like, pretty, I was pretty happy going lucky

482
00:38:11.92 --> 00:38:14.92
But yeah, it's immediately started writing, okay

483
00:38:15.92 --> 00:38:17.92
What was the name of the first song? It's called the jumper

484
00:38:17.92 --> 00:38:23.92
Hey, is it ever been released? No, and I was trying to remember the lyrics

485
00:38:24.92 --> 00:38:28.92
And I mean, they're not, they weren't as nearly as crafted as they are today

486
00:38:29.92 --> 00:38:33.92
Well, you got me beat because I think the first song that my band

487
00:38:34.92 --> 00:38:35.92
We had a bunch of bands when I was a kid

488
00:38:36.92 --> 00:38:40.92
And the name that we've kind of, kind of has survived is Bronson's children

489
00:38:41.92 --> 00:38:45.92
Name after Charles Bronson and even though we never made an album and even though we did record

490
00:38:45.92 --> 00:38:49.92
About 15 songs in the studio, but more important than that we made cool t-shirts

491
00:38:50.92 --> 00:38:53.92
So we've had these cool t-shirts that we have on the, we have on the joclist or

492
00:38:54.92 --> 00:38:56.92
There, there's just a picture of Bronson's face

493
00:38:57.92 --> 00:39:00.92
And then underneath and little kids like toddler writing

494
00:39:01.92 --> 00:39:05.92
It says Bronson's children, you know, if like a backwards art type thing

495
00:39:06.92 --> 00:39:09.92
But I think the first song that I can remember

496
00:39:09.92 --> 00:39:16.92
Was there was this weird televentilist dude that was on late night TV

497
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:19.92
His name was Dr. Jean Scott

498
00:39:20.92 --> 00:39:22.92
And I remember the big

499
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:25.92
Yes, that's him, that's him

500
00:39:26.92 --> 00:39:30.92
The public access, yeah, public access, yeah, he was kind of, he was kind of like one of these people

501
00:39:30.92 --> 00:39:32.92
He sort of berated the audience kind of, right?

502
00:39:33.92 --> 00:39:36.92
Right, I think he was like the gateway between like Donna, you or more in Pulitzer whatever

503
00:39:36.92 --> 00:39:41.92
That I don't even know, but anyways, we would watch him, you kind of berate his

504
00:39:42.92 --> 00:39:46.92
You know, you need to donate now, it was one of those things and there's then there's the whatever

505
00:39:47.92 --> 00:39:49.92
And so the first song

506
00:39:50.92 --> 00:39:53.92
In Bronson's children was a song called

507
00:39:54.92 --> 00:39:56.92
Dr. Scott get off the air

508
00:39:59.92 --> 00:40:01.92
Yes, and there was a great little chorus

509
00:40:01.92 --> 00:40:06.92
Where where it was get off the air and then someone was in the back would get him off the air

510
00:40:07.92 --> 00:40:09.92
Off the air there it was

511
00:40:10.92 --> 00:40:12.92
So yeah, so you were beat me man, you were already going deep early

512
00:40:13.92 --> 00:40:15.92
I went dark super early

513
00:40:16.92 --> 00:40:20.92
And then so at some point during college, so did you play your whole four years at baseball?

514
00:40:21.92 --> 00:40:23.92
Yeah, graduated four years and played all four years

515
00:40:24.92 --> 00:40:25.92
And then what what did you major in?

516
00:40:26.92 --> 00:40:27.92
History

517
00:40:27.92 --> 00:40:31.92
History was my major. Do you think in your that was that any well, was it just an easy

518
00:40:32.92 --> 00:40:38.92
Ate I had an inspiring teacher in junior college that made history interesting and so

519
00:40:39.92 --> 00:40:42.92
Decided to go that path. I don't really retain much of it

520
00:40:43.92 --> 00:40:48.92
But some of the time they see it in the songs and one other become a period piece songs that I'll write

521
00:40:50.92 --> 00:40:54.92
But yeah, not with the idea that I was going to be a teacher

522
00:40:54.92 --> 00:41:01.92
I mean, what do you really do with it right? I mean, I'm asking you that. Yeah, no I was still like, oh, I don't know what I'm going to do

523
00:41:02.92 --> 00:41:07.92
Now I got this guitar thing, oh, maybe I'll do that now, you know, how long do it take you to start thinking out man

524
00:41:08.92 --> 00:41:09.92
I can maybe make something work

525
00:41:10.92 --> 00:41:13.92
It took me a long time to even consider myself a musician I'm hardly had

526
00:41:14.92 --> 00:41:19.92
I don't know, 30 songs under my belt and would play it, you know, I would play it the pub

527
00:41:19.92 --> 00:41:23.92
I don't care how much practice did you do

528
00:41:24.92 --> 00:41:26.92
No, what you got the guitar did you

529
00:41:27.92 --> 00:41:33.92
Okay, that's awesome. No, I mean, it's still it's still a primitive. I'm still a very primitive style of playing

530
00:41:34.92 --> 00:41:36.92
There's nothing I don't really dazzle anybody with

531
00:41:38.92 --> 00:41:44.92
With my virtuosity, you know, it's just like it's the vehicle for the songs and for the voice and and

532
00:41:44.92 --> 00:41:49.92
You know, I know I do have my own style kind of up playing because it's fairly percussive

533
00:41:50.92 --> 00:41:55.92
But it's primitive, you know, I mean, I probably break strings more than anyone maybe ever

534
00:41:56.92 --> 00:41:58.92
On acoustic guitar for sure

535
00:41:59.92 --> 00:42:01.92
Pick up the guitar and you you start writing songs, you start playing songs

536
00:42:02.92 --> 00:42:06.92
But you didn't you're not one of these people that like I've known I had friends growing up where they got obsessed

537
00:42:07.92 --> 00:42:10.92
And it was they were just like learning scales and whatever the hell else you learn

538
00:42:10.92 --> 00:42:15.92
When you're trying to get a guitar which I never did I never never took lessons or never

539
00:42:16.92 --> 00:42:22.92
Yeah, and I don't it's still it took me a while to go like, oh, this is maybe what I want to do even and I just kept on writing songs

540
00:42:23.92 --> 00:42:25.92
And I started having kind of a catalog of songs

541
00:42:26.92 --> 00:42:28.92
So so when you graduate from college

542
00:42:29.92 --> 00:42:33.92
Do you, what did you do? Did you that that was a job that I waited tables?

543
00:42:34.92 --> 00:42:38.92
I waited tables. I went back and lived with my parents for a while

544
00:42:38.92 --> 00:42:42.92
To save up some money, waited tables, and then moved to San Francisco and waited tables

545
00:42:42.92 --> 00:42:47.92
And then with kind of the intention that I was going to go and start hitting the clubs and trying to make some kind of a

546
00:42:48.92 --> 00:42:53.92
Presence of my songwriting or my performance or whatever was going to be, you know

547
00:42:54.92 --> 00:42:58.92
And with the San Francisco seemed like the move for some reason

548
00:42:59.92 --> 00:43:02.92
I don't know if because it was close and proximity to where I went to

549
00:43:02.92 --> 00:43:07.92
College, I'm not sure why we chose that. I think my brother had a job there

550
00:43:08.92 --> 00:43:10.92
That was lined up and so we went there

551
00:43:11.92 --> 00:43:13.92
And lived together me my brother lived together and

552
00:43:14.92 --> 00:43:16.92
But it was shitty. It was not a good environment

553
00:43:17.92 --> 00:43:20.92
It was when DJ started taking over almost all small clubs

554
00:43:20.92 --> 00:43:31.92
We're years this is 98 to maybe 2002 I lived in San Francisco probably play once a year twice a year in the corner of some shit die bar or like in a coffee shop

555
00:43:32.92 --> 00:43:35.92
You know, smuggle some tequila and ruin the show on the second stage

556
00:43:36.92 --> 00:43:44.92
Kind of thing, but yeah, so 98 to 2002 you're up there you're playing occasionally in the back of some freaking whatever

557
00:43:44.92 --> 00:43:49.92
Yeah, you know and waiting tables to survive and

558
00:43:50.92 --> 00:43:54.92
But this was your goal your goal was be a musicians at this point?

559
00:43:55.92 --> 00:44:00.92
Yeah, but it was loose and lazy kind of and just not not realized

560
00:44:01.92 --> 00:44:08.92
I mean I used to not get gigs. I didn't have any net shit. I didn't have so I would make cassette tapes on my brother's through my brother's pioneer

561
00:44:08.92 --> 00:44:24.92
Dual cassette player through the PA through the PA and I would record and I would lay down 10 songs and then I would send him to friends and send them to family for a presence for like Christmas or or for whatever right and

562
00:44:25.92 --> 00:44:27.92
And

563
00:44:27.92 --> 00:44:29.92
I had no press

564
00:44:30.92 --> 00:44:34.92
I've picked some people open up on it. Oh, we got another freaking dick

565
00:44:34.92 --> 00:44:45.92
Oh, no, no, no, thank you. Just these going in the shit can. Oh, that's painful. So you so you're thinking or you think that's going to be a hobby. You just think hey, it's fun

566
00:44:46.92 --> 00:44:52.92
I want to do it, but I'm not I don't have the know how or maybe the drive really to really know

567
00:44:53.92 --> 00:45:00.92
What I'm doing and my brother was my manager had something to do so and shit, but we have found this old tape and it had a

568
00:45:00.92 --> 00:45:06.92
We had this little band in in in Huntington Beach like right one out of the been playing guitar for like

569
00:45:07.92 --> 00:45:12.36
Six months maybe and these guys heard me singing that like holy shit like let's start a band and they wouldn't go

570
00:45:12.92 --> 00:45:15.92
Basically, I play drums when we started a band called the living room right. This is

571
00:45:16.92 --> 00:45:24.92
Really, but you're not a good man started in the living room as well. You know, so there was all this is silly and we're fucking terrible and

572
00:45:25.92 --> 00:45:27.92
But on the cassette

573
00:45:27.92 --> 00:45:35.92
It says living room and then boom no, there's no title to the whatever the little EP thing is only cassettes by the way and

574
00:45:36.92 --> 00:45:42.92
Matt Smith my brother's name and his his phone number big multiple times on the

575
00:45:43.92 --> 00:45:45.92
It's like it looks

576
00:45:45.92 --> 00:45:48.92
Pretty proud. We're like we'll just look for that number

577
00:45:48.92 --> 00:45:54.92
I don't right. They're like wow, let's see. Let's get must have a bunch of clients brother

578
00:45:55.92 --> 00:46:02.92
So I'm still trying to figure this out right you're in San Francisco. It seems like you are very persistent

579
00:46:02.92 --> 00:46:06.92
But not very focused or maybe something like that or is it just you just didn't know what to do?

580
00:46:06.92 --> 00:46:11.92
I was I was passionate about writing songs and I would keep writing songs. So these

581
00:46:11.92 --> 00:46:18.92
Laffable cassettes that I was saying were making their way down. So I actually had a buddy who's in the surf industry

582
00:46:19.92 --> 00:46:25.92
And he was a rep for for some surf companies and these cassette tapes started going to other people

583
00:46:26.92 --> 00:46:28.92
He would give one to one and then they would make go go cassette

584
00:46:29.92 --> 00:46:31.92
To cassette you know old school viral

585
00:46:32.92 --> 00:46:33.92
School viral right

586
00:46:33.92 --> 00:46:38.92
Jack Smith as as much as it could be and that but way to second. I'm just going to confirm this. We're in 1998

587
00:46:38.92 --> 00:46:44.92
Or it's 2000 this is before that. Oh, this before that when I was making the cassettes and going to them out

588
00:46:45.92 --> 00:46:51.92
So this was the this was one my couple junior college years. I think that I was creating these cassettes and they were kind of

589
00:46:52.92 --> 00:46:58.92
Go moving around but I was unaware that other people were listening to them or the people were making duplicates of this

590
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:03.92
And then I got a call from one of the guys shelter guy who made shelter Christmas

591
00:47:03.92 --> 00:47:09.92
Chris from one of the living in San Francisco and he said hey, I want to use one of your songs and one of my surf films

592
00:47:10.92 --> 00:47:16.92
And I was like what like how do you know you didn't know him at the time? I didn't know him. No, oh, this was one of the

593
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:23.92
And this was one of just the cassette one to this guy to this guy and then he ended up with one and one of the songs he said he wanted to use

594
00:47:24.92 --> 00:47:26.92
off this one of these cassettes

595
00:47:26.92 --> 00:47:37.92
And I was like why you know because I was used to you know surf films were airs and punk and fast as music and they're like he's like, you know we're making this kind of more

596
00:47:38.92 --> 00:47:43.92
Artie thing and it was just me and acoustic guitar and was wrong. Yeah, it was wrong. Was it song

597
00:47:43.92 --> 00:47:56.92
And then that yeah, that was like a soul kind of yeah, there was a story and there was a shelter flick and the myloid brothers are all cool guys or

598
00:47:59.92 --> 00:48:09.92
So that happens and then all of a sudden, does that give you a little that is barato like that didn't even that didn't give me the

599
00:48:09.92 --> 00:48:16.92
That gave me a little validation and said like oh yeah, maybe I'm doing the right they're doing something this is maybe something to pursue harder

600
00:48:17.92 --> 00:48:19.92
They asked me to come and play the

601
00:48:20.92 --> 00:48:26.92
All these are just you and your guitar. Oh, yeah, there's no band no band just me solo and that's part partially of how why I play guitar the way I do

602
00:48:27.92 --> 00:48:34.92
Because I used to just fill the space with everything not with new toling but just with strumming and there's a lot of up down and percussive stuff

603
00:48:34.92 --> 00:48:37.92
And then they asked me to play the

604
00:48:38.92 --> 00:48:46.92
The premiere of the movie down in San Diego so I come down and I play whatever 30 minutes before the movie and I see people

605
00:48:47.92 --> 00:48:50.92
Singing along to other songs

606
00:48:50.92 --> 00:48:53.92
Of mine from these silly cassettes

607
00:48:53.92 --> 00:49:00.92
Right and I'm like what is going what is this and I don't shit going on San Francisco my brother had gone off and was like

608
00:49:00.92 --> 00:49:05.92
Working at the Olympics or something so he had left San Francisco and I had this like drunk as roommate

609
00:49:06.92 --> 00:49:13.92
And I packed my shit up and quit my job and then moved down to Southern California and then started kind of fresh a little

610
00:49:14.92 --> 00:49:16.92
A little focus but not focus to

611
00:49:16.92 --> 00:49:18.92
You know and then that's

612
00:49:18.92 --> 00:49:23.92
It was a long road you know a lot of couches then it was just couches then I didn't have another job

613
00:49:23.92 --> 00:49:31.92
So wait, so then you you said I missed it you moved to San Diego or you moved to LA I moved to Orange County to Orange County. Yeah, the surf industry in there

614
00:49:32.92 --> 00:49:35.92
Yeah, it was a weird I mean for the

615
00:49:36.92 --> 00:49:43.92
The variety of songs I write which many of them are quite dark or at least emotional visceral in a way

616
00:49:44.92 --> 00:49:50.92
That the surf industry I thought was odd kind of placed up to pick it up and pick up you know

617
00:49:50.92 --> 00:49:53.92
Go like oh yeah, this is you know

618
00:49:53.92 --> 00:49:57.92
This might make you cry. Let's put that in the surf film, you know

619
00:49:58.92 --> 00:50:02.92
It was it was an odd place to start I thought at least to get what you was it that you moved down here

620
00:50:03.92 --> 00:50:07.92
2002. Oh, okay. What year did shelter come out

621
00:50:08.92 --> 00:50:16.92
Probably around then okay, I bet it's that same time it was pretty all the way after after I that happened

622
00:50:16.92 --> 00:50:21.92
I was like oh shit. I didn't just nothing was happening and I'd been in San Francisco for four years nothing was going to happen in San Francisco

623
00:50:22.92 --> 00:50:27.92
You know, I wasn't I was idle I was too idle and I needed something to push myself

624
00:50:29.92 --> 00:50:33.92
And so I need to do the make a change so you get down here then then what's the next step now?

625
00:50:34.92 --> 00:50:39.92
You're not not waiting cables anymore are you somehow getting by and hardly though. I mean like

626
00:50:39.92 --> 00:50:46.92
Playing every other Wednesday at the sushi bar and C.O.B.H. and playing in the corner this bar

627
00:50:47.92 --> 00:50:53.92
B.Q. restaurant in San Ana and just like take jar out tip jar making you know

628
00:50:54.92 --> 00:50:58.92
Between 50 and 300 bucks a pop and sleeping on people's couches

629
00:50:59.92 --> 00:51:02.92
State of my buddy's house for like maybe a year and a half in their guest room. That's a buddy

630
00:51:03.92 --> 00:51:06.92
Super my main is a beautiful man. It's got Mars

631
00:51:06.92 --> 00:51:11.92
Yeah, I'm grateful for that time because it really allowed me to

632
00:51:12.92 --> 00:51:18.92
I don't know. It allowed me to least craft what I was doing and at least get some

633
00:51:20.92 --> 00:51:25.92
Stage time performance time before anything was really happening

634
00:51:26.92 --> 00:51:31.92
And so how long were you in that situation before once the first time you went into a studio and recorded

635
00:51:31.92 --> 00:51:38.92
Not on a pioneer tape day. It was after so as after shelter came out

636
00:51:41.92 --> 00:51:46.92
Those same cassettes had gotten to the guy Bob Hurley who owns Hurley

637
00:51:47.92 --> 00:51:52.92
And he paid for me to make my first album and I actually made it with this a surfer up in

638
00:51:53.92 --> 00:51:55.92
Our in San Diego Peter King. I don't know

639
00:51:55.92 --> 00:52:02.92
He had a home studio at his house and I made my first album which was Hocked at like a rodeo

640
00:52:03.92 --> 00:52:08.92
Which I discontinued and re-did at some point in my career because I wasn't totally

641
00:52:09.92 --> 00:52:12.92
Loving how it turned out because I was super green and then I've been in studio

642
00:52:13.92 --> 00:52:18.92
Only knew the pioneer you know and it was more than a record button right echo Charles take

643
00:52:19.92 --> 00:52:23.92
Right, yeah, yeah, play in the court at the same time. That's a game record at the same time

644
00:52:23.92 --> 00:52:25.92
Okay, there was some complications

645
00:52:26.92 --> 00:52:31.92
What happened to that album like what happened that album that you fell like you lost control of it a little

646
00:52:32.92 --> 00:52:34.92
Did they go and overproduced or something or they like to

647
00:52:35.92 --> 00:52:40.92
Jim you know Jimmy on the freaking league guitar and it's Fender and here and start cranking out

648
00:52:41.92 --> 00:52:46.92
I mean I was raw and I liked kind of some of the rawness and it seemed to get a little to

649
00:52:47.92 --> 00:52:50.92
Produced in a way I would just like leave

650
00:52:50.92 --> 00:52:55.92
Leave town I would go somewhere and visit some people and then they would have musicians would come in and play on it

651
00:52:56.92 --> 00:53:01.92
And then they'd be like hey check this out and I'd be like oh, you know, it wasn't I wasn't at the command at all

652
00:53:02.92 --> 00:53:06.92
That's weird. It was out of my hands, which is normally which is that was the only time I really made that

653
00:53:07.92 --> 00:53:11.92
Mistake you know, but you live in your learn and it happens dance to look back and go like

654
00:53:12.92 --> 00:53:15.92
You know you discontinued and then you re-recorded it later

655
00:53:15.92 --> 00:53:20.92
Which seems like it was a moment in time and even if I was green I think the songs were still good

656
00:53:21.92 --> 00:53:27.92
Why I re-recorded it and discontinued that other one. I don't know why but you can find you try to find that one

657
00:53:27.92 --> 00:53:31.92
Like there's some like Japanese sites and stuff that will have that CD which I weren't that many of them because they were just like

658
00:53:32.92 --> 00:53:39.92
They're like five hundred bucks or something just stupid, you know for this well and you could probably get it on the internet

659
00:53:39.92 --> 00:53:46.92
Internet just in the web so that's the first album that comes out. Does it come out? Is that the right word?

660
00:53:46.92 --> 00:53:50.92
No, even come out or was it just like hey, we're making it. We're it doesn't come out. I sell it. It shows

661
00:53:51.92 --> 00:53:57.92
That's it, you know, we have this kind of fictitious label that Bob and this guy Paul Gomez make and it is

662
00:54:00.92 --> 00:54:03.92
Yeah nothing really happens. I'm still playing with the sushi bar

663
00:54:03.92 --> 00:54:13.92
Doing that for and I was in that state for quite some time. You know, like two years two years of sushi bar

664
00:54:14.92 --> 00:54:16.92
Sushi bar tip jar

665
00:54:17.92 --> 00:54:22.92
Then what what happened from there that got you away from the sushi bar the tip jar

666
00:54:23.92 --> 00:54:25.92
It was

667
00:54:25.92 --> 00:54:32.92
I met I think I moved up because I met my my wife and I moved up to

668
00:54:33.92 --> 00:54:37.92
Los Angeles and met some people got kind of a manager

669
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:42.92
And we went in the studio and recorded my first EP

670
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:48.92
This is just the white buffalo and it's yet. I think it's five six songs on that

671
00:54:49.92 --> 00:54:51.92
Which was super stripped down now?

672
00:54:51.92 --> 00:54:55.92
Now, was this who's who's paying for this?

673
00:54:56.92 --> 00:54:58.92
Who is running? Who bought you studio time?

674
00:54:59.92 --> 00:55:00.92
This was a

675
00:55:01.92 --> 00:55:03.92
My manager at the time was managing

676
00:55:04.92 --> 00:55:06.92
Donovan Frankenrider

677
00:55:07.92 --> 00:55:12.92
And I so I would open up for him. I started opening up for him and I would get some exposure doing that

678
00:55:13.92 --> 00:55:16.92
And met the keyboard player this guy who actually played for the eels as well

679
00:55:17.92 --> 00:55:18.92
Rusty

680
00:55:18.92 --> 00:55:23.92
He went by cool G murder and he was kind of he had that steep whatever

681
00:55:24.92 --> 00:55:29.92
But he's like he's red head of that's big like ginger beard kind of like wispy

682
00:55:30.92 --> 00:55:35.92
You know, not a whole lot of hair and a column of self cool to use cool she was cool

683
00:55:36.92 --> 00:55:43.92
Cool G murder. It says if you look like if you had that EP and you looked on produce by it says produce my cool G murder

684
00:55:43.92 --> 00:55:50.92
Oh, I will check that out. So that so you record this thing

685
00:55:51.92 --> 00:55:53.92
We're are we still pre like internet

686
00:55:54.92 --> 00:56:02.92
Whatever MP3 situations. Yeah, we're still sales are still yeah, I don't know for digital

687
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:06.92
Yeah, I don't know are we I don't know if those iTunes and that stuff had been

688
00:56:06.92 --> 00:56:14.92
I don't know either I don't think so because I think they date that EP on iTunes is something way later than it

689
00:56:15.92 --> 00:56:21.92
Actually was proud of you know, so so when that album comes out is it what happens this is freaking awesome

690
00:56:22.92 --> 00:56:27.92
Just no factor. I independently release it myself and it's just me selling it basically at

691
00:56:28.92 --> 00:56:33.92
Uh, shows and I think when the digital format comes up I get it up on there and I'm

692
00:56:33.92 --> 00:56:40.92
That's it nothing is happening. I ended up doing that for a couple so you're in that state still

693
00:56:41.92 --> 00:56:46.92
I mean, and it's still a couple albums and then I'd put a couple more albums out doing that in that state almost hand

694
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:50.92
What at what point did you start to feel some forward moment?

695
00:56:51.92 --> 00:56:56.92
Like I was saying earlier man, I went and saw you at UCSD and like a little cafe and there's 15 people in there

696
00:56:56.92 --> 00:57:05.92
And I was actually like me my wife her friends our friends. We're all sitting there. Yeah, and everybody's I remember that and everyone's like sitting in the

697
00:57:06.92 --> 00:57:15.92
And I'm super stoked. I'm like this is so rad, you know, I'm like, yeah, I mean it's been just this super long haul of

698
00:57:16.92 --> 00:57:21.92
Not too many spikes. I mean later. I'm starting later. I mean it's not until I get

699
00:57:21.92 --> 00:57:23.92
Um

700
00:57:23.92 --> 00:57:29.92
You know probably start starting the actual TV licenses where stuff starts getting more serious

701
00:57:30.92 --> 00:57:32.92
That doesn't come until what year I

702
00:57:34.92 --> 00:57:38.92
Was still independent didn't have I had hogtied

703
00:57:38.92 --> 00:57:52.92
Revisited now under my belt was a full length album and two EPs and I didn't have a manager didn't have booking agent anything and my lawyer

704
00:57:53.92 --> 00:57:58.92
As the music supervisor for sons of anarchy to lunch and said hey, I got this guy

705
00:57:59.92 --> 00:58:02.92
You're right some murder songs and conflicted emotional songs

706
00:58:03.92 --> 00:58:06.92
You know that that and

707
00:58:06.92 --> 00:58:13.92
When you're in that state so you're in this state like there's got to be a point. There's got to be a thought that goes through your mind of

708
00:58:14.92 --> 00:58:20.92
All right, you know like this ain't gonna work. I got to I got to figure out how I got to feed my family

709
00:58:21.92 --> 00:58:23.92
I got to figure out how I'm gonna get a mortgage. I got to figure out how I'm gonna buy a house

710
00:58:25.92 --> 00:58:30.92
Was that font in your mind or was it a good when you get in by enough where you have it?

711
00:58:30.92 --> 00:58:35.92
I mean you obviously love playing live at least as far as I can tell you freaking love playing live

712
00:58:36.92 --> 00:58:40.92
Is that a good enough time we're like hey, this is a cool job right now, and I'm good with it

713
00:58:41.92 --> 00:58:47.92
It was very small means and and I we didn't need that money much money to survive really at that point

714
00:58:50.92 --> 00:58:52.92
I remember I got off

715
00:58:53.92 --> 00:58:55.92
Another surf movie I did

716
00:58:55.92 --> 00:58:59.92
This one from Jason Baffa called single thin yellow and I did a

717
00:59:02.92 --> 00:59:09.92
A little piece off that and that was the first time I've ever like wrote to picture one of the only times actually and I came up with that song and that idea

718
00:59:10.92 --> 00:59:17.92
And then I I re did it and recorded it on my first EP and create made it into it more of a song

719
00:59:18.92 --> 00:59:22.92
When before was just this thing they used that person that that piece

720
00:59:22.92 --> 00:59:29.92
Like Walmart called me for a commercial had a nowhere to I didn't have a publisher. They thought I was a publisher and

721
00:59:30.92 --> 00:59:32.92
Quoted me some money there. You give me I was like oh

722
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:34.92
Chacha

723
00:59:35.92 --> 00:59:37.92
I was like oh, Mark I was like no, look yeah, what I'm

724
00:59:38.92 --> 00:59:41.92
And then and then I went that Walmart money saw

725
00:59:42.92 --> 00:59:48.92
But then I remember I was like oh, let me you know, I don't want to shoot myself in the foot. Let me pass it on to my manager at the time, right?

726
00:59:48.92 --> 00:59:55.92
It was pretty green hands up getting less money. So I had negotiated initially. That's because that's but still

727
00:59:56.92 --> 00:59:57.92
But it was more it was

728
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:03.92
It was more money than I'd ever seen and it was like oh, okay, here's you know

729
01:00:04.92 --> 01:00:07.92
I could have lived off that that was more money than I'd made probably in the previous four years

730
01:00:08.92 --> 01:00:13.52
You know, I'm doing of doing the music so you are getting it's like it's like you're uh

731
01:00:13.52 --> 01:00:20.52
You know when you were a kid and you had some girlfriend and like she would break up with you, but she would string you along right

732
01:00:21.52 --> 01:00:26.52
You know that and people say don't string don't string people along. It's like you were getting strong along by

733
01:00:27.52 --> 01:00:31.52
I mean, they're a little carrot. Yeah, you know, another good. I made some good tips tonight

734
01:00:32.52 --> 01:00:34.52
I'm gonna get the big golf and Walmart. It's all like hockey.

735
01:00:37.52 --> 01:00:39.52
So then so that was from single thing yellow

736
01:00:39.52 --> 01:00:45.52
Which is a kick ass movie. They take this board and they send it around the world a bunch of different people surfer a bunch of different wild spots

737
01:00:48.52 --> 01:00:50.52
But this is still

738
01:00:52.52 --> 01:00:57.52
Still you're not you know able to just or are you able to just survive on on being a musician at this point?

739
01:00:58.52 --> 01:01:01.52
Yeah, and I was I had been for for a bit. I did

740
01:01:02.52 --> 01:01:04.52
Use my college degree for a little substitute teaching

741
01:01:04.52 --> 01:01:10.52
Which was hilarious. Oh, man. I'm a very spoken of heartbreaking at the same time. Why do you say that?

742
01:01:11.52 --> 01:01:13.52
You know

743
01:01:14.52 --> 01:01:22.52
Middle school kids are pretty dangerous. You know, I pretty confused and pissed and so I ended breaking up more fights than I was

744
01:01:23.52 --> 01:01:26.52
Teaching anybody anything or you know, I mean, I wasn't

745
01:01:27.52 --> 01:01:29.52
There's not much of a

746
01:01:29.52 --> 01:01:33.52
Lesson plan often left for the substitute teacher

747
01:01:34.52 --> 01:01:37.52
So you're sure movie or you're just trying to keep the kids safe

748
01:01:38.52 --> 01:01:42.52
You're gonna say don't get don't get thrown out the window. It's the lesson plan, right?

749
01:01:43.52 --> 01:01:46.52
So but I didn't do that that that long or very very

750
01:01:47.52 --> 01:01:48.52
Very often

751
01:01:49.52 --> 01:01:56.52
When you're in these when you're in this period of your life, I mean, the songs that you write to music that you write the lyrics that you write

752
01:01:56.52 --> 01:01:58.52
I'm

753
01:01:59.52 --> 01:02:08.52
I'm projecting my thoughts onto this, but you know, when you're sitting and working in a dive bar somewhere playing a gig and you look over in the corner and you see this character

754
01:02:09.52 --> 01:02:15.52
Is does that develop into hey, you know, I know what that guy's thinking or I'm thinking about what that person's life was like that.

755
01:02:16.52 --> 01:02:20.52
Is it good that you went through this time period of of where you were kind of

756
01:02:20.52 --> 01:02:24.52
You're struggling through and making things happen, did you?

757
01:02:25.52 --> 01:02:28.52
Does that incorporate into your, do things you think about?

758
01:02:29.52 --> 01:02:32.52
I mean, I honestly think the way that I did it

759
01:02:33.52 --> 01:02:37.52
Was beneficial to me as a songwriter as an artist for this long of a time

760
01:02:38.52 --> 01:02:43.52
That if I would have had somebody come in and go like, hey, wow, this guy's you can sing and he writes he's pretty good songs

761
01:02:44.52 --> 01:02:47.52
But like we can, why don't we develop this guy into something else and do a country store or something else

762
01:02:47.52 --> 01:02:54.52
And instead I was able to be 100% true to the songs that I write that artists that I wanted to be

763
01:02:55.52 --> 01:02:58.52
And never had to do anything that I didn't want to do

764
01:02:59.52 --> 01:03:02.52
It always my vision and always 100% from me, which is

765
01:03:03.52 --> 01:03:10.52
Super rare these days, especially I mean there's like, you know, the song on the radio you got 15 people wrote it, you know, it's like

766
01:03:10.52 --> 01:03:17.52
It's kind of unheard of and but I think that this super long haul that it's taken me and even now I'm still a

767
01:03:18.52 --> 01:03:22.52
Little secret, you know, it's not like I'm a superstar her people know I'm like walk down the street

768
01:03:23.52 --> 01:03:31.52
It's like rare for me to get noticed, you know, I'm always kind of put off by somebody going like, hey, are you, are you the

769
01:03:32.52 --> 01:03:36.52
Oh, yeah, I am, I'll be like, oh shit, you know, I love people that really like me really like me

770
01:03:36.52 --> 01:03:40.52
But most people don't know about me, you know, which I'm kind of, it's a sweet spot

771
01:03:41.52 --> 01:03:46.52
Kind of for me, I mean I'm not making millions of dollars, but I'm doing okay, I can survive and I'm provide

772
01:03:48.52 --> 01:03:50.52
But I'm not

773
01:03:52.52 --> 01:03:59.52
You know, I don't I can still be me do what I want to do and not be, you know, afraid to go out and public it all

774
01:04:00.52 --> 01:04:02.52
That's that's good

775
01:04:02.52 --> 01:04:04.52
Does

776
01:04:04.52 --> 01:04:11.52
So you were just getting to the point where I cut you off and redirected the story and it totally different direction because that was really cool

777
01:04:12.52 --> 01:04:14.52
But you're talking about

778
01:04:15.52 --> 01:04:19.52
You're so you got this manager guy and he knows

779
01:04:22.52 --> 01:04:25.52
The musician director from Sons of Anarchy

780
01:04:25.52 --> 01:04:31.52
That was actually post so I had my first guy and I first manager, he's actually my second manager

781
01:04:32.52 --> 01:04:38.52
Who was managing down of in Frank or Adder and I ended up touring with him for probably a year and a half when I was with him

782
01:04:39.52 --> 01:04:45.52
It went to Japan when all over the world and this was when he was he peaked when dawn of him is kind of peaking and

783
01:04:46.52 --> 01:04:48.52
When you just live in the dream

784
01:04:49.52 --> 01:04:53.52
I mean let me travel on the bus, I was like, you know, we weren't in the sushi bar anymore, you know, they'll do it

785
01:04:53.52 --> 01:04:55.52
Bro

786
01:04:55.52 --> 01:04:58.52
So you just to see the world when you're seeing the world and you get perspectives and different

787
01:04:59.52 --> 01:05:05.52
You know, you over the open-chair mind traveling when I was in the sealed teams I was on deployment when I would be on deployment

788
01:05:06.52 --> 01:05:09.52
I would know in my mind like every day

789
01:05:09.52 --> 01:05:16.52
I would know that this was the best you know, I was kind of just loving life you know living

790
01:05:16.52 --> 01:05:24.52
You don't people always say living in the dream I was living the dream I was actually doing exactly what I always dreamed of doing from my whole life

791
01:05:25.52 --> 01:05:26.52
What's amazing

792
01:05:27.52 --> 01:05:29.52
Seems like that's what would be you know you be on tour

793
01:05:30.52 --> 01:05:34.52
It was I just had low I didn't have and I maybe that's my been my outlook

794
01:05:35.52 --> 01:05:39.52
A lot of the time to kind of have low expectations and then not be really that disappointed

795
01:05:39.52 --> 01:05:52.52
And even when I'm not getting accolades or I'm not getting you know playing huge rooms or or but making enough money to be okay and feel pretty okay about what I'm doing and still being true to myself

796
01:05:53.52 --> 01:05:56.52
It was enough and it's always kind of been enough for me

797
01:05:57.52 --> 01:06:00.52
Okay, so you get a pretty good launch you get a taste of the road

798
01:06:01.52 --> 01:06:02.52
Right?

799
01:06:02.52 --> 01:06:05.52
Get a taste of the road bro you're there

800
01:06:05.52 --> 01:06:11.52
And and then did that when you get done touring with that tour what's the next step?

801
01:06:14.52 --> 01:06:21.52
You know we started I know we were at we were at that moment I'm probably

802
01:06:22.52 --> 01:06:29.52
The next big step is getting the sons of anarchy still for sure that that that put me in a place

803
01:06:29.52 --> 01:06:39.52
Where now I could go well after the show really I was like the third season I think they started using my stuff and how I'm so so I was you I cut once again

804
01:06:40.52 --> 01:06:42.52
I just cut you offering them we instead hey, let's take a sip

805
01:06:43.52 --> 01:06:45.52
So how did that come about that that you ended up on sons of anarchy?

806
01:06:46.52 --> 01:06:49.52
No, so as my lawyer Steve Sessa who I still have today

807
01:06:50.52 --> 01:06:56.52
Invited the music super badge of the lunch and said listen I have this guy's an unsight artist doesn't have any management does anything

808
01:06:56.52 --> 01:07:06.52
But son of son albums I think he was a big fan of the show of sons of anarchy and he's like you know the conflict in these you know it's like this show is basically these

809
01:07:07.52 --> 01:07:11.52
Emotional men doing kind of terrible shit

810
01:07:12.52 --> 01:07:20.52
You know and I have a lot of that kind of conflict and some of my songs too that it's something that's got it that feels like kind of a badass but got he's maybe kind of a sweetheart

811
01:07:20.52 --> 01:07:26.52
I think or you feel for this guy who's really it's a murder song, you know, but you're he's kind of the hero though at the same time

812
01:07:27.52 --> 01:07:29.52
So it's this conflict to him

813
01:07:30.52 --> 01:07:32.52
Was perfect for that show and then

814
01:07:34.52 --> 01:07:40.52
He gave him gave my whole catalog basically and then and not that long at all they were like okay here

815
01:07:41.52 --> 01:07:44.52
We're gonna use this in the next and you know in three episodes or something and

816
01:07:44.52 --> 01:07:51.52
And but that was a slow thing as well, you know that was they'd use us one song and then these and other song, but then they ended up using

817
01:07:53.52 --> 01:07:58.52
I think seven or eight of my own songs that I they were my own compositions that were already out there

818
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:06.52
And then they had become in sing on stuff so stuff that they would create that was part of the soundtrack and just how they used music in that show

819
01:08:07.52 --> 01:08:10.52
I don't know if you watched it, but it was very we do these montages at the end

820
01:08:10.52 --> 01:08:21.52
That would be the song would be part of the story and it would just be these montages visuals and they would play the song at full length at full volume

821
01:08:22.52 --> 01:08:27.52
And it would be like another character and then I think people started recognizing my voice and saying

822
01:08:28.52 --> 01:08:35.52
What does this make me should go deeper you know into this and at that point we had I hadn't been to Europe on my own as an artist

823
01:08:35.52 --> 01:08:39.52
I don't the open up for people and you don't really know what kind of

824
01:08:40.52 --> 01:08:48.52
Lengues you have in places you don't know when you don't have any history in places and if you just open up for somebody you don't really have history is really you're just playing for their people

825
01:08:49.52 --> 01:08:51.52
So then

826
01:08:51.52 --> 01:09:00.52
Shit's going better and getting better and we go how we gotta go we gotta check out Europe. I don't know what's happening. You know starting to play bigger rooms all over the country and

827
01:09:01.52 --> 01:09:03.52
Nobody old

828
01:09:03.52 --> 01:09:09.52
No, no clubs who want us they never heard of us, you know, no, and we were like well least we've you know we got a festival somewhere

829
01:09:10.52 --> 01:09:16.52
So we're like okay, we're gonna play this festival in Spain or something so but we gotta try to play in London and just see what tickets are like see what happens

830
01:09:17.52 --> 01:09:20.52
So we play this like a little tiny room. We're gonna play like a 200 cap room that sells out like an hour

831
01:09:21.52 --> 01:09:27.52
They're like oh shit. Well, they're like what's going on and then they like well let's bump up the room and then they bump it up to like 700 capacity

832
01:09:27.52 --> 01:09:35.52
Which was bigger than I'm playing most of the places in the States and then that sells out another hour day and then they're like wow it's going on and then that

833
01:09:35.52 --> 01:09:41.52
So we just went and we played a couple shows in Europe and then realized like okay, this is a viable market

834
01:09:41.52 --> 01:09:47.02
Like we can make some money over here and then we have a fan base and I think almost due to the popularity that show

835
01:09:48.52 --> 01:09:51.52
You know at that point I sign with a label

836
01:09:51.52 --> 01:09:55.52
You know small kind of boutique label which basically was

837
01:09:55.52 --> 01:10:00.52
These two guys that that were producers and engineers who produced an engineered

838
01:10:01.52 --> 01:10:03.52
Four albums

839
01:10:03.52 --> 01:10:10.52
I just just have left now. I'm on with it different. What made you decide to go? Why did you need you've been doing it yourself?

840
01:10:10.52 --> 01:10:12.52
Why made you make the transition it was not

841
01:10:12.52 --> 01:10:24.52
I didn't I never had any even though there wasn't a much of a machine behind those other albums and still now not really

842
01:10:25.52 --> 01:10:27.52
I just wanted to get in the game

843
01:10:27.52 --> 01:10:29.52
You know what I mean? I'd never been in the game

844
01:10:29.52 --> 01:10:36.52
You know and I was just like I'm just an island. I'm still kind of an island, but then I was like I wasn't in the game

845
01:10:36.52 --> 01:10:39.52
You know and they're like I think somebody was just like do you get the game?

846
01:10:39.52 --> 01:10:43.52
What are you doing? Like you know on the labels you know, it wasn't like I had

847
01:10:44.52 --> 01:10:47.52
That know how or any of the anything when I'm independently releasing things

848
01:10:47.52 --> 01:10:49.52
No, but it wasn't like it was fucking six months set up

849
01:10:50.52 --> 01:10:56.52
To be like alright the albums gonna come out may you know 20th then we're gonna be promoting this thing for no

850
01:10:56.52 --> 01:11:00.52
It was when it was done. What's a marketing plan looking at the front next album there was nothing

851
01:11:00.52 --> 01:11:05.52
I would just go up. It would just put it up. It would be I finished something and then I would just put it up

852
01:11:05.52 --> 01:11:12.52
You know digitally and and make CDs so then you sign with these guys. Is that the right terminology?

853
01:11:12.52 --> 01:11:17.52
Yeah, yeah, and we did like a three album four album deal with them

854
01:11:19.52 --> 01:11:21.52
Are you the

855
01:11:22.52 --> 01:11:24.52
Is this all your decision making you're the guy?

856
01:11:27.52 --> 01:11:29.52
Yeah, I end up getting my manager

857
01:11:29.52 --> 01:11:36.52
Right when I was signing I was looking for somebody else. I was like in between that. I think I'd have like three different managers who were all

858
01:11:38.52 --> 01:11:40.52
I don't know if they had like they were

859
01:11:41.52 --> 01:11:52.52
I just did but they weren't as professional or as right for me. I'll just say that they weren't if they weren't maybe right for me to try to get me to the another plateau

860
01:11:52.52 --> 01:11:58.52
And now I got the Jeff Farney who's great and and smart and political and

861
01:12:00.52 --> 01:12:05.52
Also though very in my corners far still allowing me to

862
01:12:06.52 --> 01:12:08.52
Have my vision and do what I want to do musically

863
01:12:11.52 --> 01:12:13.52
So right right before that

864
01:12:14.52 --> 01:12:18.52
We do the deal I sign with him as well. All right. I bring him on as my manager

865
01:12:18.52 --> 01:12:24.52
Mm-hmm, then with him ever since and then you that's somehow your officially in the game now your son out places in Europe

866
01:12:25.52 --> 01:12:33.52
But what does it look back when you get back to the States because it's weird. You know, it's weird how that can happen and I got some other friends and better musicians and like overseas

867
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:40.52
They're freaking massive and back here. There's just not not action. I mean, it's it's crazy and I don't even know

868
01:12:41.52 --> 01:12:44.52
Some markets. I mean, we've never been to South America. Like if you look on my comments

869
01:12:44.52 --> 01:12:51.52
You look on any YouTube thing I have every other comment has come to Brazil or something Brazil, but there we've never been to Brazil. It's far

870
01:12:52.52 --> 01:12:57.52
So it's got you right. I don't know when we'll get there. I want to get there

871
01:12:58.52 --> 01:13:04.12
You know, but we're doing better. It's a slow build. We never go down

872
01:13:04.52 --> 01:13:09.52
You know, which I appreciate but still in places like the South we haven't had that much touring history

873
01:13:09.52 --> 01:13:16.52
It probably done like two or three tours there and we're still building that it is it weird because

874
01:13:17.52 --> 01:13:26.52
How do you categorize your music? That's part of the issue and that's an issue with labels some of the time too because they don't understand it

875
01:13:27.52 --> 01:13:32.52
It doesn't fit in an email category, you know, even you have this Americana idea now, but it doesn't it's not

876
01:13:33.52 --> 01:13:35.52
Air quotes

877
01:13:35.52 --> 01:13:44.52
I don't know, it just it doesn't seem I don't know it feels like I don't belong in that genre either

878
01:13:45.52 --> 01:13:51.52
I mean part of it does part of it's kind of this country. There's country elements. There's rock elements. There's some more aggressive more punk stuff. There's

879
01:13:51.52 --> 01:14:04.52
folk stuff. There's ballads. There's you know, it's it belongs in anything. It's organic. Yeah, and it comes from mostly comes from three guys playing or you know, if we put some other stuff on albums

880
01:14:05.52 --> 01:14:07.52
But it's it's

881
01:14:08.52 --> 01:14:10.52
We're the most stripped down band that

882
01:14:12.52 --> 01:14:19.52
You'll ever see really. I mean, other than if it's one guy playing guitar, I mean, it's three guys with no effects. Yeah, there's no vocal effects. There's no effects

883
01:14:19.52 --> 01:14:22.52
I'm like a tar there's no there's no nothing. It's three guys

884
01:14:23.52 --> 01:14:32.52
So that's an issue because you can't say oh, there's this you know, this other band that kind of fits in the white buffalo category and there we can play with these four other bands

885
01:14:33.52 --> 01:14:36.52
We can do a festival or whatever because where do you really fit

886
01:14:37.52 --> 01:14:46.52
At the same time though, but you can fit in all other little categories too. There's benefits to that too because I can play a rock festival. Yeah, I can play a country festival, you know,

887
01:14:46.52 --> 01:14:48.52
You know, yeah, because you're kind of like your own

888
01:14:50.52 --> 01:15:00.52
You know, your own little foot your own little genre. Yeah, I never hopefully that I have my own sound kind of you know, which is not to mention I think you're the only person that writes murder songs

889
01:15:01.52 --> 01:15:03.52
Right, or at least once you could dance.

890
01:15:04.52 --> 01:15:10.52
I'm a singer song. I guess that's right. I've got some leaving out all my death metal brothers out there who are right 100% murder songs

891
01:15:10.52 --> 01:15:12.52
You'll be only one out there doing acoustic folk

892
01:15:12.52 --> 01:15:16.52
Folk murder songs even though have you ever heard

893
01:15:16.52 --> 01:15:25.52
But what is it called Viking folk metal have you ever heard that Viking folk metal? Yes, yes, now they play like traditional Viking instruments

894
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:32.52
But they're playing metal really yes, I mean that's there's another guy people come from like Viking blood

895
01:15:33.52 --> 01:15:35.52
Maybe that's my job

896
01:15:35.52 --> 01:15:43.52
At least you can slide in there you can maybe do some some Viking folk metal what do they call festivals?

897
01:15:44.52 --> 01:15:45.52
I mean if they exist

898
01:15:46.52 --> 01:15:48.52
Probably somewhere in Scandinavia, right?

899
01:15:49.52 --> 01:15:52.52
So when you when you when you're

900
01:15:54.52 --> 01:15:56.52
Do do the where the songs come from

901
01:15:57.52 --> 01:16:02.52
Like that the majority of them if not all of them come from just silence from nowhere

902
01:16:02.52 --> 01:16:10.52
You know a lot of them will be gibberish or something they just come in out of being quiet and they often

903
01:16:12.52 --> 01:16:15.52
I will say something sing something and

904
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:22.52
I will recognize what the important part is or the piece of it that that has some validity or worth

905
01:16:23.52 --> 01:16:25.52
And expand on that

906
01:16:25.52 --> 01:16:30.52
One little idea most of the time some of the time I'll sing something that just I don't even know where I came from you know

907
01:16:30.52 --> 01:16:36.52
It's I can sing a whole verse and of course not not with not with an idea that I'm gonna write a song about this

908
01:16:37.52 --> 01:16:41.52
I don't know what they're about initially and then I craft them into things

909
01:16:42.52 --> 01:16:45.52
That hopefully have some kind of emotional response

910
01:16:46.52 --> 01:16:50.52
So there's some level of you being on the lookout for a little

911
01:16:51.52 --> 01:16:57.52
Nugget of goodness that you can grab onto and I plant and I just feel lucky like I feel like they're lucky

912
01:16:57.52 --> 01:16:59.52
Little diamonds that come out of fucking the ether

913
01:17:00.52 --> 01:17:06.52
You know what I mean and I think my gift is recognizing what those little lucky moments are to go like all of them

914
01:17:07.52 --> 01:17:18.52
Grab that that's a good idea, you know, and I do I I know that I can craft something off a one very small idea to realize how I can turn that into a whole concept or a whole song pretty quick

915
01:17:18.52 --> 01:17:28.52
But yeah, I don't know I wish I had better stories about it. I was talking to Robert O'Kee and did a podcast with him and he was like, what tell me what

916
01:17:29.52 --> 01:17:32.52
Where were you at? What was this you know what seems to be racial behind this? I'm like

917
01:17:33.52 --> 01:17:36.52
There's no inspiration. It's just imagined

918
01:17:37.52 --> 01:17:40.52
You know, it's like imagination is that the inspiration

919
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:44.52
Yeah, but it's not in my head. I'm not like it's not there's no

920
01:17:44.52 --> 01:17:52.52
I'm pretty thought about it rarely. It's born in your head. Yeah, just comes from your head. Yeah, that's like deep

921
01:17:53.52 --> 01:17:58.52
So I was named loose major in college all that you know, so what you're saying right now

922
01:17:59.52 --> 01:18:01.52
What you're saying right now, I'm gonna put you on the spot

923
01:18:02.52 --> 01:18:05.52
What you're saying right now is there was these people and there was all there's all this controversy

924
01:18:06.52 --> 01:18:08.52
I'm not even going to remember that well because I really don't remember that much of college

925
01:18:08.52 --> 01:18:15.52
But there would be people that would say you know, I wrote this poem just it just I just wrote it

926
01:18:16.52 --> 01:18:23.52
And I'm talking like classical like real famous literature people. Oh the word is at this person just wrote this just came out

927
01:18:24.52 --> 01:18:30.52
And it's like they didn't have to work for it. That's kind of what you're doing. You're just like, hey, I'm really over here just for you

928
01:18:31.52 --> 01:18:33.52
Just develop it nuggets of gold

929
01:18:33.52 --> 01:18:41.52
I'm rarely doing that they're really that easy. Okay, inception of them the beginnings of them are that easy

930
01:18:42.52 --> 01:18:48.52
But some of the time it's a very small little piece of something and it's not very rarely sometimes

931
01:18:49.52 --> 01:18:53.52
I had sat down in my in my lifetime and and just something spilled out and then you know, they're only shit there

932
01:18:54.52 --> 01:19:00.52
It is like love song number one is one kind of like that. There was it off my first EP that just kind of spilled out and then I was like, well, this

933
01:19:00.52 --> 01:19:07.52
I was like, well, this like what was on it? What is on about you know, there's even a moment in the song where I'm still like, what is that even about it?

934
01:19:08.52 --> 01:19:10.52
And

935
01:19:11.52 --> 01:19:17.52
And just left it in kind of you know, now I edit more stuff now, you know, and make every word perfect

936
01:19:18.52 --> 01:19:21.52
Our child's perfect. It's like feel like I can make it, you know, but

937
01:19:21.52 --> 01:19:34.52
And then what's the deal on you know, what are you oh, in other words, are you like, hey, I better get another album out and another, you know, because you just you just put out your latest album, what?

938
01:19:35.52 --> 01:19:40.52
If you want to go? Yeah April, April 17th April 17th so now

939
01:19:41.52 --> 01:19:48.52
Do you start feeling the pressure in your head of I need to do more because I need to cut another album. Do you start feeling pressure in your head that you got ideas and then that need to get out?

940
01:19:48.52 --> 01:19:53.52
Do you not even think about it? I don't even think about it. I don't like I I

941
01:19:54.52 --> 01:20:00.52
I'll write here in there and we'll be a little snippets in my phone, but I don't really think about it. Even this last record

942
01:20:01.52 --> 01:20:03.52
Who I did with shooter Jannings produced it

943
01:20:06.52 --> 01:20:12.52
But I didn't have I didn't think I had hardly any songs going into talking with him and meeting with him and

944
01:20:12.52 --> 01:20:19.52
And the night before we went out drinking like the first time and we didn't even talk about working together really just talking about life and

945
01:20:20.52 --> 01:20:27.52
Just get drunk we got drunk right where do we get drunk out where do we get drunk out or where do we get drunk

946
01:20:28.52 --> 01:20:35.52
For all the room on like Hollywood what I mean brandably no no, it was set up it was like a blind date between our

947
01:20:35.52 --> 01:20:42.52
God or set us up thinking that it this might be a match made in heaven, but not when it's I went in the first time to meet him to kind of show

948
01:20:43.52 --> 01:20:49.52
What I've been working on or something you know to develop some songs and I was like, I don't have shit. I feel like I'm shit. I woke up

949
01:20:50.52 --> 01:20:53.52
the night before and

950
01:20:55.52 --> 01:20:57.52
How did an idea saying it into my phone and

951
01:20:58.52 --> 01:21:03.52
Was like okay, well, at least I can show them that tomorrow and then we'll work on that all day

952
01:21:03.52 --> 01:21:05.52
I can see what happens

953
01:21:05.52 --> 01:21:07.52
Well, I picked that to him I sang a term

954
01:21:08.52 --> 01:21:12.52
I think it was kind of the idea it was actually quite realized but it's like my son was like sleeping

955
01:21:12.52 --> 01:21:17.52
I had this little tiny studio fucking place where sleeping and my son sleeping on the

956
01:21:18.52 --> 01:21:22.52
Like I think make out what I'm saying, but I'm trying to be quiet

957
01:21:22.52 --> 01:21:28.52
That's not way can and I show him this thing the next day and then I sing it and we've worked it out in like 20 minutes

958
01:21:28.52 --> 01:21:32.52
And then I already have it kind of realized and he's like well, well, so you have I was like, oh, I have

959
01:21:33.52 --> 01:21:35.52
Oh, this and he's like, well, that's amazing explore that explore that

960
01:21:36.52 --> 01:21:40.52
There were all those you have and I was like, oh, how about this and he's like, that's yeah do that like explore that

961
01:21:41.52 --> 01:21:45.52
And I would just and then we just went down and I was like, okay, and then after that little meeting

962
01:21:45.52 --> 01:21:48.52
I went on just a bit like a I go on little writing

963
01:21:49.52 --> 01:21:54.52
Tears little benders and then I just basically wrote the whole album in about a week

964
01:21:54.52 --> 01:21:59.52
A week and a half and before I was like, you know, I have a little snippets that are coming in

965
01:22:00.52 --> 01:22:07.52
You know, but then to realize and then finish them really fast sometimes sometimes you know, it's like added

966
01:22:08.52 --> 01:22:11.52
Sometimes it's out of just inspiration and desperation

967
01:22:12.52 --> 01:22:18.52
So the little pressure can maybe squeeze something out of you have you ever been in a point where you were feeling pressure

968
01:22:18.52 --> 01:22:21.52
But just nothing was coming out I had another album

969
01:22:21.52 --> 01:22:25.52
Love in the death of damn nation

970
01:22:26.52 --> 01:22:29.52
I remember I used to with the old producers I would go and I would sing I would give and have all these ideas

971
01:22:30.52 --> 01:22:34.52
And I would go in and then we would like, okay, let's explore that one let's do that work on that one

972
01:22:35.52 --> 01:22:39.52
And a lot of time it would be like everyone but I have like 20 ideas, 25 ideas or something like that

973
01:22:40.52 --> 01:22:42.52
And for that album I had like

974
01:22:43.52 --> 01:22:48.52
It was about time to record and I had maybe six ideas that I played in there I'll come on all of them

975
01:22:48.52 --> 01:22:52.52
You know and then I was like fuck it let's just start Wednesday

976
01:22:53.52 --> 01:22:56.52
I'm like what are we gonna do Wednesday? I was like I'll be ready Wednesday

977
01:22:57.52 --> 01:22:58.52
You'd be ready Wednesday

978
01:22:59.52 --> 01:23:03.52
And then we just did that one like that but that was completely out of desperation and then hit a lucky

979
01:23:04.52 --> 01:23:06.52
Perlific time

980
01:23:07.52 --> 01:23:10.52
Little lucky streak here from great album

981
01:23:11.52 --> 01:23:16.52
How did you link up with with Matt and Christopher

982
01:23:16.52 --> 01:23:18.52
So Matt has been drumming

983
01:23:19.52 --> 01:23:21.52
Then he's a freaking animal by the way

984
01:23:22.52 --> 01:23:23.52
He's a freaking animal

985
01:23:24.52 --> 01:23:27.52
I mean as far as I don't think I would be the performer

986
01:23:28.52 --> 01:23:29.52
I am today without Matt

987
01:23:30.52 --> 01:23:33.52
No you guys you guys get you guys look at each other and you guys just get go off

988
01:23:34.52 --> 01:23:39.52
It's freaking savage. It's awesome. I mean especially for like a acoustic trio who do you think wouldn't be terribly aggressive

989
01:23:40.52 --> 01:23:41.52
You know

990
01:23:41.52 --> 01:23:49.52
And he's just sticks a fly and break freaking and shards of wood or you know, getting pulled out of two to two minutes

991
01:23:50.52 --> 01:23:56.52
At some point I realized that you called him the machine right and then I would every shot go to and I'd be like machine

992
01:23:57.52 --> 01:24:03.52
I would get all crazy but and then like the last couple times I've gone other people were yelling and I was kind of disappointed

993
01:24:04.52 --> 01:24:05.52
I kind of felt like all that

994
01:24:05.52 --> 01:24:11.52
I don't know I mean I just can't I was just going to yeah because he just goes nuts so I'm sorry. How did you link up with him?

995
01:24:12.52 --> 01:24:15.52
That was actually the first album I did for the Hurley guy hog tied

996
01:24:16.52 --> 01:24:20.52
Like a rodeo. I've had Matt since then. No way he wasn't on that album

997
01:24:21.52 --> 01:24:26.52
But there was a guy Tommy Andrews who's from San Diego as well who was my base player for the first ten years of my career

998
01:24:27.52 --> 01:24:31.52
Played guitar on that album and new

999
01:24:31.52 --> 01:24:34.52
Matt and this guy Russell Hayden

1000
01:24:35.52 --> 01:24:37.52
We played banjo in Dobro like the most evil

1001
01:24:38.52 --> 01:24:43.52
I can banjo you ever you heard and uh, but it was perfect for his creepy evil banjo

1002
01:24:44.52 --> 01:24:51.52
I mean like where he wouldn't what he would like just like live him and now he in like to know how he brows and he'd be like like like an awesome banjo

1003
01:24:52.52 --> 01:24:59.52
But anyways, but I met Matt through this guy Tommy Andrews and we all did it. It was the first time I ever felt

1004
01:24:59.52 --> 01:25:01.52
But for that I'd only played by myself

1005
01:25:02.52 --> 01:25:06.52
Yeah, really never played never performed even when I'm in the corner of any place was always by myself

1006
01:25:06.52 --> 01:25:13.52
And that was the first time I was like whoa, this is what it feels like to really feel and feed off of other people's energy and playing

1007
01:25:14.52 --> 01:25:15.52
And

1008
01:25:15.52 --> 01:25:21.52
Matt's played with me ever since and Christopher has spent with us for maybe Matt and Christopher are like best buddies

1009
01:25:22.52 --> 01:25:23.52
And

1010
01:25:23.52 --> 01:25:29.52
Huffie's not even a wasn't even a bass player. He's a producer and engineer, so he played everything, right?

1011
01:25:30.52 --> 01:25:35.52
It's one of those guys. Yeah, not he's a really good bass player now. Yeah, um, what's when

1012
01:25:37.52 --> 01:25:45.52
Look, I try and explain this to people you got it get the albums for sure and then you got to go see you got to go see the live shows it's freaking insane

1013
01:25:45.52 --> 01:25:55.52
I think yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean, we're just go fucking go a shit. I mean, we don't know and I just think it's very visceral and the way that we approach

1014
01:25:56.52 --> 01:26:03.52
Like it's like the last show of our lives, you know, we do that every night and I don't know any other way to do it, you know, and Matt doesn't

1015
01:26:03.52 --> 01:26:08.52
Christopher, we're just like, you know, a few wild animals up there.

1016
01:26:08.52 --> 01:26:19.52
You know, is it, do you feel it? Do you feel frustration that you, I mean, are you getting it? Do you, you don't have a live album?

1017
01:26:20.52 --> 01:26:25.52
No, we don't. Are you gonna do that? Do you think it would get it done? Do you think it'd be able to capture it?

1018
01:26:26.52 --> 01:26:35.52
I think so. I think we could. I mean, the hardest part is really acoustic guitar live is a difficult thing to kind of capture that make that sound like an acoustic guitar

1019
01:26:35.52 --> 01:26:42.52
But yeah, I think we could capture it live. We people ask that all the time because it is such a different animal. I mean, I think

1020
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:48.52
I mean, it's a high compliment when people are like, oh, it's better than the albums, you know, it's it's

1021
01:26:49.52 --> 01:26:54.52
I think it's more of an experience. I mean, to get people during parts of the show that

1022
01:26:55.52 --> 01:27:03.52
You know, the people want to fight during this time people are crying, you know, and you'll see right you see like a military guy in a

1023
01:27:03.52 --> 01:27:08.52
Fucking hippie in there and you know, and some guy from some other completely different background

1024
01:27:09.52 --> 01:27:16.52
But somehow they found this secret band, you know, it's like, this is our band. This is our band

1025
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:19.52
But oh, it's okay. It's man, too, but that's okay. We're in this together.

1026
01:27:20.52 --> 01:27:27.52
Bikers hippies surfers. I mean, it's like, let's all, let's all go get some, right? That's freaking, yeah, it's

1027
01:27:27.52 --> 01:27:33.52
It's awesome. If people get a chance to see that it's like, you got to go check it out.

1028
01:27:36.52 --> 01:27:40.52
Dude, what's the madador about the madador?

1029
01:27:41.52 --> 01:27:44.52
Yeah, madador was, that was actually the first song that he used on sons of anarchy

1030
01:27:45.52 --> 01:27:48.52
That, but it was off of my first EP. It was already recorded.

1031
01:27:49.52 --> 01:27:54.52
Madador, I wanted to do a song that you couldn't tell if it was a man

1032
01:27:54.52 --> 01:27:59.52
killing people or a man killing or madador

1033
01:28:00.52 --> 01:28:04.52
And I just like that kind of loose

1034
01:28:09.52 --> 01:28:12.52
A thing where you can't tell really

1035
01:28:13.52 --> 01:28:18.52
And I want to leave it up to the listener where they decide is this a man killing people in the light of day

1036
01:28:18.52 --> 01:28:23.52
In public and put on a people or is this the, or is he talking about a bullfighter?

1037
01:28:24.52 --> 01:28:28.52
Yeah, you know, that's kind of a wild concept. Kind of, and I don't know where that right?

1038
01:28:29.52 --> 01:28:32.52
How about carnage? Carnage is another dark one.

1039
01:28:33.52 --> 01:28:35.52
That one, my idea was

1040
01:28:37.52 --> 01:28:44.52
Some kind of warfare comes to where you live, some kind of either, either it's a new killer viral or something

1041
01:28:44.52 --> 01:28:47.52
And you have to take your family and go hide down on the basement

1042
01:28:48.52 --> 01:28:52.52
And it's kind of a narrative so it starts and we all just go hide down on the basement

1043
01:28:53.52 --> 01:28:57.52
And I feel like the main character is kind of the father figure

1044
01:28:58.52 --> 01:29:01.52
And then you don't know what's happening outside

1045
01:29:02.52 --> 01:29:05.52
Everyone was just hiding and it just gets darker and darker

1046
01:29:06.52 --> 01:29:08.52
And people start kind of losing their minds

1047
01:29:08.52 --> 01:29:12.52
The madman

1048
01:29:13.52 --> 01:29:14.52
Madman just

1049
01:29:15.52 --> 01:29:16.52
You're going to all murder songs

1050
01:29:17.52 --> 01:29:19.52
I just thought to myself I'm like well, that's all murder songs

1051
01:29:20.52 --> 01:29:24.52
And like you said earlier, you've got the sweetest songs, you've got the most romantic songs

1052
01:29:25.52 --> 01:29:31.52
And you've definitely provided some very nice evenings for me and my wife to hang out and have a very pleasant time

1053
01:29:32.52 --> 01:29:36.52
You've also provided me with nice soundtracks for the darkness

1054
01:29:36.52 --> 01:29:41.52
Yeah, I mean I love that I mean the thing is I don't know why people don't dive into the fucking dark side of the pool

1055
01:29:42.52 --> 01:29:44.52
You know it's like there's so much jacco podcast

1056
01:29:45.52 --> 01:29:50.52
But there's so much you know in those shadowy parts like movies like that and stuff like that

1057
01:29:51.52 --> 01:29:56.52
That's a powerful primal thing that I think is cool that that should be explored

1058
01:29:57.52 --> 01:30:01.52
I think I'm lucky that I can sing in the way I can that I can be tender at some moments when I

1059
01:30:01.52 --> 01:30:06.52
I love song or I have something that needs to be and then on the other side of the hand

1060
01:30:07.52 --> 01:30:09.52
To be more aggressive and loud and howling

1061
01:30:10.52 --> 01:30:15.52
But the other madman's another just serial killer kind of murder song

1062
01:30:16.52 --> 01:30:21.52
It's just like you can't he's undeniably so you just all powerful and he's coming after you

1063
01:30:22.52 --> 01:30:23.52
It's just scary

1064
01:30:23.52 --> 01:30:31.52
You know I never I never have thought about the fact that you write murder songs before

1065
01:30:32.52 --> 01:30:36.52
Didn't till you said it today. I was like, oh, yeah, that's that's the whole thing. There's a bunch of those murder songs

1066
01:30:37.52 --> 01:30:45.52
Every album at least as at least one. Yeah, I mean I'm looking at my listen like, oh, yeah, yeah, that's that's oh yeah, oh, Darwin. What have I done? Oh, yeah, that's that's absolute free

1067
01:30:46.52 --> 01:30:51.52
That one's fucking twisted though. That one's that one's about a man who thinks

1068
01:30:51.52 --> 01:31:02.52
I don't know I come up with this bullshit, but like now how who thinks in order to get the affection of his woman and that he starts killing people and collecting

1069
01:31:03.52 --> 01:31:14.52
Basically collecting these lives and these killing these people as like a sign of like the ultimate gift to give to this woman kind of in his mind thinking that she's going he's going to win his her affection due to

1070
01:31:15.52 --> 01:31:18.52
Whatever the solution

1071
01:31:18.52 --> 01:31:21.52
How about the pilot

1072
01:31:22.52 --> 01:31:25.52
The pilot feels like I love this song

1073
01:31:26.52 --> 01:31:36.52
The high women by Jimmy Webb. Yeah, and it wasn't it wasn't off that something, but it's it's that one's just kind of just about kicking ass kind of like

1074
01:31:37.52 --> 01:31:39.52
Checking ass and taking names

1075
01:31:39.52 --> 01:31:49.52
That part yeah, that's part of the pilot. I mean that one I like how it starts you know you start with the pilot and basically it's kind of just sets of sets of table for just a pilot and then it goes

1076
01:31:50.52 --> 01:31:52.52
Fire pilot and it goes outlaw and then it's just like

1077
01:31:53.52 --> 01:31:56.52
What is it to one? Yeah kicking ass taking a go down to town killing dreams. Yes

1078
01:31:56.52 --> 01:32:11.52
Yes, man, you know you did the album with the Joey White theme throughout it and that's so that's that's like a what is it a rock opera? What is it is it a concept out? My guess is what we call it

1079
01:32:12.52 --> 01:32:14.52
We've got this whole story this whole thread of

1080
01:32:14.52 --> 01:32:26.52
Of a couple yeah, right and you know, it sounds like they meet when they're young. You got some freaking great lines man just great great stuff

1081
01:32:27.52 --> 01:32:38.52
What what made you decide to go I am going concept album. I've always wanted to. I mean I always look at my songs as little movies little mini movies and the idea of building a whole narrative

1082
01:32:38.52 --> 01:32:52.52
Around those linking those also it's a linear thing which I don't even know most concepts albums are seen really loose like even if you listen to darks out of moon or something that's not like you jump from one thing to another

1083
01:32:53.52 --> 01:32:56.52
You know and that's this guy's whole road

1084
01:32:56.52 --> 01:33:12.52
I did I don't know I've always been fascinated by war and soldiers and people going off the war and then coming back and all this thing and it's so I had some songs already and I was like I want to do a concept album and then I said

1085
01:33:12.52 --> 01:33:26.52
Oh, and I do it now and I thought oh I could put this song here or this kind of start changing names put this song over here and then build this whole arc of this guy's lifetime. You know it's basically a love story, I think of the love story, but it's

1086
01:33:26.52 --> 01:33:52.52
You know, it's a white buffalo kind of way right in a murder. It's sort of a dark a dark thing so they start off. They meet each other. They fall in love, but it's kind of this forbidden love and so they have to go leave the small town there from and he finds out pretty quickly that he cannot provide first family. So he joins the military goes off to war kills feels like kind of a killing machine and then comes back

1087
01:33:52.52 --> 01:34:07.52
still kind of blood thirsting and not assimilating kills again at home and then it's got excuse back into a love story kind of release this his road to redemption kind of

1088
01:34:07.52 --> 01:34:25.52
And the one thing is the power of love with the power of his woman is what makes him feel human or halfway human again and it basically goes the whole arc to his life at the end he's he's going to die and he's kind of questioning God and wondering

1089
01:34:25.52 --> 01:34:37.52
If they're all this bad shit, I've done it in my life like my in there are you go up there you know just still kind of confusing and conflicted but trying to figure out

1090
01:34:37.52 --> 01:34:53.52
Man freaking all all just great stuff man. I wherever you're getting it from I hope those little magic nuggets that go into your brain help or enter your brain or are produced in your brain. I hope they just freaking keep on coming man

1091
01:34:53.52 --> 01:35:12.52
Hey did your son play lead guitar for you one time at house of blues. I did many times. Okay, I mean I'm not my oldest son Tanner who is we've tried to add a fourth guy sometimes, you know, we've always liked this power trio kind of thing or the acoustic guitars ridiculous really but

1092
01:35:12.52 --> 01:35:28.52
But we would try to add a fourth guy, but it always felt like it kind of took away from I mean all we were kind of dynamics, you know, so we get really big and we're really quiet we get really big and with three that seems to work really well and you add another thing but Tanner is

1093
01:35:28.52 --> 01:35:42.52
When he's at his on his game and at his best has been maybe my favorite fourth kind of verb during it. He's an animal right on what so what's up next? What's the future hold?

1094
01:35:42.52 --> 01:35:56.52
That's a weird time. I mean, you know, it's like I had an album come out during this you know, COVID and the pandemic and and touring stopped we had I mean a shit let us shows you know shows going

1095
01:35:56.52 --> 01:36:11.52
All of 2020 and beyond, you know, we were going to go all the way around the world all over the world, you know, at least places that we'd have some history and it's just that's just I'll stop that I'll dried up and so there's nothing

1096
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:27.52
That's all being postponed to hopefully when we do it, I mean our first tour that we were going to do in April that's going to be a whole year. We're going to go back to Europe in April and then hopefully stuff will start opening up and I don't know really the future is is

1097
01:36:27.52 --> 01:36:39.52
Unknown the year to stay at least, but yeah, I mean I'm going to continue I was really proud of this this you know recent piece of work that I did, which almost was going to start out as a concept as well.

1098
01:36:39.52 --> 01:36:59.52
What was the concept going to be this one was one time we were touring traveling around the eastern seaboard and I keep seeing these these rooftop decks up on top of these kind of Victorian houses and I'm like what are those you know and and the drummer was like oh those are called widows walks and those are the wives

1099
01:36:59.52 --> 01:37:27.52
We're significant others of captains and what are efficient in wailers or stuff we you know they would their husbands would leave and go do their jobs but not return for many months or many weeks and the wives would go up kind of scouting looking longing for their husbands to come home and I just thought like oh that's a very you got it it's all right there right I mean you have the romance you have the drama you have the

1100
01:37:27.52 --> 01:37:31.52
The see the power you know and

1101
01:37:32.52 --> 01:37:40.52
Just the story was already there I was like us going to be easy and I started writing some of those which is a song called widows walk

1102
01:37:40.52 --> 01:37:47.52
There's one the one the sick and more that made the album there's a couple that are still on there but then I had these other songs I was like because confining

1103
01:37:47.52 --> 01:37:59.52
You know if you're like especially when I think of a concept album as a narrative to be like oh whether this song about the fires and California in 2018 or there this song about that wouldn't really fit in the construct of that

1104
01:38:02.52 --> 01:38:05.52
So I kind of abandon the idea without

1105
01:38:05.52 --> 01:38:12.52
Not entirely kind of some of the songs made it and then inadvertently other songs would have other

1106
01:38:12.52 --> 01:38:16.52
Angles angles and concepts and water and

1107
01:38:18.52 --> 01:38:26.52
Longing and lost loves and all kinds of stuff that ended up kind of getting into there and being part of the writing but way blu sir

1108
01:38:27.52 --> 01:38:28.52
You know

1109
01:38:28.52 --> 01:38:39.52
Well to freaking it's another another great album and I always talk about there's there's not too many bands in my opinion that can do five awesome albums in a row

1110
01:38:39.52 --> 01:38:45.52
Like black Sabbath they did it Zeppelin they did it

1111
01:38:46.52 --> 01:38:52.52
Metallica close but they did it right there's not too many bands that can do five awesome albums in row and part of it

1112
01:38:52.52 --> 01:39:02.52
I think what you said earlier, you know you were at this level where you know if if you would have done that first demo and got picked up by whatever big record company

1113
01:39:02.52 --> 01:39:05.52
And had a big bus and all this nice stuff and

1114
01:39:05.52 --> 01:39:12.52
You probably didn't we probably wouldn't even squeeze out even two more good albums, but man you were there and and you're knocking out every album that you

1115
01:39:12.52 --> 01:39:18.52
I don't know what number you're on right now, but it's it's more than five and you're still freaking putting out awesome work

1116
01:39:18.52 --> 01:39:22.52
And I don't know what the future holds, but I do know this when you're back on the road

1117
01:39:22.52 --> 01:39:30.52
We will be there. Well, thank you kindly you got you any last thoughts man. No, I just appreciate you. I appreciate you. You know

1118
01:39:30.52 --> 01:39:39.52
I appreciate that I'm a part of so many people's lives, you know often the than terrible parts of their lives that that I get people coming up to me

1119
01:39:40.52 --> 01:39:48.52
Saying how I help them through this moment at the force or or being in the military or death of somebody super close to them

1120
01:39:50.52 --> 01:39:57.52
And I'm proud to be that, you know, for a while it's odd because I'm actually not that serious of a dude

1121
01:39:57.52 --> 01:40:03.52
You know, I'm pretty like if you went drinking with me like that guy really you know

1122
01:40:04.52 --> 01:40:12.52
But there's like a jackland hide thing right kind of is I've been my do these silly episodes these things called in the garage

1123
01:40:13.52 --> 01:40:19.52
Yeah, so I do it's just me and my garage and I'd make some stupid entrance where I'm spitting and twirling or something and then

1124
01:40:19.52 --> 01:40:26.52
I kind of bullshit for two three five minutes about nothing. I'm just kind of rambling and then

1125
01:40:27.52 --> 01:40:32.52
But it's kind of comedic and then then I just go into something probably dark and heavy some song

1126
01:40:32.52 --> 01:40:40.52
But I have this in my catalog and I'll play a song and then that's it, but it is kind of a duality of my persona or my not my persona just who I am

1127
01:40:40.52 --> 01:40:50.52
But there's but it's just like everything I suppose there's you know laughter and there's love and there's you know different sides of the coin and there's the light in the dark and so

1128
01:40:51.52 --> 01:40:55.52
I have that explorer that makes part of that in music as well

1129
01:40:56.52 --> 01:41:00.52
Well, thanks for taking us on the road with you down that down that path

1130
01:41:01.52 --> 01:41:05.52
Like I said look, I know I'm coming out dark because that's sort of that sort of where I tend to go

1131
01:41:06.52 --> 01:41:08.52
But man there's you know a bunch of beautiful songs on there

1132
01:41:08.52 --> 01:41:11.52
The best music for

1133
01:41:12.52 --> 01:41:15.52
You can apply it to just about every part of your life

1134
01:41:16.52 --> 01:41:22.52
So thanks for coming on man, pretty good awesome. Thank you for having me. You think maybe take it out with one mojama

1135
01:41:23.52 --> 01:41:28.52
Shit, you got it something off the new album. Yeah, this is something about this one's called the history

1136
01:41:28.52 --> 01:41:35.52
Get some

1137
01:41:58.52 --> 01:42:00.52
Well

1138
01:42:28.52 --> 01:42:30.52
That's a time

1139
01:42:30.52 --> 01:42:33.52
Probably

1140
01:42:33.52 --> 01:42:37.52
So here and I, I'm nothing more

1141
01:42:37.52 --> 01:42:39.52
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1142
01:42:39.52 --> 01:42:43.52
Something we'll let up be for him

1143
01:42:43.52 --> 01:43:05.52
No history, no history

1144
01:43:05.52 --> 01:43:09.52
Memories they're congratulating

1145
01:43:09.52 --> 01:43:15.52
When the passes are waste to you alive, you can't rewind

1146
01:43:15.52 --> 01:43:21.52
Leave it all behind, what if more than never comes?

1147
01:43:21.52 --> 01:43:27.52
Build your tomorrow rules out of tape, they're all gonna go

1148
01:43:27.52 --> 01:43:35.52
When nobody knows, but I feel in the future

1149
01:43:35.52 --> 01:43:45.52
It becomes, they're the ones we love for every time

1150
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:51.52
You can't hold a hands of time

1151
01:43:51.52 --> 01:43:55.52
So here and I, I'm nothing more

1152
01:43:55.52 --> 01:43:57.52
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1153
01:43:57.52 --> 01:44:01.52
Something we'll let up be for him

1154
01:44:01.52 --> 01:44:07.52
No history, no history

1155
01:44:07.52 --> 01:44:13.52
Well you can't hold a hands of time

1156
01:44:13.52 --> 01:44:21.52
So here and I, I'm nothing more

1157
01:44:21.52 --> 01:44:23.52
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1158
01:44:23.52 --> 01:44:27.52
Something we'll let up be for him

1159
01:44:27.52 --> 01:44:33.52
No history, no history

1160
01:44:33.52 --> 01:44:39.52
No history, no history

1161
01:44:39.52 --> 01:44:47.52
No history, no history

1162
01:44:51.52 --> 01:44:53.52
Boom

1163
01:44:53.52 --> 01:44:55.52
Awesome man, thanks for coming down brother

1164
01:44:55.52 --> 01:44:57.52
My pleasure, thank you for having me

1165
01:44:57.52 --> 01:45:03.52
And with that, Jake, the white buffalo Smith has left the building

1166
01:45:03.52 --> 01:45:07.52
By the way, I forgot to mention this, you can find him on the interwebs

1167
01:45:07.52 --> 01:45:11.52
At the white buffalo dot com on Facebook, at the white buffalo

1168
01:45:11.52 --> 01:45:15.52
Instagram, buffalo

1169
01:45:15.52 --> 01:45:19.52
Buffalo, I'm sure, maybe crazy buffalo

1170
01:45:19.52 --> 01:45:21.52
Is it, I think you're

1171
01:45:21.52 --> 01:45:25.52
B-U-F-F-A-L-O-C-O buffalo

1172
01:45:25.52 --> 01:45:27.52
Yes

1173
01:45:27.52 --> 01:45:31.52
Twitter, Blanco buffalo

1174
01:45:31.52 --> 01:45:37.52
Right, so and then YouTube, there's also YouTube channel, the white buffalo he puts out this little video to just talk about

1175
01:45:39.52 --> 01:45:43.52
That's that man, I'll also have him down

1176
01:45:43.52 --> 01:45:45.52
Jake, thanks for coming down

1177
01:45:45.52 --> 01:45:47.52
And echo

1178
01:45:47.52 --> 01:45:49.52
There is some darkness

1179
01:45:49.52 --> 01:45:51.52
Yeah

1180
01:45:51.52 --> 01:45:53.52
And some light in the world

1181
01:45:53.52 --> 01:45:55.52
It is true

1182
01:45:55.52 --> 01:45:59.52
I think it was interesting to come and bring you know for those of us that didn't go deep

1183
01:45:59.52 --> 01:46:01.52
Because you mentioned white buffalo

1184
01:46:01.52 --> 01:46:03.52
A lot

1185
01:46:03.52 --> 01:46:05.52
The buffalo, Blanco

1186
01:46:05.52 --> 01:46:07.52
You mentioned them

1187
01:46:07.52 --> 01:46:09.52
From time to time

1188
01:46:09.52 --> 01:46:13.52
So those of us that didn't go deep into, you know, restart the exploring like who this was that you'd mentioned from time to time

1189
01:46:13.52 --> 01:46:17.52
It was good to kind of bring them to light

1190
01:46:17.52 --> 01:46:18.52
I understand now

1191
01:46:18.52 --> 01:46:20.52
Yeah

1192
01:46:20.52 --> 01:46:22.52
I recognize

1193
01:46:22.52 --> 01:46:24.52
Yeah

1194
01:46:24.52 --> 01:46:26.52
At what point did you go down

1195
01:46:26.52 --> 01:46:28.52
Before we started recording and he was sort of

1196
01:46:28.52 --> 01:46:30.52
Sorting out as low as the house

1197
01:46:30.52 --> 01:46:32.52
Yeah, it was like okay

1198
01:46:32.52 --> 01:46:34.52
Actually when he rolled in and you know when someone starts talking

1199
01:46:34.52 --> 01:46:36.52
Especially big guy like him

1200
01:46:36.52 --> 01:46:38.52
I think they start talking

1201
01:46:38.52 --> 01:46:40.52
Oh, you have a singing voice right now

1202
01:46:40.52 --> 01:46:40.52
Maybe I tell this

1203
01:46:40.52 --> 01:46:42.52
You know why though I think

1204
01:46:42.52 --> 01:46:44.52
Because you know like I used to do when I used to make

1205
01:46:44.52 --> 01:46:46.52
Like more

1206
01:46:46.52 --> 01:46:48.52
Like don't show me say like narrative type videos

1207
01:46:48.52 --> 01:46:50.52
And I I would hire a lot of voice over people

1208
01:46:50.52 --> 01:46:52.52
Yeah

1209
01:46:52.52 --> 01:46:54.52
And I did some voice over

1210
01:46:54.52 --> 01:46:56.52
I'm gonna do it for actually Charles

1211
01:46:56.52 --> 01:46:58.52
Yes

1212
01:46:58.52 --> 01:47:00.52
So a lot of these professional voice over people

1213
01:47:00.52 --> 01:47:06.52
Like you listen to their demo or some some of the guys like I'd call up on the phone

1214
01:47:06.52 --> 01:47:08.52
And when they answer the phone I'm like

1215
01:47:08.52 --> 01:47:10.52
I see

1216
01:47:10.52 --> 01:47:14.52
What you're working with there already just them talking

1217
01:47:14.52 --> 01:47:18.52
One guy one guy was like he put on you could tell he put it on to answer them

1218
01:47:18.52 --> 01:47:24.52
Is that can allow you like yeah I'm looking for Mike Jacobs the voice actor

1219
01:47:24.52 --> 01:47:26.52
And he's like one second please hello

1220
01:47:26.52 --> 01:47:34.52
Yeah, actually that's essentially what happened except he just oh without the gate

1221
01:47:34.52 --> 01:47:38.52
He was he was performing he was a auditioning straight out on his own

1222
01:47:38.52 --> 01:47:42.52
But thing is I emailed him so he knew I was gonna call so of course

1223
01:47:42.52 --> 01:47:47.80
But nonetheless when her Jake talk out it's like oh I did hit me like okay

1224
01:47:47.80 --> 01:47:53.96
I see you and then some pipes yes or yeah, and then that's why I was gonna ask him like so he

1225
01:47:53.96 --> 01:47:56.76
You didn't take any voice lessons or anything but you just got the

1226
01:47:57.64 --> 01:48:00.28
Got the talent yeah, how did it get just good

1227
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Oh, yeah, so

1228
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:09.88
Yes, so is that that point I think is when it started to hit me and then yeah the first song was really really good

1229
01:48:09.88 --> 01:48:15.88
And then the second song was really really good that's that's just the absolute tip of the iceberg man

1230
01:48:15.88 --> 01:48:17.88
They're gold all throughout those albums man

1231
01:48:18.92 --> 01:48:20.92
Yeah legit I'm looking to it

1232
01:48:21.32 --> 01:48:26.20
Well, there's darkness in the world as we heard yes, it's true also some light yes

1233
01:48:27.40 --> 01:48:32.60
We talk about the darkness, but we want to move towards the light what he got how can we move towards the light is always

1234
01:48:33.32 --> 01:48:36.68
Be moving towards the light you got embraced the darkness everyone's in a while

1235
01:48:36.68 --> 01:48:41.72
But at the end of the day you don't want to just hang out in darkness all the time that's why we're writing songs called carnage

1236
01:48:45.08 --> 01:48:47.08
Check and so

1237
01:48:47.08 --> 01:48:49.08
We're doing keeping ourselves capable

1238
01:48:49.08 --> 01:48:51.08
As opposed to incapable

1239
01:48:51.80 --> 01:48:53.80
We are keeping ourselves healthy

1240
01:48:53.96 --> 01:48:55.96
Which allows us to be capable

1241
01:48:56.76 --> 01:49:02.60
Which allows us to get out of the darkness if need be so this is what we're doing we're working out we're reading

1242
01:49:02.60 --> 01:49:07.32
You're you a lot I read way more than I did before

1243
01:49:07.64 --> 01:49:13.80
Who's that just talk to somebody I think it's Darip Cooper about like right it grow up just oh

1244
01:49:13.80 --> 01:49:19.16
There's a book let me start reading books, yeah, but now I'm sort of like that like all that

1245
01:49:19.16 --> 01:49:21.96
Let's say yeah, well, he said we're to grow up and you said quiet he said I wouldn't have ready

1246
01:49:21.96 --> 01:49:25.72
If I'd like a quiet more stuff to do which that was a good point

1247
01:49:25.72 --> 01:49:30.76
Sure, not that San Diego sucks though. I think I'm just more mature and understand the value more

1248
01:49:30.76 --> 01:49:33.88
You know how like when you read a lot of times it's like I'm reading you know

1249
01:49:34.60 --> 01:49:37.72
I guess that's first as far as reading goes anyway

1250
01:49:37.88 --> 01:49:42.76
We're doing a lot of stuff to keep ourselves capable of look through okay, let's go back to working out through workouts

1251
01:49:43.24 --> 01:49:48.20
Our bodies take a beating it's the nature of working out really true you work out take a beating true

1252
01:49:48.28 --> 01:49:50.92
Then you recover from that beating those are called gains and

1253
01:49:51.56 --> 01:49:58.92
We want to perpetuate gains, but you got to perpetuate beatings as well so the beatings are the darkness the gains are the light

1254
01:49:58.92 --> 01:50:00.20
Exactly

1255
01:50:00.20 --> 01:50:02.20
Exactly, exactly right

1256
01:50:02.20 --> 01:50:05.08
Anyway, so your joints will take a beating so no worries

1257
01:50:06.20 --> 01:50:11.64
We got some good supplementation for those joints. I have for other stuff so jockel fuel this they line

1258
01:50:12.52 --> 01:50:14.84
high quality tip top top tier

1259
01:50:16.60 --> 01:50:18.60
quality

1260
01:50:18.60 --> 01:50:20.60
supplementation. Okay

1261
01:50:20.60 --> 01:50:22.60
joint warfare

1262
01:50:22.20 --> 01:50:23.80
joints

1263
01:50:23.80 --> 01:50:30.04
Keep your joints in the game 100% super krill oil same deal some antioxidants in their

1264
01:50:30.04 --> 01:50:33.48
two super healthy first healthy situation the grill oil

1265
01:50:34.12 --> 01:50:38.84
Vitamin D and I'm going down the line not in particular or I'm going down the line in the order that I take

1266
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:43.72
I'm straight up every single morning by the way back on the discipline um discipline routine

1267
01:50:44.84 --> 01:50:48.52
Thanks for the suggestion to you. I'll let's okay vitamin D

1268
01:50:49.24 --> 01:50:53.40
immunity keep the immunity up also cold war for immunity

1269
01:50:54.44 --> 01:50:59.64
These are critical in staying in the game and if you don't believe me try not take them

1270
01:50:59.64 --> 01:51:01.64
I don't try not take them but I'm just saying

1271
01:51:02.60 --> 01:51:07.88
Theoretic if you want to test tacos theories you know go ahead and try it you don't recommend it

1272
01:51:07.88 --> 01:51:12.84
Yeah, especially if you took them for a long time then stop taking them that's when you get you see you know

1273
01:51:13.24 --> 01:51:17.08
It's kind of like it's kind of like you stop drinking if you've been drinking for a long time

1274
01:51:17.08 --> 01:51:20.92
You stop drinking how like how much energy you have the next day. It's kind of like that

1275
01:51:21.64 --> 01:51:25.56
I mean you know in a manner speak anyway, you know, I'm talking about also

1276
01:51:25.56 --> 01:51:30.12
Discipline the supplement okay. It's like a whole thing

1277
01:51:30.60 --> 01:51:35.08
It is a multiple choices. Yes multiple choice wait what is

1278
01:51:35.96 --> 01:51:37.80
Discipline yes could you gonna have discipline

1279
01:51:39.16 --> 01:51:43.40
Pills capsules you're gonna have discipline powder and you can have discipline in the cans

1280
01:51:43.80 --> 01:51:46.44
Yes the whole line of discipline is true and

1281
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:52.60
It's sorted itself out and it makes sense to be like okay, so discipline powder take pretty much every day pretty much

1282
01:51:52.60 --> 01:51:54.60
Mm-hmm

1283
01:51:54.60 --> 01:52:01.64
Think before workout that's mainly the thing but if I don't work out that day just take it in the morning boom kind of get off to a good sort of start you know

1284
01:52:02.76 --> 01:52:06.28
The can I use it as essentially an energy drink

1285
01:52:07.72 --> 01:52:12.04
Except for you you don't feel like junk. Yeah, and it's like more refreshing than an energy drink

1286
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:16.68
So it's kind of like this like a I don't know a refreshing energy drink

1287
01:52:17.32 --> 01:52:18.12
Okay

1288
01:52:18.12 --> 01:52:24.28
Multiple flavors by the way um and then the pills that's sort of like on the go I only took the pills one time

1289
01:52:24.52 --> 01:52:29.40
It's really yeah, doesn't take in the pills many times yeah, it hasn't rolled into my routine as

1290
01:52:30.04 --> 01:52:34.20
seamlessly as maybe in your situation nice to get that little hitter

1291
01:52:34.76 --> 01:52:40.04
Truth to get that little hitter boy. I don't imagine so yes, but

1292
01:52:40.52 --> 01:52:44.84
Jocco IT we got that as well. We also got mocks. So look you need supplementation

1293
01:52:44.84 --> 01:52:51.32
We talked about we talk about the gains being the light well you need something to build the light with

1294
01:52:52.68 --> 01:52:55.48
From a physics point of view

1295
01:52:55.88 --> 01:52:59.48
When you want to make gains you need protein

1296
01:52:59.88 --> 01:53:02.12
You might as well protein that tastes like a dessert

1297
01:53:03.64 --> 01:53:08.76
Get yourself some milk. Yeah, it's true. So my son is for he'll be for this month

1298
01:53:08.76 --> 01:53:15.88
Goes into the closet. This was not yesterday before day before yesterday goes into the closet gets uh the peanut butter

1299
01:53:16.12 --> 01:53:18.12
Moch not the kid the warrior kid one

1300
01:53:18.52 --> 01:53:22.12
He says can we make some milkshakes straight up

1301
01:53:22.84 --> 01:53:27.88
Isn't it awesome that your son wants something as much as you want him to have it?

1302
01:53:27.88 --> 01:53:33.16
Yes, here go it like how often you get to your city your kid? Yes, they're begging you to do something

1303
01:53:33.16 --> 01:53:38.12
That's gonna make them healthier stronger and a better person. Yeah, exactly right go have some milk

1304
01:53:38.12 --> 01:53:41.32
I'll make I'll make all the moch you want how's that sound? Yeah

1305
01:53:41.88 --> 01:53:46.68
It's like them asking you hey can I go tell you some push-ups like do you mind if I do that?

1306
01:53:46.68 --> 01:53:51.88
Do you mind if I go outside and do a bunch of eight cow and body builders? Do you get some and you're like absolutely?

1307
01:53:52.20 --> 01:53:55.56
What can I have some milk? Yes, you can it's the same feel makes it up for you

1308
01:53:55.96 --> 01:53:59.96
Let me throw it in the blender throw it in the shaker and just make one up for you

1309
01:54:00.68 --> 01:54:03.56
Exactly right it's like okay, you know how we play you know

1310
01:54:03.56 --> 01:54:09.64
Well where we want to be playing we we want to be playing the lung game right just to cheat strategic over tactical

1311
01:54:10.68 --> 01:54:15.64
So everyone's in a while and I've said this before it's true and once in a while you get one of those

1312
01:54:16.92 --> 01:54:20.76
Golden diamond nuggets. Mm-hmm that is

1313
01:54:22.20 --> 01:54:24.20
beneficial

1314
01:54:24.36 --> 01:54:26.36
Short-term and long-term

1315
01:54:26.36 --> 01:54:33.40
They're rare. They're not every day. They're not every day at every corner. They're not they're rare, but they're there and milk is one of them straight up one of them

1316
01:54:34.52 --> 01:54:37.000
Salmon sushi me as another one. That's my opinion

1317
01:54:37.40 --> 01:54:41.24
So why did we say chocolate you mentioned it sure certified organic

1318
01:54:41.88 --> 01:54:48.68
Refreshing chocolate tea in the tea bags and in cans too. By the way my wife is on those on that kick still

1319
01:54:49.24 --> 01:54:54.28
You get this stuff at origin domain.com or you can get it the vitamin shop around the corner

1320
01:54:54.28 --> 01:54:57.80
Yes, the vitamin shop around the corner. You have to wait

1321
01:54:59.24 --> 01:55:00.36
Go get some

1322
01:55:00.36 --> 01:55:03.000
Screw speaking of origin main.com other stuff on there

1323
01:55:03.72 --> 01:55:06.36
Notably jeans American made denim

01:55:28.44 --> 01:55:33.96
Scraped it's gonna get cold and you're gonna be naked. Yeah, which is not good. That's a many cases

1329
01:55:34.84 --> 01:55:39.24
So get some clothes get some American made clothes get some American made clothes

1330
01:55:40.12 --> 01:55:42.12
That are functional

1331
01:55:42.76 --> 01:55:45.72
And that's where my judgment stops you have to judge the other part

1332
01:55:45.72 --> 01:55:47.72
You

1333
01:55:47.96 --> 01:55:51.08
Speaking of clothes and representing and wearing things

1334
01:55:51.72 --> 01:55:55.32

1363
01:57:52.44 --> 01:57:57.40
Threads that were removed now. We have the unraveling we have some new unravelings coming

1364
01:57:58.60 --> 01:58:00.60

1366
01:58:08.76 --> 01:58:14.76
Haven't done one of those we owe you but you know there's a lot of lessons you need to hear multiple times kids

1367
01:58:15.96 --> 01:58:23.08
So jump on them we also have a YouTube channel where echo takes and he he enhances some videos

1368
01:58:24.12 --> 01:58:28.12
Especially if it's a video that's very short and you could easily pay attention to

1369
01:58:28.12 --> 01:58:31.96
Then he puts a bunch of enhancement in there to make sure you can watch it for two minutes in 30 seconds

1370
01:58:31.96 --> 01:58:37.32
But when he does a three-hour video you doesn't put any enhancements in there. It's just a plain

1371
01:58:38.20 --> 01:58:42.20
Black and white video of two heads or three heads people talking

1372
01:58:42.68 --> 01:58:46.44
And for some reason that's the way echoes organized it which is his call. You know

1373
01:58:46.84 --> 01:58:51.96
But if you want to see what Jake Smith the white buffalo looks like if you want to figure out why they call him the white buffalo

1374
01:58:53.16 --> 01:58:55.16

1375
01:58:55.16 --> 01:58:58.20

Something along those lines

1382
01:59:30.68 --> 01:59:36.28
It's just like an algorithm that if it has likes and inner engagement or whatever

1383
01:59:36.52 --> 01:59:39.40
Interactions or whatever it's sort of like oh, this is the significant video

1384
01:59:39.96 --> 01:59:46.92
So let's sort of sort of push it or whatever okay. What we're not doing this big campaign to get you to fix the algorithm

No, who said not last yes YouTube video version all good people are agreeing with me. I think you don't put effects on a podcast

1390
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.08
Or on this particular podcast, but I'm not talking to mass I'm talking on a occasional little Easter egg rolling and maybe you thought that blows up over there

1391
02:00:21.08 --> 02:00:23.08
It's a smoke maybe there's smoke

All right, so smoke coming out of jakes guitar

1393
02:00:26.68 --> 02:00:32.12
Yeah, okay, actually that's there's one thing that doesn't need it effects. It's Jake. Yeah, not did need it effects

1396
02:00:45.32 --> 02:00:50.04
One will just call it psychological warfare for now. So what it is is it is a smoking word album. Yes

1397
02:00:50.44 --> 02:00:55.08
Spoken word yeah, and those words are speaking to you on your moments of weakness

1398
02:00:55.64 --> 02:01:00.52
So if you're sure go about to skip the workout, but I can close to skipping workout two by the way

1399
02:01:01.32 --> 02:01:03.32
Yes today that's why you're looking skinny

1400
02:01:03.32 --> 02:01:05.32
Any

1401
02:01:07.40 --> 02:01:09.40
Everything you yeah

1402
02:01:09.40 --> 02:01:11.40
Is it anyway

1403
02:01:11.40 --> 02:01:16.52
Almost skip the word for the noise while we're doing this right now. Do you think everyone's annoyed or is it gets just me?

1404
02:01:16.52 --> 02:01:18.52
It's very possible

1405
02:01:18.52 --> 02:01:23.64
Everyone's annoyed but unless I think this is a moment of value in my opinion

1406
02:01:23.64 --> 02:01:27.16
Okay, I was about to skip the workout. I've listened this I didn't listen the psychological warfare

1407
02:01:27.64 --> 02:01:29.64
This was yesterday

1408
02:01:29.64 --> 02:01:35.64
You know why didn't have to I listened to it so many times before when I really needed it that it was like

1409
02:01:36.28 --> 02:01:38.60
It was sort of in the role of the X back there sort of plain

1410
02:01:40.04 --> 02:01:42.68
So I listened to it virtually in my mind and

1411
02:01:43.88 --> 02:01:48.72

1414
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.52
