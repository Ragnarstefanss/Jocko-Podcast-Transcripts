[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 54.
[00:00:06] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:10] Good evening, I go.
[00:00:11] Good evening.
[00:00:15] uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
[00:00:20] You got some Shakespeare right there.
[00:00:24] You got some Henry IV part two.
[00:00:28] And that play is a play that came just prior to Henry V, the hero, the warrior, the leader
[00:00:41] of that few, that happy few, that band of brothers.
[00:00:47] Well, his dad, Henry IV, was having a rough time in the kingdom facing rebellion.
[00:00:58] And there's a point in the play where he, the old man, Henry IV, he can't sleep.
[00:01:06] Can't sleep because the pressure, the pressure and the weight of being a leader.
[00:01:12] And it's a great, it's a great chunk of the play.
[00:01:18] And it starts with that line.
[00:01:20] On easy lies the head that wears a crown.
[00:01:23] And it actually doesn't start with that line, that's the last line.
[00:01:28] It starts off a little different.
[00:01:30] It starts off here.
[00:01:32] How many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep?
[00:01:41] So he's saying, hey, out there, you know, there's thousands and thousands of my subjects.
[00:01:45] They're out there asleep in right now.
[00:01:51] So sleep, oh, gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened me?
[00:02:00] That thou will, that thou no more will weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in
[00:02:10] forgetfulness.
[00:02:12] So he's talking to sleep.
[00:02:14] Sleep is like a, like a god to him at this point.
[00:02:16] And he said, what did I do to scare you off?
[00:02:18] What do I do? What can you bring me that goodness?
[00:02:22] Wait down my eyes.
[00:02:26] Going back, why rather sleep?
[00:02:30] Myest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching the and hushed with buzzing
[00:02:38] night flies to thy slumber?
[00:02:42] And in perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with
[00:02:50] sound of sweetest melody.
[00:02:54] So he's asking sleep.
[00:02:56] He's saying, look, sleep.
[00:02:57] You're there.
[00:02:58] You're there hanging out with the smoky filthy houses and hovels and people are sleeping
[00:03:04] on boards and to low people are sleeping.
[00:03:08] Those situations, it's insects buzzing around their heads.
[00:03:13] You sleep's all there.
[00:03:15] Taking care of those people.
[00:03:17] But sleep doesn't come to him in the most beautiful in the most luxurious, astate rooms,
[00:03:24] where there's a little gentle music playing.
[00:03:27] No bugs flying around.
[00:03:28] It's a gentle music playing.
[00:03:33] Back to the play, oh thou doggard, why lieest thou with the vile in loen some beds and
[00:03:42] leaveest thy kingly couch, a watch case, or a common larym bell.
[00:03:50] So same, same subject he's saying, look, why do you doggard, so dogg meaning sleeping?
[00:03:57] Don't worry, why are you hanging around the nastiest beds, but you know, this beautiful
[00:04:04] bed, you don't come near it.
[00:04:06] You leave it vacant, like a watch tower, like a bell tower.
[00:04:14] Will thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the ship boys eyes?
[00:04:21] So now he's talking to start talking about even a sailor at sea.
[00:04:26] High up on a mast, right, a giddy mast.
[00:04:33] You seal up the ship boys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude, imperious
[00:04:40] surge.
[00:04:42] And in the visitation of winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous
[00:04:48] heads and hanging them with deafening clamor in the slippery clouds that with the
[00:04:55] early death itself awakes.
[00:05:01] So he's saying this sailor, there's a sailor at sea who's getting punished by the storm
[00:05:07] and the thunder is cropping and the ship is bounding back and forth.
[00:05:14] But guess what?
[00:05:15] He gets to fall asleep.
[00:05:16] He goes to sleep, no problem.
[00:05:22] It's thou oparsal sleep, give thy repose to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude and in
[00:05:31] the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot the night to a
[00:05:41] king.
[00:05:43] So he's saying again, in an hour so rude storms mayhem at sea.
[00:05:50] He gives the, he gives the sailor sleep.
[00:05:53] But in this calmest and most stillest night with every available luxury to boot, yet
[00:06:04] sleep is denied to the king.
[00:06:07] And then he says, then happy low lie down, uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
[00:06:19] So then happy low lie down, he's saying, look, low by low, he means the peasants.
[00:06:24] He's like, all right, then you happy happy low, you peasants lie down, lie down, sleep.
[00:06:33] That's what you get.
[00:06:37] But uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
[00:06:41] The leader doesn't get to rest.
[00:06:45] The leader doesn't get to sleep.
[00:06:46] And that's another example of what we know and that is that leadership is hard.
[00:06:53] It's a heavy burden, it's hard business and it's part science and part art.
[00:07:03] And part of it is natural ability and part of it is learned and the book that we're going
[00:07:08] to dive into today, it isn't Shakespeare.
[00:07:12] That's actually a military manual, military manual written by SLA Marshall, but guided
[00:07:21] by George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[00:07:26] This book was written just after World War II.
[00:07:29] Now, if you remember Hackworth, if you read about face, Hackworth talks about Marshall,
[00:07:35] SLA Marshall and he did some writing in Vietnam that Hackworth was a little bit
[00:07:42] not impressed with.
[00:07:43] And there's certainly some controversy about SLA Marshall and some of the things that he wrote
[00:07:49] in some of the things that he said that he lived through, there's some controversy,
[00:07:53] if not proven fact that he fabricated some stuff.
[00:07:58] But I think you're going to find as we dive into this book, that from a leadership perspective,
[00:08:03] the experiences that he did bring back from World War I, the experiences that he got from
[00:08:07] Eisenhower and from the other Marshall.
[00:08:11] I think it's a really good reflection in a good look at some leadership lessons learned
[00:08:17] that we can take something from.
[00:08:19] Now, the book is actually called the Armed Forces Officer, very simple title, and the
[00:08:26] version that I'm going through, because this book is still in publication, the version that
[00:08:31] I'm going through is from 1950, 1950 version.
[00:08:38] Like I said, it's written in just after World War II, obviously, so the lessons are fresh.
[00:08:43] And I guess that the new version has been cleaned up or something.
[00:08:51] There's, I guess that the 1950s version isn't fully politically correct.
[00:08:56] I don't know because to be frank, I haven't read the new version, because I got the old
[00:09:00] version.
[00:09:01] I want the real deal.
[00:09:03] And I don't find anything offensive in this one, so maybe someone else will.
[00:09:08] I guess there's some things that might be a little bit borderline, but yeah, I'm not,
[00:09:14] I'm not really feeling it.
[00:09:16] And this book was given me a long time ago by a friend of mine that said, you might
[00:09:19] like this.
[00:09:20] And he specifically said, this boy, they'll make this one anymore.
[00:09:24] But guess what?
[00:09:25] Everyone's in love because they do.
[00:09:27] They brought it back.
[00:09:28] They brought it back.
[00:09:30] So the book is the Armed Forces Officer, and it really goes into how to lead, how to lead.
[00:09:38] So go into the book.
[00:09:40] To call forth great loyalty and other people and to harness it to any noble undertaking, one
[00:09:48] must first be sensible of their finer instincts and feelings.
[00:09:54] Certainly, these things at least are among the gentle qualities which are desired in every
[00:10:02] military officer of the United States.
[00:10:04] So here's some basic things that the officers, the military are supposed to have.
[00:10:10] One, strong belief in human rights.
[00:10:12] Two, respect for the dignity of every other person.
[00:10:16] Three, the golden rule attitude toward one's daily associates.
[00:10:23] Four, an abiding interest in all aspects of human welfare.
[00:10:28] Five, a willingness to deal with every man as considerably as if he were a blood relative.
[00:10:37] So pretty simple rules.
[00:10:40] Respect other people.
[00:10:41] The golden rule, you know, treat people how you want to be treated yourself.
[00:10:45] These are the basis what they're saying, you need to be.
[00:10:48] And again, let's not actually, I was going to go into this, but they're going to go into
[00:10:51] themselves.
[00:10:52] Here we go.
[00:10:53] Back to the book.
[00:10:54] The epitome of strength, not of softness.
[00:10:59] They marked a man who's capable of pursuing a great purpose consistently in spite of temptations.
[00:11:06] He who possesses them will all the more surely be regarded as a man among men.
[00:11:13] Take any crowd of new recruits.
[00:11:15] The greater number of them during their first few days in service will use more profanity
[00:11:19] and obscenity.
[00:11:20] Let's talk more about women and boast more about drinking than they have ever done in their
[00:11:24] lives because of the mistaken idea that this is the quick way to get a reputation for being
[00:11:30] a hard-boiled.
[00:11:32] But at the same time, the one or two men among them who stay decent, talk moderately
[00:11:38] and walk the line of duty will uniquely receive the infinite respect of the others.
[00:11:46] It never fails to happen.
[00:11:50] So little contrary to what we might think.
[00:11:53] And there's definitely, when you get the military and you're going through boot camp,
[00:11:56] there's all kinds of people act in tough guys.
[00:11:58] All kinds of people act in tough guys.
[00:12:01] And that happens to see one thing that happens in boot camp.
[00:12:06] I bet I met more potential professional athletes when I was going through.
[00:12:11] When I was going through boot camp, everyone was, I was about to go in the NFL.
[00:12:15] I was about to be a pro baseball player.
[00:12:17] I don't know why, but they end up in the military.
[00:12:21] Yeah, it is interesting.
[00:12:23] That kind of like the guy who's 500 in the streets.
[00:12:26] Yeah.
[00:12:27] They come to the MMA gym.
[00:12:28] That guy doesn't work out too well.
[00:12:31] Alright, and obviously I'm abridging this book a little bit, skipping through.
[00:12:37] Here we go back to the book, Men Be Get Good Will in Other Men by Giving It.
[00:12:42] They develop courage and they're following mainly as a reflection of the courage, which
[00:12:47] they show in their own action.
[00:12:50] These two qualities of mind and heart are the essence of sound, officer ship.
[00:12:56] One is of little avail without the other and either helps to sustain the other.
[00:13:02] So you got goodwill and you got courage and they help each other and they sustain each other.
[00:13:10] Back to the book, as to which is the stronger force in its impact upon the masses of men.
[00:13:15] No truth is more certain than the words once written by William James.
[00:13:21] Evident, though the shortcomings of a man may be, if he is ready to give up his life
[00:13:26] for a cause, we forgive him everything.
[00:13:30] However inferior he may be to ourselves and other respects, if we cling to life while
[00:13:35] he throws it away like a flower, we bow to his superiority.
[00:13:40] So I guess courage gets the stronger nod out of that situation.
[00:13:46] Back to the book, Peter Roosevelt once said, if he had a son who refrained from any worthwhile
[00:13:51] action because of the fear of hurt to himself, he would disown him.
[00:13:57] Soon after his return to civilian life, General Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke of the
[00:14:02] worthy worth whileness of living dangerously.
[00:14:06] On officer of the United States armed forces cannot go far wrong if he holds these ideas.
[00:14:12] It is not the suitable profession for those who believe only in digging in and nursing a soft
[00:14:17] snap until death comes at a ripe old age.
[00:14:21] Who risks nothing gains nothing.
[00:14:24] Nor should there be any room in it for professional smugness, small jellacies and undue
[00:14:31] concern about privilege.
[00:14:36] So you can't be hiding all the time.
[00:14:40] You got to step up, you got to lead, you got to take some risk, you got to leave dangerously.
[00:14:44] Now of course, young troopers out there, especially guys out on the battlefield, this doesn't
[00:14:49] mean running to your death.
[00:14:50] That's not what it means.
[00:14:54] You will take risk in business world, you'll take risk.
[00:14:58] In the military, you'll take risk.
[00:15:00] If you do either in business or in a military, you take risk stupidly, you'll die or you'll
[00:15:07] lose all your money.
[00:15:09] Neither one of those is good.
[00:15:12] But that doesn't mean you hide and doesn't mean you take no risk and you shy away.
[00:15:18] Now the next part, when he's talking about small jellacies and undue concern about privilege,
[00:15:23] this eats people up and destroys people.
[00:15:27] And that light here we go back to the book towards services other than his own.
[00:15:31] Any officer is expected to have both a comradly feeling and an imaginative interest.
[00:15:39] Any army officer is a better man for having studied the works of Admiral Mayhand and familiar
[00:15:45] lies himself with the modern navy from first-hand experience.
[00:15:49] Those who lead sea going forces can enlarge their own capacities by knowing more rather
[00:15:54] than less about the nature of the air and ground establishments.
[00:15:58] The sub-mariner can always learn something useful to his own work by mingling with airmen.
[00:16:03] The airmen becomes a better officer as he grows in qualified knowledge of ground and
[00:16:08] sea fighting.
[00:16:10] So you've got to learn.
[00:16:12] Working with other industries?
[00:16:14] Learn about those industries.
[00:16:15] Learn as much as you can.
[00:16:17] Don't just stay in your own little world because your comfort lesson would happen to
[00:16:21] a lot of us.
[00:16:22] You get comfortable in your own world so that's what you want to stay in.
[00:16:25] You don't want to look bad.
[00:16:27] You don't want to appear to be ignorant.
[00:16:28] And Admiral Mayhand is kind of the, well, he was a civil war Admiral as a matter of fact,
[00:16:34] but wrote a book called The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, which the Germans and
[00:16:40] the Japanese both utilized against the whole world, too.
[00:16:43] So a little bit of a little bit of a risk there, but it's also something that guided the
[00:16:47] fought and the building of the modern US Navy.
[00:16:52] Now we talk a little bit about what life is like in the military back to the book.
[00:16:57] The military way is a long, hard road.
[00:17:01] And it makes extraordinary requirements of every individual.
[00:17:05] In war, particularly it puts stresses upon men such as they have not known elsewhere.
[00:17:11] And the temptation to get out from under would be irresistible if their spirits had not
[00:17:16] been tempered to the ordeal.
[00:17:19] So you got to be ready for the hardest.
[00:17:20] You got to do things in your life that get you ready for the hardness back to the book.
[00:17:24] If nothing but fear, and this is what we're getting to some leadership, if nothing but
[00:17:28] fear of punishments were dependent upon to hold men to the line during extreme trial,
[00:17:35] the result would be wholesale, mutiny, and a situation altogether beyond the control of leadership.
[00:17:42] So if the only thing, the only reason that your people are following you because it's
[00:17:45] because of fear of punishment, when the going gets hard, that's not going to work.
[00:17:53] So it must be true that it is the out, that is out of the impact of ideals.
[00:18:00] Out of the impact of ideals, mainly that men develop the strength to face situations,
[00:18:05] which would be normal to run away, which it would be normal to run away.
[00:18:10] So during the normal routine of peace, members of the armed services are expected to respond
[00:18:16] to situations that are more extensive, more complex, then take longer to reach fulfillment
[00:18:21] than the situations to which the majority of men instinctively respond.
[00:18:25] So things in the military take a long time in your big part of that in a peace time,
[00:18:29] big bureaucratic machine, it can be really challenging.
[00:18:33] Even the length of the enlistment period looks like a slow march up a 60 mile grade.
[00:18:40] The motion is slow, duty frequently, monotonous.
[00:18:44] It is all too easy for the individual to worry about his own insignificance and to feel
[00:18:49] that he has become lost in the crowd.
[00:18:53] Now this is something that I hear a lot about on social media.
[00:18:57] More people send me messages on this or Facebook messages, I guess, when they feel like
[00:19:03] they're caught in a rut, you know, they're doing their job, they don't really like it.
[00:19:07] What should I do?
[00:19:09] And I think this next little section applies to that back to the book, what is the main
[00:19:13] test of human character?
[00:19:16] Probably it is this, that a man will know how to be patient in the midst of hard circumstance
[00:19:24] and can continue to be personally effective while living through whatever discouragements
[00:19:30] beset him and his companions.
[00:19:34] Can you drive on?
[00:19:35] That's what it's asking.
[00:19:36] Those are the job that you don't like?
[00:19:38] Good.
[00:19:39] Good.
[00:19:40] It's a little test.
[00:19:42] Now, if you're in a situation that you don't like, you drive on in that situation and
[00:19:47] also you figure out what your exit is going to be.
[00:19:49] Because you don't want to go through life miserable.
[00:19:51] You figure out, you start saving your money, you start getting on another education,
[00:19:55] you figure out how to do the job, you get yourself promoted, you do what you've got to
[00:19:57] do.
[00:19:58] But don't let that monotonous job that you're not into that date, don't let that bird
[00:20:02] you down.
[00:20:03] Yeah.
[00:20:04] You drive on in life.
[00:20:08] You don't necessarily have to drive on and keep doing that job.
[00:20:12] You drive on as opposed to, oh, start complaining or going to some thing where you get
[00:20:18] self-destruct, ever you see some kind of escapees out later, something like that.
[00:20:23] But I'll tell you, you drive on, you have other options, right?
[00:20:28] You work those other options.
[00:20:29] But whatever it is that your job is and you kick acid that job.
[00:20:32] That's what you do.
[00:20:33] The minute you start slack and you're going backwards, don't do it.
[00:20:36] It's not going to be what benefit are you going to get from that.
[00:20:38] You're going to get zero benefit.
[00:20:39] You're going to work your eight hours a day.
[00:20:41] You're going to make your $12 an hour.
[00:20:44] Are you going to do it in a slack way?
[00:20:46] Yeah.
[00:20:47] Or are you going to do it in an awesome way?
[00:20:49] Right.
[00:20:50] You know, I'm going to do it in an awesome way.
[00:20:52] Yeah.
[00:20:53] And that's what's going to get you promoted.
[00:20:54] That's what's going to get you.
[00:20:55] That's what's going to get you taking care of.
[00:20:57] In the long run.
[00:20:58] If you, or you, you, like you say this a lot, where you, like you're going to get
[00:21:02] out where you, like even if you're going to do something, even if you don't enjoy, you still
[00:21:05] you do it just the best you can.
[00:21:06] You said that like from the beginning.
[00:21:08] And for someone like me when I look at it like that, of course it sounds like
[00:21:15] good idea.
[00:21:16] Do it that way.
[00:21:17] But after you do it, you kind of think back.
[00:21:19] And I've done both.
[00:21:20] I've done it where I'm like, well, I hate doing this.
[00:21:22] So I'm just going to basically go through the motions until it's finally done.
[00:21:26] You know, and I can be relieved or whatever.
[00:21:29] But when you think back of like, hey, remember when I was doing whatever it is that job or
[00:21:34] whatever, when you look back, you kind of have this fulfillment that you did it the best
[00:21:40] you get.
[00:21:41] You never look back and be like, dang, I'm glad I've phoned it in.
[00:21:44] You know, you're always, you're going even if you didn't like it.
[00:21:47] Like you, you're always satisfied that that, yeah, I did it the best that I could.
[00:21:51] So do it.
[00:21:52] Yeah.
[00:21:53] Do it the best you can.
[00:21:55] Now, here's a couple of the lists in this book. Here's another one.
[00:21:59] This is the one that's talking about the simple virtues that provide a firm foundation.
[00:22:06] So here we go.
[00:22:08] One, a man has honor.
[00:22:10] If he holds himself to a course of conduct because of a conviction that it is in the general interest,
[00:22:18] even though he is well aware that it may lead to inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or
[00:22:24] grave physical risk.
[00:22:25] So when he says general interest, he's talking about like the team.
[00:22:28] So you're going to hold that conviction, even if it's good for the team, you're going to hold that course.
[00:22:33] Even if you're well aware that it may lead to inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or grave physical risk.
[00:22:40] Boom.
[00:22:41] That's what honor is.
[00:22:42] You know, here, honor laid out that well.
[00:22:44] Very often.
[00:22:45] He has veracity.
[00:22:47] If having studied a question to the limit of his ability, he says and believes what he thinks to be true.
[00:22:53] Even though it would be the path of least resistance to deceive others and himself.
[00:23:01] So this is kind of in the same vein.
[00:23:04] If you look at something and maybe you don't agree with it, but the easiest thing to do is just be agree with it.
[00:23:09] No, you don't do that.
[00:23:10] You step on saying, no, I don't agree with this.
[00:23:13] Now we could go into detail on that.
[00:23:15] In the time is when you, when you do want to maybe not be the most truthful person in the world.
[00:23:22] For instance, we've talked about this before when your wife is making chicken and it's dry.
[00:23:28] Right?
[00:23:29] It might not be the best thing to tell her the amount of water that you're going to need to drink.
[00:23:35] So, but in real things and important things, tell the truth.
[00:23:42] Back to the book.
[00:23:43] Number three, he has justice.
[00:23:44] If he acknowledges the interests of all concerned in any particular transaction, rather than serving his own apparent.
[00:23:51] And his own apparent interest.
[00:23:53] Look out for others.
[00:23:55] Number four, he has graciousness.
[00:23:57] If he acts and speaks forthrightly, agrees warmly, disagree fairly and respectfully.
[00:24:05] Participates enthusiastically.
[00:24:08] Refrains from harboring grudges.
[00:24:12] Takes his reverses in stride and does not complain or ask for help in the face of trifling.
[00:24:19] Calamities.
[00:24:23] Those are just solid.
[00:24:25] Those are just solid.
[00:24:26] I would say this though.
[00:24:27] Sometimes you got to ask for help.
[00:24:29] Right?
[00:24:30] That's one thing that I wouldn't work with businesses.
[00:24:32] There'll be somebody that's, you know, I'm the extreme ownership and I'm an own this.
[00:24:37] And all of a sudden you realize, hey, you're own in that, but you're not going to be successful at it.
[00:24:40] Because that's too much for you.
[00:24:42] You need help.
[00:24:43] You need to, you need to put your ego in check.
[00:24:45] And you need to be able to raise your hand and say, look, I need some help on this.
[00:24:48] I don't have this covered.
[00:24:49] This is too much for me.
[00:24:50] I want to expect in this.
[00:24:51] Here's my hands in the air.
[00:24:52] Let me, let me get some help.
[00:24:53] Sometimes seems like it's not necessarily even ego.
[00:24:56] It's more like, oh, I guess it in a way to ego, but it's more like, shoot.
[00:24:59] I don't want to be the guy who has to be dependent on somebody or something like that.
[00:25:04] Like, you know, which is what?
[00:25:05] Extreme ownership.
[00:25:06] Which is ego.
[00:25:07] Actually, if you're the guy that doesn't want to be dependent on other people, that's probably
[00:25:10] ego.
[00:25:11] But you are, I think what you're trying to say is that I don't want to be the guy that has to ask for help.
[00:25:16] I want to be the guy that carries my own load.
[00:25:17] Like, you know what?
[00:25:18] I'd see this on seal patrols.
[00:25:20] A couple times in my career where guys were overloaded and they didn't want to ask for help.
[00:25:27] Right.
[00:25:28] I got this.
[00:25:29] Because it's humiliating.
[00:25:30] You know, hey, can you carry my ammunition or hey, can you carry my radio?
[00:25:34] Yeah.
[00:25:35] Can you carry my weapon?
[00:25:36] That's, I've seen it happen.
[00:25:39] I've carried some extra weapons from time to time.
[00:25:42] It's a bummer, you know?
[00:25:44] And you know what?
[00:25:46] You take the weapon?
[00:25:47] Hey, man, okay, get the water in you.
[00:25:50] You know?
[00:25:51] But that's what you're talking about.
[00:25:52] People don't want to be that guy.
[00:25:53] But what's going to be worse if they don't take a load off and they get heat casualty
[00:26:00] and now they're down.
[00:26:01] Well, now we're now I've got to carry him.
[00:26:03] Not this is weapon.
[00:26:05] Which is a bad thing.
[00:26:06] We don't have him anymore.
[00:26:07] Yeah.
[00:26:08] Yeah.
[00:26:09] And he can't take a fight.
[00:26:10] He can't even do anything.
[00:26:12] As opposed to the other guy who doesn't know the difference between needing help and
[00:26:16] wanting help.
[00:26:17] Yeah.
[00:26:18] And he knows just like, well help me.
[00:26:19] Yeah.
[00:26:20] Because he don't want to work.
[00:26:21] I had a guy who had we were on a long patrol.
[00:26:24] This is back in the day, back in the day.
[00:26:27] This is pre-war.
[00:26:29] And my radio meant, because I was a radio man when I was in the city.
[00:26:32] And now it wasn't a radio man.
[00:26:34] I was an officer and we were on a long patrol.
[00:26:37] And my radio man was going down.
[00:26:39] Like he was, didn't have enough water.
[00:26:41] He was dehydrated.
[00:26:42] And so he was bummed.
[00:26:44] He couldn't keep up with this anymore.
[00:26:48] And I said, OK, let me get you radio.
[00:26:50] So I'm taking a 20 pound radio off his back.
[00:26:52] Put him in my back.
[00:26:53] And I'm carrying it for a little bit, I don't know.
[00:26:55] A half a day.
[00:26:56] And then we get to a, like, a layup point.
[00:26:59] So this is where we're going to first civilian.
[00:27:01] This is where we're going to camp out for the night.
[00:27:03] And when we get there, we get a resupply of water and, you know,
[00:27:07] gate or gate or whatever.
[00:27:08] So all of a sudden now everyone's rehydrated.
[00:27:11] And while we're in there, we got to make a community
[00:27:13] and we got to make a communications hit to, you know,
[00:27:16] got to call headquarters and say, hey, this is our location.
[00:27:19] So he comes and takes the radio out of my, out of my backpack.
[00:27:25] You know, it comes over and hit the radio.
[00:27:26] So I can make this communication.
[00:27:27] I go, yeah, cool, open up my bag.
[00:27:29] Give it to him.
[00:27:30] And, you know, he makes the radio communications.
[00:27:33] And I'm out doing, like, a reconnaissance of the area to find out what
[00:27:36] wrote we're going to take.
[00:27:38] Anyways, I thought, you know, not his rehydrated.
[00:27:41] He's going to take that radio and, you know, we'll be back in the back of the game.
[00:27:44] So I come back and when I get back, the radio was sitting on my rock set.
[00:27:49] Oh, my god.
[00:27:51] Oh, my god.
[00:27:52] Oh, no.
[00:27:53] But you know what I did?
[00:27:54] Put it back in my rock set.
[00:27:55] I'm scared of it.
[00:27:56] Yeah, you just gotta do it.
[00:27:57] But yeah, so you, you don't want to be that guy.
[00:27:59] Yeah.
[00:28:00] Once you get rehydrated, man, get your way back on.
[00:28:02] Yeah.
[00:28:03] That difference between needing help and a one.
[00:28:07] Yeah.
[00:28:08] And he did need help.
[00:28:09] Yeah.
[00:28:10] But once the gate of raids come in, you know, you're going to go.
[00:28:13] Yeah.
[00:28:14] You did take that radio back.
[00:28:16] I was, I was a chuckling inside when I saw that radio been placed back on top of my
[00:28:21] Ronin side, but just placed on the, yeah, you got it from here.
[00:28:24] Yeah, you put it back in.
[00:28:25] Thanks.
[00:28:26] And we'll be all good here.
[00:28:27] Awesome.
[00:28:28] Good times and the teams.
[00:28:31] And the last one here, he has integrity.
[00:28:35] If his interest in the good of the service is at all times greater than
[00:28:39] his personal pride.
[00:28:40] And when he holds himself to the same line of duty when unobserved as he would follow
[00:28:46] if all his superiors were present.
[00:28:50] This is the classic.
[00:28:51] What do you do when you're not people on a look at me?
[00:28:54] Here's another point.
[00:28:58] The cause of much of the friction in administrative machinery is that at all levels, there are individuals who insist on standing
[00:29:08] in their own light.
[00:29:09] Now, this is a term that I actually had to look up standing in your own light.
[00:29:12] It means getting your own way.
[00:29:13] It means you're preventing your, you're preventing your, you're preventing your own success.
[00:29:17] And he uses the term of lunch in here, standing in your own light.
[00:29:21] This is important.
[00:29:22] They believe that there is some special magic.
[00:29:26] Some quick springboard to success.
[00:29:28] They mistakenly think that it can be won by bootlicking, apple polishing, yesing higher
[00:29:37] authority, playing office politics, throwing weight around, ducking the issue, striving for cheap popularity,
[00:29:44] courting publicity, or seeking any and all means of grabbing the spotlight.
[00:29:50] So this is the guy.
[00:29:51] Everybody that's listening to this podcast right now knows who I'm talking about.
[00:29:55] That guy, that guy that's just always trying to kiss everyone's ass and make himself look good.
[00:30:02] And that's, you know, that's a shortcut, right?
[00:30:05] Marshall saying is a, is a shortcut or a springboard.
[00:30:09] You think it's a quick springboard.
[00:30:12] Back to the book, any one of this set of tricks may enable a man to carry the ball forward, a yard or two,
[00:30:18] in some special situation.
[00:30:21] But at least this comment can be made without qualification of the men who have risen to supreme heights in the fighting
[00:30:27] establishment of the United States and have had their greatness proclaimed by their fellow
[00:30:32] countrymen. There is not one career which provides any warrant for the conclusion that there is a special
[00:30:38] shortcut known only to this smart operators.
[00:30:43] Too enough, a few men have gained fairly high rank by dint of what late Mr. Justice Holmes called the
[00:30:50] instinct for the jugular, a feeling of wind to jump and wear to press and how to slash in order to achieve
[00:30:56] somewhat predatory personal ends.
[00:31:00] That will occasionally happen in any walk-a life. And I say this all the time, I've said this on this podcast.
[00:31:05] But if you got that guy that we're talking about, sometimes they're going to get a better recommendation.
[00:31:09] You, but sometimes they're going to get, they're going to get that promotion that you were wanting and you,
[00:31:13] you just, you just held the line and were a good person. That person took the credit for something and no one really
[00:31:17] realized next thing, you know, they get the promotion.
[00:31:19] But I agree with what's being said here, that does happen sometimes in every walk of life, but in the long run,
[00:31:25] that person's going down.
[00:31:27] That person's going down in the long run. And the more you kind of depend on that sort of thing,
[00:31:32] the less likely for any kind of success. And you absolutely, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:38] And he says here, but from Washington, Wayne and Jones down to Eisenhower, Van Degriff and
[00:31:45] Nimitz, the best, the men best loved by the American people for their military successes were also the men with
[00:31:52] greatness of soul.
[00:31:59] During World War II, there were quite a few higher commanders relieved in our forces, because
[00:32:05] it was judged for one reason or another that they had failed in battle. So relieved means you got fired.
[00:32:10] Of the total number, there were a few who took a reduction in rank, went willingly to a lower post
[00:32:16] in a fighting command. Other, no complaint kept their chins up, worked courageously and sympathetically with their commands,
[00:32:23] and provided an example of manhood that all who saw them will never forget.
[00:32:28] So if you get, I get asked this, I've got, I've got, been asked this a couple times. I got demoted.
[00:32:32] Or sometimes not demoted, but I got passed over, you know, someone else got promoted instead of me, what should I do?
[00:32:38] Get after it. That's what these guys did.
[00:32:41] That's what these guys did. Hey, screwed up. You know what? Check.
[00:32:44] All right, cool. Let's, let's, here's what I messed up. That was my fault. I'm ready to rock and roll. You put me down.
[00:32:49] Put me in charge of less people. I got it. I'm going to do well.
[00:32:53] Though their names need not be mentioned, they were imprinted with the real virtue of the services,
[00:32:59] even more deeply than many of their colleagues who had no blemishes on their records.
[00:33:03] Their character had met the ultimate test.
[00:33:06] The men who had the privilege of working close to them realized this and the supply,
[00:33:12] the supply, my effect of his personal influence helped strengthen the resolve of many others.
[00:33:17] So it's actually inspirational to people around you when they see that.
[00:33:21] And there's been many guys that I'm known that it bounced back for some kind of, from some kind of, you know, career problem.
[00:33:27] They mess something up. They got, they got fired.
[00:33:31] And they take it. They be humble about it. And they come back and turn it around.
[00:33:35] The person that complains and thinks that they're a victim, not going to work out for them.
[00:33:41] That's an, in the civilian sector and in the military sector.
[00:33:44] Now,
[00:33:46] Let's start talking a little bit about being a recruit.
[00:33:50] And the kind of the mental training, the mindset training that happens as a recruit to the book,
[00:33:57] his perseverance and the care of weapons,
[00:34:00] in keeping his living quarters orderly,
[00:34:03] and in doing his full share of work is best ensured,
[00:34:07] not through fear of punishments, but by stimulating his belief that any other way of going is unworthy of a member of a fighting service.
[00:34:17] Precision in personal habits, precision in drill and precision in daily living are the high road to that kind of discipline,
[00:34:28] which best ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field of battle.
[00:34:36] I can tell you,
[00:34:41] Yeah,
[00:34:43] You know,
[00:34:44] it's just, it's basically he's talking about the, the unmedicated daily discipline and all things.
[00:34:49] That's what it is.
[00:34:50] And that ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field of battle.
[00:34:55] Like I'm not going to say about that other than yes,
[00:34:57] Amen.
[00:34:59] Here's another little section.
[00:35:03] When men are well led,
[00:35:06] they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see fit to put before them.
[00:35:13] Let's think about that.
[00:35:15] When men are well led,
[00:35:17] they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see fit to put before them.
[00:35:24] So what we're talking about here is when somebody's a good leader,
[00:35:28] the the troopers around them,
[00:35:30] the people that are working for them,
[00:35:32] they start to believe the whole body everything,
[00:35:36] right?
[00:35:37] They start to believe everything that you're saying.
[00:35:39] And that's powerful.
[00:35:41] That's obviously powerful.
[00:35:42] Yeah, it kind of goes back to like what you're saying about like if you're,
[00:35:46] if they fear your punishment,
[00:35:48] that's how you lead you know,
[00:35:49] I'm just,
[00:35:50] and they fear the punishment.
[00:35:51] So they're going to do enough to not get punished,
[00:35:54] but they won't do anything that they don't have to.
[00:35:57] Yeah.
[00:35:58] So it's only what they have to do.
[00:36:00] So you won't get people doing their best.
[00:36:02] You know, I mean, so.
[00:36:04] Yeah.
[00:36:05] Yeah.
[00:36:05] And that that punishment piece that I kind of breathed through is,
[00:36:08] is not through fear of punishments,
[00:36:10] but by stimulating is belief that any other way.
[00:36:13] So that's 100% right.
[00:36:15] And we just, you know, I say at all time,
[00:36:16] if you,
[00:36:17] if you,
[00:36:17] if you're,
[00:36:17] if you're doing what you told them to do just because they're afraid of you,
[00:36:19] sure,
[00:36:20] you can get,
[00:36:21] that's going to work for a little while,
[00:36:22] you know,
[00:36:22] oh,
[00:36:23] I'll fire you.
[00:36:23] Okay.
[00:36:24] What's that person doing when we get to him,
[00:36:25] putting his,
[00:36:26] putting his resume on monster.com,
[00:36:28] looking for another job.
[00:36:29] So that's not to get fired.
[00:36:30] If you're not doing it,
[00:36:31] but that's not to get fired is,
[00:36:32] is.
[00:36:34] Alright.
[00:36:35] Going back to the book,
[00:36:36] Vowage has been said before,
[00:36:37] even so it can be said again.
[00:36:39] It is paramount and overriding responsibility of every officer to take care of his men before,
[00:36:43] caring for himself.
[00:36:45] Yet many junior officers do not seem to understand that steadfast,
[00:36:50] steadfast fidelity to it is required,
[00:36:54] not lip service.
[00:36:56] And of this,
[00:36:58] as Admiral Mahan would say,
[00:37:00] man would say,
[00:37:01] comes much evil.
[00:37:03] The loyalty of men simply cannot be commanded
[00:37:07] when they become
[00:37:08] in biddered by selfish action.
[00:37:12] So a minute,
[00:37:13] your troops see that you're being selfish,
[00:37:16] or you're doing this for yourself.
[00:37:17] That's the beginning of,
[00:37:19] but what he says,
[00:37:20] Admiral Mahan says much evil.
[00:37:23] He says evil comes from that.
[00:37:25] When you start acting selfishly as a leader,
[00:37:26] evil comes from that.
[00:37:27] If an officer is on a tour with an enlisted man,
[00:37:29] he takes care of the man,
[00:37:30] he takes care of the man,
[00:37:31] he takes care that the man is accommodated as to food,
[00:37:33] shelter medical treatment,
[00:37:34] or other prime needs before satisfying his own wants.
[00:37:38] If that means that the last meal,
[00:37:40] or the last bed is gone,
[00:37:42] his duty is to get along the hard way,
[00:37:44] boom.
[00:37:46] Take care of your people.
[00:37:48] Now, again, this is written in 1950,
[00:38:02] but even in 1950,
[00:38:04] you might think this is the hard post-war of the war.
[00:38:06] Two, chapter eight is actually called
[00:38:09] getting along with people.
[00:38:12] Boom.
[00:38:13] Now, here's a real,
[00:38:15] some of this stuff is so simple.
[00:38:17] So obvious.
[00:38:18] It's so simple and so obvious that they had to write a book about it,
[00:38:21] so that people could do it because we all failed to do it.
[00:38:23] So here we go.
[00:38:24] If you like people,
[00:38:26] if you seek contact with them rather than hiding yourself in a corner,
[00:38:30] if you study your fellow men sympathetically,
[00:38:33] if you try consistently to contribute to something to this success and happiness,
[00:38:39] or contribute something to their success and happiness,
[00:38:42] if you are reasonably generous with your thoughts and your time,
[00:38:46] if you have a partial reserve with everyone,
[00:38:50] but a seeming reserve with no one.
[00:38:54] If you work to be interesting rather than spend to be a good fellow,
[00:39:00] you will get along with your sub-erears,
[00:39:02] your sub-ordinates,
[00:39:03] your orderly, your roommate,
[00:39:05] and the human race.
[00:39:07] That's it.
[00:39:08] That's all you got.
[00:39:09] If you want to get along with everybody,
[00:39:10] now one of the ones that I,
[00:39:12] you know,
[00:39:13] these are all pretty obvious,
[00:39:14] but one of the ones,
[00:39:15] if you have a partial reserve with everyone,
[00:39:18] but a seeming reserve with no one.
[00:39:21] So what that means is you're not just flying off the handle.
[00:39:24] You're just reserved a little bit.
[00:39:26] You're just, you show restraint,
[00:39:28] but the restraint doesn't come across as a loophonist,
[00:39:31] right?
[00:39:32] It's not so much,
[00:39:33] you know,
[00:39:33] if I come into a room,
[00:39:34] and I'm going to show restraint,
[00:39:35] so I'm not going to say hi to you,
[00:39:37] I'm going to come across as a loof and you're not going to like me.
[00:39:40] But if I,
[00:39:41] but if I was a walkin' to go echo my brother, give me a hug.
[00:39:44] Well, you're not going to like me either.
[00:39:46] Well I,
[00:39:47] well I,
[00:39:47] well you're one of the few people.
[00:39:49] Well that's the Hawaiian in you.
[00:39:50] A lohospiro.
[00:39:51] Let's hear it.
[00:39:52] You know?
[00:39:53] So,
[00:39:54] so it's,
[00:39:55] it's that measured reserve that measure restraint,
[00:39:58] that balance is a little bit back out of me there.
[00:40:00] So I gotta find the good,
[00:40:01] good spot in the middle.
[00:40:03] Again,
[00:40:05] getting along with people,
[00:40:07] back to the book,
[00:40:08] scores of thousands, precepts, and platitudes have been written for the guidance of personal
[00:40:13] conduct.
[00:40:15] The odd part is that, despite all of this labor, most of the frictions in modern society
[00:40:21] arise from the individuals feeling of inferiority.
[00:40:25] His false pride, his vanity, his unwillingness to yield space to any other man.
[00:40:34] Unwillingness to yield space to any of them.
[00:40:36] And I get hit on this one a lot because, again, because of my personality can be a little
[00:40:41] bit forceful.
[00:40:43] People think I'm just no compromise.
[00:40:45] My way or the highway.
[00:40:47] And this is what they're talking about.
[00:40:48] I'm not like that.
[00:40:49] I'm open to suggestions.
[00:40:51] I'm willing to say, you know what, that's a better idea.
[00:40:53] Or you know what?
[00:40:54] I like your idea.
[00:40:55] Could we make this adjustment to it?
[00:40:57] Or yes, I can change my idea to fit with what you're saying, because it makes sense.
[00:41:01] People that don't do that have unwillingness to yield space to any other man.
[00:41:05] And continuing on and his consequent urge to throw his own weight around.
[00:41:13] Right?
[00:41:14] These are just ways to not get along with people and speaking of ways to get not
[00:41:17] get along with people.
[00:41:18] Here's the 13 mistakes.
[00:41:21] The 13 mistakes.
[00:41:23] This is from the United States Coast Guard magazine.
[00:41:27] 13 pitfalls.
[00:41:28] Here we go.
[00:41:29] One to attempt to set up your own personal, to attempt to set up your own standard of
[00:41:35] right and wrong.
[00:41:37] To try to measure the enjoyment of others by your own, to expect uniformity of opinions in
[00:41:46] the world, to fail to make allowance for inexperience.
[00:41:51] It's a good one.
[00:41:53] To endeavor to mold all dispositions alike, not to yield on an important trifles, same
[00:42:02] thing we just heard.
[00:42:03] The things that don't matter who cares, let the guys do what they're going to do on
[00:42:08] that.
[00:42:10] To look for perfection in our own actions.
[00:42:14] To worry ourselves and others about what can't be remedied.
[00:42:19] Why you worried about that can't change it?
[00:42:22] Let's not worry about it.
[00:42:23] Let's just move on.
[00:42:27] Here's a big one, not to help everybody, wherever, however, whenever we can.
[00:42:33] That's a big ask.
[00:42:34] That's a big request.
[00:42:36] Now, you know what I want you to do in your life?
[00:42:38] Help everybody, however, wherever and whenever you can.
[00:42:43] That's asking a lot.
[00:42:44] That's a big one.
[00:42:47] To consider impossible what we cannot ourselves perform.
[00:42:51] I can't even do that.
[00:42:54] To believe only what our finite minds can grasp.
[00:43:00] Must say that one again, to believe only what our finite minds can grasp.
[00:43:06] That's humility.
[00:43:07] To recognize that you don't understand everything in the world.
[00:43:11] I don't understand everything in the world.
[00:43:13] It's okay.
[00:43:15] There's things beyond my comprehension.
[00:43:17] That's okay.
[00:43:18] You got to admit to that.
[00:43:21] You got to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.
[00:43:27] To estimate by some outside quality when it is that within, which makes the man.
[00:43:38] So, very simple.
[00:43:41] Interesting how you can make allowances for our according to the 13 things.
[00:43:48] You can make allowances for inexperience.
[00:43:50] But not the weakness of others.
[00:43:52] No, it says not to make.
[00:43:56] This would be a mistake.
[00:43:57] It would be a mistake not to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.
[00:44:00] Also, he said, okay, next to like.
[00:44:01] You got to just say, this guy's, you know, I got to make allowances.
[00:44:06] Flex a little bit.
[00:44:07] He's got to fight off the handle.
[00:44:14] Back to the book.
[00:44:15] I used to say that when any officer has the inexcusable fault that he takes snap judgment
[00:44:21] on his own men, he will not be any different in his relations with all other people.
[00:44:28] And we'll stand in his own light for the duration of his career again.
[00:44:31] There's that term.
[00:44:32] If you're making snap judgments of people, you're not going to do them justice.
[00:44:40] And that's something that I always very careful about because I've talked about it before
[00:44:43] in the SEAL teams.
[00:44:44] Your reputation is very, very important.
[00:44:47] And everybody that's done something stupid in the SEAL teams, every single person knows it.
[00:44:53] I mean, at a high level of stupidity, if you do something really stupid, everybody knows
[00:44:59] about it.
[00:45:00] And then minor stupid things, a lot of people will know about it.
[00:45:02] And so you develop a reputation over time.
[00:45:06] And it's very easy to fall in that category of all iron disguise, you know, kind of a
[00:45:11] turd or whatever, and not give them a chance.
[00:45:15] But I always, I always try to give people a chance and say, okay, let me see what this
[00:45:18] guy's really like.
[00:45:19] And I guess I would take a little personal challenge if it was a guy that was going
[00:45:21] to be working for me.
[00:45:24] Let's see if I can make this guy rock and roll.
[00:45:25] You know, let me see if I can make this guy into a solid seal.
[00:45:30] Can't always pull it off.
[00:45:31] But sometimes you can't just need that second chance.
[00:45:35] Some people go too far with the mistakes that they made, don't they don't get a second
[00:45:38] chance?
[00:45:41] Okay, we've talked about this before.
[00:45:43] Let's talk about it again.
[00:45:45] Here we go.
[00:45:46] The man who will not listen never develops whits enough to distinguish between a bore and
[00:45:51] a sage and therefore cannot pick the best company.
[00:45:56] The vacant stare, the drifting of eyes from the speaker to a window or a picture or a passing
[00:46:03] blonde, though greatly tempting in the midst of long discourse are taken only as signs of
[00:46:10] inattention.
[00:46:12] Many young officer called to the carpet for some trivial business as managed to square
[00:46:17] himself with his commander just by looking straight and talking straight in the few moments
[00:46:22] that decided his future.
[00:46:24] So I guess this might be something that didn't make the politically correct version.
[00:46:27] If your eyes are wandering on a passing blonde, why do I have this conversation?
[00:46:31] So that might be one of those things where they changed that for the 2007 edition.
[00:46:37] Like what?
[00:46:38] Like that's show, show vines.
[00:46:39] It's a good show vines, stick.
[00:46:41] It's a blonde, it didn't say girl.
[00:46:43] Okay, well maybe good point, maybe it's like racial.
[00:46:47] Anti brown hair to people.
[00:46:49] Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:50] Too bad.
[00:46:53] And this is important, though.
[00:46:54] You go into talking to your in trouble.
[00:46:57] You get there, look straight and talk straight for a few minutes with the boss.
[00:47:01] Hey, this boss is what happened.
[00:47:02] This is what I did, this is mistakes I made.
[00:47:04] That's got infinitely better chance of you recovering from that situation as when you
[00:47:09] go in there.
[00:47:10] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[00:47:13] Don't be that guy.
[00:47:14] Don't be that guy.
[00:47:17] Elsewhere in the book, a great deal has been said about the importance of the voice and
[00:47:22] of developing ones, powers of conversation.
[00:47:25] Not a great deal needs to be added there, but there's no excuse for the officer who talks
[00:47:31] so that others must strain to hear what he is saying.
[00:47:35] Unless he is suffering from Laryn Jydus, it is simple enough to keep the chin up and let
[00:47:40] the words roll out.
[00:47:42] Many persons have the bad habit of letting the voice drop at the end of a sentence.
[00:47:47] The effect on the other party is like watching a man run away from a fight.
[00:47:54] Notice I said fight really loud because I didn't want to be the guy that was dropping
[00:47:57] off on the end of a sentence.
[00:47:58] Right.
[00:47:59] What about speaking and how you speak and speaking clearly and not mumbling and not fading
[00:48:05] off on the end of your words?
[00:48:08] This thing is a gold-minded book actually.
[00:48:12] This should be issued to 13 year olds nationwide in my opinion.
[00:48:16] Maybe we could start a campaign to make that happen.
[00:48:20] Good.
[00:48:21] Back to the book.
[00:48:23] Carefulness in the little things count much.
[00:48:27] And develop an aversion to the individual who cannot remember their names.
[00:48:31] Their titles or their stations.
[00:48:33] But they will warm to the person who remembers and they will overlook most of his other
[00:48:39] shortcomings.
[00:48:41] Likewise, they are won by any words of appreciation or of interest in what they're doing.
[00:48:46] So again, how we get along with other people?
[00:48:49] Remember their name.
[00:48:50] I know about it and that's hard.
[00:48:52] You know, that's hard.
[00:48:54] There's tricks for that.
[00:48:55] Yeah.
[00:48:56] See, you need tricks for it even.
[00:48:58] I mean, I'm nothing everyone needs, but I'm just saying it.
[00:49:01] It's understood that that's hard.
[00:49:03] And there's tricks out there because people know that that can be hard.
[00:49:07] And they also know that it's impactful.
[00:49:09] Yeah.
[00:49:10] It's impactful.
[00:49:11] Hammer.
[00:49:12] But you forget a guy's name literally two seconds after each of us.
[00:49:15] Unless you make it a point to command yourself to remember it.
[00:49:19] Right.
[00:49:20] That's tricky.
[00:49:21] Yeah.
[00:49:22] It's tricky.
[00:49:23] I knew a guy that was a really good leader.
[00:49:25] And he would go into a room of 25 people.
[00:49:28] And he would go over the top.
[00:49:31] And when he got done, he would say, I know all your names now.
[00:49:34] Yeah.
[00:49:35] You go name every single one of them.
[00:49:36] Yeah, Henry does that sometimes.
[00:49:37] It's pretty interesting.
[00:49:38] Yeah.
[00:49:39] That's legit.
[00:49:40] I bet Henry's got some little trick to do it.
[00:49:41] Yeah.
[00:49:42] You remember, you know, your name is Echo.
[00:49:45] Cool.
[00:49:46] I look at you and I see big E on your face.
[00:49:48] Right.
[00:49:49] Right.
[00:49:50] Now I'm amazing.
[00:49:51] Yeah.
[00:49:52] Yeah.
[00:49:53] That's interesting.
[00:49:54] I want to remember one guy.
[00:49:56] I'm going to make it a point to remember this guy's name.
[00:49:58] He'll be like, hey, my name's John.
[00:49:59] You'd be like, hey, Josh, but you'll forget it quick sometimes.
[00:50:04] It's weird, man.
[00:50:05] Not good.
[00:50:06] Got to remember those names.
[00:50:07] Got to lock them in.
[00:50:08] I think if you take a certain amount of pride in doing that,
[00:50:11] I think that helps a lot.
[00:50:12] Step number one.
[00:50:13] Yeah.
[00:50:14] Take pride in your job.
[00:50:15] Okay.
[00:50:16] I'm going to try that.
[00:50:17] Now this is interesting.
[00:50:18] A little dig here.
[00:50:20] It's actually kind of funny.
[00:50:23] He's basically going back and saying that all this information about getting along
[00:50:26] with other people.
[00:50:27] He's saying he's kind of recapping the whole thing to close it out.
[00:50:31] Back to the book.
[00:50:32] It isn't lengthy advice which is needed on this subject.
[00:50:34] Since a man commissioned is considered to have graduated from at least the kindergarten
[00:50:39] of good manners.
[00:50:41] What counts is simply caring about it and not to be ingratiating to other people,
[00:50:47] but for the sake of one's own dignity and self-respect.
[00:50:51] One of the oracles on winning friends and influencing people have said it in those
[00:50:56] few words.
[00:50:57] And if they had, there would have been no books to sell.
[00:51:01] So there's a little shot, little shot on winning friends and influencing people.
[00:51:07] Wait, when was that one right then?
[00:51:09] Oh, that was written.
[00:51:10] I don't know where the date dates, but that's written a long time ago.
[00:51:12] Dang.
[00:51:13] Yeah.
[00:51:14] Some of you have time to read that.
[00:51:15] No, that's turn of the century.
[00:51:16] Fold school.
[00:51:17] Yeah.
[00:51:18] Old school.
[00:51:20] Talking about, no, we're going to leader leaders and leadership.
[00:51:24] And what type of men are leaders?
[00:51:27] Those who come forward to fill these same places and to command them with equal or greater
[00:51:32] authority and competence will not be plastered saints.
[00:51:36] So if you remember in the beginning, he goes on this thing about how you're not going
[00:51:40] to swear and you're going to be not going to talk about women.
[00:51:43] He's given some leeway now to that.
[00:51:45] Saying they're not going to be plastered saints laden with all human virtue, spotless and
[00:51:51] character and fit to be anointed with a Superman legend by some future person weems.
[00:51:59] They will be men with a human quality and a strong belief in the United States and the goodness
[00:52:05] of a free society.
[00:52:08] They will have some of the average man's faults and maybe a few of his vices.
[00:52:14] But certainly they will possess the qualities of courage, creative intelligence and physical
[00:52:20] fitness in more than average measure.
[00:52:27] So again, it's not quite as strict as he laid out in the beginning.
[00:52:32] Yeah, because it's like, remember I'm trying, you watch training day?
[00:52:36] Remember that Denzel and I saw a part of it.
[00:52:39] Yeah, so there's a little concept is in there where he said, you got to have a
[00:52:44] little dirt on you so they can trust you.
[00:52:47] Okay.
[00:52:48] So basically, if you speak clean, well, yeah, there's all kinds of heroes that are not
[00:52:53] squeaky clean.
[00:52:54] Well, in all kinds of leaders that Denzel, I would say there's more heroes that aren't
[00:52:58] squeaky clean.
[00:52:59] Yeah, there are real purpose plenty of leaders that aren't squeaky clean and they're
[00:53:02] great leaders.
[00:53:03] Yeah.
[00:53:04] And that's what they're given that up in this book.
[00:53:06] It's saying look, not going to be a plaster saint.
[00:53:08] It'll be a person.
[00:53:09] Gonna have faults.
[00:53:10] But if we can say, gonna have vices, gonna have dirt.
[00:53:12] Yeah.
[00:53:13] For the record, the training day guys were all cropped.
[00:53:17] That's a little bit of an experience.
[00:53:19] Yeah.
[00:53:20] They had a little too much dirt.
[00:53:22] Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:23] All right, so now we're talking about Grant, General Grant, Civil War General, and
[00:53:29] beset by human failings.
[00:53:32] He could not look impressive.
[00:53:34] Average though he wasn't many things, there was nothing average about the strong
[00:53:39] way in which he took hold, applying massive common sense to the complex problems of the
[00:53:45] field.
[00:53:47] That is why he is worth close regard.
[00:53:50] His virtues as a military leader were of the simpler sort, which plain men may understand
[00:53:56] and hope to emulate.
[00:53:58] He was direct in manner.
[00:54:00] He never intrigued.
[00:54:01] His speech was homely.
[00:54:03] He was approachable.
[00:54:04] His mind never deviated from the object.
[00:54:07] Though a stubborn man, he was always willing to listen to his subordinates.
[00:54:13] And I love this one right here.
[00:54:14] He never adhered to a plan, obsnitely.
[00:54:18] But nothing could induce him to forsake the idea behind the plan.
[00:54:23] So look, I'm not going to say, here's my idea.
[00:54:25] And I'm going to hold that idea because it's good.
[00:54:27] But the plan that's going to get us there, I'm not going to have to worry about that.
[00:54:30] I'm not going to hold onto that.
[00:54:32] And let it drag me into the ground.
[00:54:35] Back to the book in the military services, though there are niches for the pad down.
[00:54:45] Character is at all times at least as vital as intellect.
[00:54:50] So padant is like overly educated types in area where you get padented, right?
[00:54:58] And the main rewards go to him who can make other men feel toughened as well as elevated.
[00:55:05] Here's some trade tier, quiet resolution.
[00:55:09] The hardyhood to take risks.
[00:55:12] The will to take full responsibility for decisions.
[00:55:18] The readiness to share its rewards with subordinates.
[00:55:22] This is obviously extreme ownership and part of extreme ownership is when you something
[00:55:26] goes well, you don't own that part.
[00:55:28] You give that away.
[00:55:31] And the key thing is to take the blame when things go adversely boom.
[00:55:38] The nerve to survive storm and disappointment and to face towards each new day with the
[00:55:45] score sheet wiped clean.
[00:55:48] Neither dwelling on one successes nor accepting discouragement from one's failures.
[00:55:56] Like I said, this book should be issued to 13 year olds.
[00:55:58] Yeah, that was a really good book.
[00:56:00] I figured you dig this one.
[00:56:05] I used a lot of highlight around this one.
[00:56:07] I've had this book for a long time.
[00:56:09] I couldn't, it's funny.
[00:56:10] When I read it this time, I hadn't read it in so long that it was almost like I was reading
[00:56:14] it again.
[00:56:15] I pretty much it forgot most of it.
[00:56:18] And a lot of it, I subconsciously, we've been probably part of my game for a long time.
[00:56:23] I can't tell, though.
[00:56:25] I can't tell what I just, what I buried and what was a seed that grew.
[00:56:31] Probably there's some ideas in here that were seeds of my thought.
[00:56:34] Yeah, I would imagine so that that's not the kind of book where it's like, oh yeah,
[00:56:37] let me memorize all this.
[00:56:39] It's more like, oh, shoot, I got it.
[00:56:40] I got it kind of in Jess.
[00:56:42] Yes, and here's the straight-up truth.
[00:56:45] When somebody gave me this book, I probably read 10 pages of it and said, oh, this is pretty
[00:56:49] cool.
[00:56:50] Put it in my locker and then went out and worked out and forgot about it for the next 15
[00:56:53] years.
[00:56:54] So it's not, I didn't, you know, this current jacco will call it where I kind of overlay
[00:57:04] and bring in, it's like a jiu-jitsu when you're going to jiu-jitsu.
[00:57:08] If you're a brown belt, I'm purple, the black belt and jiu-jitsu.
[00:57:13] Somebody can show you a move and you can assimilate it really quickly and you go, oh yeah,
[00:57:17] I need to do this.
[00:57:18] Well, I was a white belt before in this stuff.
[00:57:22] So when I'd read it, it kind of made sense, but it was, it was didn't make as much
[00:57:27] sense as that when I read this stuff now, it's like I totally understand it at a deeper
[00:57:32] level.
[00:57:33] And so it's way more impactful for me.
[00:57:41] People always ask me about this one as well, back to the book, to speak of the importance
[00:57:44] of a sense of humor would be unavailing.
[00:57:49] If it were not that what cramped so many men isn't that they are by nature humorless,
[00:57:55] but that they are hesitant to exercise what humor they possess.
[00:58:02] Within the military profession, it is as unwise to let the muscles go soft and to spare
[00:58:07] the mind, the strain of original thinking.
[00:58:11] Great humor has always been in the military tradition.
[00:58:15] People ask, for some reason people ask me about humor a lot.
[00:58:18] It's not good for an author, or it's not good for a leader to tell to.
[00:58:22] And yes, it is.
[00:58:23] And that's why I always, whenever there's something funny in the war books that we read,
[00:58:26] I always try and capture that.
[00:58:28] So then people realize that these guys are out there and they keep that sense of humor going
[00:58:32] all the time.
[00:58:33] Yeah.
[00:58:34] And I guess that doesn't really necessarily mean.
[00:58:36] Telling jokes all the time.
[00:58:37] No, just like levity.
[00:58:39] Yeah, I feel that's funny.
[00:58:41] I'm going to, you know.
[00:58:42] Yeah, yeah, just having a good time making light of these miserable situations for sure.
[00:58:47] Hmm.
[00:58:48] Said Admiral, this is going into the next chapter, which is called main springs of leadership.
[00:58:58] Said Admiral, forest, p-shermon, chief of naval operations.
[00:59:02] I concur that we can take average good men.
[00:59:07] And by proper training, developing them the essential initiative, constant confidence,
[00:59:13] and magnetism, which are necessary in leadership.
[00:59:17] I believe that these qualities are present in the average man to a degree that he can be
[00:59:22] made a good leader if his native qualities are properly developed.
[00:59:27] Whether or not he becomes a great leader depends upon whether or not he possesses that extra
[00:59:32] initiative, magnetism, moral courage and force, which makes the difference between the average
[00:59:40] man and the above average man.
[00:59:43] The general CBKates, common down to the Marine Corps, leadership is intangible, hard to
[00:59:48] measure and difficult to describe.
[00:59:51] Its qualities would seem to stem from many factors, but certainly they must include a measure
[00:59:56] of inherent ability to control and direct.
[00:59:59] Self-confidence based on expert knowledge, initiative, loyalty, pride, and sense of responsibility.
[01:00:06] Inherinability obviously cannot be instilled, but that which is latent or dormant can be
[01:00:12] developed.
[01:00:15] Other ingredients can be acquired.
[01:00:17] They are not easily taught or easily learned, but leaders can be and can be and are made.
[01:00:25] The average good man in our service is and must be considered a potential leader.
[01:00:32] So there you go to that question.
[01:00:33] It's the same answer that I give, basically all the time when people ask me if leaders
[01:00:38] are born or made, there's the answer from these two guys they agree with me or I'll
[01:00:42] say I agree with them since they're senior to me.
[01:00:45] But look, you got certain traits.
[01:00:49] You can take, I always say look, you can take someone that's an okay leader and make
[01:00:52] them a better leader.
[01:00:53] You can take a good leader and make them an outstanding leader and outstanding leader.
[01:00:56] You can make them epic leader because you can improve these things.
[01:01:00] You can learn about these things.
[01:01:02] The one person that you can't make any better is the person that's not humble.
[01:01:06] They're not going to get any better because they can't be coached because standing in his
[01:01:10] own light, because he's standing in his own light.
[01:01:12] Maybe we'll bring that back in and bring that back back to the book and before I go
[01:01:20] back to the book.
[01:01:21] This is another thing I get asked about a lot is people ask me because they know that
[01:01:25] I work a lot.
[01:01:27] They know that I get after it.
[01:01:29] Right?
[01:01:30] And they ask me about, you know, how do you, how do you do with your family?
[01:01:35] You got a family because I got four children and a wife and a goldfish.
[01:01:39] Okay.
[01:01:40] So, I sickle.
[01:01:44] That's the name.
[01:01:45] That's the name.
[01:01:46] Right?
[01:01:47] So, I got to give, you know, to the family, right?
[01:01:49] So people say, how do you, how do you balance?
[01:01:52] So here we go.
[01:01:53] Back to the book.
[01:01:54] Personal advancement within any worthwhile system requires some sacrifice of leisure and more
[01:02:01] careful attention to the better organization of ones working routine.
[01:02:08] But that does not entail heroic self-sacrifice or forfeiting of any of life's truly enduring
[01:02:16] rewards.
[01:02:18] It means putting the completion of work ahead of golf.
[01:02:23] Yeah.
[01:02:25] So, so often you see people that you're just, I'm not going to work my way.
[01:02:31] Myself to death.
[01:02:32] Okay.
[01:02:33] Are you going to play golf to death?
[01:02:34] Because that's apparently what you're trying to do here.
[01:02:36] Right?
[01:02:37] But yeah, you got to find balance.
[01:02:39] You got to find balance, especially when he's talking about life's true and enduring rewards.
[01:02:43] That's talking about your family and the things that you achieve outside of the work world.
[01:02:52] Abbey dimnet.
[01:02:53] Abbey dimnet was a priest, a priest in wrote a book called The Art of Thinking.
[01:03:04] And he's quoted here in this book.
[01:03:05] He said, concentration is supposed to be exceptional only because people do not try and
[01:03:13] in this as so many things starve within an inch of plenty.
[01:03:21] You're almost there.
[01:03:22] Almost there.
[01:03:23] Almost got plenty, but you're starting to death.
[01:03:29] Right there.
[01:03:30] We're in an inch.
[01:03:31] Why?
[01:03:32] Because you failed to concentrate.
[01:03:33] You failed to focus.
[01:03:34] And that's what happens.
[01:03:39] Oh, and well, this is just awesome.
[01:03:41] Here we go.
[01:03:42] There is, of course, that commonest of excuses for rejecting the difficult and taking life
[01:03:49] easy.
[01:03:50] I haven't time.
[01:03:53] But for the man who keeps his mind on the object, there is always time.
[01:03:59] Figure it out.
[01:04:01] About us in the service as daily, we see busy men who somehow manage to find time for whatever
[01:04:06] is worth doing.
[01:04:09] While at the adjoining desks, our others with abundant leisure who can't find time for
[01:04:15] anything.
[01:04:17] And something important requires doing is usually the busy man who gets the call.
[01:04:24] Time got time for that, huh?
[01:04:28] There's always time.
[01:04:29] Yeah.
[01:04:30] Always time.
[01:04:31] And how can you ever have time if you don't take time?
[01:04:36] That sounds cool, but I don't know what it means.
[01:04:39] Expand.
[01:04:40] Oh, who has time?
[01:04:41] Ah, but how can you ever have time if you don't take time?
[01:04:44] Oh, so you're going to take out.
[01:04:45] Okay.
[01:04:46] Okay.
[01:04:47] So, is that where it's from?
[01:04:48] The mate, like part two or something like that.
[01:04:51] Did some, there was a part two to that movie?
[01:04:53] I think there was like a part three too.
[01:04:56] Anyway, that was a good one.
[01:04:58] It's true though.
[01:04:59] You know how like, guys will be like, hey, I want to get in like really good shape or something
[01:05:04] like this.
[01:05:05] I want to get like real strong or whatever.
[01:05:06] I was like, okay.
[01:05:07] You have to work out like this.
[01:05:08] I don't have like time to both, then you don't have time then.
[01:05:12] You then you can't get in shape.
[01:05:13] It's like saying I don't have the inclination.
[01:05:16] It's more or less the same thing.
[01:05:18] I don't have the time.
[01:05:19] Yeah, I was with one of my buddies and we were counseling someone and my buddy said,
[01:05:30] you don't care about this.
[01:05:32] Then the guy says, no, no, I do care.
[01:05:36] And he said, well, why can't you show up on time?
[01:05:38] If you cared, you would show up on time.
[01:05:41] And K's closed.
[01:05:42] You're fired.
[01:05:43] That was that.
[01:05:44] I was like, well, you know what?
[01:05:45] Let's just stop talking because we're done.
[01:05:47] We're done.
[01:05:48] That's 100% accurate.
[01:05:49] So old true.
[01:05:50] So, as you probably know, I come from a long line of lately.
[01:05:54] Yes, we've discussed that before.
[01:05:56] So I kind of analyzed it.
[01:05:59] Where there was a time where I felt like,
[01:06:01] I just, I don't know.
[01:06:02] I just can't be on.
[01:06:04] It's like, it's like almost like this like a mentor physical black almost.
[01:06:07] That's what I felt like.
[01:06:08] But then.
[01:06:10] Okay.
[01:06:11] Really analyzed.
[01:06:13] When you really realized that you were just lazy.
[01:06:16] No, I'm not lazy.
[01:06:17] It wasn't important.
[01:06:18] Just like what you're saying.
[01:06:19] And this is what, so let's say work for example.
[01:06:22] I was late literally more times than I was on time.
[01:06:24] At work.
[01:06:25] I was so many times.
[01:06:26] Well, I did a good enough job.
[01:06:28] I would have fired you.
[01:06:29] And then rehired you so I could fire you.
[01:06:31] You started to take pleasure.
[01:06:32] You probably would have been a good idea.
[01:06:34] Nonetheless.
[01:06:35] So when I analyzed it, I was like,
[01:06:37] Why am I late?
[01:06:38] Why don't I get prepared the night before?
[01:06:41] Whatever it takes to be on time every single time.
[01:06:44] And just like, it's not important.
[01:06:46] Like, why would I spend my off work time preparing to go be at work?
[01:06:51] Yeah.
[01:06:52] I should be resting or that's my off time watching a little bit more television.
[01:06:57] TV or yeah, whatever.
[01:06:59] Not working.
[01:07:00] I can squeeze in another episode of this program.
[01:07:02] Exactly right.
[01:07:03] Not working.
[01:07:04] Why should I spend off work time doing work stuff?
[01:07:07] Like, I'm not getting paid or kind of thing.
[01:07:09] You know, it's not important.
[01:07:10] And that's going back to what this whole book starting off with the attitude of trying to do good job all the time.
[01:07:15] And actually somebody brought that up.
[01:07:17] It's somebody sent me a direct message.
[01:07:18] And this was a great point that I didn't think about.
[01:07:20] We got asked another question on the podcast about,
[01:07:23] Hey, if you're getting told to go to a meeting that you're not going to get paid for.
[01:07:27] Remember that conversation?
[01:07:29] This guy wrote me and said, Hey, you know, legally that that's illegal.
[01:07:32] If you're on an hourly wage, so that's a great point that I didn't think of it from a HR perspective.
[01:07:38] But that's a good point. Now you got people that you're breaking a law.
[01:07:41] So I kind of assume that these guys were not being specifically compensated,
[01:07:45] but that they were maybe salary employees that they were.
[01:07:49] But I could be wrong.
[01:07:50] And if those people are hourly, now you got to go to the boss and say, Hey, boss,
[01:07:55] I want to get this meeting going, but what you're doing to us and what you're doing to these guys is illegal.
[01:08:01] Yeah.
[01:08:02] You know, maybe the manager a lot of times managers are salaryed and the workers are hourly.
[01:08:07] So he would need to go look, I'll come to the meeting because I'm on salary. It's all good with me.
[01:08:10] I'm here to win.
[01:08:11] But the guys, I can't bring him in here unless you want to be looking at a,
[01:08:14] at a labor lawsuit, you in the game for that boss, because I'm not.
[01:08:17] That's going to cost our company money. It's going to make us look bad.
[01:08:20] Let's, let's do this another way.
[01:08:22] Yeah.
[01:08:22] Boom.
[01:08:23] But that is a different element to the whole, like the point as far as what you're talking.
[01:08:27] We're what you're talking about, like it's something like not important versus if you're in person.
[01:08:31] Like it doesn't necessarily go for just work that's why.
[01:08:34] It goes for anything, like if you're late to anything, like if you, if you, like this podcast,
[01:08:39] I'm rolling in late every single time.
[01:08:41] It's obviously because being on time is not important and that leads into this podcast.
[01:08:46] And one way or another, what we're about to do isn't important enough.
[01:08:50] That's why you're on time because it is important to you.
[01:08:53] There you go.
[01:08:54] Boom.
[01:08:55] Because it's important to me to you.
[01:08:56] And I will spend off my quote and quote free time doing stuff to prepare for, you know, the on time.
[01:09:03] It's stuff.
[01:09:04] We're got it's good.
[01:09:05] And you seem to say otherwise you'd be getting fired.
[01:09:07] I'm just using this as a hype.
[01:09:09] Give me another echo Charles.
[01:09:11] You're going to throw the right one.
[01:09:13] You don't even know the difference.
[01:09:15] Yeah.
[01:09:16] Good.
[01:09:17] Although he probably genetically has the same problem.
[01:09:18] Yeah.
[01:09:19] I told you we come from a long line.
[01:09:21] Now he knows the importance of, you know.
[01:09:24] And it's a, and it's a sign of disrespect, too, by the way.
[01:09:27] Yes.
[01:09:28] It's like saying not only do I not think what we're, what we've planned to do or agreed to do.
[01:09:32] And all this time stuff.
[01:09:33] Not only do I not think that's important.
[01:09:36] I don't respect how much you think it's important.
[01:09:39] That's what we respect my time.
[01:09:41] Nope.
[01:09:42] Not at all.
[01:09:43] Not at all.
[01:09:44] The on time.
[01:09:45] Well.
[01:09:46] And make time.
[01:09:47] Take time.
[01:09:48] If, yeah, if you want to have time, you got to take care.
[01:09:53] Yeah.
[01:09:54] And that's what's so like about this guy's actually making fun of people that say I haven't got time.
[01:10:00] Because for the man who keeps his mind on the object there is always time.
[01:10:09] Next section says, much is conveyed in, in few words, in Army field forces brief on practical
[01:10:16] concepts of leadership.
[01:10:18] It is stressed therein that the preeminent quality, which all great commanders have owned
[01:10:25] common is a posiveness of manner and viewpoint.
[01:10:31] The power to concentrate on means to a given end to the exclusion of exaggerated fears of the
[01:10:39] obstacles which lie afroarch the course.
[01:10:45] Every word of that should be underscored.
[01:10:47] And above all, what it says about the need for affirmative thinking and concentrating on how things
[01:10:53] can be done.
[01:10:54] This is the part.
[01:10:55] You always hear about this.
[01:10:56] You always hear about this person.
[01:10:58] The person that says, when you go to them and say, hey, can we do this?
[01:11:02] They're always looking for a way to say no.
[01:11:04] A reason why something can happen instead of, no, we can do that.
[01:11:08] We can make that happen.
[01:11:09] We can figure out a way.
[01:11:10] That's what we're looking for.
[01:11:14] Next section.
[01:11:16] Those in this section is actually the same topic of what this podcast is the topic of and
[01:11:25] that is human nature.
[01:11:29] Those who had the chance to study American men under the terrible rigor of Japanese and
[01:11:33] prison during World War II gave an analysis that in certain of the prisoners, character
[01:11:41] insanity with it, held fast against every circumstance.
[01:11:47] In others, some of whom had been well educated and came from gentle homes, the brute instinct
[01:11:53] was as uppermost as in an east African cannibal.
[01:12:00] And when they say brute instinct, that's the person that just loses and goes to the animal
[01:12:04] instincts.
[01:12:07] Some such crucibles as these even more than from the remittance stresses of combat and war
[01:12:14] comes the clearest light on the inner nature of man in so far as it needs to be understood
[01:12:19] by the officer who may someday lead a force into battle.
[01:12:25] Human nature.
[01:12:33] One of the things that he says about human nature in here is good will and weakness, maybe
[01:12:39] combined in one man, bad will and strength in another.
[01:12:44] High moral leading can lift the first man to excel himself.
[01:12:49] It will not reform the other.
[01:12:52] But there is no other sensible rule, then that all men will be approached with trust and
[01:12:59] treated his trust trustworthy until proved otherwise beyond reasonable doubt.
[01:13:06] So he's thrown out the trust.
[01:13:08] He's a little bit of an option.
[01:13:09] I've talked about it.
[01:13:10] I actually, I should take that back.
[01:13:13] Remember one time on the podcast, I said, look, I don't have a high expectation of people
[01:13:17] when I meet him.
[01:13:18] And I hold that true to this day.
[01:13:21] But I don't straight up not trust them as a human.
[01:13:24] Yeah.
[01:13:25] There's a difference there.
[01:13:26] I think there's a difference.
[01:13:27] I think I feel that way.
[01:13:28] There is a, yeah, and it's not an obvious difference, but it's like the difference between
[01:13:32] I don't have an high expectation of somebody.
[01:13:35] And versus I have a low expectation of person.
[01:13:37] Got it.
[01:13:38] Somebody.
[01:13:39] So it does sound the same.
[01:13:41] It sounds the same.
[01:13:42] It's not an expectation than what kind of expectation do you have?
[01:13:45] No.
[01:13:46] No.
[01:13:47] Maybe just a neutral one.
[01:13:48] Right.
[01:13:49] Like I'm not going to put any expectations.
[01:13:51] I'm not expecting you to do a bunch of hero, I don't have any expectations.
[01:13:56] Just neutral.
[01:13:57] I come in with a neutral attitude on that one.
[01:14:00] Yeah.
[01:14:01] Back to the book, Men do not achieve a great solidarity or preserve it simply by being
[01:14:06] together.
[01:14:08] Their mutual bonds are forged only by doing together, that which they have been convinced
[01:14:14] is constructive.
[01:14:17] The absence of a common purpose is the chief source of unhappiness in any collection
[01:14:23] of individuals.
[01:14:25] Talking it and the common standard of justice, which is one of its chief agents, men become
[01:14:32] more and more separate units, each fighting for his own rights.
[01:14:39] This is why you got to have that common purpose.
[01:14:41] This is why that commander's intent is so important.
[01:14:43] This is why it's important that everyone understands why they're doing what they're doing.
[01:14:47] They have to understand the strategic goal that you're trying to meet as a company, as
[01:14:51] a business, as a team, as a platoon.
[01:14:55] And that's a person and like a lot of people, they go into straight up depression.
[01:15:00] Because I mean, if they don't see the big goal, if they don't see a purpose in their
[01:15:03] life, that is true.
[01:15:08] Back to the book, whatever his rank, it is impossible for any man to lead if he is himself
[01:15:18] running behind.
[01:15:21] This bespeaks the need of constant study, the constant use of one's personal powers and
[01:15:26] the exercise of the imagination.
[01:15:30] As men advance, that which was good soon ceases to be good simply because something
[01:15:36] better is possible.
[01:15:37] You got to evolve.
[01:15:40] You got to continue to evolve, you got to continue to improve yourself.
[01:15:45] History confirms, and a study of the workings of the human mind supports one proposition
[01:15:51] which many of the great captains of war have accepted as a truism.
[01:15:57] There are no bad troops.
[01:15:59] There are only bad leaders.
[01:16:03] Yeah.
[01:16:05] Interesting.
[01:16:06] It's here Napoleon said, Napoleon said there's no bad kernels, only bad regiments.
[01:16:11] Hackworth said the same thing.
[01:16:14] No bad team.
[01:16:15] I think he said no bad troops, only bad officers in the book that Laefan, I wrote, no bad
[01:16:20] teams, only bad leaders.
[01:16:21] So very common and very true stands the test of time.
[01:16:30] You know, there's a reason why Napoleon fought that.
[01:16:34] There's a reason why SLA Marshall said that.
[01:16:37] There's a reason why Hackworth said that.
[01:16:39] There's a reason why Laefan, I put that in the book.
[01:16:41] Because that is true.
[01:16:42] In the minute you, if you're in a leadership position, the minute that you accept that fact
[01:16:47] is the minute you step forward as becoming a better leader.
[01:16:50] Because as soon as you're blaming it on other people, you're just not going to make
[01:16:53] it bad.
[01:16:54] Oh my team sucks.
[01:16:55] You suck.
[01:16:56] Right.
[01:16:57] So it's lit.
[01:16:58] I don't know if you call this irony or what, but no bad team is only bad leaders.
[01:17:03] So if you're like, wait, that's not true.
[01:17:05] Oh, guess what?
[01:17:06] You're bad leader.
[01:17:07] Yeah.
[01:17:08] It's a good ticket catch 22.
[01:17:11] Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:12] What's good for the goose is good for the, again, actually, I don't think that's it.
[01:17:17] Alright, this is awesome.
[01:17:19] Here we go, back to the book.
[01:17:21] And this, actually, this section here has gone to group nature.
[01:17:26] So you've gone from human nature to group nature.
[01:17:29] Back to the book, among the commonest of experiences in war is to witness troops doing
[01:17:36] nothing or worse doing the wrong thing without one commanding voice being raised to give
[01:17:43] them direction.
[01:17:45] Such circumstance any man who has the nerve and presence to step forward and give them an
[01:17:52] intelligent order in a manner indicating that he expects to be obeyed will be accepted
[01:17:59] as a leader and will be given their support.
[01:18:02] Did you hear that?
[01:18:04] That's all it is.
[01:18:05] Who's going to step up?
[01:18:06] Who's going to have the nerve and the presence to step up and give an intelligent
[01:18:10] order that you believe in and that you believe will be followed on?
[01:18:14] I did you expect to be obeyed, you'll be obeyed.
[01:18:17] So again, I hear all these people say, well, you know, the senior position, therefore
[01:18:21] I can't do anything wrong.
[01:18:22] Actually, you can.
[01:18:24] Step up and lead.
[01:18:28] Back to the book for this reason, under the conditions of modern battle, the coherence of any
[01:18:32] military body comes not only of men being articulate all down the line, but of building
[01:18:40] up the dynamic power in each individual.
[01:18:45] It is a thoroughly sound exercise in any unit to give every man a chance to take charge
[01:18:50] and give orders in drill or other limited exercises once he has learned what the orders
[01:18:55] mean.
[01:18:57] By the same token, it is good practice for the junior leader to displace a file.
[01:19:03] That means just one of the guys to displace a file in a training exercise and become
[01:19:08] commanded for a time to sharpen his own perspective.
[01:19:13] So it's good for the junior guys to step up into leadership positions and lead.
[01:19:20] It's good for the leaders to go and be one of the boys in the cartoon.
[01:19:23] I got really lucky because I was a prior, I'm a prior and listed guy, I'm a mustang
[01:19:28] officer.
[01:19:29] So I spent my first eight years in the suit teams as a guy in the, I was one of the
[01:19:33] files.
[01:19:34] So I knew what it was like when a leader didn't tell you what was going on, I knew
[01:19:38] what it was like when you had a good leader.
[01:19:41] So when I stepped up into those leadership positions, I knew at least what not to do.
[01:19:46] And I knew what I would try and do to be a good leader.
[01:19:48] It's like the curse of knowledge.
[01:19:51] Like you don't curse the knowledge just when you can't see it from some inexperienced
[01:19:55] person's point of view.
[01:19:57] And so you don't really have that.
[01:20:00] Because you've been the inexperienced.
[01:20:01] You can just draw on those memories.
[01:20:02] You know, I have that perspective that full I know what is nice to do.
[01:20:05] I don't want to worst things in your at the end of a 16 man seal, put you in patrolling
[01:20:10] through the night and you just have no idea where you are.
[01:20:12] You have no idea how far the target is away.
[01:20:14] You have no idea when you're going to stop.
[01:20:15] You have no idea of anything.
[01:20:16] You're just rocking like a miserable boots, boots, boots.
[01:20:23] That's what you're getting the zone of.
[01:20:26] It's just the worst.
[01:20:27] So when I was a platoon commander, I was a squad leader.
[01:20:30] But I tried with everything I had to make sure everyone knew what's going on all the time.
[01:20:36] Because I never wanted my guys to be thinking, what is happening?
[01:20:38] What are we doing?
[01:20:39] Yeah, that's good.
[01:20:45] Progress comes of making the most of our strengths rather than looking for ways to repair
[01:20:49] weaknesses.
[01:20:51] This is true in things both large and small.
[01:20:54] The platoon leader who permits himself to be be deviled by the file who won't or can't
[01:20:59] keep step cannot do justice to the ambitions of the 10 strongest men beneath him.
[01:21:05] Upon whom the life of the formation would depend common emergency.
[01:21:11] To nourish and encourage the top rather than to concentrate effort and exhaust nerves and
[01:21:16] trying to correct a few least likely prospects is the healthy way of growth within military
[01:21:22] organization.
[01:21:24] Take care of your top people, put your photo, focus and energy them.
[01:21:27] And I was going to give some time to the guys that are struggling, trying to help them
[01:21:30] out.
[01:21:31] But let's not focus on them.
[01:21:33] They're not going to make a break you.
[01:21:35] So it's leaders that you want to develop.
[01:21:37] You got a good seed that's starting to grow.
[01:21:40] Water that seed.
[01:21:42] Don't worry about that thing over there in the corner.
[01:21:44] That's not doing anything.
[01:21:49] It is a good, this is classic.
[01:21:51] It is a sign of a good level of discipline in command when orders are given and faithfully
[01:21:58] carried out.
[01:22:00] But it is a sign of a vastly superior condition when the men are prepared to demand those
[01:22:07] orders which they know the situation requires if it is to be helped.
[01:22:12] No competent subordinate sits around waiting for someone else to give impulse to movement
[01:22:17] if he senses if his senses tell him that things are going to pot.
[01:22:21] Either suggest a course of action to his superior or ask authority to execute it on his
[01:22:27] own or in the more desperate circumstances of the battlefield gives orders on his own initiative.
[01:22:36] Descentualized command.
[01:22:38] Everybody's a leader.
[01:22:39] Everybody steps up and makes things happen.
[01:22:44] Back to the book, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was thinking on these things when he said
[01:22:48] during World War II.
[01:22:49] There is among the massive individuals who carry rifles in war, a great amount of ingenuity
[01:22:55] and efficiency.
[01:22:57] If men can talk naturally to their officers, the product of their resourcefulness becomes
[01:23:02] available to all.
[01:23:06] So as long as you can, as long as you're guys feel comfortable talking to you, you're
[01:23:09] going to have access to all their ideas and all their ingenuity back to the book, but
[01:23:14] the art of open communication requires both receiving and ending and the besetting
[01:23:20] problems to get officers to talk naturally to men.
[01:23:26] Develop the relationships with the troops is what you got to do.
[01:23:30] Another section here at all training, all training at all levels has a dual object to
[01:23:39] develop us all as leaders of men and as followers of leaders.
[01:23:45] dichotomy.
[01:23:46] Got to be a leader.
[01:23:47] Got to be a follower.
[01:23:48] It's like your Twitter thing.
[01:23:50] You're Twitter by a leader follower.
[01:23:53] Oh, beaker listener.
[01:23:54] Let it dichotomy.
[01:23:55] Right, or reader?
[01:23:56] Right, or reader, yeah.
[01:23:57] Exactly.
[01:23:58] That is, that is, there's a dichotomy there.
[01:24:02] To the book, the paralysis which comes of fear can be lifted only through the resumption
[01:24:09] of action, which will again give individuals the feeling of organization.
[01:24:14] So this is interesting.
[01:24:15] We remember that Joe Owen, when he was in Korea, in the coldest war, in colder than hell,
[01:24:26] he's freezing.
[01:24:28] And there's shooting starts.
[01:24:29] And he's got his own procedure of how he's going to overcome the fear.
[01:24:32] He's going to do, he's going to take action.
[01:24:33] And it's something that I've said on here a bunch of times here.
[01:24:35] You're afraid of something?
[01:24:36] Take action.
[01:24:37] Step into it.
[01:24:38] So what this is saying is the same thing, but not on an individual level, but on a group
[01:24:43] level.
[01:24:44] Because we're talking about group nature here.
[01:24:45] And it's the same thing as you do with an individual.
[01:24:48] You do it the group.
[01:24:49] So listen to this again.
[01:24:50] The paralysis, which comes of fear, can be lifted only through the resumption of action, which
[01:24:56] will again give the individuals feeling of organization.
[01:25:01] This does not mean ordering a bayonet charge or firing a volley at such and such a clock.
[01:25:06] It may mean only padding one man on the back, talking it up to a couple of others, sending
[01:25:12] someone out to find a flank or turning one's self to dig in, while passing the word
[01:25:19] to others to do likewise.
[01:25:22] This is action in the realist sense of the term.
[01:25:27] Re-invigorating men toward the faking of many small actions develops the possibility
[01:25:34] of large and decisive action.
[01:25:37] The unit must first find itself before doing an effective job of finding the enemy out
[01:25:44] of those acts, which are incidental to the establishing of an order, the leader reaffirms
[01:25:51] his own power of decision.
[01:25:53] So those are beautiful advice.
[01:25:56] Just like you do with yourself, you're afraid of something, take action, step into it.
[01:26:00] You got your group and everyone started to get scared and overwhelmed.
[01:26:03] Let's take some action.
[01:26:04] Hey guys, dig in.
[01:26:05] Hey guys, online.
[01:26:07] Whatever that order is going to be, that's that for it may not solve the problem, but it
[01:26:11] regains your stability as a team.
[01:26:16] Now you can move forward.
[01:26:23] This next section is subtitled environment.
[01:26:29] Back to the book, it is only to the man who is burned with unnecessary and exaggerated
[01:26:34] fear, fears, and who mistakes for fancy security, the privilege of sitting quietly in one
[01:26:42] place that the uprooting which comes with war is demoralizing.
[01:26:50] The natural officer sees it as an hour of opportunity.
[01:26:55] And though he may not like anything else about war, he at least relishes the strong feeling
[01:27:01] of personal contention which always develop develops when there are many openings inviting
[01:27:08] many men.
[01:27:10] As a world war to commander expressed it, during war, the ball is always kicking around
[01:27:17] loose in the middle of the field and any man who has the will may pick it up and run
[01:27:25] with it.
[01:27:30] That's true by life so many opportunities out there who's going to pick it up and run
[01:27:35] with it becomes the question.
[01:27:39] Now we get into touching back a little bit onto some discipline.
[01:27:45] Back to the book, when men are given absolute freedom, with no compulsion upon them but
[01:27:51] to eat and sleep as with a group of South Sea savages, there can be no strong uniting
[01:27:59] bond between them.
[01:28:06] Absolute freedom doesn't get you what you want.
[01:28:08] There's got to be a counter to that and that counter is discipline.
[01:28:11] I suppose that's another politically incorrect thing that we've run into the book a couple
[01:28:15] times the South Sea savages.
[01:28:19] Who's the technically probably natives from the South Sea?
[01:28:23] Oh, yes.
[01:28:24] In fact, that is who it is.
[01:28:27] Okay, all right, there you go.
[01:28:29] No offense intended.
[01:28:34] Back to the book, in officership there is simply no substitute for personal reconnaissance.
[01:28:39] Do or any other technique that in the long run will have half its value.
[01:28:44] So when he's talking about personal reconnaissance here, he's not talking about going to
[01:28:47] reconniscence of an enemy position.
[01:28:50] He's talking about going down and reconnaissance doing reconnaissance within your own element,
[01:28:58] talking to your people.
[01:28:59] What he's talking about here.
[01:29:01] He's talking about that habit of personal reconnaissance.
[01:29:04] Once formed, the habit of getting down to the roots of organization, of seeing with
[01:29:11] one's own eyes what is taking place, of measuring it against one's own scale of values,
[01:29:17] of ordering such changes as our needed and of following through to make certain that
[01:29:22] the changes are made becomes the main spring of all efficient command action.
[01:29:28] In battle, there is no other way to be sure.
[01:29:32] In training, there is no better way to move towards self assurance.
[01:29:38] So get down there, get in the weed, sometimes see what's going on in the front lines, talk
[01:29:43] to your people.
[01:29:50] This section talks about the mission.
[01:29:52] When an order is given, what are the responsibilities of the man who receives it?
[01:29:57] In sequence, these, to be certain that he understands what is required, to examine and
[01:30:03] organize his resources as promptly as possible, to inform his subordinates upon these points,
[01:30:10] to execute the order without waste of time or means, to call for support if events prove
[01:30:17] that his means are inadequate, to fill up the spaces in the orders if there are developments
[01:30:23] which had not been anticipated.
[01:30:26] When the detail is complete, to prepare to go on to something else.
[01:30:32] Straight forward, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Morgan, who planned the invasion of Normandy,
[01:30:37] put the matter this way, when setting out on any enterprise.
[01:30:42] It is well, it is as well to ask oneself three questions.
[01:30:46] To whom is one responsible?
[01:30:49] For what precisely is one responsible, what are the means that disposable at disposal
[01:30:55] for discharging this responsibility?
[01:30:58] Nothing so warms the heart of a superior.
[01:31:01] As that, on giving an order, he sees his subordinates salute and say, yes, sir, then about
[01:31:08] face and proceed to carry it out to the hilt without faltering or looking back.
[01:31:15] This is the kind of a man that a commander will choose to have with him every time and that
[01:31:20] he will recommend for first advancement.
[01:31:24] On the other hand, clarification of the object is not only a right but a duty and it cuts
[01:31:30] both ways.
[01:31:32] So if you don't understand, you have the duty to ask for clarification.
[01:31:38] Orders are not always clear and no superior is on firm ground when he is inpatient of questions
[01:31:44] which are to the point or resentful of the man who asks him.
[01:31:48] I say this all the time.
[01:31:50] If your subordinates say, why are we doing this and you get angry, you're wrong.
[01:31:54] You should be happy that your subordinates ask him why.
[01:31:58] But it is natural that he will be doubtful of the man who's words show either that he
[01:32:03] hasn't heard or is concerned mainly with the relevancies.
[01:32:08] The cultivation of the habit of careful, concentrated listening and of collected thought
[01:32:15] and reading into any problem is principle, portal to successful officership.
[01:32:24] From the pen of general, Eisenhower comes these words.
[01:32:28] The commander's success will be measured more by his ability to lead than by his adherence
[01:32:35] to fixed notions.
[01:32:39] Thus, in the conduct of operations not less than in the execution of orders, it is necessary
[01:32:46] that the mind remain plastic and impressionable.
[01:32:51] Again, the idea of the military man is this person that can't change and is close-minded.
[01:32:57] It's wrong.
[01:32:58] Now there are military leaders like that.
[01:33:01] And it's unfortunate.
[01:33:02] They're not good.
[01:33:03] You got to have the flexible mind.
[01:33:06] You got to have the plastic mind.
[01:33:07] Obedience is not the product of fear, but of understanding and understanding is based
[01:33:14] on knowledge.
[01:33:15] So you got to make sure that your troops understand what's going on.
[01:33:17] So they know what's going on.
[01:33:18] So they can obey properly, not out of fear.
[01:33:25] To grasp the spirit of orders is not less important than to accept them cheerfully and
[01:33:32] keep faith with the contract.
[01:33:36] But the letter of an instruction does not relieve him who receives it from the obligation
[01:33:41] to exercise common sense.
[01:33:45] You get told to do something you still got to do.
[01:33:46] You still got to hold common sense.
[01:33:48] In the Carolina Manuvers of 1941, a soldier stood at a road intersection for three days
[01:33:54] and nights directing civilian traffic simply because the man who put him there had
[01:33:58] forgotten all about it.
[01:34:00] Though he was praised at the time, he was hardly a shining example of the hold up to
[01:34:05] the troops moving into the next chapter, which the name of the chapter is discipline.
[01:34:22] This is, you're going to recognize this one.
[01:34:25] Once a man condones remisses his own belief in discipline begins to wither.
[01:34:32] The officer who tolerate slackness in the dress of his men soon ceases to tend his own
[01:34:39] appearance.
[01:34:41] And if he is not called to account, his sloppy habits will shortly begin to inflict
[01:34:45] his superior.
[01:34:48] There's only one correct way to wear the uniform.
[01:34:50] When any deviations and dress are condoned within the services, the way is open to the
[01:34:55] destruction of all uniformity and unity.
[01:34:59] It's not what you preach.
[01:35:03] You condoned remisses.
[01:35:07] You're opening.
[01:35:08] Now, this might be a little bit extreme.
[01:35:11] When he says that when you're out of uniform, you allow these units of the way is open
[01:35:15] to the destruction of all uniformity and unity.
[01:35:18] I'm not sure I 100% agree with that.
[01:35:20] And I was always very pro uniform and making sure that guys were square to wear in their
[01:35:25] uniforms.
[01:35:26] With the most stringent in the seal teams, in the seal teams, is not uniforms are not real
[01:35:34] good at wearing uniforms and looking good uniforms and being square to wear uniforms.
[01:35:38] So it's kind of hard for me to agree that that opens up the way for the destruction of all
[01:35:42] uniformity.
[01:35:43] But the lesson here is more about the uniforms.
[01:35:48] It's more about just, it's not what you preach.
[01:35:51] It's what you dollar it.
[01:35:52] Yeah, that's slippery slope situation.
[01:35:54] Yes, it is.
[01:35:55] Well, opening the ways it necessarily ensuring something true.
[01:36:00] True.
[01:36:01] True.
[01:36:02] I'll give it to you.
[01:36:04] You get me on the technicality sometimes, that's fine.
[01:36:06] Okay, with that, I'm plastic in my mind.
[01:36:09] I can accept that plastic, you know, some people say plastic like, oh, that guys,
[01:36:14] but plastic, meaning like he's fake or something like that.
[01:36:16] Oh, yeah.
[01:36:17] This is for like plasticity.
[01:36:18] Yes, absolutely.
[01:36:20] In the 1950 before plastic was everything that we used.
[01:36:26] I used to have this theory that anything that was made of metal was better.
[01:36:31] It just made everything of metal.
[01:36:32] I wanted to make everything that was made metal.
[01:36:34] Right.
[01:36:35] Don't they say stuff?
[01:36:36] That's the same thing about like food and bacon.
[01:36:39] Like anything bacon is better.
[01:36:40] Similar.
[01:36:41] Similar.
[01:36:42] It would be correct.
[01:36:43] Yeah.
[01:36:44] It can's good.
[01:36:45] Yeah.
[01:36:47] Back to the book.
[01:36:48] No leader ever fails his men.
[01:36:49] No, they fail him who leads them in respect for the discipline of life.
[01:36:55] Between these two things, discipline in itself and a personal faith in the military value
[01:37:01] of discipline lies all the difference between military maturity and mediocrity.
[01:37:08] A salute from an unwilling man is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a tree.
[01:37:16] It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by a gust of wind.
[01:37:21] But a salute from the man who takes pride in the gesture because he feels privileged
[01:37:25] to wear the uniform of the United States having found the service good is the epitome
[01:37:30] of military virtue.
[01:37:39] Until man are severely tried, there is no conclusive test of their discipline nor proof.
[01:37:46] That their training at arms is satisfying a legitimate military end.
[01:37:54] Military forces remain relatively undisciplined until physically toughened and mentally
[01:37:58] conditioned to unusual exertion.
[01:38:01] Consider the road march.
[01:38:04] No body of men could possibly enjoy the dust, the heat, the blistered foot and the aching
[01:38:11] back, but a hard road marching is necessary if a sound foundation is to be built under
[01:38:17] the discipline of fighting forces, particularly those whose labors are in the field.
[01:38:25] And the gain comes quickly.
[01:38:27] The rise in spirits within any organization which is always to be observed after they
[01:38:32] rebound from a hard march does not come essentially from the feeling of relief that the
[01:38:37] strain is passed but rather from the satisfaction that a goal has been crossed.
[01:38:46] It must be accepted that discipline does not break down under the strain of placing a
[01:38:51] testing demand upon the individual.
[01:38:54] It is slough and not activity that destroys discipline.
[01:39:00] Think about that one.
[01:39:03] Although it is not the strain, it is not the pressure that you put that breaks down the
[01:39:07] discipline, it is the laziness, it is the slough that breaks discipline.
[01:39:11] Troops can endure hard going when it serves an understandable end.
[01:39:17] This is what they will boast about.
[01:39:19] Mainly when the fatigue is ended, a large part of training is necessarily directed toward
[01:39:23] conditioning them for unusual hardship and privation.
[01:39:28] They can take it and stride, but no power on earth can reconcile them to what common sense
[01:39:33] tells them is unnecessary hardship which might have been avoided by greater intelligence
[01:39:37] in their superiors.
[01:39:40] If you are telling people to do something, they realize that there is an easier way to do
[01:39:43] it.
[01:39:45] They are going to be angry when they are overloaded, they know it.
[01:39:50] When they are required to form a parade two hours ahead of time because their commander got
[01:39:55] over anxious or didn't know how to write an order, again, they know it.
[01:40:00] They are perfectly right if they go sour because this kind of thing happens a little too
[01:40:04] often within the command.
[01:40:09] Within our system, that discipline is nearest perfect which assures to the individual, the
[01:40:17] greatest freedom of thought and action.
[01:40:22] While at all times promoting his feeling of responsibility toward the group, the red,
[01:40:29] do you hear about the greatest form of discipline is the one that gives the greatest freedom
[01:40:35] of thought and action?
[01:40:36] That's what we want.
[01:40:37] We want the discipline to equal freedom.
[01:40:44] That's interesting his take on like when you go through some hard stuff, the satisfaction
[01:40:50] isn't that it's over.
[01:40:51] It's the fact that you did that absolutely.
[01:40:54] Yeah, it's like, you know, I told you, it might hold sleep.
[01:40:58] I mean, we'll use to be it worth if I didn't get my half hours done for the day.
[01:41:03] But so now let's say I get two hours sleep.
[01:41:07] And I'm like, hey, I'm gonna still do this work.
[01:41:10] I would do whatever this condition is something hard.
[01:41:13] Sure, it's gonna be hard.
[01:41:14] Sure, I'm not looking forward to it.
[01:41:15] But yeah, the satisfaction is afterwards all you can go to, how it's at it, you're gonna
[01:41:19] have something to brag about.
[01:41:20] If there's something like that, that's true.
[01:41:22] You go and tell your friends, hey, I did this way only to hours sleep.
[01:41:26] Got it.
[01:41:27] Yeah, you do kind of have that feeling like you want to brag about it.
[01:41:30] No doubt.
[01:41:31] Like I did some hard stuff.
[01:41:32] You know, we shouldn't be surprised.
[01:41:35] We're kind of getting excited when these things completely make sense.
[01:41:39] These are, these are generals that knew and understand human nature.
[01:41:46] And these are things that we look at and we learn and we've experienced.
[01:41:50] So it shouldn't come as a surprise.
[01:41:52] Yeah, I know.
[01:41:53] It's crazy.
[01:41:54] It's like tunnel vision, you know, where it'll happen and you almost like you don't
[01:41:58] even realize it'll happen.
[01:41:59] Everyone does that.
[01:42:00] Everyone does something for hard.
[01:42:01] For sure.
[01:42:02] Get through hard work day, did something under these circumstances.
[01:42:04] That they hate.
[01:42:05] They might even be complaining about it.
[01:42:07] Like, oh, this was going on so such a stressful day.
[01:42:10] But when you get it actually done, you brag about it.
[01:42:13] At the very least, you feel like you want to brag about it.
[01:42:16] And keep that good person that, you know, keep that up.
[01:42:21] Now there's some counter to that.
[01:42:22] Here we go.
[01:42:23] Back to the book, if the man is cramped by monotonous routine or made to feel that he
[01:42:29] cannot move unless an order is barked, he cannot develop these qualities and he will never
[01:42:34] come forward as a junior leader.
[01:42:36] So if you put too much discipline on somebody, they're going to your crept their leadership
[01:42:40] up capabilities.
[01:42:41] Say that all the time.
[01:42:45] In the words of dupeque, who saw so deeply into the hearts of fighting men, if one does
[01:42:50] not wish bonds broken, one should make them elastic and thereby strengthen them.
[01:43:00] That's a guy.
[01:43:02] He wrote a thing called the battle studies.
[01:43:05] Well, actually, he didn't finish writing it because he got killed in action, fighting
[01:43:11] fighting.
[01:43:14] Napoleon, he was French, fighting again in the, say fighting the Russians.
[01:43:20] But yet another great quote from him that I wrote down, nothing can be, nothing can wisely
[01:43:28] be prescribed in any army without exact knowledge of the fundamental instrument of man
[01:43:36] and the state of mind, his morale at the instant of combat.
[01:43:42] So to peak is a guy that really started looking at the mentality of guys.
[01:43:48] We might have to get it.
[01:43:52] We might have to dive into him at some point.
[01:43:55] Now, speaking of morale, the next section is about morale.
[01:44:00] A word war to blue jacket said it this way.
[01:44:03] Blue jacket's turn for Navy guys said it this way.
[01:44:07] Morales when your hands and feet keep working when your head says it can't be done.
[01:44:13] The handiest beginning is to consider morale and conjunction with discipline.
[01:44:18] Since in military service, their opposite sides of the same coin, when one is present,
[01:44:23] the other will also be there.
[01:44:28] Moral and discipline.
[01:44:30] Moral and discipline, they go together.
[01:44:34] This is a familiar story.
[01:44:35] It was repeated by the United States forces in World War II during the Normandy had
[01:44:39] road fighting and the invasions of the Central Pacific atolls.
[01:44:44] Troops had to learn the hard way how to hit, how to survive, in moving through jungle
[01:44:49] or cross mountains in the desert.
[01:44:52] When that happened, the only disciplinary residue which mattered was obedience to orders.
[01:44:58] The movements they had learned by rope were of less value than the spiritual bond between
[01:45:05] one man and another.
[01:45:08] The most valuable lesson was that of mutual support.
[01:45:12] So, this is awesome.
[01:45:15] The moves, the battle moves that they learned, that they trained, that were hard and put
[01:45:19] them through this hard, getting ready to deploy overseas.
[01:45:22] When they got overseas, they were fighting in a hedger, they never did that before, they're
[01:45:24] fighting in a mountain, they never did that before.
[01:45:26] So they had to take these drills that they had learned and kind of throw them out the window.
[01:45:30] So all they had left and the most valuable thing of all that training wasn't to move
[01:45:35] in themselves, it was the spiritual bond between these men.
[01:45:40] That was more important than the tactical maneuvers, was the fact that they did hard training
[01:45:43] together and they worked together and they knew each other and had that spiritual bond.
[01:45:49] Back to the book, in its essentials discipline is not measured according to how a man
[01:45:54] keeps step in a drill yard or whether he salutes it just the right angle.
[01:46:00] The test is how well he willingly responds to his superior in all vital matters and finally,
[01:46:07] whether he stands or runs when his life is at stake.
[01:46:12] History makes this clear, there are countless examples of successful military forces
[01:46:17] which had almost no discipline when measured by the usual yard sticks.
[01:46:23] It had a high battle morale, productive of the kind of discipline which beats the enemy in battle.
[01:46:31] So that's another little dichotomy, you know, they've talked about it.
[01:46:33] You might not be the most disciplined on the parade field, but if you've got that bond
[01:46:38] and you've got that discipline bond, you can still come up with the victory.
[01:46:44] This is important.
[01:46:46] Back to the book, man is able to recognize a right and reasonable discipline as such, even though
[01:46:52] it causes him personal inconvenience because he's acquired a sense of military values.
[01:46:59] But if it is either unduly harsh or unnecessarily lacks, he likewise knows it and
[01:47:10] wears it as a hair shirt to the undoing of his morale.
[01:47:16] So the man, like the group, can be hurt by being pushed beyond sensible limits, his spirit
[01:47:23] will suffer even more sorely.
[01:47:25] If no real test is put upon his abilities and moral powers.
[01:47:30] The greater his intelligence, the stronger will be his resentment.
[01:47:35] That is the law of nature.
[01:47:37] The enlightened mind has always the greatest measure of self-discipline, but it also has
[01:47:43] a higher sense of what constitutes justice, fair play and a reasonable requirement in the
[01:47:49] performance of duty.
[01:47:52] If denied these things, he will come to hold his chief, his job and himself in contempt.
[01:48:02] So if you get the if you're a military leader or if you're a civilian leader and you get
[01:48:05] the idea, okay, Jockel, talking about discipline, discipline's key, so you're going to come
[01:48:08] in and just throw discipline on your people and burden them with this heavy realm of discipline,
[01:48:14] it's not going to work out because everyone knows that it's unjust unfair.
[01:48:19] Unnecessary.
[01:48:21] We don't want that unnecessary discipline, but we embrace women.
[01:48:25] I will believe that we deep inside, we embrace the hardcore discipline if it makes sense
[01:48:29] and has meaning.
[01:48:36] Admiral Ben Moril has stated a formula in understanding terms by his explanation of what
[01:48:41] made the CB's notable for competence and devotion to duty during World War II.
[01:48:46] What he said is this, we used artisans to do the work for which they had been trained in civilian
[01:48:51] life.
[01:48:53] They were well led by officers who spoke their language.
[01:48:56] We made them feel that they were playing an important part in a great adventure and thus
[01:49:01] they achieved a high standard of morale.
[01:49:04] The elements underscored by Admiral Moril deserve special note, saddest faction in a work
[01:49:10] program, mutual confidence between leaders and ranks conviction that all together were striving
[01:49:16] for something more important than themselves.
[01:49:19] Talk about the CB's, the construction battines and the Navy that do engineering work overseas
[01:49:27] and I actually had CB's with us in a remedy that were awesome, awesome guys that didn't
[01:49:33] everything for us, they kept everything going, kept everything running, kept everything working,
[01:49:38] built everything that we used awesome guys and every CB I've ever worked with has been
[01:49:45] just a beast, they have that attitude.
[01:49:48] They know they're gonna, their motto is can't do and believe me when you tell them to
[01:49:52] do something, they're 100% into that motto right there, they're gonna make it happen.
[01:49:58] Here we go back to the book, talking about Moril.
[01:50:01] Training conditions are in combat, the mental ills and the resulting morale, moral and
[01:50:06] physical deterioration which sometimes be set military forces cannot be cured simply
[01:50:12] by the intensification of disciplinary methods.
[01:50:16] Can't just turn it up.
[01:50:18] It is true that the signs of recovery will sometimes attend the installation of a more rigid
[01:50:24] or less rigid discipline.
[01:50:27] You can't just go up or down.
[01:50:29] The onset is in fact usually due to the collateral influence of an increased confidence
[01:50:35] in the command, whereby men are made to feel that their own fortunes are on the mend.
[01:50:42] Then discipline and morale are together revitalized almost as if by throwing an electric
[01:50:48] switch.
[01:50:51] In Army history there's no better example of the working of this principle than the
[01:50:56] work of Brigadier General Paul B. Malone.
[01:51:00] He took over, this is World War I, 1919.
[01:51:03] He took over a command where slackness and indiscipline were general.
[01:51:08] The men were suffering terrible privation and too many of their officers were indifferent
[01:51:12] to their needs.
[01:51:14] Many of them had been battle casualties, some had been discharged from hospitals before
[01:51:18] their wounds were healed, the mess was abominable.
[01:51:21] The camp was short of firewood and other supply, in freezing weather, men were sleeping
[01:51:26] on the ground with only a pair of blankets of peace.
[01:51:30] The death toll from influenza pneumonia and the aggravation of battle wounds rose daily.
[01:51:36] The spare and resentment over these conditions began to express itself in semi-violent form.
[01:51:43] Every fresh breath of discipline was counted with harassing punishments until an air of
[01:51:47] wretched stagnation hung over the whole camp.
[01:51:52] General purging visited the base.
[01:51:54] The men refused to form for him.
[01:51:59] The men were through the generals coming in the men were not going to form up for him.
[01:52:02] When he tried to address them at a mass meeting they wouldn't hear him out.
[01:52:07] Instead of taking any action against the men he sent for general Malone.
[01:52:12] The new commander arrived without any instructions except to determine what was wrong and
[01:52:16] correct it.
[01:52:17] It's sogently instinct he recognized that the indiscipline of the camp was an effect
[01:52:23] and not a cause.
[01:52:26] But even as he gave orders for leaving the physical distress of the men he demanded
[01:52:30] that they returned to orderly habits.
[01:52:32] He walked around the areas already on his orders.
[01:52:35] On his orders duckboards were being laid throughout the mud.
[01:52:39] And the whole physical setup was in a process of reorganization.
[01:52:42] The men, grown listless from weeks of mistreatment, paid no heed.
[01:52:48] Get on your feet.
[01:52:49] I'm your general.
[01:52:50] I respect you but I want your respect to where his words.
[01:52:54] They restored the whole situation.
[01:52:56] The first impact of this one man on the camp that was never forgotten by anyone who saw
[01:53:01] it.
[01:53:03] It is a point to remember, a firm hold at the beginning pays tenfold dividend of the
[01:53:09] timid approach.
[01:53:11] World by a show of firmness later on.
[01:53:14] Within 48 hours the physical condition of the camp was showing improvement and 60,000 men
[01:53:20] were again doing their duty and bearing themselves in a military manner.
[01:53:25] The lessons from this one incident stand out like beams from a search light battery.
[01:53:32] Leadership.
[01:53:37] One man is able to accomplish a miracle by an active will accompanied by good works.
[01:53:43] The morale of the force flows from self-discipline of the commander.
[01:53:48] And in turn the discipline of the force is reestablished by the upsurge of its moral power.
[01:53:58] Another example here, when the redeployment period which followed World War II threatened
[01:54:02] to complete collapse to the morale of the general military establishment, the remedy
[01:54:06] attempted by some unit leaders was to relax discipline and the work requirement all around.
[01:54:13] Other officers met this crisis by improving the conditions of work, setting an example
[01:54:17] which proved to the men that they believed in its importance and paying sensuous attention
[01:54:22] to the personal problems of those within the unit.
[01:54:25] They found that they could still get superior performance in the midst of chaos, organic
[01:54:31] strength materializes in the same way on the field of war.
[01:54:35] However, adverse the general situation, men will stick to the one man who knows what he wants
[01:54:42] to do and welcomes them to a full share in the enterprise.
[01:54:51] Leadership, leadership and leadership.
[01:54:54] Most important thing on the battlefield.
[01:55:00] In the words of Colonel G. F. R. Henderson, it is the leader who reckons with the human
[01:55:06] nature of his troops and of the enemy rather than with their mere physical attributes,
[01:55:12] numbers, armament and the like who can hope to follow in Napoleon's footsteps.
[01:55:17] Got to know your people, got to know human nature.
[01:55:20] Got to know human nature.
[01:55:22] It's more important than physical, more important than people you got.
[01:55:25] More important than their weapons, human nature.
[01:55:32] There are a few governing principles and before considering their application in detail,
[01:55:37] we should first think about the file.
[01:55:40] So now we're talking about a guy, a troop, a soldier.
[01:55:43] He is a man.
[01:55:45] He expects to be treated as an adult, not a school boy.
[01:55:49] He has rights.
[01:55:50] They must be made known to him and thereafter respected.
[01:55:55] He has ambition.
[01:55:57] It must be stirred.
[01:55:59] He has a belief in fair play.
[01:56:02] It must be honored.
[01:56:04] He has the need of comrade ship.
[01:56:07] It must be supplied.
[01:56:10] He has imagination.
[01:56:12] It must be stimulated.
[01:56:14] He has a personal sense of dignity.
[01:56:17] It must not be broken down.
[01:56:20] He has pride.
[01:56:23] It can be satisfied and made the bedrock of his character once he gains assurance that
[01:56:28] he is playing a useful and respected part in a superior and successful organization.
[01:56:35] To give men working as a group, the feeling of great accomplishment together is the
[01:56:40] acne of inspired leadership.
[01:56:45] You could basically, if you're going into a leadership position, just read that to yourself
[01:56:48] every morning.
[01:56:50] Just what your support and what they are.
[01:56:54] A man, be treated as adult, not a school boy.
[01:56:58] Those are just so important the way you view your troops.
[01:57:04] Some people have a hard time with that.
[01:57:06] Some people have a hard time with that.
[01:57:12] Next section is called knowing your job.
[01:57:17] In one of his little known passages, Robert Lewis Stevenson, Dr. Jackalomester Hyde,
[01:57:25] and the perfect portrait of the man who finally failed in everything because he never
[01:57:31] learned how to take hold of his work.
[01:57:33] It goes like this.
[01:57:35] His career was one of Unbroken Shame.
[01:57:39] He did not drink.
[01:57:41] He was exactly honest.
[01:57:42] He was never rude to his employers.
[01:57:45] He was everywhere discharged.
[01:57:48] Bringing no interest to his duties, he brought no attention.
[01:57:54] His day was a tissue of things neglected and things done a mess.
[01:58:01] And from place to place and from town to town, he carried the character of one thoroughly
[01:58:06] incompetent.
[01:58:10] That's how we started this conversation.
[01:58:11] Today we started talking about doing your job.
[01:58:15] Now this is important.
[01:58:17] Just as a rough approximation, any officers work week should comprise about 50% execution
[01:58:23] and the other half study if he is to make the best use of his force.
[01:58:30] The woods are loaded with go-getters who claim they are men of action and therefore have
[01:58:35] no need of books.
[01:58:38] We're talking about studying.
[01:58:40] We're talking about reading and studying.
[01:58:43] These guys that say that there's no need for books, they are of the same bone and marrow
[01:58:50] as the drone who is always counseling half-speed.
[01:58:55] Don't sweat.
[01:58:56] Just get by.
[01:58:57] Extra work means short life.
[01:58:59] You're better off if they don't notice you.
[01:59:03] This chant can be heard by anyone who cares to listen.
[01:59:06] It's the old American invitation and mediocrity.
[01:59:11] But not always them is to be found in books.
[01:59:14] And at no time is this more true than when one is breaking in.
[01:59:18] What is expected of any novice in any field is that he will ask questions.
[01:59:26] Smart ones if possible, but if not, then questions of all kinds until he learns that there
[01:59:30] is no such item as revely oil.
[01:59:35] And that skirmish line doesn't come on spools.
[01:59:39] So revely oil, revely is when you wake up in the morning.
[01:59:43] And revely oil is something that doesn't actually exist.
[01:59:46] But you'd say to a new guy, we need to get some revely oil for tomorrow.
[01:59:49] Can you go down to supply and get it for me?
[01:59:50] Or skirmish line to skirmish line is when you get online to engage the enemy.
[01:59:55] Get online and put your guns in the same direction.
[01:59:57] That's called a skirmish line.
[01:59:59] Well, he said, hey, we need a spool, a skirmish line.
[02:00:02] Echo, can you run down to the supply department and get us a roller skirmish line?
[02:00:05] That's kind of like little practical jokes.
[02:00:07] But his point is, here, people ask me to solve them.
[02:00:09] Well, you know, I just checked in.
[02:00:10] I'm just taking over as leader.
[02:00:11] I'm just, you know, I'm a new officer.
[02:00:12] I'm getting commissioned.
[02:00:13] What should I do?
[02:00:14] How should I lead?
[02:00:15] Ask questions.
[02:00:16] There's nothing wrong with it.
[02:00:17] There's nothing wrong with it.
[02:00:21] Back to the book.
[02:00:22] Wisdom begins at the point of understanding that there is nothing shameful about ignorance.
[02:00:30] It is shameful only when a man would rather remain in that state than cultivate other
[02:00:35] men's knowledge.
[02:00:37] There is never any reason why he should hesitate for his better to be embarrassed from seeking
[02:00:42] counsel than to be found short for not having sought it.
[02:00:51] Ideally, any officer should be able to do the work of any man under him.
[02:00:56] However, it is obviously absurd to expect that any officer could know more about radio repair
[02:01:03] than his repairman.
[02:01:04] For about mapping than his cartographical section, more about moving parts than a gunsmith,
[02:01:13] more about radar than a specialist in electronics, and more about cipher than a cryptographer.
[02:01:20] The distinction lies in the difference between the power to do a thing well and that of
[02:01:24] being able to judge when it is done well.
[02:01:28] A man can say a book is bad, though not knowing how to write one himself provided he
[02:01:33] is a student of literature, though he is never laid in egg he can pass fair judgment
[02:01:39] on an omelet.
[02:01:42] So this is another thing, you know, you're not going to know everything as a leader.
[02:01:46] You know, that I know as much about sniper, sniping as my sniper did I even know close.
[02:01:52] You know, that I know as much about, just like he said, I was much about the radio, is
[02:01:56] my radio-mended?
[02:01:57] No, no, close to what they knew.
[02:02:01] You don't need to know everything, but you have to have an understanding of it.
[02:02:05] And you have to at least be able to understand that something is being done right or wrong.
[02:02:12] This is another good point.
[02:02:14] We can ponder the words of William Hazlet, a man who shrinks from a collision with his
[02:02:19] equals of superiors will soon sink below himself.
[02:02:23] We improve by trying our strength with others, not by showing it off.
[02:02:30] So you can't be afraid to bring stuff up to your superiors.
[02:02:33] Do you got to be respectful?
[02:02:34] Yes, you do.
[02:02:36] But instead of just being a yes man, don't be that.
[02:02:41] Now this next section.
[02:02:48] It's called writing and speaking.
[02:02:52] Other things being equal a superior rating will invariably be given to the officer who
[02:02:57] is preserved in his studies of the art of self-expression.
[02:03:03] While his colleague who attaches little importance to what may be achieved through working
[02:03:07] with the language will be marked for mediocrity.
[02:03:12] So we're talking about reading and speaking, writing and speaking.
[02:03:17] As the British statesman does Rayleigh put it, men govern with words.
[02:03:25] Within the military establishment command is exercised through what is said, which commands
[02:03:31] attention and understanding and through what is written, which directs, explains, interprets
[02:03:39] or informs.
[02:03:42] Battles are one through the ability of men to express concrete ideas in clear and unmistakable
[02:03:49] language.
[02:03:54] Battles are one through clear and unmistakable language.
[02:03:59] That's how battles are one.
[02:04:01] Back to the book, all administration is carried forward along the chain of command by the
[02:04:05] power of men to make their thoughts articulate and available to others.
[02:04:12] There is no way under the sun that this basic condition can be altered.
[02:04:19] Once the point is granted, any officer should be ready to accept its corollary.
[02:04:23] That superior qualification in the use of language both as to the written and the spoken
[02:04:28] word is more essential to military leadership than knowledge of the whole technique of weapons
[02:04:34] handling.
[02:04:38] So when people ask me why I studied English in college, this is why I studied English
[02:04:43] in college.
[02:04:47] Some men will take refuge in the excuse offered by the great majority.
[02:04:53] I'm just a simple fighting file with no gift for writing or speaking.
[02:04:59] That is the mark of an officer who has no ambition to properly qualify himself and is seeking
[02:05:05] to justify his own laziness.
[02:05:11] And the reason he's saying that is because he thinks that you can become a good writer.
[02:05:16] Back to the book, writers are self-made.
[02:05:19] But it is a reasonable speculation that history might never have heard of the greater number
[02:05:25] of these men.
[02:05:27] Had they not worked sedulously to become proficient with the pen as well as with the sword.
[02:05:38] Men who command words to serve their thoughts and feelings are well on their way to
[02:05:43] commanding men to serve their purposes.
[02:05:47] All senior commanders respect the junior who has a faculty for thinking and idea through
[02:05:54] and then expressing it comprehensively and clear, unvarnished phases.
[02:05:59] So your young young leader out there, young trooper, think about improving your method
[02:06:06] of thought, think about making your speech more clear.
[02:06:12] Many men who has the brain to qualify for commission can make of himself a competent writer.
[02:06:18] Because of natural limitations, he may never excel in this art, but if he has had average
[02:06:23] schooling, knows how to open a dictionary, can find his way to the library and is willing
[02:06:27] to commit himself to long study and practice, particularly in non-duty hours, and will
[02:06:33] finally free himself from the superstition that writing is a game only for specialists.
[02:06:38] He can acquire all the skill that is necessary to further his advance within the military
[02:06:44] profession.
[02:06:46] But where should work begin, how about a little practical advice?
[02:06:51] The only way to learn to write is to write.
[02:06:56] That's it.
[02:06:58] There's no other secret, other than hard, unremitting practice.
[02:07:05] Most writers at the start are mentally muscle bound and poorly coordinated.
[02:07:10] They have thoughts in their head.
[02:07:13] They think they can develop them clearly, but when they try to apply a largely dormant
[02:07:18] vocabulary to the expression of these thoughts, the result is stiff and self-conscious.
[02:07:24] Self-conscious.
[02:07:25] The only cure for this is constant mental exercise with one's pen or over one's type
[02:07:33] writer.
[02:07:35] The discipline, through which one learns to write adds substance to thought, whereby one's
[02:07:41] ideas are given body and connection.
[02:07:46] Such common faults as worreness over statement, faulty sentence structure and weak
[02:07:52] use of words are gradually corrected with their passing confidence grows.
[02:08:00] This does not mean however that the task becomes easy.
[02:08:05] So you can get better this game.
[02:08:08] You just got to practice.
[02:08:09] Kind of like getting better at pull ups.
[02:08:10] I get better at pull ups.
[02:08:11] Do pull ups.
[02:08:12] Do pull ups.
[02:08:13] Now this is interesting.
[02:08:14] Speaking of reading and or speaking of writing, now we get into reading a little bit
[02:08:18] here.
[02:08:20] This is good.
[02:08:22] It is a good habit to underscore passages and books which have contributed something
[02:08:26] vital to one's own thought.
[02:08:29] Break out the high lighters.
[02:08:32] I kind of laughed when I read that because I have a lot of high lighters.
[02:08:37] I think you went winchester on a couple of days.
[02:08:40] Yeah, that's right.
[02:08:44] Now this is talking about going back to writing again as a practical matter is better to concentrate
[02:08:47] on a few elementary rules of thumb, such as our contained in the following list, then
[02:08:53] to bog down attempting to heed everything that the pendants have said about how to become a writer.
[02:09:00] So here's some advice on writing and you'll notice that these are good advice on life.
[02:09:05] The more simply a thing is said, the more powerfully it influences those who read.
[02:09:10] Plain words make strong writing.
[02:09:14] There is always one best word to convey a thought or a feeling, to accept the weaker
[02:09:19] substitute rather than to search for the right word will deprive any writing of force.
[02:09:27] Economy of words in the great composition.
[02:09:32] In all writing but in military writing particularly, there is no excuse for vague terminology
[02:09:38] or phrases which do not convey an exact expression of what was done or what is intended.
[02:09:44] And just think about how you communicate with your subordinates and think about these rules.
[02:09:49] So impactful.
[02:09:52] This is a good one.
[02:09:53] It is better at all times to reign in.
[02:09:57] The strength of military writing like the soundness of military operations does not gain
[02:10:02] through overstatement and artificial coloring.
[02:10:06] The bigger the subject, the less it needs in pro-eatery.
[02:10:12] Now, it's going to start talking here, go from talking about writing to talk about speaking.
[02:10:19] A majority of the world's most gifted writers would in all probability be dumbstruck
[02:10:24] if put before an audience.
[02:10:27] Though dealing confidently with ideas, they lack the confidence when dealing with people.
[02:10:34] The military officer has need of both talents and as to where the accent should be placed
[02:10:40] to this probably more important that he should speak well than his writing prose should
[02:10:46] be polished.
[02:10:49] A unit commander may permit a clerk or a subordinate to do the greater part of his paperwork,
[02:10:54] either because his own time is taken with other duties or because he is awkward at it.
[02:10:58] But if he permits any other voice to dominate the councils of the organization, he soon
[02:11:04] ceases to exercise moral authority over it.
[02:11:09] So you gotta be confident in your speaking.
[02:11:12] A little bit more important than the writing because you can have your guys do some writing.
[02:11:16] Yeah, I'll sign it.
[02:11:17] Looks good to me.
[02:11:19] This guy, one of the bosses I had.
[02:11:24] So he'd always misuse words, almost to the point where you know how some comedians will
[02:11:29] do that, like he'll misuse.
[02:11:30] He notch does that a lot of time, but this guy would for real do it.
[02:11:35] But you know what it was, is you know how the guy who's, they want to try to sound smart
[02:11:41] basically and got a good idea.
[02:11:44] Like, so he would use the word like irregardless.
[02:11:48] He would say irregardless, this is a supposed to regardless.
[02:11:50] And then there's another one that it's so funny because it was so counterproductive because
[02:11:55] when he would talk and we'd all be holding in our laughter and I'd work with this other
[02:11:58] guy.
[02:11:59] He was a kind of relentless jokes, you know, when you're gone.
[02:12:03] So if you did something and in this case you'd misuse words or when he leaves brother jokes
[02:12:07] would come and it'd be just so funny.
[02:12:09] But nonetheless he would use behoof, you know, behoof.
[02:12:13] It would behoof.
[02:12:14] Yeah, here's a behoof.
[02:12:15] I think it is behoof, but you're right, because that's what I thought anyway, that's
[02:12:20] a whole lot of thing.
[02:12:21] But anyway, behoof then.
[02:12:22] So he would misuse that word.
[02:12:24] He would, he thought it meant what, he thought it meant baffling.
[02:12:29] Like, you know what really behoves me is that they do it this way.
[02:12:33] And then he keep doing it, you know.
[02:12:35] And so anyway, the point there is where you kind of, you got to know how to talk, right?
[02:12:41] So, and in this case, this was, this wasn't like some high levels like speeches he was
[02:12:46] making or addressed the game.
[02:12:48] It was just like normal stuff.
[02:12:50] So right, I thought that that was kind of critical in the way we regarded him as a part.
[02:12:56] That was one of the major things where we can't even take this guy seriously.
[02:13:01] Yeah, because he be hoofs me with everything.
[02:13:04] He was really be hoofing.
[02:13:06] He was like, oh, you're wrong usage.
[02:13:09] It's okay, people.
[02:13:10] Yeah, it's not okay.
[02:13:11] I guess the point there, a Nora separate point is learn the words, be free, start trying
[02:13:17] to throw them out, I guess.
[02:13:19] And that goes, that would be your scene.
[02:13:20] That would be very, yeah, that would be who, what you're saying about, it's better to
[02:13:25] seek the knowledge and be embarrassed because you got to seek to rather than get it called
[02:13:32] out when you don't know it or whatever.
[02:13:34] Anyway, the opportunity was to.
[02:13:38] Back to the book, the matter of nerve is a main element in speaking.
[02:13:45] When an officer is ill at ease, fidgety and not to the point, the vote of his command for
[02:13:49] the time being is no confidence.
[02:13:53] And so long as he remains that way, they will not change.
[02:13:56] No matter though, his good will shines for through another acts.
[02:14:02] So that's what you just said, if someone's jacked up when they're trying to talk to you
[02:14:06] and talk to the group, your vote is no confidence.
[02:14:09] Yeah, that's a constant vote.
[02:14:13] As for this is a good, back to the book.
[02:14:17] As for how an officer should talk to his men, his manner in tone should be no different
[02:14:23] than if he were addressing his fellow officers or for that matter, a group of the intellectual
[02:14:27] and political peers from any walk of life.
[02:14:31] If he is stuffy, he will not succeed.
[02:14:34] If he affects a superior manner, that is a mark of his inferiority.
[02:14:40] If he is patronizing and talks to grown men as a teacher might talk to a class of adolescence,
[02:14:46] the rug figuratively will be pulled out from under him.
[02:14:52] His audience will put down what put him down as a chump.
[02:14:56] It is curiously the case that the junior officer who can't get the right pitch when he
[02:15:00] talks to the ranks will also be out of tune when he talks to his superiors.
[02:15:06] This failing is a sign mainly that he needs practice in the school of human nature.
[02:15:13] I listening a little more carefully to other men, he may find himself in time, attain maturity.
[02:15:22] Another good way to get better at speaking is by listening.
[02:15:26] No doubt.
[02:15:31] When you're speaking sometimes you're instructing in one of the pieces here is called the
[02:15:36] Art of Instruction because you spend so much time when you're in a leadership position.
[02:15:41] You're instructing people whether you realize you're instructing people.
[02:15:44] Here's the rules that they say to follow.
[02:15:46] Keep it simple.
[02:15:47] Have one main object, stay on the course, remain cheerful, be enthusiastic, put it out
[02:15:54] as if the ideas were as interesting and novel to you as to your audience.
[02:16:02] This is a story which really doesn't know what has to do with instruction, but it's
[02:16:06] cool stories from the reading anyways because it's just badass.
[02:16:10] In World War I, the American major, named now long forgotten was given the task of making
[02:16:15] the rounds and talking to all combat formations and convincing them that the future was bright.
[02:16:21] No boy scout Aaron.
[02:16:22] So you imagine your world war one.
[02:16:24] We've talked about that.
[02:16:26] It's a nightmare in his job as to go around and ensure people that the future is bright.
[02:16:32] But wherever he went, morale was lifted by his words.
[02:16:36] And substance, in substance, what he said was this.
[02:16:41] None of us cares about making a living with any individuals who wants every break his own
[02:16:46] way.
[02:16:47] But when the odds are even, the gamble is worth any good man's time.
[02:16:52] So let's look at the proportion.
[02:16:55] You now have one chance and two.
[02:16:58] You may go overseas or you may not.
[02:17:01] Suppose you do.
[02:17:02] You still have one chance and two.
[02:17:03] You may go to the front or you may not.
[02:17:06] If you don't, you'll see a foreign country at Uncle Sam's expense.
[02:17:09] If you do, you'll find out about war, which is the toughest chance of them all.
[02:17:16] But up there, on the front, you still have one chance and two.
[02:17:21] You may get hit or you may not.
[02:17:24] If you breeze through it, you'll be a better man for all the rest of your life.
[02:17:29] And if you get hit, you still have one chance and two.
[02:17:34] You may get a small wound and become a hero to your friends and family.
[02:17:41] Or there is always the last chance that it may take you out all together.
[02:17:46] And while that is a little rugged, it is at least worth remembering that very few people
[02:17:52] seem to get out of this life alive.
[02:17:56] Classic.
[02:17:58] Classic.
[02:18:02] Now talking about reading Napoleon once said that the point that a trouble with books
[02:18:10] is that one must read so many bad ones to find something really good.
[02:18:14] True enough.
[02:18:15] But even so, there are perfectly practical ways to advance rapidly without undue-waste
[02:18:20] emotion.
[02:18:21] Consider this, among one's superiors, there are always discriminating men who have
[02:18:25] adopted a few good books after reading many, many bad ones.
[02:18:30] And they say that a text is worthwhile, it deserves reading and careful study.
[02:18:37] So, what books did somebody you respect read?
[02:18:41] They said it's good book, read it.
[02:18:43] Now you gotta be careful because the well-read man need not have more than a dozen books
[02:18:52] in his home provided that they all count with him.
[02:18:55] And he continues to pull over them and ponder the weight of what is said.
[02:18:59] On the other hand, the ignorant man is frequently marked by his bookshelf stocked with titles
[02:19:05] not one of which suggests that he has any professional discernment.
[02:19:11] Now I can tell you right now, I'm building a library of books that's kind of crazy
[02:19:17] because every time somebody hits me up on social media and says, hey, you gotta shout
[02:19:23] this book.
[02:19:24] I used to go on Amazon and kind of look at read reviews now.
[02:19:27] I just wore a grit.
[02:19:28] I mean, basically order it because I don't have time and it's hard to tell from the reviews
[02:19:33] and it takes much time.
[02:19:34] It's easier just to push click by now.
[02:19:37] Yeah.
[02:19:38] Amazon, I'm clicking through the Jockel Podcast Store website.
[02:19:41] So we're giving back to the podcast.
[02:19:45] But the thing is, a lot of people might think this book is great.
[02:19:49] All this to be a great book, but it doesn't quite work.
[02:19:53] So I'm probably getting, I'd say one out of every five books that I ordered to
[02:19:57] say, yeah, this one's this one's game.
[02:20:00] Yeah.
[02:20:01] What he's saying there about the difference between somebody who was a huge stock
[02:20:06] of books is he's saying like a variety of different books that doesn't, it's
[02:20:11] something but not indicating any kind of expertise or something.
[02:20:14] It just says he just shows that he doesn't have any discernment.
[02:20:17] This guy just buying a bunch of books.
[02:20:19] He might not know anything about him.
[02:20:20] It doesn't mean it don't touch a book by its cover.
[02:20:23] Pond intended.
[02:20:24] You know, just because this guy's got a bunch of books.
[02:20:25] It doesn't mean that he's read them all doesn't mean that he actually, they're all
[02:20:30] great books.
[02:20:31] Really?
[02:20:32] I can tell you right now, they're not long-grain books in the world.
[02:20:34] Yeah.
[02:20:35] A lot of books are not good.
[02:20:36] And you shouldn't waste your time reading them.
[02:20:38] But if you walked into a guy that was smart that you were speculated 12 books, I would
[02:20:42] just write them all down and go buy them all.
[02:20:44] Yeah.
[02:20:45] And you're probably going to be 10 for 12 for 12.
[02:20:47] Yeah.
[02:20:48] Or at least 10 for 12.
[02:20:49] Whereas if I go into your room and you've got 570 books in there, yeah.
[02:20:54] These are all great books.
[02:20:56] There's something wrong with your discernment.
[02:20:57] You don't know what a good book is.
[02:20:59] Yeah.
[02:21:00] So get some discernment.
[02:21:01] Or I'm just trying to make like I read so much.
[02:21:03] You're going to make 570 books.
[02:21:09] This section, your relationships with your men.
[02:21:15] And I had to break.
[02:21:16] I had to say this part.
[02:21:17] And officers not expected to appear all wise to those who serve under him.
[02:21:22] So often guys feel that pressure that they think they should know everything.
[02:21:24] Yeah.
[02:21:25] Oh my gosh.
[02:21:26] I don't know if I admit that.
[02:21:27] I don't know this.
[02:21:28] I'm going to look bad.
[02:21:29] Bluffing ones away through a question when ignorant of the answer is full-hardy business.
[02:21:34] I'm sorry, but I don't know.
[02:21:35] It's just as appropriate from an officer's lips is from any other.
[02:21:39] And it helps a little more to add, but I'll find out.
[02:21:44] Rank should be used to serve one's subordinates.
[02:21:47] It should never be flaunted or used to get the upper hand of a subordinate any situation
[02:21:51] safe where he has already discredited himself in an unusually ugly or unseemingly manner.
[02:21:59] When suggestions from any subordinate are adopted, the credits should be passed on to him
[02:22:03] publicly.
[02:22:05] When a subordinate is made a mistake, but not from any lack of good will, it is common
[02:22:10] sense to take the rap for him rather than make him suffer doubly for his error.
[02:22:15] An officer should not issue orders which he cannot enforce.
[02:22:20] He should be as good as his word at all times and in any circumstance.
[02:22:25] He should promise nothing which he cannot make stick.
[02:22:29] An officer should not work looking over his men's shoulders, checking on every detail of what
[02:22:33] they're doing and calling them to account at every furlong past.
[02:22:40] This made and lead attitude corrode confidence and destroys initiatives so don't micromanage.
[02:22:46] On the other hand, contact is necessary at all times, particularly when men are doing long-term
[02:22:52] work or operating in a detachment at a remote point.
[02:22:55] They will become discouraged and will lose their sense of direction unless their superior
[02:22:59] looks in on them periodically.
[02:23:02] Ask them whether he can be of any help and so doing gets them to open up the discussion
[02:23:08] and the problem.
[02:23:11] The Navy says this is another good one right here.
[02:23:16] The Navy says it isn't courtesy to change the set of the sale within 30 minutes after
[02:23:21] the relief of watch.
[02:23:23] Applied to command job this means that it is a mistake for an officer on taking a new
[02:23:28] post to order sweeping changes affecting the other men.
[02:23:32] In the belief that this will give a reputation for action and firmness.
[02:23:37] The studying of the situation is the overture of the setting of it.
[02:23:43] The story is told of Curtis E. Lamay of the Air Force taking over the 21st bomber
[02:23:49] command and the Mariana's.
[02:23:51] He faced the worried staff officers of his predecessor and said quietly, you're all
[02:23:57] staying put.
[02:23:58] I assume you know your jobs or you wouldn't be here.
[02:24:03] Pretty simple.
[02:24:04] Then people always ask, come into a new year.
[02:24:06] What do I do when I take over?
[02:24:08] Relax.
[02:24:09] Be humble.
[02:24:10] Listen.
[02:24:11] Observe.
[02:24:12] Don't need to jump in there and change the set of the sale.
[02:24:13] All right, echo's gone now.
[02:24:14] I'm in charge.
[02:24:15] Change everything.
[02:24:16] No, wrong answer.
[02:24:20] This next section, your men's moral and physical welfare.
[02:24:25] When men are moral, the moral power which binds them together and fits them for high
[02:24:30] action is given its main chance for success.
[02:24:37] Now listen to these.
[02:24:40] To be temperate and all things, to be content and refrain from loose living of any sort
[02:24:45] are acts of the will.
[02:24:48] They require self-denial and are forgoing of that which may be more attractive in favor
[02:24:54] of the thing which should be done.
[02:24:58] Granted there are few individuals who are so thin blooded that they never feel tempted to
[02:25:02] digress morally.
[02:25:05] Men in the majority are not like that.
[02:25:07] So there's some guys that just on the straight narrow.
[02:25:09] They're so thin blooded that they just get no temptations.
[02:25:14] Most men, they get temptations.
[02:25:16] What they were now in the name of self-discipline at the cost of a considerably and considerable
[02:25:22] interest, they endeavored to compensate by gains in their personal character.
[02:25:28] Making that grade isn't easy, but no one who is anyone has yet said that it isn't worthwhile.
[02:25:36] In the armed services they're an old saying that an officer without character is more useless
[02:25:41] than a ship with no bottom.
[02:25:44] In summing up the strength of will, which enables a man to lead a clean life is no different
[02:25:51] than the strength of purpose which fits him to follow a hard line of duty.
[02:25:57] There are exceptions to every rule.
[02:25:59] Many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.
[02:26:05] But even though he had an uncorcoable weakness for drinking women, his resolution had
[02:26:11] to become steeled along some other line or he would have been no good when the payoff came.
[02:26:18] So this is saying that the strength of will that it takes to stay strong in all these
[02:26:24] situations, all these temptations that will is real and that can transfer over.
[02:26:31] Now I can tell you that this one is there's all the militaries filled.
[02:26:38] He says many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.
[02:26:42] Of course, guys, they're bad ass guys throughout the ages that were even Henry the
[02:26:48] fifth out of wild man reputation.
[02:26:51] Going back to Shakespeare.
[02:26:56] So, but he's saying that these staying on the straight narrow enforces your will is what
[02:27:04] he's saying.
[02:27:05] Back to the book, putting aside for the moment the question of the vices and regarding
[02:27:09] only the gain to moral power, which comes of bodily exercise and physical condition.
[02:27:15] So he's talked about vices, okay, we got it.
[02:27:18] Stay clean.
[02:27:20] Stay clean is what he's saying.
[02:27:21] But now he's saying there's something else or something called exercise and physical conditioning.
[02:27:27] It should be self-evident that the process which builds the muscle must also train and
[02:27:31] alert the mind.
[02:27:33] How could it be otherwise?
[02:27:36] Every physical act must have as its origin, a mental impulse, conscious or unconscious.
[02:27:43] Thus, in training a man to master his muscles, we also help him to master his brain.
[02:27:50] He comes out of physical training not only better condition to move, but better prepared
[02:27:56] to think about how and why he is moving, which is true mobility.
[02:28:02] So you want to strengthen your will?
[02:28:04] Yes.
[02:28:05] Stay clean.
[02:28:06] Stay on the moral path and then get your physical conditioning on because that's going
[02:28:12] to make you mentally tougher.
[02:28:15] Back to the book in the United States service, we are tending to forget because of the
[02:28:19] effective motorization that the higher value of the discipline of the road march in other
[02:28:26] days wasn't that it hardened the muscles.
[02:28:30] But that short of combat, it was the best method of separating the men from the boys.
[02:28:37] This is true today, despite all the new conditions imposed by technological changes.
[02:28:41] A hard road march is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength of the
[02:28:47] individual man.
[02:28:50] At the same time, to sensibly overload men, for road marching hurts them in two ways.
[02:28:55] So there's a dichotomy to everything.
[02:28:58] So you can hurt them with the road march.
[02:29:00] Here's the two ways.
[02:29:01] It weakens their faith in the sense of the command, thereby impairing morale, and it breaks
[02:29:07] down their muscle and tendon.
[02:29:09] So you overload them, you're going to crush them, you're going to break them, and you're
[02:29:11] going to ruin their spirit.
[02:29:14] There is another not infrequent cause of breakdown.
[02:29:18] The leader who makes the mistake of thinking that every man's limit is the same as his
[02:29:23] own.
[02:29:26] So you, oh, I can do this.
[02:29:29] I can dump in 20 miles or 20 clicks.
[02:29:32] Everyone can do it, wrong answer.
[02:29:35] When an officer does this kind of thing thoughtlessly, he shows himself to be an incompetent
[02:29:39] observer of men.
[02:29:41] He does it to show off he deserves to be given 10 days in the electric chair.
[02:29:47] Hey, there you go.
[02:29:49] Get me electric chair, 10 days.
[02:29:51] That's like how many times do you die in 10 days in the electric chair?
[02:29:54] No, a lot.
[02:29:55] But don't show off.
[02:29:56] It's the point.
[02:29:57] Yeah.
[02:29:58] Otherwise you're going in the electric chair for 10 days.
[02:30:00] But isn't that like an old classic thing in the movie where it's usually to combat
[02:30:05] like a situation where the guys are complaining.
[02:30:07] You know, all of this is unrealistic.
[02:30:09] I don't know, obstacle course.
[02:30:12] Yeah.
[02:30:13] And then the drill sergeant or whoever.
[02:30:15] He does it.
[02:30:16] You know, he's like the older guy.
[02:30:18] Well, yeah, he's proving that look.
[02:30:19] I'm not asking you do anything that I wouldn't do myself.
[02:30:21] Yeah.
[02:30:22] That's all that that is.
[02:30:23] Right.
[02:30:24] But in a way, he's like, hey, I can do it.
[02:30:27] So you should be able to do it.
[02:30:28] That's true.
[02:30:29] Guess what?
[02:30:30] A young recruit should be able to do it.
[02:30:33] Oh, what's it?
[02:30:35] Otherwise you're not reaching the standards.
[02:30:36] We've got to have standards.
[02:30:38] Yeah.
[02:30:39] But if you were saying, hey, you should be able to do this with one on a time behind
[02:30:43] your back like I can.
[02:30:44] Could have been a big wrong.
[02:30:45] Yeah.
[02:30:46] You see the difference, sir?
[02:30:47] Oh, yeah.
[02:30:48] Because I make sure, because otherwise you can get me on the tech
[02:30:49] Picallity.
[02:30:50] Don't want that to happen over here.
[02:30:52] Speaking of athletic accomplishments in the nature of things, the officer who's
[02:30:57] been an athlete can fit himself into this part of the program with little difficulty and with
[02:31:02] great credit provided he acts with moderation that it here is suggested.
[02:31:07] By the same token, the officer who has shunned sports in school either because he didn't
[02:31:11] have the size or coordination or it's more interested in something else will frequently
[02:31:15] have an understandable hesitation about trying to play the lead hand in anything which
[02:31:20] he thinks will make him look bad.
[02:31:22] Just talking about the benefits of the sports.
[02:31:28] If he has not kept himself in good physical shape, his nerves will not be able to stand
[02:31:34] the strain of combat to say nothing of his legs.
[02:31:39] It can be said again and again, the highest form of physical training that an officer
[02:31:43] can undergo is the physical conditioning of his own men.
[02:31:47] Nothing else can give him more faith in his own ability to stay the course and nothing
[02:31:51] else is likely to give him a firm or feeling of solidarity with his men.
[02:31:57] Study and an active thirst for wider professional knowledge have their place in an officer's
[02:32:01] scheme of things but there is something about the experience of bodily competition of
[02:32:07] joining with and leading men in strunuous physical exercise which uniquely invigorates
[02:32:13] one spirit with the confidence I can do this.
[02:32:17] I can lead.
[02:32:18] I can command.
[02:32:22] The body and minor connected everybody.
[02:32:26] No it.
[02:32:29] Back to the book, the really good thing about the gain and moral force deriving from
[02:32:33] all forms of physical training is that it is an unconscious gain.
[02:32:39] Willpower, determination, mental poise and muscle control all march hand in hand with
[02:32:45] the general health and well-being of the man.
[02:32:48] With results not less decisive under training conditions than on the field of battle.
[02:32:54] A man who develops correct posture and begins to fill out his body so that he looks
[02:32:58] the part of a fighter will take greater pride in wearing of the uniform.
[02:33:03] In doing so, he will take greater care to conduct himself morally that he will not disgrace
[02:33:09] it.
[02:33:10] He will gain confidence as he acquires a confident and determined bearing.
[02:33:16] The same presence and the physical strength which contributes to it will help carry him
[02:33:21] through the hour of danger.
[02:33:24] The strength of will is partly of the mind and partly of the body.
[02:33:30] In combat fatigue will be down men as quickly as any other condition for fatigue inevitably
[02:33:38] carries fear with it.
[02:33:41] Tired men are afraid.
[02:33:45] There is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the road for lack of preliminary
[02:33:49] hardening intrups such a condition cannot be redeemed by the resolve of a commander who insists
[02:33:56] on driving troops and extra mile beyond their general level of physical endurance.
[02:34:01] So if you got guys that aren't ready, just because you're fired up doesn't mean it's
[02:34:05] going to work.
[02:34:06] You can't push them hard now.
[02:34:07] Here's what happens.
[02:34:08] Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command and thus strike
[02:34:13] a tactical efficiency from two directions at once for when men resent a commander they will
[02:34:20] not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent, their nerves are gone.
[02:34:30] Physical conditioning.
[02:34:33] Now on top of that we got the physical conditioning.
[02:34:35] You also have to keep your people informed in war in the absence of information,
[02:34:43] natural promptings alternate between unresening fears that the worst is likely to happen
[02:34:50] and a wispful thought that all danger is remote.
[02:34:54] Either impulse is a barrier to the growth of that condition of alert confidence which
[02:34:59] comes to men when they have a realization of their own strength and a reasonably clear
[02:35:05] concept of the general situation.
[02:35:10] You've got to keep your people informed as well as talking about earlier being at the
[02:35:13] end of a poll tune.
[02:35:18] Next section is about counseling your men.
[02:35:21] Nothing more unfortunate can happen to an officer than to come to be regarded by his
[02:35:26] support and says unapproachable.
[02:35:29] For such a reputation itulates him from the main problems of the command, responsibility
[02:35:35] as well as its chief rewards.
[02:35:37] Now, how do you become approachable?
[02:35:41] The two formal manner, the overrigid attitude, the disposition to deal with any human
[02:35:47] problem by the numbers as if it were one more act in an organizational routine can have
[02:35:52] a chilling effect upon men.
[02:35:56] So that idea that you're just going to be by the book on everything that's not going
[02:36:00] to make you approachable.
[02:36:03] That being said, back to the book, it is not necessary that an officer wet nurse is
[02:36:07] men in order to serve well in the role of counsel.
[02:36:11] His door should be open, but he's not play the part either of father, confessor, or
[02:36:16] of a hotel greeter.
[02:36:19] Neither great solony or a fusedness are called for, but mainly serious attention to the
[02:36:24] problem and then straightforward advice or decision.
[02:36:28] According to the nature of the case and provided that from his own knowledge and experience,
[02:36:32] he feels qualified to give it.
[02:36:36] If not, it is wiser to defer than to offer a half-baked opinion.
[02:36:41] So that's okay if you don't know.
[02:36:43] Hey look, I don't know.
[02:36:44] I'm done with this before.
[02:36:46] Maybe you should go talk to Echo, he deals with these computers all the time, come
[02:36:50] to me with your computer problems.
[02:36:55] Back to the book, World War II officers had to abide by this standard dealing with
[02:36:59] the general malaise which rose out of redeployment.
[02:37:05] When a man came forward and said that he couldn't take it anymore and the commander knew
[02:37:09] that he'd always been a highly, doodiful individual, it became the commander's job to attempt
[02:37:14] to get the man home.
[02:37:16] But when a second man came forward with the same story and the record showed that he'd always
[02:37:21] shirked his work, the question was whether he should be given the final chance to shirk
[02:37:26] it again.
[02:37:28] The favor of the first man meant furthering discipline.
[02:37:32] His comrades recognized it as a fair deal.
[02:37:36] To turn back the second man was equally constructive to the same end.
[02:37:41] So those are just classic.
[02:37:43] We've seen that in just about every book we read.
[02:37:45] With some guy World War II, we saw a bunch of it.
[02:37:48] Some guy would just lose it and we even saw the Korean, some of the Korean books we've
[02:37:51] covered.
[02:37:52] The guy loses it.
[02:37:53] But they're a good guy.
[02:37:54] Remember the guy walked around and asleep in the back.
[02:37:55] Look, we're just going to take care of this guy.
[02:37:57] He's been a good guy.
[02:37:58] We'll get him off the front.
[02:37:59] He's got a few days left.
[02:38:01] But then when you get a guy that's weak and scared and doesn't man up and do his duty, and
[02:38:06] he wants to go home, they're not giving that guy the slack.
[02:38:08] Doesn't deserve it, didn't earn it.
[02:38:14] Now this is interesting.
[02:38:16] There are officers who hold every subordinate like Grim Death, seeing no better way to advance
[02:38:22] their personal fortunes.
[02:38:24] So this is what we're talking about here is, and this happens a lot in the military.
[02:38:27] It happens in every business I work with where you got people that are being moved around.
[02:38:31] So like, oh, echo works.
[02:38:33] You got this guy Billy that works for you.
[02:38:34] Hey, I need Billy to help me with this project.
[02:38:36] What do you say?
[02:38:37] No, you can't have him.
[02:38:39] He's my guy.
[02:38:40] What are you working on right now?
[02:38:41] I got some projects coming up.
[02:38:42] I need him right now.
[02:38:43] Don't say I have a project.
[02:38:44] You know what I'm saying?
[02:38:45] Some people go into that mode where they hold everyone like a Grim Death.
[02:38:49] They're officers who hold every able subordinate like Grim Death, seeing no better way to
[02:38:53] advance their personal fortunes.
[02:38:56] This is a sign of moral weakness, not of strength, and it is inevitable fruit.
[02:39:03] And it's inevitable fruit is discontent within the organization.
[02:39:07] The sign of superiority in any officer at whatever level is his confidence that he can make
[02:39:13] another good man to fill any vacancy.
[02:39:18] The other time I don't like that is when somebody, you know, if you're going to give
[02:39:21] me Billy and it's actually a promotion for Billy, it's like a step up, but you don't
[02:39:25] want to give me any of these.
[02:39:26] You're hurting him because you're trying to help yourself.
[02:39:29] No, give the guy up.
[02:39:30] Find somebody else new.
[02:39:31] Find a better person.
[02:39:32] Find somebody who's going to mold and make better.
[02:39:34] Yeah, that happened to me before.
[02:39:36] Were you the guy?
[02:39:38] Were you the guy?
[02:39:40] The guy that got didn't get promoted?
[02:39:42] Correct.
[02:39:43] Somebody held onto you.
[02:39:44] Yeah, and it was less about if I did or didn't get promoted, it was that he was just
[02:39:51] holding on.
[02:39:52] Where, you know, took kind of negating any chance of that.
[02:39:55] It was clear.
[02:39:56] He actually even told me to.
[02:39:58] Well, that was at least straightforward of him.
[02:40:01] Yeah.
[02:40:02] Not good.
[02:40:03] How that work out for you for your morale?
[02:40:07] It didn't help.
[02:40:08] What are the other way?
[02:40:12] Back to the book.
[02:40:13] Some of the ableist commanders in our service have abided by this rule.
[02:40:17] They never denied the man who had a legitimate reason for transfer.
[02:40:21] And they never shuffled off their lemons and gold bricks under a false label.
[02:40:28] So that does another thing that happened in businesses.
[02:40:31] Hey, you got Billy, he'd Billy's a bum.
[02:40:33] And I say, hey, echo, I need a guy over here to help me with this.
[02:40:36] Oh, yeah, you can have Billy.
[02:40:37] Great guy.
[02:40:38] Yeah.
[02:40:39] You can be Billy, he's a disaster.
[02:40:40] That's a gold brick.
[02:40:41] It's a lie.
[02:40:45] Here's a few common sense rules which when followed will enable any officer to play
[02:40:51] his part more effectively in the counseling of men.
[02:40:54] And excess of expression is a failing.
[02:40:58] So when you give away your facial expression, looks all that's a failing.
[02:41:03] To listen well is the prelude toward pondering carefully and speaking wisely.
[02:41:08] Listen, got to listen.
[02:41:12] To refuse with kindness is more winning than to acquiesce ungratiously.
[02:41:18] That's a good one.
[02:41:21] Just anyone I don't think it's going to be rather than all right.
[02:41:24] Yeah.
[02:41:25] That's something you've got to deal with with your wife.
[02:41:27] Your wife wants to go do something.
[02:41:29] If you'd be better to say, you know what I'm thinking?
[02:41:31] All right, let's not do that tonight.
[02:41:32] Let's do this other thing instead.
[02:41:35] As opposed to all right, fine.
[02:41:36] We'll go to your friend's house.
[02:41:39] Don't want to do that.
[02:41:41] Yeah, I feel like a dick when you get there.
[02:41:43] Yeah.
[02:41:44] To note another man's mood and become congenial to it is the surest way to engage
[02:41:50] his confidence.
[02:41:53] Decisions which are holy of the heart and not of the mind will ultimately do hurt
[02:41:59] to both places.
[02:42:02] Use your logic.
[02:42:03] Don't get emotional.
[02:42:06] No man will talk freely if met by silence.
[02:42:09] But an intelligent question encourages frankness above all else.
[02:42:17] When a man loses possession of himself, it is the more reason that the other should
[02:42:22] tighten his reserve legit.
[02:42:28] This is a good one.
[02:42:29] To express pity for a man does not serve to restore him and put him above pity.
[02:42:38] And a man is so burdened by a personal problem that it shuts out all else.
[02:42:43] He must be led to something else.
[02:42:47] And the last one here, impudent tactics can undo the wise strategy.
[02:42:53] And that happens at every level that happens in a ward, happens in business.
[02:42:57] Got a great strategy, but the guys on the ground are really not doing it tactically well.
[02:43:03] Doesn't matter the strategy you're going to fail.
[02:43:07] The encountering like all else in military life has a combat purpose.
[02:43:14] Other things being equal, the tactical unity of men working together in combat will
[02:43:19] be in ratio to their knowledge and sympathetic understanding of each other.
[02:43:25] Whatever the cause, aloofness, on the part of the officer can only produce a further
[02:43:31] withdrawal on that part of the man, aloofness.
[02:43:42] Now the last section of this book was really devastating on my highlighter.
[02:43:50] It's called Americans in combat.
[02:43:56] The command and control of men in combat can be mastered by junior leaders of American forces
[02:44:00] short of actual experience under enemy fire.
[02:44:04] It is altogether possible for a young officer as first time in battle to be in total possession
[02:44:09] of his faculties and moving by instinct to do the right thing provided that he has made
[02:44:15] the most of his training opportunities.
[02:44:20] Exercise in the maneuvering of men is only an elementary introduction to this educational
[02:44:26] process.
[02:44:27] The basic requirement is continuing study first of the nature of men, second of the techniques
[02:44:33] which produce unified action and last of the history of past operations which are covered
[02:44:40] by an abundant literature.
[02:44:42] That's how you got to get ready for combat.
[02:44:45] Those things right there.
[02:44:47] Now there are a few simple and fundamental propositions which the armed services subscribe
[02:44:52] in saying to officer corps what may be expected of the average man of the United States under
[02:44:58] battle conditions.
[02:45:01] Generally speaking they have held true of Americans in times past from Lexington to Okinawa.
[02:45:07] The fighting establishment builds its discipline, training, code of conduct and public
[02:45:13] policy around these ideas believing that what served yesterday will also be the one best
[02:45:19] way tomorrow.
[02:45:21] And for so long as our traditions and our system of freedom survives, these propositions
[02:45:26] are when led with courage and intelligence and American will fight as willingly as and
[02:45:34] as efficiently as any fighter in world history.
[02:45:39] I can occur with that.
[02:45:41] His keenness and endurance and war will be in proportion to the zeal and inspiration
[02:45:46] of his leadership.
[02:45:49] He is resourceful and imaginative and the best results will always flow from encouraging
[02:45:56] him to use his brain along with his spirit.
[02:46:02] Under combat conditions he will reserve his greatest loyalty for the officer who is most
[02:46:08] resourceful in the tactical employment of his forces and most careful to avoid unnecessary
[02:46:15] losses.
[02:46:18] So the soldiers going to know if you're throwing bodies away they're going to know it.
[02:46:22] The same thing in the business world.
[02:46:23] I've worked with a lot of companies where they do their utmost to let's say there's a
[02:46:28] downturn in the market and they're going to fire some people and they do their best
[02:46:34] to mitigate that.
[02:46:35] That develops loyalty.
[02:46:37] That makes them fight harder when the market turns back around.
[02:46:40] Now sometimes that can be a problem because people try and be so loyal that they'd run
[02:46:44] their business in the ground.
[02:46:45] And they fail.
[02:46:50] Back to the book except on a Hollywood lot there is no such thing as an American fighter
[02:46:55] type.
[02:46:57] Our best-month men come in all colors, shapes and sizes.
[02:47:03] They appear from every section of the nation including the territories.
[02:47:10] In battle, Americans do not tend to fluctuate between emotional extremes in complete
[02:47:16] rejection one day and exaltation the next according to the changes in the situation.
[02:47:22] They continue on the whole on a fairly even kill when a going is tough and when things
[02:47:27] are breaking their way.
[02:47:30] Even when heavily shocked by battle losses they tend to bound back quickly.
[02:47:36] Though their griping is incestant, their natural outlook is on the optimistic side and
[02:47:43] they react unfavorably to the officer who looks eternally on the dark side.
[02:47:52] Next, during battle American officers are not expected either to drive their men or to be
[02:47:58] forever in the van as if praying to be shot.
[02:48:02] So the van is like on the front lines, the front of your formation.
[02:48:07] So long as they are with their men taking the same chances as their men and showing a firm
[02:48:13] grasp of the situation and of the line of action which should be followed, the men will
[02:48:19] go forward.
[02:48:22] In any situation of extreme pressure or more exhaustion where men cannot otherwise be rallied
[02:48:28] and led forward, officers are expected to do the actual physical act of leading such as
[02:48:36] performing as first scout or point, even though this means taking over what would normally
[02:48:42] be an enlisted man's function.
[02:48:45] The normal next, the normal, grigarius American is not at his best when playing alone
[02:48:52] handed or tactically isolated part in battle.
[02:48:56] He is not a comacosio or a one-man torpedo.
[02:49:00] Consequently, the best tactical results obtained from those dispositions and methods which
[02:49:05] link the power of one man to that of another.
[02:49:10] Men who feel strange with their unit, having been carelessly received by it and indifantly
[02:49:16] handled will rarely, if ever, fight strongly and courageously.
[02:49:22] And if treated with common decency and respect, they will perform like men.
[02:49:28] So that's just talking when you check in somewhere.
[02:49:31] If you're in a military and you get somebody that checks in, take care of them.
[02:49:34] Welcome.
[02:49:35] If you're to company in somebody checks in, take care of them.
[02:49:37] Welcome, show them around to sign a mentor, get them in the game.
[02:49:43] To lie to American troops to cover up a blundering combat rarely serves any valid purpose.
[02:49:51] They have a good sense of combat and an uncanny instinct for ferooding out the truth when
[02:49:57] anything goes wrong tactically.
[02:50:01] They will excuse mistakes, but they will not forgive being treated like children.
[02:50:09] Basic leadership.
[02:50:14] Good one here.
[02:50:16] And spit and polish are laid on so heavily that they become onerous.
[02:50:21] And the ranks cannot see any legitimate connection between the requirements and the development
[02:50:27] of an attitude which will serve a clear fighting purpose.
[02:50:30] It is to be questioned that the exaction serves any good object, whatever.
[02:50:36] So again, I'm like leaning in the sealed teams.
[02:50:39] I'm probably the extreme level of military bearing and uniformity, but I'm definitely not
[02:50:47] a believer that you got everything.
[02:50:49] Every single thing spit and polish all day long.
[02:50:53] And they're saying clearly here that if you go so far in that direction and people don't
[02:50:57] make any sense of it, it's not going to be good.
[02:50:59] I mean, even picture, you know, hack worth was like Mr. Spit and polish.
[02:51:03] Look at pictures of hack worth and Vietnam.
[02:51:05] You wouldn't even wear a rank.
[02:51:10] He makes one of the guys from that come into the camp that look like they're in parade
[02:51:13] ground uniforms.
[02:51:16] I saw a quote, like yesterday, said a spotless house is the sign of a wasted life, which
[02:51:26] when I saw it, I tend to disagree with a lot because it basically takes one kind of perspective
[02:51:33] and makes it into this thing.
[02:51:37] But with this one, I was like, well, or it means you clean your house all the time.
[02:51:44] That's where you know, maybe you're disciplined.
[02:51:46] You clean your stuff, including your house.
[02:51:49] I don't know.
[02:51:50] Maybe take care of your house.
[02:51:51] Maybe you're a clean person.
[02:51:52] That's not a waste of life by the way.
[02:51:54] Yeah, I think that's an extreme statement, but I think the underlying message is, hey,
[02:52:00] live a little.
[02:52:01] It's basically, yeah, in a way, it's kind of the
[02:52:03] message there is kind of what you're saying.
[02:52:05] If you take it literally, yeah, that could you could go too far down that road.
[02:52:09] But just take it as a message.
[02:52:13] I think the message is fairly clear.
[02:52:15] And I, I get some more to agree with that.
[02:52:16] Yeah, like you spent your whole life making sure everything in your house is clean.
[02:52:20] Yeah, you know, they say also, like the highly polished samurai sword that's never been
[02:52:26] used in battle is a lot less valuable to me than the switchblade knife that's rusty from
[02:52:33] blood.
[02:52:34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:52:35] K-bar that's rusty from blood.
[02:52:37] Yeah.
[02:52:38] Yeah.
[02:52:39] Next one.
[02:52:42] On the other hand, because standards of discipline and courtesy are designed for the
[02:52:48] express purpose of furthering control under the extraordinary frictions and presions of
[02:52:53] the battlefield, their maintenance under combat conditions is as necessary as during training.
[02:53:01] This and respect are the marks of military alertness, no matter how trying the circumstances.
[02:53:07] But courtesy starts at the top in the dealing of any officer with his subordinates and in
[02:53:12] the decent regard for their loyalty, intelligence and manhood.
[02:53:17] So even though you can't be over-discipline, you've to go to have the discipline.
[02:53:23] Next though Americans enjoy relatively about to fall.
[02:53:29] Even luxurious standard of living in their home environment, they do not have to be pampered,
[02:53:35] spoon fed, or overfilled with every comfort and convenience to keep them steadfast and
[02:53:42] devoted once war comes.
[02:53:45] They are by nature rugged men and in the field they will respond most perfectly when
[02:53:49] called on to play a rugged part.
[02:53:53] Soft handling will soften even the best men.
[02:53:59] But even the weak man will develop a new vigor and confidence in the face of necessary
[02:54:04] hardship if moved by a leadership which is courageously making the best of a bad situation.
[02:54:12] It's just awesome.
[02:54:14] Soft handling will soften even the best men and the weak man will come around for a necessary
[02:54:22] hardship.
[02:54:23] You notice they put that word in their nest and not just being them up for no reason.
[02:54:26] They gotta see why it is.
[02:54:30] Next, extravagance and wastefulness is somewhat rooted in the American character because
[02:54:35] of our mode of life.
[02:54:37] When our men enter the military service, there's a strong holdover from their civilian
[02:54:42] habits.
[02:54:43] Even under fighting conditions, they tend to be wasteful of drinking water, food, munition,
[02:54:47] and other vital supply when such things are made to accessible.
[02:54:51] They tend to throw them away rather than conserve them in the general interests.
[02:54:56] This is a distinct weakness during combat.
[02:54:59] When conservation of all supplies, the touchstone of success, the regulating of all supply
[02:55:05] and the preventing of waste in any form is the prime obligation of every officer.
[02:55:15] Be frugal.
[02:55:19] Next, under the conditions of battle.
[02:55:22] Any extra work, exercise, maneuver, or marching, which does not serve a clear and direct
[02:55:27] operational purpose is unjustifiable.
[02:55:31] The supreme object is to keep men as physically fresh and mentally alert as possible.
[02:55:36] Tired men take fright and are half whipped before the battle opens.
[02:55:41] War now officers cannot make clear decisions.
[02:55:44] The conservation of men's powers, not the exhaustion thereof, is the successful way of
[02:55:50] operations.
[02:55:56] Next, when forces are committed to combat, it is vital that not one unnecessary pound
[02:56:02] be put on any man's back.
[02:56:06] Lightness of foot is the key to speed of movement and the increase of fire power.
[02:56:11] And judging of these things, every officer's thoughts should be on the optimistic side.
[02:56:16] It is better to take the chance that men will manage to get by on a little less than to
[02:56:19] overload them through over cautious reckoning of every possible contingency thereby destroying
[02:56:27] their power to do anything effectively.
[02:56:31] Every pound counts.
[02:56:33] They used to when I was at a team two, they had winter warfare plethora and so you'd be up burning
[02:56:40] calories on skis and those guys were so anal about making their gear as light as possible
[02:56:47] was pretty impressive.
[02:56:48] So, you know when you got a backpack or something and it's got straps, you know, that
[02:56:51] you can loosen up or tighten up.
[02:56:53] They would through the whole backpack, they would cut off any excess strap would be gone.
[02:56:59] Just get everything as light as possible.
[02:57:07] It's kind of a good strategy to follow when you travel.
[02:57:10] You know, you know, you know, how like you know what the funny thing is, too, is I've
[02:57:14] got this now.
[02:57:15] I've got this pretty down.
[02:57:16] What I'm like, you know what if I don't have this, if I don't bring this and I need
[02:57:19] it, I'm just going to buy it.
[02:57:21] But go to a wherever and buy it.
[02:57:22] No factor.
[02:57:23] No.
[02:57:30] Yeah.
[02:57:33] And because there's kind of those two like schools that thought, I don't know, whatever, two ways to think about it.
[02:57:30] Where the person is like, I might need it.
[02:57:32] So I'm going to bring it.
[02:57:33] Another person is like, if I can't think of a specific time that I'm going to need this on the
[02:57:38] strip, I'm not going to bring it.
[02:57:39] And just like how you say it, if I need it, I'll buy it there.
[02:57:43] Travel light for you tonight.
[02:57:45] Yeah, that's all right.
[02:57:47] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:57:48] It's all over the level.
[02:57:50] Just unity of action develops from fullness of information.
[02:57:56] In combat, all ranks have to know what is being done and why it is being done.
[02:58:02] If confusion is to be kept to a minimum, this holds true in all types of operations
[02:58:07] or whatever the service.
[02:58:11] However, a surplus of information clouds the mind and may sometimes depress the spirit.
[02:58:16] We can take one example.
[02:58:17] Commander might be confronted by a complex situation and a solution may be a continuing
[02:58:22] operation in three distinct phases.
[02:58:25] It would be advisable that all hands be told the complete detail of phase A, but it might
[02:58:29] be equally sensible that his subordinates only his subordinates who are closest to him be made
[02:58:35] fully informed about phase B and phase C.
[02:58:38] All plans and combat are subject to modification as to circumstances dictate.
[02:58:43] This being the case.
[02:58:44] It is not better.
[02:58:46] It is better not to model the men by filling their minds with a seemingly conflict of ideas.
[02:58:53] A conflict in ideas.
[02:58:55] More important still, if the grand object seems too vast and formidable, even the
[02:59:00] first step toward it may appear doubly difficult.
[02:59:04] Fulness of information does not void the other principle that one thing at a time carefully
[02:59:10] organized all down the line is the surest way, prioritizing execute.
[02:59:18] There is no next, there is no excuse for malingering or cowardice during battle.
[02:59:24] Is the task of leadership to stop it by whatever means would seem to be the surest cure
[02:59:30] always making certain that in doing so it will not make a matter worse.
[02:59:38] Next.
[02:59:39] The armed services recognize that there are occasional individual school nervous and spiritual
[02:59:44] makeup may be such that they are road rapidly and may suffer complete breakdown under combat
[02:59:49] conditions.
[02:59:51] They still may be a holy loyal and conscientious men capable of doing duty elsewhere.
[02:59:58] Men are not alike.
[02:59:59] In some, however, willing the spirit, the flesh may be too weak.
[03:00:05] The punish, degrade or in any way, humiliate such men is not more cruel than ignorant.
[03:00:13] When the good faith of any individual has been repeatedly demonstrated in the earlier service,
[03:00:17] he deserves the benefit of the doubt from his superior pending study of his case by medical
[03:00:22] authority.
[03:00:23] But if the man has been a bad actor consistently, his officers were wanted in proceeding
[03:00:28] on the assumption that his combat failure is just one more grave moral dereliction.
[03:00:33] The failed to take proper action against such a man can only work unusual hardship on the
[03:00:39] majority trying to do the duty.
[03:00:45] Next.
[03:00:46] The United States abides by the laws of war.
[03:00:50] Its armed forces in dealing with all other peoples are expected to comply with the laws of
[03:00:57] war in the spirit and to the letter.
[03:01:01] In waging war, we do not terrorize helpless non-combatants.
[03:01:06] If it is within our power to avoid doing so, want in killing, torture, cruelty, or the
[03:01:12] working of unusual and unnecessary hardship on enemy prisoners or populations is not justified
[03:01:19] under any circumstance.
[03:01:22] Likewise, respect for the reign of law as that term is understood by the United States's
[03:01:28] expected to follow the flag wherever it goes.
[03:01:33] Piliging, looting, and other excesses are as a moral as unmoorled where Americans are operating
[03:01:40] under military law as they are living together under civil code.
[03:01:46] Nonetheless, some men in the American services will loot and destroy properly unless
[03:01:50] they are restrained by fear of punishment.
[03:01:54] War loses violence and disorder.
[03:01:58] The inflames, passions and makes it relatively easy for the individual to get away with
[03:02:02] unlawful actions.
[03:02:05] But it does not lessen the gravity of his offense or make it less necessary that constituted
[03:02:11] authority put him down.
[03:02:14] The main safeguard against lawlessness and who lunagonism in any armed body is the integrity
[03:02:21] of its officers.
[03:02:23] And men know that their commander is absolutely opposed to such excesses and will take
[03:02:29] forceful action to repress any breach of discipline they will conform.
[03:02:36] But when an officer winks at any degradation by his men, it is no different than if he had
[03:02:44] committed the act.
[03:02:47] Remember that one, young leaders out there on the battlefield.
[03:02:51] An officer winks at any degradation of his men.
[03:02:56] There's no different than if he had committed the act.
[03:02:58] And if you hold the discipline, if you hold the discipline, they will conform.
[03:03:04] If they know where you fall, where you stand, I should say, if they know where you stand,
[03:03:10] they will conform.
[03:03:14] Next, on the field of sport, Americans always talking up to keep nerve steady and to generate
[03:03:20] confidence.
[03:03:21] The need is even greater on the field of war and the same treatment will have no less
[03:03:25] effect.
[03:03:26] When men are afraid, they go silent.
[03:03:31] Silence of itself further intensifies the fear.
[03:03:35] The resumption of speech is the beginning of thoughtful, collected action.
[03:03:42] For self-evidently, two or more men cannot join strength and work intelligently together
[03:03:47] until they know one another's thoughts.
[03:03:50] Once a importantly, all training is an exercise in getting men to open up and become articulate,
[03:03:57] articulate even as it is a process in conditioning them physically to move strongly together.
[03:04:06] Once again, step and even talking is action that starts to dispeel fear.
[03:04:14] Next, inspection is more important in the face of the enemy than during training because
[03:04:19] a found piece of a found piece may mean a lost battle and overlooked sick man may infect
[03:04:25] a fortress and a misled message can cost a war.
[03:04:29] In virtue of his position, every junior leader is an inspector and the obligation to make
[03:04:35] certain that his force at all times is inspection proof is unremitting.
[03:04:42] And the last one I'm going to read to close out this book is here in battle crisis.
[03:04:49] A majority of Americans present present will respond to any man who has the will and the
[03:04:56] brains to give them a clear, intelligent order.
[03:05:01] They will follow the lowest ranking man present if he obviously knows what he is doing
[03:05:07] and is morally the master of the situation.
[03:05:13] But they will not obey a chuckle head if he has nothing in his favor but his rank.
[03:05:26] And that's it for this book and I think that closing statement.
[03:05:35] Don't be a chuckle head.
[03:05:39] Don't be a chuckle head and this is talked about earlier that they will follow the lowest
[03:05:44] man.
[03:05:45] The lowest-making ranking man present if he knows what he is doing and is morally the master
[03:05:51] of the situation and can give a clear, intelligent order.
[03:05:58] And I think the rest of you know if you're a chuckle head people are going to listen to
[03:06:01] you just because of your rank and talk about that all the time.
[03:06:04] You shouldn't use your rank.
[03:06:08] And I think this book actually gives some pretty obvious ways to avoid being a chuckle
[03:06:17] head.
[03:06:18] Be humble, become, educate yourself, work out hard, physical, physicality is important.
[03:06:28] It's all the stuff, same stuff that we talk about all the time.
[03:06:32] And again, these are universal.
[03:06:35] And I know we got a lot of listeners that are over.
[03:06:36] See, this stuff is supplying to Americans for this applies basically worldwide at least
[03:06:43] Western world.
[03:06:46] And they've stood the test a time.
[03:06:48] They work today.
[03:06:50] So follow them.
[03:06:53] And cold blind.
[03:06:57] And lead with this lead and everything you do and start by leading yourself with these
[03:07:04] principles because if you can't, there's no way that you can lead others if you can't
[03:07:15] lead yourself.
[03:07:18] And I'll tell you where little over the three-hour mark right now.
[03:07:23] So it doesn't look like we're going to be doing Q&A this episode.
[03:07:28] So if anyone is out, they're still listening at this point.
[03:07:32] And they want to know how to support the podcast.
[03:07:37] Echo, tell them how to do it.
[03:07:39] Well, there's a few ways.
[03:07:42] Yeah, so let's start with the, a lot of times I feel like I'm, it's just like kind of
[03:07:48] repetitive.
[03:07:49] Well, it is repetitive.
[03:07:50] Yeah.
[03:07:51] We've already had people listening for three plus hours at this point.
[03:07:55] We can feel free to move quickly, I think.
[03:07:57] Yeah, I think so.
[03:07:58] But here's the thing though.
[03:07:59] Oh, there's a butt.
[03:08:00] I did, yeah, I did more thinking.
[03:08:02] Where what if this is the first time somebody was listening or maybe the second time
[03:08:08] won't be as repetitive.
[03:08:10] Okay, but if it's person that they're going to listen to other ones, sure to go back.
[03:08:15] Yep.
[03:08:18] And they can listen to one of those episodes.
[03:08:19] That's an hour and a half.
[03:08:21] And they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to listen to a little bit more.
[03:08:23] But right now, if we go long right now, they may not listen at all.
[03:08:28] Yeah.
[03:08:29] Now, some people say, what do it's fun?
[03:08:30] We like that.
[03:08:31] No.
[03:08:32] No.
[03:08:33] Nothing is fun after three hours.
[03:08:34] I don't know.
[03:08:35] I went long.
[03:08:36] Well, there's so much good information in this book though.
[03:08:38] I went long.
[03:08:39] I'm sorry.
[03:08:40] But I'm not really sorry.
[03:08:42] There's a good information.
[03:08:43] Yeah, that's the game.
[03:08:44] It's good.
[03:08:45] But I think we could proceed quickly.
[03:08:48] That's what I think.
[03:08:49] Yeah, sure.
[03:08:50] I know no banter.
[03:08:51] You know, I know you got things you want to talk about.
[03:08:53] I'm not even in it.
[03:08:54] With the stuff.
[03:08:55] I'm going to avoid the banter.
[03:08:56] The key here is really to, okay, look, I could, okay, we'll go into it on it.
[03:09:01] Supplementation, you know, sometimes, hey, I don't need supplements.
[03:09:06] I have a great diet or I'm just not into it just in general.
[03:09:10] I have to successfully convey the importance of supplementation or at the very least the
[03:09:17] value.
[03:09:18] Go ahead.
[03:09:19] So I'm not going to banter with you.
[03:09:21] I'm just going to go ahead and get after it right here.
[03:09:24] This far as late because you can, you know, all right.
[03:09:26] You know, for a chocolate real quick, on it supplements, if you didn't already know,
[03:09:32] krill oil or EDC, okay, our EDC, every day consumption of supplements, essential krill
[03:09:38] oil for your joints.
[03:09:40] And this is good because this is the legit one.
[03:09:43] It's not the one where they kill a bunch of krill, grind them up and then sell it to you.
[03:09:47] It's like the real deal that helps you.
[03:09:51] I could tell you the story about how it helped me, but let's do the other, listen to the
[03:09:56] other 52 podcasts if you want to hear that story.
[03:09:58] Yeah, just understand if you're going for results on it supplements, krill oil, EDC, krill
[03:10:04] oil, alpha brain, shrimp tech, warrior bars, even though those aren't really supplements,
[03:10:10] they're like, but you do eat them every day.
[03:10:11] Yeah, every day consumption.
[03:10:14] And I got the, the pre-workout.
[03:10:17] How was that?
[03:10:18] Good.
[03:10:19] I'm going to give it a shot.
[03:10:20] Non-stimulate, by the way.
[03:10:22] So that's not a gittery.
[03:10:24] Yeah, nothing like this.
[03:10:25] And it's, um, it's like there's like earth grown ingredients in there as well.
[03:10:29] Good.
[03:10:30] It's actually tastes good.
[03:10:31] You know, so on it calls things earth grown ingredients.
[03:10:34] I'm just going to like know it sounds cool.
[03:10:36] Where else are they grown?
[03:10:37] Space?
[03:10:38] And when it's the cooler, if they grow, it's space or subterranean or something, what's
[03:10:42] up?
[03:10:43] Why are they trying to make it sound cool?
[03:10:44] So what's good stuff?
[03:10:45] How would they say that?
[03:10:46] Well, the answer is grown.
[03:10:47] The answer to that is lab grown.
[03:10:49] If you can roast stuff in the lab or just concoct it, you know, chemically and
[03:10:53] a lab quiet.
[03:10:54] So I'm just saying that's the differentiator.
[03:10:57] You win.
[03:10:58] Which is good.
[03:10:59] You win.
[03:11:00] Earth grown is actually cool.
[03:11:01] It's just a sound cool.
[03:11:02] Okay.
[03:11:03] And if there's any more questions.
[03:11:04] I was thinking space grown.
[03:11:05] I was thinking, I was thinking, I was thinking, move base alpha.
[03:11:09] Yeah.
[03:11:10] And if you can indicate the benefits of anything moon grown, I'm sure that they would
[03:11:13] provide that on the website or whatever.
[03:11:15] That's what I get it for me.
[03:11:16] Anyway, alpha brain is proven as well.
[03:11:19] That's the thing with neutropics, neutropicic to the help of your brain.
[03:11:24] A lot of times people will be like, ah, that's a placebo thing.
[03:11:27] They went through the real test to prove that it works.
[03:11:30] Proven scientifically, fact that it's dope.
[03:11:34] Anyway, on a dot com slash jockel, get 10% off if you want 10% off.
[03:11:38] If you don't want 10% off, just go on a dot com.
[03:11:42] Pay full price.
[03:11:43] Boom.
[03:11:44] Support everybody.
[03:11:45] Everything.
[03:11:46] Actually, not supporting anybody.
[03:11:47] And you're definitely not supporting us.
[03:11:48] If you don't do that, let's go.
[03:11:50] Well, technically it is because it's like you're still getting your supplements.
[03:11:56] You know, you're still getting supplementation.
[03:11:59] We're just not getting the credit.
[03:12:00] So just like if like you donate to a cause and you put anonymous in the thing.
[03:12:06] And then you donate another 10% same thing.
[03:12:08] To him saying anyway.
[03:12:10] I'm going to just let this one go.
[03:12:11] That's a good way.
[03:12:12] Because I realize I'm guilty for making these things longer.
[03:12:15] Because I'm interjecting.
[03:12:16] I should just be quiet.
[03:12:17] Yes, just be quiet.
[03:12:18] Well, it's your podcast.
[03:12:21] So you say whatever you like right here.
[03:12:22] It's all our podcasts.
[03:12:23] Come on.
[03:12:24] So on it is one of the ways to support to wrap it up.
[03:12:28] On the dot com slash jockel, get 10% off.
[03:12:31] Help.
[03:12:32] It's they're good.
[03:12:33] Just trust me.
[03:12:34] They're good.
[03:12:35] Another good way.
[03:12:38] Christmas is almost here, man.
[03:12:39] It's like what?
[03:12:40] Four, three, four days.
[03:12:41] Something like that.
[03:12:43] Something like that.
[03:12:44] If you shop in Amazon, click through the website.
[03:12:47] That's a good way to support.
[03:12:49] Click through the website that's called jockelstore.com or call jockelpodcast.com.
[03:12:54] Yeah.
[03:12:55] Could it.
[03:12:56] That's the website.
[03:12:57] You got to click through.
[03:12:58] Correct.
[03:12:59] Yes.
[03:13:00] Jockelpodcast.com.
[03:13:01] Over on the side is Amazon little banner.
[03:13:03] Click on that one before you do your image like Amazon shopping for Christmas or whatever.
[03:13:07] Or buying any one of these books that the jockel talks about.
[03:13:09] On the jockel store, you got to go on the menu item support.
[03:13:13] And then I'll take you to the page with the bad.
[03:13:14] Yeah.
[03:13:15] Speaking of which podcast 100, as we talked about when Tim was on this podcast.
[03:13:20] Tim Ferris was on this podcast.
[03:13:21] We're going to do Musashi for podcast 100 because it's a big big big book.
[03:13:27] Correct.
[03:13:28] We need to get it on the podcast.
[03:13:30] So that will be on the website.
[03:13:32] So you can buy that book now because it's the thick book.
[03:13:34] And we're going to do it for podcast 100.
[03:13:36] Right.
[03:13:37] You can click through.
[03:13:38] The other thing is that's beneficial about these ways of supporting the podcast.
[03:13:42] No advertisements on the podcast.
[03:13:45] Except for this here, which I guess could be considered an advertisement.
[03:13:49] But I don't want to have the analpha commercial break.
[03:13:54] Yeah.
[03:13:55] We would like to present.
[03:13:56] Yeah.
[03:13:57] Don't.
[03:13:58] Something that doesn't matter.
[03:13:59] Are you tired of sleeping?
[03:14:01] Right.
[03:14:02] You know that kind of stuff.
[03:14:03] Yeah.
[03:14:04] So yeah.
[03:14:05] The Amazon clicked.
[03:14:06] That's a good one.
[03:14:07] That's like because it doesn't cost you nothing.
[03:14:08] It's like super easy.
[03:14:09] And it's like you're kind of just in the whole game of just, you know, reinforcements support.
[03:14:14] Amazon click through the website for you shopping.
[03:14:18] Boom.
[03:14:19] You can also subscribe to the podcast.
[03:14:21] And that seems obvious.
[03:14:23] But sometimes you know, back to this, you know, you talk about this sometimes.
[03:14:28] Amazon.
[03:14:29] So you can click through Amazon.
[03:14:32] Right.
[03:14:33] Let's say you're going to buy something that's not expensive.
[03:14:35] Like a bunch of pens.
[03:14:37] Sure.
[03:14:38] You might think, oh man, I'm just going to go directly to Amazon because that's no big deal.
[03:14:42] Right.
[03:14:43] We don't need to support the podcast on this purchase.
[03:14:45] Right.
[03:14:46] There's two problems with that.
[03:14:47] Number one, if no one bought their duct tape without clicking through, we wouldn't get any of the benefit of having the site there.
[03:14:54] The other thing is.
[03:14:56] You got to exercise daily discipline in all things.
[03:15:00] That doesn't.
[03:15:01] If you get my point is that if you get in the habit of doing it, then you'll be in the habit.
[03:15:04] Otherwise, if you only do it sometimes, then the time you go out and buy.
[03:15:07] A lawn mower.
[03:15:09] Then you know, or somebody bought a set of golf clubs and remember that guy, he says, I just bought some golf clubs.
[03:15:15] Like a $1,000 set of golf clubs clubs.
[03:15:18] He clicked through.
[03:15:19] You know, so that definitely supports the podcast.
[03:15:21] Yeah.
[03:15:22] But it's because he had the discipline, the the.
[03:15:25] Reen forced.
[03:15:27] Reiteration of doing it all the time.
[03:15:29] So it's doing it just do it all the time.
[03:15:31] That's my recommendation.
[03:15:32] Yeah.
[03:15:33] It is true man.
[03:15:34] That's kind of the key is like to remember to do it.
[03:15:37] And here's the and everyone's duct tape counts.
[03:15:39] Yeah.
[03:15:40] And the end here's the thing like you're under no obligation to do that.
[03:15:43] I'm just saying, most times you be like, hey, I want to support podcasts.
[03:15:48] It's cool because, you know.
[03:15:51] But at the time of, you know, hey, and you might duct tape, I go, I do it.
[03:15:55] I buy the duct tape and it's like, oh, I forgot.
[03:15:58] Yeah.
[03:15:59] You know, just to kind of avoid that kind of situation.
[03:16:01] If you have it in your mind, that's really the key is to remember to do it.
[03:16:04] Then you're living with the guilt.
[03:16:06] No man.
[03:16:07] Barely can go on.
[03:16:09] Anyway, yeah.
[03:16:10] So yeah, do that or subscribe to the podcast or and subscribe to the podcast.
[03:16:15] I should say.
[03:16:16] Yeah.
[03:16:17] It seems obvious on iTunes.
[03:16:18] You subscribe, but I don't know if you haven't already.
[03:16:19] Subscribe.
[03:16:20] That's a good way to support and leave a review.
[03:16:22] If.
[03:16:23] If you're compelled to.
[03:16:25] Those reviews are pretty dope.
[03:16:27] By the way.
[03:16:28] I'm subscribed on YouTube. We are along with the podcast and video format.
[03:16:33] We'll do some excerpts.
[03:16:35] Stuff you can share with people that they don't, they don't have to commit to three hours.
[03:16:39] And, you know, however long the case may be to listen to the whole podcast.
[03:16:43] And just listen to the, you know, three minute, one minute, five minute even, you know, things about.
[03:16:48] Whatever case maybe.
[03:16:50] But whatever little excerpts, you know.
[03:16:52] I think those are beneficial.
[03:16:54] I think.
[03:16:55] When people share that kind with me.
[03:16:58] I think you can learn a lot.
[03:17:01] Prischer.
[03:17:02] I think there's, you know, a lot to be said for it.
[03:17:05] But they're going to give you a.
[03:17:06] Or.
[03:17:07] We have a store.
[03:17:09] Jockel has a store.
[03:17:10] It's called.
[03:17:11] So now you say, I have a store.
[03:17:12] We have a store.
[03:17:13] Not my store.
[03:17:14] Yeah, but if I say,
[03:17:16] Jockel has a store.
[03:17:17] It's called Jockel store.
[03:17:19] Okay.
[03:17:20] Sounds kind of cooler.
[03:17:21] Okay.
[03:17:22] And original name too.
[03:17:23] Yeah.
[03:17:24] So I was trying to do that, but can you interrupt your, but that's cool.
[03:17:27] There's some cool shirts on there.
[03:17:29] Some layers on the shirts.
[03:17:30] I'm going to let you look.
[03:17:32] I'm going to let you see the layers on your own.
[03:17:36] So go to jockelstore.com.
[03:17:38] See if you can find the layers on the shirts.
[03:17:41] I'm not saying to buy a shirt or a tank top or a hoodie or a star.
[03:17:46] I'm not saying to buy one.
[03:17:48] But if you feel compelled to buy one because you think they're cool, the layers hit you.
[03:17:51] They resonate with you.
[03:17:53] I don't like the word resonates.
[03:17:55] Use it anyway.
[03:17:56] If they resonate, get a shirt.
[03:17:58] That's a good way to support.
[03:18:01] Some patches too.
[03:18:03] You know the ones that with the Velcro, the regulation.
[03:18:07] Those are on there too.
[03:18:08] Per your and other people's requests.
[03:18:11] We have a lot of military and law enforcement that wanted.
[03:18:14] Yeah.
[03:18:15] Regulation size.
[03:18:16] Yeah.
[03:18:17] Second one.
[03:18:18] In the field.
[03:18:19] Yeah.
[03:18:19] As they're crushing evil in the world.
[03:18:21] Yeah.
[03:18:22] They're on there too.
[03:18:23] And whatever else, you think it's cool.
[03:18:25] I'm going to redo the mugs.
[03:18:26] They're going to be like a special like one.
[03:18:29] Like a super high quality one.
[03:18:31] The travel mugs.
[03:18:32] Yeah.
[03:18:33] And then yeah.
[03:18:34] There you go.
[03:18:35] And then a psychological warfare.
[03:18:38] See that was a done.
[03:18:39] That turned out good.
[03:18:40] It did.
[03:18:41] I'm going to tell you that.
[03:18:42] I was listening to your explanation of what psychological warfare was.
[03:18:46] You need to listen to it.
[03:18:47] It is unclear.
[03:18:49] You told the story.
[03:18:50] But it was like, you know how we're talking to each other right now.
[03:18:53] Yeah.
[03:18:54] And you were telling you, kind of telling me the story.
[03:18:55] Right.
[03:18:56] But I know a bunch about it.
[03:18:57] Yeah.
[03:18:58] So when I listened to it, I said, you know what?
[03:18:59] People that aren't that don't know what this is.
[03:19:01] Are going to wonder what this is.
[03:19:03] Echo ask me some questions about what I'm thinking about in certain situations of weaknesses.
[03:19:09] Right.
[03:19:10] Certain situations of weaknesses.
[03:19:12] And he asked me a couple of minutes.
[03:19:13] And I kind of told him, like, off the cuff.
[03:19:15] Oh, I think about this and this.
[03:19:17] And he's kind of got that looking as face when I know he's.
[03:19:19] I know he's thinking of something.
[03:19:21] So I said, oh, he's thinking of something.
[03:19:23] And then the next day, you know, hey, we got to do record these.
[03:19:27] So he, we came up with some more questions that Echo is like, oh, this is a good one.
[03:19:31] This is a good one.
[03:19:32] Came up with the questions.
[03:19:33] And then I wrote down the answers and I read him into a microphone.
[03:19:39] We recorded it because that's what Echo does.
[03:19:42] And then he said, hey, I'm going to make this into because people ask for ring tones.
[03:19:48] They want to be able to awake to, because they want to feel the wake to me.
[03:19:53] A lot of rocks to stuff.
[03:19:55] So he said, I'm going to put these on iTunes and put them for sale.
[03:20:00] And I said, oh, well, if that's what you think.
[03:20:02] So he, the album is called, so it's an album of clips.
[03:20:07] They're like two or three minutes long.
[03:20:09] They're from there for a cup.
[03:20:12] They're for psychological warfare against moments of weakness.
[03:20:15] Yes.
[03:20:16] And we're in the most one with a weakness come when you want to get up in the morning.
[03:20:19] So there's, there's actually, because I know that's a hard one for people.
[03:20:23] There's three psychological attacks against the weakness of not getting out of bed in the morning.
[03:20:28] There's psychological warfare against wanted to eat bad food.
[03:20:31] There's psychological warfare against procrastination.
[03:20:34] Just moments of weakness are covered in the psychological warfare album.
[03:20:39] Very well covered.
[03:20:40] And it's for sale in iTunes.
[03:20:42] And you've got a search for juggle willing or psychological warfare.
[03:20:47] It's a little bit hard to find because of the way iTunes is laid out because it's in spoken word.
[03:20:52] But that doesn't drop down under music anyways.
[03:20:54] It's kind of hard to find.
[03:20:55] But it is on there.
[03:20:57] And that is, in fact, another way to support the podcast because it is for sale.
[03:21:02] Because people want to support the podcast.
[03:21:04] And so they say, hey, how can we support the podcast?
[03:21:08] And you know, we used to say people say, oh, do you have this thing where you can donate money?
[03:21:12] We'll just give you money.
[03:21:13] Oh, I don't want you just to give me money.
[03:21:15] I want to give you something.
[03:21:17] If you, you just don't give me money.
[03:21:18] I'm not going to take it.
[03:21:20] Well, well, there's been a public couple of people that have given money, which is awesome.
[03:21:23] We appreciate it.
[03:21:24] But for the general, for my general conscience, right?
[03:21:29] Recipercation.
[03:21:31] Want to give you something back.
[03:21:32] So here's what we give you.
[03:21:33] You give us money for the iTunes album.
[03:21:37] You get something back.
[03:21:38] And you know what you get back discipline in MP3 format.
[03:21:42] That's what you get.
[03:21:43] So check it out.
[03:21:44] They're pretty, they're funny.
[03:21:45] They're no screaming, but they're getting after it.
[03:21:48] And the feedback that I've gotten is awesome.
[03:21:49] Like everyone comes to it or so.
[03:21:50] They're like, yeah, I've been out a bit every time.
[03:21:52] Yeah.
[03:21:53] I, I over, you know, I didn't procrastinate on this project.
[03:21:56] I'm going to do that.
[03:21:57] Debbie said, I got this project done a week early because I didn't want to procrastinate.
[03:22:01] You know, but two side notes to that one.
[03:22:04] So if you're going to do the alarm clock thing, this is the last time.
[03:22:09] Clear it with your, whoever you're sleeping with your wife or whatever.
[03:22:13] Just make sure they have the heads up because if they hear it, they're going to flip out.
[03:22:17] Yeah, and they won't flip out because I'm going crazy.
[03:22:19] They'll flip out because all of a sudden there's a man in the real talking.
[03:22:22] Yeah.
[03:22:23] That's enough to freak so bad.
[03:22:24] Okay.
[03:22:25] You got, you know, one.
[03:22:26] Yeah.
[03:22:27] Yeah.
[03:22:28] It's a kind of go over it.
[03:22:29] You know, go over the plan.
[03:22:30] You don't want to freak people out.
[03:22:31] Yeah.
[03:22:32] You're significant other were reaching for their side arm.
[03:22:34] Yeah.
[03:22:35] You don't know.
[03:22:36] Put in laser on around the room searching.
[03:22:38] And a second side note.
[03:22:40] Good feedback for sure.
[03:22:43] But it's been, I look at the stats sometimes.
[03:22:46] It's been number one.
[03:22:48] And spoken word category on iTunes.
[03:22:51] Number one.
[03:22:52] That's pretty good.
[03:22:53] There's some other good people on that list, but it's been number one.
[03:22:56] That's awesome.
[03:22:57] I think since I put, we put it on there.
[03:22:59] Anyway, well, thank you everyone. Yeah, everyone that's picking that up.
[03:23:03] Thank you.
[03:23:04] Appreciate that.
[03:23:05] It's awesome.
[03:23:06] But yeah, those are, yeah, solid ways to support.
[03:23:09] Couple other ways that you can support this one is you can get some juggle white tea.
[03:23:15] It's probably great.
[03:23:16] It's probably great.
[03:23:17] It's probably great.
[03:23:18] It's great.
[03:23:19] Can get some of that stuff.
[03:23:20] If you haven't gotten it and you think I don't like tea.
[03:23:24] You're wrong.
[03:23:26] Because you haven't tried this tea because it tastes, it doesn't taste, I'm telling you, it doesn't taste.
[03:23:31] I don't know what it tastes like.
[03:23:32] You know what it tastes like?
[03:23:33] It tastes like what it tastes like.
[03:23:34] There's nothing else that you compare to.
[03:23:36] It just tastes good, really good.
[03:23:38] And it's got a little bit of caffeine in it.
[03:23:41] You can actually drink it before you go to bed if you need to.
[03:23:44] You won't, and won't keep you up.
[03:23:45] It's not that kind of caffeine.
[03:23:47] It's different kinds of things.
[03:23:48] It's earth-grown caffeine.
[03:23:50] It's kind of caffeine that there's not a lot in there.
[03:23:54] It's got antioxidants in there.
[03:23:56] And it tastes really good.
[03:23:57] And you can have it pre-work out post-work out pre-meal, post-meal, pre-bed after bed during bed.
[03:24:03] You can get it out of it whenever you want.
[03:24:05] So that's the chocolate white tea.
[03:24:07] You can get that.
[03:24:08] And by the way, it's now been in stock.
[03:24:10] I'm going on like three or four or five days.
[03:24:13] It's in stock now.
[03:24:14] We've got a better system.
[03:24:15] We might have another fay.
[03:24:16] And I got some stuff on the horizon.
[03:24:18] There might be a little dip in the system.
[03:24:20] But it's in stock in the tin.
[03:24:23] The luxurious tin?
[03:24:25] The luxurious?
[03:24:26] The luxurious?
[03:24:27] Or the big box, which has a hundred in it.
[03:24:30] But reload.
[03:24:31] Reload.

[03:24:33] You can get a mug, by the way.
[03:24:34] The mug.
[03:24:35] It'll tell you what to do.
[03:24:37] It'll tell you what to do.
[03:24:38] Every single time.
[03:24:39] They won't tell you to do.
[03:24:40] It's good after it.
[03:24:41] To get that mug on their chocolate proved.

[03:26:05] Mustard.

[03:26:51] If you want to kind of kick it with us,
[03:26:55] we are kicking it ourselves on the interwebs on Twitter,

[03:27:07] We're going to be there.
[03:27:11] Echo is at echel Charles and I am at Jocquillic.
[03:27:18] And finally,
[03:27:22] go out there and execute.
[03:27:26] And we talk a lot about a lot of different subjects on this podcast.
[03:27:30] And we hear from incredible leaders and the lessons that we learned today.
[03:27:34] Lessons that were learned and lessons that are written in blood.
[03:27:41] But those lessons are meaningless.
[03:27:45] They're meaningless if you don't execute on them.
[03:27:50] If you listen without doing,
[03:27:53] you might as well not even waste your time.
[03:27:56] Just keep being arrogant,
[03:27:58] wasting your time not being productive,
[03:28:00] and not living up to your potential.
[03:28:03] Just keep wasting your life if you're not going to execute on what we learned.
[03:28:13] But if you listen,
[03:28:16] and then you go and you do,
[03:28:19] then stay on it.
[03:28:21] And remember also that the rewards don't come easy.
[03:28:25] Don't count on any glory.
[03:28:30] Just hold the line and stay on the path so that you know.
[03:28:40] So that you know that you are in the game 100%.
[03:28:49] And that you know that you are getting after it.
[03:28:58] So until next time,
[03:29:01] this is echo and juggle.
[03:29:05] Out.
