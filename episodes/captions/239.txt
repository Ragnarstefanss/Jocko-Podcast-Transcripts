[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 239 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening
[00:00:06] Eko good evening and also joining us tonight is Dave Burke good evening
[00:00:10] Dave good evening. So last podcast we went through the woozy
[00:00:16] Which you did some you did some research and we did not
[00:00:21] Come up with the meaning of the word
[00:00:23] woozy other than room okay so woozy by woochy from ancient China
[00:00:30] a lot of
[00:00:33] solid leadership lessons in there and I was thinking about these leadership principles
[00:00:39] and how leadership principles are not supposed to change
[00:00:43] Right that's kind of you know I say oh you know leadership principles stay the same
[00:00:46] and when you read through the woozy you start to get some supporting evidence to that
[00:00:54] because he's talking about the fact that you need to be beloved but never
[00:00:58] and you need to treat people well and treat them with respect and take care of your people
[00:01:03] which is all things that you know I talk about we all talk about
[00:01:09] but then in the woozy it also says
[00:01:12] to execute anyone that disobeyes your orders
[00:01:18] so so that leads you to think well maybe some principles have changed and you know I used to
[00:01:24] actually have a rationalization for this or an excuse for this and what I would say is
[00:01:31] there's there's a difference in leadership when you're leading conscripts
[00:01:36] instead of volunteers and so as leadership moved away from or military leadership and that
[00:01:45] by the way when you go back in time it's not just military leadership because what are the
[00:01:48] people the people are surfs and peasants and they're being led by these kings
[00:01:53] with divine power so but as time went by it's like okay so that's why the leadership principle
[00:02:01] might not really fit maybe that's why it changed but then I started thinking about that
[00:02:06] what if you go ahead and actually let those things play out right and actually
[00:02:14] that question has been answered right that's what history is and what happens is
[00:02:19] if you're executing people if you're not treating people the right way as leaders what happens
[00:02:24] eventually what do you get you get a revolution you get people to come after you and take you
[00:02:32] out of power and look just like we talk about you can get people on board for a little while right
[00:02:38] if I have you know 5,000 soldiers and they see me execute two people that didn't follow my orders
[00:02:44] they're going to follow my orders for a little while right maybe for a long time maybe since
[00:02:50] that extremely measure maybe they'll follow my orders for a year they'll just live in fear
[00:02:54] but when that opportunity arrives for them to step up and take that power away from you they're
[00:03:01] going to do it so what we see play out and then the other side so now we go to the
[00:03:08] side of okay so I'm going to take care of my people that's what I'm going to do but just like we say
[00:03:15] that doesn't mean we caught a lot of people because if we caught a lot of people then they're
[00:03:19] they're soft and they destroy themselves they they fall apart so and we see that play out
[00:03:28] in the world when a society gets too soft they can no longer survive so even in ancient times
[00:03:37] with conscripts and peasants and serves and slaves if you let things play out the leadership
[00:03:43] principles still actually apply and and then I started thinking about tactics which this is
[00:03:50] another thing that I used to sort of I used to I used to sort of say the same thing about tactics
[00:03:57] which is hey you know the principles on the battlefield they don't change until you go before
[00:04:05] the machine gun right or the at least the gun right because that's that's where you start to talk
[00:04:11] about covered move and that's where it really plays into plays into how you're going to fight
[00:04:17] but then if you adjust your perspective a little bit if we're fighting with spears and we're
[00:04:26] in a failanks guess what I've got my shield I'm holding my shield up it protects the left
[00:04:32] part of my body and it protects the right part of the person to my left and I'm being protected
[00:04:39] covered by the person on my right and what we're going to do is cover for each other as we advance
[00:04:44] with the failanks so we still have to look out for each other teamwork still absolutely applies
[00:04:51] and then I was thinking about the fact that you know here's a here's a military principle
[00:05:02] that I'm just trying to think of things that don't apply right well in modern combat
[00:05:07] we follow rule of dispersion meaning we want to be spread apart we don't want to be too close together
[00:05:13] so that's obviously completely contrary to the idea of being in a failanks where we're
[00:05:17] going to get as close to weekend we're going to keep tight when we move forward but if you change
[00:05:20] your perspective just a little bit you and this is this is one of those doctrinal terms that I was
[00:05:28] able to uncover because of what I used to tell guys is hey if you're alone on the battlefield
[00:05:33] you're going to die if you get too far away from your element the other element you can't support
[00:05:39] each other that's what cover move is so if you're too far away you can't support each other and you
[00:05:44] will get killed because if we're alone we die and that that doctrinal term that when I found it
[00:05:52] I used to get these beautiful satisfaction satisfactory moments in my life where I would have
[00:05:57] an idea and then I would see that it already existed and and that doctrinal term that I would then
[00:06:03] walk around as if I knew it you know as if it was just you know but it's called supporting distance
[00:06:09] so you Dave shouldn't take your squad beyond where my range the web the range of my weapons
[00:06:18] and then when you start to talk about that that means you know communications as well if I don't
[00:06:22] get you know communications with you then I can't support you if my weapons can't reach out and touch
[00:06:27] and give you support then we're not in supporting distance and that's too far away what does that mean
[00:06:31] you just change your perspective a little bit and dispersion which is positive but if you get too far
[00:06:38] apart it's negative so these lessons are the same over time and yet we still have to teach
[00:06:51] because we still make mistakes and when we learn things from a different angle and even reading
[00:06:57] a document yesterday that's thousands or the last podcast that's a document thousands of years old
[00:07:02] you'd think yourself that after thousands of years thousands of years we would be talking about
[00:07:10] these leadership principles in the most commonly known way that everybody just like you know
[00:07:18] I couldn't have written extreme ownership because people would have been just you know saying hey
[00:07:22] no kidding dude what are you talking about this is this is part of the fabric of life
[00:07:27] but these things aren't they're they're not they're not the fabric of life they're they just seem
[00:07:35] to need to be rediscovered over and over again which is which is horrible but one thing I think allows
[00:07:42] us to learn them in a more complete way is seeing them from different angles from other experiences
[00:07:48] and today we're going to take a look at combat lessons which you know and that's the name of the
[00:07:54] document you're you're setting up in a good spot the subtitle it's published in 1944 the subtitle is
[00:08:01] rank and file in combat what they're doing how they are doing it so you know when I see that
[00:08:11] I'm thinking okay we are going to learn something so with that we will bust into this book
[00:08:19] combat lessons number one I've got number two chair will make a pair and send the future
[00:08:28] the introduction of this thing this is one of those things where you get done reading the
[00:08:32] introduction and maybe you don't even have to read anything else because you're just almost there
[00:08:38] introduction the purpose of combat lessons is to give our officers an enlisted men the benefit of
[00:08:44] the battle experiences of others which comes right out of learning you know it says Marine Corps
[00:08:53] to be of maximum benefit these lessons must be disseminated without delay they do not necessarily
[00:08:59] represent the carefully considered views of the war department they do however reflect the actual
[00:09:06] experiences of combat and therefore merit careful merit careful reading for this reason also
[00:09:14] no single issue can cover many of the phases of combat lessons will be drawn from the reports as they
[00:09:21] are received from the theaters of operation and quickly disseminated so that others may apply them
[00:09:26] the suggestions which are made or implied are not intended to change the tactical doctrine
[00:09:31] by which our army has been trained but rather to elaborate their on much of the subject matter
[00:09:38] has been covered in training literature but the comments show that shortcomings continue to
[00:09:44] manifest themselves on the battlefield and then it says this the paramount combat lesson
[00:09:53] learned from every operation is the vital importance of leadership our equipment our supply
[00:10:01] and above all our men are splendid aggressive and determined leadership is the priceless factor
[00:10:10] which inspires a command and upon which all success in battle depends it is responsible for success
[00:10:22] or failure I don't know if I have that thing trademark of leadership is the most important
[00:10:31] thing on the battlefield I don't I don't know if I but I don't know if I could even get a trademark
[00:10:37] right same exact thing same exact thing this is signed by general marshal who's the chief
[00:10:48] staff in the army during World War II he was in World War I first division he was an infantry
[00:10:58] battoon commander in the Philippine American war and he signed in this thing so let's jump into it
[00:11:08] and you're going to see that this is one of the most straightforward documents that built
[00:11:14] well it's straightforward as you can get because all it is basically is quotes from people on the
[00:11:20] front lines that's all this just quotes there's no there's there's there's some little added commentary
[00:11:27] occasionally section one infantry again and again reports from the battlefields confirm the
[00:11:37] importance of leadership in every grade whether it be corporal or kernel hmm other combat lessons are
[00:11:46] important the exercise of leadership in battle is vital leadership has often been defined in theory
[00:11:52] here are some instances of its application or its absence on the battlefield these are
[00:11:58] about a few examples there are many others junior officer in battle captain T captain William T
[00:12:06] Gordon infantry Sicily since November 8th I have had 17 officers in my company
[00:12:14] and I am the only one who started out with it who is left to fight in Tunisia
[00:12:20] the from troops pinned down in the dark I have heard in listed men call out such things as
[00:12:26] where is an officer to lead us we don't want to lie here we want to attack where is an officer
[00:12:35] in each case an officer or officers have risen to the occasion but this never the last shows
[00:12:41] beyond anything else the demand for battle leadership you know it's interesting they've we had a
[00:12:49] redess kind of went off yesterday during EF online talking about the leadership vacuum right
[00:12:57] and knowing when to step up and this is these situations right here you know my immediate
[00:13:05] my immediate thought is if I don't have in listed if I have enlisted people that are calling out you
[00:13:10] know hey where's an officer we want to attack I'm I'm not happy with my training I'm not happy
[00:13:16] with my troops I'm not happy with a job that I did I'm not happy with my performance in
[00:13:20] preparing them for combat because if they need if there's a leadership vacuum and no one
[00:13:24] stepping up they need to step up don't we we had a conversation again that was on EF online yesterday
[00:13:33] where you you just because your in charge doesn't mean you need to talk
[00:13:37] in fact if you don't need to talk then you shouldn't talk if I walk into a room if we're having
[00:13:50] a meeting at echelon front and Jamie our operations director is you know if she's if she's
[00:14:00] putting out the word about what's gonna happen and I go in there and I see that she's got the
[00:14:04] timeline laid out and she told them where's where we need to be at what time and we're getting
[00:14:06] ready for the monster and she's got everything laid out what do I need to say I mean I'm officially
[00:14:12] in charge what do I need to say maybe maybe looks good thank you like maybe so you don't need
[00:14:24] to step up and you know I went into great detail in this and leadership strategy and tactics
[00:14:27] talking about this this leadership vacuum and how it appears sometimes and the real
[00:14:32] nitty gritty techniques that you pay attention to one of the things that you pay attention to is
[00:14:40] if there's a leadership vacuum and no one else knows it they're not ready
[00:14:44] they might not be ready to make it to to follow we know when those there's when they don't sense
[00:14:52] it when they're just kind of sitting oh we're doing okay and you say hey we need to move
[00:14:56] your immediate response might be why wait what are you talking about they haven't
[00:15:01] sensed the leadership vacuum they don't know that there's a problem so sometimes you hesitate
[00:15:05] just a little bit longer let everyone feel that whore feel that lack of leadership and then when
[00:15:13] you step in there with a command boom they're waiting for it they're waiting for it and that is an
[00:15:19] important thing and that's an important it's an important dichotomy I'm sorry I have to say it's
[00:15:25] important dichotomy is that yes there will be many many times when you as a leader don't have to say
[00:15:32] anything and there will be many many times where your team is absolutely waiting and begging
[00:15:41] to be told hey this is what we need to do now
[00:15:45] back to the book a company officer must build a legend about himself he must take calculated
[00:15:57] risks he must on the other hand do what he expects his men to do he must always dig in
[00:16:03] always take cover his men must know that when he ducks they must duck on the other hand they
[00:16:09] must not believe that when the officer ducks they must run away the officer must come through
[00:16:17] every barrage and bombing with a sheepish grin and a rye remark masterly understatement of hardship
[00:16:27] and danger endured plus a grin always pays dividends yeah we got ambushed
[00:16:38] my first deployment to Iraq and I was in vehicle two and the tail end because we were driving
[00:16:45] fast at night and everything and they got and I saw I mean I saw it's getting ambushed but we were
[00:16:50] going fast it was on up we were on a highway south of Baghdad and you know I'm looking at this point
[00:16:58] we were we were we would face not forward we would face out the sides and so you know I see
[00:17:02] RPGs going over and exploding and trace your fire to and from and but then you know what we just
[00:17:11] you know the lead drivers I pushed through push through which was just kind of what we're going to do
[00:17:15] keep going and then the shooting stops and we're still driving and then my my chief who is in the
[00:17:25] rear vehicle which is purposely set up that way because that way if you have to reverse you've got
[00:17:29] you know your lead your your your most senior leader in listed leaders in the back he's going to
[00:17:34] take and also if something goes wrong he's going to assess so he's back there and you know he says
[00:17:42] he's they got they got you know those RPGs were close the lock close to him that they were to me
[00:17:47] he comes up he's like hey start which you know first of all he rarely would call me sir you know
[00:17:52] but he's like hey sir you know we got ambushed back here and I could hear his voice he's a little freaked out
[00:17:58] and I waited a solid you know like 10 seconds and then I came up and said Roger
[00:18:07] now what's it you know that was we got down to where we were going all like oh Roger you know
[00:18:12] so yeah I like this thing of you know hey just a little grin a rye remark
[00:18:20] would be good it's kind of like when your kid falls down yes exactly like when your kid falls down
[00:18:25] and then he looks at you kind of like what are we doing here we crying we whatever and then yeah
[00:18:30] you know no big deal kind of a thing we're laughing yeah we're laughing you know I used to say like oh
[00:18:36] that was awesome nice yeah you're out this j-how you're lag it's going to bleed
[00:18:44] yeah my kid came home yesterday just blood everywhere he hit the reef you were so proud
[00:18:57] yeah no it's just you know he's just covered in blood and like yeah I'll re-forget you yeah
[00:19:04] for sure the barnacles what it is out here in California the the reefs are just rock it's not
[00:19:09] coral like you always hear about the coral reefs with the razors this is just rocks but they
[00:19:14] have barnacles on it if you go touch a barnacle they're sharp and if you fall and you scrape
[00:19:19] against them you're getting cut open you're gonna be bleeding everywhere but do not come into the
[00:19:23] house with the blood is the main level of the story get the hose get take care of business
[00:19:30] next section this is an interesting one and this really shows you
[00:19:36] this is one of those things where you think you know the world is different this was a different time
[00:19:45] this section says hate your enemy our men do not ordinarily hate they must hate
[00:19:55] they are better soldiers when they hate they must not frat nice with prisoners must not give them
[00:20:01] cigarettes and food the moment they are taken hate can be taught men by meticulous example
[00:20:09] the Rangers are so taught that's a different world but yeah that is not in any modern army
[00:20:19] publications and then you think about you know world war two you think about what those guys
[00:20:28] were going into you think about what you had to get but the mindset you had to bring out in people
[00:20:34] when they were in a landing craft and they were gonna go land on tarua or iwo jima or normandy
[00:20:43] you got a you got a dig deep it's an interesting it's an interesting comment
[00:20:49] where we are we're at total war just so everyone doesn't freak out this isn't taught anymore
[00:21:00] and i will say this it's not taught anymore right now but we better remember this
[00:21:07] because if the world we could get to a place where this is needed again i'm sorry to report
[00:21:15] what i hope you don't i hope we can always be going into wars saying yeah it's a small element of
[00:21:21] people and they've got some bad feelings and they've got some reasons for their their
[00:21:28] anger towards us but we need to go and show them that we're a benevolent group and we can help them
[00:21:33] move on those are all that's great hopefully we fight wars like that hopefully we won't have to
[00:21:38] fight anymore wars where the doctrine is being adjusted to get us to hate our enemy
[00:21:52] next one leaders in front
[00:21:56] staff sergeant Richard E. Deeland infantry Sicily we want our captains out front
[00:22:03] we don't much care about the position of our battalion commander that's it that's all that's
[00:22:08] a whole note keep them moving
[00:22:17] operation report seven tharmysicely during an attack officers and noncommission officers must
[00:22:21] never allow men to lie prone and and passive under enemy fire they must be required to move
[00:22:28] forward if this is at all possible if movement is absolutely impossible have the troops at least
[00:22:35] open fire the act of firing induces self confidence in attacking troops the familiar expression
[00:22:45] dig or die has been greatly overworked attacking troops must not be allowed to dig in until they have
[00:22:53] secured their final objective if they dig in when momentarily stopped by enemy fire it will take
[00:23:00] dynamite to blast them from their holes and resume the advance this is another thing and we're
[00:23:07] going to get into some of this there's another element again where you get to total war
[00:23:16] and and that's what that's what that's what that's what these things are leaning towards we're
[00:23:19] in a totally different situation you know this is this is an existential war where if we don't win
[00:23:25] America's not going to exist freedom will not exist in the world
[00:23:33] nco leadership staff sergeant Robert J. Camp platoon sergeant infantry Sicily
[00:23:39] nco leadership is important leaders nco's an officer should be taken to an OP for terrain instruction
[00:23:46] and study before an attack this has been possible in my outfit about one fourth of the time we have
[00:23:52] what is called an orders group which consists of that group of officers and nco's that must
[00:23:57] be assembled for instruction before any tactical move simple clear concise orders get people together
[00:24:04] get face to face with them look at the terrain show them what they're seeing show them where they're
[00:24:10] going to move to and this seems real obvious and yet this guy is saying hey you better do it
[00:24:26] keep your mission in mind Colonel eb fayer field artillery observer with fifth army
[00:24:32] Italy difficulty was experienced in making patrol leaders realized the importance of bringing back
[00:24:39] information by a specified hour in time to be a value patrols often returned after encountering
[00:24:44] resistance without accomplishing their mission sending them back to accomplish their mission
[00:24:50] despite their fatigue seem to be the most effective solution to the training problem involved
[00:24:55] although the information required often arrived to late and then this other guy says this is
[00:25:03] Lieutenant Colonel TF Bogart infantry and if actually Dave I know you haven't heard this yet
[00:25:10] I went on kind of a massive tangent the other day on the last podcast about
[00:25:16] seeing some of the seal machine gunners and just how entuned they were with their weapons and
[00:25:24] the great lengths that they would go to develop their own personal individual standard operating
[00:25:31] procedures so that they're working that thing like a pain or works a brush and just I said if
[00:25:40] if I could take videos and there's two guys in particular that that I was actually went through
[00:25:44] seal training with both of them and then I ended up in Patons with them at seal team one back in the
[00:25:49] day and if I had videos of them assaulting through targets with their M60 machine guns and the
[00:25:58] the the incredible smoothness which which they would handle the weapon and open up the feed tray
[00:26:07] and slap out extra links and pull out the new belt and slap feet just it would look beautiful
[00:26:13] and I was like that if if we could if you could post those videos no one would want to go to
[00:26:17] war with America they know people like that are out there and it's not and obviously it's not just
[00:26:22] seal machineners it's like every it's like there is a pocket of every every sector of the military
[00:26:29] where there are people that is what they are doing that's who they are yeah there's there's a
[00:26:37] version of that in everything for the people that they kind of fall in love with what they're doing
[00:26:43] and when they just fall in love with whatever their job is I would just kind of remarking as you
[00:26:48] go through these they're said in a way that I can't think of anything else to say other than
[00:26:53] yeah yeah do that that's really good and that the way he said is is is right and I'm kind
[00:26:58] of rocking my brain like how can I create some context around this like no that's that's it that's
[00:27:02] pretty good so I think I'm just going to sit here for the next hour listen to you just repeat
[00:27:07] with these guys have said but I mean the thing that's crazy about it is they seem so obvious and
[00:27:12] that's like you said earlier is in some ways it's a little bit disheartening at how often
[00:27:17] they need to be repeated because the way they're saying it isn't really that complex like man that's
[00:27:23] that's as clear as anybody could say it do you think you take a statement and this goes back
[00:27:30] to what we were talking about as far as I'm a leader if I walk into a room and I sit through the
[00:27:34] brief enough and needs to be said I'm not going to say anything if someone takes of something like
[00:27:41] a fundamental principle of combat cover move right and they say okay but I'm going to be
[00:27:46] expanding on that a little bit and then they expand on it and then someone else expands on that
[00:27:51] expansion then someone else expands on that expansion and the next thing you know you don't even you
[00:27:56] can't you can't see cover move anymore become something else for sure that the the the the the
[00:28:03] complex of those things that's I think why these things are so powerful I was even right now
[00:28:07] the little notes to myself of what was my version of what you were just saying I wrote down like
[00:28:12] we we had the phrase mutual support that's what we called it in an airplanes we had to apply
[00:28:17] mutual support to each other it's cover move 100 just cover move it's all it is and
[00:28:22] technology is sort of redefined where we would need to be to apply that mutual support
[00:28:30] but the principle hasn't changed but if you're not carefully to get two wrapped up around this
[00:28:34] piece of technology allows me to get to this range over time you lose the idea that all that really
[00:28:39] matters is that you and I work closely enough together that I can cover you and you can cover me
[00:28:44] and those roles will go back and forth in some sort of unknown it's not predetermined it's just
[00:28:49] gonna happen and the better we are the more naturally it happens but all it is is mutual support
[00:28:53] and I remember sitting and breathing like hang on are you just saying you want me to say a
[00:28:56] certain distance away from you so I can help you with it and when we interact with other aircraft
[00:29:00] hey just say that and if I it's trading too because if I get it wrong we can just come back and
[00:29:05] debrief it it's okay but you have spent like nine minutes talking about the nuances of that
[00:29:09] when there's no way to predict and I've lost sight of what you're really trying to tell me which is
[00:29:12] don't get too far away man check the that just made me think I was up with an air wing in
[00:29:20] Fallen and I remember I don't even this is this is definitely one of my early sort of
[00:29:27] grasping of the idea of cover move was we would put a squad on the ground and when we get
[00:29:37] extracted when we put on the ground or we get extracted I remember briefing the helicopter
[00:29:42] pilots and I don't know if I learned it from them or I don't know but I remember saying hey
[00:29:47] and I actually have I have a book that I wrote I have a book that I wrote when I was at
[00:29:52] Seal team when I was a communicator it's called communications and a lot of it I wrote it
[00:29:58] with a body of mine who is another communicator and he wrote a lot of this technical stuff about
[00:30:04] how to operate each individual radio and I just wrote my section I mean I helped him a little bit
[00:30:11] with that very little because he was smarter than me than so he wrote you know how to do the
[00:30:16] little things but I wrote all this stuff about hey when you're calling in a helicopter here's
[00:30:22] what you need to do and I'm going to find this because I have this book I have it and one of the
[00:30:28] things I said was leave one helicopter at altitude to provide cover fire for the helicopter that's
[00:30:34] on the ground and here I was a new guy kind of thinking that I had a little something you know
[00:30:40] had a little something for these guys and that's one of the initial kind of thoughts around or
[00:30:45] me starting to realize that cover move wasn't just that that really was the fundamental of everything
[00:30:51] that we were doing and the other thing that I scratched down when when I talk about people you're
[00:30:58] talking about people being really good at their jobs I was doing some kind of an exercise at the
[00:31:02] camp Pendleton and somehow we got linked into a mortar a Marine Corps mortar element and
[00:31:09] bro these guys were doing Iads immediate action drills with their mortars and you know I just
[00:31:18] remember watching them and I don't know what I don't know how you put words I don't know what you
[00:31:26] know they were you know they're freaking 18 years old and they hear you know contact right
[00:31:32] and then boom a guy's slapping down the base plate the guy's perfect as they're
[00:31:36] spitting on because they're doing a boom and they're getting rounds out like in so fast I don't know how
[00:31:42] fast it was but so fast accurate rounds and then immediately correcting bracketing and they're good
[00:31:48] and they're on target and you just think you know what we're good America's good
[00:31:57] alright Lieutenant Colonel TF Boger greater emphasis must be placed on
[00:32:03] inculcating in junior officers and NCOs the will to accomplish assigned missions despite opposition
[00:32:11] a few accounts of patrol actions illustrate this point and he goes through these a
[00:32:15] reconnaissance patrol consisting of a platoon who sent out about 1900 one evening to determine the
[00:32:19] strength of any if any of Germans in two small towns the first about two miles away and the second
[00:32:24] about three miles farther on the patrol reached the outskirts of the first town in Metton the
[00:32:28] town in who told them there were no Germans in the town and then started to lead the patrol
[00:32:32] in to town a few hundred yards further farther a German machine gun opened up the Italian
[00:32:37] disappeared three of the patrol were killed and the others dispersed they drifted back to
[00:32:40] our battalion during the night and it was not until nearly daylight that the practically
[00:32:46] valueless report of action was received not the slightest conception of the strength of the
[00:32:51] first town was obtained and no information of the second town it was necessary to send out another
[00:32:57] patrol with the same mission so that's that's number one and again I think this is this is just
[00:33:05] shows you that this is a different time and they're like hey you took some casualties you got three
[00:33:09] guys killed you it doesn't matter you got it you still got to go figure out what the strength was
[00:33:13] in there obviously got some Germans in there and by the way there's another town two miles away
[00:33:16] you need to go get on that too that is not a consistent attitude with the current
[00:33:21] operations right where you go oh yeah we took three casualties but we're continuing down here
[00:33:27] on this reconnaissance mission by the way freaking legit two a patrol sent out with the mission
[00:33:33] of determining the condition of a road especially bridges over a three mile stretch to the front
[00:33:38] when this patrol had covered about a mile at ran into a motorized German patrol two the Americans
[00:33:42] were killed and the patoon leader claimed six Germans the patrol leader forgot his mission
[00:33:47] returned to the paty on cp with the remainder of his patrol and had to be sent out again with a
[00:33:51] great loss in time getting the information desired this dude's out there gets into contact with a
[00:33:57] motorized German patrol has two guys killed killed six Germans comes back to base he's probably
[00:34:03] totally amped and feeling like he did a great job and they say hey did you complete your mission?
[00:34:09] no oh Roger that go back out these are hard men yeah last one on several occasions patrols
[00:34:18] were sent out on reconnaissance missions with instruction to get certain information by a specific time
[00:34:22] the hour would pass and sometimes several others without a word from the patrol sometimes it was
[00:34:26] due to difficulties encountered sometimes to mistakes and computation of time and space
[00:34:30] factors but in all cases there was no good reason why some information didn't get back by the
[00:34:36] specified time and here's I said there was some occasional comments amplifying information so
[00:34:47] here's the comment comment the failure of patrols in these instances stems from a lack of
[00:34:52] appreciation on the part of NCOs and junior officers of their missions in patrol actions as in
[00:35:00] the operations of larger units the mission must be kept upper most in the minds of all ranks
[00:35:05] and no action should be undertaken which does not contribute directly to the accomplishment of that mission
[00:35:13] conversely no incidental or inadvertent contact with the enemy should deter or divert patrols
[00:35:20] from the complete accomplishment of their missions to include compliance with all instructions given
[00:35:25] where humanly possible these guys are freaking just legit that's because this is total war yeah
[00:35:34] that's because this is an existential war there's there's so much insulation that we
[00:35:42] we sometimes try to create and I remember feeling it on my deployment to Ramadad which is
[00:35:46] very different than my deployments in an aircraft and I even remember feeling the sense of wanting
[00:35:52] to insulate my own family from what I was doing that feeling of just wanting to keep them insulated
[00:35:56] from the reality when I see all that did to balance with from my wife is made it made it kind of
[00:36:02] worse because she had to create something in her mind and she had to try to piece it together
[00:36:06] which she simply couldn't do but that need to insulate if that ends up on the inside with your own
[00:36:12] folks and that becomes most obvious when you start losing people and the question of hey how
[00:36:19] much time are we gonna take how much downtime are we gonna take and I'm listening to this
[00:36:26] and it's like that's not even a there's not we're not even that conversation isn't even happening
[00:36:31] we're not we're not talking about hey what are we gonna do to acknowledge what has happened here
[00:36:36] which of course you want to do but this is not an option and the leadership isn't even
[00:36:42] conflent that that's funny the way he said that my mind immediately went like I want to write that
[00:36:46] differently instead of these staff and CEOs and the junior officers not understanding it it's
[00:36:50] the leadership has failed to explain to them the context that they should understand and we actually
[00:36:56] aren't doing our jobs I might have got ahead of myself it looks like you're laughing something
[00:37:01] I'm laughing even when he said that it was like no that's not what happened
[00:37:05] yeah I'm laughing because you can see my note right there says ownership question mark
[00:37:09] exact same thing is you know when when you blame your NCOs and your junior officers
[00:37:15] because they don't appreciate their mission yeah they don't understand it
[00:37:19] well guess what who's fault is that all day long it's my fault as a leader for letting those
[00:37:23] junior officers go out there and I'm not sitting over here trying to pick apart the things they're
[00:37:26] saying I'm just picturing every time every time I placed a demand on guys on my team that the
[00:37:32] understood it wasn't even hard for them to step up I mean it was a challenging situation but
[00:37:37] if they understand why we were just stepping up and making things happen when it was hard no
[00:37:40] factor my 18-year-old Marines were gone no factor but if I failed to give them that and then
[00:37:47] something difficult happened that created some friction and some some doubt that was a much
[00:37:51] harder problem to get past if they didn't understand why they needed to get past it and that was
[00:37:55] always always on me always I or it was on the 18-year-old kid on his very first deployment
[00:38:02] that one of his closest friends had just gotten killed it's either on him or it's on me it
[00:38:06] is not even hard but if you gave him that context what they could overcome an endure
[00:38:12] I don't mean to say that it wasn't hard maybe that's the wrong way to describe it but boy they
[00:38:15] did it every single time without hesitation yeah that's that's the whole US military even though
[00:38:20] you know as I read this in like man these guys were hard but that's what we do in the military you
[00:38:26] take casualties and then you you go you go do your job that's what you do
[00:38:38] next one team up captain William T Gordon infantry Sicily I have found that men in position must
[00:38:43] fight in pairs and order that 50% stay awake is thus easily enforced it bolsters morale
[00:38:50] and nerves rally point in every company attack order a reserve force must be prescribed
[00:38:57] I always do even though sometimes this force consists only of myself and my first sergeant
[00:39:04] often a soldier who a moment before is runaway is converted to a fighter by leadership a reserve
[00:39:09] force gives him a rallying point that's brilliant just having a fallback point even if it's two
[00:39:15] people hey if you got to run away run to here and then who's there the platoon commander in the first
[00:39:20] sergeant like all right buddy here takes a memo get ready because we're gonna rock and roll
[00:39:28] fear is normal Colonel George Taylor infantry Sicily fear of being afraid is the greatest
[00:39:36] obstacle for the new man in battle to overcome there is no reason for shame in being afraid
[00:39:42] men who have had excellent battle records freely admit they are scared stiff and battle
[00:39:47] the important thing is that every soldier must be taught all he needs to know so well that
[00:39:54] battlefield thinking is reduced to a minimum automatic disciplined reactions to battlefield
[00:40:00] problems must be the rule in battle the worst element is mental and nervous exhaustion
[00:40:09] there is no real rest under fire the ability to withstand fire is more important than all the
[00:40:15] knowledge in the world what are you writing down nervous exhaustion yeah the idea that you will
[00:40:26] exhaust yourself and render yourself incapable just by creating the fear in your mind
[00:40:33] but when you don't react what's going you just you and you just I've seen it where people get
[00:40:37] overwhelmed by the moment and they end up doing nothing and they literally exhaust themselves
[00:40:42] in in their own minds by being afraid of what's out there rather than just facing what's out there
[00:40:48] which is extremely hard to do but just the way he wrote that that nervous exhaustion such an
[00:40:54] awesome way to describe what sometimes people do when they're just freaking out of what's happening
[00:40:59] they exhaust themselves into doing nothing I got more than a couple times and
[00:41:07] actually my platoon of my first deployment we went to this outstation it was a special forces
[00:41:14] outstation it was in a rough neighborhood in Baghdad and we got murdered a decent amount that night
[00:41:20] and like the next day let me rephrase that we probably got hit with an Rpg or two
[00:41:30] maybe a rifle fired grenade and then I don't know some number of mortars more than
[00:41:44] more than three or four like this decent right which by the way when you compare to this is just
[00:41:53] nothing it's just nothing and the reason I bring it up because even that one night you know one night
[00:41:59] of receiving some pretty consistent mortar fire was enough that you could see the next day
[00:42:05] guys were on edge guys were legitimately on edge after one night of light mortar attacks
[00:42:15] and that's just crazy and you could see that over time it's what we see in World War One you know
[00:42:23] those awful videos of World War One of guys that had shell shock legit shell shock
[00:42:28] and when we when we covered shot it dawn on here you know you break down people break down
[00:42:35] and it doesn't matter what you say what you do you're telling them you're gonna shoot them if they
[00:42:39] if they deserve and they do it anyways so the ability to withstand fires more important than
[00:42:46] all the knowledge in the world I'll tell you something else I think the ability to withstand fire
[00:42:55] is related to an acceptance of death I mean if you are if you are scared of dying this is going
[00:43:09] to drive you insane yeah I think that's the nervous exhaustion right there you're gonna go insane
[00:43:14] if that's what you think about look man when I got when I got to Ramadi I was afraid of dying
[00:43:23] for a very brief period of time but I was I got there and I I remember I wrote about and
[00:43:30] I remember realizing as I probably was there for you know a little bit I had in some ways the
[00:43:36] benefit of knowing people that had been there knowing knowing what I was going to get myself into
[00:43:39] but when I got there I'm like oh man I'm here now and I remember thinking for a little while like
[00:43:44] oh this maybe maybe this is a bad idea maybe this is a mistake and there was a little bit of fear of dying
[00:43:53] and the time that I spent thinking about that was it was it was exhausting and then
[00:44:01] I you know what yes that might happen I literally considered to myself yep that might happen
[00:44:07] and I got past it and that was the end of it I never lost the idea that it could happen I fully
[00:44:11] understood that but I sort of just stopped thinking about it I didn't stop thinking about it because I
[00:44:15] didn't think it would happen I just stopped thinking about it because it was a kind of a useless
[00:44:19] thing to think about anymore but if you get trapped in that and I remember a small period of time
[00:44:23] of that feeling of like the paranoia that starts to build up of what you can end up creating
[00:44:28] is that you're going to die there's no way to get out of it and that becomes the obsession that you
[00:44:33] think about if you're going to go to combat you have to accept that that might happen and then you
[00:44:38] have to get past that and then go do whatever it is you're going to go do knowing that's a case
[00:44:42] without letting it control you at all but again what I was going to face in my brush with war compared
[00:44:50] to any of this other stuff is kind of crazy yeah there's another end of the spectrum too and I
[00:44:56] think I kind of went back and forth between two mindsets of one is you know what I can I can
[00:45:05] die that'll that could happen tonight and you know what I'm not going to die if it's not going to happen
[00:45:09] but you know whatever watch this I'll stand out here in the street doesn't matter they can't kill me
[00:45:16] I mean in my first deployment to Iraq what did I write on my Humvee door once we got the
[00:45:27] we welded steel steel on there I think I think I wrote I cannot be killed on it
[00:45:34] and my guys made me take it off they were so freaked out they're like oh don't do that man
[00:45:41] that's a total of jakes don't do it don't do it so and you know even talking to Dean Latt
[00:45:47] Dean Latt you know going into Taroa it's like oh did you think you were going to get killed and he's like
[00:45:53] no of course not what do you think about week yeah and that might be the greatest story of all time
[00:46:00] when his buddy went he pretended like he was dying his buddy pretend like he was dying and
[00:46:06] had his his friend the the chaplain come over and he was reading in this last right and then he
[00:46:12] starts laughing all right next section is about Sicily Italy and act too
[00:46:21] night attacks and they they get into attu which is that the battle up on the illusion island
[00:46:31] the island of a two two thousand nine hundred Japanese soldiers
[00:46:37] two thousand eight hundred and seventy two of them killed 28 captured surprise saves lives
[00:46:51] major John R. Patterson infantry Sicily the mission of our battalion after landing
[00:46:57] itself south of Gala in Sicily was to capture the airport at Biscari the battalion used the
[00:47:06] silent night attack three rifle companies were in line with heavy machine heavy weapons company
[00:47:11] in reserve to reach its line of departure the battalion crossed two ridges using control two control
[00:47:17] lines then climb the cliff at the airport to the light of departure all this was done silently
[00:47:21] under the cover of darkness the attack was started with a hand grenade we didn't fire until the
[00:47:26] Germans counterattack when we went with we went in with bayonets and hand grenades and caught some
[00:47:33] of the Germans undressing and dressing the tanks fired their guns but wouldn't close on us
[00:47:39] the enemy knew their men were all about so they fired their machine guns and rifles
[00:47:44] mainly into the air our attack lasted about 30 minutes we had no casualties during the attack
[00:47:54] two were killed during the counter attacks so that that that silent option I was do we were doing
[00:48:02] training I was at team two I was an assistant platoon commander they captured one of our
[00:48:08] seals they had him up and this is an urban combat training they had him up in the third floor of
[00:48:14] this building and they're telling you know yelling scream and so he's up there they're going to kill
[00:48:19] me and all this and they're waiting for us and they're waiting for us to do what we do which is
[00:48:23] you know and on the first floor clear the first floor moved the second floor moved the third floor
[00:48:27] clear the foot forget the rumor he is and I'm like you know silence we patrolled out we took the
[00:48:35] fire escape up directly to the third floor didn't clear any of the other rooms and went right
[00:48:40] into where because we could see where he was we could hear where he was so we knew he isn't like one
[00:48:43] of one or two or three rooms and we caught those those up four guys completely off guard they're
[00:48:50] they're they're literally looking out the windows trying to see where we were and we walked in
[00:48:55] shot them all in the back rescued our guy but the what's important here is any goes into like a
[00:49:04] little bit a little bit more detail but you because we're being quiet you have to have good
[00:49:10] control lines of where you're going to let people get to hand the hand fighting
[00:49:18] Captain Gerald infantry at Biscari airport I used my trench knife twice one of my man got three
[00:49:27] with his bayonet he shot one then another tried to grab his bayonet he got this one with his bayonet
[00:49:33] that got him started so he got three in before it was all over
[00:49:36] small arms against arm we found that the the 30 caliber AP pierces enemy armored
[00:49:51] half tracks at close ranges that's something that everybody should know
[00:49:59] put to an action lieutenant hallrich infantry when the enemy machine guns opened up with
[00:50:04] three grenades the machine guns pulled back out of grenade fire then NCOs and Browning
[00:50:11] automatic riflemen went up over the embankment through and beyond the initial enemy positions
[00:50:15] eventually we had a base of fire about 20 men including the bars the BARs during the enemy counter
[00:50:22] attacks we did pretty well with other fire two led was flying fast and fiercely at 20 to 30 yards
[00:50:28] we fire at flashes in this kind of firing you learn to fire and roll to one side or they will
[00:50:34] soon get you I read the whole thing just to get that last little part if you're trooper out there
[00:50:39] if you're in the military you shoot and then you move because if you pop your head up again in
[00:50:45] that same spot you're going to take one
[00:50:47] common in all these accounts of a successful night attack by a small unit the application
[00:50:58] of the following principles is worthy of note close control during the approach by the use of
[00:51:03] control lines adjusted to difficult terrain features designation of a line of departure as close
[00:51:09] to the objective as possible and after all major terrain obstacles have been passed this is a
[00:51:17] essential to assure proper organization of the unit immediately prior to the so you can
[00:51:21] to apply that right there so many business things right there like you get everything ready to go
[00:51:26] you get past all the main obstacles once everyone's passed the main obstacles then you execute
[00:51:31] attainment of the vital surprise use of the bayonet and hand grenades with no weapon firing
[00:51:38] permitted it may often be advisable to prohibit the loading of rifles and for anyone that doesn't
[00:51:43] understand why these guys are talking about using grenades so much grenades do not give away your
[00:51:47] position neither do bayonets so you can hug grenades and no one knows where it just came from there's
[00:51:52] no one to shoot at there's no muscle flush and so it's a great weapon when you are attacking from
[00:51:58] like a clandestine situation where you don't want the enemy to know where you are you so front
[00:52:05] of attack only any attempt at development tends to cause disorder and confusion note that one
[00:52:11] puttune which had advanced ahead of the general lines was pulled back to conform so they're saying
[00:52:17] frontal attack only and what they're saying is don't try and surround because if you try and
[00:52:22] surround people at night and you're gonna end up on opposite sides and you're gonna end up in a
[00:52:25] blue on blue situation I don't think that they mean don't set up flank situations
[00:52:35] a definite and limited objective capture of an airfield in this case in which the entire front
[00:52:40] could be covered by manpower rather than firepower all that's good these are the major elements
[00:52:45] of successful night attack brought out in the foregoing account others not mentioned but which
[00:52:49] were undoubtedly contributing contributing factors of the operation are careful planning in my new
[00:52:55] detail precise specific orders careful arrangement for maintenance of direction throw daylight
[00:53:02] reconnaissance by as many of the leaders as possible use of compound use of compact columns
[00:53:08] in the approach so the reason that they're saying precise specific orders that's different
[00:53:12] that's different than what we normally talk about the reason is because you are attempting to
[00:53:17] make this happen without having the enemy get a vote so once the enemy gets a vote if you
[00:53:25] two specific things change now we don't know what to do but we are setting this thing up to be
[00:53:30] very specific and we should be able to get to our last point of concealment we should be in our
[00:53:36] positions everything should be good once that attack starts you know you still want to keep them
[00:53:42] constrained because it's nighttime yeah the context of the night pieces also I think really
[00:53:49] important because it seems what he's what they're saying is that there's a lot more close control
[00:53:54] under a night attack requires a whole lot of things because when the chaos ensues under an attack
[00:53:59] you were denied something that you usually rely on so heavily and when you were reading that
[00:54:06] and again it's under the context of a night assault it's different it's different at night
[00:54:11] you told a story long time ago that I've used a bunch and there's a version of it I have from
[00:54:15] flying which was when we started using NVG's the way we described the use of NVG's why we would use
[00:54:22] NVG's in airplane is the most simplest way to describe it is it allows us to use daytime tactics
[00:54:29] at night which before you just couldn't do you actually you want the least amount of
[00:54:34] close control is possible you need to have some but in the day you don't need it as much because
[00:54:38] you can rely on being able to see each other and when you started to see people like reject the idea
[00:54:44] of things that allowed you to maneuver in different ways using technology because why would I do
[00:54:50] it like that the night creates an environment that's really hard to operate in and if you're going to
[00:54:58] be successful at night you have to do a lot more things than you would normally do during the day which
[00:55:02] is why some of the technology pieces are so nice to allow you to do it but even with that you can't
[00:55:07] pretend like the two are the same and the detail is going through I'm all thinking like yeah you
[00:55:12] wouldn't do that during the day you have to do that at night yeah yeah and now that we're talking
[00:55:16] about it when you're talking about this size element because I'm saying hey you could still set up
[00:55:21] flanks but if it's nighttime you got a big element I actually wouldn't I would set up a complete
[00:55:26] online assault we would all be together we would all be within you know communication distance
[00:55:31] and we're going to not make those mistakes and we're going to know where everyone is because
[00:55:35] when you're online you've got free fire and eight or at in 180 degrees ahead of you it's an
[00:55:41] awesome thing that's going to that's going to that's going to overwhelm or make the idea of having
[00:55:50] another element on the flank obsolete because you're firepower so unrestricted when you're online
[00:55:57] and that's you know it's like you can either solve online or you can set up an al that's it
[00:56:01] and then there's these little other variations where you can start to develop an
[00:56:04] development is very very dangerous and you better have some serious control measures in place if
[00:56:10] you're going to try that very serious control measures including up to an including pieces of
[00:56:15] terrain that actually prevent you from having a blue on blue because there's a freaking mountain
[00:56:21] or a ravine or whatever that prevents you from getting shot by your own guys.
[00:56:31] All right this this little section here starts to jump into really specific stuff knocking out
[00:56:36] pill boxes and then it gets into individual initiative. The following cases of individual initiative
[00:56:46] and heroism during the Soleno landing were reported by the infantry.
[00:56:55] Sergeant Manuel Gonzalez upon landing discovered the position of a German 88 in the sand dunes near
[00:57:01] the beach this gun was firing on the assault boats as they landed the sergeant crept around the position
[00:57:07] under machine gun fire which said is pack on fire and despite the hand grenades being thrown at him
[00:57:14] he then calmly tossed several hand grenades into a gun placement killing the crew and blowing up their ammunition
[00:57:23] yeah you're going to see each one of these these these are talking about individual initiative what they are is just
[00:57:30] just pure heroics. Sergeant John Y McGill jumped on an enemy tank and dropped the hand grenade
[00:57:38] into the open turret killing the crew private Clayton I Tallman on hill 424 observed that the
[00:57:44] enemy was attempting an development of the left flank of his company taking up a better position
[00:57:50] he killed an enemy machine gun crew with three carefully aimed shots in a few minutes he repeated
[00:57:55] the same action when another enemy machine gun crew appeared he alone protected the left flank of
[00:57:59] the company until the rest of the platoon arrived private barel b right discovered that he and a group of
[00:58:09] five men have been cut off from his company he immediately organized them into a defensive position on a
[00:58:14] small no they repuls three rushes by the enemy who were attempting to establish machine gun
[00:58:18] positions on the flank private right was completely in command of the situation giving orders and
[00:58:23] shouting encouragement yeah I was going off on that last podcast about having team members that
[00:58:32] are going to step up and just make things happen. Staff Sergeant Quillin H McGmitchen was shot in
[00:58:42] the chest and shoulder and shoulder before his assault boat reached the shore I say that again shot
[00:58:49] in the chest and shoulder before he reaches the shore have you read a shoulder injury echo Charles
[00:58:56] yes yeah we were like ah you know I really can't do anything right or you hurt you know you get
[00:59:02] somebody with that poles that are pack muscle or whatever yeah what do they do for the next six months
[00:59:07] say they they sit around and drink warm milk what does it mention do well when the boat
[00:59:13] reached the beach the landing ramp stuck and would not drop the sergeant despite his wounds
[00:59:17] kicked the ramp loose and then let his section ashore continuing to wreck their operations
[00:59:22] until he received a fatal shot from enemy gunfire. Pre assault you get shot in the chest and
[00:59:34] shoulder when you get shot in the shoulder you're not using that arm and then you get shot in the
[00:59:39] chest as well arm and moved ahead in the face of the intense fire and cleared the beach as
[00:59:49] soon as possible lieutenant carry soon after reaching the shore was fired upon by three Germans
[00:59:53] armed with machine pistols he returned fire but his car being jammed after killing one of the
[00:59:58] of his adversaries he then grasped his weapon as a club and advancing in the face of their fire
[01:00:07] clubbed the second then he physically tackled subdued and disarmed the third German taking him prisoner
[01:00:22] the ability the individual soldier to grasp the implications of the situation and take the necessary
[01:00:28] action should be fully exploited the results of combat are the fruits of combined efforts of
[01:00:35] individuals every soldier should be indoctrinated with the idea that his individual action
[01:00:42] may be the decisive factor in the final result
[01:00:51] leader substrategy in tactic every guy in the cartoon is the most important guy
[01:00:54] true statement true statement that that comment is so I mean it is so powerful that they can
[01:01:05] that they understand that what they do individually can change the entire outcome of the entire
[01:01:13] operation and what's crazy when I'm listening to these these stories of just like you described
[01:01:18] just total acts of heroism they called it initiative and heroly what's crazy about that is for
[01:01:24] the ones that have ended up metal of honor or these ones that end up telling their stories
[01:01:28] they all say the exact same thing and I'm paraphrasing but they all say I don't feel like a hero
[01:01:34] I just doing my job that's what they all say they just have this simple way of describing
[01:01:39] I wasn't doing it to be a hero I needed to take out that machine gunest
[01:01:44] Tom five's like I didn't think of it in like any heroic I needed to blow up that tank so I got out of
[01:01:50] the tank and took her and they downplay it so much that when you're listening to your kind of
[01:01:55] just an all like bro are you kidding me you're a total hero but they never see it like that there's
[01:02:00] like I had to do this my men need me to do this so I just didn't the last thing I was thinking
[01:02:05] about was the right up that I was going to get if I attacked this position and they do things
[01:02:10] that just seem completely superhuman and the way they able to do that is they understand
[01:02:14] that what they do has huge impact on the people around them which is crazy you can teach that
[01:02:19] to a human being yeah imagine if you had a company where every single person inside your company
[01:02:24] thought that each individual action that they had would have an impact on the entire company as a whole
[01:02:30] what if you could indoctrinate and inculcate that idea into your team imagine what that team would be like
[01:02:38] action on actu operations report regimen will combat team to fight the japs in this in this
[01:02:50] country our troops must stick to high ground and not only outflank but out altitude the enemy
[01:02:59] the high ground continuous movement is necessary to keep the spark in an attack
[01:03:04] if a machine gun covers one point then a group not at that point must continue to advance
[01:03:13] when fire is shifted the original group must move even if the platoon is entirely halted
[01:03:20] by the fire of enemy guns then the commitment of additional troop results whereas by proper coordination
[01:03:28] some portion of the platoon can be kept moving and the force committed kept to a minimum that's
[01:03:36] his number one thing is covered move the tendency of lower commanders to commit reserves to early must be
[01:03:46] curved security cannot be over emphasized any movement or group on the battlefield even in a rear
[01:03:53] areas is subject to enemy action in this connection consideration must be given to the protection
[01:03:59] of medical installation at present these are left unprotected without even individual arms for
[01:04:04] the personnel in the event of enemy penetration through our frontline positions it is practically
[01:04:09] certain that these installations will be hit why are they given that lessons because that's exactly
[01:04:13] what happened on like a suicide attack from the japanese aggressive patrolling particularly to maintain
[01:04:19] active content contact is a vital importance it can mean the difference between defeat and victory
[01:04:25] however mere numbers of patrols will not solve the problem special training in patrolling in
[01:04:31] organizing patrols must be initiated commanders must plan to have reasonably fresh men
[01:04:38] available for night contact it is vital to organize patrol activity carefully to ensure that
[01:04:44] all lines are familiar with the roots returning of returning patrols so that the danger of mistaken
[01:04:49] identity in the darkest will be minimized yeah they got the the the japanese on their attack
[01:04:57] made it they broke through and it was fighting in the rear lieutenant general Simon B. Buckner
[01:05:06] commanding general asking department it was apparent that the enemy was particularly vulnerable to
[01:05:11] attack by units of our infantry which pushed forward vigorously while the enemy was held down by
[01:05:16] artillery fire what we call that you cover move those units which had learned to advance closely
[01:05:22] behind their own artillery supporting fire had the greatest success the japs do not like our
[01:05:28] coordinated artillery fire nor do they like our attacks with the bayonet when under fire from
[01:05:34] small arms they stay down in their holes and are easily approached when attacking small groups of
[01:05:41] foxholes our troops were able to keep the japs down by fire from rifles and the browning
[01:05:46] automatic rifle while some of our men approached and drop hang grenades into their holes this
[01:05:50] is our favorite mop up method cover move when about to be run out of a position the japs seem to
[01:05:57] feel it necessary to counter attack these attacks were not well coordinated and were welcomed by
[01:06:02] our troops who were able to shoot down the enemy in great numbers these jap counter attacks were part
[01:06:08] of a suicidal character and were pressed home regardless of losses until practically all the
[01:06:14] counter attack and troops were exterminated the enemy may believe that in such terrain he can
[01:06:22] hold up the advance of an entire battalion with three men and a light machine gun in fact however
[01:06:30] he is critically vulnerable to intelligent action by officers and men who understand the necessity
[01:06:36] for immediate maneuver against small parties of the enemy seeking to hold them up the fact was
[01:06:41] that a small maneuvering that small maneuvering patrols easily disposed of machine gun
[01:06:45] positions on reverse slopes behind mount spurs whereas any tendency to lie down and call for artillery
[01:06:50] support whatever resulted only in tremendous wastage of artillery fire and attempting to seek
[01:06:56] out targets which in fact were inaccessible artillery fire that's an important point so you think
[01:07:01] oh we got a machine gun up there we need a call for fire and now you think about how hard it's
[01:07:07] going to be for the start to lead a hit this place that's bunkered in or they're on the reverse
[01:07:11] slope of a mountain or whatever it's a real problem and yet these guys realize if they just
[01:07:17] aggressively maneuvered on that machine gun they'd be able to take it out the attue action
[01:07:23] likewise indicated that standard japini's infiltration tactics can be offset by a system of
[01:07:29] anti-termite patrols organized behind our lines protecting artillery command posts and supply
[01:07:33] lines wherever troops know that these friendly patrols were behind them fire in a rear will
[01:07:38] mean separate that our patrols are cleaning people up goes into the south Pacific
[01:07:46] talking about the jungle jungle notes aggressive action flexible plant plans
[01:07:50] report of the 43rd division new Georgia aggressive action is necessary never relax the pressure
[01:08:02] never relax the pressure that's a good that's a good just thing to think about every time you wake
[01:08:09] up in the morning never relax the pressure maneuver of small units at risk of temporary loss
[01:08:14] of communications is important plans and orders must be so flexible as to permit prompt maneuver
[01:08:22] change this is another thing where I would feel like I was cheating when I was you know going through
[01:08:27] training and stuff because we would make these really flexible plans and of course the training
[01:08:33] cadre is gonna do things to disrupt your plan and when your plan gets disrupted and it's super
[01:08:37] flexible like I would ever you know go plan be go with plan C no factor never relax the pressure
[01:08:44] it's actually pretty hard did disrupt a plan that's not very rigid you know yeah we didn't have like
[01:08:50] 37 steps that you can interrupt we had a basic idea and some real good ideas how we're gonna maneuver
[01:08:56] and disrupting that's much harder to that that that that that last one was awesome which one
[01:09:03] the the one we talked about never never ever relax pressure yeah like but I think the title that was
[01:09:10] aggressive action flexible plans whatever that title was just that alone obviously the description
[01:09:16] makes it even better but that in and of itself that will solve just that mindset yeah solves
[01:09:22] so many problems in a world anywhere in your world there's a couple things that you need to be aware of
[01:09:29] the way that you have flexible plans is you are religious about making sure everyone understands
[01:09:37] the commanders intent that's if you can do that hey this is what this is the overall thing that
[01:09:43] we're trying to accomplish here's the couple parameters you got to work within other than that make it
[01:09:48] happen yeah get aggressive making it happen because if you just make a flexible plan and you think
[01:09:55] hey you know you guys come in from the west and you guys come in from the south there's all kinds of
[01:09:59] things that go wrong with that plan it's super flexible but no one knows where they can't go where they can't
[01:10:03] go there's no deconfliction set up so you need to think about it the other thing that's interesting
[01:10:08] about aggressive action flexible plans is the more you plan the more detail you get the worse your
[01:10:14] plan becomes now if you come up with a plan in three minutes you probably need a little bit more
[01:10:20] time although I have executed operations where I we planned for 15 minutes my boss asked me that my
[01:10:28] boss said how much time do you guys need to launch this is my first deployment my second
[01:10:32] deployment no one asked me they already knew the answer my first point how much time you guys need
[01:10:36] I was like 15 minutes that's how much time what you're getting at though is the propensity of
[01:10:48] what how the things usually work out do we usually plan too much or not enough it's pretty rare
[01:10:54] that we don't plan enough what typically happens is we overplan an overplan an overplan and
[01:10:58] there's an old saying I don't know if it's just an aviation it's how long do you have to plan
[01:11:02] your mission and the joke is thirty how long do you need to plan your mission and the joke is the
[01:11:06] thirty minutes more than you have and the reason is is we have a propensity to overplan oh it
[01:11:12] says that maybe a nation yeah I thought I made that up you did not make it up unless it was on your
[01:11:17] trip to fall and all of a sudden you're the reason we said and we've been saying that for years and
[01:11:21] the point is kind of what you're getting at is oh if you gave me nine hours planned guess how long
[01:11:25] I'm going to plan nine hours can you underplan yes you absolutely can you can plan for two minutes
[01:11:32] when you actually need to spend some more time but the driver is is what you were saying is hey
[01:11:36] I only need 15 minutes I need to cover the key points the highlights and if you've got a team that's
[01:11:40] well trained they might even recognize you to listen we got a little additional risk here because
[01:11:44] we didn't really have time to dissect this once when we get to this place in the mission we need to be
[01:11:48] a little more aware that we're going to need to be a little more flexible and we have we're
[01:11:52] less aware than we like to be but I know that as opposed to hey let's take three days to plan
[01:11:57] by the time we get to the objective it's a total waste of time because because that mission has
[01:12:00] come and gone most teams that we work with overplan they overthink they over create and then
[01:12:07] when they go out to implement they're either too late or they're so rigid and what they do they can't
[01:12:12] maneuver around so if you're looking for the balance there less is typically more not always not 100
[01:12:19] percent of the time but that's where your bias should be it's kind of like packing right for
[01:12:23] trip kind of the same mindset which is like overpacking people overpack because they think of all
[01:12:30] the different scenarios they're going to need this jacket those socks this shoe and you flip
[01:12:35] flops too for the you see I'm saying mean while you got a washer dryer there you know you don't need
[01:12:39] all that stuff it'd be flexible same same yeah otherwise you got all these suitcases you know
[01:12:44] it's the same mindset is what I'm saying yeah yeah if you underpack but you're flexible
[01:12:52] it's way better yeah maneuver you can maneuver you know yeah it is weird that it's such an
[01:12:58] advantage to come up with a nice flexible plan that everybody knows and it's so easy man that
[01:13:04] the planning the planning what when I call it like the the evolution of planning inside the
[01:13:11] sealed teams you know at one point it was beyond insanity we wrote about it in an extreme
[01:13:18] ownership I mean it was a way Seth and Lave were taught to plan was was mayhem it was it was 150
[01:13:25] slide power points yeah that you know oh it your fonts wrong you follow you that you need to go
[01:13:32] through this branch plan and this other thing over here may when those guys started working with me
[01:13:37] I remember when I when I then it's talked about this in extreme ownership when I was telling
[01:13:42] those guys hey just make a plan that the lowest common denominator I get up have people walk through
[01:13:49] it look at the map use the map draw a picture draw it up on the whiteboard do that I remember Seth
[01:13:56] was looking at me like he was going to get fired like when he gives this brief he's going to get
[01:14:03] fired and it's funny because usually I would get that I would feel a little bit more push back from
[01:14:09] life on stuff and Seth would be like rea Roger and Lave would have why would we do like that
[01:14:14] and this time for whatever reason I think I think Lave actually just realized that this was the
[01:14:19] smartest thing he'd ever heard I think Lave just said to himself you know what this actually
[01:14:24] freaking makes sense and he was so on board with it he was so stoked and he had BTF Tony was his chief
[01:14:31] and that's the way you know Tony knew how to make shit happen and and I just but but Seth was just
[01:14:37] freaked out like well I mean you think he was so freaked out by the fact of thinking that
[01:14:43] he was getting fired for for trying to make his men understand what was going to happen on this
[01:14:51] mission and the cool thing was the commanding officer when when they got done because it was two
[01:14:56] platoon's going out on on an SR you know on a reconnaissance mission and they both took their
[01:15:00] platoon's out when they got done the you know the commanding officer who had gone around and
[01:15:06] watched all the platoon's give all their briefs and give all these 150 power points slides and
[01:15:11] do all these you know what what is it called animation in your slides he'd watched all those things
[01:15:17] and he he said these these are the best briefs of scene which was freaking awesome it was awesome
[01:15:22] because if the commanding officer can't follow what the hell is going to happen on an operation how
[01:15:29] is a new guy he four machine gunner can you not following anything and the more flexible you make these
[01:15:35] plans we're not all rigid what's kind of crazy about that is that commanding officer was
[01:15:40] probably stoked that the brief took nine minutes not forty nine minutes he was probably waiting
[01:15:45] like there we go yeah we're gonna come in and and he would probably look like that's it that's awesome
[01:15:49] yeah I mean it was you know it's still an hour long yeah but an hour long of real information
[01:15:56] as opposed to you know an hour and forty seven minutes of slides that are of you know
[01:16:03] asset matrix for the you know he knew represented thirty man hours of power point work
[01:16:10] to make the arrow move the point behind that was and I saw this in the Pentagon all the time
[01:16:16] I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some of this in the EA world working in you know with
[01:16:19] animals in general is we create this thing where we are we this is how the boss wants it
[01:16:26] and so we give the boss what he wants and some of the bosses are pretty they don't want to go
[01:16:30] down their mic manager people so they kind of tolerate it and we convince ourselves this is what
[01:16:34] the boss is looking for someone to do what make most of our bosses don't actually want this
[01:16:39] they just want to make sure they know that you know what you're going to go do to go get it done
[01:16:42] and the least amount of time it takes to make him comfortable that you know the plan is actually
[01:16:48] what he wants and I remember putting these briefs together and I'd get these templates to go
[01:16:52] brief these generals up in the top floor of the Pentagon it was a big thing you've got 19 minutes
[01:16:56] could submit this calendar and we go in there and for the first couple briefs we'd have
[01:17:02] 47 pages and he go hey can you just skip to the summary slide?
[01:17:05] Okay okay okay okay hey that may hey bolt through what do you mean by that?
[01:17:13] Hey sir we're talking about this okay cool awesome hey I hate to do it you guys I got to get
[01:17:16] going thanks but I'm good at your plan go execute they didn't want any of that garbage but we
[01:17:21] fall this template we are so sure that they want it most leaders really just want to know that you
[01:17:26] understand yeah and they want to understand the wave tops of what's happening so they understand
[01:17:32] I had this guy I was putting a I was putting a group through Landwater Fair and this guy gave
[01:17:38] a brief when it was horrible and long and freaking too detailed and covered stuff that didn't
[01:17:42] matter to anyone in the room and they gave another brief that was you know not enough and you know
[01:17:48] skipped like basic contingencies and then he was kind of frustrated and he goes what do you
[01:17:55] what do you even tell me what a good brief is as if that was like a trick question you know
[01:18:02] I was I thought about it for four seconds and I said a good brief is a brief where your mind
[01:18:10] understand what is going to happen and what to do during an operation that's a good brief
[01:18:17] and he was able to dial it in yeah this where in the jungle you might have forgotten that
[01:18:25] patrolling in the jungle an officer with considerable experience in the jungle patrolling gives
[01:18:31] this advice patrols are most likely to give away their presence in an area by their footprints
[01:18:36] shine from the smallest metal surface such as a belt buckle or watch must be avoided
[01:18:40] a luminous watch constitutes a real danger and he noise such as talking coughing, spitting,
[01:18:46] etc. must have to be treated with the greatest of all dangers a man on patrol must learn to move
[01:18:52] silently making every possible use of natural cover that's just old school stuff I got to
[01:18:58] feel something I was hunting it's like so happy to be moving quietly some more patrol tips
[01:19:06] positioning camouflage are more important than I learned in the states in training
[01:19:12] in training bear down on covering concealment bear down on avoidance of the blundering approach
[01:19:19] on patrols on fire maneuver which are equally important and I didn't read that well in training
[01:19:26] bear down on covering concealment bear down on the avoidance of blundering approach on patrols
[01:19:32] on fire maneuver which are equally important size of patrols the tenant kernel
[01:19:41] w a walker tank destroyer battalion commander Tunisia which you know let's just face it
[01:19:48] you're getting a title tank destroyer battalion commander is right up there many men were lost in Tunisia
[01:19:55] by using squad patrols the Germans used stronger patrols and just gobbled them up a patrol should be
[01:20:04] either a sneak patrol small enough to escape detection or a combat patrol large enough to fight
[01:20:10] its way out of difficulty never allow one man to go out alone you know what's interesting about that
[01:20:18] we don't want to be balanced right well it's not going to be balanced but what he's saying
[01:20:28] is like you either want to be small and maneuverable and quiet or big enough to fight
[01:20:34] don't don't don't try and make the mistake of trying to do both he will just take out a squad
[01:20:39] plus then you're making a bunch of noise the difference between you know six guys and 12 guys
[01:20:50] is a massive difference it is a massive difference on a patrol it's a totally like when we go out
[01:20:57] out of the squad patrol in the in the sealed teams you know you got eight guys it's this tiny little
[01:21:01] thing and you can see everyone and then at night with no night vision you can see everyone
[01:21:05] happens there you when you take out a patrol it seems like you've got this just massive thing
[01:21:12] and when you take out a task unit patrol it's just breaking gigantic like they're gonna hear you
[01:21:19] don't make that mistake so this is one of those things it's like it's not a dichotomy either or
[01:21:24] one of those rare things yeah because normally we're saying hey you don't go to the extreme one
[01:21:28] side of the other right want to be balanced yeah this is kind of like falling to the trap of
[01:21:34] well I want them to be small enough to be light nimble but big enough where you know they can
[01:21:37] defend themselves and what you're gonna end up with is not small and light and not able to defend
[01:21:41] themselves right like not not big enough to fight yet not small enough to move yes it's kind of like
[01:21:48] a we you serve obviously it's kind of like when you judge waves right you're either too far
[01:21:54] for it to crash on you or you just go 100% under the wave you know I'm saying otherwise it crashes on
[01:22:00] you either go over it or under it or it crashes way before it can hit you oh that's that's
[01:22:07] a positive thing yes you don't want it to crash on you on yes you are gonna be in that want that
[01:22:12] little middle ground you don't want to be in the in the zone of destruction yeah there it's own
[01:22:16] there's a movie called the North Shore the impacts on impacts on yeah so North Shore he covered that
[01:22:22] yeah it was like yeah you're like you don't want to be actually this guy turtle they mean you're
[01:22:26] watching North Shore deeper no yeah Rick King anyway got from Arizona wins a tank surfing competition
[01:22:32] so he's like of course I'm going to the North Shore so he's kind of a tank destroyer
[01:22:40] in a matter of speaking yes unless tank waves are pretty small and tame you know the artificial
[01:22:46] waves in Arizona apparently so he goes to the North Shore and you know he kind of gets wrecked for
[01:22:50] a little bit anyway meets the sky turtle and turtle says if the wave is here don't be here because
[01:22:56] you're gonna get drilled classic climate so same deal in this maybe we should cover that movie on
[01:23:03] here just to get these make sure we pass on these lessons learned I'm just saying these concepts are
[01:23:07] everywhere that's that's the thing
[01:23:11] the next section is called infantry weapons goes through detail M1 rifle frag grenades
[01:23:16] the Thompson Sub machine gun the Browning our automatic rifle the light machine gun heavy
[01:23:21] machine gun 60 millimeter motor 81 millimeter mortar the 37 millimeter AT gun the 4.2 inch chemical
[01:23:30] mortar which was originally called that because it was originally made for firing chemical shells
[01:23:36] but eventually they adjusted it put HE in there but they still called it the uh so it goes through
[01:23:41] like really good kind of pragmatic details of on how to operate those weapons talks about
[01:23:47] next sections about artillery we what's chemical mortar chemical mortar is what to fire well what
[01:23:54] they disguised it was was this is a smoke mortar so we're gonna shoot if we have to use smoke
[01:24:01] to you know cover movement or we want to disrupt the enemies ability to see we have a
[01:24:07] mortar for firing smoke but that was really so we could fire chemical weapons if we were going to
[01:24:14] use them like well like to hear nerve gas yeah like yeah like you're gonna die but we didn't do
[01:24:21] that we ended up making an HE round high exposed just kind of a normal mortar round for it and they liked it
[01:24:30] section called mast fires through tenet kernel james infantry Sicily our division artillery
[01:24:35] was never out of support from more than five minutes throughout the whole campaign we've got a
[01:24:40] wonderful set of battalions in our division artillery and we have worked so closely together that
[01:24:44] there is much part of our outfit as our own battalions they kept they keep right up on our heels
[01:24:50] all the time and that is just what we've got to have I don't know what we could have done without them
[01:24:56] they leap frog their batteries continually and went into some of the damnedest positions I had
[01:25:01] ever seen and delivered the goods we just can't praise them too much they were always right there
[01:25:08] when you needed them in one place where we couldn't get forward because the hi-nees were on
[01:25:12] superior ground and had us pinned down with rifle machine gun and mortar fire the division artillery
[01:25:17] mast nine batteries on them and plastered them with fifteen hundred rounds in less than 30 minutes
[01:25:24] we then walk through that position without a scratch and the German dead were all over the place
[01:25:35] teamwork infantry tank team captain putton in infantry Sicily the infantry should be given
[01:25:44] practical training in cooperation with tanks I don't mean the armored infantry they're part of the
[01:25:48] armored division work with them all the time I mean ordinary infantry like us I know our regiment
[01:25:53] didn't have any training with tanks in preparation for combat we just didn't know how to work with
[01:25:57] the attached tank unit when the dirt when the tanks came up to supporters after we had broken up
[01:26:02] the German attack we did not follow up the tanks properly as they went forward had we done so we
[01:26:07] could have cleaned out most of the battalion of Germans we had not been trained to work with the
[01:26:12] tanks and when we remained in position they went and we were mainly in position after they went
[01:26:16] forward if we would have known how to go forward with them we could have done a much better job
[01:26:21] and could have gotten all the German vehicles and material after this experience we strongly
[01:26:27] recommend that all infantry be given practical training cooperation with tanks and action
[01:26:32] get the infantry men used to the tanks and how to fight together with them for me that's a
[01:26:38] a comment about training in general you know you can't expect people to do things that they've never
[01:26:43] trained to do so don't expect them to do things that they haven't been going to do if there's
[01:26:46] something that they need to know how to do it that they might have to do train them on it
[01:26:54] Colonel Perkins tank battalion commander Italy the rush to battle is the wrong idea
[01:27:02] here we creep up each tank should Overwatch another tank each section should Overwatch another
[01:27:08] section each platoon should Overwatch another platoon Ranger training buddy system Lieutenant Colonel William O.
[01:27:24] Darby commanding officer of the rangers in Italy and I think everybody kind of knows what I say
[01:27:33] we said Lieutenant Colonel William O. Darby I know they at least think of the Darby Queen
[01:27:39] the the ranger off-school course in our work we always use the buddy system the men work in pairs
[01:27:46] they live in pairs even pairs do garden pairs even do kp in pairs confidence and jugglers developed
[01:27:51] they can pick their own buddy from within their platoon same thing in the seal teams day one
[01:27:58] you get a swim buddy and stick with them realism in our training we never do anything without battle
[01:28:03] noises and effects we always use live ammunition we use mines barbed wire and protective bands of
[01:28:09] machine gun fire extensively if the problem is to capture a machine gun nest there's always a machine
[01:28:13] gun nest there with a machine gun firing in a fixed direction the men very quickly get a custom
[01:28:18] to having live ammunition flying around them capture the telling the German machine guns and
[01:28:23] machine pistols are used by the enemy in our problems that he's talking about the out for
[01:28:27] our men quickly learn to distinguish between the fire of our own weapons and that of enemy weapons
[01:28:32] also the enemy makes constant use of flares we always carry our normal load of ammunition with weapons
[01:28:38] loaded if a man knows his weapon is loaded he will be more careful in handling it an accidental discharge
[01:28:43] of a weapon automatically means a fine and immediate reduction to the grade of private
[01:28:50] in our work we must take drastic measures to guard against accidental discharge of weapons
[01:28:55] we learned our lesson in Tunisia where the accidental discharge of a rifle
[01:29:02] cleared a raid and caused a 24 hour delay in operations so all kinds of good stuff in there and
[01:29:09] and I will say this so when I got the seal teams it was almost all live fire we did live fire
[01:29:14] for everything and it gave you that kind of pressure and that kind of you you got a custom to
[01:29:19] machine guns and hearing them and you know round snapping overhead and you do you got used to it
[01:29:25] in fact there were days where they would put us down range and just shoot you know put put
[01:29:30] put you down range you'd go behind a berm or whatever you get in a safe spot and then they just
[01:29:34] shoot at you so you'd start getting used to like okay this is what different round sound like and
[01:29:39] you you know that happens even being in the butts at a you know on a normal range
[01:29:43] but that kind of realism is important here's the drawback the drawback is the enemy doesn't
[01:29:49] maneuver the enemy doesn't shoot back at you so when we started using
[01:29:55] simulation paintball laser tag systems that totally improved our tactical capability
[01:30:03] to an incredible amount the accidental discharge that's still a huge deal right oh yeah
[01:30:09] what is it now like them I mean they're they're talking about finding people and busing them
[01:30:12] down the private I mean it I think some of it depends on the circumstances you know if you have
[01:30:18] an actual discharge in the seal teams it's going to be your careers your careers are the line
[01:30:23] you know if you if you have something like that happen it's not necessarily going to be over
[01:30:29] but you're going to have a real you're going to have to keep your hopes up they don't
[01:30:35] that you don't get so even like like a called AD right or AD
[01:30:41] AD and the which is a negligent discharge I think they are now I'm not like totally caught up on
[01:30:49] the terminology of where it's at right now the and the just started coming around when I was
[01:30:58] sort of in my later years yeah I feel like negligent that's like careless in
[01:31:04] yeah so like an accidental discharge which to your point you can have a you can have a you
[01:31:09] can have around just cook off like you're out in the desert in Imperial Valley in California it's
[01:31:14] 120 degrees out and you dump six mags on your last run and you're standing there your weapon
[01:31:20] is scorching hot and if there's around in the chamber it can cook off it can just shoot that's
[01:31:25] why you have your weapon painted pointed in this air direction at all times if that happened you
[01:31:31] you're not going to get I mean you know you're not really going to get trouble I mean is if everyone
[01:31:36] didn't have the weapon clearance if but when it's hot out everyone be like hey clearance if
[01:31:39] your weapons but you know we also used to have a command safe and let them hang which is just you
[01:31:43] just safe your weapon you just let it hang there so we've got a hot round and there it can cook off
[01:31:47] you're probably not you know you're not going to get in trouble for that most likely you occasionally
[01:31:53] a weapon will have some kind of a malfunction that will cause a problem what else can happen
[01:32:00] I feel like something like that like I've weapons malfunction the hot you know that's like
[01:32:05] an accident that's an accident that negligent is the kind like that's not I had my finger in the
[01:32:09] trigger yeah and you know somebody called a ceasefire and all of a sudden you know I kind of let
[01:32:16] my weapon hang when it's resting on my finger and I crack off around and they get a lot of trouble
[01:32:20] for that yeah interesting this is more on range of training physical conditioning one of our best
[01:32:29] means a physical conditioning is speed marching finally reaching a point where we march 10 miles
[01:32:35] at a rate of 6 miles an hour to keep in condition we use calcthenics in a daily 5 miles speed march
[01:32:43] discipline discipline aerodryals are all important we have a retreat formation daily
[01:32:51] conditions permitting at this formation the men are inspected and some manual of arms performed
[01:32:56] followed by retreat every Sunday morning there is a review followed by inspection in the ranks
[01:33:00] and then inspection of the camp or quarters we have at least four periods a week of closed order
[01:33:05] drill and manual of arms and one period every week devoted to military courtesy
[01:33:12] infractions of discipline military courtesy and uniform regulations are dealt with quickly
[01:33:18] and severely the officers must bear down on these things the army in general has not stressed
[01:33:23] strict discipline enough without it you are lost yeah one of those things
[01:33:37] can you go too far with discipline Dave Burke yes you can absolutely
[01:33:43] I mean obviously don't know the background of that story but you know the version of the story he's
[01:33:48] talking about is the guys that could feel stripper weapon in the dark at night
[01:33:52] on the worst possible situations we had nine seconds to get that weapon back in action you need
[01:33:56] discipline and repeat and wrote and over you need that and then the flip side is exactly
[01:34:02] we started this whole conversation with if I just if I if you do it because you're scared of me
[01:34:07] and I tell you to do it because if you don't you're going to get punished sooner or later sooner or later
[01:34:13] that approach will fail and look I know with the context of the book is so it's driven by that
[01:34:18] first scenario but you absolutely can overdo it yeah and then you could be like John Basilone
[01:34:26] Basil and you'd hear stories from guys that work with him and they absolutely loved
[01:34:38] doing the right thing drilling with those weapons he set the example he did it in front of
[01:34:45] them at night blindfold all those things he did all those things he did and he like they love
[01:34:50] doing it he was inspirational he didn't impose discipline on them he showed them and gave them
[01:34:58] the gift of self discipline which is far superior dude and thinking the mileage you get is if
[01:35:04] I've ever as a leader the discipline that you demand from your people and the punishment that might
[01:35:10] come from not doing it if you actually impose it upon yourself as well and hold yourself to the
[01:35:14] same standard as opposed to get out there and go do that and I'm gonna sit in here and I don't know
[01:35:19] watch TV or something that piece of it when you're talking about that discipline what you get
[01:35:25] when you hold yourself to the exact same standard as your people Basil section two field artillery
[01:35:34] morale effect the incestant firing of our artillery during the six week period
[01:35:40] produced contrasting effects on the nerves of our own troops and on those the enemy
[01:35:46] our infantry often stated that having those rounds continually landing in front of them was
[01:35:50] one of the best morale builders especially at night in the jab on the other hand it produced
[01:35:56] severe cases of war neurosis he couldn't sleep at night because he never knew when or where
[01:36:04] the next round was going to land he couldn't sleep in the daytime because when our infantry
[01:36:10] wasn't attacking him our artillery was giving him hell and this is nice the following statements
[01:36:17] made by prisoners are interesting so these are Japanese prisoners of which we know there wasn't
[01:36:22] a lot between the airport between be below hill and the airport we had many guns of all sizes
[01:36:31] before this campaign but now many of them are gone knocked out by artillery it is completely
[01:36:39] demoralized many units reduced many units in strength and has made many men go crazy
[01:36:48] we were awakened at night by the slightest noise because of the bad state of nerves
[01:36:53] at night three men stayed in one foxhole two smoked while one slept
[01:36:58] during the day we also tried to get some sleep by alternating but the continual artillery fire
[01:37:04] kept us on edge and we got no rest even in the two story dugouts many men were killed just by
[01:37:12] concussion a direct hit would kill all the men inside the artillery is the one thing that is
[01:37:18] universally feared by all our ground troops it continues over such long periods of time and the
[01:37:25] rounds come so fast except for the artillery we could continue our defense that's horror
[01:37:36] that's just horror
[01:37:43] section three miscellaneous booby traps seventh army report Sicily a German
[01:37:49] Luger pistol was booby trapped on a table new replacement picked it up two were killed and
[01:37:54] 14 were wounded in the resulting explosion there's another little set I wasn't going to read this
[01:38:01] but I'm going to read it a Luger pistol was found lying on the ground an American infantry
[01:38:04] lieutenant carefully tied a long court to it and then getting into a hole pulled it to him and
[01:38:09] put it in his pocket later in the day while examining the pistol he attempted to remove the magazine
[01:38:14] the explosion killed the lieutenant and two other men with six soldiers wounded
[01:38:18] the reason I'm reading that is because that was a freaking they set that thing up that's a that's a
[01:38:25] massive explosion from a small piece of from a small pistol timelyness of orders major
[01:38:33] kidney infantry are chief difficulty throughout the campaign was the lack of time given for the
[01:38:38] execution of orders frequently received operations orders which did not allow enough time for
[01:38:43] proper preparation and execution at San Fratello we received an order after 11 p.m. to attack
[01:38:50] at six a.m. the next morning now when I read that I was like hey man that's kind of thinking
[01:38:57] you all said I'll come up with a simple flexible plan no factor I got this what are they whining about
[01:39:02] read on the six battagans were assembly were in assembly areas some five or six miles
[01:39:08] from the line of departure so even to get to where they were supposed to leave from the had to
[01:39:14] go six miles the terrain over which they had to move to get in position in the dark was the
[01:39:18] roughest most rugged mountain country you can imagine and all ammunition weapons it supplies
[01:39:23] had to be taken by hand and by muelpack although it might seem that 11 p.m. to six a.m. was
[01:39:29] sufficient time the actual conditions were such that it was less than half done enough because the
[01:39:34] terrain darkness and transport difficulties also the men had just completed marches over mountain
[01:39:38] trails of nine to 14 miles and we're not fresh for the new movement maps seven th Army
[01:39:51] report Sicily instill an all personnel and appreciation of the value of maps the supply of maps
[01:39:56] will never be adequate to the demand training in the care and preservation of maps is as important
[01:40:03] as training in the care and preservation of material most important thing you need to know
[01:40:11] most important piece of information is where you are and if your map is destroyed have you
[01:40:16] received those old school silk maps yes things are legit they print them on silk echo trails
[01:40:22] because then they could survive I like this section this section is called room for improvement
[01:40:32] the following comments indicating weaknesses which must be corrected were made by the commanding
[01:40:38] general and they don't give the division I guess they're keeping it secret here we go sometimes
[01:40:44] units failed to dispose themselves properly for all round defense when halted on an objective or
[01:40:50] in place in position for defense so when you go into defense they're not putting themselves in the
[01:40:57] right positions next in the attack rifleman frequently failed to provide fire that would cover
[01:41:04] the movement of adjacent units merely because they were not able to pinpoint definitely the location
[01:41:10] of the enemy rifle and machine gun elements firing on our troops what does that mean that means
[01:41:16] you fire where you suspect the enemy will be and that's something that infantry men and special
[01:41:23] operations people learn is if you don't know where the enemy has a new gunfight shoot where you think they
[01:41:28] might be this is perhaps one of my favorite things from this book some small unit commanders
[01:41:40] selected positions apparently with cover and concealment for themselves as the primary objective
[01:41:47] rather than positions from which effective fire could be brought to bear on the enemy
[01:41:56] and the last one due to the enormous division frontage in the second phase of the landing at
[01:42:01] Soleno some company some commanders attempted to stretch their units excessively and as a result
[01:42:08] permitted faulty dispositions prioritize next here they go into some details on the Japanese
[01:42:21] overall and you know I've been reading the book and saying japs I know that's a derogatory term
[01:42:30] towards Japanese people I'm not referring to Japanese people I'm referring to the
[01:42:34] Imperial Japanese army members that were fighting against America and we're being referred to
[01:42:40] by their sworn enemy the Americans has japs Superman myth exploded that's the title of this
[01:42:49] operations report 43rd division new Georgia our troops here came to regard the superman stories
[01:42:56] about the Japanese as ridiculous the jap is tricky but not so tricky as many of lead
[01:43:04] been led to believe he is not he is not nearly so ingenious or adaptable as the average American
[01:43:10] and the truth of the matter is he's afraid of us of our artillery and of our sea and airpower
[01:43:18] our troops must learn this and never forget it yeah
[01:43:25] this is the last the last no and this it keeps some stuff about the Japanese as an enemy
[01:43:37] and then it gives some stuff about the Germans as an enemy and this is the last one here
[01:43:42] the last one from this book for part one of combat lessons minor tactics staff sergeants
[01:43:50] Richard E. Deeland and Robert J. Camp infantry Sicily never let an apparently low machine gun
[01:44:01] suck you into a trap the Germans will usually not fire on the individual but will wait
[01:44:08] watch where he goes and get a whole flock and that's the last point in here and I think it's
[01:44:19] it's not the last point in this whole book there's a few more but I think it's a good place to stop
[01:44:24] and the reason why I think it's a good place to stop is because it's a warning it's a warning
[01:44:32] about a trap it's a warning about a trap that the Germans use which is you know put it
[01:44:37] what loan looking machine gun out there by itself oh that looks exposed and it seems real
[01:44:44] obvious when you read it you're like hey if I see a but look too good to be true right this is
[01:44:48] too good to be true this is the situation and so it's real obvious to anyone that's looking
[01:44:53] at it going oh that's too good to be true there's a right machine gun that's waiting to be taken out
[01:45:00] looks real obvious an obvious trap and yet the warning is there why is the warning still there
[01:45:09] because people still fall for it you will still fall for it I will still fall for it we will all
[01:45:16] still fall for that trap just like we will fall for the trap that we're good to go
[01:45:27] that we know everything that we need to know that we understand everything that we need to understand
[01:45:32] that we have reached our highest possible form
[01:45:37] then all those little thoughts are a trap because we're not good then we don't know everything
[01:45:52] we don't understand everything and we have absolutely not reached our highest form we all have
[01:45:58] work to do so watch out for that trap because it is enticing it is enticing like a low machine gun
[01:46:08] just gonna sit out there by itself waiting to be taken out and it's real easy to tell yourself
[01:46:18] that you're good so here's a little warning for all of us especially me
[01:46:24] we can't fall for that trap
[01:46:38] well that wraps up that
[01:46:42] then the other notes Dave
[01:46:45] no we addressed all of it that I wrote down and the whole lot more
[01:46:49] you know there these lessons all those statements that comments the explanations
[01:47:00] they all come from the same place as that trap they're all lessons learned the hard way
[01:47:06] and as repetitive as they sort of sound they're all because all those are the same thing
[01:47:10] I'm gonna say this over and over and over again because this keeps happening over and over and over again
[01:47:15] it's in some ways it's it's heartbreaking but that is the reality is that even those lessons of
[01:47:21] the things we're supposed to do come from
[01:47:25] we had a saying an aviation they come they were written in blood they all came from a lesson
[01:47:30] that's already been we already know that but we learned it the hard way and
[01:47:37] you you you repeat yourself all the time and I don't mean that about you repeat yourself
[01:47:43] we do it as shown for it we repeat ourselves all the time we take the same thing and then
[01:47:47] try to apply the context to whatever world whatever company whatever business whatever problem we're
[01:47:52] dealing with but we're always saying the same thing because these lessons these lessons get learned
[01:47:57] over and over and over again and the biggest
[01:48:01] biggest thing that prevents us from making that lesson stick is what you just said is ourselves going oh
[01:48:08] no I got it I've heard it enough I understand it and the minute you are convinced that you've
[01:48:13] heard it enough and you've got it is when you're gonna learn the exact same lesson again
[01:48:20] yeah it's weird how I mean this happens to us all the time in national and front
[01:48:28] you you go we go into a company the companies in the game they're in the game they're
[01:48:34] they're telling me I mean there's definitely people it happens on the f-on line somebody
[01:48:38] who brings something up and somebody like oh jockel podcast number 128 he talks about that
[01:48:43] I don't know off top man but someone's answering that question in a millisecond right
[01:48:48] people that know the material so we go into companies where they know they've read they know
[01:48:55] they wrote memorized I guess no is a strong word right
[01:48:59] but and I talked about this on the Darryl Cooper and I got to got into it a little bit
[01:49:08] on the unraveling podcast because he was saying to me well how do you handle something when you know
[01:49:16] that the other person's premise is wrong and you know he was pretty dug in and I said well
[01:49:25] do you actually really know that because I'm not gonna approach anything if Dave Burke comes to me
[01:49:33] and says hey jocco a UFO just touched down in my backyard I need support here ASAP
[01:49:45] right not the split hairs but you mean extra terrestrial what did I say UFO okay yeah
[01:49:51] UFO's just unidentified okay so he identified so he calls me up and says unidentified
[01:49:56] extraterrestrial machine just landed in my backyard
[01:50:04] do what do I say look I know that's not true or do I right you know what I say I say well what does it look like
[01:50:11] what what sort of what sort of weaponry do you see do are they is they're covering element
[01:50:17] can you extract from the aO until we can assemble a counter force to go after these guys right
[01:50:24] I don't just say hey Dave shut up you know I hate bringing out I'm like that's a dumb example
[01:50:29] right but it's really hard for me to think of something that I should say it's really hard it's not man
[01:50:36] people think that they know stuff all the time and what I say on the F online the other day I said
[01:50:40] you don't mistake your opinion for the truth don't mistake your opinion for the truth don't
[01:50:48] mistake people don't mistake what you've heard and what you've said for the truth don't
[01:50:55] mistake the way you've always done things for the truth don't mistake your perspective for the truth
[01:51:02] and that is why when you speak the truth and you and I talked about this the other day Dave
[01:51:06] when you speak the truth what you should do is speak the truth humbly replace
[01:51:10] of humility. Speak the truth from a place of humility. That's how you speak the truth.
[01:51:17] Because even when you believe something and you quote, no, it's right, there is a chance and you
[01:51:24] need to open your mind to this chance that you are actually wrong and you didn't understand something.
[01:51:29] You didn't understand a different perspective. And all those things, all those things of, you know,
[01:51:37] thinking that you know, thinking that you don't make this mistake, all those things, thinking
[01:51:43] that your opinion is the truth, all those things, those are all traps, those are all just traps.
[01:51:48] And they seem so obvious when we're sitting here talking about them. And yet, day after day after
[01:51:51] day, you see people fall into those traps. And so what's interesting is when we talk about these lessons
[01:51:57] and where I was starting this little idea is that you and I work with companies all the time,
[01:52:03] and they know the material. They can recite the material. And yet, they're caught up, they're not
[01:52:13] detached and they're not executing correctly. And so one of the primary things and it's
[01:52:18] great being an echelon front because when we come in, we are instantly, where do we are detached?
[01:52:24] That's our function. So as soon as we just take them and we move them over to our position,
[01:52:31] three feet and say, look at that meeting, look at how that meeting just went. Or, you know,
[01:52:36] look at this, look at this, this, this, this task the way you put this out to the troops. Look at this.
[01:52:41] Just look at it. Does that sound like your micro managing? Does that sound like you're not
[01:52:50] giving any ownership like, what does it sound like? If you read this and all of a sudden, people go,
[01:52:53] well, so you've got to watch out for these traps in the world.
[01:53:01] I'm going to say something that's a total contradiction. Because all these quotes, all these
[01:53:10] lessons, all the things you were just reading about in that in this book or whatever this is,
[01:53:14] this compilation of people's lessons that they've learned. I was thinking about how often these
[01:53:23] things get repeated. And it's this idea of, hey, the minute you think you know these lessons,
[01:53:29] the minute you think you, I know this is when you actually have the most amount of risk. And at the
[01:53:35] same time of thinking myself, I wish I knew all this stuff at the very beginning of my career.
[01:53:42] And to think about what I actually could have done with my time in the Marine Corps, if I knew this stuff,
[01:53:47] and like to see the ultimate dichotomy of you never know this stuff, you have to learn it
[01:53:55] over and over again. And if I just knew this stuff, how much better I would have been at what I was
[01:53:59] doing. The broad understanding of it is what people, is what makes it hard for people to
[01:54:11] understand a level where it can be utilized. Because I know for a fact that you were taught,
[01:54:18] you know, hey, okay, when you're going through the basics, I was like, okay, you got this element over
[01:54:21] here, they're going to put down a cut. You were absolutely taught that. I was absolutely taught that.
[01:54:27] And yet I ended up having to teach this stuff to seals. Guys that have been in for 15 years,
[01:54:33] 20 years, be like, hey, why don't you put in some machine guns out on the flanks,
[01:54:38] why you cross this road? Oh, that's a good old school thing. No, it's actually covered move.
[01:54:42] This is a good basic thing that we do all the time. You know, and I'm not saying it every
[01:54:47] seal, but I'm just saying seals that I've been in the Navy for a long time. And that's
[01:54:57] what's so difficult about these things. And I was thinking about this the other day.
[01:55:01] You start, okay, when you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do academy?
[01:55:08] And you, the more people that are at the academy and the better they get, it's like a pyramid.
[01:55:14] If you're at the top of the pyramid, so Dean Lister is at the top of the pyramid at Victory MMA.
[01:55:21] Every single time someone shows up new, they're a white belt.
[01:55:25] Well, they show up here and they take their first class. That pyramid gets a little bit taller.
[01:55:31] And Dean Lister gets a little bit better from one person showing up here. Because I one person's
[01:55:35] going to train in a different way and he's going to prop up somebody else and that little
[01:55:39] movement raises everyone up by a time he gets to me. I'm going up a little bit and then Dean's
[01:55:43] going up just getting a little bit better. So what happens, I think is these ideas.
[01:55:48] When you first hear them, they're just sort of there and you don't connect them.
[01:55:55] And then as you start to connect them together, all of a sudden, well, not all of a sudden,
[01:56:01] as you start to connect them together, they start getting taller and taller and taller and taller.
[01:56:06] And you start to see more connections. And really for me, this is, it does boil down to
[01:56:12] what made me start to connect these things was jujitsu. In the fact that I could see
[01:56:17] in jujitsu what I saw people supposed to do in the battlefield, those were the first two
[01:56:23] connections that I made. And it's probably because I heard it somewhere. I'm sure somebody said,
[01:56:28] you know martial arts are like combat. And what does that mean? Or whatever. But then I started seeing
[01:56:33] the actual connection between the two. And then at some point, I started seeing that,
[01:56:40] oh, those same things actually work in leadership inside of a team period. And now I'll
[01:56:45] listen to everything looks connected. And now I'll listen when you start, when you, when you learn
[01:56:50] to move in jujitsu, when you learn to move in a jujitsu and you don't know anything, that move is a
[01:56:57] is a solitary thing by itself. It's unsupported in any way. You really can't even barely even
[01:57:04] utilize that move because it's just by itself. You don't even know what position to get into.
[01:57:09] You don't know how to get into that position. You don't know how to set it up. You don't know
[01:57:12] anything. You know that move, but it's so easy to forget because it's not connected to anything else.
[01:57:17] The better you get, the more knowledge you have, all of the sudden you start putting these things
[01:57:22] together and now they become a system. Now they're all interrelated. And now when you see something,
[01:57:28] here's something, it fits into, you see how it fits into this overall broad view of things,
[01:57:33] which is why, you know, we constantly are quoting, if you see the way, if you see the way,
[01:57:39] Broadway, you'll see it in all things. And that's what this is, but it takes a certain level
[01:57:44] of understanding before you can see the way, broadly. And, you know, I talk to young
[01:57:51] guys that are going in the seal teams and they just have no, this stuff isn't even on the
[01:57:59] f- it's not even on the radar in any way shape or form. Right? And part of it is because they
[01:58:05] don't see the seal teams, they see the seal teams. I was like, oh, I'm going to go make it through
[01:58:09] buds and I'm going to go and, you know, I'm going to go run and we're going to shoot machine guns.
[01:58:14] They don't understand what this profession is. And it's better now than it was. I mean, the
[01:58:20] guys, when I came in, I didn't freaking understand any of this, definitely any way shape or form.
[01:58:24] I better even understood what it meant to, okay, you're going to be part of this squad and this squad
[01:58:31] has responsibilities to an overall, I barely grasp any of that. But as you start to assemble this
[01:58:39] information, and so that's what's hard. So going back to working with the client, like until
[01:58:45] you can start bringing things together for them. Until they start connecting these things in their
[01:58:51] own head, that's another thing is I can sit there and with a ball-peen hammer hit you with one spot
[01:58:59] and go cover and move, cover and move. Until you see that cover and move is connected to these other
[01:59:06] things, it's very, very difficult to force the knowledge onto that onto another human.
[01:59:13] Yeah. And I made the comment earlier about, I wish I knew these things. There's a whole bunch of
[01:59:19] reasons why you simply can't at the beginning, just like you described. I guess the second lieutenant
[01:59:24] Dave Burke almost can't know this, no matter how crystal clear these lessons are from World War II
[01:59:31] and forever back. And the other side of that though is that even even when you can, it's still never
[01:59:42] ends finding more to know. Dude, I taught it top gun. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:59:49] the, the, the, the apex of aviation and the pinnacle and all these things that we used to describe top gun,
[01:59:54] this PhD level graduate level system of combat aviation top gun, you know what I was teaching there?
[02:00:02] Cover and move cover and move and you know why I was teaching cover and move because the mistakes
[02:00:08] that top gun made the students made to go through top gun were mistakes they weren't doing cover
[02:00:13] move even at that level. The reason I was talking about simple plans at top gun, we didn't use
[02:00:20] the same words, but I was teaching that same thing is because the plans weren't simple and nobody
[02:00:24] really understood them and they go out and missions come back and hey, what, what did I scare
[02:00:27] them? Well, this guy's in listen to me. Well, that could be it, but actually it's probably not,
[02:00:32] what probably is it you did explain to very well. The reason I was teaching these same simple
[02:00:37] fundamental things at top gun is that those are the mistakes that were being made repeatedly
[02:00:41] by some of the best most experienced pilots in the world. And as I hear myself say, I wish I knew
[02:00:49] this stuff and I'm not laughing at the phrase, know this stuff. It's crazy how even now that I know
[02:00:58] it's so much more than ever new, what I really know is how little I still really know and how much
[02:01:05] more that is out there and that's why every time you break out another book I'm like, do that book
[02:01:08] was awesome even though saying he exact same things they're all saying. But that's actually
[02:01:19] that's actually really good because we get to do this again. Yeah, we get to do it over and over again
[02:01:28] and get to see it from a different angle and get to understand it a little bit deeper. Like when this
[02:01:33] example comes in the pyramid goes up just a little bit more and it ties together another
[02:01:39] little part of your brain and I often wonder, you know, there's some lessons that you cannot
[02:01:50] teach to someone like they have to, they have to experience it, right? And there's unfortunately
[02:01:57] a lot of lessons like that. Let's face it. Let's face it. That is the vast majority of lessons
[02:02:02] because everyone, otherwise everyone would get issued a certain book in age 12 and here's what you
[02:02:06] need to know and they'd be like, oh cool, got it. Okay, save my money. Okay, eat healthy. Okay,
[02:02:11] you know, because all these fundamental things that a human being could do that if you did all these
[02:02:15] fundamental things and by the way, these are not hidden knowledge. These are common knowledge.
[02:02:22] These are these are just common knowledge things that everyone kind of knows and yet we think it's
[02:02:29] going to be different for us. We think we get, I don't need, I'm going to do it a little bit differently
[02:02:34] and it's no, it's not going to work. No, it's not going to work. So taking these things and that's
[02:02:41] what that's another good thing is you have to experience some, in some way you have to experience
[02:02:46] and that's one good thing that happens at echelon front is you are in an environment where you
[02:02:53] get to use this stuff real world and that's been interesting, you know, sort of after the first
[02:02:58] six weeks of the COVID lockdown, not even six weeks, the feedback we started getting was
[02:03:05] from many of the companies we work with was this stuff really works and the reason that they were
[02:03:11] saying is because they'd never really been tested in it before. Yeah, you know, they're doing
[02:03:15] great, they want to do even better and now they go and do better and they go, wow, the stuff really
[02:03:19] works, doesn't it? So hard to learn and the thing that makes it hardest to learn is if you fall into
[02:03:29] the trap of I know it. I wish it was another, I'm familiar with it, right? There's got to be a lesser
[02:03:36] form of I know because I know as a, there's a, that's a hundred percent. I know as a hundred percent.
[02:03:41] There should be a lesser form of no, maybe I'm familiar with. I, I, I understand that
[02:03:49] a decent level, some of the concepts that we talk about. This is not new to me. Yeah, this is not
[02:03:56] new to me. That sounds a little bit. Is that a little bit kind of? Yeah, no, is it a little bit
[02:04:01] arrogant? Yeah. Oh, okay. That's why that's kind of part of the gig. No, I'm looking for a word that
[02:04:08] actually says, I'm very familiar with this, but I know that I have a lot to learn. We should
[02:04:14] know that. Yes, I'm not sure. Okay. Yeah. The word for how I feel. The word for how we should all
[02:04:20] feel. Yeah. Okay. I thought, which is I am striving to be better. I'm familiar. I know that
[02:04:27] these things exist and I know that I don't, you know, like them, like basically seeing your
[02:04:33] white belt at this. Yeah. And maybe it's like saying I'm a purple belt at this. Yeah. Which is
[02:04:38] that I'm just on the path. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hoiler back in the day, long time ago, I did a website
[02:04:44] form and he was at my house and it was me and kid polygroom. And it's and hoiler. What's up, kid? What's
[02:04:50] up, hoiler? Yeah. And so we're me and kid, balie girl, we're lucky. And he said, hey, so we're looking
[02:05:00] at it and he's like, hey, we're trying to integrate his enemy. We're doing some technical stuff,
[02:05:04] so I'm doing this. I was like, okay, this is what you got to do. You got to do this, I think. And
[02:05:08] he's like, maybe if we did this, so we tried it his way, boom, and it worked. So it like, you know,
[02:05:12] it's rendered on the screen. And hoiler's like, it's his website, but he doesn't know this part. He's like,
[02:05:16] oh, I'm a white belt at this stuff. And it gave me that feeling that that you just mentioned.
[02:05:22] I know, like it reminded me of that time. Kind of like he knows what's going on, but he has no
[02:05:27] idea how deep it goes, you know, in the back end like that. Yeah. Well, there's that, there's definitely
[02:05:32] that time period when you start your jitsu. And you, the first couple days, it takes a little while to go,
[02:05:39] wow, I really don't know a lot, because in the beginning, you think it's finite. Yeah. That's the
[02:05:44] big difference. Yeah. In the beginning, you think it's 13 moves. And then you go, oh, wait, it's actually
[02:05:51] probably 35 moves. When I started a jitsu, I thought it was nine moves. That's what that was the whole thing.
[02:05:56] I didn't give me my black belt up in here. I know it's going to get America. I know the
[02:06:01] gui-atine. I know the rear naked choke. I'm good. What? What? Give me my black belt. And then you get
[02:06:08] really good at it. And the better you get, the more you realize, I don't know some stuff. I don't know
[02:06:14] a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff. I thought that way. And that's the way this is. That's the way this is.
[02:06:22] And then you get the, and like I said, the biggest thing I don't watch out for is that trap.
[02:06:25] And we got to avoid the trap and speaking of avoiding the trap and speaking of staying on the path.
[02:06:33] Echo Charles, if we want to avoid the trap of complacency, complacency, we want to improve. We want to
[02:06:40] get better. We want to be better. Recommendations. So complacency and how do I, you know,
[02:06:46] where why does complacency come in as far as working out goes? Because you think you're good.
[02:06:51] You think you're good to go or maybe you don't need it as much or whatever. Because here's a big one.
[02:06:55] There's going to sound kind of offbeat. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. But let's say you get married kids.
[02:07:04] That's an easy one. But my favorite thing is when people tell me, oh man, I was really
[02:07:08] in the G.J. 2, but I got two kids. Yeah. And I was just looking at them. I got four kids.
[02:07:13] What? Yeah. As if, well, I'm old. I've had people got me. I'm just all old now. Like, I will do
[02:07:20] either like I'm 42. I'm like, right? But there's two. There's two kind of reasons or excuses or
[02:07:30] whatever there when they're like, I got kids. That's either saying I don't have time. Well,
[02:07:34] okay. So back to the working out thing when you, when you get after you get married. There's two
[02:07:38] reasons. Kind of like, oh well, my focus is on something else now. They don't mean you like,
[02:07:43] I don't really have time to do these extra curricular things. What I'm going to call it? And then
[02:07:48] the other one is, I don't need to anymore. Because a lot of people that's kind of whether they
[02:07:53] have it consciously or not, it's like, well, I don't need to necessarily be in great shape.
[02:07:57] Because I already have a girl kind of thing because part of their reason is to attract a girl
[02:08:02] easy to insane. And it goes both ways. It's a two-way street, obviously. So that can be one of
[02:08:07] the reasons for complacency. Like, I don't need to stay in shape that much. Most definitely.
[02:08:11] Yeah, I don't need to lift heavy anymore. Not to say you should be lifting heavy, not to say,
[02:08:16] you should it be. But I'm just saying that's a potential excuse. Seems like,
[02:08:21] anyway lifting heavy or not, doing jiu-jitsu or not. Because some of us are not doing jiu-jitsu.
[02:08:27] Not recommended, but those are the facts. Some of them. I mean, it's not recommended to not do
[02:08:31] jiu-jitsu. Correct. That's a problem. But those are the facts. Some of the time, seems like saying,
[02:08:36] well, last. Do you find it weird that I said here and say that these kind of connections that
[02:08:42] opened the door to begin to understand some of this stuff came from this weird thing where you
[02:08:47] roll around on the floor with another person and try and choke them. Yeah. It's kind of weird, right?
[02:08:53] Yeah, you know, from maybe, yeah, from the outside, I can see that. But the inside, you're like,
[02:08:58] probably this thing is just completely explaining jiu-jitsu. You know what's a weird parallel as well.
[02:09:04] It's like lifting weights and just your human body. The human body, how it works is like the same thing.
[02:09:10] It's like a team of systems. That's true. Doing one thing for the other, you know. And they have to
[02:09:15] cover and move for each other. They got a adapt. It's like all this stuff. Anyway, it's painting
[02:09:20] human body. You need supplements. If you're going hard in the paint on the path, you used to say
[02:09:25] supplementation. It was kind of one of your go-to words. And now you're gone back, you know,
[02:09:30] now you're just saying like supplements. Yeah. Yeah. Does that sound more like marketing? I don't know.
[02:09:36] I just was really used to you saying supplementation, which was not a normal thing to say. It seems
[02:09:41] like maybe you're just sort of falling in with the norm. Maybe you got peer pressured. Maybe.
[02:09:46] All right. Well, let's go back to supplementation because now they just said it. You're good now.
[02:09:50] The way you just feel like you're back. I feel like you're back. I'm back.
[02:09:54] Cool. Well, you saying it kind of brought it to light. Like, yeah, I kind of like how supplementation sounds.
[02:09:59] You seem saying when you're on the path in the game, going hard, which we are, you know,
[02:10:04] unless we're not on all the fun. Did you lift today? I did not lift weights today. I'm going to lift
[02:10:08] your head. Yeah. Hardcore. Well, yeah. For sure. Till failure. Anyway, you joined sometimes. Take a
[02:10:14] beating, right? Supplementation will help that. As Dave Berks has no factor. We got supplementation for that.
[02:10:22] Joint warfare, super-cryoteleïve, which I took both of today. I'm on the routine. Of course.
[02:10:27] I got some help from you, obviously, but, you know, some people out on the interwebs, out on the field,
[02:10:32] you know, they're demonstrating that they can stick to that routine, leaving it out on the, uh,
[02:10:37] oh, did you make adjustments? Yes, sir. You got to bring your bathroom now? No. Where?
[02:10:41] On the counter. In the kitchen. We're always come down. I always come down. Seems like.
[02:10:45] But the last bathroom was just a no-go, non-starter. Well, you know, like to be eaten stuff
[02:10:50] on your bathroom, even if just a little capsule. Given my current routine. Yeah.
[02:10:56] I said, I said, go pills to be a little bright, little feel like a original thing.
[02:11:01] And I don't like to take you. So there's that I didn't know this. There's a difference in a capsule,
[02:11:07] which has the little coating. It's got stuff inside it. And it pilles like a hard thing, right?
[02:11:14] And they're a little bit harder. Swallow or whatever. I found the capsules are hard.
[02:11:19] Oh, really? I found it. Well, that's too bad. You're not in charge of a supplement company.
[02:11:26] Because the original go pills that he made were, I said, hey, make these things. I want to,
[02:11:30] you know, have this stuff in just a little bit, but making it, make it, you know, smaller. So
[02:11:34] the whole story was, hey, man, you know this Dave, you don't want to, you don't have to drink a
[02:11:41] drink before you go and present to a group for two, a half hours. Because you don't want to say,
[02:11:46] hey, can I even hold on to a little bio-breaker? No. In fact, when people tell me,
[02:11:52] hey, you know why you're speaking, why you put water up here? And I said, if I drink,
[02:11:55] if I have to drink during the next one hour, if I go hold on the second wall and presenting,
[02:12:01] I need to take a drink right now. Because my voice is dry. If I have to do that, we got a problem.
[02:12:05] I failed. You're not, you don't want to, you're not sitting there to see me drink. We're not drinking.
[02:12:12] Now if I'm a during the master, I'm on stage for six hours. Yeah, we're up there drinking and
[02:12:17] chilling and whatever. Plus you guys are taking turns. Yeah. Yeah. But the, so the go pills,
[02:12:24] I said, hey, man, I can't be drinking a drink, filling my bladder up wall. I'm, you know, before
[02:12:30] I was, I don't want to have to stop. Can you make something compact, compressed? There you go.
[02:12:35] That's the Dispongo in a pill format. Get that, get that mine.
[02:12:41] A ranking. So just to be clear, the Displing Go is a pill or a capsule. It is a capsule.
[02:12:47] Okay. So the original one that be little made was a pill, because that's what I had requested.
[02:12:53] I told them the wrong thing. I didn't understand the difference. I don't know the language. Okay. So pill,
[02:12:59] compressed, yes. capsule is a capsule that you can unscrew and take the powder out. Jell cap.
[02:13:05] Oh, yes. Yes. So and divide them in those are gel caps. Yes. They are different. So the three
[02:13:12] delivery methodologies. Just to be clear. Yeah. Okay. There you go. So nonetheless, these things will help you
[02:13:21] on the path. Big time. Also, again, we mentioned the D3. Boom, that's it. Every, that's a daily.
[02:13:27] Those are small too. So that's like kind of like no excuse. You know some people that like
[02:13:30] I'm right. So I'm going to peel some people like that. This one, no factor. It's a gel cap,
[02:13:36] which is our use. I used to take, I used to take pills one at a time. One, like so I would take
[02:13:42] whatever seven or eight pills. Right. So you, I would take one. One. Why just, just, I just didn't like it.
[02:13:48] Kind of like what you're saying. I was one of those people. And then I realized it was inefficient.
[02:13:52] It is. And I had to overcome this, you know, scenario. I'll tell you the technique to swallow pills.
[02:13:57] You swallow 10 pills at once if you want. Well, I've never tried it, but I'm saying given the theory
[02:14:02] theoretically. Because I, what do I take? And this is all I want. Two, two, two,
[02:14:07] divitements. Oh, you take two of those? Yeah. I take, okay. Go ahead.
[02:14:11] A three, acrylic oil. Three joint warfare. And everyone's on all, don't throw into cold war.
[02:14:19] So what is that? Two, six. I don't know. I didn't do the math nonetheless. It's a lot. Let's say it's six.
[02:14:24] Yeah, I take all those at once. Yeah. All you got to do is when you drink your water with it,
[02:14:28] wait, you drink water with it? Yep. Yeah, that, you know, some guys are advanced. They just boom.
[02:14:31] Yeah, that's one speed. That's an hardcore dude. Yeah. But we're not all there. So we're going to drink
[02:14:36] our water with it. But, bro, all you do, some people, they lean their head back. Oh, here's the thing. When you
[02:14:41] lean your head back like that, the narrowed, the goat chamber. No, well, I don't know, maybe
[02:14:46] me not, but that's not what I found as far as feel. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[02:14:51] those capsules that you talk about, they float in the water. You want it to sink really,
[02:14:57] the pills sink just if they're coated with something. God, it's like anyway. So if you go straight
[02:15:02] up straight back, boom, the delcaps float sometimes they don't go, go down. Interesting. This is
[02:15:07] what you do. You turn your head to the side. Okay. So you don't say it, no, because look, it's still
[02:15:15] floats, but since it's to the side, it's in the side of your throat, not on the top of it. So it goes down
[02:15:20] easier. Five pills. I'm still doing every day. One speeder I was thinking, I knew how to take
[02:15:26] capsules. Yeah. Now I learned the truth. I guess technically I shouldn't even say that's the best
[02:15:31] one. So currently that is the leading way. My little daughter was getting sick. And I said,
[02:15:37] hey, you need to take some cold water. And so then she does not like to take pills or capsules.
[02:15:43] And I said, no problem. I am broken open, mix it up in water. It was wider. You cannot do this.
[02:15:50] Because it is because there's garlic in there, like a lot of garlic, which is an awesome ingredient
[02:15:57] to have. But man, I mixed it up and it was nasty. Try it with one just to cut it, just to cut it, see.
[02:16:06] That would be a that would be an exercise in discipline. Just mix up cold water pills and just
[02:16:11] drink them like shots. Yeah. Man, I think maybe sprinkle a month of eggs or something. Some baking
[02:16:17] or something. That might be actually interesting. Interesting concept. But that's the thing.
[02:16:21] I'm sure cold water is not just garlic powder. Yeah, no, for sure. There's some like actual
[02:16:27] that's when you mix it with water and smell it. You smell it. And then you take it off.
[02:16:34] Well, nonetheless, however you choose to take these things, they will help you 100% in the game on the path.
[02:16:41] I'm just saying, don't forget about milk protein, the form of these are protein,
[02:16:45] additional protein. Not like you're not eating protein ever. If you weren't, it would be
[02:16:50] bone now you are. Yeah. There you go. When else chocolate, yes, we're dead lifting.
[02:16:59] But like we're not dead lifting. No, we're not. I should be dead lifting. We should be. I think so.
[02:17:04] That's my opinion too. Well, when it's chocolate, you have to do with that because it allows you
[02:17:09] to deadlifate thousand pounds. Is it eight? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the guarantee. Could be right.
[02:17:15] It could be more. If you go harder, I guess. And you get all this stuff at the vitamin shop,
[02:17:18] the vitamin shop in your local A.L. Area of Operations. Yes, sir. Also at originmean.com. If you
[02:17:26] don't want to go to the vitamin shop, you want the delivery system to your door.
[02:17:31] And you go, yeah, originmean.com. Also at originmean.com is due to stuff,
[02:17:37] geese, rash guards. There's t-shirts and other clothes or whatever, but more importantly,
[02:17:45] actually not importantly, but additionally, significantly, additionally, genes and boots.
[02:17:51] There's something else coming. You probably don't even know about because you're not really like,
[02:17:58] you know, they're like, good relationship. It's in this circle. So, you know, the material
[02:18:04] that the ghee pants are made of, it's called atomic twill. So, and it's durable enough to be
[02:18:12] ghee pants obviously. And I was like, Pete, what do you think? I could use just a pair of pants.
[02:18:21] So, he made them and they are freaking legit. Yeah, like work pants, but they're, yeah, they're basically
[02:18:28] just pants, but they're not genes. Yeah, they're in jail. Yeah, they'll be coming. That'll be working.
[02:18:34] Yeah, yeah. Yes, all made in America, by the way, which is a big deal. Fabric, cotton,
[02:18:39] grown in America all the way to the, to the, to the deal. What about, what about, like, the things that
[02:18:45] you put together to make them stay up? You know what I mean? There's a certain thing there. What's
[02:18:51] that called? No, no, what you're talking about? What's it called? That keeps the two pieces of cotton
[02:18:55] fabric together. What's it called? I don't know. Not a zipper. About the zipper is the,
[02:19:01] what? The button. That's right. Yeah. The buttons. Yes, even the buttons are made in America.
[02:19:06] Yeah, works of art. Really function and fashion. As a word. No less. What do you mean?
[02:19:11] Duckcomps where you get all this good stuff. Also, we're going to getting good stuff. Wait, Dave,
[02:19:17] how'd you like the Yajako Palmer? You're going to go go cam. I liked it. Is it, is it the top
[02:19:23] of your list? Or you, because you're on a, what, tax average? What? Where we are? No hit on, on, on
[02:19:28] tax average, but I was doing some traffic thunder. But now that, now that,
[02:19:34] Palmer's in the can, that's number one. That was just just went to the top. Well, dude,
[02:19:39] Palmer powders all I had. Yeah. And the thing about go is like, I get them, because I'm going somewhere.
[02:19:47] I'm on the go. So I'm on time to mix up the powder all the time. The powder was like,
[02:19:51] almost a treat almost like milk. Yeah. So I'm like, I got time here. I'm going to get crushed
[02:19:55] ice. I'm going to get the powder. I'm going to mix it up. I got some time. And I'm going to just,
[02:19:59] now, just done. Oh, dude. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with the Jako Palmer scenario. Like,
[02:20:06] it's, you was kind of surprisingly good. You know, when you think, oh, yeah. Oh, I just do
[02:20:11] you lemon cool. Nice. Nothing new. Hey, there's nothing new to me. Boom. Take a hit. The
[02:20:18] song is greater than the song. What is it? The parts, you, you feel I'm saying, but anyway, it was
[02:20:23] that sort of situation. It's good. Okay. Anyway, speaking of good Jako is a store,
[02:20:27] called Jako Star. This is where you can get your teacher. It's Hats.
[02:20:32] Other cool stuff on there that represent on the path. This Blinny goes freedom.

[02:21:07] That's what everybody wants me to do. Yeah. Put a pod in the paywall. They, they, they want that
[02:21:13] because all the podcasts are now the new media stuff. Yeah. So well.
[02:21:20] They're doing levels of it. We don't want to do that. We just want to do what we're doing. Yeah.
[02:21:26] And in order to do what we're doing a little support. It's nice on that one. Hey, if you,
[02:21:32] and speaking of this podcast, subscribe to a check it out. Echo Charles thinks that's important
[02:21:37] for me to say right now. I don't think it's unimportant. How about that? We also have another podcast
[02:21:43] that's out right now. It's called the unravelling. The Jako unravelling podcast,
[02:21:48] Dereau Cooper and me talking about things in the world and how things in the world, when you unravel
[02:21:55] them, you find out where they came from, why they're happening and it gives you better understanding
[02:21:59] of the things that are happening right now. Used to be called the threat. We had to change the name.
[02:22:05] There's also ground to podcasts, which we haven't recorded a while, but we're doing it on the
[02:22:09] warrior kid podcasts as well. No, forget about the warrior kid soap made by Aiden. Who's up there in a
[02:22:14] farm taking goat milk at a young age with a running a business so that the entire world
[02:22:25] can stay clean. We have a YouTube channel where Echo Charles is supposed to make videos
[02:22:33] and he does sometimes. We'll say, sure. I'm not going to argue with the one.
[02:22:38] Some of them have explosions. Music, some have music and other enhancements. Skeletons.
[02:22:48] Sure. Fire. Tanks. Aircraft. Yeah. Unless some don't. Yeah. And everyone that thinks
[02:22:59] that Echo Charles should put one Easter egg. One, there pleasant surprise into these three-hour podcasts.
[02:23:09] Like when Dave Burke says a mortar exploded, there should be a mortar exploding in this room.
[02:23:17] This momentarily. And then the conversation continues. A lot of people think that's what should
[02:23:23] happen. So we all have a little bit of fun when we're watching a three-hour. Yeah. Well,
[02:23:30] so I will keep exploring that as an option for sure. So one else. Oh, yes. Psychological
[02:23:37] warfare. Don't forget about that one. Hey, when you don't feel like lifting, Brad, all of
[02:23:42] me yesterday straight up didn't feel like lifting today. But I did. Yeah. But you already have
[02:23:48] psychology for for planning ahead on repeat. You know what I was doing? Yes. I do. No,
[02:23:53] unfortunately. If you wanted in your head, maybe not a repeat. Maybe repeat for a little bit
[02:23:57] in this I get it. Go to like wherever you can buy MP3's Amazon. You know Google Play All these places.
[02:24:02] Get psychological warfare by Jocca Willing. What it is is Jocca will talk in your ear telling you
[02:24:08] why you shouldn't skip the workout, why you shouldn't eat a donut, pound that donut or the whole
[02:24:13] box or whatever. Another butter cookies. You know you get different. Oh, no, let's see. You know,
[02:24:21] gently, pragmatically, logically bring you past those moments of weakness and boom, you get you get
[02:24:27] stuff done. It's really good. 100% effective too. By the way. Flipside Canvas. If you want some kind of
[02:24:33] message to hang on your wall, my brother Dakota Myers making it for you. All kinds of messages,
[02:24:39] important messages. Check that out, flipsidecamus.com. Got some books. One of them was written by this
[02:24:47] guy right over here. Dave Burke. The code. The code the evaluation of the protocols. What do you
[02:24:53] got? What do you got Dave? Dave, it's still getting a ton of messages from troopers who are still
[02:24:57] on the path and in the game. It's so legit to hear. Has something as small as this little wood
[02:25:04] field guide? Yeah, field guide. We weren't really sure what to call. No, but it's been you. It's
[02:25:10] useful. Yeah, which has been awesome. So keep those messages coming in. I love here. Yeah, this is like
[02:25:16] one of those things where, you know, I called it like a reminder almost, but it's kind of like
[02:25:20] okay, cool. A reminder doesn't make that much of an impact maybe on your mind, but think about it
[02:25:24] every day at the let's say at the end of the day, right? Most of us don't think every single day.
[02:25:29] Most of us don't think, how do I do today? How did I do today in all these like critical areas
[02:25:37] as far as like making an improvement in what you're even doing? Imagine if you were part of
[02:25:42] anything and you never assessed that thing. Yeah. Doesn't even compute. Imagine if you wanted to make
[02:25:48] something better. You would assess that thing and see where you could improve it. Now imagine that
[02:25:53] the most important thing we have is our lives and people go through their whole lives without assessing
[02:25:58] where they are, who they are, what they're doing, where they're going. Most important thing you need
[02:26:03] to know on the battlefield is where you are. Yeah. Then you can move forward. Yeah. That's the, that's
[02:26:11] the protocols in this book. It's funny like you know when you're like your kid and you're trying to like,
[02:26:16] I don't know, make the football team right and then you have like try out switch it, you know, a day
[02:26:20] or a week or what is sometimes a week or whatever and after every little session you like come home
[02:26:26] and you're like, how did I do how did I do how did I do? That's just for some intro mural football game.
[02:26:30] We're talking about life. Same same thing. You would think it'd be more obvious. You would think,
[02:26:35] yeah, that book, that that book would just be, hey, this is, hey, what are you guys doing writing?
[02:26:39] This is, there's, you know, there's this already exists. Yeah. What are you doing writing this?
[02:26:44] It doesn't exist. Now it does. The code the evaluation protocols. They've Burke, leadership
[02:26:50] strategy and tactics. What percentage of questions that you get in your constant leadership as a,
[02:26:56] as a leadership instructor, as a leadership coach, as an executive coach, what percentage of
[02:27:03] questions are answered that you have to answer that you could either answer on the fly and say, hey,
[02:27:10] here's a good way to look at it or you could if you had an extra 14 second say, hold on a second,
[02:27:15] go to page 237 and leadership strategy and tactics. What's the percentage? It's a big number.
[02:27:24] I don't want to do the math. It's a big number. I don't want to say it's all there because that would be
[02:27:29] that be a lot to say it's all there, but it's there. And if it's not exactly there, there's a version
[02:27:36] of it that's there that will fit wherever you are. The other side of just just read that book.
[02:27:42] Just read it and it's there. Yeah, I think what's good about that book is this stuff that
[02:27:49] we're talking about today where you have to pull these other things and you kind of want to start
[02:27:54] fitting them together. I think this that book is a good step of taking these various principles
[02:28:01] and starting to see how they play into the world, which I think is a good thing. Yes, kids,
[02:28:08] you might have kids, you might know kids, you might as well get them on the path.
[02:28:13] Way of the warrior kid, one, two and three. Those are available. Those are helpful.
[02:28:21] I'm telling you right now, if you could get a kid, these books, you are going to change the
[02:28:29] trajectory of their lives. And I know that's an arrogant and an an an an an a bold statement to make,
[02:28:34] but I hear it all the time from parents, from teachers and from kids themselves.
[02:28:43] It's it's just just please just get it for the kids, get it for the kids. And then if you're
[02:28:50] going to smaller kid, think about what it's like being a small kid, the world. You have to
[02:28:55] contend with the world. It's a scary place. We have fears to overcome Mikey and the dragons teach
[02:29:00] kids how to overcome fear. This point of course, freedom field manual, how to get after it
[02:29:07] for adults and extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership, the fundamental principles of
[02:29:12] combat leadership that we talk about all the time that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
[02:29:15] We have Escelon front leadership consultancy. What do we do there, Dave? We teach leadership.
[02:29:21] Now we help make the connection between all this stuff and the world that these people are
[02:29:25] living in and it's the coolest thing in the world because I get to think about this stuff. We get
[02:29:31] to think about this stuff all the time, just just completely awesome. Real world application. Yes.
[02:29:38] On a daily basis, into a multitude of scenarios and the outcomes are always the same. It's like,
[02:29:44] yes, we actually know what to do there. We can help you. Go to go to Escelonfront.com for that.
[02:29:54] And look, you don't have to necessarily have us to come to you or you don't necessarily have to
[02:29:59] come to us. We had to cancel one of our monsters that bummed a lot of people out, meet you, all of us.
[02:30:04] We got bummed out. But this is this is 2020. We are online, EF online, all the stuff that we're
[02:30:14] talking about when you need direct contact to help get through things, to improve your leadership
[02:30:22] capability, to improve your team's leadership capability, to get you all aligned. Go to EF online.com.
[02:30:29] You might be thinking that, oh, that sounds like something where I'll go on there and
[02:30:35] and watch a video about something. And you will go. You can go and watch videos. But you can also
[02:30:40] come and ask Dave Burke a question. You can come and ask me a question. You can argue with me.
[02:30:46] You can say, actually, Jockel, cover, move, didn't work from you in the situation.
[02:30:50] I will gladly discuss this with you. That is what we are doing with EF online. So it's awesome.
[02:30:58] What I'm going to say. If you talked about it, because we have a whole new platform right now for
[02:31:04] EF online, good point. Yes. The feedback we're getting on that is how easy it is for people
[02:31:13] out there to connect with us directly in real time. Not to talk theory, not to talk principle,
[02:31:18] but to talk. I'm having this actual problem or can you help me? Yes, I can. And then we're getting,
[02:31:24] we're getting feedback, we're getting sit-rubs. Sit-rubs. Hey, the thing you told me yesterday,
[02:31:29] I just did it. It worked. Thanks. And if you haven't, you need to tell people about this,
[02:31:35] because the EF online access is so legit. It's growing quickly. But it's growing because
[02:31:40] one of the other cool things about it is that we'll get a question. We'll get a question like
[02:31:44] little chat box. Dave, got a question. But I'll be answering another question. Before I get to that
[02:31:50] next question, five other people, other troopers have said, hey, had the same problem at my job.
[02:31:56] This is what I did. And by the time I go to answer it, five of the troopers have already
[02:32:00] engaged and helped them and given them some, so the interaction between the other troopers
[02:32:05] is just as good as the interaction with us. Yeah, and all that stuff is taking place. We have a
[02:32:08] forum in there too. So all that stuff, you can go in there and say, hey, my boss just told me to
[02:32:13] do this. This is what I think. And you know, one of us EF instructors or one of the other troopers,
[02:32:19] you know, oh, you know what? I'm in HR. I'm the HR chief at my company. Here's what you should think
[02:32:25] about. So it's just an awesome format. It's an awesome thing. And even though we had to cancel one
[02:32:30] monster, we do, we are going to do the Phoenix Monster, September 16th and 17th, Dallas, December
[02:32:36] third and fourth, go to extremeownership.com for details. Look, it's probably going to be social distancing.
[02:32:40] We're not going to have a bunch of seats or we're going to have to get, we have to put away a bunch of
[02:32:43] seats. So it's going to sell out quicker than normal. So if you want to come check it out, say,

[02:34:14] Dave is at David R. Burke. Echos out of which I was an I am at Jocca Willink and thank you to all
[02:34:21] the men and women in uniform throughout history who learned these lessons in blood and pass them
[02:34:29] onto our modern warriors who put them to use, put these lessons to use to keep peace in the world
[02:34:38] and to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers
[02:34:42] and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service. Thanks to all of you for making
[02:34:48] sure we have peace here at home and to everyone else out there, remember these lessons and first
[02:34:59] and foremost remember how this book started that the Paramount Combat lesson learned from
[02:35:06] every operation is the vital importance of leadership. Aggressive and determined leadership is the
[02:35:16] priceless factor which inspires command and upon which all success in battle depends.
[02:35:28] Leadership is responsible for success or failure so don't fall into the trap.
[02:35:35] We are not good enough go out there and be better. And until next time this is Dave and Echo and
[02:35:49] Jockel out.
