[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 265 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:05] Good evening, Echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] And also joining us tonight is Dave Burk, Good evening, Dave.
[00:00:10] Good evening.
[00:00:11] So last podcast, we introduced Marine Corps,
[00:00:15] Doctional Publication at One Tack for, which is called,
[00:00:17] Competing.
[00:00:19] And of course, we only made it one chapter deep because,
[00:00:22] well, there's a lot to go into.
[00:00:24] And so we're going to continue on.
[00:00:27] But first, we're going to take a little tangential trip
[00:00:31] into my head a little bit.
[00:00:32] So in reading that manual and as I talked about this,
[00:00:37] I started correlating competing with influencing.
[00:00:42] And you take that one step further, which isn't very,
[00:00:44] a very big step.
[00:00:46] What is influencing?
[00:00:47] Influencing is leading.
[00:00:48] That's what you're doing.
[00:00:50] So one of the main things that I liked about this Marine
[00:00:55] Corps concept of competing was this idea
[00:00:57] of this continuum of competition that they present in this book.
[00:01:00] That goes from pure peace on one side, just pure peace.
[00:01:06] And then it starts to move to the right.
[00:01:08] It goes to economic competition in then classic diplomacy
[00:01:12] and then political warfare.
[00:01:14] And then there's this gray zone and you get into hybrid war.
[00:01:17] And then you get into the threat of violence.
[00:01:19] And then you finally cross the,
[00:01:22] what they call the violence threshold.
[00:01:24] And then to, so you're now you're using violence.
[00:01:28] And then even violence has a place that expands on this continuum.
[00:01:36] It goes to from conventional war and then it keeps going further
[00:01:40] and further to the right to you get to total war,
[00:01:42] where one side is using any in all means.
[00:01:45] And that's certainly completely destroyed there.
[00:01:47] I mean.
[00:01:49] And so with that, I started thinking about
[00:01:54] the continuum of influence or the continuum of leadership
[00:02:01] that we have to use every day to lead an influence people.
[00:02:06] And it draws some very interesting parallels
[00:02:12] to the continuum of competition at the Marine Corps
[00:02:14] talks about and there's one specific mark in there
[00:02:18] that really showed a lot of similarities to me.
[00:02:21] So if we look at this continuum from the beginning,
[00:02:26] like on the far side, you have someone that you don't care about.
[00:02:30] You don't care what they're doing.
[00:02:32] You're not trying to influence them.
[00:02:33] You don't want them to do anything at all.
[00:02:35] You just don't care.
[00:02:36] They're off their like, off the spectrum.
[00:02:38] I guess they're touching it, but they're not on it yet.
[00:02:40] So we don't have to worry about them.
[00:02:41] We don't care what they're doing at all.
[00:02:44] Now, as soon as you cross that first little threshold
[00:02:48] and now you've got someone that you want to influence.
[00:02:53] You want them to follow a plan or you want them to execute an action
[00:02:56] or you want them to execute a behavior.
[00:02:59] So now we're on to the continuum of influence
[00:03:01] or the continuum of leadership.
[00:03:03] So what does it start with?
[00:03:06] Well, it starts with we're trying to build a relationship
[00:03:08] with that person.
[00:03:08] That's where we're going to begin.
[00:03:09] And what's interesting, what's the best way
[00:03:11] to start building a relationship with someone?
[00:03:12] You let them start to influence you.
[00:03:14] So as soon as you're saying, hey, that's a good,
[00:03:16] I like that, I like what you're doing.
[00:03:18] And you're there's that.
[00:03:20] You've heard of this thing mirroring.
[00:03:21] Have you heard this?
[00:03:23] So mirroring is the physical.
[00:03:25] Oh, if Dave's hit the sitin with his hand
[00:03:26] on his cheek, then I do the same thing.
[00:03:29] And it's a little indicator.
[00:03:31] I'm allowing you to see that you're kind of influencing
[00:03:33] me and it's a positive thing.
[00:03:34] So that's the base thing right there.
[00:03:37] A physical, actual mimicry of what you're doing, mirroring
[00:03:41] what you're doing.
[00:03:42] And that's my first way of showing you that.
[00:03:43] I'm allowing you a little influence.
[00:03:44] So now that's starting to build a good rapport between us.
[00:03:48] So that's like the lowest level.
[00:03:52] And then what am I going to do?
[00:03:53] I'm going to listen what you have to say.
[00:03:54] And so I'm starting to build this relationship
[00:03:56] and people don't think this way.
[00:03:57] People miss this, right?
[00:03:58] People don't understand that when I mirror you
[00:04:00] and when I listen to you, I'm actually
[00:04:01] starting to gain influence.
[00:04:02] People totally miss that all the time.
[00:04:04] They completely miss that.
[00:04:06] But that's level one, right?
[00:04:07] It's incredibly important level.
[00:04:10] But it's level whatever point zero zero eight or whatever
[00:04:15] that numbers.
[00:04:17] So we're just listening.
[00:04:18] We're letting them model where we're mirroring their behavior
[00:04:21] a little bit.
[00:04:22] Eventually as we start to escalate, we start to model
[00:04:27] our behavior for them a little bit.
[00:04:29] But we start acting a certain way.
[00:04:30] We're not asking you to do it.
[00:04:31] We're just doing it.
[00:04:33] And we're hoping that that influence
[00:04:37] rubs off on the other person and now they start to do the
[00:04:43] same thing.
[00:04:44] And this is another thing that you can do.
[00:04:47] You do it subconsciously, maybe do it consciously.
[00:04:49] But people are in a line at a grocery store.
[00:04:55] And a new line opens up.
[00:04:58] And if no one sees it, if you just,
[00:05:01] if no one sees it, you can just walk over to that line
[00:05:03] and then people see it and they kind of model your behavior
[00:05:05] and you're kind of influenced
[00:05:06] like a bunch of people that you don't even know.
[00:05:07] But it's just a way of modeling behavior
[00:05:11] and setting this over here all the time, right?
[00:05:13] Set the example.
[00:05:14] Set a good example.
[00:05:15] That's a good way to lead.
[00:05:16] For sure, that's outstanding.
[00:05:21] Eventually though, maybe that's not enough, right?
[00:05:24] Maybe we're trying to influence someone to do something,
[00:05:30] either follow a plan, adjust their behavior, take a certain action.
[00:05:38] If we're trying to get someone to do that,
[00:05:40] and they haven't really followed our modeling,
[00:05:42] now we got to start escalating and going a little bit harder.
[00:05:45] So that's a little bit harder.
[00:05:46] Well, asking good questions, asking earnest questions.
[00:05:50] Oh, hey, hey, Dave, why do you do this like that?
[00:05:52] And it's just a way.
[00:05:54] And then listen so that as Dave explains to me
[00:05:57] why he's doing something a certain way,
[00:05:58] maybe it reveals to him, because now he's looking at it
[00:06:01] from a detached perspective.
[00:06:03] That's an amazing thing about asking someone a question.
[00:06:05] When you ask someone a question,
[00:06:06] it detaches them from what they're doing.
[00:06:10] That's what makes it such a powerful tool.
[00:06:12] Because when Dave is just sitting there with his pen
[00:06:14] and he's fiddling with his pen,
[00:06:15] he's not even noticing that he's doing it,
[00:06:16] which he's literally doing right now.
[00:06:17] But as soon as I say, hey, if I didn't want him to do that,
[00:06:20] if it was blurring the camera or something,
[00:06:21] hey, why are you, why you keep fiddling with that pen?
[00:06:25] He has to detach to actually figure out why he's doing it.
[00:06:28] Which is a great thing,
[00:06:30] because we always want people to detach
[00:06:32] and see things from the outside.
[00:06:34] So just asking an earnest question is a really good
[00:06:37] escalation on this continuum that we're going through.
[00:06:44] Now, that little question and answer session that we're having
[00:06:49] kind of leads to a discussion where we're actually
[00:06:51] having a discussion, well, you know,
[00:06:52] sometimes I just like to fidget.
[00:06:54] It makes me think, oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:55] So we can have a, we can have an actual conversation.
[00:06:58] And that whole discussion that we're having,
[00:07:00] if I'm utilizing this correctly,
[00:07:04] I'm guiding you, I'm guiding Dave, in this case,
[00:07:08] I'm guiding Dave to discover what I'm trying,
[00:07:13] I want you to discover the fact that, hey,
[00:07:15] if you're fidgeting with that pen,
[00:07:16] people aren't even paying attention to what you're saying
[00:07:18] and it's making noise on camera and it's like,
[00:07:20] I want you to discover those things.
[00:07:21] And I want you to actually tell me about them,
[00:07:23] because then it comes from you,
[00:07:24] and that's infinitely more powerful.
[00:07:29] So, but sometimes it doesn't work.
[00:07:32] And sometimes even though someone detaches,
[00:07:33] they just don't, they can't get far enough away from that thing.
[00:07:36] So where does it go from there?
[00:07:37] Well, now I'm going to maybe offer an indirect,
[00:07:40] little statement about what's going on.
[00:07:43] You know, just a little, you know,
[00:07:46] do you think it's distracting when you do that?
[00:07:49] With someone's watching you?
[00:07:51] I've always found that distracting,
[00:07:55] if someone's talking to me, but they're fidgeting.
[00:07:57] So now I'm just, I'm going to little, it's indirect,
[00:08:00] but it still is, I'm starting to put a little bit more pressure
[00:08:03] with that statement, and of course,
[00:08:04] now what I'm going to do, and we'll listen what you have to say.
[00:08:07] And so where does it escalate from there?
[00:08:09] Now Dave's still not paying attention to what I'm saying.
[00:08:12] He's still just sitting there fidgeting with the pen,
[00:08:14] and it's distracting to everyone, it's making noise,
[00:08:16] and it's messing up the focus, the camera's all kinds of problems.
[00:08:19] But Dave doesn't care, or whatever, he hasn't seen it yet.
[00:08:23] So then maybe we escalate a little bit more,
[00:08:27] and now, you know, it's my metaphors about to lose a little bit of traction,
[00:08:31] because that's such a minor thing that this next step,
[00:08:37] well, to say, hey, why don't we make a pro,
[00:08:39] like a pro and con list about fidgeting your pen, right?
[00:08:43] Now if we were talking about, you know,
[00:08:46] going into a new market area with a business,
[00:08:48] and you were like, hey, we're going, we're going, we're going,
[00:08:50] we're going in, I had tried to influence you,
[00:08:51] and I tried to ask you questions about it,
[00:08:52] and I couldn't get you there.
[00:08:54] Then my next escalation might be,
[00:08:55] hey, why don't we do a pros and cons on that?
[00:08:58] I'm still not coming at you.
[00:09:00] I'm just asking, asking, like, hey, why don't we do some pros and cons?
[00:09:04] That way, once again, what am I doing?
[00:09:05] You're going to have to detach you a pros and cons,
[00:09:07] this is one of the benefits of doing a pros and cons list.
[00:09:09] Is it detaches you, takes some of those emotions away,
[00:09:12] and now we're sitting here saying, okay, Dave is detached to say,
[00:09:17] well, these are some positive things, it helps me think,
[00:09:19] it gives me something to do with my hands,
[00:09:22] or let's go to the market area.
[00:09:23] Hey, here's the positive things about the market area.
[00:09:25] We don't have any stores there.
[00:09:27] There seems to be a decent market, here's the cons,
[00:09:29] it's going to, that's high rents in that area, whatever.
[00:09:31] So now you can start to reveal, you reveal,
[00:09:36] instead of me revealing you, hey, man, the rents over there are ridiculous.
[00:09:39] Instead of me revealing that to you, which offends you?
[00:09:42] In general, it offends people to just tell them anything.
[00:09:45] It's much better when you tell me, now all of a sudden it's your idea,
[00:09:48] and this is a beautiful thing.
[00:09:51] So that's like sort of the next thing.
[00:09:53] It's sort of another little level of escalation that you could do on this continual.
[00:09:57] Where I'm moving in that direction, I'm still trying to indirectly influence you.
[00:10:04] And maybe the next thing I do is offer some kind of a bargain,
[00:10:09] some kind of a negotiation, where I say, hey, you know,
[00:10:13] maybe now is not the right time to go in that market, or maybe we look at it next quarter.
[00:10:17] Right, so it's a little negotiation to try and see if, if I can get you to think a little bit more about it.
[00:10:24] It's just an negotiation.
[00:10:28] And look, maybe you go, yeah, yeah, because maybe you saw just enough,
[00:10:31] maybe you saw, maybe it just revealed just enough of the problems that you're going,
[00:10:34] you know, maybe we do, you know, do this.
[00:10:37] Maybe we may move away with the next quarter.
[00:10:38] Yeah, we can do that.
[00:10:40] And there's another little technique that's going on there too,
[00:10:42] which is I'm giving you now, right?
[00:10:44] Yeah, well, wait, next. Yeah, that's probably a good idea, right?
[00:10:46] So you are sort of, you start to see some of those issues, but you don't want to
[00:10:50] concede that your idea was not good.
[00:10:53] So instead, you just concede that it will just push it off a little bit, but it's still a good idea.
[00:10:57] So that way your ego remains intact and it's all good.
[00:11:01] But maybe you didn't catch that.
[00:11:04] So now we're going to start to brush up against,
[00:11:07] we're starting to brush up against me being just direct with you,
[00:11:13] which is revealing some shortfalls, like just saying to you, hey, you know,
[00:11:18] the rents in that area are really high and by the way, two similar businesses went into that market
[00:11:25] and both of them washed out and that happened in the last 18 months.
[00:11:29] Those are real concerns.
[00:11:33] And even when I do that, so now I'm showing you, like,
[00:11:35] those are no longer things that you revealed.
[00:11:37] Those are now things that I'm telling you.
[00:11:39] So this is a transition and, and I'm sure you're tracking this, but this whole thing is
[00:11:46] interlaced with leadership capital.
[00:11:48] This whole thing is interlaced. So the other ones, when you, when I allow you to
[00:11:53] reveal something to me, my leadership capital goes up, when I tell you something, my leadership
[00:11:57] capital takes a little, takes a little bit of it, not, not thing crazy, but we're not neutral,
[00:12:03] right, some of those in the middle might be neutral. So I'm still going to give you an out,
[00:12:07] you know, when I say, hey, you know, there's other two other companies we're going to
[00:12:10] have in the last 18 months and then so maybe we should and I give you some time and out,
[00:12:14] you know, maybe we wait another year and I give you some kind of an out where you go, yeah,
[00:12:19] you know, that's probably a good idea.
[00:12:24] So we're still, we still have a possibility that you kind of see
[00:12:28] what a good move is and you're kind of on board with what I'm saying, which is what I'm
[00:12:31] trying to do this whole time is I'm trying to influence you, right, trying to lead you, trying to
[00:12:34] influence you. Then it's just straight up, I'm just going to tell you what the shortfalls are.
[00:12:41] And if that doesn't happen, you know, offer them another option, what's another option to
[00:12:50] their plan, what's another option to their behavior? You know, hey, maybe putting stores directly in
[00:12:57] that neighborhood, how about this one that's, you know, four miles to the north? So yeah, you know,
[00:13:02] that's also a good neighbor. So I give you an out, I give you an option that still kind of
[00:13:06] gratifies your ego and your idea, but at the same time it moves you in a little bit of a direction
[00:13:11] where I want to go. So we're still doing all right. And then the kind of the final sort of indirect
[00:13:18] way is, you know, a, a, Dave, why don't we put one in this market area over here now and then next time
[00:13:28] we'll put one in this marketer that you want to go into. So again, a lot of these are just kind of
[00:13:31] bargaining and kind of repetitive, but they're all different levels of bargaining from, hey, we do this
[00:13:39] later to, hey, we will do this or we hold off. There's a bunch of different ways to bargain through it.
[00:13:44] And then eventually, so now you go through these methods, these attempts to discuss something or
[00:13:53] to influence someone and every one of these attempts is an indirect attempt. Every one of these
[00:14:00] attempts is me trying to get you to kind of come on board with what I'm saying without,
[00:14:06] well, buy your own, buy your own volition. Right. It's your choice that you say, yeah, you know what we
[00:14:14] should do this later or yeah, you know what that, my art market area to the north is good. So all those
[00:14:19] are your choice, every one of these I'm giving you to you, every one of these attempts, but we
[00:14:25] might fail even with all those attempts. And then at some point, you know, so in the Marine Corps,
[00:14:33] what they do is they go through this whole continuum and then they get eventually to this point
[00:14:37] where they cross the threshold of violence. So what does that look like in influence? What does that
[00:14:42] look like in leadership? It's the threshold of going from indirect to direct. And now I am absolutely
[00:14:51] is going to cost me leadership capital. At this time, I'm now, it's not going to cost me leadership
[00:14:55] capital, which hey, look, there's times we have leadership capital in the bank and if I've been
[00:14:59] working with Dave for five years and we've done a bunch of stuff and it's all gone great and he's
[00:15:04] risen up through the company and all of a sudden I got to call in some chips and say hey man,
[00:15:08] you know what we're not doing that and he goes, God, you know, I'm not saying it doesn't cost me
[00:15:13] something but I can afford it. But when you cross the threshold of from indirect to direct,
[00:15:22] now it's definitely going to cost you like I said, you might have money in the bank, but you
[00:15:25] might have leadership capital in the bank, but it's going to cost you. So now, now is when we're saying hey,
[00:15:30] you know what, we're going to have to we cannot go into that marketer. Again, this is the most
[00:15:36] gent toy to do it. It's we, you know, it's us, it's our team, I'm on your side, you know, we, we can't
[00:15:42] go into that market area right now. And you know, then the response could still be, you know,
[00:15:49] if Dave's, if Dave's my subordinate and Dave's start, you know, he most people get to say
[00:15:54] we can't go into it. Most people get to hit and by the way, we'll get to this. The number of times
[00:15:59] that I make it in across the threshold of direct is so, so, so menous, fuel, I can't remember times.
[00:16:10] So most people by the same say, like, we cannot do that. We cannot go into that marketer. They go,
[00:16:15] joc was got a pretty good, oh, yeah, and they, they feel a little bit of it. They feel that
[00:16:19] direct and they immediately say, okay, I got it. I see where, I see where we're going with this. It's not
[00:16:24] happening. Of course, sometimes does work, right? Sometimes you say, no, this, this is what we are doing.
[00:16:34] We are not going in there. And it can even escalate to no Dave, you cannot open up another store
[00:16:39] of that. Now, this is direct. This is it. I'm ordering you because I'm the boss. I'm ordering you,
[00:16:46] we will not go into that market area. We are not going to build a store there. And then you,
[00:16:51] we'll not do that. So this is a direct thing. It's not even me anymore. It's not even us. It's you.
[00:16:57] And then what happens after that? What happens after that is now you, now you have to have a
[00:17:04] stick, right? Outcomes us because we, we were, we had to care it out for a while.
[00:17:09] And some of those bargaining can be carats. Hey, Dave, you know, if you can hold off on that
[00:17:13] merit marketer, I'll give you this other marketer over here. That's a carrot. I use that carrot.
[00:17:17] I didn't mention it, but yeah, that's another indirect way. If I can draw you away from this
[00:17:20] bad area to this other area with a carrot, that's positive. We just got a bunch of intel that this
[00:17:27] other market areas really start and ramp up. Why don't you put something there? All of a sudden,
[00:17:32] you go, oh, yeah, okay, I didn't know that cool. You jump on that carrot. Well, now, when you don't,
[00:17:36] when you go through this escalation, now I add some point I have to get out of stick.
[00:17:39] And say, if you try and open up something in that market area, I'm actually going to remove you
[00:17:47] from that position, or I'm going to dock your pay or whatever the punishment becomes. I'll write
[00:17:52] you up, whatever it's going to become. And that's sort of where we get to, you know, theoretically
[00:18:00] in the business world of the highest level of escalation is like, I'm going to fire you, right?
[00:18:05] If you don't do what I'm telling you to do, you are going to get fired. I'm going to fire you.
[00:18:10] And of course, you go outside the business world, you go into the streets as they say. Well,
[00:18:15] there's the threat of violence comes next, which is, hey, you either get, you either move your
[00:18:20] car out of my parking space, or I'm going to punch you in the head. That's a threat of violence.
[00:18:26] And what happens after that? Violence. I grab you. I put you back in your car, and I, you know,
[00:18:32] don't say you better back out of this thing right now. And, and if you really want to take this
[00:18:40] to the next level, the ultimate is the, the existential threat, which is if you don't do what I'm
[00:18:48] telling you to do, I'm going to kill you. Right? So, so, and it's important to, it's important to
[00:18:53] understand what that that's there. And I'll tell you why, because a lot of people, they want to
[00:18:59] start. They want to start this, this continuum at the threat. That's where they begin. That's where
[00:19:07] they begin with their employees. They start with, this is what you're going to do. That's where they
[00:19:13] start. And once, once you, once you cross, here's the thing. So, once you cross that threshold
[00:19:21] of director overt, that's another good word, overt leadership. Meaning, I'm telling you exactly,
[00:19:26] this is totally overt. There's no, there's no influence happening there. It's just me telling
[00:19:30] you what's going to happen. And when we do that, when we, when you start out there, you just don't
[00:19:37] have anywhere to go. You don't have anywhere else to go. So, the lower you are on the continuum,
[00:19:48] the better off you are as a leader. And in fact, in fact, if you go negative, if I go,
[00:19:54] if I'm your boss, Dave, and I go negative, and I actually let you influence me. And I say,
[00:19:59] you know what, Dave, that looks like a great marketer. I had any think of going in there. Let's do it.
[00:20:04] I'm gaining more, even more leadership capital. So, it's even better if I'm in the negative,
[00:20:10] if I'm in that other chart where you're actually influencing me. So, if we can do that,
[00:20:18] then we don't ever have to get to that threshold. And I, like I said, I, the amount of times
[00:20:26] I've crossed that threshold in my life from a leadership perspective is freaking tiny. And I'll
[00:20:33] tell you where let's just start one place that happens all the time. It happens with kids all the time.
[00:20:38] Right? Of kids all the time, it's, it's, it's clean your room. Why? Because I said so, there you go.
[00:20:46] Yep, you just went right to the, hey, direct over, I'm going to order you what to do,
[00:20:52] horrible thing to do. What happens with employees? Happens up and down the chain to command.
[00:20:59] And here's what's interesting. When you are, when you cross the threshold of,
[00:21:07] of direct and you cross the threshold of overt, you, there's a, there's a equal and opposite reaction.
[00:21:18] Right? So, every time you bark at someone, they, they might do what you said, but there is
[00:21:23] an equal and opposite reaction that they are looking for you to fail. They're looking to sabotage
[00:21:29] or looking to cause problems. The stronger the order is the more you yell at somebody, the stronger
[00:21:33] that backlash is going to be. That's the reality of the situation. And a lot of people, a lot of
[00:21:41] people need to think about this. So, in the same way that the Marine Corps put together this manual
[00:21:48] to let everybody know that there's, that they're competing all the time. You should also know that
[00:21:55] there's a continuum that, you're on a continuum of competition all the time. And there's also a
[00:22:00] continuum of leadership. And by the way, it's up and down the chain of command too. And I'm not
[00:22:04] going to like dig deep into this right now. We'll do it later. But when you talk about up the chain of
[00:22:09] command, there's a continuum as well. It starts off with just compliance. Dave tells me to do something
[00:22:15] he's my boss. Cool. I do it. What's the next level? I question what he's saying. Hey, Dave, why are we doing
[00:22:21] that? What's the next level? Hey, Dave, I don't think we should do that. We get some resistance going.
[00:22:25] Then we get to objection. This is a bad idea. And then we eventually get to refusal. And then we get to
[00:22:31] mute and so there's a continuum there as well. And there's some people that start off, you know,
[00:22:36] if they don't have a, if they're not thinking strategically, they go right to this, this is still making
[00:22:40] sense. That's where they go right to. They're jumping right there. And now all of a sudden, what are
[00:22:44] they going to get back? An equal and opposite reaction, which says, shut up and do what I told you to do.
[00:22:47] So we don't want to go to war. We want to build relationships. We want to build relationships with
[00:22:58] other country. We're other nation states. We want to have a relation. We don't want to go to war.
[00:23:02] War costs us money and lives. We don't want that. We don't want to go to war with our employees.
[00:23:09] We don't want to go to war with our teammates. If you recognize this continuum, you can start to say,
[00:23:16] oh, I see what's going on. I'm escalating. How much am I going to escalate? What's the next
[00:23:21] lowest minimum step I could take in my escalation? So that's what we need to do. We need to pay attention
[00:23:28] of that. I don't have to do this. I can barely think of times when I've had to do this.
[00:23:38] And why is because I listen up one other people have to say, I dig in. I mean, I don't dig into
[00:23:43] my position. I don't think my position is infinitely better than yours. I think probably if you
[00:23:48] and I both want to kill bad guys and win the war, our ideas are going to be pretty close. I think
[00:23:53] if we both want to take care of our clients and make profit, our ideas are going to be pretty close.
[00:24:00] They're going to be pretty close. Close enough that I can be fairly agreeable with whatever it is
[00:24:05] someone else wants to do. But it's a continuum that we have to pay attention to just like
[00:24:13] competing. What do you got Dave? You're over there taking notes. I was just thinking,
[00:24:22] I mean, I'm listening to what you're saying and I'm making the connection and you're using
[00:24:26] examples that I actually get to live. I lived in the military, but I get to live that now too,
[00:24:32] because I've released the clients we work with. I've released ships inside of the Shlon
[00:24:34] front. I've released ships at different ways, even with you and there are times that you and
[00:24:40] are working together. There are times that you're helping me, almost in a support role with
[00:24:44] the client and there's times that you're the CEO of the company. I'm running one of the departments.
[00:24:49] As you're talking about that, I'm picturing this continuum. Where's the threat of violence?
[00:24:53] Where does physical violence or where does war come in? The more you make deposits or the more
[00:24:59] you take the indirect approach, the more you get to keep doing that and the more you go to the
[00:25:06] direct threat, the more you have to use that. And just the idea of the recognition is that
[00:25:14] and I'm just thinking of those terms of the more indirect you are. The more leadership deposits I make,
[00:25:18] the more that's the technique I get to use, because the more I let you influence me, the more
[00:25:24] likely you're going to be doing the things you want to do that help us get to the end state. And I never
[00:25:27] have to, I never have to move down that, that almost never have to move down that continuum. I'm
[00:25:32] trying to think of a time where I'm trying to think of a time where you had to escalate in a way that
[00:25:38] I recognized. And I've been working for years. Now, I'm not saying that that hasn't happened.
[00:25:45] I'm not saying that the escalation hasn't occurred, but it's, I can't think of a time where I went,
[00:25:49] oh, damn, I kind of, I kind of pushed him up the stair step. So it has been subtle enough. The
[00:25:56] times, however many times has happened, but the reason it works, even those subtle escalations,
[00:26:01] the reason they work is because that's the technique you always use. So the idea of the threat of
[00:26:07] violence, especially if that's your first move, it's so limiting. It gives you so few options after
[00:26:12] that, that it's such a bad, it's not a bad first move. It's even a bad six or seventh one. I think
[00:26:18] there's this idea that there are so many things. And I think the part that has leaders that I want to
[00:26:24] avoid war as well, even if I'm the boss, even if I'm in charge, it's not what I want. And I think
[00:26:29] the way you close it was, is this because the equal and opposite reaction. And this satisfaction of
[00:26:33] knowing you're going to win is not should not be enough to make, and as a parent makes the most sense.
[00:26:38] I know I'm going to win that worth my get. If I tell my kid to clean his room, because I said so,
[00:26:42] he is going to clean his room. What a great victory. What a win. Yeah. And, and yeah,
[00:26:48] for how long until the reaction from him becomes so big and so violent that I lose all influence
[00:26:54] over him. Yeah, the other thing is, as I brush up against, hey, well, maybe it's the time.
[00:27:03] Maybe it's the time to go direct in this situation. Most of the time, after way that against,
[00:27:08] okay, well, what does that get me strategically? Right? Where does that get me strategically? If I've
[00:27:13] got to say, you know what Dave, you need to do it this way from now on. I want you to use this
[00:27:19] font on the power points, right? Whatever thing you want to come up with. Where does that get me strategically?
[00:27:27] All you have to do is take one step back and say, wait a second, where does that get me strategically?
[00:27:30] Does that improve my relationship with Dave? Does this make him want to do a better job? Does this,
[00:27:34] like you just have to take one step back and you, oh, yeah, this is dumb. This is a dumb move.
[00:27:39] What I should do is be a better influencer, have a better relationship, explain myself better,
[00:27:45] do some bargaining, talk about it, maybe I'm wrong, maybe the font that he's using is actually
[00:27:50] better for these and and by the way, has he picked a font that's eligible? Right? Has he picked a
[00:27:58] font that's eligible? Is it, is it, Cyrillic? Is that the right word? I don't know. Cyrillic, is that
[00:28:05] the right word? Like the Russian? Yeah, is he picked a font that is illegible in English? Right?
[00:28:11] And then then I kind of have to make a stand, but if it's legible, if people can read it,
[00:28:17] why am I freaking out? The answer is I'm stupid. I want to waste my leadership capital
[00:28:21] on something that doesn't matter. But by the way, up and down the chain of command, because if I
[00:28:26] said, hey, Dave, what do you think of that font? You know what you'd say to me? You're like,
[00:28:30] well, I've been using it, but what does it not look good? And I'd say, well, I don't know,
[00:28:34] it's a little bit unclear from a distance. You'd say, oh, I'm going to fall on my sword about
[00:28:38] this font. No, you'd actually say, oh, which one have you been using? And I'd say, oh, I've been using
[00:28:43] aerial because it has sharp edges, which I like. And you'd say, hmm, oh, click down, drop, drop the
[00:28:51] menu, there's aerial, you click on it. Yeah, you're right. That does look pretty good, Joco.
[00:28:56] And I go, gee, thank you. And you say, you know what, I'm going to change all my briefs to aerial.
[00:29:01] Because just vice versa, I'm not sitting here telling you, use Cyrillic fonts that can't be read,
[00:29:08] by English speaking humans. So you're, so what do we do? I'm offering a little suggestion,
[00:29:17] and you're going, oh, yeah, that's a great suggestion. My leadership capital went up,
[00:29:22] your leadership capital went up. It's a beautiful thing. Or we can have World War VII about a font.
[00:29:29] It's such a tactical loss for you to say, it's, first of all, to tackle a loss from you to say,
[00:29:37] you need to change this font. This, you need to use aerial because that's what I use.
[00:29:41] Yeah, okay. Great. Oh, hey, by the way, it's different. That font's different on other systems.
[00:29:48] And now all of it looks like just a horrible thing. If you're smart, you go, hey, oh, you like
[00:29:53] air, cool. Got it. We're moving forward. Be surprised. Be surprised. All right,
[00:30:02] it's interesting, isn't it? It's interesting, how you kind of use the pan fidgeting example
[00:30:10] on Dave over here, but you literally did me like that. Did I really? Yeah, we have it. Remember,
[00:30:16] I was clicking the pan. Yeah, there's on online. Oh, you need to post it there. And you,
[00:30:22] I did post it. I know what I said. I said, do you think the Mike picks up that noise? Yeah,
[00:30:28] do you think the Mike's? And you know what you said? You said no. I don't think so. But you didn't
[00:30:33] begin. No. But then you kind of clicked it a couple times while we were just quiet. And you know what you heard?
[00:30:39] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, and then I laughed. Yeah. And I did, it was weird.
[00:30:45] It kind of was, it was almost like in not slow motion, but kind of like I could slowly,
[00:30:50] within the span of our would say maybe six seconds, I slowly picked up on what you're doing there.
[00:30:56] Like why you said it like that? Like you're saying, hey, stop doing the clicking. Just stop clicking.
[00:31:00] You, that's what you're saying. And but you said it in this way. Hey, do you think that that's
[00:31:06] going to have end the way the tone, everything like you could tell you knew what you're doing with
[00:31:09] the way you delivered that question. Here's the, here's the no kidding. The, the no kidding. When I
[00:31:16] asked you that question, I was earnestly asking that question. Like, do you think that's going to show
[00:31:20] up? Now, it's an earnest question. Do you think that clicking is going to show up on this podcast?
[00:31:27] It's an earnest question. I probably had a pretty good suspicion because I can freaking hear it through
[00:31:31] my headphones for 15 minutes. But you got to detach from those emotions. And you got to ask
[00:31:37] an earnest question because maybe if it's not going to show up, why am I worried about it?
[00:31:40] I'm not going to let it, I'm not going to let it bother me. If it's not going to show up,
[00:31:44] it's not going to be on the audio, then who cares? I'm not going to care about that. If you want to
[00:31:48] click your panel all day, cool. It's not bothering me. It's not going to be on the, we're good.
[00:31:52] So it's an earnest question. But I mean, it's, it's, we did know the answer. Yeah. Kind of,
[00:31:58] because we can hear it. You know, it's kind of interesting. We'll say, because you know, I did
[00:32:03] kind of say, no, I don't think so. I forget exactly what I said. We'll get the replay. Yeah. But I
[00:32:08] feel like if I remember correctly, I was kind of, at least at the very least, implied that, like,
[00:32:12] no, no, no, it's all good. Almost. For just for a split second, though, your thing is that was a
[00:32:17] version of me, like defensively. I was about to say that was that was an instinctual defense.
[00:32:24] It's instinctual. Exactly. Like that instinctual defense. Yeah. Yeah. And then, but I was so,
[00:32:29] it was so not, like, just natural. Yeah. But it was so not called for, like, on a, like, a primal
[00:32:36] level. If you were, like, it was so not called for that. I felt that it was so not called for,
[00:32:40] and I don't, I don't have to dig in on this. Clicking the pan. Let's face it. Like, I know that it's,
[00:32:46] like, a habit. You know, I mean, clicking bends to have it. And then what made it additionally
[00:32:51] interesting, just a little teeny tiny interaction was that, I was like, oh, man, I do it, like,
[00:32:55] I got a habit, right? There's the excuses, like, trying to explain, like, I do how to have it.
[00:32:59] And then, instead of you saying, mirror those two excuses or whatever, you were just like,
[00:33:03] oh, and then you grabbed, like, the nearest non-clicking pan and just simply gave me some
[00:33:08] bargaining. Red option. That's, that's the carrot, right? The carrot, like, oh, maybe
[00:33:15] do you get your attention from that? Yeah, there you go. Perfect. You know, the, the things that fall into
[00:33:22] the category of indirect and direct, like the techniques you can use can actually, I was thinking
[00:33:27] about that conversation can actually change. If early in a relationship or relationship that doesn't
[00:33:32] have a lot of mutual respect or you don't have any of that leadership capital built,
[00:33:36] you can say, hey, Dave, don't, don't click your pan. And I'd be like, okay, I probably comply,
[00:33:42] but am I mine? I like, dude, what's the deal? And I, I might have that natural, that little reaction,
[00:33:47] that little ego hit, and then that little resistance, or even maybe little resentment,
[00:33:51] whatever it is. And this is a small example, but it would fit in the category of direct.
[00:33:55] I don't naturally like that. But over time, if you've actually done the things you're just talking
[00:34:01] about, and you've built enough capital, what falls as indirect or influence, that actually can
[00:34:07] expand. You can say to me, right now, hey, don't click that pan. And I'm going to have no
[00:34:11] reaction to it. Because I'm going to think, oh, he's only telling me that for my own benefit,
[00:34:14] for the benefit of the body. I'm not going to have that reaction, so that what appears to be a
[00:34:19] direct that you're saying something directly to me, I don't even register that as a direct,
[00:34:23] and that actually fits in the category of, at a minimum, there's no withdrawal there. So even
[00:34:28] the things that you do as little as they are, the options for indirect leadership actually
[00:34:33] can grow. Things that would normally be outside there, where I would have some sort of problem
[00:34:37] with you saying that, where I think, a mustard three, and you go, hey, when you're doing Q&A,
[00:34:45] you say, I think you said something like, you say, in between, don't do that anymore.
[00:34:50] And the way you said it didn't bother me at all. But it could be that if you have that conversation
[00:34:58] with somebody, and you don't have any leadership capital, they might not like that. So you
[00:35:02] being able to say that to me is a function of the trust that we have, the influence that we shared,
[00:35:07] and the amount of leadership capital, you have that you can actually kind of be direct,
[00:35:11] and it doesn't bother me that it would, in a way that it would, had just come at, you know,
[00:35:15] day one, we're like, I don't like the way you talk, do it differently. And I'm not going to like that,
[00:35:19] no matter who I am. So even what you can do, what you can get away with in a sense of what is still
[00:35:24] a leadership capital deposit, that will grow as well. Yeah, that's, that's why it's all
[00:35:31] interlaced with leadership capital. Because if you start off day one by saying, I don't like the
[00:35:37] way you talk, that's, you use went into a deficit immediately. And now you got to dig your way out of that.
[00:35:43] That's why it's totally interlaced with leadership capital. Because the more leadership capital you have,
[00:35:48] the more when you need to now, if I said, hey, Dave, you're saying, oh, when you talk and hey,
[00:35:53] Dave, this answer was bad and hey, Dave, the way you presented this, your slides were all,
[00:35:58] they didn't look good and hate. And I just started everything was negative. Well, I'm going to
[00:36:02] eventually going to run out of leadership capital and start going in a bad way. And you're, you're out of
[00:36:06] two, just, all chocolate does is just tell me what I do wrong. And I guess I can't do anything right.
[00:36:12] And I guess I just don't even need to be here. And I think you go look for another job. It's just,
[00:36:16] you know, because I've, I've expended all my leadership capital. So it's completely intertwined with
[00:36:20] leadership capital, completely intertwined with leadership capital. But just like, you know, I said this on
[00:36:27] EF online the other day, I people usually think they have more leadership capital than they do.
[00:36:32] They usually think they're just rolling deep in in in leadership capital in their own little heads.
[00:36:39] They think, of course. So I always kind of treat every situation as if, okay, you know, I'm,
[00:36:49] I'm lean. I'm running lean. It's going to be lean Christmas. That's my parents used to tell me.
[00:36:53] It's going to be lean Christmas. So I always think, I don't have leadership capital to spare because
[00:36:59] also what if I really need leadership capital tomorrow? What if tomorrow? I go, hey, Dave,
[00:37:06] I know it's your, your anniversary, your tenure anniversary, your 20 year anniversary, whatever. And I know
[00:37:12] that you're supposed to go to the mountains with your life for three days. And we just had a
[00:37:16] client call and you now have to go to Oklahoma to talk to them. And I might have to do that.
[00:37:23] Tomorrow. And that's the way it is. So am I really, how much, how, where do I want that account?
[00:37:29] Right. I want that account to be as built up as I possibly can. So that means I'm not going to waste
[00:37:33] leadership capital on little things that don't matter. Not going to happen. Yeah. That's why the default
[00:37:38] no matter where you are should almost always be almost always be on that side of the default should be on
[00:37:42] that side of this spectrum. Yeah. And it's weird too because you have the, you have the threshold of violence,
[00:37:47] we have the, on the continuum, on the war continuum, on the competing continuum, there's a
[00:37:55] threshold of violence. There's actual real violence with with influencing people. Like you have to
[00:38:00] admit that that you can push people around and you can smack them and you can beat them up. That's
[00:38:04] a, there's a, there's a threshold of violence on the, on the influence on the influence continuum.
[00:38:11] Before that, there's, there's a one between direct and indirect. So you cross that one, which is
[00:38:16] a huge one. That's like the big one. Yeah. Now, of course, I guess the threshold of violence is a
[00:38:21] big one too on influence because now you're getting charged with a salt or murder or murder, depending on
[00:38:28] what level of violence you took a deal of. So it's important to think about these things.
[00:38:36] And with that, we're going to jump into this, this, this whole thing, man. I mean, I just like,
[00:38:41] I've just been thinking about this nonstop, which is pretty normal for me to think about these
[00:38:46] things, nonstop. So competing for US Marine Corps brand new manual one tack for it's called
[00:38:55] competing last last time we covered chapter one this time we're covering chapter two. This one's
[00:39:00] chapter two is called the theory of competition. And it says competition as an active policy
[00:39:07] as states engage in competition or try to shape the competitions on going among the range of
[00:39:12] state and nonstate actors involved in areas of interest to states they develop policies frame
[00:39:19] to frame order and apply resources to this activity. Marines need to understand policy,
[00:39:25] how it's developed and how it relates to ongoing competition. My little note here just says,
[00:39:32] what are you doing? This is me making notes to myself, what are you doing? What are you doing? Where are
[00:39:39] you at? Do you know what your what competition are you in? You know, I had a it was an early
[00:39:46] part, it was a pretty early podcast, I don't know which one, but when I started talking about
[00:39:50] what game are you playing and and you can be playing the wrong game with your life and if you're
[00:39:57] looking up and you're like, man, I'm doing everything I can but I just I'm not putting any points on the
[00:40:03] board. Well, if you're playing soccer, you might not be putting any points on the board because there's
[00:40:08] only one goal a game or three, maybe you should be playing basketball, we can score 48 points again.
[00:40:17] So with this competition, what are you competing in? And who are you competing against?
[00:40:23] Goes on, Marines are frequently asked to provide input to policymakers as they deliberate.
[00:40:29] Understanding the larger context around policy decisions helps Marines determine the broader
[00:40:35] intent behind specific decisions which in turn helps us make sound supporting plants. What does
[00:40:43] that mean? Everyone should know why they're doing what they're doing. Like war, Marines should
[00:40:48] think of competition as serving policy. Since we acknowledge competition as an enduring condition,
[00:40:56] that's a great, that's a great phrase, one would adopt that one, enduring condition. It's just
[00:41:01] ongoing. It's forever. In internal relations, then we need to take equally and equally long
[00:41:07] view when it comes to policy as well. US vital interests have remained relatively stable over time.
[00:41:12] For example, since World War II, they've been framed in various ways while consistently calling
[00:41:16] for the maintenance of our constitutional values, protection of the American homeland and people,
[00:41:21] promotion of American prosperity and the advancement of the American influence in the world.
[00:41:25] The contemporary environment will affect these specifics of policy, but the enduring
[00:41:32] foundation for it consists of stable interests such as these. So what, what the reason I
[00:41:38] and again, sometimes I look like, oh, we can kind of breathe over this part. No, I know you can't.
[00:41:43] Because if you, if you think about your life, okay, you can think about your business for sure.
[00:41:48] What is it that your business is trying to do? Like do you think a Marine wakes up in the morning and says,
[00:41:53] okay, today I'm going to maintain our, the maintain our constitutional values.
[00:41:57] Is he saying, all right, I've got to protect the American homeland. People, we kind of, we kind of
[00:42:01] know that one promotion of American prosperity. So there's these, there's these things. They're
[00:42:05] so big, such big strategic goals that they shape every decision that you make. They should
[00:42:13] the advancement of American influence around the world. If a Marine goes out and does something
[00:42:17] stupid in name a foreign country goes out and acts like gun to get strong and act like an idiot,
[00:42:25] has he helped the advancement of American influence in the world? No, he hasn't.
[00:42:29] And that's what he's going to hear from his commanding officer. You just made all Marines
[00:42:34] to look bad and you just made America look bad by getting drunk and getting a fighter,
[00:42:38] whatever you did that will stupid. And that Marine can't deny that. He says, Roger Sir,
[00:42:45] it was a bad move. If that Marine would have been thinking a little bit more strategic,
[00:42:51] maybe he would have maintained a little bit more level ahead on the bears. You know, I had a Marine
[00:42:56] one time. I was on a ship. I was on a ship and look, we know we know that I love the Marine
[00:43:03] corps. I was on a ship. And when you'd pull and to port, you have to get in line to get off the
[00:43:09] ship. And sometimes it take an hour or two hours. So what we would do is we'd work out,
[00:43:13] as soon as we got, as soon as we hit the pier, we would work out. This is like 1990, whatever.
[00:43:19] We'd hit the pier, work out. And by the time we got done working out, took a shower,
[00:43:24] then you could just walk right off the ship because all the Marines were already gone. So once
[00:43:27] time I did that, like me and my buddies, we got, we hit the pier, we start working out,
[00:43:30] we get done working out, take a shower. It's been an hour and a half. We come walking up to leave.
[00:43:35] So these guys have been off the ship without that. They are carrying a young Marine back on the ship,
[00:43:40] just completely brain dead from alcohol. So, you gotta be careful out there.
[00:43:50] But so, so when you look at, if you look at the Marine corps has these kind of broad things that
[00:43:54] they're saying, this is what we're doing. What do you have in your life? What do you have in your business?
[00:44:00] What do you have in your business? Okay, just like that young Marine, if he's lead well,
[00:44:04] he's going to say, you know what? The home Marine Corps is relying on me to make America look
[00:44:10] good. God, that's sort of good Marine is going to say. If you're running a business and you've got
[00:44:18] a cashier, I've been using cashiers a lot because you know why? Because they're front line and
[00:44:23] they're interacting with people. If you've got a cashier that treats a customer bad, he's making
[00:44:28] the whole company look bad. If you doesn't know that, okay, and then what about your life?
[00:44:31] What are you trying to do in your life? What are you trying to, where are you trying to go with your
[00:44:36] life? What's the broad, what's the broad strategic mark that you're trying to make? Do you have one?
[00:44:45] Do you have one? And if you don't have one, how are you making decisions? You're making decisions
[00:44:52] for with no, with no steering whatsoever, without a compass. So these are enduring interests.
[00:45:04] And during interest provide Marines a potential source of competitive advantage.
[00:45:12] At hearing to our values, when done as part of a comprehensive strategy,
[00:45:16] you can serve to attract others and work in harmony with Marines with what Marines learned from
[00:45:22] an early age. Value such as freedom of expression and press freedom can help frustrate the plans
[00:45:29] of some competitors. Positive some interests such as increasing American prosperity also help
[00:45:35] attract allies and partners. This is especially true when we can show how our interests align
[00:45:42] with theirs. And that interesting. If we can work together, we're going to be better off. We're
[00:45:50] stronger together. We're stronger together than we are fighting each other.
[00:45:52] Domestic politics affects the policy decisions of almost all competitors and the resulting
[00:46:03] character of all nearly all competitions. Everything you do, everything you do impacts,
[00:46:13] the competitors and the competition itself. As mentioned in chapter one,
[00:46:19] there are often multiple centers of power in each nation and the struggle amongst them often
[00:46:23] creates ambiguity in the minds of outside observers. These struggles affect internal politics and
[00:46:28] often drive or limit current policy choices. This is true in the United States. For example,
[00:46:33] when we see the deliberations on national policy among three co-equal branches of the government,
[00:46:38] in other less open societies, domestic considerations have major impact on policy,
[00:46:43] even though these considerations are often harder for outsiders to understand.
[00:46:48] This happens in businesses a lot. You've got some people with different ideas of how we're
[00:46:52] going to get where we're going, sometimes unfortunately, even disagree on where they're going,
[00:46:56] which is bad. And that's something with all the political mayhem that we're facing in America right now.
[00:47:03] I guess maybe mayhem's well, with what we're facing right now, we'll just call it. We want
[00:47:09] put a, we don't want to sign a word to it because different people will sign at different words.
[00:47:16] We'll say that there's disagreements in America right? But this is what, this is a democracy
[00:47:28] is going to be messy, but you're going to get a better result in the end. So if you, if you
[00:47:36] have a platoon where, hey, I'm going to take input from the troops, so they're going to let me know
[00:47:41] and sometimes they're going to argue with me about some stuff and not argue, but we're going to
[00:47:44] disagree about some things. Now, if it turns into an argument, we start fighting, that's bad.
[00:47:48] But for, for my point, man, to say, hey, Joc, I don't think that's a good route to get into the
[00:47:53] target. And me to say, well, why not? And for us to have a discussion about that's totally
[00:47:56] positive thing. I want to come to a better conclusion. That's what's supposed to happen in democracy.
[00:48:00] We have a discussion, but we're both trying to get to the target. My point, man, once to get there,
[00:48:05] I want to get there. In America, we've got, what are we trying to do? We've got a hope that we are
[00:48:12] aligned enough that we say, oh, we want our economy to get better. Okay, can anyone, is anyone disagree
[00:48:20] with that? All right, maybe we disagree on how we get there, but at least we have this one thing
[00:48:25] that we know we're moving towards. And you can say that, about what do we want? There to be
[00:48:31] poverty in the country. Does anyone that says, yeah, well, I really think we need in America's
[00:48:35] more poverty? No, no one's saying that. There's not one person that's saying we need more poverty
[00:48:39] in America. So no matter who you are, you're saying, yep, you know what, we don't want poverty.
[00:48:45] We want less poverty. Great. Now, you might think we get there one way. Someone else thinks you
[00:48:49] get there. Another way. Okay, let's figure out what those things are. And then we can discuss
[00:48:53] how we get there. But it's okay if we disagree, because we're just trying to find the best solution.
[00:48:58] And when Dave's solution is different to me than me than how we get to the target, and he's the
[00:49:03] point, man. And I say, shut up, we're going my way. And he goes, no, we're not that stupid. And now,
[00:49:08] we're in a fist fight. Our platoon is falling apart. So what we do is we listen to each other.
[00:49:13] And we look for the best possible solution. And maybe, you know, as you, I always try and just agree
[00:49:19] with the other person. What does that mean? Does that mean I just always bow down and say, oh,
[00:49:24] you know what, Dave, you know, I can't make a new decision. So we're going with the Dave says, no,
[00:49:29] because Dave wants to go one way that I think is going to take an extra 15 minutes.
[00:49:33] The route that Dave chooses as the point man is going to take an extra 15 minutes. So you know what,
[00:49:40] we're not doing it that way. We have a seven hour patrol. My way is going to take seven hours.
[00:49:45] Dave's way is going to take seven hours and 15 minutes. We're doing my way. No, actually, Dave,
[00:49:52] you know what, your way sounds great. Why? Because I already said, I just, I just in that moment,
[00:49:56] I saved 30 minutes of you and I arguing about it. And now we can focus on something more important.
[00:50:02] And by the way, we're still getting to the target. And by the way, there's so many unknowns on that route
[00:50:07] that I don't know and you don't know. And no one can know. And so I'm actually arguing about something
[00:50:11] that I have no idea where the landmines, where is the, what is the actual terrain like, what,
[00:50:16] how tall is that little cliff that I see? Is that something we can get up or do you need to
[00:50:20] bring ropes? And also, it takes 45 minutes just to get up that little thing. We got to carry extra gear.
[00:50:24] I don't know any of that. So guess what? Am I going to argue with you for 15 minutes of
[00:50:29] difference? No. Sounds good, Dave. So why don't I have to, why can I let Dave do whatever,
[00:50:35] why can I almost always say I'm going to go with someone else's plan? Because I work with Dave
[00:50:40] for long enough. And by the way, I actually taught Dave land navigation. So when Dave comes to me,
[00:50:47] and he says, hey, here's how I think we should go. There's a 98% chance that it's pretty freaking
[00:50:51] close to what I would do in the first place. And by the way, either way, we still get to the target,
[00:50:55] which is where we're going. Back to the book. For United States Marines,
[00:51:06] understanding current policy relies in part on understanding the interplay between domestic
[00:51:12] politics and our enduring vital national interests. Shouldn't everyone just kind of have
[00:51:17] enduring vital interests for their family, for their business, for their life? Shouldn't we all
[00:51:22] have those things? Yes, we should. As a nation, yes, we should. As specs of domestic politics,
[00:51:29] like the election cycle and contemporary societal issues affect current policy, these aspects are typically
[00:51:36] felt by Marines through such things, resourcing decisions, guidance on the composition of the
[00:51:40] force and specific direction to focus, particular national interests or particular competitors.
[00:51:47] You should know the story about what's going on. That whole thing right there, hey,
[00:51:53] Corporal Smith that just heard me read that that said, hey, bro, I'm not I'm not I'm not tracking.
[00:52:00] What this means is you need to know it's just just understand what's happening in the world.
[00:52:06] And understanding that what's happening in the world is going to sort of guide what the Marine
[00:52:09] Corps is doing. International competition, particularly among nations, plays out over a long timeline.
[00:52:18] Oh, what timeline is that? Life. Pursuing the goals put forth by the Constitution and its
[00:52:24] amendments has been an enduring vital interest to the United States since the day became effective in
[00:52:29] 1789. This contrast with our desire to bring war to a conclusion as quickly as possible.
[00:52:36] Marines need to understand this distinction. Competitive advantage.
[00:52:47] Advantage is relative to a competitor when one actor is able to do something better than its
[00:52:52] rival or rivals. Check, we get that. What's a corporal terminal lance? That's sort of,
[00:53:01] that's, we should be using terminal lance. That guy's legit. Terminal lance is a
[00:53:07] he's a cartoon. And he's always actually a whole book too. Terminal lance props.
[00:53:15] A business enjoys, it's interesting. Here we go back to a business. A business enjoys competitive
[00:53:18] advantage when it can sell a product at a lower price than other businesses, assuming other factors
[00:53:22] like quality stay the same. Nations also have relative competitive advantages, also referred to
[00:53:27] as comparative advantages. Historically, the innovative culture in the United States helped
[00:53:32] bring it new goods and services to the international marketplace faster than others. The cost
[00:53:37] of labor in some countries is lower than others, which makes them more attractive for labor intensive
[00:53:42] manufacturing businesses. It follows then that we must understand our potential rivals if we are
[00:53:47] to develop and maintain a competitive advantage against them. G. We must understand our potential
[00:53:55] rivals, Sunsu, Art of War, know who you're fighting. The United States has many competitive
[00:54:00] advantage. Oh, by the way, obviously this is something that we're doing all the time at
[00:54:05] origin. Right? Well, there's we're competing against nations that make the same
[00:54:12] basic product that we make, but they're doing it with slave labor or they're doing it with
[00:54:18] someone that's getting paid in horrible working conditions. And so we've had to find ways and we
[00:54:23] continue to find ways that we can compete with them. And not only are we competitive, we're better
[00:54:28] because our product ends up better. And because we're here now now you get into shipping and what
[00:54:35] is it costs to ship things from overseas? What does that do to the whole picture? So we're
[00:54:43] we're figuring out and we have figured out how we have a competitive advantage, even though we
[00:54:49] take care of our workers, which we actually also feel is a competitive advantage. Taking care
[00:54:53] of your people is a competitive advantage. Because now your people care about the product that they're
[00:54:59] making. They want to do a good job. Not not slaving in a in a sweatshop. Instead of looking
[00:55:09] instead of looking at slave labor as an advantage, I look at as a disadvantage. We've got the
[00:55:17] advantage because we have a better workforce who care about the company. The United States has many
[00:55:25] competitive advantages in international competition. The world's largest economy and an international
[00:55:30] financial system that uses the dollar to make transactions are strong economic advantages. Yes,
[00:55:35] the enduring US interests in freedom of navigation on the seas attracts many partners because
[00:55:40] free navigation reduces the overall cost of trading between nations. The US higher education system
[00:55:45] attracts students from all over the world. The list goes on and on. But these illustrations show
[00:55:50] that we should look for a nation's competitive advantages among its enduring qualities, such as
[00:55:54] values, interest and culture. And this is what you need to do. So how does this tie into everybody?
[00:56:00] What about your business? How do you have the culture and do you have the values inside your
[00:56:09] business that are actually competitive advantages? Do you have that? If you don't have that,
[00:56:16] if you don't have values, if you don't have a culture, that's a competitive advantage. You're wrong.
[00:56:25] The competitive advantages in the military component of dime are naturally of great interests
[00:56:33] to Marines. Since World War II, the United States made the use of several military advantages
[00:56:40] such as the joint forces of ability to project and sustain power globally. It's skillet operating
[00:56:46] across domains and its expertise in precision targeting and strike. The US military's
[00:56:52] principal professionalism can also present distinctive advantages. For example, when it's
[00:56:58] properly contrasted with competitors seeking to extend a fairitarian government without regard
[00:57:02] for rule of law or protection of civilians. So that's a huge advantage that we have is that we have
[00:57:07] military professionals. And that's what they do. And it's also advantage as far as on concern that
[00:57:12] we have reserveists that come and serve in Iraq, come and serve in an Afghanist and that go
[00:57:18] for the weekend and see how the military is doing and take their civilian expertise into the
[00:57:24] into the reserve unit or the national guard unit for the weekend. We have both those.
[00:57:29] And there's advantages to both of those.
[00:57:35] Talking about that, I think it was the Guadalcanal reason podcast.
[00:57:40] We're talking about how some of the reserveists, where the people that said, hey, that's a
[00:57:44] dumb idea. We don't want to do that. Because they hadn't been indoctrinated as fully as
[00:57:51] somebody that had been an infantry officer for 18 years and he's looking at the problem going,
[00:57:56] hey, I know how to solve this problem in the book. I know what to do. And some reserveists are like,
[00:58:00] hey, bro, I hunt and ten a sea. And that doesn't make any sense. So we use this as a competitive advantage.
[00:58:11] I'm just thinking this whole time about the connection between these military examples.
[00:58:16] And I'm going through my head things that I remember as a Marine. And how closely
[00:58:19] connected they are to just everybody's life in both business and in life just the connections to
[00:58:26] your family has you have long-range plans for your family. You have these strategic, long-range plans
[00:58:32] for your family. It's a really no different than I think they called the the enduring values of the
[00:58:37] country that you need to keep in mind that might actually change or influence the smaller things that you do.
[00:58:45] Yeah, and that's something I've been hitting on a lot. The fact that culture is the ultimate form
[00:58:51] of decentralized command. Culture is the ultimate form of decentralized command. Where now we have a
[00:58:57] a cashier that knows how to treat a client, a knows how to treat a customer because understands
[00:59:01] the culture of the company. Now we have a Marine that can be out in town can see a situation unfolding
[00:59:06] and knows what decision to make it just based on the culture of the Marine Corps, of the seal teams,
[00:59:11] of the army, of the 80 second airborne of the 101st airborne of the base. If you have that culture
[00:59:17] correct, that soldier, that Marine, that cashier, that frontline salesperson, they know what
[00:59:24] decision to make just based on the culture that you have inside the organization totally.
[00:59:28] And that's a two-way street too because if I'm running a grocery store and I've got a cashier,
[00:59:33] I'm not going to spend all day every day just talking to that cashier about long-range strategic
[00:59:37] things for the company. I actually need that person up there, ringing up customers,
[00:59:41] as they're coming through. But if I, if I, as the CEO of that grocery chain or the CEO of that
[00:59:47] company, don't think that that cashier can't make a strategic, a tattoo just in this massive
[00:59:54] strategic implications. And I lose side of the fact that they actually do, at certain intervals,
[00:59:58] need to understand how what they do affects the big picture. Then I'm actually sent myself up
[01:00:03] for failure. Any Marine has ever been to Okuenawa, knows that when the Marine goes out and town
[01:00:07] steals a car and runs into a fire hydrant, that Marine doesn't just get in trouble for sealant
[01:00:12] a car. That is an inter-national incident that undermines the relationship between two countries.
[01:00:17] And it happens all the time. And if you don't think you're young folks that are doing this
[01:00:21] very tactical things, don't have to have some connection to the big picture enough to guide
[01:00:27] their day-to-day decisions. You are setting yourself up for long-term failure. And that works
[01:00:32] both ways. That cashier has to know, hey, I've got to treat this customer with some respect
[01:00:37] because if I don't, it's going to go on yellow, it's going to go on YouTube, it's going to go
[01:00:40] on Instagram or whatever that might be. And I could take down the whole company if I'm not careful.
[01:00:45] You know, I want to create paranoia, but they have to understand those small appearing to be small
[01:00:50] tattoo things can actually influence the entire organization. And they have to be able to make that
[01:00:55] connection. If you are in a situation like that and you're employing front line troops to carry out
[01:01:04] these sort of tactical day-to-day things, it's pretty easy to end up in the job market.
[01:01:11] The people that you're hiring, the human capital that you have available to you, it's pretty
[01:01:16] easy for them to be, hey, I actually, Dave C. E. O. Dave Burke, I actually don't really care about the
[01:01:23] company that much. And if you fire me tomorrow, I'll go get another minimum job, minimum wage
[01:01:28] jobs somewhere else and I don't really care. And so you sit here and tell me about how we can
[01:01:32] have a strategic loss at your company because I don't treat a client right, whatever, right?
[01:01:38] So what do you do then? And what do you have to do is you have to then explain two people
[01:01:46] that when that they have strategic goals in their life, that they need to have some kind of a
[01:01:54] path that they're going on. That hey, listen, listen echo Charles, I know you don't really care
[01:02:00] about work in here, that's fine. I get it. Listen, add a minimum. If you do a good job here,
[01:02:06] if you work here for six months, you work here for ten, 12 months, I don't know how long you're
[01:02:10] in work for here for. When you leave, I can give you a recommendation that'll get you a better job
[01:02:15] somewhere. That'll put you on a better path. And that's all I want. Look, I know you don't necessarily
[01:02:20] care about my company here. You don't like flipping burgers, I get it. But guess what?
[01:02:25] When you get done flipping burgers here, you can go get a job doing something that's a little
[01:02:30] bit better. So I don't, this isn't just about me and the company here, jockels burgers. Look,
[01:02:36] I'm going to be selling burgers for a long time. That's what I do. I love burgers. I know that
[01:02:41] this isn't your life goal. Guess what? What is your life goal? Where is it? Where are you at?
[01:02:46] Because I can promise you this. If you take care of me here, at some point, you're going to leave.
[01:02:50] I expect that. You got a lot of potential. When you leave here, I want to leave. I want you to leave
[01:02:55] on the best foot possible, set up for a long-term, better situation. I don't want you flipping
[01:03:00] burgers forever. But if you flip burgers well, that's the path to not flipping burgers, which is
[01:03:05] really interesting. One time I said, there was a person that talked about, uh, do I really need
[01:03:11] to learn GJ2 if I don't like to fight? And I said, that you actually should learn GJ2 more than
[01:03:17] anybody else if you don't like to fight. Echo, if you don't like flipping burgers, you more than
[01:03:23] anyone else should say, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to be the best burger
[01:03:27] flipper that I can be because that's going to allow me to step up into the next room because if you
[01:03:34] can't flip burgers, bro, how can I expect you to do anything else? You're definitely not stepping
[01:03:40] up to salad bar. And if you can't handle salad bar, you know, you're not going to be
[01:03:45] day opener. Right? And if you can't be the day opener, you're not going to be the general manager.
[01:03:49] If you're not the, well, if you're not going to be the storm manager, then the general manager,
[01:03:51] you see where this goes? And by the way, if you don't want to get in the restaurant business,
[01:03:56] that's fine too. When you go to work at a, at a mechanics shop, you want to be
[01:04:02] want to be an automotive mechanic. And that's where you want to go. What do I tell them when
[01:04:07] they call here to say, could Echo Charles flip burgers effectively and efficiently and reliably?
[01:04:13] And I have to say, no, he couldn't, he was late on a regular basis. Or whatever, what if I say,
[01:04:20] hey, you know what, Echo's, hey, he was totally reliable, good to go, great attitude. Yeah, if you,
[01:04:27] if you look in a higher somebody that's going to be able to be a real bonus inside your organization,
[01:04:33] Echo Charles the guy, that's what I want to do for you. But you got at least, you got to do
[01:04:40] something for me too. So if you're running it, if you're working with that, those those kind of
[01:04:44] entry level positions, sure, show them the strategic for the company for the business, but also show
[01:04:51] them strategically because, look, kids don't get that these days. I, but never mind, these days,
[01:04:57] I did, you know what, you know why I ended up doing okay in life is because I joined the navy.
[01:05:02] And they were like, do this and I said, Roger, wanted to be a good seal. Just that, that enough,
[01:05:08] that guidance, that, that goal was enough for me to like keep me out of trouble, keep me from being
[01:05:14] at total idiot. I was a partial idiot plenty of times. Kept me out of being a total idiot.
[01:05:20] So when you have the opportunity to show somebody, show a younger person, hey, what you're doing
[01:05:27] right now is connected to the future. You might want to think about it. Here's what is your future.
[01:05:31] Oh, okay. Well, you want to be whatever you want to be. First step is flip and burgers. And that's
[01:05:39] okay. Flip them good. Don't burn them. Keep them, keep them together.
[01:05:48] Note that these competitive advantages exist across the competition continuum and not only in the
[01:05:54] time of war, we conduct exercises in part to demonstrate that United States has a military capability.
[01:05:59] It could use if necessary. The existence of these capabilities can impose costs on a potential
[01:06:06] rival because the rival may need to expand resources if they want to overcome or negate a US
[01:06:13] competitive advantage as the rival pursuits are close. So you're, you're making other people pay
[01:06:21] another little, little plug for the Marine Corps. Hey, you got to have us. You got to have us,
[01:06:27] you got to have us well-training. You got to have us well prepared for battle because that makes
[01:06:30] everyone else even poses a cost on everybody else, which is a positive thing. Record needs more exercises.
[01:06:35] Yes. When viewed from this perspective, we gain an insight of into how a military competitive
[01:06:42] advantage can help us compete with a rival. Also note that it needs to be a conscious decision on
[01:06:48] when and how to reveal our most sensitive competitive advantages. At a minimum, we should leverage
[01:06:55] such revelations for advantage in the information element of power. Other capabilities might be
[01:07:01] cloaked in secrecy and so they actually need to be used. So they're awesome. Don't just reveal
[01:07:09] the special move that you have to kick someone's ass. Yeah, man. We're celebrating, I think,
[01:07:15] at least I am. This is the anniversary of the kickoff of Desert Storm. I think it was,
[01:07:20] well, when recorded, it's a couple of January 17th, 1991. That was the kickoff of Desert Storm.
[01:07:25] And I was kind of a kid wanting to be a pilot and the big reveal for us on that one that
[01:07:32] people don't understand is the stealth fighter. And all of a sudden, there's this big triple A in
[01:07:37] anti-aircraft system and it's going to be the Roomba Moserobus air defense system ever. And night zero,
[01:07:43] you know, in Iraq and all of a sudden things just are blowing up and Baghdad and nobody has any
[01:07:47] idea why they're just sitting there watching things blow up. There's nothing on radar. There's
[01:07:51] nothing out there as far as they know except they can hear airplanes flying overhead because the
[01:07:55] jet engines are making sound and then things are just blowing up. And we're basically told the
[01:07:59] world, oh, by the way, we hated to have to do this. But if you're wondering, this is what we can do.
[01:08:05] You might want to, and that's 30 years ago, our competitors are just just now, think the amount of
[01:08:12] time and money invested in them trying to build stealth technology, which has been a huge race
[01:08:16] in a big competition. We showed that to the world on day zero of the war. And as a pilot, obviously,
[01:08:22] we think about that too, as the competitive advantage makes other people go, well,
[01:08:27] maybe it's just not worth going to war with them. Maybe this just isn't worth it. Maybe this
[01:08:30] investment we're making is not worth it because they outcome, they can do things we need to
[01:08:33] know exist. So the revelation of that when carefully placed in time, well, can, can be a huge
[01:08:40] advantage. Yeah, not to mention they had no time to adapt to it because if we were to told them,
[01:08:44] they would have figured out some methodology or I'll tell you some attempt to figure out a more
[01:08:47] accurate radar or some kind of a defense system that could spot these aircraft overhead. Yeah,
[01:08:53] that's a great example of how you do it. It happens in GJ2, like if you have that move that you're
[01:09:00] pretty good at and you go for it, it's not a surprise anymore. I'm not saying you're not going to
[01:09:06] get it, but it's not a surprise. And now the person's expecting it to come. So you want if you're going
[01:09:12] to do it, might want to hang on to it just for, you know, a little bit deeper into that role,
[01:09:16] let that person be breathin' hard, let the O2 start to lack. All types of competitive advantages
[01:09:27] can atrophy, however, they all need appropriate practice exercising and improving if they are to remain
[01:09:33] advantages in the dynamic environment of international competition. Just so you can't, you can't rest
[01:09:39] on your laurels, ever. You can't rest on your laurels, ever. Competitors as systems, competitors are
[01:09:47] complex, adaptive systems. Again, this, this, this, competitors are complex, adaptive systems. I guess
[01:09:55] we kind of need to say it, right? We need to make it clear. And then, but it does make it even more
[01:10:01] clear, meaning they have many parts and these parts interact with each other in non-linear,
[01:10:05] often unpredictable ways. Consider Iran's national security decision-making structure. To some
[01:10:10] outside observers, they may appear to function as a strictly hierarchical organization with all
[01:10:17] important decisions being made by the Supreme Leader and President at the top of the pyramid,
[01:10:20] however, the rest story is much more complex. Much of the Supreme Leader's authority comes from
[01:10:25] informal relationships. He has with top commanders in the national security infrastructure
[01:10:30] and through the presence of his clerical representatives in military organizations. Even though
[01:10:35] the president is the chairman of the Supreme Council for national security, his power,
[01:10:40] EBS and flows because the Supreme Leader is the commander in chief and may bypass the president
[01:10:45] through his informal relationships. So, even in that, like they said, very strict, what one appears to
[01:10:56] be a strict hierarchy? It's all over the place. Guess what's more important? Relationships. Relationships
[01:11:03] are more important than the chain of command, even in an auto-cratic country like Iran.
[01:11:12] The military structure itself can act in under-predictable ways, especially the Islamic Revolutionary
[01:11:16] Guards. They've developed significant and separate political power based on its financial
[01:11:21] resources because it controls many businesses in almost every sector of the Iranian economy.
[01:11:27] Each of these power centers, among others, Jockey's for power inside Iran,
[01:11:30] working to advance their own internal or domestic interests. So, it's complicated.
[01:11:39] It's complicated. And you know what's crazy when you see videos, you ever seen videos in
[01:11:44] our pictures in Iran in like 19, whatever, 1973. It's totally westernized. It looks just like everything's
[01:11:53] good to go. Skip and forward a little bit, developing a model of how a competitor system fits
[01:12:02] together helps identify their competitive strengths, weaknesses, at a basic level, each of these
[01:12:07] systems consists of people, ideas, and things. The people make the system work. They also
[01:12:15] analyze its performance over time because they are also responsible for sustaining or improving
[01:12:20] the systems competitive advantages. The ideas of the system are found in the goals it pursues
[01:12:27] and in concepts it processes it uses to operate in the world. Mow famously stated politics
[01:12:36] is a war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed. This quote suggests a mindset
[01:12:41] that blurs the lines between peace and war. The mindset, this idea creates may give a competitor
[01:12:48] and advantage in operating near the threshold of violence. So, that statement from Mow is sort of
[01:12:55] the same thing that this whole, there's a continuum, right? You got politics, which is just war
[01:12:59] without blood. And then at some point you turn it into war. Now we got politics with bloodshed.
[01:13:03] But I'm going to dig into this one a little bit. Ideally, there are things then added or
[01:13:09] created to support the people and the ideas within the system. So we're talking about people,
[01:13:13] ideas, and things. With this in mind, within the system helping it achieve its goals.
[01:13:22] With this in mind, we can look at a competitor system and create a model of how it fits together,
[01:13:27] where it is strong, and where it is vulnerable. Finally, after creating this model, Marines must remain
[01:13:34] disciplined in its use. Models are useful, but in perfect, they are theories about the systemic
[01:13:40] structure of our rival. We need to remain alert for opportunities to improve our models
[01:13:46] as we learn more about how our competitors operate in the real world. Now this is the thing that
[01:13:52] so they talk about the simple people, ideas, and things. That's sort of what a competitor system is.
[01:14:01] And I added, well, this is up for debate, but I'll throw it out there for you. People,
[01:14:07] ideas, and things. That's sort of what you judge how your competitors are going to operate.
[01:14:14] I think perhaps there is possibly one more that needs to be added.
[01:14:18] And it may be covered by people, and it may be covered by ideas, and it not things, but a little bit.
[01:14:26] That is the idea of execution or taking action. So you can have people, you can have ideas,
[01:14:35] and you can have things. But if you can't execute, then you're dead in the water. Now,
[01:14:44] you could say that it's people that need to make things execute. So, okay, I get that. But I just
[01:14:50] felt the need to kind of call that out because when I look at a competitor, I think about,
[01:14:59] yes, they got these people. Yes, they got their, they got this team. They've got these ideas. Okay,
[01:15:03] I get, they've got some competitive advantages there, or disadvantages. And they've got things. They got
[01:15:09] them, they've got things. But all three of those things without execution, to me, I'm not even worried
[01:15:16] about you. I'm not even worried about you. If you can't execute. So, I don't know. Am I, am I
[01:15:23] reaching to you? Am I not giving enough credit to people? Possibly? Yeah, I mean, I guess that you
[01:15:29] could dig into deeper on what they mean by that. But when you said it, the first thing that went into
[01:15:34] my mind works in the opposite direction, too, is that they might not have the best, well, most well-trained
[01:15:40] people. And maybe their tools are kind of outdated and their systems aren't so great because they're
[01:15:45] antiquated and maybe they don't have big budgets. But if these people have been executing and what
[01:15:49] with brought me to is how many times you've said on this podcast is who we were fighting in Iraq,
[01:15:54] who we were fighting against al-Qaeda. They're things, they're things were garbage. On paper,
[01:15:59] compared to ours, garbage. They were rusty. They were old. And there are people, and I don't mean
[01:16:06] it like there are people like something wrong with their people, but they didn't have the training
[01:16:09] we had. They didn't have the resources. They had their people weren't invested in in the way that we
[01:16:12] invested in our people. But you know what they had been doing? They'd been executing for a really
[01:16:18] long time. So that piece, and maybe somebody could say, well, that's what people is and
[01:16:23] might be missing that. But I'm thinking of people like, I know what American marines and soldiers,
[01:16:29] I know what those people are. And it's really easy to look across and go, those people, those people,
[01:16:34] and just dismiss what they are. But those people had been executing and they were really good as a result.
[01:16:40] And offset where we thought we had this big advantage. Look at our gear. Look at our training. On paper,
[01:16:46] it should have been a one side of the fair. If you measured it with those things and what they weren't
[01:16:51] measuring was the value of the, I think what you're saying is the execution. Yeah, and even
[01:16:56] what you just said, like, if you take a group of marines or you take a group of soldiers,
[01:17:03] and they have training and it's all good. But if they don't execute and you could say, well,
[01:17:08] a marine is going to execute. We know that's actually not true. It's a good ideal. We could say
[01:17:14] a soldier is going to soldier with a, with a, with a platoon leader is going to execute.
[01:17:19] Not necessarily true. Not only, yeah. So to me, it's almost like a four thing that does make
[01:17:25] sense in there. Yeah. I actually thought that the third one was going to be the execution.
[01:17:30] People things and people people ideas ideas and execution. Yeah. That what, so it's almost like
[01:17:38] and listening to you guys and you said a good thing. You said, um, Dave, sit on paper.
[01:17:42] Because like that's kind of really what that whole thing kind of seems like it is because,
[01:17:46] okay, so you got people ideas and things. But people and ideas is, it's almost like people is what
[01:17:54] you can do and then execution is what you will do. So the, so again, on paper, where you have this
[01:18:01] capability, you have this many people with this capability with these tools and what they can do with
[01:18:07] these tools and then, but then just like I said, it doesn't mean that they're going to do. Yeah.
[01:18:12] Yeah. You know, like just, you guys say default aggressive. It's like that's that, that third kind of
[01:18:18] thing that you have to implement to create this execution. You ever seen an MMA fight that was about
[01:18:24] to happen and on paper, the got fighter A should destroy fighter B and what, what is the problem
[01:18:32] when he loses? Yeah. The problem is he doesn't execute. Yeah. The, the good and not to go too deep into
[01:18:37] the MMA thing. So remember certain, uh, cowboy, surrounding the animal, the animal, the animal,
[01:18:41] connamo-grigger, right? So you, like, Soroni is an executor guy. He executes, he executes, but then Connor is
[01:18:48] like a cerebral guy, like he'll play up stuff before the fight as well to kind of create that, that third
[01:18:53] man in the ring. And that third man in the ring, in this case, was to get in the way of execution.
[01:18:59] And there's like a video on it to that theorize this where connamo-grigger was usually he's talking
[01:19:05] trash to the guy telling them basically how much like junker of a fighter than he then he is or whatever,
[01:19:11] but it was the opposite this time. It was like he was saying, oh man, I respect him and it was friendly.
[01:19:15] He was really friendly actually. So it theoretically created this mindset on Donald Soroni's in his mind.
[01:19:23] Yeah. That's like all of that. And it kind of took away from his execution instinct, you know.
[01:19:29] So he was like, oh, it's like, oh, it's not as we're kind of frozen away. You know, it's like super
[01:19:34] respectful fight. And then you see Connor how he came out in the fight all crazy. And it's almost like
[01:19:40] he almost, you know, weird way surprised him, which how hard he was executing on a guy who usually
[01:19:46] executes, but that element didn't seem to be there as much, you know. So it's like man, that execution
[01:19:52] part of it, but that's a huge deal. Yeah. And just props to Calboy, props to Connor. Calboy,
[01:20:01] dude, he, he's got some scorer. And he does eight million other things.
[01:20:13] I wrote something down as you were getting to those, you know, connecting those two paragraphs.
[01:20:19] And it's, it's really interesting to hear the conversations that you just had and that adding
[01:20:24] that additional piece, I wrote down in my margin here, you don't know. And so this model,
[01:20:29] this thing, this we create and and the military does this all that we make create models for
[01:20:34] everything. And we're like, hey, I'm going to run a thousand simulations against my machine and
[01:20:37] that we do models for everything. We create this. And it was saying, hey, don't rely on that model.
[01:20:43] That's even more evidence. The, the, you don't know, we can create a model that can be useful
[01:20:49] for what, competitions can be like what we think the economies are going to look like. And we
[01:20:52] can look at history. We can create a whole bunch of things that help us make decisions. But at the end of
[01:20:56] all that you don't know, you don't know. And so if you don't know how useful is it getting back
[01:21:04] to the first thing is how useful is it to dig in on your way of doing? If you really don't know,
[01:21:08] and that's really what this is saying. Even, I could say, Jockel, I've run the numbers. I've done
[01:21:13] this analysis. I've compared to these last three, a row, I should say, if I could give you a thousand
[01:21:17] reasons why this is the answer. And at the end, I should say, but I still don't know, because you
[01:21:23] don't know. And that's really part of what this is saying to. And the piece in there, when you
[01:21:27] talk about the implementation, that's where the execution, where it's all going to happen. So not knowing
[01:21:34] and acknowledging you don't know is also a really powerful thing. And you're building this
[01:21:38] framework in your mind of how things are going to be. Yeah. It also, that introduces the idea of
[01:21:45] I know what you think is going to happen. And I'm not going to allow that to occur, which is,
[01:21:52] you know, what game you think, if I can convince you that all right, Dave, you and I are going
[01:21:57] to stand up. And you see this is like the the the most lame example, but you know, some of
[01:22:04] it's like, oh, you know, some wrestler that's like, no way, I'm going to, I'm going to knock him out. I'm
[01:22:09] going to knock him out. I'm going to knock him out. I'm going to knock him out. And he's trying to convince
[01:22:12] the other person that like we're going to stand in fights. You don't have to worry about your ground
[01:22:15] game or whatever. And then he goes out and takes him down and does what he's going to do. It's
[01:22:20] this, what game are you going to play? Like, I'm going to get you out of your game. That's what I'm
[01:22:27] going to do. Take away your competitive. Yeah, actually, Jeremy Stevens against Petus Anthony Petus.
[01:22:33] And you know, Anthony Petus is a striker primarily. And I was cornering Jeremy on that fight.
[01:22:41] And Jeremy's got, you know, fists of lead. And he knocks people out. And he he might not be the
[01:22:50] most technical striker. I'm not saying he's not technically not. I would say he's not as technical
[01:22:54] as Anthony Petus was at that time. And so we're going into the fight. Jeremy definitely going
[01:23:01] into the fight thinking, hey, it's been no cool. I'm going to stand up. I know I can take a punch.
[01:23:06] And I'm going to connect at some point with Petus's chin. And I'm going to win. What did Petus do?
[01:23:11] Came out, took him down. And it was a surprise. It's surprised to me. It's a surprise to Jeremy.
[01:23:18] And that's the way it went. But he changed. He did what we didn't expect him to do, which is just
[01:23:22] a brilliant move, right? So all the things that you think you know,
[01:23:28] done happen had another fighter was like, hey, aren't you going to work ground game? And he's like,
[01:23:33] I can't, I'm not going to get taken down by this guy. And I said, man, you better at least,
[01:23:37] you know, work to get off your back. I'm not going to get taken down. He's not good enough
[01:23:42] of a wrestler to take me down. He's a striker. Okay. Cool. What happened? This, this is after the
[01:23:48] lessons learned, right? The lessons learned from Jeremy is, you better be ready for whatever,
[01:23:51] you better train to fight. Because you can't predict what the, what you're saying Dave,
[01:23:57] I can't predict what the enemy is going to do. Can't predict it. I don't know what the enemy's
[01:24:01] going to do. I might think one thing, but I can't, that doesn't mean I can blow off every other
[01:24:05] possibility at all. What I need to do is be prepared too fight. You know, the closest thing that they
[01:24:11] say in this is a performance, they kind of, I'm trying, I like Doug Fetus, like, where are my missing,
[01:24:18] it maybe they are talking about execution numbers, don't see it? Like the closest I think they
[01:24:21] have is they say analyze, you know, the, the opponents performance over time. So your sort of talking
[01:24:28] about execution maybe he doesn't really do it, but I think maybe an additional item to assess
[01:24:34] your opponent is necessary. And that is people, ideas, things, and execution. We also look at
[01:24:44] our own system to increase our competitive advantages or create new ones. For example,
[01:24:50] do the people in our system have their necessary skills and aptitudes required to sustain
[01:24:55] our competitive advantages. Do they have the skills to build new ones? At a national level,
[01:25:00] does the target population for our recruiting efforts have the right education in a similar way?
[01:25:05] Can we look at our ideas? Do our operating concepts give us an advantage? And things do,
[01:25:11] does any of our equipment provide over match to evaluate our competitive system system? Again,
[01:25:17] to me, we can check the, we can check the ideas, we can check the things, we can check the people.
[01:25:21] I better check the execution because none of this stuff matters without execution.
[01:25:30] It's not always true that the organization with a new,
[01:25:33] istermost equipment wins the competition, quote Dave Burke. Sometimes aside, it is able to combine
[01:25:38] adequate material with innovative new ideas becomes the winner from this analysis. We can then
[01:25:43] increase our existing advantages or create new ones as deemed necessary.
[01:25:47] Means in competition. As similarly described, we're fighting the highest level of competition
[01:25:55] involves the use of all the elements of power. Marines are primarily concerned with the military
[01:25:59] aspects of competition, but we must not consider it an isolation from the other elements of
[01:26:04] national power. War fighting states, quote, the use of military force may take any number of
[01:26:10] forms from the mere deployment of forces as a demonstration of resolve to the enforcement of a
[01:26:16] negotiated truth, truth to general warfare with sophisticated weaponry.
[01:26:22] And, quote, here we see the alignment between our war fighting and competition doctrines start to
[01:26:26] immerse. So the whole point of this thing. In war, we impose our will on our adversary.
[01:26:34] Their cooperation is not required. Going back into influence and leadership, right?
[01:26:40] In competition, we make use of military force to attract or coerce.
[01:26:47] When using attraction, we use incentives, talking earlier about the carrot. We use incentives
[01:26:51] to induce arrival or other political actor to adopt a position favorable to us or otherwise allow
[01:26:57] us to reach our goals. And you know what? Sometimes we're going to talk about leadership,
[01:27:05] I talk about efficiency. And sometimes people think the most efficient thing for me to do is say,
[01:27:11] Dave, you need to use this route to get to the target. And people think that's the most of it.
[01:27:15] Hey, and it's really hard to see past that. Because clearly, if I have to say,
[01:27:21] you know, hey, Dave, well, how do you want to do it? And we have to have a discussion about it.
[01:27:24] It takes us another seven minutes before I finally comply with actually what you want to do.
[01:27:29] And that seems a lot less efficient. Yeah.
[01:27:31] But the efficiency comes out 10 fold in the field and in the execution. Let's think about the execution.
[01:27:42] It's because as a leader, you have to recognize that what you're doing is not getting
[01:27:46] to point eight a point to be in this patrol. That's not what the actual goal is. That might be
[01:27:51] this little mission. There's a little plack about what you're trying to do is create a leader.
[01:27:53] That at some point can go fight a war for you independently without you being there in a way that
[01:27:57] reinforce it. So it's this recognition that's not that's not even what you're trying to do.
[01:28:02] And it's that it's that mirage of this is the best way to get it done. I get your face to tell you
[01:28:08] what to do and look what happened. He did it mission accomplished. That is only true if the only thing
[01:28:15] you're actually doing is getting from point eight to point B, which simply is not what you're doing.
[01:28:19] That's not what you're doing. That's zero percent of the time. Zero. It's not what you're doing.
[01:28:24] When using coercion, we can pedal arrival to take an action in our favor or to stop taking
[01:28:31] an action that's not in our favor or we make use of military force to deter arrival from taking
[01:28:35] action in the first place. For both compelants and deterrence, our goal is to use the threat of
[01:28:41] military force to achieve our desired outcome. For this to be the case, our competitive advantage
[01:28:46] must be clear enough to our rival that it affects the decisions they make. What's interesting about
[01:28:51] this is when I'm your boss Dave, I have to remember that when I'm talking to you, there is
[01:29:01] the threat of me being able to fire you. I might not even say a word about it. So I have to kind of
[01:29:07] consciously mitigate that threat so that you will push back against me so that you will understand
[01:29:14] that I'm open to your ideas. I have to consciously do that. So I'm not just compliant. Just yeah,
[01:29:20] because that threat's there. And sometimes we work with companies where people are just scarred.
[01:29:25] No one will say anything back to the boss because the last boss with tyrannical idiot that
[01:29:29] barked everyone and told them what to do and fired half the organization and everyone was
[01:29:33] scared all the time to make a move. And that's why, by the way, that's why we show up there because
[01:29:38] the business is failing because there's total centralized community doesn't work.
[01:29:46] So you've got to use the threat of military force for this to be the case. Our competitive
[01:29:49] advantage must be clear enough for a rival to that it affects their decisions. Note that a competitive
[01:29:54] advantage does not necessarily equal military superiority, a competitive strength of will,
[01:29:59] along with non-military tools of policy are part of the equation too.
[01:30:05] Attraction, political actors often use various forms of attraction to achieve their goals,
[01:30:10] to attract someone to attract someone as to induce entice or persuade someone into doing something.
[01:30:15] And an negotiation is a reward or incentive for someone to make a choice that is favorable to us.
[01:30:21] We can say that then that attraction is the counterpoint to coercion instead of using pressure
[01:30:26] to help our goals, we use some type of reward instead. Okay, carrot, stick. That's what we're talking
[01:30:31] about. Marines participate in attraction strategies all the time demonstrating our professional
[01:30:37] commitment to our national values when conducting bilateral training. And recent years, for example,
[01:30:42] as part of US larger US attraction strategy, Marine provided training on amphibious operations
[01:30:48] to an important ally to Pan. Check. That's what that's what the Marines are doing all the time.
[01:30:54] That's what the entire military is doing all the time. That's what we need to
[01:31:00] continue to do. We get into coercion fast forward a little bit. Political actors often use
[01:31:06] coercion as a way to achieve their goals. To coerc someone as to pressure intimidate or force
[01:31:12] someone into doing something or to reach one goals through the use of pressure threat or force.
[01:31:19] There's a big difference in jujitsu between attraction and coercion.
[01:31:22] Right, attraction is like you get someone to defend their neck so that you can take their on.
[01:31:29] You can also force them to put themselves in a certain position. I guess that one's a little
[01:31:35] bit of a bad example because you kind of have to defend your neck. So you're coercing them to get
[01:31:39] those hands in position. It does this by influencing an adversary as a will or incentive structure.
[01:31:45] It is a strategy that often combines the threat of force. And if necessary, the limited controlled
[01:31:50] use of force with positive inducements, coercion as two forms, compelence and deterrence,
[01:31:55] compelence is a threat intended to make an adversary do something to take a specific action.
[01:32:00] And deterrence is a threat intended to inhibit an adversary from taking a particular action
[01:32:06] to prevent it from even getting started. In both cases, the target of coercion must be
[01:32:13] cooperate, must cooperate because the target must decide to comply with the goal of an actor
[01:32:18] who is applying the coercion. This cooperation is not friendly or willing but still must
[01:32:24] exist for coercion to be effective. Not friendly, not willing. So just to be clear, so the coercion
[01:32:32] positive and negative or the coercion, like, okay, I'm going to force this guy or intimidate
[01:32:38] this person to do something versus not versus, but then additionally the other coercion method
[01:32:47] is to intimidate them to not do something. Yes, either compeling them to do something or
[01:32:54] you're deterring them from doing something but you kind of have to participate in it.
[01:32:59] Right, like you got to quite like, you know, I don't know, this security guard or something. Like,
[01:33:04] hey, don't tell an aster don't whatever because we're going to go in this back door to rob the
[01:33:09] bank or whatever, you know, right? Like so if I'm a bank robber, I want to go rob the bank.
[01:33:13] Hmm, I know the security guard. I'm going to say, hey, I'm going to rob your bank. Don't stop us.
[01:33:19] Or else we're going to kill you with it. Okay, yes, that's coercion. Yeah,
[01:33:22] front to force him to not do something. Right, but he, but the point here is that he has to
[01:33:28] he has to be willing to do it. Right, right, right, you're not just for you could, you could take his
[01:33:33] head up where he can't even talk or move. Now, it doesn't matter where he's willing or not, he's not doing it.
[01:33:38] Right, but I'm saying, like, let's say the ability before the bank robbery, it's like when in the
[01:33:42] planning process, you know, maybe the bank robber, but the security guard is my neighbor or something.
[01:33:48] And then I'm going to be like, hey, we're going to rob the bank on your shift.
[01:33:51] Hmm, if so you can't call the cops, you know, you can't sound the alarm or whatever.
[01:33:56] Or kill you or kill you or whatever. It's coercion. Yeah, yeah. It's also a bad plan.
[01:34:01] Yeah, I would think so. But now he's going to tell on everybody before it happens.
[01:34:06] Not if I coerism correctly, you seem to say you better have like his child and the
[01:34:11] chunk of your car forever.
[01:34:15] See, it's not that bad. Yeah, you're right. You're right. The idea of using coercion in a competition can be
[01:34:20] misleading if we do not identify the assumptions that support its use. It's often assumed that a
[01:34:26] stronger nation can naturally coerce a weaker one into doing what it wants. However, this assumption may
[01:34:32] not be true if the weaker nation is willing to absorb or but more punishment than the stronger one
[01:34:37] can or will deliver or stay committed to its goals over a longer period of time. This is
[01:34:44] one of the things that we always have to think about this is in the Vietnam War when we try to say,
[01:34:51] you know what, we can kill 150 of them for every one of us that they kill and we said,
[01:34:57] that's a win. How do we lose that? How to say how you lose it? Those 150 mean less to the
[01:35:04] communist government than the one does to the American people in the American government.
[01:35:08] Yeah. When your model places the same value on people for your enemy as it does for yourself
[01:35:13] and go, we've run that nobody would tolerate this. We would never tolerate this loss.
[01:35:17] Well, they will. And I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking of when the Soviet Union
[01:35:22] innovative Afghanistan. And again, how lopsided that appeared, but in terms of the interest in what
[01:35:29] they were willing to endure and how long they were willing to endure. And sooner or later, it's like,
[01:35:32] hey, we can't do this anymore. We're done here. We're done here.
[01:35:38] It says the next week, we call this asymmetry of interest. In this case, the weaker nation has
[01:35:44] the more powerful desire to achieve its interest in the stronger nation. This is, you have to watch
[01:35:48] out for this. So you have to watch out for that from as a leader when you're working with a subordinate
[01:35:54] and you start to escalate through the continuum of influence. And you don't recognize that maybe
[01:36:01] they don't care if they get fired. And all you think, you know, you want more word out of you
[01:36:06] and you're going to get fired. And they don't care. The example as a parent with kids
[01:36:14] probably resonates with a lot of folks. Because as you know, certainly as your kids get older,
[01:36:19] that threat of violence becomes so much less useful. Like, hey, if you do this, I'm going to
[01:36:25] I'm going to ground you. Like, okay, I'll just sneak out of a few sneak out. I'm going to take
[01:36:29] a car away. Cool. And the willingness for them to just outlast you on principle alone or the
[01:36:35] willingness to endure whatever you are going to impose on them, you have to calculate in your mind.
[01:36:39] What they're willing to endure. So you want to hear about some of this calculation? So my, uh,
[01:36:46] my son had gotten a little out of line. This is when he was young. And he was in a very
[01:36:54] austere, I put him into a very austere environment to get him to coerced to understand what
[01:37:02] he had done wrong and how we don't do this kind of thing. And it was really strict. And it's
[01:37:10] not by the way, it's no fun for you for the parent, right? We don't want to be strict. We want to
[01:37:14] like have fun and it's all good and we want to buy toys and we want to just, but you, but when you
[01:37:19] go austere, then you're not doing any of that and it's not fun. So over time, as, you know, he,
[01:37:26] he was straightening out and he's probably like seven. And eventually, you know, he had gotten,
[01:37:33] you know, some toys back and then he had gotten, you know, his, he could use a pillow again and his
[01:37:38] bedroom and, uh, you know, those kind of creature comforts start to come back and then, you know,
[01:37:46] two, three months later, I, you know, something's little spark of like, wait a second.
[01:37:54] And, and what I called this, because he was young, I called this, uh, you know, I have to be strict
[01:38:00] with you. So then I started being less and less strict. He started getting some of these privileges back
[01:38:06] and then one time he started stepping online a little bit and I said, hey, am, am I going to have to
[01:38:11] get strict with you again? And he said something along the lines of like, I think maybe you should,
[01:38:19] so that I can be tougher. I always like, go, I was like, I did not, I was, I didn't want to be
[01:38:28] strict with. I want to, like, let's go back to party time. Yeah, let's go back to, we can, you know,
[01:38:32] play with toys and have a good, he says, maybe, maybe you should, so I can be tougher and I was
[01:38:37] damn it. He just won the test of wheels you want. Like, you can take, go ahead, you should,
[01:38:44] actually, actually, we're one level deeper, like you should. It's in my best interest for you to do that.
[01:38:50] Let's do it immediately. So you got to, you got to pay attention to kids or come at you.
[01:38:55] I'll come at you. Psychological warfare. Information,
[01:39:01] information plays a special role in competition. Narratives play an important part because they are
[01:39:09] what gives meaning to a set of facts. For example, to come, but two competitors may both as
[01:39:15] are to possess a particular island. One of them may have a narrative that explains their claim to
[01:39:19] the island on the basis of historical ownership. The other may have a narrative that says some
[01:39:23] of the people that currently use the island and current possession makes their claim stronger.
[01:39:28] Two narratives compete with each other to give facts and meanings. I got a good question on EF online
[01:39:34] the other day. I think it was EF on the might of an client, but it was along the lines of, hey,
[01:39:39] how do we develop this culture? And my answer was, you need to tell the story of what's going on
[01:39:44] in it. And when we talked about on the spotcast, the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps tells the story,
[01:39:49] yeah, that's how it's going off from the last podcast about about the squad leader makes a difference.
[01:39:54] That thing is primed and ready to rock and roll on the podcast. So the narrative that you tell
[01:40:00] the information that you put out there was just so important. Demonstrating a capability
[01:40:07] and exercise and then think and then communicating so that it affects a competitor's thinking
[01:40:14] is another way Marines use information. Leaders determine what capabilities to reveal and
[01:40:19] when to reveal them as part of a large approach. However, much specifically revealed,
[01:40:25] publicizing adherence to high standards in realistic training can help sustain the Marine
[01:40:30] Corps's reputational advantage and affect the thinking of our nation's competitors. Once again,
[01:40:35] the Marine Corps with this manual is increasing their budget. It's a traction for the DOD is what it is.
[01:40:44] Marines need to understand the impact of culture when they use information as a competitive tool.
[01:40:52] Cultural differences affect how narratives are interpreted by various audiences. One message
[01:40:57] might be understood in one country in a way that is significantly different from how it is understood.
[01:41:02] And another, Marines must account for this and focus the narratives we use so that our target
[01:41:07] audience understands our message the way that we intend. Yes, know the story.
[01:41:11] Know the story going back to the unraveling podcast. What is your story? Know people's stories.
[01:41:21] The spectrum and styles of competition. The next section. The usual condition of internal
[01:41:27] relations is one of competition across the elements of national power.
[01:41:33] Below the violence threshold, we typically see activities from the non-military aspects of national
[01:41:39] power. For example, economic competition is seen as a national level in the struggle for market
[01:41:45] chair in particular industry or the effort to negotiate favorable terms in a trade agreement.
[01:41:51] Asculation on the spectrum, we might see sharper economic acts like industrial espionage,
[01:41:56] the theft of internet and intellectual property, use of sanctions. What's interesting about this is
[01:42:02] how often do we go to war?
[01:42:03] Right, like if you think about all the interactions that America has globally for the last
[01:42:11] 240, 50 years, all these interactions all the time are constantly happening, tariffs and sanctions
[01:42:18] and all of these things are happening all the time. And very seldom do we actually pull the
[01:42:22] trigger across the national violence. And that's, we should do that as as infrequently as possible,
[01:42:31] obviously, and you should assess your own leadership in the same spectrum. How often do I have to
[01:42:36] use direct leadership? It should be extremely infrequently.
[01:42:48] Repetitive actions can also move the line up or down over time. This is about how you kind of
[01:42:54] move up and down these continuums all the time. Gradualism and salami slicing, which we talked
[01:43:01] about before last one, competitors use these activities in an effort to achieve their aims
[01:43:07] without provoking a state of war or even a strong reaction.
[01:43:16] In addition to competing through attraction, coercion and various forms illustrated above
[01:43:21] Marines can also compete by imposing costs. We impose costs on arrival when we develop a
[01:43:27] credible capability and arrival must spend resources in order to try and counter it.
[01:43:32] For example, the Department of Defense has experienced increasing cyber attacks in the past decades.
[01:43:38] This has imposed costs because the Department of Defense has to suspend time and money
[01:43:42] to develop civilian training, the count of those attacks. We can also fast forward when we can
[01:43:47] also impose costs during war when we first enforce the adversary to divert resources from their
[01:43:53] preferred actions in order to counter one of our capabilities. Then we get into the threshold of violence.
[01:44:02] The threat of violence and violent acts are competitive tools in international relations. The goal
[01:44:08] of posturing is to affect the decision making of the target to make them so fearful of the
[01:44:13] damage they might receive if the posturing escalates to violence that they submit and let the
[01:44:17] posture achieve their goals. And it places one into a favorable position should violence follow.
[01:44:24] Just think about that psychologically. If we start to think about the continuum of influence or leadership
[01:44:31] and you start using direct influence, that's what you're doing. You're crossing over that threshold
[01:44:39] where people are forced to submit. That's why you get the equal and opposite reaction.
[01:44:46] In some cases, the posturing briefly crosses the threshold and violence occurs to demonstrate
[01:44:51] the resolve of the actor. This brief use of violence still has the same aim which is to affect
[01:44:57] the target's decision. Many actors intentionally try to obscure or confuse exactly where this
[01:45:04] threshold lies. That's a good one. Where is that threshold? You ever known someone that just
[01:45:14] crazy eyes, like a crazy eyes person? How about your bouncing at a bar? There's some people where
[01:45:21] you don't know where the line is. They could shank you at any moment. Right? And now you have to
[01:45:26] contend with that. And there's people that proactively proactively prop up that image. It's a good move.
[01:45:41] Where you have, you might think that's a good move as a leader. But what you're really doing is
[01:45:47] now what you're doing is you're inducing more fear. And now people don't know when you're going to
[01:45:52] lash out. And so now they're on eggshells and they're afraid to speak up and speak out. And it's a problem.
[01:46:05] This has been, oh, um, they do this to cause enough ambiguity and hesitation that they can
[01:46:13] achieve their aims with little or no interference. This has been true historically. And we'll
[01:46:17] likely increase in the future some rivals use capabilities like certain cyber and space activities
[01:46:21] that have destructive effects but false short of some definitions of violence and effort to obscure
[01:46:26] whether or not they would across the threshold as a push on the on the low. And support a U.S.
[01:46:32] calls Marines perform missions on both sides of the violence threshold. In some case,
[01:46:36] Marines were introduced into situations below the violence threshold. But then a political group
[01:46:41] performed a violent act against U.S. interests. The discipline response of the Marines then occurred
[01:46:47] above the threshold of violence, but the violence was limited and did not reach the level of conventional
[01:46:52] war following these brief periods of violence. The competition again fell below the violence
[01:46:57] threshold in most cases. Now we get into decision making initiative and response.
[01:47:06] You might just call that a whole thing execution. I'm not 100% sure, but you might.
[01:47:10] So Marines are taught that decision making is essential since all actions are the result of decisions
[01:47:18] or of non-decision. It's so powerful to paint things so clearly. This is whoever wrote this
[01:47:30] opener right here because you know how many people wrote this book Dave. Six six six six
[01:47:36] six. The person at the wrote this section gets a little bonus credit.
[01:47:42] Marines are taught that decision making is essential since all actions are the result
[01:47:47] of decisions or non-decisions. If we lack the will required to make a decision then we have
[01:47:54] willingly surrendered the initiative to our full. If we consciously postpone taking action for
[01:48:02] For some reason, this is also a decision.
[01:48:06] So there you go.
[01:48:07] Boom.
[01:48:10] That's the little section.
[01:48:11] You got to highlight terminal lands out there.
[01:48:14] I mean, this is what we're talking about.
[01:48:16] Initiative is as important in competition as it is in war, gaining the initiative means
[01:48:22] our competitor must react to us.
[01:48:25] We can gain it by presenting a dilemma to our competitor and also by setting the tempo
[01:48:30] of the activity taking place.
[01:48:35] Brian Stan, when he was on here's operational tempo.
[01:48:38] He loved, he loved, he loved everyone's got their move.
[01:48:42] In Gigi, two of them got their, they got that key, a team.
[01:48:45] They got that Camira, they got that heel hook.
[01:48:49] When Brian Stan was on here, I just remember him talking about that operational tempo
[01:48:52] where it's going to, and I'll, that's what he's, that's what this guy's talking about.
[01:48:59] Setting the tempo of the activity.
[01:49:01] Marines must assume that potential competitors understand initiative as well as we do.
[01:49:07] Thus they will take actions in order to gain the initiative.
[01:49:10] Many competitors also seek to create ambiguity about their actions which leads to a problem
[01:49:15] of attribution.
[01:49:17] If we are not certain who performed a certain action, then we cannot attribute that
[01:49:21] action to any particular actor.
[01:49:23] This often delays our response and slows our tempo.
[01:49:27] Firstly, if we improve understanding of how of our competitor, we can be primed to attribute
[01:49:33] their actions in ways that slow their tempo instead.
[01:49:38] To know that and to be able to recognize, oh, this isn't just, it's not just that I can't
[01:49:43] figure out exactly who did this.
[01:49:46] It's that I am now my Udalupe is slowing down right now.
[01:49:50] Because I think they did it, but I can't be sure.
[01:49:56] While competition essentially always exists, it's intensity varies over the course of time.
[01:50:03] We must also understand that the long timelines involved in competition mean decisions and
[01:50:07] actions sometimes play out over months or years, even decades in some cases.
[01:50:10] This often results in opportunistic behavior as rivals take advantage of conditions to achieve
[01:50:16] their strategic goals without crossing the violence threshold or crossing it briefly.
[01:50:22] And then returning low to threshold before triggering a war.
[01:50:25] The journey is often created when conditions suddenly change or temporarily, such as when
[01:50:30] a pandemic strikes, a pandemic strikes, which is interesting.
[01:50:33] I don't know if they wrote this before or after.
[01:50:36] I get they probably slid it in there.
[01:50:38] You think they slid it in there?
[01:50:39] Yeah, I think this was drafted like this last year.
[01:50:41] Yeah, they slid it in there such as this diverts attention and resources which creates
[01:50:47] a gap for an alert competitor to exploit.
[01:50:53] Having no fixed timeline for achieving goals, plus opportunism also leads to incrementalism,
[01:51:02] which is the effort to achieve a goal by adding together a number of small steps taken
[01:51:07] on a path toward it.
[01:51:10] Achieving our goals in competition requires action which comes from making decisions.
[01:51:16] Therefore what Marines are taught for war fighting serves them well here provided, they
[01:51:21] also apply judgment in recognizing how timelines can differ between war and the rest of the
[01:51:26] competition continuum.
[01:51:28] So this idea of incrementalism is something you got to be on the lookout for.
[01:51:32] You got to be on the lookout for that slow creeping maneuver that your enemies making.
[01:51:40] And at some point you got to draw the line what I recommend is instead of drawing a line,
[01:51:47] what you do is you incrementally respond.
[01:51:51] So when that go, makes it a little maneuver, that's a little bit offensive to me.
[01:51:57] I just don't say well he hasn't really crossed the line.
[01:52:00] I actually give a little bit of a check, a little check.
[01:52:02] That's a little check.
[01:52:04] So from a leadership perspective, what does that mean?
[01:52:06] It means when Dave, when Dave decides he's going to spend a little bit too much money on the
[01:52:12] company credit card, I don't just go well, I don't really eat him like cross line.
[01:52:18] I might say, hey Dave, I see I see got it some expenses here that are, what is this?
[01:52:24] What did you buy?
[01:52:26] Just check and oh yeah, I just needed some oil for my car.
[01:52:32] Okay, but for your car.
[01:52:34] Yeah, yeah, well, okay.
[01:52:37] Was that for a company trip?
[01:52:38] No, no, no, no, no, I'll change.
[01:52:41] I'll talk to you.
[01:52:42] We'll get it straight now.
[01:52:43] Okay, because you're trying to incrementally see if you can start putting real stuff on
[01:52:47] the company credit card.
[01:52:49] No, you can't.
[01:52:52] But if I don't check you, if instead I draw a line in the sand, well now all of a sudden
[01:52:57] you've developed a pattern and you've gotten a habit and you could actually come back
[01:53:00] to me and say well, I'll be doing this for a while.
[01:53:02] I don't want any of that.
[01:53:03] So I'm going to check you.
[01:53:06] Am I going to check you with a, with a hockey stick across the face?
[01:53:11] No, I'm going to give you a little test a little.
[01:53:14] I'm here.
[01:53:15] I see what's happening.
[01:53:17] I don't draw a line in the sand because in a line in the sand can be offensive.
[01:53:25] Yeah.
[01:53:26] And why did you break a rule if you knew the rule is there?
[01:53:34] If you broke a rule, I probably did a bad job of explaining that hey man, company credit
[01:53:40] cards, we use them for company business.
[01:53:44] And what we can't do is we can't have a bunch of little charges adding up over time and
[01:53:49] then we look up and we, we have lost a bunch of money and spending on things that don't really
[01:53:54] benefit the company.
[01:53:56] So anything that you think you're using for your personal gain or for your personal life
[01:54:04] is not allowed.
[01:54:07] So that's a little bit of a line, but I'm not, I'm not smack in you with it.
[01:54:11] I'm showing it to you.
[01:54:13] And you've got, you have options when you take that approach.
[01:54:16] You can, there's a lot of different things you can do in there.
[01:54:20] And the, the problem with the line is that that basically commits you to, to, to a response
[01:54:27] to a course of action that you, it's really, really hard to maneuver away from that.
[01:54:32] And if you're using the line like, hey, if I just draw the line, then, then Jocco's
[01:54:35] not going to cross the line.
[01:54:37] I use it more as a tool to keep you from doing it than it's actually what I'm really willing
[01:54:40] to do.
[01:54:41] You have almost no maneuver space there.
[01:54:44] And you talk about that's all the time.
[01:54:45] You want to keep as many options as much maneuverability as you can.
[01:54:49] And that line takes all that away from me.
[01:54:51] And if the line is just a tool to get you to comply.
[01:54:54] And that person, this is talking about an adversary.
[01:54:57] This is an alert adversary looking for ways to commit you that limits anything that limits
[01:55:03] your options.
[01:55:04] And certainly I know this about the Marine Corps is something we don't want.
[01:55:07] Isn't a beautiful thing when the line is implied with such strength that I never even
[01:55:15] set it, but you're new, not to cross it.
[01:55:17] How many how many charges have you made on your company credit card for your personal
[01:55:21] game?
[01:55:22] The answer is zero.
[01:55:23] Right?
[01:55:24] And not doing that here.
[01:55:25] And not out of fear of compliance either.
[01:55:27] Or, or compliance based on fear, but out of a recognition of why that actually is what
[01:55:32] you should be doing.
[01:55:34] And there's some things inside here that translate perfectly.
[01:55:37] And there's some things you actually have to think about because this publication, this
[01:55:44] manual is really in a lot of ways talking about competitors.
[01:55:48] And there's a component there that directly aligns well when you're competing with
[01:55:55] you're running a company.
[01:55:56] There's a competitive company.
[01:55:58] But the connection to the leadership piece to your people, you got to kind of translate that
[01:56:04] a little bit.
[01:56:05] You don't want to go to war with your people.
[01:56:06] Your goal isn't to set that line to establish your authority so they comply.
[01:56:10] You want to avoid that.
[01:56:12] It almost all costs.
[01:56:15] But you need your into same thing with my kids.
[01:56:17] Do I want my son to know that there's a line?
[01:56:20] Yes.
[01:56:21] He and he knows.
[01:56:23] He almost, well, it happens, but he doesn't cross that line very often.
[01:56:26] I'm not forced to respond in a limited way very often.
[01:56:30] But I want him to know that.
[01:56:31] So let's say there is a street in front of your house, really busy.
[01:56:36] Would you put the line that you're son when he's four years old?
[01:56:41] Would you put the line at the street?
[01:56:43] No.
[01:56:44] How no.
[01:56:45] You put the line a little further back.
[01:56:46] And would you then escalate like, hey, you can't go past this?
[01:56:52] This is 20 yards from the road where you could get killed.
[01:56:56] That's what we do.
[01:56:57] Yeah.
[01:56:58] Even the actual line where you're going to like give significant punishment because
[01:57:03] you have to impress upon the kid, like my dog, kid dog.
[01:57:12] My dog, I have this.
[01:57:14] And my house, if my dog goes out off my front porch, he's going to be on a street with
[01:57:21] his car.
[01:57:24] I gave him hard corrections when he was a puppy that now I've done leave there.
[01:57:28] He knows what's up.
[01:57:30] He knows that he can't do it.
[01:57:31] So that's where the line isn't.
[01:57:34] He could go off my porch and go another 15 yards before he'd actually get hit.
[01:57:40] But I don't give him that extra 15 yards.
[01:57:42] I give him like, okay, here it is.
[01:57:43] Don't go across this line and he's been trained and he understands it.
[01:57:48] So that's what you got to watch out for.
[01:57:52] When your dog might not ever make this connection, but the obvious goal with your people
[01:57:57] is that the recognition is that it's in their business.
[01:58:00] You're trying to help them.
[01:58:01] And that's the piece of like, hey, when you're talking about your adversaries and you
[01:58:05] haven't talked a little bit about coercion.
[01:58:07] In some way, we're actually even though our adversaries basically trying to say, hey, don't
[01:58:12] do this.
[01:58:13] This is in your best interest.
[01:58:15] Please don't do this.
[01:58:17] Or, hey, I'm going to really need you to do this.
[01:58:20] But from a leadership standpoint, all those things, even those lines that you draw, the ideal
[01:58:25] situation is usually it's actually what's in their best interest and they're pushing
[01:58:29] against it.
[01:58:30] You might want to find out why they're pushing against that.
[01:58:32] Anyway, I just think that that connection of what's in their best interest and that
[01:58:38] that line, I mean, we, you want to be able to maneuver as much as possible all the time
[01:58:43] and keep as many options open as possible.
[01:58:47] So that line should be just be real cautious about drawing that explicitly.
[01:58:52] And if you do, if you can get them to understand why that's there, that's so much more powerful
[01:58:55] than it's just, hey, I'm going to hand me if you hit the cross line.
[01:58:58] Yeah.
[01:59:00] The Y is huge.
[01:59:02] And if they don't understand why, then it's an arbitrary thing that you threw up there.
[01:59:07] And look, I'm not saying that you shouldn't have that.
[01:59:09] Because if people, you should absolutely have lines where, hey, you cross this line,
[01:59:13] you made it as ethical mistake, you do something that's actively freaking criminal.
[01:59:19] You're done.
[01:59:20] That's where we're at.
[01:59:21] Just so everybody knows, you do something like that.
[01:59:25] You're done.
[01:59:26] Period end of story.
[01:59:27] There's no, there's not even discussion.
[01:59:28] So don't do that.
[01:59:34] Getting into the conclusion, like war, competition serves policy, but usually does so
[01:59:39] over longer spans of time, these long time lines lead us to look for policies, aims in our enduring
[01:59:46] national interests with aspects of these interests emphasized by current state of domestic
[01:59:51] policies, politics.
[01:59:52] Again, apply that to your personal life, apply that to your business.
[01:59:57] What are you trying to do?
[01:59:58] What are your enduring interests?
[02:00:03] Attraction is important concept in our theory of competition.
[02:00:06] It uses incentives and rewards to get another political actor to act differently in ways
[02:00:11] that are aligned with our interests.
[02:00:12] That's what we're doing as a leader.
[02:00:14] We're using attraction.
[02:00:17] We're using coercion.
[02:00:19] We're using the stick.
[02:00:20] We're using the carrot.
[02:00:21] What do we want to use?
[02:00:22] We want to use the carrot as much as possible.
[02:00:27] And you know what?
[02:00:28] We want them to think they found that carrot.
[02:00:34] Our version is another important component of our theory.
[02:00:37] It takes two forms, compelence to cause a rival to take action favorable to our goals and
[02:00:43] deterrence to cause a rival to not take action.
[02:00:47] That's what you were asking earlier, I think.
[02:00:49] I don't know if I gave you that clear of an answer.
[02:00:53] In war, we impose our will on an enemy.
[02:00:55] With coercion, we need our rivals cooperation because they must decide to comply with
[02:01:00] our wishes.
[02:01:02] And if their cooperation is unwilling, the existence of the Marine Corps is a coercive
[02:01:07] tool for the nation.
[02:01:09] If its competitive advantages advantage is made clear to a rival.
[02:01:16] Competitors act like systems.
[02:01:17] They have many parts that interact with each other in complex, often unpredictable ways.
[02:01:23] This also means competitors have strengths and weaknesses as competition unfolds over time.
[02:01:28] The rival systems can sense what their competitor is trying to do and adapt or evolve in
[02:01:35] an effort to improve their competitive advantage.
[02:01:37] It's always adapting.
[02:01:39] These will often blend the threat of violence or the use of violence itself with other
[02:01:44] tools to gain an advantage.
[02:01:47] This constantly shifting mixture can get confusing, which is part of the goal.
[02:01:53] Competitors often intend for this confusion to help them reach their goals by causing their
[02:01:57] rivals to hesitate.
[02:02:01] This also helps them gain the initiative so that they can set the pace of the tempo for
[02:02:08] the competition.
[02:02:09] I'm more or two hours deep right now.
[02:02:14] I'm not even getting it.
[02:02:15] Well, the chapter three is next.
[02:02:20] You know, something that I say and I think you and I discussed this the other day on the
[02:02:28] phone Dave, the best way to win is when the enemy doesn't even know the fighting.
[02:02:34] What Sunsu was, the supreme, what Sunsu said was the supreme art of war is to subdue the
[02:02:40] enemy without fighting.
[02:02:43] That's what we're trying to do.
[02:02:46] To win, to influence Dave without Dave even knowing that I influenced him.
[02:02:54] I want to maneuver my ideas into your head so that you think they're, they're, they're your
[02:02:58] ideas.
[02:03:01] I want to preemptively remove your will to fight before you even think you should be
[02:03:05] in a fight before before you even think you should be putting up resistance.
[02:03:10] You already are thinking that you don't want to resist.
[02:03:12] That's my goal.
[02:03:13] I want to make you a champion of my cause as if it were your own cause.
[02:03:22] That's what we're trying to make happen.
[02:03:25] And by the way, what what makes this easy?
[02:03:28] Er, what makes this and actually makes it easy is when my cause is your cause because
[02:03:35] you're, it helps you.
[02:03:37] If I'm over here trying to convince you to do something that doesn't help you, man, it's
[02:03:39] freaking hard.
[02:03:41] But when I can align my goals with your goals and I can give you ownership, that allows,
[02:03:50] that allows these strategies and tactics for you to get on board with what I want you
[02:03:58] to do and you don't even know that I'm trying to make you do it.
[02:04:06] So this one of the most important things about this manual is simply making you aware
[02:04:11] that you're competing and you have to be aware that you're also influencing all the time
[02:04:18] and you're on that spectrum and you're on that continuum and you're either gaining leadership
[02:04:24] capital or you're spending it.
[02:04:30] And if you do it right, people are on board.
[02:04:34] And the deeper part of that is you are actually propelling them towards victory, form
[02:04:41] or them.
[02:04:44] If you do it right, you're propelling them towards victory and they are happy to be
[02:04:49] moving there.
[02:04:52] And if I'm trying to get Dave to do something that he's resistant to and it's going
[02:04:57] to help him in the long run, it's going to help us in the long run.
[02:05:00] Why is he resistant?
[02:05:01] I need to listen to him to see what his resistance is.
[02:05:04] Why is he resisting?
[02:05:11] That's what we're doing.
[02:05:13] We're on a constant continuum of influence.
[02:05:20] Yes, we're competing but we're influencing as leaders.
[02:05:29] We're also competing obviously.
[02:05:38] We want to stay competitive in a multitude of ways.
[02:05:42] We'll say any ways that you can recommend for us to maybe maintain or improve our competitive
[02:05:52] advantage in the world.
[02:05:53] What do you think?
[02:05:54] First one, which I think goes unnoticed and you do good job in reminding us from time
[02:06:03] to time is what game are you playing?
[02:06:07] Isn't that one of the questions you always get?
[02:06:10] What motivates you?
[02:06:12] Right, you get that one a lot.
[02:06:14] Still kind of a question that you kind of got to ask yourself a lot of the time.
[02:06:20] Because it kind of seems like okay, so getting in shape, for example, or being
[02:06:24] in shape, shape, and shape whatever.
[02:06:26] For some for the average person, whatever that even means because I don't know what that
[02:06:30] actually even is.
[02:06:31] But to wake up before 30 and do and it's not like you're waking up in 430 and doing
[02:06:37] a stretching routine for 10 minutes, like you're kind of going hard.
[02:06:45] That's every single day.
[02:06:46] Not to say you're going full speed every single day.
[02:06:49] But I'm just saying your routine is like the average person not going to do that.
[02:06:54] So you're over here going hard.
[02:06:57] But why?
[02:06:58] You know?
[02:06:59] Competitive advantage.
[02:07:00] Yes.
[02:07:01] Competitive advantage.
[02:07:02] Exactly.
[02:07:03] So what I'm saying is in your head it's there.
[02:07:05] But I think in like a lot of our head this segment is not always there like we've got
[02:07:08] to kind of get reminded everyone's own.
[02:07:10] You know, just to confirm things in the world.
[02:07:14] You know, in discipline it goes freedom field manual.
[02:07:16] But let's talk about like how if you exercise, you'll be sharper mentally sharper.
[02:07:24] And then hearing that chess player the other day Gary Kasparov talk about how if you're
[02:07:30] in shape it's going to help you win at chess.
[02:07:32] I was like keep working out people.
[02:07:36] Keep working out people.
[02:07:38] That's what you need to do.
[02:07:39] Yeah.
[02:07:40] And you're kind of always your mind's kind of seems to be anyway always kind of in that
[02:07:44] zone where it's like you're kind of looking for some kind of advantage or something to add
[02:07:50] to, you know, your deal or whatever.
[02:07:52] But for the every person, I think some of us don't do that all the time because we kind
[02:07:56] of forget or maybe to get distracted or whatever.
[02:07:59] Maybe that's the same thing.
[02:08:00] But where that's why people they'll work out less.
[02:08:03] More things going on all this stuff, right?
[02:08:05] So they forget.
[02:08:06] Yeah.
[02:08:07] Yeah.
[02:08:08] You got that.
[02:08:11] Let's face it.
[02:08:12] You pour all your efforts into your job.
[02:08:17] Your family and your physical health are going to fall.
[02:08:20] If you pour all your efforts into your family, your job and your physical health is going
[02:08:25] to fail.
[02:08:26] If you pour all your efforts into your physical health, your job and your family are
[02:08:30] going to fail.
[02:08:33] So we have to be balanced.
[02:08:37] If you let the physical one fall apart, that's going to negatively impact the other.
[02:08:41] I actually, they all, they all impact each other, right?
[02:08:43] They all impact each other.
[02:08:44] But let's face it as you pointed out on one of the earliest of these podcasts.
[02:08:50] The physical one will help you across the board in all aspects of the game.
[02:08:55] So the way, maybe the best game.
[02:08:56] The game.
[02:08:57] The game straight up.
[02:08:59] In a way, the best way, the best strategy, you know, instead of pouring everything you
[02:09:03] have into your XYZ, whatever one thing you align them all and understand that they're
[02:09:07] all this, what it call it in business, vertically integrated and whatever.
[02:09:12] Right?
[02:09:13] Just called the path.
[02:09:14] The path.
[02:09:15] Yeah, same thing.
[02:09:16] So look, I'm going to exercise, be capable on duty, get to.
[02:09:18] I'm going to improve all my applicable skills.
[02:09:24] So I can be a better whatever those things are, whatever you are.
[02:09:28] You seem to have to know what you're going with.
[02:09:31] People should get supplements for more than you may.
[02:09:32] Is that what you're going with?
[02:09:33] I think I just saw little connection getting made.
[02:09:36] I'm going to make that connection in 20 minutes.
[02:09:41] I'm down.
[02:09:42] I'm down.
[02:09:43] See that kind of artistic maneuver.
[02:09:47] The intellectual sharpness as you bring it in for the big win and all of a sudden you're
[02:09:50] talking about how we're going to get some supplementation.
[02:09:53] I'm hype on that.
[02:09:55] But when we start going 12 minutes and we're talking about alignment and vertical integration,
[02:10:01] this is an important thing.
[02:10:02] Okay.
[02:10:03] I'll just say it.
[02:10:04] Now you did have one person respond on social media that they are listening.
[02:10:08] Right now.
[02:10:09] So that person is happy that you're going down the path of whatever you're going down.
[02:10:13] Hey, look.
[02:10:14] Which is fine.
[02:10:15] Oh, right.
[02:10:16] Well, hey, better to be over-inform then under-informed.
[02:10:18] Okay.
[02:10:19] So, hey, look data.
[02:10:20] I don't know if we can make that necessarily a blanket statement because I think
[02:10:24] the people that are right now are questioning.
[02:10:26] Well, I love this.
[02:10:27] I mean, in this scenario that we're in at this moment.
[02:10:29] Hey, thanks for helping it alone.
[02:10:30] Okay.
[02:10:31] You know, you're a little bump.
[02:10:32] Push.
[02:10:33] You do a great job.
[02:10:34] A little influence.
[02:10:35] A little influence.
[02:10:36] Anyway, all right.
[02:10:38] Cool.
[02:10:39] Where we're here trying to compete, stay competitive, improve, and maintain our competitive
[02:10:43] advantage.
[02:10:44] Okay.
[02:10:45] Look, we need supplementation.
[02:10:46] Yeah, quickly that worked.
[02:10:47] Yeah.
[02:10:48] I kind of set you up like, hey, how can we maintain competitiveness?
[02:10:50] You could sit boom and you were there.
[02:10:51] I know many things like my idea too.
[02:10:53] There wasn't a lot of money.
[02:10:54] I did.
[02:10:55] I didn't.
[02:10:56] The scene in my head and man, that was like, man, the best idea ever came up, seemingly.
[02:11:00] That was a good job.
[02:11:01] Yeah.
[02:11:02] Okay.
[02:11:03] So I'm taking discipline and discipline.
[02:11:06] Go, that's probably why my brain is so sharp.
[02:11:08] Let me say something.
[02:11:09] Let me say something.
[02:11:11] Because even as you're talking about this, people aren't thinking, okay, what
[02:11:14] does this all mean?
[02:11:16] Here's what, here's a bonus thing.
[02:11:18] Because we repeat a lot of the same stuff, right?
[02:11:20] Sure.
[02:11:21] We certainly seem to repeat.
[02:11:22] What are you writing now?
[02:11:23] Nothing.
[02:11:24] Just continue, please, with your thoughts.
[02:11:25] You're making notes.
[02:11:26] That's the indication of that.
[02:11:28] It's that.
[02:11:29] We added in stuff.
[02:11:30] Please, please continue.
[02:11:31] Are we having things?

[02:12:01] I guess I have to remember, I have such a stash of this that I forget.
[02:12:06] Geez.
[02:12:07] So, so I am, I am, I'm almost ashamed to say that.
[02:12:13] But the only one I don't have a huge stash of is Cold War.
[02:12:17] I think you said vitamin D, maybe that's what you were alluding to.
[02:12:21] What did I say?
[02:12:22] You said vitamin D.
[02:12:23] Yeah.
[02:12:24] I say Cold War.

[02:12:54] Maintain the competitive edge, joint warfare for your joints.
[02:12:57] Don't worry about that stuff.
[02:12:58] You don't have to worry about your joints anymore.
[02:13:00] Super cruel oil.
[02:13:01] Same deal.
[02:13:02] General health are other benefits, vitamin T3, and it is another one.
[02:13:05] Also cold war, this for immunity and other health benefits.
[02:13:10] Better to have health benefits than health.
[02:13:12] Deutch events.
[02:13:14] Okay.
[02:13:15] Okay.
[02:13:16] You're like, that's the threat, you're like, actually, you're here.
[02:13:19] So, you should release operations that I don't know what you're saying, and the you
[02:13:22] hold it off credit.
[02:13:23] Negative credit.
[02:13:24] Credit is in the you understand credit.
[02:13:26] Right.
[02:13:27] Anyway, back to the supplements, discipline.
[02:13:29] discipline go. So discipline the powder for your brain for your body
[02:13:33] discipline go, brain body just on the go quicker, delivery system, capsules, and
[02:13:38] also the energy drink form. It's a healthy energy drink by the way if we didn't
[02:13:41] already know, even though we do, that is those are the facts. Also, milk for extra
[02:13:46] protein form and dessert, super delicious tasting protein as a dessert. Yeah,
[02:13:51] you could say extra protein where you just say, oh, if you want also one of
[02:13:54] dessert, cool, you can get some milk. You get them at wall, you get the drinks,
[02:13:58] you can get the the ready to drink the cans at wall wall all the wall
[02:14:03] was by the way, they're in there and vitamin shop. So you can you can get them there
[02:14:09] or you can get them at origin main.com and if you get a subscription, there's a
[02:14:15] little issue with the wall us in area. What is it? I got a lot of videos of
[02:14:19] people just going in there and cleaning it out. So people going there with
[02:14:23] coolers, yeah, going to the shelves of wall and empty every can. So be
[02:14:28] born. Yeah, they're getting after people are getting after it. But the great
[02:14:33] great thing is we started off in Florida and it was sort of a test run for
[02:14:38] walla and everyone went after those. After those things, those and walla and
[02:14:45] just almost like less than a month into it, less than a month into a three
[02:14:50] month trial walla came to us and said, we want you know the stores. So thank
[02:14:55] you for for getting after it and walla was going to deliver walla was also in the
[02:15:01] game because they get tagged a lot from people out there shopping walla and
[02:15:04] they always get a good reply. Awesome. Interesting that yeah, I saw that with a guy
[02:15:08] with the cooler was like a bin and he was like boom, cool. I was like, let's
[02:15:13] interesting. I don't think I've ever been really that compelled to do that with
[02:15:16] it with the like a drink or whatever. I'm saying under what circumstances would I
[02:15:20] be? And then I thought back to it was like maybe like four days or so before
[02:15:25] it were I texted be little with the emergency scenario because I was only on my
[02:15:30] last one. Because I think they'll send it. They'll send it in and because usually
[02:15:34] I don't go to my last one. But what if I'm on my last one and I'm like, wait a
[02:15:39] second I can go to walla and restock. Then you're bringing a cooler. So it makes
[02:15:44] sense. Exactly. Right. That's one other good reason you got here on a
[02:15:47] subscription. That day doesn't come. That day does not come. And we don't want
[02:15:52] that day to come. So yes, you mentioned originate.com. That's where you can get it
[02:15:57] as well. Also an originamine.com. You can get you just to stuff gear, jegees,
[02:16:05] rashguards, against stuff also shirts and sweats and cool clothes as well. This
[02:16:10] is all American made stuff by the way. Big deal. Yeah, you just do competitive
[02:16:14] advantage. Yes, competitive advantage to have not slave labor but awesome
[02:16:20] people. Yeah, you you mentioned that like slave labor like when you kind of
[02:16:25] you know the front end of the slave labor situation, right? You could just be like,
[02:16:29] oh yeah, we'll just make it super cheap. You know, you guys make it and we can
[02:16:32] sell it for higher or whatever. But it's own cares about what they're doing on
[02:16:35] every step. You know, like manufacturer like, okay, my job is to do this and
[02:16:39] do this and to do this and I'm going to just do it. But I care about doing it.
[02:16:42] Brother, it's way better. Like quality wise in every capacity and sustainable.
[02:16:46] Yeah. So yes, that is a competitive advantage. What if everyone on your team
[02:16:50] cared about what their job was?
[02:16:52] Brother, that's all right. And so you just nailed that.
[02:16:56] Sure. I agree that that is the case.
[02:16:58] Unless back to how we can all support ourselves.
[02:17:02] Jocquad was a store called Jocquad store and this is where you can represent your
[02:17:07] apparel while you're on the path maintaining your advantage competitively.
[02:17:12] We have shirts and hoodies and hats. They all say disciplinicals freedom or
[02:17:16] something along those lines. Good. Good. Same thing in a way. Kind of part of this.
[02:17:23] Anyway, you understand what I'm saying?
[02:17:25] Good stuff on there. There's a T-shirt club called this shirt locker.
[02:17:28] S-H-U-S. Thank you to whoever made that suggestion.
[02:17:32] Yeah, that's a good one. It was a lot better than the other name that we had been
[02:17:36] using here. The thing is to be honest, like the more I think about it, the
[02:17:39] shirt locker is like it didn't even matter what the name was before.
[02:17:42] That one would probably be better because it's like perfect.
[02:17:45] That's the perfect name. The shirt locker.
[02:17:47] Yep. And that is also a subscription scenario where you can get kind of different types of shirts
[02:17:52] from us. A little not hardcore disciplinicals freedom stuff, but some fun stuff.
[02:17:58] It's cool. It's cool. It'll deal. So you look into that. That's for you.
[02:18:01] Do that.

[02:18:27] now about going into some other facets of these discussions.
[02:18:34] And and reason we're doing that. We don't. We need to have an alternative platform.
[02:18:39] And we don't want to take on sponsors where we have to say what they say us.
[02:18:45] Say what they tell us to say. And then also not say what they tell us not to say.
[02:18:53] We don't want to do that. We definitely don't want to have anyone critiquing how certain
[02:18:59] people on this podcast talk about the items that are discussed.
[02:19:06] Oh, David. Look at David. Look at the two.
[02:19:10] Hey, because eight dollars and 18 cents a month or you can even if you can't afford eight dollars
[02:19:15] and eight, you can send some of. But by the way, this is what supports this podcast.
[02:19:19] Two, but we don't want to have the jockel podcast behind a pay wall.
[02:19:25] I always say firewall and you like correcting me right before I even said it, which is good.
[02:19:29] Because I saw you right my mouth.
[02:19:31] Little and sink is at that. Yeah. Yeah. Let's sink. Yeah. Well, a firewall is an actual thing in
[02:19:36] like programming or something like that. Okay. Well, we just have a we don't want to put it
[02:19:39] behind a pay wall because we don't ever move over to here. And so that's why eight dollars and
[02:19:43] 18 cents a month. If you if you can't afford that, it's okay. Email assistance at jockel
