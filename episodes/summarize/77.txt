So you have the back shore party, you know the two guys there have the officer and a couple other guys Picking up the stakes put the stakes out and that's usually photographers the obbure way out ahead of everybody else Taking the back shore information so that when you come back and do your Degraphic chart, you know you can lay it out exactly then you have to do it leave or you pan I was a good talker for I know all this good, so which I hated you know because you had to man make Hand draw the maps your hand drawing that and those those those charts that you draw You're gonna present those are gonna get presented to you know the Navy and they're gonna use those charts to conduct this landing You know like we was on this one bolt one time and we saw these 60 guys they were they had 60s on a boat you know they had these Big metal containers at the rounds when we were lucky and it was a flex tube that went into the 60 and so Couple k bars later we walked off with a couple of those and they were fit perfect in the back of it Prec 70 seven backpack We could put them on held 500 rounds and you had the flex tube that went right into your 60 Yeah, to have a special feed tray for you know me know it's feed tray the The feed tray was right on the end of the flex tube so it's set right in their perfect They just hit our group And you know, that was a that was a bad day in dark city, but it you know It got hit really bad, but Managed to get to the shore and put some of the guys off and stuff and it was I think it was gonna be a Pincher movement where they came out for people because they dropped the other guys way off and there were three UDG guys on that Group and then there was three of us on the group that when we got hit and your main mission was gonna be demo if Yeah, We're figuring them out ourselves most of the time Yeah, well, I can see the difference from my first platoon or we didn't have anything and my second Platoon where we actually worked off of actually an actionable intel that we got it was like night and day I would do it's a whole different world and just like we talked about before we started this you know you got your fine You got your fix and then you got your finish and Exploitation of you know what I mean, but that we're the best in the world. and he came up to me with his map and asked me where he was You know and that kind of I went and that's the second lieutenant He's leading up Platoon or Squad of guys in you know that kind of you know him saying I just don't know I don't know my thought of that was is We were trained I had a barrel coordination of exactly where their round was gonna go but even regardless you always worked it in Doesn't it wasn't a It's gives me a point weapon like m14 You know, it was a it's an area weapon, but still you can get pretty accurate with that some of the bitch and you'd always walk you around Because what you know rounds with the chain off kid Hit a guy just as well as get him right squirons chest or something and I use canteen pouches and I carried five campy canteen pouches around my waist and I put a hundred rounds there and leave about a Ninch out of that got it Then when I food fired and I knew I was getting low I'd pop my lid open on my Canna had grab my thing of my 60 rounds snap men and dump them in and close it or The lid when it opened up had ridges on the side that would slide right in just dependent, you know so I'll take the desert of the mountains but those are the things You know you know I always say that I always talk about seeing my guys lined up to go out and Remoddy and their their home visa lined up and like if I wasn't going on the hop There's just like platoon is going out and I'd stand there Just I salute them like as they were leaving you know We've been going for like two hours right now just um I want to get one more question Some some people Listen to the podcast that want to go in the sealed teams and You know any sort of Thought on what they should be thinking about when they're trying to get in or trying to go fast me all the time You know I would say real simple stuff you know like hey do a bunch of pull ups push ups dips swim run and don't quit and You know we're coming in what we do is two guys to branch out to the right or left to get anybody from behind The rest one would go in one guy would turn around look that way and the guys that go in and that way they can shoot You know 180 you know me and nobody was down now if the hooch was covered and had foliage around it Then as we came in one of the guys and the left would go down lay down look behind the other guy'd be right here at the corner Yeah, some reason a lot of people ask me if you've ever worked with foreign troops Everyone want to kind of kind of want to know what we think of their countries and their troops, you know, and you know the brits and the Aussies You know the S.A.S. or top chill for the first year The only ones that went out with us on patrol okay I got to wake up at 430 you know when the insurgent is gonna come it's gonna come at 430 You got to work out at 830 or 5 or whatever time you know when the weakness might come so you can be ready for it That diet thing you just don't know this is what I'm saying so nonetheless any moment of weakness this is what you do you? So anyway we got our six-by and was heading out when over where the seawall guys were we won the drink with us, you know We had our sixies with stuff you never knew you know, so we get over there and go walking in their compound and everything all right boys get up Let's drink well, see we made them drink with this naked Because we were all naked so we're all sitting there drinking beers Nakedness M60s and booze a like where this is going Yeah, you guys had way much more fun and We were the only ones that went out with them You know, and it all started out with a couple of sask guys drinking the bar with a couple of our guys and Pupar paths and telling tall tales and you know drinking bears and shit and I think you know we have this exchange and it's been on going Yeah, and so you learned all that you know I mean all you learned what you had to have or your gear you had like we'd do Sort of cool stuff where there are 60s and yet to see where we needed to have the Floatation and stuff like that you know to me and it was pretty good actually when I went out to New Island We didn't even have the camp out there We had in Island itself the town there was a gas station and had about four or five Green little green trailers and that's where we stayed at Well the platoon before us that was there and stuff that that was Platoon those years gotten a lot of shit You know, so I mean you got his metal wand or stuff like that and actually my second trip over Had been in that platoon year on a mean and yeah, tell me some stories about they got a lot of shit Just you know the the EOD guys that we had nowadays in the sealed teams the guys that come in They they go through work up with a very awesome You can't you couldn't if someone normal person was watching they wouldn't be able to tell who's the OD and who's not in at least when you're in a Remoddy and that's what most of you guys are like but my EOD guys talking about not wanting to go over there My EOD guys they would they would put together briefs of like the latest The latest ID's that's been out there. It's a process because you can't just have like two guys saying hey We should get, um, you know, I don't know something earrings or something in another guy's Yeah, that's no one other story don't ask oh, so you made my point for me So paths were one of those ones where there was a lot of people saying we need a or we should have hats That would be cool and people were like Because it was just partly out of the waters up, but they you know and pissed us off for underwater demolition was like you know Devied TF you know That's what we do you know, I think I think we have a lot of good stuff on there, but Only way if you're gonna find out is to go to jockelstore.com and find out for yourself if you're in the mood get something like that Or get something that's on there and it will support the podcast also Good way to support yourself in your journey journey Are we doing journey or you've been doing it to see you know, I know, but I just I have mixed still my own thought It was still not comfortable. You know me we'd uh You know more about the urban stuff than I do because they never fought or but you know We'd hit who it is and stuff like that, but we never swept through uh we did one village one time But when you got setups guys dropping pamphlets in saying You know, we may be doing something this area You know all the good guys leave and stuff like that Nine months is a long time but still you know, but actually back in the day Civic bay was almost worse than Vietnam in Samaris because it was almost like the gangsters back in Chicago You had all these different gangs right after each other in shit and when you was walking down McSysai you almost had a look around the corner this if you know they were shooting at each other before you walk by and shit It was uh it was pretty Kind of like the wild wild west They would take a thin branch or stick you know real thin like just like when you're fishing you can feel a bite on the line They would take that and they would hold it kind of in the center and as we're moving slow They'd move at any time that thing Dept they had reached out and feel it like a lot of other times if you're going down a trail Which isn't a really good idea anyway, but you step over a log sometimes they'd put a pressure detonated stuff over that log if you're stepped on it You know exactly where the guy is gonna be and what you're gonna do whether it's a peel off or whether you're going to the right or left You know me getting out of the the fire zone whatever you know And they got that training and they're the ones that were the category for that set and Like my lab first platoon in 69 my whole platoon went through most of that before we deployed over So you get all that stuff we didn't get the fieldcraft portion of it, but they had some great really good Quick kill trails and stuff like that and that would encompass everything you know to me yet That we know not everybody had a camera and not everybody You know had a video can these guys got video cameras now they got helmet cams they got all the stuff I imagine that's what that's why they picked it The ninth infantry in Vietnam had ten metal avoners awarded to soldiers and Three sailors so they were working in conjunction very closely with the brown water navy Which again to pull a quote from the last time you were on Roger you were like saying that job as being brown water navy was just Vicious John Vicious John and General Westmoreland said that the ninth infantry division and the mobile rivering forces saved the Delta region from falling to the North Vietnamese Durned turn-tap that could have been I mean I didn't know wasn't on land with them Don't know where everything they did remember as the second class in and we got we were on the S the Ascarion Benoelle as Reconous in skies. It's more like a line than it is rope, but that stretches from the beach from a couple guys on the beach Called the beach party all the way out to a boat a small little rubber boat Well, yeah, and that was an IBS we hooked it to it's about 30 feet has knots where you know each Paris gonna be holding on to and you mark take the sounding then you as you went to the next sounding Which was 25 yards down the beach and on the beast had be holding up these Markers so that you could get yourself on them You'd be dipping doing down until you got to that point again, then you'd take your sounding Yeah, you know For two training was different, you know once you got in your gut out of Ask you to your cadre then you went to a platoon and you went through platoon turning two and that was still ran by some of the Coddbury Because we had our own training seven team one Team one training self-bent around that long, huh? I guess that's that's the reason Just like you know, you know well those guys were those guys did those guys actually never mind They would they did they but it wasn't that far To the were the other boats where they'd start getting hit and thinking God damn we're being shot at and Go back and forth or they would Put a B40 rocket then they'd be down here in a spider hole, but they'd have Like singing a post little and sticking up and as soon as the boat got right there They would hit the command thing rocker would go off and hit the boat everybody It opened up here and these guys would be giggling taken off you know what I mean? and they picked us up in the guy And was shooting as 50 and stuff, but what was really neat was then come these two jets Oh, and they naep on the whole beat That was that was kind of cool that's when I told you when I got back to the boat I said the screws that snake and warrior ship I can't even use your in a pair of UDTs Call booties Like what the ref walkers a little they're like a like Chuck Converse Chuck Taylor's yeah, but a little bit leaner No, It's uh you got to take each day at a time when you get there and if you finish that day Be real happy then get the next day and keep going on don't look ahead of what you got to do But it's like when I was a Second time as a bud structure as a master to arms you know not get all these guys in so You know, we didn't just be hanging down or shit to come up and stuff because there are a lot of leaches over there No big thing, but I mean you just you just learned you know like I said that panty holes. We flew over to Subiq Bay and Like I said that's where we were at that's like you went to Guam or Subiqo's our place Super Bay and then they would they would fly over to We had different deaths That we hadn't Vietnam like in the denying they had camped in Shaw and from the Nangied work up and around Fubai way quang three dug hall the northern part of the area and stuff you know We want that up always heard about this up where They wanted to get this one VCI and they ended up hitting like his His family or some member of his family and then when they went to the feet when they had the funeral They wouldn't got the guy that they wouldn't know I wouldn't on that there's a lot of things that happened and Like you say when you're in your platoon that's kind of your world and and and you know what's what it's like you were talking about It's weird how some of this stuff stays Because you're talking about walking around in UDT shorts and coral boots and on unfortunately UDT shorts I don't think guys, why don't I don't think they get it should do many more, but when I got the team one We absolutely got it should UDT shorts, and that's what that was our uniform Yeah, I think we're going up and went kept going and then three guys popped up out of the rice Tyken one they started shooting at us and we were shooting back, but a sea wolf was coming right over us and three rounds Right through the instrument panel on the sea wolf didn't hit anybody They turned like this and we got had a mini gun and just went It's good because it helps spread the word seems obvious but when you really think about it's not as obvious as you might think Because when you get that alert it's not just the whole podcast as we always kind of know it's like little excerpts you know a lot of times or a little bit more artistic excerpts He's through cobras in Vietnam in a second deployment But those guys those pilots Vietnam the helicopter pilots of Vietnam's they did not they knew they were going to take Throne's they just went in anyways, you know they were bad That was the same as our seawalls and black ponies because the seawalls especially were just unbelievable guys You know just They were just bad ass dudes man. and What you know you're talking about gear a little bit and what you carried And there's all these kind of myths about what guys were doing Birken the day and in in Vietnam a one of them's blue jeans like everyone more blue jeans or a lot a lot of guys War blue jeans, which kind of makes sense to me because they're tough, right? Why everybody else was just looking over the edge like this and didn't get your again and wasn't you didn't get real excited when you were chosen to be the The coxon you know how often would you guys make enemy contact when you guys go out on ambush because I had to be kind of like looking for a needle and a haystack right? So another patrol or another platoon going into that area then we'd let them know you know See the barn dance files and then like you said when we got to Doong yeah, like my first deployment to Iraq We got like I don't know like four or five fire fights, and And a couple good fire fights and shit, you know and just know the court of light coming up and everything We're all bearded and you know There's so much mortal learn I don't know half our class probably we're flunked just academically with what the guys got to know now I sort of got we're a frog band. so But we did want people to know they were going out there so we gotten to a Retridger truck and hidden the back to that until they got close to where the cashier was then we went out and dug it up and came back Just little things you know that was a need-off And I look over at the person that was going like our guest You know, maybe it was like a senior officer someone was gonna come or some intel person that was gonna go out and Hop with us and I'd look at the beginning of the EOD brief I probably been issued for I don't know Even out in town you guys with coral boots and the rule x-watch and stuff you know to mean you can pick out a team guy in the heart and then the fucking chopper came in There's only one of them so we all couldn't get on it We landed with two choppers, you know So me and another guy a radio man and a stoner guy myself stayed there where that chopper went long-tam wasn't too far away Come back and pick this up, you know my poop was a little tight tight on that It was it was good There was a couple of platoons that had a photographer with him that took a lot of pictures and she had new probably You probably seen them in the substance, you know We didn't the there's platoon as well for in Iraq there was platoon's it got in trouble That's one of the reasons why we didn't take pictures because there was platoons that had pictures That got exposed and got released and they were shooting their pictures. They were there great troops and you know, they loved coming down and working with us because we got contact and When they you know up there they look for things to see if what they could find they had two types of things We had a five man fighting patrol or a ten I mean a five man wrecky or a ten man fighting patrol
