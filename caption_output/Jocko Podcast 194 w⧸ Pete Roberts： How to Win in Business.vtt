00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56
This is jocoponcast number 194 with echo Charles and me jocobwillic good evening

2
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:08.56
here. Good evening

3
00:00:10.56 --> 00:00:12.56
As a leader

4
00:00:13.56 --> 00:00:16.06
You have to put others before yourself

5
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:22.88
And that starts at the beginning and it starts with everything that you do

6
00:00:22.88 --> 00:00:30.24
You have to let the men eat first. You have to make sure that they have the gear that they need

7
00:00:31.52 --> 00:00:34.48
You have to let them get rest before you do

8
00:00:36.52 --> 00:00:38.52
That's how it works

9
00:00:40.72 --> 00:00:47.26
You have to make sure that they have what they need to accomplish the mission and then on top of that

10
00:00:47.26 --> 00:00:56.26
You have to make sure that the mission aligns with the good of the troops

11
00:00:59.38 --> 00:01:07.42
This is hard for some people to understand but this applies to any organization the military a business a sports team

12
00:01:10.06 --> 00:01:11.58
And

13
00:01:11.58 --> 00:01:17.42
You have to make sure that the troops understand that there may be short term sacrifice

14
00:01:20.94 --> 00:01:25.10
There may even be the ultimate sacrifice in

15
00:01:27.10 --> 00:01:29.10
War

16
00:01:30.78 --> 00:01:33.90
Men may be killed for the cause

17
00:01:33.90 --> 00:01:39.74
But that cause must be just

18
00:01:41.58 --> 00:01:53.50
And that cause must even in death benefit those who may have to give that last full measure and that that may sound impossible actually

19
00:01:54.42 --> 00:01:58.38
Because how can anyone benefit from their own death and the answer?

20
00:01:58.38 --> 00:02:06.14
Is actually quite simple when military personnel risk their lives they do so to provide

21
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:10.18
Safety and security for their country

22
00:02:12.78 --> 00:02:16.26
The country where their families live

23
00:02:17.34 --> 00:02:21.58
And those individuals put their families above themselves and as a military leader

24
00:02:21.58 --> 00:02:31.38
If you do see that a mission does not ultimately lead to the safety and security of the families of the people that you do lead then it's your obligation

25
00:02:32.26 --> 00:02:35.18
To raise this up the chain of command and fix it

26
00:02:38.62 --> 00:02:42.02
Then the same thing holds true in business as a leader

27
00:02:42.34 --> 00:02:46.22
You must put the good of the troops above yourself

28
00:02:46.22 --> 00:02:52.06
Now the thing that might seem impossible here

29
00:02:53.34 --> 00:02:59.82
Is that the overarching measurement of the success of a business is to be profitable

30
00:03:02.62 --> 00:03:03.62
And

31
00:03:03.62 --> 00:03:08.70
To maximize profit one of the things that you do is you cut costs and

32
00:03:09.50 --> 00:03:10.70
One of the

33
00:03:10.70 --> 00:03:15.78
easiest places to cut costs in any business is people you

34
00:03:20.10 --> 00:03:23.90
Minimize what you're paying people or you get rid of people and then

35
00:03:25.02 --> 00:03:27.02
You maximize profit

36
00:03:28.10 --> 00:03:38.34
So how can this leadership principle work how can you take care of people while at the same time maximizing profitability and the answer is that you have to look at the long game

37
00:03:38.34 --> 00:03:50.34
You have to see that the stronger you build a business the more long-term stability you build and the more long-term stability build the more stability you build for your employees

38
00:03:54.10 --> 00:04:00.42
And when you're stable that allows you to grow and when you grow your business the employees have the opportunity for growth

39
00:04:02.10 --> 00:04:04.10
And those opportunities

40
00:04:04.10 --> 00:04:11.14
Improve the lives for everyone for the employees for their family and thereby the whole community

41
00:04:12.10 --> 00:04:14.10
That's what happens

42
00:04:17.14 --> 00:04:20.66
But then what happens when leaders that don't put their people first

43
00:04:23.94 --> 00:04:25.94
In the military

44
00:04:26.26 --> 00:04:28.26
it can result in

45
00:04:28.26 --> 00:04:34.10
Operations going wrong it can result in senseless strategies and

46
00:04:35.22 --> 00:04:39.50
In the military it can result in wasted lives and

47
00:04:43.14 --> 00:04:45.14
In business you can see

48
00:04:45.94 --> 00:04:52.26
Another kind of destruction in business. It can mean loss of growth for sure the can mean loss of revenue yes

49
00:04:52.26 --> 00:04:54.26
It can mean loss of jobs

50
00:04:54.26 --> 00:04:57.22
But eventually it can mean the collapsing of

51
00:04:59.30 --> 00:05:01.30
Communities the collapsing of

52
00:05:02.18 --> 00:05:04.18
cultures

53
00:05:06.34 --> 00:05:11.38
Now of course a balance has to be found and profitability must be maintained

54
00:05:14.98 --> 00:05:19.06
But the dollar must not trump the people and

55
00:05:19.06 --> 00:05:22.50
It certainly must not

56
00:05:23.94 --> 00:05:25.94
Regardless of your

57
00:05:26.34 --> 00:05:28.34
Capitalistic goals

58
00:05:28.90 --> 00:05:34.50
The dollar must not trump the communities that built the businesses in the first place

59
00:05:37.06 --> 00:05:42.74
The pursuit of money must not jeopardize the very fabric of the country

60
00:05:42.74 --> 00:05:49.38
That gives us the promise for the unhindered pursuit of that money in the first place

61
00:05:54.18 --> 00:05:56.02
And yet we've seen that take place

62
00:05:57.62 --> 00:06:00.50
We've seen that take place in our own country

63
00:06:02.50 --> 00:06:06.50
In cities and in towns and in states where

64
00:06:07.78 --> 00:06:09.78
Saving a dollar

65
00:06:09.78 --> 00:06:12.98
Man closing a mill and

66
00:06:13.94 --> 00:06:15.94
Man shutting down a factory

67
00:06:17.78 --> 00:06:22.34
In places where making more money in the next financial quarter

68
00:06:23.38 --> 00:06:26.98
Caused leadership to forget the long-term impact

69
00:06:28.98 --> 00:06:34.10
And sell the future of those people for cash in hand in the immediate

70
00:06:34.10 --> 00:06:36.10
And

71
00:06:39.54 --> 00:06:41.54
That

72
00:06:41.54 --> 00:06:45.70
Disease that plague of greed can spread

73
00:06:49.78 --> 00:06:51.78
And it has hurt

74
00:06:51.78 --> 00:06:55.30
various parts of America at various times

75
00:06:57.54 --> 00:07:02.50
And when that's happening while the people at the top might build themselves

76
00:07:02.50 --> 00:07:05.22
A fortune it's a fortune built

77
00:07:06.50 --> 00:07:10.58
On despair and it's a fortune built on destruction and in the end

78
00:07:13.46 --> 00:07:15.46
That will come back to hunt them

79
00:07:17.78 --> 00:07:21.30
Because it is not the right thing to do

80
00:07:24.34 --> 00:07:26.34
Then it does not have to be that way

81
00:07:26.34 --> 00:07:28.34
Because

82
00:07:29.54 --> 00:07:42.26
Because there are leaders who recognize the long-term positive impact of growth and the long-term positive impact of putting your people first

83
00:07:48.10 --> 00:07:50.10
Putting your community first

84
00:07:50.10 --> 00:07:56.18
Putting your country first

85
00:08:00.50 --> 00:08:02.50
And one of those leaders

86
00:08:04.42 --> 00:08:08.74
Happens to be a business partner of mine happens to be a friend of mine

87
00:08:09.86 --> 00:08:16.50
And his name is Pete Roberts the founder of or gin us a and once again

88
00:08:16.50 --> 00:08:23.46
We are in the woods in the foothills of mains western mountains

89
00:08:24.82 --> 00:08:27.30
For our jiu jitsu immersion camp

90
00:08:27.86 --> 00:08:31.38
Which means it's time for us to record a podcast and if you don't know Pete

91
00:08:31.70 --> 00:08:39.14
Then go back and listen to podcast 93 and then listen to podcast 141 and then you can rejoin us here

92
00:08:39.62 --> 00:08:41.62
Because once again, we have Pete

93
00:08:42.26 --> 00:08:44.74
Roberts on the podcast Pete

94
00:08:44.74 --> 00:08:50.02
Welcome back. Thanks for having me. That was powerful. I was just you know you get into that rhythm

95
00:08:50.02 --> 00:08:54.34
And I'm just my head's good. I just catch myself going up and down like shit the way you captured

96
00:08:55.06 --> 00:08:57.06
What you just said is I

97
00:08:57.46 --> 00:08:59.94
Try to say the same thing. I say it differently, but

98
00:09:00.50 --> 00:09:02.50
Man, the impact

99
00:09:02.98 --> 00:09:05.46
You know and how important community is

100
00:09:05.46 --> 00:09:10.02
I know how important it was to new England towns, but it's not just new England towns. It's

101
00:09:10.98 --> 00:09:12.02
All towns

102
00:09:12.02 --> 00:09:14.02
all people and

103
00:09:14.02 --> 00:09:16.66
Man, you're absolutely right. Well with the

104
00:09:17.54 --> 00:09:20.02
With the standard that we're holding it or the

105
00:09:21.14 --> 00:09:23.38
The standard is made in America, right?

106
00:09:24.26 --> 00:09:30.34
We see every single day every single day a corner that could be cut we could make a compromise

107
00:09:30.82 --> 00:09:36.02
And you know what the profit margins would increase. Yep the profit margins would increase a little bit

108
00:09:36.98 --> 00:09:38.98
And and every day

109
00:09:38.98 --> 00:09:45.54
You and I get to see that and you're in it you know you're here you get to see it you know five times a day

110
00:09:45.70 --> 00:09:51.06
Eight times a day you see a decision that could be made you know what hey we could just get this thing instead

111
00:09:52.18 --> 00:09:56.58
And the profit margins go up a little bit and every day you hold the line

112
00:09:57.30 --> 00:10:02.50
Yeah, and I think if you you know like this statement I like to make is well if you if you follow the truck

113
00:10:02.50 --> 00:10:07.06
Back to the source you're gonna end up in a cotton field in the Tennessee Delta region

114
00:10:07.06 --> 00:10:13.70
So if you that that's your standard the supply chain is between here and there like like you said like oh yeah

115
00:10:13.70 --> 00:10:19.70
We could it like building the boots or the jeans a little buttons little brass buttons the leather tags all these things

116
00:10:20.34 --> 00:10:22.74
If you follow that supply chain back

117
00:10:23.14 --> 00:10:29.62
You're touching not just your local community but the thousands and thousands of hands and all the communities in between

118
00:10:30.10 --> 00:10:33.86
That supply chain and I think that's the easiest place

119
00:10:33.86 --> 00:10:41.14
That you could get rid of some of that but it's also the most important if it if you're truly doing something more than

120
00:10:42.02 --> 00:10:46.98
Trying to try to earn your weight at the top right and I think that

121
00:10:48.18 --> 00:10:54.82
In the past you know we thought we've discussed this you know in depth and the past you know and you look at all the free trade agreements on that stuff whatever

122
00:10:54.82 --> 00:10:56.82
Whatever, you know a side you're on on that thing

123
00:10:56.82 --> 00:11:02.10
It was greed it was greed and

124
00:11:05.30 --> 00:11:07.30
The people do the work

125
00:11:07.70 --> 00:11:12.66
You know yeah, there's mines at the top, you know and there's mines crunching numbers and designing stuff

126
00:11:12.66 --> 00:11:14.18
But the people do the work

127
00:11:15.22 --> 00:11:20.74
You know in the beautiful thing that we're doing is we're we're resurrecting

128
00:11:22.02 --> 00:11:24.66
That heritage and I'll tell you what

129
00:11:24.66 --> 00:11:27.70
I mean we've been together now one three years

130
00:11:27.86 --> 00:11:29.86
I think it's been about three years and

131
00:11:30.34 --> 00:11:33.86
Going from I don't know what we started out like what 10 people

132
00:11:34.58 --> 00:11:41.22
I think it was eight people when I when when I came when we merged it was eight people so maybe last year

133
00:11:41.22 --> 00:11:43.22
We had 25 people

134
00:11:43.86 --> 00:11:47.38
There's 50 people now in the factory 50 people

135
00:11:48.26 --> 00:11:52.50
Yeah, you know the and I was telling kind of the crew this the other day when we gave the tour

136
00:11:52.50 --> 00:11:57.78
You know, I'm sitting here saying this stuff right and and I'm talking about being greedy and

137
00:11:58.90 --> 00:12:01.22
Immediately if you go okay, well this guy's not greedy

138
00:12:02.50 --> 00:12:09.62
There's like a there's like a point where you say okay, well, what does he believe it and I actually in my mind I was thinking that because here I am talking about hey you can't be greedy

139
00:12:10.02 --> 00:12:12.02
And then I said listen I am

140
00:12:12.34 --> 00:12:14.34
I am an absolute

141
00:12:14.34 --> 00:12:17.38
Hard core capitalist and I

142
00:12:17.78 --> 00:12:18.58
Love

143
00:12:18.58 --> 00:12:21.30
Deal-make I mean you you get to see me now because we do business

144
00:12:21.30 --> 00:12:24.02
You know, I mean I love making deals. I love making things happen

145
00:12:24.74 --> 00:12:26.66
I love making money like it's great

146
00:12:26.90 --> 00:12:32.10
It's it's it's a it's a it's a great contest. It's a great way to keep score. You know, it's it's fun

147
00:12:32.66 --> 00:12:35.86
Right and I'm absolutely a capitalist but

148
00:12:36.50 --> 00:12:39.54
There's such an easy line to draw so I don't even think it's that hard to draw

149
00:12:39.54 --> 00:12:43.46
It's not like it's the wood's hard decision to make and oh, I don't know what I should do it's like no

150
00:12:44.18 --> 00:12:48.82
You you make money, but you do the right thing and you make sure that you're taking care of people

151
00:12:48.82 --> 00:12:54.66
You're making the right decisions and that's what you do and this is the the cool thing about it

152
00:12:54.66 --> 00:12:57.14
And this is where people make them a sake is in the long run

153
00:12:57.70 --> 00:13:01.46
In the long run you'll do better. It's just like leadership just like leadership

154
00:13:01.94 --> 00:13:03.54
If you're taking care of your people

155
00:13:03.70 --> 00:13:09.70
In the long run they're gonna take care of you and that's gonna be the long-term victory is gonna be better

156
00:13:10.10 --> 00:13:15.22
Then looking for the short term. Hey, I bark it if you work for me and I bark at you and you go and do it right now

157
00:13:15.22 --> 00:13:16.50
Because you don't want to get in trouble

158
00:13:16.50 --> 00:13:19.70
But you're looking for another job even though I got you to do what I want you to do

159
00:13:19.86 --> 00:13:25.94
It doesn't matter long-term. I'm gonna lose and when I'm taking investment away from the people that actually support the community

160
00:13:26.34 --> 00:13:31.54
Where we are then that's just a bad decision in the long run and again short term it looks might look great

161
00:13:32.10 --> 00:13:36.74
Yeah long-term. What does it look like? It's a bad deal. It's a bad deal for the community

162
00:13:36.74 --> 00:13:42.02
Which makes the bad deal for the country and if the if our countries have it hard time? Well guess what what if we got?

163
00:13:42.02 --> 00:13:47.38
100% you've got abandoned mills and factories falling apart in these towns

164
00:13:48.02 --> 00:13:54.02
100% so you just talked about growth. What do what have you seen from a leadership perspective?

165
00:13:54.50 --> 00:13:57.78
You've doubled inside and in size and

166
00:13:58.90 --> 00:14:04.18
I know I said to you the other day as it hey Pete it's gonna get to a point where you're not gonna be able to really

167
00:14:05.22 --> 00:14:10.42
You know when you got 20 people we got eight people clearly you you I mean personal relationship

168
00:14:10.42 --> 00:14:16.66
You want families are eight people right exactly when you got 25 people well now we're talking cousins and uncles and aunts

169
00:14:16.66 --> 00:14:21.94
Maybe you don't know all of them that well and there's probably that one weird you know couple you've recruited all you can

170
00:14:21.94 --> 00:14:25.30
Yeah, yeah like you're there and now when you get to 50 people

171
00:14:25.86 --> 00:14:30.50
Well there's people that you know you're you're just you're just not sure and and you don't seem every day because you're busy

172
00:14:30.50 --> 00:14:34.98
They're busy they're working you're working so you start to you start to rely on

173
00:14:35.94 --> 00:14:38.58
You're trying to rely up more on your

174
00:14:38.58 --> 00:14:43.78
Leadership team to carry the message through the company. How's that been for you?

175
00:14:45.38 --> 00:14:48.98
Honestly, I'll tell you and I don't want it. This just sound like

176
00:14:49.86 --> 00:14:54.74
You know, oh this is this is the the only thing you should go by but

177
00:14:55.70 --> 00:14:57.70
When we did it when we like

178
00:14:58.58 --> 00:15:03.78
When I pushed extreme ownership I had a stack of books and all my leadership and anybody else interested

179
00:15:03.78 --> 00:15:10.26
I didn't just hold it to the leadership about anyone interested in being part of this company longterm

180
00:15:11.62 --> 00:15:17.30
I want you to read this book. I'd recommend you read this book and I had people say well I I don't read

181
00:15:17.70 --> 00:15:23.14
And I'd like cool. I'll pay for I'll pay for yeah, I'll give you cash download it and

182
00:15:23.78 --> 00:15:29.38
You know and it's like well I don't have time. Oh, we'll put the headphones on while you're sewing you know download it

183
00:15:29.38 --> 00:15:31.38
You know and I got I got you so

184
00:15:31.38 --> 00:15:33.38
That

185
00:15:33.62 --> 00:15:35.62
changed a lot

186
00:15:36.42 --> 00:15:41.14
A change it changed me a lot and we've talked about this in the past but the biggest thing is

187
00:15:41.70 --> 00:15:46.10
How important for me decentralized command was the decentralized command

188
00:15:47.78 --> 00:15:54.18
And decentralized command and the biggest part of that was I was telling you this the other day like

189
00:15:54.58 --> 00:16:00.74
70 100 what do I mean well you've got allow people and empower people and your leaders to make

190
00:16:00.74 --> 00:16:06.58
Decisions right and if you can get them to a 70% decision which I learned at the monster also

191
00:16:06.74 --> 00:16:08.74
You know and I took if you can get them there

192
00:16:08.90 --> 00:16:16.18
Man, that's that's a great thing. It's a great example. We're sitting here in this pro shop at the immersion camp to get everything here

193
00:16:16.42 --> 00:16:18.42
It took it took

194
00:16:18.42 --> 00:16:27.62
5 or 6 trucks and I'm talking a 26 foot you haul an 18 foot trailer another 24 foot trailer and it took a team of 20 people to get everything here

195
00:16:27.62 --> 00:16:30.82
Yeah, and I took my wife Amanda to the

196
00:16:31.70 --> 00:16:35.46
The monster and DC and my father on La Jo and

197
00:16:36.42 --> 00:16:41.38
Brian our business partner came and his wife Megan and and we went through it and

198
00:16:42.18 --> 00:16:43.78
When you discussed this

199
00:16:43.78 --> 00:16:48.02
Does it always have to be a hundred percent like I feel like I'm gonna make a hundred percent decision

200
00:16:48.02 --> 00:16:53.94
Maybe that's a little bit of ego talking, you know, but I feel like my decision is always gonna be a hundred percent right

201
00:16:53.94 --> 00:17:00.74
Yeah, and I thought that it was too too dangerous to allow anything less

202
00:17:01.30 --> 00:17:03.30
So what I used to do is I used to

203
00:17:04.50 --> 00:17:06.50
Flank people to buy into my idea

204
00:17:07.14 --> 00:17:10.98
You know to me like a flank of the buy into my idea until they until they could see it

205
00:17:10.98 --> 00:17:14.18
But I had to get them to see it to buy in and now

206
00:17:15.22 --> 00:17:19.86
It's it's different and it's like setting up this pro shop. I know we were it was early in the morning

207
00:17:19.86 --> 00:17:25.14
And we just like man your teams your teams going early right and I was like yeah, they were up at five getting everything set up

208
00:17:26.02 --> 00:17:30.42
And I was like, but I'm not there right now. I'm I'm hanging back. There's a few things I got to do here

209
00:17:31.14 --> 00:17:37.30
To prep and a man is handling it my wife is handling it and I'm like it's the 70 hundred and you're like

210
00:17:37.70 --> 00:17:40.02
What do you mean I'm like you know the 70 percent hundred you're like

211
00:17:40.42 --> 00:17:42.42
Shack

212
00:17:42.90 --> 00:17:49.30
She she called me to hours later. We're good to go. Yeah, I was like I don't think I could have gotten that done in two hours

213
00:17:49.30 --> 00:17:55.46
My hundred percent. I don't think I would have gotten it done in two hours. It maybe would have been another 70 percent

214
00:17:55.46 --> 00:18:02.42
Maybe it would have been 65 maybe it would have been maybe it would have been 80 maybe it would have been an 82 the bottom line any of that discussion

215
00:18:02.66 --> 00:18:03.86
argument

216
00:18:03.86 --> 00:18:06.90
You know planning would have just wasted

217
00:18:07.22 --> 00:18:11.14
Valuable time on both ends. Yep, and but we did do that

218
00:18:11.70 --> 00:18:15.06
We did because I it was the night before I was like

219
00:18:15.06 --> 00:18:23.38
But can you see logistically that coming into this camp in the woods you can't get four trucks in

220
00:18:23.94 --> 00:18:28.58
I'm like you got to be able to see that you need to it this needs to happen methodically

221
00:18:28.82 --> 00:18:32.74
You know, so as this one's unloading and leaving the next one's coming in

222
00:18:33.30 --> 00:18:38.18
So you're saying you did waste time discussing I did I did and then you let it go and then I said go

223
00:18:39.06 --> 00:18:41.94
Yeah, I said I think you've got a good plan. I think that's gonna work

224
00:18:41.94 --> 00:18:45.38
Let me know what you need and I got behind supporting the plan

225
00:18:46.98 --> 00:18:51.78
That's the way that's yeah, so there's a great example of decentralized current and so that's now what you've had to do

226
00:18:52.50 --> 00:18:57.06
with everything and because you can't manage it all because

227
00:18:57.70 --> 00:19:01.46
This is you know we work with that. I saw in front we work with all different companies

228
00:19:01.46 --> 00:19:06.90
But obviously work with startup companies and we see this kind of growth and these are the kind of things that trip them up

229
00:19:06.90 --> 00:19:12.82
They get the guy who's a visionary like you're the big visionary and then you start saying well

230
00:19:12.82 --> 00:19:16.10
I can you know I started this thing when I started this thing I was making every decision and now

231
00:19:16.10 --> 00:19:19.86
I was suddenly look up and if you were trying to make every single decision that was going on the factory

232
00:19:20.02 --> 00:19:22.34
It would be a total disaster oh

233
00:19:22.90 --> 00:19:24.90
1000 percent

234
00:19:26.02 --> 00:19:29.94
What what has necessitated the

235
00:19:29.94 --> 00:19:36.42
The doubling and size this year and it's not just a doubling in people because when you get people what else you need you need space

236
00:19:36.66 --> 00:19:39.86
Yeah, so we got two more buildings. Yeah

237
00:19:40.26 --> 00:19:46.18
Man the new the origin labs facility at the warehouse now. This is super challenged dude

238
00:19:46.74 --> 00:19:52.58
We I don't know if you know remember on the Instagram. I don't know if you saw that echo like all the sudden it was flooded

239
00:19:53.14 --> 00:19:56.26
You know and we had this spray foam because you know this isn't a

240
00:19:56.26 --> 00:20:00.74
Extreme environment right extreme hot and extreme cold during the winter

241
00:20:01.22 --> 00:20:06.90
But we're trying to get everything into the warehouse. It's not insulated. We got to get a heating system in and

242
00:20:07.54 --> 00:20:12.18
You know it's just one of those things where you just grind and grind and grind but we mean to go

243
00:20:12.18 --> 00:20:17.70
Shaded a great deal on that property and the next property is gonna allow us to expand a little more

244
00:20:18.82 --> 00:20:20.82
You know and I think

245
00:20:20.82 --> 00:20:22.82
I think that

246
00:20:22.82 --> 00:20:26.98
I think we're gonna have some challenges ahead of us because we've

247
00:20:27.86 --> 00:20:34.34
Expanded the three locations, but we've almost created a bermuted triangle of sorts the way that we

248
00:20:35.38 --> 00:20:38.90
Secured the locations the facilities it's efficient

249
00:20:38.98 --> 00:20:42.66
It's like lean manufacturing of you know in between the factories

250
00:20:42.98 --> 00:20:46.98
You know the way you can get from you know one point to the next to maximize

251
00:20:47.62 --> 00:20:49.62
Maximizer time, but

252
00:20:49.62 --> 00:20:53.94
You know the lab's facility is awesome and why we fulfill them

253
00:20:54.82 --> 00:21:03.86
500 to 1000 packages a day out of there for filling yeah all leaned out from a shipping perspective yeah and in the next facility which

254
00:21:05.38 --> 00:21:07.78
We'll be moving into what next week

255
00:21:09.54 --> 00:21:12.66
Next week you want to hang out and move some of those machines for those where's our girl

256
00:21:12.66 --> 00:21:14.66
Our favorite fat ass

257
00:21:14.66 --> 00:21:20.18
Where all the the shoe manufacturing machinery will be going and the screen printing and some raw

258
00:21:20.18 --> 00:21:22.18
Robert materials so

259
00:21:22.42 --> 00:21:28.42
22,000 square feet there 17,000 square feet and labs and of course we're chewed up 21,000 square feet currently so

260
00:21:28.98 --> 00:21:33.14
Growing quickly and yeah leadership has been essential

261
00:21:33.70 --> 00:21:41.54
And decentralized command essential in that growth and impossible without it and seeing your and I noticed this from early

262
00:21:41.54 --> 00:21:45.62
You know I'd come up and someone to pull me aside and say hey you know in chapter four

263
00:21:45.62 --> 00:21:50.74
You're talking about this you know and they'd ask me questions yeah and I'd just be it was such a

264
00:21:51.38 --> 00:21:52.90
Great sign

265
00:21:52.90 --> 00:21:55.30
Because when people don't recognize

266
00:21:55.54 --> 00:21:58.18
How important their job is and how important they are as a leader

267
00:21:59.06 --> 00:22:01.22
That's not that's just this is not gonna work

268
00:22:01.22 --> 00:22:08.74
But when someone realizes that they're having a huge impact with every part of their department and that their leadership is the most important thing in that department

269
00:22:08.74 --> 00:22:12.66
When they realize that and they start taking ownership of it

270
00:22:13.54 --> 00:22:20.26
That has an impact and that's what it was good for and I saw that early on I saw that early on you know we did like a little

271
00:22:20.90 --> 00:22:22.90
Little session and

272
00:22:23.06 --> 00:22:25.38
But and people were asking me questions during the session

273
00:22:25.78 --> 00:22:30.10
But afterwards you know people coming up hey I want to want to ask this in front of everyone

274
00:22:30.10 --> 00:22:35.94
But what do you think about this how should I handle that and so the people are aware and that's I think that's one of the things that

275
00:22:35.94 --> 00:22:42.18
Has I'm not saying there's not growing pains because I mean of course there's growing pains but most of the growing pains are are like

276
00:22:43.54 --> 00:22:49.62
Almost like physical growing pains sure you know like when you're when you're sun grows four inches in six months and he's

277
00:22:49.62 --> 00:22:56.10
Says you know hey my knees kind of hurt. Yeah, that's just a physical. Yes. It's gonna hurt. You're growing sorry dude

278
00:22:56.66 --> 00:23:05.14
But as far as you know the psychological trauma of all the you know brain damage about this and that the other thing is very limited right now

279
00:23:05.14 --> 00:23:13.38
Which is amazing to see yeah, it is and you we're talking about people who weren't leaders prior to

280
00:23:14.18 --> 00:23:19.38
Origin you know nobody had a leadership position nobody had a management position

281
00:23:20.02 --> 00:23:23.06
You know and the the leaders that we've built

282
00:23:24.18 --> 00:23:26.58
There they're not entitled to it

283
00:23:26.98 --> 00:23:33.70
You know it's it's weird because you you got people who go through let's say they go to college to be you know business management or leadership

284
00:23:33.70 --> 00:23:35.70
Whatever

285
00:23:35.62 --> 00:23:40.26
There's so much potential and people who just want to work and be part of something

286
00:23:40.34 --> 00:23:45.30
There's so they find so much motivation in that I would rather have someone and

287
00:23:45.54 --> 00:23:48.58
When I do like job interviews I say hey like one of the first questions

288
00:23:48.58 --> 00:23:54.74
Are you looking for a job or are you looking for a career and that's kind of a loaded question right when I hear I'm looking for a career

289
00:23:55.94 --> 00:24:02.98
Okay, we're gonna dig deeper into this conversation now. I'd rather take someone who's looking for a career

290
00:24:02.98 --> 00:24:04.98
that

291
00:24:04.98 --> 00:24:09.94
Has no leadership skills and give them the opportunity because I know long-term

292
00:24:10.42 --> 00:24:15.70
They're gonna be an incredible asset the other company. That's the same theory that we have with EF overwatch

293
00:24:15.70 --> 00:24:21.54
With with hiring vets were bringing vets in look a veteran might not have worked in whatever industry you're in

294
00:24:21.62 --> 00:24:26.10
But that person is hungry they got leadership skills and they got discipline

295
00:24:26.50 --> 00:24:31.78
They end especially the group that we got we got they they study and trained in extreme ownership and the principles

296
00:24:31.78 --> 00:24:33.78
So they they know how to lead and

297
00:24:34.74 --> 00:24:39.22
We're getting the feedback that we're getting is phenomenal because people hire somebody and they go

298
00:24:39.54 --> 00:24:43.38
What they you know they feel like they're taking a little bit of a risk because the person it's you know

299
00:24:43.38 --> 00:24:46.18
It's this person that was in the in the army for

300
00:24:46.66 --> 00:24:54.34
21 years or this person who's been in the whatever industry the the the gas oil industry for 21 years and you think well

301
00:24:54.98 --> 00:25:00.10
We should probably just hire the guy that kind of has experience and we're finding over and over and over again

302
00:25:00.10 --> 00:25:04.26
They guess what you take that person that's really hungry that has good leadership skills

303
00:25:04.58 --> 00:25:11.30
They step into that role they learn the this industry specific stuff and they and they rock and roll and I tell

304
00:25:11.62 --> 00:25:18.42
I tell kids this all the time not not kids, but you know college kids college graduates college graduates

305
00:25:18.42 --> 00:25:22.26
If you're that person that will work hard

306
00:25:23.14 --> 00:25:26.90
You can there's so many companies because I work with so many companies

307
00:25:26.90 --> 00:25:33.14
They there's a drought of people no ones like hey, yep, we got all the good. I've never I have never

308
00:25:33.54 --> 00:25:37.22
Been to a company where they said yep, we got all the good people we need we don't need anyone else

309
00:25:37.22 --> 00:25:41.78
We don't need anyone other good people. I've never heard anyone say anything close to that ever

310
00:25:42.34 --> 00:25:47.54
Even companies where you know people are banging on the door to get in big tech companies that have

311
00:25:47.78 --> 00:25:50.26
That have popcorn machines in the hallways

312
00:25:50.26 --> 00:25:52.98
Open button. I want to work there, right?

313
00:25:52.98 --> 00:26:00.18
There's people banging on the door to get there. You know those big tech companies say they say how do you think we could get better people?

314
00:26:00.18 --> 00:26:02.18
That are willing to go hard

315
00:26:02.82 --> 00:26:07.38
So it's exactly what you're saying if you if you look for someone if you look for somebody

316
00:26:07.38 --> 00:26:10.50
That has that hunger and has that desire and then they actually have to have it

317
00:26:11.06 --> 00:26:14.74
Because believe me there's people like an interview great and say who you love to grind?

318
00:26:14.82 --> 00:26:18.82
What's your biggest weakness my biggest weakness is sometimes I work too hard, right?

319
00:26:18.82 --> 00:26:23.78
That person and then you show up and they're they're in the freaking Twinkie stash

320
00:26:24.34 --> 00:26:27.62
So I'm not talking about people yeah, I sometimes I get in the Twinkies that

321
00:26:28.98 --> 00:26:32.58
I saw you getting in the donut stash today bro. Are you okay?

322
00:26:33.38 --> 00:26:35.38
I'm there and I'm good now

323
00:26:35.38 --> 00:26:39.54
You had like insulin spike your face was kind of sagging

324
00:26:39.54 --> 00:26:41.06
Swagging away

325
00:26:41.06 --> 00:26:46.58
I was like I'm gonna go lay down. Yeah, I mean I can't literally never eat a donut again

326
00:26:46.58 --> 00:26:52.42
If I do I always think there's gonna be someone with a with an iPhone over there in the corner and that's gonna be the viral

327
00:26:52.42 --> 00:26:55.86
The only viral video of jockel won't be something that echo made

328
00:26:57.22 --> 00:26:59.22
You need me the donut

329
00:26:59.86 --> 00:27:02.82
Maybe my video eating a donut that would be a

330
00:27:03.38 --> 00:27:12.02
That would be a major kind of situation that we'd have to discuss yes like trees in us. Yeah, yeah, that would be I've I haven't been betrayed very much

331
00:27:12.74 --> 00:27:14.74
In fact, I've only been betrayed one time

332
00:27:14.74 --> 00:27:17.62
But if that I would consider that

333
00:27:18.18 --> 00:27:22.10
We'd have to we'd have to put that in that mean number that would be a consideration of the trail

334
00:27:22.10 --> 00:27:25.30
Yeah, I don't think I would do but don't worry. Don't forget where I'm out of you. No, that's

335
00:27:25.78 --> 00:27:27.78
The duet of a bottle of all the other things. Yes

336
00:27:28.34 --> 00:27:34.34
How many pieces two pieces? That's good start. How many did you feed me? Oh, dude. I would just kept shoveling your busy

337
00:27:34.66 --> 00:27:38.26
I don't think you even know you're thinking what is what is like the sweet

338
00:27:38.74 --> 00:27:42.42
Like part they're the the moist like they're really like almost wet part

339
00:27:42.42 --> 00:27:46.26
That's like the the honey okay sugar syrup

340
00:27:46.98 --> 00:27:50.90
But you know that's a special recipe. Yeah, you know we were we when we were

341
00:27:51.46 --> 00:27:56.50
We went to Harry's Dine we were in New York City and Harry's steak house. We're eating with Harry in there

342
00:27:57.78 --> 00:27:59.78
We sent him buckle of a

343
00:27:59.78 --> 00:28:04.66
In my mom she she called me and she's like you sent buckle of a

344
00:28:05.22 --> 00:28:09.70
To New York City to a guy who wants a big restaurant. Oh, yeah, she goes you didn't send the recipe did you

345
00:28:09.70 --> 00:28:14.90
And I was like no no, I just sent a buckle like she was upset

346
00:28:14.90 --> 00:28:21.30
Yeah, I had like sent him the recipe to make the buckle of it is it is legit a secret recipe and there's one thing

347
00:28:22.10 --> 00:28:26.34
That she does to make it as good and I'll I'll tell you what it is after the podcast

348
00:28:26.74 --> 00:28:28.74
Yeah, it's no one else does it

349
00:28:29.14 --> 00:28:30.66
It's an old Spartan

350
00:28:30.66 --> 00:28:36.58
That's yeah, there you go. That's Pete's mom's special recipe. Okay, so there's got to be demand there's got to be

351
00:28:36.58 --> 00:28:41.86
Something driving this growth obviously, you know, and it's been a it's been a

352
00:28:42.82 --> 00:28:44.82
continual kind of

353
00:28:45.78 --> 00:28:48.98
Rapid and I'm rapid continual product

354
00:28:50.02 --> 00:28:54.50
Invention for lack of a better work yeah, and one of the things and you and I were talking this morning

355
00:28:55.86 --> 00:28:59.86
I was holding I was putting on a I was getting another rift ghee

356
00:29:01.38 --> 00:29:04.42
And I know not everyone does you do too, but

357
00:29:04.42 --> 00:29:07.70
The rift ghee is like

358
00:29:08.98 --> 00:29:15.46
It's like a complete it's it's like a new product. It's like it doesn't exist until now and it's weird to say that about

359
00:29:15.46 --> 00:29:20.02
I guess it'd be I don't know what's a good what's a clothing product that like completely

360
00:29:21.30 --> 00:29:27.70
Change like it didn't exist and now it does I would say that's easy that that would be the compression shirt under

361
00:29:27.70 --> 00:29:30.26
I'm okay, I'm out with because we both like college football

362
00:29:30.26 --> 00:29:35.94
Remember we had the grades the cotton the culture it's in the cotton shorts and you wore that cotton T-shirt underneath

363
00:29:35.94 --> 00:29:41.46
Football pads and then under our my came out with the the football shirt and it changed it changed again

364
00:29:41.46 --> 00:29:46.10
Now you would you're not gonna play with this old thing anymore never wear anything else again

365
00:29:46.10 --> 00:29:50.58
Right, and that's what the rift is like you're not you're not gonna what you're not gonna go. Oh

366
00:29:51.06 --> 00:29:55.22
Cool, I'm just gonna wear another ghee today because I have it notes. No. I just I'm just gonna wear this ghee

367
00:29:55.94 --> 00:29:57.54
the

368
00:29:57.54 --> 00:29:59.38
the the whole thing is

369
00:29:59.38 --> 00:30:01.38
engineered

370
00:30:01.06 --> 00:30:08.42
brand new yeah, right you I did you it was the football jersey thing like was that an inspiration for coming up with a rift?

371
00:30:08.98 --> 00:30:15.06
I absolutely the because the performance like we developed this poly synth fiber

372
00:30:15.78 --> 00:30:17.78
What I like to say is you know we

373
00:30:18.58 --> 00:30:21.86
We didn't just manufacture it we synthesized this

374
00:30:21.86 --> 00:30:23.86
I don't know I mean like

375
00:30:23.86 --> 00:30:30.90
It synthesized and we you know I don't I don't know if I told you how much money we spent on developing this

376
00:30:30.90 --> 00:30:32.90
You might have kept that for me

377
00:30:33.94 --> 00:30:38.18
I probably just did take Kelly, but you know we we had the I think I told you we had the order

378
00:30:38.18 --> 00:30:43.30
It's a batch of yarn we had and you've got to set up the friggin loom and there's 3,000 ends

379
00:30:43.86 --> 00:30:49.38
Right and it and it takes 60 hours to set it up and and we had to have the yarn spun and then we did it and we're like

380
00:30:50.42 --> 00:30:52.42
It's not good enough

381
00:30:52.42 --> 00:30:54.42
so you have all these

382
00:30:54.82 --> 00:30:58.74
prototypes, you know we've got to get rid of now we've got to get the yarn again

383
00:30:58.74 --> 00:31:02.18
They were like it's not twisted strong enough. It's pilling too much

384
00:31:02.50 --> 00:31:05.78
We need to talk the ends and you're talking these little freaking fibers

385
00:31:06.50 --> 00:31:09.14
individual fibers, you know and well

386
00:31:09.46 --> 00:31:13.14
It's not abrasion resistance enough and so you know

387
00:31:13.54 --> 00:31:20.26
When you take away the garment itself and the cut and the spiral wrap and how it function on your body and you go right back to the fiber

388
00:31:20.26 --> 00:31:27.78
That's where we had the start, you know we had the start from that point and then develop the weave the dragon weave jen three

389
00:31:28.58 --> 00:31:35.94
And it's hard to explain unless you put it on of course you were down there again like king Arthur like the riff to be old

390
00:31:37.78 --> 00:31:39.78
And you put it on you know and you're like

391
00:31:39.78 --> 00:31:41.38
Brown bro

392
00:31:41.38 --> 00:31:46.10
This thing is just ridiculous and that was by the way fresh out of the package

393
00:31:46.10 --> 00:31:52.26
When you take any piece of clothing fresh out of the package it well in my opinion it all sucks coming out of the package

394
00:31:52.58 --> 00:31:59.70
When you take it out of the package, you know this doesn't this thing is out of the package. It's brand new and you put it on and it feels like

395
00:32:00.66 --> 00:32:03.14
It feels like it's been you've skinned a unicorn. Yeah

396
00:32:04.90 --> 00:32:08.18
Something like that so so that's like an example of

397
00:32:09.38 --> 00:32:10.42
product

398
00:32:10.42 --> 00:32:11.78
moving forward

399
00:32:11.78 --> 00:32:13.78
making things and

400
00:32:13.78 --> 00:32:20.02
and this is the the other kind of thing that is happening because of our sport

401
00:32:20.66 --> 00:32:26.34
Stuff has to be extremely durable, right? So you're making something that just doesn't feel good because you can make something that feels good

402
00:32:26.66 --> 00:32:28.66
That has to be durable

403
00:32:28.66 --> 00:32:33.94
And that's the tricky part right because if you look at the way they make things soft or

404
00:32:35.46 --> 00:32:38.26
To feel good against the skin usually what that means is there

405
00:32:38.26 --> 00:32:46.02
Detair you're rating the textile a little bit right they're breaking it down so that those fibers touch your skin and they feel

406
00:32:46.02 --> 00:32:48.02
I'll smooth and comfortable and

407
00:32:48.42 --> 00:32:54.66
We couldn't deteriorate the strength of the garment so we had to find a way to do that with the yarn

408
00:32:55.22 --> 00:33:01.06
Right, that's the keys find a way to make the yarn comfortable and then the weave and then make the garment

409
00:33:01.38 --> 00:33:07.86
Former and body in the way I explain is like if you took a if you took a baseball or a crossball and you took this piece of paper and

410
00:33:07.86 --> 00:33:11.46
You're wrapped it around see if you can get it smooth. Can you get a smooth?

411
00:33:11.70 --> 00:33:16.98
No, you're gonna have wrinkles all through it, right and and that's what basically every gear on the planet is like

412
00:33:17.86 --> 00:33:24.10
All right now if you take that same piece of paper and you just strip it into straight strips and then you start wrapping those strips around that ball

413
00:33:24.10 --> 00:33:26.10
What you're gonna get you're gonna get a smooth surface

414
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:31.22
That's why we call the spiral wrap because it strips that spiral around your body

415
00:33:31.54 --> 00:33:33.94
You know and seven seven panels and

416
00:33:33.94 --> 00:33:40.58
Yeah, it's innovative. I don't know if there's another it shouldn't exist the garment shouldn't exist. Yeah

417
00:33:41.14 --> 00:33:47.70
So coming off of that and while you're working on that and I'm all this is coming home from a trip

418
00:33:47.86 --> 00:33:52.98
And when I was up here and seeing the factory and being you know just kind of in that

419
00:33:53.62 --> 00:33:55.62
Spiritual high

420
00:33:56.34 --> 00:34:00.18
From seeing our people American people working hard

421
00:34:00.18 --> 00:34:06.98
Like dedicated like passionate about doing a good like just seeing everything in action and I was flying home

422
00:34:06.98 --> 00:34:08.98
And I remember I was laid over somewhere

423
00:34:09.78 --> 00:34:16.74
And I'm sitting in the airport and I'm just looking at everyone while I'm sitting there and I see that

424
00:34:17.30 --> 00:34:20.42
And I called you and I said hey Pete man

425
00:34:21.06 --> 00:34:27.38
And you said yeah, and I said how many people do you know that you that do you jiu jitsu and you're like

426
00:34:27.38 --> 00:34:32.90
Um, I don't know a hundred and I was like cool

427
00:34:33.62 --> 00:34:41.14
How many people do you know that wear jeans and you said everyone and I said I'm in the airport right now

428
00:34:41.86 --> 00:34:46.10
And eight out of ten people are wearing jeans. I remember that conversation

429
00:34:46.74 --> 00:34:51.94
We need to make jeans and you go I've always wanted to make jeans

430
00:34:51.94 --> 00:34:57.46
You said I've always wanted to make jeans and

431
00:34:58.66 --> 00:35:02.74
That was the opening of a whole new

432
00:35:03.46 --> 00:35:07.54
Game right a whole new market and a whole new world

433
00:35:08.42 --> 00:35:13.70
From that conversation what was the next step from there?

434
00:35:14.74 --> 00:35:17.22
You know when we had that conversation

435
00:35:18.34 --> 00:35:20.58
And I don't know you might have told me this fact

436
00:35:20.58 --> 00:35:26.10
In America there's 300 million Americans you know how many Americans actually own jeans

437
00:35:27.06 --> 00:35:31.06
298 million

438
00:35:31.06 --> 00:35:33.06
298 million

439
00:35:34.10 --> 00:35:38.90
People own jeans and there's two million communists that don't know jeans

440
00:35:42.26 --> 00:35:44.26
You know it was uh

441
00:35:44.26 --> 00:35:48.26
I knew we could make the product you know and honestly like

442
00:35:48.26 --> 00:35:53.14
I always wanted like I couldn't have fit for a nice jeans as a kid

443
00:35:53.46 --> 00:35:59.46
You know I remember going into like the banana republic or the gab and basically looking at stuff and trying it on and

444
00:36:00.42 --> 00:36:04.42
You know four kids my mom you know 24 thousand dollars a year with four kids

445
00:36:04.66 --> 00:36:13.06
She just didn't have a lot of extra and we would get like one nice thing before the school year started and of course school starts for our kids my daughter started school today

446
00:36:13.70 --> 00:36:15.70
You know and I think about what she has

447
00:36:15.70 --> 00:36:22.82
And what you know the hard what hard work has has allowed us to do for the kids to start school with new

448
00:36:22.82 --> 00:36:29.14
Personacres and some clothes and I think about like jeans have always been important to me because we couldn't afford them

449
00:36:29.86 --> 00:36:31.62
And it was it was always the

450
00:36:32.58 --> 00:36:37.70
It wasn't just the style of it but it made you feel alive it made they made you feel free

451
00:36:38.26 --> 00:36:42.26
You know and they've always represented that I mean in digging into

452
00:36:42.26 --> 00:36:53.78
Denham in around the globe not just America if you start connecting denim you see they represent like freedom revolution independence empowerment right they represent these things and

453
00:36:55.14 --> 00:36:58.42
I was so damn excited you were on board with it

454
00:36:58.90 --> 00:37:02.42
I just like yes, I think it was just like yep

455
00:37:02.42 --> 00:37:05.86
You just need it a little you were like Frankenstein just need a little spark

456
00:37:05.86 --> 00:37:12.18
Yeah, you know when you come safe well, you know as exactly exactly just turn it on because

457
00:37:12.98 --> 00:37:19.86
You know managing you know all these people managing you know the factory a couple of occasions and the growth right

458
00:37:20.74 --> 00:37:22.74
Of course you don't want to make mistakes

459
00:37:23.30 --> 00:37:27.46
You still got to be a little bit naive enough to think you can you can do it though and

460
00:37:28.18 --> 00:37:32.66
I knew we could do it because we've been making this stuff for combat sports

461
00:37:32.66 --> 00:37:39.46
We've been making products that people are yanking on ripping at pulling wrapping around arms and heads with

462
00:37:40.50 --> 00:37:44.18
And I knew we had to set up to make durable goods and

463
00:37:45.78 --> 00:37:51.30
Denham was to me it was like well if we make this it will be the most

464
00:37:52.02 --> 00:37:57.14
Durable jeans ever made because we're gonna apply the same techniques and concepts

465
00:37:57.14 --> 00:38:04.66
We've developed for the past six years manufacturing stuff for combat sports and we're gonna apply the same thing to this

466
00:38:06.02 --> 00:38:11.38
And that's what we did and we just did it man. I mean, I don't even know how to explain

467
00:38:11.38 --> 00:38:17.06
I go I mean we got leaves our pattern maker and we just started having a work and I overnight

468
00:38:17.06 --> 00:38:20.82
You samples send it back where you know in the first ones weren't amazing

469
00:38:21.46 --> 00:38:23.46
They were but honestly like

470
00:38:23.46 --> 00:38:28.66
Got the textile right you know American cotton little bit of stretch

471
00:38:28.66 --> 00:38:34.02
You know modern but still super durable and then we started sewing it together with those

472
00:38:34.58 --> 00:38:39.14
Three needle like chain stitch machines. No, which you just don't find anymore. No, you know

473
00:38:39.14 --> 00:38:44.42
You just don't you don't find it it's hard because if you go with two needles then you cut your cost of thread by

474
00:38:44.42 --> 00:38:49.14
E-sir and done if you go if you go into the store and look at what they actually have

475
00:38:49.54 --> 00:38:52.90
It's usually just one thread. Yeah the scene. You know it's just one one machine

476
00:38:52.90 --> 00:38:57.06
So and it's easy to cut costs like that and it's just like well, that's just not what we're doing so

477
00:38:58.02 --> 00:39:05.38
It was challenging you know, I think it's not just developing the product because you can and this is across the board when you're

478
00:39:05.38 --> 00:39:07.38
Starting something new

479
00:39:07.38 --> 00:39:13.14
Even though we've been making all these geese and and stuff for jiu-jitsu

480
00:39:14.02 --> 00:39:17.54
It's still a different product and they're still style

481
00:39:17.54 --> 00:39:23.14
You still have to have some type of style and you know call that form right well

482
00:39:24.02 --> 00:39:30.42
There's there's like jeans out there and it's all all all all form right and then you've got stuff that's just simply

483
00:39:30.42 --> 00:39:37.54
Function right and the idea is you've got a balance those two things out you can't be too over the top

484
00:39:38.02 --> 00:39:42.50
To extreme it's just like balancing out leadership. I mean, it's it's really the same thing

485
00:39:42.58 --> 00:39:44.90
Formant form function the balance of those two things

486
00:39:44.90 --> 00:39:50.26
You know and we didn't get it right right off. You know and you're like you're like bro this

487
00:39:50.74 --> 00:39:53.54
Yo here in the back, you know the riser in the back

488
00:39:54.42 --> 00:39:59.86
Just just not doing it for me. Yeah, it's weird too for me because I never paid attention to it before right? You noticed that

489
00:39:59.86 --> 00:40:06.42
Oh, yeah, no too much as soon as I got it I was looking at other jeans that I had and saying okay here's what's different

490
00:40:06.42 --> 00:40:11.06
I remember saying I'd be on like sending new pictures or here's I didn't even know what a yoke was

491
00:40:11.06 --> 00:40:17.86
But I realized it's like the part below the waistband where it gives you a little separation between the legs of the pants

492
00:40:18.34 --> 00:40:21.46
And I didn't never paid attention to before my life

493
00:40:21.46 --> 00:40:26.18
But I looked at it was like hey, this seems like it's a lot longer than mine right now

494
00:40:26.18 --> 00:40:30.98
Is there a benefit to that and you're like well here's the benefit and I said well here's the negative

495
00:40:30.98 --> 00:40:37.38
The negative is I got a pack I got a a pocket on my hamstring right now instead of on my ass cheek

496
00:40:37.38 --> 00:40:42.26
Which is where it needs to be form a form in function right so then it's like okay, we can tighten that up so

497
00:40:42.82 --> 00:40:47.38
The the other thing that's weird about it that know that I definitely don't think about

498
00:40:48.42 --> 00:40:55.14
Is when you make it and you say okay, this is what we are going to produce and you pull the trigger on that

499
00:40:55.62 --> 00:41:01.14
Like that's what you're gonna get so it better be good. It's kind of like I do relate in the fact that when you publish a book

500
00:41:01.54 --> 00:41:05.22
And you're gonna print 100,000 copies and

501
00:41:05.22 --> 00:41:08.58
Then you open it up and you find a mistake

502
00:41:09.14 --> 00:41:14.42
That's that stinks and that's that stinks and that's what happened

503
00:41:15.38 --> 00:41:18.98
You know the fur those right behind you right there. Yeah

504
00:41:20.10 --> 00:41:22.10
We went into production and

505
00:41:23.82 --> 00:41:29.06
They're coming off a line right we trained everybody and I thought we were good to go

506
00:41:29.70 --> 00:41:34.10
Initially, but they started coming off a line and we weren't used to working with you

507
00:41:34.10 --> 00:41:38.42
We're used to working with like compression textile because for all the rash guards and stuff we make

508
00:41:38.90 --> 00:41:41.54
But not a woven we're used to working with nits

509
00:41:41.94 --> 00:41:46.82
We've we've never worked with a woven so all of our machines were set up for rigid

510
00:41:47.22 --> 00:41:49.22
Right textiles that don't stretch and

511
00:41:49.70 --> 00:41:54.26
Like the first like few hundred pairs that came off we started to look at them

512
00:41:55.30 --> 00:41:57.30
more intently and

513
00:41:57.86 --> 00:41:59.86
We found that

514
00:41:59.86 --> 00:42:07.20
We made some mistakes and the mistake was somehow it was the the fabric was starting to grow oh

515
00:42:07.48 --> 00:42:09.48
grow it was growing

516
00:42:09.94 --> 00:42:11.30
because

517
00:42:11.30 --> 00:42:16.74
And this is something machines will never be able to do yeah, all right machines aren't people

518
00:42:16.74 --> 00:42:24.90
They can't they can't make adjustments on the fly you can only program a machine to do a task and it can do that one task well

519
00:42:25.30 --> 00:42:29.22
But they can't recognize when there's something wrong and then making adjustment

520
00:42:29.22 --> 00:42:32.18
Right it's gonna do one thing one speed one way

521
00:42:32.66 --> 00:42:40.90
That's a beautiful thing about humans right and in manufacturing to do it right if they want to do it right and that's a that's a key thing right there

522
00:42:40.90 --> 00:42:43.94
They've got to want to do it right because they could just keep rolling even though

523
00:42:43.94 --> 00:42:48.66
There's a problem and just keep cranking and this happens a lot this happens

524
00:42:48.66 --> 00:42:50.66
So you say it was growing what does that mean?

525
00:42:50.82 --> 00:42:55.94
The the textile the garment was growing because it was either being held

526
00:42:55.94 --> 00:43:01.86
Too hard or the tension of the machine and what we found is a mixture of both okay

527
00:43:02.10 --> 00:43:06.14
You know because we're used to making these real you know the stuff for

528
00:43:06.42 --> 00:43:12.50
Jiu-jitsu so you're holding it and and as as they were holding it that the textile was growing because it was a little bit of

529
00:43:12.66 --> 00:43:18.40
Likeering it God it was growing the whole thing was growing so that the 32's were coming offline and they like 36's

530
00:43:19.06 --> 00:43:22.60
So we had to make some adjustments on the fly

531
00:43:22.60 --> 00:43:28.52
To have to change the patterns recut a batch of denim and we just and you know

532
00:43:28.52 --> 00:43:30.44
It was the right move we just didn't release it

533
00:43:30.44 --> 00:43:33.64
We're just like no that's a big tuition payment

534
00:43:34.04 --> 00:43:36.28
That's just it's just gonna be a tuition payment

535
00:43:36.68 --> 00:43:42.32
You know and and push forward I mean and some of them had that is that what calls like the twist in the seam

536
00:43:42.32 --> 00:43:46.84
Yeah, I like to my son has a pair like one of these original ones and

537
00:43:47.56 --> 00:43:51.24
He's you know I look I look at him. I was like yeah look at the thing. He's I got no care

538
00:43:51.24 --> 00:43:55.88
Because he's cool. You think I don't care about what I look like my son is just like don't care

539
00:43:55.88 --> 00:43:57.80
Yeah, then he's like these are the best jeans

540
00:43:57.80 --> 00:44:01.08
I'm just wearing them anyway, so the seam on the outside of his leg

541
00:44:01.08 --> 00:44:05.62
We'll switch forward to his chin in the front. Yeah, we found one leg. We found an old

542
00:44:05.62 --> 00:44:09.24
We got a care an old research paper from like the forties

543
00:44:11.56 --> 00:44:15.32
Leg twist in jeans was the title of it. No kidding

544
00:44:15.32 --> 00:44:18.72
And so what what was the cause of that my old pattern maker Lisa

545
00:44:18.72 --> 00:44:25.16
She's 60364 she found the paper she brought it into the factory and is it as a whole

546
00:44:25.44 --> 00:44:28.88
Research thing like a college research leg twist in jeans

547
00:44:29.60 --> 00:44:35.44
What it is is that as the textiles being woven that it's called a twill and there's

548
00:44:35.44 --> 00:44:38.08
You know diagonal lines if you look at the jeans diagonal lines

549
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:41.44
In order to cut jeans

550
00:44:41.44 --> 00:44:50.40
Effectively to not get leg twist you have to cut them in pairs and those pairs have to be reversed opposite and we found that out after

551
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:52.40
Close to a thousand pairs

552
00:44:54.56 --> 00:44:57.04
Yeah, leg twist in jeans

553
00:44:57.44 --> 00:45:04.32
So you talk about manufacturing a product as simple as jeans and I mean what did it take us before we launched it?

554
00:45:04.32 --> 00:45:07.80
I mean we did it fast man like what six months? Yeah, yeah

555
00:45:07.80 --> 00:45:15.40
We're sending me pairs pretty quick just launched. Yeah, so we finally got a figure it out and we got them launched and

556
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:19.08
I don't I you know if for phenomenal

557
00:45:19.08 --> 00:45:22.68
I don't know what else to say about the product itself, but man those

558
00:45:23.64 --> 00:45:27.56
Those ladies worked I'm saying ladies because our whole that whole floor is all women

559
00:45:27.80 --> 00:45:29.000
between the ages of

560
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.60
20 and

561
00:45:30.60 --> 00:45:32.60
60 and

562
00:45:32.60 --> 00:45:36.20
It's awesome seeing millennials work that want to work. Yeah

563
00:45:36.20 --> 00:45:41.24
Okay, like you know 10 of them on that floor cranking cranking and

564
00:45:42.20 --> 00:45:44.20
Yeah, we're gonna gather and

565
00:45:45.16 --> 00:45:49.56
Just like a beehive man just like a freaking beehive walking in that place in the morning

566
00:45:50.84 --> 00:45:52.12
We're gonna

567
00:45:52.12 --> 00:45:56.68
I don't know if you want me to say this or not about what about two we're gonna make another pair of jeans

568
00:45:56.68 --> 00:45:58.68
That's gonna be

569
00:45:58.68 --> 00:46:02.12
lighter weight now echo Charles. You'll just for your FYI

570
00:46:02.12 --> 00:46:06.12
Mm-hmm the jockel me I am requesting

571
00:46:06.68 --> 00:46:13.16
Lightweight jeans. Okay. Yeah kind of weird that caught on me. Yeah, that caught it. Don't want the lightweight hoodie

572
00:46:13.72 --> 00:46:15.72
Want the lightweight jeans

573
00:46:15.72 --> 00:46:21.24
Can't do you want to know why? Yes, you how many times my legs have been cold you know how many times have been like oh

574
00:46:21.96 --> 00:46:24.76
I don't want to be outside anymore because my legs are cold

575
00:46:24.76 --> 00:46:32.52
And if it's never happened. You know, I used to wear shorts all the you know all year long. They're snowing outside

576
00:46:32.52 --> 00:46:34.52
I wear shorts. Okay, so

577
00:46:35.80 --> 00:46:37.40
Lightweight jeans that'll be the next

578
00:46:38.36 --> 00:46:45.48
Next thing we're gonna make and and we've got a little tie back to my heritage in the navy in the seal teams

579
00:46:46.12 --> 00:46:47.48
because

580
00:46:47.48 --> 00:46:49.48
in the in Vietnam

581
00:46:49.80 --> 00:46:51.48
the

582
00:46:51.48 --> 00:47:00.04
Issued fatigues weren't durable enough for the combat operations at the seals were doing and so many of the seals in Vietnam

583
00:47:00.60 --> 00:47:08.20
War jeans and so we're gonna make some jeans. We've got a cool name form that I will not reveal

584
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:10.20
At this time

585
00:47:10.20 --> 00:47:12.20
I was like I'm waiting

586
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.60
To pull

587
00:47:14.60 --> 00:47:16.60
But you know the like I said and then we just

588
00:47:16.60 --> 00:47:24.84
The last podcast where do you haven't heard yet that then we just did with a seal master chief name Kirby Horelle who is just as

589
00:47:25.48 --> 00:47:29.08
Completely legit as they come as frog men and

590
00:47:29.96 --> 00:47:34.92
Yeah, you know, he's talking about wearing jeans and mom and so yeah, so we've got that

591
00:47:34.92 --> 00:47:39.08
We've got these lightweight jeans coming. I think that's gonna be and I already have actually already have three pairs

592
00:47:39.08 --> 00:47:41.08
Sorry

593
00:47:41.08 --> 00:47:44.44
Well, I have a pair. I've been I've been testing the goods

594
00:47:44.44 --> 00:47:48.52
Hmm myself so I spent 30 days in Europe last month

595
00:47:48.52 --> 00:47:54.92
I put 200 miles on the boots and I think it was 20,000 miles on the jeans as we traveled

596
00:47:55.56 --> 00:48:01.64
And man those things are getting worn in fading in and just the abrasion of movement and motion in life

597
00:48:02.52 --> 00:48:05.16
It's awesome dude. It's freaking awesome. So

598
00:48:06.04 --> 00:48:08.84
And you know people like why you're so damn excited about jeans

599
00:48:09.48 --> 00:48:12.52
Well, 298 million Americans own jeans

600
00:48:12.52 --> 00:48:19.40
Because they're cool, but it's really what they represent you know and I learned something recently that

601
00:48:20.28 --> 00:48:24.92
You know after the great before the great depression and I can go into an old antique store and you see the

602
00:48:24.92 --> 00:48:27.40
Trunks and they got the stickers all over on the postcards

603
00:48:27.80 --> 00:48:32.12
You know well people were traveling to Europe before the great depression

604
00:48:32.12 --> 00:48:35.72
They were going on vacation for they'd go for like a month or two at a time, right?

605
00:48:36.20 --> 00:48:38.20
And then the great depression happened and

606
00:48:38.20 --> 00:48:45.80
And every everybody just kind of hunkered down and they didn't feel confident enough to go on these

607
00:48:45.80 --> 00:48:48.60
Voyages, right? Ships these voyages

608
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.44
So what they decided to do is go and explore the American West and

609
00:48:53.32 --> 00:48:57.48
What I've heard is that the cowboys out there were wearing

610
00:48:58.52 --> 00:49:00.52
denim blue jeans and

611
00:49:01.80 --> 00:49:05.96
And the idea and I'm digging into this through research is that

612
00:49:05.96 --> 00:49:14.12
That's where fashion and jeans started in the US so the city slickers from the east went out west

613
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:17.24
saw the free range

614
00:49:17.80 --> 00:49:23.80
cowboys and said yeah and and took that free spirit attitude

615
00:49:24.36 --> 00:49:31.40
Back to the east coast and there you go. I still got to prove it, but that's your theory. Yes. Yes

616
00:49:32.68 --> 00:49:34.68
now

617
00:49:34.68 --> 00:49:40.52
I remember this. How do you remember do you remember like the Berlin wall do you remember East Berlin as well as I do?

618
00:49:41.08 --> 00:49:41.48
I

619
00:49:41.48 --> 00:49:49.32
From my channel. No you know about it. Yeah, yes, I do but I didn't get it. I remember watching the wall come down. It was 89

620
00:49:50.04 --> 00:49:55.72
I was 10 years old 11 years old maybe and I absolutely remember it. I remember

621
00:49:55.72 --> 00:50:08.84
I remember honestly feeling unsure because I didn't understand why these men with these sledge hammers

622
00:50:09.40 --> 00:50:13.96
were slamming that wall with such anger and then elation

623
00:50:14.76 --> 00:50:21.80
Didn't register and I remember the conversation and the house of my parents talking about freedom and communism

624
00:50:21.80 --> 00:50:25.88
and I had no idea what these concepts. I didn't know anything about them

625
00:50:27.48 --> 00:50:36.04
But then when the wall came down and they were accepted into their friends and family watching them come across. I was just like

626
00:50:36.76 --> 00:50:43.40
They've been separated. I just remember that not knowing what communism wanted was or separation or anything. I just

627
00:50:43.40 --> 00:50:48.12
remember that they were they were they were imprisoned basically. Yeah and

628
00:50:48.12 --> 00:50:55.80
Yeah, of course I was there last month so I yeah because what I remember when I was a kid you know at my school like kids would

629
00:50:56.68 --> 00:50:58.92
go on like a school trip

630
00:50:59.80 --> 00:51:01.80
to wherever

631
00:51:01.80 --> 00:51:03.40
England or

632
00:51:03.40 --> 00:51:06.28
Spain or something like that like the Spanish

633
00:51:06.76 --> 00:51:09.96
class there'd be kids that would go on a school trip

634
00:51:11.40 --> 00:51:12.44
and

635
00:51:12.44 --> 00:51:17.80
what people would say is like you got to bring jeans bring jeans you can sell them. Yes, you can sell them

636
00:51:17.80 --> 00:51:23.32
and there was like a black market to get those things into the eastern block country. You could sell a pair of

637
00:51:23.32 --> 00:51:26.36
American you know standard American jeans that cost

638
00:51:26.76 --> 00:51:33.000
$16 at the grocery store at the department store and you could bring them to sell them for a hundred dollars

639
00:51:33.64 --> 00:51:34.68
I remember hearing that

640
00:51:34.68 --> 00:51:40.68
$100 and I had like two pairs of jeans or three pairs of jeans and I'm thinking hey can you take these

641
00:51:40.68 --> 00:51:44.44
can you try and get a hundred dollars for these things and that was

642
00:51:44.44 --> 00:51:50.04
and that to me has always said that those people over there identified

643
00:51:50.76 --> 00:51:55.16
blue jeans like the like you're saying the East Coast you look at the cowboy and said that's the

644
00:51:55.16 --> 00:52:04.12
spirit of freedom right there and you know the thing is is you know when I get into something

645
00:52:04.12 --> 00:52:08.28
I go deep that's why we ended up building a factory in my backyard

646
00:52:08.28 --> 00:52:15.88
but I need to I need to understand more about why jeans represented

647
00:52:16.60 --> 00:52:22.12
revolution anyways we were in East Berlin last month and working on this project doing

648
00:52:22.12 --> 00:52:29.64
some research and I sat down with a woman who lived in East Germany

649
00:52:30.60 --> 00:52:37.48
her dad was a spy and you know they had I and I didn't realize this they had access to the

650
00:52:37.48 --> 00:52:43.64
West in terms of the news and the media and everything it wasn't like they were closed off from that

651
00:52:43.64 --> 00:52:49.88
and I think that might be a misconception they could see it but they couldn't touch it right so it's

652
00:52:49.88 --> 00:52:54.12
almost like like they're they're they're in a cage and they can see what's happening outside

653
00:52:54.12 --> 00:53:01.32
but they can't they can't touch it and so we sat down and we had dinner in this old Russian restaurant

654
00:53:01.32 --> 00:53:07.72
and it was it was like this this scene like you'd see it a movie or something you know with

655
00:53:07.72 --> 00:53:13.16
the yellow lights and all the pictures on the wall and we're sitting there intimate like this

656
00:53:13.96 --> 00:53:23.48
having dinner and she told me about growing up in the East and as she got into the conversation

657
00:53:24.12 --> 00:53:30.44
she reached in her dot and her bag and pulled out her diary from her childhood and she's like

658
00:53:30.44 --> 00:53:36.04
let me show you something and she opened the diary and there was a tag in there a Wrangler tag

659
00:53:36.04 --> 00:53:42.44
and she said this was my from my first pair of jeans and this tag was beat up and worn in

660
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:50.60
and and her jeans deteriorated but she saved that tag and then she flipped the page and in a

661
00:53:50.60 --> 00:53:57.000
diary she was she had a little bit it this one was name was Anya Anna and and her friend had gone

662
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.92
in New York City and she had written you know in in a girl's diary she had and she has jeans and

663
00:54:02.92 --> 00:54:06.92
she took the pen and she underlined it and she took a highlighter and she highlighted it

664
00:54:07.56 --> 00:54:13.40
and she's like I didn't really understand how important it was to me until you and I started talking

665
00:54:13.40 --> 00:54:22.76
because we had talked the day before and she said the first time in my life I ever feel empowered

666
00:54:22.76 --> 00:54:29.40
as an individual was when I got my first pair of jeans when I was 13 and I put them on

667
00:54:29.96 --> 00:54:37.32
the first time I had only worn dresses what they gave us to wear and I put those jeans on for the

668
00:54:37.32 --> 00:54:42.68
first time and I felt free and if you wanted to still this thing down why it's so important

669
00:54:43.32 --> 00:54:50.68
look at that you know what I just realized so I have a I have a 10 year old daughter and

670
00:54:50.68 --> 00:54:58.04
she's been wearing your daughter might be too old for this trend but a lot of girls right now

671
00:54:58.04 --> 00:55:05.64
that are younger maybe six seven eight nine they were basically a matching kind of whole

672
00:55:06.20 --> 00:55:13.88
polyester like dry fit type outfit like that's the whole thing right like the and it all matches

673
00:55:13.88 --> 00:55:19.08
it looks like a weird tie dye looking thing and you know my daughter must have had like three or

674
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:22.84
four of them and she would just rotate them like that's just just just what and her and all

675
00:55:22.84 --> 00:55:27.48
of her friends they look like somebody spilled crayons everywhere and that's what that's the

676
00:55:27.48 --> 00:55:31.000
all that's kind of like and I think from a mom's perspective you know it's really easy you know

677
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:39.08
just there you go you know just wear this and my other daughters and my other daughters took her shopping

678
00:55:40.52 --> 00:55:47.16
and when she came home she says dad I'm gonna go put on some of the clothes I got and she had

679
00:55:47.16 --> 00:55:51.16
she was she came out and she was wearing a pair of jeans and it was her first pair of jeans

680
00:55:51.16 --> 00:55:54.76
believe it or not wow because we live in California there's no we don't wear jeans out there

681
00:55:55.32 --> 00:56:00.20
we were shorts or you're if you're a eight year old girl you wear these outfits these matching

682
00:56:00.20 --> 00:56:04.76
little what is it nylon is that what it is what is it I don't know this P wear those things

683
00:56:05.32 --> 00:56:11.08
yes okay yeah like a weight is that a romper yeah romp yeah well it's like that but it's all it's like a

684
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:16.92
woo it's just an outfit and every little girl yeah super a lot of it so my daughter comes out of

685
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:21.96
her room and you know she's 10 you know and she's tall for a 10 year old but all of a sudden she

686
00:56:21.96 --> 00:56:26.68
had jeans on it and I could see now that you're I'm connecting you know she looks so

687
00:56:27.48 --> 00:56:33.000
proud and you know kind of like she was standing on straight like she was now in you know

688
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.80
in the big leagues kind of and she you know you know that time you go through your life

689
00:56:37.80 --> 00:56:44.60
for your like I'm a person yes she looked like she had that kind of I'm a person I'm an individual

690
00:56:44.60 --> 00:56:51.88
I'm a I'm a person I got I'm I'm here confident yes I'm here yeah the I'm not mom is

691
00:56:51.88 --> 00:56:57.96
little girl anymore now you're here and how much of that comes from my daughter's going you need to

692
00:56:57.96 --> 00:57:05.16
get jeans you know what I mean you need to get jeans yeah that's in my kids that's in my kids

693
00:57:06.04 --> 00:57:13.000
psyche that you you know what you get jeans and that's when you become an individual human

694
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.68
ready to take on the world that's so cool and it's crazy because it really does you know it

695
00:57:20.68 --> 00:57:28.84
really does like it just you know when you wear something like and that's the that's the important

696
00:57:28.84 --> 00:57:34.12
I mean it's a it's a beautiful thing really you know to that you can be empowered by something on

697
00:57:34.12 --> 00:57:39.80
your body you know and and people say well that's that's not it's not important you know what you

698
00:57:39.80 --> 00:57:44.20
wear well it's really not important what you wear but it is important how you feel about yourself

699
00:57:44.20 --> 00:57:49.72
you know it is important how you project yourself you know I mean if you if you're working

700
00:57:49.72 --> 00:57:53.88
for a restaurant front going somewhere you know do you wear a teacher if you go on Fox News what

701
00:57:53.88 --> 00:57:59.08
do you put on yeah I put on suit why because that's what you put on that's right right

702
00:58:00.68 --> 00:58:04.68
I think that's important I think the next time I might be going on I might be wearing some orange

703
00:58:04.68 --> 00:58:09.88
jeans boy this is what I this is something else I just realized think about this okay

704
00:58:10.84 --> 00:58:16.36
do you have a you get a pair of slacks right get a pair of slacks what's another word for that pants

705
00:58:16.36 --> 00:58:22.52
trousers trousers or whatever you get a pair of pants those if you just get a normal pair of pants

706
00:58:22.52 --> 00:58:29.08
whatever they they'll change a little bit over time but basically the change that they go through

707
00:58:29.08 --> 00:58:35.80
deteriorates them and they're no longer usable but jeans are different jeans wear and they become

708
00:58:36.36 --> 00:58:41.80
comfortable and they come to your body they like they like they wear them or not yes they wear

709
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:46.92
S they wear in not out but they become yours like you can't if one if you have a nice pair of jeans

710
00:58:46.92 --> 00:58:51.24
that's broken and they've had for a while and something happens to them you have to go get another

711
00:58:51.24 --> 00:58:56.28
pair and you have to go through a period of time where you they're not quite your jeans yet and you know

712
00:58:56.28 --> 00:59:07.80
what's crazy is is that woman on you I was I was with she told me she's like you know

713
00:59:08.36 --> 00:59:15.32
they they tried to make jeans because eventually you didn't have to smuggle them in any more eventually

714
00:59:16.04 --> 00:59:22.60
you if you knew somebody outside they could ship you the jeans if they could afford them right

715
00:59:22.60 --> 00:59:30.68
so they became so popular that East Berlin government decided East Germany government decided

716
00:59:30.68 --> 00:59:40.04
we're gonna make jeans and they did they made jeans and I picked up a pair of those jeans I

717
00:59:40.04 --> 00:59:46.76
found someone who had a pair and they weren't jeans they didn't know how to weave the text out

718
00:59:46.76 --> 00:59:51.24
and they couldn't figure it out so what one of they were they just like some weird fabric like

719
00:59:51.24 --> 00:59:57.08
it was a weird fabric and it wasn't even in the go died so they would never they wouldn't even

720
00:59:57.08 --> 01:00:06.60
fade in they would just like blue material yeah it was it was crazy so it failed miserably and she

721
01:00:06.60 --> 01:00:15.32
said so the the government imported a million pairs of American jeans and they sold out like

722
01:00:15.32 --> 01:00:20.92
the like the day they arrived that's the kind of thing where you realize that's why communism doesn't

723
01:00:20.92 --> 01:00:26.52
work yeah because the state can't figure it out you know but individuals can't so give them some

724
01:00:26.52 --> 01:00:34.76
jeans and let them run wild now okay jeans we got that we might have gone a little bit

725
01:00:34.76 --> 01:00:39.16
I don't know we little ripped but hey all right now the other thing you said is you put

726
01:00:39.16 --> 01:00:46.12
miles on boots yeah now this is a little bit of a reversal role where I said you like hey bro

727
01:00:47.16 --> 01:00:55.88
everyone wears jeans you said to me hey man we need to make boots and that made me that made me

728
01:00:55.88 --> 01:01:03.24
nervous because I look at boots I said hey man like these are everyone's feet are different

729
01:01:03.24 --> 01:01:09.000
it's hard to make and it's you got the sizes I mean they're you can't hand them a pair of boots like

730
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.88
boots are what size they are and and and people's complain about blisters and you know in a

731
01:01:15.88 --> 01:01:21.96
seal platoon everybody wants a different kind of boots so I was definitely more hesitant on the

732
01:01:22.52 --> 01:01:28.84
on the just the product itself and then on the manufacturing to me it just seemed like crazy thing

733
01:01:28.84 --> 01:01:32.92
and you you're laughing I don't know if you remember this you were laughing you were like you were

734
01:01:32.92 --> 01:01:39.16
laughing you like bro it's so much easier to make boots and it is to make to to weave fabric on a

735
01:01:39.16 --> 01:01:44.68
loop yeah and I think some of that laughter was more like I'm ready for the challenge you know what

736
01:01:44.68 --> 01:01:49.80
I mean like this is the thing is is you know and just in full transparency you know you and I

737
01:01:49.80 --> 01:01:54.12
had a private conversation at the end of the last year and like okay what are we gonna do you know

738
01:01:54.12 --> 01:02:00.28
what are we gonna do to grow and we wanted to make the investment you know of our profit and put it

739
01:02:00.28 --> 01:02:09.000
back into the company and and we're identifying where we want to grow right and what's going

740
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.56
to have the biggest impact on the community but also what the community can handle right and we

741
01:02:13.56 --> 01:02:19.88
know they can handle making denim blue jeans and I knew the community could not only handle but

742
01:02:19.88 --> 01:02:26.36
but if we could make footwear again I just need to clarify this when you're talking about the

743
01:02:26.36 --> 01:02:31.88
community what you're talking about is the actual community within which you live within which are

744
01:02:31.88 --> 01:02:38.84
factory is within which we have a pool of people that's the community that actually have this skill set

745
01:02:38.84 --> 01:02:45.72
and that's the part that I didn't appreciate and as soon as you you were like hey because I'm thinking

746
01:02:45.72 --> 01:02:50.52
how are we gonna make shoes you said we got the people and then I remember growing up of course

747
01:02:50.52 --> 01:02:56.04
who is up here all these massive shoe manufacturers were up here and I said oh yeah obviously okay

748
01:02:56.04 --> 01:03:04.92
check run exactly I mean shit I mean new balance is still in main doing some stuff

749
01:03:06.04 --> 01:03:14.20
Nike used to be in main you had you had basho you had dexter shoe you had Hayden shoe

750
01:03:14.20 --> 01:03:21.72
Allen Edmunds I mean you had all these brands and one of our employees Christine she actually

751
01:03:21.72 --> 01:03:28.28
was the one who went to the Dominican when the free trade agreements went into play and trained them

752
01:03:28.28 --> 01:03:33.56
on she was the best little waist stitcher in the country she trained them how to use that machine

753
01:03:34.20 --> 01:03:39.96
so she was part of let's call it a brain drain a skills drain right where the skills need to

754
01:03:39.96 --> 01:03:45.96
go away well happens when they go away she's the only one left with those skills right and I had

755
01:03:45.96 --> 01:03:51.48
identified a few people with those skills and these old shoe dogs one of them was Bart Hershey

756
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:57.08
you know and the sold guy Roland land and shoe dog is the name of that book is that a term

757
01:03:57.08 --> 01:04:02.68
anyways shoe dogs yeah there's a book written uh yeah it's by the guy that made Nike exactly yeah

758
01:04:02.68 --> 01:04:08.04
shoe dog but that's a common term he didn't coin that no no that's what these guys are he was

759
01:04:08.04 --> 01:04:14.76
part of that god all these guys helped him get started this guy Roland is the one that

760
01:04:14.76 --> 01:04:19.40
helped Timberland start he's the one that had the machinery and the knowledge to get

761
01:04:19.40 --> 01:04:25.64
Timberland so they could mold a soul onto a leather offer he he developed that and so I had all these

762
01:04:25.64 --> 01:04:32.60
old timers who I had just honestly I didn't give an opportunity not to not to meet me like I just

763
01:04:32.60 --> 01:04:37.08
go to their factory calm on the phone you know show them what we're doing and getting front of them

764
01:04:37.08 --> 01:04:44.12
and then finally we started building relationships and this this one guy Roland I went over there

765
01:04:44.12 --> 01:04:51.80
and and he had to get rid of some machinery and we did some kind of negotiating and I was like

766
01:04:51.80 --> 01:04:56.28
what do you what do you want you know yeah I got to figure out what somebody wants yeah you know

767
01:04:56.28 --> 01:05:03.000
we ended up negotiating he's like can you do a lobster bake from my staff and I said yeah

768
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.92
he goes take it all loaded up a tractor trailer of machinery a small if I can 20 foot you know

769
01:05:11.64 --> 01:05:18.36
and a couple weeks ago Joe my father learned I and a few other guys from the factory went out

770
01:05:18.36 --> 01:05:25.88
and cooked his whole staff a lobster bake lobster bake for old shoe machinery but these shoe dogs

771
01:05:25.88 --> 01:05:31.88
so shoe dog is the term that is just used it's a general term for someone who's been in the

772
01:05:31.88 --> 01:05:39.08
industry for a long time but you know as we were talking at the end of the last year and you know I

773
01:05:39.08 --> 01:05:45.96
kind of put your I guess concerns that ease a little bit for sure for no it's like we can make shoes

774
01:05:45.96 --> 01:05:51.32
you know we don't have to reinvent anything even though we need to build it from scratch there's

775
01:05:51.32 --> 01:05:56.84
a difference there you know if we're going to like try to figure it out and not have the knowledge that

776
01:05:56.84 --> 01:06:03.88
would be one thing but the knowledge has only been it's only been removed for 20 years right if it

777
01:06:03.88 --> 01:06:11.32
had been removed for 50 years I'm not going to say it's impossible but I would have taken a lot

778
01:06:11.96 --> 01:06:20.28
larger effort and a lot bigger a lot more costly tuition yes the tuition in the effort right now

779
01:06:20.28 --> 01:06:27.96
has been great and and the expenses been great I mean we're in month 8 and this week we're finally

780
01:06:27.96 --> 01:06:35.56
ready to really launch as you saw the factory the other day but you're talking about okay

781
01:06:35.56 --> 01:06:40.68
Jocco Jocco's blessing you know the teams on board what are we going to do I had one person

782
01:06:40.68 --> 01:06:50.04
one person Henry and he'd been in the industry for 40 years and he started January first

783
01:06:50.84 --> 01:06:56.68
I gave him a piece of paper with how I wanted the boot to look and I said this is what we want to build

784
01:06:58.28 --> 01:07:05.08
now just just so you know everyone understands I know you get it that we're talking about starting

785
01:07:05.08 --> 01:07:11.56
something from scratch all right we don't have any machinery we don't have asses and seats which is

786
01:07:11.56 --> 01:07:18.92
my way of saying human resources we don't have the workflow we don't have the raw materials we

787
01:07:18.92 --> 01:07:24.68
don't have the patterns we don't have the dice zero I gave him a piece of paper with an

788
01:07:24.68 --> 01:07:34.04
illustrator drawing and said this is what we want to make that's crazy not really not really crazy

789
01:07:34.04 --> 01:07:45.08
because if you can see when you when you see people work together we're each one has a skill set

790
01:07:45.08 --> 01:07:50.28
in in and I know this is like on the seal teams like I'm sure when you did operations and

791
01:07:50.28 --> 01:07:54.36
everything was just moving it's like a perfect but it's like a Russian ballet it's like a perfect flow

792
01:07:54.36 --> 01:08:01.88
of organization right and I had seen it in the rest of the factory and how we did the rest of the factory

793
01:08:01.88 --> 01:08:07.72
and that's why I knew we could do it but I also knew that the challenges of building something for a foot

794
01:08:07.72 --> 01:08:11.32
you know that that a foot everyone's feet are different and they're they're they're they're

795
01:08:11.32 --> 01:08:17.88
odd shaped they're asymmetrical you know it's a strange thing a foot a new we're going to have

796
01:08:17.88 --> 01:08:24.20
challenges asymmetrical they're not the same they're not the same I knew we were going to have challenges

797
01:08:24.76 --> 01:08:28.76
and I know I haven't told you about all the tuition payments but I'm going to tell you I'm

798
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:38.92
going to tell you about the couple that I'm in skip what happened all my money so we we got into it

799
01:08:38.92 --> 01:08:43.80
and you know and we made some boots you know to start off but it was all you know Henry with an

800
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:49.16
exacto knife like hand cutting everything whatever we started building the patterns they weren't

801
01:08:49.16 --> 01:08:54.68
perfect so you got to imagine like eight months we're now into this thing eight months

802
01:08:54.68 --> 01:09:05.24
once once we actually got a boot of course he started with a 14 wrong and that would bite us

803
01:09:05.24 --> 01:09:11.48
in the ass six months down the road that was that was the tuition payment I wanted him to start with a

804
01:09:11.48 --> 01:09:19.64
14 because I wanted to wear it first not knowing that six months down the road that would be a

805
01:09:19.64 --> 01:09:25.24
mistake because you never grade grading is how you scale everything you never grade from your

806
01:09:25.24 --> 01:09:29.88
largest size you always grade from the middle from the middle size yeah so I should have

807
01:09:29.88 --> 01:09:34.76
I should have made your size first you should ask me too because if you just asked me that question

808
01:09:34.76 --> 01:09:39.32
I would have said oh yeah because you probably lose a little bit of you lose a little bit of that shape

809
01:09:39.32 --> 01:09:46.52
and the what's the word the ratio the ratio the ratio is as you go up exactly that's what grading is

810
01:09:46.52 --> 01:09:56.84
yep so we needed all those things patterns to fit the foot leather we needed the knowledge of course

811
01:09:57.80 --> 01:10:04.44
clicker dies to cut the material but most of all we need shoemaking machinery so which these are very

812
01:10:04.44 --> 01:10:10.92
specialized machines incredibly specialized materials very specialized in it wasn't feasible to just

813
01:10:10.92 --> 01:10:19.48
buy new stuff you know I mean would it have been smartest to buy all new machinery yes yes it would have

814
01:10:19.48 --> 01:10:27.16
been interesting it would have been smartest if we wanted to take that risk and don't that amount of

815
01:10:27.16 --> 01:10:33.80
capital in it I was gonna say because it doesn't seem like that would be real smart exactly but you know

816
01:10:33.80 --> 01:10:40.68
what I knew I knew that Henry used to be a mill right and that if we could just get decent machinery

817
01:10:40.68 --> 01:10:45.88
even old machinery that was running he could keep it running and our little proof of concept

818
01:10:45.88 --> 01:10:53.32
called bringing back shoe manufacturing and Franklin County main if we could prove that concept it

819
01:10:53.32 --> 01:11:00.68
would be only a matter of time to be able to invest in in that new machinery so that's what we did

820
01:11:00.68 --> 01:11:06.60
we talked about how much is gonna be a lot alright let's do it so I ended up calling this old

821
01:11:06.60 --> 01:11:14.12
time or mo he's the one that found our first loom so I went back to the source mo this is what I want

822
01:11:14.12 --> 01:11:21.56
to do and he's wild you know this guy he he told me a story you you have heard of Dexter shoe of course

823
01:11:22.76 --> 01:11:30.52
there was a man named Harold Alphan no Harold Alphan built Dexter shoe he built it he was working

824
01:11:30.52 --> 01:11:36.44
at another shoe company he built it by loading up machines that weren't being used like in the

825
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:43.24
during the night time into his station wagon and driving them to a mill in Dexter he basically took

826
01:11:43.24 --> 01:11:48.28
the machines that were like the abandoned machines from the southern factory and he started

827
01:11:48.28 --> 01:11:56.36
a factory and he built an empire alright Harold Alphan he got bought out by Berkshire Hathaway

828
01:11:56.36 --> 01:12:02.92
they had a contract that when Harold Alphan died they could move Dexter shoe out of Maine

829
01:12:04.28 --> 01:12:09.000
Harold Alphan died a few years back they shot the factory down and moved the down of Maine

830
01:12:11.32 --> 01:12:15.000
this shit just it man it gets to me it gets to me

831
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:26.60
mo told me a story about Harold Alphan because mo's dad was an old shoe dog and he made the

832
01:12:26.60 --> 01:12:33.08
parts for the machine and he said let me tell you something you're gonna need my help doing this

833
01:12:34.84 --> 01:12:43.96
this is what I do this guy Harold Alphan he started this factory and he couldn't he wasn't

834
01:12:43.96 --> 01:12:49.48
getting it it wasn't making any money and he called my dad and he said can you come up to the factory

835
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:55.24
and this is back when it doesn't matter if this small time or trying to build this this shoe company

836
01:12:56.44 --> 01:13:01.40
hasn't even started selling product yet it's in the hole maybe has a handful of employees

837
01:13:01.40 --> 01:13:08.44
this guy's most dad drives up to Dexter two hours sits in front of Harold Alphan and Harold Alphan says

838
01:13:08.44 --> 01:13:18.28
can you buy these box of parts back from me I'll buy them back from you in three months

839
01:13:20.68 --> 01:13:27.80
and his dad said yeah I'll take them back took the parts back gave him the money three months later

840
01:13:27.80 --> 01:13:33.56
Harold Alphan bought him back this guy's worth I don't know a billion dollars now but this

841
01:13:33.56 --> 01:13:39.000
this thing of sitting in front of somebody and having a conversation and building relationships

842
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.64
what I found in this shoe making thing is the most important thing because these are still the

843
01:13:45.64 --> 01:13:53.24
guys running it the same guys running it in the in the in the dudes these shoe dogs that have been

844
01:13:53.24 --> 01:14:03.000
in the factory helping us combine age 88 90 and we've probably had a dozen in there and you should

845
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:10.84
see their freaking eyeballs when they walk in they don't want to leave honestly on occasion

846
01:14:10.84 --> 01:14:17.72
bringing tears to their eyes that that this is what we're doing because they saw it they were part of

847
01:14:17.72 --> 01:14:25.16
it and they saw it leave and just that spark man like you know I'm honestly just hit me

848
01:14:25.16 --> 01:14:30.76
it's me right in the feels man that spark they see it's motivation and I absolutely knew that

849
01:14:30.76 --> 01:14:41.000
were there support it was going to be possible and so we've been grinding this the first pair of boots

850
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.04
that that I got that you sent me the first pair of the boots you sent me it was better than the first

851
01:14:46.04 --> 01:14:51.000
pair of jeans you sent me that that was a shocker to me like it was like take them out of the box I was like

852
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.32
no way this is ridiculous and and you know you're like hey there's there these aren't perfect

853
01:14:57.32 --> 01:15:00.84
from sending them just so you can look at them and I was like no I'm wearing them I mean I was wearing

854
01:15:00.84 --> 01:15:07.24
them out of the box comfortable crazy that was crazy I was like bro what's wrong with your jeans

855
01:15:07.24 --> 01:15:13.96
dude you got like we had to figure out how to make jeans you know I mean we're as we had the

856
01:15:13.96 --> 01:15:20.44
knowledge base to make the footwear like it was still here you know and man I mean these guys

857
01:15:20.44 --> 01:15:24.92
came in and they just like dumped their knowledge on but Henry Henry being the key in this guy

858
01:15:24.92 --> 01:15:31.40
mole and so I'm like I need machinery so he found all the old machinery overseas he brought it back

859
01:15:31.40 --> 01:15:37.96
over on a purely bringing machinery that's been shipped overseas you're along with the jobs

860
01:15:37.96 --> 01:15:44.44
literally we're bringing it back to America you know actually happening actually happening

861
01:15:44.44 --> 01:15:50.68
machines designed in New Hampshire and it machines designed in Massachusetts manufactured

862
01:15:50.68 --> 01:15:57.48
right there bringing them back these old machines and Mo refurbished them and now they're in the

863
01:15:57.48 --> 01:16:06.36
factory and it's badass so what's the where we out right now I know we have the the leather for

864
01:16:07.32 --> 01:16:15.16
400 500 pairs yeah you know we we connected with the tannery that's 45 minutes away that's

865
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:23.16
nothing about supply chain right there's one tannery left in Maine and they just happened to

866
01:16:23.16 --> 01:16:30.68
manufacture all the leather for the military boots so we went up to them and they're like we'll

867
01:16:30.68 --> 01:16:35.96
we'll help you guys however we can so they're tanning leather for us they're tanning seven styles

868
01:16:35.96 --> 01:16:42.76
leather and it took a while to get it right I mean it's you gotta remember like leather like text

869
01:16:42.76 --> 01:16:48.52
styles depending on how it's tanned it can be you know it can stretch more be more rigid and not

870
01:16:48.52 --> 01:16:55.56
form right it can wrinkle you know there's all sorts of shit that can happen that that's really bad so

871
01:16:55.56 --> 01:16:59.88
anyways we have to get through all of that and we have to get through that and make sure the patterns

872
01:16:59.88 --> 01:17:08.68
were right and then we ordered the dies and we started cutting and it was wrong because

873
01:17:08.68 --> 01:17:18.28
we had graded them from the 14's so we may have lost 10 or 15 grand on dies I know but

874
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:29.72
but we we reordered the dies and now we've got them working but yeah so we have probably 500

875
01:17:29.72 --> 01:17:35.40
pairs cut ready ready to go and we lean many facts out the line and we're in the process of

876
01:17:35.40 --> 01:17:41.64
training the young folks now we have a young girl Nikki she's 19 another guy who's in there

877
01:17:41.64 --> 01:17:46.44
Christine and Henry those two combined experience like 80 years you know the little way

878
01:17:46.44 --> 01:17:52.68
stitches telling you about and Henry and we're like literally once you and I have a conversation like

879
01:17:52.68 --> 01:17:59.08
hey we should we turn it on we'll just turn it on we'll turn it on and we need to turn it on

880
01:17:59.08 --> 01:18:03.56
in the factory right now before we move it you know to the new plan because it's got it's got to work

881
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:08.76
there first we've got to have the proof of the concept worked out but man I put I put a ton of

882
01:18:08.76 --> 01:18:15.40
miles on those boots and man they're wearing in nicely yeah nicely so it's it's a classic

883
01:18:16.04 --> 01:18:22.12
it's what boots it's like boots that's what they are their boots boots man you know what they

884
01:18:22.12 --> 01:18:28.04
go well with jeans yeah I love the fact that we like we we're calling the jeans legit fit

885
01:18:28.04 --> 01:18:35.96
you know now while we're doing all this meanwhile I'm out starting jockel publishing you know

886
01:18:35.96 --> 01:18:42.12
I have a I'm like hey man by the way I've got you know whatever I'm gonna be I got 100,000 books

887
01:18:42.12 --> 01:18:48.04
that you know I'm gonna need to get moved from place to place we have a fulfillment center

888
01:18:48.04 --> 01:18:52.52
like you're like yes we do and boom all of a sudden next you know we we got a fulfillment center we got

889
01:18:52.52 --> 01:18:58.92
the warrior kid three we got Mikey the Dragons there you're we just absorb that it was like

890
01:18:58.92 --> 01:19:05.56
it was one of those things that I'll give me the freedom to tell my publisher watch this on

891
01:19:05.56 --> 01:19:09.72
publishing you know I got a publishing company now watch this and to have the freedom to be able to

892
01:19:09.72 --> 01:19:15.64
do that was phenomenal because I knew I was like okay well I can make this happen because they're

893
01:19:15.64 --> 01:19:21.000
looking at it going how the hell where where are you gonna we're gonna store 100,000 books how

894
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.64
you gonna politicize books who's gonna you we jocke or you're gonna be in a warehouse somewhere

895
01:19:25.64 --> 01:19:29.16
palatizing books you know while you're trying to write another book and do all the other stuff

896
01:19:29.16 --> 01:19:32.36
that you're doing that's not gonna work so they're in the back of their mind they're thinking

897
01:19:32.36 --> 01:19:37.96
I'm an idiot yeah thinking it's impossible which is which is a common theme around here people think

898
01:19:37.96 --> 01:19:42.84
things are impossible and you know I there's another thing I was saying the other day and you were

899
01:19:42.84 --> 01:19:49.000
that you kind of reminded me of this of when you started down the path of hey I'm gonna make

900
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.84
keys here and I'll put something they're telling you people are telling you it's impossible to do this

901
01:19:54.84 --> 01:20:02.20
some people are possible to do this and the reason that that that that that that propaganda is out there

902
01:20:02.20 --> 01:20:09.24
is because the big corporations the best answer that they can give to the American people and they say

903
01:20:09.24 --> 01:20:13.56
hey why are you shutting down this factory the best answer that they can give us oh it's impossible

904
01:20:13.56 --> 01:20:19.48
to manufacture here that's what it is it's impossible to manufacture here that's their answer that

905
01:20:19.48 --> 01:20:27.72
way they can save an extra 32 cents per item by having it manufactured in China where they

906
01:20:27.72 --> 01:20:32.44
where they they still have to pay shipping they still have to pay customs they have to pay to get it

907
01:20:32.44 --> 01:20:37.16
over there's all kinds of but it's not like they're saying it's not like all those laborers

908
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:44.68
only get a dollar a day so therefore we're saving 80 or whatever 12 dollars an item no they're actually

909
01:20:44.68 --> 01:20:49.72
we'll all be at the costs they're saving 32 cents an item by paying somebody over there a dollar

910
01:20:49.72 --> 01:20:54.84
a day and by taking a job from an American sending it overseas so the best answer that they can

911
01:20:54.84 --> 01:20:59.40
can give isn't well we want to make an extra 32 cents an item the best answer that they can give

912
01:20:59.40 --> 01:21:07.000
is this is impossible to do here can't manufacture in American anymore that's what that's what

913
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.48
we are being told we're being lied to America's being lied to and I honestly feel because of the

914
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:20.68
podcast I feel like you've made what we're doing and main the tip of the spear I mean and main

915
01:21:20.68 --> 01:21:25.56
is shaped like the tip of the spear which is even more badass and it is old school in the

916
01:21:25.56 --> 01:21:33.24
England it is which is even more badass but it's not impossible and like if you look at like

917
01:21:33.24 --> 01:21:37.80
we're here at the immersion camp I was sitting down with a woman she's in California we're

918
01:21:37.80 --> 01:21:42.20
sitting on the side of the mat she's from California she's a cop and she's just talking to

919
01:21:42.20 --> 01:21:47.56
me about her struggles about media and how they're making her out to be and her you know and

920
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:54.44
folks in law enforcement and everything and and she said you know she's like what happened and I

921
01:21:54.44 --> 01:22:02.52
said and just clicked I'm sitting here looking at this mat full of 100 200 people from all

922
01:22:02.52 --> 01:22:15.08
different creeds skin colors backgrounds jobs from farmers to huge businessmen scientists

923
01:22:15.08 --> 01:22:24.84
to surgeons all on the mats for a common goal to train and learn jiu jitsu isn't that what

924
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:32.84
America is together for a common goal isn't that how this country was built isn't that how New England

925
01:22:32.84 --> 01:22:40.92
was established when the immigrants came in together for a common goal and it's literally happening

926
01:22:40.92 --> 01:22:47.16
right in front of me and I just I just connected into it and I was just like what what's missing

927
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:55.56
well I can see here that this is all about minds and hands right jiu jitsu you know learning jiu jitsu

928
01:22:55.56 --> 01:23:00.84
it's not hard it's hard on your mind it's hard on your body it's hard on your hands you know

929
01:23:00.84 --> 01:23:06.20
and and manufacturing is is the same thing it's it's the same thing and and just

930
01:23:09.24 --> 01:23:15.40
understanding like and I know you know you're from Maine and Connecticut and New England and we both

931
01:23:15.40 --> 01:23:22.76
are and understanding where we came from and what was sacrificed so that we could get here

932
01:23:22.76 --> 01:23:29.64
I feel like we've abandoned that you know and I feel like jiu jitsu is like a spark you know looking

933
01:23:29.64 --> 01:23:35.32
at those matches like the spark like whoa wait a second I bet there's every type of political

934
01:23:35.32 --> 01:23:41.80
affiliation on the mats right now yeah for sure I've got unbelievable that these people are here

935
01:23:41.80 --> 01:23:51.000
smiling and just and just sheer enjoyment maybe jiu jitsu can solve the world's problems

936
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.84
and I don't know but but I do feel like we've abandoned so much well also when you take a kid

937
01:23:59.80 --> 01:24:06.60
and your kid says hey I want to do this and you tell him you can't do that what does that do the

938
01:24:06.60 --> 01:24:14.92
kid what does that do the kids kids well that's what we're out right now you can't do this you can't

939
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:20.84
do this in America and another thing is when it's like I want to build something you can't do it

940
01:24:21.88 --> 01:24:29.72
think about that you can't do it and that isn't attitude that used to not even remotely

941
01:24:29.72 --> 01:24:35.24
exist in America we were busy putting men on the moon and building the best cars and the best

942
01:24:35.24 --> 01:24:42.52
ships and the best planes in the world and winning wars and getting after it and all of a

943
01:24:42.52 --> 01:24:47.08
sudden we're looking around going oh you can't you the what's the fundamental for all that stuff

944
01:24:47.08 --> 01:24:52.12
built built built something and all of a sudden you're being told you can't build something

945
01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:03.72
the oh you have to manufacture overseas they manufacture better no no this is our blood we build things

946
01:25:03.72 --> 01:25:09.64
and when you take that away from someone what do they got it's wrong it's just wrong

947
01:25:10.84 --> 01:25:17.56
so I actually I actually like a little bit of the propaganda it just helps what we're doing

948
01:25:18.76 --> 01:25:26.20
we can just sneak up behind these folks and choke them out yeah the and it doesn't stop there

949
01:25:26.20 --> 01:25:31.64
we're going we're in a war on all fronts you know we got on top of all this we got origin labs

950
01:25:31.64 --> 01:25:39.80
yeah and we've put out tons of of new products and origin labs from but you know whatever

951
01:25:39.80 --> 01:25:45.000
being echo talk about that all the time the new products and new products but from a business perspective

952
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:53.88
I think one of the biggest challenges has been the go ready to drink in a can again

953
01:25:53.88 --> 01:26:04.36
it was one of these things where hey we want to make a drink that gives you energy but is not

954
01:26:04.36 --> 01:26:12.44
freaking horrible for you yeah which which which may seem like that's impossible that's impossible

955
01:26:12.44 --> 01:26:17.96
because you need it to taste good so it's got a have sugar you got to have it not be refrigerated

956
01:26:17.96 --> 01:26:22.84
so it's got to be have a bunch of chemicals in it to keep it from going spoiled and then you got to

957
01:26:22.84 --> 01:26:29.56
put 8 billion grams of caffeine in it so at least convinces a person that's drinking 10 billion

958
01:26:29.56 --> 01:26:35.72
and grams of caffeine a day that this is actually hitting them so it's all these hey that won't

959
01:26:35.72 --> 01:26:42.60
work no no no and that was the first thing how do we actually make something that I could look

960
01:26:42.60 --> 01:26:48.28
at a person and be like you should drink this it is good for you to drink this it will help you

961
01:26:48.28 --> 01:26:54.76
in your life and your brain and your athletic pursuits right now that's a big step it is

962
01:26:54.76 --> 01:27:00.68
you know and what's funny is like I remember the last conversation before we actually pulled

963
01:27:00.68 --> 01:27:07.88
the trigger on making a decision and you were like I'm not compromising we're changing the category

964
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.56
like this is poison you know the this category the energy treatment category the energy

965
01:27:13.56 --> 01:27:20.04
treatment category it's just straight poison and we're not conforming to the standard and you

966
01:27:20.04 --> 01:27:25.08
you made like it it's going to be as far as the caffeine thing when you kind of set that bar

967
01:27:25.80 --> 01:27:32.36
like I was I was on board you know and and I you know the thing is it's like I'm not a big

968
01:27:32.36 --> 01:27:39.64
caffeine drinker but and I know you're not a big caffeine drinker but literally like I would never

969
01:27:39.64 --> 01:27:46.28
ever allow my kids to get an energy drink are you kidding me yeah ever I think if I gave my kid an

970
01:27:46.28 --> 01:27:52.68
energy drink there would be mayhem in the world mayhem yeah so you know I mean just just being

971
01:27:52.68 --> 01:27:56.44
able to make that decision we're not going to conform and we're not going to compromise you know

972
01:27:56.44 --> 01:28:04.36
I mean that that started the challenge you know but and the other big one was was how do we

973
01:28:04.36 --> 01:28:12.28
make these things stay fresh right out the normal chemicals that they add to all these drinks

974
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.92
that keep them fresh to keep them for being spoiled and we're like let's do what they do with

975
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:23.72
my mood milk pasteurizing pasteurization and so how many other drinks are there that you go

976
01:28:23.72 --> 01:28:29.08
into a store or you order or you pop open a can and it's pasteurized what's the number of drinks

977
01:28:29.08 --> 01:28:35.80
like that I think the number is zero yeah the number is zero again what's the what's the business

978
01:28:35.80 --> 01:28:41.24
decision the business decision well it's going to cost a lot more yeah it's going to cost a lot more

979
01:28:41.24 --> 01:28:48.20
to pasteurize these things it's going to cost a lot more to use monk fruit instead of whatever

980
01:28:48.20 --> 01:28:53.96
the freaking cancer carcinogens that they just pump into those things no we're going to use the best

981
01:28:53.96 --> 01:29:00.60
ingredients so all those little decisions along the way hey we could be wrong actually we could be wrong

982
01:29:00.60 --> 01:29:05.48
I'm it's worth the tuition payment I was going to say if we're wrong at least I'll be able to sleep

983
01:29:05.48 --> 01:29:11.64
exactly and I think that's what when you're distilled it down that's what it that's what you get right

984
01:29:11.64 --> 01:29:16.60
is you know you can cut corners in the way you start at this you can cut corners here there the other

985
01:29:16.60 --> 01:29:22.36
place but what is the right thing to do you know like with the genes what's the right thing to do

986
01:29:22.36 --> 01:29:25.64
well build the product that's going to last lifetime that's actually the right thing to do that

987
01:29:25.64 --> 01:29:30.84
will never fall apart right and it's the same thing with with all the nutritional stuff because

988
01:29:30.84 --> 01:29:37.000
there's so much junk and you know my son's 16 I will only let him take malt for protein or

989
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.68
reward kid either one of those I'll let him take I'll let him touch any of that other shit he's

990
01:29:40.68 --> 01:29:46.52
going to be 17 my daughter's turned 14 you know it's like there's things they're exposed to and

991
01:29:46.52 --> 01:29:55.24
there's propaganda in this industry pushing this poison at kids and honestly like they're at the

992
01:29:55.24 --> 01:30:01.08
point where they're mobile you know I know your son's mobile too where they're making decisions

993
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:09.72
stopping at the store grabbing things to drink grabbing snacks and I actually I'm on them all the time

994
01:30:09.72 --> 01:30:14.36
what'd you eat today what'd you pick up at the store what'd you drink today you know I'm on

995
01:30:14.36 --> 01:30:19.80
them about it because they know how important it is to me that they make good choices

996
01:30:20.76 --> 01:30:27.24
with the occasional you know double cheeseburger at my dogs which I may partake in once in a while

997
01:30:28.52 --> 01:30:37.72
but yeah there is a you don't usually find that in in the categories and in this industry

998
01:30:37.72 --> 01:30:41.56
in the nutritional you know you just you find people looking at those things and

999
01:30:41.56 --> 01:30:51.88
I think that ultimately ultimately honestly without your podcast I think it would be almost impossible

1000
01:30:52.76 --> 01:31:01.24
I think it would be almost impossible without without you explaining the people what's going on here

1001
01:31:01.24 --> 01:31:05.48
well then you might as well have said it's not really the podcast to people that are listening to the podcast

1002
01:31:05.48 --> 01:31:10.20
sure it's not me it's the people that are listening to podcasts that go okay yep

1003
01:31:10.20 --> 01:31:17.48
we're on board that's what it is yeah and so thanks to everyone that listens to this podcast

1004
01:31:18.04 --> 01:31:23.88
because otherwise we wouldn't be doing much of what we're doing right now no absolutely I mean

1005
01:31:23.88 --> 01:31:29.16
did you get all these like you know these Netflix specials and stuff you know and like what makes you

1006
01:31:29.16 --> 01:31:35.000
fat or like the truth about sugar you know or you know all these things there's all these new

1007
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.64
so there's there is kind of awakening I guess I would call it and awakening about what you're

1008
01:31:41.64 --> 01:31:47.24
putting in your body it's happening it's happening and I think you're a part of that awakening I

1009
01:31:47.24 --> 01:31:52.04
think you're a big part of that awakening letting people know hey you got to watch what you're

1010
01:31:52.04 --> 01:31:58.28
putting in your body but I'm gonna make something that I want to put in my body you know and I

1011
01:31:58.28 --> 01:32:02.76
think that's a you know that value proposition that you'd sound reliable you know it's

1012
01:32:02.76 --> 01:32:07.40
undeniable and we're not gonna compromise on that that's undeniable and if it doesn't work out at

1013
01:32:07.40 --> 01:32:12.20
least we did the right thing that's undeniable yeah it's like chasing the truck back to the cotton field

1014
01:32:12.20 --> 01:32:18.20
that's where you're gonna end up so you can't argue with it yeah I think it's the right decision

1015
01:32:18.20 --> 01:32:24.76
my wife the other day I came home and she says do you have a vitamin exponder or like a high

1016
01:32:24.76 --> 01:32:30.12
speed blender do you have those young blend tech is it okay one of those like big high speed

1017
01:32:30.12 --> 01:32:35.64
blenders oh like the ninja I don't know but it's a big like it's almost like an industrial blender

1018
01:32:36.28 --> 01:32:41.24
okay so I have one of those and the other day but I normally don't use it because I just use a

1019
01:32:41.24 --> 01:32:47.000
shaker cup right when I'm making some milk of whatever flavor so and everyone in my family just

1020
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000
uses a shaker cup occasionally someone decides to kick in the the the Vitamix so I come home the other

1021
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
day and my wife goes you know she's like oh hi hi and then she says I had strawberry milk

1022
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.32
in the Vitamix and I said and and she said she said this it's the best thing I've ever tasted

1023
01:33:07.32 --> 01:33:16.04
in my life so my wife said she is seriously and you know she just she said it was so frothy

1024
01:33:16.04 --> 01:33:24.60
so frothy so frothy and I said what did you have it she goes just milk and milk strawberry milk

1025
01:33:24.60 --> 01:33:31.96
and when I saw it because my wife you know she's a she's a world a worldly person I guess you know

1026
01:33:31.96 --> 01:33:38.52
she likes to kind of find pallet and she likes different kinds of things I'm not that right

1027
01:33:38.52 --> 01:33:44.52
for me to be like this tastes good that has limited merit right can I share the wooden sword

1028
01:33:44.52 --> 01:33:51.16
thing the wooden sword was wooden sword that's so I can I can help assist painting the picture

1029
01:33:51.16 --> 01:33:56.04
of Helen go ahead we're in your like hey we need to build a wooden sword we're on the phone

1030
01:33:56.04 --> 01:34:01.08
of the day oh we need to build a wood sword we need to build a wood sword do like a special for

1031
01:34:01.08 --> 01:34:06.60
for my king the dragon's little wooden sword and I wouldn't shield in the back interaction

1032
01:34:06.60 --> 01:34:15.000
jocco that's about barbed wire I died laughing that's barbaric because I want a little

1033
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.40
kids to have shields and swords and wooden which is not so much we just like the only thing I

1034
01:34:19.40 --> 01:34:24.28
played with until I figured out that there was a machine gun then I had a machine gun right

1035
01:34:24.28 --> 01:34:28.04
what did you think is a great idea for we should do that for like this Christmas or something like

1036
01:34:28.04 --> 01:34:33.80
build wooden swords with a mic and a dragon shield yeah if it would dragon on it yeah be bad

1037
01:34:33.80 --> 01:34:39.96
attitude if I was a kid and I got that yes I'd be chopping at everything yes I don't know that

1038
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:46.12
because I mean we had wooden swords as kids yeah but and then they turned them into foam yeah I was

1039
01:34:46.12 --> 01:34:51.40
gonna say that's the thing is now they may come from because then you can't hurt anybody which I get

1040
01:34:51.96 --> 01:34:57.88
maybe you need to maybe need to parent your kids and say hey Billy don't hit Jennifer

1041
01:34:57.88 --> 01:35:04.84
in the head with a wooden sword like don't do that it's called parenting let's try it or you just

1042
01:35:04.84 --> 01:35:09.32
put a helmet on him and put foam everything put him in a padded room and now we don't have to worry

1043
01:35:09.32 --> 01:35:18.52
about it you don't have it anymore so shit all that stuff together I mean it's it's growth

1044
01:35:18.84 --> 01:35:26.60
right now when you look at the growth right now I mean do you see any hesitation in the growth

1045
01:35:27.48 --> 01:35:33.32
zero do you see acceleration in the growth yes are you are you nervous

1046
01:35:33.32 --> 01:35:42.76
I think I I don't know if nervous is the right word you know I mean number one I love the process

1047
01:35:43.56 --> 01:35:50.52
and I hope the process never stops I don't I mean to think of something ending like what we're

1048
01:35:50.52 --> 01:35:55.72
doing I just you know I say well you really have four decades of opportunity and I've told you

1049
01:35:55.72 --> 01:36:02.20
this before you know one of my advisors John I have to introduce you to you next time we're farming

1050
01:36:02.20 --> 01:36:08.12
ten said hey hey you've got four decades of opportunity you know your first 20 years you're learning

1051
01:36:08.12 --> 01:36:13.40
you've got 40 years to do and then hopefully you enjoy the fruits of your labor you know and

1052
01:36:13.40 --> 01:36:20.68
and I'm in I'm in the second decade right 20 to 30 30 to 40 turn 40 February second decade like

1053
01:36:21.56 --> 01:36:27.96
the process man the process is what gives me excited being in the game you know not standing

1054
01:36:27.96 --> 01:36:34.60
on the sidelines not being a former player watching you know the new blood play you know I love

1055
01:36:34.60 --> 01:36:40.68
being in the game you know and and I think that to be in the game you're gonna be a little bit

1056
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:45.40
nervous you're gonna have butterflies because that's what being part of the team is that's

1057
01:36:45.40 --> 01:36:51.80
what being in the game means and if you know and if you don't have that then you you're arrogant

1058
01:36:51.80 --> 01:36:58.68
and or maybe you're complacent right but if you're in the game you've got to feel that thing that's

1059
01:36:58.68 --> 01:37:05.96
driving you to get up every morning you know and and I love it I love it you know that's

1060
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:15.16
truly my passion is being in the game not what the not not winning the game not winning the

1061
01:37:15.16 --> 01:37:22.60
championship not looking to to an end goal like if we achieve this we've won you know it's it's just

1062
01:37:23.24 --> 01:37:27.96
it's just if we achieve this what can we do next exactly where can we go from there exactly

1063
01:37:28.52 --> 01:37:35.80
I look at one thing that I like doing and I like being a part of and one thing that I like

1064
01:37:35.80 --> 01:37:46.04
about working with you is it doesn't seem like I can say hey I think we need to do this and I know

1065
01:37:46.04 --> 01:37:53.08
that it it's gonna be really really hard but we can do it and you're like oh yes we can you know

1066
01:37:53.08 --> 01:37:59.000
as opposed to the nine reasons or the twelve reasons or the forty seven reasons why

1067
01:37:59.64 --> 01:38:02.84
well you know there's this problem there's that problem there's that problem

1068
01:38:02.84 --> 01:38:10.28
I never I never hear that from you I know you don't hear it from me it's hey this is where

1069
01:38:10.28 --> 01:38:18.12
we're at this seems like it would be crazy to do let's do it yes here's how we can make it happen

1070
01:38:19.64 --> 01:38:28.60
yeah and to touch on that and the fact that there has been this propaganda delivered to our minds

1071
01:38:28.60 --> 01:38:35.64
over the past twenty thirty years whatever it's been I was talking to a woman recently and she's

1072
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:41.24
the one that saved that first alone when when the Chinese came in and they purchased up this

1073
01:38:41.24 --> 01:38:45.48
mill when loosened and made and they pulled everything out she saved this loom I had her on my podcast

1074
01:38:45.48 --> 01:38:55.96
actually and it's Rachel and the biggest thing that that built the infrastructure for the New England

1075
01:38:55.96 --> 01:39:03.80
mills were the canal systems and if you pulled the stones out of like the canal system in

1076
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:10.04
Lewiston you could build another great pyramid if you pulled the granite out of these canal

1077
01:39:10.04 --> 01:39:16.84
systems you could build another great pyramid think about what they did a hundred years ago

1078
01:39:16.84 --> 01:39:23.88
in Lewiston Maine they built a great pyramid in the form of a canal system and they did it

1079
01:39:23.88 --> 01:39:30.84
without technology they couldn't look up leg twist in jeans and solve the problem right we can

1080
01:39:31.24 --> 01:39:36.60
so to say it can't be done I'd never say that we've got technology we've still got people that

1081
01:39:36.60 --> 01:39:42.28
know we've got jets that can get us you know you can jump in on a jet blue flight and get to Europe

1082
01:39:42.28 --> 01:39:47.56
in eight hours or twelve hours if you need to go see how something works or if I need to go to

1083
01:39:47.56 --> 01:39:52.60
California if I need to just drive to low Massachusetts I mean you have the opportunity to travel

1084
01:39:52.60 --> 01:39:58.20
quickly you're not getting on a boat on the ocean and that's what they were doing they were transporting

1085
01:39:58.20 --> 01:40:04.04
this stuff with horse and buggy on rails across the ocean and you're telling me it's impossible

1086
01:40:04.84 --> 01:40:13.48
are you freaking kidding me this is the easiest time we've ever had to do this and that's why it's

1087
01:40:13.48 --> 01:40:20.60
not crazy because of what we do have we're fortunate to be in a day and age where we can get

1088
01:40:20.60 --> 01:40:26.28
information like that you know it's just a matter of putting hands and dirt that's what people are

1089
01:40:26.28 --> 01:40:33.56
scared of you know they don't know how good calluses feel if they did and it'd be a different

1090
01:40:33.56 --> 01:40:41.96
it'd be a different world right now so again fortunate and and being in New England being in

1091
01:40:41.96 --> 01:40:50.84
this part of of Maine knowing that that feeling may have been abandoned or the people may have been

1092
01:40:50.84 --> 01:40:58.52
abandoned and showing him no you haven't been abandoned actually this is cyclical and we know that

1093
01:40:58.52 --> 01:41:04.84
we're still the best at this let's just make it happen again let's get back in the game let's get back

1094
01:41:04.84 --> 01:41:13.16
on the field let's make it happen again just being part of that let's get to work let's get to work awesome

1095
01:41:14.44 --> 01:41:20.04
seems like a good place to wrap it up echo Charles yes how's it going over there pretty cool

1096
01:41:20.04 --> 01:41:27.16
speaking of getting to work yeah we like to work in various various modalities yeah I've never heard

1097
01:41:27.16 --> 01:41:34.04
that word really modalities yeah and I love expanding vocabulary explain it to me different modes

1098
01:41:34.04 --> 01:41:39.88
different modes yeah modality different modalities one modality might be we want to get smarter

1099
01:41:40.60 --> 01:41:47.40
right we want to train our brain right we want to train our our our a real bit capacity sure we want

1100
01:41:47.40 --> 01:41:56.20
to train our defensive capabilities yes we want to train our strength we want to train our reflexes

1101
01:41:57.56 --> 01:42:01.24
I mean we're just want to train in a bunch of different modalities do you know anything that really

1102
01:42:01.24 --> 01:42:07.64
helps across a broad spectrum spectrum of modalities like that echo Charles yes and what would that be

1103
01:42:07.64 --> 01:42:13.24
well one is jiu jitsu what the energy and immersion cap immersing immersing our self right that's

1104
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:17.96
the word right immersing yes yeah immersing ourselves you know everybody's ripped off immersion camp now

1105
01:42:18.60 --> 01:42:24.92
oh really oh yeah yeah yeah yeah all the the who's who of jiu jitsu were doing immersion camps okay

1106
01:42:24.92 --> 01:42:30.12
yeah well good flattering that's awesome yeah no it's also more people are training yeah immersing

1107
01:42:30.12 --> 01:42:36.60
themselves in jiu jitsu because yes very useful as a modality of improvement for sure

1108
01:42:37.48 --> 01:42:43.40
mental physical anyway we're here vocabulary vocabulary modality is vocabulary modality

1109
01:42:43.40 --> 01:42:46.68
well I'm just saying we are apparently we're improving our vocabulary tonight across the board

1110
01:42:46.68 --> 01:42:53.88
yes using immersive modality immersive modality yeah yes yeah so you know you talk about the new

1111
01:42:53.88 --> 01:42:59.96
riff-gui I agree 100% every element that you brought up 100% echo I'm going to interrupt you

1112
01:43:00.28 --> 01:43:05.88

1114
01:43:16.20 --> 01:43:24.84
ge when you got here yes you know who else got those gees yeah juggle what do you mean what

1117
01:43:39.40 --> 01:43:43.96
peripheral vision would you know by the way you wouldn't have known wasn't what was about the

1118
01:43:43.96 --> 01:43:53.72
happy juggle right there yeah yeah yeah this was he was concerned yeah he goes if I give

1119
01:43:53.72 --> 01:43:58.12
echo this do you think he's gonna know and I was like no I'll just think that it's the

1120
01:43:58.12 --> 01:44:02.36
camp gear something yeah oh me back oh got his black belt by the way for anyone that's listening

1121
01:44:02.36 --> 01:44:08.60
that didn't hear this yet we'll do a whole podcast about that we we made 15 blackies for the

1122
01:44:08.60 --> 01:44:13.64
expert the black belt experts you being wonderful yeah and speak holy stuff thank you

1123
01:44:13.64 --> 01:44:17.80
come on don't leave you hand so cool so cool and it's funny because it's like you

1124
01:44:17.80 --> 01:44:21.24
to and you know juggle told me a few other things you know this and it's like you know

1125
01:44:21.24 --> 01:44:25.96
like when you watch fight club you know here watch I'm a little bit too much you know like you're

1126
01:44:25.96 --> 01:44:31.08
like oh I didn't want to look at you oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and you know at the end of

1127
01:44:31.08 --> 01:44:35.40
fight club this is big like you know what he called you yes right then you watch it again you're like

1128
01:44:35.40 --> 01:44:40.12
oh I see all the little bit that same you start connecting stuff I'm experiencing right now

1129
01:44:40.12 --> 01:44:46.68
if you guys don't the last we talked about the riff key black or otherwise that is a reinvented

1130
01:44:46.68 --> 01:44:52.92
scenario right there yeah really good and the thing is I do prefered no key over key but then

1131
01:44:52.92 --> 01:44:57.96
after even that other one the other the one that I got because I got a riffed in another one that

1132
01:44:57.96 --> 01:45:02.84
looks it looks different but it's different but it's also it's the same material yeah yeah yeah

1133
01:45:02.84 --> 01:45:07.32
that was special we yeah yeah it's a special thing the same material the same

1134
01:45:07.32 --> 01:45:12.36
same material the dragon we've gently we've gently we've just yeah I think that's the primary

1135
01:45:12.36 --> 01:45:18.68
mover in that key feeling so good yes I get that the cut is also a factor yeah but the bigger

1136
01:45:18.68 --> 01:45:25.64
factor that's that material the textiles ridiculous well because like I'd say like dries as you sweat

1137
01:45:25.64 --> 01:45:30.04
yeah that's a weird thing and you can put it in the you can it's dry it's basically dry

1138
01:45:30.04 --> 01:45:35.88
when you get done with the spin cycle final spin yeah yeah final slint layers when you get done with

1139
01:45:35.88 --> 01:45:41.64
that then it's almost dry right then you could you could put it on the mat so that's it for anyone

1140
01:45:41.64 --> 01:45:49.000
that had a knee before like in five years people be like oh yeah used to suck you staff to like

1141
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.20
dry these things for eighty minutes to get dry now everyone's gonna be oh that was to be horrible

1142
01:45:54.20 --> 01:46:00.28
you know it was like oh when I was a kid I used to have the phones were attached to the wall

1143
01:46:00.28 --> 01:46:04.92
oh people like oh that's very horrible you know there's like oh I used to get my gear in the

1144
01:46:04.92 --> 01:46:09.32
dryer for an hour and a half to get it dry oh that must have been horrible now we can

1145
01:46:09.32 --> 01:46:15.000
trim it into the softening of society by making no we can trim more now it's true there we go more

1146
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:21.72
jack you got saving power it's it's green right that's green yeah yeah to get a rift key

1147
01:46:21.72 --> 01:46:26.92
yeah it's in there so yeah green there to get to unless it makes me want want to do more ghee

1148
01:46:26.92 --> 01:46:31.40
just that little push and I think that's something this is what this is not what you have

1149
01:46:31.40 --> 01:46:36.84
someone that is very focused on comfort a little extra comfort goes along with that

1150
01:46:36.84 --> 01:46:43.64
you're just so if anyone's wondering which they aren't I would assume they are not wondering

1151
01:46:43.64 --> 01:46:48.60
what get you get you get an origin geek it's not just the rift it's a whole spectrum

1152
01:46:48.60 --> 01:46:53.40
while you're here okay I'm gonna give you some scenarios I just started you Jitsu I'm not looking

1153
01:46:53.40 --> 01:47:00.52
to compete I'm gonna train three times a week my budget is tight what ghee should I get I would go

1154
01:47:00.52 --> 01:47:06.44
with a comp ethletta okay which is still gonna give you the performance or we have that warrior

1155
01:47:06.44 --> 01:47:10.60
line which is a lightweight ghee but it's it's more built for warmer environments you know the

1156
01:47:10.60 --> 01:47:17.48
comp ethletta really is the right ghee to go okay yeah I'm I'm training six times a week

1157
01:47:17.48 --> 01:47:27.48
I'm gonna compete I have a tight budget six times a week you want to compete tight budget

1158
01:47:27.48 --> 01:47:32.76
I'd still go with a comp ethletta okay at what point do I step up and get a rift

1159
01:47:32.76 --> 01:47:48.12
at what point do you want to improve I'm gonna tell you honestly right now if my budget was

1160
01:47:48.12 --> 01:47:55.40
tight I would wait an extra two months and get a rift yeah it's a game changer product you know it's

1161
01:47:55.40 --> 01:48:02.36
not it's hard to explain man like it like when you're underneath somebody you know like we're

1162
01:48:02.36 --> 01:48:05.72
an old ghee let's say you're underneath somebody inside control you've been sweating the whole

1163
01:48:05.72 --> 01:48:11.96
match your 10 minutes in and you need to like elbow escape or hip out and your arms stuck inside

1164
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:18.52
the sleeve because of the abrasion of the the text what you're gonna feel is free you know so it

1165
01:48:18.52 --> 01:48:23.72
gives you an advantage in that regard if you want to feel free on the mats even when you're

1166
01:48:23.72 --> 01:48:30.52
getting crushed and smothered get a rift all right it's an advantage it's it's a way to cheat the

1167
01:48:30.52 --> 01:48:36.76
system yeah okay yeah it's a whole comprehensive it's a whole period yeah yeah exactly like the

1168
01:48:36.76 --> 01:48:41.000
reason you're like no ghee so much is you like that right the freedom of movement and everything

1169
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.04
and you know it's almost provides that for you you know we need to engage your version of covering

1170
01:48:46.04 --> 01:48:53.56
up his arms as well well because it's a massive yeah all right also we got what we just

1171
01:48:53.56 --> 01:49:01.88
talked about jeans or jeans order those up we got t-shirts we got other clothes and we got

1172
01:49:01.88 --> 01:49:06.36
supplements take it yeah all the different supplements yeah so I had I got the new

1173
01:49:07.48 --> 01:49:14.60
which we haven't talked about yet cold or yeah yeah is that for a reason or we just now we're

1174
01:49:14.60 --> 01:49:21.40
talking about it now okay boom so I got some that cold cold war krill oil joint warfare good snack

1175
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:27.56
these are like the the the pre requisite supplements this is like to keep you in the game like

1176
01:49:27.56 --> 01:49:33.48
it doesn't matter you can have you can have huge strength all this stuff but you if you can't

1177
01:49:33.48 --> 01:49:37.48
keep yourself in the game like if you're on the sideline because injuries whatever you're not

1178
01:49:37.48 --> 01:49:43.000
moving correctly you're sick all this stuff doesn't even matter so anyway I had that line

1179
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.40
I had it dawned on me how these are the most important supplements that there are in my opinion

1180
01:49:49.40 --> 01:49:53.80
yeah because without them you could possibly not be in the game yeah you can be the strongest

1181
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:59.40
guy but you're not even in the game you know you can't roll because whatever your neck is sore

1182
01:49:59.40 --> 01:50:05.16
it's a whole lot of the joint warfare and I'm almost ready to go there you go you know you

1183
01:50:05.16 --> 01:50:10.76
did to chocolate we were telling you how the cold the cold war came to be because he was getting

1184
01:50:10.76 --> 01:50:16.12
off the airplane or something or you were traveling a lot yeah just what I'm like guys

1185
01:50:16.12 --> 01:50:22.60
there was almost got sick I need like a hyper boost of you know all the stuff that prevents

1186
01:50:22.60 --> 01:50:28.68
you from getting sick yeah and Brian's like cool let me pull me figure it out yeah we ran it

1187
01:50:28.68 --> 01:50:34.92
and then I tested it and I'm like okay I've been traveling whatever it was six weeks no sickness

1188
01:50:34.92 --> 01:50:40.28
that's like when I say sick you know you you know when you travel in the just like your nose

1189
01:50:40.84 --> 01:50:45.16
you just you just like wake up your mouth tastes like crap yeah you feel like you're about to

1190
01:50:45.16 --> 01:50:50.36
get sick yeah that I got like that yeah I don't like that it's pulling you maybe not out of the

1191
01:50:50.36 --> 01:50:56.20
game but it's infringing on the game it's kind of jamming fringy yeah for infringement oh yeah

1192
01:50:56.20 --> 01:51:05.000
so there's all that stuff also what mook mook look to say you don't need mook um okay maybe

1193
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:12.28
maybe that but you kind of need mook so that seems like that is the greatest name ever mook yes

1194
01:51:12.28 --> 01:51:20.84
I mean it's you know there's this borderline you know like just you know we were talking the other day

1195
01:51:20.84 --> 01:51:29.08
about this borderline genius oh yeah just the worst idea on the planet yeah mook is in the genius

1196
01:51:29.08 --> 01:51:36.84
got to go right you know what I mean I mean it's it's it's genius mook yeah it's uh it's fitting

1197
01:51:36.84 --> 01:51:46.68
and it it is inspired by mook itself yeah mook came first and then mook came you know you

1198
01:51:46.68 --> 01:51:52.52
are in the the drink came yeah and it was so good I remember telling you guys this is not a

1199
01:51:52.52 --> 01:51:58.52
pro this is not a protein just like a protein yeah this isn't a meal replacement right this is

1200
01:51:58.52 --> 01:52:09.88
it's own thing and and it's taste to me like mook I think the influences in there for me

1201
01:52:09.88 --> 01:52:16.28
were the monk fruit yeah right mook mook right and then kind of like Hulk right because I knew

1202
01:52:16.28 --> 01:52:23.000
we're going to mint green and then of course motorhead mook over the oh because that's just legit

1203
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:30.76
yeah and they asked lemme why he put the umla over oh in motorhead and he said because it look cool

1204
01:52:30.76 --> 01:52:34.84
like that was his answer all right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1205
01:52:34.84 --> 01:52:39.48
there's the full story on it that's the full story umla umla I thought so it's not an emulet

1206
01:52:40.12 --> 01:52:45.40
is that a different emulet umla umla and emulet is not like somebody where around you're

1207
01:52:45.40 --> 01:52:54.12
yeah like a little thing I thought that those crystals and emulets maybe no umla umla yeah that's

1208
01:52:54.12 --> 01:52:59.40
funny you're like and when you do it put put put the umla above it put the two dots I was like

1209
01:52:59.40 --> 01:53:02.52
I don't know how to put I don't know how to do that on the computer you're like hold down this

1210
01:53:02.52 --> 01:53:11.24
key and press this and it's like mook was born you know mook was born it's gonna be a pretty

1211
01:53:11.24 --> 01:53:18.44
importance part of my texting somebody texting someone I like my phone auto corrects like

1212
01:53:18.44 --> 01:53:24.44
mook to mo oh umla okay all caps that's where the auto corrects you in the right row right

1213
01:53:24.44 --> 01:53:29.32
mook so that's all that extra doesn't do that yeah you can change it and mine also the other

1214
01:53:29.32 --> 01:53:35.72
thing I have when I write jj it turns into jitter so that way I don't type about jitter with a

1215
01:53:35.72 --> 01:53:39.000
hyphen in there every time you know you got to change the keyboard and I tried jj and it says

1216
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
jjitter gotta be honest I didn't know you could do that yes you can so there's a

1217
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.16
probably the two that you actually need just mook and jjitter because you type mook so off and

1218
01:53:49.16 --> 01:53:54.84
I type jitter so off and because even like responding on Twitter it works so I just said jj

1219
01:53:54.84 --> 01:53:59.24
jj jj it's just so you must get a lot of questions like what do you need to be successful in life

1315
02:03:08.60 --> 02:03:13.16
so I was just about to do it again and that's constrained myself and see it's really comes full

1332
02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:52.76
told me yeah right out like cool jockel says cool stop I get it but the way I kind of kind of

1333
02:04:52.76 --> 02:04:58.36
distilled it down as far as like the format is if you're seeing something important and it's kind of

1334
02:04:58.36 --> 02:05:04.92
longer than one minute I won't put any explosions on it cool okay under one minute explosions and

1335
02:05:04.92 --> 02:05:12.20
flames by the way we got psychological warfare little moments of weakness that you might experience

1336
02:05:12.20 --> 02:05:18.60
during your day in your brain in your own little brain little debates that are happening the weak

1337
02:05:18.60 --> 02:05:24.04
voice versus the strong voice sometime the weak voice gets stronger and it needs to catch a beat

1338
02:05:24.04 --> 02:05:31.80
down that's when you press play on your iPhone that little psychological warfare track that tells you

1347
02:06:34.84 --> 02:06:38.20
maybe it's gonna be one of those kind of helicopters that didn't know it freaks me out the

1348
02:06:38.20 --> 02:06:44.28
that kind of helicopter when you go into it I've been in number four they seem like you remember when

1349
02:06:44.28 --> 02:06:47.80
you built a model when you were kid you did you ever do a build a model when you were kid it was

1350
02:06:47.80 --> 02:06:53.72
little plastic pieces and they stuck them together with test testers glue yeah it seems like

1351
02:06:53.72 --> 02:06:59.80
this is one elevation above that just one it seems like someone made this thing out of little

1352
02:06:59.80 --> 02:07:04.60
right a vector set pieces that's what it seems that's what those helicopters feel like when you get

1353
02:07:04.60 --> 02:07:09.16
in them and when you find them that's what they feel like if you don't like flying you're not going

1354
02:07:09.16 --> 02:07:15.24
to be game for that especially with decoda track I will declare you as the climb plus you weigh

1355
02:07:15.24 --> 02:07:25.40
900 pounds so that would be like flying lopsided people he is a savage and we're actually going to

1356
02:07:25.40 --> 02:07:30.04
get to do that and drink form the I don't we got to come up with a better name than energy drink

1357
02:07:30.04 --> 02:07:38.52
for the go what we will think about but but it's going to be called dack savage dack savage

02:08:13.56 --> 02:08:21.000
fitness gear kettlebells battle ropes rings maces steel bells you know all this kind of

1365
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.76
would you call that new age workout is a good option obviously yeah it's like old school

1366
02:08:26.76 --> 02:08:31.80
right back right yeah yeah it's weird especially like kettlebells how they kind of came back

1367
02:08:31.80 --> 02:08:37.64
like with a vengeance yeah they did oh yeah did I resend you will let their medicine ball that we

1368
02:08:37.64 --> 02:08:44.04
were making no let me say you know but I saw one in the mountain training facility okay there you go

then we went to your house we hung out then we went back and so we got to bed it wasn't that

1375
02:09:23.64 --> 02:09:29.40
late of a night we had to bed at like 10 o'clock 10 30 so I wake up in the morning I'm in Maine

1376
02:09:29.40 --> 02:09:35.96
I'm stoked I'm at the mountain training facility and I go downstairs you got and it was one of

1377
02:09:35.96 --> 02:09:39.96
those things I just had just figured out a good little workout with the equipment the cheddar went

1378
02:09:39.96 --> 02:09:47.64
you guys had an abolk bullgirium bag 28 kilogram kettlebell which is which is in between I have 24

1379
02:09:47.64 --> 02:09:52.52
I have 32 so I had a little meat you know just as little mix it up I was gonna up the reps you know

1380
02:09:52.52 --> 02:09:58.12
to try some other movements and so I'm down there getting after it's 430 I get done with that

1381
02:09:58.12 --> 02:10:03.000
and I was cranking up some music I was cranking up some rock and roll yeah yeah a little playlist

1382
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:10.52
yeah a little some dansic some kaias and then it just plain whatever I get done I go upstairs shower

1383
02:10:10.52 --> 02:10:16.04
get done and I have two documents that I got to edit so I edit these documents and it's you know it

1384
02:10:16.04 --> 02:10:21.56
takes a while but two legit full documents I'm editing get done with that and then I look at my

1385
02:10:21.56 --> 02:10:25.72
watch that was the morning we talked for like two hours we talked for two hours after I don't

1386
02:10:25.72 --> 02:10:30.20
work I went for a run I actually went for that run down you would towards your old house yeah

1387
02:10:30.20 --> 02:10:36.28
I went for a nice long run I get done with all this stuff and I look at my watch and indeed

1388
02:10:36.28 --> 02:10:44.52
and and echo are still asleep and I go that's weird that you still asleep and it's two it's 1240

1389
02:10:44.52 --> 02:10:51.72
in the afternoon and at first I know movement so I send my text like so I send my text like

1390
02:10:51.72 --> 02:10:56.68
hey are you guys alive like kind of calling them out and then I think to myself wait a second

1391
02:10:56.68 --> 02:11:04.52
maybe they it's been 14 hours they must be dead they must be dead and I got like a little nervous

1392
02:11:04.52 --> 02:11:11.40
and I'm like they're going to carbon monoxide poison like I get it okay I sleep less right

1393
02:11:11.40 --> 02:11:18.12
than a normal person cool I got some weird genetics cool I sleep five hours this is three times

1394
02:11:18.12 --> 02:11:21.88
that right there's no way a person can see that long I think there's carbon monoxide

1395
02:11:21.88 --> 02:11:27.72
pores and then we don't fight cold bodies I go in there and they're just like echoes you know

1396
02:11:27.72 --> 02:11:35.24
like oh this is really tired oh yeah so there it was nice nonetheless anyway on it yeah on it

1397
02:11:35.24 --> 02:11:40.28
that's where you get the cool stuff get up as they did come back I do have a 28 pound or kilogram

1398
02:11:40.28 --> 02:11:45.48
kettlebell that's like what 62 I kind of liked it man from I kind of like yeah I kind of liked

1399
02:11:45.48 --> 02:11:50.52
having a little intermediary the problem is I can go overboard with stuff as we know and I'm

1400
02:11:50.52 --> 02:11:55.72
increased just until you die not only no just get like I'll have every kettlebell imaginable

1401
02:11:55.72 --> 02:12:00.52
oh yeah I do I have the whole spectrum and yeah but man it's worth it because like you can

1402
02:12:00.52 --> 02:12:04.20
modulate like throughout the whole work out especially if you're doing kettlebells which I highly

1403
02:12:04.20 --> 02:12:10.12
recommend by the way to kettlebells Pete I've just started recently just just like swinging them

1404
02:12:10.12 --> 02:12:14.68
yeah you should be swinging a nice light weight because you got your back situation

1405
02:12:14.68 --> 02:12:20.76
swing a nice light weight and it is so good for you man it feels good you know here's

1406
02:12:20.76 --> 02:12:24.84
thing about kettlebell swings you won't feel this because you're going light but you think to yourself

1407
02:12:24.84 --> 02:12:30.36
oh I got whatever I got my 40 kilogram kettlebell no factor I'll swing this thing you know it's

1408
02:12:30.36 --> 02:12:36.84
going to be pretty easy and the first six of them it is easy you're like what is this yeah this

1409
02:12:36.84 --> 02:12:42.84
by the time you get to 16 you're like okay yep then you get to 24 you're like okay yep

1410
02:12:42.84 --> 02:12:48.76
I see what's going on yeah it's it kicks you yeah kicks you good even on the rolling machine

1411
02:12:48.76 --> 02:12:54.12
you got a different rolling machine but on a concept too my rolling machine when you start you're like

1412
02:12:54.12 --> 02:13:00.12
I'm gonna blast this thing out and it takes a minute for your for your energy system what's

1413
02:13:00.12 --> 02:13:07.40
that first energy system that you're using yeah like the ATP that immediate sprint one

1414
02:13:07.40 --> 02:13:11.000
and you're like using that and but then it gets used up yes you're anaerobic that's

1415
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.48
where your anaerobic system gets used up and then you're just sucking but you think you're

1416
02:13:15.48 --> 02:13:20.36
Superman for the first you know I'm a little belly meters do you usually roll it just depends

1417
02:13:20.36 --> 02:13:25.08
on what I'm doing just depends what I'm doing you know and I use it usually for sprinting I'm

1418
02:13:25.08 --> 02:13:30.04
usually not in there go for 20 minutes I've been doing a little bit when I couldn't run

1419
02:13:30.04 --> 02:13:34.76
because my knee I was rolling a little bit more and I was using minimum I wasn't going

1420
02:13:34.76 --> 02:13:39.40
to full range of motion but anyways so how long you going I go 30 minutes yeah that's cool

1421
02:13:39.40 --> 02:13:43.80
I try to 8000 meters yeah that's great minutes that's just consistent so yeah yeah I

1422
02:13:43.80 --> 02:13:48.60
did I I did one the other night because that the the mountain or treat where you had the

1423
02:13:48.60 --> 02:13:53.000
great workout that was our original factor yeah all the big timbers and stuff of course

1424
02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:58.68
and I uh I've been working out in the evenings and I did one the other night it was like a

1425
02:13:58.68 --> 02:14:04.92
home and I was really late and I just kept all the lights out and I rode in the pitch black could

1426
02:14:04.92 --> 02:14:09.72
you see the monitor or anything no and I just rode until you felt like I rode it and I actually

1427
02:14:09.72 --> 02:14:14.92
rode against my shadow because it was just a little bit of light behind me casting a shadow on

1428
02:14:14.92 --> 02:14:21.72
the wall and I just just like chasing my shadow and it was the best workout I had no idea how long

1429
02:14:21.72 --> 02:14:26.44
I had rode I just knew like 30 minutes I said the timer for in the pitch black and

1430
02:14:27.56 --> 02:14:32.44
it was freaking phenomenal I just like you did set the timer my phone timer yeah and it just went off

1431
02:14:32.44 --> 02:14:38.44
my phone so you had no idea it was just a puddle on it's what I was doing, it's kind of kind of

1432
02:14:38.44 --> 02:14:48.36
spiritual, right? it's exactly how you just like you see what I got some books I got a new book

1433
02:14:48.36 --> 02:14:54.92
Leadership strategy and tactics field manual that is available for pre-order right now.

1434
02:14:55.56 --> 02:15:00.28
If you want to get a first-of-disch, then you shorter right now. If you don't,

1435
02:15:01.08 --> 02:15:04.28
well it doesn't really matter what you do. Is that a hard copy? Oh, yes.

1436
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:11.80
Oh, yes. It is. Yeah. It's a hard cover book. Yeah. It's not the same size as the original field manual.

1437
02:15:11.80 --> 02:15:16.28
It's smaller so that people can carry it. That's one of the things that when you look to field

1438
02:15:16.28 --> 02:15:22.76
manual like, well, do we want to be able to carry it? I'm like, yeah, probably. This one is to be used

1439
02:15:23.32 --> 02:15:28.68
in the field leadership. What are some of the things that the chapter name? So it's broken down

1440
02:15:28.68 --> 02:15:34.36
like this. There's 80 chapters. Holy shit. Yeah. So there's 80 chapters, but they're short. Got it.

1441
02:15:34.36 --> 02:15:40.92
Heading chapters. Where you go. And it's all about leadership. It's my boss's micro-management. What do I do?

1442
02:15:40.92 --> 02:15:47.24
How would this work for for some of my floor managers? Because they're plugged into the training

1443
02:15:47.24 --> 02:15:51.96
program, the Ashline Front Training Program, the online program, which has been awesome.

1444
02:15:51.96 --> 02:15:58.12
You know, but it would be nice because they can't, they can't like be on that well, they're

1445
02:15:58.12 --> 02:16:02.52
operating. We call them operators, right? Well, they're operating, but if they did have like a book

1446
02:16:02.52 --> 02:16:07.40
that it was like that. That's what it is. That's why I made it. Yeah. And another thing is, I used to

1447
02:16:07.40 --> 02:16:12.92
build a say, if someone said, hey, you know, as far as practical application of these principles,

1448
02:16:12.92 --> 02:16:19.32
you know, what do I do if my, if I got a guy that's, if I got a guy that's got a lot of potential,

1449
02:16:19.32 --> 02:16:22.68
but he's not doing what he should be doing, what should I do? And I used to just be able to say,

1450
02:16:22.68 --> 02:16:27.56
hey, just listen, you know, go listen to podcasts. And when there was 20 podcasts, it's like,

1451
02:16:27.56 --> 02:16:31.80
oh, cool, you know, you listen to the podcast. Now if I tell someone, oh, the answer is in the podcast,

1452
02:16:31.80 --> 02:16:38.84
I'm basically assigning them over 500 hours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting. It's inappropriate, right?

1453
02:16:38.84 --> 02:16:42.44
So I had to take all this information and like distill it down. So you can say,

1454
02:16:42.44 --> 02:16:47.72
you just look it up. It's highly indexed. Okay. So you can just look up. That's cool. The subject

1455
02:16:47.72 --> 02:16:55.96
and boom go. So totally pragmatic. So would, if for, for like our, our managers, our floor managers,

1456
02:16:55.96 --> 02:17:03.80
would you say that the book replaces the online training or they serve two different purposes?

1457
02:17:03.80 --> 02:17:11.000
They serve two different purposes. Here's the facts. You, you, you want to, you don't get good at

1458
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.20
anything through one direction of training. How much better you, how much better you at, how

1459
02:17:16.20 --> 02:17:20.60
much better you at an arm lock if you learn it from four different instructors? Oh, yeah, you're,

1460
02:17:20.60 --> 02:17:27.80
your life better. How much better are you at any learning a subject if you learn three books

1461
02:17:27.80 --> 02:17:32.60
about a subject instead of one? Oh, yeah. infinitely better. It's not just better. It's,

1462
02:17:32.60 --> 02:17:37.88
it's exponentially better because you're able to compare and contrast what you learn the first time

1463
02:17:37.88 --> 02:17:42.12
with what you learn in the second time. You see it from another angle. So you see it one dimensional.

1464
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.000
You see it two dimensional on the third time you read a book about the same subject. You see it

1465
02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.64
for the third dimension. The fourth time now you're seeing the fourth dimension of things and that

1466
02:17:51.64 --> 02:17:58.28
continues to go. So all these things. So they need both. All these things are an effort to give the

1467
02:17:58.28 --> 02:18:05.08
different perspectives and different angles on these subjects because the better you get it them,

1468
02:18:05.08 --> 02:18:10.92
just like training you to. If, if you, the more you, the more time you spend on bottom and

1469
02:18:10.92 --> 02:18:15.64
inside control, the better you get it handling it. The more time you spend dealing with different

1470
02:18:15.64 --> 02:18:19.40
leadership problems, the better you get at it. The more different angles you can see, the better you

1471
02:18:19.40 --> 02:18:25.40
get at it. So that's the purpose. But I would say the initial ideal is like listen, people need to

1472
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:29.16
be able to apply these principles. They need, because here's another thing people read,

1473
02:18:29.16 --> 02:18:33.88
extreme ownership. They, they actually understand the principles. They can explain the principles

1474
02:18:33.88 --> 02:18:40.76
back to you. But as far as overlaying those principles and even overlaying the examples onto what

1475
02:18:40.76 --> 02:18:47.96
they're dealing with, sometimes people, sometimes some people have a hard time making those things

1476
02:18:47.96 --> 02:18:53.80
overlay properly. And so here it is. Instead of saying here's the principle overlay it on your

1477
02:18:53.80 --> 02:18:59.000
thing. It's like here's what it will look like right now when you put it there. It's more, it's more

1478
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:06.92
direct. You don't have to, you can do less. You can, you can, you can, it's just more direct.

1479
02:19:06.92 --> 02:19:15.48
So that's the leadership strategy and tactics field manual. I did just get a note from my publisher

1480
02:19:15.48 --> 02:19:22.52
and they said this was superb. Super superb. And you know that's pretty cool. You get, you know,

1481
02:19:22.52 --> 02:19:26.92
when you bring a bunch of books into this book is superb. That's, especially from a publisher

1482
02:19:26.92 --> 02:19:31.72
that reads books all the time. And they don't have to send you that note. Like this is from someone

1483
02:19:31.72 --> 02:19:35.96
at the publishing company that doesn't, doesn't just send out notes, right? So it's pretty

1484
02:19:35.96 --> 02:19:40.04
cool. So they probably read it and are applying the strategies. Yeah. Yeah. They're probably like,

1485
02:19:40.04 --> 02:19:45.72
okay, I'm going to use this now. Yeah. Totally. Also, way the Warrior Kid 3, where there's a will,

1486
02:19:46.60 --> 02:19:52.12
you can get that right now, way the Warrior Kid 1, Mark's mission. How many people at Camp? How many

1487
02:19:52.12 --> 02:19:56.76
books, how many Warrior Kid books have you seen? He signed at Camp all over. Yeah, all of them. There's

1488
02:19:56.76 --> 02:20:01.08
people after people, after people, after people, those books are having such an incredible impact.

1489
02:20:01.08 --> 02:20:07.32
It's so amazing to see, I don't think there's anything that makes me feel better at this point

1490
02:20:07.32 --> 02:20:14.60
in my life than getting, showing us a parent, showing me a video of a little kid doing a pull-up

1491
02:20:14.60 --> 02:20:18.12
and then looking at the camera and saying, I'm a Warrior Kid. Yeah. That's badass. Just doesn't

1492
02:20:18.12 --> 02:20:22.60
get any better than that. I've been signing more kid books too. By the way, that's awesome. I didn't

1493
02:20:22.60 --> 02:20:27.08
write it by the way, man. I signed a few. That's awesome. I took the picture in the back that's

1494
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:31.32
something. Got a manual. Confusion. Got to make a movie. We're working it. We're working it now.

1495
02:20:32.36 --> 02:20:35.64
Yep. And then this moment was Freedom Field Manual. That's another Field Manual. That's

1496
02:20:35.64 --> 02:20:43.88
one's directed at you individually. How to get after it. The audio version is on MP3. It's not

1497
02:20:43.88 --> 02:20:50.84
unautable. Extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership. The first two books where you learn the principles.

1498
02:20:51.08 --> 02:20:55.88
You have to know the principles. If you don't know the principles, applying them doesn't make any

1499
02:20:55.88 --> 02:21:01.88
sense to you. So, extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership get these principles into your head

1500
02:21:01.88 --> 02:21:09.24
so that you can apply them at your business, at your life. They work. They work. That's another

1501
02:21:09.24 --> 02:21:15.08
thing I hear all the time from people. They say, you know, I've been using it works. It works.

1502
02:21:15.08 --> 02:21:20.28
I'll give me specific examples of how it works. I had this customer call me and they said,

1503
02:21:20.28 --> 02:21:23.88
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, you know what? That's my fault. And they said,

1504
02:21:23.88 --> 02:21:29.48
you know what? I probably should have given you a better heads up. It works. It works.

1505
02:21:31.24 --> 02:21:36.92
We got our leadership consultancy. We're just called echelon front, go to echelon front.com.

1506
02:21:36.92 --> 02:21:45.56
If you have problems in your organization of any kind of any kind, they are leadership problems

1507
02:21:46.44 --> 02:21:52.04
and you need to help get your leadership squared away and the line and that is what we do at echelon

1508
02:21:52.04 --> 02:21:59.72
front. echelon front.com. We got EF online. Do you go? Do you share the size of clients you work

1509
02:21:59.72 --> 02:22:06.60
with? Like, do you let people know like, you guys are on the road? Or I should say around the world

1510
02:22:06.60 --> 02:22:12.92
all the time helping companies become better leaders, big companies. Like sometimes we're going

1511
02:22:12.92 --> 02:22:17.08
on the phone, you're like, oh, I'm here. So, then I say, like, oh, I'm here. Like, do people actually

1512
02:22:17.08 --> 02:22:23.80
understand the impact you're just having on leadership in corporate America as a whole? Maybe I

1513
02:22:23.80 --> 02:22:29.64
don't do a great job of explaining that. We work with the largest companies in the world.

1514
02:22:30.28 --> 02:22:37.88
And we also work with smaller companies as well. And if you're so small that it's out of the price

1515
02:22:37.88 --> 02:22:42.52
range for you as a company, guess what? We got something called the master. You can sign up and

1516
02:22:42.52 --> 02:22:46.36
come to one of our masters where we teach these principles. You can bring three, four people in your

1517
02:22:46.36 --> 02:22:50.92
leadership team. If you've got a company of, you know, 20 people, you can bring three, four of

1518
02:22:50.92 --> 02:22:55.16
your leaders and you kind of get that initiated. And then you can use something called the F online,

1519
02:22:55.16 --> 02:23:01.24
which you are using. Yeah, we use it. Yeah, and my, you know, and it's nice because before,

1520
02:23:01.24 --> 02:23:06.84
like, it's always come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, you know, and helping

1521
02:23:06.84 --> 02:23:11.88
helping our our leaders, which is basically everybody in the factory, become better leaders.

1522
02:23:11.88 --> 02:23:17.96
And to learn leadership principles. But now they can go online and then they come to me with

1523
02:23:17.96 --> 02:23:23.72
questions that have, right? So it's honestly it doesn't take as much time. We're sure wonderful.

1524
02:23:23.72 --> 02:23:28.60
So the efficiencies are going up. You know what I did at first? They were, you know, a few

1525
02:23:28.60 --> 02:23:32.92
Jill, the one that's stitching here in Jan. And a few others are like, when can we start? Can we

1526
02:23:32.92 --> 02:23:37.72
do this on company time? That was the first question. Can we, and of course, we don't have

1527
02:23:37.72 --> 02:23:43.80
computers set up in everything. And I was like, yes, yes, you can. Because I wanted them to know

1528
02:23:43.80 --> 02:23:49.56
that I'm invested in this. For sure. And once I, and so I was using the leadership techniques

1529
02:23:50.20 --> 02:23:55.64
to teach leadership. Yes. And then once they saw that I was in, then they went home and then they

1530
02:23:55.64 --> 02:23:59.64
got online. Yeah. And I was like, now they're doing it on their own time. Because I was invested

1531
02:23:59.64 --> 02:24:04.12
in them doing it on this, on our time. Of course, on company you want that. You think of the

1532
02:24:04.12 --> 02:24:11.88
cost benefit and the ROI we get at origin, you get at origin because of the leadership.

1533
02:24:11.88 --> 02:24:16.60
Yep. It's just the way it is. Yep. Yep. Absolutely. It's good. Awesome. Awesome stuff.

1534
02:24:18.20 --> 02:24:26.28
What else we got? We got. So yeah, if you can't come to, if you can't, if you can't hire

1535
02:24:26.28 --> 02:24:30.04
us on front, go to the master. The next one is taking place December 4th and 5th and Sidney.

1536
02:24:30.04 --> 02:24:35.56
We're about to release the follow on dates for 2020 as soon as we can. The thing is, here's the deal.

1537
02:24:35.56 --> 02:24:41.40
They all sell out. They all sell out 100%. And it's not like, hey, it's sold out, but we can fit in

1538
02:24:41.40 --> 02:24:47.80
eight more people. No, it's sold out and we no one else will be coming. So when I hear a crazy statistic,

1539
02:24:47.80 --> 02:24:54.36
yes, somebody said to me today, they know how many Americans are us like as 300 million Americans.

1540
02:24:54.36 --> 02:25:00.20
They're like, how many people are at this immersion camp? And I said, well, 300 per session. He's

1541
02:25:00.20 --> 02:25:06.20
like so one in a million. And I said, yeah, and we had the registration off three months early.

1542
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:11.96
How many people do you let into the master? It looks like it depends on the size of the venue,

1543
02:25:11.96 --> 02:25:18.28
but it's anywhere between 700 and 850. But the Australia one, we have less. We have a smaller

1544
02:25:18.28 --> 02:25:22.76
venue. We just couldn't get the size of venue that we need. So we have less. But so two in a

1545
02:25:22.76 --> 02:25:28.68
million, you're letting something like that. You know what I mean? It's, yeah, it's a solid value.

1546
02:25:28.68 --> 02:25:34.36
Add it is ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. So come and check out the master. And then, of course, we have

1547
02:25:35.24 --> 02:25:40.44
EF Overwatch, which we are, I had to talk about on this podcast, taking people that have experience

1548
02:25:40.44 --> 02:25:45.32
in leadership and putting them into companies in a civilian sector. So if you're a company that needs

1549
02:25:45.32 --> 02:25:51.80
leadership or you're a leader that needs to move on to your next mission in life, go to EF Overwatch.com.

1550
02:25:53.08 --> 02:26:00.04
And if you haven't heard enough of us, if you haven't heard enough stories about Jiu Jitsu,

1551
02:26:01.48 --> 02:26:08.44
shoes, jeans, whatever else you can find us on the in-or-webs. We're on Twitter, one on its

1558
02:26:41.32 --> 02:26:48.04
Where do you think you do most activity on? Origins. Oh, no, I'm saying Instagram. Yeah, Instagram is

1559
02:26:48.04 --> 02:26:53.56
where you do most of your, yeah, you do do Twitter. Yeah, because I throw Twitter your

02:26:53.56 --> 02:26:57.56
direction. Yeah, people say you throw it out. Hey, one of the jeans coming out, I say

1561
02:26:57.56 --> 02:27:03.64
as soon as or at origin BJJ releases on. Yeah, and then I'll jump on. Then you'll do. No, I do most

1562
02:27:03.64 --> 02:27:10.28
my activity on Instagram. So, and those two are at origin USA and then also at Pete M.

1563
02:27:10.28 --> 02:27:17.40
Roberts. Yeah, Pete dot M dot M dot Roberts. That's a pain in the ass isn't it? Yeah.

1564
02:27:18.76 --> 02:27:25.80
Somehow those two people that got their names. One's name is Adele Charles and one's name is

1565
02:27:25.80 --> 02:27:33.80
that Joko Willink and all the stuff that we're doing right now. We would not be doing any of it without

1566
02:27:33.80 --> 02:27:41.72
our military out there protecting the freedoms that we have. So, thank you all for holding the

1567
02:27:41.72 --> 02:27:46.68
line and also to our police and our law enforcement and our firefighters and our paramedics and

1568
02:27:46.68 --> 02:27:52.20
our EMTs and our dispatchers and the correctional officers and the board of patrol and the secret

1569
02:27:52.20 --> 02:27:56.84
service and all the first responders that are out there, you're the ones that are protecting us

1570
02:27:56.84 --> 02:28:03.000
here at home and protecting our way of life. So, thank you for what you do and to everyone else that's

1571
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:13.32
out there, there is much to be done. And I'll tell you what no matter what you hear about how

1572
02:28:13.32 --> 02:28:20.12
much competition there is in the world, the fact of the matter is there aren't that many people

1573
02:28:20.12 --> 02:28:34.84
that are actually willing to do the work. It's you. So, get up, get to work and get after it.

1574
02:28:34.84 --> 02:28:54.36
And until next time, the speed Roberts and Echo and Joko out.
