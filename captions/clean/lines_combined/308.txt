00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.90 This is Jockel Podcast number three.
00:00:02.90 --> 00:00:05.000 Oh, eight with echo Charles and me.
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.30 Jockel, we're in good evening, echo.
00:00:06.30 --> 00:00:07.14 Good evening.
00:00:07.14 --> 00:00:15.64 So tonight at long last, we are going to wrap up what has ended up being a six part series.
00:00:15.64 --> 00:00:18.98 I got a little out of control, didn't I?
00:00:18.98 --> 00:00:22.82 Well, I kind of got a little out of control this one.
00:00:22.82 --> 00:00:25.62 Well, how not to do it cannot be overstated?
00:00:25.62 --> 00:00:27.26 How not to do it cannot be overstated?
00:00:27.26 --> 00:00:28.30 It's explained that.
00:00:28.30 --> 00:00:33.76 It means like if there are little tips how not to do something, let's face it.
00:00:33.76 --> 00:00:35.76 The value is what it call infinite.
00:00:35.76 --> 00:00:36.76 It's infinite.
00:00:36.76 --> 00:00:38.10 Check, good point.
00:00:38.10 --> 00:00:40.84 The book is called on the psychology of military competence.
00:00:40.84 --> 00:00:45.20 We started on 303, podcast 303, 304, 305, 306, 307.
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:46.20 That's a lot of podcast.
00:00:46.20 --> 00:00:47.96 This is the winner.
00:00:47.96 --> 00:00:52.20 Most number of podcasts on a single book.
00:00:52.20 --> 00:00:53.64 If you haven't listened those, you can go back.
00:00:53.64 --> 00:00:56.72 I actually will say this in preparing this one.
00:00:56.72 --> 00:00:58.86 If you haven't listened those, you don't have to go back.
00:00:58.86 --> 00:01:00.16 You can listen to this one.
00:01:00.16 --> 00:01:05.26 There might be a couple of references, but they're not super, you'll be able to get through
00:01:05.26 --> 00:01:08.06 them.
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:11.86 And this section that we're about to cover kind of starts with the crux of the book.
00:01:11.86 --> 00:01:16.82 But again, when I started reading this book a couple of years ago, it was a couple, maybe
00:01:16.82 --> 00:01:17.82 a year ago.
00:01:17.82 --> 00:01:18.82 Maybe a couple of years ago.
00:01:18.82 --> 00:01:21.30 I should have forget when I got this book.
00:01:21.30 --> 00:01:27.68 But I knew it was going to take a while, I didn't know it was going to take this long,
00:01:27.68 --> 00:01:29.84 but here we are.
00:01:29.84 --> 00:01:31.92 I apologize for taking so long.
00:01:31.92 --> 00:01:41.14 Like you said, though, when you understand how not to do something and you understand what
00:01:41.14 --> 00:01:45.10 the pitfalls are and the mistakes you can make and the traps.
00:01:45.10 --> 00:01:46.38 These things are all traps.
00:01:46.38 --> 00:01:47.38 They're all traps.
00:01:47.38 --> 00:01:53.52 And when you start to be able to see the traps, it helps a person a lot.
00:01:53.52 --> 00:01:56.08 It doesn't make them not going to the traps.
00:01:56.08 --> 00:01:57.08 That's the whole point.
00:01:57.08 --> 00:02:01.70 That's one of the whole points of this book is people know that this is a trap and they
00:02:01.70 --> 00:02:02.70 walk right into it.
00:02:02.70 --> 00:02:04.28 They just can't even help themselves.
00:02:04.28 --> 00:02:06.70 Like remember the whole name dropping thing that he talked about?
00:02:06.70 --> 00:02:11.42 I forget which one it was, but the name dropping, everybody knows it looks whack and
00:02:11.42 --> 00:02:12.42 they still do it.
00:02:12.42 --> 00:02:14.06 They can't control themselves.
00:02:14.06 --> 00:02:19.46 Well, let me rephrase that, an arrogant, egotistical person that's nervous about how they
00:02:19.46 --> 00:02:20.46 look.
00:02:20.46 --> 00:02:23.02 They're going to name drop even though they know it looks bad.
00:02:23.02 --> 00:02:26.62 Even though they'll point at someone else and say, oh, listen to Carrie name drop.
00:02:26.62 --> 00:02:29.66 They'll do that and then they'll name drop.
00:02:29.66 --> 00:02:31.06 They'll go, hey, see you.
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:32.06 Carrie was name drop and over.
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:33.06 You see him name dropping me.
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:35.46 I was talking to Joe Rogan yesterday.
00:02:35.46 --> 00:02:38.06 You're not on saying it?
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:40.06 That's how whack people are.
00:02:40.06 --> 00:02:44.02 That's how we get stuck in lame situations.
00:02:44.02 --> 00:02:49.94 So the crux of this book is actually the chapter we're going to start with right now.
00:02:49.94 --> 00:02:51.34 Dave Burke could make it by the way.
00:02:51.34 --> 00:02:54.34 It's good to work in busy.
00:02:54.34 --> 00:03:02.46 The chapter here is called authoritarianism and this is kind of the crux and this is
00:03:02.46 --> 00:03:06.34 this is what we need to watch out for.
00:03:06.34 --> 00:03:08.46 This is what we need to watch out for.
00:03:08.46 --> 00:03:10.38 This authoritarian mindset.
00:03:10.38 --> 00:03:13.06 Look, do you need to watch out for it as a nation?
00:03:13.06 --> 00:03:19.62 Yes, you better, especially as things start getting imposed on your life because that slides
00:03:19.62 --> 00:03:21.62 into authoritarianism.
00:03:21.62 --> 00:03:23.34 And that's a slippery slope.
00:03:23.34 --> 00:03:25.14 And I know you're going to bring up the slippery slope.
00:03:25.14 --> 00:03:26.14 Valicy.
00:03:26.14 --> 00:03:28.14 Well, I see you didn't your eyes.
00:03:28.14 --> 00:03:32.82 No, well, again, and I'll see that I said it before where there is such things as slippery
00:03:32.82 --> 00:03:33.82 slope.
00:03:33.82 --> 00:03:35.38 And there is such things as slippery slope.
00:03:35.38 --> 00:03:36.38 Valicy.
00:03:36.38 --> 00:03:38.58 They're not like one doesn't, you know.
00:03:38.58 --> 00:03:39.58 They both exist.
00:03:39.58 --> 00:03:42.02 They both exist exactly right.
00:03:42.02 --> 00:03:48.62 So authoritarianism in our minds, we have to watch out for it in our teams.
00:03:48.62 --> 00:03:49.94 As leaders, we have to watch out for it.
00:03:49.94 --> 00:03:55.06 And yes, as human beings living in a whatever country you live in, you need to watch out
00:03:55.06 --> 00:03:56.98 for that authoritarianism.
00:03:56.98 --> 00:04:03.82 Because it's a thing that once it starts to take hold, the authoritarian, it's no boss.
00:04:03.82 --> 00:04:05.26 Like, I get a little bit of control.
00:04:05.26 --> 00:04:08.26 A authoritarian people when they get a little bit of control, they want more control.
00:04:08.26 --> 00:04:09.90 And then they get a little bit more, they want even more.
00:04:09.90 --> 00:04:11.26 And they don't stop.
00:04:11.26 --> 00:04:20.74 It's a, it's a, it's a psychopathology that they have, that they can't contain it.
00:04:20.74 --> 00:04:21.74 So here we go.
00:04:21.74 --> 00:04:22.74 authoritarianism.
00:04:22.74 --> 00:04:26.86 In discussing military organizations, it was suggested that a symbiotic relationship
00:04:26.86 --> 00:04:31.86 exists between certain characteristics of armed services and the private needs of the individual
00:04:31.86 --> 00:04:32.86 members.
00:04:32.86 --> 00:04:36.54 So what that's saying is, when you go on the military, there's certain needs that certain
00:04:36.54 --> 00:04:40.38 people have, certain psychological needs that people have.
00:04:40.38 --> 00:04:43.22 But going in the military satisfies those needs.
00:04:43.22 --> 00:04:46.62 For instance, here's an example of where this is a bad thing.
00:04:46.62 --> 00:04:49.26 I like to rule over people.
00:04:49.26 --> 00:04:55.50 I know if I be coming off during the military, I'll be able to rule over those privates.
00:04:55.50 --> 00:05:01.14 So it sort of satisfies that to me.
00:05:01.14 --> 00:05:02.70 So there's a nice relationship I have.
00:05:02.70 --> 00:05:04.46 I want to be an authoritarian.
00:05:04.46 --> 00:05:06.14 This puts me into an authoritarian position.
00:05:06.14 --> 00:05:07.94 I love it.
00:05:07.94 --> 00:05:09.94 Is this true of all military people?
00:05:09.94 --> 00:05:10.94 No, it's not.
00:05:10.94 --> 00:05:15.22 Continue on emphasis was laid upon the central role in this relationship of anxiety that
00:05:15.22 --> 00:05:18.90 incidious motivator of such, of much human behavior.
00:05:18.90 --> 00:05:23.18 In the military mind, it was pointed out anxiety has many sources.
00:05:23.18 --> 00:05:29.94 Fear of death and mutilation, fear of suppression, fear of failure and social disapproval,
00:05:29.94 --> 00:05:36.94 fear of public disgrace and underlying all that fear of total disorder, which is in separable
00:05:36.94 --> 00:05:41.26 product of unleashing normally tabooed instinctual forces.
00:05:41.26 --> 00:05:46.14 So if you're a person that doesn't like disorder, you look at the military and go,
00:05:46.14 --> 00:05:47.14 huh?
00:05:47.14 --> 00:05:48.14 That looks pretty good.
00:05:48.14 --> 00:05:49.54 You gotta go to bed at a certain time.
00:05:49.54 --> 00:05:50.54 All these people will listen to me.
00:05:50.54 --> 00:05:51.54 We get to follow orders.
00:05:51.54 --> 00:05:52.54 They're going to tell me what to do.
00:05:52.54 --> 00:05:55.14 Everyone's going to listen to when I tell them what to do.
00:05:55.14 --> 00:05:59.70 That's you, you're a, if you don't like disorder, that's a great place to be.
00:05:59.70 --> 00:06:08.66 Until what happens, the layer of total disorder on planet earth opens its jaws and that
00:06:08.66 --> 00:06:10.02 is combat.
00:06:10.02 --> 00:06:15.54 So now you're a person that doesn't like disorder and for your job at the moment of truth,
00:06:15.54 --> 00:06:20.78 you are thrust into the jaws of the highest level of disorder in the world.
00:06:20.78 --> 00:06:22.42 That is combat.
00:06:22.42 --> 00:06:25.14 And that's why this is, that's what this book is about.
00:06:25.14 --> 00:06:29.66 This psychology of military incompetence is because people that like order.
00:06:29.66 --> 00:06:31.70 They join the military because they like order.
00:06:31.70 --> 00:06:33.10 And then they're actual job.
00:06:33.10 --> 00:06:37.10 Look, part of their job is marching around a parade field and inspecting uniforms and keeping
00:06:37.10 --> 00:06:38.10 everything square away.
00:06:38.10 --> 00:06:39.10 That's great.
00:06:39.10 --> 00:06:46.70 But when that, when that homey shows up and shit's getting crazy, they lose their minds.
00:06:46.70 --> 00:06:50.34 So when you're looking, when you're judging and you're thinking, I want to find that
00:06:50.34 --> 00:06:51.58 bad guy be a good military officer.
00:06:51.58 --> 00:06:54.10 They're highly disciplined.
00:06:54.10 --> 00:06:55.10 They're highly disciplined.
00:06:55.10 --> 00:06:57.30 They, they, they, they follow orders.
00:06:57.30 --> 00:06:59.62 They're a foritary and they seem like they be great.
00:06:59.62 --> 00:07:04.10 You need to remember what's that person going to do when things get wild and they're
00:07:04.10 --> 00:07:07.18 going to get wild.
00:07:07.18 --> 00:07:09.30 Continuing on, finally it was suggested.
00:07:09.30 --> 00:07:14.26 And you can see where this whole book, that little, that, that crocks.
00:07:14.26 --> 00:07:15.98 That's why I said this is the crux of the book.
00:07:15.98 --> 00:07:20.22 That crux right there is why this is so fascinating to me because I've seen this throughout
00:07:20.22 --> 00:07:21.62 my career.
00:07:21.62 --> 00:07:26.02 People that were square away, people that were highly disciplined, people that were
00:07:26.02 --> 00:07:30.82 loved for things to be in order and when things weren't going right or things were getting
00:07:30.82 --> 00:07:33.34 wild, they'd lose their minds.
00:07:33.34 --> 00:07:37.62 And by the way, if they never got put into a situation where things got wild, they get
00:07:37.62 --> 00:07:39.26 promoted by the way.
00:07:39.26 --> 00:07:42.34 They're getting promoted because they're the most ordered.
00:07:42.34 --> 00:07:47.62 They kept the tightest reins on their troops.
00:07:47.62 --> 00:07:51.42 Back to the book, finally it was suggested that a special predisposition toward these several
00:07:51.42 --> 00:07:55.70 sorts of anxiety may be present some people as a result of their early childhood.
00:07:55.70 --> 00:07:59.82 Again, this is where, and somebody pointed this out to me on one of the YouTube comments,
00:07:59.82 --> 00:08:03.30 the word I was looking for was psychobabble.
00:08:03.30 --> 00:08:04.30 Psychobabble.
00:08:04.30 --> 00:08:08.70 Because again, this guy was a psychologist, so he ties all the stuff into weird Freudian
00:08:08.70 --> 00:08:10.30 freaking childhood experiences.
00:08:10.30 --> 00:08:12.02 And I can't back any that up.
00:08:12.02 --> 00:08:14.02 I don't know about any of that.
00:08:14.02 --> 00:08:17.38 What I do know is this, people have different personalities.
00:08:17.38 --> 00:08:20.34 Where those personalities came from, I don't really know, and I actually don't care.
00:08:20.34 --> 00:08:22.02 You show up to a seal team.
00:08:22.02 --> 00:08:27.66 Your personality is that whatever your personality is, and that's great.
00:08:27.66 --> 00:08:29.46 That's fine.
00:08:29.46 --> 00:08:30.78 I don't care where it came from.
00:08:30.78 --> 00:08:34.62 If you're hyper-ordered and you can't stand it when things get wild, you're not going
00:08:34.62 --> 00:08:38.54 to be a good seal officer or a good seal leader.
00:08:38.54 --> 00:08:44.70 If you're totally rebellious and you can't fall in the line ever, well that's too far
00:08:44.70 --> 00:08:48.82 in the other direction, and now you can't control anything, you can't control yourself.
00:08:48.82 --> 00:08:54.42 So we want to find some of that balances that dichotomy, but whether it comes from early childhood
00:08:54.42 --> 00:08:58.66 in the way you were potty trained in all these kinds of psychobabble, I don't know.
00:08:58.66 --> 00:08:59.66 I don't know.
00:08:59.66 --> 00:09:04.94 We'll have to ask Jordan B. Peter's a name drop about that one.
00:09:04.94 --> 00:09:08.38 Such people may well be drawn towards military organizations because the latter have
00:09:08.38 --> 00:09:14.86 of necessity, perfected devices like bullshit, discipline, and hierarchical command structures
00:09:14.86 --> 00:09:20.34 and rigid conventions, which not only allow aggression without anxiety, but also reduce
00:09:20.34 --> 00:09:23.98 anxiety that may have originated much earlier period of life.
00:09:23.98 --> 00:09:28.58 Again, a little bit, a little bit psychoanalysis too much for me.
00:09:28.58 --> 00:09:32.78 It's sort of, it's a bummer because as I've said many times, Jordan Peterson may be
00:09:32.78 --> 00:09:36.46 starting to like think maybe psychology was sort of a real thing.
00:09:36.46 --> 00:09:38.46 This is kind of dropping back in the back.
00:09:38.46 --> 00:09:41.30 Sorry, psychology.
00:09:41.30 --> 00:09:47.22 Somebody who put somebody who went, I was reading YouTube notes, no comments.
00:09:47.22 --> 00:09:51.62 And somebody was telling me that, you know, what much of what Freud said was actually right,
00:09:51.62 --> 00:10:00.42 but he's just been so like hammered by his reputation because he was a cocaine fiend.
00:10:00.42 --> 00:10:04.82 And now we kind of dis dis dis disperse or dispatch everything that he said.
00:10:04.82 --> 00:10:06.18 So maybe I was a little hard on him.
00:10:06.18 --> 00:10:07.18 I don't know.
00:10:07.18 --> 00:10:10.70 As far as I'm concerned, if you're doing a lot of cocaine like that and you're prescribing
00:10:10.70 --> 00:10:15.46 it to a bunch of people and you're lying about who's getting cured, I kind of take a lot of
00:10:15.46 --> 00:10:17.46 what you said and thrown out the window.
00:10:17.46 --> 00:10:19.62 Yeah, well, what's that?
00:10:19.62 --> 00:10:21.74 There's a bias too, right?
00:10:21.74 --> 00:10:23.46 The cocaine addiction.
00:10:23.46 --> 00:10:24.46 I don't know.
00:10:24.46 --> 00:10:25.46 Yes, that's my bias.
00:10:25.46 --> 00:10:27.46 I'm biased against people that are addicted to cocaine.
00:10:27.46 --> 00:10:28.46 No, it's not a bias.
00:10:28.46 --> 00:10:29.46 It's a logical fallacy.
00:10:29.46 --> 00:10:36.34 I don't know if you're you're committing this logical fallacy, but it's the, I forget
00:10:36.34 --> 00:10:37.34 what it is.
00:10:37.34 --> 00:10:41.06 The example is like, oh, why would you listen to Fred?
00:10:41.06 --> 00:10:43.42 Fred doesn't even have a job.
00:10:43.42 --> 00:10:46.58 So it's kind of like, okay, it's like, I think I am committing this.
00:10:46.58 --> 00:10:48.62 It's like, you kind of like, why would you listen to Freud?
00:10:48.62 --> 00:10:50.62 I know Freud's addicted to cocaine.
00:10:50.62 --> 00:10:51.62 Yeah, I'm lying to people.
00:10:51.62 --> 00:10:55.02 I'm not saying you're making the bad decision and I'm like that.
00:10:55.02 --> 00:10:59.18 I'm saying from a logical standpoint, it's technically a fallacy.
00:10:59.18 --> 00:11:02.82 It's like, okay, that means if you do cocaine, everything else you say is incorrect.
00:11:02.82 --> 00:11:03.82 Is that what that means?
00:11:03.82 --> 00:11:04.82 Yeah.
00:11:04.82 --> 00:11:05.82 For a logical standpoint.
00:11:05.82 --> 00:11:06.82 You're right.
00:11:06.82 --> 00:11:11.26 Well, I'll concede that per, well, that's what I am continuing.
00:11:11.26 --> 00:11:12.26 Okay.
00:11:12.26 --> 00:11:13.26 Freud was right part of the time.
00:11:13.26 --> 00:11:16.34 Give Freud his part on some of the stuff.
00:11:16.34 --> 00:11:22.54 As you was, you know, just not a, in light of all this, it is encouraging to encounter
00:11:22.54 --> 00:11:26.18 a substantial body of research, which not only provides support for the thesis, but also
00:11:26.18 --> 00:11:29.70 fills in many of the gaps.
00:11:29.70 --> 00:11:34.42 It is that on the authoritarian personality and then they get into this massive section
00:11:34.42 --> 00:11:37.54 about the authoritarian personality, which I'm not comfortable with because I've already spent
00:11:37.54 --> 00:11:40.54 six freaking podcasts on this book, which is all good.
00:11:40.54 --> 00:11:44.98 But I'm going to do a little bit of it for the impetus behind the study of authoritarianism.
00:11:44.98 --> 00:11:53.98 We have to think the founders and proponents of the third Reich, they, it who was presented
00:11:53.98 --> 00:11:58.50 to the world, a phenomenon, the like of which has never been seen before, since the
00:11:58.50 --> 00:12:05.18 systematic bureaucratized murder of six million Jews to the inquiring mind anti-Semitism
00:12:05.18 --> 00:12:09.78 on the scale would seem to demand at the very least some explanation for group of researchers
00:12:09.78 --> 00:12:15.78 at Frankfurt and later at Berkeley, California, the fact that human prejudice could assume
00:12:15.78 --> 00:12:21.06 such monstrous proportion suggested the possibility of a particular personality type being
00:12:21.06 --> 00:12:23.86 implicated in the perpetration of these dark events.
00:12:23.86 --> 00:12:33.30 So basically he's saying, look, the Nazis were psycho, where did their personality come from,
00:12:33.30 --> 00:12:35.34 what type of people had that personality?
00:12:35.34 --> 00:12:42.26 And then he goes into a Nazi psychologist whose name was Jinch, something like that,
00:12:42.26 --> 00:12:48.34 Jinch, I don't know, sorry, they're Nazi bastards from mispronouncing your name.
00:12:48.34 --> 00:12:58.50 So he broke it down and there was S types at the high end could have something called
00:12:58.50 --> 00:13:01.50 Syncysia, have you ever heard of Syncysia before?
00:13:01.50 --> 00:13:04.02 Syncysia, this is a very interesting story.
00:13:04.02 --> 00:13:11.54 So Syncysia, Seston, he was could memorize any number immediately.
00:13:11.54 --> 00:13:16.58 So if he met like a female in a bar, he would say what's your number and they would
00:13:16.58 --> 00:13:20.26 say it and he would immediately know it.
00:13:20.26 --> 00:13:26.74 And then he was really good at weird math problems and he could memorize dates.
00:13:26.74 --> 00:13:35.06 And one day we were talking because it was notistable enough, how good he was at it,
00:13:35.06 --> 00:13:38.90 that you think to yourself, there's something a little different, that's really weird how
00:13:38.90 --> 00:13:40.90 he could memorize this stuff.
00:13:40.90 --> 00:13:47.90 So he said to me one day he goes, you know, this is kind of weird, but when I see numbers,
00:13:47.90 --> 00:13:53.66 I don't see a number, I see a color and it has like a texture to it.
00:13:53.66 --> 00:13:59.46 And I was like, okay, bro, if we were to the military, I'd think you were maybe on
00:13:59.46 --> 00:14:00.46 something.
00:14:00.46 --> 00:14:03.06 So LSD or whatever.
00:14:03.06 --> 00:14:04.34 So he, I said, what do you mean?
00:14:04.34 --> 00:14:10.86 He says, well, for me, and then he described the colors of each, the colors and textures
00:14:10.86 --> 00:14:13.70 of each number.
00:14:13.70 --> 00:14:18.34 So the only one I remember was that zero was like hollow.
00:14:18.34 --> 00:14:20.54 He said he said zero was hollow.
00:14:20.54 --> 00:14:24.34 It's not, it's like it's not there.
00:14:24.34 --> 00:14:27.70 One was white.
00:14:27.70 --> 00:14:31.74 And the other one I remember is seven was yellow.
00:14:31.74 --> 00:14:34.18 And the reason I remembered that one was because I have two sevens in my phone number and
00:14:34.18 --> 00:14:37.54 when the first time I asked him what I said, say my phone number in colors and he was
00:14:37.54 --> 00:14:39.62 like, you know, yellow, yellow, but a blue.
00:14:39.62 --> 00:14:41.86 And yellow, yellow and I have two sevens.
00:14:41.86 --> 00:14:45.22 And I said, what's, I go seven, yellow because yeah.
00:14:45.22 --> 00:14:46.10 So it was just weird.
00:14:46.10 --> 00:14:49.50 He had no idea why this was the situation.
00:14:49.50 --> 00:14:56.54 So one day I'm in a bookstore and this is kind of early in the day when you would
00:14:56.54 --> 00:14:59.26 just go on a website to buy your books.
00:14:59.26 --> 00:15:07.54 I'm in a bookstore and I see numbers on a cover of a book and they're all colored and
00:15:07.54 --> 00:15:10.50 textured and I was, I was, that's weird.
00:15:10.50 --> 00:15:14.54 And I walk over and I pick it up and I start looking through it and it says, oh, this book is
00:15:14.54 --> 00:15:18.82 about a person that had Sanisticia.
00:15:18.82 --> 00:15:20.86 And so it, so I look it up.
00:15:20.86 --> 00:15:34.46 Sanisticia is a thing where you have multiple, multiple modes of interpreting information.
00:15:34.46 --> 00:15:37.66 So for instance, numbers have colors.
00:15:37.66 --> 00:15:40.66 They can have letters, can have colors.
00:15:40.66 --> 00:15:45.58 But that's the way, that's the way Seth fought.
00:15:45.58 --> 00:15:53.86 And so for this Nazi, the change, that was kind of the far end of this kind of wild, creative
00:15:53.86 --> 00:15:54.86 thing.
00:15:54.86 --> 00:16:00.30 This kind of wild, creative person here, it says, to have subjective experiences in one
00:16:00.30 --> 00:16:02.46 modality when receiving stimulation in another.
00:16:02.46 --> 00:16:05.50 This is the kind of wildest brain that you can get.
00:16:05.50 --> 00:16:08.94 And so this Nazi guy, this is the S type.
00:16:08.94 --> 00:16:10.74 These are people that are S types.
00:16:10.74 --> 00:16:14.86 It doesn't mean they necessarily have Sanisticia, but they're leaning in that direction.
00:16:14.86 --> 00:16:20.90 And this quote has the liberal in his views, eccentric behavior, also weak, a feminine
00:16:20.90 --> 00:16:25.90 and prone to a radical belief that people are largely shaped by their environment and education.
00:16:25.90 --> 00:16:31.86 Again, this is from an Nazi psychologist, which, if we're not listening to Freud, we're
00:16:31.86 --> 00:16:33.90 not listening to this Nazi dude.
00:16:33.90 --> 00:16:36.62 So but he's breaking it down in two types, the S type.
00:16:36.62 --> 00:16:39.46 And then the other type is the J type.
00:16:39.46 --> 00:16:49.26 And according to this guy, the J type were quote, good types that would make good Nazis
00:16:49.26 --> 00:16:55.22 amongst their sterling qualities, where purity and perception and the sure knowledge that
00:16:55.22 --> 00:16:59.62 human behavior is determined by blood, soil, and national tradition.
00:16:59.62 --> 00:17:07.90 The hence freaking Nazis, the J type, so the Nazi type would be a he-man hard and tough
00:17:07.90 --> 00:17:10.18 a man you could rely on.
00:17:10.18 --> 00:17:17.98 These qualities would he said have been handed down by a long line of North German ancestors.
00:17:17.98 --> 00:17:20.22 So this is what the Nazi says.
00:17:20.22 --> 00:17:26.14 And it's just, it's kind of funny because, well, Sstone was about as hard of a bastard
00:17:26.14 --> 00:17:27.86 as you could ever know.
00:17:27.86 --> 00:17:30.90 And a certain be a he-man, a divisible as well.
00:17:30.90 --> 00:17:35.54 And a warrior, a big freaking Viking warrior, a Texas mom, the other day, I was like, yeah,
00:17:35.54 --> 00:17:42.54 thanks for letting me hang out with that freaking savage, Viking kid of yours.
00:17:42.54 --> 00:17:45.86 So now we go to the Berkeley study.
00:17:45.86 --> 00:17:49.78 So we just did the Nazi study who got these two different types, the S type, which is sort
00:17:49.78 --> 00:17:55.14 of a liberal sort of a feminine type, and then the J type, which is more of the conservative
00:17:55.14 --> 00:17:57.14 hardcore type.
00:17:57.14 --> 00:18:03.34 And the American researchers later, going back to the book, also found two contrasting
00:18:03.34 --> 00:18:08.26 personality types, and these were very like those described by change.
00:18:08.26 --> 00:18:12.02 Needless to say, they evaluated them rather differently, the one that corresponded to the
00:18:12.02 --> 00:18:16.26 J type, they called the authoritarian personality.
00:18:16.26 --> 00:18:20.58 Such a person was anti-Semitic, rigid, intolerant of ambiguity.
00:18:20.58 --> 00:18:22.02 I can't think about this.
00:18:22.02 --> 00:18:25.90 If you're intolerant of ambiguity, think of how you're in a performing combat.
00:18:25.90 --> 00:18:31.46 You're going to be great in the military, in the in the in the in the rear of the military,
00:18:31.46 --> 00:18:34.54 because you're you don't like ambiguity, as soon as you're in combat, you don't know exactly
00:18:34.54 --> 00:18:35.54 know what's happening.
00:18:35.54 --> 00:18:39.34 You got to make it as soon as you're going to hate it.
00:18:39.34 --> 00:18:48.22 So intolerant of ambiguity and hostile to people or groups racially different from himself
00:18:48.22 --> 00:18:54.06 by the same token of the polar opposite to this type, change, contemptible, anti-type was
00:18:54.06 --> 00:19:02.30 individualistic, tolerant, democratic, unpredgidists, and egalitarian.
00:19:02.30 --> 00:19:06.14 So you've got these two different personalities.
00:19:06.14 --> 00:19:08.50 The Nazis called the bad one good.
00:19:08.50 --> 00:19:11.62 And the Berkeley people called the good one bad.
00:19:11.62 --> 00:19:15.82 So you get, however you want to break that down.
00:19:15.82 --> 00:19:20.82 Their test provided measures of anti-Semitism, ethnocentrism, political and economic
00:19:20.82 --> 00:19:28.22 conservatism, and implicit anti-democratic trends or potentiality for fascism, which
00:19:28.22 --> 00:19:30.06 they called the F scale.
00:19:30.06 --> 00:19:34.18 Like what is your potential of becoming a fascist?
00:19:34.18 --> 00:19:38.46 This much of which is based on by actual utterances by the Nazis measured in individuals
00:19:38.46 --> 00:19:40.22 predisposition towards.
00:19:40.22 --> 00:19:41.98 So this is what the F type.
00:19:41.98 --> 00:19:47.06 If you have a tendency where you can become a fascist, conventionalism, ie rigid adherence
00:19:47.06 --> 00:19:50.10 to conventional middle-class values.
00:19:50.10 --> 00:19:53.78 A foritarian submission.
00:19:53.78 --> 00:20:00.10 A submissive uncritical attitude toward the idealized moral authorities of the group,
00:20:00.10 --> 00:20:01.86 which he identifies himself.
00:20:01.86 --> 00:20:04.42 And that's what's kind of crazy, right?
00:20:04.42 --> 00:20:08.10 You would think that a foritarians would be hard to control.
00:20:08.10 --> 00:20:12.66 But if you're part of that group, they're in the game.
00:20:12.66 --> 00:20:17.86 So that's why I like the young officer in the military that he's totally down.
00:20:17.86 --> 00:20:22.10 He's saluting without most vigor because he's part of that system.
00:20:22.10 --> 00:20:23.66 And he's on board.
00:20:23.66 --> 00:20:27.94 He's submissive to the system.
00:20:27.94 --> 00:20:33.50 A foritarian aggression, ie, a tendency to be on the lookout for and to condemn reject
00:20:33.50 --> 00:20:37.38 and punish people who violate conventional values.
00:20:37.38 --> 00:20:40.62 It's kind of weird how there's like right now.
00:20:40.62 --> 00:20:46.78 You've got antifa who's supposed to be sort of like the wild antifascist who's actually
00:20:46.78 --> 00:20:51.34 totally on board with what I'm saying right now as they're off the charts on the F scale.
00:20:51.34 --> 00:20:57.98 Yeah, so like this, I don't know if this S F scale would reflect this specifically or accurately.
00:20:57.98 --> 00:21:01.22 But essentially, like two sides, right?
00:21:01.22 --> 00:21:03.18 One is real conventional, right?
00:21:03.18 --> 00:21:07.14 They're probably probably, I don't know, but they're probably going to ignore exceptions.
00:21:07.14 --> 00:21:10.26 You know, the value of exceptions and the nuance and all this stuff, right?
00:21:10.26 --> 00:21:12.10 They're going to tend to ignore it, right?
00:21:12.10 --> 00:21:17.98 Then you have the other side who probably overvalue nuance and exceptions.
00:21:17.98 --> 00:21:23.22 Kind of like, hey, if there's these exceptions, that must be just as equal as the rule.
00:21:23.22 --> 00:21:25.98 Because you know, you kind of look at the individual, you know?
00:21:25.98 --> 00:21:29.98 So that antifa analogy is absolutely correct.
00:21:29.98 --> 00:21:31.14 They're doing an exact same thing.
00:21:31.14 --> 00:21:32.14 They're just reversed.
00:21:32.14 --> 00:21:37.22 Yeah, you got to kind of, I don't know, back in the day, it seems like everyone was way
00:21:37.22 --> 00:21:38.22 more just in the middle.
00:21:38.22 --> 00:21:41.38 Well, balance is what we lose.
00:21:41.38 --> 00:21:44.82 What you want, even on these two things, do you want to be a fascist?
00:21:44.82 --> 00:21:48.10 No, but do you want to be crazy uncontrollable?
00:21:48.10 --> 00:21:49.82 No, you want to be balanced.
00:21:49.82 --> 00:21:50.82 Yeah.
00:21:50.82 --> 00:21:51.82 Yeah.
00:21:51.82 --> 00:21:57.70 And even just valuing like the group and then on the other hand, valuing the individual,
00:21:57.70 --> 00:21:59.26 it's like you got to value both of those things.
00:21:59.26 --> 00:22:00.26 I think about those things.
00:22:00.26 --> 00:22:01.26 100%.
00:22:01.26 --> 00:22:02.26 Yeah.
00:22:02.26 --> 00:22:03.26 100%.
00:22:03.26 --> 00:22:07.26 Next one, anti-interception.
00:22:07.26 --> 00:22:16.06 IE opposition to the subjective, the imaginative, and the tender-minded superstition and
00:22:16.06 --> 00:22:23.18 stereotype power and toughness preoccupation with the dominant submission, strong, weak,
00:22:23.18 --> 00:22:28.10 leader, follower, dimension, identification with power figures, overemphasis on conventional
00:22:28.10 --> 00:22:35.42 attributes of the ego, exaggeration, exaggerated, exaggerated assertion of strength and toughness.
00:22:35.42 --> 00:22:37.22 So how much of that is important?
00:22:37.22 --> 00:22:39.78 You know, that's putting you out there on that F scale a little bit.
00:22:39.78 --> 00:22:41.26 I'm starting to drift, man.
00:22:41.26 --> 00:22:43.54 Start to drift.
00:22:43.54 --> 00:22:46.10 Destructiveness and cynicism.
00:22:46.10 --> 00:22:49.38 Generalized hostility, vilification of the human.
00:22:49.38 --> 00:22:55.66 So obviously, a lot of this was focused around, hey, the Nazis and where the Nazis came from,
00:22:55.66 --> 00:23:01.26 part of that F thing is they can look at humans and be like whatever they don't matter.
00:23:01.26 --> 00:23:06.34 Projectivity, the belief that wild and dangerous things go on in the world, the projection
00:23:06.34 --> 00:23:14.68 outwards of unconscious emotional impulses, pure, atanical and exaggerated concern with
00:23:14.68 --> 00:23:20.74 sexual goings on.
00:23:20.74 --> 00:23:25.46 So you got these two personality types.
00:23:25.46 --> 00:23:30.34 Another little note here, these torturous machinations of the authority of the authoritarian
00:23:30.34 --> 00:23:32.70 mind, ramify yet further.
00:23:32.70 --> 00:23:37.50 As he has to deny his own shortcomings, he dare not look inward.
00:23:37.50 --> 00:23:42.70 He is fearful of insight and strenuously avoids questioning his own motives.
00:23:42.70 --> 00:23:48.78 Again, this is when people are, they're not real confident with themselves, so they project
00:23:48.78 --> 00:23:51.54 and look at everyone else.
00:23:51.54 --> 00:23:56.22 Similarly, the authoritarian personality is intolerant of ambivalence and ambiguity.
00:23:56.22 --> 00:23:57.22 We already hit that.
00:23:57.22 --> 00:24:03.06 Not as he cannot harbor negative and positive feelings for the same person, but must dichotomize
00:24:03.06 --> 00:24:09.18 reality into loved people versus hated people.
00:24:09.18 --> 00:24:16.98 So that's a very, that's restating what you said, because someone, what should you be able
00:24:16.98 --> 00:24:17.98 to do?
00:24:17.98 --> 00:24:21.58 You should be able to look at echo and be like, you know what, I like that echo, he's
00:24:21.58 --> 00:24:27.18 pretty nice, but also he can get a little bit lazy sometimes, but overall, you know,
00:24:27.18 --> 00:24:28.18 we're good.
00:24:28.18 --> 00:24:32.18 Cryptic messages, whatever.
00:24:32.18 --> 00:24:37.78 Right, but if I say echo is nice, but freaking easily easy, I can't stand him, right?
00:24:37.78 --> 00:24:41.46 And then you can start looking from one individual to look to a whole group of people,
00:24:41.46 --> 00:24:45.74 as you said, and start looking at a group of people and just saying, well, that group
00:24:45.74 --> 00:24:46.74 of people is bad.
00:24:46.74 --> 00:24:49.34 Did I just do that with Antifa?
00:24:49.34 --> 00:24:51.06 I just kind of, sorry, you implied it.
00:24:51.06 --> 00:24:52.06 I'm sorry, Antifa.
00:24:52.06 --> 00:24:57.14 I need a little bit more over-minded to your individuals.
00:24:57.14 --> 00:25:02.34 Yeah, they're one of those groups that they're, they're, they're current public facing
00:25:02.34 --> 00:25:08.42 persona, not that hard.
00:25:08.42 --> 00:25:14.58 There's another nine-year research that took place published a decade after the Berkeley
00:25:14.58 --> 00:25:22.34 Research, and this is something that I've been focused on a lot, and it's the open and
00:25:22.34 --> 00:25:29.58 closed mind centered on the problem of an individual's capacity to absorb fresh information,
00:25:29.58 --> 00:25:33.22 humanity it seems, varies considerably in this respect.
00:25:33.22 --> 00:25:35.62 And God, that is true.
00:25:35.62 --> 00:25:40.46 So this guy, his name is Rokech, Rockych, something like this, and he did this study,
00:25:40.46 --> 00:25:42.66 started breaking down, they're open in the close mind.
00:25:42.66 --> 00:25:44.66 Some people have open minds, some people have closed minds.
00:25:44.66 --> 00:25:50.46 And I actually think that this is even, kind of, trumps the F, what was it?
00:25:50.46 --> 00:25:51.46 The F scale.
00:25:51.46 --> 00:25:53.10 I think this trumps the F scale.
00:25:53.10 --> 00:25:57.38 How much can someone's mind open, how much can it close?
00:25:57.38 --> 00:26:04.02 And I've been talking a lot about this from a leadership perspective, because it is,
00:26:04.02 --> 00:26:07.54 to me, what we have to fight all the time.
00:26:07.54 --> 00:26:11.22 Our minds are constantly trying to close and be defensive and take care of themselves
00:26:11.22 --> 00:26:15.46 and not allow any other ideas in and what we have to do as people and as leaders is constantly
00:26:15.46 --> 00:26:18.62 pull your mind open, constantly except other people's ideas.
00:26:18.62 --> 00:26:21.94 It doesn't mean you have to think that the right, but you have to listen to them and assess
00:26:21.94 --> 00:26:23.38 them in an honest way.
00:26:23.38 --> 00:26:28.18 And what we have been doing a lot of, as a society, is just closing our minds to everyone else's
00:26:28.18 --> 00:26:29.18 ideas.
00:26:29.18 --> 00:26:31.62 And we don't want to hear what their perspective is, because we think we're right.
00:26:31.62 --> 00:26:36.94 And if you do that as a leader, you come to me with a viewpoint on my plan.
00:26:36.94 --> 00:26:42.06 And I don't open my mind to your viewpoint, I'm wrong.
00:26:42.06 --> 00:26:43.06 Goes on here.
00:26:43.06 --> 00:26:44.82 Humanity it seems, varies considerably in this respect.
00:26:44.82 --> 00:26:48.86 At the one extreme, our open minds, ready and willing to entertain new facts even if they
00:26:48.86 --> 00:26:52.70 are incompatible with their previously held attitudes and beliefs.
00:26:52.70 --> 00:26:53.70 That's what we want.
00:26:53.70 --> 00:26:55.30 You've got to open your mind and go, hey, you know what?
00:26:55.30 --> 00:26:59.82 I really expect to see those numbers or get that feedback, but there it is.
00:26:59.82 --> 00:27:03.98 And I need to put that in my calculus.
00:27:03.98 --> 00:27:09.34 The other, at the other end of the scale, are closed minds, which, as their name suggests,
00:27:09.34 --> 00:27:14.38 is a resultally resist taking in anything that conflicts with their preconceptions and treasured
00:27:14.38 --> 00:27:19.38 beliefs, not very surprisingly the possession of a closed mind turned out to be yet another
00:27:19.38 --> 00:27:26.22 aspect of the authoritarian personality.
00:27:26.22 --> 00:27:31.38 Is that, okay, so you can always make it like an analogy to wait lifting for some reason.
00:27:31.38 --> 00:27:32.38 No, you can.
00:27:32.38 --> 00:27:33.38 But I'm open to it.
00:27:33.38 --> 00:27:35.38 That's your way to go.
00:27:35.38 --> 00:27:40.66 Like I wonder if that's like a laser, you know, by nature, like the human body and brain
00:27:40.66 --> 00:27:42.86 is kind of late for lack of better term in slaves.
00:27:42.86 --> 00:27:45.30 It's conserving energy all the time, you know?
00:27:45.30 --> 00:27:50.54 So even like lifting weights, when you lift weights, your body's response to lifting weights
00:27:50.54 --> 00:27:52.54 is just a lazy, laziness mechanism.
00:27:52.54 --> 00:27:55.70 So the body is basically saying, oh, shoot, that was kind of hard.
00:27:55.70 --> 00:27:57.14 What do we got to do at home?
00:27:57.14 --> 00:27:59.62 Tell me in the body to make it a little bit easier next time.
00:27:59.62 --> 00:28:02.38 And then it adapts and gets bigger and stronger, whatever.
00:28:02.38 --> 00:28:07.14 So kind of like a weird, like I said, laziness, lack of better term mechanism.
00:28:07.14 --> 00:28:10.34 So like when you have a close mind, it's kind of like, hey, I already learned that.
00:28:10.34 --> 00:28:11.66 Like, give me some more stuff.
00:28:11.66 --> 00:28:12.66 I got to learn.
00:28:12.66 --> 00:28:13.66 You know, kind of thing.
00:28:13.66 --> 00:28:14.66 So then it's easier.
00:28:14.66 --> 00:28:15.94 Like because it's all mental, it's not physical.
00:28:15.94 --> 00:28:18.78 So you just kind of resist against it.
00:28:18.78 --> 00:28:24.02 And you can see where this ties into everything that I have talked about from a leadership
00:28:24.02 --> 00:28:29.14 perspective for my entire life, which is humility.
00:28:29.14 --> 00:28:33.06 Because if your humble, your mind is open, if your arrogant, your mind is closed, you
00:28:33.06 --> 00:28:34.06 think you know everything.
00:28:34.06 --> 00:28:35.06 You don't need to hear anything else.
00:28:35.06 --> 00:28:36.06 You're not going to make any adaptations.
00:28:36.06 --> 00:28:39.06 Yeah, when you see that little system that kind of makes sense.
00:28:39.06 --> 00:28:40.06 It makes so much sense.
00:28:40.06 --> 00:28:42.18 Right, especially go back to the weightlifting.
00:28:42.18 --> 00:28:44.06 Like you give your body some definitely go back to the left.
00:28:44.06 --> 00:28:45.06 That's only a workout.
00:28:45.06 --> 00:28:47.50 Right, the next day, you get that domes.
00:28:47.50 --> 00:28:49.06 Right, you don't like that stuff.
00:28:49.06 --> 00:28:52.10 Like I remember when I was little, I do some pushups, thinking I'm all cool, whatever,
00:28:52.10 --> 00:28:53.10 do some of the next day.
00:28:53.10 --> 00:28:55.78 I'm like, so I didn't know about domes that much.
00:28:55.78 --> 00:28:57.46 And bro, that's a terrible feeling.
00:28:57.46 --> 00:28:59.26 So super, I'm not doing that anymore.
00:28:59.26 --> 00:29:02.58 Or at the very least, the inside of my body, my body is like, okay, we got to do something
00:29:02.58 --> 00:29:06.54 easier or make it so it's easier next time that happens.
00:29:06.54 --> 00:29:09.78 So from a mental standpoint, it makes sense.
00:29:09.78 --> 00:29:11.18 Where Brad, what do you call it?
00:29:11.18 --> 00:29:13.70 The fucking you call, you talk to about it last.
00:29:13.70 --> 00:29:16.26 The cognitive dissidence or whatever.
00:29:16.26 --> 00:29:18.94 That is domes for your mind, essentially.
00:29:18.94 --> 00:29:22.10 Or maybe the precursor to the, I don't know, it's one of those things.
00:29:22.10 --> 00:29:23.54 I'm just saying it makes sense.
00:29:23.54 --> 00:29:24.54 Is that hurts?
00:29:24.54 --> 00:29:26.22 You know, when you get that new stuff.
00:29:26.22 --> 00:29:27.78 I don't want that new stuff.
00:29:27.78 --> 00:29:28.98 I'm good with this old stuff.
00:29:28.98 --> 00:29:29.98 Close mind.
00:29:29.98 --> 00:29:31.18 Yeah.
00:29:31.18 --> 00:29:35.22 He says here, before leaving this section on a foritarianism, there are several other research
00:29:35.22 --> 00:29:37.98 findings which are pertinent to our present thesis.
00:29:37.98 --> 00:29:42.86 One of these shows the relationship between conformity, a foritarianism, and the tendency
00:29:42.86 --> 00:29:44.98 to yield to group pressures.
00:29:44.98 --> 00:29:50.86 An extreme example of this pattern is the phenomenon of the participation in a lynch mob,
00:29:50.86 --> 00:29:56.18 where the naturally conformist individual happily yields to group pressure for the
00:29:56.18 --> 00:30:02.30 perpetration of a criminally aggressive act, which the holy at variance with the ethos
00:30:02.30 --> 00:30:08.98 of the wider society accords with his own narrow self-interest.
00:30:08.98 --> 00:30:16.14 So again, it's a, it's a, it's counterintuitive to think that someone that's a foritarian
00:30:16.14 --> 00:30:21.18 is going to be more apt to go with the group.
00:30:21.18 --> 00:30:25.18 Another finding concerns the effect of authoritarianism upon problem solving in a group
00:30:25.18 --> 00:30:26.02 situation.
00:30:26.02 --> 00:30:30.90 Oh, I love this one because again, I'm thinking of it from a military perspective and
00:30:30.90 --> 00:30:36.18 you start thinking, now you got this authoritarian in command how are they at problem solving?
00:30:36.18 --> 00:30:40.34 Well, let's go to the book from their research.
00:30:40.34 --> 00:30:47.02 W. H. Thorn in his colleagues concluded this, that, Equalitarian subjects, I.e. those
00:30:47.02 --> 00:30:52.66 low on authoritarianism were apparently more effective in dealing with a task in problem
00:30:52.66 --> 00:30:55.26 than were authoritarian.
00:30:55.26 --> 00:30:57.62 So that open mind is way better for problem solving.
00:30:57.62 --> 00:31:03.34 Seems obvious, but this was reflected in higher ratings of effective intelligence, leadership
00:31:03.34 --> 00:31:08.46 and goal-striving on the sorts of leaders who emerged in the group situation.
00:31:08.46 --> 00:31:16.22 They had this to say, emergent leaders in the low F groups were more sensitive to others,
00:31:16.22 --> 00:31:21.62 more effective leaders, more prone to making suggestions for action subject to group
00:31:21.62 --> 00:31:26.66 sanction and less likely to give direct orders to others.
00:31:26.66 --> 00:31:32.58 This is insane how much this matches everything I've been talking about.
00:31:32.58 --> 00:31:38.02 A conclusion incidentally, which accords with the observation that authoritarianists are less
00:31:38.02 --> 00:31:43.38 able to appreciate the effect they have upon others and may well think themselves more
00:31:43.38 --> 00:31:47.58 like to popular than they really are.
00:31:47.58 --> 00:31:51.98 I'm chuckling as I think of my military career and people that thought that they were super
00:31:51.98 --> 00:31:54.74 popular and everyone who you do.
00:31:54.74 --> 00:32:00.82 Even people attracted to a career in an authoritarian organization.
00:32:00.82 --> 00:32:09.02 I.e. the military have been found to prefer leaders who score low on a, on a, on
00:32:09.02 --> 00:32:13.38 test of authoritarianism, presumably because of authoritarianists are less sensitive to
00:32:13.38 --> 00:32:14.38 the needs of other.
00:32:14.38 --> 00:32:18.30 Even when you're a, when you're kind of authoritarian yourself and you joined the
00:32:18.30 --> 00:32:22.78 military, when you get asked about what type of leader you like, guess what?
00:32:22.78 --> 00:32:27.26 You actually like less authoritarian leaders because they listen, they treat you with respect,
00:32:27.26 --> 00:32:29.62 their minds are open.
00:32:29.62 --> 00:32:32.46 So this is the best way to lead across the board.
00:32:32.46 --> 00:32:37.34 You know, skyscrapers here in San Diego, California, I'm sure it's like this ever.
00:32:37.34 --> 00:32:38.86 I'm not an engineer.
00:32:38.86 --> 00:32:41.34 You know that.
00:32:41.34 --> 00:32:45.78 From what I understand, okay, so think of a tall building, right?
00:32:45.78 --> 00:32:46.78 It's talk.
00:32:46.78 --> 00:32:48.50 So that thing better be strong, right?
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:51.42 Hold itself up.
00:32:51.42 --> 00:32:53.66 But tall buildings aren't made rigidly.
00:32:53.66 --> 00:32:57.34 They're made with a little bit of flims, slim ziness on purpose.
00:32:57.34 --> 00:32:59.34 Tubzor, like movement.
00:32:59.34 --> 00:33:02.58 The various movements and vibrations that may or may not come about.
00:33:02.58 --> 00:33:04.38 So it's essentially the same thing.
00:33:04.38 --> 00:33:06.58 On the surface, you think, well, yeah, authoritarianism.
00:33:06.58 --> 00:33:08.66 That's the way you can't destroy it.
00:33:08.66 --> 00:33:12.62 You can't break it or nothing like that, but rather it's not how it works.
00:33:12.62 --> 00:33:16.62 If you're too rigid, right, you're just going to crumble when the wiggle start coming.
00:33:16.62 --> 00:33:18.34 When the earthquake starts coming, you know?
00:33:18.34 --> 00:33:23.10 Again, this is why humility is the most important aspect or characteristic for a leader.
00:33:23.10 --> 00:33:26.22 Because when you're humble, you're able to move a little bit.
00:33:26.22 --> 00:33:28.34 You're able to take on new ideas.
00:33:28.34 --> 00:33:32.34 You're able to sway when the earthquake comes and they're adjustments.
00:33:32.34 --> 00:33:36.34 You're not just crumbling and falling down.
00:33:36.34 --> 00:33:40.18 It cannot be stressed too strongly that in talking about authoritarianism, we have been
00:33:40.18 --> 00:33:43.86 discussing people towards one end of a continuum.
00:33:43.86 --> 00:33:46.46 This is important because this is a dichotomy.
00:33:46.46 --> 00:33:48.18 This guy couldn't quite put that.
00:33:48.18 --> 00:33:50.94 He couldn't grasp that concept like you're boy, right here.
00:33:50.94 --> 00:33:52.94 Yes, sir.
00:33:52.94 --> 00:33:56.14 Between, because you had a balance at dichotomy, but here's what he says, between this
00:33:56.14 --> 00:34:01.14 and the other can be found people with all shades of opinion on the various attitudes measured.
00:34:01.14 --> 00:34:06.30 The general point is this, when discussing a authoritarianism, no value judgment is intended.
00:34:06.30 --> 00:34:11.78 Few would dispute that in moderation, many of the traits which make up the authoritarian
00:34:11.78 --> 00:34:14.70 personality have value in society.
00:34:14.70 --> 00:34:19.82 Civilization requires that there be some repression of sex and aggression, some exercise
00:34:19.82 --> 00:34:24.18 of discipline and a modicum of conformity and ordinalliness.
00:34:24.18 --> 00:34:28.78 So there's aspects of that personality which are good and that's true in the military.
00:34:28.78 --> 00:34:31.74 In fact, the military got a little bit extra.
00:34:31.74 --> 00:34:34.38 Because you got to be a little bit more conformist because you got to get the teet-you
00:34:34.38 --> 00:34:38.46 know you got to be on board, but it attracts people that are too much.
00:34:38.46 --> 00:34:38.46 Yeah.
00:34:38.46 --> 00:34:43.38 A little bit fast forward here.
00:34:43.38 --> 00:34:48.30 In other respects, however, likelihood of above average levels of authoritarianism in military
00:34:48.30 --> 00:34:53.26 personnel may well contribute toward incompetence, particularly when the authoritarian
00:34:53.26 --> 00:34:59.98 has reached a level of command where flexibility and an open mind are mandatory for success
00:34:59.98 --> 00:35:05.22 to be more specific the personality traits of authoritarianism and the associated characteristics
00:35:05.22 --> 00:35:10.22 of the closed mind and obsessive character may contribute to incompetence in the following
00:35:10.22 --> 00:35:11.22 ways.
00:35:11.22 --> 00:35:18.22 One, since authoritarianism has been found to be more dishonest, more irresponsible, more
00:35:18.22 --> 00:35:25.22 untrustworthy, more socially conforming, more suspicious than non-authoritarians, they are unlikely
00:35:25.22 --> 00:35:29.10 to make successful social leaders.
00:35:29.10 --> 00:35:33.18 A foretarians will be less likely to understand enemy intentions.
00:35:33.18 --> 00:35:34.54 I never thought of that before.
00:35:34.54 --> 00:35:36.66 Actually, here's something new for Jocco.
00:35:36.66 --> 00:35:40.18 If you're a foretarian, you're less likely to understand what the enemy is doing because
00:35:40.18 --> 00:35:43.70 you can't even understand their perspective.
00:35:43.70 --> 00:35:49.30 And to act upon information regarding such intentions as conflict with the beliefs and preconceptions
00:35:49.30 --> 00:35:53.42 which the commander might hold.
00:35:53.42 --> 00:35:54.42 Makes sense.
00:35:54.42 --> 00:36:00.54 Okay, forgive me for all the analogies by the way, I'm just reading the comments.
00:36:00.54 --> 00:36:01.54 Now this time is cameras.
00:36:01.54 --> 00:36:04.78 Or for whatever, I need to do for two.
00:36:04.78 --> 00:36:05.78 They were accurate.
00:36:05.78 --> 00:36:10.30 The person who is different among people.
00:36:10.30 --> 00:36:13.06 We'll consider a camera, or a photograph, or whatever.
00:36:13.06 --> 00:36:16.74 You have high resolution, low resolution, kind of the situation.
00:36:16.74 --> 00:36:20.22 The authoritarianism seems like a low resolution scenario.
00:36:20.22 --> 00:36:23.74 Way more black and white, way more like, oh yeah, like freaking either.
00:36:23.74 --> 00:36:24.74 It's this way.
00:36:24.74 --> 00:36:27.98 And if it's not this way, then it's obviously the other way.
00:36:27.98 --> 00:36:28.98 But you get a high-res photo.
00:36:28.98 --> 00:36:30.98 It's like, oh, that's just black.
00:36:30.98 --> 00:36:33.14 Obviously, no, no, just look closer.
00:36:33.14 --> 00:36:34.14 It's kind of great.
00:36:34.14 --> 00:36:35.70 It's actually pretty dark gray.
00:36:35.70 --> 00:36:38.74 And then even within that gray, this darker and lighter shades of gray.
00:36:38.74 --> 00:36:39.74 Or is it called?
00:36:39.74 --> 00:36:41.38 Or, oh, well, colors.
00:36:41.38 --> 00:36:42.38 What, yeah, whatever.
00:36:42.38 --> 00:36:43.38 This one might be orange.
00:36:43.38 --> 00:36:46.62 This one might be salmon.
00:36:46.62 --> 00:36:47.62 Which is a color.
00:36:47.62 --> 00:36:48.62 Yeah.
00:36:48.62 --> 00:36:49.62 Egg shill.
00:36:49.62 --> 00:36:51.62 With a Romalean type.
00:36:51.62 --> 00:36:53.90 By the way, what's that from?
00:36:53.90 --> 00:36:54.90 I can't say.
00:36:54.90 --> 00:36:59.34 No, no, no, but see what I'm saying though, where you get a low-res situation.
00:36:59.34 --> 00:37:00.34 Yeah.
00:37:00.34 --> 00:37:01.34 Yeah, they don't get it.
00:37:01.34 --> 00:37:02.34 They don't know.
00:37:02.34 --> 00:37:03.78 And then you said, what they don't know what the enemies thinking.
00:37:03.78 --> 00:37:05.34 Yeah, because they see black.
00:37:05.34 --> 00:37:06.34 But the enemies not on black.
00:37:06.34 --> 00:37:09.06 They're over here on 38% great.
00:37:09.06 --> 00:37:10.34 Yeah, exactly right.
00:37:10.34 --> 00:37:12.22 So yeah, that's just the way it's working.
00:37:12.22 --> 00:37:13.22 It's soon saying.
00:37:13.22 --> 00:37:14.58 So you got to be, oh, I'm not saying you got to be.
00:37:14.58 --> 00:37:19.26 I'm just saying it might be as the book is demonstrating more efficient.
00:37:19.26 --> 00:37:22.70 Effective to have a more nuanced perception of what's happened.
00:37:22.70 --> 00:37:25.58 Some higher as to experience.
00:37:25.58 --> 00:37:31.50 In 1954, American research showed that people with a high score on tests of a foretarianism
00:37:31.50 --> 00:37:38.18 had greater difficulty than non-foritarians in recognizing threatening messages when these
00:37:38.18 --> 00:37:40.22 were presented visually.
00:37:40.22 --> 00:37:45.38 A year later, another study confirmed this finding with threatening words that were heard
00:37:45.38 --> 00:37:47.02 instead of seen.
00:37:47.02 --> 00:37:48.38 So someone that's a foretarian.
00:37:48.38 --> 00:37:51.10 They don't even, they just don't comprehend the world accurately.
00:37:51.10 --> 00:38:00.62 Look, that is now your metaphor just became more ample in that right there.
00:38:00.62 --> 00:38:02.18 They can't see as well.
00:38:02.18 --> 00:38:03.34 They can't see as clear.
00:38:03.34 --> 00:38:04.70 They can't see the nuance.
00:38:04.70 --> 00:38:07.38 They can't see the message.
00:38:07.38 --> 00:38:11.98 Three, the inability to sacrifice cherished traditions and accept technical innovations, the
00:38:11.98 --> 00:38:15.78 history of the machine gun, the tank, and the aeroplane contained striking as an evidence
00:38:15.78 --> 00:38:17.42 of this disability.
00:38:17.42 --> 00:38:20.30 In war, an ounce of calculation is worth a ton of intuition.
00:38:20.30 --> 00:38:21.94 It also saves many lives.
00:38:21.94 --> 00:38:26.14 Number four, the under estimation of enemy ability.
00:38:26.14 --> 00:38:28.98 Number five, and he's got whole sections about each one of these.
00:38:28.98 --> 00:38:30.58 That's where you got to buy the book.
00:38:30.58 --> 00:38:35.86 Number five, an emphasis upon the importance of blind obedience and loyalty at the expense
00:38:35.86 --> 00:38:39.74 of initiative and innovation at lower levels of command.
00:38:39.74 --> 00:38:43.46 So that's just, if you lose that.
00:38:43.46 --> 00:38:49.58 So if you're in charge of the company of soldiers and your focus is on getting them to
00:38:49.58 --> 00:38:54.90 be blindly obedient because you're an authoritarian, it's bad.
00:38:54.90 --> 00:38:58.74 And you're doing it at the expense of having decentralized command.
00:38:58.74 --> 00:39:01.18 Watch out for that.
00:39:01.18 --> 00:39:03.78 Got to beware.
00:39:03.78 --> 00:39:08.38 Number six, the protection of the reputations of senior commanders and punishment of those
00:39:08.38 --> 00:39:12.26 in the lower military hierarchy if they voice any opinion.
00:39:12.26 --> 00:39:15.94 Whoever valuable in itself implies criticism of those higher up.
00:39:15.94 --> 00:39:21.98 So they don't want to hear any pushback on anything, which is again, a start contrast
00:39:21.98 --> 00:39:23.78 to what I encourage all the time.
00:39:23.78 --> 00:39:27.94 Up and down the chain of command, I want pushed back from my team.
00:39:27.94 --> 00:39:29.18 My team isn't pushing back, actually.
00:39:29.18 --> 00:39:31.02 I'm nervous.
00:39:31.02 --> 00:39:36.14 Now I think I've got blind obedience, which I don't want.
00:39:36.14 --> 00:39:37.14 Number seven, close.
00:39:37.14 --> 00:39:41.46 We were related to the foregoing effects of authoritarianism is an individual's propensity
00:39:41.46 --> 00:39:48.06 to blame others for their own shortcomings.
00:39:48.06 --> 00:39:49.78 This is the opposite of extreme ownership.
00:39:49.78 --> 00:39:56.34 So the opposite of extreme ownership is authoritarian and blaming other people.
00:39:56.34 --> 00:39:59.34 When it's soccer if I was reading this book, right now, and it just wasn't working.
00:39:59.34 --> 00:40:05.30 It was all not massive enough.
00:40:05.30 --> 00:40:08.62 All my theories were wrong.
00:40:08.62 --> 00:40:13.06 For eight, the close relationship between authoritarianism and obsessive traits has also
00:40:13.06 --> 00:40:15.26 played a significant part of military incompetence.
00:40:15.26 --> 00:40:17.62 This is a matter which we discussed earlier.
00:40:17.62 --> 00:40:25.82 Suffice it to say that the worst excesses of bull and the clinging to an across-dick ritual
00:40:25.82 --> 00:40:32.14 have played not a not inconsiderable part in holding back the military machine.
00:40:32.14 --> 00:40:39.70 So when you are hyper-obsessed OCD on little things that don't matter, this is not going
00:40:39.70 --> 00:40:41.14 to help you.
00:40:41.14 --> 00:40:44.50 Number nine, there's one trait of the authoritarian personality which at first sight may
00:40:44.50 --> 00:40:51.58 seem to have nothing to do with military incompetence, a belief in supernatural forces.
00:40:51.58 --> 00:40:53.10 The contrary is in fact the case.
00:40:53.10 --> 00:40:57.62 As a general issue, since military decision should not be based upon a proper weighing
00:40:57.62 --> 00:41:03.54 up of facts, the introduction of metaphysical variables into decision-making necessarily contributes
00:41:03.54 --> 00:41:07.78 noise which decreases the probability of decisions being correct.
00:41:07.78 --> 00:41:13.94 Concern with what the stars, foretell, or hopes and occasionally fears of the divine intervention
00:41:13.94 --> 00:41:19.86 constitute prejudices which can bias decisions away from realism in towards a wishful
00:41:19.86 --> 00:41:22.34 fantasies.
00:41:22.34 --> 00:41:26.50 That's a weird one to me because you would think that the people that were anti-authoritarian
00:41:26.50 --> 00:41:32.02 would be more superstitious but we didn't run through all the examples of all kinds of examples
00:41:32.02 --> 00:41:33.02 of that.
00:41:33.02 --> 00:41:36.22 All kinds of examples throughout history of people that are authoritarian.
00:41:36.22 --> 00:41:40.82 I mean, Hitler is a good example because he was all into the occult and all that superstitious
00:41:40.82 --> 00:41:44.86 about stuff.
00:41:44.86 --> 00:41:48.74 One of the least, number ten, one of the least attractive aspects of the authoritarian
00:41:48.74 --> 00:41:54.02 personality is his generalized hostility, what the Berkeley researchers called vilification
00:41:54.02 --> 00:41:57.90 of the human, this was a trait that was manifested to such an extreme degree by members
00:41:57.90 --> 00:41:58.90 of the Nazi SS.
00:41:58.90 --> 00:42:03.78 They commit wholesale murder not just without guilt or shame, but perhaps most surprisingly
00:42:03.78 --> 00:42:06.14 without the slightest evidence of revulsion.
00:42:06.14 --> 00:42:16.82 Then he says, finally, there is the fact that authoritarianism itself, so damaging to military
00:42:16.82 --> 00:42:22.90 endeavor will actually predispose an individual towards entering upon the very career
00:42:22.90 --> 00:42:26.62 wherein his restricted personality can wreak the most habits.
00:42:26.62 --> 00:42:30.50 Because there's what I kind of opened up with saying today.
00:42:30.50 --> 00:42:35.86 People that have these tendencies are attracted to the military and he gives a following
00:42:35.86 --> 00:42:40.90 case study case 19, Cecil or Cecil.
00:42:40.90 --> 00:42:43.42 Yeah, I guess Cecil would be a girls name one.
00:42:43.42 --> 00:42:44.42 Yes.
00:42:44.42 --> 00:42:45.42 So Cecil is a male name.
00:42:45.42 --> 00:42:46.42 Yes, sir.
00:42:46.42 --> 00:42:47.42 More of a British name.
00:42:47.42 --> 00:42:49.82 I'm never met in American dude named Cecil of you.
00:42:49.82 --> 00:42:50.82 Yes, sir.
00:42:50.82 --> 00:42:51.82 Really?
00:42:51.82 --> 00:42:52.82 Yeah.
00:42:52.82 --> 00:42:53.82 No, just one.
00:42:53.82 --> 00:42:54.82 Was he from England?
00:42:54.82 --> 00:42:55.82 No.
00:42:55.82 --> 00:42:56.82 No, not again.
00:42:56.82 --> 00:42:57.82 No, not again.
00:42:57.82 --> 00:42:58.82 Cecil.
00:42:58.82 --> 00:42:59.82 Okay.
00:42:59.82 --> 00:43:00.82 Here we go.
00:43:00.82 --> 00:43:01.82 Wait, who's Cecil peoples?
00:43:01.82 --> 00:43:02.82 Oh, that's it.
00:43:02.82 --> 00:43:03.82 That's an actor.
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:06.14 No, isn't that a UFC guy?
00:43:06.14 --> 00:43:07.14 Cecil peoples?
00:43:07.14 --> 00:43:11.06 So UFC is a commentator or a ref, maybe?
00:43:11.06 --> 00:43:12.06 I think he's a ref.
00:43:12.06 --> 00:43:13.66 I'm drawing a blank for a reason.
00:43:13.66 --> 00:43:14.66 Cecil peoples, right?
00:43:14.66 --> 00:43:16.42 You know, I Cecil people shout out.
00:43:16.42 --> 00:43:17.42 All right.
00:43:17.42 --> 00:43:21.62 I am, if I, if I'm not mistaken, he's a referee.
00:43:21.62 --> 00:43:22.62 Early on.
00:43:22.62 --> 00:43:23.62 Get your phone and go.
00:43:23.62 --> 00:43:24.62 Go, go, go, go.
00:43:24.62 --> 00:43:25.62 Seriously.
00:43:25.62 --> 00:43:31.02 I, I kind of remember him being, yeah, you might be right.
00:43:31.02 --> 00:43:32.46 Might have been a judge.
00:43:32.46 --> 00:43:33.46 Maybe he was a judge.
00:43:33.46 --> 00:43:36.54 Yeah, he seemed like he had some weird background and bare knuckle fighting or something
00:43:36.54 --> 00:43:39.26 and then kind of got early UFC activities going.
00:43:39.26 --> 00:43:43.14 So, Pee, E. O. Pope Cecil peoples.
00:43:43.14 --> 00:43:46.74 Cecil peoples is, eh, there he is.
00:43:46.74 --> 00:43:47.74 Black guy.
00:43:47.74 --> 00:43:48.74 I need support.
00:43:48.74 --> 00:43:49.74 He's a judge.
00:43:49.74 --> 00:43:52.58 Why we need to support MMA judge Cecil peoples.
00:43:52.58 --> 00:43:55.58 But I don't, from what era?
00:43:55.58 --> 00:43:56.58 Hmm.
00:43:56.58 --> 00:43:57.58 What was his background?
00:43:57.58 --> 00:44:03.46 The era that I was watching UFC, which is probably like five years ago and before.
00:44:03.46 --> 00:44:05.82 So, this is the guy that you claim to know.
00:44:05.82 --> 00:44:12.06 I knew I worked with a guy at American Movers.
00:44:12.06 --> 00:44:16.06 Cecil, um, and then there's Cecil people.
00:44:16.06 --> 00:44:17.46 All right, check.
00:44:17.46 --> 00:44:22.26 So here's Cecil R. Who is an obsessive neurotic and I wasn't going to read this thing,
00:44:22.26 --> 00:44:24.66 but I kind of have to, and I'll tell you why, and we'll get to the end.
00:44:24.66 --> 00:44:28.90 His IQ was in the bright normal range, personality testing indicated that he was very dependent
00:44:28.90 --> 00:44:34.26 on his parents, but that they were seen as being emotionally remote and extremely demanding
00:44:34.26 --> 00:44:35.66 infancy.
00:44:35.66 --> 00:44:38.82 He expressed strong feelings of aggression and anger.
00:44:38.82 --> 00:44:43.22 He seemed most interested in the history of wars and in playing war games.
00:44:43.22 --> 00:44:47.78 He shot darts with vigor and delight in the therapist's playroom and if given a choice
00:44:47.78 --> 00:44:52.06 would choose war games, his parents said he refused to play with other children on
00:44:52.06 --> 00:44:56.66 last day, others did exactly what they told him what he told them to do.
00:44:56.66 --> 00:45:02.38 Cecil said, when he grew up, he wanted to be a general.
00:45:02.38 --> 00:45:05.66 So, there you go.
00:45:05.66 --> 00:45:10.62 That's the kind of personality we don't want joined in the military, but that is fired
00:45:10.62 --> 00:45:14.38 up to join the military.
00:45:14.38 --> 00:45:19.26 Next chapter 23, mothers of incompetence were going kind of heavy, not going to go to
00:45:19.26 --> 00:45:23.22 deep into this chapter because it's going a little bit into the psychology world, which
00:45:23.22 --> 00:45:28.22 again, I think this, some of the psychology is a little bit outdated.
00:45:28.22 --> 00:45:30.42 This is coming from me and I'm those psychologists.
00:45:30.42 --> 00:45:32.82 Sounds like a close mine scenario.
00:45:32.82 --> 00:45:33.82 We'll open it up.
00:45:33.82 --> 00:45:34.82 Okay, two points.
00:45:34.82 --> 00:45:35.82 Follow me.
00:45:35.82 --> 00:45:36.82 You caught me.
00:45:36.82 --> 00:45:37.82 I'm busted.
00:45:37.82 --> 00:45:41.30 For the reader, not previously versed in the psychology of authoritarianism, the preceding
00:45:41.30 --> 00:45:46.46 chapter may have come as something to surprise at first sight, the traits of orderliness,
00:45:46.46 --> 00:45:49.22 tough mindedness, obedience to authority.
00:45:49.22 --> 00:45:56.78 Punetiveness and the rest well may have seemed the very embodiment of hard-hitting masculinity
00:45:56.78 --> 00:46:00.22 ideally suited to the job of being a soldier.
00:46:00.22 --> 00:46:02.26 That is an epic statement, right?
00:46:02.26 --> 00:46:03.26 All that's exact.
00:46:03.26 --> 00:46:04.46 And that's what so many people think.
00:46:04.46 --> 00:46:08.38 So many people think that is what we look at foreign military.
00:46:08.38 --> 00:46:13.14 Unfortunately, as represented in the authoritarian personality, they are only skin deep,
00:46:13.14 --> 00:46:17.78 a brittle crust of defenses against feelings of weakness and inadequacy.
00:46:17.78 --> 00:46:21.78 The authoritarian keeps up his spirits by whistling in the dark.
00:46:21.78 --> 00:46:22.78 He is frightened.
00:46:22.78 --> 00:46:26.90 He is the frightened child who wears the armor of a giant.
00:46:26.90 --> 00:46:31.70 His mind is a closed, is a door locked and bolted against that which he fears the most
00:46:31.70 --> 00:46:32.70 himself.
00:46:32.70 --> 00:46:37.42 I didn't get much out of that, but when I did get a lot out of, when I did get a lot out
00:46:37.42 --> 00:46:43.14 of his the fact that when you hear these personality traits, tough mindedness, obedience
00:46:43.14 --> 00:46:45.18 to authority, it sounds like that's what you want.
00:46:45.18 --> 00:46:48.70 You want people to be, you want to answer, you want your soldier to be, you don't.
00:46:48.70 --> 00:46:49.70 It's not what you want.
00:46:49.70 --> 00:46:54.70 It's not what we're looking for.
00:46:54.70 --> 00:46:57.02 Fast forward a little bit.
00:46:57.02 --> 00:46:59.78 Before going on, there's one further point of concerns, the distinction that has been drawn
00:46:59.78 --> 00:47:05.18 between irrational authoritarianism as dealt with here and so called rational authoritarianism.
00:47:05.18 --> 00:47:10.74 So this is just a clarification here.
00:47:10.74 --> 00:47:17.62 By the latter is meant the readiness to accept the no-bay, the dictates of irrational authority.
00:47:17.62 --> 00:47:18.62 Cool.
00:47:18.62 --> 00:47:19.62 There's such a thing.
00:47:19.62 --> 00:47:22.98 He's basically making a distinction here.
00:47:22.98 --> 00:47:30.94 An irrational, antipathy toward all authority is evident in some cases of student militancy,
00:47:30.94 --> 00:47:35.82 may just be, maybe just as neurotic as non-adaptive as a predisposition toward irrational
00:47:35.82 --> 00:47:36.82 authoritarianism.
00:47:36.82 --> 00:47:42.74 The common denominator of irrational authoritarianism and blind anarchy is that both states
00:47:42.74 --> 00:47:49.54 of mind are compulsive and derived from an underlying ego pathology.
00:47:49.54 --> 00:47:54.14 In fact, this distinction between rational and irrational authoritarianism has been implied
00:47:54.14 --> 00:47:55.38 throughout this book.
00:47:55.38 --> 00:47:59.94 Without the exercise, this is why I had to read this part, without the exercise and acceptance
00:47:59.94 --> 00:48:06.14 of rational authority, without certain minimal levels of discipline, and even without certain
00:48:06.14 --> 00:48:10.78 features of bullshit, military organizations would cease to function.
00:48:10.78 --> 00:48:17.22 This is something I have to talk about sometime with clients at Esslime Front because
00:48:17.22 --> 00:48:21.34 decentralized command, we want to have decentralized command, decentralized command, we want
00:48:21.34 --> 00:48:24.90 subordinates to be able to make choices and make decisions.
00:48:24.90 --> 00:48:29.26 And occasionally I'll get a group that's going to wild with that.
00:48:29.26 --> 00:48:32.58 And all of a sudden, we're nothing is centralized anymore.
00:48:32.58 --> 00:48:39.62 And I have to bring up the fact that, hey, guess what kind of uniform every guy in task
00:48:39.62 --> 00:48:41.94 in a bruiser or a matching uniform?
00:48:41.94 --> 00:48:42.94 Why?
00:48:42.94 --> 00:48:46.46 Because we couldn't have some guy that was wearing a pair of blue jeans and a sweatshirt
00:48:46.46 --> 00:48:50.86 out in Ramadi because they would look, they wouldn't look the same.
00:48:50.86 --> 00:48:52.02 And therefore they get shot.
00:48:52.02 --> 00:48:53.62 What happens if I run out of bullets?
00:48:53.62 --> 00:48:54.62 Guess what?
00:48:54.62 --> 00:48:57.62 I can get bullets from someone else and because we're all using the same weapon.
00:48:57.62 --> 00:48:59.98 What about my radio?
00:48:59.98 --> 00:49:03.30 I can use my radio and I can pick up your radio and use it to why because we're using
00:49:03.30 --> 00:49:04.30 the same radio.
00:49:04.30 --> 00:49:10.38 So you have to have some level of centralization, some level of authoritarianism that
00:49:10.38 --> 00:49:14.22 we're all going to kind of be on the same page.
00:49:14.22 --> 00:49:18.10 He says then, it's necessary to labor this point because of some of the semantic confusion
00:49:18.10 --> 00:49:20.54 regarding the term authoritarian.
00:49:20.54 --> 00:49:25.26 Throughout this book, it refers to irrational authoritarianism for the so-called rational
00:49:25.26 --> 00:49:31.06 foretars and we prefer the praise, autocratic behavior, the terms are not synonymous.
00:49:31.06 --> 00:49:34.42 Whereas the autocratic exercise of tight control in the situation demands that the authoritarian
00:49:34.42 --> 00:49:39.02 is himself tightly controlled no matter what the external situation.
00:49:39.02 --> 00:49:42.38 A little semantics there.
00:49:42.38 --> 00:49:51.50 He goes in this next chapter, education of the cult of muscular Christianity.
00:49:51.50 --> 00:49:59.58 This is where he starts talking about the British schools, how these kids were raised
00:49:59.58 --> 00:50:04.22 in sort of like this musk, what he calls muscular Christianity, not kids, but some of the
00:50:04.22 --> 00:50:08.26 kids in this timeframe were raised this way.
00:50:08.26 --> 00:50:13.50 Here's some of the things that are highlighted by the reasons for this stultifying educational
00:50:13.50 --> 00:50:20.02 program are no doubt many and various, but to deserve particular consideration.
00:50:20.02 --> 00:50:23.86 So this is the education program that some of these kids were subjected to.
00:50:23.86 --> 00:50:29.10 The first resides in the belief that enforced application to unpleasant boring tasks develops
00:50:29.10 --> 00:50:36.06 character and the second that any truly intellectual exercise by which is meant the cultivation
00:50:36.06 --> 00:50:41.58 of independent thinking as opposed to wrote learning harms that fine sense of loyalty
00:50:41.58 --> 00:50:50.70 and obedience which such schools strive to inculcate to think is to question and to question
00:50:50.70 --> 00:50:51.90 is to have doubts.
00:50:51.90 --> 00:50:57.42 So you get some examples of how these kids were raised, what they did at these schools,
00:50:57.42 --> 00:51:02.90 they were playing sports, they were do hazing rituals and memorizing things and it was
00:51:02.90 --> 00:51:06.66 all, I mean this is this is true to this day, we've got this sort of school system which
00:51:06.66 --> 00:51:08.74 is meant to teach you to be a good worker.
00:51:08.74 --> 00:51:10.54 That's what it's meant to do.
00:51:10.54 --> 00:51:13.42 It's meant to teach you to be a good worker.
00:51:13.42 --> 00:51:16.22 They don't want, that's why they structure things.
00:51:16.22 --> 00:51:20.42 It's like hey, some of the stuff that you learn in school has no value whatsoever.
00:51:20.42 --> 00:51:25.54 They're just trying to get you to follow the rules, do what they say, get on board with
00:51:25.54 --> 00:51:29.86 the program, follow in line with the authoritarian rulers.
00:51:29.86 --> 00:51:31.90 So we gotta be careful of that.
00:51:31.90 --> 00:51:38.46 Yeah, yeah, sometimes you feel like they, or whatever they are, are doing it on purpose
00:51:38.46 --> 00:51:43.22 and sometimes you just feel like, I think this is just some curriculum that no one had
00:51:43.22 --> 00:51:47.10 the like gusts to do to just be like hey, we're doing it overhaul.
00:51:47.10 --> 00:51:48.82 Yeah, I think you're right.
00:51:48.82 --> 00:51:54.26 I think that at some point, like right now, let's face it, if you would go ground zero
00:51:54.26 --> 00:51:57.54 and restart your educational system and America would be totally different than it is right
00:51:57.54 --> 00:51:58.54 now.
00:51:58.54 --> 00:51:59.54 Yeah.
00:51:59.54 --> 00:52:00.54 Well, it is slowly changing.
00:52:00.54 --> 00:52:03.58 It is slowly changing and I'm not even sure that the way that they're changing is the right
00:52:03.58 --> 00:52:04.58 direction.
00:52:04.58 --> 00:52:07.46 I think they're taking advantage of the fact that it might not have been the best and they're
00:52:07.46 --> 00:52:10.22 changing it to make it worse in some cases.
00:52:10.22 --> 00:52:14.46 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think in a, from a social standpoint, I think they might have
00:52:14.46 --> 00:52:16.90 kind of too hard in a certain direction.
00:52:16.90 --> 00:52:18.38 Kind of crazy sometimes.
00:52:18.38 --> 00:52:19.90 What kids are learning in school?
00:52:19.90 --> 00:52:22.70 Did you start being in some cases, what kids are learning in school?
00:52:22.70 --> 00:52:23.70 Yeah.
00:52:23.70 --> 00:52:28.02 My only point of reference is my, the elementary school, so my kids go to school.
00:52:28.02 --> 00:52:30.70 I got the full spectrum from elementary school through college.
00:52:30.70 --> 00:52:31.70 I got it all.
00:52:31.70 --> 00:52:32.70 I got it all.
00:52:32.70 --> 00:52:37.42 Do you think, um, what was I just thinking about just now?
00:52:37.42 --> 00:52:39.78 And I'm not really in support of it.
00:52:39.78 --> 00:52:40.78 Yeah.
00:52:40.78 --> 00:52:41.78 Oh, okay.
00:52:41.78 --> 00:52:47.46 Do you think, and I don't know the answer to this, but I just, I do kind of consider the other
00:52:47.46 --> 00:52:52.70 side of this, you know, how you, how you, how you just said, um, the school kind of is structured
00:52:52.70 --> 00:52:54.66 to provide or to develop good workers.
00:52:54.66 --> 00:52:55.66 Right.
00:52:55.66 --> 00:52:59.66 Aren't most people workers anyway?
00:52:59.66 --> 00:53:00.66 Not necessarily.
00:53:00.66 --> 00:53:04.10 No, no, you want to know something what I think is messed up now is I think a lot of times
00:53:04.10 --> 00:53:11.26 the school right now is to develop people to go to college and feed the academic growth
00:53:11.26 --> 00:53:12.26 of colleges.
00:53:12.26 --> 00:53:13.26 Yeah.
00:53:13.26 --> 00:53:15.86 But even that, hey, we're just trying to get you to get, oh, you know, it'd be good for
00:53:15.86 --> 00:53:20.26 you to get a degree in, bringing basket weaving or whatever.
00:53:20.26 --> 00:53:21.94 And no one needs a degree in that.
00:53:21.94 --> 00:53:23.74 There's a lot of degrees that you get that you don't need.
00:53:23.74 --> 00:53:25.46 If you want to learn about that stuff, go read about it.
00:53:25.46 --> 00:53:31.34 Don't pay $200,000 and go into debt to learn about something that has no, it doesn't
00:53:31.34 --> 00:53:32.50 give you a skill set.
00:53:32.50 --> 00:53:36.42 I always felt like a social problem to me.
00:53:36.42 --> 00:53:41.06 It felt like I don't freaking know when I was a kid.
00:53:41.06 --> 00:53:45.66 Not not a kid, but when I was, when I joined the military, I already, I used to use the
00:53:45.66 --> 00:53:46.66 term.
00:53:46.66 --> 00:53:49.06 I don't know if it's ever caught on or I don't know if I've ever heard it, but educational
00:53:49.06 --> 00:53:50.06 inflation.
00:53:50.06 --> 00:53:53.70 Because when I was a kid, if you dropped out of high school, you could still get a job and
00:53:53.70 --> 00:53:55.62 have a normal life.
00:53:55.62 --> 00:54:00.38 Then as I got to high school, it was, hey, it was you got to finish high school.
00:54:00.38 --> 00:54:03.34 If you don't finish high school, you can't get a job blah, blah, blah.
00:54:03.34 --> 00:54:05.14 Then it was that I joined the military.
00:54:05.14 --> 00:54:06.34 Thank God.
00:54:06.34 --> 00:54:07.54 I joined the military.
00:54:07.54 --> 00:54:11.90 But as I joined the military, it was, hey, you know, you really need to really get your,
00:54:11.90 --> 00:54:13.58 whatever, what's a two year degree?
00:54:13.58 --> 00:54:14.58 You're so serious.
00:54:14.58 --> 00:54:16.22 So she, you need to get your social, it's good, it's good.
00:54:16.22 --> 00:54:17.22 So good.
00:54:17.22 --> 00:54:18.22 And then it became matchers.
00:54:18.22 --> 00:54:21.06 And now you've got kids that are going to get in their masters and then they're
00:54:21.06 --> 00:54:22.38 doctorate.
00:54:22.38 --> 00:54:29.26 They spend, they spend their 33 years old, 35 years old, 29 years old.
00:54:29.26 --> 00:54:32.22 For their even getting a job.
00:54:32.22 --> 00:54:34.42 And they've backed up, I mean, this is all now.
00:54:34.42 --> 00:54:35.42 It's all common.
00:54:35.42 --> 00:54:41.98 Like everyone's racking up $3,400, $200,300,000 worth of debt.
00:54:41.98 --> 00:54:48.34 And the skill set that they got in whatever degree they got, it gets them a 29,000 of
00:54:48.34 --> 00:54:55.30 not gonna probably not probably a $38,000 a year job as a whatever, you know, whatever.
00:54:55.30 --> 00:54:56.30 Right?
00:54:56.30 --> 00:55:00.34 Right?
00:55:00.34 --> 00:55:01.06 Whereas if you would have gone to, if you would have dropped out of high school and become an apprentice
00:55:01.06 --> 00:55:06.26 welder right now, you'd be making 128 grand a year because you're a hard worker.
00:55:06.26 --> 00:55:09.78 And by the way, if you're smart, you start, you know, you get, you figure out that welding
00:55:09.78 --> 00:55:14.38 thing and you buy a couple welding, a couple welding machines.
00:55:14.38 --> 00:55:17.58 And you're like, you know what I can get to guys, I can apprentice them, I can teach them.
00:55:17.58 --> 00:55:18.86 Boom, you can grow.
00:55:18.86 --> 00:55:20.30 You can make stuff happen.
00:55:20.30 --> 00:55:25.22 Meanwhile, the person that has $38,000 a year job, they actually have no skill set.
00:55:25.22 --> 00:55:33.14 So, I think a lot of the educational system right now is a feeder program for the college system,
00:55:33.14 --> 00:55:37.26 which is gonna charge people money and this is sort of like the housing crash too.
00:55:37.26 --> 00:55:42.70 So the housing crash came because the government was loaning money or backing up loans
00:55:42.70 --> 00:55:45.74 to people that aren't gonna be able to afford it.
00:55:45.74 --> 00:55:50.70 That was what one of the causes, one of the primary causing of the housing crash.
00:55:50.70 --> 00:55:55.14 Right now, the government backs up these loans that these people get.
00:55:55.14 --> 00:55:58.62 And so they're allowed to get loans for $200, $300,000.
00:55:58.62 --> 00:56:03.54 And they don't realize it, they should, but they don't realize that, hey, you know,
00:56:03.54 --> 00:56:07.74 long it takes to pay off a $300,000 loan, which is by the way, is the only loan that you can't
00:56:07.74 --> 00:56:08.74 go bankrupt from.
00:56:08.74 --> 00:56:11.38 It's gonna, and you're making $39,000 a year.
00:56:11.38 --> 00:56:16.82 And by the way, my, my daughter just graduated college in the spring and a really good college.
00:56:16.82 --> 00:56:23.94 And her friends are making $39,000 a year, $42,000 a year.
00:56:23.94 --> 00:56:27.42 Like they're not making a lot of money.
00:56:27.42 --> 00:56:35.26 So I think a lot of the, what used to feed the workers, now feeds into this, into this educational
00:56:35.26 --> 00:56:39.18 nightmare of college debt and loans and all that.
00:56:39.18 --> 00:56:42.10 That's what's kind of nice about what we're doing at origin because at origin, you don't
00:56:42.10 --> 00:56:43.10 need to college education.
00:56:43.10 --> 00:56:45.86 You can go get a job and get a skill.
00:56:45.86 --> 00:56:46.86 We have a career.
00:56:46.86 --> 00:56:47.86 Right.
00:56:47.86 --> 00:56:52.42 And we got people that have careers now that have learned to skill, that's a highly valuable
00:56:52.42 --> 00:56:53.82 skill.
00:56:53.82 --> 00:56:59.94 And they don't have any debt because they didn't go and study basket weaving for four years
00:56:59.94 --> 00:57:01.94 at $42,000 a year.
00:57:01.94 --> 00:57:03.94 That's getting late.
00:57:03.94 --> 00:57:05.94 And how he skits a better.
00:57:05.94 --> 00:57:09.74 Oh, it almost seems like a basket weaving would be a better skill than some of the degrees
00:57:09.74 --> 00:57:10.74 that people are getting.
00:57:10.74 --> 00:57:11.74 Right.
00:57:11.74 --> 00:57:12.74 I would basically be a skill.
00:57:12.74 --> 00:57:14.74 You can sell baskets.
00:57:14.74 --> 00:57:18.26 But they need to stop harassing basket weavers.
00:57:18.26 --> 00:57:19.26 No, bro.
00:57:19.26 --> 00:57:23.66 It's almost, but it feels, I'm not a economist.
00:57:23.66 --> 00:57:26.74 Or nothing like this, you know that.
00:57:26.74 --> 00:57:30.46 It kind of seems like that there's certain times and then the education is kind of like
00:57:30.46 --> 00:57:32.18 trying to facilitate those times.
00:57:32.18 --> 00:57:38.10 Let me have people running the education and then the times change and then education just
00:57:38.10 --> 00:57:42.22 follows up with the change, but just way, way too late.
00:57:42.22 --> 00:57:45.74 It might even be 50 to 70 years late.
00:57:45.74 --> 00:57:46.74 But yeah.
00:57:46.74 --> 00:57:48.30 And then things, so now think about it, consider that.
00:57:48.30 --> 00:57:54.78 So now that now it changes from like just straight up factory workers to, you know,
00:57:54.78 --> 00:57:57.10 a little bit more advanced workers types.
00:57:57.10 --> 00:57:58.10 Right.
00:57:58.10 --> 00:58:01.02 So now it's like, okay, really the change that should have been made long time ago is
00:58:01.02 --> 00:58:04.82 for you to be influenced to go to college, get a higher education.
00:58:04.82 --> 00:58:05.98 Right.
00:58:05.98 --> 00:58:09.38 Because you have higher level jobs, generally speaking, you know, lower level jobs,
00:58:09.38 --> 00:58:10.86 obviously can exist and all this stuff.
00:58:10.86 --> 00:58:12.66 But just generally speaking, it's just general.
00:58:12.66 --> 00:58:16.46 So boom, now everyone should be going to college long time ago.
00:58:16.46 --> 00:58:17.54 They should be doing that.
00:58:17.54 --> 00:58:20.94 If they want to get a degree that creates way more opportunities back then, there's not
00:58:20.94 --> 00:58:23.26 all these crazy degrees like now there's plenty of degrees.
00:58:23.26 --> 00:58:27.18 When I went to college, like they started doing this program called liberal freaking studies,
00:58:27.18 --> 00:58:31.78 right, which in concept, concept, it's good.
00:58:31.78 --> 00:58:36.74 The concept is good, but probably got to do is get your little degree approved.
00:58:36.74 --> 00:58:38.42 And you can just study whatever you want.
00:58:38.42 --> 00:58:42.06 Essentially, be like, yeah, my degree is in this, as long as the title was approved,
00:58:42.06 --> 00:58:43.06 you can get it.
00:58:43.06 --> 00:58:45.66 It's called liberal studies, but it's, and then you have a title for it.
00:58:45.66 --> 00:58:49.26 Again, you start doing it just for the sake of getting a degree.
00:58:49.26 --> 00:58:50.26 Right.
00:58:50.26 --> 00:58:52.50 When you get out of college, you know, you, you could be jammed up.
00:58:52.50 --> 00:58:56.54 That's what I just said exactly right, but okay, and that's the later part of it.
00:58:56.54 --> 00:59:01.26 But so now you have, and when I say it's a social thing or it feels like a social thing,
00:59:01.26 --> 00:59:04.86 it's kind of like people are still stuck in that little zone that's like, it is
00:59:04.86 --> 00:59:06.02 beneficial to go to college.
00:59:06.02 --> 00:59:08.02 Because there was a point where it's not on that thing.
00:59:08.02 --> 00:59:10.62 So you think that they think that, oh, what are you doing?
00:59:10.62 --> 00:59:11.62 I'm going to go to college.
00:59:11.62 --> 00:59:12.82 Because the day is going on the path.
00:59:12.82 --> 00:59:13.82 Yeah.
00:59:13.82 --> 00:59:14.82 And then it realized that it's not the path.
00:59:14.82 --> 00:59:15.82 That's not the reality right now.
00:59:15.82 --> 00:59:17.82 That's all much has changed.
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:21.58 And then you have all these people who, like back in the day, you said people can drop
00:59:21.58 --> 00:59:22.62 out of high school and get a job.
00:59:22.62 --> 00:59:25.26 Because yeah, you can drop out of high school because all you have to do is know how to
00:59:25.26 --> 00:59:28.34 read and do basic arithmetic and get a job somewhere.
00:59:28.34 --> 00:59:32.94 Like at a factory or at it, you know, one of the jobs that were freaking prevalent for
00:59:32.94 --> 00:59:36.78 those times as times change, you need a little bit more education now for these jobs.
00:59:36.78 --> 00:59:37.78 What do you end on true?
00:59:37.78 --> 00:59:38.78 What?
00:59:38.78 --> 00:59:45.94 There are always, there's, I mean, there is massive jobs that are, you know, carpentry,
00:59:45.94 --> 00:59:50.54 concretes or plumber, electrician, automatic drive.
00:59:50.54 --> 00:59:55.74 Like there's all these jobs that you definitely do not need a college education to have.
00:59:55.74 --> 00:59:56.74 Yes, sir.
00:59:56.74 --> 00:59:57.74 Do not need it.
00:59:57.74 --> 01:00:03.78 And those are awesome jobs and those, those, those people go out and build America.
01:00:03.78 --> 01:00:06.74 But to your point, you're talking about right now.
01:00:06.74 --> 01:00:11.74 Those jobs, fullies is, but here's two, you're point.
01:00:11.74 --> 01:00:17.74 A lot of people would say, okay, hey, what should I do with my life?
01:00:17.74 --> 01:00:23.06 And the first nine things that come up on their list are go to college, go to college,
01:00:23.06 --> 01:00:26.66 go to college, go to college, where is it when I was in high school.
01:00:26.66 --> 01:00:30.14 Maybe the first thing would be go to college, but the second thing was like becoming a
01:00:30.14 --> 01:00:32.14 apprentice electrician.
01:00:32.14 --> 01:00:35.38 You know, like I took electricity in high school.
01:00:35.38 --> 01:00:39.82 I was saying that was kind of the social kind of, I think that was way more normal.
01:00:39.82 --> 01:00:43.62 There wasn't, there wasn't the mandatory track to college.
01:00:43.62 --> 01:00:48.14 And I think nowadays, almost every kid is being told, go to college, go to college, go
01:00:48.14 --> 01:00:53.62 to college instead of saying, hey, you can go and become an apprentice electrician.
01:00:53.62 --> 01:00:55.22 And that's a freaking great job.
01:00:55.22 --> 01:00:56.98 And you can have a great life.
01:00:56.98 --> 01:01:01.26 And you can contribute to society in a massive way, doing something you enjoy.
01:01:01.26 --> 01:01:05.34 Because look, when I was in high school, I didn't want to be looking at books.
01:01:05.34 --> 01:01:06.34 Right?
01:01:06.34 --> 01:01:09.10 I would much rather be an electrician.
01:01:09.10 --> 01:01:11.22 Much rather be an electrician.
01:01:11.22 --> 01:01:12.22 Yeah.
01:01:12.22 --> 01:01:18.06 And yeah, I think the zone where, okay, basically break it into these two things, where the
01:01:18.06 --> 01:01:22.14 social influence, like, hey, you should go to college or you should whatever or it's okay
01:01:22.14 --> 01:01:24.22 not to go to college, you can just get a job here, whatever.
01:01:24.22 --> 01:01:26.58 This, that passes and changes through time.
01:01:26.58 --> 01:01:30.34 The social, to me, the social part is lagging, like way behind the reality.
01:01:30.34 --> 01:01:31.58 Yes, that's what I'm saying.
01:01:31.58 --> 01:01:32.58 Yes.
01:01:32.58 --> 01:01:36.38 That's a little zone where it was the best to go to college if you had that opportunity.
01:01:36.38 --> 01:01:38.38 That was the zone.
01:01:38.38 --> 01:01:41.70 Right now, socially, the influence is still in that zone.
01:01:41.70 --> 01:01:44.10 They're still saying, it's starting to change, though.
01:01:44.10 --> 01:01:47.06 You start to hear people being like, hey, college, you know, you're going to be able to
01:01:47.06 --> 01:01:48.06 say that stuff.
01:01:48.06 --> 01:01:50.02 Yes, but it's, I think it's still there.
01:01:50.02 --> 01:01:55.90 The reality on the streets is bro, college is for a handful of people and that's it.
01:01:55.90 --> 01:01:56.90 Yeah.
01:01:56.90 --> 01:01:59.50 I want to say, yeah, there's people out there that are actually hiring.
01:01:59.50 --> 01:02:00.90 They're not looking for college degrees.
01:02:00.90 --> 01:02:03.66 And I'm talking to like, I think Peter Teal is one of them.
01:02:03.66 --> 01:02:06.14 And he's out there saying, we'll test.
01:02:06.14 --> 01:02:09.74 I don't know if they got a testing program, but they're saying we just want smart people.
01:02:09.74 --> 01:02:11.46 It doesn't matter where you want to college or not.
01:02:11.46 --> 01:02:12.86 That's, or freaking legit.
01:02:12.86 --> 01:02:17.62 And here's how you know, here's how you kind of, it's kind of like a finger on the
01:02:17.62 --> 01:02:18.62 pot.
01:02:18.62 --> 01:02:21.46 Like this is how you can kind of tell that people are still in the zone of like college is a good
01:02:21.46 --> 01:02:22.46 thing.
01:02:22.46 --> 01:02:26.78 You can be like, oh, yeah, that guy has a degree from Harvard.
01:02:26.78 --> 01:02:29.22 It's like a total appeal appeal to authority.
01:02:29.22 --> 01:02:33.14 The college being the authority by the way, you don't even have to say what he has a degree
01:02:33.14 --> 01:02:34.14 from.
01:02:34.14 --> 01:02:36.02 You can say he has a degree from Harvard.
01:02:36.02 --> 01:02:39.50 And that automatically, I'm not saying that's it, but I'm just saying that in and
01:02:39.50 --> 01:02:42.34 of itself is a point, like a positive thing.
01:02:42.34 --> 01:02:43.34 Yeah.
01:02:43.34 --> 01:02:44.34 I'm saying.
01:02:44.34 --> 01:02:45.34 Yeah.
01:02:45.34 --> 01:02:46.58 You can ask the zone, there'll be like so.
01:02:46.58 --> 01:02:47.58 What's it in?
01:02:47.58 --> 01:02:48.58 What's he doing?
01:02:48.58 --> 01:02:50.74 What's one is I actually hear that right now.
01:02:50.74 --> 01:02:55.74 I'm starting to, I, and people that I know for sure are starting to hear like, oh,
01:02:55.74 --> 01:02:57.54 that person has their MBA or whatever.
01:02:57.54 --> 01:02:58.54 Yeah, whatever.
01:02:58.54 --> 01:03:00.54 Yeah, it's a we're already getting there.
01:03:00.54 --> 01:03:02.06 It's not getting there.
01:03:02.06 --> 01:03:06.06 But when moving in that direction, I hear of those comments.
01:03:06.06 --> 01:03:07.06 Check.
01:03:07.06 --> 01:03:09.06 Back to education here.
01:03:09.06 --> 01:03:14.14 Finally, and perhaps the most fatal of all the private schools ethic of honor and fair
01:03:14.14 --> 01:03:15.14 play.
01:03:15.14 --> 01:03:21.02 So admirable in itself leads to disastrous results when mistakenly imputed to those like
01:03:21.02 --> 01:03:23.78 Hitler who play the game by different center rules.
01:03:23.78 --> 01:03:27.06 So these kids were told, hey, you got to follow the rules.
01:03:27.06 --> 01:03:28.58 And this we play with honor.
01:03:28.58 --> 01:03:29.66 And then Hitler's like, oh, really?
01:03:29.66 --> 01:03:30.86 Watch this.
01:03:30.86 --> 01:03:36.30 This particular weakness of military endeavor continued to feature in many subsequent
01:03:36.30 --> 01:03:37.30 campaigns.
01:03:37.30 --> 01:03:43.02 Indeed is no exaggeration to say that an absence of adequate reconnaissance that refusal
01:03:43.02 --> 01:03:48.66 to believe intelligence reports and a general horror of spying have tended to keep our
01:03:48.66 --> 01:03:52.42 armies wrapped in cocoons of catastrophic ignorance.
01:03:52.42 --> 01:03:56.66 This fatal preference for honorable ignorance rather than useful knowledge, clean by
01:03:56.66 --> 01:04:02.58 devious means was not confined to soldiers in the field, but as an attitude of mind permeated
01:04:02.58 --> 01:04:05.06 the highest levels of all military intelligence.
01:04:05.06 --> 01:04:08.58 So another thing, this is what these kids got educated to do.
01:04:08.58 --> 01:04:11.30 They got educated to live with honor.
01:04:11.30 --> 01:04:12.62 That means we're not going to sneak around.
01:04:12.62 --> 01:04:13.62 We're not going to cheat.
01:04:13.62 --> 01:04:14.98 I had to watch out for that.
01:04:14.98 --> 01:04:18.54 Sometimes you get the like, well, I, these for cowards.
01:04:18.54 --> 01:04:19.94 Like, okay, we get it.
01:04:19.94 --> 01:04:20.94 That's for cowards.
01:04:20.94 --> 01:04:21.94 But as well.
01:04:21.94 --> 01:04:22.94 I, E.D.s, roadside.
01:04:22.94 --> 01:04:24.54 All right, we try to go that out.
01:04:24.54 --> 01:04:25.54 You know, that's a coward.
01:04:25.54 --> 01:04:26.54 Yeah, sure.
01:04:26.54 --> 01:04:27.54 It is.
01:04:27.54 --> 01:04:28.54 Guess what?
01:04:28.54 --> 01:04:30.22 We have to contend with it just because it's cowardly.
01:04:30.22 --> 01:04:31.22 It doesn't mean it's going to go away.
01:04:31.22 --> 01:04:34.42 It doesn't mean it doesn't produce dead bodies and main bodies.
01:04:34.42 --> 01:04:36.54 Is it cowardly?
01:04:36.54 --> 01:04:37.54 Yes, it is.
01:04:37.54 --> 01:04:38.54 How do we counter it?
01:04:38.54 --> 01:04:39.54 Hmm.
01:04:39.54 --> 01:04:42.62 So you put some sniper overwatch on some roads and shwack some people.
01:04:42.62 --> 01:04:44.54 That's how you counter it.
01:04:44.54 --> 01:04:51.74 Like a reformed, because enormously successful, burglar, who self-righteously puts down his
01:04:51.74 --> 01:04:58.50 gemmy to take up proselytizing on the evils of crime, we took to repudiating these very
01:04:58.50 --> 01:05:05.02 traits, push cleverness, ruthless and sheer naked aggression that it put us where we are.
01:05:05.02 --> 01:05:10.42 The reason that, so what he's saying is, you like a criminal that sort of makes it and
01:05:10.42 --> 01:05:14.18 like all of a sudden puts down his thieving tools and starts saying, you know, thieving
01:05:14.18 --> 01:05:16.06 it's bad and you're going to be right just wet.
01:05:16.06 --> 01:05:18.50 But he's forgetting about how he got there.
01:05:18.50 --> 01:05:22.30 And what he's what the point he's making here is we can have a tendency to do that.
01:05:22.30 --> 01:05:28.90 Like, hey, in war, if you got to be brutal, we're on top because we were brutal.
01:05:28.90 --> 01:05:33.94 We're on top because we spied and you know, broke shit and killed people.
01:05:33.94 --> 01:05:36.78 That's what got us here and we can't now set up here.
01:05:36.78 --> 01:05:39.90 So let's all roll.
01:05:39.90 --> 01:05:43.06 You got to be careful about that.
01:05:43.06 --> 01:05:49.30 Now we get to part three of this book.
01:05:49.30 --> 01:05:52.50 Interestingly enough, you want to hear what quote it starts off, there's no bad regiments
01:05:52.50 --> 01:05:53.50 only bad officers.
01:05:53.50 --> 01:05:55.62 All right, we've heard Napoleon say it.
01:05:55.62 --> 01:06:02.10 We've heard hackworth said, we've heard echelon front say we know that quote is an extreme
01:06:02.10 --> 01:06:03.10 ownership.
01:06:03.10 --> 01:06:04.26 Well, it's we're using a different quote.
01:06:04.26 --> 01:06:07.62 No bad teams, only bad leaders is what we said.
01:06:07.62 --> 01:06:08.62 Did we steal it?
01:06:08.62 --> 01:06:12.34 Yes, we stole it from hackworth.
01:06:12.34 --> 01:06:20.50 And hackworth steal it from field martial lord slim who is in World War I World War II wounded
01:06:20.50 --> 01:06:25.30 three times and guess what, he stole it from Napoleon.
01:06:25.30 --> 01:06:26.30 So we're stealing it.
01:06:26.30 --> 01:06:27.30 We're using it.
01:06:27.30 --> 01:06:28.30 Can't steal.
01:06:28.30 --> 01:06:29.30 It's free.
01:06:29.30 --> 01:06:30.30 Okay.
01:06:30.30 --> 01:06:33.30 We're attributing.
01:06:33.30 --> 01:06:38.90 Also too much of history is written as though men had no feelings, no childhood, no bodily
01:06:38.90 --> 01:06:49.38 senses, which is something that I have tried with all my might, with this podcast to make
01:06:49.38 --> 01:06:53.58 sure that history is written.
01:06:53.58 --> 01:07:00.14 And it's clear that these men had feelings, had bodily senses, had childhoods and beyond
01:07:00.14 --> 01:07:02.50 that had hopes and dreams for the future.
01:07:02.50 --> 01:07:06.06 A lot of histories not written like that.
01:07:06.06 --> 01:07:07.58 Section here called the worst and the best.
01:07:07.58 --> 01:07:12.78 So now what he does is he starts pointing out some, and this is why I can start moving a
01:07:12.78 --> 01:07:13.78 little bit faster.
01:07:13.78 --> 01:07:16.66 I told you before we started recording like, hey, there's a big chunk of the book we're
01:07:16.66 --> 01:07:21.66 going to cover and cover and what podcast because he starts going into a lot of details
01:07:21.66 --> 01:07:23.02 and it's worth reading.
01:07:23.02 --> 01:07:25.58 You have to get the book if you want to read all these things.
01:07:25.58 --> 01:07:31.90 But he starts pointing out the worst and the best of some of these military leaders.
01:07:31.90 --> 01:07:36.06 He said this about Hitler or John Strauss and said this about Hitler in a war from which
01:07:36.06 --> 01:07:40.86 so much human error had been eliminated by technological advances alone.
01:07:40.86 --> 01:07:45.30 Human error was still the principal factor in determining wars outcome.
01:07:45.30 --> 01:07:48.62 Hitler, slip knot.
01:07:48.62 --> 01:07:49.62 A little bit about Hitler.
01:07:49.62 --> 01:07:53.74 Hitler's particular brand of military incompetence is precisely what one would expect.
01:07:53.74 --> 01:07:58.02 He showed a total unconcern for the physical and psychological welfare of his men and
01:07:58.02 --> 01:07:59.02 his armies.
01:07:59.02 --> 01:08:02.16 And we, man, when we covered Stalin Grot, remember when we covered Stalin Grot on this
01:08:02.16 --> 01:08:03.16 podcast?
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:05.46 Actually, a book called Stalin Grot.
01:08:05.46 --> 01:08:14.58 He was written by a Nazi soldier and they were listening on the radio as they were surrounded
01:08:14.58 --> 01:08:23.78 and they were listening to Hitler talk about praising their dying to the last man.
01:08:23.78 --> 01:08:28.34 That's like insane.
01:08:28.34 --> 01:08:32.58 Number two, his imperviousness to human suffering, which resulted in such enormous waste
01:08:32.58 --> 01:08:37.38 of his own forces was a contributary factor in his stubborn refusal to ever relinquish
01:08:37.38 --> 01:08:39.26 gained ground.
01:08:39.26 --> 01:08:45.02 Three from his extreme ethnocentrism came another well-known form of military incompetence
01:08:45.02 --> 01:08:50.18 that which results from a gross underestimation of the enemy and in particular of the ability
01:08:50.18 --> 01:08:53.26 of civilian populations to withstand the effect of war.
01:08:53.26 --> 01:08:54.26 Yep.
01:08:54.26 --> 01:09:00.26 Thinking that your Nazi soldiers are just superior and then you come up against the Russians
01:09:00.26 --> 01:09:03.34 civilians and they're like, what?
01:09:03.34 --> 01:09:05.54 One play?
01:09:05.54 --> 01:09:08.22 And thinking that they're just going to fold.
01:09:08.22 --> 01:09:11.70 Thinking that the Russians are just the Russians civilian populace and even their
01:09:11.70 --> 01:09:17.38 red army, which is, you know, bait up of, you know, peasant soldiers, they're going to
01:09:17.38 --> 01:09:21.98 fold under the might of the Nazis.
01:09:21.98 --> 01:09:25.30 You might want to check yourself, homey.
01:09:25.30 --> 01:09:29.90 While many of foreign, while many of Hitler's decisions were military disastrous, his underlying
01:09:29.90 --> 01:09:34.90 ego weakness and fear of criticism eventually in several other traits which are under
01:09:34.90 --> 01:09:38.14 desirable to say the least in a military senior commander.
01:09:38.14 --> 01:09:44.86 He promoted his AIDS and advisors for their sick of the C rather than their ability.
01:09:44.86 --> 01:09:47.02 Just promote people because they sucked up to him.
01:09:47.02 --> 01:09:50.78 He refused to accept, believe, or even listen to unpalatable intelligence and when things
01:09:50.78 --> 01:09:56.10 got went really wrong, he was first to find scapegoats, opposite of extreme ownership,
01:09:56.10 --> 01:09:58.70 promoting people because they kissed your ass.
01:09:58.70 --> 01:10:01.46 Not listening to intelligence coming in.
01:10:01.46 --> 01:10:05.34 This is having closed mind being an idiot.
01:10:05.34 --> 01:10:10.94 Like his henchmen, himler, even Hitler, could on occasion show that over control of aggression,
01:10:10.94 --> 01:10:16.46 that procrastination, which has incapacitated some other authoritarian military commanders,
01:10:16.46 --> 01:10:20.18 perhaps his most disastrous decision of the war was when he halted the German advance
01:10:20.18 --> 01:10:24.78 before Dunkirk, thus allowing the British to escape.
01:10:24.78 --> 01:10:30.74 Finally on April 22nd, 1945, Hitler failed as a military commander in a way that he had never
01:10:30.74 --> 01:10:34.82 failed before, and advocating responsibility he betrayed his command.
01:10:34.82 --> 01:10:38.26 And if you're a Ben and leadership in duty like so, yeah, he quit.
01:10:38.26 --> 01:11:02.66 He's the ultimate quitter, D.O.R.D.O.R.D.D.D., drop on request on April 22nd, 1945, and then a few days later, on April 30th, killed himself.
01:11:02.66 --> 01:11:12.46 He was a good person dumb.
01:11:12.46 --> 01:11:15.30 All those things, not stupid.
01:11:15.30 --> 01:11:20.18 So you can be really smart and do really dumb things because you're authoritarian, because
01:11:20.18 --> 01:11:22.98 your ego is out of control, etc.
01:11:22.98 --> 01:11:26.78 Some good examples.
01:11:26.78 --> 01:11:29.70 General Sir James Wolff.
01:11:29.70 --> 01:11:33.70 He's bitterly and unfashionally opposed to what he called the spirit-breaking tactics of
01:11:33.70 --> 01:11:35.82 harsh punishment and drill.
01:11:35.82 --> 01:11:39.82 Was quite prepared to disobey orders if these conflicted with what he knew was right.
01:11:39.82 --> 01:11:43.70 That sees us going through like these are the opposite of authoritarian personalities.
01:11:43.70 --> 01:11:47.10 This guy's Sir James Wolff, I'm going to burn through some of these at the risk of making himself
01:11:47.10 --> 01:11:48.10 on popular.
01:11:48.10 --> 01:11:53.94 He forced his officers to attend the welfare of their men to visit their living quarters,
01:11:53.94 --> 01:11:59.74 have regard for their health and generally get to know them as fellow human beings.
01:11:59.74 --> 01:12:00.74 Wellington.
01:12:00.74 --> 01:12:02.34 Next guy, he highlights here.
01:12:02.34 --> 01:12:06.98 Wellington did not even science of emotional restriction, did not remain unmoved by human
01:12:06.98 --> 01:12:07.98 suffering.
01:12:07.98 --> 01:12:13.66 Suffering did not seek popularity was unimpressed by bull and did not seek scapegoats for
01:12:13.66 --> 01:12:15.06 his military setbacks.
01:12:15.06 --> 01:12:17.70 This is a good leader.
01:12:17.70 --> 01:12:20.22 He spurned the decorations of authority.
01:12:20.22 --> 01:12:23.90 Large staffs, centuries, gold braids.
01:12:23.90 --> 01:12:26.30 We didn't want to be all dressed up.
01:12:26.30 --> 01:12:32.70 Wellington's self-confidence is also reflected in his refusal to make scapegoats of others.
01:12:32.70 --> 01:12:37.86 Thus up the Burgos fiasco he said, I see that a disposition already exists to blame the
01:12:37.86 --> 01:12:41.18 government for the failure of the siege of Burgos.
01:12:41.18 --> 01:12:45.98 It was entirely my own act.
01:12:45.98 --> 01:12:48.46 Thankfully he didn't put that into a book and call it extreme ownership.
01:12:48.46 --> 01:12:50.58 Otherwise I would have been kind of out of luck.
01:12:50.58 --> 01:12:52.78 Because that's what he did.
01:12:52.78 --> 01:12:57.94 Here's the bad situation that unfolded during the siege and he took ownership of it.
01:12:57.94 --> 01:13:01.10 Then blame anybody.
01:13:01.10 --> 01:13:06.26 As usual after a battle his mood was set by the losses, not the glory.
01:13:06.26 --> 01:13:12.34 On the morning after the siege, another Wellington showed himself to his deeply astonished
01:13:12.34 --> 01:13:13.34 staff.
01:13:13.34 --> 01:13:17.98 He visited the dead and on seeing so many of his finest men destroyed, he broke down and
01:13:17.98 --> 01:13:22.98 swept.
01:13:22.98 --> 01:13:30.14 Finally he displayed an open mind to new ideas, quick to innovate and see advantages in the
01:13:30.14 --> 01:13:31.86 progress of technology.
01:13:31.86 --> 01:13:38.30 Use remarkably laws a fair regarding the dress of his soldiers.
01:13:38.30 --> 01:13:42.06 Thirdly he did not commit that cardinal error of so many military incompetence under
01:13:42.06 --> 01:13:48.42 the rest of the enemy, he took infinite plans, pains and military planning, left nothing
01:13:48.42 --> 01:13:52.06 to chance, selected officers for their efficiency, always did recon.
01:13:52.06 --> 01:13:53.86 So you can see what he's getting out here.
01:13:53.86 --> 01:14:01.50 Shaka, the Zulu King of his general ship that has been written.
01:14:01.50 --> 01:14:07.02 Shaka's particular genius, laying his meticulous personal attention to detail and sheer
01:14:07.02 --> 01:14:08.34 hard work.
01:14:08.34 --> 01:14:12.82 If it all possible, he always insisted on inspecting everything himself in every one of
01:14:12.82 --> 01:14:17.74 his critical battles he insisted on personal recon ordering the ground and the disposition
01:14:17.74 --> 01:14:23.62 of enemy forces, he invariably checked all reports by procuring collateral evidence.
01:14:23.62 --> 01:14:25.46 Shaka could also be humane.
01:14:25.46 --> 01:14:31.90 He talks about Shaka actually being pretty brutal to his men, which I don't always
01:14:31.90 --> 01:14:36.66 a little bit thinking, well, why are you trying to give this guy as this great example?
01:14:36.66 --> 01:14:40.02 Who's who hesitated to follow his example in painful initiation where instantly clubbed
01:14:40.02 --> 01:14:41.02 the death?
01:14:41.02 --> 01:14:43.46 It seems a little authoritarian to me, bro.
01:14:43.46 --> 01:14:44.46 Dixon, where are you at?
01:14:44.46 --> 01:14:49.90 Well, I mean, if we're cutting some slack here, so here's the deal.
01:14:49.90 --> 01:14:54.10 Another example of his flexibility and refusal to dominate a by tradition was Shaka's
01:14:54.10 --> 01:14:56.34 banning of sandals for his fighting men.
01:14:56.34 --> 01:14:59.98 By making them run barefoot, a considerable and by no means popular break with tradition,
01:14:59.98 --> 01:15:04.22 he invested his army, the speed of movement, foreign access of that achievement by his enemies.
01:15:04.22 --> 01:15:09.66 The displeasure he incurred through this innovation was hardly reduced by an order to his
01:15:09.66 --> 01:15:14.46 warriors that they should harden their feet on the parade ground, stroom with thorns.
01:15:14.46 --> 01:15:18.30 Those who hesitated to follow him in his example in this painful tradition were instantly
01:15:18.30 --> 01:15:19.74 clubbed the death.
01:15:19.74 --> 01:15:23.42 Seems a little authoritarian there, bro.
01:15:23.42 --> 01:15:30.62 But Dixon says that Shaka could also be humane as well as punitive in caring for his
01:15:30.62 --> 01:15:34.46 army to ensure that his fighting men were kept warm, well rested and well fed and orderly
01:15:34.46 --> 01:15:37.22 was provided for every three soldiers under his command.
01:15:37.22 --> 01:15:42.34 No battles fought without adequate supplies of food, water, and bark dressings being assembled
01:15:42.34 --> 01:15:44.46 at strategic points beforehand.
01:15:44.46 --> 01:15:49.62 It can be summed up as autocratic, totally non-authoritarian, high-enachievement motivation
01:15:49.62 --> 01:15:52.66 and yet capable of great warmth and sympathy.
01:15:52.66 --> 01:15:57.98 According to Ritter, he was highly emotional and sentimental behind a facade of iron-clad
01:15:57.98 --> 01:16:01.94 iron self-discipline the fact that he was the finest composer of songs.
01:16:01.94 --> 01:16:07.10 The leading dancer and wittyest punster suggests an artist who would naturally have a highly
01:16:07.10 --> 01:16:14.78 strong nature and more sensitive than the comber common run of the Nungi race.
01:16:14.78 --> 01:16:18.82 So there's Shaka Napoleon.
01:16:18.82 --> 01:16:22.62 The evidence suggests that though he was ambitious ruthless, devious unscrupulous, grand
01:16:22.62 --> 01:16:29.14 geos, despotic, Machiavellian, dictatorial and autocratic he was not authoritarian.
01:16:29.14 --> 01:16:35.98 Again, this is where he's getting some semantics here that's kind of like, mmmm.
01:16:35.98 --> 01:16:40.74 Napoleon could be the reverse of extra punitive, the fault to argue lay not so much
01:16:40.74 --> 01:16:43.02 of the men as with himself.
01:16:43.02 --> 01:16:48.14 So he, when things were didn't go the way he wanted, he often said it was his fault.
01:16:48.14 --> 01:16:50.58 Cool.
01:16:50.58 --> 01:16:55.02 I think he's stretching, man, on Napoleon.
01:16:55.02 --> 01:16:57.10 Because I think it's a scale, right?
01:16:57.10 --> 01:17:00.42 Napoleon, I think, had an open mind when it came to combat.
01:17:00.42 --> 01:17:02.02 But I think he was an ego maniac.
01:17:02.02 --> 01:17:03.26 We have a free what's that?
01:17:03.26 --> 01:17:05.26 Napoleon complex, right?
01:17:05.26 --> 01:17:09.70 You're all little and trying to be big.
01:17:09.70 --> 01:17:14.30 Stern and Imperius II, in his business hours, Napoleon was all ease and sunshine to his
01:17:14.30 --> 01:17:15.30 sentiments.
01:17:15.30 --> 01:17:18.94 They admired his pleasant wit, his unaffected gate, he's rich and brilliant, handing of
01:17:18.94 --> 01:17:20.54 moral and political themes.
01:17:20.54 --> 01:17:25.22 And he's trying to make him out to be a little less authoritarian than he was in my opinion.
01:17:25.22 --> 01:17:32.74 But some of these guy, even the guy Chuck Azulu, he was maybe he was authoritarian in certain
01:17:32.74 --> 01:17:33.74 ways.
01:17:33.74 --> 01:17:35.34 That's what I just said, it's a scale, right?
01:17:35.34 --> 01:17:36.34 Or whatever in other ways.
01:17:36.34 --> 01:17:38.30 And he kind of found Chuck a balance.
01:17:38.30 --> 01:17:44.98 Yeah, so like back to Chuck, he would be not what is the one, what's the opposite of
01:17:44.98 --> 01:17:47.42 authoritarian, authoritarian?
01:17:47.42 --> 01:17:48.42 Libre, what's the opposite?
01:17:48.42 --> 01:17:51.54 Well, yeah, he was anti.
01:17:51.54 --> 01:17:54.74 Except when it came to those feet, man, those feet got it, you know, like, you got a
01:17:54.74 --> 01:17:57.66 like, how you guys say, you got the line on some stuff.
01:17:57.66 --> 01:18:00.50 You know, those radios, you got to know how to program your radios.
01:18:00.50 --> 01:18:03.06 But the patches, that's like a little bit.
01:18:03.06 --> 01:18:05.06 So Chuck was like that with a lot of stuff.
01:18:05.06 --> 01:18:06.86 So man, Chuck, kind of keeping it real.
01:18:06.86 --> 01:18:07.86 Kind of keeping it real.
01:18:07.86 --> 01:18:09.70 Kind of keeping it real, you know.
01:18:09.70 --> 01:18:10.70 But that's how, right?
01:18:10.70 --> 01:18:11.70 That's the day caught him.
01:18:11.70 --> 01:18:12.70 Yeah.
01:18:12.70 --> 01:18:13.70 That's the day caught him in.
01:18:13.70 --> 01:18:15.90 And I think that's, he's trying to point out some of that day caught him.
01:18:15.90 --> 01:18:18.38 I think he's leaning to try and show these good leaders as being less of them.
01:18:18.38 --> 01:18:19.38 authoritarian.
01:18:19.38 --> 01:18:20.38 Yeah.
01:18:20.38 --> 01:18:27.22 Because Napoleon, I mean, gusher, you know, Hitler, Napoleon, these guys like, yeah, they
01:18:27.22 --> 01:18:30.14 lost and they lost huge and they're bad.
01:18:30.14 --> 01:18:31.94 But they did some effective stuff.
01:18:31.94 --> 01:18:36.62 Oh, yeah, well, Napoleon, I mean, Napoleon won a lot.
01:18:36.62 --> 01:18:38.02 And Hitler won a lot too, man.
01:18:38.02 --> 01:18:39.02 That's what I'm saying.
01:18:39.02 --> 01:18:40.78 So let's crack kick in and off.
01:18:40.78 --> 01:18:46.34 Took over giant swaths of Europe and Napoleon did the same thing.
01:18:46.34 --> 01:18:50.98 So there was definitely some, they did some shit that was that they want.
01:18:50.98 --> 01:18:51.98 It was effective.
01:18:51.98 --> 01:18:52.98 Yeah.
01:18:52.98 --> 01:18:56.58 And by the way, there's other people that were totally authoritarian that did authoritarian
01:18:56.58 --> 01:19:01.78 shit and law and also want the Crimean War, right?
01:19:01.78 --> 01:19:07.06 With the brits, the brits were doing the dumbest, most horrible authoritarian ego driven
01:19:07.06 --> 01:19:16.22 moves and getting guys killed by the bushel and yet they still were able to win.
01:19:16.22 --> 01:19:19.54 This is a little bit more about Napoleon, finally like many of the other commanders on our
01:19:19.54 --> 01:19:20.54 list.
01:19:20.54 --> 01:19:22.30 Napoleon was without that vanity.
01:19:22.30 --> 01:19:26.94 This like struck me bro, without that vanity which Patokan's a week ego was notoriously
01:19:26.94 --> 01:19:30.86 careless about his dress, had a wide range of intellectual interests and promoted his
01:19:30.86 --> 01:19:32.54 subordinates on the basis of their efficiency.
01:19:32.54 --> 01:19:33.54 Okay.
01:19:33.54 --> 01:19:34.54 So that's cool.
01:19:34.54 --> 01:19:35.54 Makes sense.
01:19:35.54 --> 01:19:39.02 Nor did he display the debilitating over control of aggression, which his on occasion
01:19:39.02 --> 01:19:44.86 is paralyzed, warlike behavior of less successful commanders.
01:19:44.86 --> 01:19:45.86 Nelson.
01:19:45.86 --> 01:19:53.74 Nelson did not display a compulsive concern with Ordea Lenniss if his dress was anxious to
01:19:53.74 --> 01:19:58.58 give pleasure to everyone about him distinguishing each turn by some act of kindness and chiefly
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:00.34 those who seem to require it.
01:20:00.34 --> 01:20:04.02 The most Nelson seems like he's just a really good guy.
01:20:04.02 --> 01:20:07.46 And he residual doubts one might have regarding Nelson's freedom from the crippling effects
01:20:07.46 --> 01:20:13.50 of a week ego should be resolved by considering his most famous characteristic disobedience.
01:20:13.50 --> 01:20:15.42 Possessing boundless moral courage.
01:20:15.42 --> 01:20:21.06 He was himself prepared to disobey if he fought it to the advantage of his country.
01:20:21.06 --> 01:20:22.38 And often he was right.
01:20:22.38 --> 01:20:26.94 Nelson was in fact always urging others even allies, superiors and officials of the army
01:20:26.94 --> 01:20:32.78 to disregard their orders if necessary and what he thought was to be the general interest
01:20:32.78 --> 01:20:34.94 of the cause.
01:20:34.94 --> 01:20:42.90 This is one of the best quotes on decentralized command I have ever heard in my life.
01:20:42.90 --> 01:20:45.34 So this is Nelson.
01:20:45.34 --> 01:20:52.06 Nelson's own view of this matter was uncomplicated as he said to the Duke of Clarence
01:20:52.06 --> 01:21:00.18 to serve my king and to destroy the French I consider as the great order of all from which
01:21:00.18 --> 01:21:03.02 little one spring.
01:21:03.02 --> 01:21:10.54 And if one of these little ones militate against it for who can exactly tell at a distance
01:21:10.54 --> 01:21:15.78 I go back and obey the great order and object.
01:21:15.78 --> 01:21:19.18 That's a beautiful understanding of decentralized command.
01:21:19.18 --> 01:21:20.78 Here's what we're trying to get done.
01:21:20.78 --> 01:21:22.30 And there's a bunch of different ways you can get it done.
01:21:22.30 --> 01:21:25.86 I'm telling you to do something but it doesn't quite make sense in supporting the strategic
01:21:25.86 --> 01:21:26.86 goal.
01:21:26.86 --> 01:21:27.86 Don't do it.
01:21:27.86 --> 01:21:29.82 Do something else.
01:21:29.82 --> 01:21:36.38 So that's a non-authoritarian mindset which is good to go.
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:41.34 See Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia of his general ship, L'Adele Hart Row Lawrence can bear
01:21:41.34 --> 01:21:46.98 comparison with Mar-Bron Napoleon in that vital faculty of general ship.
01:21:46.98 --> 01:21:51.14 The power of grasping instantly the picture of the ground in situation of relating the
01:21:51.14 --> 01:21:53.98 one to the other and the local to the general.
01:21:53.98 --> 01:21:57.90 He was able to see what was happening not just what's happening right there but see it in
01:21:57.90 --> 01:21:58.90 the big picture.
01:21:58.90 --> 01:22:01.70 He was able to attach take a step back, look around.
01:22:01.70 --> 01:22:06.26 I think strategic L'Adele Hart considered that Lawrence also showed the same profound
01:22:06.26 --> 01:22:11.54 profound understanding of human nature, the same power of commanding affection while
01:22:11.54 --> 01:22:16.70 commanding energy and the same consummate blend of diplomacy with strategy.
01:22:16.70 --> 01:22:23.34 At a cool head, L'Adele Hart also considered that Lawrence the most widely read of generals
01:22:23.34 --> 01:22:29.66 was more of a steep denogged of war than any other generals of the last one.
01:22:29.66 --> 01:22:34.42 In personality, this one read a little bit more because well because this in personality
01:22:34.42 --> 01:22:39.66 Lawrence is probably the least authoritarian senior commander of the world as ever known.
01:22:39.66 --> 01:22:46.18 He was totally without personal ambition, refused promotion, honors and awards for himself
01:22:46.18 --> 01:22:52.42 and deplored the pump, vanities and ritualized bowing and scraping which won associate with
01:22:52.42 --> 01:22:57.54 the power structure of the hierarchical command systems.
01:22:57.54 --> 01:22:58.54 We like this guy.
01:22:58.54 --> 01:22:59.54 How do they get?
01:22:59.54 --> 01:23:02.54 Yeah, we're down.
01:23:02.54 --> 01:23:07.06 The fact that he could renounce his name for that of Ross and later Sean happily
01:23:07.06 --> 01:23:13.62 resume his role of a lowly ranker after achieving worldwide fame indicates a degree of
01:23:13.62 --> 01:23:18.38 self-effacement quite unique amongst military men.
01:23:18.38 --> 01:23:24.42 Contrary to a characteristic predisposition of authoritarian individuals, Lawrence disliked
01:23:24.42 --> 01:23:29.26 interfering with other men's freedom.
01:23:29.26 --> 01:23:32.10 You can't impose on other people you shouldn't impose on other people you shouldn't
01:23:32.10 --> 01:23:34.54 mess with their freedom.
01:23:34.54 --> 01:23:41.78 He disliked giving orders and in fact exercised effective command largely through the
01:23:41.78 --> 01:23:44.66 tendering of advice.
01:23:44.66 --> 01:23:48.62 Have you ever heard of your late father and explained how many times I gave him a direct
01:23:48.62 --> 01:23:49.62 order?
01:23:49.62 --> 01:23:56.62 Oh yes, I have heard him explain the number.
01:23:56.62 --> 01:23:58.10 Zero times.
01:23:58.10 --> 01:24:02.10 That this advice was acted upon suggest that by his personality he achieved a level of
01:24:02.10 --> 01:24:06.10 leadership rarely attained by military commanders.
01:24:06.10 --> 01:24:10.86 He himself was prepared to obey foolish orders but disliked passing these on to others
01:24:10.86 --> 01:24:16.34 as La Dal Hart remarks and war such orders are often the result useless sacrifice of men's
01:24:16.34 --> 01:24:20.58 lives in peace they often contribute to the sterilization of men's reason.
01:24:20.58 --> 01:24:22.42 Oh that's a good one.
01:24:22.42 --> 01:24:27.86 You barco orders, you make people do what you want them to do, you're going to sterilize
01:24:27.86 --> 01:24:31.10 their brain.
01:24:31.10 --> 01:24:35.90 Lawrence was a great respect to reason and consider that the possession of knowledge was
01:24:35.90 --> 01:24:38.42 of primary importance for a military leader.
01:24:38.42 --> 01:24:43.06 In his opinion, quote, the perfect general would know everything in heaven and earth and
01:24:43.06 --> 01:24:50.06 quote by the same token this most open minded of men deported the closed and vaccus minds
01:24:50.06 --> 01:24:57.50 of his military compatriots of men who displayed a quote fundamental crippling, incuriousness.
01:24:57.50 --> 01:25:00.30 There you go.
01:25:00.30 --> 01:25:03.30 T.E. Lawrence.
01:25:03.30 --> 01:25:07.98 We got slim who this thing kicked off with, general slim like so many generals when plans
01:25:07.98 --> 01:25:08.98 have gone wrong.
01:25:08.98 --> 01:25:11.30 Oh, you take a little bit of ownership here.
01:25:11.30 --> 01:25:15.70 Like so many generals, as a quote, when so many generals like so many generals when plans
01:25:15.70 --> 01:25:18.94 have gone wrong, I could find plenty of excuses.
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:22.10 But only one reason myself.
01:25:22.10 --> 01:25:27.70 When two courses of action were open to me, I had not chosen as a good commander should
01:25:27.70 --> 01:25:28.90 the boulder.
01:25:28.90 --> 01:25:33.18 I had taken counsel of my fears and bad reference.
01:25:33.18 --> 01:25:39.06 There is no evidence here of that telltale defense projection and even though he had ample
01:25:39.06 --> 01:25:43.34 opportunity for making scapegoats to those subordinates who had given the advice which
01:25:43.34 --> 01:25:44.34 tended to failure.
01:25:44.34 --> 01:25:46.02 So you got another guy slim.
01:25:46.02 --> 01:25:52.62 Had he written a book and taken, you know, given it a cool title like extreme ownership.
01:25:52.62 --> 01:25:56.50 We mean a different spot right now.
01:25:56.50 --> 01:26:00.34 Taken into account with other traits as warmth towards his family is absence of rigidity
01:26:00.34 --> 01:26:04.54 as parsimony with the lives of his men, his ability to improvise his popularity with
01:26:04.54 --> 01:26:08.90 the troops and relative lack of concern regarding his popularity with his equals.
01:26:08.90 --> 01:26:12.38 She had come as no surprise to learn that this shiverless, autocratic and most efficient
01:26:12.38 --> 01:26:17.10 of generals enjoyed a happy childhood apparently unmarked by those stresses and strange
01:26:17.10 --> 01:26:20.18 which may weaken the ego and stunt the personality.
01:26:20.18 --> 01:26:23.22 He kind of, in I've been skipping these parts a little bit.
01:26:23.22 --> 01:26:26.90 I'm guessing being a little bit biased, but I'm skipping a lot of the clothes like go
01:26:26.90 --> 01:26:31.46 and analysis because you know that and I'm just giving you that little taste of them.
01:26:31.46 --> 01:26:32.78 You want to get some of that.
01:26:32.78 --> 01:26:36.30 You got to kind of get into it here a little bit.
01:26:36.30 --> 01:26:39.78 His next section is exceptions to the rule.
01:26:39.78 --> 01:26:41.82 Got a little quote here from Rommel.
01:26:41.82 --> 01:26:46.54 One must not judge everyone in the world by his qualities as a soldier otherwise we should
01:26:46.54 --> 01:26:50.22 have no civilization that's Rommel to his son.
01:26:50.22 --> 01:26:52.38 Interesting.
01:26:52.38 --> 01:26:58.02 In confidence is not confined to those who were extreme in their ineptitude but may operate
01:26:58.02 --> 01:27:06.74 a long line of a continuum of military excellence from worst to the best senior commanders.
01:27:06.74 --> 01:27:12.94 Military shortcomings of Montgomery, Kitchener and Hague and their positions along a dimension
01:27:12.94 --> 01:27:16.18 of authoritarianism are perfectly correlated.
01:27:16.18 --> 01:27:19.54 So this is what you were saying earlier.
01:27:19.54 --> 01:27:24.78 It's not like, oh, this is either a authoritarian or you're not.
01:27:24.78 --> 01:27:26.26 You could be anywhere on this spectrum.
01:27:26.26 --> 01:27:30.86 And as we have been discussing, you want to have some level of authoritarianism.
01:27:30.86 --> 01:27:31.86 You just don't want too much.
01:27:31.86 --> 01:27:32.86 It's got to be a balance.
01:27:32.86 --> 01:27:36.42 But some people can be, oh, they're a little bit in the red.
01:27:36.42 --> 01:27:38.18 Some people full green.
01:27:38.18 --> 01:27:39.66 Maybe some people too much green.
01:27:39.66 --> 01:27:40.82 They're going to make it.
01:27:40.82 --> 01:27:44.78 But I think in the military, people that are far green don't even join the military.
01:27:44.78 --> 01:27:47.02 We got to remember that people might even in there.
01:27:47.02 --> 01:27:51.66 So you already have a composite of people that are a little bit at least in the middle.
01:27:51.66 --> 01:27:52.86 Maybe a little bit orange.
01:27:52.86 --> 01:27:55.02 Some people lean in in the red.
01:27:55.02 --> 01:27:58.30 And it's a continuum.
01:27:58.30 --> 01:28:02.54 Talking about Montgomery, and again, you got to get, if you want the details of this,
01:28:02.54 --> 01:28:03.54 read, get the book.
01:28:03.54 --> 01:28:07.98 It's not my purpose to debate Montgomery's greatness of face to say that, while not without
01:28:07.98 --> 01:28:13.06 blemishes, he was in the main, a highly competent commander, and as such needs to be considered
01:28:13.06 --> 01:28:17.90 in present context, does he or does he not support the hypothesis that competence depends
01:28:17.90 --> 01:28:22.38 upon an absence of authoritarianism and its associated traits.
01:28:22.38 --> 01:28:24.86 So that's what we're really hearing there is that.
01:28:24.86 --> 01:28:27.94 The more authoritarian you are, the worse you're going to be.
01:28:27.94 --> 01:28:31.66 Unless you have zero authoritarianism.
01:28:31.66 --> 01:28:35.42 And he points out some things that makes him not authoritarianism.
01:28:35.42 --> 01:28:36.42 Authoritarianistic.
01:28:36.42 --> 01:28:40.26 Here's Montgomery lacked those obsessive traits, which tend to accompany authoritarianism.
01:28:40.26 --> 01:28:44.70 He's not particularly mean or particularly obstinate and judging from his own dress and
01:28:44.70 --> 01:28:46.58 leaning it attitude towards that of his troops.
01:28:46.58 --> 01:28:49.74 He did not harbor any compulsive urge for a bull.
01:28:49.74 --> 01:28:54.66 In this, as in other matters, his approach was essentially realistic.
01:28:54.66 --> 01:29:00.02 Seems that whatever else he may be, Montgomery does not advance a well-documented signs
01:29:00.02 --> 01:29:01.74 of authoritarianism.
01:29:01.74 --> 01:29:05.38 And yet, even in this case, there remains the undisputable fact that for all his greatness
01:29:05.38 --> 01:29:10.86 as a military commander, Montgomery did have serious shortcomings which could not be attributed
01:29:10.86 --> 01:29:13.46 to a lack of professional ability.
01:29:13.46 --> 01:29:17.26 So Montgomery did some jack-up things, and we covered it in one of the earlier podcasts.
01:29:17.26 --> 01:29:23.14 We also covered it on a podcast, not about this book.
01:29:23.14 --> 01:29:29.02 These lapses were an inability to get along with many of his military colleagues.
01:29:29.02 --> 01:29:33.42 Like Kitchener, he had a knack of making himself enormously unpopular with his contemporaries
01:29:33.42 --> 01:29:35.90 and preferred the company of younger and more junior officers.
01:29:35.90 --> 01:29:39.18 It was a bad sign of talking about this on the Academy of the other day.
01:29:39.18 --> 01:29:41.38 Extremeownership.com.
01:29:41.38 --> 01:29:43.26 Somebody who's talking about it can't get along.
01:29:43.26 --> 01:29:45.58 If you're not getting along with people, you're doing a bad job.
01:29:45.58 --> 01:29:47.22 But what's wrong with you?
01:29:47.22 --> 01:29:49.26 Aren't you getting along with people?
01:29:49.26 --> 01:29:50.86 You should be getting along with people.
01:29:50.86 --> 01:29:51.86 It was part of your job.
01:29:51.86 --> 01:29:52.86 Build relationships.
01:29:52.86 --> 01:29:55.14 What's happening with you?
01:29:55.14 --> 01:30:00.10 Montgomery's second shortcoming was that he sometimes allowed his own desire for personal
01:30:00.10 --> 01:30:04.46 glory to influence planning, a military plan tainted by an attempt to satisfy the commander's
01:30:04.46 --> 01:30:09.02 ego is unlikely to be the best plan, and irrelevant factor has been introduced into the
01:30:09.02 --> 01:30:10.02 calculation.
01:30:10.02 --> 01:30:12.18 Clearly, that's jacked up.
01:30:12.18 --> 01:30:15.58 Montgomery's next shortcoming presents something of a paradox, a concerns, a matter
01:30:15.58 --> 01:30:16.58 of communication.
01:30:16.58 --> 01:30:21.82 From man who is a depth that simplifying the apparently complex, whose ability to extract
01:30:21.82 --> 01:30:27.46 the essentials from a host of irrelevant factors was second to none, who could communicate
01:30:27.46 --> 01:30:31.46 his intentions and issue orders to his subordinates with the lucidity that left no room for
01:30:31.46 --> 01:30:36.30 misinterpretation, and who could write his memoirs with such a style that puts most generals
01:30:36.30 --> 01:30:37.30 to shame.
01:30:37.30 --> 01:30:41.98 It is extraordinary that he should have been almost incapable of explaining himself to those
01:30:41.98 --> 01:30:42.78 above him in the J.D.
01:30:42.78 --> 01:30:43.78 Command.
01:30:43.78 --> 01:30:44.78 Kind of crazy.
01:30:44.78 --> 01:30:50.42 Got a whole big explanation on Montgomery and who wears some of that stuff came from
01:30:50.42 --> 01:30:53.38 fast forward a little bit to Kitchener Kitchener who became Secretary of State in the
01:30:53.38 --> 01:30:59.30 First World War had, according to Philip Magnus, two basic attributes and unparalleled
01:30:59.30 --> 01:31:02.22 thoroughness and an unparalleled drive.
01:31:02.22 --> 01:31:06.98 He was an individual, individualist of great conceptions, whose hard and selfless nature
01:31:06.98 --> 01:31:10.54 was capable at times of kindness, sympathy, and even affection.
01:31:10.54 --> 01:31:16.26 His traits, his excessive drive, Lord Curson, once described Kitchener as this molten
01:31:16.26 --> 01:31:21.94 massive devouring energy, his individualism, and his refusal to conform the originality
01:31:21.94 --> 01:31:26.34 of his thinking and the occasional flashes of underlying warmth and generosity are hard
01:31:26.34 --> 01:31:29.18 to reconcile with the notion of authoritarianism.
01:31:29.18 --> 01:31:36.34 So he's got Montgomery who has some authoritarianism, Kitchener is a little bit more authoritarianism
01:31:36.34 --> 01:31:41.94 and as we push through his authoritarianism from Kitchener for all his greatness, Kitchener
01:31:41.94 --> 01:31:46.54 seems to have been a victim of the repressive forces in place in him as a child, presumably
01:31:46.54 --> 01:31:48.10 as a marionette of his father.
01:31:48.10 --> 01:31:53.98 Then psychoanalytics going on, but what were those traits, regardless of where they came from,
01:31:53.98 --> 01:31:58.18 his elufness, his unpopularism, many of his fellow officers, his failure to work as part
01:31:58.18 --> 01:31:59.18 of a team.
01:31:59.18 --> 01:32:03.74 And most damaging of all is latter-day indecisiveness and hesitancy in directing, collipally,
01:32:03.74 --> 01:32:07.90 and pain must be ascribed to defects of the personality rather than intellect.
01:32:07.90 --> 01:32:12.92 And again, it's just interesting to point out that authoritarianism, you'd think that
01:32:12.92 --> 01:32:18.22 makes people make calls, but it actually freaks them out in these pressures that you
01:32:18.22 --> 01:32:22.44 waste because they don't want to get, they don't, they don't, they don't handle failure
01:32:22.44 --> 01:32:25.18 that don't know what to do and they just, they don't want to do anything.
01:32:25.18 --> 01:32:27.98 Run to, run to, run, go off!
01:32:27.98 --> 01:32:29.46 Where's somebody that's a little less authoritarian?
01:32:29.46 --> 01:32:31.50 So like, okay, you know what, we've got to make a call here.
01:32:31.50 --> 01:32:32.50 That's what we're doing.
01:32:32.50 --> 01:32:39.26 Now, we get to Hague, and trying to answer the question whether the recurring features
01:32:39.26 --> 01:32:43.18 of military incompetence derived from aspects of the authoritarian personality even in
01:32:43.18 --> 01:32:45.74 a commander who ultimately emerged victorious.
01:32:45.74 --> 01:32:49.46 One cannot do better than consider the case of Douglas Hague, Commander-in-Chief of the
01:32:49.46 --> 01:32:54.42 British armies on the Western Front between 1915 and 1918.
01:32:54.42 --> 01:32:58.70 Dudging from the war of words, which has raged between his detractors and devotees, there
01:32:58.70 --> 01:33:00.90 was never a more controversial military commander.
01:33:00.90 --> 01:33:07.34 Here's some quotes, Hague, Britain's number one war criminal, expected Germans to advance
01:33:07.34 --> 01:33:12.78 in this attack and at the same time slow, at the same slow pace of his own clumsily planned
01:33:12.78 --> 01:33:13.78 results.
01:33:13.78 --> 01:33:17.46 Another quote, he seemed to be most highly equipped thinker in the British army.
01:33:17.46 --> 01:33:19.66 That's totally different quote.
01:33:19.66 --> 01:33:23.90 Another quote, Hague perhaps failed to see that a dead man cannot advance and that to
01:33:23.90 --> 01:33:26.22 replace him is only to provide another corpse.
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:30.94 Here's another quote, it is indeed strange that the man who stubbornness in the offensive
01:33:30.94 --> 01:33:37.22 had all but ruined us on the Psalm should from August 1918 onwards have become the driving
01:33:37.22 --> 01:33:39.22 force of the Allied armies.
01:33:39.22 --> 01:33:40.22 That is crazy.
01:33:40.22 --> 01:33:42.70 You freaking conduct this horrible operation.
01:33:42.70 --> 01:33:47.34 So many people die and you just continue being in charge and directing operations.
01:33:47.34 --> 01:33:52.70 Hague was unimaginative, maybe he was competent according to his lights, but these were
01:33:52.70 --> 01:33:56.78 dim, confidence of divine approval appeared to satisfy him.
01:33:56.78 --> 01:33:59.70 Nothing can excuse the casualties of the Psalm and passion dale.
01:33:59.70 --> 01:34:05.66 World War I, freaking nightmare.
01:34:05.66 --> 01:34:08.50 So what's up with his personality?
01:34:08.50 --> 01:34:13.46 Did Hague evince those character traits that are associated with authoritarianism?
01:34:13.46 --> 01:34:15.26 He certainly had most of them.
01:34:15.26 --> 01:34:19.06 First start he was conservative, conventional and it is added to toward the French
01:34:19.06 --> 01:34:26.26 Eiffnose centric, his diary and dispatch is suggest he was unemotional and totally anti-interceptive
01:34:26.26 --> 01:34:30.30 IE not one to reflect upon his own motives.
01:34:30.30 --> 01:34:34.34 He was manifestly lacking in compassion towards his fellow men.
01:34:34.34 --> 01:34:38.42 It's just so important to hear these things, just to think, what do you think a military
01:34:38.42 --> 01:34:43.54 commander should be like and what should a military commander actually be like?
01:34:43.54 --> 01:34:49.02 He was a confirmed believer in the direction of events by supernatural powers and reserved
01:34:49.02 --> 01:34:52.62 to the point of being verbally almost inarticulate.
01:34:52.62 --> 01:34:58.78 Hague also betrayed that triad of traits which, according to contemporary research, defines
01:34:58.78 --> 01:35:04.94 the obsessive character and correlated with authoritarianism.
01:35:04.94 --> 01:35:09.30 He was obstinate, orderly and mean.
01:35:09.30 --> 01:35:13.66 About his obstinacy, little further need to be said from the beginning to the end his handling
01:35:13.66 --> 01:35:19.10 of the 30 braze, betoken and obscenancy of statuesque proportions.
01:35:19.10 --> 01:35:21.14 His gallouge is stubborn, never changed his mind.
01:35:21.14 --> 01:35:22.70 We're sticking with the plan.
01:35:22.70 --> 01:35:26.86 For the second trait in his dress, habits and appearance, Hague was a maculate, orderly and
01:35:26.86 --> 01:35:31.94 quite probably the cleanest man on the western front, a contemporary of his at Clifton,
01:35:31.94 --> 01:35:36.10 remembered him particularly for his cleanliness, a remarkable attribute to be recalled
01:35:36.10 --> 01:35:37.90 of a fellow schoolboy.
01:35:37.90 --> 01:35:43.42 In the first, for an example of his love of bull, there's this excerpt from a cavalryman,
01:35:43.42 --> 01:35:48.42 cavalryman's letter, quote, he had a personal escort consisting of a full troop of his own
01:35:48.42 --> 01:35:49.82 regimen.
01:35:49.82 --> 01:35:54.70 They were easily the smartest thing in France, not a buck a lot of place, stripes of gold for
01:35:54.70 --> 01:36:01.34 the NCOs, silver, great silver skull and crossbones, and quote, other writers have commented
01:36:01.34 --> 01:36:06.26 on his meticulous attention to my new detail and his habit of planning each day according
01:36:06.26 --> 01:36:07.82 to a set pattern.
01:36:07.82 --> 01:36:15.14 So there you go.
01:36:15.14 --> 01:36:20.50 Any breaks out, basically, saying Montgomery, out of those three was the best and had the
01:36:20.50 --> 01:36:26.66 least authoritarian nature, Kitchener, little bit more authoritarian, little bit worse performance
01:36:26.66 --> 01:36:33.74 and then finally you get to Hague, total authoritarian attitude, and well, the worst,
01:36:33.74 --> 01:36:36.94 example, and the worst leader.
01:36:36.94 --> 01:36:45.30 And now we're getting to the final chapter of this book, Six Podcasts, Deep Spinos.
01:36:45.30 --> 01:36:55.22 I went hard in the paint, retreat, this one's called, Hail, ye, indomitable heroes, hail,
01:36:55.22 --> 01:36:58.18 despite all of your generals, ye prevailed.
01:36:58.18 --> 01:37:03.06 That's from a land or who wrote a poem about the Crimean heroes and I just was talking
01:37:03.06 --> 01:37:04.90 about this, right?
01:37:04.90 --> 01:37:16.02 The Brits want, the Brits and their allies beat the Russian, despite their shitty leadership.
01:37:16.02 --> 01:37:21.06 Classwits, this does difficulty in seeing things correctly, which is one of the greatest
01:37:21.06 --> 01:37:27.06 sources of friction and war makes things appear quite different from what was expected.
01:37:27.06 --> 01:37:29.54 Good job, classmates.
01:37:29.54 --> 01:37:32.82 You know what you better learn how to do if you want to see things correctly, you better
01:37:32.82 --> 01:37:36.78 learn to detach, you better learn to take a step back, you better learn to put your ego
01:37:36.78 --> 01:37:39.86 and check, you better learn to get control over your emotions, so you're not seeing through
01:37:39.86 --> 01:37:45.78 an e-gatistical or emotional lens.
01:37:45.78 --> 01:37:51.14 It is not the intention to leave a comparable impression of general ship, but rather to
01:37:51.14 --> 01:37:59.06 show that the nature of interspicy, that the nature of interspicy's aggression predisposes
01:37:59.06 --> 01:38:04.66 the leaders of armies and navies to certain sorts of error.
01:38:04.66 --> 01:38:08.46 So you're saying, look, when you start fighting and killing each other, it leads to certain
01:38:08.46 --> 01:38:12.26 types of error, just in its own right.
01:38:12.26 --> 01:38:18.58 Then he says, from far from diminishing the stature of senior military commanders, the existence
01:38:18.58 --> 01:38:25.18 of this predisposition makes the performance of the majority of soldiers and sailors doubly
01:38:25.18 --> 01:38:26.66 credible.
01:38:26.66 --> 01:38:33.66 So there's so much natural disaster about to happen that when someone does a good job,
01:38:33.66 --> 01:38:37.34 you should get double credit, two gold stars.
01:38:37.34 --> 01:38:43.66 For being able to pull it off, when there's all this natural gravity towards chaos, may
01:38:43.66 --> 01:38:49.90 have destruction, ego, authoritarian personalities, all that stuff is going on and yet some
01:38:49.90 --> 01:38:55.70 people's most military people from the bottom to the top do a good job and overcome
01:38:55.70 --> 01:38:56.70 that.
01:38:56.70 --> 01:39:00.70 So you should get double the credit.
01:39:00.70 --> 01:39:02.98 And this is all kind of a conclusion here.
01:39:02.98 --> 01:39:07.78 The theory advanced in this book starts from the position that by its very nature, military
01:39:07.78 --> 01:39:10.82 incompetence cannot be attributed to the dullness of intellect.
01:39:10.82 --> 01:39:12.14 We've hammered that point home.
01:39:12.14 --> 01:39:13.14 There is.
01:39:13.14 --> 01:39:16.70 It seems a reoccurring pattern to military messaps, which defies any explanation in terms
01:39:16.70 --> 01:39:17.70 of the bloody full theory.
01:39:17.70 --> 01:39:20.70 So these people aren't stupid.
01:39:20.70 --> 01:39:27.02 It is, and instead is tentatively suggested that the syndrome occurs through the enormous
01:39:27.02 --> 01:39:33.18 difficulties of professionalizing the instinctual activity of interest species aggression.
01:39:33.18 --> 01:39:41.26 This professionalism entails the growth of militarism, that collection of rules and conventions
01:39:41.26 --> 01:39:45.22 whereby hostility is controlled and anxiety reduced.
01:39:45.22 --> 01:39:53.46 So you've got this system set up to put command in place to reduce anxiety to overcome
01:39:53.46 --> 01:39:55.22 some natural instincts.
01:39:55.22 --> 01:39:58.30 That's what the military set up to do.
01:39:58.30 --> 01:40:04.14 Not surprisingly, a military career attracts a minority of people with these sort of anxieties
01:40:04.14 --> 01:40:06.14 within a military organization.
01:40:06.14 --> 01:40:07.78 Their neurotic needs are gratified.
01:40:07.78 --> 01:40:12.46 They, for their part, help to reinforce those very aspects of militarism, which are so
01:40:12.46 --> 01:40:17.82 congealed to their requirements in return as it were for fitting in so well.
01:40:17.82 --> 01:40:23.34 They may rise to positions of considerable power once they become incapacitated by the very
01:40:23.34 --> 01:40:26.34 characteristics, which hasten to their assent.
01:40:26.34 --> 01:40:28.74 You come in, you're authoritarian, you love it.
01:40:28.74 --> 01:40:32.70 You come in because you're authoritarian and you want to fit into that, then you get in there
01:40:32.70 --> 01:40:37.42 and you're gratified because that in your advance because you're authoritarian.
01:40:37.42 --> 01:40:41.86 And if you make it all the way up, the chain of command, the very authoritarian traits
01:40:41.86 --> 01:40:45.14 that you have are actually a disaster.
01:40:45.14 --> 01:40:48.50 So this is a horrible thing.
01:40:48.50 --> 01:40:52.70 And it took me six podcasts to get that out.
01:40:52.70 --> 01:40:55.58 So much for a theory based on past history.
01:40:55.58 --> 01:40:59.66 Has it, and he kind of goes, okay, look, I've showed you all these examples, which this book,
01:40:59.66 --> 01:41:02.98 450 pages of this book is examples.
01:41:02.98 --> 01:41:06.18 But he says so much for this theory based on a past history.
01:41:06.18 --> 01:41:07.86 Has it any relevance for the future?
01:41:07.86 --> 01:41:14.38 Since armies and navies have changed out of all recognition, perhaps the sorts of military
01:41:14.38 --> 01:41:19.78 incompetence described in these pages are no longer likely to occur.
01:41:19.78 --> 01:41:23.22 In fact, the evidence suggests this to be a foreloin hope.
01:41:23.22 --> 01:41:25.18 So this shit still happens.
01:41:25.18 --> 01:41:30.46 Some of the same sorts of mistakes occur now as blighted the lives of soldiers 100 years
01:41:30.46 --> 01:41:31.46 ago.
01:41:31.46 --> 01:41:37.02 In Vietnam, in three weeks, in 1968, the Ted offense of a lone cost of the Americans 500
01:41:37.02 --> 01:41:42.38 dead in the South Vietnamese, 165,000 dead with 2 million refugees.
01:41:42.38 --> 01:41:43.70 Why did it happen?
01:41:43.70 --> 01:41:50.14 One reason was the inability to respond to unexpected military intelligence.
01:41:50.14 --> 01:41:51.06 Fast forward a little bit.
01:41:51.06 --> 01:41:55.50 Any doubts as to whether the three factors of remote control.
01:41:55.50 --> 01:41:59.82 He goes into a thing explaining how some of the changes that have taken place.
01:41:59.82 --> 01:42:01.74 One of them is remote control meaning we're now radios.
01:42:01.74 --> 01:42:03.78 We can micromanage people out on the battlefield.
01:42:03.78 --> 01:42:08.86 We make these big swollen staffs and all kinds of weaponry.
01:42:08.86 --> 01:42:10.30 Has this helped?
01:42:10.30 --> 01:42:12.06 Now do we have multiple people on a staff?
01:42:12.06 --> 01:42:15.18 Maybe they can help sort through some of these people that are incompetent.
01:42:15.18 --> 01:42:18.50 Or we have the power to see what's happening on the battlefield.
01:42:18.50 --> 01:42:22.22 Maybe we can make adjustments through remote control.
01:42:22.22 --> 01:42:23.86 We've got all these resources and weapons.
01:42:23.86 --> 01:42:24.86 Maybe that helps.
01:42:24.86 --> 01:42:25.86 So here's what he said.
01:42:25.86 --> 01:42:26.86 It doesn't help.
01:42:26.86 --> 01:42:29.82 He says any doubts to whether these three factors for remote control, swollen staffs and
01:42:29.82 --> 01:42:34.86 the wealth of resources made for incompetence are removed by the contemplation of Vietnam.
01:42:34.86 --> 01:42:39.50 In this most ill-conceived and horrible of wars, there was the commander in chief, Lyndon
01:42:39.50 --> 01:42:46.14 Johnson, aided by his advisors, dreaming of policies and even selecting targets at a nice
01:42:46.14 --> 01:42:49.26 safe distance of 12,000 miles.
01:42:49.26 --> 01:42:55.78 And there was the man on the spot, General West Moreland, a by no means unintelligent military
01:42:55.78 --> 01:43:01.10 commander, but be muzed by the sheer weight of destructive energy and aggressive notion
01:43:01.10 --> 01:43:03.78 supplied by his president.
01:43:03.78 --> 01:43:09.30 Together the Maca-Villian mind of the one coupled with the traditional military mind
01:43:09.30 --> 01:43:13.02 of the other produced a pattern of martial lunacy.
01:43:13.02 --> 01:43:18.54 So abject and appalling that it eventually did for both of them.
01:43:18.54 --> 01:43:23.58 Like the Boor leaders, a half-century earlier, earlier, the versatile General G-Op, this
01:43:23.58 --> 01:43:28.30 is the Vietnamese, North Vietnamese commander and his commander in chief, a little old man
01:43:28.30 --> 01:43:29.86 with a wispy beard.
01:43:29.86 --> 01:43:34.62 Ho Chi Minh made a huge professionally trained and over-equipped army of their enemies
01:43:34.62 --> 01:43:37.50 look utterly ridiculous and their leaders helplessly.
01:43:37.50 --> 01:43:42.66 I rate unfettered by traditional militarism, lacking in excessive brute force and without
01:43:42.66 --> 01:43:50.14 an obsession with capturing real estate, whole and job relied on poor men's strategy.
01:43:50.14 --> 01:43:54.66 Surprise deception and the ability to melt away, they relied on the fact that West Moreland
01:43:54.66 --> 01:44:00.38 would expand, expand his energies, swatting wherever they had last been heard of while they
01:44:00.38 --> 01:44:07.74 got ready to sting in somewhere else.
01:44:07.74 --> 01:44:12.90 Yeah, and it's one of the most fascinating thing, and when we covered General Mouse,
01:44:12.90 --> 01:44:18.18 like little red book, one thing that's so fascinating about this is what the communists
01:44:18.18 --> 01:44:23.78 do to win wars is utilize decentralized command and they do it great and then for the way
01:44:23.78 --> 01:44:27.22 they run their government, they decide to make it a foritary and in centralized, which
01:44:27.22 --> 01:44:34.10 is crazy, which is crazy, and that's exactly what that spells out right there.
01:44:34.10 --> 01:44:39.66 When we're in battle, decentralized command make things happen, small units out there acting
01:44:39.66 --> 01:44:43.10 independently with freedom, and then for the government, guess what, we're locking
01:44:43.10 --> 01:44:48.86 it all down, you're going to obey obey obey.
01:44:48.86 --> 01:44:54.38 This brings up yet another hazard of modern war, government by committee.
01:44:54.38 --> 01:44:58.82 Take the decision to invade Cuba with a group of crew, Cuban excitals, Bay of Pigs, and
01:44:58.82 --> 01:45:02.98 approving the CIA plan Kennedy and his advisors made six assumptions each was wrong.
01:45:02.98 --> 01:45:06.78 They assumed that no one would guess the US government was responsible for the invasion,
01:45:06.78 --> 01:45:10.42 and they're contempt for the Cuban Air Force, they assumed it would be annihilated before
01:45:10.42 --> 01:45:11.78 the invasion began.
01:45:11.78 --> 01:45:16.26 They assumed that the small invasion force led by unpopular ex-offices from the best
01:45:16.26 --> 01:45:21.46 teaser regime would be more than a match for Castro's quote, week army of 20,000 well-cooked
01:45:21.46 --> 01:45:26.22 Cuban troops, they assumed that the invasion would touch off a general revolt behind Castro's
01:45:26.22 --> 01:45:31.34 line, they assumed that even if unsuccessful in their primary objective, the ex-IL forces,
01:45:31.34 --> 01:45:38.14 the ex-IL force could hold up in Cuban reinforced anti-Castro guerrillas.
01:45:38.14 --> 01:45:42.10 What's their plan? Do assumption, assumption, assumption, assumption, and the event that
01:45:42.10 --> 01:45:47.70 each assumption proved a gross, in the event, each assumption proved a gross miscalculation.
01:45:47.70 --> 01:45:48.70 Nothing went as planned.
01:45:48.70 --> 01:45:53.30 Nobody believed the CIA covered story that ships carrying reserve ammunition for the invasion
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:54.70 force failed to arrive.
01:45:54.70 --> 01:45:59.10 Two were sunk in two fled by the second day, and the invaders were surrounded by Castro's
01:45:59.10 --> 01:46:01.82 army and by the third day they were either dead or behind bars.
01:46:01.82 --> 01:46:04.74 Seven months later, the United States recovered what was left of their invasion force
01:46:04.74 --> 01:46:10.74 for a ransom price to Castro of $53 million, Kennedy was stricken.
01:46:10.74 --> 01:46:15.22 How could I have been so stupid as to let them go ahead he asked?
01:46:15.22 --> 01:46:19.66 As Sornson wrote, his anguish was doubly deepened by the knowledge that the rest of the
01:46:19.66 --> 01:46:21.86 world was asking the same question.
01:46:21.86 --> 01:46:27.14 Arthur Slesinger, Jr., noted that Kennedy would sometimes refer incredulously to the Bay
01:46:27.14 --> 01:46:32.98 of Pigs, wondering how irrational and responsible government could have big common involved
01:46:32.98 --> 01:46:39.66 in so an ill-start adventure.
01:46:39.66 --> 01:46:44.22 Sonded is 77, 7, 1941 had been set aside by Admiral Kimmel Commander Chief of the
01:46:44.22 --> 01:46:50.86 Pacific Fleet for a friendly game of golf with his colleague General Short.
01:46:50.86 --> 01:46:56.30 96 of his ships, the American Fleet slept at anchor in the harbor American plane, stood
01:46:56.30 --> 01:47:01.06 a wing-tipped wing-tipped on the tarmac, American servicemen were off duty and doing weekend
01:47:01.06 --> 01:47:05.62 leave by the end of the day, Pearl Harbor with the ships planes and military installations
01:47:05.62 --> 01:47:09.90 had been reduced to smoking ruins, 2000 service men have been killed and many more wounded
01:47:09.90 --> 01:47:11.62 are missing.
01:47:11.62 --> 01:47:14.30 By the end of the day, Kimmel was offering to resign.
01:47:14.30 --> 01:47:17.42 Later he was court-martialed, reprimanded and demoted to a position where he's never
01:47:17.42 --> 01:47:20.06 again required to make decisions of any consequence.
01:47:20.06 --> 01:47:24.58 Pearl Harbor, like the Bay of Pigs, confirmed once again that military incompetence is
01:47:24.58 --> 01:47:33.22 more often a product of personality characteristics than of intellectual shortcomings.
01:47:33.22 --> 01:47:40.78 For these American disasters show very clearly that even combined intellect and specialized
01:47:40.78 --> 01:47:46.58 knowledge of highly intelligent and dedicated men are no proof against decision so totally
01:47:46.58 --> 01:47:52.98 unrealistic and subsequently to tax the credually of even those who had made them.
01:47:52.98 --> 01:48:00.74 Far from diminishing the chances of an aptitude, the group actually accentuates the effects
01:48:00.74 --> 01:48:08.94 of those very traits which may lead to incompetence in individual commanders.
01:48:08.94 --> 01:48:13.62 So you get a group together and you'd think that this would kind of cancel out and say,
01:48:13.62 --> 01:48:15.30 hey, heck, I don't have that's a good idea.
01:48:15.30 --> 01:48:16.66 No, it actually gets worse.
01:48:16.66 --> 01:48:17.86 It turns into groupthink.
01:48:17.86 --> 01:48:25.30 The symptoms of this process, which Janice terms groupthink include, one, and illusion of
01:48:25.30 --> 01:48:30.82 invulnerability that becomes shared by most members of the group.
01:48:30.82 --> 01:48:37.22 Two, collective attempts to ignore rationalize a way, items of information which might
01:48:37.22 --> 01:48:41.70 otherwise leave the group to reconsider shaky but cherish assumptions.
01:48:41.70 --> 01:48:47.82 Three, an unquestion belief in the groups inherent morality, busson-nabling members to overlook
01:48:47.82 --> 01:48:51.86 ethical consequences of their decision.
01:48:51.86 --> 01:48:57.26 Four, stereotyping the enemy as either too evil from negotiation or too stupid and
01:48:57.26 --> 01:49:01.34 feeble to be a threat.
01:49:01.34 --> 01:49:04.38 You can see, you can hear this happening in the room, right?
01:49:04.38 --> 01:49:06.66 You can hear the discussions happening.
01:49:06.66 --> 01:49:13.90 A shared illusion of unenemity in a majority viewpoint augmented by the false assumption
01:49:13.90 --> 01:49:24.14 that silence means consent and six self-appointed mind guards to protect the group from adverse
01:49:24.14 --> 01:49:33.86 information that might shatter complacency about the effectiveness and morality of their decisions.
01:49:33.86 --> 01:49:40.26 That's what happens when you put a bunch of people that have these tendencies into a group
01:49:40.26 --> 01:49:45.50 together, it gets a worse.
01:49:45.50 --> 01:49:49.02 This is the last thing I'm going to read from the book here.
01:49:49.02 --> 01:49:56.46 Finally, it is worth noting that the personality determined malaise of groupthink produces
01:49:56.46 --> 01:50:03.34 once again those four most frequently occurring symptoms of past military incompetence,
01:50:03.34 --> 01:50:05.70 wastage of manpower.
01:50:05.70 --> 01:50:16.02 Everconfidence under estimation of the enemy and ignoring of intelligence reports, these
01:50:16.02 --> 01:50:26.46 it seems are the enduring hazards of professionalizing violence.
01:50:26.46 --> 01:50:30.70 And I can tell you these are not only the hazards of professionalizing violence, these
01:50:30.70 --> 01:50:39.78 are the enduring hazards for us as human beings, as leaders, that we can all fall into.
01:50:39.78 --> 01:50:44.26 And as you pointed out, this book is a big warning of what not to do.
01:50:44.26 --> 01:50:47.86 I got it, I said it was the last thing I'm going to read, but there's a, look, this guy's
01:50:47.86 --> 01:50:51.82 funny and I did a bad job of relaying some of this humor.
01:50:51.82 --> 01:50:54.30 Here's the after word of this book.
01:50:54.30 --> 01:50:57.70 And then this is the last thing I'm going to read from this book after six podcasts.
01:50:57.70 --> 01:51:02.34 He says, this is so British.
01:51:02.34 --> 01:51:06.46 He says, let's the readers should have doubted my qualifications to write this book.
01:51:06.46 --> 01:51:13.62 Let me assure him that I have marked authoritarian traits a week ago, fear of failure
01:51:13.62 --> 01:51:20.10 motivation and no illusions about the fact that I would have made a grossly incompetent
01:51:20.10 --> 01:51:21.98 general.
01:51:21.98 --> 01:51:24.78 It takes one to no one.
01:51:24.78 --> 01:51:26.50 That was from the author in 1935.
01:51:26.50 --> 01:51:27.50 A little bit of humor.
01:51:27.50 --> 01:51:32.14 And he says it takes one to no one.
01:51:32.14 --> 01:51:34.14 But that's unfortunately not true.
01:51:34.14 --> 01:51:37.74 It's unfortunately not true.
01:51:37.74 --> 01:51:45.30 If you think you're incompetent, there's a better chance that you're not incompetent.
01:51:45.30 --> 01:51:47.02 You can see where I'm going this.
01:51:47.02 --> 01:51:50.90 If you think you're incompetent, there's a better chance that you're not incompetent.
01:51:50.90 --> 01:51:54.70 Because if you think you're incompetent, you're actually humble and you're thinking, ooh,
01:51:54.70 --> 01:52:00.38 I don't know if I need to listen to one of the people I have to say, I need to check myself.
01:52:00.38 --> 01:52:03.26 I need to learn, I need to open my mind and see what other information I can grab
01:52:03.26 --> 01:52:07.34 or because I've got to feel like I might be incompetent.
01:52:07.34 --> 01:52:12.54 If you feel like it's kind of when people ask me about the imposter syndrome, what if
01:52:12.54 --> 01:52:13.54 I'm impostering it?
01:52:13.54 --> 01:52:14.54 Good.
01:52:14.54 --> 01:52:16.98 That means you're actually thinking, man, do I even believe need to be?
01:52:16.98 --> 01:52:17.98 I always had that.
01:52:17.98 --> 01:52:21.70 I always felt like, oh man, if I'm going to need to be making decisions, I better do my
01:52:21.70 --> 01:52:22.70 homework.
01:52:22.70 --> 01:52:26.70 I better think this through a better pay attention.
01:52:26.70 --> 01:52:30.78 So if you think you're incompetent, you probably aren't.
01:52:30.78 --> 01:52:35.38 But if you've been listening to these six straight podcasts and you've been thinking
01:52:35.38 --> 01:52:38.90 that this book is about all the incompetent leaders around you, that's the little warning
01:52:38.90 --> 01:52:40.30 sign.
01:52:40.30 --> 01:52:46.26 Be careful because if you are in that mindset where you think, man, I can't believe how
01:52:46.26 --> 01:52:49.18 jacked up all these other leaders are.
01:52:49.18 --> 01:52:58.06 So not you, red flag because chances are, this is about you.
01:52:58.06 --> 01:53:00.42 And look, here's the other red flag.
01:53:00.42 --> 01:53:01.74 It's a scale, right?
01:53:01.74 --> 01:53:02.74 You brought that up.
01:53:02.74 --> 01:53:06.06 It's a continuum.
01:53:06.06 --> 01:53:12.50 And so we all of us, even if you feel like you're pretty competent, you are under threat
01:53:12.50 --> 01:53:15.06 of being dragged to incompetency.
01:53:15.06 --> 01:53:18.50 So all these little, this book is just a warning sign after a warning sign after a warning
01:53:18.50 --> 01:53:22.26 sign and by the way, there's nothing new.
01:53:22.26 --> 01:53:23.50 There's almost nothing new.
01:53:23.50 --> 01:53:25.30 There's one thing that I said, that's a new thought to me.
01:53:25.30 --> 01:53:26.66 I forget what it was.
01:53:26.66 --> 01:53:32.06 But in these 400 pages and whatever we just did 12, 15 hours worth of podcasts, it's
01:53:32.06 --> 01:53:33.78 all, it's a rehash.
01:53:33.78 --> 01:53:37.66 It's a reinforcement of information that I already knew that we already knew that we
01:53:37.66 --> 01:53:42.22 talk about all the time, that we've seen it a bunch of other situations.
01:53:42.22 --> 01:53:43.94 It's a rehash.
01:53:43.94 --> 01:53:51.14 But we're all getting, we can all get pulled, over there, we can get pulled towards
01:53:51.14 --> 01:53:52.14 that authoritarian mindset.
01:53:52.14 --> 01:53:54.74 Because, you know why we get pulled towards the authoritarian mindset?
01:53:54.74 --> 01:53:59.06 We get pulled towards that authoritarian mindset because it seems easier.
01:53:59.06 --> 01:54:01.70 It seems easier to say, shut up and do what I told you to do.
01:54:01.70 --> 01:54:02.70 It seems easier to say, you know what?
01:54:02.70 --> 01:54:05.34 I'm not going to listen to that piece of information.
01:54:05.34 --> 01:54:07.58 It seems easier to do that.
01:54:07.58 --> 01:54:10.78 It seems like the right move.
01:54:10.78 --> 01:54:12.38 It seems easier to say, you know what?
01:54:12.38 --> 01:54:15.34 The competitor's never going to be able to do what we're doing.
01:54:15.34 --> 01:54:20.06 It seems easier and it's not.
01:54:20.06 --> 01:54:21.06 So you got to get watched.
01:54:21.06 --> 01:54:22.06 You got to watch out.
01:54:22.06 --> 01:54:23.06 You got to pay attention.
01:54:23.06 --> 01:54:24.06 You got to be careful.
01:54:24.06 --> 01:54:26.50 We all have to be on guard in competence.
01:54:26.50 --> 01:54:28.62 In competence is out there sort of ready to attach.
01:54:28.62 --> 01:54:29.78 It's ready to attach.
01:54:29.78 --> 01:54:30.78 Yes.
01:54:30.78 --> 01:54:32.62 And if you're not on guard, it'll grab you.
01:54:32.62 --> 01:54:36.02 It'll pull you down and you'll be making bad decisions and getting people killed or ruining
01:54:36.02 --> 01:54:41.26 your business or ruining your marriage or ruining your life through incompetence.
01:54:41.26 --> 01:54:43.26 So we have to pay attention.
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:46.50 You got to be careful.
01:54:46.50 --> 01:54:47.50 We got to stay on the path.
01:54:47.50 --> 01:54:48.50 Yes.
01:54:48.50 --> 01:54:49.50 The path.
01:54:49.50 --> 01:54:52.94 Speaking of where it's, you know?
01:54:52.94 --> 01:54:53.98 What do you got for us?
01:54:53.98 --> 01:54:54.98 How do you advise?
01:54:54.98 --> 01:54:56.98 We avoid incompetence.
01:54:56.98 --> 01:54:57.98 We avoid incompetence.
01:54:57.98 --> 01:54:58.98 Mental incompetence.
01:54:58.98 --> 01:54:59.98 Leadership incompetence.
01:54:59.98 --> 01:55:00.98 Physical incompetence.
01:55:00.98 --> 01:55:01.98 Physical incompetence.
01:55:01.98 --> 01:55:04.38 We don't want to have that.
01:55:04.38 --> 01:55:05.38 What do you got for us?
01:55:05.38 --> 01:55:06.38 Second trial.
01:55:06.38 --> 01:55:12.30 Because the Dunning Kruger effect that you kind of referred to, where the, it takes one
01:55:12.30 --> 01:55:15.70 to know on that's not necessarily true.
01:55:15.70 --> 01:55:20.50 Yeah, that it feels like when you, you think you know everything.
01:55:20.50 --> 01:55:24.30 It's like it's easy to know everything when you think there's only like three or four things
01:55:24.30 --> 01:55:25.30 to know.
01:55:25.30 --> 01:55:29.30 But then when you start due to it and you're like, man, once I know how to stop that
01:55:29.30 --> 01:55:30.70 on lock, I'll be good.
01:55:30.70 --> 01:55:31.70 Kind of be it.
01:55:31.70 --> 01:55:32.70 Yeah.
01:55:32.70 --> 01:55:33.70 Because you got on lock three times.
01:55:33.70 --> 01:55:34.70 Yeah.
01:55:34.70 --> 01:55:37.62 You're in a random, you know, blue belt, you're like, oh, dude, I'm gonna stop that.
01:55:37.62 --> 01:55:39.22 And then you get your toe figured it out.
01:55:39.22 --> 01:55:40.42 And you feel like I'm not gonna stop the choke.
01:55:40.42 --> 01:55:41.42 Then you know, heel hook.
01:55:41.42 --> 01:55:42.42 Yeah, I do.
01:55:42.42 --> 01:55:43.42 I'm not gonna stop that heel hook.
01:55:43.42 --> 01:55:44.42 Yeah, just goes on.
01:55:44.42 --> 01:55:45.42 Yeah.
01:55:45.42 --> 01:55:49.10 Yeah, so the guy who actually does stop after like you get heel hooked, armedlocked, a
01:55:49.10 --> 01:55:51.26 zeeke heel choked, freaking.
01:55:51.26 --> 01:55:52.54 Then you go, oh, there's a lot more.
01:55:52.54 --> 01:55:53.54 I don't know what I'm doing.
01:55:53.54 --> 01:55:54.54 Yes.
01:55:54.54 --> 01:55:56.66 So it's a minute to convince you of that.
01:55:56.66 --> 01:55:57.66 Yeah.
01:55:57.66 --> 01:56:02.02 So that's when you kind of, when the, it's all the Dunning Kruger effect.
01:56:02.02 --> 01:56:06.22 It's essentially like, yeah, when you think you people who are like so confident, they're
01:56:06.22 --> 01:56:09.42 the ones that know less than the people who are like not confident at all because they know
01:56:09.42 --> 01:56:10.74 how much there is not to know.
01:56:10.74 --> 01:56:12.74 You know, they have a grasp on it or whatever.
01:56:12.74 --> 01:56:14.98 Yeah, Dave, good deal, Dave.
01:56:14.98 --> 01:56:15.98 Said something.
01:56:15.98 --> 01:56:18.94 I forget his exact words, but I wish I remembered it.
01:56:18.94 --> 01:56:22.14 It was something like, oh, yeah, when he's talking about you, you're just a, he was like,
01:56:22.14 --> 01:56:26.50 um, yeah, it's almost like you get, you learn what he said.
01:56:26.50 --> 01:56:28.78 It's almost like you get worse over time.
01:56:28.78 --> 01:56:31.50 Because yesterday there was only three things I didn't know.
01:56:31.50 --> 01:56:33.86 Like now there's like 40 things that don't know.
01:56:33.86 --> 01:56:34.86 I don't know.
01:56:34.86 --> 01:56:35.86 There's a thousand.
01:56:35.86 --> 01:56:36.86 Yeah.
01:56:36.86 --> 01:56:40.14 With a day that you start to look, start to feel okay as when you go, oh, there's
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:41.14 an infinite number of things.
01:56:41.14 --> 01:56:42.14 Yeah.
01:56:42.14 --> 01:56:43.14 I just don't know anything.
01:56:43.14 --> 01:56:44.14 Yeah.
01:56:44.14 --> 01:56:45.14 Take a look.
01:56:45.14 --> 01:56:47.58 Well, so we want to know stuff.
01:56:47.58 --> 01:56:49.58 Hey, complacency, right?
01:56:49.58 --> 01:56:50.58 complacency.
01:56:50.58 --> 01:56:51.58 That's one of the deals.
01:56:51.58 --> 01:57:00.78 It's like your whole brain and body, but brain, trying to, trying to like be lazy for
01:57:00.78 --> 01:57:05.14 lack of a better term, like I said before, trying to save energy, trying to save work,
01:57:05.14 --> 01:57:07.74 like when you do more work or less work.
01:57:07.74 --> 01:57:08.74 Yep.
01:57:08.74 --> 01:57:10.74 She was saying it's like a Rubik's cube.
01:57:10.74 --> 01:57:12.86 You're, are you good at Rubik's cube?
01:57:12.86 --> 01:57:13.86 Yeah.
01:57:13.86 --> 01:57:14.86 You are.
01:57:14.86 --> 01:57:15.86 Yeah, you know the formula.
01:57:15.86 --> 01:57:19.30 Yep, I know all the algorithms to get the sides, termed up, right?
01:57:19.30 --> 01:57:20.30 This good.
01:57:20.30 --> 01:57:21.30 Well, let's say you didn't.
01:57:21.30 --> 01:57:23.34 Well, actually, not just kid riding on your room.
01:57:23.34 --> 01:57:28.42 That kind of surprised me when I was like, damn, all right.
01:57:28.42 --> 01:57:30.10 That's like if you say new how to play the piano.
01:57:30.10 --> 01:57:31.10 But it is an algorithm.
01:57:31.10 --> 01:57:32.10 Yeah, yeah.
01:57:32.10 --> 01:57:33.10 Yeah, yeah.
01:57:33.10 --> 01:57:34.10 Yeah, yeah.
01:57:34.10 --> 01:57:35.10 It's like a little like a literature.
01:57:35.10 --> 01:57:36.10 A little steps.
01:57:36.10 --> 01:57:37.10 Yes, yes, exactly right.
01:57:37.10 --> 01:57:39.90 Like yeah, it's a little formula for sure.
01:57:39.90 --> 01:57:43.90 But whether you know the formula or not, I would imagine that, let's say you got that
01:57:43.90 --> 01:57:44.90 thing figured out.
01:57:44.90 --> 01:57:45.90 Right.
01:57:45.90 --> 01:57:51.30 But then on one side, you got that one freaking different color on the side.
01:57:51.30 --> 01:57:53.98 Just the one, you know that's not just one move.
01:57:53.98 --> 01:57:57.02 That's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know,
01:57:57.02 --> 01:57:59.02 you know, there's like, oh, you know the formula.
01:57:59.02 --> 01:58:02.26 It was like 13 moves, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
01:58:02.26 --> 01:58:03.78 left left up to two, two, five.
01:58:03.78 --> 01:58:06.86 But it would imagine it would be like multiples of four for some reason.
01:58:06.86 --> 01:58:08.98 I don't know why I think that could be right.
01:58:08.98 --> 01:58:09.98 Could be wrong.
01:58:09.98 --> 01:58:10.98 There's the deal.
01:58:10.98 --> 01:58:11.98 Let me ask you this.
01:58:11.98 --> 01:58:15.90 What, you know, I was the kid and when we were, we just creeped came out.
01:58:15.90 --> 01:58:19.82 It took me like no less than, you know, 15 minutes to figure out how to break that thing
01:58:19.82 --> 01:58:20.82 apart.
01:58:20.82 --> 01:58:21.82 Oh, yeah, assemble it in the correct order.
01:58:21.82 --> 01:58:22.82 Yeah.
01:58:22.82 --> 01:58:25.74 And then actually, that's smart to do in a couple of, yeah.
01:58:25.74 --> 01:58:26.74 It's creative.
01:58:26.74 --> 01:58:27.74 Put it this way.
01:58:27.74 --> 01:58:28.74 Yeah, that's the thing.
01:58:28.74 --> 01:58:31.70 This might, I'm not saying you were creative because I don't know.
01:58:31.70 --> 01:58:34.22 But you seem like the type, you didn't do it out of creativity.
01:58:34.22 --> 01:58:38.74 You did it just out of like brute-fucking jacco.
01:58:38.74 --> 01:58:39.98 Yes.
01:58:39.98 --> 01:58:41.70 But when you break it, that's not the night.
01:58:41.70 --> 01:58:42.98 I just broke jacco.
01:58:42.98 --> 01:58:45.98 It's just like, hey, yeah, I'm going to solve this problem.
01:58:45.98 --> 01:58:47.58 It's direct way I can.
01:58:47.58 --> 01:58:51.54 But if you look at those rules, you take it all apart.
01:58:51.54 --> 01:58:55.98 It the last pieces, those center pieces, kind of tell a little bit of a story.
01:58:55.98 --> 01:58:56.98 Yeah.
01:58:56.98 --> 01:58:58.38 You can, they're stuck there.
01:58:58.38 --> 01:59:00.06 But no, I think you take them out.
01:59:00.06 --> 01:59:02.18 You could pop off like this little star thing.
01:59:02.18 --> 01:59:03.46 Yeah, yeah, it would make less sense.
01:59:03.46 --> 01:59:04.46 Exactly.
01:59:04.46 --> 01:59:05.46 That's what I'm saying.
01:59:05.46 --> 01:59:06.46 It tells a little story there.
01:59:06.46 --> 01:59:11.82 So you're like, oh, I see, then maybe, I don't know what you do to then put them back
01:59:11.82 --> 01:59:12.82 together.
01:59:12.82 --> 01:59:14.46 Here's another way to do it.
01:59:14.46 --> 01:59:16.26 All the colors are little stickers.
01:59:16.26 --> 01:59:17.26 Oh, God.
01:59:17.26 --> 01:59:18.26 Yeah.
01:59:18.26 --> 01:59:20.54 The last brute wave doing that a little bit more sophisticated.
01:59:20.54 --> 01:59:21.54 It is.
01:59:21.54 --> 01:59:22.54 I don't know.
01:59:22.54 --> 01:59:24.74 So you got like glue all over your freaking hands.
01:59:24.74 --> 01:59:26.34 I didn't say it was perfect to you.
01:59:26.34 --> 01:59:27.90 And then say it was perfect.
01:59:27.90 --> 01:59:29.70 Either way, that's the frustration.
01:59:29.70 --> 01:59:30.70 You got it all figured out.
01:59:30.70 --> 01:59:32.54 You're going to use it for like, in seconds.
01:59:32.54 --> 01:59:33.54 Yeah, the way.
01:59:33.54 --> 01:59:34.54 Oh, yeah.
01:59:34.54 --> 01:59:35.94 You're going to use it for like a second.
01:59:35.94 --> 01:59:36.94 So Rubius Cube is what?
01:59:36.94 --> 01:59:38.38 It's nine on each side, right?
01:59:38.38 --> 01:59:39.38 Right?
01:59:39.38 --> 01:59:44.78 You're seeing those ones with like, freaking like 64 squares on each side or whatever.
01:59:44.78 --> 01:59:45.78 I have not.
01:59:45.78 --> 01:59:46.78 They're not.
01:59:46.78 --> 01:59:47.78 And guys will do them too.
01:59:47.78 --> 01:59:49.58 In like a time lapse or whatever.
01:59:49.58 --> 01:59:51.94 Nonetheless, you see my point.
01:59:51.94 --> 01:59:54.26 No, I have no idea what you think you got.
01:59:54.26 --> 01:59:56.90 You think you got things figured out in life.
01:59:56.90 --> 02:00:01.74 Then you get this one lone idea that kind of jams up your whole way of thinking.
02:00:01.74 --> 02:00:03.54 Just that one.
02:00:03.54 --> 02:00:08.46 It's way easier to take off that sticker or maybe just turn it to the side where you can't
02:00:08.46 --> 02:00:09.46 see that thing.
02:00:09.46 --> 02:00:10.46 It's way easier.
02:00:10.46 --> 02:00:11.46 Okay.
02:00:11.46 --> 02:00:13.82 Safe way, way more energy.
02:00:13.82 --> 02:00:17.94 But the reality is the correct thing to do is, bro, you got to know that algorithm,
02:00:17.94 --> 02:00:18.94 the formula.
02:00:18.94 --> 02:00:21.14 It's going to take some steps and take some more work.
02:00:21.14 --> 02:00:22.78 But at the end of the day, you're going to have a correct.
02:00:22.78 --> 02:00:23.78 That's what I think.
02:00:23.78 --> 02:00:24.78 Okay.
02:00:24.78 --> 02:00:25.78 It's the 100% wrong.
02:00:25.78 --> 02:00:27.78 And that's what you got to think in a way.
02:00:27.78 --> 02:00:28.78 So amazing.
02:00:28.78 --> 02:00:35.18 Like it's even your attitude right now is telling me that you might be feeling the effects
02:00:35.18 --> 02:00:39.18 of the what he called, well, how'd you put it, like slipping off the path?
02:00:39.18 --> 02:00:42.42 You know, my mind is so close to your freaking metaphors right now.
02:00:42.42 --> 02:00:44.42 Let's ridiculous.
02:00:44.42 --> 02:00:46.30 Anyway, we're working out.
02:00:46.30 --> 02:00:47.30 It's squat season.
02:00:47.30 --> 02:00:50.30 By the way, I heard my apparently it's squat season.
02:00:50.30 --> 02:00:51.30 Back to squat.
02:00:51.30 --> 02:00:52.30 That's the worst.
02:00:52.30 --> 02:00:53.30 So we're on the path.
02:00:53.30 --> 02:00:54.30 Stay in there.
02:00:54.30 --> 02:00:58.10 The beginning of squat season, the beginning of any physical related season.
02:00:58.10 --> 02:01:04.30 If there's any more in squat season, it's going to be painful, especially the beginning.
02:01:04.30 --> 02:01:09.14 If you go snowboarding the first day of snowboarding season, that day you're going to have
02:01:09.14 --> 02:01:10.14 dawn.
02:01:10.14 --> 02:01:11.14 It should be sore.
02:01:11.14 --> 02:01:12.14 It seems like anyway.
02:01:12.14 --> 02:01:15.14 My point is you're going to need some supplementation here and there.
02:01:15.14 --> 02:01:16.14 You know, it's no problem.
02:01:16.14 --> 02:01:17.14 We got some for you.
02:01:17.14 --> 02:01:18.14 Jocco has some for you.
02:01:18.14 --> 02:01:19.14 Jocco feel.
02:01:19.14 --> 02:01:20.14 That was a long wrap.
02:01:20.14 --> 02:01:23.30 Let's start with the energy drinks.
02:01:23.30 --> 02:01:25.34 See, this is not seasonal.
02:01:25.34 --> 02:01:27.94 This is your own energy drink.
02:01:27.94 --> 02:01:30.58 But not the tradition energy drink.
02:01:30.58 --> 02:01:33.18 This is a healthy energy drink.
02:01:33.18 --> 02:01:34.18 Energy health drink.
02:01:34.18 --> 02:01:35.46 Whatever you want to call it.
02:01:35.46 --> 02:01:36.46 All upside no downside.
02:01:36.46 --> 02:01:37.46 All healthy for you.
02:01:37.46 --> 02:01:40.42 You'll be healthier after you drink one or two.
02:01:40.42 --> 02:01:41.42 Seems same.
02:01:41.42 --> 02:01:51.18 By the way, there's a new pre workout powder formula, which JP to Mel did two dry
02:01:51.18 --> 02:01:52.18 scoops.
02:01:52.18 --> 02:01:56.06 And then the chaser of the sour apple sniper.
02:01:56.06 --> 02:02:00.10 But I did, I was talking to my daughter today.
02:02:00.10 --> 02:02:07.74 And she just did her first experience on the new powder, the new go powder.
02:02:07.74 --> 02:02:10.82 And while I was talking to her, she was on the roller.
02:02:10.82 --> 02:02:13.70 She didn't see to get net pole on poles.
02:02:13.70 --> 02:02:14.70 Chain out.
02:02:14.70 --> 02:02:16.62 Get that chain out, this her.
02:02:16.62 --> 02:02:22.14 And she was saying as she in between breaths that I won't even have.
02:02:22.14 --> 02:02:23.14 I wrote it in.
02:02:23.14 --> 02:02:25.26 But I took the go.
02:02:25.26 --> 02:02:28.06 It freaking hit.
02:02:28.06 --> 02:02:29.06 And that is a real thing.
02:02:29.06 --> 02:02:30.06 That's a real thing.
02:02:30.06 --> 02:02:31.06 Yeah.
02:02:31.06 --> 02:02:38.34 And I was an mention this before offline, where I'm no stranger to the jittery pre workout
02:02:38.34 --> 02:02:39.34 powders.
02:02:39.34 --> 02:02:42.06 I'm not scared of that kind of stuff.
02:02:42.06 --> 02:02:45.34 And in fact, you get the jitteres or whatever all that stuff.
02:02:45.34 --> 02:02:46.78 To me, that's no factor.
02:02:46.78 --> 02:02:50.66 And in fact, when you're tired and the jitteres hit you, I'd rather have jitteres than
02:02:50.66 --> 02:02:53.86 to be fired up to work out than not have jitteres than not be fired up.
02:02:53.86 --> 02:02:56.98 So I'm like, I'm not scared of that kind of stuff, right?
02:02:56.98 --> 02:02:59.30 And our jitter's necessary, though, that's the thing.
02:02:59.30 --> 02:03:01.82 That seems like we've discovered that we don't need them.
02:03:01.82 --> 02:03:03.62 I didn't even think about that stuff.
02:03:03.62 --> 02:03:05.78 To me, that's just what the pre workout was.
02:03:05.78 --> 02:03:06.78 Good.
02:03:06.78 --> 02:03:09.18 I'll take all of it, whatever you do whatever.
02:03:09.18 --> 02:03:10.18 But it is.
02:03:10.18 --> 02:03:11.18 And I read our realises.
02:03:11.18 --> 02:03:13.78 Because I heard people say like, oh yeah, you drink this like tea.
02:03:13.78 --> 02:03:14.98 They'd say this about some teas.
02:03:14.98 --> 02:03:17.86 Like yeah, you're up, but it's like a smooth or whatever.
02:03:17.86 --> 02:03:18.86 The smoothness or whatever.
02:03:18.86 --> 02:03:20.34 I'm like cool man, smoothness.
02:03:20.34 --> 02:03:21.34 Oh, good.
02:03:21.34 --> 02:03:22.34 Whatever.
02:03:22.34 --> 02:03:25.10 It just wasn't part of my world until I got the experience.
02:03:25.10 --> 02:03:28.90 So the pre workout I took it, my cool thing is I haven't been doing pre workout for
02:03:28.90 --> 02:03:30.54 like years now.
02:03:30.54 --> 02:03:31.54 So I took this one.
02:03:31.54 --> 02:03:32.54 I was like cool.
02:03:32.54 --> 02:03:35.94 No jitteres, so I'm thinking, maybe juck was just sort of scared of the pre workout
02:03:35.94 --> 02:03:36.94 experience.
02:03:36.94 --> 02:03:38.26 I get it, you know, a little bit more mild.
02:03:38.26 --> 02:03:40.46 I get it man, I get it.
02:03:40.46 --> 02:03:43.54 But when you start warming up, that's when you feel it.
02:03:43.54 --> 02:03:47.30 Like that when everything starts flowing, it's like it connects your brain to your freaking
02:03:47.30 --> 02:03:48.86 body more or something.
02:03:48.86 --> 02:03:49.86 That's a body experience.
02:03:49.86 --> 02:03:50.86 That's what I'm saying.
02:03:50.86 --> 02:03:53.38 Let me know in in in body experience.
02:03:53.38 --> 02:04:01.86 Nonetheless, what I'm saying is what your daughter was talking about, I understand.
02:04:01.86 --> 02:04:03.50 And it's true.
02:04:03.50 --> 02:04:08.38 And yeah, I think it had to reevaluate my whole standard of the pre workout.
02:04:08.38 --> 02:04:11.74 Because I knew like the pre workout I said I was taking, that's not good.
02:04:11.74 --> 02:04:12.74 That's why I stopped.
02:04:12.74 --> 02:04:13.74 Yeah.
02:04:13.74 --> 02:04:17.14 Because I'm like cool, it's working, but probably I know I'm jamming myself out
02:04:17.14 --> 02:04:18.14 of my heart.
02:04:18.14 --> 02:04:19.54 I don't know what I'm jamming up on the inside.
02:04:19.54 --> 02:04:20.54 But I'm jamming something up.
02:04:20.54 --> 02:04:24.98 And yeah, man, now I know the new standard.
02:04:24.98 --> 02:04:31.94 So you can get it that you can get your super hard workouts with a little extra kick.
02:04:31.94 --> 02:04:36.42 Which might mean you need to protect yourself from a joint perspective a little bit more.
02:04:36.42 --> 02:04:37.42 Let's go join warfare.
02:04:37.42 --> 02:04:39.42 Let's go super curl.
02:04:39.42 --> 02:04:45.54 Might as well keep your immunity in check because we're starting to work hard getting
02:04:45.54 --> 02:04:48.02 like a needing recovery.
02:04:48.02 --> 02:04:52.10 What, maybe the immune system's taking a little hit will get a little boost from some
02:04:52.10 --> 02:04:55.14 cold war, some vitamin B3.
02:04:55.14 --> 02:04:56.14 Kind of got you covered.
02:04:56.14 --> 02:05:00.34 Yeah, you know, when you kind of like go down the list, you kind of like, it's a whole system.
02:05:00.34 --> 02:05:01.34 Really.
02:05:01.34 --> 02:05:05.74 And it's not the kind of like, like, I don't want to say useless because I don't want
02:05:05.74 --> 02:05:10.34 to like put, put that kind of stigma on other types of supplements.
02:05:10.34 --> 02:05:16.10 But it's like a whole system to stay very solidly like on the path.
02:05:16.10 --> 02:05:17.10 And then you get on them.
02:05:17.10 --> 02:05:19.34 We know we're kind of in squat season apparently.
02:05:19.34 --> 02:05:24.18 But then you can be in squat season, which means you might want to get on board the
02:05:24.18 --> 02:05:25.18 malt train.
02:05:25.18 --> 02:05:26.18 Yes, sir.
02:05:26.18 --> 02:05:29.86 Because you're going to need to he build from your activities.
02:05:29.86 --> 02:05:30.86 Oh, yeah.
02:05:30.86 --> 02:05:31.86 It's got activities.
02:05:31.86 --> 02:05:35.58 So I, Scott, Scott, to this area.
02:05:35.58 --> 02:05:38.46 I, two stakes the other day.
02:05:38.46 --> 02:05:39.46 Concurrently like why?
02:05:39.46 --> 02:05:42.98 Yeah, in one mirror, in one meal, just takes brown rice.
02:05:42.98 --> 02:05:45.42 Because why would you just have one big stake?
02:05:45.42 --> 02:05:47.70 Well, they were two medium stakes.
02:05:47.70 --> 02:05:48.70 Okay.
02:05:48.70 --> 02:05:49.70 I don't know.
02:05:49.70 --> 02:05:50.70 That's the size you buy at the store.
02:05:50.70 --> 02:05:51.70 Oh, yeah.
02:05:51.70 --> 02:05:52.70 Oh, yeah.
02:05:52.70 --> 02:05:58.18 I mean, maybe I could have went to the body, but you know, and I, that didn't happen.
02:05:58.18 --> 02:06:00.14 How many ounces were you thinking?
02:06:00.14 --> 02:06:01.14 What's the medium regular one?
02:06:01.14 --> 02:06:03.62 You know, I have the thin one, the revised, right?
02:06:03.62 --> 02:06:04.62 You have the thin, the buys.
02:06:04.62 --> 02:06:07.90 And you have the super those super fat ones that you get from the guy behind the counter.
02:06:07.90 --> 02:06:09.74 And then you have the regular medium ones.
02:06:09.74 --> 02:06:10.74 Okay.
02:06:10.74 --> 02:06:11.74 Yeah, two of those.
02:06:11.74 --> 02:06:12.74 Two of the mediums.
02:06:12.74 --> 02:06:13.74 Which was a lot.
02:06:13.74 --> 02:06:15.38 Normally, it just happened.
02:06:15.38 --> 02:06:16.38 Oh, my cool.
02:06:16.38 --> 02:06:17.98 I needed some additional protein.
02:06:17.98 --> 02:06:19.38 That's why came home late.
02:06:19.38 --> 02:06:20.38 Didn't eat all day.
02:06:20.38 --> 02:06:22.82 I was only having one meal, so I needed to double up on the protein.
02:06:22.82 --> 02:06:23.82 Had to.
02:06:23.82 --> 02:06:24.82 Hmm.
02:06:24.82 --> 02:06:25.82 Some same brown rice.
02:06:25.82 --> 02:06:27.42 But can't be doing that every day.
02:06:27.42 --> 02:06:28.42 Some same.
02:06:28.42 --> 02:06:29.66 I'm just saying it's not convenient.
02:06:29.66 --> 02:06:31.78 And also, let's face it when you get done.
02:06:31.78 --> 02:06:34.30 You still, these eye.
02:06:34.30 --> 02:06:36.94 Even with the most dose rib eyes.
02:06:36.94 --> 02:06:37.94 Yeah.
02:06:37.94 --> 02:06:39.38 I can still get done with two rib eyes.
02:06:39.38 --> 02:06:40.38 Marbled tasty.
02:06:40.38 --> 02:06:41.38 Good.
02:06:41.38 --> 02:06:42.38 Good.
02:06:42.38 --> 02:06:43.38 Good.
02:06:43.38 --> 02:06:44.38 Yeah.
02:06:44.38 --> 02:06:47.98 I can still get done and want to have dessert.
02:06:47.98 --> 02:06:48.98 What?
02:06:48.98 --> 02:06:51.26 Now, what am I going to have for dessert?
02:06:51.26 --> 02:06:55.98 Could I have something that is negates my physical progress?
02:06:55.98 --> 02:06:56.98 I could.
02:06:56.98 --> 02:06:58.38 Or I could just have milk.
02:06:58.38 --> 02:06:59.38 Yeah.
02:06:59.38 --> 02:07:00.98 That's one more step forward, you mean?
02:07:00.98 --> 02:07:01.98 Oh, man.
02:07:01.98 --> 02:07:02.98 So good.
02:07:02.98 --> 02:07:04.98 Once it hits the lips, bro.
02:07:04.98 --> 02:07:06.98 It's so good.
02:07:06.98 --> 02:07:09.38 Thank you, Joko, for the lips.
02:07:09.38 --> 02:07:10.38 Thing.

02:07:23.02 --> 02:07:24.02 It's cool.
02:07:24.02 --> 02:07:25.02 Yeah.
02:07:25.02 --> 02:07:26.02 He's talking about beer.
02:07:26.02 --> 02:07:27.02 Like a beer funnel.
02:07:27.02 --> 02:07:28.02 What is it called?
02:07:28.02 --> 02:07:29.02 The beer funnel.
02:07:29.02 --> 02:07:30.02 Beer.

02:07:35.02 --> 02:07:36.02 He's so good.
02:07:36.02 --> 02:07:38.02 Once it hits the lips, it's kind of like milk.
02:07:38.02 --> 02:07:39.02 It's the same feeling.
02:07:39.02 --> 02:07:40.02 It's so good.
02:07:40.02 --> 02:07:42.02 Once it hits the lips, you just, yes, or.
02:07:42.02 --> 02:07:43.02 Same thing.
02:07:43.02 --> 02:07:44.02 I understand, fully.
02:07:44.02 --> 02:07:45.02 But I think that's the new thing.
02:07:45.02 --> 02:07:48.02 Get a grass fed, bison, rib, by smaller.
02:07:48.02 --> 02:07:50.02 But, bro, it's kind of a dream.
02:07:50.02 --> 02:07:53.82 Well, actually, the thing, you know, over at other people's houses right now is actually
02:07:53.82 --> 02:07:54.82 milk.
02:07:54.82 --> 02:07:55.82 All right.
02:07:55.82 --> 02:07:56.82 That's right.
02:07:56.82 --> 02:07:57.82 Yeah, that's right.
02:07:57.82 --> 02:07:58.82 Yeah, that's good.
02:07:58.82 --> 02:07:59.82 Yeah, that's good.
02:07:59.82 --> 02:08:00.82 Yeah, that's good.
02:08:00.82 --> 02:08:01.82 Yeah, that's good.
02:08:01.82 --> 02:08:05.58 Out there, just, you know, you know, exactly where it came from.
02:08:05.58 --> 02:08:06.58 Just elk in and up.
02:08:06.58 --> 02:08:07.58 Yep.
02:08:07.58 --> 02:08:08.58 Good.
02:08:08.58 --> 02:08:09.58 We're there at the moment of truth.
02:08:09.58 --> 02:08:10.58 Yeah.
02:08:10.58 --> 02:08:11.58 Did it?
02:08:11.58 --> 02:08:12.58 Good.
02:08:12.58 --> 02:08:18.86 So, in the event of you not having elk in your freezer, in the case, maybe from your
02:08:18.86 --> 02:08:25.82 hunt, as the case, maybe or double rib eyes at any given moment or bison steak.
02:08:25.82 --> 02:08:26.82 Right.
02:08:26.82 --> 02:08:27.82 You want some additional protein?
02:08:27.82 --> 02:08:28.82 Mulk chain all day.

02:08:50.10 --> 02:08:51.70 I didn't really know what a hogey was.

02:09:02.26 --> 02:09:03.26 Where I'm from grinder.
02:09:03.26 --> 02:09:05.70 If you heard that before, it's not.
02:09:05.70 --> 02:09:06.70 It's not.
02:09:06.70 --> 02:09:09.90 My wife, who's from England, would call it a back.
02:09:09.90 --> 02:09:10.90 AP.
02:09:10.90 --> 02:09:11.90 That's not true.
02:09:11.90 --> 02:09:12.90 That's true.
02:09:12.90 --> 02:09:13.90 That's true.
02:09:13.90 --> 02:09:14.90 There's some other ones I think were missing.
02:09:14.90 --> 02:09:15.90 Oh, poor boy, poor boy.
02:09:15.90 --> 02:09:16.90 Poor boy.
02:09:16.90 --> 02:09:17.90 Poor boy.
02:09:17.90 --> 02:09:18.90 That's another one.
02:09:18.90 --> 02:09:20.90 So there's some names out there.
02:09:20.90 --> 02:09:21.90 Yeah, all day.
02:09:21.90 --> 02:09:22.90 Meanwhile.
02:09:22.90 --> 02:09:24.90 Also, also, origin USA.
02:09:24.90 --> 02:09:25.90 This is American-made stuff.
02:09:25.90 --> 02:09:28.58 Look, you get, look, our health is together.
02:09:28.58 --> 02:09:29.58 We know that, Erie.
02:09:29.58 --> 02:09:30.58 We're standing in the path.
02:09:30.58 --> 02:09:31.58 It's not.
02:09:31.58 --> 02:09:32.58 Don't complicit on the path.
02:09:32.58 --> 02:09:33.58 Right?
02:09:33.58 --> 02:09:34.58 Yeah.
02:09:34.58 --> 02:09:35.58 Look.
02:09:35.58 --> 02:09:36.58 You want it as far as a parallel goes.
02:09:36.58 --> 02:09:37.58 We all wear clothes.
02:09:37.58 --> 02:09:38.58 Hopefully.
02:09:38.58 --> 02:09:39.58 Well, maybe we wear clothes.
02:09:39.58 --> 02:09:40.58 Yeah.
02:09:40.58 --> 02:09:51.98 We want some iconic American-made attire denim jeans, boots, some shirts, some other leather
02:09:51.98 --> 02:09:54.38 garalettes, belts, this kind of stuff.
02:09:54.38 --> 02:09:56.26 What if it was all made in America?
02:09:56.26 --> 02:09:57.26 Oh, it is.
02:09:57.26 --> 02:09:58.26 What is it?
02:09:58.26 --> 02:10:00.26 By the way, but you want that bison steak?
02:10:00.26 --> 02:10:01.26 Cool.
02:10:01.26 --> 02:10:02.26 How about that bison boots?
02:10:02.26 --> 02:10:03.26 Oh, yeah.
02:10:03.26 --> 02:10:04.26 Made in America.
02:10:04.26 --> 02:10:05.26 A couple leather.
02:10:05.26 --> 02:10:07.26 We were able to use the terms, so I'll go.
02:10:07.26 --> 02:10:10.26 I think I did one time and I was very uncomfortable.
02:10:10.26 --> 02:10:11.26 Yeah.
02:10:11.26 --> 02:10:15.02 I'm going to use it again right now, describing some bison boots, which are supple.
02:10:15.02 --> 02:10:16.02 All right.
02:10:16.02 --> 02:10:17.02 There you go.
02:10:17.02 --> 02:10:18.02 You heard it here.
02:10:18.02 --> 02:10:19.02 Look, go.
02:10:19.02 --> 02:10:22.62 But yes, but everything made in America from the materials, the raw materials, grown
02:10:22.62 --> 02:10:23.62 in America.
02:10:23.62 --> 02:10:27.18 Everything all the way up to the jeans you wearing on your hips.
02:10:27.18 --> 02:10:29.50 And so you're good 24 hours a day.
02:10:29.50 --> 02:10:33.02 Because you got also, because we're training to jitter, you got your jitter geek.
02:10:33.02 --> 02:10:34.02 You got to rift geeks.
02:10:34.02 --> 02:10:36.38 You're never going to get another kind of geek in.
02:10:36.38 --> 02:10:37.38 Oh, yeah.
02:10:37.38 --> 02:10:39.02 So the whole system is accounted for.
02:10:39.02 --> 02:10:40.02 Yeah.
02:10:40.02 --> 02:10:41.02 So the first thing I did was do the game.
02:10:41.02 --> 02:10:42.02 It's true.
02:10:42.02 --> 02:10:48.06 Or junior say dot com also, jitter, so now you want to go into straight up representing
02:10:48.06 --> 02:10:53.18 on the path like a choice, a contrast choice to represent.
02:10:53.18 --> 02:10:58.90 Is there a psychological hit that you get when you were a little kid?
02:10:58.90 --> 02:10:59.90 You got new sneakers.
02:10:59.90 --> 02:11:00.90 Yes, sir.
02:11:00.90 --> 02:11:01.90 We're running a little bit faster.
02:11:01.90 --> 02:11:02.90 Yes, sir.
02:11:02.90 --> 02:11:03.90 We're on the path.
02:11:03.90 --> 02:11:07.02 We put on a freaking t-shirt that says, dear spleen equals freedom.
02:11:07.02 --> 02:11:09.38 Do we go a little bit harder in the pain?
02:11:09.38 --> 02:11:09.98 Yes, we do.
02:11:09.98 --> 02:11:12.94 So there's a thing that sounds like, oh, that's kind of like funny.
02:11:12.94 --> 02:11:13.94 You're right.
02:11:13.94 --> 02:11:14.94 It's absolutely true.
02:11:14.94 --> 02:11:16.74 And here's the thing, do an experiment.
02:11:16.74 --> 02:11:17.74 The science.
02:11:17.74 --> 02:11:19.74 Where's the wear?
02:11:19.74 --> 02:11:22.46 A shirt or a hoodie or whatever says this will equals freedom.
02:11:22.46 --> 02:11:23.70 Look in the mirror and eat a cookie.
02:11:23.70 --> 02:11:26.02 See how I'm not saying not going to be able to eat the cookies.
02:11:26.02 --> 02:11:27.02 I'm not saying that.
02:11:27.02 --> 02:11:29.34 It's going to be a hard way harder.
02:11:29.34 --> 02:11:30.34 Yes.
02:11:30.34 --> 02:11:31.34 Oh, yeah.
02:11:31.34 --> 02:11:34.34 So now if you're just in your everyday life, but you're representing.
02:11:34.34 --> 02:11:38.14 But the chances of you flipping off the path, even for that moment.
02:11:38.14 --> 02:11:40.98 I actually feel bad we haven't put this word out before.
02:11:40.98 --> 02:11:41.98 Because this is important.
02:11:41.98 --> 02:11:43.38 It's like the same.
02:11:43.38 --> 02:11:44.78 It's kind of important.
02:11:44.78 --> 02:11:45.78 It is.
02:11:45.78 --> 02:11:46.78 Yes, sir.
02:11:46.78 --> 02:11:47.78 It's true.
02:11:47.78 --> 02:11:51.06 It just sort of applies like if you're just representing the general in general,
02:11:51.06 --> 02:11:53.50 it's just that much more efficient way of staying on the path.
02:11:53.50 --> 02:11:54.86 So I'm saying, and let's face it.
02:11:54.86 --> 02:11:57.46 You see somebody else representing your representing this.
02:11:57.46 --> 02:11:58.46 The collegian.
02:11:58.46 --> 02:11:59.46 Right.
02:11:59.46 --> 02:12:01.06 Now we're even stronger together together.
02:12:01.06 --> 02:12:03.58 Also, the shirt locker.
02:12:03.58 --> 02:12:04.98 This is a part of Jocco's store.
02:12:04.98 --> 02:12:05.98 It's a part.
02:12:05.98 --> 02:12:09.94 Choose the sign up for shirt locker. You're going to new shirt every month with.
02:12:09.94 --> 02:12:10.94 Did you change the word?
02:12:10.94 --> 02:12:11.94 Creative designs.
02:12:11.94 --> 02:12:12.94 You said something.
02:12:12.94 --> 02:12:16.34 Well, now there's actually bad ass because the new one that just came out is.
02:12:16.34 --> 02:12:17.82 And it's new.
02:12:17.82 --> 02:12:20.82 It's like a new scenario.
02:12:20.82 --> 02:12:22.62 It's a tank.
02:12:22.62 --> 02:12:26.50 There's kettlebells flying off, which I noticed.
02:12:26.50 --> 02:12:27.62 You did run into the kettlebells.
02:12:27.62 --> 02:12:30.14 There's kettlebells flying through the air.
02:12:30.14 --> 02:12:33.42 I'm riding this tank sort of in a aggressive hospital kind of way.
02:12:33.42 --> 02:12:34.42 We're in a deaf court.
02:12:34.42 --> 02:12:35.66 We're in a deaf court.
02:12:35.66 --> 02:12:36.66 Which I'm wearing right now.
02:12:36.66 --> 02:12:39.38 By the way, maybe I just dismounted my tank and showed up here to tell you his
02:12:39.38 --> 02:12:40.38 forecast.
02:12:40.38 --> 02:12:41.38 Two machine guns.
02:12:41.38 --> 02:12:42.38 Two machine guns.
02:12:42.38 --> 02:12:45.86 And the tank is an M1 Abrams tank.
02:12:45.86 --> 02:12:46.86 By the way.
02:12:46.86 --> 02:12:49.06 So you have a good depiction.
02:12:49.06 --> 02:12:51.38 When it looks like a comic book thing, that's what made it because kind of a
02:12:51.38 --> 02:12:52.38 dope thing.
02:12:52.38 --> 02:12:53.38 Yeah.
02:12:53.38 --> 02:12:55.86 I commend your work there.
02:12:55.86 --> 02:12:56.86 Commended.
02:12:56.86 --> 02:13:02.54 The bad news is that was last month's shirt.
02:13:02.54 --> 02:13:04.98 Like this past month's shirt.
02:13:04.98 --> 02:13:07.70 The good news is when you're signed up as short, long as I don't care if you
02:13:07.70 --> 02:13:10.50 sign up next year, you can still get that shirt if you want.
02:13:10.50 --> 02:13:11.82 If access to that shirt.
02:13:11.82 --> 02:13:12.82 If you signed up.
02:13:12.82 --> 02:13:15.06 So, boom, nowhere is anyway.
02:13:15.06 --> 02:13:16.06 Yeah.
02:13:16.06 --> 02:13:17.06 Jockels.com.
02:13:17.06 --> 02:13:18.06 You want to represent.
02:13:18.06 --> 02:13:19.06 Boom.
02:13:19.06 --> 02:13:20.06 That's where you can get the stuff to represent.
02:13:20.06 --> 02:13:22.06 Speaking of subscription.
02:13:22.06 --> 02:13:23.06 Subscribe to this podcast.
02:13:23.06 --> 02:13:25.74 Don't forget about unravelling podcasts, grounded podcast.
02:13:25.74 --> 02:13:26.74 War your kid podcast.
02:13:26.74 --> 02:13:31.30 I got to ask by kids at Jockel Live, which by the way is Jockel Live in Austin.
02:13:31.30 --> 02:13:37.30 Coming up Saturday night, Austin, Texas, November 20th.
02:13:37.30 --> 02:13:42.78 So, we're going to come to that and ask me questions or hang out or listen to me talk.
02:13:42.78 --> 02:13:45.06 Come check that out, but also where you're kid podcast.
02:13:45.06 --> 02:13:50.90 We also have Jockel on the ground, which again, we have contingency plans.
02:13:50.90 --> 02:13:55.18 We will recently, we will recently shadow ban.
02:13:55.18 --> 02:13:56.18 Shadow ban.
02:13:56.18 --> 02:13:58.62 Yeah, forgot Shadow ban.
02:13:58.62 --> 02:14:00.50 On Instagram.
02:14:00.50 --> 02:14:01.82 We know people going to why.
02:14:01.82 --> 02:14:02.82 Why do you get shadow ban?
02:14:02.82 --> 02:14:03.82 That's the problem.
02:14:03.82 --> 02:14:04.82 We don't know why.
02:14:04.82 --> 02:14:06.46 We have some suspicions.
02:14:06.46 --> 02:14:09.06 We're going to talk about it on the underground.
02:14:09.06 --> 02:14:13.26 I'm going to explain the reasons why I think the Shadow ban might have come.
02:14:13.26 --> 02:14:15.94 I've been on Shadow ban now apparently.
02:14:15.94 --> 02:14:19.34 We have information.
02:14:19.34 --> 02:14:20.34 We do have information.
02:14:20.34 --> 02:14:24.50 We've got troopers in, let's just say, we have a place.
02:14:24.50 --> 02:14:27.10 Something we call access in placement.
02:14:27.10 --> 02:14:28.70 We have people.
02:14:28.70 --> 02:14:31.90 So we will hopefully not let that happen again.
02:14:31.90 --> 02:14:34.14 But look, it can happen.
02:14:34.14 --> 02:14:40.78 And that's where we made Jockel on the ground in case mayhem happens in case we get locked
02:14:40.78 --> 02:14:41.62 down.
02:14:41.62 --> 02:14:44.14 We don't control these platforms that you're listening to this on.
02:14:44.14 --> 02:14:45.62 We do control Jockel on the ground.
02:14:45.62 --> 02:14:51.82 If you want to help support us, it costs $8.18 a month because we appreciate that support
02:14:51.82 --> 02:14:53.82 to have that contingency plan set up.
02:14:53.82 --> 02:14:55.46 We make an extra podcast.
02:14:55.46 --> 02:14:56.14 Jockel on the ground.
02:14:56.14 --> 02:14:57.98 We talk about other subjects.
02:14:57.98 --> 02:14:58.98 We talk about Jockel on the ground.
02:14:58.98 --> 02:15:15.34 If you can't afford it, we still want, we're still, you're still with us.
02:15:15.34 --> 02:15:17.10 You can't afford that $8.18 a month.
02:15:17.10 --> 02:15:19.14 Just email assistance at Jockel on the ground.com.
02:15:19.14 --> 02:15:20.62 We'll get you access to it.
02:15:20.62 --> 02:15:23.22 We have a YouTube channel.
02:15:23.22 --> 02:15:24.22 You can subscribe to that.
02:15:24.22 --> 02:15:27.78 Or you're subscribed to the origin, USA, YouTube channel for some behind the scenes.
02:15:27.78 --> 02:15:30.34 We got an album called Psychological Warfare.
02:15:30.34 --> 02:15:35.46 If you need a little help in a moment of weakness.
02:15:35.46 --> 02:15:39.54 And look, we could make an album where you have a moment of weakness and we pre-press
02:15:39.54 --> 02:15:41.26 of the track.
02:15:41.26 --> 02:15:47.78 And it's echo talking about Rubik's Cube for 15 minutes with no logical meaning behind it.
02:15:47.78 --> 02:15:48.78 That part's incorrect.
02:15:48.78 --> 02:15:49.78 Very much logic.
02:15:49.78 --> 02:15:50.78 Yes.
02:15:50.78 --> 02:15:51.78 But we did.
02:15:51.78 --> 02:15:52.78 We didn't do that.
02:15:52.78 --> 02:15:53.78 Maybe we'll do that.
02:15:53.78 --> 02:15:58.02 People that have more time to overcome their weakness.
02:15:58.02 --> 02:15:59.90 But if you want to get that, go to wherever you get M.P.
02:15:59.90 --> 02:16:01.98 Threes, you can get Psychological Warfare.
02:16:01.98 --> 02:16:03.34 I am the artist.
02:16:03.34 --> 02:16:04.34 Yeah.
02:16:04.34 --> 02:16:05.90 Because this is artist's name.

02:16:07.90 --> 02:16:08.90 Yeah.
02:16:08.90 --> 02:16:09.90 So there you go.

02:16:10.90 --> 02:16:13.62 Dakota Meyer making just awesome stuff.
02:16:13.62 --> 02:16:17.66 He started a distribution company, by the way, is not in Texas.
02:16:17.66 --> 02:16:20.78 I'm investing in his beverage distribution company.
02:16:20.78 --> 02:16:26.02 He started going out proactively delivering Jockel Goal to various stories.
02:16:26.02 --> 02:16:27.82 And now he's got people ordering it.
02:16:27.82 --> 02:16:30.50 Brother, that's an anti-authoritarian is sick.
02:16:30.50 --> 02:16:33.78 My head's freaking Dakota Meyer doing the M.P.

02:16:38.02 --> 02:16:39.02 Cool.
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:40.02 I just outmaneuvered them.
02:16:40.02 --> 02:16:43.02 Oh, there's some distribution company that didn't want to make the connection.
02:16:43.02 --> 02:16:44.02 Oh, cool.
02:16:44.02 --> 02:16:45.90 Dakota Meyer is just in a truck.

02:17:12.34 --> 02:17:17.10 We know that it brings tears to J.P. to NL, to NL crying in the play.

02:17:36.34 --> 02:17:40.70 and you don't, you are, you're not a good person.
02:17:40.70 --> 02:17:42.50 You're not a good person.
02:17:42.50 --> 02:17:46.46 If you know a kid and you don't get them those books, you're not, you're hurting those
02:17:46.46 --> 02:17:47.46 kids.
02:17:47.46 --> 02:17:49.98 This is factual.
02:17:49.98 --> 02:17:54.46 So whatever, I know I've met some really cool people lately.
02:17:54.46 --> 02:17:58.58 I met someone down at the master, GJ2, GJ2 player.

02:20:36.86 --> 02:20:45.30 And everyone else out there may be asking yourself that question if you are possibly incompetent.
02:20:45.30 --> 02:20:48.70 And I hope you're not.
02:20:48.70 --> 02:20:50.74 But how do you avoid being incompetent?
02:20:50.74 --> 02:20:54.46 Number one lesson from this book is something that we talk about all the time.
02:20:54.46 --> 02:20:55.90 Be humble, listen.
02:20:55.90 --> 02:21:03.42 Don't think you know everything because you don't.
02:21:03.42 --> 02:21:04.42 Be humble.
02:21:04.42 --> 02:21:05.98 Keep an open mind.
02:21:05.98 --> 02:21:15.58 The thing that traps your mind, the thing that traps your mind is your mind.
02:21:15.58 --> 02:21:21.54 So pry it open, keep it open and go get after it.
02:21:21.54 --> 02:21:36.98 Until next time, Zekko and Jockel.
