00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocco podcast number 241 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000 I was the number one man on the door in my train, which meant I would be the first man into the room.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:31.000 Mission's often included debates as to who would get to go first. All these guys were fearless and like to train hop to the front of the stack the most dangerous place to be first into a room.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.000 Seals love to fight. We all want to be the first into the fight, and every seal is willing to accept the greater risk, especially for his buddy's sake.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000 I had no apprehension about the possibility of my own death. My concern was for my platoon mates.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000 While I can't speak for everyone, their actions this night prove they all felt the same way.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000 Clarky and I looked at each other. He smiled back at me.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000 We had practiced this maneuver a thousand times, and it successfully done it on hundreds of missions just like this one.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000 There was no rush of adrenaline or anxiety.
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 We were composed, relaxed, and professional.
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000 We would simultaneously breach our respective doors and go to work, clearing the rooms of enemy fighters and other potential threats.
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000 We launched on the signal, a mutual wave of our rifle barrels.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000 I breached the door to my room. It's swung open to the right.
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000 I followed the door in as it opened, looked down the right wall, and saw it was clear.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000 As I pivoted off my right foot to move down the left wall, I had the sensation that my body was being slammed with a dozen sledjammers.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000 My entire body was now in the room, and the men behind me in my room clearing train were attempting to follow me in.
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000 The room was small, 12 feet by 12 feet.
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000 My night vision goggles illuminated the darkness, and I saw in clear view four of our targets aiming at me.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000 All of them armed with automatic weapons, and all of them firing at me.
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000 That right there is an excerpt from a book called Perfectly Wounded by a retired seal named Mike Day.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000 And I knew Mike when he was a young seal. He was maybe ten classes ahead of me going through basic seal training.
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000 He started his career at seal team three. I started my seal career next door.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000 I don't know, 50 meters away, 100 meters away over at seal team one.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000 We crossed paths on what was my first deployment.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000 We'd see each other around from time to time.
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000 He was always very cool to me from what I could tell always cool to everyone, nice guy.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000 No ego, no attitude.
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:36.000 And on the day that Mike writes about in that book, those insurgents that were shooting at him, they hit their mark.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:49.000 And not just once, not just twice, not just three or four or five or ten times, but 27 times.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000 27 times, Mike was shot 11 times in his body armor and 16 times in his body.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:21.000 And you have to keep in mind, and this is a strange thing, but one single round or one single tiny piece of fragmentation can kill you.
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:39.000 So to receive that many shots and survive is, well, it's some kind of miracle.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000 And then to go beyond that, because the story doesn't end there, but to receive that many shots and actually fight back is beyond a miracle.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000 And that's exactly what Mike did.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000 He fought back and he won.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.000 And it is an honor to have Mike here today to tell us about his experiences, his life and his lessons learned.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000 He's got a bunch of them.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000 So Mike, thanks for coming on, man.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000 I appreciate you guys having me.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000 Yeah, getting you out here, I know we're in the middle of middle of COVID right now.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000 You've been driving across country.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000 I know you just got done with a total of all tree challenge up and up and Utah.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000 I wish I could have grabbed you there, so you'd have to come all the way down here, but now you're telling me you're going to try and look to serve a little bit, which is awesome.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 Well, I'm trying to, that looks like this serves going to be picking up in Virginia since I'm not there.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000 You got to hurricane coming up the gas the way it works, isn't it?
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000 You should have been yesterday.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000 Well, hey, man, I want to jump into this. Your book is first of all, it's just, I mean, everyone, obviously I'm not going to read the whole book. I'm going to read some of it.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000 Just go and go and get the book right now.
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000 The detail that Mike goes into, this is a historical document about being in the SEAL teams, about being in combat.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:37.000 And then what's in addition to that, the life stories that you bring to the table are important for people to understand, understand what, how people grow up in different situations, what it does to them, and how to get through those hard situations, because you definitely went through some hard situations.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000 So I'm going to jump into it, man.
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000 Jump into this book and kind of talk about your past and how you grow up, and it starts off like this. He looked huge like a damn monster.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000 She was screaming and fighting back, which only made it worse.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000 I was frozen in terror. He bent her arm over his knee and like a twig cracked it.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:18.000 I watched him break her arm. He yelled at me, go get me a glass of water. I ran to the kitchen, filled a glass and ran back to hand it to him. He drank it, then smashed the glass on a nearby table and held the broken shard like a knife.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000 He went after her again with this newly created blade. I jumped on his back to stop him.
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000 I think that's what finally snapped him out of his uncontrolled rage. I flew off him as he swung his arm and landed on the ground on my back.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000 He spun around to attack his unknown aggressor and realized it was me.
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000 I clearly remember seeing his expression dissolved from rage into one of guilt and shame.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000 This is my earliest memory and my first encounter with a terrorist. It was 1976 in New Jersey and the terrorist was my father.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000 His victim was my mother.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000 I was five years old.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000 That's your earliest memory.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000 The shielding is very easy. He made it easy.
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000 This is, I believe, pretty prevalent in our society now. A lot of us have just terrible parents.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:42.000 One of the best books I've ever read is the Body Keeps Score. He says, in that book, the largest medical issue, the largest medical problem we have in this country, is childhood trauma.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000 Because you learn what you are in the first seven years.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:58.000 For me, luckily it wasn't to the point where I became more of a victim and worried about what things were going to happen.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000 My response was just to fight. So when I get scared or angry now, I fight when I get scared.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000 A lot of people want to get scared. The fight or fight is to coward.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000 You can see in a lot of gun fights with people that aren't trained.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000 One of the most prominent places to get shot.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000 Somebody that doesn't know what they're doing.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000 And they're forearms in their hands.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000 Because they're calorie.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000 And our, when we get triggered, people know that you don't jump around a corner.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000 Discarving me because I'm going to smack you. So I had to head. That's my response. I don't flinch. My response is to go forward.
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000 And, you know, my father ingrained that in me.
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000 And then I got in the seal teams. That was ingrained in me.
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000 And that night and that gun fight, there was no thoughts. That was all reaction. That was all muscle memory.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000 I was terrified. I went through a terrified a little bit of terrified terrification. That's a new word.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 And once I got past that, it was just angry.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000 And then everything was automatic.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000 You go on.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000 You go on here in the book.
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000 My parents divorced not long after my father broke my mother's arm.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000 My mother would soon start dating and eventually marry Tom.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000 A black man, a rare union in the 1970s.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000 My father held racist beliefs and my mother's marriage to a black man and flamed my father's racist sentiment.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000 The divorce included a custody hearing.
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000 I was young, but I can distinctly recall someone in court, a lawyer, possibly the judge, asking me strange questions about Tom.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000 Like, have you ever seen Tom naked? Have you ever seen Tom and your mother sleeping together?
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000 The focus of the custody battle, which should have been my father and his treatment of us, was instead trained on me, an innocent bystandard.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000 Interracial relationships were not the social norm in the 1970s.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000 I'm sure the court knew my father beat my mother and us kids, but they still awarded him full custody regardless.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000 My hunch is that the courts were so biased at the time that they decided my younger brother and I would be better off with a wife,
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000 Peter, an abusive father than be raised by an interracial couple.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000 I'll speculation, but I mean, the 70s were not like that.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000 Yeah, where was this?
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000 This was New Jersey.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000 Still New Jersey.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000 And they still married and I got two brothers, one's in the Coast Guard from that marriage.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000 And he's a rescue sorter.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000 Oh, not a rescue. He's a crew chief on the birds that go out and carry the rescue swervers.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000 So how old are you at this point? You must've been six years old or something like that?
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000 Yeah, I've already about that. I'm thinking, you know, when I picture you, I don't picture the old bastard that I seen in front of me right now.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000 I picture this young kid.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000 I'm like, I'm like blonde hair and you know, blue eyes.
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000 Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's the, when I open, I was like, oh, yeah, I know this guy.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000 I'm not this one.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.000 Yeah.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000 So I'm sure you're looking to be thinking the same thing. You know, my dad was driving around his house.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000 We haven't changed that much really.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.000 If I shave this.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000 Yeah, yeah, no, you don't look that much different except for you used to have the freaking, the blonde blocks.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000 Bright blonde blocks.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000 No, and I'm thinking, you know, there you are in court. This little Aryan kid.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000 And the judges are looking at, you know, the the interracial couple.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000 And like you said, I mean, you said it's a, what you said, it's an assumption.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000 But to think of any other reason why they would decide to send you with a known child abuser is it's hard to come up with a different reason.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000 Well, that's another reason why this books really good. I don't think anybody be able to pick that up. Nobody gets to this life without trauma.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000 And it's, it's a lot more prevalent than I think we understand child abuse and
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000 Jesus, look at the child trafficking going on right now.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000 I mean, there's just some really bad parents really bad people out there and people are going to suffer trauma.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000 You got to build the resiliency. It's training.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000 They, they help us build the resiliency. We required to do what we did in the seal teams.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000 And it's just training. If you sit on the couch and you twinkies all day and watch and watch TV.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000 Anytime something other than that comes up that causes stress. You're just not going to be able to handle it. You got to train to be able to handle stress.
00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:08.000 And then I mean, that sounds awesome. That sounds awesome. But the reality is, I mean, you're probably this small percentage of people that can get out of a situation like this and move in a positive direction.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000 I don't know what the percentage is, but obviously there's some percentage of people that go through these traumatic experiences kids and they end up, you know, they end up in jail on drugs and whatever else.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:29.000 And yeah, I mean, there's something along the way that made you there's not a whole lot of difference between me and 80% of the prisoners here in California.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000 I just had the proper opportunity at the right time.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Because if I didn't join the Navy, I might. I, I beat Ronald and MS 13. I think I have to go after you.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:15:03.000 I think I'm after me. I, the, the amount of seals and this sounds freaking horrible to say, look, there's some guys that are saints and the seal teams for sure, but the amount of guys and the seal teams just if you just took a broad cut of the seal mentality, there is an element of criminal mentality in there.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000 Like, oh, if you, if you want to join the Navy, we know where this is going to end up for sure.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:29.000 Well, we have to deal with criminals. Yes. I mean, a lot of people think that when we go to war, I'd venture to say that 75% of the people that we're dealing with are not ISIS or al Qaeda, they're just the criminal element that are profit, profitiers off of off of the current.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:40.000 I mean, look what we've got going on with whatever the missions going on. They, they, they, they, they logically, they don't care. There is, okay, I can make some money off of that.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000 You know, you look at religion in this country. You know, got how many Christians and then what level are they practicing? You know, it's the same thing with Muslims.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000 Yeah, they're Muslim, but are they really practicing? Are they really going to follow what they think is right? Or are they going to take the path of least resistance, which is what humans will do?
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:15.000 You, you continue on here and fast forward a little bit. My father was a sailor. When the Navy issued him new orders, we moved to Pennsylvania from New Jersey after the divorce. My father remarried.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000 Our new stepmother soon became pregnant, giving birth to my first half sister two years later. She gave birth to my half brother trauma attracts trauma.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000 It has its own distinct language and behaviors. We would be raised by two people who've been severely traumatized as children.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:45.000 My new stepmother was a natural fit for our family. She too had a history of childhood abuse both physical and mental. I don't know much about her the early years of her life other than her parents would lock her in a closet for long periods of time.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:58.000 She was put up for adoption and taken in by loving couple. My stepmother would grow up to be both victim and perpetrator. She would alternate between coercing my father to beat us and slapping us around herself.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000 She and my father would get into their own fights too. She would fight back even though she had no way of winning. He was six foot two and weighed 240 pounds.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000 One of the worst beatings I ever endured was when I was eight. My brother and I had gone out on a winter day and tell the car was snowballs. The driver was pissed.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000 But if he'd known the price we'd about to pay for our transgressions, he may have given us a pass. We ran to our house with a driver the car chasing us. He knocked on our front door and told my parents what we had done.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000 My father and stepmother had a friend over at the time. They were all drinking. My parents were outraged.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000 Our father sent us to the basement and ad hoc torture chamber of sorts where he made a strip naked before tying our hands to a pole so we were facing each other.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000 He whipped us with his belt so hard after another 15 minutes we'd worked up at he'd worked up a sweat.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000 All the while my stepmother and her friends sat on the basement steps,
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000 sipping their booze, urging him to beat us harder and longer.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000 When he was done, my brother and I were both badly bloodied and bruised.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000 My father's violence escalated as we grew. He would smear toothpaste on the nylon belt when he whipped us so we would sting as it cut and bruised us.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000 I'm not sure where he picked up this technique but it worked.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000 His routine was to bring me into the basement and make me drop my pants so that my bear ass was available.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000 He would wind up and rip into my bear backside with that belt holding onto my arm as I twisted in a circle trying to escape.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000 I recall a week that was preface with him telling us, I know that you will be bad kids this week.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000 He beat us bloody and then he went back to work.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000 This was some crazy stuff. He was so Nazi, he said,
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000 As long as he was a lawyer and beat us for no reason whatsoever before he went to work,
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000 we got beat and we went back to bed hardly a typical morning routine for a first grader.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000 My childhood was a real life horror movie I couldn't escape.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000 It was terrible about that.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000 A lot of people have worse.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000 I got out of it. A lot of people don't.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000 Yeah.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000 We're the sends up. You say finally at the age of 12 after years of enduring a drunk and rages and endless beatings I decided to fight back.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000 When I'd found him passed out drunk on the couch,
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000 I knew that he was passed out because the crotch of his blue jeans was dark and from having wet himself.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000 I grabbed a baseball bat and walked back and forth for about five minutes debating my intentions until finally I mustered up my courage.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000 And with an overhead axe swing, I drilled him hard on the chest with the baseball bat.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000 It felt great, totally empowering rush.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000 I didn't kill him, but I sure surprised him because he immediately woke up from his booze and diced black out with a look of total confusion.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000 That quickly turned evil. He looked at the bat in my hands and realized that I was what that was what just bounced out off his chest.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000 I knew by the look in his eyes he was going to kill me.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000 He chased me upstairs to my room where I jumped out of my second story window into a thorny rose bush.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000 I looked up to see my enraged father's stick.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000 His head out only to pull it back in.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000 I could hear his pounding footsteps from outside as he ran downstairs.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000 He was determined to hunt me down, chasing me through the woods around our house in the dark.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000 He couldn't get through the thick underbrush, but I was too terrified to slow down. He never caught me.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000 I spent the night at a neighbor's house in the next day when I returned home.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000 He had forgotten all about it.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000 In 1983, my father was transferred to Miramar near San Diego, California. That's where he totally lost it.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000 He was drinking, causing problems at work.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000 It had been arrested several times for defecating in the aisles of stores.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Some mental health professionals describe this peculiar public display as elimination disorder.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000 It's a behavior that's been identified in several serial killers and manifest out of extreme anger at someone or something.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000 I was 12 years old when my stepmother received word that my father would be medically discharged from the Navy and institutionalized with schizophrenia and a host of other psychiatric conditions.
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000 He would spend the rest of his life in an inpatient facility or an assisted living environment.
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000 My father has since died. He was very sick and really sick.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000 And he did a terrible job as a parent. However, I know now that he did his best.
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000 That he did the best he could. I don't hold any harsh feelings toward him.
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000 He really sucked as a father.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000 So I mean, it's just it's beyond or he had like legitimate serious mental issues.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000 Well, his father was worse than him.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000 He just wasn't the one that was able to break the cycle.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000 I think he tried to.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000 Just ate him up.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000 I mean, his father used to chase his, his brother and his sister around butcher knives and threatening kill him.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000 He never actually threatened the kill us.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000 I mean, with that thought so is there.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000 His father used to actually make that threat.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000 I never, I never met my grandfather.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000 And what was your grandfather already dead or was quite honest, I don't know if they just kept us from him or or he was or he had passed.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000 I met his mother.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:27.000 You know, looking back on that as a kid, it was strange. She was she's broke just the broken broken woman just strange.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000 You know, just not normal.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000 I mean, go over Thanksgiving dinner and everybody's eating Kentucky fried chicken, which I don't complain about it.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000 I mean, you got food, but not going to complain with having food, but it was just.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000 It was not a normal atmosphere.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000 You could just feel that it was weird.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000 I mean, in his sister grew up in a psychiatric ward.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000 She went in when she was really early.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000 Really young. So I don't know what kind of what was done to her.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000 I mean, some serious darkness there.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000 I mean, we got back going on now in the world.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000 It's pretty prevalent. You know, just shitty parents that abused their kids don't have to be parents because they were abused.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000 Really not an excuse.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000 My kids tell me, well, I've got old kids.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000 You know, 20 year old and 29 year old. And they've always told me we wish you would spank us rather than yell at us.
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000 And I was like, it's because you never would spank.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000 You might change your mind if you got a mass.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000 You go on here.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:49.000 I was about 12 or 13 years old and my stepmother became our legal guardian in season. Newfound freedom by dating a guy in a local rock and roll band named Beechie.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000 And hosting parties at our house are home quickly turned into a constant party with its own inhouse band and all the characters that came with it.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000 People strangers would sit around my house all day getting drunk and stoned.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000 I want particular occasion. My stepmother was partying with Beechie and his band of losers when she tried to smack me.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000 I caught her arms spun it behind her back and swept the legs out from under dumping her on her ass.
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000 That episode got me and my brother sent to Maine to live with our maternal grandparents who we hadn't seen in years for that summer.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000 My half siblings were still young at the time.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000 I still remember looking over my shoulder and seeing my half brother lying in his crib and my half sister lying in her bed as I made my way out of the house.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000 I was just a funny thing about trauma because that's the only thing I remember those two.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000 We're not talking about now but it's as if they weren't even in the same house with us.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000 I don't remember when they get in any different treatment.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000 I don't remember that.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000 That's wild.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000 And you were like two or three.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.000 I don't know.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000 What team are you at?
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000 I was a team two.
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000 Was a team one team two team.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000 I'd rather did like eight years at team two from when the one.
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000 Sometime after 2010.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000 What year was gone?
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.000 I got out in 2010.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000 Yeah, I retired in 2010.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000 You just he was in the team for like ten years.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000 That's awesome.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000 But just no memory of them.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000 None at all.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000 That's the only thing I can remember is looking over my shoulder when I was walking out of the house.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000 Now I can tell this is what I think about memories.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000 Like I don't go back to the town where I grew up very often.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000 And so I don't because I don't like fight but when I say very often, I mean for ten years at a time, right?
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000 And I don't see all those people that I kind of grew up with.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000 So I don't fire those.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000 And then the house comes right.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000 I don't fire those memories very often.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000 So they just like fade and I'll go back there and see someone and they're like, Oh, yeah, I remember when you did this.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000 So I remember the memory of that girl and remember this and this thing over here.
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000 And I'm always like, I feel bad because they're telling me vivid stories about my own childhood.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000 And I just don't remember.
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000 I think it's because I just don't didn't fire those.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000 You can read studies on people's memories, especially in stressful situations.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000 And I like I said my my citations and that accurate.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000 I think gave me credit for saving six women and children that were supposedly in the same room.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000 That was in a gunfight with four dudes with automatic weapons.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.000 They'd all be dead.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000 The guy that saw that had looked past one of our guys that had been shot and killed.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000 To see the six women and children in a totally different room didn't even see the guy laying in the doorway.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000 Just saw the six women and children and superimposed them in the room that I was in.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000 And I'll be dead.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000 Hundreds and hundreds of rounds were fired in that room.
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000 And a matter of minutes.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000 So now you had enough to me.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000 That fall my brother and I moved to Maine for Virginia Beach to live with our mother in her second husband Tom.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000 It was only after we arrived that I learned about how my stepmother and father deliberately and systematically tried to alienate me and my brother from our mother.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000 She showed us a box filled with years worth of Christmas and birthday cards.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000 But they cards had been returned without the check she'd written for us.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000 My father and stepmother cast them all and kept them money for themselves.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000 Despite this, I feel the same about my stepmother as I do about my father.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000 She survived my father's violence into the best she could.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000 I don't hold any harsh feelings towards her either.
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000 Tom and my mother never hit us.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000 They were patient.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000 Did their best appearance.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000 Some severely abused young minds.
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000 They were abused and lived in Virginia Beach all along.
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000 But as I would learn everything happens for a reason.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 Never would made it through Buds.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000 I had made it through eighth grade in entered green run high school where I lasted until my junior year.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000 When my resting coach caught me smoking pot in the school bathroom.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000 This caused my exposure.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000 Is that a public school green run?
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000 That's actually a very cool game run.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000 I started to get kicked out of that one.
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000 Shortly after being expelled, I had to run with the police.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000 Comp us me with a bag of weed at the time.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000 Any amount over an ounce was a felony.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000 The cop grabbed the bag and said, is this an ounce?
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000 I said, yes, he opened the bag.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Grabbed a pinch and chucked it onto the street.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000 Then said, is this an ounce now? No, I replied.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000 That cop saved me from a felony charge.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000 I saved my life. I like to find that guy one day and thank him.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000 It was a good cop trying to take care of his freaking knucklehead kid.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000 I was like 14 or 15 years old.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000 So from, so you can't do this.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000 Almost 30 days in jail now.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000 It's very learn how to play, uh, what would it?
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000 Peanuckle.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000 Played out a play bunch of card games.
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000 Oh, man.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000 So then you end up in space.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000 That comes in handy on the on the ships.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000 Once you're in the Navy, um,
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000 you ended up in the job core, which is like, you know, you're doing vocational training.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000 Uh, that doesn't seem to work out to great.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000 1990 or 1980. You got a neighbor retired Navy diver who tells you you're going to end up dead or in jail.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000 If you keep this up, you should join the seal teams instead.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000 They'll pay you to do all the things you're doing to get in trouble right now.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000 It was, it was getting good advice.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000 And he totally saw it.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.000 He totally saw it.
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000 His kids were crazy in the me.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000 Man, you know, there's that attraction of violence, man.
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000 And just may him when you're a kid.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000 What was violence?
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000 It was just, you know, tying ropes and one tree and low on another one and sliding down on handlebars and just jumping over ridiculous jumps on our bikes.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000 You know, smashing frames on the bikes and just stuff I wanted to admit to.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000 And so, uh, you, you, you had down and you're going to join the Marines.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000 I did. I tried to.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000 And then you got rejected by the Marine Corps for having a GED.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000 And I actually met a guy that was a recruiter back then.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000 And that wasn't 88 or 89.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000 And then they had a restriction.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000 And they had to have a high school diploma.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000 A GED wouldn't get you in.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000 Which I'm, my guardian angels knew.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000 I'd have done four years in Marine Corps.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000 Yeah. I couldn't have done that.
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000 There's no way I couldn't have done that.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000 Yeah. I mean, I like working with them.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000 But pre 9-11.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000 Marine Corps was a lot different.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Yeah.
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.000 Yeah.
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000 We didn't get along too well.
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.000 Pretty non-11.
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000 The Marine Corps are a completely different environment. And, and, and, I mean, they do what they do.
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000 It's actually more, it's more dangerous than what we do.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000 Yeah. And their day-to-day life is freaking, uh, a more Spartan life.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000 You know, especially if you're an infantryman. Like, that's a troll contact.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.000 Yeah, it's a good song.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000 We tell so much, YouTube.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.000 It's a little ghetto.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 I like the way to the air sleep.
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000 That's the goal.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000 Um,
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000 You wrap up here saying,
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000 My childhood was not exactly idyllic, but it's what happened to me.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000 And I'm very grateful for all of it. The wounds of my childhood trauma served as the foundation of some truly excellent resiliency training.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000 That's a very positive way of looking at this spike.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000 Resiliency is a condition responsible in emotional trauma and stress.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000 It's a never ending process of understanding endurance evaluation acceptance and application that continues to help me get through some very difficult situations.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000 Childhood trauma, especially the kind perpetrated by parents, can be some of the most damaging because it can cause children to feel unlovable.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000 Some children who feel unlovable can become unlovable adults and some of those become unlovable parents thus repeating the cycle.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000 The unlovable, live lonely tragic lives.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000 If my hurts mistakes but weapons and insights can help you overcome yours, then this book has value for both of us.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000 I'm not the only one with mommy and daddy issues.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000 Check.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000 I got some code of pregnancy shit going on.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000 You know, I tell people, uh, I mean, we all got insecurities.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000 I don't know, maybe seals got insecurities.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000 I just wanted the most insecure people on the other side.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000 And then I try and sodium hard.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000 Yeah, I was glad to anybody know I'm weak here.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000 I was laughing to the teams if someone says, Hey, you know, Mike, Mike, Dave's really good at a pair of shooting.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000 Someone will chime in the back. Yeah, but he's slow runner.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000 Yeah, you're very exactly what's going to lead you to, but running breeds cowardice.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000 A bunch of cowards.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so now you go to bootcamp to Buds after signing on the dotted line.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000 I spent the next six months working out. Do my best not to get trouble until I finally board the bus for maps and facility in southern Virginia.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000 Maps is the waste station for all new military recruits.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.000 There I found myself part of an interesting blend of Americana, one that includes all shapes sizes, colors and temperatures of young men, women who are leaving for the civil, leaving the civilian world.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Getting the first taste of the US military. You know what that's an accuracy because I went to great lakes.
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000 Well, there you go.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000 I did have a writer with me on this that one that was all dudes up there.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000 What about maps?
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Even even at maps.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000 Yeah, they were sending all the women at the time to Orlando.
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Everybody goes to Great Lakes now. That place sucks.
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000 What is maps?
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000 Military entry processing station.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000 So you actually enlist and you wait a period of time before you go.
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000 They just snatch you say you don't go out.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000 Like do something else.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.000 They don't actually have you.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000 Well, you're not under any kind of restriction or any kind of order under the UCMJ yet you sign a contract.
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000 And they give you a date that you're going to leave.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000 So I was on the on and that's for like six months.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000 I've talked to kids that then you know 18 months.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000 They hit some kid in high school.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000 You know, waiting for graduate.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000 Get him young.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000 I was 17 years old when I joined.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000 I knew I was the guy.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000 This is, I found this funny and this is also probably why you say that the Marine Corps wouldn't have worked out great for you over a long period of time.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000 It's you say I never in my life wanted to quit anything more than I did Navy bootcamp.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000 Missable.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000 Bro.
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000 Yeah.
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000 I mean, there's a golden underwear.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000 Oh, and great likes to January.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.000 Oh, get going forth.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000 Five feet of snow 30 below.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000 I hate the cold weather.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000 I'd rather sweat.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:06.000 You and you said I think the company commander saw some potential me and knew that I was bored because I kept volunteering to wake up at 4 a.m. to do what most people dreaded.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000 They decided to give me some extra responsibility.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000 Made me the divisions recruit the divisions recruit mastered arms.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000 I was like, you're for when I was going through bootcamp.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000 I got made like a squad leader or something.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000 I got fired from that one.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.000 Oh, bummer.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.000 You guys, well, I talked about it in the book. The guy wiped the bugger on my pillow and it right as the company commander was walking in the door. I punched him.
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000 Yeah, it's so that.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000 So you got rolled back from the animation week of bootcamp.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000 And then I get why I got rolled out of in Buds at a 166 and a 168 and I got rolled graduation week of 168.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000 Just ironing to that.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000 Then you made both made me cry.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000 So you got rolled back in in bootcamp, which I didn't even know there was such a thing as getting rolled back in there.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000 It was only one week though, which was cool.
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000 Oh, that's right because because you got a great lakeshore.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000 But you still had to do that stupid passenger view all that margin.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000 Well, nobody was coming to visit me for graduation.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000 I got into that fight because you put a bugger home at the low.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000 I did knock him out. I did knock that kid out.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000 Well, he was not a kid. I was a kid. He was a lot older than me.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000 And so I didn't have to do the passenger view. They just made me like a parking lot of tenant.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000 I didn't want to do it anyway.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000 All that practice.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And we were in a Nazi company too.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000 They all that flags.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000 I remember those stupid flags for I don't even remember what they were for.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000 I actually best marchers best, you fold your underwear the best.
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000 Yeah, this is not like I am very limited memories of boot camp.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.000 I hated it.
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000 Yeah, I know that I hated it.
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000 But I don't remember a lot about it. Remember like the highlights of it.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000 Probably the biggest. I remember just remember shoveling snow.
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000 No, I definitely don't remember snowing snowing snowing.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000 I remember sweating. I remember like sweat.
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000 A giant pool of sweat.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000 I remember the space shuttle took off while we were standing out there.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.000 There was a space shuttle launch.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.000 That's totally cool.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.000 That was like that's cool.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000 But don't remember much from boot camp.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000 So you go from there to see school.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000 And then you get orders.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000 Get orders to go to the USS carol vinsen.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000 Yeah, I which is my first set of orders were to.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000 The carol vinsen via nukesyschool.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000 No machine is made.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000 So basically forever.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000 That doesn't know. That means hello regular Navy.
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000 No no but no seal teams.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000 And I got to watch those guys go through school there.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000 That was at the same place. I was going through a school.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000 There were a bunch of zombies.
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000 Like 12 hours a class.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.000 It's free.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000 It's free.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000 Yeah, that's a decent freaking hard job man.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000 It's a freaking hard job.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.000 I got kicked out of a high school.
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000 I want to be a new guy.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.000 Whenever it was running your career.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000 Consulting was not doing a great job.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.000 They should have been lined.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000 You straight into the freaking buds.
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000 But then you did you this is kind of crazy. Go you like requested captains mass.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.000 No.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000 I just went to his office.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000 So that's even better.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000 You didn't even request captain as you said.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.000 I'm going to go talk to the old man.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000 Yeah, kind of liking you know, I grew to you know,
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000 What was her name that was up there for like longer than anybody was in the seal teams.
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.000 The secretary.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000 Yeah, I talked to the secretary and I was like, I got a problem with my orders.
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000 And I don't know how I got in there, but she let me get in there.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000 And I think the guy was just amazed at some E2 who's coming to his office.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.000 Some food.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000 I'm like real good.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.000 That's insane dude.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000 And I told him, hey, like I passed the test for this screening test for buds.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000 There was 50 of us only like 10 of us passed.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000 I was told I was going to get this on my contract.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000 And this is what I got.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000 It was like, do you understand that you're not supposed to be doing it this way?
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000 That's kind of how to comment.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 I was like, I kind of played in between.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000 I knew it was wrong.
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000 But I didn't care.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 Because there was no way.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000 I was going to New York City School.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000 So whatever I had to do, I was going to do it.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000 And then the dude was cool and just said, alright, I need to care.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000 I got beat a little bit, but on beat.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000 Not like buds.
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000 Do you ever try to count?
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.000 I'm going to push up.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.000 She didn't want to die and buds.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000 And you get up to a thousand.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.000 Did you ever?
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.000 I tried.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000 Really.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000 The 282 is hitting or 72's hitting the back of the head.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000 Forget what you remember.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000 He's I drove the child once.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000 And this guy didn't make it through.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000 He was such a big teddy bear cruise.
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000 Just couldn't run.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000 And we were late for a child.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000 And out of all twig and beetle.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000 I was like, oh, we'll go get a child.
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000 So last was already on.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000 So so now we're fast-wording the buds.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000 We're jumping to buds.
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000 Oh, man. So this is first phase. This was.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000 I can't even remember.
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000 So you put the brakes went out on the thing.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000 The cross, the cross intersection at 75.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000 So I crashed into that thing because my brakes go out.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000 I only hit it like 25, 30 miles an hour.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000 Both of us hit the windshield.
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.000 Start the windshield.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000 When she'll doubt in the middle of 75.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.000 As the buds class.
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000 And the instructors drive by us.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000 And like, oh, God.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000 15, 180 camp body builders that weekend.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000 That weekend. Both of us.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.000 We cheated.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000 No, no, no.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000 Yeah, sometimes you can't buy three.
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000 Sometimes you can't buy five.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.000 You can't do 15.
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.000 I want to.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.000 We're doing.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000 Did you just stand out of the first phase outside the first phase?
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Office or something.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.000 Just sit there.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.000 It was first.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.000 Yeah.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.000 It was right by the bell.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.000 How do you remember?
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000 Was it like, did you do like 750 a day or something like that?
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.000 No, we just.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000 When nobody was looking.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000 I just.
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000 I just.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000 Sometimes they sat in front of us.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000 We can't buy one.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000 As soon as they left, we're like.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000 I've 105.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000 Did you have any idea what you're getting into when you went to buds?
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000 Like what comprehension level did you add?
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.000 I basically.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000 Yeah, I heard it was going to be hard.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000 And that's kind of a mindset of always.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000 I've always gotten out of.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000 And it works. I don't know if it worked for other people, but I always think it's going to be worse than it really is.
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000 So a lot of times it just hard to get started.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000 Like how good of a win?
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000 I know you only were in high school for a couple of years.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000 But how good of a how good.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000 Well, did you I know you wrestled?
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.000 I played football.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.000 I wrestled when I grew up.
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000 I played all sports soccer.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:33.000 I boxed a little bit.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000 Hands of knockouts.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000 I was just getting after it.
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000 I was always vicious.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000 Just getting after it.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.000 I played basketball.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000 Never really scored a point.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000 My coach would just think, I'll foul that guy.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000 So, so you had, so you had some good athletic background.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Yeah, I liked playing sports.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000 So you, but you had no knowledge of buds.
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000 Like, hey, not at all.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000 Did you, did you think about?
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000 Like, I was, I was talk about, you know, when I was quote getting ready for buds.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000 No idea what to expect.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000 I just knew that you ran a lot and you swam a lot.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000 So I ran a lot and I swam a lot.
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000 But I would do, you know, four sets of pull ups and be like, alright.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 You know, that was good workout.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 And it just had no idea that you were going to get the buds.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000 And you were going to do hundreds of pull ups in an hour.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000 Like more than you could count.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000 Well, they do.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000 Don't expect you to be able to turn a 14-month run when you show up.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000 Yeah, it is for the rest of the year.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.000 Yeah.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000 I think they're even getting smarter about it now.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000 They're definitely getting smarter about it.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000 But, um, I should have.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000 And guys are the guys are getting smarter about it.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000 I guess that's my point.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000 People will abuse it too.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.000 What do you mean?
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000 You can only keep me in the water for 10 minutes because the buds.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000 58 degrees.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000 When do you think that chart became a thing?
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000 Uh, after us.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000 We're, are you being serious?
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000 Like, do you think it is after us?
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000 Because I, it is for us.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000 Yeah, I mean, they were just, it was no freaking rules.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000 They probably looked at the student body as a curve.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000 And if somebody won the I put their me on the OK,
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000 I mean, me the take about.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000 I remember that part.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000 I remember them walking down the line and being like,
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000 You can hear me like, I feel like this is pretty good.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000 They shine the flashlight.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000 Yeah, I'm never going to get this guy's get nip in.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000 But if no, if you didn't hear that, then it's like back in the water.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000 And they would just keep you doing that until someone started getting hypothermia.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000 Maybe two people started getting hypothermia.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000 Then they'd be like, on to the next evolution.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000 There wasn't no graph that they were following.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000 No, they do now.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000 I think it's good.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000 There's good and bad to it.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000 I wish the students didn't know it.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000 That's part of the game.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000 Not knowing.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000 And you also met your wife while you were in fourth phase of the old fourth phase.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000 Because it was your, basically, standing might a class up.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000 I don't know what they call it now.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000 Fourth phase.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000 It's still called fourth phase.
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000 So you were there, which is weird.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000 And that's when you, you met your future wife.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000 And then rolling into first phase.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000 Drown proofing.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000 You can't rescue swimmer life saving.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000 Yeah.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000 So I did work with the writers.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000 So some of the stuff is, is changed a little bit.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000 It's a whole process to go into this.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000 What is that word program?
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000 That you got to use when you're editing.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000 Sometimes somethings just get by.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000 Like, man, I can't figure this program.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000 Yeah, it's, uh, it's the plus when you look at something over and over again.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000 You're just going to miss stuff and happens.
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000 Well, and when you work with us today and stuff that they think is interesting.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Uh, is, I'm like, do you want to talk about this?
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000 Check.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000 So there was something that the guy worked with, uh, felt was interesting.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000 And, and he get the proper terminology.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000 And because to me, drown proofing was, we didn't lose many people to that.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000 Yeah, drown proofing.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000 Drown proofing was pretty easy.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000 You mean, you lost a few of the guys.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000 Yeah.
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000 There's a few guys in not tying.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Lose a few guys and the writers were in the water swam.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000 We did lose a few guys in life saving.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000 Because life saving was so interesting.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000 Because it was a subjective thing where they could look at a guy and be like, hey, this guy,
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000 we don't like this guy.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000 They're just trying to drown.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000 Yeah.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000 And then they've gone to drown you and you, they don't like you.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000 Because they have that power.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000 Um, team, do the whole waste push and go down there and tug on or shit and make them comply.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000 It's a scrap.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000 For sure.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000 It is.
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000 I mean, that's what they described.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000 You don't let them grab onto you.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000 You got to get them away from you and sometimes you got to hurt them.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000 They're going to get punched to the gut.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000 You know, they'll calm them down.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000 They definitely, they're going to live.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000 There were some guys that do what they just weren't going to make it.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000 You know, like a guy that they didn't like or whatever had a bad attitude or they thought it was a punk.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000 You're one going to get out of the water.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 Those people have a history too.
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000 It's not just one evolution.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000 It's a third pet of four performance.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000 Yeah.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000 I think that it seems like there's, you think there's structure about that now where there's less subjectivity.
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000 Or you think it's the same.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000 Well, I would just have to say that I know there's some things that have changed.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000 And a lot of guys we like, I think buddhist easier.
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000 But the attrition rates the same.
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000 Yeah.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000 So they're not making any more seals.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000 No.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000 I mean, even with a class that's twice the size, I mean, we would start with like 125 guys to get 20.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000 Mm.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000 Now they're starting with 200 something.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000 Yeah.
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000 Well, I think they start with 165 and they still get whatever whatever.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000 They're still only getting percent of that as.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000 They're still only getting that.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 It's still 75% of nutrition.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000 So it's still.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000 I don't think it's any easier than it used to be.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000 No, I think it's not.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:56.000 I think it's not.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000 I talked to friends that are down there.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000 They're like, no, it's not easier.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000 The other thing that's like one of the evolution might be different that's like, for instance, when I went through we had 272s.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000 They're not as buoyant as the 28.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000 So it was a little bit harder to tread water with those damn tags because they're steel.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000 And they weren't as in buoyant.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000 They know what else they wear on like lightweight boots now, not jungle boots, not old school jungle boots.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000 That was a difference too.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000 That when I was going through is everything was in boots.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000 Yep.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000 They were getting ready to transition to the shoes.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000 So the times were different.
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000 And almost didn't translate.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000 You know, going from boots and then lowering the times because you're in sneakers.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000 It was almost hard.
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000 Yeah.
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000 I just know we wore boots.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000 And then when I eventually picked up what they started wearing, I was like,
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000 Oh, that's way nicer.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000 Yeah.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000 They were going to shameless those garbage new balance, which gave me shin sports.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000 Oh, just the running shoes.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000 Yeah.
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000 Like when you, they didn't.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000 My legs were better off in boots than running sneakers.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000 Mm-hmm.
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000 The sneakers hurt me more.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000 So it was what a 710 pace.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000 That's not bad.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000 And boots.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Yeah.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000 But the thing, that's the other thing that's,
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000 what is it?
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000 The thing that's deceiving about buds is they go, hey,
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000 it's only a 32 minute 4 mile time run.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000 That's an 8 minute mile when you first get there.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000 You go, oh, that's why I can get that no problem.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000 Just in two miles from this morning.
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000 You just do miles from the 288.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000 And then it's five miles.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000 Just five miles to go to Chow three times a day.
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000 You run five miles every day just to eat.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000 Yeah.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000 And not to mention that 4 mile time run.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000 Eight four miles.
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000 I don't know what they do now.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000 But I know that we're tied to our run as far as I could.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000 I wouldn't be able to I would be like barely passing.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000 Well, they do that to every class.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000 Yeah.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 They have that one run that's long.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000 So everybody fails.
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000 It's my game.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 We were doing the five mile time run.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000 And that extra mile was so much harder exponentially.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000 Just to put out for that much longer, just one mile.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000 And they actually had to get rid of that because it was injuring people.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000 And a lot of people were failing it.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000 Crazy.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000 That's what they were paying me on trying to get me kicked out.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000 But I brought it watch.
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000 That was passed.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000 Yes.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000 So how did that happen?
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000 So you brought a watch because that's another thing that's hard.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 You don't know.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 You don't know.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000 And we were running in the U.T.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000 So what phases is this?
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Do you remember?
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000 This is third phase, which was die phase back then.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000 And so you failed one run?
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000 He was failing me on all and everybody behind me.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000 Okay.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000 So you had a B for the instructor?
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000 With, and we're not going to mention names, but he was the phase officer.
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000 And, you know, you know, the game that used to be played there in room inspections.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000 I mean, you're going to fail.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000 You're going to get went and Sandy.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000 And he was in front of me and he was like, why do you have all this stolen equipment in your locker?
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000 I don't know what you're talking about.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000 So he's talking about like extra knives, duties, and CO2's garbage.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000 Right.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000 And I was like, I don't have any of that stuff in my locker.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000 I was just up there.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000 And the conversation just got to the point where he was like, well, one of the two things
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000 is happening.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000 And you're lying or I'm lying. I was like, well, it's not me, so it must be you.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000 But it wasn't like a disrespectful thing.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000 I was answering a damn question.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000 I was just answering his question.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000 He said one of the one of the two things is happening.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000 What is it?
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000 I was like, well, it's not me.
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000 It must be you.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000 Damn.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000 E2.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000 To a narcissistic lieutenant.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000 Yeah, at the time.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000 That's freaking crazy.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000 You had like, you had more balls than me going through.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000 But that wasn't balls.
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000 I was just answering a question.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000 I don't know, man.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000 I don't know if I would have said, I didn't eat me.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000 I guess it depends on how you said it, too.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000 It was not coming from a place to disrespect.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000 I was just totally answering the damn question.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000 You were just like, I'm not lying.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000 I'm not lying.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000 It's you.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000 You asked.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000 I'm answering your questions.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 So he didn't like that.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000 And so now he kind of had it out for you.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000 And then he's sick that guy we were talking about earlier on me.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000 So he started just harassing me.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000 You know, third phase was a lot of classroom.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000 You know, dive physics and all that garbage.
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000 But every break I was getting went and Sandy doing poems, doing push-ups.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000 He was just beating me up and then he started failing me on the runs.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000 And I told him I didn't look.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000 I think I actually named him guy named Doc Flynn.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000 Oh yeah.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000 I went and told him I was like, hey, look, I brought a watch.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 They're failing me.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000 I'm passing these things by like two minutes and they're failing me.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000 And everybody behind me.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000 That's kind of a weird move because you were breaking the rules.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000 Well, I had to.
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000 Yeah, I know, but that's a weird move, man.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000 That's weird move to be the one who's done it though.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000 Yeah, I went and talked to the commanding officer.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000 Yeah, dude.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000 Like I said, you got more balls than I had.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000 I just didn't know any different.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000 Yeah.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000 I wasn't doing it because I thought it was having balls.
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000 I was just, I don't know how else to get out of this.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000 Fix this.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000 So you're not allowed to bring a watch.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000 And you brought a watch.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000 You timed yourself.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000 Yeah, I tied it to the, I remember the buckles on the 80s.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000 Yeah.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000 I tied it to a piece of like 550 cords.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000 I'm gonna hang it down there.
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000 Cool.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000 And so you pat, and how did you sync the loud doc Flynn as the guy that you would trust?
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000 He was just one of the guys in the phase that really never beat us up for no reason.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000 He seemed like a fair dude.
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000 Yeah, I mean, there was two kinds of instructors there.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000 There was guys hiding out that never really did anything.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000 And then there was guys that back in those days too.
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000 There was a whole lot going on.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000 But guys that were operational that just needed a break.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000 So, you know, some of them just beat us up just because they thought they were the gay keepers.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000 You know, kind of like going to some of these armors schools.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000 I'm the gay keeper.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000 We have to have an iteration rate.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000 I mean, I'm gonna make sure you go through something that's hard as I used to.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000 Or I did because their fish story is,
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000 Buds was a lot harder when I went through.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000 And this guy was a skinny little punk.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000 But he later got a minister and he separated.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000 That was something else he'd done.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000 So, the car was a bitch.
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000 Yeah.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000 So then, but Doc Flynn was like, alright, cool.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000 And then he ran the next run.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000 And he said, I'm gonna run run run the pace.
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000 And if you finish in front of me, he passed.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000 Doc Flynn legit.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000 So he ran it.
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000 And this was a five-mile time run, which they got rid of.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000 He came across the finish line and you know what happens when you're the cutoff guy.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000 How many times can you be the cutoff guy every day on time?
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000 Yeah.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000 Now, that's one of my LPO's who you know.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000 He probably, you know, when I used my first LPO.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000 And I was like, coming out of Buds and asking him,
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000 Buds questions, like, did you ever, were you ever in the Goons squad?
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000 And he was, I was the cutoff of the Goons squad.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000 He said every single run, he was kind of like the Goons squad.
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000 You know what?
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000 That was the only time I got into the Goons squad to the whole time through Buds.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000 But was all those time runs.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000 And what I was good at was winning that first race.
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000 And you see, you get secured from the Goons squad.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000 Yeah.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000 So then, so then what happened?
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000 Uh, well, he came across the finish line.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000 And when you're cut off for the Goons squad,
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000 you get sent to the water.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000 And that's where you wind up when you fail that run.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000 He comes across, you know, a couple minutes after we finished and we're getting hammered.
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000 And he was like, what's going on with those guys?
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000 And he was like, well, they all failed.
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000 And Flynn was like, I just did it.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000 I just passed it.
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000 They're like two minutes in front of me.
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.000 Um, but it got hidden because I went to a review board and still got rolled back.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000 I got rolled back.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000 That was graduation week.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000 And I got rolled back to Dragherface.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000 At least I didn't have to do the open circuit garbage again.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000 Yeah, this was when this was when die phase was third phase.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000 When I went through a year or two later,
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000 die phase was second phase because they still get rid of a lot of guys during die phase.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000 Yeah, it's that to me.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000 I thought it was the hardest phase.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000 Die phase?
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000 Yeah.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000 Yeah, I think I think that's why they moved it to that.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Well, we lost more people there.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000 We don't lose people in line warfare.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000 Yeah.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000 Yeah.
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000 Yeah, I got to be pretty stupid.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000 I think we lost two guys.
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000 Yeah, we pretty stupid.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000 Yeah.
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000 One of the guys was a good dude.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000 I think he did something that they didn't like.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000 And they got rid of them.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000 He was an officer too.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000 Personal.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000 Yeah.
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000 I don't happen.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000 Crazy.
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000 That's a pretty critical community.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000 It self-regulates though.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000 We're those.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000 Indeed.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000 And then where do you at?
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000 SQT.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000 Did you go through, you went through STT?
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000 Right?
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000 Well, it was kind of a weird one.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000 It wasn't.
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000 SQT like it is now.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000 It was kind of thrown together at the team.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Yeah, because you went to team through it.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000 Yeah, but they cooperated with the other teams.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000 So I went through whatever they go.
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000 I think it was called STT.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000 It's done.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000 And it was just, because we had training cells at each of the teams and they would run it.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000 Yeah.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000 So we were meshed together with team 1-3-5.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000 And it was kind of ad hoc.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000 And then they jammed us into bulltoons and the bulltoons pretty much still care of us.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000 We didn't have our tridents back then.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000 Either guy showed up at the teams now with the tridents.
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000 We actually had a different NEC when we was at a 53-20-20.
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000 Yeah.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000 Then it was up to your bulltoons to decide when you got it.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000 Well, they started giving the guys tridents in SQT.
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000 So they'd show up to the team.
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000 Guys were taking the new guys that showed up with their tridents and making him pay him.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000 Painting him blue for him.
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000 They're in there.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000 But they still kind of kept the tradition.
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000 Like you can go back in the bulltoons now.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000 The bulltoons with the new guys.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000 So like you don't get your trident even though it's been put in your admin record.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000 We're not going to give it to you until we say it's.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000 And then they'll have like the fish tank or you've seen one of those pack man frogs.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000 I've seen a pack man frog with all the tridents in it.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000 They got to keep the frog alive.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000 Oh, that's legit.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000 It's a fun community.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000 Yeah.
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000 And there's, you know, you talk about some of the fun in the community.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000 That's college I ever went to.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000 Yeah.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000 Some of the fun of the community which is called hazing.
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000 You're a tolerance that never happens.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000 Yeah.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Yeah.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000 I see that's a good thing about hazing.
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000 Especially probably now also.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000 I know there's a zero tolerance and it doesn't happen.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000 But if you don't get hazed, they don't like you.
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000 They don't trust you.
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000 Yeah.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000 So if you get hazed, you know, like I'll get this guys.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000 So it's like a privilege.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000 Thank you, sir.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000 Can I have another?
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000 Okay.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000 There ain't a nothing in her.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000 Not a noffy yet.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000 One of the things you said here is you're getting your bird.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000 And this all sounded good.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000 I just, this brought back memories.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000 The, the commanding officer was the last guy to pounded my tried and he had a big grin
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000 on his face as he approached.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000 He pulled the tried and out of my body.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000 Because this is after you, we want to get your tried and, you know, well, we still
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000 quarters.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000 Two.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000 Yeah.
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000 I don't know who paid, I thought so.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000 I think it was my cartoon commander.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000 But though anyways, the whole team freaking lines up and pounds that thing into your chest.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000 You know, though, that doesn't hurt.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000 Yeah.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000 I mean, well, okay, maybe didn't hurt you.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000 I mean, I mean, the punch, but you actually feel the prongs after the first eight.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000 You know, you're bleeding.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000 But then, but then, guys start pulling it out.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000 Oh, it's a little crooked, Jocko.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000 And they get you again.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Bad hurts worse.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000 But what I like, yeah, it's got like those little nubs on the end of the world.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000 It's a little wiggits attached to.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000 Yeah.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000 When you pull it out, you can feel it pulling your chest.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000 Coming out.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000 But you say you're commanding officer.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000 He pulled the tried and out of my body straight.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000 Did like he was fixing it up a bent nail.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000 Then he placed it on my chest and slowly pushed it back in.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000 That hurts worse.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000 I was going to say that's freaking good times from the old man, right?
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000 There.
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000 That's the back of the days where the back 40 was.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000 We're out of two adjustments.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000 We're made.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000 Yeah.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000 Now you're going on peacetime deployment.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000 You say this.
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000 My peacetime deployments took me around the globe.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000 Asia, Middle East, Egypt, Kuwait, Japan, Korea, Guam, points beyond.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000 And in between, connecting joint, country, country, training.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000 All my deployment to Bahrain.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000 We patrol the Persian Gulf and forcing oil embargoes.
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000 We would board oil tankers that were in violation of various infractions.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000 Most of the time, the infractions that they didn't identify themselves because they're
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000 radioed in work.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000 We were catchers.
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000 We were catch tankers bearing the Iranian flag.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000 Filled with embargoed Iraq oil.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000 All sorts of shenanigans going on.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000 So would you do four deployments?
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000 What'd you do in that first run at team three, four, four?
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000 And the first one was Southeast Asia.
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000 That was like right after the Gulf War.
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000 Would you go to the PI?
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000 I went to the PI.
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000 Yeah.
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000 So then I think your network happened so fast.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000 We couldn't get there.
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000 Then you end up, you're, it looked like you were going to go to Buds and be an instructor.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000 Yeah.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000 But you actually had orders.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000 You had orders to Buds.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000 And then what, what, how did you, how did you hear about the Leap Frog trial?
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000 I was just by chance.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000 And I only had like 30, 35 jumps.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000 That's insane.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000 I had no idea what I was doing.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000 That's insane.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000 I mean, those guys, at that time, had thousands of jumps.
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Well, there was, there was some guys on that team that had, what was that program?
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000 We used to have our own, what we still do, the original freeball program that we had.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000 Which is the military freefall that was out.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000 Like three something, three M3T.
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000 I can't remember about it.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000 But it was our own program out there at El Saito.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000 That's, that's untrue.
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000 Yeah.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000 You know, so a lot of those instructors were on the team with me.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000 Dwight Saito, the anti crowd handle,
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000 Oh, Glagiacs, they all had a couple thousand plus jumps.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000 Yeah, those guys, I'm talking about like they were freaking out.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000 30.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000 So you decided, hey, what the hell, I'll go get a bunch of jumps in.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000 I know, I was making it.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000 I was thinking, I got like 45 jumps, try outs with the cool parachute.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000 And then you ended up making it.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000 Yeah, well, it was freaking crazy.
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000 Glagiac told me he could teach a monkey to fall out in their plane
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000 to be out in the bananas.
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000 That was, I didn't think I was going to make it.
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000 I thought I was going to bust.
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000 And I really didn't want to.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000 The jump team was, was some of the most fun I had.
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000 Probably one of the most dangerous jobs I had until combat.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000 Yeah, the jump team at that time, man, they were pushing the envelope hard core.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000 Yeah, we had some injuries.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000 We had a death when I was on the, on the jump team.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000 I remember I was doing like my, whatever my jumps to get my gold wings.
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000 When I first got the team, like I didn't, I tried it,
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000 but they sent me down to the freaking brown field to go get some jumps.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000 And the jump team was jumping.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000 And they did like a down, I'd never seen a free fall person in my life.
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000 Never seen a free fall jump.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000 And I landed and got my shoot all packed up or whatever.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000 And then income the leap frogs.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000 And they did a down plane.
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000 They were going to thousand miles an hour as far as I could tell.
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000 And I, they were so straight down.
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000 And I, I could hear them say break.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.000 Yeah.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000 And I was like, holy shit.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000 This is insane.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:17.000 We had a guy.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000 Sheed himself.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000 He broke too low and went into this stadium,
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000 which at the time was Jack Murphy.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000 That was a long time ago.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000 It was.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000 And he hit like four seats and ripped them out of the ground.
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000 Those things are bolted into the crown and the crown creed.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000 And he walked away from it.
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000 Yeah, it was Tommy Markey.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000 Yeah, which is no Tommy.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000 You could hit that dude upside the head with a bat.
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000 What a beast.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000 He's gone now.
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000 He's going to be.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000 Couldn't hurt him.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000 Yeah, no, that's what I mean.
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000 He's just a monster.
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000 And nice.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000 That he's there too.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000 Yeah.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000 You got this little section here.
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000 While we were falling towards your three guys doing all kinds of crazy jump.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000 And while we're falling toward the earth, another guy and I had to crawl out from
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000 underneath canopies to clear airspace.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000 So you guys were doing crew relative work.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000 You're all freaking wrapped up.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000 I can't say exactly how fast we were falling as we were as there were fully and partially inflated
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000 parachutes, but even slowly falling out of the sky can be deadly.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000 I was still recovering from the tear of my first cut away when my second happened a few days later.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000 Me and another guy got tangled up and caught in the helicopter spin.
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000 The deployment bag retraction system on the tops of our parachutes and somehow got entangled together.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000 We were twirling around opposite each other, falling.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000 He was looking directly at me and I and him and we yelled back and forth at each other.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Cut away.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000 No, you cut away.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000 Like the world's most high-stit game of rock paper scissors he won and I cut away.
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000 He's a good long time friend of mine.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000 He's a big pussy.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000 He should have cut away.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000 He was scared.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000 I don't even know how that happened.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000 How you guys got all wrapped up?
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000 I know how the wrap happened, but our parachutes got connected to each other was ridiculous.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000 Those are canopy relative work parachutes.
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000 Usually when you open a parachute there's a trailing pilot sheet.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000 While on those because you're doing career you don't want that stuff trailing.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000 It has a retraction system on a three-ring retraction system.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000 It pulls it up to the top skin of the parachute.
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000 And that's what got connected on both of ours.
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000 It was a wrap.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000 We were doing like eight man stack rotations.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000 Guy peels off the top and flies all the way to the bottom.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000 That's how it started.
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000 And you get into a wrap like five six dudes.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000 Some get shot out.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000 And some get wrapped up.
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000 And everybody broke out of that and we were just stuck.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000 And did it happen on film?
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000 No, because we, you know what, back then.
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000 There was no such thing as a girl GoPro.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000 GoPro.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000 I mean, guys were still taken.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000 I think I remember going from Paul Robinson was one of our camera guys.
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000 And he had this giant enormous freaking.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000 When he opened those spares, you got the whole this head.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000 His, his, his, his head down because he had all this weight up there.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000 Break his neck.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000 Now they used to jump.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000 It wasn't film.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000 So I think we had a high eight, which is a pretty large camera.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000 It's not GoPro.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000 Any clown can jump a clope.
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000 So, uh, that blow tubes on the camera.
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000 You had to take a picture.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000 Oh, that was like a radical.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000 That's how you, uh, take a fire.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000 Oh, no kidding.
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000 You'd have to start the camera before you went out.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000 But the still camera because they would have a video and a, and a still and they had a blow tube.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000 You have to blow into the tube to take a picture.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000 And then you had a radical here.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000 I remember seeing guys jump those little radicals.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000 So they do wear their aim.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000 Yeah.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000 Crazy.
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000 Yeah, you guys were pushing the envelope back then with the, with the jump team.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000 You did three years there and then you go back to the teams.
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000 And would you go, did you go to, you went to East Coast?
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000 I wanted to teammate.
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000 What year was that?
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000 Uh, 99.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000 Check.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000 And you, and that was Kosovo.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000 Yeah, I was going to say you rolled on there.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000 Um, NATO was allied with the ethnic Albanian forces and we were tasked with working with NATO
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.96 to assist them in apprehending suspected to war criminals and keeping eye out on the movements of various
01:06:27.96 --> 01:06:29.96 warring, foreign factions.
01:06:29.96 --> 01:06:31.96 Kosovo was a real world test.
01:06:31.96 --> 01:06:36.96 We would do 72 hour special reconnaissance missions in rugged terrain full of natural man made threats.
01:06:36.96 --> 01:06:44.96 We did 25 S.R. missions in six months averaging about one a week with one day of prep three days on a debrief on the other end.
01:06:44.96 --> 01:06:46.96 It was a kick in the butt deployment.
01:06:46.96 --> 01:06:50.96 And conventional forces don't react to anything inside of 72 hours.
01:06:50.96 --> 01:06:51.96 Yeah.
01:06:51.96 --> 01:06:53.96 It's better to sit around.
01:06:53.96 --> 01:06:54.96 Yeah.
01:06:54.96 --> 01:06:55.96 That's, that's still.
01:06:55.96 --> 01:06:58.96 At that time doing real missions was awesome.
01:06:58.96 --> 01:06:59.96 Well, we thought that was the game.
01:06:59.96 --> 01:07:00.96 For sure.
01:07:00.96 --> 01:07:01.96 For sure.
01:07:01.96 --> 01:07:03.96 You can't bond still.
01:07:03.96 --> 01:07:06.96 You can get the restrictions that they had on the guys out there.
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:07.96 It was ridiculous.
01:07:07.96 --> 01:07:10.96 I mean, they had to put,
01:07:10.96 --> 01:07:12.96 rigorous tape over their magazine.
01:07:12.96 --> 01:07:14.96 Well, they had to put rigorous tape over their magazine.
01:07:14.96 --> 01:07:16.96 Um, who?
01:07:16.96 --> 01:07:19.96 Everybody that was out there were supposed to do that.
01:07:19.96 --> 01:07:20.96 We didn't do it.
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:21.96 Um,
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:23.96 I mean, it's not unusual to have.
01:07:23.96 --> 01:07:26.96 They had to do to had an idea at the front gate with a 50 cal.
01:07:26.96 --> 01:07:27.96 Okay.
01:07:27.96 --> 01:07:29.96 But that's their clearing process.
01:07:29.96 --> 01:07:31.96 At the end, they pulled the trigger.
01:07:31.96 --> 01:07:32.96 Yeah.
01:07:32.96 --> 01:07:33.96 Yeah.
01:07:33.96 --> 01:07:36.96 Why do you kind of pull the trigger to clear and save a weapon?
01:07:36.96 --> 01:07:37.96 Well, at least you got it.
01:07:37.96 --> 01:07:38.96 I hope you had to point in the safe direction.
01:07:38.96 --> 01:07:39.96 He did.
01:07:39.96 --> 01:07:40.96 Okay.
01:07:40.96 --> 01:07:41.96 We'll think it.
01:07:41.96 --> 01:07:44.96 You ever seen a 50 cal sheet 10 feet in front of you?
01:07:44.96 --> 01:07:48.96 Uh, I'm pretty impressive.
01:07:48.96 --> 01:07:51.96 So that's 99 come back from that point.
01:07:51.96 --> 01:07:53.96 Again, I'm skipping a bunch of stuff here.
01:07:53.96 --> 01:07:55.96 Really cool information about what those deployments were like.
01:07:55.96 --> 01:08:00.96 That's why people got to buy the book to get some of those details.
01:08:00.96 --> 01:08:02.96 Jump and head a little bit.
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:05.96 Uh, reported to Naval Special Warfare Group 2 training
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:09.96 Detachment on September 8th, 2001.
01:08:09.96 --> 01:08:13.96 New instructor role be there for two years.
01:08:13.96 --> 01:08:15.96 That was the week.
01:08:15.96 --> 01:08:16.96 9 11.
01:08:16.96 --> 01:08:17.96 Yeah.
01:08:17.96 --> 01:08:18.96 I was going to say September 11.
01:08:18.96 --> 01:08:20.96 So you just check in to trade at.
01:08:20.96 --> 01:08:21.96 Nobody wanted to go there.
01:08:21.96 --> 01:08:22.96 Of course not.
01:08:22.96 --> 01:08:23.96 When.
01:08:23.96 --> 01:08:25.96 When did you start the model now?
01:08:25.96 --> 01:08:28.96 When did you uh, what were you teaching?
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:29.96 I kind of bounced around.
01:08:29.96 --> 01:08:30.96 I got over there.
01:08:30.96 --> 01:08:31.96 Did all the air stuff.
01:08:31.96 --> 01:08:32.96 Uh, at first.
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:35.96 Then I didn't land warfare.
01:08:35.96 --> 01:08:36.96 And uh, CQC.
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:39.96 I just kind of bounced around all the way to the place.
01:08:39.96 --> 01:08:40.96 Yeah.
01:08:40.96 --> 01:08:45.96 I mean, trade at has become such a great place to develop seals.
01:08:45.96 --> 01:08:47.96 I mean, it really is.
01:08:47.96 --> 01:08:51.96 And back in the day, like when when you and I first got to the team, I don't know
01:08:51.96 --> 01:08:53.96 one wanted to be in training cell.
01:08:53.96 --> 01:08:54.96 And I did.
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:55.96 They all got it.
01:08:55.96 --> 01:08:56.96 They all weren't.
01:08:56.96 --> 01:08:57.96 Yeah.
01:08:57.96 --> 01:08:58.96 They did.
01:08:58.96 --> 01:08:59.96 They did.
01:08:59.96 --> 01:09:00.96 They did.
01:09:00.96 --> 01:09:01.96 They all mashed a team.
01:09:01.96 --> 01:09:02.96 That's one master.
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:04.96 So you couldn't figure out what the mashed team did in the seal teams.
01:09:04.96 --> 01:09:05.96 Yeah.
01:09:05.96 --> 01:09:06.96 I'll tell you.
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:08.96 I got some good advice from some of those old mashed.
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:08.96 She's in one officer's that would say, like, hey, if you want to learn this stuff, you've got to go teach it.
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:09.96 Yeah.
01:09:09.96 --> 01:09:12.96 And I was lucky enough to go into training cell at CQC.
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:14.96 One spent a couple years there.
01:09:14.96 --> 01:09:15.96 And it was, I did.
01:09:15.96 --> 01:09:16.96 I learned.
01:09:16.96 --> 01:09:23.96 I figured out the other day I had made some estimate, like 50% of what I learned in the entire teams was
01:09:23.96 --> 01:09:25.96 was working for whatever it was.
01:09:25.96 --> 01:09:28.96 Three years or two and a half years in training cell at CQC.
01:09:28.96 --> 01:09:29.96 One.
01:09:29.96 --> 01:09:30.96 And what's in 10 groups do the same thing?
01:09:30.96 --> 01:09:31.96 10 groups do that.
01:09:31.96 --> 01:09:35.96 What the teaching teaching junior officers that are going through STT, how to do an eye-ad.
01:09:35.96 --> 01:09:39.96 Like how what to react in these different situations and then watching them and seeing the mistakes they make.
01:09:39.96 --> 01:09:41.96 That was 40% of what I learned.
01:09:41.96 --> 01:09:45.96 Another big chunk of what I learned was when I was a trade-at later on.
01:09:45.96 --> 01:09:47.96 You know, same thing.
01:09:47.96 --> 01:09:48.96 You're teaching guys.
01:09:48.96 --> 01:09:49.96 You're watching them do it.
01:09:49.96 --> 01:09:50.96 You're seeing the mistakes.
01:09:50.96 --> 01:09:51.96 They make.
01:09:51.96 --> 01:09:52.96 You're putting them through drills.
01:09:52.96 --> 01:09:54.96 You're seeing the same platoons go through the same training.
01:09:54.96 --> 01:09:55.96 Evolutions.
01:09:55.96 --> 01:09:56.96 What the leaders do.
01:09:56.96 --> 01:09:57.96 What mistakes they make.
01:09:57.96 --> 01:10:01.96 So yeah, going into training cell and training attachment is a great step.
01:10:01.96 --> 01:10:05.96 And it's a great system now because guys go they, you know, they get there and
01:10:05.96 --> 01:10:07.96 E5 and then they go there.
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:09.96 They make E6 and then they go in there and put two now peel.
01:10:09.96 --> 01:10:10.96 They just got done teaching the stuff man.
01:10:10.96 --> 01:10:11.96 They're ready.
01:10:11.96 --> 01:10:12.96 They're almost the time.
01:10:12.96 --> 01:10:15.96 Well, they're getting there a little bit faster than we used to also.
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:16.96 Yeah.
01:10:16.96 --> 01:10:20.96 Yeah, it's a little it's way more formalized the way it all works now, which is freaking
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:21.96 Good for them.
01:10:21.96 --> 01:10:22.96 Well, I just left trade-at.
01:10:22.96 --> 01:10:23.96 I was a contractor there.
01:10:23.96 --> 01:10:28.96 Well, when I left the care coalition after seven years, I went to teach in military
01:10:28.96 --> 01:10:31.96 Freefall, head and injury and then went to CQC south.
01:10:31.96 --> 01:10:32.96 Yeah.
01:10:32.96 --> 01:10:37.96 And it was interesting seeing guys that when I was the platoon chief are now like leaders.
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:38.96 They're a member.
01:10:38.96 --> 01:10:39.96 Guys, it was a little re-six.
01:10:39.96 --> 01:10:43.96 When I was a platoon chief, for now master chiefs and some of the new guys are doing their
01:10:43.96 --> 01:10:48.96 Platoon chief slot and was fun to watch and watch them go through and it's always terrified too.
01:10:48.96 --> 01:10:53.96 When I was doing my platoon chief slot, you know, like I said, we have Aaron security.
01:10:53.96 --> 01:10:54.96 I didn't want anybody to get hurt.
01:10:54.96 --> 01:10:58.96 I want to make sure I provided everything that the guys needed.
01:10:58.96 --> 01:11:04.96 They used to tell me when I started the micromanage, hey, chief get out of my back pocket
01:11:04.96 --> 01:11:07.96 because you can't manage all that crap.
01:11:07.96 --> 01:11:14.96 And quite honestly, the words guys that were more experienced that were junior to me when I was in charge.
01:11:14.96 --> 01:11:22.96 And then you just got to know when you know what you don't let the people that are more experienced,
01:11:22.96 --> 01:11:24.96 you know, take those reins.
01:11:24.96 --> 01:11:28.96 Yeah, and you got to be, you got to have a confidence in your leadership that you know,
01:11:28.96 --> 01:11:31.96 oh, you're, hey, you've done this sort of thing before you run it.
01:11:31.96 --> 01:11:32.96 No fact or no problem.
01:11:32.96 --> 01:11:33.96 Good to go.
01:11:33.96 --> 01:11:35.96 Oh, my crommandaging hurts.
01:11:35.96 --> 01:11:36.96 Oh, yeah.
01:11:36.96 --> 01:11:40.96 I'm just freaking, it's a disaster, a lot of hours.
01:11:40.96 --> 01:11:48.96 Uh, so um, so then you get done with trade at, you go to team four, your, your,
01:11:48.96 --> 01:11:51.96 you go, you go on deployment.
01:11:51.96 --> 01:11:52.96 Where'd you go?
01:11:52.96 --> 01:11:53.96 Baghdad?
01:11:53.96 --> 01:11:54.96 Oh, yeah.
01:11:54.96 --> 01:11:56.96 You go, you go into Baghdad.
01:11:56.96 --> 01:12:01.96 I know you got to do some team four at the time was actually, they had nine details.
01:12:01.96 --> 01:12:02.96 Which was huge.
01:12:02.96 --> 01:12:06.96 Nobody nobody in the field teams wanted to do the PSD.
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:07.96 Yep.
01:12:07.96 --> 01:12:14.96 So yeah, for people that don't know, one of the major taskings at the SEALteams got in 2005.
01:12:14.96 --> 01:12:15.96 It's the 4500.
01:12:15.96 --> 01:12:16.96 I think it's 4500.
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:16.96 The 42500.
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:22.96 Everyone got the job to protect the senior leadership of the new Iraqi government.
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:23.96 Everyone.
01:12:23.96 --> 01:12:24.96 Well, not everyone.
01:12:24.96 --> 01:12:27.96 But a whole bunch of people wanted to kill those guys.
01:12:27.96 --> 01:12:31.64 The people that got the job to protect him was the seal teams
01:12:32.12 --> 01:12:41.16 So that's what you know you did in then of course. There's a whole lot of things that that are that are wrapped up and doing that because
01:12:41.16 --> 01:12:46.56 If you're proactive about it that means we're gonna go try and capture bad guys or kill bad guys that might be trying to target our people
01:12:46.68 --> 01:12:51.000 We're also doing intelligence gathering. We're going out and figuring out who's trying to kill these people?
01:12:51.84 --> 01:12:56.16 That's a great setup. That's what I did. Yeah, I didn't do the actual entering your protection
01:12:56.16 --> 01:13:00.32 I was far outering looking for threats that were going after
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:08.96 targets within those PSDs. Yeah, yeah, and we had nine and they all want every everyone of those politicians
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:10.96 I want my Navy Seals
01:13:11.76 --> 01:13:13.76 We don't want to work with you people
01:13:14.32 --> 01:13:18.80 Yeah, that was a harsh harsh one harsh pill to swallow for a lot of guys. I got lucky
01:13:18.80 --> 01:13:23.52 I was it started right after I left and it ended before I came back
01:13:23.52 --> 01:13:30.32 Well, I think it all got turned over there. There's actually military units that that's what they do. Yeah, we got turned over to them
01:13:30.32 --> 01:13:32.32 Yeah
01:13:32.32 --> 01:13:38.000 You did have some good times on that when here we go. We were speeding down the road and slid do a left turn as soon as we we made the corner
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.24 I nearly smashed into a makeshift roadblock
01:13:40.40 --> 01:13:44.32 We must have been moving too fast as we caught the roadblock construction crew off guard. We still had there
01:13:44.72 --> 01:13:47.12 Who still had their AK strapped to their backs?
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:52.96 The friends at all taken up positions on the right side of the road and had their weapons trained on us ready to shoot
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:59.04 Is we spring it around the corner and split second the construction crew found themselves in a very awkward position pinned between us
01:13:59.28 --> 01:14:04.24 Their friends and their friends who wanted to shoot us in the confusion. We managed to get the jump on them
01:14:04.72 --> 01:14:06.72 the lead humvee
01:14:07.12 --> 01:14:09.84 Was equipped with a mini gun those things are all
01:14:10.56 --> 01:14:17.36 I never we never got it. I know I have to use a certain level of reverence when I say that because it is so awesome to have a mini gun on on there
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:24.56 And the gunner had the reflexes of a mongous 40 feet away the targets and their rifle-wielding friends
01:14:24.56 --> 01:14:28.24 I had a front row seat to the action when the gunner opened up on all of them
01:14:28.24 --> 01:14:33.04 I had not seen a mini gun in live combat before so I was a little surprised by what happened next
01:14:33.84 --> 01:14:37.28 By the way, there's nothing mini about a mini gun. It's a pedestal mounted six barrel road
01:14:37.28 --> 01:14:40.16 Remachine gun that chooses many a 6,000 rounds of
01:14:40.72 --> 01:14:46.32 7.62 by 51 every minute and the bull is about the size of a triple-A battery
01:14:46.32 --> 01:14:51.68 But let's spit so fast fast out of the gattling style rotating barrels that it look like a red laser beam
01:14:51.68 --> 01:14:55.12 And sound like the mating call of some bizarre prehistoric bird
01:14:55.60 --> 01:15:00.72 The first volleyable it's hit one guy in the chest as he practically vaporized and a bird burst of red mist
01:15:01.28 --> 01:15:07.68 As this was going on about 50 yards up the road and another enemy fighter popped up and fired an RPG directly at the lead humvee
01:15:07.68 --> 01:15:11.20 The one that was firing the mini gun. I couldn't see the RPG but I saw the humvee
01:15:11.52 --> 01:15:15.04 10 feet in front of me lift up drop back down with a crash and catch on fire
01:15:15.04 --> 01:15:22.08 The gunner didn't even flinch. He just kept on shooting in 30 seconds the 25 or so ambushers including the RPG
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:27.68 Triggerman had all been killed and were all red piles of flesh spread over the street when it was
01:15:27.68 --> 01:15:33.12 Overweigh secured the area salvaged what we could from the still burning humvee and then destroyed it with a thermite grenade
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:39.60 The mini gun turned 25 human beings into shredded flesh and less than a minute that was quick. I thought
01:15:39.60 --> 01:15:44.16 And then I felt weird because the next thought I had was that was awesome
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:48.000 Awesome because we did not get killed then because the power of the mini gun
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.96 It was this was the first time I had seen people in the process of dying
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:56.16 But it was not the first time seeing dead people my life and training it prepared me for these situations
01:15:56.16 --> 01:15:59.20 My constant inoculation of violence and stress made what would have been
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:06.24 Grow task and unbearable to many and acceptable situation to me my trauma had conditioned me to accept the unacceptable
01:16:06.24 --> 01:16:11.76 That's what war does it changes the way you view the world. I found no pleasure whatsoever in killing the enemy
01:16:12.32 --> 01:16:14.72 However, this was an outcome of war
01:16:14.72 --> 01:16:18.88 Everyone at some point was someone's child, but that thought is lost in war
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:25.44 The most profane aspects of war is that it deletes the humanity from humans
01:16:25.44 --> 01:16:31.52 It's pretty much forget about everything you believe
01:16:33.28 --> 01:16:38.56 You know, you're not thinking about that when you're in a gunfight. Do the allergy religion
01:16:39.76 --> 01:16:41.76 Political whatever sticks
01:16:41.76 --> 01:16:43.76 Dude's trying to kill me
01:16:44.88 --> 01:16:46.88 I'm gonna work on him
01:16:47.28 --> 01:16:49.84 You get home from that deployment and then
01:16:49.84 --> 01:16:54.24 Then then you did that when you get rolled into doing a platoon chief?
01:16:55.52 --> 01:16:57.52 Yeah
01:16:59.04 --> 01:17:01.04 Do you work up
01:17:01.84 --> 01:17:03.84 How's it work up?
01:17:03.84 --> 01:17:05.84 well
01:17:07.36 --> 01:17:09.04 The work up prior is pretty interesting
01:17:09.60 --> 01:17:13.44 Because I interfaceed with all the guys that were going to be in the platoon was a platoon chief and
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:17.52 I remember breaking one of the guys nods on right before and up
01:17:17.52 --> 01:17:20.88 He didn't know it was gonna be a platoon chief. He kind of cheered me out
01:17:21.52 --> 01:17:24.000 I was like, Dave, don't put your stuff on the ground. I want stuff on it
01:17:27.20 --> 01:17:32.24 I did feel stupid about that but the work up is you know pretty pretty standard we were on an 18-month cycle
01:17:32.24 --> 01:17:34.24 I think on that one
01:17:34.24 --> 01:17:39.28 I think it was 18-month cycle so it's a year long work up you know broken up into three into three parts
01:17:39.28 --> 01:17:41.28 You know, pro-to-have everybody going to schools
01:17:41.28 --> 01:17:46.32 um and ULT just doing all the standard
01:17:47.04 --> 01:17:49.04 T-C-C-South
01:17:48.88 --> 01:17:53.12 Air did you guys know that you were going to Iraq when you hadn't formed up?
01:17:53.12 --> 01:17:56.32 We were kind of the bastard children too everybody was looking for the shiny object
01:17:56.32 --> 01:17:58.32 Not the time that was some task force and
01:17:59.92 --> 01:18:01.92 We got what was
01:18:02.72 --> 01:18:07.44 Thought to be the least of the shiny best deployments which was fulusa
01:18:07.76 --> 01:18:09.92 And they the guys that were there weren't doing anything
01:18:09.92 --> 01:18:15.20 But we worked different we worked intel different than they did and we were really busy
01:18:15.60 --> 01:18:17.92 And I did 140 DAs on that deployment which is
01:18:19.60 --> 01:18:24.64 Talked the guys in the sealed teams to do 100 DAs on the deployments unheard of
01:18:26.24 --> 01:18:28.24 And then on top of that
01:18:28.80 --> 01:18:34.48 Teaching medical classes to the military units that there the you know second fourth Iraqi army brigade and
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:38.48 Teaching tactics and how to patrol and trying to work with the mid teams
01:18:38.48 --> 01:18:40.48 It's you know
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:47.28 When you run a target for your regular job it's kind of hard to come and be a mid team and in full use of proper
01:18:48.08 --> 01:18:51.44 Yola and run a military unit especially when I don't speak English
01:18:52.08 --> 01:18:54.08 Because their standard of work is not what
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.36 No, it is not
01:18:57.36 --> 01:19:05.76 And I was one of the hardest things for us to get to was we when we first got there we we had these expectations that they were going to get to the level that we were at least close and
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:10.24 That's just not gonna happen you got to see okay this right here
01:19:10.48 --> 01:19:12.96 This is what we wanted to be at but right here's got to be acceptable
01:19:14.80 --> 01:19:19.28 It's kind of like you're us over there. Yeah, you got to definitely adjust your standards in a real big way
01:19:19.28 --> 01:19:22.000 Yeah, but it's kind of cool because I'm thinking about you know your last
01:19:22.16 --> 01:19:27.12 Your previous deployment where you were kind of gathering a lot of intel and stuff like that and then you roll out because
01:19:27.52 --> 01:19:32.56 As you know we drive our own operations and if you can make you can find intel and you can put it together
01:19:32.64 --> 01:19:35.04 You can put up a target package. Let's go hit it, you know
01:19:35.04 --> 01:19:41.84 That's you know to get that to get a bunch of DA's down like that. It's not the sexy thing to do the hard part
01:19:42.24 --> 01:19:46.32 It's getting the target packages put it together the fun parts going out and hitting almost team guys
01:19:46.32 --> 01:19:49.68 I just just show me what door. I don't even care to show me what the door
01:19:51.12 --> 01:19:57.36 It's a lot harder to get the information so you're on this deployment you're doing all these DA's
01:19:58.64 --> 01:20:00.64 And now we're gonna get into
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:04.96 April
01:20:04.96 --> 01:20:06.96 2007
01:20:06.96 --> 01:20:07.92 Northeast of
01:20:07.92 --> 01:20:09.92 Felicia when the shooting stopped
01:20:11.04 --> 01:20:13.76 I was still on the floor lying on my left side
01:20:14.48 --> 01:20:17.36 So this is picking up where we started the this whole
01:20:18.80 --> 01:20:20.80 This whole podcast out
01:20:21.52 --> 01:20:26.32 When the shooting stopped I was still on the floor lying on my left side I pushed myself up to my knees
01:20:26.32 --> 01:20:30.08 I don't remember hearing any the gun fire, but now the sounds began to register in my ears
01:20:30.08 --> 01:20:35.92 The two men who had stacked up directly behind me in my room clearing train where our Iraqi scouts
01:20:37.12 --> 01:20:40.40 The second man in our train took around to his chest plate and
01:20:40.80 --> 01:20:44.80 An knocked him clear out to the foyer. Ironically that round may have saved his life
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:50.08 He'd originally been with an arms length behind me as we'd entered the room the third man in my stack
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:56.24 Had been shot as he entered the room an AK 47 rounds smashed through his bulletproof chest plate
01:20:56.24 --> 01:20:58.24 He'd fallen dead in the doorway
01:20:58.24 --> 01:21:05.92 The chance factor was insane once fired a bullet can be unpredictable the internal milling of a gun's barrel causes bullets to
01:21:05.92 --> 01:21:13.20 Spin and flight some bullets will begin to tumble through the air at low speeds while others are designed to tumble in cartwheel after hitting a target
01:21:13.60 --> 01:21:15.60 Which can cause some brutal damage
01:21:16.24 --> 01:21:21.20 It's likely that we were all hit by the same type of bullets at nearly the same time shot from the same gun
01:21:21.60 --> 01:21:26.96 But the damage to each of us was significantly different a balance of my room clearing train five or six other guys
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:30.80 hadn't been able to get in the room because of all the volume of fire
01:21:33.36 --> 01:21:35.36 I moved from my knees and stood to my feet
01:21:37.44 --> 01:21:43.52 I felt like there were 200 pounds on my back. I took off my helmet and used the white light on my damage pistol to survey the room
01:21:43.68 --> 01:21:48.96 One of our other Iraqi scouts entered the room. He had been behind Clarkey and followed him into his room
01:21:48.96 --> 01:21:53.52 The bullet that hit Clark bypassed all three of the Iraqi scouts stacked up behind him
01:21:53.52 --> 01:21:59.52 These three made into Clarkey's room and a gotten trapped in the back of the house when the shooting started
01:21:59.52 --> 01:22:06.64 The scout had been part of the original group of ten recruits who had been with us since the first day. He spoke decent English and gave me a report
01:22:10.40 --> 01:22:12.40 One seal killed an action
01:22:12.40 --> 01:22:24.88 One Iraqi scout killed an action two detainees and six women and children
01:22:26.72 --> 01:22:29.20 At this point I actually didn't realize that they had left
01:22:31.20 --> 01:22:33.20 It didn't register yet
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:41.68 We started getting reports about what had happened during this
01:22:43.36 --> 01:22:46.48 I just remember thinking this is just
01:22:47.36 --> 01:22:49.36 This is just a pure insanity
01:22:51.36 --> 01:22:53.36 A lot of guys felt guilty for leaving me in there
01:22:53.36 --> 01:22:58.40 But I had to talk to a lot of guys like we didn't do anything wrong that
01:22:58.40 --> 01:23:02.56 Nobody saw me going there you guys followed protocol that we would always follow
01:23:04.08 --> 01:23:07.68 You didn't blow up the house because you didn't have a full head count did that right
01:23:08.64 --> 01:23:10.64 You know so everybody did everything right and
01:23:11.52 --> 01:23:15.68 I don't know I in a study sometimes with a knee jerk reactions that we would have to
01:23:17.36 --> 01:23:22.56 Try to make everything as safe as possible which we're good at but even if you do something
01:23:22.56 --> 01:23:27.76 Everything's right bad things can happen you just can't you know
01:23:28.48 --> 01:23:36.96 Can't minimize all the threats to the point where there's no more threat you just can't do it and you can also do really dumb things and make big mistakes and everything turns out perfect
01:23:37.04 --> 01:23:39.60 You know and you can do everything perfectly things go wrong
01:23:40.32 --> 01:23:42.48 Perfect plan goes to shit in the first 30 seconds right
01:23:47.04 --> 01:23:49.04 Rewinded a little bit this is what you said
01:23:49.04 --> 01:23:56.24 It was surreal like something out of a movie time slowed down almost to a stop and everything happened in super slow motion
01:23:56.64 --> 01:23:59.84 Almost as if I were watching a scene unfold frame by frame
01:24:00.24 --> 01:24:03.92 Second scene like minutes a slow motion torn a bullets flew at me
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:07.04 I could clearly see all the bullets coming at me
01:24:07.44 --> 01:24:10.64 I had total auditory exclusion there were no sounds
01:24:10.64 --> 01:24:15.52 I'd never been shot before so I had no idea how it felt in this strange slow motion scene
01:24:15.52 --> 01:24:20.32 I had a mental conversation with myself hey am I actually getting shot right now?
01:24:20.88 --> 01:24:26.40 It occurred to me that those sledjammers smashing all of my body will bullets hitting me one after another
01:24:27.36 --> 01:24:32.40 It was in this moment that I said my first real prayer God please get me home to my girls
01:24:32.96 --> 01:24:36.56 My wife and two young daughters were halfway around the world in that instant
01:24:37.12 --> 01:24:39.12 I felt them and they felt me
01:24:40.56 --> 01:24:44.88 I felt like a bullet dodging character in the movie the matrix only it wasn't dodging any of the bullets
01:24:44.88 --> 01:24:48.08 They were hitting me my rifle shot out of my hands
01:24:48.80 --> 01:24:54.96 bullets whizzing past my head hammered into the men entering the room behind me even as I continued to penetrate down the left wall
01:24:54.96 --> 01:25:02.24 Nobody else in my train would be able to make entry as all four of the enemy continued to fire directly into what is known as the fatal funnel
01:25:04.08 --> 01:25:07.76 The dimly lit doorway in which I was standing
01:25:07.76 --> 01:25:15.36 The enemy bullets triggered my rage and drove me to act it was then that my body became
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:23.44 Became my mind and took over I suppose that's what habit is when somebody when the body over rides the mind and acts without specific
01:25:23.44 --> 01:25:28.88 Instructions from the brain my right hand instinctively reached down from my secondary weapon epistol
01:25:28.88 --> 01:25:34.96 My hand was on autopilot as unhooked the rubber strap I'd fastening to keep my pistol secure and with a fluid push
01:25:34.96 --> 01:25:42.000 Food forward push and pull very same motion. I had done a hundred thousand times in training my weapon release from my holster
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.44 I aim my pistol engaged the enemy fighter directly opposite me down the left wall. He was glaring at me with his weapon throwing rounds directly at me
01:25:49.44 --> 01:25:54.16 I returned fire four or five rounds from my weapon in caught him in the face and chest as he stared at me
01:25:54.16 --> 01:26:02.000 His head jilted back. I saw the life leave his eyes like a light going off. I knew he was dead as he melted into a pile in front of me
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.24 I landed next to the dead man on my left years of training and muscle memory without any direct orders from my brain
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:12.24 Lifted my arm arched it and aim my pistol at a young male figure
01:26:12.48 --> 01:26:20.72 Maybe in his early 20s as he stood up and moved toward the doorway. I was still on the floor when I watched him pull a hand grenade from the front of his vest and pulled a pin
01:26:21.68 --> 01:26:29.36 My right hand pointed at him my index finger squeeze the trigger. I saw the bullets exit my pistol and spin clockwise as they flew toward him
01:26:29.36 --> 01:26:36.48 Leaving a green vapor trail in their wake. I watched my bullets punch into one side of his head and exhaust a blood and brain
01:26:36.48 --> 01:26:38.56 Matter instantly exiting out the other side
01:26:38.56 --> 01:26:44.88 I shot him dead as he attempted to sue his side mission to run out in the four-year with a live grenade where my fellow seals and Iraqi
01:26:44.88 --> 01:26:47.36 Scouts had stacked up attempting to enter the room
01:26:47.36 --> 01:26:58.80 My rounds drop them in his tracks as he fell forward. I saw the grenade release from his hand and rolled toward me then it detonated
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:10.88 This is crazy one of our newly arrived seals from team 10 so these are the guys that just showed up this probably this kid's first op
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:14.40 Yeah, but he was he was to pull to him. Oh, okay, so he was good to go
01:27:14.40 --> 01:27:16.40 One of the newly arrived
01:27:16.40 --> 01:27:19.40 First night the still in the first night
01:27:20.88 --> 01:27:27.84 One of the newly arrived seals from team 10 was outside under the carport looking into the rooms only window when he saw my bullets enter the enemies head
01:27:27.84 --> 01:27:33.76 He watched as the enemy fell the ensuing grenade blast shattered the window sprang shards of glass into my teammates face
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.84 This was his first mission on Iraq a new way to stop great-day and wait and start a new job
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:44.16 Grenade blast knocked me unconscious when I woke a few minutes later
01:27:44.16 --> 01:27:51.76 I was fully lucid and lying on my left side looking across the room at two men both were firing their weapons over my head out the window directly above me
01:27:52.76 --> 01:27:57.36 The grenade blast had twisted my helmet rendering my night vision goggles unusable
01:27:58.12 --> 01:28:05.04 The light from their muzzle flashes and the dim glow of the gas lamp and the foyer were enough to clearly illuminate the men standing no more than 10 feet away from me
01:28:05.04 --> 01:28:10.40 I heard no sounds it was totally silent. I was in a very bad place in the middle of a gun flight
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:18.92 If the enemy caught a glimpse of me glaring up at them all it would take for them to finish me off with both of them to point down pull their triggers and unload high velocity bullets into me
01:28:20.08 --> 01:28:23.64 If I could clearly see them then they could see me too for an instant
01:28:23.64 --> 01:28:29.000 I thought about playing dead, but in that same millisecond before the thought could be fully evaluated
01:28:29.32 --> 01:28:31.32 My anger rejected it outright
01:28:31.32 --> 01:28:36.12 I'd never been so angry a feeling of determined ruthless rage
01:28:36.36 --> 01:28:44.32 It seemed to be stored up somewhere deep inside me and something just snapped in that moment my rage consumed me my world closed in and nothing else
01:28:44.32 --> 01:28:51.12 Matter to me, but destroying the two men standing still in front of me. I would fight back and kill them before they killed me
01:28:51.12 --> 01:29:03.000 Other crazy thing about this is there were some holes in me that don't line up like I could two holes in my back
01:29:05.60 --> 01:29:09.36 You think they shot you in your unconscious. That's the only thing I can come up with
01:29:10.56 --> 01:29:16.000 I had two rounds in my back that's shattered my right scapula and there's no holes in the body armor
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.96 So I think they took the pistol and shoved it in there and then they shot me twice in the butt
01:29:21.60 --> 01:29:27.40 On the way I got shot in the butt. It's someone stood over top of me. I don't know why they didn't put one in my head
01:29:27.72 --> 01:29:29.72 Should have looked at the helmet more
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:35.000 Maybe they tried to shoot me to head and the helmet just got in the way but
01:29:36.76 --> 01:29:38.76 This this round right here
01:29:38.76 --> 01:29:45.78 Four months after the incident this is around your wearing round your hatched. It's a non-milled round
01:29:45.78 --> 01:29:50.92 And I got shot in a butt with and I didn't know about it that it was still in me until I went to a
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:54.96 Procedure to get a stint pulled out of my bladder four or four and a half months later and
01:29:55.76 --> 01:29:59.78 They took an X ray of it and came back in X ray of tech was like hey, you know, there's a bullet in your head
01:30:00.04 --> 01:30:02.04 That's how I found this bullet
01:30:02.56 --> 01:30:06.28 But the way the hip is you know that that arch right there
01:30:06.28 --> 01:30:10.08 So it was right there and it
01:30:11.92 --> 01:30:16.72 From 2007 to like two years ago is in a chiropractor and he took some X-rays and it had moved
01:30:16.72 --> 01:30:22.60 Then he took a side profile and it was literally at the service of my stomach and then we had that some headaches cut it out
01:30:23.68 --> 01:30:26.04 We thought it was gonna take like five minutes. I'll show you the pictures
01:30:26.04 --> 01:30:36.68 God video of them cutting out in the back of the suburban. Oh, there you go proper dinner break proper surgery
01:30:38.28 --> 01:30:43.32 Going back to this I didn't know it at the time, but I was lying unconscious on the floor while I was lying on
01:30:43.32 --> 01:30:50.000 Conscious on the floor my CLT made to where outside the door of the room trying to get a shot at the enemy two of our Iraqi counterparts
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.20 Where the only eyes that saw me enter the room in the chaos that ensued they were unable to communicate my location to anyone
01:30:56.56 --> 01:31:01.64 The volume of fire coming from the room through the door and out of the window is so excessive that there was no way
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:06.80 Anyone else was getting into the room the team decided to pull everyone back and call an air strike to neutralize the target
01:31:08.08 --> 01:31:10.08 And me with it
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:18.28 As the team pulled back from the house Connor my other CLT made with shot and wounded by one of the two remaining enemy fighters firing over my head and out the window
01:31:18.28 --> 01:31:23.84 While I lay on the floor my teammates worked their radio is calling for the status of each other and what was going on in the house
01:31:23.84 --> 01:31:25.84 I heard nothing
01:31:27.36 --> 01:31:32.88 As the remaining elements of my assault team departed the house and moved to a safe dropping distance from the target
01:31:32.88 --> 01:31:39.04 I was lying on my left side with my pistol still in my right hand just like before my arm reached up and aimed at one of the men
01:31:39.32 --> 01:31:43.36 Standing in front of me and my finger pulled the trigger. I couldn't hear the gun fire
01:31:43.36 --> 01:31:50.16 But I felt my hand jump rounds exit my weapon and I watched the projectiles find slow motion as they punched into his body
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:57.16 The small holes burst open in the fabric of his shirt where my bullets entered his face contorted into a bizarre
01:31:57.44 --> 01:32:00.24 Combination of surprise and pain more surprised than pain
01:32:00.80 --> 01:32:06.84 Then less than five seconds. I ran a magazine dry completed a magazine change before the two enemy fighters figured out
01:32:06.84 --> 01:32:09.48 I was still alive and I was shooting back at them
01:32:09.48 --> 01:32:17.08 My bullets drew their gun fire away from my departing teammates their full attention and bullets were then directed back at me
01:32:25.40 --> 01:32:28.08 The enemy fighters were now both so close to me
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:32.72 I remember the stunned look on their faces as they pointed their weapons back at me and fired
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:39.80 Around from one of their AK-47 struck the bottom of my pistol and dislodged my guns magazine my pistol jammed
01:32:39.80 --> 01:32:46.64 And I felt the guns grip crumbled in my hand another enemy bullet sailed clear through the foot of my magazine
01:32:46.64 --> 01:32:47.28 I
01:32:47.28 --> 01:32:54.72 Open my hands slightly to release the shards of broken plastic that were once my pistol grips the grip seemed to absorb the shock
01:32:54.72 --> 01:32:56.12 Shattering like an armor plate
01:32:56.12 --> 01:33:02.20 I was fortunate to have this type of weapon any other model would have been smashed to bits or been shot out of my hands my
01:33:03.40 --> 01:33:06.44 Palmas now pressed against the guns internal springs
01:33:08.60 --> 01:33:13.16 The bullets that struck my pistol caused my weapon a malfunction. I squeezed the trigger but nothing happened
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:19.78 I quickly cleared the malfunction with the tap of a on the bottom of the magazine to firmly reinsert into the pistol
01:33:19.78 --> 01:33:25.42 A rack of the slide then squeezed the trigger. I had done this top rack bay malfunction drill so many times
01:33:25.42 --> 01:33:31.52 It had happened automatically all the while I was still being shot at from no more than 10 feet away
01:33:32.14 --> 01:33:38.58 An instant later well before the human brain could process what and how it had happened my hand aimed at the pistol at the other
01:33:38.58 --> 01:33:43.74 Man standing across for me my finger squeezed the trigger. I saw the rounds twisting as they
01:33:43.90 --> 01:33:48.62 Exited my pistol flying toward him and entering his body then around tunneled into his face
01:33:48.62 --> 01:33:55.58 I empty the magazine to both men as they crumbled in the floor in front of me
01:33:55.58 --> 01:34:02.68 I loaded my last magazine into my damaged pistol. I was lying on my left side leaning against the man who I had first shot when I entered the room
01:34:02.68 --> 01:34:10.60 I pushed myself up with one hand and reached behind with the other placing my pistol against my dead enemies motionless body and fired several more rounds
01:34:10.60 --> 01:34:19.20 Seconds later all four enemy fighters were silent. Their dead bodies lay in pools of their own blood and piles of spent bullet gazings
01:34:19.20 --> 01:34:24.34 A metallic odor filled flooded the room blood and urine leak from their bodies onto the floor
01:34:24.34 --> 01:34:25.88 I
01:34:25.88 --> 01:34:31.32 New I had been shot. I felt heavy like there was a few hundred pounds sitting on my back
01:34:32.20 --> 01:34:34.20 It was difficult to breathe
01:34:34.20 --> 01:34:40.52 The fight was not over and the worst battles were yet to come
01:34:49.28 --> 01:34:57.74 Crazy gunfight my left thumb was a much shot off to get I had around go through this this joint right here
01:34:57.74 --> 01:35:05.20 When I I didn't figure it out until later after I got up and walked around tried to take my gloves off
01:35:06.20 --> 01:35:13.08 But I put that pistol in this left hand and reached out and shot so we've like this my thumb is like
01:35:13.08 --> 01:35:16.12 Almost hanging off the only thing was holding on was my glove
01:35:21.26 --> 01:35:24.30 I mean look how lucky. I don't know. Yeah, just won't bend
01:35:24.30 --> 01:35:26.30 Crazy
01:35:28.30 --> 01:35:34.78 Yeah, the the weapon functioning. I mean you still have the magazine I did go back
01:35:35.90 --> 01:35:38.46 After about five months and I was like hey, I want that pistol
01:35:38.46 --> 01:35:41.18 You know we already cleaned it up and put it back in circulation
01:35:41.86 --> 01:35:46.66 So somebody else was using it. I was like I want that pistol. Did you ever get it? No
01:35:48.34 --> 01:35:51.34 Yeah, the I was thinking about this you know
01:35:51.34 --> 01:35:57.26 We started off when I started off. I'll talk about how you know you can get shot one person get shot one person
01:35:57.26 --> 01:36:00.30 Catch a little tiny piece of frag like the size of a freaking
01:36:01.38 --> 01:36:06.76 The size of a little pebble yeah and kill them. Yeah, you popped up for more lottery or you
01:36:07.42 --> 01:36:10.38 Pop-guarder up here. That's what happened Clark we had one around
01:36:11.98 --> 01:36:13.98 Basically just go right through his neck right here. I
01:36:15.02 --> 01:36:17.02 Was just hit that already
01:36:17.02 --> 01:36:21.18 It was quick when I found him you stopped a smile on his face
01:36:22.14 --> 01:36:24.14 Sitting up right position
01:36:24.14 --> 01:36:26.14 And he was 27 years old at
01:36:27.50 --> 01:36:29.50 Got a shirt on
01:36:31.98 --> 01:36:33.98 Okay, it was his second deployment
01:36:37.66 --> 01:36:39.66 Yeah
01:36:39.66 --> 01:36:41.66 I
01:36:42.86 --> 01:36:49.58 Need to secure the building myself so I moved to the foyer with its glowing lamp and then to the room directly beside where my gunfight had happened
01:36:50.38 --> 01:36:53.82 There were six women and children all sitting in the far corner screaming and crying
01:36:53.82 --> 01:36:57.02 I pointed my white light at them and yelled shut up
01:36:58.46 --> 01:37:01.18 None of them spoke English, but they all became silent
01:37:03.82 --> 01:37:05.82 That's also the room where I found Clarky
01:37:05.82 --> 01:37:15.42 He was just inside the doorway sitting down with both legs spread out in front of him resting upright and leaning back slightly on his rucksack
01:37:19.02 --> 01:37:23.42 Clarky's trademark smirk was frozen on his face with his lips curled in a smile
01:37:25.10 --> 01:37:29.66 He looks so peaceful he'd been killed instantly by around that he'd come out of my room
01:37:29.66 --> 01:37:34.86 I tried to move him from the view of the front door, but he was too heavy
01:37:38.30 --> 01:37:40.94 Clark shredder was 27 years old
01:37:42.06 --> 01:37:49.58 He would take over a decade for the magnitude of Clark's death the penetrate me my tears now are often spontaneous triggered by a fleeting memory
01:37:49.90 --> 01:37:52.78 A mixture of accumulated losses or just a random thought
01:37:52.78 --> 01:37:58.06 At that moment though, I couldn't stop and grieve over Clarky
01:37:58.06 --> 01:38:00.86 I needed to secure the building and protect my teammates
01:38:04.30 --> 01:38:10.38 In another room in the back of the compound I found two enemy detainees are Iraqi scouts have made entry into this room
01:38:10.38 --> 01:38:15.82 Discovered the men and cough them. I checked their flecks coughs and put one of our Iraqi scouts in place to guard them
01:38:15.82 --> 01:38:23.98 I positioned our other Iraqi scouts at the front entry with specific orders to shoot anyone who tried to come into the house. I knew that I was shot up
01:38:23.98 --> 01:38:30.78 I walked around and cleared the house with my damaged pistol each time I turned my head I could feel my radio earpiece snag on my body armor
01:38:31.98 --> 01:38:37.02 I plugged my earbud in and keyed the radio to ask for a status in the house, but no, but my radio had been shot
01:38:37.50 --> 01:38:43.90 It's still at a tone, but no signal my radio is smashed. I needed to contact the team. I tried to swap out my radio with Clarky's
01:38:43.90 --> 01:38:50.94 But my gloves were slippery from all the blood. I just started to pull off my left hand glove when I saw that my thumb was barely attached to my hand
01:38:50.94 --> 01:38:52.94 It flopped into my palm
01:38:52.94 --> 01:38:57.42 There was a bullet hole through the glove. I must have been shot the thumb when the enemy shot at my pistol
01:38:57.42 --> 01:38:59.42 Discourrent destroying my gun's grips
01:38:59.98 --> 01:39:04.30 I decided to leave my gloves on eventually I managed to switch out my radio for Clarky's
01:39:04.30 --> 01:39:09.82 I moved back into the room where my gunfight had happened. I felt safer there as I knew everyone and it was dead
01:39:09.82 --> 01:39:15.98 It was there that I made radio contact with the rest of the team. Hey, this is Mike
01:39:16.54 --> 01:39:19.02 I'm still in the house. It's secure
01:39:19.74 --> 01:39:23.82 We've got four enemy killed an action one-eye racky scout killed an action
01:39:25.18 --> 01:39:27.18 one-seal killed an action
01:39:28.38 --> 01:39:30.38 two detainees
01:39:30.38 --> 01:39:38.30 six women and children
01:39:41.42 --> 01:39:42.94 Man
01:39:43.34 --> 01:39:44.54 They call the cure after that night
01:39:45.74 --> 01:39:49.18 Took them hour and 15 minutes to go like five miles
01:39:51.74 --> 01:39:55.34 Five miles. When did they activate the cure after when they probably when they started back and out of the house?
01:39:55.34 --> 01:40:00.62 Uh, we always initiate the cure after soon as gunfight
01:40:01.18 --> 01:40:04.70 Started as soon as there was a tech we would initiate cure after
01:40:06.14 --> 01:40:08.54 So they would get ready and then we could launch them
01:40:09.90 --> 01:40:12.46 But I mean that that area was so
01:40:13.26 --> 01:40:16.70 We went after this target one other time we got ID it on the way in yeah and
01:40:17.58 --> 01:40:20.30 Those are some of the cool details that you put in the book which
01:40:20.30 --> 01:40:25.34 Like I said that's why people have to buy the book if they want to want to get the rest of it because the background behind it
01:40:25.34 --> 01:40:30.06 You know you explained the efforts that you guys had made to hit this target and it was a terrible area
01:40:30.14 --> 01:40:35.74 Pretty much one way in when we out unless you wanted to do like an extra 75 kilometers to get and then
01:40:36.38 --> 01:40:38.38 If you didn't get lost back there
01:40:38.62 --> 01:40:40.62 Because I mean the map's weren't accurate
01:40:42.46 --> 01:40:46.94 I mean your greatest threat over there wasn't getting until it gunfight it was going to and from now
01:40:46.94 --> 01:40:49.66 It was your biggest threat we got ID and I think you're
01:40:51.50 --> 01:40:53.50 Six times on that deployment and
01:40:54.06 --> 01:40:57.98 You know when that when that happens over and over again they start looking who's here every time
01:40:57.98 --> 01:41:02.38 And I was one of the guys, okay, Mike's from possible one of the two possible ID magnets
01:41:03.26 --> 01:41:08.70 Because every time we get ID one of you two is there or both here there actually we were both there for all of them so
01:41:10.38 --> 01:41:14.30 How big how many seals did you have with you how many seals were on this op?
01:41:14.30 --> 01:41:18.94 I know real force we could take a little bit more if we had birds but
01:41:20.30 --> 01:41:27.18 A normal force and a half of it had to be a rackies and we don't give them mods and radio so you have to make
01:41:28.94 --> 01:41:31.18 Corrections for that like we have to drive the vehicles
01:41:33.02 --> 01:41:36.62 So it'd be like 20 guys but that would include a turp
01:41:37.34 --> 01:41:39.34 You know half a rocket force
01:41:39.34 --> 01:41:45.34 Occasionally brought this marine had a dog that never found anything but a pistol holster
01:41:48.46 --> 01:41:51.98 He did say that dog might have got baked in the car and it gets warm out there
01:41:52.70 --> 01:41:59.42 Yeah, like 22 but we we go out with six on these. There's only four seats and well five and you got the gunner, but the way we work
01:42:01.18 --> 01:42:02.86 Six people in a vehicle you're only getting
01:42:02.86 --> 01:42:08.54 Four people that are actually gonna work maybe three inside yeah, so I
01:42:09.82 --> 01:42:11.82 Have worked with other units where they leave
01:42:12.54 --> 01:42:15.42 Everybody gets out of the vehicle on the way the counter stays. I think like
01:42:18.30 --> 01:42:20.30 Say he does that
01:42:20.94 --> 01:42:22.94 We don't like that plan the
01:42:23.90 --> 01:42:30.54 Man for you to like just go back into full on team guy mode of okay here's what's going on
01:42:30.54 --> 01:42:39.10 I'm shot up. I got to finish clearing this house by myself get the house cleared doing assessment set security and then
01:42:39.98 --> 01:42:43.42 Contact the team and say hey, it's Mike
01:42:44.46 --> 01:42:46.46 Target secure
01:42:49.90 --> 01:42:51.90 Damn
01:42:51.90 --> 01:42:53.90 I don't believe it
01:42:53.90 --> 01:42:59.74 Freaking legit, man. I was definitely in shock. I did miss a room. I missed the stairs upstairs
01:42:59.74 --> 01:43:04.70 To the prayer room upstairs so they had to clear that I missed it
01:43:06.70 --> 01:43:08.94 But I decomplected the front door they came in they were
01:43:09.50 --> 01:43:15.58 Reclear the house because I pulled the guy off the front door that I told she'd anybody that came through because they were taken fire from me outside
01:43:16.30 --> 01:43:18.62 You know when when the neighbors know that you're there
01:43:19.66 --> 01:43:21.66 Some people like to shoot at the window at you
01:43:22.54 --> 01:43:25.10 Which was a lesson that we learned early on because
01:43:25.90 --> 01:43:27.90 Who doesn't like the blow up a door
01:43:27.90 --> 01:43:33.50 With sometimes you don't have to blow it up sometimes just turn it door knob sometimes that door knob works
01:43:34.30 --> 01:43:37.18 And when you blow up a door that the whole neighborhood knows you're there
01:43:38.30 --> 01:43:40.30 People take pop shots at you
01:43:42.54 --> 01:43:44.54 Freaking awesome, man
01:43:44.54 --> 01:43:46.54 Awesome work
01:43:47.58 --> 01:43:51.18 I also got a K round this before I got the idea for this necklace
01:43:51.18 --> 01:43:57.82 The guys found when they took my body armor and they came around fell out of it and it's slightly flat on one side
01:43:59.18 --> 01:44:03.34 And it's got rifling on it so that's how you know that it actually came through a rifle barrel
01:44:05.26 --> 01:44:07.26 But that one hit me inside a ten feet and
01:44:08.30 --> 01:44:13.50 It's completely intact. I mean it's like barely flat on one side. I can't explain that one either
01:44:14.78 --> 01:44:17.26 But I did get shot in the right places like
01:44:17.26 --> 01:44:26.78 I know guys it got shot in a femur. You hit bone it changes everything and I only had two bones hit my left thumb and my right scapula
01:44:29.10 --> 01:44:31.74 I did have a round go up in inside of my right thigh
01:44:32.70 --> 01:44:36.86 Which is probably the one the doctors are the most amazed about because if you know about
01:44:37.90 --> 01:44:42.38 The kinetic energy it's not energy that's being pushed in front of a bullet. It's what's being pulled
01:44:42.38 --> 01:44:48.38 And all the cavitation and how it ruptures organs and ruptures blood vessels and arteries
01:44:48.94 --> 01:44:50.94 That should have popped my femur artery
01:44:51.98 --> 01:44:56.62 Because that ran from my knee right above my knee all the way up to my inner thigh
01:44:57.90 --> 01:44:59.90 And that was definitely an AK round because
01:45:01.18 --> 01:45:03.18 The whole my leg
01:45:03.18 --> 01:45:05.90 It looked like someone took a cookie cutter of an AK round and
01:45:07.18 --> 01:45:11.34 Cut it out and the gunshot wounds healed weird
01:45:11.34 --> 01:45:15.82 They started off small and then they got bigger as a healed and then they shrunk
01:45:17.18 --> 01:45:19.18 I didn't have any bad exit wounds
01:45:20.54 --> 01:45:22.54 Everything went through me
01:45:22.94 --> 01:45:25.58 I got a bad exit wound out of my right arm pit that blew out
01:45:28.70 --> 01:45:32.86 But it's kind of actually hard you know I'm claiming 27 and it's the best of the technology
01:45:33.74 --> 01:45:37.58 But you know the one that went through my left thigh might have been the same one that went through my scrote
01:45:37.58 --> 01:45:39.58 I don't know
01:45:39.58 --> 01:45:43.10 But I'm not gonna ruin a good story. Hey bro. I say we're round up
01:45:44.86 --> 01:45:46.86 And honestly those ones I hit the body armor
01:45:48.62 --> 01:45:50.62 I was more aware the ones at the body armor
01:45:51.34 --> 01:45:56.06 I had no idea where I was I been shot until I pulled my glove off. I knew I've been shot in the chest and back
01:45:56.62 --> 01:46:00.14 I could feel it. I mean I had I had a bunch of broken ribs
01:46:01.34 --> 01:46:02.62 Um
01:46:02.62 --> 01:46:06.94 And I had a contention on my right long so when I when I called those guys I was like you guys get a hurry up
01:46:06.94 --> 01:46:11.90 I can't breathe. I think I got a sucking chest wound. You know they pulled my body armor off and there's two holes in my back
01:46:13.26 --> 01:46:16.30 And they tried to get a bit of a reclusive dressing on it
01:46:17.34 --> 01:46:19.58 an old one that we used to use and they couldn't get it to stick
01:46:20.54 --> 01:46:22.14 so
01:46:22.14 --> 01:46:24.14 Luckily it wasn't a sucking chest wound
01:46:27.02 --> 01:46:30.70 Yeah, and you got shot with green tip too, right? Yeah, and
01:46:31.90 --> 01:46:33.58 They took my body armor
01:46:33.58 --> 01:46:37.90 After that whatever company does the investigation and they took it apart layer by layer
01:46:38.54 --> 01:46:43.90 So the other layer body armor spawning it's that black stuff it kind of looks I don't know how to just
01:46:44.54 --> 01:46:47.82 It's to stuff the holes everything together so it's a ceramic plate there's multiple layers
01:46:49.18 --> 01:46:54.38 And plus I had to carry her on and at that time we were doing the soft armor hard armor before alpha with a soft
01:46:56.38 --> 01:46:58.38 I can't imagine
01:46:58.86 --> 01:47:00.86 Getting shot in the chest
01:47:00.86 --> 01:47:05.66 With standalone for alpha armor piercing protection without that soft armor
01:47:06.06 --> 01:47:07.82 It's gonna break everyone in your damn ribs
01:47:08.70 --> 01:47:12.38 Every damn one I only had I think four broken ribs
01:47:13.90 --> 01:47:15.90 I mean you
01:47:15.90 --> 01:47:22.30 These just so you pop a rib out of you once a lot of sucks it's freaking horrible man you get that that top of your breath and you can't
01:47:23.18 --> 01:47:27.10 Someone stab at me. No, you don't want anyone to make you laugh or cough or anything like that
01:47:27.10 --> 01:47:31.26 But yeah, the weird thing about green tip is that if you don't know anything about it
01:47:31.26 --> 01:47:36.22 I'm trying to trade it more through the body armor than they caked it. Oh, I totally believe that
01:47:36.22 --> 01:47:38.22 It's a green tip is American and
01:47:39.02 --> 01:47:43.90 And five five six five five six what kind of the standard round for America?
01:47:43.90 --> 01:47:47.90 We got a bunch of other ones. I know but green tip is kind of the standard
01:47:48.46 --> 01:47:53.58 Round for let's say an army infantry unit and so you might wonder
01:47:53.58 --> 01:48:02.94 How does Mike end up with green tip and his body or his body armor and the answer is they recover the weapon and yeah, there was this
01:48:04.06 --> 01:48:06.06 All this guy's equipment to include his name
01:48:07.26 --> 01:48:13.58 his LBE is a little bearing equipment with his magazines and it still had his name on it that his night vision goggles
01:48:14.30 --> 01:48:16.30 That is pistol
01:48:16.70 --> 01:48:19.74 That a bunch of these guys stuff and it was from what we figured out
01:48:19.74 --> 01:48:22.78 Ambushed out in the body
01:48:23.74 --> 01:48:26.94 Army unit in the body so an army unit in the body got ambushed
01:48:27.42 --> 01:48:32.54 They captured this guy's equipment and then they put it to use and they put it to use on you man and the green tip
01:48:33.82 --> 01:48:37.26 Was the only one that penetrated through the plate and
01:48:38.14 --> 01:48:42.86 Made entry into the soft armor it got about halfway through all the plies on the soft armor
01:48:42.86 --> 01:48:49.74 You mentioned the green tip like that it's standard but what special about green tip is the
01:48:49.74 --> 01:48:51.74 What's it's five six?
01:48:51.74 --> 01:48:56.06 It's the standard ammunition that we use it's we had a lot of problems with it in
01:48:57.42 --> 01:48:58.78 different
01:48:58.78 --> 01:49:00.78 different places like Somalia
01:49:02.78 --> 01:49:07.90 What a terrible place to there is you women and children in shields, but the green tip was such a hot round
01:49:07.90 --> 01:49:13.82 Meaning hot, it's the move so fast that sometimes it just goes right through people and it doesn't
01:49:14.54 --> 01:49:17.82 Doesn't get the a lot of damage from bullet happens
01:49:18.30 --> 01:49:22.70 After it passes through and it's the cavitation and the cavity it creates behind it
01:49:23.34 --> 01:49:25.34 It's really not what it does in front of it
01:49:28.62 --> 01:49:32.62 But the green tip so fast it doesn't create that cavitation it just cuts through stuff
01:49:32.62 --> 01:49:37.90 But it's also it's a repair thing, right? Yeah, it's it's fast and it's small
01:49:38.70 --> 01:49:45.58 So if it's and it's made it is yeah, it punches through armor a lot as you know this it's not it's not supposed to punch through for a
01:49:45.66 --> 01:49:52.14 Yeah, well, who knows when I got hit with the green tip because I had three rounds in the chest and if you look at the body armor
01:49:52.14 --> 01:49:54.14 It's already
01:49:54.14 --> 01:49:56.14 It aggregates with each one
01:49:56.14 --> 01:49:59.58 They they they're only going to say yeah, this will save you from one round
01:49:59.58 --> 01:50:02.54 Yeah, that's what they'll tell you after that we don't know what that what's gonna do
01:50:03.58 --> 01:50:07.50 Because if it I mean if you get if you take one and the tenering
01:50:07.74 --> 01:50:11.82 Yeah, and that damage is everything. Oh, maybe that does more damage
01:50:12.22 --> 01:50:15.74 equally all the way around but I got hit like here here and here
01:50:16.94 --> 01:50:17.98 Uh
01:50:18.30 --> 01:50:22.30 And maybe the green tip wasn't the first one well, maybe it was the first one
01:50:22.94 --> 01:50:26.06 Before the AK hit it before it was so aggregated that it was useless
01:50:26.06 --> 01:50:29.90 I don't know what's in front of my face and like she died mill into it all day
01:50:30.78 --> 01:50:32.78 Doesn't make it net and doesn't make it dead
01:50:33.50 --> 01:50:39.98 You can barely find the dent from a nine mill and that stuff. Yeah, I mean this was just a lot weaker than rifles are and then
01:50:40.38 --> 01:50:43.42 Yeah, have that argument to what round or shot placement
01:50:43.82 --> 01:50:46.70 Well, I'm shot placement you're all shot placement
01:50:46.70 --> 01:50:49.74 Yeah, and if you're not good at shot placement then just put a lot there
01:50:51.02 --> 01:50:53.02 You know can't tie knots tie a lot
01:50:53.02 --> 01:50:55.58 Yeah, what a doubt overload
01:50:57.02 --> 01:50:58.02 Uh
01:50:58.02 --> 01:51:03.18 Going back to the book 15 minute minutes after I'd called the team to let them know I'd been shot the MetaVac landed
01:51:03.98 --> 01:51:05.66 I had to say that because that's freaking awesome
01:51:06.14 --> 01:51:11.58 Jack asked if I need any help as we walk together to the bird about 150 yards and all I felt heavy and slow as we walked together
01:51:11.58 --> 01:51:15.58 Over the freshly plowed field I put my left arm over his shoulder to steady myself as I moved
01:51:15.90 --> 01:51:18.22 Jack instinctively reached up and grab my hand
01:51:18.46 --> 01:51:21.50 Which almost ripped off my dangling thumb jack like oh my thumb
01:51:21.50 --> 01:51:28.54 Conner my seal teammate who was wounded in the arm exiting the house jumped on the bird for the short flight to the hospital and Baghdad
01:51:28.86 --> 01:51:32.86 He was another one of our team's medics and I thought he that's why he was with me
01:51:33.18 --> 01:51:38.50 I didn't know that he had been shot until we were in the hospital together and Bethesda Maryland. That was me
01:51:38.50 --> 01:51:40.50 Yeah, it was first deployed
01:51:42.38 --> 01:51:46.86 The flight medic was very efficient crawling all over me to cut off my clothes and gear to get to my wounds and
01:51:46.86 --> 01:51:52.62 Serting his knee into every bullet hole in the process and his defense. There wasn't much he could touch that didn't have a bullet hole
01:51:53.26 --> 01:51:55.26 Punched out of it
01:51:56.14 --> 01:52:00.54 My seal teammate Chris Till had been assigned as my casualty assistant's officer and
01:52:00.94 --> 01:52:06.22 Would accompany me all the way back home Chris was standing next to me with a satellite phone
01:52:06.22 --> 01:52:13.10 You have to call your wife he said I refused it first, but then I remembered that my next of kin must be notified within 24 hours of an incident
01:52:13.10 --> 01:52:17.34 Brande was back in Virginia Beach shopping with the girls when chansored
01:52:18.78 --> 01:52:24.46 Hey, I said I don't have a lot of time. I'm coming home early. I got shot, but I'm fine
01:52:24.46 --> 01:52:30.30 I've got all my limbs my face is fine and the doctor said I'm going to make a hundred percent recovery. I'll see you soon
01:52:31.58 --> 01:52:35.82 I had to phone back to Chris and the medical team stacked me on the plane
01:52:35.82 --> 01:52:41.66 I must have passed out because my next memory is waking up in the United States at Naval Medical Center
01:52:41.66 --> 01:52:43.66 Bethesda, Maryland
01:52:45.10 --> 01:52:48.30 Talk to good 50 people that talked to me in launch still
01:52:51.02 --> 01:52:53.02 Don't remember don't remember
01:52:53.90 --> 01:53:03.26 Yeah, I be one of those people is was was Admiral Craven. Yes, so that's cool and and you guys knew each other from team three
01:53:03.66 --> 01:53:06.78 Yeah, I was in my first three commanding officers were
01:53:06.78 --> 01:53:10.30 McTime, McNally and McRaven
01:53:11.82 --> 01:53:13.82 Three three mix
01:53:14.94 --> 01:53:21.26 Yeah, you do you do that and and you you talk about that visit from from the Admiral again
01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:24.94 Well, that was from I think I did some play-dories
01:53:25.58 --> 01:53:32.14 Pladurizing from his book. Yeah, you pull through he's got a book out called sea stories and it's one of the stories in his book is you know
01:53:32.14 --> 01:53:38.78 Visiting a guy that just been shot 27 times so there yeah, but yeah, you put it in this book as well
01:53:38.78 --> 01:53:43.42 He's a good dude. I mean yeah, some people might think he's got some sway political views right now, but
01:53:44.70 --> 01:53:48.30 You know, I watched him take care of people and that's kind of how I judge people
01:53:48.30 --> 01:53:52.46 Yeah, like if you care about people and you take care of him. Yeah, and you're not doing shit the
01:53:53.02 --> 01:53:54.54 feed your own
01:53:54.54 --> 01:53:56.54 ego your own agenda
01:53:56.54 --> 01:53:58.54 I mean you gotta have your own agenda. I got mine now
01:53:58.54 --> 01:54:02.78 I mean it's part of the reason why I sold the book. I want to go surfing all the time
01:54:05.18 --> 01:54:07.18 That's all I want to do
01:54:12.22 --> 01:54:14.62 Yeah, it's a it's a pretty interesting story. I
01:54:16.06 --> 01:54:17.50 Guess
01:54:17.50 --> 01:54:21.98 We have from your perspective blessed. I have this story and be able to talk about it. You know
01:54:22.86 --> 01:54:27.18 It's a very few people be able to pick this up and not find something in it that
01:54:27.18 --> 01:54:30.06 They're gonna be able to write to in their own life bro
01:54:32.62 --> 01:54:37.90 You got shot 27 times you know, and you did that job. I mean it's freaking that's a least interesting thing in the
01:54:37.90 --> 01:54:42.30 Yeah, but but just yeah, you put the whole story together and
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:47.82 Yeah, man, it's powerful and like you said there's all kinds of stuff for everybody and and
01:54:47.82 --> 01:54:54.14 And you all get into some of it, but a lot of it is is you trying to explain how you got through this stuff and you know
01:54:54.14 --> 01:54:59.18 How you got through your childhood trauma and what that trauma turns into and I'm gonna get into some of it
01:54:59.18 --> 01:55:06.06 But that's just a whole another reason but even if you're a hippie that doesn't want to read a single thing about war
01:55:07.02 --> 01:55:10.14 Go okay skip those parts because you're still gonna get something out of the rest of it
01:55:10.54 --> 01:55:16.38 Well my publisher we were working through this or like like does this say a navy seal book or a cell
01:55:16.38 --> 01:55:18.86 Pop book and I was like leave it in big was I don't care what you call it
01:55:18.86 --> 01:55:24.06 Care what you call it yeah, now now I'm doing pretty good in the
01:55:26.06 --> 01:55:28.06 The PTSD section
01:55:30.38 --> 01:55:36.46 Trail and after I'm traveling after you bring the pump in at your door. I have a PTSD
01:55:36.46 --> 01:55:40.94 There's a PTSD as no years years your books are number one and
01:55:42.62 --> 01:55:45.66 War biographies and okay your books do awesome
01:55:45.66 --> 01:55:52.46 How do I in the PTSD section? No, not PTSD as well and the PTSD section vanner coke
01:55:53.50 --> 01:55:57.34 Body keeps the score which is one. Okay, that's the book that you talk about yeah that's one of the
01:55:57.90 --> 01:55:59.90 Everybody's to read that book
01:56:02.14 --> 01:56:04.30 Couple things in there if you understand your trauma
01:56:05.74 --> 01:56:09.10 Your childhood trauma then your behaviors are predictable
01:56:10.22 --> 01:56:13.58 You know, so if you understand that you become the person
01:56:13.58 --> 01:56:19.98 That you're taught to be inferred and inside of the first seven years and you know what your reaction's gonna be to it
01:56:19.98 --> 01:56:23.74 Then it's predictable and then you can work on it. I might trigger is I don't like anybody
01:56:23.74 --> 01:56:27.74 Poked me in the chest and when I got scared I don't care
01:56:28.86 --> 01:56:30.86 Sometimes I might over
01:56:30.86 --> 01:56:32.86 Push back
01:56:32.86 --> 01:56:34.86 I don't like to be called names and
01:56:35.90 --> 01:56:40.14 I got cursed out by a little 20-year-old kid and starbucks a couple weeks ago
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:43.18 And I had to ask him I was like boy how old are you?
01:56:44.22 --> 01:56:47.34 He's like I'm 22 and this kid's flipping me off because I won't put out a mask
01:56:48.46 --> 01:56:51.18 And I was like you wouldn't be talking to me like this if we were outside
01:56:52.86 --> 01:56:57.26 But you know, I think that's a problem a lot of people in this world right now. You know the keyboard
01:56:58.94 --> 01:57:02.86 The keyboard bullies and they get behind the wheels of their car and I like a bunch of assholes
01:57:02.86 --> 01:57:04.22 I you know a lot of people just
01:57:04.22 --> 01:57:09.90 Don't know that if if you could get punched in the face for being as rude as you are you wouldn't do it
01:57:12.30 --> 01:57:17.50 Yeah, we got a society. It's just so rude now. I'm that me every time you get in your car to them
01:57:17.50 --> 01:57:19.50 That's car raised people cutting you off and
01:57:21.50 --> 01:57:25.10 I mean, I've got I've kind of slowed down. I was that type of driver
01:57:26.54 --> 01:57:29.34 Then I rushed to get everywhere even though I didn't have a schedule
01:57:29.34 --> 01:57:31.34 You
01:57:32.06 --> 01:57:37.10 You well, sir, you talk about like I said you talk about some of this trauma and whatnot
01:57:39.42 --> 01:57:44.30 And here's like here's like here's a little sample of sort of how you start looking at this stuff
01:57:44.30 --> 01:57:46.38 I would spend the next 18 months training guys
01:57:46.38 --> 01:57:48.70 Shuffling papers in a administrative duty at my new command
01:57:48.70 --> 01:57:51.98 So this is this is now your I think you're back at trade-it again, right?
01:57:51.98 --> 01:57:58.30 Yeah, I went back to work inside of five months about four and a five months and I was in that course that we talked about earlier that
01:57:58.30 --> 01:58:00.30 Communications course
01:58:00.70 --> 01:58:06.62 My physical physical medical my physical therapy team became an important part of my recovery in life
01:58:06.62 --> 01:58:11.58 My team was made up of doctors nurses physical therapist chiropractic inclinations who specialize in all type of care
01:58:12.06 --> 01:58:16.78 Most importantly this group understood seal culture seals tend toward the extreme
01:58:16.78 --> 01:58:19.90 We think if one repetition is good then 500 must be great
01:58:20.54 --> 01:58:25.66 I was blinded by my own bias and it wasn't the first time or the last one day long into my recovery
01:58:25.66 --> 01:58:32.06 I can find it to my nurse that I may have been experiencing symptoms related to PTSD post traumatic stress disorder
01:58:32.06 --> 01:58:37.82 I had been sitting in my truck listening to a radio talk show when the when the expert being interviewed began
01:58:37.82 --> 01:58:43.34 Describing the common symptoms of PTSD the voice spoken a calm matter of fact tone talking about the
01:58:44.62 --> 01:58:49.66 Autonomic nervous system and how sleeplessness constant irrational fears
01:58:49.66 --> 01:58:57.98 And hyper vigilance are often normal and predictable responses to trauma. I listened to a stranger's voice described me to me
01:58:58.86 --> 01:59:06.46 And I was both relieved and confused when I told the nurse who is a friend and someone I trusted she smiled and chuckled good to hear Mike
01:59:06.46 --> 01:59:09.50 We all thought that you actually enjoyed what happened to you in that room
01:59:10.14 --> 01:59:12.14 She seemed to understand
01:59:12.38 --> 01:59:14.38 That being profoundly
01:59:14.38 --> 01:59:23.18 Effected by my experience of war was normal and not being altered was abnormal. This was the first time that I considered the concept of emotional
01:59:23.58 --> 01:59:25.58 Invisible wounds and that I had them
01:59:26.30 --> 01:59:31.26 I have come to understand that if the experience of war does not profoundly alter you in some way
01:59:31.26 --> 01:59:35.74 Then you may actually have a problem when the doctor said that I had been perfectly wounded
01:59:35.90 --> 01:59:41.74 It seemed like a metaphor for my life. I had been beat up just enough not to kill me and through the process
01:59:41.74 --> 01:59:46.30 I earned the perfect scars of wisdom to survive my next thrashing
01:59:46.86 --> 01:59:53.34 I still had no idea how the events of my childhood influenced my thoughts and behavior. I'd become very good at compartmentalization
01:59:54.38 --> 02:00:01.58 My self-awareness grew as I uncovered layers of trauma. I later found that my childhood wounds had prepared me for a career in the seal teams
02:00:01.66 --> 02:00:04.30 But they also became a most haunting ones
02:00:05.18 --> 02:00:10.46 I romantly it took being shot 27 times to uncover my original wounds the ones
02:00:10.46 --> 02:00:13.34 That I never considered or knew I had
02:00:19.42 --> 02:00:22.38 Yeah, so you know you start looking at what's going on
02:00:23.74 --> 02:00:26.46 And this is this is cool. It's got to read this bro
02:00:27.10 --> 02:00:29.26 Because it's a one one page chapter
02:00:29.50 --> 02:00:35.74 Called the enemy within I fully accepted all the hazards of my chosen occupation being wounded was no big deal to me
02:00:35.74 --> 02:00:39.26 At no time during or after I was shot that I ever think I was going to die
02:00:39.26 --> 02:00:44.30 I was provided the best medical care available and was sure that my physical wounds would eventually heal
02:00:44.86 --> 02:00:48.78 The real battle began when I returned home the war and Iraq was straightforward
02:00:49.34 --> 02:00:54.70 I was expertly trained and had the unconditional support of a community of like-minded highly motivated professionals
02:00:55.18 --> 02:00:58.78 Professionals as a seal I'd been institutionalized in a sense
02:00:59.26 --> 02:01:02.14 I knew the culture the people the rules and the objective
02:01:03.34 --> 02:01:06.30 After leaving the military and returning home my life became a
02:01:06.30 --> 02:01:12.70 Confusing frustrating and stressful mess. I was a prisoner who had been released from the institution into a strange new world
02:01:13.02 --> 02:01:15.90 There was a distructful a distrustful cynic
02:01:16.38 --> 02:01:21.82 Slowly working his way inside me his voice sounded like my own and each day he became more convincing
02:01:22.14 --> 02:01:24.46 I was surrounded isolated and desperate
02:01:25.10 --> 02:01:30.54 This enemy knew all my weaknesses he was relentless and he eventually overpowered me
02:01:30.54 --> 02:01:37.26 This enemy was me
02:01:40.14 --> 02:01:42.94 So a couple things I want to say on the BTSD I
02:01:45.02 --> 02:01:47.50 At that point it really wasn't PTSD
02:01:48.38 --> 02:01:53.42 At least clinical because I haven't had any dreams about it. I don't mind talking about it
02:01:55.02 --> 02:01:57.02 It doesn't bother me
02:01:57.02 --> 02:02:00.70 It bothered more the people around me more than bothered me. It was more of a hindrance
02:02:01.50 --> 02:02:03.74 You know that that I had to live in a recliner for three months
02:02:04.54 --> 02:02:07.82 That bothered my kids because they'd never seem to get hurt sick
02:02:09.02 --> 02:02:11.02 Pretty much was my first injury
02:02:11.34 --> 02:02:13.66 Ever other than broken fingers and toes
02:02:14.22 --> 02:02:19.26 I did pinch up from moral nerve that put me down for about two three months at one point. I don't have a PT thing
02:02:20.94 --> 02:02:24.38 But I was really milding my first injury because the fingers and toes don't count
02:02:24.38 --> 02:02:26.38 I don't count
02:02:29.26 --> 02:02:32.86 But what had happened to me at this point
02:02:33.50 --> 02:02:40.22 Well, I want to talk about what I call false anxiety first just bad health eating terrible dehydration drinkin too much
02:02:42.06 --> 02:02:48.14 Your physiology when you're in that kind and that state of health feels like anxiety the increased heart rate
02:02:48.14 --> 02:02:55.42 The sweaty palms the whole physiology it goes along with anxiety because of bad health
02:02:55.90 --> 02:02:59.26 It's your physiology reacting to what you people are dumping in their bodies
02:03:00.14 --> 02:03:02.14 my particular issue and
02:03:02.86 --> 02:03:08.14 What I think health care should be is an individual evaluation of each person
02:03:08.94 --> 02:03:13.66 To adjust their medical care for for that because I watch for years people take medication
02:03:13.66 --> 02:03:19.18 for for migraine and then migraine doesn't go away, but they get another symptoms
02:03:19.18 --> 02:03:20.86 So here's another medication for the symptom
02:03:21.66 --> 02:03:24.38 Eight medications later the guys telling me
02:03:25.42 --> 02:03:29.02 I still got a migraine and I can't remember what I did 15 minutes ago. I'm taking eight meds for it
02:03:34.14 --> 02:03:36.14 I had
02:03:36.14 --> 02:03:41.66 In your stomach you have for a bacteria that breaks up the food so your intestines can take the
02:03:41.66 --> 02:03:46.46 Vitamins and nutrients in and I had no good floor in my stomach so my body
02:03:47.50 --> 02:03:53.26 Physiologically couldn't even break down the food so when I got tested my urine my stool my blood
02:03:54.14 --> 02:03:56.14 And they also used epigenetics
02:03:56.94 --> 02:04:03.74 Which says your epigenetics your genetics say that your body will consume and you utilize certain types of food
02:04:04.54 --> 02:04:06.14 Because of your genetics and where you're from
02:04:06.14 --> 02:04:11.18 I would see a lot of guys in the seal teams everybody's on keto well, how do you know keto is good for you?
02:04:11.98 --> 02:04:13.98 You might be hurt yourself or
02:04:14.62 --> 02:04:16.86 I had the Greek slip for a long time. I would see the Greek diet
02:04:17.42 --> 02:04:20.14 Might not be the one for you because your genetics don't
02:04:20.86 --> 02:04:23.26 I mean, it might work but it might not be the opin
02:04:26.06 --> 02:04:30.86 So I went on to fix mine all I had to do is take antibiotics for a week and then I rebuilt it with
02:04:30.86 --> 02:04:35.18 Diet you know just probiotics and
02:04:36.54 --> 02:04:43.50 This is to repair your gut floor after you did get tests. They study everything that's coming out of you they go. Oh, yeah, this is what you need
02:04:44.38 --> 02:04:50.06 So my body couldn't even give me this nutrients because it wasn't physiologically working and I was completely beat efficient
02:04:50.46 --> 02:04:51.66 Deed efficient
02:04:51.66 --> 02:04:53.26 had all kinds of
02:04:53.26 --> 02:04:55.26 spikes and heavy metals
02:04:55.26 --> 02:05:00.70 Where was this while you were still enter is this after you retired and you started working for the care coalition?
02:05:00.70 --> 02:05:02.86 It was when I was working for the care coalition
02:05:03.34 --> 02:05:08.70 I've been there for probably six little over six years so you retired in 2010
02:05:09.02 --> 02:05:13.10 Yeah, and where did you spend your last so this incident happened in 2000?
02:05:13.10 --> 02:05:20.30 Would you spend your last seven years at a debt little creek and you were so I taught that course got it and then I was the operations officer
02:05:20.30 --> 02:05:22.30 Which was the worst job ever
02:05:22.30 --> 02:05:27.82 And then you but so then you retire out of there and you get this job at the care coalition which is
02:05:28.38 --> 02:05:33.26 Special operations care coalition. Yeah, where where where are you located when you're doing that job?
02:05:33.26 --> 02:05:38.06 Well, I'm still living in Virginia Beach, but I'm just the job changed when I was initially
02:05:38.94 --> 02:05:41.66 hired for that job. I had all of the MSW Marseaux guys
02:05:42.62 --> 02:05:46.38 And that is wherever they were so Marseaux is on both coast
02:05:46.38 --> 02:05:54.22 So I'd go to Lissian once once a month. I'd flat the San Diego once a month. I'm hit the guys out there and a WM Marseaux
02:05:55.02 --> 02:05:57.02 And we were putting guys in
02:05:57.18 --> 02:06:02.22 If we could find a quality care that was sufficient we would put them somewhere
02:06:02.54 --> 02:06:07.10 You know where they were from so they can hang out with the family and so you're you're when you're in that job
02:06:07.10 --> 02:06:11.18 You're an advocate for all these wounded guys correct non medical case manager
02:06:11.18 --> 02:06:16.54 Non medical case manager going okay, and this guys this kid will tell you hey, you know
02:06:16.54 --> 02:06:22.54 I'm having problems with my ex girlfriend and we got to need to help with that or I mean just I need I want to get back home to my family or whatever
02:06:23.18 --> 02:06:26.54 Issues that they're facing is that right was I ran guys through their
02:06:27.02 --> 02:06:32.14 They were going through a medical retirement board. I was the advocate for that and I was the interface between
02:06:33.42 --> 02:06:35.42 them and
02:06:35.42 --> 02:06:37.42 And the pebble host
02:06:37.42 --> 02:06:43.74 Physical valuation board liaison officers which weren't really good and what they did
02:06:45.18 --> 02:06:47.18 So I did VA disability
02:06:47.18 --> 02:06:49.18 I did wellness trips
02:06:50.46 --> 02:06:53.98 There was a lot of care that you know, you know periplegic
02:06:55.10 --> 02:06:58.30 Doesn't care that it's a test a test medication or
02:06:58.94 --> 02:07:06.22 Test treatment they just want to walk again and you know sometimes our medical systems not gonna facilitate that so
02:07:06.22 --> 02:07:10.46 Others will so we would facilitate treatments outside of network
02:07:11.42 --> 02:07:16.62 So it's my job as I described it was to improve somebody's situation and
02:07:17.58 --> 02:07:22.54 I did everything from baby sippers for people to
02:07:22.54 --> 02:07:27.98 You know medical retirement boards. I mean, that was a better social worker than I was a seal
02:07:27.98 --> 02:07:36.22 You talk about some of the cases you talk about you talk you know you go through this
02:07:37.18 --> 02:07:39.02 You talk about some of the people that you helped out
02:07:40.46 --> 02:07:45.10 Holly was one of my first clients when I met her she was only able to lie in bed and screaming at the top of her lungs
02:07:45.10 --> 02:07:50.38 It was scary Holly was raised in port Angelys Washington and listed in the Navy after high school
02:07:50.38 --> 02:07:54.30 She joined the military to create a future for herself and her family when I met her
02:07:54.30 --> 02:07:56.62 She was still the bread winner for most of her family
02:07:56.62 --> 02:08:02.14 She had become an independent duty corpsman which is the highest and listed medical care provider in the Navy
02:08:02.30 --> 02:08:05.50 She graduated the program and become an Arabic linguist
02:08:06.14 --> 02:08:11.82 Hospital corpsman chief pedi officer Holly crab tree was assigned to work with a seal team as they conducted various
02:08:11.98 --> 02:08:13.98 Operations in Iraq
02:08:13.98 --> 02:08:15.18 It was April 15th
02:08:15.18 --> 02:08:19.82 2010. I just joined the care coalition and Holly was nearing the end of her deployment
02:08:20.22 --> 02:08:23.34 She was out doing a medical civilian affairs operation
02:08:23.34 --> 02:08:30.62 When she was shot the bullet pierced her helmet fractured a skull and settled behind her eye
02:08:30.70 --> 02:08:32.30 She was not expected to live
02:08:33.10 --> 02:08:37.90 Her crew realized that she was expecting and coded Holly's condition as
02:08:38.22 --> 02:08:40.22 Holt trauma
02:08:40.62 --> 02:08:42.62 She proved everybody wrong
02:08:42.62 --> 02:08:45.02 Holly would not give up or stop working
02:08:45.26 --> 02:08:50.06 She would have to relearn how to talk walk even swallow. I watched her do it all
02:08:50.06 --> 02:08:55.82 It was both sad and humbling but most of all it made me very proud to know her
02:08:56.70 --> 02:09:01.10 Holly since made an impressive recovery and is medically retired after 13 years of service
02:09:03.02 --> 02:09:05.34 Had another guy he's in there Sam
02:09:06.14 --> 02:09:08.14 Same thing shot in the same place
02:09:09.66 --> 02:09:14.38 Both both um did he have to relearn everything as well? Yeah, and they both stroked
02:09:14.38 --> 02:09:19.98 Paralyzed them on the right side of their body
02:09:21.58 --> 02:09:24.62 He's uh he's working in a program right now where he goes after
02:09:26.06 --> 02:09:30.54 Child pornographers and traffickers which is a huge problem in the country right now
02:09:32.38 --> 02:09:35.10 Like what 500,000 children go missing every year in this country
02:09:37.10 --> 02:09:40.46 That's insane. I mean, I'll show you real slavery that's happening right now
02:09:40.46 --> 02:09:42.46 Now
02:09:44.14 --> 02:09:52.30 As you're doing this stuff with other people this is when your starting to realize that you know you should get checked out yourself
02:09:52.46 --> 02:09:56.30 Am I getting that right like in the timeline like this is when you start going hey man. I should get these tests
02:09:57.58 --> 02:09:59.58 well
02:09:59.58 --> 02:10:02.78 The only reason I did these tests was because I was having issues and
02:10:03.90 --> 02:10:07.82 People around me like you're gonna go go get help go talk to somebody and I refuse to
02:10:07.82 --> 02:10:13.58 And the reason why I went with this doctor was because it was a leasonvasive and I'll have to do is talk to him on
02:10:14.94 --> 02:10:16.94 Skype
02:10:16.94 --> 02:10:18.94 He wasn't even in the same state and
02:10:19.98 --> 02:10:21.98 To an honest life
02:10:21.98 --> 02:10:24.70 I kind of half-assed it and it worked
02:10:27.74 --> 02:10:31.66 I've seen other people go through this to include people my own family and
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:33.66 And
02:10:34.78 --> 02:10:39.02 Everybody's issues could be different my was bad gut for I've seen people have had
02:10:39.66 --> 02:10:42.78 H plyrory which is a parasite which is pretty prominent
02:10:43.90 --> 02:10:45.90 which would
02:10:45.90 --> 02:10:50.30 The symptoms really look like you're having issues with thyroid
02:10:51.90 --> 02:10:53.90 So your initial
02:10:53.90 --> 02:10:59.26 Reaction would be well you're having these issues. I'm gonna take you to end of chronologists and then we're gonna make you take these medications
02:10:59.26 --> 02:11:02.70 So that we fry your thyroid when
02:11:03.26 --> 02:11:07.66 All time it was just a parasite that you could just stop eating sugar and kill it and fix it
02:11:08.70 --> 02:11:10.70 That's what health care should be
02:11:11.10 --> 02:11:13.42 Health care right now is completely reactive
02:11:14.14 --> 02:11:17.82 They don't treat the source of the illness or disease
02:11:18.62 --> 02:11:20.62 They just treat the symptoms
02:11:20.62 --> 02:11:27.10 Uh, what's like 250,000 people die every year because of medical mistake
02:11:28.22 --> 02:11:30.38 And we're listening to these people they almost killed me too
02:11:31.50 --> 02:11:32.70 With a
02:11:32.70 --> 02:11:35.58 potassium. I almost had a heart attack because I had an overdose of potassium
02:11:36.70 --> 02:11:40.22 When another seal who'd been shot in the eye right next door to me was almost overdosed
02:11:41.90 --> 02:11:45.90 Ryan Joe was overdosed when he went in to get surgery just plastic surgery
02:11:45.90 --> 02:11:52.78 And then and then they tried to lie about it. Um, yeah, and those were bad was civilian hospital
02:11:52.78 --> 02:11:56.38 You know what wasn't that wasn't the military. That was civilian hospital
02:11:56.94 --> 02:12:03.34 Medicine's not in his axions everybody's bodies different and that's why it should be evaluated individually because
02:12:04.94 --> 02:12:09.10 I'm pretty narcotic resistant. I wake up in the middle surgeries
02:12:09.10 --> 02:12:13.98 You gotta give me more narcotics to knock me out if you want to do a surgery. I'm gonna wake up and fight
02:12:17.42 --> 02:12:22.46 Good luck in somebody to do surgery after you have to make these statements. I don't like to get hurt anymore. I don't think
02:12:23.42 --> 02:12:25.42 hope
02:12:26.38 --> 02:12:31.98 So you're learning a lot about that. You're also doing all like you said you're doing awesome stuff with with some of the people setting them up
02:12:32.06 --> 02:12:34.06 You know you're doing haunt and trips
02:12:34.78 --> 02:12:36.78 You end up
02:12:36.78 --> 02:12:38.78 Climbing Mount Mount Renewer
02:12:39.02 --> 02:12:46.38 Ryan Joe climbed that blind yeah, you be here before I did yeah, yeah, you say this about that you say our climate been not a Ryan Joe
02:12:46.94 --> 02:12:51.18 Another Navy Sea will been wounded and I racked by a sniper in injury that had left him totally blind
02:12:51.26 --> 02:12:55.02 I had met Ryan once at Mike Monters metal vonna ceremony at the White House
02:12:56.14 --> 02:13:01.90 Which I think we were saying today that was the last time I saw the last time we saw each other before right now. It's good party. Yeah, it was
02:13:01.90 --> 02:13:03.90 um
02:13:04.14 --> 02:13:06.14 Good times
02:13:08.54 --> 02:13:15.10 In 2008 Ryan Joe climbed to the summit of Mount Renewer blind a year later in 2009 he died as a result of
02:13:16.06 --> 02:13:21.98 Hospital error most people know Ryan from the books American sniper and a warrior's faith
02:13:22.78 --> 02:13:27.18 He was the character bigels in the film American sniper on my way down
02:13:27.74 --> 02:13:30.94 I closed my eyes once and gained a new profound
02:13:30.94 --> 02:13:35.34 Respect for Ryan Joe. I couldn't take 10 steps without opening my eyes
02:13:38.78 --> 02:13:40.78 There's some bad parts of that
02:13:41.42 --> 02:13:43.42 You tied to a damn rope to
02:13:43.82 --> 02:13:49.74 I did that when we did that in the seal teams. What's the weather training? Yeah, I actually never did cold weather training
02:13:51.02 --> 02:13:52.06 I hate it
02:13:52.06 --> 02:13:55.82 I mean, I was in some cold spots, but I never you know, I got snowed on plenty
02:13:55.82 --> 02:14:02.78 I froze plenty of times out in the sleet and snow, but I never I never did the cold weather the actual cold weather training
02:14:04.06 --> 02:14:08.70 There's team two guys the old team two guys you still love that stuff. Oh, yeah for sure when I got there
02:14:09.02 --> 02:14:14.14 When I got to team two, you know, I was hoping that I would get to be able to do that, but it was already
02:14:14.70 --> 02:14:19.98 That program was it was no longer like the seal team two was that it's all different. Yeah
02:14:22.06 --> 02:14:24.06 You end up going to
02:14:24.06 --> 02:14:31.10 You end up checking out some kind of I guess was a called alternative medicine treatment alternative options. Oh, yeah
02:14:33.34 --> 02:14:37.42 I went full hippie and I went to a place that was I mean, I like those things
02:14:37.42 --> 02:14:39.58 I like the mindfulness practices
02:14:40.38 --> 02:14:43.34 I should get back to meditating regularly. It does help
02:14:44.46 --> 02:14:48.94 But I was introduced at this place to you know, shooting with a recurve
02:14:48.94 --> 02:14:54.14 You know walk in those paths that made with rocks like that Indians used to do
02:14:55.10 --> 02:14:58.62 So they teach a bunch of mindfulness practices and they were teaching transcendental meditation
02:14:59.50 --> 02:15:01.50 And I think that's the part you're getting to right
02:15:02.30 --> 02:15:06.78 Yeah, it sounds like like I mean the first thing happens you're doing this some acid trip or something
02:15:06.78 --> 02:15:08.86 But yeah, no drugs and ball
02:15:08.86 --> 02:15:16.14 Yeah, you're looking at a chair and all of a sudden the chair turns into human bones and then you guys are going down to do some
02:15:16.14 --> 02:15:18.14 Some some
02:15:18.14 --> 02:15:24.78 Therapy with horses and then then then we were to the book here wall the other participants went to the pen with the instructor
02:15:24.78 --> 02:15:29.02 I stood outside the car out when I turned and looked at an instructor's face
02:15:29.34 --> 02:15:33.90 It was like some type of Hollywood special effects scene. I was staring at him with his damn face
02:15:34.22 --> 02:15:37.02 When his damn face morphed into an evil demon
02:15:37.66 --> 02:15:41.74 I froze terrified and trembling it felt like every cell in my body was vibrating violently
02:15:41.74 --> 02:15:43.98 I just stood there close my eyes and prayed
02:15:43.98 --> 02:15:45.98 God please help me
02:15:47.10 --> 02:15:50.94 I was sure these people were gonna hurt me when I hope my eyes everyone was gone
02:15:50.94 --> 02:15:56.06 I need to get out of there. I saw the group standing in front of the car out and I said as calmly as I could
02:15:56.38 --> 02:16:00.22 Hey guys, thanks for everything. This has been really good, but I need to leave right now
02:16:00.86 --> 02:16:04.62 The instructor's tried to talk me out of leaving saying that it wasn't safe for me to go
02:16:05.50 --> 02:16:09.50 And I stood there thinking well, it's definitely not safe for me to stay here with the demon dude
02:16:09.50 --> 02:16:16.30 I tried to hide it, but I think one of the instructors may have known that I was freaked out one of the female instructors gave me a ride back to my cabin
02:16:16.30 --> 02:16:18.30 I made her use her GPS
02:16:18.30 --> 02:16:22.06 So I knew she was taking me when I arrived back the cabin
02:16:22.06 --> 02:16:26.06 I grabbed my bag chucked into my truck and immediately started driving back to Virginia Beach
02:16:28.22 --> 02:16:30.62 That was as relax was like fully real in your head
02:16:32.22 --> 02:16:37.50 And I didn't want to research after that happened to me. That's when I started I had trouble sleeping after that
02:16:37.50 --> 02:16:42.30 And started doing research and it's an event a quite a few people have
02:16:44.22 --> 02:16:49.42 I thought it was interesting you immediately went and got a drug test a full drug test because you thought maybe you had been drug
02:16:49.42 --> 02:16:51.42 I thought I was drug
02:16:53.66 --> 02:16:55.66 I actually had to stop at a car accident
02:16:56.22 --> 02:17:03.18 On the way out there. Yeah, you stopped at a car accident and so you kind of knew that you could you weren't on drugs because you were doing normal things
02:17:03.18 --> 02:17:05.18 Uh
02:17:06.86 --> 02:17:11.90 Well, I get in what you said you said you knew you weren't insane
02:17:12.38 --> 02:17:15.50 Yeah, because that's why you thought it was drugs. That's what it was because I was
02:17:16.30 --> 02:17:18.30 able to still be objective
02:17:19.50 --> 02:17:21.10 That's when you know you're crazy when you can't keep
02:17:21.66 --> 02:17:22.86 Objective
02:17:22.86 --> 02:17:24.38 You're like am I crazy?
02:17:24.38 --> 02:17:28.70 Like if you're if you're just completely denying the fact that you might be crazy
02:17:28.70 --> 02:17:34.54 Then maybe you are you got back actually investigate it. That's a scary test dude
02:17:35.10 --> 02:17:36.70 I don't know if I passed that old
02:17:37.90 --> 02:17:43.98 But I mean this if you all the research I did on it it happens to a lot of people prominent people educated people
02:17:44.86 --> 02:17:47.50 And I say in the book, you know, I either saw it happen
02:17:48.54 --> 02:17:52.54 Because I have some people that like hey you just have the ability to see evil
02:17:53.26 --> 02:17:57.02 It was a temporary psychotic break which hasn't happened since which I've tried to
02:17:57.02 --> 02:17:59.82 Like man, I don't think that's happened again
02:18:01.10 --> 02:18:04.22 With meditation because I think it was the meditation that did it that
02:18:04.70 --> 02:18:07.42 Popped open different parts of my brain that I never used
02:18:10.46 --> 02:18:14.14 But I cover my ass in there yeah, so people don't think hey, oh my god
02:18:14.14 --> 02:18:17.42 The other thing is lunatic the Kundalini awakening
02:18:17.74 --> 02:18:24.86 Yeah, that's how you had to go check that out. I watched some YouTube videos to figure out what a Kundalini awakening look like and it's like a yoga
02:18:24.86 --> 02:18:29.34 Like you just we it says a weird like spiritual trip I guess
02:18:30.38 --> 02:18:32.38 Yeah, and I would say I'm
02:18:32.38 --> 02:18:37.26 Mike and few people I wear wear this ring, but I would say I'm a recovering Christian don't like religion
02:18:38.06 --> 02:18:43.34 On the spiritual first and I know there's a god. I just he hasn't she hasn't whatever it is hasn't talked to me yet
02:18:43.34 --> 02:18:48.06 So I don't know I don't know who's right. What's really 10 religions on this rock
02:18:48.70 --> 02:18:50.70 There's a more than that
02:18:50.70 --> 02:18:57.82 I guess because that bad trip you decided you were gonna still keep getting after it
02:18:59.42 --> 02:19:02.38 There was a Elliot Miller another awesome seal
02:19:04.38 --> 02:19:07.82 He'd been through some some TBI like treatments
02:19:08.86 --> 02:19:11.58 He was he was wheelchair bound for a long time
02:19:12.38 --> 02:19:14.38 Really overweight
02:19:15.42 --> 02:19:19.74 So he went to that program at Carrack. Yeah, I did the fundraiser for yeah
02:19:19.74 --> 02:19:25.26 Yeah, so you see you do this you end up doing this some you end up trying to figure out how you can raise money
02:19:26.14 --> 02:19:28.70 And and the way you figure out you can raise money is
02:19:30.46 --> 02:19:34.78 Is by doing a triathlon I did a half iron man half iron man
02:19:35.58 --> 02:19:40.46 So I tried to do a full that's that's what I was trading for that that's what everything came down
02:19:41.18 --> 02:19:45.58 So you end up doing the the short one. I'll call it short. I mean it's pretty long
02:19:45.58 --> 02:19:47.58 I guess 13 miles and what is short?
02:19:47.58 --> 02:19:52.62 It's short for triathlon we doing two in a row is exponentially so much harder than that
02:19:53.42 --> 02:19:55.90 I didn't do diabetes because I didn't know enough about nutrition
02:19:57.26 --> 02:20:02.86 Did you do that diabetes before the first one? No while you were training for the second one for the full iron man
02:20:03.18 --> 02:20:05.18 So you do the you do the first one and
02:20:06.38 --> 02:20:09.02 Everyone's all happy you raise $135,000
02:20:10.06 --> 02:20:15.74 Folks at iron man contact you and say hey you're great you gonna subunch of publicity and it's awesome
02:20:15.74 --> 02:20:21.02 Because money Chris Pratt did it with me too. Chris Pratt did it with you. I'm sure they wanted to get some of that. I didn't really was
02:20:23.66 --> 02:20:25.66 Guardians of the galaxy
02:20:25.66 --> 02:20:28.30 Oh that won't stupid movie with a wreck talking wrecking
02:20:28.86 --> 02:20:34.22 Maybe he's not like I'm I'm a fan of Chris now. Yeah, no he seems like a great guy. I'm madam
02:20:34.22 --> 02:20:43.42 Um, but then this happens so they tell you hey you can do another you know we'll sponsor you or whatever you can do it
02:20:44.30 --> 02:20:47.82 And so you start now training for this and here you go
02:20:47.82 --> 02:20:53.58 I was totally exhausted and burned out before the half iron man now was truck training for double the distance
02:20:53.98 --> 02:21:00.30 After the race the first race the words spread about what I was doing and new donors came to my crowd rise page to support me
02:21:00.30 --> 02:21:05.82 Doing the full iron man, but I was at a point where I just could not do my job anymore. I was totally burned out
02:21:06.14 --> 02:21:11.98 And the iron man fund raising and training did nothing but add to my stress everything started to escalate my mind
02:21:11.98 --> 02:21:14.70 I could feel something was on the verge of breaking
02:21:15.50 --> 02:21:21.66 The stress of work training and financial obligations were all becoming too much. I couldn't sleep becoming edgy and difficult to get along with
02:21:21.90 --> 02:21:23.42 On the best of days
02:21:23.42 --> 02:21:29.74 45 days before the corner race. I emailed the iron man folks to thank them for the opportunity and backed out of the race. I
02:21:30.86 --> 02:21:35.18 Contacted every donor and offered them to return all their money. I was a mess at work
02:21:35.18 --> 02:21:42.22 I couldn't I would get urgent calls from shrinks who would say stuff like come get your guys some of my clients would scare the medical
02:21:42.62 --> 02:21:47.82 Staff and the doctors knew if they called the police all held break loose so they called me instead
02:21:47.82 --> 02:21:53.42 I would have to go diffuse the situation these evolutions were exhausting and looking back
02:21:53.42 --> 02:21:57.18 They were all well beyond by area of expertise. I would do the minimum
02:21:57.58 --> 02:22:03.58 Reporting at work then try to sleep or play video games and attempt to distract myself from the constant fear of something bad happening
02:22:03.58 --> 02:22:05.58 I was trapped without an escape route
02:22:06.54 --> 02:22:11.66 Stress accumulates and it was all piling up inside of me. I had no financial help and I'm not one to ask for any
02:22:11.82 --> 02:22:17.26 I was sure there I was going to get fired from my job. This was only the second real job I'd ever had in my life
02:22:17.26 --> 02:22:21.90 Other than being in the Navy. I fell embarrassed and ashamed and amasculated
02:22:21.90 --> 02:22:26.78 I would not leave my home for days on end. I avoided talking to people even turned off my phone
02:22:27.10 --> 02:22:32.78 Brenda was troubled she knows me so well she was gentle at first asked me if I wanted to talk to someone as
02:22:32.78 --> 02:22:36.70 I became more isolated and combat if she reached out to my friends and co-workers
02:22:36.94 --> 02:22:40.54 They joined with her and together they all how did me to get help in
02:22:40.54 --> 02:22:47.10 In a year I'd gone from training to do an iron man triathlon to not being able to get off my couch. I was in a dark
02:22:47.26 --> 02:22:51.50 Dangerous place my life had become unbearable there was guilt
02:22:52.30 --> 02:22:58.86 But I think the real culprit was shame guilt and shame are very different and controlled my thoughts and behaviors and distinct ways
02:22:59.10 --> 02:23:02.38 guilt was about what I had done or in my case what I hadn't done
02:23:02.94 --> 02:23:07.74 Shame was about who I was or at least who at least who I thought I was I felt like a
02:23:07.74 --> 02:23:14.78 A prisoner being brainwashed every day my mind seemed to be stuck on a one track narrative that became darker with each episode
02:23:15.34 --> 02:23:21.10 Every minute of every day there was this weird repeating internal myologue monologue that opened with guilt
02:23:21.26 --> 02:23:28.30 Which created a feeling of shame. I would fixate on things that supported this monologue like bailing out of the iron man
02:23:28.38 --> 02:23:34.22 Which I was which I was sure disappointed the donors the treatment facility my clients and my family
02:23:34.22 --> 02:23:37.58 My anemic efforts at work reinforced my shame
02:23:38.14 --> 02:23:42.14 That's when all the what ifs began chiming in what if I get fired from my job?
02:23:42.14 --> 02:23:44.30 Will we lose the new house and all my money?
02:23:44.30 --> 02:23:49.02 one of the people who donated to my fundraiser think I'm a fraud because I didn't do the full iron man
02:23:49.10 --> 02:23:52.46 These thoughts would lead to embarrassment which deep into my feelings of shame
02:23:52.46 --> 02:23:58.90 I was trapped in this desperate repeating irrational monologue that sounded all rational to me
02:23:58.90 --> 02:24:00.90 I
02:24:02.58 --> 02:24:08.90 Percelling new people like Dan Marcali and Tyler who had far worse injuries than me and far more stressful lives
02:24:09.14 --> 02:24:13.06 And who are all managing themselves well, but for some reason I just couldn't put things in perspective
02:24:13.46 --> 02:24:19.94 I was locked in an irrational disproportionate escalating mental prison. I sat in my truck
02:24:22.74 --> 02:24:27.38 I had researched how to do it exactly where to place the barrel and how to angle the gun
02:24:27.38 --> 02:24:33.78 I had practiced it with a cleared weapon and pulled the trigger. I didn't want to leave a mess for someone else to clean up
02:24:36.18 --> 02:24:40.42 I would not do it in my trucks or someone else could use it the bullet would go through my heart
02:24:40.42 --> 02:24:43.22 There would be an instant of pain and then I would be gone
02:24:45.38 --> 02:24:51.62 I would do to myself with one bullet what four enemy fighters failed to accomplish with 27
02:24:51.62 --> 02:24:57.30 I Stared at the black gun in my hand. I'd use one like this to kill before
02:24:57.70 --> 02:25:01.54 I was numb and sad confused and tired I had cried alone so many times
02:25:01.78 --> 02:25:06.74 My downward spiral had come to its final resting place at the bottom was hopelessness
02:25:08.58 --> 02:25:12.82 The built-up stress the lingering effects of trauma my psychological deficits all
02:25:13.22 --> 02:25:15.62 Caluded to create a condition of hopelessness
02:25:15.62 --> 02:25:22.34 My mind worked trying to come up with an explanation to justify my final act to my two beautiful daughters years ago
02:25:22.34 --> 02:25:26.66 In that room at that compound the thought of not being able to see their faces again terrified me
02:25:28.50 --> 02:25:32.58 Images flashed in my mind holding my daughters little hand in her own as we sat together
02:25:32.90 --> 02:25:38.42 The way the girls would wrap their arms around my neck and hug me their soft little voices called out oh dad
02:25:38.42 --> 02:25:43.62 They're smiling faces repeatedly flashed in my mind
02:25:46.98 --> 02:25:50.90 There was the disproportionate feeling of guilt and shame that relentlessly stalked me
02:25:51.22 --> 02:25:58.26 I felt trapped in a life layered with overwhelming stress andless responsibilities meaningless task and toxic people of
02:25:58.50 --> 02:26:01.22 whom I felt I was the most toxic
02:26:02.98 --> 02:26:04.98 It was all my fault
02:26:04.98 --> 02:26:08.98 I felt I was my own worst enemy this time there was a bullet in the chamber
02:26:09.62 --> 02:26:12.66 I was beyond contemplation my mind was made up
02:26:12.66 --> 02:26:18.26 I mentally paced back and forth working up the courage the same way I had when I hit my father with the bat
02:26:20.26 --> 02:26:24.18 I was getting out of my truck when my phone rang I looked down at the number
02:26:26.10 --> 02:26:28.42 It was Scott Heinz my boss
02:26:29.70 --> 02:26:32.42 I picked up the phone in one hand and held a gun in the other
02:26:32.42 --> 02:26:35.22 I let it ring not wanting to answer
02:26:36.50 --> 02:26:42.42 I couldn't do it with Scott calling so I put down the gun I answered hey Scott what's up?
02:26:45.06 --> 02:26:48.82 It's got says Mike I want you to take the next three months to chill out
02:26:48.82 --> 02:26:52.02 I'm gonna pay you relax take your time and find a new job
02:26:52.02 --> 02:26:56.50 I'll help you out however I can you're beyond burned out you did amazing work
02:26:56.50 --> 02:27:01.46 But there's a time limit for how long you can do this job and you maxed it out my
02:27:03.62 --> 02:27:09.22 Boss and good friend to just give me the hope I needed to climb out of the very deep hole I'd found myself in and that
02:27:09.22 --> 02:27:12.58 Instant I could not have answered my phone for anyone other than Scott
02:27:13.46 --> 02:27:15.46 Scott had seen it all before
02:27:15.46 --> 02:27:19.46 He knew that I was surrounded by wounded sick and injured people all day
02:27:19.78 --> 02:27:25.62 Scott also knew that many of the people who I'd been meeting with every day for years including patients their family members
02:27:25.62 --> 02:27:30.18 Veteran service members and hospital staff were struggling with depression
02:27:30.18 --> 02:27:35.22 It's like an alcohol attending a bar you can only hold out for so long if you're around
02:27:35.86 --> 02:27:40.10 Depressed people all the time you become depressed too
02:27:42.34 --> 02:27:45.86 I suspect that some of you reading this may now think that I'm crazy and write me off
02:27:46.18 --> 02:27:51.22 Thank you for coming this far with me for the rest of you whoever ever been depressed or suicidal
02:27:51.22 --> 02:27:57.86 I can tell you that while I fully believe that the time that I was thinking rationally I know now that I was not
02:27:59.86 --> 02:28:04.74 My irrational thoughts had started repeating themselves the world will be better off without me
02:28:04.74 --> 02:28:10.10 I don't care anymore. I just want out of here. I'm a horrible person my future will just be filled with more of the same stress
02:28:10.42 --> 02:28:14.74 These thoughts seem totally rational and true in my compromise state
02:28:14.74 --> 02:28:19.54 But I had no idea that my thinking was compromised
02:28:21.14 --> 02:28:26.26 What scared me the most about these thoughts and the entire experience is what happened to me just a few months later
02:28:26.58 --> 02:28:34.02 Brenda in her desperation to help convinced me to visit a physician who had a protocol to treat depression and other conditions
02:28:34.02 --> 02:28:43.62 I Resisted at first of course, but finally agreed to work with the guy if only to get Brenda and everyone else off my back
02:28:48.66 --> 02:28:50.66 That's why I did
02:28:54.26 --> 02:28:56.26 Man
02:28:56.26 --> 02:29:03.62 You get it's interesting, you know, you talk about the um
02:29:05.06 --> 02:29:11.86 Like now you can look back and see that you want rational. Oh, yeah, but at the time there's just you know
02:29:12.18 --> 02:29:14.18 It's a chemical about I mean
02:29:16.10 --> 02:29:21.14 It's be more people are coming aware of it now that the gut brain access
02:29:21.14 --> 02:29:24.74 I mean
02:29:26.74 --> 02:29:31.06 The gut is probably a smarter brain than the one in our skull
02:29:33.14 --> 02:29:37.78 It can't operate properly unless unless you put proper nutrients and
02:29:40.34 --> 02:29:44.02 And vitamins and this doctor is also really big into the EMF
02:29:44.74 --> 02:29:49.14 electromagnetic fields, you know, you know how we're affected. I mean we had
02:29:49.14 --> 02:29:56.34 Radio antennas over in Iraq and Afghanistan, you could put popcorn kernels in it. Pop popcorn. What do you think that does to your
02:29:57.70 --> 02:30:01.46 Do you think that does to your skull and your organs and your cells?
02:30:02.66 --> 02:30:04.66 We already
02:30:04.66 --> 02:30:07.62 Residents as a weapon you can use microwaves to make people sick
02:30:08.98 --> 02:30:10.98 Where yeah, I was a radio man unfortunately
02:30:11.94 --> 02:30:16.02 Love the job, but I mean sat all all those antennas man. I was
02:30:16.02 --> 02:30:22.34 Possibly here's a young guy getting we took the what was that thing called the bat one?
02:30:23.14 --> 02:30:25.14 Yeah, the vehicle antenna for the satellite
02:30:25.70 --> 02:30:30.42 We figured it well one of our new guys put it on on the radio with a switch
02:30:30.98 --> 02:30:32.50 So this
02:30:32.50 --> 02:30:35.62 My sees running right and look like Inspector Gadget, you know with helicopter
02:30:36.50 --> 02:30:38.74 And you had that bat wing hanging out over top of his head
02:30:38.74 --> 02:30:42.82 I don't I don't think sat transmissions are very healthy but
02:30:46.34 --> 02:30:51.06 Frequencies you know residents we can use his weapon it could be used for the heal
02:30:55.70 --> 02:30:59.38 Microwaves they've been used a lot to make people sick
02:31:00.58 --> 02:31:06.10 So so you go through all that you kind of get this doctor doctor back so to put you on
02:31:06.10 --> 02:31:11.78 A path like a new mission of you're gonna clean up your diet. You're gonna stay away from these
02:31:13.38 --> 02:31:21.06 situations the Bluetooth limit your limit your exposure to your eye fine all this stuff which is hard. Oh, yeah for sure the you methods hard
02:31:21.70 --> 02:31:23.70 so
02:31:24.26 --> 02:31:26.26 Pretty much blew that off
02:31:27.14 --> 02:31:32.34 So what did you mostly what did you mostly fix your diet mostly it was diet got my gut
02:31:32.34 --> 02:31:34.98 Back right so that it
02:31:35.78 --> 02:31:39.38 Because the way that works you're got prepares the food for the intestines for the intestines
02:31:39.38 --> 02:31:43.06 What they do and the stomach doesn't work then that just it's gonna pass through
02:31:43.70 --> 02:31:47.14 The intestines are not gonna be able to pull the nutrients and vitamins and I
02:31:48.02 --> 02:31:51.78 Don't think any medication now I I am taking Mitch's
02:31:53.38 --> 02:31:55.38 Smash ingredients
02:31:55.38 --> 02:32:00.28 I started off with this doctor put me on a stuff called green juice from organic
02:32:00.28 --> 02:32:02.28 Fine
02:32:02.28 --> 02:32:05.80 So it's it's got all the you can have in one shake all the nutrients
02:32:06.60 --> 02:32:11.08 You know one scoop of protein and one scoop of greens that's all you need
02:32:12.60 --> 02:32:14.44 Pretty I mean we could live on algae and
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.000 You'll go to these cool lunches that these kids were getting not now because of COVID, but
02:32:20.04 --> 02:32:21.64 I mean they would feed them crap
02:32:21.88 --> 02:32:27.16 They're actually making them sick. They're not helping them. Yeah, I mean like tomatoes with like
02:32:27.16 --> 02:32:30.68 Crapy hamburger meat on it. Yeah, if it's even hamburger meat
02:32:31.80 --> 02:32:33.80 If it's hamburger meat, it's not great
02:32:35.32 --> 02:32:40.44 So so you get done you go on this protocol and you say this it took about two months and even then I
02:32:41.16 --> 02:32:42.36 I
02:32:42.36 --> 02:32:46.84 Would shop for all the foods meticulously prepare the meat measure all the meals
02:32:47.80 --> 02:32:53.88 Keep the detailed food log. I'm sure the process was gradual one day woke up and felt like the black cloud that I had been
02:32:53.88 --> 02:32:58.24 That had been hovering over me with for years was gone. I was able to function to move and
02:32:58.24 --> 02:33:03.96 Feed quickly. Thankfully the fog had lifted and the constant negative internal monologue inside my head stopped
02:33:03.96 --> 02:33:09.000 I felt strong clear and confident enough to get up and start moving forward
02:33:11.24 --> 02:33:17.32 Grab my phone opened up my contact list and started sending text text messages and making calls
02:33:17.72 --> 02:33:19.72 I needed a new job
02:33:19.72 --> 02:33:22.20 And that's when you ended up going to trade it
02:33:22.20 --> 02:33:28.12 Back to trade it as a contractor. I went back to teaching military freefall where prior injury
02:33:29.48 --> 02:33:36.20 I had three events where I couldn't open my main parachute because my right scapula would seize up my whole back in my hand
02:33:36.20 --> 02:33:39.40 Went and works. I had three high-fet high-speed melt functions
02:33:39.96 --> 02:33:43.40 Went to reserve in the last one rip my pack off my
02:33:44.20 --> 02:33:47.96 Connects between your arm. Did you get surgery? Yeah, they reconnected it
02:33:47.96 --> 02:33:52.52 But it was a slot there the whole pack came out of right here
02:33:53.80 --> 02:33:58.36 Dang so then I went to CQC and so yeah, which is which was awesome
02:33:59.40 --> 02:34:04.44 Because the TTPs changed because of me. Yeah, that's that's
02:34:05.80 --> 02:34:12.20 Perfect place for you to go and teach me what better person be teaching about out-of-hand little close-quarters combat that someone and don't do it
02:34:12.20 --> 02:34:18.04 I mean, we still teach that but there's there's better ways to do things some
02:34:19.72 --> 02:34:23.40 Different tactics you can use in different situations you can't just do the same thing every time
02:34:24.84 --> 02:34:26.84 And then how long did you stay there for?
02:34:27.80 --> 02:34:29.80 Uh
02:34:30.36 --> 02:34:35.72 Because you're you're you're retired now from that job as well, right? So what is it 2020 quick
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000 18
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.24 I was I was probably at trade-up between those two jobs for about three years. Okay
02:34:44.12 --> 02:34:50.04 Awesome. Yeah, that's just let that like last October. I think that's it. It's a cool thing that the teams do bring in
02:34:50.28 --> 02:34:54.92 Older guys back that have experience at some of the younger guys might not have especially someone with experience like you and
02:34:55.16 --> 02:34:59.80 Bring them in there to teach and pass on those words man. That's freaking awesome that that we do that in the teams
02:34:59.80 --> 02:35:03.96 I learned a lot there being an instructor and like you were talking about earlier, you know watching
02:35:03.96 --> 02:35:10.76 Um 20 different groups come through people do different things in different ways and like man that was really stupid or man
02:35:11.48 --> 02:35:13.48 I wish I would have thought of that
02:35:14.84 --> 02:35:19.40 You ended up getting some tattoos and this was cool. You know Mike Martin
02:35:20.44 --> 02:35:26.60 Who's a master chief team guy that was in Vietnam who had gotten out of the god now for like a long time
02:35:26.84 --> 02:35:31.64 Well, he was at training cell at team three when I got there. Yeah, he had gotten out for a long time then he gone
02:35:31.64 --> 02:35:36.52 But join the region of the Navy and back to Buds. I don't think they made him do
02:35:38.12 --> 02:35:44.60 Real buds. Yeah, they he's like one of a few people that went through like a gentleman's course of buds. You know
02:35:44.76 --> 02:35:49.24 Well, then we had to retread my class. I didn't make it was he a reach-ed Vietnam vet
02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.72 I believe so really he was terrible. Dang that's kind of like Martin's
02:35:55.72 --> 02:36:01.08 Well, he passed away last year on the other side and I'll tell you what he was only 62
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:08.68 Bro we were I was we use call he was gonna come on the podcast and and and like I was lined it up with you know
02:36:08.68 --> 02:36:13.32 one of our mutual friends and and we're just you know just trying to find the date and boom
02:36:13.88 --> 02:36:18.60 Yeah, I was freaking so bummed out that was the first Navy seal book. I haven't read many but
02:36:19.32 --> 02:36:20.68 Navy seals don't ring Navy seal
02:36:20.68 --> 02:36:22.68 Fuck
02:36:23.24 --> 02:36:25.24 You know there's so many of them too so many jokes
02:36:25.72 --> 02:36:28.92 I was just hanging out with black rifle and I was like, yeah, you guys want to sell books in here
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:31.64 You know the military books. I was like yeah, it's a good idea
02:36:31.64 --> 02:36:35.16 But we'll have to reinforce the shelf for all the Navy seal books like your asshole
02:36:35.56 --> 02:36:41.32 Well, I was sitting down with the black rifle guys up in Montana and it was me and
02:36:42.68 --> 02:36:47.40 Dudley the Dartsury guy and and then and then and then Jack Carr was
02:36:47.40 --> 02:36:53.32 What's his name the other owner small or it was Evan it was Evan that was who was there
02:36:53.32 --> 02:36:56.12 It was just so I think it was because the other guy I got hurt. I thought he got hurt
02:36:56.12 --> 02:37:03.96 Yeah, not got hurt. Yeah, so he couldn't come but anyways, we sit down and and you know Evan makes a joke about seals writing books
02:37:04.76 --> 02:37:11.96 And did it to me too and then of course I looked at him and I was like because I mean it's a funny joke. Yes, but then we were actually sit with two
02:37:11.96 --> 02:37:18.52 Seals that have written books. I was like, oh, this is really embarrassing. I go real funny Evan
02:37:20.12 --> 02:37:24.12 They're a great group of guys. They're definitely doing their job paying it forward first year, man
02:37:24.36 --> 02:37:29.08 For sure. I mean, I was really bummed out when I saw well first of all when I found up at you into the Toulower tree
02:37:29.08 --> 02:37:32.68 Challenge there and I just did I don't know why didn't put two and two together
02:37:33.24 --> 02:37:36.68 Well, I didn't find out until after you left Montana. Yeah, so I was like
02:37:36.68 --> 02:37:43.08 But then the other thing I didn't know is I knew I knew that they were doing something with with wounded warriors
02:37:44.28 --> 02:37:48.04 I I know what they were doing. I didn't really grasp it again. I just didn't pay enough attention
02:37:48.04 --> 02:37:52.28 But I could I should have gone down there for that look for you know awesome what they rolled into a
02:37:52.84 --> 02:37:58.76 huge archery event afterwards. So we there was 25 of us. I was one of two guys. It wasn't an MPT
02:37:59.32 --> 02:38:01.32 There was a dude there that didn't have a right arm
02:38:02.04 --> 02:38:04.28 I saw videos of him you fight that thing
02:38:04.28 --> 02:38:06.28 Yep
02:38:06.28 --> 02:38:11.24 And awesome too. Yeah, I didn't shit that like a hundred and eight yards. Yeah, there's something real cool about archery that
02:38:12.28 --> 02:38:17.40 That it has a lot of similarities, you know to the old job, you know, I like shooting a bow better
02:38:17.80 --> 02:38:22.28 Yeah, I do too. I like shooting a bow better the main reason is because it's quiet
02:38:22.28 --> 02:38:24.12 It's like there's no like little shock
02:38:24.36 --> 02:38:27.24 It's just nice and quiet. You can do it in your yard and it's harder
02:38:27.72 --> 02:38:33.40 Actually, yeah, it is harder well to definitely harder at range and then you pick up a recurve
02:38:33.40 --> 02:38:35.80 I haven't done the recurve thing. Yeah, that's cool
02:38:36.28 --> 02:38:41.16 Is that what you're like primarily shooting is a recurve? These were compounds, but I've got a couple of recurves
02:38:41.16 --> 02:38:46.20 And it's all instinctive. Yeah, yeah, you just ain't even well you can't it? There's no sights
02:38:46.52 --> 02:38:49.56 There's no refrains that you can tell if you went dead and go it is totally
02:38:50.60 --> 02:38:54.76 Yeah, there's a couple of guys that were trying to do some long shots up in Montana with the recurres man
02:38:55.24 --> 02:39:02.60 Yeah, looks fun. Looks fun. I don't know if I got a lot of work to do on the compound before I decided I'm gonna make it even harder
02:39:02.60 --> 02:39:05.40 Yeah, you just turned up the juice on that right
02:39:06.60 --> 02:39:08.60 Man
02:39:08.60 --> 02:39:13.16 Yeah, so what are I'm guys hitting stuff at 108 yards? How hard can it be? That's freaking awesome. Only got one arm
02:39:13.96 --> 02:39:17.24 I'm gonna awesome and just freaking out low-paz
02:39:21.80 --> 02:39:23.80 Get close here, but you know you say this
02:39:24.68 --> 02:39:29.64 In macing strange, but being shot 27 times then having a hang grenade flow up next to me
02:39:29.64 --> 02:39:34.52 Was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It was the start of a personal revolution that continues today
02:39:34.52 --> 02:39:41.08 And hopefully we'll go on until I take my last breath. I say revolution rather than evolution as a result of my experience
02:39:41.08 --> 02:39:48.20 I have tossed out and or abandoned in every bias relationship belief and dogma that has blocked myself awareness and
02:39:48.92 --> 02:39:50.92 joy
02:39:52.92 --> 02:39:56.28 You said and again, I'm reading this stuff because I know that there's
02:39:56.28 --> 02:40:00.28 People and people talk to me all the time about what they're going through and
02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.40 You know what you say here. I think is really important
02:40:04.52 --> 02:40:06.52 I burn through a number of therapists
02:40:06.92 --> 02:40:13.88 Some were good most didn't have what I needed to help me understand how the traumas of my childhood shaped me as a person and how those same traumas
02:40:14.20 --> 02:40:15.72 Make some of my behaviors
02:40:15.96 --> 02:40:17.48 predictable at times
02:40:17.48 --> 02:40:21.56 I had to be pushed into seeing therapists and doctors by people who loved and cared about me
02:40:21.56 --> 02:40:27.32 I don't know if I can ever think these people enough for not giving up on me when I was so rude and resistant toward them
02:40:28.20 --> 02:40:31.40 I say all of this so you know that at least for me
02:40:31.56 --> 02:40:38.68 There has been no magic pill quick fix or one size fits all solution to finding peace and joy in my life
02:40:39.08 --> 02:40:44.92 These things have come to me slowly over the past decade as I grew in self-awareness and courage
02:40:44.92 --> 02:40:52.28 I suspect your personal peace if that's what you're searching for maybe gained much the same way
02:40:55.40 --> 02:40:57.40 Yeah, you know, I think that
02:40:58.28 --> 02:40:59.96 That uh
02:40:59.96 --> 02:41:05.08 Just letting people know like somebody thinks oh, I'm gonna go see a therapist and it doesn't work out because that therapist doesn't have with that
02:41:05.08 --> 02:41:10.52 Perpetent particular person needs and then they go I'll see I can't be helped instead of saying oh, you know what?
02:41:10.52 --> 02:41:13.80 I gotta try some different people. What's a sidedle to um
02:41:16.52 --> 02:41:18.28 People think that they you know
02:41:19.56 --> 02:41:22.76 Could take you years to get into a terrible mindset
02:41:23.56 --> 02:41:28.92 Betches training telling yourself doing all the things that make you believe the things that that you're telling yourself
02:41:29.72 --> 02:41:33.56 And then you hit rock bottom or what you think rock bottom and you're like I really get this fix
02:41:33.56 --> 02:41:35.16 I'm gonna go to this one week program
02:41:35.56 --> 02:41:37.80 You know it took me two years to turn into this
02:41:37.80 --> 02:41:42.92 Disaster area and I'm I think I'm gonna go to a one week program. I'm gonna fix it
02:41:43.48 --> 02:41:47.88 And a lot of these programs that I watch when I was at the care coalition it does help, but there's no follow-up
02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.16 So there's an improvement while they're there because everybody's you know feed them good food
02:41:54.44 --> 02:41:56.44 teaching them the things that
02:41:56.44 --> 02:42:01.32 They can use to you know relieve stress and they do that while they're there
02:42:02.52 --> 02:42:05.000 And then they go home and then they just fall back into the same routine
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.72 Training themselves to get further into that hole
02:42:08.36 --> 02:42:09.72 I mean
02:42:09.72 --> 02:42:11.72 That's what medicine is right now
02:42:11.72 --> 02:42:15.72 Yeah, people get sick. They think that they can take a a medication. It's gonna make
02:42:16.28 --> 02:42:20.04 Make the sickness go away. You're not even addressing wires sick. You're just
02:42:22.44 --> 02:42:24.44 Hiding the symptoms
02:42:26.44 --> 02:42:31.24 I mean like I earlier I said I actually didn't do diabetes and it was because I didn't know enough
02:42:31.24 --> 02:42:35.08 Batin iteration and the only thing I knew about nutrition is if I was hungry or not and
02:42:36.12 --> 02:42:40.36 My favorite restaurants were the ones that gave me the most food. I think care what it was
02:42:42.76 --> 02:42:46.92 You know extra large peaches of myself galinized cream and a total pack of beer. You know, that's
02:42:48.04 --> 02:42:51.40 That's the winning path but it'd be not definitely not
02:42:54.52 --> 02:42:56.52 It's funny too because we all know
02:42:56.52 --> 02:42:58.52 Uh
02:42:59.08 --> 02:43:00.84 Even since we were a little kid you are what you eat
02:43:01.80 --> 02:43:06.84 But we know it but we don't practice it and then you got the FDA with it stupid food pyramid
02:43:07.88 --> 02:43:11.88 You know, you've got people now. Oh my stuff's at the a-proof. I'm like so what
02:43:13.08 --> 02:43:14.76 Corrupt organization
02:43:14.76 --> 02:43:18.68 Go eat five loaves of bread like they told you to no wonder everybody's fat. Yeah
02:43:19.40 --> 02:43:22.04 Can you say pre-diabetic oh and then they take
02:43:22.04 --> 02:43:28.76 Medication I mean type two diabetes. Oh, you gotta do change your diet goes away. I did it
02:43:29.88 --> 02:43:31.88 I induced it with cliff bars
02:43:32.92 --> 02:43:37.96 Gatorade I was needing twinkies. Yeah, I was just you're thinking what seemed like it's cool
02:43:38.36 --> 02:43:41.000 Yeah, well, and I was also being trained by an ultra-thinner
02:43:42.68 --> 02:43:43.96 And
02:43:43.96 --> 02:43:45.96 Third-dummer than we are
02:43:45.96 --> 02:43:47.96 Who goes and runs out of my
02:43:47.96 --> 02:43:49.96 Ha
02:43:50.20 --> 02:43:57.24 She take my ass man and I just didn't know enough about an interest and and I was just dumping carbs and sugars in the man
02:43:58.68 --> 02:44:02.04 Every time I stood up I was almost passing out. Let's die be these
02:44:03.64 --> 02:44:06.12 Crazy, see as I fixed it and went away
02:44:09.08 --> 02:44:15.48 Here's another little section that I think people should hear. I have a way I have way more stress and uncertainty in my life today
02:44:15.48 --> 02:44:22.44 than I ever did in the seal teams or when I was suicidal the differences that I now have a new resiliency portfolio of people
02:44:22.60 --> 02:44:27.32 Tools and skills that allows me to effectively manage stress almost effortlessly
02:44:27.80 --> 02:44:30.20 While I do have bad days and very bad days
02:44:30.60 --> 02:44:34.20 They don't control me or impact my outlook on life
02:44:35.32 --> 02:44:40.68 I'm also keenly aware that most of my troubles are self-inflicted
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:45.32 If you're honest with yourself you may find the same is true in your own life
02:44:45.72 --> 02:44:51.000 Diversity is either a privilege or a tragedy depending on how you respond to it
02:44:51.80 --> 02:44:57.000 Choosing to be a victim of the events and circumstances in my life would have been the real tragedy
02:44:58.04 --> 02:45:06.12 What if we all view diverse adversity as an opportunity for personal growth to define our life's purpose and to help others?
02:45:06.36 --> 02:45:08.36 The reality is that we can
02:45:08.36 --> 02:45:15.80 But we can't do any of these things as victims. If I am to evolve which is my life's mission I can't be a victim
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:20.12 Even if my problems are the result of someone else's actions
02:45:20.12 --> 02:45:25.80 I've found it easier to find myself than to rely on the perpetrator to repair the damage
02:45:27.16 --> 02:45:28.52 Well, that's what a lot of victims do
02:45:29.64 --> 02:45:35.64 You're a victim because you're blaming somebody else and you're expecting them to fix it and there's just nobody's coming
02:45:35.64 --> 02:45:41.56 You know, they're not going to fix it. Yeah, see what it's about just take the blame take take the ownership and solve the problem
02:45:45.32 --> 02:45:52.20 After everything that I've come through I'm grateful. I think that the gratitude and service are I think that gratitude and service are unspeparable
02:45:53.16 --> 02:46:00.04 The more I serve the more grateful I feel that I can still serve and care for my family my warrior brothers and sisters and continue to be
02:46:00.04 --> 02:46:06.36 have serviced to all of you these days. I spend my free time hunting for perfect surf and spending time with great friends
02:46:06.76 --> 02:46:11.24 I set up a non-profit to help shorten the distance to recovery from trauma and depression
02:46:12.52 --> 02:46:15.88 We join with people who truly want to help themselves
02:46:16.84 --> 02:46:22.04 We offer these adventurous souls a community of the right relationships and a portfolio of
02:46:22.04 --> 02:46:24.52 Resiliency skills and tools
02:46:24.52 --> 02:46:31.08 And what's the name of that? It's a little bit of forward thinking I'm just on the overall right now
02:46:31.08 --> 02:46:34.36 I was putting in the paperwork. It's called warrior tribe and
02:46:35.56 --> 02:46:40.76 The focus is going to be full trauma metal on this and I want to get into
02:46:42.60 --> 02:46:44.60 Atrescuth
02:46:45.64 --> 02:46:49.08 For you can awesome man the kids that were like me that are one decision away from
02:46:49.08 --> 02:46:58.28 Winding up in the federal prison system. Yeah, or winding up on a great career in the military or some other path
02:46:58.28 --> 02:47:00.28 You know takes one decision
02:47:01.48 --> 02:47:03.48 I got lucky, you know
02:47:05.08 --> 02:47:07.08 You know what
02:47:07.72 --> 02:47:10.92 I just want to close it out with what you close this book out with
02:47:12.76 --> 02:47:14.76 Joseph Clark Schwedler
02:47:16.12 --> 02:47:18.12 It comes in waves now and again
02:47:18.12 --> 02:47:22.68 There's an overwhelming feeling of disbelief that gives away to frustration
02:47:23.72 --> 02:47:25.72 Then my eyes usually well up
02:47:26.92 --> 02:47:31.000 It's been going on for years now. I've lost so many people it takes a toll
02:47:33.64 --> 02:47:36.68 Clark was the kind of man you want your son to grow up to be
02:47:38.76 --> 02:47:44.28 He was smart driven had a great sense of humor was tough but thoughtful and responsible
02:47:44.28 --> 02:47:51.24 He was a born leader and he made us all better people after missions we'd be tired
02:47:51.24 --> 02:47:54.04 But Clark he would be working out so we'd work out too
02:47:55.64 --> 02:48:02.04 He was like a Swiss army knife. He was our navigator our intel collections guy a team leader sensitive
02:48:02.04 --> 02:48:07.000 Sight exploitation officer and one of our Iraqi army combat advisors
02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:10.44 He picked up everything fast and became great at whatever he did
02:48:10.44 --> 02:48:15.32 Clark's dream was to be an AV seal
02:48:16.52 --> 02:48:21.48 He was a Midwestern kid from crystal falls on northern Michigan town of
02:48:22.20 --> 02:48:24.20 1,469 people
02:48:25.96 --> 02:48:30.44 He was a senior class president played high school football and basketball and ran track
02:48:34.28 --> 02:48:38.44 He did two years at Michigan state and joined the rowing team knowing Clarky
02:48:38.44 --> 02:48:42.44 He did it because the workouts were grueling and he wanted to stay in shape
02:48:44.84 --> 02:48:47.08 He followed his heart abandoned college
02:48:49.64 --> 02:48:53.16 And enlisted in the Navy to fulfill his dream of becoming a seal
02:48:58.60 --> 02:49:02.20 Clarky got to live his dream and did what he loved to do
02:49:02.20 --> 02:49:05.96 Every time I saw him he had a smile on his face
02:49:10.44 --> 02:49:15.32 What gives me peace is knowing that if I died doing my job as a seal I would have no regrets
02:49:16.68 --> 02:49:18.68 And I know Clarky felt the same way
02:49:23.56 --> 02:49:28.52 For those of us who have lost friends and family members in this war the losses connect us
02:49:28.52 --> 02:49:33.88 While we may be strangers we know each other well
02:49:36.60 --> 02:49:40.04 There is a surprising comfort in being together in this painful club
02:49:40.44 --> 02:49:44.68 We don't have words to describe the depth of our grief, but we don't need them
02:49:46.36 --> 02:49:48.36 Because we can feel each other sorrow
02:49:48.36 --> 02:49:55.56 There's a saying time heals all wounds
02:49:59.08 --> 02:49:59.72 It doesn't
02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.32 It only makes them slightly less painful
02:50:10.12 --> 02:50:13.000 I may again meet up with Clarky on the other side of this life
02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.72 I'm looking forward to it
02:50:28.20 --> 02:50:30.20 You know a lot knowing
02:50:34.92 --> 02:50:37.72 They just put some new stars and paws on the
02:50:37.72 --> 02:50:43.48 They could worry and virgin in each I didn't even know about the dogs at past
02:50:49.16 --> 02:50:51.16 I think one of them was a suicide
02:50:52.52 --> 02:50:54.52 died by suicide
02:50:59.88 --> 02:51:03.08 Terrible place to be but since I've been there I know I can't get there again
02:51:03.08 --> 02:51:09.64 And that was one phone call from one person that stopped me so
02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000 Almost didn't answer that phone
02:51:15.88 --> 02:51:18.36 Yeah, and I think homobviously the less in there is
02:51:19.88 --> 02:51:24.04 Well, it messes a lot of people up the secondary tertiary effects
02:51:24.04 --> 02:51:32.68 I told our nutritionists about it. You helped me out with the guys that I was assigned to
02:51:34.44 --> 02:51:38.36 Told her what I'd almost done and she was like do you know how many people that would hurt?
02:51:39.32 --> 02:51:40.52 I never considered that
02:51:41.80 --> 02:51:44.68 I thought I was doing people a favor. That's how rational I was
02:51:47.56 --> 02:51:51.56 But I've been around families where there's been a death by suicide and it
02:51:51.56 --> 02:51:55.000 It's terrible what it does to the people that are left behind
02:51:57.32 --> 02:51:59.32 It's
02:52:02.04 --> 02:52:04.04 They don't recover from it
02:52:06.68 --> 02:52:12.60 Well, you know, this this kind of tribute that you wrote there in the end to Clark
02:52:14.12 --> 02:52:20.44 It's awesome, but you know from my perspective there's there's no more powerful tribute than you can make then
02:52:20.44 --> 02:52:23.96 Then doing what you're doing right now, you know trying to help other people out
02:52:25.96 --> 02:52:30.52 Trying to live a good life take carry family and and really
02:52:32.68 --> 02:52:37.96 Sharing all the things that you've been through and how you made it through them
02:52:38.92 --> 02:52:44.68 with other people and I think there's nothing better that you could do to truly on reclarks
02:52:44.68 --> 02:52:54.12 His sacrifice and I do want to make it clear to it. I am still seeking a continuum of care
02:52:56.12 --> 02:53:02.52 I'm recently looking at a program called Sabah warrior which hand-fold guys have gone to
02:53:05.08 --> 02:53:07.80 The last three years of my life probably be a lot better book
02:53:08.76 --> 02:53:12.84 This stuff that I've been dealing with is last three years and the fact that I'm able to manage it
02:53:12.84 --> 02:53:16.12 is is pretty incredible to me, but
02:53:18.68 --> 02:53:23.24 I don't know I think some people think oh I've had my eyes handed me up into this point nothing else is going to happen
02:53:23.80 --> 02:53:30.92 I mean shit still going to happen and I've just been able to get to the point where
02:53:32.36 --> 02:53:36.68 No matter how bad I got my eyes handed to me I somehow fixed it or somebody helped me fixed it and
02:53:36.68 --> 02:53:42.28 I just had that mindset now. I don't care if the rest of you turn into zombies. I'll figure it out what it happens
02:53:43.48 --> 02:53:48.52 But your point you're pointing saying that you're still you still are on the path of
02:53:49.08 --> 02:53:52.60 You still know you need help now. Yeah, I think everybody does
02:53:54.52 --> 02:53:59.000 There was a point in my life when I would have said now I'm fine, but there's always room for improvement
02:54:00.76 --> 02:54:02.76 That's an easy way for someone
02:54:02.76 --> 02:54:09.48 You say you don't have to say you need help, right? It's room for improvement. Yeah, that's a that's a better of team guy way of saying it
02:54:09.72 --> 02:54:14.84 Because a team guy never wants to say I need some help, but if you say to a team guy don't you want to get don't you want to improve?
02:54:16.04 --> 02:54:21.72 99% of team guys say hell yeah, I want to improve and another thing with that to it takes you while to get to a bad state
02:54:22.28 --> 02:54:28.12 You know that one week program's not going to do it a continuum of care and that's working out good diet
02:54:28.12 --> 02:54:32.76 You know taking care of the things that that lower the stress hormones
02:54:33.96 --> 02:54:37.08 It's it's not just one thing. It's it's a lifestyle change
02:54:37.96 --> 02:54:41.24 You can't expect to be well if you're taking down a fifth every day
02:54:42.20 --> 02:54:44.60 And I'm not going to be a hit for create. I probably drink too much beer
02:54:45.56 --> 02:54:47.08 But
02:54:47.32 --> 02:54:51.16 But I also take in all the nutrients and vitamins and I need to be for a drink too much beer
02:54:51.16 --> 02:54:53.16 Oh
02:54:56.36 --> 02:54:59.40 Well, hey man look we've been going at it over three hours right now
02:55:01.40 --> 02:55:09.000 Where can people people can find you Instagram? Yeah, my Instagram handle is Mike day 53 26
02:55:10.20 --> 02:55:15.64 My social media is a train wreck until I hire somebody. I don't know what I'm doing and my website
02:55:15.64 --> 02:55:18.76 I have a website my daughter who's my GI bill to get a
02:55:18.76 --> 02:55:25.32 Graphic design degree did my website is perfectly wounded.com. Okay, so that's where people can find you
02:55:28.04 --> 02:55:30.04 Any other any other closing thoughts
02:55:31.32 --> 02:55:33.32 No, I just
02:55:33.32 --> 02:55:35.32 There is no easy button nobody's coming
02:55:36.52 --> 02:55:39.48 Nobody's gonna take care of you better than you can take care of yourself
02:55:39.48 --> 02:55:48.84 It's they're I can't say enough. There's not an easy button you train yourself to get yourself to a certain point
02:55:48.84 --> 02:55:54.92 That's your mindset that's training and you just look at it like that if you can train into a bad mindset you can train out
02:55:56.28 --> 02:55:57.88 And
02:55:57.88 --> 02:56:00.52 And if you are hanging out with a bunch of depressed people or people
02:56:01.16 --> 02:56:04.52 That are like minded that that are negative you're gonna catch it
02:56:04.52 --> 02:56:11.000 I mean we used to kill that stuff in the sealed teams there's always want that one guy that bitch didn't complain about everything
02:56:11.24 --> 02:56:16.68 And if you didn't stop it then his buddy started bitchening complain and then it was like a damn disease
02:56:19.88 --> 02:56:24.04 The negative thoughts and negative actions are not gonna fix and
02:56:26.20 --> 02:56:28.84 I'll fit the jackdainals everyday doesn't fix it
02:56:30.28 --> 02:56:32.28 You eventually you're not to still deal with it
02:56:32.28 --> 02:56:34.28 fff
02:56:34.28 --> 02:56:38.28 Right all man those are little freaking good good guidance right there and
02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.000 Man thanks for sitting down here. Thanks for talking with a thanks for coming all the way out here
02:56:44.36 --> 02:56:48.36 Thanks for thanks for everything you did for the teams and for the navy and for America and
02:56:49.16 --> 02:56:51.16 Man the example you set for
02:56:52.12 --> 02:56:53.40 You know
02:56:53.40 --> 02:56:58.76 For people not not just for what you did in the teams but like the example you're setting right now being
02:56:58.76 --> 02:57:01.96 Put yourself out there explaining how to overcome things
02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.72 It's freaking awesome man. I appreciate it. I don't like giving advice. I'll try to live by example
02:57:07.72 --> 02:57:11.24 You know, it was came back from black rifle those those people
02:57:12.68 --> 02:57:13.72 Yep
02:57:13.72 --> 02:57:16.20 MPTs still going through surgeries and
02:57:16.92 --> 02:57:22.36 Their lives are so much harder just to get up at a bed, you know a paraplegic and what a pain of the butt that is but they
02:57:22.92 --> 02:57:26.20 They still fight through it and they were living by example
02:57:26.20 --> 02:57:31.08 And when I was at the care collection it did kind of help me for a long time
02:57:31.08 --> 02:57:35.96 I could I complain when you know Dan can ask and say the bulk double above the NPD
02:57:36.60 --> 02:57:40.04 Taylor morse is a quad a help and I'm never seen the guy be upset
02:57:43.40 --> 02:57:48.44 So it is it is inspiring to see people that we assume have a worse deal
02:57:48.44 --> 02:57:55.80 Which is a hard thing for people to get across to like I don't have the right to feel this way because that guys worse for that girls worse
02:57:56.36 --> 02:57:59.56 Which is not true. You know everybody's issues are there issues and
02:58:00.68 --> 02:58:03.08 They have to be addressed even though you don't have
02:58:03.72 --> 02:58:05.08 The worst deal
02:58:05.08 --> 02:58:08.28 You know be happy you don't have the worst deal. You don't have to fix that one
02:58:08.60 --> 02:58:11.56 Yeah, you might not have the worst deal, but it's your deal and you got to deal with it
02:58:13.24 --> 02:58:14.28 Awesome man
02:58:14.28 --> 02:58:15.64 Appreciate it brother. Thanks guys
02:58:15.64 --> 02:58:18.92 And with that
02:58:20.20 --> 02:58:22.60 Mike Day has left the building
02:58:24.28 --> 02:58:31.08 Awesome to see him and that ends up being yet another excuse removal podcast
02:58:32.44 --> 02:58:34.44 What does that mean meaning
02:58:35.80 --> 02:58:42.28 It's kind of hard to make excuses when you're get done talking about like that. Who's been through a lot
02:58:42.28 --> 02:58:45.08 And he's not making excuses so
02:58:46.52 --> 02:58:49.48 Well echo Charles yeah, yeah, that's uh
02:58:50.28 --> 02:58:54.60 It's almost like you can kind of just refer to that every single time
02:58:54.60 --> 02:58:59.64 You know something's going wrong for you and probably others too. We be like well at least I didn't get shot 27 times
02:58:59.64 --> 02:59:02.60 You know true statement my thumb almost ripped off
02:59:03.32 --> 02:59:08.28 Yeah, it's weird you can keep or that he can keep his head straight when he looks down and be like oh
02:59:08.28 --> 02:59:10.76 Yeah, my thumbs almost off as well, you know
02:59:10.76 --> 02:59:18.12 Yeah, I said this I said team guy mode. Yeah, and I don't use that term lightly, but just from reading it and
02:59:18.92 --> 02:59:22.76 Talk new about it. He was in full team guy mode, which is when you're just like on it
02:59:22.76 --> 02:59:25.56 I'm gonna make things happen right now. Just yeah, so
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:28.68 Yeah, what we did well
02:59:30.20 --> 02:59:34.92 Speaking of excuse removal what do you think we can do to help
02:59:34.92 --> 02:59:44.04 ourselves and each other removes and excuses and stay on the path stay capable. I think stay capable
02:59:44.60 --> 02:59:49.88 Of course you're not gonna well we all have our challenges right like how you guys were saying
02:59:50.44 --> 02:59:52.44 uh
02:59:52.44 --> 02:59:56.76 Like people's challenges are more or lesser whatever, but there are
02:59:57.72 --> 03:00:02.04 We have like that's what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but there might challenge is or our challenges anyway
03:00:02.04 --> 03:00:06.36 So we're all gonna have our challenges, but we want to stay capable. Yeah, I think so
03:00:07.08 --> 03:00:09.08 With capability comes
03:00:10.20 --> 03:00:15.08 Exercise I think well you heard you heard Mike mentioned about a thousand times of working out
03:00:15.48 --> 03:00:21.72 Right staying in shape eating good food eating good food supplementation supplementation is a thing
03:00:22.52 --> 03:00:26.36 Very helpful thing anyway, so yeah supplementation jockel has fuel
03:00:26.36 --> 03:00:32.52 By what is supplementation jockel fuel so what kind of supplementation for your joints is a big one
03:00:32.92 --> 03:00:38.12 Keep your joints in the game my kids saw a guy do a backflip. It was a big muscle guy
03:00:39.16 --> 03:00:42.60 And he was doing a bunch of other stuff and there was a kid involved in the video and
03:00:44.12 --> 03:00:47.48 He was doing so and my daughter, you know she's curious she's seven so
03:00:48.20 --> 03:00:50.92 Everything the guy did she was like hey dad, can you do that?
03:00:50.92 --> 03:00:58.44 Mm-hmm and the answer was yes every single time she would be like hey prove it so I'd have to like prove it, you know and there was like a rope in it too
03:00:58.44 --> 03:01:01.72 So we I didn't have to prove that part of it and he she was like
03:01:02.60 --> 03:01:04.60 He was doing like a bunch of stuff and I was like
03:01:05.40 --> 03:01:10.68 It was the list was going on and on and I was like I was doing good at first but after while I started to get nervous like
03:01:10.68 --> 03:01:16.04 Bro this guy is pretty starting to get out side of your realm of capabilities. It looked like he was about to you know
03:01:16.04 --> 03:01:21.80 Cuz he just kept doing stuff and I looked at him. I was like using good shape one of those athletic shapes too
03:01:21.88 --> 03:01:26.60 muscle guy. I'm like okay, all right, all right, and then finally the last thing he did was this backflip
03:01:26.60 --> 03:01:30.04 Sort of the finale of the video like saying thanks for watching and he does a backflip
03:01:31.96 --> 03:01:34.92 And I remember back in the day I could do a backflip straight up
03:01:35.16 --> 03:01:37.86 What do you call it a tuck? I think it's called you know the kind of you
03:01:37.86 --> 03:01:39.86 Absolutely yeah, so
03:01:39.86 --> 03:01:45.62 But I'm like oh man if I were to bust out about backflip right now because of course you want to see right now
03:01:45.62 --> 03:01:47.62 I'd probably hurt myself
03:01:48.66 --> 03:01:52.18 But if I warmed up a little bit, I think I could do it right now
03:01:52.18 --> 03:01:55.78 I'm spreadsheet you can go for it at the pool's edge and say hey listen, P
03:01:55.78 --> 03:02:02.70 I can do it but I'm gonna do it over here by the pool just if because I'm cold right now
03:02:02.70 --> 03:02:04.94 See this guy warms up a lot. Yeah, that's all right
03:02:04.94 --> 03:02:08.26 That's actually what I said. It was like, yeah, he's warming up. Of course. You know, she's like okay
03:02:08.26 --> 03:02:11.62 So now everyone's gonna all show me like hey, just warm up do it before your workout
03:02:11.62 --> 03:02:16.26 You know like I got a bus I'll take excuse. It's been about 10 years since I did it
03:02:17.46 --> 03:02:22.62 And you can get hurt if you don't do it correctly. So the last thing I need is for me to double down and get
03:02:23.14 --> 03:02:26.74 injured in front of my daughter, you know kind of blow her whole image of me
03:02:26.74 --> 03:02:31.62 But she knows I can do it in the pool. Sure already knows that because I don't think I could get away from the pool thing on the less
03:02:33.06 --> 03:02:37.10 If I practice when she's not looking like in the pool or whatever, I'll pull it off
03:02:37.10 --> 03:02:39.98 But here's the thing I'm a little bit older now
03:02:41.14 --> 03:02:43.14 So my joints
03:02:43.94 --> 03:02:51.94 Could take a beating if I wasn't on that supplementation this one of the things I was thinking about as I'm explaining it to her like I could pull it off
03:02:51.94 --> 03:02:53.58 Just need to up your joint warfare
03:02:53.58 --> 03:02:58.78 Just I might have to you know just to first sit, you know for safety sake as it was
03:02:59.06 --> 03:03:03.46 Nonetheless, yeah, so take the joint warfare just in case somebody else you do a back flip for sure
03:03:03.46 --> 03:03:09.82 Talk whatever should not inside the pool or other things. Let's let's face each right a climber rope or something like this
03:03:09.82 --> 03:03:15.30 You should all just get hurt, but if you join so good you're good also krill oil super krill oil
03:03:16.50 --> 03:03:20.26 And also that vitamin D yeah get on that vitamin D
03:03:21.14 --> 03:03:23.14 Makes a little vitamin D with your cold war
03:03:24.42 --> 03:03:30.38 immunity system strong. Yeah, boost the immune system also milk. Yeah, I was gonna say don't forget about
03:03:30.38 --> 03:03:32.94 Discipline discipline go a
03:03:33.26 --> 03:03:37.42 Discipline powder we've got all kind of discipline. Yeah, a little bit of that
03:03:38.58 --> 03:03:40.58 When you need that little
03:03:41.90 --> 03:03:50.70 Accelerant yeah to kind of ignite things try it out. You might like it. Yeah, and the and the the juggle Palmer both
03:03:51.26 --> 03:03:52.54 Powder and the
03:03:52.54 --> 03:04:00.20 Can't I think sort of the leading flavor? It was the tropic one, but I think yeah, I think that kind of it's set in stone
03:04:00.20 --> 03:04:03.48 I think in my sour apple apple sniper
03:04:04.76 --> 03:04:08.94 Out right now by the way jade nails custom signature
03:04:09.56 --> 03:04:11.56 Jp Nell signature line
03:04:13.52 --> 03:04:17.80 What doesn't good deal. It's good too. I've tried you know, I try obviously I tried the
03:04:18.80 --> 03:04:23.56 sour apple sniper and it's really good. Yeah, it's gonna it's really good
03:04:23.64 --> 03:04:28.000 It's really good and yes, they've burq good deal. Yes
03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:38.52 He also has a flavor coming a signature flavor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, those are interesting too because you get this is the orange afterburner orange
03:04:40.96 --> 03:04:42.56 You um
03:04:42.56 --> 03:04:47.28 These energy drinks the RTD cans you kind of and I kind of forget this from time to time
03:04:47.28 --> 03:04:53.56 Two, I'm like okay, I need energy drink, but it's not just the energy drink you get the discipline and you don't get like for real chemicals
03:04:53.56 --> 03:04:55.56 Yeah, yeah, you don't that's that's so yeah
03:04:55.56 --> 03:05:02.10 There's no sugar in it. It's sweet with monk fruit still tastes good and but what's even next level is that it's pasteurized
03:05:02.10 --> 03:05:05.16 So there's no chemicals that keep things stable
03:05:05.32 --> 03:05:09.68 Which we had to go through a long period of of
03:05:11.88 --> 03:05:19.28 Testing and to find the place and to make this drink the way it is. So yeah check that out. Yeah, it's like a
03:05:19.28 --> 03:05:23.92 Um it'd be a disservice to call it a health drink
03:05:24.68 --> 03:05:27.64 Even though it essentially is a health drink
03:05:27.64 --> 03:05:35.08 You know what I'm starting to feel over here is that when we do a podcast like this where you don't say much during that podcast portion
03:05:35.64 --> 03:05:43.04 Maybe that sort of build some pent-up conversation where where you want to converse with you about stuff
03:05:43.04 --> 03:05:48.36 Oh, that yeah, and it seemed like you had plotted out a whole kind of topic here that we were gonna go into
03:05:48.36 --> 03:05:54.64 Yeah, you are gonna go right you know I feel it too, but and you know now that you mentioned that you're right
03:05:54.64 --> 03:05:57.36 You're actually yeah in real life you're right and here's what's crazy
03:05:57.52 --> 03:06:01.30 That's a long podcast. That's the challenge right? So I'm thinking okay cool
03:06:01.30 --> 03:06:04.62 Just in the front of our podcast and I'm like echo, you know
03:06:04.62 --> 03:06:07.12 We'll just kind of burn through people kind of know what's up
03:06:07.12 --> 03:06:09.02 They want to support the podcast. They're gonna get the game
03:06:09.02 --> 03:06:11.62 They know what to go to origin main.com. We can just kind of let them know
03:06:11.62 --> 03:06:13.92 But then we're talking about backfix
03:06:14.44 --> 03:06:16.44 That's what we're talking about
03:06:16.44 --> 03:06:20.10 Bro, you know how like okay, I see then what I do is I screw up isn't that I bring it up
03:06:20.10 --> 03:06:23.48 I should just keep my mouth shut be like up backflips cool. Yeah
03:06:23.98 --> 03:06:29.98 RTD up good where your kid moke get it yep, yeah, but I don't I think I
03:06:30.68 --> 03:06:36.60 Take the bait. I take the bait. It's kind of bait because 100% bait. Well, okay, so we're all at home
03:06:36.60 --> 03:06:40.64 You know a lot of us. I mean, you know some some of sort of going out a little bit more than others
03:06:40.64 --> 03:06:42.80 But like I'm one of the people I'm at home a lot
03:06:42.80 --> 03:06:48.44 So I take I talk to the same four people in my family varying levels of age. Okay, you know in maturity levels
03:06:48.52 --> 03:06:52.16 So after while it gets repetitive so when I see you, you know once a week
03:06:52.16 --> 03:06:58.76 I'm like hey man, let's do this talk. Let's face it and that's not that's a common thing like because sometimes we can go straight up two hours before we've been
03:06:58.76 --> 03:07:02.68 Pressure cord because we're you know whatever whatever and when you think about it
03:07:02.68 --> 03:07:08.36 I'm just realizing this just now like we kind of rolled in where you like kind of all business. Yeah, so you're correct. You know like that
03:07:08.36 --> 03:07:10.36 you've got a whole sort of like
03:07:10.36 --> 03:07:13.84 Excessive conversations floating in the air had to just
03:07:13.84 --> 03:07:16.56 Yeah, I've done all in the camera here with a zero
03:07:16.56 --> 03:07:20.40 I'd be just as soon like read off the stuff you tell where to go and we leave
03:07:20.40 --> 03:07:26.68 I'd be down with that. I understand. Okay. All right. Well, hey, let's beat it up, but hey, let's you know bear with me if you will
03:07:26.68 --> 03:07:28.04 So yes
03:07:28.04 --> 03:07:35.68 Discipline can powder all that good for your brain good for your body keep it keeping keep yourself on the path and capable by the way
03:07:35.68 --> 03:07:41.000 Mulk extra protein in the form of a dessert eating dessert like what ice cream or
03:07:42.92 --> 03:07:48.52 Snickers bars for dessert. I guess that's not really a dessert. That's my candy bar, but like a cake a bun to cake
03:07:48.96 --> 03:07:52.12 But don't do that. That'll take you up the path. Yeah
