00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 241 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I was the number one man on the door in my train, which meant I would be the first man into the room.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Mission's often included debates as to who would get to go first. All these guys were fearless and like to train hop to the front of the stack the most dangerous place to be first into a room.

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Seals love to fight. We all want to be the first into the fight, and every seal is willing to accept the greater risk, especially for his buddy's sake.

5
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I had no apprehension about the possibility of my own death. My concern was for my platoon mates.

6
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
While I can't speak for everyone, their actions this night prove they all felt the same way.

7
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Clarky and I looked at each other. He smiled back at me.

8
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We had practiced this maneuver a thousand times, and it successfully done it on hundreds of missions just like this one.

9
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There was no rush of adrenaline or anxiety.

10
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We were composed, relaxed, and professional.

11
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We would simultaneously breach our respective doors and go to work, clearing the rooms of enemy fighters and other potential threats.

12
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We launched on the signal, a mutual wave of our rifle barrels.

13
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I breached the door to my room. It's swung open to the right.

14
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I followed the door in as it opened, looked down the right wall, and saw it was clear.

15
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
As I pivoted off my right foot to move down the left wall, I had the sensation that my body was being slammed with a dozen sledjammers.

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My entire body was now in the room, and the men behind me in my room clearing train were attempting to follow me in.

17
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The room was small, 12 feet by 12 feet.

18
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
My night vision goggles illuminated the darkness, and I saw in clear view four of our targets aiming at me.

19
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000
All of them armed with automatic weapons, and all of them firing at me.

20
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That right there is an excerpt from a book called Perfectly Wounded by a retired seal named Mike Day.

21
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I knew Mike when he was a young seal. He was maybe ten classes ahead of me going through basic seal training.

22
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
He started his career at seal team three. I started my seal career next door.

23
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't know, 50 meters away, 100 meters away over at seal team one.

24
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We crossed paths on what was my first deployment.

25
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We'd see each other around from time to time.

26
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
He was always very cool to me from what I could tell always cool to everyone, nice guy.

27
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
No ego, no attitude.

28
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And on the day that Mike writes about in that book, those insurgents that were shooting at him, they hit their mark.

29
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And not just once, not just twice, not just three or four or five or ten times, but 27 times.

30
00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000
27 times, Mike was shot 11 times in his body armor and 16 times in his body.

31
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And you have to keep in mind, and this is a strange thing, but one single round or one single tiny piece of fragmentation can kill you.

32
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So to receive that many shots and survive is, well, it's some kind of miracle.

33
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And then to go beyond that, because the story doesn't end there, but to receive that many shots and actually fight back is beyond a miracle.

34
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And that's exactly what Mike did.

35
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
He fought back and he won.

36
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it is an honor to have Mike here today to tell us about his experiences, his life and his lessons learned.

37
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He's got a bunch of them.

38
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So Mike, thanks for coming on, man.

39
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I appreciate you guys having me.

40
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Yeah, getting you out here, I know we're in the middle of middle of COVID right now.

41
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You've been driving across country.

42
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I know you just got done with a total of all tree challenge up and up and Utah.

43
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I wish I could have grabbed you there, so you'd have to come all the way down here, but now you're telling me you're going to try and look to serve a little bit, which is awesome.

44
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Well, I'm trying to, that looks like this serves going to be picking up in Virginia since I'm not there.

45
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You got to hurricane coming up the gas the way it works, isn't it?

46
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You should have been yesterday.

47
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Well, hey, man, I want to jump into this. Your book is first of all, it's just, I mean, everyone, obviously I'm not going to read the whole book. I'm going to read some of it.

48
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Just go and go and get the book right now.

49
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The detail that Mike goes into, this is a historical document about being in the SEAL teams, about being in combat.

50
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And then what's in addition to that, the life stories that you bring to the table are important for people to understand, understand what, how people grow up in different situations, what it does to them, and how to get through those hard situations, because you definitely went through some hard situations.

51
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So I'm going to jump into it, man.

52
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Jump into this book and kind of talk about your past and how you grow up, and it starts off like this. He looked huge like a damn monster.

53
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
She was screaming and fighting back, which only made it worse.

54
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I was frozen in terror. He bent her arm over his knee and like a twig cracked it.

55
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I watched him break her arm. He yelled at me, go get me a glass of water. I ran to the kitchen, filled a glass and ran back to hand it to him. He drank it, then smashed the glass on a nearby table and held the broken shard like a knife.

56
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
He went after her again with this newly created blade. I jumped on his back to stop him.

57
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I think that's what finally snapped him out of his uncontrolled rage. I flew off him as he swung his arm and landed on the ground on my back.

58
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
He spun around to attack his unknown aggressor and realized it was me.

59
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I clearly remember seeing his expression dissolved from rage into one of guilt and shame.

60
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000
This is my earliest memory and my first encounter with a terrorist. It was 1976 in New Jersey and the terrorist was my father.

61
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
His victim was my mother.

62
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I was five years old.

63
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000
That's your earliest memory.

64
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
The shielding is very easy. He made it easy.

65
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is, I believe, pretty prevalent in our society now. A lot of us have just terrible parents.

66
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:42.000
One of the best books I've ever read is the Body Keeps Score. He says, in that book, the largest medical issue, the largest medical problem we have in this country, is childhood trauma.

67
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Because you learn what you are in the first seven years.

68
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:58.000
For me, luckily it wasn't to the point where I became more of a victim and worried about what things were going to happen.

69
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
My response was just to fight. So when I get scared or angry now, I fight when I get scared.

70
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
A lot of people want to get scared. The fight or fight is to coward.

71
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You can see in a lot of gun fights with people that aren't trained.

72
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
One of the most prominent places to get shot.

73
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Somebody that doesn't know what they're doing.

74
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And they're forearms in their hands.

75
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Because they're calorie.

76
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And our, when we get triggered, people know that you don't jump around a corner.

77
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Discarving me because I'm going to smack you. So I had to head. That's my response. I don't flinch. My response is to go forward.

78
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And, you know, my father ingrained that in me.

79
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And then I got in the seal teams. That was ingrained in me.

80
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And that night and that gun fight, there was no thoughts. That was all reaction. That was all muscle memory.

81
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I was terrified. I went through a terrified a little bit of terrified terrification. That's a new word.

82
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And once I got past that, it was just angry.

83
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And then everything was automatic.

84
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
You go on.

85
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You go on here in the book.

86
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
My parents divorced not long after my father broke my mother's arm.

87
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
My mother would soon start dating and eventually marry Tom.

88
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
A black man, a rare union in the 1970s.

89
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
My father held racist beliefs and my mother's marriage to a black man and flamed my father's racist sentiment.

90
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The divorce included a custody hearing.

91
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I was young, but I can distinctly recall someone in court, a lawyer, possibly the judge, asking me strange questions about Tom.

92
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Like, have you ever seen Tom naked? Have you ever seen Tom and your mother sleeping together?

93
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The focus of the custody battle, which should have been my father and his treatment of us, was instead trained on me, an innocent bystandard.

94
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Interracial relationships were not the social norm in the 1970s.

95
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm sure the court knew my father beat my mother and us kids, but they still awarded him full custody regardless.

96
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
My hunch is that the courts were so biased at the time that they decided my younger brother and I would be better off with a wife,

97
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Peter, an abusive father than be raised by an interracial couple.

98
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I'll speculation, but I mean, the 70s were not like that.

99
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Yeah, where was this?

100
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
This was New Jersey.

101
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Still New Jersey.

102
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And they still married and I got two brothers, one's in the Coast Guard from that marriage.

103
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And he's a rescue sorter.

104
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Oh, not a rescue. He's a crew chief on the birds that go out and carry the rescue swervers.

105
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So how old are you at this point? You must've been six years old or something like that?

106
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Yeah, I've already about that. I'm thinking, you know, when I picture you, I don't picture the old bastard that I seen in front of me right now.

107
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I picture this young kid.

108
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm like, I'm like blonde hair and you know, blue eyes.

109
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's the, when I open, I was like, oh, yeah, I know this guy.

110
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I'm not this one.

111
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Yeah.

112
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So I'm sure you're looking to be thinking the same thing. You know, my dad was driving around his house.

113
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We haven't changed that much really.

114
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.000
If I shave this.

115
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Yeah, yeah, no, you don't look that much different except for you used to have the freaking, the blonde blocks.

116
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Bright blonde blocks.

117
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
No, and I'm thinking, you know, there you are in court. This little Aryan kid.

118
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And the judges are looking at, you know, the the interracial couple.

119
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And like you said, I mean, you said it's a, what you said, it's an assumption.

120
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000
But to think of any other reason why they would decide to send you with a known child abuser is it's hard to come up with a different reason.

121
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Well, that's another reason why this books really good. I don't think anybody be able to pick that up. Nobody gets to this life without trauma.

122
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And it's, it's a lot more prevalent than I think we understand child abuse and

123
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Jesus, look at the child trafficking going on right now.

124
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I mean, there's just some really bad parents really bad people out there and people are going to suffer trauma.

125
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You got to build the resiliency. It's training.

126
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
They, they help us build the resiliency. We required to do what we did in the seal teams.

127
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And it's just training. If you sit on the couch and you twinkies all day and watch and watch TV.

128
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Anytime something other than that comes up that causes stress. You're just not going to be able to handle it. You got to train to be able to handle stress.

129
00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And then I mean, that sounds awesome. That sounds awesome. But the reality is, I mean, you're probably this small percentage of people that can get out of a situation like this and move in a positive direction.

130
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I don't know what the percentage is, but obviously there's some percentage of people that go through these traumatic experiences kids and they end up, you know, they end up in jail on drugs and whatever else.

131
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And yeah, I mean, there's something along the way that made you there's not a whole lot of difference between me and 80% of the prisoners here in California.

132
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I just had the proper opportunity at the right time.

133
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Because if I didn't join the Navy, I might. I, I beat Ronald and MS 13. I think I have to go after you.

134
00:14:43.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I think I'm after me. I, the, the amount of seals and this sounds freaking horrible to say, look, there's some guys that are saints and the seal teams for sure, but the amount of guys and the seal teams just if you just took a broad cut of the seal mentality, there is an element of criminal mentality in there.

135
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Like, oh, if you, if you want to join the Navy, we know where this is going to end up for sure.

136
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Well, we have to deal with criminals. Yes. I mean, a lot of people think that when we go to war, I'd venture to say that 75% of the people that we're dealing with are not ISIS or al Qaeda, they're just the criminal element that are profit, profitiers off of off of the current.

137
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I mean, look what we've got going on with whatever the missions going on. They, they, they, they, they logically, they don't care. There is, okay, I can make some money off of that.

138
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You know, you look at religion in this country. You know, got how many Christians and then what level are they practicing? You know, it's the same thing with Muslims.

139
00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Yeah, they're Muslim, but are they really practicing? Are they really going to follow what they think is right? Or are they going to take the path of least resistance, which is what humans will do?

140
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:15.000
You, you continue on here and fast forward a little bit. My father was a sailor. When the Navy issued him new orders, we moved to Pennsylvania from New Jersey after the divorce. My father remarried.

141
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Our new stepmother soon became pregnant, giving birth to my first half sister two years later. She gave birth to my half brother trauma attracts trauma.

142
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It has its own distinct language and behaviors. We would be raised by two people who've been severely traumatized as children.

143
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:45.000
My new stepmother was a natural fit for our family. She too had a history of childhood abuse both physical and mental. I don't know much about her the early years of her life other than her parents would lock her in a closet for long periods of time.

144
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:58.000
She was put up for adoption and taken in by loving couple. My stepmother would grow up to be both victim and perpetrator. She would alternate between coercing my father to beat us and slapping us around herself.

145
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:07.000
She and my father would get into their own fights too. She would fight back even though she had no way of winning. He was six foot two and weighed 240 pounds.

146
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
One of the worst beatings I ever endured was when I was eight. My brother and I had gone out on a winter day and tell the car was snowballs. The driver was pissed.

147
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
But if he'd known the price we'd about to pay for our transgressions, he may have given us a pass. We ran to our house with a driver the car chasing us. He knocked on our front door and told my parents what we had done.

148
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
My father and stepmother had a friend over at the time. They were all drinking. My parents were outraged.

149
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Our father sent us to the basement and ad hoc torture chamber of sorts where he made a strip naked before tying our hands to a pole so we were facing each other.

150
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
He whipped us with his belt so hard after another 15 minutes we'd worked up at he'd worked up a sweat.

151
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
All the while my stepmother and her friends sat on the basement steps,

152
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
sipping their booze, urging him to beat us harder and longer.

153
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
When he was done, my brother and I were both badly bloodied and bruised.

154
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000
My father's violence escalated as we grew. He would smear toothpaste on the nylon belt when he whipped us so we would sting as it cut and bruised us.

155
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I'm not sure where he picked up this technique but it worked.

156
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
His routine was to bring me into the basement and make me drop my pants so that my bear ass was available.

157
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
He would wind up and rip into my bear backside with that belt holding onto my arm as I twisted in a circle trying to escape.

158
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I recall a week that was preface with him telling us, I know that you will be bad kids this week.

159
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
He beat us bloody and then he went back to work.

160
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
This was some crazy stuff. He was so Nazi, he said,

161
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
As long as he was a lawyer and beat us for no reason whatsoever before he went to work,

162
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
we got beat and we went back to bed hardly a typical morning routine for a first grader.

163
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
My childhood was a real life horror movie I couldn't escape.

164
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
It was terrible about that.

165
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
A lot of people have worse.

166
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I got out of it. A lot of people don't.

167
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yeah.

168
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
We're the sends up. You say finally at the age of 12 after years of enduring a drunk and rages and endless beatings I decided to fight back.

169
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
When I'd found him passed out drunk on the couch,

170
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I knew that he was passed out because the crotch of his blue jeans was dark and from having wet himself.

171
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I grabbed a baseball bat and walked back and forth for about five minutes debating my intentions until finally I mustered up my courage.

172
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And with an overhead axe swing, I drilled him hard on the chest with the baseball bat.

173
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
It felt great, totally empowering rush.

174
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I didn't kill him, but I sure surprised him because he immediately woke up from his booze and diced black out with a look of total confusion.

175
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
That quickly turned evil. He looked at the bat in my hands and realized that I was what that was what just bounced out off his chest.

176
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I knew by the look in his eyes he was going to kill me.

177
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
He chased me upstairs to my room where I jumped out of my second story window into a thorny rose bush.

178
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I looked up to see my enraged father's stick.

179
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
His head out only to pull it back in.

180
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I could hear his pounding footsteps from outside as he ran downstairs.

181
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
He was determined to hunt me down, chasing me through the woods around our house in the dark.

182
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
He couldn't get through the thick underbrush, but I was too terrified to slow down. He never caught me.

183
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I spent the night at a neighbor's house in the next day when I returned home.

184
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
He had forgotten all about it.

185
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
In 1983, my father was transferred to Miramar near San Diego, California. That's where he totally lost it.

186
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
He was drinking, causing problems at work.

187
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
It had been arrested several times for defecating in the aisles of stores.

188
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Some mental health professionals describe this peculiar public display as elimination disorder.

189
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
It's a behavior that's been identified in several serial killers and manifest out of extreme anger at someone or something.

190
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I was 12 years old when my stepmother received word that my father would be medically discharged from the Navy and institutionalized with schizophrenia and a host of other psychiatric conditions.

191
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
He would spend the rest of his life in an inpatient facility or an assisted living environment.

192
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
My father has since died. He was very sick and really sick.

193
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And he did a terrible job as a parent. However, I know now that he did his best.

194
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
That he did the best he could. I don't hold any harsh feelings toward him.

195
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
He really sucked as a father.

196
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So I mean, it's just it's beyond or he had like legitimate serious mental issues.

197
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Well, his father was worse than him.

198
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
He just wasn't the one that was able to break the cycle.

199
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I think he tried to.

200
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Just ate him up.

201
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I mean, his father used to chase his, his brother and his sister around butcher knives and threatening kill him.

202
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
He never actually threatened the kill us.

203
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I mean, with that thought so is there.

204
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
His father used to actually make that threat.

205
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I never, I never met my grandfather.

206
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And what was your grandfather already dead or was quite honest, I don't know if they just kept us from him or or he was or he had passed.

207
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
I met his mother.

208
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:27.000
You know, looking back on that as a kid, it was strange. She was she's broke just the broken broken woman just strange.

209
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
You know, just not normal.

210
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
I mean, go over Thanksgiving dinner and everybody's eating Kentucky fried chicken, which I don't complain about it.

211
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I mean, you got food, but not going to complain with having food, but it was just.

212
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
It was not a normal atmosphere.

213
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
You could just feel that it was weird.

214
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
I mean, in his sister grew up in a psychiatric ward.

215
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
She went in when she was really early.

216
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Really young. So I don't know what kind of what was done to her.

217
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I mean, some serious darkness there.

218
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I mean, we got back going on now in the world.

219
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
It's pretty prevalent. You know, just shitty parents that abused their kids don't have to be parents because they were abused.

220
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Really not an excuse.

221
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
My kids tell me, well, I've got old kids.

222
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
You know, 20 year old and 29 year old. And they've always told me we wish you would spank us rather than yell at us.

223
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And I was like, it's because you never would spank.

224
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You might change your mind if you got a mass.

225
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
You go on here.

226
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I was about 12 or 13 years old and my stepmother became our legal guardian in season. Newfound freedom by dating a guy in a local rock and roll band named Beechie.

227
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And hosting parties at our house are home quickly turned into a constant party with its own inhouse band and all the characters that came with it.

228
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
People strangers would sit around my house all day getting drunk and stoned.

229
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I want particular occasion. My stepmother was partying with Beechie and his band of losers when she tried to smack me.

230
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I caught her arms spun it behind her back and swept the legs out from under dumping her on her ass.

231
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
That episode got me and my brother sent to Maine to live with our maternal grandparents who we hadn't seen in years for that summer.

232
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
My half siblings were still young at the time.

233
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I still remember looking over my shoulder and seeing my half brother lying in his crib and my half sister lying in her bed as I made my way out of the house.

234
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
I was just a funny thing about trauma because that's the only thing I remember those two.

235
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
We're not talking about now but it's as if they weren't even in the same house with us.

236
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I don't remember when they get in any different treatment.

237
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I don't remember that.

238
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
That's wild.

239
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And you were like two or three.

240
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.000
I don't know.

241
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
What team are you at?

242
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
I was a team two.

243
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Was a team one team two team.

244
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I'd rather did like eight years at team two from when the one.

245
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Sometime after 2010.

246
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
What year was gone?

247
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I got out in 2010.

248
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Yeah, I retired in 2010.

249
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
You just he was in the team for like ten years.

250
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
That's awesome.

251
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
But just no memory of them.

252
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
None at all.

253
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
That's the only thing I can remember is looking over my shoulder when I was walking out of the house.

254
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Now I can tell this is what I think about memories.

255
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Like I don't go back to the town where I grew up very often.

256
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And so I don't because I don't like fight but when I say very often, I mean for ten years at a time, right?

257
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
And I don't see all those people that I kind of grew up with.

258
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
So I don't fire those.

259
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And then the house comes right.

260
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I don't fire those memories very often.

261
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
So they just like fade and I'll go back there and see someone and they're like, Oh, yeah, I remember when you did this.

262
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
So I remember the memory of that girl and remember this and this thing over here.

263
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And I'm always like, I feel bad because they're telling me vivid stories about my own childhood.

264
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And I just don't remember.

265
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
I think it's because I just don't didn't fire those.

266
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
You can read studies on people's memories, especially in stressful situations.

267
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And I like I said my my citations and that accurate.

268
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
I think gave me credit for saving six women and children that were supposedly in the same room.

269
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
That was in a gunfight with four dudes with automatic weapons.

270
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.000
They'd all be dead.

271
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
The guy that saw that had looked past one of our guys that had been shot and killed.

272
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
To see the six women and children in a totally different room didn't even see the guy laying in the doorway.

273
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Just saw the six women and children and superimposed them in the room that I was in.

274
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
And I'll be dead.

275
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Hundreds and hundreds of rounds were fired in that room.

276
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
And a matter of minutes.

277
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
So now you had enough to me.

278
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
That fall my brother and I moved to Maine for Virginia Beach to live with our mother in her second husband Tom.

279
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000
It was only after we arrived that I learned about how my stepmother and father deliberately and systematically tried to alienate me and my brother from our mother.

280
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
She showed us a box filled with years worth of Christmas and birthday cards.

281
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
But they cards had been returned without the check she'd written for us.

282
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
My father and stepmother cast them all and kept them money for themselves.

283
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Despite this, I feel the same about my stepmother as I do about my father.

284
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
She survived my father's violence into the best she could.

285
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I don't hold any harsh feelings towards her either.

286
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Tom and my mother never hit us.

287
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
They were patient.

288
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Did their best appearance.

289
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Some severely abused young minds.

290
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
They were abused and lived in Virginia Beach all along.

291
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
But as I would learn everything happens for a reason.

292
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Never would made it through Buds.

293
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I had made it through eighth grade in entered green run high school where I lasted until my junior year.

294
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
When my resting coach caught me smoking pot in the school bathroom.

295
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
This caused my exposure.

296
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Is that a public school green run?

297
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
That's actually a very cool game run.

298
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I started to get kicked out of that one.

299
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Shortly after being expelled, I had to run with the police.

300
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Comp us me with a bag of weed at the time.

301
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Any amount over an ounce was a felony.

302
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
The cop grabbed the bag and said, is this an ounce?

303
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I said, yes, he opened the bag.

304
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Grabbed a pinch and chucked it onto the street.

305
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Then said, is this an ounce now? No, I replied.

306
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
That cop saved me from a felony charge.

307
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
I saved my life. I like to find that guy one day and thank him.

308
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
It was a good cop trying to take care of his freaking knucklehead kid.

309
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I was like 14 or 15 years old.

310
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
So from, so you can't do this.

311
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Almost 30 days in jail now.

312
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
It's very learn how to play, uh, what would it?

313
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Peanuckle.

314
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Played out a play bunch of card games.

315
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Oh, man.

316
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
So then you end up in space.

317
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
That comes in handy on the on the ships.

318
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Once you're in the Navy, um,

319
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
you ended up in the job core, which is like, you know, you're doing vocational training.

320
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Uh, that doesn't seem to work out to great.

321
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
1990 or 1980. You got a neighbor retired Navy diver who tells you you're going to end up dead or in jail.

322
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
If you keep this up, you should join the seal teams instead.

323
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
They'll pay you to do all the things you're doing to get in trouble right now.

324
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
It was, it was getting good advice.

325
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
And he totally saw it.

326
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.000
He totally saw it.

327
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
His kids were crazy in the me.

328
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Man, you know, there's that attraction of violence, man.

329
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And just may him when you're a kid.

330
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
What was violence?

331
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000
It was just, you know, tying ropes and one tree and low on another one and sliding down on handlebars and just jumping over ridiculous jumps on our bikes.

332
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
You know, smashing frames on the bikes and just stuff I wanted to admit to.

333
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
And so, uh, you, you, you had down and you're going to join the Marines.

334
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
I did. I tried to.

335
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And then you got rejected by the Marine Corps for having a GED.

336
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And I actually met a guy that was a recruiter back then.

337
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
And that wasn't 88 or 89.

338
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And then they had a restriction.

339
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
And they had to have a high school diploma.

340
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
A GED wouldn't get you in.

341
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Which I'm, my guardian angels knew.

342
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I'd have done four years in Marine Corps.

343
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Yeah. I couldn't have done that.

344
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
There's no way I couldn't have done that.

345
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Yeah. I mean, I like working with them.

346
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But pre 9-11.

347
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Marine Corps was a lot different.

348
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Yeah.

349
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Yeah.

350
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
We didn't get along too well.

351
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Pretty non-11.

352
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
The Marine Corps are a completely different environment. And, and, and, I mean, they do what they do.

353
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
It's actually more, it's more dangerous than what we do.

354
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Yeah. And their day-to-day life is freaking, uh, a more Spartan life.

355
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
You know, especially if you're an infantryman. Like, that's a troll contact.

356
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Yeah, it's a good song.

357
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
We tell so much, YouTube.

358
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.000
It's a little ghetto.

359
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I like the way to the air sleep.

360
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
That's the goal.

361
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Um,

362
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
You wrap up here saying,

363
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
My childhood was not exactly idyllic, but it's what happened to me.

364
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
And I'm very grateful for all of it. The wounds of my childhood trauma served as the foundation of some truly excellent resiliency training.

365
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
That's a very positive way of looking at this spike.

366
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Resiliency is a condition responsible in emotional trauma and stress.

367
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It's a never ending process of understanding endurance evaluation acceptance and application that continues to help me get through some very difficult situations.

368
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Childhood trauma, especially the kind perpetrated by parents, can be some of the most damaging because it can cause children to feel unlovable.

369
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Some children who feel unlovable can become unlovable adults and some of those become unlovable parents thus repeating the cycle.

370
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
The unlovable, live lonely tragic lives.

371
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
If my hurts mistakes but weapons and insights can help you overcome yours, then this book has value for both of us.

372
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
I'm not the only one with mommy and daddy issues.

373
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Check.

374
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I got some code of pregnancy shit going on.

375
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
You know, I tell people, uh, I mean, we all got insecurities.

376
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I don't know, maybe seals got insecurities.

377
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I just wanted the most insecure people on the other side.

378
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And then I try and sodium hard.

379
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Yeah, I was glad to anybody know I'm weak here.

380
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I was laughing to the teams if someone says, Hey, you know, Mike, Mike, Dave's really good at a pair of shooting.

381
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Someone will chime in the back. Yeah, but he's slow runner.

382
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Yeah, you're very exactly what's going to lead you to, but running breeds cowardice.

383
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
A bunch of cowards.

384
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so now you go to bootcamp to Buds after signing on the dotted line.

385
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
I spent the next six months working out. Do my best not to get trouble until I finally board the bus for maps and facility in southern Virginia.

386
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Maps is the waste station for all new military recruits.

387
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.000
There I found myself part of an interesting blend of Americana, one that includes all shapes sizes, colors and temperatures of young men, women who are leaving for the civil, leaving the civilian world.

388
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Getting the first taste of the US military. You know what that's an accuracy because I went to great lakes.

389
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Well, there you go.

390
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I did have a writer with me on this that one that was all dudes up there.

391
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
What about maps?

392
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Even even at maps.

393
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Yeah, they were sending all the women at the time to Orlando.

394
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Everybody goes to Great Lakes now. That place sucks.

395
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
What is maps?

396
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Military entry processing station.

397
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So you actually enlist and you wait a period of time before you go.

398
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
They just snatch you say you don't go out.

399
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Like do something else.

400
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.000
They don't actually have you.

401
00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Well, you're not under any kind of restriction or any kind of order under the UCMJ yet you sign a contract.

402
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And they give you a date that you're going to leave.

403
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
So I was on the on and that's for like six months.

404
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
I've talked to kids that then you know 18 months.

405
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
They hit some kid in high school.

406
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
You know, waiting for graduate.

407
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Get him young.

408
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I was 17 years old when I joined.

409
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
I knew I was the guy.

410
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
This is, I found this funny and this is also probably why you say that the Marine Corps wouldn't have worked out great for you over a long period of time.

411
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
It's you say I never in my life wanted to quit anything more than I did Navy bootcamp.

412
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Missable.

413
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Bro.

414
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Yeah.

415
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
I mean, there's a golden underwear.

416
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Oh, and great likes to January.

417
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Oh, get going forth.

418
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Five feet of snow 30 below.

419
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
I hate the cold weather.

420
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
I'd rather sweat.

421
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:06.000
You and you said I think the company commander saw some potential me and knew that I was bored because I kept volunteering to wake up at 4 a.m. to do what most people dreaded.

422
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
They decided to give me some extra responsibility.

423
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Made me the divisions recruit the divisions recruit mastered arms.

424
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
I was like, you're for when I was going through bootcamp.

425
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I got made like a squad leader or something.

426
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
I got fired from that one.

427
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Oh, bummer.

428
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.000
You guys, well, I talked about it in the book. The guy wiped the bugger on my pillow and it right as the company commander was walking in the door. I punched him.

429
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Yeah, it's so that.

430
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
So you got rolled back from the animation week of bootcamp.

431
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And then I get why I got rolled out of in Buds at a 166 and a 168 and I got rolled graduation week of 168.

432
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Just ironing to that.

433
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Then you made both made me cry.

434
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
So you got rolled back in in bootcamp, which I didn't even know there was such a thing as getting rolled back in there.

435
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
It was only one week though, which was cool.

436
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Oh, that's right because because you got a great lakeshore.

437
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
But you still had to do that stupid passenger view all that margin.

438
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Well, nobody was coming to visit me for graduation.

439
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I got into that fight because you put a bugger home at the low.

440
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I did knock him out. I did knock that kid out.

441
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Well, he was not a kid. I was a kid. He was a lot older than me.

442
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
And so I didn't have to do the passenger view. They just made me like a parking lot of tenant.

443
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
I didn't want to do it anyway.

444
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
All that practice.

445
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And we were in a Nazi company too.

446
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
They all that flags.

447
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
I remember those stupid flags for I don't even remember what they were for.

448
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
I actually best marchers best, you fold your underwear the best.

449
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Yeah, this is not like I am very limited memories of boot camp.

450
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.000
I hated it.

451
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Yeah, I know that I hated it.

452
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
But I don't remember a lot about it. Remember like the highlights of it.

453
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Probably the biggest. I remember just remember shoveling snow.

454
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
No, I definitely don't remember snowing snowing snowing.

455
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
I remember sweating. I remember like sweat.

456
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
A giant pool of sweat.

457
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
I remember the space shuttle took off while we were standing out there.

458
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.000
There was a space shuttle launch.

459
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.000
That's totally cool.

460
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.000
That was like that's cool.

461
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
But don't remember much from boot camp.

462
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
So you go from there to see school.

463
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
And then you get orders.

464
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Get orders to go to the USS carol vinsen.

465
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Yeah, I which is my first set of orders were to.

466
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
The carol vinsen via nukesyschool.

467
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
No machine is made.

468
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
So basically forever.

469
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
That doesn't know. That means hello regular Navy.

470
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
No no but no seal teams.

471
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
And I got to watch those guys go through school there.

472
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
That was at the same place. I was going through a school.

473
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
There were a bunch of zombies.

474
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Like 12 hours a class.

475
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.000
It's free.

476
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
It's free.

477
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Yeah, that's a decent freaking hard job man.

478
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
It's a freaking hard job.

479
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I got kicked out of a high school.

480
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I want to be a new guy.

481
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Whenever it was running your career.

482
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Consulting was not doing a great job.

483
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.000
They should have been lined.

484
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
You straight into the freaking buds.

485
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
But then you did you this is kind of crazy. Go you like requested captains mass.

486
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.000
No.

487
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I just went to his office.

488
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
So that's even better.

489
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
You didn't even request captain as you said.

490
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.000
I'm going to go talk to the old man.

491
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Yeah, kind of liking you know, I grew to you know,

492
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
What was her name that was up there for like longer than anybody was in the seal teams.

493
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.000
The secretary.

494
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Yeah, I talked to the secretary and I was like, I got a problem with my orders.

495
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
And I don't know how I got in there, but she let me get in there.

496
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And I think the guy was just amazed at some E2 who's coming to his office.

497
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Some food.

498
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
I'm like real good.

499
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.000
That's insane dude.

500
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And I told him, hey, like I passed the test for this screening test for buds.

501
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
There was 50 of us only like 10 of us passed.

502
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I was told I was going to get this on my contract.

503
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
And this is what I got.

504
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
It was like, do you understand that you're not supposed to be doing it this way?

505
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000
That's kind of how to comment.

506
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
I was like, I kind of played in between.

507
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I knew it was wrong.

508
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
But I didn't care.

509
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Because there was no way.

510
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I was going to New York City School.

511
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
So whatever I had to do, I was going to do it.

512
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And then the dude was cool and just said, alright, I need to care.

513
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
I got beat a little bit, but on beat.

514
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Not like buds.

515
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Do you ever try to count?

516
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.000
I'm going to push up.

517
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.000
She didn't want to die and buds.

518
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And you get up to a thousand.

519
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Did you ever?

520
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I tried.

521
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Really.

522
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
The 282 is hitting or 72's hitting the back of the head.

523
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Forget what you remember.

524
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
He's I drove the child once.

525
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And this guy didn't make it through.

526
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
He was such a big teddy bear cruise.

527
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Just couldn't run.

528
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And we were late for a child.

529
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
And out of all twig and beetle.

530
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
I was like, oh, we'll go get a child.

531
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
So last was already on.

532
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
So so now we're fast-wording the buds.

533
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
We're jumping to buds.

534
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Oh, man. So this is first phase. This was.

535
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I can't even remember.

536
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So you put the brakes went out on the thing.

537
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
The cross, the cross intersection at 75.

538
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So I crashed into that thing because my brakes go out.

539
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I only hit it like 25, 30 miles an hour.

540
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Both of us hit the windshield.

541
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Start the windshield.

542
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
When she'll doubt in the middle of 75.

543
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.000
As the buds class.

544
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
And the instructors drive by us.

545
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And like, oh, God.

546
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
15, 180 camp body builders that weekend.

547
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
That weekend. Both of us.

548
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.000
We cheated.

549
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
No, no, no.

550
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Yeah, sometimes you can't buy three.

551
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Sometimes you can't buy five.

552
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.000
You can't do 15.

553
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.000
I want to.

554
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.000
We're doing.

555
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Did you just stand out of the first phase outside the first phase?

556
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Office or something.

557
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Just sit there.

558
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.000
It was first.

559
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Yeah.

560
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.000
It was right by the bell.

561
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.000
How do you remember?

562
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Was it like, did you do like 750 a day or something like that?

563
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.000
No, we just.

564
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
When nobody was looking.

565
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
I just.

566
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
I just.

567
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Sometimes they sat in front of us.

568
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
We can't buy one.

569
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
As soon as they left, we're like.

570
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
I've 105.

571
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Did you have any idea what you're getting into when you went to buds?

572
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Like what comprehension level did you add?

573
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I basically.

574
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Yeah, I heard it was going to be hard.

575
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And that's kind of a mindset of always.

576
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
I've always gotten out of.

577
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And it works. I don't know if it worked for other people, but I always think it's going to be worse than it really is.

578
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
So a lot of times it just hard to get started.

579
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Like how good of a win?

580
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
I know you only were in high school for a couple of years.

581
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
But how good of a how good.

582
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Well, did you I know you wrestled?

583
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.000
I played football.

584
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I wrestled when I grew up.

585
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
I played all sports soccer.

586
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:33.000
I boxed a little bit.

587
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Hands of knockouts.

588
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I was just getting after it.

589
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I was always vicious.

590
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Just getting after it.

591
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I played basketball.

592
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Never really scored a point.

593
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
My coach would just think, I'll foul that guy.

594
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
So, so you had, so you had some good athletic background.

595
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Yeah, I liked playing sports.

596
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So you, but you had no knowledge of buds.

597
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Like, hey, not at all.

598
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Did you, did you think about?

599
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Like, I was, I was talk about, you know, when I was quote getting ready for buds.

600
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
No idea what to expect.

601
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I just knew that you ran a lot and you swam a lot.

602
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
So I ran a lot and I swam a lot.

603
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
But I would do, you know, four sets of pull ups and be like, alright.

604
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
You know, that was good workout.

605
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And it just had no idea that you were going to get the buds.

606
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
And you were going to do hundreds of pull ups in an hour.

607
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Like more than you could count.

608
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Well, they do.

609
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Don't expect you to be able to turn a 14-month run when you show up.

610
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Yeah, it is for the rest of the year.

611
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Yeah.

612
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I think they're even getting smarter about it now.

613
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
They're definitely getting smarter about it.

614
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
But, um, I should have.

615
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And guys are the guys are getting smarter about it.

616
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
I guess that's my point.

617
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
People will abuse it too.

618
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.000
What do you mean?

619
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
You can only keep me in the water for 10 minutes because the buds.

620
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
58 degrees.

621
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
When do you think that chart became a thing?

622
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Uh, after us.

623
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
We're, are you being serious?

624
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Like, do you think it is after us?

625
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Because I, it is for us.

626
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Yeah, I mean, they were just, it was no freaking rules.

627
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
They probably looked at the student body as a curve.

628
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
And if somebody won the I put their me on the OK,

629
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
I mean, me the take about.

630
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I remember that part.

631
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
I remember them walking down the line and being like,

632
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
You can hear me like, I feel like this is pretty good.

633
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
They shine the flashlight.

634
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Yeah, I'm never going to get this guy's get nip in.

635
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
But if no, if you didn't hear that, then it's like back in the water.

636
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
And they would just keep you doing that until someone started getting hypothermia.

637
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Maybe two people started getting hypothermia.

638
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Then they'd be like, on to the next evolution.

639
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
There wasn't no graph that they were following.

640
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
No, they do now.

641
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I think it's good.

642
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
There's good and bad to it.

643
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I wish the students didn't know it.

644
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
That's part of the game.

645
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Not knowing.

646
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And you also met your wife while you were in fourth phase of the old fourth phase.

647
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Because it was your, basically, standing might a class up.

648
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
I don't know what they call it now.

649
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Fourth phase.

650
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
It's still called fourth phase.

651
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
So you were there, which is weird.

652
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
And that's when you, you met your future wife.

653
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:17.000
And then rolling into first phase.

654
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Drown proofing.

655
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
You can't rescue swimmer life saving.

656
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Yeah.

657
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
So I did work with the writers.

658
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So some of the stuff is, is changed a little bit.

659
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
It's a whole process to go into this.

660
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
What is that word program?

661
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
That you got to use when you're editing.

662
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Sometimes somethings just get by.

663
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Like, man, I can't figure this program.

664
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Yeah, it's, uh, it's the plus when you look at something over and over again.

665
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
You're just going to miss stuff and happens.

666
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Well, and when you work with us today and stuff that they think is interesting.

667
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Uh, is, I'm like, do you want to talk about this?

668
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Check.

669
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
So there was something that the guy worked with, uh, felt was interesting.

670
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And, and he get the proper terminology.

671
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
And because to me, drown proofing was, we didn't lose many people to that.

672
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Yeah, drown proofing.

673
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Drown proofing was pretty easy.

674
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
You mean, you lost a few of the guys.

675
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Yeah.

676
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
There's a few guys in not tying.

677
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Lose a few guys and the writers were in the water swam.

678
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
We did lose a few guys in life saving.

679
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Because life saving was so interesting.

680
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Because it was a subjective thing where they could look at a guy and be like, hey, this guy,

681
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
we don't like this guy.

682
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
They're just trying to drown.

683
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Yeah.

684
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
And then they've gone to drown you and you, they don't like you.

685
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Because they have that power.

686
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Um, team, do the whole waste push and go down there and tug on or shit and make them comply.

687
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
It's a scrap.

688
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
For sure.

689
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
It is.

690
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I mean, that's what they described.

691
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
You don't let them grab onto you.

692
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
You got to get them away from you and sometimes you got to hurt them.

693
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
They're going to get punched to the gut.

694
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
You know, they'll calm them down.

695
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
They definitely, they're going to live.

696
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
There were some guys that do what they just weren't going to make it.

697
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
You know, like a guy that they didn't like or whatever had a bad attitude or they thought it was a punk.

698
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
You're one going to get out of the water.

699
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Those people have a history too.

700
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
It's not just one evolution.

701
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
It's a third pet of four performance.

702
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Yeah.

703
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I think that it seems like there's, you think there's structure about that now where there's less subjectivity.

704
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Or you think it's the same.

705
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Well, I would just have to say that I know there's some things that have changed.

706
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
And a lot of guys we like, I think buddhist easier.

707
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
But the attrition rates the same.

708
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Yeah.

709
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
So they're not making any more seals.

710
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
No.

711
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
I mean, even with a class that's twice the size, I mean, we would start with like 125 guys to get 20.

712
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Mm.

713
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Now they're starting with 200 something.

714
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Yeah.

715
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Well, I think they start with 165 and they still get whatever whatever.

716
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
They're still only getting percent of that as.

717
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
They're still only getting that.

718
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
It's still 75% of nutrition.

719
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
So it's still.

720
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
I don't think it's any easier than it used to be.

721
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
No, I think it's not.

722
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:56.000
I think it's not.

723
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I talked to friends that are down there.

724
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
They're like, no, it's not easier.

725
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
The other thing that's like one of the evolution might be different that's like, for instance, when I went through we had 272s.

726
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
They're not as buoyant as the 28.

727
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
So it was a little bit harder to tread water with those damn tags because they're steel.

728
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
And they weren't as in buoyant.

729
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
They know what else they wear on like lightweight boots now, not jungle boots, not old school jungle boots.

730
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
That was a difference too.

731
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
That when I was going through is everything was in boots.

732
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Yep.

733
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
They were getting ready to transition to the shoes.

734
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So the times were different.

735
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And almost didn't translate.

736
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
You know, going from boots and then lowering the times because you're in sneakers.

737
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
It was almost hard.

738
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Yeah.

739
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I just know we wore boots.

740
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
And then when I eventually picked up what they started wearing, I was like,

741
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Oh, that's way nicer.

742
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Yeah.

743
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
They were going to shameless those garbage new balance, which gave me shin sports.

744
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Oh, just the running shoes.

745
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Yeah.

746
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Like when you, they didn't.

747
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000
My legs were better off in boots than running sneakers.

748
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Mm-hmm.

749
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
The sneakers hurt me more.

750
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
So it was what a 710 pace.

751
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
That's not bad.

752
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
And boots.

753
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yeah.

754
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
But the thing, that's the other thing that's,

755
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
what is it?

756
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
The thing that's deceiving about buds is they go, hey,

757
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
it's only a 32 minute 4 mile time run.

758
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
That's an 8 minute mile when you first get there.

759
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
You go, oh, that's why I can get that no problem.

760
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Just in two miles from this morning.

761
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
You just do miles from the 288.

762
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And then it's five miles.

763
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Just five miles to go to Chow three times a day.

764
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
You run five miles every day just to eat.

765
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Yeah.

766
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
And not to mention that 4 mile time run.

767
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Eight four miles.

768
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
I don't know what they do now.

769
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
But I know that we're tied to our run as far as I could.

770
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
I wouldn't be able to I would be like barely passing.

771
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Well, they do that to every class.

772
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Yeah.

773
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
They have that one run that's long.

774
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
So everybody fails.

775
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
It's my game.

776
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
We were doing the five mile time run.

777
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And that extra mile was so much harder exponentially.

778
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Just to put out for that much longer, just one mile.

779
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And they actually had to get rid of that because it was injuring people.

780
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
And a lot of people were failing it.

781
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Crazy.

782
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
That's what they were paying me on trying to get me kicked out.

783
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
But I brought it watch.

784
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
That was passed.

785
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Yes.

786
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
So how did that happen?

787
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
So you brought a watch because that's another thing that's hard.

788
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
You don't know.

789
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
You don't know.

790
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
And we were running in the U.T.

791
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
So what phases is this?

792
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Do you remember?

793
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
This is third phase, which was die phase back then.

794
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
And so you failed one run?

795
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
He was failing me on all and everybody behind me.

796
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Okay.

797
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
So you had a B for the instructor?

798
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
With, and we're not going to mention names, but he was the phase officer.

799
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
And, you know, you know, the game that used to be played there in room inspections.

800
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I mean, you're going to fail.

801
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
You're going to get went and Sandy.

802
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
And he was in front of me and he was like, why do you have all this stolen equipment in your locker?

803
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

804
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
So he's talking about like extra knives, duties, and CO2's garbage.

805
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Right.

806
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
And I was like, I don't have any of that stuff in my locker.

807
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
I was just up there.

808
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And the conversation just got to the point where he was like, well, one of the two things

809
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
is happening.

810
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
And you're lying or I'm lying. I was like, well, it's not me, so it must be you.

811
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
But it wasn't like a disrespectful thing.

812
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
I was answering a damn question.

813
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
I was just answering his question.

814
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
He said one of the one of the two things is happening.

815
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000
What is it?

816
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
I was like, well, it's not me.

817
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000
It must be you.

818
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Damn.

819
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
E2.

820
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
To a narcissistic lieutenant.

821
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Yeah, at the time.

822
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
That's freaking crazy.

823
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
You had like, you had more balls than me going through.

824
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
But that wasn't balls.

825
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I was just answering a question.

826
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
I don't know, man.

827
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I don't know if I would have said, I didn't eat me.

828
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I guess it depends on how you said it, too.

829
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
It was not coming from a place to disrespect.

830
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
I was just totally answering the damn question.

831
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
You were just like, I'm not lying.

832
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
I'm not lying.

833
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
It's you.

834
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
You asked.

835
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
I'm answering your questions.

836
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
So he didn't like that.

837
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
And so now he kind of had it out for you.

838
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
And then he's sick that guy we were talking about earlier on me.

839
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
So he started just harassing me.

840
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
You know, third phase was a lot of classroom.

841
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
You know, dive physics and all that garbage.

842
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
But every break I was getting went and Sandy doing poems, doing push-ups.

843
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
He was just beating me up and then he started failing me on the runs.

844
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
And I told him I didn't look.

845
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
I think I actually named him guy named Doc Flynn.

846
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Oh yeah.

847
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
I went and told him I was like, hey, look, I brought a watch.

848
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
They're failing me.

849
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
I'm passing these things by like two minutes and they're failing me.

850
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
And everybody behind me.

851
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
That's kind of a weird move because you were breaking the rules.

852
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Well, I had to.

853
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Yeah, I know, but that's a weird move, man.

854
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
That's weird move to be the one who's done it though.

855
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Yeah, I went and talked to the commanding officer.

856
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Yeah, dude.

857
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Like I said, you got more balls than I had.

858
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I just didn't know any different.

859
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Yeah.

860
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
I wasn't doing it because I thought it was having balls.

861
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
I was just, I don't know how else to get out of this.

862
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Fix this.

863
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
So you're not allowed to bring a watch.

864
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
And you brought a watch.

865
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
You timed yourself.

866
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Yeah, I tied it to the, I remember the buckles on the 80s.

867
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Yeah.

868
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
I tied it to a piece of like 550 cords.

869
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
I'm gonna hang it down there.

870
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Cool.

871
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000
And so you pat, and how did you sync the loud doc Flynn as the guy that you would trust?

872
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
He was just one of the guys in the phase that really never beat us up for no reason.

873
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
He seemed like a fair dude.

874
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Yeah, I mean, there was two kinds of instructors there.

875
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
There was guys hiding out that never really did anything.

876
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
And then there was guys that back in those days too.

877
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
There was a whole lot going on.

878
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
But guys that were operational that just needed a break.

879
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
So, you know, some of them just beat us up just because they thought they were the gay keepers.

880
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
You know, kind of like going to some of these armors schools.

881
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
I'm the gay keeper.

882
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
We have to have an iteration rate.

883
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
I mean, I'm gonna make sure you go through something that's hard as I used to.

884
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Or I did because their fish story is,

885
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Buds was a lot harder when I went through.

886
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
And this guy was a skinny little punk.

887
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
But he later got a minister and he separated.

888
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
That was something else he'd done.

889
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
So, the car was a bitch.

890
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Yeah.

891
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
So then, but Doc Flynn was like, alright, cool.

892
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
And then he ran the next run.

893
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And he said, I'm gonna run run run the pace.

894
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
And if you finish in front of me, he passed.

895
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Doc Flynn legit.

896
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
So he ran it.

897
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
And this was a five-mile time run, which they got rid of.

898
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
He came across the finish line and you know what happens when you're the cutoff guy.

899
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
How many times can you be the cutoff guy every day on time?

900
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Yeah.

901
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Now, that's one of my LPO's who you know.

902
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
He probably, you know, when I used my first LPO.

903
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And I was like, coming out of Buds and asking him,

904
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Buds questions, like, did you ever, were you ever in the Goons squad?

905
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
And he was, I was the cutoff of the Goons squad.

906
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
He said every single run, he was kind of like the Goons squad.

907
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
You know what?

908
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000
That was the only time I got into the Goons squad to the whole time through Buds.

909
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
But was all those time runs.

910
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And what I was good at was winning that first race.

911
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And you see, you get secured from the Goons squad.

912
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Yeah.

913
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
So then, so then what happened?

914
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Uh, well, he came across the finish line.

915
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And when you're cut off for the Goons squad,

916
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
you get sent to the water.

917
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
And that's where you wind up when you fail that run.

918
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
He comes across, you know, a couple minutes after we finished and we're getting hammered.

919
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
And he was like, what's going on with those guys?

920
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
And he was like, well, they all failed.

921
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And Flynn was like, I just did it.

922
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I just passed it.

923
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
They're like two minutes in front of me.

924
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Um, but it got hidden because I went to a review board and still got rolled back.

925
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I got rolled back.

926
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
That was graduation week.

927
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And I got rolled back to Dragherface.

928
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
At least I didn't have to do the open circuit garbage again.

929
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Yeah, this was when this was when die phase was third phase.

930
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
When I went through a year or two later,

931
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
die phase was second phase because they still get rid of a lot of guys during die phase.

932
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Yeah, it's that to me.

933
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
I thought it was the hardest phase.

934
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Die phase?

935
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Yeah.

936
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Yeah, I think I think that's why they moved it to that.

937
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Well, we lost more people there.

938
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
We don't lose people in line warfare.

939
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Yeah.

940
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Yeah.

941
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Yeah, I got to be pretty stupid.

942
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
I think we lost two guys.

943
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Yeah, we pretty stupid.

944
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Yeah.

945
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
One of the guys was a good dude.

946
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
I think he did something that they didn't like.

947
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
And they got rid of them.

948
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
He was an officer too.

949
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Personal.

950
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
Yeah.

951
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
I don't happen.

952
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Crazy.

953
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
That's a pretty critical community.

954
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
It self-regulates though.

955
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
We're those.

956
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Indeed.

957
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
And then where do you at?

958
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000
SQT.

959
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Did you go through, you went through STT?

960
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Right?

961
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Well, it was kind of a weird one.

962
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000
It wasn't.

963
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
SQT like it is now.

964
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
It was kind of thrown together at the team.

965
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Yeah, because you went to team through it.

966
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Yeah, but they cooperated with the other teams.

967
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
So I went through whatever they go.

968
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
I think it was called STT.

969
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
It's done.

970
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
And it was just, because we had training cells at each of the teams and they would run it.

971
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Yeah.

972
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
So we were meshed together with team 1-3-5.

973
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
And it was kind of ad hoc.

974
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
And then they jammed us into bulltoons and the bulltoons pretty much still care of us.

975
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
We didn't have our tridents back then.

976
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Either guy showed up at the teams now with the tridents.

977
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
We actually had a different NEC when we was at a 53-20-20.

978
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Yeah.

979
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Then it was up to your bulltoons to decide when you got it.

980
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Well, they started giving the guys tridents in SQT.

981
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
So they'd show up to the team.

982
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Guys were taking the new guys that showed up with their tridents and making him pay him.

983
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Painting him blue for him.

984
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
They're in there.

985
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000
But they still kind of kept the tradition.

986
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Like you can go back in the bulltoons now.

987
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
The bulltoons with the new guys.

988
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
So like you don't get your trident even though it's been put in your admin record.

989
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
We're not going to give it to you until we say it's.

990
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
And then they'll have like the fish tank or you've seen one of those pack man frogs.

991
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
I've seen a pack man frog with all the tridents in it.

992
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
They got to keep the frog alive.

993
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Oh, that's legit.

994
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
It's a fun community.

995
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Yeah.

996
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
And there's, you know, you talk about some of the fun in the community.

997
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
That's college I ever went to.

998
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Yeah.

999
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Some of the fun of the community which is called hazing.

1000
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
You're a tolerance that never happens.

1001
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Yeah.

1002
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Yeah.

1003
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
I see that's a good thing about hazing.

1004
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Especially probably now also.

1005
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
I know there's a zero tolerance and it doesn't happen.

1006
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
But if you don't get hazed, they don't like you.

1007
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
They don't trust you.

1008
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Yeah.

1009
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
So if you get hazed, you know, like I'll get this guys.

1010
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
So it's like a privilege.

1011
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Thank you, sir.

1012
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Can I have another?

1013
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Okay.

1014
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
There ain't a nothing in her.

1015
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Not a noffy yet.

1016
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
One of the things you said here is you're getting your bird.

1017
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
And this all sounded good.

1018
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
I just, this brought back memories.

1019
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
The, the commanding officer was the last guy to pounded my tried and he had a big grin

1020
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
on his face as he approached.

1021
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
He pulled the tried and out of my body.

1022
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Because this is after you, we want to get your tried and, you know, well, we still

1023
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
quarters.

1024
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Two.

1025
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Yeah.

1026
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
I don't know who paid, I thought so.

1027
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000
I think it was my cartoon commander.

1028
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
But though anyways, the whole team freaking lines up and pounds that thing into your chest.

1029
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
You know, though, that doesn't hurt.

1030
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Yeah.

1031
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
I mean, well, okay, maybe didn't hurt you.

1032
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
I mean, I mean, the punch, but you actually feel the prongs after the first eight.

1033
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
You know, you're bleeding.

1034
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
But then, but then, guys start pulling it out.

1035
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Oh, it's a little crooked, Jocko.

1036
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
And they get you again.

1037
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Bad hurts worse.

1038
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
But what I like, yeah, it's got like those little nubs on the end of the world.

1039
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
It's a little wiggits attached to.

1040
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Yeah.

1041
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
When you pull it out, you can feel it pulling your chest.

1042
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Coming out.

1043
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
But you say you're commanding officer.

1044
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
He pulled the tried and out of my body straight.

1045
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Did like he was fixing it up a bent nail.

1046
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Then he placed it on my chest and slowly pushed it back in.

1047
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
That hurts worse.

1048
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
I was going to say that's freaking good times from the old man, right?

1049
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
There.

1050
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
That's the back of the days where the back 40 was.

1051
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
We're out of two adjustments.

1052
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
We're made.

1053
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Yeah.

1054
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Now you're going on peacetime deployment.

1055
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
You say this.

1056
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
My peacetime deployments took me around the globe.

1057
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Asia, Middle East, Egypt, Kuwait, Japan, Korea, Guam, points beyond.

1058
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
And in between, connecting joint, country, country, training.

1059
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
All my deployment to Bahrain.

1060
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
We patrol the Persian Gulf and forcing oil embargoes.

1061
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
We would board oil tankers that were in violation of various infractions.

1062
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Most of the time, the infractions that they didn't identify themselves because they're

1063
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
radioed in work.

1064
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
We were catchers.

1065
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000
We were catch tankers bearing the Iranian flag.

1066
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Filled with embargoed Iraq oil.

1067
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
All sorts of shenanigans going on.

1068
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
So would you do four deployments?

1069
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
What'd you do in that first run at team three, four, four?

1070
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
And the first one was Southeast Asia.

1071
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
That was like right after the Gulf War.

1072
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Would you go to the PI?

1073
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000
I went to the PI.

1074
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Yeah.

1075
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
So then I think your network happened so fast.

1076
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
We couldn't get there.

1077
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Then you end up, you're, it looked like you were going to go to Buds and be an instructor.

1078
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Yeah.

1079
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But you actually had orders.

1080
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
You had orders to Buds.

1081
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And then what, what, how did you, how did you hear about the Leap Frog trial?

1082
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I was just by chance.

1083
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And I only had like 30, 35 jumps.

1084
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
That's insane.

1085
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I had no idea what I was doing.

1086
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
That's insane.

1087
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I mean, those guys, at that time, had thousands of jumps.

1088
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Well, there was, there was some guys on that team that had, what was that program?

1089
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We used to have our own, what we still do, the original freeball program that we had.

1090
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Which is the military freefall that was out.

1091
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Like three something, three M3T.

1092
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I can't remember about it.

1093
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
But it was our own program out there at El Saito.

1094
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
That's, that's untrue.

1095
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah.

1096
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
You know, so a lot of those instructors were on the team with me.

1097
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Dwight Saito, the anti crowd handle,

1098
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Oh, Glagiacs, they all had a couple thousand plus jumps.

1099
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, those guys, I'm talking about like they were freaking out.

1100
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
30.

1101
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So you decided, hey, what the hell, I'll go get a bunch of jumps in.

1102
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I know, I was making it.

1103
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I was thinking, I got like 45 jumps, try outs with the cool parachute.

1104
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And then you ended up making it.

1105
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Yeah, well, it was freaking crazy.

1106
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Glagiac told me he could teach a monkey to fall out in their plane

1107
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
to be out in the bananas.

1108
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That was, I didn't think I was going to make it.

1109
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I thought I was going to bust.

1110
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And I really didn't want to.

1111
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The jump team was, was some of the most fun I had.

1112
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Probably one of the most dangerous jobs I had until combat.

1113
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yeah, the jump team at that time, man, they were pushing the envelope hard core.

1114
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah, we had some injuries.

1115
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We had a death when I was on the, on the jump team.

1116
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I remember I was doing like my, whatever my jumps to get my gold wings.

1117
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
When I first got the team, like I didn't, I tried it,

1118
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
but they sent me down to the freaking brown field to go get some jumps.

1119
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And the jump team was jumping.

1120
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And they did like a down, I'd never seen a free fall person in my life.

1121
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Never seen a free fall jump.

1122
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And I landed and got my shoot all packed up or whatever.

1123
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And then income the leap frogs.

1124
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And they did a down plane.

1125
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
They were going to thousand miles an hour as far as I could tell.

1126
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And I, they were so straight down.

1127
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And I, I could hear them say break.

1128
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah.

1129
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And I was like, holy shit.

1130
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
This is insane.

1131
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:17.000
We had a guy.

1132
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Sheed himself.

1133
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
He broke too low and went into this stadium,

1134
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
which at the time was Jack Murphy.

1135
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
That was a long time ago.

1136
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It was.

1137
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And he hit like four seats and ripped them out of the ground.

1138
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Those things are bolted into the crown and the crown creed.

1139
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And he walked away from it.

1140
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Yeah, it was Tommy Markey.

1141
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Yeah, which is no Tommy.

1142
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

1143
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You could hit that dude upside the head with a bat.

1144
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
What a beast.

1145
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
He's gone now.

1146
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
He's going to be.

1147
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Couldn't hurt him.

1148
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Yeah, no, that's what I mean.

1149
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
He's just a monster.

1150
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And nice.

1151
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That he's there too.

1152
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Yeah.

1153
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You got this little section here.

1154
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
While we were falling towards your three guys doing all kinds of crazy jump.

1155
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And while we're falling toward the earth, another guy and I had to crawl out from

1156
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
underneath canopies to clear airspace.

1157
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So you guys were doing crew relative work.

1158
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You're all freaking wrapped up.

1159
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I can't say exactly how fast we were falling as we were as there were fully and partially inflated

1160
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
parachutes, but even slowly falling out of the sky can be deadly.

1161
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I was still recovering from the tear of my first cut away when my second happened a few days later.

1162
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Me and another guy got tangled up and caught in the helicopter spin.

1163
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
The deployment bag retraction system on the tops of our parachutes and somehow got entangled together.

1164
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
We were twirling around opposite each other, falling.

1165
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
He was looking directly at me and I and him and we yelled back and forth at each other.

1166
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Cut away.

1167
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
No, you cut away.

1168
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Like the world's most high-stit game of rock paper scissors he won and I cut away.

1169
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
He's a good long time friend of mine.

1170
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
He's a big pussy.

1171
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
He should have cut away.

1172
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
He was scared.

1173
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I don't even know how that happened.

1174
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
How you guys got all wrapped up?

1175
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I know how the wrap happened, but our parachutes got connected to each other was ridiculous.

1176
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Those are canopy relative work parachutes.

1177
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Usually when you open a parachute there's a trailing pilot sheet.

1178
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
While on those because you're doing career you don't want that stuff trailing.

1179
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
It has a retraction system on a three-ring retraction system.

1180
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It pulls it up to the top skin of the parachute.

1181
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And that's what got connected on both of ours.

1182
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It was a wrap.

1183
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
We were doing like eight man stack rotations.

1184
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Guy peels off the top and flies all the way to the bottom.

1185
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That's how it started.

1186
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And you get into a wrap like five six dudes.

1187
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Some get shot out.

1188
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And some get wrapped up.

1189
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And everybody broke out of that and we were just stuck.

1190
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And did it happen on film?

1191
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
No, because we, you know what, back then.

1192
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
There was no such thing as a girl GoPro.

1193
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
GoPro.

1194
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I mean, guys were still taken.

1195
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I think I remember going from Paul Robinson was one of our camera guys.

1196
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And he had this giant enormous freaking.

1197
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
When he opened those spares, you got the whole this head.

1198
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
His, his, his, his head down because he had all this weight up there.

1199
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Break his neck.

1200
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Now they used to jump.

1201
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It wasn't film.

1202
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
So I think we had a high eight, which is a pretty large camera.

1203
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It's not GoPro.

1204
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Any clown can jump a clope.

1205
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So, uh, that blow tubes on the camera.

1206
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
You had to take a picture.

1207
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Oh, that was like a radical.

1208
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That's how you, uh, take a fire.

1209
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Oh, no kidding.

1210
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You'd have to start the camera before you went out.

1211
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
But the still camera because they would have a video and a, and a still and they had a blow tube.

1212
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
You have to blow into the tube to take a picture.

1213
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And then you had a radical here.

1214
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I remember seeing guys jump those little radicals.

1215
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So they do wear their aim.

1216
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Yeah.

1217
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Crazy.

1218
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Yeah, you guys were pushing the envelope back then with the, with the jump team.

1219
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
You did three years there and then you go back to the teams.

1220
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And would you go, did you go to, you went to East Coast?

1221
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I wanted to teammate.

1222
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
What year was that?

1223
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Uh, 99.

1224
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Check.

1225
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And you, and that was Kosovo.

1226
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah, I was going to say you rolled on there.

1227
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Um, NATO was allied with the ethnic Albanian forces and we were tasked with working with NATO

1228
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.96
to assist them in apprehending suspected to war criminals and keeping eye out on the movements of various

1229
01:06:27.96 --> 01:06:29.96
warring, foreign factions.

1230
01:06:29.96 --> 01:06:31.96
Kosovo was a real world test.

1231
01:06:31.96 --> 01:06:36.96
We would do 72 hour special reconnaissance missions in rugged terrain full of natural man made threats.

1232
01:06:36.96 --> 01:06:44.96
We did 25 S.R. missions in six months averaging about one a week with one day of prep three days on a debrief on the other end.

1233
01:06:44.96 --> 01:06:46.96
It was a kick in the butt deployment.

1234
01:06:46.96 --> 01:06:50.96
And conventional forces don't react to anything inside of 72 hours.

1235
01:06:50.96 --> 01:06:51.96
Yeah.

1236
01:06:51.96 --> 01:06:53.96
It's better to sit around.

1237
01:06:53.96 --> 01:06:54.96
Yeah.

1238
01:06:54.96 --> 01:06:55.96
That's, that's still.

1239
01:06:55.96 --> 01:06:58.96
At that time doing real missions was awesome.

1240
01:06:58.96 --> 01:06:59.96
Well, we thought that was the game.

1241
01:06:59.96 --> 01:07:00.96
For sure.

1242
01:07:00.96 --> 01:07:01.96
For sure.

1243
01:07:01.96 --> 01:07:03.96
You can't bond still.

1244
01:07:03.96 --> 01:07:06.96
You can get the restrictions that they had on the guys out there.

1245
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:07.96
It was ridiculous.

1246
01:07:07.96 --> 01:07:10.96
I mean, they had to put,

1247
01:07:10.96 --> 01:07:12.96
rigorous tape over their magazine.

1248
01:07:12.96 --> 01:07:14.96
Well, they had to put rigorous tape over their magazine.

1249
01:07:14.96 --> 01:07:16.96
Um, who?

1250
01:07:16.96 --> 01:07:19.96
Everybody that was out there were supposed to do that.

1251
01:07:19.96 --> 01:07:20.96
We didn't do it.

1252
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:21.96
Um,

1253
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:23.96
I mean, it's not unusual to have.

1254
01:07:23.96 --> 01:07:26.96
They had to do to had an idea at the front gate with a 50 cal.

1255
01:07:26.96 --> 01:07:27.96
Okay.

1256
01:07:27.96 --> 01:07:29.96
But that's their clearing process.

1257
01:07:29.96 --> 01:07:31.96
At the end, they pulled the trigger.

1258
01:07:31.96 --> 01:07:32.96
Yeah.

1259
01:07:32.96 --> 01:07:33.96
Yeah.

1260
01:07:33.96 --> 01:07:36.96
Why do you kind of pull the trigger to clear and save a weapon?

1261
01:07:36.96 --> 01:07:37.96
Well, at least you got it.

1262
01:07:37.96 --> 01:07:38.96
I hope you had to point in the safe direction.

1263
01:07:38.96 --> 01:07:39.96
He did.

1264
01:07:39.96 --> 01:07:40.96
Okay.

1265
01:07:40.96 --> 01:07:41.96
We'll think it.

1266
01:07:41.96 --> 01:07:44.96
You ever seen a 50 cal sheet 10 feet in front of you?

1267
01:07:44.96 --> 01:07:48.96
Uh, I'm pretty impressive.

1268
01:07:48.96 --> 01:07:51.96
So that's 99 come back from that point.

1269
01:07:51.96 --> 01:07:53.96
Again, I'm skipping a bunch of stuff here.

1270
01:07:53.96 --> 01:07:55.96
Really cool information about what those deployments were like.

1271
01:07:55.96 --> 01:08:00.96
That's why people got to buy the book to get some of those details.

1272
01:08:00.96 --> 01:08:02.96
Jump and head a little bit.

1273
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:05.96
Uh, reported to Naval Special Warfare Group 2 training

1274
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:09.96
Detachment on September 8th, 2001.

1275
01:08:09.96 --> 01:08:13.96
New instructor role be there for two years.

1276
01:08:13.96 --> 01:08:15.96
That was the week.

1277
01:08:15.96 --> 01:08:16.96
9 11.

1278
01:08:16.96 --> 01:08:17.96
Yeah.

1279
01:08:17.96 --> 01:08:18.96
I was going to say September 11.

1280
01:08:18.96 --> 01:08:20.96
So you just check in to trade at.

1281
01:08:20.96 --> 01:08:21.96
Nobody wanted to go there.

1282
01:08:21.96 --> 01:08:22.96
Of course not.

1283
01:08:22.96 --> 01:08:23.96
When.

1284
01:08:23.96 --> 01:08:25.96
When did you start the model now?

1285
01:08:25.96 --> 01:08:28.96
When did you uh, what were you teaching?

1286
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:29.96
I kind of bounced around.

1287
01:08:29.96 --> 01:08:30.96
I got over there.

1288
01:08:30.96 --> 01:08:31.96
Did all the air stuff.

1289
01:08:31.96 --> 01:08:32.96
Uh, at first.

1290
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:35.96
Then I didn't land warfare.

1291
01:08:35.96 --> 01:08:36.96
And uh, CQC.

1292
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:39.96
I just kind of bounced around all the way to the place.

1293
01:08:39.96 --> 01:08:40.96
Yeah.

1294
01:08:40.96 --> 01:08:45.96
I mean, trade at has become such a great place to develop seals.

1295
01:08:45.96 --> 01:08:47.96
I mean, it really is.

1296
01:08:47.96 --> 01:08:51.96
And back in the day, like when when you and I first got to the team, I don't know

1297
01:08:51.96 --> 01:08:53.96
one wanted to be in training cell.

1298
01:08:53.96 --> 01:08:54.96
And I did.

1299
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:55.96
They all got it.

1300
01:08:55.96 --> 01:08:56.96
They all weren't.

1301
01:08:56.96 --> 01:08:57.96
Yeah.

1302
01:08:57.96 --> 01:08:58.96
They did.

1303
01:08:58.96 --> 01:08:59.96
They did.

1304
01:08:59.96 --> 01:09:00.96
They did.

1305
01:09:00.96 --> 01:09:01.96
They all mashed a team.

1306
01:09:01.96 --> 01:09:02.96
That's one master.

1307
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:04.96
So you couldn't figure out what the mashed team did in the seal teams.

1308
01:09:04.96 --> 01:09:05.96
Yeah.

1309
01:09:05.96 --> 01:09:06.96
I'll tell you.

1310
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:08.96
I got some good advice from some of those old mashed.

1311
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:08.96
She's in one officer's that would say, like, hey, if you want to learn this stuff, you've got to go teach it.

1312
01:09:08.96 --> 01:09:09.96
Yeah.

1313
01:09:09.96 --> 01:09:12.96
And I was lucky enough to go into training cell at CQC.

1314
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:14.96
One spent a couple years there.

1315
01:09:14.96 --> 01:09:15.96
And it was, I did.

1316
01:09:15.96 --> 01:09:16.96
I learned.

1317
01:09:16.96 --> 01:09:23.96
I figured out the other day I had made some estimate, like 50% of what I learned in the entire teams was

1318
01:09:23.96 --> 01:09:25.96
was working for whatever it was.

1319
01:09:25.96 --> 01:09:28.96
Three years or two and a half years in training cell at CQC.

1320
01:09:28.96 --> 01:09:29.96
One.

1321
01:09:29.96 --> 01:09:30.96
And what's in 10 groups do the same thing?

1322
01:09:30.96 --> 01:09:31.96
10 groups do that.

1323
01:09:31.96 --> 01:09:35.96
What the teaching teaching junior officers that are going through STT, how to do an eye-ad.

1324
01:09:35.96 --> 01:09:39.96
Like how what to react in these different situations and then watching them and seeing the mistakes they make.

1325
01:09:39.96 --> 01:09:41.96
That was 40% of what I learned.

1326
01:09:41.96 --> 01:09:45.96
Another big chunk of what I learned was when I was a trade-at later on.

1327
01:09:45.96 --> 01:09:47.96
You know, same thing.

1328
01:09:47.96 --> 01:09:48.96
You're teaching guys.

1329
01:09:48.96 --> 01:09:49.96
You're watching them do it.

1330
01:09:49.96 --> 01:09:50.96
You're seeing the mistakes.

1331
01:09:50.96 --> 01:09:51.96
They make.

1332
01:09:51.96 --> 01:09:52.96
You're putting them through drills.

1333
01:09:52.96 --> 01:09:54.96
You're seeing the same platoons go through the same training.

1334
01:09:54.96 --> 01:09:55.96
Evolutions.

1335
01:09:55.96 --> 01:09:56.96
What the leaders do.

1336
01:09:56.96 --> 01:09:57.96
What mistakes they make.

1337
01:09:57.96 --> 01:10:01.96
So yeah, going into training cell and training attachment is a great step.

1338
01:10:01.96 --> 01:10:05.96
And it's a great system now because guys go they, you know, they get there and

1339
01:10:05.96 --> 01:10:07.96
E5 and then they go there.

1340
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:09.96
They make E6 and then they go in there and put two now peel.

1341
01:10:09.96 --> 01:10:10.96
They just got done teaching the stuff man.

1342
01:10:10.96 --> 01:10:11.96
They're ready.

1343
01:10:11.96 --> 01:10:12.96
They're almost the time.

1344
01:10:12.96 --> 01:10:15.96
Well, they're getting there a little bit faster than we used to also.

1345
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:16.96
Yeah.

1346
01:10:16.96 --> 01:10:20.96
Yeah, it's a little it's way more formalized the way it all works now, which is freaking

1347
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:21.96
Good for them.

1348
01:10:21.96 --> 01:10:22.96
Well, I just left trade-at.

1349
01:10:22.96 --> 01:10:23.96
I was a contractor there.

1350
01:10:23.96 --> 01:10:28.96
Well, when I left the care coalition after seven years, I went to teach in military

1351
01:10:28.96 --> 01:10:31.96
Freefall, head and injury and then went to CQC south.

1352
01:10:31.96 --> 01:10:32.96
Yeah.

1353
01:10:32.96 --> 01:10:37.96
And it was interesting seeing guys that when I was the platoon chief are now like leaders.

1354
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:38.96
They're a member.

1355
01:10:38.96 --> 01:10:39.96
Guys, it was a little re-six.

1356
01:10:39.96 --> 01:10:43.96
When I was a platoon chief, for now master chiefs and some of the new guys are doing their

1357
01:10:43.96 --> 01:10:48.96
Platoon chief slot and was fun to watch and watch them go through and it's always terrified too.

1358
01:10:48.96 --> 01:10:53.96
When I was doing my platoon chief slot, you know, like I said, we have Aaron security.

1359
01:10:53.96 --> 01:10:54.96
I didn't want anybody to get hurt.

1360
01:10:54.96 --> 01:10:58.96
I want to make sure I provided everything that the guys needed.

1361
01:10:58.96 --> 01:11:04.96
They used to tell me when I started the micromanage, hey, chief get out of my back pocket

1362
01:11:04.96 --> 01:11:07.96
because you can't manage all that crap.

1363
01:11:07.96 --> 01:11:14.96
And quite honestly, the words guys that were more experienced that were junior to me when I was in charge.

1364
01:11:14.96 --> 01:11:22.96
And then you just got to know when you know what you don't let the people that are more experienced,

1365
01:11:22.96 --> 01:11:24.96
you know, take those reins.

1366
01:11:24.96 --> 01:11:28.96
Yeah, and you got to be, you got to have a confidence in your leadership that you know,

1367
01:11:28.96 --> 01:11:31.96
oh, you're, hey, you've done this sort of thing before you run it.

1368
01:11:31.96 --> 01:11:32.96
No fact or no problem.

1369
01:11:32.96 --> 01:11:33.96
Good to go.

1370
01:11:33.96 --> 01:11:35.96
Oh, my crommandaging hurts.

1371
01:11:35.96 --> 01:11:36.96
Oh, yeah.

1372
01:11:36.96 --> 01:11:40.96
I'm just freaking, it's a disaster, a lot of hours.

1373
01:11:40.96 --> 01:11:48.96
Uh, so um, so then you get done with trade at, you go to team four, your, your,

1374
01:11:48.96 --> 01:11:51.96
you go, you go on deployment.

1375
01:11:51.96 --> 01:11:52.96
Where'd you go?

1376
01:11:52.96 --> 01:11:53.96
Baghdad?

1377
01:11:53.96 --> 01:11:54.96
Oh, yeah.

1378
01:11:54.96 --> 01:11:56.96
You go, you go into Baghdad.

1379
01:11:56.96 --> 01:12:01.96
I know you got to do some team four at the time was actually, they had nine details.

1380
01:12:01.96 --> 01:12:02.96
Which was huge.

1381
01:12:02.96 --> 01:12:06.96
Nobody nobody in the field teams wanted to do the PSD.

1382
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:07.96
Yep.

1383
01:12:07.96 --> 01:12:14.96
So yeah, for people that don't know, one of the major taskings at the SEALteams got in 2005.

1384
01:12:14.96 --> 01:12:15.96
It's the 4500.

1385
01:12:15.96 --> 01:12:16.96
I think it's 4500.

1386
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:16.96
The 42500.

1387
01:12:16.96 --> 01:12:22.96
Everyone got the job to protect the senior leadership of the new Iraqi government.

1388
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:23.96
Everyone.

1389
01:12:23.96 --> 01:12:24.96
Well, not everyone.

1390
01:12:24.96 --> 01:12:27.96
But a whole bunch of people wanted to kill those guys.

1391
01:12:27.96 --> 01:12:31.64
The people that got the job to protect him was the seal teams

1392
01:12:32.12 --> 01:12:41.16
So that's what you know you did in then of course. There's a whole lot of things that that are that are wrapped up and doing that because

1393
01:12:41.16 --> 01:12:46.56
If you're proactive about it that means we're gonna go try and capture bad guys or kill bad guys that might be trying to target our people

1394
01:12:46.68 --> 01:12:51.000
We're also doing intelligence gathering. We're going out and figuring out who's trying to kill these people?

1395
01:12:51.84 --> 01:12:56.16
That's a great setup. That's what I did. Yeah, I didn't do the actual entering your protection

1396
01:12:56.16 --> 01:13:00.32
I was far outering looking for threats that were going after

1397
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:08.96
targets within those PSDs. Yeah, yeah, and we had nine and they all want every everyone of those politicians

1398
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:10.96
I want my Navy Seals

1399
01:13:11.76 --> 01:13:13.76
We don't want to work with you people

1400
01:13:14.32 --> 01:13:18.80
Yeah, that was a harsh harsh one harsh pill to swallow for a lot of guys. I got lucky

1401
01:13:18.80 --> 01:13:23.52
I was it started right after I left and it ended before I came back

1402
01:13:23.52 --> 01:13:30.32
Well, I think it all got turned over there. There's actually military units that that's what they do. Yeah, we got turned over to them

1403
01:13:30.32 --> 01:13:32.32
Yeah

1404
01:13:32.32 --> 01:13:38.000
You did have some good times on that when here we go. We were speeding down the road and slid do a left turn as soon as we we made the corner

1405
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.24
I nearly smashed into a makeshift roadblock

1406
01:13:40.40 --> 01:13:44.32
We must have been moving too fast as we caught the roadblock construction crew off guard. We still had there

1407
01:13:44.72 --> 01:13:47.12
Who still had their AK strapped to their backs?

1408
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:52.96
The friends at all taken up positions on the right side of the road and had their weapons trained on us ready to shoot

1409
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:59.04
Is we spring it around the corner and split second the construction crew found themselves in a very awkward position pinned between us

1410
01:13:59.28 --> 01:14:04.24
Their friends and their friends who wanted to shoot us in the confusion. We managed to get the jump on them

1411
01:14:04.72 --> 01:14:06.72
the lead humvee

1412
01:14:07.12 --> 01:14:09.84
Was equipped with a mini gun those things are all

1413
01:14:10.56 --> 01:14:17.36
I never we never got it. I know I have to use a certain level of reverence when I say that because it is so awesome to have a mini gun on on there

1414
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:24.56
And the gunner had the reflexes of a mongous 40 feet away the targets and their rifle-wielding friends

1415
01:14:24.56 --> 01:14:28.24
I had a front row seat to the action when the gunner opened up on all of them

1416
01:14:28.24 --> 01:14:33.04
I had not seen a mini gun in live combat before so I was a little surprised by what happened next

1417
01:14:33.84 --> 01:14:37.28
By the way, there's nothing mini about a mini gun. It's a pedestal mounted six barrel road

1418
01:14:37.28 --> 01:14:40.16
Remachine gun that chooses many a 6,000 rounds of

1419
01:14:40.72 --> 01:14:46.32
7.62 by 51 every minute and the bull is about the size of a triple-A battery

1420
01:14:46.32 --> 01:14:51.68
But let's spit so fast fast out of the gattling style rotating barrels that it look like a red laser beam

1421
01:14:51.68 --> 01:14:55.12
And sound like the mating call of some bizarre prehistoric bird

1422
01:14:55.60 --> 01:15:00.72
The first volleyable it's hit one guy in the chest as he practically vaporized and a bird burst of red mist

1423
01:15:01.28 --> 01:15:07.68
As this was going on about 50 yards up the road and another enemy fighter popped up and fired an RPG directly at the lead humvee

1424
01:15:07.68 --> 01:15:11.20
The one that was firing the mini gun. I couldn't see the RPG but I saw the humvee

1425
01:15:11.52 --> 01:15:15.04
10 feet in front of me lift up drop back down with a crash and catch on fire

1426
01:15:15.04 --> 01:15:22.08
The gunner didn't even flinch. He just kept on shooting in 30 seconds the 25 or so ambushers including the RPG

1427
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:27.68
Triggerman had all been killed and were all red piles of flesh spread over the street when it was

1428
01:15:27.68 --> 01:15:33.12
Overweigh secured the area salvaged what we could from the still burning humvee and then destroyed it with a thermite grenade

1429
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:39.60
The mini gun turned 25 human beings into shredded flesh and less than a minute that was quick. I thought

1430
01:15:39.60 --> 01:15:44.16
And then I felt weird because the next thought I had was that was awesome

1431
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:48.000
Awesome because we did not get killed then because the power of the mini gun

1432
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.96
It was this was the first time I had seen people in the process of dying

1433
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:56.16
But it was not the first time seeing dead people my life and training it prepared me for these situations

1434
01:15:56.16 --> 01:15:59.20
My constant inoculation of violence and stress made what would have been

1435
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:06.24
Grow task and unbearable to many and acceptable situation to me my trauma had conditioned me to accept the unacceptable

1436
01:16:06.24 --> 01:16:11.76
That's what war does it changes the way you view the world. I found no pleasure whatsoever in killing the enemy

1437
01:16:12.32 --> 01:16:14.72
However, this was an outcome of war

1438
01:16:14.72 --> 01:16:18.88
Everyone at some point was someone's child, but that thought is lost in war

1439
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:25.44
The most profane aspects of war is that it deletes the humanity from humans

1440
01:16:25.44 --> 01:16:31.52
It's pretty much forget about everything you believe

1441
01:16:33.28 --> 01:16:38.56
You know, you're not thinking about that when you're in a gunfight. Do the allergy religion

1442
01:16:39.76 --> 01:16:41.76
Political whatever sticks

1443
01:16:41.76 --> 01:16:43.76
Dude's trying to kill me

1444
01:16:44.88 --> 01:16:46.88
I'm gonna work on him

1445
01:16:47.28 --> 01:16:49.84
You get home from that deployment and then

1446
01:16:49.84 --> 01:16:54.24
Then then you did that when you get rolled into doing a platoon chief?

1447
01:16:55.52 --> 01:16:57.52
Yeah

1448
01:16:59.04 --> 01:17:01.04
Do you work up

1449
01:17:01.84 --> 01:17:03.84
How's it work up?

1450
01:17:03.84 --> 01:17:05.84
well

1451
01:17:07.36 --> 01:17:09.04
The work up prior is pretty interesting

1452
01:17:09.60 --> 01:17:13.44
Because I interfaceed with all the guys that were going to be in the platoon was a platoon chief and

1453
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:17.52
I remember breaking one of the guys nods on right before and up

1454
01:17:17.52 --> 01:17:20.88
He didn't know it was gonna be a platoon chief. He kind of cheered me out

1455
01:17:21.52 --> 01:17:24.000
I was like, Dave, don't put your stuff on the ground. I want stuff on it

1456
01:17:27.20 --> 01:17:32.24
I did feel stupid about that but the work up is you know pretty pretty standard we were on an 18-month cycle

1457
01:17:32.24 --> 01:17:34.24
I think on that one

1458
01:17:34.24 --> 01:17:39.28
I think it was 18-month cycle so it's a year long work up you know broken up into three into three parts

1459
01:17:39.28 --> 01:17:41.28
You know, pro-to-have everybody going to schools

1460
01:17:41.28 --> 01:17:46.32
um and ULT just doing all the standard

1461
01:17:47.04 --> 01:17:49.04
T-C-C-South

1462
01:17:48.88 --> 01:17:53.12
Air did you guys know that you were going to Iraq when you hadn't formed up?

1463
01:17:53.12 --> 01:17:56.32
We were kind of the bastard children too everybody was looking for the shiny object

1464
01:17:56.32 --> 01:17:58.32
Not the time that was some task force and

1465
01:17:59.92 --> 01:18:01.92
We got what was

1466
01:18:02.72 --> 01:18:07.44
Thought to be the least of the shiny best deployments which was fulusa

1467
01:18:07.76 --> 01:18:09.92
And they the guys that were there weren't doing anything

1468
01:18:09.92 --> 01:18:15.20
But we worked different we worked intel different than they did and we were really busy

1469
01:18:15.60 --> 01:18:17.92
And I did 140 DAs on that deployment which is

1470
01:18:19.60 --> 01:18:24.64
Talked the guys in the sealed teams to do 100 DAs on the deployments unheard of

1471
01:18:26.24 --> 01:18:28.24
And then on top of that

1472
01:18:28.80 --> 01:18:34.48
Teaching medical classes to the military units that there the you know second fourth Iraqi army brigade and

1473
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:38.48
Teaching tactics and how to patrol and trying to work with the mid teams

1474
01:18:38.48 --> 01:18:40.48
It's you know

1475
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:47.28
When you run a target for your regular job it's kind of hard to come and be a mid team and in full use of proper

1476
01:18:48.08 --> 01:18:51.44
Yola and run a military unit especially when I don't speak English

1477
01:18:52.08 --> 01:18:54.08
Because their standard of work is not what

1478
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.36
No, it is not

1479
01:18:57.36 --> 01:19:05.76
And I was one of the hardest things for us to get to was we when we first got there we we had these expectations that they were going to get to the level that we were at least close and

1480
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:10.24
That's just not gonna happen you got to see okay this right here

1481
01:19:10.48 --> 01:19:12.96
This is what we wanted to be at but right here's got to be acceptable

1482
01:19:14.80 --> 01:19:19.28
It's kind of like you're us over there. Yeah, you got to definitely adjust your standards in a real big way

1483
01:19:19.28 --> 01:19:22.000
Yeah, but it's kind of cool because I'm thinking about you know your last

1484
01:19:22.16 --> 01:19:27.12
Your previous deployment where you were kind of gathering a lot of intel and stuff like that and then you roll out because

1485
01:19:27.52 --> 01:19:32.56
As you know we drive our own operations and if you can make you can find intel and you can put it together

1486
01:19:32.64 --> 01:19:35.04
You can put up a target package. Let's go hit it, you know

1487
01:19:35.04 --> 01:19:41.84
That's you know to get that to get a bunch of DA's down like that. It's not the sexy thing to do the hard part

1488
01:19:42.24 --> 01:19:46.32
It's getting the target packages put it together the fun parts going out and hitting almost team guys

1489
01:19:46.32 --> 01:19:49.68
I just just show me what door. I don't even care to show me what the door

1490
01:19:51.12 --> 01:19:57.36
It's a lot harder to get the information so you're on this deployment you're doing all these DA's

1491
01:19:58.64 --> 01:20:00.64
And now we're gonna get into

1492
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:04.96
April

1493
01:20:04.96 --> 01:20:06.96
2007

1494
01:20:06.96 --> 01:20:07.92
Northeast of

1495
01:20:07.92 --> 01:20:09.92
Felicia when the shooting stopped

1496
01:20:11.04 --> 01:20:13.76
I was still on the floor lying on my left side

1497
01:20:14.48 --> 01:20:17.36
So this is picking up where we started the this whole

1498
01:20:18.80 --> 01:20:20.80
This whole podcast out

1499
01:20:21.52 --> 01:20:26.32
When the shooting stopped I was still on the floor lying on my left side I pushed myself up to my knees

1500
01:20:26.32 --> 01:20:30.08
I don't remember hearing any the gun fire, but now the sounds began to register in my ears

1501
01:20:30.08 --> 01:20:35.92
The two men who had stacked up directly behind me in my room clearing train where our Iraqi scouts

1502
01:20:37.12 --> 01:20:40.40
The second man in our train took around to his chest plate and

1503
01:20:40.80 --> 01:20:44.80
An knocked him clear out to the foyer. Ironically that round may have saved his life

1504
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:50.08
He'd originally been with an arms length behind me as we'd entered the room the third man in my stack

1505
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:56.24
Had been shot as he entered the room an AK 47 rounds smashed through his bulletproof chest plate

1506
01:20:56.24 --> 01:20:58.24
He'd fallen dead in the doorway

1507
01:20:58.24 --> 01:21:05.92
The chance factor was insane once fired a bullet can be unpredictable the internal milling of a gun's barrel causes bullets to

1508
01:21:05.92 --> 01:21:13.20
Spin and flight some bullets will begin to tumble through the air at low speeds while others are designed to tumble in cartwheel after hitting a target

1509
01:21:13.60 --> 01:21:15.60
Which can cause some brutal damage

1510
01:21:16.24 --> 01:21:21.20
It's likely that we were all hit by the same type of bullets at nearly the same time shot from the same gun

1511
01:21:21.60 --> 01:21:26.96
But the damage to each of us was significantly different a balance of my room clearing train five or six other guys

1512
01:21:26.96 --> 01:21:30.80
hadn't been able to get in the room because of all the volume of fire

1513
01:21:33.36 --> 01:21:35.36
I moved from my knees and stood to my feet

1514
01:21:37.44 --> 01:21:43.52
I felt like there were 200 pounds on my back. I took off my helmet and used the white light on my damage pistol to survey the room

1515
01:21:43.68 --> 01:21:48.96
One of our other Iraqi scouts entered the room. He had been behind Clarkey and followed him into his room

1516
01:21:48.96 --> 01:21:53.52
The bullet that hit Clark bypassed all three of the Iraqi scouts stacked up behind him

1517
01:21:53.52 --> 01:21:59.52
These three made into Clarkey's room and a gotten trapped in the back of the house when the shooting started

1518
01:21:59.52 --> 01:22:06.64
The scout had been part of the original group of ten recruits who had been with us since the first day. He spoke decent English and gave me a report

1519
01:22:10.40 --> 01:22:12.40
One seal killed an action

1520
01:22:12.40 --> 01:22:24.88
One Iraqi scout killed an action two detainees and six women and children

1521
01:22:26.72 --> 01:22:29.20
At this point I actually didn't realize that they had left

1522
01:22:31.20 --> 01:22:33.20
It didn't register yet

1523
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:41.68
We started getting reports about what had happened during this

1524
01:22:43.36 --> 01:22:46.48
I just remember thinking this is just

1525
01:22:47.36 --> 01:22:49.36
This is just a pure insanity

1526
01:22:51.36 --> 01:22:53.36
A lot of guys felt guilty for leaving me in there

1527
01:22:53.36 --> 01:22:58.40
But I had to talk to a lot of guys like we didn't do anything wrong that

1528
01:22:58.40 --> 01:23:02.56
Nobody saw me going there you guys followed protocol that we would always follow

1529
01:23:04.08 --> 01:23:07.68
You didn't blow up the house because you didn't have a full head count did that right

1530
01:23:08.64 --> 01:23:10.64
You know so everybody did everything right and

1531
01:23:11.52 --> 01:23:15.68
I don't know I in a study sometimes with a knee jerk reactions that we would have to

1532
01:23:17.36 --> 01:23:22.56
Try to make everything as safe as possible which we're good at but even if you do something

1533
01:23:22.56 --> 01:23:27.76
Everything's right bad things can happen you just can't you know

1534
01:23:28.48 --> 01:23:36.96
Can't minimize all the threats to the point where there's no more threat you just can't do it and you can also do really dumb things and make big mistakes and everything turns out perfect

1535
01:23:37.04 --> 01:23:39.60
You know and you can do everything perfectly things go wrong

1536
01:23:40.32 --> 01:23:42.48
Perfect plan goes to shit in the first 30 seconds right

1537
01:23:47.04 --> 01:23:49.04
Rewinded a little bit this is what you said

1538
01:23:49.04 --> 01:23:56.24
It was surreal like something out of a movie time slowed down almost to a stop and everything happened in super slow motion

1539
01:23:56.64 --> 01:23:59.84
Almost as if I were watching a scene unfold frame by frame

1540
01:24:00.24 --> 01:24:03.92
Second scene like minutes a slow motion torn a bullets flew at me

1541
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:07.04
I could clearly see all the bullets coming at me

1542
01:24:07.44 --> 01:24:10.64
I had total auditory exclusion there were no sounds

1543
01:24:10.64 --> 01:24:15.52
I'd never been shot before so I had no idea how it felt in this strange slow motion scene

1544
01:24:15.52 --> 01:24:20.32
I had a mental conversation with myself hey am I actually getting shot right now?

1545
01:24:20.88 --> 01:24:26.40
It occurred to me that those sledjammers smashing all of my body will bullets hitting me one after another

1546
01:24:27.36 --> 01:24:32.40
It was in this moment that I said my first real prayer God please get me home to my girls

1547
01:24:32.96 --> 01:24:36.56
My wife and two young daughters were halfway around the world in that instant

1548
01:24:37.12 --> 01:24:39.12
I felt them and they felt me

1549
01:24:40.56 --> 01:24:44.88
I felt like a bullet dodging character in the movie the matrix only it wasn't dodging any of the bullets

1550
01:24:44.88 --> 01:24:48.08
They were hitting me my rifle shot out of my hands

1551
01:24:48.80 --> 01:24:54.96
bullets whizzing past my head hammered into the men entering the room behind me even as I continued to penetrate down the left wall

1552
01:24:54.96 --> 01:25:02.24
Nobody else in my train would be able to make entry as all four of the enemy continued to fire directly into what is known as the fatal funnel

1553
01:25:04.08 --> 01:25:07.76
The dimly lit doorway in which I was standing

1554
01:25:07.76 --> 01:25:15.36
The enemy bullets triggered my rage and drove me to act it was then that my body became

1555
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:23.44
Became my mind and took over I suppose that's what habit is when somebody when the body over rides the mind and acts without specific

1556
01:25:23.44 --> 01:25:28.88
Instructions from the brain my right hand instinctively reached down from my secondary weapon epistol

1557
01:25:28.88 --> 01:25:34.96
My hand was on autopilot as unhooked the rubber strap I'd fastening to keep my pistol secure and with a fluid push

1558
01:25:34.96 --> 01:25:42.000
Food forward push and pull very same motion. I had done a hundred thousand times in training my weapon release from my holster

1559
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.44
I aim my pistol engaged the enemy fighter directly opposite me down the left wall. He was glaring at me with his weapon throwing rounds directly at me

1560
01:25:49.44 --> 01:25:54.16
I returned fire four or five rounds from my weapon in caught him in the face and chest as he stared at me

1561
01:25:54.16 --> 01:26:02.000
His head jilted back. I saw the life leave his eyes like a light going off. I knew he was dead as he melted into a pile in front of me

1562
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.24
I landed next to the dead man on my left years of training and muscle memory without any direct orders from my brain

1563
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:12.24
Lifted my arm arched it and aim my pistol at a young male figure

1564
01:26:12.48 --> 01:26:20.72
Maybe in his early 20s as he stood up and moved toward the doorway. I was still on the floor when I watched him pull a hand grenade from the front of his vest and pulled a pin

1565
01:26:21.68 --> 01:26:29.36
My right hand pointed at him my index finger squeeze the trigger. I saw the bullets exit my pistol and spin clockwise as they flew toward him

1566
01:26:29.36 --> 01:26:36.48
Leaving a green vapor trail in their wake. I watched my bullets punch into one side of his head and exhaust a blood and brain

1567
01:26:36.48 --> 01:26:38.56
Matter instantly exiting out the other side

1568
01:26:38.56 --> 01:26:44.88
I shot him dead as he attempted to sue his side mission to run out in the four-year with a live grenade where my fellow seals and Iraqi

1569
01:26:44.88 --> 01:26:47.36
Scouts had stacked up attempting to enter the room

1570
01:26:47.36 --> 01:26:58.80
My rounds drop them in his tracks as he fell forward. I saw the grenade release from his hand and rolled toward me then it detonated

1571
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:10.88
This is crazy one of our newly arrived seals from team 10 so these are the guys that just showed up this probably this kid's first op

1572
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:14.40
Yeah, but he was he was to pull to him. Oh, okay, so he was good to go

1573
01:27:14.40 --> 01:27:16.40
One of the newly arrived

1574
01:27:16.40 --> 01:27:19.40
First night the still in the first night

1575
01:27:20.88 --> 01:27:27.84
One of the newly arrived seals from team 10 was outside under the carport looking into the rooms only window when he saw my bullets enter the enemies head

1576
01:27:27.84 --> 01:27:33.76
He watched as the enemy fell the ensuing grenade blast shattered the window sprang shards of glass into my teammates face

1577
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.84
This was his first mission on Iraq a new way to stop great-day and wait and start a new job

1578
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:44.16
Grenade blast knocked me unconscious when I woke a few minutes later

1579
01:27:44.16 --> 01:27:51.76
I was fully lucid and lying on my left side looking across the room at two men both were firing their weapons over my head out the window directly above me

1580
01:27:52.76 --> 01:27:57.36
The grenade blast had twisted my helmet rendering my night vision goggles unusable

1581
01:27:58.12 --> 01:28:05.04
The light from their muzzle flashes and the dim glow of the gas lamp and the foyer were enough to clearly illuminate the men standing no more than 10 feet away from me

1582
01:28:05.04 --> 01:28:10.40
I heard no sounds it was totally silent. I was in a very bad place in the middle of a gun flight

1583
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:18.92
If the enemy caught a glimpse of me glaring up at them all it would take for them to finish me off with both of them to point down pull their triggers and unload high velocity bullets into me

1584
01:28:20.08 --> 01:28:23.64
If I could clearly see them then they could see me too for an instant

1585
01:28:23.64 --> 01:28:29.000
I thought about playing dead, but in that same millisecond before the thought could be fully evaluated

1586
01:28:29.32 --> 01:28:31.32
My anger rejected it outright

1587
01:28:31.32 --> 01:28:36.12
I'd never been so angry a feeling of determined ruthless rage

1588
01:28:36.36 --> 01:28:44.32
It seemed to be stored up somewhere deep inside me and something just snapped in that moment my rage consumed me my world closed in and nothing else

1589
01:28:44.32 --> 01:28:51.12
Matter to me, but destroying the two men standing still in front of me. I would fight back and kill them before they killed me

1590
01:28:51.12 --> 01:29:03.000
Other crazy thing about this is there were some holes in me that don't line up like I could two holes in my back

1591
01:29:05.60 --> 01:29:09.36
You think they shot you in your unconscious. That's the only thing I can come up with

1592
01:29:10.56 --> 01:29:16.000
I had two rounds in my back that's shattered my right scapula and there's no holes in the body armor

1593
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.96
So I think they took the pistol and shoved it in there and then they shot me twice in the butt

1594
01:29:21.60 --> 01:29:27.40
On the way I got shot in the butt. It's someone stood over top of me. I don't know why they didn't put one in my head

1595
01:29:27.72 --> 01:29:29.72
Should have looked at the helmet more

1596
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:35.000
Maybe they tried to shoot me to head and the helmet just got in the way but

1597
01:29:36.76 --> 01:29:38.76
This this round right here

1598
01:29:38.76 --> 01:29:45.78
Four months after the incident this is around your wearing round your hatched. It's a non-milled round

1599
01:29:45.78 --> 01:29:50.92
And I got shot in a butt with and I didn't know about it that it was still in me until I went to a

1600
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:54.96
Procedure to get a stint pulled out of my bladder four or four and a half months later and

1601
01:29:55.76 --> 01:29:59.78
They took an X ray of it and came back in X ray of tech was like hey, you know, there's a bullet in your head

1602
01:30:00.04 --> 01:30:02.04
That's how I found this bullet

1603
01:30:02.56 --> 01:30:06.28
But the way the hip is you know that that arch right there

1604
01:30:06.28 --> 01:30:10.08
So it was right there and it

1605
01:30:11.92 --> 01:30:16.72
From 2007 to like two years ago is in a chiropractor and he took some X-rays and it had moved

1606
01:30:16.72 --> 01:30:22.60
Then he took a side profile and it was literally at the service of my stomach and then we had that some headaches cut it out

1607
01:30:23.68 --> 01:30:26.04
We thought it was gonna take like five minutes. I'll show you the pictures

1608
01:30:26.04 --> 01:30:36.68
God video of them cutting out in the back of the suburban. Oh, there you go proper dinner break proper surgery

1609
01:30:38.28 --> 01:30:43.32
Going back to this I didn't know it at the time, but I was lying unconscious on the floor while I was lying on

1610
01:30:43.32 --> 01:30:50.000
Conscious on the floor my CLT made to where outside the door of the room trying to get a shot at the enemy two of our Iraqi counterparts

1611
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.20
Where the only eyes that saw me enter the room in the chaos that ensued they were unable to communicate my location to anyone

1612
01:30:56.56 --> 01:31:01.64
The volume of fire coming from the room through the door and out of the window is so excessive that there was no way

1613
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:06.80
Anyone else was getting into the room the team decided to pull everyone back and call an air strike to neutralize the target

1614
01:31:08.08 --> 01:31:10.08
And me with it

1615
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:18.28
As the team pulled back from the house Connor my other CLT made with shot and wounded by one of the two remaining enemy fighters firing over my head and out the window

1616
01:31:18.28 --> 01:31:23.84
While I lay on the floor my teammates worked their radio is calling for the status of each other and what was going on in the house

1617
01:31:23.84 --> 01:31:25.84
I heard nothing

1618
01:31:27.36 --> 01:31:32.88
As the remaining elements of my assault team departed the house and moved to a safe dropping distance from the target

1619
01:31:32.88 --> 01:31:39.04
I was lying on my left side with my pistol still in my right hand just like before my arm reached up and aimed at one of the men

1620
01:31:39.32 --> 01:31:43.36
Standing in front of me and my finger pulled the trigger. I couldn't hear the gun fire

1621
01:31:43.36 --> 01:31:50.16
But I felt my hand jump rounds exit my weapon and I watched the projectiles find slow motion as they punched into his body

1622
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:57.16
The small holes burst open in the fabric of his shirt where my bullets entered his face contorted into a bizarre

1623
01:31:57.44 --> 01:32:00.24
Combination of surprise and pain more surprised than pain

1624
01:32:00.80 --> 01:32:06.84
Then less than five seconds. I ran a magazine dry completed a magazine change before the two enemy fighters figured out

1625
01:32:06.84 --> 01:32:09.48
I was still alive and I was shooting back at them

1626
01:32:09.48 --> 01:32:17.08
My bullets drew their gun fire away from my departing teammates their full attention and bullets were then directed back at me

1627
01:32:25.40 --> 01:32:28.08
The enemy fighters were now both so close to me

1628
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:32.72
I remember the stunned look on their faces as they pointed their weapons back at me and fired

1629
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:39.80
Around from one of their AK-47 struck the bottom of my pistol and dislodged my guns magazine my pistol jammed

1630
01:32:39.80 --> 01:32:46.64
And I felt the guns grip crumbled in my hand another enemy bullet sailed clear through the foot of my magazine

1631
01:32:46.64 --> 01:32:47.28
I

1632
01:32:47.28 --> 01:32:54.72
Open my hands slightly to release the shards of broken plastic that were once my pistol grips the grip seemed to absorb the shock

1633
01:32:54.72 --> 01:32:56.12
Shattering like an armor plate

1634
01:32:56.12 --> 01:33:02.20
I was fortunate to have this type of weapon any other model would have been smashed to bits or been shot out of my hands my

1635
01:33:03.40 --> 01:33:06.44
Palmas now pressed against the guns internal springs

1636
01:33:08.60 --> 01:33:13.16
The bullets that struck my pistol caused my weapon a malfunction. I squeezed the trigger but nothing happened

1637
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:19.78
I quickly cleared the malfunction with the tap of a on the bottom of the magazine to firmly reinsert into the pistol

1638
01:33:19.78 --> 01:33:25.42
A rack of the slide then squeezed the trigger. I had done this top rack bay malfunction drill so many times

1639
01:33:25.42 --> 01:33:31.52
It had happened automatically all the while I was still being shot at from no more than 10 feet away

1640
01:33:32.14 --> 01:33:38.58
An instant later well before the human brain could process what and how it had happened my hand aimed at the pistol at the other

1641
01:33:38.58 --> 01:33:43.74
Man standing across for me my finger squeezed the trigger. I saw the rounds twisting as they

1642
01:33:43.90 --> 01:33:48.62
Exited my pistol flying toward him and entering his body then around tunneled into his face

1643
01:33:48.62 --> 01:33:55.58
I empty the magazine to both men as they crumbled in the floor in front of me

1644
01:33:55.58 --> 01:34:02.68
I loaded my last magazine into my damaged pistol. I was lying on my left side leaning against the man who I had first shot when I entered the room

1645
01:34:02.68 --> 01:34:10.60
I pushed myself up with one hand and reached behind with the other placing my pistol against my dead enemies motionless body and fired several more rounds

1646
01:34:10.60 --> 01:34:19.20
Seconds later all four enemy fighters were silent. Their dead bodies lay in pools of their own blood and piles of spent bullet gazings

1647
01:34:19.20 --> 01:34:24.34
A metallic odor filled flooded the room blood and urine leak from their bodies onto the floor

1648
01:34:24.34 --> 01:34:25.88
I

1649
01:34:25.88 --> 01:34:31.32
New I had been shot. I felt heavy like there was a few hundred pounds sitting on my back

1650
01:34:32.20 --> 01:34:34.20
It was difficult to breathe

1651
01:34:34.20 --> 01:34:40.52
The fight was not over and the worst battles were yet to come

1652
01:34:49.28 --> 01:34:57.74
Crazy gunfight my left thumb was a much shot off to get I had around go through this this joint right here

1653
01:34:57.74 --> 01:35:05.20
When I I didn't figure it out until later after I got up and walked around tried to take my gloves off

1654
01:35:06.20 --> 01:35:13.08
But I put that pistol in this left hand and reached out and shot so we've like this my thumb is like

1655
01:35:13.08 --> 01:35:16.12
Almost hanging off the only thing was holding on was my glove

1656
01:35:21.26 --> 01:35:24.30
I mean look how lucky. I don't know. Yeah, just won't bend

1657
01:35:24.30 --> 01:35:26.30
Crazy

1658
01:35:28.30 --> 01:35:34.78
Yeah, the the weapon functioning. I mean you still have the magazine I did go back

1659
01:35:35.90 --> 01:35:38.46
After about five months and I was like hey, I want that pistol

1660
01:35:38.46 --> 01:35:41.18
You know we already cleaned it up and put it back in circulation

1661
01:35:41.86 --> 01:35:46.66
So somebody else was using it. I was like I want that pistol. Did you ever get it? No

1662
01:35:48.34 --> 01:35:51.34
Yeah, the I was thinking about this you know

1663
01:35:51.34 --> 01:35:57.26
We started off when I started off. I'll talk about how you know you can get shot one person get shot one person

1664
01:35:57.26 --> 01:36:00.30
Catch a little tiny piece of frag like the size of a freaking

1665
01:36:01.38 --> 01:36:06.76
The size of a little pebble yeah and kill them. Yeah, you popped up for more lottery or you

1666
01:36:07.42 --> 01:36:10.38
Pop-guarder up here. That's what happened Clark we had one around

1667
01:36:11.98 --> 01:36:13.98
Basically just go right through his neck right here. I

1668
01:36:15.02 --> 01:36:17.02
Was just hit that already

1669
01:36:17.02 --> 01:36:21.18
It was quick when I found him you stopped a smile on his face

1670
01:36:22.14 --> 01:36:24.14
Sitting up right position

1671
01:36:24.14 --> 01:36:26.14
And he was 27 years old at

1672
01:36:27.50 --> 01:36:29.50
Got a shirt on

1673
01:36:31.98 --> 01:36:33.98
Okay, it was his second deployment

1674
01:36:37.66 --> 01:36:39.66
Yeah

1675
01:36:39.66 --> 01:36:41.66
I

1676
01:36:42.86 --> 01:36:49.58
Need to secure the building myself so I moved to the foyer with its glowing lamp and then to the room directly beside where my gunfight had happened

1677
01:36:50.38 --> 01:36:53.82
There were six women and children all sitting in the far corner screaming and crying

1678
01:36:53.82 --> 01:36:57.02
I pointed my white light at them and yelled shut up

1679
01:36:58.46 --> 01:37:01.18
None of them spoke English, but they all became silent

1680
01:37:03.82 --> 01:37:05.82
That's also the room where I found Clarky

1681
01:37:05.82 --> 01:37:15.42
He was just inside the doorway sitting down with both legs spread out in front of him resting upright and leaning back slightly on his rucksack

1682
01:37:19.02 --> 01:37:23.42
Clarky's trademark smirk was frozen on his face with his lips curled in a smile

1683
01:37:25.10 --> 01:37:29.66
He looks so peaceful he'd been killed instantly by around that he'd come out of my room

1684
01:37:29.66 --> 01:37:34.86
I tried to move him from the view of the front door, but he was too heavy

1685
01:37:38.30 --> 01:37:40.94
Clark shredder was 27 years old

1686
01:37:42.06 --> 01:37:49.58
He would take over a decade for the magnitude of Clark's death the penetrate me my tears now are often spontaneous triggered by a fleeting memory

1687
01:37:49.90 --> 01:37:52.78
A mixture of accumulated losses or just a random thought

1688
01:37:52.78 --> 01:37:58.06
At that moment though, I couldn't stop and grieve over Clarky

1689
01:37:58.06 --> 01:38:00.86
I needed to secure the building and protect my teammates

1690
01:38:04.30 --> 01:38:10.38
In another room in the back of the compound I found two enemy detainees are Iraqi scouts have made entry into this room

1691
01:38:10.38 --> 01:38:15.82
Discovered the men and cough them. I checked their flecks coughs and put one of our Iraqi scouts in place to guard them

1692
01:38:15.82 --> 01:38:23.98
I positioned our other Iraqi scouts at the front entry with specific orders to shoot anyone who tried to come into the house. I knew that I was shot up

1693
01:38:23.98 --> 01:38:30.78
I walked around and cleared the house with my damaged pistol each time I turned my head I could feel my radio earpiece snag on my body armor

1694
01:38:31.98 --> 01:38:37.02
I plugged my earbud in and keyed the radio to ask for a status in the house, but no, but my radio had been shot

1695
01:38:37.50 --> 01:38:43.90
It's still at a tone, but no signal my radio is smashed. I needed to contact the team. I tried to swap out my radio with Clarky's

1696
01:38:43.90 --> 01:38:50.94
But my gloves were slippery from all the blood. I just started to pull off my left hand glove when I saw that my thumb was barely attached to my hand

1697
01:38:50.94 --> 01:38:52.94
It flopped into my palm

1698
01:38:52.94 --> 01:38:57.42
There was a bullet hole through the glove. I must have been shot the thumb when the enemy shot at my pistol

1699
01:38:57.42 --> 01:38:59.42
Discourrent destroying my gun's grips

1700
01:38:59.98 --> 01:39:04.30
I decided to leave my gloves on eventually I managed to switch out my radio for Clarky's

1701
01:39:04.30 --> 01:39:09.82
I moved back into the room where my gunfight had happened. I felt safer there as I knew everyone and it was dead

1702
01:39:09.82 --> 01:39:15.98
It was there that I made radio contact with the rest of the team. Hey, this is Mike

1703
01:39:16.54 --> 01:39:19.02
I'm still in the house. It's secure

1704
01:39:19.74 --> 01:39:23.82
We've got four enemy killed an action one-eye racky scout killed an action

1705
01:39:25.18 --> 01:39:27.18
one-seal killed an action

1706
01:39:28.38 --> 01:39:30.38
two detainees

1707
01:39:30.38 --> 01:39:38.30
six women and children

1708
01:39:41.42 --> 01:39:42.94
Man

1709
01:39:43.34 --> 01:39:44.54
They call the cure after that night

1710
01:39:45.74 --> 01:39:49.18
Took them hour and 15 minutes to go like five miles

1711
01:39:51.74 --> 01:39:55.34
Five miles. When did they activate the cure after when they probably when they started back and out of the house?

1712
01:39:55.34 --> 01:40:00.62
Uh, we always initiate the cure after soon as gunfight

1713
01:40:01.18 --> 01:40:04.70
Started as soon as there was a tech we would initiate cure after

1714
01:40:06.14 --> 01:40:08.54
So they would get ready and then we could launch them

1715
01:40:09.90 --> 01:40:12.46
But I mean that that area was so

1716
01:40:13.26 --> 01:40:16.70
We went after this target one other time we got ID it on the way in yeah and

1717
01:40:17.58 --> 01:40:20.30
Those are some of the cool details that you put in the book which

1718
01:40:20.30 --> 01:40:25.34
Like I said that's why people have to buy the book if they want to want to get the rest of it because the background behind it

1719
01:40:25.34 --> 01:40:30.06
You know you explained the efforts that you guys had made to hit this target and it was a terrible area

1720
01:40:30.14 --> 01:40:35.74
Pretty much one way in when we out unless you wanted to do like an extra 75 kilometers to get and then

1721
01:40:36.38 --> 01:40:38.38
If you didn't get lost back there

1722
01:40:38.62 --> 01:40:40.62
Because I mean the map's weren't accurate

1723
01:40:42.46 --> 01:40:46.94
I mean your greatest threat over there wasn't getting until it gunfight it was going to and from now

1724
01:40:46.94 --> 01:40:49.66
It was your biggest threat we got ID and I think you're

1725
01:40:51.50 --> 01:40:53.50
Six times on that deployment and

1726
01:40:54.06 --> 01:40:57.98
You know when that when that happens over and over again they start looking who's here every time

1727
01:40:57.98 --> 01:41:02.38
And I was one of the guys, okay, Mike's from possible one of the two possible ID magnets

1728
01:41:03.26 --> 01:41:08.70
Because every time we get ID one of you two is there or both here there actually we were both there for all of them so

1729
01:41:10.38 --> 01:41:14.30
How big how many seals did you have with you how many seals were on this op?

1730
01:41:14.30 --> 01:41:18.94
I know real force we could take a little bit more if we had birds but

1731
01:41:20.30 --> 01:41:27.18
A normal force and a half of it had to be a rackies and we don't give them mods and radio so you have to make

1732
01:41:28.94 --> 01:41:31.18
Corrections for that like we have to drive the vehicles

1733
01:41:33.02 --> 01:41:36.62
So it'd be like 20 guys but that would include a turp

1734
01:41:37.34 --> 01:41:39.34
You know half a rocket force

1735
01:41:39.34 --> 01:41:45.34
Occasionally brought this marine had a dog that never found anything but a pistol holster

1736
01:41:48.46 --> 01:41:51.98
He did say that dog might have got baked in the car and it gets warm out there

1737
01:41:52.70 --> 01:41:59.42
Yeah, like 22 but we we go out with six on these. There's only four seats and well five and you got the gunner, but the way we work

1738
01:42:01.18 --> 01:42:02.86
Six people in a vehicle you're only getting

1739
01:42:02.86 --> 01:42:08.54
Four people that are actually gonna work maybe three inside yeah, so I

1740
01:42:09.82 --> 01:42:11.82
Have worked with other units where they leave

1741
01:42:12.54 --> 01:42:15.42
Everybody gets out of the vehicle on the way the counter stays. I think like

1742
01:42:18.30 --> 01:42:20.30
Say he does that

1743
01:42:20.94 --> 01:42:22.94
We don't like that plan the

1744
01:42:23.90 --> 01:42:30.54
Man for you to like just go back into full on team guy mode of okay here's what's going on

1745
01:42:30.54 --> 01:42:39.10
I'm shot up. I got to finish clearing this house by myself get the house cleared doing assessment set security and then

1746
01:42:39.98 --> 01:42:43.42
Contact the team and say hey, it's Mike

1747
01:42:44.46 --> 01:42:46.46
Target secure

1748
01:42:49.90 --> 01:42:51.90
Damn

1749
01:42:51.90 --> 01:42:53.90
I don't believe it

1750
01:42:53.90 --> 01:42:59.74
Freaking legit, man. I was definitely in shock. I did miss a room. I missed the stairs upstairs

1751
01:42:59.74 --> 01:43:04.70
To the prayer room upstairs so they had to clear that I missed it

1752
01:43:06.70 --> 01:43:08.94
But I decomplected the front door they came in they were

1753
01:43:09.50 --> 01:43:15.58
Reclear the house because I pulled the guy off the front door that I told she'd anybody that came through because they were taken fire from me outside

1754
01:43:16.30 --> 01:43:18.62
You know when when the neighbors know that you're there

1755
01:43:19.66 --> 01:43:21.66
Some people like to shoot at the window at you

1756
01:43:22.54 --> 01:43:25.10
Which was a lesson that we learned early on because

1757
01:43:25.90 --> 01:43:27.90
Who doesn't like the blow up a door

1758
01:43:27.90 --> 01:43:33.50
With sometimes you don't have to blow it up sometimes just turn it door knob sometimes that door knob works

1759
01:43:34.30 --> 01:43:37.18
And when you blow up a door that the whole neighborhood knows you're there

1760
01:43:38.30 --> 01:43:40.30
People take pop shots at you

1761
01:43:42.54 --> 01:43:44.54
Freaking awesome, man

1762
01:43:44.54 --> 01:43:46.54
Awesome work

1763
01:43:47.58 --> 01:43:51.18
I also got a K round this before I got the idea for this necklace

1764
01:43:51.18 --> 01:43:57.82
The guys found when they took my body armor and they came around fell out of it and it's slightly flat on one side

1765
01:43:59.18 --> 01:44:03.34
And it's got rifling on it so that's how you know that it actually came through a rifle barrel

1766
01:44:05.26 --> 01:44:07.26
But that one hit me inside a ten feet and

1767
01:44:08.30 --> 01:44:13.50
It's completely intact. I mean it's like barely flat on one side. I can't explain that one either

1768
01:44:14.78 --> 01:44:17.26
But I did get shot in the right places like

1769
01:44:17.26 --> 01:44:26.78
I know guys it got shot in a femur. You hit bone it changes everything and I only had two bones hit my left thumb and my right scapula

1770
01:44:29.10 --> 01:44:31.74
I did have a round go up in inside of my right thigh

1771
01:44:32.70 --> 01:44:36.86
Which is probably the one the doctors are the most amazed about because if you know about

1772
01:44:37.90 --> 01:44:42.38
The kinetic energy it's not energy that's being pushed in front of a bullet. It's what's being pulled

1773
01:44:42.38 --> 01:44:48.38
And all the cavitation and how it ruptures organs and ruptures blood vessels and arteries

1774
01:44:48.94 --> 01:44:50.94
That should have popped my femur artery

1775
01:44:51.98 --> 01:44:56.62
Because that ran from my knee right above my knee all the way up to my inner thigh

1776
01:44:57.90 --> 01:44:59.90
And that was definitely an AK round because

1777
01:45:01.18 --> 01:45:03.18
The whole my leg

1778
01:45:03.18 --> 01:45:05.90
It looked like someone took a cookie cutter of an AK round and

1779
01:45:07.18 --> 01:45:11.34
Cut it out and the gunshot wounds healed weird

1780
01:45:11.34 --> 01:45:15.82
They started off small and then they got bigger as a healed and then they shrunk

1781
01:45:17.18 --> 01:45:19.18
I didn't have any bad exit wounds

1782
01:45:20.54 --> 01:45:22.54
Everything went through me

1783
01:45:22.94 --> 01:45:25.58
I got a bad exit wound out of my right arm pit that blew out

1784
01:45:28.70 --> 01:45:32.86
But it's kind of actually hard you know I'm claiming 27 and it's the best of the technology

1785
01:45:33.74 --> 01:45:37.58
But you know the one that went through my left thigh might have been the same one that went through my scrote

1786
01:45:37.58 --> 01:45:39.58
I don't know

1787
01:45:39.58 --> 01:45:43.10
But I'm not gonna ruin a good story. Hey bro. I say we're round up

1788
01:45:44.86 --> 01:45:46.86
And honestly those ones I hit the body armor

1789
01:45:48.62 --> 01:45:50.62
I was more aware the ones at the body armor

1790
01:45:51.34 --> 01:45:56.06
I had no idea where I was I been shot until I pulled my glove off. I knew I've been shot in the chest and back

1791
01:45:56.62 --> 01:46:00.14
I could feel it. I mean I had I had a bunch of broken ribs

1792
01:46:01.34 --> 01:46:02.62
Um

1793
01:46:02.62 --> 01:46:06.94
And I had a contention on my right long so when I when I called those guys I was like you guys get a hurry up

1794
01:46:06.94 --> 01:46:11.90
I can't breathe. I think I got a sucking chest wound. You know they pulled my body armor off and there's two holes in my back

1795
01:46:13.26 --> 01:46:16.30
And they tried to get a bit of a reclusive dressing on it

1796
01:46:17.34 --> 01:46:19.58
an old one that we used to use and they couldn't get it to stick

1797
01:46:20.54 --> 01:46:22.14
so

1798
01:46:22.14 --> 01:46:24.14
Luckily it wasn't a sucking chest wound

1799
01:46:27.02 --> 01:46:30.70
Yeah, and you got shot with green tip too, right? Yeah, and

1800
01:46:31.90 --> 01:46:33.58
They took my body armor

1801
01:46:33.58 --> 01:46:37.90
After that whatever company does the investigation and they took it apart layer by layer

1802
01:46:38.54 --> 01:46:43.90
So the other layer body armor spawning it's that black stuff it kind of looks I don't know how to just

1803
01:46:44.54 --> 01:46:47.82
It's to stuff the holes everything together so it's a ceramic plate there's multiple layers

1804
01:46:49.18 --> 01:46:54.38
And plus I had to carry her on and at that time we were doing the soft armor hard armor before alpha with a soft

1805
01:46:56.38 --> 01:46:58.38
I can't imagine

1806
01:46:58.86 --> 01:47:00.86
Getting shot in the chest

1807
01:47:00.86 --> 01:47:05.66
With standalone for alpha armor piercing protection without that soft armor

1808
01:47:06.06 --> 01:47:07.82
It's gonna break everyone in your damn ribs

1809
01:47:08.70 --> 01:47:12.38
Every damn one I only had I think four broken ribs

1810
01:47:13.90 --> 01:47:15.90
I mean you

1811
01:47:15.90 --> 01:47:22.30
These just so you pop a rib out of you once a lot of sucks it's freaking horrible man you get that that top of your breath and you can't

1812
01:47:23.18 --> 01:47:27.10
Someone stab at me. No, you don't want anyone to make you laugh or cough or anything like that

1813
01:47:27.10 --> 01:47:31.26
But yeah, the weird thing about green tip is that if you don't know anything about it

1814
01:47:31.26 --> 01:47:36.22
I'm trying to trade it more through the body armor than they caked it. Oh, I totally believe that

1815
01:47:36.22 --> 01:47:38.22
It's a green tip is American and

1816
01:47:39.02 --> 01:47:43.90
And five five six five five six what kind of the standard round for America?

1817
01:47:43.90 --> 01:47:47.90
We got a bunch of other ones. I know but green tip is kind of the standard

1818
01:47:48.46 --> 01:47:53.58
Round for let's say an army infantry unit and so you might wonder

1819
01:47:53.58 --> 01:48:02.94
How does Mike end up with green tip and his body or his body armor and the answer is they recover the weapon and yeah, there was this

1820
01:48:04.06 --> 01:48:06.06
All this guy's equipment to include his name

1821
01:48:07.26 --> 01:48:13.58
his LBE is a little bearing equipment with his magazines and it still had his name on it that his night vision goggles

1822
01:48:14.30 --> 01:48:16.30
That is pistol

1823
01:48:16.70 --> 01:48:19.74
That a bunch of these guys stuff and it was from what we figured out

1824
01:48:19.74 --> 01:48:22.78
Ambushed out in the body

1825
01:48:23.74 --> 01:48:26.94
Army unit in the body so an army unit in the body got ambushed

1826
01:48:27.42 --> 01:48:32.54
They captured this guy's equipment and then they put it to use and they put it to use on you man and the green tip

1827
01:48:33.82 --> 01:48:37.26
Was the only one that penetrated through the plate and

1828
01:48:38.14 --> 01:48:42.86
Made entry into the soft armor it got about halfway through all the plies on the soft armor

1829
01:48:42.86 --> 01:48:49.74
You mentioned the green tip like that it's standard but what special about green tip is the

1830
01:48:49.74 --> 01:48:51.74
What's it's five six?

1831
01:48:51.74 --> 01:48:56.06
It's the standard ammunition that we use it's we had a lot of problems with it in

1832
01:48:57.42 --> 01:48:58.78
different

1833
01:48:58.78 --> 01:49:00.78
different places like Somalia

1834
01:49:02.78 --> 01:49:07.90
What a terrible place to there is you women and children in shields, but the green tip was such a hot round

1835
01:49:07.90 --> 01:49:13.82
Meaning hot, it's the move so fast that sometimes it just goes right through people and it doesn't

1836
01:49:14.54 --> 01:49:17.82
Doesn't get the a lot of damage from bullet happens

1837
01:49:18.30 --> 01:49:22.70
After it passes through and it's the cavitation and the cavity it creates behind it

1838
01:49:23.34 --> 01:49:25.34
It's really not what it does in front of it

1839
01:49:28.62 --> 01:49:32.62
But the green tip so fast it doesn't create that cavitation it just cuts through stuff

1840
01:49:32.62 --> 01:49:37.90
But it's also it's a repair thing, right? Yeah, it's it's fast and it's small

1841
01:49:38.70 --> 01:49:45.58
So if it's and it's made it is yeah, it punches through armor a lot as you know this it's not it's not supposed to punch through for a

1842
01:49:45.66 --> 01:49:52.14
Yeah, well, who knows when I got hit with the green tip because I had three rounds in the chest and if you look at the body armor

1843
01:49:52.14 --> 01:49:54.14
It's already

1844
01:49:54.14 --> 01:49:56.14
It aggregates with each one

1845
01:49:56.14 --> 01:49:59.58
They they they're only going to say yeah, this will save you from one round

1846
01:49:59.58 --> 01:50:02.54
Yeah, that's what they'll tell you after that we don't know what that what's gonna do

1847
01:50:03.58 --> 01:50:07.50
Because if it I mean if you get if you take one and the tenering

1848
01:50:07.74 --> 01:50:11.82
Yeah, and that damage is everything. Oh, maybe that does more damage

1849
01:50:12.22 --> 01:50:15.74
equally all the way around but I got hit like here here and here

1850
01:50:16.94 --> 01:50:17.98
Uh

1851
01:50:18.30 --> 01:50:22.30
And maybe the green tip wasn't the first one well, maybe it was the first one

1852
01:50:22.94 --> 01:50:26.06
Before the AK hit it before it was so aggregated that it was useless

1853
01:50:26.06 --> 01:50:29.90
I don't know what's in front of my face and like she died mill into it all day

1854
01:50:30.78 --> 01:50:32.78
Doesn't make it net and doesn't make it dead

1855
01:50:33.50 --> 01:50:39.98
You can barely find the dent from a nine mill and that stuff. Yeah, I mean this was just a lot weaker than rifles are and then

1856
01:50:40.38 --> 01:50:43.42
Yeah, have that argument to what round or shot placement

1857
01:50:43.82 --> 01:50:46.70
Well, I'm shot placement you're all shot placement

1858
01:50:46.70 --> 01:50:49.74
Yeah, and if you're not good at shot placement then just put a lot there

1859
01:50:51.02 --> 01:50:53.02
You know can't tie knots tie a lot

1860
01:50:53.02 --> 01:50:55.58
Yeah, what a doubt overload

1861
01:50:57.02 --> 01:50:58.02
Uh

1862
01:50:58.02 --> 01:51:03.18
Going back to the book 15 minute minutes after I'd called the team to let them know I'd been shot the MetaVac landed

1863
01:51:03.98 --> 01:51:05.66
I had to say that because that's freaking awesome

1864
01:51:06.14 --> 01:51:11.58
Jack asked if I need any help as we walk together to the bird about 150 yards and all I felt heavy and slow as we walked together

1865
01:51:11.58 --> 01:51:15.58
Over the freshly plowed field I put my left arm over his shoulder to steady myself as I moved

1866
01:51:15.90 --> 01:51:18.22
Jack instinctively reached up and grab my hand

1867
01:51:18.46 --> 01:51:21.50
Which almost ripped off my dangling thumb jack like oh my thumb

1868
01:51:21.50 --> 01:51:28.54
Conner my seal teammate who was wounded in the arm exiting the house jumped on the bird for the short flight to the hospital and Baghdad

1869
01:51:28.86 --> 01:51:32.86
He was another one of our team's medics and I thought he that's why he was with me

1870
01:51:33.18 --> 01:51:38.50
I didn't know that he had been shot until we were in the hospital together and Bethesda Maryland. That was me

1871
01:51:38.50 --> 01:51:40.50
Yeah, it was first deployed

1872
01:51:42.38 --> 01:51:46.86
The flight medic was very efficient crawling all over me to cut off my clothes and gear to get to my wounds and

1873
01:51:46.86 --> 01:51:52.62
Serting his knee into every bullet hole in the process and his defense. There wasn't much he could touch that didn't have a bullet hole

1874
01:51:53.26 --> 01:51:55.26
Punched out of it

1875
01:51:56.14 --> 01:52:00.54
My seal teammate Chris Till had been assigned as my casualty assistant's officer and

1876
01:52:00.94 --> 01:52:06.22
Would accompany me all the way back home Chris was standing next to me with a satellite phone

1877
01:52:06.22 --> 01:52:13.10
You have to call your wife he said I refused it first, but then I remembered that my next of kin must be notified within 24 hours of an incident

1878
01:52:13.10 --> 01:52:17.34
Brande was back in Virginia Beach shopping with the girls when chansored

1879
01:52:18.78 --> 01:52:24.46
Hey, I said I don't have a lot of time. I'm coming home early. I got shot, but I'm fine

1880
01:52:24.46 --> 01:52:30.30
I've got all my limbs my face is fine and the doctor said I'm going to make a hundred percent recovery. I'll see you soon

1881
01:52:31.58 --> 01:52:35.82
I had to phone back to Chris and the medical team stacked me on the plane

1882
01:52:35.82 --> 01:52:41.66
I must have passed out because my next memory is waking up in the United States at Naval Medical Center

1883
01:52:41.66 --> 01:52:43.66
Bethesda, Maryland

1884
01:52:45.10 --> 01:52:48.30
Talk to good 50 people that talked to me in launch still

1885
01:52:51.02 --> 01:52:53.02
Don't remember don't remember

1886
01:52:53.90 --> 01:53:03.26
Yeah, I be one of those people is was was Admiral Craven. Yes, so that's cool and and you guys knew each other from team three

1887
01:53:03.66 --> 01:53:06.78
Yeah, I was in my first three commanding officers were

1888
01:53:06.78 --> 01:53:10.30
McTime, McNally and McRaven

1889
01:53:11.82 --> 01:53:13.82
Three three mix

1890
01:53:14.94 --> 01:53:21.26
Yeah, you do you do that and and you you talk about that visit from from the Admiral again

1891
01:53:21.82 --> 01:53:24.94
Well, that was from I think I did some play-dories

1892
01:53:25.58 --> 01:53:32.14
Pladurizing from his book. Yeah, you pull through he's got a book out called sea stories and it's one of the stories in his book is you know

1893
01:53:32.14 --> 01:53:38.78
Visiting a guy that just been shot 27 times so there yeah, but yeah, you put it in this book as well

1894
01:53:38.78 --> 01:53:43.42
He's a good dude. I mean yeah, some people might think he's got some sway political views right now, but

1895
01:53:44.70 --> 01:53:48.30
You know, I watched him take care of people and that's kind of how I judge people

1896
01:53:48.30 --> 01:53:52.46
Yeah, like if you care about people and you take care of him. Yeah, and you're not doing shit the

1897
01:53:53.02 --> 01:53:54.54
feed your own

1898
01:53:54.54 --> 01:53:56.54
ego your own agenda

1899
01:53:56.54 --> 01:53:58.54
I mean you gotta have your own agenda. I got mine now

1900
01:53:58.54 --> 01:54:02.78
I mean it's part of the reason why I sold the book. I want to go surfing all the time

1901
01:54:05.18 --> 01:54:07.18
That's all I want to do

1902
01:54:12.22 --> 01:54:14.62
Yeah, it's a it's a pretty interesting story. I

1903
01:54:16.06 --> 01:54:17.50
Guess

1904
01:54:17.50 --> 01:54:21.98
We have from your perspective blessed. I have this story and be able to talk about it. You know

1905
01:54:22.86 --> 01:54:27.18
It's a very few people be able to pick this up and not find something in it that

1906
01:54:27.18 --> 01:54:30.06
They're gonna be able to write to in their own life bro

1907
01:54:32.62 --> 01:54:37.90
You got shot 27 times you know, and you did that job. I mean it's freaking that's a least interesting thing in the

1908
01:54:37.90 --> 01:54:42.30
Yeah, but but just yeah, you put the whole story together and

1909
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:47.82
Yeah, man, it's powerful and like you said there's all kinds of stuff for everybody and and

1910
01:54:47.82 --> 01:54:54.14
And you all get into some of it, but a lot of it is is you trying to explain how you got through this stuff and you know

1911
01:54:54.14 --> 01:54:59.18
How you got through your childhood trauma and what that trauma turns into and I'm gonna get into some of it

1912
01:54:59.18 --> 01:55:06.06
But that's just a whole another reason but even if you're a hippie that doesn't want to read a single thing about war

1913
01:55:07.02 --> 01:55:10.14
Go okay skip those parts because you're still gonna get something out of the rest of it

1914
01:55:10.54 --> 01:55:16.38
Well my publisher we were working through this or like like does this say a navy seal book or a cell

1915
01:55:16.38 --> 01:55:18.86
Pop book and I was like leave it in big was I don't care what you call it

1916
01:55:18.86 --> 01:55:24.06
Care what you call it yeah, now now I'm doing pretty good in the

1917
01:55:26.06 --> 01:55:28.06
The PTSD section

1918
01:55:30.38 --> 01:55:36.46
Trail and after I'm traveling after you bring the pump in at your door. I have a PTSD

1919
01:55:36.46 --> 01:55:40.94
There's a PTSD as no years years your books are number one and

1920
01:55:42.62 --> 01:55:45.66
War biographies and okay your books do awesome

1921
01:55:45.66 --> 01:55:52.46
How do I in the PTSD section? No, not PTSD as well and the PTSD section vanner coke

1922
01:55:53.50 --> 01:55:57.34
Body keeps the score which is one. Okay, that's the book that you talk about yeah that's one of the

1923
01:55:57.90 --> 01:55:59.90
Everybody's to read that book

1924
01:56:02.14 --> 01:56:04.30
Couple things in there if you understand your trauma

1925
01:56:05.74 --> 01:56:09.10
Your childhood trauma then your behaviors are predictable

1926
01:56:10.22 --> 01:56:13.58
You know, so if you understand that you become the person

1927
01:56:13.58 --> 01:56:19.98
That you're taught to be inferred and inside of the first seven years and you know what your reaction's gonna be to it

1928
01:56:19.98 --> 01:56:23.74
Then it's predictable and then you can work on it. I might trigger is I don't like anybody

1929
01:56:23.74 --> 01:56:27.74
Poked me in the chest and when I got scared I don't care

1930
01:56:28.86 --> 01:56:30.86
Sometimes I might over

1931
01:56:30.86 --> 01:56:32.86
Push back

1932
01:56:32.86 --> 01:56:34.86
I don't like to be called names and

1933
01:56:35.90 --> 01:56:40.14
I got cursed out by a little 20-year-old kid and starbucks a couple weeks ago

1934
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:43.18
And I had to ask him I was like boy how old are you?

1935
01:56:44.22 --> 01:56:47.34
He's like I'm 22 and this kid's flipping me off because I won't put out a mask

1936
01:56:48.46 --> 01:56:51.18
And I was like you wouldn't be talking to me like this if we were outside

1937
01:56:52.86 --> 01:56:57.26
But you know, I think that's a problem a lot of people in this world right now. You know the keyboard

1938
01:56:58.94 --> 01:57:02.86
The keyboard bullies and they get behind the wheels of their car and I like a bunch of assholes

1939
01:57:02.86 --> 01:57:04.22
I you know a lot of people just

1940
01:57:04.22 --> 01:57:09.90
Don't know that if if you could get punched in the face for being as rude as you are you wouldn't do it

1941
01:57:12.30 --> 01:57:17.50
Yeah, we got a society. It's just so rude now. I'm that me every time you get in your car to them

1942
01:57:17.50 --> 01:57:19.50
That's car raised people cutting you off and

1943
01:57:21.50 --> 01:57:25.10
I mean, I've got I've kind of slowed down. I was that type of driver

1944
01:57:26.54 --> 01:57:29.34
Then I rushed to get everywhere even though I didn't have a schedule

1945
01:57:29.34 --> 01:57:31.34
You

1946
01:57:32.06 --> 01:57:37.10
You well, sir, you talk about like I said you talk about some of this trauma and whatnot

1947
01:57:39.42 --> 01:57:44.30
And here's like here's like here's a little sample of sort of how you start looking at this stuff

1948
01:57:44.30 --> 01:57:46.38
I would spend the next 18 months training guys

1949
01:57:46.38 --> 01:57:48.70
Shuffling papers in a administrative duty at my new command

1950
01:57:48.70 --> 01:57:51.98
So this is this is now your I think you're back at trade-it again, right?

1951
01:57:51.98 --> 01:57:58.30
Yeah, I went back to work inside of five months about four and a five months and I was in that course that we talked about earlier that

1952
01:57:58.30 --> 01:58:00.30
Communications course

1953
01:58:00.70 --> 01:58:06.62
My physical physical medical my physical therapy team became an important part of my recovery in life

1954
01:58:06.62 --> 01:58:11.58
My team was made up of doctors nurses physical therapist chiropractic inclinations who specialize in all type of care

1955
01:58:12.06 --> 01:58:16.78
Most importantly this group understood seal culture seals tend toward the extreme

1956
01:58:16.78 --> 01:58:19.90
We think if one repetition is good then 500 must be great

1957
01:58:20.54 --> 01:58:25.66
I was blinded by my own bias and it wasn't the first time or the last one day long into my recovery

1958
01:58:25.66 --> 01:58:32.06
I can find it to my nurse that I may have been experiencing symptoms related to PTSD post traumatic stress disorder

1959
01:58:32.06 --> 01:58:37.82
I had been sitting in my truck listening to a radio talk show when the when the expert being interviewed began

1960
01:58:37.82 --> 01:58:43.34
Describing the common symptoms of PTSD the voice spoken a calm matter of fact tone talking about the

1961
01:58:44.62 --> 01:58:49.66
Autonomic nervous system and how sleeplessness constant irrational fears

1962
01:58:49.66 --> 01:58:57.98
And hyper vigilance are often normal and predictable responses to trauma. I listened to a stranger's voice described me to me

1963
01:58:58.86 --> 01:59:06.46
And I was both relieved and confused when I told the nurse who is a friend and someone I trusted she smiled and chuckled good to hear Mike

1964
01:59:06.46 --> 01:59:09.50
We all thought that you actually enjoyed what happened to you in that room

1965
01:59:10.14 --> 01:59:12.14
She seemed to understand

1966
01:59:12.38 --> 01:59:14.38
That being profoundly

1967
01:59:14.38 --> 01:59:23.18
Effected by my experience of war was normal and not being altered was abnormal. This was the first time that I considered the concept of emotional

1968
01:59:23.58 --> 01:59:25.58
Invisible wounds and that I had them

1969
01:59:26.30 --> 01:59:31.26
I have come to understand that if the experience of war does not profoundly alter you in some way

1970
01:59:31.26 --> 01:59:35.74
Then you may actually have a problem when the doctor said that I had been perfectly wounded

1971
01:59:35.90 --> 01:59:41.74
It seemed like a metaphor for my life. I had been beat up just enough not to kill me and through the process

1972
01:59:41.74 --> 01:59:46.30
I earned the perfect scars of wisdom to survive my next thrashing

1973
01:59:46.86 --> 01:59:53.34
I still had no idea how the events of my childhood influenced my thoughts and behavior. I'd become very good at compartmentalization

1974
01:59:54.38 --> 02:00:01.58
My self-awareness grew as I uncovered layers of trauma. I later found that my childhood wounds had prepared me for a career in the seal teams

1975
02:00:01.66 --> 02:00:04.30
But they also became a most haunting ones

1976
02:00:05.18 --> 02:00:10.46
I romantly it took being shot 27 times to uncover my original wounds the ones

1977
02:00:10.46 --> 02:00:13.34
That I never considered or knew I had

1978
02:00:19.42 --> 02:00:22.38
Yeah, so you know you start looking at what's going on

1979
02:00:23.74 --> 02:00:26.46
And this is this is cool. It's got to read this bro

1980
02:00:27.10 --> 02:00:29.26
Because it's a one one page chapter

1981
02:00:29.50 --> 02:00:35.74
Called the enemy within I fully accepted all the hazards of my chosen occupation being wounded was no big deal to me

1982
02:00:35.74 --> 02:00:39.26
At no time during or after I was shot that I ever think I was going to die

1983
02:00:39.26 --> 02:00:44.30
I was provided the best medical care available and was sure that my physical wounds would eventually heal

1984
02:00:44.86 --> 02:00:48.78
The real battle began when I returned home the war and Iraq was straightforward

1985
02:00:49.34 --> 02:00:54.70
I was expertly trained and had the unconditional support of a community of like-minded highly motivated professionals

1986
02:00:55.18 --> 02:00:58.78
Professionals as a seal I'd been institutionalized in a sense

1987
02:00:59.26 --> 02:01:02.14
I knew the culture the people the rules and the objective

1988
02:01:03.34 --> 02:01:06.30
After leaving the military and returning home my life became a

1989
02:01:06.30 --> 02:01:12.70
Confusing frustrating and stressful mess. I was a prisoner who had been released from the institution into a strange new world

1990
02:01:13.02 --> 02:01:15.90
There was a distructful a distrustful cynic

1991
02:01:16.38 --> 02:01:21.82
Slowly working his way inside me his voice sounded like my own and each day he became more convincing

1992
02:01:22.14 --> 02:01:24.46
I was surrounded isolated and desperate

1993
02:01:25.10 --> 02:01:30.54
This enemy knew all my weaknesses he was relentless and he eventually overpowered me

1994
02:01:30.54 --> 02:01:37.26
This enemy was me

1995
02:01:40.14 --> 02:01:42.94
So a couple things I want to say on the BTSD I

1996
02:01:45.02 --> 02:01:47.50
At that point it really wasn't PTSD

1997
02:01:48.38 --> 02:01:53.42
At least clinical because I haven't had any dreams about it. I don't mind talking about it

1998
02:01:55.02 --> 02:01:57.02
It doesn't bother me

1999
02:01:57.02 --> 02:02:00.70
It bothered more the people around me more than bothered me. It was more of a hindrance

2000
02:02:01.50 --> 02:02:03.74
You know that that I had to live in a recliner for three months

2001
02:02:04.54 --> 02:02:07.82
That bothered my kids because they'd never seem to get hurt sick

2002
02:02:09.02 --> 02:02:11.02
Pretty much was my first injury

2003
02:02:11.34 --> 02:02:13.66
Ever other than broken fingers and toes

2004
02:02:14.22 --> 02:02:19.26
I did pinch up from moral nerve that put me down for about two three months at one point. I don't have a PT thing

2005
02:02:20.94 --> 02:02:24.38
But I was really milding my first injury because the fingers and toes don't count

2006
02:02:24.38 --> 02:02:26.38
I don't count

2007
02:02:29.26 --> 02:02:32.86
But what had happened to me at this point

2008
02:02:33.50 --> 02:02:40.22
Well, I want to talk about what I call false anxiety first just bad health eating terrible dehydration drinkin too much

2009
02:02:42.06 --> 02:02:48.14
Your physiology when you're in that kind and that state of health feels like anxiety the increased heart rate

2010
02:02:48.14 --> 02:02:55.42
The sweaty palms the whole physiology it goes along with anxiety because of bad health

2011
02:02:55.90 --> 02:02:59.26
It's your physiology reacting to what you people are dumping in their bodies

2012
02:03:00.14 --> 02:03:02.14
my particular issue and

2013
02:03:02.86 --> 02:03:08.14
What I think health care should be is an individual evaluation of each person

2014
02:03:08.94 --> 02:03:13.66
To adjust their medical care for for that because I watch for years people take medication

2015
02:03:13.66 --> 02:03:19.18
for for migraine and then migraine doesn't go away, but they get another symptoms

2016
02:03:19.18 --> 02:03:20.86
So here's another medication for the symptom

2017
02:03:21.66 --> 02:03:24.38
Eight medications later the guys telling me

2018
02:03:25.42 --> 02:03:29.02
I still got a migraine and I can't remember what I did 15 minutes ago. I'm taking eight meds for it

2019
02:03:34.14 --> 02:03:36.14
I had

2020
02:03:36.14 --> 02:03:41.66
In your stomach you have for a bacteria that breaks up the food so your intestines can take the

2021
02:03:41.66 --> 02:03:46.46
Vitamins and nutrients in and I had no good floor in my stomach so my body

2022
02:03:47.50 --> 02:03:53.26
Physiologically couldn't even break down the food so when I got tested my urine my stool my blood

2023
02:03:54.14 --> 02:03:56.14
And they also used epigenetics

2024
02:03:56.94 --> 02:04:03.74
Which says your epigenetics your genetics say that your body will consume and you utilize certain types of food

2025
02:04:04.54 --> 02:04:06.14
Because of your genetics and where you're from

2026
02:04:06.14 --> 02:04:11.18
I would see a lot of guys in the seal teams everybody's on keto well, how do you know keto is good for you?

2027
02:04:11.98 --> 02:04:13.98
You might be hurt yourself or

2028
02:04:14.62 --> 02:04:16.86
I had the Greek slip for a long time. I would see the Greek diet

2029
02:04:17.42 --> 02:04:20.14
Might not be the one for you because your genetics don't

2030
02:04:20.86 --> 02:04:23.26
I mean, it might work but it might not be the opin

2031
02:04:26.06 --> 02:04:30.86
So I went on to fix mine all I had to do is take antibiotics for a week and then I rebuilt it with

2032
02:04:30.86 --> 02:04:35.18
Diet you know just probiotics and

2033
02:04:36.54 --> 02:04:43.50
This is to repair your gut floor after you did get tests. They study everything that's coming out of you they go. Oh, yeah, this is what you need

2034
02:04:44.38 --> 02:04:50.06
So my body couldn't even give me this nutrients because it wasn't physiologically working and I was completely beat efficient

2035
02:04:50.46 --> 02:04:51.66
Deed efficient

2036
02:04:51.66 --> 02:04:53.26
had all kinds of

2037
02:04:53.26 --> 02:04:55.26
spikes and heavy metals

2038
02:04:55.26 --> 02:05:00.70
Where was this while you were still enter is this after you retired and you started working for the care coalition?

2039
02:05:00.70 --> 02:05:02.86
It was when I was working for the care coalition

2040
02:05:03.34 --> 02:05:08.70
I've been there for probably six little over six years so you retired in 2010

2041
02:05:09.02 --> 02:05:13.10
Yeah, and where did you spend your last so this incident happened in 2000?

2042
02:05:13.10 --> 02:05:20.30
Would you spend your last seven years at a debt little creek and you were so I taught that course got it and then I was the operations officer

2043
02:05:20.30 --> 02:05:22.30
Which was the worst job ever

2044
02:05:22.30 --> 02:05:27.82
And then you but so then you retire out of there and you get this job at the care coalition which is

2045
02:05:28.38 --> 02:05:33.26
Special operations care coalition. Yeah, where where where are you located when you're doing that job?

2046
02:05:33.26 --> 02:05:38.06
Well, I'm still living in Virginia Beach, but I'm just the job changed when I was initially

2047
02:05:38.94 --> 02:05:41.66
hired for that job. I had all of the MSW Marseaux guys

2048
02:05:42.62 --> 02:05:46.38
And that is wherever they were so Marseaux is on both coast

2049
02:05:46.38 --> 02:05:54.22
So I'd go to Lissian once once a month. I'd flat the San Diego once a month. I'm hit the guys out there and a WM Marseaux

2050
02:05:55.02 --> 02:05:57.02
And we were putting guys in

2051
02:05:57.18 --> 02:06:02.22
If we could find a quality care that was sufficient we would put them somewhere

2052
02:06:02.54 --> 02:06:07.10
You know where they were from so they can hang out with the family and so you're you're when you're in that job

2053
02:06:07.10 --> 02:06:11.18
You're an advocate for all these wounded guys correct non medical case manager

2054
02:06:11.18 --> 02:06:16.54
Non medical case manager going okay, and this guys this kid will tell you hey, you know

2055
02:06:16.54 --> 02:06:22.54
I'm having problems with my ex girlfriend and we got to need to help with that or I mean just I need I want to get back home to my family or whatever

2056
02:06:23.18 --> 02:06:26.54
Issues that they're facing is that right was I ran guys through their

2057
02:06:27.02 --> 02:06:32.14
They were going through a medical retirement board. I was the advocate for that and I was the interface between

2058
02:06:33.42 --> 02:06:35.42
them and

2059
02:06:35.42 --> 02:06:37.42
And the pebble host

2060
02:06:37.42 --> 02:06:43.74
Physical valuation board liaison officers which weren't really good and what they did

2061
02:06:45.18 --> 02:06:47.18
So I did VA disability

2062
02:06:47.18 --> 02:06:49.18
I did wellness trips

2063
02:06:50.46 --> 02:06:53.98
There was a lot of care that you know, you know periplegic

2064
02:06:55.10 --> 02:06:58.30
Doesn't care that it's a test a test medication or

2065
02:06:58.94 --> 02:07:06.22
Test treatment they just want to walk again and you know sometimes our medical systems not gonna facilitate that so

2066
02:07:06.22 --> 02:07:10.46
Others will so we would facilitate treatments outside of network

2067
02:07:11.42 --> 02:07:16.62
So it's my job as I described it was to improve somebody's situation and

2068
02:07:17.58 --> 02:07:22.54
I did everything from baby sippers for people to

2069
02:07:22.54 --> 02:07:27.98
You know medical retirement boards. I mean, that was a better social worker than I was a seal

2070
02:07:27.98 --> 02:07:36.22
You talk about some of the cases you talk about you talk you know you go through this

2071
02:07:37.18 --> 02:07:39.02
You talk about some of the people that you helped out

2072
02:07:40.46 --> 02:07:45.10
Holly was one of my first clients when I met her she was only able to lie in bed and screaming at the top of her lungs

2073
02:07:45.10 --> 02:07:50.38
It was scary Holly was raised in port Angelys Washington and listed in the Navy after high school

2074
02:07:50.38 --> 02:07:54.30
She joined the military to create a future for herself and her family when I met her

2075
02:07:54.30 --> 02:07:56.62
She was still the bread winner for most of her family

2076
02:07:56.62 --> 02:08:02.14
She had become an independent duty corpsman which is the highest and listed medical care provider in the Navy

2077
02:08:02.30 --> 02:08:05.50
She graduated the program and become an Arabic linguist

2078
02:08:06.14 --> 02:08:11.82
Hospital corpsman chief pedi officer Holly crab tree was assigned to work with a seal team as they conducted various

2079
02:08:11.98 --> 02:08:13.98
Operations in Iraq

2080
02:08:13.98 --> 02:08:15.18
It was April 15th

2081
02:08:15.18 --> 02:08:19.82
2010. I just joined the care coalition and Holly was nearing the end of her deployment

2082
02:08:20.22 --> 02:08:23.34
She was out doing a medical civilian affairs operation

2083
02:08:23.34 --> 02:08:30.62
When she was shot the bullet pierced her helmet fractured a skull and settled behind her eye

2084
02:08:30.70 --> 02:08:32.30
She was not expected to live

2085
02:08:33.10 --> 02:08:37.90
Her crew realized that she was expecting and coded Holly's condition as

2086
02:08:38.22 --> 02:08:40.22
Holt trauma

2087
02:08:40.62 --> 02:08:42.62
She proved everybody wrong

2088
02:08:42.62 --> 02:08:45.02
Holly would not give up or stop working

2089
02:08:45.26 --> 02:08:50.06
She would have to relearn how to talk walk even swallow. I watched her do it all

2090
02:08:50.06 --> 02:08:55.82
It was both sad and humbling but most of all it made me very proud to know her

2091
02:08:56.70 --> 02:09:01.10
Holly since made an impressive recovery and is medically retired after 13 years of service

2092
02:09:03.02 --> 02:09:05.34
Had another guy he's in there Sam

2093
02:09:06.14 --> 02:09:08.14
Same thing shot in the same place

2094
02:09:09.66 --> 02:09:14.38
Both both um did he have to relearn everything as well? Yeah, and they both stroked

2095
02:09:14.38 --> 02:09:19.98
Paralyzed them on the right side of their body

2096
02:09:21.58 --> 02:09:24.62
He's uh he's working in a program right now where he goes after

2097
02:09:26.06 --> 02:09:30.54
Child pornographers and traffickers which is a huge problem in the country right now

2098
02:09:32.38 --> 02:09:35.10
Like what 500,000 children go missing every year in this country

2099
02:09:37.10 --> 02:09:40.46
That's insane. I mean, I'll show you real slavery that's happening right now

2100
02:09:40.46 --> 02:09:42.46
Now

2101
02:09:44.14 --> 02:09:52.30
As you're doing this stuff with other people this is when your starting to realize that you know you should get checked out yourself

2102
02:09:52.46 --> 02:09:56.30
Am I getting that right like in the timeline like this is when you start going hey man. I should get these tests

2103
02:09:57.58 --> 02:09:59.58
well

2104
02:09:59.58 --> 02:10:02.78
The only reason I did these tests was because I was having issues and

2105
02:10:03.90 --> 02:10:07.82
People around me like you're gonna go go get help go talk to somebody and I refuse to

2106
02:10:07.82 --> 02:10:13.58
And the reason why I went with this doctor was because it was a leasonvasive and I'll have to do is talk to him on

2107
02:10:14.94 --> 02:10:16.94
Skype

2108
02:10:16.94 --> 02:10:18.94
He wasn't even in the same state and

2109
02:10:19.98 --> 02:10:21.98
To an honest life

2110
02:10:21.98 --> 02:10:24.70
I kind of half-assed it and it worked

2111
02:10:27.74 --> 02:10:31.66
I've seen other people go through this to include people my own family and

2112
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:33.66
And

2113
02:10:34.78 --> 02:10:39.02
Everybody's issues could be different my was bad gut for I've seen people have had

2114
02:10:39.66 --> 02:10:42.78
H plyrory which is a parasite which is pretty prominent

2115
02:10:43.90 --> 02:10:45.90
which would

2116
02:10:45.90 --> 02:10:50.30
The symptoms really look like you're having issues with thyroid

2117
02:10:51.90 --> 02:10:53.90
So your initial

2118
02:10:53.90 --> 02:10:59.26
Reaction would be well you're having these issues. I'm gonna take you to end of chronologists and then we're gonna make you take these medications

2119
02:10:59.26 --> 02:11:02.70
So that we fry your thyroid when

2120
02:11:03.26 --> 02:11:07.66
All time it was just a parasite that you could just stop eating sugar and kill it and fix it

2121
02:11:08.70 --> 02:11:10.70
That's what health care should be

2122
02:11:11.10 --> 02:11:13.42
Health care right now is completely reactive

2123
02:11:14.14 --> 02:11:17.82
They don't treat the source of the illness or disease

2124
02:11:18.62 --> 02:11:20.62
They just treat the symptoms

2125
02:11:20.62 --> 02:11:27.10
Uh, what's like 250,000 people die every year because of medical mistake

2126
02:11:28.22 --> 02:11:30.38
And we're listening to these people they almost killed me too

2127
02:11:31.50 --> 02:11:32.70
With a

2128
02:11:32.70 --> 02:11:35.58
potassium. I almost had a heart attack because I had an overdose of potassium

2129
02:11:36.70 --> 02:11:40.22
When another seal who'd been shot in the eye right next door to me was almost overdosed

2130
02:11:41.90 --> 02:11:45.90
Ryan Joe was overdosed when he went in to get surgery just plastic surgery

2131
02:11:45.90 --> 02:11:52.78
And then and then they tried to lie about it. Um, yeah, and those were bad was civilian hospital

2132
02:11:52.78 --> 02:11:56.38
You know what wasn't that wasn't the military. That was civilian hospital

2133
02:11:56.94 --> 02:12:03.34
Medicine's not in his axions everybody's bodies different and that's why it should be evaluated individually because

2134
02:12:04.94 --> 02:12:09.10
I'm pretty narcotic resistant. I wake up in the middle surgeries

2135
02:12:09.10 --> 02:12:13.98
You gotta give me more narcotics to knock me out if you want to do a surgery. I'm gonna wake up and fight

2136
02:12:17.42 --> 02:12:22.46
Good luck in somebody to do surgery after you have to make these statements. I don't like to get hurt anymore. I don't think

2137
02:12:23.42 --> 02:12:25.42
hope

2138
02:12:26.38 --> 02:12:31.98
So you're learning a lot about that. You're also doing all like you said you're doing awesome stuff with with some of the people setting them up

2139
02:12:32.06 --> 02:12:34.06
You know you're doing haunt and trips

2140
02:12:34.78 --> 02:12:36.78
You end up

2141
02:12:36.78 --> 02:12:38.78
Climbing Mount Mount Renewer

2142
02:12:39.02 --> 02:12:46.38
Ryan Joe climbed that blind yeah, you be here before I did yeah, yeah, you say this about that you say our climate been not a Ryan Joe

2143
02:12:46.94 --> 02:12:51.18
Another Navy Sea will been wounded and I racked by a sniper in injury that had left him totally blind

2144
02:12:51.26 --> 02:12:55.02
I had met Ryan once at Mike Monters metal vonna ceremony at the White House

2145
02:12:56.14 --> 02:13:01.90
Which I think we were saying today that was the last time I saw the last time we saw each other before right now. It's good party. Yeah, it was

2146
02:13:01.90 --> 02:13:03.90
um

2147
02:13:04.14 --> 02:13:06.14
Good times

2148
02:13:08.54 --> 02:13:15.10
In 2008 Ryan Joe climbed to the summit of Mount Renewer blind a year later in 2009 he died as a result of

2149
02:13:16.06 --> 02:13:21.98
Hospital error most people know Ryan from the books American sniper and a warrior's faith

2150
02:13:22.78 --> 02:13:27.18
He was the character bigels in the film American sniper on my way down

2151
02:13:27.74 --> 02:13:30.94
I closed my eyes once and gained a new profound

2152
02:13:30.94 --> 02:13:35.34
Respect for Ryan Joe. I couldn't take 10 steps without opening my eyes

2153
02:13:38.78 --> 02:13:40.78
There's some bad parts of that

2154
02:13:41.42 --> 02:13:43.42
You tied to a damn rope to

2155
02:13:43.82 --> 02:13:49.74
I did that when we did that in the seal teams. What's the weather training? Yeah, I actually never did cold weather training

2156
02:13:51.02 --> 02:13:52.06
I hate it

2157
02:13:52.06 --> 02:13:55.82
I mean, I was in some cold spots, but I never you know, I got snowed on plenty

2158
02:13:55.82 --> 02:14:02.78
I froze plenty of times out in the sleet and snow, but I never I never did the cold weather the actual cold weather training

2159
02:14:04.06 --> 02:14:08.70
There's team two guys the old team two guys you still love that stuff. Oh, yeah for sure when I got there

2160
02:14:09.02 --> 02:14:14.14
When I got to team two, you know, I was hoping that I would get to be able to do that, but it was already

2161
02:14:14.70 --> 02:14:19.98
That program was it was no longer like the seal team two was that it's all different. Yeah

2162
02:14:22.06 --> 02:14:24.06
You end up going to

2163
02:14:24.06 --> 02:14:31.10
You end up checking out some kind of I guess was a called alternative medicine treatment alternative options. Oh, yeah

2164
02:14:33.34 --> 02:14:37.42
I went full hippie and I went to a place that was I mean, I like those things

2165
02:14:37.42 --> 02:14:39.58
I like the mindfulness practices

2166
02:14:40.38 --> 02:14:43.34
I should get back to meditating regularly. It does help

2167
02:14:44.46 --> 02:14:48.94
But I was introduced at this place to you know, shooting with a recurve

2168
02:14:48.94 --> 02:14:54.14
You know walk in those paths that made with rocks like that Indians used to do

2169
02:14:55.10 --> 02:14:58.62
So they teach a bunch of mindfulness practices and they were teaching transcendental meditation

2170
02:14:59.50 --> 02:15:01.50
And I think that's the part you're getting to right

2171
02:15:02.30 --> 02:15:06.78
Yeah, it sounds like like I mean the first thing happens you're doing this some acid trip or something

2172
02:15:06.78 --> 02:15:08.86
But yeah, no drugs and ball

2173
02:15:08.86 --> 02:15:16.14
Yeah, you're looking at a chair and all of a sudden the chair turns into human bones and then you guys are going down to do some

2174
02:15:16.14 --> 02:15:18.14
Some some

2175
02:15:18.14 --> 02:15:24.78
Therapy with horses and then then then we were to the book here wall the other participants went to the pen with the instructor

2176
02:15:24.78 --> 02:15:29.02
I stood outside the car out when I turned and looked at an instructor's face

2177
02:15:29.34 --> 02:15:33.90
It was like some type of Hollywood special effects scene. I was staring at him with his damn face

2178
02:15:34.22 --> 02:15:37.02
When his damn face morphed into an evil demon

2179
02:15:37.66 --> 02:15:41.74
I froze terrified and trembling it felt like every cell in my body was vibrating violently

2180
02:15:41.74 --> 02:15:43.98
I just stood there close my eyes and prayed

2181
02:15:43.98 --> 02:15:45.98
God please help me

2182
02:15:47.10 --> 02:15:50.94
I was sure these people were gonna hurt me when I hope my eyes everyone was gone

2183
02:15:50.94 --> 02:15:56.06
I need to get out of there. I saw the group standing in front of the car out and I said as calmly as I could

2184
02:15:56.38 --> 02:16:00.22
Hey guys, thanks for everything. This has been really good, but I need to leave right now

2185
02:16:00.86 --> 02:16:04.62
The instructor's tried to talk me out of leaving saying that it wasn't safe for me to go

2186
02:16:05.50 --> 02:16:09.50
And I stood there thinking well, it's definitely not safe for me to stay here with the demon dude

2187
02:16:09.50 --> 02:16:16.30
I tried to hide it, but I think one of the instructors may have known that I was freaked out one of the female instructors gave me a ride back to my cabin

2188
02:16:16.30 --> 02:16:18.30
I made her use her GPS

2189
02:16:18.30 --> 02:16:22.06
So I knew she was taking me when I arrived back the cabin

2190
02:16:22.06 --> 02:16:26.06
I grabbed my bag chucked into my truck and immediately started driving back to Virginia Beach

2191
02:16:28.22 --> 02:16:30.62
That was as relax was like fully real in your head

2192
02:16:32.22 --> 02:16:37.50
And I didn't want to research after that happened to me. That's when I started I had trouble sleeping after that

2193
02:16:37.50 --> 02:16:42.30
And started doing research and it's an event a quite a few people have

2194
02:16:44.22 --> 02:16:49.42
I thought it was interesting you immediately went and got a drug test a full drug test because you thought maybe you had been drug

2195
02:16:49.42 --> 02:16:51.42
I thought I was drug

2196
02:16:53.66 --> 02:16:55.66
I actually had to stop at a car accident

2197
02:16:56.22 --> 02:17:03.18
On the way out there. Yeah, you stopped at a car accident and so you kind of knew that you could you weren't on drugs because you were doing normal things

2198
02:17:03.18 --> 02:17:05.18
Uh

2199
02:17:06.86 --> 02:17:11.90
Well, I get in what you said you said you knew you weren't insane

2200
02:17:12.38 --> 02:17:15.50
Yeah, because that's why you thought it was drugs. That's what it was because I was

2201
02:17:16.30 --> 02:17:18.30
able to still be objective

2202
02:17:19.50 --> 02:17:21.10
That's when you know you're crazy when you can't keep

2203
02:17:21.66 --> 02:17:22.86
Objective

2204
02:17:22.86 --> 02:17:24.38
You're like am I crazy?

2205
02:17:24.38 --> 02:17:28.70
Like if you're if you're just completely denying the fact that you might be crazy

2206
02:17:28.70 --> 02:17:34.54
Then maybe you are you got back actually investigate it. That's a scary test dude

2207
02:17:35.10 --> 02:17:36.70
I don't know if I passed that old

2208
02:17:37.90 --> 02:17:43.98
But I mean this if you all the research I did on it it happens to a lot of people prominent people educated people

2209
02:17:44.86 --> 02:17:47.50
And I say in the book, you know, I either saw it happen

2210
02:17:48.54 --> 02:17:52.54
Because I have some people that like hey you just have the ability to see evil

2211
02:17:53.26 --> 02:17:57.02
It was a temporary psychotic break which hasn't happened since which I've tried to

2212
02:17:57.02 --> 02:17:59.82
Like man, I don't think that's happened again

2213
02:18:01.10 --> 02:18:04.22
With meditation because I think it was the meditation that did it that

2214
02:18:04.70 --> 02:18:07.42
Popped open different parts of my brain that I never used

2215
02:18:10.46 --> 02:18:14.14
But I cover my ass in there yeah, so people don't think hey, oh my god

2216
02:18:14.14 --> 02:18:17.42
The other thing is lunatic the Kundalini awakening

2217
02:18:17.74 --> 02:18:24.86
Yeah, that's how you had to go check that out. I watched some YouTube videos to figure out what a Kundalini awakening look like and it's like a yoga

2218
02:18:24.86 --> 02:18:29.34
Like you just we it says a weird like spiritual trip I guess

2219
02:18:30.38 --> 02:18:32.38
Yeah, and I would say I'm

2220
02:18:32.38 --> 02:18:37.26
Mike and few people I wear wear this ring, but I would say I'm a recovering Christian don't like religion

2221
02:18:38.06 --> 02:18:43.34
On the spiritual first and I know there's a god. I just he hasn't she hasn't whatever it is hasn't talked to me yet

2222
02:18:43.34 --> 02:18:48.06
So I don't know I don't know who's right. What's really 10 religions on this rock

2223
02:18:48.70 --> 02:18:50.70
There's a more than that

2224
02:18:50.70 --> 02:18:57.82
I guess because that bad trip you decided you were gonna still keep getting after it

2225
02:18:59.42 --> 02:19:02.38
There was a Elliot Miller another awesome seal

2226
02:19:04.38 --> 02:19:07.82
He'd been through some some TBI like treatments

2227
02:19:08.86 --> 02:19:11.58
He was he was wheelchair bound for a long time

2228
02:19:12.38 --> 02:19:14.38
Really overweight

2229
02:19:15.42 --> 02:19:19.74
So he went to that program at Carrack. Yeah, I did the fundraiser for yeah

2230
02:19:19.74 --> 02:19:25.26
Yeah, so you see you do this you end up doing this some you end up trying to figure out how you can raise money

2231
02:19:26.14 --> 02:19:28.70
And and the way you figure out you can raise money is

2232
02:19:30.46 --> 02:19:34.78
Is by doing a triathlon I did a half iron man half iron man

2233
02:19:35.58 --> 02:19:40.46
So I tried to do a full that's that's what I was trading for that that's what everything came down

2234
02:19:41.18 --> 02:19:45.58
So you end up doing the the short one. I'll call it short. I mean it's pretty long

2235
02:19:45.58 --> 02:19:47.58
I guess 13 miles and what is short?

2236
02:19:47.58 --> 02:19:52.62
It's short for triathlon we doing two in a row is exponentially so much harder than that

2237
02:19:53.42 --> 02:19:55.90
I didn't do diabetes because I didn't know enough about nutrition

2238
02:19:57.26 --> 02:20:02.86
Did you do that diabetes before the first one? No while you were training for the second one for the full iron man

2239
02:20:03.18 --> 02:20:05.18
So you do the you do the first one and

2240
02:20:06.38 --> 02:20:09.02
Everyone's all happy you raise $135,000

2241
02:20:10.06 --> 02:20:15.74
Folks at iron man contact you and say hey you're great you gonna subunch of publicity and it's awesome

2242
02:20:15.74 --> 02:20:21.02
Because money Chris Pratt did it with me too. Chris Pratt did it with you. I'm sure they wanted to get some of that. I didn't really was

2243
02:20:23.66 --> 02:20:25.66
Guardians of the galaxy

2244
02:20:25.66 --> 02:20:28.30
Oh that won't stupid movie with a wreck talking wrecking

2245
02:20:28.86 --> 02:20:34.22
Maybe he's not like I'm I'm a fan of Chris now. Yeah, no he seems like a great guy. I'm madam

2246
02:20:34.22 --> 02:20:43.42
Um, but then this happens so they tell you hey you can do another you know we'll sponsor you or whatever you can do it

2247
02:20:44.30 --> 02:20:47.82
And so you start now training for this and here you go

2248
02:20:47.82 --> 02:20:53.58
I was totally exhausted and burned out before the half iron man now was truck training for double the distance

2249
02:20:53.98 --> 02:21:00.30
After the race the first race the words spread about what I was doing and new donors came to my crowd rise page to support me

2250
02:21:00.30 --> 02:21:05.82
Doing the full iron man, but I was at a point where I just could not do my job anymore. I was totally burned out

2251
02:21:06.14 --> 02:21:11.98
And the iron man fund raising and training did nothing but add to my stress everything started to escalate my mind

2252
02:21:11.98 --> 02:21:14.70
I could feel something was on the verge of breaking

2253
02:21:15.50 --> 02:21:21.66
The stress of work training and financial obligations were all becoming too much. I couldn't sleep becoming edgy and difficult to get along with

2254
02:21:21.90 --> 02:21:23.42
On the best of days

2255
02:21:23.42 --> 02:21:29.74
45 days before the corner race. I emailed the iron man folks to thank them for the opportunity and backed out of the race. I

2256
02:21:30.86 --> 02:21:35.18
Contacted every donor and offered them to return all their money. I was a mess at work

2257
02:21:35.18 --> 02:21:42.22
I couldn't I would get urgent calls from shrinks who would say stuff like come get your guys some of my clients would scare the medical

2258
02:21:42.62 --> 02:21:47.82
Staff and the doctors knew if they called the police all held break loose so they called me instead

2259
02:21:47.82 --> 02:21:53.42
I would have to go diffuse the situation these evolutions were exhausting and looking back

2260
02:21:53.42 --> 02:21:57.18
They were all well beyond by area of expertise. I would do the minimum

2261
02:21:57.58 --> 02:22:03.58
Reporting at work then try to sleep or play video games and attempt to distract myself from the constant fear of something bad happening

2262
02:22:03.58 --> 02:22:05.58
I was trapped without an escape route

2263
02:22:06.54 --> 02:22:11.66
Stress accumulates and it was all piling up inside of me. I had no financial help and I'm not one to ask for any

2264
02:22:11.82 --> 02:22:17.26
I was sure there I was going to get fired from my job. This was only the second real job I'd ever had in my life

2265
02:22:17.26 --> 02:22:21.90
Other than being in the Navy. I fell embarrassed and ashamed and amasculated

2266
02:22:21.90 --> 02:22:26.78
I would not leave my home for days on end. I avoided talking to people even turned off my phone

2267
02:22:27.10 --> 02:22:32.78
Brenda was troubled she knows me so well she was gentle at first asked me if I wanted to talk to someone as

2268
02:22:32.78 --> 02:22:36.70
I became more isolated and combat if she reached out to my friends and co-workers

2269
02:22:36.94 --> 02:22:40.54
They joined with her and together they all how did me to get help in

2270
02:22:40.54 --> 02:22:47.10
In a year I'd gone from training to do an iron man triathlon to not being able to get off my couch. I was in a dark

2271
02:22:47.26 --> 02:22:51.50
Dangerous place my life had become unbearable there was guilt

2272
02:22:52.30 --> 02:22:58.86
But I think the real culprit was shame guilt and shame are very different and controlled my thoughts and behaviors and distinct ways

2273
02:22:59.10 --> 02:23:02.38
guilt was about what I had done or in my case what I hadn't done

2274
02:23:02.94 --> 02:23:07.74
Shame was about who I was or at least who at least who I thought I was I felt like a

2275
02:23:07.74 --> 02:23:14.78
A prisoner being brainwashed every day my mind seemed to be stuck on a one track narrative that became darker with each episode

2276
02:23:15.34 --> 02:23:21.10
Every minute of every day there was this weird repeating internal myologue monologue that opened with guilt

2277
02:23:21.26 --> 02:23:28.30
Which created a feeling of shame. I would fixate on things that supported this monologue like bailing out of the iron man

2278
02:23:28.38 --> 02:23:34.22
Which I was which I was sure disappointed the donors the treatment facility my clients and my family

2279
02:23:34.22 --> 02:23:37.58
My anemic efforts at work reinforced my shame

2280
02:23:38.14 --> 02:23:42.14
That's when all the what ifs began chiming in what if I get fired from my job?

2281
02:23:42.14 --> 02:23:44.30
Will we lose the new house and all my money?

2282
02:23:44.30 --> 02:23:49.02
one of the people who donated to my fundraiser think I'm a fraud because I didn't do the full iron man

2283
02:23:49.10 --> 02:23:52.46
These thoughts would lead to embarrassment which deep into my feelings of shame

2284
02:23:52.46 --> 02:23:58.90
I was trapped in this desperate repeating irrational monologue that sounded all rational to me

2285
02:23:58.90 --> 02:24:00.90
I

2286
02:24:02.58 --> 02:24:08.90
Percelling new people like Dan Marcali and Tyler who had far worse injuries than me and far more stressful lives

2287
02:24:09.14 --> 02:24:13.06
And who are all managing themselves well, but for some reason I just couldn't put things in perspective

2288
02:24:13.46 --> 02:24:19.94
I was locked in an irrational disproportionate escalating mental prison. I sat in my truck

2289
02:24:22.74 --> 02:24:27.38
I had researched how to do it exactly where to place the barrel and how to angle the gun

2290
02:24:27.38 --> 02:24:33.78
I had practiced it with a cleared weapon and pulled the trigger. I didn't want to leave a mess for someone else to clean up

2291
02:24:36.18 --> 02:24:40.42
I would not do it in my trucks or someone else could use it the bullet would go through my heart

2292
02:24:40.42 --> 02:24:43.22
There would be an instant of pain and then I would be gone

2293
02:24:45.38 --> 02:24:51.62
I would do to myself with one bullet what four enemy fighters failed to accomplish with 27

2294
02:24:51.62 --> 02:24:57.30
I Stared at the black gun in my hand. I'd use one like this to kill before

2295
02:24:57.70 --> 02:25:01.54
I was numb and sad confused and tired I had cried alone so many times

2296
02:25:01.78 --> 02:25:06.74
My downward spiral had come to its final resting place at the bottom was hopelessness

2297
02:25:08.58 --> 02:25:12.82
The built-up stress the lingering effects of trauma my psychological deficits all

2298
02:25:13.22 --> 02:25:15.62
Caluded to create a condition of hopelessness

2299
02:25:15.62 --> 02:25:22.34
My mind worked trying to come up with an explanation to justify my final act to my two beautiful daughters years ago

2300
02:25:22.34 --> 02:25:26.66
In that room at that compound the thought of not being able to see their faces again terrified me

2301
02:25:28.50 --> 02:25:32.58
Images flashed in my mind holding my daughters little hand in her own as we sat together

2302
02:25:32.90 --> 02:25:38.42
The way the girls would wrap their arms around my neck and hug me their soft little voices called out oh dad

2303
02:25:38.42 --> 02:25:43.62
They're smiling faces repeatedly flashed in my mind

2304
02:25:46.98 --> 02:25:50.90
There was the disproportionate feeling of guilt and shame that relentlessly stalked me

2305
02:25:51.22 --> 02:25:58.26
I felt trapped in a life layered with overwhelming stress andless responsibilities meaningless task and toxic people of

2306
02:25:58.50 --> 02:26:01.22
whom I felt I was the most toxic

2307
02:26:02.98 --> 02:26:04.98
It was all my fault

2308
02:26:04.98 --> 02:26:08.98
I felt I was my own worst enemy this time there was a bullet in the chamber

2309
02:26:09.62 --> 02:26:12.66
I was beyond contemplation my mind was made up

2310
02:26:12.66 --> 02:26:18.26
I mentally paced back and forth working up the courage the same way I had when I hit my father with the bat

2311
02:26:20.26 --> 02:26:24.18
I was getting out of my truck when my phone rang I looked down at the number

2312
02:26:26.10 --> 02:26:28.42
It was Scott Heinz my boss

2313
02:26:29.70 --> 02:26:32.42
I picked up the phone in one hand and held a gun in the other

2314
02:26:32.42 --> 02:26:35.22
I let it ring not wanting to answer

2315
02:26:36.50 --> 02:26:42.42
I couldn't do it with Scott calling so I put down the gun I answered hey Scott what's up?

2316
02:26:45.06 --> 02:26:48.82
It's got says Mike I want you to take the next three months to chill out

2317
02:26:48.82 --> 02:26:52.02
I'm gonna pay you relax take your time and find a new job

2318
02:26:52.02 --> 02:26:56.50
I'll help you out however I can you're beyond burned out you did amazing work

2319
02:26:56.50 --> 02:27:01.46
But there's a time limit for how long you can do this job and you maxed it out my

2320
02:27:03.62 --> 02:27:09.22
Boss and good friend to just give me the hope I needed to climb out of the very deep hole I'd found myself in and that

2321
02:27:09.22 --> 02:27:12.58
Instant I could not have answered my phone for anyone other than Scott

2322
02:27:13.46 --> 02:27:15.46
Scott had seen it all before

2323
02:27:15.46 --> 02:27:19.46
He knew that I was surrounded by wounded sick and injured people all day

2324
02:27:19.78 --> 02:27:25.62
Scott also knew that many of the people who I'd been meeting with every day for years including patients their family members

2325
02:27:25.62 --> 02:27:30.18
Veteran service members and hospital staff were struggling with depression

2326
02:27:30.18 --> 02:27:35.22
It's like an alcohol attending a bar you can only hold out for so long if you're around

2327
02:27:35.86 --> 02:27:40.10
Depressed people all the time you become depressed too

2328
02:27:42.34 --> 02:27:45.86
I suspect that some of you reading this may now think that I'm crazy and write me off

2329
02:27:46.18 --> 02:27:51.22
Thank you for coming this far with me for the rest of you whoever ever been depressed or suicidal

2330
02:27:51.22 --> 02:27:57.86
I can tell you that while I fully believe that the time that I was thinking rationally I know now that I was not

2331
02:27:59.86 --> 02:28:04.74
My irrational thoughts had started repeating themselves the world will be better off without me

2332
02:28:04.74 --> 02:28:10.10
I don't care anymore. I just want out of here. I'm a horrible person my future will just be filled with more of the same stress

2333
02:28:10.42 --> 02:28:14.74
These thoughts seem totally rational and true in my compromise state

2334
02:28:14.74 --> 02:28:19.54
But I had no idea that my thinking was compromised

2335
02:28:21.14 --> 02:28:26.26
What scared me the most about these thoughts and the entire experience is what happened to me just a few months later

2336
02:28:26.58 --> 02:28:34.02
Brenda in her desperation to help convinced me to visit a physician who had a protocol to treat depression and other conditions

2337
02:28:34.02 --> 02:28:43.62
I Resisted at first of course, but finally agreed to work with the guy if only to get Brenda and everyone else off my back

2338
02:28:48.66 --> 02:28:50.66
That's why I did

2339
02:28:54.26 --> 02:28:56.26
Man

2340
02:28:56.26 --> 02:29:03.62
You get it's interesting, you know, you talk about the um

2341
02:29:05.06 --> 02:29:11.86
Like now you can look back and see that you want rational. Oh, yeah, but at the time there's just you know

2342
02:29:12.18 --> 02:29:14.18
It's a chemical about I mean

2343
02:29:16.10 --> 02:29:21.14
It's be more people are coming aware of it now that the gut brain access

2344
02:29:21.14 --> 02:29:24.74
I mean

2345
02:29:26.74 --> 02:29:31.06
The gut is probably a smarter brain than the one in our skull

2346
02:29:33.14 --> 02:29:37.78
It can't operate properly unless unless you put proper nutrients and

2347
02:29:40.34 --> 02:29:44.02
And vitamins and this doctor is also really big into the EMF

2348
02:29:44.74 --> 02:29:49.14
electromagnetic fields, you know, you know how we're affected. I mean we had

2349
02:29:49.14 --> 02:29:56.34
Radio antennas over in Iraq and Afghanistan, you could put popcorn kernels in it. Pop popcorn. What do you think that does to your

2350
02:29:57.70 --> 02:30:01.46
Do you think that does to your skull and your organs and your cells?

2351
02:30:02.66 --> 02:30:04.66
We already

2352
02:30:04.66 --> 02:30:07.62
Residents as a weapon you can use microwaves to make people sick

2353
02:30:08.98 --> 02:30:10.98
Where yeah, I was a radio man unfortunately

2354
02:30:11.94 --> 02:30:16.02
Love the job, but I mean sat all all those antennas man. I was

2355
02:30:16.02 --> 02:30:22.34
Possibly here's a young guy getting we took the what was that thing called the bat one?

2356
02:30:23.14 --> 02:30:25.14
Yeah, the vehicle antenna for the satellite

2357
02:30:25.70 --> 02:30:30.42
We figured it well one of our new guys put it on on the radio with a switch

2358
02:30:30.98 --> 02:30:32.50
So this

2359
02:30:32.50 --> 02:30:35.62
My sees running right and look like Inspector Gadget, you know with helicopter

2360
02:30:36.50 --> 02:30:38.74
And you had that bat wing hanging out over top of his head

2361
02:30:38.74 --> 02:30:42.82
I don't I don't think sat transmissions are very healthy but

2362
02:30:46.34 --> 02:30:51.06
Frequencies you know residents we can use his weapon it could be used for the heal

2363
02:30:55.70 --> 02:30:59.38
Microwaves they've been used a lot to make people sick

2364
02:31:00.58 --> 02:31:06.10
So so you go through all that you kind of get this doctor doctor back so to put you on

2365
02:31:06.10 --> 02:31:11.78
A path like a new mission of you're gonna clean up your diet. You're gonna stay away from these

2366
02:31:13.38 --> 02:31:21.06
situations the Bluetooth limit your limit your exposure to your eye fine all this stuff which is hard. Oh, yeah for sure the you methods hard

2367
02:31:21.70 --> 02:31:23.70
so

2368
02:31:24.26 --> 02:31:26.26
Pretty much blew that off

2369
02:31:27.14 --> 02:31:32.34
So what did you mostly what did you mostly fix your diet mostly it was diet got my gut

2370
02:31:32.34 --> 02:31:34.98
Back right so that it

2371
02:31:35.78 --> 02:31:39.38
Because the way that works you're got prepares the food for the intestines for the intestines

2372
02:31:39.38 --> 02:31:43.06
What they do and the stomach doesn't work then that just it's gonna pass through

2373
02:31:43.70 --> 02:31:47.14
The intestines are not gonna be able to pull the nutrients and vitamins and I

2374
02:31:48.02 --> 02:31:51.78
Don't think any medication now I I am taking Mitch's

2375
02:31:53.38 --> 02:31:55.38
Smash ingredients

2376
02:31:55.38 --> 02:32:00.28
I started off with this doctor put me on a stuff called green juice from organic

2377
02:32:00.28 --> 02:32:02.28
Fine

2378
02:32:02.28 --> 02:32:05.80
So it's it's got all the you can have in one shake all the nutrients

2379
02:32:06.60 --> 02:32:11.08
You know one scoop of protein and one scoop of greens that's all you need

2380
02:32:12.60 --> 02:32:14.44
Pretty I mean we could live on algae and

2381
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.000
You'll go to these cool lunches that these kids were getting not now because of COVID, but

2382
02:32:20.04 --> 02:32:21.64
I mean they would feed them crap

2383
02:32:21.88 --> 02:32:27.16
They're actually making them sick. They're not helping them. Yeah, I mean like tomatoes with like

2384
02:32:27.16 --> 02:32:30.68
Crapy hamburger meat on it. Yeah, if it's even hamburger meat

2385
02:32:31.80 --> 02:32:33.80
If it's hamburger meat, it's not great

2386
02:32:35.32 --> 02:32:40.44
So so you get done you go on this protocol and you say this it took about two months and even then I

2387
02:32:41.16 --> 02:32:42.36
I

2388
02:32:42.36 --> 02:32:46.84
Would shop for all the foods meticulously prepare the meat measure all the meals

2389
02:32:47.80 --> 02:32:53.88
Keep the detailed food log. I'm sure the process was gradual one day woke up and felt like the black cloud that I had been

2390
02:32:53.88 --> 02:32:58.24
That had been hovering over me with for years was gone. I was able to function to move and

2391
02:32:58.24 --> 02:33:03.96
Feed quickly. Thankfully the fog had lifted and the constant negative internal monologue inside my head stopped

2392
02:33:03.96 --> 02:33:09.000
I felt strong clear and confident enough to get up and start moving forward

2393
02:33:11.24 --> 02:33:17.32
Grab my phone opened up my contact list and started sending text text messages and making calls

2394
02:33:17.72 --> 02:33:19.72
I needed a new job

2395
02:33:19.72 --> 02:33:22.20
And that's when you ended up going to trade it

2396
02:33:22.20 --> 02:33:28.12
Back to trade it as a contractor. I went back to teaching military freefall where prior injury

2397
02:33:29.48 --> 02:33:36.20
I had three events where I couldn't open my main parachute because my right scapula would seize up my whole back in my hand

2398
02:33:36.20 --> 02:33:39.40
Went and works. I had three high-fet high-speed melt functions

2399
02:33:39.96 --> 02:33:43.40
Went to reserve in the last one rip my pack off my

2400
02:33:44.20 --> 02:33:47.96
Connects between your arm. Did you get surgery? Yeah, they reconnected it

2401
02:33:47.96 --> 02:33:52.52
But it was a slot there the whole pack came out of right here

2402
02:33:53.80 --> 02:33:58.36
Dang so then I went to CQC and so yeah, which is which was awesome

2403
02:33:59.40 --> 02:34:04.44
Because the TTPs changed because of me. Yeah, that's that's

2404
02:34:05.80 --> 02:34:12.20
Perfect place for you to go and teach me what better person be teaching about out-of-hand little close-quarters combat that someone and don't do it

2405
02:34:12.20 --> 02:34:18.04
I mean, we still teach that but there's there's better ways to do things some

2406
02:34:19.72 --> 02:34:23.40
Different tactics you can use in different situations you can't just do the same thing every time

2407
02:34:24.84 --> 02:34:26.84
And then how long did you stay there for?

2408
02:34:27.80 --> 02:34:29.80
Uh

2409
02:34:30.36 --> 02:34:35.72
Because you're you're you're retired now from that job as well, right? So what is it 2020 quick

2410
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
18

2411
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.24
I was I was probably at trade-up between those two jobs for about three years. Okay

2412
02:34:44.12 --> 02:34:50.04
Awesome. Yeah, that's just let that like last October. I think that's it. It's a cool thing that the teams do bring in

2413
02:34:50.28 --> 02:34:54.92
Older guys back that have experience at some of the younger guys might not have especially someone with experience like you and

2414
02:34:55.16 --> 02:34:59.80
Bring them in there to teach and pass on those words man. That's freaking awesome that that we do that in the teams

2415
02:34:59.80 --> 02:35:03.96
I learned a lot there being an instructor and like you were talking about earlier, you know watching

2416
02:35:03.96 --> 02:35:10.76
Um 20 different groups come through people do different things in different ways and like man that was really stupid or man

2417
02:35:11.48 --> 02:35:13.48
I wish I would have thought of that

2418
02:35:14.84 --> 02:35:19.40
You ended up getting some tattoos and this was cool. You know Mike Martin

2419
02:35:20.44 --> 02:35:26.60
Who's a master chief team guy that was in Vietnam who had gotten out of the god now for like a long time

2420
02:35:26.84 --> 02:35:31.64
Well, he was at training cell at team three when I got there. Yeah, he had gotten out for a long time then he gone

2421
02:35:31.64 --> 02:35:36.52
But join the region of the Navy and back to Buds. I don't think they made him do

2422
02:35:38.12 --> 02:35:44.60
Real buds. Yeah, they he's like one of a few people that went through like a gentleman's course of buds. You know

2423
02:35:44.76 --> 02:35:49.24
Well, then we had to retread my class. I didn't make it was he a reach-ed Vietnam vet

2424
02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.72
I believe so really he was terrible. Dang that's kind of like Martin's

2425
02:35:55.72 --> 02:36:01.08
Well, he passed away last year on the other side and I'll tell you what he was only 62

2426
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:08.68
Bro we were I was we use call he was gonna come on the podcast and and and like I was lined it up with you know

2427
02:36:08.68 --> 02:36:13.32
one of our mutual friends and and we're just you know just trying to find the date and boom

2428
02:36:13.88 --> 02:36:18.60
Yeah, I was freaking so bummed out that was the first Navy seal book. I haven't read many but

2429
02:36:19.32 --> 02:36:20.68
Navy seals don't ring Navy seal

2430
02:36:20.68 --> 02:36:22.68
Fuck

2431
02:36:23.24 --> 02:36:25.24
You know there's so many of them too so many jokes

2432
02:36:25.72 --> 02:36:28.92
I was just hanging out with black rifle and I was like, yeah, you guys want to sell books in here

2433
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:31.64
You know the military books. I was like yeah, it's a good idea

2434
02:36:31.64 --> 02:36:35.16
But we'll have to reinforce the shelf for all the Navy seal books like your asshole

2435
02:36:35.56 --> 02:36:41.32
Well, I was sitting down with the black rifle guys up in Montana and it was me and

2436
02:36:42.68 --> 02:36:47.40
Dudley the Dartsury guy and and then and then and then Jack Carr was

2437
02:36:47.40 --> 02:36:53.32
What's his name the other owner small or it was Evan it was Evan that was who was there

2438
02:36:53.32 --> 02:36:56.12
It was just so I think it was because the other guy I got hurt. I thought he got hurt

2439
02:36:56.12 --> 02:37:03.96
Yeah, not got hurt. Yeah, so he couldn't come but anyways, we sit down and and you know Evan makes a joke about seals writing books

2440
02:37:04.76 --> 02:37:11.96
And did it to me too and then of course I looked at him and I was like because I mean it's a funny joke. Yes, but then we were actually sit with two

2441
02:37:11.96 --> 02:37:18.52
Seals that have written books. I was like, oh, this is really embarrassing. I go real funny Evan

2442
02:37:20.12 --> 02:37:24.12
They're a great group of guys. They're definitely doing their job paying it forward first year, man

2443
02:37:24.36 --> 02:37:29.08
For sure. I mean, I was really bummed out when I saw well first of all when I found up at you into the Toulower tree

2444
02:37:29.08 --> 02:37:32.68
Challenge there and I just did I don't know why didn't put two and two together

2445
02:37:33.24 --> 02:37:36.68
Well, I didn't find out until after you left Montana. Yeah, so I was like

2446
02:37:36.68 --> 02:37:43.08
But then the other thing I didn't know is I knew I knew that they were doing something with with wounded warriors

2447
02:37:44.28 --> 02:37:48.04
I I know what they were doing. I didn't really grasp it again. I just didn't pay enough attention

2448
02:37:48.04 --> 02:37:52.28
But I could I should have gone down there for that look for you know awesome what they rolled into a

2449
02:37:52.84 --> 02:37:58.76
huge archery event afterwards. So we there was 25 of us. I was one of two guys. It wasn't an MPT

2450
02:37:59.32 --> 02:38:01.32
There was a dude there that didn't have a right arm

2451
02:38:02.04 --> 02:38:04.28
I saw videos of him you fight that thing

2452
02:38:04.28 --> 02:38:06.28
Yep

2453
02:38:06.28 --> 02:38:11.24
And awesome too. Yeah, I didn't shit that like a hundred and eight yards. Yeah, there's something real cool about archery that

2454
02:38:12.28 --> 02:38:17.40
That it has a lot of similarities, you know to the old job, you know, I like shooting a bow better

2455
02:38:17.80 --> 02:38:22.28
Yeah, I do too. I like shooting a bow better the main reason is because it's quiet

2456
02:38:22.28 --> 02:38:24.12
It's like there's no like little shock

2457
02:38:24.36 --> 02:38:27.24
It's just nice and quiet. You can do it in your yard and it's harder

2458
02:38:27.72 --> 02:38:33.40
Actually, yeah, it is harder well to definitely harder at range and then you pick up a recurve

2459
02:38:33.40 --> 02:38:35.80
I haven't done the recurve thing. Yeah, that's cool

2460
02:38:36.28 --> 02:38:41.16
Is that what you're like primarily shooting is a recurve? These were compounds, but I've got a couple of recurves

2461
02:38:41.16 --> 02:38:46.20
And it's all instinctive. Yeah, yeah, you just ain't even well you can't it? There's no sights

2462
02:38:46.52 --> 02:38:49.56
There's no refrains that you can tell if you went dead and go it is totally

2463
02:38:50.60 --> 02:38:54.76
Yeah, there's a couple of guys that were trying to do some long shots up in Montana with the recurres man

2464
02:38:55.24 --> 02:39:02.60
Yeah, looks fun. Looks fun. I don't know if I got a lot of work to do on the compound before I decided I'm gonna make it even harder

2465
02:39:02.60 --> 02:39:05.40
Yeah, you just turned up the juice on that right

2466
02:39:06.60 --> 02:39:08.60
Man

2467
02:39:08.60 --> 02:39:13.16
Yeah, so what are I'm guys hitting stuff at 108 yards? How hard can it be? That's freaking awesome. Only got one arm

2468
02:39:13.96 --> 02:39:17.24
I'm gonna awesome and just freaking out low-paz

2469
02:39:21.80 --> 02:39:23.80
Get close here, but you know you say this

2470
02:39:24.68 --> 02:39:29.64
In macing strange, but being shot 27 times then having a hang grenade flow up next to me

2471
02:39:29.64 --> 02:39:34.52
Was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It was the start of a personal revolution that continues today

2472
02:39:34.52 --> 02:39:41.08
And hopefully we'll go on until I take my last breath. I say revolution rather than evolution as a result of my experience

2473
02:39:41.08 --> 02:39:48.20
I have tossed out and or abandoned in every bias relationship belief and dogma that has blocked myself awareness and

2474
02:39:48.92 --> 02:39:50.92
joy

2475
02:39:52.92 --> 02:39:56.28
You said and again, I'm reading this stuff because I know that there's

2476
02:39:56.28 --> 02:40:00.28
People and people talk to me all the time about what they're going through and

2477
02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.40
You know what you say here. I think is really important

2478
02:40:04.52 --> 02:40:06.52
I burn through a number of therapists

2479
02:40:06.92 --> 02:40:13.88
Some were good most didn't have what I needed to help me understand how the traumas of my childhood shaped me as a person and how those same traumas

2480
02:40:14.20 --> 02:40:15.72
Make some of my behaviors

2481
02:40:15.96 --> 02:40:17.48
predictable at times

2482
02:40:17.48 --> 02:40:21.56
I had to be pushed into seeing therapists and doctors by people who loved and cared about me

2483
02:40:21.56 --> 02:40:27.32
I don't know if I can ever think these people enough for not giving up on me when I was so rude and resistant toward them

2484
02:40:28.20 --> 02:40:31.40
I say all of this so you know that at least for me

2485
02:40:31.56 --> 02:40:38.68
There has been no magic pill quick fix or one size fits all solution to finding peace and joy in my life

2486
02:40:39.08 --> 02:40:44.92
These things have come to me slowly over the past decade as I grew in self-awareness and courage

2487
02:40:44.92 --> 02:40:52.28
I suspect your personal peace if that's what you're searching for maybe gained much the same way

2488
02:40:55.40 --> 02:40:57.40
Yeah, you know, I think that

2489
02:40:58.28 --> 02:40:59.96
That uh

2490
02:40:59.96 --> 02:41:05.08
Just letting people know like somebody thinks oh, I'm gonna go see a therapist and it doesn't work out because that therapist doesn't have with that

2491
02:41:05.08 --> 02:41:10.52
Perpetent particular person needs and then they go I'll see I can't be helped instead of saying oh, you know what?

2492
02:41:10.52 --> 02:41:13.80
I gotta try some different people. What's a sidedle to um

2493
02:41:16.52 --> 02:41:18.28
People think that they you know

2494
02:41:19.56 --> 02:41:22.76
Could take you years to get into a terrible mindset

2495
02:41:23.56 --> 02:41:28.92
Betches training telling yourself doing all the things that make you believe the things that that you're telling yourself

2496
02:41:29.72 --> 02:41:33.56
And then you hit rock bottom or what you think rock bottom and you're like I really get this fix

2497
02:41:33.56 --> 02:41:35.16
I'm gonna go to this one week program

2498
02:41:35.56 --> 02:41:37.80
You know it took me two years to turn into this

2499
02:41:37.80 --> 02:41:42.92
Disaster area and I'm I think I'm gonna go to a one week program. I'm gonna fix it

2500
02:41:43.48 --> 02:41:47.88
And a lot of these programs that I watch when I was at the care coalition it does help, but there's no follow-up

2501
02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.16
So there's an improvement while they're there because everybody's you know feed them good food

2502
02:41:54.44 --> 02:41:56.44
teaching them the things that

2503
02:41:56.44 --> 02:42:01.32
They can use to you know relieve stress and they do that while they're there

2504
02:42:02.52 --> 02:42:05.000
And then they go home and then they just fall back into the same routine

2505
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.72
Training themselves to get further into that hole

2506
02:42:08.36 --> 02:42:09.72
I mean

2507
02:42:09.72 --> 02:42:11.72
That's what medicine is right now

2508
02:42:11.72 --> 02:42:15.72
Yeah, people get sick. They think that they can take a a medication. It's gonna make

2509
02:42:16.28 --> 02:42:20.04
Make the sickness go away. You're not even addressing wires sick. You're just

2510
02:42:22.44 --> 02:42:24.44
Hiding the symptoms

2511
02:42:26.44 --> 02:42:31.24
I mean like I earlier I said I actually didn't do diabetes and it was because I didn't know enough

2512
02:42:31.24 --> 02:42:35.08
Batin iteration and the only thing I knew about nutrition is if I was hungry or not and

2513
02:42:36.12 --> 02:42:40.36
My favorite restaurants were the ones that gave me the most food. I think care what it was

2514
02:42:42.76 --> 02:42:46.92
You know extra large peaches of myself galinized cream and a total pack of beer. You know, that's

2515
02:42:48.04 --> 02:42:51.40
That's the winning path but it'd be not definitely not

2516
02:42:54.52 --> 02:42:56.52
It's funny too because we all know

2517
02:42:56.52 --> 02:42:58.52
Uh

2518
02:42:59.08 --> 02:43:00.84
Even since we were a little kid you are what you eat

2519
02:43:01.80 --> 02:43:06.84
But we know it but we don't practice it and then you got the FDA with it stupid food pyramid

2520
02:43:07.88 --> 02:43:11.88
You know, you've got people now. Oh my stuff's at the a-proof. I'm like so what

2521
02:43:13.08 --> 02:43:14.76
Corrupt organization

2522
02:43:14.76 --> 02:43:18.68
Go eat five loaves of bread like they told you to no wonder everybody's fat. Yeah

2523
02:43:19.40 --> 02:43:22.04
Can you say pre-diabetic oh and then they take

2524
02:43:22.04 --> 02:43:28.76
Medication I mean type two diabetes. Oh, you gotta do change your diet goes away. I did it

2525
02:43:29.88 --> 02:43:31.88
I induced it with cliff bars

2526
02:43:32.92 --> 02:43:37.96
Gatorade I was needing twinkies. Yeah, I was just you're thinking what seemed like it's cool

2527
02:43:38.36 --> 02:43:41.000
Yeah, well, and I was also being trained by an ultra-thinner

2528
02:43:42.68 --> 02:43:43.96
And

2529
02:43:43.96 --> 02:43:45.96
Third-dummer than we are

2530
02:43:45.96 --> 02:43:47.96
Who goes and runs out of my

2531
02:43:47.96 --> 02:43:49.96
Ha

2532
02:43:50.20 --> 02:43:57.24
She take my ass man and I just didn't know enough about an interest and and I was just dumping carbs and sugars in the man

2533
02:43:58.68 --> 02:44:02.04
Every time I stood up I was almost passing out. Let's die be these

2534
02:44:03.64 --> 02:44:06.12
Crazy, see as I fixed it and went away

2535
02:44:09.08 --> 02:44:15.48
Here's another little section that I think people should hear. I have a way I have way more stress and uncertainty in my life today

2536
02:44:15.48 --> 02:44:22.44
than I ever did in the seal teams or when I was suicidal the differences that I now have a new resiliency portfolio of people

2537
02:44:22.60 --> 02:44:27.32
Tools and skills that allows me to effectively manage stress almost effortlessly

2538
02:44:27.80 --> 02:44:30.20
While I do have bad days and very bad days

2539
02:44:30.60 --> 02:44:34.20
They don't control me or impact my outlook on life

2540
02:44:35.32 --> 02:44:40.68
I'm also keenly aware that most of my troubles are self-inflicted

2541
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:45.32
If you're honest with yourself you may find the same is true in your own life

2542
02:44:45.72 --> 02:44:51.000
Diversity is either a privilege or a tragedy depending on how you respond to it

2543
02:44:51.80 --> 02:44:57.000
Choosing to be a victim of the events and circumstances in my life would have been the real tragedy

2544
02:44:58.04 --> 02:45:06.12
What if we all view diverse adversity as an opportunity for personal growth to define our life's purpose and to help others?

2545
02:45:06.36 --> 02:45:08.36
The reality is that we can

2546
02:45:08.36 --> 02:45:15.80
But we can't do any of these things as victims. If I am to evolve which is my life's mission I can't be a victim

2547
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:20.12
Even if my problems are the result of someone else's actions

2548
02:45:20.12 --> 02:45:25.80
I've found it easier to find myself than to rely on the perpetrator to repair the damage

2549
02:45:27.16 --> 02:45:28.52
Well, that's what a lot of victims do

2550
02:45:29.64 --> 02:45:35.64
You're a victim because you're blaming somebody else and you're expecting them to fix it and there's just nobody's coming

2551
02:45:35.64 --> 02:45:41.56
You know, they're not going to fix it. Yeah, see what it's about just take the blame take take the ownership and solve the problem

2552
02:45:45.32 --> 02:45:52.20
After everything that I've come through I'm grateful. I think that the gratitude and service are I think that gratitude and service are unspeparable

2553
02:45:53.16 --> 02:46:00.04
The more I serve the more grateful I feel that I can still serve and care for my family my warrior brothers and sisters and continue to be

2554
02:46:00.04 --> 02:46:06.36
have serviced to all of you these days. I spend my free time hunting for perfect surf and spending time with great friends

2555
02:46:06.76 --> 02:46:11.24
I set up a non-profit to help shorten the distance to recovery from trauma and depression

2556
02:46:12.52 --> 02:46:15.88
We join with people who truly want to help themselves

2557
02:46:16.84 --> 02:46:22.04
We offer these adventurous souls a community of the right relationships and a portfolio of

2558
02:46:22.04 --> 02:46:24.52
Resiliency skills and tools

2559
02:46:24.52 --> 02:46:31.08
And what's the name of that? It's a little bit of forward thinking I'm just on the overall right now

2560
02:46:31.08 --> 02:46:34.36
I was putting in the paperwork. It's called warrior tribe and

2561
02:46:35.56 --> 02:46:40.76
The focus is going to be full trauma metal on this and I want to get into

2562
02:46:42.60 --> 02:46:44.60
Atrescuth

2563
02:46:45.64 --> 02:46:49.08
For you can awesome man the kids that were like me that are one decision away from

2564
02:46:49.08 --> 02:46:58.28
Winding up in the federal prison system. Yeah, or winding up on a great career in the military or some other path

2565
02:46:58.28 --> 02:47:00.28
You know takes one decision

2566
02:47:01.48 --> 02:47:03.48
I got lucky, you know

2567
02:47:05.08 --> 02:47:07.08
You know what

2568
02:47:07.72 --> 02:47:10.92
I just want to close it out with what you close this book out with

2569
02:47:12.76 --> 02:47:14.76
Joseph Clark Schwedler

2570
02:47:16.12 --> 02:47:18.12
It comes in waves now and again

2571
02:47:18.12 --> 02:47:22.68
There's an overwhelming feeling of disbelief that gives away to frustration

2572
02:47:23.72 --> 02:47:25.72
Then my eyes usually well up

2573
02:47:26.92 --> 02:47:31.000
It's been going on for years now. I've lost so many people it takes a toll

2574
02:47:33.64 --> 02:47:36.68
Clark was the kind of man you want your son to grow up to be

2575
02:47:38.76 --> 02:47:44.28
He was smart driven had a great sense of humor was tough but thoughtful and responsible

2576
02:47:44.28 --> 02:47:51.24
He was a born leader and he made us all better people after missions we'd be tired

2577
02:47:51.24 --> 02:47:54.04
But Clark he would be working out so we'd work out too

2578
02:47:55.64 --> 02:48:02.04
He was like a Swiss army knife. He was our navigator our intel collections guy a team leader sensitive

2579
02:48:02.04 --> 02:48:07.000
Sight exploitation officer and one of our Iraqi army combat advisors

2580
02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:10.44
He picked up everything fast and became great at whatever he did

2581
02:48:10.44 --> 02:48:15.32
Clark's dream was to be an AV seal

2582
02:48:16.52 --> 02:48:21.48
He was a Midwestern kid from crystal falls on northern Michigan town of

2583
02:48:22.20 --> 02:48:24.20
1,469 people

2584
02:48:25.96 --> 02:48:30.44
He was a senior class president played high school football and basketball and ran track

2585
02:48:34.28 --> 02:48:38.44
He did two years at Michigan state and joined the rowing team knowing Clarky

2586
02:48:38.44 --> 02:48:42.44
He did it because the workouts were grueling and he wanted to stay in shape

2587
02:48:44.84 --> 02:48:47.08
He followed his heart abandoned college

2588
02:48:49.64 --> 02:48:53.16
And enlisted in the Navy to fulfill his dream of becoming a seal

2589
02:48:58.60 --> 02:49:02.20
Clarky got to live his dream and did what he loved to do

2590
02:49:02.20 --> 02:49:05.96
Every time I saw him he had a smile on his face

2591
02:49:10.44 --> 02:49:15.32
What gives me peace is knowing that if I died doing my job as a seal I would have no regrets

2592
02:49:16.68 --> 02:49:18.68
And I know Clarky felt the same way

2593
02:49:23.56 --> 02:49:28.52
For those of us who have lost friends and family members in this war the losses connect us

2594
02:49:28.52 --> 02:49:33.88
While we may be strangers we know each other well

2595
02:49:36.60 --> 02:49:40.04
There is a surprising comfort in being together in this painful club

2596
02:49:40.44 --> 02:49:44.68
We don't have words to describe the depth of our grief, but we don't need them

2597
02:49:46.36 --> 02:49:48.36
Because we can feel each other sorrow

2598
02:49:48.36 --> 02:49:55.56
There's a saying time heals all wounds

2599
02:49:59.08 --> 02:49:59.72
It doesn't

2600
02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.32
It only makes them slightly less painful

2601
02:50:10.12 --> 02:50:13.000
I may again meet up with Clarky on the other side of this life

2602
02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.72
I'm looking forward to it

2603
02:50:28.20 --> 02:50:30.20
You know a lot knowing

2604
02:50:34.92 --> 02:50:37.72
They just put some new stars and paws on the

2605
02:50:37.72 --> 02:50:43.48
They could worry and virgin in each I didn't even know about the dogs at past

2606
02:50:49.16 --> 02:50:51.16
I think one of them was a suicide

2607
02:50:52.52 --> 02:50:54.52
died by suicide

2608
02:50:59.88 --> 02:51:03.08
Terrible place to be but since I've been there I know I can't get there again

2609
02:51:03.08 --> 02:51:09.64
And that was one phone call from one person that stopped me so

2610
02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Almost didn't answer that phone

2611
02:51:15.88 --> 02:51:18.36
Yeah, and I think homobviously the less in there is

2612
02:51:19.88 --> 02:51:24.04
Well, it messes a lot of people up the secondary tertiary effects

2613
02:51:24.04 --> 02:51:32.68
I told our nutritionists about it. You helped me out with the guys that I was assigned to

2614
02:51:34.44 --> 02:51:38.36
Told her what I'd almost done and she was like do you know how many people that would hurt?

2615
02:51:39.32 --> 02:51:40.52
I never considered that

2616
02:51:41.80 --> 02:51:44.68
I thought I was doing people a favor. That's how rational I was

2617
02:51:47.56 --> 02:51:51.56
But I've been around families where there's been a death by suicide and it

2618
02:51:51.56 --> 02:51:55.000
It's terrible what it does to the people that are left behind

2619
02:51:57.32 --> 02:51:59.32
It's

2620
02:52:02.04 --> 02:52:04.04
They don't recover from it

2621
02:52:06.68 --> 02:52:12.60
Well, you know, this this kind of tribute that you wrote there in the end to Clark

2622
02:52:14.12 --> 02:52:20.44
It's awesome, but you know from my perspective there's there's no more powerful tribute than you can make then

2623
02:52:20.44 --> 02:52:23.96
Then doing what you're doing right now, you know trying to help other people out

2624
02:52:25.96 --> 02:52:30.52
Trying to live a good life take carry family and and really

2625
02:52:32.68 --> 02:52:37.96
Sharing all the things that you've been through and how you made it through them

2626
02:52:38.92 --> 02:52:44.68
with other people and I think there's nothing better that you could do to truly on reclarks

2627
02:52:44.68 --> 02:52:54.12
His sacrifice and I do want to make it clear to it. I am still seeking a continuum of care

2628
02:52:56.12 --> 02:53:02.52
I'm recently looking at a program called Sabah warrior which hand-fold guys have gone to

2629
02:53:05.08 --> 02:53:07.80
The last three years of my life probably be a lot better book

2630
02:53:08.76 --> 02:53:12.84
This stuff that I've been dealing with is last three years and the fact that I'm able to manage it

2631
02:53:12.84 --> 02:53:16.12
is is pretty incredible to me, but

2632
02:53:18.68 --> 02:53:23.24
I don't know I think some people think oh I've had my eyes handed me up into this point nothing else is going to happen

2633
02:53:23.80 --> 02:53:30.92
I mean shit still going to happen and I've just been able to get to the point where

2634
02:53:32.36 --> 02:53:36.68
No matter how bad I got my eyes handed to me I somehow fixed it or somebody helped me fixed it and

2635
02:53:36.68 --> 02:53:42.28
I just had that mindset now. I don't care if the rest of you turn into zombies. I'll figure it out what it happens

2636
02:53:43.48 --> 02:53:48.52
But your point you're pointing saying that you're still you still are on the path of

2637
02:53:49.08 --> 02:53:52.60
You still know you need help now. Yeah, I think everybody does

2638
02:53:54.52 --> 02:53:59.000
There was a point in my life when I would have said now I'm fine, but there's always room for improvement

2639
02:54:00.76 --> 02:54:02.76
That's an easy way for someone

2640
02:54:02.76 --> 02:54:09.48
You say you don't have to say you need help, right? It's room for improvement. Yeah, that's a that's a better of team guy way of saying it

2641
02:54:09.72 --> 02:54:14.84
Because a team guy never wants to say I need some help, but if you say to a team guy don't you want to get don't you want to improve?

2642
02:54:16.04 --> 02:54:21.72
99% of team guys say hell yeah, I want to improve and another thing with that to it takes you while to get to a bad state

2643
02:54:22.28 --> 02:54:28.12
You know that one week program's not going to do it a continuum of care and that's working out good diet

2644
02:54:28.12 --> 02:54:32.76
You know taking care of the things that that lower the stress hormones

2645
02:54:33.96 --> 02:54:37.08
It's it's not just one thing. It's it's a lifestyle change

2646
02:54:37.96 --> 02:54:41.24
You can't expect to be well if you're taking down a fifth every day

2647
02:54:42.20 --> 02:54:44.60
And I'm not going to be a hit for create. I probably drink too much beer

2648
02:54:45.56 --> 02:54:47.08
But

2649
02:54:47.32 --> 02:54:51.16
But I also take in all the nutrients and vitamins and I need to be for a drink too much beer

2650
02:54:51.16 --> 02:54:53.16
Oh

2651
02:54:56.36 --> 02:54:59.40
Well, hey man look we've been going at it over three hours right now

2652
02:55:01.40 --> 02:55:09.000
Where can people people can find you Instagram? Yeah, my Instagram handle is Mike day 53 26

2653
02:55:10.20 --> 02:55:15.64
My social media is a train wreck until I hire somebody. I don't know what I'm doing and my website

2654
02:55:15.64 --> 02:55:18.76
I have a website my daughter who's my GI bill to get a

2655
02:55:18.76 --> 02:55:25.32
Graphic design degree did my website is perfectly wounded.com. Okay, so that's where people can find you

2656
02:55:28.04 --> 02:55:30.04
Any other any other closing thoughts

2657
02:55:31.32 --> 02:55:33.32
No, I just

2658
02:55:33.32 --> 02:55:35.32
There is no easy button nobody's coming

2659
02:55:36.52 --> 02:55:39.48
Nobody's gonna take care of you better than you can take care of yourself

2660
02:55:39.48 --> 02:55:48.84
It's they're I can't say enough. There's not an easy button you train yourself to get yourself to a certain point

2661
02:55:48.84 --> 02:55:54.92
That's your mindset that's training and you just look at it like that if you can train into a bad mindset you can train out

2662
02:55:56.28 --> 02:55:57.88
And

2663
02:55:57.88 --> 02:56:00.52
And if you are hanging out with a bunch of depressed people or people

2664
02:56:01.16 --> 02:56:04.52
That are like minded that that are negative you're gonna catch it

2665
02:56:04.52 --> 02:56:11.000
I mean we used to kill that stuff in the sealed teams there's always want that one guy that bitch didn't complain about everything

2666
02:56:11.24 --> 02:56:16.68
And if you didn't stop it then his buddy started bitchening complain and then it was like a damn disease

2667
02:56:19.88 --> 02:56:24.04
The negative thoughts and negative actions are not gonna fix and

2668
02:56:26.20 --> 02:56:28.84
I'll fit the jackdainals everyday doesn't fix it

2669
02:56:30.28 --> 02:56:32.28
You eventually you're not to still deal with it

2670
02:56:32.28 --> 02:56:34.28
fff

2671
02:56:34.28 --> 02:56:38.28
Right all man those are little freaking good good guidance right there and

2672
02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Man thanks for sitting down here. Thanks for talking with a thanks for coming all the way out here

2673
02:56:44.36 --> 02:56:48.36
Thanks for thanks for everything you did for the teams and for the navy and for America and

2674
02:56:49.16 --> 02:56:51.16
Man the example you set for

2675
02:56:52.12 --> 02:56:53.40
You know

2676
02:56:53.40 --> 02:56:58.76
For people not not just for what you did in the teams but like the example you're setting right now being

2677
02:56:58.76 --> 02:57:01.96
Put yourself out there explaining how to overcome things

2678
02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.72
It's freaking awesome man. I appreciate it. I don't like giving advice. I'll try to live by example

2679
02:57:07.72 --> 02:57:11.24
You know, it was came back from black rifle those those people

2680
02:57:12.68 --> 02:57:13.72
Yep

2681
02:57:13.72 --> 02:57:16.20
MPTs still going through surgeries and

2682
02:57:16.92 --> 02:57:22.36
Their lives are so much harder just to get up at a bed, you know a paraplegic and what a pain of the butt that is but they

2683
02:57:22.92 --> 02:57:26.20
They still fight through it and they were living by example

2684
02:57:26.20 --> 02:57:31.08
And when I was at the care collection it did kind of help me for a long time

2685
02:57:31.08 --> 02:57:35.96
I could I complain when you know Dan can ask and say the bulk double above the NPD

2686
02:57:36.60 --> 02:57:40.04
Taylor morse is a quad a help and I'm never seen the guy be upset

2687
02:57:43.40 --> 02:57:48.44
So it is it is inspiring to see people that we assume have a worse deal

2688
02:57:48.44 --> 02:57:55.80
Which is a hard thing for people to get across to like I don't have the right to feel this way because that guys worse for that girls worse

2689
02:57:56.36 --> 02:57:59.56
Which is not true. You know everybody's issues are there issues and

2690
02:58:00.68 --> 02:58:03.08
They have to be addressed even though you don't have

2691
02:58:03.72 --> 02:58:05.08
The worst deal

2692
02:58:05.08 --> 02:58:08.28
You know be happy you don't have the worst deal. You don't have to fix that one

2693
02:58:08.60 --> 02:58:11.56
Yeah, you might not have the worst deal, but it's your deal and you got to deal with it

2694
02:58:13.24 --> 02:58:14.28
Awesome man

2695
02:58:14.28 --> 02:58:15.64
Appreciate it brother. Thanks guys

2696
02:58:15.64 --> 02:58:18.92
And with that

2697
02:58:20.20 --> 02:58:22.60
Mike Day has left the building

2698
02:58:24.28 --> 02:58:31.08
Awesome to see him and that ends up being yet another excuse removal podcast

2699
02:58:32.44 --> 02:58:34.44
What does that mean meaning

2700
02:58:35.80 --> 02:58:42.28
It's kind of hard to make excuses when you're get done talking about like that. Who's been through a lot

2701
02:58:42.28 --> 02:58:45.08
And he's not making excuses so

2702
02:58:46.52 --> 02:58:49.48
Well echo Charles yeah, yeah, that's uh

2703
02:58:50.28 --> 02:58:54.60
It's almost like you can kind of just refer to that every single time

2704
02:58:54.60 --> 02:58:59.64
You know something's going wrong for you and probably others too. We be like well at least I didn't get shot 27 times

2705
02:58:59.64 --> 02:59:02.60
You know true statement my thumb almost ripped off

2706
02:59:03.32 --> 02:59:08.28
Yeah, it's weird you can keep or that he can keep his head straight when he looks down and be like oh

2707
02:59:08.28 --> 02:59:10.76
Yeah, my thumbs almost off as well, you know

2708
02:59:10.76 --> 02:59:18.12
Yeah, I said this I said team guy mode. Yeah, and I don't use that term lightly, but just from reading it and

2709
02:59:18.92 --> 02:59:22.76
Talk new about it. He was in full team guy mode, which is when you're just like on it

2710
02:59:22.76 --> 02:59:25.56
I'm gonna make things happen right now. Just yeah, so

2711
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:28.68
Yeah, what we did well

2712
02:59:30.20 --> 02:59:34.92
Speaking of excuse removal what do you think we can do to help

2713
02:59:34.92 --> 02:59:44.04
ourselves and each other removes and excuses and stay on the path stay capable. I think stay capable

2714
02:59:44.60 --> 02:59:49.88
Of course you're not gonna well we all have our challenges right like how you guys were saying

2715
02:59:50.44 --> 02:59:52.44
uh

2716
02:59:52.44 --> 02:59:56.76
Like people's challenges are more or lesser whatever, but there are

2717
02:59:57.72 --> 03:00:02.04
We have like that's what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but there might challenge is or our challenges anyway

2718
03:00:02.04 --> 03:00:06.36
So we're all gonna have our challenges, but we want to stay capable. Yeah, I think so

2719
03:00:07.08 --> 03:00:09.08
With capability comes

2720
03:00:10.20 --> 03:00:15.08
Exercise I think well you heard you heard Mike mentioned about a thousand times of working out

2721
03:00:15.48 --> 03:00:21.72
Right staying in shape eating good food eating good food supplementation supplementation is a thing

2722
03:00:22.52 --> 03:00:26.36
Very helpful thing anyway, so yeah supplementation jockel has fuel

2723
03:00:26.36 --> 03:00:32.52
By what is supplementation jockel fuel so what kind of supplementation for your joints is a big one

2724
03:00:32.92 --> 03:00:38.12
Keep your joints in the game my kids saw a guy do a backflip. It was a big muscle guy

2725
03:00:39.16 --> 03:00:42.60
And he was doing a bunch of other stuff and there was a kid involved in the video and

2726
03:00:44.12 --> 03:00:47.48
He was doing so and my daughter, you know she's curious she's seven so

2727
03:00:48.20 --> 03:00:50.92
Everything the guy did she was like hey dad, can you do that?

2728
03:00:50.92 --> 03:00:58.44
Mm-hmm and the answer was yes every single time she would be like hey prove it so I'd have to like prove it, you know and there was like a rope in it too

2729
03:00:58.44 --> 03:01:01.72
So we I didn't have to prove that part of it and he she was like

2730
03:01:02.60 --> 03:01:04.60
He was doing like a bunch of stuff and I was like

2731
03:01:05.40 --> 03:01:10.68
It was the list was going on and on and I was like I was doing good at first but after while I started to get nervous like

2732
03:01:10.68 --> 03:01:16.04
Bro this guy is pretty starting to get out side of your realm of capabilities. It looked like he was about to you know

2733
03:01:16.04 --> 03:01:21.80
Cuz he just kept doing stuff and I looked at him. I was like using good shape one of those athletic shapes too

2734
03:01:21.88 --> 03:01:26.60
muscle guy. I'm like okay, all right, all right, and then finally the last thing he did was this backflip

2735
03:01:26.60 --> 03:01:30.04
Sort of the finale of the video like saying thanks for watching and he does a backflip

2736
03:01:31.96 --> 03:01:34.92
And I remember back in the day I could do a backflip straight up

2737
03:01:35.16 --> 03:01:37.86
What do you call it a tuck? I think it's called you know the kind of you

2738
03:01:37.86 --> 03:01:39.86
Absolutely yeah, so

2739
03:01:39.86 --> 03:01:45.62
But I'm like oh man if I were to bust out about backflip right now because of course you want to see right now

2740
03:01:45.62 --> 03:01:47.62
I'd probably hurt myself

2741
03:01:48.66 --> 03:01:52.18
But if I warmed up a little bit, I think I could do it right now

2742
03:01:52.18 --> 03:01:55.78
I'm spreadsheet you can go for it at the pool's edge and say hey listen, P

2743
03:01:55.78 --> 03:02:02.70
I can do it but I'm gonna do it over here by the pool just if because I'm cold right now

2744
03:02:02.70 --> 03:02:04.94
See this guy warms up a lot. Yeah, that's all right

2745
03:02:04.94 --> 03:02:08.26
That's actually what I said. It was like, yeah, he's warming up. Of course. You know, she's like okay

2746
03:02:08.26 --> 03:02:11.62
So now everyone's gonna all show me like hey, just warm up do it before your workout

2747
03:02:11.62 --> 03:02:16.26
You know like I got a bus I'll take excuse. It's been about 10 years since I did it

2748
03:02:17.46 --> 03:02:22.62
And you can get hurt if you don't do it correctly. So the last thing I need is for me to double down and get

2749
03:02:23.14 --> 03:02:26.74
injured in front of my daughter, you know kind of blow her whole image of me

2750
03:02:26.74 --> 03:02:31.62
But she knows I can do it in the pool. Sure already knows that because I don't think I could get away from the pool thing on the less

2751
03:02:33.06 --> 03:02:37.10
If I practice when she's not looking like in the pool or whatever, I'll pull it off

2752
03:02:37.10 --> 03:02:39.98
But here's the thing I'm a little bit older now

2753
03:02:41.14 --> 03:02:43.14
So my joints

2754
03:02:43.94 --> 03:02:51.94
Could take a beating if I wasn't on that supplementation this one of the things I was thinking about as I'm explaining it to her like I could pull it off

2755
03:02:51.94 --> 03:02:53.58
Just need to up your joint warfare

2756
03:02:53.58 --> 03:02:58.78
Just I might have to you know just to first sit, you know for safety sake as it was

2757
03:02:59.06 --> 03:03:03.46
Nonetheless, yeah, so take the joint warfare just in case somebody else you do a back flip for sure

2758
03:03:03.46 --> 03:03:09.82
Talk whatever should not inside the pool or other things. Let's let's face each right a climber rope or something like this

2759
03:03:09.82 --> 03:03:15.30
You should all just get hurt, but if you join so good you're good also krill oil super krill oil

2760
03:03:16.50 --> 03:03:20.26
And also that vitamin D yeah get on that vitamin D

2761
03:03:21.14 --> 03:03:23.14
Makes a little vitamin D with your cold war

2762
03:03:24.42 --> 03:03:30.38
immunity system strong. Yeah, boost the immune system also milk. Yeah, I was gonna say don't forget about

2763
03:03:30.38 --> 03:03:32.94
Discipline discipline go a

2764
03:03:33.26 --> 03:03:37.42
Discipline powder we've got all kind of discipline. Yeah, a little bit of that

2765
03:03:38.58 --> 03:03:40.58
When you need that little

2766
03:03:41.90 --> 03:03:50.70
Accelerant yeah to kind of ignite things try it out. You might like it. Yeah, and the and the the juggle Palmer both

2767
03:03:51.26 --> 03:03:52.54
Powder and the

2768
03:03:52.54 --> 03:04:00.20
Can't I think sort of the leading flavor? It was the tropic one, but I think yeah, I think that kind of it's set in stone

2769
03:04:00.20 --> 03:04:03.48
I think in my sour apple apple sniper

2770
03:04:04.76 --> 03:04:08.94
Out right now by the way jade nails custom signature

2771
03:04:09.56 --> 03:04:11.56
Jp Nell signature line

2772
03:04:13.52 --> 03:04:17.80
What doesn't good deal. It's good too. I've tried you know, I try obviously I tried the

2773
03:04:18.80 --> 03:04:23.56
sour apple sniper and it's really good. Yeah, it's gonna it's really good

2774
03:04:23.64 --> 03:04:28.000
It's really good and yes, they've burq good deal. Yes

2775
03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:38.52
He also has a flavor coming a signature flavor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, those are interesting too because you get this is the orange afterburner orange

2776
03:04:40.96 --> 03:04:42.56
You um

2777
03:04:42.56 --> 03:04:47.28
These energy drinks the RTD cans you kind of and I kind of forget this from time to time

2778
03:04:47.28 --> 03:04:53.56
Two, I'm like okay, I need energy drink, but it's not just the energy drink you get the discipline and you don't get like for real chemicals

2779
03:04:53.56 --> 03:04:55.56
Yeah, yeah, you don't that's that's so yeah

2780
03:04:55.56 --> 03:05:02.10
There's no sugar in it. It's sweet with monk fruit still tastes good and but what's even next level is that it's pasteurized

2781
03:05:02.10 --> 03:05:05.16
So there's no chemicals that keep things stable

2782
03:05:05.32 --> 03:05:09.68
Which we had to go through a long period of of

2783
03:05:11.88 --> 03:05:19.28
Testing and to find the place and to make this drink the way it is. So yeah check that out. Yeah, it's like a

2784
03:05:19.28 --> 03:05:23.92
Um it'd be a disservice to call it a health drink

2785
03:05:24.68 --> 03:05:27.64
Even though it essentially is a health drink

2786
03:05:27.64 --> 03:05:35.08
You know what I'm starting to feel over here is that when we do a podcast like this where you don't say much during that podcast portion

2787
03:05:35.64 --> 03:05:43.04
Maybe that sort of build some pent-up conversation where where you want to converse with you about stuff

2788
03:05:43.04 --> 03:05:48.36
Oh, that yeah, and it seemed like you had plotted out a whole kind of topic here that we were gonna go into

2789
03:05:48.36 --> 03:05:54.64
Yeah, you are gonna go right you know I feel it too, but and you know now that you mentioned that you're right

2790
03:05:54.64 --> 03:05:57.36
You're actually yeah in real life you're right and here's what's crazy

2791
03:05:57.52 --> 03:06:01.30
That's a long podcast. That's the challenge right? So I'm thinking okay cool

2792
03:06:01.30 --> 03:06:04.62
Just in the front of our podcast and I'm like echo, you know

2793
03:06:04.62 --> 03:06:07.12
We'll just kind of burn through people kind of know what's up

2794
03:06:07.12 --> 03:06:09.02
They want to support the podcast. They're gonna get the game

2795
03:06:09.02 --> 03:06:11.62
They know what to go to origin main.com. We can just kind of let them know

2796
03:06:11.62 --> 03:06:13.92
But then we're talking about backfix

2797
03:06:14.44 --> 03:06:16.44
That's what we're talking about

2798
03:06:16.44 --> 03:06:20.10
Bro, you know how like okay, I see then what I do is I screw up isn't that I bring it up

2799
03:06:20.10 --> 03:06:23.48
I should just keep my mouth shut be like up backflips cool. Yeah

2800
03:06:23.98 --> 03:06:29.98
RTD up good where your kid moke get it yep, yeah, but I don't I think I

2801
03:06:30.68 --> 03:06:36.60
Take the bait. I take the bait. It's kind of bait because 100% bait. Well, okay, so we're all at home

2802
03:06:36.60 --> 03:06:40.64
You know a lot of us. I mean, you know some some of sort of going out a little bit more than others

2803
03:06:40.64 --> 03:06:42.80
But like I'm one of the people I'm at home a lot

2804
03:06:42.80 --> 03:06:48.44
So I take I talk to the same four people in my family varying levels of age. Okay, you know in maturity levels

2805
03:06:48.52 --> 03:06:52.16
So after while it gets repetitive so when I see you, you know once a week

2806
03:06:52.16 --> 03:06:58.76
I'm like hey man, let's do this talk. Let's face it and that's not that's a common thing like because sometimes we can go straight up two hours before we've been

2807
03:06:58.76 --> 03:07:02.68
Pressure cord because we're you know whatever whatever and when you think about it

2808
03:07:02.68 --> 03:07:08.36
I'm just realizing this just now like we kind of rolled in where you like kind of all business. Yeah, so you're correct. You know like that

2809
03:07:08.36 --> 03:07:10.36
you've got a whole sort of like

2810
03:07:10.36 --> 03:07:13.84
Excessive conversations floating in the air had to just

2811
03:07:13.84 --> 03:07:16.56
Yeah, I've done all in the camera here with a zero

2812
03:07:16.56 --> 03:07:20.40
I'd be just as soon like read off the stuff you tell where to go and we leave

2813
03:07:20.40 --> 03:07:26.68
I'd be down with that. I understand. Okay. All right. Well, hey, let's beat it up, but hey, let's you know bear with me if you will

2814
03:07:26.68 --> 03:07:28.04
So yes

2815
03:07:28.04 --> 03:07:35.68
Discipline can powder all that good for your brain good for your body keep it keeping keep yourself on the path and capable by the way

2816
03:07:35.68 --> 03:07:41.000
Mulk extra protein in the form of a dessert eating dessert like what ice cream or

2817
03:07:42.92 --> 03:07:48.52
Snickers bars for dessert. I guess that's not really a dessert. That's my candy bar, but like a cake a bun to cake

2818
03:07:48.96 --> 03:07:52.12
But don't do that. That'll take you up the path. Yeah

2819
03:07:53.08 --> 03:07:58.32

2829
03:08:39.16 --> 03:08:41.76
This is you've kind of thrown it in the end like it's no big deal

2830
03:08:42.20 --> 03:08:46.48
Everything that I just said is 100% made in America without compromise

2831
03:08:46.48 --> 03:08:52.96
You're supporting America you're supporting local people that are making things happen our people
