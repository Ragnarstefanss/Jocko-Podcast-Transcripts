00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 273 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I was with the Turks and we were heading south. The Chinese had entered the war a few days before.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They had kicked the ass of the entire 8th Army and we were on the run.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We had descended a spur of the ridge and we're crossing the valley when we came to a village.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Everywhere you looked were the corpses of slaughtered Americans.

6
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
One, a captain of infantry, I had met back and forth Lewis, was strung up by the wrists between two buildings.

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
His feet not quite touching the ground.

8
00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He raised his head slightly and his lips trembled as he tried to speak. His strength lay in a pool of frozen blood beneath his feet.

9
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I leaned my rifle against the wall and reached up to cut the ropes.

10
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Water, he breathed softly, then coughed once the air gurgling through the blood and his throat.

11
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'd heard it before from the coal miners back in Hermione.

12
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They made no difference whether I cut him down or not. He was dead.

13
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
His chin sank to his chest and he swayed lightly.

14
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Like the thin frail branches of the willow trees next to the cemetery back home.

15
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The men captured with him were hanging too.

16
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Some between branches, some endureways, one between two thick limbs of an ancient apple tree.

17
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They had all been butchered the same way, stripped, then strung up like Christ on the cross.

18
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Their stomachs had been sliced open and their guts pulled out to dangle down before them.

19
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Blood, flesh, and guts were trampled in the snow everywhere.

20
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The Turks glided silently from body to body, cutting each down and laying it to rest.

21
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000
A bright Korean moon etched in silver, the horror of the scene.

22
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I can hardly remember if time when I didn't want to be in the service.

23
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Both my brothers were in.

24
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Bud was a chief torpedo man. In the north Atlantic, Chuck, the oldest, was an infantry company commander in Europe.

25
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Bud was the more colorful storyteller.

26
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And the navy would have been my choice hands down, except for Hollywood.

27
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Artillery, barrages, hand-to-hand combat, paratroopers, the jungles, arrow-flin in Burma, that was war.

28
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I was born to be an infantryman.

29
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that right there is the opening of a book called The Making of a Soldier.

30
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
By Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Herbert.

31
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And this is an incredible book and I've been referencing it here and there as I've been reading it for the last few months.

32
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And it's actually two books. There's actually two books.

33
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
One is the book I was just reading from called The Making of a Soldier.

34
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The other is simply called Soldier, both written by Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Tony Herbert.

35
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I first heard of these books a few months ago. I'd never heard of them before.

36
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I spoke to the cadets at West Point.

37
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And the Colonel that hosted me by the name of Colonel Pat Howell.

38
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
He's the director of the Modern War Institute at West Point.

39
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And after this event, he emailed me.

40
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And during the event I had mentioned about face and hackworth while I was talking to the cadets.

41
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And Colonel Howell sent me a photograph in this email.

42
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And this photograph that he sent was a photograph of his copy of about face.

43
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And it was actually signed by Colonel Hackworth.

44
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the inscription said to Patrick,

45
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You come from a long line of great warriors who led by that adage of looking after your men.

46
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Warmist regards Hack.

47
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And it turned out that Hackworth had worked for Colonel Howell's grandfather in the army.

48
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And so Colonel Howell sent me a message.

49
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
An image of another book. And the book that he sent me, the image of his called soldier.

50
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And Colonel Howell said this in the email.

51
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
He said, speaking of Dave Hackworth, I sent a pick of his autograph of my copy.

52
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
He had worked for my grandfather years previously.

53
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I've also sent a picture of a very hackworth-like story about a guy named Tony Herbert.

54
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The book is called Soldier.

55
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
He also was enlisted in the Korean War, got commissioned, and then was a batained commander in Vietnam.

56
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And had a prickly time with his chain of command.

57
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
He also worked for my grandfather back in Germany circa 1960.

58
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, I mean, I get that report right there.

59
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's all I need to hear.

60
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I hunt down these books online.

61
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
These two books, one soldier, and then the other one, the making of a soldier.

62
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I ordered them both.

63
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And it's to me, okay, well great.

64
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I got another warrior that I can try and learn from, pretty straightforward.

65
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But I should have paid more attention to the statement.

66
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That Herbert, that this guy Colonel Herbert had,

67
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
quote, had a prickly time with his chain of command in Vietnam.

68
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This is actually a pretty significant understatement.

69
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And it makes this whole story, and the lessons learned.

70
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Just not quite a straightforward.

71
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
A lot of controversy.

72
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And the whole story, which is a combined about a 600 pages of reading between the two books,

73
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
as I tried, as I read these books, and this way this story comes out.

74
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It's a pretty big elephant to try and swallow.

75
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I wasn't quite sure how to approach the whole thing for the podcast.

76
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I read the books, and then I'm just kind of stewing on them.

77
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Because there's the whole thing.

78
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
There's war crimes, and there's accusations, and counter accusations,

79
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and there's good leadership, and there's bad leadership, and it's all wrapped up around this story.

80
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
If one of the most highly decorated soldiers from the Korean War,

81
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
a man that you're going to see how often this guy's wounded over and over again,

82
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:57.000
blown up hit with white phosphorus, shot, and bayoneted multiple times.

83
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So you have this completely heroic individual that is definitely a hack worth type leader,

84
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and you see these heroic tendencies eventually get caught up and put through the ringer of politics,

85
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and ego, and the bureaucratic machine.

86
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And it just really makes it a complex story.

87
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And as I read the book, there was less and after less and what to do,

88
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and what not to do, and what to watch out for.

89
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And like I said, because the vast range of this story is hard for me to wrap my head around it and present it,

90
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and figure out how to present it.

91
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And luckily, I have a standard operating procedure of what to do when I'm facing a tough task.

92
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
What you do is you put your rock on and you start marching.

93
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And that's what we're going to do here, the life and times of Colonel Anthony Tony Herbert.

94
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And I'm going to utilize both these books, they kind of bounce back and forth,

95
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to get some background on Herbert's life to start with.

96
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We're going to go to his second book, which is called Soldier.

97
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Here we go.

98
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Both my brothers were born well before me, Charles 15 years earlier in Jules Paul 11,

99
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
almost a different generation, a fact of life for which I never really forgave them.

100
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Because when World War II came along, they both packed up and marched off,

101
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
leaving me standing on the front porch, cursing the irrevocable fact that in 1941,

102
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in America there wasn't a great demand for 10-year-old fighting men.

103
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I cried too when they left, not because they were going to war and might not come back,

104
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but because I couldn't go with them.

105
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
My mother tried to comfort me. The army doesn't want you now, Tony.

106
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
She said, you've just got to learn to understand, rules are rules,

107
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but I neither could nor would. All I really knew for certain was that one day above all other things,

108
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I wanted to be a soldier and that somebody or something was ruining my dream.

109
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So this guy comes out of the womb, ready to rock and roll as they say.

110
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And I'll tell you, as I get into this early life,

111
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
it's definitely a very cool description of America in this timeframe,

112
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
both prior to World War II and he's a little kid and then as he gets a little bit older,

113
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
he says, this guns were always an integral part of my life in the Herbert family.

114
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Not because we were great sportsmen or anything like that,

115
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but simply because we like to eat and eating wasn't simple,

116
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
wasn't a simple matter for a coal miner and his family in those days.

117
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
The minds were all my father had ever known.

118
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The day after day regimen of dust and dirt and darkness and penny-pinching and poverty,

119
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
with never enough pennies to pinch,

120
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
up until John L. Lewis and the United Mine Workers came along in 1939.

121
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
The most cash my father ever saw for one week's work was $2.

122
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
The rest of his compensation came in the form of credit at the Yerika store where Mr. Stalls,

123
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the manager and doodiful employee of the mine,

124
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
would carefully match the amount of purchases against the amount of credits in

125
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
inevitably worked out at the end of the year that my father and every other minor in town

126
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
had bought more than their credit allowed.

127
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
All my life, I heard my father and mother were about paying off the company store before they died.

128
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Their chief aim was to leave without passing that particular debt onto their children.

129
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
They lived in a company owned house, in a company owned town, in a company owned county.

130
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Neither my father nor any other man who worked in the mine's could quit.

131
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
How could they? The mine's owned them.

132
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But none of us ever really felt poor.

133
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
There were so many other families just like us that we had no standard of comparison.

134
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Everybody had to struggle to make it.

135
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
At least everybody with whom we had any contact.

136
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And for all we knew, the whole world lived precisely as we did, there in hermany.

137
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
40 miles from Pittsburgh deep in the black heart of coal mine country.

138
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Different kind of lifestyle.

139
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000
If my father ever complained about the grim cycles in his life, I never heard him.

140
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:53.000
He was a steady as a clock up before dawn, walked to the mine, back home in the evening for a glass of beer or two before supper,

141
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and then to bed.

142
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But with a wife and four children, Charles and Jules, my two older brothers,

143
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
plus our sister Irene, four years my senior and me, there was never enough money, never near enough.

144
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And the income from his guide service, and I skipped the head, he also like,

145
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
will guide hunters sometimes.

146
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
His income from the guide service couldn't bridge the gap.

147
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
He trapped moss grats and sold pelts to Montgomery Ward and Sears in Roebuck.

148
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And average skin would bring about a dollar 75 and exceptionally good one would sell for three dollars.

149
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And although he approached his trapping with all the same skill and determination devoted to his job at the mine and his hunting, it still wasn't enough.

150
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
There were occasions when he would have to trudged down to the welfare office.

151
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It was painful for him.

152
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I knew he dreaded every trip he had ever made down there.

153
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And when he came back with the government commodities, a bag of rice, a bag of raisins, a bag of cornmeal,

154
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
he had the look of a man who had stood in a line of men going nowhere.

155
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
He was unusually grim.

156
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And for days afterwards he would not be himself, but somehow quieter, more withdrawn.

157
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I suppose the only comfort he had was in knowing that he wasn't the only husband and father in her many who was having trouble taking care of his family.

158
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
All of us went to whatever lengths were necessary to get the job done.

159
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We made wine at home and sold or traded it for essentials. Charles took on an ice route.

160
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Delivering the 25 pound and 50 pound blocks up and down the street.

161
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We picked coal at the slate dump, a smoking mountain of coal waste deposited by the mine just at the edge of town.

162
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
It was about a quarter mile across and three quarters of a mile long.

163
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
All of the childhood images I have retained, one of the most vivid is of that Ebony heap rising above the house is steaming and hissing like a volcano.

164
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We would trudge up its crumbling sides, pick up pieces of slate knock on knock the coal off and put it in our burlap sacks that we carried.

165
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
At the end of the day we piled our sacks into a wheelbarrow and went downtown to sell the coal for a dime a sack.

166
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:20.000
The slate pile was never one of my favorite places. There were cavernous hollow pockets beneath its contours and we had all heard of the two people who had gone to the dump and disappeared forever into its black bowels.

167
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
But somehow we survived.

168
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000
The town was one of several built around the collection of mines that had attracted not only the Baltic immigrants, but a lot of scots and Irish men as well.

169
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So for Creek a bright red steam fed constantly with a drain off from the mine separated our town from Limerick Hill, the first of the others.

170
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The first of the systems that were premised on that creek was rigid as though it were the Berlin Wall. Still despite our differences, I never knew what they were.

171
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:06.000
We shared one common bond, the mines and their wailing whistles that shrieked out at the beginning and end of the workers' days, sounding for miles and miles through the hills.

172
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And sometimes signaling the reality of death.

173
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
My uncle Joe Sheerer, my mother's oldest sister's husband died in a cave in.

174
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
At the nearby barking mine when I was about four years old, three or four other miners were also killed in that cave in.

175
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And I remember the sound of the whistles.

176
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:39.000
It was always like that back then, always some accident or cave in that killed one or two or three men, not any major disaster as the newspapers like to say.

177
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So it was forgotten and ignored by those who had the kind of power that would have made some difference in the condition of the mines and the dangers faced by those who worked in them.

178
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
He goes on here, he talks about the church.

179
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And he has a father Kelly there said, I always loved father Kelly, but I was never sure about the church.

180
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He was a kind old man who'd been a hero in World War I and had the medals to prove it.

181
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
According to my father, he had been gasped.

182
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000
At times he seemed very nervous about being a priest and maybe that why he was drinking a great deal.

183
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
He talks about another guy named Dr. Latimer.

184
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And look, I'm going into some detail here because as this story unfolds, you've got to try and figure out where he's making decisions from.

185
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Where is his morality rooted? And it's very clear as you move through this that there's people that influence the way he fought.

186
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Another guy that influenced the way he fought is a guy named Dr. Latimer.

187
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And this guy was like the local doctor and he kind of got to know him a little bit.

188
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And one of the things he would do is give him copies of National Geographic.

189
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And again, this is one of those things where when you read this, you think, okay, it's when you look back.

190
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
When you see the way the whole story unfolds you look back, you think to yourself, okay, this is interesting.

191
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:18.000
He says it was Doc, I think, who first started impressing me with the idea that wherever people live, they're essentially the same.

192
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Look at these natives, he would say, pointing at some bare-breasted folks from Australia or Africa.

193
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
They hunt just like you hunt Tony and just like your father and your brothers.

194
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
The only differences that they use a bone arrow.

195
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
They bleed if they get cut.

196
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And the fathers and mothers worry about their children and they all worry about food and about dying.

197
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
And they all want to live as long as they can just like you, Tony.

198
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
The doc never went to church. Somehow that impressed me.

199
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Like my father, he seemed always to be what he was never any foniness around him or about him.

200
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So that's again, you can kind of see this guy's developing a pretty strong moral character about other people and seeing other people as people and what the common ground is.

201
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
He talks more here about father Kelly. He was a good priest.

202
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Good in the sense that he deeply knew the people in his flock. He knew their poverty and their hopelessness and their frequent desperation and above all,

203
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
he knew how absolutely necessary it was that their individual family incomes be supplemented.

204
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
That's why he showed no reservations at all about doctoring baptismal certificates.

205
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
In 1942, when I was 12 years old, he changed mind to make it read that I was 16.

206
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And thus allowed me to get a work permit and start bringing home a little cash for the family. He had done the same for my brothers I was told,

207
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
and for almost anybody else in town who had son to a willing to work.

208
00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:00.000
I'd taken my first job when I was 10, along with Richard Nadel, the brother of a pretty girl named Mary Grace.

209
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.000
We worked on Mueller's farm right outside of town and every morning at 430 rain or shine. Mr. Mueller would come into town and pick us up on his little truck.

210
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:19.000
We paid a dollar fifty a week and a gallon of raw milk. And for that, we both drove tractors cut wheat, dug potatoes, fed his cattle, milked his cows.

211
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:29.000
He knew what he was doing. Obviously that wasn't helping much with the family financial burdens and father Kelly's forgery was an absolute necessity.

212
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So he had the under the table job, but you're not getting paid very much. So he gets this doctored birth certificate.

213
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
He goes out and gets a job at this glass factory, he goes into some detail about that.

214
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
He's working in a situation where he's wearing a full ass bestest suit.

215
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And he's working in a place that's so hot, you're only allowed to work for 10 minutes and then it's 10 minutes break.

216
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And it's not like these are a lenient labor laws. It had to be so hot that you'd like die if you don't get a break.

217
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
So then he does that job for a while. He ends up with a Pennsylvania Railroad. He's making 85 cents an hour.

218
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And he's doing this job where once again, there's a 600 pound piston that's like above you and you'd never be, if it happened to fall, you were dead.

219
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Because you couldn't hear anything. And of course he liked football. He liked playing sports, but he says here, I soon learned that the practice time required for high school athletics,

220
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
8 into the time I could spend in the field with my hunting and my trapping.

221
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000
During games on Saturday, I would tie hunting dogs to the bench and stash my gun beneath it while we played.

222
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:51.000
During one of the during one of the winters in my early teens, the Calsters lost four of their children in one swift stroke of fate.

223
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And once again, the mind whistle told the story to the neighboring communities. One of the older brother Harry's Harry was a friend of mine.

224
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:13.000
His two younger brothers and two sisters were out one afternoon playing on the frog ponds in the area ponds created by the still drainage of the mines. The near zero temperatures had frozen the water to what the kids believed was a safe depth.

225
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:26.000
But the ice broke beneath them and one by one the others plunged through and drowned to trying to affect a rescue with the courage so typical of the area all for dead.

226
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I had never seen Harry cry before. I caught his eye at Stader's funeral home and his tears moved me to cry myself.

227
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Again, just the fact that he's talking about sort of this courage and if you think about what your job is, what most people's jobs are going to those mines every day.

228
00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:04.000
He talks about another body of his and doesn't really, well, he doesn't explain what happened because he didn't know what happened but somehow this kid got shot with a 22 caliber like playing around or whatever.

229
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.000
He says he lived for some months, but then gangrene said in and they brought his body back to her, her many.

230
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:28.000
The funeral said at St. Edwards where I was an altar boy that priest took the water shaker from me and began to sprinkle its contents on the casket and I remembered that I stood there before the altar trying to figure out at which end of the great metal box they'd placed Joe's head and which end his feet.

231
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I never really thought in terms of the dead as being punished. It'd always been a matter of living getting their come up and.

232
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I never picked individual fights, but I never seemed to have any trouble getting into them either.

233
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
I guess because I was larger than most of the guys my age, a lot of them couldn't resist the challenge.

234
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I don't remember ever losing one.

235
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
We get a good background with the guy. We get a good feel of the situation. It's very tough. Hard work.

236
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Always behind the eight ball financially, but still nonetheless tight community.

237
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Fast forward a little bit while I was getting started as an analyst and my brothers were fighting the war.

238
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Chuck became an infantry officer in a company commander in Italy and bud, a navy man served as chief torpedo man aboard a destroyer that prowled the North Atlantic.

239
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Their letters were never any aid or comfort to me.

240
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Vicarious combat, like books and movies and teleplays had never been my cup of tea.

241
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:56.000
I hadn't quite recovered from their abrupt departure from her many and their subsequent location in places with exotic names when they came home with medals on their chest and war stories to tell the old man on the front porch.

242
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000
In the spring of 1944, that's what I wanted and I wanted it badly. I still wanted to be a soldier and I knew exactly how I could do it.

243
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
The military's rules be damned. The phony baptismal certificate father Kelly had worked for me.

244
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Had worked up for me was the key. Actually, I was already getting some advice from people at work about registering for the draft.

245
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
They thought I was 18 years old.

246
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And I saw no reason to disappoint them. I went over to Irwin with my work permit in hand and told Mrs. Gunga where at the draft office that I just forgot about it and needed to register.

247
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
She looked at me as if I were a little bit of a bitch who was trying to sneak out of my duty as an 18 year old American citizen.

248
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Actually, I was a 14 year old teenager. American citizen, they was trying to do my best to sneak into my duty.

249
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
I'd like to say it was all my idea, but I can't remember whether it was me or my friend Tony Spazali.

250
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
So, him and Tony Spazali decide they're going to go and list.

251
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:08.000
They catch or they hit your ride until they get outside of Pittsburgh. Once they get outside of Pittsburgh, we walk the rest of the way to the US post office in downtown Pittsburgh.

252
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
We both joined the US Marines. This kid's 14.

253
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
The next day, the train Tony and I were riding southward through Virginia towards Paras Island, South Carolina.

254
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
It was halted in some backwards town and we were taken off by a man who identified himself only as a federal officer.

255
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:36.000
We were both impressed if disappointed. When we arrived back at the Pittsburgh Depot, Mr. Grestman or high school principal was waiting and took us home.

256
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000
My father only shook his head, but my mother was glad to see me and smothered me with forgiveness. I went back to my traps in my school and my job and the railroad.

257
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
The very next day, I wasn't finished, however, I was only waiting. Fast forward a little bit.

258
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Three years later, now he's actually the right age. He goes to unless he's 17 years old, goes to the Marine Corps recruiting office and gets told the quote as full.

259
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Because by the way, the war's over. The war had been over. So he missed the World War II. He turns 17, right cool.

260
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Sorry, we ain't got nothing for you. So he gets told by the Marine Corps recruiter, sorry, nothing for you.

261
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
And then at that moment, a man wearing the US Army's 11th Airborne patch on his shoulder, centered into the Marine's office and noticed my quandary.

262
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Hey, kid, you want to be a pair of troopers? He asked, what's that I inquired?

263
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
You had jumped out of planes and fight, he said, and I joined. Perry didn't a story. We got you.

264
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:41.000
A week later, in the early morning of May, 1947, I got up to say goodbye to my folks, my father who rose at 430 every morning of his life, except Sundays was sitting at the kitchen table.

265
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:51.000
When I came downstairs, already dressed and ready, leave. My mother was puttering quietly around the stove and the large white, a name will cabin it, preparing lunch for my father to take to the mine.

266
00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:02.000
I sat down and poured a cup, they'll cough into a metal cup. I suppose my father felt it was absolutely necessary that he gave me some parting advice, although he like I had no idea what being a pair of trooper meant.

267
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
But it was good advice. As I recall, it went something like this.

268
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
The uniform doesn't mean you're a soldier.

269
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Whatever you do, don't get disgusted, stick with it like you stick with it here at home. Remember what your brothers did. Nobody ever quit.

270
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000
It won't be any harder than hunting than waiting in the creek in the wintertime. Nothing is as hard as just getting started.

271
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
It's like in the coal mines every step takes care of itself. Then we walked out together.

272
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
My mother didn't cry. I wouldn't have expected her to stoicism as a virtue that a coal miner's wife develops.

273
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I never remember my mother as a young woman, not that day or any other. And when my wife is 60 years old, she will be younger than my mother was at 30.

274
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
My mother waved from the porch as my father and I descended the 20 steps to the road.

275
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:09.000
His ride to the mine came by and they disappeared into the darkness. I walked to the Eureka store, caught a buster Irwin, took a train to Pittsburgh, and then on the morning of May 10, 1947, I arrived at Fort Dix, New Jersey.

276
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:21.000
I recall that moment as among the happiest in my life. The moment I stepped off that train and knew I was on my way to my dream.

277
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I was going to be a soldier. So we kind of get an idea of what we're dealing with here.

278
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I think that's something important background to grab.

279
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And then we're going to go back to this other book. So we're going to go back to the other book that making of a soldier.

280
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And what's interesting about this is he originally wrote this book.

281
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:57.000
He originally wrote this book. So the big book, the soldier book came out in 1998, he wrote it came out in 1973 or something like that.

282
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Maybe a little bit later. But this other book, he had originally written a book called Conquest to Know Where.

283
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
It was just about his experience in Korea. And he wrote that in 1954.

284
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
And he was young when he wrote it. And he explains this in the kind of in the preface to this book. He explains he was young.

285
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000
He had a co-author, the co-author kind of ran with it a little bit more than he did.

286
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And so I ended up really not reflecting what he had been through. So he re-wrote this book later.

287
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000
So we're picking this up where he's at basic training. So in basic we were interviewed periodically for school assignments.

288
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
My choice was infantry. And I kept asking for it. I was advised each time that only an idiot would want to go infantry.

289
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:51.000
But there's no way to discourage me, although I got pretty mad at being told that a soldier who wanted to fight was crazy.

290
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
And today I was about to tell the captain in a couple of loutens just what I thought of leaders who attempted to sell men on every profession in the army.

291
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Except the one that had been created for when my friend Bob Heizi took me aside. Look herb.

292
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Don't let the bastards get to you. If you don't accept a school, they're going to have to let you go infantry.

293
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000
But frankly, I think you're nuts. He was right, not that I was nuts. But that if I held out, they would have to let me go infantry.

294
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I did and they did. So after basic, because it goes through basic training, some stories about that. And obviously I'm fast-boarding through a bunch of this stuff. You have to get these books to get the full details.

295
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
After basic, I cooled my heels for a couple of weeks with the second infantry division for Luce,

296
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I watched it into my papers were processed. Then I was sent to jump school and was graduated as an infantryman and a pair of trooper.

297
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.000
I served a year and a half was discharged and returned to finish school at Seckwitley Township High in Hermione.

298
00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:00.000
No one went anywhere in the US Army without a high school diploma, so I earned mine then reinlisted in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Brake.

299
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:17.000
For a month later, while I was studying radio repair at Fort Monmouth, the North Koreans invaded South Korea. I was shaving when my friend Harry burst into the little train with news that the United States was going to provide combat assistance to South Korea.

300
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
My head whipped around and I sliced a notch on my chin that passed for a dimple for a good two years.

301
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Harry and I talked it over, we made our decision. Then we made our pitch. We asked to be released from school early to go to Korea.

302
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
The Commanding Officer laughed. Korea explained was a zero big nothing. Our troops in Japan were quite capable of handling things over there.

303
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And he said it would all be over before our request could even be processed. He's crazy. I later insisted to Harry and can't be.

304
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I wasn't going to be cheated again. I tried to go over his head. It was useless. I tried to flunk out of the course. It was impossible.

305
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
The only way was to graduate. So I boarded down. I took my classes. I applied myself. I was going to get out.

306
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000
I was going to get out of the signal corps completely. I was going to get out of the 82nd. I was going to get out of the United States. I was going to get to Korea.

307
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And I was going to get back into infantry as an infantryman and to fight in the war.

308
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And he makes a good attempt. He makes a good attempt. He makes it happen. He graduates from the school.

309
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:35.000
And now he is on a troop transport, which takes 10 days to get to Japan. Those are the longest days of my life. On the eighth, I was assigned KP.

310
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Refused to pull it and got busted from private first class back to private. They didn't matter. I was on my way to war. And I wasn't about to arrive with dish pan hands.

311
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Besides who the hell cared whether I got there as a PFC or private. He just fell on. He was full on.

312
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:06.000
We were briefed by some of the evacuated veterans of Korea who were being used to give us the real scoop before we went in. Some of it was bullshit. Most of it was true.

313
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:14.000
A sergeant of that of both World War II and Korea told the best, whenner is coming, he informed us.

314
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Most likely you will find it more severe than any winter you have ever seen. It's high, rugged country, and bitter cold.

315
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And you'll be out there in the weather 24 hours a day for months. You explained how the enemy were. They were not cowards. He said they were well-armed and they could fight.

316
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Yeah, sure a sergeant, some smart ass heckled from the back of the auditorium, tell us a war story.

317
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:50.000
His glance swept over us. I'm not going to tell you any war stories. You'll have your own soon enough. And some of you won't live long enough to tell them.

318
00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Three days later, I was sitting ashore with orders assigning me to the 20th-air ground signal liaison in Busan as far south as you could go.

319
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
But I hadn't come to Korea to repair radios, and I wasn't about to sit out the war in Busan.

320
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
There were plenty of guys around who would be happy with those orders they didn't need me. I went up to see the captain and explained that I was an infantry paratrooper,

321
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000
and I expected to go to the 187th-air-born regimental combat team or back to the second infantry division, both wearing country. He scarcely heard me. He said,

322
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:35.000
What I'd been hearing ever since I had joined the army, impossible. I was humiliated and furious and stormed back to where my gear lay piled on the wet ground.

323
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:44.000
I was surrounded by troops who had been wounded and who were now returning to their units. Our artillery pounded to the north. I wasn't going south.

324
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:54.000
The next day, when they loaded trucks aimed north, I picked one with second division on its bumper and leaped the board. I was a-wall in Korea.

325
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:10.000
You know what A-wall means, right? Absent without leave. So he's just got this cushy job repairing radios, and he randomly selects a vehicle and jumps on board.

326
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:22.000
You think that's like, you go, okay, that's kind of crazy. Well, look at this. The truck was a mixed bag of vets and replacements from a half-a-dove and dozen different countries. A Korean was driving.

327
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I soon discovered that I was the only American aboard. I also learned from one of the Koreans who spoke English better than I did that the truck belonged, not to the US-second infantry division,

328
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:39.000
but to the Republic of Korea Army-second infantry division. So I first saw combat in a Korean division, but at least I was in battle.

329
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:54.000
And look, I could- I could easily just turn this into an audio book and read the entire freaking thing. Like, it's- there's so much- there's so much interesting things that happen.

330
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:02.000
You kind of have to read it yourself, and I apologize. I don't want to do a full audio book of this.

331
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Because I'm reading this thing and I'll be like, well, I can't read the whole book and then you read something crazy.

332
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
This could never happen nowadays, right? No. Obviously. No, good.

333
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Like, I mean, I guess it kind of could. It kind of could actually look-

334
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Hey, man, you're in country. You know, you could- you could get away with a lot. You could get away with a lot because they don't have-

335
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
They don't have, you know, you could- you could kind of make things happen, right? Just like, you know, you're sneaking into a concert.

336
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
You kind of act like you know what you're doing, and you kind of walk past the door man, like you're going to- you got some task that you're supposed to do.

337
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Yeah. You've got no one says anything to you. So, you know, you throw your name. Hey, can you put me on that manifest to get this flight up to Baghdad?

338
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000
You know, something to be like, well, where are you from? I'm from a sealed team that's supposed to be up there. You know, names willing.

339
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Well, what happened? Oh, and I was late, you know, I was- my kid was sick, and I got here late. I'm just trying to get up with my unit.

340
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And they're like, they're just going to hook you up, right? Right? Yeah. That's the problem.

341
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
No, I wasn't talking to tilt. Yeah.

342
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
It was either tilt or it was. It might have been Dick Thompson who was like,

343
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000
We've evolved into your go to Vietnam. I was like, yeah, cool. Yeah, you're good. You're in. It wasn't like, hey, can I please go?

344
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Yeah. You want to go to NAM? Cool. Oh, you want to go to Special Forces? Cool. You want to go to, you want to go to Salk? Cool. No problem.

345
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Yeah. So, it's sort of a little bit of that. Still like nowadays, I think you could get away with some of this.

346
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
It would be a little bit trickier. Yeah. Many, in case those strap hangers roll around the country.

347
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Do, do, do, do. Yeah. It's surprisingly influential when someone just sounds like and looks like they know what they're talking about.

348
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Hey, man, you know what, you know how you know how you know what someone's rank is? They have a little patch that's velcroed onto their thing.

349
00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.000
So, yeah. Freaking to Andy Stomph talking about that. Andy Stomph would like to put make himself a, make himself a lieutenant commander.

350
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
And he's a, he'd make himself four ranks above what he actually was.

351
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, and I guess, right. I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, yeah, they chose to look into it.

352
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And it's like, yeah, they could eventually find out. But if you're just, you know, raising no suspicion because you look like, you know what you're talking about.

353
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Like, you're not going to look into every little thing that happens.

354
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Yeah. Especially, there's a war going on. You're like, oh, you're a placement cool.

355
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Yeah. You're not like, let me see your paperwork.

356
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Yeah. By the way, when asked for your paperwork, you say, oh, yeah, you got blown up.

357
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Yeah. And it's not like you're trying to do something that a normal person would be thinking is advantageous for you.

358
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
It's not like you're saying, hey, I need to get on a plane. Did you go to Japan?

359
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Right. There are people who probably say, hey, what do we mean?

360
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
We need to go to Japan. Yeah. What's, what's he talking about?

361
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
That's not happening. But if you're saying, hey, I want to go to the front lines.

362
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Yeah. Hey. And you're going to see his whole tour, basically. He's A-wall.

363
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
He's A-wall. This whole tour just, and he does exactly what you said.

364
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
He kind of shows up and gets with a company and starts working.

365
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
So, he's in a way. It's almost like a crazy irony where he's A-wall, but he's A-wall because he's not A-wall.

366
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
He's even saying he's like, yes. Yeah. He's B-wall.

367
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I'm going to get some, he's get some wall.

368
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Yeah. You could get, I think you could get away with some of it.

369
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
I mean, I know that we definitely did some, let me give you an example.

370
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
We did things that were not normal. You know, maybe not a fish.

371
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
You know, not a fish in the noobers. You know, my, my C-B, so I had C-Bs that,

372
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
which is construction battalion. So they're navy guys that do construction.

373
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
And they've got a really awesome historical story in that they would build airfields in World War II.

374
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000
And they did, and there's part of the underwater demolition teams that use some of that experience from the C-Bs.

375
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
So there's a, there's a connection there. Anyways, C-Bs are C-Bs.

376
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
The C-Bs that worked for me. They did some stuff that was not a big deal.

377
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000
That was not above that was not 100% let's say authorized. Right. For instance,

378
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000
we need a piece of equipment. We need a piece of gear. We need a bunch of lumber to build something.

379
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Basically, my C-Bs would figure out how to get that stuff that we needed.

380
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
And you know, there might be trading stakes or whatever, captured weapons, whatever, just whatever random things.

381
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And here you go. Yeah, makes stuff work. So there's definitely, it's a little bit more.

382
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:45.000
It's wild west, right? You heard, like Iraq or Afghanistan described it. Oh, is the wild west out there?

383
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Yeah, here people say that. It takes a little while for the administrative things to catch up.

384
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000
So when you're waiting for administrative things to catch up, there's some shady activities happening. You're making some things happen.

385
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Who's a guy and there's a movie about it? He's like a young kid and he'd go and he'd be a pilot and he'd really like do stuff.

386
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah, I like, I don't know the name of the movie, but I know what you're talking about, but I never watched it either.

387
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Yeah, would he like get and fly a plane and yeah, yeah, he would apparently the story I didn't see the movie either,

388
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
but I remember seeing, no, it was an interview. He was on like a podge.

389
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Yeah, the real guy. Yeah, the real guy. And he's older or whatever, but he's same like, yeah, he's main thing.

390
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
You just act like you know what you're doing. That's all you gotta do.

391
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
That's always a good one. And so he could be like this young kid, even though like straight up, like someone that young will never be a pilot,

392
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
like it just doesn't happen like that. And he just act like he knew what he was doing. And they'd be like, yeah, cool.

393
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
That's why they call it a con man, right? Because you have to have this confidence level of confidence.

394
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:57.000
So he's got a level of confidence here just to jump on with a bunch of North Koreans. The reason that I'm went off on this tangent about not reading everything is because he jumps in, he's in combat with these guys.

395
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.000
He says, uh, the first guy I was sure that I had shot bounded into the air, then dropped over a ledge before us.

396
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
It was my first sure kill, but I felt neither revulsion nor sense of power just in difference.

397
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.000
I had had more compassion for rabbits and deer, a guy with a rifle in his hands coming to kill me did nothing to stir my sympathy.

398
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Subsequent years of combat and Korean Vietnam served only confirmed and strengthened that feeling.

399
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Ten minutes later, I was out of ammunition. This is his first scenario. Ten minutes later, I'm out of ammunition.

400
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Everyone else on my side had already taken off, so I picked up a wounded Korean and helped him back to where I had joined the unit.

401
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Now look what happens. He finds a Jeep with four American GIs and just kind of rolls with them because he doesn't want to be, he's with Koreans.

402
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
With people that aren't speaking, he does a few people. Let's be. Can you move on most of them?

403
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And then he jumps in with them, ends up going to this replacement depot and load. He gets loaded onto a box car.

404
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
That's, that's heading south.

405
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
And then a couple days later, he ends up where he's supposed to be. Okay, so a couple days later, we were near enough for me to make my move. Oh, he gets to Busan.

406
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So he gets back to Busan because he's with the Korean unit. He doesn't want to be with the Korean unit. So he goes back to Busan to figure out like, okay, how can I get with some Americans?

407
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
He gets back there.

408
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
And a couple days later, we were near enough for me to make my move. I stole a Jeep and drove over to the 23rd.

409
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.000
They were preparing for to jump off for the Yalu River, a push north designed to end the war. Headed home was the modded hot motto home by Christmas.

410
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
My car thru promised rumor had it that the seventh infantry division and the Marines were already rolling north.

411
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:47.000
The rocks already have more men on the yay Lou on the yay Lou than the Chinese on the mainland to put it together.

412
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Someone's wore helmets as good as over. I felt a pain in my heart, but what the hell a short war is better than none.

413
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
The other side's life is full of surprise. So he steals a Jeep to go and again, right?

414
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
This guy's just getting after it.

415
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
The temperature plummeted to 20 below.

416
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Again, I'm trying to figure out what to read, but you read, you see that the temperatures 20 below.

417
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Let's make sure everybody knows.

418
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Extra equipment and ammunition we're issued.

419
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
We began to feel a fever for conquest.

420
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
We were going to end it. The big attack was on.

421
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Not by us, but by the Chinese.

422
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:37.000
One million strong they came at us across the Yalu River out of Manchuria surrounded by more than 30 fold divisions are attacked turned into a route.

423
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So then this happened. So he's, they're starting to kind of get beat up and the sergeant comes off.

424
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
We got to get more troops up here. The Turks are somewhere off close to the east.

425
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Do you know where they are?

426
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Sorry, I don't even know where we are. He ignored it.

427
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Well, I know where they're supposed to be.

428
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
But I'd hope maybe you know for sure. He dropped the finger on my shoulder.

429
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
I've got to send you after them.

430
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I don't have anyone to spare. It's another lesson of war.

431
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
If you don't belong to the unit, you can be spared.

432
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
So he's just tagging along with these guys.

433
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And so the sergeants like, okay, well, I need somebody to go do something to you.

434
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Sure, I'll go. I heard myself volunteer. That was all.

435
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
He didn't know any more about the Turks than I did.

436
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
If I found them okay, if I didn't, that was okay too.

437
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Two hours later, I located their lead element.

438
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
They were still heading north, looking for more Chinese,

439
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
which said just about all there is to say about them.

440
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Every other unit was heading south, running from the Chinese while the Turks were moving north,

441
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
looking for Chinese.

442
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
And the Chinese were desperately trying to avoid them.

443
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
I couldn't talk to the Turks.

444
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And they couldn't talk to me.

445
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
I tried to get across what I wanted, but it was useless.

446
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
They had their orders. Attack north.

447
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Night closed in and I stayed.

448
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
So he's supposed to go figure out what they're doing.

449
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And he can't even communicate with them to get them to do what he needed them to do.

450
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
So he stays with them for a while.

451
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Then he decides, I'm fast forward.

452
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
He decides he's got to leave and go back in the at least tell him, hey,

453
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
this is where the Turks are.

454
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
I don't speak their language.

455
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And what do you want me to do next?

456
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
And in order to leave, he heads off to the north.

457
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
He thinks it's going to be the best way to go.

458
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
And here we go back to the book.

459
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I looked ahead and spotted about 200 Chinese coming across the valley.

460
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Not more than 100 yards out.

461
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
I dropped down behind some rocks and fallen timbers and stretched out on my belly in the snow.

462
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Recalling the dead captain.

463
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
That's what I opened up with.

464
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I eased my rifle off safe.

465
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
I wasn't about to be taken alive.

466
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
They came straight up.

467
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
The finger toward me and passed.

468
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
I was safe.

469
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
I was ready to move again.

470
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I put my hands down to push myself up when all hell broke loose.

471
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
The Turks had opened up with everything they had and Chinese swarmed back down the hill toward me.

472
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I was halfway to my feet.

473
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
It was too late to drop back now and I couldn't just stand there.

474
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
I spun the rifle around and opened up on three or four nearest to me.

475
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Weapons flew in the air and bodies went sailing past me.

476
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Asked over heels.

477
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
I snatched up one of their burps and squeezed the trigger along.

478
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Sharp rip, rent the air and more bodies tumbled by.

479
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
As fast as I emptied one weapon, I scooped up another.

480
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
I had him by the balls.

481
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
I could fire at anything in any direction.

482
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
They couldn't fire without hitting their own troops, running and milling around in confusion.

483
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Some headed back up the hill and the Turks opened up again.

484
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
When they came back down, I dropped another couple dozen.

485
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Suddenly it fell silent.

486
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
It was no time for me to move.

487
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
I got back down and waited.

488
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
At first light, the Turks sent a patrol to see what the score was.

489
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Between us, we had accounted for almost 200.

490
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
My foxhole buddy convinced them that I had gone out after the entire group alone.

491
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
And I became an archa-dush, their brother.

492
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Later when I stood before their president, the only foreign soldier ever received the Turkish equivalent of the congressional metal of honor.

493
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
So now he's in position with the Turks.

494
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
And here we go again.

495
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
And I'm probably going to be saying that a lot as we read through this.

496
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Here we go again.

497
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Their in position and shit just gets crazy.

498
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
The major assault came from the west, and it wasn't too swift since we had the sun at our backs.

499
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Some men fought some just froze, but the Turks rose as one man with fixed bayonets and met the charge head on about 20 yards out from the column flanks.

500
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Steel clashing against steel, screams of pain and terror intermingling.

501
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
But not a sound from the Turks.

502
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.000
The Turks, who I came to know well, who and who later died, slashed across the faces of three Chinese with one great sweep of his blade.

503
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Another a master sergeant who would later visit my home in the States as a hero of his nation.

504
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
And as an honored guest of ours, gutted two more at my side.

505
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
They loved it.

506
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
But the Chinese, I saw already had no stomach for it.

507
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
They routed quickly and fell back abandoning their dead and wounded.

508
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
The wounded, the Turks finished off.

509
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
They gave no quarter and asked none.

510
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
By the way, just FYI, just so everyone knows, we're talking about bayonet battles.

511
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Jumping ahead a little bit here now, they're in a column.

512
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
So they've kind of, they kind of been roughed up.

513
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
And even though they've done some hard fighting, they're heading south.

514
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
They got lots of casualties.

515
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
They're in rough shape.

516
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
He's back with Americans now.

517
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
As dark descended, we saw Chinese troops perch like buzzards on the heights around us.

518
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Our column froze to a halt.

519
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Ammo was low.

520
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
There was no ration hand out.

521
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:39.000
The few men who had sea rats mostly passed them to the wounded with no wire for setting up a defense that column had to move.

522
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
A truck pass close to me and I fell behind it.

523
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Letting my ass drag a little.

524
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Suddenly my feet flew out from under me and I cracked my chin on the ice.

525
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
I bound up fast like a novice boxer and bearers by a sudden unexpected knockdown.

526
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
In the first round, my hands were sticky with blood.

527
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
I glanced up and saw it, sluicing from under the tailgate of the truck.

528
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Load of wounded and dead before me and freezing on the surface of the road.

529
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000
I remembered running behind my brothers' ice delivery truck as a kid watching water drip out.

530
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
As the ice melted in the summer sun, what a waste of water.

531
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Then it hit me.

532
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
War.

533
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
What a waste of blood.

534
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Glancing back into the darkness.

535
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
At the hills crawling with Chinese, I realized that sometimes the alternatives were worse.

536
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
So I straighted myself up.

537
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
14 miles wasn't that far.

538
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Two men came beside me in the darkness.

539
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
One of them had one arm gone, the other both.

540
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
They needed space in one of the trucks.

541
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Myself and another soldier climbed aboard and sifted through the wounded for the dead.

542
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
We unloaded eight bodies and laid them at the side of the road.

543
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Help the two wounded climb aboard.

544
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Then drop back again behind the truck.

545
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Word came back again.

546
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Keep the column moving or stop in place and die.

547
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
So like I said, they're in tough shape as they're extracting in this situation.

548
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
And again, they explain how they end up there.

549
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
But I'm not reading the whole book.

550
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
A feeling of confidence and well-being washed over me.

551
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
I'd make it.

552
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
And so would most of the others if they'd fight.

553
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
We were breaking through.

554
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Some men were beginning to rally.

555
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
One, when one truck driver bought the farm, someone else jumped in to take up the slack.

556
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
The column was moving.

557
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
It was made contact pull back, regroup, fight again and again.

558
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
But we were moving.

559
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Many died needlessly.

560
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Tanks and trucks plowed over them in the dark and confusion.

561
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Crushing dozens beneath wheels and trucks.

562
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
The sounds of battle and the powerful roar of engines drowned out the screams.

563
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
In the light of a flare, I saw a man's face frozen in horror.

564
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000
His mouth opened and a soundless scream as he went under the treads of a patent tank.

565
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000
It was unavoidable.

566
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
And it was ghastly.

567
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Three men were stretched out beside the road.

568
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
White phosphorus searing into their dead flesh.

569
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And incoming round struck halfway between us.

570
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
And I hit the dirt.

571
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
When I raised up, they had disappeared.

572
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
And a small crater hollowed the snow where they had been.

573
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
More artillery followed.

574
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
And I dove into a hole made by an earlier round.

575
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
There was another guy in there.

576
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Go ahead, you yellow bastard shoot me.

577
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Screamed.

578
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I still had dirt in my eyes.

579
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000
I'm not a yellow bastard.

580
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
I fired back.

581
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
And I'm not going to shoot you.

582
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
He was an asshole I figured.

583
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Still brushing dirt from my eyes.

584
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Look, I said carelessly.

585
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Meaning God damn it, can't you see?

586
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000
I can't.

587
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000
I can't.

588
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
He saw, I can't see anything.

589
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
My eyes cleared and I saw his face.

590
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
A massive searing white phosphorus.

591
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
He might have been one of the three I had thought was dead.

592
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Or someone else who'd been hit in the same round.

593
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
I scooped up chunks of ice and snow and tried to clean his face.

594
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
I led him out of the hole and over to a medic.

595
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
The medic lifted him onto the truck and began to tend to to his injury before the driver

596
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
threw it into gear and lurched back into the column.

597
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:21.000
I was still watching and wishing him well when the truck took a direct hit and disappeared.

598
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
My throat was on fire.

599
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
I needed water.

600
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
I reached out and broke off an icicle from a passing truck.

601
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I stuck the end in my mouth and sucked on it.

602
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000
It was sticky, dirty and salty.

603
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
It was frozen blood.

604
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
It dropped from my hands.

605
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
I moved out farther onto the flank again deeper into the darkness.

606
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Only a candy ass really needed water.

607
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Just before first light, I am both toward the head of the column and attach myself to the lead unit.

608
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
We came upon a unit that had gone before us, all of them dead.

609
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
And many disemboweled like the men in the village.

610
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
A young lieutenant laying a ditch with his leg blown off above the knee.

611
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000
I turned a kid at it and loaded him onto a passing tank with some other wounded already aboard.

612
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000
A couple of hours later, I found him alongside the road with a bullet between his eyes.

613
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.000
The back of his head was gone and his brains were splattered all over his vest.

614
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:33.000
We attacked some more, took some more casualties, took our wounded and mostly left our dead behind us.

615
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.000
We had lost 3,000 men in one day of the 7,000 remaining in the division.

616
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:58.000
So eventually they make it back and he gets shipped to...

617
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
He gets assigned once again to a rear unit.

618
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
And they're probably trying to take care of him, thinking this guy just went through all this hell.

619
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
And he requested to get transferred.

620
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Like no, I want to go to a frontline unit and what do they say?

621
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
They say that's impossible.

622
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
So we waited two days as long as rifle and went back on a wall.

623
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And reported to a placement unit handling, hospital returnies.

624
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:30.000
I teamed up with a couple of men from the 38th and returned to the unit then on down to its second battalion.

625
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
At battalion headquarters, we were asked which company we were from.

626
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
This is what you're talking about.

627
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
So he gets to battalion headquarters, not a battalion that he's even a part of.

628
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And they say which company you from.

629
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
And he says E company.

630
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
I said and was loaded on the back of a dozen half and delivered at company headquarters.

631
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
I was assumed to be a replacement from state side and was turned over to Dave Bernstein.

632
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
A wonder from Brooklyn, whom I came to cherish.

633
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
You see that bridge up there, we're going to have to cross he asked.

634
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Well, we've crossed it at least four times already two times south, two times north.

635
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
I noticed him studying me out of the corner of his eye.

636
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
They'll, they'll more than likely shoot us back across it again tonight.

637
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
He glanced at his watch.

638
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Usually the shit hits the fan about 10 30.

639
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:23.000
They lay on the artillery for about 15 minutes and then follow up with Takasan Chinks.

640
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Takasan, that means a lot.

641
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000
He studied me when he said it.

642
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
I felt myself flushed.

643
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Come off it man.

644
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
I'm no damn rookie.

645
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
I made it to Kuna Rhee with this outfit.

646
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
He brought me up short.

647
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
You were at Kuna Rhee.

648
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
That's right.

649
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
What outfit?

650
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Who the hell knows?

651
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
I was a radio man.

652
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
I was a radio repairman.

653
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
I lied.

654
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
I didn't have time to explain being a wall.

655
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
So he meets these guys.

656
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000
This easy company here.

657
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Bernstein signaled again.

658
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Now he's now he's with these guys.

659
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And this scene as he read this, it just gives you that.

660
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:08.000
I had to read this part just so you get a kind of a sense of sense of who he's with and who these guys are.

661
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
So he shows up.

662
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Bernstein signaled and I stood up and followed him in one of the huts.

663
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Inside it was a little casino.

664
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
The mud walls were covered with tap trees and silk blankets.

665
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
The white blanket's e-compety had liberated when they moved into the town.

666
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
There was a small fire burning in the fireplace.

667
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
The mud fireplace.

668
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:37.000
There were three fifths of whiskey on a small shelf and five half empty bottles in front of five soldiers playing poker on a silk covered table in the middle of the room.

669
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
One of the men, a sergeant, kept calling for bug.

670
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
That's bug's Hoover.

671
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
He's always calling for the bug.

672
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Aces, Straits and flushes Bernstein explained.

673
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.000
He introduced me to the men with whom I would serve until I left Korea or until they died or captured.

674
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Some stood up and shook hands.

675
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Others just nodded.

676
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
We watched for a bit.

677
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Then left.

678
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
What are their jobs I asked?

679
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Call me Dave, he said.

680
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
McPherson's the platoon sergeant.

681
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Used to be an 82nd-airborn, I think.

682
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
We kid him about the time he went a while.

683
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Came back and the old man said he'd never be a soldier.

684
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
That was in the States.

685
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
In four months he's been here.

686
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
He's gone from PFC to Master.

687
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
He was the same old man who promoted him.

688
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Max Tuff, but he's a hell of a good guy.

689
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Crandles a squad leader.

690
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
He hates war and he hates the army, but he fights.

691
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Billy Joe buckled his riflemen.

692
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
A PFC from Atlanta.

693
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
He's kind of new here too.

694
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Brinsons a drafty.

695
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
He's got kids.

696
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
One of them signed some of his letters.

697
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Though I don't believe he's even old enough for school.

698
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Brinsons a bar man.

699
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Bugs is a goddamn tiger.

700
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
He does anything and everything that needs doing.

701
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Sometimes he's a squad leader.

702
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Sometimes he's a platoon sergeant.

703
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
He's everywhere and anywhere.

704
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Wherever there's gooks.

705
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
If you're a fighter, you'll like him.

706
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And he'll like you.

707
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
If you're not, stay the hell out of his way.

708
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Who's got the squad on the sign to ask?

709
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
King.

710
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Forgot to mention.

711
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
He's a good Joe too.

712
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Hell, they all are.

713
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
He said fleeing up his arms.

714
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
No sense in trying to say who isn't who isn't.

715
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
He looked thoughtful.

716
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
The amazing thing is the age.

717
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Average is less than 21.

718
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And that's including the World War 2 vets.

719
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So there's a little introduction to the guys.

720
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Says the Chinese didn't attack that night.

721
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
But neither did we.

722
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Bugs lost his asset poker.

723
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Ten years after Errol Flynn and Burma.

724
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I was an honest agrade infantryman.

725
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I felt damn good.

726
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I slept well.

727
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So, well, here we go.

728
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
He just roll.

729
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
They just roll.

730
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
You know, the, you ever heard that added.

731
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I'm sure I've said it here before that war is a lot of weighting.

732
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
There is not weighting in this book.

733
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
There's very little.

734
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Because every time he's seems like he's going to have to wait.

735
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
He just goes, they will all find a lot of fighting.

736
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
No time to wait.

737
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yeah.

738
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Late the next afternoon, we were briefed by the company commander.

739
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Still later, we were briefed by our platoon leader.

740
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Lieutenant Malanowski.

741
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I was to go on patrol.

742
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
He said he was sorry to have to send me out on my first full day in the platoon.

743
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
But no sweat.

744
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
No real sweat.

745
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
He assured me it was only a listening post.

746
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
At 1800 hours Dave, Sauer's Crannell Tate, a guy called self-propelled.

747
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
That's, that's one of the top nicknames I've ever heard in my life.

748
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The guy's name is self-propelled.

749
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Freaking legit.

750
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
He had come to E company from an artillery self-propelled gun unit.

751
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
So his name was self-propelled.

752
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And myself were briefed by King, who would lead.

753
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
We're going to, we're going to bitten north for tonight to LP5.

754
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Nothing big.

755
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
There shouldn't be any trouble.

756
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
We'll lay low and listen.

757
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
We've all been out here before, except for Herbert.

758
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
He glanced at me.

759
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
All you have to do, Herbert, is listening.

760
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Watch for unannounced company.

761
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Okay.

762
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Okay.

763
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And he continued briefing and made it simple, clear and complete.

764
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
It's kind of crazy, right?

765
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Simple, clear and complete.

766
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
That's my definition.

767
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
My definition is simple, clear and concise.

768
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And this one is simple, clear and complete.

769
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
We moved out later.

770
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Each of us knew exactly what was expected of him and everyone else in the patrol.

771
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So there you go.

772
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
That's just a beautiful briefing.

773
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Everybody knew what was expected of themselves and of everyone else in the patrol.

774
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
These men were all business.

775
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
He goes out and feels now.

776
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
All these men were all business.

777
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
No scuffin' about.

778
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
No talk, no bullshit.

779
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
So these guys are squirreed away.

780
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And fast forward a little bit.

781
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
These patrols continue.

782
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
He briefs on some of these patrols.

783
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
What they're like, what's going on.

784
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
The weather is getting even colder.

785
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
The front line positions start to stabilize a little bit.

786
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Now.

787
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And it fast forward to a point.

788
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Tahirudotaj Jeyham trying to speak.

789
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Perrong E company all charges are over.

790
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
he company is in need in the position.

791
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Th dentro on like the knob of a hill.

792
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And we'll go to the book.

793
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The moon..

794
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Rose Full and Bright and the Hills to the north.

795
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.04
골� code limit Sharp.

796
01:03:21.04 --> 01:03:22.000
Or.

797
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
A trip flare...

798
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.42
Cro抉抉緊 racing cours the elephant to

799
01:03:26.42 --> 01:03:10.000
The behavioral park

800
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Well.

801
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.68
yards away. The flare drifted in its shoe to cross our entire front. Shadows climbing back

802
01:03:38.68 --> 01:03:47.72
around us as it disappeared then went out. Hold fire. Hey easy company, why don't you go home?

803
01:03:47.72 --> 01:03:54.52
This is home. You fucker go back to China. Someone yelled right back. Still neither side fired.

804
01:03:54.52 --> 01:04:00.04
That's freaking crazy right. They're calling you by your company name. Come down and fight.

805
01:04:00.04 --> 01:04:07.40
Someone on the other side blew a bugle and like a cavalry charge they swarmed up the hill.

806
01:04:07.40 --> 01:04:12.52
The moon came out from behind the clouds and lit up a sea of humanity racing over the bright snow

807
01:04:12.52 --> 01:04:19.08
toward us. They picked up speed. It was the bonsai charge of the Japanese in World War II all over again.

808
01:04:19.08 --> 01:04:23.96
We waited for their front ranks to hit the 75 yard line and squeezed our triggers.

809
01:04:23.96 --> 01:04:32.04
Nothing happened. A few muffled chinks. Our weapons were frozen. Firing pins

810
01:04:32.04 --> 01:04:41.48
immobile. Piss on them. Someone said and word came down the line. We pissed on them and it worked.

811
01:04:42.12 --> 01:04:45.64
The urine melted the ice and the troops all along the line began to fire.

812
01:04:45.64 --> 01:04:50.76
Man shifted positions to fill where individual weapons had not been pissed on yet.

813
01:04:50.76 --> 01:04:57.08
I ended up in a hole with a soldier from a third platoon. Herbert, I said by way of introduction,

814
01:04:57.08 --> 01:05:02.68
John's here applied without looking up. I took up a firing position and he continued to work on his

815
01:05:02.68 --> 01:05:08.12
rifle. A second later he dropped down beside me and jerked two quick shots into advancing troops.

816
01:05:08.12 --> 01:05:12.68
Good he said. Now let's drive the little bastards back to China. I didn't know where John's

817
01:05:12.68 --> 01:05:18.36
was from or where he was going but he had style. Yeah I said let's do that. The other men in

818
01:05:18.36 --> 01:05:23.40
line apparently felt the same way. We broke the assault at more than 50 yards and drove them

819
01:05:23.40 --> 01:05:29.48
back down the hill to lick their wounds. A kid to our right clambered out of his hole and started

820
01:05:29.48 --> 01:05:34.68
down the backside of the hill. Mick Fierceon was on him like a cat. Wherein' how you think you're

821
01:05:34.68 --> 01:05:40.04
going he asked? To the aid station the guy answered, I've got the chills. Kid, Mac told him it's

822
01:05:40.04 --> 01:05:45.80
30 below zero. We've all got the chills. Get back in that hole. I'm going back to battalion.

823
01:05:45.80 --> 01:05:52.60
The kid shouted almost crying. I'm freezing. Mac leveled his car bean. Get back in your hole.

824
01:05:52.60 --> 01:05:57.96
I don't have time to argue. His finger squeeze the slack from the trigger. Get back in that fucking

825
01:05:57.96 --> 01:06:05.64
hole. Now the kid turned in with head hanging moved off from the dark. We heard the thought of

826
01:06:05.64 --> 01:06:10.44
his boots as he jumped back down into his hole. The bugle sounded again. This time they came up

827
01:06:10.44 --> 01:06:15.40
the hill and battalion strength but this time all of our weapons worked. Whoever had come up with

828
01:06:15.40 --> 01:06:20.28
the piss technique deserved a congressional medal of honor. We piled the bodies on top of one

829
01:06:20.28 --> 01:06:28.44
another all along the front. My bar began to overheat and the smell of cordite and urine seared

830
01:06:28.44 --> 01:06:35.08
my nostrils. Flares popped overhead again, lighting up the slope below and the valley beyond.

831
01:06:35.08 --> 01:06:40.84
The Chinese were everywhere. Like ants they were coming in and waves. It was a standard tactic

832
01:06:40.84 --> 01:06:45.72
with them. The first wave was light. It was meant to draw fires so they could note and pinpoint

833
01:06:45.72 --> 01:06:51.48
our positions of our automatic weapons. The second wave was to knock out our automatic weapons

834
01:06:51.48 --> 01:06:56.28
and to overrun us or at least wear us down so the third wave could finish us off. This time

835
01:06:56.28 --> 01:07:02.52
however three waves couldn't be enough and they seemed to know it as well as we did. They had

836
01:07:02.52 --> 01:07:08.36
come prepared. Their leaders were pros and seldom underestimated who they were up against. They knew

837
01:07:08.36 --> 01:07:15.000
that any unit prepared to pay the price could overrun any position. These guys always came ready

838
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.64
to pay that price. John's was killed in the third assault. I laid his rifle in ammunition beside

839
01:07:21.64 --> 01:07:27.48
my own on the edge of the position. Then as an altar as an afterthought I extracted his bay

840
01:07:27.48 --> 01:07:34.20
net from his scabbard and fixed it to his rifle. I was ready. I tucked my boots beneath his body

841
01:07:34.20 --> 01:07:40.20
to keep them warm but he was already cold. There's going to be a long night by the fifth wave

842
01:07:41.40 --> 01:07:47.48
the Chinese had paid the price. The hillside before us was littered with their dead and wounded.

843
01:07:48.04 --> 01:07:54.60
We had sustained about 40% casualties ourselves. ammunition was almost non-existent. The artillery

844
01:07:54.60 --> 01:07:59.80
had ceased to fire in our support but last of our wounded were already on their way toward the

845
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:09.32
rear walking wounded carrying the dead and incapacitated. The sixth wave hit and the order came

846
01:08:09.32 --> 01:08:17.16
down to fall back to cover the wounded. I leaped out of my position. No one had come by to pick

847
01:08:17.16 --> 01:08:21.88
up John's. I checked his body. The rounded caught him smack in the forehead above his left eye.

848
01:08:22.60 --> 01:08:28.04
The back of his head was gone. I slung his rifle over my shoulder. Locked his cartridge belt above

849
01:08:28.04 --> 01:08:33.80
my own and joined the rest of the men. At the base of the hill we came to a road which led back across

850
01:08:33.80 --> 01:08:39.64
the bridge. Our battalion commander Colonel Skeldon was rounding up units and reorganizing them

851
01:08:39.64 --> 01:08:45.72
for a counterattack. His driver was besides a trailer tagged onto his Jeep passing out ammo

852
01:08:45.72 --> 01:08:51.96
when we were ready. Skeldon let us back up the hill. He had done so efficiently and so quickly

853
01:08:51.96 --> 01:08:57.16
that we caught the sixth wave not yet ready to defend. Within minutes we were back in our positions

854
01:08:57.16 --> 01:09:04.68
consolidated and ready. First light was breaking and the Chinese pulled back. We gathered up the

855
01:09:04.68 --> 01:09:12.76
rest of our dead. John's went back down the hill in a mattress cover. Sours and tate, dead went

856
01:09:12.76 --> 01:09:20.60
along with him. The Chinese had outnumbered us at least 10 to 1. They had weapons and guts.

857
01:09:20.60 --> 01:09:34.44
They had been willing to pay the price but so had we. You know when they get to wave number five,

858
01:09:34.44 --> 01:09:43.40
you're thinking wow and that's not it. Here comes wave number six and the reason that you

859
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:55.24
can't stay there is because you're out of ammunition. 40% loss had cut us down far below combat

860
01:09:55.24 --> 01:10:02.20
strength. We were ordered into reserve. Reserve it's a powerful word in a combat zone. It's a

861
01:10:02.20 --> 01:10:08.20
full night's sleep in a couple days. You're almost certain to live through. It's time to catch up

862
01:10:08.20 --> 01:10:13.000
to get your bearings, bearings and at time to find out how the war is going for the rest of their

863
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.84
vision for the rest of the army. Since a man in combat doesn't have much opportunity to look around him.

864
01:10:18.84 --> 01:10:24.84
We had find whether the sun broke through and the frozen earth became a clagmire. Replacements

865
01:10:24.84 --> 01:10:31.48
came in and were assigned to fill the gaps. Day after they arrived, E company went into heavy combat

866
01:10:31.48 --> 01:10:38.36
training. We reviewed attack formations and procedures, defenses with draws, marches and counterattack.

867
01:10:38.36 --> 01:10:42.84
We practiced until every one of them understood what was expected them under all conditions.

868
01:10:42.84 --> 01:10:47.80
We laid down the standard operating procedures which had worked for us in the conditions of this war.

869
01:10:49.08 --> 01:10:55.80
Good training cuts losses and we intended to cut our losses to a minimum. We trained and we trained hard.

870
01:11:03.40 --> 01:11:08.76
We got a few supplies by air drop. Sometimes those came in with mail from home.

871
01:11:08.76 --> 01:11:14.36
And all training would grind to a halt. Mail was considered a morale builder.

872
01:11:15.40 --> 01:11:20.28
Personally, I disagreed. I didn't write much and didn't expect to get a letter.

873
01:11:21.08 --> 01:11:26.36
I got them of course, but they didn't mean much to me. Home was too far away. What happened in

874
01:11:26.36 --> 01:11:31.56
easy company 38th Infantry Regiment was more important. If you kept your mind on where you were,

875
01:11:31.56 --> 01:11:37.40
the war was easier. If you let your thoughts drift to things that no longer existed for you,

876
01:11:37.40 --> 01:11:45.80
then you were in trouble. Letters I read quickly sometimes skipping entire paragraphs and I got rid of them.

877
01:11:46.44 --> 01:11:53.08
Packages I broke open immediately and shared their contents on the spot. I consumed my portions on the

878
01:11:53.08 --> 01:11:58.12
hoof and forgot them. It's good advice, man. It's a good advice.

879
01:11:58.12 --> 01:12:05.88
I was like, you know, I was like, you know, I was like, you know, I was like, you know, um, um,

880
01:12:05.88 --> 01:12:07.64
my cousin of a two and it was before the war, it's just like a normal deployment.

881
01:12:08.76 --> 01:12:13.96
Back in the doing. And I remember there was a guy, you know, like, you know, one of

882
01:12:13.96 --> 01:12:19.16
guys was married. You know, had a girlfriend or whatever. And I remember seeing him, he was just, he was

883
01:12:19.16 --> 01:12:26.04
staring at a picture of her. And I just remember thinking that he was torturing himself, right?

884
01:12:26.04 --> 01:12:30.12
And he was in driving himself crazy. And he made no sense to me. And I remembered that.

885
01:12:30.12 --> 01:12:36.44
And I was like a young, you know, single guy at the time. So I made a mental note that that's not a good

886
01:12:36.44 --> 01:12:48.12
way. That's not a good thing to do, right? Fast forward a little bit. Then suddenly and simply

887
01:12:48.12 --> 01:12:53.08
Malanowski notified us that first and third battians were caught in a pocket.

888
01:12:53.08 --> 01:12:59.72
And we were moving up north to give them a hand. And the good news is this time we ride. He

889
01:12:59.72 --> 01:13:10.68
signed us trucks by squad. Malanowski deployed us squad's abreast each squad to maintain.

890
01:13:10.68 --> 01:13:15.80
This is when they get obviously get to their fighting positions. Um, each squad set to maintain

891
01:13:15.80 --> 01:13:20.68
itself and calm until we closed in for the assault. Then we'd move up shoulder to shoulder side

892
01:13:20.68 --> 01:13:26.92
by side to take up marching fire. We topped the ridge and descended toward the valley that separated

893
01:13:26.92 --> 01:13:33.08
us from the burning smoking mass that was hill 554 hour objective. The planes banked off in a

894
01:13:33.08 --> 01:13:40.92
way as we started across the valley. Our tillery screeched in to take up the slack. Small arms

895
01:13:40.92 --> 01:13:45.80
fire from the hill cracked overhead and Mal gave the order to pick it up and get a move on.

896
01:13:45.80 --> 01:13:51.24
Chinese artillery came alive now in the ground beneath my feet rolled and heaved like the

897
01:13:51.24 --> 01:13:58.04
deck of a ship on a raging sea smoke fire and steel split the air like a tornado. And the

898
01:13:58.04 --> 01:14:02.76
cover of heavy artillery pound in my ears. Suddenly I was through it at on the height of the

899
01:14:02.76 --> 01:14:09.56
near bank of a small stream facing a 40 foot drop to the far side. A machine gun opened up from the

900
01:14:09.56 --> 01:14:15.08
hill ahead. The rounds of whizzing past my ears and splitting the air above me and I leaped.

901
01:14:16.52 --> 01:14:21.56
I sailed down onto the far bank. My boots driving through the frozen crust into the deep cold

902
01:14:21.56 --> 01:14:28.84
mud pulling myself free. I bounded forward into the next heavy cloud of smoke. The ground heaved

903
01:14:28.84 --> 01:14:35.64
the ground sloped steeply upward. I had reached the base of hill 554. I shoved my BAR

904
01:14:35.64 --> 01:14:40.36
selector to automatic finger on the trigger. My eyes straining to pierce the smoke.

905
01:14:41.80 --> 01:14:47.32
I began to ascend the hill cautiously. Somebody broke through to my right. My finger tightened

906
01:14:47.32 --> 01:14:52.12
and I damn near dropped them. It was Dave. Without a glance toward me, he crossed in front of me

907
01:14:52.12 --> 01:14:57.000
and disappeared into the smoke. The cloud blew away for a second and I saw him clearly. Both sides

908
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.28
called off artillery and shouts came along the hill to keep it moving and keep going forward.

909
01:15:02.28 --> 01:15:09.16
I hadn't fired a shot yet. Someone yelled grenades as they began to burst below and around us.

910
01:15:09.16 --> 01:15:15.32
Bug shouted open up and the line came to life sporadically at first and then with a marching

911
01:15:15.32 --> 01:15:20.92
steam stream of steady fire as men found their places in the line. Anything in front now was

912
01:15:20.92 --> 01:15:27.16
enemy or dead. I squeezed off one shot then waited. Firing blind went against the grain. My father

913
01:15:27.16 --> 01:15:33.24
had taught me to well. I held fire but then I saw that the tactic was sound. We were driving them back.

914
01:15:33.24 --> 01:15:39.48
Body's tumbled out of the smoke above down the hill below past me. I switched the selector to

915
01:15:39.48 --> 01:15:46.52
automatic rapid. A whisp of smoke cleared in front of me and there he was. Birp gun. The works.

916
01:15:46.52 --> 01:15:52.36
His face was a mask of shock. He fired first and rounds plowed into the ground in front on both

917
01:15:52.36 --> 01:15:59.000
sides of me and over my head. I dropped the butt of the bar until the barrel aligned itself with

918
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.68
the slope of the hill. The muzzle level with his gut and squeezed the trigger. Little puffs of smoke

919
01:16:04.68 --> 01:16:09.88
and dust billowed from his uniform and drove his body back against the hillside. The weapon

920
01:16:09.88 --> 01:16:14.92
he carried flew from his hands past me down the hill. Chinese voices above were screaming in the

921
01:16:14.92 --> 01:16:21.64
smoke. I continued forward and picked up the pace. As I stepped past the body, I had just dropped

922
01:16:21.64 --> 01:16:27.72
that glance down. He was dead all right. I attempted an entire magazine into him. I wasn't as cool

923
01:16:28.60 --> 01:16:34.04
as I had figured. I released the empty magazine and was inserting a new one when one of his buddies

924
01:16:34.04 --> 01:16:39.96
broke through the right front. I swung around. He was a kid. He dropped his rifle. Then changed his

925
01:16:39.96 --> 01:16:46.12
mind and made a dive for it. But he was too late. I seated the magazine with a crack on my palm,

926
01:16:46.12 --> 01:16:51.40
slammed the bolt forward and squeezed the trigger. His head disintegrated. I grabbed his rifle

927
01:16:51.40 --> 01:16:56.20
pointed up the hill and emptied it into the smoke. Then I smashed it against the hillside and

928
01:16:56.20 --> 01:17:04.76
dropped the pieces. I restarted my rifle in both hands and continued up. This time I knew I had

929
01:17:04.76 --> 01:17:11.08
fired four rounds. There were still 16 in the magazine. I had calmed down. Another body broke out of

930
01:17:11.08 --> 01:17:17.32
the smoke above me. My finger tightened on the trigger. It was bugs. Let's go. We shouted. We're almost

931
01:17:17.32 --> 01:17:22.92
there. I caught up with him. King had been hit. Who else did know? Who else he didn't know yet?

932
01:17:22.92 --> 01:17:27.64
There were about six of us still on the line. But the enemy was pulling out. The hill was ours.

933
01:17:27.64 --> 01:17:33.48
Shoulder to shoulder. We marched those last few yards. We were the first two to reach the top.

934
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:41.24
Within minutes, the remainder of the platoon moved up alongside our squad had been cut down to four men.

935
01:17:41.24 --> 01:17:47.56
Not a major action. It was just another hill for which we had paid the price.

936
01:17:49.16 --> 01:17:54.76
But it cost the Chinese dearly too. Their dead lay scouted all around. We had done well.

937
01:17:56.04 --> 01:17:56.76
We had won.

938
01:18:00.68 --> 01:18:07.96
Then suddenly as if turned by the hand of fate, our own artillery seemed to bounce back and flight and

939
01:18:07.96 --> 01:18:13.48
began falling onto our own positions. It was impossible for the Chinese to have spotted and

940
01:18:13.48 --> 01:18:19.96
called in counterfire so quickly. But ours or theirs, death was the same in a world of lightning

941
01:18:19.96 --> 01:18:25.96
bolts and thunder clapping around us. The earth underneath our boots blew up like a volcano.

942
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:31.88
McPherson, a few yards in front of me, rocketed up into the sky like a doll. Like a doll in a

943
01:18:31.88 --> 01:18:37.88
hurricane and came down hard. And that was it. As suddenly as it began, it was over. I crawled over

944
01:18:37.88 --> 01:18:43.88
the Mac chunks of ice and debris raining down on us and my mouth tasted like copper pennies.

945
01:18:43.88 --> 01:18:49.16
Basterd's he grimaced. Dumb stupid asshole bastards. Those were our tanks.

946
01:18:51.16 --> 01:18:56.68
He was shaken. But his only real wound was a chunk of shrapnel behind his right knee.

947
01:18:57.48 --> 01:19:03.80
He was out of it. He was stayed side for sure. Carboni and carbonis the medic came up and we tied a

948
01:19:03.80 --> 01:19:08.92
compress around the wound with the shrapnel still inside. You're going home. Mac,

949
01:19:08.92 --> 01:19:14.84
carbonis said softly. I lifted him across my shoulder, careful of the knee and we made it back to

950
01:19:14.84 --> 01:19:21.16
the platoon. There'd be no evacuation until there artillery led up and we already had eight wounded

951
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:27.32
besides Mac. The platoon was down to 21 and carboni was the biggest busiest man in it.

952
01:19:27.32 --> 01:19:31.88
We called back for litter teams and blankets. But it was no easier getting things up than it was

953
01:19:31.88 --> 01:19:41.32
getting them back. So we waited. Night came and the incoming stuff lifted. We said are so longs,

954
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:46.04
told Mac that he had made it and was headed home for parades and kisses.

955
01:19:48.52 --> 01:19:52.44
Just to get home to see the family will be enough. You guys have my address, see ya.

956
01:19:53.16 --> 01:19:58.20
To the walking wounded, pick up, picked up his litter and fell behind the others, headed down the slope.

957
01:19:58.20 --> 01:20:03.24
We sat down and watched them whine their way towards the trail in the valley below.

958
01:20:03.24 --> 01:20:11.80
Six walking wounded. Mac and the other guys on litter's. It was all we could spare. In November,

959
01:20:11.80 --> 01:20:16.84
even the walking wounded would have had to stay on and fight. So things were improving a little.

960
01:20:16.84 --> 01:20:21.48
They disappeared in the rocks below and into a mine field.

961
01:20:21.48 --> 01:20:27.88
Seconds later, Mac and three others came running out of the rocks and back up the hill.

962
01:20:27.88 --> 01:20:35.96
Men ran to help them. The other five were dead. They left the bodies and brought Mac and the

963
01:20:35.96 --> 01:20:39.72
others back up to the ridge. The wind picked up again and it began to snow.

964
01:20:41.32 --> 01:20:47.56
Everyone was too tired to waste energy digging in. We shielded the wounded with our bodies to keep them warm.

965
01:20:47.56 --> 01:20:54.68
Halfway through the night, a Chinese unit passed us by. By morning we were surrounded again.

966
01:20:54.68 --> 01:20:59.80
By afternoon, the tanks had gotten through to us and we were able to evacuate the wounded. So Mac was

967
01:20:59.80 --> 01:21:10.04
on his way once more. But our destinies are cut elsewhere. There was no escape. At least for Mac,

968
01:21:10.04 --> 01:21:15.96
he had survived the shrapnel. One light piece behind the knee from a hit close enough to destroy a

969
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:21.48
tank. He escaped the mine field. We were no longer trapped. He was on his way again and home was

970
01:21:21.48 --> 01:21:30.92
but a short way off. Then our tanks made another one of those errors. So common in war that most

971
01:21:30.92 --> 01:21:39.32
people never hear about. One tank had not received the word and fired one shot by mistake into

972
01:21:39.32 --> 01:21:51.24
the small band of wounded men. It was a direct hit. And Mac, the other three wounded and the two

973
01:21:51.24 --> 01:22:01.72
we had sent to carry the litter were blown to bits. Bitterness swept through me. I sat down in the snow

974
01:22:01.72 --> 01:22:10.92
and stared numbly into the distance. The hills here still white and blue. But they looked dirty.

975
01:22:11.88 --> 01:22:17.40
The sky was a swirl of muddy clouds. I let my head hang for a second or two and just stared at

976
01:22:17.40 --> 01:22:25.08
the frozen ground between my boots. Just little ridges of frozen mud with a light dirty snow

977
01:22:25.08 --> 01:22:34.60
coating the edges. The war had lost its glamour. Bitter at that base of the hill I raised

978
01:22:34.60 --> 01:22:40.36
hell with the tank commander out of frustration and grief. It had been a legitimate mistake on his

979
01:22:40.36 --> 01:22:45.72
part. One of the sergeants came over and apologized. I'm sorry he said it was my fault.

980
01:22:45.72 --> 01:22:58.04
It's war. I interrupted. It's nobody's fault. I had lost my first true friend in Korea.

981
01:23:03.96 --> 01:23:12.84
So the the horrible blue on blue. Something that everyone in the military, everyone in the

982
01:23:12.84 --> 01:23:25.16
police should think about all the time. I promise you. When things get crazy it is way more likely

983
01:23:25.16 --> 01:23:34.52
than you might think. This is an interesting part here. He says the army introduced rotation

984
01:23:34.52 --> 01:23:43.16
individuals with time could go home replaced by new men, quote, starting their tours. There was

985
01:23:43.16 --> 01:23:52.68
a reward before the end of the rainbow, a way out of war short of winning. It was the worst plan

986
01:23:52.68 --> 01:24:01.88
the army had ever put into effect. Men became cautious. They did their time and stayed alive.

987
01:24:01.88 --> 01:24:08.92
Soldiers no longer belong to a unit. They served in one until they completed a tour then served

988
01:24:08.92 --> 01:24:19.72
another. It was the beginning of the end. The purpose of all living is death. I had read once.

989
01:24:19.72 --> 01:24:31.88
The loyalty, courage and comradeship lent nobility to that purpose. In a very short time our

990
01:24:31.88 --> 01:24:39.000
army and our country would come to reap the fruits of depriving their soldiers of that nobility of

991
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:49.24
purpose. Those of us who are stuck with the old principles began to view ourselves as different and

992
01:24:49.24 --> 01:25:04.52
counted each rotation as they lost. In World War II you came home from war when we won.

993
01:25:04.52 --> 01:25:11.80
Some guys were two, three, four years. I mean just think about what that does to your mindset.

994
01:25:13.16 --> 01:25:17.96
Just think about what that does. I only got four more months. I only got eight more months.

995
01:25:17.96 --> 01:25:28.20
One day at a time I could get through this day. Fast forward a little couple days later. I got

996
01:25:28.20 --> 01:25:36.04
nicked in the wrist. Six of us won. Patrol down along the bank of a river. It's been one night

997
01:25:36.04 --> 01:25:40.44
me a decision when they showed me up and filled me with drugs to prevent infection. The next morning

998
01:25:40.44 --> 01:25:47.32
I returned to my platoon. Now the officer wanted me to go back to the mash for a couple days to

999
01:25:47.32 --> 01:25:53.08
make sure I was okay. We compromised if complications said in where I began hurting. I'd go back. That was

1000
01:25:53.08 --> 01:26:03.80
that. He's just getting wounded and just doesn't care. This is a little later. I was going to,

1001
01:26:03.80 --> 01:26:10.52
I was going to do get some shut eye, but I never had the chance. Heavy stuff whistled in right

1002
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:17.64
on us in the middle of my sentence. I a large gob of white phosphorus landed on my left forearm

1003
01:26:17.64 --> 01:26:23.72
and began sizzling on its way to the bone. So we both spent the rest of the day packing my arm

1004
01:26:23.72 --> 01:26:29.24
with cold mud to prevent the phosphorus from getting oxygen while we dug out chunks with our knives.

1005
01:26:30.36 --> 01:26:33.88
Then I went to the aid station to have the wound cleaned and soaked. Getting wounded was

1006
01:26:33.88 --> 01:26:39.48
becoming an annoying habit. The good news was that I got another night at the old aid station

1007
01:26:40.44 --> 01:26:47.000
to sleep in a tent fairly dry on a litter which kept my ass out of the mud. It was almost worth

1008
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.48
getting hit for a night of uninterrupted sleep. No posting about posts. No being awakened every 30

1009
01:26:53.48 --> 01:26:57.88
minutes or so because somebody wanted me on the radio or the sound tower. No taking turns.

1010
01:26:57.88 --> 01:27:04.28
War has a way of reducing life to the basics and bringing home what the true comforts in life are.

1011
01:27:04.28 --> 01:27:10.36
uninterrupted sleep is one hell of a comfort. Cool water to drink is another. A dry bed, a hot

1012
01:27:10.36 --> 01:27:16.76
cup of coffee, a cigarette if you're a smoker, I guess. I'd seen enough dying men ask for one to make

1013
01:27:16.76 --> 01:27:29.48
me believe it was for some Ashana whiskey. Fast forward Chinese troops were reported massing

1014
01:27:29.48 --> 01:27:35.40
about 2,000 yards north of our permit. Positions in armed recon patrols needed to check it out.

1015
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.16
Approximately 1500 yards out the snipers bullet caught me in the upper right arm.

1016
01:27:41.16 --> 01:27:45.48
Slug went in, wrapped around the bone. It buzzed like a hammer blow to the funny bone,

1017
01:27:45.48 --> 01:27:50.20
but it didn't do much damage. The medic put a compress on it. We dropped down off the hill

1018
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:56.04
to put it between us and the sniper. This time they sent me all the way back to the

1019
01:27:56.04 --> 01:28:00.84
mash by late evening. A surgeon had removed the bullet and told me to be evacuated to the rear

1020
01:28:00.84 --> 01:28:06.44
in the morning. Get a good night's sleep. He said shortly after midnight, I a-walled from the mash

1021
01:28:06.44 --> 01:28:13.000
and hitched a ride on a truck convay convoy back north to the unit. I reached a platoon at noon just

1022
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:22.36
in time for sea rations. He's using a wall as a verb now. Like i a wall. There's got to be a better

1023
01:28:22.36 --> 01:28:34.84
term for that for what he's doing. Carboni's replacement, a medic named Ryan had been assigned to

1024
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:39.64
the platoon and pickens a new sergeant had joined us. Again, I was like, you know, you get to these

1025
01:28:39.64 --> 01:28:44.68
points to say, I got, but I really need to go over the, you know, should I read this part?

1026
01:28:45.72 --> 01:28:52.36
And then it just teaches you, teaches you. Pickens a new sergeant had joined us. No one was

1027
01:28:52.36 --> 01:28:56.20
certain whether you'd served in combat yet or not, but he was a master sergeant that outranked

1028
01:28:56.20 --> 01:29:01.56
me and I figured he must have had something on the ball that made to make rank. I went to meet him.

1029
01:29:01.56 --> 01:29:06.84
He looked like a sergeant, meet trim and in shape. He wore his uniform well and his gear was in order.

1030
01:29:06.84 --> 01:29:10.76
He talked like a sergeant. No bullshit and he gave orders like a man who knew his stuff.

1031
01:29:12.28 --> 01:29:18.04
Dave didn't like him. One more gun is one more gun. I told him not always her. He replied,

1032
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:22.76
then change the subject. He didn't want to talk about it. It was an odd remark. And an odd way

1033
01:29:22.76 --> 01:29:28.20
for Dave to act. He was no dope. And he said something was worth listening to. What he, what had he

1034
01:29:28.20 --> 01:29:33.64
observed that I had missed. I studied pickens carefully. For the next few days, nothing occurred to

1035
01:29:33.64 --> 01:29:39.56
change my evaluation. In fact, everything he did just seemed to confirm it. He had bearing command

1036
01:29:39.56 --> 01:29:45.32
presence intelligence training the works. He was going to be a real asset to the company.

1037
01:29:45.32 --> 01:29:49.88
Dave was wrong. Anyone could make a mistake. Pickens and I supervised the digging in and the

1038
01:29:49.88 --> 01:29:55.32
preparation of the defense. He was great at weapons and placement. By the end of the day,

1039
01:29:55.32 --> 01:30:03.08
we had a tight line that could throw up a wall of steel on command. Something big was brewing

1040
01:30:03.08 --> 01:30:08.68
on the Chinese side. Pickens decided we needed more tactical wire to our front. He went to the

1041
01:30:08.68 --> 01:30:13.72
rear himself to go pick it up. It was dusk and the sky was common. Beautiful. And that kind of

1042
01:30:13.72 --> 01:30:19.16
interesting. Right? Like you feel something brewing on the Chinese side and this guy decides he's

1043
01:30:19.16 --> 01:30:24.60
going to go to the rear. Dave is thinking, hey, this guy might not be all these cracked up to be.

1044
01:30:24.60 --> 01:30:38.36
He seems a little too, maybe a little too square away. Right? Little while later, Jennings

1045
01:30:38.36 --> 01:30:43.48
whistled to me. Hey, her, Malawans, you on the sound power. And we know we're going to took the

1046
01:30:43.48 --> 01:30:48.12
phone from Jennings Sergeant Herbert. Sir, her, get the troops back and their holes all hell.

1047
01:30:48.12 --> 01:30:52.20
It's going to break loose in a minute with my other here. I could hear planes coming in

1048
01:30:52.20 --> 01:30:55.96
on the dive, men started running for the positions before I even had time to shout the planes

1049
01:30:55.96 --> 01:31:00.36
drop their ordinance right overhead. I watched the canisters tumbled down through the sky,

1050
01:31:00.36 --> 01:31:04.60
out over our heads and crashed through the trees only a few hundred yards before us. Malawans

1051
01:31:04.60 --> 01:31:09.48
ask he was still talking. The valley is loaded with gooks. He was saying, get the men ready.

1052
01:31:09.88 --> 01:31:15.16
Followed or notify the OP to be ready to pull in fast when they get the word. Where's Pickens?

1053
01:31:15.16 --> 01:31:21.08
Wilco. Pickens went back for wire and hasn't returned yet. I said, okay, it's your baby.

1054
01:31:21.08 --> 01:31:31.32
Stay in contact. Roger that out. This time we had the men and ammunition. We had wire and we had land

1055
01:31:31.32 --> 01:31:37.96
mines and booby traps out. Our fire sectors overlap along the entire fund. This time they wouldn't

1056
01:31:37.96 --> 01:31:44.68
be able to afford the price. I looked up at the planes. Lay off guys. I'm motor to myself.

1057
01:31:44.68 --> 01:31:52.52
Let them come in and give us a chance. I felt good. I went along the line briefing in each position.

1058
01:31:52.52 --> 01:31:57.88
Dude, I just like underlined this section here. This is his brief to the troops.

1059
01:31:57.88 --> 01:32:01.32
Nobody moves out of position unless I give the word. No who's on your right and left.

1060
01:32:01.88 --> 01:32:07.08
Keep all gear on. Fix bay and nets. No one throws grenades until you're certain they're in range.

1061
01:32:07.08 --> 01:32:11.80
Remember, you can hear a lot further than you can toss a frag. Make shots count. Don't

1062
01:32:11.80 --> 01:32:17.40
waste ammo. Keep up a good rate of fire. If word comes down to fire, each man lays his rifle

1063
01:32:17.40 --> 01:32:23.72
against the stake we put it in and fires steady and a rapid rate on that line. All fires interlocking.

1064
01:32:23.72 --> 01:32:28.76
Until I pass word to fire at Wilcoe, the entire sector. Don't forget the tendency at night

1065
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:34.68
is to fire too high. Keep aim low. We'll cream them. We have fast resupply from the rear.

1066
01:32:34.68 --> 01:32:40.52
When ammo starts to get low, don't panic. There'll be more coming. Tonight belongs to easy

1067
01:32:40.52 --> 01:32:50.04
company. Good to go. Tonight belongs to easy company and it did for six waves.

1068
01:32:52.44 --> 01:32:58.92
The first five we chopped to pieces. We would have done the same for the sixth, seventh or

1069
01:32:58.92 --> 01:33:05.000
tenth except that some asshole back at company rear hadn't done his job. Ammunition was running

1070
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:11.32
low by the fifth wave. More was supposed to be on the way, but King called back to Malanowski

1071
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:15.32
and learned that the company headquarters had withdrawn. There'd be no resupply tonight.

1072
01:33:15.32 --> 01:33:20.28
The Chinese had broken through on the right flank where the Dutch who had been tied in with us

1073
01:33:20.28 --> 01:33:28.36
had already pulled out. We were on our own. Then the phone went dead. Around had severed the wire

1074
01:33:28.36 --> 01:33:33.64
or had been cut. I told King to alert the bautoon to be ready to pull out back down the hill

1075
01:33:33.64 --> 01:33:38.20
to the point where we had previously designated in case we were overrun. I picked up bugs from

1076
01:33:38.20 --> 01:33:43.40
from the hole to my left and we moved east along the back of the ridge to make contact with Malanowski.

1077
01:33:43.40 --> 01:33:48.12
Or to find out what had happened to the wire. We were still moving when all hell broke loose as the

1078
01:33:48.12 --> 01:33:54.60
sixth wave hit and came in over the wire and over their dead. Next thing I knew I was fighting hand

1079
01:33:54.60 --> 01:34:00.28
to hand for my life. The little mothers were everywhere. Bugs and I killed about 12 of them before

1080
01:34:00.28 --> 01:34:07.72
between us before we got enough opening to get the hell out. Let's go. He shouted. We were bound.

1081
01:34:07.72 --> 01:34:13.64
We bound it down back the side of the hill like two fat bears toward where our company command posted

1082
01:34:13.64 --> 01:34:19.88
been. There was nothing but fog. Either we were the last ones or the first. We dropped down

1083
01:34:19.88 --> 01:34:25.08
behind a log and tried to assess the situation. From here on we'd play at safe. There was no

1084
01:34:25.08 --> 01:34:30.28
telling who was behind us. Even our own troops would be edgy and friendly fire kills the same as

1085
01:34:30.28 --> 01:34:35.32
enemy. The rest of the Platoon had either gotten out or they were dead or captured. Let's get going

1086
01:34:35.32 --> 01:34:41.32
said bugs. The Chinese had pretty well halted the ridge. halted at the ridge. It was unlike their

1087
01:34:41.32 --> 01:34:47.72
previous attacks when they had to be stopped by fire. The shooting petered out behind us. We moved

1088
01:34:47.72 --> 01:34:53.000
off into the fog. Approximately 45 minutes later we tied up with the loose troops from other parts

1089
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.28
of the company who assembled at the pre-sad designated spot. I tried to find out about the platoon.

1090
01:34:58.84 --> 01:35:04.44
The company commander had been hit and evacuated. Malanowski had been catching grenades on the right

1091
01:35:04.44 --> 01:35:08.76
flank and throwing them back at the Chinese when one of them had gone off in his hand. He was in

1092
01:35:08.76 --> 01:35:15.08
serious condition but alive and had been evacuated. Nobody knew about Dave. Anis, Jennings and the

1093
01:35:15.08 --> 01:35:20.92
rest except they had been ordered to pull back. That made me the platoon leader and Lieutenant

1094
01:35:20.92 --> 01:35:31.40
Cunning, the commanding officer. They eventually make a move to get out of there and it goes relatively

1095
01:35:31.40 --> 01:35:37.32
well except for the fact that as they're approaching friendly lines again they realize that they're

1096
01:35:37.32 --> 01:35:49.40
in a mine field. They make it through the mine field and then they end up going back out and they're

1097
01:35:49.40 --> 01:35:59.40
in another hill on another hill again. We sat waiting silently. Dawn lit up the sky and the sun started

1098
01:35:59.40 --> 01:36:06.68
up over the hills behind us. Light crept across and down forward of the slope. Now we could see movement.

1099
01:36:08.28 --> 01:36:14.28
There were hundreds of them. They had evidently come in right behind us when we had been driven

1100
01:36:14.28 --> 01:36:21.88
from our positions the preceding night. Now they were halted, regrouping. I tried the sound power

1101
01:36:21.88 --> 01:36:26.84
to notify first, batowing in headquarters but just couldn't raise anybody on the other end.

1102
01:36:26.84 --> 01:36:32.76
I sent Jennings back as a runner. Some 60 millimeter mortar light stuff started up in the air around

1103
01:36:32.76 --> 01:36:38.84
us. The Chinese suspected that someone was on the hill. They might have spotted us or the men we had

1104
01:36:38.84 --> 01:36:46.44
relieved. We continued to watch and held our fire for the next two hours. They dropped 60 millimeters

1105
01:36:46.44 --> 01:36:54.12
on us but did no damage. Our air came up out of the sun and made one orbit overhead. Jennings

1106
01:36:54.12 --> 01:36:59.80
must have gotten the message back to battalion. The planes peeled out of orbit, diving one after

1107
01:36:59.80 --> 01:37:06.60
the other. The Chinese below held formation. Canisters of Napalm tumbled down, scattering flame

1108
01:37:06.60 --> 01:37:15.72
and twisted metal among their ranks. Still they held. A bugle sounded loud and clear from the

1109
01:37:15.72 --> 01:37:23.16
midst of the carnage and they came charging up the hill. Now I shouted, citing along the barrel

1110
01:37:23.16 --> 01:37:29.88
and squeezing the trigger of the AR. Rifle fire cracked in my ears from both sides as the rest

1111
01:37:29.88 --> 01:37:34.92
opened up with me. Our planes banked from east to west and the remaining canisters fell

1112
01:37:34.92 --> 01:37:42.60
cutting deep swaths in the ranks of the Chinese. But they kept on coming. They had manpower and

1113
01:37:42.60 --> 01:37:48.68
they had guts. We were butchering them but from their front line it kept getting closer.

1114
01:37:50.76 --> 01:37:56.36
When one went down another replaced him, our planes empty of ordinance banked off south.

1115
01:37:56.36 --> 01:38:01.64
Bugs passed word that ammo was running low. By sight I measured the distance to the nearest

1116
01:38:01.64 --> 01:38:06.84
line of Chinese and squeezed the trigger in one last burst before giving the order to move out.

1117
01:38:08.68 --> 01:38:14.76
The teams pulled out from right flank to left on order each following in, falling in behind

1118
01:38:15.32 --> 01:38:19.80
the one passing from its right. Crandal and I went last to bring up the rear.

1119
01:38:19.80 --> 01:38:25.000
My calculations had been accurate. We were able to pull back down the hill across the saddle

1120
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.04
and up into first bats positions without drawing fire.

1121
01:38:28.04 --> 01:38:34.12
What's more, we had done a lot of damage to the Chinese as we passed through their lines,

1122
01:38:34.12 --> 01:38:39.32
the men of first congratulated us and asked our names. I felt like one hell of a tiger.

1123
01:38:40.20 --> 01:38:44.76
The major congratulated and thanked us. You guys conserved in this patagon any time.

1124
01:38:45.88 --> 01:38:52.28
It was a top compliment. I shook his hand, saluted and reminded him we had to get back to our own unit.

1125
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.60
There was no transportation available as yet he told us. But tomorrow

1126
01:38:56.60 --> 01:39:02.92
I said we could huff it and I moved the patrol out behind me without waiting for an answer or

1127
01:39:02.92 --> 01:39:08.04
looking back. Jennings met us down the road and he had been nicked by a piece of

1128
01:39:08.04 --> 01:39:13.88
shrapnel but he could walk and he didn't relish staying behind. We hitched a ride with a

1129
01:39:13.88 --> 01:39:22.12
doose and a half headed southwest. Had I known the outcome for us, I might not have been

1130
01:39:22.12 --> 01:39:27.88
such a hurry to get back. Canning was the only officer left the live in the company.

1131
01:39:29.56 --> 01:39:35.72
Counting us, he commanded exactly 90 enlisted men. Pekens was gone. This is that sergeant we were talking

1132
01:39:35.72 --> 01:39:41.72
about. Pekens was gone according to canning. He had been avoiding combat ever since he had arrived.

1133
01:39:41.72 --> 01:39:46.44
I was the only one who had noticed. The day after we had come off the hill,

1134
01:39:46.44 --> 01:39:52.68
canning forced him to take out a patrol. They were creamed. Pekens came back ranting about being

1135
01:39:52.68 --> 01:39:57.80
flown deep to the sea into the jaws of death and sank to the ground, the babbling. Canning had

1136
01:39:57.80 --> 01:40:05.32
had him evacuated. Combat fatigue he laughed. Isn't that a pister? Anyone in the patrol dead?

1137
01:40:05.32 --> 01:40:15.96
I asked eight. Any of my men? A third platoon. He ticked them off Kyle, Fritz, Moon Song,

1138
01:40:15.96 --> 01:40:25.24
Donovan, Shoemaker, Benson, Condini, and Davis. Kyle and Moon Song. The old ranks were cut down by

1139
01:40:25.24 --> 01:40:30.92
two more. You're the platoon leader of second now. Until an officer gets in, I acknowledged.

1140
01:40:31.88 --> 01:40:35.80
I understood it was temporary. As long as I'm here with some say so, he declared.

1141
01:40:36.84 --> 01:40:41.64
We'll see, I thought. I was no officer. Malanowski had told me he was, I was a sergeant,

1142
01:40:41.64 --> 01:40:46.04
but I had never seen any promotion orders. I led whatever men I was assigned,

1143
01:40:46.92 --> 01:40:53.16
wherever I was ordered to. I was still in A-wall, and it would be funny as hell if I were still a

1144
01:40:53.16 --> 01:40:58.36
private. There were no paydays for me. My name was never on the payroll. The records were delayed

1145
01:40:58.36 --> 01:41:04.84
in the rear they said, I never contested it. What would I have done with money? The platoon number

1146
01:41:04.84 --> 01:41:10.28
at 18 men counting me. We had one machine gun operating, no rocket launchers, and amounted to

1147
01:41:10.28 --> 01:41:16.44
no more than a heavily reinforced rifle squad. But what the hell? 90 men wasn't a company either.

1148
01:41:21.64 --> 01:41:27.64
Yep, still A-wall. And like replacements are coming in, but they're not getting their fast enough.

1149
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.36
Now we're going to fast forward a little bit. And once again, they're on another hill.

1150
01:41:34.36 --> 01:41:42.92
All the chatter on the other side ceased about at the same time. There wasn't a sound for a few

1151
01:41:42.92 --> 01:41:50.28
minutes. Then rustling in a few whispers. Some rocks broke loose and tumble down the slope.

1152
01:41:51.72 --> 01:41:59.56
They were crawling up the hill, no bugles this time. Psychological warfare between the second

1153
01:41:59.56 --> 01:42:08.28
division and the Chinese was over. We had become a seasoned unit. They knew it and we knew it.

1154
01:42:08.28 --> 01:42:14.84
They were determined to get in close and destroy us. We were just as determined to let them

1155
01:42:14.84 --> 01:42:22.12
getting close so we could destroy them. In a very few minutes both sides would face the moment of truth.

1156
01:42:22.12 --> 01:42:32.12
This was Burma and I was better than Errol Flynn. No blanks, no bullshit. I was not an actor,

1157
01:42:32.12 --> 01:42:39.16
but a US infantryman. I could beat any enemy that lived. We sat and we waited. I could hear

1158
01:42:39.16 --> 01:42:49.32
myself breathe as I strained my ears to measure the distance. Then bam. The entire slope beneath us

1159
01:42:49.32 --> 01:42:56.04
was lit up. Beams bounced off the clouds above and ricochet down the hillside. Artificial moonlight.

1160
01:42:56.04 --> 01:43:02.92
I glanced hurriedly around and discovered buckdix into myself to be in the keyhole of a long finger

1161
01:43:02.92 --> 01:43:10.36
leading up from the valley at the cross bar stem of a junction of tea. I glanced down the stem.

1162
01:43:10.36 --> 01:43:18.92
And there they were. They moved forward towards us in the early light, like walking dead in a

1163
01:43:18.92 --> 01:43:26.36
cheap horror film. I pulled the pin from an M17 frag and sent it sailing down the finger. The explosion

1164
01:43:26.36 --> 01:43:33.32
drove four bodies up and forward into the air. Arms, heads and legs, flailing like marionettes,

1165
01:43:33.32 --> 01:43:39.32
whose strings had parted. The light of the explosion went out and I didn't see how they landed.

1166
01:43:39.32 --> 01:43:45.32
A second later we could make out about 10 more towing a machine gun on wheels. Bucklet fly this

1167
01:43:45.32 --> 01:43:52.28
time, taking out both gun and crew. So far the score was a US about 14 or maybe 20 counting the

1168
01:43:52.28 --> 01:43:59.72
advanced element. Chinese nothing. A shutout, which didn't hold for long. But the next group that

1169
01:43:59.72 --> 01:44:06.36
broke out of the woods to our front wasn't any lead element or single machine gun crew. It was a

1170
01:44:06.36 --> 01:44:14.20
whole damn army all along our front. Our men opened up all along the line. Body stumbled along the

1171
01:44:14.20 --> 01:44:20.84
entire slope before us. The whistle blew once and just as suddenly as we had poured it onto them,

1172
01:44:20.84 --> 01:44:27.72
they returned it to us. A wall of solid steel drove into our own positions. Now two grenades landed

1173
01:44:27.72 --> 01:44:33.56
in our hole and buck scooped them up and flung them back down the hill. Three more landed and he

1174
01:44:33.56 --> 01:44:39.56
did the same. This hole's two damn big dicks and shouted and they got us spotted. Another grenade

1175
01:44:39.56 --> 01:44:44.44
came sailing through the air towards us bail out. I yelled and all three of us cleared the position

1176
01:44:44.44 --> 01:44:50.44
as one. Two seconds later the grenade went off inside with a loud woop. Bucklet dicks and it

1177
01:44:50.44 --> 01:44:57.000
gone right me left. I rolled over on my stomach, smack up against self-propelled. He had a shelter

1178
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.80
half stretched out on the ground. It was field stripping a machine gun on it methodically and

1179
01:45:01.80 --> 01:45:08.84
unheardly as if you were giving a demonstration. He hardly glanced at me. Keep moth me her until I get this

1180
01:45:08.84 --> 01:45:14.52
mother working. Three Chinese raced up and emptied their weapons into the hole. We had just left.

1181
01:45:14.52 --> 01:45:21.88
Bucklet was reloading his car bean. Ginnum herbe yelled. But dicks and fired first,

1182
01:45:21.88 --> 01:45:27.24
blowing the head off the guy on the right. I dropped the other two, then ran my bayonet into one

1183
01:45:27.24 --> 01:45:33.64
as he tumbled by me. A grenade exploded among us and I felt myself flung backward down the hill.

1184
01:45:33.64 --> 01:45:39.32
Chinese broke over the top of the ridge. A bayonet slashed my upper right arm. Down the hill

1185
01:45:39.32 --> 01:45:44.60
men screamed all along the line. Buck grabbed me and yanked me to my feet. Let's go man. He shouted.

1186
01:45:44.60 --> 01:45:49.96
Another grenade went off behind us, propelling the three of us, asked over heels down the rear slope.

1187
01:45:49.96 --> 01:45:55.88
Buck jumped back to his feet first. A body broke out of the smoke above us. Self propelled

1188
01:45:55.88 --> 01:46:01.64
I shouted. Sawd of a bench. The figure shouted back. A grenade in his hand. Bucked

1189
01:46:01.64 --> 01:46:07.64
towards head off with the burst of about 20. Mother fucker he said. Hardly raising his voice above

1190
01:46:07.64 --> 01:46:14.36
a wister whisper. Visit your ancestors. We fought our way down the valley as far as we could

1191
01:46:14.36 --> 01:46:20.04
tell we were alone. But the Chinese were all around us. In the melee we got separated. Bruce

1192
01:46:20.04 --> 01:46:25.56
and Dixon went one way me and other. I rounded a bush and stumbled into Ryan and King. Let's go.

1193
01:46:25.56 --> 01:46:32.04
I said and started back down the valley toward the town. We're heading the wrong way Ryan argued.

1194
01:46:32.04 --> 01:46:37.48
Uh-oh, I fired back. This is it. The artificial moon might win out suddenly leaving us in darkness

1195
01:46:37.48 --> 01:46:43.64
with much of our night sight shot. I held us up for a bit to let her eyes accommodate. A bullet

1196
01:46:43.64 --> 01:46:49.48
passed through my left leg just above the ankle. I could walk but my arm was getting a little stiff.

1197
01:46:49.48 --> 01:46:54.36
I noticed King was limping. You hit. I whispered about three times. No broken bones though.

1198
01:46:54.36 --> 01:46:59.80
You Ryan nothing he whispered. Hold. Avoid snap sharply in front of us.

1199
01:47:00.68 --> 01:47:05.80
GIs I whispered back. Okay, come on in. There were seven of them. That made ten.

1200
01:47:07.56 --> 01:47:14.12
So just a debrief. What just happened? Freaking insane mayhem is what just happened. These guys

1201
01:47:14.12 --> 01:47:19.64
are getting attacked by the Chinese. They get pretty much overrun. They all bail out of the positions.

1202
01:47:19.64 --> 01:47:25.32
They kind of fall back in the direction of the last known area that they think they could go to

1203
01:47:25.32 --> 01:47:30.20
as which is this town on the way. They're getting separated and re-linking up with other guys

1204
01:47:31.08 --> 01:47:34.44
and then finally they relink up with seven other guys. So now we have ten of them.

1205
01:47:35.24 --> 01:47:40.28
One of them suggested we take off down the riverbed. Ryan wanted a whole up in the brush until

1206
01:47:40.28 --> 01:47:45.88
daylight. I next both suggestions. We'd go into town as a patrol. There had to be other elements of

1207
01:47:45.88 --> 01:47:53.48
the regiment there. The decision made. I moved up front to take over. We had one more contact with

1208
01:47:53.48 --> 01:47:58.20
the Chinese machine gunner when we bypassed in the dark either because he was dead at the gun

1209
01:47:58.20 --> 01:48:03.32
asleep or confused. Three members of the patrol dropped off on their own and headed down the riverbed.

1210
01:48:03.32 --> 01:48:09.64
Ryan disappeared and showed up three years later as a return to POW. The remaining six. So

1211
01:48:09.64 --> 01:48:13.96
there is losing guys. Guys guys, there's dropping off. The remaining six of us made it into the town

1212
01:48:13.96 --> 01:48:18.52
out of the frying pan into the fire. We had just broken through to batowing in headquarters,

1213
01:48:18.76 --> 01:48:25.80
which was surrounded. A major was in charge. I recognized him as a regular heller. He talked

1214
01:48:25.80 --> 01:48:33.000
tough, looked tough and was tough. How many of you are there? He asked crispy. Six. It's a help.

1215
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.32
Not a division but a help. A radio crackling nearby informus that there was no way to break through

1216
01:48:39.32 --> 01:48:44.76
to us until daylight. They wanted us to hold the major returned. We don't have enough ammo left

1217
01:48:44.76 --> 01:48:52.04
in last to last an hour. A flare burst above us caught. Call us standing there in the open. Here we

1218
01:48:52.04 --> 01:48:57.64
go again. The major shouted and rushed past us toward the patty on our east. For lack of any

1219
01:48:57.64 --> 01:49:02.76
place better to go, we followed dropping down into firing positions just in time to catch about

1220
01:49:02.76 --> 01:49:09.24
three or four hundred enemy crossing the patty toward us at a truck guns spewing.

1221
01:49:12.20 --> 01:49:19.56
Three or four hundred. We were next to a machine gun and between us we laid down a field of fire

1222
01:49:19.56 --> 01:49:26.04
that cut them down like a skythmoing wheat. Not a single one of them reached the perimeter. How long

1223
01:49:26.04 --> 01:49:31.08
is this been going on? I asked one of the gunners all night. We let them pull back their dead and

1224
01:49:31.08 --> 01:49:36.84
wounded. In the low we introduced ourselves to each other. Their names were Leroc and Macloud.

1225
01:49:36.84 --> 01:49:41.24
Neither one seemed any more distressed or nervous about the situation than I was. They went

1226
01:49:41.24 --> 01:49:45.000
about their business, cooling and professionally, making adjustments in the headspace of their

1227
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:51.48
weapon, getting more boxes of ammo ready and joking with each other and with us. Remember the

1228
01:49:51.48 --> 01:49:58.36
message out of baton and World War II when we were being overrun, Leroc Joshed, send more japs.

1229
01:49:58.36 --> 01:50:05.72
A young lieutenant came up behind us and introduced himself hurriedly. Name's Ben Calesky.

1230
01:50:06.36 --> 01:50:11.72
He made a quick pitch. We can break out and some of us will make it. He looked me in the eye. Are you

1231
01:50:11.72 --> 01:50:18.92
for it? I nodded. The rest of you guys, they nodded too. So there's the plan. We can try and get out of here

1232
01:50:18.92 --> 01:50:27.64
and some of us might be able to make it. Okay Ben Calesky said we're going to muster at the south

1233
01:50:27.64 --> 01:50:33.24
edge of the village on order. When they make the next assault, we'll meet them head on. Got it.

1234
01:50:33.24 --> 01:50:38.28
Got it. Macloud echoed. The rest of us nodded. He turned and raised away. I sat down to think. I

1235
01:50:38.28 --> 01:50:45.16
had always heard that when your time came to die, your life flashed before your eyes. I tried to

1236
01:50:45.16 --> 01:50:50.44
summon it but got nowhere. My mother, father, all those things were too far away. I thought of

1237
01:50:50.44 --> 01:50:55.16
some things I should have done differently but not too many. I should have kicked some asses. I

1238
01:50:55.16 --> 01:50:59.32
didn't and I should have said some words to some people that I didn't. If I made it out, I'd never

1239
01:50:59.32 --> 01:51:07.72
make those mistakes again. If I made it out. If not, then I'd take as many of them with me as I could.

1240
01:51:07.72 --> 01:51:11.96
My thoughts were interrupted by the word coming down to a symbol at the south end of the village.

1241
01:51:12.84 --> 01:51:18.20
No sooner would we there when the flare broke overhead lighting up the entire column. A machine gun

1242
01:51:18.20 --> 01:51:23.08
opened up from the road directly in front of us. Son of a bitch that Ben Calesky mumbled. We got to

1243
01:51:23.08 --> 01:51:29.08
get that gun. Got to get that gun. The words echoed through my brain. Two maybe three lousy guys

1244
01:51:29.08 --> 01:51:36.36
weighing less than 150 pounds each holding up the entire US Army bullshit. Life was okay but not that

1245
01:51:36.36 --> 01:51:42.36
okay. I scrambled to my feet and raced forward. Another guy came up with me step for step and we

1246
01:51:42.36 --> 01:51:47.64
headed south down the road together covering for the first 30 yards side by side.

1247
01:51:47.64 --> 01:51:54.60
Then there was this sickening thud of high speed metal whacking into flesh. As my companion

1248
01:51:54.60 --> 01:52:00.68
went down beside me at just the moment I spotted the gun position. I was 20 yards off. It's 20

1249
01:52:00.68 --> 01:52:05.24
yards out and slightly off to the right and I managed to get within five yards of the gun before they

1250
01:52:05.24 --> 01:52:11.56
spotted me and into the hole with them before they could squeeze off around. They were kids.

1251
01:52:11.56 --> 01:52:16.04
My band that ripped through the chest of the gunner driving him up against the back wall of the

1252
01:52:16.04 --> 01:52:21.80
position pulling it loose. I beat the second man to death with my rifle but bayonetted the third.

1253
01:52:21.80 --> 01:52:27.32
Then took a bayonet and the side myself from the fourth as I drove the butt down into his

1254
01:52:27.32 --> 01:52:31.88
skull which jerked the rifle from his hands and snapped the bayonet off inside my chest.

1255
01:52:32.84 --> 01:52:37.64
Bastard. I hissed as I pounded his skull one more time for good measure.

1256
01:52:38.84 --> 01:52:44.60
My buddies were streaming past me. I leaped down the hole and joined the rush. A second later

1257
01:52:44.60 --> 01:52:50.68
two Chinese flyweights pounced on my back. I reached back to grab some hair and picked up a

1258
01:52:50.68 --> 01:52:56.60
fist full of teeth. I stumbled and fell and the three of us went down helped her skilter. I bounded

1259
01:52:56.60 --> 01:53:02.44
back up alone and was off again. Flair's burst off above us lightning lighting the sky with flame.

1260
01:53:02.44 --> 01:53:07.88
Grenades were exploding all around. Men were screaming on both sides. Then we were in the midst of

1261
01:53:07.88 --> 01:53:12.44
the Chinese running parallel to the river. The major tripped in front of me and went down. I

1262
01:53:12.44 --> 01:53:16.52
reached down to pull them up. Go on, get out. Save yourself. We shouted at me. Thrusting

1263
01:53:16.52 --> 01:53:22.28
his pistol up into my hand. Here, take it. He was a small man. I yanked into his feet and threw him

1264
01:53:22.28 --> 01:53:29.08
across my shoulder. We crossed the river and we were out of it. Some men lifted the major from

1265
01:53:29.08 --> 01:53:35.64
my shoulders. There were eleven of us. Ben Kalski's arm hung limply at his side. Only one of us

1266
01:53:35.64 --> 01:53:41.64
a sergeant from the first Ranger company had come through without a scratch. Another mile down the

1267
01:53:41.64 --> 01:53:48.28
road, we met the unit on its way up to break through to us. There were men from easy company with it.

1268
01:53:48.28 --> 01:53:54.76
My legs were a little rubbery. Young mouchic, another Pennsylvania, raised with me back to the aid station.

1269
01:53:55.88 --> 01:54:01.000
The dock took one look at me and said the war is over for you soldier. You're on the way to the

1270
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:08.12
states. Young said goodbye, see you back home. I waved my hand at him, seen a couple days, man.

1271
01:54:08.12 --> 01:54:13.80
The major asked me to write my name down. He was going to put me in for the Medal of Honor.

1272
01:54:13.80 --> 01:54:18.60
I picked up a scrap of paper from one of the field clerks and wrote her book on it and handed it to

1273
01:54:18.60 --> 01:54:22.60
one of the medics. I laid down on the litter and fell asleep.

1274
01:54:32.20 --> 01:54:32.60
Yeah.

1275
01:54:32.60 --> 01:54:35.96
Crazy.

1276
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.72
I think what's that? He's been wounded with a bayonet three times.

1277
01:54:42.92 --> 01:54:46.12
I don't know. It's broken off. He's just.

1278
01:54:54.28 --> 01:55:00.92
An ambulance left me at the 11th Evac hospital unit where they took the out the bayonet, took out the

1279
01:55:00.92 --> 01:55:05.72
shrapnel, took out the slug, then tagged me for Japan and further evacuation to state side.

1280
01:55:08.52 --> 01:55:14.28
But I didn't mean to go home yet. I begged the dock to let me recuperate where I was. I

1281
01:55:14.28 --> 01:55:19.56
swore I felt fine, but they said it was impossible. I needed rest besides there were rules.

1282
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:23.80
There had been internal bleeding and I had lost a lot of blood. One of them suggested that I

1283
01:55:23.80 --> 01:55:28.68
volunteered to come back in a few months. In short, the answer was no. I could stay at the 11th

1284
01:55:28.68 --> 01:55:34.20
long enough to see Jennifer Jones who has arrived the next day. The day after I would be evacuated

1285
01:55:34.20 --> 01:55:40.68
first to Japan, then to the states. Jennifer came in the morning and shook hands with each of us.

1286
01:55:40.68 --> 01:55:46.12
The doctor told her my story as if I were a hero and she invited me for steak when I got back home.

1287
01:55:46.12 --> 01:55:50.84
She was beautiful. She was real and down to earth. She was going to have dinner with the wounded

1288
01:55:50.84 --> 01:55:59.08
men that night. But I missed dinner. When she came back, I slipped out of different exit. I

1289
01:55:59.08 --> 01:56:03.24
talked the sergeant that's applying to letting me have some fatigues and a rifle. Then I hit

1290
01:56:03.24 --> 01:56:10.44
to ride north and returned to my unit. Woon still draining. I told them at battalion that the docks

1291
01:56:10.44 --> 01:56:16.20
had to have the medic change the dressings periodically and give me shots when I needed them.

1292
01:56:16.20 --> 01:56:21.000
The wounds were to be bound and stitched after they had drained. No one questioned it.

1293
01:56:21.80 --> 01:56:23.88
And I was given a lift down to easy company.

1294
01:56:27.64 --> 01:56:34.92
Technically is that A-wall? No. Yeah. It is actually A-wall because you're being ordered to do

1295
01:56:34.92 --> 01:56:43.96
something and then you're not doing it. The company was on a sort of low-level reserve.

1296
01:56:43.96 --> 01:56:47.64
Not anything we hadn't been not anything like what we've been on back in the spring,

1297
01:56:47.64 --> 01:56:51.64
but rather regimental reserve. We were in defensive positions short of the front,

1298
01:56:51.64 --> 01:56:59.000
ready and reinforce whatever regiment needed. Or to be ready on call to spearhead the company had a new

1299
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.76
CO. Canning was the executive officer again. Three new lutenants had come into the first

1300
01:57:06.76 --> 01:57:14.28
third and weapons platoon. Command of second platoon was still mine. Canning had been true to his

1301
01:57:14.28 --> 01:57:18.60
word. I'd only been gone for a few days, but barely recognized the unit. Everyone treated me like

1302
01:57:18.60 --> 01:57:23.16
something special. I was told I've been submitted for an entire shit pot full of awards.

1303
01:57:25.08 --> 01:57:30.20
But Dave wasn't about to get me to bite on any of that bullshit. I mean who else I said.

1304
01:57:30.20 --> 01:57:37.48
I met Captain West, the new CO and the new three new lutenants. Tim's an X Marine,

1305
01:57:37.48 --> 01:57:45.48
Lieutenant Duboy from Duboy Street in Duboy in Duboy, Pennsylvania and Lieutenant from the

1306
01:57:45.48 --> 01:57:50.60
sovereign state of Texas who wanted to know why if I was such a damn good platoon leader I wasn't

1307
01:57:50.60 --> 01:57:57.08
an officer. I have Paul I explained. Captain West was a down-home type who was tall and lanky

1308
01:57:57.08 --> 01:58:01.72
and served as a commander in World War II. He had been recalled out of Korea for the reserves.

1309
01:58:01.72 --> 01:58:05.56
He made it clear that he would fight, but he wouldn't take Jackass chances. He talked real

1310
01:58:05.56 --> 01:58:13.32
clear in plain. We also received our first black replacements. There were rumors that batangin

1311
01:58:13.32 --> 01:58:18.68
headquarters had blocked at it and that there had been a knock-down dragout brawl at regiment

1312
01:58:18.68 --> 01:58:24.84
that ended when our CO was told there would be no more rotation until we accepted black replacements.

1313
01:58:24.84 --> 01:58:31.40
So the regimental CO had softened. We tried a couple. If things didn't work out after a month

1314
01:58:31.40 --> 01:58:37.16
it would be discussed again. Easy company got one. He was a super soldier. Probably one of the

1315
01:58:37.16 --> 01:58:42.60
finest sergeants in the whole damn army. The men were more than satisfied with him from the

1316
01:58:42.60 --> 01:58:51.000
day he arrived. It was the officer corps and the ass kissing senior NCOs at regimental and batangin

1317
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.88
headquarters who opposed the idea of integration. Most of the troops didn't care one way or the other.

1318
01:59:00.44 --> 01:59:05.48
The entire tenor of the war had changed and this is fast forward a little bit.

1319
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:11.16
Things were much better. We had broken the Chinese spring offensive. The second division was

1320
01:59:11.16 --> 01:59:17.48
credited as having destroyed more than 92,000 Chinese regulars, more than 36,000 of whom were dead

1321
01:59:17.48 --> 01:59:23.24
in that one three-day action. Word was that the north was ready to commence peace talks.

1322
01:59:25.48 --> 01:59:32.36
Bugs was MIA. He was last seen standing on a patty-dike out of ammo, swinging and entrenching

1323
01:59:32.36 --> 01:59:37.80
tool as he went down under a pilot Chinese. Gennings was missing an action. Most of the

1324
01:59:37.80 --> 01:59:43.24
replacements we had gained and gone down and gained and trained had gone down fighting. Some

1325
01:59:43.24 --> 01:59:49.96
know that we're at MIA and might show up as POWs later. There were men to be trained. This part of

1326
01:59:49.96 --> 01:59:53.96
the country who's new to me so I had maps to study our unit was not going to sit on its ass for long.

1327
01:59:54.84 --> 02:00:08.92
We're going to push north. This is where you start to see a different part of his character.

1328
02:00:08.92 --> 02:00:14.20
Maybe not a different part but you start to see some of his character come through again that

1329
02:00:14.20 --> 02:00:19.80
defines some of his future. One of it was him looking at the black replacements going like,

1330
02:00:19.80 --> 02:00:26.36
yeah, no factor. Let's do this. The other one is another good indicator of his

1331
02:00:27.64 --> 02:00:32.04
let's say his character in his mindset was they haven't started having some issues with some

1332
02:00:32.04 --> 02:00:37.40
gorillas. The gorillas stepped in again and we started to take sniper fire daily. The

1333
02:00:37.40 --> 02:00:43.56
unit was ordered to burn out some villages to deny them at base of operations. West assigned me the

1334
02:00:43.56 --> 02:00:49.48
mission and I refused. I tried to explain that I hadn't joined the army or volunteered for

1335
02:00:49.48 --> 02:00:55.48
Korea to fight civilians or burn their hooches. The discussion was getting sticky when Carlson

1336
02:00:55.48 --> 02:01:01.40
volunteered and got both myself and West off the hook. It was a fatal error for Carlson. He took one

1337
02:01:01.40 --> 02:01:07.40
through the chest from a sniper and went home in a body bag. I had hardly known the man. Yet I

1338
02:01:07.40 --> 02:01:14.52
felt the same terrible emptiness when he died as a headwind Mac had bought the farm. West asked

1339
02:01:14.52 --> 02:01:20.92
me if I'd like to go out and burn the villages now. No, I said he didn't push it.

1340
02:01:20.92 --> 02:01:32.92
What exactly is a gorilla? Gorilla is non-uniformed fighter. So if it's someone that's

1341
02:01:32.92 --> 02:01:37.08
dressing up like a civilian and they're maybe acting like this civilian but they're not

1342
02:01:37.08 --> 02:01:41.48
in an organized military so they don't have a uniform and they have a chain of command but it's

1343
02:01:41.48 --> 02:01:53.000
underground. So for instance in Vietnam there were the Vietnamese regulars, the NVA. They were army soldiers

1344
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.80
with uniforms but then there was also the VC right? You've heard that expression that's the

1345
02:01:57.80 --> 02:02:05.48
Vietnam. So they might live in a village and act like a farmer but then at night they have a AK-47

1346
02:02:05.48 --> 02:02:12.60
hidden and they attack. That's a gorilla fighter. So are they independent or are they like working?

1347
02:02:12.60 --> 02:02:20.44
You know, a little bit of both they're going to be less organized than a traditional military

1348
02:02:21.24 --> 02:02:26.44
unit would be a conventional military unit so they're going to be a little less organized and then

1349
02:02:26.44 --> 02:02:34.60
that just due to the fact that they're spending some of their time as civilians. But they don't

1350
02:02:34.60 --> 02:02:40.20
do the answer to like let's say you know the in Vietnam like do the yeah so the VIA Kong has a chain of

1351
02:02:40.20 --> 02:02:45.16
command and a structure and things like that and they're senior VIA Kong and they're senior guerrillas

1352
02:02:45.16 --> 02:02:51.56
in this situation. Gotcha but they're not they're not fully uniformed and I'm sure of like

1353
02:02:51.56 --> 02:02:57.80
could there's probably a more technical definition than what I'm giving but that's the general principle.

1354
02:02:57.80 --> 02:03:07.16
Is a gorilla fighter is not in an organized uniformed situation and probably is more or less

1355
02:03:07.16 --> 02:03:11.08
apart times. So even though like VIA Kong there was professional VIA Kong meaning they didn't have

1356
02:03:11.08 --> 02:03:19.40
some other job but then this is you could say the insurgents and Iraq same thing and you could say that

1357
02:03:19.40 --> 02:03:24.68
once the insurgents became ISIS and started wearing like black uniforms and flying a big flag

1358
02:03:24.68 --> 02:03:30.04
that was it's almost like they're not guerrillas anymore. Yeah an organized military unit.

1359
02:03:30.04 --> 02:03:35.72
Yeah that was kind of their uniform. They're in the black. Yeah.

1360
02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:48.28
All right so once again they're on another hill. I had left it was so crazy to think like

1361
02:03:48.28 --> 02:03:53.72
that story of him attacking that machine gun asked where he saves the major and all that.

1362
02:03:53.72 --> 02:04:01.96
That kind of that kind of could be the end of the book right. If he stabbed he's got to

1363
02:04:01.96 --> 02:04:09.24
bayonet in his chest he's been shot. You can kind of say like okay that's probably a good place

1364
02:04:09.24 --> 02:04:17.000
to go home for him and maybe end the book and all that. It's just not even close.

1365
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:23.40
So they're on another hill. I had left a listening post three men above and forward of the

1366
02:04:23.40 --> 02:04:28.12
original positions when the Chinese moved in they came around midnight at about company size.

1367
02:04:28.76 --> 02:04:34.04
The old the listening post picked them up and phoned the word about a hundred of them right on

1368
02:04:34.04 --> 02:04:38.76
positions. Get down in your whole sit tight. I answered then I called back to company and radio

1369
02:04:38.76 --> 02:04:45.64
two concentration numbers. Roy alerted the patrol to be ready to open fire on the old positions on

1370
02:04:45.64 --> 02:04:49.88
command which would be immediately after the first round of artillery exploded. Figuring we must

1371
02:04:49.88 --> 02:04:55.16
pull back. The Chinese began to chatter carefully. Suddenly there was one loud woosh

1372
02:04:55.16 --> 02:05:00.36
followed by three more and the world blew up in their faces. Fire exploded the entire finger

1373
02:05:00.36 --> 02:05:05.24
and draw lighting up the night in red, yellow and orange flashes. Silhouette's a body

1374
02:05:05.24 --> 02:05:10.04
shown against the blaze, winging through the sky, smashing up against trees and rocks. I gave the

1375
02:05:10.04 --> 02:05:15.48
signal and the platoon opened up. When it was over we had destroyed the entire company.

1376
02:05:15.48 --> 02:05:20.60
Or rather the artillery had. There was no question about it artillery destroyed more enemy

1377
02:05:20.60 --> 02:05:25.40
in combat than all other services combined including the Air Force. Death was sudden,

1378
02:05:25.40 --> 02:05:30.52
ripping, ripping violent. Most of the time however we used it badly and it was a waste.

1379
02:05:31.16 --> 02:05:34.84
Tonight we had worked well together and the Chinese had paid the price.

1380
02:05:34.84 --> 02:05:42.12
I radioed back the results. West wanted me to take the platoon out across and verify. I told

1381
02:05:42.12 --> 02:05:47.80
my wood at first light. He told me you wanted to do it now so he could notify battalion.

1382
02:05:47.80 --> 02:05:53.000
I told him I would do it at first light and signed off. He called back two more times trying to

1383
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:59.08
raise me. I whispered for psychs to turn down the volume. Quiet settled over the area once again

1384
02:05:59.08 --> 02:06:04.44
at first light. So there's a little little leadership, you know, little leadership scenario.

1385
02:06:04.44 --> 02:06:07.72
Getting told to do something that probably doesn't make a lot of sense right now. Hey, just kind of

1386
02:06:07.72 --> 02:06:12.84
turned on that radio a little bit. Don't answer. At first light I moved the patrol back across

1387
02:06:12.84 --> 02:06:18.44
the draw and we verified our three men were unscratched. The entire Chinese company including parts

1388
02:06:18.44 --> 02:06:24.68
of their officers were present accounted for and dead. I radioed the results to West. Good. Good.

1389
02:06:24.68 --> 02:06:29.96
He said great. And then with the pause, come on in. We'll send a replacement platoon down.

1390
02:06:30.92 --> 02:06:35.72
Not necessary. We don't have any casualties. I'll just send a party back for more ammo.

1391
02:06:35.72 --> 02:06:41.64
Then as an afterthought, we'll have to move though. It's going to smell pretty bad down here after

1392
02:06:41.64 --> 02:06:47.40
the sun comes up. Sure, certainly he said whatever you feel is okay, just give us your coordinates

1393
02:06:47.40 --> 02:06:55.08
and when you get settled in, we'll co-sure out. And I just highlighted that part because you can see

1394
02:06:55.08 --> 02:06:58.92
even though West was pushing him to kind of go out there and check. But at the end of the day,

1395
02:06:58.92 --> 02:07:03.96
he trusts what he trusts what his guy in the front line says. We don't need to pull out.

1396
02:07:03.96 --> 02:07:09.08
It may need some more ammo. Have to adjust our position. And it's just a good thing to see.

1397
02:07:14.44 --> 02:07:17.96
The fast forward a little bit. I was called down to regimental headquarters and offered a

1398
02:07:17.96 --> 02:07:24.44
battlefield commission to second lieutenant. Next time we were in reserve, I was to receive what

1399
02:07:24.44 --> 02:07:30.36
Dave had called that shit potful of decorations. The Colonel commanding the regiment explained that

1400
02:07:30.36 --> 02:07:35.72
many advantages I would have as an officer and a gentleman. But it was crazy. I didn't even have an

1401
02:07:35.72 --> 02:07:40.52
education. I told my preferred being an elisted man for the time being. Then he said,

1402
02:07:40.52 --> 02:07:44.92
you deserve to be the highest ranked one over here. And he promoted me to master sergeant on the

1403
02:07:44.92 --> 02:07:48.92
spot. He broke out a bottle and offered me a drink at the time. I neither smoked nor drank,

1404
02:07:48.92 --> 02:07:53.72
but I thanked him and sipped it while he discussed the possibility of my coming back for a commission

1405
02:07:53.72 --> 02:07:58.28
when I changed my mind. I thanked him for the promotion and the drink again and then went back to the

1406
02:07:58.28 --> 02:08:05.32
platoon. So he almost got the battlefield commission and said, no, likes being an e-dog.

1407
02:08:07.48 --> 02:08:11.56
West picked up a piece of shrapnel. Actually, the next day Fox company passed through

1408
02:08:11.56 --> 02:08:18.04
a lines into the valley. They swung east on a road and meander through the wide, low, flat farm land

1409
02:08:18.04 --> 02:08:25.40
to a major terrain feature behind beyond. He'll sick 868 on the map. They fought and died for that

1410
02:08:25.40 --> 02:08:29.48
peak for the next two days in night with us just sitting there listening to the battle rage.

1411
02:08:31.56 --> 02:08:38.28
West picked up a piece of shrapnel from an incoming 81 mortar round and we received a replacement

1412
02:08:38.28 --> 02:08:48.92
for him. A tiny, wiery, red-headed Irish man with a waxed handlebar mustache that was the pride of

1413
02:08:48.92 --> 02:08:55.72
Korea. Any man who can best meet at Indian wrestling is a better man than I and can run the company.

1414
02:08:55.72 --> 02:09:01.000
He announced none of us knew what the hell Indian wrestling was. So he ran the company and he ran it

1415
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:09.64
well. I like to put nine stars next to this. Here's a good leader. He joked with a man. He carried more

1416
02:09:09.64 --> 02:09:14.76
than his share of the load. He took his turn at watch in the command post bunker. He carried

1417
02:09:14.76 --> 02:09:21.000
an M1 rifle like the rest of us. He cooked his own rations and shared his water and coffee.

1418
02:09:21.96 --> 02:09:27.48
He was the best weed hat canning accepted. There was no difficulty in getting the men to follow him

1419
02:09:27.48 --> 02:09:35.32
or do their damnist for him. And he sure did his damnist for us. So there you go. Man, there he go.

1420
02:09:35.32 --> 02:09:47.40
So this one point I was there's a part that I'm going to summarize a little bit of it. So basically

1421
02:09:47.40 --> 02:09:55.16
what happens is there's these four Chinese designers that end up with the company. They're

1422
02:09:55.16 --> 02:09:58.52
basically a cop from, they don't capture them, but they're a designer. They come over and say we

1423
02:09:58.52 --> 02:10:06.60
surrender basically. And then they say that there's going to be a 30 man combat patrol that's

1424
02:10:06.60 --> 02:10:13.56
so a North Korean patrol is going to go down this particular riverbed, do north of the positions

1425
02:10:13.56 --> 02:10:19.32
at the end. And canning, the officer didn't believe him. Sounds like a setup, right? Oh, you're trying

1426
02:10:19.32 --> 02:10:23.40
to get us to go down there and set up an ambush. So he doesn't really believe him. And

1427
02:10:23.40 --> 02:10:31.16
Herbert does believe the guys. He kind of talks about how he psychologically was trying to figure

1428
02:10:31.16 --> 02:10:35.88
out why would these guys do this? They're really surrendering, like why would four of them surrender?

1429
02:10:35.88 --> 02:10:39.64
Why wouldn't you just send one to surrender? Why are you sending four guys to surrender? So he kind

1430
02:10:39.64 --> 02:10:45.96
of goes through his psychological profile of the guys and he believes them. So I tried to talk

1431
02:10:45.96 --> 02:10:50.52
canning in the new CEO and deleting me set up an ambush for them, but canning had prevailed.

1432
02:10:50.52 --> 02:10:54.92
And the best the new CEO would do is let me drop one machine gun team down to the valley on the river.

1433
02:10:56.76 --> 02:11:03.80
Turns out that the Chinese guys had told the truth. The gun crew and so now he did get one gun

1434
02:11:03.80 --> 02:11:07.88
crew down there. The gun crew opened up a couple minutes short of midnight. They had caught the

1435
02:11:07.88 --> 02:11:13.64
patrol in the riverbed, but the patrols larger than anticipated. And now they, the machine gun

1436
02:11:13.64 --> 02:11:19.16
crew was under attack. The new CEO called me on the sound power. No, I couldn't pull my

1437
02:11:19.16 --> 02:11:24.20
普通 off line and go back to reinforce the gun crew, but I would take or send six men to do the

1438
02:11:24.20 --> 02:11:28.92
best they could. I rapidly ticked off the names of my six best men as to the squad leaders.

1439
02:11:29.64 --> 02:11:34.04
I told them to have them on the trail behind the positions and I picked them up one by one and

1440
02:11:34.04 --> 02:11:38.76
moved toward the junction that led down to the valley below us. We tried to hurry and busted our

1441
02:11:38.76 --> 02:11:43.32
asses slipping and falling each over each other in the mud. We hit the flats and started across

1442
02:11:43.32 --> 02:11:49.24
the battalion heavy mortar section was in position. I asked the CEO to have canning notify them.

1443
02:11:49.24 --> 02:11:54.68
We were on the way and to be on the lookout for us. So I'm gonna say that again. We asked the CEO

1444
02:11:55.24 --> 02:11:59.48
to have canning notify them that we were on the way and to be on the lookout for us.

1445
02:12:01.08 --> 02:12:05.32
One or the other had failed and their guards opened up with small arms fire without bothering

1446
02:12:05.32 --> 02:12:12.36
to challenge us. Doomus went down dead. We dropped into a small gully and maneuvered toward the riverbed.

1447
02:12:12.36 --> 02:12:17.72
Our gun crew is still pouring the lead. We broke out of the gully 75 yards east of them

1448
02:12:17.72 --> 02:12:22.92
cop between their fire and the Chinese patrol. I yelled for the gun crew to hold fire and they did.

1449
02:12:22.92 --> 02:12:27.64
Now it was us and the patrol in the riverbed. I cautioned my men to play it cool to use bay

1450
02:12:27.64 --> 02:12:32.44
and that's where they could. No automatic fire under any circumstances. All automatic fire will

1451
02:12:32.44 --> 02:12:37.80
be considered enemy. We spread out and moved ahead slowly. The Chinese were in a panic. They

1452
02:12:37.80 --> 02:12:42.12
broke out of the niches and crevices in one of the in ones and twos and we dropped them with

1453
02:12:42.12 --> 02:12:49.16
singer file or laced a bayonet through their guts. First light broke and we had the sergeant

1454
02:12:49.16 --> 02:12:55.88
and the platoon leader trapped. They came out with their hands up. We marched them onto the valley

1455
02:12:55.88 --> 02:13:01.08
road and had them hunkered down with their hands clasped across the tops of their head. I left

1456
02:13:01.08 --> 02:13:08.20
the man to guard them and went back to take the tally. We had wiped out the patrol except for our

1457
02:13:08.20 --> 02:13:14.68
two prisoners. The deserters had told the truth. There had been 30 of them heavily armed but now

1458
02:13:14.68 --> 02:13:19.96
28 of them were dead. There were sporadic shots up ahead but nothing to get excited about.

1459
02:13:20.68 --> 02:13:25.88
I returned to the road then moved up to where I had posted my guard over the two POWs.

1460
02:13:27.48 --> 02:13:33.24
They were all dead. The men from the mortar crews had opened up on them with small arms.

1461
02:13:33.24 --> 02:13:40.20
I saw bloody red. I swung in the direction of the mortars and aimed my rifle from the hip.

1462
02:13:40.20 --> 02:13:43.64
One of their sergeants popped up. I'm sorry Herbert. We didn't know.

1463
02:13:45.40 --> 02:13:51.40
He dropped his carbine and raised his hands. We didn't know he apologized. No one told us.

1464
02:13:51.40 --> 02:14:01.08
I lowered my rifle. My fault. I said not yours.

1465
02:14:07.80 --> 02:14:13.08
So if you didn't quite catch that, the mortar company did not know that there was friendlies

1466
02:14:13.08 --> 02:14:17.72
around there and he had actually had captured these prisoners and he left the guard with them

1467
02:14:17.72 --> 02:14:25.000
and the mortar team killed them all. Both the captured enemy people and the guards.

1468
02:14:29.96 --> 02:14:36.20
And there you go. That's a extreme ownership. My fault not yours.

1469
02:14:36.20 --> 02:14:50.28
Blue on blue. Fast forward a little bit. We had received two replacements. One was named

1470
02:14:51.24 --> 02:14:55.96
a lieutenant named Manning. The other sergeant was killed by a single artillery round which dropped

1471
02:14:55.96 --> 02:15:00.36
into our positions that morning. No one in the unit except the CO had even heard his name.

1472
02:15:00.36 --> 02:15:05.88
Life was that dumb. War was stupid. If there was a god that he was stupid.

1473
02:15:07.72 --> 02:15:11.88
There was neither rhymed or reason to that man's death and he met no more than us

1474
02:15:11.88 --> 02:15:14.04
than a chunk of clay when we passed him on the way out.

1475
02:15:20.76 --> 02:15:27.000
Now I mentioned like for a split second that Fox company was headed up to this hill 868.

1476
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.48
And now these guys they didn't get there. Fox company didn't get a done. They took massive casualties

1477
02:15:33.48 --> 02:15:39.16
and now easy companies heading up there and they get pinned down in this one particular spot.

1478
02:15:40.44 --> 02:15:46.52
And well here they are. Manning caught up with me. What's happening? He asked excitedly.

1479
02:15:46.52 --> 02:15:50.44
I was in a crater. My back against the wall. There was no sense in doing anything until the mortar's

1480
02:15:50.44 --> 02:15:54.76
led up. There was no sense in getting excited either. I don't know Lieutenant. Why don't you

1481
02:15:54.76 --> 02:16:01.72
pop your head up and take a look and then tell me. I joked and he did it. The machine gun ripped off

1482
02:16:01.72 --> 02:16:06.92
a valley and he dropped back into my lap to round through the mouth in one cheek through the

1483
02:16:06.92 --> 02:16:13.32
tongue smashing some teeth and out on the other cheek. He was okay considering what it could have been.

1484
02:16:13.32 --> 02:16:19.16
My CO was next. He moved into the position with his radio with his radio man. What he

1485
02:16:19.16 --> 02:16:24.92
have up there. Her be asked mainly the machine gun sir will get it after it gets dark. That's

1486
02:16:24.92 --> 02:16:29.48
not good enough. He said the regimental CO is watching through the classes he wants it now.

1487
02:16:31.64 --> 02:16:36.52
Camey and turned to look at us. Then let that fucker come up and take it. He said.

1488
02:16:37.48 --> 02:16:42.44
Come on sir. I interrupted Fox companies been up here for weeks without moving all we need is a few more

1489
02:16:42.44 --> 02:16:48.76
hours. The 23rd is moving. His moving up the old man said we've got to have that hill today.

1490
02:16:50.84 --> 02:16:56.92
I rolled over on my gut and gave Camey in the signal to get ready. In the next four hours,

1491
02:16:56.92 --> 02:17:04.12
61 of us rounded that junction 11 of us made it two thirds of the way to the top along the final bar.

1492
02:17:04.12 --> 02:17:18.84
The machine gunner at the top of the hill got the rest. So night found 11 of us almost at the top

1493
02:17:19.48 --> 02:17:25.64
and the rest of us either cut their ribbons or unable to move. At three in the morning the

1494
02:17:25.64 --> 02:17:30.68
Chinese launched a counter attack down the ridge to drive us back, weeding us down to eight.

1495
02:17:30.68 --> 02:17:37.24
We still had radio contact with the CO and we wanted to know if we could hold out. We're not backing up.

1496
02:17:37.24 --> 02:17:43.88
I replied hang in there herb. I've got a 57 coming up. Hang in there. He was referring to a 57

1497
02:17:43.88 --> 02:17:49.48
caliber of 57 millimeter recoil as rifle. It could take out the machine gun all right, but it would

1498
02:17:49.48 --> 02:17:54.28
have to be a direct hit every half hour or so for the remainder of the night he called the check on

1499
02:17:54.28 --> 02:18:00.52
how we were making out. Just before daylight he joined us with the 57 and before we could stop him

1500
02:18:00.52 --> 02:18:06.84
he was through us and made a one man attack on the position. And he almost had it.

1501
02:18:08.12 --> 02:18:13.48
We gave him as much covering fire as we could, but just short of the position he went down pulling

1502
02:18:13.48 --> 02:18:18.76
the trigger of the 57. The round plowed into the sandbags right of the opening two feet off

1503
02:18:19.32 --> 02:18:24.60
total victory and blew the old man back down the hill. As overtake cattle which saved his life.

1504
02:18:24.60 --> 02:18:29.08
A call came in from the regiment. A platoon of fox company would push through us and take the final

1505
02:18:29.08 --> 02:18:37.72
bunker. Private Irvin Stern from North Dakota took two rounds through the chest.

1506
02:18:38.84 --> 02:18:43.08
He never even asked to be evacuated. He apologized for being a problem.

1507
02:18:44.68 --> 02:18:51.72
I could have hugged him. The platoon from fox company moved up to us. The lieutenant in charge wanted

1508
02:18:51.72 --> 02:19:00.92
to talk until it was time for the assault. So I listened. He had a wife and kids. He never expected

1509
02:19:00.92 --> 02:19:08.76
to make it. Pick and send you raw flash through my mind. He didn't intend to make it. But if he

1510
02:19:08.76 --> 02:19:15.80
didn't, someone else would have to. That someone was me with came in and the six we had left

1511
02:19:15.80 --> 02:19:19.80
and against a machine gunner with the determination and guts that that bastard had.

1512
02:19:19.80 --> 02:19:26.44
We weren't going to make it. So when the lieutenant moved his men out toward the peak,

1513
02:19:26.44 --> 02:19:34.52
I had my last troops stand. Stand ready to reinforce if necessary. As he stepped out to follow his

1514
02:19:34.52 --> 02:19:41.88
platoon, I cracked him with the butt of Jordan's car bean and raced out through his troops.

1515
02:19:41.88 --> 02:19:49.80
The gunner above, open fire and rape the hill, splattering dust and mud all around, round us.

1516
02:19:49.80 --> 02:19:53.88
Men began to fall back. I grabbed them and pushed them back up the hill. Get that mother fucker.

1517
02:19:53.88 --> 02:19:58.92
I shouted, get him. One of fox companies men shouted, okay, big deal. Let's get him.

1518
02:19:59.64 --> 02:20:06.68
And then raced to me. Came in was leading our own six up the ridge. Men started tossing grenades

1519
02:20:06.68 --> 02:20:11.88
from both sides and in the confusion one blew the gun away and we had the hill.

1520
02:20:14.60 --> 02:20:19.56
We had lost a buck who had been sent to the rear wounded and was captured down by the

1521
02:20:19.56 --> 02:20:26.20
brook by a Chinese patrol. Nelson was dead. The CO are top notch, black test case.

1522
02:20:27.80 --> 02:20:33.64
Manning, everyone in my platoon was either dead or wounded except came in to myself.

1523
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:39.56
Word came up that we would be relieved. Came in said it was about time.

1524
02:20:41.40 --> 02:20:45.88
Then he rolled over the body of one of our troops who had bought the farm the night before

1525
02:20:45.88 --> 02:20:52.04
and the grenade exploded. This war was getting to be real pain in the ass. We sat there,

1526
02:20:52.60 --> 02:20:58.12
him wounded now and only me in one piece waiting for our relief.

1527
02:20:58.12 --> 02:21:05.64
When the relief showed up, Roy could still walk, we moved back down the ridge line together.

1528
02:21:06.84 --> 02:21:12.28
One of the relief asked him who we were and he replied easy company 38th infantry.

1529
02:21:15.40 --> 02:21:19.88
At the west end of the valley, we caught up with those few troops from our company that hadn't been

1530
02:21:19.88 --> 02:21:31.16
committed and that had been moved back by the battalion CO. Maggie Higgins was interviewing them.

1531
02:21:31.16 --> 02:21:37.72
The battalion CO introduced me to her. She asked me to wait a moment while she concluded talking

1532
02:21:37.72 --> 02:21:42.76
with someone else. She turned her head and I walked off. I wasn't about to wait for anyone ever again.

1533
02:21:42.76 --> 02:21:48.12
Maggie's loss, I said to myself, turning back toward the Kansas line, I joined the remnants of

1534
02:21:48.12 --> 02:21:54.04
what had been easy company moving back up the hill out of the valley and away from hill 868.

1535
02:22:01.32 --> 02:22:07.88
Again, you think, okay, this got to be kind of the end. This has to be kind of the end of this

1536
02:22:09.08 --> 02:22:10.52
what he's going through.

1537
02:22:10.52 --> 02:22:19.16
I'm not sure if he can reflect on it as I was getting to know men.

1538
02:22:21.24 --> 02:22:26.92
Types were predictable and the world is becoming less complicated. There were men and there were

1539
02:22:26.92 --> 02:22:36.60
fakes. A man either was or he wasn't. The rest was all play acting. I was 21 and I was already an old

1540
02:22:36.60 --> 02:22:42.84
man. I had to shake it or I'd become a bona fide pain in the ass so I started to listen

1541
02:22:42.84 --> 02:22:51.24
more than I talked and was somewhat reserved with the men. The war felt different. There was no

1542
02:22:51.24 --> 02:22:55.88
apprehension, no excitement. Everything seemed routine and easy. I was going to make it unless

1543
02:22:55.88 --> 02:23:02.20
a stray roundhouse but had my name on it and that was damned unlikely. I'd become a survivor.

1544
02:23:02.20 --> 02:23:10.12
Some men lived and some men died. I would live. There was more than just war for me but for now

1545
02:23:10.12 --> 02:23:17.40
I was still in Korea. We were on the line and across the valley lay the next major objective.

1546
02:23:17.40 --> 02:23:20.76
I was ordered to report to battalion headquarters for briefing.

1547
02:23:20.76 --> 02:23:34.92
So you get done with an operation where every you lose everybody is either dead or wounded

1548
02:23:36.76 --> 02:23:40.20
and you achieve your objective and you get back in our next objective.

1549
02:23:40.20 --> 02:23:51.08
He does a little stint and it's going to get past his part of it. He does a little stint

1550
02:23:51.08 --> 02:23:55.96
with as a Marine Corps liaison and does an assault with the Marines and loses nine of the

1551
02:23:55.96 --> 02:24:00.76
Marines that he's with. And then after that he goes back to easy company again.

1552
02:24:04.60 --> 02:24:08.12
We returned to the same positions. We hadn't been pulled off of this back with easy company

1553
02:24:08.12 --> 02:24:13.40
and rain began to fall. I had been in Korea one year. Most men were rotating stateside within nine

1554
02:24:13.40 --> 02:24:18.20
months but I was still a wall. With no records I might be here forever. It was okay with me. I

1555
02:24:18.20 --> 02:24:22.44
knew the country. I knew the war and I was well on my way to knowing myself.

1556
02:24:25.16 --> 02:24:29.88
One day the war would end or else I'd go to stateside with a million dollar shot.

1557
02:24:29.88 --> 02:24:33.72
Either way I'd be thankful. I'd never again waste a moment of life.

1558
02:24:33.72 --> 02:24:40.04
And no one ever again would be able to take even a second of it from me.

1559
02:24:42.52 --> 02:24:49.000
I felt terrific. Screw rotation. Life was my orster. Korea was my pearl.

1560
02:24:57.56 --> 02:25:02.60
Going back out on another patrol. We crossed the road and started up a hill.

1561
02:25:02.60 --> 02:25:07.88
Complex beyond the fog lifting beneath behind in beneath us. The world was still calm.

1562
02:25:08.76 --> 02:25:13.96
We picked our way carefully. Slightly I stopped the ones and glanced back. I felt damn good. I felt

1563
02:25:13.96 --> 02:25:19.88
proud. I felt American goddammit. We were the best. Just off the peak. They had a major gun position.

1564
02:25:20.52 --> 02:25:24.76
A Russian heavy machine gun. Two crew members were standing outside shooting the breeze.

1565
02:25:24.76 --> 02:25:29.24
Having a smoke I gave a signal for the patrol to fan out on both sides of the trail. I wanted

1566
02:25:29.24 --> 02:25:35.48
those two taken silently and alive. I motioned for the two scouts to cover me. Then just as I was

1567
02:25:35.48 --> 02:25:40.60
about to start forward to take them someone triggered a booby trap. Both crew members made a

1568
02:25:40.60 --> 02:25:46.04
break for their bunker and I had to drop them. So much for surprise. We still had shock action.

1569
02:25:48.52 --> 02:25:55.80
And we were at the top in their positions with their key guns and most of their ammo. In

1570
02:25:55.80 --> 02:26:02.04
effect we had the hill. We could hold it as long. We could hold it long enough for George

1571
02:26:02.04 --> 02:26:07.80
company to reinforce. Then nobody was going to take it back. So I had to skip some stuff because

1572
02:26:07.80 --> 02:26:12.60
it's a pretty detailed explanation of what's going on. But basically they were kind of head

1573
02:26:12.60 --> 02:26:17.40
up this into this position and they almost get fully in the position. They get close enough

1574
02:26:17.40 --> 02:26:22.44
to where they're going to be able to actually capture the people that are in that gun without

1575
02:26:22.44 --> 02:26:28.44
giving themselves away. But somebody you can hear somebody hit the booby trap. But once the

1576
02:26:28.44 --> 02:26:31.64
booby trap goes they just kind of continue with the assault. They don't get the kill the guys instead

1577
02:26:31.64 --> 02:26:36.20
of capturing them but they get there. And they capture this freaking hill. And this hill

1578
02:26:36.20 --> 02:26:41.64
didn't really go too much into it but it's a very prominent terrain feature. And so it's

1579
02:26:41.64 --> 02:26:50.76
surprising that they get there. And he says at the end there we could hold the hill long enough for

1580
02:26:50.76 --> 02:26:56.28
George company to reinforce. And once George company was there they would have the hill and

1581
02:26:56.28 --> 02:27:03.96
known to be able to take it from them. But George company never showed. By late afternoon there were

1582
02:27:03.96 --> 02:27:08.36
six of us still alive and we could hardly see over the dead around us. Every time I called the

1583
02:27:08.36 --> 02:27:14.20
Italian I got word that George company was almost to us hang on. Randolph was reloading magazines

1584
02:27:14.20 --> 02:27:20.84
into the B.A.R. They're not common serge. We're almost out of ammo. Get the old man on the horn.

1585
02:27:20.84 --> 02:27:26.28
I'd give it one more try. He wasn't available according to the radio man. I glassed back down the

1586
02:27:26.28 --> 02:27:31.88
trail we'd come up so skillfully. So easily so damn sure of ourselves that Chinese must find it

1587
02:27:31.88 --> 02:27:38.20
unbelievable that we hadn't reinforced yet. They didn't know we were down to six almost out of ammo.

1588
02:27:39.64 --> 02:27:43.64
If we made a break now and Rand like hell we might be able to make it before they would close

1589
02:27:43.64 --> 02:27:49.80
in on us. I sent one final message. Tell the old man we're pulling out. Then without waiting for a

1590
02:27:49.80 --> 02:27:55.64
Roger any other bullshit like I'd been getting all day I gave the word to saddle up. They stared at

1591
02:27:55.64 --> 02:28:01.32
me in disbelief. What about George company? There isn't any George company. Now God damn it pack

1592
02:28:01.32 --> 02:28:07.48
up and get ready to move. Add a dud round down the trail. Nobody stops until he crosses the road.

1593
02:28:08.28 --> 02:28:13.56
Then hold up and provide cover for the rest of us. Ready? I destroyed the maximum

1594
02:28:13.56 --> 02:28:21.88
and picked up our own LMG. I began to tick off names. Keith go Nick go Daniels go Thompson go.

1595
02:28:22.68 --> 02:28:28.60
I turned to Randolph go and we were halfway down the hill before they called on

1596
02:28:30.04 --> 02:28:33.64
that it wasn't a diversion or another tactic but that we were bugging out.

1597
02:28:34.44 --> 02:28:39.000
I took a round through the fleshy part of my calf. Randolph took one through the chest and

1598
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:45.08
a second through the head. He was dead before he hit the ground. Everyone else made it across the road

1599
02:28:45.08 --> 02:28:49.24
without a scratch. Then held up and covered for me while I got Randolph's body out.

1600
02:28:50.60 --> 02:28:55.80
I was puffing like a winded horse. I'm sorry.

1601
02:28:58.28 --> 02:29:05.08
Four of them. I'm just fucking sorry. They would have to be crazy to ever trust me again. Thompson

1602
02:29:05.08 --> 02:29:12.76
padded me on the shoulder. You ain't George company, Sarge. But it wasn't George company either.

1603
02:29:12.76 --> 02:29:19.48
They had never been alerted for standby. No one had believed we could ever make it to the top

1604
02:29:19.48 --> 02:29:25.64
and then when we did they didn't think we could ever hold out all day. The new S2 at the Betayan

1605
02:29:25.64 --> 02:29:31.64
tried to explain to me that George company would get the hill back tomorrow. If the troll of

1606
02:29:31.64 --> 02:29:38.28
24 could do it, it would be a cinch for a full company. He was green so we really believed it.

1607
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:46.20
It wasn't even worth explaining. I'd been dealing with assholes like him on and off for almost a

1608
02:29:46.20 --> 02:29:51.48
year now. I went over to the aid station and had them tend to my wound. The regimental CO had

1609
02:29:51.48 --> 02:29:58.04
be back to the rear again the same night and apologized. No one had notified him that we'd made

1610
02:29:58.04 --> 02:30:04.36
it to the top. He was sorry about my troops. But I had brought back valuable intelligence.

1611
02:30:04.36 --> 02:30:11.32
Now the hill would be easy. I tried to explain what was really on that hill that neither George

1612
02:30:11.32 --> 02:30:15.96
company nor the entire betayan was going to take it now. We had blown our chance. You're just

1613
02:30:15.96 --> 02:30:27.32
hurt Herbert. You'll see. And we saw George company was chopped the pieces. The battalion failed.

1614
02:30:28.36 --> 02:30:34.84
The 38th Regiment failed. They had to bring in the ninth regiment, part of the 23rd Regiment,

1615
02:30:34.84 --> 02:30:41.88
the French battalion and part of the 14th Regiment. The battle raged for four weeks. We lost nearly

1616
02:30:41.88 --> 02:30:48.84
5,600 men, 1900 dead, 3700 seriously wounded before it was secured.

1617
02:30:51.24 --> 02:31:00.04
Harkbreak Ridge. We could have had it for free. And it would have gone unnamed and unremembered

1618
02:31:00.04 --> 02:31:03.56
except for one commander who had not believed in his troops.

1619
02:31:03.56 --> 02:31:11.64
A couple of days later, halfway up another hill I was ordered to turn my platoon over to my

1620
02:31:11.64 --> 02:31:17.000
assistant and report back to company headquarters where I was provided with a Jeep to regiment

1621
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:22.52
bypassing Italian, another Jeep to division and on the sole 8th Army headquarters.

1622
02:31:24.28 --> 02:31:31.72
So you've heard Hamburg or Hill, then in this crazy battle and you got the casualties right there,

1623
02:31:31.72 --> 02:31:40.36
1,93700 seriously wounded and they had taken the hill before it had been reinforced.

1624
02:31:44.44 --> 02:31:51.56
So you can see he's got this, this is a provided with these jeeps back to battalion, back to

1625
02:31:51.56 --> 02:32:03.000
regiment, back to division and then all the way back to sole where the 8th Army headquarters is.

1626
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:09.48
This is what happens. We wield into sole and into the compound. Everyone was in class A's except

1627
02:32:09.48 --> 02:32:14.28
myself and the Jeep driver. I'd never been this far to the rear in my life, not even in the states.

1628
02:32:14.28 --> 02:32:20.44
The MP at the gauge gates checked our identification then stood back and saluted.

1629
02:32:22.04 --> 02:32:29.64
What the hell gave him the idea of us? We're officers. I couldn't figure, but to save time I returned it.

1630
02:32:29.64 --> 02:32:35.08
Your quarters are at number 8 Sergeant Herbert over there. He pointed at a building across the compound.

1631
02:32:35.08 --> 02:32:39.40
Well, at least he knew I was a sergeant. I hadn't asked the driver for his rank. Thanks,

1632
02:32:39.40 --> 02:32:47.16
Corpal. I replied, then turn to the driver. You staying I asked a hostage. A hostage got to get back.

1633
02:32:48.04 --> 02:32:53.16
Save you time then. I jumped out of the Jeep and lit next to the Corpal. Take your bag

1634
02:32:53.16 --> 02:32:58.36
serge, don't have any sun. I was 21. I turned back the Jeep driver. Thanks. It's an honor,

1635
02:32:58.36 --> 02:33:04.76
serge. He saluted me off handedly, spun the Jeep around and a cloud of dust and brought back through the gate.

1636
02:33:04.76 --> 02:33:10.04
He disappeared up the road in a second. Later in the afternoon after a good bath and washing some of the

1637
02:33:10.04 --> 02:33:15.96
filth out of my fatigues, I saw it out the NCO club. It wasn't open yet. So I went back to my room, took another

1638
02:33:15.96 --> 02:33:25.08
back bath and fell asleep. I had a terrible dream. It was one which would re-accur for years.

1639
02:33:26.76 --> 02:33:31.24
I was charging a machine gun nest, not a bunker, but one in a hole.

1640
02:33:31.24 --> 02:33:41.88
Like the one at Kun Mun Gaul. Then with bayonet fixed out of ammo, right on the edge, the earth gave

1641
02:33:41.88 --> 02:33:48.68
way beneath my feet and I was going backwards. My guts unguarded. My rifle flung up in an attempt to

1642
02:33:48.68 --> 02:33:56.36
re-gain my balance. But I was going over backwards and I woke up in a sweat.

1643
02:33:56.36 --> 02:34:03.80
I got a hold of myself in a second. Sorrow I was and laid down and went back to sleep to be awakened

1644
02:34:04.44 --> 02:34:11.24
next by light footsteps at my door. It was a young lieutenant. Everything sat as factory sergeant.

1645
02:34:11.24 --> 02:34:16.20
He asked cheerfully. Great, sir, but why all the service? What the hell is it all about?

1646
02:34:18.36 --> 02:34:23.72
It was just what he needed to trigger him off. The UN command had decided to send two outstanding

1647
02:34:23.72 --> 02:34:29.64
soldiers from the command on a goodwill tour of Europe, state side, god knows where else.

1648
02:34:30.36 --> 02:34:37.000
Our best, he said. Another soldier of the month contest I thought. I remember the MP at the gate

1649
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:44.84
in the classies and glanced at myself in the mirror. I was ragged, asked, and tired. I didn't have

1650
02:34:44.84 --> 02:34:50.60
a chance and I didn't much give a damn. I was beyond that. I rushed the lieutenant out, took another

1651
02:34:50.60 --> 02:34:57.40
bath, dressed, slung my B.A.R., and closed the door behind me. All I had to do was hit another

1652
02:34:57.40 --> 02:35:03.80
and ride north, and I'd be back to easy company within two days. The corporal was still at the gate.

1653
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:11.64
Where you headed? Serge, he asked, home, man. Home? Back to my outfit.

1654
02:35:13.16 --> 02:35:17.08
But Serge, hey man, do I look like soldier of the month material I asked?

1655
02:35:17.08 --> 02:35:23.64
He shook his head in the nicest way any human being ever had before or since.

1656
02:35:25.24 --> 02:35:31.000
Ah, Serge, you look like the toughest mother that's over here, and our most decorated soldier.

1657
02:35:33.16 --> 02:35:38.60
He had tears in his eyes. You're going out, man. They're taking a guy to go with you.

1658
02:35:38.60 --> 02:35:45.24
He lifted the rifle from my shoulder, and you ain't going to need this anymore.

1659
02:35:52.36 --> 02:36:01.96
So, that is a good place to stop for this particular book.

1660
02:36:01.96 --> 02:36:10.92
For this pretty much where there's an Apple Log that you should read. But the story ends there for this

1661
02:36:10.92 --> 02:36:20.52
book, but as they end the book, but it's not the end of the story. And I won't even crack open this

1662
02:36:20.52 --> 02:36:29.32
next book yet, which is going to pick up with what happens throughout his life and his career

1663
02:36:29.32 --> 02:36:38.92
in the army after Korea. After some mayhem in Vietnam, we're going to learn a lot about leadership,

1664
02:36:38.92 --> 02:36:44.60
a lot about life, a lot about human nature, and go ahead and learn some lessons.

1665
02:36:45.48 --> 02:36:55.88
So, we will save that for next time to prevent having a seven hour podcast at this time.

1666
02:36:55.88 --> 02:37:03.24
Until then, echo, speaking of life. Crazy story, right? Crazy story. I mean insane.

1667
02:37:07.24 --> 02:37:14.68
Like unreal. Right. Like it's not real. It's so crazy and unbelievable.

1668
02:37:15.88 --> 02:37:23.24
It's like time and time and time again. How many nine lives for a cat? What's he on?

1669
02:37:23.24 --> 02:37:30.12
I think he's on 17. It's crazy how he has that much. I don't even know what you'd call it. Where

1670
02:37:31.40 --> 02:37:39.08
he's just down for the fight. Just to be like, I guess though, right? Like when you're, when you grow

1671
02:37:39.08 --> 02:37:50.44
up, just hard core mining town, no, just hard. You see your brothers go off to war. You see them

1672
02:37:50.44 --> 02:37:55.64
coming home, telling stories about what's going on. Just embed it. Is there, right? There's like

1673
02:37:55.64 --> 02:38:05.08
embedded desire to be in war for many young men, right? And I can't say everybody, I want to

1674
02:38:05.08 --> 02:38:10.52
make that statement. I can't talk about females because I don't interact with females as much,

1675
02:38:10.52 --> 02:38:16.28
but like when you're in a single platoon, you're with a lot of guys that what they wanted to do

1676
02:38:16.28 --> 02:38:23.80
growing up was go to war. Myself included. Like that's what you grow up with. So there's got to be

1677
02:38:23.80 --> 02:38:31.48
some kind of instinctual thing. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean, maybe over simplifying it would be like,

1678
02:38:31.48 --> 02:38:39.96
that's his 100% purpose in life. Yeah. So yeah, whatever I get band-edged a million times,

1679
02:38:39.96 --> 02:38:46.20
shot, blown up, shot again, failed. Yeah. This guy lets you down. There's group lets you down, higher up,

1680
02:38:46.20 --> 02:38:53.24
slating you down, shot up again. And okay, like let me, let me literally break the law.

1681
02:38:55.40 --> 02:39:00.04
Many times, by the way, to get back to war. You don't know, it's as crazy. So he's there for a year.

1682
02:39:01.32 --> 02:39:05.64
Now imagine this, the one guy that he talks about, this sergeant shows up, his first day gets killed.

1683
02:39:05.64 --> 02:39:13.24
They don't even know what his name is. So here's a guy that's going 365 days of front line.

1684
02:39:13.24 --> 02:39:21.40
Someone else shows up and they're dead in an hour. Yeah. Man, I mean, he can't, I'm listening to

1685
02:39:21.40 --> 02:39:25.56
the book and I'm like, Brad, this guy's going to die soon. You know, obviously he doesn't die,

1686
02:39:25.56 --> 02:39:32.20
but you can't if that's how it feels. It's like, man, he just keeps going back. That's crazy, man.

1687
02:39:32.20 --> 02:39:39.80
Um, in the beginning, it had, you know, that graphic tail of the guts. Yeah. You know,

1688
02:39:39.80 --> 02:39:46.60
wow, that does that to somebody. I can, you know, they obviously capture them and they just,

1689
02:39:46.60 --> 02:39:50.92
what, cut them open and let their gut and then hang them up. Like, how can you even do that?

1690
02:39:52.52 --> 02:40:00.20
Hell, baffling. Beats, dual tuments, it's human beings. Yeah, that's right. The, the darkness.

1691
02:40:00.20 --> 02:40:09.000
Yeah, but, I don't know. Man, no, but straight up. Yeah, I know, but, you know, as far as like

1692
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.68
our perspective, you know, like, I guess maybe you could get talked through it, like, you know,

1693
02:40:14.68 --> 02:40:18.68
you hear about these crazy things that people do, right? Whether it be to each other or whatever.

1694
02:40:18.68 --> 02:40:22.36
And you kind of hear everything. You're like, I can see how he got there. I would never do that.

1695
02:40:22.36 --> 02:40:25.16
Can stop, but I can see how he got there. You can kind of be like, I see, I see.

1696
02:40:25.16 --> 02:40:31.32
It's hard like that kind of stuff to be like, yeah, this person, we captured them already.

1697
02:40:32.76 --> 02:40:37.48
I mean, maybe certain angry, like, if you're angry enough, it's a money, maybe, but I'm

1698
02:40:37.48 --> 02:40:41.48
well, what's in here's a good, here's a good example of thought processes when he

1699
02:40:42.68 --> 02:40:48.04
is when he gets told, hey, go burn down that village. Yeah, and he goes, I'm not doing it. Yeah.

1700
02:40:48.04 --> 02:40:52.44
Now, think about this. He says, I'm not doing it. And another guy's, all right, I'll do it.

1701
02:40:52.44 --> 02:40:55.88
So the other guy goes out to burn down the village and he gets shot in the chest and killed.

1702
02:40:58.12 --> 02:41:03.40
And now, you can see Captain West is like, hey, now do you want to go burn down the village?

1703
02:41:04.68 --> 02:41:08.44
And you would think you could, you would think Captain West is sort of trying to take advantage

1704
02:41:08.44 --> 02:41:12.76
of the anger that you would have. Yeah, like, let's get some revenge. Yeah. And he goes, no.

1705
02:41:13.48 --> 02:41:18.84
So that shows what his character is like. And again, the idea of this character,

1706
02:41:18.84 --> 02:41:22.92
and the reason I talking about it a lot is when you see when we get to what happens in Vietnam,

1707
02:41:24.04 --> 02:41:30.76
there's a lot of his character, you have to try and understand his character because of accusations

1708
02:41:30.76 --> 02:41:38.28
that are being made in all different directions. It's, yeah. And it's weird to like,

1709
02:41:39.16 --> 02:41:48.76
any one of these actions that he did is so far off the charts of what, what's a

1710
02:41:48.76 --> 02:41:56.04
what's expected to like a normal award writing above and beyond. With complete disregard for

1711
02:41:56.04 --> 02:42:00.76
his own safety, like all those things, that's, that's what he's got going on. Yeah.

1712
02:42:01.40 --> 02:42:09.32
Crazy man. Well, back to the path. Well, I was going to say speaking of human nature, we know that

1713
02:42:09.32 --> 02:42:19.80
we as humans have a tendency to drift off the path. So maybe we need a little. Yeah.

1714
02:42:19.80 --> 02:42:25.08
Yeah. Well, you know, a wise man once said, um, it's hard to stand the path.

1715
02:42:26.28 --> 02:42:31.80
Once you slip off, it may seem hard to get back on. But you can do it.

1716
02:42:33.08 --> 02:42:37.96
What do you recommend? Well, there's good news. Because you're not alone on the path.

1717
02:42:37.96 --> 02:42:43.48
Yeah. You might feel like it. But you got some help. Same saying. Help through supplementation.

1718
02:42:43.48 --> 02:42:50.60
Yep. I said it. So, okay. So we're working out. That's a big one. We already know that it

1719
02:42:50.60 --> 02:42:58.04
it helps every element of your life. I'm just getting in shape, being in shape. It's funny that

1720
02:42:58.04 --> 02:43:03.08
I keep getting reminded. I think I mentioned this before. Obviously, I'm not going to go too deep into it.

1721
02:43:03.08 --> 02:43:08.12
Because it really pales in comparison to pretty much anything we've ever talked about ever. But

1722
02:43:09.16 --> 02:43:13.000
it doesn't mean it's not. The groceries are well. It's not. It's not. It's very close. So,

1723
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:19.16
you know, the water jugs. Right. I said, I told you about this similar similar situation, but

1724
02:43:19.16 --> 02:43:22.84
same thought process. So, you know, water jugs, right? The big five gallon ones. It's not on the

1725
02:43:22.84 --> 02:43:28.76
cooler and stuff like that. So I was replacing mine at home. And you got bayonet? No. No,

1726
02:43:28.76 --> 02:43:33.56
better bayonet. I definitely didn't. No, I did not. It was white phosphorus burning you to the bone.

1727
02:43:33.56 --> 02:43:42.76
I did not. But I had to grab it off like this shelf. See, Rowan, you put it like that. You're going

1728
02:43:42.76 --> 02:43:47.40
to take away the juice of the hose. Oh, as you left up, you got shot. No. Then the bullet wrapped around

1729
02:43:47.40 --> 02:43:54.20
your bone. No, no, bullets in you. Do that. But I saw it. And the thing is like, what? Like 40 pounds?

1730
02:43:54.20 --> 02:43:59.56
I think it's like eight pounds per gallon, right? Yeah. I think. Yeah. So, 40 pounds, boom.

1731
02:43:59.56 --> 02:44:04.68
And you have to kind of let it drop. Mm-hmm. And so I got to try and find. You were in my field.

1732
02:44:06.04 --> 02:44:10.36
No, so you can't just like, and I did it with one hand because that's something else in

1733
02:44:10.36 --> 02:44:15.40
my hand because I was doing some other stuff at the same time. So, it drops. And I swing it almost

1734
02:44:15.40 --> 02:44:19.40
like a kettlebell. You know, you got to catch the momentum and swing it and boom. And boom,

1735
02:44:19.40 --> 02:44:24.60
40 pounds big thing too, by the way. So I bring it up and I'm walking with it in one hand and

1736
02:44:24.60 --> 02:44:30.12
I forget what I had in the other hand. I was doing some field. And I walked it over and I was thinking

1737
02:44:30.12 --> 02:44:38.52
to myself, it's kind of good to have this kid. Right. You're over making, like, making the

1738
02:44:38.52 --> 02:44:43.80
comparison even more contrasty. So it's making it like sound all lame. But don't you think about it

1739
02:44:43.80 --> 02:44:48.04
for sure? I'm telling you what you think about it. It's way better to have that capability

1740
02:44:48.04 --> 02:44:55.08
than not to. You seem to be able to handle the 40 pound thing. Under like, I don't

1741
02:44:55.08 --> 02:44:59.80
want to say harder circumstances, but harder than normal. You seem to say. Yeah. It's almost like,

1742
02:44:59.80 --> 02:45:04.60
you know, having to grab a wounded major. Yeah. Is your being over running, having to throw him

1743
02:45:04.60 --> 02:45:10.60
over your shoulder. Good point. Okay. That's that capability. Yes. Yes. Or just keep a water jug.

1744
02:45:10.60 --> 02:45:15.56
Or what have you? Okay. Perfect. So that's the point. The point is, hey, sometimes you got to

1745
02:45:15.56 --> 02:45:19.16
know, why do you do this to yourself? Don't worry. You're doing it too. I'm not doing it.

1746
02:45:19.16 --> 02:45:22.60
Yeah. You're doing it too. Yes. Pointing out what every single other person is. They can

1747
02:45:22.60 --> 02:45:27.96
keep you. Anyway, if you got to say somebody, you know, and you got to put them on your shoulder

1748
02:45:27.96 --> 02:45:34.28
and run them. Yep. With a big cross street or whatever, it's good to have that capability

1749
02:45:34.28 --> 02:45:39.32
rather than, oh, shoot. I can't do it by myself. I got asked for help. Seems like. Check. Same thing

1750
02:45:39.32 --> 02:45:43.72
with the water jug. Check. If someone needs some help, like, hey, you know, you know, the kind

1751
02:45:43.72 --> 02:45:47.16
of your grandma or whatever is like, hey, can you help me? Can you grab that thing up there?

1752
02:45:47.16 --> 02:45:51.80
You know, the water jug from on the shelf. You want to be the guy that they asked to help,

1753
02:45:51.80 --> 02:45:56.36
because they know we can do it. You seem to say. Yes, bro. Hey, look, I'll let you out of this.

1754
02:45:56.36 --> 02:46:01.000
Here's your out. We're not in Korea. Here's your out. Here's your out. You take it.

1755
02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.76
Anyway, I totally respect that. You want to help grandma. Yeah. And whoever else needs help. And that's

1756
02:46:06.76 --> 02:46:10.84
not to mention when you're by yourself, you don't got to ask for help because you can do it.

1757
02:46:10.84 --> 02:46:15.16
Same thing. Okay. I'm just saying, if you have that option, like it's better to choose

1758
02:46:15.16 --> 02:46:20.92
option where you have that capability is what I'm saying. I agree. So that's why one of the many

1759
02:46:20.92 --> 02:46:28.60
infinite reasons why working out is important. Okay. I'm correct. I'm going. You are correct.

1760
02:46:28.60 --> 02:46:33.56
Anyway, when you're working out, sometimes you get little little pains in your joints,

1761
02:46:34.44 --> 02:46:39.88
which is no problem when you're listening to the best of that. That would induce pain as well

1762
02:46:39.88 --> 02:46:45.24
for sure, for sure. But no worries, Jaco is supplement for these things. Not the bandet thing, obviously.

1763
02:46:45.24 --> 02:46:50.44
But, you know, little pains in your joints. That kind of stuff. Join warfare. It's called Jaco.

1774
02:47:45.08 --> 02:47:51.48
everybody already knows. But you bring up a good point from time to time that what if like 85

1775
02:47:51.48 --> 02:47:55.88
percent of people already know? Same same. Yeah. And then I'm like, okay, I'm accommodating the other,

1776
02:47:55.88 --> 02:48:02.36
the, you know, the 15 percent and kind of in a way, in a way, kind of ignoring the 85 percent,

1777
02:48:02.36 --> 02:48:06.60
the needs of the 85 percent could be. Same same. Making them go for that right as well.

1778
02:48:07.32 --> 02:48:11.96
No matter how good that right is. Yeah. Exactly right. Right. So I did what's face at that right.

02:54:21.96 --> 02:54:27.96
number of explosions on long videos. You know what Charles makes. Origin USA, that's main tie. Right?

1840
02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:41.48
he doesn't have the skill set. That's that. That's that. That's that. Maybe it's because he

1841
02:54:41.48 --> 02:54:49.72
maybe it's because he is uses some discretion when he make his videos. Yeah, it's very possible. Yeah.

1844
02:55:03.40 --> 02:55:08.76
I just realized since I just got done with the warrior kid, I just realized probably a year ago.

1845
02:55:08.76 --> 02:55:14.36
I said, it'll make some more psychological warfare for everybody. Haven't done it. Yeah. Well,

1846
02:55:14.36 --> 02:55:22.92
you got to kind of collect or think of or kind of mentally get a current weakness. The thing is,

1847
02:55:22.92 --> 02:55:29.88
though, as people were so stoked on that album and gave such good feedback. And I think I was just like,

1848
02:55:29.88 --> 02:55:33.80
oh, yeah, I won't. People were asking, I can do interest in that. And I didn't really. I was like,

pump, you know? And then the prioritized next season. Oh, dang. Started to start. Other things started

get a good. There you go. Literally, motivation will not get that. It's only discipline.
