hey you know intersection I think it was two nine three two nine three which would have like double digit cigarettes a day and we're realizing hey what's probably go a different way or go through this alleyway and reviewing the satellite imagery to see and understanding and trying to go through do like a dirt dive which is just space was just planning the route in your head and seeing what kind of obstacles you might see or landmarks because GPS wasn't super reliable at the time especially since we had jammers you'll want on 24 seven so that people couldn't remotely detonate ideas we'd try and jam all all frequencies so a lot of times you didn't have GPS so you need to know the route cold and then as a point man being able to take to dismount safely and then guide your platoon to the target on foot and that also takes careful route planning careful route study and making sure you get the right target because I mean you can have pretty bad consequences when you hit the right hit the wrong target and of course your shooter just like everyone everyone's a shooter from the lowest and listed to the OIC is a shooter is responsible for their lanes for engaging the enemy for a turning fire for being a shooter and once you're on target if this is happens to be an overwatch we'd set up the night before and set up sniper overwatch positions so that we had good observations of different angles different lanes that the enemy might try and use to attack us or worse attack our brethren our army and marine corps brothers and sisters who might be doing a route clearance or might be doing a patrol and that's just like one flavor of the many different types of missions that we did you know we talked about DA direct action missions those were a little more direct you know you probably just drive up this and require as much I guess you know trying to be as seraptitious it's kind of going in loud you're not feeling anyone you're going loud aggressive hard and I didn't I wasn't always good at it you know because sometimes you're fed up like mustering a 0 500 when the muster is really like 0 700 like why am I here for 2 hours because you know maybe the squallie to put 15 minutes of grace time before like the company commander before the fake you know like rotsy leader or whatever and then eventually works out there you're like 2 hours before you're there standing there 2 hours of attention before you need to be there you know like little things like that and for some especially I saw some former enlisted having a really hard time keeping their thoughts to themselves team guys are even worse so my program the seaming animal program did not take into consideration the program where you stay in listed and there wasn't because it wasn't a good route it just wasn't considered because the time of the instruction was written that in listed program wasn't written and I wanted to apply to that on the program but was being told by my my you know my superiors at the rots unit that I couldn't do it because of the instruction and that's I'm for I am not I am not a believer in circumventing the chain of command and in this case I let my who's a lieutenant like proctor let him know like I'd like to see if I can pursue this avenue and a parallel path and trying to get approval for this and the response I got was a good luck and that's when I reached out to you and told you the situation and you asked a specific officer who I still actually keep in touch with because I remember he did not know who I was but the very fact that we were both from the same brotherhood from teams that he went out of his way and he was working I think in buepers or some personnel command that had access to these types to the people that can make these types of decisions and he was able to secure or at least share this story what I was going through to the right people and once those right people heard the situation is like well that's easy of course it just wasn't it wasn't considered because it's a clerical thing not because it's not like shouldn't be allowed so once the right people heard the story that I I think I could have done better at what point did you decide maybe going into space would be a good idea so we talked about accidents and we call whatever we want I have no plan I had no plan to do any of these things I we talked about I had no plan to be a doctor it's just something that came out of deployment of a body of seeing the compassion and the good that physicians and nurses were doing to our brothers and sisters who were wounded in combat and I wanted to be able to do that type of good as well and that's why I directed to medicine space was never on the horizon we talked a little bit about where I came from that scared little boy and grew up under my father shadow I never thought I could have been a seal or a doctor or an astronaut there's no way it was a different life and I was a different person and the first time I heard about NASA and this opportunity I don't I don't have a great story for it it's just I heard about being national and it's like that's kind of interesting when we're like other than space exploration like what you do and learning about the impact that national arts can have on our next generation and what Apollo did for our country I mean in the 60s we were able to land a human on the moon with that technology despite a growing race with Russia and all the politics going on during that era Kennedy's assassination we were able to complete that and that secured American preeminence in science technology for decades to come I certainly believe that and the benefits we got from that are you can't count that and learning a little bit more about that and how astronauts have had the opportunity to represent humanity for good and bring together countries in a way that politics and alliances cannot do when you talk to some of the Apollo astronauts who landed on the moon and they did their international travel the comment the feedback they would get from people would be we did it but some of the hardest years of my life because it was different I couldn't grind through it by just hitting harder with the way this is going from university San Diego to Harvard or just going from the team so you're just going okay at transition it was some of the hardest years of my life because it's not like you could just push through like you can in some of the things you do in the bloods or in teams and the bloods is a challenge but as you and I know training is nothing compared to war but you think training is hard you think how weak is hard it's hard right until you get hit in the face in a real combat operation and then you realize oh I've reset my benchmark for what is hard or what is painful or what is suffering and even having that benchmark going into transitioning to civilian life it was hard for me I was trying to fit in four year degree in three years trying to do really well because I knew I had a good grades to be considered for a school like Harvard I had my first child I was working part time but probably the worst of it was I was not right in the head with my decompression with post war I took a lot of that anger and hatred my heart and I still had it there and you know I had you know no power but the people that people that you know and the relationship that you build over time is like hey guys here's what's going on and the guys that are in powerful positions or in the right position and the right spot with the right poll can make things happen and and they do it for the right reasons why like just like you said it wasn't because it wasn't the right thing was absolutely the right thing to do it's like he's not getting you know rassed by the troops people aren't making fun of him for this that or the other thing that's when you that's when you know a guy's a real problem is when he's actually so far outside that's spectrum that they go you know what we don't even we don't even want to we don't even want to do that with this guy because he's not one of us and we don't want him as part of the team wise words I've always heard that I believe it if if you weren't getting rattle if you weren't being made fun of then people didn't like you and that's just the coach I think it's hard for people outside of that community to understand why we were so hard in each other and why it was born out of love it really is it's a a lot of those actions and you just the way we conducted ourselves and I mean some of the people closest friends we were just you know just dog on each other all the time to this day but you know so many emotions when you show up your petoni like a lot of guys I was just so hungry to be accepted to be a good job like look I can put out I'm gonna ask it like I want to be here because I want to be here and getting welcome like that was I I wanted that and it's a different world I feel like I was fortunate enough to see two sides of the Navy because that is certainly not at all condoning that behavior but it is what it is it is what it was and I've kind of at the cost where I got to see that side of the teams and I'm sure it's still those on but it's changed a little bit right yep you're learning it's kind of like SKT you're learning the basics of what it's like to be an effective astronaut but that training never goes away like just like being a seal you don't stop shooting just because you made it through SKT it's just the beginning of your of your learning of your professional development and you're maintaining all of that so you continue all of those activities maintain speaking your Russian practicing in the space you'd flying in a jet you know weekly and then supporting on going mission so if you're not assigned which I am not assigned I mean there's a pool of astronaut that are always supporting on going missions because that's a priority is supporting on going missions and right now we have astronauts that have man the international space station for 20 years continuously there are people adult where we have been orbiting in man presence in the space station one of the people have been alive and we are looking to go back to the moon in 2024 with our eyes set for deeper exploration two Mars in beyond it was we did it and that was powerful that countries could come together and see that as a human accomplishment so there's something about space that takes away those borders because when you're up there you don't see these distinct borders between countries you just see a lot of blue and a lot of land and you see how fragile the planet is so once I learned a little bit about that type of impact and that you can have a huge impact on the next generation of explorers of scientists of people who want to be a better version of themselves maybe I could reach out to those kids just like me who are scared tired who don't think they can amount to anything who don't think they're worth anything if I could reach out to them and let them know that hey doesn't matter where you're from with the right attitude with the right hard work if you get up every time you fail you can amount to something and you can do positive work you can leave a good impact a positive mark for our world that meant a lot to me and that's when I put my name in the hat and wanted to be a nationalot because it was completely consistent with my goals that I promised Mikey Mark Ryan long list of our brothers who are not here with us today that I would for the rest of my life do something to impact positive good in our world is it um was it is there a recruiter that comes around I mean where did you dare pick up a brochure in class where did you you must have the idea get you must have been watching you know a movie or something and gone so that was huge huge learning for me and I'm very thankful that I had the years that in going to college are working in a different line of work to really understand that a different human side a different meaning of what I meant to be human I was I remember I had conversations with life and death because life and death the two-partue commanders you know we were getting asked questions we were getting the people that we're saying well should you guys been going on the day or should you guys been working with like we were getting all those questions and I had a legitimate sit down with both those guys and I was like listen we cannot be emotional about this we cannot respond it came after we went to a meeting where it was an officer detailer meeting and we were you know it's sort of plotting out what the what an officer career should look like blah and so he goes on to point it just like you all did with the attitude of like okay cool you know nothing's going on we're going to go to a place with a good gym will train some Iraqi soldiers and we will you know get big and then sure enough as fate would have it you guys roll in and pretty quickly after you guys roll in the I don't know if you know this side of the story but the conventional some of the conventional commanders that were there when task unit bruiser was there found out that some of the guys from task unit bruiser were back in country and put out a very specific request for forces that spelled out exactly who they wanted and that's that's why you guys ended up getting the call for supporting the efforts inside of solder city which was a freaking disaster at the time yeah what you described took me years to learn and it is probably one of the most important traits of being a leader is having one the emotional and social intelligence of knowing your audience knowing who you're talking to and being dynamic enough that you can switch and craft your language your body language your tone of voice everything you do to suit the person you're talking to you can the way I would talk to a puttune seals would be very different then the way I would talk to a 60 year old COPD patient and COPD is like a long disease from common in folks who smoke who is in the hospital for the end of the time who wants to quit smoking and is frustrated and needs some guidance that patient is a different population and being able to have the clarity and intelligence to know that and to switch your language appropriately is so important to yield results and that goes for everything I'm you just that's why blanket leadership tenants don't work guiding principles work but you need a format to your own style to achieve the results and I think a lot of it starts with awareness with mindfulness of your own emotions of the emotions the body language that others are telling you because it gives you hints as to what they're feeling and if you know what they're feeling you understand where they're coming from that perspective you can disarm people by finding common ground and achieving results because most of the time all people want good things they just disagree on how to achieve that and again I don't want to sound fatalistic about this because I didn't think about it in a way I didn't think about it like hey throw caution when this is going to happen anyways it wasn't like that at all it was like reality the reality was you know the reality was I'm talking to the brigade commander every day I'm talking to the Italian commanders every day I know what to go on out there in some cases I'm tracking it you know by the hour and so that in my gut was the hardest was the most was the hardest thing that I had to deal with was just man just being worried about you guys that was it it's not time wasted that's not I would still be very feel very privileged and it'd be a huge honor to support on going missions so to me I have I don't know when I'll be assigned and I don't care I will be happy with whatever I had the honor of doing and I will fulfill any role to the best my ability future is bright well listen Johnny we've actually been going out at for a little over four hours right now I know we went through your whole life which is not bad in four hours what I know people are going to want to contact you talk to you you know getting touch with you I know that you're on social media now big time unfortunately I say my words carefully and that's that meant so much to me so a lot of times I don't understand when a person who is in buddha and is not a performer and everyone else wants him to quit how they could like be there because I care so much about what my brothers think that if they didn't want me there I would never be there I would never want to slow anyone else down I don't know to answer your question you know there were certainly hard times I don't think there was ever a time where I wanted like I'm gonna quit but there was definitely times where I wanted the pain to stop and one particular time I remember it was you know that two hour nap you get in buds or in hell week and you said sustained presence on the moon sustained while getting to the moon by 2024 at this current time is not we are not planning on having sustained presence in 2024 by 2028 we are planning on having sustained presence on the moon so having the lunar outpost and learning what it's like to live called a planetary haka-cou-boon learning what it's like like having challenges and struggles because the space station is 250 miles away it's a four-hour trip if something bad happens on the space station it's reassuring knowing that there is a vehicle a Soyuz vehicle which is a Russian vehicle waiting there to take our crew members back to Earth if needed the moon is longer it's four-ish days to get back Mars that's even longer we're talking about months so it's prudent that we learn as much as we can but what it's like to live on a different planetary body like the moon before we try and get to Mars and that's what having sustained presence on the moon is all about the when when do you think you'll get assigned to a crew is it even noble so you know their critters are they have a difference between accidents and luck could you keep calling things accidents some of it sounds like it might be a little bit more luck some of it's luck that you made accidents I don't know I think I think what I'm trying to point out is that there wasn't a plan God not a plan at all I mean plan for me was just I like to told you all I wanted to be was a seal I had no idea no aspirations to be a physician to be an astronaut I just want one goal at a time that's really important to me even to this day that you have one singular goal because you should be all in and what you're doing you should be genuine in what you're doing not have some social climbing some some professional ladder that you're trying to meet these goals and be stepping stones and why I said accidents because I didn't want to be a corpsman in fact I wanted to be an intelligent specialist because the sounded cool or an operation I had no idea what an IS or an OS which is the rating for those to job didn't I just sounded cool so I've met a bit on the the the the Saturn or weaker side of the gray man but work up you you know as the as the guy that was running it the only people that kind of that showed up on my radar a lot where people that were having problems and you didn't show up on radar as having problems you were pretty much could do everything I mean what I appreciated about the teams was that it was a true meritocracy you got out of it what you put in and my original fears of being the menic of being boxed into just that responsibility because I wanted to do more I wanted to be the best asset I could be to my patreon to to my brothers and I quickly fell under the mentorship of many other people on the batoon Chris Cal was the primary sniper navigator point man and new guys kind of get matched up to a person he was the person I got matched up to because I would eventually be groomed to take on his responsibilities so early on I got tasked with being like the assistant lead now and point man and sniper which eventually got to take on these roles more a primary leader and workup and also on the point man so that meant that responsibility meant so much to me and I wanted to practice and train and wake up early and make sure just because I didn't want to mess it up not for myself but because I felt I owed and I did owe that responsibility of doing a good job to my patreon hey I got to admit this is like furl he's like if I like slacker whatever like I don't I can't like mentally allow myself to wear the shirt he's like I can't cuz it's like I'm betraying the shirt for sure same but but he said something along the lines of you know when we were saying well it'd be good to do this job or that job or whatever and the conversation was going and he said something along the lines of well not everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were because I think you know he was just trying to say be good for guys to be able to get another shit and he goes not everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were then and I get what he was saying but like I had to I had to you know just detach a little bit because let's face it so what did that duty you August 2 2006 hard to articulate in words what that day did I talked a little bit in the beginning of how my father has shaped my actions to become the seal well I'd say the events that unfolded on August 2 2006 and days afterwards where we lost much better warriors than I much braver and selfless that the hoses were much more formative in shaping what I do and will do for the rest of my life you know we lost the actions of that day we lost two really good man um I don't even know where to start you know one of my good friends one of our good friends Ryan Joe was hitting the face God I learned a lot that day I think we all I think we all did and a piece of us stayed there that day died with us you know Ryan was was hitting the face I'm glad we talked about everything that's in that book today so so much of this stuff is exactly what I talk about one of the things I talk about there in there is you know modulating you know how you have to modulate your leadership principles and how you know you can't use the same tool with one person the same way you use that same tool with a different person the same way you use it with someone else you have to understand who you're dealing with and figure out how much of that specific tool to apply if you can even use that tool because different people respond differently to different things absolutely you know what I wish I'm gonna admit I have not read any of your books but I've learned from watching you from watching lathe from watching other leaders you know Scott who is my next OSC and mentors along the road and making mistakes all these tried and true lessons I've been fortunate to make those mistakes and learn from them and I feel like I I've been fortunate to have a lot of teachers and mentors role models along the way throughout life the life is certainly one high school teachers you know medical school at NASA my current job and just trying to take a little bit of what they teach you those pearls and incorporate into your own style to what works for you and certainly with Chris I had a lot of those pearls that I learned to help me become a better operator and a better leader now as you're doing these missions and you know it was there there was a lot of a lot of violence happening a lot of violence happening our army and Marine Corps brothers were getting wounded almost wounded or killed almost on a daily basis the amount of enemy attacks was basically almost 24 hours a day there were enemy attacks happening inside the city there were massive IDs that were just sickening you know you could hear them you to hear them on base go off or for your out and town you could hear them go off I could go on of the people who have sacrificed and were much braver than I could ever be and that does a couple things to you it it humbles you for life I think if you remember that right knowing that no matter what you do in this lifetime it will never be enough and not that it's comparison but that pursuit is important but it made me want to fill in that void to make up for the good they would have done and that's how a lot of us honor our friends it's certainly how I honor my friends and for me that's being as impactful as possible to this world it doesn't matter what that is it could be in the form of serving as a team guy or serving as a physician or what my path is taking me to now as serving as a nationalat I wanted to be impactful and to me going to Harvard was giving me a better a bigger platform to be impactful it wasn't the name it wasn't the brand it wasn't the education you be fooling yourself to think that going to Harvard is going to make you a better doctor that's not true at all you would be just as good of a doctor anywhere you go to in this country but it was having a platform to be able to affect positive change that's why I wanted to go to an institution like John Hopkins or Harvard really and for me that transition the years of university San Diego and the early years of medical school or the hardest sometimes it's hard it's weird to say and I'm sure you've said on previous podcasts everyone has multiple jobs we overlap responsibilities and so many ways we have you know half of the guys might be breachers so anyone can put an example in a slap and explosive on the door and and use the right one the appropriate one to get through to gain access to a building you know have you know a quarter of the guys our snipers so we cross we were able to fill in each other's roles and early on I was the assistant point man and navigator and one one of the snipers and of course the medic and at the time it was Chris leading a lot of those so it's learning from him how to as an navigator you're responsible for coming up with a ideal but safe route to your destination and you don't realize it at the time because you know you're just e4 e5 at the time just going through you think it's normal and they just whisper like get up and hit the surf and like the nicest most compassionate voice and it disarms you right because it they have circumvented that fight or flight response right you don't have you you don't mount that defense you just immediately get woken up very nicely and get sent to the cold water and that was the closest where I was like I want this to stop I want this pain and suffering to stop but as far as like being like I want to quit or I'm going to quit that wasn't there for me but I said something along the lines of like hey I don't like hospitals I don't like doctors I don't like nurses I don't like any of that stuff I have no idea why you would ever want to do this I don't know why you want to go being a hospital all day but you got to give me at least one cool thing that they I want to know that they put you in like an escape room I want to know that you had to like they were they were had they were shouldn't paint ball at you while you were doing math problems come on give me something you know indulge my fantasy a little bit nothing like that the it was fun really really funny Lay for give lay feedback on these books is if they have a little bit of context man you look at them and you go every but every single person that reads one of these books because I wish I would add this book and you know what I respond with I wish I had it too I wish I'd have to learn these lessons the hard way but sometimes sometimes sometimes that's the way you're gonna learn them but sometimes I mean it's not like anything we've talked about today is super novel that people haven't heard you need there's a right time and a right place to hear the lesson and advice and sometimes I'm certain a lot of the lessons I follow and principal guiding principles I live by every day I'm serving with humility remembering the sacrifices of others respecting everyone not taking things for granted those were said to me as a kid I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to receive those lessons so I firmly believe that people need to be ready to be mentored and to be taught so I can go back to the teams and he's looking at me like I'm literally like I'm crazy and he says like whoa like don't you like going to school and when you rather just stay here next to two semesters and and you know just go to classes and run i mean i'm gonna say factually you do use that word like a thing it's actually two we act well nonetheless yes origin main dot com is where you can get your ghee for that's you jiu-jitsu you're gonna do no ghee there's rash cards on there as well for also for that's you jiu-jitsu also for that's you jiu-jitsu or other things you know also if you're not doing jiu-jitsu you're taking a break you know or you're doing some social distancing or something like this you know whatever the case may be no worries we got some other stuff on there to wear is what government wise garment wise yes body covering items sure but what I think is awesome and definitely get this from Mike and which is like you guys could have walked out of that walked off that operation you know completed that mission and gone into freaking hiding like just been like this is not going to work this is we're we're not ready for this all those things but I think it's a great example of okay stand down for 72 hours we got to do some rehearsals we got to do some drills we got to get our shit together and and that was came naturally to me the second part was scouting and scouting you also have to pass the you have to get a certain score on the rifle on the stocking the stocking and the rifle of course like you know 200 yard marine core test data penultin we would have to do which is a pretty hard test it's all iron sights and I never shot a gun I was gonna say that's why I was asking you this question because you know like I already said most people going to sniper school have at least one deployment if not two or three and you know you shoot thousands and thousands around every workup and deployment but he showed up to boot camp and didn't know how to do the sidestroke that's insane and he learned in the locker room before the PST and this guy is like one most squared away and prepared guys ever and to this day I gave him like I'm like how did you show up and not know how to do the sidestroke but just from sheer willpower he made it through and and like performed very what we were swim buddies dive buddies anymore so they quit like those two things hey running and swimming pretty much are sorry running pretty much like you're gonna get put on the grind there and you're gonna your your times are gonna drop and you're gonna be there's not to me people like it dropped for running it happens for sure it's not to me people like I drop for obstacle course water though that's that's the separator I I think you can learn a lot about someone I think you learn the most about someone you squeeze them right because in an eight to five office job you can put on a mask and be whoever you want to be for that period of time you can fool a lot of people but when people are squeezed when you strip away that comfort and they're tired and hungry and cold and suffering that armor just gets melted away and you start to see true core characteristics and that's why we do hell leak and buds right you want to strip away all that armor and see what is left of that person if that is someone you want by your side when you aren't your darkest days because you're getting you're in the heat of battle and you're getting fired upon you want that person that you know is not going to quit now I'm not saying the cheapest and easiest way to find candidates is through a rock on them and say margin this direction but you have a choice and the power to craft your own destiny your own path and for that reason I think it's a I think it is less important that I keep stuff like this close to my chest and then that's why I'm sharing it with you well that's that's one of the very reasons why this podcast even exists is for people to learn one of the people go through that they're not alone that things could be worse for them they could get better I mean that's so exactly what you said is the exact reason why sharing that story is is absolutely important because people can people can learn from it people can people can get over their own things that they're facing because they know that someone else did it don't if you don't step up no one's going to notice you if you don't start barking orders no one's going to listen to you and I have to tell people over and over again that's not true I mean how many times did you hear me yell at life or Seth or anyone in task in a bruiser and our emergency single time and that's not something I would you praise in public but criticize in public is is not I cannot think of a situation where that is a good idea to humiliate or be little a subordinate that is that is not in gender trust that is a very immature thing to do and that's what we talk about like letting your motion take control your ego take control of your actions you know it's not something I've ever seen and and people look at me and they judge a book by the cover and they think oh juggle man can you imagine you must just been crazy you know the first phase is like pay because like photographic image capture where you basically learn how to use a nestle lock camera to take facial recognition pictures basically for you know SR or special reconnaissance and that's all geek stuff like using computers setting up a network, sending you know sending pictures through radio waves I love that stuff it's good for your brain and your body how about that that's good that's simple and if you like beverages if you like to drink things you'll like these you know they they will taste they will satisfy your taste with a 100% accuracy and fulfillment you'll be stoked so it's not like you're going to joke this down so I was I through just rain and circumstances got in met a action a former astronaut named Scott parents and ski who was is also a physician and served with the shuttle during the shuttle era and had a lot of great missions and a huge impact and listened to him talk passionately about our space program that kind of gave me the idea and then just like in the teams I just researched what it meant to be what the requirements were and the realized I actually like my math degree was consistent with that getting a medical degree having the operational experience working in close teams making hard decisions with limited data under constrained times those were all consistent with the traits and experiences that NASA was looking for throw so through an accident or whatever you want to call it I was able to have this privilege and honor to serve our astronaut core what's that screening process how many interviews did you go through before they gave you the yet the up check so there are I can't go into great detail of of this just because of the sensitivity around application to actually right now coisently NASA is looking for the next class of astronauts I know I saw that on your Instagram till till the end of March which Johnny Kims out recruit in the for NASA
