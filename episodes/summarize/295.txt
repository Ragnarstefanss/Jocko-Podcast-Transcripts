They don't want to mean, uh, and so, but we would get into our spider holes and we would, you know, we would, you know, I mean, we would practice, um, uh, I remember given my baton commander briefing, you know, saying, hey, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna be in these holes, guys are gonna be in the holes for, uh, 72 hours, and then we're gonna, under the covered darkness rotate them out, get them back to the, um, to our, you know, mission support site, yet a debrief, and then we're gonna send them back to Phoenix to recover in a wholesale, right, clean all their kit, and we, we had this whole process, and we're gonna be, we, we made our spider holes and all our camouflage out of, uh, PVC pipes and all that stuff, right, and we break it all down, you putting your pack and then you'd set it all up and you dig your hole, and that's what you're gonna be in, right, and we, we even came up with, you know, different exercises and the spike, because it couldn't get out of spider holes, right, and so he goes, so what are you gonna do with the, uh, human waste? and I think that one of the biggest things that we saw in 2005 to 2007 was that this brought about I'm up approach has merit over a top down approach right although there are aspects of the top down approach that you still need to apply but really if you're talking about security and safeguarding population and making that area in area that the enemy can't operate in that's going to be the way that you need to go and from 2007 to five to seven we learned that but the other thing that we learned was during this time frame you know the US you know transitioned the mission to NATO and that's when it became a full fledged NATO operation and a very good friend of mine Dave Frazier who's written a book about Afghanistan at about his time they're during this time took over that's when they went from 06 as curdles and in some cases navy captains commanding the regional commands you know north southeast and west in Afghanistan to general officer level headquarters and Dave came in he was a Canadian special ops guy who I had had a relationship with really really good guy and when we got into Afghanistan he said hey I need to come over here I need to talk to you about you know what we're going to do and how we're going to do this because we got a problem and more than we came in here to do peacekeeping operations and although it's not popular thing to say my assessment is is that we're fighting an insurgency and a deadly one and he knew that that was our assessment as well our intel guys and everybody had the same assessment going in there from first to time third group and our group headquarters up north so anyways he called me in and we had it everyone's back the only person that didn't that got taken off was the sergeant major of our our uh sipping you know our direct action teams and that's because after we talked to him he took all 45 of his guys the next day over at launch tool ran him through the program and when he was getting his MRI to see if he had any traumatic rain injury they found a tumor about the size of an eraser on his brain he got met back to to Walter Reed they took the tumor off they said hey you know if this had gone another year you would have been figuring out an end of life plan and they replaced his left hip that he had been you know dealing with for years and he was a new man right and an advocate of this whole program and you know after he left the team he went off to our training and has been an advocate for this and you know promoting it ever since and this is what you get you get guys with a better understanding very bottom up but they got to have that top down cover President Trump I think had the right idea let's figure out how we can come out of afghanistan well nobody gave him a plan right when he asked for it two years into administration just didn't have plan to come out so you know hey the political situation you know overcomes everything right going into a presidential election year a big year for the congress you know and that starts driving decision making start driving decision making and really instead of the guys on the ground right exactly and so here we go and you know the president was response of the current president who's got to make a decision that's that's our tribe and there's several tribes there multiple tribes with they all agreed that that's what needed to happen so this idea of you know decentralized command but also this idea of hey the people that are on the ground that are from there they know who's good and who's bad and the local populist is going to support the neighborhood kids that are now neighborhood police and that's just it's it we were lucky enough to kind of watch that unfold I was lucky enough to watch that unfold and and see those the what they called the Suns of Iraq and it was interesting too because in Iraq there had been there had been out in al-Kaim the Marine Corps had pushed through al-Kaim and when they did it there was a bunch of locals going hey there's bad guys in that building over there there's bad and so the Marines said hey you know what let's organize these guys and they made this this thing called desert protector which was hey if you're a local and you want to help us out cool you can join this program called desert protector and they started to send it was working pretty well well when Maliki got elected all of a sudden he looks out an al-ambar province and they got all these desert protectors out there and he goes way to second now I got a bunch of random rogue security forces running around I can't have that I can't I can't have that and I said hey listen mistakes happen these things happen please you need you need to focus on keeping yourself I mean he was seriously and you need to focus on keeping self alive so you can get home to your family these things happen don't blame yourself now I know to this day because I've spoken to him quite a bit you know the burden that he carries but at the end of the day fog of war mistakes happen so leadership responsibility but it wasn't until then that I realized oh crap we got a we got a friendly fire incident here and so when the investigation team came down to investigate we were already in candle hall and we were already set up but we had already written our statements and you know I had a pretty good packet form knowing you know anticipating what was going on and I think you talked about that in your book as well you know and so I'm out now campaigning we're raising money we're getting our message out there it's being very well received in the last poll you know four months ago when they did a poll I was at 30 percent I'm now up at 45 percent right so moving in the right direction so if people want to help out where do they where do they find you where do they go to help you out so my website is www.donball dick.com and you know you can go there and you can either you know if you want to help the campaign out if you're in New Hampshire that's easy to do you just sign up you know everything is right there on the website my positions are there on the website so if you're interested in how I feel in the second amendment or whatever it's there and if you want to donate it's there you know I start pretty low and so I was right in the middle of that process because we were right in the middle of of doing all of that for the next five years and I got put in charge of the movement of seventh group from Fort Bragg to Destin Florida for their new headquarters and setting that up and what that would look like and although not perfect we really really did create an optimal special forces group headquarters with all the Rangers and all the things associated with so they could do all the levels of training right there and what you learn about working with communities and briefing communities because there's noise things and noise studies and this that you know housing issues and you know is there going to be enough housing you know houses all going I'm you just unbelievable and so I mean that's that's kind of difference between the Taliban and LK at the time they're on the ground and how they were just you know dealt with differently and we didn't really worry about the Afghans because they always switch sides but it was the it was the LK because they were from Oman they were from Saudi Arabia they were from Pakistan they were from some other place right and not well but no they were not welcome and you know one of the worst places to go when we first got there was the soccer field because that's where all the hangings the headings and the stoning of women took place I mean stoning women and and the killing of children for flying a kite we handed out thousands of kites when we got down there because they're huge kite flying folks they have competitions you know where they tack each other with the kites you know it's just like this huge thing anyways they loved it You know, okay, this guy, prior and listed Ranger School graduate, you know, Airborne School, you know, the whole nine yard, and so it just gave you more credibility, and as an enlisted guy served in the fourth ID in the second Airborne, so I had that in my background, and so it was all good, but, but, you know, yeah, chemical corps, you get put on the battalion staff, and you have to do the, you know, you get, you get all the, you know, nobody's really interested in doing nuclear biological and chemical. so I mean, God just kept opening up these little doors for me to like, you know, scoot through, and before I knew it, it was, you know, I was major on my way to command a general staff college, and halfway to retirement, you know, 20 years, and I had a few extra years because I've been with you the time, so I was like, you know, hey, if I make it to Lieutenant Colonel, I'm going to be doing pretty damn good, so I was pretty happy about that. and but I learned one thing at the work college it's not necessarily the war college and what you learn there it's winning the gym thorp sports event where all the war colleges come to the army war college and you compete right in a variety of different sporting events and the army is only lost at twice who do they lose in their history of they usually you lose it to the navy war college for the what are the events the national war college their teams are so small right because the school is so small they get their butts kicked all the time but the army war college and you know you got the army the air force the navy the coastguard academy you know you got all those guys that come down and it's a it's three days of feats of strength but I was very lucky that I was able to do that job because I got to see a lot and got to understand what was happening and understand how these high level decisions were made and see a little bit into the future what was it from from your experience what did you see that what did you learn that was important well all of what you just learned but more importantly I learned how all the you know how these decisions have made inside the the political level right from the top and all these things that are done so when I got back to the tactical level I could explain to the guys what's going on at the strategic level and although although they may not like it at least I had a familiarity and an understanding and be able to explain what's going on in the whole process and why we're sitting here you know waiting to be ordered to go do something or what would have you I I went to French five times right to talk to the highest levels of their government about you know what was going on there and you know so what was going on in Africa is is something that America's taking its eye off of and 1.4 billion people by 2050 it will be 2.4 billion people and incredible it's in resources there incredible amount of resources huge and what goes through South America into the United States you know South America is not very far from the African West coast and you got all those traditional lines of illicit trafficking that go through Europe the Iranians have multiple have been able to establish multiple places where they have infiltrated Africa all over Africa to move men weapons and resources at a drop of the hat if they need to would it would kick off like like a ditch of like napal fire would come up also like violent booby traps bombs the old ones with like you like the you know you know Vietnam era stuff where like you stick to sticks and they would they were spring loaded kind of things and they would come and they would just hit you in the thigh or the leg or what have you upper body those kind of things and I'll you know do whatever you need me to do I'll work on a staff I'll do whatever you know pick staples out of the rugs I don't care just you know just get in there early and get myself you know ready for you know the command but they'd have booby traps but they wouldn't be violent booby traps they just be like alarm tightly you know like I heard one where they had just like cases and cases of mouse traps so like if you step on any you nudged it it would have a like you know like a bunch of birds taking off whatever but louder it'd be something like that like that kind of stuff they had so that was another part you know like I told you before with the secretary of the army and then working at ASD and then the joint staff and all that all coming together really gave me tremendous insight on on how use of sock you know United States Army special operations command works and again a lot of guys that make very senior ranks don't have any idea how that works because they don't get the opportunity to go there and that was because I come out of the time command I get selected for the work college and it's like oh now what the hell we're going to do right and and we although I am an advocate of you know figuring out how to come out of there I'm more of an advocate of coming out of there the right way and there's a lot to lose there particularly I mean I'm signing a lot of letters today from 20 years of working with people there in Afghanistan and interpreters and workers barbers you know guys you know gardeners guys that really put their life on the line to support us and to help us them and their families and now they're left there and and so a special forces ODA which I was getting my point is we didn't always have the flexibility of replacing marines with marines and so on and so forth but SF ODA gets out there and that next Sunday I got a story board and they're eating the two turkeys they didn't have the same connection with those turkeys and the afghans the cooks they're all smiling you know they got there you know they're all happy but anyways then sir you were in that tour for 22 months you're over there in afghanistan and then what what what happens when you get no without so I get done with that and they say hey you're gonna go to the joint staff and you're gonna be the deputy deputy special operations guy in the joint staff and I'll be working for General Magata now the the the the VSO idea seemed to have faded and and lost some of its steam not so much from what was happening in the field but it seemed like we went in a different direction mm- I don't doubt it it's a good title that's Dakota one of my heroes and if you want to get some stuff to hang on your wall flipsidecampus.com got a bunch of books I've written a bunch of books but the one that's coming out next is called final spin we don't know if it's a novel we don't know if it's a poem we don't know if it's a manuscript we don't know what it is and they won't go sell because they want their kids to be able to draw they want their kids to be able to get right they want them to be able to you know so stop giving them converses sneakers you know it's they're not going to you know they're not going to wear and so we went back we did some planning we came back and briefed him and so what Charlie company first battalion got the mission and it was a instead of coming at them from you know uh can to heart province you know directly or helmet province where they expected it to come we went all the way down south into the red desert which is the red desert now when you fly in southern afghanistan and you're flying you know east of west or west to east there's the red desert that heads all the way down into Pakistan and it's nothing but desert and then there's a distinct line that goes into the built up areas in the green areas and so on and so forth and it's just so blat nobody goes down there only better ones go down there and so we tried to influence that the best we could with you know Rand studies and showing them that hey if we just keep this for a couple more years you know it's gonna be solid and the chance for resurgence will be way low and I mean look what we've done in terms of the dropping casualties you know lowering a casualties a record lows record highs and security the Taliban are pretty much slapping the table on defeat alkate is like hey we can't operate here anymore and that had a lot of due at the top down stuff going on too because you needed that I do I go back for Afghanistan again what proved to be 22 months and this is what 2010 2010 and I go back to Afghanistan as an advisor to the RC South Commander and at the time it was a Dutch commander by the name of major general de Croife and it was a Dutch guy and we were having some general McCristal was concerned about the problems with soft coordination so he said hey you're going to take command of siege sotofe so the siege sotofe that's the that's a combined joint special operations task force afghanistan this is the first thing that's going to be in charge of all special operations in Afghanistan that's correct and you get you get tasked with that outside of the tier one guys yeah tier one guys not included so anyways we uh I'm going to take command of that that's going to be my brigade level command opportunity and I couldn't have been more excited I have Admiral Olson and general kerni to thank for that they're the ones that pick me so I was had a great relationship with Admiral Olson and general kerni general kerni was then the deputy the deputy of socom but before that and during my time as a retired commander he was the sock special operations command central commander is a two star so that's how I built that relationship with him and general Olson or excuse me Admiral Olson develop a good relationship with him but when you start getting involved in a country's institutions and you start getting involved in their culture and their society and your outsider it's never going to be received well and you're probably going to you know trample of or something that you should just you know just stay away from but the good things will happen as they you know continue to move forward and another thing that a lot of people in the villages they didn't want to go from the seventh century to the 21st century I mean it you know it kind of is it's kind of is what it is and and our guys would see it because our guys would stay there and you know all the boots and the shoes and the jackets and you know they don't wear hooded sweatshirts you know give them blankets you know when when you talked earlier you mentioned that you know we were helping them we were right in the constitution we were setting up the government and there's a you know when I talk about leadership a lot which I do I talk about what happens when you try and impose your plan onto your subordinates onto your team you impose your plan onto them look you can kind of get away with it sometimes depending on the authority that you have depending on the amount of leadership capital that you have depending on how much oversight you're allowed to kind of sit there and if you're going to impose their plan the plan on them yeah we we just you know came together and did it and every single whether it was Marsauk whether it was you know their teams or the Navy seal teams or the special forces teams these platforms did really really well and just give us a quick brief on the idea of of the VSO of the of the village stability operations what was so if if I was an ODA team leader I was a seal platoon leader what was what was my mission what was it gonna look like so your mission is to go is to go into say it's you know can't do hard province and you do the physical fitness test and you do the the psychological test and it was like going through special ops again you know all those things that lead up to you get in you got a qualify physically mentally you know you got to pass the the full physical test and I have two prosthetic hips and three prosthetic discs because of combat injuries and that was the thing that we're worried about the most right but it's much better from a leadership perspective to say hey Don you know here's this mission how do you want to do it and kind of let you come up with the plan it seems like America has a tendency to want to impose you know our way onto countries whether it's Vietnam or there's the Vietnam thing the way that unfolded and the way we tried to sort of impose what we wanted it to look like and the Vietnamese don't like that and and you know I wasn't a screamer at home I would just not involve myself anything right just come home and mind my own damn business not getting involved and that was that and you know if something came up I would exit stage right and avoid dealing with you know and then he told Karzai I'm on my way to Orr's gun province when I get the Tarenk out of Lichko, Lichino and we'll start clearing that place out and you know Karzai put governors in Orr's gun province is a bull province for our province, Nimru's province, Helman province, Helman was the one that we got the largest number of Taliban al-Qaeda and operational Russian equipment out of and we had to negotiate that right we had to negotiate that with the Taliban leader there that you know he would you know he'd be free to go off and do whatever you wanted to do and that's that's that's almost a continuity when you do nine months there six months home and then nine months back there you start to get some real continuity what what did you see in that deployment or those two deployments you get to see like a bigger arc of the story yes with with a better thread through it so we really saw the the reemergence and the resurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in 2005 when we got there may have 2005 is when we got there now now obviously 2003 I think I might have cut you off when you were about to say this before but 2003 things are looking about as good as we could hope in Afghanistan the war kicks off in Iraq that means people are you know American soldiers resources are now pouring into Iraq that sort of becomes the focus and and that allows over in Afghanistan where we had had a big presence now something that's drawn down now the sudden the you know al-Qaeda and the Taliban start to see opportunities Even when I, even, you know, even when I wasn't a very good version of myself because of post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury and, you know, pain management issues and, you know, I mean, that negatively affected my personal professional life too, you know. so yes this one goes for you to make sure it's hats some uh rash cards on there uh hoodies on there shorts on there you want to shoot that's as good with or without jocco's face you got the option though you know some good stuff on there check that if you look at that stuff you like something get something we do have a subscription situation on there as well cut the shirt locker cool designs depending on your opinion to be sure but we think they're cool general consensus they're cool designs are fun you know a little bit different so at that point there's a pretty good it looks it's looking pretty good at this point it looks real good it looks real good they're doing at the Afghan way and and the airfield in Kandahar was something that we wanted to secure so that we could you know use it to bring in and bring out you know supplies and stuff like that so general Madness one star general at the time the Marines got that mission and so their operational area was was really confined to Kandahar airfield right they didn't want to they were very happy being in the seventh century you know one of the things that I would always tell folks that would would come to you know to do humanitarian work in Afghanistan I say don't give them coats don't give them shoes they don't want that all they're going to do they're going to smile at you they're going to say thank you so much they'll even have kids running around with this stuff on I called it, I called it building Barney Rubble Machines, right, because it was like, oh, here's a trailer with only one tire, and here's some straps, and here's some poles, and you know, you got to move it 10 kilometers, and you know, they would set up these tabs, and you had to build like, so it was like on the farm. so I ended up you know I got a business degree because I thought that that's what officers do right and so learning how to run a business I said you know that's going to help me out and it did right so I started talking to my interpreters and I go hey what's going on can you help us you know if I want to understand what's happening he's like of course they are he's that the soldiers know that that's that's that's that's their boss and he's going to take a little piece that's the way it works that's that's that's fine so us going in and trying to impose what we have this ideal of the way things should be doesn't always match up culturally in the turns into a problem and you know we just we're you know we're at a point in time now where you know strategy and policy and security inside our country and outside our country is is you know and so you know I did not want to leave the group S3 job at all I just you know I didn't want to and when I got asked the question by secretary white you know do you want to be they you want this job and my answer was sir I was like, wow, the good Lord was smiling on me, because, you know, and I went to Ranger School, and I did all those things that you're supposed to do, so when I showed up at the combat arms units, right, and I had that, you know, I wasn't just a support guy, right? and so you know by by the middle of by the middle of 2013 and everything was you know falling into place to where the afghans and none of the things that they said you know it wasn't a perfect perfect program but what program is perfect it was good enough right right so we went in and we mocked all that up right because we would just start familiar with the tribes and it's a lot of try to idealistic about the way we think things are going to be I remember a very similar example we had these young Iraqi soldiers and the officers were skimming their paychecks and you know my guys coming to me there they're you got their skimming the paychecks of these young and listed guys and if they didn't switch sides well you know the you know Afghans you know would would deal them through Afghan wall right and custom whatever LK to different story they were Arabs and oh we had to be very very careful because there was only one fake for them if they gotten the hands of the Afghans who had been family said been killed and tortured so on so forth You know, come on, cut that stride in half, you know, but, you know, they, they move at their pace, and they can't, they can't be slackened, because, you know, then the instructor sees their slackened. and I worked with him to ensure that he could he understood and could implement this mission everything from you know making sure they got the training make sure they got the weapons make sure they got the oversight make sure they got you know they're doing everything they possibly can and it was integrated into the afghan government fully and 100% First Battalion third group my guys got awarded for the first time the equivalent of the Canadian presidential unit citation the only foreign military in the history of the Canadian military to get that award and they got that award and it sits in the battalion headquarters at Fort Bragg proudly and you know they sent down their equivalent to their chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to Fort Bragg and all the guys got it penned on him it took him four years to get it approved but he didn't quit and he finally got it approved and I was I was just getting out of the work college at that time was 2009 and you know organized things and slow but surely you know I started seeing security and Southern Afghanistan just you know shape up and then and how long did you stay in Afghanistan for for that first rotation from November to March and then the so you left in March of 2002 right had the governor's been put in position and you know I mean I spent four years in in US Africa and two years 26 months and that was commanding special operations command in Africa and we had 28 countries over 2000 special ops troops on the ground advising assisting training and conducting operations through with and by our partners to get after al Shibab right some of ISIS Somalia right out in the East there Central Africa the Lord's Resistance Army and now ISIS is there and Nigeria would bokeh her arm in ISIS West Africa and and and Chad and Cameroon and Pekingafaso and Mauritania and Senegal and and all of the affiliates of al-Qaeda that are out there reap and havoc right the French have over 4,000 troops on the ground so when you say go to what do you mean go to like they thought they thought it was places that had intel or had bad guys in it and all under 180 of them were dry old like towns villages are like actual target packages targets without the target packages it was just a little station and we think there's something there but the places that all 180 of more dry holes but the places that we got all the computers and all the stuff that that some of them loud was working on and we'll all my was working on we're given to us by the Afghans that were on the ground hey they worked out of that one they worked out of that they worked out of this and and we would get a calls and hey we got LK to there see that's where it became tricky because Taliban were Afghans so you get them and they either switch sides or they didn't switch sides right I'm going to listen to us there's still going to skim it there's still going to do the thing they'll just figure out a different way to do it and although we see that that is bad I'm not saying it's good I'm saying it's just the way it is right and over time these things will change like we saw in Afghanistan right now the ambassador to the United States and Afghanistan is a woman never would have been that way in 2001 or five or ten but in 20 it's a woman that's great that's progress they'll figure it out and then they're gonna create all kinds of humanitarian violations are gonna kill people you know Karzai was worried that they would get too strong and take over the government you know when you go down there at that level they didn't have those they didn't have those aspirations they wanted to control their village they just wanted to live control their village have their family get their family educated bringing their crops to market and let them right and not have anybody bothered or they they had they had known this is how I need to take over Afghanistan because they saw a couple is as big a problem as anything else And so, you know, coming up with a fix for the tractor, for the hay bailer, when it went down, or something like that, was, you know, it was always right there, right? you know legal limit of driving under the influence so for I don't know 25 years or so I was shit faced at work without taking a drop of alcohol you know and and think about your decision making and stuff like that so you know they like cooking equipment you give them cooking equipment they make a great stew you know you might pay for it for a few days if if you eat it on our stomach right and the other thing that we were doing was we were introducing medical supplies that were causing more harm than good because we needed the medical supplies because the way we grow up and live in America our immune system is much different than what they look and it was affecting my relationships with you know my family it was affecting relationships in the military I was always you know wired for sound go high and right really quick and who's my temper and not want to listen to people and it just negatively affected everything right
