00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.74
This is Jocco podcast number 169.

2
00:00:02.74 --> 00:00:05.64
But echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:06.94
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:06.94 --> 00:00:07.94
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.94 --> 00:00:13.64
And tonight we have a return guest by the name of Jocco.

6
00:00:13.64 --> 00:00:21.48
So before listening to this podcast, if you have not listened to podcast 24, 25, and

7
00:00:21.48 --> 00:00:29.44
one 11, then go back and listen to those podcasts first so that you can hear about Jocco's

8
00:00:29.44 --> 00:00:36.80
life growing up, joining the Canadian Army, his trials and tribulations in the Canadian Army,

9
00:00:36.80 --> 00:00:39.40
his successes and his failures.

10
00:00:39.40 --> 00:00:46.84
How he eventually became a sniper, served overseas, eventually an Afghanistan where he

11
00:00:46.84 --> 00:00:51.76
was wounded, badly lost both of his legs.

12
00:00:51.76 --> 00:01:01.72
But drove on became a successful politician in the city of Ottawa and was carrying on with

13
00:01:01.72 --> 00:01:03.84
his life.

14
00:01:03.84 --> 00:01:09.80
But things were not as pretty on the inside as they might have appeared on the outside.

15
00:01:09.80 --> 00:01:18.40
When Jocco came back on for podcast, 11, 11, I had a suspicion that things might not

16
00:01:18.40 --> 00:01:25.40
being going that great, there seemed to be something lurking just beneath the surface.

17
00:01:25.40 --> 00:01:33.92
And for whatever reason, and there is no good reason that I can give, I didn't say anything.

18
00:01:33.92 --> 00:01:39.36
And I actually talked to a couple of my buddies who fought the same thing, who said, man,

19
00:01:39.36 --> 00:01:42.64
Jodi didn't quite sound right on that.

20
00:01:42.64 --> 00:01:47.80
And it was the same thing that I thought, it was the same thing that I could sense in my

21
00:01:47.80 --> 00:01:52.76
gut and my gut was right.

22
00:01:52.76 --> 00:01:56.92
There was more going on behind the scenes.

23
00:01:56.92 --> 00:02:02.48
And Jodi is back today to explain where he's been.

24
00:02:02.48 --> 00:02:03.24
What happened?

25
00:02:03.24 --> 00:02:11.32
How he slipped off of the path and how he has gotten back on it.

26
00:02:11.32 --> 00:02:12.32
So Jodi.

27
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:13.32
Jago.

28
00:02:13.32 --> 00:02:14.32
Welcome back.

29
00:02:14.32 --> 00:02:15.32
Thank you, brother.

30
00:02:15.32 --> 00:02:16.32
And I guess I mean that more ways than one.

31
00:02:16.32 --> 00:02:17.84
Yeah.

32
00:02:17.84 --> 00:02:22.56
So talk to me, bro.

33
00:02:22.56 --> 00:02:26.000
Getting wounded sucked.

34
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And you know, when was I here last?

35
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.36
January 2018, I think Kelly and I rolled through Kelly.

36
00:02:35.36 --> 00:02:38.48
I wasn't there, but I don't know if anybody can see her here.

37
00:02:38.48 --> 00:02:41.68
But Kelly is my fiance and my best friend.

38
00:02:41.68 --> 00:02:42.68
She's present.

39
00:02:42.68 --> 00:02:43.68
She's present.

40
00:02:43.68 --> 00:02:45.68
She's not watching on YouTube.

41
00:02:45.68 --> 00:02:48.32
She was our dog Athena.

42
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:50.56
But anyway, yeah, man.

43
00:02:50.56 --> 00:02:59.52
I spent 2007 to 2017 pretending I had prosthetic feet that didn't matter.

44
00:02:59.52 --> 00:03:02.40
I guess I had my feet blown off.

45
00:03:02.40 --> 00:03:08.92
And Kelly saw what had like at some point after I was elected.

46
00:03:08.92 --> 00:03:11.56
Because what was the position you're elected to city councilor?

47
00:03:11.56 --> 00:03:13.56
I think I don't know.

48
00:03:13.56 --> 00:03:15.28
You call them all their men down here, maybe?

49
00:03:15.28 --> 00:03:17.000
Yeah.

50
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.40
And because I just come off the amazing race Canada.

51
00:03:20.40 --> 00:03:21.76
And I was second place on that.

52
00:03:21.76 --> 00:03:24.44
So I was popular in Canada.

53
00:03:24.44 --> 00:03:25.84
So that helped me with the election.

54
00:03:25.84 --> 00:03:28.76
But also raised my profile in Canada.

55
00:03:28.76 --> 00:03:31.68
And so they made me the sports commissioner for the city.

56
00:03:31.68 --> 00:03:34.52
And I was the veterans liaison.

57
00:03:34.52 --> 00:03:36.48
And things like that.

58
00:03:36.48 --> 00:03:40.76
And my personal relationship wasn't going that well.

59
00:03:40.76 --> 00:03:41.88
And you know, things like that.

60
00:03:41.88 --> 00:03:44.96
So things in the background, like you said, of life.

61
00:03:44.96 --> 00:03:46.84
Everyone says, oh, you look like the perfect family.

62
00:03:46.84 --> 00:03:49.72
But you know, like it's what else are you going to put on Facebook?

63
00:03:49.72 --> 00:03:50.72
Right?

64
00:03:50.72 --> 00:03:51.84
I mean, that's what it's for.

65
00:03:51.84 --> 00:03:55.20
And we were just going in different directions.

66
00:03:55.20 --> 00:03:55.96
And that's fine.

67
00:03:55.96 --> 00:04:02.56
So I actually split up and moved out in fall of 16.

68
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:09.12
And I found that politics job, frankly, as eager and as I was

69
00:04:09.12 --> 00:04:12.64
to serve, because politics despite what most people think

70
00:04:12.64 --> 00:04:14.52
is service to your country.

71
00:04:14.52 --> 00:04:17.12
Most politicians could probably make

72
00:04:17.12 --> 00:04:19.48
twice as much money doing other things.

73
00:04:19.48 --> 00:04:23.48
And just like when my book came out and flinching,

74
00:04:23.48 --> 00:04:27.36
I had that deal in place before I started campaigning.

75
00:04:27.36 --> 00:04:31.96
And I was like, well, well, and also with the amazing race.

76
00:04:31.96 --> 00:04:34.64
So I was like, one of these things will work out.

77
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:37.84
Turned out, I got, I got, I got, you know,

78
00:04:37.84 --> 00:04:38.68
what do you call it?

79
00:04:38.68 --> 00:04:41.68
And crabs where you throw and you get the dice are good.

80
00:04:41.68 --> 00:04:42.52
Seven.

81
00:04:42.52 --> 00:04:44.16
I got seven with every rule.

82
00:04:44.16 --> 00:04:48.48
So the show worked and then the book worked and then the election,

83
00:04:48.48 --> 00:04:49.32
I won it.

84
00:04:49.32 --> 00:04:51.68
So I had all these things to juggle, you know?

85
00:04:51.68 --> 00:04:55.40
And when I got elected and I was like happy about it,

86
00:04:55.40 --> 00:04:58.44
because I was like medically retiring that in 2014.

87
00:04:58.44 --> 00:04:59.96
I medically retired.

88
00:04:59.96 --> 00:05:03.28
And I didn't want to, of course, like all soldiers, right?

89
00:05:03.28 --> 00:05:04.28
We want to carry on.

90
00:05:04.28 --> 00:05:07.28
I wanted to train more snipers and more troops.

91
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:09.84
But anyway, I'm in service to my country.

92
00:05:09.84 --> 00:05:11.04
Awesome.

93
00:05:11.04 --> 00:05:15.72
And you know, people tell you something like,

94
00:05:15.72 --> 00:05:17.52
you know, going out for the seals.

95
00:05:17.52 --> 00:05:19.80
It's not what you see on TV and it's this and that.

96
00:05:19.80 --> 00:05:21.12
And you go, yeah, okay.

97
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:22.80
And of course, you know that.

98
00:05:22.80 --> 00:05:24.80
But until you're there, there's really no way.

99
00:05:24.80 --> 00:05:27.000
No one can prepare you for it, right?

100
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.84
You have to experience it.

101
00:05:27.84 --> 00:05:28.60
You actually live it.

102
00:05:28.60 --> 00:05:31.000
Yeah, like sniper school, you have to go next.

103
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.68
There's no way to prepare unless you do it.

104
00:05:33.68 --> 00:05:35.84
So politics is the same.

105
00:05:35.84 --> 00:05:37.20
And I'm a straight guy.

106
00:05:37.20 --> 00:05:40.56
And you know, we are honorable men for the most part.

107
00:05:40.56 --> 00:05:44.24
And we do our best to stick to our word and politics.

108
00:05:44.24 --> 00:05:49.12
I'm not saying that it's not that, but there's a whole lot of pretending.

109
00:05:49.12 --> 00:05:53.68
And by pretending, I mean, you have to say one thing and mean another.

110
00:05:53.68 --> 00:05:56.76
And you know, it's not necessarily lying, but it's not necessarily the truth.

111
00:05:56.76 --> 00:06:03.44
And the political brinkmanship that is with that job means always holding your cards very

112
00:06:03.44 --> 00:06:04.92
tight.

113
00:06:04.92 --> 00:06:08.48
And you know, and I know, I'm a combat guy.

114
00:06:08.48 --> 00:06:09.48
You know, I'm I'm action.

115
00:06:09.48 --> 00:06:10.88
And I'm about getting things done.

116
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:16.12
And although that worked in a lot of ways for politics and in a lot of other ways, it wasn't

117
00:06:16.12 --> 00:06:17.12
messing.

118
00:06:17.12 --> 00:06:21.56
So I had no, I had a couple colleagues on council that I liked and I hung out with.

119
00:06:21.56 --> 00:06:23.72
But for the most part, I didn't have any friends.

120
00:06:23.72 --> 00:06:24.72
Does that make sense?

121
00:06:24.72 --> 00:06:25.72
Yeah, definitely.

122
00:06:25.72 --> 00:06:26.72
Yeah.

123
00:06:26.72 --> 00:06:29.76
And my soldier brothers and sisters, they were around.

124
00:06:29.76 --> 00:06:33.96
But now I am this guy who is a politician and a best-selling author.

125
00:06:33.96 --> 00:06:35.12
And I was on an amazing race.

126
00:06:35.12 --> 00:06:39.44
So whenever I hung out, it was like, hey, let's talk about what you're doing.

127
00:06:39.44 --> 00:06:40.44
Me.

128
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:45.28
And I'm like, can we just talk about the last UFC or hey, what's going on at the unit?

129
00:06:45.28 --> 00:06:50.48
Or what's the latest equipment, a choir that's cool?

130
00:06:50.48 --> 00:06:52.68
People are inviting me places on the guest of honor here.

131
00:06:52.68 --> 00:06:57.76
And this and I'm like, I'm missing just being Jody.

132
00:06:57.76 --> 00:07:06.44
You know, and it got to a point where I was and then on top of it, my legs were not cooperating.

133
00:07:06.44 --> 00:07:12.32
They just didn't want to take the beating of everyday life anymore.

134
00:07:12.32 --> 00:07:14.72
And so I started drinking again.

135
00:07:14.72 --> 00:07:18.44
And it was drinking to mask the pain mostly, but also...

136
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:23.72
So what does that look like when you first of all, how long had you stopped drinking for?

137
00:07:23.72 --> 00:07:24.72
Or did you completely stop drinking?

138
00:07:24.72 --> 00:07:26.20
I never stopped drinking.

139
00:07:26.20 --> 00:07:30.56
But I was because I got addicted to the opioids, pardon me.

140
00:07:30.56 --> 00:07:34.76
Because I got addicted to my oxy-coat and I didn't want to take pain meds.

141
00:07:34.76 --> 00:07:39.36
So at the end of a day, long day, so I'd show up at the office usually between six

142
00:07:39.36 --> 00:07:44.24
and eight, you know, depending on what was going on and of what committees I was sitting

143
00:07:44.24 --> 00:07:47.000
on or of counsel, what meetings.

144
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.40
And then politics is all about being places to shake hands as well.

145
00:07:50.40 --> 00:07:51.72
And that's I love that part.

146
00:07:51.72 --> 00:07:53.36
Meeting people, talking to people, it's awesome.

147
00:07:53.36 --> 00:07:59.08
I have no, you know, me and the mayor go along and I, you know, I get along with the other

148
00:07:59.08 --> 00:08:01.52
two levels of government and it was fun.

149
00:08:01.52 --> 00:08:05.64
And you go places and you represent veterans and that's the important thing for me.

150
00:08:05.64 --> 00:08:08.76
And, you know, the whole point to get into politics is to be a better representative for

151
00:08:08.76 --> 00:08:11.68
my brothers and sisters that are now veterans.

152
00:08:11.68 --> 00:08:16.64
Yeah, because I got to throw this out there where you talked about how when you're a politician,

153
00:08:16.64 --> 00:08:18.64
you're serving your country.

154
00:08:18.64 --> 00:08:23.04
And unfortunately, there's a lot of politicians that when they're politicians, they're serving

155
00:08:23.04 --> 00:08:24.04
themselves.

156
00:08:24.04 --> 00:08:26.56
And I'm sure you must have seen that.

157
00:08:26.56 --> 00:08:31.40
And I know that's what makes people get that stereotypical negative attitude towards

158
00:08:31.40 --> 00:08:38.000
politicians because oftentimes politicians are just looking out for their best interests.

159
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.12
And whether that means they're doing things inside their district because they just want

160
00:08:43.12 --> 00:08:46.64
to get something for themselves like more money.

161
00:08:46.64 --> 00:08:49.52
But oftentimes, they're just doing what they need to do to get reelected.

162
00:08:49.52 --> 00:08:51.16
I just still self-servant.

163
00:08:51.16 --> 00:08:57.68
Well, that's the funny thing with politics is if you're self-serving, it's a catch

164
00:08:57.68 --> 00:08:58.68
22.

165
00:08:58.68 --> 00:08:59.68
Right?

166
00:08:59.68 --> 00:09:00.68
And you just pointed it out.

167
00:09:00.68 --> 00:09:05.36
Like, if I get reelected, I can still continue to do this for my community.

168
00:09:05.36 --> 00:09:06.80
But I have to get reelected.

169
00:09:06.80 --> 00:09:09.60
So I do this to get reelected and then I can do this for my community.

170
00:09:09.60 --> 00:09:10.60
Yeah.

171
00:09:10.60 --> 00:09:11.60
It's kind of like that.

172
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:12.60
You play the game.

173
00:09:12.60 --> 00:09:15.56
Yeah, it's that your favorite word, the dichotomy of politics.

174
00:09:15.56 --> 00:09:23.16
So, quite often though, I found myself like there is one thing where my staff and

175
00:09:23.16 --> 00:09:27.32
it was, and it's, you know, the stupidest things that I can get you, especially at city

176
00:09:27.32 --> 00:09:28.32
level.

177
00:09:28.32 --> 00:09:33.20
Well, level of politics and I can't at anyway, I don't know about here, but is the city

178
00:09:33.20 --> 00:09:34.76
level, the municipal level.

179
00:09:34.76 --> 00:09:40.56
Because you are plugged into 90% of most people's daily life's flesh and water.

180
00:09:40.56 --> 00:09:46.20
Our toilets, flesh and water running, 911 working, the dog park, you know, being cleaned

181
00:09:46.20 --> 00:09:49.64
up, the grass, you know, snow plowed, if you're in Canada.

182
00:09:49.64 --> 00:09:52.24
Here, I guess, I don't know, what do you guys have?

183
00:09:52.24 --> 00:09:54.76
Stormdrains that maybe get plugged in in the bottles.

184
00:09:54.76 --> 00:09:55.76
Potels?

185
00:09:55.76 --> 00:09:56.76
Potels?

186
00:09:56.76 --> 00:09:59.60
Yeah, I'm just an auto actually.

187
00:09:59.60 --> 00:10:01.24
So, you know, it's your always on.

188
00:10:01.24 --> 00:10:06.28
So, you go around, you meet people and so, you know, I love that part, but my legs started

189
00:10:06.28 --> 00:10:07.92
to just go.

190
00:10:07.92 --> 00:10:09.88
And so, I didn't want to take the pills.

191
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:12.40
And what causes that?

192
00:10:12.40 --> 00:10:15.68
Is it just the friction beat down on your legs, so it may long every day?

193
00:10:15.68 --> 00:10:19.88
Well, it's like, you know, your elbows are designed for, you know, certain amount of weight

194
00:10:19.88 --> 00:10:20.88
bearing, right?

195
00:10:20.88 --> 00:10:22.76
And the skin there, and can handle it.

196
00:10:22.76 --> 00:10:28.68
But now try weight bearing on your fore, you know, unless you really work at it, you know,

197
00:10:28.68 --> 00:10:32.36
and even then the skin there will never take weight like your elbows will.

198
00:10:32.36 --> 00:10:36.64
And that's what happens with prosthetics and with amputations.

199
00:10:36.64 --> 00:10:42.44
And so, I was also wearing my legs and what's called a suction, with a suction system.

200
00:10:42.44 --> 00:10:47.20
And so what that is is the liner around my, that I put over my leg before I put them

201
00:10:47.20 --> 00:10:50.16
into the socket has like a gasket.

202
00:10:50.16 --> 00:10:53.96
And it pushes the air out and it's a one way valve.

203
00:10:53.96 --> 00:10:56.48
And so then it's like, and so it's a vacuum, right?

204
00:10:56.48 --> 00:11:00.12
And so that vacuum was constantly pulling on the leg.

205
00:11:00.12 --> 00:11:05.88
And for most people that have no issue, but for whatever reason, and I looked around and

206
00:11:05.88 --> 00:11:10.36
I realized that most double below knee amputees use a sleeve.

207
00:11:10.36 --> 00:11:15.72
So now I use a sleeve, but at the time, because every layer is that much more dexterity

208
00:11:15.72 --> 00:11:18.08
lost in the movement of your knee, right?

209
00:11:18.08 --> 00:11:21.20
And I'm like, I was telling Echo before the show.

210
00:11:21.20 --> 00:11:23.24
Like I've done things with prosthetics.

211
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:27.12
I've most of the guys that make them are like, I've never seen anybody break it this way.

212
00:11:27.12 --> 00:11:30.44
Like, or I've never seen this type of damage or like you did what?

213
00:11:30.44 --> 00:11:33.68
Like you're not supposed to do these things with a double amputee.

214
00:11:33.68 --> 00:11:39.28
And so I just wanted the most mobility possible, but I was actually losing mobility because

215
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:41.12
of the pain that I was putting myself through.

216
00:11:41.12 --> 00:11:45.12
So my butt, my skin just couldn't handle that constant suction.

217
00:11:45.12 --> 00:11:50.48
And so I was drinking, you know, I toughed out my teeth and at the end of the day we

218
00:11:50.48 --> 00:11:54.80
go to the pub next to City Hall, I'll have a few drinks, talk, some politics.

219
00:11:54.80 --> 00:11:57.68
And usually I'm the last one there.

220
00:11:57.68 --> 00:12:01.64
And then like, you know, did it escalate to that?

221
00:12:01.64 --> 00:12:04.20
Where are you like, oh yeah, we're going to have a couple drinks.

222
00:12:04.20 --> 00:12:06.92
And then it's like, oh yeah, a couple drinks and most people are gone.

223
00:12:06.92 --> 00:12:08.48
It's all, I'm still fine.

224
00:12:08.48 --> 00:12:11.000
And then eventually you look around, you know, like all in the last person here.

225
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.60
Oh, and oh, it's been three weeks.

226
00:12:12.60 --> 00:12:14.000
So that's been the last person here.

227
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.20
It was like three months, yeah, it was six months.

228
00:12:16.20 --> 00:12:19.96
And then like, and I was known now, you know, and then in City Count, like the inside politics

229
00:12:19.96 --> 00:12:24.60
of City Hall was Jodie, you know, if you want a party called Jodie.

230
00:12:24.60 --> 00:12:26.92
You know, or for where's Jodie at that's where the fun is?

231
00:12:26.92 --> 00:12:31.04
And you know, and I'm not saying like it was like crazy things that you see on house

232
00:12:31.04 --> 00:12:32.24
of cards or anything like that.

233
00:12:32.24 --> 00:12:37.60
But if there was an event, I was there, you know, and again, like for a bit of it was

234
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:45.60
avoiding going home and dealing with that situation properly.

235
00:12:45.60 --> 00:12:49.08
And then the more pain I'm in, the more I'm drinking and then the more I'm drinking.

236
00:12:49.08 --> 00:12:53.12
And then you just put in yourself through more damage, right?

237
00:12:53.12 --> 00:12:57.04
Like you're out later, but because you're not feeling it, you're out later.

238
00:12:57.04 --> 00:12:58.96
Then you're causing more damage, right?

239
00:12:58.96 --> 00:13:02.08
So I move out fall of 16 and then it's spring of 17.

240
00:13:02.08 --> 00:13:03.60
My legs are just, they're done.

241
00:13:03.60 --> 00:13:07.08
They're just like, like, I, I came back.

242
00:13:07.08 --> 00:13:11.84
I did this thing in Canada called Canada Reeds and it's a national thing where you read

243
00:13:11.84 --> 00:13:14.76
a book and then you try to get it to win the contest.

244
00:13:14.76 --> 00:13:16.24
And it's a weak and Toronto.

245
00:13:16.24 --> 00:13:22.36
And I did that and I gritted my way through it and then I got home and I was at my old house

246
00:13:22.36 --> 00:13:27.24
with with my ex and my kids and and I took my legs off after because I just, I went

247
00:13:27.24 --> 00:13:31.72
there straight from the flight because I want to see the girls and I took my legs off and

248
00:13:31.72 --> 00:13:35.64
like she, like my ex, she was there the night I was wounded.

249
00:13:35.64 --> 00:13:40.28
And she said that she'd never heard me in the 10 years, she's known me make those types

250
00:13:40.28 --> 00:13:42.76
of sounds from pain.

251
00:13:42.76 --> 00:13:46.56
Because I took my legs off and it was, it was just like torture.

252
00:13:46.56 --> 00:13:51.84
Because while you have the pressure on and you're using them, like a kind of, you know,

253
00:13:51.84 --> 00:13:54.28
you spray in an ankle maybe, you know, and you go around on it.

254
00:13:54.28 --> 00:13:55.28
No, I'm not.

255
00:13:55.28 --> 00:13:57.88
Yeah, but at the end of the day when you get off, take the weight off.

256
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:00.44
That's when it really hurts.

257
00:14:00.44 --> 00:14:04.40
That's basically what happened and she was like, wow, I've never heard you make those noises.

258
00:14:04.40 --> 00:14:05.40
You must be in real pain.

259
00:14:05.40 --> 00:14:09.08
So after that, I just couldn't wear my legs anymore.

260
00:14:09.08 --> 00:14:12.88
And that's like, I mean, I saw you almost a year later, I was still in my wheelchair.

261
00:14:12.88 --> 00:14:14.12
Yeah.

262
00:14:14.12 --> 00:14:19.24
How much of that is, I know you were going hard, working hard.

263
00:14:19.24 --> 00:14:22.48
How much of that is because you're spending an extra three, four hours a day standing

264
00:14:22.48 --> 00:14:23.68
around at the bar drinking.

265
00:14:23.68 --> 00:14:27.44
How much of that is because the damage that alcohol is doing to your system.

266
00:14:27.44 --> 00:14:28.44
Yeah, yeah.

267
00:14:28.44 --> 00:14:29.72
How much of it is self-imposed?

268
00:14:29.72 --> 00:14:31.72
Good 50% I'd say.

269
00:14:31.72 --> 00:14:32.72
Yeah.

270
00:14:32.72 --> 00:14:36.96
I mean, just getting out of bed and putting the legs on hurt.

271
00:14:36.96 --> 00:14:37.96
And then, you know what I'd say?

272
00:14:37.96 --> 00:14:41.36
It's like again, when you, I always go to the ankle because I used to spray in them a lot

273
00:14:41.36 --> 00:14:42.84
when I had them.

274
00:14:42.84 --> 00:14:45.76
And that sucks as an infantry guy.

275
00:14:45.76 --> 00:14:48.84
But I learned how to tape them and I did some exercises.

276
00:14:48.84 --> 00:14:52.76
But, you know, like, getting into your boot or once you're in there, though, and you

277
00:14:52.76 --> 00:14:55.28
lace it up and you're usually good to go with it, right?

278
00:14:55.28 --> 00:14:59.72
So that's what I was doing every single morning for like a year.

279
00:14:59.72 --> 00:15:05.72
And then like, and then, you know, I'm just going to say it now, I started abusing cocaine.

280
00:15:05.72 --> 00:15:10.000
And to go because, you know, when you have a few drinks, you start to wobble.

281
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.52
And unfortunately, I picked up the habit after my first rotation Afghanistan.

282
00:15:14.52 --> 00:15:17.48
It was like, kind of like a seeking that thrill again.

283
00:15:17.48 --> 00:15:18.48
I don't know.

284
00:15:18.48 --> 00:15:21.24
I'm sure you've had a lot of troops tell you this type of thing.

285
00:15:21.24 --> 00:15:24.92
But, and it goes out of your system in a couple days.

286
00:15:24.92 --> 00:15:27.04
Whereas weed is there for months at a time.

287
00:15:27.04 --> 00:15:32.84
You know, and I don't know, I didn't touch anything since like high school when my buddy's

288
00:15:32.84 --> 00:15:34.44
hot mom sold hash.

289
00:15:34.44 --> 00:15:38.28
And me and my other buddy went hang out and I'd buy it.

290
00:15:38.28 --> 00:15:43.72
I never, I only spoke to like three times, but anyway, then you're out even longer.

291
00:15:43.72 --> 00:15:47.000
Then you're still wearing your legs even longer.

292
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.64
And, you know, and what was the, what was the, how did you just, you kind of just said,

293
00:15:52.64 --> 00:15:54.68
oh, yeah, I was drinking and then I was doing some cocaine.

294
00:15:54.68 --> 00:16:00.08
For me, that's a big step, like I mean, well, we need to, because here's the thing.

295
00:16:00.08 --> 00:16:03.44
I want people to understand what opened that door up.

296
00:16:03.44 --> 00:16:06.08
What made you say yourself, you know what?

297
00:16:06.08 --> 00:16:09.24
I'm a politician or I'm a wounded vet.

298
00:16:09.24 --> 00:16:11.08
I can do kind of whatever I want.

299
00:16:11.08 --> 00:16:12.28
Well, that was part of it.

300
00:16:12.28 --> 00:16:13.28
Yeah.

301
00:16:13.28 --> 00:16:23.80
I, because I had so much success and I was so much, you know, it was my name on the, on the door.

302
00:16:23.80 --> 00:16:28.96
And, and at first, like I went in with full intentions of being doing the honorable thing

303
00:16:28.96 --> 00:16:32.52
and this, and being, being a standup guy.

304
00:16:32.52 --> 00:16:37.64
And I think I was for a lot of part, but where I started going down is when it was the

305
00:16:37.64 --> 00:16:42.28
booze and the, and the Coke started to fill in the gaps where I should have been at home

306
00:16:42.28 --> 00:16:47.80
or in the gym or, or things like I was seeking immediate reward, you know, like I would,

307
00:16:47.80 --> 00:16:52.56
like say a power through a week of pain and, and like getting up early and going, because

308
00:16:52.56 --> 00:16:56.68
I was, you know, right up until I moved out of the house, like I was training for a bodybuilding

309
00:16:56.68 --> 00:16:57.68
show.

310
00:16:57.68 --> 00:17:00.28
I was looking good, I was feeling good, I was going here, I was going there.

311
00:17:00.28 --> 00:17:05.44
I kind of started feeling arrogant, you know, like, like, I'm, I'm jody medic and I work

312
00:17:05.44 --> 00:17:10.24
my ass off and I'm going to party my ass off this weekend because I can't.

313
00:17:10.24 --> 00:17:13.84
And then it went from the weekend to, okay, it's Thursday.

314
00:17:13.84 --> 00:17:18.88
You know, and we got no meetings tomorrow at City Hall, so I'm going to sleep in tomorrow

315
00:17:18.88 --> 00:17:21.44
because tonight I'm going, and there's always events.

316
00:17:21.44 --> 00:17:25.92
There's always events where you can go and eat and drink and meet people and look cool.

317
00:17:25.92 --> 00:17:31.44
And, and I was the guy who did amazing race, wrote a book, got, or got wounded and I've

318
00:17:31.44 --> 00:17:35.08
got a stand, powered his way back, that did, did I got elected, you know, like I was

319
00:17:35.08 --> 00:17:37.44
always on display, it felt, you know.

320
00:17:37.44 --> 00:17:41.52
So when I was allowed to be myself, I kind of just let loose, you know, I'd like to fuse

321
00:17:41.52 --> 00:17:43.000
on the, on the rocket.

322
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.88
And, was anyone advising you?

323
00:17:44.88 --> 00:17:47.80
Was anyone pulling you aside going, hey, bro, you know, tighten this up?

324
00:17:47.80 --> 00:17:51.40
No, because I was the man in my world.

325
00:17:51.40 --> 00:17:53.40
I was, I was in charge.

326
00:17:53.40 --> 00:18:03.000
Like, like, my assistant, he tried his best, but, you know, it's not something like, like,

327
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.52
even, even Kel, right, she was around for a little bit.

328
00:18:05.52 --> 00:18:08.80
Like, it's not something you just walk up and go, hey, Jocco, you know, fucking, sorry.

329
00:18:08.80 --> 00:18:12.52
Okay, hey, Jocco, are you doing Coke?

330
00:18:12.52 --> 00:18:15.96
You know, unless you have that relationship with someone, you can't just open that door,

331
00:18:15.96 --> 00:18:16.96
right?

332
00:18:16.96 --> 00:18:20.48
Like, it's your door, are you, are you, are you Jack and needles up your arm?

333
00:18:20.48 --> 00:18:21.48
Like, are you doing Harold?

334
00:18:21.48 --> 00:18:22.48
Like, you know what I mean?

335
00:18:22.48 --> 00:18:26.76
Like, you can't just, so, and like I said, I was the man in my life.

336
00:18:26.76 --> 00:18:29.92
My whole world was, like, I was so in charge.

337
00:18:29.92 --> 00:18:30.92
Yeah.

338
00:18:30.92 --> 00:18:32.64
I kind of drank my own cool aid for a while.

339
00:18:32.64 --> 00:18:33.80
You know what, I talk about it.

340
00:18:33.80 --> 00:18:35.60
You go obviously all the time.

341
00:18:35.60 --> 00:18:41.08
And one of the things I say when I talk about ego is, is when you start believing your own

342
00:18:41.08 --> 00:18:42.08
hype, right?

343
00:18:42.08 --> 00:18:43.08
Oh, bro, it's the worst.

344
00:18:43.08 --> 00:18:49.52
And if you put yourself in a position where no one even has the, the balls to come up to you

345
00:18:49.52 --> 00:18:53.24
and say, hey, I think you could do this a little bit differently.

346
00:18:53.24 --> 00:18:57.60
And even if they do, or they try and hint at it, you kind of steam roll them because you're

347
00:18:57.60 --> 00:18:58.92
the man.

348
00:18:58.92 --> 00:19:03.96
And this is what that situation is where you aren't looking at yourself thinking, okay,

349
00:19:03.96 --> 00:19:05.72
what am I really doing right now?

350
00:19:05.72 --> 00:19:06.72
How is this working out?

351
00:19:06.72 --> 00:19:11.20
Well, to, in my view for a long time, it had all worked out fine.

352
00:19:11.20 --> 00:19:12.20
Yeah.

353
00:19:12.20 --> 00:19:15.84
Which, which all that does is solidify your beliefs.

354
00:19:15.84 --> 00:19:17.28
Well, like, you're on the show.

355
00:19:17.28 --> 00:19:18.28
You come in second.

356
00:19:18.28 --> 00:19:19.96
You come in second with no legs.

357
00:19:19.96 --> 00:19:22.08
That's pretty much like, I'm pretty nice, right?

358
00:19:22.08 --> 00:19:24.60
I sprinted past a sprinter.

359
00:19:24.60 --> 00:19:27.20
Like that girl Selena, she was a sprinter in high school.

360
00:19:27.20 --> 00:19:29.96
And I sprinted past her, you know.

361
00:19:29.96 --> 00:19:36.80
And I'm getting older and, you know, my, you know, I'm just, I was, what, yeah, it just,

362
00:19:36.80 --> 00:19:41.08
but when it started being like it was a, it was a Saturday night and then it was a weekend

363
00:19:41.08 --> 00:19:43.28
day and then it was like a four day weekend.

364
00:19:43.28 --> 00:19:48.24
And then next thing I knew, I was out because, you know, I didn't need to go home.

365
00:19:48.24 --> 00:19:50.72
And I saw the kids on the weekends and stuff.

366
00:19:50.72 --> 00:19:54.64
So I just, I was able to manipulate my, and I'm the boss on my own schedule.

367
00:19:54.64 --> 00:19:55.000
Yeah.

368
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.92
You're manipulating everything, including yourself because you're, because you're

369
00:19:57.92 --> 00:19:58.92
a big professionalize.

370
00:19:58.92 --> 00:20:04.08
It's still funny because it's not like you don't see this play out over and over and

371
00:20:04.08 --> 00:20:07.16
over again with, with famous people, right?

372
00:20:07.16 --> 00:20:07.68
Every, every, every, every.

373
00:20:07.68 --> 00:20:13.48
Famous people that all the sudden they get a, they get a role in a movie or they, they do

374
00:20:13.48 --> 00:20:19.04
something they, they get recruited to a professional sports team and next thing you

375
00:20:19.04 --> 00:20:22.28
know, no one can tell them anything and they're going to go and they're going to go

376
00:20:22.28 --> 00:20:26.92
hard and the other thing that happens is you get surrounded with yes men.

377
00:20:26.92 --> 00:20:29.44
People that are just telling you, oh, yeah, yeah, you do whatever you want.

378
00:20:29.44 --> 00:20:33.56
And in my opinion, a lot of times those, yes men, they're, they're actually digging.

379
00:20:33.56 --> 00:20:38.04
They're, they're actually possibly, well, they're either trying to hook onto you and

380
00:20:38.04 --> 00:20:39.88
get what they can out of you and ride your coat.

381
00:20:39.88 --> 00:20:44.52
100% or there's someone that just looking to make you fall down because they're jealous.

382
00:20:44.52 --> 00:20:45.52
100%.

383
00:20:45.52 --> 00:20:49.92
I was surrounded by both and I'm not, and it, hey, if you were around me and you're

384
00:20:49.92 --> 00:20:53.64
listening to this, I'm not saying that was you, but there are some people that might

385
00:20:53.64 --> 00:20:58.32
be listening that know exactly what they were in my life at the time and looking back

386
00:20:58.32 --> 00:21:04.44
on it, it's like, you know, it's like doing a map, Ricky after the, after the mission or

387
00:21:04.44 --> 00:21:09.68
something and then you go, oh, how did I not see that right there, that object or that

388
00:21:09.68 --> 00:21:11.92
obstacle, right there, how did I miss that?

389
00:21:11.92 --> 00:21:12.92
Yeah.

390
00:21:12.92 --> 00:21:18.64
When it's so obvious, so, you know, I spent, so I think it's important to like just pause

391
00:21:18.64 --> 00:21:23.28
for a second though because people go into these situations all the time and what you have

392
00:21:23.28 --> 00:21:28.84
to do is you have to be, you have to do a map study like you're saying, you have to do a

393
00:21:28.84 --> 00:21:32.80
reconnaissance, you have to look around and say, hey, maybe I don't know exactly where

394
00:21:32.80 --> 00:21:35.96
I am, maybe I need to look for some of these obstacles, maybe I need to look for some

395
00:21:35.96 --> 00:21:40.16
of these obvious pitfalls that I'm going to look back in five years and I'm going to

396
00:21:40.16 --> 00:21:46.28
say, oh, that person was a leech or oh, I was being an idiot or oh, everyone was fueling

397
00:21:46.28 --> 00:21:48.92
the fire so they could get more out of me.

398
00:21:48.92 --> 00:21:52.28
And when, when that's the way it is, if you're aware of that, that you're going to get

399
00:21:52.28 --> 00:21:58.24
yourself in that situation, the problem is, the problem is you get in that situation,

400
00:21:58.24 --> 00:22:02.44
you're supposed to be self-aware, but you can't because you're in that situation.

401
00:22:02.44 --> 00:22:03.44
Right.

402
00:22:03.44 --> 00:22:04.64
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's

403
00:22:04.64 --> 00:22:08.84
an Italian man, when you're doing the amount of drinking and then the amount of drugs I was

404
00:22:08.84 --> 00:22:10.50
doing, you, it's impossible.

405
00:22:10.50 --> 00:22:18.16
Do your, your ability to think objectively and self like, yourself awareness dissolves.

406
00:22:18.16 --> 00:22:23.24
And guys like you and me and we're, you know, we're warriors, we're elite, that's in that,

407
00:22:23.24 --> 00:22:27.82
we are supposed to have it all together, but it's actually, it's super common in our, in

408
00:22:27.82 --> 00:22:30.04
our, in our, in our community.

409
00:22:30.04 --> 00:22:33.08
And it's because we're so used being on point.

410
00:22:33.08 --> 00:22:38.30
I think for me, what happened was I was so used to being on point that I just never

411
00:22:38.30 --> 00:22:39.30
occurred to me.

412
00:22:39.30 --> 00:22:42.24
I was, and it's a curse.

413
00:22:42.24 --> 00:22:48.12
My kids even, my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, my assistants, my a couple of good

414
00:22:48.12 --> 00:22:52.52
friends to kind of just start to turn the ship.

415
00:22:52.52 --> 00:22:56.48
And when I was here last time, the ship had just barely started to turn.

416
00:22:56.48 --> 00:23:05.48
I had just before we had drove down here, I had just quit drinking and at new years, which

417
00:23:05.48 --> 00:23:07.60
was actually pretty easy.

418
00:23:07.60 --> 00:23:11.48
And you know, I just, I hadn't used since we'd tired of the road trip.

419
00:23:11.48 --> 00:23:14.28
And we saw you, like I think in the last half of it.

420
00:23:14.28 --> 00:23:18.36
So, and I felt like, oh, I don't, obviously, I'm not addicted.

421
00:23:18.36 --> 00:23:21.48
I can go three weeks or whatever it was.

422
00:23:21.48 --> 00:23:27.40
And so, 2017 was the down and then 2018 was a bit of a leveling out.

423
00:23:27.40 --> 00:23:31.12
And then I had a hard crash right before New Year's this year.

424
00:23:31.12 --> 00:23:34.36
Or yeah, I guess, whatever, a couple months ago.

425
00:23:34.36 --> 00:23:39.04
And that's when her, Kelly, and everyone said, if you don't go to rehab, you're going to

426
00:23:39.04 --> 00:23:40.04
lose it all.

427
00:23:40.04 --> 00:23:42.96
So, I have to back up because I know, sorry, man.

428
00:23:42.96 --> 00:23:48.24
You jump like, you're like, oh, then it leveled and crashed and also we're good.

429
00:23:48.24 --> 00:23:52.68
Because for me, what I want to see is I want to be able to recognize the warning signs better.

430
00:23:52.68 --> 00:23:53.68
Right?

431
00:23:53.68 --> 00:23:54.68
Yeah, I know.

432
00:23:54.68 --> 00:23:56.68
And I'm, I'm, I'm glossing because it's me.

433
00:23:56.68 --> 00:24:03.24
Did you get in trouble with your governmental job, with your political position?

434
00:24:03.24 --> 00:24:08.76
Yeah, did people eventually say, because I remember at one point you missed a meeting.

435
00:24:08.76 --> 00:24:10.000
You missed some seven meetings.

436
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Yeah.

437
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.80
And all of a sudden it turned into a what's this guy's problem?

438
00:24:13.80 --> 00:24:18.52
Yeah, so in politics, you know, as much as your own boss and, you know, for a

439
00:24:18.52 --> 00:24:23.28
formidable level in Canada, I'd be, on Ontario because we don't have a party system at

440
00:24:23.28 --> 00:24:24.28
that level.

441
00:24:24.28 --> 00:24:25.88
Apparently you had your own party system.

442
00:24:25.88 --> 00:24:26.88
Oh, I brought it.

443
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:27.88
I was party.

444
00:24:27.88 --> 00:24:32.16
I, you know, I was the party.

445
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:35.40
The time when you're earning is when it's budget time.

446
00:24:35.40 --> 00:24:39.64
And that's where you're fighting for your, your community get the dollars that it deserves

447
00:24:39.64 --> 00:24:41.04
or the programs.

448
00:24:41.04 --> 00:24:42.04
Pardon me.

449
00:24:42.04 --> 00:24:47.16
Sorry, the programs that you believe in, you're there to say, I think that this needs

450
00:24:47.16 --> 00:24:49.72
more money or this, you know, shift.

451
00:24:49.72 --> 00:24:55.16
That's when you really make your money or make earn your pay as a politician, so to speak

452
00:24:55.16 --> 00:24:57.36
and, and I just stopped showing up.

453
00:24:57.36 --> 00:25:00.56
Like, you, you can mess up the whole year.

454
00:25:00.56 --> 00:25:03.52
But if you're not there for budget, that's when people start going, hey man, what's

455
00:25:03.52 --> 00:25:04.52
going on?

456
00:25:04.52 --> 00:25:08.80
And a really good friend of mine who's one of the biggest meetings of the year.

457
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:11.16
And I missed the most important things that you have to do.

458
00:25:11.16 --> 00:25:15.20
The most important things you have to do to represent the community that elected you and

459
00:25:15.20 --> 00:25:16.20
you're just not showing up.

460
00:25:16.20 --> 00:25:20.000
I just, yeah, just tell my won't be there today.

461
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.40
And my assistant is like, dude, I can't keep covering for you.

462
00:25:23.40 --> 00:25:27.60
You know, and a good, a good friend of mine who's out of so a big political reporter in

463
00:25:27.60 --> 00:25:33.44
Canada called me one day and he said, you need to meet me for lunch or you've just, like,

464
00:25:33.44 --> 00:25:36.52
you got to say something or else you're going down.

465
00:25:36.52 --> 00:25:37.52
And I was like, what?

466
00:25:37.52 --> 00:25:41.48
So I met him for lunch and I didn't, and I really didn't want to.

467
00:25:41.48 --> 00:25:46.56
And he's like, this is what's going to be said if you don't say anything.

468
00:25:46.56 --> 00:25:48.16
And he's like, I'm telling you this has a friend.

469
00:25:48.16 --> 00:25:51.52
I've known you since way before you were Joe D. Middick.

470
00:25:51.52 --> 00:25:57.04
I've known you for, and I respect you and you've always been straight and you've stopped.

471
00:25:57.04 --> 00:26:00.16
You're not being straight anymore and you're not being honest.

472
00:26:00.16 --> 00:26:01.40
You need to not answer in questions.

473
00:26:01.40 --> 00:26:04.36
And he's like, this is the world you're in now, dude.

474
00:26:04.36 --> 00:26:08.84
This is how you have to handle it. And so coming down and doing your show last time was kind

475
00:26:08.84 --> 00:26:10.44
of part of that come to Jesus.

476
00:26:10.44 --> 00:26:14.88
So when you once you did that, did you do like a story with that reporter and say, yeah,

477
00:26:14.88 --> 00:26:17.48
I've been, you did sort of a, I'm guilty.

478
00:26:17.48 --> 00:26:19.40
But I only just told half the story.

479
00:26:19.40 --> 00:26:21.12
Kind of like, like I was telling you.

480
00:26:21.12 --> 00:26:22.88
So half extreme ownership.

481
00:26:22.88 --> 00:26:24.44
I took half of the ownership.

482
00:26:24.44 --> 00:26:30.04
Yeah, I admitted to drinking, but I couldn't, I still didn't have it in me to admit

483
00:26:30.04 --> 00:26:31.60
to the drugs.

484
00:26:31.60 --> 00:26:35.68
And I didn't want was the reaction of the public on support.

485
00:26:35.68 --> 00:26:36.80
Mostly a lot of them.

486
00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:40.96
I mean, the positive, the best part of our politics is no matter how awesome you think

487
00:26:40.96 --> 00:26:45.20
you are, there's always someone, even if you are as awesome as you think you are, someone

488
00:26:45.20 --> 00:26:46.68
out there is going to say no you're not.

489
00:26:46.68 --> 00:26:52.80
And so I had 90% of the public say, you know, we understand and you've been through a

490
00:26:52.80 --> 00:26:55.56
lot in the SNAT and we support you.

491
00:26:55.56 --> 00:26:58.76
We're here for you and fight on and you're a fighter and, and it was love.

492
00:26:58.76 --> 00:27:03.12
And I took it in and, and it fueled me honestly for a long time through 2018.

493
00:27:03.12 --> 00:27:07.68
I really was trying and, and, you know, when I went back and did a few up to date.

494
00:27:07.68 --> 00:27:08.68
Stop drinking.

495
00:27:08.68 --> 00:27:09.68
Yeah, I could have you.

496
00:27:09.68 --> 00:27:10.68
Yeah, I quit drinking.

497
00:27:10.68 --> 00:27:12.04
Yeah, I quit drinking.

498
00:27:12.04 --> 00:27:15.20
We quit drinking both of us, quit drinking New Year's Eve.

499
00:27:15.20 --> 00:27:20.04
So the interview is December, I want to say 18thish, 2017.

500
00:27:20.04 --> 00:27:23.08
So New Year's Eve, we stopped drinking.

501
00:27:23.08 --> 00:27:29.28
And then I spent the rest of the year trying to, to, to rest of 2018, especially after

502
00:27:29.28 --> 00:27:32.32
the, I stopped wearing your shirts.

503
00:27:32.32 --> 00:27:33.32
Oh, okay.

504
00:27:33.32 --> 00:27:34.32
Good, right?

505
00:27:34.32 --> 00:27:37.32
The good with the face, those are the shirts I have of yours.

506
00:27:37.32 --> 00:27:42.08
I, I couldn't, like, in my mind, I, I didn't deserve it.

507
00:27:42.08 --> 00:27:44.24
I couldn't even, like, your books are up on the shelf.

508
00:27:44.24 --> 00:27:45.76
I couldn't even look at it.

509
00:27:45.76 --> 00:27:46.84
My book is up on a shelf.

510
00:27:46.84 --> 00:27:47.84
I couldn't look at it.

511
00:27:47.84 --> 00:27:52.88
I, um, 2018, I, like, yeah, I stopped drinking and I admitted to my

512
00:27:52.88 --> 00:27:58.04
problem, but then I had to deal with the emotional and psychological effects of

513
00:27:58.04 --> 00:28:02.04
realizing I'm a complete loser in my mind, right?

514
00:28:02.04 --> 00:28:05.16
Like, because as a kid, when you grew up, what was someone who did drugs, a

515
00:28:05.16 --> 00:28:06.16
loser?

516
00:28:06.16 --> 00:28:07.68
What was someone that could control himself?

517
00:28:07.68 --> 00:28:08.68
You could control himself.

518
00:28:08.68 --> 00:28:09.68
Do you know what I'm doing?

519
00:28:09.68 --> 00:28:16.44
Okay, you know, I did, I managed to stop for a bit, but, you know, my

520
00:28:16.44 --> 00:28:21.12
relationship with my, with my former partner was, was anything but, but

521
00:28:21.12 --> 00:28:22.12
awesome.

522
00:28:22.12 --> 00:28:25.76
And, you know, and it's not saying bad or good about me or her, but it's just,

523
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:28.16
like, that's what happens in a relationship, brings up.

524
00:28:28.16 --> 00:28:34.04
I'm under massive scrutiny by the public and the media now in Ottawa.

525
00:28:34.04 --> 00:28:38.96
I'm under, I'm under a lot of, just a lot of different stressors are coming in.

526
00:28:38.96 --> 00:28:43.60
You know, I, um, I just, I just couldn't get anything together.

527
00:28:43.60 --> 00:28:46.72
I managed to stop drinking and that was about my only success.

528
00:28:46.72 --> 00:28:52.92
So does the coke make you feel like a momentary, like, okay, I've got this?

529
00:28:52.92 --> 00:28:55.000
Or does it just cover it up?

530
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.92
It's funny how it makes you think of other things.

531
00:28:59.92 --> 00:29:02.36
At first, you just, everything is awesome.

532
00:29:02.36 --> 00:29:06.96
But eventually, it stops working and it starts being like, it's an opposite.

533
00:29:06.96 --> 00:29:09.20
And it's, it's just like they say it is.

534
00:29:09.20 --> 00:29:11.44
Eventually, it starts to try to rewire your brain.

535
00:29:11.44 --> 00:29:16.68
I remember coming off, oxy cotton and it was harder than getting wounded.

536
00:29:16.68 --> 00:29:21.80
And coming off coke isn't harder than getting wounded, but it's easier to get back on.

537
00:29:21.80 --> 00:29:22.80
Does that make sense?

538
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:26.52
I probably quit three times a week for a while there.

539
00:29:26.52 --> 00:29:29.68
Like I go to your three days and I'd be like, oh, I'm doing good today.

540
00:29:29.68 --> 00:29:34.20
I didn't, and then the slightest like push like that.

541
00:29:34.20 --> 00:29:35.32
I don't know if they can see it on the camera.

542
00:29:35.32 --> 00:29:36.64
I'm pushing the water bottle.

543
00:29:36.64 --> 00:29:37.64
See it?

544
00:29:37.64 --> 00:29:38.64
Oh, there it is.

545
00:29:38.64 --> 00:29:39.64
I'm pushing it.

546
00:29:39.64 --> 00:29:44.76
The slightest push one half a degree off my axis on the compass.

547
00:29:44.76 --> 00:29:45.76
And that was it.

548
00:29:45.76 --> 00:29:46.76
That was it.

549
00:29:46.76 --> 00:29:49.96
April and a bought, I didn't get, I didn't drink.

550
00:29:49.96 --> 00:29:52.92
But it was like, I need it.

551
00:29:52.92 --> 00:29:57.24
The slightest stressor and I would, and I'd go off.

552
00:29:57.24 --> 00:30:02.76
And I just, I stopped having the ability to deal with life's, my life's problems.

553
00:30:02.76 --> 00:30:07.96
And on top of it for a lot of that year, oh, no, well, twenty after I got back from

554
00:30:07.96 --> 00:30:13.36
the road trip where I saw you guys last, I did put my legs back on.

555
00:30:13.36 --> 00:30:18.96
But just like, not like just every time I felt like I was like, I'd go up a couple

556
00:30:18.96 --> 00:30:22.44
runs in the ladder, I'd fall back a couple.

557
00:30:22.44 --> 00:30:27.68
And I was making a progress, but not the kind of progress someone like me is used to.

558
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:30.92
Like I'm used to like being in control.

559
00:30:30.92 --> 00:30:32.60
And if I don't want to do something, I don't do it.

560
00:30:32.60 --> 00:30:35.16
And if I want to do something, I do it.

561
00:30:35.16 --> 00:30:40.16
And this is one of those ones. And I remember when I admitted to my psychologist,

562
00:30:40.16 --> 00:30:43.16
two thousand, I swindled two, two thousand nineish.

563
00:30:43.16 --> 00:30:51.36
Because like I said, I picked up, I tried cocaine back in 2003, four after my first

564
00:30:51.36 --> 00:30:53.36
road to Afghanistan.

565
00:30:53.36 --> 00:30:57.56
And you know, and I was like, oh, okay, I was like, cool, whatever.

566
00:30:57.56 --> 00:30:58.56
I didn't really do it.

567
00:30:58.56 --> 00:31:00.04
Think about it for a long time after.

568
00:31:00.04 --> 00:31:03.16
But she said, that one, that one can get you.

569
00:31:03.16 --> 00:31:06.16
She would just be careful.

570
00:31:06.16 --> 00:31:09.16
Oh, she actually said, watch out.

571
00:31:09.16 --> 00:31:12.16
But this is in 2009 after I'm wounded.

572
00:31:12.16 --> 00:31:15.16
She said, well, what do you do to strap to really stress?

573
00:31:15.16 --> 00:31:19.16
I'm like, well, you know, on the weekend, my girlfriend, I will drink and do a little.

574
00:31:19.16 --> 00:31:21.16
And she's like, what?

575
00:31:21.16 --> 00:31:22.16
Coke.

576
00:31:22.16 --> 00:31:24.16
She's like, yeah, you have a real casual way of saying this.

577
00:31:24.16 --> 00:31:26.16
So, well, sorry, man.

578
00:31:26.16 --> 00:31:29.16
It's my life, but it's see, because I admitted to her.

579
00:31:29.16 --> 00:31:32.16
Because I, like, no matter what, you need someone

580
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:34.16
that you need someone you can talk to.

581
00:31:34.16 --> 00:31:38.16
I have, I've always believed that you know what to sometimes people develop

582
00:31:38.16 --> 00:31:43.16
personalities that they manage to figure out how to make things happen.

583
00:31:43.16 --> 00:31:44.16
Right?

584
00:31:44.16 --> 00:31:47.16
So, for instance, some people, they just have a way of talking to you.

585
00:31:47.16 --> 00:31:53.16
You ever known someone that can, like, say something really horrible, but they,

586
00:31:53.16 --> 00:31:56.16
but then they say something else, they kind of like can recover from it.

587
00:31:56.16 --> 00:32:00.16
You don't feel all that bad or you get, so it sounds like maybe you develop

588
00:32:00.16 --> 00:32:04.16
the technique of being like just talking about this in such a way that people go, oh, you know,

589
00:32:04.16 --> 00:32:07.16
if he's talking about this, this is such controlled way and it's not that big of a deal.

590
00:32:07.16 --> 00:32:08.16
You know what?

591
00:32:08.16 --> 00:32:09.16
It's probably not that big of a deal.

592
00:32:09.16 --> 00:32:11.16
Because that's how you're talking about it to me.

593
00:32:11.16 --> 00:32:12.16
That's how I talked about it to myself.

594
00:32:12.16 --> 00:32:13.16
Yeah.

595
00:32:13.16 --> 00:32:17.16
Because I even had a military doctor, and I don't even know if this is a real thing.

596
00:32:17.16 --> 00:32:21.16
Tell me, I have an anti-addictive personality, right?

597
00:32:21.16 --> 00:32:24.16
You're getting the most, and this is what it's called.

598
00:32:24.16 --> 00:32:27.16
You're getting the biggest reinforcements for your bad behavior.

599
00:32:27.16 --> 00:32:32.16
But everything you do, you win and succeed even though you're doing stuff wrong.

600
00:32:32.16 --> 00:32:34.16
Imagine if I'd done everything sober.

601
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:36.16
You know what?

602
00:32:36.16 --> 00:32:40.16
But yeah, anyway, she said that, and that, and that, and then, you know what?

603
00:32:40.16 --> 00:32:45.16
I didn't even realize the, I don't even know what word to use.

604
00:32:45.16 --> 00:32:52.16
Like the fact that I almost lost my career in the 90s because I was with a friend who bought cocaine.

605
00:32:52.16 --> 00:32:55.16
And you can read that in the book, if, and I think we talked about it.

606
00:32:55.16 --> 00:32:56.16
Yeah, we talked about it.

607
00:32:56.16 --> 00:33:00.16
But, and I didn't, I'd never done it at that point, and I didn't want to do it,

608
00:33:00.16 --> 00:33:05.16
but I didn't want my friend to go alone into some sleazy, bark bar, and anyway.

609
00:33:05.16 --> 00:33:06.16
And here I am.

610
00:33:06.16 --> 00:33:09.16
Which is just all rationalization, by the way.

611
00:33:09.16 --> 00:33:10.16
Yeah, that's 100% rationalization.

612
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:14.16
That was a 97, here I am, in 2017, losing everything to cocaine.

613
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:16.16
Losing everything.

614
00:33:16.16 --> 00:33:19.16
And I thought oxy cotton was my problem, right?

615
00:33:19.16 --> 00:33:20.16
Or the booze.

616
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:25.16
And it turns out, like, I just, I couldn't slay this dragon, you know?

617
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:30.16
So, you know, 2018 was a lot of up and down, up and down, up and down.

618
00:33:30.16 --> 00:33:36.16
And, and yeah, I gloss over it because it's, there's too much to talk about on podcast.

619
00:33:36.16 --> 00:33:40.16
But you and I would message back every now and then, and even the last show you said,

620
00:33:40.16 --> 00:33:44.16
Yeah, oh, yeah, I went through my, you text, and, and I saw you said the, and me,

621
00:33:44.16 --> 00:33:51.16
oh, flanged me in this, and that, twenty-nine, eighteen was me figuring out how to regroup and reorganize.

622
00:33:51.16 --> 00:33:58.16
And, and I'm still, and I realized too, dude, like, anyone who's been wounded in action or hurt in life,

623
00:33:58.16 --> 00:34:05.16
recovery is, it takes, it takes, it's taken me 12 years, and I'm not even recovered from getting blown up yet.

624
00:34:05.16 --> 00:34:10.16
You know, right before the show we were talking about, and I think we probably talked about the first time as you're,

625
00:34:10.16 --> 00:34:12.16
because I recognize this a long time ago.

626
00:34:12.16 --> 00:34:15.16
I was prepared to die or get that awesome wound.

627
00:34:15.16 --> 00:34:18.16
I can brag about it at the barbecue when I'm old.

628
00:34:18.16 --> 00:34:22.16
We sent a lot of bandages and body bags that I've got to stand as a, as a force.

629
00:34:22.16 --> 00:34:24.16
And I think you guys did to it first.

630
00:34:24.16 --> 00:34:29.16
We didn't even think about all the career ending injuries that are possible, you know,

631
00:34:29.16 --> 00:34:31.16
because we are draftees.

632
00:34:31.16 --> 00:34:35.16
They were at the greatest generation work professional soldiers.

633
00:34:35.16 --> 00:34:41.16
I saw myself retiring at, I don't know what the age is here, but probably 55,

634
00:34:41.16 --> 00:34:50.16
Grizzled old sergeant or worn officer, you know, go and then teach, teach shooting at the Canadian Army sniper school,

635
00:34:50.16 --> 00:34:53.16
you know, as a, as a contractor or something, or I don't know.

636
00:34:53.16 --> 00:34:57.16
I just never saw myself not being a soldier.

637
00:34:57.16 --> 00:35:05.16
And, you know what, I realized this the other day, the politics was a bandaid, the TV shows, the books, the podcasts,

638
00:35:05.16 --> 00:35:10.16
these are all part of me finding a way, but I'm back, you know, I'm instructing shooting again,

639
00:35:10.16 --> 00:35:16.16
you know, with some of my friends, I'm back to advocating for veterans again, you know, which I can have time for.

640
00:35:16.16 --> 00:35:22.16
I'm trying to work, I quit, I could have run again for politics and one easily, even with all my troubles.

641
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:26.16
I, I, I didn't want to.

642
00:35:26.16 --> 00:35:29.16
I want to be like, Jocco, I want to work for myself.

643
00:35:29.16 --> 00:35:30.16
No, dude, listen.

644
00:35:30.16 --> 00:35:32.16
Well, I don't work for myself.

645
00:35:32.16 --> 00:35:37.16
But when you were, I think even the first or definitely the second time you came down and you're telling me about all this,

646
00:35:37.16 --> 00:35:42.16
all the stuff that you have to put up with every day, all these people you're doing with, and I just said, bro,

647
00:35:42.16 --> 00:35:50.16
why don't you just not do that job again because the job satisfaction that you're getting out of it is none.

648
00:35:50.16 --> 00:35:55.16
I mean, maybe you're getting a little bit, but basically you're knocking any real job satisfaction.

649
00:35:55.16 --> 00:36:00.16
You're having to say things that you don't really feel like saying, you're having to talk to people that you really don't feel like talking to.

650
00:36:00.16 --> 00:36:05.16
And meanwhile, you're dealing with the fact that you lost your legs in Afghanistan every freaking day is a,

651
00:36:05.16 --> 00:36:08.16
is a, is, is, is, has presents challenges anyways.

652
00:36:08.16 --> 00:36:12.16
And then you're presenting yourself with challenges that you don't enjoy.

653
00:36:12.16 --> 00:36:17.16
Because it's one thing to say, oh, I'm going to go, do, do, do, do today and it's a challenge,

654
00:36:17.16 --> 00:36:20.16
but that's a challenge I enjoy or, oh, I'm going to go for run today, but it's a challenge I enjoy.

655
00:36:20.16 --> 00:36:24.16
It's another thing to say, I'm going to go do this challenge that I do not like,

656
00:36:24.16 --> 00:36:25.16
and I don't get anything out of.

657
00:36:25.16 --> 00:36:26.16
Yeah.

658
00:36:26.16 --> 00:36:29.16
That to me was was, it was the first time we were being to me.

659
00:36:29.16 --> 00:36:34.16
It was the first time we met and we were at Echo's brothers company where your podcast was.

660
00:36:34.16 --> 00:36:40.16
And you, your advice rang, you know, Kelly and I had a long talk before I announced I wouldn't run again.

661
00:36:40.16 --> 00:36:47.16
And she said the same thing. She says, remember what Jocco said, the squeeze isn't worth the juice or like that's the way she put it.

662
00:36:47.16 --> 00:36:53.16
But that's, she was, because I, when I got home, I told her what we talked about and Kelly and I were just friends back then and stuff,

663
00:36:53.16 --> 00:36:59.16
but, you know, it, that was a big, my sister, my baby sister actually.

664
00:36:59.16 --> 00:37:05.16
She said, you know, I knew you wouldn't last in politics, not, and she, and it wasn't an insult.

665
00:37:05.16 --> 00:37:08.16
She said, you're just, you're not, you're not the right person.

666
00:37:08.16 --> 00:37:12.16
Like your personality isn't, isn't for the political side of things.

667
00:37:12.16 --> 00:37:13.16
Yeah.

668
00:37:13.16 --> 00:37:17.16
And, and I want to work for myself and I love my podcast is back up.

669
00:37:17.16 --> 00:37:23.16
We've done a couple episodes, you know, we're still figuring out Kelly and I want to do online coaching now for people.

670
00:37:23.16 --> 00:37:25.16
Like we've got some hard miles between us.

671
00:37:25.16 --> 00:37:32.16
So we want to try and help people avoid some of the things we've gone through and I'm, and we're starting to like wander.

672
00:37:32.16 --> 00:37:38.16
I'm becoming like the guy in, we're, we, we, I should say, because we're a team.

673
00:37:38.16 --> 00:37:42.16
We're like the guy in Kung Fu. We just wander, we're just going to wander.

674
00:37:42.16 --> 00:37:46.16
We're just going to wander the earth and, and bank our own schedule.

675
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:50.16
And, but we, you know what, we do more work in a day now.

676
00:37:50.16 --> 00:37:54.16
Like it doesn't seem like work, but we, we get more accomplished in a day or two now.

677
00:37:54.16 --> 00:37:57.16
And we use two in two weeks because it's for ourselves.

678
00:37:57.16 --> 00:38:00.16
And it's just, and it's fun now.

679
00:38:00.16 --> 00:38:04.16
But I mean, when we're just starting, but I mean, you know, back to the story.

680
00:38:04.16 --> 00:38:09.16
I just, um, I lost myself and I finally have come.

681
00:38:09.16 --> 00:38:14.16
I think close to full circle back to who I was, except, you know, I'm 42.

682
00:38:14.16 --> 00:38:22.16
And I accept that I lost my legs and I accept that my career ended and I accept that I'm a complete mess up if I let myself be.

683
00:38:22.16 --> 00:38:25.16
And I accept that I'm a human being because of it.

684
00:38:25.16 --> 00:38:33.16
Because I don't know anyone who doesn't have any flaws, but you're your extreme ownership and the way I,

685
00:38:33.16 --> 00:38:40.16
I've always, even before I had a term extreme ownership, ask anyone who knows me.

686
00:38:40.16 --> 00:38:46.16
I might not tell you all the things about me or about my life, but I'm not going to bullshit you.

687
00:38:46.16 --> 00:38:50.16
And I'm not going to lie about things that don't matter.

688
00:38:50.16 --> 00:38:55.16
And I know everything matters if something can matter if you're not lying about something because it doesn't matter.

689
00:38:55.16 --> 00:38:58.16
But there's some things that aren't under your business.

690
00:38:58.16 --> 00:39:08.16
But I even, you know, anyone that knows me knows that I don't bullshit for the most part, you know, because, you know, sometimes I'll mess with it with you, just for fun.

691
00:39:08.16 --> 00:39:18.16
But, and, and that's just the way I want to live my life and, and I was bullshitting myself, you, you, her, my kids, the public,

692
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:22.16
all the people that supported me supported me for half truth.

693
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:31.16
This is why I told you, your listeners deserve to have Jody Middick come back and say, hey guys, because a lot of your listeners grow like dude.

694
00:39:31.16 --> 00:39:41.16
I, you know, I don't want to tear up or anything because I'm a man or, you know, whatever, but I, I get a message, minimum one a week since the last show, minimum.

695
00:39:41.16 --> 00:39:52.16
Often it's four, five, ten, hey man, heard you on Joco, thanks for being so truthful about your problems and it helped me quit drinking here.

696
00:39:52.16 --> 00:40:01.16
It helped me get back into Jim and it did, and I'm like, fine, I had to come back and just say hey guys, like, you're, you're back in the gym.

697
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:08.16
I haven't been to the gym since October 2016, you know, I know you can't believe it, but, uh, good genetics.

698
00:40:08.16 --> 00:40:28.16
But, I mean, I'm just saying, like, I felt like a fraud dude and I hated it and like she would watch me like just, I would get a message and I'd be like, you know, I'd like throw the phone and she'd be like, you get another message from someone who heard John Joco and I'm like, yeah, and my podcast is in order to be found in the book.

699
00:40:28.16 --> 00:40:38.16
I could have made twice as much money on that book if I had been put together enough up here to tour with it more, to go out with it and I still could have done my job.

700
00:40:38.16 --> 00:40:50.16
But I was compromising myself so much on the, on the, on the front end that on the back and I couldn't keep it up, you know, so I had to, it was like, do do politics? Well, or do the book well, can't do both well.

701
00:40:50.16 --> 00:41:00.16
I stopped being able to multitask and everything and I just wanted to come on the show and say, sorry to you guys and all the listeners and just say, and I know a lot of them will say, you don't know us, I owe you.

702
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:03.16
And for me, treat, please, you know, I owe you guys.

703
00:41:03.16 --> 00:41:15.16
You guys supported me, but you deserve the truth and the truth is I was doing a lot more than drinking and I did 30 days in rehab at the end of the, when did I go in?

704
00:41:15.16 --> 00:41:24.16
Right after Christmas and I am back on a path of righteousness. If you want to call it that, I am trying to atone.

705
00:41:24.16 --> 00:41:31.16
I'm trying to rebuild some bridges I burned and I've had people not return my call and I don't blame them.

706
00:41:31.16 --> 00:41:44.16
I was, I was, I was that guy you see in the movies for a good solid three, three months there at the end of the year. I could, I could, I went full, I, I don't want to say that word, but I went, I just, I went full, full dummy.

707
00:41:44.16 --> 00:41:49.16
And I, and I realized it and you know, so that's anyway why I'm here.

708
00:41:49.16 --> 00:41:56.16
Was there a point, what, what led you to say that you were going to go to rehab?

709
00:41:56.16 --> 00:42:05.16
Well, I mean, for the cliche is, you know, what was rock bottom at, what point did you look yourself and say, damn, I got to get my shit together now.

710
00:42:05.16 --> 00:42:13.16
My girls needed me. Kelly needed me, my mom needed me, my dad, my, if, if everyone in your life is telling you,

711
00:42:13.16 --> 00:42:17.16
there's a problem, there's a problem.

712
00:42:17.16 --> 00:42:33.16
And they managed to get through the static that was in my head and Kelly has had some serious health issues that weren't being helped by my behavior, just say the least.

713
00:42:33.16 --> 00:42:39.16
She suffered, do you mind if I told them? So she had a historic to me, right?

714
00:42:39.16 --> 00:42:47.16
In twenty, twenty, seventeen, which is all part of the story, and she almost died on the operate, or she then got sepsis and then almost died.

715
00:42:47.16 --> 00:42:51.16
And at the time, our relationship wasn't an open thing.

716
00:42:51.16 --> 00:42:58.16
And I couldn't be there for her and then my leg stopped working and we couldn't be there for each other even in private.

717
00:42:58.16 --> 00:43:02.16
And, and, and then so that was twenty, seventeen.

718
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:17.16
So she's trying to look after me and herself and her and her own relationship changing. But anyway, so she had, she had a cardiac moment from the stress of watching me destroy myself.

719
00:43:17.16 --> 00:43:19.16
So Kelly had a cardiac moment.

720
00:43:19.16 --> 00:43:29.16
My daughters were crying, you know, where's daddy? Where are you always? And then you're always late to get us or, and then when we're with you, you sleep.

721
00:43:29.16 --> 00:43:39.16
And, and my mom, you know, for my mom and my dad to agree on something, which is Jody needs help was another light bulb.

722
00:43:39.16 --> 00:43:44.16
And I was still in here somewhere. Like, Jody was still there.

723
00:43:44.16 --> 00:43:52.16
And trying is best and and being so self reflective and if you ever have to go in through anything like this, it's again, this is something.

724
00:43:52.16 --> 00:43:59.16
You can't, no one can describe. And everybody's is different. And now you're looking for the rock bottom. I had a couple.

725
00:43:59.16 --> 00:44:09.16
And every one of them was in my, and from my point of view, my relationship with the people I love was on thin ice.

726
00:44:09.16 --> 00:44:17.16
You know, if my best friend, my soul mate and my future wife, the person I want to marry, is saying,

727
00:44:17.16 --> 00:44:29.16
my health cannot sustain this. So I will have to leave you because from from my own health. Never mind you, your, my health.

728
00:44:29.16 --> 00:44:34.16
That's when I was like, okay, well, obviously, obviously, I got it. This isn't working.

729
00:44:34.16 --> 00:44:42.16
What does it look like day to day when you're doing so much cocaine that it's causing all these issues? Because I actually don't know. You know,

730
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:54.16
I probably never will know hopefully. Yeah. And if you do, I'll fly down here and we'll figure it out. But that's the thing is, you honestly believe everyone's against you.

731
00:44:54.16 --> 00:45:01.16
You honestly believe there's no right move you can make, except calling that guy who has the stuff.

732
00:45:01.16 --> 00:45:10.16
And then, and even though I got to a point where I knew exactly where doing the coke would lead and I didn't care.

733
00:45:10.16 --> 00:45:17.16
I'd waste another day or another. Usually it was three days or were completely wasted.

734
00:45:17.16 --> 00:45:21.16
Because what, what does that look like when you waste your days? You buy a bunch of cocaine.

735
00:45:21.16 --> 00:45:29.16
You do a bunch and then, you know, you can only do so much right before you just feel like you physically just can't do more than you can.

736
00:45:29.16 --> 00:45:37.16
Or you could, and you know, and because of who I am and the way my mind works, I'm always aware of, okay, there's ODEANG as possible.

737
00:45:37.16 --> 00:45:46.16
There's just your body can physically give out if you're, like your body needs sleep, right? We're trained for that, like we're trained like, and so I didn't have all this information.

738
00:45:46.16 --> 00:46:00.16
And also, you know, I knew a guy who is Canadian special operations regiment. I didn't really know him that well, but in his mind, and he would break, you would say, I know what, I'm going to, if I'm going to die in a room for the cocaine and hookers.

739
00:46:00.16 --> 00:46:08.16
And he did, he did it to him, but he wanted to. I didn't want to die, I have no interest in dying.

740
00:46:08.16 --> 00:46:17.16
So, you know, I have all these factors and then it's weird, but at near the end, I was, oh, sorry, and here's another rock bottom moment.

741
00:46:17.16 --> 00:46:19.16
I started buying booze again.

742
00:46:19.16 --> 00:46:24.16
Because booze and coke, like, one brings you up and then the other one brings you down.

743
00:46:24.16 --> 00:46:27.16
And they kind of, that's why they go together so well.

744
00:46:27.16 --> 00:46:31.16
If that's what you're looking for, but don't kids, okay?

745
00:46:31.16 --> 00:46:37.16
So when you do a bunch of coke, what do you, when you say you waste three days, what are you doing?

746
00:46:37.16 --> 00:46:40.16
Nothing. It's not like hyperproductive. Hey, I'm going to go right now.

747
00:46:40.16 --> 00:46:46.16
You know, I've got not when you're in the state of mind. I was at first, yeah, a little bit,

748
00:46:46.16 --> 00:46:52.16
would take you through the weekend and you'd get your email inbox will be empty and might not make.

749
00:46:52.16 --> 00:46:57.16
Some of your replies might not make a lot of sense, but you get through them. You might read that book,

750
00:46:57.16 --> 00:47:01.16
you've been wanting to do it and you might binge watch, like friends or something.

751
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:07.16
You know, I binge watched a lot of mindless TV on Coke, like friends.

752
00:47:07.16 --> 00:47:14.16
How I met your mother, the showhouse, scrubs, things that didn't matter, because I couldn't watch.

753
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:18.16
I love documentaries, but I couldn't watch them because they made me too sad.

754
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:23.16
And then I couldn't watch ones that were about people like success stories because I'd feel like a failure.

755
00:47:23.16 --> 00:47:27.16
So I watched all this meaningless TV. And that's what I would do.

756
00:47:27.16 --> 00:47:31.16
She'd come by and I'd be watching episode 300 of How I Met Your Mother.

757
00:47:31.16 --> 00:47:36.16
I have a piece of, I have a pizza box there with one slice, with one bite out of it.

758
00:47:36.16 --> 00:47:40.16
And maybe I was drinking like a protein shake or something.

759
00:47:40.16 --> 00:47:43.16
You know, because I had to hide, you got to hide right, bro. You got to hide right.

760
00:47:43.16 --> 00:47:51.16
You got to hide right. And so I, and she'd show up with a six pack of gatorade and alpha brain or like another generic new tropic.

761
00:47:51.16 --> 00:47:54.16
Because I was the thing, I was like, oh, as long as I got my new tropics.

762
00:47:54.16 --> 00:47:57.16
Yeah, but, um, and so that's three days.

763
00:47:57.16 --> 00:48:02.16
And because I wasn't wearing my legs, I literally sat on the couch, like look at my posture right now.

764
00:48:02.16 --> 00:48:08.16
This is from sitting on the couch for like a year straight. Like I got to like work now.

765
00:48:08.16 --> 00:48:13.16
You know, and I, uh, and yeah, man, you just, some of your behavior is inexplainable.

766
00:48:13.16 --> 00:48:19.16
And I'll tell you right now, I did some, some behavior that I'm just like, you know, I don't know.

767
00:48:19.16 --> 00:48:25.16
It's, it's, I don't know if I'll, and then I wasn't evil or anything, but I was not a good guy.

768
00:48:25.16 --> 00:48:30.16
I was not a good guy. I'm lucky to have her next to me. I'm lucky to have that my kids still talked to me.

769
00:48:30.16 --> 00:48:33.16
I'm lucky my mom didn't disown me, you know.

770
00:48:33.16 --> 00:48:38.16
Um, and at the end of the day, they all came together and I, I sucked it up.

771
00:48:38.16 --> 00:48:43.16
I manned up, I took ownership and I went to rehab and I threw my, I did what I did in my book.

772
00:48:43.16 --> 00:48:47.16
You know, that, that line where I say, I went back to, to training.

773
00:48:47.16 --> 00:48:51.16
Like I got sent to, as punishment, I got sent back to the battle school.

774
00:48:51.16 --> 00:48:52.16
Yeah.

775
00:48:52.16 --> 00:48:56.16
Um, and I had a choice. I could be the asshole that I was the first time.

776
00:48:56.16 --> 00:49:02.16
Or I could show up in shape with my boots polished in my uniform iron and be the best candidate.

777
00:49:02.16 --> 00:49:07.16
And I did that and I went to rehab and I did that.

778
00:49:07.16 --> 00:49:12.16
And then within 30 days, they were offering me a job.

779
00:49:12.16 --> 00:49:17.16
I got one more question about the bottom.

780
00:49:17.16 --> 00:49:20.16
So you, you basically, this happens for three days.

781
00:49:20.16 --> 00:49:23.16
You buy enough cocaine for three days.

782
00:49:23.16 --> 00:49:26.16
And then you're watching TV, you're eating pizza, you're sitting around.

783
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:29.16
You're just in a bad place.

784
00:49:29.16 --> 00:49:36.16
Then you run out of cocaine and then when you are not high anymore from the cocaine,

785
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:39.16
are you like, okay, I just want to get more cocaine.

786
00:49:39.16 --> 00:49:41.16
Is that basically what happens?

787
00:49:41.16 --> 00:49:45.16
Um, usually you go through a period of self-loathing.

788
00:49:45.16 --> 00:49:49.16
Okay, I was going to say, at any point, when you, when you, when you sober up and you go,

789
00:49:49.16 --> 00:49:52.16
Dang, why, why am I doing this?

790
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:53.16
Like, I mean, yeah.

791
00:49:53.16 --> 00:50:00.16
Yeah, a lot, but also it's a joke in the community, or those that in that per take,

792
00:50:00.16 --> 00:50:06.16
because it's called the cocaine blues, because your system has been in high-jacked and hard-wired

793
00:50:06.16 --> 00:50:09.16
and it's kind of like when you nitrous your engine, right?

794
00:50:09.16 --> 00:50:12.16
And you just nitrous it till it red lines.

795
00:50:12.16 --> 00:50:15.16
Eventually there's nothing left.

796
00:50:15.16 --> 00:50:16.16
So that's what happens.

797
00:50:16.16 --> 00:50:22.16
As soon as you let the nitrous out, the engine kind of like goes, it has no power for a while.

798
00:50:22.16 --> 00:50:25.16
And until it cools off, and that's basically what you go through.

799
00:50:25.16 --> 00:50:29.16
And the only way to remedy it, if you let's you power through the three to three,

800
00:50:29.16 --> 00:50:33.16
two, three days or the week, depending on how long your binge was,

801
00:50:33.16 --> 00:50:37.16
till your serotonin levels come back, and it takes, it can take,

802
00:50:37.16 --> 00:50:41.16
and at this point, I was abusing for a year, right?

803
00:50:41.16 --> 00:50:42.16
Like, steady.

804
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:45.16
Well, actually, by the end of last year, it was two years, steady.

805
00:50:45.16 --> 00:50:49.16
Twenty, seventeen, twenty, eighteen are basically a right off for me.

806
00:50:49.16 --> 00:50:52.16
As much as I got certain things done a lot of it was a right off,

807
00:50:52.16 --> 00:50:57.16
but you go through, as soon as it's done, you're like, I'm never doing this again.

808
00:50:57.16 --> 00:50:59.16
Oh my god, I can't eat coke.

809
00:50:59.16 --> 00:51:01.16
I'd call her and I'd be like, I'm sorry, I can't believe I did it.

810
00:51:01.16 --> 00:51:04.16
She'd be like, all right, well, I kind of heard that before, you know,

811
00:51:04.16 --> 00:51:06.16
at first it was optimism.

812
00:51:06.16 --> 00:51:08.16
Okay, good, yeah, we'll work on this together, and then,

813
00:51:08.16 --> 00:51:10.16
but then, you know what?

814
00:51:10.16 --> 00:51:12.16
And then I like I said, you know, remember when I said an inch,

815
00:51:12.16 --> 00:51:15.16
off your as a myth or whatever?

816
00:51:15.16 --> 00:51:17.16
Now it's like a millimeter.

817
00:51:17.16 --> 00:51:21.16
And you're like, all right, and unfortunately the guy delivers.

818
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:24.16
You know, so you don't even have to get, you don't even have to get dressed.

819
00:51:24.16 --> 00:51:28.16
You just come to the door and like, you know, and then put it on my tap.

820
00:51:28.16 --> 00:51:32.16
And, you know, and yeah, and even when, and when that guy says,

821
00:51:32.16 --> 00:51:35.16
are you sure that's another indication?

822
00:51:35.16 --> 00:51:38.16
Like when the guy who makes money off you being an idiot,

823
00:51:38.16 --> 00:51:43.16
thinks you're an idiot, you got to start thinking about life choices.

824
00:51:43.16 --> 00:51:47.16
And, you know, I did it.

825
00:51:47.16 --> 00:51:48.16
I went through a man.

826
00:51:48.16 --> 00:51:51.16
Again, I'm here to tell the truth to you and the listeners

827
00:51:51.16 --> 00:51:53.16
because they're watching us if they're on YouTube.

828
00:51:53.16 --> 00:51:56.16
Like, I can't hide it.

829
00:51:56.16 --> 00:52:00.16
And to pretend I just had some issues.

830
00:52:00.16 --> 00:52:03.16
Like a lot of people you hear in the media, right?

831
00:52:03.16 --> 00:52:05.16
Oh, they're having some issues.

832
00:52:05.16 --> 00:52:06.16
Just say what it is, man.

833
00:52:06.16 --> 00:52:10.16
It's just what soon as I went on the show in Ottawa,

834
00:52:10.16 --> 00:52:14.16
the same guy who came to me and I did the, and I went on a show

835
00:52:14.16 --> 00:52:17.16
and I said it, I said I did cocaine.

836
00:52:17.16 --> 00:52:20.16
I felt like a thousand pounds man off my shoulders.

837
00:52:20.16 --> 00:52:23.16
And he's like, I did not expect that.

838
00:52:23.16 --> 00:52:26.16
I said, I know man, and that's how much of a bullshit artist

839
00:52:26.16 --> 00:52:28.16
I became and I hate it.

840
00:52:28.16 --> 00:52:29.16
I hate it.

841
00:52:29.16 --> 00:52:34.16
My ex even said once he said, you weren't a sneaky bullshitter before.

842
00:52:34.16 --> 00:52:36.16
You know, you got to stop this.

843
00:52:36.16 --> 00:52:41.16
And you know, it's, you know, the extreme ownership comes in here

844
00:52:41.16 --> 00:52:46.16
because even when I, you know, when I first back 20 years ago

845
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:50.16
when I first got sent back to training as punishment for being an idiot,

846
00:52:50.16 --> 00:52:51.16
I owned it.

847
00:52:51.16 --> 00:52:54.16
Anyone who said, hey, you've got to go to rest in Chicago.

848
00:52:54.16 --> 00:52:56.16
I'd be like, well, I didn't have it, but yeah, yeah, that was me.

849
00:52:56.16 --> 00:52:58.16
Because what are you going to do?

850
00:52:58.16 --> 00:52:59.16
Say you know.

851
00:52:59.16 --> 00:53:02.16
Like, you know, and I always tried to live that way

852
00:53:02.16 --> 00:53:05.16
and I lost myself to this stuff.

853
00:53:05.16 --> 00:53:08.16
And I was stopping honest with everyone, especially myself.

854
00:53:08.16 --> 00:53:10.16
And that's saying that you got to look after yourself

855
00:53:10.16 --> 00:53:15.16
before you can look after anybody else is a 150% true.

856
00:53:15.16 --> 00:53:18.16
You know, even, and Kelly even learned some lessons here.

857
00:53:18.16 --> 00:53:21.16
Because she didn't take enough time to recover from her surgery.

858
00:53:21.16 --> 00:53:23.16
And it almost killed her again, you know.

859
00:53:23.16 --> 00:53:26.16
And she was worried about that work and her kids.

860
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:28.16
And this, you got to worry about yourself.

861
00:53:28.16 --> 00:53:33.16
And again, man, I'm on like a redemption to her almost, I feel like.

862
00:53:33.16 --> 00:53:35.16
And I love it.

863
00:53:35.16 --> 00:53:36.16
I love it.

864
00:53:36.16 --> 00:53:39.16
Like we were, we were, we were, we were.

865
00:53:39.16 --> 00:53:42.16
I figured we were, but, you know, somebody said something.

866
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:44.16
I went, oh, yeah, I just got to rehab for cocaine.

867
00:53:44.16 --> 00:53:46.16
And they went, oh, okay.

868
00:53:46.16 --> 00:53:49.16
So coffee, because I think they wanted to get a drink.

869
00:53:49.16 --> 00:53:51.16
And I'm like, yeah, I just got to rehab.

870
00:53:51.16 --> 00:53:55.16
You know, it's a great conversation starter or tender.

871
00:53:55.16 --> 00:53:57.16
So it's talked to me about rehab.

872
00:53:57.16 --> 00:53:59.16
What goes on there?

873
00:53:59.16 --> 00:54:05.16
You know, it's a whole lot of just being told to think about how you're living your life.

874
00:54:05.16 --> 00:54:10.16
I did, I did, usually for cocaine, they want 90 days.

875
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:12.16
I was only willing to commit to 30.

876
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:18.16
Because I still had a little bit of like that ego going and stuff.

877
00:54:18.16 --> 00:54:21.16
And I did the 30 and I did okay.

878
00:54:21.16 --> 00:54:28.16
And like I said, they were offering me a job or like, you know, we were in talks about maybe working there.

879
00:54:28.16 --> 00:54:37.16
But you know, it's funny how like once you open your mind to possibilities,

880
00:54:37.16 --> 00:54:41.16
the way forward is obvious.

881
00:54:41.16 --> 00:54:49.16
I have no business being in this town called Brockville, where the rehab place was.

882
00:54:49.16 --> 00:54:54.16
But if I wasn't there, Kelly and I wouldn't have found this building that when I was sending you,

883
00:54:54.16 --> 00:55:01.16
where it which inspired us to remind us that two years ago when we first moved out of our house or three years ago, no, holy crap.

884
00:55:01.16 --> 00:55:09.16
Almost three years ago now when we first moved out from our old relationships and we're trying to establish our own.

885
00:55:09.16 --> 00:55:13.16
My goal before I got elected was I wanted to open a gym.

886
00:55:13.16 --> 00:55:16.16
And I wanted to build a community of positive people.

887
00:55:16.16 --> 00:55:21.16
And I wanted to like wake up every morning, have a coffee, like, I don't know why,

888
00:55:21.16 --> 00:55:25.16
but in my mind, I have an image of me in shorts with a long sleeve t-shirt,

889
00:55:25.16 --> 00:55:29.16
opening up like a garage door and having like people come in with gym bags.

890
00:55:29.16 --> 00:55:31.16
Like, hey, Jodi, how's it going? Good morning, sir.

891
00:55:31.16 --> 00:55:39.16
You know, like, and not sir, like, hey, sir, but like, because I'm like, I'm like the leader or like, I'm the, I'm the pop-up bear of this group.

892
00:55:39.16 --> 00:55:42.16
That's what we Kelly and I call ourselves mama and pop-up bear.

893
00:55:42.16 --> 00:55:48.16
And even in rehab, they started calling me pop-up bear because I'd be like, I was almost twice as old as most of the people there.

894
00:55:48.16 --> 00:55:53.16
Most of them were like late teens early, 20s, maybe 30, some of them were 30,

895
00:55:53.16 --> 00:55:57.16
but, you know, even the older people, like there was like one woman there in her 60s.

896
00:55:57.16 --> 00:56:00.16
And she'd be like, hey, pop-up bear because that's just who we are.

897
00:56:00.16 --> 00:56:03.16
Like, you're the same, you're like me, but like, and Kelly's the same.

898
00:56:03.16 --> 00:56:06.16
And we just, we want to look after people. We can't help it, right?

899
00:56:06.16 --> 00:56:09.16
You know, and the rehab people would look after yourself.

900
00:56:09.16 --> 00:56:13.16
But anyway, Kelly comes and picks me up and I'm allowed, I can give in a day pass.

901
00:56:13.16 --> 00:56:16.16
You know, like, oh, they let you go out for the day if you're good.

902
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:19.16
If you're good boy, I go, they let you go out on rehab.

903
00:56:19.16 --> 00:56:23.16
And so we're driving around that so when I saw that building, I think I sent you picture too.

904
00:56:23.16 --> 00:56:24.16
Yeah, nice.

905
00:56:24.16 --> 00:56:30.16
1905, this thing was a woodmill, a beautiful, big wooden beams, like a beautiful building.

906
00:56:30.16 --> 00:56:34.16
Unfortunately, it would have been more to repair it than it would have been to buy it.

907
00:56:34.16 --> 00:56:39.16
But it put our minds on this path to what a great area that is.

908
00:56:39.16 --> 00:56:43.16
The fact that we want to go back on this path of building this community.

909
00:56:43.16 --> 00:56:47.16
So we want to build, so we're still doing it.

910
00:56:47.16 --> 00:56:52.16
And we should, you should, you should, Kelly and I drive a lot because we have our best meetings.

911
00:56:52.16 --> 00:56:54.16
Our business meetings are when we're driving.

912
00:56:54.16 --> 00:57:01.16
And so we want to open what's called HQ and it's going to be a fitness wellness center.

913
00:57:01.16 --> 00:57:05.16
And, and it's going to be more of a community than anything.

914
00:57:05.16 --> 00:57:08.16
Kind of like, if you want to just come chill, you can come chill.

915
00:57:08.16 --> 00:57:11.16
We're going to have, I want to have a library. I want to have a podcast studio.

916
00:57:11.16 --> 00:57:17.16
We have classrooms and, you know, and we're going to just be there to help you live a better life.

917
00:57:17.16 --> 00:57:22.16
And, and the best way for me to live a good life is to help you live a good life.

918
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:28.16
And I've realized that now, like even when I was in my military unit, like, even if I wasn't hungry,

919
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:30.16
I'd grab extra food and bring it back to the boys.

920
00:57:30.16 --> 00:57:34.16
You know, if I, if I realized like there was something shiny around to be had,

921
00:57:34.16 --> 00:57:39.16
I'd like find a way to get my hands on it for the for the team and stuff, you know.

922
00:57:39.16 --> 00:57:42.16
I'm my happiest when I'm looking out for others.

923
00:57:42.16 --> 00:57:46.16
And I know, and at the same time, though, you know, they're looking out for you.

924
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:51.16
And, and it feels good to have friends and family and, you know, a tribe around you, right?

925
00:57:51.16 --> 00:57:53.16
Like, you know, we're tribal animals.

926
00:57:53.16 --> 00:57:57.16
And I, you know, do you know what, date fletcher?

927
00:57:57.16 --> 00:57:59.16
He was Joe Rogan's daughter.

928
00:57:59.16 --> 00:58:00.16
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

929
00:58:00.16 --> 00:58:00.16
For sure.

930
00:58:00.16 --> 00:58:06.16
Um, well, I don't know him personally, but I'm at, so I'm at, I'm at Tate in 2013 when I did a piece for advice

931
00:58:06.16 --> 00:58:12.16
at the University of Southern California about how they do virtual reality to treat PTSD.

932
00:58:12.16 --> 00:58:14.16
It's on Motherboard if you want to Google it.

933
00:58:14.16 --> 00:58:16.16
You know, I mean, I look pretty cool in it.

934
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:20.16
But anyway, um, so Tate, I was down here and I had to met Tate when I was here.

935
00:58:20.16 --> 00:58:24.16
I did his podcast and then this, you know, so this is going back six or seven years.

936
00:58:24.16 --> 00:58:28.16
And, um, I've never met Rogan, but I mean, eventually I might.

937
00:58:28.16 --> 00:58:30.16
I mean, I know enough people that know him.

938
00:58:30.16 --> 00:58:34.16
But anyway, the point is, I was driving around with Tate and, uh,

939
00:58:34.16 --> 00:58:40.16
we're here in California to do a course at Doose Jim and LA, uh, which Tate introduced me to the owner of.

940
00:58:40.16 --> 00:58:44.16
And this guy is just such a cool dude and he rents such a nice Jim and the atmosphere.

941
00:58:44.16 --> 00:58:46.16
So we're going to take his seminar.

942
00:58:46.16 --> 00:58:51.16
And, and I, and I said, man, I wish I had what you have here in California any, and Tate.

943
00:58:51.16 --> 00:58:54.16
This is a mind-chain or a life-changing moment.

944
00:58:54.16 --> 00:58:56.16
And I had to go through all this to get here.

945
00:58:56.16 --> 00:58:58.16
He said, build it.

946
00:58:58.16 --> 00:59:00.16
And I said, uh, what?

947
00:59:00.16 --> 00:59:03.16
He said, if you want it, build it.

948
00:59:03.16 --> 00:59:05.16
And I said, okay.

949
00:59:05.16 --> 00:59:10.16
And it's taken me since 2013 to get back to here and go through all these other things to realize, like,

950
00:59:10.16 --> 00:59:12.16
uh, I got to build it.

951
00:59:12.16 --> 00:59:16.16
That's why not going into politics again means I can do whatever I want.

952
00:59:16.16 --> 00:59:18.16
Like you said, man, like you're right.

953
00:59:18.16 --> 00:59:19.16
Like it's tough.

954
00:59:19.16 --> 00:59:24.16
Like it's, there's moments of great happiness in politics, but unless that's what you want to do.

955
00:59:24.16 --> 00:59:25.16
Like it's hard.

956
00:59:25.16 --> 00:59:26.16
It's very hard.

957
00:59:26.16 --> 00:59:32.16
And guys, like us, we're self-motivated to do things and waiting around for others to do their thing.

958
00:59:32.16 --> 00:59:36.16
It's just easier to do your own thing, you know?

959
00:59:36.16 --> 00:59:43.16
Especially, you know, like what's, I know he was a German, but in World War II, his orders were find an objective in kill it.

960
00:59:43.16 --> 00:59:46.16
That was his orders at all times.

961
00:59:46.16 --> 00:59:49.16
Like if you don't hear from me, find something and destroy it.

962
00:59:49.16 --> 00:59:53.16
That's basically the mission statement that Kelly and I have put before us.

963
00:59:53.16 --> 00:59:58.16
So I was like, we want to build this place, build a community, and live out of the good life.

964
00:59:58.16 --> 01:00:02.16
And I never want to be the guy I was for the last two years.

965
01:00:02.16 --> 01:00:09.16
And, but I'm, I don't want to say glad, but it's an experience that I've learned a lot from.

966
01:00:09.16 --> 01:00:10.16
Does that make sense?

967
01:00:10.16 --> 01:00:12.16
Yeah, it does make sense.

968
01:00:12.16 --> 01:00:13.16
It does make sense.

969
01:00:13.16 --> 01:00:19.16
It's sort of like the thing I told the Sam Harris when he, when he was telling me that it's hypocritical for me,

970
01:00:19.16 --> 01:00:26.16
because I say war is horrible and awful, but I always say, it's a best experience in my life.

971
01:00:26.16 --> 01:00:28.16
And he says, you're hypocritical for that?

972
01:00:28.16 --> 01:00:32.16
Yeah, and then, well, rightfully so, you can't say something's awesome and then say it's horrible.

973
01:00:32.16 --> 01:00:39.16
And I said, well, it's like this, and I asked him if he had ever known anyone that had had cancer and survived.

974
01:00:39.16 --> 01:00:46.16
And he said, yes, and I said, a lot of those people say, I'm glad it happened because they get this different perspective of life

975
01:00:46.16 --> 01:00:50.16
and different perspective of the world and different value of life and different value of the world.

976
01:00:50.16 --> 01:00:55.16
And so even though you wouldn't wish it on somebody, you're happy that you had to go through it.

977
01:00:55.16 --> 01:00:57.16
And so that sounds like a similar situation.

978
01:00:57.16 --> 01:01:05.16
Well, it's, I always tell people, I had a great time at war, right up to the last step, because it's a horrible thing to do,

979
01:01:05.16 --> 01:01:08.16
but it's what I trained, I volunteered to be there.

980
01:01:08.16 --> 01:01:10.16
You volunteered to be there.

981
01:01:10.16 --> 01:01:14.16
Like, I always say, you know, people, because a lot of people say they're sorry for me losing my feet.

982
01:01:14.16 --> 01:01:19.16
And I say, you know, if I was a Russian draftee and Afghanistan, yeah, be so, feel sorry for me.

983
01:01:19.16 --> 01:01:22.16
But I was exactly where I wanted to be.

984
01:01:22.16 --> 01:01:30.16
And the fact that one of my boys didn't die because I stepped on that, you know, like, if the guy in front of me had stepped on it, I'd be dead.

985
01:01:30.16 --> 01:01:34.16
If the guy in front of him had stepped on it, he'd be dead and I'd be like, we don't know.

986
01:01:34.16 --> 01:01:37.16
I'm glad I'm just a one that stepped on it.

987
01:01:37.16 --> 01:01:40.16
But yeah, like I loved doing my job.

988
01:01:40.16 --> 01:01:42.16
It was a great, it was an amazing job.

989
01:01:42.16 --> 01:01:48.16
You know, and the people that you're around are some of the greatest human beings you're ever going to know on the planet.

990
01:01:48.16 --> 01:02:00.16
So that's what I want to rebuild. I want to rebuild this brotherhood and the sisterhood, this community of, of, of, of, like-minded individuals in the saying surround yourself with people that make you better.

991
01:02:00.16 --> 01:02:03.16
That's not what happens when you're on cocaine.

992
01:02:03.16 --> 01:02:08.16
So, so at some point you went from this mindset of you could see where the future was.

993
01:02:08.16 --> 01:02:12.16
You could see that cocaine is going to ruin your future and you didn't care.

994
01:02:12.16 --> 01:02:17.16
And at some point during this, you said to yourself, okay, I see the future with cocaine.

995
01:02:17.16 --> 01:02:20.16
It's terrible and I'm not going to go there.

996
01:02:20.16 --> 01:02:26.16
Yeah. Well, it was life without Kelly, it was life without the kids, it was life without real friends.

997
01:02:26.16 --> 01:02:33.16
You know, like, even people that love you to death can't be around you because, you know, you're just not.

998
01:02:33.16 --> 01:02:44.16
It's just, it's, it's hard, you know, and I've had a few buddies go down, and on, and it mostly booze, like booze is the most common one because it's really available out there.

999
01:02:44.16 --> 01:02:47.16
So, you know, go down to the store and get it for so many years.

1000
01:02:47.16 --> 01:02:56.16
Yeah. You know, like, listen, I get a lot of flack, but I'm a fan of the, and I know safe injection site is like, people don't agree with, there's no such thing as safe injection. Okay, I get it.

1001
01:02:56.16 --> 01:03:02.16
But the point is, I'm forgiving the option of a place that's safer than a dumpster to shoot up with heroin.

1002
01:03:02.16 --> 01:03:05.16
If it means we might save that life, right?

1003
01:03:05.16 --> 01:03:10.16
And I'm also like, we'd just encounter federally, we'd legalize marijuana.

1004
01:03:10.16 --> 01:03:16.16
If it was up to me, anything people want would be regulated taxed and taxed, right?

1005
01:03:16.16 --> 01:03:31.16
Because if a bottle of jacked anil's hurts, hurts echo if he drinks it or hurt, like, if it hurts us, there's someone who can be held accountable and we can trace that right down to the barrel that it was brewed in or made, I don't know, whiskey is fermented, distilled.

1006
01:03:31.16 --> 01:03:39.16
Distilled, there's the word, and where as if a guy shoots up behind a dumpster and dies, I don't know who to go after and who to, like, who's fault is it?

1007
01:03:39.16 --> 01:03:43.16
It was bad product or a good product, which is usually what gives them an overdose.

1008
01:03:43.16 --> 01:03:54.16
But you know, like, there's just the path to, you know, like, A, A is there because we can get booze at every corner, you know?

1009
01:03:54.16 --> 01:04:00.16
And so we have gambling sites. If you go into a casino, you're actually warned on the door.

1010
01:04:00.16 --> 01:04:04.16
Like a pack of cigarettes says, if you smoke this, it'll be addictive and it could hurt you.

1011
01:04:04.16 --> 01:04:13.16
I just think we need to start talking more about things. And so for me, like, you know, I don't, like, I don't know, man.

1012
01:04:13.16 --> 01:04:21.16
I just, I saw that I wouldn't have the good things in life because of this one thing that had taken over.

1013
01:04:21.16 --> 01:04:33.16
And I, my cousin actually in 2017, in 2017, my cousin who I grew up with, killed himself, not with, and I don't mean killed himself as in, like committed suicide.

1014
01:04:33.16 --> 01:04:40.16
He just drugged himself to death. And he was addicted to, if it was addictive, he was addicted to it.

1015
01:04:40.16 --> 01:04:44.16
And we never, I never figured it out and I had to stop hanging out with them.

1016
01:04:44.16 --> 01:04:47.16
And that was what was happening to me too.

1017
01:04:47.16 --> 01:04:51.16
My, you know, we call it, you know, whether you think it's weird or fufu or whatever you want to call it,

1018
01:04:51.16 --> 01:04:54.16
we do Kellyanne, I do believe or soulmates.

1019
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:58.16
And yes, that's weird and fufu. Yes, but you can do it.

1020
01:04:58.16 --> 01:05:06.16
Yeah, well, thank you, right? And that's the thing. So if you're, if the person who, you think you were put on the planet to be with says,

1021
01:05:06.16 --> 01:05:12.16
I can't be with you the way you are. That's, hey, man, like you got to take a serious look.

1022
01:05:12.16 --> 01:05:19.16
And so it sounds like that really was the critical thought in your head that the person that you cared the most about,

1023
01:05:19.16 --> 01:05:23.16
Yeah, at this moment in time is literally going to walk away.

1024
01:05:23.16 --> 01:05:24.16
She had to.

1025
01:05:24.16 --> 01:05:32.16
And I saw it. I saw it. I was like, I had to go to rehab to give her a break and to give my kids a break.

1026
01:05:32.16 --> 01:05:34.16
When you were having to rehab, did you say to yourself, I'm going there.

1027
01:05:34.16 --> 01:05:37.16
Did you go in there with the attitude of the polished your boots?

1028
01:05:37.16 --> 01:05:38.16
Yeah, no, sorry.

1029
01:05:38.16 --> 01:05:42.16
I didn't finish that. Sorry. I have an ADHD if you can't tell.

1030
01:05:42.16 --> 01:05:47.16
But I went in there, polished boots, pressed uniform.

1031
01:05:47.16 --> 01:05:50.16
I like I had my books. I made my bed.

1032
01:05:50.16 --> 01:05:56.16
It was all the basics. Get back to the basics, right? We even talked about this the first time I was on your show.

1033
01:05:56.16 --> 01:06:02.16
I shaved my head. I started doing some, you know, started working out a little bit, trying to get back into the little bit of shape.

1034
01:06:02.16 --> 01:06:08.16
I started caring about what I ate again. I started taking my vitamins. I started, you know, and I went in there.

1035
01:06:08.16 --> 01:06:12.16
And I know exactly what I'm like when I want to portray that tough guy attitude.

1036
01:06:12.16 --> 01:06:15.16
And that's what I did to keep people away at first.

1037
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:18.16
Because at first, you've ever been arrested?

1038
01:06:18.16 --> 01:06:21.16
Yes. Were you happy about it? No.

1039
01:06:21.16 --> 01:06:22.16
Yeah.

1040
01:06:22.16 --> 01:06:26.16
So I kind of went in like I'd been arrested like I was the first time.

1041
01:06:26.16 --> 01:06:29.16
Not the second time that is in the book, but the first time anyway.

1042
01:06:29.16 --> 01:06:32.16
Like I said, I don't put everything in the book.

1043
01:06:32.16 --> 01:06:36.16
But anyway, you're not very happy and you don't need friends.

1044
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:38.16
So I didn't go in there to make friends.

1045
01:06:38.16 --> 01:06:42.16
So I was a wall for the first week, right?

1046
01:06:42.16 --> 01:06:47.16
But that let me concentrate on exactly what I was there to do if that makes sense.

1047
01:06:47.16 --> 01:06:53.16
And so as that as as as as I was there to get better and do rehab got,

1048
01:06:53.16 --> 01:06:56.16
I don't want to say easier, but I got better at it because it's, you know,

1049
01:06:56.16 --> 01:06:59.16
It's a skill that you are actually taught in rehab is how to be better.

1050
01:06:59.16 --> 01:07:01.16
That's what rehab is.

1051
01:07:01.16 --> 01:07:03.16
Are teaching you how to be better again.

1052
01:07:03.16 --> 01:07:06.16
So what kind of skills are they teaching with?

1053
01:07:06.16 --> 01:07:07.16
Wake up on time.

1054
01:07:07.16 --> 01:07:09.16
I know this sounds we by like, you know, when you're addicted.

1055
01:07:09.16 --> 01:07:10.16
Doesn't sound weird to me.

1056
01:07:10.16 --> 01:07:13.16
I believe I'm just like, it's like based training almost.

1057
01:07:13.16 --> 01:07:14.16
Make it up.

1058
01:07:14.16 --> 01:07:17.16
Make your bed, you know, come to breakfast on time.

1059
01:07:17.16 --> 01:07:22.16
So if you weren't at breakfast, you lost your ability to make a phone call that night.

1060
01:07:22.16 --> 01:07:26.16
And then if you missed any classes during the day, you know, you would have privileges,

1061
01:07:26.16 --> 01:07:30.16
You know, given or taken as as the day or the week went by.

1062
01:07:30.16 --> 01:07:34.16
Now you're you're you're at a place where you pay money to go.

1063
01:07:34.16 --> 01:07:37.16
So you think it'd be how do you take privileges from someone, but they do.

1064
01:07:37.16 --> 01:07:38.16
They do.

1065
01:07:38.16 --> 01:07:39.16
I was like, I'm a grown-ass man.

1066
01:07:39.16 --> 01:07:40.16
If I want to make a phone call, I will.

1067
01:07:40.16 --> 01:07:41.16
They're like, no, you won't.

1068
01:07:41.16 --> 01:07:42.16
I'm like, god damn it, you're right.

1069
01:07:42.16 --> 01:07:44.16
Because I signed that waiver.

1070
01:07:44.16 --> 01:07:49.16
But I, I have tried so hard that I got to like they were bringing me in.

1071
01:07:49.16 --> 01:07:53.16
You know, I'm not, I, anyway, I should probably shouldn't say too much.

1072
01:07:53.16 --> 01:07:59.16
But like, within, you know, I was only there 30 days, but within about, I'd say 15, 20 days.

1073
01:07:59.16 --> 01:08:03.16
I was someone that was turned to by the other clients.

1074
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:06.16
And someone that some of these staff would turn to to like,

1075
01:08:06.16 --> 01:08:10.16
For backup in a certain situation or like I said, I went pop a bear.

1076
01:08:10.16 --> 01:08:14.16
And, but when I first got there, some of the other clients told me like,

1077
01:08:14.16 --> 01:08:17.16
When I first got there, they were like, this guy is a murderer.

1078
01:08:17.16 --> 01:08:18.16
He's going to kill us all.

1079
01:08:18.16 --> 01:08:21.16
Like, because I was just so focused and I had this look, and I, you know,

1080
01:08:21.16 --> 01:08:25.16
I know, you know, we're, we get up in front of troops and try to, you know,

1081
01:08:25.16 --> 01:08:28.16
We got to be the toughest looking guy there, some of them, you know,

1082
01:08:28.16 --> 01:08:30.16
And so I know how to do it.

1083
01:08:30.16 --> 01:08:33.16
But I did that to, for myself more than anything.

1084
01:08:33.16 --> 01:08:36.16
Because I went, okay, I'm back in basic training.

1085
01:08:36.16 --> 01:08:41.16
I have to learn how to be a decent human being and how to look after myself again.

1086
01:08:41.16 --> 01:08:44.16
And man, and they took you through check list.

1087
01:08:44.16 --> 01:08:48.16
A lot of my personality flaws stem from childhood, you know,

1088
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:51.16
And I found that out like what?

1089
01:08:51.16 --> 01:08:53.16
Like stuff I don't want to talk about frankly.

1090
01:08:53.16 --> 01:08:59.16
And, you know, just things that, once you read the literature,

1091
01:08:59.16 --> 01:09:02.16
It's, oh, that is obvious.

1092
01:09:02.16 --> 01:09:05.16
So you can, you can, and this is a conversation that we've been having.

1093
01:09:05.16 --> 01:09:08.16
Sorry, I didn't mean to be so abrupt. I'm not just pouring.

1094
01:09:08.16 --> 01:09:11.16
But I mean is I now understand.

1095
01:09:11.16 --> 01:09:15.16
And that's for me understanding like most guys, like us and girls.

1096
01:09:15.16 --> 01:09:21.16
If I understand the cause, I can, I can deal with the action, right?

1097
01:09:21.16 --> 01:09:24.16
So if you don't understand, then it's just chaos.

1098
01:09:24.16 --> 01:09:27.16
But if there's an explanation as a y, my mind goes there,

1099
01:09:27.16 --> 01:09:29.16
Which then causes me these actions.

1100
01:09:29.16 --> 01:09:33.16
Ah, now I can go back and deal with the cause of that behavior.

1101
01:09:33.16 --> 01:09:35.16
Is that me, is that better way of putting it?

1102
01:09:35.16 --> 01:09:41.16
No, it does make sense. And this is something that I just talked about on another podcast.

1103
01:09:41.16 --> 01:09:49.16
But the first time I kind of recognize that there was these patterns and protocols for psychological issues

1104
01:09:49.16 --> 01:09:54.16
Is honestly when Jordan Peterson came on for the first time.

1105
01:09:54.16 --> 01:09:57.16
And he was, I was explaining how in the warrior kid book,

1106
01:09:57.16 --> 01:10:00.16
How the kid gets over the fear of the water.

1107
01:10:00.16 --> 01:10:02.16
And he goes, oh, yeah, that's a, that's a protocol.

1108
01:10:02.16 --> 01:10:04.16
It's called exposure therapy. And this is what it does.

1109
01:10:04.16 --> 01:10:06.16
Psychological, this is how it works.

1110
01:10:06.16 --> 01:10:10.16
And I just figured that out from just life, right?

1111
01:10:10.16 --> 01:10:15.16
And then I realized that that there's protocols for problems.

1112
01:10:15.16 --> 01:10:17.16
And people have psychological problems.

1113
01:10:17.16 --> 01:10:20.16
There's a, and it's just, and I was using the term brain mechanic.

1114
01:10:20.16 --> 01:10:23.16
But somebody on Twitter said something better, which is mind mechanic.

1115
01:10:23.16 --> 01:10:25.16
So if I would have been told, hey, oh,

1116
01:10:25.16 --> 01:10:28.16
Psychologists in the psychologists, they're called a mind mechanic.

1117
01:10:28.16 --> 01:10:30.16
And they go in there and when there's problems,

1118
01:10:30.16 --> 01:10:32.16
they know how to fix those problems.

1119
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:33.16
I love that.

1120
01:10:33.16 --> 01:10:35.16
Yeah. And what, but when you're, well, like me,

1121
01:10:35.16 --> 01:10:37.16
You're just thinking, oh, that's just a bunch of,

1122
01:10:37.16 --> 01:10:39.16
What'd you say earlier, fool, fool, something?

1123
01:10:39.16 --> 01:10:41.16
It'd be, it'd be, yeah, it's much, it'd be,

1124
01:10:41.16 --> 01:10:43.16
Yeah, it's much, it'd be, yeah, it'd be stuff that you don't really know what's going on.

1125
01:10:43.16 --> 01:10:46.16
But then you talk to, or, or, or in talking to Jordan,

1126
01:10:46.16 --> 01:10:48.16
I heard him say, oh, and this is a problem that you would see.

1127
01:10:48.16 --> 01:10:49.16
And this is how you'd fix that problem.

1128
01:10:49.16 --> 01:10:51.16
Here's another problem over here.

1129
01:10:51.16 --> 01:10:52.16
And here's how you'd fix that problem.

1130
01:10:52.16 --> 01:10:57.16
And the really strange thing is it all lined up with just my natural instincts

1131
01:10:57.16 --> 01:11:01.16
when somebody had this kind of problem, okay, here's what you need to do in that scenario.

1132
01:11:01.16 --> 01:11:05.16
I would just know that from dealing with a bunch of guys over the past,

1133
01:11:05.16 --> 01:11:07.16
you know, 30 years that were having issues, be like, hey, man.

1134
01:11:07.16 --> 01:11:10.16
Oh, you got this problem here's what you need to do.

1135
01:11:10.16 --> 01:11:12.16
Move, do this, do that.

1136
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:13.16
Yeah.

1137
01:11:13.16 --> 01:11:15.16
And, but a psychologist, a mind mechanic, can look at it and go,

1138
01:11:15.16 --> 01:11:17.16
Here's what's going on.

1139
01:11:17.16 --> 01:11:19.16
Here's what this root ties into.

1140
01:11:19.16 --> 01:11:22.16
And here's how you stop this, this cycle of

1141
01:11:22.16 --> 01:11:26.16
negativity and how you move it in a positive direction.

1142
01:11:26.16 --> 01:11:29.16
And that's exactly what rehab is.

1143
01:11:29.16 --> 01:11:37.16
Let's find the, like, you're not a bad person for having these thoughts and actions and reactions.

1144
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:41.16
Because, you know, and that's, and then, oh, here's why.

1145
01:11:41.16 --> 01:11:45.16
Oh, okay, here's where the pattern developed when you were like five or ten,

1146
01:11:45.16 --> 01:11:46.16
or then this happened.

1147
01:11:46.16 --> 01:11:50.16
And your buddy that we were talking about before the show, J Redmond.

1148
01:11:50.16 --> 01:11:55.16
Yeah, honestly, I'd love to talk to him because the sounds like him and I probably had very similar child.

1149
01:11:55.16 --> 01:11:56.16
You get it.

1150
01:11:56.16 --> 01:11:58.16
And then similar careers.

1151
01:11:58.16 --> 01:11:59.16
You guys definitely had similar careers.

1152
01:11:59.16 --> 01:12:04.16
The fact that you got sent back to whatever that, that battle school,

1153
01:12:04.16 --> 01:12:09.16
and J Redmond got sent a Ranger school, you know, and then it's, it's very,

1154
01:12:09.16 --> 01:12:11.16
you guys definitely had some similar.

1155
01:12:11.16 --> 01:12:14.16
I think I was a little more humble than him from the sound of it, but I don't know,

1156
01:12:14.16 --> 01:12:17.16
but I, but I was still out, like, I'm a close friend.

1157
01:12:17.16 --> 01:12:21.16
I almost got, I almost got kicked out of snipers for being arrogant.

1158
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:24.16
It's, it's a close race, and I said, and it was because I didn't say,

1159
01:12:24.16 --> 01:12:28.16
I said, sir, to the Sergeant Major instead of calling him by his first name,

1160
01:12:28.16 --> 01:12:30.16
because he'd like to be called by his first name by the snipers,

1161
01:12:30.16 --> 01:12:32.16
because then it showed he was bros with us.

1162
01:12:32.16 --> 01:12:33.16
Whatever.

1163
01:12:33.16 --> 01:12:34.16
No, I'm not seeing him.

1164
01:12:34.16 --> 01:12:35.16
Am I showing my arrogance maybe right now?

1165
01:12:35.16 --> 01:12:36.16
Yes.

1166
01:12:36.16 --> 01:12:37.16
Yeah.

1167
01:12:37.16 --> 01:12:40.16
No, but it's, it's, but that's the thing is J Redmond, you know,

1168
01:12:40.16 --> 01:12:41.16
he went through all that.

1169
01:12:41.16 --> 01:12:44.16
His book is phenomenal because I'd love to read it.

1170
01:12:44.16 --> 01:12:48.16
It just comes right out and explains all these mistakes that he made.

1171
01:12:48.16 --> 01:12:52.16
And he did a great job redeem himself and turn into a great, great,

1172
01:12:52.16 --> 01:12:53.16
great frog, right?

1173
01:12:53.16 --> 01:12:56.16
And that's what I wanted, and that's my job, my book, I'm flinching.

1174
01:12:56.16 --> 01:12:59.16
It wasn't a, let's make Jody look like a hero.

1175
01:12:59.16 --> 01:13:03.16
It was like, let's be honest and clear about how, you know,

1176
01:13:03.16 --> 01:13:06.16
you start one once placed and end up in another,

1177
01:13:06.16 --> 01:13:09.16
but you have to, you know, you have to realize it,

1178
01:13:09.16 --> 01:13:11.16
mistakes happen.

1179
01:13:11.16 --> 01:13:15.16
And, you know, being 40, you know, by 42 as a kid,

1180
01:13:15.16 --> 01:13:18.16
I thought I'd have it all together.

1181
01:13:18.16 --> 01:13:21.16
But, you know, I'm still learning,

1182
01:13:21.16 --> 01:13:25.16
I'm still, you know, like, I call myself a student, a student of the human condition,

1183
01:13:25.16 --> 01:13:27.16
because I feel like I'm always learning.

1184
01:13:27.16 --> 01:13:29.16
And I will never, you know,

1185
01:13:29.16 --> 01:13:31.16
no one's ever in expert on anything, I don't think.

1186
01:13:31.16 --> 01:13:35.16
And if you click, thank you, I mean, you've stopped learning in my opinion.

1187
01:13:35.16 --> 01:13:36.16
I don't know.

1188
01:13:36.16 --> 01:13:37.16
I know we're going a little off.

1189
01:13:37.16 --> 01:13:39.16
What do the, what do the withdrawal,

1190
01:13:39.16 --> 01:13:41.16
how bad is the withdrawal from?

1191
01:13:41.16 --> 01:13:43.16
Because I know, you know,

1192
01:13:43.16 --> 01:13:45.16
I think the only thing that you,

1193
01:13:45.16 --> 01:13:47.16
not supposed to withdraw on your own is alcohol,

1194
01:13:47.16 --> 01:13:49.16
because you can actually die.

1195
01:13:49.16 --> 01:13:52.16
If you're an alcohol addict and you stop cold turkey,

1196
01:13:52.16 --> 01:13:53.16
you can die.

1197
01:13:53.16 --> 01:13:55.16
If you're deep in, do it, you're going to have,

1198
01:13:55.16 --> 01:13:56.16
I quit,

1199
01:13:56.16 --> 01:13:58.16
oxy cotton cold turkey.

1200
01:13:58.16 --> 01:14:02.16
And when I told my doctor, he said I could have had seizures,

1201
01:14:02.16 --> 01:14:04.16
and stuff and could have died.

1202
01:14:04.16 --> 01:14:07.16
But I wasn't on that high dose then either,

1203
01:14:07.16 --> 01:14:08.16
so it's,

1204
01:14:08.16 --> 01:14:10.16
what about when you quit drinking?

1205
01:14:10.16 --> 01:14:11.16
I didn't.

1206
01:14:11.16 --> 01:14:13.16
Not that big of a deal.

1207
01:14:13.16 --> 01:14:15.16
Yeah, the alcohol, you got to drink a lot a lot.

1208
01:14:15.16 --> 01:14:16.16
Yeah, I like to drink it.

1209
01:14:16.16 --> 01:14:17.16
To be in that situation.

1210
01:14:17.16 --> 01:14:19.16
Yeah, like these guys who were drinking

1211
01:14:19.16 --> 01:14:23.16
the whole bottle of vodka every day.

1212
01:14:23.16 --> 01:14:24.16
Okay, I don't like that.

1213
01:14:24.16 --> 01:14:27.16
They gave us the movie leaving Las Vegas with Nick Cage.

1214
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:28.16
No.

1215
01:14:28.16 --> 01:14:30.16
That guy, like he would go grocery shopping,

1216
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:33.16
and his every day and his cart was full of booze.

1217
01:14:33.16 --> 01:14:36.16
Which is actually more common than I thought.

1218
01:14:36.16 --> 01:14:37.16
Like it's crazy.

1219
01:14:37.16 --> 01:14:40.16
Someone that gets it after with the, with the vodka.

1220
01:14:40.16 --> 01:14:42.16
And the vodka for some reason,

1221
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:43.16
because they think you can't smell it.

1222
01:14:43.16 --> 01:14:44.16
Yeah.

1223
01:14:44.16 --> 01:14:46.16
But I mean, if you drink enough, you can smell it.

1224
01:14:46.16 --> 01:14:47.16
Yeah.

1225
01:14:47.16 --> 01:14:51.16
But, but the withdrawals were,

1226
01:14:51.16 --> 01:14:53.16
is it mostly psychological?

1227
01:14:53.16 --> 01:14:55.16
Yeah, it's not because it's psychological.

1228
01:14:55.16 --> 01:14:58.16
There's some physical at first.

1229
01:14:58.16 --> 01:15:03.16
I went through a period where my body was like detoxing.

1230
01:15:03.16 --> 01:15:05.16
So like I was getting these weird zits on,

1231
01:15:05.16 --> 01:15:08.16
in like weird places and stuff like that.

1232
01:15:08.16 --> 01:15:09.16
And, um,

1233
01:15:09.16 --> 01:15:11.16
is this from the cocaine?

1234
01:15:11.16 --> 01:15:15.16
Yeah, it's from the impurities that they get mixed with.

1235
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:17.16
But then, as far as detox,

1236
01:15:17.16 --> 01:15:19.16
you're talking about detoxing from cocaine.

1237
01:15:19.16 --> 01:15:20.16
Yeah.

1238
01:15:20.16 --> 01:15:21.16
Yeah.

1239
01:15:21.16 --> 01:15:21.16
Yeah.

1240
01:15:21.16 --> 01:15:22.16
Sorry.

1241
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:23.16
Yeah.

1242
01:15:23.16 --> 01:15:25.16
But I mean, it's more just like letting your brain

1243
01:15:25.16 --> 01:15:27.16
relive, relive itself.

1244
01:15:27.16 --> 01:15:28.16
So I went in there.

1245
01:15:28.16 --> 01:15:29.16
I stopped taking any Tylenol.

1246
01:15:29.16 --> 01:15:30.16
Like I don't take.

1247
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:32.16
I'm trying to,

1248
01:15:32.16 --> 01:15:34.16
and I killing and I are working on this.

1249
01:15:34.16 --> 01:15:35.16
We're trying to, like,

1250
01:15:35.16 --> 01:15:37.16
we're almost sugars almost gone.

1251
01:15:37.16 --> 01:15:40.16
I don't take any pills.

1252
01:15:40.16 --> 01:15:42.16
I keep going away from the mic.

1253
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:45.16
Um, where were we babe?

1254
01:15:45.16 --> 01:15:47.16
We were in West Virginia doing some training at,

1255
01:15:47.16 --> 01:15:48.16
or not training.

1256
01:15:48.16 --> 01:15:50.16
We were doing some familiarization

1257
01:15:50.16 --> 01:15:51.16
at a place, uh,

1258
01:15:51.16 --> 01:15:53.16
built for three letter agencies.

1259
01:15:53.16 --> 01:15:55.16
And, um,

1260
01:15:55.16 --> 01:15:58.16
my leg was just on fire because of the day we'd had.

1261
01:15:58.16 --> 01:16:00.16
And she gave me two Tylenol and two Alive.

1262
01:16:00.16 --> 01:16:02.16
And I passed out, like,

1263
01:16:02.16 --> 01:16:03.16
like that.

1264
01:16:03.16 --> 01:16:06.16
I didn't, I know that was in the morning.

1265
01:16:06.16 --> 01:16:07.16
Yeah.

1266
01:16:07.16 --> 01:16:08.16
Sorry.

1267
01:16:08.16 --> 01:16:09.16
I felt back to sleep because I woke up with the pain.

1268
01:16:09.16 --> 01:16:10.16
Anyway,

1269
01:16:10.16 --> 01:16:12.16
that's what I want.

1270
01:16:12.16 --> 01:16:14.16
I remember the first time I took a Tylenol

1271
01:16:14.16 --> 01:16:16.16
and I was in, after I joined the army.

1272
01:16:16.16 --> 01:16:19.16
And we're on exercise, maybe a year later.

1273
01:16:19.16 --> 01:16:20.16
And I was in the woods.

1274
01:16:20.16 --> 01:16:21.16
My back was a little sore.

1275
01:16:21.16 --> 01:16:23.16
So the medic gave me two extra strength Tylenol.

1276
01:16:23.16 --> 01:16:25.16
I just never had Tylenol before.

1277
01:16:25.16 --> 01:16:27.16
Because I just, you know, I was 17, 18.

1278
01:16:27.16 --> 01:16:28.16
And I took it.

1279
01:16:28.16 --> 01:16:31.16
And my body felt like it was on unicorns and sunshine.

1280
01:16:31.16 --> 01:16:33.16
For, like, three days.

1281
01:16:33.16 --> 01:16:36.16
And that was from two extra strength Tylenol.

1282
01:16:36.16 --> 01:16:38.16
When you're doing blow and, and drinking a lot,

1283
01:16:38.16 --> 01:16:41.16
like, you're, you're that breakfast, you know, to get over it.

1284
01:16:41.16 --> 01:16:46.16
And, and I like that if I take one Tylenol now, my body is okay.

1285
01:16:46.16 --> 01:16:47.16
You know, because I'm a big guy.

1286
01:16:47.16 --> 01:16:49.16
So I need, you know, I usually go extra strength.

1287
01:16:49.16 --> 01:16:51.16
I want to take, I want to be able to take regular strength.

1288
01:16:51.16 --> 01:16:52.16
Remember that?

1289
01:16:52.16 --> 01:16:54.16
Everybody took regular strength anything.

1290
01:16:54.16 --> 01:16:56.16
You know, I have a coffee.

1291
01:16:56.16 --> 01:16:57.16
And I feel it.

1292
01:16:57.16 --> 01:17:00.16
It's not just like, a whatever anymore.

1293
01:17:00.16 --> 01:17:02.16
So that's kind of what I'm on.

1294
01:17:02.16 --> 01:17:03.16
A bit of a mission.

1295
01:17:03.16 --> 01:17:09.16
It get back to really basic food and, and, and liquid intake, you know,

1296
01:17:09.16 --> 01:17:12.16
like the cold brew that I was drinking when we got here, like, there's nothing else in it.

1297
01:17:12.16 --> 01:17:13.16
It's just coffee.

1298
01:17:13.16 --> 01:17:15.16
You know, that had the nitrous gin in it, right?

1299
01:17:15.16 --> 01:17:19.16
But there's no sugar and no, you know, I'll put a little cream in my coffee now.

1300
01:17:19.16 --> 01:17:21.16
And, instead of extra lyrids, right?

1301
01:17:21.16 --> 01:17:23.16
We're trying to, I'm buying mediums and smalls.

1302
01:17:23.16 --> 01:17:28.16
So we're trying to just get, get back down to a baseline of, of, of minimum.

1303
01:17:28.16 --> 01:17:31.16
And it's, it's working okay.

1304
01:17:31.16 --> 01:17:37.16
But, you know, it's a daily, I talked to my Averyab guy, at least once a week, still.

1305
01:17:37.16 --> 01:17:41.16
You know, I said in pictures of our travels and stuff, you know, we got the dog.

1306
01:17:41.16 --> 01:17:42.16
I got the service dog now.

1307
01:17:42.16 --> 01:17:45.16
It's just like, you know, they're so busy.

1308
01:17:45.16 --> 01:17:48.16
Like, she's such a, she's a German shepherd malnlaw mix.

1309
01:17:48.16 --> 01:17:53.16
There's such busy dogs that like, you just, you don't have time to, to be hung over or anything.

1310
01:17:53.16 --> 01:17:57.16
So, and, and, like, you quit drinking on your own anyway, right?

1311
01:17:57.16 --> 01:17:59.16
Like, you're, like, long time ago?

1312
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:04.16
Well, yeah. So what happened with me is I just retired from the Navy and, and while, while I was in the Navy,

1313
01:18:04.16 --> 01:18:06.16
was pretty normal to just drink.

1314
01:18:06.16 --> 01:18:07.16
Yeah, we've talked to them.

1315
01:18:07.16 --> 01:18:08.16
Yeah.

1316
01:18:08.16 --> 01:18:13.16
So, but when I retired, I just looked up a month later and I hadn't had anything to drink.

1317
01:18:13.16 --> 01:18:15.16
Then I looked up three months later and I hadn't had anything to drink.

1318
01:18:15.16 --> 01:18:19.16
Then I looked up six months later and I was like, well, I have no desire.

1319
01:18:19.16 --> 01:18:24.16
And I, and I must say, you know, you talked about not having an addictive personality.

1320
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:27.16
And I think I truly do not have an addictive personality.

1321
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:31.16
I think that other than maybe like something like Jiu Jitsu or something like that,

1322
01:18:31.16 --> 01:18:36.16
which I definitely got pretty fanatic about and I still have a hard time with withdrawals.

1323
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:40.16
If I don't get to train for a certain amount of time.

1324
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:42.16
What did Dean say here?

1325
01:18:42.16 --> 01:18:43.16
Oh, yeah.

1326
01:18:43.16 --> 01:18:47.16
Dean Lister at one time said I was addicted to power.

1327
01:18:47.16 --> 01:18:49.16
Which was a domination.

1328
01:18:49.16 --> 01:18:52.16
Yeah, you know, I was, I am juggle.

1329
01:18:52.16 --> 01:18:55.16
I was given him a hard time about not training and, um,

1330
01:18:55.16 --> 01:18:59.16
hassling him and telling me, you know, you're, you're just addicted to that.

1331
01:18:59.16 --> 01:19:01.16
No, and he said you're an addict too.

1332
01:19:01.16 --> 01:19:03.16
And I said, what am I addicted to?

1333
01:19:03.16 --> 01:19:07.16
And he says, you're addicted to power.

1334
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:13.16
But hey, if you can do it on the, on the mats better than becoming like a dictator.

1335
01:19:13.16 --> 01:19:23.16
Yeah, but the point is for me is when I, I never even, like, I would say maybe in my mid 20s,

1336
01:19:23.16 --> 01:19:28.16
I would get fired up like, hey, like we might put tune.

1337
01:19:28.16 --> 01:19:30.16
It would be the end, it would be a Friday.

1338
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:32.16
And we just got done with some hard training.

1339
01:19:32.16 --> 01:19:35.16
We were in some random city and it'd be like, oh, yeah, we're going to go on.

1340
01:19:35.16 --> 01:19:36.16
Have a good time tonight.

1341
01:19:36.16 --> 01:19:39.16
It was more about like, hey, I know we're not going to have a good time about tonight.

1342
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:41.16
That it was like, I really need a beer.

1343
01:19:41.16 --> 01:19:42.16
Yeah, me too.

1344
01:19:42.16 --> 01:19:45.16
And so as I did that, that was just kind of normal.

1345
01:19:45.16 --> 01:19:49.16
And there was definitely the problem with that attitude is,

1346
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:51.16
there are people that have addictive personalities.

1347
01:19:51.16 --> 01:19:55.16
And alcohol is ruined all kinds of guys in the civil teams and all kinds of guys in the military,

1348
01:19:55.16 --> 01:20:00.16
because it's really, it's just a slippery slope to go from, oh, and it,

1349
01:20:00.16 --> 01:20:04.16
this is just normal to, hey, it's Tuesday night.

1350
01:20:04.16 --> 01:20:05.16
I'm at home.

1351
01:20:05.16 --> 01:20:06.16
I'm alone.

1352
01:20:06.16 --> 01:20:08.16
And I'm going to drink a 12 pack.

1353
01:20:08.16 --> 01:20:12.16
That's a pretty slippery slope that people, people get.

1354
01:20:12.16 --> 01:20:14.16
They're actually just having Jason Gardner on.

1355
01:20:14.16 --> 01:20:19.16
And he, he was, he, he quit drinking just like, maybe, I don't know, a couple months ago.

1356
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:21.16
But you know, I said, well, how much were you drinking?

1357
01:20:21.16 --> 01:20:26.16
He goes, you know, and I'd come home and I'd crack one open and then I'd crack one open before dinner,

1358
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:28.16
and then I'd have one during dinner, and then I'd have one after dinner,

1359
01:20:28.16 --> 01:20:31.16
and then maybe I'd have one before I go to bed with their six beers.

1360
01:20:31.16 --> 01:20:33.16
And he's not a big guy.

1361
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:37.16
So six beers is like, you know, he's, and he's even said, like, oh,

1362
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:42.16
I would feel it, you know, not feel it like, you know, he's still doing everything he has to.

1363
01:20:42.16 --> 01:20:45.16
But he's not doing it optimally.

1364
01:20:45.16 --> 01:20:48.16
And now he said he, he's like, I feel just amazing.

1365
01:20:48.16 --> 01:20:50.16
And that's pretty much how Jason talks.

1366
01:20:50.16 --> 01:20:52.16
So he says, I feel amazing now.

1367
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:58.16
So, but he's one of those guys that, you know, you could go down that slippery slope.

1368
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:01.16
And he wasn't far down it, but he would look up every night in cold.

1369
01:21:01.16 --> 01:21:02.16
You know, because we're new acre, let's face it.

1370
01:21:02.16 --> 01:21:03.16
You have six beers.

1371
01:21:03.16 --> 01:21:05.16
You don't feel as good as if you had no beers.

1372
01:21:05.16 --> 01:21:06.16
And that's something you talked about, Echo.

1373
01:21:06.16 --> 01:21:09.16
Yeah, I remember that you were talking to a drink into a quadcar.

1374
01:21:09.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1375
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1377
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1378
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1379
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1380
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1381
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1382
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1383
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:10.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1384
01:21:10.16 --> 01:21:22.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1385
01:21:22.16 --> 01:21:23.16
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1386
01:21:23.16 --> 01:21:25.16
And that's the thing.

1387
01:21:25.16 --> 01:21:23.16
Like, you wake up and you feel foggy, and like, you know, like, 3 days are wasted if you'd do too much.

1388
01:21:23.16 --> 01:21:27.16
And I've anything, you know, like you could, who knows but to put, you know,

1389
01:21:27.16 --> 01:21:31.16
I knew guys I woke up and drank whiskey with breakfast.

1390
01:21:31.16 --> 01:21:35.16
But it was so accepted in our world as well.

1391
01:21:35.16 --> 01:21:38.16
Yeah, that it was, you know, if you showed up for PT and you were hungover.

1392
01:21:38.16 --> 01:21:39.16
It was a joke.

1393
01:21:39.16 --> 01:21:39.16
Right now.

1394
01:21:39.16 --> 01:21:40.76
Yeah, oh, what's up, Jony?

1395
01:21:40.76 --> 01:21:43.40
If you didn't like that, it was a bad javonor.

1396
01:21:43.40 --> 01:21:44.24
Yeah, it was bad javonor.

1397
01:21:44.24 --> 01:21:45.56
Oh, yeah, this guy's drunk.

1398
01:21:45.56 --> 01:21:47.44
Wow, look at how well this guy can run, even though he's

1399
01:21:47.44 --> 01:21:47.88
hammered.

1400
01:21:47.88 --> 01:21:50.56
Look at mid-a-grunning, even though he's throwing up on the move.

1401
01:21:50.56 --> 01:21:51.84
That's soldier right there.

1402
01:21:51.84 --> 01:21:54.84
Yeah, there's an old seal master chief at Seal Team 1

1403
01:21:54.84 --> 01:21:56.68
before I got there, an old Vietnam guy.

1404
01:21:56.68 --> 01:21:58.48
And when you went in and talked to him, he had poor shots

1405
01:21:58.48 --> 01:21:59.000
of Dikeela.

1406
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.16
That's how it was going to be.

1407
01:22:00.16 --> 01:22:02.000
Like, oh, it's nine o'clock in the morning cool.

1408
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:02.96
You want to talk to me?

1409
01:22:02.96 --> 01:22:04.44
Roger that's what you're doing shots.

1410
01:22:04.44 --> 01:22:05.16
Yeah, it's cool.

1411
01:22:05.16 --> 01:22:08.44
And that's, again, there's people that can handle that.

1412
01:22:08.44 --> 01:22:11.56
And there's people that can't and broadly speaking,

1413
01:22:11.56 --> 01:22:12.80
let's face it.

1414
01:22:12.80 --> 01:22:14.32
And this is what I eventually thought to myself,

1415
01:22:14.32 --> 01:22:18.56
broadly speaking, it makes no sense whatsoever to me now.

1416
01:22:18.56 --> 01:22:20.68
As I look back, I'm like, this makes no sense to me.

1417
01:22:20.68 --> 01:22:22.68
This does absolutely nothing positive for me.

1418
01:22:22.68 --> 01:22:24.92
Doesn't make me stronger, doesn't make me smarter.

1419
01:22:24.92 --> 01:22:26.52
In fact, it does the opposite.

1420
01:22:26.52 --> 01:22:29.28
Makes you weaker and makes you dumber.

1421
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:32.16
But it took me a long time to figure that out.

1422
01:22:32.16 --> 01:22:34.32
And the weird thing for me is when I was a kid growing up,

1423
01:22:34.32 --> 01:22:37.72
I was into hardcore music and like the straight edge scene

1424
01:22:37.72 --> 01:22:38.56
of people on the other side.

1425
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:42.88
I didn't actually have that, but I definitely listened

1426
01:22:42.88 --> 01:22:43.88
to that music.

1427
01:22:43.88 --> 01:22:47.16
And it had an influence on me without a doubt,

1428
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:53.28
had an influence on me because it was a rebellion

1429
01:22:53.28 --> 01:22:56.32
and a counter to the kids that I knew that were getting drunk

1430
01:22:56.32 --> 01:22:58.24
and acting stupid, smoking pot.

1431
01:22:58.24 --> 01:23:00.56
And I'm over here going literally thinking,

1432
01:23:00.56 --> 01:23:01.80
you're weak and I'm strong.

1433
01:23:01.80 --> 01:23:03.12
That's an air-initiative way.

1434
01:23:03.12 --> 01:23:07.40
But that's as a 14, 15, 16-year-old kid.

1435
01:23:07.40 --> 01:23:09.88
When you're looking at someone else that's smoking pot

1436
01:23:09.88 --> 01:23:11.40
and getting drunk and you're thinking,

1437
01:23:11.40 --> 01:23:12.68
they're weak and I'm strong.

1438
01:23:12.68 --> 01:23:15.48
That's kind of a positive thing as far as I'm concerned.

1439
01:23:15.48 --> 01:23:17.88
And I remember getting called weak when I didn't drink

1440
01:23:17.88 --> 01:23:18.48
in the pool.

1441
01:23:18.48 --> 01:23:19.48
Oh, 100% out.

1442
01:23:19.48 --> 01:23:21.52
But I grew up both sides of the family

1443
01:23:21.52 --> 01:23:24.16
have their fair share of alcoholics.

1444
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:26.48
Even as a kid, I was someone who,

1445
01:23:26.48 --> 01:23:28.52
even though I'm Canadian, Nancy Reagan,

1446
01:23:28.52 --> 01:23:30.76
say no to drugs, worked.

1447
01:23:30.76 --> 01:23:32.92
Like I said, I smoked hash a handful of times

1448
01:23:32.92 --> 01:23:35.16
because my buddy's mom was hot and she sold it.

1449
01:23:35.16 --> 01:23:40.16
And I didn't touch anything except booze.

1450
01:23:40.16 --> 01:23:42.76
And even then it was like, I was like, you guys,

1451
01:23:42.76 --> 01:23:45.36
I could go three months and not drink.

1452
01:23:45.36 --> 01:23:47.60
And just be like, I have enough drink for like three months.

1453
01:23:47.60 --> 01:23:50.12
I quit cigarettes when we were on deployment

1454
01:23:50.12 --> 01:23:52.68
because I couldn't run up the hill next to our camp.

1455
01:23:52.68 --> 01:23:54.28
I was like, fuck, if I can't run up the hill,

1456
01:23:54.28 --> 01:23:55.80
obviously these things are no.

1457
01:23:55.80 --> 01:23:57.12
It was just something I picked up as a kid

1458
01:23:57.12 --> 01:23:59.28
because I watched lethal weapon too much.

1459
01:23:59.28 --> 01:24:02.36
Mel Gibson, oh, and then Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis,

1460
01:24:02.36 --> 01:24:04.16
Mel Gibson, all they did was smoke and everything.

1461
01:24:04.16 --> 01:24:06.32
Do people still smoke in movies right now, Echo Charles?

1462
01:24:06.32 --> 01:24:08.16
A cowway lesson, we're less late.

1463
01:24:08.16 --> 01:24:12.52
I was watching that movie Constantine with Cano Reeves last night.

1464
01:24:12.52 --> 01:24:13.64
I just wanted my favorite movies.

1465
01:24:13.64 --> 01:24:14.48
I don't know why.

1466
01:24:14.48 --> 01:24:15.48
The demons and the other.

1467
01:24:15.48 --> 01:24:16.08
Yeah, I don't know why.

1468
01:24:16.08 --> 01:24:17.000
I just liked that one.

1469
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.68
But he smokes a lot.

1470
01:24:18.68 --> 01:24:19.64
But that's the character.

1471
01:24:19.64 --> 01:24:21.000
He dies a lung cancer in that.

1472
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.84
Right.

1473
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:23.44
Like that's part of the actual lung cancer.

1474
01:24:23.44 --> 01:24:24.92
Yeah, he actually has it.

1475
01:24:24.92 --> 01:24:27.12
Yeah, he actually has lung cancer in the movie.

1476
01:24:27.12 --> 01:24:29.68
But anyway, yeah, I just,

1477
01:24:29.68 --> 01:24:32.56
but I, and the guy I've told me about this

1478
01:24:32.56 --> 01:24:36.08
anti-addictive personality, like in my 20s.

1479
01:24:36.08 --> 01:24:37.60
So I kind of skated on that.

1480
01:24:37.60 --> 01:24:40.36
Yeah, yeah, you felt like that was more reinforcement

1481
01:24:40.36 --> 01:24:41.32
for your personality.

1482
01:24:41.32 --> 01:24:44.52
I just, but also like I quit smoking and drinking

1483
01:24:44.52 --> 01:24:47.12
honestly dude, like I said it was a problem

1484
01:24:47.12 --> 01:24:50.04
because at the time it was, but it was because I was doing

1485
01:24:50.04 --> 01:24:52.72
all the coke because then it levels you.

1486
01:24:52.72 --> 01:24:54.52
And I quit drinking New Year's Eve at Kel.

1487
01:24:54.52 --> 01:24:56.28
Like she was like, I don't want to drink anymore of it.

1488
01:24:56.28 --> 01:24:57.32
It helps you not do coke.

1489
01:24:57.32 --> 01:24:58.60
And I was like, all right, awesome.

1490
01:24:58.60 --> 01:25:02.76
So we quit drinking, but that the cocaine just would

1491
01:25:02.76 --> 01:25:03.84
let go.

1492
01:25:03.84 --> 01:25:06.28
And again, I'd go through like a week where I wouldn't do it

1493
01:25:06.28 --> 01:25:07.48
and then I'd a week where I did it.

1494
01:25:07.48 --> 01:25:09.96
And you know, but eventually, like you said,

1495
01:25:09.96 --> 01:25:12.92
your buddy didn't hit like his bottom wasn't like your bottom?

1496
01:25:12.92 --> 01:25:16.32
You know what, I was thinking about your bottom

1497
01:25:16.32 --> 01:25:18.44
is whatever you wanted to be.

1498
01:25:18.44 --> 01:25:23.44
And so I saw the bottom coming for the whole time,

1499
01:25:25.16 --> 01:25:26.000
pretty much.

1500
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.56
2017, I didn't for a lot of it, but near the end,

1501
01:25:30.56 --> 01:25:33.20
it was clear that there was a problem.

1502
01:25:33.20 --> 01:25:34.84
Like I still didn't really see the problem

1503
01:25:34.84 --> 01:25:36.28
until I was doing those interviews

1504
01:25:36.28 --> 01:25:37.52
and then rape-free saw you.

1505
01:25:37.52 --> 01:25:41.000
But then 2018 it was trying to level out and figure out

1506
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.60
which way it was up which way it was down again, you know.

1507
01:25:43.60 --> 01:25:47.80
And you know, don't be afraid to call in reinforcements

1508
01:25:47.80 --> 01:25:49.04
like we talked about last time.

1509
01:25:49.04 --> 01:25:53.44
Like no, no one is a rock, no one's an island, right?

1510
01:25:53.44 --> 01:25:56.52
Like you don't, like Rambo did isn't real, right?

1511
01:25:56.52 --> 01:26:00.64
As cool as a movie character he is, he has air support.

1512
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:02.64
He has, you know, he has a fire team,

1513
01:26:02.64 --> 01:26:04.92
he has a machine gun team on the flank.

1514
01:26:04.92 --> 01:26:07.36
He's got, you know, all he's got are indirect,

1515
01:26:07.36 --> 01:26:12.000
stand by like no one is a one man army and, you know,

1516
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.84
and I talked about this last time

1517
01:26:13.84 --> 01:26:15.04
and I talked about it the first time

1518
01:26:15.04 --> 01:26:17.08
I was on the show and I keep re-learning these things

1519
01:26:17.08 --> 01:26:18.64
but in different contexts.

1520
01:26:19.72 --> 01:26:22.92
And you know, I'm, I hope I'm done learning.

1521
01:26:22.92 --> 01:26:25.48
These, these lessons, you know.

1522
01:26:25.48 --> 01:26:29.52
And I want to get back to just live in positive, clean.

1523
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.60
You know, I, I'm repeating myself now but dude, like,

1524
01:26:34.60 --> 01:26:37.52
it was rough and I honestly I questioned whether or not,

1525
01:26:37.52 --> 01:26:39.68
like, you know, like people like you

1526
01:26:39.68 --> 01:26:42.52
or people in Canada, there's some of my friends,

1527
01:26:42.52 --> 01:26:46.40
like, are they gonna accept when I'm this honest?

1528
01:26:46.40 --> 01:26:49.88
But I was prepared for the consequences too

1529
01:26:49.88 --> 01:26:54.16
because that's, I felt like what I deserved with my actions.

1530
01:26:54.16 --> 01:26:55.16
Does that make sense?

1531
01:26:55.16 --> 01:26:56.000
Okay.

1532
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.72
And, and for the most part, like I said,

1533
01:26:58.72 --> 01:27:00.36
everyone's been understanding like,

1534
01:27:02.28 --> 01:27:04.72
and it makes it easier for me to talk about,

1535
01:27:04.72 --> 01:27:07.64
you know, one of the reasons I, I've, I've talked about

1536
01:27:07.64 --> 01:27:11.28
with my psychologist why I didn't get PTSD

1537
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:14.32
from my injuries is because I talked about it so much.

1538
01:27:14.32 --> 01:27:17.52
So I'm hoping that talking about this openly

1539
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:21.12
and if, if more listeners to the show and, you know,

1540
01:27:21.12 --> 01:27:26.12
if you go to my show, the Jody Medic Podcast episode 39,

1541
01:27:26.52 --> 01:27:29.04
I believe is full disclosure where I tried to,

1542
01:27:29.04 --> 01:27:32.20
I tried to lay it all out even more than we have here.

1543
01:27:33.60 --> 01:27:36.76
And it feels better every time I tell the story, you know.

1544
01:27:36.76 --> 01:27:39.40
And it's a lot to get into like an hour or two.

1545
01:27:39.40 --> 01:27:41.80
It is really but, you know, with us,

1546
01:27:41.80 --> 01:27:43.72
it's almost like an evolution.

1547
01:27:43.72 --> 01:27:46.16
All right, the first show, we did good,

1548
01:27:46.16 --> 01:27:47.76
but, you know, even back then, like,

1549
01:27:47.76 --> 01:27:50.80
if things were, things were getting to be a little dicey

1550
01:27:50.80 --> 01:27:53.76
with the politics and with the home life and stuff.

1551
01:27:53.76 --> 01:27:58.12
But, and, man, I, I just, and, you know,

1552
01:27:58.12 --> 01:28:01.000
I did go through a period where losing my legs

1553
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.20
became a real problem there and Kelly's nodding your head

1554
01:28:04.20 --> 01:28:06.08
because she saw it, you know, like,

1555
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:08.72
when I couldn't wear my legs, I couldn't drive my car.

1556
01:28:08.72 --> 01:28:12.000
I know I drove here last time, but I had with the hand controls.

1557
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.72
When I first took the legs off that, I didn't have that.

1558
01:28:14.72 --> 01:28:19.72
I was in an apartment by myself, you know, anyway,

1559
01:28:19.72 --> 01:28:22.56
I just, you know, here I am.

1560
01:28:22.56 --> 01:28:27.56
Do you, do you, you know, the dogs coming up

1561
01:28:27.56 --> 01:28:29.36
because you can feel it getting a little worked up right now?

1562
01:28:29.36 --> 01:28:34.36
How hard day to day, are you thinking to yourself?

1563
01:28:35.96 --> 01:28:38.52
Like, what's the temptation level daily

1564
01:28:38.52 --> 01:28:41.88
where you have your friend that delivers?

1565
01:28:41.88 --> 01:28:42.72
Right now?

1566
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:43.56
Yeah.

1567
01:28:43.56 --> 01:28:48.56
So, how hard is it on, like, a day to day basis?

1568
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:52.36
What's the temptation?

1569
01:28:52.36 --> 01:28:55.20
Like, at first it was massive.

1570
01:28:55.20 --> 01:28:58.20
Like, I would, you know, let's show narcos.

1571
01:28:59.40 --> 01:29:00.16
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1572
01:29:00.16 --> 01:29:02.56
I have it, you know, you know, the show narcos.

1573
01:29:02.56 --> 01:29:03.96
It's about Pablo Escobar.

1574
01:29:03.96 --> 01:29:04.80
Okay.

1575
01:29:04.80 --> 01:29:06.32
So, they just came out with season two,

1576
01:29:06.32 --> 01:29:08.28
which is now the Mexican courteles.

1577
01:29:08.28 --> 01:29:10.44
I haven't watched a single episode.

1578
01:29:10.44 --> 01:29:15.44
We were watching pulp fiction and I had to turn it off

1579
01:29:15.44 --> 01:29:20.08
when the, what's her name, did a line of coke.

1580
01:29:20.08 --> 01:29:21.92
Before in John Chivalde, it was picking her up.

1581
01:29:21.92 --> 01:29:24.12
Like, that is like, I could,

1582
01:29:24.12 --> 01:29:28.44
I, even now I avoid anything that has drugs in it

1583
01:29:28.44 --> 01:29:29.48
for the most part.

1584
01:29:31.56 --> 01:29:34.36
And at first it was, and even when I was using,

1585
01:29:34.36 --> 01:29:36.28
like, if I was on a roll where I was like two

1586
01:29:36.28 --> 01:29:38.48
or three or four days where I hadn't used,

1587
01:29:38.48 --> 01:29:40.80
if I put on a show like Scarface, I was like,

1588
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:43.12
oh, you can't watch Scarface sober.

1589
01:29:43.12 --> 01:29:45.84
You know, delivering a ball or, you know,

1590
01:29:45.84 --> 01:29:47.72
in a case of whiskey.

1591
01:29:47.72 --> 01:29:51.56
But, you know, as time has gone by and Kelly and I

1592
01:29:51.56 --> 01:29:53.24
are finding more positive things.

1593
01:29:53.24 --> 01:29:55.08
Like, HQ is happening.

1594
01:29:55.08 --> 01:29:57.76
Like, like, we call it HQ because it's headquarters

1595
01:29:57.76 --> 01:30:00.68
for everything that we're gonna do for the future.

1596
01:30:00.68 --> 01:30:03.56
And we just started to, you know,

1597
01:30:03.56 --> 01:30:05.08
we're trying to start our home business

1598
01:30:05.08 --> 01:30:06.52
called Fire Team Alpha.

1599
01:30:06.52 --> 01:30:08.80
We're Fire Team Alpha.

1600
01:30:08.80 --> 01:30:11.20
I don't know how you guys designate in the seals,

1601
01:30:11.20 --> 01:30:13.92
but for us in a section, you have Fire Team Alpha

1602
01:30:13.92 --> 01:30:15.80
Bravo Charlie Delta.

1603
01:30:15.80 --> 01:30:18.64
So we're Fire Team Alpha within the section.

1604
01:30:18.64 --> 01:30:22.36
And we want to help other couples and individuals, right?

1605
01:30:22.36 --> 01:30:26.88
And our life coaching is gonna involve some tactical flavor,

1606
01:30:26.88 --> 01:30:28.92
you know, so shooting if you want, things like that.

1607
01:30:28.92 --> 01:30:33.32
But, so, you know, like, we're doing it.

1608
01:30:33.32 --> 01:30:36.12
And the closer we do it, the more steps we take,

1609
01:30:36.12 --> 01:30:39.68
the, like, it's, you know, we were last night,

1610
01:30:39.68 --> 01:30:42.12
we were driving here from LA and we were like,

1611
01:30:42.12 --> 01:30:45.40
we were both just kind of like, remember like,

1612
01:30:45.40 --> 01:30:49.08
three months ago, it feels like forever ago, you know?

1613
01:30:49.08 --> 01:30:51.68
Like, remember we used to be addicted to cocaine.

1614
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:54.04
And she's like, what do you mean used to be, right?

1615
01:30:54.04 --> 01:30:56.44
Like, it's a bit of a reminder, but for me,

1616
01:30:56.44 --> 01:30:58.52
I don't even know that guy anymore.

1617
01:30:58.52 --> 01:31:01.84
But that was just me back in December.

1618
01:31:01.84 --> 01:31:02.80
And I like that.

1619
01:31:02.80 --> 01:31:07.80
I was in rehab with people that have, this is their fifth time.

1620
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.92
And that scared the shit out of me.

1621
01:31:09.92 --> 01:31:12.84
I was like, what do you mean your fifth time?

1622
01:31:12.84 --> 01:31:14.16
And then this other guy, you know,

1623
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:15.84
and they're all in their 20s.

1624
01:31:15.84 --> 01:31:18.16
And they've been to rehab three, four, five, six times.

1625
01:31:18.16 --> 01:31:20.92
I'm like damn, I need to figure out a way

1626
01:31:20.92 --> 01:31:23.12
to A and ever B here again.

1627
01:31:23.12 --> 01:31:26.36
And B helped you guys never come here again.

1628
01:31:26.36 --> 01:31:28.20
You know, so we're even setting up a system

1629
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:31.56
with the rehab place because it's a good place.

1630
01:31:31.56 --> 01:31:33.68
And it takes people from American can.

1631
01:31:33.68 --> 01:31:35.04
It's called Thousand Island rehab.

1632
01:31:35.04 --> 01:31:38.12
It's right on the border where they're with the St. Lawrence.

1633
01:31:39.32 --> 01:31:42.68
We are working on a system where as people

1634
01:31:42.68 --> 01:31:46.28
has transitional housing from rehab to normal life

1635
01:31:46.28 --> 01:31:47.76
is a bit of a problem.

1636
01:31:47.76 --> 01:31:51.24
So we are setting up, once we have the headquarters built

1637
01:31:51.24 --> 01:31:52.84
and everything by the end of the year.

1638
01:31:52.84 --> 01:31:54.96
By next year, we're hoping to have like three or four

1639
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:57.24
bunk set up where we can bring in

1640
01:31:57.24 --> 01:31:59.24
like-minded people from rehab.

1641
01:31:59.24 --> 01:32:01.12
You already have a building for HQ.

1642
01:32:01.12 --> 01:32:01.96
Are you working on it?

1643
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:03.24
We're working on it.

1644
01:32:03.24 --> 01:32:04.08
We're close.

1645
01:32:04.08 --> 01:32:05.08
We think we have something.

1646
01:32:05.08 --> 01:32:09.36
We are, I am moving to Stitzville from Orleans

1647
01:32:09.36 --> 01:32:09.96
in Ottawa.

1648
01:32:09.96 --> 01:32:13.60
That means going from the far east end to the far west end.

1649
01:32:13.60 --> 01:32:14.60
We're very close.

1650
01:32:14.60 --> 01:32:18.08
I don't want to let the cat of the bag in case,

1651
01:32:18.08 --> 01:32:20.16
like, but the guys that are helping me

1652
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:23.56
are really, guys I met in politics actually.

1653
01:32:23.56 --> 01:32:25.36
And they're really great guys.

1654
01:32:25.36 --> 01:32:29.52
And they see, you know, they've never held anything against me

1655
01:32:29.52 --> 01:32:30.40
for what I've done.

1656
01:32:30.40 --> 01:32:32.80
And if anything, they're-

1657
01:32:32.80 --> 01:32:37.20
42, it kind of sucks to be starting over again.

1658
01:32:37.20 --> 01:32:38.52
It's better than the alternative.

1659
01:32:38.52 --> 01:32:40.16
But it's better than the alternative.

1660
01:32:40.16 --> 01:32:42.72
And, you know, I could have stayed in politics

1661
01:32:42.72 --> 01:32:47.36
and, you know, it's $110,000 a year job,

1662
01:32:47.36 --> 01:32:48.80
which is great and stuff.

1663
01:32:48.80 --> 01:32:52.88
But I quit a job in the 90s

1664
01:32:52.88 --> 01:32:57.16
where I'm making like 65 grand a year in the 90s

1665
01:32:57.16 --> 01:32:58.52
as an 18 year old.

1666
01:32:58.52 --> 01:33:01.48
Putting things together for Ford,

1667
01:33:01.48 --> 01:33:04.68
making way too much money, stupid money for a 19 year old.

1668
01:33:04.68 --> 01:33:06.56
Because I wanted to join the army

1669
01:33:06.56 --> 01:33:11.56
and I went from 850 bucks a week to 520 every two weeks.

1670
01:33:12.92 --> 01:33:14.24
And I loved it.

1671
01:33:14.24 --> 01:33:15.88
And that's what Kelly and I are doing now.

1672
01:33:15.88 --> 01:33:18.60
We are spiritually rich.

1673
01:33:18.60 --> 01:33:20.56
And we are, I know we want more.

1674
01:33:20.56 --> 01:33:21.44
We're getting greedy.

1675
01:33:21.44 --> 01:33:25.36
We want more fulfillment and enrichment in our lives

1676
01:33:25.36 --> 01:33:27.92
and we just want to surround ourselves with good people.

1677
01:33:27.92 --> 01:33:30.20
Yeah, you know, and you said earlier,

1678
01:33:30.20 --> 01:33:32.000
and I held onto the thought,

1679
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.80
you said, hey, you know, you got to take care of yourself first.

1680
01:33:35.80 --> 01:33:39.24
But you also, and that's, there is definite truth to that

1681
01:33:39.24 --> 01:33:40.56
because if you don't take care of yourself,

1682
01:33:40.56 --> 01:33:42.24
you're not going to be able to help anyone else.

1683
01:33:42.24 --> 01:33:45.20
But I'm telling you, and you already know,

1684
01:33:45.20 --> 01:33:47.08
because this is what you're talking about.

1685
01:33:47.08 --> 01:33:48.000
You can take care of yourself.

1686
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.68
Once you got yourself under control,

1687
01:33:49.68 --> 01:33:52.24
there's no better reward in life than helping other people

1688
01:33:52.24 --> 01:33:53.80
and moving people in the right direction

1689
01:33:53.80 --> 01:33:56.08
and helping people find the path.

1690
01:33:56.08 --> 01:33:56.92
So.

1691
01:33:56.92 --> 01:34:00.12
Well, I mean, even through all these troubles,

1692
01:34:00.12 --> 01:34:02.20
we talked about right before the show,

1693
01:34:03.48 --> 01:34:07.32
the recruiting depot for the Canadian Armed Forces called me.

1694
01:34:07.32 --> 01:34:10.52
And I don't even think I was at a rehab yet, was I, babe?

1695
01:34:10.52 --> 01:34:11.52
No.

1696
01:34:11.52 --> 01:34:14.44
And I guess that I wasn't shy about what was going on.

1697
01:34:14.44 --> 01:34:19.16
And the top shot from every platoon now,

1698
01:34:20.36 --> 01:34:22.72
going through our recruitment depot

1699
01:34:22.72 --> 01:34:27.12
is going to get the Mass Corbable Jody Medic Topshot Award.

1700
01:34:27.12 --> 01:34:29.20
There's no greater honor.

1701
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:31.76
And I get to go and give a speech now

1702
01:34:31.76 --> 01:34:33.52
to these troopers, these young troops,

1703
01:34:33.52 --> 01:34:37.76
as they leave their now soldiers.

1704
01:34:37.76 --> 01:34:39.76
They've finished basic training.

1705
01:34:39.76 --> 01:34:42.80
And I get to go and tell them, like, hey, look at me.

1706
01:34:42.80 --> 01:34:43.76
Look at what I did.

1707
01:34:43.76 --> 01:34:45.76
And I'm a complete fuck up.

1708
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:48.96
But, you know, it's who you are on the inside.

1709
01:34:48.96 --> 01:34:50.80
It's how you redeem yourself.

1710
01:34:50.80 --> 01:34:52.56
And it's how you look after those

1711
01:34:52.56 --> 01:34:55.36
around you that makes you who you are.

1712
01:34:55.36 --> 01:34:56.56
At least that's what I think.

1713
01:34:56.56 --> 01:34:58.56
Look at, and here I am giving you a speech

1714
01:34:58.56 --> 01:35:01.52
less than three months after finishing rehab,

1715
01:35:01.52 --> 01:35:03.44
or just like three months after.

1716
01:35:03.44 --> 01:35:04.72
And you know what?

1717
01:35:04.72 --> 01:35:07.20
Hey, as awesome as the congressional mental of honor

1718
01:35:07.20 --> 01:35:10.24
or the Victoria Cross for me is,

1719
01:35:10.24 --> 01:35:12.24
having something named after me,

1720
01:35:12.24 --> 01:35:16.08
that all the new troops see and some will point out

1721
01:35:16.08 --> 01:35:17.56
and go, I fucking want that.

1722
01:35:17.56 --> 01:35:19.56
I want that award.

1723
01:35:19.56 --> 01:35:22.68
That's the best greatest honor the military

1724
01:35:22.68 --> 01:35:24.92
probably could have bestowed on you.

1725
01:35:24.92 --> 01:35:29.000
To say, you are someone we want our troops,

1726
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.08
our youngest newest members,

1727
01:35:31.08 --> 01:35:36.20
to aspire to be like, man, I got a job.

1728
01:35:36.20 --> 01:35:37.000
I got a job.

1729
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.64
My job is to be that guy.

1730
01:35:39.64 --> 01:35:43.80
And if it means you screw up, it means you own it

1731
01:35:43.80 --> 01:35:46.68
and you dust yourself off and you carry on.

1732
01:35:46.68 --> 01:35:49.40
And you find a way and you, and you know what?

1733
01:35:49.40 --> 01:35:50.84
And that's all I'm going to keep doing.

1734
01:35:50.84 --> 01:35:54.04
That's why like friends like you and things like this,

1735
01:35:54.04 --> 01:35:58.36
podcasting in our generation is how we do that.

1736
01:35:58.36 --> 01:36:01.08
And like again, I'm talking about it.

1737
01:36:01.08 --> 01:36:02.92
I'm trying not to get emotional

1738
01:36:02.92 --> 01:36:05.000
because there's a master corporal,

1739
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Joe D. Minic, Topshot Award.

1740
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.08
And it's not just at like some unit,

1741
01:36:09.08 --> 01:36:10.84
mass hall, you know, like the,

1742
01:36:10.84 --> 01:36:14.12
what every new recruit going through the depot

1743
01:36:14.12 --> 01:36:15.24
is going to see this thing.

1744
01:36:16.52 --> 01:36:18.76
And it's, anyway,

1745
01:36:18.76 --> 01:36:19.88
I don't know what else to say.

1746
01:36:19.88 --> 01:36:22.28
I'm speechless about it, Frank.

1747
01:36:22.28 --> 01:36:23.80
Well, that's awesome.

1748
01:36:23.80 --> 01:36:27.40
And I mean, that is, that's just an awesome honor

1749
01:36:27.40 --> 01:36:29.56
that that these young recruits are going to come in.

1750
01:36:29.56 --> 01:36:33.88
And then every single recruit in the Canadian Army is going to know who you are

1751
01:36:33.88 --> 01:36:35.24
and what you represent.

1752
01:36:35.24 --> 01:36:36.44
And part of what they're going to see

1753
01:36:36.44 --> 01:36:39.000
of what you represent once they know your story

1754
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.48
is they're going to realize that you're not perfect.

1755
01:36:41.48 --> 01:36:41.80
Yeah.

1756
01:36:41.80 --> 01:36:43.96
And they're going to realize that no one's perfect.

1757
01:36:43.96 --> 01:36:48.20
And they're going to realize that they can get control

1758
01:36:48.20 --> 01:36:50.28
over the things that have gotten out of control.

1759
01:36:50.28 --> 01:36:52.76
And they can move forward in a positive way

1760
01:36:52.76 --> 01:36:55.80
and make the absolute best out of what they're doing with their life.

1761
01:36:55.80 --> 01:36:58.36
Like, I don't know about you, but like something like that

1762
01:36:58.36 --> 01:37:01.96
puts you in a position to be a mentor to these people.

1763
01:37:01.96 --> 01:37:02.76
Oh, for sure.

1764
01:37:02.76 --> 01:37:05.48
And like same with like my podcast, your pod,

1765
01:37:06.60 --> 01:37:10.20
people come to you, I'm sure, out of the blue with lots of things.

1766
01:37:10.20 --> 01:37:14.60
And it's, you know, sometimes I, you know,

1767
01:37:14.60 --> 01:37:17.000
I stopped responding for a while because of where I was,

1768
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.28
but now I'm getting back, like I wear your t-shirts again,

1769
01:37:20.28 --> 01:37:21.08
bro.

1770
01:37:21.08 --> 01:37:22.20
Like I have to do you see that?

1771
01:37:22.20 --> 01:37:23.96
Do we say that on the, on the, yeah.

1772
01:37:23.96 --> 01:37:24.60
Yeah.

1773
01:37:24.60 --> 01:37:26.52
I'm going to, I want one of those before I leave.

1774
01:37:26.52 --> 01:37:30.60
You know, because discipline does equal freedom.

1775
01:37:30.60 --> 01:37:34.04
And it doesn't mean you govern every moment of your day, but it means

1776
01:37:34.04 --> 01:37:37.56
that more discipline you are with yourself, the more free you are to be yourself.

1777
01:37:38.36 --> 01:37:40.36
Does that make more, that's how I've always seen.

1778
01:37:40.36 --> 01:37:42.28
That's what discipline equals random is, man.

1779
01:37:42.28 --> 01:37:43.48
That's what it is.

1780
01:37:43.48 --> 01:37:47.64
You know, I feel like we're coming to a natural conclusion here, maybe I'm wrong,

1781
01:37:49.64 --> 01:37:50.52
thanks, man.

1782
01:37:50.52 --> 01:37:51.32
Like it's both of you.

1783
01:37:51.32 --> 01:37:56.20
Like I just, I, I need people like you that, like guys, I look up to you, man.

1784
01:37:56.20 --> 01:37:57.72
Like I know, I know it's weird.

1785
01:37:57.72 --> 01:37:58.20
It's weird.

1786
01:37:58.20 --> 01:37:59.08
It should be the way around.

1787
01:37:59.08 --> 01:37:59.40
I know.

1788
01:37:59.40 --> 01:38:01.40
But I do, man.

1789
01:38:01.40 --> 01:38:02.84
I want that top shot award.

1790
01:38:02.84 --> 01:38:03.40
I do.

1791
01:38:03.40 --> 01:38:09.32
And, you know, you really, you really help me a lot, you know?

1792
01:38:09.32 --> 01:38:11.96
And, and I hope I can repay the favor one day.

1793
01:38:11.96 --> 01:38:18.60
And, and I, and I know you say, I don't know you, but I, I, I, I couldn't do, I couldn't achieve what I'm

1794
01:38:18.60 --> 01:38:21.48
doing now without the support of people like you and my life.

1795
01:38:22.20 --> 01:38:23.16
And I go of course.

1796
01:38:23.16 --> 01:38:27.64
Well, you're right, you don't know me anything and the only thing that I would like is for you to stay on the path.

1797
01:38:27.64 --> 01:38:34.92
And Roger that, moving forward and keep kicking ass and stay clean and keep doing what you know you're capable of doing and what you're destined to do.

1798
01:38:34.92 --> 01:38:36.04
Good copy.

1799
01:38:36.04 --> 01:38:36.68
Check.

1800
01:38:37.88 --> 01:38:39.48
All right, I think that is a natural.

1801
01:38:39.48 --> 01:38:42.04
Cool. Can I just go to the quick shout out to Wardall?

1802
01:38:42.04 --> 01:38:42.68
Yeah.

1803
01:38:42.68 --> 01:38:43.88
This is the Wardall T-shirt.

1804
01:38:43.88 --> 01:38:45.24
I think it's called the Dreamcatcher.

1805
01:38:45.24 --> 01:38:46.68
He's a veteran in Canada.

1806
01:38:46.68 --> 01:38:48.92
Go ahead, look him up in order some of his T-shirts help him out.

1807
01:38:49.64 --> 01:38:51.72
A full, is it 20?

1808
01:38:51.72 --> 01:38:54.76
I think 20% of his proceeds go to charity for veterans.

1809
01:38:54.76 --> 01:38:55.56
That's awesome.

1810
01:38:55.56 --> 01:38:55.96
Yeah.

1811
01:38:55.96 --> 01:38:56.76
Wardall.

1812
01:38:56.76 --> 01:38:57.48
Wardall.

1813
01:38:57.48 --> 01:38:58.28
The Wardall.

1814
01:38:58.28 --> 01:39:00.84
You got like a blog and he has some cool cool swag.

1815
01:39:00.84 --> 01:39:01.56
That's good.

1816
01:39:01.56 --> 01:39:01.72
Good dude.

1817
01:39:01.72 --> 01:39:02.28
It's good dude.

1818
01:39:02.28 --> 01:39:03.08
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1819
01:39:03.08 --> 01:39:03.72
Look in T-shirt.

1820
01:39:03.72 --> 01:39:04.92
Yeah, I noticed it on the way in.

1821
01:39:04.92 --> 01:39:05.16
Yeah.

1822
01:39:05.16 --> 01:39:06.84
I'll have him send you some.

1823
01:39:06.84 --> 01:39:07.32
Check.

1824
01:39:07.32 --> 01:39:08.84
Um, echo.

1825
01:39:08.84 --> 01:39:09.68
Yes.

1826
01:39:09.68 --> 01:39:11.48
You know, speaking of the path.

1827
01:39:11.48 --> 01:39:11.96
Sure.

1828
01:39:11.96 --> 01:39:12.60
And whatnot.

1829
01:39:14.60 --> 01:39:16.68
We see it's easy to slip off the path from time to time.

1830
01:39:16.68 --> 01:39:17.48
It is.

1831
01:39:17.48 --> 01:39:19.24
We want to get back on the path.

1832
01:39:19.24 --> 01:39:21.56
If we want to stay on the path, recommendations.

1833
01:39:21.56 --> 01:39:21.96
Sure.

1834
01:39:22.60 --> 01:39:23.56
From echo trials.

1835
01:39:23.56 --> 01:39:23.96
Cool.

1836
01:39:25.40 --> 01:39:26.68
I recommend you to.

1837
01:39:26.68 --> 01:39:28.44
So, as a strip.

1838
01:39:28.44 --> 01:39:30.44
So, you were talking about, um,

1839
01:39:31.08 --> 01:39:31.40
what?

1840
01:39:31.40 --> 01:39:32.84
I'm starting to judge you by the way.

1841
01:39:32.84 --> 01:39:33.56
I like that.

1842
01:39:33.56 --> 01:39:33.80
Good.

1843
01:39:33.80 --> 01:39:34.28
Yeah.

1844
01:39:34.28 --> 01:39:36.04
So, relieving stress.

1845
01:39:36.04 --> 01:39:37.72
You will have a good time with you, Jitter.

1846
01:39:37.72 --> 01:39:38.28
Yeah.

1847
01:39:38.28 --> 01:39:41.32
I'm finally comfortable enough with my leg stumps.

1848
01:39:41.32 --> 01:39:44.04
That I feel like I can roll with people without feeling inadequate.

1849
01:39:44.04 --> 01:39:49.08
I've rolled with, uh, quite a few people with various stumps.

1850
01:39:49.08 --> 01:39:49.88
Yeah.

1851
01:39:49.88 --> 01:39:50.28
Yes.

1852
01:39:50.28 --> 01:39:50.92
Stunk legs.

1853
01:39:50.92 --> 01:39:51.56
Stumps.

1854
01:39:51.56 --> 01:39:51.88
In the building.

1855
01:39:51.88 --> 01:39:52.92
Arms stumps.

1856
01:39:52.92 --> 01:39:53.72
Yeah.

1857
01:39:53.72 --> 01:39:54.04
Um, Matt.

1858
01:39:54.04 --> 01:39:55.72
I know we got Jeff Rial here.

1859
01:39:55.72 --> 01:39:57.64
He's, he's got no hand.

1860
01:39:57.64 --> 01:39:58.84
And he chokes you with that stumps.

1861
01:39:58.84 --> 01:40:00.28
He's got a stomp and he chokes you with it.

1862
01:40:00.28 --> 01:40:00.68
Oh, yeah.

1863
01:40:00.68 --> 01:40:02.12
Sticks it right into your Adam's apple.

1864
01:40:02.12 --> 01:40:02.92
Oh.

1865
01:40:02.92 --> 01:40:04.36
And that, certain position.

1866
01:40:04.36 --> 01:40:05.32
Part of the game.

1867
01:40:05.32 --> 01:40:05.72
Yeah.

1868
01:40:05.72 --> 01:40:05.72
Yeah.

1869
01:40:05.72 --> 01:40:05.72
Yeah.

1870
01:40:05.72 --> 01:40:07.32
That's going to use it.

1871
01:40:07.32 --> 01:40:07.72
Yeah.

1872
01:40:07.72 --> 01:40:09.72
People know hands and legs both.

1873
01:40:09.72 --> 01:40:10.72
Yeah.

1874
01:40:10.72 --> 01:40:12.44
I'm, I'm finally able to deal with it.

1875
01:40:12.44 --> 01:40:12.44
Yeah.

1876
01:40:12.44 --> 01:40:13.72
And you're below the knee too.

1877
01:40:13.72 --> 01:40:15.16
So you, you can do stuff.

1878
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:15.48
Oh, yeah.

1879
01:40:15.48 --> 01:40:16.12
This all comes.

1880
01:40:16.12 --> 01:40:16.12
Stuff.

1881
01:40:16.12 --> 01:40:16.92
Yeah.

1882
01:40:16.92 --> 01:40:17.12
I can do things.

1883
01:40:17.12 --> 01:40:17.80
Can go down.

1884
01:40:17.80 --> 01:40:18.76
Oh, yeah.

1885
01:40:18.76 --> 01:40:19.12
So yeah.

1886
01:40:19.12 --> 01:40:19.92
That's a good way.

1887
01:40:19.92 --> 01:40:21.000
Stress relief.

1888
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.04
That's one of those ones that it's probably one of the biggest stress relievers.

1889
01:40:25.04 --> 01:40:25.56
There is.

1890
01:40:25.56 --> 01:40:26.56
Yeah.

1891
01:40:26.56 --> 01:40:30.12
That I've had in the way I have my life is very, you know, simple.

1892
01:40:30.12 --> 01:40:32.000
Even right when you begin.

1893
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.44
He gets super stressed out.

1894
01:40:33.44 --> 01:40:34.44
Yeah.

1895
01:40:34.44 --> 01:40:36.04
As we know, sometimes you get a dishwasher.

1896
01:40:36.04 --> 01:40:40.68
You know, if you're going to go so as soft bowls to their spot or silverware over there,

1897
01:40:40.68 --> 01:40:41.68
that's a tough decision.

1898
01:40:41.68 --> 01:40:42.68
We get stressed out.

1899
01:40:42.68 --> 01:40:43.68
Luckily, you can do the digits.

1900
01:40:43.68 --> 01:40:44.68
You two really bad.

1901
01:40:44.68 --> 01:40:46.28
Anyway, I'd be stressed about the state of the day.

1902
01:40:46.28 --> 01:40:47.88
I trained to, I did two a day yesterday.

1903
01:40:47.88 --> 01:40:48.88
I did two.

1904
01:40:48.88 --> 01:40:49.88
I did morning digits two after noon.

1905
01:40:49.88 --> 01:40:51.68
Just morning, ghee, evening, no ghee.

1906
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:52.68
Dang what?

1907
01:40:52.68 --> 01:40:54.88
My stress level was super low.

1908
01:40:54.88 --> 01:40:55.88
Yeah.

1909
01:40:55.88 --> 01:40:56.88
That was so low.

1910
01:40:56.88 --> 01:40:57.88
I was so stoked.

1911
01:40:57.88 --> 01:41:00.40
But that's, yeah, I did one yesterday and I went.

1912
01:41:00.40 --> 01:41:02.40
I thought, uh, new day.

1913
01:41:02.40 --> 01:41:03.40
Okay.

1914
01:41:03.40 --> 01:41:04.40
Check it out.

1915
01:41:04.40 --> 01:41:05.40
Avoidance.

1916
01:41:05.40 --> 01:41:08.96
Well, you know, my feelings are less, um, how should I say available?

1917
01:41:08.96 --> 01:41:09.96
Yeah, yeah.

1918
01:41:09.96 --> 01:41:10.96
As far as I can.

1919
01:41:10.96 --> 01:41:11.96
You're working.

1920
01:41:11.96 --> 01:41:13.96
Doing various things.

1921
01:41:13.96 --> 01:41:17.56
The less stress relief due to, right?

1922
01:41:17.56 --> 01:41:22.20
Where that's like a double, maybe even a triple, actually, maybe even like an endless

1923
01:41:22.20 --> 01:41:25.72
benefit situation due to it.

1924
01:41:25.72 --> 01:41:26.72
But as far as the stress is.

1925
01:41:26.72 --> 01:41:28.32
There's a mental stress relief, yes.

1926
01:41:28.32 --> 01:41:29.32
Yeah.

1927
01:41:29.32 --> 01:41:33.04
And it's so, like, you're going to like, you're going to, you're going to hate it.

1928
01:41:33.04 --> 01:41:34.52
That first, you need it choked.

1929
01:41:34.52 --> 01:41:35.52
Yeah.

1930
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:37.04
You're going to be a lot more prepared for that.

1931
01:41:37.04 --> 01:41:40.44
People little, little, 120 pound people are going to choke you.

1932
01:41:40.44 --> 01:41:44.32
They're going to, they're going to arm lock you and you're going to think this is not fair.

1933
01:41:44.32 --> 01:41:45.32
Yeah.

1934
01:41:45.32 --> 01:41:46.72
But it's not fair.

1935
01:41:46.72 --> 01:41:47.72
They know.

1936
01:41:47.72 --> 01:41:50.76
I've been like a spectator of the community for so long.

1937
01:41:50.76 --> 01:41:51.76
Yeah.

1938
01:41:51.76 --> 01:41:55.72
Before I got wounded, I want, my plan was to come home and actually like train and

1939
01:41:55.72 --> 01:41:57.96
try and get a one MMA flight.

1940
01:41:57.96 --> 01:41:58.96
Yeah.

1941
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:02.96
Because in Canada, like it wasn't that big a thing for 2006.

1942
01:42:02.96 --> 01:42:05.48
And then, you know, they'll get blown up.

1943
01:42:05.48 --> 01:42:10.44
But I'm fully prepared for the humility that that's very good.

1944
01:42:10.44 --> 01:42:13.04
Just to bring is because I need it.

1945
01:42:13.04 --> 01:42:14.04
Yeah.

1946
01:42:14.04 --> 01:42:15.04
Yeah.

1947
01:42:15.04 --> 01:42:16.04
We all do.

1948
01:42:16.04 --> 01:42:18.92
If you look at it and since you're who you are and how you are, you're going to,

1949
01:42:18.92 --> 01:42:22.76
you're going to have trouble avoiding the part that it's like, yes, this person is like

1950
01:42:22.76 --> 01:42:23.76
beating me up.

1951
01:42:23.76 --> 01:42:26.28
And can beat me up even though this is small.

1952
01:42:26.28 --> 01:42:30.44
So you're going to, you're probably not going to avoid that element of, well, I'm reading

1953
01:42:30.44 --> 01:42:31.44
it.

1954
01:42:31.44 --> 01:42:34.64
It's a common reaction to what's happening.

1955
01:42:34.64 --> 01:42:35.64
Yes.

1956
01:42:35.64 --> 01:42:39.04
So as long as I train to prepare for that, like if I train my mind, right?

1957
01:42:39.04 --> 01:42:40.04
Yes.

1958
01:42:40.04 --> 01:42:44.40
But it doesn't change that if Kelly jokes me out, I will feel inadequate for a while.

1959
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:45.40
Yes.

1960
01:42:45.40 --> 01:42:47.40
And that's, so that part, but it's a lie.

1961
01:42:47.40 --> 01:42:51.68
I feel a little bit more, yeah.

1962
01:42:51.68 --> 01:42:53.08
But there's another part.

1963
01:42:53.08 --> 01:42:54.08
Is it's not a machine?

1964
01:42:54.08 --> 01:42:57.52
No, I don't turn red for a little plus.

1965
01:42:57.52 --> 01:43:02.84
There's the other part of it is if you look at it as a problem solving situation, you

1966
01:43:02.84 --> 01:43:04.84
know, like it's like, okay, he's not beating me up.

1967
01:43:04.84 --> 01:43:05.84
He is, by the way.

1968
01:43:05.84 --> 01:43:07.40
But you don't think of it like that.

1969
01:43:07.40 --> 01:43:08.40
You think, okay, this is the issue.

1970
01:43:08.40 --> 01:43:09.40
This is a problem.

1971
01:43:09.40 --> 01:43:10.40
And I'm going to solve.

1972
01:43:10.40 --> 01:43:12.40
Yes, I got to learn how to do it.

1973
01:43:12.40 --> 01:43:16.44
I don't take a while, but in any puzzle situation, you know, okay, I'm not going to learn

1974
01:43:16.44 --> 01:43:17.44
this thing overnight.

1975
01:43:17.44 --> 01:43:19.04
It's a huge 5,000 piece puzzle.

1976
01:43:19.04 --> 01:43:20.04
Right.

1977
01:43:20.04 --> 01:43:21.04
It's infinite.

1978
01:43:21.04 --> 01:43:23.88
But, you know, you still look at it in that sort of way.

1979
01:43:23.88 --> 01:43:25.44
And then you can start to accept.

1980
01:43:25.44 --> 01:43:26.44
Okay.

1981
01:43:26.44 --> 01:43:32.24
The thing I really appeals to it, what appeals about it to me is that even practitioners

1982
01:43:32.24 --> 01:43:35.28
like a viewer guy's his level, like, jock was level, even.

1983
01:43:35.28 --> 01:43:37.96
What's his name, the guy who's always separated us?

1984
01:43:37.96 --> 01:43:39.28
Well, jock was in that issue.

1985
01:43:39.28 --> 01:43:40.88
You've been at a percentage of what?

1986
01:43:40.88 --> 01:43:41.88
12?

1987
01:43:41.88 --> 01:43:42.88
Something like that.

1988
01:43:42.88 --> 01:43:43.88
What's the guy, Gracie?

1989
01:43:43.88 --> 01:43:45.52
Even he says he learns every day.

1990
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:46.52
Yeah, that's true.

1991
01:43:46.52 --> 01:43:50.32
And that's what it feels like, you know, it appeals to me because there's no true

1992
01:43:50.32 --> 01:43:51.32
experts.

1993
01:43:51.32 --> 01:43:54.68
I mean, there are people that will kick your ass every day, but they even they have someone

1994
01:43:54.68 --> 01:43:55.68
that could kick their ass.

1995
01:43:55.68 --> 01:43:56.68
Yeah, always learning.

1996
01:43:56.68 --> 01:43:57.68
Yes.

1997
01:43:57.68 --> 01:44:04.56
So, when you do digital, you're going to need a key.

1998
01:44:04.56 --> 01:44:07.28
Because you've got to do key and no key, you've got to do both.

1999
01:44:07.28 --> 01:44:08.28
I think.

2000
01:44:08.28 --> 01:44:09.92
We have a fully stand the path.

2001
01:44:09.92 --> 01:44:10.92
100% both.

2002
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:11.92
So you need a key.

2003
01:44:11.92 --> 01:44:12.92
Get an origin key.

2004
01:44:12.92 --> 01:44:13.92
You know what I have?

2005
01:44:13.92 --> 01:44:14.92
What kind of key do I get?

2006
01:44:14.92 --> 01:44:15.92
Now you know, origin key.

2007
01:44:15.92 --> 01:44:16.92
You saw the one I just got.

2008
01:44:16.92 --> 01:44:17.92
You got one for me?

2009
01:44:17.92 --> 01:44:18.92
Yeah.

2010
01:44:18.92 --> 01:44:19.92
We will.

2011
01:44:19.92 --> 01:44:20.92
We will.

2012
01:44:20.92 --> 01:44:21.92
We'll get one for you.

2013
01:44:21.92 --> 01:44:22.92
Okay.

2014
01:44:22.92 --> 01:44:23.92
Roger that.

2015
01:44:23.92 --> 01:44:24.92
No doubt.

2016
01:44:24.92 --> 01:44:25.92
Yeah.

2017
01:44:25.92 --> 01:44:26.92
What's your origin?

2018
01:44:26.92 --> 01:44:27.92
Well, rock origin.

2019
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:28.92
All the keys in the world straight up.

2020
01:44:28.92 --> 01:44:29.92
Yeah.

2021
01:44:29.92 --> 01:44:30.92
Naturally.

2022
01:44:30.92 --> 01:44:31.92
Made in America.

2023
01:44:31.92 --> 01:44:34.48
I know you're from Canada, but made in America actually means a lot.

2024
01:44:34.48 --> 01:44:35.48
Yeah.

2025
01:44:35.48 --> 01:44:36.48
Hey, bro.

2026
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:37.48
North America.

2027
01:44:37.48 --> 01:44:38.48
We're taking North America.

2028
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:41.12
So you can say, made in North America, which is also true.

2029
01:44:41.12 --> 01:44:43.12
America means quality.

2030
01:44:43.12 --> 01:44:44.12
It does.

2031
01:44:44.12 --> 01:44:45.12
Except for 80s cars.

2032
01:44:45.12 --> 01:44:46.12
That's it.

2033
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:47.12
80s cars.

2034
01:44:47.12 --> 01:44:48.12
But even then you put them back together yourself.

2035
01:44:48.12 --> 01:44:50.12
And it's just a piece of pride that you can have in the driveway.

2036
01:44:50.12 --> 01:44:51.12
You're good.

2037
01:44:51.12 --> 01:44:52.12
Indeed.

2038
01:44:52.12 --> 01:44:53.12
And these keys are no exception.

2039
01:44:53.12 --> 01:44:54.12
By the way.

2040
01:44:54.12 --> 01:44:56.12
So yeah, you got to origin main.com.

2041
01:44:56.12 --> 01:44:57.12
That's where you can get them.

2042
01:44:57.12 --> 01:44:58.12
They got a lot of other stuff.

2043
01:44:58.12 --> 01:44:59.12
Do you do too?

2044
01:44:59.12 --> 01:45:00.12
And just regular stuff.

2045
01:45:00.12 --> 01:45:02.12
Regular life stuff.

2046
01:45:02.12 --> 01:45:03.12
Life stuff.

2047
01:45:03.12 --> 01:45:04.12
Like jeans.

2048
01:45:04.12 --> 01:45:05.12
Yes.

2049
01:45:05.12 --> 01:45:06.12
That's what I got to get you.

2050
01:45:06.12 --> 01:45:07.12
I got to get some orange and jeans.

2051
01:45:07.12 --> 01:45:08.12
A big fan of jeans I fit right.

2052
01:45:08.12 --> 01:45:09.12
Yeah.

2053
01:45:09.12 --> 01:45:10.12
They're legit.

2054
01:45:10.12 --> 01:45:12.12
And you get your supplements there.

2055
01:45:12.12 --> 01:45:15.12
Which will keep you in the game on the path 100%.

2056
01:45:15.12 --> 01:45:16.12
Mm.

2057
01:45:16.12 --> 01:45:17.12
Oh yeah.

2058
01:45:17.12 --> 01:45:18.12
100%.

2059
01:45:18.12 --> 01:45:19.12
100%.

2060
01:45:19.12 --> 01:45:20.12
Yeah.

2061
01:45:20.12 --> 01:45:21.12
Yeah.

2062
01:45:21.12 --> 01:45:22.12
And I really use 100%.

2063
01:45:22.12 --> 01:45:23.12
I do.

2064
01:45:23.12 --> 01:45:25.12
But do you want to say 99 just in case?

2065
01:45:25.12 --> 01:45:26.12
No, no.

2066
01:45:26.12 --> 01:45:27.12
No.

2067
01:45:27.12 --> 01:45:28.12
No.

2068
01:45:28.12 --> 01:45:29.12
That's committed.

2069
01:45:29.12 --> 01:45:31.12
That's normally normally I would say 90.

2070
01:45:31.12 --> 01:45:33.12
Saying, you know, the one person will rule my get it.

2071
01:45:33.12 --> 01:45:34.12
Not in this case.

2072
01:45:34.12 --> 01:45:38.12
Actually, they've proven to be the most important supplements I've ever taken better than

2073
01:45:38.12 --> 01:45:39.12
Jocos.

2074
01:45:39.12 --> 01:45:40.12
They are Jocos actually.

2075
01:45:40.12 --> 01:45:41.12
Oh, wait.

2076
01:45:41.12 --> 01:45:44.12
So Jocco krill super krill.

2077
01:45:44.12 --> 01:45:46.12
Jocco joint warfare.

2078
01:45:46.12 --> 01:45:47.12
Me in origin labs.

2079
01:45:47.12 --> 01:45:48.12
Yeah.

2080
01:45:48.12 --> 01:45:49.12
Roger that.

2081
01:45:49.12 --> 01:45:50.12
So you know, that's where that's huge.

2082
01:45:50.12 --> 01:45:51.12
Yeah.

2083
01:45:51.12 --> 01:45:52.12
Yeah.

2084
01:45:52.12 --> 01:45:55.12
But now I see, but nonetheless, they are straight up.

2085
01:45:55.12 --> 01:45:56.12
They'll keep you in the game.

2086
01:45:56.12 --> 01:45:57.12
Same thing.

2087
01:45:57.12 --> 01:45:58.12
Okay.

2088
01:45:58.12 --> 01:46:01.12
So discipline go, which is a little bit of a new trophy.

2089
01:46:01.12 --> 01:46:02.12
Yeah.

2090
01:46:02.12 --> 01:46:07.12
But Jason Gardner did his first echelon front gig.

2091
01:46:07.12 --> 01:46:08.12
Nice.

2092
01:46:08.12 --> 01:46:09.12
Dang right in the game.

2093
01:46:09.12 --> 01:46:10.12
Right in the game.

2094
01:46:10.12 --> 01:46:13.12
And he was sent me a text and he was like,

2095
01:46:13.12 --> 01:46:19.12
I took this by Sarah took three discipline go 42 minutes out from the

2096
01:46:19.12 --> 01:46:20.12
commencement.

2097
01:46:20.12 --> 01:46:21.12
He was a ty was from the fire.

2098
01:46:21.12 --> 01:46:22.12
And he was like, I'm sorry.

2099
01:46:22.12 --> 01:46:25.12
And he even tacked it sounded like that to the text.

2100
01:46:25.12 --> 01:46:26.12
Yeah, that's how Jason is.

2101
01:46:26.12 --> 01:46:27.12
You were so fired up.

2102
01:46:27.12 --> 01:46:32.12
But the funny thing is he texted me earlier and he says, hey,

2103
01:46:32.12 --> 01:46:36.12
it's seven o'clock in the morning and I was at another gig.

2104
01:46:36.12 --> 01:46:40.12
And he says, hey, can you hook me up with some discipline?

2105
01:46:40.12 --> 01:46:41.12
Go.

2106
01:46:41.12 --> 01:46:43.12
And I said, I'm not at my house.

2107
01:46:43.12 --> 01:46:45.12
My wife can get you the supply.

2108
01:46:45.12 --> 01:46:46.12
I don't stand.

2109
01:46:46.12 --> 01:46:48.12
See, this is sort of like the supply thing.

2110
01:46:48.12 --> 01:46:49.12
Yeah.

2111
01:46:49.12 --> 01:46:51.12
Like, you deliver, deliver.

2112
01:46:51.12 --> 01:46:52.12
Oh, okay.

2113
01:46:52.12 --> 01:46:55.12
He went to my house picked up a couple picked up enough discipline for

2114
01:46:55.12 --> 01:46:58.12
his gig discipline go and then he hit it.

2115
01:46:58.12 --> 01:47:07.12
So, yeah, if you feel like you might need a little something to clarify your thoughts

2116
01:47:07.12 --> 01:47:12.12
through to ignite a little bit of extra brain power.

2117
01:47:12.12 --> 01:47:13.12
Yes.

2118
01:47:13.12 --> 01:47:14.12
Get yourself some discipline go.

2119
01:47:14.12 --> 01:47:17.12
You can just get the regular discipline powder drink.

2120
01:47:17.12 --> 01:47:22.12
The thing is if you're going to be doing something where let's just let me just call it what it is.

2121
01:47:22.12 --> 01:47:25.12
If you're going to have to go to the bathroom, then you don't want to.

2122
01:47:25.12 --> 01:47:28.12
Like if you're going to go on stage and talk to people for two hours and then a little bit.

2123
01:47:28.12 --> 01:47:29.12
You're going to go, I even won't want to second.

2124
01:47:29.12 --> 01:47:32.12
With Bruce by the way, I've never done and hopefully I never will do.

2125
01:47:32.12 --> 01:47:34.12
So, that's that.

2126
01:47:34.12 --> 01:47:37.12
You don't know, anyway, it's done that.

2127
01:47:37.12 --> 01:47:38.12
I don't know.

2128
01:47:38.12 --> 01:47:44.12
I mean, you might feel like you just had to like go to the bathroom so bad with the middle of a presentation.

2129
01:47:44.12 --> 01:47:45.12
Yeah, but you don't know.

2130
01:47:45.12 --> 01:47:46.12
No, you don't know.

2131
01:47:46.12 --> 01:47:48.12
You don't like what you let me put it to.

2132
01:47:48.12 --> 01:47:51.12
Okay, I used to before going in the field.

2133
01:47:51.12 --> 01:47:53.12
Hydrate like crazy.

2134
01:47:53.12 --> 01:47:54.12
Yeah.

2135
01:47:54.12 --> 01:47:58.12
And then you see you hydrate like crazy and then you get on the helicopter and you got a piss.

2136
01:47:58.12 --> 01:48:00.12
And then you got like a 48 minute and it's suit.

2137
01:48:00.12 --> 01:48:01.12
You're getting on the helicopter.

2138
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:05.12
Like, okay, I just should go right now and you don't because someone's like,

2139
01:48:05.12 --> 01:48:06.12
Hey, come on.

2140
01:48:06.12 --> 01:48:07.12
We'll get in here.

2141
01:48:07.12 --> 01:48:10.12
So you get in and then you're flying and you have to go to the bathroom so bad the whole time.

2142
01:48:10.12 --> 01:48:11.12
The whole time.

2143
01:48:11.12 --> 01:48:16.12
And like hurt. I've run off the hook and just passed. Yeah.

2144
01:48:16.12 --> 01:48:19.12
Like because the whole flight, you just write you just read it.

2145
01:48:19.12 --> 01:48:23.12
So there are some times where that is really a problem.

2146
01:48:23.12 --> 01:48:24.12
So discipline, go.

2147
01:48:24.12 --> 01:48:25.12
Can help you out with that.

2148
01:48:25.12 --> 01:48:26.12
You see, I'm learning also.

2149
01:48:26.12 --> 01:48:27.12
Mulk.

2150
01:48:27.12 --> 01:48:28.12
Some additional protein.

2151
01:48:28.12 --> 01:48:31.12
Going back in the gym or if you already in the gym, whatever.

2152
01:48:31.12 --> 01:48:32.12
Mulk.

2153
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:32.12
Boom.

2154
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:35.12
To another two pronged effect with the mulk as well.

2155
01:48:35.12 --> 01:48:38.12
Additional protein and dessert.

2156
01:48:38.12 --> 01:48:39.12
The up.

2157
01:48:39.12 --> 01:48:41.12
Because there are tasty delicious.

2158
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:46.12
Don't forget about the warrior kid mulk, which kids everywhere are basically.

2159
01:48:46.12 --> 01:48:59.12
If you want your kid to be just a complete destroyer on the mats in school and everything that they do, get them where you're getting mulk.

2160
01:48:59.12 --> 01:49:00.12
Yep.

2161
01:49:00.12 --> 01:49:01.12
And they'll be happy about it.

2162
01:49:01.12 --> 01:49:06.12
I went off and I had to tell, who was it?

2163
01:49:06.12 --> 01:49:07.12
Tyler.

2164
01:49:07.12 --> 01:49:09.12
You know, Tyler, the kid from origin.

2165
01:49:09.12 --> 01:49:13.12
He was doing like the, the Jaco in New York City, little video.

2166
01:49:13.12 --> 01:49:16.12
And I said, I was going crazy.

2167
01:49:16.12 --> 01:49:17.12
You kind of like I just did.

2168
01:49:17.12 --> 01:49:24.12
And I was saying that if you don't give your kids warrior kid mulk, that's child abuse.

2169
01:49:24.12 --> 01:49:26.12
You said, what?

2170
01:49:26.12 --> 01:49:27.12
That's nice.

2171
01:49:27.12 --> 01:49:28.12
That's nice.

2172
01:49:28.12 --> 01:49:28.12
That's nice.

2173
01:49:28.12 --> 01:49:29.12
That's nice.

2174
01:49:29.12 --> 01:49:30.12
Now I'm being real.

2175
01:49:30.12 --> 01:49:36.12
If you have a kid and you give your kid strawberry quick, which is literally filled with sugar.

2176
01:49:36.12 --> 01:49:37.12
And crap.

2177
01:49:37.12 --> 01:49:41.12
Or you could give them strawberry mulk, which tastes just as good.

2178
01:49:41.12 --> 01:49:46.12
If not better, and it's 100% good for the kid, how is that not child abuse?

2179
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:47.12
It is not child abuse.

2180
01:49:47.12 --> 01:49:48.12
Okay.

2181
01:49:48.12 --> 01:49:49.12
So there you go.

2182
01:49:49.12 --> 01:49:50.12
You're thinking about your choices.

2183
01:49:50.12 --> 01:49:54.12
We're going to call the child protective services when we're watching.

2184
01:49:54.12 --> 01:49:56.12
We're seeing quick getting bought.

2185
01:49:56.12 --> 01:49:57.12
You're going down.

2186
01:49:57.12 --> 01:49:59.12
You're going to get in trouble.

2187
01:49:59.12 --> 01:50:01.12
So, click might have something to say about that.

2188
01:50:01.12 --> 01:50:02.12
Chocolate and strawberry.

2189
01:50:02.12 --> 01:50:03.12
Yeah, of course they do.

2190
01:50:03.12 --> 01:50:08.12
They're going to pay someone and put more money into some politicians pocket to come after me,

2191
01:50:08.12 --> 01:50:10.12
because we're trying to make kids stronger.

2192
01:50:10.12 --> 01:50:11.12
Bring it on.

2193
01:50:11.12 --> 01:50:13.12
We're all bringing it on.

2194
01:50:13.12 --> 01:50:15.12
So that's that.

2195
01:50:15.12 --> 01:50:16.12
Check it.

2196
01:50:16.12 --> 01:50:17.12
It is also.

2197
01:50:17.12 --> 01:50:18.12
Chocolate is stored.

2198
01:50:18.12 --> 01:50:20.12
It's called Jocco Store.

2199
01:50:20.12 --> 01:50:23.12
And this is where we get our apparel.

2200
01:50:23.12 --> 01:50:26.12
You want to represent while you're on the path.

2201
01:50:26.12 --> 01:50:27.12
It's good.

2202
01:50:27.12 --> 01:50:28.12
We've got some new stuff on there.

2203
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:29.12
Lightweight hoodies.

2204
01:50:29.12 --> 01:50:30.12
What do you say?

2205
01:50:30.12 --> 01:50:31.12
What did you say?

2206
01:50:31.12 --> 01:50:33.12
You say Brady's vote.

2207
01:50:33.12 --> 01:50:34.12
I bet that's fine.

2208
01:50:34.12 --> 01:50:37.12
And Brady just said Brady didn't even say heavyweight hoodies.

2209
01:50:37.12 --> 01:50:40.12
He said standard hoodies, which I don't even want to stand.

2210
01:50:40.12 --> 01:50:41.12
I want to have you wait.

2211
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:43.12
I want to Canadian level.

2212
01:50:43.12 --> 01:50:45.12
You don't even like to know what I'm saying.

2213
01:50:45.12 --> 01:50:46.12
No, no, it's standard.

2214
01:50:46.12 --> 01:50:47.12
Kind of.

2215
01:50:47.12 --> 01:50:48.12
It's too easy to be average.

2216
01:50:48.12 --> 01:50:49.12
Yeah.

2217
01:50:49.12 --> 01:50:49.12
Standard.

2218
01:50:49.12 --> 01:50:50.12
Well, okay.

2219
01:50:50.12 --> 01:50:52.12
Brady, I respect it.

2220
01:50:52.12 --> 01:50:53.12
I respect his opinion.

2221
01:50:53.12 --> 01:50:54.12
That wasn't just his opinion.

2222
01:50:54.12 --> 01:50:56.12
That was the opinion of a vote.

2223
01:50:56.12 --> 01:50:57.12
With a winner vote.

2224
01:50:57.12 --> 01:50:58.12
Oh, like our one of those polls.

2225
01:50:58.12 --> 01:50:59.12
Yeah.

2226
01:50:59.12 --> 01:51:02.12
And it was 60 40 in favor of standard.

2227
01:51:02.12 --> 01:51:04.12
If he would have had heavyweight on there,

2228
01:51:04.12 --> 01:51:05.12
it could have been a whole scenario.

2229
01:51:05.12 --> 01:51:06.12
Good.

2230
01:51:06.12 --> 01:51:09.12
Well, good news is we already have standard hoodies.

2231
01:51:09.12 --> 01:51:09.12
Okay.

2232
01:51:09.12 --> 01:51:11.12
And that's a good thing.

2233
01:51:11.12 --> 01:51:12.12
We have lightweight hoodies.

2234
01:51:12.12 --> 01:51:13.12
Dirty minute.

2235
01:51:13.12 --> 01:51:14.12
What about you?

2236
01:51:14.12 --> 01:51:15.12
Lightweight hoodies.

2237
01:51:15.12 --> 01:51:16.12
Yeah, your name.

2238
01:51:16.12 --> 01:51:16.12
Just in general.

2239
01:51:16.12 --> 01:51:18.12
Don't just think that it says light weight though.

2240
01:51:18.12 --> 01:51:19.12
He isn't going to like that.

2241
01:51:19.12 --> 01:51:20.12
I just want to.

2242
01:51:20.12 --> 01:51:20.12
I want to.

2243
01:51:20.12 --> 01:51:21.12
I want to.

2244
01:51:21.12 --> 01:51:22.12
You're just a hoodie.

2245
01:51:22.12 --> 01:51:23.12
Why are you getting a hoodie?

2246
01:51:23.12 --> 01:51:28.12
What if you're not because people in the world exist with different.

2247
01:51:28.12 --> 01:51:29.12
Different.

2248
01:51:29.12 --> 01:51:35.12
He's different thresholds different takes on the hoodie situation rather than you and apparently

2249
01:51:35.12 --> 01:51:36.12
do not know.

2250
01:51:36.12 --> 01:51:40.12
I rock a thin like a thin material hoodie.

2251
01:51:40.12 --> 01:51:41.12
Okay.

2252
01:51:41.12 --> 01:51:43.12
That's what I did underneath my vest.

2253
01:51:43.12 --> 01:51:44.12
Yeah.

2254
01:51:44.12 --> 01:51:45.12
Okay.

2255
01:51:45.12 --> 01:51:46.12
You're over with echo that.

2256
01:51:46.12 --> 01:51:46.12
Yeah.

2257
01:51:46.12 --> 01:51:47.12
No, but I have another.

2258
01:51:47.12 --> 01:51:48.12
I have thicker.

2259
01:51:48.12 --> 01:51:49.12
That's cool.

2260
01:51:49.12 --> 01:51:51.12
He just said you're with me and you just said no no.

2261
01:51:51.12 --> 01:51:53.12
So you know, but I'm saying I'm with myself.

2262
01:51:53.12 --> 01:51:54.12
I got evidence.

2263
01:51:54.12 --> 01:51:57.12
I have several layers of hoodie.

2264
01:51:57.12 --> 01:51:58.12
Okay.

2265
01:51:58.12 --> 01:52:03.12
As I'm saying, I have very thick for cold extreme weather and I have very thin for

2266
01:52:03.12 --> 01:52:04.12
you know, like California.

2267
01:52:04.12 --> 01:52:05.12
Yeah.

2268
01:52:05.12 --> 01:52:05.12
See?

2269
01:52:05.12 --> 01:52:06.12
It's what he is with me.

2270
01:52:06.12 --> 01:52:08.12
But I did never call it like weight.

2271
01:52:08.12 --> 01:52:09.12
Yeah.

2272
01:52:09.12 --> 01:52:10.12
You know what I think.

2273
01:52:10.12 --> 01:52:13.12
I just call it a shirt material.

2274
01:52:13.12 --> 01:52:18.12
Maybe it's like a light weight is a classification for warmth.

2275
01:52:18.12 --> 01:52:19.12
Okay.

2276
01:52:19.12 --> 01:52:22.12
So maybe call it a temperate temperate temperate temperate temperate temperate temperate.

2277
01:52:22.12 --> 01:52:24.12
It's working title.

2278
01:52:24.12 --> 01:52:25.12
Right.

2279
01:52:25.12 --> 01:52:27.12
You know, you're a very weird, weird, weird weather.

2280
01:52:27.12 --> 01:52:28.12
Yeah.

2281
01:52:28.12 --> 01:52:29.12
Pretty.

2282
01:52:29.12 --> 01:52:30.12
Yeah.

2283
01:52:30.12 --> 01:52:31.12
For sure.

2284
01:52:31.12 --> 01:52:34.12
You used to say this thing when like in the paper.

2285
01:52:34.12 --> 01:52:35.12
Incoming.

2286
01:52:35.12 --> 01:52:36.12
That's in coming.

2287
01:52:36.12 --> 01:52:37.12
Yeah.

2288
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:37.12
Incoming.

2289
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:38.12
So lightweight temperate.

2290
01:52:38.12 --> 01:52:40.12
Hoodies, whichever incoming to little anyway.

2291
01:52:40.12 --> 01:52:41.12
Some other new stuff on there.

2292
01:52:41.12 --> 01:52:43.12
Anyway, it's on jockelstore.com.

2293
01:52:43.12 --> 01:52:45.12
Also you can get more rash guards.

2294
01:52:45.12 --> 01:52:47.12
You really want to represent.

2295
01:52:47.12 --> 01:52:52.12
So just to help out like a layman, a grass guard is to avoid getting like drag

2296
01:52:52.12 --> 01:52:55.12
across the mats and other people skin, right?

2297
01:52:55.12 --> 01:52:56.12
Getting your skin.

2298
01:52:56.12 --> 01:52:57.12
That's part of it.

2299
01:52:57.12 --> 01:53:02.12
Part of it is also you're just wearing it because if you and I are grappling, my fingers and toes and hands.

2300
01:53:02.12 --> 01:53:02.12
Right.

2301
01:53:02.12 --> 01:53:06.12
You can get caught in your clothes and it's a little bit of a pain.

2302
01:53:06.12 --> 01:53:07.12
Roger that.

2303
01:53:07.12 --> 01:53:08.12
Okay.

2304
01:53:08.12 --> 01:53:09.12
It's better with the sweat.

2305
01:53:09.12 --> 01:53:11.12
Sit you it like if you're wearing this shirt, which is cool.

2306
01:53:11.12 --> 01:53:14.12
By the way, if you're wearing that shirt and you sweat all in it, you did 10

2307
01:53:14.12 --> 01:53:15.12
Round.

2308
01:53:15.12 --> 01:53:16.12
You know, and you're sweating all.

2309
01:53:16.12 --> 01:53:18.12
It's that's like splashing everywhere.

2310
01:53:18.12 --> 01:53:19.12
You know, it's everything.

2311
01:53:19.12 --> 01:53:20.12
The rash.

2312
01:53:20.12 --> 01:53:23.12
It's like it's like a cotton can become a very abrasive.

2313
01:53:23.12 --> 01:53:25.12
When it's wet as we knew.

2314
01:53:25.12 --> 01:53:26.12
Yeah.

2315
01:53:26.12 --> 01:53:28.12
You know, or some people wear it underneath the guise.

2316
01:53:28.12 --> 01:53:29.12
Some people.

2317
01:53:29.12 --> 01:53:29.12
Roger.

2318
01:53:29.12 --> 01:53:32.12
So you know, if you're training guise today, for weeks.

2319
01:53:32.12 --> 01:53:35.12
So rash guards are a must for training jiu-jitsu.

2320
01:53:35.12 --> 01:53:36.12
I maybe want to say that.

2321
01:53:36.12 --> 01:53:37.12
I know what I'm doing.

2322
01:53:37.12 --> 01:53:39.12
Yeah, they're not a must, but they're a nice day.

2323
01:53:39.12 --> 01:53:40.12
It's nice.

2324
01:53:40.12 --> 01:53:41.12
They're cool.

2325
01:53:41.12 --> 01:53:41.12
Yeah.

2326
01:53:41.12 --> 01:53:42.12
Very good.

2327
01:53:42.12 --> 01:53:43.12
I prefer big time.

2328
01:53:43.12 --> 01:53:48.12
Oh, unless we have them, we have some represent the path.

2329
01:53:48.12 --> 01:53:49.12
Big time in your jiu-jitsu.

2330
01:53:49.12 --> 01:53:52.12
Or whatever else you're doing cycling running whatever.

2331
01:53:52.12 --> 01:53:53.12
Some women's stuff on that.

2332
01:53:53.12 --> 01:53:54.12
Some hats on their both.

2333
01:53:54.12 --> 01:53:56.12
Flex hit n.

2334
01:53:56.12 --> 01:53:57.12
Trucker hats.

2335
01:53:57.12 --> 01:53:59.12
Jiu-jitsu flex under trucker hat.

2336
01:53:59.12 --> 01:54:01.12
Ooh, a big fan of the trucker hat.

2337
01:54:01.12 --> 01:54:02.12
There you go.

2338
01:54:02.12 --> 01:54:04.12
Because it gives me the ventilation.

2339
01:54:04.12 --> 01:54:05.12
Yeah.

2340
01:54:05.12 --> 01:54:06.12
You like that echo?

2341
01:54:06.12 --> 01:54:07.12
Yeah, I like that.

2342
01:54:07.12 --> 01:54:08.12
And we offer that by the way.

2343
01:54:08.12 --> 01:54:10.12
But if you flex fit a winter.

2344
01:54:10.12 --> 01:54:11.12
I see.

2345
01:54:11.12 --> 01:54:12.12
We have winter in Canada.

2346
01:54:12.12 --> 01:54:13.12
So flex fit keeps the heat in.

2347
01:54:13.12 --> 01:54:14.12
Oh, yeah.

2348
01:54:14.12 --> 01:54:15.12
Oh, yeah.

2349
01:54:15.12 --> 01:54:16.12
Because it's very humid in Ontario.

2350
01:54:16.12 --> 01:54:18.12
What we are being these two, this speaking of winter.

2351
01:54:18.12 --> 01:54:19.12
Oh, okay.

2352
01:54:19.12 --> 01:54:20.12
There you go.

2353
01:54:20.12 --> 01:54:21.12
So that the beauty of the book.

2354
01:54:21.12 --> 01:54:22.12
We call it a Tuk.

2355
01:54:22.12 --> 01:54:23.12
Tuk.

2356
01:54:23.12 --> 01:54:24.12
We call it a Tuk in Canada.

2357
01:54:24.12 --> 01:54:25.12
Because it won't.

2358
01:54:25.12 --> 01:54:26.12
Well, yeah.

2359
01:54:26.12 --> 01:54:27.12
Yeah.

2360
01:54:27.12 --> 01:54:30.12
Or just anything that goes on your head that looks a knitted cap.

2361
01:54:30.12 --> 01:54:31.12
Yeah.

2362
01:54:31.12 --> 01:54:33.12
And it's called in the Army Field Manual.

2363
01:54:33.12 --> 01:54:34.12
A Tuk.

2364
01:54:34.12 --> 01:54:35.12
Yeah, we have that.

2365
01:54:35.12 --> 01:54:36.12
And you got your Duk.

2366
01:54:36.12 --> 01:54:37.12
I'm impartial.

2367
01:54:37.12 --> 01:54:38.12
I don't wear nothing.

2368
01:54:38.12 --> 01:54:39.12
I don't wear hats anymore.

2369
01:54:39.12 --> 01:54:40.12
Yeah, no.

2370
01:54:40.12 --> 01:54:41.12
As much.

2371
01:54:41.12 --> 01:54:42.12
You don't have to.

2372
01:54:42.12 --> 01:54:44.12
You have a beautiful perfectly round head.

2373
01:54:44.12 --> 01:54:45.12
I guess.

2374
01:54:45.12 --> 01:54:46.12
I'm always hiding my hair.

2375
01:54:46.12 --> 01:54:48.12
Like when I have hair.

2376
01:54:48.12 --> 01:54:49.12
When I have hair.

2377
01:54:49.12 --> 01:54:50.12
He's a money.

2378
01:54:50.12 --> 01:54:51.12
But I get it gets curly.

2379
01:54:51.12 --> 01:54:53.12
And then it gets like really hard to manage.

2380
01:54:53.12 --> 01:54:54.12
Yeah.

2381
01:54:54.12 --> 01:54:55.12
Very pretty.

2382
01:54:55.12 --> 01:54:56.12
I'm managing.

2383
01:54:56.12 --> 01:55:00.12
Actually, I've just a picture of my Instagram if you know, if you followed Jody on his Instagram.

2384
01:55:00.12 --> 01:55:01.12
Sure.

2385
01:55:01.12 --> 01:55:03.12
I've made it 16.

2386
01:55:03.12 --> 01:55:06.12
Look at all kinds of rough neck with my hair.

2387
01:55:06.12 --> 01:55:08.12
I'm going to go this thick.

2388
01:55:08.12 --> 01:55:11.12
And my hair is just a goddamn disaster.

2389
01:55:11.12 --> 01:55:12.12
It's beautiful.

2390
01:55:12.12 --> 01:55:13.12
Beautiful to see.

2391
01:55:13.12 --> 01:55:15.12
A wild man of Jody Medicare.

2392
01:55:15.12 --> 01:55:17.12
My favorite actor was Mel Gibson at the time.

2393
01:55:17.12 --> 01:55:18.12
I'm just going to say that.

2394
01:55:18.12 --> 01:55:19.12
I respect that.

2395
01:55:19.12 --> 01:55:20.12
Big time.

2396
01:55:20.12 --> 01:55:21.12
Nonetheless, good stuff on there.

2397
01:55:21.12 --> 01:55:26.12
If you jockelstore.com, this where you get it, if you like something, get something.

2398
01:55:26.12 --> 01:55:28.12
Also, jockelweight.

2399
01:55:28.12 --> 01:55:29.12
Jockelweight.

2400
01:55:29.12 --> 01:55:30.12
I've yet to try jockelweight.

2401
01:55:30.12 --> 01:55:31.12
He's really too sad.

2402
01:55:31.12 --> 01:55:33.12
Because I got some right here.

2403
01:55:33.12 --> 01:55:34.12
And I've been trying it all day.

2404
01:55:34.12 --> 01:55:35.12
Yeah.

2405
01:55:35.12 --> 01:55:36.12
Oh, jockelweight.

2406
01:55:36.12 --> 01:55:37.12
You can hurt your mouth.

2407
01:55:37.12 --> 01:55:38.12
The last one after the show.

2408
01:55:38.12 --> 01:55:41.12
And one of the many benefits if you don't know already, which I know you already do.

2409
01:55:41.12 --> 01:55:43.12
You can, did, live 8,000 pounds.

2410
01:55:43.12 --> 01:55:46.12
There was a guy he just deadlifted a bunch of weight recently.

2411
01:55:46.12 --> 01:55:47.12
Yeah.

2412
01:55:47.12 --> 01:55:48.12
And the road situation.

2413
01:55:48.12 --> 01:55:49.12
Yeah.

2414
01:55:49.12 --> 01:55:50.12
Yeah.

2415
01:55:50.12 --> 01:55:52.12
A lot of people are worried if they're competing in powerlifting.

2416
01:55:52.12 --> 01:55:53.12
Right.

2417
01:55:53.12 --> 01:55:53.12
Right.

2418
01:55:53.12 --> 01:55:54.12
And right.

2419
01:55:54.12 --> 01:55:57.12
And yeah, will you get tested for jockelweight T?

2420
01:55:57.12 --> 01:56:01.12
And then there already automatically going to know you're taking jockelweight T if you did it.

2421
01:56:01.12 --> 01:56:02.12
Yeah.

2422
01:56:02.12 --> 01:56:03.12
That's kind of a test.

2423
01:56:03.12 --> 01:56:04.12
That's kind of a test.

2424
01:56:04.12 --> 01:56:05.12
So you got to be careful.

2425
01:56:05.12 --> 01:56:08.12
Keep it at 7,500 in the tournament.

2426
01:56:08.12 --> 01:56:11.12
Got to send back little in the competition.

2427
01:56:11.12 --> 01:56:16.12
But other benefits are certified, USDA organic.

2428
01:56:16.12 --> 01:56:17.12
Think about that.

2429
01:56:17.12 --> 01:56:23.12
You could drink a normal energy drink and become less healthy.

2430
01:56:23.12 --> 01:56:24.12
Yeah.

2431
01:56:24.12 --> 01:56:28.12
Or you could drink jockelweight T and you could become more healthy.

2432
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:30.12
That's, is that a hard choice to make?

2433
01:56:30.12 --> 01:56:31.12
I don't think so.

2434
01:56:31.12 --> 01:56:32.12
It's not even hard choice to make.

2435
01:56:32.12 --> 01:56:34.12
Drink what's going to make you more healthy.

2436
01:56:34.12 --> 01:56:35.12
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

2437
01:56:35.12 --> 01:56:40.12
If you haven't subscribed to the podcast yet, first of all, you have issues.

2438
01:56:40.12 --> 01:56:43.12
Because there's been, this is 169.

2439
01:56:43.12 --> 01:56:47.12
And I used to think that everyone had subscribed at this point.

2440
01:56:47.12 --> 01:56:49.12
But it was actually echo Charles that proved me wrong.

2441
01:56:49.12 --> 01:56:52.12
Because somebody tweeted like, no, I just subscribed for the first time.

2442
01:56:52.12 --> 01:56:56.12
So if you haven't subscribed, subscribe through iTunes Google Play Stitch or whatever.

2443
01:56:56.12 --> 01:56:57.12
Leave some reviews.

2444
01:56:57.12 --> 01:56:58.12
I was reading reviews.

2445
01:56:58.12 --> 01:57:00.12
I always review the reviews is what I do.

2446
01:57:00.12 --> 01:57:01.12
Yeah.

2447
01:57:01.12 --> 01:57:02.12
That people are like healthy.

2448
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:02.12
Yeah.

2449
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:04.12
It's healthy to review your reviews.

2450
01:57:04.12 --> 01:57:05.12
Yeah.

2451
01:57:05.12 --> 01:57:05.12
Yeah.

2452
01:57:05.12 --> 01:57:06.12
All right.

2453
01:57:06.12 --> 01:57:09.12
And don't forget about the warrior kid podcast as well.

2454
01:57:09.12 --> 01:57:10.12
Yeah.

2455
01:57:10.12 --> 01:57:11.12
Yeah.

2456
01:57:11.12 --> 01:57:12.12
Let's not.

2457
01:57:12.12 --> 01:57:15.12
The best kids podcast that has ever been.

2458
01:57:15.12 --> 01:57:16.12
Mm-hmm.

2459
01:57:16.12 --> 01:57:17.12
Does anyone disagree with that?

2460
01:57:17.12 --> 01:57:20.12
I don't even know there was a kids qualification or category.

2461
01:57:20.12 --> 01:57:21.12
Yeah.

2462
01:57:21.12 --> 01:57:22.12
Warrior kid podcast.

2463
01:57:22.12 --> 01:57:25.12
Family and children and family are something that's like, is the category that it's under.

2464
01:57:25.12 --> 01:57:26.12
Mm-hmm.

2465
01:57:26.12 --> 01:57:27.12
And I'm sorry.

2466
01:57:27.12 --> 01:57:28.12
I did not know you had that.

2467
01:57:28.12 --> 01:57:29.12
Yeah.

2468
01:57:29.12 --> 01:57:30.12
The warrior kid podcast.

2469
01:57:30.12 --> 01:57:31.12
The time on the plug day became from the world.

2470
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:36.12
The warrior kid podcast, which I haven't put out as many as I should.

2471
01:57:36.12 --> 01:57:38.12
But there's a reason for that.

2472
01:57:38.12 --> 01:57:41.12
It's like, there's a lot that goes into it.

2473
01:57:41.12 --> 01:57:43.12
I know it might not seem like it.

2474
01:57:43.12 --> 01:57:44.12
Mm-hmm.

2475
01:57:44.12 --> 01:57:46.12
But there's a lot that I put into those.

2476
01:57:46.12 --> 01:57:47.12
I thought.

2477
01:57:47.12 --> 01:57:48.12
Yeah.

2478
01:57:48.12 --> 01:57:49.12
It's kind of my fault.

2479
01:57:49.12 --> 01:57:53.12
I feel like I haven't done what all that I could have been doing to you know how to make it happen.

2480
01:57:53.12 --> 01:57:54.12
Mm-hmm.

2481
01:57:54.12 --> 01:57:55.12
I got a work harder.

2482
01:57:55.12 --> 01:57:56.12
That's what needs to happen.

2483
01:57:56.12 --> 01:57:57.12
So there's that.

2484
01:57:57.12 --> 01:58:01.12
I know for you about the warrior kid soap, which we have some good new samples.

2485
01:58:01.12 --> 01:58:02.12
You can get the jocals.

2486
01:58:02.12 --> 01:58:03.12
So if you can get the trooper soap.

2487
01:58:03.12 --> 01:58:04.12
The trooper soap.

2488
01:58:04.12 --> 01:58:05.12
It's nice.

2489
01:58:05.12 --> 01:58:06.12
Has the rope you can hang it on?

2490
01:58:06.12 --> 01:58:07.12
Soap on a rope.

2491
01:58:07.12 --> 01:58:09.12
I risked Irish oak for ants.

2492
01:58:09.12 --> 01:58:11.12
Soap on a rope is super useful.

2493
01:58:11.12 --> 01:58:12.12
Yeah.

2494
01:58:12.12 --> 01:58:13.12
It has a real purpose.

2495
01:58:13.12 --> 01:58:14.12
You know that right?

2496
01:58:14.12 --> 01:58:15.12
Well here's the thing.

2497
01:58:15.12 --> 01:58:16.12
We used to make it in school.

2498
01:58:16.12 --> 01:58:17.12
Well I never knew about that.

2499
01:58:17.12 --> 01:58:18.12
I'm quiet here.

2500
01:58:18.12 --> 01:58:20.12
You know, soap on a rope and like I was like,

2501
01:58:20.12 --> 01:58:21.12
Oh that sounds cute.

2502
01:58:21.12 --> 01:58:22.12
You know, and then when I say,

2503
01:58:22.12 --> 01:58:24.12
Oh soap is actually on a rope.

2504
01:58:24.12 --> 01:58:24.12
Yeah.

2505
01:58:24.12 --> 01:58:25.12
Oh it's super useful.

2506
01:58:25.12 --> 01:58:26.12
So it's just kind of.

2507
01:58:26.12 --> 01:58:28.12
You never draw a bar soap again.

2508
01:58:28.12 --> 01:58:30.12
You're good to go.

2509
01:58:30.12 --> 01:58:32.12
So that's Aiden.

2510
01:58:32.12 --> 01:58:33.12
It's a big problem.

2511
01:58:33.12 --> 01:58:34.12
I'm always like kid.

2512
01:58:34.12 --> 01:58:35.12
Bar soap.

2513
01:58:35.12 --> 01:58:36.12
So it's fine.

2514
01:58:36.12 --> 01:58:38.12
And that way you can stay clean.

2515
01:58:38.12 --> 01:58:40.12
Don't forget about YouTube if you want to see.

2516
01:58:40.12 --> 01:58:42.12
If you want to see Ecos.

2517
01:58:42.12 --> 01:58:45.12
What he considers to be his legit video.

2518
01:58:45.12 --> 01:58:47.12
I never considered using that word.

2519
01:58:47.12 --> 01:58:48.12
Then you can see him there.

2520
01:58:48.12 --> 01:58:50.12
Because he thinks his videos are worth using.

2521
01:58:50.12 --> 01:58:52.12
I actually kind of agree with that kind of.

2522
01:58:52.12 --> 01:58:53.12
Ecos got some.

2523
01:58:53.12 --> 01:58:54.12
He's good at the editing.

2524
01:58:54.12 --> 01:58:55.12
Yeah.

2525
01:58:55.12 --> 01:58:56.12
He's not like that.

2526
01:58:56.12 --> 01:58:59.12
Either that or he just really does a lot of.

2527
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:02.12
Of editing and makes it so you know this it.

2528
01:59:02.12 --> 01:59:05.12
Because wouldn't it be a better editor that would make it so like.

2529
01:59:05.12 --> 01:59:06.12
Yeah.

2530
01:59:06.12 --> 01:59:08.12
Seenless that you would just not even realize.

2531
01:59:08.12 --> 01:59:09.12
You just feel it.

2532
01:59:09.12 --> 01:59:10.12
You would notice it.

2533
01:59:10.12 --> 01:59:11.12
Yes.

2534
01:59:11.12 --> 01:59:12.12
You're actually.

2535
01:59:12.12 --> 01:59:13.12
Okay.

2536
01:59:13.12 --> 01:59:14.12
No.

2537
01:59:14.12 --> 01:59:15.12
Yeah.

2538
01:59:15.12 --> 01:59:16.12
You're right.

2539
01:59:16.12 --> 01:59:17.12
When I do make those videos.

2540
01:59:17.12 --> 01:59:19.12
If they're good, not good.

2541
01:59:19.12 --> 01:59:20.12
Whatever.

2542
01:59:20.12 --> 01:59:21.12
When I do make them.

2543
01:59:21.12 --> 01:59:22.12
I make them for myself.

2544
01:59:22.12 --> 01:59:23.12
For sure.

2545
01:59:23.12 --> 01:59:24.12
Yeah.

2546
01:59:24.12 --> 01:59:25.12
I put like sound effects.

2547
01:59:25.12 --> 01:59:28.12
I shouldn't put sound effects while you're talking.

2548
01:59:28.12 --> 01:59:29.12
But you think about it.

2549
01:59:29.12 --> 01:59:30.12
I can see music.

2550
01:59:30.12 --> 01:59:31.12
Because music kind of enhances.

2551
01:59:31.12 --> 01:59:32.12
Is there how to expose it?

2552
01:59:32.12 --> 01:59:33.12
But what?

2553
01:59:33.12 --> 01:59:34.12
I can see that.

2554
01:59:34.12 --> 01:59:35.12
It's like, my effects that I put on.

2555
01:59:35.12 --> 01:59:36.12
I can see it.

2556
01:59:36.12 --> 01:59:37.12
So I made people see that you're still.

2557
01:59:37.12 --> 01:59:38.12
What you're doing.

2558
01:59:38.12 --> 01:59:39.12
It's what you're doing.

2559
01:59:39.12 --> 01:59:40.12
Yeah.

2560
01:59:40.12 --> 01:59:41.12
In the video.

2561
01:59:41.12 --> 01:59:42.12
So yes.

2562
01:59:42.12 --> 01:59:43.12
You're correct.

2563
01:59:43.12 --> 01:59:44.12
Psychological warfare.

2564
01:59:44.12 --> 01:59:45.12
That's now.

2565
01:59:45.12 --> 01:59:46.12
You can listen to it.

2566
01:59:46.12 --> 01:59:47.12
If you need help.

2567
01:59:47.12 --> 01:59:48.12
I got a moment of weakness.

2568
01:59:48.12 --> 01:59:50.12
It actually I've been listening to it a lot in the last three months.

2569
01:59:50.12 --> 01:59:51.12
I like to hear that.

2570
01:59:51.12 --> 01:59:52.12
Hey.

2571
01:59:52.12 --> 01:59:53.12
Back to it.

2572
01:59:53.12 --> 01:59:57.12
You're a thing where you're saying earlier where you couldn't look at the shirt.

2573
01:59:57.12 --> 01:59:58.12
I couldn't wear it.

2574
01:59:58.12 --> 01:59:59.12
I couldn't wear it.

2575
01:59:59.12 --> 02:00:00.12
I couldn't.

2576
02:00:00.12 --> 02:00:01.12
I could look.

2577
02:00:01.12 --> 02:00:02.12
I could wear it.

2578
02:00:02.12 --> 02:00:03.12
I'm interested in the opposite though.

2579
02:00:03.12 --> 02:00:06.12
It's like when you put it on, you can't skip a workout now.

2580
02:00:06.12 --> 02:00:07.12
You can't slack.

2581
02:00:07.12 --> 02:00:08.12
It's the same concept.

2582
02:00:08.12 --> 02:00:09.12
You walk straighter.

2583
02:00:09.12 --> 02:00:10.12
Yeah.

2584
02:00:10.12 --> 02:00:12.12
You have a little bit more purpose in the looking your eye.

2585
02:00:12.12 --> 02:00:13.12
Yeah.

2586
02:00:13.12 --> 02:00:14.12
But like I didn't wear jocos.

2587
02:00:14.12 --> 02:00:16.12
I didn't wear any of the veteran t-shirt companies.

2588
02:00:16.12 --> 02:00:17.12
Like I just.

2589
02:00:17.12 --> 02:00:18.12
Yeah.

2590
02:00:18.12 --> 02:00:20.12
When you put it on, you got to like you got a.

2591
02:00:20.12 --> 02:00:23.12
I walked out of rehab wearing your shirt.

2592
02:00:23.12 --> 02:00:24.12
I like that.

2593
02:00:24.12 --> 02:00:25.12
Yeah.

2594
02:00:25.12 --> 02:00:26.12
And it's just.

2595
02:00:26.12 --> 02:00:27.12
And it's going to sound a little corny.

2596
02:00:27.12 --> 02:00:29.12
But it's kind of just weird having one of your friends.

2597
02:00:29.12 --> 02:00:30.12
Peptalk you at a bed.

2598
02:00:30.12 --> 02:00:32.12
I'm going to go ahead and say that.

2599
02:00:32.12 --> 02:00:33.12
You know, putting on a.

2600
02:00:33.12 --> 02:00:34.12
I'm putting on a psychological warfare.

2601
02:00:34.12 --> 02:00:35.12
Psychological warfare.

2602
02:00:35.12 --> 02:00:36.12
I'm like a logical warfare.

2603
02:00:36.12 --> 02:00:37.12
I'll put it on repeat.

2604
02:00:37.12 --> 02:00:39.12
And it's like somebody you hang with.

2605
02:00:39.12 --> 02:00:41.12
It's just kind of like, I get a jocco.

2606
02:00:41.12 --> 02:00:42.12
I'm a.

2607
02:00:42.12 --> 02:00:43.12
I need to work harder.

2608
02:00:43.12 --> 02:00:44.12
Okay.

2609
02:00:44.12 --> 02:00:45.12
Can I take a stick to you yesterday?

2610
02:00:45.12 --> 02:00:46.12
Like I get up at six.

2611
02:00:46.12 --> 02:00:47.12
It's not jocco.

2612
02:00:47.12 --> 02:00:50.12
But it's the best I could do right now.

2613
02:00:50.12 --> 02:00:51.12
You know, it's really weird.

2614
02:00:51.12 --> 02:00:53.12
It's when I have to listen to psychological warfare.

2615
02:00:53.12 --> 02:00:54.12
Yeah.

2616
02:00:54.12 --> 02:00:55.12
That would be the most weird thing.

2617
02:00:55.12 --> 02:00:56.12
That is the weirdest thing.

2618
02:00:56.12 --> 02:00:57.12
Or the most normal.

2619
02:00:57.12 --> 02:00:59.12
Or kind of like, or it's the most amazing.

2620
02:00:59.12 --> 02:01:00.12
I've never.

2621
02:01:00.12 --> 02:01:01.12
Yeah.

2622
02:01:01.12 --> 02:01:03.12
Maybe it be the spouse situation.

2623
02:01:03.12 --> 02:01:04.12
Actually, that's a good idea.

2624
02:01:04.12 --> 02:01:08.12
If you are a person that's trying to do something, be good to cut yourself a couple of tracks to

2625
02:01:08.12 --> 02:01:11.12
explain to yourself why you're trying to do this thing.

2626
02:01:11.12 --> 02:01:14.12
So in the moment of weakness comes, you could listen to me.

2627
02:01:14.12 --> 02:01:15.12
Sure.

2628
02:01:15.12 --> 02:01:16.12
But you could actually listen to yourself.

2629
02:01:16.12 --> 02:01:17.12
Actually, that's a.

2630
02:01:17.12 --> 02:01:18.12
That's a great idea.

2631
02:01:18.12 --> 02:01:19.12
I'm going to do that.

2632
02:01:19.12 --> 02:01:20.12
I'm going to do that.

2633
02:01:20.12 --> 02:01:21.12
Right now.

2634
02:01:21.12 --> 02:01:23.12
Like, it's this is my presence.

2635
02:01:23.12 --> 02:01:24.12
Or this is my future self.

2636
02:01:24.12 --> 02:01:26.12
It's like I've heard of people doing that.

2637
02:01:26.12 --> 02:01:29.12
I'm going to be slacking on whatever.

2638
02:01:29.12 --> 02:01:31.12
And I feel exactly what it's for.

2639
02:01:31.12 --> 02:01:34.12
But they'll be like, they'll put an audio note.

2640
02:01:34.12 --> 02:01:37.12
And they'll say, this is your past self or whatever.

2641
02:01:37.12 --> 02:01:38.12
Saying to you.

2642
02:01:38.12 --> 02:01:39.12
Future echo.

2643
02:01:39.12 --> 02:01:40.12
Listen closely.

2644
02:01:40.12 --> 02:01:40.12
Yes.

2645
02:01:40.12 --> 02:01:41.12
Exactly.

2646
02:01:41.12 --> 02:01:41.12
Right.

2647
02:01:41.12 --> 02:01:42.12
Saying, hey, this is what you're thinking right now.

2648
02:01:42.12 --> 02:01:43.12
This is what you're feeling right now.

2649
02:01:43.12 --> 02:01:44.12
Don't do it.

2650
02:01:44.12 --> 02:01:45.12
You know, it's like you're talking to somebody.

2651
02:01:45.12 --> 02:01:46.12
I've heard of that.

2652
02:01:46.12 --> 02:01:46.12
Yeah.

2653
02:01:46.12 --> 02:01:47.12
I can't.

2654
02:01:47.12 --> 02:01:47.12
I don't know.

2655
02:01:47.12 --> 02:01:48.12
I can't.

2656
02:01:48.12 --> 02:01:49.12
That sounds like a problem for future.

2657
02:01:49.12 --> 02:01:50.12
Jody and Kelly.

2658
02:01:50.12 --> 02:01:51.12
Yeah.

2659
02:01:51.12 --> 02:01:52.12
Exactly.

2660
02:01:52.12 --> 02:01:53.12
You can cook it.

2661
02:01:53.12 --> 02:01:54.12
Yeah.

2662
02:01:54.12 --> 02:01:56.12
You like you dealt with that future.

2663
02:01:56.12 --> 02:01:57.12
Jody Kelly didn't you.

2664
02:01:57.12 --> 02:01:58.12
I like that.

2665
02:01:58.12 --> 02:01:59.12
I like that.

2666
02:01:59.12 --> 02:02:00.12
We're going to try that.

2667
02:02:00.12 --> 02:02:01.12
We'll let you know how it works.

2668
02:02:01.12 --> 02:02:02.12
I like it.

2669
02:02:02.12 --> 02:02:03.12
I'll tell you right now.

2670
02:02:03.12 --> 02:02:04.12
It sounds good in theory.

2671
02:02:04.12 --> 02:02:07.12
But I'm all like this obey myself.

2672
02:02:07.12 --> 02:02:09.12
Way quicker than all this obey you.

2673
02:02:09.12 --> 02:02:10.12
Well, that's a good point.

2674
02:02:10.12 --> 02:02:11.12
And I think a lot of people like that.

2675
02:02:11.12 --> 02:02:13.12
That's probably a people on both sides of the coin.

2676
02:02:13.12 --> 02:02:14.12
Yeah.

2677
02:02:14.12 --> 02:02:16.12
Because eventually you'd be like, I'm not listening to Joko.

2678
02:02:16.12 --> 02:02:17.12
He's a good guy.

2679
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:20.12
He's he's he's he's he's crazy.

2680
02:02:20.12 --> 02:02:21.12
Right.

2681
02:02:21.12 --> 02:02:23.12
But they like it yourself.

2682
02:02:23.12 --> 02:02:24.12
That's not that.

2683
02:02:24.12 --> 02:02:25.12
No escape.

2684
02:02:25.12 --> 02:02:27.12
If it's a goal that you set for yourself.

2685
02:02:27.12 --> 02:02:28.12
Not my goal.

2686
02:02:28.12 --> 02:02:29.12
It's goal you set for yourself.

2687
02:02:29.12 --> 02:02:30.12
True.

2688
02:02:30.12 --> 02:02:32.12
I'm my own worst critic.

2689
02:02:32.12 --> 02:02:33.12
So I don't know.

2690
02:02:33.12 --> 02:02:34.12
I think you're right.

2691
02:02:34.12 --> 02:02:35.12
Right.

2692
02:02:35.12 --> 02:02:36.12
You promised yourself as way easier.

2693
02:02:36.12 --> 02:02:37.12
Yeah.

2694
02:02:37.12 --> 02:02:39.12
Because you might be used to that or it's weird.

2695
02:02:39.12 --> 02:02:40.12
Yeah.

2696
02:02:40.12 --> 02:02:41.12
I think you'd use both.

2697
02:02:41.12 --> 02:02:45.12
You also check out a flipside canvas dot com.

2698
02:02:45.12 --> 02:02:52.12
This is Dakota Meyer from podcast 115.

2699
02:02:52.12 --> 02:02:56.12
And he's selling basically badass prints.

2700
02:02:56.12 --> 02:02:58.12
Is that what you call prints?

2701
02:02:58.12 --> 02:02:59.12
Prens.

2702
02:02:59.12 --> 02:03:01.12
You can get prints of what really cool stuff.

2703
02:03:01.12 --> 02:03:02.12
Very smart work.

2704
02:03:02.12 --> 02:03:03.12
Like movie scenes.

2705
02:03:03.12 --> 02:03:04.12
Things like that.

2706
02:03:04.12 --> 02:03:06.12
Like there's a couple of them sitting over there.

2707
02:03:06.12 --> 02:03:07.12
Good.

2708
02:03:07.12 --> 02:03:08.12
You get one.

2709
02:03:08.12 --> 02:03:09.12
He made.

2710
02:03:09.12 --> 02:03:10.12
You can get one of the stuff.

2711
02:03:10.12 --> 02:03:11.12
He's making that stuff.

2712
02:03:11.12 --> 02:03:12.12
Yeah.

2713
02:03:12.12 --> 02:03:13.12
Just plenty of course freedom.

2714
02:03:13.12 --> 02:03:13.12
So yeah.

2715
02:03:13.12 --> 02:03:14.12
If you want to support.

2716
02:03:14.12 --> 02:03:15.12
What's the call?

2717
02:03:15.12 --> 02:03:17.12
Flipside canvas dot com.

2718
02:03:17.12 --> 02:03:20.12
And actually the reason it's called flipside is because one of the last things

2719
02:03:20.12 --> 02:03:24.12
that one of his rows said don't before they went into that battle was I'll see on the flipside.

2720
02:03:24.12 --> 02:03:26.12
That's what the story is behind that.

2721
02:03:26.12 --> 02:03:28.12
So support Dakota.

2722
02:03:28.12 --> 02:03:30.12
He's the man and check it out.

2723
02:03:30.12 --> 02:03:32.12
You can also get these.

2724
02:03:32.12 --> 02:03:35.12
Well, they're kind of reminders to you.

2725
02:03:35.12 --> 02:03:38.12
But you can hang up and get reminded.

2726
02:03:38.12 --> 02:03:38.12
Oh yeah.

2727
02:03:38.12 --> 02:03:41.12
Because we need to get reminded whether it's psychological warfare,

2728
02:03:41.12 --> 02:03:43.12
whether it's a print.

2729
02:03:43.12 --> 02:03:44.12
Keep yourself on the path.

2730
02:03:44.12 --> 02:03:45.12
Whether it's a t-shirt.

2731
02:03:45.12 --> 02:03:47.12
Keep yourself on the path.

2732
02:03:47.12 --> 02:03:47.12
Yeah.

2733
02:03:47.12 --> 02:03:49.12
These things have an impact.

2734
02:03:49.12 --> 02:03:50.12
Yeah.

2735
02:03:50.12 --> 02:03:53.12
And those reminders are actually way more like powerful.

2736
02:03:53.12 --> 02:03:55.12
These are powerful.

2737
02:03:55.12 --> 02:04:01.12
But they're more powerful than you might think because think about like even like with drinking or something like this where.

2738
02:04:01.12 --> 02:04:07.12
If you have like a planned day tomorrow where it has no room for drinking that day.

2739
02:04:07.12 --> 02:04:08.12
No room.

2740
02:04:08.12 --> 02:04:12.12
No room for drinking the night before or that day if you have it all planned out.

2741
02:04:12.12 --> 02:04:15.12
You're probably you'll drink you're likely to drink way less.

2742
02:04:15.12 --> 02:04:20.12
But if you don't, it's almost like you sort of forget to stay focused on what you have to do.

2743
02:04:20.12 --> 02:04:22.12
Almost like a way of forgetting.

2744
02:04:22.12 --> 02:04:23.12
Yeah.

2745
02:04:23.12 --> 02:04:27.12
That's why if you have a plan day like you get more done rather than because you you've

2746
02:04:27.12 --> 02:04:31.12
Fossuseptable till like what do I feel like to you know you're led more with what you feel like.

2747
02:04:31.12 --> 02:04:34.12
The weird thing is when you're dealing with addiction,

2748
02:04:34.12 --> 02:04:36.12
that's when you screw up the most.

2749
02:04:36.12 --> 02:04:42.12
The day that you have the big presentation, the big meeting that night before is when you will.

2750
02:04:42.12 --> 02:04:45.12
Because it's like self sabotage or something.

2751
02:04:45.12 --> 02:04:46.12
100% self sabotage.

2752
02:04:46.12 --> 02:04:50.12
Because you want to get caught because you know you're doing the wrong things.

2753
02:04:50.12 --> 02:04:55.12
You know what? A lot of what might be heavier over the last two for the last two years was like I hope someone I think

2754
02:04:55.12 --> 02:05:03.12
Psycholot or subconscious was like yeah somebody like because it became my actions became almost arrogant like it might boldness.

2755
02:05:03.12 --> 02:05:06.12
Anyway, we're done with all that. Let's finish the commercials.

2756
02:05:06.12 --> 02:05:12.12
These are more like announcements. Tids to stay on the past. It's all the joggoyling podcast.

2757
02:05:12.12 --> 02:05:13.12
You can do it every once.

2758
02:05:13.12 --> 02:05:14.12
True.

2759
02:05:14.12 --> 02:05:16.12
So homedimp right. We're doing homedimp.

2760
02:05:16.12 --> 02:05:17.12
You go on it.

2761
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:19.12
Dot com. This is where you get your kettlebells.

2762
02:05:19.12 --> 02:05:22.12
I have all the monkey bells that they put out.

2763
02:05:22.12 --> 02:05:23.12
Let's take five years ago.

2764
02:05:23.12 --> 02:05:24.12
Remember that?

2765
02:05:24.12 --> 02:05:25.12
Oh yeah.

2766
02:05:25.12 --> 02:05:25.12
I got them too.

2767
02:05:25.12 --> 02:05:27.12
And I got the mace.

2768
02:05:27.12 --> 02:05:28.12
The quad mace.

2769
02:05:28.12 --> 02:05:29.12
The quad mace.

2770
02:05:29.12 --> 02:05:30.12
That's the head on it.

2771
02:05:30.12 --> 02:05:30.12
Yeah.

2772
02:05:30.12 --> 02:05:33.12
Do you have like a regular routine with the mace?

2773
02:05:33.12 --> 02:05:34.12
I had one.

2774
02:05:34.12 --> 02:05:35.12
Yes.

2775
02:05:35.12 --> 02:05:37.12
So I meant I actually didn't want to.

2776
02:05:37.12 --> 02:05:41.12
I actually jacked my elbows because of all the shooting I did as a sniper.

2777
02:05:41.12 --> 02:05:45.12
So I had to build up my inner like because of what's in the inside.

2778
02:05:45.12 --> 02:05:47.12
It's the golfer's elbow.

2779
02:05:47.12 --> 02:05:48.12
This is like tennis.

2780
02:05:48.12 --> 02:05:49.12
This is good.

2781
02:05:49.12 --> 02:05:52.12
Anyway, I had to build up the tenons and then I could swing them.

2782
02:05:52.12 --> 02:05:53.12
Yeah.

2783
02:05:53.12 --> 02:05:54.12
See, I'm not so interested.

2784
02:05:54.12 --> 02:05:55.12
You try to do it a little routine.

2785
02:05:55.12 --> 02:05:56.12
If you're not used to that,

2786
02:05:56.12 --> 02:05:58.12
you'll feel all those little weird omassels that you know.

2787
02:05:58.12 --> 02:06:01.12
You know, one of my buddies served a house here in San Diego.

2788
02:06:01.12 --> 02:06:02.12
And he sends me a text.

2789
02:06:02.12 --> 02:06:03.12
He's out of town.

2790
02:06:03.12 --> 02:06:05.12
He's in the deaves.

2791
02:06:05.12 --> 02:06:08.12
He goes, hey man, sold the house, escrow closes tomorrow.

2792
02:06:08.12 --> 02:06:09.12
It's done.

2793
02:06:09.12 --> 02:06:12.12
I got a tire there and some other like bumper plates.

2794
02:06:12.12 --> 02:06:14.12
Whatever if you want to go grab it.

2795
02:06:14.12 --> 02:06:15.12
I'm not I'm not taking it.

2796
02:06:15.12 --> 02:06:16.12
So if you want to get it otherwise,

2797
02:06:16.12 --> 02:06:18.12
I got to get it moved by someone.

2798
02:06:18.12 --> 02:06:19.12
So it was a little bit of a, you know,

2799
02:06:19.12 --> 02:06:20.12
good deal for him.

2800
02:06:20.12 --> 02:06:21.12
Good deal for me.

2801
02:06:21.12 --> 02:06:24.12
And it's been raining here and something kind of funny.

2802
02:06:24.12 --> 02:06:26.12
Anyways, I showed up at the house and you know,

2803
02:06:26.12 --> 02:06:27.12
I was pretty psyched to get a tire.

2804
02:06:27.12 --> 02:06:29.12
You know, we're talking about a big tractor tire.

2805
02:06:29.12 --> 02:06:30.12
Yeah, big tractor tire.

2806
02:06:30.12 --> 02:06:30.12
Yeah.

2807
02:06:30.12 --> 02:06:32.12
But I was thinking like a big tractor tire.

2808
02:06:32.12 --> 02:06:37.12
You know, you could, you know, easily thrown a vehicle or something like that.

2809
02:06:37.12 --> 02:06:40.12
It was like freaking massive.

2810
02:06:40.12 --> 02:06:43.12
So like some like the big foot would be in the huge.

2811
02:06:43.12 --> 02:06:44.12
Huge.

2812
02:06:44.12 --> 02:06:46.12
It's absolutely huge.

2813
02:06:46.12 --> 02:06:47.12
I barely got it.

2814
02:06:47.12 --> 02:06:49.12
And you know, my giant van.

2815
02:06:49.12 --> 02:06:54.12
I barely, bit literally barely got into the most the biggest van you could buy.

2816
02:06:54.12 --> 02:06:56.12
I barely got it this year.

2817
02:06:56.12 --> 02:06:58.12
After I, and it's where it was all filled with water.

2818
02:06:58.12 --> 02:07:00.12
I had to get a scoop all the water.

2819
02:07:00.12 --> 02:07:03.12
Now, where my flip flops, it was a nightmare.

2820
02:07:03.12 --> 02:07:06.12
So to my buddy that, then you know who you are.

2821
02:07:06.12 --> 02:07:08.12
I got your tire to my backyard.

2822
02:07:08.12 --> 02:07:09.12
I'm psyched now.

2823
02:07:09.12 --> 02:07:10.12
Well, it's because now I got a cool tire.

2824
02:07:10.12 --> 02:07:14.12
I also was like one of those things like, oh, you know, I've got a call in like 30 minutes.

2825
02:07:14.12 --> 02:07:16.12
I'll just drive over their grab it real quick.

2826
02:07:16.12 --> 02:07:19.12
No, I was out there get barely making it back.

2827
02:07:19.12 --> 02:07:21.12
But you made it.

2828
02:07:21.12 --> 02:07:22.12
Yeah.

2829
02:07:22.12 --> 02:07:25.12
So don't underestimate the tire.

2830
02:07:25.12 --> 02:07:26.12
Yeah.

2831
02:07:26.12 --> 02:07:27.12
Do you clarify the tire?

2832
02:07:27.12 --> 02:07:28.12
Oh, you got a tire?

2833
02:07:28.12 --> 02:07:29.12
Yes.

2834
02:07:29.12 --> 02:07:31.12
You need a moving truck to move it.

2835
02:07:31.12 --> 02:07:32.12
Oh, okay.

2836
02:07:32.12 --> 02:07:33.12
Give me a heads up now.

2837
02:07:33.12 --> 02:07:35.12
You figured tractor tire?

2838
02:07:35.12 --> 02:07:36.12
Tractor tire.

2839
02:07:36.12 --> 02:07:37.12
Yeah.

2840
02:07:37.12 --> 02:07:43.12
So that there's a little, it's just, it's not, it's just, it's not as tall as me, but it's be.

2841
02:07:43.12 --> 02:07:44.12
Yeah, like the one here.

2842
02:07:44.12 --> 02:07:46.12
No, no, that's what I was expecting.

2843
02:07:46.12 --> 02:07:49.12
That's our gym here, you know, Victor, Jim.

2844
02:07:49.12 --> 02:07:51.12
We got to, we got to know, we got some tires.

2845
02:07:51.12 --> 02:07:52.12
We got three or four of them.

2846
02:07:52.12 --> 02:07:53.12
This thing is bigger and all of them.

2847
02:07:53.12 --> 02:07:54.12
A lot better.

2848
02:07:54.12 --> 02:07:55.12
Yeah, you got jam.

2849
02:07:55.12 --> 02:07:56.12
Yeah.

2850
02:07:56.12 --> 02:07:57.12
But you know, hey, he hooked me up.

2851
02:07:57.12 --> 02:07:58.12
Yeah.

2852
02:07:58.12 --> 02:08:00.12
That's probably vague on purpose.

2853
02:08:00.12 --> 02:08:01.12
Yeah.

2854
02:08:01.12 --> 02:08:03.12
No, he knows I'm fired up, right?

2855
02:08:03.12 --> 02:08:05.12
But most people think,

2856
02:08:05.12 --> 02:08:06.12
I guess tire.

2857
02:08:06.12 --> 02:08:07.12
He was an estimation.

2858
02:08:07.12 --> 02:08:08.12
Junk, I want to ask you.

2859
02:08:08.12 --> 02:08:09.12
You know he won't ask.

2860
02:08:09.12 --> 02:08:11.12
I can't wait for him to go get that tire.

2861
02:08:11.12 --> 02:08:11.12
Yeah.

2862
02:08:11.12 --> 02:08:12.12
Little less.

2863
02:08:12.12 --> 02:08:14.12
So tires or otherwise,

2864
02:08:14.12 --> 02:08:16.12
home gym, boom.

2865
02:08:16.12 --> 02:08:18.12
Like I say, kettlebells rings, jump rope.

2866
02:08:18.12 --> 02:08:20.12
That's a big one too.

2867
02:08:20.12 --> 02:08:21.12
Don't forget the jump rope.

2868
02:08:21.12 --> 02:08:22.12
Don't forget the jump rope.

2869
02:08:22.12 --> 02:08:24.12
A lot of cool stuff on there could work on the feet.

2870
02:08:24.12 --> 02:08:25.12
If you have feet.

2871
02:08:25.12 --> 02:08:27.12
I mean, if you can jump rope, can you jump rope?

2872
02:08:27.12 --> 02:08:28.12
No, I've tried.

2873
02:08:28.12 --> 02:08:29.12
Yeah.

2874
02:08:29.12 --> 02:08:30.12
I just a guy though on.

2875
02:08:30.12 --> 02:08:31.12
That's what I'm going to get.

2876
02:08:31.12 --> 02:08:32.12
I think he goes and cat.

2877
02:08:32.12 --> 02:08:33.12
Yeah.

2878
02:08:33.12 --> 02:08:35.12
I think he's named Mad Matt on Instagram.

2879
02:08:35.12 --> 02:08:37.12
He's a double blow knee.

2880
02:08:37.12 --> 02:08:39.12
I believe he's American Army.

2881
02:08:39.12 --> 02:08:40.12
Anyway, he jumps rope.

2882
02:08:40.12 --> 02:08:43.12
But he has like some prosthetic I haven't seen before.

2883
02:08:43.12 --> 02:08:45.12
So I'm going to try and get my hands on some of those.

2884
02:08:45.12 --> 02:08:46.12
I like it.

2885
02:08:46.12 --> 02:08:47.12
Jump rope is awesome.

2886
02:08:47.12 --> 02:08:48.12
Yeah.

2887
02:08:48.12 --> 02:08:49.12
Unless you get them at on it.

2888
02:08:49.12 --> 02:08:50.12
Dot comp slash.

2889
02:08:50.12 --> 02:08:51.12
We got some books.

2890
02:08:51.12 --> 02:08:53.12
Jodys got two books.

2891
02:08:53.12 --> 02:08:55.12
The first book, which I covered on podcast 24.

2892
02:08:55.12 --> 02:08:57.12
It's called Unflinching.

2893
02:08:57.12 --> 02:08:58.12
You can read.

2894
02:08:58.12 --> 02:08:59.12
You should definitely read it.

2895
02:08:59.12 --> 02:09:00.12
It's an awesome book.

2896
02:09:00.12 --> 02:09:01.12
Thanks, man.

2897
02:09:01.12 --> 02:09:02.12
Yeah.

2898
02:09:02.12 --> 02:09:06.12
It shows the pat, the journey that Jodys been on and now you know the rest of the journey.

2899
02:09:06.12 --> 02:09:08.12
You can hear the rest of the journey.

2900
02:09:08.12 --> 02:09:11.12
And he also wrote another book called Everyday Heroes.

2901
02:09:11.12 --> 02:09:12.12
Yeah.

2902
02:09:12.12 --> 02:09:13.12
Which is.

2903
02:09:13.12 --> 02:09:14.12
So that's about.

2904
02:09:14.12 --> 02:09:20.12
I've because in Canada, the military book genre is not as well received, let's say.

2905
02:09:20.12 --> 02:09:24.12
So my publisher realized there was an audience with my book at the best seller list.

2906
02:09:24.12 --> 02:09:26.12
In Canada, though.

2907
02:09:26.12 --> 02:09:29.12
I mean, there's less people in Canada, all of Canada than there in California.

2908
02:09:29.12 --> 02:09:33.12
So it's like, my kids aren't going to Ivy League schools or anything.

2909
02:09:33.12 --> 02:09:39.12
But so they want, so I wanted to do a book that would let other soldiers tell their story.

2910
02:09:39.12 --> 02:09:41.12
And I'm hoping to make a series out of it.

2911
02:09:41.12 --> 02:09:46.12
Like it's a book that I think I could do every year and never run out of material.

2912
02:09:46.12 --> 02:09:48.12
So pick it up.

2913
02:09:48.12 --> 02:09:51.12
Every day heroes, it's available every Amazon and anywhere.

2914
02:09:51.12 --> 02:09:55.12
But some good old boys from World War II in Korea right up to Afghanistan.

2915
02:09:55.12 --> 02:09:58.12
One of my favorite stories is this guy Bruno.

2916
02:09:58.12 --> 02:10:03.12
He disarms a suicide bomber while the guy has his fingers on the trigger.

2917
02:10:03.12 --> 02:10:04.12
Yeah.

2918
02:10:04.12 --> 02:10:06.12
The bot like balls, the size of like kettlebells.

2919
02:10:06.12 --> 02:10:07.12
Yeah.

2920
02:10:07.12 --> 02:10:09.12
Like so anyway, and he's a pretty good cool duties.

2921
02:10:09.12 --> 02:10:12.12
He's out there somewhere doing the good fight.

2922
02:10:12.12 --> 02:10:14.12
But that's awesome.

2923
02:10:14.12 --> 02:10:15.12
Yeah.

2924
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:16.12
So pick those books up.

2925
02:10:16.12 --> 02:10:18.12
You can also get Mikey in the dragons.

2926
02:10:18.12 --> 02:10:20.12
Best children's book.

2927
02:10:20.12 --> 02:10:22.12
In the world.

2928
02:10:22.12 --> 02:10:23.12
Yeah.

2929
02:10:23.12 --> 02:10:24.12
Mikey in the dragons.

2930
02:10:24.12 --> 02:10:25.12
Well, you know.

2931
02:10:25.12 --> 02:10:26.12
Mikey in the dragons.

2932
02:10:26.12 --> 02:10:27.12
You can pick that one up.

2933
02:10:27.12 --> 02:10:28.12
You can pick up way of the warrior kid.

2934
02:10:28.12 --> 02:10:31.12
Way of the warrior kid too, which is called Mark's mission.

2935
02:10:31.12 --> 02:10:32.12
Jody.

2936
02:10:32.12 --> 02:10:34.12
How does your daughter like weigh the warrior kid?

2937
02:10:34.12 --> 02:10:38.12
Uh, in her words, it's the greatest book she's ever read.

2938
02:10:38.12 --> 02:10:39.12
And she's 10.

2939
02:10:39.12 --> 02:10:40.12
Yeah.

2940
02:10:40.12 --> 02:10:43.12
And she's a girl and she's Canadian and she's my daughter.

2941
02:10:43.12 --> 02:10:44.12
And I can't get her to do.

2942
02:10:44.12 --> 02:10:46.12
Like even jits who's an argument.

2943
02:10:46.12 --> 02:10:48.12
I'm like you're doing jits who and I start.

2944
02:10:48.12 --> 02:10:49.12
She's like no, I don't want to.

2945
02:10:49.12 --> 02:10:52.12
But for some reason, that book and it's out on her shell for a couple months.

2946
02:10:52.12 --> 02:10:53.12
Yep.

2947
02:10:53.12 --> 02:10:57.12
But man, when she read it, she said, this is, I didn't, she didn't tell me she's reading it.

2948
02:10:57.12 --> 02:10:59.12
But she said, your friend wrote the greatest book I've ever read.

2949
02:10:59.12 --> 02:11:02.12
Did you book her pour it on it for school and every time?

2950
02:11:02.12 --> 02:11:03.12
That is awesome.

2951
02:11:03.12 --> 02:11:04.12
Yeah.

2952
02:11:04.12 --> 02:11:05.12
I think it's one of those things.

2953
02:11:05.12 --> 02:11:06.12
You don't want to force your kid to read it.

2954
02:11:06.12 --> 02:11:07.12
You just put it there.

2955
02:11:07.12 --> 02:11:09.12
You just kind of put it out there and let them read it.

2956
02:11:09.12 --> 02:11:10.12
Just like any leadership position.

2957
02:11:10.12 --> 02:11:12.12
You don't want to force things down someone's throat.

2958
02:11:12.12 --> 02:11:14.12
You just make available to them.

2959
02:11:14.12 --> 02:11:15.12
The path.

2960
02:11:15.12 --> 02:11:16.12
They'll see it.

2961
02:11:16.12 --> 02:11:17.12
They get on it.

2962
02:11:17.12 --> 02:11:21.12
And there's going to be a new or your kid book coming out in the spring.

2963
02:11:21.12 --> 02:11:25.12
I'll let you know when it's available for pre-order.

2964
02:11:25.12 --> 02:11:27.12
The big pre-order.

2965
02:11:27.12 --> 02:11:28.12
The name of that.

2966
02:11:28.12 --> 02:11:30.12
The subtitle of that book is where there's a will.

2967
02:11:30.12 --> 02:11:31.12
So you got that one coming.

2968
02:11:31.12 --> 02:11:33.12
You got the discipline because freedom field manual.

2969
02:11:33.12 --> 02:11:37.12
If you need to, it's another little reminder for life.

2970
02:11:37.12 --> 02:11:38.12
It's another thing that'll keep you on the path.

2971
02:11:38.12 --> 02:11:39.12
It keeps me on the path.

2972
02:11:39.12 --> 02:11:45.12
Just have that book sitting on one of my friends that is at a hedge fund.

2973
02:11:45.12 --> 02:11:49.12
And there, you know what's like a really cool looking hedge funds.

2974
02:11:49.12 --> 02:11:51.12
They're New York City.

2975
02:11:51.12 --> 02:11:52.12
All cool.

2976
02:11:52.12 --> 02:11:53.12
All well for walls.

2977
02:11:53.12 --> 02:11:54.12
What does that stuff?

2978
02:11:54.12 --> 02:11:55.12
What's the, yeah, sleek.

2979
02:11:55.12 --> 02:11:56.12
That's a modern thing.

2980
02:11:56.12 --> 02:11:57.12
They're very sleek.

2981
02:11:57.12 --> 02:11:59.12
And he shows me a picture of like they're,

2982
02:11:59.12 --> 02:12:02.12
they're, when you walk in and when you walk into a hedge fund,

2983
02:12:02.12 --> 02:12:05.12
you want to, they want to leave an impression that they know what's up.

2984
02:12:05.12 --> 02:12:08.12
There's a, there's this big white table.

2985
02:12:08.12 --> 02:12:10.12
What's on the white table?

2986
02:12:10.12 --> 02:12:11.12
The field.

2987
02:12:11.12 --> 02:12:12.12
The field bed.

2988
02:12:12.12 --> 02:12:13.12
One book.

2989
02:12:13.12 --> 02:12:15.12
Just sitting there.

2990
02:12:15.12 --> 02:12:17.12
And he says, everyone that comes in picks it up and goes,

2991
02:12:17.12 --> 02:12:18.12
What is this thing?

2992
02:12:18.12 --> 02:12:19.12
This is awesome.

2993
02:12:19.12 --> 02:12:22.12
So, it's perfect to be the only book to aesthetically.

2994
02:12:22.12 --> 02:12:23.12
It seems to be in a specific way,

2995
02:12:23.12 --> 02:12:25.12
it's a white table or black goes with everything.

2996
02:12:25.12 --> 02:12:26.12
Or a great table.

2997
02:12:26.12 --> 02:12:27.12
Yeah.

2998
02:12:27.12 --> 02:12:28.12
It goes with everything.

2999
02:12:28.12 --> 02:12:29.12
It's very nice.

3000
02:12:29.12 --> 02:12:34.12
So, get that book for yourself for anyone that wants to get after it more.

3001
02:12:34.12 --> 02:12:36.12
Or continually.

3002
02:12:36.12 --> 02:12:37.12
Extreme ownership.

3003
02:12:37.12 --> 02:12:39.12
We talked about that a bit today.

3004
02:12:39.12 --> 02:12:42.12
The lessons we learned in combat and how you can apply them.

3005
02:12:42.12 --> 02:12:45.12
To your business, to your team, to your family, to your life.

3006
02:12:45.12 --> 02:12:51.12
Also the dichotomy leadership, which is now starting to creep out from its older brothers, shadow.

3007
02:12:51.12 --> 02:12:54.12
Because extreme ownership, everyone knows that everyone loves it.

3008
02:12:54.12 --> 02:12:57.12
But they're like, Oh, dichotomy, oh, we don't know about your little brother.

3009
02:12:57.12 --> 02:12:59.12
It's kind of like you, Echo.

3010
02:12:59.12 --> 02:13:01.12
You're a James Little brother.

3011
02:13:01.12 --> 02:13:02.12
Yep, sure.

3012
02:13:02.12 --> 02:13:04.12
And you know, it was kind of like, oh, Jade was kind of like,

3013
02:13:04.12 --> 02:13:07.12
I'm like, I'm like, I don't know, came first.

3014
02:13:07.12 --> 02:13:08.12
Came first.

3015
02:13:08.12 --> 02:13:09.12
Came first.

3016
02:13:09.12 --> 02:13:10.12
You're just the echo.

3017
02:13:10.12 --> 02:13:11.12
Right?

3018
02:13:11.12 --> 02:13:16.12
Oh, and Jade was bigger than you, right?

3019
02:13:16.12 --> 02:13:17.12
Yeah, he was.

3020
02:13:17.12 --> 02:13:18.12
You hear the echo?

3021
02:13:18.12 --> 02:13:19.12
You see, I'm saying.

3022
02:13:19.12 --> 02:13:23.12
So dichotomy leadership is like the echo Charles of the Jade Charles.

3023
02:13:23.12 --> 02:13:24.12
Oh, family.

3024
02:13:24.12 --> 02:13:27.12
Oh, you're just funny about that on that thread.

3025
02:13:27.12 --> 02:13:32.12
Like, before my jodimetic podcast episode one, when we were coming to meet you,

3026
02:13:32.12 --> 02:13:35.12
we had to come and we debated, Luke and I debated if echo,

3027
02:13:35.12 --> 02:13:40.12
like I say, I can't wait to find out what echo Charles is real name is.

3028
02:13:40.12 --> 02:13:43.12
And Luke says, I hope it's echo Charles.

3029
02:13:43.12 --> 02:13:44.12
Yeah.

3030
02:13:44.12 --> 02:13:46.12
Because I just thought it was, remember we talked about this.

3031
02:13:46.12 --> 02:13:46.12
Yeah.

3032
02:13:46.12 --> 02:13:48.12
I'll figure out what Charlie, right?

3033
02:13:48.12 --> 02:13:51.12
And then when I asked you, you're like, no, my name is echo.

3034
02:13:51.12 --> 02:13:54.12
And what's Charles mean, you're like, it's my last name.

3035
02:13:54.12 --> 02:13:55.12
It's, it's less name.

3036
02:13:55.12 --> 02:13:57.12
I just just re-listened into the shows.

3037
02:13:57.12 --> 02:13:58.12
I can show you the other day.

3038
02:13:58.12 --> 02:14:01.12
And I was like, oh, yeah, can we talk to Echo about like,

3039
02:14:01.12 --> 02:14:03.12
how I thought for sure your real name was like,

3040
02:14:03.12 --> 02:14:05.12
was like, like, Ernie or something.

3041
02:14:05.12 --> 02:14:07.12
He called you Echo because it's cooler.

3042
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:08.12
Yeah.

3043
02:14:08.12 --> 02:14:09.12
It starts with an E.

3044
02:14:09.12 --> 02:14:10.12
We didn't want no Ernie.

3045
02:14:10.12 --> 02:14:11.12
Oh, the podcast here.

3046
02:14:11.12 --> 02:14:13.12
Well, kind of like how you did with the excuse of bruiser.

3047
02:14:13.12 --> 02:14:14.12
You did that.

3048
02:14:14.12 --> 02:14:15.12
Is that thing?

3049
02:14:15.12 --> 02:14:17.12
And maybe if your name was like, Ernie,

3050
02:14:17.12 --> 02:14:18.12
I wouldn't have the change.

3051
02:14:18.12 --> 02:14:20.12
I just said Ernie, it's echo.

3052
02:14:20.12 --> 02:14:21.12
That would just sounds cooler.

3053
02:14:21.12 --> 02:14:23.12
And then Charles was like, because like,

3054
02:14:23.12 --> 02:14:25.12
maybe your real name was Charlie or something.

3055
02:14:25.12 --> 02:14:26.12
I don't know.

3056
02:14:26.12 --> 02:14:27.12
Yeah.

3057
02:14:27.12 --> 02:14:28.12
I dig it.

3058
02:14:28.12 --> 02:14:29.12
Well, with these books, good news.

3059
02:14:29.12 --> 02:14:30.12
By the way, books, speaking of books.

3060
02:14:30.12 --> 02:14:31.12
Yeah.

3061
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:33.12
All these, you can, you can get every day heroes.

3062
02:14:33.12 --> 02:14:35.12
All these books on jocopadguest.com.

3063
02:14:35.12 --> 02:14:36.12
Yeah.

3064
02:14:36.12 --> 02:14:37.12
I got them organized.

3065
02:14:37.12 --> 02:14:38.12
There's a list of books.

3066
02:14:38.12 --> 02:14:39.12
All of them.

3067
02:14:39.12 --> 02:14:42.12
And you can get the dichotomy of leadership there as well.

3068
02:14:42.12 --> 02:14:43.12
And extreme. All these books.

3069
02:14:43.12 --> 02:14:44.12
Yeah.

3070
02:14:44.12 --> 02:14:45.12
I got them listed on a page.

3071
02:14:45.12 --> 02:14:46.12
Every book we've covered.

3072
02:14:46.12 --> 02:14:48.12
You haven't got every day heroes on there.

3073
02:14:48.12 --> 02:14:49.12
You do now.

3074
02:14:49.12 --> 02:14:50.12
No, I think I did for that.

3075
02:14:50.12 --> 02:14:51.12
Oh, okay.

3076
02:14:51.12 --> 02:14:53.12
My words on your website.

3077
02:14:53.12 --> 02:14:55.12
I think for real.

3078
02:14:55.12 --> 02:14:56.12
You'll be original one of them.

3079
02:14:56.12 --> 02:14:57.12
Yeah.

3080
02:14:57.12 --> 02:14:58.12
Unfuncing is for sure.

3081
02:14:58.12 --> 02:14:59.12
It is.

3082
02:14:59.12 --> 02:14:59.12
Yeah.

3083
02:14:59.12 --> 02:15:00.12
Oh, thanks, man.

3084
02:15:00.12 --> 02:15:01.12
I don't realize that.

3085
02:15:01.12 --> 02:15:03.12
Every book that we've done is on is on.

3086
02:15:03.12 --> 02:15:04.12
Thanks, jocopadguest.

3087
02:15:04.12 --> 02:15:05.12
I should have known.

3088
02:15:05.12 --> 02:15:06.12
I have a song too.

3089
02:15:06.12 --> 02:15:08.12
That's probably why it's still selling.

3090
02:15:08.12 --> 02:15:09.12
It's still selling.

3091
02:15:09.12 --> 02:15:10.12
It's still selling.

3092
02:15:10.12 --> 02:15:11.12
That's what I mean.

3093
02:15:11.12 --> 02:15:15.12
Well, the weird thing you got to remember is that the lag time on the podcast is there's

3094
02:15:15.12 --> 02:15:20.12
there's there's there's many many people that start with episode one today.

3095
02:15:20.12 --> 02:15:21.12
No, bro.

3096
02:15:21.12 --> 02:15:22.12
That's what I said.

3097
02:15:22.12 --> 02:15:25.12
I say I get a message like weekly minimum one a week.

3098
02:15:25.12 --> 02:15:27.12
It's I just heard you on jocco.

3099
02:15:27.12 --> 02:15:27.12
Yeah.

3100
02:15:27.12 --> 02:15:30.12
And then I go like I resist the urge to say, oh,

3101
02:15:30.12 --> 02:15:33.12
if you heard me on episode was it 2014 or

3102
02:15:33.12 --> 02:15:36.12
you're going to say, yeah, 2525.

3103
02:15:36.12 --> 02:15:41.12
Wait till 11 11 or and then you know, because I want them to discover it on their own.

3104
02:15:41.12 --> 02:15:41.12
Yeah.

3105
02:15:41.12 --> 02:15:41.12
Yeah.

3106
02:15:41.12 --> 02:15:47.12
No, that's one of the coolest things is people and people ask me where should I start on the podcast and I say one.

3107
02:15:47.12 --> 02:15:52.12
And they definitely build on each other, but they're also timeless.

3108
02:15:52.12 --> 02:15:58.12
So it's not like you go, oh, well, they're talking about some political thing that happened in 2014 and I don't want to listen to that right now.

3109
02:15:58.12 --> 02:16:02.12
No, it's like we're talking about something that happened 480 years ago.

3110
02:16:02.12 --> 02:16:04.12
And you do want to hear about it.

3111
02:16:04.12 --> 02:16:04.12
Yeah.

3112
02:16:04.12 --> 02:16:09.12
So yeah, but I saw the economy leadership someone the other day had had wrote on Twitter.

3113
02:16:09.12 --> 02:16:14.12
This is the best leadership book I've ever read, which is normally what I hear about extreme ownership.

3114
02:16:14.12 --> 02:16:17.12
So now I see a little little replacement there.

3115
02:16:17.12 --> 02:16:21.12
Jade Charles is being you served by his younger brother.

3116
02:16:21.12 --> 02:16:23.12
That's what's going on.

3117
02:16:23.12 --> 02:16:27.12
So Jade better start to keep rooting for extreme ownership year.

3118
02:16:27.12 --> 02:16:29.12
You represent the decademy of leadership.

3119
02:16:29.12 --> 02:16:32.12
We got to have some on front leadership consultancy.

3120
02:16:32.12 --> 02:16:35.12
What we do is we solve problems through leadership.

3121
02:16:35.12 --> 02:16:38.12
It's me, Dave Babin, JP, and all day Burke.

3122
02:16:38.12 --> 02:16:41.12
Flynn Cochran, Mike's your rally, Mike Bima.

3123
02:16:41.12 --> 02:16:45.12
And Jason Gardner, someone put up like,

3124
02:16:45.12 --> 02:16:49.12
Dang, everyone at this company is a pipe editor.

3125
02:16:49.12 --> 02:16:50.12
No one can compete.

3126
02:16:50.12 --> 02:16:56.12
I was like, hmm, I'm not going to say no one can compete, but we definitely have awesome guys on the team.

3127
02:16:56.12 --> 02:16:59.12
That's echelon front dot com for details there.

3128
02:16:59.12 --> 02:17:06.12
We got the master coming in 2019, May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th, 20th and Denver, December 4th and 5th.

3129
02:17:06.12 --> 02:17:08.12
In Sydney, Australia.

3130
02:17:08.12 --> 02:17:10.12
That's right.

3131
02:17:10.12 --> 02:17:13.12
Go to extreme ownership dot com.

3132
02:17:13.12 --> 02:17:15.12
Everyone of these events is sold out.

3133
02:17:15.12 --> 02:17:18.12
And all of these are going to sell out.

3134
02:17:18.12 --> 02:17:21.12
They're actually selling faster than they've ever sold before.

3135
02:17:21.12 --> 02:17:23.12
When we look at our data analytics.

3136
02:17:23.12 --> 02:17:26.12
The made it data.

3137
02:17:26.12 --> 02:17:28.12
Yeah, I think it's met up.

3138
02:17:28.12 --> 02:17:30.12
No, we're going to say, wait a minute.

3139
02:17:30.12 --> 02:17:32.12
We made it data.

3140
02:17:32.12 --> 02:17:33.12
How do you guys call it?

3141
02:17:33.12 --> 02:17:35.12
We're going to Canadian.

3142
02:17:35.12 --> 02:17:36.12
Yeah, after this.

3143
02:17:36.12 --> 02:17:38.12
Yeah, the Canadian dates.

3144
02:17:38.12 --> 02:17:39.12
Yeah, yeah, phone line.

3145
02:17:39.12 --> 02:17:43.12
One of the reasons that we did this is because not everyone can come to the master.

3146
02:17:43.12 --> 02:17:45.12
And every time I post about the master,

3147
02:17:45.12 --> 02:17:47.12
there's someone that says, when do you come into Milwaukee,

3148
02:17:47.12 --> 02:17:50.12
when do you come into Detroit, when do you come into Ottawa,

3149
02:17:50.12 --> 02:17:53.12
when do you come into the water?

3150
02:17:53.12 --> 02:17:55.12
And the bottom lines we can't go everywhere to do monsters.

3151
02:17:55.12 --> 02:17:58.12
That was one of the things that made us make this thing.

3152
02:17:58.12 --> 02:17:58.12
EF online.

3153
02:17:58.12 --> 02:18:04.12
The other reason is we work with companies that have tens or hundreds of thousands of employees.

3154
02:18:04.12 --> 02:18:07.12
And they say, oh, can you just train all of it employees?

3155
02:18:07.12 --> 02:18:08.12
And I say, well, yeah, sure.

3156
02:18:08.12 --> 02:18:11.12
And then they say, I have 138,000 employees.

3157
02:18:11.12 --> 02:18:13.12
No, actually, that's going to be a problem.

3158
02:18:13.12 --> 02:18:14.12
So how to solve that problem.

3159
02:18:14.12 --> 02:18:16.12
We made EF online.

3160
02:18:16.12 --> 02:18:19.12
It is interactive training online that you can take.

3161
02:18:19.12 --> 02:18:22.12
EF online.com.

3162
02:18:22.12 --> 02:18:24.12
We have also EF Overwatch.

3163
02:18:24.12 --> 02:18:32.12
If you want a combat proven special operations leader or combat aviation leader

3164
02:18:32.12 --> 02:18:37.12
to come and work inside your company to make things happen,

3165
02:18:37.12 --> 02:18:41.12
then go to EF Overwatch.com.

3166

3167
02:18:44.12 --> 02:18:49.12
talent, a talent, a secret that needs people that your company that can lead and

3168
02:18:49.12 --> 02:18:52.12

You off Facebook.

3173
02:19:09.12 --> 02:19:10.12
No, he's on Facebook.

3174
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:11.12
Echo is at Equitrails.

3175
02:19:11.12 --> 02:19:16.12
I am at Jocca, Willink, and Jodi is at Jodi, medic.

3176
02:19:16.12 --> 02:19:17.12
Echo, anything else?

3177
02:19:17.12 --> 02:19:18.12
I have nothing else.

3178
02:19:18.12 --> 02:19:19.12
Thank you.

3179
02:19:19.12 --> 02:19:21.12
Thank you for having nothing else.

3180
02:19:21.12 --> 02:19:24.12
See you, man.

3181
02:19:24.12 --> 02:19:25.12
Thank you.

3182
02:19:25.12 --> 02:19:26.12
It's good.

3183
02:19:26.12 --> 02:19:28.12
Jodi, anything else, brother.

3184
02:19:28.12 --> 02:19:29.12
Thank you, Jocca.

3185
02:19:29.12 --> 02:19:30.12
Thank you, Echo.

3186
02:19:30.12 --> 02:19:31.12
Thank you to the listeners.

3187
02:19:31.12 --> 02:19:36.12
And, you know, I'm working on being the best Jodi I can be.

3188
02:19:36.12 --> 02:19:39.12
And thanks for being there with For Me and with Kelly and I.

3189
02:19:39.12 --> 02:19:41.12
It's good that you have like a new mission.

3190
02:19:41.12 --> 02:19:44.12
Remember, you know, that was one of the best ways I've ever heard it.

3191
02:19:44.12 --> 02:19:47.12
Put like you need a mission.

3192
02:19:47.12 --> 02:19:50.12
So, man, if you don't have like an important mission, like,

3193
02:19:50.12 --> 02:19:53.12
you really care that, I mean, sure, I got, I know what I got to do tomorrow

3194
02:19:53.12 --> 02:19:54.12
and the next month and all.

3195
02:19:54.12 --> 02:19:56.12
But if it's not like that important to you,

3196
02:19:56.12 --> 02:19:59.12
but you're going to be like, all right, I need to tell you what happened, bro.

3197
02:19:59.12 --> 02:20:04.12
Right, the politics getting in the politics winning was a great mission.

3198
02:20:04.12 --> 02:20:05.12
Yeah.

3199
02:20:05.12 --> 02:20:06.12
And then I won.

3200
02:20:06.12 --> 02:20:08.12
And then I was like the dog that caught the car.

3201
02:20:08.12 --> 02:20:09.12
Yeah.

3202
02:20:09.12 --> 02:20:11.12
I was like, okay, what do I do now?

3203
02:20:11.12 --> 02:20:15.12
And I tried to learn and I, you know, I had the deputy mayor and the mayor

3204
02:20:15.12 --> 02:20:19.12
and they were all on my side and I had lots of like they all, we still talk,

3205
02:20:19.12 --> 02:20:21.12
but they could say they could see it.

3206
02:20:21.12 --> 02:20:23.12
My heart just wasn't in it, you know?

3207
02:20:23.12 --> 02:20:25.12
And like Kelly would always say she would always say, man,

3208
02:20:25.12 --> 02:20:29.12
you know, when you get excited and you talk about like going here to see the troops

3209
02:20:29.12 --> 02:20:32.12
or going there and shooting and going there and like planning up that business,

3210
02:20:32.12 --> 02:20:35.12
you've, I've owned open a gym since before I got blown up.

3211
02:20:35.12 --> 02:20:38.12
You know, and now I'm back on and I thought I could do both.

3212
02:20:38.12 --> 02:20:43.12
I thought being the counselor would let me like, you know, have a spot, open it,

3213
02:20:43.12 --> 02:20:46.12
like be there for meetings, but it's just, it's not just the work.

3214
02:20:46.12 --> 02:20:52.12
Not for me anyway, maybe if I go like, like, I might get political again in my 50s

3215
02:20:52.12 --> 02:20:56.12
after I make a few bucks and it's a little less more to pay the bills.

3216
02:20:56.12 --> 02:21:00.12
And so it's a little less to about paying the bills and more about getting things done.

3217
02:21:00.12 --> 02:21:01.12
So I make sense?

3218
02:21:01.12 --> 02:21:02.12
Yeah.

3219
02:21:02.12 --> 02:21:05.12
So we, you know, but right now I need to be myself for a while.

3220
02:21:05.12 --> 02:21:06.12
And so that's it.

3221
02:21:06.12 --> 02:21:08.12
But I tend your plan is to be Jody.

3222
02:21:08.12 --> 02:21:09.12
Don't check.

3223
02:21:09.12 --> 02:21:13.12
And as Echo said, that's a new mission, the new mission with the place that you're developing.

3224
02:21:13.12 --> 02:21:14.12
And you know, I'm talking, I'm talking.

3225
02:21:14.12 --> 02:21:19.12
I'm plugging for as long as I didn't realize how much you're doing and bro, like the respect

3226
02:21:19.12 --> 02:21:21.12
I have for you actually just went up hearing that.

3227
02:21:21.12 --> 02:21:24.12
And it's not like I, it's not like I can go much higher.

3228
02:21:24.12 --> 02:21:26.12
Don't get too, you go to this to go to this.

3229
02:21:26.12 --> 02:21:28.12
But, you know, guy like me thinking you're awesome,

3230
02:21:28.12 --> 02:21:32.12
but my point is everything you're doing is for the community.

3231
02:21:32.12 --> 02:21:35.12
And I had a sit down actually shot show 2017.

3232
02:21:35.12 --> 02:21:40.12
One of the guys I taught on his basic sniper sat, he's one of the best snipers in Canada.

3233
02:21:40.12 --> 02:21:42.12
One of our soft commanders.

3234
02:21:42.12 --> 02:21:44.12
He said, you need to stop.

3235
02:21:44.12 --> 02:21:49.12
He was another guy who told me you can do more for the community as Jody medic and working for yourself.

3236
02:21:49.12 --> 02:21:54.12
Then for working for cult or demaco or any of these other companies that I was looking at.

3237
02:21:54.12 --> 02:22:02.12
And you know, and it's being able to take the reins of leadership that you have.

3238
02:22:02.12 --> 02:22:05.12
And start doing the things listening to you talk.

3239
02:22:05.12 --> 02:22:10.12
I'm like, because Kelly and I, like we have a five and ten year plan where we hope we can have an employment website.

3240
02:22:10.12 --> 02:22:17.12
Where we hope we can have a speaking bureau that can take guys of a similar mindset and have a presence and put them out.

3241
02:22:17.12 --> 02:22:19.12
They're delivering a good message.

3242
02:22:19.12 --> 02:22:23.12
And you're doing all that and you're being an example for my kids, dude.

3243
02:22:23.12 --> 02:22:27.12
And like, because then, and you know, it takes a village to raise a kid.

3244
02:22:27.12 --> 02:22:31.12
And I want my daughters to know all the best people in the world.

3245
02:22:31.12 --> 02:22:32.12
And you're one of them.

3246
02:22:32.12 --> 02:22:35.12
And you're just everything you're doing with the people around you.

3247
02:22:35.12 --> 02:22:41.12
Like, I'm, I have, I have someone that's leading the way for me.

3248
02:22:41.12 --> 02:22:45.12
And I'm glad it's not just me doing it either.

3249
02:22:45.12 --> 02:22:48.12
Is that makes, like, I'm way, I'm 10 years behind you.

3250
02:22:48.12 --> 02:22:50.12
But, but now I know it's possible, too.

3251
02:22:50.12 --> 02:22:53.12
Yeah, no, it's, there's, there's plenty of room.

3252
02:22:53.12 --> 02:22:58.12
There's all kinds of people in the world that are down to move forward and move on.

3253
02:22:58.12 --> 02:23:00.12
And there's a plenty of pie for everybody.

3254
02:23:00.12 --> 02:23:01.12
That's the version.

3255
02:23:01.12 --> 02:23:04.12
Right now in Canada, we're dealing with a little bit of like,

3256
02:23:04.12 --> 02:23:07.12
too much competition, not enough collaboration.

3257
02:23:07.12 --> 02:23:09.12
And as far as the tactical after Army world.

3258
02:23:09.12 --> 02:23:14.12
But, you know, and the reason I kept throwing an auto-awed Canada there is because

3259
02:23:14.12 --> 02:23:16.12
they're hungry for Jocco in Canada.

3260
02:23:16.12 --> 02:23:19.12
And we should talk because, and we have a little bit of a,

3261
02:23:19.12 --> 02:23:20.12
yeah, yeah, we have a little bit.

3262
02:23:20.12 --> 02:23:23.12
But, but I'm telling you, it's probably bigger than you realize.

3263
02:23:23.12 --> 02:23:25.12
Okay, so anyway, I just wanted to throw that in.

3264
02:23:25.12 --> 02:23:28.12
You said anything else and I just listened to you talk.

3265
02:23:28.12 --> 02:23:31.12
It gives me hope that everything I want to do is achievable.

3266
02:23:31.12 --> 02:23:36.12
There's no doubt about it, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm an average dude that I'm hard to work.

3267
02:23:36.12 --> 02:23:39.12
I will say that, but nothing special in any other way.

3268
02:23:39.12 --> 02:23:41.12
And I just, and you're good person after.

3269
02:23:41.12 --> 02:23:45.12
And, and, and good people attract good people and you, you know,

3270
02:23:45.12 --> 02:23:48.12
if you were hard to work with, people wouldn't work with you.

3271
02:23:48.12 --> 02:23:50.12
And that's one thing I've learned.

3272
02:23:50.12 --> 02:23:53.12
Like, you know, if you want good people around, you have to be a good person.

3273
02:23:53.12 --> 02:23:58.12
Yeah, no, it's, it's awesome to work with all the guys that I work with before.

3274
02:23:58.12 --> 02:24:01.12
And we're all working together again as actually with Jason Gardner.

3275
02:24:01.12 --> 02:24:04.12
We were just laughing because he got back from his gig.

3276
02:24:04.12 --> 02:24:07.12
I got back from my gig and he was just laughing and saying, this is so awesome.

3277
02:24:07.12 --> 02:24:08.12
Man, this is so awesome.

3278
02:24:08.12 --> 02:24:10.12
You're around all the people you were around in uniform.

3279
02:24:10.12 --> 02:24:12.12
Yeah, you can help each other again.

3280
02:24:12.12 --> 02:24:13.12
That's what it's all about, man.

3281
02:24:13.12 --> 02:24:14.12
Right, right.

3282
02:24:14.12 --> 02:24:15.12
It's what it's all about.

3283
02:24:15.12 --> 02:24:20.12
And speaking of those people in uniform that allow us to do this podcast,

3284
02:24:20.12 --> 02:24:24.12
people like you, Jodie, all of our military personnel.

3285
02:24:24.12 --> 02:24:27.12
And also, we're police and law enforcement and firefighters and

3286
02:24:27.12 --> 02:24:34.12
paramedics and EMTs and correction officers and border patrol and all the first responders that are out there in uniform.

3287
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:38.12
All of you allow us the freedom and security that we have in it.

3288
02:24:38.12 --> 02:24:42.12
We relish every single day that allow us these opportunities.

3289
02:24:42.12 --> 02:24:46.12
So thanks to every single one of you for providing it.

3290
02:24:46.12 --> 02:24:52.12
And to everyone else that is listening.

3291
02:24:52.12 --> 02:24:55.12
We talk about the path.

3292
02:24:55.12 --> 02:24:58.12
And we talk about discipline and we talk about living clean,

3293
02:24:58.12 --> 02:25:00.12
but it is not an easy path.

3294
02:25:00.12 --> 02:25:09.12
It is filled with temptations and pitfalls and hazards and traps.

3295
02:25:09.12 --> 02:25:12.12
And it's hard to stay on the path.

3296
02:25:12.12 --> 02:25:18.12
And if you fall off, it can seem even harder to get back on.

3297
02:25:18.12 --> 02:25:21.12
But you can do it.

3298
02:25:21.12 --> 02:25:23.12
You got to be honest with yourself.

3299
02:25:23.12 --> 02:25:26.12
Do not be a slave.

3300
02:25:26.12 --> 02:25:32.12
Don't be a slave to drugs or booze or emotion or whatever.

3301
02:25:32.12 --> 02:25:37.12
Weakness is trying to be your master.

3302
02:25:37.12 --> 02:25:40.12
Don't allow it.

3303
02:25:40.12 --> 02:25:42.12
Tell the truth.

3304
02:25:42.12 --> 02:25:45.12
Call out your own weaknesses.

3305
02:25:45.12 --> 02:26:00.12
Then impose discipline, impose your will and climb back up onto the path and set yourself free.

3306
02:26:00.12 --> 02:26:05.12
And until next time, this is Jody Mitic and echo and jockel.

3307
02:26:05.12 --> 02:26:08.12
Out.
