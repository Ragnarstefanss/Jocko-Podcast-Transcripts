so I just I look at this is like an understanding process do you understand this area do thank you I'm not even sure I understand so hack worth goes a wall because he wants to fight more back to the book any man who's wild enough to go a wall to fight is just a kind of man we want our outfit said captain John Paul van when I stopped at his eighth Ranger camp fresh from my breakfast out of the 25th Recon company the eighth Rangers was a great spirit at outfit recently rebuilt after being decimated the night the Chinese entered the war after I'd explain my situation the whole outfit accepted me with open arms the Rangers were elite troops four runners of the special forces their mission was raids long reconnaissance patrols ambushes and other special jobs that conventional troops were not trained to handle their history went back to Rogers Rangers before the Revolutionary War during World War II there've been six Ranger battalions whose brave and daring feats are unmatched to this day historically such all volunteer specific specially trained units had been misused task either with impossible missions for organizations their size or placed with palace guard combat duties well beneath their skill and ability when I arrived at the eighth Ranger camp the unit was chasing guerrillas behind the main lines morale was high and the guys were spoiling for a good fight but during the time I was there there was nothing much to my way of thinking anyway that seemed to be happening I was impatient to get in the thick of it and as proud as I was to be a Ranger guerrilla hunting was not my idea of infantry combat little did I know then the starring roles that guerrilla hunting and Ranger seal John Paul van would have later in my life besides the word was that the eighth Rangers was going to be broken up soon and something in me said to move on so I did until I saw a sign by a road that proclaimed wolf-hound right-white rear well if that's not a guarantee for a good fight I don't know what is I thought and high-tailed it to the battalion CP the 27th Infantry Wolf-Hound Regiment was a colorful unit itself the outfit had gotten his name during a stint in fighting the communist in Siberia during the Russian Revolution and Korea the wolf-hounds were known as the fire brigade because whenever there was trouble they were sent into save the day they weren't a special unit just a group of guys who thought they were good so they were good I had to highlight that because I just teaches you something about leadership and about morale and about attitude and about a speed of core you get guys and you convince them that they're good and they think they're good they get good they become good I'd see members of the outfit regularly over the last months whenever the 25th Recon had sent their portions of the division was sent I've been sent their portion of the divisional front but it's a good thing this renegade kind of soldering was not only sanctioned but encouraged by the twenty-seven's regimental commander and fire chief world war two paratrooper Colonel John iron-micolus Michaelus who would go on to four stars understood what made men fight he was known from morale boosting slogans like your lean your mean your rough your tough your professional killers and pre-battle pep talks like you're not here to die for your country you're here to make those other so-and-so is die for theirs the wolf hounds prad proud combat record showed that they believed him and they'd eagerly adopted their commanders no nonsense brand of soldering i was more than ready to do the same the second battalion's exo pointed the way up the road to where the rifle companies were deployed the first unit i came to is company g where i reported to first sergeant Edwin rager i can always use another sergeant this giant of a top kick roard then and there he assigned me to third puttune finally with the assurance that i'd be picked up on the morning report so i wouldn't be considered a walther a or mma i joined my new family at first it was not the happiest of unions i should have realized it wouldn't be easy it's always a bitch to join a unit particularly one as tight as the wolf hounds as an individual replacement and for some reason it's even worse when you're an nco or an officer you don't know anyone and no one trusts you until you've proved yourself in battle you get all the lousy details and only the worst battlefield horror stories you're just the new guy you're just fresh meat and add insult to injury though i'd been a squad leader in acting platoon sergeant in in Italy and a sex and leader in the 25th recon now in the in the third of the g i found myself an assistant squad leader i was damned unhappy with the emotion i probably had more non-com experience than any of the squad leaders in the platoon but the fact was that in their eyes i was untried and all protests the contrary fell on deaf ears doesn't matter who you are hack worth checking into a new unit got to prove yourself it didn't help i didn't help my cause that any that evening soon after my arrival when just at dusk i got caught in a right in a rice paddy right smack dab in the middle of a blistering chink mortar attack i started to run but slipped and fell in the patty when i finally got back to my foxhole i discovered that my water repellent outer trousers were covered with human shit which the Koreans used for fertilizer on surprisingly the guy sharing my whole was unhappy about this as i was i took off the trousers and made due for the night with two pairs of long johns and two pairs of OD trousers i had on an underneath then i sat out until it was my turn to go on guard leaving my foxhole partner to contend with the lingering aroma of my accident guard was grew a grueling ritual mainly because everyone was so tired each squad had its own sector normally four foxholes each about four yards apart the two guys shared a hole and took turns throughout the night searching into the darkness you'd look until you got tired then glance at your buddy sacked out at the bottom of the hole then you'd look a little longer until while you thought should i wake him now has he had enough sleep few guys had a watch us to own a watch in an infantry squad during the first Korean winter was a luxury beyond imagination it's like because where you're at it's a place in your mind too you know how like even if you're you're making progress but you're used to not making progress you know when you're really used to it can happen like with like if you have like a certain amount of money in your bank account your a kid or young man whatever if you're used to having like you know 20 dollars in there yes exactly right that's a good way to develop a pattern is you just automatically assume and do it every day just automatically as part of the day you know not like all I want to try to get a workout into it you know it's not that it's like that's like that's it's more of a given you know kind of thing is a weird thing that I'll say to people like how do you sure or you know like every day it's just all that's sort of just what you do every single day it's like right it becomes that you know and boom you're a new person boom just like that just like that you know like we're all in the path we're working out every day hey look you joins get sore you know it's like you know I actually read once four years ago in a muscle and fitness magazine that you know five days in a row is a bit too much to work out you should take that whatever day off you always can find 80 million ways to rationalize it's not the Bulgarians actually on their periodization cycle they only took you know like there's a million different I was reading about Michael Phelps and even though he trained hard there was always one day a week that he would just rest like everyone's got a million different rationalizing things that you can put in your head and I mean really to think like I can't have ice cream on the suffering well in your kind of addiction I'm assuming you know like I've the only addiction I've really dealt with as far as like seeing people as like a cigarette scenario where they're like craving a cigarette so much I mean there's certain levels of suffering for sure like you can go deep into human suffering for sure but really to some people like not having a drink the suffering you know when they're like or have a craving for ice cream or something like this it's like it's and it's like man if you can just imagine kind of what Jocca would say right now you know because you could legitimately have a tweaking your knee you could and then varying levels it could be like almost like hey if you start doing this squat routine that you have planned like you we will make it work for sure you know Well could they be interpreted as organized you know like you know the kind where those two guys let's say not military maybe like I don't know your friends in the neighborhood and you don't like them you know. yeah mentally man that's a big deal mentally where that's part of like essentially like your life you know it's part of like who you are you know like that's the discipline but I was too weak to tired too cold to get the words out the jeep spun around and headed back up that fire swept road pass Colonel Merch right into the jaws the whole god damn communist army we stopped the medics calmly sontored out to pick up the other casualty they took all the time in the world or so it seemed while the enemy used the large red cross markings on the Jeep for target practice the jeep's canvas size were sides were being ventilated the slugs were passing above and below my litter I felt totally helpless and score that whoever the wounded guy was I would hate him for life which from the way things were going was not going to be long it turned out he was a buddy through the Hawaiian mafia connection a handsome six footer named Ray Mendez I almost kept my kept to my word though when I found out his critical wound to be a slug in the thigh when he'd been hit he'd rolled up in a ball blooded squirted out of his leg all over the front of his jacket and someone had concluded that he had taken it in the gut oblivious to the fight raging on all signs of our thin skin ambulance jeep Mendez became chirpier and chirpier as we headed out of the battle area he sang praises of his million dollar wound and spun dreams about his in imminent return to the islands me one big war hero bra he said the regimental collection collecting station was jammed with casualties the surgeon who bent over my litter was covered with blood like a butcher we're going to bypass division clearing and send you straight to mash at Sioux want he said you're on your way home the next stop was quick mash was near the emergency runway at Sioux want the dock there wrote on my wounded leg and you know like i was i always tell people when you when you go on the steel teams your first platoon leaves a big mark on you and definitely your first two platoon and the teams have become a lot more similar than they used to be all the different steel teams there are a lot more similar than they used to be they used to be they used to have much more of their own personalities team one the nickname for team one which is where i was was stallog team one because it was you know you had uniforms and inspections and you had you everyone had short hair and they inspected your hair cuts and all the stuff team five was kind of you know they were kind of wild kind of just do you know they had no inspections it seems like it being a new guy as hard being a new guy is very hard you cannot you cannot do these kind of things socks when you do everyone's watching you you know kind of when you're a new guy kind of kind of back off a little bit you know what i'm saying you like just take take a wrap off so what's another dead body it's almost as if you don't care in this case we just leaned forward kept walking and tried to ignore the song in our heads the ones the troops called the bug out blues so this is the life of a ground pounder at often think the risks were higher in the recon company but life in George was far more harsh at least in recon we frequently rode on the backs of our tanks in thus kept warm in the infantry it was just a plotting grind one foot after the other until the column stopped and we'd flopped down the sound sound asleep before our heads touched the ground in recon we were seldom hungry because we stashed rations on the tanks in the infantry growling bellies were our constant companions in the infantry many men lost their will to live frequently guys would just quit drop out of the moving column and plunk down on the side of the road sometimes with the Chinese within sight you'd say come on buddy get up let's go you're going to be captured and he'd say I don't care I can't go another step a day felt like a week and the more tired and infantry became the the more tired and infantry man became the more he wanted to lighten his load first would go the souvenirs then his extra ammo next would be the bulky gear the field coat the pile jackets and the down sleeping bags even though he'd new heat freeze that night in the infantry I found you live for right now you don't give a damn about tomorrow because you don't even know if there'll be one getting it's weird but they were also sort of they seemed like shy for lack of a better one like team three was just kind of like they were just doing over there doing their thing they were also disconnected because they were deploying to south west Asia back then and team one and team two were deploying to south east areas so they were a little bit disconnected which made them seem a little bit more shy i guess i don't know that's the right word you're almost kind of used to like the warmth that you can imagine you know and to have that warmth kind of just taking away meaning you got to shift your plan back to like the reality whatever man that can see all that could be hard he's even got the fantasy of like hey the war vet for sure but what I do or sometimes if I have the strength uh is all imagine like you know how like all come with you with an issue like a work that's in excuse or something and you always have some work around for the excuse every single time like somewhere so you spelled each other based on the honor system and you only asked for relief when it was impossible to keep your eyes open any longer then your buddy would ask for a sit rep and that was it you'd be a sleep almost before you'd zipped up your feather down fart sack that's what they call a sleeping bags if you didn't pick that up the last time i used it guys didn't have watches what's happening i asked when my foxhole partner woke me from my turn not a thing he replied and he was out like a light still inside my sack i sat in the darkness in the edge of the hole got my eyeballs unglued and tried to remember where i was i was fantasizing about smoking a cigarette drinking a hot cup of coffee eating a charcoal black rare steak and getting a squad of my own wind to my amazement i saw man lying prone immediately to my immediate left rear i woke up my buddy there's a goddamn shake almost on top of us we whispered through our options we could toss a grenade blasting with a rifle or crawl out and getting with a knife we decided on the third alternative because the guy who's right in the middle of our squad position and rifle fire or a grenade could easily start a firefight among our own guys the chink wasn't moving and his back was to us my buddy covered me while i crawled out of the foxhole with my trusty m1 and ten inch razor sharp bayonet attached i crouched in a crouched position i silently slipped up behind the enemy soldier when i got within sticking distance i drew my rifle and thrust it with full force branches crackled and it was over i'd bayonet in my own frozen stiff trousers which i'd earlier hung over a bush behind our foxhole to dry the next morning i had to put the shitty things back on again now with a hole in the ass as well and for some reason the fresh meat was the only one in the squad who didn't think this was very funny my hands are not really worse I feel like my capacity maybe my enthusiasm sometimes less but that might be just because I got more stuff going on as an adult you see I don't know no the last if you're joints of sore don't worry joculous when did you become an adult how are you I want to say like mid 30's I think it was mid never to be honest but I don't know I think it's a slowly slow gradual we're still heading there kids kids kids kids move that forward when you have kids you start to become an adult pretty quickly and he's in Europe back to the book gradually most of the world war two warriors went back to the states and the post war wild west feeling of lawlessness went to and it'd been great fun for a kid to be part of the hell for leather spirit that made up the 752nd the 752s but like the tightening of a screw one turn in a time each day the unit became more military the who gives a damn attitude of the remaining 752 combat leaders and troopers replaced by the exacting discipline of the peace time army for the next four years i learned my trade one year with the recon company of the tank battalion in the poe valley and three more months with trees united states troops and this were the anacronum trust comes from trees united states troops the illustrious unit whose five thousand hand picked members Walter Winshal called quote the chrome plated soldiers of Europe we worked hard during those years long merciless days of training repeating training repeating repeating repeating until we got it right our transformation into soldiers inspired and monitors by those battle savvy n n c o's who well knew that discipline and tactical proficiency on the battlefield were the direct results of discipline and combat skills instilled on the parade and training grounds at night it was down on our hands and knees all of us hand waxing the barracks floors until we had enough money to chip in and buy a buffer you could eat off those floors just as you could just as you could almost be blinded by the brass belt buckles and brown boots that each of us wore polished every night to a dazzling finish the only way out of these activities was sick call
