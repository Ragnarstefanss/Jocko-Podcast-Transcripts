00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 56 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000 Silent screams and broken dreams. AddX, junkies, pushers and feens.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000 Crowded spaces and sad faces never look back as the police chase us.
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000 Consumed slowly by chaos, a victim of the streets.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000 Hungry for knowledge, but afraid to eat.
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000 Life of destruction, it seems no one cares, a man child alone with burdens to bear.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000 Trapped in a life of crime and hate, it seems the ghetto will be my fate.
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000 If I had just one wish, it would surely be that God would send angels to set me free.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000 Free from the madness of a city running wild.
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000 Free from the life of a ghetto child.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:39.000 And that is a poem written by a young, deandre macula, a criminal drug dealer who, when he wrote that poem, was doing time.
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000 After being one of the main subjects in a book called The Corner, which is written by David Simon and Edward Burns,
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000 which documents the violent drug trade in Baltimore, Maryland.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000 And that sort of morphed into an HBO series that was called The Corner as well, which paved the way for another series,
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000 which is called The Wire, which is just an outstanding mini series that came out on HBO.
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000 But The Wire is fictional, even though it's based on kind of the same situation in Baltimore, but The Corner's real.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:34.000 The book The Corner's real, and it gives a very clear, any very grim view at the life of drugs and crime in the inner city, namely in Baltimore.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000 And I'm going to go back to the book now.
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000 We can't stop it.
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000 Not with all the lawyers, guns, and money in this world.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000 Not with guilt or morality or righteous indignation.
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000 Not with crime summits or task forces or committees.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000 Not with policy decisions made in places that can't be seen from the lost corner of Fayette and Monroe.
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000 No lasting victory in the war on drugs can be bought by doubling the number of beat cops or tripling the number of prison beds.
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000 No peace can come from Kingpin, statutes, and civil, civil forfeiture laws and warrantless searches.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000 And whatever the hell else is about to be tossed into next year's crime bill.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000 Down on Fayette Street, they know.
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000 Today, as on every other day, the shop will be opened by mid-morning, and the touts will be on the corners, chirping out product names as if the stuff is street legal.
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000 The runners will bring a little more of the package down, and the fiends will queue up to be served.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000 A line of gaunt, passive, supplicant, stretching down the alley and around the block.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000 The corner is rooted in human desire, crude and certain and immediate.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000 And the hard truth is that all the law enforcement in the world can't mess with desire.
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000 Down at Fayette and Monroe, and every corner like it and Baltimore, the dealers and fiends have won because they are Legion.
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:24.000 They've won because the state of Maryland and the federal government have imprisoned thousands and arrested tens of thousands, and put maybe a hundred thousand on parole and probation roles, and still it isn't close to enough.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000 By raw demographics, the men and women of the corners can claim victory.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:44.000 In Baltimore alone, a city of fewer than 700,000 souls, with some of the highest recorded rates of intravenous drug use in the nation, they are 50, perhaps 60,000 strong.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000 Three of them available for every prison bed in the entire state of Maryland.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000 The slingers are manning more than 100 open air corners serving up the product as fast as they can get it off the southbound metro liner.
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000 And the fiends are chasing down that blast 24-7.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:16.000 In neighborhoods with where no other wealth exists, they've constructed an economic engine so powerful that they'll readily sacrifice everything to it.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:27.000 And make no mistake, that engine is humming, no slacking profit margins, no recessions, no bad quarterly reports, no layoffs, no naturalized unemployment rate.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000 Get it straight, they're not just out here to sling and shoot drugs.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000 In drug markets, in cities across the nation, lives without any obvious justification are given definition through a simple self-sustaining capitalism.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:06:03.000 The corner has a place for them every last soul, doubts, runners, lookouts, mules, stick up boys, stash dealers, and forces, fiends, burn artists, police snitches, all necessary in the world of the corner.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.000 Each is to be used, abused, and ultimately devoured with unfailing precision.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000 It's about the fiends, thousands of them who want that good dope, they need it.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000 The way other souls need to breathe air.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000 It's about the slingers, the young crews working the packages, all of them willing to trade a morality that they've never seen or felt for a fleeting moment.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:48.000 They're working the package with the hidden knowledge that they will fall, that with rear exception, the money won't last, and the ride will be over in six months, or four, or three.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000 Violence.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000 Violence is no longer the prerogative of the professional, but a function of impulse and emotion.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000 The contract killers and the well-planned assassinations of earlier eras are mere myth on these corners.
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Now, the moment a truth generally comes down to some man-child with hurt feelings waving a 38 around spraying bullets up and down the block.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000 The accidental shooting of bystandards is now commonplace.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000 Even 15-year-old hoppers have loaded 38's hidden in the alley.
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:49.000 The job is a little better than a death wish.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:04.000 In the end, the corner best serves the hard core, the junkyard dogs with neither the time nor the inclination for pity.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000 The corner proves itself every day.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000 It destroys whatever it touches.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000 And eventually, the corner destroyed DeAndre, McCullough.
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000 Even though he received the second chance in his life, and he actually got to play a small role in that series that came out on HBO, the wire.
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000 He got some other jobs in the entertainment industry as well, but the corner called them back.
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.000 And that guy, DeAndre, who wrote that poem, he ended up dead over heroin overdose in 2012 at the age of 35.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000 Now, there's a reason I'm bringing all this up, and that is because we have a guest tonight.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000 A guest that is actually more responsible for this podcast than anyone, and we'll get to that later.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000 But his name is Peter Atia.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000 And he grew up a boxer, been a long distance, and during South Leigh,
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:28.000 got his degree in medical engineering and applied mathematics, and then got his doctorate as an MD from Stanford.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000 And it is residency in surgery.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:48.000 And the reason that I started off this whole talk about the corner is because he did that residency at a place called John Hopkins Hospital,
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000 which is about three miles from the actual corner of Fayette, Monroe Street.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:06.000 The war zone that's pictured in the book, the place where DeAndre, McCullo lived, and where violence was, and in many ways still is just a part of life.
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000 And Peter was at Ground Zero in the war zone.
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000 And saw more darkness and suffering probably than any person should have to, and learned a lot from it.
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000 And we're going to get to that in a bit. But first of all, Peter Atia, welcome to the show.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000 Thank you for having me, sir.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000 Glad to have you on finally.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000 And you grew up. We'll get right into it.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000 You grew up, tell us a little bit about just growing up. You grew up in Canada.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000 You know, you've covered, if for those of you that hadn't listened to the Tim Ferriss interview with you, listen to him, what does that three of them?
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000 Yeah, I think there's three of them. You can listen to those and get more details on Peter, his whole background.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000 But for those that are just listening right now, you grew up in Canada, gives a little, little statement about that.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:17.000 I grew up in Toronto. You know, immigrant parents, so grew up, you know, sort of in the wonderful lower middle class, not the best suburb of Toronto.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000 It's Toronto, like New York has five boroughs. Four of them are nice. One of them is not. I grew up in the one that's not so nice.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000 And meaning it's just a dump. I don't know how to like, it's, you know, it's not like a war zone or anything.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000 And I have lived now in the United States for about half my life. So I high school in college was in Canada and then everything from Med School beyond has been here.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000 And I am now a dual citizen of the town.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000 How did that transition work? Because you didn't, you obviously applied mathematics degree.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000 And then you worked in the civilian world a little while with that degree, right?
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:05.000 So my plan was always to do a PhD in aerospace engineering. And so that's why I did the mechanical engineering and applied math.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:14.000 I did the two things for undergrad got it. And then was sort of just in the almost about ready to go and start that PhD in aerospace.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000 And then I had just a complete change of heart and decided I wanted to go into medicine.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.000 So that, so what I had to do for a year then was you got to take this thing called the M cat, which of course I didn't have any of the courses to take it.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000 So I had to sort of teach myself the chemistry and biology that summer took the M cat.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000 But then I still have a lot of times that's what I do in the summer time. I'll teach myself you.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000 Yeah, chemistry and biology.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Yeah, I didn't do that well.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:51.000 And then I had to do what's called a post back year where you go back in the process of applying to medical school without actually having the courses to get in.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000 So if you get in it's conditional.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000 And so that year because I'd already graduated, I just taught calculus.
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000 So I was like a, you know, adjunct lecture at the university and taught calculus, which I always enjoyed.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 I mean, because I taught it for a couple years before.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000 And so that's why you're waiting to get into medical applying and then and getting my courses like I forget what I had to take biology and psychology biochemistry.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000 I'd to take a few prerequisites to get it because in engineering and math I'd never taken a single course.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000 In fact, the day before I took the M cat, this, this is only going to be funny for geeks who get biology.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000 So I'll, okay, I'll find a moment.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000 But that won't be made.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000 Yeah, I'm studying for the M cat this summer that I'm supposed to take the test and the whole time I'm studying.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000 I'm like, you know, I can't believe how sloppy these textbooks are.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000 They keep confusing myosis and my toesus.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000 Like why can't they just spell it the same way both times?
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000 Like they, I didn't realize that it was two separate things, right?
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000 Myocies is when a cell separates.
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000 Separate spirits and they.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000 But doesn't replicate its DNA.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 My toesies is when it creates an equal copy.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000 And I literally not until the day before the M cat realized that those were two separate things.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000 And that's how how how clueless I was going into this test.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000 Yeah, and it was a lucky reason I knew that was because I was helping one of my daughter study for their biology something.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Yeah, anybody who took any biology course should know that.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000 But I hadn't taken any.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000 So it's like you get in medical.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.000 Yeah.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000 You go there.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000 What's that?
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.000 Four years?
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000 Another four years of school.
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000 Uh-huh.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000 And then you get done with that.
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000 And now it's time to do your residency.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000 So, you know, do you get to pick where you're going to go?
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000 Not sort of.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000 So it's a funny system called the match system.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000 So when you're in your.
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000 Yes, you're beginning your fourth year of medical school.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 By that point, you have to figure out what you want to do.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000 Do you want to be a surgeon?
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000 Do you want to be an internist?
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000 Do you want to be a pediatrician or radiologist?
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000 Whatever you want to do.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000 Because all of those have different programs.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000 And then you have to apply to those programs.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000 So let's say you wanted to do orthopedic surgery.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000 You would send out your application to all the orthopedic programs in the country.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000 Hopefully you'd get interviews to a good number of them.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000 You'd go do the interviews.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000 And then you would submit to a match system, a rank order, of the places you'd want to go.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000 And you don't put something on there that you don't want to take.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000 So if you.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000 If you.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000 You know, if you applied to 30 programs, you got interviewed at 15 and you liked 10.
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000 You rank those 10 in order.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000 Similarly, the programs after they interview everybody do the same exercise.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000 And they do the rank.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000 And then a computer matches you one to one.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000 That's actually pretty square to a.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000 Yeah, so you.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000 The only way you're going to guarantee you know where you're going is rank one program and hope you get it.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000 So in my case, I think I ranked five programs.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000 And I ranked Johns Hopkins first for surgery.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000 And I'm not because I wanted to live in Baltimore though, in many ways, I think it was a blessing to do so.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000 But you know, because.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000 At the time, I don't know that this is true today, but at the time it was probably the best general surgery training program in the country.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000 And that was a combination of two things.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000 One is you had these kind of legendary surgeons there that had pioneered.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000 Some of the most complicated.
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000 What are called hepatobiliary surgeries, surgeons, you know, surgery of the pancreas and the liver and stuff like that.
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000 But at the same time as you alluded to, it was in a war zone.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000 And so the other aspect of training to be a good surgeon is having great exposure to penetrating trauma.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000 So trauma, you always want to divide into blunt and penetrating.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000 Blunt trauma is not often operative.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000 So people that get hit by cars and things like that.
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000 You know, ends up being more orthopedic.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000 But if you're a general surgeon and you need to be able to cut open the chest and the abdomen and things like that.
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000 It's penetrating trauma.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000 It's it's you want knife and gunfight.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Not that you want it. But that's that's the training ground to be in.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000 So and and sort of Baltimore would have been, you know, probably in the top five.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000 What year was this?
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000 2001.
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000 2001. Yeah.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000 2000.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Okay.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000 And when you were what was it?
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000 What was the thing that slipped or this is going backwards a little bit?
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000 What was the thing that transitioned in your mind?
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000 Were you all the sudden one?
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000 Do medicine?
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000 Well, yeah, it's funny.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000 I don't know if I've ever talked about this publicly.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000 So when I was in engineering school, I in my second year I started doing some volunteer work.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000 And I this the reason why is too complicated, but I started volunteering with.
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000 Some kids that were in a in a shelter that had been abused.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000 So it was a home for sexually abused kids.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000 And that got me interested in sort of volunteering in a hospital.
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000 So I was volunteering at a hospital that had you know, it was a pediatric cancer ward.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000 So you would just sort of, you know, you'd go up there and you'd kind of hang out with kids and just play with them and stuff like that.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000 And so between that experience and then I was still doing this volunteer work with these kids who had been sexually abused.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000 A lot of those kids were suicidal.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000 So I also found myself in the hospital a lot with these kids after they attempted to kill themselves.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000 And I think somewhere in my senior year of engineering, I kind of had this, you know, I don't know what the word is.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000 I don't think it's an existential crisis as much as maybe a nervous breakdown.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000 But just a bunch of things were kind of going on probably some undiagnosed psychiatric issues on my part.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:39.000 But I realized like, I love engineering and math intellectually, but there's no emotional connection outside of the joy of solving a problem,
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000 which by the way is probably plenty enough.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000 But I wondered if there was something else that I'd be more interested in that could scratch two inches, right?
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000 It could scratch sort of the intellectual inch, but also maybe an emotional inch.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000 And so I spent the majority of my senior year thinking about, was there something else I ought to do?
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000 But I'd been successful in my undergrad, so it was sort of a given that, you know, if you're going to graduate at the top of your class,
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000 you're going to go off and do the best PhD program.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000 So at the very end, when I sort of declined to do that and I turned down a bunch of scholarships,
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000 it seemed a little odd that I would go and do medicine.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000 But that's really the reason it was kind of this epiphany I had one day actually,
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000 while I was in the hospital when I was sort of had this.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000 Actually it's really funny, we just moved as we were talking about earlier.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000 And one of the things moving is great for is cleaning up stuff.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000 And I actually found my essay that I wrote when I applied to medical school back in, you know, whatever, 95 or 96.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000 And it was really interesting to go back and read the story because it's exactly kind of how I remembered it, right,
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000 which was like this moment I had this sort of insight that this is what I wanted to do.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:00.000 So, so that's kind of the series of events that led me to have that seemingly or thog and all change in direction.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000 Okay, so now you go through that, you end up, you get your accepted do you residency at John Hopkins, you show up there.
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000 What's that like?
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000 Well, I remember when I interviewed at Hopkins for medical school as well,
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000 and I was lucky enough to get in there for medical school.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000 And at the time, I think Hopkins was technically the best medical school in the country.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000 I think it was Harvard and Hopkins where the best two and Stanford was, you know, maybe third, fourth, fifth.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000 But I remember when I interviewed there for medical school at the end of the interview,
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000 like I had to spend the night there.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000 And so they put us up in the dorms for the med students, which is great idea you get to meet your upper classmates.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000 And I remember I said that Friday night, I said, hey, I'm going to go walk down to the harbor.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000 It's like a mile and a half down the road and they're like, oh no, no, you can't do that.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000 I said, what do you mean?
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:00.000 They said, you can't walk outside of the hospital. And then they pointed out that on every corner, there was like a booth with an armed guard.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000 There's a guard in full armor with an automatic weapon.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000 And so I remember the time thinking, yeah, I probably don't want to go here for med school.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000 So, and of course, Stanford sort of for a guy who'd never been to California and who'd lived in miserable cold weather as whole life.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000 I was like, it could have been a hundred-thranked medical school.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000 I was still going there.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000 So, I have some actual stats that I pulled up.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000 So, war zone in 1993, there was 48 murders for every hundred thousand people.
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000 There's what's seven hundred thousand in the city.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000 The next highest was in 2015, 55.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000 And in 1993, again, there was 353 homeless sides, homicides.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Yeah, almost one a day.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000 And so, you know, I have to put this in there.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000 Because we're sitting here calling it a war zone. So, when I was in Ramadi in 2006, the one one AD,
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000 which is the Ready First Brigade, you know, five thousand, six hundred soldiers,
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000 while we were there with them for six months, they lost 61 guys.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000 So, what I'm saying is, now, that doesn't count the enemy casualties.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000 Yeah.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000 But it counts the friendly casualties that are showing up at our med center.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Right?
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000 There, you know, you're talking three or four hundred, well, you just said one a day.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000 Yeah, about one a day.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000 Okay. So, so you knew how bad it was when you got, well, you know, I sort of knew it was dangerous.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000 But I think when I decided that, you know, for this, that season of my life,
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000 you got to sacrifice everything, and you got to go to the place where you're going to get the best training.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000 And I didn't want to leave California because, you know, four years in California,
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000 for the first time was, you know, when you know, you guys know what it's like.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000 Yeah.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000 I mean, it was like, I don't ever want to leave this place.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000 But I also knew I just couldn't get that level of training on the west coast.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000 And it was, you know, you basically had to go to a place like Hopkins,
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000 Bergman, Wobbans, in Boston, maybe Wash U, in St. Louis,
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000 was going to offer a very similar environment.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000 So then, you know, so then I ended up ranking it first.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000 They ranked me first.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000 So away, we go, we get lucky.
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000 We get a very good match made in heaven. And that's like kind of February of your senior year.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000 And then reality sits in, which is you've got sort of four months until you have to show up.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000 And that was kind of like the, oh, shit moment, right?
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000 Like that I really just signed up for this.
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000 And a good friend of mine who was two years ahead of me in medical school.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000 His name is Brian Donham. He's now a pediatric head and neck,
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000 and at Chopin Philadelphia. He was at Hopkins, which was at the time the best earnosen throat program in the country.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000 And he actually recommended I read this book, the corner.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Because, and Brian's one of these guys who's just, you know, he's just, he's like a Renaissance man,
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000 you know, like not only is a great surgeon, he's like a gifted artist.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000 He has side job as medical illustration.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000 Like you can't believe what this guy can do.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000 But he's introspective, right? And he was, he said, look, you know,
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000 you're, you're going to sign up to be in this war zone.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000 And you're going to be taking care of people that it's going to be very easy to despise.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000 So he said, you need to read this book to gain a sense of their perspective.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000 Because very, like I said, you know, so at the time, I can't remember the stats.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000 I feel like at the time that I was there, we averaged about 16 penetrating traumas a day.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000 Now to put that in perspective, in general, surgery, your on call every second to every fourth night.
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000 So average about every third. I mean, every third night, 120 times a year.
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000 You will spend the night in the hospital, not sleeping, waiting to take care of any trauma patient.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000 So if every third day and night, you know, 16 of these people are getting shot and stabbed,
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000 you're going to have a lot of time in the ER in the trauma bay, dealing with that.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000 And it's really easy to get jaded really quickly.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000 It's fun for the first month. And then all of a sudden, every time somebody gets shot,
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000 it's preventing you from sleeping.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000 Which when we're sitting here all well rested, sounds like a very callous thing to say,
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000 but all of a sudden, you're sort of like, damn it, man.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000 I can't eat because the trauma page or just went off again.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000 To this day, I still eat shockingly fast, and it drives my wife nuts.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000 But she doesn't understand. I said, I think it's just, I'm a victim of you never know
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000 when you're going to have to stop what you're doing, and that might be your last meal.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000 Even I shave quickly because the worst thing that could happen is you got shaving cream all over
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000 and the trauma page goes off and you've got to run down half shaved.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000 You got one side of your beard down on the other side.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000 That's a stupid thing like that.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000 So that was Brian's recommendation.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000 So I got the book immediately, devoured it, found it to be the most depressing thing I had ever had.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000 It is heavy.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000 It's heavy.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000 They've made more depressing by the fact that they pulled no punches.
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000 No names are changed.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000 So every person you read about, you are reading about it and a completely unsensored, unfiltered way.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000 And I mean, you read it.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000 You're not going to have to be happy about this book.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000 You just finish it and you think, yes, you have more empathy than you understand
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000 where these folks are going to be coming from.
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000 It's not like you finished that book and go, ah, here's the solution.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.20 We need a six point plan that's going to do X1.
00:26:25.20 --> 00:26:26.30 It's like I don't actually.
00:26:26.30 --> 00:26:29.000 That's kind of why I read that one excerpt.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000 We can't win, which is an awful thought.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000 And that's what that's the impression the book gives you.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000 It's we can't win.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000 And I don't that the way you phrase it of being like,
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000 it doesn't matter how many police and whatever you do,
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000 you're going against human desire.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000 Well, the stat that you reiterated, and I remember it very well
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000 from when I read this book the first time was,
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000 you couldn't take every junkie and put them away.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000 If you took every federal and state prison bed in Maryland,
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000 you'd have three people for it.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000 If you just looked at the users, never mind the guns,
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000 the money, and everything that comes with it.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000 So yeah, that's not a solution.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000 Now, there's a second reason that I don't think Brian knew,
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000 because I don't think anybody knew that that book really hit home,
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000 which it sounds tangential to this story,
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000 but it becomes highly related.
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000 At the beginning of end of my third year of medical school,
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000 I'm going to the gym one day, ride my bike,
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000 as I always do.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000 I get off my bike, go to lock it up,
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000 and I was like, my back really hurts.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000 Really hurt.
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000 Not like, oh, it's a little stiff.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000 Something feels horrible.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000 So I started walking down the steps to the gym,
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000 and I was like, not gonna happen today.
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000 I couldn't do anything, I couldn't time my shoot.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000 So I just went back, got on my bike,
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000 rode back to my apartment, told my roommate,
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000 I was like, hey man, I'm gonna go lay down upstairs.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000 The next morning I woke up, I couldn't get out of bed,
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000 and to make a very long story short,
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000 over the next two weeks, I completely deteriorated.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000 You know, I was at the point where I could get in and go to the hospital,
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000 but I had to have the nurses,
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000 this is back in the Wild West days,
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000 where you could just sort of get anything you needed at the pharmacy.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000 You know, I'd get nurses or residents to inject
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000 or all into me, which is a really strong end said,
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000 I could only sleep if I laid in an L shape over the nurse's station.
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000 And it just wasn't getting any better.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000 And then one day, it pain changed immediately.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000 I realized in retrospect what happened, a herniated disc had fragmented broken off,
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000 so the pain in my back dissipated,
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000 but now I had this, what turned out to be a 4 centimeter fragment,
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000 sitting on my S1 nerve root.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000 So now it felt like my left foot was being skinned from the bottom.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000 But that was constant, so that was an unrelenting pain,
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000 and it could only be sort of brought under control,
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000 if I could put my foot into a bag of ice,
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000 because then I could make my foot go numb,
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000 and then I could take some pain medicine.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000 So this one, on for another week, and then the Dean of the Medical School,
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000 saw me limp in through the hospital,
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000 he said, what's wrong?
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000 And I told him, and he dragged me down to the ER,
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000 we got an MRI that showed all of this.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000 And I was in surgery the next morning.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000 This was a Sunday night, Monday morning,
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000 I'm in the OR.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000 It turned into a disaster.
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000 The guy who operated on me, I prayed on the wrong side.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000 So I woke up.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000 The left issue was still present,
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000 but now I had what's called a foot drop on the right side.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000 So foot drop is when the nerve that holds your foot up,
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000 which we take for granted when we walk.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000 But if you don't have the ability to what's called dorsiflex,
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000 your foot would drop, you can't walk,
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000 you'll end up dragging your toe when you keep tripping.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000 This story, I mean, we could spend three hours on the story,
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000 because it's so idiotic.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000 The punch line is I eventually needed many trips back
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000 to the operating room.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000 This guy refused to believe there's anything wrong with me.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000 It took another amazing doctor and neurologist
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000 to actually intervene on my behalf.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000 And three months later, I'm unable to walk.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000 I'm unable to do anything.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000 My mom actually had to fly down from Toronto to look after me.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000 And I'm sort of, you go through the checklist, right?
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000 So there's, I don't know if you've ever heard of Elizabeth Kubler Ross.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000 I don't think she's alive anymore, but she wrote a very famous book
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000 on the stages of dying.
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000 And it goes through anger and denial and finally acceptance at the end, right?
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000 And so you know bargaining, it's something that would make sense if you,
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000 and I'm sure you've heard of that.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000 And you've probably watched it on really small scales.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000 In combat, you might see these things over the course of compressed.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 Yeah, with a cancer patient, you might see this stretched out over a year.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000 And so I was kind of going through this on my own, right?
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000 We're initially, it was like, oh my god,
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000 what if I don't finish this rotation I'm doing right now?
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000 I'm going to be a surgical sub-internship to, well,
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000 what if I don't graduate on time?
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000 To, what if I can't be a surgeon?
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000 And then it was, what if I don't walk ever again?
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000 So somewhere along the way, I don't remember exactly when,
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000 probably like a month and a half into this.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000 I finally caved in and started taking pain medicine.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000 I thought that's where this story was going.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000 I was like, at some point, he's going to get on the open.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000 Yep. And I had been so reluctant to do so initially.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000 Been so stoic, you know, just taking my NSAIDs and even using
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000 Benadryl, which is a horrible pain medication, of course,
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000 but it sedates you through some of the pain.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000 And so I, you know, started taking per cassette.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000 And per cassette is, it's typically 10 milligrams of oxycodone.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000 So oxycodone is the fast acting version.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000 It's stronger than say a vik so a vikodin is Tylenol and hydrocodone.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Immediate acting, but hydrocodone is not as strong as oxycodone.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000 So per cassette is stronger than vikodin.
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000 They both have Tylenol. It's just the opiate is stronger.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000 And so, you know, if you take a per cassette,
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000 which would have 500 milligrams of Tylenol and 10 milligrams of oxycodone,
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000 you know, I probably was taking, you know,
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000 you start taking two, three, four, five, six of those a day.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000 You develop a tolerance.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000 And eventually, there's a long-aracting version called oxycontin,
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000 which is just a time-released version of oxycodone.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000 So then you would take that twice a day.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000 So at my peak, I was probably taking 80 milligrams of oxycontin a day,
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000 plus another 120 milligrams of oxycodone.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000 I just got rid of the Tylenol altogether.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000 You can just get straight oxycodone.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000 And so I'm about 200 milligrams a day of oxycodone.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000 Equivalent. And again, if I took that today,
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000 I would just die of you just not breathing.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000 But at the time, you know, you build up this tolerance.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000 But it also, there was this point where I realized
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000 that I wasn't just taking it for the physical pain.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000 Right? And I think this is the single most important insight I had
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000 that when coupled with reading that book, six months later,
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000 was the, I think the single most important realization I ever had
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000 with respect to this problem,
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000 which was, at some point it was, I was just so depressed
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000 that I couldn't walk. And I was so worried that, you know,
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000 I'd never be able to do anything again,
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000 that at least the drug gave me a high that took me away from that.
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000 And so then it got to the point where I was just taking that drug
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 all the time, and I just stopped engaging,
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000 like, wasn't engaged with anyone anything.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000 And then I sort of had this realization that that was happening.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000 And I was like, I want to stop.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000 So at the time I was dating this girl,
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000 she was an anesthesiology resident. She was a few years older than me.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000 Just the coolest, coolest person.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000 And I said to her, she was kind of the only one that knew what was going on.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000 Because at the time, even the doctors who were prescribing this,
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000 like, this just wasn't on people's radar as a problem back then.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000 I think today people would be like,
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000 homeboy's got 200 milligrams of oxycon today.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000 That's probably not good, but at the time it was just like,
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000 it was like, tick tax, right?
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000 So that would legitimately kill it.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000 If I took 200 milligrams with that, that would really jack someone up.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000 I would think, I think if I took 200 today, I would stop breathing.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000 Yeah, because that's how opiates kill you.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000 They repress, they inhibit respiratory drive.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000 Whenever someone overdoses on heroin, they just stop breathing.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000 So yeah, I think 200 would, I don't know.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000 We'd have to, I'd have to look at the farmed one.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000 We don't have to actually, you have to stay here one before that.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000 So the girl you're eating.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000 She said, you can't just stop, right?
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000 The withdrawal is so painful that you have to taper off.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000 You have to probably go on methadone,
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000 and then you'd have to start some pretty potent anti-depressants.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000 They, like, M-A-O-I's or T-C-A,
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000 so you have to go on a drug like nor trip to lean,
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000 which is an end of itself kind of a crazy thing.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000 And I was like, yeah, but I think I'm just going to stop cold turkey.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000 Now, unlike alcohol, so if you took an alcoholic,
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000 you know, you took someone who's drinking 20 alcohol,
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000 you know, alcohol beverages a day,
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000 and they've been doing that forever.
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000 And you stop them, they will die.
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000 They will get something called delirium trements,
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000 and they will die a horrible cardiac death.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000 They will break into a rhythm,
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000 and they will die.
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000 So when we had alcoholics in the hospital,
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000 let's say we had to operate on somebody who happened to be an alcoholic,
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000 we would actually just put them on an ethanol IV.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000 We weren't even trying to detox them.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000 We just wanted to make sure they didn't die,
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000 and go into these delirium trements.
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000 But heroin and opiate is not like that.
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000 It is not physiologically lethal to stop cold turkey.
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000 It's just unbearable.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000 And so I was like, I'm going to do it.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000 So against her better judgment,
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000 I just stopped one day.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000 And she could not have been more right.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000 It was the darkest.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000 I mean, I got laughed about it now.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000 It was the darkest month of my life.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000 It was a month?
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000 Oh, at least.
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000 I mean, it was, I would just sit on a park bench
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000 for the whole afternoon,
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000 like complete flat affect.
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000 But it's all mental.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000 It's not a physical thing.
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000 No, there's physical stuff going on.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000 I mean, but, but no, it's,
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000 yeah, you, you, you sort of like, you know,
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000 opiate's make you itch like crazy.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 You get constipated.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000 So there's like a reversal of a whole bunch of physical stuff.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000 But the biggest thing is the craving and the depression.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000 And so the depression of coming off this thing was brutal.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000 In many ways, and I don't tell that story to say,
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000 well, look at how special I am that I detox.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000 That's not a point at all.
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000 I had two things going for me that virtually no junkie has going for them, right?
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000 The first is, I didn't have a network of people around me
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000 that we're doing the same thing.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000 So I was sort of the only guy doing it.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000 So for me to go and be around my friends was to be around people who weren't doing this.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000 We always used to joke that if you really want to kick a heroin head,
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000 but you have to get a whole bunch of new friends.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Like you, you don't get to decide you're not doing heroin,
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000 and then go back and hang with your friends that are doing heroin.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000 You need to watch trainspotting to learn that.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000 The second thing, and perhaps the more important thing,
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 is I finally did connect with a doctor who was able to put me on the right path.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000 So I, I had ended up going back to the operating room.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000 Probably a half a dozen times over the course of the year
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000 to have, all these problems corrected.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000 And then I found something else to fixate on, which was physical therapy.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000 So I started to, you know, even though it didn't seem like exercise,
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000 it wouldn't seem like exercise today at the time.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000 It was the first activity I was able to do.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000 And so, you know, within six months, I could like walk
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000 like a reasonable distance again.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000 And so I would be spending three hours a day at physical therapy
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000 just doing like the most trivial exercises.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000 But basically the root cause of my depression was getting better.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000 So that's really the only reason I think I was able to kind of detox off this stuff.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000 Whereas I think for many people,
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000 hey, it's not clear what the root cause is or be.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000 It's not getting better if it is clear.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000 And so that's why I think it's really, it's a brutal addiction.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000 And it seems like also you had a future.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000 Right, you had a life, you were in medical school.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000 You're going to, you know, you're, yes, I think there's a lot of these people
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000 that are drug addicts.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 What do they, they have no life that they're looking forward to.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 They're just looking forward to it.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Absolutely.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000 And so in February of that senior year when I had to submit my rank list,
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000 I think we match in March and Misspoke earlier,
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000 I was still not functional perfectly.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Like there was no way in February of 2001 that I could have with
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 the statistical residency.
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000 But I had to make a decision at that point,
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000 which was will I be ready on July 1st.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000 And if I won't be, I should not submit my rank.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000 I should defer a year, sit out of your medical school, whatever.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000 And I remember that was the hardest decision I'd to make.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000 And I just gamble.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000 I was like, you know what, I'm going to be ready.
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000 And I'm going to make it happen no matter what.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000 And so I submitted, matched, and then in addition to now reading the
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000 corner to prepare for Baltimore and reflecting on my own sort of
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000 struggle with addiction, which was completely fresh in my mind.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000 I'm also like rehabbing like it's my day job.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000 And going through like, and I,
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000 most people take the last quarter and med school off,
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000 but I didn't have the ability to do that now because
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000 I had to go straight through till graduation day because I'd missed so much
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000 time during my injury.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000 So when I showed up in Baltimore a couple of days before July 1st,
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000 I mean, it still wasn't crystal clear to me that I could go,
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000 you know, two days without sleeping, standing in an OR for eight
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000 hours at a time, all those sorts of things.
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000 Now, that's one of the things, the sleep deprivation,
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000 because people always, obviously, I take a lot of slack because I don't sleep
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000 a lot and the sleep deprivation.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000 So what did that, but what's that like when you're going through residency?
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000 And you're just saying, I mean, there's days where you're going 24,
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000 48 hours, no sleep, and how did that affect you?
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000 What did you think of that?
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000 What do you think looking back at it?
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 What's your opinion of it now?
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000 Well, you know, when I decided that I was going to go in the surgery,
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000 I mean, I always, I'm pretty insecure in general.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Most people don't necessarily appreciate that on the outside, but always thinking,
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000 I don't know if I've got what it takes, your how do I figure it out.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000 And so my whole MO in life is test the system hard.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000 So when I was in medical school, still deciding this, I figured, well,
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000 every Thursday night, I'm going to pull an all nighter in my room,
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000 standing up, not allowing myself to eat, sleep, drink, pee, do anything,
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000 and I'm going to stand up my desk for eight hours and practice suturing.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000 You know, sort of try to mimic what it would be like to be an operating room all night,
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000 not being able to go pee, not being able to drink, not being able to do this thing.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000 And so I had a little bit of confidence, you know, I figured, okay, I can do this.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000 Like I can pull an all nighter once a week, that's, you know,
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000 not that that's a good thing to do, but it was like kind of a confidence thing.
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000 Right.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000 So then you show up, but there's no preparing you for what you're in store for.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000 Now, I got to point out, this is not the way it is anymore.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000 So in 2000, I want to say like four.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000 It's like labor laws came in.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000 Exactly.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000 A whole bunch of laws came in that we could spend hours talking about how it turns out the laws haven't.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000 They haven't fixed the underlying reproblem, but nevertheless,
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000 a whole bunch of work requirement hours stuff got fixed, right?
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000 So you couldn't work more than 80 hours in a week or 88,
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000 depending on if your program had an exemption,
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000 and you couldn't work more than 24 hours consecutively and stuff like that.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000 But by the time those laws really kicked in, I was already gone.
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000 And so I don't really know what it's like today,
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000 but I would imagine it's less demanding from a sleep deprivation standpoint.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000 But at the time, there were no such rules,
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000 and you were at the sort of every second, every third,
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000 every third, every fourth night call, but then your post called day, you would still work.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000 So our mutual friend Kirk Parsley, which of course is how we met,
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000 this is one of his favorite stories about me.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000 He loves this story, because it's so crazy.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000 So this is July of 2001.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000 So I am one month into being a doc, right?
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000 And I'm on an every third night call rotation at this hospital called Bayview,
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000 which is about five miles from what we call the mothership,
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000 which is Hopkins.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000 And it's out in like East Baltimore.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000 It's in a real crappy part town, not that there's a real, I mean,
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000 I hate saying this, but I don't,
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000 there aren't that many good parts of town, at least back then,
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000 and Baltimore.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000 And so I'm, so I show up on a Monday at five o'clock in the morning.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000 So I slept in my own bed Sunday night.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000 So Monday morning, I show up at five to round.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000 We do our whole thing.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000 And that night I'm supposed to go home.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000 So that's my off call.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000 As you call your swing day, you show up at five.
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000 You'll be home by seven p.m. that night, if all goes well.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000 So you worked your, you know, 14 hours,
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000 and then you sleep in your own bed,
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000 and then you get to come back the next day,
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000 and then you're going to be on call.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000 So we're rounding that afternoon.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000 So, and the, one of the senior residents says,
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000 hey, so and so didn't show up for their shift in the ER.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000 The ER always staffs one surgical resident full time.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000 And this guy just didn't show up.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000 And she's like, and it's a seven p.m.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000 to seven a.m.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000 Shift.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000 Can you cover it?
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000 And you know, this would be like,
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000 if you asked the most junior guy, you know,
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000 to do something like, he, he'd be kicking his own ass to say yes.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000 Like, he couldn't wait to do that, right?
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000 So I was like, hell, yes, I will do that.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000 So then I go down to the ER,
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000 and I work all night, seven to seven.
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000 And then the next morning is now my on call day.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000 So now I'm seven a.m.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000 cranking away until that night,
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000 and then I'm up all night on call.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000 So, and then it's now Wednesday,
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000 and it's my post call day,
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000 and I'm there till five or six p.m.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000 So I've basically been up from about four a.m. Monday,
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000 and it's now five or six p.m. Wednesday.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000 And I get in my car to drive home,
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000 and I have to make it,
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000 I have to go down this miserable street called Eastern Avenue
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000 to hit the 83 to drive up to my place.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000 And I'm driving along Eastern Avenue,
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000 which is like red light after red light after red light,
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000 or stop sign or whatever,
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000 and every time I met a stop light,
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000 I fall asleep, my foot pops off the clutch,
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000 and I stall.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000 Like, I am so tired,
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000 I can't even handle the gradual easing off the clutch
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000 and the gas just to move up and up.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000 I can't do it.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000 So finally, in one moment of lucid clarity,
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000 I'm like, you can't get on the freeway,
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000 you're gonna die.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000 So it's like, what's the solution?
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000 I was like, you gotta get over and take a nap.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000 So I pull over my car on the side of Eastern Avenue,
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000 right in front of this park called Patterson Park,
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000 which at the time,
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000 I don't think I fully understood that that was an open air drug traffic market.
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000 So I got up, but here's the best part, sorry.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000 The logical thing to do would have been just been stayed in the car
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000 and taken a nap.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000 But I was like, I haven't seen the sunlight in like days
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000 and it's the sun is still out.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000 Like, I'm gonna go nap in the park.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 So I get out of the park,
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000 I'm in green scrubs that are covered in blood stains
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000 because I was too dumb to not change.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000 I go laid out in the park,
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 I take my page off and I clip it
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000 to my neck and I set the alarm to go off in one hour.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 There's like seven p.m.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000 It'll wake me up and I'll feel perfectly rest
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000 and I'll be able to drive home.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000 So I laid out in middle of Patterson Park.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000 And the next thing I know I wake up,
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000 it's like one in the morning, two in the morning.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000 There's needles everywhere.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000 There's, I have like a bites on my arm
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000 that look like they're from rats
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 because they're nothing I've ever seen before.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000 Like these bites all over me.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000 And I'm just thinking myself like,
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000 how did I not get killed here?
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000 Like the only thing that prevented me from dying
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000 was how ridiculous the site was.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000 You know, if something's so strange,
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000 like not, you know,
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000 so I was like God damn it man.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 So I get back in my car and drove home.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000 And when I tell Parsley that story,
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000 he loves it because he's like,
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000 that's the classic example of how
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000 complete deprivation of sleep
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000 and pairs your judgment.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000 So, you know,
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000 there were a couple stories in residency
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000 where I had to do like those three night
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000 back to back to back to back.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000 Another time it happened,
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000 I remember was in an O5.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000 Do you feel like though, okay,
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000 driving a car is kind of boring, right?
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000 Stop lights.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000 But when you're really tired,
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000 but then all of a sudden something happens.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000 Like boom, I feel like when that happens,
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000 I feel like in lock on,
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000 there's almost no amount of sleep deprivation
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000 that will stop me from functioning
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000 and getting something done that's important
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000 on task, on time.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000 Absolutely.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000 Is that true?
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I think so, yeah.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000 No, I think in adrenaline rush
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000 in the moment.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000 I've been able to provide any amount of
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000 clarity and focus that's necessary.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000 The problem is very few things are life or death that way.
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000 Now in your world,
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000 there were plenty of things.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000 But in my world, not.
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000 And this is the extra,
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000 I was going to tell was,
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000 in probably my third year,
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000 I think it was my third year.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000 I was the same sort of deal.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000 I ended up covering for somebody
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000 and then covering for two people
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000 and two consecutive nights
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000 and then it was my turn.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000 So, that was like three straight nights
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000 of not sleeping.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000 And it's the middle of the night,
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000 and this guy comes in the ER
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000 who's got a really diseased gall bladder
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000 and in retrospect,
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000 it should have never come out that night.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000 But a lot of times,
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000 the dirty little secret is surgeons
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000 want to operate at night
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000 because they can get better OAR time
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000 electively as opposed to waiting the next day
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000 if it's not emergent.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000 So, sure enough,
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000 we're in the middle of the operating room
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000 doing a laparoscopic gall bladder removal
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000 at two in the morning
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000 when we don't really need to be there
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000 at two in the morning.
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000 We could have slept
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000 at the next day.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000 And sure enough,
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000 so in a lapar,
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000 removing a gall bladder is a two surgeon procedure.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000 So, there's the main surgeon,
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000 which because we're teaching hospital,
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000 I'm the main surgeon.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000 I'm actually doing the operation
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 and then there's the attending
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000 who's holding the camera
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000 and retracting for me.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000 So, I'm doing this.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 And yeah,
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000 that's a stimulating activity,
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000 but of course,
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000 I've done a hundred of them,
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000 so it's not that stimulating.
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000 Well, I can't stay awake.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000 And I finally somehow managed
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000 to fall asleep on this patient.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000 Like, I faced plant into the patient.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 Luckily, it was laparoscopic,
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000 so I didn't contaminate the surgical.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000 But so,
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000 even something is stimulating is surgery.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000 Because if the guy's aorta was bleeding,
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000 I'm just like,
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000 I would've said,
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000 yeah, exactly.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000 But now,
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000 I was like,
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.000 yeah,
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000 when I was gallbladder's no big thing,
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 yeah,
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.000 yeah,
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 it wasn't stimulating enough
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000 to overcome three days of sleep debt.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Did you figure out any tricks
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000 or any, you know,
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000 for instance,
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000 when I was going through cell training,
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000 and even my whole career,
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000 and even to this day,
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000 I take little power now,
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000 so if I'm feeling that tired,
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000 I elevate my feet,
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000 and I sleep for like six to eight minutes,
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000 and it totally returged me.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000 Did you take power now?
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000 No.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000 Aside from your power now,
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000 you have a seat.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.000 You have a seat.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000 I was in seven hours,
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000 and almost got as you killed.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000 I did.
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000 I once took a power nap in my car.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000 Again, same thing.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 It was like eight o'clock at night.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000 I got to the pool.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000 I had a rule,
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000 which was after you left the hospital.
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000 You never went home.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000 Because I knew if I went home,
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000 I wasn't going to leave.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000 So I would always go from the hospital
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000 to the gym,
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000 or the pool,
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000 or whatever I was doing.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000 And on this particular night,
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000 I get there.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000 It's eight o'clock at night.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000 I am so tired.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000 I'm nauseous.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000 Like the thought.
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000 So you didn't want to go home
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000 just because you knew you'd go home.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000 I thought it was a sleep.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:11.000 I thought it was a sleep.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000 You didn't want to go to sleep,
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000 because you've been awake for three days.
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000 Why didn't you want to go home?
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000 Why didn't you want to go home?
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000 Well, because I was really funny.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000 I got a friend of mine who again,
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000 a couple years ahead of me,
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000 gave me interesting advice.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000 Whether it was right or wrong.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000 I don't know.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000 He said,
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000 you're going to be tired,
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000 no matter what in residency.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000 Don't stop doing all the other things in your life.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000 Because you'll still be tired.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000 Now,
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000 I don't know that that was the right advice.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000 But I took it hard.
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000 I thought advice.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000 And on my view was,
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000 I'm going to continue to work out.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000 Every day,
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000 I'm not on call.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000 I'm going to do all the stuff I want to do.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000 So yeah,
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000 so it would be to the pool.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000 And so same thing,
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000 I got there.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000 But on this particular night,
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 I was so tired.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 I was so nauseous.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000 I couldn't suppress the desired vomit.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000 And I was like,
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.000 I'm not going to,
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000 if I puking the pool,
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000 they'll kick me out.
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000 I won't get this one.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000 It's just not going to be worth it.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000 So I was like,
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000 just sit here for like 30 minutes
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000 and take a quick nap.
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000 So same thing took the page right,
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000 which normally could wake me up.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000 Clip it here.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000 And it was freezing,
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000 because there was like the winter.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000 So I left.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000 No,
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000 it wasn't cold.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000 But I remember wanting to leave the radio on.
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000 I like a dumbass.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000 So the car is off.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000 So alternator is off.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000 Radios on.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 What, you know how the story ends?
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000 I wake up at 2 in the morning.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000 Batteries dead.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000 I'm in the middle of the parking lot.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000 I can't, you know.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000 Had to call my girlfriend to get jumper cables to get me out.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000 That's a one that girlfriend went on to become my wife.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000 So short answer.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000 No,
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000 I didn't have a great strategy.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000 I did have a friend who,
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000 and I never tried this.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000 But he told me he would put coffee grounds in his eyelids.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000 Apparently it hurts so much that you put in closer eyes.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000 Okay.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000 You know, that's, I mean,
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000 I would not that, but I've told people this all the time too.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000 You know, do do a little bit of physical exercise.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000 If you're super tired,
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000 that definitely picks you back up.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000 There's got to be some reality or some scientific reason for that.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000 Happening.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000 That's another thing you can do.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000 But,
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000 so you are so okay.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000 We know it sucks.
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000 You're not sleeping and you're dealing with these patients.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000 And, and how do you start to
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000 detach
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000 from this reality that's around you?
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000 So you're not getting, you know,
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000 you, you, you said already you like the kind of the emotional involvement with people.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000 But then at the same time,
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000 you said it didn't take long before you despise these patients that are coming in.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000 Because they're interrupting your sleep and bothering you.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000 That's got to be a crazy balance to try and strike as a human being.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000 I mean, human beings are not meant to be dealing with
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000 16 puncture wounds a day.
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000 That's, that's not right.
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000 So what, what happens in your brain?
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000 What happened in your mind?
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000 What did you notice about your mentality and this whole business as time went on?
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000 Well,
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000 what I noticed,
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000 so again,
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000 not everybody becomes jaded,
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000 but most people do.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000 And where where my sense of jaded
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000 developed was actually towards, you know,
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000 the patients of diabetes,
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000 the patients who had complications from being overweight.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000 Like when those people would show up with, you know,
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000 the abscess and their foot in the middle of the night that needed to be
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 debrided,
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000 those people I would get, again,
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000 pretty pissed at.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000 Amazingly,
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000 the,
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000 the,
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.000 you know,
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000 these, these trauma folks,
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000 like I kind of always maintained a soft spot in my heart for them.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000 And interestingly,
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000 you know,
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000 it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, once they die,
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000 you know, so what happens is like,
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000 let's say a guy comes in,
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000 you guys been shot.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000 You know, generally people who are dead in the field don't make it in.
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000 So, so, but, but sometimes there's this gray zone where,
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000 you know,
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000 someone comes in who's basically dead,
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000 but because they had a little bit of a pulse on the way in the door,
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 like we're going to do everything we can.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000 But a lot of times when those patients die,
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000 like the room has to be turned over really quickly,
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000 which means someone's got to come in,
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000 take the body, put it in a body bag,
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000 gather everything because usually these are criminal investigations.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000 So the police are there,
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000 the housekeeping staff has to come in and mop all the blood off the floor,
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000 because depending on where the gunshot wound was,
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000 like gunshot wound at the head, for example,
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000 tons of blood,
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000 because the head's a confined space.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000 Um,
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000 and in that moment,
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000 it's really easy to just immediately walk out the door,
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000 but I find myself, you know,
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:24.000 I, I'd,
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000 I'd sometimes like flip through their wallets,
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000 right?
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000 And,
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000 you know,
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000 invariably you'd see something like you'd see a picture of a little kid.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000 So you,
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000 you see this guy who's huge,
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000 who's just been killed,
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000 he's probably 25,
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000 and you'd see like this six year old girl in his wallet.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000 And you, you know,
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000 you'd start to sort of wonder what the narrative is, right?
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Like,
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000 was that his daughter?
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000 Probably.
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000 Did he know her?
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000 Probably.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000 Did she know him?
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000 Maybe not.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000 Like, you just don't know.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000 And all of a sudden,
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000 that's, that's sort of humanizes these,
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000 these guys.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000 And, and again,
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000 I think because of my own understanding of what they were dealing with,
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000 because of those 16 penetrating traumas,
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000 15 had to be drug involved,
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000 in one way or another.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000 And so everybody who we're taking care of for the most part,
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000 was some part of the cycle that's being described in the corner.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000 Now occasionally it wouldn't be.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000 I mean,
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000 one of the examples that stands out that was,
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000 I would say sort of like,
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000 a top five saddest things I ever saw in residency
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000 was July 1st, 2002.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000 I just happen to remember that day
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000 and this girl on her 16 years old,
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000 she was a girl on her 16th birthday,
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000 came in and she was just,
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000 she was just hit by a stray bullet in her neighborhood.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000 It was her 16th birthday,
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000 stray bullet from,
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000 you know, unrelated gang violence,
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000 hit her in the head.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000 And, you know,
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000 she's an example of someone who came in
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000 basically dead,
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000 but in situations like that,
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000 like, you know,
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000 I'm sure you can relate to this.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000 You're just going to do something that's so,
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000 beyond her road.
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000 You want to do anything and everything to try to save her.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000 And of course, we couldn't.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000 So, you know,
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000 those examples are kind of rare,
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000 but the majority of the times,
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000 it's, you know,
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000 executions for people who stole money.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000 That's,
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000 those would be hard to see, right,
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000 because you could,
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000 these girls, you know,
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000 this is like,
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000 this is a deadly game.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000 No, even the,
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000 even the girl,
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000 the 16-year-old girl,
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000 she's part of the cycle too,
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000 because that's a stray bullet.
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000 That's right.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000 She's in a,
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000 she's in a lousy neighborhood.
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000 You can almost guarantee that,
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000 you know,
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000 if she's living in where she's living,
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000 to get hit by a stray bullet,
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000 like, you know,
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000 she wasn't living in,
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:22.000 you know,
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000 Roland Park.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000 And,
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000 and when, once you did,
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.000 did you,
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000 would you ever see any family?
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 Would any family ever come in?
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000 Yeah,
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 so there's two types of things going on, right?
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000 So, so,
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000 the,
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000 the biggest,
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000 problem we would have
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000 would be real gang on gang stuff,
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000 because,
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000 it became sort of a feed forward loop, right?
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000 So, if one guy came in and he was killed,
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000 you immediately knew the floodgates were going to open,
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000 because there's going to be retaliation that night.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000 I don't remember that the police were pretty,
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000 good about trying to,
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000 make sure that,
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000 like, when someone came in and who was killed,
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000 like, if you weren't immediate family,
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000 you were not allowed there.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000 And they also tried to create a little bit of a delay
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000 and letting that information out.
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000 Again,
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 maybe that wasn't the,
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000 the,
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000 the most considerate thing to do,
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000 but their view was trying to let the violence dissipate.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000 Um,
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000 yeah,
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000 the family stuff's hard.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:20.000 I mean,
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000 the hardest family interaction I ever had
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000 with it was with actually a blunt trauma,
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000 and it wasn't involving drugs at all, right?
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000 This was a,
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000 this was,
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000 um,
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000 a boy.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000 He was 15 years old.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000 He and his brother,
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000 his older brother,
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000 who was probably 18,
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000 had picked him up after school.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000 They were driving home.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000 And they were,
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000 they had the right away,
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000 and a guy ran a red light
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000 and teaboneed them on the passenger side.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000 And this,
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000 the 15 year old boy,
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000 the older boy came in as an adult trauma.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000 So he went to the adult side.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000 I happened to be on pediatric surgery.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000 Like I was the senior resident on pediatric surgery
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000 that month.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000 So I ran the pediatric trauma,
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000 which is where the 15 year old came in.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000 And that turned out that older,
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000 the driving sun was fine.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000 He didn't have a scratching on his body.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000 But this kid came in,
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000 basically dead on arrival.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000 Though it wasn't clear why,
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000 but his pupils were blown,
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000 um,
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000 you know,
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000 little bit of a pulse,
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000 we did,
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000 you know,
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000 probably 30 minutes of everything imaginable
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000 before accepting the reality
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000 that he cheered his Aorta.
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000 So if a high enough force
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000 can actually shear the Aorta
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000 and it dishexed,
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000 and you basically bleed to death
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000 inside the wall of the Aorta.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000 And that's why he died.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000 And that was another example of how
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000 everybody just sort of scatters after that.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000 But you know,
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000 his mom is in a waiting room,
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000 wondering where her boys are,
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000 who,
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000 you know,
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000 could have been an offender
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000 for all she knows.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000 So,
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000 those were,
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000 I mean,
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000 unquestionably the most difficult
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000 discussions ever,
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000 because trauma is the one area
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000 where there's complete surprise.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000 Like,
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000 you know,
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000 it's tragic when somebody dies from cancer.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000 It's even tragic when somebody dies
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000 during an elective surgical operation,
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000 which happens,
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000 unfortunately, in the meantime.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000 But at least there,
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000 you have some heads up
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000 that's something dangerous is going on.
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000 But this kid,
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000 like,
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000 you know,
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000 said goodbye to his mom that day,
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000 went to school and never came back.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000 And now she hears,
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000 oh,
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000 he's in a car accident,
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000 and she's in the hospital,
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000 never imagining that he could be dead.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000 And then you have to be the guy that goes in and say,
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000 you know,
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000 I'm really sorry to tell you this,
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000 but your son is dead.
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000 You know,
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000 there's actually a really interesting,
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000 article written in The New York Times
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000 on this exact topic,
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000 but I'm an interesting story.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000 So my mentor in medical school
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:46.000 to this day,
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000 one of the closest mentors I've ever had
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000 as a guy by the name of Steve Rosenberg.
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000 So Steve Rosenberg is the chief of surgery
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000 at the National Cancer Institute.
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000 And he's kind of one of the luminaries
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000 in immunotherapy.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000 So I did my postdoc with him at the NIH.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000 And I actually spent time there in medical school,
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000 and actually he just called me yesterday
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000 out of the blue.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000 We didn't have to have a great catch up for 30 minutes.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000 His daughter,
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000 his three daughters, his youngest daughter,
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000 is Naomi Rosenberg,
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000 who's a resident at,
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000 and I think she's an emergency room doc at Penn,
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000 which is also when a war zone in Philly,
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000 and she wrote a great piece on this,
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000 which maybe we could link to in the notes or something.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000 It's probably like the last three months
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000 about the difficulty of having to communicate
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000 to families when tragedies like this happen,
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000 which of course you should see a lot of as well in Philly.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000 And then that happens.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000 So you do everything you can to save this kid's life.
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000 And then you walk in,
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000 you face the mother,
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000 you drop the most devastating,
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000 possible, imaginable news on her.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000 And you gotta go back to work.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000 I mean, right?
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000 I mean, don't you then have to,
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000 you have to go work again now.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000 Yeah, that night in particular,
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000 that was, that was,
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000 I remember that day pretty well.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000 That was April of 2003 when that boy died.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000 And by the time we had declared time of death,
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000 and I had gone to talk to his mom,
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000 it was probably like 10 o'clock at night.
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000 You know, I probably spent an hour with her.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000 And of course it's disruptive because you're in there
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000 and your page is going off.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000 I've got the ER calling me about this kid,
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000 I've got the ICU calling me about this.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000 And she's, you know,
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000 I mean, like, I gotta,
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000 I gotta sure hope I never have to know what she went through,
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000 because I can't, can't really imagine, right?
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000 I mean, she's hysterical at a level that you just,
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000 like a movie doesn't do justice to that.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000 Like you don't see that level of hysteria normally.
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000 And I, that was certainly like one of kind of the three or four
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000 that really upset me the most.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000 I mean, I, I had a real hard time,
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000 and I think I got lucky that night.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000 I think that night and that I'd be in a pretty calm night.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000 I remember I got to probably spend some time
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000 just alone in a calm room that evening, you know.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000 And, and for me that was,
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000 so the, this is the awful thing here.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000 We tend to project what's going on in our own life
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000 into any situation.
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000 I mean, I, I think I realized that pretty early.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000 And so I think in the case of that particular trauma,
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000 I saw in that boy, my brother.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000 My brother, my younger brother.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000 And so I, so I was dealing with two things in that moment.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000 One was,
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000 meaning from my own and not, not the immediate issue,
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000 which is this boy died.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000 One is, I'm imagining now like this could be me
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000 and my brother in high school.
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000 Like this could have been us.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000 And how, how your life changes after that.
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000 Like I thought his brother's life is never going to be the same.
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000 The second was, this was already after I had decided
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000 to leave medicine altogether.
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000 Which was in June of 2006.
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000 And this, this trauma was like April of 2006.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000 So I've decided in March of that year that I was just going to finish that year and then leave.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000 So, so the other thing that was sort of that I was struggling with,
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000 which probably makes this a little heavier than it needed to be,
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000 was,
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000 as painful as this is,
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000 it's a privilege to be this person.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000 It's a privilege to be the guy who gets to try to save a life.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000 And even when you fail,
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000 that interaction you're going to have with that family,
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000 which I think is something Naomi wrote about in that piece.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000 It's so important.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000 It seems trivial to us because you have that interaction over and over and over again.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000 But to that family, it's so important.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000 That will be with them forever.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000 And I think I felt that that was a privilege.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000 And so I think I realized like, I'll never do this again.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000 I'll never again have that privilege to,
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000 even if I fail to try to, you know, sort of say somebody to actually then be able to,
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000 comfort that family.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000 And that sounds really weird.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000 It's a very morose sort of thought to have.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000 But all of those things, I think, in that particular example,
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000 you know, made for a really difficult set of, you know, days and weeks at fall.
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000 And I went to his funeral.
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000 First patient I ever went to a funeral of a first trauma patient.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000 Certainly went to the funeral's of patients.
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000 You've got to know through, you know, people were dying of cancer and stuff.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000 But, you know, trauma patient, like you just wouldn't think to go to someone's funeral
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000 that you'd never known because like, I'd never known that boy, right?
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000 I stayed in touch with his mom for a few years and not surprisingly,
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000 their life just completely fell apart, you know.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000 Does it make it that much worse that you got this,
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000 you juxtaposed the kind of this normal kid, right?
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000 Who dies this random accident?
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000 And then at the same time every night, you've got people that are killing each other.
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000 And you're seeing the results of that and you can't do anything about it.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000 How does that also play into your thoughts about, hey,
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000 I'm here trying to save these people's lives and they're out there killing each other.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000 For over nothing, over the street corner, over this, over that.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000 Did you go down that road mentally?
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000 Not there. I'll tell you the one time I felt really ethically,
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000 maybe ethically, it's too strong, a word, but just to be blunt.
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000 I mean, the one time I was really pissed off that I was trying to save somebody's life
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000 was a guy that came in who killed his wife, killed his daughter,
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.000 and then put the gun in his under his chin and pulled the trigger and missed.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000 So he basically blew off the side of his face and was still alive.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000 His brain was completely intact.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000 This guy was going to survive after 23 face operations.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000 And I'm taking care of this guy and the ICU and I'm kind of pissed off about it actually.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000 And maybe I shouldn't be, who am I to judge this guy?
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000 But I'm like, you killed your wife, you killed your kid and you wanted to die.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000 Why the hell am I putting anything into you?
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000 Now, of course, that is a slippery slope because in medicine we're never supposed to play that role.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000 We're never, we never play God.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000 People, some doctors want to act like they're playing God, but we never play God.
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000 We're just there to do a job.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000 And on that day, I remember thinking, I got to do this job.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000 I don't want to take care of this guy.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000 I want this guy to die actually.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000 How do they address that when you're going to medical school?
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000 That whole idea.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000 They've got to cover it out.
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000 Or is it just so underlying the underlying theme of everything you do
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000 at the time you get done?
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000 It's there.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000 That's a really good question.
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000 I don't know.
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000 Are there ethics classes in medical school that teach you that?
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000 I am sure there are.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000 The fact that I can't tell you one thing about an ethics class, I took, tells you it's
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000 that whatever ethics you have are going to be independent of whatever class you're taking.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000 And who knows, today, these pendulum swing from one end to the other.
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000 For all I know, you know, half the curriculum could be ethics today.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000 I don't know.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000 But the short answer is I think, you know, it's sort of internal.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000 And the reality is, you know, if you're in a good program and the one thing I'll say,
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000 I mean, as much as Hopkins was a brutal place to exist.
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000 The camaraderie there was unbelievable.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000 I mean, you know, the nickname for the residence was the Hallstead Marines, right?
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000 Which, again, doesn't do justice to real Marines,
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000 but that was sort of the camaraderie, right?
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000 It was like you would do anything for your, you know,
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000 that's why you'd always volunteered to stay up three nights to help somebody else out.
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000 And so, you know, I had really great friends there.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000 In fact, to this day, like some of my closest friends, people that I'm in touch with
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000 almost every day were guys I went through that experience with.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000 And you could talk about those things with each other, right?
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000 I mean, you know, it was okay to say, like, I really wish this mother fucker would die.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000 Because he's taking up a bed.
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000 He's costing the state a million bucks.
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000 And I hate him.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000 And I somehow being able to talk about that, I think, makes it a little bit easier, right?
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000 Well, absolutely.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000 I mean, any, that's what happens in the military.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000 You get guys that go through tough situations, tough battles,
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000 and they, they become closer going through it.
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000 And part of the thing that brings them closer together is to your talking about what's going on.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000 Has it happening and after it happens?
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000 What did you,
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000 I mean, I think that's what I'm talking about.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000 So a lot of times in this podcast, I say that this podcast,
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000 yeah, we talk about war and we talk about leadership and we talk about history.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000 But I find that the actual root of what the podcast becomes about is,
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000 is really about human nature and what people, what human beings are like.
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000 Was there, I'll give you both sides of this question, did you learn anything about people about human nature?
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000 There, that was surprisingly positive.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000 And before you answer that one, did you learn anything about human nature while you were there?
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000 That was surprisingly negative.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000 So, so I'll give you one thing that I learned that I don't know that I would call positive or negative,
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000 but it was an observation that in retrospect seems obvious,
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000 but it never would have, I never would have thought of it before and to this day,
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000 it still serves me well to understand it.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:50.000 So the first observation is that when you look at a significant illness,
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000 like a completely disruptive insult, you know, cancer,
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000 you have pancreatic cancer, which means you're going to die, and you're going to die soon.
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000 There are two types of families that come into that situation.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000 So families that show up already fractured get blown apart.
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.000 Fractures that, for families that show up already tight become the tithest of any family.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000 The same would be true when you see a kid that comes in, a burn victim,
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000 right, this kid that gets burned badly on the 4th of July, and this kid's going to spend the next two months in the hospital.
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000 You know, a couple that comes in with tension already in their marriage,
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000 they get splintered wide open.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000 If they came in and everything was fine, they're going to be there for each other.
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000 They're going to be tighter.
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000 So that was an observation that I just saw over and over and over again.
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000 And I saw it in probably even more vivid color when I was at the NIH,
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000 because the two years I was there, you know, as mostly doing research,
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000 but you still had clinical responsibilities, and so you're basically seeing patients who are coming to receive experimental therapy for cancer.
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000 So these are patients who are all, you know, otherwise going to die within six months.
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000 And most of them will still go on to die, obviously, the subset of them we can help,
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000 but you're seeing that over and over again.
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000 So that was the first observation.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000 And then the second was that there were just a couple of residents who I couldn't believe how amazing they could be,
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000 who how they could never sort of do the wrong thing.
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000 So there were two residents in particular.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000 One really, he was, he, his name is Chris Sondende.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000 He is now a, he's a transplant surgeon at the University of Michigan, amazing guy.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000 And so Chris was two years ahead of me. And I mean, he was like that guy that I would have done anything for.
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000 And I remember when I was leaving, thinking to myself, you know,
01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.000 I'm really glad I'm leaving because if I stayed, I'd know I could never be as good as Chris.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000 Like that, like how can someone be this good?
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000 And I don't mean, like he can sew this good and cut, I don't mean even medically.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000 Good human being. Just as exactly as a human being.
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000 He is on a level. I can't get to.
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:26.000 And, you know, I don't know anybody else who can get there either, but the fact that I can't get there is a little upsetting to me.
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000 And I'm glad I don't have to spend the rest of my life chasing him.
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000 Which of course, Chris would never think of it that way.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000 Because that's the nature of being that guy as you, he's just completely humble, modest, unassuming guy,
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000 who just happens to be a guy.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000 You know, it's going back to the first point that you mentioned, and it's something that I've heard people talk about as well.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000 My buddy's talk about is, you know, the whole idea of post-traumatic stress and all that.
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000 And what war does to people?
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000 And one thing that I happen to agree with is pretty similar to what you're saying.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:15.000 And what is going into the war, right? If the person is got a good stable mindset and a good attitude and is a positive person,
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000 and they're going to come out of it with all those good positive things amplified.
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000 They're going to be more positive. They're going to be stronger. They're going to be mentally tougher.
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000 It's the people that go into it that are already somehow fractured.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000 Those fractures are going to get worse through the trauma of combat.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:39.000 This is a broad generalization. And there's definitely great guys that see things or do things that they, that it hurts.
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000 And it takes them a while to get through it.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000 But there's also some guys you go, you know, that guy was messed up when we showed up.
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000 And now he's worse in it. And it's that pressure that opens up those fractures even wider.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000 And it's interesting that you got this, you saw that with family structures as well.
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000 And I could completely see how that happens.
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000 That happens. That happens. Right. That happens. And you don't even need trauma to make that happen.
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000 I mean, you get the financial trauma on a family. If they're not tight, that'll, that'll make them blow up.
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000 Yeah. Whereas if they're tight, you know, going through some financial problems, they'll get tighter.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000 They'll buckle down. They'll save money together. They'll skip the movies. They'll start, you know,
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000 they'll enjoy cooking raw manoodles together.
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000 So that trauma can, can expose those fractures. That's why it's important to try and
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000 create the most solid foundation you can with your family and with your own mind.
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000 So that when these traumas hit, you don't get fractured.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000 Do the seals screen for that.
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000 They try to, but you'll like this story.
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000 So we had to take a psychological screening. This isn't a 90.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000 So it wasn't like we were super advanced on any stuff.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000 And I'm going, and when I was going through bootcamp,
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000 they gave us a psychological screening for, for our attempt to go to to seal training.
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000 And so they asked a bunch of questions and it was complete the sentence questions.
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000 And so it would, it was really obvious what would, what would flag you.
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000 And for, and, and so I made every answer, because we, I was in bootcamp and the food sucked.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000 And so every answer that I gave was just all about food.
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000 So for instance, they, they'd say complete the sentence.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000 I hate when my mother, right? So it's pretty easy to think to say,
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000 you know, I hate when my mother shuns me in front of my sisters and I want to kill her.
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000 No, no, no, no. All my answers were like, you know, I hate when my mother over cooks this steak
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000 and doesn't put enough pepper on it.
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000 You know, just like every answer I gave was about food.
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000 But it was really easy. My point is that it was really good.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000 If you were not a complete, even if you were, if you, in fact,
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000 if you were a psychopath, you would very easily say, answer all the questions correctly and get through it.
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000 And there's been plenty of guys that made it through seal training that, you know,
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000 there's, there's a bad criminals.
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000 There's, uh, there's been a couple really heinous crimes committed by guys that were seals.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000 And just, just, if they made it through, they got screened.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000 So yeah, they, they had a screening, but I wouldn't say it's the most effective.
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000 They've gotten better now, you know, and some of those guys that committed horrible crimes,
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000 it, you know, kind of inspired the seal teams to step up that screening process as much as possible to make sure that we're not let guys through that are,
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000 that are deranged some way that are going to do something horrible like that.
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:31.000 Um, you kind of already talked about these, but is there any other thing that,
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000 that you learned about yourself in that situation?
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000 And, and you, I didn't really know too much about the, uh, where you went afterwards at the NIH?
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000 If you want to go into that a little bit, but what did you learn about yourself through this whole process?
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000 Obviously you learned something because at some point you decided, you know what, I don't want to, I don't want to do this.
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000 Yeah, I mean, those are, those are some of the most interesting years of my life.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000 And I am pretty glad that I didn't have my first kid till I was 35,
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000 which on the one hand you sort of think, well, God, I'm so old, you know, like I'm not going to be,
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000 I'm not going to be like the 50-year-old grandfather, right?
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000 Um, but on the other hand, I think it's a really good thing because when I think about what was going on in my mid to late 20s,
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000 you know, the sort of really difficult decisions I had to make.
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000 I mean, leaving medicine after being in it for 10 years was a really difficult decision.
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000 Especially to go and do something that had nothing to do with medicine.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000 I mean, when I left, I joined a consulting firm McKinsey in company,
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000 and I did credit risk modeling.
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000 Like I didn't have a think.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000 The fact that I was a doctor was like a liability.
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000 There was no, like it was like starting all over again in life.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:51.000 Um, so to get to that point, yeah, I had to go through a whole bunch of stuff.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000 So I think, I mean, I don't even know where to begin.
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000 I mean, I think one thing I learned was,
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000 so this fellow that I alluded to earlier Steve Rosenberg, who is,
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000 again, to this day probably one of the most important mentors in my life,
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000 outside of family members.
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000 Um, just an amazing human being, right?
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000 So just kind of on another level.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000 And I remember even asking him after being in his lab for two years.
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000 Because remember, we had a couple of people in the lab who I just didn't think were that good.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000 They really bugged me.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000 They're existence bothered me.
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000 And I, and I finally after being in the lab for two years,
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000 worked up the courage to ask him like how he,
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000 because he's like this guy who's going to win a Nobel Prize.
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000 Like he's changing the game.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000 And yet we had a couple people that I kind of thought were bottom feeders.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000 And I was like, you never get upset at them.
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000 Like ever, I've never seen you get upset at these people.
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000 How?
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000 And he said, you know, Peter, I just look at everybody
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000 and I figure out at least one thing that they can do well.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000 And I just figure out a way to empower them to do that one thing,
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000 even if they can't do the ten things that I would expect you to do.
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000 I remember thinking, I understand in theory what you're saying.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000 I can't do that.
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000 I can't tolerate mediocrity.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000 So that was a huge thing that I learned.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000 And it never really hit home again until I was running a non-profit.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000 Because there wasn't a lot of mediocrity at Hopkins.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000 You sort of had your pick of the best residents there.
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000 Everybody there was the best at what they did.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000 You had amazing nurses, amazing residents,
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000 amazing respiratory therapist.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000 And like everybody there was like the best of their field, right?
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000 And then I go to McKinsey same thing.
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000 You've kind of got the best of the best all over again.
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000 But you know, fast forward five years, I'm now running a non-profit.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000 Well, all of a sudden you don't get the best at the best anymore.
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000 You're drawing from like the third pool.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000 And I remember coming back to that, which is, you know what?
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000 You're probably not cut out to do this.
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000 You have two choices.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000 Don't be a leader.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000 Just be your own dude.
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000 Or be a leader.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000 But only with A players.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000 But this notion of like you have the capacity to mentor the C players.
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000 And maybe turn it into a B plus player.
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000 Like I don't have those genes.
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000 I can't do it.
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000 And not only that, like I will destroy the C player.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.000 And I don't mean to, but I will bury them in the ground
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000 and become a horrible human to them.
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000 So I also realize like I can be a really bad person.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.000 If I don't, if I don't respect the work that someone's willing to do.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000 So do you, or do you ever have to find a counter to that?
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000 Because like if you're in the military and you and I were working together,
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000 I would be like, hey Peter, you got to get, you got to get, you got to act like,
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000 what is it, what is it, whatever.
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000 You got to act like him.
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000 Because in the military, you're not getting a player.
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000 So I mean, you got some great guys.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000 You, you know, sealed teams.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000 You got some great guys that are stud.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000 You got some okay guys that are in the middle.
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000 You got some losers down at the bottom.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000 Guess what?
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000 You need everything.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000 Go on the tongue.
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000 And they all got to give you what you everything may can.
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000 And the more you create conflict with them and the more you are talking
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000 down to them, the less they're going to do.
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000 You know how they're already a sea level player or a sea level player.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000 Yeah, they're going down.
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000 You're not, you're not making them any better.
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000 So that's, did you ever try and correct that or you just go through and say, you know what?
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000 You've realized that that's like a weakness of yours.
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000 I want to be clear.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000 There are two attributes that you can be a sea player in and I can cope with one,
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000 but I can't cope with the other.
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000 And I accept it fully.
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000 I can cope with someone who has a sea plus intellect.
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000 So if you think about the intellect as the CPU or the computer,
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000 I don't need everybody to have the fastest CPU.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000 I accept the fact that like we all have different sort of innate capacities to sort of process
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000 and do and you know, we all move at different speeds.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000 I can cope with variability there where I cannot cope with variability or maybe I've just chosen
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000 I don't want to.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000 Is I can't cope with variability on intent, work ethic, integrity.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000 Like when you, if you can't be an A player there, I actually don't want you in my life anymore.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 And I think I'm old enough now that I've just had fuck it.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000 You know, I'm not going to deal with it anymore.
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000 Life is too short and I'm not going to deal with sea players who fail on those metrics.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000 Right?
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000 I don't care how smart you are, but if you can't show up and work your ass off,
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000 if you can't be honest, if you can't care, if you can't want to get better,
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000 I actually don't want you in my life.
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000 So you're right.
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000 I probably, I mean, I think I'm probably not cut out to be a leader because I can't take
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000 those people who are failing on those metrics and work with them.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000 Well, you just need to be a leader of a very high performing team,
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000 not of a regular regular team.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000 Yeah.
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:50.000 Yeah.
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000 I never had problems, right?
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000 So when I was a resident, you know, residency is very hierarchical, right?
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000 You know, you've got the med student, the sub by, the intern, the second your resident,
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000 the senior resident, the chief resident, the fellow, the attending.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000 I mean, it's, it's, it's as clear as day who's in charge any moment in time.
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000 And as I'm going up through those ranks, for the most part,
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000 I never really had difficulty with the teams underneath me, but again,
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000 I had the luxury being at Hopkins.
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000 Everybody there is the best.
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000 The best student, they're the best, they're the resident, they're the best.
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000 McKinsey, same thing.
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000 You know, you're dealing with the best of the best.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000 But yeah, running a non-profit, it was like a totally different world to me.
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000 And so I think the difference is a great leader could have succeeded in any environment.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000 You know, they could have done it.
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000 They could have figured out like, okay, the reason this person, like, acts like a lazy
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000 sack of shit is actually because of this.
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000 And you can like figure out a way to like, touch them and help them out of that.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000 And I was just like, yeah, I'm not doing it.
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000 So that was, so that's, that's going back to NIH.
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000 And you, that was the first time you dealt with people.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.000 That's the first time I'd sort of seen in a long-term working environment, like a couple
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000 people who weren't top agents.
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000 And again, maybe part of it's because you're in the government at that point.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000 And you get some staff people there, maybe who, you know,
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000 and part of it, I think, was just because Steve Rosenberg was such an amazing guy.
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000 And he could get the best out of everybody that he might have just had a greater tolerance for that.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:28.000 I think the second thing I learned was I would never be a world-class scientist.
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000 So when you go to NIH, you're really only going for one reason.
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000 I mean, I'm sure there's some people that go there just to check the box and say,
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000 I was at the NIH.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000 That wasn't why I went.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000 I went because Steve Rosenberg was my hero when I was in medical school.
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000 I read his book called the Transform Cell.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000 And I was like, that book just, you know, that book along with another book by a guy
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000 and Richard Feynman called Shirley, your joking Mr. Feynman became kind of two of the most important books.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000 You know, I read during, you know, my 20s.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000 And actually wouldn't date somebody.
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000 I wouldn't date a girl until she read them.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000 I'm going to go into after the podcast.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000 You and I'm going to go to a full on counseling session.
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000 You need help.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:20.000 So I went to NIH because I was like, look, this guy is my god.
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000 And like, I want to be like that, right?
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000 I want to be the best surgeon scientist that ever lived.
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000 And then I got there and I realized that surgery and science couldn't be more different.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:44.000 Surgery is the ultimate immediate gratification. Like, surgery, you get to fix the problem in hours.
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000 Science is a lifetime of work.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000 A lifetime of failure before success is in fact one of the most remarkable stories from Rosenberg's book,
01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000 which of course I read while in medical school, but it wasn't until a decade later when I'm living it that I really understood why he was great
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:10.000 and why I couldn't be great was when he arrived at NIH in 1974 until he really had his first success was about 10 years.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000 So for 10 years everything he was trying was failing and every patient died.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.000 Every single person that showed up died until this one woman in 1984.
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.000 When finally they figured out how to do something called interlucantoo and they finally sort of cracked the first piece of what has turned into a very long code.
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000 That 30 years later we're just starting to make really amazing traction on.
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000 Now think about that for a second.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000 43 years ago he started that job for 10 straight years he just lost.
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000 It's like you're going to go pay pickup every day for 10 years and lose every day.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000 So what I realized was actually I don't have that intestinal fortitude.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:07.000 I cannot fail that frequently and still be at my best the next day.
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000 And again I hated knitting that because it sounds awful.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000 It sounds like I'm a sock and I guess I suck but I realized like I could be good.
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.000 I mean I could go after easier problems to solve where you can like you know get grants and you know just play the game and that's frankly what most people do in this space.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:37.000 But if you want to like change the game if you want to change mankind if you want to do something seminal you have to be willing to fail forever.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.000 And I realized like I don't I find that ups again it's not that I'm addicted to the win it's not like oh I have to be told good boy good boy good boy but I need some win.
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000 I need to know that I have some control over my fate whereas in surgery you have some control over your fate.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:00.000 You know there is a difference between being a good surgeon and being a bad surgeon and it's not to say there's not a good scientist and a great scientist but in science.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000 You are far less in control of what's going on than in surgery.
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.000 Now he must have had some long term vision hypothesis that he absolutely believed it.
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000 He laid it out he said there are four things that have to be true if we're going to ever figure out a way to get the immune system to fight cancer.
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.000 These four things have to be true and if they're not true the immune system will never be able to fight cancer.
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000 And it took ten years just to figure out the first proof of concept in a human.
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000 So yes they had a couple of successes in mice where they had demonstrated okay like at least in mice you can do this.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.000 But in cancer biology you know you don't get terribly excited about doing stuff in mice for very long.
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:50.000 You know there's a really famous Italian cancer biologist who once famously said if you can't cure cancer in a mouse you need a new profession.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000 That's that's pretty low hanging fruit you got to be able to do it in people.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000 Oh, at the it was while you were there that you decide you weren't didn't want to go into medicine anymore.
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000 So that's complicated right so then I still you're still.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000 I was still in the midterm residency so what I so then I went back to Hopkins to finish my surgical training.
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000 But then I decided you know what I think I might actually go into cardiac surgery which I'd always been interested in.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000 So when I was in medical school I was really torn between cancer surgery and cardiac surgery.
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.000 And you know to go into cancer surgery I think the real focus is going to be on research.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000 Like you want to you have to be involved in science and and surgery whereas I thought in cardiac surgery.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000 You know it's just pretty much the coolest surgery like it's the most technically demanding surgery by far.
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:45.000 I shouldn't say by far and I think there are other things that are partly on part technically but I was like I also came back in the mindset of you know what I'm just going to.
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:51.000 So become like a great technician right I just and I loved operate I mean the heart is.
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000 And one sense the simplest organ in the body like it's really simple to understand what it's doing you know unlike the brain or the liver where it's just like.
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:07.000 Ten layers of complexity like that we kind of know what's going on with the heart and when it comes to operating on it you know it's all a mechanical problem like you know this valve doesn't work oh this pipe doesn't work oh this isn't.
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:17.000 But that was sort of my concession of well you know what you don't have to be the best surgeon scientist why don't you just be the best surgeon.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000 Because they are you're more in control right that's that's now just a function of how hard you want to work.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:31.000 And that was that was that was sort of right at my alley and so then how did that path then drift you don't want to do any of this anymore.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000 You know I think over the next couple of years I mean just a couple of things changed I mean one was.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:49.000 You know I wasn't getting frustrated with these patients that we were talking about earlier wasn't the trauma patients that were getting me there was something else that was getting me that was much more frustrating which was the entire system.
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000 It seemed like everything we did was.
01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:07.000 Last ditch effort to put incredible resources into a person's life at the very end and we didn't really move the needle that much right so.
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:17.000 It just seemed like a broken system on the other end of the spectrum there's something else that did strike me as broken which actually contrasts or contradicts a little bit of what I said earlier.
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:25.000 I did feel that there was a subtle difference in the quality of residents. Some of the others this guy Chris Sond and day who's like the best resident that ever lived.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000 You know I think I was a good resident I think the most of the really good residents but there were others that just you know they were good but they weren't great.
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:39.000 And the thing about residency that really bugged me and I think part of this was I was watching my brother who was a lawyer.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:49.000 So he came out a law school when I came out of medical school like we were the same time and so I start residency when he starts this law practice or he joined like this law firm.
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:59.000 And I remember seeing that it was a totally different world like their promotions seemed more merit based like they went up the ranks.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:08.000 They got bonuses like all these things happened that were a function of some of my brother was like you know he was like breaking every record at his law firm right like nobody could work as hard.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:17.000 Nobody could build as many hours like nobody could like crush it like he could and he was being rewarded for it now he ended up hating it he left he's now a public defender or he's prosecutor rather.
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:30.000 So you know takes a huge pay cut to go and become a prosecutor because that's what he really wanted to do but the point is he could have risen all the way up that chain and I remember thinking in residency I'm like we all get paid the same we all take the same number years to get through.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:40.000 It seems crazy to me like there's no other system where this would be the case like I couldn't think of another system where you just had this complete total lack of meritocracy.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:51.000 It was really hard to get fired from residency like I saw some real knuckleheads do some real stupid things I never actually saw anybody get fired which is not say you couldn't sure you could.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:19.000 But I felt like I was working a lot harder than was necessary because I just wanted to be better and I thought got it still crazy this is going to take this many years to get through so so that and I also there's just a whole bunch of things about the system structurally that I thought were completely broken and then on the other side I just felt like health care was completely broken as a system right we have this idea yeah.
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:33.000 I don't remember the exact stats but you're going to spend like you know 50 60% of your entire health care dollars and like the last year or two of your life I mean something as an I right and so at the time.
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:47.000 Life said to me you know you are clearly upset about this system I think you have two choices you should either fix the system or leave it.
01:33:47.000 --> 01:34:02.000 What you're doing now which is staying in the system and not changing it will probably not be sustainable and so I think the toughest decision I ever made was at that point because I'm 30.
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:25.000 I've been 32 33 I've invested 10 years into this and I'm thinking I want to do over I want to complete do over which you know everybody knows that the sunk cost fallacy is called the sunk cost fallacy for a reason but it's still a damn compelling reason to keep doing something.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:43.000 So that was like it that was a super difficult time and you know in part you sort of feel like you're letting your mentors down because a lot of people had invested a lot in me right Hopkins had taken me right year I was like one of the six chosen ones they only take six categoricals a year so now you're going to leave that program.
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:54.000 And there were you know a couple of attendings I'd become really close to who really believed in me and really said like you're going to you're going to do something really special and then to say actually I'm going to leave.
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000 And I'm not even going to be a doctor anymore I'm just going to go in.
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000 So then you roll straight to McKenzie.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:12.000 So what I wanted to do is actually go back and get an MBA because I really the other thing I missed a lot in medicine was I missed quantitative.
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:26.000 Stuff like I missed math like I missed being an engineer and a few times I tried to bring that into medicine I got spanked right so the you know it's one story I think I've talked about this maybe on a podcast before I don't think so though.
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:46.000 I was like probably my first or second year in the ICU taking care of this patient and this patient's on a very very toxic drug called gentimizing this is a drug that has to be dosed very carefully so if you give too much of it you can destroy their hearing permanently and destroy their kidneys permanently if you don't give enough of it the bacteria that you're trying to kill will kill them.
01:35:46.000 --> 01:36:04.000 So you're you're you have a very narrow range in which to give the dose so there is no standard dose. It's not like oh just take 875 milligrams of this every 12 hours now it's take a first guess based on the patient's body weight so this many milligrams per kilogram give it to them and then measure a level and then.
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000 Once the level comes below a certain point give it again.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:20.000 And I remember thinking that doesn't even make sense like surely we know enough about the kinetics of this drug that we could build a mathematical model to predict when to give it.
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:32.000 So I looked up you know a couple of papers a couple of books one night on call sure enough I find like there's a very predictable alpha and beta decay cycle for this drug.
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:43.000 Like literally in Excel I build a model that uses a very simple differential equation and it needs a few inputs and it will predict the kinetic curve of this and I'm like alright let's try it out.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000 So take one of my patients going to be on gentimizing.
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.000 I do everything the standard way but I plug my numbers into the model to see would my model have predicted this better and better in the answer was unquestionably.
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:05.000 So now I start to give a little confident in the idea so like the next night I'm like alright I'm actually going to start dosing the patient based on the model which never puts the patient in jeopardy because you're always going to check the level before you dose.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:16.000 But you're going to do so at the exact right moment and so my model predicted like at 431 a m this patient will nader which means that's when you need to dose them.
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:25.000 So sure enough at like 4 in the morning I get the pass the nurse to draw the patient's blood to confirm they're just about to nader we're going to redo some in a way we go.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:34.000 So the next morning on rounds you know in the ICU you round is a big team I'm presenting that you know this patient is one of my patients and I start explaining that.
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:41.000 Okay so the patient received their dose of gentimizing at 430 in the morning and the attending says well what do you mean 430 morning we never dose gentim at 430 in the morning.
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.000 We dose it at 7 a.m always and I'm like yeah yeah but the patient hit their nader at 430.
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.000 It's like I don't care you know and so we got into this huge fight and like you know I almost got fired.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000 That would have got me fired by the way.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000 Find me someone gets fired.
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000 Find me someone gets fired.
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:10.000 And so I mean that pissed me off beyond words right it pissed me off that like it just struck me as so anti intellectual.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:20.000 Like maybe my model wasn't perfect I we never know but the fact that nobody even cared to say is there a better way to do this that drove me that shit crazy.
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:29.000 And and that's just one of many stories like that that happened through residency where I was like it's almost like we want to live in the 1950s here.
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.000 And so so you have that sort of pain of problem solving is not valued.
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000 At least it didn't seem valued to me was valued in the lab but I had decided now I'm not going to be in the lab.
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:52.000 So here I live in this world where problem solving is not valued and I don't actually I'm not a quantity more like I don't do math anymore and I really loved math.
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:03.000 So I started so tutoring kids in math I made like a little bit of free time so I could like tutor high school kids in calculus just like at my calculus on again.
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:17.000 Missing it but it wasn't the same so so then I was like you know maybe I'll go back and get an MBA so I looked into that didn't feel like I was already drowning in debt at that point in time you know you've got med school debt is sort of painful.
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.000 And you know residency you're making I think of the time I'm making about 34,000 bucks a year so it's you're not even putting a dent in your 200,000 dollar debt sort of thing.
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:38.000 So so then I remember one night I was in I was on call and I was really pissed to be on call this night this and I you can relate to this better than I'll ever be able to relate to it because I'm sure this happened to you your whole life but.
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000 My best friend from high school tells me in February he's getting married that August and I'm the best man.
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000 He lives in Toronto.
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:55.000 So he's like this is the day to my wife for you. It was like August fifth it's a Saturday. I want you to be the best man completely honored.
01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000 So I tell my program director in February. Can I not be on call.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000 That day or the day before.
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000 I just need to I need to be able to fly out of Baltimore in a Friday and come back on a Sunday and he's like hey that's no problem.
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.000 I remind him three times no problem no problem sure enough the call schedule comes out I'm on call Saturday.
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000 I'm on call the day of the guy's wedding.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:31.000 He got to be kidding me. So it's two o'clock in that morning. I'm down in the ER looking at a chest CT scan on a guy who I'm worried has it was called a dissecting a order.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:42.000 And the radiologist. I introduced myself and she's very nice and she walks me through the CT scan and we just start shooting the breeze a little bit.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.000 She says oh yeah you seem kind of down tonight what's up and I was like I am just kind of pissed off. I mean which I wasn't here blah blah blah.
01:40:48.000 --> 01:41:00.000 And she's like yeah I can I can relate I used to be in a surgical residency myself and I was like oh really she goes yeah yeah I did my internship in surgery at the university of Seattle and I just hated it so much that I left and actually joined this company called McKinsey.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:13.000 You know work there for two years but then decided I wanted to come back to medicine but I wanted to do it in a kind or gentler way so that's why I'm back here doing radiology and I was like oh what's this McKinsey thing? I never heard of it.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:29.000 And so she told me all about it and I was like huh that sounds interesting how do I apply you know and that was sort of the beginning of it so she introduced me to some folks and you know then I had to like study all over again because the way they interview it these consulting firms is very specific.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.000 You can be the smartest dude in the world if you show up and you haven't thought through how to solve a case.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:52.000 Like what are called these case interviews you're gonna flail so you have to actually put in some like work and study so I you know got a bunch of books on case interviews and I'd be sitting in the trauma bay waiting for bodies to come in I'd be like reading my cases you know case interview things before so that that's that was sort of the transition.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:04.000 You walk you walk away from medicine you go into so we do in medicine specific consulting so I think it's rooted to do that because McKinsey.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:10.000 And I'm sure this is true of like Bane and BCG which are kind of the other two really big.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:20.000 Management consulting firms. They recruit about a third of their consultants who out of sort of what we call non typical or a typical rather.
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:30.000 Backgrounds of people who have PhDs or JDs or MDs but who didn't go to business school and then so they send you off to do business school that summer they do this thing called a mini MBA which was.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:42.000 I mean it was like being a kid in a candy store again because I got to go spend a whole summer in school again learning finance like learning all of these things that you know for some people might seem kind of drive but when you're like just dying to.
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000 Get back into numbers.
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:53.000 I was like oh my god like you know I remember the first time we learned what was called the efficient front here which is basically this differential equation that describes you know an investment philosophy.
01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:01.000 I can't believe I'm doing this again. I can't believe it. So so then we show up for orientation.
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000 I'm in San Francisco at this time. That was the other thing. I wanted to get back to California.
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:19.000 So I was like you know San Francisco please. So during the first drink during orientation week I was approached by one of the staffers there and they said hey you know your background looks like you've done a lot of mathematics.
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:37.000 Yeah they said well you know we know you're a physician and you're probably here to work on you know that all the medical teams are going to try to grab you to have you work on some biotech thing or whatever but we have this banking issue that is very important to some of our clients and it requires you know an ability to do stochastic calculus.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:44:04.000 I was like of course and so then you know that was basically the beginning and I never really stopped doing that stuff. So so I ended up doing what's called credit risk modeling which then which started out around this thing called the Basel 2 Accord which was a type of this was a regulation that came out in the mid 2000s that required banks to hold a certain amount of capital against unexpected losses.
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:12.000 So banks have a long history of knowing how to hold capital for expected losses but they don't really know what to do for unexpected losses.
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000 And in particular the problem that was damning was something called asset value correlations.
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:28.000 So if you're a bank you could have 27 lines of business. You do first mortgage, second mortgage auto, student credit card like you name it.
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:40.000 And the problem is nobody really understood how those assets correlated. So if your loss rate is x in this what's the probability that it impacts the loss rate in that.
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000 So where that where the rubber meets the road is if I can't make my house payment I'm probably not making my car payment either.
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000 That's right.
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000 That's what nobody got to realize everything went down.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:07.000 Oh yeah. So that turned into as we were in the midst of that because the banks used to leverage themselves so much that they could well in when the market crashed they weren't ready for they couldn't handle it.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000 You know it's such an I mean it's like literally one of my favorite topics actually which I'm sure your listeners don't want to get bored to tears on it.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:33.000 But the first of all the best movie of all the movies that have like tried to explain what's going on the big short by far does the best job because it actually explains the the sequence of events that went that took this from being just an isolated problem to a systemic problem.
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:44.000 Most people miss the subtlety of how this thing ceased to be contained. Because technically a housing crisis shouldn't have affected the global economy.
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:53.000 So it was these instruments called CDOs that effectively allowed this problem to become enormous.
01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:09.000 But at the time the bigger issue was, you know just a great example of hubris that exists everywhere, right, which is one we don't like looking at data that contradict our point of view.
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:22.000 And we're all guilty of this. I'm guilty of this. I find myself doing it and I actually am now quite a muse. I'm so attuned to it now that I'm quite a muse. Like if I'm flipping through Twitter, I'll see a story that is completely against how I feel and I don't want to read it.
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:33.000 And I'm like the next one will be like exactly how I feel, I want to read it. And I'm like, dude, look what you just did man. You've got to stop pull back, go up assume you are wrong and keep going and try to figure out if you're.
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:47.000 But so so at the at the banking level, I mean, and we you know the the canary in the call mine here, well, there were many, but in 2000s early 2006 to 1000 yeah mid 2006.
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:57.000 We had when we were trying to do these asset value correlations, one of the biggest problems we had is we couldn't we only had 10 years of data.
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:04.000 The banks only had this data recorded for 10 years. We didn't have losses to model.
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:15.000 And I remember saying to like, you know the controller at this bank, I'm like, hey man, like it's going to be really hard to build you a model of losses when you don't have any historical losses.
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:24.000 And he goes, well, that's mortgage is mortgage is can't lose money. Right. So that was and we can laugh at that now, but at the time that was like not an unreasonable point of view.
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:37.000 Right. Like you can't lose money on a first mortgage. Think about it. You got to put 20% down. You want to buy home for 100 grand. You better show up with 20. You better be able to document. You have a job. You better do this. You better do that. You better that.
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:49.000 So you now the banks only on the hook for 80 on a home that's been legitimately appraised for 100 and you've shown documentation. So you're at least going to pay that thing down to 70 such that worst case scenario.
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000 Market falls by 10% houses worth 90. You lose your job. Guess who still gets paid.
01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000 The bank is still get their 70. Sure, if you're in the business of creating a second mortgage, you take a little bit more risk.
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:09.000 But there's no reason you should have been losing money on first mortgages. And so you fast forward a year.
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000 Well, especially because don't worry about the value of the house because that's going to go up.
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000 That's right. So we're good to go.
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:24.000 Oh, well, that's where I remember even when I was in Baltimore, one of my buddies because you know, the residents were always looking for a way to make a buck on the side, right. When you're making 34k.
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:32.000 You got it. You got to come up with the only saving grace as you can't spend money. Like your clothes is free. You're inscrubs all the time.
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.000 You're kind of eating for free all the time because you eat off the patients trays, whatever they didn't finish.
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.000 Like go to the nurses station, eat all this crap. So I didn't actually spend much money.
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:56.000 You just... pens was like the only thing I wasted money on. Like I collect mollongs. And so even through residents here, I would still buy these beautiful pens.
01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.000 So yeah, I remember one of my buddies being like dude, we got to start buying houses in Baltimore because like there's so cheap and you can get them with no money down.
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000 You could buy a house for 200,000 bucks, put like $5,000 down.
01:49:08.12 --> 01:49:13.24 If that house goes up to 220, you just made 25,
01:49:13.24 --> 01:49:14.92 okay, you made 20, okay, on your five.
01:49:14.92 --> 01:49:16.36 We're going all the way.
01:49:16.36 --> 01:49:20.68 And no one does the math of what if it goes down to 190?
01:49:20.68 --> 01:49:23.88 You just lost everything, right?
01:49:23.88 --> 01:49:28.88 So luckily, I didn't get in any of those sweetheart deals.
01:49:28.88 --> 01:49:30.56 Although, you know, if you'd time them right,
01:49:30.56 --> 01:49:31.84 there were a lot of people did make a lot of money
01:49:31.84 --> 01:49:33.52 and those deals before the shoe fell.
01:49:33.52 --> 01:49:37.32 So when things started to become clear,
01:49:37.32 --> 01:49:42.32 so in early, in early O7, it became clear,
01:49:43.92 --> 01:49:47.64 subprime mortgages were going to be a problem.
01:49:47.64 --> 01:49:52.40 By August of O7, a very famous,
01:49:52.40 --> 01:49:54.72 then famous analyst,
01:49:54.72 --> 01:49:59.000 it's her name, Meredith, Whitney, I believe,
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.68 is her name, I think she's an opera called something
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:05.92 that the time seemed crazy.
01:50:05.92 --> 01:50:09.20 She said, city group is going to cut its dividend next month.
01:50:09.20 --> 01:50:10.60 So for city group, you know,
01:50:10.60 --> 01:50:12.60 one of the largest banks in the country
01:50:12.60 --> 01:50:16.08 to not pay a dividend for Q3 seemed impossible.
01:50:16.08 --> 01:50:17.84 But she'd done the math, she's like, yeah, there's no way.
01:50:17.84 --> 01:50:21.32 They're getting crushed on these mortgage back securities.
01:50:21.32 --> 01:50:22.92 And everyone was like, she doesn't know,
01:50:22.92 --> 01:50:25.64 she's talking about, sure enough, Q3 comes along,
01:50:25.64 --> 01:50:28.44 city cuts its dividend, Chuck prints the CEO
01:50:28.44 --> 01:50:30.16 of city gets fired.
01:50:30.16 --> 01:50:32.16 And at that point, it's like, God damn.
01:50:32.16 --> 01:50:36.000 But again, everybody was still thinking,
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.80 this is just a subprime problem.
01:50:37.80 --> 01:50:40.88 It's an inch wide and yet some mild deep, but it's an inch wide.
01:50:40.88 --> 01:50:43.96 Well, in a background, we're working on another problem,
01:50:43.96 --> 01:50:45.76 which is prime mortgages.
01:50:45.76 --> 01:50:48.60 That which everybody thinks is totally fine.
01:50:48.60 --> 01:50:50.52 That which has a historical default ratio
01:50:50.52 --> 01:50:52.68 of less than half a percent.
01:50:52.68 --> 01:50:55.48 And we're seeing in the data,
01:50:55.48 --> 01:50:58.52 the data that was right in front of this bank the whole time,
01:50:58.52 --> 01:51:02.40 oh, there's a tsunami coming.
01:51:02.40 --> 01:51:05.44 Your default rate's going to hit four, five percent,
01:51:05.44 --> 01:51:07.36 which again, that might not sound like a lot.
01:51:07.36 --> 01:51:09.64 That's 10 times your default rate.
01:51:09.64 --> 01:51:11.92 It's going to be actually higher than that as we learned.
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:15.32 And your loss given a default is going up much higher.
01:51:15.32 --> 01:51:18.68 So loss is actually the dot product
01:51:18.68 --> 01:51:22.08 of probability of default and loss given default.
01:51:22.08 --> 01:51:24.28 Okay, you guys are my only two customers.
01:51:24.28 --> 01:51:28.68 Probability you default is 50% probability you defaults 10%.
01:51:28.68 --> 01:51:31.88 If you default, you will lose 100,000.
01:51:31.88 --> 01:51:33.88 So it's 10% times 100,000.
01:51:33.88 --> 01:51:36.04 I expect to lose 10,000 on you.
01:51:36.04 --> 01:51:38.16 If you default, it's 2000.
01:51:38.16 --> 01:51:40.76 So 50% times 2000.
01:51:40.76 --> 01:51:43.64 So my total expected loss is 11,000.
01:51:43.64 --> 01:51:46.96 So this is, you know, you do this 88 million times
01:51:46.96 --> 01:51:48.60 for every account you have.
01:51:48.60 --> 01:51:50.36 And the model to predict probability
01:51:50.36 --> 01:51:52.68 to fault and loss given to fault are enormous models
01:51:52.68 --> 01:51:54.48 that each have 50 variables in them.
01:51:54.48 --> 01:51:57.000 Actually, the PD does the LGD doesn't.
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000 But what people didn't realize is the loss given
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.84 to faults were skyrocketing.
01:52:00.84 --> 01:52:04.40 It was like, in fact, again, at the level of just
01:52:04.40 --> 01:52:05.72 being kind of a math idiot.
01:52:05.72 --> 01:52:10.32 Like that to me was so amazing to watch.
01:52:10.32 --> 01:52:12.40 It was like, holy shit.
01:52:12.40 --> 01:52:14.48 Watch these LGDs go.
01:52:14.48 --> 01:52:15.92 They're just like blowing up.
01:52:15.92 --> 01:52:19.60 And then you knew once the PD triggered,
01:52:19.60 --> 01:52:21.92 meaning once the probability of default went,
01:52:21.92 --> 01:52:27.36 oh, it was going to become a non-linear catastrophe.
01:52:27.36 --> 01:52:30.48 And it turned out so November 15,
01:52:30.48 --> 01:52:32.84 Thursday, November 15, 2007,
01:52:32.84 --> 01:52:35.40 was kind of the day like that was the matrix moment.
01:52:35.40 --> 01:52:37.12 So I had a team, great example.
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:38.84 I was able to be a leader for once,
01:52:38.84 --> 01:52:40.64 because I had an amazing team.
01:52:40.64 --> 01:52:43.52 I had a team in San Francisco of four people.
01:52:43.52 --> 01:52:46.32 I had a team in India of four guys.
01:52:46.32 --> 01:52:49.96 We worked around the clock 16 hours a day, every day,
01:52:49.96 --> 01:52:52.92 except Sundays we took off, and we would pass the model
01:52:52.92 --> 01:52:54.40 back and forth through each other.
01:52:54.40 --> 01:52:54.96 Amazing.
01:52:54.96 --> 01:52:59.32 It was pure bliss to be working that hard on this problem.
01:52:59.32 --> 01:53:02.68 And on that day, we basically came up with four independent
01:53:02.68 --> 01:53:06.92 models that all predicted how bad this thing was going to be.
01:53:06.92 --> 01:53:11.28 And we presented it to the leadership of this bank.
01:53:11.28 --> 01:53:13.24 And it's really funny.
01:53:13.24 --> 01:53:14.92 I was a manager.
01:53:14.92 --> 01:53:18.56 So it McKinsey, you have these levels like Analyst Associate
01:53:18.56 --> 01:53:21.20 Manager, Junior Partner, Partner Director.
01:53:21.20 --> 01:53:24.40 For a meeting of that stature, meaning you're talking
01:53:24.40 --> 01:53:25.76 to the entire leadership of the bank,
01:53:25.76 --> 01:53:28.56 the senior partner would only be the one to predict.
01:53:28.56 --> 01:53:30.96 I'd be in the corner, work in the PowerPoint,
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:33.44 answering a question if piped up,
01:53:33.44 --> 01:53:35.08 because there's going to be a technical question.
01:53:35.08 --> 01:53:37.84 But the senior partner would do all the talking.
01:53:37.84 --> 01:53:39.40 But on that day, we go into the meeting
01:53:39.40 --> 01:53:42.44 and the senior partner says, Peter, you should present this.
01:53:42.44 --> 01:53:43.80 And I said, are you short?
01:53:43.80 --> 01:53:46.44 Because I'm like the third most junior guy in the room here.
01:53:46.44 --> 01:53:49.44 And he said, yeah, two reasons, one, you're the only one
01:53:49.44 --> 01:53:51.88 who actually understands how all of these models work.
01:53:51.88 --> 01:53:53.28 And this is the funniest thing he said.
01:53:53.28 --> 01:53:56.44 He goes to, because of all of your experience
01:53:56.44 --> 01:54:00.12 with cancer patients, you're going to be very good
01:54:00.12 --> 01:54:04.88 at answering hard questions about bad things happening.
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:06.20 And I was like, OK.
01:54:06.20 --> 01:54:11.40 So I stepped in and I did my best to be empathetic and non-judgmental
01:54:11.40 --> 01:54:14.48 and just as evidence, fact-based as I could.
01:54:14.48 --> 01:54:15.48 And this is what this says.
01:54:15.48 --> 01:54:17.52 And this is what you look at the run-right model
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:20.20 and the PGD says this and the LGD says this.
01:54:20.20 --> 01:54:22.24 And the vintage model says this.
01:54:22.24 --> 01:54:26.40 And so finally, like the president of the bank says,
01:54:26.40 --> 01:54:29.48 how much money are we going to lose?
01:54:29.48 --> 01:54:31.68 Like she was kind of like, you know, like all good leaders.
01:54:31.68 --> 01:54:35.28 She's just like, just get to tell me the goddamn answer first.
01:54:35.28 --> 01:54:38.04 So I said, I had to think on my feet
01:54:38.04 --> 01:54:40.44 like pretty quickly about a way to put it in terms.
01:54:40.44 --> 01:54:44.32 So I said, you're going to lose more money
01:54:44.32 --> 01:54:50.76 in the next 18 months than you've made in the last 10 years.
01:54:50.76 --> 01:54:53.28 And see the Jaco answer to that question?
01:54:53.28 --> 01:54:55.20 How much money were we going to lose?
01:54:55.20 --> 01:54:56.56 Would have been all of it.
01:55:00.96 --> 01:55:03.16 That's the difference between you and me on Twitter.
01:55:03.16 --> 01:55:06.64 Like you always have the best answer.
01:55:06.64 --> 01:55:07.28 Like always.
01:55:07.28 --> 01:55:09.32 Because that would be like, hey, Jaco,
01:55:09.32 --> 01:55:10.44 like you just picture that on Twitter.
01:55:10.44 --> 01:55:12.48 Like, you know, see you of like the bank.
01:55:12.48 --> 01:55:14.28 Hey, Jaco, how much money were you going to do?
01:55:14.28 --> 01:55:15.76 All of it.
01:55:15.76 --> 01:55:18.04 Peter, one of three.
01:55:18.04 --> 01:55:21.04 Well, start with your event last year.
01:55:21.04 --> 01:55:22.92 Multiply that by two of them.
01:55:22.92 --> 01:55:25.20 Three of three.
01:55:25.20 --> 01:55:26.20 Three of three.
01:55:26.20 --> 01:55:27.20 Yeah.
01:55:27.20 --> 01:55:29.56 Did they listen to you at all?
01:55:29.56 --> 01:55:30.56 Yeah.
01:55:30.56 --> 01:55:31.68 They want to leave that data.
01:55:31.68 --> 01:55:32.68 They did that was impossible.
01:55:32.68 --> 01:55:35.44 That was impossible to fathom years later.
01:55:35.44 --> 01:55:37.36 Because I had it by this point left McKinsey.
01:55:37.36 --> 01:55:40.16 But I stayed in close touch with that team.
01:55:40.16 --> 01:55:43.000 And I reached back out to that senior partner
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.16 who actually ran still very close with he had just got
01:55:45.16 --> 01:55:47.40 a meal from him two days ago.
01:55:47.40 --> 01:55:49.92 I said, hey, man, remember all those models?
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:51.12 Yeah, yeah.
01:55:51.12 --> 01:55:53.80 Did we, were we roughly close?
01:55:53.80 --> 01:55:58.96 And he goes, oh, no, the models underestimated by a third.
01:55:58.96 --> 01:56:01.12 I mean, it was like, it seemed like we kept trying
01:56:01.12 --> 01:56:02.32 to tone the models down.
01:56:02.32 --> 01:56:03.64 Because they kept giving us these answers.
01:56:03.64 --> 01:56:08.56 And we were like, damn, like there's no way it can be this bad.
01:56:08.56 --> 01:56:10.24 And we were like, oh, let's make this assumption
01:56:10.24 --> 01:56:11.04 more conservative.
01:56:11.04 --> 01:56:12.04 And let's do this.
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:15.12 You know, in the end, it was like, no, it was actually that bad.
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:16.12 Brutal.
01:56:16.12 --> 01:56:19.60 So then now I remember, I saw you tell a story one time.
01:56:19.60 --> 01:56:21.40 It's on YouTube somewhere.
01:56:21.40 --> 01:56:24.88 But you're talking about a patient you were working on.
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:27.12 You kind of alluded to this earlier.
01:56:27.12 --> 01:56:30.72 Either pre-diabetic or diabetic and you're sitting there
01:56:30.72 --> 01:56:32.60 going, you got to be kidding me.
01:56:32.60 --> 01:56:34.68 Because the day before you tried to save someone's life,
01:56:34.68 --> 01:56:36.72 that was a young kid.
01:56:36.72 --> 01:56:39.24 And that was sort of the first time that you started thinking
01:56:39.24 --> 01:56:45.000 about nutrition as an earlier, you talked about, hey,
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.32 we do all this stuff at the end of life.
01:56:46.32 --> 01:56:49.56 It's all this prevention to prevent someone from actually dying.
01:56:49.56 --> 01:56:52.20 But if we would have invested some of that money up front,
01:56:52.20 --> 01:56:55.64 taught these people out of eat, we would have been better off.
01:56:55.64 --> 01:56:58.04 Is that sort of where it came from or not at all?
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:00.84 I mean, I never made that connection at back time.
01:57:00.84 --> 01:57:03.12 So at that time, it was just what you describe.
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:07.84 It was just the visceral reaction of, I'm so angry at you.
01:57:07.84 --> 01:57:10.80 How can you not take care of yourself?
01:57:10.80 --> 01:57:15.20 How can you be sitting here so fat, so diabetic?
01:57:15.20 --> 01:57:19.84 Over and over again, you come in here to have these ulcers
01:57:19.84 --> 01:57:22.92 debreed and to have these things amputated.
01:57:22.92 --> 01:57:24.68 And you know how the story is going to go.
01:57:24.68 --> 01:57:25.68 Just get it together.
01:57:25.68 --> 01:57:29.48 So this was, I didn't say those words, but that's how I'm feeling.
01:57:29.48 --> 01:57:35.96 And so that's just part of the callousness
01:57:35.96 --> 01:57:38.84 that developed towards that subset of patient.
01:57:38.84 --> 01:57:47.36 It wasn't until probably 2009, so I'm out of medicine now.
01:57:47.36 --> 01:57:49.16 But I was becoming overweight.
01:57:49.16 --> 01:57:50.84 And I was pre-diabetic.
01:57:50.84 --> 01:57:51.48 I wasn't diabetic.
01:57:51.48 --> 01:57:53.16 I was pre-diabetic.
01:57:53.16 --> 01:57:56.44 And I was, you know, that I was sort of a comphal circle.
01:57:56.44 --> 01:57:57.60 That I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:57:57.60 --> 01:57:58.72 I do everything right.
01:57:58.72 --> 01:58:01.40 I mean, I'm swimming four hours a day.
01:58:01.40 --> 01:58:04.84 I'm following that goddamn food pyramid to the core.
01:58:04.84 --> 01:58:06.80 I don't need saturated fat.
01:58:06.80 --> 01:58:10.60 I'm like, you know, I, I carb load like a band sheet.
01:58:10.60 --> 01:58:14.40 Like, why am I, why is all this stuff happening to me?
01:58:14.40 --> 01:58:18.44 And so then when I, you know, went through my whole discovery
01:58:18.44 --> 01:58:21.92 process of figuring that out, it was only then that I really
01:58:21.92 --> 01:58:27.32 thought back and reflected upon, you know, the horrible way I had
01:58:27.32 --> 01:58:30.20 treated, not just that patient, particularly, but obviously
01:58:30.20 --> 01:58:32.40 many other patients like her.
01:58:32.40 --> 01:58:34.80 I remember her case specifically, because it was probably
01:58:34.80 --> 01:58:39.60 like the absolute low point of my existence.
01:58:39.60 --> 01:58:45.36 So it, unfortunately, it took me sort of failing on my own,
01:58:45.36 --> 01:58:48.32 because at least then I could say this isn't a well-power problem.
01:58:48.32 --> 01:58:49.72 It's not like you don't care.
01:58:49.72 --> 01:58:52.000 It's not like you're not trying.
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.16 You're doing what you're told to do and you're failing miserably.
01:58:55.16 --> 01:59:00.44 So either you're an outlier or maybe the advice is incorrect.
01:59:00.44 --> 01:59:02.60 So you're eating what you're being told to eat.
01:59:02.60 --> 01:59:06.68 You're car bloating and you're still getting fat.
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:06.68 Yeah.
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:08.60 Even though, in, at this time, you're swimming.
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:10.24 We were just talking about it before the podcast.
01:59:10.24 --> 01:59:14.44 You're doing ultra long swims, dozens of miles worth of
01:59:14.44 --> 01:59:17.68 swimming, which, by the way, in seal training, in basic
01:59:17.68 --> 01:59:20.28 seal training, the longest you swim is five and a half
01:59:20.28 --> 01:59:24.52 nautical miles, which is six point two statute miles, which,
01:59:24.52 --> 01:59:26.36 and that's with swim fins on.
01:59:26.36 --> 01:59:28.52 So you're out there in the, and you're out there in the open
01:59:28.52 --> 01:59:33.08 ocean swimming, 12, 15, 18 miles at a time.
01:59:33.08 --> 01:59:36.28 And you're training for that, working hard, and you're
01:59:36.28 --> 01:59:40.92 quote-unquote eating right because you're not eating saturated fat.
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:43.56 And yet you're getting fat, you go into the doctor,
01:59:43.56 --> 01:59:45.80 you get blooddred test, and they say, oh, yeah, by the way,
01:59:45.80 --> 01:59:47.48 you're pre-diabetic.
01:59:47.48 --> 01:59:49.96 And you just say to yourself, what is going on?
01:59:49.96 --> 01:59:53.08 Yeah, and truth be told, I was actually more pissed just
01:59:53.08 --> 01:59:55.88 from the vanity standpoint at being fat.
01:59:55.88 --> 01:59:58.20 I mean, I wish I could say that.
01:59:58.20 --> 01:59:59.64 If you're not, if you're losing it on the podcast,
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:02.44 echo is not, if you're too enthusiastic, we did that.
02:00:02.44 --> 02:00:06.04 I mean, I wish I could say, oh, it didn't bother me to be fat.
02:00:06.04 --> 02:00:07.16 It did bother me to be fat.
02:00:07.16 --> 02:00:09.48 It really bothered me to be fat, right?
02:00:09.48 --> 02:00:12.68 It bothered me.
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:14.12 It bothered me a lot, actually.
02:00:14.12 --> 02:00:17.000 And so much so that I actually wanted to get a gastric bypass.
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.76 And so I went, so right now I'm about 175.
02:00:22.76 --> 02:00:25.96 I was probably 205 to 210.
02:00:25.96 --> 02:00:28.36 So once again, after this podcast, you and I,
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:29.88 we're going to the counseling session.
02:00:29.88 --> 02:00:33.08 No, no, no, no.
02:00:33.08 --> 02:00:36.92 So I went to, I finally got my doctor to get me a referral
02:00:36.92 --> 02:00:41.000 to this guy named Ken Fujioka, who's like a very prominent
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.48 bariatric physician here in San Diego.
02:00:43.48 --> 02:00:45.08 So I finally go to see Fujioka.
02:00:45.08 --> 02:00:47.08 So I'm sitting in the waiting room.
02:00:47.08 --> 02:00:51.24 And I actually, I think I told this story on Tim's podcast.
02:00:51.24 --> 02:00:52.36 I don't remember telling you.
02:00:52.36 --> 02:00:52.92 I did tell it.
02:00:52.92 --> 02:00:55.08 But it is in the book.
02:00:55.08 --> 02:00:57.08 It's in the history of the time.
02:00:57.08 --> 02:00:58.44 It's the story of the time.
02:00:58.44 --> 02:01:01.80 So I put in the spirit of assuming nobody listens to
02:01:01.80 --> 02:01:03.16 or reads multiple of the thing.
02:01:03.16 --> 02:01:05.000 So I'm in the waiting room.
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.36 I'm finally waiting to see.
02:01:06.36 --> 02:01:07.88 And the nurse comes out.
02:01:07.88 --> 02:01:10.44 And before you go back to the clinic room,
02:01:10.44 --> 02:01:11.32 like you have to get weight.
02:01:11.32 --> 02:01:13.16 That's just part of the protocol, right?
02:01:13.16 --> 02:01:15.64 So like they call my name.
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:17.88 So I walk up and I get on the scale.
02:01:17.88 --> 02:01:20.04 And the nurse comes out and weighs me.
02:01:20.04 --> 02:01:21.80 And it's like, you know, whatever, 210.
02:01:21.80 --> 02:01:25.24 And she's like, congratulations.
02:01:25.24 --> 02:01:26.68 I'm like, what?
02:01:26.68 --> 02:01:29.40 She goes, you're post-surgery, right?
02:01:29.40 --> 02:01:33.72 And I'm like, no, I'm here to be evaluated for surgery.
02:01:33.72 --> 02:01:34.92 She looks at me.
02:01:34.92 --> 02:01:38.12 Looks out at the waiting room where everybody's 400 pounds.
02:01:38.12 --> 02:01:40.60 And like, doesn't say a word.
02:01:40.60 --> 02:01:43.96 But the look in her eyes is basically like,
02:01:43.96 --> 02:01:45.80 what the hell is wrong with you?
02:01:45.80 --> 02:01:47.16 Yeah, you got serious issues.
02:01:47.16 --> 02:01:54.20 So I'm like, it's like a reasonable idea.
02:01:54.20 --> 02:01:56.52 Well, yeah, a very reasonable, very reasonable.
02:01:56.52 --> 02:01:59.52 You might want to check your reasonable ideas with me.
02:01:59.52 --> 02:02:01.32 Future.
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:03.40 Because that is not a reasonable idea.
02:02:03.40 --> 02:02:06.52 So you don't do that surgery, obviously.
02:02:06.52 --> 02:02:07.52 But what?
02:02:07.52 --> 02:02:08.72 He, that guy had no patience for me.
02:02:08.72 --> 02:02:09.76 What clicked on your brain?
02:02:09.76 --> 02:02:11.12 Did you just, all the sudden, say to yourself,
02:02:11.12 --> 02:02:12.000 okay, how is this happening?
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.76 And then you remembered your A and P class,
02:02:14.76 --> 02:02:17.12 and said this was just what's happening?
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:19.44 I remember, clear as day.
02:02:19.44 --> 02:02:24.44 So September 7th, 2009, I did,
02:02:26.72 --> 02:02:29.04 I sort of did like one of these long swims a year.
02:02:29.04 --> 02:02:30.64 You know, you do a bunch of short ones of bunch of training.
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:32.24 But Joey's, I got how to one main event.
02:02:32.24 --> 02:02:34.28 From a main event this year was,
02:02:34.28 --> 02:02:35.84 I went back to Catalina Island,
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:39.44 and I wanted to swim from now LA out to Catalina.
02:02:39.44 --> 02:02:42.88 I had previously gone from Catalina to LA.
02:02:42.88 --> 02:02:46.40 And it was tough swim.
02:02:46.40 --> 02:02:48.000 I had a torn labrum.
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.40 So about six hours in, you know,
02:02:50.40 --> 02:02:52.80 it just became unbearable pain.
02:02:53.80 --> 02:02:58.12 And you don't usually have a head current
02:02:58.12 --> 02:02:59.20 in the Catalina channel.
02:02:59.20 --> 02:03:00.28 So the sand paid for a channel,
02:03:00.28 --> 02:03:01.88 you know this is going to be trained out there.
02:03:01.88 --> 02:03:04.64 The currents usually running from point conception down
02:03:04.64 --> 02:03:05.48 or up.
02:03:05.48 --> 02:03:07.28 So you usually have a little bit of a cross current,
02:03:07.28 --> 02:03:10.36 very rare to get anything back or forth.
02:03:10.36 --> 02:03:14.56 And if anything, it's generally a little bit towards the island.
02:03:14.56 --> 02:03:19.56 And when I had swam four years earlier from Catalina to LA,
02:03:20.08 --> 02:03:21.76 it took 10 and a half hours.
02:03:21.76 --> 02:03:25.20 But that was only 18 months after I learned how to swim.
02:03:25.20 --> 02:03:28.16 That was a much better swimmer in 2009.
02:03:28.16 --> 02:03:31.16 And I was going in the theoretically faster direction.
02:03:31.16 --> 02:03:35.44 So a great example is expectations can kill you.
02:03:35.44 --> 02:03:39.40 So I'm expecting this to be like a nine hour swim back.
02:03:39.40 --> 02:03:41.28 And really the only thing I'm thinking about,
02:03:41.28 --> 02:03:43.36 which is the worst thing you think about in marathon swimming,
02:03:43.36 --> 02:03:46.80 you should never ever think about how long this is going to take.
02:03:46.80 --> 02:03:48.84 Because you're just setting yourself up for misery.
02:03:48.84 --> 02:03:51.52 The only real question I had is could I break nine hours.
02:03:51.52 --> 02:03:53.76 I should be able to break nine hours, right?
02:03:53.76 --> 02:03:57.12 So to make a long story short, I don't even come close.
02:03:57.12 --> 02:03:59.96 This is a total disaster scenario.
02:03:59.96 --> 02:04:01.92 The other thing you want to appreciate this,
02:04:01.92 --> 02:04:04.76 just to appreciate this stupidity.
02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.68 You never want to look anywhere when you're swimming,
02:04:08.68 --> 02:04:09.52 except down.
02:04:09.52 --> 02:04:13.92 It's very demoralizing when you're in the middle.
02:04:13.92 --> 02:04:15.32 Like if you're in the middle of the channel,
02:04:15.32 --> 02:04:18.04 you don't see land from the water level.
02:04:18.04 --> 02:04:19.04 You just don't.
02:04:19.04 --> 02:04:19.56 So that's the.
02:04:19.56 --> 02:04:21.60 So before you get in the water,
02:04:21.60 --> 02:04:25.72 you tell the crew and every I've crew chief for a lot of great swimmerism.
02:04:25.72 --> 02:04:28.52 I mean, it's the crew asks the swimmer,
02:04:28.52 --> 02:04:31.84 what do you want, what information do you want?
02:04:31.84 --> 02:04:34.60 So we're starting the swim in midnight at Point Facente.
02:04:34.60 --> 02:04:39.48 I said, okay, I want to know when there are exactly 10 miles.
02:04:39.48 --> 02:04:42.32 To go and exactly four miles to go.
02:04:42.32 --> 02:04:44.12 What's the total distance of the swim?
02:04:44.12 --> 02:04:46.36 Well, as a crow flies, it's 21.
02:04:46.36 --> 02:04:49.36 And if so, if you don't have a current,
02:04:49.36 --> 02:04:50.76 you're doing a 21 miles swim.
02:04:50.76 --> 02:04:52.76 If you do have a current, you're going to swim more than that.
02:04:52.76 --> 02:04:54.60 So, so that's what I said,
02:04:54.60 --> 02:04:57.60 as a guys, I want to know when there's 10 to go and forward to go.
02:04:57.60 --> 02:04:58.12 Why?
02:04:58.12 --> 02:04:58.80 10 to go.
02:04:58.80 --> 02:05:00.28 You're just a little over half way.
02:05:00.28 --> 02:05:01.60 I'd like to just know that.
02:05:01.60 --> 02:05:04.84 At four to go, it's put your head down and swim for two hours.
02:05:04.84 --> 02:05:05.68 Don't do anything.
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:06.32 You're there.
02:05:06.32 --> 02:05:09.16 So, start the swim in midnight.
02:05:09.16 --> 02:05:10.44 This is in September.
02:05:10.44 --> 02:05:13.96 So, I forget what time the sun was rising back then.
02:05:13.96 --> 02:05:18.64 But I knew that I would have 10 to go before the sun came up.
02:05:18.64 --> 02:05:21.44 So, in other words, I knew that once the light was up,
02:05:21.44 --> 02:05:23.84 I was going to be inside the 10 stretch.
02:05:23.84 --> 02:05:27.96 And one of the most amazing things about swimming in the middle of the ocean.
02:05:27.96 --> 02:05:30.48 I don't know if you got to experience this during training is
02:05:30.48 --> 02:05:35.28 in the Pacific, the bio-luminous is so strong.
02:05:35.28 --> 02:05:38.16 And so, on a clear night, which I was always lucky to have,
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:40.64 every time I swim out, I've done a lot of the channel swims.
02:05:40.64 --> 02:05:43.92 Every time I've been out there, I've always been blessed with these clear nights.
02:05:43.92 --> 02:05:48.56 It's so dark, because once you get out of LA's light,
02:05:48.56 --> 02:05:50.84 under the water, so your hand is coming down.
02:05:50.84 --> 02:05:54.44 You are seeing the bio-luminoussins flare off your hands.
02:05:54.44 --> 02:05:56.80 When you breathe, you are seeing the stars.
02:05:56.80 --> 02:05:58.60 You can't tell the difference.
02:05:58.60 --> 02:05:59.88 It is so dark.
02:05:59.88 --> 02:06:02.88 You cannot see the difference between stars and bio-luminoussins.
02:06:02.88 --> 02:06:04.72 It's like being in this amazing chamber.
02:06:04.72 --> 02:06:08.92 And so, that's the reward you get for swimming at night,
02:06:08.92 --> 02:06:11.48 which is otherwise incredibly lonely.
02:06:11.48 --> 02:06:14.08 And then the first thing you notice is the bio-luminous
02:06:14.08 --> 02:06:16.24 gets harder and harder to see, which means, oh,
02:06:16.24 --> 02:06:18.48 the sun's going to be up in an hour.
02:06:18.48 --> 02:06:20.44 The sun comes up.
02:06:20.44 --> 02:06:22.04 Now the sun's like up there.
02:06:22.04 --> 02:06:25.36 I haven't heard anything, and I'm like, those guys,
02:06:25.36 --> 02:06:27.76 they forgot to tell me I've got 10 to go.
02:06:27.76 --> 02:06:28.96 That's OK.
02:06:28.96 --> 02:06:31.48 Probably down to 6 to go now.
02:06:31.48 --> 02:06:32.64 I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming.
02:06:32.64 --> 02:06:34.000 I'm just feeling like 10 o'clock in the morning.
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000 I mean, I'm being fissacious.
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.12 It's probably like 830 in the morning.
02:06:37.12 --> 02:06:39.68 And they're like, 10 to go.
02:06:39.68 --> 02:06:43.08 That was like, Jesus, who the hot.
02:06:43.08 --> 02:06:46.76 And because at that point, I had no clue what the current was like.
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:48.72 Because the swimmer can't feel current.
02:06:48.72 --> 02:06:50.52 Swimmers can only feel relative velocity,
02:06:50.52 --> 02:06:52.52 not absolute velocity.
02:06:52.52 --> 02:06:57.64 So that coupled with the torn labrum, coupled with,
02:06:57.64 --> 02:07:00.84 it ended up being over 14 hours of swimming.
02:07:00.84 --> 02:07:03.72 And this is a very long story because your question was so simple.
02:07:03.72 --> 02:07:05.92 But I remember getting on the boat.
02:07:05.92 --> 02:07:07.20 I don't even remember my question.
02:07:07.20 --> 02:07:08.88 Your question was about nutrition.
02:07:08.88 --> 02:07:11.56 We've actually about, about like, when I finally decided.
02:07:11.56 --> 02:07:15.000 I was over here in bio-loom and essence mail.
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.56 I mean, OK, so this is the day.
02:07:17.56 --> 02:07:18.96 So finish the swim.
02:07:18.96 --> 02:07:21.12 Get back to the boat.
02:07:21.12 --> 02:07:25.68 And they've got like two burgers and two coax waiting for me.
02:07:25.68 --> 02:07:28.08 And I mean, like I couldn't have eaten those things quicker.
02:07:28.08 --> 02:07:30.44 Like the biggest juiciest burgers you've ever seen.
02:07:30.44 --> 02:07:33.72 Like the coax, like they tasted so good, right?
02:07:33.72 --> 02:07:35.08 Because your mouth is so salty.
02:07:35.08 --> 02:07:37.32 Like you actually really want some sweet.
02:07:37.32 --> 02:07:40.56 And my wife, my wife hates when I tell this story
02:07:40.56 --> 02:07:45.04 because she denies that she said it, but she completely said it.
02:07:45.04 --> 02:07:46.64 She, I'm just sitting there.
02:07:46.64 --> 02:07:47.60 Like, I remember this.
02:07:47.60 --> 02:07:48.44 I haven't picked it up.
02:07:48.44 --> 02:07:49.76 Enjoy the burger fatty.
02:07:49.76 --> 02:07:50.92 All right.
02:07:50.92 --> 02:07:53.56 I've got like a USA towel wrapped around my waist
02:07:53.56 --> 02:07:56.28 and hailing like I'm two-fisting burgers
02:07:56.28 --> 02:07:57.44 drinking my coax.
02:07:57.44 --> 02:08:00.12 And she just looks at me and she goes, and again,
02:08:00.12 --> 02:08:02.64 just in the sweetest way possible.
02:08:02.64 --> 02:08:08.64 She said, you should probably work on being a little less not thin.
02:08:08.64 --> 02:08:09.64 Wow.
02:08:09.64 --> 02:08:10.64 Wow.
02:08:10.64 --> 02:08:13.32 It's less.
02:08:13.32 --> 02:08:16.92 Is that like the kindest way to just tell somebody
02:08:16.92 --> 02:08:18.44 you're kind of getting a little fat?
02:08:18.44 --> 02:08:19.44 Wow.
02:08:19.44 --> 02:08:20.76 Post 14 hours swim.
02:08:20.76 --> 02:08:23.08 You're hoping that it's get some.
02:08:23.08 --> 02:08:26.52 So that was the last time I had a coke.
02:08:26.52 --> 02:08:28.28 I've never had a coke since.
02:08:28.28 --> 02:08:29.84 Tame.
02:08:29.84 --> 02:08:31.88 And all I did, frankly, at the time, was just said,
02:08:31.88 --> 02:08:33.76 like I'm just going to try and experiment.
02:08:33.76 --> 02:08:35.28 Because I was like, look, at that time,
02:08:35.28 --> 02:08:37.40 I still thought it was just calories and calories out.
02:08:37.40 --> 02:08:38.88 I thought it was really just simple arithmetic.
02:08:38.88 --> 02:08:41.96 And my view was, all right, I can't do anything more
02:08:41.96 --> 02:08:43.88 on the calories outside.
02:08:43.88 --> 02:08:45.36 There's only 168 hours in a week.
02:08:45.36 --> 02:08:47.84 I'm not willing to exercise more than 28 of them.
02:08:47.84 --> 02:08:49.24 So calories out.
02:08:49.24 --> 02:08:51.04 I don't get to change that anymore.
02:08:51.04 --> 02:08:53.000 And frankly, I didn't really want to change the calories
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.44 inside because I hated being hungry.
02:08:54.44 --> 02:08:55.64 Every time I tried to eat less,
02:08:55.64 --> 02:08:58.12 I would just be so hungry I didn't know what to do with myself.
02:08:58.12 --> 02:08:59.92 So it was like, I'm going to try a new experiment.
02:08:59.92 --> 02:09:04.16 What if it's the type of calorie that might matter?
02:09:04.16 --> 02:09:07.44 Sugar strikes me as not great for you.
02:09:07.44 --> 02:09:10.48 Even though I can't tell you why,
02:09:10.48 --> 02:09:12.36 I'm going to stop having sugar.
02:09:12.36 --> 02:09:14.88 So that was my first experiment in September of 09.
02:09:14.88 --> 02:09:18.24 And that led to everything that's come since that time.
02:09:18.24 --> 02:09:20.48 Which obviously ultimately led to me coming back to medicine
02:09:20.48 --> 02:09:21.32 as well.
02:09:21.32 --> 02:09:22.000 Yeah.
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.08 And that's where you're at now.
02:09:24.08 --> 02:09:28.72 And by the way, listen to Tim Tim's podcast.
02:09:28.72 --> 02:09:31.84 What else did people listen to to get all that nutritional
02:09:31.84 --> 02:09:35.96 information the rest of the story?
02:09:35.96 --> 02:09:36.96 I think it's Tim's.
02:09:36.96 --> 02:09:37.48 Yeah.
02:09:37.48 --> 02:09:39.16 I mean, a couple of things with Tim.
02:09:39.16 --> 02:09:44.28 I did a podcast with Chris Krasser earlier this year.
02:09:44.28 --> 02:09:46.04 Talked about longevity a little bit.
02:09:46.04 --> 02:09:46.68 I did one.
02:09:46.68 --> 02:09:48.52 I probably have a, maybe, oh, you know what?
02:09:48.52 --> 02:09:49.72 Probably get more into nutrition.
02:09:49.72 --> 02:09:52.04 There's an IHMC video I did.
02:09:52.04 --> 02:09:53.84 Probably like three or four years ago.
02:09:53.84 --> 02:09:55.24 That one's like an hour long.
02:09:55.24 --> 02:09:56.72 And you go pretty detailed in it.
02:09:56.72 --> 02:09:57.24 Yep.
02:09:57.24 --> 02:09:57.60 OK.
02:09:57.60 --> 02:09:57.80 Yeah.
02:09:57.80 --> 02:09:59.64 I've watched that one.
02:09:59.64 --> 02:10:00.48 Yeah, those are good.
02:10:00.48 --> 02:10:03.04 Those are good.
02:10:03.04 --> 02:10:09.04 And again, if you had to kind of tell people that aren't going
02:10:09.04 --> 02:10:09.96 to go listen to those podcasts,
02:10:09.96 --> 02:10:14.32 and aren't going to watch that video, what would you tell them?
02:10:14.32 --> 02:10:19.32 You know, what would you tell them to eat overall?
02:10:19.32 --> 02:10:22.32 You know, I generally don't like talking about nutrition
02:10:22.32 --> 02:10:25.64 because, don't worry, I will answer this question.
02:10:25.64 --> 02:10:26.88 But I don't at least preface it.
02:10:26.88 --> 02:10:27.84 Why I don't like it.
02:10:27.84 --> 02:10:29.04 I don't like talking about this stuff.
02:10:32.04 --> 02:10:36.76 Nutrition is kind of a pseudo science that masquerades
02:10:36.76 --> 02:10:39.48 as a religion for many people.
02:10:39.48 --> 02:10:43.44 And so I find it difficult to have a discussion
02:10:43.44 --> 02:10:48.84 about biochemistry when it's so cloaked in emotion, religion,
02:10:48.84 --> 02:10:50.64 and dogma.
02:10:50.64 --> 02:10:52.80 No, that's not to say I don't have a strong point of view.
02:10:52.80 --> 02:10:53.92 I certainly do.
02:10:53.92 --> 02:10:55.40 It's also an evolving point of view.
02:10:55.40 --> 02:10:58.80 I feel different today than I felt four or five years ago.
02:10:58.80 --> 02:11:01.000 I feel different today than I felt two years ago.
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.80 And also, my life is one big experiment.
02:11:03.80 --> 02:11:06.20 So we were joking before I came in here.
02:11:06.20 --> 02:11:08.68 I've got a glucose meter buried within me at the moment.
02:11:08.68 --> 02:11:11.24 I've got all these heart rate variability things.
02:11:11.24 --> 02:11:16.000 Like everything I'm doing, actually, just check.
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.84 Actually, didn't experiment before I came here today.
02:11:17.84 --> 02:11:22.60 I ate something and I want to see how much it raised my blood sugar.
02:11:24.88 --> 02:11:26.16 That's not bad.
02:11:26.16 --> 02:11:27.40 What did you eat?
02:11:27.40 --> 02:11:31.44 So I ate this product that I've been doing some research on.
02:11:31.44 --> 02:11:36.44 It's called no KNOW like no foods.
02:11:36.44 --> 02:11:40.44 And I was introduced to this product by one of my patients
02:11:40.44 --> 02:11:42.48 who said, hey, Peter, I want you to kick the tires
02:11:42.48 --> 02:11:44.04 on this a little bit.
02:11:44.04 --> 02:11:49.44 It uses a sugar substitute called aliulose.
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:52.36 And it tastes amazing and apparently, like,
02:11:52.36 --> 02:11:54.28 it doesn't raise your blood sugar at all.
02:11:54.28 --> 02:11:57.64 And I was like, yeah, I'm familiar with aliulose
02:11:57.64 --> 02:11:59.44 for those who might not know.
02:11:59.44 --> 02:12:04.08 Aliulose is a sugar that occurs in nature
02:12:04.08 --> 02:12:09.08 in very small quantities that looks exactly like this sugar
02:12:09.08 --> 02:12:10.88 called fructose, which is fructose,
02:12:10.88 --> 02:12:14.60 the sweet component of sugar with one small exception.
02:12:14.60 --> 02:12:17.92 But that one small exception carries with it some very important things.
02:12:17.92 --> 02:12:20.24 One, it's not quite as sweet as fructose.
02:12:20.24 --> 02:12:22.32 It's about 70% of sweet.
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:24.08 But by giving up that little bit of that sweetness,
02:12:24.08 --> 02:12:25.40 you get a whole bunch of stuff in return.
02:12:25.40 --> 02:12:27.84 First of all, it's not metabolized by the liver,
02:12:27.84 --> 02:12:29.72 which is the real problem of fructose, too.
02:12:29.72 --> 02:12:31.28 You barely absorb it.
02:12:31.28 --> 02:12:35.72 So 99% of it or more or less is excreted by the kidneys.
02:12:35.72 --> 02:12:39.56 And three, it actually seems to lower blood glucose.
02:12:39.56 --> 02:12:44.56 So this company, no foods, is putting this,
02:12:44.56 --> 02:12:46.96 like, making stuff out of this,
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:50.36 but stuff that is like, carb-y, bread and waffles
02:12:50.36 --> 02:12:51.80 and muffins and stuff.
02:12:51.80 --> 02:12:54.32 So anyway, to make a long story short,
02:12:54.32 --> 02:12:55.36 I'm at this patient's house,
02:12:55.36 --> 02:12:56.64 and he's force feeding me these things,
02:12:56.64 --> 02:12:58.04 which is really my way of saying,
02:12:58.04 --> 02:13:00.80 he's left the bag open, and I'm inhaling them.
02:13:00.80 --> 02:13:02.80 And he's like, yeah, yeah, you've got to,
02:13:02.80 --> 02:13:04.64 you've got to tell me if this stuff's legit.
02:13:04.64 --> 02:13:05.84 So to make a long story short,
02:13:05.84 --> 02:13:08.60 he plugs me into the guy that flew down to the company.
02:13:08.60 --> 02:13:10.44 And he has sent me a bunch of this stuff
02:13:10.44 --> 02:13:13.40 to just play with, because he knows what I do.
02:13:13.40 --> 02:13:14.40 And so that's what I've been doing.
02:13:14.40 --> 02:13:17.40 So today, I normally don't eat breakfast.
02:13:17.40 --> 02:13:20.12 So I worked out this morning, and then before I came here,
02:13:20.12 --> 02:13:22.84 I had a big piece of their toast,
02:13:22.84 --> 02:13:24.40 covered in almond butter,
02:13:24.40 --> 02:13:26.68 and then two of their huge waffles
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:28.80 covered with almond butter and bananas.
02:13:28.80 --> 02:13:30.60 Like I made a big sandwich out of that.
02:13:30.60 --> 02:13:34.12 So the almond butter, not gonna have a huge glycemic response
02:13:34.12 --> 02:13:35.60 because it's got so much fat and protein.
02:13:35.60 --> 02:13:37.92 But the bananas should skyrocket my blood sugar.
02:13:37.92 --> 02:13:39.68 I can't imagine the two freaking waffles
02:13:39.68 --> 02:13:41.64 the size of my head and the piece of toast.
02:13:41.64 --> 02:13:45.40 So interestingly, so that was at nine o'clock
02:13:45.40 --> 02:13:47.08 that I ate those.
02:13:47.08 --> 02:13:50.56 Now I've been up since 330, but I didn't eat anything.
02:13:50.56 --> 02:13:53.08 I worked out from seven to eight.
02:13:53.08 --> 02:13:55.32 So admittedly, there's a bit of a glycogen debt.
02:13:55.32 --> 02:13:58.24 So at nine o'clock, when I ingested,
02:13:58.24 --> 02:14:02.92 my blood glucose was 65, and at its peak,
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.88 which was 11, 18 AM, it was up to 90.
02:14:07.88 --> 02:14:09.20 And it's now down to 83.
02:14:09.20 --> 02:14:11.20 What would real waffles have done to you?
02:14:11.20 --> 02:14:14.60 I think they would have sent me to like 140.
02:14:14.60 --> 02:14:19.000 Three huge pieces of bread slash waffle with the full banana.
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000 So anyway, I've been doing these experiments all week,
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.08 which is just a great excuse to eat this stuff.
02:14:24.08 --> 02:14:25.56 And I'm actually surprised.
02:14:25.56 --> 02:14:26.96 I'm kind of blown away.
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:28.80 So okay, with all that said,
02:14:28.80 --> 02:14:30.68 what's my advice for what people should eat?
02:14:33.36 --> 02:14:36.24 In an ideal world, everybody would have this thing embedded
02:14:36.24 --> 02:14:37.28 in them like I do.
02:14:37.28 --> 02:14:39.08 This thing is called a Dexcom G5.
02:14:39.08 --> 02:14:40.76 It's a continuous glucose monitor.
02:14:43.20 --> 02:14:45.92 Typically, only used by people with type one diabetes.
02:14:47.12 --> 02:14:49.08 We're now starting to see people with type two diabetes
02:14:49.08 --> 02:14:53.16 where of them, but I was really completely lucky
02:14:53.16 --> 02:14:55.92 one day sitting on an airplane next to a dude,
02:14:55.92 --> 02:14:57.60 who happened to be into watches.
02:14:57.60 --> 02:14:58.44 I'm into watches.
02:14:58.44 --> 02:14:59.60 We've got talking about watches.
02:14:59.60 --> 02:15:01.08 I find out he's the CEO of the company
02:15:01.08 --> 02:15:04.000 that makes this thing the rest of history, right?
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.80 I'm obsessed with this stuff.
02:15:05.80 --> 02:15:10.04 And so because the answer is this, right?
02:15:10.04 --> 02:15:11.92 If you were a computer program, I would say,
02:15:11.92 --> 02:15:15.44 Jaco, eat whatever you want to eat,
02:15:15.44 --> 02:15:19.72 such that your average blood glucose remains below 85
02:15:19.72 --> 02:15:22.68 milligrams per desoliter and your standard deviation,
02:15:22.68 --> 02:15:25.24 below 10 milligrams per desoliter.
02:15:25.24 --> 02:15:26.96 So translate that into English.
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:27.64 Okay.
02:15:27.64 --> 02:15:31.36 So eat in whatever way your genetics and epigenetics
02:15:31.36 --> 02:15:34.40 permit you to, such that your glucose levels
02:15:34.40 --> 02:15:37.84 stay low and the variability stays low.
02:15:37.84 --> 02:15:40.000 And those two things will ensure
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.92 that your insulin level stay low.
02:15:41.92 --> 02:15:44.36 So what I'm trying to do is optimize for something called
02:15:44.36 --> 02:15:47.52 the insulin AUC or area under the curve.
02:15:47.52 --> 02:15:49.88 Now we can't measure that test clinically.
02:15:49.88 --> 02:15:52.04 Now let me make it measure that as put you in a hospital,
02:15:52.04 --> 02:15:53.76 put a central line in your neck
02:15:53.76 --> 02:15:56.96 and excuse me, sample your blood every 30 minutes
02:15:56.96 --> 02:16:00.28 over the course of a day where you somehow act normally.
02:16:00.28 --> 02:16:01.12 And every day.
02:16:01.12 --> 02:16:03.36 So then I'd have a time axis, y-axis,
02:16:03.36 --> 02:16:06.04 sorry, the x-axis would be time, the y-axis would be
02:16:06.04 --> 02:16:07.80 insulin level and we'd generate a curve
02:16:07.80 --> 02:16:10.40 and we'd calculate the area under that curve
02:16:10.40 --> 02:16:12.76 and we want that number to be as low as possible.
02:16:12.76 --> 02:16:15.16 So we can't do that outside of the research setting.
02:16:15.16 --> 02:16:18.56 So then the next best thing is keep your average glucose
02:16:18.56 --> 02:16:20.88 as low as possible and the variability.
02:16:20.88 --> 02:16:23.96 So you could have an average glucose of 100
02:16:23.96 --> 02:16:26.92 with low variability and that actually wouldn't produce
02:16:26.92 --> 02:16:30.92 that much insulin or you could have a glucose of 100
02:16:30.92 --> 02:16:34.04 with high variability, same average glucose,
02:16:34.04 --> 02:16:36.16 higher variability is gonna have higher insulin
02:16:36.16 --> 02:16:37.48 all things equal.
02:16:37.48 --> 02:16:40.88 So just through empirical testing in myself
02:16:40.88 --> 02:16:43.04 over the past year and a half,
02:16:43.04 --> 02:16:45.80 I've realized that an average blood glucose
02:16:45.80 --> 02:16:49.40 and this thing tells me every time I hit click,
02:16:49.40 --> 02:16:51.68 like it gives me my last 14 days,
02:16:52.68 --> 02:16:55.28 I just realized like for my average to be below 85
02:16:55.28 --> 02:16:59.28 and my standard deviation to be below 10 is like super dialed in.
02:16:59.28 --> 02:17:04.28 So what you can eat to achieve that varies tremendously
02:17:05.04 --> 02:17:06.76 by individual.
02:17:06.76 --> 02:17:08.16 You know, there are some people who just dispose
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:09.16 of glucose from our company.
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:11.52 So that blood test we're gonna do in you next week
02:17:11.52 --> 02:17:15.16 is going to be our best test at measuring that.
02:17:16.68 --> 02:17:20.36 And so glucose disposal is mostly a function
02:17:20.36 --> 02:17:22.92 of the insulin sensitivity of the muscle
02:17:22.92 --> 02:17:25.20 because the muscle is where we dispose
02:17:25.20 --> 02:17:26.96 of the majority of glucose.
02:17:26.96 --> 02:17:30.44 But it's more a little more complicated than that, right?
02:17:30.44 --> 02:17:32.64 Sleep impacts that.
02:17:32.64 --> 02:17:37.64 So sleep deprivation makes us more insulin resistant.
02:17:37.64 --> 02:17:39.96 So this has been experimentally demonstrated
02:17:39.96 --> 02:17:42.60 even with two weeks of sleep deprivation.
02:17:42.60 --> 02:17:45.96 So there's a, it's a small but very well controlled experiment
02:17:45.96 --> 02:17:48.32 that was done out of University of Chicago
02:17:48.32 --> 02:17:49.80 price six years ago.
02:17:49.80 --> 02:17:51.92 They took a very small number of subjects,
02:17:51.92 --> 02:17:53.36 like I said, about eight subjects
02:17:53.36 --> 02:17:57.76 and for two weeks let them only sleep four hours a night
02:17:57.76 --> 02:18:01.64 and they did a very invasive test called a Uglysi
02:18:01.64 --> 02:18:03.84 McKinsey-Lun Clamp at the beginning and at the end
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:07.84 of the experiment and their insulin sensitivity,
02:18:07.84 --> 02:18:10.72 their glucose disposal deteriorated by 50%.
02:18:10.72 --> 02:18:13.20 And with no change in what they were eating.
02:18:13.20 --> 02:18:14.20 Yeah.
02:18:14.20 --> 02:18:18.12 So it's highly variable, right?
02:18:18.12 --> 02:18:20.56 So that's theoretically the answer.
02:18:20.56 --> 02:18:25.36 On a practical level, I would say the answer is this, right?
02:18:25.36 --> 02:18:29.84 If it comes in a package, you're probably better off not eating it,
02:18:29.84 --> 02:18:31.24 right?
02:18:31.24 --> 02:18:36.72 If your ancestors couldn't have eaten this even 200 years ago,
02:18:36.72 --> 02:18:39.64 it's probably not worth eating.
02:18:39.64 --> 02:18:42.64 So if you just followed that advice,
02:18:42.64 --> 02:18:46.12 think about how many things you'd eliminate from your diet,
02:18:46.12 --> 02:18:46.80 right?
02:18:46.80 --> 02:18:49.92 If you just took packaged foods away from your diet,
02:18:49.92 --> 02:18:51.80 and again, notice I'm agnostic.
02:18:51.80 --> 02:18:53.48 You want to be a vegan, not yourself out.
02:18:53.48 --> 02:18:55.40 You want to be the paleo man of the century?
02:18:55.40 --> 02:18:56.24 Go for it.
02:18:56.24 --> 02:18:57.32 I don't get a shunt.
02:18:57.32 --> 02:18:58.16 Okay.
02:18:58.16 --> 02:19:00.44 I couldn't care less, right?
02:19:00.44 --> 02:19:03.08 But if you can largely adhere to those principles,
02:19:03.08 --> 02:19:05.20 you're kind of going to be fine.
02:19:05.20 --> 02:19:08.16 Do you want, you know, you're going to get 70% of the way there.
02:19:08.16 --> 02:19:10.12 You want to get 80, 90, 100% of the way there?
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:11.92 Yeah, well then there is no simple answer.
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:13.48 Now at that point, you got a dial in
02:19:13.48 --> 02:19:16.04 and you got to go full immersion into
02:19:16.04 --> 02:19:18.52 how do you tweak to your biochemistry?
02:19:18.52 --> 02:19:20.96 How much protein, what's the timing of the meals?
02:19:20.96 --> 02:19:21.96 When do we fast?
02:19:21.96 --> 02:19:25.64 I mean, all of the stuff that is my world
02:19:25.64 --> 02:19:28.32 and maybe soon to be your world,
02:19:28.32 --> 02:19:33.32 that's the stuff for which you cannot provide,
02:19:33.32 --> 02:19:34.80 you know, systemic advice.
02:19:34.80 --> 02:19:38.92 But at the societal level or at the just the most basic level,
02:19:38.92 --> 02:19:40.000 yeah, I mean, think about that advice.
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.88 Like you don't eat sugar anymore.
02:19:41.88 --> 02:19:44.12 You won't eat refined carbohydrates anymore.
02:19:44.12 --> 02:19:47.08 You're not going to eat processed crappy foods anymore.
02:19:47.08 --> 02:19:48.08 What are you going to eat?
02:19:48.08 --> 02:19:48.92 You're going to eat fruits.
02:19:48.92 --> 02:19:49.76 You're going to eat vegetables.
02:19:49.76 --> 02:19:50.76 You're going to eat meat.
02:19:50.76 --> 02:19:52.12 You're going to eat grain.
02:19:52.12 --> 02:19:53.40 What kind of grains are you going to eat?
02:19:53.40 --> 02:19:57.44 Well, you're not going to really eat these refined crappy grains
02:19:57.44 --> 02:19:58.44 that people eat.
02:19:58.44 --> 02:20:00.40 You're going to, you know, your starches, I'm sorry, not grains.
02:20:00.40 --> 02:20:02.16 Your starches are probably going to be in the form of potatoes
02:20:02.16 --> 02:20:03.36 and rice.
02:20:03.36 --> 02:20:07.80 So again, I just, I sort of, I think the reason I like talking
02:20:07.80 --> 02:20:10.24 about nutrition anymore is I don't find it to be
02:20:10.24 --> 02:20:12.68 intellectually honest, discussion anymore.
02:20:12.68 --> 02:20:14.76 I find it to be just a discussion of dogma, right?
02:20:14.76 --> 02:20:16.96 So if you're a low carb camp, you're a low carb camp.
02:20:16.96 --> 02:20:20.92 If you're in the, you know, whatever the vegan camp, you're in the vegan camp.
02:20:20.92 --> 02:20:24.60 Like there's that you can't even have a discussion about this stuff.
02:20:24.60 --> 02:20:27.32 And at least not with most people.
02:20:27.32 --> 02:20:28.32 Yeah.
02:20:28.32 --> 02:20:31.64 So I, you know, you ever read the book called Diet Cults?
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:32.64 I know.
02:20:32.64 --> 02:20:33.64 So it's getting to the non-sense.
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:35.64 What you said right there?
02:20:35.64 --> 02:20:36.64 That's the whole book.
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:38.04 Really so interesting.
02:20:38.04 --> 02:20:39.04 Fondery too.
02:20:39.04 --> 02:20:40.04 So good.
02:20:40.04 --> 02:20:42.04 I will have to check that out.
02:20:42.04 --> 02:20:43.04 Diet Cults.
02:20:43.04 --> 02:20:46.80 Now I kind of open with this and since we're, since we're
02:20:46.80 --> 02:20:54.32 a little over two hours right now, I said that you're probably the most
02:20:54.32 --> 02:20:58.92 responsible individual for this podcast.
02:20:58.92 --> 02:21:06.60 And because you originally through Kirk set me up to do a podcast with
02:21:06.60 --> 02:21:10.44 Tim Ferriss, which sent me up to do a podcast with Joe Rogan, which was just
02:21:10.44 --> 02:21:11.68 all awesome.
02:21:11.68 --> 02:21:13.88 And both of those guys told me I should do my own podcast.
02:21:13.88 --> 02:21:16.68 So anyone that's listening to this podcast, say
02:21:16.68 --> 02:21:18.32 thanks to Peter for that.
02:21:18.32 --> 02:21:19.32 Thanks.
02:21:19.32 --> 02:21:20.64 Actually, they should thank Kirk, right?
02:21:20.64 --> 02:21:21.64 Yeah, Kirk.
02:21:21.64 --> 02:21:22.64 Kirk was the man.
02:21:22.64 --> 02:21:25.96 You know, I mean, Kirk is, I don't need to tell you, but Kirk's one of those
02:21:25.96 --> 02:21:30.12 guys where like he doesn't have to justify an ask, right?
02:21:30.12 --> 02:21:33.36 So when he introduced me to you, he didn't have to explain.
02:21:33.36 --> 02:21:36.24 He was just like, I want you to meet Jocco, Jocco as my friend.
02:21:36.24 --> 02:21:37.64 It was like, that's good enough.
02:21:37.64 --> 02:21:41.76 And so to me, like, that's the measure of when life is good.
02:21:41.76 --> 02:21:44.76 And because I feel that way with all of my friends, like if Tim introduces me to
02:21:44.76 --> 02:21:47.72 somebody, like Tim's introduced me to like a dozen people, it doesn't
02:21:47.72 --> 02:21:50.04 amazing relationships have come out of that, right?
02:21:50.04 --> 02:21:55.64 And so, you know, really it was just very easy for me to sort of take Kirk
02:21:55.64 --> 02:21:59.08 on his word that like, if Jocco's great guy, then that's all I need to know.
02:21:59.08 --> 02:22:00.48 I knew you're going to be a great guy.
02:22:00.48 --> 02:22:04.36 And then similarly, like I could tell Tim, like, hey, you got to meet Jocco.
02:22:04.36 --> 02:22:07.28 And you know, Tim gets quote unquote pitched all day long.
02:22:07.28 --> 02:22:08.28 Yeah, it does.
02:22:08.28 --> 02:22:12.48 But, you know, he knows that I'm not going to send him somebody that's not
02:22:12.48 --> 02:22:16.76 you know, going to be really interesting and going to benefit his listeners, not
02:22:16.76 --> 02:22:19.48 just, you know, whatever agenda that person might have.
02:22:19.48 --> 02:22:20.48 Yeah.
02:22:20.48 --> 02:22:21.48 Yeah.
02:22:21.48 --> 02:22:22.48 No, it was awesome.
02:22:22.48 --> 02:22:28.20 And that really did him in the way, Tim, the way Tim advised the way he was going
02:22:28.20 --> 02:22:30.48 to release the podcast to know and support the public.
02:22:30.48 --> 02:22:31.92 I mean, he just nailed it.
02:22:31.92 --> 02:22:36.000 It was kind of ridiculous the way he understands that stuff.
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.28 And how helpful it was to, you know, get in our book out there and get in its
02:22:40.28 --> 02:22:44.76 old and all that and get in all these people on board and then, you know, that turned
02:22:44.76 --> 02:22:49.96 into this podcast, which, you know, he definitely has promoted the podcast and a fantastic
02:22:49.96 --> 02:22:51.20 way along with Joe.
02:22:51.20 --> 02:22:52.20 So that's both been awesome.
02:22:52.20 --> 02:22:56.64 But again, start with Kirk, connect to me with you and then you connect to me with
02:22:56.64 --> 02:22:57.64 Tim.
02:22:57.64 --> 02:22:59.84 So I appreciate that.
02:22:59.84 --> 02:23:09.68 And speaking of this podcast, my almost silent partner over here at Coach Charles, if
02:23:09.68 --> 02:23:14.76 somebody wants to support the podcast, how would you recommend they go ahead and do that?
02:23:14.76 --> 02:23:17.76 You always have a question.
02:23:17.76 --> 02:23:21.76 Oh, how'd you hurt your back originally?
02:23:21.76 --> 02:23:25.32 You know, I don't think we ever really have a diagnosis.
02:23:25.32 --> 02:23:31.16 There was certainly nothing on that day that I did that day I've ride my bike to the gym.
02:23:31.16 --> 02:23:35.44 I, you know, I think about the sins of my youth.
02:23:35.44 --> 02:23:41.92 You know, I was really into martial arts in addition to boxing and I used to spend a ton
02:23:41.92 --> 02:23:42.92 of time.
02:23:42.92 --> 02:23:45.52 I was really obsessed with spinning back kicks.
02:23:45.52 --> 02:23:48.76 Now, I don't know if that could have done it or not.
02:23:48.76 --> 02:23:53.92 But I used to practice 75 spinning back kicks with each leg every single day for probably
02:23:53.92 --> 02:23:57.24 about six years, seven years.
02:23:57.24 --> 02:24:00.44 It's possible, even though in theory, it's spinning back kick if done correctly, it should
02:24:00.44 --> 02:24:02.84 really not put any torque on the lower back.
02:24:02.84 --> 02:24:06.96 It's much more in your hips and technically the flexibilities and the thoracic spine, not
02:24:06.96 --> 02:24:07.96 the lumbar spine.
02:24:07.96 --> 02:24:12.08 But, you know, God knows, maybe I just wasn't doing those things correctly.
02:24:12.08 --> 02:24:14.12 I did squat and deadlift really heavy growing up.
02:24:14.12 --> 02:24:16.72 I did powerlifting and sort of a side sport.
02:24:16.72 --> 02:24:21.44 But, you know, certainly never hurt myself doing that.
02:24:21.44 --> 02:24:23.36 I rode crew for a year.
02:24:23.36 --> 02:24:28.04 And so I always, I'm always wondering if that was the most destructive thing I did because
02:24:28.04 --> 02:24:30.60 in an eight man boat, it's eight year asymmetric.
02:24:30.60 --> 02:24:31.60 Right?
02:24:31.60 --> 02:24:34.12 All your symmetric when you sweep you're not.
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:36.72 And so I was like, I was a sweeper.
02:24:36.72 --> 02:24:40.16 And so I'm always wonder if that's the most destructive thing I ever did.
02:24:40.16 --> 02:24:41.16 Yeah.
02:24:41.16 --> 02:24:45.76 And then you figure if you're asymmetrical like that, your everyday life is asymmetric.
02:24:45.76 --> 02:24:46.76 Really?
02:24:46.76 --> 02:24:48.76 Because you have a little bit of overdevelopment on the side.
02:24:48.76 --> 02:24:49.76 I don't know, I might have been there.
02:24:49.76 --> 02:24:51.24 So I guess I've never really known.
02:24:51.24 --> 02:24:52.44 But I take it really seriously.
02:24:52.44 --> 02:24:56.32 Today, in fact, you know, Jack, you'll dig this.
02:24:56.32 --> 02:25:02.80 Two weeks ago, I did a video in New York with a friend of mine named Jesse Schwarzman.
02:25:02.80 --> 02:25:05.44 And he's like, I call him the Savant of Movement.
02:25:05.44 --> 02:25:08.88 This guy's like, just like the kinesthetic man.
02:25:08.88 --> 02:25:14.96 And I wanted to put a video together of how do you train to train?
02:25:14.96 --> 02:25:16.48 How do you prepare your body to train?
02:25:16.48 --> 02:25:18.08 So it's basically three sections.
02:25:18.08 --> 02:25:22.52 It's what's the sort of dynamic?
02:25:22.52 --> 02:25:26.28 Well, the sort of tissue preparation, the static prep and the dynamic prep.
02:25:26.28 --> 02:25:31.12 It took us eight, not even six hours to shoot this video.
02:25:31.12 --> 02:25:35.16 It'll be edited down into probably three, ten minute videos.
02:25:35.16 --> 02:25:37.96 And as soon as they're done editing, I'm just going to throw them up on YouTube and my blog.
02:25:37.96 --> 02:25:39.84 So I'll make sure you've got a copy.
02:25:39.84 --> 02:25:40.84 Awesome.
02:25:40.84 --> 02:25:45.24 It's, I mean, Jesse's just, you know, he walks me through all the exercises.
02:25:45.24 --> 02:25:49.08 But I get the sense like if I had done that stuff all the way in my life, I probably never
02:25:49.08 --> 02:25:50.08 would've been hurt.
02:25:50.08 --> 02:25:51.08 And luckily, knock on wood to this day.
02:25:51.08 --> 02:25:55.32 I mean, I never thought I'd be able to squat and deadlift again after going through
02:25:55.32 --> 02:25:56.56 that year of my life.
02:25:56.56 --> 02:25:59.36 But amazingly, I'm totally fine.
02:25:59.36 --> 02:26:01.96 And it was a herniated disc that pops off the...
02:26:01.96 --> 02:26:06.000 Yeah, so it was an L5S1 really big herniation.
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.80 But then a four or five centimeter fragment broke off and then floats down the canal.
02:26:10.80 --> 02:26:12.36 And that was sitting on the nerve root.
02:26:12.36 --> 02:26:14.60 And then I developed a few other problems after.
02:26:14.60 --> 02:26:19.32 So I developed this thing called a fissette arthropathy, which resulted in the feeling
02:26:19.32 --> 02:26:22.52 of having my testicles torn out from the inside.
02:26:22.52 --> 02:26:23.52 I'm not even joking.
02:26:23.52 --> 02:26:25.80 It's just so, it's just unbearable.
02:26:25.80 --> 02:26:27.56 Yeah, I would imagine that's unbearable.
02:26:27.56 --> 02:26:28.56 I don't recommend that.
02:26:28.56 --> 02:26:29.56 No.
02:26:29.56 --> 02:26:31.56 All right.
02:26:31.56 --> 02:26:36.80 Well, that being said, yes, we can talk about it.
02:26:36.80 --> 02:26:39.72 So we can talk about on it.
02:26:39.72 --> 02:26:43.92 I was talking with Greg and Terry.
02:26:43.92 --> 02:26:46.84 And I was showing them the warrior bars.
02:26:46.84 --> 02:26:47.84 Right.
02:26:47.84 --> 02:26:48.84 These are dope.
02:26:48.84 --> 02:26:51.28 And then he was like, oh yeah, like what else is there?
02:26:51.28 --> 02:26:52.44 There's some good stuff on it.
02:26:52.44 --> 02:26:53.44 This is good stuff.
02:26:53.44 --> 02:26:57.60 So I brought out that that new pre workout on, which is good by the way, every part of
02:26:57.60 --> 02:26:58.60 that.
02:26:58.60 --> 02:27:02.60 So that one comes out and then the krill oil comes out, oh yeah, this is good for this.
02:27:02.60 --> 02:27:05.000 So we're talking about this big table of like all the stuff.
02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.44 It's not a lot of like four things that worry bar, krill oil and the pre workout.
02:27:10.44 --> 02:27:12.44 And three things.
02:27:12.44 --> 02:27:14.68 And work like yeah, this does this and this does this.
02:27:14.68 --> 02:27:19.44 And then I kind of step back and I'm like yeah, we're those guys with all our supplements
02:27:19.44 --> 02:27:21.72 talking about supplements, talking about supplements, right?
02:27:21.72 --> 02:27:22.72 Which I've never done.
02:27:22.72 --> 02:27:28.32 And Greg goes, yeah, if we weren't such nice guys, this would be a real douchey conversation.
02:27:28.32 --> 02:27:36.60 So the kind of the irony there is him saying that he's the one having the douchey conversation,
02:27:36.60 --> 02:27:40.000 but he is the nice guy.
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000 You get it?
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000 I guess so.
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000 Anyway.
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.72 Point there or actually the second point there is on it is good supplement.
02:27:46.72 --> 02:27:51.52 So if you do talk about them while you're taking them, you're not having a douchey conversation.
02:27:51.52 --> 02:27:56.32 I heard Joe Rogan talking the other day about how hard it is when you're a stand up comedian
02:27:56.32 --> 02:27:58.36 and you tell a joke and it just flat.
02:27:58.36 --> 02:27:59.36 Yeah, I just got it.
02:27:59.36 --> 02:28:01.64 Yeah, but that one here's the thing.
02:28:01.64 --> 02:28:02.64 That's the thing.
02:28:02.64 --> 02:28:03.64 There were, there were.
02:28:03.64 --> 02:28:04.80 I was going to go mercy last.
02:28:04.80 --> 02:28:05.80 But I didn't do it.
02:28:05.80 --> 02:28:06.96 There's a lot of merciful brosod.
02:28:06.96 --> 02:28:10.88 That one, that had joking elements, but this is true in this part of a bigger point that
02:28:10.88 --> 02:28:11.88 I'm making.
02:28:11.88 --> 02:28:12.88 I hope so.
02:28:12.88 --> 02:28:15.52 I don't expect you to laugh at everything I say.
02:28:15.52 --> 02:28:18.84 Even though you create a much too.
02:28:18.84 --> 02:28:20.08 Anyway.
02:28:20.08 --> 02:28:25.88 The reason that it's not a douchey conversation here's the point is because on its supplements,
02:28:25.88 --> 02:28:29.32 the krill oil, all that stuff is actually good quality.
02:28:29.32 --> 02:28:30.60 It's not like, hey, I'm a meathead.
02:28:30.60 --> 02:28:32.32 I'm going to get buffing all this stuff.
02:28:32.32 --> 02:28:34.20 It actually helps your performance.
02:28:34.20 --> 02:28:40.24 Anyway, so in the event of you wanting on it stuff and supporting this podcast, while
02:28:40.24 --> 02:28:43.32 at the same time supporting yourself, go to on it.com slash.
02:28:43.32 --> 02:28:50.24 So 10% off, boom, second way to support Amazon click through.
02:28:50.24 --> 02:28:55.84 Christmas is over, but we still need stuff duct tape, whatever.
02:28:55.84 --> 02:28:58.12 Nice, et cetera.
02:28:58.12 --> 02:29:02.12 If you want to support this podcast, just go to the website, chocopodcast.com, click through
02:29:02.12 --> 02:29:07.96 the Amazon banner link before you do your shopping.
02:29:07.96 --> 02:29:10.000 You can support that way.
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.12 It's a good way to support.
02:29:14.12 --> 02:29:16.32 Yeah, you're in to chemistry, right?
02:29:16.32 --> 02:29:21.04 Sodium, when you put a little piece of sodium in the water, it makes this big commotion.
02:29:21.04 --> 02:29:23.64 So that's what the Amazon click through does.
02:29:23.64 --> 02:29:29.24 It seems like this small little thing, but applied properly, it makes a big impact in
02:29:29.24 --> 02:29:30.24 the podcast.
02:29:30.24 --> 02:29:31.24 Support ways.
02:29:31.24 --> 02:29:32.24 Anyway, thought you'd get...
02:29:32.24 --> 02:29:34.64 Can we verify that, doctor?
02:29:34.64 --> 02:29:39.64 I will have to go and look at the Amazon click through.
02:29:39.64 --> 02:29:43.12 I tell Jocca that he typically doesn't really understand because he doesn't know what sodium
02:29:43.12 --> 02:29:44.12 does.
02:29:44.12 --> 02:29:46.92 It might be in potassium or both actually.
02:29:46.92 --> 02:29:49.60 So now this whole thing has been a lie.
02:29:49.60 --> 02:29:50.60 No, I'm not sure.
02:29:50.60 --> 02:29:52.60 Not an on pretty sure.
02:29:52.60 --> 02:29:54.24 I'm actually fairly sure.
02:29:54.24 --> 02:29:57.16 Pretty sure goes a long way back or I guess.
02:29:57.16 --> 02:29:58.16 Yeah.
02:29:58.16 --> 02:30:05.20 Anyway, you can subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, which seems obvious because typically
02:30:05.20 --> 02:30:07.20 the podcast you listen to, you subscribe to.
02:30:07.20 --> 02:30:13.20 But sometimes you don't subscribe if you have not already and you want to support the
02:30:13.20 --> 02:30:14.20 podcast.
02:30:14.20 --> 02:30:16.88 Google Play, Stitcher, also in the game.
02:30:16.88 --> 02:30:17.88 Yeah.
02:30:17.88 --> 02:30:18.88 And iTunes.
02:30:18.88 --> 02:30:21.96 Yeah, it's kind of unfair that I don't think about that as much.
02:30:21.96 --> 02:30:24.60 You don't want to have an iPhone, like you kind of forget all this other stuff.
02:30:24.60 --> 02:30:25.60 I'm here to help out.
02:30:25.60 --> 02:30:26.60 Yeah, man.
02:30:26.60 --> 02:30:30.88 Good thing you're here on this podcast.
02:30:30.88 --> 02:30:32.68 YouTube, of course.
02:30:32.68 --> 02:30:34.84 We're working on putting more videos on there.
02:30:34.84 --> 02:30:37.84 Aside from the whole podcast.
02:30:37.84 --> 02:30:43.84 So some of those videos and I have gotten like messages saying like those shorter clips
02:30:43.84 --> 02:30:44.84 are helpful.
02:30:44.84 --> 02:30:45.84 They are helpful.
02:30:45.84 --> 02:30:47.84 Rather than listening to the whole podcast.
02:30:47.84 --> 02:30:52.52 And there's been people that have been submitting to you on Twitter, which excerpts
02:30:52.52 --> 02:30:55.84 are in high demand out there in the world.
02:30:55.84 --> 02:30:56.84 Yeah.
02:30:56.84 --> 02:30:57.84 Yeah, I've been following now.
02:30:57.84 --> 02:31:01.28 In fact, to have them all like it's a process.
02:31:01.28 --> 02:31:02.68 But yeah, we're working on that.
02:31:02.68 --> 02:31:03.92 So subscribe to YouTube.
02:31:03.92 --> 02:31:04.92 We are working on that.
02:31:04.92 --> 02:31:05.92 We are.
02:31:05.92 --> 02:31:06.92 We are.
02:31:06.92 --> 02:31:07.92 Collective.
02:31:07.92 --> 02:31:09.92 Just say you guys know I'm not working on it.
02:31:09.92 --> 02:31:11.92 But echo of Barrett Vs, which is cool.
02:31:11.92 --> 02:31:14.92 Well, technically you say, hey, but put this one out.
02:31:14.92 --> 02:31:15.92 Okay.
02:31:15.92 --> 02:31:16.92 I'm hard to tell you.
02:31:16.92 --> 02:31:17.92 Yeah, man, exactly.
02:31:17.92 --> 02:31:22.72 And then in the event of you wearing like what, like a t-shirt or something or hoodie,
02:31:22.72 --> 02:31:24.20 Jockel has a store.
02:31:24.20 --> 02:31:26.92 It's called Jockel Store.
02:31:26.92 --> 02:31:27.92 The URL is Jockel Store.
02:31:27.92 --> 02:31:28.92 Yeah, exactly.
02:31:28.92 --> 02:31:30.92 Is that a calculator watch you there?
02:31:30.92 --> 02:31:32.92 I was going to get to that.
02:31:32.92 --> 02:31:36.92 You mentioned, see now we've got to change subject real quick, which I like, by the way.
02:31:36.92 --> 02:31:38.92 Remember you're talking about your inter watches.
02:31:38.92 --> 02:31:39.92 Yeah.
02:31:39.92 --> 02:31:42.92 I was going to show I didn't want to interrupt what you're saying.
02:31:42.92 --> 02:31:44.92 That is your appreciate.
02:31:44.92 --> 02:31:47.92 That is ridiculous.
02:31:47.92 --> 02:31:50.92 I just ring incorporated this one back.
02:31:50.92 --> 02:31:52.92 What is it, a calculator watch?
02:31:52.92 --> 02:31:53.92 Yeah.
02:31:53.92 --> 02:31:56.92 Actually, one of the first pictures I posted on Twitter was up before the enemy.
02:31:56.92 --> 02:31:59.92 And it was like, you know, Jockel is always like, yeah, 430.
02:31:59.92 --> 02:32:00.92 Which one is at the Casio?
02:32:00.92 --> 02:32:01.92 Yeah, Casio.
02:32:01.92 --> 02:32:02.92 Oh, cool.
02:32:02.92 --> 02:32:07.92 2, 3, 4, 4, 5.
02:32:07.92 --> 02:32:09.92 That watch when I was a kid.
02:32:09.92 --> 02:32:11.92 Like, I would have flizzled some for that.
02:32:11.92 --> 02:32:13.92 Only the cookies had the calculator one.
02:32:13.92 --> 02:32:16.92 Oh, usually if you had a watch, it was just the regular Casio.
02:32:16.92 --> 02:32:18.92 And the cookies had the Calkey.
02:32:18.92 --> 02:32:21.92 I had the first Iron Man.
02:32:21.92 --> 02:32:22.92 Did you?
02:32:22.92 --> 02:32:23.92 Yeah.
02:32:23.92 --> 02:32:25.92 It was black with like a little red trim on it.
02:32:25.92 --> 02:32:27.92 I asked for it for Christmas.
02:32:27.92 --> 02:32:30.92 My parents got it for me, but I knew where they hid presents.
02:32:30.92 --> 02:32:35.92 So every day after school I would go into their room and I would take it out of the box.
02:32:35.92 --> 02:32:37.92 And I would set the time.
02:32:37.92 --> 02:32:38.92 I would wear it.
02:32:38.92 --> 02:32:40.92 I would just hang out there.
02:32:40.92 --> 02:32:43.92 And then before I go to bed, I'd like sneak back, put it in.
02:32:43.92 --> 02:32:46.92 And so like on Christmas Day, it was like I'd been wearing the watch for a month.
02:32:46.92 --> 02:32:48.92 Those are your watch.
02:32:48.92 --> 02:32:50.92 Actually, I think you got it.
02:32:50.92 --> 02:32:51.92 I'm in the watch as soon.
02:32:51.92 --> 02:32:52.92 Yeah.
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:52.92 Yeah.
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:54.92 Well, I got one.
02:32:54.92 --> 02:32:56.92 Actually, I got quite a few of these.
02:32:56.92 --> 02:32:58.92 I guess you should have your own brand of watch.
02:32:58.92 --> 02:32:59.92 Yeah.
02:32:59.92 --> 02:33:00.92 We'll see how all that turns out.
02:33:00.92 --> 02:33:01.92 Yeah.
02:33:01.92 --> 02:33:02.92 Yeah.
02:33:02.92 --> 02:33:03.92 I'm not going to listen.
02:33:03.92 --> 02:33:04.92 Yeah.
02:33:04.92 --> 02:33:07.92 I am very proud of this Calkey layer watch.
02:33:07.92 --> 02:33:08.92 Back to the store though.
02:33:08.92 --> 02:33:09.92 Jockel store.
02:33:09.92 --> 02:33:10.92 No watches.
02:33:10.92 --> 02:33:11.92 Yeah.
02:33:11.92 --> 02:33:12.92 Yeah.
02:33:12.92 --> 02:33:13.92 Yeah.
02:33:13.92 --> 02:33:14.92 But there are some cool shirts.
02:33:14.92 --> 02:33:16.92 In my opinion, I think they're cool.
02:33:16.92 --> 02:33:18.92 Displinicals freedom of all these things.
02:33:18.92 --> 02:33:20.92 Jockels had good, written in backwards.
02:33:20.92 --> 02:33:23.92 Various layers to these shirts.
02:33:23.92 --> 02:33:27.92 Not just like, oh, picture that's it.
02:33:27.92 --> 02:33:32.92 So if you like any of that stuff, I'm not even saying go buy this stuff.
02:33:32.92 --> 02:33:33.92 I'm not saying that.
02:33:33.92 --> 02:33:35.92 Just go to the Jockel store.com.
02:33:35.92 --> 02:33:38.92 See, if you like it, if you like it, you won't want to buy one.
02:33:38.92 --> 02:33:41.92 And that's a person podcast.
02:33:41.92 --> 02:33:44.92 You know, it's a systemic thing.
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:45.92 Good.
02:33:45.92 --> 02:33:46.92 There you go.
02:33:46.92 --> 02:33:47.92 Patches on there as well.
02:33:47.92 --> 02:33:48.92 Rashcards.
02:33:48.92 --> 02:33:50.92 Oh, you know what you didn't mention?
02:33:50.92 --> 02:33:54.92 That you should have mentioned, because apparently it's been pretty cool out there in the world.
02:33:54.92 --> 02:33:55.92 Lain on me.
02:33:55.92 --> 02:33:56.92 Psychological warfare.
02:33:56.92 --> 02:33:57.92 Yeah.
02:33:57.92 --> 02:34:01.92 I didn't mention it this time, but I mentioned it last time.
02:34:01.92 --> 02:34:03.92 And in my everyday life.
02:34:03.92 --> 02:34:04.92 And I use it.
02:34:04.92 --> 02:34:05.92 So there you go.
02:34:05.92 --> 02:34:07.92 Psychological warfare.
02:34:07.92 --> 02:34:08.92 You use it?
02:34:08.92 --> 02:34:09.92 I use it.
02:34:09.92 --> 02:34:10.92 Every day?
02:34:10.92 --> 02:34:11.92 When needed.
02:34:11.92 --> 02:34:12.92 Here's the thing.
02:34:12.92 --> 02:34:13.92 You can't use it every day.
02:34:13.92 --> 02:34:14.92 You know, you can't actually.
02:34:14.92 --> 02:34:15.92 You can't.
02:34:15.92 --> 02:34:16.92 I'm like a say, you can't use it every day.
02:34:16.92 --> 02:34:20.92 But the reason, the whole reason that I was like, hey, Jockel, what do you say?
02:34:20.92 --> 02:34:21.92 You know, when you're.
02:34:21.92 --> 02:34:22.92 Okay, you don't need every day.
02:34:22.92 --> 02:34:23.92 I don't need it every day.
02:34:23.92 --> 02:34:24.92 Okay.
02:34:24.92 --> 02:34:27.92 But it varies, you know, from season to season.
02:34:27.92 --> 02:34:30.92 So like, you know.
02:34:30.92 --> 02:34:37.42 So if you are coming up against moments of weakness, we have a little method to get you over
02:34:37.42 --> 02:34:38.42 to those haunts.
02:34:38.42 --> 02:34:39.42 Yeah.
02:34:39.42 --> 02:34:42.92 It's kind of like coaching a little bit.
02:34:42.92 --> 02:34:43.92 Psychopathic coach.
02:34:43.92 --> 02:34:44.92 Yeah.
02:34:44.92 --> 02:34:45.92 Psychoprosha.
02:34:45.92 --> 02:34:46.92 Yeah.
02:34:46.92 --> 02:34:47.92 Psychoprosha.
02:34:47.92 --> 02:34:48.92 Because it kind of.
02:34:48.92 --> 02:34:51.92 I played one of them from my seven year old daughter the other day.
02:34:51.92 --> 02:34:53.92 Because she's about to eat some candy or something.
02:34:53.92 --> 02:34:54.92 I was like, come here for a minute.
02:34:54.92 --> 02:34:55.92 Yeah.
02:34:55.92 --> 02:34:57.92 So I played her that one, you know, the snack time one.
02:34:57.92 --> 02:34:58.92 Yeah.
02:34:58.92 --> 02:34:59.92 She was.
02:34:59.92 --> 02:35:00.92 Yeah, sugar coated lies.
02:35:00.92 --> 02:35:01.92 She was.
02:35:01.92 --> 02:35:02.92 She was pretty impressed.
02:35:02.92 --> 02:35:04.92 But we'll impress me as later in the evening.
02:35:04.92 --> 02:35:05.92 She was kind of saying it.
02:35:05.92 --> 02:35:06.92 Yeah.
02:35:06.92 --> 02:35:07.92 I was.
02:35:07.92 --> 02:35:07.92 See?
02:35:07.92 --> 02:35:09.92 And that's what I was going to say where.
02:35:09.92 --> 02:35:10.92 You explain.
02:35:10.92 --> 02:35:11.92 It's like, cool.
02:35:11.92 --> 02:35:12.92 It's Jockel.
02:35:12.92 --> 02:35:13.92 Tell me to do this.
02:35:13.92 --> 02:35:15.92 So yes, I'll do it or not do it whatever.
02:35:15.92 --> 02:35:19.92 But you explain some some some good stuff like to to remember.
02:35:19.92 --> 02:35:22.92 You know, like then it's sugar coated lies.
02:35:22.92 --> 02:35:23.92 And that's kind of catchy too.
02:35:23.92 --> 02:35:24.92 So it sticks in your mind.
02:35:24.92 --> 02:35:25.92 Poison.
02:35:25.92 --> 02:35:29.92 So you can buy that on iTunes.
02:35:29.92 --> 02:35:30.92 Yes.
02:35:30.92 --> 02:35:31.92 It's somewhere else too, right?
02:35:31.92 --> 02:35:32.92 Google play.
02:35:32.92 --> 02:35:33.92 If you want it.
02:35:33.92 --> 02:35:36.92 And also everyone that asks for an alarm tone to wake up.
02:35:36.92 --> 02:35:37.92 That's it.
02:35:37.92 --> 02:35:38.92 That's it.
02:35:38.92 --> 02:35:39.92 It's there now.
02:35:39.92 --> 02:35:40.92 You don't have to ask anymore.
02:35:40.92 --> 02:35:41.92 You can just go to iTunes and get that cycle.
02:35:41.92 --> 02:35:43.92 Clear it with your wife or whoever you sleep with.
02:35:43.92 --> 02:35:45.92 Yeah, we've gotten something to be going to speak back on that one.
02:35:45.92 --> 02:35:46.92 Yeah.
02:35:46.92 --> 02:35:50.92 Because what happens is the alarm goes off if you haven't set then it's going to be my voice.
02:35:50.92 --> 02:35:54.92 And it's going to be weird because it sounds like there's some strange man in your room.
02:35:54.92 --> 02:35:55.92 It's a flood there in the morning.
02:35:55.92 --> 02:35:56.92 Which is kind of weird.
02:35:56.92 --> 02:35:57.92 Yeah.
02:35:57.92 --> 02:35:59.92 It's the only work at 430 a.m.
02:35:59.92 --> 02:36:03.92 Like, no, it's just it's just it's just an album.
02:36:03.92 --> 02:36:06.92 It's an album of tracks.
02:36:06.92 --> 02:36:13.92 And each track talks about some moment of week generally a moment of weakness that you have.
02:36:13.92 --> 02:36:15.92 Like, there's a one to wake up in the morning.
02:36:15.92 --> 02:36:19.92 There's ones to you know what you don't feel like going to the gym.
02:36:19.92 --> 02:36:22.92 There's ones you feel like you don't know.
02:36:22.92 --> 02:36:23.92 Don't eat the donut.
02:36:23.92 --> 02:36:24.92 There's one.
02:36:24.92 --> 02:36:26.92 I'm going to put this off for a while.
02:36:26.92 --> 02:36:27.92 I'm going to procrastinate.
02:36:27.92 --> 02:36:28.92 No, you're not going to procrastinate.
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:35.92 So all the little moments of weakness that we all have as humans can be countered using psychological warfare.
02:36:35.92 --> 02:36:38.92 Yeah, there's there's actually two on there.
02:36:38.92 --> 02:36:40.92 There's one called like, I think it's called like no more.
02:36:40.92 --> 02:36:42.92 It's basically like I'm not doing this in there.
02:36:42.92 --> 02:36:43.92 Yeah, no more.
02:36:43.92 --> 02:36:44.92 It's good one.
02:36:44.92 --> 02:36:48.92 That one's good because it puts in towards exactly like what you want to think.
02:36:48.92 --> 02:36:54.92 Like you know, because you always feel that like, you know how likely you know you're gaining some weight or I mean a lot of times you know why you're gaining weight.
02:36:54.92 --> 02:36:55.92 And so it's a little bit different.
02:36:55.92 --> 02:36:57.92 But you're like, you know what I'm not doing.
02:36:57.92 --> 02:37:01.92 I'm drinking is one where you wake up kind of hung over and you're like, I'm not drinking anymore.
02:37:01.92 --> 02:37:04.92 You know, like that thing, but you never really execute.
02:37:04.92 --> 02:37:07.92 Yeah, you know, and it's perfect because it sticks with you.
02:37:07.92 --> 02:37:12.92 You're like no more and then the other one was when you're talking about everyday.
02:37:12.92 --> 02:37:13.92 It's called everyday.
02:37:13.92 --> 02:37:14.92 Everyday.
02:37:14.92 --> 02:37:16.92 Everyday is a Monday that that one.
02:37:16.92 --> 02:37:18.92 Now it's dope.
02:37:18.92 --> 02:37:21.92 So you can get after that also.
02:37:21.92 --> 02:37:28.92 If you want to get some tea, if you're tea drink or if you're not a tea drink or you can get some chocolate, you can get it on Amazon.
02:37:28.92 --> 02:37:29.92 It's fully in stock.
02:37:29.92 --> 02:37:34.92 Y'all, those days of being out of stock, I think we've got them under control for now.
02:37:34.92 --> 02:37:37.92 And I won't make any promises because last time I made a promise.
02:37:37.92 --> 02:37:39.92 You guys went psycho.
02:37:39.92 --> 02:37:42.92 So I'm not going to make a promise, but you can get the chocolate tea.
02:37:42.92 --> 02:37:44.92 I figured out again, it doesn't.
02:37:44.92 --> 02:37:47.92 It doesn't taste like tea.
02:37:47.92 --> 02:37:49.92 Really, it doesn't taste like coffee.
02:37:49.92 --> 02:37:53.92 And for a long time, I was at a loss for words to describe what it tasted like.
02:37:53.92 --> 02:37:55.92 And I figured it out.
02:37:55.92 --> 02:37:58.92 I was responding to someone and I figured it out what it tastes like.
02:37:58.92 --> 02:38:00.92 And it's pretty simple.
02:38:00.92 --> 02:38:05.92 The chocolate tea tastes like victory.
02:38:05.92 --> 02:38:09.92 So if you need to.
02:38:09.92 --> 02:38:10.92 And we need to trade.
02:38:10.92 --> 02:38:12.92 I need to trade market.
02:38:12.92 --> 02:38:13.92 What?
02:38:13.92 --> 02:38:16.92 The fact that jocquoise tea tastes like victory.
02:38:16.92 --> 02:38:17.92 Boom.
02:38:17.92 --> 02:38:19.92 So get some of that.
02:38:19.92 --> 02:38:28.92 If you need to deadlift more, if you need to overhead squat more weights, this will increase all those numbers beyond anything you could have pulled for.
02:38:28.92 --> 02:38:31.92 You can drink it from a jocco mug.
02:38:31.92 --> 02:38:33.92 It says get after it on it.
02:38:33.92 --> 02:38:34.92 That's good.
02:38:34.92 --> 02:38:35.92 Oversize, by the way.
02:38:35.92 --> 02:38:36.92 Yeah, it's big.
02:38:36.92 --> 02:38:37.92 It's big.
02:38:37.92 --> 02:38:38.92 It's not.
02:38:38.92 --> 02:38:39.92 Somebody made the comment that it's not.
02:38:39.92 --> 02:38:42.92 It's not a joke.
02:38:42.92 --> 02:38:43.92 Yeah, it's not like clown shoes.
02:38:43.92 --> 02:38:44.92 No, it's not like clown shoes.
02:38:44.92 --> 02:38:45.92 No, it's not like clown shoes.
02:38:45.92 --> 02:38:46.92 It's not like clown shoes.
02:38:46.92 --> 02:38:49.92 It's big enough to, you know, it's like a pair of work.
02:38:49.92 --> 02:38:50.92 Boots as big as a pair of work.
02:38:50.92 --> 02:38:51.92 Boots as big as a pair of work.
02:38:51.92 --> 02:38:53.92 It will kick you in the ass.
02:38:53.92 --> 02:38:55.92 So it's that big.
02:38:55.92 --> 02:38:59.92 If you haven't got the book Extreme Ownership, you can pick that up there.
02:38:59.92 --> 02:39:00.92 It's about leadership.
02:39:00.92 --> 02:39:01.92 It's about combat leadership.
02:39:01.92 --> 02:39:05.92 I'm going to give my friend Peter T about three copies of it.
02:39:05.92 --> 02:39:06.92 Just to make sure he reads it.
02:39:06.92 --> 02:39:10.92 So if he has to deal with any sea players, you're going to step up his game of a little bit.
02:39:10.92 --> 02:39:11.92 Hopefully.
02:39:11.92 --> 02:39:13.92 I really have a free publication.
02:39:13.92 --> 02:39:14.92 That's right.
02:39:14.92 --> 02:39:15.92 I really missed that.
02:39:15.92 --> 02:39:19.92 We worked with a pre-pub, what does that mean before the book came out?
02:39:19.92 --> 02:39:21.92 Hey, here's what the book is.
02:39:21.92 --> 02:39:23.92 Okay, but it's still that's it.
02:39:23.92 --> 02:39:24.92 That's it.
02:39:24.92 --> 02:39:25.92 Yeah, it's not like you have the pretty stuff.
02:39:25.92 --> 02:39:26.92 It's a paper bag.
02:39:26.92 --> 02:39:27.92 Yeah, yeah.
02:39:27.92 --> 02:39:28.92 Yeah.
02:39:28.92 --> 02:39:29.92 It's a VIP.
02:39:29.92 --> 02:39:30.92 Yeah.
02:39:30.92 --> 02:39:31.92 Yeah.
02:39:31.92 --> 02:39:34.92 Hey, speaking of Extreme Ownership, we're having another monster.
02:39:34.92 --> 02:39:38.92 If you don't know what it is, check out the website, Extreme Ownership.com.
02:39:38.92 --> 02:39:40.92 It's going to be a New York City.
02:39:40.92 --> 02:39:45.92 So everyone can come because if you're on the East Coast, no matter where you're on the world,
02:39:45.92 --> 02:39:47.92 it's easy to get to New York.
02:39:47.92 --> 02:39:54.92 And May 4th and 5th, if you're a leader or you want to be a leader, come and get it.
02:39:54.92 --> 02:40:00.92 There's every level of leaders there, CEOs, middle-level managers.
02:40:00.92 --> 02:40:02.92 Every industry you can think of too.
02:40:02.92 --> 02:40:12.92 People that manufacture and finance and construction and health and pharmaceutical, and there's police there and fire and military and oil industry and entities to everybody.
02:40:12.92 --> 02:40:16.92 All working on leadership, talking about leadership.
02:40:16.92 --> 02:40:19.92 So, and I've said, it's going to sell out.
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:21.92 We're moving in that direction quickly.
02:40:21.92 --> 02:40:24.92 And Echo hasn't even released his videos yet because he's on Hawaii in time.
02:40:24.92 --> 02:40:25.92 No, no.
02:40:25.92 --> 02:40:26.92 Oh, you're not.
02:40:26.92 --> 02:40:28.92 No, I'm working diligently.
02:40:28.92 --> 02:40:29.92 And I'm going for quality.
02:40:29.92 --> 02:40:33.92 Not, you know.
02:40:33.92 --> 02:40:35.92 You're not going to put out any scrub material.
02:40:35.92 --> 02:40:37.92 Right.
02:40:37.92 --> 02:40:39.92 Once those videos come out, my feeling is going to sell very quickly.
02:40:39.92 --> 02:40:41.92 So get there now, sign up for it.
02:40:41.92 --> 02:40:47.92 If you need a police or fire discount or military discount or if you're going to be a group of people, I think the biggest group we had at the last one for one company was around 16 people.
02:40:47.92 --> 02:40:49.92 From one company or 12 people.
02:40:49.92 --> 02:40:52.92 But there's some pretty big numbers of companies that are showing up there.
02:40:52.92 --> 02:40:54.92 Come and get it.
02:40:54.92 --> 02:40:57.92 Echo, you got any closing comments.
02:40:57.92 --> 02:40:59.92 My pleasure.
02:40:59.92 --> 02:41:00.92 Oh, no.
02:41:00.92 --> 02:41:01.92 Other closing comments.
02:41:01.92 --> 02:41:02.92 Thank you.
02:41:02.92 --> 02:41:03.92 Other than it was your pleasure.
02:41:03.92 --> 02:41:04.92 Peter.
02:41:04.92 --> 02:41:05.92 Any closing comments?
02:41:05.92 --> 02:41:08.92 I would only echo Echo's comment.
02:41:08.92 --> 02:41:12.92 And that didn't even get planned until it came out.
02:41:12.92 --> 02:41:14.92 Perfect.
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:18.92 And if you want to continue these conversations with Peter.
02:41:18.92 --> 02:41:22.92 On Twitter, your Peter T.M.D.
02:41:22.92 --> 02:41:25.92 What are you on Facebook?
02:41:25.92 --> 02:41:28.92 Um, I don't know.
02:41:28.92 --> 02:41:30.92 Probably.
02:41:30.92 --> 02:41:32.92 You still have eating academy?
02:41:32.92 --> 02:41:33.92 Yeah.
02:41:33.92 --> 02:41:34.92 Probably.
02:41:34.92 --> 02:41:35.92 I don't do a lot.
02:41:35.92 --> 02:41:37.92 So Twitter is your most Twitter's pride.
02:41:37.92 --> 02:41:41.92 And I've been berated into doing something on Instagram.
02:41:41.92 --> 02:41:44.92 I just can't cope at the moment.
02:41:44.92 --> 02:41:45.92 Yeah.
02:41:45.92 --> 02:41:47.92 There's a way to connect the two.
02:41:47.92 --> 02:41:48.92 I've tried it.
02:41:48.92 --> 02:41:49.92 I don't like it.
02:41:49.92 --> 02:41:50.92 I do them separately.
02:41:50.92 --> 02:41:51.92 Yeah.
02:41:51.92 --> 02:41:53.92 You don't really connect Twitter to the Instagram.
02:41:53.92 --> 02:41:54.92 Yeah.
02:41:54.92 --> 02:41:55.92 I don't have any.
02:41:55.92 --> 02:41:56.92 I don't have any.
02:41:56.92 --> 02:41:57.92 I don't have any pictures to show.
02:41:57.92 --> 02:41:58.92 Right.
02:41:58.92 --> 02:41:59.92 I don't have anything to tell.
02:41:59.92 --> 02:42:01.92 Don't you have a bunch of watches?
02:42:01.92 --> 02:42:02.92 Yeah.
02:42:02.92 --> 02:42:04.92 I'm showing the same watch every day.
02:42:04.92 --> 02:42:06.92 Show that ring.
02:42:06.92 --> 02:42:07.92 How you were excited?
02:42:07.92 --> 02:42:08.92 I think it was all that.
02:42:08.92 --> 02:42:10.92 You could do like.
02:42:10.92 --> 02:42:11.92 Both pictures just on the right.
02:42:11.92 --> 02:42:12.92 I don't know.
02:42:12.92 --> 02:42:13.92 I don't know.
02:42:13.92 --> 02:42:15.92 What if my whole Instagram stick became this?
02:42:15.92 --> 02:42:17.92 Like my blood glucose.
02:42:17.92 --> 02:42:18.92 Yeah.
02:42:18.92 --> 02:42:19.92 That'd be pretty cool.
02:42:19.92 --> 02:42:20.92 And you kind of be interested.
02:42:20.92 --> 02:42:22.92 You could just, you could just, you could just,
02:42:22.92 --> 02:42:25.92 save that screen and post it up there.
02:42:25.92 --> 02:42:30.92 It's hard labor to save that thing and press submit to it.
02:42:30.92 --> 02:42:33.92 It actually has a little switch that you can just make it go.
02:42:33.92 --> 02:42:35.92 It's not that much work.
02:42:35.92 --> 02:42:36.92 I don't think about it.
02:42:36.92 --> 02:42:38.92 For somebody that's swimming 18 miles a year.
02:42:38.92 --> 02:42:39.92 I know.
02:42:39.92 --> 02:42:40.92 Talk about how you can see what you're going to do.
02:42:40.92 --> 02:42:41.92 It's a work to post.
02:42:41.92 --> 02:42:42.92 It's the grand picture.
02:42:42.92 --> 02:42:43.92 You got it.
02:42:43.92 --> 02:42:44.92 You got it.
02:42:44.92 --> 02:42:45.92 You got it.
02:42:45.92 --> 02:42:46.92 You got it.
02:42:46.92 --> 02:42:47.92 You got it.
02:42:47.92 --> 02:42:48.92 You got it.
02:42:48.92 --> 02:42:49.92 You got it.
02:42:49.92 --> 02:42:50.92 You got it.
02:42:50.92 --> 02:42:51.92 You got it.
02:42:51.92 --> 02:42:52.92 You got it.
02:42:52.92 --> 02:42:53.92 You got it.
02:42:53.92 --> 02:42:54.92 You got this.
02:42:54.92 --> 02:42:55.92 You got it.
02:42:55.92 --> 02:42:56.92 You know.
02:42:56.92 --> 02:42:58.92 So if you're going to be looking around that face.
02:42:58.92 --> 02:42:59.92 bulky.
02:42:59.92 --> 02:43:00.92 Not easy.
02:43:00.92 --> 02:43:01.92 We're going to be there.
02:43:01.92 --> 02:43:06.92 Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jackson Willink and again,
02:43:06.92 --> 02:43:11.92 I would like to thank you Peter for coming on and more important for everything
02:43:11.92 --> 02:43:17.40 You've done for me, which really the way it's connected all together getting me through
02:43:17.40 --> 02:43:23.90 to Tim Ferris, which was the book and get me on Jill Rogan, which led to this podcast.
02:43:23.90 --> 02:43:31.96 It's been awesome, so to you, and to Doc Kirk Parsley, for introducing us, but thank you
02:43:31.96 --> 02:43:34.24 and him for what you guys done for me.
02:43:34.24 --> 02:43:40.28 So, we've met in women in uniform out there holding the line.
02:43:40.28 --> 02:43:49.000 Thanks for your service and your sacrifice to the police on the corner, fighting crime, the
02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:50.70 firemen, fighting fires.
02:43:50.70 --> 02:43:52.28 Thanks for keeping us safe.
02:43:52.28 --> 02:44:01.24 To the medical people in the medical professions, like Peter, doctors, nurses, physicians,
02:44:01.24 --> 02:44:06.16 assistants, EMTs, all of you working to save lives.
02:44:06.16 --> 02:44:11.48 Thank you for your commitment to service, and it's obviously a massive commitment when you hear
02:44:11.48 --> 02:44:19.60 about the hours and the emotional trauma that it takes to go into any one of those
02:44:19.60 --> 02:44:23.16 industries and services.
02:44:23.16 --> 02:44:28.88 And to everybody else that's listening, thank you.
02:44:28.88 --> 02:44:36.64 That's your communications, your questions, your participation, your feedback and your
02:44:36.64 --> 02:44:44.40 spreading of the word that makes this possible, and it's what makes this worthwhile.
02:44:44.40 --> 02:44:50.48 So thank all of you for all of that.
02:44:50.48 --> 02:44:59.000 And finally, thanks to all of you for getting out there and getting after it.
02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:07.92 So until next time, this is Dr. Peter Etia, and Eko and Jocco.
02:45:07.92 --> 02:45:26.04 All of you staying out.
