00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocco podcast number 42 with echo Charles and me joccal willing

2
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:09.28
Good evening echo good evening

3
00:00:10.48 --> 00:00:12.48
now

4
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:14.48
in podcast

5
00:00:14.72 --> 00:00:16.48
number 11

6
00:00:16.48 --> 00:00:22.02
We brought on life-babbin who was the Charlie Platoon commander

7
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:28.76
Charlie Platoon was a part of task unit bruiser. Obviously, life is one of my brothers guy wrote the book

8
00:00:28.76 --> 00:00:30.76
Extreme ownership with so

9
00:00:32.16 --> 00:00:36.22
That's life Charlie Platoon and when he was on that first podcast

10
00:00:36.72 --> 00:00:40.36
We talked about a bunch of things, but one of the main focuses of our conversation

11
00:00:41.60 --> 00:00:43.60
was

12
00:00:43.60 --> 00:00:45.60
Some of the brothers that we lost

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.36
Mark Lee who is the first seal killed in Iraq

14
00:00:49.56 --> 00:00:51.56
We talked about big holes

15
00:00:52.68 --> 00:00:54.68
Ryan Job

16
00:00:54.68 --> 00:00:59.60
Who was gravely wounded in Ramadi and who later died after complications

17
00:01:00.24 --> 00:01:02.24
From a surgery to repair those wounds

18
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:05.40
then finally we talked about

19
00:01:06.40 --> 00:01:08.40
Chris Kyle who

20
00:01:08.84 --> 00:01:15.08
Was also in Charlie Platoon was the lead sniper and point man and who ended up writing the book American sniper

21
00:01:15.68 --> 00:01:20.72
Which was you know turned into a very successful movie and Chris as you know

22
00:01:20.72 --> 00:01:27.92
Was senselessly murdered as he tried to help out a fellow veteran and

23
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:35.84
On that podcast we didn't talk in any depth at all about

24
00:01:36.56 --> 00:01:38.56
Mikey Montsour

25
00:01:38.56 --> 00:01:42.64
Who is another one of our brother seals from task unit bruiser

26
00:01:43.40 --> 00:01:49.08
Who's also killed in Ramadi and if you don't know Mikey was posh and was the award at the Medal of Honor

27
00:01:49.08 --> 00:01:51.08
after he

28
00:01:51.44 --> 00:01:55.92
Smothered a grenade with his body in order to save three of our other teammates

29
00:01:58.44 --> 00:02:06.24
And one of the reasons I didn't want to focus on Mikey during that podcast is because Mike he was in Delta, but to

30
00:02:06.68 --> 00:02:11.72
As opposed to Charlie Ptun Charlie's two Patoons in the task unit Charlie and Delta and

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Charlie was

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.24
Life was the Patoon commander and Tony a Friday who was on the podcast as well. He was the the Patoon chief and before I

33
00:02:23.56 --> 00:02:27.16
Went and talked about Mikey. I wanted to bring somebody from Delta

34
00:02:27.72 --> 00:02:29.72
Platoon on the podcast

35
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:36.52
That's a little bit trickier than it sounds because most of the guys from Delta, but to our

36
00:02:37.56 --> 00:02:39.56
Still active duty and

37
00:02:39.56 --> 00:02:44.84
The ones that aren't active duty. I will they're not around. I couldn't get get hold of them or if I get it hold of them. They

38
00:02:47.16 --> 00:02:51.40
They were busy or I they were out in the area so it's just been hard. It's been a challenge

39
00:02:52.04 --> 00:02:54.04
but I get to want to wait and

40
00:02:54.76 --> 00:02:56.76
finally

41
00:02:58.36 --> 00:03:02.04
And today we're lucky because I got one of my one of my good bros here

42
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:08.92
Guy by the name of Andrew Paul who was the assistant platoon commander in Delta platoon

43
00:03:09.48 --> 00:03:11.48
Task unit bruiser seal team three

44
00:03:13.64 --> 00:03:15.24
But I wanted to start off today

45
00:03:16.68 --> 00:03:18.68
By reading a speech

46
00:03:19.40 --> 00:03:21.40
that I gave

47
00:03:21.40 --> 00:03:24.04
At one of the ceremonies that took place when Mikey

48
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Was awarded the Medal of Honor

49
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.76
And this was not the ceremony that took place at the White House with President Bush which

50
00:03:33.32 --> 00:03:38.04
Actually the entirety of Task unit bruiser did attend that and it was awesome

51
00:03:39.48 --> 00:03:47.16
But I gave this speech at a navy ceremony that took place. I think it took place later in the day or perhaps the next day

52
00:03:47.72 --> 00:03:50.76
At the navy memorial in Washington DC and

53
00:03:50.76 --> 00:03:55.32
That day there was a ton of senior naval officers in attendance and

54
00:03:57.24 --> 00:04:01.48
Basically the whole of the senior army of the of the navy was there

55
00:04:02.36 --> 00:04:06.92
You know this the chief naval operations in the sector in the navy and there was a bunch of other

56
00:04:07.48 --> 00:04:11.80
Medal of Honor winners there included a couple other seal Medal of Honor winners

57
00:04:13.48 --> 00:04:15.48
And it was a

58
00:04:16.60 --> 00:04:18.60
A very fitting day

59
00:04:18.60 --> 00:04:24.36
It was a great honor for me to be able to give this speech

60
00:04:27.48 --> 00:04:29.48
And here it is

61
00:04:31.88 --> 00:04:33.88
Ladies and gentlemen

62
00:04:34.84 --> 00:04:42.12
It is obviously very humbling to be here today as it was humbling to be on the battlefield of Ramadi with my fellow seals

63
00:04:42.12 --> 00:04:53.32
And the two two eight brigade combat team the iron soldiers and then the one one AD the ready first combat team

64
00:04:54.04 --> 00:04:59.64
Which was formed up by our brothers from the army navy air force and Marines

65
00:05:02.20 --> 00:05:08.36
And it included such hallowed units as the first to the 506 band of brothers

66
00:05:08.36 --> 00:05:13.32
The one three seven bandits and the three eight Marines

67
00:05:16.12 --> 00:05:22.84
I met Mike Montsore when he checked into seal team three as a new highly motivated young frog man

68
00:05:24.28 --> 00:05:29.40
As we trained and prepared to deploy to Iraq everyone learned that Mike was an incredible person

69
00:05:30.20 --> 00:05:34.68
He was gifted at everything he did hardworking funny and selfless

70
00:05:34.68 --> 00:05:41.40
He was the ultimate teammate the ultimate friend

71
00:05:45.72 --> 00:05:49.000
When Mike died a picture of him circulated in the news

72
00:05:50.84 --> 00:05:58.36
It showed Mike and his platoon mates in the war torn streets of Ramadi shrouded in a mist of greenish yellow smoke

73
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:01.000
Which was used to mask their movement from the enemy

74
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.44
That picture says so much

75
00:06:08.44 --> 00:06:15.96
Mike's gun is at the ready his face is calm almost smiling despite the obvious chaos and danger around him

76
00:06:17.80 --> 00:06:22.92
Ramadi at the time was the epicenter of the insurgency in Iraq a city filled with peril

77
00:06:24.04 --> 00:06:30.36
The hardened enemy was bent on destruction they fought with ruthlessness constantly on the attack with

78
00:06:30.36 --> 00:06:33.88
Machingons, mortars, grenades and IEDs

79
00:06:36.12 --> 00:06:39.32
Brave men died or wounded every day

80
00:06:40.84 --> 00:06:45.88
And every day brave men continue to push forward into the fray

81
00:06:48.12 --> 00:06:52.60
For those of us who were there that picture of Mike captures all of this

82
00:06:52.60 --> 00:06:58.52
In the picture his brother seals are nearby but Mike is out front

83
00:07:00.36 --> 00:07:04.44
I have looked at this picture over and over again and it speaks to me

84
00:07:06.04 --> 00:07:12.36
As someone that had the pleasure of knowing Mike he is a friend and had the honor of serving with him on the battle field

85
00:07:13.96 --> 00:07:15.96
This photograph tells me a story

86
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:20.44
As I look at that picture

87
00:07:20.44 --> 00:07:25.16
I hear a voice in a humble but confident tone

88
00:07:27.24 --> 00:07:29.24
This voice says to me

89
00:07:32.20 --> 00:07:33.72
I am Michael Monsour

90
00:07:35.32 --> 00:07:37.72
I am patrolling through the streets of Ramadi

91
00:07:38.60 --> 00:07:40.76
It is a city devastated by war

92
00:07:41.48 --> 00:07:44.20
Bullet holes cover the rubber rubble the buildings

93
00:07:45.24 --> 00:07:47.24
Burned out cars litter the streets

94
00:07:47.24 --> 00:07:50.92
I am walking just behind my point man

95
00:07:52.28 --> 00:07:53.24
I am ready

96
00:07:54.60 --> 00:07:56.60
My eyes sting from the sweat

97
00:07:57.24 --> 00:08:01.08
My gun and gear are heavy but these things do not bother me

98
00:08:02.52 --> 00:08:09.24
There is no comfort here but this is the life I have chosen and there is no other place I would rather be

99
00:08:11.64 --> 00:08:13.000
I am Michael Monsour

100
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:15.48
I pray and I believe

101
00:08:15.48 --> 00:08:20.20
My faith is my shelter my faith is my strength

102
00:08:21.80 --> 00:08:27.72
Fear thrives in this place but fear is no match for my faith faith conquerors all

103
00:08:29.56 --> 00:08:35.32
The word of the Lord proves true he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him

104
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:39.96
Lord protect my brothers above all else

105
00:08:39.96 --> 00:08:45.56
You have made me ready to protect them

106
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.52
I am Michael Monsour

107
00:08:48.52 --> 00:08:50.20
I am far away from home

108
00:08:50.20 --> 00:08:51.40
I miss my family

109
00:08:51.96 --> 00:08:55.40
I miss my mother my father my sister and my brothers

110
00:08:57.08 --> 00:08:59.72
Everything I am is rooted in them

111
00:09:00.92 --> 00:09:03.64
I want to hold my nephews and nieces again

112
00:09:03.64 --> 00:09:05.40
I want to make them smile and laugh

113
00:09:05.40 --> 00:09:09.40
But I am far away from home

114
00:09:11.40 --> 00:09:14.76
Instead I smile at the Iraqi children when we pass them by

115
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:19.40
When we encounter Iraqi families I treat them with respect and dignity

116
00:09:20.76 --> 00:09:26.44
I know the importance of family because there is nothing more important to me than my family

117
00:09:26.44 --> 00:09:34.44
I am Michael Monsour

118
00:09:34.44 --> 00:09:35.80
I love my country my fellow seals and the man fighting alongside us

119
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The man fighting alongside us in the streets are infantry men grunts

120
00:09:42.84 --> 00:09:49.24
I know these grunts are not just soldiers and marines but fathers and brothers and sons

121
00:09:49.24 --> 00:09:55.96
I know because my father and brother were also grunts proud marine riflemen

122
00:09:58.36 --> 00:10:03.88
We are fighting a determined enemy but we are strong our strength is our brotherhood

123
00:10:04.92 --> 00:10:08.92
Soldiers sailors, airmen and marines fighting together

124
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:13.64
A brotherhood bound by sweat and blood and tears

125
00:10:13.64 --> 00:10:21.64
Together we live in dust and dirt and filth and death

126
00:10:23.48 --> 00:10:25.48
Death is everywhere

127
00:10:25.88 --> 00:10:27.88
Many of my brothers have fallen

128
00:10:29.16 --> 00:10:31.40
Mark is gone

129
00:10:33.64 --> 00:10:34.84
But we fight on

130
00:10:36.04 --> 00:10:40.84
For the men to our left and right we fight on

131
00:10:40.84 --> 00:10:46.04
I'm so proud to be part of this band of brothers

132
00:10:48.44 --> 00:10:49.80
I am Michael Monsour

133
00:10:50.60 --> 00:10:51.56
I am ready

134
00:10:52.76 --> 00:10:54.92
Forged by faith and family

135
00:10:55.80 --> 00:10:57.80
Molded by belief and brotherhood

136
00:10:58.52 --> 00:11:00.52
I have lived life to its fullest

137
00:11:01.80 --> 00:11:03.16
I have not looked back

138
00:11:04.28 --> 00:11:06.28
I leave nothing but love

139
00:11:06.28 --> 00:11:09.000
And I have no regrets

140
00:11:11.32 --> 00:11:12.68
I am Michael Monsour

141
00:11:13.88 --> 00:11:16.36
I am the frogman on the high ground

142
00:11:19.40 --> 00:11:21.16
And I have given everything

143
00:11:22.60 --> 00:11:24.60
for you

144
00:11:24.60 --> 00:11:36.76
And that was the speech

145
00:11:40.12 --> 00:11:42.28
And I did my best to

146
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.60
Share my thoughts about Mikey

147
00:11:48.60 --> 00:11:53.000
And I am honored to have

148
00:11:55.64 --> 00:11:57.64
And you are all with me today

149
00:11:57.64 --> 00:12:01.32
Like I said the former assistant Patoon Commander from Delta Patoon

150
00:12:03.40 --> 00:12:04.76
To share some stories about

151
00:12:05.64 --> 00:12:08.68
Remodied about Mikey and about Tasking Abuser and about

152
00:12:09.40 --> 00:12:10.12
himself

153
00:12:10.84 --> 00:12:13.24
And the lessons that he learned over there

154
00:12:15.08 --> 00:12:16.84
And how he carried those lessons

155
00:12:16.84 --> 00:12:20.84
To civilian life and the kind of challenges he faced there

156
00:12:24.92 --> 00:12:25.24
So

157
00:12:26.92 --> 00:12:27.72
Andrew Paul

158
00:12:28.68 --> 00:12:29.24
My brother

159
00:12:30.20 --> 00:12:31.56
Welcome to the show

160
00:12:31.56 --> 00:12:33.000
Thanks for coming on

161
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.12
Thanks for having me, bro

162
00:12:35.16 --> 00:12:36.60
It's an honor to be here and you know

163
00:12:37.64 --> 00:12:40.20
The main thing, listen to that speech, I remember when you gave it

164
00:12:40.84 --> 00:12:43.72
My hope and prayer today is that whenever I do here today

165
00:12:43.72 --> 00:12:45.56
It honors as a legacy of our brothers

166
00:12:45.56 --> 00:12:47.56
Absolutely

167
00:12:47.56 --> 00:12:49.56
Absolutely

168
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:54.28
And we'll get into plenty of that

169
00:12:56.28 --> 00:12:59.80
But in order and I hate to do this because everybody does this when they start

170
00:13:00.52 --> 00:13:02.52
Like this type of situation

171
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:04.76
It's almost like a bar pickup line

172
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:06.36
You know, hey, where are you from?

173
00:13:06.36 --> 00:13:07.08
Right

174
00:13:07.08 --> 00:13:07.40
So

175
00:13:08.76 --> 00:13:10.76
That being said Andrew, so where are you from?

176
00:13:11.32 --> 00:13:11.88
Where am I from?

177
00:13:11.88 --> 00:13:13.08
From New England

178
00:13:13.08 --> 00:13:13.88
New Hampshire

179
00:13:13.88 --> 00:13:18.28
You know what we had Tony's Tony was just on another New England, that's right

180
00:13:18.28 --> 00:13:20.28
If I don't get some boys from Texas on here

181
00:13:20.28 --> 00:13:22.44
I'm gonna get I'm gonna get I'm gonna start here about it

182
00:13:22.44 --> 00:13:25.72
You're gonna be real hard to grow up in New England let me tell you it's cold

183
00:13:25.72 --> 00:13:26.68
Drew

184
00:13:27.40 --> 00:13:28.36
So so

185
00:13:29.24 --> 00:13:33.40
You grew up in New England and and by the way for those of you that just listen on the podcast

186
00:13:35.72 --> 00:13:36.52
What do you weigh?

187
00:13:36.52 --> 00:13:37.16
One

188
00:13:37.56 --> 00:13:42.52
155 155 so the the the image that everyone has of the big ABC

189
00:13:42.52 --> 00:13:48.92
You'll is not first of all it's not true. They're seals coming every shape and every size and Andrew comes in the smaller size

190
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:53.56
And so but how did you so so wait?

191
00:13:53.56 --> 00:13:57.88
How did you how did you have a hit how did you hear about the skills like what made you decide that that was what you wanted to do?

192
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:02.04
Yeah, you know, I'm first of all I've always been the kind of person that like tell me

193
00:14:02.04 --> 00:14:07.40
I can't do something and I'm gonna just show you so I mean things like oh we're in high school and someone says

194
00:14:07.40 --> 00:14:12.12
We're talking about like the Boston marathon and I'm like oh I'm gonna oh you can't do the marathon

195
00:14:12.12 --> 00:14:14.12
Oh, okay watch this

196
00:14:14.12 --> 00:14:16.12
Right the Boston marathon

197
00:14:16.12 --> 00:14:18.12
but you know

198
00:14:18.44 --> 00:14:24.28
Probably saw a movie because you know when I was growing up there wasn't a lot of information out there about the seal teams and so tell me about it

199
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:27.08
Right, I mean even less for an old guy like you

200
00:14:28.12 --> 00:14:30.52
So there wasn't a lot of information but somehow you know

201
00:14:30.76 --> 00:14:36.12
Probably saw a movie and it had breathing a book and then you know started to do some research and found well first of all

202
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
outside my immediate family

203
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.68
Uncle's grandfather all served in the military so grew up with that song strong sense of

204
00:14:45.40 --> 00:14:47.40
One into serve my country and

205
00:14:47.96 --> 00:14:51.56
Always had a sense of wanting to protect people who couldn't protect themselves

206
00:14:51.56 --> 00:14:58.04
So it was drawn to that kind of line of work then began to read about the seal teams and at least from what information

207
00:14:58.04 --> 00:14:59.000
I had available

208
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.68
It seemed like hey they were the best so I'm like all right. Well if that's the best them that's what I want to go do

209
00:15:02.68 --> 00:15:05.64
I know that was you know, yeah, it's infancy as it could be on kid

210
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:11.000
But then man and just got out of that like a bulldog bulldog on a pork shop and just I mean

211
00:15:11.56 --> 00:15:15.16
Tunnel vision went after it and you did you go to college?

212
00:15:15.48 --> 00:15:19.88
Did you already have that decision in your mind when you went to college? Oh, yeah, you knew you're gonna go to OCS

213
00:15:19.88 --> 00:15:25.32
You knew all that did you know I did ROTC so the thing is is that I don't know anything

214
00:15:25.32 --> 00:15:28.28
I mean I didn't know about I didn't know what ROTC was

215
00:15:28.28 --> 00:15:32.44
I didn't even know what in listing was I had no clue no would no no exposure

216
00:15:32.44 --> 00:15:37.48
I just knew I wanted to be a seal so you know, but we started looking at going to college and I went down

217
00:15:37.48 --> 00:15:42.20
And I looked at Vanderbilt University among others John Hopkins or RPI goes an engineering major

218
00:15:42.52 --> 00:15:45.96
And I knew nothing and also they walk into this almost like job fair

219
00:15:46.28 --> 00:15:49.56
Kind of style thing like welcome check out the school and there's this guy and uniform

220
00:15:49.56 --> 00:15:53.40
And these of course got a picture like some navy seal frog man coming out of the water over the beach

221
00:15:53.72 --> 00:15:57.32
And I was like hey, what's this realistic picture of all time right because that's what we do every day

222
00:15:58.12 --> 00:16:01.56
Right and I hate what's this he goes oh this is ROTC and what would say so what you

223
00:16:01.56 --> 00:16:07.48
Go to college we pay for college and then you go the navy and like wait you can be a seal through this program

224
00:16:07.48 --> 00:16:13.16
He's like oh yeah absolutely big lie like they take like 16 guys a year

225
00:16:13.24 --> 00:16:17.16
Yeah, but oh yeah, you can be a seal. Oh, okay. Let me get this straight so I go to college

226
00:16:17.96 --> 00:16:23.24
You pay for it watch this I get to go in the navy and I can be a seal. Yeah

227
00:16:23.24 --> 00:16:25.48
Oh my god, sorry me up so that's how I found out about ROTC

228
00:16:25.48 --> 00:16:31.64
Recruiter just straight truth from a recruiter you got to love it. That's right. Yeah. Yes. You can be a seal little did I know

229
00:16:32.12 --> 00:16:34.44
So you get done with

230
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.32
College get your commission you do ROTC

231
00:16:37.32 --> 00:16:40.20
Yeah, and then you go to go to Buds show up to Buds

232
00:16:40.92 --> 00:16:45.08
That was funny. I showed up so I asked the ROTC instructor hey

233
00:16:45.32 --> 00:16:50.84
You know like what's the process for checking in do I just like what should I wear? I'll just wear you know

234
00:16:50.84 --> 00:16:57.88
Proprits of the entire so I show up to the Buds quarter deck and like a college shirt

235
00:16:58.44 --> 00:17:01.000
Walk onto the quarter deck and one of the most

236
00:17:01.24 --> 00:17:05.80
sadistic instructors possible happen to be standing there. I walk on and my hey

237
00:17:06.44 --> 00:17:08.44
Yeah, I'm here to check in like

238
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.40
Like the all-seeing I just like

239
00:17:11.64 --> 00:17:15.88
Glances like you said what I'll so I'm checking into Buds

240
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:22.20
Wearing that I'm like maybe I should go put in for money. Yeah, good idea

241
00:17:22.92 --> 00:17:28.36
Run out to my car three minutes of your uniform son right went on put on my STBs

242
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.80
Came back promptly got wet and sanding. Yeah, that's how it works. Yeah STBs

243
00:17:33.80 --> 00:17:39.48
Because you don't know it's like the the high level uniform with all the ribbons and all that crap on it

244
00:17:39.48 --> 00:17:44.20
And you got to you know you got to take a care of it so when you take that and you wear it down to the ocean and then you

245
00:17:44.20 --> 00:17:48.36
Jump in the ocean and roll around in the sand. It's not a good deal. So that's a good news

246
00:17:48.36 --> 00:17:51.16
There weren't a lot of ribbons on there yet. Yeah, yeah one ribbons

247
00:17:52.76 --> 00:17:57.40
So so and you end up going through Buds with life, right which people know who life is obviously

248
00:17:58.52 --> 00:18:03.000
Which is cool and then you get done with buds any I mean buds is buds

249
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.44
I don't know the care about buds. Yeah, that's some funny late stories though

250
00:18:07.72 --> 00:18:12.44
Talk about my bro. So I got I got pneumonia in hell week first time through so I got rollback

251
00:18:12.44 --> 00:18:16.12
Start over so and then and then life

252
00:18:16.84 --> 00:18:24.60
Transfer then so life was our was our class leader and so me the Delta-Platin commander who one day you'll hear from

253
00:18:25.72 --> 00:18:30.84
And he and I we all went through Buds together, but they were both lateral transfers and so they were senior to me and rank

254
00:18:30.84 --> 00:18:33.40
Right, they're already like JJ and a full lieutenant and

255
00:18:34.04 --> 00:18:40.84
So there's games and buds right like you're trying to win so you know we were we were wise to the games already to try and win in

256
00:18:40.84 --> 00:18:46.84
Lave if you know by brother is like life is black in white with my brother way

257
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.64
Okay, so I'm gonna hear about this one, but he so you know it's right and it's wrong and there's like and so we know we're like

258
00:18:53.64 --> 00:18:57.48
You know and buds sort of like if you ain't cheating you ain't trying and if you got you ain't trying hard enough

259
00:18:57.48 --> 00:19:02.04
I mean so and there's an element of that and buds obviously not completely, but so you know

260
00:19:02.04 --> 00:19:08.52
We're we're pulling all kinds of games and his book who is losing because we are just we're cheating to win and

261
00:19:08.52 --> 00:19:09.88
And

262
00:19:09.88 --> 00:19:15.24
He's getting so pissed like after the race like after class. He's like okay, you got and then he finally wasn't up and started playing

263
00:19:15.80 --> 00:19:23.32
Yeah, that thing about you ain't cheating you ain't trying that sort of a that's sort of one side of buds right and what was cool is when I went through Buds

264
00:19:23.72 --> 00:19:26.52
They actually told us like these couple instructors were like listen

265
00:19:27.40 --> 00:19:32.12
That's a little saying it's not true right and they they actually said if you're cheating

266
00:19:32.12 --> 00:19:38.36
You're cheating yourself right which I was and then obviously then they start saying look if you got guys that are cheating here

267
00:19:38.44 --> 00:19:42.12
To get through this training. Yeah, you really want them in the teams with you. No, right?

268
00:19:42.12 --> 00:19:47.48
I don't want a guy that that has to cheat to complete a run or swim negative. Yeah, I mean that there's there was

269
00:19:47.48 --> 00:19:50.92
It's been like cheating like cutting off the run versus like you're in competition

270
00:19:50.92 --> 00:19:55.96
You're knocking the other guy whatever you know competing hitting a guy in the face of the paddle just that type of thing

271
00:19:55.96 --> 00:19:57.000
Right

272
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.88
So you get done so you get done because you were junior when you get to the T you went right to team three

273
00:20:01.88 --> 00:20:05.40
Right, yeah, so you get to team three, but you don't get to go on to point with team three

274
00:20:05.56 --> 00:20:12.04
They hook you up with being a boat unit commander. Yeah, so no one's gonna know what that is all right

275
00:20:12.04 --> 00:20:14.04
So so the deal wasn't and

276
00:20:14.76 --> 00:20:18.76
This is changed throughout the years, but like when I checked into team three

277
00:20:19.16 --> 00:20:22.44
There was this brief period of time where was in charge of the time decided that

278
00:20:22.84 --> 00:20:26.76
Third dose and a opportunity was a bad idea for off-sort of element. This is no more third dose

279
00:20:27.40 --> 00:20:29.16
so

280
00:20:29.16 --> 00:20:32.76
Basically I was faced with being a

281
00:20:33.24 --> 00:20:35.24
Talk jockey or

282
00:20:35.96 --> 00:20:39.96
Going over to the boat team and at least being a judge or something to get some leadership experience

283
00:20:39.96 --> 00:20:43.08
So I went over to the special boat team which is part of the Naval Special Warfare and

284
00:20:43.56 --> 00:20:50.84
Ultimately when they deploy the deploy as part of the task unit and are the task group and it's all integrated in part of

285
00:20:51.32 --> 00:20:54.44
You know visit board searches see-jure maritime operations such as

286
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Leadership interdiction maritime interdiction operations and so the boat unit which is

287
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Special boat teams is

288
00:21:02.36 --> 00:21:08.84
Run essentially at the at the leadership level by seals so the commanding officer the boat unit the executive officer is our

289
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.68
Seals the boat that OIC is the Mark Files all of it. I'll have Mark Fives anymore

290
00:21:13.48 --> 00:21:18.52
Our seal officers so look as a brand new officer at least had an opportunity to deploy in a

291
00:21:19.56 --> 00:21:24.92
In a combat zone to lead men and end to work with my seal brothers who were conducting operations in the northern region go

292
00:21:24.92 --> 00:21:28.36
Yeah, and just an overview. I was gonna sum this up as quickly as I can

293
00:21:28.36 --> 00:21:37.48
So obviously seals work on water a lot and we we drive our own little bullets our own little you know 12 foot Zodiac boats with 55

294
00:21:37.48 --> 00:21:40.20
Horse power motors on them or 35 horse power motors on them or whatever

295
00:21:40.76 --> 00:21:44.84
But the bigger boats we don't we don't drive those so anything you know

296
00:21:44.84 --> 00:21:50.20
You see any of those bigger boats are driven by these guys that are called they're now called

297
00:21:50.60 --> 00:21:55.08
Special warfare combat and crewmen which are guys that that's what they do their boat drivers

298
00:21:55.08 --> 00:22:01.000
So they do they insert an extract us no drop there drop there boats out of

299
00:22:01.56 --> 00:22:08.36
Various aircraft it's so it's a legit job and they and then that's what they do and so you were in charge of a group of those guys

300
00:22:08.36 --> 00:22:13.16
Took boats on deployment right to the rabbing golf and did what you did over there

301
00:22:13.72 --> 00:22:20.44
Right the reality is is not the it's not the dream for the seal young seal officer to be that to do that

302
00:22:20.44 --> 00:22:27.40
But it's a good like you said it's good all of a sudden you're in charge of some real you know, right you're when you're out of the water and I tell people

303
00:22:27.40 --> 00:22:30.60
I you tell people us when I was in the team to say listen when you're on the water

304
00:22:30.76 --> 00:22:34.20
It's a real world Bob because because if someone goes wrong when you're in the water

305
00:22:34.20 --> 00:22:37.24
I'm got first of all you can drown you could that's and you can get lost

306
00:22:37.24 --> 00:22:40.84
There's all kinds of bad things that happen so if you don't plan right on the water doesn't matter

307
00:22:40.84 --> 00:22:43.64
If there's enemy or not you got a big giant enemy

308
00:22:43.64 --> 00:22:48.52
It's called the ocean and they will kill you if you're not square it away and I think actually

309
00:22:48.52 --> 00:22:51.64
That's one of the things that makes seals good is that we work in the water and the water

310
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:54.92
So one of the toughest enemies you come up so one forget it's on the tree

311
00:22:54.92 --> 00:23:02.28
Yeah, so that wraps up that you come home from that deployment. Yep, and now you are still a sealed team three

312
00:23:02.60 --> 00:23:04.52
Or you go back to seal team three

313
00:23:04.52 --> 00:23:09.32
I guess technically yeah, and now we form up and you become the Delta Pultune

314
00:23:10.20 --> 00:23:11.96
Assistant Pultune commander

315
00:23:12.12 --> 00:23:17.000
Checking it awesome working for the Delta Pultune commander who you you guys were rose are were bros

316
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.84
Yeah, we've known each other for years went through buds together and life

317
00:23:20.84 --> 00:23:25.08
So you guys must have been pretty stoked on that it was cool. It's kind of like getting the band back together

318
00:23:25.08 --> 00:23:28.60
You know, and those and look those two guys had just come off of

319
00:23:29.24 --> 00:23:36.04
Not the greatest deployments either in terms of a junior officer seal right because they were deployed and they were the Assistant commanders

320
00:23:36.04 --> 00:23:41.56
And they were getting stuck with not so fun work, you know, so that we were stoked to be all right

321
00:23:41.80 --> 00:23:43.40
They were so close. Hey now

322
00:23:43.40 --> 00:23:44.60
We're the OIC

323
00:23:44.60 --> 00:23:48.84
We're not gonna be the guy stuck back doing the paperwork and we're getting the band back together

324
00:23:48.84 --> 00:23:54.20
And then we found out you are our task unit commander. It was like oh, because we we all knew we were gonna be in the Pultune together

325
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:57.08
And the task unit together. We didn't know who our TU commander was gonna be yet

326
00:23:57.32 --> 00:24:01.64
And then we were all those room or room or who are we gonna get and then we heard this guy jacco was coming over

327
00:24:01.64 --> 00:24:04.36
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

328
00:24:04.60 --> 00:24:08.52
I only knew who you were through them like one other guys like this. Oh, jacco

329
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.20
That asked do this is gonna be awesome right because like we already had an inkling that like if if this dude was gonna be

330
00:24:14.20 --> 00:24:16.44
To you commander, we had our best shot again didn't combat

331
00:24:17.56 --> 00:24:21.08
Although we had no idea what was about to happen good assessment. Yeah

332
00:24:22.36 --> 00:24:27.000
Yeah, your reputation was great, but you were coming over in that case for being the

333
00:24:27.48 --> 00:24:32.12
Admiralments coming from being the Admiralments. Yeah, yeah 13 months with with the Admiralment which was a

334
00:24:33.72 --> 00:24:35.72
A rough tour in terms of

335
00:24:36.36 --> 00:24:41.40
Things that normal seals same thing right like to do that's right and I and and

336
00:24:41.40 --> 00:24:46.44
You know for instance, I mean just just straight up wearing uniform every single day

337
00:24:46.44 --> 00:24:49.48
Wait, so people don't so people understand in the world

338
00:24:50.28 --> 00:24:54.60
When and I don't know what it's like this moment today when I was in the team so now is it

339
00:24:54.60 --> 00:24:58.44
Seal team one seal team two seal team seven we I didn't wear shirt

340
00:24:59.16 --> 00:25:03.16
Like no, I'm a 35 year old man making money doing with a family

341
00:25:03.16 --> 00:25:06.20
I'm not wearing a shirt at work like oh, I'm in my office cool. I'm not wearing a shirt

342
00:25:06.20 --> 00:25:08.52
I wear shorts and a pair of jungle boots, right that's it

343
00:25:08.52 --> 00:25:13.96
So I do that for my whole life right since I was a kid since I was a 19 year old kid

344
00:25:14.28 --> 00:25:20.12
When I got through but so I now I go to be the Admirals aid and I have to wear uniform every day

345
00:25:20.36 --> 00:25:28.68
Not just one uniform. I have to wear cackies then whites then blues and you're just in this constant uniform and and seals are not good about

346
00:25:29.40 --> 00:25:32.36
Uniforms they're just not it's not one of our strong points and

347
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:36.36
So so that's one of the things that made the job

348
00:25:36.36 --> 00:25:39.88
Not very fun, but there's a good lesson there, right? So here

349
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:43.16
I mean everybody knows you as an incredible leader

350
00:25:43.72 --> 00:25:49.32
Awesome seal and yet for this period of time you had to do this job that was not particularly fun

351
00:25:49.32 --> 00:25:52.68
Kind of like you know, I had to go over and be the the seal at the boat unit, right?

352
00:25:52.68 --> 00:25:58.28
But do life is full of things like that and when you were part of the team no matter what you do it to the best of your ability

353
00:25:58.28 --> 00:26:01.000
And you didn't awesome job as the Admirals aid

354
00:26:01.40 --> 00:26:04.36
Not necessarily what you wanted to do being a tried and wearing frog

355
00:26:04.36 --> 00:26:07.08
So I got an email from

356
00:26:07.80 --> 00:26:15.64
One of the assistant platoon commanders in Charlie Patoon a year ago and he said hey bro

357
00:26:16.12 --> 00:26:18.12
I'm gonna go be the aid yeah

358
00:26:19.96 --> 00:26:24.52
And so he I just saw him and he was laughing he goes your email back to me you said

359
00:26:25.24 --> 00:26:30.68
This is going to be very hard for you because you're not good at this kind of thing and I was pretty good at it

360
00:26:30.68 --> 00:26:34.92
So you're gonna have to work like extra hard to make this happen and he was laughing we're both laughing

361
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:40.60
Yeah, because you know what I'm talking about it. He's not a guy that is all over the the my new ship

362
00:26:40.60 --> 00:26:42.84
Of course he did a great job because he stepped up his game

363
00:26:43.32 --> 00:26:48.28
But yeah when you get a task with something you do it and you do it the best your ability and and you know

364
00:26:48.28 --> 00:26:52.60
Just to continue that story because I have to say this it was it was a pain the ass job

365
00:26:52.84 --> 00:26:59.000
It wasn't fun for me, but man did I learn a lot did I understand a lot did I get to know

366
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.96
All the inner workings of of the community because I was there with the guy you know with the amylets and charge of all the seals

367
00:27:05.96 --> 00:27:07.96
I was with him

368
00:27:07.96 --> 00:27:14.76
For 13 months. I mean all day travel. You know wake up PT. We were just I'm every meeting, you know

369
00:27:14.76 --> 00:27:20.60
So it was it was a great learning experience for me and I was appreciative and he was a great guy

370
00:27:20.60 --> 00:27:24.52
He's a great guy now and he really cared about the seal platoon

371
00:27:24.52 --> 00:27:29.48
Which is which is awesome when a guy puts the no more priority. He'd always talk about okay

372
00:27:29.48 --> 00:27:33.24
What's the seal platoon need or how does this affect the seal platoon? Yeah, so

373
00:27:34.12 --> 00:27:37.64
Then we got it and now you're in your first workup right going through workup

374
00:27:38.60 --> 00:27:42.44
Getting your game on awesome best time my life

375
00:27:43.32 --> 00:27:47.08
Awesome yeah anybody's in the military right now in act of duty

376
00:27:47.40 --> 00:27:52.20
Teamed if you're listening to this band just enjoy it man enjoy it. I mean there's other things in life

377
00:27:52.20 --> 00:27:55.48
Sure, but like you can you just you can't replace that time

378
00:27:55.96 --> 00:28:01.32
It and there's stupid stuff you deal with yes, but trust me enjoy this man

379
00:28:01.72 --> 00:28:05.32
You won't find it anywhere else nothing like that awesome

380
00:28:06.28 --> 00:28:08.28
Yeah, do you what do you I?

381
00:28:08.28 --> 00:28:11.32
I talk about this sometimes so one of the

382
00:28:12.12 --> 00:28:15.32
Scars that you get from the militant from the seal teams

383
00:28:15.32 --> 00:28:23.96
Hmm is if you go if you like to shoot weapons still oh yeah and you want to go shooting you have to pay for ammunition

384
00:28:25.16 --> 00:28:33.56
I'm serious I remember times in the seal teams where I mean your your thumbs are getting your thumbs are literally

385
00:28:33.56 --> 00:28:39.64
Getting sore from reloading magazines for days and days you're shooting all the all the bullets you could possibly

386
00:28:39.80 --> 00:28:44.60
Ever ever want to shoot ever you're gonna shoot them all in a week or two weeks

387
00:28:44.60 --> 00:28:48.04
And so it's it's so fun. Yeah, it's so fun

388
00:28:49.32 --> 00:28:53.64
And you know for us and for those of you don't know see you go through a work up prior going on deployment

389
00:28:53.64 --> 00:28:57.08
Which is now you're working together for the first time this is when I'm getting to know you guys

390
00:28:57.08 --> 00:29:02.28
You guys are getting to know me we're all getting to know each other where the whole the whole unit is coming together as a team

391
00:29:02.28 --> 00:29:08.48
And this is where the real bond forms and you're doing super hard training

392
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:13.28
You're you're living together you're working out together you're working together

393
00:29:13.28 --> 00:29:17.56
You're partying together you're eating your meals together. It's just a 24-7 rock and roll

394
00:29:17.84 --> 00:29:24.08
Awesome this and and that's how that's how it that's how you get to know these guys that's how you get to know your

395
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:31.84
Your your team. Yep, so me Mikey and another guy were the we're the new guys in that

396
00:29:31.84 --> 00:29:36.24
Platoon one other guy. He saw an act of duty. Yeah, yeah

397
00:29:36.24 --> 00:29:43.76
I'm just saying there was only three new guys in that platoon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and our and and and and and Delta and Delta. Yeah

398
00:29:45.20 --> 00:29:49.04
Needless to say Delta and Charlie were of slightly different dynamic

399
00:29:49.84 --> 00:29:52.08
Yeah, you guys were you guys are a different dynamic

400
00:29:53.20 --> 00:29:59.44
Different just like people have different personalities full tunes have different personalities and teams have different personalities and they can more from change

401
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.36
but

402
00:30:01.36 --> 00:30:03.04
Nonetheless

403
00:30:03.04 --> 00:30:03.84
Both great

404
00:30:03.84 --> 00:30:11.04
Pltunes both yeah, oh yeah, and so it was only you and Mikey in one of the guys. Yeah, I know who the other guy was. Yeah

405
00:30:12.16 --> 00:30:17.04
The tick you guys were only only three new guys. Yeah, yep, so it's can be a harsh

406
00:30:18.64 --> 00:30:24.08
It's it's it's a harsh environment to come into when you're when you're a new guy

407
00:30:24.08 --> 00:30:29.84
I see up to but I saw him with so I'm with Mikey and we're doing we're just I don't even think we're doing mobility

408
00:30:29.84 --> 00:30:32.48
but we are driving out to the ranges and

409
00:30:32.48 --> 00:30:37.12
He's the uh he's the turk on right and

410
00:30:38.96 --> 00:30:42.16
I say something to him like hey when we're approaching a road, you know

411
00:30:42.80 --> 00:30:47.12
You look at your field of fire and if there's no vehicles coming you know say clear right

412
00:30:48.40 --> 00:30:53.60
And so he did it once and he's clear right you know kind of quiet now's like hey man

413
00:30:54.32 --> 00:30:58.80
You got to sound off the drivers try to drive he's got it. He's got radio on he's he needs to know what's going on man

414
00:30:58.80 --> 00:31:03.44
You need to sound off yeah and the next in her second got to he's a

415
00:31:04.16 --> 00:31:08.64
Right he said it super loud and I thought to myself wait a second is he is he

416
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:15.28
You know taking a piss out of me is he is he being sarcastic with that yell right no and no

417
00:31:15.28 --> 00:31:21.44
He was not no I told me yell he was like okay we right I will yell I will yell and that's that's the way it worked

418
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:29.20
Did the other one of my other favorite stories about Mikey was and his another like new guy related story was

419
00:31:29.68 --> 00:31:31.68
So you go through

420
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:35.28
CQC training close quarter combat close quarter battle

421
00:31:35.76 --> 00:31:37.44
Whatever it's basically shooting in small

422
00:31:38.16 --> 00:31:41.92
Spaces taking down buildings that kind of thing and it's it's a

423
00:31:43.68 --> 00:31:45.44
There's there's a lot of

424
00:31:45.44 --> 00:31:53.76
Instructor focus oh yeah on the mechanics of what you're doing so it's a very it's a very mechanical thing and if you if you're making mistakes

425
00:31:53.76 --> 00:31:56.80
It's not gonna work out good for you and by the way as a new guy

426
00:31:56.80 --> 00:32:00.56
There's tough scrutiny but the reality is it doesn't matter if you're new or not like they're watching

427
00:32:00.56 --> 00:32:03.76
We have everybody's getting watched you could be a third-platoon guy and get

428
00:32:04.24 --> 00:32:08.96
Can from the platoon first-a-fifth evaluation and you get a safety evaluation in two seconds. He's not there in you know half a second

429
00:32:08.96 --> 00:32:13.92
Yeah, it doesn't take much so and and what they're trying to do is they're trying to put more stress on you right

430
00:32:13.92 --> 00:32:19.28
Because they want them they want you to handle the stress so they stress people out by just

431
00:32:19.68 --> 00:32:25.44
You know these little minute details of what you do right around and they'll be honest with you

432
00:32:25.84 --> 00:32:31.04
Some of them no matter some of you're like okay, that doesn't matter you and and I know they don't matter because they they more

433
00:32:31.04 --> 00:32:33.04
Over time and they'll teach you know

434
00:32:33.12 --> 00:32:34.16
ones

435
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:39.76
Phase they'll be teaching one thing and then if later they'll teach the phase they'll teach another thing then later they'll teach another thing

436
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:41.28
So it's not

437
00:32:41.28 --> 00:32:43.28
There's a million different ways to do yeah and

438
00:32:44.96 --> 00:32:48.000
You could argue this one's better, but there's a million different ways to do it

439
00:32:48.32 --> 00:32:53.54
But they do they pick whatever they're gonna choose for that block of training is what you're gonna do and

440
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.48
And if you want to sit there and argue with them

441
00:32:56.48 --> 00:32:58.72
Oh boy there's not gonna work out good for you

442
00:32:58.72 --> 00:33:01.88
So what I told all the new guys and Delta and Charlie Ptune I said well, hey listen

443
00:33:02.24 --> 00:33:09.48
When the instructor cadre is telling you to do something or they're yelling at you or they're getting on your ass about something you just look at him and say Roger that

444
00:33:09.48 --> 00:33:11.48
Oh

445
00:33:11.48 --> 00:33:16.20
You guys got it Roger that and these guys are like Roger that and that's the one that it's you want to have right?

446
00:33:16.20 --> 00:33:17.88
Because what do you want what do you want to be a new guy?

447
00:33:17.88 --> 00:33:24.52
That's like hey, no, I don't agree with your tactics there person. That's deployed you know overseas 14 times no you don't want to be that guy

448
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.28
You might think you're right, but no, this is what you know, that's not what you want to do

449
00:33:28.28 --> 00:33:33.000
So I told you guys to say Roger that so we're going through the training the training great and we're

450
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:38.000
Doing really well our task units doing great. You know, but still guys are guys are making mistakes

451
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.76
Whatever and finally the master chief and I'm of course for like Tony and I were friends with all the cadre guys because they're all our bros from being in teams and

452
00:33:47.36 --> 00:33:49.36
One of the the leader guy

453
00:33:49.36 --> 00:33:51.36
He comes up to me and he's like hey

454
00:33:52.28 --> 00:33:54.28
He's hard, but yes guys

455
00:33:54.28 --> 00:33:56.000
He goes hey

456
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.58
What's up with this guy monster and I was like I don't what what do you mean? What's up? He's been doing a good job. What's up? He goes every time I tell him something

457
00:34:02.58 --> 00:34:04.58
All he does just look at me and say Roger that

458
00:34:04.58 --> 00:34:10.50
Yeah, I go hey brother, you know what he's doing exactly what I told you

459
00:34:10.50 --> 00:34:15.50
I literally told them the only thing I wanted him to say to you guys or want anything you guys to say to you guys

460
00:34:15.50 --> 00:34:18.78
Was Roger that and make an app so when we were out there there was

461
00:34:19.34 --> 00:34:24.50
Another platoon that was there at the same time. Do you remember this they were in and I

462
00:34:25.06 --> 00:34:33.22
I'm pretty sure the chief got canned from a platoon. Yeah, he saved you violation and there was some and there was that talking back going on right like hey

463
00:34:33.22 --> 00:34:38.82
I've got three deployments under my belt and you know, there's a degree of humility in that Roger that response right

464
00:34:38.82 --> 00:34:43.14
That's what it's like it's it's Roger that. I'm open to the correction you have for me

465
00:34:43.14 --> 00:34:45.54
Yeah, for sure and so and these guys

466
00:34:45.54 --> 00:34:50.90
You know him's on the platoon and there's a balance there. I mean he's leading us platoon and taking a stand for you know

467
00:34:50.90 --> 00:34:56.18
And being in charge put the same time like there's a humility and a respect in that response and he was not doing that

468
00:34:56.18 --> 00:34:57.54
And I'm telling you like he

469
00:34:57.54 --> 00:35:04.10
Screwed some things up and they saved you review board. I remember about holding a safety review board for the chief of that platoon

470
00:35:04.10 --> 00:35:11.02
Yeah, not our task unit, but it did they do not play around no and and that's the way it's supposed to be right because it's intense

471
00:35:11.02 --> 00:35:15.86
And what people don't get is that you're trying to recreate the intensity of combat as best you can

472
00:35:15.86 --> 00:35:21.98
So they're creating high stress situations as stressful as possible and like you said sometimes creating

473
00:35:21.98 --> 00:35:28.30
Elements that aren't necessarily real, but just to overload you with a number of things you have to process under pressure

474
00:35:28.30 --> 00:35:33.18
And then are you gonna make good decisions under pressure and that right there is what

475
00:35:33.90 --> 00:35:39.34
Translates to combat good decisions under stress and under pressure. Yeah, yeah, and

476
00:35:40.70 --> 00:35:42.94
You're right though about that humility piece and

477
00:35:43.66 --> 00:35:48.90
That was all attitude going through right you know what I mean between me Tony

478
00:35:48.90 --> 00:35:53.54
I don't think there was I'm just trying to think if there's any instructor cadre that was putting us through

479
00:35:54.18 --> 00:35:56.72
Right, you know, I get there was some guys that were it's you know

480
00:35:56.72 --> 00:36:01.46
And the stupid was it wasn't like there was someone that was just you know had tons more experience than the two of us

481
00:36:01.46 --> 00:36:03.46
Right and

482
00:36:03.46 --> 00:36:08.50
Yeah, we you know both Tony and I hit Roger that yeah, hey sounds good will will make that adjustment because

483
00:36:08.74 --> 00:36:13.14
You know what and it's great just having Tony on the other day. He was just saying look

484
00:36:13.14 --> 00:36:19.54
You can I'm learning something new all the time learning something from the new guys, and that's the attitude that prevailed through the task

485
00:36:19.54 --> 00:36:21.54
You know not of hey

486
00:36:21.78 --> 00:36:26.58
Where the best we don't have to listen to anybody, but hey, we're gonna work as hard as we can

487
00:36:27.14 --> 00:36:31.62
We're gonna be the best we can, but we're we got open minds that we're ready to learn at all times

488
00:36:31.62 --> 00:36:36.14
It's a fine line between confident and cocky no doubt about and and being humble

489
00:36:36.14 --> 00:36:42.50
You can be confident you can be sure and you can be humble and respectful and open to learning new things and maybe based a present which you learn

490
00:36:42.50 --> 00:36:44.50
Yeah, there's no doubt about that so

491
00:36:45.70 --> 00:36:47.70
What else do you remember from

492
00:36:48.70 --> 00:36:54.98
Work up in terms of hey you're a new guy you're checking in you know Tony and I told some stories of what it was like when we were checking in team one

493
00:36:54.98 --> 00:36:57.74
It was when we were new guys it was a very

494
00:36:58.58 --> 00:37:04.38
Ruff environment to roll right into yeah, what did you think when you got to you know being a new guy? Well

495
00:37:05.58 --> 00:37:11.30
I remember like literally day first of all day one that I was checking into the platoon space

496
00:37:11.30 --> 00:37:15.82
I got like the combo to the platoon space right now went in and I'm man brand new and

497
00:37:16.26 --> 00:37:20.36
So I'm gonna be protective of my platoon you know, so I go in I'm walking out of the platoon space

498
00:37:20.36 --> 00:37:26.38
Making sure the door is locked behind me because you know other platoon guys go in and just destroy another guy's platoon space

499
00:37:26.38 --> 00:37:30.70
forever and I'm walking down the hallway and our LPO

500
00:37:31.38 --> 00:37:37.58
Who is goes down to the door and he doesn't have the combo right you go see goes hey, hey, what's the combo to the space?

501
00:37:37.58 --> 00:37:38.58
I'm like

502
00:37:38.58 --> 00:37:44.18
I gave him some wise ask you do you not know him? No, it didn't know him yet, right? How that worked out?

503
00:37:44.18 --> 00:37:47.70
It was hilarious like he he goes hey, what's the combo to the space?

504
00:37:47.70 --> 00:37:51.74
I'm like hey, man, I can't give that to you and I didn't know he was the LPO

505
00:37:52.26 --> 00:37:57.92
He's he's he's he's he's he's on the goddamn LPO. What's the fucking combo to the platoon space like

506
00:37:57.92 --> 00:38:02.78
Roger that he's pretty well three one together been two you know and I proceeded to walk down the steps

507
00:38:02.78 --> 00:38:03.78
I'm like oh

508
00:38:03.78 --> 00:38:05.78
God almighty. Why?

509
00:38:05.78 --> 00:38:09.80
And the team just I just met the LPO and it was not on good terms

510
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:13.70
Man, that's all and then he and I turned out to be good friends, but

511
00:38:14.86 --> 00:38:19.12
I remember we're out doing land warfare training and this is like where you know you're cutting the metal like you said

512
00:38:19.12 --> 00:38:22.06
You're getting to know each other and you know the guys in the platoon

513
00:38:22.06 --> 00:38:25.70
Also trying to figure out what these new guys like all right, what have I what have we got here?

514
00:38:25.70 --> 00:38:27.70
What can we rely on you know and

515
00:38:28.26 --> 00:38:29.94
so

516
00:38:29.94 --> 00:38:33.58
One night ever remember us doing a little bit of boxing and it was

517
00:38:33.58 --> 00:38:36.86
forced boxing new guy on new guy

518
00:38:37.58 --> 00:38:39.58
You know and

519
00:38:39.58 --> 00:38:44.50
Survival of the fittest oh man. Yeah, dude. And then and then at times it was just

520
00:38:45.22 --> 00:38:47.38
three on you know

521
00:38:47.38 --> 00:38:53.62
Every man for himself and it's just like your heads on a swivel and it's Mikey the tick and me and we're just

522
00:38:53.90 --> 00:38:56.70
Wailing away and it's just going and it's hey

523
00:38:57.10 --> 00:39:02.98
Who's gonna continue to fight basically right and you'd oh everything you know I'm an officer in these two guys

524
00:39:02.98 --> 00:39:05.10
Or just you know obviously well in a way, but I'm like hey man

525
00:39:05.10 --> 00:39:11.28
I'm gonna just fight to the bitter end and it was it was pretty awesome. Hey did you do your jits who before you got

526
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:13.68
I do had just enough

527
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:20.70
I didn't to make it that you could hold your own. I would when I would do the officer cumin this. Yes

528
00:39:20.70 --> 00:39:23.70
I did do some and you know to keep in mind like

529
00:39:23.70 --> 00:39:31.82
Did you train on the East Coast when I was in high school and I got in I got into greasy jutsu like literally like I was already training

530
00:39:31.82 --> 00:39:39.94
When the first UFC ever me him out right and so it was pretty cool and then that was always a big shocker for people

531
00:39:40.14 --> 00:39:43.78
Because you were you were by far smaller than the other

532
00:39:44.18 --> 00:39:49.22
Platoon officers and yet you had that you jits who had the jutsu and when you have the jutsu

533
00:39:49.22 --> 00:39:52.86
You didn't have a lot either. What were you even up to the belt? I don't even know

534
00:39:52.86 --> 00:39:55.78
Yeah, you were probably like a high level white belt

535
00:39:55.90 --> 00:40:01.26
But but to be fair like at the time it was all very new like the world of MMA today is oh

536
00:40:01.26 --> 00:40:05.90
Yeah, totally different totally different as you know, but at the time like I mean

537
00:40:05.90 --> 00:40:10.02
I even went to in high school with my with my instructor who is it who's a teacher at my school

538
00:40:10.02 --> 00:40:13.72
He was into it. So he and I would train like five in the morning before school

539
00:40:13.72 --> 00:40:19.66
Me versus him much larger man, but we learned it just and then we went and did seminars with hoist gracing

540
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:25.46
In upstate New York we would drive and it was cool. I got to get out of school. I'm going right again

541
00:40:25.46 --> 00:40:27.10
This is just proof

542
00:40:27.10 --> 00:40:32.58
That you jutsu so good because he would I would make these these officers like we meet at five o'clock in the morning

543
00:40:32.58 --> 00:40:37.46
And I say okay, and I would train with everybody, but then I say okay now you to you to fight to the death

544
00:40:38.90 --> 00:40:42.72
And then we just get after but he but he was he was 150 pounds

545
00:40:42.72 --> 00:40:47.42
He's going against guys that are 200 pounds. You know they have him by 50 pounds and taller

546
00:40:47.42 --> 00:40:49.90
And taller and and you would just you know there's

547
00:40:50.50 --> 00:40:53.74
You know it just doesn't work. You know you got to know that you did too

548
00:40:53.74 --> 00:40:59.46
Yeah, and I'm not gonna say that I wait in these are tough guys. No, no, no, that's right. That's right

549
00:40:59.46 --> 00:41:02.22
Like they weren't tapping me out. You know, didn't you usually tap them?

550
00:41:02.54 --> 00:41:06.58
I used to choke down a certain guy who didn't like that very much

551
00:41:07.74 --> 00:41:09.74
It's all right

552
00:41:09.74 --> 00:41:15.30
Yeah, but you know and the thing at that time because they're bigger than me was more about energy conservation

553
00:41:15.30 --> 00:41:19.42
Right and so like I mean I just let him wear themselves out and then they try and get things on me

554
00:41:19.42 --> 00:41:21.42
And then I just snake my way around there. But he

555
00:41:21.42 --> 00:41:24.90
Also remember you've all been tearing for the taste

556
00:41:24.90 --> 00:41:26.90
Oh

557
00:41:26.90 --> 00:41:32.78
So you actually had an attitude like you had you look like I can hit my handle this like no factor

558
00:41:32.78 --> 00:41:36.76
What you want to taste me bring it that's right. You know you don't see the guys on cops

559
00:41:37.26 --> 00:41:44.10
When there's a big tough crazy guy all on PCP and he gets tasty rips the taste around and throws the thing and he just keeps coming

560
00:41:44.10 --> 00:41:46.10
That's what Andrew Paul had that look

561
00:41:46.54 --> 00:41:48.54
Like I'm gonna

562
00:41:48.54 --> 00:41:53.58
Just go you gonna taste me bring it. Let's go. I mean hey. I'm a new guy in the pool to and right

563
00:41:53.58 --> 00:41:59.34
I mean I got to earn my spot right and so some somewhere somebody had actually was the LPO

564
00:41:59.34 --> 00:42:04.90
He had he had one of these things. Yeah, and I was like oh and I'm gonna tell you what like it had these like two modes

565
00:42:04.90 --> 00:42:07.46
And one where you could shoot or you could like put it right up to the guy

566
00:42:07.46 --> 00:42:13.36
You know and I was like hey, let's go shoot him. He's like we got my like come on. Let's go and then like the whole pool tune

567
00:42:13.36 --> 00:42:15.92
Like everybody like met down in the back cave and

568
00:42:15.92 --> 00:42:18.48
There may be a video floating around somewhere

569
00:42:19.28 --> 00:42:24.30
This one had the winter barbs that those against no-to-teaser as I like the bar like the winter bars

570
00:42:24.30 --> 00:42:27.30
Our longer to get through this weather

571
00:42:27.30 --> 00:42:34.66
Who that down coat yeah, and so when of course he was like what were you in a t-shirt or just no shirt?

572
00:42:34.66 --> 00:42:39.80
I was in a t-shirt. Yeah, and I was like oh, how those winter barbs work out for you?

573
00:42:39.80 --> 00:42:45.92
So it's like there's like all they're getting ready to do it. Oh wait wait, and you know these are my guys looking out for me

574
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:49.64
I appreciate it guys. They're like oh, we're here. Here put this eye pro one. Oh, that's a good idea

575
00:42:50.20 --> 00:42:54.44
Right, so put some eye pro on and then like like it's got a laser on it, right?

576
00:42:54.44 --> 00:43:00.04
So the laser him and you if you see the video like like you hear guys going like guys are witnessing like nobody's been

577
00:43:00.04 --> 00:43:02.50
T-he's like nobody else was gonna happen right now, right boom

578
00:43:02.50 --> 00:43:08.56
So this thing comes out at like 45 degree angle in one like goes into my sternum and the other one

579
00:43:08.56 --> 00:43:19.26
Goes below my belly button. All right, so my instantly over all that all that thinking he was just gonna just rip those things out

580
00:43:19.26 --> 00:43:27.64
He went ridge and thank God we put a mat down. Yes, there was a man because he went ridge straight and fell like a brick

581
00:43:27.64 --> 00:43:28.92
Yeah, boom

582
00:43:28.92 --> 00:43:35.36
Nothing and then just so it so clearly and I remember this too like it hits you and like it hits you in that in that spot

583
00:43:35.36 --> 00:43:40.78
And like your hands go to grab like you've been stung you've been hit so your hands my hands get like three quarters of the way there

584
00:43:40.90 --> 00:43:43.44
By the time the electricity freezes the body

585
00:43:43.44 --> 00:43:48.46
So my hands are kind of like stuck in front of my chest in my admin as it attempted to grab this spot

586
00:43:48.74 --> 00:43:50.24
So I go over and

587
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:55.96
All right, they turn the thing off and then they go to get these things out somebody's got a pair of pliers and in the barbed

588
00:43:55.96 --> 00:44:04.28
I remember that you know it's good when you need pliers that much to dislodge the show like it went into the muscle like because like I remember

589
00:44:04.28 --> 00:44:10.48
ripping and coming free but not free and it was but it was still beneath the skin and

590
00:44:11.20 --> 00:44:13.20
And then it just like just rip it

591
00:44:13.76 --> 00:44:18.76
This is the team's bad. This is what makes the team so far. Yeah, one day you show up at work

592
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:25.22
You're just volunteer to get taste and you're gonna get some the best thing you can do is just volunteer in a situation like that

593
00:44:25.22 --> 00:44:30.48
Yeah, you know and just like I come on. Let's go. Yeah, brilliant and then they got oh, okay, right on, you know

594
00:44:30.48 --> 00:44:36.000
Yeah, well, you did the right thing. I'm sorry. I didn't work out through work. I think work down great

595
00:44:37.76 --> 00:44:40.000
All right, so we get word

596
00:44:41.16 --> 00:44:44.000
We get done with our work up and now it's time to go on deployment and

597
00:44:45.84 --> 00:44:48.32
Get on deployment and we found out

598
00:44:49.12 --> 00:44:55.06
What two weeks before you guys were on leave when we found out we were going to Ramadi instead of where we originally supposed to go

599
00:44:55.06 --> 00:44:58.68
Which was and I rack but we knew I mean I knew Ramadi was gonna be the

600
00:44:58.68 --> 00:45:00.68
The the best place to deploy to and

601
00:45:03.66 --> 00:45:06.36
We show up over there and what was cool. I thought about

602
00:45:07.16 --> 00:45:15.44
With with that deployment is the way we task organized and every basically every leader got their own element

603
00:45:15.44 --> 00:45:20.08
Yeah, yeah, and put you guys it was like, oh, yeah, you know how you've been working for this and we've been all but no

604
00:45:20.08 --> 00:45:24.88
You're going out on your own your your in charge. Yeah, and that was that was awesome and that

605
00:45:24.88 --> 00:45:30.46
What made me feel good was that when we were in the work up and we made you guys run operations even though

606
00:45:30.46 --> 00:45:36.24
You were new guys and made you put you in pressure situations and put you in charge of ground force commander while you were

607
00:45:36.80 --> 00:45:42.34
You know most troops didn't do that right but I knew that there was a possibility and furthermore

608
00:45:42.64 --> 00:45:47.44
What happens if you know your platoon commander gets killed what happens if I get killed and then you're the guy

609
00:45:47.44 --> 00:45:52.76
Yeah, then you got to be able to step up and run stuff and so we did that through the chain of command and and we did

610
00:45:52.76 --> 00:45:57.40
I will admit to this we made sure that we had crushed the work up

611
00:45:58.28 --> 00:46:02.96
And then it was like okay, we've dominated okay now we start training the new guys up on how to lead and that was

612
00:46:02.96 --> 00:46:07.04
Yeah, that was important too because it's you want to do well in the workup

613
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:12.14
You want you because that's where your reputation as a task when it comes from is how well you do going through these various training

614
00:46:12.14 --> 00:46:17.84
Well, that's why we earned earned the spot to be able to go to Iraq right because the thing is is that some guys are going elsewhere

615
00:46:17.84 --> 00:46:24.64
And you're all vying look I mean you're all vying because you want to go to combat and some guys are going someplace else not in Iraq and

616
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.16
You know, I hate to say it, but that's not where any of us really wanted to go

617
00:46:29.16 --> 00:46:32.76
Oh nothing to say about that if you're in the seal teams you want to go to war

618
00:46:32.76 --> 00:46:37.20
That's right we all wanted to go to war. That's what we were fighting for we were competing

619
00:46:37.20 --> 00:46:42.000
There's three task units we were competing as a task unit to get top spot to the most dangerous place

620
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.44
And that's what we want to go and that's right out to be a body now by the way

621
00:46:45.44 --> 00:46:50.72
On that workout to just from a leadership perspective. I don't know if you remember you know not everybody made it through the workout

622
00:46:51.44 --> 00:46:53.44
There were guys who were cut loose

623
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.24
Safety issues not stepping up not leading right pushing that leadership opportunity down to the junior officer whatever and not stepping up

624
00:47:00.24 --> 00:47:03.76
We're doing something unsafe or just not having what it took and

625
00:47:04.88 --> 00:47:06.08
You know and

626
00:47:06.08 --> 00:47:08.16
You know just from a leadership perspective you have to be

627
00:47:08.88 --> 00:47:11.12
willing to make that hard decision and

628
00:47:11.12 --> 00:47:17.36
Reality and I know you know you only have talked about it when you've given everybody that guy every opportunity when you've evaluated it

629
00:47:17.36 --> 00:47:20.24
And you've kept notes and you've tried to train and you've tried to correct

630
00:47:20.88 --> 00:47:22.88
It's not a hard decision right

631
00:47:23.28 --> 00:47:28.72
Yeah, actually the common or I don't know if you were there but the common or asked me we were on deployment

632
00:47:28.72 --> 00:47:32.06
And he goes you know hey, hey, chocolate. This is in front of everyone. He says you know

633
00:47:32.40 --> 00:47:34.32
Well, I shouldn't say everyone's in front of a leadership

634
00:47:34.32 --> 00:47:39.68
He says hey how are the guys that weren't in work up maybe weren't performing up to par how are they doing over here?

635
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:46.40
And I was like sir, they're not in this task. They're not here. That's right. Yeah, they did make it. Yeah, right? They've been removed. That's right

636
00:47:46.64 --> 00:47:49.44
So yeah, that's a great point and again

637
00:47:49.60 --> 00:47:52.16
It's hard thing to do because you because you really

638
00:47:53.04 --> 00:47:59.36
You're really wrecking someone's life. Well think about it, right? So this is a guy who is who so there's a guy who's an officer

639
00:47:59.92 --> 00:48:02.52
Right, so I mean we didn't really kind of glaze through it

640
00:48:02.52 --> 00:48:05.84
But it's hard to get a spot to go to buddha's an officer. Yeah, it's very competitive

641
00:48:05.84 --> 00:48:11.44
So this is a guy who's an officer who got a spot to go to buddha's made it through buds which is hard

642
00:48:13.12 --> 00:48:19.92
Made it through SKT got to a pulltune this this guy is not a slouch physically. You know what I mean like this is not this is not

643
00:48:20.64 --> 00:48:27.52
some loser, you know, this is a guy who made great American right patriotic. That's right. That's right. That's right. Great guy

644
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.84
Who stepped up who made it through something that many many other men could not make it through and

645
00:48:33.84 --> 00:48:35.84
And had to make a hard decision

646
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:45.52
You know on your part with the Delta Patoon commander to not have this guy continue with us and so if that can happen even within the seal teams

647
00:48:45.52 --> 00:48:47.44
So it goes because they were listening right? I mean

648
00:48:47.76 --> 00:48:52.16
Don't you think that's also possible that within your organization you might have to make a similar kind of decision

649
00:48:53.04 --> 00:48:58.08
We also have to make that decision in the seal teams. We're not exempt from making that decision

650
00:48:58.24 --> 00:49:00.88
Yeah, and also very much like the civilian sector

651
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:02.88
You know

652
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:07.44
There's HR basically in the military there's HR. There's there's human resource department

653
00:49:07.44 --> 00:49:10.64
You can't just walk into animal like this guy on the fire. That's right. No, okay. Well

654
00:49:11.04 --> 00:49:13.92
What have you counseled them has you paper work on him?

655
00:49:13.92 --> 00:49:17.36
That does he know that? Dave you verbally have you written it? It's all these things. That's right

656
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:21.28
He went through that whole procedure. Yeah, and you know if there's an extreme case of course

657
00:49:21.28 --> 00:49:26.56
You can you can make it happen, but it's gonna cost you a little bit of political capital because honestly if I'm your boss

658
00:49:26.56 --> 00:49:29.52
And you come to me and say hey, I want to fire this guy and I say okay. Why?

659
00:49:29.52 --> 00:49:35.36
Well, I don't I don't you know he's not doing his job anymore and I say okay did you counsel? No, not yet, but I want to fire him anyways

660
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:39.12
That's gonna cost you some political capital. Yeah, I'm actually looking you're going away second

661
00:49:39.12 --> 00:49:42.88
Why didn't you train this guy? Yeah, you as a leader. Why didn't you step up and train this guy? What what are you doing?

662
00:49:42.88 --> 00:49:46.96
Because it cuz that can be a cop out right hey if I'm too lazy to train mentor

663
00:49:47.36 --> 00:49:52.64
Then you're copying you out as leader, but if you've done all those things as a leader and you can really document that and see that and they guys

664
00:49:52.64 --> 00:49:56.16
Still not performing then the next leadership decision is toned-up

665
00:49:56.16 --> 00:50:02.64
Partway and that really is I mean that really is one of the the best things about the seal teams is is when you're raising your guys up

666
00:50:02.64 --> 00:50:07.84
When you're when you're teaching guys what you know and you're saying hey, man, this what you need to do hey

667
00:50:08.40 --> 00:50:11.76
Bro, here's what here's the way this works here's what you did over here. Here's what you should do

668
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:14.80
You know that's just that's your that's your legacy

669
00:50:14.80 --> 00:50:19.68
That's what you leave behind is is hey this is what I learned and I want to teach you to as many guys as I can

670
00:50:19.68 --> 00:50:22.72
That's what you're trying to do so if you're alive you're not doing that

671
00:50:22.72 --> 00:50:29.84
That's jacked up, you know, that's jacked up and it's the same thing in the civilian sector. You know here's a good one

672
00:50:30.72 --> 00:50:36.16
I was working on we work with companies and I was working on the company the other day and they got a guy who sort of

673
00:50:37.36 --> 00:50:39.36
You know, oh well well

674
00:50:39.52 --> 00:50:46.40
Maybe he's not the best mentor right but he wants to get promoted of course because everyone wants to

675
00:50:46.96 --> 00:50:51.84
So this guy wants to get promoted and they're trying to they haven't had luck saying look you got to be a mentor

676
00:50:51.84 --> 00:50:58.000
You got to lead you got to be a better leader. You got to braze people up and I just you know talk talk to the boss

677
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.28
And I said well ask him this question. Yeah, you know what I definitely am looking forward to promoting you

678
00:51:03.28 --> 00:51:06.72
Give me the three names of people that you've prepared to take your position right

679
00:51:07.92 --> 00:51:13.28
Goose eggs right. It's gonna be goose eggs cuz yeah, isn't done that that's right so that's a key component

680
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:15.28
You know you definitely want to

681
00:51:15.52 --> 00:51:21.04
You want to be as a leader you should be looking for your replacement all the time and I with with with with lathe

682
00:51:21.04 --> 00:51:26.64
With a delta to a commander. I want to those guys build do my job and that's my whole goal and I wanted you to be able to do my job right

683
00:51:26.64 --> 00:51:30.16
And I'll tell you by the time we went on to play me. They everyone pretty much could do my job

684
00:51:31.04 --> 00:51:35.36
So that that was success for me because guess what that allowed me to do on to play me

685
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:39.84
Look at the look up and look out and figure out what we're gonna do next and all that other stuff

686
00:51:40.16 --> 00:51:43.84
So that should be your goal from a leadership perspective for sure and

687
00:51:44.16 --> 00:51:48.72
As you just pointed out when you get to a situation where you've done the coaching you've done the mentoring

688
00:51:48.72 --> 00:51:53.44
You've done the counseling you've written you've set the expectation you have a person that's still isn't caught in the monster

689
00:51:53.76 --> 00:51:56.72
You gotta go not a hard decision and you have to be loyal

690
00:51:57.20 --> 00:51:59.44
People get mixed up too because there's a loyalty component

691
00:51:59.44 --> 00:52:03.84
Hey, cuz you formed those relationships. We just talked about an hour about this big relationship with all these people

692
00:52:03.84 --> 00:52:06.80
Well guess what you ever relationship with that person that you're about to fire too

693
00:52:07.36 --> 00:52:09.36
But then the question becomes

694
00:52:09.36 --> 00:52:13.28
Are you gonna be loyal to that individual you may loyal to the team because you're hurting the side

695
00:52:13.28 --> 00:52:15.28
Yeah, that's exactly right. It's the team. Yep

696
00:52:15.28 --> 00:52:18.96
So that's that we went on to plan with a strong bunch of

697
00:52:19.68 --> 00:52:21.68
Pipeters all right

698
00:52:22.64 --> 00:52:28.72
So we get on to plan and we you you guys we kind of and this is again this is something Tony and I talk about we were

699
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:34.24
Task organized and we changed that we changed it on a fairly regular base. Okay. We know what we this area is getting hot

700
00:52:34.24 --> 00:52:39.28
Need more guys over there and we would just kind of there's a lot to do there's a lot to do there's a lot of work to be done

701
00:52:39.28 --> 00:52:41.28
There was a lot a lot of bad guys

702
00:52:41.28 --> 00:52:43.28
Um

703
00:52:43.68 --> 00:52:50.80
When you when you look back and you're kind of so now you're on your first combat deployment what was the thing that struck you as?

704
00:52:52.40 --> 00:52:57.44
Damn like okay, this is what cuz I'll tell you people asked me that and I'm like the first firefight

705
00:52:57.44 --> 00:53:01.76
I got in while my first deployment to Iraq and honestly I was like okay

706
00:53:01.76 --> 00:53:07.12
I felt like I was 100% prepared. I agree completely and I was like okay cool. Hey guys

707
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:13.12
You know, he's just very simple very straightforward. So some guys said to me one time and this is an outside guy and

708
00:53:13.76 --> 00:53:16.16
Said because it kind of seems to me that in the tiltings he guys do

709
00:53:16.88 --> 00:53:23.52
Stress in evacuation really well and so I would say yes because that's that was exactly my same first firefight

710
00:53:23.52 --> 00:53:25.52
I got in I was like

711
00:53:25.52 --> 00:53:30.40
No, but deal and you know look you know when the rounds are close right like you know what that sounds like and

712
00:53:30.80 --> 00:53:34.000
They're and they're really close and it's no big deal by the way

713
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.84
It's not really very loud when they're shooting at you right I mean you hear certain sounds

714
00:53:38.88 --> 00:53:44.48
But then of course he's fire maneuvering. It's a little bit loud, but that's awesome. It's just like every drill we've ever done and it was no big deal

715
00:53:44.48 --> 00:53:46.08
It was just

716
00:53:46.08 --> 00:53:53.88
It was almost habit at that point you can you exactly the number so no big deal the first the first time I went out in a humbany

717
00:53:54.72 --> 00:53:58.40
In Ramadi so keep in mind like you said on the introduction we got there

718
00:53:58.40 --> 00:54:06.80
Guys were getting IED and killed every single day every day the message traffic came over and it was

719
00:54:07.20 --> 00:54:09.20
KIA you know

720
00:54:09.20 --> 00:54:10.20
IED

721
00:54:10.20 --> 00:54:11.20
So

722
00:54:11.20 --> 00:54:12.80
first home the

723
00:54:12.80 --> 00:54:18.000
Rada go out in and I'm looking out the window and by the way like you can't really roll these windows down

724
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.12
It's not like you can you don't want to roll these windows down by the way

725
00:54:21.12 --> 00:54:24.48
All the proof windows right you want to keep them up right and you know

726
00:54:24.48 --> 00:54:30.64
So like you actually can't shoot back if you want to right the only guy who can shoot back is your turret gunner and

727
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:35.28
For the first like I would just say minute and a half I was like

728
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.44
Wencing I was like waiting for this clock to go

729
00:54:40.16 --> 00:54:42.80
You know and then finally I was like you know what

730
00:54:43.28 --> 00:54:50.64
There's nothing I can do about it and I literally let it go right then so that was like that's a strong memory like I remember

731
00:54:50.64 --> 00:54:54.64
Even for all the training and again the first firefight was no big deal and

732
00:54:55.36 --> 00:54:59.60
But driving down in a home the sitting in the back completely helpless

733
00:54:59.60 --> 00:55:04.52
I mean you have two choices and life is a lot like this you can sit there and worry yourself away about it

734
00:55:04.52 --> 00:55:09.12
Whoa is it this intersection is it this intersector or just go you know what here's a deal

735
00:55:09.12 --> 00:55:12.84
I can't control it so I'm just gonna be ready so it went my time to bust out this door or do whatever

736
00:55:12.84 --> 00:55:14.72
We got to do it to do the media action drill or whatever

737
00:55:14.96 --> 00:55:20.24
I'm ready to do it and the rest of it you just let go you let go because anything else is not effective

738
00:55:20.24 --> 00:55:24.32
Yeah, you're not you're not yet it's not only just are you worried

739
00:55:24.32 --> 00:55:26.32
But now you're you're actually doing things bad

740
00:55:26.32 --> 00:55:31.52
You're actually being negative you're thinking about things that you shouldn't be thinking about and it's not helping you

741
00:55:31.52 --> 00:55:35.84
It's not helping your team so I like that just to just to kind of sum up what you said

742
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:40.000
You were in Ramadi for six months. You were scared for about a minute and 30 seconds

743
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Yeah, and after that I

744
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.20
And I think that's the attitude that I

745
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:50.24
Think that's the best I hate I don't know if this is the right thing to say or not but

746
00:55:50.88 --> 00:55:55.20
To accept the fact there's things you can't control that you cannot control and

747
00:55:55.68 --> 00:55:59.12
That one of those things is you know an ID a sniper bullet

748
00:55:59.12 --> 00:56:04.24
Yeah, I mean, and now there's things that you can do to influence because guess what we do training

749
00:56:04.24 --> 00:56:06.40
We prepare we're keeping our eyes peeled

750
00:56:06.40 --> 00:56:09.84
We're taking routes that we know have been cleared to the best of our ability

751
00:56:09.84 --> 00:56:12.64
We're we're we're on the street we're moving we're moving to cover cover

752
00:56:12.64 --> 00:56:15.52
We're doing everything that we can but guess what it doesn't matter

753
00:56:15.52 --> 00:56:19.36
You can do everything right and doesn't matter. You can still get blown up. You can still get shot

754
00:56:19.60 --> 00:56:23.92
That's the way it is so if you sit around and just think about that all the time

755
00:56:24.24 --> 00:56:28.88
It's just gonna drive you crazy one and number two is gonna make you do your job worse

756
00:56:29.04 --> 00:56:31.52
Yeah, because you're gonna be less aggressive and I think

757
00:56:33.20 --> 00:56:37.44
You gotta stay aggressive to stay alive you you want to be aggressive you want to be you know what yeah

758
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:39.04
We'll go to make that happen. Oh

759
00:56:39.04 --> 00:56:42.80
They're they're I do I want to sit in the vehicle right now or get out and get out and get some ground

760
00:56:42.80 --> 00:56:46.80
I mean that's just the type of thing that's mindset. It's a mindset that that wins

761
00:56:46.80 --> 00:56:51.76
That's it. It's the winning mindset and if your goals to win then you have to recognize

762
00:56:51.76 --> 00:56:56.56
That certain thought processes are not effective and they take away from your ability to win

763
00:56:56.56 --> 00:56:59.52
And you know I see people get worried about stuff that kind of thing, right? So

764
00:57:00.24 --> 00:57:04.56
You just you take us to value I want to win right the guy said me one time hey

765
00:57:04.56 --> 00:57:08.64
Do you think do you think fear is a is a useful

766
00:57:09.76 --> 00:57:15.28
Emotion I thought about for a second. I've never lots of different people talk about fear and you know this and that and you know

767
00:57:15.28 --> 00:57:17.28
I would say for

768
00:57:17.44 --> 00:57:21.04
Maybe I'll change this one day, but right now. This is where I've come to on fear

769
00:57:21.84 --> 00:57:28.08
Maybe for the caveman who's walking through the jungle and they get attacked by the Sabre two tiger and that fear that

770
00:57:28.08 --> 00:57:35.28
Fidr flight response is enough to make him react in a moment in order to avoid being slashed by the tiger

771
00:57:35.68 --> 00:57:42.72
But other than that fear was not effective in battle because you do not make good decisions when acting in fear

772
00:57:43.12 --> 00:57:50.40
And you have a better chance of survival you make better decisions and you have a better chance of winning and defeating and crushing the enemy when you were main calm

773
00:57:50.80 --> 00:57:52.80
You do do do do do do do right?

774
00:57:52.80 --> 00:57:59.60
Observe oriented side act. Yeah, yeah, I get asked to I obviously get asked about fear a lot and you know

775
00:57:59.60 --> 00:58:00.96
I would say look

776
00:58:00.96 --> 00:58:05.36
Fear is that there's not a bad thing because it's the thing that makes you go. Okay. I need to be ready

777
00:58:05.68 --> 00:58:09.36
Right is the thing that makes you worse. It's the thing that makes you say okay because you and for me

778
00:58:10.64 --> 00:58:16.72
The again the fear wasn't about the fear of get killed getting blown up the fear was always about

779
00:58:16.72 --> 00:58:22.32
I want to I don't want to do a bad job. I don't want to make a bad decision that I'll tell you your leadership position

780
00:58:22.80 --> 00:58:29.04
That is the heaviest fear that you have is I make a mistake my team does something that doesn't

781
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:31.76
doesn't

782
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:38.88
Bring credit upon us as a union by that. I mean doesn't do a good job like you're just I don't even know where that comes from

783
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:42.16
It's just want to do a good job and the fear is hey

784
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:47.76
I hope I don't do anything that gets my guys hurt or killed. I hope doing anything that's a bad decision that makes that does that hurts

785
00:58:47.76 --> 00:58:50.64
us strategically as a nation. Yeah, those are the two

786
00:58:51.20 --> 00:58:57.12
fears that I think make your hurts make you practice make you reinforce make you

787
00:58:58.48 --> 00:59:01.68
Aware of what's happening, but you can't what you can't do

788
00:59:02.32 --> 00:59:08.88
I mean for me fear fear is makes me aggressive like oh I think this guy's gonna gonna do something to me cool

789
00:59:08.88 --> 00:59:12.96
I'm afraid of him call me to attack him. I'm gonna kill him. You know I'm gonna take him out. I'm gonna do something

790
00:59:13.20 --> 00:59:16.08
You know and I actually see that time and you know I see that name in me too

791
00:59:16.48 --> 00:59:21.68
Where when you see someone happen to somebody where they get a little bit they get a little bit rocked or something

792
00:59:23.04 --> 00:59:29.28
If they if they let that fear make them back off and go into a defensive mode it's exactly what you just said

793
00:59:29.28 --> 00:59:34.96
If it makes you into a defensive mode, it's good you're gonna the person's gonna because man you can smell that that's right

794
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:39.28
You can smell that so when I think the reaction to fear is like oh I'm afraid right now

795
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:43.20
COVID attack I have to attack yeah like oh I don't feel comfortable about where the

796
00:59:43.44 --> 00:59:46.000
Troop is moving right now or where my squad is moving right now

797
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.84
I don't think it's a good thing cool. I'm gonna attack him to take some high ground. I'm gonna maneuver that's

798
00:59:50.32 --> 00:59:56.08
What's healthy yes, it's healthy fear that that's healthy, but you're also trained and prepared mentally for that kind of thing

799
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:01.12
Most people when they start acting in fear they start making poor decisions. Yeah, yeah, so so in that sense

800
01:00:01.12 --> 01:00:05.04
It's like hey get over your fears because you have to recognize when you're acting in fear

801
01:00:05.12 --> 01:00:10.64
You'll have a less desirable outcome than if you can get over it calm down sip you know observable or into sidacto

802
01:00:10.64 --> 01:00:12.64
No doubt about it

803
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:17.76
All right, what about what about just plain leadership challenges? I mean here we are just a stressful deployment

804
01:00:17.76 --> 01:00:19.76
Yep, it was

805
01:00:19.76 --> 01:00:24.000
It was the most stressful deployment that anybody had had up until that point in Iraq

806
01:00:26.40 --> 01:00:30.80
And even talking to you know the Vietnam guys this was a stressful deployment

807
01:00:30.80 --> 01:00:38.16
Yeah, a very stressful deployment in the amount of combat that was happening. Well urban combat happen it's happening so fast

808
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.20
So but from a leadership perspective what did you was there anything that you didn't expect was there any lesson that got confirmed?

809
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:53.04
Yeah, so in its funny because you know over time in the deployment

810
01:00:54.16 --> 01:00:56.16
You really mature

811
01:00:56.16 --> 01:01:03.20
Even in a short amount of time and I'll give you a quick quick story so it was one of my last ops before I left country

812
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:08.64
And there was another unit that had come into kind of partner up with us and

813
01:01:09.68 --> 01:01:13.60
We went into this op and so the officer in that you know who's a good friend of mine by the way

814
01:01:14.88 --> 01:01:20.32
Was it might have been his second combat op, right? And so I've been on I don't even know how many at that point

815
01:01:20.32 --> 01:01:28.88
And so we went into this operation and it involves some army units and so we're sitting in this position and

816
01:01:30.16 --> 01:01:32.16
So

817
01:01:32.40 --> 01:01:39.68
Like classic blunder the army guy who's sitting there is on the rooftop and he's smoking a cigarette

818
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:46.64
Like like the classic world war to sniper victim smoke in a cigarette

819
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:49.36
Trail smoke going up

820
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:53.12
And I mean this is classic I mean single sniper shot

821
01:01:54.56 --> 01:01:59.04
Shoot them and it it just I mean it misses his face

822
01:01:59.84 --> 01:02:01.92
Well, I'm gonna put this way it took his ear a little off

823
01:02:02.48 --> 01:02:09.76
Right around cracks into the wall behind us. That's it immediately everybody just by like just unloads firefight

824
01:02:09.76 --> 01:02:11.12
Right and

825
01:02:11.12 --> 01:02:15.20
So we're calling it met it after this guy because it kind of it still cut him pretty good and

826
01:02:15.20 --> 01:02:17.20
And

827
01:02:17.20 --> 01:02:21.44
Trying to figure out through the meeting more fire whatever the situation is so so this guy is like well

828
01:02:22.24 --> 01:02:24.24
on my case so

829
01:02:24.32 --> 01:02:28.64
Time to call it you are often get out here. It's like well, you know, I think I'm like feet think what dude

830
01:02:29.36 --> 01:02:34.64
What else do you think is possibly gonna come from this and you know? I mean I probably

831
01:02:35.52 --> 01:02:38.80
Would have thought hey, maybe we could still get something from this it was my first or second

832
01:02:38.80 --> 01:02:40.88
Right, but it was just clear like I mean at this point

833
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:44.000
I mean we've already we've already got a lot of guys hurt on this deployment

834
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We've already lost Mark and

835
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:49.92
If you have a guy, so you know, they'll just already been shot at this point so

836
01:02:52.80 --> 01:02:59.92
You have to weigh like what what more are you gonna gain? I mean first of all this guy just this sniper just got a bead on this guy

837
01:02:59.92 --> 01:03:03.44
I mean in by the grace of God he is still alive and

838
01:03:04.24 --> 01:03:06.24
We've shot like so

839
01:03:06.48 --> 01:03:10.96
What else is gonna happen? I mean they're either just gonna set up and get a better position or get another shot

840
01:03:10.96 --> 01:03:17.04
But they certainly aren't gonna do anything we certainly aren't gonna see anything that they don't want us to see at this point

841
01:03:17.04 --> 01:03:22.000
So the battlefield is lost. I mean this op is it's over. It's it's time to pull shocks and go

842
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:25.92
So anyway that already came and busted down this wall with the fighting go who's awesome?

843
01:03:25.92 --> 01:03:27.92
I mean I love the fighting Bradley fighting you whole

844
01:03:28.48 --> 01:03:32.32
But you know that should sort of like a quick it's like obvious it's obvious to me at that point

845
01:03:32.32 --> 01:03:36.72
And I don't mind anymore in comp you know quarterback 10 years later as I'm explaining this like

846
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:41.44
Anyways, we'll see you can go well. Yeah, obviously time to go right, but you know what you're in that position and guys

847
01:03:41.44 --> 01:03:44.000
They're still trying to get after it and there's still things going on out there

848
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You might think well, maybe there's still something we can do here

849
01:03:47.20 --> 01:03:49.20
Yeah, and by the way, but

850
01:03:49.20 --> 01:03:56.32
There was other times where similar situations happen in different decisions were made and they worked out great. Yep, you know and so

851
01:03:57.84 --> 01:03:59.84
I think you're overall

852
01:03:59.84 --> 01:04:06.16
Statement is like you gained perspective right over time and you're able to look at things from a

853
01:04:06.72 --> 01:04:11.20
From a better perspective and from a higher altitude from a lack of a better way to say

854
01:04:11.20 --> 01:04:14.96
You'll understand what's happening on the battlefield more. You know that's definitely

855
01:04:15.76 --> 01:04:19.44
Something that if people are listening and it's something that they want to become aware

856
01:04:19.44 --> 01:04:21.28
It's it's something that you can actually act on

857
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.04
because

858
01:04:23.04 --> 01:04:25.04
that perspective

859
01:04:25.04 --> 01:04:28.16
It can be gained through time and experience

860
01:04:28.16 --> 01:04:30.16
But it can also be gained by

861
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:35.76
Detachment and saying okay, what am I really doing here right now? Yeah, what are we really going to gain?

862
01:04:36.32 --> 01:04:43.28
And you can make a faster progress down the line to have to make good judgment calls based on

863
01:04:43.76 --> 01:04:48.56
Not just experience, but just on knowledge and and trying to capture the right perspective at the right time

864
01:04:48.72 --> 01:04:50.56
plus a big tactic for those guys

865
01:04:50.56 --> 01:04:53.44
It was slowly developing and and happened

866
01:04:53.92 --> 01:04:55.28
after we left

867
01:04:55.28 --> 01:05:03.52
So is there anything else that you start that that you learned again that you didn't expect or that was useful for you

868
01:05:06.72 --> 01:05:12.80
From a leadership perspective yeah, so you know I found myself in a position a lot of times of

869
01:05:13.44 --> 01:05:18.40
Kind of stitching the people keeping it put to and stitch together, you know because in an intense situation

870
01:05:18.72 --> 01:05:21.20
I start to have different opinions about things, you know

871
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:24.000
They do indeed yeah and so

872
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So

873
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.64
On this deployment I was not the puttune commander right my good friend was the puttune commander and

874
01:05:31.36 --> 01:05:37.76
When you're in a position leadership you're making a lot of hard decisions and not everybody always agrees with the decision that gets made

875
01:05:38.32 --> 01:05:47.12
And so a lot of times the role I needed to fill was to back my puttune commander and continue to keep the puttune together behind puttune commander

876
01:05:47.12 --> 01:05:49.52
because he he had he was tasked with making some hard decisions

877
01:05:49.52 --> 01:05:51.52
So

878
01:05:52.88 --> 01:05:56.88
Sometimes it was you know some you know, so look I would just the analogy I would give to you is that

879
01:05:57.36 --> 01:06:04.000
You may be in a role in a company in an organization where the best thing you can do to be part of the team is to

880
01:06:05.04 --> 01:06:08.56
Help keep the team on focus for the mission and that might mean

881
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:13.04
You know spend some time with one or two guys who are over here

882
01:06:13.04 --> 01:06:22.000
Have it disagreeing about the decision or which way things are going and truly one of the best ways that you end up having to do that or doing that

883
01:06:22.40 --> 01:06:26.80
Is number one you build the relationships with the guys right so they know and trust you number two

884
01:06:27.68 --> 01:06:29.68
year-potune commander is

885
01:06:29.92 --> 01:06:36.40
Got a lot of stuff on his plate right and so one of the easiest things for him to

886
01:06:37.12 --> 01:06:39.12
Cut short is

887
01:06:39.12 --> 01:06:44.64
The guys of of explaining hey here's why this is going on here's how why this gonna so you as the intermedia

888
01:06:44.64 --> 01:06:46.08
You're saying okay, I know what he's doing

889
01:06:46.08 --> 01:06:48.56
I know he's making this isn't let me explain this down the chain of command

890
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:55.44
That's right and that's so helpful and so helpful and when you got guys in the puttune or any organization a high performing organization

891
01:06:55.84 --> 01:07:01.32
That are really strong-willed and have strong opinions and by the way are an intelligent and it can make really

892
01:07:01.32 --> 01:07:03.52
Articular points as to why they don't agree with something

893
01:07:04.32 --> 01:07:07.76
You know again my role in that in that situation

894
01:07:07.76 --> 01:07:14.40
Was to ensure that mission success continued to happen that we were still effective as a unit and that meant me

895
01:07:14.64 --> 01:07:22.64
Kind of behind the scenes trying to keep keep some guys on board. Yeah, and it's interesting. I'm sure people have noted this already but

896
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:26.08
When you said there's these different people inside of a puttune

897
01:07:26.08 --> 01:07:33.04
I mean just if you listen to the podcast that I just were did with retired senior chief Tony of fratty and you

898
01:07:33.04 --> 01:07:39.92
You guys personalities are are very very different very very different and that's just some of what you get in a suit

899
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:44.68
To and you know what it's not just some what getting a suit to it's some of what you get in any

900
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.28
Organization that's right there's no clones. There's not people being turned out

901
01:07:49.84 --> 01:07:52.72
They can have the same background they can go to the same school

902
01:07:52.72 --> 01:07:55.36
They can have the same level experience they can be totally different people

903
01:07:55.36 --> 01:07:58.24
That's the way it is and that's the way it isn't the seal teams and that's the way it is in every organization

904
01:07:58.24 --> 01:08:01.68
Part of why we're so good right because you get guys that think differently. You have problems differently

905
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:08.88
Yes, but I like the fact of what you're saying is you had to be you found yourself in the role of

906
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:12.72
Okay, you know what I'm going to make sure that the guys understand where the puttune commanders coming from

907
01:08:13.12 --> 01:08:16.16
Would the got that if there's something that actually makes sense?

908
01:08:16.16 --> 01:08:18.80
I'm going to bring it back to puttune commander and say look this isn't one of the guys

909
01:08:18.96 --> 01:08:22.72
You know complaining about something here's the legitimate point that's being made right

910
01:08:23.12 --> 01:08:26.96
And then you guys can have that the such discussion maybe brings in one of those guys

911
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:31.68
And we'll tell me what you're talking about here and then you guys can move forward and come up with a best possible plan

912
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:40.88
But yeah as a peacemaker for all practical purposes is is what's is where you what you end up being and

913
01:08:42.08 --> 01:08:44.48
You know before what the one other

914
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:51.12
Peas makers needed because there wasn't a lot of peace over there not a lot of peace

915
01:08:51.84 --> 01:08:53.84
And one of the stories I think that

916
01:08:53.84 --> 01:09:02.40
That little Mikey story here that kind of shows you the level of violence that was happening in Ramadi

917
01:09:03.44 --> 01:09:05.44
so I

918
01:09:05.44 --> 01:09:07.44
Came to visit

919
01:09:07.68 --> 01:09:11.92
Because I was on the other side of Ramadi and the guys from Delta

920
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:19.76
First a small section of guys from Delta and then all of them ended up on the on the eastern side of Ramadi with the first the five last six band of brothers

921
01:09:19.76 --> 01:09:23.76
Awesome outstanding unit amazing

922
01:09:24.56 --> 01:09:26.56
guys to a man and

923
01:09:27.20 --> 01:09:32.48
With an amazing commander, but so Delta tuned ended up over there well anyways

924
01:09:33.04 --> 01:09:37.44
I'd gone over to to visit go go do some ops with them and see what's going on and

925
01:09:38.08 --> 01:09:44.24
When I showed up you know, I showed up and and this was a few is probably like a month and a half in

926
01:09:44.24 --> 01:09:48.64
Uh because the guys had taken over some crappy

927
01:09:50.08 --> 01:09:52.08
Building and

928
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:55.44
Full metal jacket and had built it out FMJ

929
01:09:55.84 --> 01:10:02.64
So if you guys seen the movie full metal jacket that's a scene in the movie where these guys these buildings are all blown out well this building where

930
01:10:03.68 --> 01:10:06.40
Not not just the seals, but a bunch of guys army guys

931
01:10:06.96 --> 01:10:10.24
Lived in this building and it was all blown out and it looked like this awesome

932
01:10:10.24 --> 01:10:12.24
It was awesome

933
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:17.60
When we first got in there the first one we first went out there it was dirt it was literally dirt floors

934
01:10:17.60 --> 01:10:21.20
Just mosquitoes everywhere. It was totally it was just horrible and

935
01:10:22.16 --> 01:10:27.04
Now sometime had passed and the guys of course you put seal somewhere. They're gonna dial some stuff in

936
01:10:27.04 --> 01:10:34.32
You see the CBS that we have this CBS we are my gosh the CBS we had were phenomenal and we don't know what CBS are

937
01:10:34.32 --> 01:10:37.76
They're sort of the Navy's version of engineers and

938
01:10:37.76 --> 01:10:44.88
They're they're fanatically hard workers and the crew that we had with us in our body that was that was we they were part of our tasking

939
01:10:44.88 --> 01:10:46.88
It they were just

940
01:10:46.88 --> 01:10:53.60
Total hard chargers and bus their ass and make stuff happen. So they had and the other thing the other thing you have to do in your

941
01:10:53.60 --> 01:10:57.84
Cb is you have to learn to acquire things because there's a lack of things

942
01:10:58.40 --> 01:11:04.16
In combat zone and so you're good CB can come up with let's call it you know

943
01:11:04.16 --> 01:11:10.96
120 sheets of 4 by 8 plywood right that our master or CB master. She's awesome

944
01:11:11.28 --> 01:11:17.12
We got there do they had they had these racks built out for us in this balloon out concrete building

945
01:11:17.28 --> 01:11:18.80
That had like shells

946
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:25.76
Yeah, stairs to go to the upper and do it was awesome. Yeah, so they take they that's what they've done is taken and just built the like into these

947
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:27.76
Basically small plywood condominium

948
01:11:29.76 --> 01:11:31.76
And I

949
01:11:31.76 --> 01:11:33.76
Showed up there one time and

950
01:11:34.40 --> 01:11:40.08
You know, we're hanging out and you know the two commanders give me a little debrief on stuff and just kind of telling me how things are going

951
01:11:40.08 --> 01:11:43.44
And then someone says hey, did you see Mikey's video?

952
01:11:43.92 --> 01:11:50.24
And I go I go no and I go go see Mikey's video and so I go okay

953
01:11:50.24 --> 01:11:53.12
So they go his runs back there and what does room say on it? Oh

954
01:11:53.12 --> 01:11:57.68
Like Mikey's palace. Yeah, so I'm gonna grace story about Mikey's palace by the way

955
01:11:57.68 --> 01:11:58.68
So go ahead

956
01:11:58.68 --> 01:12:02.12
So I'm like he's so so the so the CB's have built these awesome

957
01:12:02.92 --> 01:12:04.92
plywood paradise for us and

958
01:12:05.80 --> 01:12:12.12
So you know people sleep we could sleep all different times right I mean daytime night time whatever because the obstacle was so intense and so

959
01:12:12.12 --> 01:12:15.80
Everything was totally blacked out and I got like an odd sleeping style like I can

960
01:12:16.60 --> 01:12:19.96
Well as a mole rat you know we have slightly different

961
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:22.52
Cycle so

962
01:12:22.52 --> 01:12:26.28
Mikey had a different cycle like everybody would be asleep and I would be awake

963
01:12:26.28 --> 01:12:34.44
I'm back I always could find Mikey awake and Mike so you go in you go in he was on the ground floor and so you go down and it was pitch black

964
01:12:34.44 --> 01:12:40.92
And you have like feel your way through it all these bumps and then you go down around this corner down this hallway and you make a sharp right

965
01:12:41.48 --> 01:12:47.32
And and then there would be this faint and glow coming from Mike's palace and so Mikey's bunk was

966
01:12:47.64 --> 01:12:52.52
The last one up against the wall and there was like an extra like three feet between his bunk and the wall just the way that I

967
01:12:52.52 --> 01:12:58.36
Wait worked out and so he had like these tapestries that his family had sent him hanging from the wall and

968
01:12:58.92 --> 01:13:03.80
And he'd have like poncho liners all hung out blocking the whole thing out and so it was all dark

969
01:13:03.80 --> 01:13:11.56
It was like his little cave and you go back in there and I don't know where he got him be like extra pillows on his bunk and like he had his laptop like

970
01:13:12.12 --> 01:13:13.48
Like rigged that's like a

971
01:13:13.64 --> 01:13:17.88
TV screen if you always be watching movies and he always had all kinds of gaitunk back

972
01:13:17.88 --> 01:13:23.08
So I go back in there and I go in and glow for Mikey's palace I go back in there and we just said

973
01:13:23.08 --> 01:13:29.64
Hey man you want some of these have beef jerky that's so does he'd have like romans romony rules and he'd always had

974
01:13:29.64 --> 01:13:32.60
He had like this heating element like once like you plug into the wall

975
01:13:32.60 --> 01:13:36.52
He'd like hey man and yeah cook up the heating element boiling water right there

976
01:13:36.52 --> 01:13:40.84
Or some ramen I could have ever I was hungry in the middle and I'd I could get down there to Mikey's palace

977
01:13:40.84 --> 01:13:46.52
I knew I could get some grub and he night hang out and watch movies and stuff and he's always up weird hours like man

978
01:13:46.52 --> 01:13:49.88
And it was just cool man. He had just yeah, he was cool pictures

979
01:13:50.28 --> 01:13:52.28
Postures hanging on the wall. He had that thing

980
01:13:52.84 --> 01:13:54.84
Fricked out

981
01:13:54.84 --> 01:13:59.000
Yeah, so these guys are like hey, have you seen Mikey's movie and I go no

982
01:13:59.24 --> 01:14:04.68
So I go we'll go back to Mikey's palace and check it out and so I make my way back to our same

983
01:14:04.68 --> 01:14:09.64
They either you make your way back through the dark at the head lamp on even though it's noon or something right out outside

984
01:14:09.64 --> 01:14:12.36
But the place is blocked out anyway as I get back there and

985
01:14:12.36 --> 01:14:17.000
And I'm like Mikey and and he didn't know I was

986
01:14:17.88 --> 01:14:25.000
That I was at correct or you know, so he was just you know, you know kind of like hopped to or whatever in a very

987
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.84
I don't want to make that sound too extreme, you know, but he was surprised to see the command

988
01:14:30.20 --> 01:14:34.92
But um anyways, I'm like Mikey. He's like oh, he's like hey, you know when they saw chill and I said

989
01:14:34.92 --> 01:14:38.44
Hey, let me see your movie man and he gets a smile on his face. I go okay

990
01:14:38.44 --> 01:14:43.72
This must be interesting so anyways he breaks out his camera. He's showing me the movie on the camera right

991
01:14:43.72 --> 01:14:46.92
But it's got volume and I'm sitting and watching it anyways the movie is

992
01:14:47.80 --> 01:14:53.000
It's a big firefight going on. It's just there's this is a big bad firefight

993
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.76
There's machine gun fire going off and he's literally sticking his hand up with the camera above

994
01:14:59.32 --> 01:15:03.24
And you have a roof top and he's filming when you can see stuff getting shot whatever and

995
01:15:03.24 --> 01:15:10.44
And then the funny part is he brings the camera down. He's you know hiding in this rooftop and he points the camera out himself

996
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.56
And the area of Ramadi that they were working in was a place called the Malab district and

997
01:15:16.60 --> 01:15:22.60
Like many things in the military it had taken on its own little life. It's own little legend the Malab district and

998
01:15:23.56 --> 01:15:27.88
Mikey points the camera out himself and he says it's the moolab

999
01:15:27.88 --> 01:15:32.52
Oh, baby and so it was really funny and

1000
01:15:33.96 --> 01:15:36.28
And I get done watching this and of course, I'm still you know

1001
01:15:36.92 --> 01:15:40.92
Mr. Big bad jacco and and I get done watching it. I go I go hey Mikey

1002
01:15:41.56 --> 01:15:42.76
Listen bro

1003
01:15:42.76 --> 01:15:45.64
When you're out there you shouldn't be filming stuff you need to be on your gun

1004
01:15:45.64 --> 01:15:47.88
I mean that's just that's just what you need to be doing

1005
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:52.36
You need to get on your gun and and you need to keep shooting you need to put an ounce press and fire

1006
01:15:52.92 --> 01:15:56.52
And he and he looks at me. He's kind of sheepishly you know because he felt bad he goes

1007
01:15:56.52 --> 01:15:58.52
He goes

1008
01:15:58.52 --> 01:15:59.52
He's like hey sir

1009
01:15:59.72 --> 01:16:01.72
I was out at ammo

1010
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.04
Yeah, I started laughing because that's probably 800 rounds maybe maybe more probably 121 probably 12

1011
01:16:10.04 --> 01:16:15.56
100 yeah just a massive amount of machine gun rounds that he had gone through and he had shot them all

1012
01:16:15.56 --> 01:16:20.20
That's what windchester means means you'd shot you had nothing left and he said you know

1013
01:16:20.20 --> 01:16:22.76
Sir, I sorry sir. I was I was windchester

1014
01:16:22.76 --> 01:16:31.08
I just started laughing. I was like well if you windchester makes a good movie. I guess my brother. He got after yeah, so that's uh another good

1015
01:16:31.40 --> 01:16:33.40
Mikey story

1016
01:16:33.40 --> 01:16:35.40
so

1017
01:16:36.04 --> 01:16:38.04
You actually ended up going home

1018
01:16:38.52 --> 01:16:40.52
early from deployment

1019
01:16:40.52 --> 01:16:45.32
Yep, and because you had another kid on the way. Yep, Gunner

1020
01:16:46.60 --> 01:16:48.04
He

1021
01:16:48.04 --> 01:16:55.56
Ending thing is is it's like got him in hindsight to 2020 man, you know when when man when this stuff goes like this

1022
01:16:58.28 --> 01:16:59.56
Mm

1023
01:16:59.56 --> 01:17:03.000
We had point we knew that that was gonna be the end of the deployment

1024
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.60
And so it was like all right cool, you know you just go back with the with the ad on for the reapply

1025
01:17:07.56 --> 01:17:09.56
And so that was all part of the plan

1026
01:17:09.56 --> 01:17:11.56
From day one basically. All right cool

1027
01:17:11.56 --> 01:17:14.60
Um because my first son had been born on my last deployment

1028
01:17:14.92 --> 01:17:16.92
so as it was

1029
01:17:16.92 --> 01:17:20.44
And and by the way so it started heading back what gives birth early anyway

1030
01:17:20.76 --> 01:17:23.88
So there you go two deployments two kids not there

1031
01:17:23.88 --> 01:17:25.64
Common story for a lot of military guys

1032
01:17:25.64 --> 01:17:29.64
But people who are not you know, I mean imagine I cannot be in there for you or for either of your kids

1033
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:32.12
Well, why if she's a trooper, but she was running out of steam

1034
01:17:33.24 --> 01:17:36.20
So it was cool to be able to go back and at least try to be there

1035
01:17:36.68 --> 01:17:38.36
But Gunner's always been in a hurry

1036
01:17:38.36 --> 01:17:42.20
So he came early um and then so yeah went back

1037
01:17:42.20 --> 01:17:47.16
Um, start handling the redeploy and survive that he means we're

1038
01:17:48.36 --> 01:17:53.08
Some guy comes home from deployment a little bit early to start basically preparing for us to come home

1039
01:17:53.56 --> 01:17:58.04
Getting ready for all the administrative stuff that's gonna take place and Andrew was that guy

1040
01:17:58.52 --> 01:18:03.40
And there's like that happened and then there was like three other guys it like a week later came the holiday too

1041
01:18:03.40 --> 01:18:04.76
So it was you know

1042
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:08.20
Near the end, but it tough but it tough call anyway and then

1043
01:18:08.20 --> 01:18:15.72
I mean I remember where I was when when I got the word so you know, I was back at the team and

1044
01:18:16.12 --> 01:18:18.12
I was I was actually

1045
01:18:18.28 --> 01:18:20.60
chatting with Delta Patin commander

1046
01:18:22.36 --> 01:18:29.56
The method that we use and he I'm so I knew they were going out and and I mean I just think they remember going all right

1047
01:18:29.56 --> 01:18:33.96
It gets some for me, you know, and so I was home. I got the call at like

1048
01:18:35.40 --> 01:18:37.40
12 30 at night

1049
01:18:37.40 --> 01:18:39.40
Our time local and

1050
01:18:39.40 --> 01:18:41.64
So I knew right away that was one of our guys

1051
01:18:42.44 --> 01:18:45.72
They went you know nothing over the you know over the phone specifically

1052
01:18:45.72 --> 01:18:51.40
But I knew because I had just talked to our guys, you know, and I was like got on my so I right raced into

1053
01:18:52.36 --> 01:18:57.56
So you get the call that just says come to work. Yeah get to work kind of like all right so and

1054
01:18:58.92 --> 01:19:04.76
Admittedly I'm a little frantic, you know because these are my brothers, you know, and I'm not there

1055
01:19:04.76 --> 01:19:06.76
That's really hard

1056
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:09.16
So

1057
01:19:11.40 --> 01:19:14.68
You know you can have some survivors guilt over that kind of thing. Yeah

1058
01:19:16.52 --> 01:19:20.68
You know what seems like hey look we got this deployments basically over

1059
01:19:21.48 --> 01:19:25.80
And go back thinking you're making a right decision trying to balance

1060
01:19:26.36 --> 01:19:28.36
Stuff with your family

1061
01:19:28.36 --> 01:19:32.20
And then for that to happen and you know

1062
01:19:32.20 --> 01:19:37.000
He's one of my guys he's one of my guys and I wasn't there and

1063
01:19:38.04 --> 01:19:40.04
And that's hard

1064
01:19:40.04 --> 01:19:45.56
You know, it's been almost 10 years now and time helps to heal those kinds of things

1065
01:19:46.12 --> 01:19:48.12
But I had a lot of guilt over that and

1066
01:19:48.44 --> 01:19:54.12
And so anyway, we kind of figure out what's going on. I get the brief and figure out who it is

1067
01:19:55.48 --> 01:19:56.52
So

1068
01:19:56.52 --> 01:20:01.40
Start figuring out okay, so now it's now it's a race for those of you that don't know I mean look here's a thing

1069
01:20:01.40 --> 01:20:09.64
We live in a 24 seven news world and it's a race to notify the family before they find out for some other means and

1070
01:20:10.36 --> 01:20:14.76
He lives up in Orange County so we started assembling a team and you know

1071
01:20:17.96 --> 01:20:19.96
Admirals and

1072
01:20:20.60 --> 01:20:22.60
Commodore's are involved and

1073
01:20:23.32 --> 01:20:24.84
It look

1074
01:20:24.84 --> 01:20:30.28
This is the second guy that we have not lost seals on our act to this point mark and Mike now so

1075
01:20:30.28 --> 01:20:32.28
um

1076
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:37.72
You know, it's who's gonna go to the notification and I mean like I had to like dig my heels in I was like listen

1077
01:20:37.72 --> 01:20:39.08
This is my guy

1078
01:20:39.08 --> 01:20:40.68
I'm going and

1079
01:20:40.68 --> 01:20:43.80
It was at first like and then it was like no, no, no

1080
01:20:44.28 --> 01:20:45.48
I'm going and

1081
01:20:45.88 --> 01:20:49.48
Thank God I did that because I mean I wouldn't had it in the other way

1082
01:20:50.04 --> 01:20:53.72
We're racing we put put the guys together throw the blues on we drive it up and

1083
01:20:54.20 --> 01:20:57.48
You know look when we got to my key's family's house

1084
01:20:57.48 --> 01:21:03.96
You know look at all they wanted was to talk to somebody who knew Mikey and the other four guys that were standing there

1085
01:21:04.12 --> 01:21:08.20
Didn't know didn't serve with them didn't work up with them didn't deploy with them and

1086
01:21:08.84 --> 01:21:11.80
You know in this grand scheme of God's plan

1087
01:21:11.80 --> 01:21:17.40
I have to ask you know we pulled over before pulling up the uh pulling up to the house and put on our blues

1088
01:21:17.40 --> 01:21:19.40
And I literally thought to myself okay

1089
01:21:20.36 --> 01:21:24.92
That we are about to give the worst possible news to a to a parent

1090
01:21:24.92 --> 01:21:29.72
Better kids that and I remember thinking you know

1091
01:21:30.20 --> 01:21:32.20
God just used me right now

1092
01:21:32.20 --> 01:21:35.40
I don't know why I'm here in this timing

1093
01:21:36.92 --> 01:21:39.88
But just work work through me just use me you know

1094
01:21:40.28 --> 01:21:43.08
So you know we knocked on their door and and

1095
01:21:43.96 --> 01:21:47.96
You know Mrs. Montzure looked out and she later knew you know that we

1096
01:21:48.84 --> 01:21:53.08
I mean she took a few minutes to get to the door she looked out and saw five minutes standing there and blues

1097
01:21:53.08 --> 01:22:01.08
So that was very hard you know you go in and obviously families upset and you're doing the best you can to keep it together

1098
01:22:01.08 --> 01:22:09.40
I mean for me this was my guy this was my brother and I'm standing there given them the news and trying to keep it together myself and

1099
01:22:11.32 --> 01:22:12.52
You know the

1100
01:22:12.52 --> 01:22:17.48
The good news is is that one by one they sort of looked around and said well do anybody know Mikey and I was like

1101
01:22:17.88 --> 01:22:20.36
Yeah, I knew Mikey he used mine and

1102
01:22:20.36 --> 01:22:23.48
So they you know playfully asked everybody to leave

1103
01:22:23.88 --> 01:22:30.20
But wanted me to stay and just talk about the deployment tell stories about Mikey what he was like what was going on

1104
01:22:31.16 --> 01:22:33.16
and you know I want to

1105
01:22:36.76 --> 01:22:43.000
The Montzure's are an unbelievable family and I totally want to respect their privacy

1106
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
That's right family

1107
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.96
And they're just they just been so amazingly humble and gracious through this whole thing and I just don't want to

1108
01:22:54.76 --> 01:22:59.64
Sit here and tell stories about about this right I don't want to do it

1109
01:23:05.96 --> 01:23:11.56
One of the things that the the only the only thing I'll say about this again out of

1110
01:23:11.56 --> 01:23:14.52
Just respect for the Montzure family

1111
01:23:16.44 --> 01:23:19.80
Is when you just said about about

1112
01:23:21.80 --> 01:23:26.12
You tell them what deployment was like well in talking to them

1113
01:23:27.24 --> 01:23:29.24
one of the things that

1114
01:23:29.24 --> 01:23:30.84
they said

1115
01:23:30.84 --> 01:23:32.36
was

1116
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:33.88
We're

1117
01:23:33.88 --> 01:23:41.48
Impression of the deployment so so like I said and you guys have heard stories about Ramadi and you could go and you can go on YouTube and just put Ramadi 2000s

1118
01:23:41.48 --> 01:23:43.08
Yeah, you'll see what Ramadi was like

1119
01:23:44.12 --> 01:23:46.36
That's what Ramadi was like and it was

1120
01:23:47.56 --> 01:23:51.48
Incredibly violent and crazy and these guys

1121
01:23:53.08 --> 01:24:00.28
Charlie and everything were in the thick of it in the thick of it on a almost daily basis

1122
01:24:00.28 --> 01:24:07.24
And the reason I'm building that up is because the emails that Mike had sent home to his family

1123
01:24:08.12 --> 01:24:12.76
Were oh yeah, I haven't fun not much going on here right don't worry about me

1124
01:24:12.76 --> 01:24:18.36
We're just training some Iraqis don't worry about me. Oh, we're just we're just trying to work on the infrastructure

1125
01:24:18.36 --> 01:24:23.32
Don't worry about me. It's all good here. I'll be home in a little bit though those are kind of emails

1126
01:24:23.96 --> 01:24:29.48
That he was sending home in order to make sure that his family wasn't worried about right and

1127
01:24:29.48 --> 01:24:32.52
It shows you what kind of a guy that Mike he was

1128
01:24:35.80 --> 01:24:37.80
So so

1129
01:24:39.08 --> 01:24:42.76
Any is there anything else again without without going into

1130
01:24:43.88 --> 01:24:45.40
Your personal

1131
01:24:45.40 --> 01:24:49.96
You know your personal interactions with this incredible family

1132
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.52
That you want to say and maybe from the perspective of

1133
01:24:54.52 --> 01:25:00.92
As much as I hate to say this there's gonna be other people that are gonna do this job

1134
01:25:01.40 --> 01:25:03.40
Being this person that does the notification

1135
01:25:04.68 --> 01:25:11.000
Is there anything else that you could give advice to people that have to do this job or you know

1136
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.20
If they if that ever be falls people that I mean we get a lot

1137
01:25:14.84 --> 01:25:22.04
Andrew we get a lot of big lot of military guys that that reach out to me all the time that are active duty that are doing it up to work and

1138
01:25:22.04 --> 01:25:24.04
And

1139
01:25:24.04 --> 01:25:27.32
Anything that strikes you is something that you learned from this experience

1140
01:25:28.44 --> 01:25:31.08
Here's what I learned is the worst thing I've ever done in my life and

1141
01:25:32.36 --> 01:25:34.36
The worst thing and

1142
01:25:35.08 --> 01:25:40.04
Combat itself was a piece of cake compared to this. I would love to go back to combat

1143
01:25:40.84 --> 01:25:41.80
Any

1144
01:25:41.80 --> 01:25:46.84
Issues or concerns or anything from my military service was completely centered around this

1145
01:25:46.84 --> 01:25:52.36
He is an extremely heavy burden to bear so if you're ever in this position. I don't have any good advice for you

1146
01:25:52.44 --> 01:25:58.44
There's nothing you can do to prepare yourself for this type of situation the only thing I could tell you is

1147
01:25:59.72 --> 01:26:05.08
Reach out to guys who've done it before I will gladly talk you through it because one of the best

1148
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:11.08
Salves that I've found for this kind of pain is hanging out with your brothers and spending time with them

1149
01:26:11.72 --> 01:26:14.84
I will always have time for someone who's had that be a cake. Oh always

1150
01:26:14.84 --> 01:26:20.68
Call me. Let's go out. Let's hang out. I won't suggest drinking a beer, but if it appears what you want to do will do it

1151
01:26:21.16 --> 01:26:27.000
But the bottom line is is that just the intimacy of being around another guy who's been there is very comforting

1152
01:26:27.56 --> 01:26:32.28
And so you know when you go through a stressful situation like this do not isolate yourself

1153
01:26:32.84 --> 01:26:34.84
There are other guys who have been through this and

1154
01:26:36.36 --> 01:26:41.88
And a true brother will be will be willing to take the time for you. I'll find a time for you no matter what no matter how busy I am

1155
01:26:41.88 --> 01:26:46.36
And so I just want to be a resource now. I know that there's less so many hours in the day

1156
01:26:46.36 --> 01:26:50.04
But if you're going through something if you've gone through something like this reach out to your brothers

1157
01:26:50.84 --> 01:26:56.04
Find a connection to another military guy because nobody can understand it like another military guy

1158
01:26:56.04 --> 01:27:01.48
And that's part of the stress of it part of the stress of it is is that you don't feel like you can possibly explain

1159
01:27:01.48 --> 01:27:03.000
What you're dealing with to anybody else?

1160
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.72
There's no way they could possibly understand and comprehend it

1161
01:27:05.72 --> 01:27:10.84
But another guy has been to combat can and we can sit in the room next to each other even if we sat there and said nothing

1162
01:27:10.84 --> 01:27:15.48
We would get each other and so you got to reach out to each other do not isolate

1163
01:27:17.64 --> 01:27:19.80
That's that's great advice and actually

1164
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.60
One thing that's very interesting to me is that I get emails from guys and

1165
01:27:25.72 --> 01:27:27.72
That they're basically

1166
01:27:28.04 --> 01:27:34.44
Doing that they're gonna do that right now with us. There's some of those guys out there that are that are going okay

1167
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.40
Yeah, and and the message is yeah, I mean

1168
01:27:37.40 --> 01:27:43.16
The military guys had been through this kind of stuff before again. I was never cake

1169
01:27:43.16 --> 01:27:47.24
I never even came home for my guys, you know, there was another kind of

1170
01:27:49.40 --> 01:27:53.24
Another kind of misery I guess it does know you're just sending people home

1171
01:27:55.24 --> 01:27:57.24
It's awful

1172
01:27:58.36 --> 01:28:00.04
But yeah, don't isolate yourself

1173
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Talk to your brothers

1174
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.92
Find them and tell them what you're thinking about yeah, and and this is awesome, right because

1175
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:14.04
Twitter and Facebook and messages like this, you know, we can kind of reconnect, you know

1176
01:28:14.28 --> 01:28:16.68
We can kind of talk about doing some cool stuff together

1177
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:21.64
Whether it's due jits you or running a badass race or doing something to challenge you physically or mentally

1178
01:28:21.80 --> 01:28:27.48
We all can kind of give ourselves a electronic high five, you know, if there's something badass you're still doing today

1179
01:28:27.48 --> 01:28:34.84
And you know what here's another thing to transition man, man, so so so so we so that happens

1180
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:36.84
I'm home and in

1181
01:28:37.40 --> 01:28:42.84
February 2007 I get off active duty and thanks so for those of you that don't track in the calendar here

1182
01:28:44.44 --> 01:28:46.44
Mikey died September 29th

1183
01:28:46.84 --> 01:28:48.36
2006

1184
01:28:48.36 --> 01:28:51.72
That whole thing unfolds we got home. I got home

1185
01:28:51.72 --> 01:28:56.04
I was the last with the last group to leave and we left

1186
01:28:56.60 --> 01:28:58.44
Remoddy October 21st

1187
01:28:59.16 --> 01:29:02.92
Took us a couple days to get home, but now we're home. We get post appointment leave

1188
01:29:03.32 --> 01:29:08.60
We reassemble well you do post appointment kind of debrief types up then we get post appointment leave

1189
01:29:08.84 --> 01:29:15.80
So now you're talking it's December all of a sudden December, you know October is November. It's now it's the same thanksgiving now it's on this December boom

1190
01:29:16.44 --> 01:29:17.64
And

1191
01:29:17.64 --> 01:29:24.76
So not much time has gone by it's been packed and February you're getting out of the I'm gone and that warm machine keeps cranking by the way

1192
01:29:24.76 --> 01:29:31.000
So the guys are back to right into another poll tuned they're doing pretty deployment work and whatever do whatever it just it keeps on cranking and

1193
01:29:31.48 --> 01:29:36.52
And then proof I'm out of the Navy and I jump right into the mortgage business

1194
01:29:37.16 --> 01:29:44.52
Because you know nothing like a natural transition from the seal teams and the battlefield of Ramadi to doing 30 year fixed mortgages

1195
01:29:44.52 --> 01:29:49.08
And it's and it's 2007 though. Yeah, so you actually weren't doing

1196
01:29:49.72 --> 01:29:51.72
Fixed mortgages for 30 years

1197
01:29:51.96 --> 01:29:59.80
That the mortgage industry for those of you that don't know the mortgage industry in 2007 was a place where a lot of people were making a ton of money

1198
01:30:00.36 --> 01:30:04.12
And it was about to all come to a screen. I was not making a ton of money

1199
01:30:04.12 --> 01:30:08.84
I was just like that. I was brand new right so I leave this steady two week paycheck

1200
01:30:09.48 --> 01:30:11.48
Brotherhood and a job I wanted to do

1201
01:30:11.48 --> 01:30:17.48
My entire adult life at that point and had it just came for great deployment and get into the mortgage now

1202
01:30:17.48 --> 01:30:19.24
I did that because I need to be home and by the way

1203
01:30:20.52 --> 01:30:25.96
This much of the struggle was to get out and and I really my heart was truly torn in two opposite directions

1204
01:30:26.52 --> 01:30:34.48
Man, I look back in the last nine ten years that I've had the opportunity to raise and shape my two young boys to be the young man

1205
01:30:34.48 --> 01:30:36.16
That they're becoming have been absolutely

1206
01:30:36.36 --> 01:30:38.36
priceless and

1207
01:30:38.36 --> 01:30:43.64
But you know, so I find myself February sitting in the quiet office of a mortgage office at like

1208
01:30:44.12 --> 01:30:46.44
630 in the morning because that's just how I roll

1209
01:30:46.44 --> 01:30:50.84
I got a key. I'm gonna get in there. I'm gonna figure it out and then nobody you know first guys not showing up

1210
01:30:50.84 --> 01:30:54.68
It's like nine, you know, I'm in the reading guideline books trying to just you know

1211
01:30:54.68 --> 01:31:00.68
I've no I've no paycheck. I've no income and so man it got rough. I started to struggle

1212
01:31:01.24 --> 01:31:03.24
I'm struggling

1213
01:31:03.24 --> 01:31:06.04
financially for one thing. I'm struggling emotionally

1214
01:31:06.04 --> 01:31:13.96
I'm struggling in building new relationships and you know kind of like a little bit of a chip on the shoulder and a sort of a little bit of an attitude

1215
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:18.76
From combat to trying to build relationships in the civilian world and that was tough

1216
01:31:20.12 --> 01:31:25.40
But I mean there were mornings. I sat there quietly and by the way that picture that you talked about at the beginning of this deal

1217
01:31:25.40 --> 01:31:28.40
I have that hanging on my wall. I look at it every single day and

1218
01:31:30.92 --> 01:31:34.68
One of the things that continued to drive me and for military guys who were listening

1219
01:31:34.68 --> 01:31:36.68
As corny as this may sound

1220
01:31:37.64 --> 01:31:40.12
The legacy of my brothers is what drives me

1221
01:31:40.76 --> 01:31:43.72
The opportunity to help my fellow veterans drive me

1222
01:31:44.44 --> 01:31:50.60
Because you know doing mortgages. Yeah, not super exciting right, but I sat there quietly trying to figure it out

1223
01:31:50.60 --> 01:31:56.28
I I all I got divorced. I lost a house to for closure. I showed so to another house

1224
01:31:57.24 --> 01:32:03.44
There's a time when I looked over my young son Gunner is asleep it on the floor. I got no furniture in the house a house

1225
01:32:03.44 --> 01:32:09.04
That's days from it's already been foreclosed and it's days away from the sheriff coming to say get out and

1226
01:32:10.32 --> 01:32:19.40
That drives me and I think about Mikey and the sacrifice that Mikey and Mark made and it drives me because they made a sacrifice and

1227
01:32:22.04 --> 01:32:25.14
In some ways this is this is bad talk right here and

1228
01:32:25.14 --> 01:32:32.74
In some ways I beat myself up that I wasn't on the roof that day with Mikey because that was my opportunity and I came home early for my son

1229
01:32:33.78 --> 01:32:36.82
And then I think well if I had it on that roof

1230
01:32:37.14 --> 01:32:43.46
Maybe it could have been me and then there wouldn't be a father there to raise Gunner and to raise Tristan into the next generation of warriors

1231
01:32:44.02 --> 01:32:46.42
And either way the sacrifice at Mikey made

1232
01:32:47.78 --> 01:32:51.86
He made that so that I could live and I have an obligation to

1233
01:32:51.86 --> 01:33:04.06
To use every ounce of my ability to use my mind and my body and my drive and my determination to fight in kick and scratch every single day to honor his legacy

1234
01:33:04.30 --> 01:33:10.58
To build and to mentor young men to help my fellow veterans and to make this country a greater country and

1235
01:33:11.30 --> 01:33:12.98
All those things

1236
01:33:12.98 --> 01:33:16.94
The more I do the more I feel like I can honor Mikey in his legacy and

1237
01:33:16.94 --> 01:33:23.66
To do anything else would be to slight the great sacrifice that he made and so

1238
01:33:24.14 --> 01:33:29.58
Think of your brothers if you're in a military and you're out now and you're trying to get what think your brothers honor them

1239
01:33:30.78 --> 01:33:32.78
And you and I were having dinner

1240
01:33:34.06 --> 01:33:36.30
Actually we're having dinner at the

1241
01:33:36.30 --> 01:33:40.54
Christening of the USS Michael Montsour awesome ship and

1242
01:33:40.54 --> 01:33:47.98
And you were going into that situation you just kind of rattled it off just now like it wasn't no big thing right

1243
01:33:48.86 --> 01:33:54.38
Your kid is sleeping on the floor because you have no bed no furniture you're that by the way that that

1244
01:33:54.54 --> 01:33:59.74
Paycheck you've been accustomed to getting for whatever five years in the Navy is gone

1245
01:33:59.74 --> 01:34:03.90
Right when you get out of the military after five years you don't get anything you get nothing

1246
01:34:04.22 --> 01:34:09.02
So you have no paycheck coming in but there's no salary in the mortgage industry right

1247
01:34:09.02 --> 01:34:15.10
So it's all 100% commission your son is sleeping on the floor because you have no furniture

1248
01:34:15.66 --> 01:34:21.50
You've foreclosed on one house you short sold another house and you're about to get evicted

1249
01:34:22.78 --> 01:34:24.78
That's your life at this point right

1250
01:34:26.30 --> 01:34:30.22
Not to mention in the back of your mind or in the front of your mind

1251
01:34:32.14 --> 01:34:34.14
You got this thought

1252
01:34:34.70 --> 01:34:36.70
that

1253
01:34:36.70 --> 01:34:38.70
Mikey died

1254
01:34:38.70 --> 01:34:40.70
And you weren't there right

1255
01:34:42.62 --> 01:34:45.98
How did you look at all that and

1256
01:34:48.86 --> 01:34:50.86
Shug your shoulders

1257
01:34:50.86 --> 01:34:54.94
Grit your teeth and say I'm gonna kick this things ass

1258
01:34:57.74 --> 01:35:01.90
Where did you start at the very bottom?

1259
01:35:01.90 --> 01:35:09.02
I'd like to think I bounced because I hit so hard

1260
01:35:09.34 --> 01:35:11.34
Never give up

1261
01:35:11.66 --> 01:35:20.06
The legacy of my teammates. I mean here's the deal. I think about guys that are committing suicide today or thinking about committing suicide and

1262
01:35:21.98 --> 01:35:24.22
Think about this. Do you want to give that

1263
01:35:25.18 --> 01:35:26.70
nasty

1264
01:35:26.70 --> 01:35:29.74
Enemy even one more victory

1265
01:35:29.74 --> 01:35:31.74
Fuck them

1266
01:35:33.26 --> 01:35:37.66
I am going to win because I am not going to let them defeat me

1267
01:35:39.66 --> 01:35:45.98
And I look at my boys. I pray it a lot for me. It's my faith and Jesus Christ saved me

1268
01:35:47.02 --> 01:35:49.02
So I keep fighting

1269
01:35:49.42 --> 01:35:51.42
And you know what that's just

1270
01:35:52.78 --> 01:35:57.58
Never gonna quit never you are not done until you're six feet under

1271
01:35:57.58 --> 01:35:59.58
The ain't done

1272
01:35:59.58 --> 01:36:07.50
I would tell you if I ever found myself in combat where I was shot and dying and often my own an Afghanistan or something like that for example

1273
01:36:07.90 --> 01:36:09.90
I would take the

1274
01:36:09.90 --> 01:36:11.26
Glass grenade I had

1275
01:36:11.26 --> 01:36:13.26
Pulled the pin and laid underneath myself

1276
01:36:13.82 --> 01:36:15.82
So that when the enemy came to try and get my gear

1277
01:36:16.22 --> 01:36:17.82
They blow themselves up

1278
01:36:17.82 --> 01:36:21.02
Because I am not done until I am gone

1279
01:36:21.02 --> 01:36:28.06
And even then if you've laid the right foundation the legacy you leave the messages and what you've done to help the next generation

1280
01:36:28.94 --> 01:36:29.98
That's it

1281
01:36:29.98 --> 01:36:35.58
I'm just never gonna quit never you can knock me down and I will get back up you cannot be down and I will get back up

1282
01:36:36.14 --> 01:36:39.18
I will get back up. I will get back up. They obviously

1283
01:36:40.22 --> 01:36:43.42
Well for those of you don't know because you don't know Andrew he did get back up

1284
01:36:43.90 --> 01:36:50.78
He absolutely got back up. He now runs a very successful business and is out kicking ass on a day

1285
01:36:50.78 --> 01:36:56.06
Rebase this and taking names and it's been you know a lot of this you know again

1286
01:36:57.10 --> 01:36:59.74
Whenever I look at myself and I went on this big

1287
01:37:00.70 --> 01:37:02.70
little or I went on this big kind of

1288
01:37:04.30 --> 01:37:07.26
Tyrate about how you need to mentor your people and all that

1289
01:37:08.22 --> 01:37:13.42
And take care of your brothers. Well guess what you know where I was when Andrew was going through this shit

1290
01:37:14.86 --> 01:37:16.62
I was working

1291
01:37:16.62 --> 01:37:19.26
I was working he didn't call me he didn't

1292
01:37:19.26 --> 01:37:22.14
And I didn't make myself available

1293
01:37:23.02 --> 01:37:25.02
You know so you

1294
01:37:26.06 --> 01:37:32.14
Go go you know taking care of of your friends goes beyond just when they ask for help

1295
01:37:32.14 --> 01:37:34.22
You need to seek them out and make sure that they're doing all right

1296
01:37:34.78 --> 01:37:37.42
Because I let him go and that was that

1297
01:37:37.98 --> 01:37:43.34
Get out of the Navy and it was bye bye and keep in mind. I wasn't gonna come and ask you because maybe I was a little embarrassed

1298
01:37:43.34 --> 01:37:49.82
You know about how dire my situation was so if you're a leader just know just like kids who are going through buds

1299
01:37:49.82 --> 01:37:51.42
They're gonna hide their injuries

1300
01:37:51.42 --> 01:37:55.90
Right because you know I don't want to come to the guy who I respect and say hey, I am flat out right now, bro

1301
01:37:56.22 --> 01:38:01.18
You know so I'm just gonna keep digging and I know we talked about it. You're like man. Why didn't you come to me?

1302
01:38:02.38 --> 01:38:04.86
I don't you know what it wasn't a mine hatred to do so

1303
01:38:05.98 --> 01:38:09.42
Maybe that wasn't the best decision. Maybe I should have reached out but

1304
01:38:09.42 --> 01:38:11.42
Either way, I wasn't gonna quit

1305
01:38:14.14 --> 01:38:16.14
Well, that's awesome and it's awesome to see

1306
01:38:17.10 --> 01:38:19.10
What you've done

1307
01:38:19.10 --> 01:38:25.74
See where you're at now like I said kicking ass and taking maids and and raising to a badass young man

1308
01:38:26.14 --> 01:38:30.54
They're good boys man the next generation of warriors. That's one of the things I'll be compassionate about I'll tell you

1309
01:38:30.54 --> 01:38:31.90
You know

1310
01:38:31.90 --> 01:38:33.90
When you get out any transition

1311
01:38:33.90 --> 01:38:39.18
It is it's hard because you leave this brotherhood you leave this common scent this common goal and you know

1312
01:38:39.18 --> 01:38:42.38
You're fighting for freedom you're fighting for liberty and you're fighting for your brother and your sister

1313
01:38:42.38 --> 01:38:44.22
You're right left and then you get into some

1314
01:38:45.02 --> 01:38:47.02
Job where you're sitting in a desk

1315
01:38:47.90 --> 01:38:49.90
Type it on a computer which is boring

1316
01:38:50.94 --> 01:38:55.82
So you have to look here's a deal you have to find a purpose behind what you're doing and

1317
01:38:56.78 --> 01:38:59.10
Mortgage is like seriously jumping out of planes

1318
01:38:59.42 --> 01:39:01.18
Blown things up shooting guns diving

1319
01:39:01.58 --> 01:39:05.10
Rebreathers all all high ends up to doing 30-year-fix mortgages. I mean

1320
01:39:05.10 --> 01:39:10.86
Wall wall I mean how do you how do you get excited about that look you don't you don't get excited about doing that

1321
01:39:10.86 --> 01:39:14.30
All right, I'm really honestly what you get excited about is something else behind it and for me

1322
01:39:14.30 --> 01:39:15.82
It's helping my fellow veterans so

1323
01:39:15.82 --> 01:39:21.10
You don't know nine people show my business. I do VA loans. Okay, so why because I want to help my fellow veterans

1324
01:39:21.42 --> 01:39:26.46
Nobody will take care of that or better. And I will and that's that's my mantra right if if if if a guy goes down the street

1325
01:39:26.46 --> 01:39:28.46
You will not be taking care of

1326
01:39:28.70 --> 01:39:33.18
Better than if he comes to me because I am deeply passionate about helping my fellow veterans

1327
01:39:33.18 --> 01:39:39.98
And that's how I get passionate about the job that I do now. I find a purpose behind what I'm doing and so you might be in some job now that you're out

1328
01:39:40.22 --> 01:39:42.22
And you might be a god just

1329
01:39:42.46 --> 01:39:43.90
Sox you know

1330
01:39:43.90 --> 01:39:47.26
But find a reason behind it could be a small thing

1331
01:39:47.58 --> 01:39:52.62
Right like there were jobs in the military that sucked. There were jobs there there's parts of every job that sucks

1332
01:39:53.58 --> 01:39:58.54
You just got to deal with it. That's life and find a purpose behind what you're doing and then and then

1333
01:39:58.54 --> 01:40:02.62
I'll just tell you this is a this is like one of these secrets of life that I have found

1334
01:40:03.50 --> 01:40:07.98
Life is easier when you find a way to help somebody else when you find a way to help somebody else

1335
01:40:08.62 --> 01:40:11.82
Miraculously your problems begin to go away

1336
01:40:12.78 --> 01:40:17.82
So focus on somebody else's problems and how you can help them and all of a sudden you forget about yours

1337
01:40:18.62 --> 01:40:22.86
And so find a way to help other veterans. I see guys. I see veterans today who are

1338
01:40:22.86 --> 01:40:29.10
Who have been blown up and lost limbs and had been in similar difficult situations and they are make they're doing

1339
01:40:29.50 --> 01:40:35.58
Fantastic because they've started organizations or leading organizations or deeply involved in organizations that are helping fellow veterans

1340
01:40:35.98 --> 01:40:42.06
And there it is. It's like this mirror. It's like this miracle. You sit out to help somebody else and I'll have sudden your problems

1341
01:40:42.06 --> 01:40:45.02
Just seem to melt away. So if you're struggling right now

1342
01:40:46.86 --> 01:40:48.86
You can reach out to me

1343
01:40:48.86 --> 01:40:51.50
Facebook Twitter whatever just share your story

1344
01:40:51.50 --> 01:40:54.70
Connect and then find a way to help someone else

1345
01:40:55.50 --> 01:41:01.58
And do it in a way that you're passionate about man. I mean I'm passionate about raising my two boys into the next generation of warriors

1346
01:41:01.58 --> 01:41:05.66
I'm I'm passionate about I mean for it's look around at the

1347
01:41:05.82 --> 01:41:08.78
Spindless cowards that society is raising today

1348
01:41:09.50 --> 01:41:15.74
Who is raising the next generation of warriors to keep America the greatest country on the planet

1349
01:41:15.74 --> 01:41:22.46
This generation that says that everybody gets a trophy that you get a freaking

1350
01:41:23.50 --> 01:41:28.46
Graduation certificate when you graduate from first grade that's bullshit all right

1351
01:41:29.26 --> 01:41:32.70
So you get a piece of coal going to kick in the ass, that's right

1352
01:41:33.66 --> 01:41:38.30
You get something when you earn something and so raising my boys into

1353
01:41:38.30 --> 01:41:48.38
It's hard young men to become gentlemen strong warriors men of character who wills who will have a spine and stand for something

1354
01:41:48.94 --> 01:41:52.94
That's what we need to do and those you guys have been to combat certain arm military

1355
01:41:53.18 --> 01:41:55.18
You know how to do that

1356
01:41:55.18 --> 01:41:57.82
If you don't have kids find a way to involve in local high school

1357
01:41:58.14 --> 01:42:05.18
Maybe a local middle school instead of be a role model and set an example for some young boys to be the next generation of badass American warrior

1358
01:42:05.18 --> 01:42:10.78
Who will stand for and protect this country and protect liberty? That's something to get pretty excited about I get passionate about that

1359
01:42:12.06 --> 01:42:16.38
Yeah, that's something that everybody needs to get passionate about and like you said especially the veterans that

1360
01:42:17.90 --> 01:42:23.26
That no one understand that and they no one understand and appreciate what real freedom is that's right

1361
01:42:25.42 --> 01:42:27.42
Well, I think that's

1362
01:42:28.22 --> 01:42:30.22
All we've got for tonight

1363
01:42:30.22 --> 01:42:31.42
Jimmy

1364
01:42:31.42 --> 01:42:33.98
Closing comments. I think you just about summed up

1365
01:42:37.10 --> 01:42:39.10
Well first and foremost

1366
01:42:39.90 --> 01:42:40.94
Andrew

1367
01:42:40.94 --> 01:42:42.94
Thanks for your service

1368
01:42:42.94 --> 01:42:49.82
Thank you for answering the nations call and I appreciate what you did for me and what you did for the teams

1369
01:42:51.18 --> 01:42:58.30
Thanks for coming on the podcast and sharing your lessons learn not only about combat, but about what comes after combat

1370
01:42:58.30 --> 01:43:00.30
That

1371
01:43:00.14 --> 01:43:03.18
Then for those of you out there listening to the podcast

1372
01:43:04.62 --> 01:43:08.38
And you want to keep listening to podcast you want to support the podcast

1373
01:43:09.74 --> 01:43:12.06
My brother echo Charles gonna tell you how to do that

1374
01:43:13.34 --> 01:43:19.10
Before I tell you I actually have a question yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a way light-hearted question compared to let's go

1375
01:43:19.98 --> 01:43:24.62
So when you go into the mortgage industry, yeah, and you know there's other people in the office as well

1376
01:43:24.62 --> 01:43:33.18
Like what did they think about did they know you know you're you're you're past they find out you know, but it's hard to right because in the seal teams we have

1377
01:43:34.30 --> 01:43:35.82
We have a quiet

1378
01:43:35.82 --> 01:43:39.34
Professionalism and so one of the things that I've struggled with is you know

1379
01:43:39.66 --> 01:43:44.06
Look, I'm I'm certainly proud of my service, but I don't want to use my service in my background in the seal team

1380
01:43:44.06 --> 01:43:49.82
Does a way to advertise and there are many there are douchebags in the mortgage business who pray on

1381
01:43:49.82 --> 01:43:54.78
Military dude and and they've got some great fancy marketing, but they're hard to not in the right place

1382
01:43:55.02 --> 01:43:56.14
So

1383
01:43:56.14 --> 01:44:00.14
Relationships little by little it it sneaks out and it's fine of other people know, but no

1384
01:44:00.14 --> 01:44:02.94
I don't walk in there and tell people that it hey, I'm a Navy seal. I mean

1385
01:44:02.94 --> 01:44:07.26
You know, Tony was just on a week and yeah, and I don't know why we've never talked about this before

1386
01:44:07.26 --> 01:44:11.18
I've never talked about this before but like anyone that actually calls themselves a Navy seal

1387
01:44:11.58 --> 01:44:14.62
It's like suspect right here. Hey, how's it going? I'm a Navy seal

1388
01:44:14.62 --> 01:44:17.26
All right, what's the name of seal? They're just so like you can tell me you're going away

1389
01:44:17.26 --> 01:44:24.14
Just like what's this guys deal right? All right, just no right no right exactly but like you like okay

1390
01:44:24.14 --> 01:44:28.46
Jocca walks in we meet Jocco for example and

1391
01:44:29.10 --> 01:44:32.14
He's you know whatever he's Jocco we're gonna be kind of like hey

1392
01:44:33.98 --> 01:44:38.86
Are you in maybe seal kind of thing but you you're kind of like in every day guy

1393
01:44:38.86 --> 01:44:42.94
I kind of do so you're like kind of like the guy in the movie who they show him work

1394
01:44:42.94 --> 01:44:46.14
You know whatever and it flashes back to his passing he's kind of the superhero

1395
01:44:46.14 --> 01:44:48.14
You know you're like one of those kind guys

1396
01:44:50.14 --> 01:44:53.66
Do they like do you think that they looked at you like that like oh yeah

1397
01:44:53.66 --> 01:44:58.62
You're just you know our guy co-worker kind of thing but and then maybe one guy heard a room right this guy is you know

1398
01:44:58.62 --> 01:45:01.82
This this the heart and warrior and they're the other guys like no

1399
01:45:01.82 --> 01:45:06.22
No way look at that you know me. Yeah, it's um and that's how I'd prefer it

1400
01:45:06.22 --> 01:45:09.58
I mean I'd rather be oh they've not knowing yeah, I'd rather be in the shadow

1401
01:45:09.58 --> 01:45:11.02
I mean cuz look here's a deal

1402
01:45:11.02 --> 01:45:18.70
None of us do this for acolyte none of us do this for the look at me and the guys who advertise like Jocco say and they're suspect because they probably didn't really do it

1403
01:45:18.70 --> 01:45:19.50
You know

1404
01:45:19.50 --> 01:45:27.02
But I'd say probably one of the best compliments I probably ever got was I heard about a conversation that happened when I wasn't there and

1405
01:45:27.50 --> 01:45:33.30
This guy was like yeah, did you know that guys a navy seal and the other person said no

1406
01:45:33.30 --> 01:45:35.94
Well, wait guys. He's so nice. You know

1407
01:45:35.94 --> 01:45:40.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it means. Yeah, I'd rather be I'd rather be stealth like that

1408
01:45:40.36 --> 01:45:42.94
So you know it makes even more interesting is again

1409
01:45:42.94 --> 01:45:47.66
We'll use Jocco as an example if Jocco kind of walks in a room and guys, you know

1410
01:45:47.66 --> 01:45:49.94
Let's say a trouble maker guy. Yeah, they're gonna look at him be like

1411
01:45:49.94 --> 01:45:53.30
I don't know. I'll start and being with this guy big

1412
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:55.62
Minot have been a you know a team guy

1413
01:45:55.90 --> 01:45:59.74
But then you you don't have that to look at you know but not only

1414
01:46:01.42 --> 01:46:03.42
And you know you did to though

1415
01:46:03.42 --> 01:46:06.96
To me that makes it even more it yeah, but that's all you need really

1416
01:46:07.50 --> 01:46:12.80
So it makes it that much more interesting to me, you know and it's great right because you know what a lot of times

1417
01:46:13.42 --> 01:46:19.14
But I would say more often than not when we if we were out as a puttune guys would actually

1418
01:46:19.14 --> 01:46:23.72
Wanna start a fight with a guy that looks like Jocco because they're they're looking to like test themselves

1419
01:46:23.72 --> 01:46:27.70
Yeah, whereas like guys I mean that would be a massive miscalculation

1420
01:46:27.70 --> 01:46:33.20
You know like really end of life event extinction my event kind of decision

1421
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.16
To be not to counter I know exactly what you're saying but like

1422
01:46:37.84 --> 01:46:43.000
The facts are people don't mess with me when I'm out in public. Yeah, they just don't but I know exactly what you're talking about

1423
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.26
It's always some big guy the tall guy. I get somebody coming up to him and

1424
01:46:47.14 --> 01:46:50.82
And actually you know you and I talked about this too for those of you are on the podcast

1425
01:46:50.82 --> 01:46:54.96
You can't you know that are listening and you doesn't look like stereotypical seal

1426
01:46:54.96 --> 01:46:56.46
He's a hundred and fifty five pounds

1427
01:46:56.46 --> 01:47:02.72
He's what it how tall are you five seven five seven Susan look he's not your stereotypical

1428
01:47:03.12 --> 01:47:07.62
seal looking guy now again that the public with that the public with things I guys gonna say

1429
01:47:07.62 --> 01:47:12.32
There's no stereotype and some of the most badass guys are there every size

1430
01:47:12.90 --> 01:47:16.74
But this is something that Andrew said to me one time which was

1431
01:47:17.74 --> 01:47:21.76
You know he's you know basically people see me and what do they think they think oh this guy

1432
01:47:21.76 --> 01:47:26.68
You know, he's just gonna be a knuckle dragger and and he thinks everybody needs to be big giant

1433
01:47:27.44 --> 01:47:31.76
You know head smashers right and the fact of the matter is

1434
01:47:32.32 --> 01:47:34.32
What what I care about is?

1435
01:47:34.80 --> 01:47:38.52
Can you do your job and can you do it well are you tough? Are you brave?

1436
01:47:38.92 --> 01:47:42.76
Can you lead and that's why Andrew I?

1437
01:47:44.12 --> 01:47:48.64
He was like actually surprised like when you finally told me you know you like man, you know

1438
01:47:48.64 --> 01:47:52.68
I was kind of thought you might not like me, you know because

1439
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.32
You know smaller and and

1440
01:47:56.92 --> 01:47:59.52
You know I don't look like a seal and I was like bro

1441
01:47:59.60 --> 01:48:04.36
It's not about how what you look like it's about how you act and can you do this job?

1442
01:48:04.56 --> 01:48:10.000
Are you brave or are you gonna step up can you lead great example leadership right like that's what you that's what you

1443
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.16
That was one point you focused on what was the capability of the person your team not what they look like and and some guys can do that

1444
01:48:15.16 --> 01:48:19.60
Right they can they can go well, you know this or that but you were like I don't know them in this guy

1445
01:48:19.60 --> 01:48:22.000
He puts out and get job done he's leading

1446
01:48:22.32 --> 01:48:27.24
So you know your kind of like you some Dalton you're but watch roadhouse

1447
01:48:28.16 --> 01:48:31.76
Oh, I remember yeah when they were like hey, I thought you'd be bigger

1448
01:48:31.76 --> 01:48:35.000
He's this badass sponsor with the right right that a bad comparison

1449
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Will that give me killed that bro?

1450
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.44
