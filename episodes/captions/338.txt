[00:00:00] This is Jockelbodcast number 338 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jockel Willink, good evening echo.
[00:00:05] When I was teaching close quarters combat,
[00:00:10] which is, you know, going into rooms, going into buildings,
[00:00:15] and clearing rooms, and clearing buildings, clearing hallways,
[00:00:18] clearing stairwells, there's all kinds of things
[00:00:21] that a seal has to do correctly when they do this,
[00:00:25] and there are a lot of rules.
[00:00:27] A lot of standard operating procedures that you have to follow,
[00:00:30] how you enter the room, where your feet go,
[00:00:35] where you aim your weapon, and where you don't aim your weapon.
[00:00:38] How far you stay off the wall, what you say to your shooting buddy
[00:00:44] when you need to move, what you, how you respond to your shooting buddy,
[00:00:48] when he needs to move.
[00:00:49] There's a bunch of verbal and non-verbal signals that you give
[00:00:56] with your voice, with your weapon, with your posture, with your actions.
[00:01:01] You got to know how to give those signals, you got to know how to receive those signals.
[00:01:05] And then there's a bunch of calls that you actually make,
[00:01:08] and again, some of those calls you make, and you pass that word via
[00:01:12] verbal or other types of visual signals,
[00:01:16] when to move, where to move, what to address,
[00:01:22] in a particular room or in a hallway or in a building,
[00:01:25] because you got to prioritize an execute,
[00:01:28] and you go into room, there's multiple things going on.
[00:01:30] You got to figure out which one's the most important one.
[00:01:32] You got to support your shooting buddy at all times.
[00:01:35] That's covered move.
[00:01:36] You got to do all this with simple clear concise communication.
[00:01:40] You got to make sure that while you're doing all these things,
[00:01:42] you're supporting the overall intent to the mission,
[00:01:44] which is decentralized command.
[00:01:46] So there's a whole bunch of things going on.
[00:01:50] When you're doing close quarters combat,
[00:01:54] and when I taught this,
[00:01:57] there was, you know, we as instructor,
[00:02:00] cadre would get really critical about
[00:02:06] the actions that the guys entering, the room,
[00:02:08] made, because we wanted them to stay tight on the SOPs,
[00:02:12] because imagine you enter a room and you go
[00:02:14] where you're not supposed to go,
[00:02:16] you can get shot by your partner.
[00:02:18] So you got to get guys to do the right thing,
[00:02:21] and then they've got to be able to make decisions,
[00:02:23] they've got to be able to make decisions quickly.
[00:02:25] And so us as cadre,
[00:02:28] we would definitely help on these guys
[00:02:31] and give them firm critique when they screwed something up,
[00:02:35] and you're too far off the wall,
[00:02:36] or you should address that open door first,
[00:02:38] or you can clear behind that couch over there.
[00:02:40] So we're getting on these guys,
[00:02:43] and there's a million points to critique and criticize,
[00:02:47] and we did that.
[00:02:51] And again, the reason we did that was to make sure
[00:02:53] that they follow the SOPs,
[00:02:54] because when you get into a platoon or you're in a platoon,
[00:02:57] and you don't follow the SOPs,
[00:02:58] there's some SOPs if you don't follow them in CQC,
[00:03:03] you can get yourself killed, you can get your buddy killed,
[00:03:05] you can get the everybody killed.
[00:03:07] So we're hyper critical.
[00:03:10] Now, as I watch that,
[00:03:13] as my cadre, as I watch my cadre,
[00:03:16] I sort of detached and would let the cadre
[00:03:19] sort of run those finer points of the standard operating procedures.
[00:03:24] And I got to a point where,
[00:03:27] I would talk to guys when they do something wrong,
[00:03:32] where I'd say, hey, you did what you did.
[00:03:39] Let's figure out why.
[00:03:41] So in other words, oh, echo went into the room,
[00:03:44] and he addressed this door instead of that couch first,
[00:03:49] and I could say, hey, that door was open.
[00:03:51] It's a big, I would say, hey, echo,
[00:03:53] you addressed the couch and you turned your back on the door.
[00:03:57] What were you thinking about?
[00:03:58] Because I wanted to know why you did it,
[00:04:00] so that I can learn more,
[00:04:04] and I can allow me to teach better.
[00:04:06] If I know why you did something,
[00:04:08] and you say, well, you know,
[00:04:09] I thought that the biggest threat was the one that was closest to me.
[00:04:11] Well, this one might be further away,
[00:04:13] but if it's a bigger space to hide
[00:04:16] behind whatever the case may be.
[00:04:19] So, as I learned why people made mistakes
[00:04:24] that helped me be able to teach these things better,
[00:04:28] because then I could close some of those loose ends,
[00:04:30] as I'm teaching it.
[00:04:32] And I took this to other areas of training,
[00:04:34] as well, especially with the leaders, right?
[00:04:36] Especially with the leaders, the young,
[00:04:37] see the leaders trying to understand,
[00:04:39] not just what they did wrong,
[00:04:40] and point out to them what they did wrong,
[00:04:43] but why they did it, so that I could adjust the training
[00:04:47] to address the shortfall, and I could address,
[00:04:50] and adjust my own methodology of instruction
[00:04:54] to make sure that I explained it in a way
[00:04:56] that they understood why we were doing something a certain way.
[00:05:01] So, I need to figure out, I needed to figure out
[00:05:04] what they were thinking and why they were thinking it,
[00:05:07] and I learned a lot from doing that.
[00:05:10] And of course, we would do this type of thing after missions,
[00:05:13] as well, you know, the debrief.
[00:05:15] We get on with a mission, we immediately are going to go do a debrief.
[00:05:19] What happened, why it happened, what we could do better,
[00:05:23] and of course, if we had a someone on the team
[00:05:27] that mess something up, I would talk to them about why they did it,
[00:05:30] not just remo-out because they screwed up,
[00:05:33] but hey, what were you thinking when you made that move?
[00:05:35] What were you thinking, why did you move into that building?
[00:05:37] What did you think was going to happen?
[00:05:42] And, you know, if you read Extreme Ownership,
[00:05:44] the first chapter after the blue on blue,
[00:05:47] of course, we obviously debriefed,
[00:05:48] and we created some new standard operating procedures
[00:05:51] to prevent it from happening again,
[00:05:55] or at least mitigate the risk as much as we could.
[00:05:57] And if you read the rest of the book,
[00:05:59] there were even more situations that we talk about in the book
[00:06:03] that were close to being catastrophic,
[00:06:08] fracture sites, catastrophic blue on blues.
[00:06:11] But we were able to stop those from happening
[00:06:14] either from our procedures that we had put in place,
[00:06:17] or our better understanding of what could unfold,
[00:06:20] or our awareness of what was happening.
[00:06:24] And when I got home from that deployment,
[00:06:27] I debriefed that operation, that blue on blue,
[00:06:30] I debriefed over and over again to the seal teams
[00:06:34] and the platoons that were going through training,
[00:06:35] and the troops that were going through training,
[00:06:37] to try and pass on the lessons learned to everyone,
[00:06:40] and then we set up training
[00:06:44] that we organized the training
[00:06:47] so that those lessons learned would get embedded
[00:06:51] into these young seal leaders.
[00:06:53] They would understand how these things happened,
[00:06:55] so they could prevent them from happening,
[00:06:57] and I was told many times over the years,
[00:07:01] that the training and awareness that we gave people,
[00:07:07] prevented many friendly fire incidences from happening.
[00:07:10] And in case in point Jason Gardner's got a few
[00:07:13] in that he that happened to him on his deployment
[00:07:16] to Afghanistan where he straight up said,
[00:07:19] you know, like, if I wouldn't have been aware,
[00:07:21] we wouldn't have had that blue on blue training,
[00:07:24] that this we probably would have had a blue on blue for real.
[00:07:27] So I heard that many times.
[00:07:32] Now, a lot of people have been asking me
[00:07:38] about the horrific scenario that unfolded
[00:07:41] in Evaldae, Texas.
[00:07:48] Psychotic and socio-pathic gunmen entered a school
[00:07:52] and killed 19 innocent children and two adults.
[00:07:58] And I can't even fathom the grief and the fact that
[00:08:05] the just trauma for those families, the horror, the whole
[00:08:12] in their lives that they have now that can never be replaced.
[00:08:18] And the potential of life that was thrown away
[00:08:28] before it even had a chance to grow.
[00:08:30] And it's just a completely heart-breaking situation.
[00:08:38] And what has made the situation even harder to process
[00:08:45] was the response from law enforcement on the scene.
[00:08:51] And of course, we all like to think about and talk about what I would have done.
[00:08:58] But I would have done if I were there.
[00:09:01] And I get that, everyone is horrified by what took place.
[00:09:06] And we all like to think that we would have been brave
[00:09:11] or that we would have been more decisive
[00:09:12] that we would have had more situational awareness
[00:09:14] that we would have handled the scenario in a way
[00:09:17] that created a better outcome.
[00:09:19] Of course, we all like to, we would all give anything
[00:09:26] to be able to create a better outcome in that situation.
[00:09:32] And unfortunately, the situation has already happened.
[00:09:37] The outcome is complete.
[00:09:41] And we can't change what happened.
[00:09:45] And what the response was, any more than I could change the decision
[00:09:48] a young seal made when he walked into Roman, moved the wrong way,
[00:09:52] or addressed the wrong threat, I couldn't change what he had done.
[00:09:59] I could tell him what he did wrong, but what I really needed to do
[00:10:03] as I said was to understand why he made that decision
[00:10:09] and learn from it.
[00:10:11] And then figure out how I could teach other people
[00:10:14] to not make that mistake.
[00:10:15] And that is unfortunately the best I can offer in this
[00:10:22] situation as well.
[00:10:24] Now, there are other things to talk about
[00:10:30] with regards to contributing factors in this situation.
[00:10:35] And you've got mental health, you've got media violence,
[00:10:38] you've got dehumanization of people, you've got gun laws,
[00:10:42] and they're enforcement or lack of enforcement.
[00:10:45] And I talked about some of those on the Jocco and Ravling podcast
[00:10:50] with Darrell Cooper and all those, the thing is with all those,
[00:10:55] those are massive subjects.
[00:10:58] Those are massive subjects, all of them that are being discussed
[00:11:01] at the national level and will take some unified efforts
[00:11:08] to solve.
[00:11:09] They'll take some unified efforts and by that I mean people actually
[00:11:12] working together, which we don't seem to have any of.
[00:11:15] So as that conversation continues to take place,
[00:11:21] I just want to look at what happened
[00:11:25] tactically on the ground and try and figure out why it happened.
[00:11:32] And I'm going to use a timeline, follow a timeline from the Texas Tribune.
[00:11:36] It was last updated on June 9th and just just to note,
[00:11:43] we're recording this today on June 13th, 2022.
[00:11:49] And it's just based on simple open source reporting.
[00:11:53] And I'm sure that there will be more detailed information available in the future
[00:11:58] and maybe at some point we'll go over it with more detail.
[00:12:01] But the thing is there are lessons to be learned
[00:12:05] even from what we know right now
[00:12:08] that that I want to talk a little bit about again from the tactical perspective
[00:12:12] to try and figure out why things happened like this in this event.
[00:12:18] So again from the Texas Tribune, this is May 24th, 2022 around 11am.
[00:12:25] The shooter sends Facebook messages.
[00:12:28] The shooter sends private Facebook messages to a girl in Germany.
[00:12:31] He met online and tells her about his plans to shoot his grandmother.
[00:12:35] The gunman shoots his grandmother in the face and calls the police.
[00:12:43] The shooter steals his grandmother's vehicle and drives from his home
[00:12:48] to Rob Elementary School, which is about two miles away.
[00:12:54] So there you have a clear declaration that something bad is going to happen made by the
[00:13:01] individual himself and I don't know if there's some kind of a social media 911 call that you can make.
[00:13:10] It seems like there should be some kind of a social media 911 to call
[00:13:20] where if someone is making threats of violence via social media that people that see these threats
[00:13:28] can have someone to contact where action can be taken.
[00:13:36] And I don't know if there is an AI that can screen for things like this.
[00:13:42] My guess is yes considering that if I Google search something on my phone or on my laptop
[00:13:52] the very next screen that I click I get advertisements for whatever that thing that I just searched is.
[00:13:56] So to think that we couldn't come up with or that the tech companies couldn't come up with something
[00:14:03] that was coming through messages coming through posts looking for threatening content.
[00:14:11] It seems like that would be a feasible thing.
[00:14:15] And at a minimum to have something where there's like a universal 911 call to make if someone is posting
[00:14:24] threatening things it seems like that would be a move that would be over the help
[00:14:29] these when these situations unfold.
[00:14:35] Moving to 1128 AM the shooter arrives at the school.
[00:14:40] The shooter crashes the vehicle into a ditch near the school.
[00:14:42] He fires his gun at two male witnesses who began approaching the crash from a nearby funeral home.
[00:14:48] The witness is fleeing call 911.
[00:14:50] So this is at 1128.
[00:14:58] When you get a shooter that's in the vicinity of a school there's got to be a really good lockdown
[00:15:05] protocol that happens.
[00:15:09] And this is something when we talk about lockdown protocol
[00:15:15] one thing that that I think needs to be discussed is if you have a shooter that's
[00:15:23] external to the school lock the doors.
[00:15:28] But when you have a shooter that's in the school
[00:15:32] everyone should get the hell out of the school.
[00:15:34] You shouldn't keep people in the school anymore.
[00:15:38] So having a couple different immediate action drills
[00:15:42] when it comes to when when when when a shooter is either in a school we're going to get out of the school.
[00:15:49] If it's outside the school we're going to stay in the school we're going to lock it down.
[00:15:53] Those require two different reactions not one.
[00:15:58] Because if there's a shooter in the school you should get the hell out of the school.
[00:16:06] 1130 AM a teacher calls 911.
[00:16:10] Teacher at the elementary school makes a 911 call reporting the crash and seeing the shooter noting he has a gun.
[00:16:18] The shooter walks toward the school climbs the fence into the parking lot and shoots at the school several times.
[00:16:26] Again, if the shooters outside the school we should have an instant protocol to keep them outside the school.
[00:16:32] 1131 AM shooter walks into school parking lot.
[00:16:39] The shooter reaches the last row of vehicles in the school parking lot firing his rifle throughout.
[00:16:46] Police arrive at the funeral home.
[00:16:47] So you remember the people that initially reacted to the crash they ran back to a funeral home called the police.
[00:16:53] The police now arrive at the funeral home.
[00:16:55] A school district police officer speeds in the direction of a person they think is the man with the gun
[00:17:00] reported by the teacher but drives past the gunmen and heads to the back of the school
[00:17:04] mistaking a teacher for the shooter.
[00:17:10] So you have a problem of positive identification now.
[00:17:15] Where you got teachers who are the only adults in the schools except for the shooter.
[00:17:21] So how are you going to tell them apart?
[00:17:24] This is where we look and say hey is there an armband that we have?
[00:17:28] Is there an emergency everyone knows to put on a certain t-shirt or a certain vest?
[00:17:34] And you know you might be thinking all that sounds stupid.
[00:17:36] If you've ever been into a combat situation where there's multiple people running around on the battlefield,
[00:17:42] positive identification is a real problem.
[00:17:45] It is really hard to identify who's who.
[00:17:50] And you can make it a lot easier if you throw if you give people some kind of a uniform to put on where,
[00:17:55] oh all the teachers are wearing a vest that says teacher on it.
[00:17:59] On orange vest.
[00:18:11] 11.33 am the shooter enters the school.
[00:18:16] Shooter enters the school for the back through the back door.
[00:18:18] He shoots at least 100 rounds inside classes, classrooms 11 11 and 112 which are connected.
[00:18:28] Authorities originally said a teacher left the door prompt open, but later said a teacher
[00:18:33] closed the door and the automatic lock failed.
[00:18:38] And there's she's the a quote here.
[00:18:41] She remembers pulling the door closed while telling 911 that he was shooting.
[00:18:45] She thought the door would lock because the door is always supposed to lock.
[00:18:53] I've heard some people talk about
[00:18:58] the horrible idea of or what seems like a horrible idea of turning schools into
[00:19:07] you know bunkers type of thing.
[00:19:09] Oh we can have our guards every.
[00:19:11] And look no one wants to bring their kids to a school where the school feels like it's a reverse
[00:19:18] prison right or some kind of a prison environment where you've got barbed wire and you've got bars
[00:19:22] on the window and all this kind of stuff.
[00:19:24] No one wants to bring their their kids to school like that.
[00:19:26] But there is a way to properly secure schools where it doesn't look like some prison camp.
[00:19:36] There's absolutely a way to make that happen.
[00:19:42] And I think that just about any parent I think actually any parent would be okay
[00:19:48] with having some security in place so that the school is a place where people can't get into
[00:19:57] unless they're supposed to be there.
[00:19:58] So the back doors open look does this mean I'm a little bit paranoid?
[00:20:09] Mate yes.
[00:20:12] Yeah little bit paranoid and I think a little bit of paranoia is actually okay.
[00:20:19] A little bit of paranoia is actually okay.
[00:20:21] So that was at 1133.
[00:20:30] At 1135 the the Uvalde police enter the school.
[00:20:41] Three police officers rushed to the same door that the gunman used to enter which was closed.
[00:20:44] They enter receive grazing wounds from the gunman they retreat.
[00:20:54] So response time has been, well 1128 AM the shooter arrives at the school.
[00:21:01] 1131 he's walking through the parking lot 1133 he enters the school.
[00:21:06] The police arrive pretty quickly.
[00:21:08] Now if there was some kind of security guard there I guess what response time is zero minutes.
[00:21:17] And does this mean that your kid feels like he's going to school in a in a damn prison?
[00:21:23] Because there's a plain closed security guard there.
[00:21:30] I'm okay with that.
[00:21:32] Do I love it?
[00:21:33] No I don't.
[00:21:39] But this is not that big of a price to pay to keep kids safe.
[00:21:46] The idea that a guard or an armed guard has to be some over presence
[00:21:54] that the kids have to walk by to get to class.
[00:21:56] Oh there's you know Mr. Fred with the with the AR 15 guarding us.
[00:22:04] I feel intimidated because I'm a little kid I don't like I don't like it.
[00:22:06] It makes me feel uncomfortable.
[00:22:08] Does it have to be like no it doesn't actually have to be that way at all.
[00:22:13] There can be a very low visibility option for that.
[00:22:19] And it can be a low visibility option that the children don't know much about but the
[00:22:22] public does know about and therefore it also you it also causes deterrence for a would be school shooter.
[00:22:32] If the would be school shooter knows that there are armed people in the school they're probably going to
[00:22:39] figure out a different target.
[00:22:45] So the police officers enter the school they get shot at.
[00:22:49] That receive grazing wounds they retreat.
[00:22:59] So this is a tough one to with what I know about you know they only were into
[00:23:08] their retreat and that they that they received fire.
[00:23:12] This could mean a bunch of different things.
[00:23:14] This could mean full automatic fire that is at the shooting at the door that they're trying to get through.
[00:23:24] And if that's the case and they proceed and they're just all going to die.
[00:23:27] And now they can't help.
[00:23:31] Or is it some rounds came and they immediately retreated? I don't know. I don't know what happened there.
[00:23:38] I do know this.
[00:23:44] When you're getting shot at you now have information.
[00:23:50] You have very pertinent information.
[00:23:54] You know the general location.
[00:23:57] If you're taking rounds you you know where they're you know at least a little bit where they're coming from.
[00:24:03] So now we can start to formulate some kind of a plan.
[00:24:05] You also know that you've got a high threat scenario and you've got children in there.
[00:24:10] Now you can't just put down cover fire and shoot back at a person in the school because there's a bunch of kids.
[00:24:14] And you can get a friendly fire scenario happening.
[00:24:18] So you can't just lay down cover fire like you would over in a you know foreign country in a war.
[00:24:27] But you know where the bad guy is generally speaking.
[00:24:31] You know at least the door that you're at he has covered which tells you what.
[00:24:37] There's other doors that he may not have covered.
[00:24:41] Meaning other doors where he may not be able to engage.
[00:24:45] So we've tried one entry and we have now an information that we can't get in there.
[00:24:50] So now what are we going to do find another place to go?
[00:25:02] Going back to the timeline here.
[00:25:05] Pete Eradondo the chief of the school districts police department also arrives at the scene around this time.
[00:25:12] He does not have his radios.
[00:25:13] Eradondo wanted both hands on his gun if he encountered the shooter and believed the radios would have slowed him down.
[00:25:22] His attorney said.
[00:25:27] Now that's.
[00:25:34] This is not this is not even a thing.
[00:25:36] It's not even a this is not even a remotely.
[00:25:45] Square to a concept in anyway.
[00:25:47] What the radio going in.
[00:25:49] Get going.
[00:25:50] A the radio told you down.
[00:25:53] B both hands on your gun.
[00:25:55] I mean you don't carry your radio in your hand while you're shooting.
[00:25:59] You have you have your radio.
[00:26:02] You have a mic to to talk into if you need to.
[00:26:11] You going into a situation like this.
[00:26:15] Communication during an event like this is beyond critical.
[00:26:20] There's beyond critical, especially if you're the chief.
[00:26:25] If you're overall in charge of what's happening.
[00:26:28] You are the one person that absolutely needs a radio and you're at so does everybody else.
[00:26:36] Now you don't always sometimes you don't always have every single person with a radio.
[00:26:40] But if you're overall in charge, you're the one that's going to be communicating, receiving
[00:26:45] communications, giving directions.
[00:26:48] You're the one that's supposed to get an overall concept of what's happening.
[00:26:52] Now this is an insane lack of judgment.
[00:27:01] And I would love to pull the thread on this and figure out what actually happened.
[00:27:08] My guess is some the chief didn't look in his car, see his radio and go, you know what?
[00:27:14] I'm going to leave my radio here.
[00:27:18] My guess is that's not what happened.
[00:27:20] That might be what the lawyer's saying.
[00:27:22] As a rationalization well, he thought he might need it.
[00:27:26] He thought it might slow him down and thought that he want to have both hands on his guns.
[00:27:32] On his gun.
[00:27:34] That might be a post-operation rationalization.
[00:27:38] Excuse my guess is that in the panic of the situation,
[00:27:44] he didn't think about it for God.
[00:27:50] By the way, this points to an equally insane lack of training.
[00:27:56] Because no one ever in any kind of scenario ever where more than one person is acting
[00:28:02] in different parts of a team decides not to bring a radio.
[00:28:05] That's not a decision that anyone is going to make.
[00:28:07] I would grab my radio before, if I was in charge, I'd grab my radio before I grab my weapon.
[00:28:15] How you like that?
[00:28:22] So to be in charge and to decide not to bring your radio is
[00:28:28] complete not a failure.
[00:28:29] And you're obviously in some things where they ran some scenarios.
[00:28:31] Like this, the training, if you train one time doing this and you're in charge,
[00:28:40] you'll say damn, I better make sure I have good communications with my team.
[00:28:44] If you do this one time, if you approach a hostile target where there's bad guys in there,
[00:28:51] one time, no hostages, no children, just one bad guy you put him in a building and you have
[00:28:56] you and one other person, you'll make that radio an absolute priority.
[00:29:10] One time, now you take a situation where you've got an active shooter and there's a bunch of kids
[00:29:14] and you've got different units coming in from different places, you're gone off freaking
[00:29:19] need a radio and you would know that if you had any training whatsoever.
[00:29:30] Here's the thing, it takes practice and I know this sounds crazy because everyone's
[00:29:34] look, everyone's on on chair quarterback and everyone can sit there and look, of course, I would
[00:29:39] brought my radio, I'm telling you, I'm telling you this, it takes practice to know this.
[00:29:44] As obvious as it seems to everyone right now, it takes practice, you hear kids screaming,
[00:29:50] you hear gunshots going off, you're the person in charge, you're kind of panic and you go.
[00:29:56] You haven't been trained to the proper level and you go in there with a radio.
[00:30:04] So it's again reflects bad training.
[00:30:07] And at this point, former officers, including a deputy with the county sheriff's office, also
[00:30:16] enter the school at this time. So now we have seven police there against one and again,
[00:30:21] I'm going to need to see the breakdown detail of the building itself of where people entered,
[00:30:26] but you've got more people in the school now. And by the way, by my numbers, that seven police
[00:30:32] against one shooter and I like those odds. Seven against one I like. 1137 gunman fires 16 more rounds.
[00:30:49] Again, you have a school with little kids in it and the gunman is shooting. What that means is you go.
[00:31:04] That's what that means. Let me refer to that. If you didn't already get the signal
[00:31:10] that there's a freaking gunman in a school and you haven't done everything you can to get in there
[00:31:17] and now that gunman is shooting again, that's another blaring signal to get your ass in there.
[00:31:30] And by the way, these are not, these are lessons that have been learned. When you look
[00:31:35] what happened at Column by and they came up with the same kind of conclusions, there was too much
[00:31:39] hesitation, there's too much waiting. When you hear this stuff happening, you have to take action.
[00:31:49] This is exactly the type of scenario where when I start with teaching the young seals,
[00:31:55] I had to teach them to be default aggressive. This is the exact kind of scenario. The problem's not
[00:32:00] going to solve itself. You have to go and solve it. That's what you have to do. And the reason that I
[00:32:05] had to teach them to be aggressive and have that be their default motives because when things like
[00:32:11] this happen, people's natural mode isn't to take action. For many people, their natural mode is,
[00:32:17] oh, I don't know what's happening. I'm going to wait to try and figure out what's happening. That's what
[00:32:22] they're instinct is. And we have to train that instinct out of many people, not all people.
[00:32:29] Some people, you actually have to train in the other direction. Some people have to say, hey,
[00:32:32] hold on a second, you have no idea what's happening. Don't go running in there. Most people,
[00:32:37] you have to train, hey, if it's going on and you can't tell what's happening, you need to get
[00:32:42] aggressive and figure out what's happening. You need to take action.
[00:32:50] And in a situation like this, we're now you have a gunman in the school. It's still shooting.
[00:32:54] It is time without question to do whatever you need to do to get in there. Now at 143 AM,
[00:33:08] Rob Elementary and Yvalday Police Post on Facebook, they announced that the school is under
[00:33:17] lockdown status to do gunshots in the area. By the way, this is like 150 rounds have been fired. The
[00:33:24] students and staff are safe in the building. The building is secure in a lockdown status. School
[00:33:28] officials say in an announcement. So there's no emergency communication in the building.
[00:33:38] And what I mean by that, there's no, there's no
[00:33:40] proword. So in the military, you have something called a proword, which is one word that means
[00:33:49] something that means a whole scenario is taking place. So if I'm out on an operation and we start
[00:34:00] taking fire heavy fire from the target building and we have an entered the target yet,
[00:34:05] I have one word that I can say. And when I say that one word, everybody knows what to do.
[00:34:13] Everyone knows that there's no friendlies in the building that the target building is shooting
[00:34:17] heavy fire at us. I can say one word and everybody knows what to do.
[00:34:21] If we have people in the target building, we start taking fire. I have one word I can say and everybody
[00:34:26] knows what to do. So there's a breakdown of communication here because no one has put out,
[00:34:33] hey, there's a freaking shooter in our school that's gunning people down.
[00:34:40] No one knows this. So no one knows what's happening. So as you think through these scenarios,
[00:34:49] you need to come up with some pro words so that everyone understands what's happening.
[00:34:55] At the same time, the Valdi Police Department posts on Facebook, large police presence at
[00:35:00] Rob Elementary, we ask the public to avoid the area. So there's not communication between the
[00:35:07] school and the police. Do are there police radios in the school?
[00:35:14] That seems like a really obvious question, but does the school have the ability to
[00:35:23] communicate with the police directly through radios? Because this is not a very hard thing to figure out.
[00:35:32] It's not a very costly thing to figure out.
[00:35:40] 1144 AM, the police officers are inside. Police with with the city of Uvaldi are and the school district
[00:35:52] are inside the school. This is 1144. Uvaldi police officers enter the building where the shooter is
[00:35:58] from the north entrance. They hear gunfire, our shot at, move back and get cover.
[00:36:10] Again, if you're getting shot at, you now have a general idea of where the shooter is.
[00:36:15] If you have a general idea where the shooter is, then it's time to maneuver. It's time to flank.
[00:36:25] A shooter can only cover so many different directions at the same time.
[00:36:30] And how do I know that? Because I've been on both sides of those scenarios.
[00:36:37] When you train properly, you not only act as the good guys, you spend time as a bad guy.
[00:36:49] So you start to realize what works and what doesn't work.
[00:36:55] That's the benefit of training.
[00:36:56] Back to the document. Around this time, Eradondo and another Uvaldi police officer enter the building
[00:37:09] through the south entrance. Eradondo witnesses the gunfire. He then checks the door to the
[00:37:15] classroom that the shooter is in finding it locked. He uses his cell phone to call for squad teams,
[00:37:20] snipers, extrication tools, and keys to the classrooms.
[00:37:30] This is at 11.44. So all this is taking place for almost over 20 minutes. This has been going on.
[00:37:41] And only now we're getting a call for squad team snipers, breaching tools.
[00:37:46] And it's on the cell phone. How why are we making calls on a cell phone?
[00:37:57] Why is that happening?
[00:38:01] We have radios. There's a reason you have radios direct communication.
[00:38:06] In Centanius immediate direct communication to a whole net of people.
[00:38:10] Oh, that's right. Well, he doesn't have his radios.
[00:38:16] So he's making cell phone calls.
[00:38:27] It says a niche. There's a quote in here.
[00:38:30] Initial officers are there and receive gunfire. Therefore, do not make entry.
[00:38:34] Officers call everyone in the area for additional resources. Tactical teams, equipment, specialty
[00:38:41] equipment, body armor, precision riflemen, and negotiators. They're evacuating students and teachers
[00:38:47] during this time. And this is from Victor Escalon, a DPS official during a press conference on May 26.
[00:38:54] From the very beginning of this whole thing, you clearly have an active shooter that needs to
[00:39:05] be hunted down and killed. That's completely evident from the first moments.
[00:39:14] As soon as a car crashes and two guys go to help and they and he gets shot at,
[00:39:19] or those two guys get shot at by someone who then maneuvers towards a school,
[00:39:23] this is an active shooter situation and someone needs to hunt this guy down and kill him.
[00:39:30] And that's the mode that needs to be gone into instantaneously.
[00:39:35] And there's going to be risk.
[00:39:42] There's going to be risk when you're going up against someone with a gun.
[00:39:45] There's a risk that you're going to die. And that's what we in the military and law enforcement
[00:39:51] sign up for. And we have to think through that actually and you have to train for that.
[00:39:58] And the first time that you think about getting shot and the probability that you get shot
[00:40:03] shouldn't be in an actual gunfight. This shouldn't be the first time this is going through your head.
[00:40:10] You should do training and you need to do training, where you understand what you're going to
[00:40:15] be put up against and you should understand what that feels like and you should either get over it
[00:40:21] and accept that as part of your job or you should get a different job.
[00:40:37] 1148. There's an officers' wife is shot.
[00:40:43] So you've got the CISD police officer, Ruben Ruiz, can be heard telling other officers as he arrives
[00:40:52] inside the school that his wife, even Morrellis, has been shot.
[00:40:57] So you look at this woman, the school teacher just seemed like an amazing human.
[00:41:14] She's got pictures, there's pictures of her. She's outdoors, she's enjoying life, she's out
[00:41:19] running, she's hiking, she's doing Spartan races, she's doing CrossFit, she's just seems like an awesome woman
[00:41:28] and had a daughter with Ruben Ruiz. So he gets word that she shot.
[00:41:41] 1151 AM, Mor police arrive, more law enforcement officials arrive at the scene again.
[00:41:48] So what are we doing at this point? Who is running things at this point in time?
[00:41:56] Now you got 1520 law enforcement officers, on scene and you got one bad guy.
[00:42:07] That's a fight we can win all day long. All day long. We're going to win and we might take some casualties
[00:42:14] but we can win that fight all day long. 1154 AM, there's an onlooker starts filming.
[00:42:32] 21 minutes after the shooter enters the school and onlooker streams a live video showing
[00:42:38] parents begging police to enter the school. Now this is very difficult to watch. This is actually
[00:42:49] sickening to watch. There are parents that are going crazy with frustration. They want to help their kids.
[00:42:59] And in some of these videos, you can see that the parents are being held back by officers
[00:43:05] with long guns, with rifles, with assault rifles. And what they're doing is keeping the parents at bay.
[00:43:23] Now here's what's difficult to understand. Most likely, I can just about guarantee these officers
[00:43:29] that are doing this have no idea what's going on. They probably think they're doing the right
[00:43:37] thing, which is, hey, there's an active shooter in there. My teammates are in there killing this
[00:43:42] guy, so I need to make sure these civilians stay safe. That's what they're thinking. And why are they
[00:43:47] thinking that? Because no one in this whole scenario is detached and connecting the pieces,
[00:43:52] which is what needs to happen when this kind of thing goes down. Someone has got to take a step
[00:44:00] back and piece together what's happening and put together a plan.
[00:44:08] So these parents, you watch these parents, they actually are somewhat detached. The parents are
[00:44:14] kind of detached because they can see that there's why is the shooting continuing? Why is this happening?
[00:44:29] 1203, please continue to arrive and a student calls 911 from inside a student calls 911 from
[00:44:36] room 112 for a minute and 23 seconds and identifies herself in a whisper. Meanwhile, as many as 19
[00:44:44] officers are positioned in the school's hallway, 19 officers. And now we know that we got kids in their
[00:44:52] alive and you have 19 officers. 1210, the student calls back. Student calls 911 again and says
[00:45:06] multiple people are dead. So now you know for sure, the shooter is a psychopath that needs to be stopped.
[00:45:14] That's what you know. 1213 PM, student calls 911 again. Student calls a third time.
[00:45:30] The 40s have not expanded on our comments during this call. 1215 Border Patrol Tactical
[00:45:35] Unit arrives. Border Patrol Tactical Unit members carrying shields arrive.
[00:45:42] And she looked, ballistic shields are a great, an awesome tool to have. For sure, they're great.
[00:45:55] We're not waiting for this if there's kids that are going to be killed when I wait and for shields to show up.
[00:46:05] 1216 PM, student calls 911 once again. The student calls 911 again saying eight or nine
[00:46:11] students are alive. So now we know we got live kids in there and we got more than enough people to
[00:46:21] to make this happen. 1217 oddly enough the school announced there's an active shooter on campus.
[00:46:28] I mean, what's happening in our overall, from an overall leadership perspective between the
[00:46:40] school and the police when we have at 1217 as there's dead children, dead teachers and now we're
[00:46:48] announcing that we have an active shooter on campus. The all-lookers, the parents are now begging for action.
[00:47:00] Here's a little pull out. It's at some point during the standoff, all-lookers beg police to charge
[00:47:04] the school according to the Associated Press. Parents try to break windows and are not allowed
[00:47:10] to immediately be reunited with their children. Again, there's a video of this. It's
[00:47:14] sickening to watch. There's parents yelling out, what are you doing? Get inside the building. Go protect the kids.
[00:47:27] And there's a one mom. One mom, Angelie Rose Gomez. She gets cuffed. She gets cuffed for
[00:47:40] quote, intervening with an active investigation. And I can't even give this woman enough props and
[00:47:49] praise. She, she like pretended to calm down so that they would release her once they released her.
[00:47:59] She distanced herself from the crowd, got away from like all the hype and all the mania. And then she
[00:48:04] jumped the fence, went in and got her to kids out. Meanwhile, she said that other fathers
[00:48:14] got tackled, pepper sprayed and tays. Again, somebody has to take a step back and get
[00:48:34] control the situation and no one did that here. And is there a chance that someone in this group
[00:48:40] of people, one of these police officers, happens to be a really good leader and happens to understand
[00:48:45] what to do in dynamic situations and happens to have the authority and the leadership skill to get
[00:48:53] control of the situation? Is there a chance that someone might have that? There's a chance,
[00:48:58] there's also a chance that no one has that. And that's why you have to train people so that they
[00:49:01] can perform in these situations. And by the way, the training is also screening to see what kind of
[00:49:07] personality people have. And see what kind of shortfalls they have as leaders. And some people
[00:49:11] don't have the cognitive capacity to make these decisions. And some people don't have the
[00:49:17] the cognitive capacity to take a step back. And some people don't have the wherewithal
[00:49:22] to press through in tough scenarios. And so as leaders, we need to know who those people are.
[00:49:38] This mom, Miss Gomez, Miss Gomez, she is that type of person to take action, to be default
[00:49:47] aggressive, get things solved. She was detached enough emotionally to realize she had to get away from
[00:49:53] the mob, get to a position where she can maneuver in. She was able to do this.
[00:49:59] Some people have that natural ability. Some people don't. And I'm going to get to this in a little
[00:50:03] bit. There's also training that has to be overcome. Sometimes people fall into training habits that
[00:50:10] aren't good. So we have to train to the point that we recognize when what we've been trained to do
[00:50:18] isn't working. 12. 19. PM. Another student calls 911 from from room 11. Hangs up when another
[00:50:33] student tells her to 12. 21. Gunman fires again. Authorities say he was believed to be at the
[00:50:43] classrooms door. On a 911 call from a student three gunshots can be heard. This is over and over again.
[00:50:54] Then things that would mean to me as a tactical leader we go right now. There's time after time,
[00:51:04] after time, after time. There's execute criteria. A room full of kids. There's a guy in there
[00:51:14] is shooting. You go. There's not a debate. You go. That's what you do. You go. You go through the windows.
[00:51:21] You breach the doors. You do whatever you got to do to get in there. That's what you do.
[00:51:33] 12. 36. Student in room 11. Calls back again. Same student calls back for 21 seconds
[00:51:38] and is told to stay on the line quietly. 12.43 gunman shoots the door. The student tells 9.11 that
[00:51:47] the gunman shot the door. Okay. There's another execute criteria.
[00:51:56] And you do what you have to do to get in there. Windows. You put ladders up to the windows. You crash.
[00:52:03] You crash through those windows. You crash a vehicle into the windows. You shoot the door off the hinges.
[00:52:12] That's what you do. 12.46. I can hear the police next door. Student called 9.11. 12.46.
[00:52:27] Eradando gives the approval to enter. If you're all ready to do it, you do it. He says according
[00:52:35] to a transcript of police body cam footage. 12.46. 12.46. Over an hour.
[00:52:54] 12.47. 911 call from a student. Please send police now. 12.50. Border Patrol Tactical Unit Officer
[00:53:19] Breach is the room and uses a janitor's keys and kills the gunman.
[00:53:28] And I don't have any details on how that actually happened yet.
[00:53:36] I know Bortak people, which is the Border Patrol Tactical Unit Bortak. I know them. I've actually
[00:53:42] worked with them a little bit. I've got some reports that they disobeyed orders. People were telling
[00:53:49] them not to enter and they did it. Anyways, good on them. But what I've been saying this whole time,
[00:53:58] go in, go in, go in, go in. And you think to yourself, well, if you go in or you're going to get
[00:54:05] shot, if you go in, is this going to happen? You don't know. But look what happens when these guys
[00:54:09] finally go in. They go in there and they kill the guy. That's what happens. You got to go on offense.
[00:54:25] 12.51. Children are moved out of the room.
[00:54:29] 12.51. 106 police announced the shooter is in custody because the Border Patrol and they're
[00:54:43] killed them. And then you vowed the police announced on Facebook that the shooter is in custody
[00:54:52] authorities recanted that information later. So, there you have it. What can we learn from this?
[00:55:11] And again, at this point in time, I'm focused on what could we learn from this tactical situation
[00:55:16] that unfolded? What can we learn from it? I know there's a whole bunch of a whole slew of other topics
[00:55:25] to talk about. And those are happening on a massive level. And those will continue to happen.
[00:55:34] But as an area that I actually know a decent amount about is this. So that's what I'm talking about.
[00:55:42] And first of all, and I've been saying this for years, police need more training.
[00:55:52] Police 20% of time, 20% of working hours for police should be spent training.
[00:56:03] That's what should happen. That's what needs to happen. And listen, you think, oh,
[00:56:08] that that there's now going to be less people out on patrol, less police out on patrol?
[00:56:12] They're their effectiveness will more than make up for the fact that there's less police on patrol.
[00:56:18] Who would you rather if you were in a hostage situation with some crazy person in your house?
[00:56:23] Who would you rather have show up 10 untrained people or 8 highly trained people?
[00:56:29] And if you're not sure about that, let me tell you because I guarantee you all day long, I'll
[00:56:33] take 8 highly trained people over 10 untrained people all day. All day.
[00:56:46] And I'll tell you, I am now, I've started to talk to some organizations
[00:56:55] to see how echelon front my company can help do this on a national level. What should this training
[00:57:01] consist of? What are we training? Police in?
[00:57:05] Well, combatives for one thing, shooting, breaching. First aid trauma.
[00:57:13] Deescalation. And anybody that's listening that doesn't know much about the police,
[00:57:19] you might think they do all this stuff all the time. They don't. They don't do this all the time.
[00:57:26] They barely get to shoot. I bet you 99% of police have very limited training if any in breaching
[00:57:34] and how to breach a door with a shot gun.
[00:57:41] Combatives, barely any. Barely any training. Close quarters combat, room clearing.
[00:57:49] Urban combat clearance. How do you handle an active shooter? How do you handle a barricade
[00:57:58] shooter? And then you've got to run scenarios. You've got to put people into these situations.
[00:58:07] You've got to get a simulation or some kind of round that can be fired at other people during training.
[00:58:17] You need assets. You need role players so that people get used to it.
[00:58:27] And you absolutely get better. This is exactly what I did for a living.
[00:58:34] Was trained young seals so that they understand what to do in these types of situations. And you
[00:58:41] can watch and see them learn and get better. And over time, they eventually get to a point where
[00:58:48] they know exactly what to do. Yeah, they learn about the basic fundamental principles.
[00:59:00] Cover and move simple. Prioritize next to your decentralized command. They're going to learn about those
[00:59:03] things. They're going to learn about decentralized command, which means when I show up and there's
[00:59:07] something going on and I'm the junior guy, but I'm the first person there. I can make things happen.
[00:59:11] I can make decisions. I know what the priorities are. That's what they learn.
[00:59:20] They learn how to detach. You've heard me say someone's got to take a step back and figure out
[00:59:24] what's happening broadly. Well, that's what people learn when you run them through the appropriate
[00:59:29] training. They learn how to communicate. They learn the importance of communications. They learn
[00:59:33] not to go into dynamic scenarios without a radio so they can communicate with the rest of their troops.
[00:59:41] This so much of this whole thing was people not seeing the big picture. No one assembled
[00:59:49] the entire scene to understand what was happening. And therefore no one made the broad call that
[00:59:55] needed to be made, which is get in there. Get in there. We're going. And this does take training.
[01:00:10] It does take training. Now it doesn't take training if you're a parent and your kids in there.
[01:00:13] That doesn't take any training. That's instinct. And I'll talk a little bit about that.
[01:00:19] But it takes training. I had experience seals. I would have experience seals that would fail
[01:00:25] to take action when they needed to. And we'd have to have them do that training again. And maybe
[01:00:29] again, and maybe again, until they realize that when they don't take action, everything's going to fall apart.
[01:00:37] So even seals would have a hard time in some cases figuring these things out.
[01:00:41] Now, like I said, the parents that were there, they were detached. And maybe not emotionally
[01:00:56] because they're they're obviously horrified by what's going on. But some of the parents you can
[01:01:03] go watch the videos, they're making matter of fact statements about what was going on.
[01:01:07] They're saying there's kids in there. They're shooting going on.
[01:01:16] Now to this idea of instinct, which I mentioned, instinct versus methodology versus instinct.
[01:01:23] Okay, you have an instinct of what to do. And in some cases, you need to get trained against that
[01:01:30] instinct. It's just like in jujitsu. There's certain things where your instinct is wrong.
[01:01:39] And so it takes some training to teach you to overcome your instinct.
[01:01:48] To learn a methodology that's superior to the instinct. And there are times when the methodology
[01:01:56] is wrong and the instinct is correct. What do I mean by that? I got a story about JP to Nell,
[01:02:02] JP to Nell. One of my guys in my last deployment to Iraq. And outstanding guy, seal,
[01:02:13] sniper, point man, outstanding guy. And when we first started working together, we were out in the desert.
[01:02:19] And we're doing a patrol out in the desert. And the patrol stopped. And I'm looking at JP.
[01:02:27] And JP standing out in the open. He's standing out in the open. Now we're out in the desert,
[01:02:33] but it's not a barren desert. There's rocks and shrubs and micro-terrain features. And we stop our
[01:02:40] patrol and JP standing out in the open. And I walk over to him. And I said, hey, JP, if you were 10 years
[01:02:48] old right now and we were playing war, where would you be standing? And he pointed over to a little
[01:02:56] bush with some rocks rounded with a little terrain to hide behind. And he said, right over there.
[01:03:01] And I said, let your 10s 10 year old instinct. Let it come to life. Let it do its job. That's where you
[01:03:09] should be. I know the standard operating procedure is when the patrol stops. You set down
[01:03:14] a near position in your field of fire. You halt and you stay there. But if you can move six yards
[01:03:20] and have good-covering concealment, that's what you should do. So sometimes people train to a point
[01:03:27] like these police officers probably and I've heard some talk about this. Hey, it's a barricaded
[01:03:33] shooter, which means we he's going to be staying there and we should negotiate. So they got in this
[01:03:40] mode of well-barricaded shooter. We should just negotiate with them. The reality of the situation
[01:03:49] it wasn't barricaded shooter. He was moving around. He was still shooting the entire time.
[01:03:54] That's not a barricaded shooter that's decided to hold up and negotiate for some kind of ransom.
[01:03:59] Not at all. They got stuck in that mode.
[01:04:03] What needed to happen was action. A methodical entry, a perfect entry into the building.
[01:04:13] If you were to plot out the perfect close quarters combat operation for this school and how many
[01:04:20] people you would need and what methodology you would move for the building and what type of breaches
[01:04:24] you would use on the doors and which would be most efficient. All that stuff goes out the window
[01:04:28] when there's an active shooter in the room with a bunch of kids, your instinct needs to be to get in there
[01:04:35] and some of those parents had that instinct. Yelling, get into the building.
[01:04:43] But the training methodology had boxed these guys in mentally. Where they thought, oh well, we don't
[01:04:48] have shields. And this is a speculating at this point. But oh, if we don't have ballistic shields, we
[01:04:55] shouldn't go in there. Hey, we were taught not to go into a shooter situation, an active shooter
[01:05:01] situation without ballistic shields. We're waiting for the ballistic shields. No, that's the methodology
[01:05:06] been talked. It's not working right now. What about the windows? Walking up to the windows, smashing
[01:05:14] a window, shooting through the window. You can do that throwing crash grenades through the windows.
[01:05:23] Put 10 crash grenades through the windows on this guy. There's a bunch of different things that
[01:05:34] if you do what you would naturally do in a situation, you're probably right.
[01:05:43] So what you have to do is you're going to have instinct. You're going to have a natural instinct.
[01:05:46] The instinct could be wrong. The instinct could be right.
[01:05:49] I mean, here's an instinct. What's something shooting? I mean, I'm going to run away.
[01:05:54] And I'm not going to go back. So police officers have to overcome that instinct to go and stay
[01:05:59] and maneuver towards fire. That's overcoming their natural instinct.
[01:06:05] But there's sometimes where the methodology is wrong. And so you have to be good enough to overcome
[01:06:11] your methodology and go if you're instincts sometimes.
[01:06:14] Are you, it's another thing I used to say to these young seals.
[01:06:22] If you, I'd say, hey, if you were going to go in that room right now and I was in there and you
[01:06:27] were 10 years old and I was 10 years old and I had a squirt gun and you had a squirt gun.
[01:06:32] And you were going to enter this room. How would you do it? And they'd show me.
[01:06:36] And I'd say, doesn't that make more sense than what you just did and they'd say, yeah, it does.
[01:06:44] But they would follow some standard operating procedures that didn't make sense in a particular room.
[01:06:49] But they would do what they were taught to do even though it didn't make sense.
[01:06:55] And the ability to decide whether your instinct is right or wrong,
[01:07:00] you get that ability by being able to take a step back and assess. And the way you get that ability
[01:07:05] to take a step back and assess is through training.
[01:07:13] And it takes time. And that's why I use that term, that that idea of 20% of time for police officers
[01:07:22] should be spent training. And you're going to end up with infinitely more qualified and prepared police.
[01:07:30] There was a fighting methodology, a combatives methodology, a system that was being used in the
[01:07:43] seal teams. And it was ineffective. It was ineffective system. But one of the reasons that it was
[01:07:51] argued to be a good system was because there was a one week course of instruction of this fighting
[01:07:59] methodology that if you took this one week course of instruction, then you were qualified
[01:08:06] and allegedly prepared for combat. Well, you can't learn to fight one week. There's not going to
[01:08:13] happen. You can't learn good combatives skills in one week. And so I was bringing up to my chain of command.
[01:08:22] Hey, this combative system is ineffective. We should use some kind of a more mixed martial arts
[01:08:30] combination of jujitsu wrestling boxing, mojitai using our weapons in those scenarios.
[01:08:37] And one of the arguments that I got against that idea was that all that stuff takes years to learn.
[01:08:44] It takes years to learn this stuff. This stuff we can teach people in a week.
[01:08:47] Well, you know what I said to that? I said, well, we're in the damn teams for 20 years.
[01:08:53] Let people get good. You shouldn't tell someone that after a week of training, they're going to be good
[01:08:57] to go. They're not training has to happen all the time. And by the way, eventually, we do have a great
[01:09:07] jujitsu wrestling boxing mojitai based combative system in the seal teams,
[01:09:13] which is you also utilize your weapons, you utilize your gear, but it's based in these things that work.
[01:09:21] And it takes time to get good at. No one says, oh, you've been through one week course. You can handle
[01:09:25] yourself now because we know that that's not true. So it comes down to training. And there's a look.
[01:09:38] Are there a bunch of other factors, a bunch of other things that we can address? Yes,
[01:09:42] there are absolutely are. There are a bunch of other things to talk about.
[01:09:49] But like I said, this is something that I know and something that I understand training people
[01:09:53] for stressful, dynamic, dangerous situations. And that's what we need to do with our law enforcement.
[01:10:00] We need to train them properly. Because we owe it to them. We owe it to our police and law
[01:10:10] enforcement to train them properly. We owe it to the law abiding citizens of this country.
[01:10:19] And of course, we owe it to the innocent children.
[01:10:23] They're just trying to get their freaking education in school. So that's my initial take on this scenario.
[01:10:44] Again, I talked about some of the other factors with their Cooper on our unraveling podcast.
[01:11:00] But I wonder who dressed this here and try and get this word out.
[01:11:03] With that Equitrals. Yes. You know, like, let's have some of these things happen. You hear
[01:11:21] of all these solutions. On the cards and schools, gun control laws. Like, you know,
[01:11:28] everyone has their take. What do you think are some of the solutions that off the top of your head
[01:11:34] that are not practical or doable or probably wouldn't be affected that you've heard?
[01:11:41] There's a whole slew of things going on. And there's many facets that lead to this
[01:11:48] situation. As far as I don't really think too much about,
[01:11:52] hey, what wouldn't work. And one of the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is this is what
[01:11:58] I know will help in a situation like this. If you train people properly that'll be able to handle these
[01:12:02] situations, if you could snap your fingers and have all the schools, you know, be totally safe.
[01:12:08] Of course, of course, we'll take that all day long. We don't get to operate in fantasy world.
[01:12:14] There's crazy mentally disturbed people out there. And if you haven't listened to that podcast,
[01:12:21] I did with Darrell, one of the most shocking statistics that come out came out from it was
[01:12:28] in 1955. There were 340 inpatient beds for every 100,000 people in America. That
[01:12:37] needed mental health help. 340 beds forever every 100,000 citizens. Those beds were dedicated
[01:12:48] for mental health. They had that many available available. They were just not necessarily taken up,
[01:12:55] just available. So out of every 100,000 people, there's 370 inpatient mental health beds available
[01:13:03] in mental health facilities. In 2007, there was 17. Yeah, 17. So that's a 95% reduction in the amount
[01:13:20] of available mental health facilities for people that need help. And by the way, during this time,
[01:13:29] we've added all kinds of other crazy things into the mix with drugs, legal drugs, illegal drugs,
[01:13:38] prescription drugs, all kinds of media violence, whether it's social media, whether it's violent movies,
[01:13:48] whether it's violent videos, all that's added into the mix. The SSRIs, the isolation of
[01:13:57] of being on social media in the first place, the breakdown of the family structure, like all
[01:14:03] these things are happening. You throw those all those things into the mix and then you have less
[01:14:09] mental health available. That's where you end up. It's one of the things that you end up.
[01:14:17] So I don't know if the necessarily answered your question about what would not help.
[01:14:22] I try and look at what can we actually do immediately to try and start getting people in a
[01:14:29] better situation, getting these things freaking moving in the right direction. Yeah, yeah, I was thinking
[01:14:35] because I remember you said something about like you were an advocate of like having an
[01:14:39] armed guard at the school, right? Where they're retired military or this was a while ago.
[01:14:44] And then I remember hearing the option of training teachers or army in the teachers, that's
[01:14:52] what it was. So how do you feel about army teachers? It's the same thing. You need to train the teachers.
[01:15:04] Are you going to train the teachers? Because you got to train the teachers. Which,
[01:15:08] can you train the teachers? Yes, you can. You can train some of them. Someone that want to get
[01:15:11] trained. You know, the armed guard thing, my mom was a school principal. And, and then she was
[01:15:17] a superintendent of schools. And I remember when these school shootings started happening,
[01:15:22] I was immediately like, hey, you should put there should be two dudes sitting in a closet,
[01:15:30] you know, with video cameras, closer to television cameras, they're watching what's going on.
[01:15:35] And if anything ever happens, they come out and they kill bad guy. I wish I would have been
[01:15:39] super vocal about it. Because some of these things would have been stopped a lot quicker.
[01:15:47] And then like I said, there's some people that say, well, what kind of world are we living
[01:15:52] into when we need to? Let me reprise that because I'm using a horrible voice. Some people say,
[01:15:56] hey, what kind of world are we living in? Where we have to put armed guards in a school?
[01:16:01] I'll tell you the world that we created. The world that we created, you need to have armed
[01:16:06] guards in school because we've got some serious issues, some serious cultural and societal issues
[01:16:15] that makes an 18 year old kid want to get a machine gun and go into a freaking school and start killing
[01:16:22] kids. That's what's that's why. So if you say to me, what kind of a world are we living in? Where
[01:16:32] we need to put armed guards in schools? I will say the United States of America. Do I like it?
[01:16:39] Do I like the fact that we have to do that? No. Do I like the fact that I got a, you know,
[01:16:46] wear a seat belt when I drive a car? Because I might crash. I don't really like it, but I'm going to do it.
[01:16:54] I remember I was in high school when they were security there. They didn't have. They
[01:16:59] weren't armed that I knew of, but I feel like granted this is high school, so I'll let me
[01:17:03] just go a little bit different. And I'm thinking back if they were armed, I don't think that would
[01:17:10] have made that much of a difference. If they were like prison guards, like, you know, ordering
[01:17:16] to actually use security guards are pretty mean too to everybody. They were like hosts, you know,
[01:17:20] I'd envision it where they should be nice, like almost like, nice teachers almost kind of a
[01:17:26] thing like shapper on, you know, sometimes teachers get like yard duty. That's what they call
[01:17:30] the school where they got in monitors. It was awesome. No, it's like, well, I'm tired. It's so
[01:17:39] elementary school teaches up yard duty, right, certain ones. And basically they just got
[01:17:43] sight and recess and just make sure no one acts up or whatever. And no one really acts. Yeah.
[01:17:47] Yeah. So what you're talking about is people that are people that are employed at the school
[01:17:51] to keep the students in check. Yes. There's a difference between someone that's at school to keep
[01:17:55] the students in check and someone that's at school to prevent someone from coming to harm
[01:17:58] the students. Yeah. So there's a two different people you'd be looking for. Yes. But in in high school,
[01:18:03] one thing with the security, that's what these, and actually there were ladies, two of them.
[01:18:07] And they were there. Yes. For to keep people in check in all capacities. But what I'm saying is
[01:18:14] maybe one or two levels more advanced, we'll say, is instead of two ladies with just radios,
[01:18:22] they were retired military or guys with guns. Not necessarily over with radios. But their presence is
[01:18:32] kind of known or whatever. It's not intimidating. It's more of a host kind of scenario.
[01:18:37] Like someone who's on the kids side kind of a thing, more so than someone with their eagle eyes open
[01:18:43] for any trouble, that kind of thing. Even though that is what they're doing, that's not their
[01:18:47] presence. That's not what it feels like. Yeah. You need to be careful with that. If you're going to
[01:18:52] have someone that's going to be doing security, they should be doing security. Look, can someone be
[01:18:56] dual rolled? Sure. But if you're going to put someone on security, like their purpose is security,
[01:19:02] you don't want them breaking up fights over potato chips in the school yard. You know what I'm saying?
[01:19:06] Yeah. You want them to be focused on what they're supposed to be focused on.
[01:19:09] The good, is it smart to have people that are dual trained? Sure. But someone has to be,
[01:19:15] if you put someone on security for the purpose of being on security, they should be on security.
[01:19:19] Now, like you said, and like I said, this doesn't mean they need to be walking around with body
[01:19:23] armor, visible body armor, and a weapon, and a salt rifle like posted up. They don't need to be
[01:19:31] like that. But they, I mean, they could literally be sitting in a central location and a closet with
[01:19:38] closed circuit TVs, and when something like this happens, they know what to do. I remember the
[01:19:45] the army, the teachers, um, option, and I remember, uh, kind of talking to some of our friends
[01:19:52] that are actual teachers, and it kind of put things into perspective, because at first I was like,
[01:19:56] yeah, that makes sense. You know, it's not like, you know, give me just a little bit of training,
[01:20:00] whatever. But at least it's one more good guy in the field, you know, with, you know, who's armed
[01:20:04] in can protect, but then I thought about after talking to some of the teachers, you think about it,
[01:20:10] like who wants to become a teacher, and then now becoming a teacher becomes a whole different thing.
[01:20:16] Like right now it's like, I'm a teacher. I want to teach these young minds, you know,
[01:20:20] to get to the next level in life, and all this, like basically all the things that people pursue
[01:20:25] being teachers, yeah, over, um, it shifts to something completely different. Yeah, that being said,
[01:20:31] I bet if there was an option where if you're a school teacher, you can go to a four-week
[01:20:37] summer course on, you know, active shooter response, and then inside of a school with
[01:20:44] 30 teachers, there's three people that have been to this course. I think we're, I think I'm feeling
[01:20:48] good about that. Yeah. Yeah. And then you were a refresher course every summer, and that you know what I'm
[01:20:52] saying, like, you got, you got to train people, you have to train people properly, but people are
[01:20:59] willing to train, because it's beneficial in a multitude of different ways. Yeah, that's it.
[01:21:04] I never thought about that where it's like kind of the optional training or whatever, because
[01:21:08] I was just thinking of it in terms of like, hey, because it's how they, they'd say, I don't, you know,
[01:21:13] they don't go into depth or nothing. They're just like, yeah, I'm the teacher, like all the teachers,
[01:21:17] they got guns. Yeah. So, so to your earlier question is like, what's a solution that won't work?
[01:21:21] The problem with that is the, the problem with that is the details of any solution. You take
[01:21:27] any one of these solutions, and there's certain details that would make it better, and some details
[01:21:32] if you don't include them, are going to make it a disaster. Like you just throw weapons into every
[01:21:36] classroom with random people that haven't been trained, you, you, that's, that's going to be a
[01:21:40] problem. Right? Because you got teachers that are that are that are that micro crazy. Right?
[01:21:45] There's all kinds of things going on. So, you take any of these solutions, and you take it to a certain
[01:21:52] extent. I mean, some of the ways of looking at things can be so different depending on who you are,
[01:21:58] that like what's the term they use, reasonable gun control. Reasonable gun control means completely
[01:22:04] different things to different people depending on who you are and what you're background is. So true.
[01:22:08] And so to just say, hey, we should have reasonable gun control, like I said, that means completely
[01:22:14] different things depending on who you're talking to. Yeah. So, that's why for this, for this, I just
[01:22:21] want to talk about, hey, here's something I do know about and here's pragmatic solution that will
[01:22:26] help and it should be, it should, it should be implemented. Right? That's what you have because
[01:22:33] there, there's guys and, you know, this is going to come as an surprise, but when you put into
[01:22:37] perspective, where there are people who at six years old, they got their first gun. Six. Yeah.
[01:22:44] Yeah. Then same country, same state a lot of time. Maybe even same neighborhood. There are people who
[01:22:51] have never shot a gun ever in their life and they're like 60 years old. Yeah. So, you figure someone
[01:22:56] who's never shot a gun, never handled the gun or whatever. The idea of a gun potentially can be like,
[01:23:02] that is just a death tool. That is just a object of death. So, they just don't know, you know.
[01:23:10] And then versus the guy who got their gun at six and guns are all around the house and cases
[01:23:15] and the truck and all this stuff where it's like, no, it's not a thing. A death is just a tool
[01:23:20] just like a sword hammer or something like that. Where, you know, obviously people say this all the
[01:23:25] time where it's like, hey, you know, if someone kills someone with a hammer, you don't outlaw
[01:23:28] hammers. It's like they literally feel guns are the same exact category. Seems same. But then
[01:23:34] the guy, the person who's never shot a gun, how he's going to feel is like, no, a hammer is to hit
[01:23:38] nails. If someone gets all crazy and start hitting heads with it, that's different. Guns are
[01:23:44] made to shoot people kind of a thing. That's their attitude, you know, or how they feel about it.
[01:23:48] So it's like, yeah, then, okay, now, okay, now we need laws now, right? For the guns,
[01:23:52] but these laws apply to everybody. The six year old guy or the gun is gun at six.
[01:23:58] And also the guy who's never shot a gun ever in his life, these laws have to apply to both people.
[01:24:02] So it's hard to land those laws, you know, effectively where everyone's going to like them.
[01:24:06] Yeah, it's very hard. And what makes it even hard to resist that the two sides don't talk to
[01:24:11] each other in a reasonable way to try and figure out what would be a reasonable solution.
[01:24:17] Yeah, man. So there I am using the reasonable gun laws myself. He's not done.
[01:24:22] In big, it's term. Yeah, it's true. Well, and then, yeah, because you kind of,
[01:24:27] it makes sense on a certain level, even though it's still not effective, right? Where,
[01:24:31] let's say I got a gun. My first gun at six, you know, 22 rifle,
[01:24:36] different trick and awesome. I grow up all kinds of guns, right? I have all kinds of guns
[01:24:41] of shot. My kids shoot guns, all this stuff. And then you have someone, a whole family of people who live
[01:24:45] next door or whatever, across the street. And they have never shot a gun ever in their life and
[01:24:50] their scared of them. So now they're like, hey, you know, we'll just say highly intimidated or something like that.
[01:24:55] So they come about in their, like, oh my gosh, like a gun or whatever. And then the person who's used
[01:25:02] to guns are like, how you're kind of being dumb. You're kind of being unreasonable right now.
[01:25:06] Like this gun, you have to pull the trigger shoot. You know, point out something, pull the trigger
[01:25:10] for it to shoot, whatever. It doesn't just automatically kill people, right?
[01:25:13] So the year dumb for being scared about that kind of stuff, the, it's reasonable that that would
[01:25:20] that feeling would kind of take place. You seem saying. And then you have the opposite feeling where
[01:25:26] it's like, oh, you guys are gun nuts. Like, you have like, you have 50 guns, 50. I've never shot
[01:25:32] a gun in my life. I'm scared of guns and you have 50 of them. Is it unreasonable for me to be uncomfortable?
[01:25:39] I feel like that seems pretty normal. It's what I'm saying. So I'm saying like that conflict makes
[01:25:45] sense to me. Yeah, there's just a total disconnect. Yeah, ineffective, ineffective for solving problems.
[01:25:50] But it's, you can kind of see how it happened. No, you can, you can see how the disconnect occurs.
[01:25:54] But it's a disconnect. And the problem with the disconnect occurs when you don't make any attempts
[01:26:02] to connect. And I just look at you and say, oh, you are a gun nut and you're crazy. And you know,
[01:26:10] I just, it just falls apart. And you look at me thinking, oh, you're a person that wants to take
[01:26:16] all my guns away. And so I'm just not talking to you. Yes, you're some chicken, some, you know,
[01:26:22] incapable chicken, trying to take away all, you know, my guns. Yeah, disconnect. With that,
[01:26:34] if you want to support this podcast, you can go to jockelfuel.com and get yourself some,
[01:26:39] get yourself some stuff to make yourself prepared from a physical sense. Because we got to be
[01:26:45] prepared mentally. How do you do that? You do that through good training. You got to be prepared physically.
[01:26:50] How do you do that? Do good workouts. Train you jitsu. And eat some good food. Take some good
[01:26:57] supplementation. Yeah, the training thing the more you think about it. And this might be obvious to
[01:27:03] you. But the more you think about you understand how deep training and how valuable training in
[01:27:07] every single way. Like you get someone untrained in a situation. I don't even matter the situation.
[01:27:12] I don't care if it's swimming in the pool. Okay. So if someone jumps in the pool falls in the pool,
[01:27:19] they can't swim or they can't swim very well at all. Now, it's dangerous for them. Now you get
[01:27:25] a normal person who just knows how to swim, try to go jump in their encevil. They could get dry. They
[01:27:30] could both die now. Now you get one, one person trained. Probably can save everybody. Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:39] So, Ben, you can take the most arbitrary thing, seemingly. And you train someone, you're better off.
[01:27:44] Yeah, it's weird how people, like the funny thing is to start with leadership because, you know,
[01:27:52] I teach leadership. And people think that they should already know how to lead. And so then you start
[01:27:57] breaking it down from you like, oh damn, I don't know what I'm doing. Fighting. People think they just
[01:28:01] know how to fight. Oh, punch him. When I start to see red, better look out. No, it's like, oh, you
[01:28:06] roll with someone that's, you know, a jitsu player or a real boxer. Yeah. Then you go to square off with
[01:28:11] somebody. If you've never boxed before and you square off with a boxer, you're done. You're done.
[01:28:17] You're done. You're done. You're done. You're done. You get one kick. One kick. If you don't
[01:28:20] train more time, you get kicked in the leg one time. Yeah. There's a decent chance you're done fighting.
[01:28:25] Yes, sir. Well, from a leg kick, yes, sir. There's a decent chance you call it right there. You're
[01:28:30] like, all right, this ain't happened. Yeah. So anything that you do, you, if you want to be good at
[01:28:37] something, you know, the, the thing I always use is guitar. There's no more reason that you would be
[01:28:44] able to fight or lead without training, then you would be able to play a guitar without training.
[01:28:49] Mm-hmm. It doesn't, you just can't, you can't win. You know, like, someone that played basketball
[01:28:55] will beat someone that didn't play basketball 100% of the time. Yeah, the best of all when I think
[01:29:00] is really good because when you see someone playing basketball, you'd be like, yeah, you just take
[01:29:05] that ball, you can't hold it, you got to dribble it or whatever, bounce it and you put in that hoop.
[01:29:10] Like, I know what to do. No, when you go try doing it, you're like, you can't even do it. Yeah. Again,
[01:29:14] like, if someone's trying to do it too with you or against you, whatever, you can't even do it.
[01:29:18] Yeah. So imagine getting a gun that you don't know what to do with it, but you think you know what to
[01:29:22] do with it. You know, you think you're just going to shoot or you think that there's going to be a
[01:29:26] dynamic situation and an active shooter and you think you're going to know what to do or you think
[01:29:31] people are going to be panicking and you think you're not going to be panicking. Yeah. You have to
[01:29:35] train and everything that you do. Think about, even you who's kind of trained in a lot of things,
[01:29:42] think about how many things like the normal person is trained in pretty much nothing. Yeah, not much.
[01:29:48] It's like if you have highly like, if you're highly trained in two things, you're like a jack of
[01:29:53] all trades almost kind of a thing. Think about it. But we're not trained in anything. Oh,
[01:29:58] but I am. You are. Should you have to think about like all the things to be trained in and I'm not
[01:30:06] saying expert. I'm just saying trained. You have like good usable training. What four things?
[01:30:14] Five maybe? Yeah. At the most even.
[01:30:19] I've got some good stuff to train in training. Yeah. You can get yourself some jockel fuel.
[01:30:24] Jockelfield.com. Check it out. Got all by the way, new flavors. Yeah. Updated. Yeah. This is on me.
[01:30:33] On me. All right. Yes. You know, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership. Yeah. Well,
[01:30:38] guess what? The early flavors. My fault. Well, here. This is what you did. I understand. I
[01:30:44] thought about this. This is what you did. This is all you did. It tastes good. So you know, when you're
[01:30:49] when you're young, right? Yeah. Did you ever have those, you know, like on orange juice or whatever
[01:30:54] the concentrate, you know, the one where it's like a frozen like sleeve. Yeah. Exactly. And you put it
[01:31:00] and you mix water. Right. So if you look at the dirt. Okay. So my mom, my mom, guys, would get that
[01:31:05] for us. Right. Orange juice. So it's like four to one or something. Yes. So that's what they did.
[01:31:10] They did four. They filled it up four times and put it in the pitcher. Right. The jug or whatever.
[01:31:16] So my uncle, sweet. Later on when I grew up in high school, I look at it. I look at the directions.
[01:31:21] It's three to one. Seems like they were given us the more watered down version of it. We liked it.
[01:31:29] Love it. Because that's what we were used to. Yeah. Seems like. But I tasted the three to one.
[01:31:33] I was like, probably this is a little bit too concentrated, a little bit too sweet for me.
[01:31:35] Yeah. That's what you did. Yeah. Because they're all used to water. Yeah. It was your main drink
[01:31:40] of choice. So you're like, oh, you put some monk fruit in this new energy drink. All this stuff.
[01:31:45] It seems like sweet. Sweet. Sweet. To me, you got the four to one going. Yeah. But the three to
[01:31:50] one is more our speed. I think a lot of us. It's in. Yeah. It's really like a total. It's almost like
[01:31:55] it's almost like I was like nine to one. So anyways, we got all all new flavors. All new flavors.
