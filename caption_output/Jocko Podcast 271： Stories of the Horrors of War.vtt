00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.28
This is Jockel Podcast number 271 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:12.000
I got good evening.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.32
First they put us in a school in Tala Far and held us for 20 days. They didn't let us eat or drink.

4
00:00:24.32 --> 00:00:29.76
Only the children are given a little bread, but we had to go to the bathroom to share it.

5
00:00:29.76 --> 00:00:40.24
If they caught us sharing, we were tortured. The children were dying, starving.

6
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:48.16
They wouldn't drink the little amount of dirty water. So we found some toothpaste and put it in the

7
00:00:48.16 --> 00:00:52.64
water to pretend it was milk so they would drink it and not die from dehydration.

8
00:00:52.64 --> 00:01:03.68
Dold of emotion, Basima recalled everything down to the most minor detail.

9
00:01:03.68 --> 00:01:09.36
How they were transferred to Mazul in cattle trucks and stashed in a traditional ceremony hall.

10
00:01:09.92 --> 00:01:16.80
How the elderly had to give their children urine to drink to keep them alive after ISIS cut their

11
00:01:16.80 --> 00:01:25.04
only water pipe. How everyone became so sick and malnourished that clumps of their hair would fall to the floor.

12
00:01:29.28 --> 00:01:37.76
But the worst was yet to come. In the middle of the night, the ISIS men were coming in and yelling

13
00:01:37.76 --> 00:01:46.32
to know who is still a virgin, Basima whispered. And from the age of eight, they were taking girls

14
00:01:46.32 --> 00:01:56.64
to the market to sell for a cigarette. However, Basima and several other siblings fought up a plan

15
00:01:56.64 --> 00:02:03.76
to avoid being violated. They tried to look like ugly boys by using a piece of broken plate to

16
00:02:03.76 --> 00:02:07.36
shave their heads and dressed in the men's clothes they found hidden away.

17
00:02:10.16 --> 00:02:14.64
We thought if they must have stuck us for boys, we would be taken out and killed.

18
00:02:14.64 --> 00:02:23.44
Rather than raped, she explained. But instead, when they knew our trick, the men came in and

19
00:02:23.44 --> 00:02:31.04
stripped us in front of everybody. In front of everybody, hundreds. They touched us everywhere,

20
00:02:31.04 --> 00:02:41.52
sexually abused us. My father and brother had to watch. And that was the last I saw of them.

21
00:02:46.64 --> 00:02:54.16
Basima did not shut her when she talked about the abuse. She was telling her story, but she was also

22
00:02:54.16 --> 00:03:02.80
telling somebody else's story. She was telling the story of so many other women. Perhaps that is

23
00:03:02.80 --> 00:03:08.24
how she was able to get through it with strength by separating herself from the narrative.

24
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.44
When initially snatched, Gazal was with her six-month-old son,

25
00:03:19.44 --> 00:03:29.04
Boktyar, and five-year-old daughter, Darren. When Gazal, while Gazal clutched her screaming

26
00:03:29.04 --> 00:03:35.52
son, Basima claimed to be the mother of Darren, it hopes that the ISIS operatives wouldn't sell her

27
00:03:35.52 --> 00:03:45.12
if it was clear she was no longer a virgin. Gazal spoke of her ordeal in a tempered rhythm,

28
00:03:45.12 --> 00:03:50.24
relentlessly tugging at her dress and glaring at her raw crack-tands.

29
00:03:54.16 --> 00:04:02.56
At first, she said she refused to go with the wally, but he dragged her by her hair and took her to

30
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:08.72
her and back to her to the Syrian city of Minn-Biz near the Torque Turkish border.

31
00:04:08.72 --> 00:04:20.000
They were yanked into a house like the headquarters where there were already two other Yazidi slaves

32
00:04:20.80 --> 00:04:29.04
and a constant ebb of foreign fighters. The wally said, I must marry him,

33
00:04:30.88 --> 00:04:35.04
but I refused so he took my son and I didn't see him for two days.

34
00:04:35.04 --> 00:04:45.12
After that I begged and cried. He started torturing me and said I had no option but to marry him.

35
00:04:49.20 --> 00:04:57.84
Only it wasn't a real marriage, but it was no ceremony. It was just rape.

36
00:04:57.84 --> 00:05:06.32
I was forced to be a Muslim to pray five times a day.

37
00:05:12.72 --> 00:05:18.88
The coalition bombs soon started falling on ISIS installations, bases and homes,

38
00:05:18.88 --> 00:05:24.64
but they also fell on people who were already scared and suffering, who had no arms and no

39
00:05:24.64 --> 00:05:32.88
choice but to be there. After Gazal was gone, Basimah said that she and scores of others,

40
00:05:32.88 --> 00:05:36.72
including Yang Daren were wounded in an air strike on the prison.

41
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:46.24
Shrapnel pierced her head. Basimah's only treatment was her long ebbony locks getting shaved off.

42
00:05:46.24 --> 00:05:56.64
She received no medicine. The slaves were propelled down 22 skewed steps into an underground

43
00:05:56.64 --> 00:06:02.80
weapon storage filled with guns and bombs which would become their living quarters for more than a year.

44
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:15.20
We were tortured. There were no toilets, we had to eat, sleep and do the necessary

45
00:06:15.20 --> 00:06:25.20
all in the same place. All kinds of insects and flies were in there. They forced us to convert to

46
00:06:25.20 --> 00:06:30.56
Islam. We were made to look at beheaded bodies through the little window.

47
00:06:33.76 --> 00:06:42.24
We didn't know when our time was up. All we could think about was whether it was better to live

48
00:06:42.24 --> 00:07:07.60
or to die. What is a war? It is trying to remember those we treasure who are taken while

49
00:07:07.60 --> 00:07:15.92
at the same time trying to let them go. What is war? It is waiting to kill or is waiting to be killed.

50
00:07:18.32 --> 00:07:23.84
What is war? War is a war inside the war which the world cannot see.

51
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:32.56
But sometimes if you get close enough you can hear it. It is inmates being endlessly beaten,

52
00:07:32.56 --> 00:07:41.36
lashed, mailed with statistic tools and kept in small cages. What is war?

53
00:07:43.28 --> 00:07:48.80
A human shell might have made it through the storm in one piece. But what is inside will forever

54
00:07:48.80 --> 00:07:56.000
be filled with a dull pain of waiting, waiting for evil to enter to violate the person they once were

55
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:11.36
one more time. What is war? It is ugly. It is lies. It is ugly. Lies. What is war?

56
00:08:11.36 --> 00:08:24.56
War is distrust, dishonesty, skepticism. What is war? War is a vision of agony that becomes normal.

57
00:08:26.56 --> 00:08:34.48
That's what war does to people. What is war? Everything you could imagine hell to be.

58
00:08:34.48 --> 00:08:54.16
Only worse. And those are some excerpts from a book called Only Cry for the Living,

59
00:08:54.16 --> 00:09:05.12
which as you can see is a harling book about the absolutely savage reign of terror perpetrated by ISIS.

60
00:09:06.40 --> 00:09:13.20
I rack and Syria. And throughout the book, it asks that question over and over again. What is war?

61
00:09:13.20 --> 00:09:25.76
War. And that is a complex question. And it requires answers from many different angles.

62
00:09:28.72 --> 00:09:35.44
And this book does an incredible job of giving us some of those answers. The book was written by

63
00:09:35.44 --> 00:09:44.88
an Australian American journalist by the name of Holly McKay who spent time on the ground in Iraq.

64
00:09:44.88 --> 00:09:51.60
Afghanistan and Syria has been embedded with Australian and American troops sat through military

65
00:09:51.60 --> 00:09:59.84
tribunals and interviewed hundreds of soldiers, civilians, and government officials before

66
00:09:59.84 --> 00:10:12.40
during and after the horrors of war. And it is an honor to have Holly here with us to share

67
00:10:12.40 --> 00:10:20.48
some of her experiences and some of the things that she learned along the way. Holly.

68
00:10:22.88 --> 00:10:29.60
Thank you so much for coming down to join us. Thank you for having me. This is definitely

69
00:10:29.60 --> 00:10:40.88
a very rough subject that you dove into and that you pursued. And I didn't know you or anything about

70
00:10:40.88 --> 00:10:45.84
you really until I started reading through the book. I just basically knew that you were a journalist.

71
00:10:47.28 --> 00:10:52.32
But there's some interesting the pathway that you took to get here as I kind of explored that

72
00:10:52.32 --> 00:10:59.44
is interesting. And before we jump into the book, I just want to kind of get some of your background.

73
00:11:00.88 --> 00:11:04.08
You know what's going to say most books and it's true. And most books people at least

74
00:11:05.44 --> 00:11:08.80
people write books and they say they're not about themselves, but they write about themselves.

75
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:12.80
Right? And you actually don't spend a lot of time writing about yourself in this book.

76
00:11:13.44 --> 00:11:20.16
So just a little background before we jump in about, you know, so you were born in Australia.

77
00:11:20.16 --> 00:11:24.96
Yes. So I was born in North Queensland in Australia and my dad was in the mine so we moved

78
00:11:24.96 --> 00:11:31.84
around a fair bit. And then when I was very young, I became very, very heavily involved in ballet.

79
00:11:31.84 --> 00:11:37.36
And so when I was 15, I went to a boarding school. It was kind of a fame school

80
00:11:38.16 --> 00:11:45.20
in Sydney where we could train full time in different sort of arts. And then we did our sort of

81
00:11:45.20 --> 00:11:50.72
schooling on the side as well with that. And we could all work professionally. And so it was just a

82
00:11:50.72 --> 00:11:56.48
very interesting way to study and grow up. And I really thought that that was the career that I was

83
00:11:56.48 --> 00:12:00.80
going to go into. It was going to be ballet dance. It was going to be ballet. Also that is a

84
00:12:00.80 --> 00:12:06.96
psycho totally psycho thing. Totally psycho thing. And I, you know, but what I always say and people think

85
00:12:06.96 --> 00:12:13.36
it's just it was the best training ground for what I ended up doing because you you learn to just

86
00:12:13.36 --> 00:12:18.72
to push yourself beyond any kind of boundary that you ever think. And that's just normal. And when

87
00:12:18.72 --> 00:12:24.000
you're that young, you're just it's normal to be 15 hours a day in these crazy shoes with bloody

88
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.96
feet and being yelled at and being told, you know, you can only eat this, this and this and you

89
00:12:28.96 --> 00:12:33.52
have to weigh this. And it's just this so much discipline involved in it. And it really was the

90
00:12:33.52 --> 00:12:38.40
most amazing training ground. But on top of that, what it did was it really taught me so much

91
00:12:38.40 --> 00:12:43.84
about the world that I wouldn't have known in my Australian bubble. When you say what you just

92
00:12:43.84 --> 00:12:49.04
realize that through ballet, there's all these different countries. You know, I'll get yeah,

93
00:12:49.04 --> 00:12:52.24
like I give me something to go on. Because for me, you grow up a little New England kid. It's like,

94
00:12:52.88 --> 00:12:57.76
okay, cool, this is the world. Yeah, and it's, you know, I learned about the civil rights movement

95
00:12:57.76 --> 00:13:04.16
through Alvin Ali who was this incredible, he's got an art center in New York City. And that's how

96
00:13:04.16 --> 00:13:09.60
he had this amazing piece called Revelations. And I just remember being about 16 and just watching

97
00:13:09.60 --> 00:13:14.64
it and just the music and it was gospel music. And I learned about this sort of whole culture.

98
00:13:14.64 --> 00:13:19.36
And we did that with so many parts of it. I think the Rolling Stones, that was this amazing

99
00:13:19.36 --> 00:13:24.08
ballet with that Canadian company, it's set to the Rolling Stones. And so I learned about

100
00:13:24.80 --> 00:13:29.28
hedonism and all these, you know, different things in an era that I really didn't know. And

101
00:13:29.28 --> 00:13:35.36
it really sparked this insatiable appetite for the world. And that was through the music. And

102
00:13:35.36 --> 00:13:40.000
this sort of deeply, a beyond that. And I really, that was what I wanted to pursue. And that's

103
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.56
sort of why I guess I left, I left time very young to go and study. I broke my ankle. So that sort of

104
00:13:46.56 --> 00:13:53.28
set back some of the immediate professional ideals that I had. And so as soon as I kind of healed a

105
00:13:53.28 --> 00:13:59.12
bit, gone to university, an opportunity came up to go to New York to, I had, I got a scholarship

106
00:13:59.12 --> 00:14:04.24
I could finish my degree there. And so I thought, you know, well, finish a degree. Maybe I'll go

107
00:14:04.24 --> 00:14:10.64
back into the arts. I didn't work out that way. I ended up in a journalism career and it was not planned at all.

108
00:14:11.92 --> 00:14:15.84
But yeah. When you went to New York, did you go to study dance still?

109
00:14:15.84 --> 00:14:20.72
No, so I was studying at a small university, just off Wall Street, called Paste. That was affiliated

110
00:14:20.72 --> 00:14:26.48
with my university in Sydney. And I was studying, it was media arts, but I had a specialty kind of

111
00:14:26.48 --> 00:14:31.52
in writing was what I loved. And I wasn't sure what direction I was going to take that or whether

112
00:14:31.52 --> 00:14:38.32
I was going to go back into the ballet field. So being in New York City, I got a chance to do both,

113
00:14:38.32 --> 00:14:44.88
you know, sort of the hub of creativity really. And kind of study and have a really great time.

114
00:14:44.88 --> 00:14:51.68
I turned 21 in New York. Then, then, so did you, what did you end up getting your degree in?

115
00:14:51.68 --> 00:14:58.16
Media Arts and Production. And with the specialization, you know, it's a fancy BA, but it's,

116
00:14:58.16 --> 00:15:03.52
I specialized in sort of writing and human rights issues. So I always had that sort of passion

117
00:15:03.52 --> 00:15:09.12
of trying to understand the world in a little bit of a deeper lens, I guess, at that point.

118
00:15:09.12 --> 00:15:15.76
So what year did you graduate from college? 2003. And then, did you go back to Australia?

119
00:15:15.76 --> 00:15:22.24
So no, so when I was in New York and I arrived and then everybody is talking about these internships.

120
00:15:22.24 --> 00:15:28.16
And I had no idea what it was. You know, Australia, we just work, you know, you work, you go to school,

121
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:32.80
you, whatever. So they're talking about internships and I was like, I want to do one of those things.

122
00:15:32.80 --> 00:15:37.36
What are they? This sounds fascinating. And I went to a bunch of websites and

123
00:15:38.24 --> 00:15:42.96
stumbled across a fox website. And I didn't, I didn't even know what fox news was at that time.

124
00:15:42.96 --> 00:15:50.88
And it was early digital era. And I taught myself to web code just for fun one at school. And so they

125
00:15:50.88 --> 00:15:56.64
said, well, we're building up a digital thing, you know, you obviously seem to like that kind of thing.

126
00:15:56.64 --> 00:16:02.000
Would you like to do that? So I thought, yeah, I'll give this a go. This sounds great. And so I joined

127
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.24
the newsroom there. And I really, I fell in love with storytelling in a different way. I was so used

128
00:16:08.24 --> 00:16:15.44
to doing it through dance, through physically, through my body, through other, and being able to kind

129
00:16:15.44 --> 00:16:20.48
of be there and it was much more literal than what I'd used to. But I really, I fell in love with it

130
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:26.96
and being able to write. And this whole new medium was just beginning. And I just, I really threw

131
00:16:26.96 --> 00:16:32.24
myself into it. And I loved it. And then, at the end of it, you know, as I said, I was 21 and they

132
00:16:32.24 --> 00:16:36.88
said, well, sponsor you if you'd like to come in and work here full of time. And so that sort of

133
00:16:36.88 --> 00:16:43.12
made up my mind pretty quickly that that was a pretty amazing opportunity. And the dance career

134
00:16:43.12 --> 00:16:52.08
might have to be for another life. So yeah, so I was sponsored. And they said, would you like to go to

135
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:56.96
LA? And I was, I was really in love with New York. But I said, sure, let's go to LA. And let's do this.

136
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:04.56
And so I went to LA. And I guess by default, being in Los Angeles, there was, you know, the entertainment

137
00:17:04.56 --> 00:17:11.60
hub of the world. And so that sort of seems to be, and I had my own column, which again was sort of

138
00:17:12.24 --> 00:17:20.000
a bit of a baptism by fire. And I was just immediately thrown into this cage of, oh, yeah, I described it

139
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.56
when I got there, Joko. It was the summer of 2007. And Paratelsin had just gotten out of jail.

140
00:17:26.56 --> 00:17:31.44
And somehow I'd made friends with an assistant of hers. And she was living in this beach house

141
00:17:31.44 --> 00:17:38.64
down in Malibu. And so every day we go to these parties at Paratelsin. And it was, the paparazzi

142
00:17:38.64 --> 00:17:43.52
were lining up on the beach. And I just remember thinking, this is the biggest circus I've ever seen.

143
00:17:43.52 --> 00:17:51.84
Like, this is this is ridiculous. And it stayed that way for me. And I think even though I had

144
00:17:51.84 --> 00:17:57.92
some really incredible opportunities and to meet really amazing people too. And I don't think I really

145
00:17:57.92 --> 00:18:03.44
at the time, you know, when you get to sit down for 20 minutes with Steven Spielberg or something,

146
00:18:03.44 --> 00:18:08.64
I don't think I really, you know, valued. I think it was just, it was too young to kind of understand.

147
00:18:08.64 --> 00:18:14.32
This is pretty cool. But I just got to meet so many people from different walks of life. I would be

148
00:18:14.96 --> 00:18:20.08
I'd be covering a sug-night trial and comp to it. And then next minute I'd be, you know, driving to

149
00:18:20.72 --> 00:18:26.80
a choreography session with the SPICE Girls reunion tour. It was just this real crazy, you know,

150
00:18:26.80 --> 00:18:32.000
they'd be at that, you know, a ditty's party and then I would be at, you know, some other cool place.

151
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.64
And it put to me the funny thing about it was I always felt, I was the outside looking in at something.

152
00:18:38.64 --> 00:18:45.60
I never felt part of it. I just felt like this was this, it was a launch pad, but it was this

153
00:18:45.60 --> 00:18:52.000
incredible stepping stone. And I guess similar to the ballet, it told me something really crucial,

154
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.08
which was just enough out the BS. And that's something that's, I don't think there's a better training

155
00:18:58.08 --> 00:19:04.000
ground for that than than being in that entertainment world. Because you learn to see through people so

156
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.24
quickly and you learn to really navigate, there's so many layers around these people. They have

157
00:19:10.24 --> 00:19:17.92
publicist managers, there's just so many layers. And a lot of intimidation people trying to stop

158
00:19:17.92 --> 00:19:23.20
you from running a story, people trying to spin this this way that way. And it really taught me

159
00:19:23.20 --> 00:19:28.80
it from a very young age to be very resilient against that. To be, no, that's not, that's not what I saw.

160
00:19:28.80 --> 00:19:34.32
That's not what happened. That's not what the situation is. Why are you doing that? And I think,

161
00:19:34.32 --> 00:19:38.72
yeah, I can't imagine that's something that's really served me, served me really well.

162
00:19:39.76 --> 00:19:45.92
So the name of this, what was the name of your column? Poptons. This is my old boss. I don't know where

163
00:19:45.92 --> 00:19:50.08
that came from. He just came up with it when day to day. This is what it's going to be. And I,

164
00:19:50.08 --> 00:19:57.52
let's do it. Did you, isn't it, as a reporter, aren't you supposed to feel like an outsider?

165
00:19:57.52 --> 00:20:02.24
Are you supposed to be on the outside looking in? And technically yes, but in the entertainment industry,

166
00:20:02.24 --> 00:20:08.16
and this is one thing that always bothered me about it was that people were so busy trying to be

167
00:20:08.16 --> 00:20:13.36
friends with these people. And I could never get my head around. And I was like, they're not my friend.

168
00:20:13.36 --> 00:20:17.12
I don't want to be that friend. I have my own friends. And so I think people always,

169
00:20:17.84 --> 00:20:23.44
automatically assume that you must, yeah, that you must, you know, want to be this friend and everyone's

170
00:20:23.44 --> 00:20:28.32
kissing each other's ass on a red carpet. Don't you look great tonight? No, what?

171
00:20:29.44 --> 00:20:34.88
So people get totally sucked into the whole thing. Totally sucked in. Yeah. And that was what,

172
00:20:34.88 --> 00:20:39.92
yeah, that was one thing that annoyed Mary. I, I remember being about 22 and one of those

173
00:20:39.92 --> 00:20:44.88
big entertainment shows, a producer had approached me and said, you know, we'd love to talk to you

174
00:20:44.88 --> 00:20:50.48
about a job in this and that and probably stupidly because the money was probably quite good. But I

175
00:20:50.48 --> 00:20:56.32
said, oh, no, not interested. Thank you. And that was about my immediate reaction was I would just

176
00:20:56.32 --> 00:21:01.92
have to sit there and basically be nice to you all the time. And that wasn't, that wasn't the

177
00:21:01.92 --> 00:21:10.32
person I was. I wanted to understand the real story behind it. And it's hard to do that in the

178
00:21:10.32 --> 00:21:14.96
Hollywood without sort of being being shunned, I guess. And anyone who does kind of do that,

179
00:21:14.96 --> 00:21:20.000
they are shunned. They don't get the access. They want to, the places and things. And I think

180
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.48
people are really drawn to that world because they want to feel that, that being part of something.

181
00:21:26.48 --> 00:21:33.68
So at what point did you sort of envision where what you really wanted to do?

182
00:21:34.48 --> 00:21:42.08
So I was a slow process. I started to do a lot more sort of investigative work. And then I would sort

183
00:21:42.08 --> 00:21:48.56
of pick up different politics stories. I was always very vested in world affairs and there was a great

184
00:21:49.12 --> 00:21:54.16
afar and correspondence in our bureau and he'd spent a lot of time living in Pakistan and just,

185
00:21:54.16 --> 00:21:59.68
you know, having credible stories and he really, and I sat with him and he really gave me that

186
00:21:59.68 --> 00:22:04.88
encouragement that I needed. And that was just you just have to go and do it. You love to travel,

187
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:09.44
you've traveled to all these places and I, and I traveled a lot and I'd sort of learnt to speak

188
00:22:09.44 --> 00:22:15.04
a little bit of Arabic it's gone now. But growing up I'd learned to speak and I just had a real

189
00:22:15.04 --> 00:22:21.12
appetite for understanding different parts of the world and kind of growing up, growing up in the

190
00:22:21.12 --> 00:22:28.16
time when Afghanistan and Iraq and a lot of friends of mine that were my age were kind of being deployed.

191
00:22:28.16 --> 00:22:35.12
And so I always really wanted to understand it and then with his name was Dominique and his support

192
00:22:35.12 --> 00:22:41.04
was just you've just got to go and do it. And so I just, I really just had to put myself out there.

193
00:22:41.04 --> 00:22:46.16
I had to be that annoying person to my bosses. I wanted you this. I wanted to do this. I wanted to do this.

194
00:22:46.16 --> 00:22:54.88
And luckily I had people in New York that supported me that looked at my work and thought, well,

195
00:22:54.88 --> 00:22:59.12
we've thrown her on so many different stories and she's always managed to come back with something.

196
00:22:59.12 --> 00:23:03.04
And she knows how to investigate. She knows how to work independently. So why not?

197
00:23:03.76 --> 00:23:08.08
So that was sort of my, my segue into it. And I really reached a point where I knew I had to leave

198
00:23:08.08 --> 00:23:12.08
that it's a tame thing and did you create enemies in the entertainment thing?

199
00:23:12.08 --> 00:23:17.36
And I wouldn't say I created enemies. I mean, there was certain, you know,

200
00:23:17.36 --> 00:23:20.80
I definitely had a few run-ins and I definitely spoke my mind.

201
00:23:21.44 --> 00:23:25.76
Probably more than it seems like if you had the attitude like, I'm going to tell the truth and

202
00:23:25.76 --> 00:23:30.88
people are trying to adjust your stories and you're like, not not complying with what they want you to do.

203
00:23:30.88 --> 00:23:35.68
It seems like it'd be pretty easy environment to make people mad. Yes.

204
00:23:35.68 --> 00:23:41.84
Yeah, I did. And then, sort of I guess, toward the last year or six months I was doing it. I,

205
00:23:43.44 --> 00:23:49.28
I probably looking back and I'd check that out a little bit. But yeah, you do. You create enemies

206
00:23:49.84 --> 00:23:55.12
as you go. And again, I just, I think I just slowly was removing myself at that point anyway.

207
00:23:55.12 --> 00:24:00.32
So what was the first, did you get like an assignment to, like your first assignment that started

208
00:24:00.32 --> 00:24:08.32
to move you down this path of this going to war? So I was, I was in, and I sort of been traveling

209
00:24:08.32 --> 00:24:14.88
through the area and then I ended up doing some work there. I guess the biggest one was,

210
00:24:14.88 --> 00:24:23.44
I was in the Middle East during when 2014, the Warbroke out in Gaza. So I was sort of going back

211
00:24:23.44 --> 00:24:29.12
and forth between Israel and Gaza and sort of being able to cover it because I was there.

212
00:24:29.12 --> 00:24:35.36
That was kind of my baptism by fire. What were you doing there? I was vacationing, visiting

213
00:24:35.36 --> 00:24:39.84
friends in Jordan. I was hanging out with Bedouins in a Bedouin tent. And you know,

214
00:24:39.84 --> 00:24:45.76
you know, a pen in a notebook and a comma. Yeah, and then you have contacts back in your

215
00:24:45.76 --> 00:24:51.04
news station. You say, here's what's going on. And I wrote some stuff there and then I sort of went

216
00:24:51.04 --> 00:24:55.84
back and I thought this was just, and at that time that was also when I assisted sort of really

217
00:24:55.84 --> 00:25:03.12
sparked, I guess, in the Middle East. And I'd been covering a closely sort of following the

218
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:09.68
Arab Spring, which was all in those years prior to that. So I just, I was so invested in it,

219
00:25:09.68 --> 00:25:16.48
I guess. And I harassed and harassed and then made contacts with different people and fixes on the ground

220
00:25:16.48 --> 00:25:26.32
in Iraq. And yeah, I went for to cover ISIS, I guess, after that would have been the fall of 2014.

221
00:25:26.32 --> 00:25:33.12
So that was in the very beginning stages. I mean, I'm just sitting here thinking,

222
00:25:34.32 --> 00:25:40.56
we, everybody kind of knew what ISIS was. It's a very courageous move to say,

223
00:25:40.56 --> 00:25:45.44
that's what I'm going to go. Do go find out what these folks are up to. And I use the term folks

224
00:25:45.44 --> 00:25:53.28
very loosely with them. You know, I'm going to end and, and, um, as I read through the book, which I'm

225
00:25:53.28 --> 00:25:58.000
going to, I'm not going to do it justice because, you know, we're only going to read, obviously,

226
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
not going to read the whole thing right now. The, the book is, you know, I got the manuscript.

227
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.24
I don't know when. So a year ago, six months ago, a year ago, something like that,

228
00:26:09.20 --> 00:26:14.88
because we ended up publishing it at Jockel Publishing, which was awesome. It's, when I, I read

229
00:26:14.88 --> 00:26:20.000
like the first seven pages and just said to myself, are you kidding me? This thing, this story needs to

230
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.64
get out. So with that, um, I always have to make that caveat that when I read this thing,

231
00:26:28.64 --> 00:26:32.88
it's, if it seems like it's, oh, wait, where did that come from? Who's that character? It's because

232
00:26:32.88 --> 00:26:40.000
I'm not reading the whole thing. And you, you have to get the book to really, to follow your story.

233
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.08
And it is chronological, you know, it starts off in November of 2014. It ends up when close to 2019,

234
00:26:46.08 --> 00:26:52.56
I think, but it is chronological, but it's also, it's a moves around from location to location,

235
00:26:52.56 --> 00:26:56.96
story to story, because sometimes you're in Baghdad, sometimes you're in Raka, sometimes you're

236
00:26:57.52 --> 00:27:02.56
out on the outskirts of Missouil, you're traveling to all these different places, but it's,

237
00:27:02.56 --> 00:27:08.08
it's way more evident when you read the book, the whole book rather than me just sitting here reading

238
00:27:08.08 --> 00:27:18.96
chunks of it. So that's my caveat. When you are traveling over there, just, are you just traveling,

239
00:27:18.96 --> 00:27:26.40
are you traveling on an American passport? So I became an American citizen in 2017. So initially,

240
00:27:26.40 --> 00:27:33.68
I was just Australian, I was a green cod holder, and then I got, I got my citizenship in 2017.

241
00:27:33.68 --> 00:27:38.56
And then when you're traveling into a country, so I was in the military, and so we would have

242
00:27:40.40 --> 00:27:45.52
an official passport. So not a diplomatic passport, which was a black passport,

243
00:27:46.08 --> 00:27:51.68
but not a regular American passport, which is a maroon passport. We would have blue passports,

244
00:27:51.68 --> 00:27:58.08
which said that we're official, I guess, government Americans, is there anything that you have

245
00:27:58.08 --> 00:28:04.24
that gives you some kind of indication as press? Nope, journalists, it just regular citizens.

246
00:28:06.24 --> 00:28:12.000
Nothing special. You're rolling in there. Yeah. Who's supplying you with gear? Who's giving you

247
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.96
body armor? Who's giving you helmets? Right. So I did, I did have my, we all generally as journalists,

248
00:28:18.96 --> 00:28:24.32
we all have our own, or I arranged to wherever I'm going, if I could. Get me training? Yeah,

249
00:28:24.32 --> 00:28:28.64
we're kind of chasing this. Just sort of basic, you know, a hostage training, just kind of the

250
00:28:28.64 --> 00:28:35.44
basic first aid. You just kind of have to do a few basic things you go, but most of my training

251
00:28:35.44 --> 00:28:40.40
was really on the ground. And the approach that I decided to take really early on, which I think

252
00:28:40.40 --> 00:28:48.08
served me, and it's probably their approach that I will always take, is very under the radar. So

253
00:28:48.08 --> 00:28:52.80
I would see people that went in, especially, and it's very difficult with television, because television

254
00:28:52.80 --> 00:28:59.60
crews have to go in with cameras, and they go in with a lot of security, and you become very visible.

255
00:28:59.60 --> 00:29:06.32
For me, I went in. I would organize to meet with locals wherever it is. I was going my local fixer,

256
00:29:07.04 --> 00:29:12.64
local house, I'd be staying in, and I would just very much go under the radar. And to me,

257
00:29:12.64 --> 00:29:17.20
that was always the way that I felt that I could get the story, and even though people thought,

258
00:29:17.20 --> 00:29:20.40
oh, you have to have security, you have to have this, you have to have that.

259
00:29:20.40 --> 00:29:27.20
I never felt they needed that. I felt that that would have made me more of a known presence,

260
00:29:27.20 --> 00:29:33.68
which would have been more dangerous for me. As a writer, I felt that I didn't need a lot of those

261
00:29:33.68 --> 00:29:40.16
things, and that was always, and I discussed those things with my, with my superiors, and ahead of time,

262
00:29:40.16 --> 00:29:47.52
and that was always something that they took, and enabled me to make those decisions, and be that

263
00:29:47.52 --> 00:29:53.60
independent. And how good was your Arabic? It was okay for a while. Where did you learn Arabic?

264
00:29:53.60 --> 00:29:59.04
You know, I grew up, so where I was going to school was a sort of there was a big Lebanese community there.

265
00:29:59.04 --> 00:30:04.88
So I was interested, and I just, I would have people teach me, and so, but I always worked with

266
00:30:04.88 --> 00:30:09.20
the translator because I couldn't pick up the dialects. I mean, the dialects were just so confusing,

267
00:30:09.20 --> 00:30:15.68
and I didn't want to risk ever, I guess, getting something that would have been crucial and getting it wrong.

268
00:30:15.68 --> 00:30:22.24
Yeah, I know that the locals' ability to understand and give you these nuanced things,

269
00:30:22.24 --> 00:30:26.88
you know, the interpreters that we had would, you know, because we'd have, we'd have Americans,

270
00:30:26.88 --> 00:30:32.88
like seals that had been trained to speak Arabic. I God bless them. They do their best.

271
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:40.56
But like you just, they be standing side by side with a native speaker, and, you know, my

272
00:30:40.56 --> 00:30:46.88
seal interpreter would say, hey, the local guy said this, and then the native speaker would say,

273
00:30:46.88 --> 00:30:51.44
hey, here's what he actually means, and there's just a little bit that you're just not going to catch,

274
00:30:51.44 --> 00:30:57.12
you know, it's just not going to happen. So you definitely, it's like trying to

275
00:30:57.12 --> 00:31:01.68
try to tell the difference between, you know, someone that's from New York, and someone that's from New Jersey.

276
00:31:02.48 --> 00:31:05.84
There's people that can go, oh, yeah, guys from Jersey, that guy's from New York, you know,

277
00:31:05.84 --> 00:31:13.84
and the same thing overseas. And you are correct. Here's the weird thing about what you said about

278
00:31:13.84 --> 00:31:23.04
security is a low profile, 99% of the time is going to be better, no one's going to notice you,

279
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:28.88
no one's going to care, but people freak out about us. There's that 1% of the time, and then what

280
00:31:28.88 --> 00:31:32.40
do you do? And then you weigh those out, because if it's only, if there's only a tiny chance of

281
00:31:32.40 --> 00:31:36.72
something happening, and then you're in a really bad situation, because you don't have any security,

282
00:31:36.72 --> 00:31:43.36
that's horrible. But when you have security, you increase the chances so much that it's a gamble.

283
00:31:43.36 --> 00:31:49.68
This is always a gamble. And I always felt very comfortable in the fixes and the people that I use

284
00:31:49.68 --> 00:31:56.32
locally that they had sort of the know how to at least, you know, with exit plans and other things like

285
00:31:56.32 --> 00:32:02.08
that. And I always had context in the US, in the region, and other places that if I was desperate,

286
00:32:02.08 --> 00:32:06.96
that I could, I could turn to if I, if I needed to. How did you go about finding your fixtures?

287
00:32:08.40 --> 00:32:13.36
General, I mean, depending on the sort of assignment by assignment, but I usually went through

288
00:32:13.36 --> 00:32:18.32
either other journalists who gave referrals to people that they'd worked with, or people that

289
00:32:18.32 --> 00:32:22.88
knew that were living there without the businesses that had used different interpreters. It really

290
00:32:22.88 --> 00:32:27.44
really depended on that. But usually, it's always what a mouth. I would never just pluck

291
00:32:27.44 --> 00:32:35.36
somebody a face-fucking and expect them to be a fixer. It always be several layers of people who

292
00:32:35.36 --> 00:32:40.96
could sort of vet and work for them and then do a little bit of my own background digging on them

293
00:32:40.96 --> 00:32:44.96
and just try to make sure. And you can never get it right there. I mean, there's plenty of situations

294
00:32:44.96 --> 00:32:49.12
and unfortunately, we're journalists have been sold out and other things, and we saw that a lot

295
00:32:49.12 --> 00:33:00.16
in Syria with us, but in my case, I always worked with some really just incredible people.

296
00:33:00.16 --> 00:33:03.04
I've got all kinds of scenarios running through my head right now.

297
00:33:03.04 --> 00:33:09.04
I get an attention. When I look back at my life, my whole life, in my entire life, from the time

298
00:33:09.04 --> 00:33:14.32
I was born until like two days ago, I always think about all the things that I've done, where I look

299
00:33:14.32 --> 00:33:19.76
back and say, man, that wasn't too smart. How good. Do you do that? I was in the medicine that I thought

300
00:33:19.76 --> 00:33:24.96
the things that I did. I mean, not just in a rock, but in a rather places in Yemen and Afghanistan,

301
00:33:24.96 --> 00:33:30.40
and in my 20s, and I just would never do them now. I would never do them now. I look back and I think,

302
00:33:30.40 --> 00:33:39.68
what were you thinking? Or, I guess, in the beginning, and this is where experience comes into it.

303
00:33:39.68 --> 00:33:44.40
You almost, maybe it's naivety. You don't always know what you're getting yourself into,

304
00:33:45.04 --> 00:33:51.12
and you get out of it, and you find, and then I look back on it now, and I think that was so stupid.

305
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.20
What you're thinking? That wasn't all worth the story. I mean, did you even get a story out of that?

306
00:33:59.20 --> 00:34:06.40
Yeah. As I read your book, that's what I was thinking. There's a lot of you got lucky a lot,

307
00:34:06.40 --> 00:34:11.20
which is awesome. You know, you had a massive amount of courage to go into these, which is awesome.

308
00:34:11.84 --> 00:34:17.12
And I wanted to ask you that. Did you feel, do you feel looking back like now, like you

309
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:25.76
you were a little naiv at the time? And obviously, sometimes a little bit of naivety and arrogance

310
00:34:26.64 --> 00:34:31.36
is really nice when you look back at it if it went well. Which it certainly did for you.

311
00:34:31.36 --> 00:34:40.64
Awesome. All right. I'm going to jump into this book. The first boy to introduce himself was

312
00:34:40.64 --> 00:34:46.48
a nine-year-old named Abdulla. He struck me with his light eyes, gap to smile, and spattering of

313
00:34:46.48 --> 00:34:51.20
freckles across his nose. There was a gentleness to it, to his demeanor. I wondered how such

314
00:34:51.20 --> 00:34:58.16
gentleness could come from a child that had been ripped from his home by war. Abdulla told us that

315
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:06.40
he was a Muslim from Sinjar, or Sinjal, as they say in Kurdish. He had been forced to flee

316
00:35:06.40 --> 00:35:11.12
two months earlier when ISIS invaded his village. He insisted on showing us around the camp,

317
00:35:11.12 --> 00:35:16.32
annotated, annotating like a proud tour guide. He explained the different people who lived there,

318
00:35:16.32 --> 00:35:21.92
and where they were all from. He explained how they had been confronted with the same vicious enemy,

319
00:35:21.92 --> 00:35:27.20
and how they coped in different ways. Some ISIS we knew, Abdulla said,

320
00:35:27.20 --> 00:35:33.12
some of our neighbors became ISIS too. I did not know then that such a phrase would be repeated

321
00:35:33.12 --> 00:35:38.16
time and time again as the years went on. I did not realize then the importance of that phrase.

322
00:35:39.84 --> 00:35:46.000
The clef's and all the conspiracies that would come from it. That one phrase would come to

323
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.32
represent the fissures of a country that I wasn't sure could ever be put back together. Our neighbors

324
00:35:52.32 --> 00:35:58.56
became ISIS too. You know, the something that I failed to do as I put these notes together is

325
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.36
is you, throughout the book, you pick these characters and you revisit them.

326
00:36:05.36 --> 00:36:09.76
And I get some of them, but I don't get all of them. I'm not sure if I get back to Abdulla,

327
00:36:10.64 --> 00:36:15.28
but that's what you do. As people hear me talk about these different characters,

328
00:36:15.28 --> 00:36:22.08
look, the book is 450 pages long. If people are wondering, oh, I wonder what happened to that

329
00:36:22.08 --> 00:36:27.28
kid or what happened to that character, many of the characters that you become close with,

330
00:36:27.28 --> 00:36:33.52
you revisit over the years. And as I said, the length of the book is five years or four or four

331
00:36:33.52 --> 00:36:38.88
and a half years, something like that. There's a lot. I mean, think of a kid that's 10 years old becomes

332
00:36:38.88 --> 00:36:43.68
14. That's a big difference. And obviously there are also our characters that

333
00:36:43.68 --> 00:36:53.28
you never see again. And God knows what happens to them. Fast forward a little bit here. The

334
00:36:53.28 --> 00:36:59.68
soldiers at the Mazul Dam greeted us warmly. The Peshmerga began and this, I'm giving everyone a background

335
00:36:59.68 --> 00:37:03.52
in Peshmerga, what you do and look, you give all kinds of nice little history lessons in here, too.

336
00:37:03.52 --> 00:37:09.12
The Peshmerga began as something of a mountain militia in the 1920s when the push for Kurdish

337
00:37:09.12 --> 00:37:14.56
independence began. In recent decades, they had faced unrelenting persecution from the bath

338
00:37:14.56 --> 00:37:21.68
loyalist and of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, one Peshmerga fighter told me they don't

339
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:26.80
suffer from psychological issues pertaining to combat because they have grown up around fighting

340
00:37:26.80 --> 00:37:32.72
and have developed an early understanding that it is just what we have to do to them PTSD

341
00:37:32.72 --> 00:37:40.96
was something of a first world phenomenon. We worked with Kurdish soldiers sometimes in the Iraqi

342
00:37:40.96 --> 00:37:48.56
Army and they were just really good and they just were really good. They have that's why that's what

343
00:37:48.56 --> 00:37:53.60
they do. They grow up fighting. That's sort of their thing. It's like when you're in the US military

344
00:37:53.60 --> 00:38:02.80
and you meet someone that's from Wyoming and they grew up hunting and living out in the land

345
00:38:02.80 --> 00:38:06.16
and they're going to be good soldiers. That's just how it is. Somebody from Alabama that grew up in the

346
00:38:06.16 --> 00:38:10.64
woods, they're going to be a good soldier. That's just how it is. That's how you feel about the

347
00:38:10.64 --> 00:38:13.60
Kurds. That's how I always felt about the Kurds. And just because they say they don't

348
00:38:13.60 --> 00:38:18.88
self-fulfirm any psychological problems doesn't mean they don't. And that's just a very different

349
00:38:18.88 --> 00:38:23.68
relationship that they have with it. And not just the Peshmega but in a lot of the, you know, in

350
00:38:23.68 --> 00:38:27.20
the Middle East and those in the armies and things it's just not something that they

351
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.56
acknowledge or really talk about. Yeah, in many ways it's something that we haven't talked about

352
00:38:35.44 --> 00:38:39.84
up until these reap most recent wars. Yep. Even though it's always been there,

353
00:38:41.92 --> 00:38:46.88
you continue on here. The Peshmega soldiers range from around 18 to more than 70 years old with many

354
00:38:46.88 --> 00:38:52.88
coming out of retirement in the quest to defeat ISIS threat. During days of intense conflict,

355
00:38:52.88 --> 00:38:56.56
the Peshmega are lucky to return to their base for two or three hours of sleep and a quick

356
00:38:56.56 --> 00:39:02.16
bite to eat before venturing back to their fighting locus. As it's due to a prominent portion of

357
00:39:02.16 --> 00:39:07.20
the fighters are not soldiers but what they call security advisors who don't take a salary and volunteer

358
00:39:07.20 --> 00:39:13.20
simply out of devotion. There are special forces that have been arranged for these people.

359
00:39:13.20 --> 00:39:17.20
They don't register their names and don't sign contracts. They just want to serve and Kurdistan.

360
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:27.68
One Peshmega soldier explained how ISIS commanders often drug young fighters with special

361
00:39:27.68 --> 00:39:32.72
tablets that leave them disoriented and shooting wildly into the night. Sometimes they were able

362
00:39:32.72 --> 00:39:37.12
to keep going despite being shot several times taking upwards of 20 bullets before they went down.

363
00:39:38.32 --> 00:39:41.04
For those who survive and that's been referenced the ISIS fighters,

364
00:39:41.04 --> 00:39:44.48
when they realize what they've done, they sometimes regret it.

365
00:39:49.92 --> 00:39:56.64
And you say here, almost every Kurd wants to share their history. History of their people and

366
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:01.44
their oppression. But the string that could be weaved through and through was that they did not expect

367
00:40:01.44 --> 00:40:05.84
to be granted freedom for nothing. They knew they would have to fight for every fight for it every

368
00:40:05.84 --> 00:40:11.12
step of the way. The secession of let downs, of losses and gains was all part of their rough climb

369
00:40:11.12 --> 00:40:17.52
up the rope of revolution. At the top they would find their independence. When they referred to

370
00:40:17.52 --> 00:40:21.84
their soldiers killed on the battlefield, they sometimes said that they were martyred and sometimes

371
00:40:21.84 --> 00:40:27.76
said that they were murdered. I wondered how differently Americans would see wars if the press

372
00:40:27.76 --> 00:40:32.56
and the people spoke of our troops in the firing line as having died in a homicide rather than

373
00:40:32.56 --> 00:40:39.28
killed an action. And now you reflect on this battle that had taken place. The rain fell harder,

374
00:40:39.28 --> 00:40:45.20
the bullets flew wildly into the growing darkness that hid the dead ISIS bodies nearby.

375
00:40:45.20 --> 00:40:52.24
Hungry, untamed dogs had gouged into the skeletons almost immediately. Some had been dead for days.

376
00:40:52.96 --> 00:40:57.44
Some had names and others had been left nameless. Some,

377
00:40:57.44 --> 00:41:09.52
maculated by the creatures howling at the moon, had no faces. So you jump right into this stuff

378
00:41:09.52 --> 00:41:14.96
with, I mean this battle that's taking place up at the muzzle dam, you're seeing the ISIS fighters.

379
00:41:16.88 --> 00:41:23.20
This is a long way from Paris Hilton's Malibu beach parties, I guess. Definitely.

380
00:41:23.20 --> 00:41:29.76
And when I first went, you know, I didn't go with the intention of of going to the front lines.

381
00:41:30.56 --> 00:41:36.80
I really went with the intention of trying to understand, I guess the human cost of war and I really

382
00:41:36.80 --> 00:41:41.92
just wanted to go and talk to people that lived there. I wanted to understand what it was like to

383
00:41:41.92 --> 00:41:48.48
be a displaced person, what it was like to sort of have everything and then have nothing.

384
00:41:48.48 --> 00:41:56.48
And I just happened to sort of make a good connection through somebody and then when I went to meet him,

385
00:41:57.20 --> 00:42:05.20
it was a crazy story. He came and picked us up. The car got stuck in the mud and there was sort of

386
00:42:05.20 --> 00:42:10.24
a lot of fighting going on and we sort of had to go into a different direction and then we ended up

387
00:42:10.24 --> 00:42:14.08
sort of on the front lines. It wasn't something that even really planned and I'm sure my boss

388
00:42:14.08 --> 00:42:20.32
would have had a heart attack if I sort of told them in advance. But yeah, it was a it was a night

389
00:42:20.32 --> 00:42:27.76
very eye opening and even when I I guess the times that I've spent with the Peshmerga with other

390
00:42:27.76 --> 00:42:31.68
soldiers, Iraqi soldiers on the front line, it's always still being that same theme for me

391
00:42:32.24 --> 00:42:38.24
of wanting to get that human cost. So I'm much more interested in in those stories, I guess,

392
00:42:38.24 --> 00:42:43.28
from my perspective than what we call the Bang Bang. It's what journalists usually call that,

393
00:42:43.28 --> 00:42:48.96
the sort of the more military aspect of it. I want to understand who they were, who their families were.

394
00:42:49.68 --> 00:42:54.32
What their motivation for being there was, as you said, it's, you know, these people coming out

395
00:42:54.32 --> 00:43:00.72
and volunteering and then not getting paid and they're bringing their AK47 from home and they don't

396
00:43:00.72 --> 00:43:06.80
really have much more beyond that. And I just that to me was fascinating. What is it? What is motivating you?

397
00:43:06.80 --> 00:43:12.72
What is driving you? What? What are you sacrificing to do this and do you plan to just keep doing this

398
00:43:12.72 --> 00:43:17.60
over and over again? And I think for me that was always the question that I was trying to

399
00:43:19.60 --> 00:43:22.32
trying to understand, trying to piece together in my head.

400
00:43:24.48 --> 00:43:28.24
Yeah, and as I'm sitting here thinking about you on the front lines for the first time,

401
00:43:28.24 --> 00:43:34.24
sort of and then going back to the conversation we had about being naive and I just,

402
00:43:34.24 --> 00:43:37.92
I just remembered a conversation. First of all, I've had this conversation with a bunch of

403
00:43:37.92 --> 00:43:44.88
veterans, but the one that came to my mind was a guy by the name of Dean Ladd, who is a

404
00:43:44.88 --> 00:43:54.48
Marine in World War II who went on the island campaign and he was going into Tahrua as a Marine,

405
00:43:55.60 --> 00:43:58.56
as a Marine, Paltoon Commander or a Company Commander, I forget which.

406
00:43:59.44 --> 00:44:04.64
But I, there was, this was an insane operation. They could tell it was going to be insane.

407
00:44:04.64 --> 00:44:09.92
You know, they're going to storm the beaches where the Japanese had been dug in for three years.

408
00:44:09.92 --> 00:44:13.60
And he did this over and over again. But I, you know, I said, well, did you think anything might

409
00:44:13.60 --> 00:44:18.000
happen to you? He said, no, that's always going to happen to the other guy, which is what everybody thinks,

410
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.60
creatures what everybody thinks. And you know, that's what I think, you know, that's probably going

411
00:44:23.60 --> 00:44:28.24
to happen to somebody else, but not me. Yeah. And I think just, I guess by nature, you know, with a lot of

412
00:44:28.24 --> 00:44:34.40
journalists, whether they've had, you know, tremendous years behind them doing this or not, it's, I guess it's

413
00:44:34.40 --> 00:44:41.28
that same notion of, you know, we're not working for the government, we're not working for anyone in

414
00:44:41.28 --> 00:44:48.48
particular, you know, beyond our organizations. And so you sort of have this kind of strange freedom.

415
00:44:48.48 --> 00:44:54.24
Now, what it's telling you what to do, you know, and, and, and, and for me, I guess I really

416
00:44:54.24 --> 00:45:00.88
want to take advantage of that and, and just, yeah, I remember one time being it, um, did you

417
00:45:00.88 --> 00:45:06.08
have a good at tauging your face? Just that's not a bad guy. I think I flew through there, but I never

418
00:45:06.08 --> 00:45:10.08
spent any more time. I spent a bit of time there and I was with the Aussie, and then I was supposed

419
00:45:10.08 --> 00:45:15.60
to go to Ellisad on the, at the Marine Base there, and there was just dust storm after dust

420
00:45:15.60 --> 00:45:19.60
storms. Every flight was getting canceled. I was like, I just want to go back to Baghdad. I was

421
00:45:19.60 --> 00:45:25.68
trying to get an interview with Saadar, and I, which just, let's just go to Baghdad, and I couldn't

422
00:45:25.68 --> 00:45:30.32
get back to Baghdad. And so I was literally just calling a cab from Taji to like, come and get

423
00:45:30.32 --> 00:45:35.04
me, so I could drive back to my hotel and meet my fixer and Baghdad. I remember the Aussie's is standing

424
00:45:35.04 --> 00:45:42.64
and I'm going, you'll just crazy, and then it's so really jealous. I was like, yeah, I can, I can do that.

425
00:45:42.64 --> 00:45:47.60
Yeah, and what's interesting going back to the earlier conversation, if you were to take a

426
00:45:47.60 --> 00:45:54.96
convoy back from there to Baghdad, you would probably be a great risk. Much greater risk than if you

427
00:45:54.96 --> 00:45:59.60
were in a cab on Orange and White Opal, Freaking Taxi Cab that are driving all over the place.

428
00:45:59.60 --> 00:46:04.08
Yeah, and I, I would do that through rock. I remember going through like all these Iranian

429
00:46:04.08 --> 00:46:09.68
militia checkpoints, and I was, would be in these, Yazidi cars with a baby on my lap, pretending

430
00:46:09.68 --> 00:46:15.68
I was a Yazidi. You know, put the scarf over my head, there's a baby in my lap. I think I managed

431
00:46:15.68 --> 00:46:21.20
to get through about 100 of these Iranian chia checkpoints and not one of them questioned me.

432
00:46:22.16 --> 00:46:26.96
And I remember just getting out of that being like, oh, I had, and I know of other journalists,

433
00:46:26.96 --> 00:46:32.48
I knew a couple of people and they, they got busted a checkpoints and turned around or turned in

434
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:38.000
or whatever it was and, and for me that was going under the radar. I got to where I needed to be.

435
00:46:38.56 --> 00:46:44.48
Had I even got the the checkpoint permission slips that you're supposed to get? I wouldn't have

436
00:46:44.48 --> 00:46:50.16
gotten through. So sometimes you just got to not play by the rules. Under the radar, that's the theme.

437
00:46:52.24 --> 00:46:57.28
I got one more, maybe it's not the last one, but earlier in the book, there are some history lessons,

438
00:46:57.28 --> 00:47:03.20
like I said, even though most of the book is more just interviews with people and what you're actually

439
00:47:03.20 --> 00:47:08.64
saying, this is a little history lesson on March 17th, 1988, the morning after Saddam Hussein's

440
00:47:08.64 --> 00:47:14.88
bath party unleashed a tirade of chemical weapons and killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds in the city of

441
00:47:14.88 --> 00:47:21.92
Hullab, Hullab. So how much are you? Hullab, a few brave photojournalists have ventured into the

442
00:47:21.92 --> 00:47:27.12
city to ensure the brutal dictators atrocities would be documented and exposed to the world.

443
00:47:28.40 --> 00:47:33.28
And you're, you're now interacting with one of them. Accrum looked at me shyly extending his hand.

444
00:47:33.28 --> 00:47:40.80
Nearly 27 years later, he was working at the memorial site known as the Hullab-Jum Monument and

445
00:47:40.80 --> 00:47:47.04
Peace Museum constructed in 2003. On the anniversary of the attack in 2006, residents,

446
00:47:47.04 --> 00:47:52.32
thousands of residents rioted at the site, protesting what they thought was to be capitalizing

447
00:47:52.32 --> 00:47:57.92
on the tragedy and misusing aid funds destroying many of the archives. The monument was rebuilt

448
00:47:57.92 --> 00:48:05.12
into a hub of reflection and solace poised against the serene Iranian mountain side with several

449
00:48:05.12 --> 00:48:10.56
abandoned bath party tanks sitting idly to one side inside the iconic photographs taken

450
00:48:10.56 --> 00:48:15.84
in the pallet aftermath of the attacks had been recreated as life-sized images and statues.

451
00:48:16.24 --> 00:48:20.80
A mother clutching her dead bite baby, lifeless children strewn across pavements.

452
00:48:23.12 --> 00:48:27.76
And here's Acrum talking, we need to remind the new generation about what happened to

453
00:48:27.76 --> 00:48:32.24
this town and we need to keep reminding them so that it doesn't happen again.

454
00:48:35.28 --> 00:48:40.000
Sometimes I can't stop crying. Every day I look at the pictures and I am reminded that it is

455
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.36
my family in those pictures and quote, there was such a depth of sadness in the way he shared

456
00:48:47.36 --> 00:48:53.68
a story constantly relieving a cursed history. Sodom had ordered the chemical attack,

457
00:48:53.68 --> 00:48:59.92
amid the Iran Iraq war following intel reports that Iranian soldiers had been implanted inside

458
00:48:59.92 --> 00:49:08.000
the Kurdish city. Acrum still didn't seem quite sure how or why his life was spared,

459
00:49:08.56 --> 00:49:14.96
or why he was the only survivor within the proximate area. He recalled having instinctively placed

460
00:49:14.96 --> 00:49:19.36
his mother's scarf around his mouth for protection the moment something fell wrong.

461
00:49:19.36 --> 00:49:26.64
He recalled throwing up blood into the scarf which still smelled of his mother even though she was dead

462
00:49:26.64 --> 00:49:34.16
beside him. He recalled the way the vision blurred slowly fading into blackness.

463
00:49:35.44 --> 00:49:41.20
He remembered cars rolling over bodies as other victims in their last few minutes on earth

464
00:49:41.20 --> 00:49:48.80
vomited chunks of green. Some were visibly burning. Their skin boiling with bubbles.

465
00:49:50.80 --> 00:50:00.000
Others laughed uncontrollably an e-reside effect of the lethal chemical cocktail of VX, VX,

466
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:17.52
Seren Taboon and mustard gas. That's a chilling vision. What kind of health was this guy in now?

467
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:25.68
Was he scarred? Yeah, he definitely. He was well, it's looked normal but

468
00:50:25.68 --> 00:50:31.04
there was something about him. I can't put my finger on it but there was definitely something that

469
00:50:31.04 --> 00:50:44.32
that wasn't quite right. Fast forward a little bit. There's a section called the faces of evil.

470
00:50:44.88 --> 00:50:50.08
This is November 2014. Some ISIS soldiers will tell you that the reason they joined

471
00:50:50.08 --> 00:50:56.08
were simple. Straight forward woven into the web of basic survival money protection food.

472
00:50:56.48 --> 00:51:00.24
Other times the reasons to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group were complex,

473
00:51:00.24 --> 00:51:05.44
deep-seated in sectarian tribal and historical grievances dating back centuries.

474
00:51:07.84 --> 00:51:16.000
So what is war? War is a composite of individual stories and reasons. One rarely the same as the

475
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.56
other. I pointed out the introduction that you asked this question over and over again more times than

476
00:51:20.56 --> 00:51:28.000
I read. Maybe that's the first time you asked to ask the question. But what's interesting about

477
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.40
that answer to composite of individual stories and reasons. That's what this book is.

478
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:38.32
It's like you're compiling all these different perspectives that people have, what they've been

479
00:51:38.32 --> 00:51:46.000
through and how they ended up here. Did you have that intent? When did this work that you were doing

480
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.96
start to formulate in your head as a congruent story that you could put together in a book?

481
00:51:51.60 --> 00:51:57.20
It's something I guess. It's like most of this book was written handwritten in notebooks.

482
00:51:57.20 --> 00:52:00.48
So you can imagine how many of those are sitting in storage right now.

483
00:52:00.48 --> 00:52:09.28
But yeah, I think from sort of the first in 2014, I was trying to craft together how I wanted

484
00:52:09.28 --> 00:52:15.20
to weave these stories and how to make it a bigger story. And I knew that I didn't want to write

485
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:21.20
something that was political, a policy driven or I just I didn't feel that that was my job as a

486
00:52:21.20 --> 00:52:29.84
journalist. I wasn't here to change laws. I wasn't here to to become or to be a court-on-quote expert

487
00:52:29.84 --> 00:52:35.92
in anything. My job was to tell a story. That was what I knew and that's what I knew that I could do.

488
00:52:36.56 --> 00:52:40.80
And so for me it was it was early on that I started to shape that idea and I didn't quite know

489
00:52:41.84 --> 00:52:48.24
how to put it together and then I guess around 20 and of 2015, I thought, you know, this is the

490
00:52:48.24 --> 00:52:52.96
approach I want to take with it. I really have to be patient because you're going to have to stick

491
00:52:52.96 --> 00:52:57.92
this out for a few more years. This isn't something that you can work on in finishing the next

492
00:52:57.92 --> 00:53:04.24
couple of months. So I had to give myself a good lesson, lesson in patience and just continue to

493
00:53:04.24 --> 00:53:10.000
just spend the next few years just going back and forth and spending as much time as I possibly

494
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.68
could on the ground. And then I guess I felt that I had an and I could have kept going. That was

495
00:53:15.68 --> 00:53:19.28
the thing. I just I could have kept going. I could be there now and keep going. And still have

496
00:53:19.28 --> 00:53:24.88
these incredible stories. But at some point I had to realize, okay, you need to stop. And

497
00:53:24.88 --> 00:53:29.04
you know, there are other things you need to do there. The place is you need to focus, but there

498
00:53:29.04 --> 00:53:35.76
also has to be beginning and then into this. So yeah, I guess it was sort of 2019 that I decided that

499
00:53:35.76 --> 00:53:40.88
I think I had enough to put some together. But have you ever read Hiroshima?

500
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:49.84
No. Oh, it's one of the most incredible incredible books about Japan and it was a journalist who

501
00:53:49.84 --> 00:53:54.88
had gone back and he was telling story, these individual stories decades after it. And it had such a

502
00:53:54.88 --> 00:54:00.88
lasting effect on me growing up and that was sort of, I guess, one of the biggest motivations in

503
00:54:00.88 --> 00:54:08.80
the style that I took with it was again that human cost and then just telling the very narrative

504
00:54:08.80 --> 00:54:15.84
story from as many perspectives as possible. And it's much detail as I possibly could as well.

505
00:54:15.84 --> 00:54:21.52
And I think that was something I wanted to bring out was it's those small details that make up the

506
00:54:21.52 --> 00:54:29.60
big ones. And I think it's the individual stories that tell a big picture. And sometimes we can

507
00:54:29.60 --> 00:54:35.12
look at statistics and we can look at the things that really distance us from a conflict because

508
00:54:35.12 --> 00:54:40.000
it's really easy to do that. You can say, okay, well, 200 and two people died in that suicide attack.

509
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.24
But you tell a story of one person who died in that suicide attack and it's probably going to

510
00:54:46.24 --> 00:54:52.24
have a much more profound impact on you. And that's what I wanted to drive home was how the individual

511
00:54:52.24 --> 00:54:59.36
stories make up the big story. It's the micro in the macro. Yeah, that's very reflective of

512
00:55:00.24 --> 00:55:06.40
the way I will with this podcast. Of course, do we cover some big, you know, general patents

513
00:55:06.40 --> 00:55:14.24
books, yes, we do, but the majority of the books that we cover on here are written by a Lance Corp or

514
00:55:14.24 --> 00:55:21.44
Corp or a private that's out there in the front lines, carrying a machine gun. Because once again,

515
00:55:21.44 --> 00:55:27.12
when you're talking about what the general saw or what the general did, there's an altitude there.

516
00:55:27.12 --> 00:55:32.88
There's a lack of connection in many cases as to what actually is happening on the ground and

517
00:55:32.88 --> 00:55:39.84
what that looks like down there. So, yeah, you're effort to do that absolutely came through.

518
00:55:39.84 --> 00:55:44.24
And that example of the suicide bombing, yeah, I see a statistic of 222 people were killed in the

519
00:55:44.24 --> 00:55:49.04
suicide bombing. You can read that and you can move on. You can you can read see that headline and

520
00:55:49.84 --> 00:55:53.52
read, you know, what city was in and cool. You got the information you can move on.

521
00:55:53.52 --> 00:55:58.80
When you read about one of those victims, their family, how it's going to impact them,

522
00:55:58.80 --> 00:56:03.44
what mark it's going to leave, how they ended up there in the first place, what their goals and

523
00:56:03.44 --> 00:56:12.16
dreams were like, that's, that's the impact. And by the way, it's not always good.

524
00:56:13.44 --> 00:56:21.44
As is the case here with Omar, back to the book, Omar, 25 year old ISIS fighter from the Iraqi

525
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:30.16
village of Dor Saladin admitted that during ISIS's first month in Mosul, he had killed scores

526
00:56:30.16 --> 00:56:34.48
of his countrymen and foreign contractors on their behalf.

527
00:56:36.40 --> 00:56:41.12
Quote, they came to our area and forced me to protect their lands. Omar said,

528
00:56:41.12 --> 00:56:46.72
flatly of his ISIS commanders, his thick monobrow remaining frightening still, a physical manifestation

529
00:56:46.72 --> 00:56:52.40
of the emotionless figure before me. After a while, they told me, when are you going to start

530
00:56:52.40 --> 00:56:58.40
protecting your own land? His eyes burning into mine, he went on to describe the words of his

531
00:56:58.40 --> 00:57:03.44
superiors. They told me to do it or die and then they killed people in front of me.

532
00:57:05.12 --> 00:57:11.44
By his count, he had racked up 70 executions in a matter of months. He mandated that he

533
00:57:11.44 --> 00:57:16.96
killed his victims with rifle shots and was chillingly candid about why he did it.

534
00:57:26.24 --> 00:57:32.24
Yeah, it's fascinating that you're sitting face to face with these these individuals.

535
00:57:32.24 --> 00:57:37.60
And obviously, you have a knack for getting people to talk because throughout the book,

536
00:57:37.60 --> 00:57:43.52
you're getting people to explain things to them to you that are either an incredibly painful

537
00:57:44.08 --> 00:57:51.12
or be incriminating like that. Somehow you're getting these people to talk at some very impressive.

538
00:57:54.16 --> 00:57:58.24
You'd be surprised how many people want to platform, you know, get them to talk and

539
00:58:00.24 --> 00:58:04.08
and often I think a lot of it came down to, they just hadn't talked to anyone for a while,

540
00:58:04.08 --> 00:58:08.40
so they were ready to talk to someone and they wanted to tell their story and you get them going

541
00:58:08.40 --> 00:58:15.60
for a minute and they're spilling their life to you because they've been locked up or whatever the

542
00:58:15.60 --> 00:58:22.08
situation is and people like to listen to themselves speak and that's what I've certainly found

543
00:58:22.08 --> 00:58:26.80
in interviewing a number of different jihadists and they want to talk.

544
00:58:28.80 --> 00:58:33.92
You say here, the facilities director of security noted that most ISIS fighters were uneducated

545
00:58:33.92 --> 00:58:39.44
and easily led down the grizzly path of violent jihad. Some regret their actions, some do not

546
00:58:39.44 --> 00:58:45.36
the guard said to me earlier, nonchalantly, understand that most are young and have no information.

547
00:58:45.36 --> 00:58:52.96
They are impressionable. They listen to the second life paradise story, 72 virgins, rivers of wine,

548
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:55.76
and staying young forever. That is all they know.

549
00:58:55.76 --> 00:59:06.48
And you look, there's so many interviews in here with all these different people who you've

550
00:59:06.48 --> 00:59:13.68
got to get the book to read food them, they're powerful. I guess I got drawn into this section,

551
00:59:13.68 --> 00:59:19.28
a star spangled love. The notion of giving thanks to the Red White and Blue was not lost on the

552
00:59:19.28 --> 00:59:25.28
people of Kurdistan. The bald eagle, old glory and the almighty American dollar were king and the

553
00:59:25.28 --> 00:59:30.48
Kurdish part of Iraq. Most ethnic Kurds did not hide their affection for the US, a concept that

554
00:59:30.48 --> 00:59:35.28
had become rare in the predominantly anti-American throngs of the Middle East. Shopped,

555
00:59:35.28 --> 00:59:41.68
peddled American flags. US military gear was prized and the local spoke glowingly of the

556
00:59:41.68 --> 00:59:47.52
notion of the nation that they created with removing Saddam Hussein, the dictator who's heavy hand

557
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:52.000
had so often come down on the minority group, clustered into the northern region.

558
00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.80
Imagine if America didn't exist, said a counten, Kurdot Amin Agah, whose home was outfitted with

559
01:00:00.80 --> 01:00:07.44
Israeli-American and Kurdistan flags and who wears a US Army shirt and a Navy seal watch.

560
01:00:08.40 --> 01:00:15.76
Without America, the world would be run by China or Iran. With dui eyes, he turned to me in earnest.

561
01:00:15.76 --> 01:00:21.92
America represents freedom he stressed. Our dream is to be eternally allied to America.

562
01:00:24.96 --> 01:00:30.32
You don't hear a lot about that. Yeah, that was fascinating. When you go, it was this little

563
01:00:30.96 --> 01:00:38.24
pocket of the Kurds in the North. They just loved, they loved both bushes, they, you know,

564
01:00:38.24 --> 01:00:42.80
it was just something that they just, they thought America was the ones to save the day.

565
01:00:42.80 --> 01:00:49.12
Yeah, I mean, you go in and talk about how you're walking through the, like the bizarre has

566
01:00:49.12 --> 01:00:54.72
red white blue has flags called this stuff in there, just pro-America, pro-freedom.

567
01:00:55.44 --> 01:01:00.88
And this is also interesting. Kurds who as a group are overwhelmingly Muslim also portrayed

568
01:01:00.88 --> 01:01:06.48
themselves as more religiously tolerant. Right now I'm working with Muslims, Yazidi Christians,

569
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:12.24
we're all working together, said one high-raking KRG official. They celebrate occasions together.

570
01:01:12.24 --> 01:01:16.16
It's something very beautiful. I have friends who pray and friends who don't. That's not my

571
01:01:16.16 --> 01:01:20.000
problem. That is their choice. That is how the Kurdish people think about religion.

572
01:01:20.88 --> 01:01:26.16
On one early December morning, I saw several Kurds, busily setting up a deck, and decorating,

573
01:01:26.16 --> 01:01:32.16
Christmas trees. Whether it was done in a secular embrace of a foreign religious right or simply

574
01:01:32.16 --> 01:01:37.52
to make guess more comfortable is not clear. We're still new to this, a Kurdish hotel employee

575
01:01:37.52 --> 01:01:42.72
said with a smile, bickering with a coworker on how to decorate the tree, but we love it.

576
01:01:46.80 --> 01:01:55.52
Very tolerant. Yeah. Set-and-up Christmas trees. Yeah. During the, uh, after the 2003,

577
01:01:55.52 --> 01:02:01.04
a rocky vision, they marketed, they had an entire tourism marketing campaign called the other Iraq.

578
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:06.56
And that was sort of how they would try to draw people in to come and visit them,

579
01:02:06.56 --> 01:02:11.12
was this other Iraq. They called themselves. So even though they belong to Iraq,

580
01:02:11.12 --> 01:02:15.12
they tried to be the other. So that was their kind of approach. Beautiful.

581
01:02:18.88 --> 01:02:25.20
Fast forward a little bit. That summer I drifted between displacement camps. The big ones and the

582
01:02:25.20 --> 01:02:30.88
small ones. The ones that were new only just established to accommodate the constant swell of newcomers,

583
01:02:30.88 --> 01:02:36.56
but ones that have been here for years as past wars melted into new wars. Over time the camps

584
01:02:36.56 --> 01:02:41.52
had burdened into little towns of their own, complete with banks and bridal stores and markets

585
01:02:41.52 --> 01:02:51.52
and places to buy home goods and sweaters. What is war? War brings resiliency. It is turning

586
01:02:51.52 --> 01:02:57.60
what feels like a prison into something of a home. What is war? War is running. It is not knowing

587
01:02:57.60 --> 01:03:04.48
what is on the other side. It is being unwelcome in your own home. It is being unwelcome away from your home.

588
01:03:05.92 --> 01:03:12.40
Sometimes war is walking too. One moment here and the next and some no man's land that you could

589
01:03:12.40 --> 01:03:19.12
that could never be home. It was drifting from place to place, both in mind and body.

590
01:03:19.12 --> 01:03:30.48
Crazy to think these camps are set up for so long that they become little villages.

591
01:03:31.68 --> 01:03:38.56
What is really sad is that so many of them still exist. Because I guess it is really out of the main

592
01:03:38.56 --> 01:03:44.64
headlines of the news now, the resources are just there is nothing. The likes of Bessie Murn,

593
01:03:44.64 --> 01:03:51.76
Gazelle, there are still camps just with nothing and no resources. It is almost even a war situation

594
01:03:51.76 --> 01:03:57.76
for so many of the displaced now. It was for them four years ago.

595
01:04:01.20 --> 01:04:06.16
You say here in a small camp designated especially for displaced Christians, a group of men

596
01:04:06.16 --> 01:04:10.80
looked me in the eyes and said certainly that they do not bother trying to read or watch the news

597
01:04:10.80 --> 01:04:23.60
anymore because it was all fraudulent, all lies. As you are hearing that, does that make you think,

598
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:27.92
okay I have to tell the truth. I can only imagine hearing that from your perspective.

599
01:04:27.92 --> 01:04:34.32
Yeah, for them I think they just grown so frustrated. I think when you see such

600
01:04:34.32 --> 01:04:40.64
atrocities happen in the beginning, you really believe that there is no way the world is going to sit there and do nothing.

601
01:04:40.64 --> 01:04:44.000
I mean this is crazy. Somebody is going to do something, someone is going to stop this.

602
01:04:45.20 --> 01:04:52.88
And then you reach a point. A year in maybe it is 18 months in. When you realize it is not,

603
01:04:52.88 --> 01:04:57.84
well it is not that simple but it is just not the situation is not changing. And so for them I think

604
01:04:57.84 --> 01:05:02.24
that was just the acceptance that the news was never going to help them. Nobody was ever going to

605
01:05:02.24 --> 01:05:08.32
help them and so they come to that sort of group rationale of they mustn't be telling the truth.

606
01:05:08.32 --> 01:05:13.60
Because if they weren't telling the truth and this wouldn't be happening. If the world knew

607
01:05:13.60 --> 01:05:18.96
what was really happening, it would have been stopped by now. So therefore it must be all lies.

608
01:05:21.60 --> 01:05:27.44
How much do you think these stories get lost because of the short attention span of the world?

609
01:05:27.44 --> 01:05:35.76
I think very lost. I think very lost which is why I guess I wanted to try to put it at least together as

610
01:05:35.76 --> 01:05:44.16
one cohesive unit. The attention span is short but I think it's always been telling foreign

611
01:05:44.16 --> 01:05:50.48
stories has always been difficult. I talked to journalists covering walls in the 90s with,

612
01:05:51.52 --> 01:05:55.44
with Bosnia or in other places and they said the same thing. It was Princess Diana did something

613
01:05:55.44 --> 01:06:00.80
and it would take the headlines. And then for me it was sort of something would happen,

614
01:06:00.80 --> 01:06:05.36
Kim Kardashian breaking the internet and that would take the headlines. And so I think it's always a

615
01:06:05.36 --> 01:06:13.28
thing where no matter what error that you were in that foreign news unfortunately isn't going to

616
01:06:13.28 --> 01:06:18.48
always be at the top but that doesn't mean we don't report on it. That doesn't mean we don't give

617
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:24.88
it resources. That doesn't mean we don't tell a story. And for me that was what I was drawn to

618
01:06:24.88 --> 01:06:32.72
was the stories that I felt needed to be told. Whether they have an impact or not that that is

619
01:06:32.72 --> 01:06:42.72
out of my hands but those voices deserve to be heard. This is a good segue into this section

620
01:06:42.72 --> 01:06:53.04
which is entitled Don't Forget Us. Early one morning I ventured further north to visit a

621
01:06:53.04 --> 01:06:59.28
Yazidi camp stuffed into the wedge where Syria, Iraq and Turkey converge. As it came into view over

622
01:06:59.28 --> 01:07:06.40
hilltops, a wash with a midst of equity. Err, I ascertained a sense of something profoundly exhausting.

623
01:07:07.04 --> 01:07:12.72
What struck me most was that unlike other camps where people animatedly voiced their anger

624
01:07:12.72 --> 01:07:18.08
and wailed about the lack of water sharing conspiracy theories about who was really behind ISIS

625
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:23.52
and detailing what had happened to them in the flashes after they realized they could no longer stay.

626
01:07:23.52 --> 01:07:32.88
The Yazidis were so grieved that they said very little. They did not complain. They just looked at

627
01:07:32.88 --> 01:07:40.96
me with wide eyes that could brand even the most stoic of souls. They all spoke softly,

628
01:07:40.96 --> 01:07:45.84
repeating that they all they wanted was for their family members to return and for the chance to go home.

629
01:07:45.84 --> 01:07:51.52
Every single person had either lost a family member to death or disappearance or had been

630
01:07:51.52 --> 01:07:56.88
mained when ISIS assaulted their village less than a year earlier. It did not make sense for

631
01:07:56.88 --> 01:08:06.56
them to complain to complain would be a waste of their precious energy. I was escorted into

632
01:08:06.56 --> 01:08:12.40
a tent where a thin woman had burrowed herself into the corner, weeping silently into a black

633
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:21.20
scarf, shoulders trembling. She was a survivor of sex slavery. She was alive but she was hardly

634
01:08:21.20 --> 01:08:27.28
living. More girls and women tipped toad into the tent behind me, nobody wanted to speak of this

635
01:08:27.28 --> 01:08:35.76
ordeal the notion of being touched. The term sex slave is a controversial one, many to cry,

636
01:08:35.76 --> 01:08:41.28
that it should not be used that it was not politically correct, nor accurate, an argument which I

637
01:08:41.28 --> 01:08:45.92
hear and understand. But I have chosen to use it because it is a term that many of the survivors

638
01:08:45.92 --> 01:08:52.48
and families use and because it's blunt and embedded in the reality that is not the reality that we want.

639
01:08:53.92 --> 01:08:59.52
Speaking of rape was taboo that terrifying within the closed and staunchly conservative Yazidi

640
01:08:59.52 --> 01:09:07.36
community, although the silence was slowly shifting. But there inside that suffocating space,

641
01:09:07.36 --> 01:09:12.16
the women held each other up, their embraces reassuring each other that they were now safe,

642
01:09:12.16 --> 01:09:18.000
if only for that moment in time. And at that moment in time I understood that the most valuable

643
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000
thing I owned was my 99 cent notebook with which I could try to capture the plight of these survivors

644
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.08
in hopes that somehow they would not tumble from the world's oblivion. It was with my notebook

645
01:09:30.08 --> 01:09:35.04
that I could recall and write things these women taught me what it meant to be extraordinary.

646
01:09:35.04 --> 01:09:43.12
What it meant to be brave, what it meant to lose everything and still find the internal spark

647
01:09:44.56 --> 01:09:45.28
to go on.

648
01:09:45.28 --> 01:10:06.32
We'll get into more of the Yazidi treatment. I mean it's just a genocide slash.

649
01:10:06.32 --> 01:10:12.88
I mean the ISIS viewed them as Satan worshippers. Yeah devil worshippers.

650
01:10:17.60 --> 01:10:26.40
Other end of the spectrum. This section stood out to me. One evening I met emerging

651
01:10:26.40 --> 01:10:35.92
pop star, Haley love for tea and hookah in the lounge, hookah in the lounge of an ups of the upscale rotana hotel in

652
01:10:35.92 --> 01:10:41.36
Urbio. She was dolled up to the nines with long, perfect bleached hair extensions, fake eyelashes,

653
01:10:41.36 --> 01:10:47.12
red lips and strappy stilettos that clashed with her camouflage military pants and loose fitting white

654
01:10:47.12 --> 01:10:53.68
top. By recording techno-driven energy boosting tunes to increase morale and filming music

655
01:10:53.68 --> 01:10:59.12
videos in the direct line of fire, Haley was doing what she considered to be her part in the fight,

656
01:10:59.12 --> 01:11:02.72
standing vehemently with the soldiers and their will to win.

657
01:11:03.60 --> 01:11:06.48
Much had been said and speculated about Haley's personal life.

658
01:11:07.36 --> 01:11:11.92
And I wasn't quite sure what to expect but what I found was a true girl's girl. Underneath the

659
01:11:11.92 --> 01:11:17.52
hairspray and larger than life persona, Haley was a self-assured young woman who sought only to use

660
01:11:17.52 --> 01:11:21.20
her stardom and musical talents for something more than milking the Hollywood machine.

661
01:11:21.20 --> 01:11:27.52
I mean, some say I used to be, I used the Peshmerga to further my own fame but people were always

662
01:11:27.52 --> 01:11:32.88
complained she said bluntly in her sharply accented English, flicking a perfectly manicured hand.

663
01:11:32.88 --> 01:11:37.36
My country is bleeding and my weapon is my voice and my music and for those who have had their

664
01:11:37.36 --> 01:11:42.72
voices shot, I felt this was my only way of bringing their story, the story of the Kurdish people

665
01:11:42.72 --> 01:11:43.36
to the world.

666
01:11:43.36 --> 01:11:56.32
Haley love. I love Haley's love. She was born in Iran, became a refugee, ended up in Finland,

667
01:11:56.88 --> 01:12:05.76
from there, got put into a music school of some kind and then the lower of Hollywood got a

668
01:12:05.76 --> 01:12:11.36
holdover. She says this very quickly, I saw the E so she ends up in Hollywood. She literally

669
01:12:11.36 --> 01:12:19.04
was living in Hollywood. I think she got signed to one of the big labels, I think dream or one of

670
01:12:19.04 --> 01:12:25.68
those big producers had signed her and then what happens is you often get sort of shelved away

671
01:12:25.68 --> 01:12:33.04
and then she really really shelved away. The labels will sign you and offer you a deal and then

672
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:38.48
they actually just don't you never get kind of to actually release and so once the contract is

673
01:12:38.48 --> 01:12:42.56
out, you can kind of move on. So I think I'm not sure of all her details but I think she

674
01:12:42.56 --> 01:12:47.52
was sort of brought over here and it was sort of starry eye and then nothing kind of moved and she

675
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:51.60
really saw the end of the belly of of water what Hollywood was.

676
01:12:51.60 --> 01:12:55.20
Yeah, she said that she said I met some producers and realize that what they were offering

677
01:12:55.20 --> 01:12:59.68
an exchange to promote me was a lie. It was all about sex. It was shocking to me. I gave up

678
01:12:59.68 --> 01:13:10.16
on almost everything. She ends up cutting a couple songs over there. She says straight away,

679
01:13:10.16 --> 01:13:14.56
I received death threats from radical Islamic groups and the mollows at the mosque were insisting

680
01:13:14.56 --> 01:13:21.52
I was a bad influence and should be stoned to death. My life changed. I was the lying girl. I

681
01:13:21.52 --> 01:13:25.76
had all these fans and all the success but I had to contend with this too. You can watch

682
01:13:25.76 --> 01:13:31.12
your videos on YouTube and I'm definitely recommend checking them out. Yeah, something else, right?

683
01:13:32.16 --> 01:13:36.72
Even echo channels would be proud because she has a lot of explosions and she's filming

684
01:13:36.72 --> 01:13:41.76
notes. It's like, yeah, I literally I remember she was filming me and getting you know controversial

685
01:13:41.76 --> 01:13:45.76
some people agree some people won't but yeah, I says this is five miles or something down the road

686
01:13:45.76 --> 01:13:53.76
and she's filming a music video. Yeah, how cheat and you, this is one of the things I don't

687
01:13:53.76 --> 01:13:57.76
really trace but you trace the rest of her story. You go back and visit her at some point. Don't you?

688
01:13:57.76 --> 01:14:02.80
Yeah, so I went back and because yeah, I always wondered and I really, I really love telling

689
01:14:02.80 --> 01:14:08.08
when I met her and so I went back when I was in a meal and her name came up with a friend of mine

690
01:14:08.08 --> 01:14:14.80
there and she'd opened a beauty school or a sort of big beauty salon and everything's very

691
01:14:14.80 --> 01:14:21.68
pink and all the young girls go there for their, you know, their equivalent of the prom and get ready

692
01:14:21.68 --> 01:14:29.04
and and I think she'd really settled into that kind of life of being able to, to be in, you know,

693
01:14:29.04 --> 01:14:34.48
with her people and to do things in a really different way than she did in visions. So yeah,

694
01:14:34.48 --> 01:14:40.24
that was her way of, I guess, giving back in a new evolution was to sort of be the, the,

695
01:14:42.08 --> 01:14:46.96
the motivated for a lot of the, the young girls in sort of the next generation. Yeah, I thought

696
01:14:46.96 --> 01:14:54.16
that was, that was awesome. It's like she, she like, you always hear people going back to your

697
01:14:54.16 --> 01:14:58.40
roots, you know, go back to her, she straight up went back to her roots and she lives there now and

698
01:14:59.28 --> 01:15:08.000
pretty awesome. Yeah. Then she does have some pumped up videos. And she's gorgeous.

699
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:18.88
I'm going to fast forward up to 2016. This brazen attack struck deep when no one was ready for it.

700
01:15:18.88 --> 01:15:23.60
There have been no intelligence warnings and ISIS suicide bomber detonated a checkpoint outside

701
01:15:23.60 --> 01:15:32.80
a small town called DB's near Kirkuk on November 3rd, 2015, allowing three fellow fighters to sneak

702
01:15:32.80 --> 01:15:39.44
through and temporarily commandeer a local government off office. The men were sentenced to hell

703
01:15:39.44 --> 01:15:45.04
and all died in the attack, but the ISIS bomb expert whose handy work sent them to their maker did not.

704
01:15:46.64 --> 01:15:55.28
Jacim Mohamed Atia was being held in a high security prison near the oil rich city in late

705
01:15:55.28 --> 01:16:04.72
January of 2016, the guard's let Jacim blindfolded into the room to meet me. What I did were

706
01:16:04.72 --> 01:16:11.12
terror acts Jacim, the 22-year-old said, matter of factly sitting handcuffed in the small office

707
01:16:11.12 --> 01:16:18.48
in the urbule headquarters of the of Asaya. It was my duty. There are infidel infidel's and there

708
01:16:18.48 --> 01:16:26.48
is instruction in the Quran to stop this and to fight all infidel's. The Kurdish security forces

709
01:16:26.48 --> 01:16:33.20
had nabbed Jacim weeks after the attack that slaughtered 14 Kurds and left scores more wounded.

710
01:16:33.20 --> 01:16:38.64
Three ISIS fighters had used the checkpoint bombing as a diversion to enter the city,

711
01:16:38.64 --> 01:16:43.84
then briefly hold themselves up in the mayor's office. The standoff ended when they opted to

712
01:16:43.84 --> 01:16:49.52
blow their own bodies to bits as police forces closed in. While that attack served as notice that

713
01:16:49.52 --> 01:16:55.12
ISIS was able to strike outside the territory of controlled, the one thwarted by Jacim's capture

714
01:16:55.12 --> 01:17:00.16
would have been devastating by comparison. The Kurdish security officials told me that Jacim

715
01:17:00.56 --> 01:17:06.80
had been preparing to rig a powerful truck bomb bound for urbule when he was arrested by intelligence agents.

716
01:17:06.80 --> 01:17:12.80
Jacim had cried like a big baby when he was seized. One intelligence officer recalled smuggly

717
01:17:12.80 --> 01:17:18.80
and had cried that all of them would be mad at him. The authorities relished any opportunity to

718
01:17:18.80 --> 01:17:23.12
take away the perceived power of ISIS members to bellow that these fighters were nothing more

719
01:17:23.12 --> 01:17:30.48
than pathetic, delusional con artist. The exact number of deaths caused by the exact number of deaths

720
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:36.88
as Jacim caused, whether directly or indirectly remained unclear, he repeatedly gloded about

721
01:17:36.88 --> 01:17:42.000
conducting operations that killed and harmed scores of people, including the fighters he

722
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000
outfitted with suicide vests or put behind the wheels of vehicles rigged to explode. He was

723
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.08
proud of his monstrous work and craftsmanship, but he was by no means ready to be a martyr himself.

724
01:17:54.08 --> 01:18:01.04
When I asked if he would have strapped a vest on of his own. I never thought of killing myself.

725
01:18:01.04 --> 01:18:07.20
I'm not convinced to kill myself. He said on apologetically, actually, I would leave or escape if

726
01:18:07.20 --> 01:18:12.24
they gave me this order. I wouldn't explode myself. That is another level of faith.

727
01:18:14.88 --> 01:18:19.52
He was unconvinced by the Mullahs' routine, espousing the paradise replete with 72

728
01:18:19.52 --> 01:18:25.76
virgins that don't menstruate or defecate. It's our leaders that make decisions Jacim said.

729
01:18:27.52 --> 01:18:33.44
Our scientists are scientists say that there are infidel people in Kirk Cook. It's not my decision.

730
01:18:33.44 --> 01:18:37.76
We are students and we listen to our teachers. If somebody pledges allegiance to ISIS,

731
01:18:37.76 --> 01:18:42.000
they must take orders and do whatever orders they get. They have to do it.

732
01:18:44.08 --> 01:18:48.24
I asked about the scientists and their theoretical determinations of infidel blood,

733
01:18:48.24 --> 01:18:52.64
but he didn't seem to know. Jacim had been taught not to question the scientists. If the

734
01:18:52.64 --> 01:19:00.80
scientists were really scientists. But at the top of ISIS of the Heises hierarchy was Abu Baker al-Baghdadi,

735
01:19:00.80 --> 01:19:06.08
who Jacim described as a good leader who lived as a simple soldier and who was just like everyone

736
01:19:06.08 --> 01:19:10.88
else. He had never met or seen the elusive self-professed ISIS Khalif.

737
01:19:13.60 --> 01:19:17.76
That's dangerous to meet him. No one can see him Jacim said. His eyes widening in surprise

738
01:19:17.76 --> 01:19:21.76
that even suggested such a question. It is prohibited for anybody to see him.

739
01:19:22.64 --> 01:19:28.40
Alternating between Bravado and circumspection brought on by either remorse or the presence of a

740
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:33.92
watchful jailer, Jacim caused that he would have to be convinced not to go back to ISIS if you

741
01:19:33.92 --> 01:19:38.88
were released. Before I went to prison, I had no problems killing people. Now I have a bit of regret

742
01:19:38.88 --> 01:19:47.44
that maybe some people don't deserve to be killed. How long would you sit in a room with these guys

743
01:19:47.44 --> 01:19:53.68
for? I really depended. I think with him it was around about an hour or two hours. So...

744
01:19:53.68 --> 01:19:59.28
How would you select who you would you say, hey, who do you got?

745
01:19:59.28 --> 01:20:05.36
Yeah, I would usually talk to the gods about who was there, who was willing to talk. I always

746
01:20:05.36 --> 01:20:12.24
wanted to make it very clear to them. I was a journalist and their stories were going to be

747
01:20:12.24 --> 01:20:18.24
as they told them and they needed to be. It was difficult because in some cases they hadn't been

748
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:23.84
brought to trial. So, you know, when they're saying these things, you know, and you haven't been brought

749
01:20:23.84 --> 01:20:28.16
to trial yet, you are incriminating yourself to a degree. And so I always wanted to be very

750
01:20:28.16 --> 01:20:34.56
fair and very clear that my journalists and what you say is going to be printed. So their willingness

751
01:20:34.56 --> 01:20:39.20
was obviously a big factor in them coming forward and telling this stories.

752
01:20:39.20 --> 01:20:48.80
Yeah, he also said it's better if they join. We want to go to America. We want to spread our

753
01:20:48.80 --> 01:20:56.32
ideology all over the world. You talk to another guy.

754
01:20:56.32 --> 01:21:09.44
I hear Sahib Jamel by his count, he had killed dozens of uninvolved men, women, and children.

755
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.68
He says at the beginning, I says, told us we would all go to heaven. But now that I'm in prison,

756
01:21:15.68 --> 01:21:21.92
it means I am going to the fire. I am going to hell. The indoctrination was self-fulfilling

757
01:21:21.92 --> 01:21:26.64
fantasy script was evident, but any sign of real remorse was not.

758
01:21:37.92 --> 01:21:44.88
Real quick, when you interview these people, you mentioned that that one guy was blindfolded.

759
01:21:44.88 --> 01:21:49.76
You see blindfolded during the interview as well, are they? They take it off. Yeah, they

760
01:21:49.76 --> 01:21:53.84
blindfolded them and they bring them in so they don't really know where they are.

761
01:21:53.84 --> 01:21:58.56
You know, specific office or whatever they are. They take it off normally.

762
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:04.000
I mean, he was, he asked a lot of articles on, but they took the blindfold off.

763
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.76
That way you're just looking at them in his eyes when he's telling you all this stuff.

764
01:22:08.96 --> 01:22:14.72
At first it is. There's a little bit of a Walmart process and I found in a couple of the

765
01:22:14.72 --> 01:22:19.36
situations where my fixes would get very angry and I would have to ask them to leave or,

766
01:22:19.36 --> 01:22:26.40
you know, because often, you know, it's their relatives, you know, people that are being killed

767
01:22:26.40 --> 01:22:31.84
by these people and they're hate is so strong. Sometimes I felt that I'm not going to get a

768
01:22:31.84 --> 01:22:37.60
greeting if you're right now because, you know, you can feel that animosity and the reason I'm

769
01:22:37.60 --> 01:22:42.64
trying to get them to open up here. So, you know, there was that barrier I had to do with a little

770
01:22:42.64 --> 01:22:46.72
bit in the beginning and then I think as you sort of move into what you kind of get a,

771
01:22:46.72 --> 01:22:52.96
you build that rapport to a degree. They realize you just that to talk to them, to have a

772
01:22:52.96 --> 01:22:58.56
conversation, it's not, it's not my job to, I'm not there to interrogate you. I'm not there to, you

773
01:22:58.56 --> 01:23:04.40
know, to stick it to the man. I'm just there to find out the information. So, once I think they get

774
01:23:06.08 --> 01:23:09.84
used to me a little bit and then, you know, I get used to them a little bit, then it can

775
01:23:10.40 --> 01:23:15.28
become a little bit more of a conversation after that. Is it meant? Would you compare

776
01:23:15.28 --> 01:23:19.04
you know, like the doctors, like a surgeon or something like this and they got to cut some

777
01:23:19.04 --> 01:23:24.16
body open for you. Yeah, like for a normal person, they'd be like, oh, no, if I can't cut this

778
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:29.28
person open. But then, if you're a doctor after a while, it becomes less of, oh, I'm cutting this

779
01:23:29.28 --> 01:23:34.08
person open more like this is like a, you know, like a specimen that I have to like work on kind of

780
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:38.32
thing. Yeah, I think, I mean, there is, there are certain degrees of, that you have to

781
01:23:38.32 --> 01:23:45.76
can't compartmentalize. I think for me, I'm always very cautious of not wanting to do that too much

782
01:23:45.76 --> 01:23:52.64
because I think my, you know, what I'm trying to do is to, to really bring a different level of

783
01:23:52.64 --> 01:23:59.52
understanding on all sides of it and I don't want to be too distant. So, it's a fine balance.

784
01:23:59.52 --> 01:24:05.76
It's sometimes, you know, and sometimes I make it better than others, but, um, yeah, it's really,

785
01:24:05.76 --> 01:24:09.44
it's just listening. Often it's just listening. That's what it comes down to.

786
01:24:09.44 --> 01:24:12.88
Seems like after a while, this, like, all these stories might kind of jam you up.

787
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:19.52
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did get to that point a little bit, but I'd set boundaries on myself

788
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:24.80
to recognize that I think, and yeah, I did get to that point.

789
01:24:25.68 --> 01:24:27.44
When you say you'd set boundaries for yourself,

790
01:24:28.32 --> 01:24:33.36
we'll get you a lot of the pieces that we could use in boundaries. So, I had, I had set

791
01:24:33.36 --> 01:24:38.000
markers on you for myself really, especially because I was, you know, spending so much time in the

792
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.68
stories, we'd just get heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and I would just be living in it,

793
01:24:41.68 --> 01:24:46.48
and I'd be living on a floor somewhere, and I didn't have a team, I didn't, I didn't have people around

794
01:24:46.48 --> 01:24:54.08
me beyond, you know, my fixes and who I was very close to, but I just knew that I, I wouldn't be

795
01:24:54.08 --> 01:24:59.04
able to do my work effectively if something, or I was hearing things that were really

796
01:24:59.04 --> 01:25:06.96
tragic, or something tragic had happened, and I didn't feel anything. And, and that, I think that

797
01:25:06.96 --> 01:25:12.48
moment didn't really come from me during this particular book. I had a couple of moments where

798
01:25:12.48 --> 01:25:17.92
I just, I felt very broken a little bit because I felt so helpless, and that happened during that,

799
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:24.24
but I still managed to feel, you know, everything affected me, and I wanted it to affect

800
01:25:24.24 --> 01:25:29.68
me to a degree. And then when I realized I really need to take a break was sort of several years

801
01:25:29.68 --> 01:25:37.20
after, and it was in Africa and East Africa, and I'd interviewed a woman from the Congo who had

802
01:25:37.20 --> 01:25:42.000
had, you know, sexual violence, and she'd had these babies out of rape, and just what she went through,

803
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.40
was so horrific, and she'd been shunned by her community, and she was running, and she was just

804
01:25:46.40 --> 01:25:51.68
the most extraordinary woman, and she was so, the name was Nancy, and she was so strong and amazing,

805
01:25:51.68 --> 01:25:57.68
and I just remember sitting with her for hours and with these babies, and having that feeling of,

806
01:25:57.68 --> 01:26:03.52
oh my god, I don't, I don't even feel this, I don't, I don't feel anything right now, and that

807
01:26:03.52 --> 01:26:09.76
really bothered me that I didn't feel anything, and so after that trip I went home, and I,

808
01:26:09.76 --> 01:26:15.36
I didn't go anywhere, I don't think for about six or seven months, because I just felt that,

809
01:26:15.36 --> 01:26:20.000
yeah, if I'd got to that point of just not reacting, that was not the point that I wanted to get to,

810
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.60
and that's when you just have to take a break, and that's it. But I think, during the process of this

811
01:26:27.60 --> 01:26:34.56
book, and I talk about a little bit in the book, but it's often, you know, as a as a writer,

812
01:26:34.56 --> 01:26:41.92
I think it's an advantage because you're telling stories, and so it's almost cathodic, so people are

813
01:26:41.92 --> 01:26:48.48
telling you terrible things, and you have a way to release it out of your body, whereas I know a lot of

814
01:26:48.48 --> 01:26:55.60
my colleagues who have photographers or videographers sort of in combat, I think that they suffer more

815
01:26:55.60 --> 01:27:00.000
to be honest, and I've heard this from other journalists, because maybe they're not getting

816
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.92
that same release that I get as a rasha, you know, may or may not be true, but that's sort of my

817
01:27:05.92 --> 01:27:09.76
experience with it, but I know, and I talk about in the book, and it's not always the most obvious

818
01:27:10.96 --> 01:27:16.64
things that I use the word break you, but it's not always, you know, digging up the mass graves,

819
01:27:16.64 --> 01:27:23.20
or seeing somebody be killed, or, you know, they're horrific things, but for me, they want the things

820
01:27:23.20 --> 01:27:29.12
that, you know, shattered me, the things were, and there's one that really sticks out for me,

821
01:27:29.12 --> 01:27:34.64
and that was in, in Xinjiang, in the city, and it had been completely destroyed, and a few of these

822
01:27:34.64 --> 01:27:40.56
very poor people had moved back to live in these houses where there was no water, no electricity,

823
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:47.04
there was nothing, and because they couldn't afford to live at Camp Seven, and so I remember being

824
01:27:47.04 --> 01:27:50.96
there one day and there was a young father, and he had two young children, and he was just living

825
01:27:50.96 --> 01:27:57.04
in his old bummed-out house, even though there was nothing in there, and he said that he, they

826
01:27:57.04 --> 01:28:03.12
were easy, and he said that he's why I could be taking the children's mother, and that the

827
01:28:03.12 --> 01:28:09.36
captured her cold team and said if you give me X amount of dollars, it was several thousand dollars, then,

828
01:28:09.36 --> 01:28:15.20
you know, I would turn her, so this poor guy for months walked around and around the village,

829
01:28:15.20 --> 01:28:20.08
and everybody was trying to give him money, and he's selling his furniture, and, you know, doing

830
01:28:20.08 --> 01:28:25.04
whatever, and he finally comes up with the money, and then he calls the the captor and says, hey,

831
01:28:25.04 --> 01:28:31.28
I've got the money, and he says all of the prices doubled, and at that point, the man just gave

832
01:28:31.28 --> 01:28:35.20
up, he just gave up, he said, I can't, I don't have that, no one else was going to give me any

833
01:28:35.20 --> 01:28:40.40
more money, and so he's sitting over these kids, and I just, and that was the story that really,

834
01:28:40.40 --> 01:28:46.88
really cracks me because I felt so helpless, and I thought I can't even give you money, because

835
01:28:46.88 --> 01:28:52.24
I would be labeled as a, you know, giving, financing a terrorist regime if I did that, because

836
01:28:52.24 --> 01:28:57.36
they're paying ISIS to get their women back, but to him, that was, that was his wife,

837
01:28:57.36 --> 01:29:02.08
that was these children's mother, and just the fact that she's probably not even alive now,

838
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:06.40
because he just could not come up with that money, and he didn't have the resources to do that.

839
01:29:07.52 --> 01:29:12.32
It was just, it was such a helpless feeling, and I, I couldn't help him, and

840
01:29:13.68 --> 01:29:17.60
yeah, that was the moment for me that I was like, this is, this is just insanity.

841
01:29:18.24 --> 01:29:22.40
This is ridiculous, and there's no reason that this should be happening.

842
01:29:22.40 --> 01:29:30.56
I think when you talk about the fact that writing the stories is an outlet, and it's something

843
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:35.28
that I talk about with, even with, from the leadership perspective when I'm talking, the leaders

844
01:29:35.28 --> 01:29:40.64
about how to make decisions, I say, look, when you write something down, you are detaching from it.

845
01:29:40.64 --> 01:29:45.84
It's literally on a piece of paper outside of your head now, and now you can assess it from a different

846
01:29:45.84 --> 01:29:54.56
perspective. So I think that I totally agree that writing is therapeutic because you get it out of

847
01:29:54.56 --> 01:29:59.84
your system, and now you can see it on the page, and you can relate it from a different perspective.

848
01:30:03.04 --> 01:30:08.80
You know, and it's weird, you also talked about the, you know, at a point where you

849
01:30:08.80 --> 01:30:14.88
were in Africa, and you're interviewing this woman, and she's been through this

850
01:30:15.92 --> 01:30:21.92
absolutely unimaginable horror, and she's pressing on, by the way, and she's caring for it,

851
01:30:21.92 --> 01:30:28.48
and you feel like empty, and that's, you describe the Yazidis at many points, at many points of

852
01:30:28.48 --> 01:30:34.56
being in that zone where they just have no more emotions left because they've just gotten

853
01:30:34.56 --> 01:30:41.04
crushed at every single turn. And there was, there was one point there, and they're telling

854
01:30:41.04 --> 01:30:45.28
me the stories and showing me the pictures of these Yazidis babies that were being burned, and I just,

855
01:30:45.28 --> 01:30:50.72
I lost it, and you never want to lose it. You know, especially the journalists, you never want to

856
01:30:50.72 --> 01:30:58.88
cry, you never want to break down, and I just, I, I broke down, and I was just bowling in this room,

857
01:30:58.88 --> 01:31:03.84
and I just remember I looked up, and if somebody was handing me a tissue, they were all men in

858
01:31:03.84 --> 01:31:09.44
the room, Yazidis men, and was with one of their religious leaders. I just looked at everyone of

859
01:31:09.44 --> 01:31:14.48
those faces, and I thought, they didn't even want to just look at me, and he said, we just don't

860
01:31:14.48 --> 01:31:21.92
react anymore. And I just thought, this is just, it's such a, it's a place beyond a place that I

861
01:31:21.92 --> 01:31:26.32
can, you know, thank goodness, can never imagine getting to, or hopefully never would, but

862
01:31:27.36 --> 01:31:32.80
the depths of what they'd endured, the thousands of people from their community that had been taken,

863
01:31:32.80 --> 01:31:39.68
and, and just, it was so hard to even now to wrap my head around, but for them, it was just,

864
01:31:41.44 --> 01:31:46.24
there would be on the point of even reacting to any of it anymore, and they were just so lost,

865
01:31:46.24 --> 01:31:53.68
and so, so broken by it all that I just, nothing was triggering them anymore, and so

866
01:31:53.68 --> 01:31:59.84
here was I feeling terribly unprofessional and crying, but I just, I, I couldn't, I just couldn't

867
01:31:59.84 --> 01:32:06.24
stop, and it was just, yeah, that was a, probably the only time I've really done that, but that was,

868
01:32:07.52 --> 01:32:13.20
yeah, it was just a moment for me, of realizing that here I was feeling terrible, and they weren't even,

869
01:32:14.24 --> 01:32:19.60
as upset as I was, and then I had to really realize that they were suffering in a much different way.

870
01:32:20.64 --> 01:32:26.16
Yeah, you also mentioned in the book that at one point you felt like that, and then you kind of had to

871
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:33.20
say, I'm a volunteer here, like I'm here because I want to be here, I can be sad, but they can't

872
01:32:33.20 --> 01:32:38.72
leave, this is it for them. Absolutely, and there's always a guilt that comes with that, and it's

873
01:32:38.72 --> 01:32:43.68
still something I grapple with. So I can go in and I can spend, however long I want to spend there

874
01:32:43.68 --> 01:32:50.88
months, weeks, whatever, and you get their stories, and you, you tell their stories, and then you get

875
01:32:50.88 --> 01:32:56.96
to go home, I get to get on a plane, I have an American passport, Australian passport, I go home, and

876
01:32:58.32 --> 01:33:04.48
they don't, they don't get to go home, they don't get to, they don't understand what, what that,

877
01:33:05.28 --> 01:33:11.76
that in itself being such a luxury, and there's a guilt that I, I feel with that sometimes,

878
01:33:11.76 --> 01:33:16.32
in just, in being that, and they don't view it that way, they view it as,

879
01:33:16.32 --> 01:33:21.92
why, you know, what a gift it is that someone would want to even come in and tell their story

880
01:33:21.92 --> 01:33:28.40
and would leave their comfortable home in their, you know, families and come and talk to us,

881
01:33:28.40 --> 01:33:34.64
and that's how they view it, which is lovely, but for me, it was always, yeah, a sense of

882
01:33:36.16 --> 01:33:40.80
of just filling a little bit of guilt about it, and I always tried not to be a vulture, I didn't

883
01:33:40.80 --> 01:33:46.56
want to go in and have somebody sort of open up and tell their story and then I, and then I take

884
01:33:46.56 --> 01:33:52.48
that story and I leave, and I don't know that it's ever, it's ever going to change anything for them,

885
01:33:52.48 --> 01:33:58.96
I don't know that it's ever going to do any good for them, so yeah, that's something I, I set with.

886
01:34:02.24 --> 01:34:05.76
What about the son ladies, tell us about the son ladies, because this is a cool story.

887
01:34:05.76 --> 01:34:11.36
It's a story extraordinary, so yeah, I heard about them and we went to sort of, we went for

888
01:34:11.36 --> 01:34:16.48
long drive to meet them and they were these extraordinary, easy women, most of them had come from

889
01:34:16.48 --> 01:34:25.04
Xinjar and, and so when, when I just came in in 2014, these, the easy, these had to flee up the mountain,

890
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:30.64
because there wasn't anywhere to go, it was all surrounded at the bottom, and the tragedy of it was,

891
01:34:30.64 --> 01:34:34.40
so many of them died on that mountain because they stopped to death, it was a middle of summer

892
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:40.48
and a rock in the summers, something else, but they stopped, and if they were describing, you know,

893
01:34:40.48 --> 01:34:45.68
having to throw children off the mountain, because that was going to be a better way for them to die than to,

894
01:34:45.68 --> 01:34:51.92
to die of stovation or dehydration, and that was really what's put in America to get back involved

895
01:34:51.92 --> 01:34:58.64
in Iraq was the Zidi plant, and the fact that of what happened to them was just in there was no,

896
01:34:58.64 --> 01:35:02.96
it was so hard to get aid and anything to them, so the women that survived that

897
01:35:02.96 --> 01:35:09.04
formed their own unit that they called the Sunlades, the first of the Sunlades, because they wanted to,

898
01:35:09.68 --> 01:35:14.96
I think, was multiple reasons, but they wanted to, to aid find their women that was still missing,

899
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:20.08
and be they wanted to be involved in that in that liberation of getting their towns and villages back,

900
01:35:20.08 --> 01:35:24.32
and they were just really really extraordinary women.

901
01:35:24.32 --> 01:35:29.92
They also wanted vengeance.

902
01:35:29.92 --> 01:35:33.20
Yeah, as you would, as you would.

903
01:35:34.72 --> 01:35:41.12
Yeah, no, it's a very cool section in there that you talk about, and they also had

904
01:35:43.12 --> 01:35:52.08
real, real situation, I mean, I'll just go to the books, we have a lot of our women in

905
01:35:52.08 --> 01:35:57.60
Mazuel being held as slaves. Their families are waiting for them, we are waiting for them,

906
01:35:57.60 --> 01:36:01.68
the liberation might help bring them home, so they're in the situation, they don't just want

907
01:36:01.68 --> 01:36:07.76
revenge, they have actual people that they know, their friends, their relatives that are actual slaves,

908
01:36:09.68 --> 01:36:16.48
and they can go help them, and that's what they're trying to do.

909
01:36:16.48 --> 01:36:22.40
You say this when you're talking to them, but what I also had come to learn about the

910
01:36:22.40 --> 01:36:27.84
Yazidis was that when ISIS had already taken away their hopes and happiness,

911
01:36:28.48 --> 01:36:32.40
they would now allow them to take away their sanity too. The Sunlades were strong,

912
01:36:32.40 --> 01:36:37.20
always sitting upright, a few tears were shed, but hastily wiped away as the morning melted

913
01:36:37.20 --> 01:36:43.52
into afternoon. ISIS had abducted Yazidi girls as young as eight, trading them at the market for

914
01:36:43.52 --> 01:36:49.04
a few dollars. I learned of one young mother who was pregnant at the time of capture,

915
01:36:49.04 --> 01:36:54.000
she'd given birth in the back room of her overlord's home, but was not permitted to fruit feed

916
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:02.40
her newborn son. The baby cried and cried. The Muslim militant beheaded him.

917
01:37:06.64 --> 01:37:12.40
The depth of the prairie video was hard to swallow, and we all sat and clouded quiet to it for a

918
01:37:12.40 --> 01:37:19.28
small period. It's important to us to be able to protect our dignity and honor a 19-year-old

919
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:25.44
son lady named Mesa finally said, softly shattering the wencing silence. My family is very proud.

920
01:37:25.44 --> 01:37:32.56
They encourage me to join. I'm very proud to protect my people. After all that has happened to us

921
01:37:32.56 --> 01:37:42.24
Yazidis, we are no longer afraid. And as brave and stoic as the son lady seems to

922
01:37:42.24 --> 01:37:48.40
me there was one thing that did frighten them. The notion that Yazidi boys who had been kidnapped

923
01:37:48.40 --> 01:37:54.96
from Mount Sinjar and presumably drugged and brainwashed by ISIS were now fighting their mothers

924
01:37:54.96 --> 01:38:12.16
and sisters under the block flag of ISIS. We now have terrorist Yazidis something that never used to be.

925
01:38:13.44 --> 01:38:20.80
So, we hear about child soldiers throughout history, but this idea of which happened where they

926
01:38:20.80 --> 01:38:27.76
would capture these Yazidi kids that are 7-8-9-10 years old and brainwashed them and abuse them

927
01:38:29.12 --> 01:38:43.04
and turn them into extremist ISIS terror kids. And that's still a really big problem for them.

928
01:38:43.04 --> 01:38:51.68
Even, I guess, given the lack of resources, so a lot of the boys that are coming back are still

929
01:38:51.68 --> 01:38:58.08
still very radicalized in many ways. And I remember being in a refugee camp or a displacement camp

930
01:38:58.08 --> 01:39:03.68
for Yazidi's once in hearing just a horrific story about how one of the, you must have been probably

931
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:08.88
66-67 years old and he'd been rescued and brought back and tried to be a head-ease baby sister.

932
01:39:08.88 --> 01:39:13.04
Yeah, Zed, this is name in the book.

933
01:39:29.12 --> 01:39:33.28
Back to the book, one blazing summer after a night travel, the bumpy road of couple hours

934
01:39:33.28 --> 01:39:41.20
north to the office of kidnapped affairs. It was perhaps one of the saddest structures I ever entered,

935
01:39:41.20 --> 01:39:45.92
not because the building itself painted a bright sunny yellow and standing indomitable in the

936
01:39:45.92 --> 01:39:51.60
middle of a city sprawling, but rather because of what it represented. The office had been established

937
01:39:51.60 --> 01:39:58.72
with support from the KRG Prime Minister after the ISIS eruption of 2014 to help find thousands

938
01:39:58.72 --> 01:40:03.36
that had gone missing. I would visit that office many times in the months to come into every time

939
01:40:03.36 --> 01:40:12.48
it would get Saturn. You're talking to one of the individuals there, Zaina. Zaina explained

940
01:40:12.48 --> 01:40:16.72
that it was her neighbor's Muslim families that had lived side-by-side with for generations who

941
01:40:16.72 --> 01:40:23.12
ended up turning on them. One morning she said our neighbors came for us. Zaina, who was 32 years old,

942
01:40:23.12 --> 01:40:28.96
had spent more than a year as an ISIS sex slave. When ISIS came, they said they didn't want to

943
01:40:28.96 --> 01:40:34.000
fight us. They told us to give them their weapons, our weapons. She said telling me her story

944
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:39.92
all over again, but this time faced a face where it felt cruder and more inescapable. We gave

945
01:40:39.92 --> 01:40:45.44
them everything we had. These were our Muslim neighbors, but so many of them had become ISIS and we didn't

946
01:40:45.44 --> 01:40:52.72
know. Zaina went, went as she recollected the day ISIS assaulted her village at the foot of

947
01:40:52.72 --> 01:40:57.60
Mount Sinjar. The elderly who could not run faster far enough were some of her executed.

948
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:05.04
Men and women separated with older men dragged off to mosques to be killed. The females,

949
01:41:05.04 --> 01:41:09.92
including girls as young as eight were loaded onto cars and trucks and bound for Mosul.

950
01:41:11.36 --> 01:41:18.88
ISIS took me, my sister, my brother's wife, and my little sister. For 13 days we were putting a

951
01:41:18.88 --> 01:41:24.72
school. We didn't know what would happen. There were about 50 people, women, and children squashed into a

952
01:41:24.72 --> 01:41:31.12
room. There was no water for us to wash ourselves. The children were sick. Zaina had lied to her

953
01:41:31.12 --> 01:41:36.08
captors telling them that she was married, hoping somehow it might spare her from their evil intentions,

954
01:41:36.08 --> 01:41:40.24
that somehow it would save her from getting robbed of the one thing she could never get back.

955
01:41:40.24 --> 01:41:46.24
Her captors, however, were undeterred. She and dozens of others were taken to a heavily guarded

956
01:41:46.24 --> 01:41:51.92
building in the ISIS controlled Iraq City of Tallahafar. Yazidi girls under the age of 14 were

957
01:41:51.92 --> 01:41:58.40
whisked away and sold at auctions. The remaining women were handed off the ISIS fighters and told

958
01:41:58.40 --> 01:42:05.12
they were henceforth their property. When a fighter grabbed Zaina and Carter were off to

959
01:42:05.68 --> 01:42:12.64
into a dust storm fear paralyzed her from head to toe. In its official propaganda materials,

960
01:42:12.64 --> 01:42:18.56
ISIS justified killing, raping, and enslaving Yazidis calling them devil worshippers,

961
01:42:18.56 --> 01:42:24.000
and linking them to their mandate to re-institute, re-institute slavery.

962
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:42.80
Raping them, those unbelievers, had become a core tenant of their theology.

963
01:42:42.80 --> 01:42:47.52
Zaina's angry impounders threw her into a prison cell. Days later she was transferred to another

964
01:42:47.52 --> 01:42:52.88
facility in Tallahafar and forced to convert to Islam onto the front of death. Zaina had already

965
01:42:52.88 --> 01:42:58.32
witnessed a dozen fellow Yazidis being executed and called blood as punishment for their escape attempts.

966
01:42:58.88 --> 01:43:03.68
She was not ready to die, but she was not ready to give up on finding her freedom. Zaina and her

967
01:43:03.68 --> 01:43:09.28
another Yazidi woman were sent to live with a gehaunist in the ISIS stronghold of Mazul.

968
01:43:10.08 --> 01:43:15.04
He took me to this place. They were flats, small tourist flats. It was a tourist community.

969
01:43:15.04 --> 01:43:27.76
He raped me. For the next five months Zaina remained inside Mazul and was handed off to another

970
01:43:27.76 --> 01:43:31.52
militant who locked her in a small room. This is how the game was played.

971
01:43:35.84 --> 01:43:39.92
Raping always been a weapon of war that thrived on silence, but the Yazidi community was

972
01:43:39.92 --> 01:43:45.52
bravely and gradually changing that notion. They were collectively bucking the mortification and the

973
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:50.64
fright and all the repercussions that came with it to speak out and tell the world that they

974
01:43:50.64 --> 01:44:11.04
would not be muted. It's a tough situation Zaina admitted with a shrug, but I am still here.

975
01:44:11.04 --> 01:44:20.80
I am skipping giant chunks of the book as I am going through with different details.

976
01:44:28.88 --> 01:44:36.80
Evil. I think I write a fair bit in the book about sexual violence because I think it's

977
01:44:36.80 --> 01:44:41.52
something that doesn't. It's very uncomfortable to talk about and it's something that even now

978
01:44:41.52 --> 01:44:48.48
we're seeing ISIS fighters and not, no ISIS fighters are being held accountable for that.

979
01:44:49.44 --> 01:44:55.84
And there's still this mentality of the terrorist, they're killing people. So what do we care

980
01:44:55.84 --> 01:45:04.40
about that for? We need to start shifting that perspective. They need to be trialed for those crimes

981
01:45:04.40 --> 01:45:10.56
as just as important as every other horrific crime that they've committed because that's something

982
01:45:10.56 --> 01:45:17.04
that needs to change. I think for so long, I mean, it officially became illegal in 98.

983
01:45:19.12 --> 01:45:26.88
Sexual violence in wartime. It's something that's still relatively new. There's a lot of work

984
01:45:26.88 --> 01:45:31.92
that needs to be done in that topic and within the international community that needs to be looked at

985
01:45:31.92 --> 01:45:35.60
and how can that be sort of brought to justice? Otherwise, you do have that impunity that's

986
01:45:35.60 --> 01:45:41.12
going to continue. And what so many of these women go through, have gone through and in so many

987
01:45:41.12 --> 01:45:47.20
different conflicts, I think it really deserves a lot more attention than what it gets. But it's

988
01:45:47.20 --> 01:45:50.32
uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable to talk about.

989
01:45:50.32 --> 01:46:05.44
Fast forward a little bit here to Fouloujia. The city is damaged, but nothing like the other cities

990
01:46:05.44 --> 01:46:10.16
where ISIS has been dislodged, explained in Iraqi. I tell intelligence officials, we work closely

991
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:15.92
on the Fouloujia campaign. This was a well-planned operation led by Iraq's Golden Division. The

992
01:46:15.92 --> 01:46:21.60
Golden Division was Iraq's special operations forces. It ultimately had been created

993
01:46:23.04 --> 01:46:29.04
by US-led coalition forces after the 2003 invasion and had received top-notch training.

994
01:46:34.56 --> 01:46:42.24
This is a local talking about the push through the city. And he said, if the decision was mine,

995
01:46:42.24 --> 01:46:47.36
I would have made a statue for every fighter in the battle against terrorism. Those heroes are

996
01:46:47.36 --> 01:46:55.12
examples of courage when faced with Daesh. It was awesome for me to watch, it was awesome for me to

997
01:46:55.12 --> 01:47:01.20
watch, as all this stuff was taking place. Obviously, I retired in 2010, but when we worked with the

998
01:47:01.20 --> 01:47:10.16
Iraqis, a lot of times, the Iraqi soldiers, they weren't very determined. And they would have a

999
01:47:10.16 --> 01:47:18.72
lot of hard times sticking to the fight. And we had an entire battalion one time leave the battlefield.

1000
01:47:19.68 --> 01:47:30.48
And so that was not a great look, right? And so when I started getting reports back from my friends,

1001
01:47:30.48 --> 01:47:35.20
that were in Missouri with the Iraqis and the Iraqis, we're fighting. They were fighting. And

1002
01:47:35.20 --> 01:47:41.92
not just in Missouri, but in Ramadi in Foulouza, the Iraqis were fighting. And it was, it was so,

1003
01:47:41.92 --> 01:47:46.72
that's kind of why I mentioned that. Because I had worked with some of the troops that trained

1004
01:47:46.72 --> 01:47:51.84
up the Iraqi special forces, the Iraqi special special operations forces, and they did take the lead.

1005
01:47:52.88 --> 01:47:59.28
And it was awesome to see their courage and that they were going in. They were fighting. They took

1006
01:47:59.28 --> 01:48:05.36
massive casualties in Missouri. They took massive casualties. My friend told me that in the first few

1007
01:48:05.36 --> 01:48:11.20
days, they thought to themselves, we're not, the Iraqis might run out of troops because they

1008
01:48:11.20 --> 01:48:15.92
are taking so many casualties. I can tell you, when we were in Ramadi in 2006, they wouldn't have

1009
01:48:15.92 --> 01:48:19.04
taken that many casualties because they wouldn't have continued to fight. They would have run away.

1010
01:48:19.04 --> 01:48:25.04
And so here, they were fighting for a cause that they believed in. And it was awesome to see that

1011
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:32.40
taking place. And I really noticed also just in between 2014, 2019, just that trajectory and how

1012
01:48:32.40 --> 01:48:40.40
much over that time, I guess that they were willing to win was really compounded. But yeah,

1013
01:48:40.40 --> 01:48:46.80
by the end of it, they've seen some of the most terrific combat that you can begin to imagine.

1014
01:48:46.80 --> 01:48:54.000
I mean, just the level of what they've experienced for those that have gotten through it is really

1015
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
remarkable.

1016
01:49:10.40 --> 01:49:14.72
You know, I can't, there's some of these examples that you give

1017
01:49:14.72 --> 01:49:25.12
of who this enemy was. I just, I just have to read them. Every day for three months, they

1018
01:49:25.12 --> 01:49:31.92
tortured me as you're recalled from where he sat, stranded on the Syrian side of the shutter

1019
01:49:31.92 --> 01:49:38.000
Turkish border. But after a while, the torture just became routine. He was one of the thousands

1020
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.88
of prisoners arrested by ISIS for so-called crimes like wearing Western jeans or smoking a

1021
01:49:42.88 --> 01:49:47.84
cigarette. But he was also one of a select few who had managed to claw their way out of the terrorist

1022
01:49:47.84 --> 01:49:54.72
groups, dungeons with all those limbs intact. Short of jail, liberated by opposing forces such

1023
01:49:54.72 --> 01:49:59.92
escape were considered rare.

1024
01:49:59.92 --> 01:50:15.20
And there's another one, Nazra, another former captive. ISIS told us we'll give you safety if you

1025
01:50:15.20 --> 01:50:21.44
give up your weapons. But they lied to us, they took our weapons and they arrested us.

1026
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:29.60
Many of Nazra's fellow soldiers had since been executed, but many remained incarcerated. There was

1027
01:50:29.60 --> 01:50:34.80
no rights or to attorneys do process trials or even a phone call. He estimated that as many as

1028
01:50:34.80 --> 01:50:39.76
2000 Iraqi armor soldiers had been slain since succumbing to ISIS over the past two years.

1029
01:50:39.76 --> 01:50:44.32
He also estimated that 5000 at that time remained in prison battles across the country.

1030
01:50:48.40 --> 01:50:52.56
The cages were so small, Nazra said that their tour sows were marked by the folds of

1031
01:50:52.56 --> 01:51:02.72
skin and their limbs tinge blue from the hours of crouching, curled like a fetus in the womb.

1032
01:51:05.04 --> 01:51:09.92
Women arrested by ISIS typically disappeared behind the prison's exterior held separately

1033
01:51:09.92 --> 01:51:16.48
from the men and were often never seen again. Children are not exempt from the torment either.

1034
01:51:16.48 --> 01:51:22.32
A large number of children have been arrested by ISIS. My friend, Hussom,

1035
01:51:22.32 --> 01:51:28.56
a member of the Syrian activist group, Raka is being slaughtered silently. He explained

1036
01:51:28.56 --> 01:51:34.24
the most common charges are insulting a law and cooperating with apostates. They are being

1037
01:51:34.24 --> 01:51:38.88
tortured just like men and some of them have died under torture. They torture children too,

1038
01:51:38.88 --> 01:51:42.96
mostly flogging, beating on the hands and feet and psychological torture.

1039
01:51:44.48 --> 01:51:49.84
I was administered with electric shocks. My bones were broken. I was hung by my feet from the ceiling

1040
01:51:49.84 --> 01:51:54.88
and beaten with my hands tied behind my back, said Ali. A professional in his mid-40s who had

1041
01:51:54.88 --> 01:51:59.28
been arrested in the early days of the terrorist onslaught on suspicion of being an atheist.

1042
01:52:01.28 --> 01:52:03.68
They swore on a Quran that I would be cut to pieces.

1043
01:52:03.68 --> 01:52:14.08
You make a note here, you can take a life without killing. That's what torture does.

1044
01:52:25.44 --> 01:52:31.20
Between the summers of 2015 and 2016, ISIS had been on a specially vicious rampage to

1045
01:52:31.20 --> 01:52:36.48
compensate for the loss of seasoned soldiers and had taken to drugging those that radicalized

1046
01:52:36.48 --> 01:52:43.68
or forced into its lair. ISIS is using special tablets. The fighters take drugs and they don't

1047
01:52:43.68 --> 01:52:48.48
know where they are or what they are doing. They are just shooting and fighting. One Kurdish intelligence

1048
01:52:48.48 --> 01:52:54.16
official explained. They lose their minds. Some can be shot 20 times before they go down.

1049
01:52:54.16 --> 01:52:58.000
That ominous drug was known as Captain Gone. Is that right?

1050
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.68
A meth anthedamine like variant of the band pharmaceutical, threatened, threatened of falling.

1051
01:53:07.04 --> 01:53:11.28
It was manufactured in copious quantities primarily in Lebanon and neighboring Syria,

1052
01:53:11.28 --> 01:53:20.40
where it was sold to ISIS through middlemen. They removed any barriers you would have the fighting.

1053
01:53:21.52 --> 01:53:24.24
There is no second guessing they just go out and kill.

1054
01:53:24.24 --> 01:53:31.36
It's still a very common battlefield drug. Often comes from Lebanon, on Osseria.

1055
01:53:33.44 --> 01:53:41.36
It's unfortunately, it goes beyond ISIS, but it's a very common drug that a lot of

1056
01:53:41.36 --> 01:53:47.76
militias and even government soldiers are being given to give them that sense of invincibility to

1057
01:53:47.76 --> 01:53:58.64
have them go out there and do whatever they're told. I think it really game prominence under ISIS.

1058
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:06.16
With little kids. Yeah. It's drugin' them out.

1059
01:54:09.92 --> 01:54:15.44
Among the ranks of captured brainwashed and drugs, drugged were scores of Yezidi boys

1060
01:54:15.44 --> 01:54:20.32
whose minds had been twisted to turn against their own people. They had been propelled into training

1061
01:54:20.32 --> 01:54:25.76
regimes that included Islamist indoctrination and weapons instruction. They had been forced into

1062
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:49.20
learning the finer points of beheading forced into becoming suicide bombers and into serving as human shields.

1063
01:54:56.72 --> 01:55:14.80
Did your perception of evil change while you were there?

1064
01:55:16.96 --> 01:55:22.72
I think in the beginning, perhaps had a little bit more of a black and white

1065
01:55:22.72 --> 01:55:31.84
perspective on it, especially in the US, we tend to sort of think

1066
01:55:33.76 --> 01:55:38.48
which I think is completely wrong, but it always comes down to a religion thing.

1067
01:55:38.48 --> 01:55:44.80
That always is often painted as the motivating factor. I think what I really learned

1068
01:55:44.80 --> 01:55:53.20
was for people that were joining ISIS, it was really one of five things or one of 10 things

1069
01:55:53.20 --> 01:55:58.32
that was motivating them to join. I think the complexities for me really grew in that

1070
01:55:58.32 --> 01:56:04.88
because I suddenly started to see ISIS's absolutely evil and that hasn't changed for me.

1071
01:56:04.88 --> 01:56:11.04
But what I started to see was the complexities of how they got to that point and why they joined

1072
01:56:11.04 --> 01:56:18.80
and it wasn't so black and white really and that majority of them were joining more out of

1073
01:56:18.80 --> 01:56:28.48
a necessity for survival than it necessarily was some kind of religious extremism.

1074
01:56:28.48 --> 01:56:34.08
However, there was a difference between the ones that were coming far and as were coming

1075
01:56:34.08 --> 01:56:39.68
and they were often a lot more extreme in that respect. What I found for the Iraqis in particular

1076
01:56:39.68 --> 01:56:46.08
that we're joining was that a lot of them is ISIS had come in and taken over their town or their

1077
01:56:46.08 --> 01:56:54.40
village and they still needed to feed their family. Those kind of complexities grew for me and

1078
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:59.20
it was a lot harder to look at things in such sort of black and white terms.

1079
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:03.20
Yeah, I think you're right that America definitely misses the point on that a lot.

1080
01:57:03.20 --> 01:57:12.000
It was always, I still have conversations with people that will talk to me about or they'll

1081
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.96
come at me about, you know, we had no reason to be fighting the Iraqis and I was like,

1082
01:57:16.96 --> 01:57:23.36
hey, we were fighting alongside the Iraqis. They were literally going into the same buildings with us.

1083
01:57:23.36 --> 01:57:28.80
That's what they were doing. We weren't fighting against the Iraqis. We were fighting against the

1084
01:57:28.80 --> 01:57:36.40
insurgents that were there. Same thing with the what you mentioned about, you know, how am I going

1085
01:57:36.40 --> 01:57:47.04
to feed my family? There's plenty of 14, 17, 19, 22-year-old young male Iraqis that wanted money

1086
01:57:47.76 --> 01:57:50.96
and how are they going to get money? Well, there's someone over here that's going to pay them

1087
01:57:50.96 --> 01:57:55.84
$50 to go shoot NRPG at the coalition forces and that's what they're going to do and they weren't

1088
01:57:55.84 --> 01:58:02.48
geodas. They were little hoodlums just like a little hoodlum in America. That's how you're going

1089
01:58:02.48 --> 01:58:10.16
to make them a living in America in some crappy city where you don't have any opportunities. Oh,

1090
01:58:10.16 --> 01:58:13.68
I'm going to be a drug dealer or I'm going to be a gangbanger because somebody's going to pay me,

1091
01:58:13.68 --> 01:58:19.44
you know, to go and carry this from here to there. It's an economic decision more than anything else.

1092
01:58:19.44 --> 01:58:25.20
And even when they're talking about, you know, if it's a religious thing, well, can't be a religious

1093
01:58:25.20 --> 01:58:31.28
thing because we've got it's the actual Muslims fighting against the Muslims. It's not like there's

1094
01:58:31.28 --> 01:58:37.44
there's it's not about that. And what the other crazy thing is, you know, when you talk to people

1095
01:58:37.44 --> 01:58:43.84
and, you know, I would explain, well, you know, we were working with often times of majority,

1096
01:58:43.84 --> 01:58:48.48
she, uh, army and it would be hard for them to interact with the Sunnis and people have no,

1097
01:58:48.48 --> 01:58:52.32
but they don't understand what we're talking about. And that was a big bit, but you know, with

1098
01:58:52.32 --> 01:58:58.24
ISIS, you know, you disband and, and entire, you know, the Sunnis were very dispensed and

1099
01:58:58.24 --> 01:59:02.56
after a sedan and yet they still had their weapons in there out on the street and feeling, you know,

1100
01:59:02.56 --> 01:59:07.76
persecuted by by the government and so what are they going to do? They're going to band together.

1101
01:59:07.76 --> 01:59:12.80
There was the same people. It wasn't anything you. I think ISIS just sort of looked at as

1102
01:59:12.80 --> 01:59:17.84
this group that came out of nowhere and dropped from the sky. Well, no, they, they were always there.

1103
01:59:17.84 --> 01:59:24.000
Yeah, um, they just kind of came together at some point. When you mentioned Baghdaddy,

1104
01:59:25.04 --> 01:59:35.12
Abu Bakr Baghdaddy, Al Baghdaddy, um, we, my task unit in Ramadi in 2006 went to go and

1105
01:59:35.12 --> 01:59:40.48
capture a kill him, got a mission to go capture kill him and didn't get him. It's actually the,

1106
01:59:40.48 --> 01:59:46.000
it's actually the opening story, life, life, bab and was the ground force commander on that

1107
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.40
operation. They got into a big gunfight because there was security there, which means he was probably

1108
01:59:50.40 --> 01:59:55.92
in that vicinity. But you, you're right. Well, it's not, these aren't, they didn't drop from the sky.

1109
01:59:55.92 --> 02:00:01.60
This was a guy that had been there and fought as an insurgent and was on the run and constantly

1110
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:08.96
trying to maneuver. And so yeah, these people didn't drop from the sky. And, you know, the other

1111
02:00:08.96 --> 02:00:15.84
crazy thing that you can compare to a lot of bad situations in the world where what they want

1112
02:00:15.84 --> 02:00:20.72
is there to be problems. So what the, what the insurgents want is to create division, right?

1113
02:00:20.72 --> 02:00:26.72
Division and they would go and bomb she-a-mosks just to get the she-as to lash out at the Sunis and

1114
02:00:26.72 --> 02:00:33.92
then the Sunis, they were, they were trying to create a civil war. And it was very, very hard to

1115
02:00:33.92 --> 02:00:39.44
walk that line and make sure that you're doing this in a proper way. And even when we, in Ramadi,

1116
02:00:40.64 --> 02:00:44.000
when we got there in 2006, I thought we were just going to do a big sweep through like we did,

1117
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.72
like like the Marines did in Flusha. Just go and rubble every building and just run through it.

1118
02:00:51.84 --> 02:00:58.48
And Maliki, the prime minister who is a she-a knew that if he did that, it would be bad.

1119
02:00:58.48 --> 02:01:01.52
It would be bad. And so he said, no, we're not going to do that. We're going to do it in a more

1120
02:01:02.40 --> 02:01:06.48
sparing way as with minimal force required. And that's what we did. There was still force required.

1121
02:01:06.48 --> 02:01:17.60
But it was a lot less kinetic than Flusha was. So yeah, I'll tell you, but all that being said,

1122
02:01:17.60 --> 02:01:24.88
I, the, the, the evil that's perpetrated is just absolutely horrific and you capture it in this

1123
02:01:24.88 --> 02:01:33.52
book. And what scares me the most about it is how easily people are swayed towards, it doesn't take

1124
02:01:33.52 --> 02:01:38.96
much to push somebody over the line from being a normal person to be heading children,

1125
02:01:40.72 --> 02:01:47.60
which is, which is horrific. And you know, I, I did one podcast on the, on the Me lie massacre.

1126
02:01:49.84 --> 02:01:56.48
And there was roughly 500 old men, women and children, no military age males there at all.

1127
02:01:56.48 --> 02:02:06.000
500 murdered raped mutilated. And the reading the interviews with the guys that perpetrated this

1128
02:02:06.56 --> 02:02:10.56
and you read their backgrounds and you read where they came from and you read what they did,

1129
02:02:12.16 --> 02:02:17.60
you can't, it's, we have to be on the lookout for this kind of stuff because these guys

1130
02:02:17.60 --> 02:02:25.76
committed heinous atrocities, equivalent of ISIS atrocities and the were Americans that had

1131
02:02:27.44 --> 02:02:33.44
crossover the line. Absolutely. And I really think, you know, this is something I found in Afghanistan

1132
02:02:33.44 --> 02:02:40.16
in Syria and Iraq and a lot of other places that we, when I say, we just don't give enough attention to

1133
02:02:40.16 --> 02:02:45.12
and that is government corruption and how much of these things are a symptom of that.

1134
02:02:45.12 --> 02:02:49.52
You know, if you have to pay someone every time you're going to go through a checkpoint,

1135
02:02:51.28 --> 02:02:57.36
so that some policeman can line his pocket. If you have to, if you see your leaders rolling around

1136
02:02:57.36 --> 02:03:03.36
within the, in these fancy cars and big houses and Rolexes and, and, and you're not, you know,

1137
02:03:03.36 --> 02:03:09.36
you can't get by a sweeping industry and still not getting any services. Then at some point it's

1138
02:03:09.36 --> 02:03:15.36
going to make you angry and when you're angry enough, I also think it's a big factor for, for joining

1139
02:03:15.36 --> 02:03:20.72
a lot of these groups to sort of rise up against their own governments and I think it's something

1140
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:24.96
that when I talked to officials about it, they'll often took quick to throw up their hands,

1141
02:03:24.96 --> 02:03:30.72
we can't do anything about that. That's just a systemic problem. Okay, but you're always going to be

1142
02:03:30.72 --> 02:03:37.28
dealing with terrorism as a systemic problem from that problem because corruption is just such a huge

1143
02:03:37.28 --> 02:03:41.92
driver of it. In every way, shape of form and I just think it's something that gets belly any

1144
02:03:41.92 --> 02:03:49.92
attention when it's such a big reason why these groups exist and continue to exist and we'll

1145
02:03:49.92 --> 02:03:54.80
continue to exist. Yeah, you have that, you have that little bit of anger in the back of your

1146
02:03:54.80 --> 02:03:59.68
mind that you're being oppressed and then someone comes along and says, hey, you can fight that

1147
02:03:59.68 --> 02:04:10.56
oppression with us and I'm in. Let's do this. Yeah. Fast forward a little bit. What does war look like?

1148
02:04:13.20 --> 02:04:18.72
It isn't just blister buildings and empty brass casings and displacement camps. War looks like wounds

1149
02:04:19.52 --> 02:04:24.56
and soldiers who don't resemble fierce fighters but are men in unfathomable pain.

1150
02:04:24.56 --> 02:04:31.44
Soldiers belong to someone. They are mothers child. Someone created them and brought them into

1151
02:04:31.44 --> 02:04:39.28
the world only for the world to rip them apart and for what was it worth it? It was always the

1152
02:04:39.28 --> 02:04:49.44
question in my mind but ever the hardest to ask. Soldiers in medical staff, you're going to

1153
02:04:49.44 --> 02:04:55.20
into a hospital. Soldiers in medical staff face a fight of a different kind. No money and no

1154
02:04:55.20 --> 02:05:01.52
medicine to treat almost 9,500 that have been seriously wounded. The tiny hospital, if one could even

1155
02:05:01.52 --> 02:05:07.52
call it that had no MRI equipment or CT scanners, it reminded me of poor clinics of a Soviet time in place.

1156
02:05:10.08 --> 02:05:14.96
There were thousands of open, unresolved case files, several soldiers, young faces, old faces

1157
02:05:14.96 --> 02:05:20.56
and with body parts gone gone, came forward to outline their predicaments and pain to reconstruct

1158
02:05:20.56 --> 02:05:24.40
the blows to their bodies. I feverously jotted down all I could in my friend notebook.

1159
02:05:29.44 --> 02:05:36.64
And you go through just talking to soldiers and their horrific wounds that they're

1160
02:05:36.64 --> 02:05:44.64
you know, Powwana ishmail. Been defusing a roadside bomb for Teshmerga on Christmas Eve in 2014

1161
02:05:44.64 --> 02:05:49.36
when it exploded. His two comrades died, much of his body was burned and his thigh skin had been reduced to

1162
02:05:49.36 --> 02:05:59.60
ash. Carwans side 37 years old, proudly dressed in his soldiers uniform. He's one of the victims of the

1163
02:05:59.60 --> 02:06:08.80
ISIS chemical attack. Kiter Merckor 42 years old, 25-year-old Peshmerga servicemen,

1164
02:06:08.80 --> 02:06:16.32
ambushed by an ISIS vehicle, around from a PKM machine gun cleaved below his left ear

1165
02:06:16.32 --> 02:06:21.84
and lodged a few millimeters from the top disk in his back. The round remained there infected

1166
02:06:21.84 --> 02:06:30.48
and inflamed. His hands were numb. His head ached persistently. Bazaar who sane, 32-year-old,

1167
02:06:31.60 --> 02:06:40.32
been working on the front lines, struck by a sniper's bullet in broad daylight,

1168
02:06:40.32 --> 02:06:45.04
reduced from a strong able-bodied man to an almost infantile, physical and mental state

1169
02:06:45.04 --> 02:06:49.36
who sang could no longer control his legs. Nor could he control his head. And I movement

1170
02:06:49.36 --> 02:06:56.96
occasionally he could speak slowly other times. His eyes just swelled with confused tears as the words

1171
02:06:56.96 --> 02:07:01.44
would not come out.

1172
02:07:01.44 --> 02:07:19.84
These men had been robbed of bones and body parts that could not grow back, some had lost their

1173
02:07:19.84 --> 02:07:25.12
minds, but none had lost their self-respect. They were heroes who did not look like conventional

1174
02:07:25.12 --> 02:07:38.32
heroes, but constituted what the Hollywood depiction of heroes should have been.

1175
02:07:38.32 --> 02:07:46.88
And once again to your earlier point, Hollywood, when you read 40 were wounded or 12 were wounded

1176
02:07:46.88 --> 02:07:53.20
or 7 were wounded or a thousand were wounded, the way you did and I just breezed through those.

1177
02:07:53.20 --> 02:07:58.80
I didn't go into the detail that you go into some of the backstory, but every one of those little

1178
02:07:58.80 --> 02:08:04.80
statistics is a person.

1179
02:08:11.76 --> 02:08:20.000
Going back to Tallah Far. This is a, uh, here's a tactic. When the people came, when the people

1180
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.44
from town heard that Kirkuk had been taken over by ISIS, many came out to the streets to celebrate.

1181
02:08:25.44 --> 02:08:31.68
So this is what we're talking about. You got people that you got the Shia power and you've got

1182
02:08:31.68 --> 02:08:36.32
ISIS taking over Kirkuk and now the Sunnis come out and see, yeah, let's celebrate and then what

1183
02:08:36.32 --> 02:08:40.56
happens. With all the families out in the street, ISIS members then executed their scheme and had

1184
02:08:40.56 --> 02:08:44.24
the trucks ready and filled them with young boys and imported them to the front lines.

1185
02:08:44.24 --> 02:08:50.80
ISIS has used all sorts of tactics and human shields many times before.

1186
02:08:53.92 --> 02:08:59.20
ISIS was using the young boys for three main functions, functions on their fate full front line

1187
02:08:59.20 --> 02:09:02.72
as direct fighters as human shields and as suicide bombers.

1188
02:09:06.40 --> 02:09:11.44
One soldier showed me a video of the remnants of a cotterized truck and told me the three

1189
02:09:11.44 --> 02:09:14.80
inside were just kids taken from the Tallah Far streets just a day earlier.

1190
02:09:24.08 --> 02:09:28.96
What is war? War is the reason you wake up. There is no life outside of the conflict.

1191
02:09:28.96 --> 02:09:34.56
You eat and breathe. When you're in it, it is impossible to have a life outside or even to if you

1192
02:09:34.56 --> 02:09:41.36
attempt the rich willistic movements of daily life. The soldiers I met may have had their family

1193
02:09:41.36 --> 02:09:46.48
but war always came first. It was not a choice. They had no option but to live it and breathe it.

1194
02:09:48.48 --> 02:09:53.04
They had all abandoned their studies or deserted their livestock or quit their jobs to defend

1195
02:09:53.04 --> 02:09:58.000
their people for a poultry paycheck, a paycheck that often did not come on time if at all.

1196
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:17.52
There was no time for anything but war. How often are you going in and out of country during this time?

1197
02:10:19.36 --> 02:10:24.000
L.S. counter the amount of trips. Would you normally stay for a month?

1198
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:36.40
Yes. Some points in a trip for a few weeks. I often left it very open and depending on

1199
02:10:36.40 --> 02:10:45.20
getting what I needed. I would go to other countries in between it all. I was going to

1200
02:10:45.20 --> 02:10:51.20
cover other conflicts at the same time and then I would go back. I'd spend a chunk of time

1201
02:10:51.20 --> 02:10:57.04
back in the US and then go back and spend a chunk of time. I would just whatever I could get that.

1202
02:10:57.04 --> 02:11:07.76
I felt I needed to go back for and then it was a very obituary to how long I thought I needed to be

1203
02:11:07.76 --> 02:11:16.16
there. Is there any of your work driving this? Is there stories that you owe or anything like that?

1204
02:11:16.16 --> 02:11:21.12
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. No. Nothing sort of pragmatic in that sense. It was more

1205
02:11:21.12 --> 02:11:29.60
or yeah. It was more just trying to develop it as it needed to be, I guess, in that very organic sense.

1206
02:11:31.20 --> 02:11:36.80
We've talked about the sun ladies. We've talked about some. I think we've talked about some of the

1207
02:11:36.80 --> 02:11:43.12
other Peshmerga females. There are females on the other side as well.

1208
02:11:43.12 --> 02:11:55.12
Females of the Caliphate. I got 15 years one plump 54-year-old woman said flopping onto the office

1209
02:11:55.12 --> 02:12:04.000
couch for being an ISIS terrorist. I wanted to be a suicide bomber. You refer to this female as

1210
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:10.000
KS. KS wanted to tell her story in a jagged timeline, a biography bound by battles. She was the

1211
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.24
daughter of an Arab father and a Kurdish mother. She grew up speaking her grandfather's language of

1212
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:23.68
Turkmen. She ended up in ISIS after her marriage fell apart. I wanted to divorce. I was very poor.

1213
02:12:23.68 --> 02:12:29.52
I have schizophrenia and was just diagnosed with blood cancer and my only daughter wasn't treating me

1214
02:12:29.52 --> 02:12:35.44
well. I was borrowing money from people for the treatment KS lamented. I was welling. But then I

1215
02:12:35.44 --> 02:12:42.88
grew desperate. In the obscure days after Mosul, I was snatched. Oh, after Mosul was snatched by ISIS

1216
02:12:42.88 --> 02:12:47.92
in June of 2014. When the terrorist group was quickly capturing territory across Iraq,

1217
02:12:47.92 --> 02:12:53.76
she had detailed her situation to a cab driver named Machmood in her home city of Kerkuk.

1218
02:12:54.32 --> 02:12:59.84
He offered her a solution. He was ISIS instead of I joined they would treat me well and pay me.

1219
02:12:59.84 --> 02:13:07.44
I said I would join on one condition that they make me a suicide bomber and get me out of my misery.

1220
02:13:07.44 --> 02:13:15.84
The only thing I was seeking was to be bombed and die. So again, you were pointing out

1221
02:13:17.68 --> 02:13:22.64
who becomes ISIS and why? And there you go. Here you have someone that skits a frenic has all these

1222
02:13:22.64 --> 02:13:28.16
problems in their life and you see the same thing in cults in America. You take someone that's

1223
02:13:28.16 --> 02:13:33.44
been abused. You take someone that's down on their luck. And that's who cults actually go after.

1224
02:13:33.44 --> 02:13:37.84
They go after people like that for the most part. And this is a classic situation.

1225
02:13:38.64 --> 02:13:47.20
Psychological issues, divorce, being treated bad by her daughter, there you go.

1226
02:13:48.16 --> 02:13:51.76
Yeah, and she, you know, in the when I was sitting with her and she's sort of

1227
02:13:51.76 --> 02:13:57.92
vacillating between this laughing and crying and it was all, it was all very bizarre but I talked

1228
02:13:57.92 --> 02:14:02.24
in length with one of the guards that was in the river at the time when she was telling me

1229
02:14:02.24 --> 02:14:07.76
her story and you know, she sort of panning herself to be this very innocent person but

1230
02:14:07.76 --> 02:14:13.28
as two sides to the story and the other side being that she was really evil and she was one of

1231
02:14:13.28 --> 02:14:19.12
the people that was taking these easy women and helping facilitate them to be sold and

1232
02:14:19.12 --> 02:14:24.16
debating them and things. So, you know, it's just a very complicated situation in that.

1233
02:14:32.80 --> 02:14:38.80
Colonel Marwan, sobriety of the Yazidi, Peshmergobitain recalled that in March 2017,

1234
02:14:38.80 --> 02:14:43.92
a disillusioned American, moving from females. This is to Westerners amongst the ranks.

1235
02:14:43.92 --> 02:14:51.36
A disillusioned American surrendered himself to the Peshmergobitain. He had begged them not to

1236
02:14:51.36 --> 02:14:58.64
shoot him. That fighter turned out to be 26-year-old Mohammed Jamal Kuis from Virginia,

1237
02:14:59.04 --> 02:15:02.72
who was later deported to Virginia's eastern district for indictment.

1238
02:15:02.72 --> 02:15:14.72
A 20-year-old jail sentence handed down October 2017 awaited him. And you go through some of these

1239
02:15:14.72 --> 02:15:23.52
other Westerners, males, females coming in from first world countries, coming in from America,

1240
02:15:23.52 --> 02:15:28.96
coming in from parts of Europe to go, giving up as crazy. Crazy.

1241
02:15:28.96 --> 02:15:35.44
They were their recruitment campaign for foreign as was pretty extensive.

1242
02:15:39.76 --> 02:15:44.88
Moving forward into the book, all tools in the war against ISIS had eventually pointed to

1243
02:15:44.88 --> 02:15:52.96
Mosul. It was the ISIS-Bredden butter, the head of the snake. I learned that many Mosul civilians,

1244
02:15:52.96 --> 02:15:58.08
innocent souls who had managed to survive over three years of ISIS occupation were slaughtered

1245
02:15:58.08 --> 02:16:05.92
in retaliation as Iraqi forces around the city. To have made it this far, just to be taken out

1246
02:16:05.92 --> 02:16:12.000
in the twilight of the fight jarred me. Their body parts were strewn across dusty streets.

1247
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.44
Tiny bodies cracked open, left to die after their fleeing parents were gunned down,

1248
02:16:17.44 --> 02:16:23.12
some hiding underneath the bloody corpses of their family members, orphaned and forever traumatized.

1249
02:16:23.12 --> 02:16:31.68
I remembered the house of a broken woman. Her little daughter had been lost for days,

1250
02:16:31.68 --> 02:16:36.64
until she was found with nothing but a gaping black hole where the back of her head used to be.

1251
02:16:40.08 --> 02:16:44.96
Suicide belts are strapped on to helpless civilians, including women and children by ISIS,

1252
02:16:44.96 --> 02:16:54.16
a crime of the Iraqi counterterrorism forces conjectured. This was a big dilemma. We didn't know

1253
02:16:54.16 --> 02:16:59.60
who a bomber was and who was not many of our men died from these people forced to be bombers.

1254
02:17:03.76 --> 02:17:09.12
This is one of the things that when my friends were over there and they were reporting back,

1255
02:17:09.12 --> 02:17:18.08
they'd have these kids, women, children, men coming to checkpoints with strapped with bombs.

1256
02:17:19.28 --> 02:17:27.92
The predicament that they were in, but then also the great lengths that the Americans made

1257
02:17:27.92 --> 02:17:33.92
to try and spare the lot. You normally do with a suit. Obviously a suicide bomber. What do you

1258
02:17:33.92 --> 02:17:40.56
do? You can kill them. What do you do with a roadside bomber and IED? You blow it. What we do?

1259
02:17:40.56 --> 02:17:44.96
We call it blowing in place. You just go put a explosive charge near it and you blow it up and then it's

1260
02:17:44.96 --> 02:17:49.12
safe. What you don't want to have to do, you do have to do it sometimes, but you don't have to go

1261
02:17:49.12 --> 02:17:56.000
there with whatever, like an action movie with a pair of pliers and a wire cutters and actually

1262
02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.76
disarm that thing because it's dangerous. By the way, the way they build those bombs often times

1263
02:18:01.76 --> 02:18:07.12
when you cut one wire, it's rigged to blow up and that somehow causes detonation anyways.

1264
02:18:07.12 --> 02:18:13.20
So what they had in many of these cases were these kids or innocent people that had these bombs

1265
02:18:13.20 --> 02:18:21.84
strapped and go walk into the checkpoint. It's not like complicate and it's

1266
02:18:23.44 --> 02:18:29.76
that there's no easy solution to that. Yeah, you know we talked about on a few podcasts ago,

1267
02:18:29.76 --> 02:18:36.16
we talked about the idea of total war, which is at the far extreme of conflict, right? Total war.

1268
02:18:36.16 --> 02:18:40.32
We will do absolutely any. And you asked me echo Charles, you asked me,

1269
02:18:40.32 --> 02:18:46.72
give me like as any examples of total war and I said, ISIS. There was no boundaries,

1270
02:18:46.72 --> 02:18:53.28
zero boundaries to what they would do. I mean America, pretty much always operates in some

1271
02:18:53.28 --> 02:18:59.20
there's some cap. Now you could say World War II, once we dropped the atomic bombs, it was like,

1272
02:18:59.20 --> 02:19:04.32
hey, this is total war and we are going to do whatever it takes to win as quickly as possible.

1273
02:19:04.32 --> 02:19:08.72
That's how you can make a decision to say, hey, we're going to drop these atomic weapons.

1274
02:19:11.04 --> 02:19:16.16
But other than that, you know, there's always rules of engagement, there's always Geneva

1275
02:19:16.16 --> 02:19:19.92
convention, there's always all these constraints, but if you want to talk about just total war,

1276
02:19:19.92 --> 02:19:26.40
we will do absolutely anything to and stoop to any level of barbarity to try and achieve victory.

1277
02:19:26.40 --> 02:19:27.44
This is an example.

1278
02:19:34.40 --> 02:19:40.32
Female ISIS members were said to have stoop to weaponizing their own babies, seemingly harmless

1279
02:19:40.32 --> 02:19:45.28
mothers carrying their babies had been trained to enter areas thick with Iraqi soldiers only to blow

1280
02:19:45.28 --> 02:19:50.40
themselves up their young and their liberators around them to bits.

1281
02:19:53.28 --> 02:19:57.84
An enemy is most dangerous when on the defensive or when they are fighting for survival.

1282
02:19:57.84 --> 02:20:03.04
This was not an easy fight and ISIS was not the JV team. ISIS did not care for rules of

1283
02:20:03.04 --> 02:20:08.08
engagement by which the West was taught to fight. ISIS did whatever it would take to achieve

1284
02:20:08.08 --> 02:20:18.48
its strategic objectives regardless of the consequences. There you go, you and me on the same page.

1285
02:20:18.48 --> 02:20:25.04
President Trump gave a free hand to his then defense secretary Mattis who in May stressed military

1286
02:20:25.04 --> 02:20:30.72
commanders were no longer slowed by Washington decision cycles or by the White House Micro Managing

1287
02:20:30.72 --> 02:20:36.32
that existed with President Obama. As a result of the new approach, the fall of ISIS and Iraq

1288
02:20:36.32 --> 02:20:42.08
at least in terms of territory came even more swiftly than hardened US military leaders expected.

1289
02:20:42.08 --> 02:20:48.40
It moved more quickly than at least I had anticipated Brigadier General Croph said,

1290
02:20:48.40 --> 02:20:52.40
we in the Iraqi security forces were able to hunt down and target ISIS leadership,

1291
02:20:52.40 --> 02:20:53.60
target their command and control.

1292
02:20:56.32 --> 02:21:01.20
So I kind of heard that a lot from the leadership when I was interviewing them,

1293
02:21:01.20 --> 02:21:07.12
I think that was in the end of 2017 and that was sort of the recurring theme was that they

1294
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:12.64
were given a more of a free hand and they were sort of able to push forward. I could look at that

1295
02:21:12.64 --> 02:21:21.60
in hindsight in many different ways and how that could be interpreted. But that was the narrative

1296
02:21:21.60 --> 02:21:26.56
on the ground that the end of 2017 was that they felt that they were given more support than they

1297
02:21:26.56 --> 02:21:32.32
had been in the past. Yeah, I think that and it's also very interesting when you look at the fact

1298
02:21:32.32 --> 02:21:39.04
that this is General Mattis, right? This is General Mattis who's saying this and obviously

1299
02:21:39.04 --> 02:21:46.80
General Mattis and President Trump in the end were not friendly, which it shows you how

1300
02:21:47.52 --> 02:21:53.44
very caustic Trump's leadership could be or could become if you, you know,

1301
02:21:53.44 --> 02:21:59.28
caustic. And it didn't start out that way clearly. You know, at some point they were seeing

1302
02:21:59.28 --> 02:22:06.32
out of why. It's what I love about this and what I what I, is this is decentralized command.

1303
02:22:06.32 --> 02:22:11.68
This is saying, okay, listen, I'm the president. There's bad guys there. I don't care what you do.

1304
02:22:11.68 --> 02:22:16.24
What I want them, I want them gone. I want that that problem solved. Commanders on the ground.

1305
02:22:16.24 --> 02:22:21.04
Okay, we're going to go solve it. Yeah, that's what I said to go solve it. That's, that's a great

1306
02:22:21.04 --> 02:22:28.40
sign, right? That's a great sign. And obviously, I guess the disease of victory is General Patent

1307
02:22:28.40 --> 02:22:34.000
used to call it meaning, hey, we won this thing now. Everyone should just listen to me more. I mean,

1308
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.88
that's that's what you have to watch out for. You can't let your ego make you think that just

1309
02:22:38.88 --> 02:22:43.12
because you made one good decision, you're going to make all good decisions. It doesn't work that

1310
02:22:43.12 --> 02:22:53.36
way, but this is just again, very revealing of how confusing Donald Trump's leadership could be

1311
02:22:53.92 --> 02:23:00.40
that you could have that he could have completely empowered General Mattis to go and solve this problem.

1312
02:23:01.60 --> 02:23:09.20
And then, a couple years later, General Mattis leaves. Yeah, and I think it really started that way

1313
02:23:09.20 --> 02:23:14.64
with a rock with Afghanistan. Go do what the job needs to be done. And my understanding from

1314
02:23:14.64 --> 02:23:20.08
talking to different people at the White House the time was that President Trump, you, he's not,

1315
02:23:20.08 --> 02:23:25.04
you know, he is the commander of chief, but was the commander of chief, but isn't a military guy. So he

1316
02:23:25.04 --> 02:23:33.28
kind of, he gave that job to the generals to do. And then at some point, I feel like that shifted.

1317
02:23:33.28 --> 02:23:40.32
And the love that he sort of had for the men, then somehow sort of changed. I'm not entirely

1318
02:23:40.32 --> 02:23:46.16
perry to what happened there, but there was definitely a shift at some point. Yeah, it was all very

1319
02:23:46.16 --> 02:23:53.36
strange to watch from the outside. General McMaster is another guy that was on his staff who is

1320
02:23:54.40 --> 02:23:57.92
from everything I understand I've never met with him. I've never we've covered some of his stuff

1321
02:23:57.92 --> 02:24:05.52
on this podcast because he's very risk from everything I've understood. He's one of the most

1322
02:24:05.52 --> 02:24:12.96
respected guys. He worked up in Tallah Far. My brigade commander when I was in Ramadi had relieved

1323
02:24:12.96 --> 02:24:18.40
him in Tallah Far. He had done an amazing job in Tallah Far. Bringing stability to that city. We

1324
02:24:18.40 --> 02:24:29.04
use that plan in Ramadi. So McMaster is just a very well respected and he was gone. General Kelly,

1325
02:24:29.04 --> 02:24:40.56
same thing. I mean, just a Marines Marine, whose son was killed in Afghanistan. And he ends up.

1326
02:24:40.56 --> 02:24:44.80
So you're sitting there. It's causing a lot. It's very, it makes it, it's obvious that it's very

1327
02:24:44.80 --> 02:24:54.48
hard to logically track the fought patterns of President Trump. You can't really just, there's

1328
02:24:54.48 --> 02:25:01.04
some inconsistency there that you just, it's just confusing. But at this time, it was very clear.

1329
02:25:01.04 --> 02:25:07.20
This is another great, on another thing that is very positive. It says here, we really had one mandate

1330
02:25:07.20 --> 02:25:14.64
and that was tenable for Iraqi security forces to defeat ISIS militarily here in Alambar.

1331
02:25:15.36 --> 02:25:21.12
I feel we have achieved that mission. Folsom said, I never felt constrained in a lot of ways.

1332
02:25:21.12 --> 02:25:25.92
I felt liberated because we had a clear mandate and there was no questioning that.

1333
02:25:27.76 --> 02:25:32.72
We were able to focus on what our job was without distraction. And I think that goes a long way

1334
02:25:32.72 --> 02:25:38.08
in what we were trying to accomplish. So that's another thing. It was a very clear mission.

1335
02:25:38.80 --> 02:25:46.72
And I'm sure General Mattis drove a lot of that to say, okay, what do you want us to do?

1336
02:25:47.12 --> 02:25:53.60
Because if you don't have a clear mission, well, I mean, I do, I mean, say anything.

1337
02:25:53.60 --> 02:25:58.08
If you don't have a clear mission, what are you trying to do? Yeah. And that mission was

1338
02:25:58.08 --> 02:26:04.48
defeat ISIS and it became very complicated, I think, because everybody wanted to argue,

1339
02:26:04.48 --> 02:26:10.16
well, what does defeat ISIS mean or people thought, well, if we leave Syria, then that leaves

1340
02:26:10.16 --> 02:26:17.28
it open to all sorts of other things. But in Trump's mind, I think it was clear. It was defeat

1341
02:26:17.28 --> 02:26:22.80
ISIS militarily at least. Not defeat the ideology. I'm not necessarily, I think that's going

1342
02:26:22.80 --> 02:26:31.76
into a whole different rabbit hole, but in terms of territory, arguably yes, that was something

1343
02:26:31.76 --> 02:26:40.56
that was achieved. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And killed a lot of them. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters

1344
02:26:40.56 --> 02:26:53.92
were killed. I'm going to fast forward a little bit. You talk from everything, like I said,

1345
02:26:53.92 --> 02:26:58.88
you're effort to capture many different perspectives and one of the one of the perspectives

1346
02:26:58.88 --> 02:27:04.96
that you capture in here is of the Iraqi Christians. And I had to read this part, because just

1347
02:27:04.96 --> 02:27:11.68
because it's very moving. Scores of Iraqi Christians in the region who earlier fled in fear,

1348
02:27:11.68 --> 02:27:16.32
neighboring countries such as Jordan Lebanon, Turkey weren't much better off. Father Afram said,

1349
02:27:17.92 --> 02:27:24.56
I'm going to send that name right Afram. They had waited years for visas to Western nations,

1350
02:27:24.56 --> 02:27:29.60
only to be rejected. Now the refugees were stranded. They did not have money or the Kurds to

1351
02:27:29.60 --> 02:27:34.96
resettle in other pockets of Iraq. Those fortunate enough to have been granted visas had to watch

1352
02:27:34.96 --> 02:27:40.000
their families be split apart. Some members lived in the US, others in Europe, and still others

1353
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:45.52
were strewn across the Middle East. What is war? It was options, almost all bad.

1354
02:27:47.12 --> 02:27:52.64
This war ever bring about options that could be considered good. That sense of helplessness

1355
02:27:52.64 --> 02:27:59.36
hung in the air. During Sunday's service, women in aphodic,

1356
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:06.80
mantillas, saying and prayed, and the men stuck struck candles to elume the dark in space,

1357
02:28:06.80 --> 02:28:13.76
while tiny children played outside in the cold sunshine. Icists destroyed all the crosses,

1358
02:28:13.76 --> 02:28:18.48
crosses that have been made 150 years ago. Father Afram said,

1359
02:28:18.48 --> 02:28:33.68
but I said to my people, make new crosses. You note in here, again, you have a couple modes,

1360
02:28:33.68 --> 02:28:41.44
and I'd say 10% of the book is sort of history, slash facts. It's a gift's context around one of

1361
02:28:41.44 --> 02:28:50.72
the history lessons that you give us is that in 2003, as the Americans invaded for the first time,

1362
02:28:51.92 --> 02:28:57.76
into Iraq, there's 1.5 million Christians. In 2019, there's 200,000 Christians in Iraq.

1363
02:29:03.36 --> 02:29:06.96
Yeah, and there's two sort of very different schools of thought. I think in that is that

1364
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:14.24
one being a lot more effort should be made to ensuring that they do stay. That's the land,

1365
02:29:15.44 --> 02:29:22.32
that's their homeland, Iraq essentially. So that all the second thought being, they're going

1366
02:29:22.32 --> 02:29:27.36
to continue to be persecuted, regardless of whether it's ISIS, whether it's government, whether

1367
02:29:27.36 --> 02:29:34.40
it's an al-Qaeda, irrespective of that their lives are in danger. So everything needs to be done

1368
02:29:34.40 --> 02:29:38.88
to sort of bring them out and have them resettled in Europe or the United States. So this two

1369
02:29:40.88 --> 02:29:45.36
kinds of skism, I think, in that community because there's just two very divergent thoughts on what

1370
02:29:45.36 --> 02:29:50.32
the better alternative to that is. Help them stay or help them live.

1371
02:29:50.32 --> 02:30:04.40
Oh, hold section here, ISIS wives, infighting jealousy and regrets. And this is where, you know,

1372
02:30:04.40 --> 02:30:10.16
you started, I didn't dive too much into it. You said, you were talking about the recruitment

1373
02:30:10.16 --> 02:30:15.28
system that they had in Europe and I kind of moved past it. I didn't mean to ignore that, but it's

1374
02:30:15.28 --> 02:30:22.000
just that you addressed a little bit more here. Lena Frisler was a 28-year-old blue-eyed

1375
02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:27.28
blonde with milky pale skin from Hamburg, Germany. She was once an aspiring business student

1376
02:30:27.28 --> 02:30:33.44
with European dream of money, travel, family, and success. In 2012, she married converted to Islam

1377
02:30:33.44 --> 02:30:38.72
and left the comforts of her home for Turkey. She said that she had made the abrupt decision

1378
02:30:38.72 --> 02:30:44.80
after being cordured and encouraged by a known radical solifist in the Hamburg area. She called

1379
02:30:44.80 --> 02:30:51.92
him Pierre Vogel, who urged others to rise up and fight against the Bashar al-Assad Syrian regime.

1380
02:30:52.80 --> 02:30:58.16
Her husband also came under Pierre's spell. One day, my husband came home and told me he wants to

1381
02:30:58.16 --> 02:31:05.28
go to Syria and fight. Lena told me matter, faculty as she nursed her one year's old son,

1382
02:31:05.28 --> 02:31:13.44
her second child with an ISIS fighter. And that goes back to what I said earlier with the government,

1383
02:31:13.44 --> 02:31:18.48
the corruption, how much of this is the symptom of that big problem that we tend to ignore.

1384
02:31:18.48 --> 02:31:23.76
And that's what I found a lot with these women and these fighters that was especially the foreigners.

1385
02:31:23.76 --> 02:31:28.96
Yes, some were going very specifically to join ISIS, but there was a sort of whole group that

1386
02:31:28.96 --> 02:31:34.72
went before ISIS was even a thing. And their mandate was to go and fight Bashar.

1387
02:31:34.72 --> 02:31:45.12
And so I think that sort of we tend to overlook how much of a symptom, you know, it is of a government

1388
02:31:45.12 --> 02:31:56.96
problem. Another germinated of a stunning raven-haired 26-year-old named Heidi Raufi told me she

1389
02:31:56.96 --> 02:32:02.40
spent most of her day as alone in the 10. She said she had fallen in love with an older boy in 2009,

1390
02:32:02.40 --> 02:32:07.36
then several years in a relationship he informed her that he was going to help the people of Syria

1391
02:32:07.36 --> 02:32:12.96
that were suffering as a result of the war and Bashar al-Assad. Love struck Heidi ditched her

1392
02:32:12.96 --> 02:32:18.80
social network, her social work studies for a life of a Jihadi wife in 2014.

1393
02:32:20.08 --> 02:32:23.68
Her beloved Korean later died on the battlefield. She remarried.

1394
02:32:25.20 --> 02:32:28.80
Here's the remarrying. It was an easy process. There was just, there was an ISIS man.

1395
02:32:28.80 --> 02:32:33.20
We all knew with a laptop and he would just ask us what we wanted and bring us guys to choose.

1396
02:32:34.16 --> 02:32:38.64
I met three but chose a man from Kosovo blinded by Shrapnel because he wanted to go to Turkey

1397
02:32:38.64 --> 02:32:44.48
for an operation. That was my out. So she was trying to get out now. She never made it across the

1398
02:32:44.48 --> 02:32:49.52
border. Months dragged on. She wanted to return home to Germany. I wasn't love. It was on the stake.

1399
02:32:52.72 --> 02:32:56.48
And often in these women when they tried to get out, they'd get money. Someone from home would

1400
02:32:56.48 --> 02:33:00.80
send them money and they'd pay what they called a smuggler or whatever to get them out.

1401
02:33:00.80 --> 02:33:05.44
This smuggler would just take the money and drive them around and around and a few circles and drop them back.

1402
02:33:05.44 --> 02:33:11.84
It sort of became this hotel California. You go in but you can never leave.

1403
02:33:12.48 --> 02:33:17.28
So that was sort of the recurring theme with the women. I found too that even if they wanted to,

1404
02:33:17.28 --> 02:33:26.40
they couldn't. Colah Ahmed, a 43-year-old, departed Karachi Pakistan with her husband,

1405
02:33:26.40 --> 02:33:30.80
and children of fight for the Syrian people. My husband was distraught after seeing a unicef

1406
02:33:31.36 --> 02:33:37.20
documentary about the war in Syria. He wanted to go fight Bashar. My husband sold our house and

1407
02:33:37.20 --> 02:33:42.80
all our things for us to leave. He used to be a normal man, work in telecommunications,

1408
02:33:42.80 --> 02:33:47.28
but he saw that documentary and he made it mind to change.

1409
02:33:47.28 --> 02:33:58.16
And like you've been saying, that's what kind of underlying issues were in his head.

1410
02:33:59.04 --> 02:34:06.08
What's going on? Could he not get ahead at work? Was he not getting the support that he needed? What was going on?

1411
02:34:07.12 --> 02:34:09.20
You have to add in all these other factors.

1412
02:34:09.20 --> 02:34:24.08
Another one. This is a male born to Moroccan parents and the idyllic countryside just outside

1413
02:34:24.08 --> 02:34:28.96
of Brussels. Homsa was well known in his community, revered for soccer and boxing skills. His last

1414
02:34:28.96 --> 02:34:37.44
job was with DHL, delivery service. Homsa admitted that in 2011 he became more militant in his

1415
02:34:37.44 --> 02:34:43.76
ideological views after being introduced to a solid fist group called Sharia for Belgium.

1416
02:34:44.64 --> 02:34:49.84
The group called for the overthrow of democracy and urged young people to join ISIS abroad.

1417
02:34:49.84 --> 02:34:53.84
Almost two years after he headed, he did the call and set out for the battlefield. The

1418
02:34:53.84 --> 02:34:57.60
organization would be formally designated as a terrorist group by the Belgian state.

1419
02:34:58.40 --> 02:35:02.24
Homsa was first place at an immigrant's location in the opposition

1420
02:35:02.24 --> 02:35:09.68
bastion of Idlib where he was housed alongside several western fighters. After two weeks he

1421
02:35:09.68 --> 02:35:15.68
spent, he was sent for 40 days of training. Weapons, fitness, religious doctrine. After that he

1422
02:35:15.68 --> 02:35:21.60
was deployed to the northern city of Alepo to fight. I just wanted to give people some kind of

1423
02:35:23.20 --> 02:35:30.56
indication. Homsa, particularly remember the ISIS celebrations after the 2014

1424
02:35:30.56 --> 02:35:36.88
be heading of American journalist James Foley and how leaders used the gruesome event as motivation.

1425
02:35:36.88 --> 02:35:42.96
It was to say, look how we are fighting the Americans. He continued underscoring that ISIS

1426
02:35:42.96 --> 02:35:48.32
initially gained momentum after the formation of a coalition of over 60 Allied nations designated

1427
02:35:48.32 --> 02:35:54.16
to defeat them. Designed to defeat them. The coalition's creation was spun by the ISIS propaganda

1428
02:35:54.16 --> 02:35:59.84
machine to show how strong the militant group was against such a massive force. Homsa repeatedly

1429
02:35:59.84 --> 02:36:06.32
emphasized in the interview that the ideology driving ISIS was not going to stop and had permeated

1430
02:36:06.32 --> 02:36:13.84
some circles so profoundly that it would be next to impossible to defeat. He also said each new

1431
02:36:13.84 --> 02:36:18.64
incarnation of the group brought a school of thought even more rigid than its predecessor.

1432
02:36:20.24 --> 02:36:26.16
A central tenant of ISIS brainwashing of new followers was its singular focus on the United

1433
02:36:26.16 --> 02:36:34.24
States. Homsa said in what he described as an obsession with America. It was the big enemy.

1434
02:36:45.20 --> 02:36:48.80
Got to have somebody to fight against. I've got to have a bad guy.

1435
02:36:48.80 --> 02:36:57.84
Where the good guys you got to have a bad guy? America makes a very nice bad guy for a much

1436
02:36:57.84 --> 02:37:04.24
of the world. There's always going to be a different cause. That's what I always found to

1437
02:37:04.24 --> 02:37:13.28
is that I'll use the example of Gantonamo Bay. You could close that down but they're going

1438
02:37:13.28 --> 02:37:24.80
to find another cause. There's always going to be a reason. I think we close one thing down.

1439
02:37:27.04 --> 02:37:30.64
Create a Palestinian state. Whatever the reason is there's always going to be another one.

1440
02:37:30.64 --> 02:37:36.08
That's something that I think people don't really want to recognize. When it comes to policies

1441
02:37:36.08 --> 02:37:42.88
that you can't have these arbitrary lines between war and peace necessarily. Those days are long

1442
02:37:42.88 --> 02:37:50.40
on. With terrorist groups like this, it's just something that I think we have to learn to manage

1443
02:37:50.40 --> 02:37:55.36
to some degree and I hate saying that because I want to be able to say that it can be totally

1444
02:37:55.36 --> 02:38:09.12
defeated but I don't think that's realistic. I think maybe I hope.

1445
02:38:09.12 --> 02:38:26.80
Maybe I just hope but I always hope that human beings intrinsic motivation for freedom

1446
02:38:30.08 --> 02:38:36.16
will rise eventually to a very positive place in the world.

1447
02:38:36.16 --> 02:38:48.08
I hope so too. I really do. I'm not even sure I believe my own hope. That's what my hope is.

1448
02:38:48.08 --> 02:38:57.52
I said I hope. And what's unfortunate is you see various places in the world where freedom

1449
02:38:57.52 --> 02:39:03.44
rises and that my theory would be that once it rises it's going to move forward.

1450
02:39:03.44 --> 02:39:13.12
Unfortunately we see it received. I ran to great example. The freedom in Iran in the 60s and 70s

1451
02:39:13.12 --> 02:39:17.68
was completely on the rise and it absolutely receded.

1452
02:39:17.68 --> 02:39:21.68
Totally. Maybe my hope is misplaced.

1453
02:39:21.68 --> 02:39:27.36
I think in Syria and in the beginning with the revolution in the Arab Spring, there were freedom

1454
02:39:27.36 --> 02:39:35.12
and there was a legitimate movement of wanting a better life that wasn't under the Bashar al-Assad

1455
02:39:35.12 --> 02:39:40.16
dictatorship. But what happened was it got hijacked by a lot of these terrorist groups and

1456
02:39:40.16 --> 02:39:45.44
Jahada, so then I guess diluted that opposition and then it became this very again. It wasn't

1457
02:39:45.44 --> 02:39:53.28
black and white. It was an incredibly complicated mixture of opposition with a lot of them being

1458
02:39:53.28 --> 02:39:58.88
good solid wanting to live a better life and then a lot of them being these awful terrorists.

1459
02:40:01.36 --> 02:40:04.64
That in self was something I think was really hijacked and diluted.

1460
02:40:06.48 --> 02:40:13.92
Yeah that story and you do a very good job in this of kind of showing some of those strange alliances.

1461
02:40:13.92 --> 02:40:19.52
Very strange alliances that took place and what do you make of those strange alliances?

1462
02:40:19.52 --> 02:40:24.40
Who are you aligned with and wait a second? What happens when we're done with this job and

1463
02:40:24.40 --> 02:40:28.24
all of a sudden I look my person that just helped me and realized that they've got a whole

1464
02:40:28.24 --> 02:40:29.84
other idea where they're heading?

1465
02:40:33.68 --> 02:40:39.84
I mean around work to defeat ISIS too. And look at how the US policy is with Iran. I mean

1466
02:40:40.72 --> 02:40:44.80
the friend of the friend is not your is your enemy or not.

1467
02:40:44.80 --> 02:40:51.44
Yeah exactly that's what thing is that old saying is that saying just goes around in circles.

1468
02:40:53.44 --> 02:40:58.96
You know I'm gonna I'm gonna fast forward past some of these wars. I'm gonna I'm gonna pass the

1469
02:41:00.64 --> 02:41:06.72
past the battle. You know you detail some of the stuff of the musul and you definitely talk about

1470
02:41:06.72 --> 02:41:15.60
rock and insuria and I'm gonna fast forward and again I'm just gonna I have to otherwise I just

1471
02:41:15.60 --> 02:41:23.36
hit here and read this entire book and I don't want to have you here forever but we get to a point

1472
02:41:23.36 --> 02:41:29.28
where the cleanup is now happening and this is at the end of the book and the cleanup is happening

1473
02:41:29.28 --> 02:41:38.56
in the musule and in this particular case there's cleanup happening in in Tallah Far.

1474
02:41:38.56 --> 02:41:45.76
And I'll just go to the book 40 miles west of musule Tallah Far had a population of about

1475
02:41:45.76 --> 02:41:50.32
a hundred thousand before being captured by ISIS in June of 2014. The city was liberated in

1476
02:41:50.32 --> 02:41:56.40
October of 2017 remnants of war were everywhere. bodies found around and under homes I learned

1477
02:41:56.40 --> 02:42:05.44
were not uncommon neither was the smell of future-fied flesh. In many cases families living under ISIS

1478
02:42:05.44 --> 02:42:12.48
rule were forced to bury bodies in their own homes and backyards as well as in local public squares.

1479
02:42:12.48 --> 02:42:21.12
Sometimes victims were made to dig their own shallow graves. The 43 person emergency division

1480
02:42:21.12 --> 02:42:28.80
was tasked only with removing civilian remains from mass graves. The larger 700 person

1481
02:42:28.80 --> 02:42:34.80
nivina civil defense corps was in charge of sweeping up bodies from the streets and collecting

1482
02:42:34.80 --> 02:42:39.68
them from individuals from individual from within individual homes.

1483
02:42:39.68 --> 02:42:51.52
The first wasted life to be reached up from the sewage was that of an Iraqi soldier.

1484
02:42:53.12 --> 02:42:58.72
His bones a blood-drenched uniform and a pair of handcuffs were exhumed.

1485
02:42:58.72 --> 02:43:07.52
Then came seven more all dragged from beneath a home that had once served as a local headquarters

1486
02:43:07.52 --> 02:43:14.64
of ISIS. Local officials who had been tipped off to the presence of the remains just a couple

1487
02:43:14.64 --> 02:43:22.08
days earlier said the victims were likely held in the basement. Across the street at a second location

1488
02:43:22.08 --> 02:43:31.60
another 12 decomposed civilian bodies were exhumed. Among the remains found were those of at least two

1489
02:43:31.60 --> 02:43:42.64
children and dismembered heads without bodies. Each skeleton bore a thick black-blind fold.

1490
02:43:42.64 --> 02:43:49.12
Most of the victims appeared to have been slain execution styles bullet-showered into the backs of their

1491
02:43:49.12 --> 02:43:58.64
heads. It was a massacre. More and more of the same one police official told me.

1492
02:44:00.96 --> 02:44:06.48
A police official always accompanied the recovery workers through their days work, a standard

1493
02:44:06.48 --> 02:44:11.84
practice. It's never ending. The official continued staring out into the yellow fog which lifted

1494
02:44:11.84 --> 02:44:18.56
into the bright sunshine as the day passed on. Officials had become all too familiar with the

1495
02:44:18.56 --> 02:44:27.84
discovery of ISIS victims. Our duty is to the innocent people under the rubble.

1496
02:44:30.32 --> 02:44:37.52
Said, how mighty Al Hussein commander of the Civil Defense Corps, emergency convoy unit he explained

1497
02:44:37.52 --> 02:44:45.44
to me over cold tea the night before ISIS kills them and throws them into the sewage one by one

1498
02:44:45.44 --> 02:44:54.32
and covers it over with cement. This is their way. After several grueling hours with small children

1499
02:44:54.32 --> 02:45:01.28
watching from low-lying rooftops above 20 body bags were sealed and handed over to Iraqi federal police.

1500
02:45:03.04 --> 02:45:08.96
Law enforcement took them to a specialized committee for examining the bodies whenever possible,

1501
02:45:08.96 --> 02:45:22.24
surviving family members of the victims were notified. For DaWad DaWood Salam Mood Ali, a 44-year-old

1502
02:45:22.24 --> 02:45:27.68
rescue worker from the zoo, considered something of a hero among his peers for excavating the

1503
02:45:27.68 --> 02:45:31.84
bodies for 27 years. It was a job that never got easier.

1504
02:45:31.84 --> 02:45:40.24
Sometimes it's five or six entire families all buried in one house. He told me after losing

1505
02:45:40.24 --> 02:45:44.64
after hoating himself off behind the fire truck at the end of a shift in Tallahafar.

1506
02:45:45.92 --> 02:45:49.76
As a father, especially when I see women and children, it hurts.

1507
02:45:52.16 --> 02:45:54.24
I've had to pull out many pregnant women too.

1508
02:45:54.24 --> 02:46:05.12
DaWood said he and his team had recovered 2,400 bodies since Missouil was liberated last July.

1509
02:46:05.52 --> 02:46:10.48
With more than 2,000 of those coming from the old city on the west side in Tallahafar,

1510
02:46:10.48 --> 02:46:14.40
they had recovered 640 bodies, many of whom were still unidentified.

1511
02:46:14.40 --> 02:46:23.76
Another 500 bodies were discovered last year in a mass grave between the two strongholds.

1512
02:46:25.92 --> 02:46:31.76
There wasn't just human recovery required of the dedicated team. Ali was also burned with

1513
02:46:31.76 --> 02:46:37.52
demining bodies, sometimes those of ISIS fighters. I can tell straight away if they are ISIS.

1514
02:46:38.24 --> 02:46:42.08
They are usually booby trapped and often have foreign passport strapped to them.

1515
02:46:42.08 --> 02:46:50.24
We don't remove them. Our command after demining them is to leave them and authorities take those.

1516
02:46:55.60 --> 02:47:00.96
I stood alone as the last of the lives were swathed in those big black bags.

1517
02:47:01.92 --> 02:47:04.88
Their brains bursting through empty eye sockets.

1518
02:47:04.88 --> 02:47:14.56
I tore off my surgical mask, heaving at the smell of rotting corpses in the unbearable heat.

1519
02:47:19.28 --> 02:47:27.44
Iraq stood still at the fork between a potential future of death and one that would value life.

1520
02:47:27.44 --> 02:47:35.04
It was a place that resembled a fractured mosaic that could only be put back together

1521
02:47:35.04 --> 02:47:40.40
by young generation who knew little of life not maimed by the brutality.

1522
02:47:44.48 --> 02:47:50.32
It was supposed to be a time after the war. It was supposed to be a time of peace.

1523
02:47:50.32 --> 02:47:56.80
Only all it felt like was strange and sorrowful.

1524
02:48:00.56 --> 02:48:05.60
I thought about that tried and true expression. We all tend to offer one another during hardships.

1525
02:48:08.48 --> 02:48:09.92
Everything happens for a reason.

1526
02:48:09.92 --> 02:48:25.76
No. There was no reason these young men and women had to die alone. Their bodies left to decay

1527
02:48:25.76 --> 02:48:32.80
in the literal bowels of their country. There was no great lesson to come from that.

1528
02:48:32.80 --> 02:48:40.96
No sense in that they had completed their mission on earth and no reason that it was there time to be taken by God.

1529
02:48:46.88 --> 02:48:48.56
That is the lie we tell ourselves.

1530
02:48:54.24 --> 02:49:00.96
A child from the neighborhood who had watched without flinching as the bodies were brought up

1531
02:49:00.96 --> 02:49:03.92
peered over what was left of the bond-out fence.

1532
02:49:09.20 --> 02:49:12.08
He looked through the gaping hole into my tearful eyes.

1533
02:49:19.36 --> 02:49:21.76
Soon we stopped crying for the dead he whispered.

1534
02:49:21.76 --> 02:49:29.68
But all we can do is cry for the living.

1535
02:49:29.68 --> 02:49:45.84
That too was war.

1536
02:49:45.84 --> 02:49:59.68
That is not quite the closing of the book but obviously it's the name of the book.

1537
02:50:05.76 --> 02:50:10.56
Like I said we probably covered five red, plus than five percent of the book today.

1538
02:50:10.56 --> 02:50:19.52
And these stories, every page, every story, just captures so much of this perspective that you are

1539
02:50:23.36 --> 02:50:25.52
trying to convey.

1540
02:50:25.52 --> 02:50:47.12
For me coming home from my experiences, for instance my first deployment to Iraq, we spent a

1541
02:50:47.12 --> 02:50:55.52
lot of time at home. At that time the enemy would attack from bridges.

1542
02:50:56.64 --> 02:51:08.48
When you drive underneath a bridge you would get a little stand by mode, get that little heightened awareness.

1543
02:51:09.20 --> 02:51:15.60
So when I got back to America you are driving and around Baghdad and much of Iraq they look

1544
02:51:15.60 --> 02:51:19.68
like highways in California. This is a big highway with signs.

1545
02:51:21.76 --> 02:51:27.52
There was when I first got back you would start to feel or a vehicle would get close because you

1546
02:51:27.52 --> 02:51:31.28
don't want vehicles close to your home, the convoy. You would see a vehicle coming close in for

1547
02:51:31.28 --> 02:51:36.88
that split second. Why does this guy get close to me? But the approaching that bridge and get that

1548
02:51:36.88 --> 02:51:46.32
little sensation of brace for it. So you have these memories I guess that stick with you.

1549
02:51:46.88 --> 02:51:49.36
And I've got a bunch of those different memories that stick with me.

1550
02:51:53.60 --> 02:52:01.92
What where are you at? What memories stick with you? Do you have trouble getting back to normal?

1551
02:52:01.92 --> 02:52:11.68
Do you have trouble with going to sleep at night? I think this was a project I worked on a few

1552
02:52:11.68 --> 02:52:18.64
years ago and I think there has been a little bit of distance from it for me. I remember being in

1553
02:52:18.64 --> 02:52:26.24
the middle of it and when I was still riding and covering it it was an obsession to try to

1554
02:52:26.24 --> 02:52:32.48
understand it to get the story right, to get the facts right and it was so all encompassing.

1555
02:52:33.20 --> 02:52:38.96
And coming back it it always took me a couple of weeks to kind of readjust but one of the biggest

1556
02:52:38.96 --> 02:52:46.72
sort of long-lasting impacts I was found in my experience was I think it was a sense of that

1557
02:52:47.44 --> 02:52:53.12
feeling a little bit unsafe but I would be in New York or LA. I was in living in both cities at the time.

1558
02:52:53.12 --> 02:53:00.72
And you get a fishing scam or something on your phone that everybody gets. And for me it was

1559
02:53:00.72 --> 02:53:05.52
oh my god I'm being targeted who wants something from me and I always I couldn't separate

1560
02:53:07.36 --> 02:53:12.32
and think of it as well everybody gets these. For me it just became this sort of I was convinced

1561
02:53:12.32 --> 02:53:18.48
everybody was tapping into my phone or and for me it was more of the I couldn't see this sort of

1562
02:53:18.48 --> 02:53:24.000
enemy and that took me a while to kind of let go of that a little bit and to be like

1563
02:53:25.20 --> 02:53:30.72
you know you're okay nobody's coming at you now nobody's trying to hack into your emails

1564
02:53:30.72 --> 02:53:35.36
nobody's trying to figure out who you're talking to on this particular day or maybe they were but

1565
02:53:35.92 --> 02:53:41.60
you know it definitely was something I'd exaggerated I think in my head. So that's something I've

1566
02:53:41.60 --> 02:53:49.84
had to have separation from and I think that I've done that but I still I think about it a lot

1567
02:53:49.84 --> 02:53:55.12
I think about you know a lot of the people that I meant and think you know I try to find out

1568
02:53:56.08 --> 02:54:00.24
where they are what they're doing I think today with all these you know what's app signal

1569
02:54:00.96 --> 02:54:06.48
encrypted messaging you stay in contact with these people a lot and that's something that

1570
02:54:06.48 --> 02:54:12.000
a previous journalist and different generations didn't have so today which is lovely you can

1571
02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:18.24
still sort of stay in contact with them and their families and then but it also is that

1572
02:54:19.44 --> 02:54:24.16
you do sort of feel helpless because there's not much you can do and I dedicate this book to

1573
02:54:25.44 --> 02:54:30.72
it was a family that I stayed within in Syria and they live in a place called Cubani and it was

1574
02:54:30.72 --> 02:54:36.32
sort of one of the big I sister-ung holds in the beginning and they you know they took me in and

1575
02:54:36.32 --> 02:54:41.68
you create these immediate bonds with people because you know they were my immediate sort of family

1576
02:54:42.32 --> 02:54:47.44
and they had two young sons and uh mezzles wife, Parashan was pregnant at the time and they said

1577
02:54:47.44 --> 02:54:53.44
oh when I left and we gone through all these you know experiences and and when I left they said oh well

1578
02:54:53.44 --> 02:54:59.04
if she's a if we have a daughter we're gonna name a holly and I just sort of smiled and I thought

1579
02:54:59.04 --> 02:55:03.92
that was really endearing and lovely sure enough a few months later I get a message and a picture

1580
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:08.48
that she had a girl and they named a holly's fault the same as me and I was funny and I tried

1581
02:55:08.48 --> 02:55:13.92
to sort of check in I can't even send them a copy of the book I can't send them you know anything

1582
02:55:14.72 --> 02:55:19.92
but I tried to check in you know with them and it was really sweet because they said

1583
02:55:19.92 --> 02:55:26.16
oh there's about five holly's in Cubani now so it's kind of this funny little trend and I was just so

1584
02:55:26.16 --> 02:55:34.32
I was so undid by it and I think it's those moments in life where you create bonds with people

1585
02:55:34.96 --> 02:55:40.40
and they want nothing from you they're not trying to get anything from you they're not trying to

1586
02:55:40.40 --> 02:55:46.88
have their name and a newspaper they're not trying to to do any of that they just want to protect you

1587
02:55:46.88 --> 02:55:54.24
and it's such a rare thing in this day and age to have those relationships that you know

1588
02:55:54.24 --> 02:55:59.52
aren't transactional in some way other than it just comes from a place that is so pure and I think

1589
02:55:59.52 --> 02:56:04.40
that's also why I was so attracted to the work because you're really meeting people in their

1590
02:56:04.40 --> 02:56:11.20
most authentic state and I think that's just a huge thing I've tried to do in my in my life at home

1591
02:56:11.20 --> 02:56:17.44
too is it's to really weed out you know what what doesn't serve me as a human being and and

1592
02:56:18.16 --> 02:56:23.68
look for those authentic relationships and that's one of the biggest takeaways for me in working

1593
02:56:23.68 --> 02:56:32.72
in those hormones. I remember when when I got back from my last deployment and then I retired

1594
02:56:34.08 --> 02:56:41.36
and I you know we talked to guys and see stories about guys that would that guys that were

1595
02:56:41.36 --> 02:56:45.44
in Vietnam more and they go back to Vietnam and then when I started doing the podcast we met guys

1596
02:56:46.24 --> 02:56:50.80
that had gone back to Vietnam and I read more stories about guys that had gone back to Vietnam

1597
02:56:50.80 --> 02:56:55.36
and then you know you can take it to the the guys that weren't World War II that would go back

1598
02:56:55.36 --> 02:57:03.28
to the beaches of Normandy and and I remember thinking to myself as far as going back to Iraq

1599
02:57:03.28 --> 02:57:09.04
especially when I first got home this is I don't want to go back there don't want to go back

1600
02:57:09.04 --> 02:57:15.68
there no I'm never going back there only recently have I started to feel think to myself you know

1601
02:57:15.68 --> 02:57:23.12
it would be kind of cold of a back and walk those streets again do where where are you at?

1602
02:57:24.40 --> 02:57:30.48
Oh I was I was planning to go back just before I covered lockdown I read a reason ago and then I

1603
02:57:30.48 --> 02:57:35.68
was approached to even go I think like in a couple of weeks to go and I had to sort of turn it down

1604
02:57:35.68 --> 02:57:41.68
because for different reasons but oh yeah in a heartbeat I feel like Iraq is sort of just

1605
02:57:41.68 --> 02:57:47.68
a yeah it's kind of a second home really you know it's been a little bit since I've been there but

1606
02:57:48.24 --> 02:57:56.000
I have nothing but sort of a desire to still go there I don't I don't view it as a place that I

1607
02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:03.20
never want to go again yeah I'm slowly getting through that maybe because I don't have

1608
02:58:04.96 --> 02:58:10.24
a lot of things I don't really like my memories of it a lot of them are great memories that's

1609
02:58:10.24 --> 02:58:14.96
what makes me start you know I used to say to the platoon guys like you're going through things while

1610
02:58:14.96 --> 02:58:19.12
you're on deployment and you're mad about this and you're mad at that guy and you're mad at this other

1611
02:58:19.12 --> 02:58:22.72
guy and I said you know what two weeks after we get home we're gonna forget all those bad stuff

1612
02:58:22.72 --> 02:58:27.44
just remember the good stuff and sure enough as time goes by you just remember the good stuff so I think

1613
02:58:27.44 --> 02:58:32.88
I'm getting there with specifically with the city of Ramadi and it was really I mean obviously it was

1614
02:58:32.88 --> 02:58:42.88
heart-wrenching to see that when Ramadi got taken over by ISIS and the the the block flag of ISIS

1615
02:58:42.88 --> 02:58:48.48
flying over the government center which I know so many people had fought so hard to liberate that city

1616
02:58:48.48 --> 02:58:55.52
and it was doing so well and then it got smashed by ISIS I remember there's pictures of

1617
02:58:55.52 --> 02:59:04.72
after after the Iraqi soldiers went back in they annihilated Ramadi they blew up so many buildings there was

1618
02:59:04.72 --> 02:59:11.44
a neighborhood called Tamim on in Western Western Ramadi and they I saw pictures of it it was just

1619
02:59:11.44 --> 02:59:15.20
leveled building after building after building because they just every building that they thought might

1620
02:59:15.20 --> 02:59:20.000
have a mind they blew it up and guess what they thought about they all had IDs so they blew them all up

1621
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:29.84
but yeah I think you have a much better relationship with the land and the people and the memories

1622
02:59:29.84 --> 02:59:36.88
than I do right yeah and for me it really is it comes down to the people it does it's it's the people who

1623
02:59:38.72 --> 02:59:46.32
who I mean what a privilege it is to to for these people to just to trust you enough with some of

1624
02:59:46.32 --> 02:59:52.000
these stories to be that vulnerable with somebody that they don't know you know at least initially

1625
02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:59.20
and I think that's that's something I take as an honor really to be able to to be some kind of

1626
02:59:59.20 --> 03:00:05.44
vessel in in telling that for me you know I hate to use the word voice when people say it's a voice

1627
03:00:05.44 --> 03:00:10.56
of a voice let's say no they have a voice but but I think as a journalist you you're awesome kind of

1628
03:00:10.56 --> 03:00:18.08
vessel that can can bring that back and and tell that and I can't do anything really beyond that

1629
03:00:18.08 --> 03:00:23.84
I think that was also something I had to learn was that you want to be able to think that a story is

1630
03:00:23.84 --> 03:00:28.16
going to make a difference it's going to change the answer you know some law makers mind somewhere

1631
03:00:28.16 --> 03:00:33.20
and something's going to happen and you know 99.9% of the time it doesn't change anything but

1632
03:00:33.20 --> 03:00:39.44
doesn't make it any you know less important to do and be once you take that weight off your shoulders

1633
03:00:40.56 --> 03:00:45.76
it's so much easier to do your job because again it's that clear mandate you know what it is

1634
03:00:45.76 --> 03:00:51.76
that you're doing and everything else after that is out of your hands and not in the description

1635
03:00:53.84 --> 03:00:58.64
well that's a probably a great place to wrap this up because what you've absolutely done in this book is

1636
03:00:58.64 --> 03:01:06.08
you have told their stories and we will pass these stories on to as many people as we can

1637
03:01:07.52 --> 03:01:13.92
and I think like Haley love said you know you've got what your talent is right you've got your

1638
03:01:13.92 --> 03:01:20.48
skill in life and Haley love can make videos and sing and and you've got this ability to write and share

1639
03:01:20.48 --> 03:01:34.96
these stories and that's what you've done so echo you got anything I know Haley that we can find you

1640
03:01:35.84 --> 03:01:44.08
well the book will be up on the website if you want to order the book on Twitter and on Instagram

1641
03:01:44.08 --> 03:01:51.36
you are Haley I he is I don't weird spelling for him I he I guess it's it's slightly unusual okay my mum was having a moment

1642
03:01:51.36 --> 03:01:59.12
Haley S McCann McCay McCay on and on Facebook there's no S just Haley McCay and you also have

1643
03:01:59.12 --> 03:02:05.04
Haley McCay dot com yes so put it up there yep so people can go there and check out what you're up to

1644
03:02:05.04 --> 03:02:09.44
which is next project be in the next so I'm working on a few different things so I have a couple of

1645
03:02:09.44 --> 03:02:17.12
writing projects that I am nodding out the the basis on it's it's going to be quite a journey and I'm

1646
03:02:17.12 --> 03:02:22.40
waiting for trouble to open up but I'm sort of looking a little bit more into the survival aspect of it

1647
03:02:23.60 --> 03:02:31.04
so yeah so that'll be interesting and I am yeah just kind of focused on that for now and sort of

1648
03:02:31.04 --> 03:02:36.80
doing a lot more sort of geopolitical stuff as well so it's kind of branching out.

1649
03:02:36.80 --> 03:02:42.40
Do you write do you are you writing news anymore on a regular basis? I'm doing a little bit here and there

1650
03:02:42.96 --> 03:02:47.68
but I'm really focused on my more long-term projects right now kind of getting down a little bit

1651
03:02:47.68 --> 03:02:53.60
more to the new degree and the things that I I really see is important as opposed to the daily

1652
03:02:53.60 --> 03:02:59.20
turn so I'm sort of taking a bit of a leap in that so it's nice. How is the book writing process

1653
03:02:59.20 --> 03:03:06.72
did you like it? I you always have a love hate with you know but most of the time I really love

1654
03:03:06.72 --> 03:03:14.24
it and I I love being able to to I hate being having to decipher my handwriting out of a notebook

1655
03:03:14.24 --> 03:03:20.000
but beyond that I really love being able to kind of just sit and you sort of meditate on the

1656
03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:26.48
details and and I try to remember colors and faces and places and and all those things and try to

1657
03:03:26.48 --> 03:03:31.60
to put it into words and so it can be challenging definitely and it can be definitely moments that I

1658
03:03:31.60 --> 03:03:37.44
just I don't want you to go into it. Did you take pictures? I did I took a lot of pictures. So we need to

1659
03:03:37.44 --> 03:03:42.88
get those up on the web so yeah I'll get you pictures of whatever you need so a lot of these these people

1660
03:03:42.88 --> 03:03:51.76
they have they have a basis and places and yeah the you wrote a novel. I did when I was young

1661
03:03:52.32 --> 03:03:56.64
and what's up with the novel where it's a little I didn't I'm sure it's somewhere in Australia

1662
03:03:56.64 --> 03:04:02.48
probably in my dad's garage. It was a it was a sort of a young teen fiction novel yeah we

1663
03:04:02.48 --> 03:04:10.08
know he's going to that. I loved to write I was writing you know that's one thing aside from from my

1664
03:04:10.08 --> 03:04:15.44
ballet from a young age I love to tell those stories in a way that I love to write and make up

1665
03:04:15.44 --> 03:04:22.24
weed and wonderful things and yeah awesome awesome um anything else do you got anything else here?

1666
03:04:22.24 --> 03:04:27.76

1667
03:04:27.76 --> 03:04:34.40
happen in isolation so I have a wonderful family back home in Australia my parents have always been

1670
03:04:46.72 --> 03:04:53.12

03:05:32.72 --> 03:05:44.72
Thank you I appreciate it and I look I I hope I didn't come off as um crazy or arrogant or like

1678
03:05:44.72 --> 03:05:50.96
a jerk when I was talking about the fact that we we do some crazy stuff when we're young and there's

1679
03:05:50.96 --> 03:05:58.48
a certain amount of being naive but I don't care how naive you are or how naive you were

1680
03:05:58.48 --> 03:06:04.000
for you to go into these places to capture these stories and I didn't there's there's plenty of

1681
03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:10.56
stories in there where I know from being in combat myself how close you were to the front lines

1682
03:06:11.12 --> 03:06:16.64
how close you how much danger you were in all the time so thank you for writing the book but also

1683
03:06:16.64 --> 03:06:22.80
thank you for your courage and your bravery to go out there take these risks to capture these

1684
03:06:22.80 --> 03:06:31.76
stories to capture the horrors of war so that hopefully we as a race of people in the world

1685
03:06:32.96 --> 03:06:39.76
can learn to avoid it at all costs absolutely thank you Holly thank you thank you both

1686
03:06:42.16 --> 03:06:51.28
and with that Holly has left the building and left us with an incredible book with some

1687
03:06:51.28 --> 03:07:00.000
incredible accounts in it so definitely check out that book a lot of horror in that book

1688
03:07:02.08 --> 03:07:09.44
a lot of horror in the world yeah yeah it's bad how like like she'll describe each detail and

1689
03:07:09.44 --> 03:07:13.60
it goes along with kind of what we've been saying a lot where it's like yeah when you just individualized

1690
03:07:13.60 --> 03:07:18.40
one thing and see their story it's like oh man it really opens up this perspective of like man

1691
03:07:18.40 --> 03:07:26.32
this is bad yeah and by the way this is 430 something page book you know and I probably

1692
03:07:26.32 --> 03:07:36.08
read 20 pages something like that so it's an awesome book and yeah check it out a lot of horror

1693
03:07:36.08 --> 03:07:43.28
a lot of horror in the book a lot of horror in the world I kind of feel like we should do our best

1694
03:07:43.28 --> 03:07:52.24
to bring some good in the world starting with our own lives trying to live a good life

1695
03:07:54.24 --> 03:08:00.56
start there yeah kind of be appreciative to you know oh yeah I didn't bring it up Holly

1696
03:08:02.08 --> 03:08:09.76
just you know um living on the floor of some random blown out building she's getting after it man

1697
03:08:09.76 --> 03:08:16.000
she's getting after she doesn't she she talks about it but it's not that's what it's very

1698
03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:23.44
humbly written story because it's not about her yeah yeah it's not about her it's about the people

1699
03:08:23.44 --> 03:08:31.92
and so with that it's yeah yeah very cool yeah that says kind of a lot too but in author says

1700
03:08:31.92 --> 03:08:37.84
they don't make it about themselves because she could she could oh this could 100% this could be a

1701
03:08:37.84 --> 03:08:44.16
book about her yeah 100% I went here and I did this I did that it's not that that's not what the

1702
03:08:44.16 --> 03:08:51.12
book is I thought my life in thought to be over it in fact I had to drag it out of her I had to drag

1703
03:08:51.12 --> 03:08:55.36
out of her where she came from and how it started and how she got there she just jumped right into it

1704
03:08:55.36 --> 03:09:02.72
and what you just said about I was here and I was there she'll be talking about it and I can tell

1705
03:09:02.72 --> 03:09:08.32
what she means but a lot of people it's gonna you she said you know their explosion happened here

1706
03:09:08.32 --> 03:09:12.96
you know what I'm thinking okay I know what's happening there there's gunfire going on

1707
03:09:12.96 --> 03:09:18.72
that's not she just kind of puts it under the right under the radar kind of her ammo is to be

1708
03:09:18.72 --> 03:09:28.64
under the radar so yeah so yeah yeah we do have to be appreciative for sure we're like even at like

1709
03:09:28.64 --> 03:09:37.28
even if you're not involved in the war in these places even like a similar feather you are

1710
03:09:37.28 --> 03:09:43.92
being appreciative of that yeah because like your day-to-day life here versus day-to-day life there

1711
03:09:43.92 --> 03:09:49.04
even best case scenarios brought to different your worst kid your worst day here is better than your

1712
03:09:49.04 --> 03:09:56.96
best day there for 99% of the population if not more oh yeah so yeah it's man make the best of it's

1713
03:09:56.96 --> 03:10:03.92
one of those deals right anyway all right so yes let's not let our lives and capabilities go to

1714
03:10:03.92 --> 03:10:09.12
waste in any way let's try not to how about that I can't you know intention is a big deal

1715
03:10:09.12 --> 03:10:13.60
it is just knowing these things that's a that's a huge start you know like G. I. Joe

1716
03:10:13.60 --> 03:10:17.12
and I'm going to G. I. Joe what they'd say knowing he's half the battle

1717
03:10:18.56 --> 03:10:23.44
did G. I. Joe actually say that I thought that was Sun Sue and 25,000, 2500 years ago

1718
03:10:23.44 --> 03:10:31.60
no yeah Joe that's probably what's on. This clear yeah sir so yeah so you gotta keep these things in

1719
03:10:31.60 --> 03:10:36.16
mind did you work out today if you're like oh wait did I work out you gotta know these can't

1720
03:10:36.16 --> 03:10:40.08
stuff and you gotta know whether or not you're working out tomorrow so you're saying working out is

1721
03:10:40.08 --> 03:10:45.52
important definitely and yes I did work out today yes so you work out every day right

1722
03:10:45.52 --> 03:10:52.72
I do like that's that's the that's the jam. Yeah I'd done recently incorporated that into my whole thing

1723
03:10:52.72 --> 03:10:58.16
usually I'd have a five day and then to rest day situation who rest days back to back yes sir

1724
03:10:58.16 --> 03:11:02.80
like usually the weekend because of my program goes five days at a time like week by week and that's

1725
03:11:02.80 --> 03:11:08.40
just how it is convenient and it is convenient but it had that was it even before even before I was

1726
03:11:08.40 --> 03:11:12.72
going to need a rest day's or nothing like that or had less one had less going on what I'm saying

1727
03:11:12.72 --> 03:11:18.96
so that was the the structured program but I found that if you sort of spread it out little bit more

1728
03:11:18.96 --> 03:11:23.68
and I try to go hard to on every single day like hard at least one thing hard you know some

1729
03:11:23.68 --> 03:11:28.000
people that like oh yeah seven days but like this one or two days like it's like a mobility day

1730
03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:34.48
well I might have depending on how I feel I can I can tell when I've beat myself down to where I need

1731
03:11:34.48 --> 03:11:40.96
a co-op mobility day for sure oh you just try and break a sweat yeah like just at a minimum just you

1732
03:11:40.96 --> 03:11:45.84
know at a minimum I'm gonna break a sweat yeah seeing that and you know there's there's a

1733
03:11:45.84 --> 03:11:50.64
bunch of different effective philosophies in working out and working out programs so like again I'm

1734
03:11:50.64 --> 03:11:56.16
not saying oh yours I know the few as good as mine I'm not saying that at all but I found and currently

1735
03:11:56.16 --> 03:12:03.68
what I'm currently on is the to do something hard like hard where your body has to be like hey we

1736
03:12:03.68 --> 03:12:08.64
got to recover from this whether be like a one small body part situation even like a met

1737
03:12:08.64 --> 03:12:13.92
concentration like that just at least one thing I like that on these kind of one-off days you

1738
03:12:13.92 --> 03:12:18.48
a normal workout day as hard it's it's gonna be a hard one oh you're saying on that easier

1739
03:12:18.48 --> 03:12:23.84
day you're still gonna do one thing hard hard yeah I like it I actually do a very similar version

1740
03:12:23.84 --> 03:12:28.88
of that not consciously but unconsciously yeah so let's say I'm going a little bit let's say I'm

1741
03:12:28.88 --> 03:12:34.56
not going super hard metcon style but I'm gonna probably go heavy or if I'm going heavy or if I'm

1742
03:12:34.56 --> 03:12:39.04
getting not really like feeling the metcon I'll have you somewhere yeah so I guess we're kind of in the

1743
03:12:39.04 --> 03:12:44.72
same boat yeah it keeps your body there trying to you know to it trying to adapt adapt and get you know

1744
03:12:44.72 --> 03:12:50.96
kind of rebuild itself as the new and improved version you know and so hopefully we can kind of

1745
03:12:51.68 --> 03:12:57.68
take this philosophy and apply it to the our whole life hopefully same but here's a thing keep in mind

1746
03:12:57.68 --> 03:13:01.68
we might need some supplementation from time to time you don't get you don't get

1747
03:13:01.68 --> 03:13:10.80
nine hours asleep every single night you know you don't you don't max max molly nine hours

1748
03:13:10.80 --> 03:13:16.000
because it's something everybody's different so you don't you don't recover max you don't

1749
03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:20.88
maximize your recovery every single day okay once well you need some supplementation

1750
03:13:20.88 --> 03:13:25.04
for sure you need some supplementation in fact you got a little supplementation routine boom

1751
03:13:25.04 --> 03:13:31.28
you're gonna be on the track even quicker faster more effectively the worries jockel has some

1752
03:13:31.28 --> 03:13:36.16
supplementation jockel feel so here it is you need protein supplementation got milk

1753
03:13:36.96 --> 03:13:41.60
tastes like a dessert by the way I've been on that train for about a almost a month now

1754
03:13:43.28 --> 03:13:50.000
I forgot I forgot the joy the glory so actually going rewind just a little bit so all this stuff

1755
03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:55.12
you can be on a subscription yeah we mentioned it before but the subscription you will

1756
03:13:55.12 --> 03:14:02.24
not have to pay shipping right you will not have to remember to take these less fun ones to

1757
03:14:02.24 --> 03:14:06.96
take and I'll mean less fun like they're like anti fun I'm just saying the difference between

1758
03:14:06.96 --> 03:14:13.12
taking a milkshake drinking a milkshake and taking joint warfare or super cruel oil like one

1759
03:14:13.12 --> 03:14:18.16
has like a pleasurable experience one is kind of like okay you just sort of do it one's prolonged

1760
03:14:18.16 --> 03:14:23.44
pleasure when you don't have joint pain yeah but that's the delayed that's the delayed

1761
03:14:23.44 --> 03:14:30.56
great I'm just saying if you forget like it's a little bit more can be more of a thing anyway

1762
03:14:30.56 --> 03:14:33.92
check you got a subscription you don't have to even think about that kind of stuff

1763
03:14:34.72 --> 03:14:39.28
also do you get like a discount or something you get a discount or a little 10% discount

1764
03:14:39.28 --> 03:14:44.000
oh so please subscribe yeah yeah and free shipping so then you combine those two things together

1765
03:14:44.64 --> 03:14:49.76
we're in a good spot oh yeah so it's kind of a no brain wind yeah it's a no brainer if you're like

1766
03:14:49.76 --> 03:14:54.64
if you're taking it consistently which you should be trust me the difference between even that

1767
03:14:54.64 --> 03:14:59.68
taking it not taking it consistently night in day man so if you're doing it it's a win-win win really

1779
03:16:03.92 --> 03:16:11.28
in your jeans that is not 100% American maybe yeah crazy. In fact the jeans i can tell you there's

1780
03:16:11.28 --> 03:16:17.76

1781
03:16:17.76 --> 03:16:24.80

1785
03:16:43.44 --> 03:16:48.32
little bit stronger. We'll say it's stronger yes. Not the mains not strong but look

1786
03:16:48.32 --> 03:16:53.52
with who'd rather fight a war against main or a marathon. You know what I'm saying? I believe in

1787
03:16:53.52 --> 03:16:56.80
mains but yeah you're switching goods made. Right so i think we'll go with it. Well we'll go with

1788
03:16:56.80 --> 03:17:02.64
origin USA. Yes you're home. I agree. So yes also jocke was a store as well jocke store.

1789
03:17:02.64 --> 03:17:09.60
.com this is where you can get your discipline equals freedom shirts and hats and hoodies. Good

1790
03:17:10.32 --> 03:17:14.72
all kinds of cool stuff on there. You get the shirt i'm wearing right now. Yeah. You can get the jacket

1791
03:17:14.72 --> 03:17:18.96
that you're wearing exactly the jacket. Lightweight hoodie. You can get a lightweight hoodie that

1792
03:17:18.96 --> 03:17:25.28
echo Charles is wearing right now. It's lightweight hoodie weather. You're over taking on and off

1793
03:17:25.28 --> 03:17:29.84
your hoodie which I did. I'll do it just off. It's just off. Apparently it is. Because i'm

1794
03:17:29.84 --> 03:17:37.84
more of enough you showed up with it on. I showed up with mine on. Fine. Came in here.

1795
03:17:37.84 --> 03:17:41.52
Fine. You see I'm saying no. So all I'm going to tell you is that in the middle of the

1796
03:17:41.52 --> 03:17:46.32
bell curve you're good. If we go outside the bell curve and either direction you're out of

1797
03:17:46.32 --> 03:17:51.84
your luck. So if you get a little colder you're screwed and if it gets more hot you're screwed.

1798
03:17:52.48 --> 03:17:58.24
Yeah that's true. So guess it looks like I'm right. I like the aesthetic value that this lightweight

1799
03:17:58.24 --> 03:18:03.28
is. So you like some of us like this kind of stuff. Some of us are just over trying to win.

1800
03:18:03.28 --> 03:18:08.96
None of the words about how we look. None of the last. These things are available for those of us

1801
03:18:08.96 --> 03:18:16.72
who appreciate it. Speaking of appreciation if you can appreciate let's say one off designs or concepts

1802
03:18:16.72 --> 03:18:22.96
we call them layers from time to time on our apparel that we choose to wear because it looks good

1803
03:18:22.96 --> 03:18:30.16
and feels good. We have a little subscription situation as well. So it's the shirt locker. We've

1804
03:18:30.16 --> 03:18:35.20
landed on that name with Elbavococos creativity. No that was not my creativity. That was a

1805
03:18:35.20 --> 03:18:41.68
suggestion for the true book. I got your name the shirt locker because the name which I will not

1806
03:18:41.68 --> 03:18:47.84
mention because I don't want to hear it that echo Charles's lack of creativity. Yes. Okay.

1807
03:18:47.84 --> 03:18:52.72
Got us too. Well let's let's the name that will not be spoken. Shall not be spoken. Okay. Because now we

1808
03:18:52.72 --> 03:18:58.88
got something good. The shirt locker. So that is a monthly thing you get a new and new design. They're cool.

1809
03:18:58.88 --> 03:19:06.32
They're there. There's some layers. There's a attention and focus on the layers. So if you listen

1810
03:19:06.32 --> 03:19:13.84
you know and you're gonna this is like a crazy for you to be all this. It kind of is yes sir.

03:19:13.84 --> 03:19:20.000
But yeah, check that out. And if that seems cool, then that one might be for you as well.

1814
03:19:31.84 --> 03:19:36.96
is in the house. We should be rolling out with some of those grounded podcasts. Again,

1815
03:19:36.96 --> 03:19:44.64
working it, working it and the work your kid podcast, working it. I have some time coming up so we

1816
03:19:44.64 --> 03:19:52.48
should get some of those done. You can also join us at the Jockel Underground.com. Jockel Underground.com.

1817
03:19:53.12 --> 03:19:59.84
We have alternative podcasts with some amplifying information, some other subject matters,

1818
03:19:59.84 --> 03:20:04.72
some behind the scenes. We got some Q&A that were working on where you can send in your audio,

1819
03:20:04.72 --> 03:20:10.56
voice, video, thing and we'll put all that together. Also the underground, what I kind of notice

1820
03:20:10.56 --> 03:20:15.36
when I listen to them and stuff. These are like, I mean, I think it all, even the Jockel podcast.

1821
03:20:15.36 --> 03:20:20.88
Of course, like makes your brain like think and work and stuff. But it's like, I find myself like

1822
03:20:20.88 --> 03:20:26.72
doing little brain. It's like exercise for your brain almost, you know. You start to think about

1823
03:20:26.72 --> 03:20:31.12
stuff like, oh wait, do I do that? Oh wait, does that apply to me? Yeah, I would tell you that the

1824
03:20:31.12 --> 03:20:39.52
subject matter in the Jockel Underground podcast are based on me going through daily life and

1825
03:20:39.52 --> 03:20:48.48
recognizing the patterns and the maneuvers and the thoughts and the curiosity and, wait, why do

1826
03:20:48.48 --> 03:20:52.96
it, why did that happen? Why do we do that? And sometimes it doesn't fit into a Jockel podcast

1827
03:20:52.96 --> 03:20:57.76
because it's something about psychology or something about negotiate, whatever. Yeah.

1828
03:20:57.76 --> 03:21:03.84
Yeah. And so, but it's very important. And does it, it's like a venn diagram. Is there

1829
03:21:03.84 --> 03:21:07.04
some part of it that's leadership? Yes, there's some hundred that's the history. Yes, there's

1830
03:21:07.04 --> 03:21:12.08
some psychology. Some sociology out. It's all mixed in there. But what it's what it is, it's all

1831
03:21:12.08 --> 03:21:19.12
subject matter that will help you help to meet. It helps me. But it's me digging into and revealing

1832
03:21:19.12 --> 03:21:23.60
why these things are happening. Why am I doing these things? Sometimes my instincts are good.

1833
03:21:23.60 --> 03:21:28.80
Sometimes they're not good. But either way, I'm going to learn from it. And it's just the approach

1834
03:21:28.80 --> 03:21:32.96
that I take in life to try and figure something out because like to Jitsu, you know when you

1835
03:21:32.96 --> 03:21:37.28
change a Jitsu and someone goes, oh, put your arm here and you're like, okay, but then the next

1836
03:21:37.28 --> 03:21:40.88
day you don't really remember that. But if someone says, put your, put your arm here and here's

1837
03:21:40.88 --> 03:21:47.28
why you do it and you start to understand the concept. So I think that's a big part of the

1838
03:21:47.28 --> 03:21:53.84
Jockel underground podcast is what's the concept behind what's happening here? What makes it,

1839
03:21:53.84 --> 03:21:58.72
it like Jitsu obviously, a great analogy where like there's certain things in Jitsu and such a

1840
03:21:58.72 --> 03:22:06.24
quintely in life or your day to day, whatever that certain things are not intuitive. In fact,

1841
03:22:06.24 --> 03:22:10.64
they're counter-counted into like, you know, in Jitsu to turn your back, right? And like a

1842
03:22:10.64 --> 03:22:16.000
full, like there's so many reasons in regular life to like turn your back. That's the best

1843
03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:20.88
move it feels like it for moment to moment. Like if someone's mounted on you like turning your back,

1844
03:22:20.88 --> 03:22:24.72
if you never trained you Jitsu, it's weird. Basically, I want to get away. How do you get away,

1845
03:22:24.72 --> 03:22:28.96
turn your back and run away? Or you can't run into more than that ground. Yeah, like if you're

1846
03:22:28.96 --> 03:22:33.52
mounting, you try to stand up the most powerful way you can stand up is to turn over and stand

1847
03:22:33.52 --> 03:22:37.52
up with him on your back. You can't do a sit up with someone correct? You know, so it's like

1848
03:22:37.52 --> 03:22:41.04
there's all these intuitive things that are incorrect. That is going to make you lose.

1849
03:22:41.04 --> 03:22:46.40
And then it's the same thing with the like a lot of the weather, the cognitive biases or whatever.

1850
03:22:46.40 --> 03:22:50.24
It's kind of the same thing. Yeah, it's real interesting. You kind of explore them and you're like,

1851
03:22:50.24 --> 03:22:56.88
oh man, shoot out. And then you know what to do and what not to do. So that's the joccal wonderground.com.

1869
03:24:47.52 --> 03:24:55.12
know what it is. But we'll see. I've been getting warnings. People are going to critique you.

1870

Ashilon front is my leadership consultancy. We saw problems through leadership. If you

1876
03:25:26.80 --> 03:25:31.68
need help with leadership in your organization, go to Ashilonfront.com. We have EF online,

1877

Everyone inside your organization. And whatever problems you're having inside your organization,

1879
03:25:41.44 --> 03:25:45.36
the problems get solved through leadership as I just said, well, there's nothing better than

1880
03:25:45.36 --> 03:25:51.04
getting everyone on your team aligned around the same principles of leadership. It's

1881
03:25:51.04 --> 03:25:56.72
insane to think you would even try and run an organization without having everyone aligned

1882
03:25:56.72 --> 03:26:01.68
around the same principles of leadership. So go to EF online.com and start taking some courses.

Thank you for keeping us safe on the home front and everyone else out there.

You heard it today. There is a lot of evil in the world. It's everywhere.

1901
03:27:55.92 --> 03:28:02.24
And it's up to all of us to fight against it. That doesn't mean you have to pick up a gun.

1902
03:28:02.24 --> 03:28:07.84
Doesn't mean you have to pick up a weapon. Doesn't mean you have to go overseas. But you have to fight it.

1903
03:28:10.08 --> 03:28:16.56
And we have to make sure we keep it up bay by making sure we never forget that it's there.

1904
03:28:16.56 --> 03:28:28.80
And then what we need to do is go out every day and do good and bring light into the world.

1905
03:28:28.80 --> 03:28:36.64
And until next time, the Zekko and Jako out.
