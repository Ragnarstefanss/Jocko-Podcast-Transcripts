1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
with echo Charles and me, juggle willink, good evening echo.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:08.20
Good evening.

3
00:00:08.20 --> 00:00:15.92
The rumors started in the morning.

4
00:00:15.92 --> 00:00:20.16
Some guys in Afghanistan got hit.

5
00:00:20.16 --> 00:00:22.44
There's some wounded guys.

6
00:00:22.44 --> 00:00:26.44
And you don't know who it is at first.

7
00:00:26.44 --> 00:00:29.92
You don't know what team.

8
00:00:29.92 --> 00:00:32.92
These coasts, west coasts.

9
00:00:32.92 --> 00:00:36.68
You're just wondering.

10
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:40.88
Precime we know it's west coast guys.

11
00:00:40.88 --> 00:00:44.20
And you know the transition is happening.

12
00:00:44.20 --> 00:00:46.96
So you got two teams over there at the time.

13
00:00:46.96 --> 00:00:52.08
Team one and team seven.

14
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:58.000
And now you know you got wounded guys and you're thinking of who, who do I know?

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.12
And at this point, I kind of know everybody because I've been putting all these

16
00:01:03.12 --> 00:01:05.84
platoons through training for the last couple of years.

17
00:01:05.84 --> 00:01:13.24
So I know I'm gonna recognize names when they come through.

18
00:01:13.24 --> 00:01:17.76
And then you're waiting.

19
00:01:17.76 --> 00:01:21.000
And then we hear it's the one guy, it's only one guy.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.64
And that's good.

21
00:01:22.64 --> 00:01:23.64
You know, good.

22
00:01:23.64 --> 00:01:24.96
It's only one guy.

23
00:01:24.96 --> 00:01:27.96
How bad is he?

24
00:01:27.96 --> 00:01:31.80
And it doesn't sound good.

25
00:01:31.80 --> 00:01:37.24
And you're hearing reports is a massive ID.

26
00:01:37.24 --> 00:01:40.08
How bad.

27
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:41.08
Real bad.

28
00:01:41.08 --> 00:01:45.20
How bad is real bad.

29
00:01:45.20 --> 00:01:50.44
Real bad.

30
00:01:50.44 --> 00:01:57.64
And then you start to ask that horrible question to yourself, is he gonna make it?

31
00:01:57.64 --> 00:02:03.96
And then you start getting reports back.

32
00:02:03.96 --> 00:02:05.56
They don't know if he's gonna make it.

33
00:02:05.56 --> 00:02:11.56
And that's not a good sign because team guys are usually positive thinkers who we think

34
00:02:11.56 --> 00:02:14.56
we can survive anything.

35
00:02:14.56 --> 00:02:19.80
So when you hear a team guy say, he doesn't know if someone's gonna make it.

36
00:02:19.80 --> 00:02:26.36
It doesn't usually bode well.

37
00:02:26.36 --> 00:02:38.60
And there's a weird strange silence around everyone's kind of waiting to hear.

38
00:02:38.60 --> 00:02:43.80
And quite frankly, everyone's waiting to hear a name.

39
00:02:43.80 --> 00:02:46.44
And waiting to hear the outcome.

40
00:02:46.44 --> 00:02:52.24
And wondering if we're gonna lose a brother.

41
00:02:52.24 --> 00:02:57.16
And finally, I get an actual call.

42
00:02:57.16 --> 00:03:02.48
The distant voice from one of my buddies over in Afghanistan.

43
00:03:02.48 --> 00:03:06.92
And I get the first hand report of what's going on.

44
00:03:06.92 --> 00:03:12.92
And yeah, confirmed massive ID.

45
00:03:12.92 --> 00:03:15.68
I get the name, Dan Knollson.

46
00:03:15.68 --> 00:03:21.04
He's one of the cartoon commanders that I just put through work up.

47
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:27.28
Great guy, humble, tough, locked on.

48
00:03:27.28 --> 00:03:31.40
And I ask that question.

49
00:03:31.40 --> 00:03:35.56
You know, is he gonna make it?

50
00:03:35.56 --> 00:03:41.80
And the responses, you know, something along the lines of he lost both legs.

51
00:03:41.80 --> 00:03:47.72
And he's got massive trauma to his lower abdomen.

52
00:03:47.72 --> 00:03:51.64
He's like they have him stabilized, the guys did a great job.

53
00:03:51.64 --> 00:03:52.96
This is like a stall tactic.

54
00:03:52.96 --> 00:03:53.96
Not answering my question.

55
00:03:53.96 --> 00:03:58.72
Is he gonna make it?

56
00:03:58.72 --> 00:04:02.04
Then the answer comes again.

57
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:07.48
I don't know.

58
00:04:07.48 --> 00:04:12.44
And you sit with that for a while because there's only one thing that's going to give you

59
00:04:12.44 --> 00:04:13.44
the answer.

60
00:04:13.44 --> 00:04:15.80
And that's time.

61
00:04:15.80 --> 00:04:19.04
We time will tell.

62
00:04:19.04 --> 00:04:27.64
And in this particular case, we were blessed because Dan Knollson did make it.

63
00:04:27.64 --> 00:04:40.12
He survived a massive ID that would have killed probably anyone.

64
00:04:40.12 --> 00:04:42.76
But somehow he was able to survive.

65
00:04:42.76 --> 00:04:47.28
And we can talk about that because we're lucky enough tonight to have the honor of

66
00:04:47.28 --> 00:04:55.96
having Dan with us here to share some of his experiences and his lessons learned from his

67
00:04:55.96 --> 00:05:00.52
life and from his time in the Seal teams.

68
00:05:00.52 --> 00:05:04.08
Dan, thanks for coming by, man.

69
00:05:04.08 --> 00:05:05.08
Thanks for joining us.

70
00:05:05.08 --> 00:05:06.08
Thanks, Chaka.

71
00:05:06.08 --> 00:05:07.08
Thanks for having me here.

72
00:05:07.08 --> 00:05:16.000
I was one of those weird days at the teams where I remember this when you got blown up.

73
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.12
That this would happen.

74
00:05:18.12 --> 00:05:19.12
You guys would get wounded.

75
00:05:19.12 --> 00:05:20.96
You'd hear those rumors when you got to work.

76
00:05:20.96 --> 00:05:23.96
Someone saw a message traffic or someone talked to one of their friends.

77
00:05:23.96 --> 00:05:27.84
It would just get, you'd have so little information.

78
00:05:27.84 --> 00:05:34.32
And then as the day goes on, you sort of, the picture becomes more and more clear.

79
00:05:34.32 --> 00:05:40.44
And I really remember that well, you know, just because I was in trade at I'd already

80
00:05:40.44 --> 00:05:47.92
lost guys and was not looking forward to going to a funeral.

81
00:05:47.92 --> 00:05:51.36
So I'm freaking glad you're here, man.

82
00:05:51.36 --> 00:05:55.08
I'm glad you didn't have to go to that funeral.

83
00:05:55.08 --> 00:05:56.40
Let's start at the beginning, man.

84
00:05:56.40 --> 00:06:00.56
Let's start at where you came from and how you grew up and all that.

85
00:06:00.56 --> 00:06:01.72
Let's get to it.

86
00:06:01.72 --> 00:06:06.68
Sure, I'm born and raised in Kansas, fifth generation family farm.

87
00:06:06.68 --> 00:06:11.04
From 1874, I grew up roaming around outside.

88
00:06:11.04 --> 00:06:12.04
I had a baby gun.

89
00:06:12.04 --> 00:06:14.84
I got in a little bit of trouble with a baby gun shooting some targets.

90
00:06:14.84 --> 00:06:17.000
I shouldn't have even had.

91
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.16
But really, I think grown up on a farm in Kansas, I developed a deep-seated love of just

92
00:06:24.16 --> 00:06:25.16
being outside.

93
00:06:25.16 --> 00:06:28.12
I think this comes into play later in my story.

94
00:06:28.12 --> 00:06:30.76
Were you a, was your family a farming family?

95
00:06:30.76 --> 00:06:32.28
Is that what you did they did for a living?

96
00:06:32.28 --> 00:06:35.40
Yes, my, it's on my maternal side of the family.

97
00:06:35.40 --> 00:06:37.20
My mom's father.

98
00:06:37.20 --> 00:06:41.64
His, so my grandfather, his grandfather came out.

99
00:06:41.64 --> 00:06:44.40
This is homestead act 1870s a few days.

100
00:06:44.40 --> 00:06:48.12
Farm the land, you get to keep it after a certain amount of time.

101
00:06:48.12 --> 00:06:52.84
And they built the limestone home, limestone barn, still stands today.

102
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:54.20
That's where I was born and raised.

103
00:06:54.20 --> 00:06:55.20
I was a kid.

104
00:06:55.20 --> 00:06:56.20
I didn't think anything of it.

105
00:06:56.20 --> 00:06:57.20
Just where I grew up.

106
00:06:57.20 --> 00:06:59.80
But now I realize how special that was.

107
00:06:59.80 --> 00:07:02.32
Two hundred forty acres.

108
00:07:02.32 --> 00:07:04.64
And my grandfather had three daughters.

109
00:07:04.64 --> 00:07:05.88
I'm one of whom was my mother.

110
00:07:05.88 --> 00:07:08.32
And so the farming didn't get passed down.

111
00:07:08.32 --> 00:07:11.000
And I did not grow up as a farmer.

112
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.20
But I certainly took advantage of the tractor rides.

113
00:07:14.20 --> 00:07:19.72
I didn't, what was your, what was your grandparents in the military at all?

114
00:07:19.72 --> 00:07:23.68
My dad's father was US Army World War II.

115
00:07:23.68 --> 00:07:26.80
And I don't know, he, he is no longer alive.

116
00:07:26.80 --> 00:07:30.72
But I don't know the extent of action that he saw, but he was in the European theater in

117
00:07:30.72 --> 00:07:33.04
the later part of the war.

118
00:07:33.04 --> 00:07:34.72
And what about your dad?

119
00:07:34.72 --> 00:07:36.44
My father served in the Marine Corps.

120
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:40.72
He, in 1965, enlisted.

121
00:07:40.72 --> 00:07:43.60
He didn't get drafted.

122
00:07:43.60 --> 00:07:47.64
He chose to enlist in the, he chose to enlist in the Marine Corps.

123
00:07:47.64 --> 00:07:49.24
He did three tours.

124
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:54.84
And the third, and my father is no longer alive as well to talk about some of the specifics.

125
00:07:54.84 --> 00:07:57.60
And as a kid, when I grew up, he didn't talk about the specifics.

126
00:07:57.60 --> 00:08:03.76
But generally speaking, he gave me a glimpse of life into the Marine Corps, into the military.

127
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:07.48
And actually, I wanted to be a Marine in high school.

128
00:08:07.48 --> 00:08:14.04
My dad, at the end of his third tour, did one of these small teams where you're working

129
00:08:14.04 --> 00:08:18.84
with locals, kind of going village to village, four man teams.

130
00:08:18.84 --> 00:08:19.84
That's the last thing he did.

131
00:08:19.84 --> 00:08:24.52
And then he exited the Marine Corps in 1968 and was done.

132
00:08:24.52 --> 00:08:29.08
And he didn't, he didn't share much with you about that when he, not about combat.

133
00:08:29.08 --> 00:08:34.32
When I was a kid, I remember in our family room, we had some old storage items.

134
00:08:34.32 --> 00:08:36.04
And I was combing through this.

135
00:08:36.04 --> 00:08:37.04
This is as well.

136
00:08:37.04 --> 00:08:38.32
He was still alive.

137
00:08:38.32 --> 00:08:45.60
And I saw citations, Navy Commodation Medal, bronze, not, I'm certain, a purple heart.

138
00:08:45.60 --> 00:08:53.72
And he was under mortifier at one point and rendered life saving aid to a teammate, to

139
00:08:53.72 --> 00:08:54.72
another Marine.

140
00:08:54.72 --> 00:08:56.84
And so he's commended for that.

141
00:08:56.84 --> 00:08:58.76
But yeah, I don't have specifics.

142
00:08:58.76 --> 00:09:03.76
I also found some old letters that he had written, poem that were pretty interesting.

143
00:09:03.76 --> 00:09:09.84
Just to, you know, it's a glimpse into my father when he was 23, 24 years old, writing

144
00:09:09.84 --> 00:09:10.84
home from the old.

145
00:09:10.84 --> 00:09:11.84
What was he saying in the letters?

146
00:09:11.84 --> 00:09:12.84
He should have brought up a letter.

147
00:09:12.84 --> 00:09:18.36
I think there was some mention of R and R and probably don't need that.

148
00:09:18.36 --> 00:09:19.36
Go into this specific.

149
00:09:19.36 --> 00:09:21.76
I guess it depends who he was writing home.

150
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:22.76
Yeah.

151
00:09:22.76 --> 00:09:26.56
I was like, what do you do when you got out of the Marine Corps in 1968?

152
00:09:26.56 --> 00:09:30.80
So he ended up going to business school in Cornell.

153
00:09:30.80 --> 00:09:34.24
He did have a degree from Iowa, the States from Iowa.

154
00:09:34.24 --> 00:09:37.08
So he had a college degree in listening the Marine Corps.

155
00:09:37.08 --> 00:09:38.08
1968 gets out.

156
00:09:38.08 --> 00:09:41.88
He would have been 25 at that point, went to Cornell.

157
00:09:41.88 --> 00:09:45.32
And my mother listening the Marine Corps, even though he had a college degree.

158
00:09:45.32 --> 00:09:46.32
Yeah.

159
00:09:46.32 --> 00:09:50.32
Do you, are you tracking any, like, decision-making process on that?

160
00:09:50.32 --> 00:09:53.84
He just fired up for the Marine Corps?

161
00:09:53.84 --> 00:09:57.44
I think it was a little bit of rebellion against his father.

162
00:09:57.44 --> 00:10:01.36
And his father had said, if you're going to go in the military, do not go in the Marine

163
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:02.36
Corps.

164
00:10:02.36 --> 00:10:05.20
Any service, not that one.

165
00:10:05.20 --> 00:10:11.04
Well, yeah, if his dad served in World War II, he might have had that impression that

166
00:10:11.04 --> 00:10:14.64
hey, you don't want to be the Marine, you know, being the, you know, storming beaches over

167
00:10:14.64 --> 00:10:15.64
in the Pacific.

168
00:10:15.64 --> 00:10:20.88
You want to have a more plush job, like storming the beaches in the, in the European

169
00:10:20.88 --> 00:10:21.88
theater?

170
00:10:21.88 --> 00:10:22.88
I don't know.

171
00:10:22.88 --> 00:10:25.68
It's just a, so you think he rebel a little bit of a rebellion.

172
00:10:25.68 --> 00:10:32.16
Rebellion, I think, and I think he probably wanted to be part of something special.

173
00:10:32.16 --> 00:10:36.08
And I think that is something I've seen growing up on a farm in Kansas.

174
00:10:36.08 --> 00:10:40.52
I think you have work ethic, but you also want to be part of something special.

175
00:10:40.52 --> 00:10:42.40
You like to be part of a team.

176
00:10:42.40 --> 00:10:44.76
And it's a continuation of that, going in the military.

177
00:10:44.76 --> 00:10:49.40
And so he gets done with business school, and then how do you meet your mom and end up

178
00:10:49.40 --> 00:10:54.40
in out there in Kansas on the 248th to, if a 40 acres of beauty?

179
00:10:54.40 --> 00:10:57.28
Yeah, my, my mother ended up in New York City.

180
00:10:57.28 --> 00:11:02.68
She was a secretary and in the office, there was a woman who introduced, and I, I, I need

181
00:11:02.68 --> 00:11:05.76
to talk to my mother about the specifics of how they got introduced.

182
00:11:05.76 --> 00:11:09.92
But on the first date, she didn't like my father as well as well as, would indicate, even

183
00:11:09.92 --> 00:11:12.08
the fact that later they got married.

184
00:11:12.08 --> 00:11:16.28
But, when I got on another date, I guess, and, and they eventually moved to New Orleans,

185
00:11:16.28 --> 00:11:17.96
they went into the Peace Corps.

186
00:11:17.96 --> 00:11:22.88
We're in Brazil for two years in the 1970s, and then they came back, settled on the farm.

187
00:11:22.88 --> 00:11:25.24
At this point, my grandfather hit, was retiring.

188
00:11:25.24 --> 00:11:26.24
So you're old on.

189
00:11:26.24 --> 00:11:28.40
We got to slow you roll a little bit.

190
00:11:28.40 --> 00:11:34.08
You can't just roll out Marine Corps, NOM, three tours, it's Peace Corps.

191
00:11:34.08 --> 00:11:37.40
That's kind of, that's the freaking dynamic you don't normally say.

192
00:11:37.40 --> 00:11:41.52
Yeah, yeah, I think, in addition to growing up with stories of the Marine Corps, I grew

193
00:11:41.52 --> 00:11:43.40
up with stories of life in Brazil.

194
00:11:43.40 --> 00:11:46.08
And this is in the 1970s and the Amazon Regents.

195
00:11:46.08 --> 00:11:49.16
It was very remote, primitive living.

196
00:11:49.16 --> 00:11:58.08
My mother was teaching, Brazilian kids with special needs, teaching them Portuguese.

197
00:11:58.08 --> 00:12:06.44
And my dad was somewhere in the realm of teaching business and skills to local community

198
00:12:06.44 --> 00:12:07.44
people.

199
00:12:07.44 --> 00:12:08.52
And how long were they down there for?

200
00:12:08.52 --> 00:12:11.40
Two years, two year or two or, and that's in the 70s.

201
00:12:11.40 --> 00:12:15.64
Yeah, what did your dad like start going a little bit hippie?

202
00:12:15.64 --> 00:12:17.44
Was, is that the scenario?

203
00:12:17.44 --> 00:12:21.76
Perhaps, but when I was, my only living memory of him was not as a hippie.

204
00:12:21.76 --> 00:12:26.20
But I think there may have been a stage there in 1970s, post Vietnam.

205
00:12:26.20 --> 00:12:27.20
It can happen.

206
00:12:27.20 --> 00:12:28.20
Uh-huh.

207
00:12:28.20 --> 00:12:29.20
Interesting.

208
00:12:29.20 --> 00:12:32.68
He's gonna be pissed if he just heard me say, he's like, I want to freaking hippie.

209
00:12:32.68 --> 00:12:34.44
I was helping out the locals.

210
00:12:34.44 --> 00:12:35.44
All right.

211
00:12:35.44 --> 00:12:39.88
So then they get married and at what point do they move back to Kansas?

212
00:12:39.88 --> 00:12:44.08
Around the time the Peace Corps tour ended and I think my grandfather was retiring, moving

213
00:12:44.08 --> 00:12:46.56
to the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.

214
00:12:46.56 --> 00:12:50.92
This beautiful property, the home.

215
00:12:50.92 --> 00:12:51.92
It was there.

216
00:12:51.92 --> 00:12:54.96
I think my parents wanted to start a family, what better place?

217
00:12:54.96 --> 00:12:59.76
The land was being farmed by an associate of my fathers, a grandfather's.

218
00:12:59.76 --> 00:13:03.88
And so they settled and I think shortly thereafter had me in 1980.

219
00:13:03.88 --> 00:13:05.64
You're born in 1980?

220
00:13:05.64 --> 00:13:06.64
1980.

221
00:13:06.64 --> 00:13:10.40
And then what's grown up like you're out there on the farm, you're getting trouble for

222
00:13:10.40 --> 00:13:12.72
shooting shit with your BB gun and stuff?

223
00:13:12.72 --> 00:13:14.40
Yeah, we had a section of woods.

224
00:13:14.40 --> 00:13:19.20
We called the Northeast Corner with a creek running through it and I would go and just play

225
00:13:19.20 --> 00:13:21.28
there, try to get lost.

226
00:13:21.28 --> 00:13:22.60
What'd you have for brothers and sisters?

227
00:13:22.60 --> 00:13:23.60
I have a younger sister.

228
00:13:23.60 --> 00:13:25.24
She's seven years my younger sister.

229
00:13:25.24 --> 00:13:26.24
Seven years.

230
00:13:26.24 --> 00:13:33.28
She is a nurse and when we get later into my story, I mean, she quit her job to move

231
00:13:33.28 --> 00:13:35.08
down to DC to take care of me.

232
00:13:35.08 --> 00:13:37.84
Oh, her a lot.

233
00:13:37.84 --> 00:13:39.92
So she's seven years your junior though.

234
00:13:39.92 --> 00:13:42.64
So you were kind of like an only child for a while.

235
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:46.32
For a little while, I learned how to play by myself.

236
00:13:46.32 --> 00:13:47.80
I didn't have close neighbors.

237
00:13:47.80 --> 00:13:51.04
We have neighbors, but not necessarily with kids of my age.

238
00:13:51.04 --> 00:13:53.36
I learned how to entertain myself.

239
00:13:53.36 --> 00:13:55.48
And a lot of this was being outside.

240
00:13:55.48 --> 00:14:00.40
I did like to read as a kid, but in the daytime, I'm outside playing.

241
00:14:00.40 --> 00:14:05.04
We had some dogs, some cats, some pigeons that were in the barn that I was aiming

242
00:14:05.04 --> 00:14:06.04
at.

243
00:14:06.04 --> 00:14:12.88
You know, going on tractor rides, learning how to drive tractors, playing sports, that was

244
00:14:12.88 --> 00:14:13.88
my childhood.

245
00:14:13.88 --> 00:14:15.52
What sports were you playing?

246
00:14:15.52 --> 00:14:19.68
Started baseball, soccer, gravitated toward soccer.

247
00:14:19.68 --> 00:14:22.44
It turns out I'm not that great at team ball sports.

248
00:14:22.44 --> 00:14:28.36
However, the lessons that you can learn from team ball sports really come into play later.

249
00:14:28.36 --> 00:14:32.60
And so I'm very thankful that even though my calling as an athlete was not as a team ball

250
00:14:32.60 --> 00:14:34.16
sport player.

251
00:14:34.16 --> 00:14:35.16
And I was in combat.

252
00:14:35.16 --> 00:14:39.000
I tried wrestling in middle school.

253
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.36
It was just awful.

254
00:14:40.36 --> 00:14:43.88
And then I had this idea of doing boxing.

255
00:14:43.88 --> 00:14:47.52
So it was my sophomore year in high school.

256
00:14:47.52 --> 00:14:53.84
I went to the local Topeka Golden Gloves gym and said, you know, I want to take some lessons.

257
00:14:53.84 --> 00:14:55.84
And so I remember my dad would drive me there and back.

258
00:14:55.84 --> 00:14:57.84
And eventually I started just driving myself.

259
00:14:57.84 --> 00:15:03.80
And I would go and train in the local boxing gym that resulted at one point in going

260
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:06.40
to a competition in Kansas City.

261
00:15:06.40 --> 00:15:11.20
And Kansas City is a big deal when you're from a farm in Kansas.

262
00:15:11.20 --> 00:15:14.84
I went to this tournament in Kansas City.

263
00:15:14.84 --> 00:15:18.20
And I remember there were hundreds of people in the audience.

264
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:23.92
It's kind of an a more underdeveloped area of Kansas City, if you will.

265
00:15:23.92 --> 00:15:31.68
And I remember seeing my opponents older brother was just laying waste to someone on a previous

266
00:15:31.68 --> 00:15:34.28
round.

267
00:15:34.28 --> 00:15:35.44
I was in just so nervous.

268
00:15:35.44 --> 00:15:36.44
I get in the ring.

269
00:15:36.44 --> 00:15:40.32
It was three rounds, very amateur in the first round.

270
00:15:40.32 --> 00:15:42.24
He just laid into me.

271
00:15:42.24 --> 00:15:44.64
And I had the standing eight count against me.

272
00:15:44.64 --> 00:15:47.12
The second round was fairly even in the third round.

273
00:15:47.12 --> 00:15:50.80
I actually gave him the standing eight count.

274
00:15:50.80 --> 00:15:53.56
But it wasn't enough because I just got whipped that first round.

275
00:15:53.56 --> 00:15:54.56
So I lost the fight.

276
00:15:54.56 --> 00:15:55.56
So I lost the fight.

277
00:15:55.56 --> 00:15:57.72
My dad was there watching.

278
00:15:57.72 --> 00:16:02.20
And afterwards we went and had some had a meal, had dinner.

279
00:16:02.20 --> 00:16:03.96
And I just remember him kind of said, it's okay.

280
00:16:03.96 --> 00:16:05.20
He did a good job.

281
00:16:05.20 --> 00:16:09.76
And that was my one and only competitive boxing match.

282
00:16:09.76 --> 00:16:13.16
The thing you've got to remember damn is wrestling.

283
00:16:13.16 --> 00:16:18.24
If you go quote, try wrestling, you're gonna get your ass kicked.

284
00:16:18.24 --> 00:16:25.16
It's not people think wrestling and boxing, they think it's like a primal thing that you're

285
00:16:25.16 --> 00:16:26.16
just going to be able to do.

286
00:16:26.16 --> 00:16:29.28
And there's all kinds of skills and all of the nuts though.

287
00:16:29.28 --> 00:16:36.04
This is I started to think that if all you know is winning, that's just not realistic.

288
00:16:36.04 --> 00:16:39.96
I've spent a lot more time in the not winning realm of winning realm.

289
00:16:39.96 --> 00:16:44.52
And I can tell you that when you're not winning, it forces you to adapt.

290
00:16:44.52 --> 00:16:48.20
It forces you to look at what you're doing, how can you be doing things better?

291
00:16:48.20 --> 00:16:51.52
Force as you to grow, challenges you.

292
00:16:51.52 --> 00:16:55.44
And I think there's a, if sport is just about character development, which I really think

293
00:16:55.44 --> 00:16:59.92
that's what it ultimately is about, then there's a lot to be learned from not winning.

294
00:16:59.92 --> 00:17:05.24
And it's, you need to seek out people who can beat you in order to get better.

295
00:17:05.24 --> 00:17:06.24
Yeah.

296
00:17:06.24 --> 00:17:09.36
So what did you play sports all through high school?

297
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:10.68
I did soccer.

298
00:17:10.68 --> 00:17:13.04
What did you end up accelerating at any of them?

299
00:17:13.04 --> 00:17:16.84
I was a varsity soccer player defender because I didn't have good ball skills.

300
00:17:16.84 --> 00:17:19.12
Even as a freshman, I didn't always start.

301
00:17:19.12 --> 00:17:23.20
I was more of a bench rider, but I did, I wanted to varsity ladder as a freshman.

302
00:17:23.20 --> 00:17:27.92
It started starting as sophomore and then was a varsity player all four years.

303
00:17:27.92 --> 00:17:34.64
My last semester as a senior spring, a new house going to the Naval Academy.

304
00:17:34.64 --> 00:17:36.92
And we can get into the reasons of why I wanted to go there.

305
00:17:36.92 --> 00:17:38.88
But I knew I was going.

306
00:17:38.88 --> 00:17:41.80
And so I decided to join the track team distance running.

307
00:17:41.80 --> 00:17:46.88
I thought I got to show up to the Academy ready to go, ready to bust out of 1.5 mile

308
00:17:46.88 --> 00:17:47.88
run.

309
00:17:47.88 --> 00:17:50.40
Track had a two mile event, a one mile event.

310
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:51.40
So I signed up.

311
00:17:51.40 --> 00:17:54.60
And it turns out in soccer, I was really good at running.

312
00:17:54.60 --> 00:17:57.04
But not so much kicking the ball or passing it.

313
00:17:57.04 --> 00:17:58.04
It's a defender.

314
00:17:58.04 --> 00:18:01.64
I just tried to kick the ball to one of my teammates who could actually do something with it.

315
00:18:01.64 --> 00:18:04.32
But in track, I was pretty good for one season track athlete.

316
00:18:04.32 --> 00:18:06.72
I ended up running a sub five minute mile.

317
00:18:06.72 --> 00:18:10.08
I had a, I don't know, a 1032 mile.

318
00:18:10.08 --> 00:18:12.76
And so I thought, endurance sports could, could have been my thing.

319
00:18:12.76 --> 00:18:14.20
I just wasn't exposed to it earlier.

320
00:18:14.20 --> 00:18:18.60
I certainly wasn't exposed to cross country skiing as a kid from a farm in Kansas.

321
00:18:18.60 --> 00:18:20.92
So you end up going to the Naval Academy.

322
00:18:20.92 --> 00:18:23.44
How did you get interested in going to the Naval Academy?

323
00:18:23.44 --> 00:18:28.72
I don't want to say that my father pushed me in that direction in no way whatsoever.

324
00:18:28.72 --> 00:18:32.44
I found out he wrote me a letter when I did get into the Naval Academy and he said that

325
00:18:32.44 --> 00:18:36.68
his childhood dream was to go to the Naval Academy, but he didn't have the grades and

326
00:18:36.68 --> 00:18:39.44
didn't even apply.

327
00:18:39.44 --> 00:18:44.52
But I didn't, I didn't choose to go to the military in the sense of it feeling like a

328
00:18:44.52 --> 00:18:45.52
decision.

329
00:18:45.52 --> 00:18:48.32
It just felt like this is what I'm supposed to do.

330
00:18:48.32 --> 00:18:49.32
It really did.

331
00:18:49.32 --> 00:18:50.32
I wanted to be a Marine.

332
00:18:50.32 --> 00:18:51.72
Did you apply to a West Point, too?

333
00:18:51.72 --> 00:18:52.72
I did.

334
00:18:52.72 --> 00:18:53.72
That was my Academy.

335
00:18:53.72 --> 00:18:54.72
West Point was my backup plan.

336
00:18:54.72 --> 00:18:55.72
Oh, my god.

337
00:18:55.72 --> 00:18:58.24
I got into the best one, the Naval Academy.

338
00:18:58.24 --> 00:19:03.28
So I, I just wanted to combine military service with continuing my education and I felt

339
00:19:03.28 --> 00:19:10.12
like as an officer, I would have leadership responsibilities and this would be, I had

340
00:19:10.12 --> 00:19:11.12
red books.

341
00:19:11.12 --> 00:19:13.28
Vietnam still fascinates me.

342
00:19:13.28 --> 00:19:17.32
And probably a large part of this is due to my father having been in the Vietnam

343
00:19:17.32 --> 00:19:21.32
war.

344
00:19:21.32 --> 00:19:23.40
But I would read anything I could get my hands on about special operations in Vietnam, infantry

345
00:19:23.40 --> 00:19:25.60
platoons, Marine Corps.

346
00:19:25.60 --> 00:19:31.000
It was very, very much keen on infantry, small unit tactics.

347
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.08
I ended up signing up for the local US Naval Secrets program.

348
00:19:36.08 --> 00:19:38.68
There was a Naval Reserve unit into Pika Kansas.

349
00:19:38.68 --> 00:19:42.48
We drive there and it was kind of modeled after reserves in one week in the month you show

350
00:19:42.48 --> 00:19:47.28
up and you drill the summers between your academic years of high school.

351
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:48.28
You get Navy training.

352
00:19:48.28 --> 00:19:50.28
It starts with boot camp in Great Lakes.

353
00:19:50.28 --> 00:19:54.56
So I went to Great Lakes.

354
00:19:54.56 --> 00:19:56.96
The summer before my junior year of high school.

355
00:19:56.96 --> 00:19:57.96
How old were you?

356
00:19:57.96 --> 00:20:01.60
I was 15, 15, 16, yeah, two weeks.

357
00:20:01.60 --> 00:20:05.76
Not an actual boot camp, but it's very much your in Great Lakes, your wearing Dunga

358
00:20:05.76 --> 00:20:08.04
Rees, your marching around, you're getting yelled at.

359
00:20:08.04 --> 00:20:10.04
I'm just in high school.

360
00:20:10.04 --> 00:20:12.72
Don't remember ever signing a waiver.

361
00:20:12.72 --> 00:20:15.60
But they had this training called seal training.

362
00:20:15.60 --> 00:20:18.20
I had to do one other training before that.

363
00:20:18.20 --> 00:20:23.92
So after that summer of going to Great Lakes for boot camp, I went to amphibious school in

364
00:20:23.92 --> 00:20:24.92
Virginia.

365
00:20:24.92 --> 00:20:27.04
Again, I'm 15 or 16.

366
00:20:27.04 --> 00:20:30.36
Because I had to knock out one of these before I could be eligible for seal training

367
00:20:30.36 --> 00:20:31.36
it out.

368
00:20:31.36 --> 00:20:34.32
In order to go to this seal camp, which is going to be the following year that I would be eligible

369
00:20:34.32 --> 00:20:36.48
the summer before my senior year.

370
00:20:36.48 --> 00:20:40.52
I have to take the the the bud's physical fitness test.

371
00:20:40.52 --> 00:20:45.52
I have to go to the center yard side stroke and push ups pull ups sit ups and 1.5 mile

372
00:20:45.52 --> 00:20:46.52
run.

373
00:20:46.52 --> 00:20:49.52
So I started training for it and I was horrible, horrible at swimming, just horrible.

374
00:20:49.52 --> 00:20:54.52
But I somehow got under the 12 minute time or whatever it had cut up barely.

375
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:59.56
And so they put me out to Virginia Beach, little creek for this two week camp and it

376
00:20:59.56 --> 00:21:01.68
starts with what year is this?

377
00:21:01.68 --> 00:21:04.28
This would have been 97, 1997.

378
00:21:04.28 --> 00:21:10.08
So this is actually run by active duty team guys, putting these high school kids

379
00:21:10.08 --> 00:21:14.60
through this wash down version of hell week.

380
00:21:14.60 --> 00:21:20.88
We had a hell night and started off and I remember that was a continuous, there's a 24

381
00:21:20.88 --> 00:21:24.36
hour thing started sometime in the day and sometime the next day.

382
00:21:24.36 --> 00:21:29.64
Go through the night running with boats on your head and I remember at one point running

383
00:21:29.64 --> 00:21:30.64
with a boat on my head.

384
00:21:30.64 --> 00:21:36.84
I was on the left side of the boat and an active duty Navy seal is just yelling at me.

385
00:21:36.84 --> 00:21:39.12
Because I remember who it was, but I don't.

386
00:21:39.12 --> 00:21:43.76
I remember there was a chief black burn in the, the particular individual in this story

387
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:46.68
is not chief black burn.

388
00:21:46.68 --> 00:21:51.60
I was slacking off and he just laid in the me about how I wasn't being a good teammate

389
00:21:51.60 --> 00:21:53.20
and I'll never forget that.

390
00:21:53.20 --> 00:22:00.32
It just cut right into me and I came back after that we got to shoot MP5s, we got to do

391
00:22:00.32 --> 00:22:02.68
the water obstacle course in Virginia Beach.

392
00:22:02.68 --> 00:22:03.92
It's just as a high school kid.

393
00:22:03.92 --> 00:22:05.28
I mean this is amazing.

394
00:22:05.28 --> 00:22:11.68
But truth be told, I didn't have perfect eyesight and I just was horrible in the water.

395
00:22:11.68 --> 00:22:19.60
So when I did get into the Naval Academy, my preference was for the Marine Corps.

396
00:22:19.60 --> 00:22:26.72
So all that who ya'll seal stuff did get you like totally brain washed.

397
00:22:26.72 --> 00:22:29.76
I was brain washed just sitting over here listening to you tell that if I would have been

398
00:22:29.76 --> 00:22:32.40
15 would have been a done deal.

399
00:22:32.40 --> 00:22:34.72
It was, but I just didn't think.

400
00:22:34.72 --> 00:22:35.72
How bad was your eyesight?

401
00:22:35.72 --> 00:22:36.72
Chance.

402
00:22:36.72 --> 00:22:37.72
It needed to be correct.

403
00:22:37.72 --> 00:22:41.80
It wasn't within 2040, it wasn't certainly wasn't 2020.

404
00:22:41.80 --> 00:22:43.96
At this point I didn't know about corrective surgery.

405
00:22:43.96 --> 00:22:46.000
I didn't need that wasn't even a thing.

406
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.40
I had the Naval Academy.

407
00:22:47.40 --> 00:22:53.44
I thought I can go in the Marine Corps infantry be a platoon leader or a company commander

408
00:22:53.44 --> 00:22:55.000
and so that's what I was leaning towards.

409
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.84
I mean absolutely though when I went to the Naval Academy, the seal program was extremely

410
00:23:00.84 --> 00:23:01.84
intriguing to me.

411
00:23:01.84 --> 00:23:06.08
I just didn't think I would be eligible, why would you set yourself up just to be disappointed

412
00:23:06.08 --> 00:23:07.40
to check?

413
00:23:07.40 --> 00:23:10.48
So anything else from high school before you roll out?

414
00:23:10.48 --> 00:23:15.76
How are was it to get like all the congressional recommendation and all that stuff?

415
00:23:15.76 --> 00:23:18.88
You know I don't think it's that hard when you're applying to the Naval Academy from Kansas.

416
00:23:18.88 --> 00:23:24.64
Now it may be different now, but if I was applying in Virginia or California or Texas,

417
00:23:24.64 --> 00:23:30.72
Maryland, Virginia, the geographically proximate states, they're very competitive.

418
00:23:30.72 --> 00:23:35.12
What I had good grades, you know one thing I should say is by the time I was a freshman

419
00:23:35.12 --> 00:23:39.88
in high school, I was fortunate enough to have this goal of the Naval Academy inside me.

420
00:23:39.88 --> 00:23:43.28
I don't know how it got there, but it was there.

421
00:23:43.28 --> 00:23:47.44
And so it then becomes a matter of, well what do I need to do to get into this place?

422
00:23:47.44 --> 00:23:49.20
It's going to be really hard.

423
00:23:49.20 --> 00:23:54.20
Okay you got to have good grades check, I'll study and get good grades.

424
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:57.40
You got to demonstrate some athletic talent.

425
00:23:57.40 --> 00:23:58.92
Okay well I'm already doing that.

426
00:23:58.92 --> 00:24:01.60
It's just that was easy for me.

427
00:24:01.60 --> 00:24:04.44
Leadership, okay well I'll try to be a sports team captain.

428
00:24:04.44 --> 00:24:06.08
I'll try to run for student government.

429
00:24:06.08 --> 00:24:08.76
I'll do the secrets.

430
00:24:08.76 --> 00:24:10.72
And that's kind of how I structured it.

431
00:24:10.72 --> 00:24:16.52
And so I think as my story unfolds, you'll see I tend to be a fairly goal oriented person,

432
00:24:16.52 --> 00:24:22.92
but this is something I think is very, it's very important but not to force the goals.

433
00:24:22.92 --> 00:24:30.24
But when I have these goals naturally, I feel like I can just be ignited because this is

434
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:31.56
driving me forward.

435
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:33.68
And that's what was happening as early as my freshman year.

436
00:24:33.68 --> 00:24:35.20
And that's why I think I'm very fortunate.

437
00:24:35.20 --> 00:24:38.52
Because if you make this decision, you want to go to a service academy in your senior

438
00:24:38.52 --> 00:24:40.08
year of high school, it's too late.

439
00:24:40.08 --> 00:24:42.08
You got to start the process in your junior year.

440
00:24:42.08 --> 00:24:48.28
You do have to get a nomination from either senator in your state or from your congressional

441
00:24:48.28 --> 00:24:49.68
representative.

442
00:24:49.68 --> 00:24:53.32
And they're in court, they're in communication with the academies and I think the academies

443
00:24:53.32 --> 00:24:58.52
kind of lean them towards the candidates that they are already identifying.

444
00:24:58.52 --> 00:25:03.60
And you have no, what did you hear about the Naval Academy for the first time you don't remember?

445
00:25:03.60 --> 00:25:05.08
Had to have been in a book.

446
00:25:05.08 --> 00:25:09.000
I mean I would just, I remember watching movies like Predator.

447
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.80
Just, I'll come echo didn't end up with the Naval Academy.

448
00:25:13.80 --> 00:25:16.04
He just wants to spread it a lot more humor.

449
00:25:16.04 --> 00:25:22.08
Yeah, probably was reading some books on a platoon leader in the Marine Corps in Vietnam or

450
00:25:22.08 --> 00:25:23.28
something Naval Academy.

451
00:25:23.28 --> 00:25:28.04
I think how it actually happened was at one point I wanted to be a pilot, but then the

452
00:25:28.04 --> 00:25:32.88
eyesight thing, it's just, it's not happening, but to be a pilot, I mean, you start getting

453
00:25:32.88 --> 00:25:37.28
aware of the service academy because to be a pilot, you have to go to a commissioning

454
00:25:37.28 --> 00:25:38.28
source.

455
00:25:38.28 --> 00:25:39.28
Yeah.

456
00:25:39.28 --> 00:25:44.56
So when you show up at the Naval Academy for like plebesummer, you must be pretty

457
00:25:44.56 --> 00:25:49.12
used to this kind of crap because you've already been to boot camp.

458
00:25:49.12 --> 00:25:54.48
You've been head of a team as a legitimate beach for freaking crushing you.

459
00:25:54.48 --> 00:25:57.52
It really was not that big of a deal.

460
00:25:57.52 --> 00:26:01.04
And plebesummer is this six week indoctrination.

461
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:07.16
It is not boot camp, but it is a service academy equivalent of boot camp.

462
00:26:07.16 --> 00:26:14.92
You're a class of about 1200 incoming freshman report in the middle of the summer, July

463
00:26:14.92 --> 00:26:22.92
for about a six week indoctrination into the military that occurs and ends before the academic

464
00:26:22.92 --> 00:26:23.92
year.

465
00:26:23.92 --> 00:26:27.68
On the note of the secret, I will say that at the end of my plebe, you're a freshman

466
00:26:27.68 --> 00:26:31.80
year at the Naval Academy, I was invited back to be the class leader.

467
00:26:31.80 --> 00:26:35.68
I did do that and that was just an awesome leadership opportunity.

468
00:26:35.68 --> 00:26:42.44
I could be the class leader of what of the incoming secret class of high school students.

469
00:26:42.44 --> 00:26:50.84
So as a now done with my plebe year at the Naval Academy, I'm the class OIC of this

470
00:26:50.84 --> 00:26:55.32
group of high school kids coming from all over the place, running through the same thing

471
00:26:55.32 --> 00:27:02.32
I had been through two years before at this point because the other summer was plebesummer.

472
00:27:02.32 --> 00:27:06.76
And how did you like the Naval Academy?

473
00:27:06.76 --> 00:27:10.76
Well, I like a love-hate relationship, right?

474
00:27:10.76 --> 00:27:17.76
Yeah, there's the saying, I hate this place.

475
00:27:17.76 --> 00:27:26.000
But in high school, I have friends, but I didn't have what I would call deep connections

476
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.08
with the people that I was going to high school with.

477
00:27:29.08 --> 00:27:34.68
And I definitely had friends, but when I was in the Naval Academy for the first time,

478
00:27:34.68 --> 00:27:39.16
I'm finding people that I really see I to I with.

479
00:27:39.16 --> 00:27:45.20
I mean, really quite bonded in this way of looking at the world the same way.

480
00:27:45.20 --> 00:27:50.24
Like, just common interest, common personality, this kind of thing.

481
00:27:50.24 --> 00:27:54.80
But to a person, and we found each other, weren't in the same companies.

482
00:27:54.80 --> 00:27:56.96
They all wanted to be selected for seal training.

483
00:27:56.96 --> 00:27:57.96
All of them.

484
00:27:57.96 --> 00:28:03.68
Telling me, a couple of these individuals were recruited swimmers all American high school

485
00:28:03.68 --> 00:28:04.68
swimmers.

486
00:28:04.68 --> 00:28:09.32
Another varsity swimmers is freshman at the Naval Academy.

487
00:28:09.32 --> 00:28:14.80
One, actually two were really good boxers and found that out the hard way trying to

488
00:28:14.80 --> 00:28:16.28
spar with them a little bit in the ring.

489
00:28:16.28 --> 00:28:22.48
And then, you know, there was me farm kid from Kansas and, you know, I just was not comfortable

490
00:28:22.48 --> 00:28:24.20
in the water.

491
00:28:24.20 --> 00:28:31.24
The truth of it is, in pleapsummer, I excelled physically and anything that was on land.

492
00:28:31.24 --> 00:28:35.36
But any time we had to do something in the water and this is maybe two times a week,

493
00:28:35.36 --> 00:28:41.92
you have to demonstrate to the Navy that you can float that you can take off your camis,

494
00:28:41.92 --> 00:28:47.56
camouflage uniform when you're floating, and tie them and inflate them to help you float.

495
00:28:47.56 --> 00:28:51.84
You have to demonstrate that in the event that you fall off a ship that you're not a total

496
00:28:51.84 --> 00:28:55.76
liability that you can swim from one side of the pool to the other.

497
00:28:55.76 --> 00:28:58.20
This is what you're doing in pleapsummer.

498
00:28:58.20 --> 00:29:01.60
And on those particular days, we're marching, it's hot out.

499
00:29:01.60 --> 00:29:05.84
I would have knots of anxiety in my stomach.

500
00:29:05.84 --> 00:29:07.84
Pouple.

501
00:29:07.84 --> 00:29:11.56
Who's scared of failing or you scared of drowning?

502
00:29:11.56 --> 00:29:12.56
I was scared of the water.

503
00:29:12.56 --> 00:29:13.88
I just didn't have a lot of expo.

504
00:29:13.88 --> 00:29:18.12
Now, granted, I've gone to the seal, seek it at seal thing, but there wasn't, there was

505
00:29:18.12 --> 00:29:20.96
a little bit in the water and that stuff petrified me.

506
00:29:20.96 --> 00:29:26.44
So I mean, you know, and it given what I ended up doing, one could call in the question

507
00:29:26.44 --> 00:29:31.32
my career decision making skills, given that this reality when I went to the Navy,

508
00:29:31.32 --> 00:29:34.68
I was just very, very scared of the water.

509
00:29:34.68 --> 00:29:37.44
But by the end of this first year, I had met my circle of friends.

510
00:29:37.44 --> 00:29:40.68
They all wanted to pretty much do a person wanted to be selected for seal training.

511
00:29:40.68 --> 00:29:46.56
And so, these guys all in your same class, same class, so we're pleaps, freshman.

512
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:48.72
And they're just down for the seals.

513
00:29:48.72 --> 00:29:49.72
Yeah.

514
00:29:49.72 --> 00:29:54.20
How long did it take for you to start thinking that in that direction as well?

515
00:29:54.20 --> 00:29:58.80
I would say by the end of my first year there, I know not only I wanted to be a Marine,

516
00:29:58.80 --> 00:30:01.96
and I wanted to be selected for seal program, but I knew that I needed to get in the water.

517
00:30:01.96 --> 00:30:02.84
It started training.

518
00:30:02.84 --> 00:30:03.64
Get parents.

519
00:30:03.64 --> 00:30:04.44
What about your eyesight?

520
00:30:04.44 --> 00:30:06.84
Had you now learned that you could get a corrective surgery?

521
00:30:06.84 --> 00:30:11.88
That year's class, 1999, was able to get PRK.

522
00:30:11.88 --> 00:30:13.44
So that was a game changer for me.

523
00:30:13.44 --> 00:30:16.12
And then it's like, okay, well.

524
00:30:16.12 --> 00:30:19.04
So you weren't the class of 1999?

525
00:30:19.04 --> 00:30:21.88
No, I was class of 2002, so that in the...

526
00:30:21.88 --> 00:30:25.32
So you watched the guys that were going to graduate 1999?

527
00:30:25.32 --> 00:30:27.56
Or that had graduated 1999?

528
00:30:27.56 --> 00:30:28.60
Yes, and they were going to go through a bunch of...

529
00:30:28.60 --> 00:30:34.80
They were going to buds, and for those listening, there are at the time 16 billets

530
00:30:34.80 --> 00:30:41.24
from the Naval Academy, graduating class to go to buds, seal training, and those

531
00:30:41.24 --> 00:30:47.08
those billets are split over multiple classes, but 16, graduate and get to go to buds.

532
00:30:47.08 --> 00:30:51.64
And that service selection happens around January of your senior year.

533
00:30:51.64 --> 00:30:56.12
So as a freshman in January, I'm seeing who gets picked.

534
00:30:56.12 --> 00:31:00.20
And I had just heard that some of these individuals had PRK to correct their vision.

535
00:31:00.20 --> 00:31:06.20
So that they may have had that done a year before or something, but this is a game changer

536
00:31:06.20 --> 00:31:07.20
for me.

537
00:31:07.20 --> 00:31:12.04
I just need to get better in the water, because I was awful.

538
00:31:12.04 --> 00:31:17.72
In addition to being scared of the water, borderline scared just could not swim.

539
00:31:17.72 --> 00:31:21.92
So do you start spending extra time in a pool, do someone grab you and coach you and

540
00:31:21.92 --> 00:31:24.20
mentor you, like how do you start getting through this?

541
00:31:24.20 --> 00:31:28.92
Well, I had a good buddy who became a team guy, and we just started training together.

542
00:31:28.92 --> 00:31:31.92
And yeah, I would figure it out myself.

543
00:31:31.92 --> 00:31:32.92
We work on job proof.

544
00:31:32.92 --> 00:31:37.24
We would work on swimming underwater, 25 meters, something like that.

545
00:31:37.24 --> 00:31:39.16
Working on the stroke, working.

546
00:31:39.16 --> 00:31:44.40
I also had this goal of trying to make the triathlon team, because that year, the senior

547
00:31:44.40 --> 00:31:51.20
class, out of those 16 bullets going to buds, I want to say five came from the triathlon team.

548
00:31:51.20 --> 00:31:53.96
Well, that's a team that could be good to make.

549
00:31:53.96 --> 00:31:58.68
It's not a varsity sport, so you don't have to be recruited to club sport.

550
00:31:58.68 --> 00:32:00.12
Let's get in the water and start training.

551
00:32:00.12 --> 00:32:02.36
That was a very good runner and good at cycling.

552
00:32:02.36 --> 00:32:04.24
So I thought I'll train for triathlon.

553
00:32:04.24 --> 00:32:07.20
And along with my friend, we started training.

554
00:32:07.20 --> 00:32:12.88
We would just go on these adventures, running or cycling with our fins strapped to a backpack

555
00:32:12.88 --> 00:32:18.88
out to Bay Ridge or into the Chesapeake and just then go fins swim and cold water, come

556
00:32:18.88 --> 00:32:23.68
back, get on the bike or run back to the academy.

557
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:27.48
Just doing fun adventures like that, and it just started pushing my limits.

558
00:32:27.48 --> 00:32:28.48
What were you majoring?

559
00:32:28.48 --> 00:32:29.48
What'd you major in?

560
00:32:29.48 --> 00:32:30.64
I chose the major in English.

561
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:33.68
The service academies are geared towards science and engineering.

562
00:32:33.68 --> 00:32:40.68
And they said, pleb your chemistry is a good identifier of whether you will do well in

563
00:32:40.68 --> 00:32:43.92
engineering and science if you want to major.

564
00:32:43.92 --> 00:32:47.96
And they call it group one and then group three is more of the humanities.

565
00:32:47.96 --> 00:32:50.40
At first semester chemistry, no problem.

566
00:32:50.40 --> 00:32:53.12
It was a repeat of my high school.

567
00:32:53.12 --> 00:32:56.24
But second semester chemistry was new stuff.

568
00:32:56.24 --> 00:32:57.80
It just was over my head.

569
00:32:57.80 --> 00:33:03.60
And so I thought I had a very influential English teacher in high school, Mr. Schulz.

570
00:33:03.60 --> 00:33:09.08
And in addition to my parents, really exposing me to reading and just I love, I still love

571
00:33:09.08 --> 00:33:12.80
to read a lot.

572
00:33:12.80 --> 00:33:16.44
This teacher really inspired me to want to be an English mate.

573
00:33:16.44 --> 00:33:19.56
If this is what you like to do, do it.

574
00:33:19.56 --> 00:33:20.88
And there's benefit from this.

575
00:33:20.88 --> 00:33:27.80
I thought you learn about people, you learn about situations, you develop inability to empathize

576
00:33:27.80 --> 00:33:31.000
or hopefully with other people.

577
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.52
And communication skills as well.

578
00:33:32.52 --> 00:33:34.32
This is all very important in the military.

579
00:33:34.32 --> 00:33:38.20
So you decide that you're going to study English while you're at the Naval Academy.

580
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:39.20
Correct.

581
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:41.76
And are they what part of English are you studying?

582
00:33:41.76 --> 00:33:44.36
Like a mean that just seems kind of strange.

583
00:33:44.36 --> 00:33:45.52
It's English lit.

584
00:33:45.52 --> 00:33:47.16
It just was cold English.

585
00:33:47.16 --> 00:33:49.16
But really it's not.

586
00:33:49.16 --> 00:33:51.16
I mean, I think they had some writing classes.

587
00:33:51.16 --> 00:33:52.16
They're creative writing.

588
00:33:52.16 --> 00:33:53.16
This kind of thing.

589
00:33:53.16 --> 00:33:55.64
But really it's the study of literature.

590
00:33:55.64 --> 00:33:58.80
And my favorite class was a class on the Hemingway.

591
00:33:58.80 --> 00:34:03.68
And as a kid, I read Hemingway and I read a fair world of arms for whom the belt

592
00:34:03.68 --> 00:34:04.68
tools.

593
00:34:04.68 --> 00:34:10.64
And these are books very much about war and the wartime experience.

594
00:34:10.64 --> 00:34:16.28
So as you're going through at what point are you start to compete and you're starting

595
00:34:16.28 --> 00:34:19.04
to look at how I actually going to get selected?

596
00:34:19.04 --> 00:34:21.76
Because you know, you say there's 16 bullets.

597
00:34:21.76 --> 00:34:27.000
And that is as competitive as it gets to get one of those 16 bullets.

598
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.32
What do you think you did that was able to make you stand out and actually get selected?

599
00:34:31.32 --> 00:34:32.92
I remember plebier.

600
00:34:32.92 --> 00:34:33.92
We were in an auditorium.

601
00:34:33.92 --> 00:34:37.52
I think this is during pleb summer when the whole class of 1200 people was assembled.

602
00:34:37.52 --> 00:34:41.24
And they're saying who wants to be an aviator 600 hands go up?

603
00:34:41.24 --> 00:34:43.52
Who wants to be on a 600 out of roughly 12.

604
00:34:43.52 --> 00:34:44.52
1200.

605
00:34:44.52 --> 00:34:46.72
I'm estimating who wants to be on a ship.

606
00:34:46.72 --> 00:34:52.12
And you know, a few hundred who wants to be an avi seal and like 250 hands go up.

607
00:34:52.12 --> 00:34:53.44
Easy.

608
00:34:53.44 --> 00:34:56.52
But by the time it comes around to the junior year, we really got to start making things

609
00:34:56.52 --> 00:34:58.16
happen.

610
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:02.72
I feel like there were maybe 60 or 70 in my class that were kind of very much gutting for

611
00:35:02.72 --> 00:35:03.72
this.

612
00:35:03.72 --> 00:35:07.20
You have to do a screener weekend in order to get ready for mini buds.

613
00:35:07.20 --> 00:35:13.72
Mini buds is a three week program prior to your senior academic year.

614
00:35:13.72 --> 00:35:15.56
So you'd go there to Coronado.

615
00:35:15.56 --> 00:35:16.56
Did you go to mini buds?

616
00:35:16.56 --> 00:35:17.56
I did.

617
00:35:17.56 --> 00:35:20.72
I had to do the screener weekend in the fall in my junior year.

618
00:35:20.72 --> 00:35:26.12
And in that year ranked based on a PFT physical fitness test, you go through

619
00:35:26.12 --> 00:35:32.60
about two days of just hazing essentially from the seniors, upper class who have gone to

620
00:35:32.60 --> 00:35:34.60
mini buds if that really called.

621
00:35:34.60 --> 00:35:36.40
Is that to do the band?

622
00:35:36.40 --> 00:35:37.60
And then from that if you survive.

623
00:35:37.60 --> 00:35:38.60
That is.

624
00:35:38.60 --> 00:35:41.68
Most badass to start with even a mini buds.

625
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:44.000
When at the time, you know, you're revering.

626
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.16
They've been to mini buds and some of them are going to go to buds.

627
00:35:47.16 --> 00:35:52.24
And if you get through all this, then you can go to mini buds and then ostensibly you're

628
00:35:52.24 --> 00:35:53.24
ranked out of that.

629
00:35:53.24 --> 00:35:57.64
And then it goes into your senior year, you do another fitness test like it's ranked.

630
00:35:57.64 --> 00:35:59.16
You do a peer evaluation.

631
00:35:59.16 --> 00:36:00.96
Who do you want to go to buds with?

632
00:36:00.96 --> 00:36:01.96
Who do you not want to go to buds with?

633
00:36:01.96 --> 00:36:04.44
So you've got selected to go to mini buds.

634
00:36:04.44 --> 00:36:05.44
I did.

635
00:36:05.44 --> 00:36:06.44
Yep.

636
00:36:06.44 --> 00:36:08.48
And how was mini buds?

637
00:36:08.48 --> 00:36:09.48
Yep.

638
00:36:09.48 --> 00:36:10.48
I thought I did well.

639
00:36:10.48 --> 00:36:11.48
It's three weeks long.

640
00:36:11.48 --> 00:36:12.48
Yeah.

641
00:36:12.48 --> 00:36:14.20
This is my first time going to Coronado, California.

642
00:36:14.20 --> 00:36:16.84
And I fell in love with the place being from Kansas.

643
00:36:16.84 --> 00:36:18.36
I was like this.

644
00:36:18.36 --> 00:36:19.36
This is awesome.

645
00:36:19.36 --> 00:36:20.80
We had the weekends off.

646
00:36:20.80 --> 00:36:22.52
I think we did a Hell Knight.

647
00:36:22.52 --> 00:36:26.56
Similar to the Secret Act thing I did, except now it's in Coronado as opposed to Little

648
00:36:26.56 --> 00:36:28.36
Creek Virginia.

649
00:36:28.36 --> 00:36:29.76
And then it was just exposure.

650
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:33.40
In high school, I'd been shooting MPF, they let us shoot MPF5s.

651
00:36:33.40 --> 00:36:36.76
And I don't think we even did got to do anything that cool in mini buds.

652
00:36:36.76 --> 00:36:40.98
I think some of it was just going out to La Posta and doing some land navigation in the

653
00:36:40.98 --> 00:36:42.32
heat.

654
00:36:42.32 --> 00:36:46.04
But it was just a really good time with my buddies from the Naval Academy.

655
00:36:46.04 --> 00:36:49.04
And then after that, I got to go to Navy Dive School because I had done a screener for

656
00:36:49.04 --> 00:36:50.04
that.

657
00:36:50.04 --> 00:36:51.04
And that's in Panama City Florida.

658
00:36:51.04 --> 00:36:56.72
I think that really was helpful for me, given my insecurities in the water to go to

659
00:36:56.72 --> 00:37:03.56
Dive School five weeks in Panama City Florida, learning how to dive 28.

660
00:37:03.56 --> 00:37:04.92
How long was it five weeks?

661
00:37:04.92 --> 00:37:05.92
It was five weeks.

662
00:37:05.92 --> 00:37:07.64
So that's summer before my senior year.

663
00:37:07.64 --> 00:37:10.28
It was just for me, it was just the best summer.

664
00:37:10.28 --> 00:37:15.44
Many buds for three weeks, Dive School for five weeks come back senior year with a dive

665
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:20.68
bubble, not that's, I mean, just in the school, that's kind of a big deal to have a dive

666
00:37:20.68 --> 00:37:21.68
bubble.

667
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:27.000
You were kind of a bad ass.

668
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.68
And you get done with all that.

669
00:37:28.68 --> 00:37:32.16
And now this is like September 2001, right?

670
00:37:32.16 --> 00:37:36.64
This is like September 11, 2001, it's going to go down right before or as you start your

671
00:37:36.64 --> 00:37:37.64
senior year.

672
00:37:37.64 --> 00:37:40.36
Yeah, I remember September, I'll never forget that day.

673
00:37:40.36 --> 00:37:43.88
I had a late morning class.

674
00:37:43.88 --> 00:37:49.60
And I went out for a run that morning and out outside of the campus, outside of the

675
00:37:49.60 --> 00:37:51.20
yard.

676
00:37:51.20 --> 00:37:57.16
And as a senior year allowed to do that, I came back to the gate and they wouldn't let

677
00:37:57.16 --> 00:37:58.16
me in.

678
00:37:58.16 --> 00:37:59.48
I didn't have my ID.

679
00:37:59.48 --> 00:38:01.28
You don't need to run with an ID.

680
00:38:01.28 --> 00:38:03.56
Why are they asking for my ID?

681
00:38:03.56 --> 00:38:05.56
And then I came to find out what had happened.

682
00:38:05.56 --> 00:38:10.48
I went back to the dorm where we all live, I changed into my uniform with the class and

683
00:38:10.48 --> 00:38:14.12
you're seeing the replays I didn't see it live.

684
00:38:14.12 --> 00:38:19.28
But things totally, totally changed.

685
00:38:19.28 --> 00:38:22.60
I mean, that day, the academy was on lockdown.

686
00:38:22.60 --> 00:38:23.92
We didn't know what was happening.

687
00:38:23.92 --> 00:38:26.60
We had heard the Pentagon have been attacked.

688
00:38:26.60 --> 00:38:28.56
Of course, the towers in New York.

689
00:38:28.56 --> 00:38:37.88
And for me, this some really drove home, this reality, if I get selected for seal training.

690
00:38:37.88 --> 00:38:44.88
And I'm not going to know until January, I'm going to be directly involved in the nations

691
00:38:44.88 --> 00:38:46.48
response to this.

692
00:38:46.48 --> 00:38:47.48
This is for real.

693
00:38:47.48 --> 00:38:49.92
Now we're at war.

694
00:38:49.92 --> 00:38:54.28
And there's a decision that anybody wanted to go to Buds has to make.

695
00:38:54.28 --> 00:39:00.04
It's the decision of what are you going to put in your second choice.

696
00:39:00.04 --> 00:39:04.76
And the theory amongst the majority of my friends, in fact, I think all of them was, well,

697
00:39:04.76 --> 00:39:09.24
if you want to demonstrate that you want to be a seal, you need to put ships as number

698
00:39:09.24 --> 00:39:13.24
two, because that's the best way to laterally transfer.

699
00:39:13.24 --> 00:39:16.24
You're going to have to go to Newport, Rhode Island for a surface war for our officer

700
00:39:16.24 --> 00:39:17.24
school.

701
00:39:17.24 --> 00:39:18.68
You'll do a tour in the fleet.

702
00:39:18.68 --> 00:39:22.56
And then you can put in your packaging and come to Buds two years later.

703
00:39:22.56 --> 00:39:25.48
For me, I was thinking about this long and hard.

704
00:39:25.48 --> 00:39:27.12
You're just trying to game.

705
00:39:27.12 --> 00:39:29.92
You want to get one of those billets, but you don't know if you will.

706
00:39:29.92 --> 00:39:30.92
It's very competitive.

707
00:39:30.92 --> 00:39:33.84
At this point, there's probably 45 guys that are up for this.

708
00:39:33.84 --> 00:39:37.000
And these guys are like varsity wrestlers, varsity swimmers.

709
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Yeah.

710
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.88
Water pull-ups, water pull-ups, badasses.

711
00:39:39.88 --> 00:39:40.88
Yeah.

712
00:39:40.88 --> 00:39:41.88
Destroying the PST.

713
00:39:41.88 --> 00:39:44.56
They got a 4.0 GPA.

714
00:39:44.56 --> 00:39:46.20
It's like just studs.

715
00:39:46.20 --> 00:39:47.20
Yeah.

716
00:39:47.20 --> 00:39:51.80
So for me, I thought about this and I put the Marine Corps as number two.

717
00:39:51.80 --> 00:39:53.88
You have to go into an interview board.

718
00:39:53.88 --> 00:39:55.20
And this happens in the fall.

719
00:39:55.20 --> 00:39:58.84
And this board was happening after 9-11.

720
00:39:58.84 --> 00:40:06.88
And it's comprised of senior seal officers, mid-middle range seal officers.

721
00:40:06.88 --> 00:40:11.12
There's a couple of Lieutenant's at the Academy of the Time and then senior enlisted seals.

722
00:40:11.12 --> 00:40:12.72
So this isn't timid any.

723
00:40:12.72 --> 00:40:18.52
It's panel maybe eight to ten team guy officers and enlisted that you know, you just,

724
00:40:18.52 --> 00:40:20.92
you don't see a lot of tried-inset the Academy.

725
00:40:20.92 --> 00:40:23.36
So when you do, it's just intimidating.

726
00:40:23.36 --> 00:40:28.48
Dude, I, when I went to boot camp, there was blood and seal there.

727
00:40:28.48 --> 00:40:34.24
And like, I saw him years later, like probably two or three years later.

728
00:40:34.24 --> 00:40:36.84
He, he had gotten out and was going, coming back in.

729
00:40:36.84 --> 00:40:42.40
And so he was at boot camp, like going through some basic like wickets to get

730
00:40:42.40 --> 00:40:45.40
reinstated in the Navy and he had a try to, and you know,

731
00:40:45.40 --> 00:40:48.24
I was like, oh my god, it's a freaking real seal.

732
00:40:48.24 --> 00:40:52.88
And when I met him years later, totally good dude.

733
00:40:52.88 --> 00:40:59.36
But if you would ask me, what was the height and approximate weight of this guy that you saw

734
00:40:59.36 --> 00:41:00.52
that was a seal in boot camp?

735
00:41:00.52 --> 00:41:05.20
I would have said, oh, he was probably, let's call it probably six, five, two, 60.

736
00:41:05.20 --> 00:41:07.92
Because that's what he, in my mind, that's what he was.

737
00:41:07.92 --> 00:41:11.36
And I met him in real life and he was like, like, five, 11.

738
00:41:11.36 --> 00:41:13.76
You know, 190, you know.

739
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:15.36
And that, that's legit.

740
00:41:15.36 --> 00:41:19.40
Like I legitimately thought that he was like that badass.

741
00:41:19.40 --> 00:41:23.48
And I was young, I mean, but still that, when you're, that, when you're young,

742
00:41:23.48 --> 00:41:26.000
you see that, that freaking chicken for the first time.

743
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.60
We were like, oh damn, so you're going to this board with eight of these dudes.

744
00:41:29.60 --> 00:41:33.40
Yeah, I'm one in the highest ranking officers in O6, a seal captain.

745
00:41:33.40 --> 00:41:37.20
And I don't know anything about the ins and outs of the seal teams.

746
00:41:37.20 --> 00:41:45.44
But this is intimidating and everything seems to, you know, depend upon my performance

747
00:41:45.44 --> 00:41:48.20
right here right now in front of these people.

748
00:41:48.20 --> 00:41:51.44
And so I just remember standing outside the room that the guy in front of me is in there.

749
00:41:51.44 --> 00:41:56.40
You know, he comes out and, and I'm like, wow, was it, you know, he's like, like,

750
00:41:56.40 --> 00:41:57.96
shaking his head like this.

751
00:41:57.96 --> 00:42:05.20
So I go in there and, you know, they, they asked me, I think they were leading me down.

752
00:42:05.20 --> 00:42:06.96
So why are you an English major?

753
00:42:06.96 --> 00:42:09.24
Do you write, do you like poetry?

754
00:42:09.24 --> 00:42:11.64
Do you write poems?

755
00:42:11.64 --> 00:42:17.60
And I'm trying to say, well, you serve this as about learning of other people in understanding

756
00:42:17.60 --> 00:42:20.08
situations and developing communication skills.

757
00:42:20.08 --> 00:42:24.44
And I think that'll serve me really well in the community if I'm, if I have the honor

758
00:42:24.44 --> 00:42:26.04
of being selected.

759
00:42:26.04 --> 00:42:31.72
Then they said, you're second choice, you're not putting down service warfare.

760
00:42:31.72 --> 00:42:33.80
What's going on with that?

761
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:36.84
And I said, well, we're at war.

762
00:42:36.84 --> 00:42:40.76
I'd rather be in the Marine Corps if I can't go to Buds.

763
00:42:40.76 --> 00:42:43.68
I'd rather lead a infantry platoon.

764
00:42:43.68 --> 00:42:44.80
At the time, I didn't know.

765
00:42:44.80 --> 00:42:47.76
I think looking back, it's probably the right answer.

766
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:50.76
And I really did, I don't know if the Marines would have taken me.

767
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:52.96
The room are also was, you put them as second.

768
00:42:52.96 --> 00:42:53.96
They're not going to take you.

769
00:42:53.96 --> 00:42:54.96
Yeah.

770
00:42:54.96 --> 00:42:59.04
I've heard that that's like a real catch 22 for guys at the academy because they want

771
00:42:59.04 --> 00:43:00.48
to go in the seal teams.

772
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:04.12
But there's so few bullets, but if you put Marine Corps as number two of the Marines are

773
00:43:04.12 --> 00:43:05.12
like, are you kidding me?

774
00:43:05.12 --> 00:43:07.60
Your Marine Corps should be number one later.

775
00:43:07.60 --> 00:43:09.40
So that's a bummer.

776
00:43:09.40 --> 00:43:11.000
But that I've heard that as well.

777
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.60
Yeah, and in truth be told, I think I'm not going to gain this.

778
00:43:13.60 --> 00:43:15.80
I'm just kind of rank my choices.

779
00:43:15.80 --> 00:43:19.28
And honestly, there's a lot of things that rather do than be on a ship.

780
00:43:19.28 --> 00:43:24.28
And so I'm either going to make it or not into Buds and maybe the Marines will take me

781
00:43:24.28 --> 00:43:25.28
maybe they won't.

782
00:43:25.28 --> 00:43:29.80
But I remember exiting the interview thinking, I have no idea how that would.

783
00:43:29.80 --> 00:43:32.68
Probably it felt like it was forever, but it's probably half an hour.

784
00:43:32.68 --> 00:43:33.96
And did you know nothing?

785
00:43:33.96 --> 00:43:35.48
I'm just sitting here like laughing.

786
00:43:35.48 --> 00:43:37.72
Did you know nothing about anything?

787
00:43:37.72 --> 00:43:40.60
I know they were in retro spec.

788
00:43:40.60 --> 00:43:43.60
They probably knew the people they wanted.

789
00:43:43.60 --> 00:43:45.32
And maybe a couple were on the fence.

790
00:43:45.32 --> 00:43:49.04
I don't know where I stacked in there, but they probably were just scrims.

791
00:43:49.04 --> 00:43:51.76
They probably laughed after after you leave their problems.

792
00:43:51.76 --> 00:43:54.08
Did you meet me these guys later in the teams?

793
00:43:54.08 --> 00:43:55.08
Absolutely.

794
00:43:55.08 --> 00:43:56.08
Did they debrief you at all?

795
00:43:56.08 --> 00:43:57.76
Did they even remember you?

796
00:43:57.76 --> 00:44:01.88
The company officer at the Academy was there and he's still in.

797
00:44:01.88 --> 00:44:05.20
And I have not asked him specifically about that.

798
00:44:05.20 --> 00:44:07.76
But I was ranked fine.

799
00:44:07.76 --> 00:44:09.88
I found out afterwards.

800
00:44:09.88 --> 00:44:11.12
So you were ranked fine.

801
00:44:11.12 --> 00:44:13.68
You find out in January.

802
00:44:13.68 --> 00:44:16.48
That's when you find out where you're going.

803
00:44:16.48 --> 00:44:19.88
That is, yes, there's a day called Service Selection Day.

804
00:44:19.88 --> 00:44:22.76
You're going to go into your company officers room.

805
00:44:22.76 --> 00:44:25.80
Every company, there are 30 companies at the Academy.

806
00:44:25.80 --> 00:44:29.88
The whole, every company is comprised of all four years.

807
00:44:29.88 --> 00:44:34.52
And that company has a company officer from either the actor duty, Navy, or Marine Corps,

808
00:44:34.52 --> 00:44:38.12
and then a company senior enlisted from the Navy, or Marine Corps.

809
00:44:38.12 --> 00:44:40.28
So you go into the company officer's office.

810
00:44:40.28 --> 00:44:45.96
And he's, or she is going to tell you what you've been assigned.

811
00:44:45.96 --> 00:44:47.56
And this is your fate.

812
00:44:47.56 --> 00:44:49.56
You don't get, this is what you're doing.

813
00:44:49.56 --> 00:44:50.56
This is not a debate.

814
00:44:50.56 --> 00:44:53.20
No, you don't get to say, well, this is what that.

815
00:44:53.20 --> 00:44:59.36
If you're assigned to a ship, later that night, you get to choose, and it's somewhat

816
00:44:59.36 --> 00:45:03.000
of a lottery system, I think it actually depends on class rank.

817
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.08
You can choose what ship you want to go on.

818
00:45:07.08 --> 00:45:12.04
But you don't get to contest the fact that you're assigned Service Warfare.

819
00:45:12.04 --> 00:45:16.72
So I go in there and he's printing off a certificate that's going to tell me my fate.

820
00:45:16.72 --> 00:45:17.72
And his back is to me.

821
00:45:17.72 --> 00:45:19.80
I just remember, it's just, my heart is pounding.

822
00:45:19.80 --> 00:45:22.88
What did you think your chances were?

823
00:45:22.88 --> 00:45:26.08
It's tied about 50, 50, 50, 50.

824
00:45:26.08 --> 00:45:27.08
So I go in there.

825
00:45:27.08 --> 00:45:29.88
And the first thing he said, it was, don't worry, you're fine.

826
00:45:29.88 --> 00:45:32.72
What does that mean?

827
00:45:32.72 --> 00:45:35.56
You got what you wanted.

828
00:45:35.56 --> 00:45:38.96
So I remember just feeling absolute relief.

829
00:45:38.96 --> 00:45:44.52
And then about maybe five minutes later, it was late.

830
00:45:44.52 --> 00:45:46.96
I'm going to bud.

831
00:45:46.96 --> 00:45:48.24
Whoa.

832
00:45:48.24 --> 00:45:54.56
And now I'm already starting to feel this apprehension because hell week.

833
00:45:54.56 --> 00:45:55.56
Second phase.

834
00:45:55.56 --> 00:45:56.56
Water.

835
00:45:56.56 --> 00:45:59.60
I got to get ready.

836
00:45:59.60 --> 00:46:03.52
How many of your buddies didn't get picked up?

837
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:05.52
Your good buddies.

838
00:46:05.52 --> 00:46:06.92
One of my, how was that?

839
00:46:06.92 --> 00:46:07.92
Oh, yeah.

840
00:46:07.92 --> 00:46:08.92
Relationship thing.

841
00:46:08.92 --> 00:46:11.12
Because you know, there's like two guys that were like faster than you.

842
00:46:11.12 --> 00:46:13.32
And there was another guy that was smarter than you.

843
00:46:13.32 --> 00:46:16.56
And another guy that was like a better wrestler.

844
00:46:16.56 --> 00:46:22.84
They're just going, yeah, by and large, most of my best friends got a bullet, but one

845
00:46:22.84 --> 00:46:25.04
of my best friends did not.

846
00:46:25.04 --> 00:46:29.72
And one of my other buddies who did the guy that was going on the adventures with, we

847
00:46:29.72 --> 00:46:32.72
came up to his room later that day.

848
00:46:32.72 --> 00:46:36.48
And he started crying in front of us, I won't forget that either.

849
00:46:36.48 --> 00:46:38.000
We all wanted this so bad.

850
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.40
But I think it was more than necessarily the job.

851
00:46:41.40 --> 00:46:43.44
It was, this is what your buddies are doing.

852
00:46:43.44 --> 00:46:45.68
You want to be with your teammates.

853
00:46:45.68 --> 00:46:52.64
So yeah, it's a challenge and you're intrigued by that, but it's about teamwork.

854
00:46:52.64 --> 00:46:55.24
And he was crying and, man, I felt bad for him.

855
00:46:55.24 --> 00:47:02.08
And you know, going on to Buds wanting to stay in touch with him, not knowing how to navigate.

856
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:05.40
How much do I tell about what I'm doing?

857
00:47:05.40 --> 00:47:07.84
Or do I try to protect his feelings and not rule it?

858
00:47:07.84 --> 00:47:11.60
You know, that's, you know, this or that, or whatever.

859
00:47:11.60 --> 00:47:16.88
But I am proud to say that later on when I went to a team, another friend of mine,

860
00:47:16.88 --> 00:47:24.92
we spoke to the Commanding Officer and who apparently had good rapport with the detailer.

861
00:47:24.92 --> 00:47:27.76
And we said there's this guy.

862
00:47:27.76 --> 00:47:31.28
The individual who did not get the billet that year.

863
00:47:31.28 --> 00:47:33.12
And he was able to lateral transfer.

864
00:47:33.12 --> 00:47:36.60
And he is the Commanding Officer of a team.

865
00:47:36.60 --> 00:47:38.60
A team.

866
00:47:38.60 --> 00:47:39.60
Right now.

867
00:47:39.60 --> 00:47:40.60
That's right.

868
00:47:40.60 --> 00:47:45.88
Yeah, I mean, for me, when I was a, when I was a passenger, a stoner and life,

869
00:47:45.88 --> 00:47:48.60
both of those guys didn't get picked up out of the academy.

870
00:47:48.60 --> 00:47:52.84
And they both had to go to the fleet and do the whole lat transfer thing.

871
00:47:52.84 --> 00:48:00.28
And you know, it's all just man, like you said, it's your fate is in the hands of all these different things.

872
00:48:00.28 --> 00:48:02.52
And you can push it and that's a great story.

873
00:48:02.52 --> 00:48:08.68
You know, it's a great story when guys actually stick with it and go to the fleet and do that lateral transfer thing.

874
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:13.24
Oh, that's, that's a game I didn't have to play.

875
00:48:13.24 --> 00:48:15.04
Yeah, in many ways, you were smart.

876
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:22.52
But I will say, I remember there was in the plea beer, the individual who did not get the billet who is now doing quite well in the teams.

877
00:48:22.52 --> 00:48:30.36
Who you know, he, in freshman year, we were talking about what are you going to decide for your major.

878
00:48:30.36 --> 00:48:32.60
You know, you don't have to declare until the springtime.

879
00:48:32.60 --> 00:48:37.64
I was, I want to do English and he goes, I think I'm thinking computer science.

880
00:48:37.64 --> 00:48:41.72
And so he, he just computer science and his grades were not the best.

881
00:48:41.72 --> 00:48:46.52
And so it's, for me, this was English was such a good choice.

882
00:48:46.52 --> 00:48:47.52
Much.

883
00:48:47.52 --> 00:48:48.52
You're close.

884
00:48:48.52 --> 00:48:54.36
I could, I happen to be someone who likes to read and I can maybe not always read all of the book.

885
00:48:54.36 --> 00:49:01.80
It's still right, a decent paper, focus on my math and science and engineering classes to try to get at least to be in those classes to try to have good grades.

886
00:49:01.80 --> 00:49:06.28
Because they are evaluating everything in part of that is your grades.

887
00:49:06.28 --> 00:49:10.84
So September 11 goes down, you get picked up, you're in your final prep.

888
00:49:10.84 --> 00:49:14.92
You must have been feeling decent about the water now that you passed Navy Dive School.

889
00:49:14.92 --> 00:49:17.16
Yes, I'm much more confident in the water.

890
00:49:18.20 --> 00:49:24.60
I felt like I had improved a lot and I knew that anything on land,

891
00:49:25.72 --> 00:49:32.68
I'm going to be just given the perspective of being borderline afraid of the water

892
00:49:32.68 --> 00:49:35.56
that I could use this to my advantage.

893
00:49:36.60 --> 00:49:37.56
I've overcome a fear.

894
00:49:38.28 --> 00:49:39.88
I'm used to being afraid of the water.

895
00:49:41.32 --> 00:49:45.96
There's actually a strength in that learning how to overcome something.

896
00:49:45.96 --> 00:49:51.80
What I did was I walked up to the water's edge just about every day there at the academy for four years

897
00:49:52.60 --> 00:49:58.52
and literally immersed myself in this environment that I am uncomfortable in.

898
00:49:58.52 --> 00:50:09.56
I had a distinct apprehension of jumping out of airplanes as well.

899
00:50:09.56 --> 00:50:14.36
So real stands for Sierra and land, see an air where not my thing.

900
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.88
But the processes of overcoming this fear of the water serve, I think have served me quite well.

901
00:50:21.88 --> 00:50:31.40
And so there's this inner strength that can come from approaching situations that make you uncomfortable.

902
00:50:31.40 --> 00:50:34.20
And you get through this. You take it one small step at a time.

903
00:50:34.20 --> 00:50:36.60
Work on something. There's always something you can work on.

904
00:50:36.60 --> 00:50:40.04
Do one thing today. Do another thing tomorrow.

905
00:50:40.04 --> 00:50:43.48
Over time, this will accumulate and grow.

906
00:50:43.48 --> 00:50:44.84
Yeah, I've thought about that too.

907
00:50:44.84 --> 00:50:51.80
You're jumping out of airplanes. You're fast-ropping. You're repelling. You're diving.

908
00:50:51.80 --> 00:50:55.40
You're diving at night. All these things that are a little bit sketchy if you're not comfortable with them.

909
00:50:55.40 --> 00:50:59.24
And look, the first time you jump out of an airplane, even if like for me, I thought it was going to be fun.

910
00:50:59.24 --> 00:51:00.76
But it's still a little bit sketchy.

911
00:51:00.76 --> 00:51:03.08
First time I fast-rope, like hey, this seems like it's going to be fun.

912
00:51:03.08 --> 00:51:04.28
But it's still a little bit sketchy.

913
00:51:04.28 --> 00:51:07.48
First time you repel off the tower, seems like it's going to be fun.

914
00:51:07.48 --> 00:51:08.68
But it's still a little bit sketchy.

915
00:51:08.68 --> 00:51:16.76
Well, you're building up sort of the mental protocol to be in a fearful situation and just like proceed anyways,

916
00:51:16.76 --> 00:51:19.72
which I think is really good for the first time you're going into combat.

917
00:51:19.72 --> 00:51:22.20
Like, oh, okay, yeah, I know those little butterflies.

918
00:51:22.20 --> 00:51:23.64
No factor. I'm going to push through them.

919
00:51:23.64 --> 00:51:28.28
That's probably a pretty good reason just to do those things in the first place.

920
00:51:28.28 --> 00:51:31.08
Of course, you did it more than I did.

921
00:51:32.12 --> 00:51:35.72
Yeah, I think the first step here is acknowledging what's going on.

922
00:51:35.72 --> 00:51:39.24
Yeah, no, okay, this is the situation. I'm uncomfortable in the water.

923
00:51:39.80 --> 00:51:43.96
Okay, check. Let's come up with a plan of action now.

924
00:51:43.96 --> 00:51:50.92
But yeah, going into Buds, I remember graduated May 24, 2002 from the Naval Academy.

925
00:51:51.32 --> 00:51:58.44
And my report date at Naval Special Warfare Training Command Buds is late June 2002.

926
00:51:58.44 --> 00:51:59.72
So I had about a month off.

927
00:51:59.72 --> 00:52:05.56
We got to choose of the 16 of us who were going to go to Buds with and in what order.

928
00:52:05.56 --> 00:52:07.56
And it was split over three classes.

929
00:52:07.56 --> 00:52:11.32
And I was in the group that was going to go first.

930
00:52:11.32 --> 00:52:14.12
And so we weren't going to have the stories from.

931
00:52:14.12 --> 00:52:17.16
And I thought this is actually probably good.

932
00:52:17.16 --> 00:52:21.96
I was happy with the first first off the deck because we're not going to see

933
00:52:21.96 --> 00:52:23.96
Naval Academy classmates who are further along,

934
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
who maybe can give some wisdom,

935
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.80
but they're also through various stages.

936
00:52:29.80 --> 00:52:32.36
And I just, I'd rather just be the first one to go.

937
00:52:32.36 --> 00:52:33.64
And so that worked out well.

938
00:52:33.64 --> 00:52:38.04
There's a definite like the Naval Academy guys usually do well at Buds.

939
00:52:38.04 --> 00:52:40.92
And if they quit, they're just like hated by everyone.

940
00:52:40.92 --> 00:52:42.52
Because they took a billet.

941
00:52:42.52 --> 00:52:44.28
They took one of those 16 billets.

942
00:52:44.28 --> 00:52:49.96
And everyone just can't believe that you got this opportunity and freaking blew it.

943
00:52:49.96 --> 00:52:52.28
Like, I mean, the, in Lister Guys, like, I didn't care.

944
00:52:52.28 --> 00:52:55.24
I mean, when I was in Lister Guys, I wasn't care for somebody with quit.

945
00:52:55.24 --> 00:52:56.84
For whatever reason, I was like, whatever.

946
00:52:56.84 --> 00:53:00.68
But Naval Academy guys, they take that shit real first.

947
00:53:00.68 --> 00:53:03.80
No, there's some pressure, but I also think that can be an advantage.

948
00:53:03.80 --> 00:53:06.28
I went out to Coronado.

949
00:53:06.28 --> 00:53:10.76
We, the six, so there's actually, there's going to be six, five and five in those three groups.

950
00:53:10.76 --> 00:53:14.68
So I'm going to be going with six, five other classmates from the Naval Academy.

951
00:53:14.68 --> 00:53:17.64
We were packed into an apartment in Imperial Beach.

952
00:53:17.64 --> 00:53:22.12
Three bedrooms, two to a room, like $200 per person a month.

953
00:53:22.12 --> 00:53:23.32
I got it for rent.

954
00:53:23.32 --> 00:53:29.80
And there was no way I could come back to that apartment, having quit.

955
00:53:29.80 --> 00:53:30.92
No way.

956
00:53:30.92 --> 00:53:32.68
How could I, how could I do that?

957
00:53:32.68 --> 00:53:35.24
So you're putting yourself in a situation of your 16 quit?

958
00:53:35.88 --> 00:53:36.76
One.

959
00:53:36.76 --> 00:53:37.24
Yeah.

960
00:53:37.24 --> 00:53:38.36
Not in, not in my group.

961
00:53:38.36 --> 00:53:38.92
Yeah.

962
00:53:39.48 --> 00:53:47.08
But you're putting yourself in a situation where external factors, you know, peer relationships,

963
00:53:47.08 --> 00:53:52.20
this kind of thing can actually, although it could be conceived and construed as adding pressure,

964
00:53:52.20 --> 00:53:58.76
I think it actually made, you know, at these kind of, you're at your breaking point moments.

965
00:53:58.76 --> 00:54:05.48
This was maybe just a subliminal nudge in the direction of the do not, do not succumb,

966
00:54:05.48 --> 00:54:07.88
do not quit, push through, let's go.

967
00:54:07.88 --> 00:54:11.40
How was like so detached from people quitting?

968
00:54:11.40 --> 00:54:14.36
I didn't even understand what was happening.

969
00:54:14.36 --> 00:54:15.16
Like people were just quitting.

970
00:54:15.16 --> 00:54:19.32
I was like, I was saying this the other day, like they didn't seem like human to me.

971
00:54:19.32 --> 00:54:24.20
Like, they didn't seem like a human, like, all this guy, I didn't, I didn't picture a person with,

972
00:54:24.20 --> 00:54:27.000
like, hopes and dreams and that can't believe they just did that and they,

973
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.04
they joined the Navy and now they're quitting, like, oh gosh, what?

974
00:54:30.04 --> 00:54:35.40
I was just like, oh, that this person just, a nonhuman thing that just like is moving on and they're

975
00:54:35.40 --> 00:54:36.68
not part of what we're doing.

976
00:54:36.68 --> 00:54:41.56
And so I wasn't even, I can't even name, I can only name one guy that quit and he was my

977
00:54:41.56 --> 00:54:45.64
boat crew leader and he was my boat crew leader in hell week, but that's the only, everyone else

978
00:54:45.64 --> 00:54:50.04
was just like, gone, I just never even thought about him, never even, and I never had thoughts,

979
00:54:50.04 --> 00:54:52.84
like, oh, I, you know, this guy's my friend.

980
00:54:52.84 --> 00:54:53.88
So I never thought like that.

981
00:54:53.88 --> 00:54:55.88
I was like, oh, we're just doing this.

982
00:54:55.88 --> 00:54:56.88
Oh, what do you want to say?

983
00:54:56.88 --> 00:55:01.56
Climate is rocks, you want to jump in the water, whatever, like, like, I was like, you said,

984
00:55:01.56 --> 00:55:05.64
oh, maybe, you mentioned real quick, I said, well, you know, I, I didn't have to go through all

985
00:55:05.64 --> 00:55:08.44
that stuff in the Navy, I got to me like, yeah, maybe you're smarter and I was like, no,

986
00:55:08.44 --> 00:55:10.44
in my mind, I was like, no, I was dumb.

987
00:55:10.44 --> 00:55:13.88
I was just like, oh, I'm going in the Navy, I want to be a seal.

988
00:55:13.88 --> 00:55:15.48
They told me to do something, I'm going to do it.

989
00:55:15.48 --> 00:55:17.28
Like, that was my attitude.

990
00:55:17.28 --> 00:55:19.60
So, and it might have been beneficial.

991
00:55:19.60 --> 00:55:25.84
It seems like it was beneficial, but it also disconnected me from even really any recognition.

992
00:55:25.84 --> 00:55:32.12
You know, of how hard seal training is because to me, I was like, there was just two groups

993
00:55:32.12 --> 00:55:36.80
of people, me and my buddies and everyone else, and we didn't know them and they just

994
00:55:36.80 --> 00:55:39.08
went away and then we were all going to the teams.

995
00:55:39.08 --> 00:55:41.16
It was like, oh, who yeah, we're going to the teams.

996
00:55:41.16 --> 00:55:46.44
So it was almost like this weird, like now when I hear some of the statistics and you know

997
00:55:46.44 --> 00:55:53.04
more about it and you know that guys that are, went to the Naval Academy and guys that

998
00:55:53.04 --> 00:55:58.88
were, you know, uh, uh, freaky and division one, squimmers and division one, wrestlers and

999
00:55:58.88 --> 00:56:01.32
division one football players and they all quit.

1000
00:56:01.32 --> 00:56:04.72
And like, that didn't even, I just thought there was a bunch of guys that we just didn't

1001
00:56:04.72 --> 00:56:05.84
want to be here and I do.

1002
00:56:05.84 --> 00:56:07.84
So that was that kind of crazy.

1003
00:56:07.84 --> 00:56:12.20
Yeah, I remember someone giving me advice, I collected along the way, three pieces of

1004
00:56:12.20 --> 00:56:13.20
advice.

1005
00:56:13.20 --> 00:56:17.32
Number one in how weak eat like it's your job.

1006
00:56:17.32 --> 00:56:19.84
Don't ever let a eat no matter how hard you are.

1007
00:56:19.84 --> 00:56:22.000
Eat eat eat eat.

1008
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:30.08
Second was give 70% effort 100% of the time trying not to have to ever give 100% but

1009
00:56:30.08 --> 00:56:34.32
a good 70% effort 100% of the time sustainable.

1010
00:56:34.32 --> 00:56:39.76
And then third was don't get close to anybody because you don't know if they're going

1011
00:56:39.76 --> 00:56:40.76
to quit.

1012
00:56:40.76 --> 00:56:44.76
I'm wondering if when you're boat crew leader quit, if that affected you.

1013
00:56:44.76 --> 00:56:48.52
I hear I hear when it off, it sounds like it didn't, but you hear stories about when

1014
00:56:48.52 --> 00:56:52.24
an officer quit three or four people go with that person.

1015
00:56:52.24 --> 00:56:56.64
Yeah, I forget what my buddy gift went through how weak we, he was on here the other

1016
00:56:56.64 --> 00:56:59.80
day and we were talking about and he just said like he was laughing, he's like you just

1017
00:56:59.80 --> 00:57:02.28
looked at him and like all right, whatever and we just like carried on.

1018
00:57:02.28 --> 00:57:04.08
He was like, yeah, no factor.

1019
00:57:04.08 --> 00:57:06.08
I was too like, I was too crazy.

1020
00:57:06.08 --> 00:57:11.08
I guess I was too just weird, I guess, or crazy or something.

1021
00:57:11.08 --> 00:57:15.88
Did you have any challenges during but like when you got to pool comp, how was that?

1022
00:57:15.88 --> 00:57:20.44
Did you have any challenges with the five and a half nautical mile swim or anything like

1023
00:57:20.44 --> 00:57:21.44
that?

1024
00:57:21.44 --> 00:57:27.36
You know, I think what I saw in Buds with my class was no matter how gifted a person was,

1025
00:57:27.36 --> 00:57:32.20
there was probably going to be something at some point that was going to challenge them

1026
00:57:32.20 --> 00:57:36.16
and one of the one of my classmates, this individual from the Naval Academy who I had known

1027
00:57:36.16 --> 00:57:40.80
for four years at this point, was just a stud in Buds and there was one day at the very

1028
00:57:40.80 --> 00:57:47.44
end for whatever reason the obstacle course rope with the low wall, the one he had, the

1029
00:57:47.44 --> 00:57:48.44
high low.

1030
00:57:48.44 --> 00:57:50.32
You send the rope and then kind of roll over.

1031
00:57:50.32 --> 00:57:52.92
The rope was wet and he just had a really hard time.

1032
00:57:52.92 --> 00:57:53.92
I hope.

1033
00:57:53.92 --> 00:57:58.08
I'm not if he's listening, I hope he's not bringing up some bad memories.

1034
00:57:58.08 --> 00:57:59.64
He's like, feet, yes, yes.

1035
00:57:59.64 --> 00:58:01.84
For me, you know, I actually did quite well in pool week.

1036
00:58:01.84 --> 00:58:04.04
I had maybe having gone to dive school.

1037
00:58:04.04 --> 00:58:09.24
Yeah, I was going to have to have had to help to me and I remember in dive school, the first

1038
00:58:09.24 --> 00:58:14.08
just feeling really uncomfortable breathing underwater, just was weird.

1039
00:58:14.08 --> 00:58:20.92
But by the time second phase dive phase of Buds comes around, that was the double hose regulator

1040
00:58:20.92 --> 00:58:23.52
was new because we were using a single hose and dive school.

1041
00:58:23.52 --> 00:58:27.36
Oh, yeah, you know, in the Aqua Lung Aqua Master.

1042
00:58:27.36 --> 00:58:34.44
Yeah, there was one evolution known, it's life-saving.

1043
00:58:34.44 --> 00:58:38.68
I forget if that was pre or post-Hoh, I want to say it was pre-Hoh week, but I think it's

1044
00:58:38.68 --> 00:58:46.92
pre- we had some large instructors who had weight belts on and they bring it in.

1045
00:58:46.92 --> 00:58:48.92
I failed the first time.

1046
00:58:48.92 --> 00:58:51.84
Did your world come crashing down?

1047
00:58:51.84 --> 00:58:58.56
Yeah, he was just taking me under and the second time I failed and it was like the third

1048
00:58:58.56 --> 00:58:59.56
time.

1049
00:58:59.56 --> 00:59:02.56
I'm sitting in the line of your shame.

1050
00:59:02.56 --> 00:59:06.24
Yeah, where you failed and now you have to, this is your chance.

1051
00:59:06.24 --> 00:59:11.12
And I'm thinking, is this it?

1052
00:59:11.12 --> 00:59:16.72
So I just really tried to focus on the procedure and trying to do it.

1053
00:59:16.72 --> 00:59:21.44
And number one, like what I was failing was the fact that this instructor was underwater.

1054
00:59:21.44 --> 00:59:25.52
So like number one thing is keep this person's head up of the water.

1055
00:59:25.52 --> 00:59:28.92
I don't care if I'm drinking water, if I'm under water the whole time, his head needs

1056
00:59:28.92 --> 00:59:32.40
to be above the water and the entire time.

1057
00:59:32.40 --> 00:59:34.32
And I get to the wall and it was a pass.

1058
00:59:34.32 --> 00:59:36.20
No, it was just like, well, take it.

1059
00:59:36.20 --> 00:59:41.04
Yeah, and I hope I didn't come across like Buds was easy for me.

1060
00:59:41.04 --> 00:59:48.28
Because I failed to run, I failed to swim, I failed pull comp and actually here's the

1061
00:59:48.28 --> 00:59:49.64
funny thing.

1062
00:59:49.64 --> 00:59:51.80
For life saving, I got so ready for life saving.

1063
00:59:51.80 --> 00:59:53.64
I was like, I was like, hostel.

1064
00:59:53.64 --> 00:59:57.80
I was like, oh, I'm gonna fight some dudes and it was like that back then.

1065
00:59:57.80 --> 00:59:59.16
I don't feel like that when you went through.

1066
00:59:59.16 --> 01:00:00.20
It sounds like it was.

1067
01:00:00.20 --> 01:00:01.20
It was a fight.

1068
01:00:01.20 --> 01:00:02.96
Like you're gonna fight this person.

1069
01:00:02.96 --> 01:00:05.56
And so I was super amped up for that.

1070
01:00:05.56 --> 01:00:11.52
I went out, got first in line and in pull comp, I failed pull comp on Friday and over the

1071
01:00:11.52 --> 01:00:15.72
weekend, mean my buddy who's now an active duty master chief.

1072
01:00:15.72 --> 01:00:17.72
He failed to.

1073
01:00:17.72 --> 01:00:19.36
And we spent, I don't know how we did this.

1074
01:00:19.36 --> 01:00:20.36
I don't know how this was legal.

1075
01:00:20.36 --> 01:00:21.52
I don't know if it was legal.

1076
01:00:21.52 --> 01:00:26.36
We spent the weekend in the dip tank with with charge to win in.

1077
01:00:26.36 --> 01:00:27.68
He's, I don't know how we got him.

1078
01:00:27.68 --> 01:00:32.08
And we just freaking pull comp to each other in four feet of water.

1079
01:00:32.08 --> 01:00:33.88
Like we're standing outside the dip tank.

1080
01:00:33.88 --> 01:00:34.88
I'm in the dip tank.

1081
01:00:34.88 --> 01:00:38.68
He's standing there just ripping my face and we did that for the whole weekend.

1082
01:00:38.68 --> 01:00:40.08
The whole weekend we did that.

1083
01:00:40.08 --> 01:00:43.36
I got on Monday morning I went in there.

1084
01:00:43.36 --> 01:00:46.96
The instructor came down and this instructor ended up being an abrol.

1085
01:00:46.96 --> 01:00:51.60
He came down and as soon as I saw him coming down, I ripped off my own face mask and spit

1086
01:00:51.60 --> 01:00:54.84
out my mouth piece like can bring it dude.

1087
01:00:54.84 --> 01:00:59.60
And he sure enough he was like dude, this guy is obviously very confident and he messed

1088
01:00:59.60 --> 01:01:00.60
me up.

1089
01:01:00.60 --> 01:01:02.12
Like you know, pass.

1090
01:01:02.12 --> 01:01:06.52
So I kind of would go a little bit extra on something.

1091
01:01:06.52 --> 01:01:13.28
But I don't want to make it sound like it was easy for me because like I said, in fact,

1092
01:01:13.28 --> 01:01:14.28
I failed to run.

1093
01:01:14.28 --> 01:01:15.28
I failed to swim.

1094
01:01:15.28 --> 01:01:17.40
Not like I can promise you I never won a run.

1095
01:01:17.40 --> 01:01:19.08
I never won a swim.

1096
01:01:19.08 --> 01:01:20.68
I never won an O course.

1097
01:01:20.68 --> 01:01:23.24
I was like in the middle of everything.

1098
01:01:23.24 --> 01:01:26.08
And that was about, that was about all I had to.

1099
01:01:26.08 --> 01:01:30.28
Like when I failed to run it was because I didn't, I tried to pace myself.

1100
01:01:30.28 --> 01:01:32.32
A little bit and failed.

1101
01:01:32.32 --> 01:01:35.76
So my only way to pass a run was to run as hard as I possibly could the entire time.

1102
01:01:35.76 --> 01:01:36.76
100%.

1103
01:01:36.76 --> 01:01:37.76
Yeah, not 70%.

1104
01:01:37.76 --> 01:01:38.76
100%.

1105
01:01:38.76 --> 01:01:39.76
No, it was 100%.

1106
01:01:39.76 --> 01:01:40.76
100%.

1107
01:01:40.76 --> 01:01:41.76
That's how I had to do it.

1108
01:01:41.76 --> 01:01:42.76
Yeah.

1109
01:01:42.76 --> 01:01:44.52
It's a run to pass a swim to pass everything.

1110
01:01:44.52 --> 01:01:49.24
So your only big challenge though was life saving.

1111
01:01:49.24 --> 01:01:50.24
Life saving.

1112
01:01:50.24 --> 01:01:57.44
But there was a moment in the beginning stages of hell week where, and I can tell the story,

1113
01:01:57.44 --> 01:02:03.08
I was at a decision point.

1114
01:02:03.08 --> 01:02:05.60
At my, I would say my breaking point.

1115
01:02:05.60 --> 01:02:07.60
And a lot of this was because we got frustration.

1116
01:02:07.60 --> 01:02:10.40
Oh, they're going to get you from that frustration.

1117
01:02:10.40 --> 01:02:15.32
Frustration with physical pain can be a really potent combination.

1118
01:02:15.32 --> 01:02:18.44
And hell week starts on a Sunday.

1119
01:02:18.44 --> 01:02:20.48
You know it's going to end Friday.

1120
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:23.32
You're going to not sleep once until some time on Wednesday.

1121
01:02:23.32 --> 01:02:25.20
All these thoughts are going through my head.

1122
01:02:25.20 --> 01:02:27.68
70% of my clad 80% are going to quit.

1123
01:02:27.68 --> 01:02:28.68
And I'm not going to make it.

1124
01:02:28.68 --> 01:02:31.56
Am I going to be one of the ones who gets through all these looking around.

1125
01:02:31.56 --> 01:02:34.32
You're in an isolation room waiting for this thing to start.

1126
01:02:34.32 --> 01:02:36.32
Just all these thoughts going through your head.

1127
01:02:36.32 --> 01:02:37.96
You know what I was thinking at that time?

1128
01:02:37.96 --> 01:02:41.52
Just like, oh, wait, wait, wait.

1129
01:02:41.52 --> 01:02:42.52
This is going to start.

1130
01:02:42.52 --> 01:02:44.52
I want pizza.

1131
01:02:44.52 --> 01:02:46.52
So you're having all these advanced thoughts.

1132
01:02:46.52 --> 01:02:47.76
Yeah, I'm not going to be like just nothing.

1133
01:02:47.76 --> 01:02:49.16
I'm like a freaking idiot.

1134
01:02:49.16 --> 01:02:53.08
You know, I'm thinking all this stuff and you know, who knows he's going to quit?

1135
01:02:53.08 --> 01:02:55.16
Don't get close to anybody.

1136
01:02:55.16 --> 01:03:00.000
And we break out and it's just chaos and form up the longest amount.

1137
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.36
You go all the way down with the boats on your head to that bottom end of the silver strand,

1138
01:03:03.36 --> 01:03:05.16
racing your tired.

1139
01:03:05.16 --> 01:03:07.60
It's not comfortable.

1140
01:03:07.60 --> 01:03:12.20
It means, but at this point it's like, I'm in this.

1141
01:03:12.20 --> 01:03:13.40
I mean, you're in it.

1142
01:03:13.40 --> 01:03:14.40
You're in it.

1143
01:03:14.40 --> 01:03:18.24
And so all that anxiety and build up and apprehension has kind of dissipated because

1144
01:03:18.24 --> 01:03:19.48
I'm just in this now.

1145
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:26.48
Performing up for the second race, this part of the longest mile with the logs, logs,

1146
01:03:26.48 --> 01:03:32.40
or the section telephone poles and my team steps up to a government pickup truck, receiving

1147
01:03:32.40 --> 01:03:38.40
our log and this thing was just insanely heavy.

1148
01:03:38.40 --> 01:03:39.96
I don't know what was going on with it.

1149
01:03:39.96 --> 01:03:41.96
It wasn't old misery.

1150
01:03:41.96 --> 01:03:43.60
I don't know what was going on.

1151
01:03:43.60 --> 01:03:45.04
It felt like it was water log.

1152
01:03:45.04 --> 01:03:47.36
Yep, they could probably could have been waterlogged.

1153
01:03:47.36 --> 01:03:49.52
And maybe the instructors knew, maybe they didn't.

1154
01:03:49.52 --> 01:03:50.52
I don't know.

1155
01:03:50.52 --> 01:03:52.52
They knew.

1156
01:03:52.52 --> 01:03:58.08
And I just remember, we had one of the guys in the boat and I guarantee you every single

1157
01:03:58.08 --> 01:04:00.000
person under that log.

1158
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.16
It remembers this log.

1159
01:04:02.16 --> 01:04:04.96
It was just so heavy.

1160
01:04:04.96 --> 01:04:07.56
I mean, and you know what a log is supposed to weigh.

1161
01:04:07.56 --> 01:04:08.84
You've done this stuff before.

1162
01:04:08.84 --> 01:04:10.48
I'm immediately grown.

1163
01:04:10.48 --> 01:04:12.76
And there was a guy on the boat team.

1164
01:04:12.76 --> 01:04:17.000
You'd been through, I think, three days of hell week before and two years before, gone

1165
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.44
to the fleet come back and immediately was saying, this log is a career ender.

1166
01:04:22.44 --> 01:04:26.56
This is not good.

1167
01:04:26.56 --> 01:04:30.88
So we received the brief, you know, log carried north, bust him, go.

1168
01:04:30.88 --> 01:04:35.64
It races on and just all the teams in the class were just out of sight.

1169
01:04:35.64 --> 01:04:39.56
You couldn't hear, see the second to last place team, even.

1170
01:04:39.56 --> 01:04:40.56
This is bad.

1171
01:04:40.56 --> 01:04:41.56
This is way.

1172
01:04:41.56 --> 01:04:44.64
So you guys are so far back to last place team.

1173
01:04:44.64 --> 01:04:49.64
I mean, like every the whole class is just gone.

1174
01:04:49.64 --> 01:04:54.24
And we are all by ourselves at the last place.

1175
01:04:54.24 --> 01:04:58.56
So of course, the instructors descended upon us like a pack of wolves, you know, with their

1176
01:04:58.56 --> 01:05:02.96
mega phones and hurry up, step it out, move it out, let's go.

1177
01:05:02.96 --> 01:05:08.36
And then there was this instructor in my face and this person had a unique ability to really

1178
01:05:08.36 --> 01:05:10.40
get under my nerves.

1179
01:05:10.40 --> 01:05:12.84
And he's telling me he's going to kick me out of the program.

1180
01:05:12.84 --> 01:05:14.56
We need to step it out.

1181
01:05:14.56 --> 01:05:15.96
I'm at the far left end of the log.

1182
01:05:15.96 --> 01:05:17.32
Are you the boat crew leader?

1183
01:05:17.32 --> 01:05:20.64
Yes, far left end of the log.

1184
01:05:20.64 --> 01:05:24.24
We're the weight tends to collect and the person to my right.

1185
01:05:24.24 --> 01:05:27.84
It just 10, you know, 10, 15, 20 minutes into this.

1186
01:05:27.84 --> 01:05:31.32
I have no conception of time, but we're into this race now.

1187
01:05:31.32 --> 01:05:33.48
We're in last place and it seemed like his arms.

1188
01:05:33.48 --> 01:05:34.48
There just wasn't much.

1189
01:05:34.48 --> 01:05:36.72
So you can feel the increase of the weight.

1190
01:05:36.72 --> 01:05:38.08
And I'm at the far left end of the log.

1191
01:05:38.08 --> 01:05:42.96
So it felt like I was carrying two people's worth of weight on the far left end of this

1192
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:45.12
log that was so heavy.

1193
01:05:45.12 --> 01:05:50.08
I felt it literally felt like my arms were going to just rip out of the shoulder

1194
01:05:50.08 --> 01:05:51.08
socks.

1195
01:05:51.08 --> 01:05:53.48
My biceps were totally on fire.

1196
01:05:53.48 --> 01:05:58.32
Every step, just horrendous.

1197
01:05:58.32 --> 01:06:06.24
And I started just succumbing to self-doubt, frustration, thinking long-term thought.

1198
01:06:06.24 --> 01:06:08.52
How am I going to, this is, I'm just a few hours into how we come.

1199
01:06:08.52 --> 01:06:10.84
How am I going to make it like, to Friday?

1200
01:06:10.84 --> 01:06:15.96
Friday seems impossible if our weight, and this log is destroying my body.

1201
01:06:15.96 --> 01:06:16.96
This is not good.

1202
01:06:16.96 --> 01:06:17.96
It's not good.

1203
01:06:17.96 --> 01:06:22.88
I worked years to get to this point and things are just unraveling fast.

1204
01:06:22.88 --> 01:06:24.16
It's not a good start to help.

1205
01:06:24.16 --> 01:06:27.84
We're only a few hours in, middle of the night.

1206
01:06:27.84 --> 01:06:33.20
And there was this moment where I remember looking up into the sky as we're struggling to

1207
01:06:33.20 --> 01:06:38.80
advance this log forward through the soft sand in last place and just thinking, I can't

1208
01:06:38.80 --> 01:06:39.80
do.

1209
01:06:39.80 --> 01:06:40.80
This is just too much.

1210
01:06:40.80 --> 01:06:44.32
It's frustrating because these instructors and they don't, you know, I just wanted to scream

1211
01:06:44.32 --> 01:06:45.84
this isn't fair.

1212
01:06:45.84 --> 01:06:49.72
This is not, this log is not the right kind of weight.

1213
01:06:49.72 --> 01:06:51.72
It's not a fair race.

1214
01:06:51.72 --> 01:06:53.52
But I couldn't say that.

1215
01:06:53.52 --> 01:06:56.80
And they didn't know or let onto their knowledge that this log was too heavy.

1216
01:06:56.80 --> 01:07:03.68
So at this critical point where I just had a frustration, I was just about to walk away.

1217
01:07:03.68 --> 01:07:09.16
I remember, I just had this idea of like playing this game.

1218
01:07:09.16 --> 01:07:12.52
And it's all in my mind.

1219
01:07:12.52 --> 01:07:15.80
But I could quit, but first, you know, take a few more steps.

1220
01:07:15.80 --> 01:07:18.40
I'd take those steps with that.

1221
01:07:18.40 --> 01:07:21.16
Okay, you can just keep playing this game.

1222
01:07:21.16 --> 01:07:22.52
Okay, take a few more steps.

1223
01:07:22.52 --> 01:07:23.52
Okay, I've done that.

1224
01:07:23.52 --> 01:07:24.84
Let's just keep playing this game.

1225
01:07:24.84 --> 01:07:29.20
And so I just got to net rhythm and then I started yelling some encouragement to the

1226
01:07:29.20 --> 01:07:31.20
team and let's go.

1227
01:07:31.20 --> 01:07:32.20
Let's go.

1228
01:07:32.20 --> 01:07:33.20
Let's go.

1229
01:07:33.20 --> 01:07:34.20
And they probably want to be shut up.

1230
01:07:34.20 --> 01:07:39.12
But this game, I learned a lesson like, okay, you got to, when you have these

1231
01:07:39.12 --> 01:07:43.60
situations to push your your limit, you may have long-term goals.

1232
01:07:43.60 --> 01:07:46.60
You know, I wanted to be a Navy seal, and I'll, it seemed like really far away.

1233
01:07:46.60 --> 01:07:52.84
And as I, you know, think about this and unpack this experience, what I have learned

1234
01:07:52.84 --> 01:07:59.12
is that a way to get your mind away from these long-term thoughts that can only be discouraging

1235
01:07:59.12 --> 01:08:04.12
is to just focus on mechanics and procedure and process, support the law with my arms,

1236
01:08:04.12 --> 01:08:06.36
advance it with my team one step at a time.

1237
01:08:06.36 --> 01:08:07.60
That's all I need to be thinking about, right?

1238
01:08:07.60 --> 01:08:09.08
I know, and just you learn that.

1239
01:08:09.08 --> 01:08:13.52
I learned that in that night, right then and there in that rate.

1240
01:08:13.52 --> 01:08:17.16
Yeah, of course we finished last place and we got hammered.

1241
01:08:17.16 --> 01:08:22.20
But because, you know, it pays to be a winner and they want to drive home this lesson that

1242
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:24.56
losing in combat has severe consequences.

1243
01:08:24.56 --> 01:08:26.32
You need to find ways to win.

1244
01:08:26.32 --> 01:08:28.80
There's no way in hell we were going to win under this log.

1245
01:08:28.80 --> 01:08:30.60
But that punishment occurred.

1246
01:08:30.60 --> 01:08:35.92
The log was a way we were just, I don't know, doing air squads or bare-cr- whatever it was,

1247
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:40.16
it was better than being under that log and I knew that I just got through that.

1248
01:08:40.16 --> 01:08:44.92
There was nothing, nothing this week that can be that bad.

1249
01:08:44.92 --> 01:08:46.16
And nothing was that bad.

1250
01:08:46.16 --> 01:08:52.24
And I remember laying in the surf zone, surf torture sessions, all I would need to do was

1251
01:08:52.24 --> 01:08:54.52
just think, man, this is rest.

1252
01:08:54.52 --> 01:08:56.88
At least I'm not under that log.

1253
01:08:56.88 --> 01:08:58.36
My whole perspective, it changed.

1254
01:08:58.36 --> 01:08:59.36
I got through it.

1255
01:08:59.36 --> 01:09:00.36
I learned that lesson.

1256
01:09:00.36 --> 01:09:08.36
I focused on one step at a time and advancing it in one, one, but this, I think every person

1257
01:09:08.36 --> 01:09:13.76
who gets through hell week at some form, whether they process this consciously or not.

1258
01:09:13.76 --> 01:09:19.80
But you have to break down long-term massive challenges into increments.

1259
01:09:19.80 --> 01:09:23.40
Things that you can do right now that add up over time to get through a very difficult

1260
01:09:23.40 --> 01:09:24.40
situation.

1261
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:28.12
That lesson was very valuable for me.

1262
01:09:28.12 --> 01:09:30.72
No, that's a good one.

1263
01:09:30.72 --> 01:09:36.16
Like I said, from my perspective, it was just like, I never even was thinking that far.

1264
01:09:36.16 --> 01:09:40.24
So I was like, what, carry this log, cool, got it.

1265
01:09:40.24 --> 01:09:49.84
Too much of a knuckle dragger to process these kind of big picture strategic thoughts about

1266
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:50.84
my life.

1267
01:09:50.84 --> 01:09:53.72
Yeah, you know, maybe I'm prone to overthinking.

1268
01:09:53.72 --> 01:09:59.96
And so there is something to be said for just doing it, not think, you know, just do

1269
01:09:59.96 --> 01:10:01.16
what you got to do.

1270
01:10:01.16 --> 01:10:04.28
You know, I remember thinking when I was in hell week, I was like, oh, it's going to feel

1271
01:10:04.28 --> 01:10:06.16
so good to go to sleep.

1272
01:10:06.16 --> 01:10:12.24
I was almost, like, my anticipation, I was going to feel so cool to stay awake for so long

1273
01:10:12.24 --> 01:10:13.24
because I'm not now good.

1274
01:10:13.24 --> 01:10:14.24
It's going to feel a fall asleep one.

1275
01:10:14.24 --> 01:10:15.76
And a week, that's going to be so cool.

1276
01:10:15.76 --> 01:10:17.96
It's going to feel so good to just like, laid down.

1277
01:10:17.96 --> 01:10:22.80
And I was kind of excited about the prospect of having stayed awake for so long, but then

1278
01:10:22.80 --> 01:10:23.80
I got to go to sleep.

1279
01:10:23.80 --> 01:10:30.48
The only way you can get to get that much pleasure in sleeping is to stay awake for that

1280
01:10:30.48 --> 01:10:31.48
long.

1281
01:10:31.48 --> 01:10:32.96
Otherwise, it's just kind of a pain to go to sleep.

1282
01:10:32.96 --> 01:10:33.96
It's like a waste of time.

1283
01:10:33.96 --> 01:10:37.80
It feels like it's like bad.

1284
01:10:37.80 --> 01:10:41.92
So thankfully, you made it through how many people started in your Buds class.

1285
01:10:41.92 --> 01:10:42.92
Do you remember?

1286
01:10:42.92 --> 01:10:48.24
Oh, we had when we classed up, I believe it was 196 that number sticks in my mind.

1287
01:10:48.24 --> 01:10:50.24
It seems like a pretty, a little bit of a small number.

1288
01:10:50.24 --> 01:10:51.24
It was classed up.

1289
01:10:51.24 --> 01:10:55.72
So June of 2002, we classed up.

1290
01:10:55.72 --> 01:11:00.60
Hell Week was laid August 2002, summer, hell week.

1291
01:11:00.60 --> 01:11:02.44
So the Surf Torture Sessions weren't that bad.

1292
01:11:02.44 --> 01:11:03.76
They just leave you in longer.

1293
01:11:03.76 --> 01:11:04.76
But again, it's just rest.

1294
01:11:04.76 --> 01:11:06.76
They had just got.

1295
01:11:06.76 --> 01:11:14.12
And I believe we graduated 26 original, but we had rollbacks along the way.

1296
01:11:14.12 --> 01:11:15.12
You get done.

1297
01:11:15.12 --> 01:11:16.52
So those were your major challenges.

1298
01:11:16.52 --> 01:11:17.52
Little bit of a lifestyle.

1299
01:11:17.52 --> 01:11:18.52
Two big challenges.

1300
01:11:18.52 --> 01:11:20.52
Yep.

1301
01:11:20.52 --> 01:11:22.40
You get done.

1302
01:11:22.40 --> 01:11:25.48
And you get assigned to a team.

1303
01:11:25.48 --> 01:11:26.68
What team you end up going to?

1304
01:11:26.68 --> 01:11:28.000
West Coast team team one.

1305
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So you end up going to team one.

1306
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.60
Did you want to go to the West Coast?

1307
01:11:30.60 --> 01:11:31.36
Yeah, I chose that.

1308
01:11:31.36 --> 01:11:33.84
I had that cornado on your mind.

1309
01:11:33.84 --> 01:11:37.80
Yeah, you know, being from Kansas, I've been East Coast at the Naval Academy.

1310
01:11:37.80 --> 01:11:44.44
And you know, the thing is, when you get to a team, nobody cares that you went through

1311
01:11:44.44 --> 01:11:45.44
hell week.

1312
01:11:45.44 --> 01:11:46.44
Yep.

1313
01:11:46.44 --> 01:11:47.44
Nobody cares.

1314
01:11:47.44 --> 01:11:48.44
We'll be curious.

1315
01:11:48.44 --> 01:11:53.000
As I've been working for years, they no longer matter.

1316
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.80
Did you get your Trident after SQT?

1317
01:11:54.80 --> 01:11:55.80
Yes.

1318
01:11:55.80 --> 01:12:02.20
So September 2003, I reported that West Coast team in October 2003.

1319
01:12:02.20 --> 01:12:03.60
Is a new guy.

1320
01:12:03.60 --> 01:12:07.08
So you show up and you get put right into a poll too?

1321
01:12:07.08 --> 01:12:08.08
No.

1322
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:10.76
The policy at that team at that time was.

1323
01:12:10.76 --> 01:12:16.36
And they were, the detailing was a little off in the sense that they were just a few

1324
01:12:16.36 --> 01:12:21.88
months away and ended up doing a surge deployment.

1325
01:12:21.88 --> 01:12:26.84
So to the team had to do a surge deployment to a rat.

1326
01:12:26.84 --> 01:12:30.64
I think I kind of forget the particulars, but maybe more platoons were needed.

1327
01:12:30.64 --> 01:12:31.64
Is this an O4?

1328
01:12:31.64 --> 01:12:32.64
Yes.

1329
01:12:32.64 --> 01:12:33.64
And you are a team one.

1330
01:12:33.64 --> 01:12:34.64
Yes.

1331
01:12:34.64 --> 01:12:35.64
And you went on deployment.

1332
01:12:35.64 --> 01:12:36.64
Yes.

1333
01:12:36.64 --> 01:12:38.36
In less than four months after arriving.

1334
01:12:38.36 --> 01:12:43.36
You went on deployment in the, what time of year?

1335
01:12:43.36 --> 01:12:48.36
Is it January 04? I believe there was some kind of a surge happening within the community.

1336
01:12:48.36 --> 01:12:50.24
And so I got to that team.

1337
01:12:50.24 --> 01:12:52.76
They were already well through their work up.

1338
01:12:52.76 --> 01:12:57.44
And so the policy, there were several of us, junior officers who were just kind of

1339
01:12:57.44 --> 01:12:59.000
floating around.

1340
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.60
And the policy was not to put the third officer in a platoon at that team at that time.

1341
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:04.60
So did you go on deployment?

1342
01:13:04.60 --> 01:13:05.60
Yeah, I did.

1343
01:13:05.60 --> 01:13:06.60
I did a platoot at the Pacific.

1344
01:13:06.60 --> 01:13:07.60
Okay.

1345
01:13:07.60 --> 01:13:11.88
Got to always at team 7 and team 1 relieved us.

1346
01:13:11.88 --> 01:13:12.88
That's why.

1347
01:13:12.88 --> 01:13:16.68
So if you were to go into Iraq, you would have high five with me in Iraq because I was

1348
01:13:16.68 --> 01:13:17.68
getting ready to head home.

1349
01:13:17.68 --> 01:13:18.68
I was not in that group.

1350
01:13:18.68 --> 01:13:19.68
I was, I was bummed.

1351
01:13:19.68 --> 01:13:25.64
You know, when you think at the Naval Academy that you've now been selected to go to

1352
01:13:25.64 --> 01:13:28.44
Buds 9-11 just happened, this is for real.

1353
01:13:28.44 --> 01:13:29.60
We're going to war.

1354
01:13:29.60 --> 01:13:37.24
You go through Buds hell week, it's such land warfare, everything, SKT, you get to a team.

1355
01:13:37.24 --> 01:13:45.84
You're deploying to war, I did not realize that some platoons deploy to non-combat environments

1356
01:13:45.84 --> 01:13:49.80
even when there is combat going on.

1357
01:13:49.80 --> 01:13:52.84
And that was a surprise to me.

1358
01:13:52.84 --> 01:13:56.80
Not exactly what I expected, but I'm a new guy.

1359
01:13:56.80 --> 01:13:58.72
And so you go where you're told.

1360
01:13:58.72 --> 01:14:03.44
And a lot of people may not realize this, but platoons don't often get to control with

1361
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:08.64
a team.

1362
01:14:08.64 --> 01:14:13.44
There's a strong element of chance in all this stuff.

1363
01:14:13.44 --> 01:14:16.76
That's why the best thing you can do is get to a team deal.

1364
01:14:16.76 --> 01:14:17.76
Good job.

1365
01:14:17.76 --> 01:14:18.76
Do the best you can.

1366
01:14:18.76 --> 01:14:19.76
Keep going on deployment.

1367
01:14:19.76 --> 01:14:22.24
And hopefully you get in the right place at the right time.

1368
01:14:22.24 --> 01:14:27.36
The better you do, the better reputation you have, the better chance you will have.

1369
01:14:27.36 --> 01:14:30.56
But it's still only a chance.

1370
01:14:30.56 --> 01:14:34.08
So did you do a full six months in the Pacific?

1371
01:14:34.08 --> 01:14:35.92
It was nine months, oh dang.

1372
01:14:35.92 --> 01:14:42.40
Nine months in the Pacific staged at a gwam, doing a lot of exercises with various countries.

1373
01:14:42.40 --> 01:14:50.84
I mean, you got to do some cool training, which for me was actually new training, especially

1374
01:14:50.84 --> 01:14:57.76
in terms of urban combat and movement through houses and amongst structures.

1375
01:14:57.76 --> 01:15:01.20
So that was something I hadn't been exposed to because I hadn't done the work up.

1376
01:15:01.20 --> 01:15:05.84
So getting to do that with a platoon with Simunition and this kind of thing was really

1377
01:15:05.84 --> 01:15:08.04
good training, I thought.

1378
01:15:08.04 --> 01:15:10.16
So you get done with that deployment.

1379
01:15:10.16 --> 01:15:12.16
Now you get put as an assistant platoon.

1380
01:15:12.16 --> 01:15:13.16
Correct.

1381
01:15:13.16 --> 01:15:14.16
Yes.

1382
01:15:14.16 --> 01:15:18.28
So this is now 2004 going to be deploying 2005.

1383
01:15:18.28 --> 01:15:20.68
A system platoon commander same team.

1384
01:15:20.68 --> 01:15:23.20
And how's this?

1385
01:15:23.20 --> 01:15:24.20
Yep.

1386
01:15:24.20 --> 01:15:27.72
This is an impotune commander, I'm still a new guy.

1387
01:15:27.72 --> 01:15:31.48
You're in this position as a junior officer in my situation, not being prior and listed

1388
01:15:31.48 --> 01:15:38.20
like you were that you're in terms of not only age but experience in the teams.

1389
01:15:38.20 --> 01:15:45.80
You're just outranked, even though maybe technically on the uniform, there's a rank.

1390
01:15:45.80 --> 01:15:50.68
So it's a difficult position to navigate sometimes.

1391
01:15:50.68 --> 01:15:57.04
I think you want to go into this with some humility with asking questions.

1392
01:15:57.04 --> 01:16:02.76
I found that junior officers in the team sometimes, and I think I can put myself in this

1393
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:08.64
category, try to cover up some of their insecurities, not knowing things, not having

1394
01:16:08.64 --> 01:16:11.40
the experience by acting as if they do.

1395
01:16:11.40 --> 01:16:12.40
No.

1396
01:16:12.40 --> 01:16:18.24
That's in retrospect, you can see, you know that people can see through this, but at the

1397
01:16:18.24 --> 01:16:21.32
time you don't necessarily realize that.

1398
01:16:21.32 --> 01:16:29.76
And so maybe you're reluctant to ask advice or ask someone's opinion, but I actually learned

1399
01:16:29.76 --> 01:16:34.56
that this is a wonderful opportunity to show someone that you value their opinion.

1400
01:16:34.56 --> 01:16:41.60
You ask, hey, in the locker room where the cages are, how you set them up your kid.

1401
01:16:41.60 --> 01:16:42.60
Just pick their brain.

1402
01:16:42.60 --> 01:16:47.92
I mean, this is a good thing for anybody in your organization, when you're new, is ask

1403
01:16:47.92 --> 01:16:50.24
the people who know what's going on.

1404
01:16:50.24 --> 01:16:51.24
What do you recommend?

1405
01:16:51.24 --> 01:16:57.48
And this creates a sense of buy-in, I think, the fact that you value their opinion, that's

1406
01:16:57.48 --> 01:16:58.48
useful.

1407
01:16:58.48 --> 01:17:05.08
So I tried to approach it from a position of humility, but as an assistant-putin commander,

1408
01:17:05.08 --> 01:17:10.60
your primary responsibilities are learn tactics, learn small unit leadership, and then

1409
01:17:10.60 --> 01:17:13.76
do administrative functions for the platoon and support the platoon commander.

1410
01:17:13.76 --> 01:17:14.76
Yeah.

1411
01:17:14.76 --> 01:17:17.88
I mean, even though I was a priori-listed guy, I mean, I still would ask.

1412
01:17:17.88 --> 01:17:22.40
I was like, the team, like the guys, hey, how do you think we should do this?

1413
01:17:22.40 --> 01:17:23.68
What do you think we should do?

1414
01:17:23.68 --> 01:17:24.68
Where should we insert?

1415
01:17:24.68 --> 01:17:26.40
What do you think about this platform over here?

1416
01:17:26.40 --> 01:17:31.32
I would always do that, even if even when I was the more experienced, and sometimes even

1417
01:17:31.32 --> 01:17:35.72
the most experienced, and I learned that from one of my platoon commanders who was a priori-listed

1418
01:17:35.72 --> 01:17:39.36
guy who had more experienced than any of us, who asked us, hey, what do you think, how

1419
01:17:39.36 --> 01:17:40.64
do you think we should do this?

1420
01:17:40.64 --> 01:17:46.60
And that's, you know, I got to just steal his leadership techniques for when I was put

1421
01:17:46.60 --> 01:17:47.60
in charge.

1422
01:17:47.60 --> 01:17:52.000
But I always give that advice, you know, if you, there's no sense in acting like you

1423
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.88
know what you're doing, because everybody, not only do they see through it, but they

1424
01:17:55.88 --> 01:17:56.88
don't expect you to know everything.

1425
01:17:56.88 --> 01:17:59.16
They're like, hey, you've been here for three months, bro.

1426
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:02.84
We don't expect you to know how to run this drill or how to plan for this mission.

1427
01:18:02.84 --> 01:18:03.84
It's okay.

1428
01:18:03.84 --> 01:18:09.12
We do, and we can all work together to figure this out.

1429
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:13.32
Any standout memories from that work up getting ready to deploy?

1430
01:18:13.32 --> 01:18:23.56
You know, my memories are of the people, and in particular, too, who are no longer here,

1431
01:18:23.56 --> 01:18:29.72
and that's just something that I'll always take away from that platoon.

1432
01:18:29.72 --> 01:18:42.52
One was killed in the extortion helicopter crash in another on an operation a few years ago.

1433
01:18:42.52 --> 01:18:43.52
So that's, that's tough.

1434
01:18:43.52 --> 01:18:49.96
I, you know, I really just, I think about those guys a lot.

1435
01:18:49.96 --> 01:18:58.000
I would say one of my leadership failures in this phase was along the lines of being in

1436
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.64
that position of your younger.

1437
01:19:00.64 --> 01:19:02.20
You don't have as much experience.

1438
01:19:02.20 --> 01:19:06.28
You're falling into wanting to be one of the, one of the guys, one of the, you know,

1439
01:19:06.28 --> 01:19:07.28
buddies.

1440
01:19:07.28 --> 01:19:11.80
And, and I, I would say, you know, this is probably something that everybody deals with

1441
01:19:11.80 --> 01:19:16.76
in, in, in the junior officer ranks of the teams.

1442
01:19:16.76 --> 01:19:18.40
You want to be liked.

1443
01:19:18.40 --> 01:19:22.04
You want to be, buddies, you know, going out in this kind of thing with the guys.

1444
01:19:22.04 --> 01:19:23.92
And I, you know, I did that.

1445
01:19:23.92 --> 01:19:32.48
And I don't have any regrets, but I think, for me, one of the hardest, I think, hardest

1446
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:35.72
positions I could have put myself was to be able to make a decision that's, that may

1447
01:19:35.72 --> 01:19:37.44
be right, but not popular.

1448
01:19:37.44 --> 01:19:39.32
Now I wasn't the platoon commander.

1449
01:19:39.32 --> 01:19:44.48
But as an A O I C, it's pretty easy to get into that situation of like, okay, you're

1450
01:19:44.48 --> 01:19:49.16
supposed to support the platoon commander, but yet you are buddies with the guys.

1451
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:52.84
It can be sort of like, in between a rock and a hard place, kind of a situation.

1452
01:19:52.84 --> 01:19:56.16
I think that was a leadership takeaway that I have from that, that platoon.

1453
01:19:56.16 --> 01:19:59.72
And we ended up deploying to the Pacific again.

1454
01:19:59.72 --> 01:20:08.000
This was more directly located in one specific A, A, O. And it was doing foreign internal

1455
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.80
defense with post nation forces.

1456
01:20:10.80 --> 01:20:14.64
And we were dispersed, kind of in a satellite model.

1457
01:20:14.64 --> 01:20:16.40
And it was a long deployment.

1458
01:20:16.40 --> 01:20:18.28
There's definitely some leadership challenges.

1459
01:20:18.28 --> 01:20:22.20
Guys in the platoon, they want to go to Iraq, they want to go to Afghanistan at this

1460
01:20:22.20 --> 01:20:23.48
point.

1461
01:20:23.48 --> 01:20:27.24
But we're on this deployment to the Pacific theater.

1462
01:20:27.24 --> 01:20:31.12
And so yeah, there's some leadership challenges for sure in that environment.

1463
01:20:31.12 --> 01:20:37.48
Yeah, and for a while, the seal teams was rotating like so you do have your deployment

1464
01:20:37.48 --> 01:20:42.16
in the Pacific and then go into Iraq or Afghanistan for another three months.

1465
01:20:42.16 --> 01:20:45.40
But eventually people said, that's not a good movie there.

1466
01:20:45.40 --> 01:20:46.24
And it really isn't.

1467
01:20:46.24 --> 01:20:50.32
I mean, it really just doesn't make.

1468
01:20:50.32 --> 01:20:56.000
It's like the fair fairy comes up with those kind of ideas because it's more fair to get.

1469
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.40
And you know, you feel you feel it.

1470
01:20:58.40 --> 01:21:02.20
You know, you're like, well, this guy, these guys want to go get in the fight.

1471
01:21:02.20 --> 01:21:03.92
So that seems like the fair thing to do.

1472
01:21:03.92 --> 01:21:08.08
But unfortunately, it's the fair fairy doesn't always have the best ideas, even though

1473
01:21:08.08 --> 01:21:09.84
it seems fair, it's not smart.

1474
01:21:09.84 --> 01:21:10.84
Yeah.

1475
01:21:10.84 --> 01:21:17.44
And the argument is, well, okay, six months is too long to be in combat so we can relieve

1476
01:21:17.44 --> 01:21:22.000
in place and the people who really want to go to, you know, but then you're bringing in

1477
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
people that don't have AO expertise.

1478
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.04
And it's just, yeah, I agree.

1479
01:21:27.04 --> 01:21:31.44
So at this point now, I've done two deployments as a junior officer.

1480
01:21:31.44 --> 01:21:38.44
I have not been to Iraq or Afghanistan and people who I've gone through Buds with at this

1481
01:21:38.44 --> 01:21:47.16
point have started deploying to Iraq or OEF in Afghanistan and they're going on combat operations.

1482
01:21:47.16 --> 01:21:51.20
You know, the stuff that we trained, we trained to do all of it.

1483
01:21:51.20 --> 01:21:59.92
But what really pushes your training in the ultimate test of your training applied overseas

1484
01:21:59.92 --> 01:22:04.88
is what you could be doing in the state of things at that time was what you could be doing

1485
01:22:04.88 --> 01:22:06.12
in Iraq or Afghanistan.

1486
01:22:06.12 --> 01:22:12.88
And so, yeah, I was feeling, oh, to be honest, a bit frustrated because as a junior officer,

1487
01:22:12.88 --> 01:22:19.20
you're going to get your AOIC deployment, your OIC deployment, in platoons.

1488
01:22:19.20 --> 01:22:22.40
And if you're either in a platoon or you're not.

1489
01:22:22.40 --> 01:22:28.92
And I've, when I first showed up at the team and I'm not in a platoon, that sucks.

1490
01:22:28.92 --> 01:22:31.36
You're in a platoon or you're not.

1491
01:22:31.36 --> 01:22:34.92
And you're going to get two platoons.

1492
01:22:34.92 --> 01:22:42.16
And then maybe a task in it, commander tour, but okay, certainly not as quite as operational.

1493
01:22:42.16 --> 01:22:45.68
So yeah, I got one more to go.

1494
01:22:45.68 --> 01:22:48.40
And yeah, I was a little bit frustrated to be honest.

1495
01:22:48.40 --> 01:22:51.64
And then now I don't want to come across as bitter.

1496
01:22:51.64 --> 01:22:54.76
I'm just trying to be honest about how I felt at the time.

1497
01:22:54.76 --> 01:23:01.48
Well, what kind of human beings try and go through all this shit to go to the seal teams?

1498
01:23:01.48 --> 01:23:03.88
Guys that want to go to war.

1499
01:23:03.88 --> 01:23:07.56
So when you do it nine months of deployment with no war and then you now you go in a six

1500
01:23:07.56 --> 01:23:11.24
month of deployment, no war and you know you've got limited opportunities in the rest

1501
01:23:11.24 --> 01:23:19.44
of your career, it's going to be, I mean, I wouldn't want to type a person that's like,

1502
01:23:19.44 --> 01:23:21.20
I'm always happy I wasn't going to war.

1503
01:23:21.20 --> 01:23:23.28
That's not the kind of guy you would want in the seal teams.

1504
01:23:23.28 --> 01:23:30.72
I talk to firefighters and I talk to them and see, not that you're necessarily wanting

1505
01:23:30.72 --> 01:23:33.52
there to be fire people's lives to be a risk.

1506
01:23:33.52 --> 01:23:38.20
But given that there is one, you want to be the one who responds.

1507
01:23:38.20 --> 01:23:44.36
And if you're not around people that feel that way, that's a problem.

1508
01:23:44.36 --> 01:23:50.000
And I was proud to be around a group of people that buy and large want to go respond to

1509
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.48
that fire.

1510
01:23:51.48 --> 01:23:52.64
So to speak in the teams.

1511
01:23:52.64 --> 01:23:58.84
Yeah, and I think they eventually got to a point where like, hey, if a guy had just gone

1512
01:23:58.84 --> 01:24:02.80
to Iraq or Afghanistan and maybe he'd gone twice in a row and now they put him in a

1513
01:24:02.80 --> 01:24:07.96
puttune where he's not going to go and it was a little, it did get more fair as time went

1514
01:24:07.96 --> 01:24:08.96
on.

1515
01:24:08.96 --> 01:24:09.96
But this was only what?

1516
01:24:09.96 --> 01:24:10.96
This was 2005.

1517
01:24:10.96 --> 01:24:14.96
So it was like, you know, it's a tough one.

1518
01:24:14.96 --> 01:24:20.92
Yeah, I come back from that deployment in 2006 and then I did a little bit of an overseas

1519
01:24:20.92 --> 01:24:24.000
augmentation in Afghanistan and I did get to go there.

1520
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.16
Got to see some of the country, some of the area of operations.

1521
01:24:27.16 --> 01:24:31.20
I came back from that and then I did what's called a disassociated tour.

1522
01:24:31.20 --> 01:24:32.64
So you're not in a puttune.

1523
01:24:32.64 --> 01:24:37.48
Again, in my estimation, you're either in a puttune or you're not.

1524
01:24:37.48 --> 01:24:41.48
And if you're one of the people who's not, it's a distinct feeling.

1525
01:24:41.48 --> 01:24:42.68
There's nothing like being in a puttune.

1526
01:24:42.68 --> 01:24:45.24
It's one of the, I mean, I would do that job for 20 years.

1527
01:24:45.24 --> 01:24:47.28
If I could.

1528
01:24:47.28 --> 01:24:53.68
But so I'm a disassociated tour but supporting puttunes at the team on a deployment

1529
01:24:53.68 --> 01:24:54.68
that.

1530
01:24:54.68 --> 01:24:55.68
So you did another deployment.

1531
01:24:55.68 --> 01:24:59.64
Another deployment of we, but at least you, so you've been to Afghanistan.

1532
01:24:59.64 --> 01:25:04.56
And now you come back, you're doing a disassociated tour of some job where you're supporting

1533
01:25:04.56 --> 01:25:05.56
the teams.

1534
01:25:05.56 --> 01:25:08.56
We're doing some kind of like recon elements, I think.

1535
01:25:08.56 --> 01:25:11.80
Generally speaking, yeah, intelligence collection and this kind of thing.

1536
01:25:11.80 --> 01:25:14.16
So it was definitely a leadership.

1537
01:25:14.16 --> 01:25:17.56
So I'm, I'm a officer in charge.

1538
01:25:17.56 --> 01:25:20.76
And you're in charge of operational stuff that's going to help.

1539
01:25:20.76 --> 01:25:21.76
Yeah, absolutely.

1540
01:25:21.76 --> 01:25:22.76
Where did you deploy to?

1541
01:25:22.76 --> 01:25:23.76
To Iraq.

1542
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:24.76
Okay.

1543
01:25:24.76 --> 01:25:25.76
So that's also nice.

1544
01:25:25.76 --> 01:25:26.76
Yeah.

1545
01:25:26.76 --> 01:25:28.48
And I got to see the area.

1546
01:25:28.48 --> 01:25:31.92
I did get to go out on some operations.

1547
01:25:31.92 --> 01:25:35.76
But again, I'm not in the puttune.

1548
01:25:35.76 --> 01:25:41.08
So it was, it was, it's just, you can chalk it up to experience.

1549
01:25:41.08 --> 01:25:47.68
But again, I just can't help but think, okay, I don't have combat experience.

1550
01:25:47.68 --> 01:25:52.96
And you know this, combat experience is the market of respect in the teams.

1551
01:25:52.96 --> 01:25:55.92
Now I'm, that deployment goes to 2008.

1552
01:25:55.92 --> 01:25:59.56
I've been in five years with a try-to.

1553
01:25:59.56 --> 01:26:00.80
Six years into my career.

1554
01:26:00.80 --> 01:26:04.48
And I don't have combat experience and it's not my fault.

1555
01:26:04.48 --> 01:26:11.04
But this is something I felt like I had been training for and I just felt.

1556
01:26:11.04 --> 01:26:12.04
And secure about it.

1557
01:26:12.04 --> 01:26:14.000
Where were you when you and Iraq?

1558
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Where'd you go?

1559
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.64
We're in the Western provinces there.

1560
01:26:16.64 --> 01:26:17.64
Yeah.

1561
01:26:17.64 --> 01:26:19.64
So near where you were in, in Ramadi.

1562
01:26:19.64 --> 01:26:24.28
And we had, various, I think it was more like an outstation model at this point.

1563
01:26:24.28 --> 01:26:26.04
Did you at least go like on some ops?

1564
01:26:26.04 --> 01:26:27.04
Oh yeah.

1565
01:26:27.04 --> 01:26:28.04
Yeah, yeah.

1566
01:26:28.04 --> 01:26:29.04
Yeah, yeah.

1567
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:30.04
But no shots fired.

1568
01:26:30.04 --> 01:26:31.04
I mean, I don't consider that combat.

1569
01:26:31.04 --> 01:26:37.60
Not that, not that, I mean, some good operation, there may not be shots fired.

1570
01:26:37.60 --> 01:26:41.24
It's just, I didn't have, and I wasn't in a leadership position.

1571
01:26:41.24 --> 01:26:42.24
Yeah.

1572
01:26:42.24 --> 01:26:43.24
Yeah.

1573
01:26:43.24 --> 01:26:44.24
So, okay.

1574
01:26:44.24 --> 01:26:45.24
So you come back from that deployment.

1575
01:26:45.24 --> 01:26:46.24
Yes.

1576
01:26:46.24 --> 01:26:49.84
So now you're one, two, three, three deployments deep.

1577
01:26:49.84 --> 01:26:50.84
Yep.

1578
01:26:50.84 --> 01:26:53.04
In an augmentation and I, how long was that augment?

1579
01:26:53.04 --> 01:26:54.04
It was just two months.

1580
01:26:54.04 --> 01:26:55.04
Yeah.

1581
01:26:55.04 --> 01:26:57.52
And I got to do, I got to go to an outstation there.

1582
01:26:57.52 --> 01:26:58.76
And that was, that was great.

1583
01:26:58.76 --> 01:27:01.72
But I've now passed my service requirement.

1584
01:27:01.72 --> 01:27:03.36
I could get out.

1585
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:06.72
You know, after graduating from the Nail Academy, you do five years.

1586
01:27:06.72 --> 01:27:07.72
You can punch.

1587
01:27:07.72 --> 01:27:12.40
That would just seem like so weak to me.

1588
01:27:12.40 --> 01:27:15.24
Yeah, I honestly, I didn't even think about that to be honest.

1589
01:27:15.24 --> 01:27:18.48
But as I look back, I'm, wow, yeah, I could, after that deployment, I could have just

1590
01:27:18.48 --> 01:27:19.48
gotten out.

1591
01:27:19.48 --> 01:27:22.88
And then things would have been different.

1592
01:27:22.88 --> 01:27:26.72
Well, it's really hard, like we're talking about.

1593
01:27:26.72 --> 01:27:29.44
It's really hard to look at your career and be like, okay, I'm just going to get

1594
01:27:29.44 --> 01:27:30.44
out now.

1595
01:27:30.44 --> 01:27:34.40
When you know you got friends that are fighting, you know that you have more to offer.

1596
01:27:34.40 --> 01:27:36.60
So you're not getting out.

1597
01:27:36.60 --> 01:27:42.92
No, and the one job that I have to do is put to a commander.

1598
01:27:42.92 --> 01:27:48.68
In my opinion, if you don't do that, that's for me where I was in my mind, I don't do

1599
01:27:48.68 --> 01:27:49.68
that job.

1600
01:27:49.68 --> 01:27:52.20
I'm failing myself and everything that I've been through.

1601
01:27:52.20 --> 01:27:56.68
That's the one critical tour that I'm going to do.

1602
01:27:56.68 --> 01:27:57.68
Right.

1603
01:27:57.68 --> 01:27:59.52
And so you go back to team one to do that.

1604
01:27:59.52 --> 01:28:00.52
Yeah.

1605
01:28:00.52 --> 01:28:04.52
So you get back to team one now you're a particular.

1606
01:28:04.52 --> 01:28:05.52
Correct.

1607
01:28:05.52 --> 01:28:11.80
And this is now, and I had been an officer in charge of the previous element.

1608
01:28:11.80 --> 01:28:13.80
But for me, this was a very special assignment.

1609
01:28:13.80 --> 01:28:20.64
I really was excited just to be a platoon leader in a seal platoon.

1610
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:26.60
Just felt like seven, eight, nine years of, like coming down to this two-year assignment.

1611
01:28:26.60 --> 01:28:31.16
And you actually have some decent experience for being a platoon commander.

1612
01:28:31.16 --> 01:28:35.96
I mean, you've done multiple deployments overseas.

1613
01:28:35.96 --> 01:28:36.96
You're doing all right.

1614
01:28:36.96 --> 01:28:40.60
This isn't like a guy that, like sometimes you get a lateral transfer that has like what

1615
01:28:40.60 --> 01:28:41.60
they did.

1616
01:28:41.60 --> 01:28:43.72
Sometimes they do no deployments.

1617
01:28:43.72 --> 01:28:47.72
Sometimes a lateral transfer is really senior and they just get put into an OIC position.

1618
01:28:47.72 --> 01:28:49.40
They have no experience.

1619
01:28:49.40 --> 01:28:52.32
So you've been in the teams the whole time.

1620
01:28:52.32 --> 01:28:55.04
And you've done multiple deployments.

1621
01:28:55.04 --> 01:28:58.92
So you're feeling, you must've been feeling pretty good about being a platoon commander.

1622
01:28:58.92 --> 01:28:59.92
Absolutely.

1623
01:28:59.92 --> 01:29:04.88
Volunteer, I'm the person who's going to volunteer to go to the augmentation.

1624
01:29:04.88 --> 01:29:05.88
I didn't need to do that.

1625
01:29:05.88 --> 01:29:06.88
And that was after a deployment.

1626
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:08.88
You know, I pretty quickly after.

1627
01:29:08.88 --> 01:29:09.88
I wanted to go.

1628
01:29:09.88 --> 01:29:11.88
I wanted to get the experience.

1629
01:29:11.88 --> 01:29:14.88
Would you go through an 18-month platoon workup cycle?

1630
01:29:14.88 --> 01:29:16.84
And your deployment is where your deployment is.

1631
01:29:16.84 --> 01:29:23.12
And you know, so six years may seem like a long time, but it's actually not a lot of different

1632
01:29:23.12 --> 01:29:24.12
assignments.

1633
01:29:24.12 --> 01:29:26.28
It's only three assignments really within that time.

1634
01:29:26.28 --> 01:29:28.60
And what's going on with your family this whole time?

1635
01:29:28.60 --> 01:29:33.04
Like you've been gone and what's happening with the family.

1636
01:29:33.04 --> 01:29:35.84
So at this point, it's just my mom and sister.

1637
01:29:35.84 --> 01:29:39.88
My sister now is she's in college in Kansas.

1638
01:29:39.88 --> 01:29:44.32
My mother remarried after my father died in 1999.

1639
01:29:44.32 --> 01:29:46.12
I was at the Naval Academy.

1640
01:29:46.12 --> 01:29:49.80
And hopefully, how do we skip over that?

1641
01:29:49.80 --> 01:29:52.32
What happened to your dad when you were at the Naval Academy?

1642
01:29:52.32 --> 01:29:56.28
Well, he was out on a bike ride one day and was hit by a car.

1643
01:29:56.28 --> 01:29:59.24
And this just happened out of the blue.

1644
01:29:59.24 --> 01:30:02.60
I had been training for the triathlon team.

1645
01:30:02.60 --> 01:30:06.20
And I think he had kind of taken a cycling.

1646
01:30:06.20 --> 01:30:11.04
But it was one of these mornings that the Naval Academy were just getting ready to go to

1647
01:30:11.04 --> 01:30:12.04
class.

1648
01:30:12.04 --> 01:30:17.04
And I remember one of the upper class became by, and I was, I'm a sophomore at this

1649
01:30:17.04 --> 01:30:18.04
point.

1650
01:30:18.04 --> 01:30:22.20
And it's pretty, or I had just been home in Kansas because over the summer.

1651
01:30:22.20 --> 01:30:27.92
And he said, the company officer wants you to see you.

1652
01:30:27.92 --> 01:30:28.92
What did I do?

1653
01:30:28.92 --> 01:30:33.000
There's probably, I'm sure there was something I had done in the recent memory that

1654
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.72
would leave me to believe, like, oh, man, I got caught.

1655
01:30:35.72 --> 01:30:38.36
So I go in there and he told me the news.

1656
01:30:38.36 --> 01:30:41.76
And it just was like the floor dropped out from under me.

1657
01:30:41.76 --> 01:30:46.72
We had a, the company senior in Lester was a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant.

1658
01:30:46.72 --> 01:30:48.96
And he knew he had met my father.

1659
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:53.88
Because at the end of pleaps summer, the parents get to come and see how things were,

1660
01:30:53.88 --> 01:30:55.20
you know, you graduated pleaps summer.

1661
01:30:55.20 --> 01:30:58.68
And so they talked about the Marine Corps.

1662
01:30:58.68 --> 01:31:00.000
And this gun he was awesome.

1663
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.28
And he, he was very supportive.

1664
01:31:03.28 --> 01:31:06.56
I got this happened on a Thursday.

1665
01:31:06.56 --> 01:31:14.52
And the Naval Academy, and all of its generosity, told me, you can go home on emergency

1666
01:31:14.52 --> 01:31:17.72
leave, you need to be back Thursday.

1667
01:31:17.72 --> 01:31:21.28
The following week, one week.

1668
01:31:21.28 --> 01:31:24.04
That still pisses me off.

1669
01:31:24.04 --> 01:31:30.20
But I went home in the funeral and then came back and was in class a week later.

1670
01:31:30.20 --> 01:31:35.32
And yeah, that's, so my mom ended up remarrying.

1671
01:31:35.32 --> 01:31:37.16
I ended up being overseas when that happened.

1672
01:31:37.16 --> 01:31:43.04
My sister is in nursing school in Ecanza's.

1673
01:31:43.04 --> 01:31:47.68
And I'm single, ready to deploy, and ready to be a platoon commander.

1674
01:31:47.68 --> 01:31:48.68
In 2008.

1675
01:31:48.68 --> 01:31:53.28
So you're, you're in a platoon and going through work up.

1676
01:31:53.28 --> 01:31:56.08
This is probably when I met you for the first time when you're working.

1677
01:31:56.08 --> 01:31:57.08
Yes, you work up.

1678
01:31:57.08 --> 01:31:58.92
You were training detachment, OIC.

1679
01:31:58.92 --> 01:32:00.76
Yeah, we have good times.

1680
01:32:00.76 --> 01:32:06.24
Yeah, and I first of all, I want to thank you for the training, specifically, Land

1681
01:32:06.24 --> 01:32:07.24
Warfare.

1682
01:32:07.24 --> 01:32:10.56
You know, I didn't get to stay on that deployment very long.

1683
01:32:10.56 --> 01:32:15.92
But I'm of the firm opinion that training should be very difficult.

1684
01:32:15.92 --> 01:32:18.92
And I think you really stepped it up.

1685
01:32:18.92 --> 01:32:22.76
And so that probably saved lives.

1686
01:32:22.76 --> 01:32:28.28
Jason Gardner, who was the, I guess he was the senior and listed guy when you guys were

1687
01:32:28.28 --> 01:32:29.52
out there when you got hit.

1688
01:32:29.52 --> 01:32:34.92
But he, he, he talks, he talked to me about it and like how everything went down and

1689
01:32:34.92 --> 01:32:37.76
definitely, you know, his whole deployment.

1690
01:32:37.76 --> 01:32:45.40
He has multiple stories where, you know, there was maneuver elements that they were able

1691
01:32:45.40 --> 01:32:50.68
to act on and able to stop and blew on blues that could have easily happened that they

1692
01:32:50.68 --> 01:32:53.56
didn't happen because they'd been through training that was really hard.

1693
01:32:53.56 --> 01:32:58.84
So yeah, I was definitely my goal was to make the training hard so that guys were ready

1694
01:32:58.84 --> 01:33:00.92
for combat.

1695
01:33:00.92 --> 01:33:04.76
And, you know, it was, it was awesome to see.

1696
01:33:04.76 --> 01:33:11.36
It was awesome to be able to watch guys develop and get really good and understand what

1697
01:33:11.36 --> 01:33:12.68
their job was.

1698
01:33:12.68 --> 01:33:17.56
It was a really steep learning curve, but it was also like a learning curve that was steep,

1699
01:33:17.56 --> 01:33:21.84
but also had like really nice steps on it where you, you know, this training operation,

1700
01:33:21.84 --> 01:33:24.64
you'd learn this thing and then they'd figure this other thing out and then they'd

1701
01:33:24.64 --> 01:33:25.64
do this other thing.

1702
01:33:25.64 --> 01:33:28.56
We'd put them in a different scenario and, and then you've got them in Mount and they're

1703
01:33:28.56 --> 01:33:30.40
learning, you know, other steps.

1704
01:33:30.40 --> 01:33:36.04
So by the time guys were getting done, they were really, really competent leaders and it

1705
01:33:36.04 --> 01:33:37.04
was awesome to see.

1706
01:33:37.04 --> 01:33:42.28
I remember you, you broke things down in a way that made sense in its simplicity.

1707
01:33:42.28 --> 01:33:46.84
I remember one time you were, I think I don't know if we were one on one, but it was a very close

1708
01:33:46.84 --> 01:33:52.08
conversation and you were just saying, listen, either you're online or you're in an

1709
01:33:52.08 --> 01:33:53.08
out.

1710
01:33:53.08 --> 01:33:55.40
I just, I think it was one on one.

1711
01:33:55.40 --> 01:33:58.36
And it just, the way you said it just really hit on me.

1712
01:33:58.36 --> 01:33:59.36
Yeah, okay.

1713
01:33:59.36 --> 01:34:04.16
And then I've, I've fouled it away and that was a very valuable lesson for me.

1714
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:05.16
And it's a simple one.

1715
01:34:05.16 --> 01:34:10.36
It's, it's pretty simple, but sometimes you know, in the chaos, you just, you just get overwhelmed

1716
01:34:10.36 --> 01:34:17.84
and then, and then just to prioritize and execute, that's a really important rule that, you

1717
01:34:17.84 --> 01:34:25.12
know, there could be, I can see situations in training environments or in combat where

1718
01:34:25.12 --> 01:34:30.28
you're getting overwhelmed by either too much going on or you're actually overwhelmed

1719
01:34:30.28 --> 01:34:35.08
because there's, there's actually no seemingly viable course of action.

1720
01:34:35.08 --> 01:34:40.08
I think those are two different situations, but in the, the other, the one where, there's

1721
01:34:40.08 --> 01:34:44.92
just so much going on, okay, you know, prioritize and execute and pick the most important

1722
01:34:44.92 --> 01:34:50.24
thing or either delegated or act upon it yourself with the other situation.

1723
01:34:50.24 --> 01:34:54.28
Yeah, there's, it just doesn't seem like there's any viable course of action.

1724
01:34:54.28 --> 01:34:56.76
What can we even do to make this situation better?

1725
01:34:56.76 --> 01:34:58.72
Just realize, there's always something you can do.

1726
01:34:58.72 --> 01:35:01.04
Oh, there's never out of the fight.

1727
01:35:01.04 --> 01:35:05.56
Even if you're going to continue doing what you're currently doing, that's an active

1728
01:35:05.56 --> 01:35:07.56
choice, not a passive choice.

1729
01:35:07.56 --> 01:35:08.56
And there's a difference there.

1730
01:35:08.56 --> 01:35:11.64
Oh, yeah, there's a big difference.

1731
01:35:11.64 --> 01:35:15.12
As you're going through that workup, how was like the relationships with your, with your

1732
01:35:15.12 --> 01:35:16.84
platoon chief with your LPO?

1733
01:35:16.84 --> 01:35:21.08
Did you guys have a good solid, you know, platoon from your perspective?

1734
01:35:21.08 --> 01:35:22.36
Yeah, we did.

1735
01:35:22.36 --> 01:35:26.92
And I think, I think that's why our platoon tasking, it was selected to go to Afghanistan

1736
01:35:26.92 --> 01:35:28.92
because I think we did well.

1737
01:35:28.92 --> 01:35:33.48
And when I say that platoons and tasking, it's not always to get the choose where they

1738
01:35:33.48 --> 01:35:37.24
deploy, but there is a little bit of selection process going on within the team.

1739
01:35:37.24 --> 01:35:41.80
And so I think I took it as a compliment that we were going to go on this deployment to

1740
01:35:41.80 --> 01:35:42.80
Afghanistan.

1741
01:35:42.80 --> 01:35:46.84
And the West Coast teams had not been deploying to that AO for a while.

1742
01:35:46.84 --> 01:35:49.40
So it was going to be new.

1743
01:35:49.40 --> 01:35:51.24
And we're going to be going to Iraq this time.

1744
01:35:51.24 --> 01:35:56.24
And so we knew that the team, the platoon, that we would be replacing, were getting into

1745
01:35:56.24 --> 01:35:57.24
it.

1746
01:35:57.24 --> 01:35:58.64
My platoon chief was experienced.

1747
01:35:58.64 --> 01:36:03.88
We had a prior-and-listed assistant officer in charge was really, really great.

1748
01:36:03.88 --> 01:36:11.68
And one of the things I wanted to approach this position with in my mind was this leadership

1749
01:36:11.68 --> 01:36:17.80
position was, if through the workup, I can ask the opinion of the enlisted members of the

1750
01:36:17.80 --> 01:36:23.000
platoon and really show that I value their advice that that is going to create a sense

1751
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:31.64
of empowerment and buy-in, but also that their value is that their opinion is valued and that

1752
01:36:31.64 --> 01:36:38.56
can create an atmosphere of innovation because you don't want to train fiateen leaders

1753
01:36:38.56 --> 01:36:42.000
to just be responsive to doing what they're told.

1754
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.04
You want them to have initiative.

1755
01:36:45.04 --> 01:36:49.68
And so in order to do that, you know, this is, hey, what do you think about this?

1756
01:36:49.68 --> 01:36:50.68
What do you think about this?

1757
01:36:50.68 --> 01:36:51.68
Just in the day-to-day.

1758
01:36:51.68 --> 01:36:57.08
And I hope that that, you know, the ultimate barometer here is the opinion of the people in

1759
01:36:57.08 --> 01:36:58.08
the platoon.

1760
01:36:58.08 --> 01:37:03.68
And the other thing is when you're going through a platoon workup, you're trying to train

1761
01:37:03.68 --> 01:37:08.68
yourself and you're trying to train everybody in their various job, but you also have

1762
01:37:08.68 --> 01:37:11.08
to be training people to be able to step up.

1763
01:37:11.08 --> 01:37:15.56
And that is one of the things, you're going through a training evolution, you have training

1764
01:37:15.56 --> 01:37:21.64
detachment and structures evaluating you on your own leadership and tactical decisions,

1765
01:37:21.64 --> 01:37:27.08
but you need to be able to step aside and say, okay, hey, you got this one.

1766
01:37:27.08 --> 01:37:31.60
It's tough because you're, oh, are people to think I'm just ducking it out because I don't

1767
01:37:31.60 --> 01:37:35.84
want to make a bad call, but you do need to have the ability to do one job above you.

1768
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:40.24
And I think those two things were what I worked on.

1769
01:37:40.24 --> 01:37:46.12
And I think, especially the second one, you know, giving a system platoon commander the

1770
01:37:46.12 --> 01:37:50.80
opportunity to take my position that that in hindsight was the right call.

1771
01:37:50.80 --> 01:37:57.24
For sure. We would, we would do that too. You know, if we had a platoon commander or a platoon

1772
01:37:57.24 --> 01:38:01.48
chief that was really running everything, they'd be the first person we put down in a training

1773
01:38:01.48 --> 01:38:08.16
scenario just to let's see what's going to happen now. Now that we pulled this guy out,

1774
01:38:08.16 --> 01:38:13.84
so you get done with this workup and now it's time to go on deployment. And like you

1775
01:38:13.84 --> 01:38:22.80
said, you had been selected to go to Afghanistan and you end up going on the PDFs, right?

1776
01:38:22.80 --> 01:38:32.68
The predouplement site survey. Yes. You know, we didn't go months in advance. So there

1777
01:38:32.68 --> 01:38:37.76
was, as I recall, there was going out a few months early and then there was going out

1778
01:38:37.76 --> 01:38:43.20
three weeks or so before your platoon. For whatever reason, I, we didn't go a few months

1779
01:38:43.20 --> 01:38:49.84
or I don't know why, but the plan was for some of the key leaders in the task unit to go

1780
01:38:49.84 --> 01:38:54.92
early, three weeks or so early. That's standard procedure. I remember thinking, you know, this

1781
01:38:54.92 --> 01:39:02.12
is, this is just, is what you do. This is a very important deployment for me, given,

1782
01:39:02.12 --> 01:39:06.56
and I remember thinking, you know, if I was only going to get one, if you can only have

1783
01:39:06.56 --> 01:39:10.80
one really good deployment, well, this is the one I would choose. So it just kind of felt

1784
01:39:10.80 --> 01:39:15.76
like things are lining up. Yeah, I'm going into that deployment. Like I said, it was Jason

1785
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:20.88
Gardner and his task unit task unit tried and, and they had, you know, Jason describes

1786
01:39:20.88 --> 01:39:26.04
that as the most kinetic of his deployments. And he'd, a lot of deployments. And so those

1787
01:39:26.04 --> 01:39:31.68
guys were, and you know, I was tracking those guys. I remember I said, I would sign my emails

1788
01:39:31.68 --> 01:39:35.72
back and forth when they would tell me what they were doing. I would sign my emails to them,

1789
01:39:35.72 --> 01:39:41.24
you know, Jaco spiritual advisor to task unit, try to, they got to kick out of that

1790
01:39:41.24 --> 01:39:45.16
him and the task unit commander and stuff. But, you know, we were tracking, they were doing a

1791
01:39:45.16 --> 01:39:52.60
lot of really kinetic operations. And yeah, definitely for the guys on the West Coast getting

1792
01:39:52.60 --> 01:39:59.80
ready to go there at that time. That's a good place to be going because, you know, I rack

1793
01:39:59.80 --> 01:40:08.12
head settled down a lot at this point, you know, kind of after the the debt defender group

1794
01:40:08.12 --> 01:40:13.96
going into Saudar City, you know, Iraq had definitely settled down. So you guys were going to

1795
01:40:15.64 --> 01:40:22.36
the, you know, the best show in town. Yeah. And I felt we were ready. Land warfare in the desert

1796
01:40:22.36 --> 01:40:29.24
of California is pretty similar to the terrain and the geography of southern Afghanistan. And

1797
01:40:29.24 --> 01:40:37.96
we had a hard land warfare training block. We dialed in our training specifically over the, you know,

1798
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:42.44
postwork up phase where you can kind of, you know, we're going to deploy and we're doing a lot of

1799
01:40:43.32 --> 01:40:49.80
operations in training that we're going to mimic, we're mimicking what we felt. We're reading

1800
01:40:49.80 --> 01:40:53.40
in the after action, which we knew these guys were getting into and we knew a specifically how they

1801
01:40:53.40 --> 01:40:56.84
were going to the upper side. So we could tailor the training for that and we had done all that. So we

1802
01:40:56.84 --> 01:41:03.08
were, we were ready ready to go. So you show up on the ground, how long you on the ground for

1803
01:41:03.08 --> 01:41:06.60
before and when you hit the ground, they like, hey, we got one in the hopper right now. We're going to

1804
01:41:06.60 --> 01:41:13.08
rock and roll. Yeah. So some operations are time sensitive. This is one that was not. It was shelved.

1805
01:41:13.08 --> 01:41:21.88
And I think they wanted it, you know, in rightly so, they wanted to expose us to a not only the

1806
01:41:21.88 --> 01:41:26.36
execution of the operation, but the planning process, the relevant players sitting on the briefing,

1807
01:41:26.36 --> 01:41:31.48
and all of this is very valuable. Who we're going to talk to the air crew and all of that. So

1808
01:41:31.48 --> 01:41:36.44
yet, they had one ready for us for the leadership element that had gone early and keeping in my

1809
01:41:36.44 --> 01:41:39.56
most of the platoon and taskings is still back in San Diego at this point.

1810
01:41:41.48 --> 01:41:45.56
So as soon as you show up on the ground, they like, all right, here's what we got in the books.

1811
01:41:45.56 --> 01:41:50.52
We're going to, how long was it before you, from the time you got on the ground,

1812
01:41:50.52 --> 01:41:54.04
do they hand you, like, hey, come, let's give you a brief, a general brief of what's happening.

1813
01:41:54.04 --> 01:41:57.32
Let us give you a concept of operations of what we're about to go do.

1814
01:41:57.32 --> 01:42:03.80
Yeah, I think this is where my memory gets a little fuzzy. I think just given what ended up happening.

1815
01:42:03.80 --> 01:42:07.88
I feel like I was on the ground. Well, certainly no more than 48 hours. Yeah.

1816
01:42:08.76 --> 01:42:14.20
So you show up, you're getting a brief. How many guys from your task unit are there?

1817
01:42:14.20 --> 01:42:23.40
It's like three or four. I'd say six to eight. Six to eight. Yeah. And you guys all have,

1818
01:42:23.40 --> 01:42:28.52
you get assigned probably jobs with, you know, the different sections or the different squads.

1819
01:42:28.52 --> 01:42:33.40
Yes, they have. I was assigned to the platoon leader from one of the two platoons in

1820
01:42:33.40 --> 01:42:41.16
country who you know from your task unit. Yep. Yep. And so we just go through, I remember

1821
01:42:41.16 --> 01:42:45.88
they were planning, but in the final stages, and then I remember sitting on the brief,

1822
01:42:47.32 --> 01:42:52.20
I remember going to the plywood, how it's kidding up. I remember going to the flight line,

1823
01:42:52.20 --> 01:42:58.20
taking the trucks to the flight line. And are you thinking this time, hey, you have a good understanding

1824
01:42:58.20 --> 01:43:02.04
of the operation? You know what we're going to do? You're going to get a good feel for it. Yeah, absolutely.

1825
01:43:02.04 --> 01:43:07.64
And don't let my absence of memory right now, the details of where it happened,

1826
01:43:07.64 --> 01:43:14.20
and affect the impression that I, I just think given what happened, and I don't remember where

1827
01:43:14.20 --> 01:43:18.44
this happened. I don't remember the, I remember the generalities of the operation, of course,

1828
01:43:18.44 --> 01:43:27.24
but the details escape me. What do you remember? I remember being in Canada, I remember going

1829
01:43:27.24 --> 01:43:32.44
for a run, I remember going for a lift, I remember eating, I remember sitting in the briefing,

1830
01:43:32.44 --> 01:43:43.16
I remember going to the plywood hut, I remember sleeping one night. I remember going to the fire pits

1831
01:43:43.16 --> 01:43:53.40
before we launched for a chaplain-led ceremony, a ritual. You know, this is, this is, I think,

1832
01:43:55.32 --> 01:43:59.72
evident of combat. You can, it's like you have bits and pieces of memory, Vax,

1833
01:43:59.72 --> 01:44:04.60
and they can get assembled in different ways. And certainly when I talk about the operation and what

1834
01:44:04.60 --> 01:44:10.28
happened, in order to get the complete picture, you'd have to talk to other people to my impression

1835
01:44:10.84 --> 01:44:17.40
is my own impression. And I fully acknowledge that my memory may be distorted, but there are absolutely

1836
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.20
parts of this that I completely remember. And what is interesting to me, though, is that

1837
01:44:26.20 --> 01:44:35.32
some of this pre-operational occurrences that they, I just don't really remember a lot of it.

1838
01:44:35.32 --> 01:44:41.24
I don't know, I don't know why. Do you remember being on the helos going in? Yes,

1839
01:44:41.24 --> 01:44:46.28
I remember sitting on the helo, you know, it's loud and you're on night vision goggles and

1840
01:44:46.28 --> 01:44:49.64
ones really talk. I mean, you can hear the pilot chatter if you want to be on that frequency. And

1841
01:44:50.20 --> 01:44:54.84
this seems probably about a 45 minute flight. I mean, the general operation was to conduct a

1842
01:44:54.84 --> 01:45:03.64
target assault, a compound, a drug, a bizarre, I think at this time we were getting into the counter

1843
01:45:03.64 --> 01:45:08.12
narcotics, you know, this is a funding source for Taliban. And this is in heavily controlled

1844
01:45:08.12 --> 01:45:15.96
Taliban territory. There's bad dudes in this place. This is it's Taliban, controlled village,

1845
01:45:15.96 --> 01:45:20.68
and there's going to be an assault. I'm not in the assault force element, but I'm going to be in the

1846
01:45:20.68 --> 01:45:26.44
blocking force. And so I'd be shadowing the element that was pre pre assault detached from the

1847
01:45:26.44 --> 01:45:31.000
main assault force. We would, you know, after disembarking the helo, copies, we flip a troll,

1848
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.48
undercover of quiet and darkness middle of the night. Do you remember that? Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1849
01:45:37.48 --> 01:45:42.68
And just going over the plan, you know, it was just to secure the top of a hill in the element

1850
01:45:42.68 --> 01:45:47.40
that I was in. And so you're going to provide kind of like an Overwatch. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah,

1851
01:45:47.40 --> 01:45:51.56
absolutely. As an assault is going down. Yeah. And all this is going to happen. The assault was

1852
01:45:51.56 --> 01:45:59.88
going to happen either right before or right at first light to have a little bit more visual clarity.

1853
01:45:59.88 --> 01:46:04.36
I think that that's really what they wanted to do. So you remember the helo is coming in.

1854
01:46:05.24 --> 01:46:08.04
Yeah. I remember going to the flight line. I remember sitting on the helicopter. I remember that

1855
01:46:08.04 --> 01:46:12.76
getting off the helicopter, you know, they're departing. You wait for, you know, it's quiet again.

1856
01:46:12.76 --> 01:46:19.88
You start foot patrolling. It's kind of, you know, offset. So going through, I remember walking,

1857
01:46:19.88 --> 01:46:25.08
you know, night vision goggles. So it's, I'm sure the technology's improved a lot, but back then it's

1858
01:46:25.08 --> 01:46:31.56
green and black. And I remember, you know, the villages there look like they're from medieval

1859
01:46:31.56 --> 01:46:40.68
times just with the mud brick. Seeing that, it's very quiet or just moving. And then, you know, the

1860
01:46:40.68 --> 01:46:45.000
element that I was a part of detached from the main assault force proceed to the to that hill that

1861
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.20
overlook the target compound. We were going to, we needed to clear and hold that hill top. And there was

1862
01:46:50.20 --> 01:46:55.56
from satellite imagery. We knew there was an old fort up there from back when the Russians were

1863
01:46:55.56 --> 01:47:01.000
in Afghanistan. So we needed to clear and hold that structure. But it was very crumbled at this point

1864
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:08.12
and owned the high ground. And once we had done that, we could set up a commanding over watch position

1865
01:47:08.12 --> 01:47:15.32
with, you know, heavy weapons in this kind of thing. So foot patrolling, we had detached from the

1866
01:47:15.32 --> 01:47:21.16
main assault force element, foot patrolling to that hill. It's going to be about a 15, 20 minute hike

1867
01:47:21.16 --> 01:47:24.36
to get to the top of the hills of fairly, it was not a mountain, but it was a large hill.

1868
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:31.80
I'm going single-fowl working that way up. And being led, we had a Navy explosive ordinance

1869
01:47:31.80 --> 01:47:38.28
to disposal technician up there. And he was sweeping the ground, like, you know, as standard. But

1870
01:47:38.60 --> 01:47:43.88
it was recognized that there's a strong possibility of improvised explosive devices. We'll have

1871
01:47:43.88 --> 01:47:53.88
EOD upfront and have everybody else covering behind. And as we're working our way up, I remember

1872
01:47:53.88 --> 01:48:02.52
I was shadowing with the between commander. And then we kind of had got our way up to the top. And

1873
01:48:04.20 --> 01:48:10.84
I just started moving forward. And I've thought about this a lot. I certainly, you know,

1874
01:48:10.84 --> 01:48:14.68
and I'll talk about it later. But you know, you can armchair quarterback everything. And I'm just

1875
01:48:16.20 --> 01:48:21.72
detaching from who I was shadowing because it didn't seem, at this point, I'm not being

1876
01:48:21.72 --> 01:48:28.12
value-added, but just standing there. And so I was going to take part. And moving forward,

1877
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:35.96
I was going step by step, hold a sudden. The next thing I know I'm on the ground. I want to say

1878
01:48:35.96 --> 01:48:40.52
there was a flash a light. I didn't hear anything. I was on the ground. I didn't know what had happened.

1879
01:48:42.12 --> 01:48:47.88
Now, this is where the experiences of combat can be different from one person to another. And if

1880
01:48:47.88 --> 01:48:51.48
I would, to get a complete picture, you'd have to talk to everybody that was up there.

1881
01:48:51.48 --> 01:48:57.56
All I remember is waking up coming to. I don't know how long I was out. I've talked to people

1882
01:48:57.56 --> 01:49:06.28
on that operation who were down below. They said a massive mushroom cloud went off. And that for

1883
01:49:07.88 --> 01:49:14.44
a long time, nobody was responding on the radio. And that they thought perhaps everybody

1884
01:49:14.44 --> 01:49:23.64
up there was dead. All I remember is coming to. I was disoriented. It occurred to me,

1885
01:49:23.64 --> 01:49:28.68
I must have stepped on a pressure plate. I remember that. And pressure plate below the ground,

1886
01:49:28.68 --> 01:49:34.60
the bomb goes off. I didn't know what the bomb was, but it turns out I'm told

1887
01:49:35.80 --> 01:49:40.92
205 millimeter artillery shells wired together. The second one didn't go off the first one went off

1888
01:49:40.92 --> 01:49:47.80
the order. So I mean, this can destroy everybody up there. Armored vehicle. But the second one

1889
01:49:47.80 --> 01:49:56.84
didn't explode and yeah, low order. But I'm laying there. And I just remember thinking I need my teammates.

1890
01:49:58.12 --> 01:50:04.36
It didn't occur to me that they were dead, but I didn't know if they were alive. I just knew I needed them.

1891
01:50:04.36 --> 01:50:11.000
And I remember reaching up for my push to talk. I remember I got to get man down out of the

1892
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.84
radio. And I reached up for where it should be, but it's not there. I was thinking,

1893
01:50:17.88 --> 01:50:23.80
this is not good. And nothing on my kids, is nothing's worth supposed to be. Only my arms seemed

1894
01:50:23.80 --> 01:50:28.76
to work. I can't see anything. I think my helmet had been blasted off and that vision gone with it.

1895
01:50:28.76 --> 01:50:37.40
I can't move. Only arms are working. And I'm laying there for a second. I just felt

1896
01:50:37.96 --> 01:50:41.96
utterly helpless because I kind of do anything. You want to, you want to be doing something.

1897
01:50:41.96 --> 01:50:48.68
I tried to find my push to talk. It's not there. In my memory, the next thing that happened,

1898
01:50:48.68 --> 01:50:52.68
though, my teammates are on me. None of them had been injured. Bells wrong, yes.

1899
01:50:52.68 --> 01:50:59.88
But nobody in capacity, we could not afford to have one other person in capacity to up there.

1900
01:51:00.44 --> 01:51:05.48
Remote position elevated, I mean, just not a good situation to even have one person down, but two,

1901
01:51:06.44 --> 01:51:12.44
really not. I mean, just, if not impossible to deal with. We had a medic up there, of course.

1902
01:51:13.24 --> 01:51:19.16
Navy, exposed ordinance disposal is trying to just protect us at this point digging for other,

1903
01:51:19.16 --> 01:51:23.64
sweeping and digging for other. Finding additional IDs, I'm told up there. There were several.

1904
01:51:23.64 --> 01:51:27.88
In fact, we had been walking on them. None had gone off until I found one.

1905
01:51:30.04 --> 01:51:35.80
But the medic, fortunately, you know, responded. It wasn't injured. Responded as you

1906
01:51:35.80 --> 01:51:44.68
trained to do everybody responded as they were trained to do selflessly, quickly, to try to save my life.

1907
01:51:44.68 --> 01:51:50.28
And I remember him putting on a turn-a-kit. You know, we practice putting these on and training,

1908
01:51:51.16 --> 01:51:58.44
but you don't ever really crank it down like you do when you need to, to say, actually save

1909
01:51:58.44 --> 01:52:03.96
someone's life and to actually cut off blood flow, a staunch blood flow. It's painful.

1910
01:52:05.08 --> 01:52:12.76
Just cranking that thing down. I wasn't in pain from the blast. I wasn't shocked. But I do remember

1911
01:52:12.76 --> 01:52:19.64
the turn-a-kit getting cranked down. But that wasn't enough. So we applied another one. And then another one.

1912
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.92
And another one. And another one. I'm told it was six total. Just cranking each one of them.

1913
01:52:26.92 --> 01:52:33.16
I'm going to try to stop the blood flow to my lower body. And then I'm told that there was

1914
01:52:33.16 --> 01:52:40.60
just this scramble going on. Unbeknownst to me, this is happening all external to my own

1915
01:52:40.60 --> 01:52:46.44
inner world right now. But to get the helicopters that initially dropped us up,

1916
01:52:47.64 --> 01:52:53.48
which according to the plan, we're going to go back to Candahart Airfield of 45 minutes flat away,

1917
01:52:54.92 --> 01:53:00.52
touch down refuel on load in Army Special Forces team and some Afghan commando troops bringing

1918
01:53:00.52 --> 01:53:05.08
these soldiers back to be a blocking force for when that target assault would commence.

1919
01:53:05.08 --> 01:53:11.16
So the plan was already to bring the helicopters back, but this is now a major contingency that has to

1920
01:53:11.16 --> 01:53:16.36
be responded to and time and fuel and everything is going to be of the essence. Now, I'm only

1921
01:53:16.36 --> 01:53:22.12
hearing this after the fact again, but it's going to be a race against the clock to try to get me out of

1922
01:53:22.12 --> 01:53:27.88
there because time is of the essence. And so the guys up above, they hadn't cleared the hilltop.

1923
01:53:27.88 --> 01:53:33.72
So there's no way you can land or hover a helicopter up there. I mean, it's just too dangerous.

1924
01:53:33.72 --> 01:53:39.56
So they gotta get me down off this hill that we had taken 20 minutes plus to climb.

1925
01:53:40.12 --> 01:53:46.76
When we were good, not to mention now dragging someone. I, I, I seem to remember them

1926
01:53:46.76 --> 01:53:51.24
carrying me and tripping and falling. I'm falling from a few feet in the air and it just,

1927
01:53:51.96 --> 01:53:56.04
in addition to being just damaging to my body, it just will slow. They needed to go

1928
01:53:56.04 --> 01:54:03.96
to the downman drag shoulder straps of my kit dragging me. And so this is where

1929
01:54:05.56 --> 01:54:10.44
their, their grit comes into play and their fitness and their desire to save my life and why I'm

1930
01:54:10.84 --> 01:54:18.28
eternally grateful to my teammates because they were having to drag me down a steep, dark, rocky hilltop

1931
01:54:18.28 --> 01:54:23.24
switching off the dragon. And it's fatigueing to do that. Maybe one or two are going at a time

1932
01:54:23.24 --> 01:54:29.16
in the rotating out. The medic is attending to me. And I remember that just, I was probably in and out

1933
01:54:29.16 --> 01:54:35.32
of consciousness, but I don't recall that. I just recall this just happening in real time and

1934
01:54:35.32 --> 01:54:40.92
with no interruptions. This, in people of acid, you think you're going to die or anything. No,

1935
01:54:40.92 --> 01:54:48.84
I didn't, I just didn't. There was no space in my mind. No capacity to think those thoughts because

1936
01:54:48.84 --> 01:54:58.92
I was consumed inundated by the pain, getting dragged over. It was sharp, gr gather rocks. And this,

1937
01:54:58.92 --> 01:55:08.12
I talk about the pain of six turnic, it's getting applied or any physical pain, doing a marathon

1938
01:55:08.12 --> 01:55:13.48
or running a, a, a a, a happy race with a log or something. It's just, it doesn't compare to that.

1939
01:55:13.48 --> 01:55:22.48
This was excruciating and it was all I could do just to try to stay awake and stay awake and stay awake and stay awake

1940
01:55:22.48 --> 01:55:30.76
and I think that was my desire to live that if I could stay awake that that is my

1941
01:55:33.48 --> 01:55:40.48
struggle to live into not succumb and so that was what I was focused on and

1942
01:55:40.48 --> 01:55:44.48
I thought I would live in this place where I was at the end.

1943
01:55:45.48 --> 01:55:48.48
Whether my brain was saying that or not, that's what was happening.

1944
01:55:48.48 --> 01:55:52.48
I wasn't thinking thoughts of you need to stay awake in order to live.

1945
01:55:52.48 --> 01:55:54.48
It just was stay awake.

1946
01:55:54.48 --> 01:56:01.48
And I think at this point it's getting very close to the helicopters in their fuel

1947
01:56:01.48 --> 01:56:03.48
times fuel calculation.

1948
01:56:03.48 --> 01:56:13.48
I'm told that I got loaded onto the helicopter really close to the ping of fuel mark.

1949
01:56:13.48 --> 01:56:20.48
So I mean there was a lot that had to line up for that to happen and for me to get on that helicopter.

1950
01:56:20.48 --> 01:56:22.48
I shook NYX hand.

1951
01:56:22.48 --> 01:56:26.48
I remember that I absolutely remember that he got off the back.

1952
01:56:26.48 --> 01:56:28.48
They were going to continue with the operation.

1953
01:56:28.48 --> 01:56:32.48
The tail ramp goes up and then I remember there was a light in my face and then

1954
01:56:32.48 --> 01:56:35.48
it was out.

1955
01:56:35.48 --> 01:56:38.48
I don't remember anything after that.

1956
01:56:38.48 --> 01:56:46.48
Yeah, the working with Jason now, he's talking me through this scenario a bunch of times that being said,

1957
01:56:46.48 --> 01:56:50.48
I don't want to try and give his whole side of the story.

1958
01:56:50.48 --> 01:56:53.48
But I mean just a couple key points.

1959
01:56:53.48 --> 01:57:00.48
If we think a femoral bleed can kill you in a minute and a half two minutes and you had two of them wide open.

1960
01:57:00.48 --> 01:57:05.48
And the guys were able to get in there and put enough turner kids on to stop that and keep you alive.

1961
01:57:05.48 --> 01:57:06.48
Like that right there.

1962
01:57:06.48 --> 01:57:15.48
The how quickly they must have done that is just a testament to the training and their determination to keep you alive.

1963
01:57:15.48 --> 01:57:27.48
I know that there was Jason talks about one of the seals that got on his hands and knees with the EOD guy with their bayonets to start probing for

1964
01:57:27.48 --> 01:57:33.48
the EOD's because they realized that the EOD's that were up there weren't magnetic so the sweeper wasn't finding them.

1965
01:57:33.48 --> 01:57:38.48
So these two guys are on their hands and knees probing for a path to get you guys out of there.

1966
01:57:38.48 --> 01:57:43.48
And then you know the OIC is getting all this stuff coordinated.

1967
01:57:43.48 --> 01:57:49.48
And Jason usually when he talks about this, he'll mention the fact that and actually lay for him.

1968
01:57:49.48 --> 01:57:56.48
I wrote about this same OIC when he was a.oIC, like calls me on the radio on a situation.

1969
01:57:56.48 --> 01:58:04.48
And he's like, hey, this is what we've got right now. We got down guys. We got a Iraqi killed like he's talking to calm cool collected voice and that's exactly what Jason said.

1970
01:58:04.48 --> 01:58:07.48
This massive explosion happened.

1971
01:58:07.48 --> 01:58:12.48
And Jason gives him a second and finally he wants to know what's going on. He says, hey, what was that.

1972
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:18.48
And that OIC calm, cool and collected said, we've got a that was a big that was an IED.

1973
01:58:18.48 --> 01:58:20.48
We've got a badly wounded guy.

1974
01:58:20.48 --> 01:58:24.48
We're working through it at this time and then like Jason just let him work.

1975
01:58:24.48 --> 01:58:36.48
But yeah, the all the things that fell into place from your own mentality to like stay awake to the medics and other guys get in turn.

1976
01:58:36.48 --> 01:58:38.48
It gets on to guys on their hands and knees.

1977
01:58:38.48 --> 01:58:45.48
Literally with their bayonets to try and find a way out of there and then the guys buddy carrying you and dragging you down.

1978
01:58:45.48 --> 01:58:50.48
I mean, it's it's a miracle that you're sitting here.

1979
01:58:50.48 --> 01:58:55.48
And the wounds were horrific.

1980
01:58:55.48 --> 01:58:58.48
You know, it wasn't it didn't stop at your legs, right?

1981
01:58:58.48 --> 01:59:04.48
This blast like torn your guts and everything else and just just absolutely horrendous.

1982
01:59:04.48 --> 01:59:11.48
And that's why you know, some of the initial reports that we got back on the strand was, you know, is he going to make it?

1983
01:59:11.48 --> 01:59:16.48
I don't know. And like I said in the beginning, when you hear a team guy say, I don't know.

1984
01:59:16.48 --> 01:59:19.48
That's a that's a bad sign.

1985
01:59:19.48 --> 01:59:27.48
So the out of the platoons and the task unit, they really did what they were supposed to do. They did what they were trained to do.

1986
01:59:27.48 --> 01:59:40.48
They did what they planned to do, you know, and it's a testament to our training and the determination of our guys and how much they care about each other and what they'll do to try and, you know, save their, save their friends.

1987
01:59:40.48 --> 01:59:46.48
Yeah, for any of them listening, I really just appreciate it.

1988
01:59:46.48 --> 02:00:01.48
So I don't even know what to say. But you know, when you think when I hear this, when I any time I hear an external account, such as what you're talking about Jason saying happened, it's just,

1989
02:00:01.48 --> 02:00:13.48
It's just a reminder to me how lucky I mean to be alive and I'll take life like this missing two legs any day over dying up on that hill any day.

1990
02:00:13.48 --> 02:00:17.48
So the pilots as well. Thank you.

1991
02:00:17.48 --> 02:00:24.48
Doctors, medical professionals, I mean, every step along the way, people respond to professionally bravely.

1992
02:00:24.48 --> 02:00:33.48
I remember before deployment, we're reading the after action reports and the task unit in country at the time, which we were going to be replacing.

1993
02:00:33.48 --> 02:00:40.48
We're doing the turnover off with they had in a situation where an Afghan soldier stepped on an IED as well.

1994
02:00:40.48 --> 02:00:54.48
Two legs gone and as bad as it may sound to say that that was practice and practice in real life saving in the field.

1995
02:00:54.48 --> 02:01:03.48
And I'm told that person later died of infection. They were able to keep him alive in the field later died of infection in an Afghan hospital.

1996
02:01:03.48 --> 02:01:22.48
Because infection is a serious risk and that is another thing that I'm very thankful for getting dragged down that hill to not, I mean, through ages and ages worth of goat shit and dust to not have massive infections is a miracle.

1997
02:01:22.48 --> 02:01:30.48
And yeah, I'm for many, many reasons I'm very, very grateful for the fact that I'm here and that I have what I have.

1998
02:01:30.48 --> 02:01:34.48
When did you wake up?

1999
02:01:34.48 --> 02:01:50.48
I woke up about 10 days later, give or take a day and I'm in what appears to be a hospital room with my mother's face about two feet away.

2000
02:01:50.48 --> 02:02:06.48
And I can tell you, when you go to bed at night and you wake up in the morning, you have a general sense of the progression of time relative to taking a nap this afternoon when you wake up.

2001
02:02:06.48 --> 02:02:14.48
When you are in a medically induced coma for about 10 days, you wake up and you don't have any sense of time progressing.

2002
02:02:14.48 --> 02:02:21.48
My last memories were being dragged of a helicopter into a helicopter at night, being on foot patrol, being the top of this mountain.

2003
02:02:21.48 --> 02:02:30.48
Now I wake up and I'm just all of a sudden in a hospital with my mom's face right there, I have no, how the hell did I get here? What the hell happened?

2004
02:02:30.48 --> 02:02:33.48
Is what I'm thinking? What the hell happened?

2005
02:02:33.48 --> 02:02:46.48
And so could you talk immediately? Did you look at your mom? What was that? What was that awakening like?

2006
02:02:46.48 --> 02:03:07.48
Summant from the basement of the hospital Bethesda Naval Hospital. My mother and sister have been told what had happened. In those 10 days had come to DC. So they were there. My sister was up above near the ICU. She calls down to our mom drinking coffee. So she comes up and kids up in the gown. Just remember seeing her right there.

2007
02:03:07.48 --> 02:03:21.48
And pretty quickly, I commented on the coffee breath was hitting me because I'm not a coffee drinker and her, she was so close to me. The coffee breath was just lasting.

2008
02:03:21.48 --> 02:03:24.48
I'm not a fan of coffee breath either.

2009
02:03:24.48 --> 02:03:43.48
But I remember no one was saying anything specific and my mind was off. I was on some heavy painkillers and my lower body was covered in blankets. I wasn't looking down that way. Maybe I knew but no one had said anything and I didn't know for a fact.

2010
02:03:43.48 --> 02:03:57.48
And I do remember asking a medical professional to the right of my bed whether my, I am, are my legs gone and that I'm that person replying yes. And that's, that's tough to hear.

2011
02:03:57.48 --> 02:04:03.48
It's tough to hear out of the blue. It's really tough to process and to think about.

2012
02:04:03.48 --> 02:04:22.48
You do have no idea at that point or did you, you said you had to let us in. I feel like I, I feel like when I was in the medically induced coma that maybe people's conversations around we were sinking in but I didn't know for a fact and and to be then told in a state.

2013
02:04:22.48 --> 02:04:34.48
I'm not completely lucid at this point but I can comprehend what that means and what that means for the future and that that is not the entirety of what's going on.

2014
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:43.48
Your legs are amputated above the knees. Your pelvis is shattered. You have a external fixator contraptions sticking out of you don't know how long that's going to be in.

2015
02:04:43.48 --> 02:04:58.48
You have a couple bags attached to you one of which is a cost me bag and I didn't know what that was but once someone explained it to me. I'm thinking okay that's something people don't want to have normally a bladder to coming out of my bladder.

2016
02:04:58.48 --> 02:05:01.48
My fingers are in.

2017
02:05:01.48 --> 02:05:19.48
Casts and I had a burning fever and this I had a ng2 but my nose down my throat into my stomach I was going to surgery Monday Wednesday Friday there was one week I remember Monday Wednesday Thursday Friday surgery and these are surgeries that are at a minimum seven hours.

2018
02:05:19.48 --> 02:05:36.48
Sometimes 10-12 there's 14 hours surgeries. I mean I was clocking 20-30 something hours a week of surgery time easy week after week after week and so my intestines weren't working and actually with all that I had going on.

2019
02:05:36.48 --> 02:05:52.48
This ng2 up my nose down my throat to try to decompress my stomach because the intestines weren't working was the beta my existence because it was I wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything because my stomach wasn't functioning so I was fed and I traded by IV.

2020
02:05:52.48 --> 02:06:06.48
So you can imagine how dry your throat gets you cannot drink a single sip of water. A lot of takes some ice chips but in order to talk to anybody I had to do gum to generate the saliva to do so and I had a lot of people coming in the room wanting to talk.

2021
02:06:06.48 --> 02:06:27.48
I mean on the day that I woke up I'm told there were over 70 people in the visiting room creating a stressful environment for my mother. I wanted to rip that ng2 out but I knew they'd put the thing back in and I'd be awake when they put it in and I was awake at one point when they did put it in not because I ripped it out but it is not fun to have that thing inserted.

2022
02:06:27.48 --> 02:06:53.48
And then yeah this fever this inexplicable fever we thought it was infection but it wasn't infection but I just had this burning fever but the worst part about that was that this fever combined with a bad mental reaction that I was having to the pain killer wasn't on the right kind of pain killer that worked with my mind.

2023
02:06:53.48 --> 02:07:22.48
And so you can imagine a bad fever a bad reaction to the pain killers nightmares delirium all centered around afghanistan my last memories I remember one and these are these are as real as I'm talking to you right now these nightmares it's delirium I mean just it was I'm in this just like we're talking right now there's no ability to look from an outside perspective and say okay this isn't real you're going to get through this.

2024
02:07:22.48 --> 02:07:51.48
You're going to wake up you're in it my platoon calling me a coward for being not on the deployment with them and this kind of thing being on a foot patrol getting dismembered by some kind of rack machine I mean just just awful stuff and so this is really the ground zero low point for me waking up in an ICU room finding out this is going on and then and then just struggling.

2025
02:07:51.48 --> 02:08:20.48
How long is this sort of bottom time last for I was in the ICU for three weeks right off the bat I ended up going back there again, but three weeks not eating not drinking energy tube and week after week of surgery so it was a good 20 plus days of just really just hell I mean the there was a service member in the room I see room next to me was a helicopter probably been shot through the head I heard about him.

2026
02:08:20.48 --> 02:08:28.48
Managed to land the helicopter and at one point he died while I was in the ICU.

2027
02:08:28.48 --> 02:08:38.48
Only two visitors could come at a time you're hooked up to every contraption on earth monitoring your body your your body signals.

2028
02:08:38.48 --> 02:08:51.48
They can't ever make the room dark your close to the nurse's station you can't sleep every hour they're checking you so I wasn't sleeping I remember if you took away.

2029
02:08:51.48 --> 02:09:06.48
I was in a surgery time that it was an astonishingly long time that I had last slept and then when I could fall asleep it would just be the it would be delirium nightmares and one point.

2030
02:09:06.48 --> 02:09:22.48
One of the most important thing about five or six in the morning I see you nurse who sees a lot I mean it's the combat ICU room in a hospital.

2031
02:09:22.48 --> 02:09:28.28
I don't know which one of those nightmares that I've described this was, but there was

2032
02:09:28.28 --> 02:09:30.60
just like a total bottom point.

2033
02:09:30.60 --> 02:09:34.16
I was on to Lauderd, which is a very powerful opiate.

2034
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:39.76
They did shift me order morphine, and that was much better for not just pain management,

2035
02:09:39.76 --> 02:09:41.72
but also for my psyche and everything.

2036
02:09:41.72 --> 02:09:51.84
Then do you start like making a turning point and they wrap up some of the surgeries and

2037
02:09:51.84 --> 02:09:56.12
is it like a slow crawl out of the pit?

2038
02:09:56.12 --> 02:09:57.12
It is.

2039
02:09:57.12 --> 02:10:04.52
In addition to dealing with some of the factors of disconnection from the platoon, and that was

2040
02:10:04.52 --> 02:10:09.20
also going through my mind, there was progress and then there'd be setbacks.

2041
02:10:09.20 --> 02:10:11.68
Let's say it's three steps forward, two steps back.

2042
02:10:11.68 --> 02:10:13.28
You're just going to have to get used to this.

2043
02:10:13.28 --> 02:10:17.92
If there's three steps forward, there probably like 33 steps back in the beginning, because

2044
02:10:17.92 --> 02:10:20.12
it's just it seemed like that there would be setbacks.

2045
02:10:20.12 --> 02:10:23.52
I alluded to the fact that I couldn't eat or drink for a few weeks.

2046
02:10:23.52 --> 02:10:25.32
At one point I'm going to do the swallow test.

2047
02:10:25.32 --> 02:10:27.20
This is a big step here.

2048
02:10:27.20 --> 02:10:33.08
If I can eat some chocolate pudding and swallow it, I've passed and then I can maybe actually

2049
02:10:33.08 --> 02:10:36.56
take some food and not have to be fed by IV.

2050
02:10:36.56 --> 02:10:40.08
I took this chocolate pudding and I'm going to taste it really good.

2051
02:10:40.08 --> 02:10:43.28
Had any food weeks.

2052
02:10:43.28 --> 02:10:47.84
I just a couple minutes later, it all just comes back out and it fails.

2053
02:10:47.84 --> 02:10:50.28
Back on the NG tube.

2054
02:10:50.28 --> 02:10:51.48
IV.

2055
02:10:51.48 --> 02:10:55.48
I had a routine surgery on my hand.

2056
02:10:55.48 --> 02:11:01.12
My right hand was damaged and there needed to be a plate put in.

2057
02:11:01.12 --> 02:11:05.32
I had a tendon that was damaged and so a very routine surgery.

2058
02:11:05.32 --> 02:11:08.20
I'm actually out of the ICU at this point.

2059
02:11:08.20 --> 02:11:11.64
I wake up from the surgery and I'm back in the ICU.

2060
02:11:11.64 --> 02:11:12.64
What happened?

2061
02:11:12.64 --> 02:11:14.24
Why am I here again?

2062
02:11:14.24 --> 02:11:19.24
I got the admiral of the hospital on down coming through apologizing.

2063
02:11:19.24 --> 02:11:21.96
Something bad happened in this surgery.

2064
02:11:21.96 --> 02:11:22.96
What was it?

2065
02:11:22.96 --> 02:11:28.52
Apparently, I had a normal amount of potassium in my system and the resident anesthesiologist.

2066
02:11:28.52 --> 02:11:30.24
These are training hospitals.

2067
02:11:30.24 --> 02:11:32.56
They're always training new military doctors.

2068
02:11:32.56 --> 02:11:34.56
The resident anesthesiologist.

2069
02:11:34.56 --> 02:11:39.36
Either messed up or just didn't take note of the amount of potassium in my system and

2070
02:11:39.36 --> 02:11:44.08
it administered an anesthetic that releases potassium.

2071
02:11:44.08 --> 02:11:49.24
My system in the middle of this very routine surgery flooded with potassium and my heart

2072
02:11:49.24 --> 02:11:50.24
stopped.

2073
02:11:50.24 --> 02:11:58.64
I'm told by the surgeon who responded brilliantly that she had to put the chest pedals

2074
02:11:58.64 --> 02:12:02.80
on me and shock me back into function.

2075
02:12:02.80 --> 02:12:07.88
I wake up from I basically died and had to be resuscitated in a routine surgery.

2076
02:12:07.88 --> 02:12:13.72
After going through all of this weeks later, it's, I mean, to me that's unacceptable.

2077
02:12:13.72 --> 02:12:18.04
You may think you're over the hill, but you're not.

2078
02:12:18.04 --> 02:12:24.32
Anytime you go in a surgery, it's a risk.

2079
02:12:24.32 --> 02:12:30.12
It seems hard to, and a lot of things have to fault the line to get you to survive coming

2080
02:12:30.12 --> 02:12:32.76
off the battlefield, but it's like just the beginning.

2081
02:12:32.76 --> 02:12:40.12
I mean, you know, I'm, in addition to realizing all the medical complications that I have,

2082
02:12:40.12 --> 02:12:43.48
you're thinking, what is my life going to look like?

2083
02:12:43.48 --> 02:12:45.48
How am I going to do basic things?

2084
02:12:45.48 --> 02:12:47.04
Am I going to be a wheelchair?

2085
02:12:47.04 --> 02:12:48.76
Am I even going to get out of this hospital?

2086
02:12:48.76 --> 02:12:50.68
Am I going to get through surgery?

2087
02:12:50.68 --> 02:12:53.20
Like, it's a walk again.

2088
02:12:53.20 --> 02:12:54.60
How am I going to shower?

2089
02:12:54.60 --> 02:12:58.08
Can I drive a car?

2090
02:12:58.08 --> 02:13:03.80
Can I be in girls?

2091
02:13:03.80 --> 02:13:05.44
This was my first combat deployment.

2092
02:13:05.44 --> 02:13:08.32
This was the first operation within the deployment.

2093
02:13:08.32 --> 02:13:15.36
My platoon wasn't even on the ground yet, and so it just felt like, you know, why me?

2094
02:13:15.36 --> 02:13:20.64
I would tell myself, well, okay, let's just say, if someone had to, upon that whole

2095
02:13:20.64 --> 02:13:23.40
had to step, like, you should want it to be you.

2096
02:13:23.40 --> 02:13:26.28
You should say, I'm the one you can handle this.

2097
02:13:26.28 --> 02:13:29.04
I survived, I can make a good life.

2098
02:13:29.04 --> 02:13:30.44
Do I really feel that?

2099
02:13:30.44 --> 02:13:32.36
I'm not just saying that.

2100
02:13:32.36 --> 02:13:36.08
I want to believe that it should have been me if it had to happen to someone.

2101
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:37.92
Do I really believe that?

2102
02:13:37.92 --> 02:13:44.28
How, you know, this job felt like my calling is, the only thing I ever wanted to do, really

2103
02:13:44.28 --> 02:13:47.76
in my career.

2104
02:13:47.76 --> 02:13:49.32
And it just seemed like it was gone.

2105
02:13:49.32 --> 02:13:52.52
My identity was very much wrapped up in being a team guy.

2106
02:13:52.52 --> 02:13:56.24
Yeah, okay, you can still stay in the teams, but guess what?

2107
02:13:56.24 --> 02:14:01.80
I had a senior ranking officer come at one point in visit, and I'm trying to do physical

2108
02:14:01.80 --> 02:14:05.56
therapy, and really was focused on my physical therapy, not talking to this individual

2109
02:14:05.56 --> 02:14:06.56
so much.

2110
02:14:06.56 --> 02:14:09.32
It's certainly not talking about career plans, and it was kind of saying, well, you

2111
02:14:09.32 --> 02:14:10.80
can stay in the teams.

2112
02:14:10.80 --> 02:14:13.60
We can send you to acquisition school.

2113
02:14:13.60 --> 02:14:22.08
And I'm just, like, this, that's just not, you know, so, okay, you know, I'm going to

2114
02:14:22.08 --> 02:14:26.04
do this job the way in which you'd been doing it, even if you can stay in the community.

2115
02:14:26.04 --> 02:14:29.24
But as I said, you're either in a platoon or your adult platoon, and I'm going to be out

2116
02:14:29.24 --> 02:14:33.44
of a platoon, people say, yeah, but, you know, as an officer, you progress through, you're

2117
02:14:33.44 --> 02:14:37.88
going to be, even if this didn't happen, you'd be, you know, you'd be administrative, you

2118
02:14:37.88 --> 02:14:43.08
do be doing some staff tours, and yeah, okay, this happened on the first operation within

2119
02:14:43.08 --> 02:14:44.88
the deployment, it's, you don't get it.

2120
02:14:44.88 --> 02:14:46.56
It's just, it's not the same.

2121
02:14:46.56 --> 02:14:51.48
But most importantly, it was just, I'm not going to be on this deployment with my teammates.

2122
02:14:51.48 --> 02:14:55.80
If this had to have happened to me, let it happen at the very end of the deployment, it was

2123
02:14:55.80 --> 02:15:01.40
what I was thinking, but to be disconnected like that is tough.

2124
02:15:01.40 --> 02:15:07.60
And so, in addition to a physical component, I think there was absolutely a mental challenge

2125
02:15:07.60 --> 02:15:10.08
that I was also dealing with.

2126
02:15:10.08 --> 02:15:17.72
What was the first, like, what was the first positive step or the positive like that you saw?

2127
02:15:17.72 --> 02:15:23.04
I remember one day, and this is very basic, but they were saying, okay, we're going to work

2128
02:15:23.04 --> 02:15:24.04
on getting you up out of bed.

2129
02:15:24.04 --> 02:15:26.08
Yeah, I had this shattered pelvis.

2130
02:15:26.08 --> 02:15:28.80
It was surgically fixed with two screws.

2131
02:15:28.80 --> 02:15:33.20
I had this external fixator that is a contraption.

2132
02:15:33.20 --> 02:15:37.36
The state in place for about a hundred days, they took it out surgically at one point, but

2133
02:15:37.36 --> 02:15:38.36
that meant that I could not.

2134
02:15:38.36 --> 02:15:41.20
Not an external fixator on your pelvis.

2135
02:15:41.20 --> 02:15:43.40
It's drilled over a hundred days.

2136
02:15:43.40 --> 02:15:46.80
Yeah, drilled into the, it's too cross bars extending out.

2137
02:15:46.80 --> 02:15:51.80
You can't, I happen to be a stomach inside sleeper, and in addition to everything else going

2138
02:15:51.80 --> 02:15:56.88
in part of the reason with a sleep, maybe, just that I couldn't turn, so I'm stuck on my

2139
02:15:56.88 --> 02:15:58.24
back.

2140
02:15:58.24 --> 02:16:04.52
And when this thing gets taken out surgically, they're okay, you're ready to get, we need

2141
02:16:04.52 --> 02:16:08.96
to get you out of your back off of the bed because you could develop big bed sores in this

2142
02:16:08.96 --> 02:16:10.72
kind of thing.

2143
02:16:10.72 --> 02:16:12.24
But it's not going to be easy to balance.

2144
02:16:12.24 --> 02:16:13.24
I'm like, why?

2145
02:16:13.24 --> 02:16:14.84
I'm sitting out, it's not a big deal.

2146
02:16:14.84 --> 02:16:20.000
I set up, like, two, one person on either side of me, sit me up out of the hospital bed,

2147
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.60
and they let go, and it was just fall back.

2148
02:16:22.60 --> 02:16:25.88
It's because your abs were, or you just didn't know how to do it.

2149
02:16:25.88 --> 02:16:31.44
I think the system of balance, I don't know if we have fluids that kind of dictate our

2150
02:16:31.44 --> 02:16:37.60
balance, that just was gone after being bedridden for a hundred days.

2151
02:16:37.60 --> 02:16:42.12
I mean, definitely I had to atrophied in strength, but I think just the whole system of balance

2152
02:16:42.12 --> 02:16:43.12
was at last.

2153
02:16:43.12 --> 02:16:45.56
So this is still not like a mask in first.

2154
02:16:45.56 --> 02:16:46.56
That was a mask.

2155
02:16:46.56 --> 02:16:49.92
But, but after a few efforts,

2156
02:16:49.92 --> 02:16:55.40
I was able to hold it, and it was like doing a plank or something.

2157
02:16:55.40 --> 02:16:58.80
You know, we were just shaking and you're folding and you're concentrating, but I was able

2158
02:16:58.80 --> 02:17:00.60
to hold it for a little bit at time.

2159
02:17:00.60 --> 02:17:02.08
And I felt, okay, I'm out of bed.

2160
02:17:02.08 --> 02:17:03.08
Okay, that's awesome.

2161
02:17:03.08 --> 02:17:06.92
At some point, this means I'm going to be able to transfer into a wheelchair now.

2162
02:17:06.92 --> 02:17:10.68
And then when I get in this wheelchair, I'm going to be doing laps around this hospital.

2163
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:13.84
I'm going to do as much as video or fired up immediately.

2164
02:17:13.84 --> 02:17:16.12
To get out, to get outside.

2165
02:17:16.12 --> 02:17:21.40
I mean, that was actually one of the other challenges when I became an inpatient.

2166
02:17:21.40 --> 02:17:23.44
It just didn't make sense to me.

2167
02:17:23.44 --> 02:17:25.24
Why can't I just get into a courtyard?

2168
02:17:25.24 --> 02:17:26.24
Just to get outside.

2169
02:17:26.24 --> 02:17:29.08
If it's a sunny day, that would be awesome.

2170
02:17:29.08 --> 02:17:30.24
I love being outside.

2171
02:17:30.24 --> 02:17:32.08
I'm a outdoor or a reason for it.

2172
02:17:32.08 --> 02:17:33.08
Is it infections?

2173
02:17:33.08 --> 02:17:34.08
Or what is it?

2174
02:17:34.08 --> 02:17:40.52
Well, the cynical interpretation is that when you're in an ICU forget about it, but when you're

2175
02:17:40.52 --> 02:17:46.08
in the inpatient status, there's a nurse who's balancing now for patients total.

2176
02:17:46.08 --> 02:17:47.08
I see you.

2177
02:17:47.08 --> 02:17:48.72
It's one-on-one.

2178
02:17:48.72 --> 02:17:51.76
You have undivoted attention from your nurse.

2179
02:17:51.76 --> 02:17:55.32
But now you're getting juggled with a few other patients.

2180
02:17:55.32 --> 02:18:00.20
And so I had a lot of, I still had some apparatus attached to the bed.

2181
02:18:00.20 --> 02:18:07.68
And all of that would take a team of people not to mention the on duty nurse who then might

2182
02:18:07.68 --> 02:18:09.20
not be able to attend to the other patients.

2183
02:18:09.20 --> 02:18:14.12
So there was a logistic aspect to this that I think was challenging at the end of the day.

2184
02:18:14.12 --> 02:18:16.12
I felt this means so much to me.

2185
02:18:16.12 --> 02:18:17.12
Can't you just do that?

2186
02:18:17.12 --> 02:18:19.36
I just want to get outside.

2187
02:18:19.36 --> 02:18:22.44
And there was one that they're going to make it happen finally.

2188
02:18:22.44 --> 02:18:23.96
This was after a while.

2189
02:18:23.96 --> 02:18:25.40
I think longer than it should have been.

2190
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:31.40
But I don't want to be to reprimanding of them.

2191
02:18:31.40 --> 02:18:32.40
They got out of the courtyard.

2192
02:18:32.40 --> 02:18:33.40
It was a sunny day.

2193
02:18:33.40 --> 02:18:35.12
It was kind of like the sun had come through.

2194
02:18:35.12 --> 02:18:38.52
It was a very powerful moment for me.

2195
02:18:38.52 --> 02:18:41.12
Just to be outside, my mom and sister were with me.

2196
02:18:41.12 --> 02:18:42.12
And OK.

2197
02:18:42.12 --> 02:18:43.12
I got outside.

2198
02:18:43.12 --> 02:18:45.12
That's a step.

2199
02:18:45.12 --> 02:18:47.12
Eventually you get into the wheelchair.

2200
02:18:47.12 --> 02:18:53.12
And eventually I was able to start doing laps around the hospital, pushing myself.

2201
02:18:53.12 --> 02:19:04.12
I want people to push me but to be able to just cover ground on my own is I think a basic human need

2202
02:19:04.12 --> 02:19:06.12
that needs to be fulfilled.

2203
02:19:06.12 --> 02:19:12.12
And when you're getting pushed in a wheelchair or on a bed by someone else, it's not the same thing.

2204
02:19:12.12 --> 02:19:19.12
So it's about me getting a wheelchair and be able to move.

2205
02:19:19.12 --> 02:19:25.12
So then when did you start making, what was the next big step that you took?

2206
02:19:25.12 --> 02:19:28.12
Like you're now in a wheelchair, you're able to get yourself around.

2207
02:19:28.12 --> 02:19:34.12
Yeah, I think the next step was there's going to be a day pass coming up.

2208
02:19:34.12 --> 02:19:37.12
OK, a day pass means not the whole day but a couple hours.

2209
02:19:37.12 --> 02:19:43.12
I'm going to get to go out of this hospital with my mother and sister out to dinner.

2210
02:19:43.12 --> 02:19:48.12
I'll be in a wheelchair and it'll be about two hours.

2211
02:19:48.12 --> 02:19:49.12
And you come back.

2212
02:19:49.12 --> 02:19:55.12
In anticipation of this laying there in bed and thinking, wow, I'm going to leave this hospital.

2213
02:19:55.12 --> 02:19:58.12
Well, second, I'll be like, that's going to be awesome.

2214
02:19:58.12 --> 02:19:59.12
Oh, wait.

2215
02:19:59.12 --> 02:20:01.12
People are going to look at me.

2216
02:20:01.12 --> 02:20:02.12
I don't look right.

2217
02:20:02.12 --> 02:20:03.12
I don't look normal.

2218
02:20:03.12 --> 02:20:05.12
I look different.

2219
02:20:05.12 --> 02:20:09.12
I'm used to being anonymous.

2220
02:20:09.12 --> 02:20:11.12
Nothing, you know, don't stand out really.

2221
02:20:11.12 --> 02:20:13.12
It's an average guy.

2222
02:20:13.12 --> 02:20:15.12
Now I look different.

2223
02:20:15.12 --> 02:20:16.12
Radically different.

2224
02:20:16.12 --> 02:20:17.12
What are people going to stare at me?

2225
02:20:17.12 --> 02:20:19.12
What's going to be like?

2226
02:20:19.12 --> 02:20:26.12
And I was just thinking, you know, I'm going to have to get used to this is my future reality.

2227
02:20:26.12 --> 02:20:30.12
Whether I'm in a wheelchair or whether I'm on prosthetic legs, you look different.

2228
02:20:30.12 --> 02:20:34.12
And if you do not get used to this somehow, and eventually,

2229
02:20:34.12 --> 02:20:38.12
you're going to be bitter for the rest of your life.

2230
02:20:38.12 --> 02:20:43.12
So I started thinking along these lines of body image and stuff.

2231
02:20:43.12 --> 02:20:46.12
Whenever I get these prosthetics and I don't have them yet.

2232
02:20:46.12 --> 02:20:49.12
Whenever that is, I don't know when it's going to be.

2233
02:20:49.12 --> 02:20:51.12
I'm going to boost them up a little bit.

2234
02:20:51.12 --> 02:20:53.12
So I'm at the dollar.

2235
02:20:53.12 --> 02:20:57.12
I was five nine and I was thinking six foot would be pretty good.

2236
02:20:57.12 --> 02:21:00.12
If people are going to look at me, I might as well be taller.

2237
02:21:00.12 --> 02:21:02.12
But I remember getting on that day pass, you know,

2238
02:21:02.12 --> 02:21:07.12
I'm actually long headed bin from like, from you showed up there until now,

2239
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:09.12
you're getting your first day pass.

2240
02:21:09.12 --> 02:21:12.12
I think it would say two solid months.

2241
02:21:12.12 --> 02:21:17.12
Two months, which in the grant, you know, at the time it seemed like a long time in the grand scheme of things.

2242
02:21:17.12 --> 02:21:20.12
Things were moving fairly rapidly.

2243
02:21:20.12 --> 02:21:23.12
I had the bag still.

2244
02:21:23.12 --> 02:21:26.12
I'm about to be discharged from Bethesda.

2245
02:21:26.12 --> 02:21:28.12
About to be an outpatient.

2246
02:21:28.12 --> 02:21:30.12
First I got to go to Walter Reed.

2247
02:21:30.12 --> 02:21:35.12
That's what I'm going to do. The physical therapy. I got to be an inpatient there for a few days just to get in their system.

2248
02:21:35.12 --> 02:21:37.12
Did the day pass?

2249
02:21:37.12 --> 02:21:41.12
My mother and sister were being taken care of by special operations command.

2250
02:21:41.12 --> 02:21:48.12
They had a program to provide housing, apartment out in town for the family of service members.

2251
02:21:48.12 --> 02:21:53.12
And also for the service members for me, whenever I am allowed to be out of this hospital,

2252
02:21:53.12 --> 02:21:56.12
this is a privilege and a really a luxury that

2253
02:21:56.12 --> 02:22:01.12
is a very important thing.

2254
02:22:01.12 --> 02:22:04.12
Army and Marine Corps soldiers, non-so-com, didn't have.

2255
02:22:04.12 --> 02:22:11.12
At the time I didn't know any of this, but yeah, this was very fortunate for my mother and sister had a apartment out of town that I would be able to go to.

2256
02:22:11.12 --> 02:22:16.12
So the next thing and this is just to get that discharge to become an outpatient.

2257
02:22:16.12 --> 02:22:20.12
And then after that, it's, you're starting physical therapy.

2258
02:22:20.12 --> 02:22:22.12
You're going to learn how to walk again.

2259
02:22:22.12 --> 02:22:24.12
Roger that.

2260
02:22:24.12 --> 02:22:28.12
You're going to learn how to walk.

2261
02:22:28.12 --> 02:22:30.12
So now you start learning to walk.

2262
02:22:30.12 --> 02:22:32.12
Yeah, and this is what you're an outpatient.

2263
02:22:32.12 --> 02:22:33.12
So now you're living out and down.

2264
02:22:33.12 --> 02:22:37.12
Living with my sister, our mother had gone back to Kansas to resume work.

2265
02:22:37.12 --> 02:22:41.12
And, you know, she felt like things were in a good place, but she had been let go.

2266
02:22:41.12 --> 02:22:46.12
Not allowed to go to the East Coast covered, long as you need.

2267
02:22:46.12 --> 02:22:48.12
But, you know, I'm living with my sister.

2268
02:22:48.12 --> 02:22:50.12
My sister was a nurse in the York City.

2269
02:22:50.12 --> 02:22:55.12
I went to her job to come down and take care of me. And when I was in inpatient, other people are taking care of me.

2270
02:22:55.12 --> 02:22:58.12
But they're absolutely where's was a phase where I was ready to be.

2271
02:22:58.12 --> 02:23:02.12
Out of the hospital, I was no means ready to take care of myself and live out.

2272
02:23:02.12 --> 02:23:10.12
I know where and I'm a single guy and so the fact that my sister did that is just so, so awesome.

2273
02:23:10.12 --> 02:23:16.12
And she would drive me to the hospital every day from my physical therapy and it's now it's okay.

2274
02:23:16.12 --> 02:23:18.92
You're going to get fitted for prosthetics.

2275
02:23:18.92 --> 02:23:21.60
You're going to do physical therapy every day.

2276
02:23:21.60 --> 02:23:22.60
That's working out.

2277
02:23:22.60 --> 02:23:24.28
I'm going to be working out every day.

2278
02:23:24.28 --> 02:23:25.52
This is a new sport.

2279
02:23:25.52 --> 02:23:26.92
It's kind of how I thought about it.

2280
02:23:26.92 --> 02:23:29.08
You've learned how to walk on these prosthetics.

2281
02:23:29.08 --> 02:23:30.16
First, you're going to have short ones.

2282
02:23:30.16 --> 02:23:31.16
They don't bend.

2283
02:23:31.16 --> 02:23:32.68
Then you're going to have bending ones.

2284
02:23:32.68 --> 02:23:33.68
Because I don't have knees.

2285
02:23:33.68 --> 02:23:36.04
So the prosthetics are going to be my knee joint.

2286
02:23:36.04 --> 02:23:37.04
It's going to be tough.

2287
02:23:37.04 --> 02:23:39.92
You got as much time as you need.

2288
02:23:39.92 --> 02:23:44.36
Every Monday through Friday, every day, you get two hours of physical therapy.

2289
02:23:44.36 --> 02:23:48.40
I have a lot of other appointments with the various departments that I fell under, plastic surgery,

2290
02:23:48.40 --> 02:23:51.12
orthopedic surgery, etc.

2291
02:23:51.12 --> 02:23:54.08
So it was just hospital days.

2292
02:23:54.08 --> 02:23:57.52
End up being in the hospital four to six hours, just about every day.

2293
02:23:57.52 --> 02:24:03.68
As an outpatient coming in, driving there with my sister, coming back at the end of the day.

2294
02:24:03.68 --> 02:24:11.36
Then how long was it before you were up on your normal, full-size prosthetics?

2295
02:24:11.36 --> 02:24:18.000
Yeah, that was, so my goal was, okay, my platoon is coming back in March.

2296
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.04
If I could be on the knee prosthetics, the ones that bend.

2297
02:24:21.04 --> 02:24:25.000
Even if I have crutches or it canes, that's okay.

2298
02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.12
But just to be there on the flight, not in a wheelchair.

2299
02:24:28.12 --> 02:24:29.92
If I can get up on the prosthetics.

2300
02:24:29.92 --> 02:24:32.12
So first you have to go through the short legs.

2301
02:24:32.12 --> 02:24:34.08
That was late January, I want to say.

2302
02:24:34.08 --> 02:24:37.92
All of February, sort of, I've learned how to walk on the knees.

2303
02:24:37.92 --> 02:24:41.000
Because they bend under you, it's really difficult.

2304
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.92
Keeping in mind that I'd atrophy a lot.

2305
02:24:42.92 --> 02:24:45.76
You need a lot of hip strength and caution.

2306
02:24:45.76 --> 02:24:49.76
Even now, this walking along distance, because they're heavy, it's fatiguing.

2307
02:24:49.76 --> 02:24:54.44
But so you can imagine when you're really, really at this low point, it's very difficult.

2308
02:24:54.44 --> 02:24:56.96
I would just be so tired at the end of the day.

2309
02:24:56.96 --> 02:25:01.40
I had to, I remember thinking at the time, you got two hours of physical therapy.

2310
02:25:01.40 --> 02:25:03.56
That's what's automatically provided.

2311
02:25:03.56 --> 02:25:07.92
The physical therapists are working with other service members and they don't have time to

2312
02:25:07.92 --> 02:25:12.36
be with you for four hours or five hours when I was thinking, okay, if I do twice the amount

2313
02:25:12.36 --> 02:25:16.36
of physical therapy per day, I'll get out of here and half the time.

2314
02:25:16.36 --> 02:25:19.88
The math doesn't work like that.

2315
02:25:19.88 --> 02:25:26.36
But I also got to sit, when I got to Walter Reed physical therapy, I was surrounded by dozens

2316
02:25:26.36 --> 02:25:29.36
of injured service members.

2317
02:25:29.36 --> 02:25:35.76
And some of these people were missing three limbs, four limbs, four limbs, three limbs.

2318
02:25:35.76 --> 02:25:40.60
I remember one day looking at the therapy mat next to me.

2319
02:25:40.60 --> 02:25:46.000
It's pretty easy to look around and you can see a quadruple amputee here.

2320
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.04
In this case, a triple amputee, I don't know what was going on in his head, but he was

2321
02:25:50.04 --> 02:25:54.44
working hard, right then and there to make his life better.

2322
02:25:54.44 --> 02:26:01.24
And so once I got in that environment, it becomes competitive and it also provides a sense

2323
02:26:01.24 --> 02:26:02.96
of perspective.

2324
02:26:02.96 --> 02:26:08.000
I'm not saying that perspective just let me, okay, I feel better about myself because

2325
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:17.28
others have it worse, but it did allow me to really highlight the unique circumstances,

2326
02:26:17.28 --> 02:26:20.24
the conditions that I should be thankful for.

2327
02:26:20.24 --> 02:26:22.68
Just real, okay, I've got arms that work.

2328
02:26:22.68 --> 02:26:23.68
I've got a brain that works.

2329
02:26:23.68 --> 02:26:31.44
I can see, I can hear, I can talk, I'm not badly burnt, I'm not blinded, I'm alive.

2330
02:26:31.44 --> 02:26:39.36
And we know people who are not here, I mean, their families would get anything for them

2331
02:26:39.36 --> 02:26:43.64
to be in this situation, just be missing two legs, but to be alive.

2332
02:26:43.64 --> 02:26:45.24
I know that.

2333
02:26:45.24 --> 02:26:51.44
And so I'm going to be thankful for what I have, not focus on what I'm missing.

2334
02:26:51.44 --> 02:26:55.16
That is really what that environment taught me.

2335
02:26:55.16 --> 02:27:02.16
I want point, did you start saying to yourself, you're going to start doing wild shit again?

2336
02:27:02.16 --> 02:27:08.56
I really like hiking and running, trail running, just get on the woods.

2337
02:27:08.56 --> 02:27:15.16
I actually did a couple extreme high- and high-intz-side stupid hiking excursions, either

2338
02:27:15.16 --> 02:27:20.60
before or after deployment, because that's when you get the most amount of time.

2339
02:27:20.60 --> 02:27:25.88
These like, pre- or post- deployment leave, excursions, but my point, I just like being outside,

2340
02:27:25.88 --> 02:27:27.20
and I like being active.

2341
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:31.96
And so I was definitely thinking, I want to run, and that's a good goal to have because

2342
02:27:31.96 --> 02:27:37.80
in order to run, you need to be able to walk, so that kept me motivated.

2343
02:27:37.80 --> 02:27:43.40
And I started, I got a hand cycle, and I'm in DC, right in the hand cycle.

2344
02:27:43.40 --> 02:27:49.28
It's not a great one, but at least was able to start getting outside and just do it by myself

2345
02:27:49.28 --> 02:27:53.68
on a bike show near the apartment where my sister and I were living.

2346
02:27:53.68 --> 02:27:55.88
Were you able to meet the Paltoon when they came home?

2347
02:27:55.88 --> 02:27:56.88
Yeah, yeah.

2348
02:27:56.88 --> 02:27:58.68
So what was that like?

2349
02:27:58.68 --> 02:28:07.92
So the generosity of someone affiliated with the hotel del Coronado put a room up for my

2350
02:28:07.92 --> 02:28:12.60
sister and I had to go out to San Diego Coronado, stay at the hotel del Oceanfront.

2351
02:28:12.60 --> 02:28:14.000
Well, I got the oceanfront room.

2352
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.60
She had the other one to dinner face the oceanfront.

2353
02:28:16.60 --> 02:28:22.68
And then the Paltoon redeployment bird kept getting delayed.

2354
02:28:22.68 --> 02:28:25.16
So I think this was supposed to be a couple of days.

2355
02:28:25.16 --> 02:28:28.64
And it would be like a two week stay at the hotel del waiting.

2356
02:28:28.64 --> 02:28:32.52
And I was at North Island on the flight line when they got off.

2357
02:28:32.52 --> 02:28:41.40
I think I may have had one cane, but that was for me, at least, a very proud moment to just be

2358
02:28:41.40 --> 02:28:42.40
at least be standing.

2359
02:28:42.40 --> 02:28:46.28
And I don't know if any of them knew when they got off the bird that I was going to be there.

2360
02:28:46.28 --> 02:28:52.000
I don't know what they were told, but I shook everybody's hand and then the festivities

2361
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.44
commenced.

2362
02:28:54.44 --> 02:28:55.44
Yeah.

2363
02:28:55.44 --> 02:29:00.36
So back to the hand cycle, you're starting to think about being able to do that.

2364
02:29:00.36 --> 02:29:03.48
You're starting to push yourself.

2365
02:29:03.48 --> 02:29:04.48
What was it like?

2366
02:29:04.48 --> 02:29:07.84
Didn't you end up doing the New York City marathon at some point?

2367
02:29:07.84 --> 02:29:08.84
Oh, I did.

2368
02:29:08.84 --> 02:29:09.84
I did.

2369
02:29:09.84 --> 02:29:10.84
This was on a hand cycle.

2370
02:29:10.84 --> 02:29:15.56
And part of it was like hand cycle and then run the last stretch.

2371
02:29:15.56 --> 02:29:18.16
I think I hand-cycled 16 miles, ran 10.

2372
02:29:18.16 --> 02:29:23.40
And just getting out there like that and getting a sense of my athleticism, gaining a sense

2373
02:29:23.40 --> 02:29:29.32
of my physicality was huge to realize that I can still be an athlete.

2374
02:29:29.32 --> 02:29:31.80
There's this whole world of adaptive sports.

2375
02:29:31.80 --> 02:29:35.04
Just about anything that you want to do or had done.

2376
02:29:35.04 --> 02:29:38.76
You can do maybe in a different, maybe it's going to take your upper body to do it.

2377
02:29:38.76 --> 02:29:42.48
Or maybe you're going to be doing a prosthetic, but that you can be an athlete.

2378
02:29:42.48 --> 02:29:47.44
And then I heard about this thing called the Paralympics.

2379
02:29:47.44 --> 02:29:49.72
And then that was very intriguing to me.

2380
02:29:49.72 --> 02:29:51.72
What did you heard about it?

2381
02:29:51.72 --> 02:29:56.08
Oh, I heard it's basically the Olympics for people with physical disabilities.

2382
02:29:56.08 --> 02:29:58.08
And it's not the special Olympics.

2383
02:29:58.08 --> 02:29:59.08
It's different.

2384
02:29:59.08 --> 02:30:01.04
It's under the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee.

2385
02:30:01.04 --> 02:30:05.52
It is competitive.

2386
02:30:05.52 --> 02:30:07.72
It's difficult.

2387
02:30:07.72 --> 02:30:09.88
You'll get world-class coaching.

2388
02:30:09.88 --> 02:30:13.08
You can represent the country overseas.

2389
02:30:13.08 --> 02:30:16.72
It is a direct representation of the United States overseas.

2390
02:30:16.72 --> 02:30:18.52
And you can be part of a team.

2391
02:30:18.52 --> 02:30:20.40
There's all these different sports out there.

2392
02:30:20.40 --> 02:30:21.40
There's summer.

2393
02:30:21.40 --> 02:30:22.96
It's just like the Olympics.

2394
02:30:22.96 --> 02:30:27.68
Did you have any inkling of what you'd be trying to do in there?

2395
02:30:27.68 --> 02:30:30.88
I was thinking something along the lines of running or cycling.

2396
02:30:30.88 --> 02:30:35.92
I actually, there was a recruiter or liaison at Walter Reed.

2397
02:30:35.92 --> 02:30:40.16
The clear place to find athletes for the Paralympic Committee.

2398
02:30:40.16 --> 02:30:48.28
Walter Reed, you got a young, motivated soldier's Marines troops that are looking to get

2399
02:30:48.28 --> 02:30:49.28
after it.

2400
02:30:49.28 --> 02:30:50.28
Yeah.

2401
02:30:50.28 --> 02:30:51.28
Yeah.

2402
02:30:51.28 --> 02:30:52.28
And so they had a rock.

2403
02:30:52.28 --> 02:30:53.28
They had a rock.

2404
02:30:53.28 --> 02:30:54.28
Yeah, yeah.

2405
02:30:54.28 --> 02:30:58.12
I was injured before Rob and maybe a year before something like that.

2406
02:30:58.12 --> 02:30:59.12
Something like that.

2407
02:30:59.12 --> 02:31:02.60
This environment fed off each other.

2408
02:31:02.60 --> 02:31:08.28
Rob was just so fired up to get back after it.

2409
02:31:08.28 --> 02:31:15.28
And there's some people not maybe being an athlete wasn't their thing.

2410
02:31:15.28 --> 02:31:17.72
Some people want to get into a career.

2411
02:31:17.72 --> 02:31:20.92
Some people are struggling.

2412
02:31:20.92 --> 02:31:27.52
Some like Rob were just doing all sorts of impressive stuff.

2413
02:31:27.52 --> 02:31:34.84
And I think you hear about someone before you, that was a double empathy above the knee.

2414
02:31:34.84 --> 02:31:36.76
They did this and that.

2415
02:31:36.76 --> 02:31:38.36
This is possible.

2416
02:31:38.36 --> 02:31:41.52
And then it created, there's a competitive environment.

2417
02:31:41.52 --> 02:31:44.16
Rob is a little bit after saw me running.

2418
02:31:44.16 --> 02:31:47.48
And then he's like, I'm going to run, I'm going to run faster than Dan.

2419
02:31:47.48 --> 02:31:49.48
This kind of thing.

2420
02:31:49.48 --> 02:31:51.04
It just was a good environment.

2421
02:31:51.04 --> 02:31:55.60
It makes me think if I had gone through this in a vacuum and a bubble would the outcome

2422
02:31:55.60 --> 02:31:57.60
have been the same?

2423
02:31:57.60 --> 02:31:58.60
Perhaps.

2424
02:31:58.60 --> 02:32:03.84
I think it helped though to have that sense of perspective and to see what other people

2425
02:32:03.84 --> 02:32:05.84
are dealing with.

2426
02:32:05.84 --> 02:32:13.60
And in some cases, really struggling with.

2427
02:32:13.60 --> 02:32:22.16
But military medicine can keep people alive these days in ways just not possible.

2428
02:32:22.16 --> 02:32:28.84
And so you're seeing, I mean, it was not uncommon to see triple amputees quadruple amputees.

2429
02:32:28.84 --> 02:32:39.44
And I think there was a bond in that environment that transcended your service, your rank,

2430
02:32:39.44 --> 02:32:46.000
what you did in your service that is different than the bond I had in the teams.

2431
02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.52
But it was very special.

2432
02:32:48.52 --> 02:32:53.60
So the recruiters come from the parallel Olympics and they come scoping out at Walter Reed,

2433
02:32:53.60 --> 02:32:56.64
looking for some motivated troops and want to get up.

2434
02:32:56.64 --> 02:33:00.04
And one of these guys is to introduce himself to you or something?

2435
02:33:00.04 --> 02:33:04.64
One of the recruiters, she asked, do I want to go to San Diego for sports camp?

2436
02:33:04.64 --> 02:33:06.24
Yep, that sounds awesome.

2437
02:33:06.24 --> 02:33:07.24
Tripped to San Diego.

2438
02:33:07.24 --> 02:33:12.16
And I go out there, not really expecting anything, but really it's a tripped to San Diego.

2439
02:33:12.16 --> 02:33:15.08
I'll get to do some adapt to sports sounds good.

2440
02:33:15.08 --> 02:33:19.40
And the coach is from the Paralympic Nordic Schee Team, that's Cross-Country Scheeing,

2441
02:33:19.40 --> 02:33:24.68
and byath on approach me and hey, you ever thought about doing byath on?

2442
02:33:24.68 --> 02:33:26.56
I thought that was running and swimming.

2443
02:33:26.56 --> 02:33:30.56
It's Cross-Country Scheeing with target shooting.

2444
02:33:30.56 --> 02:33:32.32
That sounds pretty cool.

2445
02:33:32.32 --> 02:33:38.44
Well, they had like a indoor ski irg there and like a little laser shooting station.

2446
02:33:38.44 --> 02:33:41.64
Okay, this isn't on snow, but do you want to come to snow a few months?

2447
02:33:41.64 --> 02:33:42.64
It's August, right?

2448
02:33:42.64 --> 02:33:47.40
In November, late November, West Yellowstone, Montana, camp.

2449
02:33:47.40 --> 02:33:48.40
Okay, I'm there.

2450
02:33:48.40 --> 02:33:49.84
Now I still had a colossal me bag.

2451
02:33:49.84 --> 02:33:50.84
I wasn't done with surgery.

2452
02:33:50.84 --> 02:33:56.04
The one major surgery I still had remaining was to take away the colossal me bag.

2453
02:33:56.04 --> 02:33:59.16
And this sounds awesome.

2454
02:33:59.16 --> 02:34:00.64
I go out to West Yellowstone.

2455
02:34:00.64 --> 02:34:04.04
I don't know how to dress as an amputee with my stumps.

2456
02:34:04.04 --> 02:34:06.28
I don't know how to, I don't know the clothing.

2457
02:34:06.28 --> 02:34:07.60
I don't have all that.

2458
02:34:07.60 --> 02:34:12.60
I mean, this thing called a sit ski, which now, I mean, now at a higher level, if

2459
02:34:12.60 --> 02:34:14.36
it's all carbon fiber, it's custom fit to me.

2460
02:34:14.36 --> 02:34:19.60
It's lightweight, strong, but back then it was like a lawn chair on the two skis.

2461
02:34:19.60 --> 02:34:23.52
And it was not a not an athletic device.

2462
02:34:23.52 --> 02:34:26.36
But okay, cross-country skiing, all you got is two poles.

2463
02:34:26.36 --> 02:34:32.08
You got to use your upper body, your arms, your core, your back.

2464
02:34:32.08 --> 02:34:34.76
And you don't get to use your lower body.

2465
02:34:34.76 --> 02:34:36.04
You're strapped into this thing.

2466
02:34:36.04 --> 02:34:37.04
How are you going to stop?

2467
02:34:37.04 --> 02:34:38.64
How are you going to turn?

2468
02:34:38.64 --> 02:34:39.64
Okay, we've figured this out.

2469
02:34:39.64 --> 02:34:44.52
My future teammates are just racing by me, because I, wow, they're fast.

2470
02:34:44.52 --> 02:34:48.44
I don't know if I could ever get to that level, but at a minimum, just being outside,

2471
02:34:48.44 --> 02:34:52.32
West Yellowstone Montana is one of my favorite places across country ski.

2472
02:34:52.32 --> 02:34:54.48
It's near big skis.

2473
02:34:54.48 --> 02:34:55.48
Just pine trees.

2474
02:34:55.48 --> 02:34:57.64
You feel like you're in the woods.

2475
02:34:57.64 --> 02:34:59.24
Yeah, the trails are machine-grumed.

2476
02:34:59.24 --> 02:35:00.88
But once you're out, it's quiet.

2477
02:35:00.88 --> 02:35:03.44
There was days, we were just getting, it was a good snow.

2478
02:35:03.44 --> 02:35:05.44
This is late in the Vembers, not always consistent.

2479
02:35:05.44 --> 02:35:10.28
But that you're fortunate for me, because if it would have been a dry year in canceled

2480
02:35:10.28 --> 02:35:15.24
who knows, but it was dumping snow, which isn't always good for cross country skiing when

2481
02:35:15.24 --> 02:35:16.88
you're trying to power through with your poles.

2482
02:35:16.88 --> 02:35:22.16
But more than anything, I just had this connection with nature.

2483
02:35:22.16 --> 02:35:23.16
That was so important.

2484
02:35:23.16 --> 02:35:25.04
I'd been running on the prosthetics.

2485
02:35:25.04 --> 02:35:26.16
I wasn't trail running.

2486
02:35:26.16 --> 02:35:32.76
I was running out in the woods, hand cycling a little bit in DC to the car's honk at you.

2487
02:35:32.76 --> 02:35:34.20
It's not a feeling of nature.

2488
02:35:34.20 --> 02:35:36.36
This was just different.

2489
02:35:36.36 --> 02:35:40.12
I really just wanted to keep doing it.

2490
02:35:40.12 --> 02:35:41.12
So what happens?

2491
02:35:41.12 --> 02:35:42.12
What's the course?

2492
02:35:42.12 --> 02:35:43.12
Is that it?

2493
02:35:43.12 --> 02:35:46.28
That ends up being what your first competitive sport is.

2494
02:35:46.28 --> 02:35:47.48
Was that right?

2495
02:35:47.48 --> 02:35:50.32
It's all I've done in the Paralympics.

2496
02:35:50.32 --> 02:35:53.68
For me, it started because I just wanted to be in the woods.

2497
02:35:53.68 --> 02:35:59.96
Then it was like, you could actually start doing this full-time training and get better.

2498
02:35:59.96 --> 02:36:01.32
Just see where you can go.

2499
02:36:01.32 --> 02:36:04.88
You'll make a Paralympic team get to go to the Paralympic winter games.

2500
02:36:04.88 --> 02:36:05.88
I'm still an active duty.

2501
02:36:05.88 --> 02:36:06.88
I'm still in the hospital.

2502
02:36:06.88 --> 02:36:07.88
I saw this surgery.

2503
02:36:07.88 --> 02:36:08.88
I got through the surgery.

2504
02:36:08.88 --> 02:36:09.88
Big recovery.

2505
02:36:09.88 --> 02:36:16.20
They cut open my core again to reconnect my intestinal system.

2506
02:36:16.20 --> 02:36:18.52
I still have orders at Walter Reed.

2507
02:36:18.52 --> 02:36:21.04
I got to get out of the Navy.

2508
02:36:21.04 --> 02:36:23.24
I had a conversation with the head seal Admiral.

2509
02:36:23.24 --> 02:36:26.40
He was like, well, we'll support you if you want to do this.

2510
02:36:26.40 --> 02:36:27.88
Three years of training.

2511
02:36:27.88 --> 02:36:32.88
I'm going to be a team for the Sochi Paralympics, a sign to you to Fort Carson Colorado,

2512
02:36:32.88 --> 02:36:34.36
10 Special Forces Group.

2513
02:36:34.36 --> 02:36:36.08
I'll be training up in Winter Park.

2514
02:36:36.08 --> 02:36:40.52
I had met a coach up there when I park and they got snow.

2515
02:36:40.52 --> 02:36:41.96
They got training area.

2516
02:36:41.96 --> 02:36:43.52
So I took orders.

2517
02:36:43.52 --> 02:36:48.80
I mean, again, I'm very grateful to the NSW community for doing that.

2518
02:36:48.80 --> 02:36:53.52
For me, I could have gotten out, but there was something special about still being in

2519
02:36:53.52 --> 02:36:57.84
and still training for this sport to go represent the country.

2520
02:36:57.84 --> 02:37:03.92
And so the way I saw it, I have orders to move out to Colorado into train.

2521
02:37:03.92 --> 02:37:06.72
I'm going to train and train and train.

2522
02:37:06.72 --> 02:37:12.48
I probably trained a little bit too much and maybe over-trained in that desire to kind

2523
02:37:12.48 --> 02:37:17.92
of work through my injury and to show that I've overcome it.

2524
02:37:17.92 --> 02:37:20.56
That's what that was for the Sochi.

2525
02:37:20.56 --> 02:37:21.76
So how did that end up going?

2526
02:37:21.76 --> 02:37:23.28
Yeah, I showed up there.

2527
02:37:23.28 --> 02:37:27.68
A newer athlete, I've been doing the sport for three years, living in training in Colorado

2528
02:37:27.68 --> 02:37:36.40
and now that I look back all that time, I'm just wondering why did someone who lost their

2529
02:37:36.40 --> 02:37:39.64
legs and within two years move out to Colorado, didn't know anybody.

2530
02:37:39.64 --> 02:37:45.60
I knew that local coach, just go straight and support that like 98% of my training was by

2531
02:37:45.60 --> 02:37:46.60
myself.

2532
02:37:46.60 --> 02:37:47.60
How are those?

2533
02:37:47.60 --> 02:37:51.60
In the off-season cross-country skiers, roller ski, I had this mountain board apparatus,

2534
02:37:51.60 --> 02:37:57.32
so I'm on the dirt roads out there and just training and training and training and probably

2535
02:37:57.32 --> 02:38:00.52
working through some things, but it just felt good to be an athlete.

2536
02:38:00.52 --> 02:38:07.40
I could train for this sport, be part of a team, follow a training, plan C progress, set

2537
02:38:07.40 --> 02:38:12.44
long-term goals, work towards those long-term goals, put the skills and the training

2538
02:38:12.44 --> 02:38:18.44
of the test overseas, represent the United States if I can make a parallel pick team.

2539
02:38:18.44 --> 02:38:24.40
This seemed like a logical thing to do for me coming out of my time and the teams in the

2540
02:38:24.40 --> 02:38:25.40
service.

2541
02:38:25.40 --> 02:38:29.92
But I'm still in the service and I'm representing the Navy and all of that.

2542
02:38:29.92 --> 02:38:31.52
I put a little bit of pressure on myself.

2543
02:38:31.52 --> 02:38:37.80
I showed up at the, I did make the team for Sochi and we know now in retrospect that Russians

2544
02:38:37.80 --> 02:38:41.16
were doing performance enhancing drugs.

2545
02:38:41.16 --> 02:38:46.000
That's not necessarily verifiable, but I think plenty of people have come out and said

2546
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.36
that that was happening.

2547
02:38:47.36 --> 02:38:53.08
Don't have the sample, but there was a very tough competition.

2548
02:38:53.08 --> 02:38:55.76
The cross-country skiing is a tough sport.

2549
02:38:55.76 --> 02:39:00.44
The distance is range from 15, 18 kilometer races down to sprints, but what, what, what

2550
02:39:00.44 --> 02:39:02.28
did you do?

2551
02:39:02.28 --> 02:39:06.80
I did six races at the Sochi Games and that's the standard.

2552
02:39:06.80 --> 02:39:15.08
So the longest, so it would have been six races in cross-country three, 15 kilometer, 10 kilometer,

2553
02:39:15.08 --> 02:39:16.92
and then 800 meter sprint.

2554
02:39:16.92 --> 02:39:22.28
And then in Biaflan, 15 kilometer, 12.5 kilometer, 7.5 kilometer.

2555
02:39:22.28 --> 02:39:24.44
These six races happen in like eight days.

2556
02:39:24.44 --> 02:39:25.44
It's intense.

2557
02:39:25.44 --> 02:39:27.56
You don't get a lot of recovery.

2558
02:39:27.56 --> 02:39:32.20
And I was kind of in the tenth, 12th place area, 14th.

2559
02:39:32.20 --> 02:39:36.000
The fields aren't as deep as in the Olympics, but they're still very competitive.

2560
02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:41.44
And I made the sprint final that one and got six place and six out of six on the

2561
02:39:41.44 --> 02:39:43.36
sprint final, but made it to the final.

2562
02:39:43.36 --> 02:39:48.48
I exceeded Sochi to be honest a little bit disappointed because I think I had put too much

2563
02:39:48.48 --> 02:39:50.28
pressure on myself.

2564
02:39:50.28 --> 02:39:51.84
And you think you're over trying to?

2565
02:39:51.84 --> 02:39:52.84
I think so.

2566
02:39:52.84 --> 02:39:56.60
I was living at very high altitude and winter park Colorado, Frasier Colorado, living

2567
02:39:56.60 --> 02:39:58.40
at a 8700 feet.

2568
02:39:58.40 --> 02:40:01.28
It's altitude has pros and cons.

2569
02:40:01.28 --> 02:40:03.40
A lot of people think it's a win-win.

2570
02:40:03.40 --> 02:40:08.40
You're up at high altitude, training, front and front sport, but you do develop the red

2571
02:40:08.40 --> 02:40:14.40
blood cells that improved efficiency in your transportation system internally.

2572
02:40:14.40 --> 02:40:19.36
But you cannot train to the extent that you can at sea level.

2573
02:40:19.36 --> 02:40:25.04
And so your neuromuscular system is not performing at the...

2574
02:40:25.04 --> 02:40:26.60
So what's the best to do both?

2575
02:40:26.60 --> 02:40:27.60
Yeah.

2576
02:40:27.60 --> 02:40:28.60
Like the model to do down.

2577
02:40:28.60 --> 02:40:31.000
Yeah, the model is live-high train low.

2578
02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.24
If you have limited funds, you would be at sea level.

2579
02:40:35.24 --> 02:40:39.000
In this case, where there's snow, but low altitude and you would let you would pressure

2580
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
as your house to be at like 10,000 feet.

2581
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.64
I'm assuming you're going to recover.

2582
02:40:42.64 --> 02:40:43.64
You step up the door.

2583
02:40:43.64 --> 02:40:44.64
Yeah.

2584
02:40:44.64 --> 02:40:45.64
Yeah.

2585
02:40:45.64 --> 02:40:49.000
And then when you spend a lot of time in your house and you go out and then you're

2586
02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:53.96
at sea level, so you have the red blood cells from the altitude inside.

2587
02:40:53.96 --> 02:40:58.56
And then now you're training fast and hard at a higher tempo, higher intensity than you

2588
02:40:58.56 --> 02:41:00.04
can at altitude.

2589
02:41:00.04 --> 02:41:01.60
So you make it to the Olympics.

2590
02:41:01.60 --> 02:41:06.60
You come in 6th, 12th, 10th, whatever, and you're all kind of pissed at yourself because

2591
02:41:06.60 --> 02:41:07.60
you think...

2592
02:41:07.60 --> 02:41:11.08
Well, I think you know, as you look back, I mean, what was I expecting?

2593
02:41:11.08 --> 02:41:12.08
I was new.

2594
02:41:12.08 --> 02:41:14.32
I mean, you don't want to just be given to you.

2595
02:41:14.32 --> 02:41:15.32
Yeah.

2596
02:41:15.32 --> 02:41:20.36
Honestly, there's not as much reward if it was easy, but the other thing is I think

2597
02:41:20.36 --> 02:41:26.72
I put too much focus on the end result that there's actually a different focus.

2598
02:41:26.72 --> 02:41:30.80
The focus should just be on the process.

2599
02:41:30.80 --> 02:41:35.68
Training, execution of the training plan, modifying as necessary, making adjustments at

2600
02:41:35.68 --> 02:41:40.16
the end of every season based on what went well and what could have gone better.

2601
02:41:40.16 --> 02:41:45.28
And that if I can make some changes to equipment, make some changes where I'm living,

2602
02:41:45.28 --> 02:41:48.84
I moved to New England.

2603
02:41:48.84 --> 02:41:57.76
So I'd be at a lower altitude and that if I can execute the process of training and preparation

2604
02:41:57.76 --> 02:42:05.72
that, and then, of course, on race day, go a dig deep, go as hard as I can, in a smart way.

2605
02:42:05.72 --> 02:42:09.48
At that point, you gotta be happy with what happens at that point.

2606
02:42:09.48 --> 02:42:13.80
So I ended up training for the next cycle and these are four-year cycles.

2607
02:42:13.80 --> 02:42:15.72
You moved to New England, go to school, right?

2608
02:42:15.72 --> 02:42:22.80
Yeah, I used my GI Bill and I just, I had some friends from the teams who had gone to the

2609
02:42:22.80 --> 02:42:25.76
Kennedy School of the Government and wanted to go there.

2610
02:42:25.76 --> 02:42:26.76
It was one of your programs.

2611
02:42:26.76 --> 02:42:28.76
I was very much still training.

2612
02:42:28.76 --> 02:42:33.28
A little skeptical whether I could get in that, the training hours that I needed.

2613
02:42:33.28 --> 02:42:37.24
I didn't know how demanding the academic program was going to be, but I found that with

2614
02:42:37.24 --> 02:42:42.28
discipline and time management, go to bed early, wake up at my training zone, be 7 a.m.

2615
02:42:42.28 --> 02:42:45.60
Go to class at 10, rest of the day.

2616
02:42:45.60 --> 02:42:46.60
And then recover.

2617
02:42:46.60 --> 02:42:53.72
And I often call a Rado prior to in the train up for the 2014 games through boredom and through

2618
02:42:53.72 --> 02:42:57.92
just a desire to be training and thinking, this is like a bud's mental.

2619
02:42:57.92 --> 02:42:58.92
More as better.

2620
02:42:58.92 --> 02:42:59.92
Yeah, more as better.

2621
02:42:59.92 --> 02:43:00.92
Train twice is hard.

2622
02:43:00.92 --> 02:43:01.92
You're going to get twice as fast.

2623
02:43:01.92 --> 02:43:03.92
It doesn't really work that way.

2624
02:43:03.92 --> 02:43:04.92
You don't.

2625
02:43:04.92 --> 02:43:05.92
Yeah.

2626
02:43:05.92 --> 02:43:10.52
If you go there's days, you training has to be hard.

2627
02:43:10.52 --> 02:43:13.28
But then you have to give, you obviously know that way.

2628
02:43:13.28 --> 02:43:15.28
Well, I'm actually, obviously, may not know this.

2629
02:43:15.28 --> 02:43:17.68
I'm not really the worst.

2630
02:43:17.68 --> 02:43:18.68
Yeah.

2631
02:43:18.68 --> 02:43:22.92
Echo is in full support of heavy rest.

2632
02:43:22.92 --> 02:43:23.92
Make sure to recover.

2633
02:43:23.92 --> 02:43:24.92
Yeah.

2634
02:43:24.92 --> 02:43:29.84
So when you're going to school, you're training basically two hours a day.

2635
02:43:29.84 --> 02:43:30.84
Yeah.

2636
02:43:30.84 --> 02:43:34.28
And we're as in Colorado, I've been training like three to four at high altitude, not giving

2637
02:43:34.28 --> 02:43:36.36
myself the recovery.

2638
02:43:36.36 --> 02:43:38.16
And then you start getting dialed in.

2639
02:43:38.16 --> 02:43:39.40
You got a good coach out there.

2640
02:43:39.40 --> 02:43:41.08
It's helping you get dialed in on all of us.

2641
02:43:41.08 --> 02:43:43.20
Well, a physiologist and it was a remote coaching.

2642
02:43:43.20 --> 02:43:48.04
But yeah, I mean, looking like uploading workouts, getting feedback.

2643
02:43:48.04 --> 02:43:54.60
And then in the winter, I was exploring, you know, okay, because it was 20.

2644
02:43:54.60 --> 02:43:57.32
The first year I skeed, I did not skeet with the team.

2645
02:43:57.32 --> 02:44:01.20
The next year, I needed to skeet with the team internationally to be able to qualify for

2646
02:44:01.20 --> 02:44:03.72
the games in 2018.

2647
02:44:03.72 --> 02:44:06.36
And I was working out, okay, like I can train up in Vermont.

2648
02:44:06.36 --> 02:44:10.60
There's a really good center at Craftsbury Vermont from Nordic skiing.

2649
02:44:10.60 --> 02:44:12.68
And there's a coach who will help me with biathlon.

2650
02:44:12.68 --> 02:44:16.84
I can drive there if I take, you know, compress classes to be like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

2651
02:44:16.84 --> 02:44:21.16
I can drive up Thursday afternoon, train Friday Saturday, Sunday Monday.

2652
02:44:21.16 --> 02:44:23.000
And then there's a ski check in Boston.

2653
02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I can't do biathlon there.

2654
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.28
But if there's a lot, a ski check.

2655
02:44:25.28 --> 02:44:27.28
I'm sorry, ski track.

2656
02:44:27.28 --> 02:44:28.28
Oh, okay.

2657
02:44:28.28 --> 02:44:29.28
Yeah.

2658
02:44:29.28 --> 02:44:31.56
They make snow from the Charles River.

2659
02:44:31.56 --> 02:44:34.000
And it's about a, like, 15 minute drive.

2660
02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.04
So I can do a workout there.

2661
02:44:36.04 --> 02:44:38.32
And I think this is possible.

2662
02:44:38.32 --> 02:44:42.12
So I think I can be a student and train.

2663
02:44:42.12 --> 02:44:43.28
And how hard was school?

2664
02:44:43.28 --> 02:44:45.28
Was, was, was, was they pushing you hard?

2665
02:44:45.28 --> 02:44:47.12
It was difficult if you did all the work.

2666
02:44:47.12 --> 02:44:48.56
And if you did all the reading.

2667
02:44:48.56 --> 02:44:52.40
And I mean, I don't know many people that can actually do all the reading.

2668
02:44:52.40 --> 02:44:54.24
I was also training as a full-time athlete.

2669
02:44:54.24 --> 02:44:55.24
Yeah.

2670
02:44:55.24 --> 02:44:56.96
If you got it done is what I'm doing.

2671
02:44:56.96 --> 02:44:57.96
Yeah.

2672
02:44:57.96 --> 02:44:58.96
I got it done.

2673
02:44:58.96 --> 02:44:59.96
And I got good grades.

2674
02:44:59.96 --> 02:45:03.24
I think, I think they're not in the business of trying to separate people.

2675
02:45:03.24 --> 02:45:04.96
Otherwise, you know, you're there.

2676
02:45:04.96 --> 02:45:08.000
But then you go to, then you go to divinity school as well.

2677
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.16
So I was, I don't know.

2678
02:45:09.16 --> 02:45:13.32
I had gone to the Kennedy School and I really liked being in class and learning from

2679
02:45:13.32 --> 02:45:15.80
people and seeing new ideas.

2680
02:45:15.80 --> 02:45:16.80
You don't have to agree with them.

2681
02:45:16.80 --> 02:45:19.68
But it's, I gone to a military school for college.

2682
02:45:19.68 --> 02:45:21.92
I just thought this is, this is a good opportunity.

2683
02:45:21.92 --> 02:45:26.56
And I met some students from the Divinity School and they said, it's not, it's not what

2684
02:45:26.56 --> 02:45:27.56
it sounds like.

2685
02:45:27.56 --> 02:45:29.56
You can go to the ministry if you're inclined.

2686
02:45:29.56 --> 02:45:34.32
But this is another program.

2687
02:45:34.32 --> 02:45:37.24
It's just an academic study of religion or questions that religion is trying to answer.

2688
02:45:37.24 --> 02:45:40.16
And so I thought, well, I'll apply.

2689
02:45:40.16 --> 02:45:42.28
And I was accepted.

2690
02:45:42.28 --> 02:45:44.68
I studied ethics there.

2691
02:45:44.68 --> 02:45:48.68
And I got to take some classes through electives.

2692
02:45:48.68 --> 02:45:51.52
This was a very, a wonderful program in the sense that it was broad.

2693
02:45:51.52 --> 02:45:53.52
And I can kind of just take whatever interested me.

2694
02:45:53.52 --> 02:45:55.000
I took some classes on Buddhism.

2695
02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:02.000
And I'm not a Buddhist, but there was something in my exposure to that way of thinking

2696
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:11.84
that really resonated in the athlete in me, this idea that life is suffering and I can

2697
02:46:11.84 --> 02:46:12.84
identify with that.

2698
02:46:12.84 --> 02:46:19.24
Even when you are happy, you're suffering because you know that that happiness is not

2699
02:46:19.24 --> 02:46:20.84
permanent.

2700
02:46:20.84 --> 02:46:29.76
And that there's a way to, that this suffering comes ultimately from our desire and craving

2701
02:46:29.76 --> 02:46:34.56
for happiness, that there's a way to end this suffering.

2702
02:46:34.56 --> 02:46:35.96
And that is through a process.

2703
02:46:35.96 --> 02:46:38.96
But the process can involve mindfulness and meditation.

2704
02:46:38.96 --> 02:46:41.68
And so I was exposed to that.

2705
02:46:41.68 --> 02:46:45.28
And I think when I was in the teams, I would have scoffed at this.

2706
02:46:45.28 --> 02:46:50.76
But I was thinking, now I'm of the point where I am trying to get

2707
02:46:50.76 --> 02:46:55.24
every tenth of a percent of performance that I can.

2708
02:46:55.24 --> 02:47:01.16
And if this was the difference between getting fourth place and getting third, and I didn't

2709
02:47:01.16 --> 02:47:07.44
do it, well, I just at least want to, I tried everything that could help me be a better human

2710
02:47:07.44 --> 02:47:08.44
a better athlete.

2711
02:47:08.44 --> 02:47:12.84
And in Biaflan, the reality is you're skiing hard.

2712
02:47:12.84 --> 02:47:17.96
And you have to come into the range and you have to place five shots precisely with other

2713
02:47:17.96 --> 02:47:24.96
athletes next to you shooting and an answer saying something, a crowd, your heart beating,

2714
02:47:24.96 --> 02:47:31.16
maybe numb fingers from the cold pressure, knowing you need to hit the shots, that if

2715
02:47:31.16 --> 02:47:37.64
you can cultivate an ability to be aware of your mind and be aware more quickly when

2716
02:47:37.64 --> 02:47:42.96
your mind has drifted away from the task right in front of you, that that could be a competitive

2717
02:47:42.96 --> 02:47:49.60
advantage, not to mention cultivating this ability to just focus and to focus on your breath

2718
02:47:49.60 --> 02:47:53.36
or to have the ability to through breathing, re-center yourself.

2719
02:47:53.36 --> 02:48:00.04
I think that this is actually something that I could have benefited from, highly when I was

2720
02:48:00.04 --> 02:48:06.32
in the teams, the ability to be aware of where your mind is.

2721
02:48:06.32 --> 02:48:09.80
It's almost like you're developing an outside view of your mind and you can see when

2722
02:48:09.80 --> 02:48:10.92
it's gone away.

2723
02:48:10.92 --> 02:48:15.84
And so I started developing this kind of practice just through some classes I took.

2724
02:48:15.84 --> 02:48:20.56
And that kind of exposure was exactly why I did the Divinity School program.

2725
02:48:20.56 --> 02:48:26.68
You know, I've been running into a lot of that stuff, you know, in the book Leadership

2726
02:48:26.68 --> 02:48:32.74
Strategy and Tactics I talk about how my very first-putton, I was, we were doing gas oil

2727
02:48:32.74 --> 02:48:38.12
platforms and I basically, we were online, no one's making a call and I kind of step back

2728
02:48:38.12 --> 02:48:43.72
and looked around and made a call and got praised for it.

2729
02:48:43.72 --> 02:48:48.40
You know, it's kind of expecting us a new guy to get told shut up, but it was like the

2730
02:48:48.40 --> 02:48:53.52
initial idea in my head of taking a step back and attaching and being in a position mentally

2731
02:48:53.52 --> 02:48:57.60
where you're looking around and you're not in the problem, but you're outside the problem.

2732
02:48:57.60 --> 02:48:59.76
And that was really beneficial to me.

2733
02:48:59.76 --> 02:49:06.04
And then, you know, I've come to find out, like, for instance, when you take a step back

2734
02:49:06.04 --> 02:49:11.92
and you, well, when you're, when you're feel division opens up more broadly, it relaxes

2735
02:49:11.92 --> 02:49:12.92
you.

2736
02:49:12.92 --> 02:49:15.64
That's why when you go to the ocean and you look at the sunset, you feel relaxed.

2737
02:49:15.64 --> 02:49:19.20
That's why when you stand on a mountain top and you look out over, you know, vast span

2738
02:49:19.20 --> 02:49:21.56
of land, you feel more relaxed.

2739
02:49:21.56 --> 02:49:27.44
Those things, those are physiological things that happen because as a, as a animal, if there

2740
02:49:27.44 --> 02:49:32.24
is a movement in the jungle, like a tiger, you need to focus on that and it amps up your heart

2741
02:49:32.24 --> 02:49:36.88
rate and it gets you ready to fight, put your adrenaline in your system, yet the opposite

2742
02:49:36.88 --> 02:49:42.08
of that is when you, when you open up your field of vision, it becomes, it relaxes you.

2743
02:49:42.08 --> 02:49:47.04
So kind of unintentionally, for me, as a young seal, I figured out, hey, if I take a step

2744
02:49:47.04 --> 02:49:49.52
back and look around, I'm more relaxed.

2745
02:49:49.52 --> 02:49:52.76
It was more of a byproduct, wasn't I was doing it two-lacks.

2746
02:49:52.76 --> 02:49:56.92
And then the other thing that figured out was like, anytime you'd hear someone panicking

2747
02:49:56.92 --> 02:50:01.000
on the radio, screaming, you're like, I want to know what any people over here and whatever.

2748
02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.88
And so you'd make fun of that guy, we'd make fun of those people.

2749
02:50:03.88 --> 02:50:07.84
And so I would always, when I was going to keep up my radio, I'd take a breath and it turns

2750
02:50:07.84 --> 02:50:11.28
out that when you take a breath, that also comes to go.

2751
02:50:11.28 --> 02:50:17.08
So I kind of stumbled into these things and other things throughout my career that now

2752
02:50:17.08 --> 02:50:22.56
when I either learn about the physiological, the physiological things that happen in our

2753
02:50:22.56 --> 02:50:29.56
body that also people use things like meditation to drive these same physiological things,

2754
02:50:29.56 --> 02:50:33.44
I kind of got lucky and stumbled upon them.

2755
02:50:33.44 --> 02:50:38.64
And just, you know, now I'm sort of starting to put two and two together now, as I get

2756
02:50:38.64 --> 02:50:41.000
older and learn more about the world.

2757
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:47.84
These physiological things that I sort of stumbled upon, people go out and seek and figure

2758
02:50:47.84 --> 02:50:48.84
out.

2759
02:50:48.84 --> 02:50:49.84
And you know, same thing with like, you did to it.

2760
02:50:49.84 --> 02:50:52.04
If you lose your temperature in your jiu-jitsu, you're going to lose.

2761
02:50:52.04 --> 02:50:53.56
Like, if you start getting mad, you're going to lose.

2762
02:50:53.56 --> 02:50:56.44
So I realized, how do I keep that in check?

2763
02:50:56.44 --> 02:51:00.88
Oh, you know, same thing, take a breath, don't let don't get caught up in the moment.

2764
02:51:00.88 --> 02:51:07.84
And I got very, very lucky to kind of stumble on these things in my career so that by

2765
02:51:07.84 --> 02:51:11.84
the time I was, you know, you know, I was an opportune commander and a task into commander.

2766
02:51:11.84 --> 02:51:14.76
I was like, oh, yeah, take a step back, look around and make sure you don't get caught

2767
02:51:14.76 --> 02:51:16.64
up in the problem.

2768
02:51:16.64 --> 02:51:17.64
Interesting stuff.

2769
02:51:17.64 --> 02:51:19.80
Yeah, I think this is an opportunity.

2770
02:51:19.80 --> 02:51:27.16
For me, it would be 10, 12 minutes a day and I just get in a quiet space, close my eyes

2771
02:51:27.16 --> 02:51:28.84
and try to follow my breath.

2772
02:51:28.84 --> 02:51:35.72
And I can use this opportunity to visualize a race, how I want the race to go.

2773
02:51:35.72 --> 02:51:41.56
But also, some things that might go wrong during the race and how I want to react, miss

2774
02:51:41.56 --> 02:51:45.16
a shot, sometimes the next shot is getting another shot.

2775
02:51:45.16 --> 02:51:47.12
You take five shots on five targets.

2776
02:51:47.12 --> 02:51:48.60
And you only get five shots.

2777
02:51:48.60 --> 02:51:49.60
Five shots.

2778
02:51:49.60 --> 02:51:53.000
If you miss it's a penalty lap or one minute penalty depending on the length of the

2779
02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
race.

2780
02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.20
And you do either two or four stages so that's either a 10 shot total race or a 20 shot

2781
02:51:59.20 --> 02:52:01.000
total race.

2782
02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:05.60
And I've noticed in the past that if I have a miss, the next shot is almost like an

2783
02:52:05.60 --> 02:52:10.76
anger shot or a frustration shot instead of, so as an example, this could be an opportunity

2784
02:52:10.76 --> 02:52:13.04
to visualize missing a shot.

2785
02:52:13.04 --> 02:52:16.92
That doesn't mean I'm, it's going to predispose me to miss that shot.

2786
02:52:16.92 --> 02:52:22.44
It just means I can work on having the response to a miss in the event that that happens.

2787
02:52:22.44 --> 02:52:27.52
And the kind of response I want to have, which is, it's just the next shot.

2788
02:52:27.52 --> 02:52:28.52
It's one shot at a time.

2789
02:52:28.52 --> 02:52:30.12
It's just taking the next shot.

2790
02:52:30.12 --> 02:52:36.20
But it's also a chance to track my breathing, which is very critical in shooting, the timing

2791
02:52:36.20 --> 02:52:39.68
of your breath with the trigger squeeze and sideline.

2792
02:52:39.68 --> 02:52:46.36
So what you notice is that your brain just goes all over the place when you're trying

2793
02:52:46.36 --> 02:52:50.84
to focus in a calm, you are only doing that.

2794
02:52:50.84 --> 02:52:55.40
You don't need to eat right now, you don't need to drink, you don't need to sleep, you

2795
02:52:55.40 --> 02:53:00.04
don't need to talk to anybody, your socialize, you're just tracking your breath.

2796
02:53:00.04 --> 02:53:02.32
And I can't even do it.

2797
02:53:02.32 --> 02:53:06.60
My mind's going all over the place, but guess what happens during a race, my mind's going

2798
02:53:06.60 --> 02:53:07.60
all over the place.

2799
02:53:07.60 --> 02:53:12.08
So the quicker that I can notice when my mind is wandered and bring it back to the

2800
02:53:12.08 --> 02:53:13.08
breath.

2801
02:53:13.08 --> 02:53:16.88
The simple exercise to just notice when your mind has wandered and bring it back to the

2802
02:53:16.88 --> 02:53:22.32
task in hand, this for a tactical leader, anyone in tactical environment or in athletic

2803
02:53:22.32 --> 02:53:26.52
environment, I think this is gold and stuff.

2804
02:53:26.52 --> 02:53:31.08
And it just takes a little bit of discipline doing it every day and just working on

2805
02:53:31.08 --> 02:53:35.16
a stability to notice your mind, just notice where it's going.

2806
02:53:35.16 --> 02:53:36.52
It's not a problem that it's drift.

2807
02:53:36.52 --> 02:53:37.52
It's going to drift.

2808
02:53:37.52 --> 02:53:41.92
It's just working on noticing that it's drifted a little bit quicker and then bring it

2809
02:53:41.92 --> 02:53:43.96
back.

2810
02:53:43.96 --> 02:53:51.64
So you work the breath, you work the skills, you're at the right altitude, you're training,

2811
02:53:51.64 --> 02:53:56.92
you're going to school, you rolled into the 2018 Paralympic Games.

2812
02:53:56.92 --> 02:53:59.28
You're ready to rock and roll.

2813
02:53:59.28 --> 02:54:02.92
I think so in retrospect, I was very much ready to rock and roll.

2814
02:54:02.92 --> 02:54:05.04
I, I didn't know those games.

2815
02:54:05.04 --> 02:54:07.12
They were in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

2816
02:54:07.12 --> 02:54:11.88
And I would be going as a full-time graduate student, but what that meant was that,

2817
02:54:11.88 --> 02:54:15.44
just lucky for me, it lined up with spring break and I was going to skip a week

2818
02:54:15.44 --> 02:54:16.44
of class.

2819
02:54:16.44 --> 02:54:21.04
So I'd be gone for two weeks, total, but only miss one week of class.

2820
02:54:21.04 --> 02:54:23.76
My spring break was competing in Korea.

2821
02:54:23.76 --> 02:54:26.64
I didn't have any sense of pressure or expectation.

2822
02:54:26.64 --> 02:54:28.36
My competitors aren't in graduate school.

2823
02:54:28.36 --> 02:54:29.36
I don't know.

2824
02:54:29.36 --> 02:54:30.88
No one expects me to do anything.

2825
02:54:30.88 --> 02:54:34.64
I'm not one of the people that the media pre-pics to do well.

2826
02:54:34.64 --> 02:54:36.68
I didn't have good results.

2827
02:54:36.68 --> 02:54:38.32
I qualified, whatever.

2828
02:54:38.32 --> 02:54:40.04
But I've been training, going up to Vermont.

2829
02:54:40.04 --> 02:54:40.80
I was ready to go.

2830
02:54:40.80 --> 02:54:41.64
I showed up.

2831
02:54:41.64 --> 02:54:47.56
The plan was to do six races in that about eight days span, three by a thundery, cross country.

2832
02:54:47.56 --> 02:54:50.52
The first race was the morning after the opening ceremony.

2833
02:54:50.52 --> 02:54:52.52
Didn't go to the opening ceremony.

2834
02:54:52.52 --> 02:54:54.88
I wanted to be arrested.

2835
02:54:54.88 --> 02:55:00.04
The first race is a sprint by a thundery, which is a tough race because you don't have

2836
02:55:00.04 --> 02:55:06.24
time to take that cool breath, extra to hit the, you know, you got to, because it's

2837
02:55:06.24 --> 02:55:07.24
such a short ski race.

2838
02:55:07.24 --> 02:55:09.64
It's a 7.5 kilometer ski race.

2839
02:55:09.64 --> 02:55:12.84
You got to go hard and you got to shoot fast in your shots.

2840
02:55:12.84 --> 02:55:14.92
It was a windy day.

2841
02:55:14.92 --> 02:55:17.96
Not to mention of all the races to put first.

2842
02:55:17.96 --> 02:55:21.16
I think that's the hardest one because you're amped up.

2843
02:55:21.16 --> 02:55:25.72
And by a fun, I had a different optimal mental state than I do in cross country and

2844
02:55:25.72 --> 02:55:26.72
cross country.

2845
02:55:26.72 --> 02:55:30.16
I want to be just, it's like cycle, right?

2846
02:55:30.16 --> 02:55:32.56
Yeah, I am going to, there's no holding back.

2847
02:55:32.56 --> 02:55:34.12
Barry myself on this race.

2848
02:55:34.12 --> 02:55:37.72
And then by a fun, if you have that added in sochi, the first race off the bat was the

2849
02:55:37.72 --> 02:55:38.72
sprint by a fun.

2850
02:55:38.72 --> 02:55:43.76
Like I came in way too hot and missed three shots out of the way too hot.

2851
02:55:43.76 --> 02:55:44.76
But that was a learning point.

2852
02:55:44.76 --> 02:55:49.76
And sochi also learned, do not look at the big screen.

2853
02:55:49.76 --> 02:55:51.88
That has the real time race results.

2854
02:55:51.88 --> 02:55:53.84
I'd ski by didn't look at it, see where I what?

2855
02:55:53.84 --> 02:55:54.84
Don't do that.

2856
02:55:54.84 --> 02:55:56.84
Listen to the announcer comes in one year out the other.

2857
02:55:56.84 --> 02:56:01.84
Like I had learned a lot of lessons that I was going to rigidly try to apply.

2858
02:56:01.84 --> 02:56:04.52
And just take one race at the time.

2859
02:56:04.52 --> 02:56:06.20
Don't think about the next race.

2860
02:56:06.20 --> 02:56:10.92
If a race goes bad, or if even five minutes ago something bad happened in this race,

2861
02:56:10.92 --> 02:56:11.92
it's gone.

2862
02:56:11.92 --> 02:56:16.28
The only thing you can do is affect right now.

2863
02:56:16.28 --> 02:56:18.72
I can't affect five minutes ago.

2864
02:56:18.72 --> 02:56:23.08
If I do things properly now, the future will be the way I want it to be.

2865
02:56:23.08 --> 02:56:26.000
But I can't be, it doesn't know good to think about the future.

2866
02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.24
All I can do is act right here and right now.

2867
02:56:29.24 --> 02:56:30.24
What's right in front of me?

2868
02:56:30.24 --> 02:56:32.000
If it's a hill, I'm going to attack the hill.

2869
02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.24
I'm not going to be thinking about what's going to happen in three minutes when I hit

2870
02:56:35.24 --> 02:56:36.08
the shooting range.

2871
02:56:36.08 --> 02:56:38.24
That was kind of my mindset.

2872
02:56:38.24 --> 02:56:41.96
This was informed by some of the classes I had taken and just I was going to apply this

2873
02:56:41.96 --> 02:56:43.32
and just see how it goes.

2874
02:56:43.32 --> 02:56:47.20
The first race, ski the first lap.

2875
02:56:47.20 --> 02:56:48.20
We had good skis.

2876
02:56:48.20 --> 02:56:49.20
It was a hilly course.

2877
02:56:49.20 --> 02:56:50.20
This is a good advantage for me.

2878
02:56:50.20 --> 02:56:53.16
Windy day went through.

2879
02:56:53.16 --> 02:56:58.52
First shot hit, second hit, third shot hit, fourth shot hit, fifth shot hit.

2880
02:56:58.52 --> 02:56:59.52
Get out, go.

2881
02:56:59.52 --> 02:57:00.52
Buy past the penalty loop.

2882
02:57:00.52 --> 02:57:02.48
All right, good start.

2883
02:57:02.48 --> 02:57:04.20
Skid the second lap.

2884
02:57:04.20 --> 02:57:06.88
It's about seven minutes per lap.

2885
02:57:06.88 --> 02:57:08.12
Coming to the range.

2886
02:57:08.12 --> 02:57:10.24
All right, I'm a shooter now.

2887
02:57:10.24 --> 02:57:11.24
Let's go.

2888
02:57:11.24 --> 02:57:14.12
Glasses up, get to the mat, lay down.

2889
02:57:14.12 --> 02:57:15.64
Take the rifle.

2890
02:57:15.64 --> 02:57:16.64
Check out the wind.

2891
02:57:16.64 --> 02:57:19.56
It was windy, kind of gusting and swirling.

2892
02:57:19.56 --> 02:57:24.16
For shot hit, second shot hit, third shot hit, fourth shot hit.

2893
02:57:24.16 --> 02:57:26.64
Then I started, like, oh my god, I got hit the shot.

2894
02:57:26.64 --> 02:57:32.72
My rhythm was off and I'm going to take a couple of breaths.

2895
02:57:32.72 --> 02:57:38.48
I lined up the sights and squeezed off the round and I jerked the trigger and it was a miss.

2896
02:57:38.48 --> 02:57:41.24
I got up just mat.

2897
02:57:41.24 --> 02:57:44.36
So I skid into the penalty loop, skid it and then I exit the penalty loop and pretty

2898
02:57:44.36 --> 02:57:47.68
quickly there's a coach there yelling like, hey everybody's miss.

2899
02:57:47.68 --> 02:57:49.32
Like all the key players have missed.

2900
02:57:49.32 --> 02:57:51.48
It's okay, clean slate, let's go.

2901
02:57:51.48 --> 02:57:57.16
Either way, you go either way, but it's nice to know everybody's like the top guys

2902
02:57:57.16 --> 02:57:58.16
have missed.

2903
02:57:58.16 --> 02:58:02.64
So I went as hard as I could on that last lap and I remember coming into the finish line.

2904
02:58:02.64 --> 02:58:05.24
You don't because it's individual starts, it's not head to head.

2905
02:58:05.24 --> 02:58:06.72
It's like a time trial.

2906
02:58:06.72 --> 02:58:08.68
You don't know, you have a general idea.

2907
02:58:08.68 --> 02:58:14.32
I knew that probably, I mean, contention, but you don't know to the second where you are.

2908
02:58:14.32 --> 02:58:18.64
You just have to find ways to push yourself knowing that every second counts and that last

2909
02:58:18.64 --> 02:58:23.16
stretch going as hard as I could across the line and I had told myself, I'm not looking

2910
02:58:23.16 --> 02:58:25.84
up at that screen to see the race results.

2911
02:58:25.84 --> 02:58:26.84
I'm not doing it.

2912
02:58:26.84 --> 02:58:28.96
I'm not doing it during the race and I'm not doing it after.

2913
02:58:28.96 --> 02:58:32.72
So I crossed the line and know how I finished and I just go out and I like eating or recovery

2914
02:58:32.72 --> 02:58:38.000
bar and someone is taking a few minutes later, taking off the timing ship and they said,

2915
02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
I'm American one.

2916
02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:41.92
I don't know who was it.

2917
02:58:41.92 --> 02:58:46.72
I don't know, it's got a kind of a weird last name and my two other teammates in the

2918
02:58:46.72 --> 02:58:49.72
race had pretty easy to pronounce names.

2919
02:58:49.72 --> 02:58:52.56
Maybe that was me.

2920
02:58:52.56 --> 02:58:57.72
It was seven seconds separation between first and second, a bellot rooosh and athlete

2921
02:58:57.72 --> 02:59:00.92
got second place and that was unexpected.

2922
02:59:00.92 --> 02:59:01.92
Gold medal.

2923
02:59:01.92 --> 02:59:04.04
Gold medal out of the gate.

2924
02:59:04.04 --> 02:59:05.04
Out of the gate.

2925
02:59:05.04 --> 02:59:08.40
Good way to start the games.

2926
02:59:08.40 --> 02:59:10.56
Then you kept rocking through the through the games.

2927
02:59:10.56 --> 02:59:11.68
Yeah, it was tough races.

2928
02:59:11.68 --> 02:59:17.28
The next day's race, I was going to one race at a time and the next race was a very difficult

2929
02:59:17.28 --> 02:59:20.04
the 15 kilometer cross country race.

2930
02:59:20.04 --> 02:59:25.96
Actually, on the first lap, had a great first lap and was right where you would want

2931
02:59:25.96 --> 02:59:28.12
to be on the second lap.

2932
02:59:28.12 --> 02:59:29.12
I didn't take it into account.

2933
02:59:29.12 --> 02:59:30.12
It was warm.

2934
02:59:30.12 --> 02:59:32.24
The sun was kind of degrading the tracks.

2935
02:59:32.24 --> 02:59:37.80
I had done the first lap on this critical fast sweeping downhill left turn in the

2936
02:59:37.80 --> 02:59:39.72
track, which kind of guides you around.

2937
02:59:39.72 --> 02:59:43.36
You can be in the track or out of the track, but I had been in the track in a tuck.

2938
02:59:43.36 --> 02:59:44.36
Low aerodynamic.

2939
02:59:44.36 --> 02:59:47.24
The second lap, low aerodynamic.

2940
02:59:47.24 --> 02:59:48.24
Same thing.

2941
02:59:48.24 --> 02:59:49.24
I didn't take it into account.

2942
02:59:49.24 --> 02:59:50.24
The tracks had degraded.

2943
02:59:50.24 --> 02:59:51.24
Other skiers had gone through.

2944
02:59:51.24 --> 02:59:52.24
They had created some exit channels.

2945
02:59:52.24 --> 02:59:53.72
So I was in that tuck.

2946
02:59:53.72 --> 02:59:58.12
I just, like, all, split out, totally wiped out.

2947
02:59:58.12 --> 03:00:00.52
I got up and I had blood on my arm.

2948
03:00:00.52 --> 03:00:01.52
I was racing to a t-shirt.

2949
03:00:01.52 --> 03:00:02.52
It was so warm.

2950
03:00:02.52 --> 03:00:04.36
This is the winner games.

2951
03:00:04.36 --> 03:00:05.96
But none of my equipment was broken.

2952
03:00:05.96 --> 03:00:07.36
I started skiing.

2953
03:00:07.36 --> 03:00:11.04
I really was just thinking.

2954
03:00:11.04 --> 03:00:13.000
It's not about quitting or any of that.

2955
03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.80
I proven, it's about being a smart athlete.

2956
03:00:15.80 --> 03:00:17.20
I got four races to go.

2957
03:00:17.20 --> 03:00:18.20
This one is two laps.

2958
03:00:18.20 --> 03:00:19.48
It's a five lap race.

2959
03:00:19.48 --> 03:00:21.20
15 kilometers.

2960
03:00:21.20 --> 03:00:23.40
35 or so more minutes.

2961
03:00:23.40 --> 03:00:27.56
This really makes sense to go hard and get eight plays, ninth plays.

2962
03:00:27.56 --> 03:00:29.72
I can try to work my way back into this.

2963
03:00:29.72 --> 03:00:32.56
But, you know, this race is going to make me tired.

2964
03:00:32.56 --> 03:00:34.84
I got four more to go.

2965
03:00:34.84 --> 03:00:38.000
Maybe it's actually better to sit it out.

2966
03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.80
To exit the course and just be done.

2967
03:00:40.80 --> 03:00:44.24
It's a do not finish, did not finish course.

2968
03:00:44.24 --> 03:00:47.08
But I just kind of skint like three quarters effort.

2969
03:00:47.08 --> 03:00:50.08
I had lost all this momentum that would have carried me up and over the next hill.

2970
03:00:50.08 --> 03:00:53.36
I'm like, you know, digging that, digging myself out of that hole.

2971
03:00:53.36 --> 03:00:54.88
I just don't know if it makes sense.

2972
03:00:54.88 --> 03:00:57.20
A coach was yelling, you're still on it.

2973
03:00:57.20 --> 03:00:58.20
Go, go, go.

2974
03:00:58.20 --> 03:01:03.88
I just kind of responded to the coach like an athlete and started going.

2975
03:01:03.88 --> 03:01:05.92
And I'm like, well, let's just see what, you know, it's the games.

2976
03:01:05.92 --> 03:01:06.92
I've trained years for this.

2977
03:01:06.92 --> 03:01:07.92
Let's just go.

2978
03:01:07.92 --> 03:01:08.92
See what happens.

2979
03:01:08.92 --> 03:01:12.64
I got 35 minutes to work my way back into it.

2980
03:01:12.64 --> 03:01:13.64
I got time.

2981
03:01:13.64 --> 03:01:15.12
It's looking at it a different way.

2982
03:01:15.12 --> 03:01:18.44
Instead of like, does it make sense to go hard for 35 minutes?

2983
03:01:18.44 --> 03:01:19.92
Well, I got 35 minutes.

2984
03:01:19.92 --> 03:01:20.92
Let's go.

2985
03:01:20.92 --> 03:01:23.68
So I kind of, I was seeing my progress improve.

2986
03:01:23.68 --> 03:01:24.68
You get lap splits.

2987
03:01:24.68 --> 03:01:26.92
But again, you're just pushing yourself.

2988
03:01:26.92 --> 03:01:29.44
My lap splits after every lap were getting a little bit better.

2989
03:01:29.44 --> 03:01:34.56
And then on the last lap, it was kind of like five of us are kind of in it.

2990
03:01:34.56 --> 03:01:36.52
They don't exactly know where you gotta go.

2991
03:01:36.52 --> 03:01:41.80
And so I just, I went really hard and I crossed the line and I ended up getting second.

2992
03:01:41.80 --> 03:01:48.64
But for me, I'm actually more proud of this race than the gold medal race because I think

2993
03:01:48.64 --> 03:01:51.40
that in sports, it's all about character development.

2994
03:01:51.40 --> 03:01:54.84
The sport in the race itself, the in the medal, none of that really matters.

2995
03:01:54.84 --> 03:01:59.40
What matters is what the person that it's making you and you actually learn more from

2996
03:01:59.40 --> 03:02:01.56
setbacks and okay, I got second place.

2997
03:02:01.56 --> 03:02:09.76
Whatever place I got that day, it was about taking a fall despite all my training in the

2998
03:02:09.76 --> 03:02:10.76
lead up.

2999
03:02:10.76 --> 03:02:15.64
Sometimes you make mistakes or sometimes it's just things happen, right?

3000
03:02:15.64 --> 03:02:24.36
It's about getting up and I had doubt, kind of was working its way into my mind.

3001
03:02:24.36 --> 03:02:26.32
That's probably natural.

3002
03:02:26.32 --> 03:02:31.56
But working through that doubt by doing what I trained to do, which is to push hard and

3003
03:02:31.56 --> 03:02:33.16
go hard to the finish line.

3004
03:02:33.16 --> 03:02:39.36
And so for me, this race is more meaningful in a internal way.

3005
03:02:39.36 --> 03:02:42.92
Of course, the previous days race, I got to see the flag go up.

3006
03:02:42.92 --> 03:02:47.64
That was very special too, but the cross country race the next day was more meaningful

3007
03:02:47.64 --> 03:02:49.52
in that sense.

3008
03:02:49.52 --> 03:02:54.84
And you end up with one gold, four silver and one bronze.

3009
03:02:54.84 --> 03:03:05.32
Yes, I had, I was just in that really sweet spot of physical peak, mental peak, all lining

3010
03:03:05.32 --> 03:03:10.04
up in a four year cycle, really like a seven year cycle, because I'm doing this, trying

3011
03:03:10.04 --> 03:03:14.12
to train since 2011, 2012, moving out to Colorado.

3012
03:03:14.12 --> 03:03:23.000
So timing that, and I was 37 years old, I felt like it's the blend of time in the sport,

3013
03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:31.88
seven plus years plus not being over 40 like I am now, which helps with recovery, everything

3014
03:03:31.88 --> 03:03:34.04
that it was just everything was lining up.

3015
03:03:34.04 --> 03:03:38.56
And the course, note out, played into my strengths with Hill climbing.

3016
03:03:38.56 --> 03:03:42.80
And you end up getting the best male athlete of the games.

3017
03:03:42.80 --> 03:03:44.12
Is that all right?

3018
03:03:44.12 --> 03:03:45.12
That's right.

3019
03:03:45.12 --> 03:03:49.80
I think that's kind of like stud, so there you go, right?

3020
03:03:49.80 --> 03:03:54.68
Well, I think you're supposed to say this, well, it's not about metals or awards, of course

3021
03:03:54.68 --> 03:03:56.48
I'm proud of it.

3022
03:03:56.48 --> 03:03:59.52
And that I performed like that.

3023
03:03:59.52 --> 03:04:09.08
But I think it was a fair and clean field, and that I got to represent the United States

3024
03:04:09.08 --> 03:04:11.20
overseas.

3025
03:04:11.20 --> 03:04:20.24
And for me, this was just a time that I could, you know, all of this work, most of it was

3026
03:04:20.24 --> 03:04:21.24
unseen.

3027
03:04:21.24 --> 03:04:25.64
Yeah, you get on a podium ceremony or get voted the best male athlete.

3028
03:04:25.64 --> 03:04:31.52
Nobody saw the hard work I was doing in Colorado back in the day on those dirt roads.

3029
03:04:31.52 --> 03:04:34.32
And I'm by myself in the summer.

3030
03:04:34.32 --> 03:04:37.16
And that's actually what I'm most proud of.

3031
03:04:37.16 --> 03:04:44.12
And what is most meaningful for me was that it wasn't the end result of winning or getting

3032
03:04:44.12 --> 03:04:46.16
second or whatever the race was all well.

3033
03:04:46.16 --> 03:04:55.56
It was putting in the work and pushing myself and growing and

3034
03:04:55.56 --> 03:05:01.24
reconnecting with nature and all of it, but really it was about the work in the training.

3035
03:05:01.24 --> 03:05:03.92
So where are we at now?

3036
03:05:03.92 --> 03:05:05.92
So that was 2018.

3037
03:05:05.92 --> 03:05:10.80
Yeah, 2018, I did unexpectedly well.

3038
03:05:10.80 --> 03:05:18.32
And then that opened up some opportunities that I didn't see coming or expect, but you

3039
03:05:18.32 --> 03:05:20.44
know I had after my injury I stayed.

3040
03:05:20.44 --> 03:05:22.76
I didn't talk about, I didn't talk about it.

3041
03:05:22.76 --> 03:05:30.04
I have read about general Ulysses S. Grant serving in the Civil War and refusing to

3042
03:05:30.04 --> 03:05:36.56
cash in on his service, not to write a memoir at the very end of his life he did because

3043
03:05:36.56 --> 03:05:39.48
his wife was dying and he was broke.

3044
03:05:39.48 --> 03:05:40.48
broke.

3045
03:05:40.48 --> 03:05:44.04
He had been swindled and so he decided to write a memoir.

3046
03:05:44.04 --> 03:05:47.80
I just, I didn't feel comfortable talking about injury.

3047
03:05:47.80 --> 03:05:51.96
I didn't even have anybody asking me to talk about my injury.

3048
03:05:51.96 --> 03:05:54.000
So it was pretty easy not to have to talk about it.

3049
03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:57.52
So when I was out there just training, I was just doing the work, doing the work, doing

3050
03:05:57.52 --> 03:06:02.80
the work and now all of a sudden it's like, oh, I have these opportunities to like monetize

3051
03:06:02.80 --> 03:06:07.48
or what, you know, just I can actually create opportunities to give talks in this kind

3052
03:06:07.48 --> 03:06:11.68
of thing and that came my way.

3053
03:06:11.68 --> 03:06:13.24
And I had to do some soul searching.

3054
03:06:13.24 --> 03:06:15.24
Is this right for me?

3055
03:06:15.24 --> 03:06:24.24
For me, in where I'm at and what I want to do and I thought if I try it, it's a challenge

3056
03:06:24.24 --> 03:06:25.92
because there's a couple things going on.

3057
03:06:25.92 --> 03:06:31.24
If I'm going to be honest with myself, one, I'm not comfortable publicly speaking.

3058
03:06:31.24 --> 03:06:33.36
Let's just be honest about it.

3059
03:06:33.36 --> 03:06:34.36
I'm not comfortable.

3060
03:06:34.36 --> 03:06:37.12
It's like getting in the water or trying to jump out of an airplane.

3061
03:06:37.12 --> 03:06:39.28
It's in that realm.

3062
03:06:39.28 --> 03:06:45.04
That really, and then the other thing is I just don't know, I mean, in the teens, we're

3063
03:06:45.04 --> 03:06:48.40
getting told, you know, you'd be quite professional, just put it in the hard work.

3064
03:06:48.40 --> 03:06:50.52
Don't seek glory, this kind of thing.

3065
03:06:50.52 --> 03:06:52.08
So that was all going on.

3066
03:06:52.08 --> 03:06:58.28
But okay, I'll try, I'll just at least try to develop a narrative and see how it goes.

3067
03:06:58.28 --> 03:07:03.88
And I worked on that a lot and then I started giving some talks and that came about because

3068
03:07:03.88 --> 03:07:08.76
I got some medals and it had those results.

3069
03:07:08.76 --> 03:07:12.40
Those opportunities didn't exist even though I'm the same person with essentially the

3070
03:07:12.40 --> 03:07:15.60
same background in 2014.

3071
03:07:15.60 --> 03:07:16.84
Yeah, check.

3072
03:07:16.84 --> 03:07:18.88
That's just how things work in this world.

3073
03:07:18.88 --> 03:07:25.80
Yeah, and I mean, from my perspective, obviously, I look at it as not so much you taking

3074
03:07:25.80 --> 03:07:28.72
the opportunity to monetize what you've been through.

3075
03:07:28.72 --> 03:07:32.04
But to me, it's more important to go out there and share what you've been through because

3076
03:07:32.04 --> 03:07:35.20
they can legitimately help out a lot of people.

3077
03:07:35.20 --> 03:07:42.32
And, you know, I had one of our admirals one time tell me, you know, we were having

3078
03:07:42.32 --> 03:07:48.64
a talk, I had a book coming out and, you know, he said something along the lines of, you

3079
03:07:48.64 --> 03:07:52.04
know, I was like, well, you know, this is not really the quiet professional for me to be

3080
03:07:52.04 --> 03:07:53.04
doing this.

3081
03:07:53.04 --> 03:07:56.000
And he said something along the lines of, hey, we need to be quiet professionals, but

3082
03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:59.16
that doesn't mean silent professionals and there's stories that should be told.

3083
03:07:59.16 --> 03:08:03.96
And as far as I, my opinion is you have a story that should absolutely be told.

3084
03:08:03.96 --> 03:08:09.08
And I mean, when you're talking, and we probably could do a nine hour podcast if we

3085
03:08:09.08 --> 03:08:12.80
went back and got medical records, when you're talking about all the things that you

3086
03:08:12.80 --> 03:08:19.24
were going through from the time you woke up in the hospital, like I'm a baby.

3087
03:08:19.24 --> 03:08:25.20
Like I, I'm hearing the things that I'm, I'm like mad if, you know, you know, like the

3088
03:08:25.20 --> 03:08:28.64
floors cold when I get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I'm like,

3089
03:08:28.64 --> 03:08:29.64
oh, this is weird.

3090
03:08:29.64 --> 03:08:30.64
You know what I mean?

3091
03:08:30.64 --> 03:08:35.48
Like, or like, I'll get like a springed ankle and I'll have to wear an ankle brace.

3092
03:08:35.48 --> 03:08:38.88
And I'll be like, take off the scarf. So I'm so mad about it. You know, I'm sitting here

3093
03:08:38.88 --> 03:08:44.28
just thinking, man, the perspective that you have. And then you took it even one step

3094
03:08:44.28 --> 03:08:50.24
further, like you're sitting there with a guy that's a triple amputee. And he's over

3095
03:08:50.24 --> 03:08:55.92
there getting after it, trying to make his life better. So man, I think to the contrary

3096
03:08:55.92 --> 03:08:59.96
of what you're kind of saying about like, oh, trying to monetize this and the professional

3097
03:08:59.96 --> 03:09:04.96
is like, hey, man, this is things are going to help people. A lot of people that are in a tough

3098
03:09:04.96 --> 03:09:11.88
spot. And also, you know, team guys that are going to go through tough situations and

3099
03:09:11.88 --> 03:09:18.20
and just other veterans, just the human beings, man, life is hard. And for someone like

3100
03:09:18.20 --> 03:09:23.24
you that's been through the hardest of situation and still be able to get up and

3101
03:09:23.24 --> 03:09:30.36
every day keep getting after it, man, that's like that's you. I would actually tell you if you're

3102
03:09:30.36 --> 03:09:35.16
not sharing this story. I think that's actually kind of wrong, bro, to be honest with you.

3103
03:09:35.16 --> 03:09:41.24
Yeah. And that is the side of the fence I'm on right now is that it actually could be selfish

3104
03:09:41.24 --> 03:09:50.84
of me to not tell my story to, to for some valorized concept of, you know, whatever, not

3105
03:09:50.84 --> 03:09:57.64
cashier and or, but really this, the opportunity presented itself because of some success that

3106
03:09:57.64 --> 03:10:03.56
I didn't have four years prior. But now there's some opportunities to talk my friend from the

3107
03:10:03.56 --> 03:10:10.36
teams started this company, O2X that is doing awesome work. And there, I don't have any

3108
03:10:11.16 --> 03:10:17.24
hold-ups of going and giving classes to firefighters and other public service professionals

3109
03:10:17.24 --> 03:10:22.84
as part of the O2X team teaching principles of resilience or mental toughness, grit, whatever

3110
03:10:22.84 --> 03:10:27.80
you want to call it. But also working on goal setting because in my own life setting goals is

3111
03:10:27.80 --> 03:10:33.32
an athlete setting goals after my injury, setting goals at the Naval Academy, that'll really

3112
03:10:33.32 --> 03:10:37.88
helped me. And it doesn't mean you have to have goals, but if you have a powerful long-term goal,

3113
03:10:37.88 --> 03:10:44.44
that can be a very very potent force to help you get through difficult situations. But sometimes

3114
03:10:44.44 --> 03:10:50.52
those long-term goals can be discouraging in the moment of intensity. And so you're teaching,

3115
03:10:50.52 --> 03:10:57.48
you know, setting middle-term as an athlete year to year, I set performance goals based on various

3116
03:10:57.48 --> 03:11:03.40
different categories of performance that do not entirely include physical training. It's a lot of

3117
03:11:03.40 --> 03:11:11.72
nutrition sleep, mental skills in this kind of thing, tactical technical. And so also teaching them

3118
03:11:11.72 --> 03:11:18.76
that in the moment of a tactical situation when chaos is just everywhere, that you can set micro goals,

3119
03:11:18.76 --> 03:11:24.28
just to be aware of that, that this idea of you're never out of the fight, you just always

3120
03:11:24.28 --> 03:11:30.52
something you can do one more step forward, something that can contribute positively, that this is

3121
03:11:30.52 --> 03:11:36.20
very powerful. And also what you taught me, I teach them as well, prioritize and execute. What's the

3122
03:11:36.20 --> 03:11:40.44
most important thing that you need to be focusing on right now, either act on it yourself or

3123
03:11:40.44 --> 03:11:46.36
delegate it. And then what's the next most important thing? With improvement in experience and training,

3124
03:11:46.36 --> 03:11:51.32
you can more quickly identify what is the most important thing to work on. But I just passing on

3125
03:11:51.32 --> 03:11:58.60
those lessons learned to tactical athletes as part of O2-Exley. That's just a no-brainer. I love

3126
03:11:58.60 --> 03:12:03.96
being part of the team to do that. Yeah, that's awesome. So are you training for 2022 now?

3127
03:12:03.96 --> 03:12:12.12
Well, I competed recently in the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. And I came back with one gold medal

3128
03:12:12.12 --> 03:12:19.32
as part of a team relay. And it again was a six race individual format with the very last day

3129
03:12:19.32 --> 03:12:27.08
being a team event. And the first race off the bat was that same by Athlon. And so now I'm going in

3130
03:12:27.08 --> 03:12:33.24
with, okay, I've had four years since 2018, I knew that going in there would be a, they would be a

3131
03:12:33.24 --> 03:12:38.44
little bit more attention directed to whatever extent that would be. It would be more than

3132
03:12:39.40 --> 03:12:43.80
per four, 2018, which was nothing. So that there's going to be maybe some more people want to

3133
03:12:43.80 --> 03:12:49.32
do an interview or some media outlets or some maybe sponsorship opportunities, this kind of thing.

3134
03:12:49.32 --> 03:12:56.84
And with that, I started to feel, okay, somebody sponsors you, they want you to get a medal.

3135
03:12:58.20 --> 03:13:02.76
They want you to perform, this is a different situation. So going into 2014 brand new didn't know

3136
03:13:02.76 --> 03:13:10.20
anything. Going into 2018, more experienced, but with no expectations, either externally or internally.

3137
03:13:10.20 --> 03:13:16.04
Now, external expectations probably, even though no one's going to say that, but really some

3138
03:13:16.04 --> 03:13:21.08
internal expectations, because I'm perceiving those external expectations, that was a different,

3139
03:13:21.08 --> 03:13:25.64
a different, just, every, each one of the games I've been to is different in that sense. But of course,

3140
03:13:25.64 --> 03:13:30.92
training just focus on what you can do, execute the training plan, working through getting,

3141
03:13:30.92 --> 03:13:34.20
you know, positive communication with the coaches, working adjusting the training plan,

3142
03:13:35.32 --> 03:13:41.48
COVID happened that didn't interrupt my personal training so much, but interrupted the competitive

3143
03:13:41.48 --> 03:13:49.80
scene somewhat. And then this season, just doing a lot of altitude exposure training actually in

3144
03:13:49.80 --> 03:13:56.84
Boseman, Montana with the team focusing on biathlon support at the range we have there. And showed

3145
03:13:56.84 --> 03:14:04.84
up that first biathlon was, again, as usual, I'm just really amped up on that one, because the first race

3146
03:14:04.84 --> 03:14:10.36
and just you've been training and the course in China was not as advantageous for my strengths as an

3147
03:14:10.36 --> 03:14:16.36
athlete as it was in 2018, but it was going to be a crime, really slow snow, totally dehydrated snow.

3148
03:14:16.36 --> 03:14:20.52
We were to walk. We were to walk. We were to snow, like, out of the dirt on the sides and stuff.

3149
03:14:20.52 --> 03:14:25.40
Really windy place, just in like blowing, so they groom the course overnight or whenever they did it,

3150
03:14:25.40 --> 03:14:29.88
and then you show up in the morning, but the wind was picking up, outlying snow and blowing

3151
03:14:29.88 --> 03:14:34.12
out of the dirt. And so that was just the slowest stuff ever. So this is going to be some

3152
03:14:34.12 --> 03:14:39.56
challenges. It's going to be grind. In that first race, we were competing against Chinese athletes.

3153
03:14:39.56 --> 03:14:45.16
I hadn't seen that scene. I'm in the competitive circuit. And keeping in mind, I'm a sit skier.

3154
03:14:45.72 --> 03:14:51.72
There is, I would say, a lot less technique in cross country, sit skiing than there is in cross

3155
03:14:51.72 --> 03:14:57.64
country. Standing scenes were only maneuvering our poles. So there is, I think, an ability to rapidly

3156
03:14:57.64 --> 03:15:04.44
develop athletes in my sport sitting as compared to in the standing discipline. But that first race,

3157
03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:09.48
I'm very proud of it. I came in hit five shots, came in again for the second and final shooting stage,

3158
03:15:09.48 --> 03:15:15.40
hit five shots. It was windy, ski hard, absolutely. When it's hard as I could on the last lap,

3159
03:15:15.40 --> 03:15:22.92
because I was just off of third place. The last split I got was on the last lap, just having hit

3160
03:15:22.92 --> 03:15:32.92
all 10 shots, your five seconds off third place. That is a motivating, I just was about,

3161
03:15:33.48 --> 03:15:39.56
in where it altitude. I crossed the line and I don't done a lot of racing at 5,500 feet. Like,

3162
03:15:39.56 --> 03:15:45.24
we were trained at it. But at a game's race at that altitude, when you're going absolutely as hard

3163
03:15:45.24 --> 03:15:51.96
as you can, it's painful. And I finished that race in fourth place, but I can tell you that that was

3164
03:15:51.96 --> 03:15:57.24
perhaps in my own estimation, the best race I've ever had. It doesn't matter what place it was.

3165
03:15:58.36 --> 03:16:02.52
Of course, getting on the podium is nice, but it's about the execution of your own race.

3166
03:16:02.52 --> 03:16:08.04
You do not control who else is out there. The second race, the next day was 18 kilometers.

3167
03:16:08.84 --> 03:16:13.56
One of the better races I felt like I've ever executed in terms of pacing, six place.

3168
03:16:13.56 --> 03:16:19.88
Then, race is number three and four. Then it goes so well. I sat one out. It was a name to the

3169
03:16:19.88 --> 03:16:26.04
relay team. A relay team consisted of four legs. I was the third leg. At this point, my mentality

3170
03:16:26.04 --> 03:16:30.52
is just take what I was given and try to gain a couple seconds or something. Pass it off to the

3171
03:16:30.52 --> 03:16:38.92
anchor leg. We unexpectedly got first place. We beat some more favorite teams. I ended up getting to

3172
03:16:38.92 --> 03:16:46.60
come home with the gold medal. I can tell you that that was a more special experience than an individual

3173
03:16:46.60 --> 03:16:54.68
medal. Part of a team. To be part of a team. I felt it. I felt it during the race.

3174
03:16:54.68 --> 03:17:00.92
The difference of an individual race versus a race where someone passed it off to you and you're

3175
03:17:00.92 --> 03:17:05.08
going to pass it off to someone else and you don't want to let them down. They're counting on you.

3176
03:17:05.08 --> 03:17:10.60
That's a different individual sport to have that team element is just awesome.

3177
03:17:12.44 --> 03:17:20.52
Right on. I guess that brings us up to where we're at today. Is there anything else echo?

3178
03:17:20.52 --> 03:17:24.92
Are you going to question? Probably a good place to wrap it up. Echo, are you going to questions?

3179
03:17:24.92 --> 03:17:28.60
Yeah, we were talking before we started recording about your journey. You were asking pretty

3180
03:17:28.60 --> 03:17:36.04
kind of hardcore about the tournament scenario. How it's laid out. Is that to indicate that you are considering

3181
03:17:36.04 --> 03:17:45.000
doing you Jitsu? I was asking Jocco. Is this possible? Is it adaptive martial arts?

3182
03:17:45.72 --> 03:17:53.32
Well, actually let me rephrase that. There is no, you would compete with other dudes and there is no.

3183
03:17:53.32 --> 03:17:59.000
I've never seen, I've never seen like, oh, here's a bunch of guys without legs that are going to

3184
03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:03.96
do Jitsu. It's no, you'll compete against other dudes because Jitsu itself is adaptive.

3185
03:18:05.96 --> 03:18:13.32
You would figure out moves that work for you that you'd figure out how to do it. There's

3186
03:18:13.32 --> 03:18:19.24
competitive wrestlers that have fought in the NCAAs that have one leg, no leg, no legs,

3187
03:18:19.24 --> 03:18:27.16
and they just adapt their body to figure out how to win. And so, yeah, there's the sport itself

3188
03:18:27.16 --> 03:18:34.04
is adaptive, but there would be no other special rules. I mean, you go to Jitsu competition,

3189
03:18:34.04 --> 03:18:38.44
there'll be people that are blind. They do have one rule like in wrestling. If it's a blind

3190
03:18:38.44 --> 03:18:41.48
wrestler, they have to, you have to maintain contact with them. But that's the only rule.

3191
03:18:41.48 --> 03:18:44.52
That's wrestling too. Yeah, I don't even know if that's Jitsu or not.

3192
03:18:44.52 --> 03:18:50.36
Yeah, but there's, we have friends that, I mean, I have friends that's paralyzed, you know,

3193
03:18:50.92 --> 03:18:55.64
pretty much chest down. He does Jitsu too. That's awesome. And there's definitely, like I said,

3194
03:18:55.64 --> 03:19:00.84
there's people with one leg. One of the greatest Jitsu players of all time, Jean Jacques Machado.

3195
03:19:00.84 --> 03:19:07.24
He only has a few fingers on one of his hands and Jitsu grips are really important. We got another

3196
03:19:07.24 --> 03:19:12.12
friend named Jeff Rial. Jeff Rial has one hand and he competes all the time and he just competes.

3197
03:19:12.12 --> 03:19:18.12
He's no special category other than get some. Yeah, I'm here for a few days, so maybe I could

3198
03:19:18.12 --> 03:19:23.40
come and take a class. One of the things I learned and I guess the ultimate thing I've learned

3199
03:19:23.40 --> 03:19:30.52
as an athlete in Paralympic Sport for 10 years and the thing I was telling myself most recently

3200
03:19:30.52 --> 03:19:40.52
in Beijing was it's not about results. It's not about how you feel today. It isn't no one cares

3201
03:19:40.52 --> 03:19:46.60
where you came from. No one cares how old you are. No one cares what you look like. No one cares

3202
03:19:47.16 --> 03:19:52.28
how much money you got. How many degrees you have. None of that matters. The only thing that matters

3203
03:19:52.28 --> 03:19:57.88
is what you can do right here and right now. That's all that matters. And ultimately,

3204
03:19:57.88 --> 03:20:05.32
your opponent is yourself. The voice inside you that's saying, I don't know if I can do this,

3205
03:20:05.32 --> 03:20:10.84
the voice inside you that's saying don't go that hard. It's painful. That voice, that's actually

3206
03:20:10.84 --> 03:20:16.36
what you're competing against. And I think in martial arts, it's probably perhaps even more

3207
03:20:16.36 --> 03:20:21.40
true than in cross country skiing. Yeah, when he had Rob Jones, we did some math work with him.

3208
03:20:21.40 --> 03:20:26.52
Yeah. See if you're given that little Jitsu bug. Remember Kyle Maynard? You know that? Yeah.

3209
03:20:26.52 --> 03:20:31.96
No arms, no legs. Yeah. Right off. Yep. And he would train. And he had trained within before.

3210
03:20:31.96 --> 03:20:37.64
He, that was long time. He might be even be a black boat right now. Thanks, cool. Yeah.

3211
03:20:38.28 --> 03:20:45.56
So yeah, man. Jitsu, for everybody. Everybody. You, you know, we're going over three hours right now.

3212
03:20:45.56 --> 03:20:48.28
Anything to do, anything else that we didn't cover, anything else you want to hit on?

3213
03:20:48.28 --> 03:20:52.52
Thank you. Any final closing thoughts? Covered my life thoroughly. I've been there.

3214
03:20:52.52 --> 03:20:57.64
I've been there. Unpacked my life and brought up a lot of memory. So I appreciate you providing this

3215
03:20:57.64 --> 03:21:02.52
platform and for asking me to part of your podcast is an honor. Yeah. I don't know why it's taken

3216
03:21:02.52 --> 03:21:09.16
so long. Hey, if people want to find you, it's DanConosson.com, right? Yes, I do have a website.

3217
03:21:09.16 --> 03:21:14.20
That's that's where people can find you if they want to. You can go speak. You can go and help

3218
03:21:14.20 --> 03:21:19.48
them out. They can find you on there. Yeah. You don't have any social media do you? No, I got on LinkedIn.

3219
03:21:20.76 --> 03:21:27.08
But that's not social media. I'm not social media. I'm not a social. That's one line that I'm not

3220
03:21:27.08 --> 03:21:31.56
ready to cross right now. Yeah. Well, right on. You got the website there and if you want to

3221
03:21:31.56 --> 03:21:37.08
contact you, they can find you through there. Which is awesome. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Man, thanks for coming

3222
03:21:37.08 --> 03:21:44.36
on. Thanks for sharing your lesson. Learned for sure. And, you know, more important. Thanks for

3223
03:21:44.36 --> 03:21:48.20
what you did for the country. Thanks for what you did for the teams. Thanks for what you've done

3224
03:21:48.20 --> 03:21:56.28
since representing America. That's awesome. And really, it's just, it's always an incredible example

3225
03:21:56.28 --> 03:22:02.12
for me just knowing that you're out there and no matter what's happened, no matter what you've done,

3226
03:22:02.12 --> 03:22:07.000
no matter what you've been through. I know for a fact you're still getting up and you're getting

3227
03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:11.08
after it. And I appreciate being able to follow that example, man. Thank you. Thanks, Chaka.

3228
03:22:11.08 --> 03:22:21.000
And with that Dan, can awesome. Has left the building. Echo Charles. Yes. What was your

3229
03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:28.84
assessment? Okay. So, the first thing what I didn't even realize until a few minutes in is

3230
03:22:28.84 --> 03:22:34.44
when Jason Gardner makes his speech one of his many about training works. And he tells the story.

3231
03:22:34.44 --> 03:22:38.28
You've talked about this guy. Yeah. 100%. That was him. That's crazy. Yeah. Because to me,

3232
03:22:38.28 --> 03:22:41.96
that's one of the better speeches, especially from Jason Gardner like that. That's a, that's

3233
03:22:41.96 --> 03:22:45.56
a, that's what I look forward to. You know, because the way he says it and you're talking about

3234
03:22:45.56 --> 03:22:50.12
the last number of, that's the master. Jason talks about the effectiveness of training and

3235
03:22:50.12 --> 03:22:54.60
just for sure enough. And I didn't want to go through all the details and miss speak anything, but

3236
03:22:54.60 --> 03:23:01.16
some of those details that I did cover for sure. But I'll tell you what, man. And I kind of talked

3237
03:23:01.16 --> 03:23:08.68
about it. But like the amount, like waking up after being in a coma for 10 days and then having just

3238
03:23:09.80 --> 03:23:18.36
the insane medical issues, just insane medical issues, no legs, freaking abdomen blown apart,

3239
03:23:18.36 --> 03:23:24.84
close to me bag, the thing going down your throat, not even allowed to drink one sip of water.

3240
03:23:26.04 --> 03:23:29.72
You know, like I get complain. I have a sore, like here's here's my complaint.

3241
03:23:29.72 --> 03:23:34.12
Like, you know, you know, you're doing your Jitsu and you, and you cut your mouth.

3242
03:23:34.92 --> 03:23:39.24
Sure. Like you cut your tongue. You get ripped. Yeah. You get cut some teeth. And then you can't

3243
03:23:39.24 --> 03:23:44.20
like eat an acidic food for like a week. It's too. Like I'm complaining about this, right?

3244
03:23:46.60 --> 03:23:53.08
And and Dan's over there for, for a hundred days or whatever, with a freaking tube down

3245
03:23:53.08 --> 03:24:00.76
his throat. And he's not allowed to have one sip of water. So this is another one of those situations

3246
03:24:00.76 --> 03:24:06.44
where you just think, man, so nothing to complain about. There's so nothing to complain about.

3247
03:24:07.24 --> 03:24:12.44
And Dan just has a freaking awesome attitude. When he said that about when he woke up,

3248
03:24:12.44 --> 03:24:18.52
and did, you know, like no passage of time, like that, so I got a concussion, like a bad one.

3249
03:24:18.52 --> 03:24:23.56
The kind where you have Mnesia for a long time, like so basically it's like a super, super duper,

3250
03:24:23.56 --> 03:24:29.000
duper, duper, mild version of that experience. So so you basically been through the same thing.

3251
03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:35.64
It's a secondary link. So I, I, it was the NFL ball game. I hit this guy and then got knocked out.

3252
03:24:36.04 --> 03:24:41.80
But the knockout, like, where my body was limp only lasted for like, it was like a flash knockout.

3253
03:24:41.80 --> 03:24:46.92
So they helped me up and I was all like, we're, but everyone on my team saw me in new. I was like,

3254
03:24:46.92 --> 03:24:50.92
how, yeah, out of it. So they pushed, they put me to the sideline. Apparently,

3255
03:24:50.92 --> 03:24:55.88
I don't remember any of this part. So, but when I came to, I was just standing there in the sideline.

3256
03:24:56.28 --> 03:25:03.24
And it was weird because just like how he said, but I had Mnesia too though. That was a weird thing.

3257
03:25:03.24 --> 03:25:07.16
I didn't remember, and I don't even know where I was. Like the kind where I'm just outstanding here.

3258
03:25:07.16 --> 03:25:12.68
You know? But it's so, like, especially as a little teenager, right, it's high school time.

3259
03:25:12.68 --> 03:25:17.56
It's so scary because you don't, it's like, you don't know what's going on at all.

3260
03:25:18.12 --> 03:25:22.76
And nothing is like making sense or whatever. So, man, I just kind of broke down and started crying.

3261
03:25:22.76 --> 03:25:26.52
And my brother's like, then my brother's on the same team, obviously. He's like, kind of worried

3262
03:25:26.52 --> 03:25:30.36
and stuff. He's calling the trainer or whatever the doctor. And they're asking me all these questions.

3263
03:25:30.36 --> 03:25:34.20
And I'm like, I don't, I don't know anything. And it's weird. It's really freaky.

3264
03:25:34.76 --> 03:25:41.32
Know that? You're in the hospital? Man, man, I was feeling, I was like, that is crazy, man.

3265
03:25:41.32 --> 03:25:50.84
That's a crazy experience. The level of discomfort is like unimaginable. Right? Again,

3266
03:25:50.84 --> 03:25:54.84
you know, from you, I get a cut in my mouth and I'm like, like, can't he catch up for a week?

3267
03:25:54.84 --> 03:26:01.48
Whatever, he's just going to be staying. Right? And he's just, you know, lost his legs.

3268
03:26:01.48 --> 03:26:10.20
Got the freaking tube down as the nose. Having heinous, real nightmares that he thinks are real.

3269
03:26:10.20 --> 03:26:18.20
Yeah. Like, this is crazy. So, and then for him, I mean, can you, is there a nicer guy out there?

3270
03:26:18.20 --> 03:26:26.68
You know, this is nice. It's a nice guy. Humble, like, just freaking incredible. So,

3271
03:26:26.68 --> 03:26:31.000
he did say something. And he only said it real quick to and just continue to move on. But it

3272
03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:37.16
was a, it told a lot of the story on his little, on his mindset. And when he said, oh, when he

3273
03:26:37.16 --> 03:26:44.28
started, uh, I think we started sitting up. Right. And when he was considering, you know, before

3274
03:26:44.28 --> 03:26:49.72
he went into rehab, he said, okay, this is like my new sport. Right? So, whoo, I see what you did there.

3275
03:26:49.72 --> 03:26:54.52
And that's huge. That's a huge deal where you don't look at it as like, oh my gosh, I'm starting

3276
03:26:54.52 --> 03:27:00.84
from like, I was at 10 and now I have to go all the way back to one. It's not that. It's like a new sport.

3277
03:27:00.84 --> 03:27:06.04
It's like a new challenge that you can start from the year, almost like in a way, your original

3278
03:27:06.04 --> 03:27:11.40
starting spot because it's new to this sport. Just a new, it's a new sport. Yeah. Yeah. And then boom,

3279
03:27:11.40 --> 03:27:15.16
you kind of gamify it in that way where it's like, well, shoot, now I can sit up. Okay, now I can take

3280
03:27:15.16 --> 03:27:21.000
some stuff. Okay, I can use this and it's like this, this sport. Yeah. And it makes sense too, because

3281
03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:29.08
look at him. Paralympics no big deal. Yeah. Winning. That being said, you can gamify that stuff, but

3282
03:27:29.96 --> 03:27:35.16
at the end of the day, you can't get out of the game. And, and that's why you have to have

3283
03:27:35.16 --> 03:27:43.32
that, that like just incredible mindset to look at it. And, you know, when we had Jim

3284
03:27:43.32 --> 03:27:50.04
Srollsley on and, you know, he had he had lost both legs in one arm and Vietnam. And that, that

3285
03:27:50.04 --> 03:27:55.64
talk that he had with us after the podcast. When he was talking about Lewis, Pillar Jr. And he said that

3286
03:27:55.64 --> 03:28:03.24
Lewis, Pillar Jr. Never accepted 100% what had happened to him. And, and he's like, and I did.

3287
03:28:03.24 --> 03:28:08.60
And you could hear Dan talking about that today. You know, there's, you know, he said there was,

3288
03:28:09.16 --> 03:28:15.56
there was times he's talking past tense. Like it, there was times where he would be like, oh,

3289
03:28:15.56 --> 03:28:20.60
why did this happen to me? Oh, do I really think it was the, you know, he said this happened to me

3290
03:28:20.60 --> 03:28:24.68
because I could take it. And then he said, I question myself, did I really do I really think that?

3291
03:28:25.32 --> 03:28:30.68
And he was doing it in the past tense. So he got to a point and was like, okay, this is me,

3292
03:28:30.68 --> 03:28:34.52
this is my life. And what am I going to do? I'm going to go freaking kick ass. I'm going to

3293
03:28:34.52 --> 03:28:38.36
come in awesome athlete. I'm going to win a bunch of freaking Olympic medals. I mean, it's just just

3294
03:28:39.40 --> 03:28:46.04
just awesome, awesome example as a human. So anyways, honored to have him on here. Dan, thanks for

3295
03:28:46.04 --> 03:28:52.60

3298
03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:09.24
what discipline go energy drink. I've been drinking, I've been utilizing these a week. Oh, yeah,

3299
03:29:09.24 --> 03:29:13.88
and it's only the second. Highly productive though. It's so hard. So far we got a big one. You know,

3300
03:29:13.88 --> 03:29:20.36
I don't say, I don't run around saying I'm so busy all the time. I don't say I'm not busy, but I will say

3301
03:29:20.36 --> 03:29:25.32
this week. I'm a little bit busy. It'll be busy. Good. Good. So yeah, let me just go on a tough time. Yeah.

3302
03:29:25.32 --> 03:29:32.68
Uh, jockelfuel.com get get some bulk. That's a big one. Yeah. That's such a good little. It's almost

3303
03:29:32.68 --> 03:29:38.36
like a trick. It is like a trick that you can have something that tastes delicious and it's good for you.

3304
03:29:38.36 --> 03:29:41.56
You know, and it's providing you the protein that you need to get stronger. You know, the

3305
03:29:41.56 --> 03:29:46.04
expression, uh, if something seems too good to be true, probably is. Yeah. This one is not that. That's that.

3306
03:29:46.04 --> 03:29:51.88
That's not true. That's actually too good and true. It's good and true. Yeah. And I said it before

3307
03:29:51.88 --> 03:29:55.96
I'll say it again. That man, it's not especially if you're on the path you're lifting.

3308
03:29:55.96 --> 03:29:59.16
Lifting is a big one, but if you're if you're really working out and you're trying to get that

3309
03:29:59.16 --> 03:30:04.52
additional protein, it's hard to get they required recommended amount of protein. So I don't think you

3310
03:30:04.52 --> 03:30:12.36
think. So add to that one. Yeah. Easy now. How do you got that trick? Easy. No. Uh, jockelfuel.com. You can

3319
03:31:01.48 --> 03:31:10.44
Dan was jiu jitsu curious. He was really at the base real. I was out. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

3320
03:31:10.44 --> 03:31:16.12
Right as I was coming in. Well, he would made it a point and he was he was he was a really interested

3321
03:31:16.12 --> 03:31:19.56
to know how how do the tournaments, how the tournament set up. Yeah. Like, do you have this, you have

3322
03:31:19.56 --> 03:31:24.20
that and you're right. Like, right, we didn't, you came in and we had to kind of record. But I didn't

3323
03:31:24.20 --> 03:31:29.40
realize that. Yeah. They don't have, they don't have like a adaptive division. Yeah. Jiu jitsu is a

3324
03:31:29.40 --> 03:31:34.60
dancer. You just go. You adapt. Yeah. You figured out and by the way, like, what's your weight class?

3325
03:31:34.60 --> 03:31:42.28
Because Dan probably, if he had legs, would probably be 170. Yeah. So he's going to be in with some

3326
03:31:42.28 --> 03:31:46.60
120, eight pounders. I've known you. It was actually weight is, but he's definitely going to be

3327
03:31:46.60 --> 03:31:51.32
for his size and strength upper body is going to be forced to be reckoned with. Yeah. But there,

3328
03:31:51.32 --> 03:31:58.44
and there are, I want to say a lot, or there's not a lot, but it's not a rarity to be like, to

3329
03:31:58.44 --> 03:32:05.64
see a guy with one leg, no legs, competing in Jiu jitsu and winning. So there are like very

3330
03:32:05.64 --> 03:32:12.68
definitive, adaptive techniques that go in and are very effective in there. So yeah. To train

3331
03:32:12.68 --> 03:32:16.44
that Jiu jitsu. To train that Jiu jitsu is for everybody. That's the best thing about online.

3332
03:32:16.44 --> 03:32:20.60
That Jiu jitsu is for everybody. Where is it? Where do you get there from? I just said it today.

3333
03:32:20.60 --> 03:32:24.12
No, it's not. You said it right there with a little bit of an accent. No, you know why? Because

3334
03:32:24.12 --> 03:32:30.12
everybody, you can separate it into two words and you have a little pun, right? Everybody. Yeah.

3335
03:32:30.12 --> 03:32:36.36
And everybody. Back in the day, okay, remember Stuart Cooper. Yeah. So he did a video with

3336
03:32:36.36 --> 03:32:41.48
Hobbs and Mora. And that's what it was called. Jiu jitsu for everybody. And that's how he signed

3337
03:32:41.48 --> 03:32:46.04
it kind of like, I'm sorry. That was my favorite. So I'm talking about his video. Brazilian

3338
03:32:46.04 --> 03:32:52.12
Portuguese accent comes out from my youth. It's too. Also, Jockel Stork, you want to represent

3339
03:32:52.12 --> 03:32:57.16
way around the past. This one equals freedom shirts and hats and hoodies. Some good stuff to say good

3340
03:32:57.16 --> 03:33:02.04
and also some creative designs. If you want to know in every month as a subscription,

3341
03:33:02.76 --> 03:33:08.12
look at the last shirt. Lockership that came out the last one. Even though everybody must,

3342
03:33:08.12 --> 03:33:13.32
no, no, there's one. Yeah, but that's not the one. That's pretty much a virtual one. Yeah. What's

3343
03:33:13.32 --> 03:33:20.12
the most recent one? A good high level problems. Oh, dang.

3344
03:33:20.12 --> 03:33:27.88
You know, it's good road in like what do you call like a script, the real elegant script. Yeah,

3345
03:33:27.88 --> 03:33:33.08
with the logos. You got to do it. Why is it say high level problems? Because like, you know,

3346
03:33:33.08 --> 03:33:37.80
you know, what do you call the aristocrats? Right? That's all. Look. I don't know.

3347
03:33:39.80 --> 03:33:47.72
I'm just saying now here. You want to know the layers? Okay. So I always say we always kind of

3348
03:33:47.72 --> 03:33:53.32
talk about how like people now or it's been said that people now they're complaining about like

3349
03:33:53.32 --> 03:33:58.36
dumb stuff. Right. Everyone's offended or all this world problems. First world problems. Yeah.

3350
03:33:58.36 --> 03:34:03.48
Yeah. That's like the thing is sure it can be viewed as bad, especially when you compare it to real

3351
03:34:03.48 --> 03:34:08.76
problems, quote unquote real problems. But it's only natural to have these problems. And if

3352
03:34:08.76 --> 03:34:13.96
their problems, they still need to be solved. Most of them can be solved with attitude. Of course,

3353
03:34:13.96 --> 03:34:21.40
rather than, you know, killing a bunch of people. It's essentially, no, no, it means first world

3354
03:34:21.40 --> 03:34:27.32
problems need to be solved just like any other problem. No matter how easy or hard, but they still

3355
03:34:27.32 --> 03:34:32.52
exist. But you still have to have the same attitude. You got to have that. Good attitude. The same

3356
03:34:32.52 --> 03:34:38.68
good attitude. It's just a higher level could quote unquote higher level. Yeah. All right. So there you go,

with our own little platform that we've got going just in case we get banned. Just in case we get

3361
03:35:00.84 --> 03:35:08.84
censored. Yeah. What else? Band censored. Yeah. More. Bannis censored. Cazzled. Canceled.

3362
03:35:08.84 --> 03:35:15.08
Canceled. Whatever. I mean, I don't think, well, then again, I don't know nowadays. Because

3363
03:35:15.08 --> 03:35:21.48
remember, YouTube, you could say pretty much whatever as far as actual words. Like, you know how

3364
03:35:21.48 --> 03:35:25.24
they're swearing on YouTube. Yeah. That was never a thing. No. And then they're starting

3365
03:35:25.24 --> 03:35:31.72
like words that they like make it a point to like, bleep out so their channel doesn't get cancelled.

3366
03:35:31.72 --> 03:35:36.44
Like, there's people I listen to and they like cut out the words. I've heard that. But the words

3367
03:35:36.44 --> 03:35:42.12
that you're talking about are words like COVID. Have you ever heard podcasts like that when they're

3368
03:35:42.12 --> 03:35:48.44
saying the word COVID and they edited out? Yeah. Yeah. Or hat or like half the word. It's weird. So

3369
03:35:48.44 --> 03:35:53.32
that just makes me kind of weird. It doesn't make me nervous, but it makes me think like,

3370
03:35:53.32 --> 03:35:56.84
wait a second, why are they doing that? Because they might have got cancelled or demonetized

3371
03:35:56.84 --> 03:36:01.56
it. That's why we have joc on around.com. Because we can't control these other platforms.

3374
03:36:11.80 --> 03:36:17.24

3390
03:37:48.60 --> 03:37:53.24
aggro algorithm because it's looking to grab you right by the throat pull you back in. Actually,

3391
03:37:53.24 --> 03:37:57.88
it doesn't grab you by the throat. It grabs you by like, by like a gentle kind of like

3392
03:37:57.88 --> 03:38:02.76
handhold and it kind of lowers you in there. It's not aggressive. By the, uh, uh, what's the

3393
03:38:02.76 --> 03:38:08.52
br- a big dilla? Yeah. I don't know. It grabs you by the, by the gray matter, by the gray matter.

3394
03:38:08.52 --> 03:38:13.72
It just eases you into the algorithm. Next thing you know, you look up and you use wasted 17 minutes

3395
03:38:13.72 --> 03:38:20.28
of your life looking at a bunch of stupid things. So watch out for that. Uh, thanks once again to

03:38:20.28 --> 03:38:24.20
Dan Khanawson for coming on and thanks Dan for everything you've done.

3397
03:38:25.80 --> 03:38:31.80
Everything you've done for America for the teams and the way you represent America in the Olympics.

3398
03:38:31.80 --> 03:38:38.52
Awesome. And like I said, it's, it's awesome for for me to think that no matter what,

3399
03:38:39.40 --> 03:38:44.04
no matter what's going on in your world, you're out there getting after it. That is an example

3400
03:38:44.04 --> 03:38:51.24
for all of us to follow. And thanks to all the service men and women who have paid the price of

3401
03:38:51.24 --> 03:38:59.96
freedom in blood. We are only here because of your sacrifice. And we thank you for it. And thanks to

3402
03:38:59.96 --> 03:39:05.64
all the work done by our police non-forcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

3403
03:39:05.64 --> 03:39:10.28
correction officers, board of patrol, secret service, and all first responders out there.

3404
03:39:11.08 --> 03:39:16.44
You also sacrifice so that we can be safe and we are grateful for what you do

3405
03:39:17.40 --> 03:39:25.72
and to everyone else out there. Whatever, whatever excuse you have, whatever justification you

3406
03:39:25.72 --> 03:39:31.08
make up in your head, whatever rationalization you allow to go on in your mind to stop it.

3407
03:39:32.92 --> 03:39:41.64
To stop it. The excuses and the justifications and the rationalizations are not valid. And we know that.

3408
03:39:44.36 --> 03:39:51.000
We know that because of guys like Dan Khanawson who face incredible challenges,

3409
03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:59.56
but he doesn't make excuses and takes action. He overcomes, he drives on so let's all of us

3410
03:40:00.68 --> 03:40:09.64
be more like Dan and go out there every day and get after it. And until next time,

3411
03:40:09.64 --> 03:40:24.28
Zekko and Joko out.
