00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000 This is Jocco podcast number 72 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.80 Sir casualties are inbound. One of the myths has been hit hard and we have casualties headed to
00:00:22.80 --> 00:00:29.000 the Folusa surgical. My head snapped up from my work. I quickly strapped on my nine millimeter
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.44 and headed off to Folusa surgical. The level two trauma and surgical facility on Camp
00:00:34.44 --> 00:00:40.84 Folusa servicing the casualties and medical needs of the eastern portion of Alonbar province
00:00:40.84 --> 00:00:47.68 in Iraq. I had made a habit of going to the operating rooms to see and encourage the wounded
00:00:47.68 --> 00:00:57.08 whenever I was in the command post of two Expeditionary Force, MF, forward, at Folusa. My
00:00:57.08 --> 00:01:02.84 aid band and I made our way through the maze of buildings and walls of the camp something
00:01:02.84 --> 00:01:11.64 told me to hurry. I quicken my pace, then began to run. I hadn't done this before and I'm
00:01:11.64 --> 00:01:17.64 sure my aid was wondering what was up. As we rounded the corner of the hospital, I could
00:01:17.64 --> 00:01:23.64 see the up armored humvies of the mid team and the marine themselves standing near the entrance.
00:01:23.64 --> 00:01:33.12 They had their hands on their hips and their heads were down. This is bad, I thought.
00:01:33.12 --> 00:01:37.36 One of the Marines was lifting a set of body armor from the floor of a humvie and it
00:01:37.36 --> 00:01:45.84 was covered with and dripping blood. I quickly cleared my weapon at the clearing barrel
00:01:45.84 --> 00:01:51.64 and stepped into the facility. The medical personnel had become accustomed to my presence
00:01:51.64 --> 00:01:56.36 on these occasions and quickly briefed me on the situation. Several wounded one very
00:01:56.36 --> 00:02:03.64 seriously and the survivors were down the corridor in an office. I hustled down to the
00:02:03.64 --> 00:02:09.56 office and quickly got a situation report from the team leader and others of whom was wounded
00:02:09.56 --> 00:02:15.80 and waiting treatment. It had been a bad ambush and the Marines had fought for their lives
00:02:15.80 --> 00:02:23.60 alongside the Iraqi troops they were advising. Then looking up at me with an anguish you
00:02:23.60 --> 00:02:31.64 can only find in combat. The team leader said to me, in a hush tone, we think Travis
00:02:31.64 --> 00:02:40.64 is dead. I didn't immediately connect the name but I knew I needed to get down the corridor
00:02:40.64 --> 00:02:48.92 right away to the O.R.s with the incredible surgical teams working frantically on the wounded.
00:02:48.92 --> 00:02:55.44 As I stepped into the first O.R. the surgical team was just finishing their work. One
00:02:55.44 --> 00:03:02.44 of the nurses was crying openly. They had been unable to save this Marine and he had just
00:03:02.44 --> 00:03:10.000 died seconds before I stepped into the O.R. As I walked to the end of the gurney I was
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.80 stunned to see Travis Manion. The wonderful youngster I'd known as one of my midshipments
00:03:15.80 --> 00:03:23.80 while I was common-dont at the Naval Academy. I had known his family, his dad, Tom, a
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:31.64 Marine colonel himself and his mom Janet, a stalwart of the family. Travis had selected
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:36.52 the core from a nappeless and though I had not seen him during this first this tour in
00:03:36.52 --> 00:03:45.52 Feluca I'd heard repeatedly of his courage and bravery as an advisor. One by one the doctors
00:03:45.52 --> 00:03:52.20 and nurses left the O.R. leaving me alone with Travis. I don't think I had ever prayed
00:03:52.20 --> 00:03:58.000 so hard for anyone or anything in my life as I did while alone with him and that empty
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:11.52 O.R. His loss was very personal to me. Three years later while I was deputy commander
00:04:11.52 --> 00:04:17.92 at Centcom and headed ultimately to command the U.S. forces in Afghanistan I learned of
00:04:17.92 --> 00:04:24.20 an incident the previous night that had taken the lives of some of our magnificent special
00:04:24.20 --> 00:04:33.28 operators seals from Seal Team 3. They had been operating in the Zabu province south
00:04:33.28 --> 00:04:39.000 of the Hindu Kush and Afghanistan and had generally made the lives of the Taliban miserable
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000 the entire time they had served there. One of the finest young leaders in this Seal Team
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.44 Brendan Looney looked and lived every aspect of the ethos of being a seal. This now
00:04:53.44 --> 00:05:03.36 legendary strata of American special ops community. That night we lost Brendan Looney.
00:05:03.36 --> 00:05:08.84 As with Travis, Brendan's death was not simply a loss to their respective units and
00:05:08.84 --> 00:05:17.84 missions. Losing them was a terrible blow to America which would now never benefit from the
00:05:17.84 --> 00:05:26.36 extraordinary qualities of these two men. The irony of their relationship and their seemingly
00:05:26.36 --> 00:05:34.08 unrelated deaths was nearly as tragic. They'd been roomates at the United States Naval
00:05:34.08 --> 00:05:41.88 Academy growing up together at this most hollowed institution of our naval service.
00:05:41.88 --> 00:05:48.08 They had faced the challenges of Navy and had emerged committed in ways few can understand
00:05:48.08 --> 00:05:55.88 without experiencing the powerful formative forces of anapolis. And in their intense sense
00:05:55.88 --> 00:06:04.68 of duty and their desire to serve one sought to be a marine the other a seal. Remembering
00:06:04.68 --> 00:06:11.72 the times it didn't take a fortune teller to guess where this would lead them both to
00:06:11.72 --> 00:06:22.54 war in Iraq or Afghanistan or both into war it did lead them. Extracting from them long
00:06:22.54 --> 00:06:28.20 separations from their families as they grew into the full realization of their roles as combat
00:06:28.20 --> 00:06:40.96 leaders. But it also extracted from them their last full measure. Their young lives willingly
00:06:40.96 --> 00:06:50.02 sacrificed for their country than these causes.
00:06:50.02 --> 00:06:57.62 While Manion has done us a great service in initiating the effort to tell this story.
00:06:57.62 --> 00:07:04.26 Yes, it's about war but it's less a history of two wars than it is about the human experience
00:07:04.26 --> 00:07:11.78 of war and what this newest generation of American warriors has experienced. It ties together
00:07:11.78 --> 00:07:21.98 these precious young lives and they're growth together as warriors as leaders and as brothers.
00:07:21.98 --> 00:07:28.74 This book celebrates what we hear more and more frequently that these young Americans
00:07:28.74 --> 00:07:34.66 on whose broad strong shoulders we have fought two wars and we have kept the wolf from
00:07:34.66 --> 00:07:43.46 the door in a numerical other places are the new greatest generation.
00:07:43.46 --> 00:07:48.10 With less than 1% of our population in uniform fewer and fewer Americans bear the
00:07:48.10 --> 00:07:53.70 brunt of the responsibility for military service and fewer and fewer understand the sacrifices
00:07:53.70 --> 00:08:03.26 made by men like Travis and Brendan and their precious troops.
00:08:03.26 --> 00:08:09.74 All of us who fought in these wars now pray that in the end the outcomes will justify the
00:08:09.74 --> 00:08:17.82 costs to America and its allies. Those of us left behind must ensure these sacrifices
00:08:17.82 --> 00:08:28.78 were not in vain and that these lives lost will have meaning and purpose now and in the
00:08:28.78 --> 00:08:43.66 future. And that is the forward of a book called Brothers Forever and that forward was
00:08:43.66 --> 00:08:51.98 written by John Allen who's a retired four star Marine Corps general and the book which is
00:08:51.98 --> 00:09:01.18 about Travis Manion and Brendan Looney is written by retired Marine Corps Colonel Tom
00:09:01.18 --> 00:09:13.42 Manion. Travis is dead and we are honored today to have Colonel Manion on the podcast
00:09:13.42 --> 00:09:23.10 to give us some insight into the lives of these two amazing men. Colonel Manion.
00:09:25.42 --> 00:09:29.66 Welcome Man thank you so much for coming on. Thanks for having me here guys.
00:09:29.66 --> 00:09:40.38 I'm honored to have you on here and I guess with a story like this we might as well go a little
00:09:40.38 --> 00:09:47.26 bit back to the beginning and a lot of Travis's life and folks that listen to podcast
00:09:47.26 --> 00:09:52.22 or you may remember the name Travis Manion because when Bryan Stan was on he talked quite
00:09:52.22 --> 00:10:00.38 a bit about about Travis and how much Travis helped Bryan try to learn how to wrestle.
00:10:00.38 --> 00:10:06.22 Try. No offense Bryan he did his best to teach you but it was never your best skill set.
00:10:07.58 --> 00:10:13.18 But obviously wrestling was a big part of his life and I'm going to go to the book now and here we go.
00:10:13.90 --> 00:10:20.70 He attended classes, studied and wrote his papers but always thought wrestling would best
00:10:20.70 --> 00:10:29.26 prepare him for being a warrior and leader on the battlefield. This belief was reinforced by the
00:10:29.26 --> 00:10:37.98 qualities he saw in Captain Doug Zembeck, a two-time all-American wrestler of navy who attended
00:10:37.98 --> 00:10:42.22 as many practices and meets as he could and frequently sparred with Travis.
00:10:42.22 --> 00:10:52.22 Be a battle axe Zembeck told him, hurl yourself into your opponent. I think that's good advice
00:10:52.22 --> 00:11:00.54 just generally in life. That's good. Be a battle axe. Zembeck a 1995 naval academy graduate
00:11:00.54 --> 00:11:07.02 had a big impact on Travis. In the young wrestler's eyes the gritty tough seemingly invincible warrior
00:11:07.02 --> 00:11:13.10 embodied everything he wanted to become, a skilled marine officer who used the wrestling mat to develop
00:11:13.10 --> 00:11:19.74 himself into a leader who commanded respect. Travis was a high school in college wrestling star
00:11:20.78 --> 00:11:24.86 after a strong junior year at navy which featured several epic matches against
00:11:24.86 --> 00:11:29.82 nationally ranked opponents he was presented the naval academy's weams award for dedication and
00:11:29.82 --> 00:11:36.46 leadership. As a preseason top 20 wrestler going into a senior season Travis didn't want to
00:11:36.46 --> 00:11:44.30 simply win matches and meets he wanted to dominate and help lead the midshipmen to a championship.
00:11:45.58 --> 00:11:50.54 So we do talk about wrestling a decent amount because we're heavy into grappling.
00:11:51.74 --> 00:11:57.42 So he was just starting wrestling at a kit. Yeah he started really early. He youth wrestling
00:11:58.22 --> 00:12:03.58 up through high school but like a lot of these guys at navy he did a lot of different things he did
00:12:03.58 --> 00:12:11.18 football and and lacrosse as well but wrestling was the sport that he really gravitated towards.
00:12:11.18 --> 00:12:16.46 Yeah well there's something that makes people gravitate towards wrestling and combat sports
00:12:16.46 --> 00:12:21.18 in general especially if you're a guy that's in the combat. You know there's something that's
00:12:21.18 --> 00:12:27.50 beautiful about it. Yeah and so he's going now the Penn State Open it's like the 2004
00:12:27.50 --> 00:12:31.50 tournament is senior year he's got a hurt shoulder that he should hurt his junior year
00:12:31.50 --> 00:12:36.78 I'm going back to the book here the Purdue the Purdue wrestler slammed his struggling opponent
00:12:36.78 --> 00:12:41.74 the ground for a take down with Travis's injured shoulder something squarely on the red and yellow
00:12:41.74 --> 00:12:48.94 mat. His right arm was already numb and this first blow left Travis with almost no strength
00:12:48.94 --> 00:12:57.02 to attempt the scape in a sport built on hand-to-hand combat one hand is almost always no match
00:12:57.02 --> 00:13:06.86 for two the match ended in the 11 to 0 shut out and that's a senior year. Tough day tough year you
00:13:06.86 --> 00:13:14.94 know he had a great junior year and had a shoulder that was given on problems and instead of
00:13:14.94 --> 00:13:22.78 getting a second opinion he went under the knife and it was a disaster. So start out a senior year
00:13:22.78 --> 00:13:30.22 looking for it to a big year and could never get the shoulder going again and actually one the Penn
00:13:30.22 --> 00:13:39.82 State Open with that bed shoulder out and how he did it and the rest of the year. But yeah the
00:13:39.82 --> 00:13:44.22 year just didn't turn out well for him it's very very disappointing for him because he had worked
00:13:44.22 --> 00:13:50.62 so hard towards getting to the nationals and being an all-mark and any had everything going his way
00:13:50.62 --> 00:14:00.46 but you know the injury just just zapped him. And obviously zapped him and I can't I never put
00:14:00.46 --> 00:14:06.46 that much effort into a sport when I was in high school I didn't I didn't do it am I am I kind of
00:14:06.46 --> 00:14:12.86 a loser because of that little bit a little bit but I never was that you know into a sport and so
00:14:13.82 --> 00:14:18.38 but I saw people that I knew and he definitely see it in the once you get in the teams you meet
00:14:18.38 --> 00:14:23.10 guys and they put so much into that sport then something like that happens it's crushing I
00:14:23.10 --> 00:14:30.30 think this was a good little pickup that he got after brief moment of silence the assistant coach
00:14:30.30 --> 00:14:35.82 gave Travis a reason to perk up telling the future military officer that though he's seen senior
00:14:35.82 --> 00:14:42.14 wrestling season was over it was now time for him to devote all his energy to becoming a marine.
00:14:42.14 --> 00:14:48.86 Yeah and it's coach Joel Charities now the back at Navy went to Air Force for a couple of
00:14:48.86 --> 00:14:55.82 years and came back he's now the head coach down there but a great coach great mentor and
00:14:55.82 --> 00:15:01.74 by the way it was a good friend of Doug Zimbax too so it's like comes full circle and I want to say
00:15:01.74 --> 00:15:06.70 that the Joel would have been a warrior in the Marine too he was a national champ at Iowa three time
00:15:06.70 --> 00:15:11.58 finalists for Dan Gable if you know anything about wrestling. Yeah he's he's the real deal
00:15:11.58 --> 00:15:17.26 yeah that's awesome and and it's interesting because in the book here you know you kind of
00:15:17.26 --> 00:15:23.34 start off with that story and you can see some definite strength of character from from Travis
00:15:24.06 --> 00:15:31.10 and then you take a little back step and you talk about early in his academy a career he doesn't
00:15:31.10 --> 00:15:37.26 want to do it and it's he decides I don't want to stay at the academy I want to go to a regular
00:15:37.26 --> 00:15:42.30 college I'm out all right and he leaves and I thought one of the best things about this was
00:15:43.34 --> 00:15:48.62 you know when when when you talk to him about it and I'll go to the book here you know who
00:15:48.62 --> 00:15:53.18 Travis comes to you and says hey I'm leaving the academy and like I said in the beginning your
00:15:53.18 --> 00:15:57.26 marine you could I can't imagine you could have been any prouder than having your son go to the
00:15:57.26 --> 00:16:02.46 naval academy and then the disappointment you must have had when you said oh you don't want to go
00:16:02.46 --> 00:16:10.62 30 more but this is what you said to him go back to the book look this is your call and your decision
00:16:10.62 --> 00:16:16.46 Tom told his son who he always believed could excel with the naval academy and beyond
00:16:17.18 --> 00:16:26.14 but I think you're making a big mistake how did you know that one of the bad things you could
00:16:26.14 --> 00:16:31.82 done was like force him to stay there which you must have decided in your head like okay if I force
00:16:31.82 --> 00:16:37.42 him stay here he's gonna hate it and he'll be miserable and he won't put any effort into it I mean
00:16:37.42 --> 00:16:40.78 we I get asked all the time what would you do with your kids how much do you pressure him how did
00:16:40.78 --> 00:16:47.34 you come to that conclusion that that was the right move it's sort of how I always work with him you know
00:16:47.34 --> 00:16:54.54 I'm try to treat him you know as a man and let him make his own decisions give him advice coach him
00:16:54.54 --> 00:17:01.02 but at the end of the day he's gonna have to make those decisions and you know this was no different you know
00:17:01.02 --> 00:17:09.90 I was extremely disappointed but you know he I had a buddy there that was a batayan officer at the
00:17:09.90 --> 00:17:17.58 the naval academy and he gave him a hard time about leaving and that a major gardener yeah
00:17:18.30 --> 00:17:22.86 yeah lieutenant Colonel Gardner and in quirky gave him a hard time it's a time I'm not letting
00:17:22.86 --> 00:17:27.90 them leave let him go home for the holidays it changes mine and sure enough he came home and said
00:17:27.90 --> 00:17:33.66 you know I'm I'm going I'm leaving and I still remember quirky called me up and he said you know
00:17:33.66 --> 00:17:39.82 Tom if if he ever he did great here if he ever wants to come back you know he'll probably
00:17:39.82 --> 00:17:47.34 consider it I say quirky there's there's no ways coming back he's he's done and and sure enough
00:17:47.34 --> 00:17:54.06 you know I mean he came back to me later on that that following spring late spring we go to
00:17:54.06 --> 00:17:59.74 some other college yeah get a call from the wrestling coach come on down because I was given him
00:17:59.74 --> 00:18:05.18 so much trouble at home coach today you got a scholarship come on down so he left as soon as you
00:18:05.18 --> 00:18:11.58 could get out of the house and so you let him make his own decision you just made him pay for it on a
00:18:11.58 --> 00:18:20.86 daily basis so that's when when I didn't know that and I could not believe that they let him
00:18:20.86 --> 00:18:27.50 back in I mean that's awesome yes very very unusual and if you're out there and you're at the
00:18:27.50 --> 00:18:32.78 Naval Academy right now and I know I know you got quite quite a few listeners at the at the Naval Academy
00:18:32.78 --> 00:18:37.18 and at the and at West Point as well don't think you're going to get in that kind of treatment you
00:18:37.18 --> 00:18:40.94 need to just stay there trust me it's going to be worth it you ain't going to be fall travel's
00:18:40.94 --> 00:18:46.14 man you know this one now he pulled out the miracle and that one it really was has unbelievable
00:18:46.94 --> 00:18:50.06 and he gets back in I mean I guess with his wrestling skills because he did well
00:18:50.86 --> 00:18:56.54 did well academically did well on the wrestling team as a freshman but you know beyond anything else
00:18:56.54 --> 00:19:03.26 when he quit it's interesting because you know he he quit and he left and it made him really
00:19:03.26 --> 00:19:10.30 realize what he was missing yeah and when he went back into talk to people about going back he had
00:19:10.30 --> 00:19:15.26 the passion he knew exactly what he wanted to do and they could see it and you know I I would have
00:19:15.26 --> 00:19:21.10 conversations with guys that were kind of thinking about their their Navy career and there's a big
00:19:21.10 --> 00:19:25.58 there's a there's a transition that happens mentally with people and that is if they feel trapped
00:19:25.58 --> 00:19:28.78 they want to escape the minute that they don't feel trapped anymore then they're like oh what
00:19:28.78 --> 00:19:33.50 to go back in that cage so you got it if you can get them mentally out of the cage which is
00:19:33.50 --> 00:19:37.34 probably what what Lieutenant Colonel Garno was trying to do take go home for the weekend let
00:19:37.34 --> 00:19:41.26 see what it's like outside the cage and you're going to want to come back into the cage you didn't
00:19:41.26 --> 00:19:46.62 work that time but I'm always not a longer time outside the cage so when the guys would come to
00:19:46.62 --> 00:19:50.94 me and they'd say you know I'm thinking about getting out I'd say I wouldn't go no don't get out
00:19:50.94 --> 00:19:54.70 because then that's that's tightening the cage on them I'd say yeah man start looking what you can
00:19:54.70 --> 00:19:58.46 do on the outside you know why don't you go get a job there's some good jobs you know they got some
00:19:58.46 --> 00:20:01.90 good jobs you can get you know you can be an executive there's you know you could there's probably
00:20:01.90 --> 00:20:05.58 a good cubicle that would have a nice computer at it for you and everything I took but I would
00:20:05.58 --> 00:20:10.22 be not even be sarcastic about I just try and make them start thinking about what regular I mean
00:20:10.22 --> 00:20:15.10 you want to see all teams it's a ridiculously good life I mean it's it's a ridiculously good
00:20:15.10 --> 00:20:20.14 life so the minute you start looking at normal jobs in the world you want to get back in the cage
00:20:20.14 --> 00:20:28.70 so now he comes back and he ends up with a new roommate new roommate at the Naval Academy
00:20:29.50 --> 00:20:34.22 named Brendan Looney and I'm going to the book here Brendan and Travis who carried the burden of
00:20:34.22 --> 00:20:39.98 being division one athletes along with their academic and drilling responsibility rarely if ever
00:20:39.98 --> 00:20:47.02 complained just after the start of the 2001 fall semester Travis and Brendan met up from early morning
00:20:47.02 --> 00:20:52.30 run the restaurant football player both had practice later on that afternoon but as two varsity
00:20:52.30 --> 00:20:56.78 athletes who wanted to be the best they were determined to work harder than everyone else
00:20:58.22 --> 00:21:03.10 after talking about the start the NFL season their mid-job conversation shifted to their
00:21:03.10 --> 00:21:08.54 backgrounds they had a lot in common including the love of sports and their love of country
00:21:10.06 --> 00:21:15.34 both midship men had been raised Catholic the tight-knit families although Brendan's was a
00:21:15.34 --> 00:21:21.34 little larger with Brent Brendan had four a total of five I think total five siblings
00:21:23.02 --> 00:21:27.82 and so now we're introducing you know Brendan Moody into the into the story here and
00:21:28.54 --> 00:21:34.78 I actually knew Brendan slightly because when he was a seal he went through the training that I ran
00:21:34.78 --> 00:21:40.46 out here on the west coast for the west coast seal teams and just a stud you know that's you just
00:21:40.46 --> 00:21:50.06 a stud and the one thing I one of the things I remember about him was I was not you know the
00:21:50.06 --> 00:22:00.06 the most caring and affectionate instructor as a as a when I was running that training and
00:22:00.06 --> 00:22:05.74 he you know and guys would get little you know kind of freaked out sometimes when I'd be talking to him
00:22:05.74 --> 00:22:11.18 about the decision that they were making during the training and and he would just be smiling at me
00:22:11.18 --> 00:22:17.42 like yet hey sir got it makes sense sir you know with this mildest face just a stud just a straight up stud
00:22:18.38 --> 00:22:25.34 and so these guys are now fall 2001 and we know what's coming next September 11th comes
00:22:25.34 --> 00:22:32.70 and you know our country's under attack go into the book here and the entire naval academy student
00:22:32.70 --> 00:22:39.98 body realized that after graduation they would become part of a fighting force that was now at war
00:22:41.50 --> 00:22:46.14 and you know that's the whole military instantly thought that you know we were all thinking
00:22:46.14 --> 00:22:54.86 oh here we go yeah we had in 2004 it started to come home to us at Navy you know we had
00:22:54.86 --> 00:23:02.06 J.P. Blixmith with lost in the battle of Felicia around a windchester was lost over there around
00:23:02.06 --> 00:23:10.46 the same time both football players you know and now Travis has seen your year football teams coming
00:23:10.46 --> 00:23:16.86 out with the flag and they got Ronnie and J.P.s jerseys draped over the bench you know when it was
00:23:17.74 --> 00:23:21.98 it was coming home for all of us and he had guys like Doug Zimbeck coming back from the battle
00:23:21.98 --> 00:23:27.50 of Felicia and talking about what that was all about being in the wrestling room wrestling with Travis
00:23:27.50 --> 00:23:35.50 you know was was all over and Navy yeah that's a total game changer it was definitely like
00:23:35.50 --> 00:23:42.14 that in the sealed teams too you know we went from what was it years and years since Vietnam
00:23:42.14 --> 00:23:46.30 because we had some little you know there was Panama there was Granada there was some allia
00:23:46.30 --> 00:23:51.42 there were some things that happened but those were little flashes of combat action and all the
00:23:51.42 --> 00:23:56.46 sudden we were facing what's now turned out to be you know a decade and a half or more worth a war
00:23:59.26 --> 00:24:07.74 unbelievable these guys so you know as you said they're they're intensity it's just you know
00:24:07.74 --> 00:24:11.02 they might have been intense before but now their intensity is going to be through the roof
00:24:11.02 --> 00:24:16.30 yeah they know what's coming in May of 2004 Brendan and Travis graduated with their naval academy
00:24:16.30 --> 00:24:22.54 classmates and were commissioned as U.S. military officers Brendan would go to serve in the
00:24:22.54 --> 00:24:28.30 naval intelligence community while Travis would head to the basics school from Marine Corps officers
00:24:28.30 --> 00:24:36.06 in Quantico for Virginia so Brendan didn't get picked up for the sealed teams right out of
00:24:36.30 --> 00:24:42.06 right out of the academy which is fairly normal it's a really they only have a very small number of
00:24:42.06 --> 00:24:47.66 openings for guys from the naval academy and you can imagine how competitive it is to have a guy
00:24:47.66 --> 00:24:55.58 like Brendan not get picked up is crazy and so he goes out to go to go to the intel community
00:24:55.58 --> 00:25:01.42 and then Travis heads down to heads down to Quantico for the little bit of the basic school
00:25:01.42 --> 00:25:07.90 and and actually this was interesting and I I wasn't aware of this but the LaCross championships
00:25:07.90 --> 00:25:12.54 that those happen after they graduate they're see after they get commissioned the way it
00:25:12.54 --> 00:25:19.26 read in here it was like it happened after they got commissioned well it was it was actually it was
00:25:19.26 --> 00:25:24.38 the championship was after graduation that weekend the same same weekend he's been a lot
00:25:24.38 --> 00:25:30.86 of the weekend so and and Brendan at some point the naval academy started playing the cross
00:25:31.50 --> 00:25:35.10 yeah Brendan was a football player he went there was recruited for football
00:25:35.10 --> 00:25:43.90 and played football for a couple years dressed and played and decided that he wanted to go out
00:25:43.90 --> 00:25:49.34 for the cross both of his brothers are playing the cross and he went out there and just picked
00:25:49.34 --> 00:25:57.18 up a stick as you said earlier just such a natural athlete so gifted big strong and you know picked
00:25:57.18 --> 00:26:02.62 up a stick and by the time he was a senior in that championship game if you ask anyone who was
00:26:02.62 --> 00:26:08.06 the heart and soul that team it was number 40 Brendan Looney I mean he he led them all the
00:26:08.06 --> 00:26:14.30 way to the championship p and his two brothers were the the heart and soul the team yeah unbelievable
00:26:14.30 --> 00:26:18.62 and so they get to the championship game I'm going back to the book against Syracuse
00:26:18.62 --> 00:26:23.34 though navy followed with a goal Syracuse won its third championship in five years and eighth
00:26:23.34 --> 00:26:30.22 overall title Brendan was absolutely crushed by the 14 to 13 defeat this is supposed to be
00:26:30.22 --> 00:26:35.82 navy's day it would take some time for the loss to sink in but Brendan who had just played
00:26:35.82 --> 00:26:40.94 his final collegiate game and everyone associated with the navy program new deep down
00:26:41.50 --> 00:26:48.78 that the team's improbable final four run had been a truly amazing feat I don't think I've ever
00:26:48.78 --> 00:26:56.14 felt this low man Brendan grumbled we should have won that game I know Travis replied but don't
00:26:56.14 --> 00:27:01.18 do what I did to myself and wrestling what do you mean Brendan asked when I lost that
00:27:01.18 --> 00:27:07.90 match in Texas I thought my whole life was over I hadn't been that miserable since I quit the
00:27:07.90 --> 00:27:13.50 academy but there are bigger things out there think of what we're probably going to be doing
00:27:13.50 --> 00:27:21.66 a year or two from now so same thing you know a little bit of glory getting crushed right
00:27:21.66 --> 00:27:29.10 little glory getting crushed at the end there and you know Travis saying look man and this is
00:27:29.10 --> 00:27:34.70 true and I say this all the time you know sports with a ball and a referee and all that stuff
00:27:35.26 --> 00:27:39.26 it's a game you know and these guys are about to go into something that's no longer a game
00:27:40.54 --> 00:27:46.70 and that's where Travis recognized and and help Brendan see that going back to the book
00:27:46.70 --> 00:27:50.86 now that he was a young second lieutenant training at the basics school in quannico virginia
00:27:50.86 --> 00:27:55.98 was difficult for Travis to imagine that the months after graduation could be even more challenging
00:27:57.10 --> 00:28:03.50 but in fall of 2004 the harsh reality of war became more personal for Travis Brendan
00:28:03.50 --> 00:28:11.18 and their fellow naval academy graduates on September 2nd 2004 marine first lieutenant
00:28:12.78 --> 00:28:18.78 Ronald Winchester a driven popular former Navy football player became the first combat death
00:28:18.78 --> 00:28:24.14 in the naval academy's 2001 class when he was killed in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq's
00:28:24.14 --> 00:28:29.66 Alonbar province. Less than 48 hours later Travis and his fellow Navy wrestling
00:28:30.22 --> 00:28:35.26 alums were hit by another freight train upon learning that marine second lieutenant Brett
00:28:35.26 --> 00:28:41.66 Harmon a friend and teammate who had graduated in 2003 was murdered during a melee at a North
00:28:41.66 --> 00:28:49.82 Carolina State University football tailgate and that's a story that that Brian Stanton told as well
00:28:50.46 --> 00:28:57.10 what a tragedy that was I mean you know he was stepping in to help out and the guy came back and
00:28:57.10 --> 00:29:03.58 killed him and his friend was hit everyone hard Brett was a really popular guy
00:29:03.58 --> 00:29:12.70 and so coach Sharat he and again this is something that that Brian Stanton talked about
00:29:13.26 --> 00:29:20.30 you know when they were heading to the funeral and there we go let's do an exercise this is
00:29:20.30 --> 00:29:25.34 this is coach Sharat talking let's do an exercise I'd like you to both close your eyes and picture
00:29:25.34 --> 00:29:29.82 that you're leaving a building a friend picks you up and takes you to a place where people are
00:29:29.82 --> 00:29:35.74 somber crying and there seems to be an audience then you realize you're at your own funeral
00:29:36.54 --> 00:29:42.30 right down a few words about what you'd want a family member a person of faith to say when
00:29:42.30 --> 00:29:48.78 reflecting on the lives of Travis Manion or Brian Stanton Stanton nodded and after a few minutes
00:29:48.78 --> 00:29:54.22 of pondering what to write started drawing down a sentence about one day being remembered as a good
00:29:54.22 --> 00:30:02.22 husband or loving father and a US Marine Travis went through several pieces of paper before
00:30:02.22 --> 00:30:10.14 settling on one sentence Travis Manion was a man on a phrase to stand for what was right
00:30:10.14 --> 00:30:27.18 and as I mentioned earlier Travis started helping out Brian with his wrestling and
00:30:27.18 --> 00:30:32.54 and eventually as Brian started fighting because Brian's a maniac started doing MMA matches
00:30:33.58 --> 00:30:40.06 and he needed corner man so he needed to have the wrestling corner man and so again this is something
00:30:40.06 --> 00:30:46.78 that we covered with Brian's stand but for if you didn't hear it that first time there you
00:30:46.78 --> 00:30:51.82 got Brian's about to fight he's literally you know whatever 20 minutes half an hour from getting
00:30:51.82 --> 00:30:59.66 in the cage and fighting somebody and Travis gets a phone call and Brian can tell something's going on
00:30:59.66 --> 00:31:04.14 and Brian said hey tell me what's going on Travis says I'll tell you later
00:31:04.14 --> 00:31:13.34 Brian Stanton says you tell me now Travis looks away after the fight no give it to me straight
00:31:14.06 --> 00:31:22.38 Brian demanded what's going on and then Travis tells him JP Blacksmith was killed in
00:31:22.38 --> 00:31:33.90 Felusal last night so again your point is that these are people you know real close to home and
00:31:33.90 --> 00:31:38.54 it was tough for for Brian it's tough for anyone that's sitting on the sidelines which is what you
00:31:38.54 --> 00:31:42.46 feel like you feel like you can't you you want to help and you can't do anything you're back
00:31:42.46 --> 00:31:47.74 you're literally thousands miles away and that's what these guys are are feeling
00:31:47.74 --> 00:31:55.58 you a lot of frustration there but I think also at the same time it it built a lot of
00:31:55.58 --> 00:32:00.38 resolve with those guys I mean they were determined to make sure that they honored them
00:32:00.38 --> 00:32:04.70 in their service and work hard to to do all they could do to make a difference
00:32:04.70 --> 00:32:15.74 now there was a story told in here that I definitely wanted to go over because
00:32:18.22 --> 00:32:25.90 it revealed a little bit about Travis to me that was a little hard to pick up a little earlier
00:32:25.90 --> 00:32:31.74 and that was obviously that he was funny his health and didn't mind taking some risks so
00:32:31.74 --> 00:32:39.66 these guys are in a training situation and you know Travis was on the radio and he's given commands
00:32:39.66 --> 00:32:46.70 and he's given orders and they're being listened to by some higher-up training officer that's kind
00:32:46.70 --> 00:32:52.30 of monitoring what they're doing and so Travis is going back and forth on the radio with his
00:32:52.30 --> 00:32:57.58 guys they're doing some training and then as Travis pressed the button to on his radio to relay
00:32:57.58 --> 00:33:02.62 the final order allowed familiar voice suddenly overtook the frequency lieutenant this is
00:33:03.02 --> 00:33:08.38 coyote six the voice said I'm not really sure what you're trying to do out here but you're not following
00:33:08.38 --> 00:33:15.58 proper radio procedure sir Travis asked puzzle puzzle you need to figure out what you're trying to do
00:33:15.58 --> 00:33:21.58 because I sure as hell can't tell by listening to your orders over this radio the rising voice said
00:33:21.58 --> 00:33:31.82 do things right or do us all favor and just go home so okay Travis thinks about that and he
00:33:31.82 --> 00:33:38.54 just keys his radio and says yes sir so they're continuing they're doing a little bit more
00:33:38.54 --> 00:33:43.58 Travis has continued to direct his troops in this training operation and
00:33:43.58 --> 00:33:51.98 finally the voice comes on again lieutenant manion this is coyote six he said his dozens of
00:33:51.98 --> 00:33:57.58 eyes rolled I have a call I have to ask you a question son do you have any idea what the hell you're
00:33:57.58 --> 00:34:05.02 doing out there radio is dead silent for almost 30 uncomfortable seconds as everyone
00:34:05.02 --> 00:34:13.26 waited for the young second lieutenant's response no sir Travis said Travis said
00:34:14.70 --> 00:34:20.14 but I did stay at a holiday and express last night no for those of you that aren't the military
00:34:20.14 --> 00:34:25.82 when you key up on the radio it's not like I'm just cracking a joke to my boss did just me and him no
00:34:25.82 --> 00:34:32.46 there's like dozens and dozens if not you know 40 50 maybe even 100 people that just heard you say that
00:34:32.46 --> 00:34:41.58 so that was a positive comment funny risky but kind of showed in its classic it's great because
00:34:41.58 --> 00:34:45.58 that tells the guys hey look we're going to get through this we're going to push on we're going
00:34:45.58 --> 00:34:51.82 to make this happen so I thought yeah guys from first recon shared that story when they came
00:34:51.82 --> 00:34:57.18 came to our place and it was typical Travis you know and he said he just like everything got
00:34:57.18 --> 00:35:02.14 silent the coyote shut up and they said when they got back to the headquarters they wanted to meet
00:35:02.14 --> 00:35:09.50 this lieutenant he didn't catch me out from from coyote six on that coyote six got quiet that was it
00:35:09.50 --> 00:35:15.42 yeah he got punk so hard he just he just shut down he probably couldn't help but understand that yeah
00:35:15.42 --> 00:35:21.02 that was that was brazen but that was a good joke you know what you know it too I bet if he's a good
00:35:21.02 --> 00:35:24.70 guy and he's putting pressure on his troops he might have just seen him out of just sat back
00:35:24.70 --> 00:35:29.50 from his radio and just thought himself respect I've received that we got to respect what
00:35:29.50 --> 00:35:37.18 what's coming out from the holiday and express that's awesome so now we fast forward we get to
00:35:37.18 --> 00:35:45.82 Travis's first deployment and he's in alambar province and with first recon battalion and here we go
00:35:45.82 --> 00:35:50.86 as the first reconnaissance battalions maintenance management officer at camp fulusea his
00:35:50.86 --> 00:35:55.18 responsibilities which were focused on making sure vehicles were correctly allocated fuel
00:35:55.18 --> 00:36:00.54 and repaired were undoubtedly important but sitting on the sidelines while others went outside
00:36:00.54 --> 00:36:06.30 the wire to fight was definitely not what the marine had envisioned when he was back training so
00:36:07.34 --> 00:36:14.22 he got assigned as a logistics officer he did yeah he was he actually had
00:36:15.02 --> 00:36:21.26 intel officers his first choice because they have the sniper squads and he had infantry for a while
00:36:21.26 --> 00:36:25.42 and then he said you know what I think I'd like to work with a sniper so he switched it and he
00:36:25.42 --> 00:36:31.90 always thought since he switched it at the end that's how he ended up being a logistician so so he always
00:36:33.10 --> 00:36:37.82 you know was kicking himself for that but you know when he went out there started to work in
00:36:37.82 --> 00:36:43.82 logistics realize how important it was the mission I think he was still a little frustrated for sure
00:36:44.62 --> 00:36:50.54 but he started really integrate with first recon and actually Colonel Higgins the CO said look
00:36:50.54 --> 00:36:57.10 when you come back from this second tour we're gonna give you a recon battalion so he was pretty
00:36:57.74 --> 00:37:03.82 you know jazzed up about that and looking forward to to getting a recon battalion and you know
00:37:03.82 --> 00:37:08.06 it's part of why when he was over there as a mid team member he was doing the logistics
00:37:08.06 --> 00:37:14.86 as an advisor but also he was also taken the battalions out on patrols probably more than
00:37:14.86 --> 00:37:19.66 anyone over there I mean he was that's sort of the way he was I mean he was going to get ready so
00:37:19.66 --> 00:37:27.26 he was like okay another patrol I'm going yeah I got it it's I mean obviously logistics wins wars
00:37:29.98 --> 00:37:35.82 that being said I don't think Travis was a logistics kind of guy and in logistics they truly do I mean if you
00:37:35.82 --> 00:37:39.50 can't get bullets and beans you're not gonna win the war that's the way it is and that's one of the
00:37:39.50 --> 00:37:43.90 great things about the Marine Corps the way they do their spread and they put really high quality
00:37:43.90 --> 00:37:49.02 guys in every aspect of the Marine Corps including logistics but yeah I can imagine he was he was
00:37:49.02 --> 00:37:55.74 a pretty frustrated about that well frustrated and now the Marine Corps gives that an annual award
00:37:56.46 --> 00:38:01.26 to the largest edition of the year and it's the Travis Manion loader's decision of the year
00:38:01.26 --> 00:38:09.90 awards so well there you go okay that's all that's awesome you know and and Shirat Shirat
00:38:09.90 --> 00:38:15.50 is that how you pronounce his name? Oh sharet sharet okay sorry so sharet I thought this was another
00:38:15.50 --> 00:38:21.82 awesome piece of advice from from Sharet you know who you know Travis has reached out said hey you know
00:38:21.82 --> 00:38:25.58 it's it's great to be here I'm doing the best I can you know but I'm definitely getting frustrated I want
00:38:25.58 --> 00:38:32.22 to get outside the wire and Sharet says learn everything you can every second you can
00:38:33.10 --> 00:38:40.70 study the tactics study the people study the culture and know them more importantly know yourself
00:38:40.70 --> 00:38:48.06 and be vigilant not to let up on yourself preparing for the unexpected so that's just
00:38:48.06 --> 00:38:54.70 incredible advice you know and and doesn't matter what situation you're in you try and make yourself
00:38:54.70 --> 00:39:00.06 better you know and actually I work for for one of the senior seal animals that when September 11
00:39:00.06 --> 00:39:09.74 kicked off he was in charge of acquisitions at the Pentagon as a as a captain and you know
00:39:09.74 --> 00:39:15.02 here's everyone going to war and he's you know doing acquisitions which for those you
00:39:15.02 --> 00:39:20.38 don't military that means the limits of high level logistics and and something that he told
00:39:20.38 --> 00:39:25.66 me that always stuck with me was you know he was the same thing as as Travis he was frustrated
00:39:25.66 --> 00:39:30.86 he'll hear I am in the Pentagon every day and what he told me was you know what I said to myself
00:39:30.86 --> 00:39:36.06 Jochael this is my fox or I'm a fight you know so his fox holes in the Pentagon dealing with paper
00:39:36.06 --> 00:39:40.86 and that's what he did and he knew that he that was his that was what he had to do and how he's
00:39:40.86 --> 00:39:46.46 going to do it the best of his ability and and here in this from Shirat Shirat Shirat I want to
00:39:46.46 --> 00:39:52.54 get us now yeah well Jo was a great mentor you know he always had solid advice for Travis and the other
00:39:52.54 --> 00:40:03.82 guys that wrestle in maybe for sure all this being said about you know logistics being inside the
00:40:03.82 --> 00:40:09.34 wire logistics when you're running convoy's all the time those logistics guys army marine corps
00:40:10.14 --> 00:40:14.14 navy sea bees we had sea bees that ran logistics you're doing convoy's and your new
00:40:14.14 --> 00:40:19.90 convoy's do it down heavily laden i.e. deed streets so there was all kinds of logistics as a matter
00:40:19.90 --> 00:40:24.62 fact you know there's a lot of female logistics that deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan
00:40:24.62 --> 00:40:28.70 oh there's supposed to be in a non-combat role well guess what they got after they had to
00:40:28.70 --> 00:40:34.06 write in the middle of it all here in a convoy yeah so speaking that back to the book during one late
00:40:34.06 --> 00:40:39.10 night evening convoy through falusia the deafening thunder of an i.e.de shattered the relative
00:40:39.10 --> 00:40:43.34 tranquility of first reconnaissance battalion patrol the group of marine's have been attacked before
00:40:43.34 --> 00:40:48.06 but this is the first time that Travis was with them during a hostile incident keeping his
00:40:48.06 --> 00:40:53.50 composure while following orders of the more experienced officers Travis his heart pumping
00:40:53.50 --> 00:41:02.54 and ears ringing helped evacuate a marine who's wounded in the attack so again might have been
00:41:02.54 --> 00:41:07.98 in logistics but you're still those guys are out there right in the middle of it yeah exactly
00:41:11.66 --> 00:41:16.22 now he comes home from that deployment I'm going back to the book I rack changed newly promoted
00:41:16.22 --> 00:41:23.26 first lieutenant Travis minion for the better as the Marines mom dad sister and several naval
00:41:23.26 --> 00:41:28.70 academies buddies all noticed he was still the same Travis who had willingly traded doils town
00:41:28.70 --> 00:41:34.46 for one of the world's most dangerous places but after returning to the United States Travis
00:41:34.46 --> 00:41:40.46 carried with him at an aura of seriousness and quiet self confidence that was unfamiliar to some of
00:41:40.46 --> 00:41:47.34 his closest friends and loved ones when Travis talked about life he acknowledged its fragility
00:41:47.34 --> 00:41:54.86 having felt the pulse of an i.e.de blast and seen dead bodies in the streets for young marine
00:41:54.86 --> 00:42:01.82 who had just spent eight months in falusia it was almost impossible not to mature no matter what
00:42:01.82 --> 00:42:09.82 Travis was doing he was acutely aware that every single day Americans, Iraqis and Afghans were
00:42:09.82 --> 00:42:22.78 fighting and often dying I love the fact that that paragraph starts off by saying that
00:42:22.78 --> 00:42:29.02 that deployment to Iraq changed Travis for the better because so often you know we here
00:42:29.02 --> 00:42:34.94 and civilians get told and the public gets told that war does all these horrible things to people
00:42:34.94 --> 00:42:42.94 and and they fail to realize that in many cases war makes you a better person well you could
00:42:42.94 --> 00:42:47.82 you could definitely see the difference with Travis I mean he he went over there and eight
00:42:47.82 --> 00:42:54.54 months later he was a different guy I mean he was so much more focused and mature and and you know
00:42:54.54 --> 00:42:59.42 he had a chance to lead over there in these incredible situations where you have to make
00:42:59.42 --> 00:43:06.78 quick decisions and you know he he got a lot from it I could just sort of see it in the time
00:43:06.78 --> 00:43:11.10 I spent with him and the other thing about it I think is like appreciate what you have
00:43:11.66 --> 00:43:15.74 I mean I saw that so much from him you know when he was back here is just like wow
00:43:15.74 --> 00:43:21.82 this is the greatest place in the world you know there's no doubt about that that's something
00:43:21.82 --> 00:43:27.42 everybody that deploy comes back and you add a minimum you're gonna appreciate what we have in
00:43:27.42 --> 00:43:36.38 America things like bathrooms because over there you're you're only in a porta potty's right
00:43:36.38 --> 00:43:40.46 or you're in the field but you're in porta potty's in the summertime we used to call them the
00:43:40.46 --> 00:43:47.42 blue saunas because they're blue colored plastic right and then inside it's you know it's 120 degrees
00:43:47.42 --> 00:43:56.46 outside so inside the blue sauna it's you know 160 degrees and you don't want to leave the doors open
00:43:56.46 --> 00:44:02.38 because that's just nasty so you just leave the blue sauna shut yeah when you come home from that
00:44:03.58 --> 00:44:10.06 you get to a starter appreciate all things and meanwhile this time
00:44:10.78 --> 00:44:18.54 Brendan he now has gone to on a deployment to South Korea working as an Intel officer
00:44:18.54 --> 00:44:26.78 and doing that and even in doing that he felt like he had you know a lot more to do
00:44:27.98 --> 00:44:33.02 and this is when he focused on you know he wanted to be a seal but now he's going yes I need to be a seal
00:44:34.22 --> 00:44:38.62 he told his girlfriend who he had met while they were going to the Naval Academy Amy
00:44:39.98 --> 00:44:44.54 Amy I've got to do more Brendan said during a late night phone conversation
00:44:44.54 --> 00:44:48.06 Travis is there my other buddies are there and I want to be there with him
00:44:49.50 --> 00:44:53.90 when Amy reminded him of the dangers his friends like Travis were facing
00:44:54.62 --> 00:45:01.26 Brendan was undeterred I should be in the fight he insisted now there's an issue here
00:45:01.82 --> 00:45:07.42 and actually I was I talked about this how surprising it was that Brendan didn't get picked up
00:45:07.42 --> 00:45:12.54 for the seals out of the Naval Academy and I forgot the reason but there's a really distinct
00:45:12.54 --> 00:45:18.62 reason colorblind he was colorblind he was colorblind and you can't be colorblind in the
00:45:18.62 --> 00:45:23.02 seal teams at least you're not he's the first guy to get away from you're not supposed to be
00:45:23.02 --> 00:45:28.54 colorblind in the seal teams and that's why he didn't get picked up I still remember that call
00:45:28.54 --> 00:45:33.50 from Travis he said that got great news Brendan just got selected for the seals
00:45:34.22 --> 00:45:41.02 maybe seals just got one hell of a leader yeah that's that's awesome and before he got picked up
00:45:41.02 --> 00:45:45.66 and this probably helped him in you know back to the book in August 2006 Brendan deployed
00:45:45.66 --> 00:45:51.26 defluxia where he gathered and lies intelligence for combat missions including operations carried out by
00:45:51.90 --> 00:45:56.86 seals so actually I was in Ramadi at this time so Ramadi's I don't know 40 30 miles from
00:45:56.86 --> 00:46:03.02 defluxia and he was working he must have been working at our Intel shop
00:46:04.54 --> 00:46:08.78 and so the Intel he was gathering we would go out and prosecute those targets
00:46:08.78 --> 00:46:13.18 and he's working with working with seals and that that must have helped them out
00:46:15.02 --> 00:46:18.30 back to the book meanwhile Travis was making another visit to the east coast
00:46:18.94 --> 00:46:28.62 for the christening of his niece Maggie Rose so he's christening his daughter and also
00:46:29.58 --> 00:46:35.34 he found out now that he's going back to Iraq and this is another thing that he's sharing
00:46:35.34 --> 00:46:39.74 that news as the as as your granddaughters getting christened
00:46:39.74 --> 00:46:45.82 Travis is telling you hey I'm going back to Iraq and he's going back with the with the
00:46:46.38 --> 00:46:51.66 one is it the third battalion second brigade first Iraqi army division military transition team
00:46:51.66 --> 00:46:57.18 mid team I said that in the opening so little little bit about the mid teams
00:46:59.02 --> 00:47:04.86 I've talked about the various levels of comfort that you have in the military
00:47:04.86 --> 00:47:09.10 or that we had in Iraq and how you know us guys and the seal teams
00:47:10.30 --> 00:47:15.58 generally for the most part high level of comfort you know we would get to a place
00:47:15.58 --> 00:47:20.70 we would bring we would build a gym immediately we would have our CBs constructed gym if we didn't
00:47:20.70 --> 00:47:27.34 have one we would get you know we would get video or internet service we would live pretty good
00:47:27.34 --> 00:47:32.38 we'd get food ship then we would live pretty good now that being said of course there was
00:47:32.38 --> 00:47:37.42 a special ops guys that were way out the middle nowhere living on a fobs somewhere and that's
00:47:37.42 --> 00:47:43.90 living rough there were some people that were even more comfortable there were some headquarters units
00:47:45.42 --> 00:47:51.34 that had swimming pools I'm gonna say that again swimming pools so there's some headquarters
00:47:51.34 --> 00:47:55.74 areas you know if you got into the green zone and Baghdad you're yeah I'm on to pull him in
00:47:55.74 --> 00:47:59.74 Iraq I'm gonna head out to the swimming pool for a few minutes you know there's there's the there's
00:47:59.74 --> 00:48:04.30 those kind of living and then you get you know you got in in Ramadi we had the conventional guys
00:48:04.30 --> 00:48:12.94 that were living in the combat outposts in the city real rough living and then you go one step
00:48:12.94 --> 00:48:19.34 rougher and where you end up with his mid teams and mid teams so the the the stands for military
00:48:19.34 --> 00:48:31.02 transition team and this is when you are the direct advisor to an Iraqi battalion and in this
00:48:31.02 --> 00:48:35.42 case it was the three two one you're gonna hear me said about it's the third battalion second
00:48:35.42 --> 00:48:43.26 brigade first Iraqi army division so this is this is a battalion of Iraqi soldiers supposed to be
00:48:43.26 --> 00:48:48.30 six or seven hundred probably a lot less than that because they were generally highly undermanned
00:48:49.10 --> 00:48:56.06 but the mid teams had a really really hard job or an incredibly hard job it was you know we
00:48:56.06 --> 00:49:00.22 did advising to the Iraqi soldiers and we work with the Iraqi soldiers side by side and
00:49:01.50 --> 00:49:05.90 these guys did it not just on the battlefield but with everything that they did helping them with
00:49:05.90 --> 00:49:10.94 their pay helping them learn how to how to do the logistics side that you mentioned Travis was doing
00:49:10.94 --> 00:49:16.22 the mid teams just nothing but respect for the mid teams and on top of that we go out with the
00:49:16.22 --> 00:49:21.42 sealed teams you know we had great training and then we had other seals with us mid team we'd
00:49:21.42 --> 00:49:25.66 have we'd have a minimum usually of like six to eight seals with us and we got mid teams sometimes
00:49:25.66 --> 00:49:31.10 those guys are going out with one other mid team guy out with forty Iraqi soldiers
00:49:32.22 --> 00:49:37.98 poorly trained poorly motivated yeah they they lived right there with them yeah and they were
00:49:37.98 --> 00:49:45.18 totally embedded with them so yeah eating the same food tough job yeah horror I remember that
00:49:45.18 --> 00:49:50.78 the the call from Travis when it first heard that and I was just like wow you know much more
00:49:50.78 --> 00:49:55.90 comfortable as a dad with Travis with 200 Marines yeah the comfort levels the comfort levels
00:49:55.90 --> 00:50:02.70 incomparable yeah between being with 200 Marines and being with 200 Iraqis it's is completely
00:50:02.70 --> 00:50:08.70 it's the level of risk is so much higher there was a when there was a mid team that came out
00:50:08.70 --> 00:50:14.22 in a Romadi and they were turning over to mid team the ongoing mid leader and the off-going
00:50:14.22 --> 00:50:18.78 mid leader returned over they got attacked both of them got killed one attack that that's how much
00:50:18.78 --> 00:50:23.42 risk they're they're taking with these these mid team situations well the other thing about these
00:50:23.42 --> 00:50:29.98 guys is you know they were they were going out and in patrols with them and you know if they're
00:50:29.98 --> 00:50:36.14 going to train them the right way they were out front me one of the things with Travis last time I
00:50:36.14 --> 00:50:41.66 talked to him one of the last times at home I said Travis you're an advisor make sure you just
00:50:41.66 --> 00:50:46.94 tell the Iraqis what needs to be done and step back and let them execute and there's like okay
00:50:46.94 --> 00:50:52.06 that I got it and I knew I knew exactly you know what he was going to do he was going to lead
00:50:52.06 --> 00:50:56.38 from the front and that that's what he did you know that's what all those guys were doing they were
00:50:56.38 --> 00:51:02.14 you're you're out of patrol you're right out front with everyone else you know when the navy
00:51:02.14 --> 00:51:09.10 seals came back uh Erick Gratins was a navy seal with Travis and he said you know Travis was always
00:51:09.10 --> 00:51:22.06 there every patrol so yeah so that's what he gets tasked with and and I'll tell you what if you want
00:51:22.06 --> 00:51:26.38 to get some here in a mid team you know like you said you know you're going to go out patrols
00:51:26.38 --> 00:51:30.86 of the Iraqis you know you're going to have to there's no doubt about it's nothing but respect for
00:51:30.86 --> 00:51:36.14 the guys and we work with a bunch of mid teams in a body just outstanding guys doing a really
00:51:36.14 --> 00:51:42.06 really hard job yeah tough tough job well you know at the end of the day was strategically
00:51:42.06 --> 00:51:48.06 it was the the search right and they put everything behind the mid teams at that point you remember
00:51:48.06 --> 00:51:54.78 in 2006 2007 before Travis left he actually had a chance to talk to General Mattis came and talked to
00:51:54.78 --> 00:52:00.86 his mid team about how important that mission was so we're putting a lot behind our guys that were
00:52:01.90 --> 00:52:06.54 embedded with the Iraqis yeah and again for those of you that just a day into this strategic piece a
00:52:06.54 --> 00:52:15.18 little bit more our goal was to turn over Iraqis security to the Iraqis and and the only way to do
00:52:15.18 --> 00:52:19.02 that and we realize that's enough one of the things that made people realize the importance of the
00:52:19.02 --> 00:52:24.54 mid teams was you weren't going to do it you weren't going to educate them on how to do a combat
00:52:24.54 --> 00:52:29.58 patrol in the classroom you weren't going to educate them on how to do a combat patrol even
00:52:29.58 --> 00:52:37.10 on a training field you needed to take them out and teach them and and force them to go out
00:52:37.10 --> 00:52:43.58 into these things because the Iraqis if they have the the the the the opportunity to either stay on
00:52:43.58 --> 00:52:49.90 base or go out on patrol a lot of them would do it yeah they're there goal is to stay on base many
00:52:49.90 --> 00:52:55.18 of them and so of course there were some guys that were more motivated but a lot of them were just
00:52:55.18 --> 00:53:00.62 they just want to survive right they just want to survive so strategically that's what we had to
00:53:00.62 --> 00:53:06.94 do is we had to take them out and give them all the job training and simultaneously push them
00:53:06.94 --> 00:53:14.30 to to go out and try and lower some of the level of violence out in the various cities so
00:53:14.30 --> 00:53:22.62 yeah at this time also as you mentioned Brendan got approved for his for his lat transfers
00:53:22.62 --> 00:53:29.34 called a lat transfer and so now he knows that he's going to he knows that he's going to
00:53:29.34 --> 00:53:34.38 go to but's go to but's and and and be a seal or at least trying be a seal but I bet he was pretty
00:53:34.38 --> 00:53:43.90 confident yeah I'm certain of that one of the first things Travis did here he's he's going he's got
00:53:43.90 --> 00:53:50.14 a couple more days left he meets up with marine major Steve Cantrell and assistant navy
00:53:50.14 --> 00:53:56.46 wrestling coach and they go to New York Travis and Cantrell decide to spend a few days in New York
00:53:56.46 --> 00:54:01.18 city where Cantrell had arranged a visit to New York fire departments rescue one headquarters
00:54:01.18 --> 00:54:07.02 located in Hell's Kitchen rescue one had become a revered place over the past five years
00:54:07.90 --> 00:54:13.66 the small Manhattan building which was still fully functioning had been the home base for 11
00:54:13.66 --> 00:54:20.14 firefighters almost half the unit who were killed in the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks
00:54:21.26 --> 00:54:26.22 as they were leaving the firehouse one firefighter in former marine thank Travis for coming out
00:54:26.22 --> 00:54:31.98 Lieutenant Manion I want you to have these hats and shirts said the Marine Corps veteran
00:54:31.98 --> 00:54:37.58 no matter how crazy things get over there you can always put one of these on
00:54:38.30 --> 00:54:45.82 and remember what you're fighting for and he comes home and he's got that
00:54:46.86 --> 00:54:53.58 that rescue one hat with the with the rescue one fire department New York logo on the front
00:54:53.58 --> 00:54:56.54 and night 1101 never forget on the back
00:54:58.62 --> 00:55:04.06 then he says to you dad I want you to have this and please wear it while I'm gone no matter what
00:55:04.06 --> 00:55:07.02 happens always remember that this is what we're fighting for
00:55:08.30 --> 00:55:13.18 yeah I always remember that that discussion we had you know down the hallway
00:55:14.30 --> 00:55:19.42 and so impacted him to be there with those guys and he actually went up there to thank them
00:55:19.42 --> 00:55:25.42 for all they had done and he said dad they couldn't thank me enough for for my tour and
00:55:25.42 --> 00:55:32.14 what I was about to do and he was you know he he got real serious about it you know as
00:55:32.14 --> 00:55:38.06 remember that was one of the last conversations I had with him interesting side note to that story
00:55:38.06 --> 00:55:44.46 so my wife and I after we lost Travis went up to rescue one talk to the guys we were up there
00:55:44.46 --> 00:55:51.42 and they sort of remember maybe you know somebody coming through and but it never really clicked
00:55:52.06 --> 00:55:57.02 for the guys who were with but great guys and you know we end up leaving and never felt like
00:55:57.02 --> 00:56:03.98 we had the connection that we expected because Travis had talked about it so much and a couple
00:56:03.98 --> 00:56:12.46 years later I say about two years ago so what are you talking about like 7-6-7 years later
00:56:12.46 --> 00:56:17.90 well the books out and there's a New York City firefighter that gives his buddy the book and says
00:56:17.90 --> 00:56:23.34 hey read this book said mentions rescue one so the guys on the treadmill he almost falls off the
00:56:23.34 --> 00:56:29.58 treadmill says that that was me he had since been transferred so Tim Sullivan calls me up and says
00:56:29.58 --> 00:56:39.66 I'm the guy in the book I want to come up a beer with you yeah that's outstanding and that's also
00:56:39.66 --> 00:56:47.98 the same conversation where you told Travis you know hey you're an advisor advise and let the
00:56:47.98 --> 00:56:53.58 Iraq is execute which can be really hard it's you know can be hard because they won't execute
00:56:53.58 --> 00:56:58.22 it can be hard because you want to show them how to do it right and oftentimes if you don't
00:56:58.22 --> 00:57:09.02 lead from the front not gonna happen so I'm gonna have them there no so now your son and all Dave
00:57:10.30 --> 00:57:17.74 and Travis go to a football game and here we go back to the book as they reach a flight of stairs
00:57:17.74 --> 00:57:23.02 near the Lincoln Financial Field exit Dave with a clear hint of humor finally conveyed his
00:57:23.02 --> 00:57:27.66 concerns he was concerned you know he's concerned about him going overseas and he's just hey
00:57:27.66 --> 00:57:31.82 Travis I trip you right now and you fell down and broke your ankle do you think they let you
00:57:31.82 --> 00:57:37.50 sit this deployment out he asked Travis chuckle the Dave's joke but didn't say much in response
00:57:38.62 --> 00:57:44.46 a brief moment of slightly awkward silence followed while drunk and eagles fans shouted and
00:57:44.46 --> 00:57:53.26 chanted all around them suddenly Travis spoke up you know what though Dave Travis said with an
00:57:53.26 --> 00:57:59.34 honest day could we serious look on his face if I don't go they're gonna send another marina my
00:57:59.34 --> 00:58:09.42 place who doesn't have my training if not me Ben who you know what I mean he continued it's
00:58:09.42 --> 00:58:15.10 either me or that other guy who isn't ready so I'm the one who has to get the job done
00:58:20.86 --> 00:58:25.34 so think about that because you know you think back to the the time with coach Sharon
00:58:25.34 --> 00:58:31.50 and Brian stand and then they're in the plane and Travis says I want to be known as the guy that
00:58:31.50 --> 00:58:40.14 always you know step forward and did what was right if not me then who is another way to say it right
00:58:40.14 --> 00:58:45.50 and it's you know it's not I don't share that because it's unique to Travis you know I
00:58:45.50 --> 00:58:51.66 share that because it's and this whole story is really a representation is so many men and women
00:58:51.66 --> 00:58:57.26 in uniform you know it's their story but it's a story that can be told about so many
00:58:57.26 --> 00:59:04.14 and that if not me then who you know we we use that now at the foundation it's sort of drive
00:59:05.02 --> 00:59:10.54 momentum around you know what we all need to be thinking about as Americans stepping up and doing the
00:59:10.54 --> 00:59:17.10 right thing you know I'll agree with you 100% that there's a lot of people that say things like that
00:59:17.10 --> 00:59:27.58 but you know to have an example that someone that's so clearly live that is awesome to look at.
00:59:27.58 --> 00:59:32.62 Now we're getting ready for deployment back to the book more than 100 American troops were
00:59:32.62 --> 00:59:39.90 killed in Iraq in December 2006 including Major Megan McClung the highest ranking female officer
00:59:39.90 --> 00:59:48.54 to die in Iraq war in the Iraq war and the first female naval academy graduate to be killed in combat
00:59:50.78 --> 00:59:56.62 by the way that she was stationed in Ramadi I knew her and she was killed along with a
00:59:58.22 --> 01:00:07.26 another army specialist named Vincent Pumante their killed by big ID on routes sunset I think it was
01:00:07.26 --> 01:00:17.10 and also another guy was with her her guy named Travis Patrickwin who was just an unbelievable guy
01:00:18.38 --> 01:00:25.90 and this was a huge loss to lose to lose Travis and Megan in that ID
01:00:29.50 --> 01:00:36.70 any both of them and it was just just a huge loss never never knew her but I certainly meant her parents
01:00:36.70 --> 01:00:44.86 you know she's buried down in on in 10 sections 60 she was she was just like really
01:00:45.66 --> 01:00:50.46 just a huge smile all the time a real go get her just making things happen I didn't work with
01:00:50.46 --> 01:00:53.90 her you know I mean we'd see I'd see her at brigade meetings because we were both you know
01:00:53.90 --> 01:01:00.30 working with the one one AD and you know she was just yeah I got that and she was just really positive
01:01:00.30 --> 01:01:05.18 and and she was the thing I remember most about her was just her smiling you know she just
01:01:05.18 --> 01:01:11.10 always had a big smile on her face and and and Travis you know and I'm gonna do Travis story on
01:01:11.10 --> 01:01:17.90 here some day you know Travis was the guy he made this this PowerPoint brief for how to win the
01:01:17.90 --> 01:01:23.50 war in Iraq and it was stick figures and it explained like hey here's you you're an American here's
01:01:23.50 --> 01:01:28.46 this Iraqi and you don't know if this Iraq is good or bad but you know who does know these other
01:01:28.46 --> 01:01:33.02 Iraqis and it was just all these stick figures and it got published it got circulated that was
01:01:33.02 --> 01:01:38.14 Travis that was Travis Patrick and he spoke Arabic just a fantastic guy and I'll definitely
01:01:38.14 --> 01:01:47.42 cover there's that there was a book written about him as well so incredible people on on her
01:01:47.42 --> 01:01:55.98 at her grave site in section 60 it says be bold be brief be gone well she was indeed all those three things
01:01:55.98 --> 01:02:06.54 yeah going on here now major dug Zembeck the Naval Academy wrestler turned warrior whom
01:02:06.54 --> 01:02:16.86 Travis admired he was killed as well yeah there was shortly after we lost Travis a couple weeks
01:02:16.86 --> 01:02:27.90 later dug was over there and bagged in was killed yeah okay he was he I don't know if you knew him
01:02:27.90 --> 01:02:33.18 I didn't it's kind of a big personality at the Naval Academy and had the Marines in
01:02:33.18 --> 01:02:40.78 Foulouja yeah came back into the plane of Foulouja yeah yeah quite quite a leader and I really didn't
01:02:40.78 --> 01:02:47.50 know me there and Travis his junior year he was back wrestling with Travis at Navy they were
01:02:47.50 --> 01:02:54.14 about the same size dug was a big guy and and it's a guy behind the bench yelling and screaming
01:02:54.14 --> 01:02:59.82 like crazy as Travis is out there wrestling had a really tough match he ends up winning like
01:02:59.82 --> 01:03:05.90 one nothing against this kid from North Carolina I said Travis who is that guy behind the bench
01:03:05.90 --> 01:03:11.98 said that that's dug Zembeck you know who dug Zembeck so yeah that's when I first ended up at this point
01:03:11.98 --> 01:03:18.22 he hadn't been killed yet he was he was but the point that they were making here that I I kind of
01:03:18.22 --> 01:03:28.94 misworded was that he was a classmate of of Megamoclons apparently so that was the connection there
01:03:28.94 --> 01:03:37.58 yeah that was a couple that was what a couple weeks a couple weeks before before Travis arrives
01:03:37.58 --> 01:03:46.54 that you know he's getting this news yeah now Travis is back in Foulouja back to the book
01:03:46.54 --> 01:03:50.54 Travis had seen his share of blood but never needed to wash any from his hands that all
01:03:50.54 --> 01:03:55.42 chained and changed and January less than a month after he turned to Foulouja for his second
01:03:55.42 --> 01:04:03.34 deployment Travis and his fellow mid members went on combat patrols virtually every day
01:04:04.38 --> 01:04:10.70 sometimes running as many as three missions over punishing 18 hour span in Foulouja throughout
01:04:10.70 --> 01:04:14.94 Iraq marine soldiers sailors airmen and Iraqi troops did everything from hunting
01:04:14.94 --> 01:04:20.94 insurgents and weapons caches to disposing of dead bodies adding to three two one
01:04:20.94 --> 01:04:25.98 mitts challenges were joint patrols with the Iraqis through some of Foulouja's most dangerous sectors
01:04:26.70 --> 01:04:31.34 the Iraqi soldiers would sometimes respond to the slightest sign of violence with what some
01:04:31.34 --> 01:04:37.66 us team members nicknamed the Iraqi death blossom when a shot was fired in their direction the
01:04:37.66 --> 01:04:42.62 Iraqis would sometimes form a circle and fire in every direction with little regard for consequences
01:04:42.62 --> 01:04:48.22 including tragically catching innocent civilians in a crossfire civilian casualties were
01:04:48.22 --> 01:04:54.14 sometimes unavoidable reality of war but Travis and his fellow Marines were determined to use
01:04:54.14 --> 01:05:00.70 every means at their disposal to prevent them. While some mitt team members
01:05:01.82 --> 01:05:07.74 understandably became frustrated with the often untrained underpaid Iraqi soldiers
01:05:07.74 --> 01:05:13.82 Travis positioned himself as a mentor during lunch he would bring his child to their
01:05:13.82 --> 01:05:19.42 mess hall and sit with nick and Iraqi translator who helped bridge the gap between US and Iraqi
01:05:19.42 --> 01:05:26.70 armies they not only talked about combat strategy but also simple things like soccer
01:05:28.94 --> 01:05:32.94 so this is just pure professionalism that's what that is pure professionalism.
01:05:32.94 --> 01:05:37.90 I had a chance to go over to Iraq in 2010 and I met with the Iraqis that Travis served with
01:05:37.90 --> 01:05:46.38 and they said that Lieutenant Manu would always come over and sit down and eat with us and talk
01:05:46.38 --> 01:05:52.86 with us and it was part of what you needed to do right if you're going to be there and be
01:05:52.86 --> 01:05:58.22 there brother and help them with the mission they had you got to be part of what they're doing
01:05:58.22 --> 01:06:05.26 and he understood that I mean it's not like unlike Brennan would you know I mean when
01:06:05.26 --> 01:06:09.66 you're playing athletics you sort of get that teamwork piece you know you know if you're
01:06:09.66 --> 01:06:16.70 going to make it work you got to all be together. Yeah and it's the book makes it sound like
01:06:16.70 --> 01:06:22.70 fairly easy to do that it's not man it's hard there's a huge cultural difference between
01:06:22.70 --> 01:06:31.10 Iraqis and American and you know it's not that big of a deal but I'll tell you what going you know
01:06:31.10 --> 01:06:35.50 your your overseas the one time you can kind of relax when you get to sit down and eat your
01:06:35.50 --> 01:06:39.58 child and you're in the childhood and you're actually fairly well protected most of the time you don't
01:06:39.58 --> 01:06:44.70 have to worry about anything you you clear your weapon before you go in the childhood I mean it's
01:06:44.70 --> 01:06:48.78 it's usually a relatively safe place and you get to relax you get to be around all your
01:06:48.78 --> 01:06:54.86 American friends and it's good to to deny yourself that and now you're going into because you know
01:06:54.86 --> 01:07:01.34 at this time you don't you you can't give full trust to the Iraqis you're you're going to you know
01:07:01.34 --> 01:07:08.78 eating with them the conversations are still did it's just not this little thing it's a big deal
01:07:08.78 --> 01:07:14.14 it's it's it's it's a it's a big deal to make that extra effort and and clearly you know
01:07:14.14 --> 01:07:18.70 many times you know I'm I'm pretty engaged in my job you know many times I ate with Iraqis
01:07:18.70 --> 01:07:29.66 when I was in Iraq in my last appointment maybe twice maybe twice yeah maybe twice you know
01:07:29.66 --> 01:07:35.90 because you know when I was in a little bit I was in a different position but maybe twice yeah and
01:07:35.90 --> 01:07:40.86 you know at the end of the day they recognized that oh first when I went over they talked about that
01:07:40.86 --> 01:07:46.70 quite a bit with me and how they recognized that and how it was important to them and he knew that
01:07:46.70 --> 01:07:52.54 he absolutely did that's the point is that he he knew it he knew that making that sacrifice building
01:07:52.54 --> 01:07:58.70 those relationships that was his primary mission or at least one of his primary missions was to build
01:07:58.70 --> 01:08:03.66 relationships with these Iraqi soldiers so that they could get to know them so they could build trust
01:08:03.66 --> 01:08:09.90 and so that they would go out there and do their job so professional at all times and this is another
01:08:09.90 --> 01:08:15.90 really good example of of Travis Travis's leadership back to the book just as some US
01:08:15.90 --> 01:08:21.26 Marines became frustrated by the raw battlefield tactics of the Iraqis which could put all their
01:08:21.26 --> 01:08:28.54 lives at risks some Iraqi soldiers rolled their eyes when Americans gave them orders whereas previous
01:08:28.54 --> 01:08:34.30 Marine lieutenants had barked instructions that they Iraqi army leadership Travis took a different approach
01:08:35.02 --> 01:08:42.54 starting with a knock on the door of the Iraqi lieutenant Jallal good day lieutenant I was wondering
01:08:42.54 --> 01:08:47.74 if I could speak with you about the upcoming raid on the high value target in the industrial sector
01:08:47.74 --> 01:08:53.42 Travis said through the interpreter I was wondering what time you think you would like to execute
01:08:53.42 --> 01:09:00.94 our mission I think five PM would be a good time to leave Jallal replied my men had a long day
01:09:00.94 --> 01:09:05.98 and I don't want to keep them up too late okay Travis said but I'm wondering if you might consider
01:09:05.98 --> 01:09:11.66 leaving a bit later possibly after sunset my concern is that our presence during daylight could
01:09:11.66 --> 01:09:16.22 endanger neighbors who live near the house we're gonna strike not to mention little children
01:09:16.22 --> 01:09:21.34 who could be playing in the street respectfully lieutenant I wouldn't want to be the one to tell
01:09:21.34 --> 01:09:26.62 their parents that their son or daughter might still be alive if we had waited a couple more hours
01:09:28.22 --> 01:09:36.30 after a pause in a sip of water the Iraqi officer nodded the raid would not start until 8 PM
01:09:36.30 --> 01:09:42.94 so again real leadership and I talk about this all the time in here you know the real leaders
01:09:42.94 --> 01:09:48.94 aren't barking orders the real leaders are the ones that are flanking and using indirect approaches
01:09:48.94 --> 01:09:53.42 sure with the people that they're trying to influence and there's just a phenomenal example of that
01:09:53.42 --> 01:10:07.50 got some email here email coming from Travis sent it to you you know sent it to the family
01:10:07.50 --> 01:10:13.98 and and some of his buddies sent to bring in as well here we go all my job is definitely going well
01:10:14.38 --> 01:10:19.90 after all the horror stories we hear we heard about the Iraqi armoured army and their unwillingness
01:10:19.90 --> 01:10:27.02 to work with the myths they have been very open and willing to listen to advice creating an initial
01:10:27.02 --> 01:10:33.18 relationship with my counterparts was the right move and it has allowed me to help them start shaping
01:10:33.18 --> 01:10:39.42 operations there are many dedicated men in this army and it's been an eye opening experience so far
01:10:40.22 --> 01:10:46.38 the best IAs that's Iraqi army soldier the best IAs are definitely dedicated to their cause and
01:10:46.38 --> 01:10:53.10 have a warrior mentality that rivals some Americans however there are still those enemies out there
01:10:53.10 --> 01:10:59.98 that wish us to fail there's a lot of work left to do but the city is definitely at a different place
01:10:59.98 --> 01:11:06.62 that it was last year I really feel that is it is at a critical point where if the present situation
01:11:06.62 --> 01:11:13.50 continues to progress it could have huge positive impact in other areas also I found a good balance
01:11:13.50 --> 01:11:19.74 between my logistics job and my company advisor role although going on operations definitely requires
01:11:19.74 --> 01:11:25.42 a good amount of time I'm able to work with the batalion logistics officer on a fairly regular basis
01:11:26.46 --> 01:11:32.94 I also appreciate all the good food and gear that has been sent workouts and your support have
01:11:32.94 --> 01:11:38.46 definitely helped keep me going as I said before we're pretty busy if I wanted to take a
01:11:38.46 --> 01:11:43.98 minute to thank you guys for everything and keep you updated please continue to write and
01:11:43.98 --> 01:11:49.18 enjoy your updates as well take care and I'll talk to you soon to simplify Travis
01:11:50.30 --> 01:11:57.18 yeah I was one of his last notes home but you can see I mean he's a glass half full type of guy you know
01:11:57.18 --> 01:12:01.98 we're getting it done we're working hard we're going to make a difference you know that's
01:12:01.98 --> 01:12:08.86 sort of how he approached everything and that was what he was trying to share interesting thing also
01:12:08.86 --> 01:12:14.30 about the logistics role because when I was over there talking to the logistics guy that he
01:12:14.30 --> 01:12:18.62 worked with sort of in a kidding way he said you know lieutenant man he was a horrible logistics
01:12:19.42 --> 01:12:25.02 officer and they started laughing he said he's never he was always on patrol he was never there
01:12:25.02 --> 01:12:32.86 with us when we had to do logistics stuff so that's I guess that's expected
01:12:37.10 --> 01:12:43.82 now we're going back to the book the next morning Travis and his teammates are woke around 530 a
01:12:43.82 --> 01:12:49.18 m to a huge explosion a few minutes later they learned that observation post back dad a new
01:12:49.18 --> 01:12:55.98 makeshift base they had been working to set up in flusha was a pile of rubble they'd go to that
01:12:55.98 --> 01:13:00.30 location with gunfire initially surrounding them before a secure permanent was established
01:13:00.94 --> 01:13:07.66 Travis albino my saying that right albino albino and others spent the next eight hours
01:13:07.66 --> 01:13:11.74 entering and re-enering the rubble while their team members controlled the crowd outside
01:13:12.38 --> 01:13:16.78 for all they knew the rest of the bombed out complex could have crumbled or there could have been
01:13:16.78 --> 01:13:22.86 other bombs tied time to go off when the quick reaction forced arrived they went into the ruins
01:13:22.86 --> 01:13:29.90 anyway carrying a large flashlight Travis crawled into the rubble sweating profusely due to the heat
01:13:29.90 --> 01:13:36.54 which is exact exacerbated by small fires burning throughout the compound Travis dug through dirt sand
01:13:36.54 --> 01:13:43.74 and remnants of brick searching for trapped arackies Travis albino and their teammates recovered
01:13:43.74 --> 01:13:48.38 two injured irackies and two dead bodies from the attack site their selfless actions
01:13:49.18 --> 01:13:55.34 had an enduring impact on many of the irackies who bore witness so you know this is even in
01:13:55.34 --> 01:13:59.34 America when there's something when a bomb when a building is collapsing they don't you know
01:13:59.34 --> 01:14:04.86 it's really really risky to go in there and Travis is like no we're going in there might be survivors
01:14:05.58 --> 01:14:08.86 iracky civilians he has no idea or maybe they were military guys he has no idea he's no
01:14:08.86 --> 01:14:16.62 I need to know them he's gonna risk his life just to go and help them back to the book less than
01:14:16.62 --> 01:14:23.66 24 hours later Travis's ears were ringing after an IED blew up underneath his vehicle the blast
01:14:23.66 --> 01:14:29.50 jarring pounding force loudly and abruptly halted his vehicles patrol through the city's volatile
01:14:29.50 --> 01:14:35.74 eastern industrial sector Travis had encountered IED's during his first deployment and is recently
01:14:35.74 --> 01:14:42.46 as nine days earlier after ensuring that fellow Americans and irackies were uningered Travis looked
01:14:42.46 --> 01:14:48.54 down at the sandy street where the crude explosive device was buried see that wire Travis said to
01:14:48.54 --> 01:14:53.42 another Iraqi lieutenant that's a command wire and it's stretching towards that building
01:14:54.22 --> 01:14:58.70 gathered your men and follow me he said to the Iraqi before turning to his Marines you and the
01:14:58.70 --> 01:15:06.78 other guys cover us just in case there's snipers lieutenant why don't we just leave the Iraqi said
01:15:06.78 --> 01:15:12.14 to Travis because they'll keep planning bombs around here and kill more of my men more of your
01:15:12.14 --> 01:15:18.22 men and probably kill some kids Travis said so respectfully lieutenant I'm going over there to find
01:15:18.22 --> 01:15:24.38 out who's responsible with or without you after a brief pause the Iraqi lieutenant got three of
01:15:24.38 --> 01:15:29.98 his men and followed Travis as he traced the command wires origin rounding a corner Travis saw
01:15:29.98 --> 01:15:35.50 man in civilian clothes kneeling over what appeared to be a pile of grenades which along with
01:15:35.50 --> 01:15:40.86 the attached wires appeared to be some sort of booby trap without hesitation Travis squared up to
01:15:40.86 --> 01:15:47.82 confront the threat the Marines out on the street heard the pop of Travis's M203 grenade launcher
01:15:47.82 --> 01:15:53.02 and the subsequent explosion several ran toward the sound while others stayed to keep watch over
01:15:53.02 --> 01:15:59.18 the exterior the tall sweaty insurgent took off running now being chased by a fearless determined
01:15:59.18 --> 01:16:05.98 Marine Travis had the bad guy in his sights and he wasn't going to let him get away stop Travis
01:16:05.98 --> 01:16:12.86 shouted an Arabic while pursuing the suspect by the time the US and Iraqi reinforcements arrived
01:16:12.86 --> 01:16:17.90 Travis was dragging the frightened suspect down off a wall he had tried to scale and an unsuccessful
01:16:17.90 --> 01:16:23.50 attempt unsuccessful attempt to escape after body slamming him to the ground Travis put the
01:16:23.50 --> 01:16:30.46 insurgents hands behind his back then made sure he was taken in for questioning the suspect
01:16:30.46 --> 01:16:35.90 eventually led the mid team to a room not far from the booby trap which contained grenades and many
01:16:35.90 --> 01:16:42.62 more bomb making materials without losing any lives or ruffling more feathers in the Sunni onklave
01:16:42.62 --> 01:16:48.38 Travis had helped remove deadly weapons and another terrorist from Felus' streets
01:16:51.34 --> 01:16:59.10 yeah so when I heard that story when it was shared with me one of the other parts of it is that
01:16:59.10 --> 01:17:05.74 when Travis ended up catching this guy put a I guess a good rest of the move on put him down to ground
01:17:06.70 --> 01:17:11.50 the Iraqis actually wanted to take this guy out you know and he's like no you're not doing that
01:17:11.50 --> 01:17:17.74 okay we're taking him back you know and they figured we'll just take care of this guy right here right now
01:17:18.38 --> 01:17:24.30 yeah and they just he just got Travis got just got hit with an IED by the way
01:17:25.26 --> 01:17:28.70 it must have gone low order which means it must not have detonated properly
01:17:29.50 --> 01:17:34.38 because if you're in a humveen you can hit with a legitimate IED it hit your vehicle under your vehicle
01:17:34.38 --> 01:17:41.66 your chances to survival isn't great and and so to have this guy actually hit you with an IED that you're
01:17:41.66 --> 01:17:48.38 lucky enough to survive and then you catch him and then you know I bet you that I'm going to
01:17:48.38 --> 01:17:53.34 we could I wish we could find out if the if the Iraqis that saw this if we could find out what
01:17:53.34 --> 01:17:58.94 wrestling move here used to put this insurance on his back thinking superex. Yeah superex yeah
01:17:58.94 --> 01:18:06.94 hey you had a good headlock yeah I bet that was not a happy insertion at that point but you know
01:18:06.94 --> 01:18:11.98 this also the other thing I was good about this is it shows you how Travis had to lead from the front
01:18:11.98 --> 01:18:17.90 because like I said the Iraqis are just content to say hey let's just go back to base you know
01:18:17.90 --> 01:18:24.06 let's just leave that's that's very common for them and Travis has to lead from the front has to
01:18:24.06 --> 01:18:28.70 say no we're gonna stay you can stay here but I'm gonna go get these guys and you know kind of
01:18:28.70 --> 01:18:35.26 shame them and help them out yeah you know and he was doing that but he was also seeing that
01:18:35.26 --> 01:18:41.02 the result of that was progress that these guys were starting to take on more and more and that was
01:18:41.02 --> 01:18:45.26 important to even just the fact that they followed it you know but that's that's what they're doing
01:18:45.26 --> 01:18:49.58 and then what they do is they gain confidence and they say yeah you know we can do this too and and that's
01:18:49.58 --> 01:18:56.38 how you eventually turn over battle space to them yeah going back to the book half of world away in
01:18:56.38 --> 01:19:03.18 California Brendan was about to embark on his most difficult challenge since 9-11, Buds training
01:19:06.78 --> 01:19:11.74 so you know I just wanted to point out that while Travis is now back in Flusia
01:19:12.46 --> 01:19:17.18 Brendan has got his orders and he shows up at Buds and you know he trained super hard to get ready for it
01:19:17.90 --> 01:19:19.18 and and there we go
01:19:19.18 --> 01:19:26.54 while helping turn the tide in Flusia first lieutenant Travis manion wrote a letter to the
01:19:26.54 --> 01:19:34.06 intelligenceer one of his hometown newspapers in Bucks County Pennsylvania and here's that letter
01:19:34.06 --> 01:19:40.38 there are many views on our mission here however all I can say with certainty is that there are
01:19:40.38 --> 01:19:45.02 thousands of Americans over here working hard towards a positive outcome in Iraq
01:19:45.02 --> 01:19:51.66 every day I'm here I see great things being accomplished under harsh circumstances from young Americans
01:19:52.78 --> 01:19:57.66 I'm truly honored to serve the side these marine sailors soldiers in airmen
01:19:58.62 --> 01:20:03.50 I'm not sure the average American sees the positives these service men and women accomplish
01:20:03.50 --> 01:20:09.82 or even understands the sacrifices of their efforts however whatever course of action our leadership
01:20:09.82 --> 01:20:16.62 decides upon there are those in waiting ready to carry out the mission in support of our country
01:20:16.62 --> 01:20:19.74 and in defense of its people and their freedoms
01:20:21.10 --> 01:20:25.98 respectfully Travis manion first lieutenant united states marine corps
01:20:28.06 --> 01:20:34.30 yeah that sums sums it up totally for him I mean you know you always knew where Travis was coming from
01:20:34.30 --> 01:20:41.02 very straightforward and and I mean obviously I agree with him that's that's a lot of people don't
01:20:41.02 --> 01:20:47.58 understand and still don't a lot of people still don't understand the the positive things that
01:20:47.58 --> 01:20:51.74 were occurring over in Iraq the positive things the the simple
01:20:52.78 --> 01:20:58.30 haven't lunch with them the simple trying to prevent collateral damage you know that's been
01:20:58.30 --> 01:21:03.26 mentioned several times you know the Iraqi soldiers they get content somebody shoots at them they shoot
01:21:03.26 --> 01:21:07.90 360 degrees they don't care where it hits and they're doing everything they can to train them
01:21:07.90 --> 01:21:12.86 and and put some discipline on them so that they don't hurt those civilians so
01:21:13.90 --> 01:21:18.94 and the willingness you know you guys tell us what to do you guys give us give us the mission
01:21:18.94 --> 01:21:25.74 and we're standing here and we'll get it in the distance yeah yep so now we're looking at
01:21:25.74 --> 01:21:34.22 a mission in an area of fluja which is called the pizza slice and if you go look at a map of
01:21:34.22 --> 01:21:38.30 fluja it's really obvious to figure out where the pizza slice is I did I did actually
01:21:38.30 --> 01:21:43.74 did one operation my first deployment to Iraq in the pizza slice and they're looking at doing
01:21:43.74 --> 01:21:48.14 an operation there they got some intelligence that there's a bad guy there that they want to go
01:21:48.14 --> 01:21:54.38 and get and we're going back to the book after discussing the idea with several fellow officers
01:21:54.38 --> 01:22:00.46 including Travis major Kubicki let's say that right Kubicki yeah major Kubicki announced that a team
01:22:01.10 --> 01:22:06.46 would head into the pizza slice to follow up on new intelligence about the snipers where about so
01:22:06.46 --> 01:22:14.06 it's a sniper that they're going after an enemy sniper hopefully they could find the terrorist sniper
01:22:14.06 --> 01:22:19.58 who is shooting at US Marines Iraqi soldiers and civilians to American humvies would accompany
01:22:19.58 --> 01:22:27.10 two full vehicles of Iraqi army troops in one home v would be Kubicki albino and Kim
01:22:29.42 --> 01:22:35.50 they would be joined by the driver staff sergeant Paul Petty and the turret gunner
01:22:35.50 --> 01:22:42.78 staff sergeant Josh Wilson meringue and sagal seagull meringue and seagull seagull
01:22:42.78 --> 01:22:50.54 would ride in the second home v the driver would be staff sergeant Chad Marquette
01:22:50.54 --> 01:22:59.98 turret gunner corporal briner and Muhammad and Iraqi interpreter Travis and second lieutenant
01:22:59.98 --> 01:23:05.58 Scott Alexander a friend and fellow mid team member were supposed to go to a nearby school with
01:23:05.58 --> 01:23:12.46 Iraqi soldiers and hand out candy crans and coloring books to local kids Travis was excited about
01:23:12.46 --> 01:23:16.86 the mission because he cared about the Iraqis and loved to see the smiles on the faces of the
01:23:16.86 --> 01:23:22.86 kids so they got two operations that they're about to execute one of them is to go and hunt down
01:23:22.86 --> 01:23:27.50 this sniper and the other one is to go do some build some wind some hearts and minds hand it out
01:23:27.50 --> 01:23:36.62 candy the kids now Kim is one of the other nitt team officers he's the ops the ops officer
01:23:36.62 --> 01:23:41.10 that's that's who Kim is and we're going back to the book Kim who had smelled the ugly
01:23:41.10 --> 01:23:47.82 niss in the air when he woke up that morning had and had reed reed reed reed it his unneasiness
01:23:47.82 --> 01:23:53.02 just minutes earlier told Travis at the smiles of Iraqi school children would be a welcome site
01:23:53.02 --> 01:23:58.46 Kim was a brave marine who repeatedly distinguished himself on the battlefield but on this day
01:23:58.46 --> 01:24:05.50 he felt worn down fortunately he and Travis were close enough that he felt confident asking
01:24:05.50 --> 01:24:13.10 his friend to take his place on major kubikis pizza slice patrol team is it cool if I had over
01:24:13.10 --> 01:24:19.66 the school instead Kim asked no problem Travis replied his eyes lighting up because he knew
01:24:20.46 --> 01:24:26.54 this man he could help go find the sniper are you sure Kim insisted go ahead with Scott to the
01:24:26.54 --> 01:24:33.66 school Travis said we're all good thanks Travis Kim said I'll see you in a bit see you back here
01:24:33.66 --> 01:24:40.30 Travis said with a nod yes so never knew that story and when right in the book
01:24:40.30 --> 01:24:46.22 started to talk to Chris about that day and you know he said hey I've got something I want to share
01:24:46.78 --> 01:24:50.78 did I never has shared before and he mentioned that you know it was supposed to be meal in that
01:24:50.78 --> 01:24:57.26 patrol as you would take for him this would have come forward with that story but he and in
01:24:57.26 --> 01:25:03.74 Travis and Scott were really close and I know it had to be bothering him for a while and he
01:25:03.74 --> 01:25:16.06 he shared that so so they roll into the pizza slice which again this is just a dude's a picture in
01:25:16.06 --> 01:25:24.38 your mind what it looks like it's kind of your stereotypical combat Iraq city small narrow streets
01:25:24.38 --> 01:25:32.22 you know trash in the streets buildings really close together threats everywhere dirty run down
01:25:32.22 --> 01:25:41.26 wires everywhere it's just a it's kind of your stereotypical Iraqi combat city that's exactly what
01:25:41.26 --> 01:25:48.62 what it is in the pizza slice in Fouloujia they're in their perimeter and boom here we go to the
01:25:48.62 --> 01:25:53.42 book the enemy sniper pulled the trigger blasting what felt like a metal pipe throughout
01:25:53.42 --> 01:25:58.78 Bino's lower left album abdomen the bullet which ricochet off the corpsman's radio
01:25:58.78 --> 01:26:04.38 then tore through his left lung how Bino fell to his knees dropping his weapon and landing
01:26:04.38 --> 01:26:11.50 flat on his face in the sword trash filled streets mother fucker yelled petty who had gotten a thumbs
01:26:11.50 --> 01:26:17.34 up from the dock a split second before in an instant Travis and Kubicki started running toward
01:26:17.34 --> 01:26:23.58 the wounded corpsman casualty scream the court deterret gunner of the other American home v he was
01:26:23.58 --> 01:26:29.02 the only one in the vehicle that to see Albino go down everyone in the home v froze
01:26:30.06 --> 01:26:37.66 Iraqi a stun meringue yelled out response despite the sudden jolt of adrenaline their heart sank
01:26:37.66 --> 01:26:44.94 when they heard the gunners response it's dock he yelled opening fire ambush
01:26:44.94 --> 01:26:49.58 Travis reacted as soon as the first shot rang out he took off running towards wounded
01:26:49.58 --> 01:26:54.86 comrade as the thunder sound of American turret gunfire rang out the once quiet alleyway
01:26:55.58 --> 01:27:00.06 even with the enemy shooting above from above Travis didn't care about his own safety
01:27:00.78 --> 01:27:03.82 he knew he this could be his only chance to save dock
01:27:05.66 --> 01:27:11.98 at the other American home v rang and seagull also took off in Albino's direction
01:27:11.98 --> 01:27:17.50 though they were trained to never run towards a sniper's victim the warrior ethos have never
01:27:17.50 --> 01:27:21.34 leaving a fallen comrade behind had overridden their sensibilities
01:27:22.62 --> 01:27:27.66 Travis who reached dock first grabbed him by the left shoulder and Kubicki
01:27:27.66 --> 01:27:31.74 who was running close behind clutched Albino's right arm a few seconds later
01:27:32.86 --> 01:27:38.86 come on dock Travis yelled as he as he in the major pulled Albino closer to the home v
01:27:38.86 --> 01:27:44.22 bullets were now raining down from multiple rooftops which meant that more
01:27:44.22 --> 01:27:49.74 insurgents had been waiting with the sniper to ambush the American Iraqi and Iraqi troops
01:27:50.78 --> 01:27:56.70 the mid team was encircled by insurgents and without a fierce counter intact the entire patrol
01:27:56.70 --> 01:28:05.90 was almost certainly doomed as bedlim ensued the marines realized that both Iraqi vehicles in
01:28:05.90 --> 01:28:12.94 their patrol were gone after the Iraqi soldiers heard the gunfire the front vehicle subsequently hit
01:28:12.94 --> 01:28:18.94 an i.e. while trying to loop around towards a better fighting position the Iraqis were stranded
01:28:18.94 --> 01:28:25.66 which meant nine Americans and their interpreter were left outnumbered in a confined chaotic space
01:28:25.66 --> 01:28:38.70 yeah so you know with Travis that day you know he helped pull dock in docks said when I
01:28:38.70 --> 01:28:44.06 went to see dock at the but as the hospital he said you know I just felt this this big hand
01:28:44.06 --> 01:28:51.82 coming and grabbed me and pulled me in and they were surrounded there and you know with the
01:28:51.82 --> 01:28:58.78 sniper was there firing away I don't know if you're going to share but Chuck Segal was also wounded
01:28:59.82 --> 01:29:07.18 as he came in actually got an email from Chuck recently just to you know so many years later
01:29:07.18 --> 01:29:12.86 just to sort of talk about that day and what it was all about but you can imagine that the
01:29:14.06 --> 01:29:19.18 the cloud of war chaos confusion nobody really knows what's going on
01:29:19.18 --> 01:29:25.90 as I talked to the guys that were there that day nobody was really sure where things were
01:29:25.90 --> 01:29:30.94 coming from they just knew they were in big trouble yeah that's one of the hardest things about
01:29:30.94 --> 01:29:35.98 the urban environment it happened in all environments but in the urban environment you hear shots
01:29:35.98 --> 01:29:39.34 coming in you don't know where they're coming from it's very difficult to tell because the sound
01:29:39.34 --> 01:29:44.94 reflects and refracts off the different buildings and you know the sniper or the the shooters can
01:29:44.94 --> 01:29:51.26 be one or two rooms deep you just don't know where the where the rounds are coming from and it's
01:29:51.98 --> 01:29:57.26 just very very confusing a lot of confusion from from all the guys I spoke with
01:30:00.22 --> 01:30:05.02 going back to the book here Travis and Kubicki dragged Albino out of the kilzone
01:30:05.02 --> 01:30:09.26 and closer to the vehicles front side where the sniper couldn't deliver a fatal blow to their
01:30:09.26 --> 01:30:16.30 bleeding gasping corpsmen as they tended to Albino's wounds Travis saw meringue and Seagull
01:30:16.30 --> 01:30:23.58 running toward him at full speed another piercing crack of gunfire abruptly echoed through the alley
01:30:24.30 --> 01:30:30.62 in an instant Seagull was somersaulting in midair feeling like Mike Tyson had just punched him in the
01:30:30.62 --> 01:30:37.90 stomach and landing in the middle of the bullet riddled street all around Seagull who broke his rifle
01:30:37.90 --> 01:30:43.90 wall collapsing the ground a hectic battle was unfolding in an eerie slow motion silence
01:30:45.18 --> 01:30:49.98 Seagull's wrist convulsed with tremendous pain the sniper was firing at the wounded marina's
01:30:49.98 --> 01:30:54.54 delay in the street and the young lads corporal who had just been shot in the wrist and still
01:30:54.54 --> 01:30:59.66 unbeknownst to him also in the stomach would soon be dead if he didn't get in front of that home v
01:31:00.70 --> 01:31:06.46 as Seagull laid powerless unable to do anything but wait for the crushing blow of another sniper bullet
01:31:06.46 --> 01:31:14.46 Travis pulled him out of the sniper's crosshairs moments later Seagull laid next to Albino
01:31:14.46 --> 01:31:23.74 who was still being worked on by Kubicki so again you know if you got a sniper scenario
01:31:23.74 --> 01:31:30.22 and there's a guy down the last thing you want to do is run over to try and help get him out of that
01:31:30.22 --> 01:31:35.66 situation unless you're Travis and then that's the first thing you're going to do.
01:31:39.26 --> 01:31:46.30 By the time the confused lands corporal looked up into the dust Travis was gone he'd already run
01:31:46.30 --> 01:31:52.46 back into a cloud of bullets Travis dashed across the street not far from where Seagull had been hit
01:31:52.46 --> 01:31:58.38 twice in meringue had barely escaped death without blinking he blasted her grenade onto the
01:31:58.38 --> 01:32:02.14 one of the rooftops buildings sending chunks of concrete tunneling of ground.
01:32:02.78 --> 01:32:08.54 When Travis switched to M4 rounds his suppressing fire was equally relentless which gave Kubicki
01:32:08.54 --> 01:32:13.90 and meringue enough time to help ballooned it. With one rooftop silent after stunned
01:32:13.90 --> 01:32:18.54 insurgents had experienced the crushing power of Travis's grenades and countless M4 rounds
01:32:18.54 --> 01:32:24.70 the battles tied begin to turn. Seagull and Albino couldn't see Travis firing but they could
01:32:24.70 --> 01:32:30.78 hear the welcome sounds of the American counter attack which only paused when Travis needed to reload.
01:32:33.58 --> 01:32:38.70 Go! Travis screamed to his fellow officers who moved into new positions so they could join him in the
01:32:38.70 --> 01:32:43.18 fire in firing at the enemy. Travis moving east in the alleyway from the homevee's
01:32:43.18 --> 01:32:49.02 pastor side to the driver side as he blasted away at another rooftop was now causing the same kind of
01:32:49.02 --> 01:32:54.86 pandemonium among the enemy that the sniper had initially brought on the Americans. Justin front of
01:32:54.86 --> 01:33:00.30 Seagull, the corpsman initially pulled to safety by Travis and Kubicki dragged himself
01:33:00.30 --> 01:33:05.98 almost completely under the vehicle with only his legs sticking out. Desperately trying to breathe
01:33:05.98 --> 01:33:10.62 while tasting a mixture of sand and his own blood Albino was almost certain he was going to die.
01:33:12.38 --> 01:33:18.14 A middysiness, extreme thirst and the crashing sounds of concrete, the wounded corpsman pictured
01:33:18.14 --> 01:33:25.10 his mother when he didn't want to suffer in the wake of his death. But at the same time Albino
01:33:25.10 --> 01:33:31.10 could see Travis boots, Travis's boots firmly planted in the sand while he fired at enemy positions.
01:33:32.14 --> 01:33:36.22 The situation was bleak but maybe there was still a chance to survive.
01:33:39.34 --> 01:33:44.94 So you got Travis, it's interesting they use the word counter attack.
01:33:44.94 --> 01:33:51.34 And usually when you think of a counter attack you think of a platoon or at least a squad
01:33:51.34 --> 01:33:58.30 that's maneuvering to counter attack an enemy. And in this situation we got a one man counter attack
01:33:58.30 --> 01:34:05.02 that's the initiative. This Travis stepping up, putting down suppressive fire, putting down grenade fire,
01:34:06.06 --> 01:34:08.14 exposing himself to the enemy to make that happen.
01:34:08.14 --> 01:34:14.46 Well, trying to build them will manage the other way because the momentum is coming in.
01:34:15.74 --> 01:34:23.34 So much so on the other side that you got to sort of get out and get it on them, get the rounds on
01:34:23.34 --> 01:34:31.18 them to have them lose that momentum. Yeah and just like any military unit, the insurgents,
01:34:31.18 --> 01:34:35.10 if they have the upper hand they're going to press but the minute you can press them back and
01:34:35.10 --> 01:34:39.74 you get the upper hand the chances are they're going to retreat because they're not holding the
01:34:39.74 --> 01:34:44.46 ground. They don't care if they lose ground. They'll run away. They want to live their cowards.
01:34:45.10 --> 01:34:52.22 And so they'll back away but if you don't do that, if you don't step up and you don't take
01:34:52.22 --> 01:34:58.86 the initiative they will absolutely overrun them and they'll overrun you. And so Travis, one man counter
01:34:58.86 --> 01:35:04.62 attack here and then he's yelling to his teammates, hey go help out. Let's go. Let's make this happen.
01:35:05.42 --> 01:35:11.50 Back to the book. Although the sniper would usually have been long gone by now. The AK47
01:35:11.50 --> 01:35:17.02 fire from other buildings caused so much initial confusion that the mid team still wasn't sure
01:35:17.02 --> 01:35:23.58 which building he had fired from. Like a vulture circling is prey. The enemy marksman continued
01:35:23.58 --> 01:35:29.66 scanning the alley before spotting Travis who's firing away on another rooftop. So this is a
01:35:29.66 --> 01:35:35.58 cover and move situation too where the sniper's taking precision shots but the guys can't really
01:35:35.58 --> 01:35:39.50 identify because they're getting shot at from a bunch of different locations as well.
01:35:42.78 --> 01:35:49.02 Back to the book. Across the city, first lieutenant Kim was handing crayons to smiling Iraqi kids
01:35:49.02 --> 01:35:54.22 with second lieutenant Alexander. Though Kim wondered how Travis and the guys were faring inside
01:35:54.22 --> 01:35:59.18 the pizza slice, they had been through so many battles in the last five months without a casualty
01:35:59.18 --> 01:36:06.54 that the mid team seemed indestructible. As Kim knelt with a happy child, he suddenly heard
01:36:06.54 --> 01:36:12.78 unintelligible screaming from the radio inside his vehicle, contact yelled a voice, possibly
01:36:12.78 --> 01:36:17.10 staff sergeant Perry, the driver of the Humvee Kim was originally supposed to be in.
01:36:17.10 --> 01:36:23.18 Kim looked straight at Alexander who had heard the same front exams and both men motioned to
01:36:23.18 --> 01:36:26.22 their Iraqi counterparts to sit with the kids while they check things out.
01:36:27.26 --> 01:36:32.70 The transmission, the transmissions were broken but now the sound of petty's voice screaming
01:36:32.70 --> 01:36:38.14 contact came through crystal clear. About saying a single word about what to do next,
01:36:38.14 --> 01:36:42.38 Kim and Alexander jumped in a separate vehicles with their respective drivers told the
01:36:42.38 --> 01:36:48.46 Iraqis to handle the rest of the school supply drop and spread towards the pizza slice and its
01:36:48.46 --> 01:36:54.86 unknown turmoil. As they listened to broken radio transmission and tried to communicate with Perry,
01:36:54.86 --> 01:36:59.10 who was frantically trying to contact camp solution, requested quick reaction force. The
01:36:59.10 --> 01:37:05.26 marine silently navigated through the pizza slice's narrow confusing streets, not completely
01:37:05.26 --> 01:37:11.50 sure of where their mid team brothers were pinned down. They knew a battle was raging but neither
01:37:11.50 --> 01:37:16.54 marine had any idea how serious it was nor did they realize Albino and Seagull had been hit.
01:37:18.38 --> 01:37:23.42 After looping around the pizza slice, the two vehicles turned right onto route Elizabeth near
01:37:23.42 --> 01:37:29.10 the blackwater bridge, heading east and the seriousness of the situation slapped Kim and Alexander
01:37:29.10 --> 01:37:36.06 in the face. The normally bust bustling, packed marketplace was completely empty.
01:37:37.10 --> 01:37:40.70 If tumble weeds had blown across the street, this section of Felicia would have looked exactly
01:37:40.70 --> 01:37:45.18 like a deserted town in an old western spaghetti. Jesus Christ Alexander said,
01:37:45.18 --> 01:37:49.74 where the fuck are they Kim yelled in frustration? Suddenly they heard gunfire. There,
01:37:49.74 --> 01:37:54.62 Alexander said pointing at the besieged alleyway where the two American homies were still being
01:37:54.62 --> 01:38:02.38 riddled by bullets. As both marine stopped on route Elizabeth facing east, the marine's
01:38:02.38 --> 01:38:07.90 jumped out and ran as quickly as they could, ducking rifles, ducking as rifles continued to crack
01:38:07.90 --> 01:38:14.06 towards their comrades. Kim then confronted an image that would stay with him for the rest of his life.
01:38:15.34 --> 01:38:20.14 Travis was lying near the back of the driver's side tire of the humvee he had been riding in
01:38:20.14 --> 01:38:27.26 his eyes wide open but glazed over with emptiness. Kim saw no blood but it was obvious that
01:38:27.26 --> 01:38:35.10 something horrible had occurred in that rich, violent alley. For the first time in the entire deployment
01:38:35.10 --> 01:38:40.62 sheer panic seized Kim as he ran with Alexander up to Kabiki who is kneeling by Travis while
01:38:40.62 --> 01:38:46.30 filing firing his nine millimeter handgun at one of the buildings after running out of rifle ammunition.
01:38:48.94 --> 01:38:55.42 Kim asked firing his own rifle where do you need us to go? Get the wounded Kabiki said,
01:38:55.42 --> 01:39:02.70 get them out of here. Who else has hit Alexander said, see go and dock. Kabiki said before moving
01:39:02.70 --> 01:39:09.42 to another position to continue firing. Swinging open the passenger side, back door for cover as he
01:39:09.42 --> 01:39:14.94 fired Kim saw a seagull who had avoided being shot again but was still in great pain lying in the
01:39:14.94 --> 01:39:21.66 back seat. Despite being on his back he was reaching down to the floor trying to find more ammunition
01:39:21.66 --> 01:39:28.70 for the turret gunner. His left wrist was breathing profusely. The major order is out.
01:39:28.70 --> 01:39:33.66 Kim said, do you need help? I can make it Seagull said, you got to get Lieutenant Manion.
01:39:34.70 --> 01:39:40.46 I think he's dead. My vehicle is right over there. Kim said pointing toward
01:39:40.46 --> 01:39:47.26 rattle is a bit go. Now that reinforcements had arrived the sniper was gone and the insurgents
01:39:47.26 --> 01:39:53.74 were pulling back. Seagull mustering all his strength, exited the humvee on the passenger side
01:39:53.74 --> 01:39:58.78 and hurried to Kim's vehicle where he collapsed in the back seat. He knew he had been shot in the
01:39:58.78 --> 01:40:05.18 stomach by this point and wasn't sure if you would make it. But even Seagull ran to the intersection.
01:40:05.18 --> 01:40:10.14 Even as Seagull ran to the intersection the wounded Marines thought were focused on the unforgettable
01:40:10.14 --> 01:40:17.50 scene he had just witnessed. Seagull didn't see Travis get shot by the sniper. But after dragging
01:40:17.50 --> 01:40:22.70 himself to the driver's side of the vehicle the Lance Corpel was shocked to see the first lieutenant
01:40:22.70 --> 01:40:28.06 lying face down in motionless. His arms stretched toward the curb with his feet facing toward
01:40:28.06 --> 01:40:34.86 the bullet riddled vehicle. When Seagull pulled himself towards Travis and asked him where he'd
01:40:34.86 --> 01:40:42.38 been hit he got no response. He realized Travis was seriously wounded and started feeling underneath
01:40:42.38 --> 01:40:47.34 his fellow Marines body armor with his left hand despite the hole in his own aching wrist.
01:40:47.34 --> 01:40:55.82 He found a bullet wound on the left side of Travis's rib gauge. He whispered in Travis's ear.
01:40:56.94 --> 01:41:03.34 Hey Travis said Seagull, Seagull, who normally would have addressed him as lieutenant or Sir.
01:41:03.34 --> 01:41:12.54 I'm here for you. Travis didn't respond. Even without realizing that the sniper's bullet had
01:41:12.54 --> 01:41:17.74 struck the first lieutenant from the right side and had exited at the spot he was covering with his left
01:41:17.74 --> 01:41:24.94 hand. Seagull knew the situation was grave. When Travis began jerking with convulsions.
01:41:26.86 --> 01:41:31.26 Is he dead? Kabiki yelled over to Seagull while continuing to fire at enemy positions?
01:41:32.46 --> 01:41:39.10 Not yet but he will be if we don't do something. The Lance Corpel said his voice shaking.
01:41:39.10 --> 01:41:43.82 Seagull turned to Travis. Whose eyes were still wide open.
01:41:46.22 --> 01:41:49.58 I'm here for you Seagull, repeated over and over again into his ear.
01:41:52.78 --> 01:41:57.26 As soon as Kim and Alexander had carried their unresponsive friend into the vehicle,
01:41:57.26 --> 01:42:01.58 Kabiki ran over and dove into the smoke-filled home-view where he clutched Travis and began trying
01:42:01.58 --> 01:42:05.74 to identify his wounds, stopping the bleeding, and performed CPR.
01:42:05.74 --> 01:42:10.70 He ordered petty to start driving towards Camp Felicia while Wilson
01:42:10.70 --> 01:42:18.14 Wilson fired the last rounds from the turret. This was probably Kabiki's last chance to save his fellow
01:42:18.14 --> 01:42:25.58 Marine. As four vehicles, spread toward Camp Felicia, Father John Gaten,
01:42:26.62 --> 01:42:31.34 a Marine Corps chaplain from Pennsylvania, sat in his tiny office on the make-ship
01:42:31.34 --> 01:42:37.02 American base. He was reading emails from home while sipping from a large water bottle to keep
01:42:37.02 --> 01:42:44.22 hydrated on the steamy Sunday afternoon. A few minutes later, his phone rang. We got two wounded
01:42:44.22 --> 01:42:48.70 in action, and one possible killed in action arriving at the field hospital, a North Roo
01:42:48.70 --> 01:42:56.14 Unnurs reported. As the Marines ran over to the wooden complex, he saw a group of Marines.
01:42:56.14 --> 01:43:02.86 Kim, Alexander, Kabiki, Morang, Petty, Marquette, Wilson, and Brianer
01:43:03.90 --> 01:43:10.06 huddled like a team on a football field. As he jogged by one of them turned around and looked at him.
01:43:11.34 --> 01:43:16.62 Father John saw the redness in the eyes of this Marine who had obviously been crying.
01:43:18.54 --> 01:43:21.02 It was clear that something terrible had happened.
01:43:21.02 --> 01:43:27.98 Any Marines with typo positive blood reported immediately to field hospital room four,
01:43:27.98 --> 01:43:29.66 a voice set over the loudspeaker.
01:43:35.10 --> 01:43:44.38 As they tore off, as they tore off his bloody fatigues before finding the wounds on each side of
01:43:44.38 --> 01:43:51.10 his rib cage and trying to resuscitate him, crowds began to form in the hallway outside the operating room.
01:43:51.66 --> 01:43:57.74 Word was quickly spreading. That first lieutenant Travis Manion, the heart and soul of the
01:43:57.74 --> 01:44:14.86 mid team was badly wounded. Yeah, he gave it all. He gave it all that day. He gave it all
01:44:15.74 --> 01:44:21.10 every moment he was over there and working with the Marines, working with the Iraqis and
01:44:21.10 --> 01:44:34.94 and that last event. He ran out of ammo. I was talking to the gunner and
01:44:36.70 --> 01:44:41.82 start to ask him about what he saw, trying to figure out, you know, the, we've got what was
01:44:41.82 --> 01:44:46.06 written up and as a warden, just trying to get some insights and the gunner said, you know,
01:44:46.06 --> 01:44:53.58 lieutenant was calling for more ammo. So I'm thinking that Travis, I saw when he was over there,
01:44:53.58 --> 01:44:58.62 he had all sorts of magazines. So I don't know how many rounds that I'm guessing around
01:44:59.58 --> 01:45:06.30 maybe 90 to 100 rounds he had on himself and he'd actually laid down a lot of fire to change the
01:45:06.30 --> 01:45:13.18 moment. But I, you know, he knew what he was doing. He exposed himself. He had to do that to
01:45:13.18 --> 01:45:20.38 get out there and laid down the fire. And when I spoke to the gunner, Wilson, he said, you know,
01:45:21.02 --> 01:45:24.86 we threw out a magazine. I turned around when I turned back Travis's land on the ground.
01:45:26.14 --> 01:45:33.74 So maybe he was trying to get that magazine and, and load it into his weapon. He'd run out of
01:45:33.74 --> 01:45:41.18 all of his ammunition and laying cover for these guys. Yeah, and like you said, I mean, just,
01:45:41.18 --> 01:45:46.78 somebody had to turn the momentum. Yeah. Otherwise they were going to get overrun. Yeah, and he knew
01:45:46.78 --> 01:45:56.30 that. He knew that. If not me, then who? You know, he knew what he had to do. I know that
01:45:57.50 --> 01:46:04.06 because they had lost, I got to let her from Kibicki shortly afterwards and he said, you know,
01:46:04.06 --> 01:46:08.78 we're using Travis's words to go on because he, they had lost some guys and he had pulled the
01:46:08.78 --> 01:46:13.02 team and it said, look, we got to, they'd want us to go on. We got to keep working. We got to
01:46:13.02 --> 01:46:19.66 turn the tide here. And so he used that session that Travis had with the team and said, look,
01:46:19.66 --> 01:46:22.70 you know what Travis would think? You know what we got to do? We got to keep fighting on.
01:46:24.22 --> 01:46:25.02 And that's what they did.
01:46:25.02 --> 01:46:43.50 Father John, anointed Travis's feet and said a prayer has the medical staff tried feverously
01:46:43.50 --> 01:46:45.58 to revive him.
01:46:45.58 --> 01:46:59.26 The phone number the Marine could show the doctors some sign any sign of life soon after the
01:46:59.26 --> 01:47:07.10 physician in charge announced a time of death. For the next minute, the only sounds heard in the
01:47:07.10 --> 01:47:14.14 operating room came from the hallway outside as doctors and nurses watched in silence,
01:47:14.14 --> 01:47:18.38 Father John standing above the fallen US Marine broke the silence.
01:47:21.50 --> 01:47:25.50 God, the Father of Mercy's through the death and resurrection of your son,
01:47:26.22 --> 01:47:33.50 you have reconciled the world to yourself and sent a Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of
01:47:33.50 --> 01:47:39.90 sins. He said, looking down at Travis through the ministry of the church,
01:47:39.90 --> 01:47:52.62 May God grant you pardon and peace. And I absolve you of your sins in the name of the Father,
01:47:52.62 --> 01:48:10.30 kind of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. One by one, Marines filed past their fallen brother,
01:48:12.06 --> 01:48:17.74 Kabiki, the senior officer who desperately administered CPR in the humvee was the first to walk by,
01:48:17.74 --> 01:48:26.70 Marine was next then Wilson, Marquette, and Breiner. When Petty looked at the fallen first
01:48:26.70 --> 01:48:33.18 lieutenant's face, he saw an officer who had given everything to the Marine Corps.
01:48:35.82 --> 01:48:39.74 When Alexander approached the operating table with tears streaming down his face,
01:48:39.74 --> 01:48:47.18 he put his hand on his friend's head. He didn't know how the mission could carry on without him.
01:48:49.58 --> 01:48:56.22 Kim approached the table with weak knees and a broken heart. He paused to take one last look at
01:48:56.22 --> 01:49:03.10 his friend who had saved his life by volunteering to go on a patrol. He knew would be far more dangerous
01:49:03.10 --> 01:49:14.14 than a school supply drop. Pauzing for a moment, Kim pondered the story that was already
01:49:14.14 --> 01:49:21.42 spreading throughout the hospital complex without thinking twice. Travis had left squarely
01:49:21.42 --> 01:49:25.18 into enemy crosshairs to direct gunfire away from his patrol.
01:49:25.18 --> 01:49:37.10 On April 29, 2007, a line of the Iraq war was struck down by a single bullet.
01:49:39.58 --> 01:49:44.54 Cut through Travis's Aorta, causing massive internal bleeding that couldn't be controlled.
01:49:47.98 --> 01:49:54.54 Though the fallen Marines loved ones, would undoubtedly suffer everyone else on the pizza slice
01:49:54.54 --> 01:50:05.26 patrol was still alive. Indeed, by fearlessly protecting his Marines and the Iraqi serving beside them.
01:50:07.02 --> 01:50:10.86 First Lieutenant Travis Manion had done his part.
01:50:10.86 --> 01:50:25.98 Yes, so clearly in writing this, it's sort of as a father obviously really tough to
01:50:27.10 --> 01:50:32.94 to go through and talk to the guys that were with them and relive that.
01:50:32.94 --> 01:50:41.18 But the other side of it is it's a little healing, did this sort of no exactly what was going on
01:50:42.70 --> 01:50:48.14 with the guys that were there with him, felt about his actions that day.
01:50:48.14 --> 01:51:01.34 And so as I went through the struggle of times, when I realized that unless we tell these stories
01:51:02.78 --> 01:51:06.14 the rest of the country is not going to know what these guys are doing.
01:51:07.18 --> 01:51:11.50 So we got to make sure that we get the word out there and there was a big part of it
01:51:11.50 --> 01:51:18.70 is sitting down and talking through that day, a big part of the struggle for me and putting this book together.
01:51:21.26 --> 01:51:26.94 And you just, I mean, it's a, I would say it's a miracle that everyone else lived.
01:51:26.94 --> 01:51:32.62 But it's actually just Travis that everyone lived in a situation like that, surrounded by enemy,
01:51:32.62 --> 01:51:38.06 a sniper, multiple enemy positions firing on you. You got nine guys and two on these.
01:51:38.06 --> 01:51:42.70 That is not a good situation to be in and it's going to take a miracle to get out of it.
01:51:42.70 --> 01:51:49.42 And the fact that he's the only guy that was killed is incredible and it's clearly, you know,
01:51:49.42 --> 01:51:58.62 due to his actions. Clearly, I mean, again, you have, the enemy has elevated positions too.
01:51:58.62 --> 01:52:04.78 Yeah, this is on the rooftops and so yeah, I mean it's important.
01:52:04.78 --> 01:52:10.70 And obviously to tell the story and people to know this sacrifice and I mean a lot of people
01:52:10.70 --> 01:52:19.10 listen to this that are active duty in the military and that sort of aggressiveness on the battlefield
01:52:19.10 --> 01:52:24.38 when things are going bad is going to keep people alive. And obviously you've got to be a courageous
01:52:25.58 --> 01:52:31.26 courageous human being to do that. But the alternative, you know, in this case, would have been
01:52:31.26 --> 01:52:40.38 incredibly horrible. I got to several of the guys were there, whether it was the dock when I
01:52:40.38 --> 01:52:47.02 went to see him, but that is to talk about the impact of what Travis did or Lieutenant Morang was
01:52:47.02 --> 01:52:51.82 there and he sent me a message and said, hey, you know, there's no doubt in my mind that Travis
01:52:51.82 --> 01:52:57.90 saved my life in the life of the entire patrol that day. So I mean the guys that were there were
01:52:57.90 --> 01:53:09.66 with them, they know what I'm. How much longer after this did you start writing this book?
01:53:12.94 --> 01:53:20.22 Wow, about five years afterwards, just started to get down to writing it.
01:53:20.22 --> 01:53:28.62 And I, you know, there's a story behind that too, right? I mean, the last time I talked to Travis
01:53:28.62 --> 01:53:36.62 was a week before we lost him. And it was an unusual call because normally I was with my wife and this
01:53:36.62 --> 01:53:42.70 time I wasn't, it was about by myself. And I guess he felt a little bit more open to share with me
01:53:42.70 --> 01:53:49.74 what was going on and he was, you could sense that there was a lot of happening. And he had a message
01:53:49.74 --> 01:53:54.46 for me, kept sharing that he said that it's incredible what I'm seeing over here. It's incredible
01:53:54.46 --> 01:54:00.62 what these young Marines are doing, what I'm seeing every day they're fighting in the streets.
01:54:01.10 --> 01:54:04.62 They're putting it on the line. I don't think the rest of the country knows what's going on.
01:54:05.34 --> 01:54:09.02 And he knew that because he could back to Camp Feluse, the turn on the TV and see what we were
01:54:09.02 --> 01:54:14.38 watching back here. And then he'd be on patrol and just sort of see the incredible things that
01:54:14.38 --> 01:54:21.74 were going on and it was a huge disconnect for him. And he got cut off several times in that phone
01:54:21.74 --> 01:54:29.82 call and he kept calling me back and he'd start all over again. Dad, you really, you really got to
01:54:29.82 --> 01:54:35.50 get the message back to people. It's incredible what's happening here. You know, the American
01:54:35.50 --> 01:54:42.86 people don't know the incredible things these guys are doing. And so I got cut off of them the
01:54:42.86 --> 01:54:48.38 last time. And I always signed off to tell how much the love them and it was the first time
01:54:49.34 --> 01:54:56.30 that I missed them. I figured okay, I'll hear from them next weekend. And we got to knock on the door
01:54:56.30 --> 01:55:03.58 that next weekend that we lost Travis. You know, your worst nightmare, your only son, so proud of them
01:55:04.78 --> 01:55:10.94 and figured okay, most natural thing for us is the roll down the shades, lock the doors and just tell
01:55:10.94 --> 01:55:17.74 everyone to go away. And it was because that last conversation I had with him, we knew there was
01:55:17.74 --> 01:55:23.66 going to be media and sure enough there was. I pulled my wife and daughter together, I said, you know what?
01:55:24.54 --> 01:55:31.66 When they call us, we're going to talk. And really this book is about talking about sharing the
01:55:31.66 --> 01:55:36.46 stories. I've been on that mission since the last time I talked to Travis and he gave me that
01:55:36.46 --> 01:55:42.78 mission to do this. And so I was pretty certain early on that was going to do something. And
01:55:42.78 --> 01:55:48.30 initially I thought, okay, I heard about Travis and his Marines and his Influcian, how they turned
01:55:48.30 --> 01:55:54.94 to Ty. So maybe that would be the story. We could talk about how these brave Marines and
01:55:54.94 --> 01:56:02.06 work together with the Iraqis to make that happen. And then we lost Brendan. You know, when I
01:56:02.06 --> 01:56:07.42 realize, you know, maybe it's not that story. Maybe it's the bigger story of our Navy SEALs and
01:56:07.42 --> 01:56:12.54 our Marines and everyone that's putting on the uniform and the sacrifices they're making.
01:56:13.82 --> 01:56:19.10 And so that's why it sort of took me a little while. I mean, we had with us Travis, you know,
01:56:19.10 --> 01:56:25.34 seven, we lost Brendan in 2010 and I had just come back from doing some of the stuff over in
01:56:25.34 --> 01:56:33.90 Iraq. I started to think, well, maybe it's a different story. And when you do a really, you know,
01:56:35.18 --> 01:56:42.78 an amazing job in the book of talking about how you how your family, how you, you and your family,
01:56:42.78 --> 01:56:51.42 you know, dealt with the loss. And but is there anything that you find? I mean, did you find it
01:56:51.42 --> 01:56:56.54 to be sort of therapeutic to say, look, we have a new mission now. Our mission is to get the
01:56:56.54 --> 01:57:00.86 word out and tell the story and learn as much as we can about it and let other people know what's
01:57:00.86 --> 01:57:08.62 going on? I think it was, it definitely helped, you know, to know that we could do something with
01:57:08.62 --> 01:57:14.78 his loss, you know, get out there. And if we could do something to bridge the gap between
01:57:15.66 --> 01:57:19.50 the country and our military and our guys and men and women serving in uniform,
01:57:19.50 --> 01:57:26.38 you know, it's certainly gave us something to get up every morning and have a reason.
01:57:27.18 --> 01:57:31.90 And when we started thinking about his message, you know, part of that, if not me, then who message?
01:57:31.90 --> 01:57:35.74 That goes back to that last conversation I have with him because when we started telling the
01:57:35.74 --> 01:57:41.10 stories, my son-in-law shared that story with a newspaper and all of a sudden, that if not me,
01:57:41.10 --> 01:57:48.38 then who sort of caught on and people started to say, you know what? I like that. It was five
01:57:48.38 --> 01:57:54.70 simple but really, really powerful words and that's what we use now as our sort of rally
01:57:54.70 --> 01:58:02.54 cry for our foundation. If not me, then who? You went through this, you know, you went through
01:58:02.54 --> 01:58:11.98 your loss of Travis and did you get closer with Brendan after that or did it maintain or?
01:58:11.98 --> 01:58:19.02 Yeah, we got a lot closer with Brendan. I mean, absolutely. Brendan was in seal training when
01:58:19.02 --> 01:58:26.86 we lost Travis and I still remember that call with with my wife. But yeah, he would come and
01:58:26.86 --> 01:58:32.62 in visit us and still remember when he came back and he came right up to our place and
01:58:34.22 --> 01:58:39.42 mostly people felt uncomfortable coming to visit the parents by themselves so they'd come and
01:58:39.42 --> 01:58:44.14 groups. But when Brendan called up, shortly after he got back and I said, okay, will you come
01:58:44.14 --> 01:58:49.50 up with Brendan? He says, I'm coming by myself and we spent the night doing shots of the
01:58:49.50 --> 01:58:54.78 drone and our bar and talking about stories of he and Travis and their friendship.
01:58:54.78 --> 01:59:02.46 Well, another thing was Travis or Brendan had just started buds and you know, he was saying,
01:59:02.46 --> 01:59:06.46 hey, I'm going to come home for the funeral and you and your wife said, no, you do what you
01:59:06.46 --> 01:59:10.78 got to do, you got to get through this training, you know, you can come later. Yeah, which is,
01:59:11.58 --> 01:59:18.22 well, we knew he was just sort of struggling with the loss in a big, big way and he wanted to
01:59:18.22 --> 01:59:26.22 be there and you know, he was sharing that with my wife, real strong and, you know, he knew what
01:59:26.22 --> 01:59:34.22 Travis wanted him to do is to carry on and and so he did that, you know, and he sure did that
01:59:34.22 --> 01:59:42.54 in a big way out there and San Diego. Yeah, and Brendan crushed crushed buds and you don't throw
01:59:42.54 --> 01:59:48.70 that around, bite me. You don't throw around someone crushing buds lately. And one of the things
01:59:48.70 --> 01:59:55.10 one of the quotes that they pulled out in here that he applied during buds was, one of Brendan's
01:59:55.10 --> 02:00:00.62 favorite quotes was one he rarely spoke out loud, but always kept in the back of his mind.
02:00:00.62 --> 02:00:10.22 Be strong, be accountable, never complain. Yeah, that's Brendan. Absolutely. And that attitude
02:00:10.22 --> 02:00:17.02 going in, he ended up being the honor man of his buds class and so the honor man is the guy
02:00:17.02 --> 02:00:24.78 that's basically the best performer in everything. And again, you're going to buds, you got some
02:00:24.78 --> 02:00:32.06 competitive high level athletes in there and to be the honor man, you got to be a bit of a bad
02:00:32.06 --> 02:00:37.82 ass. Yeah. Well, some of the guys who were there with him share with me that it wasn't even close,
02:00:37.82 --> 02:00:45.50 even, you know, I mean, like he was blowing everything away. So he was, he was possessed as they,
02:00:45.50 --> 02:00:51.82 they share with me. That's, that sounds like, that sounds like he was definitely getting after it.
02:00:51.82 --> 02:00:58.94 And, and, and, you know, I, I won't even say I imagine I actually know for a fact that
02:01:00.22 --> 02:01:05.26 losing Travis must have fueled his fire beyond anyone could be probably had, you're right. There
02:01:05.26 --> 02:01:11.98 was no, I was going to compete with that, you know, he knew he had a job to do. And so much so that when
02:01:13.42 --> 02:01:18.86 when he got done and graduated in my wife, Janet and I were at the wedding
02:01:18.86 --> 02:01:26.70 meeting with Amy and Brendan that he called Janet over and gave Janet his Navy seal
02:01:26.70 --> 02:01:33.98 tried and, and, you know, he just did it privately. It was the way Brendan was gave it to her
02:01:34.54 --> 02:01:38.46 and said you know, I couldn't have gotten this without Travis being there with me every step
02:01:38.46 --> 02:01:46.46 of a way. And I want you to have this. And I was at the other end of the room and I still remember
02:01:46.46 --> 02:01:51.90 Janet coming up with tears in her eyes and sharing that story with me. It was just sort of the
02:01:51.90 --> 02:01:55.98 type of guy Brendan was, you know. Yeah, that's just, I mean, that was another thing that
02:01:55.98 --> 02:02:01.26 that, that, in the book you talk about is he got the honor man plaque and, like, he like mailed it to
02:02:01.26 --> 02:02:05.58 his parents. Yeah. And his attitude was, hey, this isn't on me, you know, this is on you. Thanks
02:02:05.58 --> 02:02:10.46 for support over the years. Yeah. And then given the tried to, to your wife, Janet, I mean,
02:02:10.46 --> 02:02:15.66 just a humble humble guy that always gave credit to everyone else and, and your wife gave him
02:02:17.10 --> 02:02:25.90 the black bracelet that said, first lieutenant Travis man in USMC, Spartan hero leader,
02:02:28.06 --> 02:02:39.18 killed an Iraq Iraqi freedom, 29 April of 07. And then this had to be hard for you.
02:02:39.18 --> 02:02:44.46 You can now you're even closer with Brendan, with Brendan, you're even closer with Brendan.
02:02:44.46 --> 02:02:51.02 And he tells you guys at his wedding. So you're there celebrating the wedding and all of a
02:02:51.02 --> 02:02:57.26 sudden he says, I don't know something to tell you. Going to Iraq in 48 hours. Yeah.
02:02:57.26 --> 02:03:01.10 Was, and by the way, he's going to fallusia. Did he tell you guys he was going to fallusia?
02:03:01.10 --> 02:03:06.94 Yeah, he told us where he's headed. You know, hard to believe, you know, he's there,
02:03:06.94 --> 02:03:12.22 celebrating such a great day. And then to find out that his honeymoon's in fluency.
02:03:13.90 --> 02:03:19.90 You know, I think, you know, you hear about, we hear so much about our guys in uniform and
02:03:19.90 --> 02:03:23.90 what they're doing, but just sort of think about those types of sacrifices. You know, we don't
02:03:23.90 --> 02:03:29.58 hear enough of that stuff, you know, what the families are going through and missing those special
02:03:29.58 --> 02:03:36.38 times, you know, it's a big, big impact all the way around. Well, I was trying to remind people
02:03:36.38 --> 02:03:42.62 that the heroes that we talk about, their heroes and their people, their people like everyone else
02:03:42.62 --> 02:03:50.30 with wives and families and they miss their home, they miss their family. They want to be at the
02:03:50.30 --> 02:03:58.46 dance recital and the basketball game and the wrestling match. They're not just these, you know,
02:03:58.46 --> 02:04:03.74 foreign objects that just do nothing to fight man, their people. And I always trying to remind
02:04:03.74 --> 02:04:09.02 everyone of that. And this is a classic example. Here he is, Marion is sweetheart who had met
02:04:09.02 --> 02:04:15.18 at the Naval Academy, spending time with you, spending time with his family and he's leaving for
02:04:15.18 --> 02:04:22.46 Iraq, 48 hours later, honeymoon in fluency. Yeah, big, big sacrifice for these guys.
02:04:23.58 --> 02:04:32.46 And he does that deployment to fluency. And kind of, you know, here's a letter that he wrote home on
02:04:32.46 --> 02:04:37.66 that Miss Manion, it was great to see you guys at the wedding. I'm glad you guys were able to make it
02:04:37.66 --> 02:04:43.66 mental out to both me and Amy to see you both there. I'm doing okay over here. Since since arriving,
02:04:43.66 --> 02:04:47.74 I've been tasked with reviewing all the e-vals. It's evaluation in awards for the command
02:04:48.46 --> 02:04:53.66 as well as work in the Tactical Operations Center. I'm sure you've heard about the decreased violence
02:04:53.66 --> 02:05:00.94 out here and provincial Iraqi control taking place in Alambar to see how much different it is over here
02:05:00.94 --> 02:05:06.62 since last time as a true testament to the work that everyone over here has done. I've not had the
02:05:06.62 --> 02:05:12.86 opportunity to get out to combat outpost Manion on a trip out west to Alassad,
02:05:14.38 --> 02:05:21.10 while myself and Rob Sarver, another US Naval Academy, O4 guy who knew Travis, we're waiting
02:05:21.10 --> 02:05:25.82 for our he-load of show up. We struck up a conversation with a young Lance Corporal. This young
02:05:25.82 --> 02:05:31.50 Marine was a mid-team member and had mentioned that he'd just come from cop Manion. When we heard
02:05:31.50 --> 02:05:35.74 that, I let him know that Travis was a good friend of mine in a college and a roommate during
02:05:35.74 --> 02:05:42.06 college. He said that he did not know him, but he'd heard great things about Travis. He also said
02:05:42.06 --> 02:05:47.82 that there was a room at the cop dedicated to him with pictures. I just thought you would like that
02:05:47.82 --> 02:05:53.02 story since Travis is still influencing the men and women over here. Love Brendan.
02:05:53.02 --> 02:05:59.98 Yeah, he eventually made it out there. Rob shared with me. Oh, he made it out to cop Manion.
02:05:59.98 --> 02:06:03.82 Was the cop Manion in Fludja? It was Northearch. It was Northearch.
02:06:03.82 --> 02:06:07.82 If you've ever been through karma, I didn't go through karma.
02:06:07.82 --> 02:06:13.10 Yeah, so karma is when I was over there, they flew me out to Camp Fludja and then
02:06:14.06 --> 02:06:19.50 karma's not too far away from Camp Fludja and it's a little Northearch of karma. So the
02:06:19.50 --> 02:06:27.34 Iraqis said that one of the name of the outpost after Travis, which was again for their
02:06:27.34 --> 02:06:38.94 recognition of what he put on the line for them. Awesome. But you could see from that note that
02:06:40.22 --> 02:06:46.86 what Brendan was facing in Fludja at that time, even over what a bit of a six-month period
02:06:46.86 --> 02:06:51.66 or something maybe longer than that, but it was completely mellow compared to what Travis was
02:06:51.66 --> 02:06:58.70 in Durn. We were just way ahead at that time. Yeah, it changed dramatically at that point for sure.
02:06:58.70 --> 02:07:06.22 And so Brendan had a fairly mellow deployment comes home and then goes back on deployment.
02:07:06.22 --> 02:07:10.70 Again, like you just said, new wife, you just went on deployment, doesn't matter. We're sending
02:07:10.70 --> 02:07:14.94 you back on deployment. That's the way it works. Two, three, four deployments? Yep.
02:07:14.94 --> 02:07:20.30 Yeah. So now we're talking, he goes back this time and goes to Afghanistan.
02:07:22.62 --> 02:07:27.58 You know, just a little bit about Brendan's leadership with a Taliban launching. It's annual
02:07:27.58 --> 02:07:32.54 spring offensive. Brendan and his platoon started to see more action in May. Just as he had
02:07:32.54 --> 02:07:39.02 predicted in his email to Tom and Janet surrounded by jagged cliffs, extreme poverty and acute
02:07:39.02 --> 02:07:43.58 desolation, which many of the younger seals had never experienced. It was Brendan's responsibility
02:07:43.58 --> 02:07:49.02 to keep them optimistic, focused and sharp considering that the seals were sleeping on a
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:53.90 fob in the middle of nowhere, thousands of miles away from home, setting a positive tone was never
02:07:53.90 --> 02:08:01.10 an easy task. Rather than barking out orders to the seals under his command, Brendan was loom dog.
02:08:01.10 --> 02:08:08.46 They enlisted seals as they loved working for the 29 year old lieutenant because even though
02:08:08.46 --> 02:08:12.94 Brendan was an officer, he still fought of himself as one of the boys. So, you know, you see a very
02:08:12.94 --> 02:08:19.66 similar type of attitude. Yeah, his guys, you know, having a chance to talk to them, they, you know,
02:08:19.66 --> 02:08:26.54 everybody loved Brendan. And he was just a great, great leader, right? Yeah. No doubt. Like I said,
02:08:26.54 --> 02:08:32.78 the biggest thing I remember about him, you know, was no matter what I was saying to him, not not an
02:08:32.78 --> 02:08:38.86 attitude, but just like a positive attitude. I'll say that. Yeah. He's getting towards the end of
02:08:38.86 --> 02:08:46.86 that deployment, like right towards the end of that deployment. And goes back and forth,
02:08:47.66 --> 02:08:55.10 emails with Amy on Monday, Amy and Brendan exchanged emails, six months that Amy dreaded
02:08:55.98 --> 02:08:59.82 were coming to a close and finally they would be living together again as husband and wife.
02:09:00.46 --> 02:09:04.78 Brendan could barely contain himself during his last reply before his last mission.
02:09:04.78 --> 02:09:10.14 Can't wait to get home and go on a long overdue vacation with you. I call you when I get back
02:09:10.14 --> 02:09:22.38 from my office. Love you, Missia. Me. So, they were allowed on this operation. Brendan
02:09:22.38 --> 02:09:28.38 assignment in support of Operation C. Serpent and ongoing joint anti-terror assault was to watch over
02:09:28.38 --> 02:09:36.38 the village of Ayatala in the mountains in southeastern Afghanistan province of Zabul.
02:09:37.74 --> 02:09:43.18 As on other tactical Overwatch missions on this one, Brendan and his team would serve as guardian
02:09:43.18 --> 02:09:49.58 angels, much like when Travis held the roof during after a chlorine attack in Follugia.
02:09:50.38 --> 02:09:54.30 No matter what transpired in the darkness below, Brendan and his seals equipped with
02:09:54.30 --> 02:10:00.38 night vision equipment would be watching. Quiet and focused, we tend to Brendan Looney flew
02:10:00.38 --> 02:10:05.34 above the skies of Afghanistan on the 59th combat mission of his fourth overseas deployment.
02:10:06.70 --> 02:10:10.38 As bright moonlight shined into the chopper through the war zone, soaring mountains,
02:10:11.02 --> 02:10:20.70 the words Spartan, Hero, Leader reflected from the bracelet, Brendan always wore on his right
02:10:20.70 --> 02:10:27.42 wrist. Moments from landing on top of a mountain, the seals and soldiers aboard the chopper
02:10:27.42 --> 02:10:33.66 on hook their safety belts and prepared to dismount. Suddenly a terrible piercing sound
02:10:33.66 --> 02:10:39.02 stunned everyone aboard the helicopter which rapidly tumbled down a jagged steep cliff
02:10:39.02 --> 02:10:46.14 before plunging into the darkness. The frantic moments then ensued were harrowing, dreadful,
02:10:46.14 --> 02:10:56.30 and tragic. So that's Brendan's just think about it. His 59th combat mission
02:10:57.18 --> 02:11:04.22 and he's two weeks from coming home and the new group comes in and who's the one guy that says,
02:11:04.22 --> 02:11:08.78 you know what I'll go with the new guys and show him around. We've been out here the whole time.
02:11:09.82 --> 02:11:13.74 I don't want them going out there without anyone and that's Brendan Looney.
02:11:13.74 --> 02:11:21.50 Yeah. And he jumps in and held a cop to win down and only once survived.
02:11:22.22 --> 02:11:28.14 Yeah, it's a turnover operation as what we call it. That's when you're taking the new guys as you
02:11:28.14 --> 02:11:33.42 said, I think these guys were from team four, taking them out, you know, you're just one guy
02:11:33.42 --> 02:11:37.10 that's hey we've done this before. We'll just do a turnover and make sure you guys know what's
02:11:37.10 --> 02:11:44.94 happening and give any advice we can. And like you said, you're ready to go home. Yeah. And
02:11:46.70 --> 02:11:51.90 somebody's got to step up and do that. And like you said, who's going to do it? Well,
02:11:52.78 --> 02:12:00.86 Brendan's going to do it. Yeah. And you know after Brendan was killed and you guys,
02:12:00.86 --> 02:12:08.94 you know, Amy had said she wanted Brendan to be buried next to Travis.
02:12:10.70 --> 02:12:16.86 Yeah, you know, you, yes, you know, wonder why things happen the way they do. But we never had
02:12:16.86 --> 02:12:23.66 that talk with Travis like what happens if you don't come back. And when we lost him, my wife and I were
02:12:23.66 --> 02:12:29.74 like, well, we should have him near us here at home. So we've buried him close by us and outside of
02:12:29.74 --> 02:12:34.86 Philadelphia. And then shortly after that, we heard from some family and friends that, hey,
02:12:34.86 --> 02:12:38.86 they had a serious conversation with Travis and he said he wanted to be in Arlington if anything.
02:12:38.86 --> 02:12:45.02 I'm told. So I called down the Arlington. They said, yeah, we can we've re-interred, we can do that.
02:12:45.42 --> 02:12:51.90 Just let us know if you want that to happen and we'll make an happen. So we never got
02:12:51.90 --> 02:12:59.50 Travis situated and never had a headstone, had a wooden cross there and we kept talking about it.
02:12:59.50 --> 02:13:05.26 You know, and it's almost three years later and my wife was the one that was most reluctant
02:13:05.26 --> 02:13:10.54 because she was visiting Travis every day and she just couldn't come to grips with making that decision.
02:13:11.98 --> 02:13:16.30 And then we get to call the first person that did Brendan's mom called was my wife,
02:13:16.30 --> 02:13:23.58 Janet, when she got the news and we were just devastated. And we got down there and Amy came
02:13:23.58 --> 02:13:29.98 in the town and she said, you know, I want I went Brendan next to Travis and Arlington.
02:13:29.98 --> 02:13:34.62 Now she knew she was at Travis's service. She knew Travis wasn't in Arlington but maybe she
02:13:34.62 --> 02:13:38.70 had forgotten in the shock. And I know how that goes. You're just in total shock.
02:13:38.70 --> 02:13:46.30 And at that point I could just see it in my wife's eyes. She said this is it. This is
02:13:46.30 --> 02:13:51.34 now we need to do this. She was ready to do it. And they moved mountains to make it happen.
02:13:51.34 --> 02:13:59.50 I mean they departmented the army and Arlington moved, helped us move Travis down there in two
02:13:59.50 --> 02:14:05.02 weeks and then we laid Brendan that following Monday.
02:14:05.02 --> 02:14:11.10 We're just, originally said let's do this the same day. And I was like well no this is
02:14:11.10 --> 02:14:16.78 Brendan's day. We're just like a quiet ceremony. So we did it the Friday before and this quiet
02:14:16.78 --> 02:14:26.30 ceremony. We had, we had all the Marines from, from Manion Hall down at where the officer school was
02:14:26.30 --> 02:14:31.98 they have a hall named after Travis. They all showed up and of course the loonies you think about
02:14:31.98 --> 02:14:36.78 our service members but the strength of the families they insisted with all that we're going
02:14:36.78 --> 02:14:42.38 through that they were going to be over there and they were there with us. So we laid Travis down
02:14:42.38 --> 02:14:49.26 on that Friday and then Brendan the following Monday and Secretary Gates was there and all his
02:14:49.90 --> 02:14:57.66 Navy seals were there to pay him respects and they put their tridents in his, you know, his
02:14:57.66 --> 02:15:05.50 coffin and it was a real emotional time obviously you know just like such a such a tough time.
02:15:09.18 --> 02:15:17.74 I'm going to close out the book here with the words that you spoke on the day that you
02:15:17.74 --> 02:15:28.22 in turn Travis Adderlington. I want to thank the looney family for their presence here today.
02:15:29.82 --> 02:15:37.90 Our hearts go out to you as you deal with us incredible loss. Brendan represents the best
02:15:37.90 --> 02:15:48.78 this country has to offer. We mourn him now and we will forever the passing of this American hero.
02:15:51.82 --> 02:15:56.94 There are so many mixed emotions for us as we move Travis to this place of honor.
02:15:59.34 --> 02:16:05.58 Brendan's loss fills all our waking hours yet we're moving Travis to be next to his great friend
02:16:05.58 --> 02:16:14.62 and together with all their warrior brothers and sisters who've paid their full measure
02:16:15.50 --> 02:16:24.06 defending freedom. This solemn place leaves us with a sadness for the sacrifices but also
02:16:24.06 --> 02:16:31.10 extremely proud of these brave Americans who so unselfishly and courageously step forward to
02:16:31.10 --> 02:16:40.94 confront the evil that faces our world. We the families of these defenders of freedom can't
02:16:40.94 --> 02:16:48.94 begin to describe the void that fills our hearts but we can tell you how much our sons and daughters
02:16:48.94 --> 02:16:56.06 love this country and all that it stands for. We are now their voice.
02:16:56.06 --> 02:17:09.10 So Travis as we lay you here today beside your brother Brendan and with all your fellow patriots
02:17:10.62 --> 02:17:19.34 we will always remember the selfless service and sacrifice and we will continue to rally in
02:17:19.34 --> 02:17:29.82 your honor with the call if not me then who to make a difference for others and to always
02:17:29.82 --> 02:17:41.02 step forward to do what's right no matter what the cost. God bless you my son and
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:51.90 rest in peace with your warrior brothers and sisters. First lieutenant Travis Manion United States Marine
02:17:51.90 --> 02:18:10.62 Corps Lieutenant Brendan Looney United States Navy Warriors for freedom brothers forever.
02:18:12.86 --> 02:18:17.58 Yes so when you think about section 60 and all the loss there and
02:18:17.58 --> 02:18:27.34 you know symbolically there Brendan and Travis great friends and there side by side and
02:18:27.34 --> 02:18:31.98 armington if you're ever there you know when I'm out talking to people I say you know if you don't
02:18:31.98 --> 02:18:37.98 if you haven't taken your family the armington put it on the list you're in DC or make a special trip to DC
02:18:39.02 --> 02:18:45.90 to go see armington and teach your family about that sacrifice and make sure you go to section 60 where
02:18:45.90 --> 02:18:52.46 all those heroes of today have I reckon Afghanistan or there's always something that's happening
02:18:52.46 --> 02:19:03.34 in section 60 and after that September when we moved Travis in that following spring the Navy
02:19:03.34 --> 02:19:09.26 seals found and killed those some have been ladden and then a couple weeks later the
02:19:09.26 --> 02:19:14.86 president spoke about Travis and Brendan as an example for the country in Arlington and his
02:19:14.86 --> 02:19:22.70 memorial deadress we were down there with the loonies to hear that but again their their story is a
02:19:22.70 --> 02:19:30.46 story that could be anybody story there's so many in uniform that do so much and for me writing this
02:19:30.46 --> 02:19:36.46 book is is telling their story but making sure it's part of that bigger story and the people
02:19:36.46 --> 02:19:41.34 appreciate arm men when I mean uniform and all they are and what they stand for.
02:19:41.34 --> 02:19:52.38 Well it's an amazing story and Travis is still doing good right now with his name and you
02:19:52.38 --> 02:19:57.10 guys started the Travis Canyon foundation tell us a little bit about that.
02:19:58.86 --> 02:20:05.42 Well you know as I shared earlier you know we wanted to make sure we made an impact and we got the
02:20:05.42 --> 02:20:10.30 word out and and part of that was my wife said you know I'm going to start a foundation and I
02:20:10.30 --> 02:20:16.38 wanted to be there for our veterans make sure I'm supporting the families of the fallen and the last
02:20:16.38 --> 02:20:22.22 part of it was was making sure that we do something to support that next generation of leaders.
02:20:23.10 --> 02:20:28.70 So she started a character program character does matter where we get veterans in front of young
02:20:28.70 --> 02:20:38.06 kids and talk about character and service and integrity and leadership and you know my wife started
02:20:38.06 --> 02:20:42.30 that we we had good friends that were there when we lost Travis they said you know what you
02:20:42.30 --> 02:20:49.90 guys should set up a memorial fund and a little flowers and we did that and before we knew it when
02:20:49.90 --> 02:20:55.34 we turned around and looked at the bank account we had money coming in from all over the country and we
02:20:55.34 --> 02:21:03.18 had $200,000 my wife had $200,000 and she had those five words from Travis if not me than who
02:21:03.18 --> 02:21:10.22 and she got going with that with those two things and she came in every day first started right
02:21:10.22 --> 02:21:17.10 in our kitchen and started working it and you know she worked it to when we lost her most
02:21:17.10 --> 02:21:23.58 Janet five years almost five years to the day after Travis we lost my wife to cancer and I
02:21:23.58 --> 02:21:28.14 guess you know you think about that that sacrifice and the impact on the families and
02:21:28.14 --> 02:21:33.82 I remember doing some research after we found out she had cancer and said as she had a significant
02:21:33.82 --> 02:21:40.70 stressful event in the last four to five years yeah you know she lost her son and we think about
02:21:40.70 --> 02:21:47.26 that and then you think about Brendan's mom who recently died of cancer or JP Blacks Miss
02:21:47.26 --> 02:21:54.46 Mom who died of cancer you know so the impact is significant across the board for our families
02:21:54.46 --> 02:22:01.66 and our our guys and gals and uniform so we got going on that and in my daughter's picked it up
02:22:01.66 --> 02:22:07.34 since and she's doing a great job with it she's working with a lot of a lot of great young people
02:22:07.34 --> 02:22:13.90 Amy Looney's another one of the leaders of the foundation and she heads up operations in Washington
02:22:13.90 --> 02:22:20.38 DC we've got an office here in San Diego we've got one we just opened up in Atlanta we're outside
02:22:20.38 --> 02:22:24.78 of Philadelphia Washington we're getting ready to open up an office in Chicago and we've got an
02:22:24.78 --> 02:22:30.38 office in Houston Texas and we're working with our veterans and helping them through transition
02:22:30.38 --> 02:22:35.82 we're working with the families and you know you asked before is this was this somewhat
02:22:36.94 --> 02:22:43.10 telling this story a little bit therapeutic and you know doing this foundation and pushing that
02:22:43.10 --> 02:22:48.78 forward was that therapeutic and you know we really believe it is you know and we believe you know
02:22:48.78 --> 02:22:55.18 there's a grieving period but we know that Travis would not want us to keep grieving
02:22:55.90 --> 02:23:01.58 it wants us to say hey let's go you know pick it up and get out there and and do something
02:23:02.14 --> 02:23:07.58 and make a difference and so we do that you know that's what we do every day and we give some of the
02:23:07.58 --> 02:23:13.42 families chance to do that too we get families to go out and go on expeditions and help
02:23:13.42 --> 02:23:20.94 those that are in need build houses and it's really great for them you know it's great to see them
02:23:20.94 --> 02:23:26.06 out there doing something in honor of the lost one loved one and making an impact for others
02:23:26.06 --> 02:23:32.22 what's the best way for people to support where can they find out information about the Travis

02:29:52.30 --> 02:29:57.82 I just think as I didn't technically didn't take them off is when we switch platforms they just failed to
02:29:59.10 --> 02:30:05.66 translate so it was the platform's fault not yours yeah nope no extreme disjoinership on that one
02:30:05.66 --> 02:30:11.02 and you know I blame tech on that you know joc go away too over there dig it oh we're gonna get
02:30:11.02 --> 02:30:16.54 yeah that's on the on that joclostore dot com yeah you can get the joc away te on there
02:30:16.54 --> 02:30:24.94 through there um if you like t-shirts those are on there discipline equals freedom
02:30:26.22 --> 02:30:34.06 the reason I think that that's a good shirt my opinion is because of course the layers I get it
02:30:34.06 --> 02:30:39.50 but it is one of those simple little things like it's not and it's not like too extreme either it's not like
02:30:41.10 --> 02:30:47.10 echo when we designed the shirt echo wanted to put a flying tank with dragon fire coming out of
02:30:47.10 --> 02:30:54.22 its mouth yeah and a skull yeah so let's put all over the whole face all over yeah see and I
02:30:54.22 --> 02:31:02.30 feel like too much yeah yeah so or you know like it I was the same like all eat your kids for breakfast
02:31:02.30 --> 02:31:07.10 if you mess with me you know those times the crazy sayings that will only hit maybe like one out of
02:31:07.10 --> 02:31:11.10 a hundred times you know when someone reads it it's not that really cannibal's a pair of
02:31:13.10 --> 02:31:20.54 you know not many of them last right I don't think so but this one equals it it's it's
02:31:21.74 --> 02:31:27.82 for lack of a better term understated yet powerful that's my opinion anyway other shirts on there
02:31:27.82 --> 02:31:34.54 you know various messages and with those messages come layers and what that means is
02:31:35.42 --> 02:31:39.58 you can look at it and be like okay that's a cool shirt but there's more to it so if you listen to
02:31:39.58 --> 02:31:45.10 this podcast for listening to jocca you'll be like oh I get it I mean yeah okay there's more than just
02:31:45.10 --> 02:31:50.14 what's on the surface there's another layer to say yeah that's exactly right if you listen you know
02:31:50.14 --> 02:31:57.34 some rashcards on there new rashcards gonna come out in less than one week also
02:31:58.86 --> 02:32:04.70 good way to support this podcast very good way to support yourself in your journey
02:32:06.14 --> 02:32:11.90 journey or we do do people still use word journey to your word man go with it I never felt comfortable
02:32:11.90 --> 02:32:18.78 using the word journey it's you weren't going anywhere right I don't think I'm gonna have an actual
02:32:18.78 --> 02:32:24.86 journey but you know it's one of those things that you kind of hear people saying it kind of sounds epic
02:32:24.86 --> 02:32:29.58 but then when you say it it sounds real stupid I felt like the word journey is kind of like
02:32:29.58 --> 02:32:37.34 anyway yeah all right if you're on your journey to what get up early be more discipline get a better
02:32:37.34 --> 02:32:43.26 diet just get your health together get your whole thing together this is what will help you there
02:32:43.26 --> 02:32:49.90 okay so on this journey it's not gonna be you're not gonna be hitting every day like killing
02:32:49.90 --> 02:32:55.34 every day you're gonna have some days gonna be harder than others so if you're having trouble for
02:32:55.34 --> 02:33:03.10 example waking up early one day this is what you're gonna do you're gonna search psychological warfare
02:33:03.10 --> 02:33:09.90 jocco welling on iTunes or Amazon music okay so it's this album with tracks and you put on your
02:33:09.90 --> 02:33:16.14 phone whatever you listen to the track that's gonna help you get out of bed that one's called wake up
02:33:17.42 --> 02:33:24.54 wake up wake up and get after it boom so instead of instead of hitting the snooze you hit
02:33:25.10 --> 02:33:29.50 or put it as your ringtone clear it with your wife or whoever you sleep with but put it as your ringtone
02:33:30.94 --> 02:33:35.90 it's jockel's voice he'll tell you why you should wake up and get after it and you that's
02:33:35.90 --> 02:33:41.74 convincing it is you'd be so I mean wait who's there was like one we've had a year
02:33:41.74 --> 02:33:47.98 I don't want 100% success rate there's one guy because there's actually three tracks to wake up
02:33:47.98 --> 02:33:52.78 the first one to wake up the second time what did you just do you didn't get out of bed there's one guy
02:33:53.50 --> 02:33:57.74 out of a lot of people that have has made it to the second track everyone else's first track we're
02:33:57.74 --> 02:34:05.58 yeah yeah you can't you can't not get up and again that's a rare case you know that guy he
02:34:05.58 --> 02:34:11.10 probably had a really hard night the night before looking into or looking forward to really really
02:34:11.10 --> 02:34:16.70 hard day and that's why he was considering training wheels right yeah in a way all's at a
02:34:16.70 --> 02:34:23.34 spa spot like you like spot yeah it's better yeah training wheels kind of seems like without it you
02:34:23.34 --> 02:34:28.14 fall down you know this is just for you know if I'm trying to get that max on bench this is a
02:34:28.14 --> 02:34:32.94 this is a big goal I got now on a wake up for one year I'm gonna wake up earlier something like
02:34:32.94 --> 02:34:38.86 it's just like if I have a huge goal with a bench all I'm gonna get it I'll probably get it
02:34:38.86 --> 02:34:43.50 but in the small case that let's say I'm not strong enough today I need to sleep with it
02:34:43.50 --> 02:34:48.94 right I got to spot their boom yeah don't get it same good same exact thing so yeah there it is
02:34:48.94 --> 02:34:54.06 psychological warfare and this goes for for waking up early uh skipping workouts that's a big one
02:34:54.06 --> 02:34:58.62 in my opinion skipping workouts but that's just in my experience so many asked me on time here today
02:34:58.62 --> 02:35:06.54 what was it what what do you say to yourself when you get tired and you want to quit you don't want
02:35:06.54 --> 02:35:09.98 to do anything anymore and I said I don't say anything to myself I just keep doing it
02:35:11.58 --> 02:35:17.66 next question see what that is that's that manual set you know if you're on auto you're like
02:35:17.66 --> 02:35:21.26 what are I feel like if you like not doing if I feel like I want to quit but you're just going to
02:35:21.26 --> 02:35:28.22 sort of quit automatically no no no no no no yeah take control yeah exactly right so yeah
02:35:28.22 --> 02:35:34.06 boom there's a good psychological warfare joccal will link it's good for waking up early if you
02:35:34.06 --> 02:35:37.90 have a day that you don't want to wake up earth you're gonna slip on your diet it's face it we

02:41:47.26 --> 02:41:55.42 that if not me then who motto thanks absolutely honest or and you know sir one more thing before
02:41:55.90 --> 02:42:00.62 we close out I know you you you you were talking about a letter that you had that kind of
02:42:00.62 --> 02:42:09.34 talked about some of the leadership principles that we really learn in the military and really
02:42:09.34 --> 02:42:15.42 make military leaders excel and it's a letter that you got from one of the Marines that that
02:42:15.42 --> 02:42:21.50 worked for your son yeah you know it's sort of interesting that I you know here I am coming
02:42:21.50 --> 02:42:27.90 out to talk to you and I've had the book published for a couple years now but I just I just got this letter
02:42:29.50 --> 02:42:35.42 through coach Garrett you talked about coach Garrett and now this this Marine that was with my
02:42:35.42 --> 02:42:40.86 son sir with my son hooked up with coach Garrett had one of the wrestling events and said hey
02:42:40.86 --> 02:42:51.10 you know Colonel Man you give him this letter and you know here he is checking in after 10 years
02:42:52.38 --> 02:43:01.50 and he says things he'd like to share with me a couple things things they're not well known by
02:43:01.50 --> 02:43:06.78 people other than those and my myself that served with Travis in Follugia those memories of
02:43:06.78 --> 02:43:13.18 things I'm able to hold on to but have been wanting to share with his family as well I apologize for
02:43:13.18 --> 02:43:21.02 such a long silence it seems to be the best opportunity for me to share them with you by passing
02:43:21.02 --> 02:43:27.74 along this letter any hey actually passed along the bracelet he had Travis's name on the bracelet
02:43:27.74 --> 02:43:32.14 he'd worn for the past 10 years especially as he says with 10 year anniversary coming up
02:43:32.14 --> 02:43:40.86 hey talked about you know the backstory is from Columbus Ohio he joined Lima Company
02:43:41.90 --> 02:43:47.26 then meant Travis and the rest of the Marines in January 2007 as they rotated in to work with
02:43:47.26 --> 02:43:55.42 the Iraqi Army counterparts at the time I hit my two-year mark in the core but it not yet
02:43:55.42 --> 02:44:02.30 have an opportunity to work with a true leader with so many with so few Marines assigned to the
02:44:02.30 --> 02:44:07.74 mid team Travis's my team leader Travis was a true leader and someone that was easy for me to look
02:44:07.74 --> 02:44:13.10 up to and respect he had the perfect balance of caring for his Marines without babying them
02:44:13.90 --> 02:44:19.66 discipline without being too harsh being laid back we're not involved in missions
02:44:19.66 --> 02:44:25.90 while standing while still leading from the front once it got time to get to work done and we talked
02:44:25.90 --> 02:44:34.62 about that as I progressed through my military career Travis was a leader that strived to be
02:44:35.74 --> 02:44:42.06 your son said the example of how a leader should be I read the book and enjoyed learning
02:44:42.06 --> 02:44:46.70 more about him as a man not just the Marine I also enjoyed getting to know Brendan
02:44:46.70 --> 02:44:52.94 and they're incredibly rare friendship it made it easy for me to connect how he was as a person
02:44:52.94 --> 02:44:59.82 back home and how he was raised so he said I wanted to share two stories so I hit the highlights of this
02:44:59.82 --> 02:45:07.58 but first story he found Connie humorous and he talked about Travis having to sense humor so
02:45:07.58 --> 02:45:14.62 here you go it's February they're out the patrol turn out to be un-eventsful for the most part
02:45:14.62 --> 02:45:23.02 until they started return to the alpose as they were returning an idea it was initiated and
02:45:23.02 --> 02:45:29.34 ambush started thankfully the idea did not detonate the artillery show it was attached to
02:45:29.74 --> 02:45:35.34 but only the blasting cap and nose of the shell blue this injured his soldier
02:45:37.58 --> 02:45:41.50 and another Iraqi soldier was shot while rushing to the aid
02:45:41.50 --> 02:45:48.78 both were non life threatening once the ambush started I began to radio and back to request QFR
02:45:49.34 --> 02:45:55.42 although Travis was not on the patrol he managed to find a way to get on the QFR to QRF team
02:45:56.30 --> 02:46:03.90 as a short ambush subsided the QRF showed up Travis's presence comma any nerves that I had
02:46:03.90 --> 02:46:11.66 the injured Iraqi had already taken back to receive treatment would I remember most about the situation
02:46:11.66 --> 02:46:17.18 was that Travis always about Travis that brings a smile on my face I was standing on the north side
02:46:17.18 --> 02:46:22.86 of the road and Travis was on the south I remember he began to cross the road in a jog just as an
02:46:22.86 --> 02:46:28.38 Iraqi soldier let about a burst of his AK to the east to stop a vehicle from approaching
02:46:28.38 --> 02:46:35.18 as soon as the burst went off Travis trip across the road doing a barrel roll and coming back to his feet
02:46:35.18 --> 02:46:40.62 with his helmet push back on his head as soon as he reached me on the north side of the road he said
02:46:40.62 --> 02:46:47.02 is everybody okay over here I replied yes sir everyone is okay are you okay sir
02:46:47.82 --> 02:46:51.74 to which he responded yeah but somebody should get that pod hole fix
02:46:51.74 --> 02:46:59.18 and a near death experience for me this part of a laughter as my leader had just
02:46:59.18 --> 02:47:03.66 stopped been startled by an Iraqi army warning shot causing the fall and barrel roll in the middle
02:47:03.66 --> 02:47:09.34 of Iraq history so having that sense of humor right they were left at yourself and then the other
02:47:09.34 --> 02:47:15.82 story shared is is about this guy's birthday my second story of Travis is more sentimental
02:47:15.82 --> 02:47:23.26 my birthday is April 3rd and turning 21 that night we all slated we're slated for overnight
02:47:23.26 --> 02:47:28.62 observation searching for posby dees but I've been pulled from the mission to remain behind
02:47:28.62 --> 02:47:35.18 I thought nothing of it went to bed on the second ready to be on the QQRF in case anything
02:47:35.18 --> 02:47:41.34 were to happen admit night I was woken up and told I needed to go to the COC because they were
02:47:41.34 --> 02:47:46.94 requesting me over the radio I shook the cobwebs from my head and walked to the COC after
02:47:46.94 --> 02:47:51.98 calling to the patrol on the radio I was greeted with Travis Travis's voice in a whisper
02:47:51.98 --> 02:47:57.50 simply to wish me a happy birthday throughout the madness of the trolling stand week all night
02:47:57.50 --> 02:48:02.86 and searching for IDs he had kept me in mind and as soon as the day transition from the second
02:48:02.86 --> 02:48:08.14 to the third he called over the radio to wish me a happy birthday a week later I left Iraq
02:48:08.14 --> 02:48:15.10 the mid team and Travis I will never forget that I'll never forget him yeah so
02:48:16.30 --> 02:48:21.98 you know I just received this the other day and you know still hear from guys that he served with
02:48:21.98 --> 02:48:27.02 and just little things that you know caring about your people having a good sense of humor
02:48:28.86 --> 02:48:32.14 leadership traits that we can all use
02:48:32.14 --> 02:48:41.58 crazy hell these themes they just they're coming you hear everywhere as far as good leaders you
02:48:41.58 --> 02:48:46.14 know like all the good leaders they have these themes that dichotomy like you got to be strict
02:48:46.14 --> 02:48:51.18 but you can't be like a slave driver you know it's that balancing act I guess that's why
02:48:51.18 --> 02:48:56.22 there's just a few leaders because it's so hard to do you know it's like some people think
02:48:56.22 --> 02:49:00.70 I'm just gonna go I'm an extreme guy you know I'm gonna go extreme but it's not like that
02:49:00.70 --> 02:49:06.14 even a guy with an extreme personality like Travis who can push himself that hard to be a
02:49:06.14 --> 02:49:12.14 national level wrestler understands leadership to a point where he knows what it means to call back
02:49:12.14 --> 02:49:18.78 to base while you're out on patrol and wish a happy birthday to one of your men yeah yeah
02:49:18.78 --> 02:49:23.50 it's just awesome it's a good way to put it to echo it's a it's a balancing act you know for
02:49:23.50 --> 02:49:31.98 for everyone it's sort of figured out you know it's not one one situation for everyone you know
02:49:31.58 --> 02:49:39.34 well sir thanks again for for coming on the show and ensuring this story
02:49:40.86 --> 02:49:47.02 thank you for your service in the Marine Corps and of course thank you for raising such
02:49:47.02 --> 02:50:06.30 an incredible man and marine and hero and son and once again we see another another
02:50:06.30 --> 02:50:18.14 another tale another legend of bravery and of sacrifice from these two heroic leaders
02:50:20.06 --> 02:50:24.62 but I still want to remind everyone as always that these are not
02:50:24.62 --> 02:50:35.66 imagined legends or myths then these aren't symbolic stories that were made up
02:50:37.26 --> 02:50:46.54 to reinforce some ancient parable these are the lives of men
02:50:46.54 --> 02:51:07.34 real men who stepped up and stepped forward and gave everything for us and in that sacrifice
02:51:07.34 --> 02:51:19.02 we see the unmeasurable suffering of the families rock with pain and yet filled with pride
02:51:23.42 --> 02:51:37.10 to have known and to have absorbed the light and the love that these men emanated
02:51:37.10 --> 02:51:50.38 in life a light that will not fade and will not grow old like the flesh
02:51:50.38 --> 02:52:06.54 a light that will guide us all down the righteous path toward the good regardless of the cost
02:52:06.54 --> 02:52:21.82 for them we hold our heads higher and do our best to make the world a better place
02:52:24.78 --> 02:52:25.42 like they did
02:52:25.42 --> 02:52:41.02 we will do our utmost to emulate Brendan Looney we will be strong we will be accountable
02:52:41.02 --> 02:52:52.94 we will not complain and in the most trying of times we will ask ourselves a simple question
02:52:52.94 --> 02:53:05.42 the same one the Travis manion asked when he faced the darkness of the world
02:53:05.42 --> 02:53:18.86 if not me then who
02:53:18.86 --> 02:53:32.70 can
02:53:32.70 --> 02:53:34.70 out.
