00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.60
This is Jocko podcast number 348 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:03.60 --> 00:00:05.60
Jocko willing. Good evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:06.96 --> 00:00:12.32
We are turning our society upside down. One Kamirooge officer told a newsweek reporter in

4
00:00:12.32 --> 00:00:20.16
the weeks after the revolution. The people of Panam pen will grow rice, he said, and almost as

5
00:00:20.16 --> 00:00:30.64
an afterthought added they will work or starve. By early May 1975, the Kamirooge were implementing

6
00:00:30.64 --> 00:00:36.40
one of the most radical political plans of the 20th century, a peasant revolution with a punitive

7
00:00:36.40 --> 00:00:42.40
edge. Buddhist monks were made to plow fields. Pagodas were turned into killing centers.

8
00:00:42.40 --> 00:00:49.52
Cham Muslims, a religious minority, were force fed pork. Cambodia's national library was converted

9
00:00:49.52 --> 00:00:57.36
into a pigsty. In Pol Pot's democratic Campuchia, books were used to start fires.

10
00:00:58.56 --> 00:01:06.48
It was more about revenge, recalled one Cambodian. All private property, even money, was abolished

11
00:01:06.48 --> 00:01:15.20
in this ultra great leap forward. The early accounts of life under the Kamirooge came from

12
00:01:15.20 --> 00:01:20.64
Cambodian refugees who escaped to Thailand. At first they sounded too bizarre to be true,

13
00:01:20.64 --> 00:01:27.04
as if George Orwell had written them to satirize life under a dictatorship of the proletariat,

14
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:32.08
a place where parents feared their children and civilians were slaughtered in numbers and for

15
00:01:32.08 --> 00:01:39.92
reasons unimagined since Stalin's purges or Hitler's Third Reich. Survivors described a system of

16
00:01:39.92 --> 00:01:47.12
slave labor, communes where men, women, and children toiled like human water buffalo under the

17
00:01:47.12 --> 00:01:55.92
watchful eye of the mysterious and all-powerful leadership cabal known only as Angar. They

18
00:01:55.92 --> 00:02:05.92
lived in perpetual fear. The CIA held little hope for America's former allies and educated

19
00:02:05.92 --> 00:02:13.28
Cambodians. Quote, executions are reported widespread and in many cases members of the entire

20
00:02:13.28 --> 00:02:18.80
family of former government officials or soldiers are executed along with the heads of the family.

21
00:02:19.68 --> 00:02:26.32
Almost all executions occur in the same manner. Several communist cadres beat the person to death

22
00:02:26.32 --> 00:02:34.24
with hoe handles or other blunt instruments. End quote. Not only did the Kamirooge eliminate

23
00:02:34.24 --> 00:02:42.96
family life, they made sex before marriage a capital offense. Kamirooge survivor Yuk Chang

24
00:02:42.96 --> 00:02:48.08
remembered watching two young lovers beaten to death in front of his entire commune.

25
00:02:49.76 --> 00:02:55.92
In a larger sense, the Kamirooge were threatened by all expressions of love between husband and wife,

26
00:02:55.92 --> 00:03:04.88
parents and children, friends and colleagues, observes Elizabeth Becker. One Kamirooge survivor

27
00:03:04.88 --> 00:03:11.52
is still haunted by his mother's final words. You have to learn how to live without me.

28
00:03:14.64 --> 00:03:20.88
Lang Thurth, Kamirooge minister of culture and social affairs stated quote,

29
00:03:20.88 --> 00:03:28.000
only children can purely serve the revolution and eliminate reactionism since they are young,

30
00:03:28.56 --> 00:03:43.60
obedient, loyal and active. End quote. So that right there is a little excerpt from a book called

31
00:03:43.60 --> 00:03:50.48
Facing Death in Cambodia. It's written by a man named Peter McGuire. And Peter has also written

32
00:03:51.60 --> 00:03:55.28
about the Nuremberg trials about the treatment of Nazi war criminals.

33
00:03:56.80 --> 00:04:05.84
But his focus has not always been on war or genocide. He actually has a pretty significant

34
00:04:05.84 --> 00:04:10.24
dichotomy in his life. Peter McGuire grew up a surfer in Southern California.

35
00:04:10.24 --> 00:04:20.32
That led to chasing the mythical endless summer that many surfers pursue. And he funded that

36
00:04:21.12 --> 00:04:31.52
chase by drug smuggling. Eventually he left that life for academia, where he received his

37
00:04:31.52 --> 00:04:40.16
doctorate in history. Along the way, he became a jujitsu practitioner. He's a historian, an author,

38
00:04:40.16 --> 00:04:47.60
a defense contractor, college professor. And he's lived an extremely multifaceted life. And it is

39
00:04:47.60 --> 00:04:53.60
a privilege to have Peter McGuire here with us tonight to share some of his experiences

40
00:04:54.40 --> 00:04:59.04
and some of his lessons learned. Well, thank you for having me. Yeah, thanks for coming out.

41
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:06.88
I guess how did you and I originally connect? Surfer's Journal. I interviewed you. But how did

42
00:05:06.88 --> 00:05:13.92
you did you just reach out somehow? Through Ivan, I think. Through Ivan, man. So Ivan Trent is a

43
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:22.88
former seal. And the reason I knew about Ivan Trent, well, when I got to on my first deployment,

44
00:05:22.88 --> 00:05:30.24
I was on my first deployment, I went to Guam, and I walk into like the headquarters area. And

45
00:05:30.24 --> 00:05:36.72
there's a picture hanging on the wall of a guy dropping in on a giant wave, big Hawaiian wave.

46
00:05:36.72 --> 00:05:41.92
And it's signed, you know, it says, you know, some cool quote. Ivan Trent. And I'm like,

47
00:05:41.92 --> 00:05:46.88
hmm, that's interesting. Well, it's Buzzy Trent's kid. And Buzzy, Buzzy Trent is one of the iconic

48
00:05:46.88 --> 00:05:54.000
guys that opened up big wave surfing for the world. And his son was a seal. And so you did an

49
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.08
article about how did you know Ivan? I knew Ivan through the combat rescue boat that I did with

50
00:06:02.08 --> 00:06:10.88
George Greno. And so Ivan, our fathers surfed together in, you know, Malibu in the 50s. And so

51
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:18.48
yeah. And so I reached out to Ivan and he was our greatest help and a true ally. And we became great

52
00:06:18.48 --> 00:06:24.88
friends. And I stayed with him in Virginia Beach whenever I went there, would have to do jiu-jitsu

53
00:06:24.88 --> 00:06:30.64
with his son on the on the carpet. I think his son might train here. And, and then his little

54
00:06:30.64 --> 00:06:37.60
Chihuahua dog would try to hump my leg. Yeah. So Ivan has Chihuahuas. That's speaking of dichotomy.

55
00:06:37.60 --> 00:06:45.92
Well, let's get into it. And just let's go through kind of how you ended up here because you have

56
00:06:45.92 --> 00:06:53.20
been on a wild ride. I mean, relatively speaking, your life's been a wild ride. So you're born

57
00:06:54.32 --> 00:07:02.72
in 1964. Tell us about your, tell us about your mom and dad. My mother was one of the first women

58
00:07:02.72 --> 00:07:09.84
screenwriters in in Hollywood, Joan Tuxbury. She wrote Robert Altman's Nashville, among other things.

59
00:07:10.96 --> 00:07:19.04
She was actually the ostrich in Mary Martin's Peter Pan on Broadway. She was a child kind of

60
00:07:19.04 --> 00:07:28.32
Shirley Temple in Hollywood, grew up in Hollywood. And my father was the son of a famous pilot,

61
00:07:28.32 --> 00:07:35.04
Robert Maguire, who ran operations Magic Carpet and operations Alibaba flying Yemenites and

62
00:07:35.04 --> 00:07:42.08
concentration camp survivors to Israel. So at 14, my father was a mechanics assistant in Tel Aviv

63
00:07:42.08 --> 00:07:50.40
Airport. He was flying missions with my grandfather. He was flying at 14. I think it wasn't DC

64
00:07:50.40 --> 00:07:57.28
3s, but it was one of those big silver. Well, how did that, how did that happen? My grandfather was a

65
00:07:57.28 --> 00:08:06.40
pilot in World War Two, and then Alaska and airlines was hired to, to resettle Jews in Israel.

66
00:08:07.04 --> 00:08:13.52
So that's originally how he got involved. But then Alaskan Airways pulled out and he set up a company

67
00:08:13.52 --> 00:08:21.36
called Far Eastern Air Transport and flew a remarkable number of hours in a short amount of time.

68
00:08:21.36 --> 00:08:29.76
And Ben Goree and called them the Irish Moses. And the last chapter of Leon Urus's Exodus is called

69
00:08:29.76 --> 00:08:36.08
the King Crab King. And that was my grandfather who lived at Rincon, right at the indicator. And so,

70
00:08:36.72 --> 00:08:43.44
so my dad was a real wild guy. He died about a year ago. And he, so, you know, he gets,

71
00:08:43.44 --> 00:08:48.24
goes to Tel Aviv, his mother, their parents are divorced, she finds out that he's being raised

72
00:08:48.24 --> 00:08:54.96
by wolves in the Middle East. So they send him to a fancy French boarding school. He,

73
00:08:54.96 --> 00:08:59.28
So this is your dad, my dad. And so then he gets to the,

74
00:08:59.28 --> 00:09:04.24
So, so hold on. So your dad's mom realizes that your kid is, that your dad is like a

75
00:09:04.24 --> 00:09:06.24
feral child. Exactly.

76
00:09:06.24 --> 00:09:08.24
Running missions. Yeah.

77
00:09:08.24 --> 00:09:10.80
And says, we're going to get him the hell out of there. Yeah.

78
00:09:10.80 --> 00:09:13.28
I'm going to take him and send him to a French boarding school.

79
00:09:13.28 --> 00:09:17.44
Yeah. And so they send him there and the French couple that was supposed to be taking care of

80
00:09:17.44 --> 00:09:23.84
him, took the money and ran. And so he and an older kind of French nobleman whose parents

81
00:09:23.84 --> 00:09:30.72
had been killed in the Holocaust said, let's not tell anybody. And so they basically ran away

82
00:09:30.72 --> 00:09:37.12
and spent the better part of a year riding bikes around France, going to Nice, going to the

83
00:09:37.12 --> 00:09:41.92
hookers, going to the whole shebang. And then he moved to California after that. And there was

84
00:09:41.92 --> 00:09:48.48
no hope for Southern California. And so he became one of the biggest real estate developers in

85
00:09:48.48 --> 00:09:54.96
Los Angeles. He built Playa Vista and much of the skyline. And they called him the cat with

86
00:09:54.96 --> 00:10:02.32
10 lives. And so it was a boomer bust life, like, you know, up one day and then a kids were moving

87
00:10:02.32 --> 00:10:11.52
and you're going back to public school. So in my DNA, I knew the only thing that could

88
00:10:11.52 --> 00:10:18.64
be taken away from me was an education. I knew there would be no inheritance, nothing. And he

89
00:10:18.64 --> 00:10:30.64
went public in I think 2008, 2009, had a billion dollars cash and then bet it all on black and

90
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:38.08
basically bought the Blackstone Groups real estate portfolio two weeks before the subprime crisis

91
00:10:38.08 --> 00:10:47.76
and lost it all. And so he passed away about a year ago and inherited a few lawsuits.

92
00:10:49.76 --> 00:10:56.40
That's what you got out. Yeah, but he was a classic guy, you know. And so, you know, just big

93
00:10:56.40 --> 00:11:02.16
things were expected of you as a kid. I mean, my grandpa had, we always had boats. And if

94
00:11:02.80 --> 00:11:07.76
Ventura, my grandpa lived in the Ventura Keys, and if Ventura Harbor was closing out, well,

95
00:11:07.76 --> 00:11:12.88
that was a good day to take out the boat. Like, let's punch through. Yeah, yeah. And like, so that

96
00:11:12.88 --> 00:11:21.84
was not anything out of the ordinary for me. And so when I first took my job, I got my PhD at

97
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:27.76
Columbia, my PhD advisor was Brigadier General Telfer Taylor, the chief prosecutor at Nuremberg.

98
00:11:27.76 --> 00:11:37.36
And I had friends who had set up a nonprofit to collect the photographs taken at Tool Slang Prison.

99
00:11:37.36 --> 00:11:43.20
The Khmer Rouge's central torture and execution facility, roughly 20,000 went in,

100
00:11:43.84 --> 00:11:50.32
roughly 20 survived, everyone got their picture taken. So they were preserving the negatives

101
00:11:50.32 --> 00:11:56.08
and the photographic record. At that time, the Khmer Rouge was still a major force to be reckoned

102
00:11:56.08 --> 00:12:05.12
with. So this is what this is 93, 94. So I go there in early 94. And it's very volatile. The UN

103
00:12:05.12 --> 00:12:14.80
has this incredibly absurd occupation where they treat the neutrality as the sacred principle.

104
00:12:14.80 --> 00:12:20.32
So it's the, it's the UN's model that goes wrong in the 90s. So the Khmer Rouge are allowed,

105
00:12:20.32 --> 00:12:26.16
you know, allowed to run in the election. They're treated. You know, there's no accountability.

106
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:32.32
There's, you know, Khmer Rouge killed roughly, you know, we think 2 million out of 10 million.

107
00:12:32.32 --> 00:12:37.36
Yeah, it's like a quarter of the population. Yeah, in three years, 10 months, 20 days,

108
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.60
most of them, you know, with with an ox cart, a handle, the axle to the back of the head.

109
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:53.36
And no accountability when the Khmer Rouge falls in early 79 Thailand, China, Singapore,

110
00:12:53.36 --> 00:13:01.84
the US all back them. And so then Pol Pot et al become freedom fighters. And so,

111
00:13:03.04 --> 00:13:07.92
so it's just too bizarre. You couldn't make it up. And so there's absolutely no accountability. And

112
00:13:07.92 --> 00:13:15.12
I knew from my Nuremberg research is the only thing in that kind of situation, an unresolved

113
00:13:15.12 --> 00:13:22.56
conflict still fighting going on is historical accountability is preserving the empirical

114
00:13:22.56 --> 00:13:29.52
evidence of the crimes. So that was very important to me also was building the chains of command

115
00:13:29.52 --> 00:13:36.000
from the bloodstained butcher, who's usually the scapegoat. It's easy to try Lindy England or

116
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.20
these kind of people and the garden variety, you know, sort of perpetrator, but to move up to the

117
00:13:43.92 --> 00:13:49.12
food chain like they did in Nuremberg to get the shot callers, policymakers. That's what I was more

118
00:13:49.12 --> 00:13:55.92
interested in the senior leaders. And so that was my goal. I also wanted to link them to their

119
00:13:55.92 --> 00:14:04.48
their masters, the Chinese government, because, you know, this was a Chinese sponsored affair.

120
00:14:05.44 --> 00:14:09.52
There were Chinese advisors throughout Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge years,

121
00:14:09.52 --> 00:14:16.08
and the Chinese have never copped to it. And they still, we didn't support the bad policies. And,

122
00:14:16.08 --> 00:14:22.16
you know, and they, I was there when Jingxia Main came for the first time. And we went to the press

123
00:14:22.16 --> 00:14:27.20
conference and one of my friends from the Wall Street Journal said, what about accountability?

124
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:32.96
What do you say to the Cambodians? And he just started screaming at him and went, no, and stormed

125
00:14:32.96 --> 00:14:39.84
off the podium. And I went, wow, this is a different kind of press conference than I've ever been to.

126
00:14:41.04 --> 00:14:47.92
So that was my initial foray was, you know, with these photographs, finding the survivors.

127
00:14:47.92 --> 00:14:53.60
But then I was able to find the perpetrators. And I worked with a pretty remarkable guy named

128
00:14:53.60 --> 00:15:01.84
Sok Sin, who was he said, I'm remarkable survivor. And I use the weapon of the mouth.

129
00:15:02.40 --> 00:15:08.000
And I said, how did you survive the Khmer Rouge? He goes, I worked harder than any man. And I sang

130
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.76
revolutionary songs louder than any man. And yeah. And so Sok Sin was a rough guy. And he,

131
00:15:15.76 --> 00:15:22.72
you know, started as a pedicab driver. And one of the guards at the hotel that was the Fancy Hotel,

132
00:15:22.72 --> 00:15:26.72
the press state would whip him with a chain, because he'd be too aggressive. So the chain

133
00:15:26.72 --> 00:15:31.68
that blocked the driveway, he'd whip Sok Sin with. So every time Sok Sin got a new car, he would

134
00:15:31.68 --> 00:15:37.36
pull it up to that same guard who'd been there for 20 years, guarding that gate, honk the horn,

135
00:15:37.36 --> 00:15:43.92
and wave at him. And so Sok Sin taught me a lot about Cambodia, probably just driving around with

136
00:15:43.92 --> 00:15:50.96
him. I learned as much as, you know, and he would see two young lovers on a motorcycle. And he was

137
00:15:50.96 --> 00:15:56.72
like, I cannot look. And I'd say, why? He goes, he goes, I missed that. I didn't get that in my life,

138
00:15:56.72 --> 00:16:03.44
like too painful, too painful. And it was just amazing what those people went through. And,

139
00:16:04.24 --> 00:16:10.96
you know, one of my students, a professor named now named Sopa Ear, his parents were sort of

140
00:16:10.96 --> 00:16:16.72
elite Cambodians, they pushed their Mercedes out because the Cameroon came in April 17 1975.

141
00:16:16.72 --> 00:16:21.12
They said, Oh, we're just leaving for a little while. The American bombers are coming, you know,

142
00:16:21.12 --> 00:16:27.04
we just so they're pushing their Mercedes, right? And one of the kids gets separated, never sees

143
00:16:27.04 --> 00:16:32.96
them again. And then the father dies, the men always die, the women survive, the Cambodian women

144
00:16:32.96 --> 00:16:39.68
kept that society together. Very similarly, how the southern women did after the Civil War. And

145
00:16:39.68 --> 00:16:47.92
but much more extreme anyway, they go to one of those horrible rice gulags where, you know,

146
00:16:47.92 --> 00:16:55.36
they're barely given enough calories to survive. And they announced, Okay, any Vietnamese, we're

147
00:16:55.36 --> 00:17:02.72
going to allow out. But you have to take this Vietnamese language exam. You fail that exam,

148
00:17:02.72 --> 00:17:10.16
you die. And so she had had Vietnamese maids. So they coached her got her Vietnamese backup to speed.

149
00:17:10.16 --> 00:17:17.84
She passed the exam. So now they go to a refugee camp in Vietnam. She finds a phone book. And I

150
00:17:17.84 --> 00:17:26.48
don't know how starts dialing numbers in Paris, gets a sponsor. They family gets to go to Paris.

151
00:17:26.48 --> 00:17:33.52
She works as a seamstress. Then she finds out she has a relative in San Jose or Oakland. They come

152
00:17:33.52 --> 00:17:41.76
to the United States. She makes sure that she gets a fake address in the best school district

153
00:17:42.48 --> 00:17:49.12
in San Francisco, makes her kids take the bus two hours each way. Every one of those kids today,

154
00:17:49.12 --> 00:17:58.40
doctor, PhD, you know, those are the immigrants we want, right? Yeah, no, we just, we just,

155
00:17:58.40 --> 00:18:05.20
we just did another podcast and we were talking to talking about some Vietnam, Vietnamese

156
00:18:06.08 --> 00:18:11.36
immigrants that came over after the war that had gotten out. And it was the same story for all of

157
00:18:11.36 --> 00:18:18.24
them. They'd all worked so hard. And all their kids ended up just, you know, doctors, you know,

158
00:18:18.24 --> 00:18:22.72
engineers, just the whole nine yards and because education was so highly valued for them

159
00:18:22.72 --> 00:18:26.64
after they were able to get out of Vietnam. And after, you know, basically everyone that they

160
00:18:26.64 --> 00:18:33.28
knew that stayed back was murdered. Oh, yeah. Awful, just awful how that unfolded.

161
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.92
Let's rewind a little bit. We kind of jumped straight into Cambodia, but you took a strange

162
00:18:39.92 --> 00:18:49.92
path to get to Cambodia. So you're born in 1964. Yeah. That's kind of a cool time to be growing

163
00:18:49.92 --> 00:18:55.36
up and you grew up where in Malibu? Malibu Pacific Palisades. Yeah, Santa Monica Canyon.

164
00:18:55.36 --> 00:19:00.88
So this is like 19 year, what time did you start? How old were you when you started going down to

165
00:19:00.88 --> 00:19:05.84
Malibu by yourself and surfing all day, which I'm sure you must have done all the time. Well,

166
00:19:05.84 --> 00:19:12.96
we had a house in Carpenteria and then my grandpa lived at Rincon. So we were going to Santa Barbara

167
00:19:12.96 --> 00:19:17.20
pretty much like on the Rincon little point there, the cinderblock wall at the indicator.

168
00:19:18.32 --> 00:19:24.16
And that's how I met George Greno. You know, it was about 10 years old. And so I had a charmed life.

169
00:19:24.16 --> 00:19:31.52
I could go surf the Bixby Ranch and drive in and the Channel Islands. And I had a very charmed,

170
00:19:31.52 --> 00:19:39.60
I was, you know, I was a privileged kid and, and, you know, Malibu, I lived in the colony as a very

171
00:19:39.60 --> 00:19:44.80
little kid, then we moved away, but I still knew all those guys. So then I life guarded in Malibu

172
00:19:44.80 --> 00:19:50.56
colony, which was quite a quite an experience, but we were bad. So this is now the, so this is now

173
00:19:50.56 --> 00:19:57.36
what the 70s, when did you graduate from high school? 83. 83. And I was start like you said,

174
00:19:57.36 --> 00:20:03.60
going to Malibu with the older guys, smoking weed in the back of the pickup, you know, probably

175
00:20:04.56 --> 00:20:13.36
13. What kind of music were you listening to? Led Zeppelin and cream. And yeah, that, you know,

176
00:20:14.24 --> 00:20:21.12
some eagles, but yeah. And, but yeah, we were bad. And we were like free range children. All

177
00:20:21.12 --> 00:20:29.12
our parents were divorced. Very permissive time. I mean, there was, especially in Malibu, bizarre,

178
00:20:29.12 --> 00:20:35.20
like one of our friends, mothers had a primal scream room that you like walk through a giant

179
00:20:35.20 --> 00:20:42.96
vagina to get into. And just bizarre seven. Wait, what's a primal scream? You have to expand on this

180
00:20:42.96 --> 00:20:49.36
one, bro. You go in this familiar. Yeah, you go in this room and you scream, and you let it all out.

181
00:20:49.36 --> 00:20:55.12
And, and then there was, you know, there was, there was orgies and this kind of stuff. So what

182
00:20:55.12 --> 00:21:00.24
are your parents doing at this point? Like my mom was making her way in Hollywood and my dad was

183
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:06.72
were they together? No, they got and who are you living with? I lived with my mom till I was about

184
00:21:06.72 --> 00:21:14.32
10. And then she knew I needed a dad and put me with my dad and my dad was a hard ass. Like I was

185
00:21:14.32 --> 00:21:20.56
bad. And, and he kind of he had a thing where he would wake you up at five in the morning. And then

186
00:21:20.56 --> 00:21:26.16
he'd say, come downstairs, we need to talk. And, and he was always the throw weight and all the

187
00:21:26.16 --> 00:21:32.32
union stuff in LA, because he owned all the buildings. So what he did with labor was how the

188
00:21:33.36 --> 00:21:39.04
strikes went everything. And he usually sided with labor. And so he would sit you down.

189
00:21:39.04 --> 00:21:44.64
And he would just inventory the litany of your sins that you didn't think you thought you were

190
00:21:44.64 --> 00:21:51.44
getting away with everything, right? And, and it was so startling. And, and then he would just

191
00:21:51.44 --> 00:21:56.80
handle you. Okay, this, yeah, this address, you need to be down there tomorrow morning at five.

192
00:21:57.20 --> 00:22:04.72
And it was the AFL CIO local 300. So you're going to get some? Yeah, Union Hall. And so he made me

193
00:22:04.72 --> 00:22:11.60
work as a union laborer on the high rises. But little did he know my, my, you know, this was the

194
00:22:11.60 --> 00:22:16.56
punishment job. And it was a graveyard shift 11 nights to six in the morning. But I worked with

195
00:22:16.56 --> 00:22:25.36
all Darrell strawberries family. So my marijuana empire expanded exponentially, because back then

196
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.96
the there was green, there was green pot in the winter and brown pot in the summer and, you know,

197
00:22:30.96 --> 00:22:37.84
and tie. And the inner city LA couldn't get any of it. No one dared, you know, no white boys dared

198
00:22:37.84 --> 00:22:45.84
go down there. And so I did. And I go down, I go to Venice, because I knew some guys from the

199
00:22:45.84 --> 00:22:51.44
Venice gangs through athletics. And then I would go down the Crenshaw area with those guys. And I

200
00:22:51.44 --> 00:22:58.32
write about that in my book, tie stick. And then, yeah, and then I got, I got busted when I was 19.

201
00:22:58.32 --> 00:23:04.48
So hold on. So okay. So it seems like your dad, I mean, you your dad owns all these buildings.

202
00:23:05.68 --> 00:23:12.24
What what's what's getting you to you had to have looked at that even as a 15, 16, 17 year old

203
00:23:12.24 --> 00:23:17.12
and said, Hey, man, my dad's doing all right. I can probably figure out some kind of a livelihood

204
00:23:17.12 --> 00:23:21.76
by working with my dad. But how do you end up getting in the pop business?

205
00:23:21.76 --> 00:23:29.36
Um, I, I don't know. I just did. It was easy. It was right in front of me. The, you know,

206
00:23:29.36 --> 00:23:36.72
the surfers controlled the high end marijuana trade. And so particularly the tie trade. And so I,

207
00:23:37.52 --> 00:23:42.80
you know, wrote in tie stick that the arrival of the time marijuana fleet marked the beginning of

208
00:23:42.80 --> 00:23:49.12
summer. So the older surfers that I looked up to, and I would see these guys fly into Scorpion Bay,

209
00:23:49.12 --> 00:23:54.16
I mean, I first went to Scorpion Bay. I think it's 79. And it was guys on the lamb. I mean,

210
00:23:54.16 --> 00:24:00.40
it was a shady place and it was hard to get to. And so, you know, 16 years old crossing the mountains

211
00:24:00.40 --> 00:24:07.36
from the, from the sea of Cortez, you know, in my old man's suburban. And, and, you know, these

212
00:24:07.36 --> 00:24:12.80
guys would fly in for low tide and Cessna's and really good surfers. And then they, you know,

213
00:24:12.80 --> 00:24:18.56
they, they give us some cold beer because we didn't have ice, you know, like ice was the best commodity.

214
00:24:18.56 --> 00:24:24.000
And it's okay, we got to go back to Kabul for happy hour. And, you know, and they led this

215
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.52
charmed life, you know, oh, North Shore in the winter, Indonesia, you know, in the summer,

216
00:24:29.52 --> 00:24:33.68
Baha in the summer. So these guys were on the endless, these guys were literally on the endless

217
00:24:33.68 --> 00:24:42.88
summer train fueled by marijuana financed by pot. Yeah. And so, so tie pot. So you said it was

218
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:48.08
green. I forget what you said. I'm not familiar with pot because I spent my whole life well,

219
00:24:48.08 --> 00:24:51.44
I was in the military for 20 years. I grew up as like a straight edge hardcore kid. So,

220
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:58.08
yeah, I don't know enough about pot. Well, now educate me. Yeah. Well, I call it Frankenweed

221
00:24:58.08 --> 00:25:04.24
now, like it's gone way beyond. We had the what we called purple seedless, which was the Northern

222
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:09.44
California pot. Isn't that supposed to be good? Like California? Yeah, it was the best. Now,

223
00:25:09.44 --> 00:25:14.56
but it's this weird GMO pot that that's the Frankenweed. I don't like that stuff. And I don't

224
00:25:14.56 --> 00:25:22.16
think it's I don't think you should be smoking it all the time. So pot has has left me, you know,

225
00:25:22.16 --> 00:25:27.92
way behind. But anyway, so that would pretty much run out that. So it was a real Adam Smith supply

226
00:25:27.92 --> 00:25:34.000
and demand thing. So there was not unlimited amounts of good green pot all year round. So what's

227
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.68
the brown pot that would be would be Mexican, Colombian inferior pot with seeds and this and

228
00:25:41.68 --> 00:25:49.52
that but then the ties were master growers and the famous tie stick, right? And so you had pot

229
00:25:50.24 --> 00:26:00.72
in the early 70s worth $2,000 a pound. And so one sailboat full, you're a millionaire, you know,

230
00:26:00.72 --> 00:26:06.32
and so that's why so many surfers got involved in it because what do surfers need? They need

231
00:26:06.32 --> 00:26:12.40
freedom and they need time. So one sailboat full, you're a millionaire and this is in the 70s. So

232
00:26:12.40 --> 00:26:18.48
that million you're good for a life. Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, then you go, I'll do another.

233
00:26:18.48 --> 00:26:22.88
Well, I'll do a bigger boat. Oh, you know, and then all of a sudden you're dealing with tie

234
00:26:22.88 --> 00:26:28.32
gangsters, you know, bringing it across the border and Pmax gas trucks, paying million

235
00:26:28.32 --> 00:26:34.40
dollar bribes. I mean, like, you know, remarkable tradecraft actually. And then that's where I

236
00:26:34.40 --> 00:26:38.72
learned a lot of tradecraft. You have this quote. So you wrote a book called ties to come to pull

237
00:26:38.72 --> 00:26:45.12
a quote from it right now. It says one afternoon a long haired well traveled surfer came into the

238
00:26:45.12 --> 00:26:49.76
surf shop and after exchanging warm greetings and elaborate handshakes with the shopkeeper,

239
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:55.52
he threw a big plastic bag filled with greenish brown plant matter onto the counter and said,

240
00:26:55.52 --> 00:27:02.40
tie sticks, bro. That same summer, my friend found his older neighbor stash of tie sticks and stole one.

241
00:27:02.40 --> 00:27:08.08
So it was just like this seemed like the thing. You also had another good quote in there. The

242
00:27:08.08 --> 00:27:14.40
quest for utopia turned into self indulgence and narcissism. The beach was an escape, a constant

243
00:27:14.40 --> 00:27:21.12
and stable refuge during a time of uncertainty. This is like the 70s. Yeah, absolutely. And yeah,

244
00:27:21.12 --> 00:27:29.68
as I said, almost all of my peers, parents were divorced. And, you know, and luckily, athletics

245
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:33.92
grounded me very much, right? What athletics? What were you doing? Baseball, basketball,

246
00:27:33.92 --> 00:27:41.04
football from five years old to 14 years old every season with the same guys, you know,

247
00:27:41.04 --> 00:27:48.08
Pop Warner. And, you know, we were the Palisades dolphins, light blue uniforms with dolphins on

248
00:27:48.08 --> 00:27:57.36
our helmets, about 40 blonde haired white boys. And our schedule was Watts, Crenshaw. And that

249
00:27:57.36 --> 00:28:03.60
wasn't even the bad teams like Pico Rivera, with these like these Mexican teams running the wishbone,

250
00:28:03.60 --> 00:28:10.16
you know, just like, what is this? Yeah, and we're in our dorky little, you know, Palisades

251
00:28:10.16 --> 00:28:14.80
dolphins, you know, but there were some great athletes who came out of the Palisades, Steve Kerr,

252
00:28:15.36 --> 00:28:22.32
Jay Schrader. So it was interesting because back then LA was not segregated. So we were,

253
00:28:22.32 --> 00:28:28.000
you know, we were going up against the best of the blacks had to offer the best the Mexicans had to

254
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.36
offer. And we had a lot of mutual respect for each other through athletics. So what is it

255
00:28:33.36 --> 00:28:40.32
segregated now? I would say the LA riots changed things dramatically. And I saw with my younger

256
00:28:40.32 --> 00:28:47.52
half siblings, they didn't, you know, they stayed in their little, you know, enclave. Yeah. And it

257
00:28:47.52 --> 00:28:55.76
and it wasn't good, you know. And and then I, you know, then I went to private school and it was

258
00:28:55.76 --> 00:29:00.80
this is once you turn 14, 15 or whatever. Yeah. So I was public school until seventh grade,

259
00:29:00.80 --> 00:29:08.80
then I got sent to a very difficult prep school, despised it, fought at every step of the way.

260
00:29:08.80 --> 00:29:13.20
Did you have to wear a uniform and stuff? No, but just had to do about four hours of homework

261
00:29:13.20 --> 00:29:19.04
a night. And yeah, and you know, we fought a lot in public school. I mean, back then we all went

262
00:29:19.04 --> 00:29:25.52
to a park after school and played sports unsupervised always. And people fought all the time. And it

263
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:32.80
was a very honest hierarchy. And and so I had a guy try to bully me at the private school.

264
00:29:32.80 --> 00:29:38.08
And I was like, Oh, you got to be kidding me. And so I waited for cross country running day.

265
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:43.44
So we could get the furthest possible away from the coaches and then tripped him from behind. And

266
00:29:43.44 --> 00:29:50.24
then just just he and he and I let him bully me like I, you know, I, you know, from fighting a

267
00:29:50.24 --> 00:29:57.92
lot of its acting. And so I got him like, like salivating and and then, you know, I probably

268
00:29:57.92 --> 00:30:04.56
hit him 15 times in the face, unanswered. He didn't even put his hands up. And then no,

269
00:30:04.56 --> 00:30:10.72
no, but then he had, then he had like weird knots all over his head from that day forward. And I

270
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:17.92
won't tell you his last name, but it begins with an L and his name, he became lumpy L after that

271
00:30:17.92 --> 00:30:23.44
day. And then nobody bothered me at private school anymore. And then I wasn't invited back

272
00:30:23.44 --> 00:30:28.32
because I'd been on academic probation and was starting to turn pretty bad by about 10th grade.

273
00:30:28.32 --> 00:30:38.72
And and then I went to a very, very fancy movie star kid, very permissive, very liberal school

274
00:30:38.72 --> 00:30:47.12
in Santa Monica. And, and that's where I really went back because I had some, I had an old buddy

275
00:30:47.12 --> 00:30:53.76
from sports, whose family were all big Crips. And so he was there as the basketball ringer.

276
00:30:53.76 --> 00:30:59.28
So they had this ringer basketball team. And so we were involved in all kinds of, you know,

277
00:30:59.28 --> 00:31:07.12
selling weed, charging people to park at their own high school. It wasn't pretty. And I wasn't nice.

278
00:31:07.12 --> 00:31:10.16
And what's your what's your dad doing during this? He's just working his ass off all the time.

279
00:31:10.16 --> 00:31:16.72
Working his ass off kind of has a new family, new wife. And, you know, I would they're just like,

280
00:31:16.72 --> 00:31:21.44
but they would say, Well, how's Peter doing? My dad said, Well, there's still sand in the house,

281
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:28.24
so he's alive. And, and that was about it. And so then, yeah, I went, I was the only one who

282
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:35.76
didn't go to college. I moved to Australia at 18 to surf and, and had an incredible time.

283
00:31:35.76 --> 00:31:40.48
You say this in the book, tie sticks are extreme confidence in the ocean often translated to

284
00:31:40.48 --> 00:31:45.60
dangerous sense of freedom and arrogance on land at 14. I was busted by customs at Tijuana border,

285
00:31:45.60 --> 00:31:50.48
trying to smuggle fireworks at 16. I was sneaking onto private government property to surf waves

286
00:31:50.48 --> 00:31:55.92
guarded by barbed wire fences, no trespassing signs, and men with guns at 19. I moved to Australia,

287
00:31:55.92 --> 00:32:01.68
never looked back. There was very little we were not willing to do if it enabled us to

288
00:32:01.68 --> 00:32:07.68
surf perfect, uncrowded waves, whether it was bringing a few cases of Canadian whiskey through

289
00:32:07.68 --> 00:32:12.08
this through the surf during prohibition, poaching some illegal Mexican lobsters from

290
00:32:12.08 --> 00:32:17.20
officers in Vegas, working on the gambling boats anchored in international waters off Santa Monica

291
00:32:17.20 --> 00:32:23.60
pier or offloading or offloading a load of Thai marijuana. California watermen had always been

292
00:32:23.60 --> 00:32:29.60
part of the black market. Fast money, fast money bought time and freedom. That's like a history

293
00:32:29.60 --> 00:32:35.76
of what surfers have been doing for the past since since the prohibition crying out loud.

294
00:32:38.24 --> 00:32:45.20
You say by 16, marijuana was my daily bread without which no surfing session was complete.

295
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:50.32
Although there was a Western surfing association, a national scholastic surfing association,

296
00:32:50.32 --> 00:32:54.80
a Christian surfing association, and probably even a Republican surfing organization,

297
00:32:54.80 --> 00:33:00.40
my peers and I were members of the marijuana surfing association. Not all surfers smoked

298
00:33:00.40 --> 00:33:04.64
pots, some were adamantly opposed to it, but for us, pot and surfing went hand in hand.

299
00:33:04.64 --> 00:33:10.24
Not only was smoking anesthesia for that dulled life sharp edge, it was above all

300
00:33:10.24 --> 00:33:15.44
an effective time killer for our endless waiting, whether it was a swell to come, the tide to drop

301
00:33:15.44 --> 00:33:21.92
or the wind to change, we always seem to be waiting for something. You know, when one of the things

302
00:33:21.92 --> 00:33:28.16
that I tell people a lot and it seems like you're just knee deep in this, when you're young, you

303
00:33:28.16 --> 00:33:35.44
don't connect what you're doing right now with your future. And I think that's a huge problem.

304
00:33:35.44 --> 00:33:39.60
It leads kids to do the wrong things because they don't recognize that, oh,

305
00:33:39.60 --> 00:33:43.76
what I'm doing right now, this is going to impact my future, whether they're not thinking

306
00:33:43.76 --> 00:33:46.56
about their future or they don't think they can get caught or they think they can get away with

307
00:33:46.56 --> 00:33:50.64
anything or they think they're immortal, all those things. It seems like you were just knee

308
00:33:50.64 --> 00:33:57.44
deep into, hey, I'm living for the moment right now. That's it. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I,

309
00:33:57.44 --> 00:34:02.40
it took a long time to repair the damage because I went to Australia.

310
00:34:02.40 --> 00:34:09.60
So, did you graduate from high school? Yeah. And then once you graduated from high school,

311
00:34:09.60 --> 00:34:14.08
now you're 18, 19 years old? No, no, I'm 18. So you're 18 years old and

312
00:34:14.80 --> 00:34:19.60
does your dad want you to go to college? Did you get good grades? No, but I was always working. I

313
00:34:19.60 --> 00:34:26.64
always had a couple jobs. So I was always, I had a union job or, you know, I was, I was,

314
00:34:26.64 --> 00:34:35.28
I was never lazy and I was always motivated just by not traditional things. And so I would work my

315
00:34:35.28 --> 00:34:42.000
ass off and then I would sell, you know, pot on top of that. But, you know, very kind of only pot,

316
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.36
only to adults, only large quantities, never to kids or like a dealer. I really kind of frowned

317
00:34:49.36 --> 00:34:58.80
on that. And just saving all my money for the big surf trip, right? And so I did that for about

318
00:34:58.80 --> 00:35:05.84
10 months after high school. Then I flew to Australia and I lived at Brokenhead Point between

319
00:35:05.84 --> 00:35:14.000
Byron Bay and Lenox Head with a famous old shaper named Michael Cundith. And George Greeno was our

320
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.16
neighbor who I knew a little bit from Santa Barbara and it was just bliss. And I traveled all over

321
00:35:20.16 --> 00:35:24.56
Australia with some of the best surfers of the time. One of my best friends was a guy named

322
00:35:24.56 --> 00:35:31.68
Ant Corrigan who was the best surfer of his generation, schoolboy Cadet Champ. They wanted

323
00:35:31.68 --> 00:35:36.64
him on the pro tour. He went to work at the pub instead. And I loved the Aussies because they

324
00:35:36.64 --> 00:35:41.76
didn't care if you're a dick, you're a dick and they're going to call you out on it. And, you

325
00:35:41.76 --> 00:35:48.24
know, the pubs and the drinking and fighting and fighting and fighting. And, you know, it was a

326
00:35:48.24 --> 00:35:57.76
wild time, the Aussies. And I had a ball. And then I went to Micronesia, I surfed Micronesia, New

327
00:35:57.76 --> 00:36:07.76
Caledonia, Fiji before Tavaruea, then French Polynesia. And then I had a Tahitian girlfriend.

328
00:36:07.76 --> 00:36:14.72
And I thought I had died and gone to heaven. And I'm there and it just, it was too good. And then

329
00:36:14.72 --> 00:36:20.32
suddenly. So now are you 19 now? Yeah, I'm 19. You're 19 years old. Damn, that's, you're rolling.

330
00:36:20.32 --> 00:36:26.08
And so suddenly a strange car pulls up in the driveway. And I look. Okay, so you wait a second

331
00:36:26.08 --> 00:36:30.88
now. You're in Tahiti at this point. Yeah. You got a Tahitian girlfriend at her house. You're

332
00:36:30.88 --> 00:36:38.88
surfing, living the dream. Yeah. And you're in her house. Yeah. Living there, staying there. And

333
00:36:38.88 --> 00:36:47.84
now what do we get? Strange car pulls up. Fat middle age Frenchman jumps out. Eyes pop this far

334
00:36:47.84 --> 00:36:56.48
out of his head. Knocks me out of the way, runs straight for the bed, rips the sheets off the

335
00:36:56.48 --> 00:37:05.20
bed, starts smelling the bed like a dog. I run and grab my passport, whatever I can find and

336
00:37:05.20 --> 00:37:11.20
fucking leave half of my shit there and beat feet onto this street up in the hills above

337
00:37:11.20 --> 00:37:19.04
Papi Ate. And I'm just going like, what she said? She loved me. And so now I'm in the Kuei and

338
00:37:19.04 --> 00:37:25.60
Papi Ate. I check into some Tiji hotel. Turns out it has like a transvestite disco in it. And

339
00:37:25.60 --> 00:37:30.64
I was really pretty blonde haired surfer back then. And you know, and I'm basically, I had to

340
00:37:30.64 --> 00:37:37.84
barricade my door. And then I'm like, I gotta go. I'm going back to LA. So I get back to LA after

341
00:37:37.84 --> 00:37:46.08
about a year away. And I see my friends are basically sitting stoned in the same chairs I left them

342
00:37:46.08 --> 00:37:53.68
in a year earlier. And I had kind of a moment of satori and said, like, I'm out of here. I'm never

343
00:37:53.68 --> 00:37:59.92
living here again. And I'm getting as far away from this fucking place as I can. And so

344
00:37:59.92 --> 00:38:10.48
that's a weird thing to have, because it seemed like everything was kind of, I mean, other than this

345
00:38:10.48 --> 00:38:15.52
big French dude who kind of rolled in on your dreams. But you know, you could find another

346
00:38:15.52 --> 00:38:21.28
Tahitian girl or another girl or I mean, not one that was sponsoring me. That's good. That's

347
00:38:21.28 --> 00:38:27.84
good. So he was technically sponsoring your aspects. But you get back to LA. Okay, so your

348
00:38:27.84 --> 00:38:32.96
friends are still kind of stoned and they're surfing or whatever. But it's weird. It seems

349
00:38:32.96 --> 00:38:40.000
like that's an extreme viewpoint to suddenly have unless I guess the connection that I just was

350
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.64
talking about where people don't understand that what they're doing now impacts their future.

351
00:38:44.64 --> 00:38:49.52
So that's probably what it was. You made this connection between, oh, I've been gone for a

352
00:38:49.52 --> 00:38:52.88
year and these guys are doing the same thing. And they're going to be doing that in five years.

353
00:38:52.88 --> 00:38:56.64
They're going to be doing that in 10 years. Oh, what I'm doing right now is going to impact my

354
00:38:56.64 --> 00:39:02.88
future. So maybe you did make that connection. Well, also, I had surfed such good waves and

355
00:39:02.88 --> 00:39:10.16
so many good waves. I mean, Lenox head back then, light crowds, the outer reefs of Cape

356
00:39:10.16 --> 00:39:17.28
Iron, you know, big waves, broken head point every day. So that I got back, I was like,

357
00:39:17.28 --> 00:39:24.08
okay, I'm going backwards now, like I've done all this. And so I found this college of small,

358
00:39:24.08 --> 00:39:30.24
another extreme liberal liberal arts school Bard College. And at that time, I think there were

359
00:39:30.24 --> 00:39:37.20
about 750 students. And they basically took your pulse and saw that your check cleared and you

360
00:39:37.20 --> 00:39:43.60
could get in. And so they had an immediate decision plan. So I flew back, I'd been in LA maybe four

361
00:39:43.60 --> 00:39:49.04
or five days, I found out about it, I flew to New York, I got in. Was it just timing wise? It

362
00:39:49.04 --> 00:39:53.44
happened to be in the fall or whatever, whenever they were accepting people. Yeah, August. Yeah,

363
00:39:53.44 --> 00:39:59.92
they had a they had a rolling admittance thing. And it was basically almost an art school and in

364
00:39:59.92 --> 00:40:06.08
a remarkable place. And it was up in the woods of New York state. And I got really into hunting

365
00:40:06.08 --> 00:40:14.32
and fishing. And so I just I fished at a trout stream on my college campus. And I fished and

366
00:40:14.32 --> 00:40:21.36
hunted every single day. And I had seven weeks off for Christmas, so I'd go to the North Shore

367
00:40:21.36 --> 00:40:26.56
every Christmas. And then I'd go to Scorpion Bay every summer. So I'd work in the unions, make money,

368
00:40:26.56 --> 00:40:31.52
and then go to Scorpion Bay. So I still got to surf a lot. But I became a pretty serious student.

369
00:40:31.52 --> 00:40:37.76
And it was not easy because I was damaged goods, because I hadn't done shit in high school. So

370
00:40:37.76 --> 00:40:44.40
I was, like you said, making up for these errors. And I was there with these, you know, really

371
00:40:44.40 --> 00:40:51.60
privileged kids from the East Coast. And like, for example, I had never, ever contemplated doing,

372
00:40:51.60 --> 00:40:57.28
you know, heroin or anything like that. The first time I even heard about it was on the East Coast

373
00:40:57.28 --> 00:41:05.60
with the most privileged children of America. And it was horrifying to me. And so I became a

374
00:41:05.60 --> 00:41:15.28
very, very serious student and had some incredible professors and wrote a really first rate thesis

375
00:41:15.28 --> 00:41:21.20
on my great grandfather's time at Nuremberg. Before we get there, it seems like you had a moment of

376
00:41:21.20 --> 00:41:28.08
clarity also when it came to the marijuana business. So in the book, tie sticks, you say,

377
00:41:29.04 --> 00:41:35.12
you get pulled over. And you say, the officer took one look at my bloodshot eyes, caught a

378
00:41:35.12 --> 00:41:40.56
whiff of the car's interior and asked, son, are you transporting narcotics across state lines?

379
00:41:41.52 --> 00:41:46.08
In that moment, under the dark desert sky, I told myself, if I got out of this jam, I would never

380
00:41:46.08 --> 00:41:51.84
put myself in this position again. Although I continued to smoke pot, I never trafficked again.

381
00:41:51.84 --> 00:41:54.24
So how did you get that? How did you get through that?

382
00:41:56.88 --> 00:42:04.24
You know, tradecraft on some level, I had, you know, I was like a half a pound or a quarter pound.

383
00:42:05.28 --> 00:42:11.60
And it was vacuum bagged and wiped down with the gas or some solvent in the cushion of the

384
00:42:11.60 --> 00:42:20.32
driver's seat. And it was a hatchback Mustang GT. And I'd been driving straight from LA and was

385
00:42:20.32 --> 00:42:27.12
all the way at the border of Texas and New Mexico. And I had two joints for the drive.

386
00:42:27.12 --> 00:42:31.36
And this was just for my personal consumption in college, because there was no good pot on these

387
00:42:31.36 --> 00:42:39.20
ghosts. And so, so I'm smoking my second joint, and I drop it on the ground. I turn on the

388
00:42:39.20 --> 00:42:46.64
interior light, I pass a cop going about 85, I don't even see him. And I see, you know, he lights

389
00:42:46.64 --> 00:42:52.40
so far back and say, oh, that can't be for me. And then I'm hit with a spotlight. And he's on the,

390
00:42:52.40 --> 00:42:57.28
on the PA going, keep your hands on the steering wheel and pull over to the start of the road.

391
00:42:57.28 --> 00:43:05.52
So I'm rolling down both windows, the Cheech and Chong shows going on. And I take a really long

392
00:43:05.52 --> 00:43:12.56
time to stop. And so, and he walks up. Yeah, no, he said, son, he said, there's a fruity,

393
00:43:12.56 --> 00:43:19.52
herbal aroma in the car and a brown stain on your lip. And I just said, no, sir, that's all I would

394
00:43:19.52 --> 00:43:26.40
say no sir. Okay, I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the car. Yeah, do I have consent to

395
00:43:26.40 --> 00:43:32.96
search. So I gave him the keys, hoping he would open it without, and he was too smart. So he said,

396
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:38.64
he made me give him consent. And then he started pulling my bags out. And one had a bunch of blocks

397
00:43:38.64 --> 00:43:43.52
of white surfboard wax and up against the car. And he was sure it was like Coke or something.

398
00:43:43.52 --> 00:43:49.76
So then he kind of and then he's going through all my bags. And then I have these bundles of slides

399
00:43:49.76 --> 00:43:55.12
and brown paper with duct tape wrapped around him up against the car. And so he gets two big buildups,

400
00:43:55.12 --> 00:44:00.32
two strikes and now we're like 20 minutes into it. And he's an American Indian. And

401
00:44:00.32 --> 00:44:08.32
and and then finally he's he's you know, my my seats are still folded down. He hasn't folded the

402
00:44:08.32 --> 00:44:14.32
seats up. I have surfboards. I have all kinds of conversation. So he's asking me about this. And

403
00:44:14.32 --> 00:44:20.08
we he's kind of real. Okay, this guy's not that bad. And then and then he says, son, we're going to

404
00:44:20.08 --> 00:44:27.04
strike a little deal. And going, Oh, boy. And he goes, you're going to keep it under 55. While

405
00:44:27.04 --> 00:44:32.48
you're in New Mexico, and we're going to call it even. And that was the hardest part because I was

406
00:44:32.48 --> 00:44:40.24
going to jump in his arms. Oh, never do it again. And I really never did it again. And and that was

407
00:44:40.24 --> 00:44:46.000
that because I you know, I had I had made it over the Rubicon, you know, and I had turned my life

408
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.08
around. But I almost fucked it up out of just, you know, arrogance and stupidity, you know,

409
00:44:52.08 --> 00:44:55.84
you track on any of the friends that you had back from that era.

410
00:44:55.84 --> 00:45:00.000
Absolutely. I'm still friends with all of them for better or worse. Yeah, all of them.

411
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.84
Some surfed with them in Malibu yesterday. And you know, that some of them have been,

412
00:45:06.64 --> 00:45:10.40
you know, real heavy lifters when it comes to drugs, you know, like, they should

413
00:45:10.40 --> 00:45:15.92
take them to the Mayo Clinic and test them because from crack to fentanyl to and lost a lot of

414
00:45:15.92 --> 00:45:22.000
friends to fentanyl lost a lot of friends to opiates in the last few years. So fentanyl,

415
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.80
fentanyl is a fake or a man made opioid. Is that what it is? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it's what a

416
00:45:30.80 --> 00:45:35.76
thousand times stronger than or something. Do you know the actual number? How much? No, it depends

417
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:43.44
on the ratio, but it's it's it's orders of magnitude. And you know, and it's in my opinion,

418
00:45:43.44 --> 00:45:49.68
asymmetrical warfare against the United States by China. And so the Chinese ship the chemicals

419
00:45:49.68 --> 00:45:57.36
to the Mexican cartels, they make them thanks to our porous border. It comes across. I mean, we had

420
00:45:57.36 --> 00:46:02.88
where do you get the like, what, where does this theory come from that the Chinese are sending

421
00:46:02.88 --> 00:46:10.000
the chemicals to Mexico? It's it's fairly well known because they would get American medical

422
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:18.40
journals that had drug recipes that were too addictive that weren't ever approved. And and

423
00:46:18.40 --> 00:46:26.48
and whether it's I don't see it as as like Dr. Evil, you know, with his pinky in his mouth coming up,

424
00:46:26.48 --> 00:46:35.04
but look at the impact that it's had on America in last year, more Americans died than 108,000

425
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:40.64
Americans died of ODs. So that's more than Korea, Vietnam and the war on terror combined.

426
00:46:41.44 --> 00:46:46.72
And nobody seems to be two up in arms about it. Is that one year? One year.

427
00:46:46.72 --> 00:46:52.24
108,000. Yeah, according to the CDC, as a parent, that scares me more than anything.

428
00:46:52.24 --> 00:46:56.80
So the reason it scares you as a parent, because your kid can be at a party, and someone says,

429
00:46:56.80 --> 00:47:01.04
hey, you want to take some ecstasy, exactly, and they take ecstasy, but it turns out being

430
00:47:01.04 --> 00:47:05.76
fentanyl laced and they're dead. Yeah, and that happened in my town in North Carolina. The kid

431
00:47:05.76 --> 00:47:11.76
was a sports star getting ready to go to college, you know, senior party, let's take some ecstasy

432
00:47:11.76 --> 00:47:16.88
and boof. It happened some Naval Academy students, right? Yeah, some Naval Academy students in Florida

433
00:47:16.88 --> 00:47:23.68
down there partying. Yeah, a couple of them died. I mean, just like a horror. Yeah, it is. And to me,

434
00:47:24.96 --> 00:47:32.16
I mean, enforcing drug policies are difficult, but you know, and then you look at like Purdue

435
00:47:32.16 --> 00:47:42.08
Pharma and how the opiate crisis came to America and the corruption. I mean, that's at our core,

436
00:47:42.08 --> 00:47:49.76
that's the nation's problem now is just a kind of corruption I saw in Cambodia. And, you know,

437
00:47:49.76 --> 00:47:55.20
where, you know, Pelosi's husband's buying the stock that she's about to approve or Hunter's

438
00:47:55.20 --> 00:48:04.32
laptop or this kind of stuff. And it's a bipartisan game. I'm not, you know, I just, it's, you know,

439
00:48:04.32 --> 00:48:10.000
and like we were saying prior to the interview, everybody's in too deep with the Chinese to

440
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.36
really call them out on anything. And our obsession with Russia is conspicuous to me compared to the

441
00:48:17.36 --> 00:48:23.92
blind eye we turned to China. Now with Taiwan, we're starting to firm up a little bit. But that's

442
00:48:23.92 --> 00:48:30.000
sleep. We're sleepwalking basically. And we're, you know, foreign policy has public relations.

443
00:48:30.56 --> 00:48:38.08
And to have the same neoconservatives back, like you, you know, so succinctly talk about,

444
00:48:39.52 --> 00:48:45.20
I forget your exact phrase, but, you know, taking responsibility for your failures. And

445
00:48:45.84 --> 00:48:51.76
extreme ownership, I think. And we look at these foreign policy elites that have just been wrong

446
00:48:51.76 --> 00:48:58.80
on wrong and wrong. And I've had moments where I got to write for the big periodicals and stuff

447
00:48:58.80 --> 00:49:05.68
like that. But I always went too far. And I always, I mean, I was all over Soros's guys during the

448
00:49:05.68 --> 00:49:11.60
90s because they were utopians. Oh, the international criminal court with universal jurisdiction.

449
00:49:11.60 --> 00:49:17.28
It's like, well, we kind of tried that Woodrow Wilson and it didn't work out so well. And all

450
00:49:17.28 --> 00:49:22.000
those people went on to huge positions, you know, Ben Rhodes, Samantha Powers, these were

451
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
cub reporters. These are my peers. And, you know, you played ball, you got tapped, you got pushed

452
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.12
to the head of the class. And so I was in the odd position where I was critical of the war on terror

453
00:49:35.12 --> 00:49:40.40
from a policy perspective and thought it could have, you know, particularly when it went to Iraq

454
00:49:40.40 --> 00:49:46.88
because I had friends at the Army War College that I would call and say, what really impressive guy,

455
00:49:47.76 --> 00:49:52.96
Lieutenant Colonel Conrad Crane, who was Petraeus's brain, really. And he was the

456
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:58.72
author of the counterinsurgency manual. And, you know, and he said, yeah, Tom Warwick from the

457
00:49:58.72 --> 00:50:04.96
State Department, who I had argued with about war crime stuff. He said he wrote the whole

458
00:50:04.96 --> 00:50:10.88
occupation plan. They had it like eight volumes. And Rumsfeld said, Warwick State Department,

459
00:50:10.88 --> 00:50:17.44
chuck it. And so people on the inside were nervous and kind of going like, wow, we don't

460
00:50:17.44 --> 00:50:25.28
really know where this is going, but it's going. And, and, you know, like, you know, worse than a

461
00:50:25.28 --> 00:50:30.24
an error is a blunder. And it's kind of blundering. And, you know,

462
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:37.68
yeah, I would say worse than an error is to not assess your situation. Exactly. Oh, yeah. You

463
00:50:37.68 --> 00:50:42.72
know what? I was wrong about this. And here's the adjustments we need to make now. Yeah. And it took

464
00:50:42.72 --> 00:50:49.12
so long to, for any kind of that type of recognition that it was ridiculous. And then Libyan and

465
00:50:49.12 --> 00:50:54.000
Syria and keep rolling, you know, and now work this time. And by the way, you know, you can go

466
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.80
all the way back to Vietnam, you can look at the exact, it's just the exact same thing. It's the

467
00:50:58.80 --> 00:51:04.000
exact same thing in Vietnam. Everything that was going on. It's like, Oh, the generals only listen

468
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.36
to the politicians only listen to the generals and the generals only listen to themselves.

469
00:51:07.36 --> 00:51:11.84
Yeah. And no one's actually talking to the troops on the ground that know what's happening and

470
00:51:11.84 --> 00:51:18.80
could actually devise a way to move forward in a positive way. Doesn't happen. No freaking ridiculous.

471
00:51:22.32 --> 00:51:27.12
All right. So going back to going back to little tangential discussions, all good.

472
00:51:27.12 --> 00:51:33.68
Going back to you. So you end up in college, you go into this barred, barred college, and you're,

473
00:51:34.32 --> 00:51:41.36
you're having a good time. You enjoy it. Yeah. And you so talk to me about your your master's

474
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:47.92
thesis. Well, no, just undergraduate. Okay. And I won a bunch of awards. So what was it?

475
00:51:48.48 --> 00:51:52.000
I was on the Nuremberg trials and the secret release of the convicted Nazis

476
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:58.40
to trade to get German rearmament. Basically, the Germans say, and the Germans were masterful,

477
00:51:58.40 --> 00:52:03.28
you know, and I mean, statecraft, come on, we're going to beat them. And they said, Oh,

478
00:52:03.28 --> 00:52:08.72
you have to release our prisoners of war if you want a German army. And now, you know,

479
00:52:08.72 --> 00:52:18.72
with the Soviet Union seeming to be menacing in Europe, Berlin splitting. And the Germans are

480
00:52:18.72 --> 00:52:25.60
pouring gas on it, you know, and so hit one of Hitler's best spy masters on the Soviet Union,

481
00:52:25.60 --> 00:52:31.12
Reinhard Galen, he took all their records on the Soviet Union, buried them and then surrendered

482
00:52:31.12 --> 00:52:37.52
to the US. And he said, Okay, you want that? You get all my guys off the war crimes list.

483
00:52:37.52 --> 00:52:42.72
And yeah, we'll give you all the intelligence you want on the Soviet Union. So they flew Galen at

484
00:52:42.72 --> 00:52:49.44
Al to the United States. And he would he would kind of hype up the Soviet threat to keep the

485
00:52:49.44 --> 00:52:57.84
Americans, you know, on their heels. And, and so the Germans masterfully manipulated us. And we

486
00:52:57.84 --> 00:53:03.52
wound up freeing some of the worst German war criminals like some of the Einsatz commandos,

487
00:53:03.52 --> 00:53:09.84
Einsatzgruppen who followed the Wehrmacht, and we're just pure executioners. And, and so,

488
00:53:09.84 --> 00:53:17.60
you know, that was quite alarming. When I was younger, I was a little more idealistic before I

489
00:53:17.60 --> 00:53:25.04
did field work. And, and so I then, and it was an interesting so that that became my PhD advisor

490
00:53:25.04 --> 00:53:30.56
dissertation. So then I went to Columbia to study with Brigadier General Telfer Taylor,

491
00:53:30.56 --> 00:53:37.80
who was the chief prosecutor, scary guy. And there's scary in what way there's a, well, he,

492
00:53:37.80 --> 00:53:43.000
I think he argued, I don't know how many Supreme Court cases. There's a famous movie called The

493
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.96
Paper Chase about law school. And John Hausman is this really, yeah, he was John Hausman times 10.

494
00:53:50.60 --> 00:53:57.80
And, and, and if you went off topic talking to him, he would just close his book on it. So I see

495
00:53:57.80 --> 00:54:04.76
we're finished today. And that was it, you were dismissed. And, you know, and old fashioned law

496
00:54:04.76 --> 00:54:11.80
school, you go Jones, tell me about the Smith Act. And you get two shots the whole semester. And if

497
00:54:11.80 --> 00:54:18.68
you blow it, that's half your grade. And so, wait, so this is Columbia Law School? Well, I got my

498
00:54:18.68 --> 00:54:24.20
PhD in history, but I also took classes in law school, and the School of International Affairs,

499
00:54:24.20 --> 00:54:31.88
and had some incredible professors. And, and it was horrible. I hated every minute of it.

500
00:54:31.88 --> 00:54:39.56
I'm so glad I did it now. But it was, you know, like being locked in a boxcar for four years or

501
00:54:39.56 --> 00:54:43.24
something. I mean, what was your vision at that time for your life? Like, what did you see yourself

502
00:54:43.24 --> 00:54:47.24
doing? Did you want to go into journalism? Did you want to be a professor? What did you want to do?

503
00:54:47.24 --> 00:54:53.24
I thought I was going to go to law school. And then I got my master's in history. I wrote another

504
00:54:53.24 --> 00:55:00.36
thesis another one another step further on Nuremberg. And then I got into Columbia Law School,

505
00:55:00.36 --> 00:55:05.88
Journalism School, and History. And they, they, at that point, you're kind of a professional

506
00:55:05.88 --> 00:55:12.04
athlete. So you get no tuition, you get money, and all that in the history. And then I kind of

507
00:55:12.04 --> 00:55:18.52
pitted them all against each other. And I got the best deal from history. And I was still not

508
00:55:18.52 --> 00:55:25.16
totally committed to academia. I just, you know, was getting a free PhD. And I, I really enjoyed

509
00:55:25.16 --> 00:55:30.04
it. And I was going to write a book. And so I think it was journalism more moving in that direction.

510
00:55:30.04 --> 00:55:36.84
But, but I was always kind of more active person. I didn't want to just sit on the sidelines. And

511
00:55:36.84 --> 00:55:43.32
then the opportunity came as I finished to go to Cambodia. And it was what I wanted to do.

512
00:55:43.32 --> 00:55:49.64
So, so how'd that opportunity spring up? As I said, these two guys I grew up with in, in,

513
00:55:50.28 --> 00:55:57.40
in California, were photographers for agency France Press, they stumbled across the cash

514
00:55:57.40 --> 00:56:04.52
of negatives at Tool Slang Prison. And they set up a secret darkroom and we're printing them and,

515
00:56:04.52 --> 00:56:11.16
and really preserving the original negatives, the evidence of, of war crimes. And that I, I knew

516
00:56:11.16 --> 00:56:18.44
that's the key though, punishing the individuals is obviously important, but creating an empirical

517
00:56:18.44 --> 00:56:25.80
record of the crimes. That's what's made Holocaust revisionism so difficult. Because

518
00:56:25.80 --> 00:56:33.000
Nuremberg created an unassailable historical record. So that's where my mind was, I didn't think that

519
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:41.08
they would ever try anybody. And it will, and in fact, they did. And I played a small role in

520
00:56:41.08 --> 00:56:46.84
keeping those issues alive, preserving the evidence and passing that evidence on to the Cambodian

521
00:56:47.72 --> 00:56:55.24
documentation center. And I worked closely with them as I went further on. And so what year is

522
00:56:55.24 --> 00:57:04.52
this now? So this would be 94 is my first trip. And then when did you go side note? When did you

523
00:57:04.52 --> 00:57:12.04
start training Jiu Jitsu? I was training in Jeet Kune Do first with a guy named John Peretti in

524
00:57:12.04 --> 00:57:20.12
New York City, who was a former pro kickboxer, and a real badass who fought on Indian reservations and

525
00:57:20.12 --> 00:57:28.12
was fighting like MMA matches in the tunnels beneath Chinatown. And before the era of closed

526
00:57:28.12 --> 00:57:37.96
circuit TV, he had those ASIC Tiger shoes, and he was so steel toes in them. And, and, and, you know,

527
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:43.24
and we get in all kinds of fights in New York City and beat up bad people. And he encouraged us to do

528
00:57:43.24 --> 00:57:52.84
that. And, and, and, and John Donahue was kind of around a bit at that time. And so I was, you

529
00:57:52.84 --> 00:57:59.000
know, I was training with Freddie, a lot of kickboxing. And he was a real, a very brilliant guy,

530
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.16
an odd guy, very sadistic in his training. Everything was live full contact. And he would

531
00:58:05.16 --> 00:58:13.16
bring in incredible fighters that he knew he brought in a sumo wrestler, Igor Zanoviev, who fought

532
00:58:13.16 --> 00:58:18.12
a beat Mario Sperry, we met him when he had just come. And he was fighting underground fights.

533
00:58:19.40 --> 00:58:27.08
A Russian fencer who is the fastest human I've ever seen, only in one direction. And, you know,

534
00:58:27.08 --> 00:58:33.72
small arms stuff and all kinds of different things. And, and we were all kind of scared of

535
00:58:33.72 --> 00:58:40.52
wrestlers. And, and Peretti talked about fighting this Russian wrestler, who almost broke his neck

536
00:58:40.52 --> 00:58:45.72
and killed him in the first round of their challenge match. And then he knocked him out so

537
00:58:45.72 --> 00:58:51.40
unconscious that he thought he killed him in the second round. But that left a big mark. So, so he

538
00:58:51.40 --> 00:58:58.76
never, he encouraged us to finish our fights on the hardwood floor. And, and so we had no mats.

539
00:58:58.76 --> 00:59:06.12
And, and, and not many people lasted that long in that school. And, and then I heard about the

540
00:59:06.12 --> 00:59:15.24
Garcia brothers, the Mexican guys, the Garcia brothers. And, and that was, that was the Gracie's.

541
00:59:15.24 --> 00:59:21.24
And so then I had a friend who was a college wrestler and he said, oh yeah, I'm training with,

542
00:59:21.24 --> 00:59:27.80
with Hicks and Gracie and on Pico. And so you came back out to California. I come every summer.

543
00:59:27.80 --> 00:59:32.76
So when you spent your summer in California, you got to, that's the first time you went down to

544
00:59:32.76 --> 00:59:40.12
Pico. Yeah, I went first time. I think 92, I got a private. And then Hicks and said, come back,

545
00:59:40.12 --> 00:59:45.96
you know, come back and really train. And so then the next summer I trained, you know, three days a

546
00:59:45.96 --> 00:59:54.36
week in the men's, open men's daytime class. And my friend used to say it was, it was lunchtime on

547
00:59:54.36 --> 01:00:02.68
the prison yard. And it was, you know, we had Eric, 94, 95, no 93, 93. So this was Eric Paul

548
01:00:02.68 --> 01:00:12.68
Wilson. John Lewis was in there as a wipeout. And, and as I said in the book, like, they were minor

549
01:00:12.68 --> 01:00:20.60
compared to like guys like you, then there was like prison extraction unit guards that were so big.

550
01:00:20.60 --> 01:00:29.72
And the, the gnarliest guy was an offshore oil rig, like pull a pipe joiner guy was like 300 pounds.

551
01:00:29.72 --> 01:00:36.68
And he would just grab a wrist and like peel, they just take things. And yeah, Paul Vunak was in there.

552
01:00:37.80 --> 01:00:44.44
And then just all the karaoke Brazilian Rio guys coming here and coming there. And, and, and I

553
01:00:44.44 --> 01:00:48.52
surfed well and they knew me from surfing. So they liked that. And I was a good standup fighter.

554
01:00:48.52 --> 01:00:54.20
So, and we had to do a lot of standup back then and Luis LeMau would put on these, these ridiculous

555
01:00:54.20 --> 01:01:00.60
leather boxing gloves and, and I do my Bruce Lee stuff and they all like Hicks and kids thought it

556
01:01:00.60 --> 01:01:07.88
was the best, you know, and, and, and it was a great time, you know, and, and Hicks and I became good

557
01:01:07.88 --> 01:01:16.92
friends. And not that deep. But then we both kind of had a pivotal moment in both of our lives. And

558
01:01:16.92 --> 01:01:23.08
it was when I was going to start in Cambodia, and he was going to fight in Japan. And we would run

559
01:01:23.08 --> 01:01:28.36
into each other at sunrise at Malibu. And just there's Hicks and Hey, Hicks and, and we talk,

560
01:01:28.36 --> 01:01:36.68
you know, for an hour. And, and I don't think I've had any superficial conversations with Hicks and

561
01:01:36.68 --> 01:01:44.44
in 30 years. And it's always straight to the guts of it. And then I started, you know, going to Cambodia

562
01:01:44.44 --> 01:01:52.76
and a lot of times I would come straight back from a gnarly trip, right to his house, always

563
01:01:52.76 --> 01:01:59.48
unannounced in the same clothes I've been wearing, smelling like wood smoke and kind of spun out on

564
01:01:59.48 --> 01:02:06.12
volumes and beers and because you can't sleep after you get that wound up, right. And, and he'd take

565
01:02:06.12 --> 01:02:13.000
one look at me and he'd go, take off your boots. And he said, let's play around a little bit. And

566
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.96
he wouldn't even let me start my show and tell. And then I'd have like a two hour private in, in

567
01:02:17.96 --> 01:02:25.88
like street clothes. And then he'd say, okay, like, what the fuck happened to you on this one? And so

568
01:02:25.88 --> 01:02:30.52
and then I would tell him these like these martial arts scenarios, like fighting on motorcycles,

569
01:02:30.52 --> 01:02:38.20
I got attacked on motorcycles once. And, and like had a full 3040 mile an hour fight on motorcycles

570
01:02:38.20 --> 01:02:44.60
with three guys trying to pull me off and we made them crash. And then a lot of mob stuff. And as

571
01:02:44.60 --> 01:02:51.000
I was saying earlier, this is all in Cambodia. Yeah, in Cambodia, like in gosh, I don't know,

572
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.96
I think about 99. They attack the Cambodian government orchestrated mobs that attacked the

573
01:02:57.96 --> 01:03:04.84
Thai embassy. And the Thai ambassador had to escape in a speedboat. And any Thai business was ransacked

574
01:03:04.84 --> 01:03:12.44
by kind of government orchestrated mobs, icons, but in plain clothes, Molotov cocktails. And,

575
01:03:12.44 --> 01:03:19.08
and I was always saying earlier, I really began to see the mob as this like organic organism that,

576
01:03:19.08 --> 01:03:26.76
you know, feeds on the sound of broken glass and the smell of fire. And, and they were all on

577
01:03:26.76 --> 01:03:33.56
motorcycles. And they would the military police would come and disperse them. And then you'd hear

578
01:03:33.56 --> 01:03:39.24
the beep, beep, beep, beep, and they'd all honk their horns and they'd reform up. And it went on

579
01:03:39.24 --> 01:03:44.84
and it went on all night. And you'd hear the beep, beep, beep. And then, and this was my wife's first

580
01:03:44.84 --> 01:03:50.28
trip to Cambodia. So you're bringing your wife on these trips? No, this was supposed to be a Mello

581
01:03:50.28 --> 01:03:55.64
one. Okay. Yeah, I said, Oh, no, it's Mello. It's not bad anymore. And this brings up out of nowhere.

582
01:03:55.64 --> 01:04:01.16
And, and this we were in the capital this time. And I was not expecting much. And she goes, Oh,

583
01:04:01.16 --> 01:04:10.52
look, fireworks. I go, those are tracers. And, and so, and it was a remarkable thing. You know,

584
01:04:10.52 --> 01:04:18.68
that really stuck with me of, of, and I think, as a society, we're moving towards this point of,

585
01:04:18.68 --> 01:04:25.88
of, you know, this mob gets kind of the military police heard them down this narrow street. And so

586
01:04:25.88 --> 01:04:30.84
they're, they're like five abreast all in those little motorcycles, two or three guys on the

587
01:04:30.84 --> 01:04:36.52
motorcycle. And they're kind of street punks, right? And there's three military policemen,

588
01:04:36.52 --> 01:04:44.20
all hard old, probably former Khmer Rouge guys, dark skin, which is typically the, you know,

589
01:04:44.20 --> 01:04:51.56
the Khmer Rouge guys are more peasant areas. And, and they block them off and they all have AKs old

590
01:04:51.56 --> 01:04:59.08
banged up AKs. And they walk up and the lead punk and the lead cop go nose to nose and the

591
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:05.48
car and the punks going, and you see, and I'm on a balcony second floor right above it. And,

592
01:05:06.92 --> 01:05:13.56
and the, and the lead cop plays really passive. Oh yeah. Okay, man, I'm sorry. And he, and he

593
01:05:13.56 --> 01:05:20.52
wheels around, takes two steps back, nods to his guys, whips it around from the hip. They all open

594
01:05:20.52 --> 01:05:30.36
up 30 round magazines, foot over the heads of the, of the mob, reload those guys, leave their bikes,

595
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.68
run each other over, it turns into complete Keystone cops. They turn into the biggest bunch

596
01:05:36.68 --> 01:05:41.80
of cowards you've ever seen in your life. And then I went out on the balcony and started clapping.

597
01:05:41.80 --> 01:05:51.48
And, you know, but yeah, and I just, I think, yeah, it was had a profound impact on, you know,

598
01:05:51.48 --> 01:05:56.60
on the mob and the cowardice of the mob when someone has the courage to stand up to the mob.

599
01:05:57.32 --> 01:06:02.52
What was the initial thread that you caught onto for going to Cambodia?

600
01:06:02.52 --> 01:06:12.84
Uh, was in my mind, this was the worst unaccounted for atrocity since World War Two.

601
01:06:13.40 --> 01:06:20.36
This was the event that, that destroyed the never again promise that made the whole never again,

602
01:06:21.08 --> 01:06:28.20
we're not going to be bystanders to genocide, mythical. And, and I said, how and why did this

603
01:06:28.20 --> 01:06:34.12
happen? And that's what made me go. That's why I wanted to start there. Then Bosnia happened.

604
01:06:34.12 --> 01:06:40.36
And then I'm in the foreign correspondence club watching Rwanda and Rwanda is just on a magnitude

605
01:06:40.36 --> 01:06:46.76
that, you know, is like Cambodia. And so these things are flaring up all around us. The UN sending

606
01:06:47.56 --> 01:06:53.16
forces doing the same bullshit neutrality thing. You had the French foreign legion in Cambodia,

607
01:06:53.16 --> 01:07:00.20
generals, Laurie Dan and redo said unleashes war is our business. We'll go fight these guys and

608
01:07:00.20 --> 01:07:06.20
they wouldn't take them off the leash. And both, both generals resigned. You had the Aussie SAS,

609
01:07:06.20 --> 01:07:12.76
you had real serious guys, but they'd send the Bulgarians. They'd send, you know, I mean, the

610
01:07:12.76 --> 01:07:19.48
the most lasting legacy of the UN in Cambodia was eight because they took soldiers from all over the

611
01:07:19.48 --> 01:07:25.40
world, put them all over the country. And that was their mode and UN land cruisers that the Khmer Rouge

612
01:07:25.40 --> 01:07:31.88
all stole. And they would just steal them at gunpoint. And one of the guys that I hired a ex

613
01:07:31.88 --> 01:07:37.64
Khmer Rouge guy, he would then sell them back to the UN. He would be the negotiator for them to buy

614
01:07:37.64 --> 01:07:44.28
back their own cars. And it was just weakness upon weakness. Yeah, you say in facing death in

615
01:07:44.28 --> 01:07:48.04
Cambodia, your book, you say, I began research, I began the research that would make this book

616
01:07:48.04 --> 01:07:52.76
possible in 1993. I was completing my PhD dissertation at Columbia University on the Nuremberg

617
01:07:52.76 --> 01:07:57.72
war crime trials and laws of war. The dissertation was awarded honors, but it was cold comfort.

618
01:07:58.28 --> 01:08:04.04
I felt hollow and fraudulent like a boxing commentator who had never been in the ring.

619
01:08:04.04 --> 01:08:10.12
I was writing about modern conflict as a civilian leading a secure life and an Ivy League university

620
01:08:10.68 --> 01:08:17.000
28 and a product of one of the softest generations in American history. What did I know about conflict

621
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.76
resolution, resolution beyond what I had read to teach undergraduates about how the world should be

622
01:08:22.76 --> 01:08:28.76
without addressing the rapidity changing the rapidly changing world on its own terms was to

623
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:36.76
perpetuate a familiar cycle of fraudulence. So you were going to go get in it. Yeah.

624
01:08:38.92 --> 01:08:44.60
Then so so as Campbell, the first time you went to Cambodia, like how much intel did you gather

625
01:08:44.60 --> 01:08:54.52
the first time you went there? I saw that it was that the UN had done nothing about accountability.

626
01:08:54.52 --> 01:09:01.40
I saw that the the evidence of war crimes and genocide and all that was in the wind that,

627
01:09:01.40 --> 01:09:07.64
you know, I mean, we're finding stuff, you know, from third parties. I got a bunch of material

628
01:09:07.64 --> 01:09:15.48
in East Germany because the East Germans came in with the Vietnamese military. So there was no kind

629
01:09:15.48 --> 01:09:21.96
of it was catch as catch can. So my main imperative initially was to preserve the historical evidence.

630
01:09:21.96 --> 01:09:26.84
And I was a historian with a background in war crimes. And so, you know, when I went to Telfer

631
01:09:26.84 --> 01:09:31.96
Taylor and said, who do you think I should do this? He looked at me like, were you, you know,

632
01:09:31.96 --> 01:09:37.32
are you stupid? What did you study all this stuff for? And my grandfather, when I went the pilot,

633
01:09:37.32 --> 01:09:41.96
when I went to tell him, hey, I'm going to go to Cambodia, you know, he said, yeah, great,

634
01:09:41.96 --> 01:09:50.36
don't be careful, careful kills. And so nobody in my family thought it was the least bit strange,

635
01:09:50.36 --> 01:09:58.36
you know, so that, you know, my dad's half sister, Marty Hoy would have been the first

636
01:09:58.36 --> 01:10:04.76
woman to climb Everest, I think in 82. And her waist belt ended and she fell 5000 vertical feet,

637
01:10:04.76 --> 01:10:10.12
and they never found her body. And she was probably the greatest female mountain climber of all time.

638
01:10:10.12 --> 01:10:19.16
My uncle sailed like a 29 foot boat from Ventura Harbor to the Marquesas and spent like six years

639
01:10:19.16 --> 01:10:25.08
sailing around the world. So we get it honest, you know. And so I don't know, you know, it's just

640
01:10:25.72 --> 01:10:33.40
as normal. Now at some point, you know, when you're working the Cambodia case, you start

641
01:10:33.40 --> 01:10:38.36
pulling the thread on James Clark, Lance McNamara, Mike Deeds, and Crystal Lance. Yeah.

642
01:10:39.56 --> 01:10:46.60
And that's tell us about those guys. Well, I had friends from the marijuana trade who said, hey,

643
01:10:47.56 --> 01:10:53.88
these guys we knew vanished in Cambodia. And we never we don't know what happened, see if you

644
01:10:53.88 --> 01:11:03.08
can find any records, see if you can find anything about them. And, and I found one of their pictures

645
01:11:03.08 --> 01:11:09.72
in the prison, white guy, you know, surfer. And, and that was, you know, that was something I could

646
01:11:09.72 --> 01:11:14.52
identify with had I been 10 years older, it could have been me, I would have probably done that at

647
01:11:14.52 --> 01:11:23.32
that time. So that and then I met the families, you know, and, and that, I think, and that's the

648
01:11:23.32 --> 01:11:27.32
thing also that leads us into the Miag was I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but

649
01:11:27.32 --> 01:11:35.56
nothing is more damaging and traumatizing to a family than having a family member disappear

650
01:11:36.12 --> 01:11:45.24
and not knowing how, what, when, and not being able to tie that up and to see the the trauma that

651
01:11:45.24 --> 01:11:52.44
the family goes through as a result, alcoholism, suicide, all those kind of things, you know, really

652
01:11:52.44 --> 01:11:57.96
followed a lot of the Westerners who were captured by the Khmer Rouge. How were these guys rolled

653
01:11:57.96 --> 01:12:06.36
up initially? Sailboat just got too close. And those disputed islands off of Cambodia, the Vietnamese

654
01:12:06.36 --> 01:12:12.04
and Cambodians were always fighting over. So they had Pete, they had fat American fast boats, they

655
01:12:12.04 --> 01:12:19.88
had armed fishing boats. So they were patrolling that stretch of water and, and, and very vigilant

656
01:12:19.88 --> 01:12:28.28
about it. And so, um, yeah, so that that was it. And they just, you know, got it got their boats,

657
01:12:28.84 --> 01:12:33.96
took them in, took them to Toul Slang prison, interrogated and tortured them for, you know,

658
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:42.44
gosh, the last two who died, you know, there was days before the Vietnamese liberated Cambodia. So,

659
01:12:43.08 --> 01:12:48.04
you know, but they were three months or something, you know, just horrible tortures and, and

660
01:12:48.04 --> 01:12:54.36
and rewriting their confessions over and over and over and long 30, 40, 50 page confessions.

661
01:12:55.64 --> 01:13:01.56
And, you know, and, and that's the thing. And that's, you know, you see that at, at a certain

662
01:13:01.56 --> 01:13:10.52
point with torture, it doesn't work. So, well, it's crazy that the, that the Khmer Rouge decided

663
01:13:10.52 --> 01:13:16.28
to photograph everyone before they tortured and killed them. Yeah. Did you ever, what compelled

664
01:13:16.28 --> 01:13:24.12
them to do that? They were so paranoid that they had to prove to the leadership that they were

665
01:13:24.12 --> 01:13:29.16
carrying out their orders. And the remarkable thing about that prison is there were roughly like

666
01:13:29.72 --> 01:13:39.08
1200 guards and staff members, something like 500 of them wound up as prisoners. One guy screamed,

667
01:13:39.08 --> 01:13:46.76
had a bad dream in the night and screamed, you're a CIA. One guy broke an axe handle, you're KGB. I mean,

668
01:13:47.56 --> 01:13:54.60
you know, this is Stone Age communism. And basically, they're all spying on each other,

669
01:13:54.60 --> 01:14:01.64
they're all snitching on each other. They would have these meetings. And, and one guy I interviewed

670
01:14:01.64 --> 01:14:08.68
was one of the head executioners named Him Hoi. And I was prepared to meet evil incarnate. And he

671
01:14:08.68 --> 01:14:14.60
was rumored to have killed thousands with the, with the ox cart axle to the back of the neck.

672
01:14:14.60 --> 01:14:21.96
And so I said, you know, I've been interviewing him and a couple of Marlboro Reds and Tiger beers,

673
01:14:21.96 --> 01:14:27.40
always kind of loosened him up a little bit. And he said, you know, I said, how did you,

674
01:14:27.40 --> 01:14:32.44
how did you get it to a sling prison? He said, well, I, they showed up in my village, you know,

675
01:14:32.44 --> 01:14:39.16
and you were drafted at gunpoint. And I ran away. And then I, they came back to my village. I ran

676
01:14:39.16 --> 01:14:45.08
away again. And the second time they sent me to the front. And my first battle, I was shot in the

677
01:14:45.08 --> 01:14:50.44
head. And they said, Oh, you're going to die so over the top, you lead the charge, you get shot a

678
01:14:50.44 --> 01:14:59.000
bunch more times. He recovers from that. And then during the invasion of Peno Pente, he gets a grenade

679
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.88
dropped on him. And I say, wow, you know, were you afraid you were going to die? He goes, no, I was

680
01:15:03.88 --> 01:15:08.68
afraid that I was going to get captured. And they were going to eat my liver in front of me. So he

681
01:15:08.68 --> 01:15:15.24
crawls under a house survives that. And they say, Oh, comrade, hoy, you're such a valiant warrior,

682
01:15:15.24 --> 01:15:21.16
we have a special job for you. And they send him to a sling. So he starts out as a low level guard.

683
01:15:21.80 --> 01:15:28.92
Then his boss is accused. He becomes a prisoner. He moves up the food chain. And so his superior

684
01:15:28.92 --> 01:15:33.64
is keep getting killed. So suddenly he's one of the head guards, he's driving the truck to the

685
01:15:33.64 --> 01:15:39.48
killing fields at Chiang Ak. And, you know, and I said something to the effect of like, do you

686
01:15:39.48 --> 01:15:44.44
feel bad about it? Or some stupid question like that? And he just looked at me goes, it was death

687
01:15:44.44 --> 01:15:55.48
either way. And, and, you know, and it was remarkable in that he his whole life now is about

688
01:15:55.48 --> 01:16:00.60
penance. And, you know, because I would say that these guys like, Oh, do you think it's important

689
01:16:00.60 --> 01:16:06.12
that Pol Pot has tried and we hold them accountable and all this rah, rah, Western human rights

690
01:16:06.12 --> 01:16:12.04
bullshit. And they would say, No, not really at all. I think they should dig a big hole and bury

691
01:16:12.04 --> 01:16:17.32
all of it. Because vengeance breeds vengeance. And that's very Buddhist, right? But then they would

692
01:16:17.32 --> 01:16:23.56
say, What does it matter? He's 70 years old. He's only going to live 10 more years. He's coming back

693
01:16:23.56 --> 01:16:31.32
for 15,000 lives as a cockroach. So he's going to get his. So their thing is you're reincarnated as

694
01:16:32.28 --> 01:16:39.96
the lowliest horrible creature on earth for the next 10,000 years. So anything we can do

695
01:16:39.96 --> 01:16:47.08
in our earthly timeframe is immaterial to them. So that was interesting, you know, that really,

696
01:16:47.08 --> 01:16:57.000
and that the guy who probably had a bigger, more profound effect on me was one of the survivors,

697
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.80
a guy named Imchaun. They kept him alive because he could have carved effigies of Pol Pot.

698
01:17:02.36 --> 01:17:05.56
Sure. He was a good artist. Yeah, he was a good artist. Figured out that he was a good artist.

699
01:17:05.56 --> 01:17:12.20
Yeah. And, and I same thing, first trip, Oh, isn't this great? Never again. We're going to get you

700
01:17:12.20 --> 01:17:19.32
justice and, and, and he kind of, and he cracked and he said, You know what? I'm only talking to you

701
01:17:19.32 --> 01:17:26.60
because the museum director told me to and I don't like talking to you guys. And every time I talk to

702
01:17:26.60 --> 01:17:34.04
you, you shorten my life. I think that they should take all this crap and dig a big hole and bury

703
01:17:34.04 --> 01:17:40.20
it and tear down this prison because vengeance reads vengeance. And then I turned off my tape

704
01:17:40.20 --> 01:17:47.24
recorder said, Okay, see you later. And I could have easily spun that and gone, you know, never

705
01:17:47.24 --> 01:17:56.20
again, rah, rah, rah, and gotten a big check from George Soros. But I really, it put me on my heels.

706
01:17:56.20 --> 01:18:02.68
And I thought, what cold comfort that we're, we're going to come in like the white nights

707
01:18:02.68 --> 01:18:08.76
after the genocide and hold a couple old guys up accountable. And at this time, you've got Rwanda

708
01:18:08.76 --> 01:18:15.48
going on, you've got Bosnia going on. I mean, during the former Yugoslavia war, they're indicting

709
01:18:15.48 --> 01:18:21.32
people with an ongoing conflict where there's massive atrocities being carried out and they're

710
01:18:21.32 --> 01:18:27.64
not even doing anything Rwanda the same East Timor. And these are just blowing up all over the

711
01:18:27.64 --> 01:18:33.80
place and the UN's taking this very passive, you know, non interventionist, even when they have

712
01:18:33.80 --> 01:18:41.40
forces on the ground, they don't take them off the leash. And so the whole thing seemed very

713
01:18:41.40 --> 01:18:47.24
fraudulent to me. I went to the Hague a couple of times and, you know, and you know, again,

714
01:18:47.24 --> 01:18:53.32
I call it the human rights industry. It's an industry. And when I started in the whole war

715
01:18:53.32 --> 01:18:59.32
crimes thing, I was one of about three people, nobody was in this field. And then it becomes

716
01:18:59.32 --> 01:19:05.56
this booming industry with the Hague with all these institutes and places at different universities.

717
01:19:06.52 --> 01:19:11.72
And I've worked on a lot of these high profile cases because I have subject matter expertise,

718
01:19:12.28 --> 01:19:20.28
but I can't take money or I'm a partisan. So I've walked a strange line in my career, you know,

719
01:19:21.72 --> 01:19:26.36
where, you know, I worked on the Jose Padilla, the dirty bomber case, I worked on the David Irving

720
01:19:26.36 --> 01:19:33.56
case, I worked in the Cameroon case. And, you know, and I sort of, you know, run afoul of everyone

721
01:19:33.56 --> 01:19:39.24
over the years. And it's funny because books are like children. They make their own friends.

722
01:19:39.80 --> 01:19:44.60
So I thought, oh, the New York Times, the polite society, they're going to all love me.

723
01:19:44.60 --> 01:19:53.80
No, they hated me. And, and it was the professional military and the far left became my best

724
01:19:53.80 --> 01:19:56.92
constituents, you know, and my first book, how was that?

725
01:19:59.08 --> 01:20:03.08
I, you'd have to ask them, this is this is Lawn War. You're telling me your first book.

726
01:20:03.08 --> 01:20:08.84
Yeah, Lawn War is an interesting book because that took me 10 years to get published. And

727
01:20:09.48 --> 01:20:16.12
it got rejected by a lot of publishers. And I would get they take your book, they send it out to

728
01:20:16.12 --> 01:20:21.32
the experts in the field. And I would always get one really good review, and then one really bad

729
01:20:21.32 --> 01:20:28.04
review, because basically I said, Nuremberg trials, if anything drew the Germans together

730
01:20:28.92 --> 01:20:34.76
in their defense of the Third Reich, it was the Marshall plan, it was economic prosperity.

731
01:20:34.76 --> 01:20:40.20
That's what converted them to see the era of the Third Reich. And the era of the Third Reich,

732
01:20:40.20 --> 01:20:47.24
the key players are the children of the people who lived through the Third Reich, the 68er generation

733
01:20:47.24 --> 01:20:53.08
comes of age and say, Dad, what did you do in the war? So that was you say the 68 or January?

734
01:20:53.08 --> 01:21:00.76
Yeah, the 68ers is, you know, like 68 was a big year of, of strife in the United States.

735
01:21:00.76 --> 01:21:05.08
Oh, so people that were born in 19, yeah, like the kind of lefties of, yeah. And so

736
01:21:05.88 --> 01:21:12.28
that generation, that's when that society began to reckon with its past. It was not in the 50s.

737
01:21:12.28 --> 01:21:21.000
So that was a very unwelcome message. But then a German historian, a guy by the name of Juerg

738
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.52
Friedrich, he was one of my reviewers. And he said, Oh, yeah, of course, we all know this, this

739
01:21:26.52 --> 01:21:32.52
should be published, blah, blah, blah. And then my second guy sent me the most scathing criticism

740
01:21:32.52 --> 01:21:38.84
of anything I've ever written. And I, I, and Friedrich called me, huh, McGuire, oh, great job,

741
01:21:38.84 --> 01:21:44.04
blah, blah, I said, it's done. I'm they, I didn't get the contract. He said, what? And he sent,

742
01:21:44.04 --> 01:21:49.72
he said, send me the guy's review. So then he went through the guy's review and ripped it apart

743
01:21:49.72 --> 01:21:57.56
and got me hired by Spiegel TV in Germany. So then he introduced me to ad now ours, war crimes,

744
01:21:57.56 --> 01:22:04.92
advisors, the German defense attorneys, Flohten Richter, Otto Kronzbühler, who was

745
01:22:04.92 --> 01:22:12.28
doonits and crops defense attorney. And this guy was ad now ours, special, you know, advisor on

746
01:22:12.28 --> 01:22:19.72
the war crime stuff. So in the treaty, restoring German sovereignty in the 50s, where they're kind

747
01:22:19.72 --> 01:22:27.80
of let off probation in this gigantic thousands of page treaty, he inserts these paragraphs

748
01:22:27.80 --> 01:22:35.32
that invalidate all the post war war crimes trial decisions, the legal validity is rejected. And,

749
01:22:35.88 --> 01:22:41.40
and I would know one would ever found it out. But he said, look, I wrote it in invisible ink.

750
01:22:41.96 --> 01:22:47.72
I put the exception before the rule. No good lawyer would ever do that. And so that's,

751
01:22:48.44 --> 01:22:55.72
I had that in my book. And that was not happily received. So yeah, so I was, so that was a difficult,

752
01:22:55.72 --> 01:23:00.68
you know, 10 years knowing that you're right, but you got to fight and fight and fight.

753
01:23:02.04 --> 01:23:07.32
And then the book got published. And yes, that's the book that the military liked in the left

754
01:23:07.32 --> 01:23:13.24
like, but the polite society sure didn't like it. But they didn't, they couldn't really come after me

755
01:23:13.24 --> 01:23:20.04
because they hadn't done the heavy lifting. Like I said, their analysis of the Nuremberg trials

756
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:26.60
never went deeper than Robert Jackson's opening address. It's this mythic myth of Nuremberg

757
01:23:26.60 --> 01:23:34.68
as this redemptive thing. And so yeah. And then what about what about death facing death in Cambodia?

758
01:23:34.68 --> 01:23:40.12
So that one get received? Pretty well, actually. Yeah, that one, that one I did better. But still,

759
01:23:40.12 --> 01:23:47.96
it and I mean, is the end what's your takeaway from, you know, vengeance breeds vendors? Is that

760
01:23:47.96 --> 01:23:53.64
your takeaway from that whole thing? Hey, bury this stuff in a hole and let's move on. No,

761
01:23:53.64 --> 01:24:00.60
definitely not. But I think what, what really came home for me was that you have to talk to the

762
01:24:00.60 --> 01:24:08.12
culture that, that survived this, that endured this, you can't come from the high and parachute

763
01:24:08.12 --> 01:24:14.20
down from the Hague. And that's what they did in Cambodia. And so when they finally, you know,

764
01:24:14.20 --> 01:24:24.04
they, they took more time to try for 80 year old Khmer Rouge leaders than it took to try thousands

765
01:24:24.04 --> 01:24:30.04
of war criminals after World War Two. And, and you know, I don't know how many millions they spent,

766
01:24:30.04 --> 01:24:35.32
the numbers are impossible to tell. And, and they got involved in what I call therapeutic

767
01:24:35.32 --> 01:24:43.24
legalism, which is we need closure and healing. And, and you can't ask a court to do that. And

768
01:24:43.24 --> 01:24:48.44
then they point to Nuremberg and say, look, look, Nuremberg did that, which is a myth. And so

769
01:24:49.64 --> 01:24:55.64
to ask a court to do anything more than punish the guilty and exonerate the innocent is too much.

770
01:24:55.64 --> 01:25:03.16
And so all of this, you know, therapeutic legalism and you burden it with, with victims units and

771
01:25:03.16 --> 01:25:10.28
all this kind of emotional stuff. And that's the world we live in now where, you know, this, these

772
01:25:10.28 --> 01:25:20.60
notions of comfort and safety. And I, I have a very kind of different view of it. And I believe

773
01:25:20.60 --> 01:25:28.28
that, that freedom isn't safe, you know, the lambs freedom safe, if you want this kind of timid,

774
01:25:28.28 --> 01:25:34.52
little bleeding freedom. But the lion's freedom is a bold thing. And if the lion breaks its leg,

775
01:25:34.52 --> 01:25:40.36
the hyenas get it. And that's the game, you know, so you don't get it both ways. And I don't, and I'm

776
01:25:40.36 --> 01:25:45.40
very uncomfortable with the direction American society is going now with, you know, this note,

777
01:25:45.40 --> 01:25:51.24
and that's why I don't teach anymore. Because, and I love teaching, it was very fun. But it turned

778
01:25:51.24 --> 01:25:57.24
into this notions of, Oh, well, you know, you know, I don't feel safe, I don't feel comfortable,

779
01:25:57.24 --> 01:26:03.80
I can't teach the Holocaust and Khmer Rouge, and you be comfortable. What is that? So I'm very

780
01:26:03.80 --> 01:26:10.12
socratic in the way I taught in that, you know, you don't raise your hand, I call on you. And,

781
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.20
and you know, and that's keep some reading and keeps them on their toes. And I would walk in

782
01:26:16.76 --> 01:26:23.56
when I taught at Columbia with three by five cards. And I'd say, okay, take one, pass it down,

783
01:26:23.56 --> 01:26:28.92
and they kind of be giggling. And then I'd say, fold it in half. And they go, Oh, arts and crafts,

784
01:26:28.92 --> 01:26:33.80
I go write your name on it, I can't be bothered to remember your name. Smith, why are you here?

785
01:26:35.72 --> 01:26:42.76
Smith stock tips, sports scores, talk, and just boom, fast and make them all talk. And just like

786
01:26:42.76 --> 01:26:50.04
you dealt with in buds, by the end of that first class, they were bound together as a unit in terror.

787
01:26:50.04 --> 01:26:59.16
And, and then, and then, you know, but then once that class was over, they go, Professor

788
01:26:59.16 --> 01:27:05.32
McGuire, I go, No, it's Peter said, that was a fucking show. I said, you call on me anytime you

789
01:27:05.32 --> 01:27:11.40
need a letter of recommendation, anything, you know, you survive, man, I'm yours for the rest of

790
01:27:11.40 --> 01:27:17.40
your life. And, and I'm still in touch with a lot of those students, and they've done incredibly

791
01:27:17.40 --> 01:27:22.52
well. And I also also taught jujitsu while I taught history. And I'd say any of you don't

792
01:27:22.52 --> 01:27:27.64
like your grade, you can come to the jujitsu class and you can settle it with me on the mat. How's

793
01:27:27.64 --> 01:27:39.32
that sound? Hey, when you look at the Cameroon in Cambodia, when you look at the Nazis, Nazis had

794
01:27:39.32 --> 01:27:46.36
like a ramp up period, you know, it took 1933, you could see it brewing, there was this sort of

795
01:27:46.36 --> 01:27:58.52
slower boil as the things started to transform. But the Cameroon was like, overnight madness.

796
01:27:59.56 --> 01:28:07.88
And madness at a level that's it's it's it's it's actual insanity. Well, it was class resentment

797
01:28:07.88 --> 01:28:15.80
that was stoked. And so you had an incredibly corrupt, you had the crazy King Sienaq, who was,

798
01:28:15.80 --> 01:28:24.36
you know, just this kind of wild playboy, and incredible decadent corruption of the elites,

799
01:28:25.64 --> 01:28:32.36
and the peasantry resenting them already, leading really hard lives. You know, when you go up in

800
01:28:32.36 --> 01:28:40.76
the Cambodian provinces, a day seems like a week, and it's hot, and it's just it's a hard, hard life.

801
01:28:40.76 --> 01:28:49.40
And and so, you know, they're seeing these very westernized, you know, decadent elites in the city,

802
01:28:49.40 --> 01:28:57.48
and then you have pulpotting, serice, cusampon, and these are all Sorbonne educated. So and they

803
01:28:57.48 --> 01:29:05.80
bring the latest trendy Marxist theories, and, and particularly Mao, and, and the cultural revolution

804
01:29:05.80 --> 01:29:15.48
becomes, you know, the model. And they want the blank slate clean peasants year zero. Yeah, they want

805
01:29:15.48 --> 01:29:23.64
people, you know, most of the elites were, you know, real, you know, peasants with, you know, no

806
01:29:23.64 --> 01:29:30.60
education, nothing. And they would get them away from their parents and reshape them. And, and,

807
01:29:30.60 --> 01:29:36.04
and that's what they did. And they did very quickly. And they did it with great Chinese support,

808
01:29:36.04 --> 01:29:42.76
and denial on the Western left, who were, who were, you know, no Chomsky in particular,

809
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:49.88
that, you know, would deny the atrocities and cast a shadow of doubt over what was going on when it

810
01:29:49.88 --> 01:29:56.28
was pretty clear what was going on. And then it was a very shameful period. And then it was

811
01:29:56.28 --> 01:30:03.000
shameful afterwards when everybody knew and propped them up in the name of Cold War geopolitics. And so

812
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.72
yeah, and then I mean, so you have in, you know, in 79, you have the Vietnamese knock out the

813
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:18.68
Khmer Rouge, then the Chinese knock take a run at the Vietnamese and they have a nasty little,

814
01:30:18.68 --> 01:30:24.12
you know, border war for a minute there. And then they come to a truce. And basically the Chinese

815
01:30:24.12 --> 01:30:31.72
are like, you're not to talk about the genocide. Okay. And, and they gave the they did a lot better

816
01:30:31.72 --> 01:30:38.44
than people thought they would the Vietnamese Vietnamese are pretty fierce. And, and so,

817
01:30:39.32 --> 01:30:44.92
yeah. And so that that was that was how those, you know, those Cold War geopolitics, you know,

818
01:30:44.92 --> 01:30:52.84
shape things up. All right. So when did when did when did facing death in Cambodia actually come

819
01:30:52.84 --> 01:30:58.20
out 2005? Oh, so you were working on that for you're working on that book for 10 years, 10 years

820
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:05.40
usually. You're not you're not a fast writer. No, no, I'm very fast. But I had to let the events

821
01:31:05.40 --> 01:31:13.000
play out Hickson's book took me six months. Okay. So so that means where were you you were in

822
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:22.04
Cambodia when 911 happened? I was. And how what was that like? It was surreal. My buddy Luke Hunt

823
01:31:22.04 --> 01:31:29.24
who had just come from Afghanistan and I think he had interviewed Mullah Omar. And we were at the

824
01:31:29.24 --> 01:31:35.64
foreign correspondence club. It was late. And, and he could he's Aussie and he runs up the stairs

825
01:31:35.64 --> 01:31:41.56
World War three started World War three started. And I was like, I'll get out of here. And, and I

826
01:31:41.56 --> 01:31:48.60
was kind of in denial. And I said, Oh, you know, it's just I'm drunk and a Cessna. And so I had a

827
01:31:48.60 --> 01:31:54.04
room I would keep at the foreign correspondence club. So me and another reporter and Luke went down

828
01:31:54.60 --> 01:31:59.72
and we're drinking beer and watching the thing and all of a sudden the second plane flew in.

829
01:31:59.72 --> 01:32:08.84
And I went, What the fuck? And then then the only thing I was right about was when all of a sudden

830
01:32:08.84 --> 01:32:14.92
the whole screen went gray. And I was like, it pancaked. And I knew that from construction

831
01:32:14.92 --> 01:32:20.84
because I'd seen controlled I'd seen buildings collapse and things like that. Because, you know,

832
01:32:20.84 --> 01:32:27.56
I've been around construction my whole life. And so that that's when I got real. My wife was in

833
01:32:27.56 --> 01:32:34.28
New York City. And so it was impossible to get in touch with her. And we were on the Upper West

834
01:32:34.28 --> 01:32:41.48
Side. So we weren't quite near it. But yeah, that was then I took me a long time to get back. And I

835
01:32:41.48 --> 01:32:53.48
was stuck over there. And yeah, it was it was surreal. Okay. And so this book comes out 2005,

836
01:32:53.48 --> 01:33:02.04
Facing Death in Cambodia, that's received better than Lawnmower. Yeah. And then in the meantime,

837
01:33:02.04 --> 01:33:09.40
you're working on this on the Greeno advanced rescue craft. Yes. So George Greeno, who's like a

838
01:33:09.40 --> 01:33:19.16
legendary kind of iconic surf surfer, shaper, he's kind of credited for the modern surfing fin.

839
01:33:19.16 --> 01:33:25.48
Yeah. How did you how did you know him? When I lived in Australia. And then that's right,

840
01:33:25.48 --> 01:33:33.56
you live the next door neighbor. Yeah. And then I would come often from Cambodia to Australia.

841
01:33:33.56 --> 01:33:43.08
And so it was like the cute the PTSD cure was being afraid of getting eaten by I mean getting,

842
01:33:43.64 --> 01:33:48.20
you know, killed by the Cameroon. And then you go surf these outer reefs with George Greeno and

843
01:33:48.20 --> 01:33:54.44
have to worry about getting eaten by great light sharks. And there were so many sharks there at

844
01:33:54.44 --> 01:34:00.04
that. And they still are it's actually much worse now. And then and I had grown up on boats and George

845
01:34:00.04 --> 01:34:07.24
always had these incredible skiffs. And he had won a 12 foot boat. He's an amazing fisherman. He

846
01:34:07.24 --> 01:34:16.52
caught a 12 foot and a 13 foot tiger shark on hand lines off his 12 foot boat, cut both heads off

847
01:34:16.52 --> 01:34:22.84
with a serrated bread knife, brought them both in. And you know, before it was before sharks

848
01:34:22.84 --> 01:34:28.28
became the new dolphin, we regularly fished for sharks and didn't feel really bad about it. But

849
01:34:28.28 --> 01:34:36.20
but anyway, so I fished with George a fair bit. And and I was living on the North Shore. I had

850
01:34:36.20 --> 01:34:44.52
been a lifeguard and I was having to make a lot of rescues in Moklaia. And the North Shore guy who

851
01:34:44.52 --> 01:34:51.08
does all the sleds and rescue stuff taught me how to drive a jet ski. And I was like, these things

852
01:34:51.08 --> 01:34:56.60
suck. And then I had friends in the teams and they were telling me about all you got to do is make

853
01:34:56.60 --> 01:35:02.44
this one Yamaha SUV that we want because it's stable, just splash a mold off it. And of course,

854
01:35:02.44 --> 01:35:07.08
that would have been too easy. I don't do anything easy. I always have to reinvent the wheel. So I

855
01:35:07.08 --> 01:35:12.04
called George, hey, George, you still got the mold for the 12 footer. Yeah, I do. Okay, let's let's

856
01:35:12.04 --> 01:35:21.48
make a jet boat. And so in the dirt under George's house, me and my old right hand man from Cambodia,

857
01:35:21.48 --> 01:35:27.80
cut the jet ski up and married it to his 12 footer. And the first one came out of the mold.

858
01:35:27.80 --> 01:35:40.84
Perfect. And then we canceled, we canceled a military program. And that really, I didn't

859
01:35:40.84 --> 01:35:47.32
understand military contracting, things like that. And then then we were a big threat and military

860
01:35:47.32 --> 01:35:53.08
military industrial complex stuff. And, and it wasn't fun anymore. The military industrial

861
01:35:53.08 --> 01:35:59.56
conference will, will eat you alive. Yeah. And Ivan was a great ally. And we, the teams loved the

862
01:35:59.56 --> 01:36:06.28
boat. The PJs actually became our best, our best clients, because it was, you know, C 130 dropable.

863
01:36:06.28 --> 01:36:11.32
So did you actually start manufacturing them? Oh, yeah, yeah, we sold, I think about 30 to the PJs.

864
01:36:11.32 --> 01:36:16.92
But then they made us, they didn't let us cut up Yamaha jet skis anymore that were perfect

865
01:36:16.92 --> 01:36:23.32
with perfect wiring harnesses and gauges and all that. So we had to cob and a crappy engine that

866
01:36:23.32 --> 01:36:28.84
they made us use and wiring harnesses and steering and all that. And just it was like death by 1000

867
01:36:28.84 --> 01:36:37.32
cuts with NAVC engineers. And, and it was no longer fun at all. But, but I managed to get through it

868
01:36:37.32 --> 01:36:43.64
and came in on time and on budget and delivered the boats and then sold my company to a company

869
01:36:43.64 --> 01:36:50.60
called Maritime Applied Physics. And now it's probably the best unmanned craft out there.

870
01:36:50.60 --> 01:36:57.08
And it's got a Volvo Penta and it's super badass. It goes like 50 knots. Now was it, was the James

871
01:36:57.08 --> 01:37:04.68
Clark Lance McNair, Mike Deeds, Crystal Lance, those guys, those surfers, guys that were captured

872
01:37:04.68 --> 01:37:11.08
off of Cambodia and imprisoned and killed. Was that sort of the first thing that, that,

873
01:37:11.08 --> 01:37:17.24
that the thread that led you to writing tie stick? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And so I found out about

874
01:37:17.24 --> 01:37:24.04
that and I got more information. And I was at Scorpion Bay and which is kind of like a, you

875
01:37:24.04 --> 01:37:31.88
know, a smuggler's retirement home now. And, and, and it was unbelievable. Oh, yeah, I knew them.

876
01:37:31.88 --> 01:37:35.96
And, you know, all these people, I knew them, I knew them. And then they kept saying, you need to talk

877
01:37:35.96 --> 01:37:40.92
to Mike Ritter, you need to talk to Mike Ritter, you need to talk to Mike Ritter. And then they

878
01:37:40.92 --> 01:37:48.44
and, and I finally met Mike Ritter and he had been a big smuggler in Thailand. And what he didn't

879
01:37:48.44 --> 01:37:54.76
tell me was that he had been contracted to supply their load. And so he, so he had been

880
01:37:55.32 --> 01:38:03.000
contracted to bring them their load of pot from Thailand. Yeah, from Trot. So those guys were on

881
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.20
a boat sailing to Thailand. Yeah, they were going to link up. Yeah. And Mike Ritter was going to give

882
01:38:08.20 --> 01:38:13.24
them a load of pot to bring wherever, try back in the States. Yeah. And Ritter was a surfer from Santa

883
01:38:13.24 --> 01:38:20.76
Barbara. And he would go on a Thai fishing boat with, you know, usually no compass. They'd give

884
01:38:20.76 --> 01:38:25.24
them the crappiest boat they had because they didn't want to get it seized. And he'd have one of those

885
01:38:25.24 --> 01:38:31.32
truffle log spinners and, you know, just old fashioned navigating. And he'd bring the pot out.

886
01:38:31.32 --> 01:38:38.52
And, you know, pirates and I mean, that's that period of time is the worst period of piracy in

887
01:38:38.52 --> 01:38:43.48
world history. This is what years? This is in the 70s. late 70s. Yeah. So, well mid to late 70s.

888
01:38:43.48 --> 01:38:51.08
Yeah. Vietnam falls in 75. So you have all those Vietnamese going out to sea with all their worldly

889
01:38:51.08 --> 01:38:57.16
possessions, usually in women's jewelry. That's how they carry their wealth. So you had the most

890
01:38:57.16 --> 01:39:03.24
feral brutal pirates you could ever imagine. So that was a very dangerous piece of water. And

891
01:39:04.28 --> 01:39:09.24
and so that's what Ritter was doing for for many, many years and living in Thailand. And

892
01:39:09.80 --> 01:39:15.64
he was one of the first guys to surf Grodjigan, one of the first guys to surf Bali. So you had a

893
01:39:15.64 --> 01:39:22.84
bunch of smugglers in Bali in the off season. And basically Grodjigan was founded by pot smugglers.

894
01:39:22.84 --> 01:39:29.08
And so they were the ones who really were the first to really kind of explore the Indonesian

895
01:39:29.08 --> 01:39:35.96
archipelago. And and that was, you know, Ritter was one of them. And so then I trained him as a

896
01:39:35.96 --> 01:39:44.12
historian. And then he started interviewing his sources of old retired smugglers. And we made

897
01:39:44.12 --> 01:39:49.08
sure we interviewed people who had been busted. So there was at that time no double jeopardy.

898
01:39:49.08 --> 01:39:56.04
And then things got a little wobbly after 9 11. And and and then I was going to find the old

899
01:39:56.04 --> 01:40:01.48
Khmer Rouge guys and, you know, different, you know, people on that side, law enforcement,

900
01:40:01.48 --> 01:40:07.88
confidential informants. There were a lot of old US intelligence guys involved because, you know,

901
01:40:07.88 --> 01:40:14.20
they had they had the knowledge of Thailand. And they had the insurgent areas of Thailand

902
01:40:14.20 --> 01:40:19.16
was where all the pot was grown. So they had worked those in surgeon areas during the Vietnam War.

903
01:40:19.72 --> 01:40:25.96
How long did it take you to write Thai stick? 10 years. But that was 1000 hours of interviews we

904
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:33.72
did. Yeah. What do you think the value of the trade, the pot trade coming out of that the surfers

905
01:40:34.28 --> 01:40:41.96
brought into America? Well, I mean, at that time, it was great. But but ultimately, it's it's basic

906
01:40:41.96 --> 01:40:50.84
Adam Smith economics. It becomes too expensive to transport it. The the loads get too big. I mean,

907
01:40:50.84 --> 01:40:58.84
we're talking about like 20 30 ton loads. And then it drives the industry to the United States.

908
01:40:59.40 --> 01:41:03.32
California is growing the best spot in the world. So people are like, why don't we just grow it in

909
01:41:03.32 --> 01:41:11.32
Mendocino or, you know, Trinity or one of those counties. And so so there's no the money's gone.

910
01:41:11.32 --> 01:41:19.40
And so that's ultimately what happens in 88. That's where there's there's a bunch of huge busts.

911
01:41:19.40 --> 01:41:24.68
And the the biggest guys kind of go down. And then nobody wants to bother with it. It's

912
01:41:24.68 --> 01:41:31.56
not it. It's implodes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Now at some point during this, you you you got another

913
01:41:31.56 --> 01:41:40.36
book that you're working on right now. Well, I guess before we get to that, you got you did

914
01:41:40.36 --> 01:41:44.84
right end up writing breathe. You wrote the Hixon book. Yeah. And you kind of kind of got into

915
01:41:44.84 --> 01:41:48.84
that a little bit. But what was the what was the spark? How'd you convince Hixon that he needed

916
01:41:48.84 --> 01:41:57.000
to write a book? We had been talking about it for a long, long time. And he and I talk a lot.

917
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.72
And and like I said, and then it's never light. And and there's a lot of stuff I know that he

918
01:42:03.72 --> 01:42:09.64
doesn't know. And there's a lot of stuff that he knows that I don't know. And we always were friends.

919
01:42:09.64 --> 01:42:16.84
And I was a jujitsu skeptic. I was not for how many minutes. Well, I wasn't it wasn't that it didn't

920
01:42:16.84 --> 01:42:24.52
work in a one on one situation. But but in the worlds I was in, I loved it as an exercise thing.

921
01:42:24.52 --> 01:42:31.48
I loved it for the friends I made by going and beating these terrifying guys, and then being

922
01:42:31.48 --> 01:42:36.52
nice and not humiliating them and making them into students and made some of my best friends

923
01:42:36.52 --> 01:42:43.16
around. I mean, I fought guys in West Australia, Canada, Maine, Cambodia, always with the like,

924
01:42:43.16 --> 01:42:49.96
well, that wouldn't work on me. And you know how it goes from there and the skeptic for three minutes.

925
01:42:49.96 --> 01:42:55.000
Yeah. So I was like John the Baptist of jujitsu for a minute there because I was just had

926
01:42:55.56 --> 01:43:02.76
done it early. But I didn't like ease. And I didn't, you know, there were just pieces of it. I didn't

927
01:43:02.76 --> 01:43:10.68
like I like striking. I was confident striking. I had some very patented entries that were kind of

928
01:43:10.68 --> 01:43:19.32
like, you know, I don't have a politically correct way to say it. But the lunging special needs person

929
01:43:19.32 --> 01:43:25.48
and a drunken monkey. Exactly. Just like, good knows what what what and then close the distance.

930
01:43:25.48 --> 01:43:32.84
And so, you know, so I, you know, again, and I would throw this stuff at Hicks and come on, Hicks and

931
01:43:32.84 --> 01:43:38.04
like, yeah, yeah, try to try to disarm me with this knife, like, because I learned the fencing

932
01:43:38.04 --> 01:43:43.56
from the Russian guys and they're so fast. You're not they're not doing this. They're doing that.

933
01:43:43.56 --> 01:43:50.44
And so, you know, we really kind of explored this stuff for a long, long time and in a very

934
01:43:50.44 --> 01:43:55.56
honest way. And we're really good friends through a lot through his son's death. And, you know, I knew

935
01:43:55.56 --> 01:44:03.48
his son well. And so, yeah, he just finally, I think the COVID year, everybody, things were going

936
01:44:03.48 --> 01:44:10.60
slow. And that's how we got going. Well, I mean, that was a fantastic book you and you had the New

937
01:44:10.60 --> 01:44:16.68
York Times bestseller list. Yeah, yeah. Whether they liked it or not. No, Hicks and Hicks and did.

938
01:44:16.68 --> 01:44:24.12
Boy, we got the worst review I've ever had in my life in Publishers Weekly. And it was, you know,

939
01:44:24.12 --> 01:44:32.36
toxic masculinity gone wrong. And it was classic. I loved it. And oh, yeah, it was bad. I wrote a

940
01:44:32.36 --> 01:44:40.20
novel called Final Spin and Publishers Weekly gave me a great review. And it was pretty awesome. And

941
01:44:40.20 --> 01:44:47.08
my editor like sent it to me. He goes, I can't believe this. They compared me to David Mamette.

942
01:44:47.08 --> 01:44:54.12
Wow. And just like, oh, this is, you know, bought. And my publisher was like, dude, this is insane

943
01:44:54.12 --> 01:44:57.56
that they gave you this incredible review. And I was like, well, it's not that insane, bro. It's

944
01:44:57.56 --> 01:45:04.28
an awesome book. But, but yeah, the thing, the thing that was cool about it was I know that

945
01:45:04.28 --> 01:45:09.24
Publishers Weekly, they don't play around. Like if they're coming at you, they have no problem just

946
01:45:09.24 --> 01:45:14.28
trashing your book if they don't like it. So they didn't like breathe. Oh, I hated it. But it was great.

947
01:45:14.28 --> 01:45:21.48
And there was like, nobody should be interested in this book. There's only martial arts deviates or

948
01:45:21.48 --> 01:45:29.56
something to that effect. And, and then it was bestseller a week later. Tell us a little bit.

949
01:45:29.56 --> 01:45:34.20
And you mentioned this quickly. You got the Fainting Robin Foundation, which is a non-profit

950
01:45:34.20 --> 01:45:41.000
that you have the title, the name of the foundation comes from an Emily Dickinson poem, which is,

951
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.64
if I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain. If I can ease one life, the aching

952
01:45:45.64 --> 01:45:52.60
or cool one pain or help one fainting Robin unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain.

953
01:45:53.72 --> 01:45:57.88
Meaning that if you can help someone that's really not in a position to help themselves,

954
01:45:58.60 --> 01:46:02.28
that's going to be a positive thing. Absolutely. What inspired that from you?

955
01:46:02.28 --> 01:46:12.44
I was watching my professions disappear. Journalism, number one. The internet really killed a lot of

956
01:46:13.72 --> 01:46:20.52
our careers. You know, we went from, you know, getting paid per word royalties every time

957
01:46:20.52 --> 01:46:25.80
something was published to flat rates and just it goes on the internet. It's gone forever.

958
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.64
Well, I mean, I kind of look at like that's because I'm on the other side, right?

959
01:46:31.64 --> 01:46:35.56
I'm like the I'm from the people. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we have a podcast.

960
01:46:36.52 --> 01:46:40.76
I remember I went to we had, we'd had this podcast for maybe six months or something,

961
01:46:40.76 --> 01:46:49.64
and I went and got interviewed on NPR. And so I roll into this NPR interview is in New York City.

962
01:46:50.36 --> 01:46:56.92
I go into a full on studio. There's six or seven people behind the glass pane. There's two people

963
01:46:56.92 --> 01:47:00.28
in the room. Then there's the person that's interviewed. It's massive, like this massive

964
01:47:00.28 --> 01:47:05.88
production. I mean, as you can see, like this is the we're sitting in our recording studio right

965
01:47:05.88 --> 01:47:10.28
now, which is literally a converted closet. This used to be the maintenance closet at Victory MMA

966
01:47:10.28 --> 01:47:15.16
and Fitness. We eventually made it a little bit bigger than it used to be. But I go in there.

967
01:47:15.16 --> 01:47:19.56
And so then I go, you know, like how many people listen to you? How many? What's the audience of

968
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:23.16
your show? Because I was talking to the guy a little bit afterwards, and he gave me some number.

969
01:47:23.16 --> 01:47:31.16
And it was some not big number. And I was like, dang, here's me and Echo Charles with a thousand

970
01:47:31.16 --> 01:47:34.20
dollars worth, literally a thousand dollars worth of equipment. How don't you spend when you first

971
01:47:34.20 --> 01:47:40.20
bought the gear? Yeah, a thousand dollars worth of equipment. And our audience was at least 20,

972
01:47:40.20 --> 01:47:45.000
literally 20 times as big as theirs. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm thinking this is kind of awesome. Oh, yeah.

973
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.44
Here's these people, they went to school, and they got promotion, and they're paying, they're paying

974
01:47:50.44 --> 01:47:54.44
people to listen to advertisements going on, all this stuff, all this hype. And we're sitting in

975
01:47:54.44 --> 01:48:00.04
here in a closet with a thousand dollars worth of equipment. Our audience is at least 20 times

976
01:48:00.04 --> 01:48:07.24
bigger than theirs. So I support the downfall of journalism. Yeah. So tell me your take. What am

977
01:48:07.24 --> 01:48:13.88
I missing? Well, it is much journalism. It's academia. And because I was also a professor.

978
01:48:13.88 --> 01:48:18.60
And that are you going to make me attack the academic profession now? Oh, let's go.

979
01:48:18.60 --> 01:48:28.92
I'm happy to help. But know that, you know, I basically was making less money as a professor

980
01:48:28.92 --> 01:48:36.84
with three, two books, three books, Ivy League PhD than I made as construction labor without a

981
01:48:36.84 --> 01:48:43.000
high school diploma at 17 years old without adjusting anything for inflation. And so what

982
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.56
we've seen in academia is that the money's gone to middle management. So every special interest

983
01:48:49.56 --> 01:48:55.72
group now has a commissar that they go to who advocates for them. And the student is a customer

984
01:48:55.72 --> 01:49:00.68
now. So that's completely explained to me the commissar in the middle here. How's that taking

985
01:49:00.68 --> 01:49:08.76
money out of this professor's well, because Professor salaries have dropped 10 years disappeared to

986
01:49:08.76 --> 01:49:17.56
make way for this managerial class. And so the managerial class, you know, will typically when

987
01:49:17.56 --> 01:49:23.80
I first started, I would be the assistant dean for a semester. It was always a professor. Now

988
01:49:23.80 --> 01:49:30.04
you have people who are neither scholars nor teachers. And this is this, you know, I have a

989
01:49:30.04 --> 01:49:37.64
PhD in education. Come on, you know, you can teach or you can't teach. I can't teach you how to teach.

990
01:49:37.64 --> 01:49:45.88
And it's as much an art as it is a science. And and it's depressing, frankly. And I don't want to

991
01:49:45.88 --> 01:49:54.36
be around it. It's not there's just there would. Yeah, that's a whole that's a whole big ball

992
01:49:54.36 --> 01:49:59.40
of wax. But I was going to college when I went to college when I was 28 years old, because I had

993
01:49:59.40 --> 01:50:02.20
been in the military in the military sent me to college, I was going to the University of San

994
01:50:02.20 --> 01:50:06.60
Diego. And I was in class, I had an English professor, super nice professor, super cool. I was

995
01:50:06.60 --> 01:50:12.92
an English major. And she said at the beginning one of these classes, so I'd been in the Navy,

996
01:50:12.92 --> 01:50:17.000
I'd listened to Navy when I was 18 years old. And so I'd been in the Navy for 10 years at that time.

997
01:50:17.64 --> 01:50:23.08
And the professor, you know, was kind of saying, Hey, listen, you know, here I am, I'm a tenured

998
01:50:23.08 --> 01:50:29.32
professor. I have a PhD in literature, blah, blah, blah, blah. I went to this school and that school.

999
01:50:29.32 --> 01:50:36.84
And she goes, And yet I can't afford a house in San Diego. And so I'm sitting in the front row,

1000
01:50:36.84 --> 01:50:40.60
which I always did. I sat in the front row of every class just looking at the professors,

1001
01:50:40.60 --> 01:50:44.76
just like no one else cared, I would line up my pens, like in case I had a pen go down,

1002
01:50:44.76 --> 01:50:48.52
I'd be ready with a secondary. And so I'm sitting there in the front row, and I would,

1003
01:50:48.52 --> 01:50:54.04
I would over, I guess I was being a little bit abrasive, a little bit abrasive. But the teachers

1004
01:50:54.04 --> 01:50:58.12
usually love me because I was like the old, I would most fully engage soon, they probably

1005
01:50:58.12 --> 01:51:01.000
never had in their lives. So I'm sitting in the front row, she gets done with her tirade,

1006
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.92
and I just raised my hand, you know, straight up in the air. And she's like, And this,

1007
01:51:04.92 --> 01:51:09.24
when I went to college was the only place in my life that they called me John, because that's

1008
01:51:09.24 --> 01:51:12.04
what was on the roster. Because my real name is John. So they call me John, I never corrected

1009
01:51:12.04 --> 01:51:17.96
him because I didn't care. So she says, you know, Yes, John. And I said, How, how long did you go

1010
01:51:17.96 --> 01:51:22.76
to school for? And she goes, Well, it was told, I think it was the total was 10 years, you know,

1011
01:51:22.76 --> 01:51:27.48
to get her, blah, blah, blah, this, this, this. I said, And how much did that cost you? And she

1012
01:51:27.48 --> 01:51:32.84
said, you know, whatever it was $380,000 or something like this. And I said, Well, hey,

1013
01:51:33.80 --> 01:51:40.68
I said, I enlisted in the US Navy when I got done with high school. And I've been working that whole

1014
01:51:40.68 --> 01:51:50.36
time. And I have not one house in San Diego, but two. She was so, she was so frustrated with that

1015
01:51:50.36 --> 01:51:55.24
statement. But it's kind of true. Because, you know, she literally spent two, that was what my

1016
01:51:55.24 --> 01:51:58.44
first two houses in San Diego cost, I guess they cost a little bit more than that. But

1017
01:51:59.24 --> 01:52:05.56
that was around what the first two houses I bought in San Diego. So, you know, that academic thing.

1018
01:52:06.12 --> 01:52:12.12
And I mean, the academic world just seems to be have gone, it's gone insane. Am I wrong?

1019
01:52:12.12 --> 01:52:18.60
Absolutely right. And, and the thing is, and I've seen this for a long time and spoken out against

1020
01:52:18.60 --> 01:52:25.80
it for a long time, I'm a First Amendment absolutist. I believe anything short of that is

1021
01:52:25.80 --> 01:52:33.24
sophistry, that this group gets this level and you, you know, and then we come back to, to comfort

1022
01:52:33.24 --> 01:52:40.84
and safety and psychic damage in this and that and oh, you're, you can't, you know, criticize this

1023
01:52:40.84 --> 01:52:45.88
group because of the psychic damage, you're inflicting this and that once you go down that road,

1024
01:52:45.88 --> 01:52:50.92
you're, you're in sophistry lane and I don't want to play that game. And so,

1025
01:52:52.68 --> 01:52:59.40
yeah, it's just everyone, my friends who are still in academia, walk on eggshells and,

1026
01:53:00.12 --> 01:53:06.60
you know, they have to watch out for the cultural commissars because, you know, then you have this

1027
01:53:06.60 --> 01:53:15.56
kind of a star chamber courts where the student goes to one of the many deans and says,

1028
01:53:15.56 --> 01:53:19.72
the, he looked at me in a way that made me uncomfortable and my response to me, you were

1029
01:53:19.72 --> 01:53:25.64
born uncomfortable. I can't help you with that and your level of comfort and my level of comfort

1030
01:53:25.64 --> 01:53:33.96
aren't the same. So then the professor is accused without a hearing, without knowing who his accuser

1031
01:53:33.96 --> 01:53:40.84
is. So there's no due process. I mean, one of the cases my foundation looked into was an anatomy

1032
01:53:40.84 --> 01:53:48.12
professor named Michael Shively. He taught for 30 years at Utah Valley University. The president

1033
01:53:48.12 --> 01:53:57.40
of the university son, universities, what was it, nephew kind of instigated a crusade against him

1034
01:53:57.40 --> 01:54:06.36
because he was, his classes were too hard. He didn't put things up on the right, you know,

1035
01:54:06.36 --> 01:54:14.76
blackboard, you know, sort of computer thing and they couldn't really get him on anything. And again,

1036
01:54:14.76 --> 01:54:20.84
he didn't know who he was accused by. He didn't know what he was accused of. And after about six

1037
01:54:20.84 --> 01:54:26.36
months, he started losing his mind and he blew his brains out. And then the family sued the

1038
01:54:26.36 --> 01:54:32.28
university. It came out that it was, you know, that the president of the university intervened

1039
01:54:32.28 --> 01:54:39.88
on behalf of her nephew. It went all the way to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Now their attorney

1040
01:54:39.88 --> 01:54:45.24
is going for a writ of cert to try to get the Supreme Court to take it up. But these are

1041
01:54:46.12 --> 01:54:51.96
increasingly common situations where you are accused of something and you don't get to defend

1042
01:54:51.96 --> 01:54:58.12
yourself. You don't know who your accuser is. And this is a real violation of due process. And I

1043
01:54:58.12 --> 01:55:04.92
mean, I had a situation where I had a female student come and say, oh, well, I was, I was,

1044
01:55:05.96 --> 01:55:10.28
I couldn't do, I've been missing the classes or something because I was sexually assaulted. I

1045
01:55:10.28 --> 01:55:17.24
said, okay, that's very serious. I said, let's, I know the US attorney and like, let's do it, you

1046
01:55:17.24 --> 01:55:23.08
know, if you, you got to think this through, if you want to, you know, go really do this, you go

1047
01:55:23.08 --> 01:55:29.80
to the US attorney, you don't go or would the DA in town, you don't go to some academic bureaucrat

1048
01:55:29.80 --> 01:55:35.40
that will pollute the case. If you want to go after this guy, oh, well, I'm not sure. I'm not

1049
01:55:35.40 --> 01:55:40.84
sure. I said, well, look, you think about it. Let's talk about it. Tomorrow I go to the head of my

1050
01:55:40.84 --> 01:55:46.92
department. I say, Hey, this happened. I told her she needs to go to the authorities if she's serious

1051
01:55:46.92 --> 01:55:52.92
about it. She said, no, no, no, she has to go to the Title IX group and the this, which is an in-house

1052
01:55:52.92 --> 01:56:00.36
university judiciary. And I said, no, I don't, I don't agree. And I, I'm not going to do that. And

1053
01:56:00.36 --> 01:56:06.60
I'm on one semester contract. So what do you got on me? And I liked my department head. And I didn't,

1054
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:11.64
you know, want to make trouble for. But then I met with a student the next day, I said, okay,

1055
01:56:11.64 --> 01:56:17.24
come on, let's get into the brass tax of this, because if you do go down this road of litigation

1056
01:56:17.24 --> 01:56:23.88
and all that, you're going to get your past pulled out, it's going to be serious. And I said, was

1057
01:56:23.88 --> 01:56:31.000
there alcohol involved? Yeah. Okay. And so anyway, it turns out she drank too much, passed out on a

1058
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.56
couch at a friend's woke up and there was one of the roommates had come in and was standing over her.

1059
01:56:36.68 --> 01:56:42.76
And, and, you know, that could have ended this guy's career. It could have been incredibly

1060
01:56:42.76 --> 01:56:46.52
problematic. And he wouldn't have known what he was accused of by who, or what.

1061
01:56:46.52 --> 01:56:51.56
Oh, that was the extent of what it happens, what it happened. And so, you know,

1062
01:56:54.12 --> 01:57:01.16
again, these things need to be heard out, you can't just take, you know, every man is guilty,

1063
01:57:01.16 --> 01:57:08.20
every woman is always right. Life is more complex than that. I mean, I saw professors that married

1064
01:57:08.20 --> 01:57:15.08
students that are still married. So I don't have a kind of childlike view of life. I treated my

1065
01:57:15.08 --> 01:57:21.08
students as adults. And I talked to them like adults and I talked to them about their futures.

1066
01:57:21.08 --> 01:57:25.80
And, you know, I would say every student would have to come and meet me in my office and people

1067
01:57:25.80 --> 01:57:32.44
would say, Oh, don't ever close your door with a female student. So why I'm, you know, I'm married,

1068
01:57:32.44 --> 01:57:39.96
I'm not like your students like your kids. And, and I would say, what's your major?

1069
01:57:39.96 --> 01:57:46.12
What are you, what's your major? What do you want to do? What do your parents want you to do? And

1070
01:57:46.12 --> 01:57:51.16
how much student debt do you have? Almost every one of those kids would say, no one's ever asked

1071
01:57:51.16 --> 01:57:57.32
me that in my career. Thank you so much. No one, they've tried to sell them into a new program. Oh,

1072
01:57:57.32 --> 01:58:04.44
we got this new graduate certificate. And I was like, what a certificate? I said, is that a masters?

1073
01:58:04.44 --> 01:58:11.24
No, it's a certificate. I said, that's a fucking scam. And, and so, and I said, are they paying for

1074
01:58:11.24 --> 01:58:18.44
you to get this certificate? Oh, no, I got to pay. I said, well, is the professor that's telling you

1075
01:58:18.44 --> 01:58:24.12
to do it in charge of this certificate program? Hey, how'd you know? I was like, man, you're getting

1076
01:58:24.12 --> 01:58:30.76
hustled. And, and so it's a business now. And because the universities are competing with each

1077
01:58:30.76 --> 01:58:39.64
other, you know, to get students, they're spending huge amounts of money on gyms and vegan food bars

1078
01:58:39.64 --> 01:58:50.12
and you know, just really ancillary stuff. You know, when I look at it, if you can get,

1079
01:58:50.12 --> 01:58:55.96
if you're going to learn something of value, if you're going to be actually educated, great,

1080
01:58:55.96 --> 01:59:02.92
knowledge is power. And you can, if you can go to go to some event or some school or some university,

1081
01:59:02.92 --> 01:59:06.84
and you're going to learn something, you're going to walk out of there and say, oh, I know how to do

1082
01:59:06.84 --> 01:59:12.76
this thing now. More power to you. Great. But yeah, if you're in there and you're spending money on

1083
01:59:12.76 --> 01:59:18.04
something that has no value other than the paper that it's printed on, then it's, it's kind of

1084
01:59:18.04 --> 01:59:26.12
worthless. And I don't know that I think that a lot of times the way the what, what people are taught

1085
01:59:26.12 --> 01:59:31.96
isn't really a usable skill. And especially the way it's taught isn't really a usable skill. I mean,

1086
01:59:31.96 --> 01:59:36.20
this happens with leadership, you know, a lot of there's, there's universities that offer some kind

1087
01:59:36.20 --> 01:59:41.72
of leadership training, but it's not actually leadership training. They don't learn any leadership

1088
01:59:41.72 --> 01:59:47.40
from it. They learn some weird abstract theory about leadership, but they don't know how,

1089
01:59:47.40 --> 01:59:51.40
they don't know how, they don't learn how to lead. It's like if you went to college to play,

1090
01:59:51.96 --> 01:59:56.36
to play guitar, and they never gave you a guitar to play, you wouldn't know how to play when you

1091
01:59:56.36 --> 01:59:59.96
got done. You'd be able to talk about it a little bit, but you wouldn't be able to do it. And I see

1092
01:59:59.96 --> 02:00:04.12
a lot of programs that are set up like that, where they're teaching you a lot about the guitar,

1093
02:00:04.12 --> 02:00:07.96
and you learn some theory about the guitar, and you know what a guitar looks like, but you

1094
02:00:07.96 --> 02:00:13.72
don't know how to play that guitar. And so basically what you learned has almost no value. So, you

1095
02:00:13.72 --> 02:00:17.88
know, for leadership, for me, you know, the reason I know this is because I teach leadership,

1096
02:00:17.88 --> 02:00:22.28
and we teach leadership to people that have gone through big programs, and they don't,

1097
02:00:22.28 --> 02:00:26.68
they'll tell us like, oh, I learned more in the three days I just spent with your company

1098
02:00:26.68 --> 02:00:31.000
about leadership, infinitely more. So, not even close to what I learned in my two-year,

1099
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:36.20
you know, master's degree or in my MBA. They just don't, they're not doing it in the same way.

1100
02:00:36.20 --> 02:00:40.44
So, and I think that that's kind of become the standard. Sure. The standard is, oh, well, we can

1101
02:00:40.44 --> 02:00:46.92
teach you about the guitar, and we can teach you about the music theory, and they can teach you

1102
02:00:46.92 --> 02:00:50.12
a bunch of different guitars. We're gonna have a bunch of different guitars come and talk to you.

1103
02:00:50.84 --> 02:00:54.12
We're gonna have the best, we're gonna have Eric Clapton come and talk to you, and Tony Iomi,

1104
02:00:54.12 --> 02:00:59.32
it's gonna be great. And that is cool. Sounds cool, right? But you still don't know how to play guitar.

1105
02:00:59.32 --> 02:01:04.12
Right. So, we like to get them playing that guitar. Right, right. Get on that gift box.

1106
02:01:04.12 --> 02:01:12.12
But you're playing a high stakes game in your view of leadership, that there's actually something

1107
02:01:12.12 --> 02:01:16.84
on the table. Well, yeah. But I mean, I teach businesses. I mean, the vast majority of clients

1108
02:01:16.84 --> 02:01:23.72
I have now are, look, we teach law enforcement, we teach military, absolutely. But we mostly

1109
02:01:23.72 --> 02:01:28.92
teach businesses. Sure. Business leaders. Now, business leaders actually do have something real

1110
02:01:28.92 --> 02:01:34.04
at stake. They got jobs, they got capital, they got safety. There's, for sure, this is all

1111
02:01:34.04 --> 02:01:40.52
really important stuff. But it is derived from the highest of consequences. Sure.

1112
02:01:41.32 --> 02:01:51.16
Without question. And so because of all these changes, good and bad, maybe mostly bad,

1113
02:01:51.16 --> 02:01:55.08
some definitely good. Because like I said, it's good that Echo Charles and I could sit in this

1114
02:01:55.08 --> 02:02:00.84
room with $1,000 worth of equipment and talk to way more people than NPR. Yeah. In a lot of cases.

1115
02:02:00.84 --> 02:02:09.80
You made the fainting Robin Foundation. So the mission is to help out people that need it.

1116
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:18.60
Yeah. And it grew. Like it started out professors, journalists, and journalists pushing the envelope.

1117
02:02:18.60 --> 02:02:26.28
Right. The real guys like Ed Villamy, who was British Newsman of the Year, testified in the

1118
02:02:26.28 --> 02:02:34.28
Hague, found the Serb camps in Bosnia, the people that are outliers that are coming into the later

1119
02:02:34.28 --> 02:02:39.32
parts of their career and have really put it all out there. Isn't it kind of cool now that you can

1120
02:02:39.32 --> 02:02:45.000
do that with no, without being part of the mainstream media at all? I mean, there's plenty of people

1121
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.12
out there that are publishing. I mean, I know you have a sub-stack. Sure. Sub-stack. I love sub-stack.

1122
02:02:50.12 --> 02:02:53.48
You know, that's a way that you can go and you can get published and you can publish your stuff and

1123
02:02:53.48 --> 02:02:56.60
you can get out there and you don't have to worry about the mainstream media. And say whatever you

1124
02:02:56.60 --> 02:03:02.52
want. You can say whatever you want. Yeah. But then it grew into helping those who can't help

1125
02:03:02.52 --> 02:03:10.20
themselves like a lot of veteran outreach. Your generation of veterans did more heavy lifting

1126
02:03:10.20 --> 02:03:16.68
than, you know, really any generation, I would say in American history with the multiple tours, with

1127
02:03:16.68 --> 02:03:25.72
a lot was asked of you. And I am living in North Carolina. There's a lot of veterans and having a

1128
02:03:25.72 --> 02:03:31.48
hard time finding their way after their time in the service, many of them. And simple things,

1129
02:03:31.48 --> 02:03:36.52
helping them find jobs, helping them do things like that, more complex things, getting them off

1130
02:03:36.52 --> 02:03:42.20
SSRI eyes and the, you know, meds and stuff like that. They're giving out those things like candy,

1131
02:03:42.20 --> 02:03:47.32
you know, you see this track in this most recent stuff that they're saying that depression isn't

1132
02:03:47.32 --> 02:03:52.36
from a chemical imbalance anymore. Yeah, it doesn't work. This is like a big lie. Yeah. Like a 30 year

1133
02:03:52.36 --> 02:03:56.68
lie. Have you heard the Secular Charles? So they used to say, Oh, you're depressed. Okay, it's because

1134
02:03:56.68 --> 02:03:59.40
you have a chemical imbalance in your head. Take these drugs and they'll make you feel better.

1135
02:04:00.12 --> 02:04:04.52
And now they're saying, actually, no, it's not a chemical imbalance. It's just like how you're

1136
02:04:04.52 --> 02:04:08.84
feeling and drugs aren't going to help you in that way that we were saying they were,

1137
02:04:08.84 --> 02:04:14.60
which is really freaking disturbing. Very horrible. And particularly the side effects.

1138
02:04:15.88 --> 02:04:21.96
That's very disturbing. Yeah, the side effects are crazy. And the side effects too, that even

1139
02:04:21.96 --> 02:04:27.96
when you read the fine print about what it's going to do to you, there's finer print that says like,

1140
02:04:27.96 --> 02:04:32.68
Oh, and by the way, if you come off this at this rate, or you mix this with that, it's going to

1141
02:04:32.68 --> 02:04:39.32
make you have literal suicidal ideations. Like it's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, it is. And that I'm,

1142
02:04:39.32 --> 02:04:45.48
and Hickson and I have been talking a lot about that and, and finding, you know, natural ways.

1143
02:04:45.48 --> 02:04:50.68
And I've been, this is some of the things I've been doing, but also doing kind of more direct

1144
02:04:50.68 --> 02:04:56.84
action stuff like a woman, a friend of a friend in Santa Barbara's sister was murdered in Cambodia.

1145
02:04:56.84 --> 02:05:02.28
And we launched an investigation and it took us about eight years, but captured the guy.

1146
02:05:04.60 --> 02:05:10.36
Another guy, the old pot smuggler who did a double life, got double life and a billion

1147
02:05:10.36 --> 02:05:18.04
dollar fine was a big smuggler, but all pot. And, and he did, yeah, 27 years for a conspiracy was

1148
02:05:18.04 --> 02:05:22.60
not part of what, and I, you know, I read these things all the time. A drug conspiracy. Oh,

1149
02:05:22.60 --> 02:05:28.36
yeah. Yeah. And he got out, he got a presidential pardon last year and we were lobbying for that.

1150
02:05:29.72 --> 02:05:36.52
So things kind of, I'm almost like the last resort when everything, every other avenue

1151
02:05:36.52 --> 02:05:43.08
is failed. They wind up at my doorstep and I can't take all of them. I mean, I basically work for

1152
02:05:43.08 --> 02:05:50.28
my kitchen table with no office and, but it's is remarkable what you can do through persistence.

1153
02:05:50.28 --> 02:05:58.52
And, and I have persistence. You're a, you're a one book, a book, a decade, right? Yeah. You got

1154
02:05:58.52 --> 02:06:05.88
definite persistence. So there's a, we got this thread of your, of your writing. And it's the

1155
02:06:05.88 --> 02:06:10.44
thread that you pull through. So, you know, you had the Nuremberg trials. This thread kind of leads

1156
02:06:10.44 --> 02:06:16.68
to war crimes. This war crimes thread leads to Cambodia. The Cambodia thread, you, you find the

1157
02:06:16.68 --> 02:06:22.68
surfers that got rolled up and tortured and killed. That thread leads to tie sticks. There's another

1158
02:06:22.68 --> 02:06:30.20
thread that is something that you're working on now. And that's the battle of Cotang, which happened

1159
02:06:31.88 --> 02:06:39.88
at the end of the Vietnam War. And the Khmer Rouge seized a U.S. merchant ship, the Mayquas.

1160
02:06:39.88 --> 02:06:47.24
And there's this whole thing unfolds. So the, so the Marines go, they recapture the ship,

1161
02:06:47.80 --> 02:06:54.52
but they also assault the island. There's a little island where it looked like the, the crew of the,

1162
02:06:54.52 --> 02:07:01.48
of the Mayquas had been taken. And so the Marines do an assault on this island. Well, the island is,

1163
02:07:01.48 --> 02:07:09.48
it's run by the Khmer Rouge. There's Khmer Rouge elements on there. The, the, they didn't know it.

1164
02:07:09.48 --> 02:07:13.56
The Marines didn't know it at the time, but the crew wasn't on that island at all. And they'd

1165
02:07:13.56 --> 02:07:17.48
actually been released and returned, but they didn't know they're already in the air. They go

1166
02:07:18.04 --> 02:07:24.68
and assault this, this island. And I'm actually going to, you gave me like a kind of sort of a

1167
02:07:24.68 --> 02:07:29.80
draft, your proposal, you're working on it. But let me just read a little chunk of this. This is

1168
02:07:29.80 --> 02:07:37.000
your latest project. It's going to be called left behind. And again, the thread is, how did you get

1169
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:42.44
onto the story? You met someone that was on contact. You met a Cambodian Khmer Rouge. Yeah,

1170
02:07:42.44 --> 02:07:47.56
that was on Kotang Island and fought against the Marines. Yeah, absolutely. This is what opens up

1171
02:07:47.56 --> 02:07:53.48
this story for you. And you also started hearing about you were, you were tracking on the Americans

1172
02:07:53.48 --> 02:07:58.44
that were in S 21, the, the prison. Yeah. Yeah. And you were hearing that there might have been

1173
02:07:58.44 --> 02:08:02.04
other Americans and where were these other Americans? And so you pulled the thread on this.

1174
02:08:02.04 --> 02:08:08.84
Yeah. Let me go to this little section here. From his trench near the East beach, M Psalm,

1175
02:08:08.84 --> 02:08:14.92
and this is the, this is the Cambodian soldier that you met. Yeah. So, or sorry, Khmer Rouge.

1176
02:08:14.92 --> 02:08:22.76
Yeah, one of a number. M Psalm watched knife 23. That's a helicopter. The next chopper attempting

1177
02:08:22.76 --> 02:08:27.000
to land fly straight toward him. This one had a big propeller on top and a small one for steering,

1178
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.16
said some he shoulder his rocket and waited until it was 50 meters away and in his crosshairs.

1179
02:08:33.16 --> 02:08:39.08
I aim for the head and hit the tail, he recalled. The helicopter's tail broke off with an audible

1180
02:08:39.08 --> 02:08:47.32
snap. And now the rudderless CH 53 shuttered, spun and crash landed on the beach. All 25 Americans

1181
02:08:47.32 --> 02:08:53.40
on board were able to escape from the wreckage and find cover soldiers in stretchy robes jumped

1182
02:08:53.40 --> 02:08:59.72
down, said some there was exchange of fire. Now due to clouds of thick dust and smoke from the

1183
02:08:59.72 --> 02:09:05.08
gunfire, the Khmer Rouge commander could not even see the beach and took a moment to pray to Buddha

1184
02:09:05.08 --> 02:09:11.08
for help. I had been fighting all my life. But the fighting on co tang was really terrifying.

1185
02:09:11.88 --> 02:09:18.36
The initial assault on the island had been a debacle. In less than one hour, the US had lost

1186
02:09:18.36 --> 02:09:24.76
three helicopters and 11 men. The young Marines who had been training in Okinawa less than 48

1187
02:09:24.76 --> 02:09:31.72
hours earlier were now experiencing combat for the first time all alone at seven at only 720 a.m.

1188
02:09:31.72 --> 02:09:36.92
The longest day of their lives was just beginning. Unbeknownst to the Americans and Cambodians now

1189
02:09:36.92 --> 02:09:43.72
fighting on co tang minutes before knife 21 landed on the island, Khmer Rouge radioed announced

1190
02:09:43.72 --> 02:09:50.92
that they had freed the my gues and her crew. Even worse, the prisoners were not and had never been

1191
02:09:51.64 --> 02:09:59.80
on the island. Al Bailey was standing waist deep in a Khmer Rouge latrine almost out of ammunition

1192
02:09:59.80 --> 02:10:07.08
fighting for his life. He was happy to see Jolly Green 43 the big Sikorsky HH 53 search and rescue

1193
02:10:07.08 --> 02:10:14.68
helicopter approach the land. The young Marine was even happier when he saw his six foot to 250

1194
02:10:14.68 --> 02:10:23.64
pound Sergeant Fofo Sergeant T and you say that to a lot to tell me to tell me Sergeant Sergeant

1195
02:10:23.64 --> 02:10:30.60
T to tell me walk onto the beach with mortar rounds exploding around him like a comic book superhero

1196
02:10:31.40 --> 02:10:36.44
Sergeant T stepped out of the helicopter and was like, let me get this shit under control.

1197
02:10:36.44 --> 02:10:41.40
It was a walk in the park to him. He was ready to conduct business recalled Bailey.

1198
02:10:41.40 --> 02:10:45.96
He was like a pissed off parent who had just found someone had abused his kids

1199
02:10:46.92 --> 02:10:49.24
born and raised in American Samoa.

1200
02:10:51.80 --> 02:10:57.64
Man, how do you say his first name? Fofo. Okay, just leaving it. You got you got the full name here.

1201
02:10:57.64 --> 02:11:00.76
Fofo my to golly something like to like to like golly.

1202
02:11:00.76 --> 02:11:08.04
To a telly better known as Fofo moved to Hawaii at 10 and joined the Marines at 18.

1203
02:11:08.04 --> 02:11:13.16
He spent his first tour in 1967 as a scout sniper hunting vietcong in the jungle.

1204
02:11:13.16 --> 02:11:19.40
During his second tour, he fought in Chu Lai case on in the battle of Hue and was awarded two

1205
02:11:19.40 --> 02:11:24.12
presidential sites unit citations for extraordinary heroism and a bronze star.

1206
02:11:24.76 --> 02:11:30.12
After to telly's request for a third tour was denied. He became a platoon Sergeant with

1207
02:11:30.12 --> 02:11:34.84
Second Battalion ninth Marines and had been training Al Bailey squad when he received word

1208
02:11:34.84 --> 02:11:39.08
that training was over and that he would be leading them into combat for the first time.

1209
02:11:39.08 --> 02:11:44.04
Although the soft spoken Samoan treated his men well, he'd made quite an impression on his charges

1210
02:11:44.04 --> 02:11:49.56
in Okinawa when he broke up a fight between a black and a white Marine by placing each of them

1211
02:11:49.56 --> 02:11:56.76
in headlocks. He shouted Marines don't fight Marines. Fofo smashed their heads together

1212
02:11:56.76 --> 02:12:03.96
and knocked them both unconscious. Nobody and I mean nobody ever challenged him said Bailey.

1213
02:12:03.96 --> 02:12:09.16
This man had killed a rack of Vietnamese. You could see it in his demeanor the way he carried

1214
02:12:09.16 --> 02:12:14.52
himself. When Sergeant T spotted his Marines clumped together on the West Beach, he ran toward

1215
02:12:14.52 --> 02:12:19.32
them shouting what the fuck are you guys doing calm the hell down and listen. Fofo worked his

1216
02:12:19.32 --> 02:12:24.28
way up and down their line giving orders and words of encouragement. Finally he turned to Bailey

1217
02:12:24.28 --> 02:12:29.24
and said only fire when the helicopter comes in don't waste ammo watch the trail any of these

1218
02:12:29.24 --> 02:12:35.08
bastards cross the trail blow their ass away. Then he grabbed his M16 and said I'm gonna take care

1219
02:12:35.08 --> 02:12:41.88
of this machine gun problem no shooting until I get back and vanished into the jungle. Fofo walked

1220
02:12:41.88 --> 02:12:48.04
carefully in under the canopy until he heard an incoming American helicopter then he stopped and

1221
02:12:48.04 --> 02:12:53.72
listened. The Samoan saw some branches move then he spotted two bare-chested Cambodians with red

1222
02:12:53.72 --> 02:12:59.24
checkered scarves around their heads adjusting a big gun. When they began firing at the helicopter

1223
02:12:59.24 --> 02:13:03.88
he shouldered his weapon but could not get a clear shot because of the foliage so he walked all the

1224
02:13:03.88 --> 02:13:10.76
way to the edge of the machine gun nest and opened fire. By the time Fofo had emptied his one magazine

1225
02:13:11.64 --> 02:13:17.56
one magazine one Khmer Rouge soldier lay dead and another was wounded but still alive rather

1226
02:13:17.56 --> 02:13:22.76
than reload the Marine picked up a nearby machete hacked the wounded man until he stopped moving

1227
02:13:22.76 --> 02:13:30.04
then grabbed their AK-47s cigarettes canteens and sandals as he worked his way back toward the

1228
02:13:30.04 --> 02:13:36.36
west beach he saw another occupied bunker opened fire and ran towards it by the time the Samoan

1229
02:13:36.36 --> 02:13:41.88
reached it the bunker was empty but a fire was still burning a pot of rice cooking and there

1230
02:13:41.88 --> 02:13:54.36
was a fresh blood trail leading into the jungle. So this is some serious scrapping that these guys

1231
02:13:54.36 --> 02:14:03.000
are going through and just going through some of the events it took place by 0700 there's 109

1232
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.48
Marines on the island three of the helos there was eight helos used in the assault three of them

1233
02:14:09.48 --> 02:14:18.92
were destroyed on the insert between 0900 and 10100 100 additional Marines had been landed on the

1234
02:14:18.92 --> 02:14:26.12
island nine had been wounded and those guys had been evacuated which meant there was about 225

1235
02:14:26.12 --> 02:14:31.88
Marines on the island they make they're fighting throughout the day they make multiple attempts

1236
02:14:31.88 --> 02:14:39.64
to extract the Marines they drop at 1800 at night they drop a freaking blue 82 massive bomb it's

1237
02:14:39.64 --> 02:14:44.36
they call it a daisy cutter I mean it's just a massive bomb it creates a mushroom cloud it's huge

1238
02:14:46.04 --> 02:14:51.80
after dark they finally start to get extracted they're loading helos under fire they leave dead

1239
02:14:51.80 --> 02:14:59.24
behind they also leave with a false head count meaning they think that they have everyone but

1240
02:14:59.24 --> 02:15:06.92
they don't they finally get back on the ships you know and now they do a head count of a legit

1241
02:15:06.92 --> 02:15:13.16
head count and they they figure out that they're missing Lance Corporal Joseph Hargrove PFC Gary

1242
02:15:13.16 --> 02:15:21.24
Hall and Private Danny Marshall and then they received a radio transmission from those guys

1243
02:15:21.80 --> 02:15:26.84
like one of the aircraft circling overhead receives a radio transmission saying hey swim to see and

1244
02:15:26.84 --> 02:15:32.84
we'll we'll get you and they respond only one of us only one of the Marines could swim effectively

1245
02:15:32.84 --> 02:15:41.96
enough to actually swim to see and and these guys get declared missing in action on July 21st

1246
02:15:41.96 --> 02:15:49.88
1976 those were changed to kill in action the way it turned out Joseph Hargrove was captured

1247
02:15:49.88 --> 02:15:55.24
pretty quickly he had a leg wound and then a week later and you go through the details even in this

1248
02:15:55.24 --> 02:15:58.28
I don't want to you know obviously you're going to put a whole book together on this that we'll

1249
02:15:58.28 --> 02:16:02.92
have to we'll have to cover on the podcast and I hope we can get Fofo in here to get it done

1250
02:16:03.64 --> 02:16:05.96
that's the plan um

1251
02:16:07.96 --> 02:16:13.48
you know because I know this and you talk about it here but he was he received the Navy Cross

1252
02:16:14.04 --> 02:16:21.64
is that correct the Navy no he didn't receive he got uh it was interesting because on

1253
02:16:21.64 --> 02:16:29.40
one of it's the Marine it was a very lower metal and I had a general look at the whole paperwork

1254
02:16:29.40 --> 02:16:34.60
and the secretary of the Navy had signed it and he said the only reason the secretary of the

1255
02:16:34.60 --> 02:16:40.60
Navy would have ever even seen this was uh because he was either up for the Navy Cross or the

1256
02:16:40.60 --> 02:16:48.44
congressional medal so one of the uh one of the lieutenants got the Navy Cross for doing nothing

1257
02:16:48.44 --> 02:16:56.84
close to what Fofo Tatele had done um and and even one of the things I've been trying to do is get

1258
02:16:56.84 --> 02:17:03.56
them the Vietnam service medal and Tulsi Gabbard and Mark Meadows had tried to do it in 2016 and

1259
02:17:05.08 --> 02:17:11.16
the official government position was well you know the uh the Vietnam War ended when the

1260
02:17:11.16 --> 02:17:18.84
Paris peace agreement was signed in 1973 so this isn't the Vietnam War I mean their names are on

1261
02:17:18.84 --> 02:17:25.32
the wall so it's it's a very strange case and I think there's a institutional embarrassment

1262
02:17:26.04 --> 02:17:31.24
as I demonstrate there there's also knowledge that those men were left behind and I think

1263
02:17:32.04 --> 02:17:40.12
what's motivated me on this case is is how heavily that's weighed on those Marines and those

1264
02:17:40.12 --> 02:17:48.04
who knew that and were ordered not to talk about it as well and so um I spoke at their reunion this

1265
02:17:49.24 --> 02:17:55.88
last May and um you know this is something that you know many of these guys have been back to

1266
02:17:55.88 --> 02:18:02.76
Cambodia they've met with M. Somme they've pleaded with him where are their bodies and you know and

1267
02:18:02.76 --> 02:18:11.24
I they they've sent the POWMIA guys from Camp Smith there to do the the mitochondria DNA

1268
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:20.36
and it's you know I think that the Ford administration acted very badly I think that they

1269
02:18:20.36 --> 02:18:27.64
already had it planted on the New York Times as America is back and that was that was you know the

1270
02:18:27.64 --> 02:18:34.04
height of our impotence so this is May 15th 1975 this is two weeks after the fall of Saigon

1271
02:18:35.08 --> 02:18:41.88
yeah that's one thing that makes it so and again that you've got some of the details even that that

1272
02:18:41.88 --> 02:18:49.000
I read here just that you're used to this kind of incompetence in Vietnam now by you know the

1273
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:57.48
generals the politicians McNamara LBJ like you're just used to this disgusting lack of ability

1274
02:18:57.48 --> 02:19:05.48
to make decisions and lead and not be influenced just by raw politics on a daily basis just disgusting

1275
02:19:05.48 --> 02:19:11.24
yeah and then but what's interesting about this this is like one incident and since it's a little

1276
02:19:11.24 --> 02:19:17.96
bit separated and you've got a different administration you go oh it's the same incompetence

1277
02:19:17.96 --> 02:19:22.92
and you just see these decisions getting made and these cover-ups are happening it's just gross

1278
02:19:22.92 --> 02:19:27.72
yeah it's gross and of course it's the freaking men on the ground the Marines that pay the pay the

1279
02:19:27.72 --> 02:19:31.40
ultimate price for these horrible decisions I mean you got a section in there about the seal

1280
02:19:31.40 --> 02:19:36.52
commander yeah amazing yeah who's like this is total bullshit he's calling it good for him

1281
02:19:37.08 --> 02:19:44.44
um yeah Tom Coulter and he basically you know faced down the admiral and said okay I'm gonna

1282
02:19:44.44 --> 02:19:50.60
leave room on the front of my zodiac for you and your officers and you can go on that island with me

1283
02:19:50.60 --> 02:19:56.92
and they were not honest with him either and they said oh we want to drop leaflets and this is kind

1284
02:19:56.92 --> 02:20:06.44
of you know they had the lithographer aboard one of the navy ships print 10 000 cards Cambodian

1285
02:20:06.44 --> 02:20:13.32
French and English saying bring all the Americans to the helicopter wreckage including the dead ones

1286
02:20:14.12 --> 02:20:19.48
so that does lead you to believe they knew that these guys were behind I left behind I have no doubt

1287
02:20:19.48 --> 02:20:27.08
they knew and um and again it was already on the cover of the New York Times and the press

1288
02:20:27.08 --> 02:20:33.72
attempt and you know the pictures of Kissinger and Rumsfeld and Ford and Tuxedo smoking cigars and

1289
02:20:33.72 --> 02:20:39.80
you know it's it's the carelessness of the human material you know that's the part to me that's

1290
02:20:39.80 --> 02:20:47.16
so galling and I you know as the war on terror you know kind of pushed forward I'd see it more and

1291
02:20:47.16 --> 02:20:56.12
more just badly used people lives destroyed unnecessarily I mean war is war but you know

1292
02:20:56.12 --> 02:21:01.64
there's a kind of carelessness that only people who risk nothing who are never going to be near it

1293
02:21:01.64 --> 02:21:08.44
who have never felt the hard hand of it or seen the aftermath of it that they can they can entertain

1294
02:21:08.44 --> 02:21:15.32
these fantasies and do it without remorse and do it over and over again yeah yeah I mean you found out

1295
02:21:15.32 --> 02:21:20.44
um through your interviews Joseph Hargrove like I said was captured with a leg wound and executed

1296
02:21:20.44 --> 02:21:26.92
pretty quickly yeah but it was a week later yeah that they captured Gary Hall and Danny Marshall

1297
02:21:26.92 --> 02:21:32.52
so those guys were on the island you got massive American forces around there that could have done

1298
02:21:32.52 --> 02:21:38.60
any number of things to try and get those guys out and they just got yeah and they want and so

1299
02:21:38.60 --> 02:21:45.56
and so you had the marine officers want volunteered to go back the seals wanted to go back I think

1300
02:21:45.56 --> 02:21:52.84
the PJs had gone back to Thailand but the Wayne Fisk unbelievable PJ was on the Sante raid and

1301
02:21:52.84 --> 02:21:59.56
you know the Apollo missions I mean he um you know you had all the all the people ready to do the

1302
02:21:59.56 --> 02:22:06.44
heavy lifting without any qualms about doing it and uh and they just steamed away and left them

1303
02:22:06.44 --> 02:22:13.24
you know left them behind gone and you know and that's uh they were stealing rice from the Khmeruja

1304
02:22:13.24 --> 02:22:19.000
and so basically they finally saw boot prints going into their kitchen because every day the Khmeruja

1305
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.84
guys hey why'd you eat the leftover rice I didn't eat the leftover rice no you did you know so they're

1306
02:22:24.84 --> 02:22:32.20
fighting about this and then the get they go to M.S.M. and they the same accounts of the rice missing

1307
02:22:32.20 --> 02:22:37.96
uh is happening over and over so then they say okay there's still two guys here so let's set up an

1308
02:22:37.96 --> 02:22:44.28
ambush they capture them coming at night to get the rice and they're at this point so physically

1309
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:49.96
beaten down they don't even bother to tie them up and in fact according to the Khmeruja they made

1310
02:22:49.96 --> 02:22:55.40
them rice and made them food and they just waited for their orders and then they sent them to the

1311
02:22:55.40 --> 02:23:02.04
mainland then they were put in a prison then they were probably interrogated and executed.

1312
02:23:04.68 --> 02:23:07.64
So where's what's the status of this book right now?

1313
02:23:08.28 --> 02:23:16.68
Um uh you know probably 10 years you know no it's been more than 10 years um it's uh it's a hard cell

1314
02:23:17.24 --> 02:23:22.52
and it's funny that's going oh you know we don't want another book about the vietnam war that's

1315
02:23:22.52 --> 02:23:28.68
what my agent was saying and I said look this isn't this is about this is about you know leave no

1316
02:23:28.68 --> 02:23:35.64
man behind this is as old as warfare this is uh a much bigger kind of theme so we'll see I'll

1317
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:42.28
peck away at it but yeah there's not much interest in the vietnam war not that much interest in this

1318
02:23:42.28 --> 02:23:47.24
subject. What's causing what's causing the lack of interest in the vietnam war? I think there were

1319
02:23:47.24 --> 02:23:54.76
too many books uh there was just a big spate of books and it's just publishing now you know

1320
02:23:54.76 --> 02:24:00.12
publishing isn't doing that well and everybody's nervous the economy's going funny it's just

1321
02:24:00.12 --> 02:24:04.44
well that's one of the reasons for that is because you can publish a book with no by yourself

1322
02:24:04.44 --> 02:24:09.08
yeah you know echo Charles could publish a book in a week yeah you could literally publish a book

1323
02:24:09.08 --> 02:24:15.88
in a week yeah and it could be available on amazon and it could have which is 85 of book sales

1324
02:24:15.88 --> 02:24:23.24
or amazon sure right now anyway so so echo Charles could write a book about uh bicep curls yes sir

1325
02:24:23.24 --> 02:24:29.24
and since that's your area of expertise and he could have it published immediately yeah and

1326
02:24:29.24 --> 02:24:35.40
he could have access to 85 percent of the market yeah which is a pretty unbelievable thing sure

1327
02:24:35.40 --> 02:24:41.16
and so yes the publishers are definitely scared about that but I need to go back I gotta go back

1328
02:24:41.16 --> 02:24:47.40
to Cambodia and do some more interviews and um would you if you're gonna make you've made that

1329
02:24:47.40 --> 02:24:51.32
much effort you've made this much effort now you're gonna make some more effort what if no if

1330
02:24:51.32 --> 02:24:53.96
your publisher doesn't want to publish or what are you gonna do you're gonna publish it yourself

1331
02:24:53.96 --> 02:25:02.84
sure eventually but you know I have like three jobs so it's you know it's uh I have to write a

1332
02:25:02.84 --> 02:25:07.32
lot of stuff to pay the bills and then I uh what do you normally write to pay the bills

1333
02:25:07.32 --> 02:25:14.52
uh a lot of ghost writing some screenwriting um yeah have you written any screenplays that

1334
02:25:14.52 --> 02:25:20.76
we've seen no not yet nothing you know it's Hollywood where everything almost always happens

1335
02:25:21.88 --> 02:25:28.92
I wrote I co-wrote the screenplay for the Hixon movie and uh is that coming that's battling with

1336
02:25:28.92 --> 02:25:34.52
Netflix because now Netflix is all you know taken on water and they're all panicky and

1337
02:25:34.52 --> 02:25:42.20
um I wrote a couple of pilots for the tie stick tv series I wrote a really Kelly Slater by the

1338
02:25:42.20 --> 02:25:49.16
the rights to tie stick he did but then he fumbled him and uh yeah he had a deal with Sony and then

1339
02:25:49.80 --> 02:25:56.92
it's just Hollywood and it's it's just it makes the dod seem positively efficient same thing

1340
02:25:56.92 --> 02:26:02.12
is going on though too with like Hollywood because if you want to you could make a movie and you can

1341
02:26:02.12 --> 02:26:07.88
post it on youtube and see what happens well and the thing is like the Hixon movie is remarkable

1342
02:26:07.88 --> 02:26:17.64
because it starts with Maeda so it starts in 1890 in Japan and Maeda is an unbelievable guy I mean

1343
02:26:17.64 --> 02:26:24.84
he's prize fighting all over Europe he comes to the United States like in the 20s he's prize fighting

1344
02:26:24.84 --> 02:26:32.28
in the south he's he's going to west point yeah and and then he fights like one of the gangs in

1345
02:26:32.28 --> 02:26:39.64
New York guys in Brooklyn and and then he goes to Cuba and then I think we think he's the guy who

1346
02:26:39.64 --> 02:26:45.96
invented the Mexican wrestling mask because no one would fight him and then he winds up in Brazil

1347
02:26:45.96 --> 02:26:51.80
with the meets the graces and then that's where the second part of the story goes and Jose Padilla

1348
02:26:51.80 --> 02:26:59.24
did Narcos who's from Rio grew up you know around Hixon and the Gracie's is the director so it ain't

1349
02:26:59.24 --> 02:27:05.16
rocket science yeah that's a no brainer yeah and you're kind of like so I would I think you're right

1350
02:27:05.16 --> 02:27:10.12
I mean I that's what I told Jose Padilla the director I was like go get some private equity

1351
02:27:10.12 --> 02:27:15.32
people I mean this isn't that tough a business case to make yeah come on and that's not it's not

1352
02:27:15.32 --> 02:27:20.36
like a crazy special effects movie or anything either like it's not going to be a huge budget

1353
02:27:20.36 --> 02:27:26.52
film it's big like you know you got some great fights you know you have like Helio fighting

1354
02:27:27.08 --> 02:27:34.36
Camara no Camara but you also have the Black Panther is former student okay Pantera you

1355
02:27:34.36 --> 02:27:41.40
know the three hour 48 minute fight and and just classic stories that Hixon talks about like as his

1356
02:27:41.40 --> 02:27:50.12
childhood and and so all that's in there and it's just you know you could see it Rio in the 70s and you

1357
02:27:50.12 --> 02:27:56.84
know you know surfing yeah drugs and beating you know beating up street fights yeah yeah and so uh

1358
02:27:56.84 --> 02:28:02.76
what's not to like yeah so they'll I don't know I just like when I write something for Hollywood

1359
02:28:02.76 --> 02:28:09.08
I write it and I forget about it and my mom luckily I grew up around this and I grew you know I grew

1360
02:28:09.08 --> 02:28:14.52
up on the set of Robert Altman movies and Altman was all in Altman was put in his house on the line

1361
02:28:14.52 --> 02:28:21.96
to pay for that movie and there was none of this committee decision like the greatest oxymoron

1362
02:28:21.96 --> 02:28:28.60
I've ever seen is what they call in Hollywood a creative executive and and so you go to these

1363
02:28:28.60 --> 02:28:36.92
meetings about meetings and and everybody has and then I get in trouble because I'm not nice enough

1364
02:28:36.92 --> 02:28:42.68
for whatever and then I'm not really allowed to go to meetings anymore and but the best meeting we had

1365
02:28:42.68 --> 02:28:50.36
was we went into Ted Sarandos owner of Netflix's office and my co-author Mike Ritter glass like

1366
02:28:50.36 --> 02:28:57.24
a half a pound of weed in a 1970s single finned pintail and we had the tie stick cover on top of

1367
02:28:57.24 --> 02:29:04.76
it and I pulled out a rubber mallet and a chisel ripped the deck off of it and put a half a pound

1368
02:29:04.76 --> 02:29:09.88
of weed in an abalone shell and pushed it to Ted Sarandos and go there it is it's all yours Ted

1369
02:29:09.88 --> 02:29:17.56
and he's like and I was like nope I'm not taking it back leave it in your commissary whatever and

1370
02:29:17.56 --> 02:29:25.88
so I left it a bunch of weed at Netflix oh well hopefully some of those things get eventually

1371
02:29:25.88 --> 02:29:31.96
made man sounds like good stuff yeah uh that kind of has us up to date yeah we made it we made it

1372
02:29:31.96 --> 02:29:39.72
through your life to this point um what do we miss anything no I don't I mean yeah but no

1373
02:29:39.72 --> 02:29:46.84
I think we got most of the saline points there high points yeah uh people can find you at fainting

1374
02:29:46.84 --> 02:29:54.20
robin.org if they want to support that you've got your sub stack which is peter maguire.substack.com

1375
02:29:54.84 --> 02:30:00.20
sour milk and it's peter maguire's sour milk what's the what's the title about why is it called

1376
02:30:00.20 --> 02:30:08.92
sour milk because I'm sour milk I'm a 57 year old white guy uh you got your books law and order

1377
02:30:09.80 --> 02:30:15.88
sorry law and war facing death in Cambodia tie stick and then the book that I covered on podcast

1378
02:30:15.88 --> 02:30:21.24
293 I think with Hicks and Gracie the book is called breathe I wrote the forward and you did a great

1379
02:30:21.24 --> 02:30:26.28
job and that was the best interview anybody did on that whole book tour oh well I appreciate it it

1380
02:30:26.28 --> 02:30:32.76
was an absolute honor to be able to write that forward um when you hit me up I was like you

1381
02:30:32.76 --> 02:30:37.72
know can you said can you write a forward I was like let me think about that for yes I can well

1382
02:30:37.72 --> 02:30:42.84
thank you uh yeah that's just a great book and and and now you're working on a follow-on book

1383
02:30:42.84 --> 02:30:46.36
with Hicks and yeah and what's the what's the premise of the follow-on book with Hicks and

1384
02:30:46.92 --> 02:30:53.96
it's called invisible jujitsu and it's visible jujitsu yeah and it's there's a lot about jujitsu

1385
02:30:53.96 --> 02:31:00.84
and fighting but there's also a lot about life and a lot about people dealing with problems and

1386
02:31:00.84 --> 02:31:07.72
you know similar to the things you talk about and how the answer can't be found in a pill or a shrink

1387
02:31:07.72 --> 02:31:15.48
and that you know you you kind of have to you you know there's sections on strategy there's sections

1388
02:31:16.60 --> 02:31:23.32
on things Hicks and talks about generally but then I make him you know delve into in much greater

1389
02:31:23.32 --> 02:31:30.20
detail and so I think people will find it very useful for their daily lives trying to get people

1390
02:31:30.20 --> 02:31:36.52
kind of back in their bodies and out of their heads and uh I think there's really something to that

1391
02:31:36.52 --> 02:31:44.44
and we've been teaching a lot of really civilian unathletic people really really basic jujitsu

1392
02:31:44.44 --> 02:31:49.80
and how someone's walking into you what do you do you know do you let them close the distance do you

1393
02:31:49.80 --> 02:31:56.52
so kind of coming back to the old self-defense jujitsu and a very fundamental level and uh

1394
02:31:56.52 --> 02:32:00.84
and I have all these kind of auto shape civilian students I've been testing it on

1395
02:32:00.84 --> 02:32:06.12
and they come every week and they love it even though they go drink 20 beers afterwards and

1396
02:32:06.12 --> 02:32:11.24
get even more out of shape but um but now they want to roll and they're rolling and I've got to be

1397
02:32:11.24 --> 02:32:16.44
careful that they don't get hurt because they're not in the best shape but you really see the change

1398
02:32:16.44 --> 02:32:21.72
on them as we've all seen with jujitsu it does change people yeah I think the one thing with

1399
02:32:21.72 --> 02:32:30.44
Hickson is like jujitsu is so much a part of him that there's you you kind of have to tease it out

1400
02:32:30.44 --> 02:32:34.52
of him it's like the water it's like the water that he lives in right and so you ask him how the

1401
02:32:34.52 --> 02:32:39.16
water tastes like that fish story right how's the how's the water they're like what what's water

1402
02:32:39.16 --> 02:32:46.68
yeah so you're you pulling out because my I I connected so many things in my life because

1403
02:32:46.68 --> 02:32:54.84
of jujitsu it made all the all the pictures start to become assimilated into the same world

1404
02:32:55.40 --> 02:33:01.80
and that was he absolutely huge for me and so I think that you know if you pull those strings on

1405
02:33:01.80 --> 02:33:08.44
on Hickson where he can talk about he makes a decision in life without thinking about it

1406
02:33:08.44 --> 02:33:12.20
because that's just who he is but if you start saying hey why'd you make that decision why would

1407
02:33:12.20 --> 02:33:16.52
you do it that way and then you can he'll start to see and you'll start seeing we'll all start to see

1408
02:33:16.52 --> 02:33:21.80
that's the jujitsu well like he talks about acceptance you know and he'll use these words

1409
02:33:21.80 --> 02:33:26.84
and you'll think it's kind of a new age thing acceptance and this forgiveness and I'll say

1410
02:33:26.84 --> 02:33:32.60
what do you mean acceptance he goes well when finaki broke my orbital bones in my eye socket

1411
02:33:32.60 --> 02:33:39.08
I had to accept the fact that I couldn't see and I was gonna have to fight him blind and I was

1412
02:33:39.08 --> 02:33:44.28
figuring out how I was gonna fight him blind and I can't and I had a plan but then I got a little

1413
02:33:44.28 --> 02:33:49.08
bit of vision back and I took him down and you know broke his knee and then choked him unconscious

1414
02:33:49.08 --> 02:33:56.36
and so so it's funny because like you said to kind of force him to really elaborate on some of this

1415
02:33:56.36 --> 02:34:06.76
stuff the well is deep no doubt awesome man uh echo any questions oh so you have your black belt

1416
02:34:06.76 --> 02:34:14.12
yes when did that happen uh after 30 years I got it I don't know two months ago or something oh you

1417
02:34:14.12 --> 02:34:18.92
just got your black belt yeah I have my black belt in jeek and doe but yeah I was a purple belt I

1418
02:34:18.92 --> 02:34:26.84
think for like 17 years well I only would take belts from hixon so and I didn't I'm not out here

1419
02:34:26.84 --> 02:34:31.80
all the time so do you're a black belt snob listen this guy he's like I only take a black belt from

1420
02:34:31.80 --> 02:34:37.80
here crazy that's it yeah yeah he does make sense though yeah he started with hixon and then you

1421
02:34:37.80 --> 02:34:41.72
know like all your knowledge and stuff like that it's like from hixon and then what some other guy

1422
02:34:41.72 --> 02:34:47.000
kind of slides in yeah he's like you know I train with hands out too but you know it just

1423
02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.12
it was different you know hixon six and I don her I trained with a lot how much did you train with

1424
02:34:52.12 --> 02:34:58.84
hendo not much because I was a daytime guy so I trained with don her and John was a white belt

1425
02:34:58.84 --> 02:35:03.48
I met him when he was a white belt I was a professor at Columbia when he was a graduate student

1426
02:35:04.12 --> 02:35:10.12
and so you guys knew each other oh yeah you guys were bros yeah oh yeah and he would kind of ramp

1427
02:35:10.12 --> 02:35:15.72
me up for Cambodia you know so I just like take these horrible donner beatings for a month so that

1428
02:35:15.72 --> 02:35:21.80
nothing was really that bad in Cambodia the Legionnaires and stuff that didn't know jiu-jitsu so

1429
02:35:21.80 --> 02:35:27.72
I'm so were you there when he quit being whatever he was being at Columbia and he just yeah oh yeah

1430
02:35:27.72 --> 02:35:35.72
yeah yeah and yeah and he I was getting threatened by the Serbs and I was putting on this conference

1431
02:35:35.72 --> 02:35:41.24
and I had all these big Richard Goldstone the chief prosecutor in the Hague and this and that

1432
02:35:41.24 --> 02:35:48.28
and so John Donner and Paredi my old kickboxing coach came as the undercover security and just

1433
02:35:48.28 --> 02:35:54.12
shadowed these two Serbs the whole time it was pretty funny but um yeah John Donner actually

1434
02:35:54.12 --> 02:35:59.40
came to my wedding and wore a three-piece suit he did not wear lycra did he have a did he have a

1435
02:35:59.40 --> 02:36:09.72
butt pack on no Donner was uh he was he's a classic guy and uh we had a lot of fun and uh yeah he was

1436
02:36:09.72 --> 02:36:15.56
I could I could really plumb the depths of my cynicism with Donner

1437
02:36:17.64 --> 02:36:22.84
well he's been awesome to watch him and his team um man they're just dominating yeah jitsu it's

1438
02:36:22.84 --> 02:36:31.000
freaking awesome well he's I mean he's uh really sharp guy and um and you know on some level I think

1439
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:38.76
he saw my academic he saw my academic career and was like no way man I'm just gonna teach you jitsu

1440
02:36:38.76 --> 02:36:45.48
no I remember Henzo and Henzo and Donner came to one of my classes at Columbia and I was teaching

1441
02:36:45.48 --> 02:36:52.20
about Japan and the samurai and this and that had a student go um I don't think it's appropriate for

1442
02:36:52.20 --> 02:36:59.24
you to to get into these these cultural stereotypes about the Japanese warrior culture they had almost

1443
02:36:59.24 --> 02:37:07.000
20 years of Weimar-like democracy just burying my head in my hands and I think that was probably the

1444
02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:13.16
day Donner decided he wasn't gonna become a professor yeah well he's a professor of jitsu

1445
02:37:13.16 --> 02:37:18.36
oh he is he is it's kind of wild you know you you've heard the story that like you know Dean

1446
02:37:18.36 --> 02:37:22.92
Lister is obviously and he he had that conversation with Dean and it's kind of like this mythical

1447
02:37:22.92 --> 02:37:28.52
thing now right it's a little bit of a mythical thing that Dean said you know Dean was get catching

1448
02:37:28.52 --> 02:37:33.64
guys and Dean tells it's super humble you know I was doing okay with my leg locks training with

1449
02:37:33.64 --> 02:37:38.04
some of the students which means people were he was getting tapping people out yeah I can tell you

1450
02:37:38.04 --> 02:37:42.28
that right now because he's tapped me out one million times and I and I've seen it we used to do

1451
02:37:42.28 --> 02:37:46.44
you know dojo storms and all that stuff and even just tournaments he would just foot lock leg lock

1452
02:37:46.44 --> 02:37:52.28
everybody um and win by other methods because his whole game of jiu-jitsu but it's kind of wild

1453
02:37:52.84 --> 02:37:58.20
you know like Donner was asking him like you know or said something like you know you spend a lot

1454
02:37:58.20 --> 02:38:05.24
of time on the you know going for people's legs and and Dean Lister said why would you ignore 50%

1455
02:38:05.24 --> 02:38:12.60
of the human body and that's become this thing yeah yeah but it's if you think about the the

1456
02:38:12.60 --> 02:38:20.20
sharpness of of Donner heard to hear that and go hmm that's a really good point oh yeah that's a

1457
02:38:20.20 --> 02:38:26.28
really good point and Dean was you know Dean it wasn't like if you have the idea that Dean was

1458
02:38:26.28 --> 02:38:33.48
had a couple foot locks in his game and that's what no Dean was way deep in it heel hooks foot

1459
02:38:33.48 --> 02:38:41.000
locks he was way deep in that stuff I mean so far deep into it that people have only caught up

1460
02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.40
I think it's been now it's about a year and a half when Dean I was I would ask Dean like hey have

1461
02:38:45.40 --> 02:38:48.28
you seen anything you didn't know yet it was like a year and a half because yeah now they're starting

1462
02:38:48.28 --> 02:38:54.36
to do things that I don't know but that was a long time where Dean was just way above everybody else

1463
02:38:54.36 --> 02:39:00.04
but it is amazing that Donner heard that saw what he did and said oh yeah there's something going on

1464
02:39:00.04 --> 02:39:05.56
here and of course now we have Pete the Greek who's yeah well he's a wrist locker and he says what

1465
02:39:05.56 --> 02:39:11.56
why would you ignore 5% of the human body yeah yeah well I trained with Lebel also oh hell yeah

1466
02:39:11.56 --> 02:39:18.28
and so I try met him a few times and he's scary and and so I have his book you know he's got a big

1467
02:39:18.28 --> 02:39:23.24
book about wrestling finishing holds that one yeah I guess it is and she has more than one I got a big

1468
02:39:23.24 --> 02:39:29.16
giant book by Judo G Lebel and it's all these crazy finishing holds it also got like weird like you

1469
02:39:29.16 --> 02:39:35.56
have a cane and how you can joke some with a cane and all this other stuff well I grew up watching him

1470
02:39:37.08 --> 02:39:43.96
lucha libre eke eke ka eke televison la hankeles and you know that was wrestling at the Olympic

1471
02:39:43.96 --> 02:39:49.24
and Gene's brother was the announcer and then Gene was the hangman Gene was like three different

1472
02:39:49.24 --> 02:39:55.88
masked guys and and then you know when you train with him he goes into character you know get you

1473
02:39:55.88 --> 02:40:02.44
in some weird neck twist me like who's the most beautiful man in the world and yeah he's a scary guy

1474
02:40:03.16 --> 02:40:11.000
he I mean Judo Gene Lebel he has to be one of the premier guys and and for whatever reason it like

1475
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:18.84
didn't make it out you know like the Gracie's did the most incredible job of marketing jujitsu by

1476
02:40:18.84 --> 02:40:24.92
creating the UFC yeah and Gene Lebel had some some MMA fights oh yeah and he ref what was the big

1477
02:40:24.92 --> 02:40:30.44
fight he ref Anoki and Holly yes right Anoki now he refereed that fight yeah but again it wasn't

1478
02:40:30.44 --> 02:40:35.48
quite it didn't quite get over the hump and maybe UFC wouldn't have made it over the hump

1479
02:40:35.48 --> 02:40:39.16
because you know the fratida brothers and it was banned everywhere and it got eventually got picked

1480
02:40:39.16 --> 02:40:47.40
up but man Judo Gene Lebel he he was a legit submission grappler before that was even a thing

1481
02:40:47.40 --> 02:40:54.60
well he was a au wrestling champ god what a beast he was all japan judo champ at some point

1482
02:40:55.16 --> 02:41:03.48
first american yeah and his mom I think owned the olympic auditorium or ran it something like that

1483
02:41:03.48 --> 02:41:09.16
so he grew up training with like ed strangler lewis yeah the legit catch wrestlers yeah yeah

1484
02:41:09.16 --> 02:41:17.32
the catches catch can guys so he didn't know anything but like you know real nasty old-fashioned

1485
02:41:17.32 --> 02:41:24.52
submission grappling and and yeah and then you I got to go to his cabin at high elevation and you

1486
02:41:24.52 --> 02:41:29.72
show up there at like 10 at night and uh was it a big bear or something yeah and you trained to

1487
02:41:29.72 --> 02:41:37.000
like three in the morning and it was me peretti and john lewis and uh and and we walk in and his wife

1488
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:43.40
says oh hi boys and that and I and john lewis is so nervous he goes uh it's nice nice to know you

1489
02:41:43.40 --> 02:41:49.16
and then and there's a loft and we hear this booming voice from the loft how do you know it's

1490
02:41:49.16 --> 02:41:59.000
nice to know or you just matter and so but he actually surfed uh with lord tally ho bleers

1491
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:05.72
who was the old announcer for pro surfing who was a wrestler in hawai so and tally ho bleers took

1492
02:42:05.72 --> 02:42:12.60
him to macaha like on a big day and like lobel got his front teeth knocked out and gene was terrified

1493
02:42:12.60 --> 02:42:17.000
of surfing and so like and I was surfing a lot of big waves then and I must have a picture or

1494
02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:23.08
something so I wound up at his kitchen table like talking to him it's about surfing for hours and uh

1495
02:42:23.08 --> 02:42:29.16
and he was very close to the machatos and uh I think you know john joc machado is one of the guys

1496
02:42:29.16 --> 02:42:34.84
who's impressed me as much as anyone other than hixon yeah and I've been able to train with him

1497
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:42.84
the last few years um and that's been great and he's he's a really nice guy and that's a book I'd

1498
02:42:42.84 --> 02:42:49.08
like to write what about john joc yeah because being born with judo gene the bell uh both but

1499
02:42:49.08 --> 02:42:54.76
but I think gene's a little more plays it close to the vest um but john joc born with one hand

1500
02:42:54.76 --> 02:43:01.72
and becoming you know one of the best of all time and turning a handicap into an advantage is uh

1501
02:43:01.72 --> 02:43:08.92
it's a remarkable story and he and again he's uh a great teacher did you run into the Armenian crew

1502
02:43:08.92 --> 02:43:15.32
oh yeah go-kart yeah yeah yeah this is like a whole timeline oh yeah dean and we were going up

1503
02:43:15.32 --> 02:43:21.72
there and like those guys were we we did matches in these underground places there was one place

1504
02:43:21.72 --> 02:43:28.28
called neutral grounds it was in some terrible part of uh uh la and like there was pit bulls

1505
02:43:28.28 --> 02:43:34.84
everywhere and there was no like it's just just mayhem but it's hard to explain that to people that

1506
02:43:35.40 --> 02:43:41.16
didn't live through that the pre-cambian times I thought dean killed an Armenian one time like this

1507
02:43:41.16 --> 02:43:48.04
guy these guys would not tap no I mean they were it was a life or death scenario for them oh yeah

1508
02:43:48.04 --> 02:43:54.20
and and they were I mean obviously tough as hell and and they you know they they also knew they were

1509
02:43:54.20 --> 02:43:59.72
also walking in new oh yeah they they were all linked in with judo gene labelle so there's a mayhem

1510
02:43:59.72 --> 02:44:05.72
going up there oh yeah awesome times yeah there were some there were some uh definite chaos between

1511
02:44:05.72 --> 02:44:15.40
jujitsu and I guess sombo maybe yeah at jujitsu tournaments yeah and it would be mayhem but it

1512
02:44:15.40 --> 02:44:20.60
was fun yeah a good way to start to learn things everybody got a lot better fast yeah no doubt about

1513
02:44:20.60 --> 02:44:25.32
it yeah now it's like you you got to just have an open mind with everything yeah you know you got to

1514
02:44:25.32 --> 02:44:33.24
keep that mind open um anyways man yeah a few more things oh we got more questions yeah rewind back

1515
02:44:33.24 --> 02:44:38.60
to tahiti right you're talking about the guy who was who's that guy her husband the sugar daddy oh

1516
02:44:38.60 --> 02:44:44.92
the sugar daddy from paris landed from paris brutal showed up on an ounce and started smelling the

1517
02:44:44.92 --> 02:44:53.16
sheets damn so you were just out at that point passport where is it yeah where is it that's probably

1518
02:44:53.16 --> 02:44:58.28
the most everything you've done that might have been the closest to death you've been and then back

1519
02:44:58.28 --> 02:45:03.000
to your weed uh selling days you said you didn't like to do the small stuff no only do like bigger

1520
02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:07.48
like what how does that work where would you get it from or whatever from the older guys who were

1521
02:45:07.48 --> 02:45:13.08
smuggling it okay so you had to deal with like the the older yeah but they were guys I knew from

1522
02:45:13.08 --> 02:45:18.36
surfing it was very small closed loop it wasn't and they would what sell it to you and yeah you'd

1523
02:45:18.36 --> 02:45:23.96
sell it yeah yeah basically and it didn't want exposure didn't want you know people coming to

1524
02:45:23.96 --> 02:45:30.44
my house or whatever it was just go to mcdonald's and bring in the duffel bag and they leave with

1525
02:45:30.44 --> 02:45:36.84
the duffel bag or you know usually but the crencha stuff was you'd sit on the front porch and you

1526
02:45:36.84 --> 02:45:44.76
know that was a trip like that was a whole another world what's going on there well that was um it

1527
02:45:44.76 --> 02:45:52.04
was just out in the open you know and and I had a I had a white Mustang GT and when that white

1528
02:45:52.04 --> 02:45:59.40
Mustang GT pulled up like line would form and people coming from all walks of life all ages

1529
02:45:59.40 --> 02:46:07.96
everything and and I remember once these cars came screeching up and I was like oh man it's a drive

1530
02:46:07.96 --> 02:46:17.24
by and and they get out and they just robbed the crencha high school marching band and so they have

1531
02:46:17.24 --> 02:46:24.36
sounds like a great take so they got a trombone and so they're trying to run up on on the porch of

1532
02:46:24.36 --> 02:46:30.20
the house where I am to stash the stuff and my buddy's mom comes out no no no they're not putting

1533
02:46:30.20 --> 02:46:35.56
that here so I was like get that shit out of here so then there's like 10 guys walking down the street

1534
02:46:35.56 --> 02:46:46.68
with like crencha cougars big drums and tubeless stuff like oh man yeah so I I uh the truth is

1535
02:46:46.68 --> 02:46:52.44
always stranger than fiction you know it really is and it's just you know yeah how much money you

1536
02:46:52.44 --> 02:46:58.12
when you went on your eight or nine month trip to Australia and and southeast asian what not

1537
02:46:58.68 --> 02:47:01.80
how much money do you think you had in your how much money did you have in your bank account when

1538
02:47:01.80 --> 02:47:07.96
you rolled out probably like 20 grand or something that's like more than enough yeah live forever on

1539
02:47:07.96 --> 02:47:15.32
yeah and my rent in Australia was there's like 300 Australian a month right across the street from

1540
02:47:15.32 --> 02:47:23.000
a little grass trail to broken head point and you know go to the pub and you know play pool in the

1541
02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:30.20
afternoons and yeah it was great and yeah and then the the banquet for the surf contest I was in a

1542
02:47:30.20 --> 02:47:38.44
few surf contests always had to culminate with a giant wild wild west fight and and the Bondi guys

1543
02:47:38.44 --> 02:47:43.40
were real bad asses so aunt and the Bondi guys would come up and it was the big one was the

1544
02:47:43.40 --> 02:47:50.84
sky Easter classic and so we were all in that and then then some guys from Malibu came and they

1545
02:47:50.84 --> 02:47:57.88
started slam dancing at the at the awards banquet and the Aussies thought they were fighting and it

1546
02:47:57.88 --> 02:48:05.48
turns into the gnarliest wild wild west brawl you've ever seen and um yeah and and uh one of the

1547
02:48:05.48 --> 02:48:11.40
Americans got his lips split a little bit and you know it just comes with the turf and uh

1548
02:48:11.40 --> 02:48:16.60
uh yeah no I love the Aussies uh yeah I still thought I'm still friends with all those guys yeah

1549
02:48:16.60 --> 02:48:21.96
I was lucky enough to go down there for a bit and um it was one of the places where I was like man I

1550
02:48:21.96 --> 02:48:30.28
went to damn Nusa oh yeah what the that place is ridiculous oh yeah no no but see then I started

1551
02:48:30.28 --> 02:48:37.08
going to west Australia and that's gnarly and so by then I was pretty good in jujitsu and they

1552
02:48:37.08 --> 02:48:44.44
called me the human knot and um and my friends it's like four brothers and they're the best guys at

1553
02:48:44.44 --> 02:48:49.56
Margaret River so I would stay with them but I would first have to line them all up on the lawn

1554
02:48:49.56 --> 02:48:53.96
and beat all of them just to get it over with and I would also have a mouthpiece with me

1555
02:48:53.96 --> 02:49:00.92
anytime I went out and so and they worked these are hard guys they worked all day on the black top

1556
02:49:00.92 --> 02:49:07.08
shoveling black top and uh and the father was a treasure hunter deep-sea diver and they were also

1557
02:49:07.08 --> 02:49:12.44
commercial fishermen and they come home and their little counsel worker outfits with the

1558
02:49:12.44 --> 02:49:19.64
short shorts and the one brother who was the wimpiest one but he was the natural in jujitsu

1559
02:49:19.64 --> 02:49:24.04
so suddenly he's whipping the brothers they've been kicking his ass this whole life and he's like

1560
02:49:24.04 --> 02:49:32.52
oh and he's really looks scared I go what's wrong Jay he goes well cousin Dave's a bit crook with you

1561
02:49:32.52 --> 02:49:37.40
and I'm like okay cousin Dave I don't know your cousin Dave I go what are you talking about he goes

1562
02:49:37.40 --> 02:49:42.68
well I've gone and shown him that choke and he said no seppo choke's gonna work on me so I've

1563
02:49:42.68 --> 02:49:47.64
gone and shown him but but I forgot to tell him to tap my leg and he's gone unconscious on the job

1564
02:49:47.64 --> 02:49:53.64
site and so then I'd go to these parties and like cousin Dave want to give me the king hit which is

1565
02:49:53.64 --> 02:49:59.000
the sucker punch so you're having like always keep your back to the wall and watch out for cousin Dave

1566
02:49:59.64 --> 02:50:04.12
so and then there was gentleman's night at the margarit vs board riders club which was

1567
02:50:06.04 --> 02:50:14.20
you know an endless glass of beer for three hours then the fully naked strippers and then

1568
02:50:14.20 --> 02:50:22.20
the motorcycle club crashed that party to fight with the surfers then then I and this was like a

1569
02:50:22.20 --> 02:50:27.88
normal Wednesday night no this is a big event you know yeah and so no so we're there and you know

1570
02:50:27.88 --> 02:50:33.56
stumble drunk in true Australian fashion and the whole front window shatters and they get the

1571
02:50:33.56 --> 02:50:37.72
bikies are here the bikies are here so they spill out and there's some fighting with the

1572
02:50:37.72 --> 02:50:45.56
motorcycle guys and then I'm thinking like I can't really stay vertical but if I jog slow it's a lot

1573
02:50:45.56 --> 02:50:52.20
better so I'm kind of jogging slow and and and then and then I see a cop and I'm like oh man I got

1574
02:50:52.20 --> 02:50:57.000
it that cops can get me for public drunkenness or something and then I kind of get lost and now

1575
02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.60
I'm in west Australia it's like two in the morning and then I sort of get my bearings again I'm like

1576
02:51:02.60 --> 02:51:06.60
okay and I can see where I'm staying and I'm going down the main drag of margarit river

1577
02:51:07.32 --> 02:51:15.16
and there was like a crazy Australian Vietnam vet who lived in the park and all he did was march with

1578
02:51:15.16 --> 02:51:20.76
this big staff on his head and do push-ups and body weight exercises and he was a monster

1579
02:51:20.76 --> 02:51:29.16
and and I'm lurking in the shadows and I hear this oh I see you oh see you scaredy cat come on scaredy

1580
02:51:29.16 --> 02:51:36.04
cat come out and fly and uh and I go down one block and there's like three blocks to my place where

1581
02:51:36.04 --> 02:51:41.64
I'm staying I put my mouthpiece in and I just start running and I'm like okay it's football time and he

1582
02:51:41.64 --> 02:51:48.92
didn't do anything but then I wake up the next day I'm so hungover and my wife says oh let's go out

1583
02:51:48.92 --> 02:51:56.36
breakfast it's okay yeah and I caught you're married at this point yeah so my wife's gnarly and uh

1584
02:51:56.36 --> 02:52:01.16
and so I take like two steps and run back throw up and I say I just got to go to the beach and get

1585
02:52:01.16 --> 02:52:05.40
in the water and I'll be better like just let me get in the water so you go to margarit river you

1586
02:52:05.40 --> 02:52:11.32
got to go down this long staircase and then there's a big beach with some rocks and I'm with walking

1587
02:52:11.32 --> 02:52:17.96
with my wife and I get halfway down the beach I'm like and my wife just peels off like she's never

1588
02:52:17.96 --> 02:52:23.72
seen me in my life there's like one twig I'm trying to hide under and puke and all the Aussies are up

1589
02:52:23.72 --> 02:52:29.32
on the the thing watching the whole thing and that's when they're like ah that pike's a top block

1590
02:52:29.32 --> 02:52:35.48
and that's like Australia you have to do that you know what year did you get married uh 2000

1591
02:52:35.48 --> 02:52:43.88
wait a second so this was I wasn't married yet you wasn't married yet but it was you she became

1592
02:52:43.88 --> 02:52:49.32
your wife yeah that was her that was that was her final she's like yeah that was your courting

1593
02:52:49.32 --> 02:52:54.60
process yeah and a little time at Up Wedge Island at the lobster camp she liked that a lot

1594
02:52:55.88 --> 02:53:03.16
where's she from originally south uh she's from virginia in florida but a real southerner where

1595
02:53:03.16 --> 02:53:12.36
when did you meet her uh blind eight new york city in 95 I think so again how was she what was she

1596
02:53:12.36 --> 02:53:18.12
doing down this shit was happening in Australia like I took her down there in 1995 no no this would

1597
02:53:18.12 --> 02:53:25.08
this would have been about probably 97 or eight or somewhere around then oh so you were actually a

1598
02:53:25.08 --> 02:53:32.60
grown man doing this yeah yeah I thought this was when you were 18 no no but but in Australia you

1599
02:53:32.60 --> 02:53:38.04
say oh well that was back then everybody's old now and these guys all have kids and all that and

1600
02:53:38.04 --> 02:53:42.52
then they're still down the pub oh no and then the two brothers that night went home and got in a

1601
02:53:42.52 --> 02:53:47.88
fistfight with each other on the way home and then they had to drive like four hours to Perth in

1602
02:53:47.88 --> 02:53:53.80
the car one with a black eye them not talking and the kids in the back and yeah it's the Aussie way

1603
02:53:54.84 --> 02:54:02.44
that's how we roll I guess awesome man oh thank you appreciate you coming on uh thanks for thanks

1604
02:54:02.44 --> 02:54:09.80
for joining us thanks for sharing your experiences um I'd say thanks for reminding us that life's

1605
02:54:09.80 --> 02:54:15.24
a story and and in order to write it you gotta go live it yep so good lesson for all of us

1606
02:54:15.24 --> 02:54:22.28
go out there and live thanks for joining us man thank you and with that Peter Maguire has left

1607
02:54:22.28 --> 02:54:34.12
the building Echo Charles surfing jujitsu academia genocide a lot going on in there yeah definitely

1608
02:54:34.84 --> 02:54:41.80
an interesting path and and it's a good thing to remember that when you're on a path you can step

1609
02:54:41.80 --> 02:54:45.88
off that path and go in a different direction yeah you know this isn't I'm not talking about the

1610
02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:51.40
I'm not talking about the path right capital T capital P yeah yeah we don't want to let's say

1611
02:54:51.40 --> 02:54:57.80
you could be going down one lane of the road and you could get off and go down a different lane

1612
02:54:58.68 --> 02:55:03.24
and it was kind of hard to convey this but a lot of this stuff was happening in Peter's life was

1613
02:55:03.24 --> 02:55:07.56
happening at the same time he's doing jujitsu he's going to Cambodia he's writing about this

1614
02:55:07.56 --> 02:55:12.20
he's still a prophet like he did a lot a lot of this stuff was he was living it was happening

1615
02:55:12.20 --> 02:55:21.08
parallel in his life so that is definitely something to remember it sometimes I think people feel stuck

1616
02:55:21.08 --> 02:55:27.24
in a rut and the reason they feel stuck in a rut is because they're staying in the rut that they're

1617
02:55:27.24 --> 02:55:32.92
in and you don't have to sacrifice everything to go and you know put another toe in the water over

1618
02:55:32.92 --> 02:55:38.60
here test the waters over there you know you can you can go and try to do two class you can go and

1619
02:55:38.60 --> 02:55:44.44
take a guitar class you can go and do some research about something that you don't know much about

1620
02:55:44.44 --> 02:55:47.64
you can go and interview people that's what does it cost to interview somebody doesn't cost anything

1621
02:55:47.64 --> 02:55:54.52
go learn yeah a lot of opportunity out there man I was so surfing is one of those things

1622
02:55:54.52 --> 02:55:58.60
jujitsu is like this too but surfing is a big one and you see you know you see movies about this

1623
02:55:58.60 --> 02:56:03.80
or whatever right the even idea of the endless summer right where you're chasing like essentially

1624
02:56:03.80 --> 02:56:09.08
you're chasing waves right you can go ahead and say it what point break point break okay so that's

1625
02:56:09.08 --> 02:56:14.20
what I that's what I uh basically compared in my mind right because point break is essentially

1626
02:56:14.20 --> 02:56:19.72
parts of it anyway right essentially instead of smuggling drugs but exactly right you know but

1627
02:56:19.72 --> 02:56:24.84
it's the same gig you know where it's like I'm just gonna make as much money as I can as fast as I

1628
02:56:24.84 --> 02:56:29.72
can so I don't have to work right right even though he was working all the jobs but still the idea is

1629
02:56:29.72 --> 02:56:34.36
there where they'll rob all the banks and do all this and then just surf and skydive and stuff the

1630
02:56:34.36 --> 02:56:39.80
rest of time and that's kind of the dream right or you just join the teams yeah but here's here's the

1631
02:56:39.80 --> 02:56:44.36
here's the point with that and actually you're right though you're right where if you go around the

1632
02:56:44.36 --> 02:56:50.92
world chasing waves where you you'll just by incident find yourself in different interesting

1633
02:56:50.92 --> 02:56:57.88
situations where you'll learn new things meet new people have all these like varying levels of

1634
02:56:57.88 --> 02:57:03.000
craziness experiences and then that builds on itself right you know you know how you like one

1635
02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.24
experience with this experience put together it's like oh that's also and jujitsu is like that as

1636
02:57:07.24 --> 02:57:11.56
well where but most people don't travel around just doing jujitsu sometimes you do sometimes you

1637
02:57:11.56 --> 02:57:16.20
do and actually I had that experience on a small degree when I was traveling around doing filming

1638
02:57:16.20 --> 02:57:21.96
jujitsu yeah but I was I would train too so that's how I met at that time all the main guys and they'd

1639
02:57:21.96 --> 02:57:26.04
be like yeah come train because I'd be purple belt and brown belt so it's like the perfect guy for

1640
02:57:26.04 --> 02:57:33.08
them to train with because I'm usually their size or whatever not good enough you know so it's easy

1641
02:57:33.08 --> 02:57:37.80
to it's kind of they can beat me up at the same time and then give me the experience of their gym

1642
02:57:37.80 --> 02:57:41.80
and all this stuff it's like hospitality thing it was perfect yeah and so I got that turn freaking

1643
02:57:41.80 --> 02:57:47.56
everybody that is a good thing and then you get all these experiences and now you know them oh you

1644
02:57:47.56 --> 02:57:51.48
know how he knew all these people you're like Eric Paul's in you know like all these people and he

1645
02:57:51.48 --> 02:57:55.96
knew them all but it's because of that same concept where he's like he's going around chasing waves

1646
02:57:55.96 --> 02:58:01.40
you know oh Hickson's here okay I'll take a jujitsu class or whatever and I'm gonna meet this guy

1647
02:58:01.40 --> 02:58:06.84
now I know this guy you know it's kind of crazy how many like that for one level of connection to

1648
02:58:06.84 --> 02:58:12.04
John Donahur and then John Donahur to Dean Lister and we got Judo Jeevan Lebel you got Eric Paul

1649
02:58:12.04 --> 02:58:18.04
like all these are these guys are the premier people that brought the sport to what it is you

1650
02:58:18.04 --> 02:58:25.16
know I mean I mean obviously you've got Hickson and Horian and Alio like for sure but then you have

1651
02:58:25.16 --> 02:58:32.44
all like the second gen people that were coming up and it's just it's just interesting how it's all

1652
02:58:32.44 --> 02:58:38.52
connected and it seems I guess it seems more interesting to me because jujitsu is such a

1653
02:58:38.52 --> 02:58:43.24
big part of my world you know takes up a big part of my world takes up a big part of your world

1654
02:58:43.24 --> 02:58:54.44
and but still like the connection between like John Donahur, Henzel Gracie, Hickson Gracie,

1655
02:58:55.32 --> 02:59:05.80
Peter Maguire, Gene Lebel like it's just wildness it's wildness so I say you know I heard this some

1656
02:59:05.80 --> 02:59:09.64
expression about like if you want to be a writer well what's the best thing you do if you want to

1657
02:59:09.64 --> 02:59:15.24
be a writer go live oh yeah that's a great advice you want to be a writer go live somebody asked me

1658
02:59:15.24 --> 02:59:21.88
yesterday when was I oh yeah when we were up yesterday I got asked um you know oh did you

1659
02:59:21.88 --> 02:59:28.68
always want to be a writer I'm like nope now I've written I think 11 books but I didn't quote

1660
02:59:28.68 --> 02:59:34.68
like I was like oh I'm gonna be a writer yeah I just was gonna be a commando and then happened

1661
02:59:34.68 --> 02:59:39.64
to happen to start writing but that's a good it's not a bad and I'm not saying you have to be a commando

1662
02:59:39.64 --> 02:59:45.64
but maybe you're gonna be of a damn jujitsu player or maybe you're gonna be a surfer or maybe you're

1663
02:59:45.64 --> 02:59:51.88
gonna be anything go out and be something you have something to write about at least yeah take a

1664
02:59:51.88 --> 02:59:56.76
little bit of risk too what was that quote he said about being careful careful careful get you killed

1665
02:59:56.76 --> 03:00:04.12
careful get you killed yeah yeah careful kills careful kills but also careful prevents life prevents

1666
03:00:04.12 --> 03:00:12.28
living and look I'm not saying obviously go out and do dumb shit but don't but don't let caution

1667
03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:16.12
guide your every move where you don't take risk you gotta take risks because you're gonna be out

1668
03:00:16.12 --> 03:00:24.12
there getting after it no look does it is it smart to smuggle pot no it's not but is it smart to

1669
03:00:24.12 --> 03:00:28.20
hey I don't have too much money but I got enough money to get down the you know down to Indonesia

1670
03:00:28.20 --> 03:00:34.28
I'm gonna go surfing oh cool you know don't do dummy legal shit but man roll the dice a little

1671
03:00:34.28 --> 03:00:39.16
bit go get after it a little bit yeah it's gonna be good for you yeah it's almost like within a

1672
03:00:39.16 --> 03:00:46.12
certain certain threshold it's like you that's the best thing you can actually do for yourself

1673
03:00:46.12 --> 03:00:51.000
within reasons so sure if you would look at and be like hey this is dumb this is a dumb move you

1674
03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:57.80
know illegal stuff mainly like falls within that category whatever um then okay that's exclude

1675
03:00:57.80 --> 03:01:03.24
that everything else should kind of be in play anyway when you think about it seriously yeah

1676
03:01:03.80 --> 03:01:08.52
and between the and of course on on one superficial and you got a cool story that's on the super

1677
03:01:08.52 --> 03:01:12.60
but like all the stuff you learn whether you're successful or not it's like by the stuff you

1678
03:01:12.60 --> 03:01:17.72
learn you'd be surprised how valuable that ends up becoming yep go get some experience go live a

1679
03:01:17.72 --> 03:01:22.12
little bit that's the recommendation but the other thing it's a rumour is it's not too you know you

1680
03:01:22.12 --> 03:01:26.60
can be I'm 50 I still need to go out there and get after a little bit more I need to take a little

1681
03:01:26.60 --> 03:01:33.48
bit more chances in the world I will say and maybe maybe you disagree but I would say it gets harder

1682
03:01:33.48 --> 03:01:39.32
and harder though as you get a you know take on more uh fixed responsibility that is true that's

1683
03:01:39.32 --> 03:01:43.80
a hundred percent true from a financial thing but I'm not even and also in other ways it comes easier

1684
03:01:44.36 --> 03:01:49.24
because now you got money like remember when you had no money yeah and you you know you were working

1685
03:01:49.24 --> 03:01:55.16
as a whatever I almost feel like and maybe I guess it depends on the circumstance but I almost feel

1686
03:01:55.16 --> 03:02:00.36
like when you have no money it kind of pushes you to have to do more stuff you know so if you have

1687
03:02:00.36 --> 03:02:04.60
money I'll just pay for it just whatever whatever whatever kind of a thing where it's like things

1688
03:02:04.60 --> 03:02:09.80
will come a lot easier and I thought about this too where you know how like when you think back to

1689
03:02:09.80 --> 03:02:13.80
the times when you don't make any money it's like what what was the difference because 20 years I was

1690
03:02:13.80 --> 03:02:19.40
in the Navy but think about it there are certain parts of life it's funny I say that but you know

1691
03:02:19.40 --> 03:02:23.08
what I at the time and you've heard me say this like I was a richest guy in the world

1692
03:02:23.08 --> 03:02:27.56
me and my friends in the games we thought we were the richest guys in the world we had so much money

1693
03:02:27.56 --> 03:02:33.64
young single team guy dude e5 frog man gets on in your position too you get a lot of stuff paid for

1694
03:02:33.64 --> 03:02:40.04
right by the you know like well wet suits right yeah a lot of the front shoots bro yeah and that's a

1695
03:02:40.04 --> 03:02:46.84
huge deal guns ammo yeah what people would want to spend money on yeah you get a batteries toilet paper

1696
03:02:46.84 --> 03:02:52.76
oh yeah right so that's literally my buddy had to free went to his house you know like the

1697
03:02:52.76 --> 03:02:57.88
big industrial toilet paper rolls that are like a foot across that's what they had in the seal

1698
03:02:57.88 --> 03:03:04.36
teams and this dude had it at his house outside pro you're a savage wasn't even a papers on toilet

1699
03:03:04.36 --> 03:03:10.76
paper taking a freaking roll of that roll probably lasts like six months here's the thing well here's

1700
03:03:10.76 --> 03:03:15.24
the thing and actually which is part of the fraud wastes and abuse by the way fraud wastes and

1701
03:03:15.24 --> 03:03:21.24
abuse is though those things in life cost money and if you don't have a lot of money like certain

1702
03:03:21.24 --> 03:03:26.60
parts little little tiny parts of life that all are and there's a lot of them too a lot of them

1703
03:03:26.60 --> 03:03:32.68
every day all day those little parts of life are hard it's like they're so hard that you're taking

1704
03:03:32.68 --> 03:03:37.88
toilet paper from the yeah you know guys batteries batteries there's kind of an unlimited supply of

1705
03:03:37.88 --> 03:03:44.36
batteries in the seal teams oh yeah uh oh yeah any kind of rigors tape like what what do you call a

1706
03:03:44.36 --> 03:03:49.56
gaff tape sure yeah that stuff you go to guys you go to a team guys house there's a freaking

1707
03:03:49.56 --> 03:03:55.56
pretty good there's a box of rigors tape just in case some 550 cord some one inch two be the

1708
03:03:55.56 --> 03:04:02.92
nylon yep so think about this let's say let's say you don't get free rigors tape and toilet paper

1709
03:04:02.92 --> 03:04:08.76
and you have hotels oh yeah places to stay like these are pretty like per diem if you have if you

1710
03:04:08.76 --> 03:04:12.84
have money or you get that stuff free it's kind of like it makes it things so much easier but it

1711
03:04:12.84 --> 03:04:17.80
keeps you in a little bit more of a box than if you didn't so let's say this i'm a jujitsu bomb

1712
03:04:17.80 --> 03:04:23.40
surf bomb whatever i don't have like i don't tell weed i don't rob banks i have normal uh i have to

1713
03:04:23.40 --> 03:04:28.28
get a normal job i don't have that much money but i want to go to australia first off i'm not flying

1714
03:04:28.28 --> 03:04:34.28
first class in this cozy thing and no one bothering me i'm i might even write in the cargo part and

1715
03:04:34.28 --> 03:04:38.44
then have a good story or whatever but in you being coach or whatever you're gonna meet some weird

1716
03:04:38.44 --> 03:04:43.48
dude or maybe you know or maybe some weird girl or something like this right then you go to australia

1717
03:04:43.48 --> 03:04:48.04
and now you got to search for a place to stay it's not taking care of many adventures you know

1718
03:04:48.04 --> 03:04:52.84
exactly right many adventures because you gotta you gotta like make do you got to struggle for

1719
03:04:52.84 --> 03:04:57.08
everything and and it becomes more of a thing if you have money you're just like yeah you probably

1720
03:04:57.08 --> 03:05:01.000
don't even book it you're like hey can you just book me in that hotel just choose the nicest one

1721
03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:05.40
or kind of a thing so you don't have a story behind that you're safe in the hotel you're safe in your

1722
03:05:05.40 --> 03:05:09.24
box you see i'm saying if you'd have money you're out there earning every little teeny tiny thing so

1723
03:05:09.24 --> 03:05:18.28
you have way more of a experience seem saying embrace it risky too yeah all right well hey take

1724
03:05:18.28 --> 03:05:23.08
some chances go out there if you want to support the podcast you want to support yourself you want

1725
03:05:23.08 --> 03:05:29.80
to get stronger faster better smarter get yourself some jockel fuel new flavors in discipline go

1726
03:05:29.80 --> 03:05:35.16
discipline go new flavors get yourself some moke i need some moke right now bro yeah and

1727
03:05:35.16 --> 03:05:39.48
brah how's this and i'm with you right and you know how like you know kind when you get you know

1728
03:05:39.48 --> 03:05:44.92
when you get hungry and then like even like a normal chocolate bar or something seems like oh

1729
03:05:44.92 --> 03:05:51.08
like wait you know just when you get real hungry bro i i mixed banana moke and chocolate moke

1730
03:05:51.08 --> 03:05:54.92
and i put some chocolate milk in it just because i like you know how everything sounds good to you

1731
03:05:54.92 --> 03:05:59.000
is what i'm saying so i was like oh yeah i put some banana in there whatever and probably it was

1732
03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:03.48
really really good i don't know if it's because i was so hungry or because that could be a banana

1733
03:06:03.48 --> 03:06:07.08
chocolate is good it's a thing wait it was a chocolate peanut butter so that made sense think

1734
03:06:07.08 --> 03:06:11.24
about it you chop up a banana put some peanut butter on it i mean in real life not moke

1735
03:06:12.12 --> 03:06:16.68
and then put a little bit of chocolate on there come on bro that's good it's the same flavor is

1736
03:06:16.68 --> 03:06:22.84
what i'm saying yeah so yeah moke get yourself some moke that way you do it's just so good especially

1737
03:06:22.84 --> 03:06:29.88
like like i'm saying right now so it's pretty standard that when that we are here when we're

1738
03:06:29.88 --> 03:06:35.64
recording i haven't eaten yeah so have you eaten today no so we're both on a fast right now yeah

1739
03:06:35.64 --> 03:06:41.08
it all sounds good i'm gonna break the fast with like some mixed nuts and some moke when i get

1740
03:06:41.08 --> 03:06:45.80
done with this little scenario so i recommend you do the same thing get yourself some moke get

1752
03:07:46.68 --> 03:07:53.08

1753
03:07:53.08 --> 03:08:00.52
at home or wherever wherever you go and just thought to yourself i wish i was like doing

1754
03:08:00.52 --> 03:08:04.36
jiu-jitsu right now yes and not the kind where it's like oh i wish i was doing something else

1755
03:08:04.36 --> 03:08:09.16
jiu-jitsu sounds fun so that i'm you're like the feeling of man i wish i was actually like

1756
03:08:09.96 --> 03:08:15.32
doing jiu-jitsu with someone right now you know what i had the feeling similar feeling but like

1757
03:08:15.32 --> 03:08:20.60
so dean's had an injured hand because he broke his hand for like a couple months right and you know

1758
03:08:20.60 --> 03:08:25.40
so when whenever we're training there's a little bit of a little bit of hold back right a little

1759
03:08:25.40 --> 03:08:31.48
bit of oh hey you know hey switch arms hey switch positions hey oh hold on you know that kind of

1760
03:08:31.48 --> 03:08:36.84
hurt that kind of thing and like the other day we actually like he i had forgotten he'd hurt in his

1761
03:08:36.84 --> 03:08:40.44
hand because he's been hit he's at all taped up you know so when you're rolling you just see this

1762
03:08:40.44 --> 03:08:45.32
taped up thing and then i was gone for a little few days i come back he didn't put the tape on

1763
03:08:45.32 --> 03:08:52.28
because it's healing and it's weird just rolling and when we got done he said something like you

1764
03:08:52.28 --> 03:08:57.24
know my hand felt pretty good today i was like oh i didn't even remember it but the roll was so fun

1765
03:08:57.24 --> 03:09:02.68
because it was like the limits were off yeah i knew it was just like felt so good yeah so yes

1766
03:09:02.68 --> 03:09:08.52
sometimes you got to train that jiu-jitsu yes yeah fully you ever and this is not a judgmental thing

1767
03:09:08.52 --> 03:09:14.52
by any means but you ever um you ever think about yourself before you knew jiu-jitsu and

1768
03:09:14.52 --> 03:09:19.64
been like man i felt like that was almost like an empty shell version of myself you ever think that

1769
03:09:20.36 --> 03:09:26.04
you feel like you were not enlightened yes you feel like there was just a whole thing it was all a

1770
03:09:26.04 --> 03:09:30.68
lot a lot of it too was like a lie but what's there's another word what is the word like the buddhist

1771
03:09:30.68 --> 03:09:36.60
used to say is an illusion you were in i was a little bit of an illusion because there's a lot

1772
03:09:36.60 --> 03:09:42.44
of things that you think that are wrong yeah just he just a straight up even even just the

1773
03:09:42.44 --> 03:09:48.20
pragmatic things like i think i can beat this person up and you don't know jiu-jitsu you think

1774
03:09:48.20 --> 03:09:51.72
that but it's an illusion yeah because you may or may i sure you might be able to but you also

1775
03:09:51.72 --> 03:09:57.24
might not be able to yeah so there's a whole illusion to your life when you're not doing jiu-jitsu

1776
03:09:57.24 --> 03:10:03.88
and that's a problem yes and this is you're actually suit absolutely correct and you're

1777
03:10:03.88 --> 03:10:08.92
you know more about what i was just said than i do actually because now that you say that i remember

1778
03:10:08.92 --> 03:10:12.44
yes that's correct because i was a bouncer in hawaii before i started jiu-jitsu oh yeah you thought

1779
03:10:12.44 --> 03:10:15.64
you were the bad and i i never really thought i was bad because i worked with a bunch of big

1780
03:10:15.64 --> 03:10:21.48
someone guys so i did not think i was a badass but yeah probably yeah probably related to him

1781
03:10:22.20 --> 03:10:26.68
but i didn't think i was a badass in that group but compared to the patrons that would act up and

1782
03:10:26.68 --> 03:10:32.04
stuff i did but i think of myself back then i was like almost like there was this big part of my

1783
03:10:32.04 --> 03:10:37.80
brain that was just empty not knowing unknowing you know so yes not enlightened exactly right did

1784
03:10:37.80 --> 03:10:43.16
you see they're making apparently they're making a remake of roadhouse yes yes you're fired up for

1785
03:10:43.16 --> 03:10:48.36
that the pisses me off it doesn't piss me off but i just i know it's gonna be lame well it's connor

1786
03:10:48.36 --> 03:10:55.40
McGregor so what what what who's connor McGregor he's he's in it he's slayed it given what i've been

1787
03:10:55.40 --> 03:10:59.08
sent and you know it's funny you're the third person now to to bring actually oh yeah because

1788
03:10:59.08 --> 03:11:03.24
everybody knows you're in they've been sending me the stuff yeah and so connor McGregor's gonna be in

1789
03:11:03.24 --> 03:11:09.88
it playing what role well the online stuff that people sent me um had a picture of connor McGregor

1790
03:11:09.88 --> 03:11:15.32
to be in roadhouse okay that's different he's gonna be in it he's gonna have a bit role that's cool

1791
03:11:15.32 --> 03:11:21.32
no i think he's the guy but i don't know i didn't i didn't use dalton that's what i think no i don't

1792
03:11:21.32 --> 03:11:26.60
know i didn't look at that bro a bunch of people just been sending it to me and then people have

1793
03:11:26.60 --> 03:11:30.76
been bringing it up to there's a lot of roles that connor McGregor would be awesome at dalton's not

1794
03:11:30.76 --> 03:11:35.08
one of them in my opinion i don't know you think so i don't i have no idea i think he'd be better

1795
03:11:35.08 --> 03:11:41.40
as the as the protagonist in that the protag the antagonist yeah yeah i think he'd be a better bad

1796
03:11:41.40 --> 03:11:46.92
guy the dude that gets his throat ripped out remember the og one well well here's the thing so

1797
03:11:48.12 --> 03:11:54.28
my fantasy of a roadhouse remake would be a super dark and greedy one not like kind of cheesy like

1798
03:11:54.28 --> 03:12:01.72
dark with drugs and like a real um explicit that was my og fantasy then i found out later that ronda

1799
03:12:01.72 --> 03:12:10.04
rousey in her heyday was slated as dalton as a remake of roadhouse where you know it's a woman

1800
03:12:10.04 --> 03:12:14.20
protagonist that's what i that's the intel i got that's what back in the day was a long time ago

1801
03:12:14.84 --> 03:12:21.80
and then yes recently maybe that's why because my vision of roadhouse was more like an actual

1802
03:12:21.80 --> 03:12:27.24
fighter guy yeah and maybe it was just embedded in my brain and you don't see women bouncers so it's

1803
03:12:27.24 --> 03:12:32.20
like that's i think a big time a mistake when you're trying to sell a certain story and it's like

1804
03:12:32.20 --> 03:12:38.12
okay let's put like a different person in that role that it's like bruh that's not that realistic

1805
03:12:38.12 --> 03:12:43.88
as a woman bouncer they're so rare so unless it's about the rarity of women bouncers cool but it's

1806
03:12:43.88 --> 03:12:49.64
like it's not as believable you know you know how like you get like a um like a like if you get a

1807
03:12:49.64 --> 03:12:56.76
ninja will say but the ninja is a 10 year old boy it's like i see what you're doing but it's like

1808
03:12:56.76 --> 03:13:03.56
bad ninjas aren't 10 year old boys typically ninjas is like a trained decades of training guy that's

1809
03:13:03.56 --> 03:13:08.36
who we're gonna be you see what i'm saying anyway so when i saw khanan migreger i was like hey i i

1810
03:13:08.36 --> 03:13:13.64
feel like that's viable that's what i thought i think character wise i think you would have more fun

1811
03:13:13.64 --> 03:13:20.68
playing like a bad guy i think you're right i think you're the antagonist because even though

1812
03:13:20.68 --> 03:13:26.12
he's good he's that good at talking smack he's kind of good he's kind of good at being a bad guy

1813
03:13:26.68 --> 03:13:34.12
in mma but also has like the good side right they love him he's not just a pure heal you know what

1814
03:13:34.12 --> 03:13:40.04
they term heal is right from wrestling like like chael sonan was duty he was you know bad guy

1815
03:13:40.04 --> 03:13:48.84
ink bro and he was so good at it and and connor plays that role a little bit but he's not but

1816
03:13:48.84 --> 03:13:54.68
he still does it with like a nice side and he has a lot of you know a lot of positivity to him

1817
03:13:55.48 --> 03:14:00.68
and so if he was allowed to just go off and just be bad he'd have a good time with it well here's

1818
03:14:00.68 --> 03:14:07.000
the thing and and i didn't realize this until it was actually like told to me where the i felt it

1819
03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:11.88
but i never knew this as a specific thing so the best bad guys in history are guys that we like

1820
03:14:12.44 --> 03:14:17.40
like guys who are we're like hey sure he's a bad guy but oh i kind of want to be like him

1821
03:14:17.40 --> 03:14:23.48
and that always has to have a positive element to it like darth vader um like they're they're usually

1822
03:14:23.48 --> 03:14:28.36
like guys who are like sure they're all you know you just gave you just gave me a list of one

1823
03:14:30.84 --> 03:14:36.20
you started counting your fingers too like you're gonna have at least five give me a list of one

1824
03:14:36.20 --> 03:14:41.48
and it's freaking darth vader good job he was the first guy that came to all right uh well you tell

1825
03:14:41.48 --> 03:14:49.24
me who who's who's like an iconic bad guy anton sugar okay uh yeah okay so stoicism he's stoic

1826
03:14:49.24 --> 03:14:56.52
dude right in touch with or able to control his emotions super successful like there's all these

1827
03:14:56.52 --> 03:15:00.68
elements of him that are like and then there's one or two really i mean they're significant but this

1828
03:15:00.68 --> 03:15:05.80
is usually just one or two bad elements of them and in fact you get bad guys who some some

1829
03:15:05.80 --> 03:15:11.32
movies they do on purpose and they do it well where if they want you to really not like a bad guy

1830
03:15:11.32 --> 03:15:16.84
like they'll make him like kind of weasley or someone who like you wouldn't want to like listen

1831
03:15:16.84 --> 03:15:21.08
to her hang out with in fact you'd really rather be quiet and not show up to the party kind of a

1832
03:15:21.08 --> 03:15:26.84
thing but usually the good bad guys you're like oh as long as he liked me i would like to hang out

1833
03:15:26.84 --> 03:15:31.08
with that guy or be like that guy when you think about it so you get a conor mcgregor as the bad
