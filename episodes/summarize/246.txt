And it's awesome and the cool thing is like these the first ones use the pilot program that people are gonna be able to you know Be a part of it's like being a part of like muster zero zero one like those are plank owners and people are gonna be Plank owners of the individual FTX's You know we were talking last night, you know You're dinner table about the two different tiers that we know that we're gonna definitely do one like I said It's just the the two full days of training and it's just gonna be Run after run after run after run after run I mean you can be you're gonna have so many runs like somebody's gonna say Hey, I'm gonna have to sit this one out and somebody's listening. I can like jump and like slide out like I need to be able to get out like Whoever like they've got they've got me pinned down like they've got their bead well done Take mark on your side for now like like I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna get out of this situation and then I hear A very familiar sound that usually brings a lot of comfort To me and it was Mikey and one of the other machine gunners just Bupupupupupupupupupupupup like they're seeing it off each other and then you hear all the other guy shooting So there's a gunfight going on however that gunfight's not in front of the courtyard they were Down the alleyway they had left me like I Insultly realized that I'd been left behind on that target and I knew that I had to get out of the room But and it was clear But what was not clear to me was when you're actually in that situation because there is some gray zones there There is some like you know like once you're in a situation it kind of changes like How you can interpret something and I know and our leadership had always made it very clear and I knew just knew that if If you shoot somebody That was not in any combat and fighter that was not within the rules of engagement You're gonna be going to jail All right like I'm gonna be going to Levinworth to make big rocks to medium rocks to make medium rocks to small rocks Like that's not gonna be good like you can't just shoot people without them having a weapon or doing a hostile act or something That's within your rules of engagement and so we were setting up an Overwatch and I was lead sniper and I'm scanning my area It's like it's the worst because like what if what if like they didn't say anything They just like okay jpe's back, but then you kind of sense just a little bit of you know Like they're a little bit short with you or something like that it's like that's like an added double triple torture right there and then you told me like and then life comes up and he has his big smile He's like you good to go like yes, sir Then you guys are laughing you're like we were Jocco was joking about how we should just let you sleep until you woke up and just to see like what you would do Remember just the thought of that was like I don't know what I if I would have just kept sleeping and then woken up at like Whenever I don't know three o'clock in the afternoon for the closing of the buster I probably would have just gone straight to the airport right here's my two week notice It's been real thanks guys. and I just remember it's like thinking like man I really need to make this work with echelon front like I really need to make sure I'm doing what I need to do and not just like Make it work like hey, I'm available for work like do you have opportunity like let me know what I need A lot of my marriage to fall apart, but It's still always been there that's kept you know, just me reminded like hey Your your individual actions matter and that's one of the things I've always tried to Remind myself of the opportunity that I've had with with you and life here at echelon front is I need Every one of my Actions needs to impact the team for the greater good and you know, I'm and I would always have this little joke like hey everything's a test Like everything is a test with joccal life like hey, you don't know like I choose to remember that smile How he would come up and he would just like he would always like and it's like slap me on the back and kind of grab my trap and just like Just a little shake and you're just like you such a strong powerful guy when you do that you're like Okay, you know, but You know I mean people are solving problems for each other people ask a question and there's 20 responses and so that's what that next tier is gonna be like is where they're gonna come in We're gonna have that you know how the group dinner morning PT's day of runs dinner morning PT Day of runs and then like a kind of like a final like recapping everything of Of of of round table and that might be that might be a three three and a half day type of Situation but for the individual program, you know people go to echelon front.com And I am so mad at myself Like I am so upset with myself and disappointed and I said well you just screwed up the best thing you ever had Because I'm like this joc was gonna fire me I didn't know like you know like because I also understand there is no Slack with what we do it's been made very clear like hey, we don't miss events We don't drink on the road with clients. and I know you you said it was like is there anything like The VA like you were like concerned because you knew like I was having some issues with with my brain and Just my ability to focus and headaches and and sleeping and and stuff like that He's just more reserved on it and I I had kind of talked about like what about like You know different like signature flavor like you know kind of like one for me or other people would you guys be open to it? and I think he could have come in and be like Hey, this is what we're gonna be doing like hey, I had a talk with Dr. alcohol life and I would have been like Roger that sir Like the check like I know my place. and I would I would make it to where like Even like if I didn't I I wanted to be able to do it to where I if I couldn't see the advanced slide like I would practice different ways Where the computer was behind me like representing the screen and I would I would I would do that and I would get into my little rhythm of like Hey, as you can see to make sure I was still on the right slide Practice using reflections off of like pictures or mirrors and stuff to see where I was at on stuff behind me Just try to put myself in bad situations so that I could go through it We're in no choice but there's that little gray area where it's like man to optimize like Just ask for a little bit of help and you might be able to optimize not to say that's always gonna be a situation But then exactly what you said you kind of got to wrestle with Someone like you would you wouldn't be like you would take it as a personal failure like I shouldn't I shouldn't and this is a good thing by the way I shouldn't have to ask for any help ever unless I'm about to drown otherwise it's not their problem. So I was kind of like talking through and I was like hey, I'm a small business Like this is like part of my business and like it's like oh wave at this time. Yeah That makes sense to me like how you especially with your personality But even like without necessarily your specific personality like you don't want to like as a team member enthusiastic new team member and you have that like kind of attitude or whatever like non That's how I'd fit in on the team and set of focusing on being The best version of who I am being who God created like God created me a certain way I have a certain personality You know, I am I am made the way I am made for a reason Just like you're made the way you are for a reason you've been made able to Figure out exactly what makes you the most effective and you capitalize on that just like life has just like Dave has just like all the other members of the Eshelon front team are have or they're learning to do right and so at that point I had there's there's plenty of options for me to go out I'm saying you didn't act you weren't actually drowning no, you know, but what I'm saying is if if there's someone listening right now That's like drowning then you ask then you have to ask for help and you know what man I have had friends mutual friends of ours people that we know People that you don't know that I mean, you know whatever I've had plenty of friends that have come to me and been like hey man This is what's going on hey maybe you know Just the event something happened with the event like hey, maybe they had a part of that just to see how you would do Obviously we know that's not the fact, but it was just just to allow us and allow myself to not You know fall to complacency You know, I've talked about this in the mustard and we've all taught you know complacency gets people killed And complacency is something that we have to actually go to war with every single day because it creeps in you that Alarm clock goes off the complacency is gonna creep in it is gonna creep in in your professional life Your personal life your relationship with your wife or your husband your significant other You know we had no kitchen because that I mean we had a kitchen we had no dining room area because that's where the office was We would eat in the living room on TV trays like you know that was where we'd have our family dinner Like we didn't actually sit at a table and less we went over to our in-laws and so I would be practicing my keynote 46 hours a day Legitimately like going through it listening to lace Keynote clicking along like making it my own kind of doing some tweaks talking with you in life here and and So I was you know doing what I could and I met this I met these brothers at a shooting course that I did and they're like hey if you ever do like your own like we love to do is like in it like Just some Specific specialized training with you Okay, you know, I thought I was pretty aggressive, but hey all right, but you explain like I need you Like it's just getting stuff done like I need you to you know help set that I need you to help you know just this task unit And so we kind of told him like hey, this is what we need and they're like what we can't do anything like we start at seven And the guy in the guy said okay, we we've Rented out this many rooms for this many days like this needs to happen and the front desk lady was like and And I'm like trying to figure out like I need to get out of the room like I'm trying to time it I'm like well if I maybe if I get on my stomach I can get it like a sprinter's position. It'll be three days You know it'll be With with that group of 30 30 or less and you know, it'll be one day of You know there'll be like round table discussions getting to know the unique differences of the different businesses that Talking through the different problems that people are going through and actually diving deep into their principles and and addressing it with a group and having All the different individuals that are there actually contributing to Like the leadership principles that we talk about and solve because as you see from EF online I mean you look at the chat. You're like you good like yes, they're I was like I'm I don't what happened I was like I'm he's like a good just make sure good. No, it wasn't because there there's gray areas And even the idea of like hey if you shoot the wrong person you're going to prison like that's actually not true and You know civilians We'll get killed in combat unintentionally and if you if mistakes like that are gonna happen and that doesn't mean your chain of command is gonna hang you out to dry You're gonna get sent to prison. He would let me set up shooting courses and hunting hunting rifles down at his family's farm for nothing Because I was like hey man, I was like we could split the cost I can pay you guys it's like man my dad just likes having you around down here I'm like okay, you know, he's that So I'm like man, this is amazing so we shoot a little bit more well he doesn't tell the guy Like my background like in the guy was like the suit first time shooting this guy on my guy You just you know It's an awesome facility that they have done there things didn't work out between us because of my lack of Proper communication with him You know, I I dropped the ball on that and so then I was solely doing my own thing I was teaching shooting I was citing in people's hunting rifles for I was just doing anything I could for extra money like doing construction Repairing fences in the neighborhood for the landlord to help like go towards my rent and you know, and then I got the call to From a team guy buddy of ours Kevin Cap and he was like hey, what are you doing the summer? yes and I told him like hey anything that I can join Jock on life like I'm available just if you can just give me more than like a next day travel heads up like we're good to go You know, she was she's been so amazing from the get go and so helpful We can't just take kids back to the United States with us to provide safety and security But you know, it's just something that's all I've always kind of thought about is my worst day is somebody's dream Like the things that we can complain about People would love to have those Those problems and so that was just another reminder that I have to myself and like hey like your life's not bad Man you live in America You know, you have a house. but and you know how like Especially if Like the ideally you want to be the team player that's like the easiest to work with and then of course The one that executes and does a good job for sure, but what if like what if your team member that you executed well?
