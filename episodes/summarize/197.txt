what you can step up and win And how about when if you can know all the right things to do but if you lack the fortitude and discipline To do it this you're it does like how many doctors know all the right things about health and yet maybe are not in great shape So they know the things to do but they don't do this as I'm saying kind of thing Maybe don't see this very often anymore, but like doctors that smoke Well now I guess you just get doctors that eat crap right horrible, There's a reason why the guys in Vietnam taught us to do that Because as long as you know what your fields of firearm you can you can go hot if you're in an L shaped Ambush or you're in an L shaped assault the minute I put people You know whether it's 270 degrees around the target or 360 degrees I can't I now I have to worry about my backdrop and it's a real problem and you know what you can get away with those You can get away with enveloping a target all day long as long as there's no shooting but the minute the enemy starts shooting It's a problem So there are ways to cover exits from an L You extend that a little bit you can put some overwatches in But it is a real problem to think that you're gonna develop a target in a small you know Let's say with with direct fire weapons Company size or smaller. And It might be the worst decision sometimes no decision while I watch things develop You might be the right call but let's be clear no decision is a decision What I've been trying to teach people lately Is like a standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do Here's the standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do you Look at what the situation where you take you did that you take a step back you look at what's unfolding Then you make the smallest Decision in the area that you guess is the right direction to move I was just reading a note from a friend of mine A team guy who's who's grandfather was in World War II still life gonna get him on the podcast and When he did the island campaign And then went into like Japan surrender after the bombs and the Japanese were told on your gun in placements put a white flag Like so Americans were sailing in like the wars over sailing in I think it was into like I don't use it is into some big port Japan and When he was sailing in there was just white flags everywhere Everywhere and he was looking around he said it he said it literally looked like snow I'm wired like call a corny, but you know high-landered like You know how you would absorb like the strength of like that's kind of kind of like Well, you know HR and how do I can possibly you have to still find a way to do that appropriately because HR doesn't have anything to do with having discipline process procedure You know no, no, I'm talking about getting in and knowing what's going on with your people and in their life and And doing hard things together, you know because I think what people call you got to show up on time do this part of your job We've learned that over and over again In strany us combat troops are soon worn out and quickly used up The forces must receive timely reinforcements in leaders men animals battle needs and War materials of all kinds Boys are gonna get worn out after a while the mission and the situation form the basis of action The mission and the situation form the basis of action the mission designates the objective to be a chain to be attained The leader must never forget his mission a mission which indicates several tasks easily Deverts from the main exit objective so once again prioritize next year If you've got a bunch of different things you're not gonna achieve the main objective At a situation recently Where people were wearing some of their teammates out and was talking to this company about how to do this so I learned that very early What you don't you don't and it was great for me because that was another thing that initially taught me Hey, you got your standard operating procedures you got two squads You know you got two squads in a pertinent cool one is base one is assault don't pull the heavy weapons into the base force Because you might need them well, I think and two it's it's if the enemy In the in their he's saying well the enemy is is fixed right you have it it presumes The frontal assault like that's the main effort and and but if that shifts if they become wise to the flanking maneuver and then I'm gonna reassess yes and guess what if it's the wrong decision Now you know that if it's the wrong direction you just you hit a wall there now you just figured that out Where when you made no decision you still you don't you still know which way to go that's right 360 degrees so when I say hey we're gonna go 90 degrees cool we take a step Overwatch we're about to bring online which is gonna be for Everyone in the military because We the demand is so high and look you're in special operations great you got some you know you've got great leadership experience You know who else has great leadership experience In for triple tune commander right on infantry platoon sergeant That's That's Rommel so back was executed Um, but like I said his character obviously was a little bit you know what he had some some good character traits stood up for what he believed in and the fact that this book Trooping through them The fact that this book Is Has been so widely copied the Americans use something based on of the brits you something based the German still use something based on it Really kind of reveals his leadership knowledge so with that we'll go to the book The book Trooping through them am I getting better at saying that sounds good to me trooping for them All right kicks off with the introduction the introduction starts with The conduct of war is an art depending upon free creative activity Scientifically grounded is that the way you think of it. And it's funny because a lot of times people you know what's what you know they asked this question almost like a rhetorical question like But what is a leader you know, but what really is leader there you go yeah, we just just read it I'm gonna take an extra Half hour for lunch every day if that's that's no people don't even want to do that Like people might think they want to do that people might think they want to do that, but they don't want to do that No, they don't want to do that They don't want to do that they want to get after it and that's our job as leaders is to set that bar and to set it even a little bit higher so there's the origination of smieck It's you know it comes from the troop in fear That's where we got good man how this book has it has escaped Like my junior officer training you know what I mean like that's what we're trying to solve right now
