so these you know like if your academy allows whatever color geese want like victory does then you whatever color you want then you kind of go into this game with it the game which actually doesn't really exist really and that's like if you're a new guy and you show up with a pink geek or a crazy like you know those weird geese and a gold belt or something like how Jeff clevery so where that gold belt or was it friend you did that they bought it anyway bill cooper even if you do that then it's like Man, I remember when I started you to and this was like a few, like a year or two years in, I remember being kind of apprehensive, not apprehensive, kind of scared, actually in Endless working at the club where you kind of walk around and, you know, in the that club situation, it's that you can't know if it can be like, you don't know if this guy knows you're exactly men and where he, where it's like man, I got his humble. But I think what's more important given the stage and this is real generally speaking because people are different but learn the moves, you know the crisp like move like how to do an arm lock where your hips should be and shouldn't be and what makes it an arm lock a good arm lock and when makes an arm lock, for example a bad arm lock, you know where it's like you know how some guys can do an arm lock Like if I'm saying, you know, people say, I don't know, no one's saying, no one's saying, or like, if I say, like, I say, like, a lot, do you not like that? It's just, you know, like someone who's saying, just live in an insecure, you know, someone comes in, like, especially if you're in like a certain type of instructor and you're used to like everyone just listening to every word you say and then, I don't know, a student or someone comes with something different than what you said. I think you're right about that that's right you know to your point how you get when you want to do so it's kind of like a faint right in boxing maybe a little bit more like how you say I'm gonna when I go for a move as this as a set up move you got to really sell that move you got a really big going for that And it's weird how like when you, when you're successful in something, I don't know, whatever, even like in like life, like if you're, you're, you're, I don't know, you're career or something. I maybe I brushed my teeth too soon before I drank the milk you know something like this foul nobody see it you can do certain things that affects your little taste buds or whatever it was like that it was like it was a question mark it wasn't like But like any, any decision like situation where you're going to okay, I'm going to make the right call or the right, you know, tactics or what, you know, to get a certain result or whatever. I guess right sure then let's jocco store dot com and get some patches I got some warrior kid patches I got this will those should be on there right now actually for the warrior kids and the geese and the geese the backpack wherever you want to put down you don't represent where your kids also other patches on there too discipline equals freedom what not also psychological warfare if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jocco tracks that help you through every moment of weakness that you might come across can not because apparently not all of us go through moments of weakness it's rare but some people they just power through for those types of people psychological warfare not for them I think I think they just power through and continue powering through maybe even teach us how to just power through but for the rest of us hit moments of weakness we listen to psychological warfare given what the weakness is so if my weakness is hitting the snooze and not getting up early there's a track for that it's jocco on that track talking to you telling you why you should get up not yelling he's playing the game Like, no, instead of saying, so like the first case, like if you, if you went left and said, right, you ended up getting mortars, you know, you said, well, the, I didn't expect the enemy to use mortars. So it seems like, you know, ain't given what you said that his kind of objective or his kind of outlook or his way of being when he goes into the situation is, hey, man, sure, there's, there's going to be these chance that there's going to be a chance that the result isn't going to be that good. but no we're still calling it jocco white tea in books way the warrior kid tons the series right there's two books out right now and so much awesome feedback on that it's awesome thanks for posting pictures of your kids studying reading doing book reports training jiu jitsu working out it's awesome to say thank you and if you have kids or you no kids get them on that same path if you want to support a warrior kid go to irishokes ranch.com and get some soap made by the warrior kid aiden because you know you need to see soap if you are going to stay clean don't forget about the discipline you could free them field manual same thing awesome feedback you ever heard the saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away yes not really read one section of the field manual a day I know it doesn't rhyme and part of that which I did mention I think maybe last time there's anti-inflammatory stuff in there too like natural stuff not like ibuprofen something like that like anti-inflammatory that's a good example and when when you get and you know have full of those down or you're just your general game down in that particular way then you can start like leaking into that kind of way thinking where it's like But I think generally speaking like these those types of tactics like where I'm going to go for this and then when he reacts to that thing, I went for it then I'm going to really do my real move kind of thing and there can be chains too, by the way. no he was he had a real strength he's like just mix this up you know it's like a little thing just mix this up only you know you see the thing leave the screen And also what it feels like, man, I remember thinking like this skinny guy right here, especially a tall skinny guy, who in, if you didn't know about you, just a tall skinny guy, there's one other than a non-fact, they're kind of thing. And the answer is that there's a dichotomy to this, that they're like like all of life and like all of business and like all of leadership. but then it's like soy milk or canned milk or powder milk that can be added because it wouldn't be in my house in the rest of us you know the difference that's the point you know the different lactose free milk and regular milk like the difference isn't that obvious in my opinion but I was like does this taste different like you know it's like a question it's not guaranteed it could have been me or it's like an exuser or it's fine or not or even acceptable or whatever, but it does make sense though, even like competitors, you know, like, I got it. so you've provided another layer it has been turned into layers and also you know you know how you say rock like I said well this is what I thought you know when you say rock on and you have the two fingers right point index finger I thought that was like some Viking thing the way you're having it okay hard core heavy metal to heavy metal like when you go to this it's like this Or the opposite of what you said or something that kind of indicates that what you said is 100% correct is like boom, you're going to defend that little position that you've kind of grown accustomed to, you know, especially if you're even a little bit insecure, you're going to at least have those feelings. yeah you can't talk about that one I don't know the effects good point put it this way I have never lost my temper I have never broke down and cried well the beautiful while I'm on the discipline there you go so the proof is in the pudding so it is an emotional enhancing situation as well but whatever your mission is there's some neutral pick stuff in there for cognitive enhancement and a little bit of caffeine if you're into caffeine a little bit micro dose as we call it you know that's a good one too don't run out also moke moke is moke I had some other day two scoops what is one serving one one scoop
