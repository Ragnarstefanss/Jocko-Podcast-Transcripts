I mean, that's why my kid's wrestle, you know, it's because I didn't wrestle, and I hate that fact, because I go against, like he's saying, you know, I go against a good high school wrestler, I it's hard for me to take him to the ground, you know, you get somebody that wrestled in college, I know what's, I know I'm not good. so something's like anything else is like you're you're probably gonna take the ones that you feel like you need or you want help with you know like if you're like That sounds like, you know, maybe someone who's fully blaming themselves and then like, instead of taking action to, you know, implement corrective measures, something like this they're like, I suck and I don't mean diet like I'm just saying eating correctly and not incorrectly if you're about to slip on that you get enticed like my sister explained she did with her son brings home some brownies she couldn't help but eat the brownies now she's paying for it on the treadmill according to her words not like at the moment of the introduction of the brownies or donuts as the case maybe you put on one of these tracks it's called sugar coated lies snack time she's got a coated lies listen to jockel he'll explain to you some stuff that will cause you to not slip on that plan and this goes for like I said waking up doing the workout pushing yourself during the workout all this stuff getting your work to all this stuff yep we do those long range leadership alignment programs yes that is what we do so me life jpg day of work combat leadership applied to business and life check the website echelon front dot com or email info at echelon front dot com also the master and again this is not a seminar about getting pumped up no it isn't a seminar about finding yourself it's not going to help you channel your internal cheat towards eternal bliss it's not going to do that it's not what the musters about the muster is about leadership pragmatic leadership skills for you to use in your business and your life you work with people you lead people or you aspire to lead people who's going to teach you how to do that where you're going to learn that from actual question where do you learn that from who's going to teach it to you learn to lead your people learn to lead yourself may fourth and fifth New York City so yes I'm like I'm not expecting that I mean that just has to do with naps but this the new mood one that's for like if you have like stress you know but don't talk about it if we don't know then talk about another thing so you understand now if you're if you know what happens to sodium metal when you put in water that's gonna be used that's the amazon click i'm just saying i think it's important to like remember that because it's that's really you do think it's important so that's don't let's don't let's don't mind this every time subscribe to the podcast i didn't stitch our google play all the podcast platforms and right of you review if you're in the mood that's a good right of you so put the rankings if our podcast is in good ranking that's cool You know, so if I play the wrestling game, and I know I know wrestling, like I'm solid, I can wrestle against good wrestlers, maybe not Taylor, but good wrestlers. so I was like should I need more meat in there looking at the fridge like nothing so I got a little bit of your bar too worried where it's in chopped them up and like put it in there and like he just helped it in the microwave it's actually good then and I said I like being angry I don't think I'll try your your potion which is also kind of strange even that I mean I know you don't actually like being angry you're also not angry all the time that's true I don't think I've seen you angry You know, I mean any physical move is helpful to know and not a defend whether it be from offensive, or defense position, but again, if you're trying to narrow it down and teach these guys who their approach and their knowledge comes from the vastness of grappling, and you want to narrow it down to this thing, it may or may not work, you know, and it may or may not serve you, it could work against you, but here, let's try to learn this, real hard, You know, like, you know how certain people they're like, oh, this guy's accent is too thick. You know, they say like, if you get like emotions, you've got to like let it out, punch a pillow or whatever. no I bought it for my wife because she you know how like she's the kind where she like if there's a task like let's do the task real task Unless you're doing it like seven days a week for, you know, a few weeks then you can start to feel like, hey, or your nutrition is bad or I don't know something. okay we're putting it on there will be the judge of that over here on this end also jocos a store if you don't know it's called jocosstore dot com if you uh you know if you like these shirts that we make and we put effort into the shirts they're not like the cheap make a stencil spray paint cheap hands not that hands is cheap but cheap shirt here I'm probably either sleep in her close to sleep you know not everyone's like that where there'll be like all the stuff was on my mind because I go into taking an app and I'm like BTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTFBTF can't sleep car do some antioxidant that you're the first lady you know when you get the krill oil take care of your joints you'd be surprised the role they play and everything that's my opinion if you're not on that get on that also good way to support amazon click through what you do is you go be free to your amazon shopping if you don't already be for you do your amazon shopping go through the website jocopadcast.com or jocostory which are click on the amazon link also it's also called support click on support well amazon link whatever then you so you click through the website then you go do your amazon shopping outstanding way to support really good support then you do shopping as you normally would in boom instant support and you know it doesn't cost you anything cost you two seconds of your time for big support Grammar Nazis like me and you are telling you about, you know, you get through something or beat the beach and you're like, you know, I correct you. i guess so i think so or subscribe to or and subscribe to youtube if you're into youtube you watch videos you can see this podcast obviously in video format or all the excerpts that we put on there you said that like there's this massive there is so there is and there's more coming and you know those these are good because you can share them with your friend you know And so boom, now I got to do a study of the flashcard for that last 25% to lock in the knowledge where when I go in to take the test, I know 100% I know, I'm going to know every answer on the question. But you do, too, like I said, it's just so unless you're being that guy, that parent, you know the one who's like you're going no matter what. Marya grand marquee are we playing around no we are not the first master was awesome why are we having a second muster because the first muster was awesome that's why we're having a second muster so come to it and until we see you at the muster because by the way I'm going to be there life's going to be there jp's going to be there Dave Burke going to be there that's not enough for you and you need something to kind of close the deal no worry because echo Charles is going to be there probably giving you four hour speech to the public And so the fact that you can pull guard gives you this entire out to get away from doing take downs, and you can still be victorious, and that goes along with these techniques that he mentioned, like, you know, through, see hip, basically there's, there's a lot of moves in there, there are big moves, big moves, and they do help you, but like I said, they're just, they're simply not necessary. so they're not that kind they're good they got some you know cool these are if you like them so check out those go there jocosstore dot com if you want to support in that way get a shirt and represent in the wild boom women stuff whatever shirts patches rash guards 19% performance increase proven 147% proven 19% improvement who do you say as well it's getting warmer i understand but still it's cold someplace I mean, I just don't have the time and the motivation to do it, because I'm in the same boat as, you know, the guy that you're just talking about, how much time am I going to focus on take downs, I know I go against a college wrestler, he's taking me down. But they understand, they realize, you know, and for, you know, for my, for my young daughter that was, you know, five years old at the time, I said, I said, this is how we get food and this is how you get toys. but like why do you think you know I should do that this will you know you won't be so angry all the time Because it's almost like you're doing like you're going through that war or that particular ambush or something like that. but I didn't feel like I was in a new mood but from the people that other people that take it because you know like it was good though even you're used to worry about kind of like beef jerky or like it was it like soft and moist it was no I actually, it's kind of like what you're talking earlier about surfing without a leash or about, you know, parachuting under a pressure situation where I don't know what the hell Yeah, and it seems like, like to, because he was originally not complaining about complaining, but he, his premise was that, you know, jiu-jitsu is not in fact the hardest one to mask. on it's the best supplements let's get that out of the way like straight up factually brother also they have like you know where your butt proud the other day Just don't Ziggy the exit, meaning don't don't have a bad exit, which like at this point, like I said, I was probably batting 50% bad exits because I just didn't know what I was doing. If you didn't know that, you know, you're like, for rats who cares kind of thing. i just manipulate the thing to the little bookmark place where he can start but if you don't you don't want to do all that you can just find the excerpt that i put on the youtube channel you know they're just more shareable so they don't have a listen to the whole podcast to get the you know the it's a specific lesson that's really cool you'd think that there would be a lot of those from your excitement about them We didn't know that there was defenses that we hadn't been told about to the south and why that's why we should come into the north or we didn't know that the sun would be at our back from the north and that's why we didn't know that at the time. but what seems like the couch nap year in this mental state that is kind of like you have low expectations comfort you know There's no jiu-jitsu guy in the gym that goes to the first tournament and says, yeah, that was just like what I thought it was going to be like, no, they're not used to that intensity. But once he, if he can give up the wrestling rules, you know, you know, he, he, he, because he has that athleticism, he switches hips, like all quick. And you know, he's like in Jocco kind of like laughed at me. Some people in your case, apparently, you feel that in surfing with the leash, but I think some people that at the same time, it's like wearing a mouthpiece too, you know? so it's almost like you can't sleep because the conditions are perfect when you have that expectation of perfect conditions but on the couch you don't have that expectation you're just like it's like if you're napping outside of the bed I don't have a blanket I'll just pull this pillow over my left arm And if they know and they understand, then it's like it's clear, you know, but not, that's not to say that they don't have a point, though. so order it now real easy also discipline equals freedom field manual that's coming in October same thing order it so you can get a copy when it comes out the manual will show you how to get after it that's it it's the field manual you want to get after it you get the field manual there's one equals freedom you've heard that you probably think that you actually probably know that how to execute it you get the field manual following instructions workouts thoughts food intake sleep habits everything's in there no factor extreme ownership also it's just word amount keeping it in the top one the 200 on amazon that's insane thank you all for spreading the word and getting your people in the game get them a copy You know how like, you know, if someone's always taking responsibility for the whole deal, they're not blaming you at all. we both have omega threes with us they're attached to me we're a mean you're on the guest list hey who am I gonna let in jocco and his rowdy crew of omega threes they be seals they do burpees at random times they want you know or echo because they're just cruising they both spend money they both all though omega threes spend money they gotta be in the nightclub but which omega threes is the bounce you're gonna let in your omega threes they'll make a threes attached to you the triglyceride or to the phospholipids who's me so it's like you know small action bigger reaction like sodium in water Because the smart people, like Elon Musk in Sam Harris, they're all, you know, you got to watch out because this artificial intelligence is going to become smarter than us. Because it can seem like a 50 50 or it can seem like 60 40, you know. You know, like, like you're expressing yourself. And vice versa, where, you know, like, I don't know something about claustrophobia. sort of I don't like the couch naps to that they're pretty dope because I think you're gonna go I'm gonna nap boom can you feed up elevate set the alarm clock couch nap is just like what happened I hear good things because I'm thinking probably in the back of your mind you're like you know I'm cruising right now You know, I actually have answered this question before and maybe not this specific, but I'm going to go over it quickly just because this isn't just about military, you know, relationships. And I said, you know what, if a lot of people are asking the same question, there must be a need to know or people are interested in what the answer is. Just like soccer, like certain places you're going to see more people playing soccer. Yeah, I mean, there is if you're a big guy, you should carry something big like a like a machine gun. Now I have developed good take down defense over the years, and it's actually take down offense, because I have offensive ways of defending the take down, you know, I'm going to throw submissions stuff, but I can't go back in time and go through the training that you get when you're a high school wrestler and college wrestler, I can't do that, I can't do it. The next day, I was like, leg day, you know, I was going to go do squats. That's how good his base is, you know, it's, you know, yeah, wrestling. I think that like how you say you want to put yourself in the guy's head, you know. Yeah, and I'm going to go on record now as saying this, just because, you just who doesn't focus on take downs, doesn't mean that you shouldn't focus, you should learn take downs, you need to know take downs from a self defense perspective, from an MMA perspective, take downs wrestling, you have to do it. wait I think we do know I think the conversation went in that direction of its own like momentum Do you get to the life wrestling this life wrestling is like grappling grappling is like, next question, hello, do you happen to have a podcast discussing loyalty to marriage that involves marriage to a service member? you know what right a little note in the copy that you get for your team get them a little advice what chapter you think is suited for them get them on board up and down the chain of command by the way you don't want your whole team to be outperforming your leadership which is what will happen if you just get the book for them and you echelon front leadership and management consulting keynote speeches But man, if a wrestler can't break the rule to go to his back, you know, because a lot of wrestlers will give up their back all day, because they don't want to go on their back, you know? Yeah, it's like rolling with people that you're better than, you know? The answer is, and this is, you know, I figured out years later, it's like no, actually they don't need to hear from me right now. you can see why she didn't like making videos we could be in a whole new scenario right now you know I want it for her And at the same time, there are few, there are certain situations where if you misuse a comma or misuse or don't put quotes or something like that, you can literally say something different than their, you know, misunderstanding skin kind of creep in. But I think so I think you're, I think naturally they're going to take to something like you do, too. Like, the intentions of something like that first intention of something is going to be manned. but when I when you can go like in your room and you lay down and you're like way away with the temperature is just a little bit not cool I mean, like, you say don't work so hard that you don't have a, it depends how rigid or resilient like the family is. I'm not going to every single time I'm not going to go in and be like, let's just see what I learned today. You know, like you, you can't just go into, let's say I'm a guy I work out. yeah until the muster you can also find us or on the interwebs cruising and in echo's case cruising hard we're on twitter instagram and facebook echo is at echo Charles and i am at jocca willink and lastly thanks for listening and giving us feedback and inspiring us to do this inspiring us to do better and to be better knowing that we aren't alone on this mission knowing that you all are with us in the game standing watch not backing down not settling for average not just going through the motions but living living life living life hard and fast and aggressively and taking every opportunity to step up step forward step on fear and step on failure and step toward a better you and step out into the unknown to get after it so until next time this is echo and jockel out So, you know, if you've got to do submarine lockouts and you're a big guy, you're going to be in a little escape trunk, a little six foot sphere with a bunch of gear in there. And do they end up then, and I don't, you know, I'm not a, I don't even know what you call a person that theorizes about this kind of thing. And the reason some people don't use it, it came from the new, I think it came from newspaper where they're trying to, you know, fit stuff in the column and they're going to fit stuff in the newspaper. it wasn't so it was still the worry about it was just a warm warrior bar it worked it worked the flavor profile worked like it majestically I have to give that one a run anyway worry bars if you didn't know what that is there look on it dot com it's buffalo meat and it's still gluten free by the way um okay let me adjust the temperature only wait like I hear something outside let me close the door you know but you know the kind where me if I'm like I'm gonna go take a nap from three to four when I go in at two fifty nine to go take a nap in the advent of me doing that I go in at two fifty nine at three Yeah, those are ones that you don't, like, they're big, they're like granddad.
