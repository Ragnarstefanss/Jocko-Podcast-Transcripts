and this is what we are doing he's already got gigs booked which is awesome echelon front dot com if you need help with leadership in your organization we will help you that's what we do we have the master in 2019 23 24 May and Chicago 1920 September in Denver 4 and 5 December in Sydney Australia every event we've done has sold out go to extremownership.com if you want to come otherwise it's gonna be sold out and you won't be able to come and you'll be all mad and you'll be mad at me and then someone said that it's like when I went to Lala Palusa and I went and saw Rollins who I kind of knew and I was like hey man can you get us in and Rollins said it be easier to sneak you into Fort Knox and I kind of like was all hard to call or like he kind of forgot what it's like in the streets but it was an up to him exactly now now I'm the guy now I'm the guy that's going to be saying hey be easier to sneak you into Fort Knox I gave you a heads up your big time now so we're gonna check that's that EF online online interactive training from echelon front we needed to speak to more people and we don't have enough instructors can run enough monsters each year and it was a good contrast for them to see because it made it so obvious like why you have to work together why these relationships we have inside the tasking you're so important why we need if you have an issue you're bringing it up you're bringing it to me why it's not going to freak me out why we're going to talk about it why you know life always says and stoner would it tell you the same thing if life thought like hey I'd like to try this a different way I'd be like cool how do you want to try it go let's let's make it happen I don't care I don't I don't care what happens as long as it makes us win so there was a really cool for me unfortunately it was not cool for you to be in a position where I could look and use the leadership failures in that task unit and the other interesting thing was like you talk about those two guys you're yeah having no idea what's gonna happen is the worst I I talk about that example of rats and a cage and how the rats on one side of the cage they just get electrocuted randomly from the floor and but the electrocution isn't very strong the other side of the cage has a stronger electrocution shock but there's a little light that comes on that lets them know that you're about to get shocked and rats prefer to know that they're gonna get shocked even if it's more often and even if it's stronger they just prefer to know that it's common as opposed to be just randomly getting shocked and you know why it's gonna happen and that's basically where you where your task unit was because there was I mean it was like a public too it was like a public everyone kind of knew it was going on at least after about six months you know I would say after all of us being at the team for about six months it was readily apparent that's for sure and you guys actually the one of the pieces of collateral damage that was Mike's are Ellie and Mike's are Ellie he they didn't know what to do with them because I forget what the internal conflict Yeah that's a good point though when you say where does it go down to so three I would say there my son is like two he was like just before two and a half and I'd read him more reading it to my daughter he's there but he'll catch certain things you know when there's like monsters ready to bite he'll be you know like he'll know certain stuff so as you kind of get older you absorb more and more and so that's kind of what happened there the boss the new boss comes in and says hey here's what's going on here's what we're gonna do hey you guy that's all jacked up here's what you need to improve and everyone instead of what in your mind you might think hey I'm gonna piss everyone off if I come in and lay down the law at this you gotta remember that people have been wondering what the hell is going on for six months for a year they don't know who's in charge everything's a disaster no decisions are gonna be you come in and people go thank god thank you for telling me what the hell you want I'm tired of playing a guessing game every Monday morning about who's my boss and what direction we're going into so that's that's an important part remember now I am definitely there's a dichotomy of course because you can come in and you can start barking orders and everyone just says who are you where you come from you don't know what you're talking about you haven't been here shut up and of course they won't say that to you they'll just undermine what you're trying to do and calls all kinds of you know just just trying you serve you with whatever they can so that's probably but what I'm saying is there is a a happy medium and there are times when you lean towards being laying down the wall there's times where you lean towards being more loose and you gotta figure out where that's gonna be depending on the situation you're diving into and and so if if anything you do is like fashion which I mean there's some fashion stuff in your past like maybe hair styles etc that's why if you see old pictures of jacco with his hair you feel like you know that's kind of the thing that's the that's the guy that Jason was talking about earlier that's me like we like that And I'm just, you know, everything's a joke or whatever and get out of the vehicle and, you know, some guys yelling at us with the fake Russian accent and I'm just laughing at it inside and which means, you know, I'm like kind of, I got that I was 19 and the dude, the dude comes over and he like yells at me and I, you know, who knows what I said to prove that I was a tough guy and this dude correct me and I was like, but a huge cost so there's like this too little additional elements to a successful spas escape or whatever one you gotta be at least somewhat strong like you can like a smaller person like spasking is less effective even at high level there's that and then when you're strong when you're strong person and you spas successfully you're way more tired way more tired so you get a person where you put them in a spashing state like two three three times in a row and they make that emotional decision when in fact the teams can take care of you too you know the teams can go hey look we know you need some downtime you're gonna go to buds and be an instructor or whatever you know for three years you know you can get your kid through high school or whatever so the teams has a good job usually of taking care of of the people you know taking care of team guys but sometimes you know people they have the grassest screener situation and again in the 90s we're planning we're training for a big game that we're not going to do So a guy get pushed off a roof, we were watching, and in the evening we had gotten someone said, hey, this one building about two kilometers away, that's one of the clan leaders buildings, and we could see guys up there in the evening, and they get that caught there, that makes them all go kind of crazy, and we'd see guys sitting there like watching the sunset up on a roof, and then one of them when start to get animated, the waving their arms around, like there are going about something, then they were all animated, then they were up like beating each other with clubs, hitting each other with rocks, and then it would just stop, and then it would start up again, and I think at least one of those, we watched the guy just get pushed off a roof, fall dead, when that is just how they were all. so I feature like like famous Gigi to people or when you know like Jeff Glover, Keen and Kreni like these guys premise is we're just living our life but and you know what I'm the great part that you just mentioned is like a three hour conversation yeah which we don't aren't gonna have right now because look the second part of your career or the part that if yeah we'll get into this we'll do another one we'll just we'll just roll do another podcast we'll record it like tomorrow and that's gonna follow you into Afghanistan back to Iraq again more time more training more tours combat tours tours as senior listed tours as the command master chief tours as an ops master chief I mean there's a lot of massive stuff to talk about from here on out so we'll do that we'll record and you know I know in a way too where that's why these little smaller guys when they're super advanced I don't think they have for spas ever because it's always like it's been unproductive for them right every attempted spas is gonna be like unsuccessful you know Because, because now I look back, how awesome it must be when you got like guys like that at the team who were just like, oh, yeah, So was your dad was your dad kind of like the stereotypical marine that was just like, oh, like acting like a drill started charging. Then this camp that was 500 yards south of us, we saw a group of like seven guys, two of them had RPGs, you rocket propellant grenades, another guys patrolling with like two peak two pkm gunners, they're built finishing guns and like an AK gunner and they're patrolling and we can see him, we can see him and now they come out the front of the camp and at the gate of that camp which is facing us 500 yards away, there's two sandbagged positions for the watches who would be up there to check people coming in and out. And then a guy that straight across for me, I can remember seeing a big black hand come over his shoulder and it like covers up half of his chest, like like Andre the giant big and just moved the dude away and then another guy, a hand moves the other guy away and I think about just having a guy like Monty who's like level headed who's been in some shit before and can go you know what hey we need to shoot this guy before he shoots it us that's just totally sensible thing to say but if if everyone's because you got these massive oh RLE briefs and everyone's being paranoid They're only allowed to like hit you from out here to here, but it was like, you know, those those images in Rocky where it was like, oh, stars and that just, oh, that was that little smirk I just had on my face laying on the ground over there. and when I went to college for three years and when I came back I was like right the main thing I learned in college was never ever ever ever get out of the teams ever because it dealing with other people it was just so horrible and especially I mean like you and me who literally spent our whole adult life in a puttune you get out of in a normal people and you're like what are you everyone doing once I have what why is this even happening it just nothing makes sense like hey they're both guys I actually know both those guys and would be getting debrief to buy both of them like both of them would be telling me what the other person was doing and man you just be thinking guys instead of telling me go tell each other go talk to each other it didn't happen I was super stoked and super jealous of course like every other guy was like which actually this is why I did another arc because it seemed like hey if you're going to get some action you need to go with the Marine Corps in the arc and go out and do that. but man when you when you don't have that everyone's all excited everyone's freaking out and everything's just magnified and so it's pretty impressive and to me you know again you have a guy like Monty that's just looking at the OIC it's boss and saying hey we actually need to kill this guy right now and and not being like we need to take this guy out which just escalated then the OIC is thinking yeah we're like what's it pops with them when it got to go out and some ops with them got to go on a lot of date like my favorite thing to do was go out on daytime presence patrols with the army or the Marine Corps because that's was so fun you know but um you know that's uh the land it was under land warfare and the land warfare all I see at the time was uh worn off so pressure dug pressure to do some awesome dude he still works in shooting to this day and uh we got a lot of cool stuff done like we got the the ballistic computers which made you know shooting a whole lot more predictable just hey you're good load another round just being calm when I think about the advantage and how that's a pretty good performance you know what you guys who's a pretty good performance with no experience because I think of how you know what what I gain through experience and the maturity the combat maturity of seeing things and things unfolding being like yeah there's an organization that does a lot of just like work for like honestly cancer kids and stuff like that it's a situation that unfolds that you know is going to unfold that you know is not the correct thing to do and there's no way you can stop yourself from doing it like you just said you someone's gonna arm lock you you know what's gonna happen you could just go yeah deans thumbs up he's like training he's like the ex boyfriend of his data whatever so so Vader like chops his head off uh-huh hey man you got your lawn you're one like one degree separation from getting all the new stuff to where you're at really because it feels like 180 you know I'm over here looking on mine it's stuff anyway also mok right mornin jacen we talked earlier you just want that's not going on a style no sure it's not so there we go origin jeans we are in production with origin jeans in production at this time so check the website originmain.com if you want to get some jeans or if your name is not jacca will link you can get pair of joggers the joggers are good that's the thing where I got I wasn't down for the joggers Pete told me this he opened my open my little like a mind or whatever I put him on I was like dang these are comfortable but man they're skinny they're thin
