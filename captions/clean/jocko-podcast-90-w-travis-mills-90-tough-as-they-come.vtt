00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jocco podcast number 90.

2
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.80
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:09.80
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:22.16
As my wife Tori mentioned, this past week has been one of the most challenging of my life.

6
00:00:22.16 --> 00:00:26.48
I want to say thanks to my friends and family for your support.

7
00:00:26.48 --> 00:00:32.08
You really have no idea how a much a few words of encouragement can mean when you are

8
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:35.36
at a time in place like this.

9
00:00:35.36 --> 00:00:38.64
Thanks again.

10
00:00:38.64 --> 00:00:44.000
My platoon is in a very active area of operations in southern Afghanistan.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.88
Our mission is to close with and destroy the enemy.

12
00:00:47.88 --> 00:00:54.60
There is no outside the wire here because there is no wire.

13
00:00:54.60 --> 00:00:59.000
My boys are simply always on alert.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.84
We haven't had a shower since we've been in Afghanistan.

15
00:01:02.84 --> 00:01:08.76
We've run nonstop missions and have been very successful at accomplishing these without

16
00:01:08.76 --> 00:01:14.12
experiencing any injuries to our own.

17
00:01:14.12 --> 00:01:19.12
I'm just trying to paint a picture of life here and not trying to make you feel sorry for

18
00:01:19.12 --> 00:01:21.96
us.

19
00:01:21.96 --> 00:01:30.000
Trust me, I belong here with these guys and we are a family.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.52
Rather, I want to paint a picture because I'd like to tell you about Travis Mills.

21
00:01:36.52 --> 00:01:44.20
I know you don't know him, but it would mean a lot to me to be able to spread his story.

22
00:01:44.20 --> 00:01:49.96
My platoon's string of missions without injury came to an abrupt and violent end last week

23
00:01:49.96 --> 00:01:55.96
when we had dismounted ID during combat operations.

24
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:00.12
I had three paratroopers injured from the blast.

25
00:02:00.12 --> 00:02:10.56
One was minor, one was severe, and one was simply beyond words.

26
00:02:10.56 --> 00:02:19.16
The most severe injury was sustained by my weapon squad leader, Travis Big Mills.

27
00:02:19.16 --> 00:02:23.32
I'd like to take the opportunity to tell you about him.

28
00:02:23.32 --> 00:02:28.68
Even under the conditions that I've described, he is the best of us.

29
00:02:28.68 --> 00:02:33.96
He was the biggest guy in the platoon and has the biggest heart to go with it.

30
00:02:33.96 --> 00:02:38.16
He was eager to please and always cheer this up.

31
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:42.88
He led from the front and was injured because of it.

32
00:02:42.88 --> 00:02:49.76
He preferred that he take the injury over any man in his squad.

33
00:02:49.76 --> 00:02:56.48
He was the most fearless person I have ever seen in combat.

34
00:02:56.48 --> 00:03:00.92
When we weren't in combat, he was great to have around.

35
00:03:00.92 --> 00:03:05.48
He woke up every morning and sang a bunch of different songs to us.

36
00:03:05.48 --> 00:03:12.36
Usually Kasia or Britney Spears were the songs of some other girl band.

37
00:03:12.36 --> 00:03:13.88
We had this ritual.

38
00:03:13.88 --> 00:03:17.76
Anytime we finished a patrol where we had a fire fight, once we returned to the strong

39
00:03:17.76 --> 00:03:24.44
point, he'd run to the front of the formation and sing songs about the 82nd Airborne.

40
00:03:24.44 --> 00:03:27.96
He would do dance gestures and all.

41
00:03:27.96 --> 00:03:32.36
He even did it for the brigade commander when he came to visit.

42
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:35.80
It was a big hit.

43
00:03:35.80 --> 00:03:42.04
I laughed at how or he laughed at how serious I am and how I don't like to be touched.

44
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:47.76
So, he made it his personal mission to make me laugh.

45
00:03:47.76 --> 00:03:53.32
Usually this involved an overly aggressive and a little too intimate manhug followed

46
00:03:53.32 --> 00:03:59.28
by a middle school style dance where he'd grind on me.

47
00:03:59.28 --> 00:04:02.12
He kept me sane.

48
00:04:02.12 --> 00:04:05.48
I laughed at his antics constantly.

49
00:04:05.48 --> 00:04:11.36
In combat, there is no one we would rather have been with.

50
00:04:11.36 --> 00:04:15.48
He risked his life to save others constantly and I can recall two times specifically

51
00:04:15.48 --> 00:04:20.36
where he literally saved me.

52
00:04:20.36 --> 00:04:25.20
Needless to say, I took his injury hard, including the personal guilt that'll be

53
00:04:25.20 --> 00:04:29.36
your feels when he is responsible for his men.

54
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:34.64
So I wanted to tell you these things.

55
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:37.60
Everyone is asking how I'm doing.

56
00:04:37.60 --> 00:04:41.04
Yes, I am hurting.

57
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:44.48
But you know I'm going to be okay.

58
00:04:44.48 --> 00:04:49.56
More importantly, Travis is going to be okay.

59
00:04:49.56 --> 00:04:53.80
The truth is, obviously things here are so terrible that I'll never be able to put them

60
00:04:53.80 --> 00:04:54.80
into words.

61
00:04:54.80 --> 00:05:00.32
Travis is injury being at the top of the list.

62
00:05:00.32 --> 00:05:04.84
But I've also seen things here so wonderful that I'll never be able to put them into words

63
00:05:04.84 --> 00:05:07.04
either.

64
00:05:07.04 --> 00:05:11.76
I know that sounds crazy, but it's true.

65
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:15.56
How do you put into words this spirit like the one I've just described in big

66
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:19.44
mills?

67
00:05:19.44 --> 00:05:25.60
The reality of it is that I have the honor of leading people like Travis.

68
00:05:25.60 --> 00:05:31.12
There are many more in my platoon just like him.

69
00:05:31.12 --> 00:05:35.96
So while I've seen some things I'd like to never talk about again.

70
00:05:35.96 --> 00:05:40.16
I've seen just as many that I'll spend the rest of my life trying to explain to anyone who

71
00:05:40.16 --> 00:05:43.96
will listen.

72
00:05:43.96 --> 00:05:52.12
I've seen a tremendous love and care between brothers that have only each other to rely on

73
00:05:52.12 --> 00:06:00.36
and have only one care to bring each other home.

74
00:06:00.36 --> 00:06:05.92
It's a selfless, deep, everlasting bond that I consider myself lucky and absolutely

75
00:06:05.92 --> 00:06:11.20
privileged to be a part of.

76
00:06:11.20 --> 00:06:17.88
Thank you so much again for your support, but know that I am fine.

77
00:06:17.88 --> 00:06:22.36
I am exactly where I need to be right now.

78
00:06:22.36 --> 00:06:36.04
My family here is taking care of each other and we will persevere as one.

79
00:06:36.04 --> 00:06:48.48
Now that is a letter that was written to friends and family at home from Lieutenant Zach

80
00:06:48.48 --> 00:06:59.30
Lewis, commander of 1st platoon, Bravo Troop, 4703 Cavalry Squadron, 4th Brigade Combat

81
00:06:59.30 --> 00:07:09.76
to the team of the 82nd Airborne Division, the All-Americans.

82
00:07:09.76 --> 00:07:19.64
I think that letter describes staff sergeant Travis Mills as only a fellow platoon member

83
00:07:19.64 --> 00:07:23.36
could.

84
00:07:23.36 --> 00:07:39.32
Explaining his unbelievably positive attitude is courage under fire and is unwavering leadership.

85
00:07:39.32 --> 00:07:49.56
And tonight I am honored beyond words to have the man that Lieutenant Lewis spoke of.

86
00:07:49.56 --> 00:08:02.60
Travis Mills here with us to talk through his experiences on the battlefield and off.

87
00:08:02.60 --> 00:08:05.68
Travis, welcome to the show.

88
00:08:05.68 --> 00:08:06.68
Good evening.

89
00:08:06.68 --> 00:08:08.36
Thank you for having me.

90
00:08:08.36 --> 00:08:10.36
That now I am going to say this upfront.

91
00:08:10.36 --> 00:08:20.52
I was a little nervous about having you on because this show has a reputation of being

92
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:28.72
very serious and very solemn and I know that you have an issue with both of those terms

93
00:08:28.72 --> 00:08:31.72
in a broad perspective.

94
00:08:31.72 --> 00:08:38.08
So for those of you that haven't heard anything from Travis before, there's not a lot

95
00:08:38.08 --> 00:08:44.08
of serious stuff that Travis does.

96
00:08:44.08 --> 00:08:53.56
So serious comedian and hilarious guy with an incredible attitude.

97
00:08:53.56 --> 00:08:54.56
Welcome to the show man.

98
00:08:54.56 --> 00:08:55.56
Thanks for coming on.

99
00:08:55.56 --> 00:08:56.56
Thank you so much.

100
00:08:56.56 --> 00:08:59.16
I'll do my best to be serious.

101
00:08:59.16 --> 00:09:03.92
I think my altitude described it very well and that letter he wrote to his family.

102
00:09:03.92 --> 00:09:08.08
I made sure that I would cap the spirits up and I would hug him and everything like that,

103
00:09:08.08 --> 00:09:10.20
but under fire was a whole different person.

104
00:09:10.20 --> 00:09:11.20
Yeah.

105
00:09:11.20 --> 00:09:15.20
No, I thought he did a great job of capturing what everyone's feeling over there.

106
00:09:15.20 --> 00:09:21.08
And I didn't go in Afghanistan, but what is this similar to what we'd feel when I rack?

107
00:09:21.08 --> 00:09:27.08
And you know, I talk about this a lot about the fact that this is why guys miss combat.

108
00:09:27.08 --> 00:09:31.96
But you know, you miss combat, even though it's when you're over there and you're in this

109
00:09:31.96 --> 00:09:35.60
crappy situation and you're like, oh, I can't wait to get home, but then when you get home,

110
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:39.56
you have that little thing in the back of your mind that says, that misses that com

111
00:09:39.56 --> 00:09:42.08
rotter, which only comes from that place.

112
00:09:42.08 --> 00:09:45.16
So he did a good job of describing that.

113
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:52.68
So I think to understand where a man ends up, we kind of got to understand where a man

114
00:09:52.68 --> 00:10:05.08
comes from, so going back to the beginning, the young Travis Mills, the young Travis Mills.

115
00:10:05.08 --> 00:10:10.60
And you know how you grew up and all that.

116
00:10:10.60 --> 00:10:11.60
Talk a little bit about that.

117
00:10:11.60 --> 00:10:13.60
Yeah, I'm from Michigan.

118
00:10:13.60 --> 00:10:17.40
When I go around and I speak throughout the nation, I always say, is anybody from Ohio

119
00:10:17.40 --> 00:10:20.56
before I tell my permission, and I yell, oh, oh, wait, and then they yell, oh, I go and

120
00:10:20.56 --> 00:10:24.12
get real passionate and then I yell sucks.

121
00:10:24.12 --> 00:10:28.68
You know, and I get some booze, but I'm from a small town in Michigan right around the

122
00:10:28.68 --> 00:10:29.68
thumb area.

123
00:10:29.68 --> 00:10:32.40
I grew up playing football, basketball, baseball.

124
00:10:32.40 --> 00:10:34.68
I have an older sister younger brother.

125
00:10:34.68 --> 00:10:38.68
My parents are phenomenal people and, you know, just good wholesome values.

126
00:10:38.68 --> 00:10:43.76
And then I went to college to play football after high school was over and decided that

127
00:10:43.76 --> 00:10:46.68
probably wasn't a right time for me to go to college and take a serious.

128
00:10:46.68 --> 00:10:47.68
So I went to the...

129
00:10:47.68 --> 00:10:48.68
So, hold on.

130
00:10:48.68 --> 00:10:51.52
I'm playing three sports in high school.

131
00:10:51.52 --> 00:10:55.24
And I got a quote from your book in here, by the way.

132
00:10:55.24 --> 00:10:58.000
I'm going to read it.

133
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.12
I was the fun kid who lived at the end of your block.

134
00:11:01.12 --> 00:11:06.28
I was big for my age and for a lot of boyhood years, I had a big gap between my two

135
00:11:06.28 --> 00:11:07.28
front teeth.

136
00:11:07.28 --> 00:11:08.28
Yep.

137
00:11:08.28 --> 00:11:11.000
Now is that a negative thing?

138
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.24
Um, no, not at all.

139
00:11:13.24 --> 00:11:17.48
Okay, because some of us at the table here still have a gap between our four teachers.

140
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:18.48
I'm just saying.

141
00:11:18.48 --> 00:11:20.48
Oh, I'm on the sides now, right?

142
00:11:20.48 --> 00:11:21.48
Yeah, I do.

143
00:11:21.48 --> 00:11:27.48
But I like to wear my hair shaved and a buzz cup, particularly in the summers when it

144
00:11:27.48 --> 00:11:30.24
got hot with that OP Taylor kind of look.

145
00:11:30.24 --> 00:11:33.72
I fit into small town America.

146
00:11:33.72 --> 00:11:36.60
And you did karate, by the way.

147
00:11:36.60 --> 00:11:39.16
You're looking at the 1993 cry state champion.

148
00:11:39.16 --> 00:11:41.52
I should get a match.

149
00:11:41.52 --> 00:11:44.04
I was six, but...

150
00:11:44.04 --> 00:11:45.04
That's it.

151
00:11:45.04 --> 00:11:47.04
It's not a competitive age bracket for karate championships.

152
00:11:47.04 --> 00:11:49.04
I just spent a back kick.

153
00:11:49.04 --> 00:11:50.04
I just read over the rest of the match.

154
00:11:50.04 --> 00:11:52.04
Breaking ribs.

155
00:11:52.04 --> 00:11:55.04
Actually, you had a contest here.

156
00:11:55.04 --> 00:11:56.64
I'm going to read about it.

157
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64
It wasn't all easy.

158
00:11:57.64 --> 00:12:01.24
And one of my first karate matches I got kicked hard in the sternum and couldn't breathe.

159
00:12:01.24 --> 00:12:03.64
I gasped pan and tried to suck air.

160
00:12:03.64 --> 00:12:07.08
When my normal breathing didn't return immediately, I raised my hand and four fitted the

161
00:12:07.08 --> 00:12:08.08
match.

162
00:12:08.08 --> 00:12:10.84
I'm kind of disappointed.

163
00:12:10.84 --> 00:12:12.32
My dad rushed over.

164
00:12:12.32 --> 00:12:13.52
Travis, what are you doing?

165
00:12:13.52 --> 00:12:14.84
You four for the match.

166
00:12:14.84 --> 00:12:15.84
You never four for the match.

167
00:12:15.84 --> 00:12:19.16
No matter how hard you're hurting, you never quit ever.

168
00:12:19.16 --> 00:12:23.36
Yeah, my dad was as disappointed in me too.

169
00:12:23.36 --> 00:12:24.36
So I never did again.

170
00:12:24.36 --> 00:12:25.36
And then I just, I don't know.

171
00:12:25.36 --> 00:12:27.36
I just went hard to rest of that after that.

172
00:12:27.36 --> 00:12:29.88
I just, I don't know my dad taught me good values.

173
00:12:29.88 --> 00:12:31.92
My mom took karate with me.

174
00:12:31.92 --> 00:12:34.52
So don't mess with your mom either.

175
00:12:34.52 --> 00:12:35.52
No, no.

176
00:12:35.52 --> 00:12:37.52
Well, yeah, don't.

177
00:12:37.52 --> 00:12:38.96
She's just five foot two.

178
00:12:38.96 --> 00:12:40.52
The 125 pounds.

179
00:12:40.52 --> 00:12:42.52
How did she produce your big ass?

180
00:12:42.52 --> 00:12:43.52
I don't know.

181
00:12:43.52 --> 00:12:45.12
How tall was your dad?

182
00:12:45.12 --> 00:12:46.12
Five, 11.

183
00:12:46.12 --> 00:12:47.12
No kiddo.

184
00:12:47.12 --> 00:12:48.12
Yeah.

185
00:12:48.12 --> 00:12:49.12
Yeah.

186
00:12:49.12 --> 00:12:52.16
But I was six foot three when I was at my walk around weight.

187
00:12:52.16 --> 00:12:55.48
And the first match I ever had, I had a girl and she beat me.

188
00:12:55.48 --> 00:12:56.48
Because I went and hit her.

189
00:12:56.48 --> 00:12:57.48
Yeah.

190
00:12:57.48 --> 00:12:59.000
And then I was cleared to like, hit girls and I thought that.

191
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.92
Okay, so next time I thought I went to town on, you know, just put a weapon.

192
00:13:03.92 --> 00:13:06.04
And now I know you don't hit girls either way.

193
00:13:06.04 --> 00:13:07.04
Yeah.

194
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:08.04
So I learned, you know.

195
00:13:08.04 --> 00:13:09.04
That's a loose, loose situation.

196
00:13:09.04 --> 00:13:11.36
But then your mom told you no go hit her.

197
00:13:11.36 --> 00:13:12.36
Yeah.

198
00:13:12.36 --> 00:13:13.36
That's what it says in the book.

199
00:13:13.36 --> 00:13:15.36
It was like, hey, listen, you gotta go beat her up.

200
00:13:15.36 --> 00:13:16.36
Well, okay.

201
00:13:16.36 --> 00:13:18.36
So it was competition.

202
00:13:18.36 --> 00:13:21.12
And she was in my, you know, they didn't have this separate gender brackets.

203
00:13:21.12 --> 00:13:22.12
So everybody was the same.

204
00:13:22.12 --> 00:13:25.52
And the first girl I faced, I went and hit and I lost about.

205
00:13:25.52 --> 00:13:28.72
And then the next girl after that, my mom was like, you can, you can hit them.

206
00:13:28.72 --> 00:13:30.40
I was like, oh, okay.

207
00:13:30.40 --> 00:13:32.20
So I just like, you're going down.

208
00:13:32.20 --> 00:13:33.20
I'm gonna have to.

209
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:35.20
And I went after it.

210
00:13:35.20 --> 00:13:37.24
Oh, that's jacked up man.

211
00:13:37.24 --> 00:13:39.24
I mean, I was six.

212
00:13:39.24 --> 00:13:40.64
I mean, I had, yeah, yeah.

213
00:13:40.64 --> 00:13:41.64
Yeah.

214
00:13:41.64 --> 00:13:42.64
You know.

215
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:43.96
That was seven for me.

216
00:13:43.96 --> 00:13:50.20
The football team Vince Leville.

217
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:51.20
Did I say that right?

218
00:13:51.20 --> 00:13:52.20
I love you, eh.

219
00:13:52.20 --> 00:13:53.20
Okay.

220
00:13:53.20 --> 00:13:54.20
Well, you know, I'm not way about it.

221
00:13:54.20 --> 00:13:56.20
So much of a French speaker over on my hand.

222
00:13:56.20 --> 00:13:57.40
Oh, whatever that language is.

223
00:13:57.40 --> 00:13:58.40
It's not known as name.

224
00:13:58.40 --> 00:13:59.76
I would have said the same thing.

225
00:13:59.76 --> 00:14:01.28
Here's how he described you.

226
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:04.16
The first time I met Travis using middle school at Track Meat.

227
00:14:04.16 --> 00:14:05.16
I'd heard about him.

228
00:14:05.16 --> 00:14:06.16
So I went over to watch him.

229
00:14:06.16 --> 00:14:08.56
He won the shop put, which meant he was strong.

230
00:14:08.56 --> 00:14:12.04
Then he ran over, then he ran over to the 100 yard hurdles and won.

231
00:14:12.04 --> 00:14:13.72
Those, which meant he was fast.

232
00:14:13.72 --> 00:14:15.16
You don't see that combination a lot.

233
00:14:15.16 --> 00:14:17.96
I knew that this kid was going to be a special athlete.

234
00:14:17.96 --> 00:14:19.76
In high school, he became a superstar.

235
00:14:19.76 --> 00:14:22.96
Three sport athlete, baseball, basketball, and football.

236
00:14:22.96 --> 00:14:27.84
He was the leader on each team and made first team all conference in all three sports.

237
00:14:27.84 --> 00:14:30.56
With football, he was definitely a big cog in our team's wheel.

238
00:14:30.56 --> 00:14:34.52
We were the smallest going our conference and we got beat up for a lot of years.

239
00:14:34.52 --> 00:14:38.36
But his junior year Travis and his friends got into weightlifting and powerlifting and

240
00:14:38.36 --> 00:14:40.84
went to all the football camps.

241
00:14:40.84 --> 00:14:45.48
The year we won the conference championship and made the playoffs for the first time ever.

242
00:14:45.48 --> 00:14:48.96
Travis's work ethic motivated everybody.

243
00:14:48.96 --> 00:14:52.04
Everybody got stronger because Travis was their leader.

244
00:14:52.04 --> 00:14:53.04
Jack and Steel.

245
00:14:53.04 --> 00:14:55.64
What's your champions, dude?

246
00:14:55.64 --> 00:14:57.68
First time we were in the playoffs.

247
00:14:57.68 --> 00:15:00.92
How did you, what made you start lifting?

248
00:15:00.92 --> 00:15:06.92
Coach, that V.A. and when I was in seventh grade, he said that after school, if I wasn't

249
00:15:06.92 --> 00:15:09.28
playing a sport, I had to go to the flates.

250
00:15:09.28 --> 00:15:13.000
He was a vice principal, the high school, so having friends in high places is nice.

251
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.68
When you're getting trouble, you don't really get in trouble.

252
00:15:16.68 --> 00:15:21.76
The story in there about me getting trouble in class, freshman year.

253
00:15:21.76 --> 00:15:22.76
Where'd you do?

254
00:15:22.76 --> 00:15:27.44
I don't really, I broke a childish, never mind.

255
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:28.64
But just tell us what you did.

256
00:15:28.64 --> 00:15:30.56
It's in the book, you know, I was performing now.

257
00:15:30.56 --> 00:15:33.68
My buddy fired in class, I kicked in the hallway, so then my other buddy did, so I wanted

258
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:37.04
to go out there, so I found a lot of that one rip, so I can go out in the hallway.

259
00:15:37.04 --> 00:15:39.72
Take a send to the office, but you just like, guys, knock it off.

260
00:15:39.72 --> 00:15:40.72
You can't do this anymore.

261
00:15:40.72 --> 00:15:41.72
Too much protein powder?

262
00:15:41.72 --> 00:15:47.12
Oh, that's all, yeah, so my buddy, Eric, he got his parents, I'm very competitive, like

263
00:15:47.12 --> 00:15:48.12
mine were.

264
00:15:48.12 --> 00:15:52.32
And we were both the team captain and stars of the show, if he will, so I went home and

265
00:15:52.32 --> 00:15:54.68
said, hey, can I get some cell attack in nitro attack?

266
00:15:54.68 --> 00:15:57.12
And it was before like the had the rally regulations on it.

267
00:15:57.12 --> 00:15:58.68
And my parents like, no, he can't do that.

268
00:15:58.68 --> 00:16:01.32
I'm like, well, Eric's parents let him get it.

269
00:16:01.32 --> 00:16:02.32
Maybe wasn't true.

270
00:16:02.32 --> 00:16:06.16
Eric went home to the same thing to his parents, so we both got to get on those.

271
00:16:06.16 --> 00:16:07.52
And I mean, you know, protein powder.

272
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:08.52
Yeah.

273
00:16:08.52 --> 00:16:10.08
That's going to disrupt science class.

274
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:11.08
Yeah.

275
00:16:11.08 --> 00:16:12.08
We beat it.

276
00:16:12.08 --> 00:16:14.72
But no, I mean, it was fun.

277
00:16:14.72 --> 00:16:19.28
Everybody, I worked at a grocery store after the football games, the old man would come in,

278
00:16:19.28 --> 00:16:21.08
drink coffee and hang out with me.

279
00:16:21.08 --> 00:16:23.48
And my boss just like the owner of the storage accepted it.

280
00:16:23.48 --> 00:16:25.76
Like the wives would shop and I was like, you get away with it.

281
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:28.12
Yeah, I was at the water cooler, but it was a coffee pot.

282
00:16:28.12 --> 00:16:29.12
And we just hang out.

283
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:31.12
And the time when I did wrong, why did right?

284
00:16:31.12 --> 00:16:34.36
Very varsity, varsity blues, tile.

285
00:16:34.36 --> 00:16:35.36
Right, right.

286
00:16:35.36 --> 00:16:38.56
Yeah, I saw some video footage of you at those games.

287
00:16:38.56 --> 00:16:40.76
There was like madness at those games.

288
00:16:40.76 --> 00:16:43.80
Well, the one run I had was it looked pretty good on the film.

289
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:44.92
Yeah, it looked pretty good to me.

290
00:16:44.92 --> 00:16:47.68
It's one time I did anything special.

291
00:16:47.68 --> 00:16:51.24
So you get done with your senior year of football.

292
00:16:51.24 --> 00:16:55.08
And did you maintain the high level of discipline in your grades after that point?

293
00:16:55.08 --> 00:16:56.08
No.

294
00:16:56.08 --> 00:16:57.08
No.

295
00:16:57.08 --> 00:17:00.96
Actually, I broke up with the girlfriend at the four point, oh.

296
00:17:00.96 --> 00:17:01.96
Oh.

297
00:17:01.96 --> 00:17:02.96
So my grades went right down.

298
00:17:02.96 --> 00:17:03.96
Yeah.

299
00:17:03.96 --> 00:17:04.96
No more study partner.

300
00:17:04.96 --> 00:17:06.76
No more like she would help you homework.

301
00:17:06.76 --> 00:17:09.44
Yeah, being the same class and right left handed for the scratch work.

302
00:17:09.44 --> 00:17:10.44
Hand to me.

303
00:17:10.44 --> 00:17:13.60
Sorry, right nothing like that.

304
00:17:13.60 --> 00:17:16.36
And so that that man, did you get looked at?

305
00:17:16.36 --> 00:17:18.08
Did you get looked at for college ball?

306
00:17:18.08 --> 00:17:19.08
I did.

307
00:17:19.08 --> 00:17:22.56
I had a couple of offers for baseball and football.

308
00:17:22.56 --> 00:17:25.48
D2, couple D1, smaller D1.

309
00:17:25.48 --> 00:17:29.60
And for some reason, my guidance counselor, he just, I think he just knew Mr. Simpson.

310
00:17:29.60 --> 00:17:30.60
Great guy.

311
00:17:30.60 --> 00:17:33.16
He kind of figured I wasn't going to like college and be disciplined enough.

312
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:34.56
So he's like, what about this community college?

313
00:17:34.56 --> 00:17:36.80
It's a really good.

314
00:17:36.80 --> 00:17:38.44
You can go there and play football.

315
00:17:38.44 --> 00:17:42.80
And I decided to go there and I just, I mean, I was cut off for football.

316
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:46.24
I wasn't cut off for the study in there at that time in my life.

317
00:17:46.24 --> 00:17:47.24
Right.

318
00:17:47.24 --> 00:17:48.92
And so you went there for one year?

319
00:17:48.92 --> 00:17:49.92
Some Esther.

320
00:17:49.92 --> 00:17:50.92
One semester.

321
00:17:50.92 --> 00:17:51.68
And then my girlfriend was like, you should move home.

322
00:17:51.68 --> 00:17:52.68
So I did.

323
00:17:52.68 --> 00:17:53.68
Yeah.

324
00:17:53.68 --> 00:17:54.68
And then I met her boyfriend Colin.

325
00:17:54.68 --> 00:17:57.68
So then I joined the army.

326
00:17:57.68 --> 00:17:58.92
You look back in my life.

327
00:17:58.92 --> 00:17:59.92
How does happen?

328
00:17:59.92 --> 00:18:00.92
Yeah.

329
00:18:00.92 --> 00:18:01.92
It's her fault.

330
00:18:01.92 --> 00:18:02.92
Colin.

331
00:18:02.92 --> 00:18:03.92
What's your calling lately?

332
00:18:03.92 --> 00:18:04.92
I haven't talked.

333
00:18:04.92 --> 00:18:05.92
I haven't.

334
00:18:05.92 --> 00:18:06.92
Yeah.

335
00:18:06.92 --> 00:18:07.92
We all look him up.

336
00:18:07.92 --> 00:18:11.48
I mean, he worked at a, you know, the pop up golf course when I found everything out.

337
00:18:11.48 --> 00:18:15.40
So I grew up in my body up and went over there in the manager's place like Phantom home.

338
00:18:15.40 --> 00:18:17.16
Why did you tell you to come home?

339
00:18:17.16 --> 00:18:18.76
This is because I could be by her, I guess.

340
00:18:18.76 --> 00:18:19.76
I don't know.

341
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:21.20
And then I was like, hey, what's this about?

342
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:22.84
And then she found a broke down to home.

343
00:18:22.84 --> 00:18:25.76
And I was like, oh, hey, did you know the army was taking people and giving bonuses?

344
00:18:25.76 --> 00:18:26.76
Yeah.

345
00:18:26.76 --> 00:18:27.76
Because you were dead.

346
00:18:27.76 --> 00:18:28.76
You were, you ran up.

347
00:18:28.76 --> 00:18:31.44
I was, you know, it was about 10 grand in debt for me in the college.

348
00:18:31.44 --> 00:18:32.44
But that was for the whole year.

349
00:18:32.44 --> 00:18:34.72
So the baseball coach asked me to play there too.

350
00:18:34.72 --> 00:18:35.72
Day.

351
00:18:35.72 --> 00:18:36.72
Um, yeah.

352
00:18:36.72 --> 00:18:39.72
But then you, uh, you're in debt.

353
00:18:39.72 --> 00:18:44.000
You're, um, Colin was on the scene now that kind of threw a loop.

354
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.40
So you see, you're in up during the army.

355
00:18:45.40 --> 00:18:46.40
I joined the army.

356
00:18:46.40 --> 00:18:49.16
I went to all their crewters and the army had the best thing going.

357
00:18:49.16 --> 00:18:50.16
Which was cash.

358
00:18:50.16 --> 00:18:51.16
$24,000.

359
00:18:51.16 --> 00:18:53.68
You're not money's at today.

360
00:18:53.68 --> 00:18:54.68
No idea.

361
00:18:54.68 --> 00:18:55.68
Yeah.

362
00:18:55.68 --> 00:18:56.68
Yeah.

363
00:18:56.68 --> 00:18:58.08
Does, did Budweiser get any of that money?

364
00:18:58.08 --> 00:18:59.08
You know, no.

365
00:18:59.08 --> 00:19:00.08
No.

366
00:19:00.08 --> 00:19:01.08
I'm actually, I'm not a beer.

367
00:19:01.08 --> 00:19:02.08
Not a booser.

368
00:19:02.08 --> 00:19:03.08
Oh, whoa.

369
00:19:03.08 --> 00:19:04.08
Oh, whoa.

370
00:19:04.08 --> 00:19:05.08
Oh, whoa.

371
00:19:05.08 --> 00:19:06.08
Oh, no.

372
00:19:06.08 --> 00:19:07.08
No, that's not good.

373
00:19:07.08 --> 00:19:08.08
That far.

374
00:19:08.08 --> 00:19:09.08
I'm a whiskey fan.

375
00:19:09.08 --> 00:19:10.08
Okay.

376
00:19:10.08 --> 00:19:14.08
But, uh, no, I mean, I just, I saw a way to pay my bills back.

377
00:19:14.08 --> 00:19:16.44
I saw a way to travel and do some more fun stuff.

378
00:19:16.44 --> 00:19:17.44
I went there to be in like Tritian.

379
00:19:17.44 --> 00:19:19.08
And they showed me airborne videos.

380
00:19:19.08 --> 00:19:20.28
I was like, I want that.

381
00:19:20.28 --> 00:19:21.28
Oh, yeah.

382
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:22.28
Deal.

383
00:19:22.28 --> 00:19:23.28
Deal.

384
00:19:23.28 --> 00:19:24.28
What's that called?

385
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:25.28
Bait and sweatshirt.

386
00:19:25.28 --> 00:19:26.28
Yeah.

387
00:19:26.28 --> 00:19:27.28
Yeah.

388
00:19:27.28 --> 00:19:28.04
But I really want to do is I want to get a good, um, thing, you know, when I can carry on in this

389
00:19:28.04 --> 00:19:31.04
feeling life and have a good trade that you have that I can bring back this feeling.

390
00:19:31.04 --> 00:19:33.04
I don't know what they're like, watch this video.

391
00:19:33.04 --> 00:19:34.04
You're like, yes.

392
00:19:34.04 --> 00:19:35.04
Yes.

393
00:19:35.04 --> 00:19:36.04
That's me.

394
00:19:36.04 --> 00:19:37.04
That's all.

395
00:19:37.04 --> 00:19:40.04
So, it showed you an, uh, is it like airborne recruiting video?

396
00:19:40.04 --> 00:19:45.28
Um, well, to be honest with you, I was a ranger, regimen, recruiting video and I signed

397
00:19:45.28 --> 00:19:48.72
up for all that, but then all the rumors were like, if you don't make it, you're going

398
00:19:48.72 --> 00:19:50.76
to create a, and I'm like, I don't want to go to Korea.

399
00:19:50.76 --> 00:19:51.76
Yeah.

400
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:55.24
And then 22 of my friends went to Fort Bragg because you got to pick a dude's stations

401
00:19:55.24 --> 00:19:56.72
they were filling up the new brigades.

402
00:19:56.72 --> 00:19:57.72
Yeah.

403
00:19:57.72 --> 00:20:00.08
And they're like, oh, you guys, we need you to fill in here and you can pick where you go.

404
00:20:00.08 --> 00:20:01.76
So, all of us from basic training went.

405
00:20:01.76 --> 00:20:02.76
Because what year was this?

406
00:20:02.76 --> 00:20:03.76
Uh, 2006.

407
00:20:03.76 --> 00:20:04.76
Oh, yeah.

408
00:20:04.76 --> 00:20:08.76
So, that's, so that's totally different from me because I joined the Navy in 1990.

409
00:20:08.76 --> 00:20:09.76
Oh, yeah.

410
00:20:09.76 --> 00:20:11.60
That's before I was even a cry stage champion.

411
00:20:11.60 --> 00:20:12.60
Yeah.

412
00:20:12.60 --> 00:20:13.60
Yeah.

413
00:20:13.60 --> 00:20:14.60
We're talking all this.

414
00:20:14.60 --> 00:20:15.60
Yeah.

415
00:20:15.60 --> 00:20:16.60
So, there was no war going on.

416
00:20:16.60 --> 00:20:20.32
And even though in my mind, I always thought like the seals were just like fighting

417
00:20:20.32 --> 00:20:24.04
wars worldwide at all times, which was not true.

418
00:20:24.04 --> 00:20:25.28
But I thought that.

419
00:20:25.28 --> 00:20:29.12
But yeah, it wasn't like, everyone that was joining the military, it's not like when you

420
00:20:29.12 --> 00:20:32.64
guys joined, your generation of people joined, you knew you were going to war.

421
00:20:32.64 --> 00:20:33.64
Oh, absolutely.

422
00:20:33.64 --> 00:20:34.64
100%.

423
00:20:34.64 --> 00:20:39.48
You know, the biggest regret I actually do have and not to kiss up to what you've done,

424
00:20:39.48 --> 00:20:44.68
but it's not tried to go to the Rangers or Ghost Special Forces or to see, like,

425
00:20:44.68 --> 00:20:46.52
I didn't even try, I wish I would have.

426
00:20:46.52 --> 00:20:49.64
Well, you would have, did you start thinking about that further in your career?

427
00:20:49.64 --> 00:20:50.64
Absolutely.

428
00:20:50.64 --> 00:20:54.48
I was going to come back and I was either going to go to Cruder and get my last year

429
00:20:54.48 --> 00:20:55.48
and a half a college.

430
00:20:55.48 --> 00:20:56.96
I went to college when I could.

431
00:20:56.96 --> 00:20:58.80
I took college out on investments.

432
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:03.20
And I was going to try to go recruited to go ahead and get my degree and then go to the

433
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:07.08
Special Operations World because if you don't do it that way, if you become an officer,

434
00:21:07.08 --> 00:21:08.88
you got to go back through the queue.

435
00:21:08.88 --> 00:21:09.88
Okay.

436
00:21:09.88 --> 00:21:14.92
But there's either going to be go rights to Special Operations and try that out or go

437
00:21:14.92 --> 00:21:16.08
become an officer and then go.

438
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:19.32
But yeah, just, you know, I don't know.

439
00:21:19.32 --> 00:21:20.72
I have no excuses for that.

440
00:21:20.72 --> 00:21:21.72
It's a weird thing.

441
00:21:21.72 --> 00:21:22.72
It's a weird thing.

442
00:21:22.72 --> 00:21:28.08
And I don't really like, anybody, like, I was, if you compare you as an athlete in high school

443
00:21:28.08 --> 00:21:30.68
and me as an athlete in high school, it's not even comparable.

444
00:21:30.68 --> 00:21:33.32
You were like 10 times the athlete I was.

445
00:21:33.32 --> 00:21:37.16
For some reason, I was stupid enough to think like I can make it through that training.

446
00:21:37.16 --> 00:21:40.12
And you weren't smart enough to go like, I can make that through the training.

447
00:21:40.12 --> 00:21:41.12
Because you would.

448
00:21:41.12 --> 00:21:45.16
And the saddest thing is with the whole the Ranger contract I had and all these guys were

449
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:48.000
going and I got talked to my buddies and going in Fort Bragg.

450
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.88
I ran to the bunch of them and they're like, oh yeah, we made it.

451
00:21:49.88 --> 00:21:53.000
I was like, oh my gosh, I could have, I was, you know, I was interested in it.

452
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.80
It's an interesting, it's an interesting, it's actually humility.

453
00:21:56.80 --> 00:22:02.80
It's you being like, hey man, you know, I don't know, I played football and baseball and

454
00:22:02.80 --> 00:22:03.80
ran track.

455
00:22:03.80 --> 00:22:04.80
Was that right?

456
00:22:04.80 --> 00:22:05.80
Well, I'm basketball.

457
00:22:05.80 --> 00:22:07.40
Football baseball and basketball.

458
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:09.32
I'm a great athlete, but I might not make it through.

459
00:22:09.32 --> 00:22:12.16
That's actually a form of humility, you know?

460
00:22:12.16 --> 00:22:13.16
I think it is.

461
00:22:13.16 --> 00:22:14.80
I was just, yeah, I don't know where I had was that.

462
00:22:14.80 --> 00:22:17.84
I just, I, you know, looking back now, I'm embarrassed about it a little bit.

463
00:22:17.84 --> 00:22:19.68
I wish I, I wish I were to went and try it out.

464
00:22:19.68 --> 00:22:21.44
I mean, I live a really good life.

465
00:22:21.44 --> 00:22:22.68
I have a wonderful life and everything.

466
00:22:22.68 --> 00:22:23.68
Not to jump ahead.

467
00:22:23.68 --> 00:22:24.88
Two beautiful children.

468
00:22:24.88 --> 00:22:25.88
So life's good.

469
00:22:25.88 --> 00:22:27.44
His bad is a situation.

470
00:22:27.44 --> 00:22:33.08
I, you know, I found myself in an April of 2012, but look back, I wish I would have tried

471
00:22:33.08 --> 00:22:34.08
something.

472
00:22:34.08 --> 00:22:35.08
Yeah.

473
00:22:35.08 --> 00:22:36.08
Yeah.

474
00:22:36.08 --> 00:22:39.12
I mean, but the 80 second airborne is which is where you ended up is freaking awesome

475
00:22:39.12 --> 00:22:40.12
unit.

476
00:22:40.12 --> 00:22:41.12
Oh, yeah.

477
00:22:41.12 --> 00:22:42.12
I mean, I think it's cool.

478
00:22:42.12 --> 00:22:44.80
And everybody's like, all about standards.

479
00:22:44.80 --> 00:22:49.04
How do you like, and this is something I, because a lot of people that listen to podcast,

480
00:22:49.04 --> 00:22:51.64
they join the military, believe it or not.

481
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:55.60
And like, we just met a guy the other day who's going to September 18th going to the

482
00:22:55.60 --> 00:22:56.88
Marine Corps.

483
00:22:56.88 --> 00:23:01.48
But I always want to tell them like, when you show up to boot camp, it's going to be

484
00:23:01.48 --> 00:23:02.48
a shock to your system.

485
00:23:02.48 --> 00:23:03.48
Right?

486
00:23:03.48 --> 00:23:04.88
I mean, it is going to be, you're going to lack of sleep.

487
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:06.28
It's not going to be stuff that you're used to.

488
00:23:06.28 --> 00:23:09.80
It, it sounds like you got a little, you know, shock to your system.

489
00:23:09.80 --> 00:23:12.64
You showed up there of just normal military stuff.

490
00:23:12.64 --> 00:23:17.24
And I guess my point in saying that is when you show up to boot camp, boot camp is not going

491
00:23:17.24 --> 00:23:18.24
to be fun for you.

492
00:23:18.24 --> 00:23:19.24
It's going to be a transition.

493
00:23:19.24 --> 00:23:21.24
I mean, you can mentally prepare all day.

494
00:23:21.24 --> 00:23:23.84
You know, and then you get yelled at and you're like, why is it guy always?

495
00:23:23.84 --> 00:23:24.84
Yeah.

496
00:23:24.84 --> 00:23:25.84
I didn't, I didn't do any wrong.

497
00:23:25.84 --> 00:23:26.84
Leave me alone.

498
00:23:26.84 --> 00:23:28.24
They made me eat coldslaw.

499
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:29.24
I don't even like coldslaw.

500
00:23:29.24 --> 00:23:33.24
I mean, the first thing like I come out and they're like, I guess coldslaw, if I

501
00:23:33.24 --> 00:23:34.24
launch, I'm like shit.

502
00:23:34.24 --> 00:23:35.24
I don't.

503
00:23:35.24 --> 00:23:36.24
I don't.

504
00:23:36.24 --> 00:23:37.24
So they put it on my plate.

505
00:23:37.24 --> 00:23:38.24
And then after I eat the coldslaw, I eat first.

506
00:23:38.24 --> 00:23:40.24
I'm like, he must be eating this for the reason.

507
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:41.24
So I'm just just, do this.

508
00:23:41.24 --> 00:23:43.24
And then the next time I dinner, I'm like, okay, finally no coldslaw.

509
00:23:43.24 --> 00:23:45.24
It's like, middle is a big bastard.

510
00:23:45.24 --> 00:23:47.24
You, first, I remember you, you get to school.

511
00:23:47.24 --> 00:23:48.24
You're coldslaw.

512
00:23:48.24 --> 00:23:51.24
Yeah.

513
00:23:51.24 --> 00:23:52.24
Right.

514
00:23:52.24 --> 00:23:53.24
You know, so.

515
00:23:53.24 --> 00:23:54.24
Yeah.

516
00:23:54.24 --> 00:23:55.24
Yeah.

517
00:23:55.24 --> 00:23:56.24
That's, that's bootcamp, right?

518
00:23:56.24 --> 00:23:57.24
Yeah.

519
00:23:57.24 --> 00:23:58.24
That's pretty good.

520
00:23:58.24 --> 00:24:00.24
I always felt when I talked to people that are going, I'm like, just play the game.

521
00:24:00.24 --> 00:24:01.24
Yeah.

522
00:24:01.24 --> 00:24:02.24
Understand, it's going to end and make the army.

523
00:24:02.24 --> 00:24:03.24
What you can make it.

524
00:24:03.24 --> 00:24:04.24
Like, make it work for you.

525
00:24:04.24 --> 00:24:06.24
Understand the job you're getting yourself into.

526
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:09.24
And things like that because people ask, would you still join if you know what happened?

527
00:24:09.24 --> 00:24:11.24
I said, yeah, absolutely I would.

528
00:24:11.24 --> 00:24:13.24
I enjoyed every second.

529
00:24:13.24 --> 00:24:14.24
I was going to be a 20 year guy.

530
00:24:14.24 --> 00:24:16.24
I figured I really listed it.

531
00:24:16.24 --> 00:24:17.24
And just, you know.

532
00:24:17.24 --> 00:24:18.24
It's cool.

533
00:24:18.24 --> 00:24:22.24
This is a cool thing that you wrote kind of as you're wrapping a bootcamp.

534
00:24:22.24 --> 00:24:24.24
You're thinking about September 11th.

535
00:24:24.24 --> 00:24:29.24
You know, like I said, that for you is one of you clearly knew that going in in 2006.

536
00:24:29.24 --> 00:24:30.24
And here's what you said.

537
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:38.24
I remember feeling a ragged mix of emotions, anger, confusion, dismay, and wondering why anybody would want to do this to us.

538
00:24:38.24 --> 00:24:40.24
I was American.

539
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:44.24
I understood we'd been attacked and that our country was now at war.

540
00:24:44.24 --> 00:24:58.24
And that when there's a war, somebody needs to have the courage and intestinal where we're fall to do the actual defending, fighting, and unavoidable killing that a company military actions.

541
00:24:58.24 --> 00:25:02.24
That would turn out to be me.

542
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:06.24
And that's another thing that people need to think about if you're doing it in the military.

543
00:25:06.24 --> 00:25:09.24
And I've gone through this with a bunch of people that, you know, this happened a year long time ago.

544
00:25:09.24 --> 00:25:13.24
This parent, you know, said, can you come talk to my son and he really wants to be a seal?

545
00:25:13.24 --> 00:25:15.24
And I was like, yeah, sure, no problem.

546
00:25:15.24 --> 00:25:22.24
And so I meet this kid, strapping young kid, looks super happy and positive, and he does water polo, and he's a great athlete.

547
00:25:22.24 --> 00:25:24.24
And he's like, I really want to join the seal teams.

548
00:25:24.24 --> 00:25:26.24
You know, what advice do you have from him?

549
00:25:26.24 --> 00:25:28.24
Are you ready to kill people?

550
00:25:28.24 --> 00:25:29.24
And are you ready to die?

551
00:25:29.24 --> 00:25:33.24
And it was like the whole room got wild just them too, but they're looking at me like, I'm crazy.

552
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:38.24
But my point was, like, that's what the military is.

553
00:25:38.24 --> 00:25:40.24
You kill people in your risk of your life.

554
00:25:40.24 --> 00:25:42.24
That's what the military is.

555
00:25:42.24 --> 00:25:48.24
I mean, yeah, absolutely, they have the combat and non-combat MMSs, you know, just in every

556
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:49.24
Every service.

557
00:25:49.24 --> 00:25:52.24
So with the seal teams with the infantry, that's what your job is.

558
00:25:52.24 --> 00:25:55.24
And you're willing to risk your life for others.

559
00:25:55.24 --> 00:26:00.24
I mean, it's just when I signed up, I was like, yeah, I'm ready to do this, but you never really understand everything.

560
00:26:00.24 --> 00:26:03.24
And then when you go through base training, they show you all these videos.

561
00:26:03.24 --> 00:26:08.24
And a lot of it, they showed a lot of band of brother stuff, which is what got me interested in going into the military.

562
00:26:08.24 --> 00:26:12.24
And I just took it as like, this is what I was wanting to do.

563
00:26:12.24 --> 00:26:13.24
This is awesome.

564
00:26:13.24 --> 00:26:14.24
But I get what you're saying.

565
00:26:14.24 --> 00:26:16.24
And people ask me, can you talk to myself, I'm not a doing this?

566
00:26:16.24 --> 00:26:18.24
No, no, no.

567
00:26:18.24 --> 00:26:20.24
You can't talk to people.

568
00:26:20.24 --> 00:26:22.24
You're young man on a doing this stuff.

569
00:26:22.24 --> 00:26:25.24
You're fine people that want to tell you, like, well, I was going to join, but then I did this.

570
00:26:25.24 --> 00:26:27.24
And I'm like, I don't care.

571
00:26:27.24 --> 00:26:30.24
Like, don't, you know, and everybody I talked to, not everybody, but I've got to talk to

572
00:26:30.24 --> 00:26:32.24
They got to give me their worst story possible.

573
00:26:32.24 --> 00:26:36.24
And I'm like, oh, I got a brother's friend that lost two legs, you know,

574
00:26:36.24 --> 00:26:38.24
and a bear trap.

575
00:26:38.24 --> 00:26:39.24
Okay.

576
00:26:39.24 --> 00:26:41.24
So I know what you're going through.

577
00:26:41.24 --> 00:26:43.24
I don't, okay.

578
00:26:43.24 --> 00:26:45.24
That works for me, I guess.

579
00:26:45.24 --> 00:26:47.24
Do you watch out for them bear traps?

580
00:26:47.24 --> 00:26:48.24
I know, sneak up on you.

581
00:26:48.24 --> 00:26:49.24
My brother's friend.

582
00:26:49.24 --> 00:26:50.24
That was crazy.

583
00:26:50.24 --> 00:26:53.24
I met him one time, but I give what your, I don't know exactly what you're doing.

584
00:26:53.24 --> 00:26:54.24
Okay.

585
00:26:54.24 --> 00:26:56.24
Dude, this cracked me up.

586
00:26:56.24 --> 00:26:58.24
You're at Airborne School.

587
00:26:58.24 --> 00:27:00.24
Most, you're, you're doing your first jumps.

588
00:27:00.24 --> 00:27:02.24
You five jumps at Airborne School.

589
00:27:02.24 --> 00:27:04.24
Most back to the book, most were without incident,

590
00:27:04.24 --> 00:27:08.24
except my third jump, which was supposed to be a daytime combat jump with full gear.

591
00:27:08.24 --> 00:27:10.24
On the way down, I dropped my rocks act too slowly.

592
00:27:10.24 --> 00:27:13.24
You're supposed to release it when you come to the tree line,

593
00:27:13.24 --> 00:27:15.24
but when I release the pack, it stayed just ahead of me,

594
00:27:15.24 --> 00:27:18.24
and I landed on top of the metal frame.

595
00:27:18.24 --> 00:27:19.24
Frame.

596
00:27:19.24 --> 00:27:20.24
Ouch, I yelled in pain.

597
00:27:20.24 --> 00:27:23.24
The jump master was already on the ground and yelled back at me.

598
00:27:23.24 --> 00:27:25.24
Did you bring something private Mills?

599
00:27:25.24 --> 00:27:28.24
I said, no, he glared at me and added,

600
00:27:28.24 --> 00:27:29.24
the shut up.

601
00:27:29.24 --> 00:27:30.24
I shut up.

602
00:27:30.24 --> 00:27:33.24
Airborne School's real good.

603
00:27:33.24 --> 00:27:34.24
Airborne School's really funny.

604
00:27:34.24 --> 00:27:36.24
And so this is what happened to me at Airborne School.

605
00:27:36.24 --> 00:27:38.24
I was, for if, I'm not like,

606
00:27:38.24 --> 00:27:42.24
I'm a person that falls fast through the air when parachuting.

607
00:27:42.24 --> 00:27:43.24
I don't know why.

608
00:27:43.24 --> 00:27:44.24
I'm just one of those people.

609
00:27:44.24 --> 00:27:45.24
You don't float.

610
00:27:45.24 --> 00:27:46.24
No, I don't float.

611
00:27:46.24 --> 00:27:50.24
And the other thing was, I didn't like doing a PLF,

612
00:27:50.24 --> 00:27:52.24
which is the proper way to land,

613
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:53.24
which is you keep your feet knees together,

614
00:27:53.24 --> 00:27:55.24
and then you like act like you have one big leg,

615
00:27:55.24 --> 00:27:58.24
and that's the way you're supposed to prevent getting injured,

616
00:27:58.24 --> 00:28:00.24
break in your ankle or knee or whatever.

617
00:28:00.24 --> 00:28:02.24
And so when I was parachuting at Airborne School,

618
00:28:02.24 --> 00:28:03.24
I wasn't really doing a PLF.

619
00:28:03.24 --> 00:28:06.24
I was just kind of athletically landing on my feet, right?

620
00:28:06.24 --> 00:28:11.24
So anyways, they got these loudspeakers down on the field.

621
00:28:11.24 --> 00:28:13.24
And as all these new guys, all of us are just new.

622
00:28:13.24 --> 00:28:15.24
And the guys on the megaphone, he goes,

623
00:28:15.24 --> 00:28:17.24
and he's talking to me because my feet are apart.

624
00:28:17.24 --> 00:28:19.24
And I'm just going to do an athletic lady goes.

625
00:28:19.24 --> 00:28:21.24
Feet knees together, Airborne.

626
00:28:21.24 --> 00:28:22.24
Feet knees together, Airborne.

627
00:28:22.24 --> 00:28:23.24
Feet knees together, Airborne.

628
00:28:23.24 --> 00:28:24.24
Feet knees together, Airborne.

629
00:28:24.24 --> 00:28:26.24
You all right, Airborne?

630
00:28:26.24 --> 00:28:30.24
So, yeah, I thought that was funny.

631
00:28:30.24 --> 00:28:33.24
Did it hurt?

632
00:28:33.24 --> 00:28:34.24
No, I didn't get hurt.

633
00:28:34.24 --> 00:28:35.24
That's impressive.

634
00:28:35.24 --> 00:28:38.24
Because I was actually a jump master.

635
00:28:38.24 --> 00:28:40.24
Very towards the end of my military.

636
00:28:40.24 --> 00:28:41.24
Yeah, that was in.

637
00:28:41.24 --> 00:28:44.24
And got the balls of feet calf.

638
00:28:44.24 --> 00:28:46.24
I had an ulna that you dialed.

639
00:28:46.24 --> 00:28:49.24
Those instructors, how long is the jump master school

640
00:28:49.24 --> 00:28:51.24
to be an instructor at forebending?

641
00:28:51.24 --> 00:28:53.24
Well, it's completely different.

642
00:28:53.24 --> 00:28:55.24
So, I mean, it's not that much different, I guess.

643
00:28:55.24 --> 00:28:57.24
But for me, it was like a three-week course,

644
00:28:57.24 --> 00:28:58.24
and I was able to like check people's equipment.

645
00:28:58.24 --> 00:29:01.24
But they didn't make you memorize the term, and all they did did.

646
00:29:01.24 --> 00:29:02.24
Did they?

647
00:29:02.24 --> 00:29:05.24
You got to memorize the pre-jump brief and everything and stuff

648
00:29:05.24 --> 00:29:10.24
at that, but no, like this is a nylon stitch with 5,000 drain tests

649
00:29:10.24 --> 00:29:12.24
and steel that's stronger than America.

650
00:29:12.24 --> 00:29:15.24
So, that's no way it's stronger than America.

651
00:29:15.24 --> 00:29:16.24
No way.

652
00:29:16.24 --> 00:29:19.24
But no, they don't do that to you.

653
00:29:19.24 --> 00:29:22.24
Yeah, that's a good time.

654
00:29:24.24 --> 00:29:27.24
You're getting ready for your first deployment.

655
00:29:27.24 --> 00:29:30.24
I'm going to show you about 80 second ever one.

656
00:29:30.24 --> 00:29:31.24
You're there.

657
00:29:31.24 --> 00:29:33.24
You're getting ready for your first deployment.

658
00:29:33.24 --> 00:29:35.24
You know you're going to Afghanistan.

659
00:29:35.24 --> 00:29:38.24
And you're leaving just after Christmas.

660
00:29:38.24 --> 00:29:40.24
And here we're going to the book.

661
00:29:40.24 --> 00:29:43.24
My dad didn't talk to me about leaving.

662
00:29:43.24 --> 00:29:45.24
Over the next few days, we hung out,

663
00:29:45.24 --> 00:29:47.24
and did whenever we normally did.

664
00:29:47.24 --> 00:29:49.24
But most he said during that time was,

665
00:29:49.24 --> 00:29:52.24
be sure to keep your head down.

666
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:54.24
Then the day before I left,

667
00:29:54.24 --> 00:29:59.76
story about when he went into the army. He'd taken Waspill paint and written a note to his

668
00:29:59.76 --> 00:30:05.24
parents and their shower stall where they were sure to be able to see it. It said one

669
00:30:05.24 --> 00:30:13.20
short sentence of reassurance, all will be fine. Early the morning that I left, I took a

670
00:30:13.20 --> 00:30:18.08
Waspill marker and went into my parents' bathroom, right above the faucets where they

671
00:30:18.08 --> 00:30:25.76
were sure to see it. I wrote the same short message, all will be fine. I was miles away

672
00:30:25.76 --> 00:30:32.40
from the house where my dad called. He told me he saw the note. I didn't say much and he

673
00:30:32.40 --> 00:30:39.44
didn't say much. He told me, love me, then his voice became horse and his words of support

674
00:30:39.44 --> 00:30:50.72
for me came out broken and choked. First time going on the point. It was a little rough too

675
00:30:50.72 --> 00:30:56.80
because I got from my hometown, a Marine, he was a body of mine. He has my baseball coach,

676
00:30:56.80 --> 00:31:01.36
his brother was in my grade. On the day after Christmas on the 26th he got shot by a sniper

677
00:31:01.36 --> 00:31:07.04
and I rack and ended up right through his heart and he didn't make it home. So, my brother

678
00:31:07.04 --> 00:31:13.36
actually has girlfriend that Chris is a little sister and she was at my house and I found out

679
00:31:13.36 --> 00:31:18.40
from friends that what had happened before the family found out, from people that were deployed

680
00:31:18.40 --> 00:31:24.80
with the unit. That was rough in my parents to have me in a couple of weeks going overseas and

681
00:31:24.80 --> 00:31:28.56
then I'm at home and they have to Christmas. Guy got shot that I know.

682
00:31:28.56 --> 00:31:36.24
Yeah, there's one, I think that's one of the hardest things for when military families see

683
00:31:37.68 --> 00:31:44.72
someone wounded or killed. They know that that could be their loved one. That's why I mean,

684
00:31:44.72 --> 00:31:50.80
days before you're leaving, man. That's harsh. And then we're close friends with the family. Like I

685
00:31:50.80 --> 00:31:58.16
said, his dad coach me from 10 years old up to 14 and 14 or 15. But

686
00:31:58.16 --> 00:32:02.72
you know, knew the family are there well. So, so is a little rough and things like that for a bit

687
00:32:02.72 --> 00:32:07.28
on my parents. But, you know, people now when they see me, they say, hey, do you go and speak

688
00:32:07.28 --> 00:32:10.80
to a lot of military things? I'm like, you know, I don't really do that that much of they want me

689
00:32:10.80 --> 00:32:13.84
to come in that will, but I'm not sure, but guys going overseas want to see me on stage.

690
00:32:13.84 --> 00:32:18.56
Hey, guys, you're going to be a okay. You know, I mean, it's trying not throughout. I mean,

691
00:32:18.56 --> 00:32:22.48
I thought a lot of companies, but when it comes down that, I'm like, hey, guys, you'll be good

692
00:32:22.48 --> 00:32:26.72
over there. It's like some movie that that six, I don't know what that is, but they're like,

693
00:32:26.72 --> 00:32:31.12
if Dream Amy the man I am today. Yeah, yeah, I've never seen it. But I get told that line.

694
00:32:31.12 --> 00:32:35.84
He's got like two fake legs. He's good. He's real good with movie quotes, especially bad movie.

695
00:32:35.84 --> 00:32:39.84
I'm so glad I forgot you were here. No, it's great. I've never known when chime in.

696
00:32:43.04 --> 00:32:46.08
So, your first deployment, what are you, are you an E3, E4?

697
00:32:46.96 --> 00:32:50.72
When I went over there, I think I was an E3. That's, I might have been an E2, actually.

698
00:32:50.72 --> 00:32:56.24
My favorite movie. Okay. I was only in a military six months for I to put it. That's crazy.

699
00:32:57.28 --> 00:33:01.76
Oh, it was a good time. I worked for a kernel. Yeah, I was doing basically PSD for the kernel, right?

700
00:33:01.76 --> 00:33:06.48
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, try being a young private, you go to a unit that's not an infantry. You don't

701
00:33:06.48 --> 00:33:12.80
get treated like crap. You work for a Lieutenant Colonel who's a direct descendant of

702
00:33:12.80 --> 00:33:17.44
Colonel Custer. He's a, it was his great uncle. The guy's just as wild. It's got a D.

703
00:33:17.44 --> 00:33:21.28
And he always walk around saying, what's better than a pair of vases, guys? Two pair and he

704
00:33:21.28 --> 00:33:26.80
show like the double A's on his own. And phenomenal guy, really. And we just go around with him.

705
00:33:26.80 --> 00:33:33.44
So, we ever got yelled at. My team leader was, was a cook, sergeant rush. Like, if we ever got yelled at,

706
00:33:33.44 --> 00:33:36.40
he just go with a kernel. But like, hey, so they're bothering us in the kernel. But like, don't

707
00:33:36.40 --> 00:33:40.64
do the doctor, my guys. I'm like, this is so nice being protected. I literally occur in our

708
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:45.28
house. So that was a relatively cush. And you were living on a, if you're, if you're the kernel, I'm assuming

709
00:33:45.28 --> 00:33:49.92
you were living in like pretty good. Fob's learned. Oh, yeah. And they have like hard buildings on the head tents.

710
00:33:49.92 --> 00:33:56.000
We were in the very first hard building. Oh, we all went in and bought satellite internet. I had a shower

711
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
every day. Hot meals. How often are you rolling out in the town? Every day. Okay. But we go out to

712
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.44
government work and come back. Okay. You know, and that was in the gym. I'd go at eight

713
00:34:05.44 --> 00:34:09.28
clock. I don't like being the gym with people. I got was like, I don't know, I'm in my machines.

714
00:34:09.28 --> 00:34:13.84
And I super said it a lot. So I go from eight to 11 at night, just crush it and then midnight

715
00:34:13.84 --> 00:34:19.12
child, which is like the greatest thing ever. No crowd. Oh, you just, you're like, I was like, I'm

716
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:25.44
let's air in hot wings. You know, you get the combo breakfast and dinner scenario going down. I know

717
00:34:25.44 --> 00:34:29.92
you're a much cooler guy than me, but when you get the midnight child of five, so I'm sorry. So I

718
00:34:29.92 --> 00:34:35.92
went to the hot wings. I'll take pancakes and. And I want to show some mashed potatoes and

719
00:34:35.92 --> 00:34:42.96
just go around that. And you guys, it sounds like on that first of all, you didn't, you didn't even

720
00:34:42.96 --> 00:34:48.24
shoot. You even shoot your gun first. I didn't have to. I was on patrols every day. I had a suicide

721
00:34:48.24 --> 00:34:53.04
bomber run off the bus and like detonate on the front of our truck. It's just like an idiot.

722
00:34:53.04 --> 00:34:58.000
You know, not even like, you know, it's nutsax hanging off the light and is, you know, but he's just

723
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.96
the truck's not hurting. It's like genius bro. Genius job well done. A for effort. Yeah. Like a

724
00:35:04.96 --> 00:35:12.08
effort judgment. Yeah. Yeah. But still, that, I mean, that that having a suicide bomber hit your truck,

725
00:35:13.84 --> 00:35:18.32
that's like a, that's at least a reality check out a minimum. Right. Well, I mean, yeah, so it was, it was

726
00:35:18.32 --> 00:35:24.08
our, our, one of our, our front trucks. And then also we had a guy run up on the Colonel,

727
00:35:24.08 --> 00:35:30.000
open in the hospital and detonate himself. I was in the truck at that time like in the gun. But we just found

728
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
out if we go out there, we just make sure they're right now. We're really aware every time we take a turn,

729
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.12
you know, our guns are rotating. We're not sleeping. We're up and out. We didn't really get messed with.

730
00:35:39.12 --> 00:35:45.52
And that, and that helped. I mean, I was, you know, I was in a place where there was bombs and things

731
00:35:45.52 --> 00:35:49.52
like that. But I was protected. You know, EOD would roll out before the Colonel went anywhere.

732
00:35:49.52 --> 00:35:55.12
Oh, that's right. Yeah. How many gun trucks did you take on a convoy? Just the coral.

733
00:35:55.12 --> 00:35:59.04
Just four of us. Would him and the three truck or two truck? He was in the two. I was just

734
00:35:59.04 --> 00:36:06.80
around at the first like six months. Nice. And then I was a, I moved to like be a TC. But the threat level was

735
00:36:06.80 --> 00:36:11.60
like medium. I mean, because you have to take a, yeah, you take a bigger convoy with more aggressive

736
00:36:12.56 --> 00:36:17.92
facilities. If I was in the home, it was at all homies. We were for like any other year. And I had a two

737
00:36:17.92 --> 00:36:23.04
four nine, like, as my, my main weapon had a saw. They're like, yeah, okay, the front truck, yep, 50

738
00:36:23.04 --> 00:36:28.72
kilo. A back truck, we're going to give you a mark. And you're just going to get a saw. That was like, oh,

739
00:36:28.72 --> 00:36:34.32
awesome. Thank you. So I had, I had a saw. That's what I put it up there. Like it was a big old gun.

740
00:36:35.20 --> 00:36:39.52
Yeah. That's awesome. Good times. Yeah. Why didn't they give you a real gun up there?

741
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:44.000
Uh, I'm really the, my boss were big enough. I was a real gun show.

742
00:36:45.20 --> 00:36:50.48
You know, I did not get that. I had 22 at the time. I got some supplements sent to the

743
00:36:50.48 --> 00:36:54.80
reason. That's that guy's found away from me to get some of their supplements. Wonderful.

744
00:36:56.56 --> 00:37:02.16
Uh, now, do you want to, for, is this this is the, this is the, you went for home for Aronaran.

745
00:37:02.72 --> 00:37:07.60
It is. And you had your first meeting. First meeting with one of your

746
00:37:07.60 --> 00:37:13.04
pertainmates, sisters. You know, I loved it. I loved it. And I got a my space frame request.

747
00:37:13.68 --> 00:37:19.04
And I thought, I mean, this must be a dating page. It was a, you know, Calgirl hat, brown,

748
00:37:19.04 --> 00:37:23.76
blouse for whatever gene skirt. I was like, that's a dating site. You know, this is an ad way to

749
00:37:23.76 --> 00:37:28.32
second. That last name is my medic. Let's do some investigation. He was home on Aronar.

750
00:37:29.12 --> 00:37:32.72
And I was looking through. I was like, that's his little sister. She's 18. So it's legal.

751
00:37:32.72 --> 00:37:38.08
And I was just like, except, you know, and we started chitchat. And I just did to make him mad,

752
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:41.76
you know, but we ended up enjoying the show as a company. And first time we ever met, I was like,

753
00:37:41.76 --> 00:37:45.92
I just a revocation. I've been here 11 and a half months. You know, I got coming home for

754
00:37:45.92 --> 00:37:51.12
for 18 days. You want to go on vacation? She's like, yeah, sure. So just I were going to go to

755
00:37:51.12 --> 00:37:57.28
Cosmo Mexico. How do you, how do you talk to her dad into that? She was 18. So she did what she wanted.

756
00:37:57.28 --> 00:38:02.80
Yes, I don't know. He didn't kill me. So, head in. Every right. And so you go to Mexico. It's your first

757
00:38:02.80 --> 00:38:06.88
date. So that's how I'm just going to take you to Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. You guys, I say I don't know that's

758
00:38:06.88 --> 00:38:12.16
24,000 dollars when I know exactly where I went to Mexico that back to Michigan for a week.

759
00:38:12.16 --> 00:38:17.12
I had a great time. She went back to Texas, had to go back overseas. I got held up in Atlanta.

760
00:38:17.12 --> 00:38:20.32
So I called her up. I was like, hey, I'm in Atlanta for the night you want to come. She said, yeah,

761
00:38:20.32 --> 00:38:24.48
so she came out next morning, Santa Claus crock it out to your streaming from her face.

762
00:38:25.52 --> 00:38:28.24
And she's like, I love you. And I'm like, I don't know where to get. So I love you too.

763
00:38:28.24 --> 00:38:33.04
Yeah, it's fast. I love you. I didn't pause. You know, and she's like, in between her sauce,

764
00:38:33.04 --> 00:38:36.88
I want to marry you. And I'm like, yeah, I get that. But you know, in my head, I said that

765
00:38:36.88 --> 00:38:42.96
because I was like, I want to marry you too. We're all castin' over here. Jump on that airplane,

766
00:38:42.96 --> 00:38:46.48
get back overseas, give her a call, right 24 hours later, and have a chance to end. I'm like, hey,

767
00:38:46.48 --> 00:38:50.40
what's going on, baby? She's like, guess what? I'm like, I don't know what. Weddings planned.

768
00:38:53.52 --> 00:38:59.36
Sales.com, butter ring, colder dad and whatnot. You know, I guess that's cool. I'm like, well,

769
00:38:59.36 --> 00:39:05.20
okay, thanks. Yeah. And then we got married. How did her brother feel about you? Was her brother

770
00:39:05.20 --> 00:39:09.28
in your photo? I was using my medic. Yeah. He actually wrote in the same truck as me. Oh,

771
00:39:09.28 --> 00:39:13.28
in my current, I would pick on him on the radio. Hey, buck, what do you think? Meals doing with your

772
00:39:13.28 --> 00:39:18.24
sister. I was like, I'm like, break my break. You can let that go. Because you mean, I'm standing

773
00:39:18.24 --> 00:39:22.16
up in the truck, you know, Josh can just, yeah, hand me the back seat and I'm like, no, no,

774
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:28.24
don't do this. Don't do this, sir. But, nah, he can't hear us. Good guy. He's like, he told

775
00:39:28.24 --> 00:39:32.08
his mom a day, he's like, look, I know how it looks. He's actually a good guy and really nice. So,

776
00:39:32.08 --> 00:39:36.000
we'll see how it works out. And then I ended up marrying her. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's awesome, man. That's

777
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.72
that's a great story to detail it in here that it's pretty, it's pretty unbelievable. You know,

778
00:39:44.72 --> 00:39:50.80
that you pulled all that off. Well, and the current was actually setting me up to go to the prep school

779
00:39:50.80 --> 00:39:55.04
engineer for West Point. He's like, usually we play in football on my, my lieutenant at the time.

780
00:39:56.40 --> 00:40:00.64
Lieutenant Philips, Tommy's a major, but maybe he's a Colonel now, but he was training me. He was

781
00:40:00.64 --> 00:40:05.60
football coach and he holds a record in Chicago. Yeah. Most consecutive losses at the school

782
00:40:05.60 --> 00:40:10.40
because he was coaching that in high school. Yeah, they were that bad. Great guy though. He was like,

783
00:40:10.40 --> 00:40:14.64
helping me coach and train up and lift weights and do whatever. But then I'm at Kelsey. I was like,

784
00:40:14.64 --> 00:40:20.88
I'm just going to do this. You know, so we got married. My God, back. How long after you went home

785
00:40:20.88 --> 00:40:26.56
for Christmas did you come back? I came back in April on the 13th, night 14th morning and then you

786
00:40:26.56 --> 00:40:31.20
won't find it in my book, but we got married the courthouse on the 17th. There you go. Yeah. And then we got

787
00:40:31.20 --> 00:40:35.12
married again. Yeah, like a great wedding engineer. Like good old smithier. Like that money. Well,

788
00:40:35.12 --> 00:40:39.68
I needed to spend all my money. You know, I was like, I don't know how we get a house. I'm like,

789
00:40:40.24 --> 00:40:43.28
I'm like, look, we need to, I need that be a age for you to months that they were just

790
00:40:43.28 --> 00:40:49.04
damn wedding. You know, so we can go to your right. In Texas in McKinney, about 112 that day.

791
00:40:49.84 --> 00:40:55.44
And then you settled down. And now you now you know you're standing at the army. You're pretty,

792
00:40:55.44 --> 00:40:58.64
pretty much saying I'm saying the army at this point. Well, I mean, I really enjoyed it. I got

793
00:40:58.64 --> 00:41:03.28
moved around another unit when I got back because I had to go to like a line unit could be a PSD

794
00:41:03.28 --> 00:41:07.44
guy that's all I mean, I was up for it. I was like, this is awesome. But yeah, we got to have an

795
00:41:07.44 --> 00:41:13.84
apartment in North Carolina, uh, right outside Fort Bragg there, bought a dog, um, life was good and

796
00:41:13.84 --> 00:41:19.12
I figured military is doing well and then just kind of hung out for 15 months or 18 months before

797
00:41:19.12 --> 00:41:22.88
I deployed. That's what I was going to say. So it's 18 months between deployments for you.

798
00:41:22.88 --> 00:41:27.92
Uh, it was that you usually a year and three months. So like I went for 15 months. So they gave me 18

799
00:41:27.92 --> 00:41:33.60
months off. I went for a year. And then I then gave me 15 months off that I had to go again for my

800
00:41:33.60 --> 00:41:41.04
third. But I'm jumping ahead here. So you you get back over on deployment. Um, and this is, uh, this is

801
00:41:41.04 --> 00:41:46.72
like within days that you, you'll tighten me up on that. But one of your, one of your friends

802
00:41:46.72 --> 00:41:54.32
Tyler Juden is saying that right? Mm-hmm. He's uh, out on a mount patrol, IED hits the first vehicle.

803
00:41:54.32 --> 00:41:58.56
Then they get a small, small arms ambush and I'm going to the book here. Our guys needed to get the

804
00:41:58.56 --> 00:42:03.20
disabled vehicle out of the way. And while they worked toward this objective, Tyler sprinted up to a

805
00:42:03.20 --> 00:42:08.48
high site on a nearby hill and fired through some five to seven magazines to ammo protecting his

806
00:42:08.48 --> 00:42:13.60
soldiers below when the disabled truck was finally cleared Tyler Sprinter back to the truck.

807
00:42:13.60 --> 00:42:20.40
Well, the enemy had specifically targeted him. An RPG flew in and he was hit. They rushed him back

808
00:42:20.40 --> 00:42:26.000
to the hospital at the fob, but it was too late. Tyler died on the operating table.

809
00:42:27.52 --> 00:42:33.52
Fury rose up inside of me. I wanted to find whatever taliban savages did this to Tyler and shoot

810
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:39.52
them in the face. Tyler was always cautious. He took his job extremely seriously and never made

811
00:42:39.52 --> 00:42:45.92
mistakes. There was no reason for him to die. He described to me once how he believed his job as a sniper

812
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:52.48
ultimately saved innocent lives. He was putting into practice what he knew to be true. He was helping

813
00:42:52.48 --> 00:42:57.52
the world, not hindering it and he'd been trained to be one of the rough men who stands ready in the

814
00:42:57.52 --> 00:43:02.48
night, prepared to do his duty, prepared to visit violence on those who would do us harm.

815
00:43:02.48 --> 00:43:10.08
Tyler's death hit far too close to home and we don't need just arrived.

816
00:43:12.40 --> 00:43:14.72
So that's not a fun way to kick off the point.

817
00:43:14.72 --> 00:43:19.44
No, and I don't know if he experienced in your unit, but it seems like the guys get hit are the ones

818
00:43:19.44 --> 00:43:25.04
that you don't expect to ever hit. So Tyler was a year older than me. I respected him.

819
00:43:25.04 --> 00:43:29.44
I mean, it was crazy because a guy's year older, it's like, well, whatever, but he had such

820
00:43:29.44 --> 00:43:33.52
a professionalism about him and I looked up to him and tried to learn what I could from him.

821
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:36.72
And he only had like a, he probably had an extra year and a half and the army then I did,

822
00:43:36.72 --> 00:43:42.48
but either way. And highly ranked sniper and he went up and just he didn't take bad shots.

823
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:45.36
So he was just popping everybody and they did tie a rhythm. He actually,

824
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.56
I'm pretty sure was a camp champ and that he, that I'm not sure if you ever been to the SF.

825
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:56.08
No, I have base there. Anyway, that's where you ended up not making. There's only two weeks

826
00:43:56.08 --> 00:44:00.56
into the point of that. And you know, when that guy like that gets hit, one,

827
00:44:00.56 --> 00:44:03.04
obviously frustrated and angry, you don't know why it happened, but two, it's like,

828
00:44:03.68 --> 00:44:08.64
well, geez, if he didn't get hit or taken out, you know, it kind of takes you down to confidence

829
00:44:08.64 --> 00:44:14.24
a pegrot, pegrot too as well because he's a guy you wouldn't expect. Not that you expect anybody

830
00:44:14.24 --> 00:44:20.32
to hit, I guess. But you know, like a super soldier style guy. Yeah, and I'm sure like,

831
00:44:20.32 --> 00:44:26.24
everybody, if you held him in that regard, everybody held him in that regard. And so everybody's

832
00:44:26.24 --> 00:44:33.04
feeling that same, oh, yeah. Kind of straight up nervousness, right? Yeah. And there was, he would walk by,

833
00:44:33.04 --> 00:44:37.12
like on our ACUs, like we have a strange post tucked a string in, some standard stuff.

834
00:44:37.12 --> 00:44:41.76
If my way would be hanging out, he'd walk by and hang on it and they make me do push ups and yell at me.

835
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:46.08
And I wanted to punch him in the face, but I couldn't, you know, and I understood why he was doing it.

836
00:44:46.08 --> 00:44:50.72
So, I just had fun story, I guess I'd tell people because I mean, if I could have decked in my pride,

837
00:44:50.72 --> 00:44:55.68
what? I've only been in one fistfight ever, I knocked myself out, playing volleyball.

838
00:44:56.72 --> 00:45:00.64
Tells it, that was the one. Yeah. It's sad, but true, it's in the book.

839
00:45:02.48 --> 00:45:05.68
I don't know what that. Really, you might as well tell it.

840
00:45:05.68 --> 00:45:09.04
Well, yeah, we were just playing volleyball and I forgot, man, I was going over the net. We made

841
00:45:09.04 --> 00:45:15.28
a wee 2-5-4 cables for the antennas we used those in 550 cord and it was like,

842
00:45:15.28 --> 00:45:18.24
good girl, we're net. I was 6 foot 3 and the net was only 6 foot tall, so I was like,

843
00:45:18.24 --> 00:45:23.84
just hammering it home and I had a vertical, you know, like the bronze. So, he's ridiculous,

844
00:45:24.40 --> 00:45:28.64
a whole belly button above the net and I kept going over and they kept yelling. So I pulled my

845
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:34.000
hand back real fast, and I caught myself right in the eye socket. Knocked out.

846
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.44
Do you actually knock yourself out? Yeah. But later on, when I had this happen, I did get knocked

847
00:45:41.44 --> 00:45:44.88
out. Yeah, that's like, keep imagine when the fist of fury could have done.

848
00:45:45.76 --> 00:45:50.000
Floyd Winner stood at chance against me. I don't know if I'm impressed if that's like super impressive

849
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.56
or super not impressive. Right. You either have the fist of iron or a glass jaw. We're not sure

850
00:45:54.56 --> 00:45:59.04
which. I hit a bomb. Yeah. And I didn't get knocked out, so my answer has been fist of iron. Yeah,

851
00:45:59.04 --> 00:46:03.92
the questions have been answered. Probably being jail right now, if I was, went fist of cuffs,

852
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:14.64
anybody. So, you, it sounds like, you guys ended up doing overwatches of a road in, um,

853
00:46:14.64 --> 00:46:21.52
what, up by, Zobsick Pass. Okay. Yeah. And, great time. How long were you on that for?

854
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:24.72
Well, we went out there and they were like, yeah, just go ahead and pack for a couple of weeks

855
00:46:24.72 --> 00:46:29.36
and then we were out there. I think 50, 50 days or so. And we just live on top of a mountain

856
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.44
and then like just monitoring the road. Yeah, just because they had, uh, they were bringing

857
00:46:33.44 --> 00:46:39.28
up convoy's and jingle trucks with military gear on to build another fob. And we had people on both

858
00:46:39.28 --> 00:46:44.80
sides and I actually, uh, a sofa ready to tell my wife I, I went down one day to get some food

859
00:46:44.80 --> 00:46:50.000
or something or get a resupply. And, uh, I'm going back up. They made a stop. They want to register

860
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.60
mortars. And I was like, what the, I just want to get back up there. I got out and I slammed my door

861
00:46:53.60 --> 00:46:57.52
and like the brilliant guy, I went ahead and used a fist if he had a hammer to hummer.

862
00:46:58.24 --> 00:47:02.08
And I ripped a scab open on my hand. I told the way my story to my wife. It was

863
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:06.32
somewhat blood. It was gushing as ridiculous. But, uh, as my wedding ring fingers, I took my

864
00:47:06.32 --> 00:47:09.92
wedding ring off put on the front of the hummer and I got the medic guys to get out of your

865
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:14.56
dock, you know, willis or whatever. I fixed this up for me and I had to put tape on. I got back in,

866
00:47:14.56 --> 00:47:18.24
left my wedding ring right on the front of that hummer and drove back out mountain. So, like,

867
00:47:18.24 --> 00:47:21.60
for 30, some days every time I got a chance to go down the mountain, I had a middle,

868
00:47:21.60 --> 00:47:24.56
the zector out like, please find this tungsten ring. Please, I don't want to tell my wife.

869
00:47:25.20 --> 00:47:34.32
I never heard of it. I was like to give people that didn't serve a little, you know,

870
00:47:34.32 --> 00:47:38.72
impression or of what it's like and I thought this wouldn't wrap that up pretty good.

871
00:47:38.72 --> 00:47:44.16
Going to the book here, going so long without taking a shower, came with a chair of complications.

872
00:47:44.16 --> 00:47:48.72
Guys got transferred from their feet being wet and sweaty and not taking care of them properly.

873
00:47:48.72 --> 00:47:53.12
I got strange rashes and intimate areas and it wasn't uncommon for a guy to

874
00:47:53.12 --> 00:47:59.12
mutter about his balls sticking to his leg when he hiked. Every dude got chafed up pretty badly

875
00:47:59.12 --> 00:48:06.40
in his bodily crevices and a common complaint was that a guy had swass slank for sweaty ass.

876
00:48:07.76 --> 00:48:14.80
My armpits hurt. I swed it so much that the salt got trapped in my skin and my back broke out

877
00:48:14.80 --> 00:48:21.76
in a raised bubbly rash. This happened to other guys too. The only solution is to get your ID card out

878
00:48:21.76 --> 00:48:26.000
and have another dude scrape your back hard until the salt crystals pop out.

879
00:48:27.04 --> 00:48:32.40
It's a brutal procedure and it feels like getting cut with a razor blade, but it's all part of the

880
00:48:32.40 --> 00:48:41.20
fun. Yeah. Day to day. Yeah. Day to day get something. I mean, sounds like I was complaining

881
00:48:41.20 --> 00:48:47.20
in that one. No. Yeah, watching someone like scrape salt crystals, like size of table salt

882
00:48:47.20 --> 00:48:51.84
come out. I'm not sure if you ever experienced it like that. No. But yeah, it's pretty bad and you

883
00:48:51.84 --> 00:48:56.80
get so grow. And then I took four real showers that year. Yeah. Like real ones. I mean, you

884
00:48:56.80 --> 00:49:00.64
go get a water bottle, poke holes in the top and spray yourself down. Then you have to get dirty

885
00:49:00.64 --> 00:49:04.72
all over again. It's just a long process. So you started to think of like how it takes like

886
00:49:04.72 --> 00:49:09.04
nine days or something for you get comfortable with your nasties. Yeah. And then you don't even

887
00:49:09.04 --> 00:49:12.40
want to break the cycle and get cleaning your skin. You know, you know, you need to use dirty

888
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:16.64
skin? No. The best part is like the winner because you don't smell as bad in the winter. Like

889
00:49:16.64 --> 00:49:20.08
when the winter you don't take showers like, oh, it doesn't matter. I brushed my teeth keeping

890
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:26.000
perley white. Maybe I teeth look wider. You know. But yeah, and I was pretty I actually decided

891
00:49:27.52 --> 00:49:32.32
halfway into that point. I was like, oh my wife just sent me eight pair of range of panties. So I

892
00:49:32.32 --> 00:49:36.16
wore a whole pair like range of panties for a month. And I just took them off. I was like, no,

893
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:40.72
I'm not going to wash these. Just don't worry. Except it and move on 12 bucks, well spent.

894
00:49:41.52 --> 00:49:47.68
So my effect, whereas the obzack passed my pants got so torn. They were like chaps. Like

895
00:49:47.68 --> 00:49:50.96
my butt cheeks were hanging out. So I went these sergeant majors came in. You know, and they're

896
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:55.92
all out of shape. Like, you already don't look back at dips. I know, I changed pants. I'm like

897
00:49:55.92 --> 00:49:59.04
sergeant major, if I change the pants, I'm like another pair of looks just like this. Like,

898
00:49:59.04 --> 00:50:03.12
it's that I'm not on the fob. There's you come into like, you got to get in the uniform and

899
00:50:03.12 --> 00:50:08.72
all that. I'm like, bring me one. I'm like, yeah, okay, let me do that. You got it, bud. I know you're

900
00:50:08.72 --> 00:50:13.36
going to get back in that truck and roll your ass out of here. So back to the chicken wings and

901
00:50:13.36 --> 00:50:22.80
pancakes. Oh, I know. A lot of MREs. That's good times. Yeah, you know, I got to just straight up.

902
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:30.32
I mean, in the sealed teams, we just don't have to eat that many MREs. That's the way it is.

903
00:50:30.32 --> 00:50:35.04
Yeah, to the either you make them, you can make those things delicious. Yeah, you can.

904
00:50:35.04 --> 00:50:43.44
That burrito. Get at me. Mixed a little bit in there. Yeah. I actually, my first deployment

905
00:50:43.44 --> 00:50:48.72
to Iraq, we ate MREs for a little while, and I was legitimately sick of them. And it was, it wasn't

906
00:50:48.72 --> 00:50:53.12
that long. But I was already sick of them. One, no, 50 days. I can promise you that.

907
00:50:53.52 --> 00:50:58.08
Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah. Yeah. You're just going to say something about the sealed

908
00:50:58.08 --> 00:51:02.64
teams. Why don't you? No, I would never. I don't have this period of

909
00:51:02.64 --> 00:51:07.84
spending myself. We're getting shipped in stakes. I'm like that. I mean, later on,

910
00:51:07.84 --> 00:51:11.44
that point, we had like stakes on like one day a week, they'd bring out like these frozen

911
00:51:11.44 --> 00:51:17.12
stakes. We could come over like an open pit of fire with a stick thrown. Yeah. Dude, it is legit.

912
00:51:17.12 --> 00:51:20.24
Like, I would go out to some rant. My first point, we'd go out to, because we were living

913
00:51:20.24 --> 00:51:24.88
at weird owned by, up and back, dad, big, jow haul, everything good. And we'd go out to

914
00:51:24.88 --> 00:51:30.40
do an op somewhere. There'd be some SF group in the middle of nowhere. And you'd see how

915
00:51:30.40 --> 00:51:34.000
they're living. I mean, it wasn't always an SF group. Some of us are, you know, some army

916
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.12
platoon or company out there in the middle of nowhere. And you're like, dang, these boys are

917
00:51:37.12 --> 00:51:42.000
roughing it nasty. And we're here like, they brought Gatorade, they brought a case. Yeah, I

918
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.68
gave me two. Give me two on the hide one of my pillow case. You'd feel bad. They'd

919
00:51:45.68 --> 00:51:49.12
go, oh, man, you're in the sealed teams. You're like, dude, I'm ashamed to do like, even

920
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:52.96
be hanging out with you right now. You guys smell so bad. I don't know why they brought me out.

921
00:51:52.96 --> 00:51:57.04
Yeah. You guys go sit over there. We're just going to sit here. Leave this alone. We need

922
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:01.68
you guys. Yeah. Do you know what? We've gone three days without a shower. This is crap, man.

923
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:09.68
Yeah, we did that. It's totally the same life. But, you know, within during the, I mean,

924
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:14.24
in during the soccer. It's still like, it's funny, like, my friend from high school, right?

925
00:52:14.88 --> 00:52:18.88
I have two really good friends I can talk with, whatever. But if I run to another person from high

926
00:52:18.88 --> 00:52:23.28
school or whatever, we'll catch up on everything. That's like, oh, great talking to you.

927
00:52:23.28 --> 00:52:26.48
You know, and then you find your way out of conversation, but you, friend, a military buddy,

928
00:52:26.48 --> 00:52:29.84
you haven't seen in years and you just go right back into it. You know, just because you

929
00:52:29.84 --> 00:52:31.92
understand where you've been with me. Yeah. Yeah.

930
00:52:34.08 --> 00:52:38.72
Speaking of going through stuff, here we go. Back to the book, the Taliban

931
00:52:38.72 --> 00:52:43.04
screech to a stop and started shooting at the AMP bullets cracked all around us. We got

932
00:52:43.04 --> 00:52:49.44
word from higher command to engage. I yelled to my men fire. We shot our rifles and shorts let loose

933
00:52:49.44 --> 00:52:54.96
with several bursts of machine gun, rat a tat, rat a tat, rat a tat, rat a tat tat.

934
00:52:55.68 --> 00:53:01.36
This is my first large scale firefight of any kind. It hit me with a wham that this wasn't

935
00:53:01.36 --> 00:53:05.92
really a training exercise anymore. This was the real deal. My adrenaline rose in where

936
00:53:05.92 --> 00:53:12.32
the surge of energy. But I also felt calm as if all my training kicked in at once. And I just did

937
00:53:12.32 --> 00:53:18.40
what I was trained to do. I honestly wasn't afraid. I took aim and fired at the bad guys. They

938
00:53:18.40 --> 00:53:22.56
fired at me and it didn't phase me to think that I might kill somebody when I wanted when they

939
00:53:22.56 --> 00:53:28.80
wanted to kill me first. I saw several Taliban members get hit and fall more fell and more.

940
00:53:29.52 --> 00:53:36.08
The last few who are left turned around and took off took off the waddy. We got word to get

941
00:53:36.08 --> 00:53:40.24
not to give chase because waddy's are great choke points for potential enemy ambushes.

942
00:53:40.24 --> 00:53:45.28
When the shooting died down completely we approached close enough to see the bodies of the

943
00:53:45.28 --> 00:53:51.28
enemy soldiers. I just helped kill. It was a surreal feeling but I reminded myself that this is

944
00:53:51.28 --> 00:53:58.08
what a soldiers are built to do. We received reports later that three of my men, the three of the men

945
00:53:58.72 --> 00:54:04.64
killed or top Taliban leaders in the region. So there's your first gunfight. Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

946
00:54:04.64 --> 00:54:11.28
So the A&P commander was a former Taliban guy. He switched over sides and ran around the

947
00:54:11.28 --> 00:54:14.24
A&P. He was like, yeah they're having a big meeting. I got a call. They're kind of coming

948
00:54:14.24 --> 00:54:19.52
on this waddy. We'll go check it out and then all of a sudden just drop in, you know, Martin 19

949
00:54:19.52 --> 00:54:27.12
and the 50 cal into 40 on him and just hey, you know, going nuts and then they come back and

950
00:54:27.12 --> 00:54:31.12
they're really good about taking their bodies away with them. They're pretty good about it but they

951
00:54:31.12 --> 00:54:38.08
were like 18 or 20 people deep in the in the waddy coming and we just led into them. And yeah, that was

952
00:54:38.08 --> 00:54:42.64
my first like real taste of like I shoot my gun at people. What were your team leader at this point?

953
00:54:43.36 --> 00:54:49.60
No, I was so I was actually a squad leader. I was I was a position up. So I was still in E5 but I was

954
00:54:49.60 --> 00:54:55.84
in a squad leader position. So I was tried to do a what a weapon squad? No, no, that we were actually

955
00:54:55.84 --> 00:55:00.24
we were mounted. Okay. So I had my own truck but I had two trucks that were under me. So I had two

956
00:55:01.28 --> 00:55:05.68
two trucks that were two teams. I had two team leaders that were underneath me and then we

957
00:55:05.68 --> 00:55:10.08
had a truck. So my senior like team leader had one, he was a T.C. of his truck man. I was a T.C.

958
00:55:10.08 --> 00:55:17.44
of the junior team leader that. Yeah. So it was a good time. Again, I said that. I'll speak in

959
00:55:17.44 --> 00:55:21.28
somewhere the other day and I said something along those lines and like somebody said like,

960
00:55:21.28 --> 00:55:25.84
I think it's kind of weird that you say it's a good time and fun and I'm like, well,

961
00:55:26.64 --> 00:55:29.52
it's a drilling rush. Not going to get it. It's a good time and fun. I mean,

962
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:39.28
they shot at me first. I mean, he started it. It's starting. Yeah, the fender self. But uh, yeah.

963
00:55:39.28 --> 00:55:45.12
And then I mean, yeah, it just doesn't, it didn't phase me. It didn't hit me hard. I wasn't

964
00:55:45.12 --> 00:55:51.92
worried about it. Um, just kept moving on. In fact, that region died right down like completely after

965
00:55:51.92 --> 00:55:56.16
this. Well, if you kill all those bad guys, it's just, yeah, it's just in fact. Like, uh, that was our

966
00:55:56.16 --> 00:55:59.84
first night out there too. Like, moved out to the middle of nowhere in the snowstorm and that was like,

967
00:55:59.84 --> 00:56:03.84
maybe I'm not first night or second night out there. We just shot everybody and then for the next

968
00:56:03.84 --> 00:56:06.64
like two months, it was quiet and they were like, they back filled us with some other

969
00:56:07.20 --> 00:56:10.40
patoon. And like, hey, we're going to bring in this patoon here. You guys are going to go up north

970
00:56:10.40 --> 00:56:15.04
where there's a lot of fighting in Baltimore. God. All right, cool. Let's do it. So that's that's the next

971
00:56:15.04 --> 00:56:21.60
big movement that you made. Who is that spot? And that place had a bad rep, like, as far as being

972
00:56:21.60 --> 00:56:26.000
a lot of fighting there. Uh, Obama guy was really heavy. Really heavy. It was, um, the Obama guy

973
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.84
of River. And when we got there, um, the Italians were there before us. And I guess they were just like,

974
00:56:31.84 --> 00:56:35.84
hey, tell me, don't mess with us. Here's, here's some money and we're good. And we're, uh, where

975
00:56:35.84 --> 00:56:41.76
the eight seconds. So we're like, no, not going to happen. And the infantry, between that we replaced,

976
00:56:41.76 --> 00:56:45.20
and I mean, for the record, I am infantry. I was in a cab unit, but they always have a

977
00:56:45.20 --> 00:56:49.84
trolley troop is infantry, but soon they bring in. And then we had these coin between us. I was

978
00:56:49.84 --> 00:56:55.28
like two infantry and two cab squads to make the tunes up. But um, yeah, we replaced these, uh, the

979
00:56:55.28 --> 00:56:58.56
infantry guys, they had two guys killed. Unfortunately, fell into a river. There was actually a

980
00:56:58.56 --> 00:57:04.16
ceasefire with a tail band to find the bodies and bring the bodies back. Um, and we got up there

981
00:57:04.16 --> 00:57:09.20
and there was like a line in the sand. They said, look, you cross this line. You're going to get shot at.

982
00:57:09.20 --> 00:57:16.72
And we were like, all right, cool. So we started taking ground. And um, everywhere, there's a

983
00:57:16.72 --> 00:57:21.04
fighting position on top of a mountain. They would booby trap it when they were done. So a guy, one of

984
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:25.92
the F.O.s sergeant Fox, good guy, he picked up a matchbox and he said, yep, I got a matchbox. It

985
00:57:25.92 --> 00:57:30.32
looks like, and then just they only found his torso. That was, you know, everything else was gone.

986
00:57:30.32 --> 00:57:37.36
Just his body armor. Um, but instead of staying in one spot at this one, we took one more spot.

987
00:57:37.36 --> 00:57:43.84
And they're like, yeah, well, some Marciac guys went up here. Was this the, uh, was these the strong points

988
00:57:43.84 --> 00:57:49.12
like Corvette and Impala? Is that what we're talking about now? Yeah. Yeah. These are in your book.

989
00:57:49.12 --> 00:57:54.56
Um, you talk about those being an Impala was the, the even worst one, even further

990
00:57:54.56 --> 00:57:58.32
than animatariory. Yeah, and they were like, yeah, we had like a Marciac guy got shot in the head

991
00:57:58.32 --> 00:58:02.72
when he was up there. Um, it was just like a eight man team that went in and they're like,

992
00:58:02.72 --> 00:58:05.76
you guys can't really go there. So we decided one night, we're going to go there. We'd

993
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:11.36
drink, we've got already for it. What was Impala physically? What is it like a little, uh,

994
00:58:11.36 --> 00:58:17.28
former like like house or something? There's actually absolutely there's a house. Um, and we

995
00:58:17.28 --> 00:58:20.56
decided we're going to take it one night because there was a last house in the edge of town. And then

996
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:24.88
there was 1200 meters between the next like village. And the Taliban would go in there and shoot

997
00:58:24.88 --> 00:58:32.24
it us and, you know, be able to sneak down a way far enough. And, uh, we had a javlin team come up

998
00:58:32.24 --> 00:58:35.92
on one side. We, we went up in the middle of night on this side. And we had other people on this side.

999
00:58:35.92 --> 00:58:40.96
And we just, we just took it, uh, middle of a night. And then they were said we're going to go there

1000
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:44.24
for like, you know, three days, do reconnaissance come back and they're like, you know what we're going to

1001
00:58:44.24 --> 00:58:50.32
say there. So the worked in stop. We had a Phil Samvags put up barbed wire, um, and then we went

1002
00:58:50.32 --> 00:58:58.40
up the side of a mountain and dug in a, um, an OP, but it was like we, we had 21 guys or a Taliban never

1003
00:58:58.40 --> 00:59:04.32
knew. We only had 20, 20, uh, one man puttune. So we had like 13 down at the cop and then we sent the

1004
00:59:04.32 --> 00:59:08.48
rest of them up on top of the hill. And we dug in. So deep that was eight foot deep pits and there

1005
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:15.36
was a living room, uh, two, 40 pit, a 50 cow pit, um, uh, like a little dying kitchen area and then

1006
00:59:15.36 --> 00:59:19.44
like three sleeping pits, like three like that two cops would fit in. Like it was huge. Did you put

1007
00:59:19.44 --> 00:59:23.76
overhead cover on them somehow? Uh, no, we just dug them deep enough where you didn't didn't. Yeah,

1008
00:59:23.76 --> 00:59:28.96
I mean, we put, I guess we put our, um, ponchos over it, you know, things like that. But not protection

1009
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:33.92
from mortars. No, no, uh, and if you stood up when they were digging it and they started digging it

1010
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:40.48
when you stood up and you were digging, they started shooting us and then we just ran hell and, um,

1011
00:59:40.48 --> 00:59:44.48
we dug in after about a month of that. We just were telling so many they just gave it up. They're like,

1012
00:59:44.48 --> 00:59:50.24
all right, we're done. Um, and that's where we, I mean, we came out, we were black on water and then

1013
00:59:50.24 --> 00:59:54.96
like the brass came out. They're like, what, you got shaving? Where's your haircut? So I'm like,

1014
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:59.52
hey, we didn't have water. Are you kidding around? Oh, bro? And then it's same-starred to me,

1015
00:59:59.52 --> 01:00:04.40
yellowed for my pants. They wanted to go up to CRLP. So my two sergeants, I, hey, sergeant

1016
01:00:04.40 --> 01:00:08.16
mills, I need you to, can you take one of your teams and just go through took four men out. And I

1017
01:00:08.16 --> 01:00:12.000
walked them right over, what I thought the road was clear, you know, but it was all filled with water

1018
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.24
when we took the place. Walk more huge ideas. They just, the batteries had died in them because they

1019
01:00:16.24 --> 01:00:19.68
waited, you know, we waited too long. But when they'd dried up, they're like, oh, there's a mortar. Oh,

1020
01:00:19.68 --> 01:00:24.80
look at that. That's a, that's a AT mine and triple stack, you know. Um, but anyways, so I was like

1021
01:00:24.80 --> 01:00:28.08
talking about on top of the OP and stuff like that. And it was funny because as they're yelling

1022
01:00:28.08 --> 01:00:32.40
this for not being shaving or cleaned up, I go a quarter of the way up. This is like a hundred

1023
01:00:32.40 --> 01:00:37.36
yards probably. Like I'm a straight up. And I go up a quarter the way with them and I say, all right,

1024
01:00:37.36 --> 01:00:41.92
I'll be right back. So I run to the top and I'd say, hey, L.T., you know, the sergeant major is coming

1025
01:00:41.92 --> 01:00:45.84
up in the kernel. So it'd just be really, you know, so we're like trying to put our uniforms on and everything

1026
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:49.44
and said like just our t-shirts. And I run back down and he's bare crawling. He said,

1027
01:00:49.44 --> 01:00:53.28
sounds like I can't do it. I don't like go with your midnight child. Needless alone. How about that?

1028
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.04
There you can.

1029
01:00:55.68 --> 01:01:01.20
Got a suit, huh? But he'd make it to the OP. He made it up to the top. He did eventually. And I'm like,

1030
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:05.04
but I came back down. I kind of put a little bit of fear in him. I said, sergeant major, this is not

1031
01:01:05.04 --> 01:01:08.64
the spot that you want to stop right there that town that's tail of handheld. Anybody in that town

1032
01:01:08.64 --> 01:01:13.60
shoots at us? And if they see that we're not moving quick, they're going to take pop shots. So you're

1033
01:01:13.60 --> 01:01:18.000
going to need to, yeah, I mean, mostly true. Yeah. He was like sitting down looking and I was like,

1034
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
no, no, no, no, you need to need to move. So I just need to go. I mean, and no, thanks to the brass.

1035
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.28
It wasn't even my sergeant major. I don't think that was there at the time. It was like a different

1036
01:01:27.68 --> 01:01:33.36
unit or whatever. But yeah, I mean, it was a wild, wild last. We were just shooting firefights every

1037
01:01:33.36 --> 01:01:37.36
day, but we were the northern limit. You know, there was no buddy farther pushing us. Pushed

1038
01:01:37.36 --> 01:01:43.52
to us. Yeah. I want one part you're talking about how you, you ended up shooting 11 javelins

1039
01:01:43.52 --> 01:01:49.20
in a day. I think. Yeah. That's that's getting a half career on pretty much anyone's standards.

1040
01:01:49.20 --> 01:01:55.52
Yeah. I think the shot 29 that hold the blame. It was just, it was cool. Damn.

1041
01:01:57.04 --> 01:02:02.88
So you conventionally want me to be fun? Yeah. You're a job. Yeah. Do the conventional army

1042
01:02:02.88 --> 01:02:08.32
were within Ramadi were freaking getting after every single day. They were awesome. Awesome.

1043
01:02:11.52 --> 01:02:16.48
Like you were getting in a firefight every day there, huh? For a bit there, we were and then

1044
01:02:16.48 --> 01:02:21.52
it died right down. They were just tired because once they shot once we just, we let loose.

1045
01:02:21.52 --> 01:02:27.12
We had enough ammo to last us for a year's probably. And we let them know. We let them know.

1046
01:02:27.12 --> 01:02:32.000
Yeah. America's real cool when it comes to ammo. Yeah. In the situation. It's like, oh,

1047
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.12
you guys need more? Yeah. We'll be right there. All right. You are,

1048
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:44.56
yeah. Same thing happened. You were like, you were like, did you find, you found triple stacked

1049
01:02:44.56 --> 01:02:50.88
IDs in your position? Yeah. So, dumbest thing. We went in and we cleared it. And then we had

1050
01:02:50.88 --> 01:02:56.40
like Marines, EOD, like Marsak, EOD, clear stuff. Like there was like unexploded RPG around the

1051
01:02:56.40 --> 01:03:00.80
side one of the walls. And then there was other booey traps. Well, turns out where we were

1052
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:05.04
rolling all of our, like, big barrels for the generator and stuff like that was like,

1053
01:03:05.04 --> 01:03:09.04
it was all booey trap. Right? Where exactly were we step? And this guy started to Barton,

1054
01:03:09.04 --> 01:03:12.72
he's a great guy. There's just met a lot of the ground. He's like, huh? What's that? It starts

1055
01:03:12.72 --> 01:03:17.52
beating on it with a shovel. And I'm going, I'm getting ready to grow on my R&R. Oh, and you got

1056
01:03:18.32 --> 01:03:22.64
tingling. What are you doing, dude? God. Something to ground here. Just looking, looking at it.

1057
01:03:22.64 --> 01:03:26.88
He starts to dig in and I was like, oh, oh, that's not, oh shit. And then turns out where you're

1058
01:03:26.88 --> 01:03:31.68
rolling these 50 gallon drums, taking all this supplies, right over top right in the breezeway.

1059
01:03:31.68 --> 01:03:37.36
Good God. It's where I would, so it was so hot there. And I mean, I get I'm rags hot too, but

1060
01:03:37.36 --> 01:03:42.56
it was so hot. Like me and my buddy, it was a one of my team leaders. We'd go out there and

1061
01:03:42.56 --> 01:03:45.60
we'd spray ourselves with water. About being our PT short spray, so the water about land

1062
01:03:45.60 --> 01:03:50.32
our cops and just see how long took the dry? Usually about 10 to 15 minutes to get completely dry.

1063
01:03:50.32 --> 01:03:56.64
And our cops were right on top of these. And no idea. Because I mean, EOD came through and they

1064
01:03:56.64 --> 01:04:01.36
didn't find it. So was he figured was like a command debt that had the battery died or something?

1065
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:07.76
Or it was a, yeah, well, it was pressure plates. Oh, my, so these big drums were having the

1066
01:04:07.76 --> 01:04:11.76
circuit connect, but the batteries and I'm died. We, you know, luckily we didn't take the

1067
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:16.64
property to, you know, I'd like to, I think after the march, that guy's got it. They went in there

1068
01:04:16.64 --> 01:04:20.64
and Boobey trapped it all knowing that we were trying to take it, but somehow the batteries didn't

1069
01:04:20.64 --> 01:04:25.76
work, which helped out for us, because we jumped over a rock wall that they had, where there was

1070
01:04:25.76 --> 01:04:30.80
like a hole in the wall, ready from probably a hellfire, so from time of four. So right where we,

1071
01:04:30.80 --> 01:04:33.60
you know, obviously, be East Place President Trump over, that's what we all jumped over and there was

1072
01:04:33.60 --> 01:04:41.12
stuff stacked there too. So it's where you talk about it in here. And I heard this from the Vietnam

1073
01:04:41.12 --> 01:04:48.08
seals. They would set up ambushes on VC and they would, you know, go, okay, we're going to shoot

1074
01:04:48.08 --> 01:04:51.36
from here and when we shoot from here, they're going to take cover over here behind this lock,

1075
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:56.72
so they'd put a big claim or underneath that lock. And you're talking about how the Taliban is doing

1076
01:04:56.72 --> 01:05:01.12
the same thing over there, you know, basically, oh, as soon as we start shooting,

1077
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:04.88
now I'm going to run to these cover positions. So we'll just put Boobey traps in mines and any

1078
01:05:04.88 --> 01:05:09.28
of these cover positions. Yeah, we actually had to change up our SOPs or standing out praying

1079
01:05:09.28 --> 01:05:12.88
procedures on my third deployment instead of diving for cover, you've had to take a knee.

1080
01:05:12.88 --> 01:05:16.64
Yeah, that's what I was reading and I was just, that's what reminded me of. I reminded me

1081
01:05:16.64 --> 01:05:22.32
of that's what my predecessors and the seal teams and Vietnam would do to the enemy. And now

1082
01:05:23.12 --> 01:05:29.68
the enemy was doing it to us or to you guys. Yeah, scary. This is this is an interesting spot.

1083
01:05:29.68 --> 01:05:34.000
You're heading home from leave from there. I left in May and caught a series of connecting

1084
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.72
flights home to America. I gave Kelsey a huge kiss at the airport and Dallas when I got back

1085
01:05:38.72 --> 01:05:44.16
to the house gave her dog buddy a big hug. It felt great to be back, but it also felt surreal.

1086
01:05:44.16 --> 01:05:48.80
And this is a strange part of this leave time. I didn't quite know what to do with myself.

1087
01:05:49.36 --> 01:05:53.84
I could take a hot shower anytime I wanted. I could sit on the couch and play video games.

1088
01:05:53.84 --> 01:05:57.28
I could drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger outside on the back porch.

1089
01:05:57.92 --> 01:06:03.76
Nobody was shooting at me. Nobody's stunk. Nobody was sleeping on triple stacked IEDs.

1090
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:09.36
Kelsey was finishing up the semester with college and work, so I bought a truck and we drove

1091
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:13.44
up to Michigan to see my parents. We had a few bright and happy days with them,

1092
01:06:13.44 --> 01:06:19.20
then it was soon time to go just like that. I hugged my parents, gave Kelsey a big kiss,

1093
01:06:19.20 --> 01:06:25.52
and flew out to Detroit to head back overseas. It felt oddly good to be back to Afghanistan.

1094
01:06:26.08 --> 01:06:30.80
The feeling is difficult to explain. In America, when I'd hung around with some friends and

1095
01:06:30.80 --> 01:06:34.56
Dallas and got re-acquainted with some of my buddies from high school back in Michigan,

1096
01:06:34.56 --> 01:06:41.60
I'd seen first-hand, how most of the people my age lived. If a dude was 22 or 23 like me,

1097
01:06:41.60 --> 01:06:46.80
he was usually finishing up college or hanging out trying to find an internship or an entry-level job.

1098
01:06:47.20 --> 01:06:51.84
He might be living in his parents' basement, trying to scrape together enough money to move out.

1099
01:06:52.48 --> 01:06:56.16
Or maybe he was partying hard on weekends or maybe still in a frat.

1100
01:06:57.28 --> 01:07:02.32
He was almost always short on money. Almost always wondering what to do with his future.

1101
01:07:03.12 --> 01:07:06.80
Not that there was anything wrong with any of that. A guy's got to do what a guy's got to do,

1102
01:07:06.80 --> 01:07:13.44
but by contrast, at my age in the military, I led people in combat. I controlled firefights.

1103
01:07:13.44 --> 01:07:18.32
I handled hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment. I made decisions that affected

1104
01:07:18.32 --> 01:07:25.20
whether people would live or die. It felt real. On a personal level, I made decent money. I was

1105
01:07:25.20 --> 01:07:30.72
married. I had a good credit score. I was thinking of buying a house soon. It felt good to be

1106
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:37.68
trusted with this much responsibility. I was proud of my drive and sense of accomplishment. I was already

1107
01:07:37.68 --> 01:07:47.52
a man. I think statements like that are like what get kids or if I say kids, but like when I meet

1108
01:07:47.52 --> 01:07:52.32
kids, like I've just met at this event, we were just at, and this, you know, he's like, I'm 19.

1109
01:07:52.32 --> 01:07:56.64
I just joined the Marine Corps. I'm leaving September 18th. And that statement like that

1110
01:07:56.64 --> 01:08:01.20
is what I think makes people join the military. It gets a lot of people to join the military.

1111
01:08:01.20 --> 01:08:07.44
Like 22 years old. Oh, yeah. You get paid. You've got a steady job. Your job is more meaningful

1112
01:08:07.44 --> 01:08:12.32
than any job they could have. I mean, never mind, maybe they're working at fast food, right?

1113
01:08:12.32 --> 01:08:17.36
Like I did. You know, never mind that they're working at Wendy's. Even if they have a kick-ass

1114
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:20.56
job somewhere, it doesn't matter. Your job is more meaningful because you're a soldier fighting

1115
01:08:20.56 --> 01:08:24.72
for freedom. Yeah, and they would, you know, you go back home and you see what they're doing.

1116
01:08:24.72 --> 01:08:30.80
You're like, wow, my lots of change. And I'm like, I've been Afghanistan. I got married. I have an

1117
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:36.72
apartment. I, you know, I have two cars, whatever. And it's at that young stage. I mean, in my friends

1118
01:08:36.72 --> 01:08:40.40
back home, they were still really nice and, you know, I still get along with them and everything.

1119
01:08:40.40 --> 01:08:45.20
I just felt like what I was doing was was a different purpose. And I was trusted with more

1120
01:08:45.20 --> 01:08:47.68
things. I mean, when you're in college and everybody's like, oh, you're a kid in college,

1121
01:08:47.68 --> 01:08:50.96
but when you're in the army and you're like, oh, you're in the army, you're on your second

1122
01:08:50.96 --> 01:08:57.60
appointment. You know, what do you do? And charge of seven other lives, include it as well as my own.

1123
01:08:57.60 --> 01:09:01.20
And I tell them where to move, what to do, how to shoot, and how to how to do things. And they're like,

1124
01:09:01.76 --> 01:09:07.20
oh, okay. Yeah, I'll get some kid in the gym. In my gym, we'll be like, oh, yeah, well, you know,

1125
01:09:07.20 --> 01:09:11.52
while we'll meet 23, you know, oh, yeah, when I was a 23, I was in my third seal, but dude,

1126
01:09:12.80 --> 01:09:18.000
kill me. Actually, we were drinking beers because there was nothing going on. But anyway,

1127
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.04
kill him. But one year, kill him. But one year, like a beast. So then, how did you feel about that

1128
01:09:25.04 --> 01:09:28.88
two weeks leave during the middle deployment? Well, I mean, it's a constant worry. Like, how are my

1129
01:09:28.88 --> 01:09:33.12
guys doing? We had a satellite phone. We didn't have internet or things like that. So I couldn't just

1130
01:09:33.12 --> 01:09:39.92
like, hit him up real quick on a, because the army makes you do that. Well, yeah, they allow it.

1131
01:09:39.92 --> 01:09:43.28
And then they, they say you need, you know, this stuff. And but they're pretty aren't they don't they push

1132
01:09:43.28 --> 01:09:49.04
it pretty hard? No. I mean, I mean, I was stuck with the question hard. Well, that's, and I,

1133
01:09:49.04 --> 01:09:53.04
and I don't, just, just, just, don't discriminate. I don't know how to say this politically correct.

1134
01:09:53.04 --> 01:09:59.12
There's, there's the army that's at Boggermar for space that wears PT belts that, you know,

1135
01:09:59.12 --> 01:10:03.92
goes to Dunkin, goes to get their Dunkin down and that complaints because not a lot takes too

1136
01:10:03.92 --> 01:10:08.64
hot. And then there's the people like us where it's like, there's 22 of us or 21 of us

1137
01:10:08.64 --> 01:10:12.72
sitting out in Millenau where taking no showers. No one's going to come say, hey, you need to do this.

1138
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:16.80
We had one kid come out now ran into him again in Lansing, Michigan actually had an event. He,

1139
01:10:16.80 --> 01:10:21.04
you know, out of the military and I didn't realize it was him. But he came out. He chose to be a financial

1140
01:10:22.08 --> 01:10:25.76
guy. And this says in the financial world, and that's fine. Hey, you want to do finance,

1141
01:10:25.76 --> 01:10:30.08
you want to work in the S4 shop? Great. It comes out. They're given a survey. Some dumps survey that

1142
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:34.08
they're just, whatever, big army wants. You know, the good idea fairies and whatever. But

1143
01:10:34.48 --> 01:10:37.36
he's on the rooftop. He's like, oh, man, hope we're getting a gunfight. It's going to be great.

1144
01:10:38.16 --> 01:10:41.92
And look, all of a sudden, excuse me. He's like, well, no, I just, you know, because I, I'm on the

1145
01:10:41.92 --> 01:10:46.08
five all the time, I just, I mean, I love, I want to see a gun, you know, I hope we're getting a firefight.

1146
01:10:46.72 --> 01:10:50.80
I said, what, don't you get if they shoot it us, my guys could get hit for what your

1147
01:10:50.80 --> 01:10:55.52
hoping happens here. I said, I got an idea, get off my roof. And he's like, well, I said, no,

1148
01:10:55.52 --> 01:10:59.84
seriously, get, I'm going to throw you off this roof. You don't get off it. And he looked at,

1149
01:10:59.84 --> 01:11:03.28
I critter, one of my, one of my guys and critter goes, oh, no, Sergeant Mills is real.

1150
01:11:03.28 --> 01:11:08.56
I'll throw you off this roof. And I said, if we get shot at, don't get in my guys way. Stay the

1151
01:11:08.56 --> 01:11:13.84
fuck off the roof and get down. Yeah. And he was just like, but I don't get it. I'm like, it's not a game.

1152
01:11:13.84 --> 01:11:18.16
This isn't, I mean, when we get a firefight, you know, we get, you know, people run up on their

1153
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:22.24
PT shorts and their flip flops and they got their Kevlar on their body on her, but, I mean,

1154
01:11:22.24 --> 01:11:25.92
that's real life, bullets are flying. In the way he was just so nonsular, I hope we get a firefight.

1155
01:11:25.92 --> 01:11:30.08
That would be really cool. It's like, my guys could get shot. Like, what part of the cool don't you get?

1156
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:35.52
So, I mean, they're, you know, the army does push something to other times. We're just left alone.

1157
01:11:35.52 --> 01:11:40.96
Yeah, I just remember guys going from, from guys that were in combat all the time, not

1158
01:11:40.96 --> 01:11:46.24
fobits, but, and they, it seemed like the command, their commands wanted to go home for those two

1159
01:11:46.24 --> 01:11:49.92
weeks and hey, man, you need to take this break on your feet. Oh, the feet mandatory. Yeah, I think

1160
01:11:49.92 --> 01:11:53.68
you meant like Colin home. Colin home, stuff, not man. Oh, no, I just meant going home, sorry.

1161
01:11:53.68 --> 01:11:56.48
Yeah, yeah, you have to go home. You have to go. Okay, that's what I thought. And a lot of

1162
01:11:56.48 --> 01:12:00.64
guys, some guys don't want to, but you have to. You know, the Colin home thing, I think is,

1163
01:12:00.64 --> 01:12:05.28
is, I don't know how often you call to home, but I try to call them like once a week. Once or

1164
01:12:05.28 --> 01:12:08.96
twice a week. Because if you start doing more than that, I think it's worse on both of you. Well,

1165
01:12:08.96 --> 01:12:13.12
you ran out of things to say. Oh, it's cool. You know, I mean, no offense to anybody's love life

1166
01:12:13.12 --> 01:12:17.44
out there, but in my life, I'm out getting along great, you know, but when I would call home,

1167
01:12:17.44 --> 01:12:19.92
hey, we're doing, well, just no day and I have to answer and I don't want to be like, well,

1168
01:12:19.92 --> 01:12:23.92
it's out and I got shot at and then I ended up killing two people and then this guy got hurt,

1169
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:27.52
but it's okay. He's going to be fine. You don't want to be afraid. You know, she can't say

1170
01:12:27.52 --> 01:12:30.40
guys up like, well, well, you know, I went on patrol the day, got to help with help with

1171
01:12:30.40 --> 01:12:35.12
kid tie a shoe, you know, and like that gets old and then what'd you do? Well, I went to school today and

1172
01:12:35.12 --> 01:12:38.40
I mean, there's no real story there, right? So I got to let it build for a week or two.

1173
01:12:38.40 --> 01:12:45.44
I definitely recommend that. I mean, that the nicest way. No, I know, totally. And I think if you're

1174
01:12:45.44 --> 01:12:50.08
if you're calling home every day, then you're like, you're you're missing and you're connecting

1175
01:12:50.08 --> 01:12:53.60
and just like, no, like you said, let it build, have something to talk about real,

1176
01:12:54.24 --> 01:12:56.96
and what does that get to know? And like, what are you thinking about? And then you get a

1177
01:12:56.96 --> 01:13:02.24
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.

1178
01:13:02.24 --> 01:13:06.08
You know, I see it happened. You know, I even say I happen to mean Kelsey. You know, like, what are you thinking about? Well, no. What do you think? What do you want to talk about?

1179
01:13:06.08 --> 01:13:13.60
Well, no, oh, you got nothing to talk to me about. It's like, no, I don't. And it's not a bad thing. It's not that I love you any less. It's that literally I can't tell you what happened here.

1180
01:13:13.60 --> 01:13:22.48
Because it's not going to make you feel better about the situation. And so, and you know another thing is, you know, you got all this stuff going on,

1181
01:13:22.48 --> 01:13:27.04
and then your wife's like, you won't believe this and you're like, what? And she's like, um,

1182
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:32.96
we lost that library book that we got out. And now they called and they want us to pay for it. You're like,

1183
01:13:33.76 --> 01:13:39.60
just got the check. Let's get in the check. We're going to be good. Well, they overcharge it. I'm going to do your research.

1184
01:13:40.56 --> 01:13:47.68
You find it online, you know, cheaper. Yeah, yeah, some of the big, the big, the big, the big

1185
01:13:47.68 --> 01:13:54.08
drama, drama at home. You know, the wide eye, like, oh, no, it's like, that's not okay. Well, I watched the guy

1186
01:13:54.08 --> 01:13:59.68
bleeding, bleeding out to the head. Yeah, that's my finger in the bullet holes. So I get what you're saying. Same thing. I was like,

1187
01:13:59.68 --> 01:14:05.52
well, my God, I mean, believe this. But you go ahead. Tell me what happened with you. Tell me about the

1188
01:14:05.52 --> 01:14:12.16
spoiled by mayonnaise that you had on your sandwich. Um, that's not joke. That's awful. You get home from that

1189
01:14:12.16 --> 01:14:17.44
deployment. Going back to the book. My parents threw down from Michigan, Josh and Dina. This is your

1190
01:14:17.44 --> 01:14:23.20
Josh, as your brother-in-law, Dina's his wife. We're there. And some of the guys from my unit came over.

1191
01:14:23.92 --> 01:14:28.88
I manned the barbecue, the smell of charcoal fired. Hamburger's drifted over the neighborhood. And I

1192
01:14:28.88 --> 01:14:36.40
felt like the luckiest man alive. Kelsey and I had a dog, two cars and now a house. We were young

1193
01:14:36.40 --> 01:14:40.08
family living the American dream. So you had the gold vine house and now you actually bought one, right?

1194
01:14:40.08 --> 01:14:43.20
Far of attorney. I called my wife and she's like, guess what I did today? I was like, what? She

1195
01:14:43.20 --> 01:14:46.08
was like, what? She goes, I bought a house. And like, how did you do that? She's like, well, you bought it.

1196
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:49.92
It sounded like a piece of paper. Far of attorney. So speaking of jokes, I tell her time I

1197
01:14:49.92 --> 01:14:54.32
thought, there we go. But, uh, now we bought a house and then my brother-in-law, he was, they had a

1198
01:14:54.32 --> 01:15:00.40
young young child. They still do Reagan. But, over the time, she was like, seven, eight months old, I guess.

1199
01:15:00.40 --> 01:15:04.96
And I was like, you drink in that Josh because I have responsibilities. You know, like, oh, I'm

1200
01:15:04.96 --> 01:15:08.64
all holding her in that or something like I can't drink. And then by the end of the night, he passed

1201
01:15:08.64 --> 01:15:17.92
down the fire. Junkers could be smoked to pack a sick. He's like, oh, that hurts so bad.

1202
01:15:19.28 --> 01:15:27.20
And then I was like, responsibility. Famous last words. Back to the book, fortunately after

1203
01:15:27.20 --> 01:15:32.16
I got home, I didn't struggle with any past memories of combat. Although I do, I know any number of soldiers

1204
01:15:32.16 --> 01:15:38.96
who do. I told a few stories to Kelsey about our unit's time in Robatt and BMG about going without a

1205
01:15:38.96 --> 01:15:44.16
shower for so long and about some fire fights, we got into an impalent, corvette. But she didn't

1206
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:50.24
like to talk about those things much. And I understood that. I found I could shut off the memories

1207
01:15:50.24 --> 01:15:57.20
pretty easily. My logic was straightforward. I was a combat soldier. That's what I did. I told my mind

1208
01:15:57.20 --> 01:16:02.08
to go to certain places and I refused to allow to go to other places. I found that I could connect

1209
01:16:02.08 --> 01:16:08.32
with my family best that way. Although I know other guys handle things differently with equal success.

1210
01:16:10.40 --> 01:16:14.24
And the reason I threw that in there is just because, you know, I get a lot of guys that asked me

1211
01:16:14.24 --> 01:16:20.08
about how to handle the whatever memories they're bringing home. And I thought that was a pretty

1212
01:16:20.08 --> 01:16:23.60
good methodology, man. Like, no, okay, I'm not going to think about that right now. Yeah, I mean,

1213
01:16:23.60 --> 01:16:27.92
it was like I had a barrier. You're just so desensitized when you're over there. Like,

1214
01:16:27.92 --> 01:16:32.000
I'm pretty sure the book talks about it. But we went on patrol and then one of the A&A guys

1215
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.48
or A&P was wearing a bright green, you know, like a construction vest. And now we're all

1216
01:16:38.48 --> 01:16:42.88
in getting ready to load up in the trucks and someone made the joke I think it was me or maybe

1217
01:16:42.88 --> 01:16:45.92
creator. But either way, we were like, well, that guy's going to get shot today because he stood out.

1218
01:16:46.64 --> 01:16:49.44
He ended up being the only guy that was shot that day and he ended up dying, you know, eventually

1219
01:16:49.44 --> 01:16:53.68
from his wounds. But he said, oh, well, he got, yep, that guy died. But you're just, you know,

1220
01:16:53.68 --> 01:16:58.16
say it like, hoping to get shot, but you're just like, well, that's part of what happens. But she

1221
01:16:58.16 --> 01:17:01.44
didn't like hearing my stories of the combat and things like that. So I was just like, well, I guess I won't

1222
01:17:01.44 --> 01:17:04.72
talk about them. She's like, you just get so excited about telling those stories and you laugh about it.

1223
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:10.48
And it's real serious. I'm like, well, I made it. Like, you know, yeah, but you still snap an action.

1224
01:17:10.48 --> 01:17:15.76
I was driving to my house with my buddy. And we went past the firing range and they opened up

1225
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:21.36
the 240s and like, I hit the brakes contact right contact right at pull over and me and him.

1226
01:17:21.36 --> 01:17:26.32
I both reaching for our M4s, which was supposed to be next to us. We're like, oh, oh, yeah,

1227
01:17:26.32 --> 01:17:34.96
I made a mini van. It was a Chevy in Paul. For me, wasn't mini van. I have a mini van. I love it.

1228
01:17:36.24 --> 01:17:41.20
Oh, speaking of many vans, you found out you're, you're going to be a daddy at this point, too,

1229
01:17:41.20 --> 01:17:44.40
when you came home from your second appointment. Oh, no, that'd be awful. If I came from second

1230
01:17:44.40 --> 01:17:48.96
appointment, I found something to be a dad. It took us a little while. Oh, well, four months after I got back,

1231
01:17:48.96 --> 01:17:54.32
we're going to, yeah, right off. Yeah, that case, a few of the ones I wasn't trying to apply anything.

1232
01:17:54.32 --> 01:18:00.16
I don't know. Yeah, but we, yeah, so I didn't plan on it right away, you know, I haven't

1233
01:18:00.16 --> 01:18:05.60
children, but find out we're going to have children or have a daughter and work down great, you know,

1234
01:18:05.60 --> 01:18:10.64
I'm very excited. Did the whole nesting thing? My wife had a sweet Mazda 3 hatchback. What's the

1235
01:18:10.64 --> 01:18:14.64
whole nesting thing? You know, like set the baby room up. You never really, I could tell my wife

1236
01:18:14.64 --> 01:18:19.84
because I bought her in a brand new car in 2010. I was brand new offline Mazda 3 hatchback. She loves it.

1237
01:18:19.84 --> 01:18:23.76
I loved it. I was like, that baby's he's not going to fit in that car. She's like, yeah, it's going to be fine.

1238
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:28.88
I'm like, no, it's not. Finding a so mad one day, like after arguing with her about it, I went

1239
01:18:28.88 --> 01:18:32.24
out there and I popped the car seat in. And I said, go ahead and jump in your, Jared, obviously, honey,

1240
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:36.000
go ahead and jump in there and she couldn't fit. She's like, oh, just jump right off at 10. She was so mad.

1241
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:44.08
I loved everything. You know, because then I won. I won that game. You were right. That feels good.

1242
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:49.84
I got you off topic. So yeah, we were going to have a kid. I'm straight on top of away.

1243
01:18:49.84 --> 01:18:54.08
Tight on top of over here. I know you're professional. I didn't doubt that.

1244
01:18:55.92 --> 01:19:02.88
September 27, 2011, their daughter was born. Wow. I made some weird noises in the back of my throat.

1245
01:19:02.88 --> 01:19:09.20
So there our kid was with goo all over her and she was wrinkly and scrunched up and all I could

1246
01:19:09.20 --> 01:19:16.08
think of that she was the most beautiful thing in the world. It's so great to cry. The nurse said,

1247
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:21.68
I did not cry. So I just kept making weird noises in my throat.

1248
01:19:21.68 --> 01:19:26.48
I was like, the nurse is like, it's okay. It's okay to cry, Mr. Meals. I'm like,

1249
01:19:26.48 --> 01:19:34.32
I'm crying. Now I'm like, oh, that was weird in this case. Like, this guy's taking his kid home.

1250
01:19:34.32 --> 01:19:37.76
I mean, I almost fought the pediatrician that day. Oh man. I wanted to get there.

1251
01:19:37.76 --> 01:19:41.44
I was talking about Belgium beer, some damn thing. And like, I hear the two doctors talk and my kids

1252
01:19:41.44 --> 01:19:45.20
and they're crying and the nurse comes out saying, hey, who's supposed to be looking at my kid? And they're like,

1253
01:19:45.20 --> 01:19:49.92
oh, doctor, this, you have the baby and their, I don't have one in there. And she was, you must have a guy goes,

1254
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:56.24
oh, I'm supposed to forgot how on chuckles it off and then goes it back, talk and I told the nurse to get that kid back in that room. And I turned around that guy.

1255
01:19:56.24 --> 01:20:02.40
And I'm already up like, you know, 18, 20 hours because we went to labor and do whatever and eyes of bloodshot. And I'm just like,

1256
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:06.72
still jack from looking at the weights and I'm like, you know, you're not going to look at my kid.

1257
01:20:06.72 --> 01:20:12.48
If I'm yet better pediatrician, the guy's like, and I had to go get Kelsey's thumb and the came in. She was, they were very nice when they got in.

1258
01:20:12.48 --> 01:20:18.16
I was like, I don't know why. You know, Tower and Orva's guy, like, I will beat you if you touch my kid.

1259
01:20:18.16 --> 01:20:25.52
You're not doing her job, bro. Now we put her in the car seat, take her home and we get home and I'm other than

1260
01:20:25.52 --> 01:20:30.32
those with us and we're looking at Kelsey goes to your car. She was, why should you not buckled? As a team,

1261
01:20:30.32 --> 01:20:35.12
I thought you did. She was Travis, I thought you did it. No. Strike, you know, you're on. Good,

1262
01:20:35.12 --> 01:20:38.72
good data ward, no one coming out of the gates coming out of the gate, strong.

1263
01:20:38.72 --> 01:20:43.20
I think they'll fortify me in a drive, no car. There are no buckled cars. I'm a good driver.

1264
01:20:43.20 --> 01:20:47.92
Yeah, that's good. Luckily. And meanwhile this time you're still a soldier, you go to,

1265
01:20:47.92 --> 01:20:54.000
you go to a jump master school and you failed jump master school the first time. I did.

1266
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.52
Yeah. And in the sad part, it wasn't like the J&PI. There you go.

1267
01:20:57.52 --> 01:20:59.84
Let's jump. I'm a part of the J&PI. The written exam.

1268
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:06.32
Yeah. That reading. That's fun. No, you know what? That academic part of jump master school.

1269
01:21:06.32 --> 01:21:11.20
I've heard that's the most brutal part. It was rough. It was rough. And I failed. I failed that.

1270
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:16.000
And I was like, oh, you must be a dumbass, you know, I'm like, I am. But I went back

1271
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.64
to the next, you know, the next cycle. I did a better thing. Through. You know, I thought it was cool

1272
01:21:20.64 --> 01:21:27.84
in here. You talked about, you know, one kid you threw out the plane. Yeah. I give another kid you

1273
01:21:27.84 --> 01:21:31.76
kicked out the plane. Never find. Yeah. And that's the thing. They came and thank you later.

1274
01:21:31.76 --> 01:21:34.64
Because they're just like scared, right? I'm not sure if they made it on. I don't know.

1275
01:21:34.64 --> 01:21:40.72
Yeah. Well, it no. Look that you made up here. Yeah. You claimed.

1276
01:21:40.72 --> 01:21:45.76
That's most fabricated. Look. No. Yeah. So I give my brief. And I always made the youngest

1277
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:51.04
or the, like the least senior guy I give the brief. So like you tell him the brief if, you know,

1278
01:21:51.04 --> 01:21:54.72
I say green light go and you don't go, give it to the or two more times. If you don't jump,

1279
01:21:54.72 --> 01:21:58.48
I will unhook you. Attach you, give it off or it'll touch your equipment. So, you know, say go to

1280
01:21:58.48 --> 01:22:01.28
the real pair trip or whatever. That's what I know jumpers. That one is called.

1281
01:22:01.28 --> 01:22:05.20
Uh, they have a name for it. Yeah. Jump refusal. Jump refusal. Yeah. So yeah.

1282
01:22:05.20 --> 01:22:09.52
Could then that be a territory. Oh, yeah. And then as I say my brief, you're, you know, this is all three

1283
01:22:09.52 --> 01:22:13.12
pages you got to memorize. I'd stop my brief right there and say, but I guarantee you today

1284
01:22:13.12 --> 01:22:18.56
if you're on my door, you are going. So I told the guy, you know, green light go and like the first

1285
01:22:18.56 --> 01:22:22.48
guy went. The second guy went third guy went fourth guy or whatever. That'll go and then finally

1286
01:22:22.48 --> 01:22:27.68
get to like 13 or 14. That's what's the exit all, you know, 30 pair tripers or 32, whatever.

1287
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:32.32
And this guy's like frozen. I'm like, I know you, uh, think you're not going to go, but you

1288
01:22:32.32 --> 01:22:36.40
better jump out of this plane and you're like, you know, and I said, I told you you were going and

1289
01:22:36.40 --> 01:22:40.16
then back with shirt back with pants. I just threw them out and then the person behind

1290
01:22:40.16 --> 01:22:45.52
was like, I'm like, get going. And then another jump, the same thing happened. I said, I told you

1291
01:22:45.52 --> 01:22:50.24
you were going. He's, they're frozen the door. Like one foot back. I just grabbed the top. Oh,

1292
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:53.28
sorry, back that grab the top of the plane. I just kicked right in the back of his pair. She

1293
01:22:53.28 --> 01:22:58.72
out of the door. We went. I was like, we'd hear those rumors, but I never saw it happen.

1294
01:22:58.72 --> 01:23:01.84
Yeah. I mean, if they don't jump, they're going to lose money. And then they're going to waste a

1295
01:23:01.84 --> 01:23:05.44
good pass. And then the plane either can go back around, make another pass and like prolong

1296
01:23:05.44 --> 01:23:09.76
everybody's night and make it harder because I have a person I got to paperwork on now,

1297
01:23:09.76 --> 01:23:14.32
because I don't like to do. Or you can barely write. Yeah, what I understand. So what? No

1298
01:23:14.32 --> 01:23:18.96
right hand. So he's be a hand-it. So my ex-back. But that's cool. Take, take folks and me

1299
01:23:18.96 --> 01:23:25.68
with a lot of like, um, but yeah, I mean, so it was just fear got the best of them. And I was just like,

1300
01:23:25.68 --> 01:23:29.28
no, we're going today. And you're, you know, I said some other choice words in there here, but they

1301
01:23:29.28 --> 01:23:34.80
went. But what I liked about that from like a broader perspective than just airborne school is

1302
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:39.12
like so often, man, people just need to like go. Because like like you said, once you go and you

1303
01:23:39.12 --> 01:23:43.28
get that first thing under your belt, then they go and they jump. It's no problem. You know, but so often

1304
01:23:43.28 --> 01:23:47.44
people are, they just, they're just scared of the unknown, you know? And what you got to do is just go,

1305
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:52.72
just jump. Well, my fit jump in everyone's school, that can I, you know, peevey two meals.

1306
01:23:52.72 --> 01:23:56.48
I jumped out and it was nighttime combat. I was so scared. I didn't know what to do. But I was like,

1307
01:23:56.48 --> 01:24:00.40
well, I'm not going to be the big sister on this airplane, you know. So I drove out like suitman.

1308
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:07.12
And I got my lift, leg caught up in the risers. I was coming down like a, like a flamingo and my

1309
01:24:07.12 --> 01:24:11.68
shoot started to collapse on me. And I was shaking my, I was falling fast. But I had pull my reserve.

1310
01:24:11.68 --> 01:24:16.32
You pulled your reserve at everyone's school. Yeah. No kid. They were mad about that. Oh, yeah.

1311
01:24:16.32 --> 01:24:20.56
But I was dropping fast and I guess you survived, which is a good thing. Yeah. Yeah. But my,

1312
01:24:20.56 --> 01:24:24.000
my leg was tangled up so bad. It's in the first jump in the vision. I'm like, oh,

1313
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.56
I don't know if I want to do it anymore. And then the guy in front of me went and I was like,

1314
01:24:26.56 --> 01:24:33.20
well, okay, he did it. That's, yeah, that's not good to have a, uh, have to pull your reserve

1315
01:24:33.20 --> 01:24:37.44
at an airborne school. But I mean, it wasn't because of malfunctioning because my own stupidity.

1316
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I dove out like suitman, my left leg got caught up in there and I couldn't shake it out. And then I was

1317
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.36
like watching the silver wets above me, they're like, pull your reserve bells and they're like, okay.

1318
01:24:45.36 --> 01:24:55.12
Take up E6. So now you're, now your staff sergeant take over a weapon squad.

1319
01:24:56.64 --> 01:25:03.20
Which is the senior spot. But I was, I went to work that day. I got picked, finished AL, ALC, or whatever.

1320
01:25:04.80 --> 01:25:09.04
Which is a E6 course. I went my first turn. So I have offers and, you know, second and first brigade.

1321
01:25:09.60 --> 01:25:14.08
Five away. I'm, I'm going to take those about have a squad leader spot, you know, I get back from

1322
01:25:14.08 --> 01:25:18.72
this four day vacation or four day break. I came back and gave him the senior spot. Here you go.

1323
01:25:18.72 --> 01:25:26.64
Yes. Oh, yes. And Kelsey, she didn't really want you to go overseas again to Chey.

1324
01:25:27.20 --> 01:25:31.84
I mean, yes and no, she understood it. But I mean, obviously no wife wants to, they're

1325
01:25:31.84 --> 01:25:35.28
love when to go overseas or there hasn't been to go overseas or whatever. We just bought a house,

1326
01:25:35.28 --> 01:25:39.28
the baby was just born quite frankly, we could use, we could use the tax pretty money.

1327
01:25:39.28 --> 01:25:44.64
100% could use that money that you get from being over there and also we have the soldiers coming

1328
01:25:44.64 --> 01:25:48.24
to my house and have barbecues and Chey-C's, how they look up to me and how I'm in charge of them.

1329
01:25:48.24 --> 01:25:53.04
And it's this old camaraderie and brotherhood thing. I had orders to forthood. I had my sergeant major

1330
01:25:53.04 --> 01:25:57.04
cancel on. I was like, I don't know why you're kicking me out. I go, I'm not kicking you out. I said,

1331
01:25:57.04 --> 01:26:00.48
sergeant major, I have orders to forthood and he's like, you, not want to go. I said, no, I need to

1332
01:26:00.48 --> 01:26:05.20
deploy these guys. So he's just like, I'll take care of it. The way you put in the book is the

1333
01:26:05.20 --> 01:26:10.64
reason I went overseas was because of the soldier next to me. The guys in my squad are jobless to

1334
01:26:10.64 --> 01:26:16.64
protect American, keep the Taliban at bay. I'd train my men. I taught them all I knew. It was my

1335
01:26:16.64 --> 01:26:20.32
job to take care of them. I couldn't imagine them deploying without me.

1336
01:26:23.44 --> 01:26:27.92
And I mean, I was quite frankly upset. I got those orders. But they were building a new brigade.

1337
01:26:27.92 --> 01:26:32.56
And they wanted combat NCOs with over two years of combat experience to go help, you know,

1338
01:26:32.56 --> 01:26:37.60
lead these guys. And I was like, a noble, I get it. But not not for me right now.

1339
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.96
You're leaving. And Josh is going away at the same time. Your brother and all your wife's brother

1340
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:53.20
going away. Same time. Here we go. Back to the book. She was in tears. A beautiful mess.

1341
01:26:53.20 --> 01:26:59.12
Josh was leaving on that same deployment too. But a day later than I was. So he came to see me off

1342
01:26:59.12 --> 01:27:04.72
in support of sister. I hugged him and he hugged me back. Chloe was five months old and sleeping

1343
01:27:04.72 --> 01:27:10.08
sounding her car seat. She never woke up when I kissed her cheek. I unstrap my daughter,

1344
01:27:10.08 --> 01:27:14.88
picked her up and cradled her tightly one last time in my arms. She inhaled deeply smiled

1345
01:27:15.76 --> 01:27:22.000
and carried on sleeping. Then I waved goodbye. Walking away from my loved ones, I had to ask myself

1346
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.20
if this third deployment felt different from the first two. I had a child to think about now.

1347
01:27:27.20 --> 01:27:34.40
A family. I knew there would be 10 days in fire fights ahead. But honestly, I wasn't afraid of dying.

1348
01:27:35.76 --> 01:27:39.44
I wouldn't be reckless and make myself an easy target and I didn't want to die.

1349
01:27:40.32 --> 01:27:46.08
But I knew that if I got hit, then I got hit. If it happened, then it was meant to be.

1350
01:27:47.76 --> 01:27:53.44
As a soldier, it's not like I talk about my emotions every day. I don't write poetry. I don't

1351
01:27:53.44 --> 01:28:00.08
watch romantic comedies as a rule. I'm trained to kill people. That's what I do. You've got to be

1352
01:28:00.08 --> 01:28:07.84
tough in the 80s. Second, you've got to be as hard as life. You don't want to show weakness ever,

1353
01:28:07.84 --> 01:28:12.80
particularly with any of your guys around. When you're overseas and out in the middle of nowhere

1354
01:28:12.80 --> 01:28:19.04
and you have 12 to 20 guys with you, you can't take a seat and say you're done. As a leader,

1355
01:28:19.04 --> 01:28:25.44
I couldn't throw my helmet down and complain that things weren't fair. You have to make the best of it.

1356
01:28:25.44 --> 01:28:33.76
You have to keep going. You've got to be as tough as they come. But even so, as I walked away from

1357
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:41.04
my wife and child and brother-in-law, the wind struck my eye and I wiped away the wetness with the

1358
01:28:41.04 --> 01:28:50.64
back of my sleeve. Harder going away on this deployment? No, a little bit. It didn't feel right.

1359
01:28:51.44 --> 01:28:54.72
I actually had a conversation with my brother-in-law and his garage with him.

1360
01:28:54.72 --> 01:28:58.08
I was like, you know, Josh, it's always a guy that you don't expect to get hit. That gets hit.

1361
01:28:58.08 --> 01:29:02.32
We didn't start naming out the people from our deployments because we were the same brigade always,

1362
01:29:02.32 --> 01:29:06.72
just different unions. And I said, I just don't feel good about it. I mean, nothing I couldn't

1363
01:29:06.72 --> 01:29:10.48
go where I wasn't going to go. But yeah, it was harder. You know, my wife and everything. I was

1364
01:29:10.48 --> 01:29:13.68
supposed to leave the next day. I went to work and I like, hey, look, we need to take this

1365
01:29:13.68 --> 01:29:19.28
truck at guys over. Can you leave tonight instead of tomorrow night? And I was like, well,

1366
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:23.36
yeah, I got to leave work right now. And I was going to see my wife and my kid and I like, yeah,

1367
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:30.40
you can go. So I went. But it does, you know, I wouldn't say each deployment's harder. The second one

1368
01:29:30.40 --> 01:29:35.20
wasn't hard for me to go. I mean, I had to take a bite, but part of my job, the third one was more

1369
01:29:35.20 --> 01:29:40.40
man, I hope I get, you know, to come back home. But you got to push those thoughts, you know, out

1370
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:44.80
of your head. You can't, I was stop people can't dwell on and you can't think about it. You can't,

1371
01:29:45.52 --> 01:29:49.52
you know, worry about what's going to happen. You got to just push through and whatever happens

1372
01:29:49.52 --> 01:29:54.08
does happen. But, you know, as long as you're not reckless and careless, you know, you can't

1373
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:56.96
affect what your out comes. You're going to be anyway. So you might as well just keep pushing forward.

1374
01:29:57.76 --> 01:30:04.16
Yeah, you know, you, um, and now you end up on this deployment, the the fog of the strong point

1375
01:30:04.16 --> 01:30:09.20
that you're in so small doesn't even have a name. Just like the middle of nowhere. This is strong point.

1376
01:30:11.28 --> 01:30:18.08
And you got there. What was the, what was the environment like there? I mean, the units that

1377
01:30:18.08 --> 01:30:24.24
leave always give real great advice and their commander told our commander, you're not going to

1378
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:28.08
really change a lot of stuff here with how the rules of engagement's now, because the rules of

1379
01:30:28.08 --> 01:30:33.36
engagement is over different, present, sees their different leadership changed. And they said, you know,

1380
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:38.64
when we go out, we take shape of cream, we line when we walked, you know, we come back. That's

1381
01:30:38.64 --> 01:30:41.44
all you're going to do. And of course, when we get there, we're hard charging, we're going to go

1382
01:30:41.44 --> 01:30:47.68
here, here, here, here and here and here. And SOPs changed the bow space all changed. We lived in

1383
01:30:48.88 --> 01:30:53.12
like my first one, I was on the big five. Second moment, I was in a row of little, uh, little

1384
01:30:53.12 --> 01:30:58.000
strong points and fobs. And then this one, we were just like, hey, here you go. We're going to hell

1385
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.24
after you're in your drop-toff. This is you. Three six of the around is all bad. And that's just how it was.

1386
01:31:04.24 --> 01:31:09.84
So we would go out the first day went out, got a huge firefight. And that's my guys really

1387
01:31:09.84 --> 01:31:13.52
understood. Like I wasn't a lot of schools. Like I went to college and went to jump at

1388
01:31:13.52 --> 01:31:18.88
just school. I went to the advanced leadership course, the ALC course for E6. So when I got back

1389
01:31:18.88 --> 01:31:24.08
and I got to the weapons squad leader spot, some of the guys didn't know who I was from anybody.

1390
01:31:24.08 --> 01:31:28.48
Got it. My first sergeant knew me, that's why I got this spot. But the other guys were like,

1391
01:31:28.48 --> 01:31:33.04
why the hell is this guy jokes around? He doesn't, he's not mean, he doesn't smoke anybody. He's,

1392
01:31:33.04 --> 01:31:37.92
you know, really, I was polite, I guess. And whatever, you know, normal everyday guy, I didn't have

1393
01:31:37.92 --> 01:31:41.76
this trip in my shoulder. After I first firefight, like two of the guys that came from a different

1394
01:31:41.76 --> 01:31:46.08
after unit were like, look, I didn't get while you were the squad leader, I didn't get how you got E6.

1395
01:31:46.08 --> 01:31:51.44
And while you were in charge, but now I do because, you know, when she hits a fan, I was,

1396
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:55.28
I was a guy needing to be there, I guess. Yeah, I mean, this firefight going to the book here,

1397
01:31:57.36 --> 01:32:02.48
sergeant Butler yelled, I'm hit. I'm hit. One of his team leaders, sergeant, Marty Miller ran over

1398
01:32:02.48 --> 01:32:08.000
to him and swept his hands long, but there's body to look for blood, Miller ran back to our lieutenant

1399
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:18.08
report, we couldn't find any. And you just, you sprint it out into this riverbed during this fire

1400
01:32:18.08 --> 01:32:22.000
fight, it's going on. And here you are, I'm still one of my body armor, but I was essentially

1401
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.40
weaponless. If I'd kept my rifle, it would only slowed me down. I ran over to where sergeant

1402
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:31.04
Butler lay, he was probably 50 meters total away. It's my leg, he shouted, I can't put any weight on it,

1403
01:32:31.04 --> 01:32:36.64
shut up, I yelled. Get on my back now. Let's go without waiting for him to answer. I grabbed

1404
01:32:36.64 --> 01:32:41.36
his right hand with my left squatted down and threw him over my shoulders and a fireman's carry.

1405
01:32:41.36 --> 01:32:48.72
He was probably 185 pounds. I hefted him up and ran back to safety. So there you go, just,

1406
01:32:50.40 --> 01:32:55.20
I understand after you perform like that in a firefighter, boys, like, oh yeah, we get it.

1407
01:32:55.20 --> 01:33:01.52
Well, we, yeah, so we were, on one side of the water, the driver of a bed, and my CEO was like,

1408
01:33:01.52 --> 01:33:05.68
we're going to cross this riverbed. I'm like, all right, I mean, that's really, really open,

1409
01:33:05.68 --> 01:33:11.76
but let's do it. So first, second, and headquarters, whatever, went across. Right. And just, just,

1410
01:33:11.76 --> 01:33:15.28
I always have to point this stuff out, because we have a lot of guys that are in the military that

1411
01:33:15.28 --> 01:33:19.68
listen to us. And so you're just doing a classic cover move. One element's going to stay back on the

1412
01:33:19.68 --> 01:33:23.76
high grid, or on one side of the river to cover as the other element's pushing across. Yeah, and this

1413
01:33:23.76 --> 01:33:27.28
was our first day in country. So we're just trying to learn the balance base. Because we were thinking

1414
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:33.20
about setting up another OP or strong point on the, on the, on the water, because there's a lot of traffic.

1415
01:33:33.20 --> 01:33:39.28
And they start to move over over there, and they get about 50 meters away, 75 meters, whatever,

1416
01:33:39.28 --> 01:33:43.84
and then all hell breaks loose. Shots, remember where. And third squad and four squad,

1417
01:33:43.84 --> 01:33:48.08
weapon squad, which is me, are over on the river, you know, riverbed. And we start laying in,

1418
01:33:48.08 --> 01:33:52.56
everybody ducks down, takes cover, and I'm still standing, and I'm yelling, and I'm one of my guns

1419
01:33:52.56 --> 01:33:56.64
are shooting to the far left, where she was shooting to the far right, he's the right element. So I walk

1420
01:33:56.64 --> 01:34:01.04
over and I kick the team leader, you know, actually, I think I might as, MAC just head real hard.

1421
01:34:01.04 --> 01:34:05.60
I said, you need to fix this, it's a fix it now, and I told him where to shoot. I went back over

1422
01:34:05.60 --> 01:34:09.44
and directed some more traffic, and then some of the, the other two teams there are some

1423
01:34:09.44 --> 01:34:12.88
of the third squad were just firing all their rounds. After we already gained the fire superiority,

1424
01:34:12.88 --> 01:34:16.40
so I yelled at them and said, you two, no better, you've been here before, control your rounds,

1425
01:34:16.40 --> 01:34:21.76
control your fire, and just make sure it's depressing. And then, Bother went down, and we're like,

1426
01:34:21.76 --> 01:34:26.88
oh, Bother just got hit, and he ended up tearing his MCLACL and Manisca, so whatever. I mean,

1427
01:34:26.88 --> 01:34:31.20
this is a pretty bad damage. And my first start was like, there's squad going get them.

1428
01:34:31.20 --> 01:34:35.44
And I said, oh, first I know where but I got it, so I took my weapon off, and I am for, you know,

1429
01:34:35.44 --> 01:34:39.44
as I hear, hold this for me, I tossed in my M4, because there's just, you know, it gets in the way,

1430
01:34:39.44 --> 01:34:44.000
you know, I ran down, and then the A and A were on the riverbank, right, kind of right behind me.

1431
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.80
They're like, I said, you guys do not shoot, but don't you, don't you shoot me in the back.

1432
01:34:48.80 --> 01:34:51.52
Sorry about that. I didn't get edit that, but maybe you don't. But I was like, don't you

1433
01:34:51.52 --> 01:34:56.08
guys shoot me, so I ran out and got them, took them back, and I set them down, so I ran out, 50,

1434
01:34:56.08 --> 01:35:00.24
you came back, and took them about about 50 to 80 behind the building, and set them down.

1435
01:35:00.88 --> 01:35:04.40
I sat down and get drink a lot of, first sight, my first sight goes, sorry,

1436
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:08.000
I'm going, I was going to need you back here. Okay, I ran back, I was like, oh, crap, where's my gun?

1437
01:35:09.12 --> 01:35:12.96
And Marty had it, somebody said, oh, here you go. And I was the last one on the objective.

1438
01:35:13.92 --> 01:35:18.40
We had to hike back two miles with Butler on the stretcher, but I was the last one with the F1,

1439
01:35:18.40 --> 01:35:22.08
the objective, pop and smoke for the kayak was to come over and cover our movement.

1440
01:35:24.80 --> 01:35:27.84
The two guys at yellow, the ones that told me they'd found me to hell them back, like we get it now,

1441
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:31.36
Sergeant Mills will follow you to hell back. Wait, they were just kept shooting, I'm like,

1442
01:35:31.36 --> 01:35:34.64
you guys are team there, you've been here, what are you doing? Yeah, that's awesome, man.

1443
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:40.64
This reality check. It's another example, I'm in again, just, you're talking about how you

1444
01:35:40.64 --> 01:35:44.16
are in leadership position, you're just backed off a little bit, you're, your pain and

1445
01:35:44.16 --> 01:35:47.84
intentional, what's going on instead of you being on your gun and shooting your backed off,

1446
01:35:47.84 --> 01:35:52.08
you're just watching, that's what you need to do in the leadership position. You got a back off a little bit,

1447
01:35:52.08 --> 01:35:56.000
you got to observe what's happening, you got to make sense of what's happening, and then you got to

1448
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.60
make sure that people are doing the right things. Yeah, I mean, you know, if I shot my gun,

1449
01:36:01.60 --> 01:36:06.32
I mean, that's great. I got to change shoot my M4 and do it had to do, but if I wasn't controlling

1450
01:36:06.32 --> 01:36:11.52
my two heavy weapons squad, you know, like I had the 240, that was the king of the battlefield,

1451
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:15.20
if you will, with the heaviest firepower, the housing charge of, they weren't doing the job the right way,

1452
01:36:15.20 --> 01:36:18.88
then we were all in trouble. Yeah, as I always say, God bless the machine gunners.

1453
01:36:24.88 --> 01:36:33.12
Yeah. And that, it sounds like that deployment was, I mean, the firefights that you talk about in here

1454
01:36:33.12 --> 01:36:41.28
were a lot, you get a lot of firefights every other day, if not every day. So this one here,

1455
01:36:41.28 --> 01:36:47.60
you went out and did this raid, and then you get word after you do this raid, that there's no

1456
01:36:47.60 --> 01:36:54.72
aircraft to come and pick you up from the raid and go ahead and walk back. Yeah, that's good times.

1457
01:36:54.72 --> 01:37:00.000
Yeah, we went out. We, I told my guys, like, look, it's gonna be hell, it's just bring extra. We had

1458
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.92
each of us, 2,000 rounds of 762. Dang. And then we also had, I always carried 2,000 rounds of

1459
01:37:07.92 --> 01:37:12.16
762, or I guess depending on the mission, it would change between a thousand and a thousand. And then I

1460
01:37:12.16 --> 01:37:19.76
carried 20 grenades, 10 on my armor and 10 in my bag, and then another 20, 40 micrys added 20,

1461
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:27.36
30, and then 425, 5, 5, 6 rounds, like not in my magazines, and I always had. That's like

1462
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:33.52
freaking 200 pounds. Yeah, but without ammunition, you're kind of screwed, that's really good point.

1463
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:39.60
So I always had 12 magazines on my person, and then I'd have 13th one in the chamber. So I had 13

1464
01:37:39.60 --> 01:37:43.36
full magazines on me, not because 13's like some special number, just because like my mag

1465
01:37:43.36 --> 01:37:48.56
pouch is weird. Yeah, my mag pouch was, you know, too deep, so I could have 6, 3 on each side.

1466
01:37:50.40 --> 01:37:55.44
Yeah, and we went out there and we ended up getting like 755 fights in my back home. We had 4 to 10 knees,

1467
01:37:56.32 --> 01:38:02.16
and I got, I got, I got put next to the gun the one time, and you know how, it's called

1468
01:38:02.16 --> 01:38:07.68
Pigtail and Ratel the Cup. When you put your 7, 6, 2 link in, you have one side come out, and then you

1469
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:11.04
you know, switch back it in, and then the other side come out. So when you hook to a gun,

1470
01:38:11.04 --> 01:38:13.76
it pulls out your bag, and then if you have another bag next to you, clip it together.

1471
01:38:14.32 --> 01:38:17.44
What we shot through all my rounds one, and one of the things we shot through all the 7,

1472
01:38:17.44 --> 01:38:22.56
6, 2 rounds, was like, oh, this is so much like lighter, and I got to another spot, and one of my,

1473
01:38:22.56 --> 01:38:28.32
my guy's Brandon, Feste, we've won the guy's with me later on, but he was almost knocked.

1474
01:38:28.32 --> 01:38:31.44
Like, past now, so heavy, I said, don't want me to take my bag. He goes, no, I got it, so as a,

1475
01:38:32.16 --> 01:38:35.60
give me your bag, don't argue with me, and I was like, you need to make it back to the fob.

1476
01:38:35.60 --> 01:38:42.96
And then our, our P.A. that came out with us, awesome guy, Ranger, regiment guy, and he's

1477
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:47.76
turning to the doctor. He was dehydrating really bad on the walk back, going hallucinations and stuff.

1478
01:38:47.76 --> 01:38:54.24
So, we decided, me and two other guys, three other guys, we're going to head just like,

1479
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:58.24
try to head and walk faster, and everybody else, and like, made it back to the fob first to get a,

1480
01:38:58.24 --> 01:39:03.68
get a m wrap to come get them. But, yeah, and we actually, one of the guys we detained,

1481
01:39:03.68 --> 01:39:10.08
we, we detained all these guys, they had 600 pounds home explosives, batteries, RPGs, and the thing

1482
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:15.76
was a drone filed their RPG team back on the morse I go to this compound, AK-47s, but we didn't

1483
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:19.44
get pictures with all their stuff. So, we turned it over to the local national government, and they

1484
01:39:19.44 --> 01:39:25.28
said, we didn't get pictures, these guys are, these guys are free, so let them go. Turns out,

1485
01:39:25.28 --> 01:39:30.72
the guy that, we had detained one of them, because we hide it them, fingerprints were all over my

1486
01:39:30.72 --> 01:39:35.44
bomb, and there were 13 bombs in a row, and they were all over the bombs that the one that I hit,

1487
01:39:35.44 --> 01:39:41.28
so the guy that we captured, as one to put the bomb in, Alpha Troop caught them, and you need to

1488
01:39:41.28 --> 01:39:50.64
take care of them. So, all right, sorry, I bring it down to town. I've been. No.

1489
01:39:52.24 --> 01:39:59.84
Going to April 10th, 2012, you get some intel in the afternoon that there's a,

1490
01:40:00.96 --> 01:40:05.20
ID out in the village, and you guys are going to go check it out, and here we're going to the

1491
01:40:05.20 --> 01:40:09.60
book. We hiked only about 400 yards to the village, in addition to my weapons team, there were

1492
01:40:09.60 --> 01:40:16.40
other squads along on patrol, a total of 28 soldiers. My lieutenant Zachary Lewis went to the left,

1493
01:40:17.20 --> 01:40:21.84
with the first and second squads heading to meet with the village elders, while the rest of our

1494
01:40:21.84 --> 01:40:26.56
men went with me around the village to the outside to offer support in case of an attack.

1495
01:40:26.56 --> 01:40:31.92
Along with my gun team I had, my platoon, sergeant, and a medic, sergeant Daniel Bateson

1496
01:40:33.28 --> 01:40:39.52
with my group, all looks calm. It was just another day and half Gannis Dan, another normal patrol

1497
01:40:39.52 --> 01:40:46.56
we approached an abandoned A&A security post to portable buildings and stopped near the buildings

1498
01:40:46.56 --> 01:40:53.92
to establish a security perimeter. I called for Fesi to bring the minesweeper. Check this area,

1499
01:40:54.48 --> 01:41:00.88
was the only order I gave. Fesi walked up a path used by villagers and scanned all the area around.

1500
01:41:02.16 --> 01:41:08.64
You went up and back and all was clear. No beeps. There was no reason to question anything.

1501
01:41:08.64 --> 01:41:13.52
Fesi finished his minesweeping duties and went up and went to set up on the far flank.

1502
01:41:14.56 --> 01:41:19.68
I called riot up to me and asked him where he thought we should put the gun.

1503
01:41:20.48 --> 01:41:25.68
I knew where it should go, but I wanted to let him decide making sure he knew his stuff.

1504
01:41:26.40 --> 01:41:30.56
He motioned to exactly where I thought we should put it, a good spot. And I said,

1505
01:41:30.56 --> 01:41:37.84
all right, go get an F and bring him up here. That was it. Riot left to go get an F. And as he did,

1506
01:41:37.84 --> 01:41:45.28
I set my backpack down. The backpack touching the dirt was all it took. Such a simple act of war.

1507
01:41:46.80 --> 01:41:56.40
My world erupted. I saw a flash of flame and heard a huge cobblum. Hot jagged pieces of explosives

1508
01:41:56.40 --> 01:42:03.12
ripped through me. I cartwilled backward and over-end, hit the ground and slammed my face hard

1509
01:42:03.12 --> 01:42:09.84
against the compacted earth. Instantly I felt my left eye starting to swell shut. I smelled

1510
01:42:09.84 --> 01:42:17.76
burning flesh my own. I tasted dirt and I was wet with sweat and moisture just like I'd walked

1511
01:42:17.76 --> 01:42:24.08
out of a hot shower. Dirt fell everywhere through the air. It rained down and clung to my eyes,

1512
01:42:24.08 --> 01:42:29.68
nose and mouth. I don't remember rolling over, but I must have because I glanced to the side and saw

1513
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:35.84
that my right arm was completely gone. I caught a glimpse of my left arm covered in blood and

1514
01:42:35.84 --> 01:42:42.32
tattered. My arm trembled as if it had a will of its own. I looked down and saw my right leg was

1515
01:42:42.32 --> 01:42:49.52
also gone. The stump looked like a piece of raw meat. The bottom of my left leg was still attached,

1516
01:42:49.52 --> 01:42:56.24
but held on only by a few strands of skin. I saw all this in a flash, in an instant.

1517
01:42:56.24 --> 01:43:04.72
I felt confusion, but no panic. My first thought of what was of my guys. I flop my remaining

1518
01:43:04.72 --> 01:43:09.36
arm toward the microphone clip to my carrier plate and somehow managed to push the button. I

1519
01:43:09.36 --> 01:43:16.32
hit a bomb. I said, I need help. Bates in my medic rushes up to me along with staff sergeant

1520
01:43:16.32 --> 01:43:22.08
Keith, hand-bright, arpatoon sergeant. Only about 30 seconds had passed since the blast.

1521
01:43:22.08 --> 01:43:26.000
Immediately they applied turnic hits to hold whatever blood was still inside me.

1522
01:43:27.68 --> 01:43:31.52
I'm not going to make it. I said, leave me and go to save my guys. Shut up, sergeant,

1523
01:43:31.52 --> 01:43:38.16
mills said, Bates in. Let me do my job. I ignored Bates and yelled my men's name like roll call.

1524
01:43:38.16 --> 01:43:46.32
Fesse, riot, nF to see if they were okay. Two were hit. Fesse and riot and other medics were

1525
01:43:46.32 --> 01:43:52.32
already caring for them. They were bleeding, but nothing was missing. They yelled back that they were

1526
01:43:52.32 --> 01:44:00.24
going to be okay. I calmed down. More soldiers ran toward me. Sergeant Alex voice another

1527
01:44:00.24 --> 01:44:06.72
medic wandered aloud where to best get IV access. There were no pulses to check except from my

1528
01:44:06.72 --> 01:44:14.000
carotid artery. He quickly ripped the open my vest, shaved the spot on my chest and put an IV

1529
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.32
straight into my sternum. It hurt going in and I must have hout because he yelled at me that I was

1530
01:44:20.32 --> 01:44:27.68
going to be fine. I yelled back, dock shut up. I know. He and I both calmed down.

1531
01:44:29.04 --> 01:44:33.60
Someone stuck a fence in all pop in my mouth. It's a potent pain killer that releases as the

1532
01:44:33.60 --> 01:44:39.04
pop dissolves. I down the first one spit out the stick and asked for another. You won't need it,

1533
01:44:39.04 --> 01:44:46.08
someone said. I was still thinking that I was going to die. I didn't want to show fear.

1534
01:44:46.96 --> 01:44:50.88
I didn't want to freak out. You never want to show fear around your men.

1535
01:44:52.72 --> 01:44:59.20
Let my family know I dealt with it without crying, I said. Tell them yourself, someone grunted.

1536
01:45:00.24 --> 01:45:07.20
He was being encouraging letting me know I wasn't dead yet. I tried to see around me. I raised my

1537
01:45:07.20 --> 01:45:12.48
head wanting to get a visual of feisty and riot. Someone shoved my head back down.

1538
01:45:13.68 --> 01:45:20.72
I still committed a voice. My one eye was swollen completely shut.

1539
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.48
The other eye was blurry from dirt. I tried to raise my head again. Again, I was pushed flat.

1540
01:45:27.12 --> 01:45:32.88
My eyes were watering now. The dirt turned into mud. Time passed and I didn't know what was happening.

1541
01:45:32.88 --> 01:45:39.76
I mumbled something that there was no reply. Only the study, or the black-awke helicopter

1542
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:45.44
touching down nearby. Six men surrounded me, hefted me up and carried me over.

1543
01:45:46.64 --> 01:45:50.64
All told, it might have been ten minutes since the blast until the helicopter arrived.

1544
01:45:52.16 --> 01:45:56.72
Fesce and riot were first inside the helicopter. Everything was foggy and noisy and I couldn't

1545
01:45:56.72 --> 01:46:02.24
make out my surroundings clearly. My two guys were on seats and I saw blood and bandages

1546
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:08.96
jumbled in their direction. Fesce had, strappin' on his face, riot had strappin' his face legs and hands.

1547
01:46:10.32 --> 01:46:14.96
Their image is faded away. I focused on the noise of the rotors.

1548
01:46:17.20 --> 01:46:20.40
We were in the air and the flight medic were taken care of me.

1549
01:46:22.32 --> 01:46:26.24
riot yelled and pain. I tried to look around. Someone needed to attend a riot.

1550
01:46:26.24 --> 01:46:30.16
Where are the medics? One of the medics was talking to the pilots up front.

1551
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:34.72
riot was yelling again. I looked in Fesce's direction and told him to calm down.

1552
01:46:35.84 --> 01:46:40.88
Fesce nodded. riot stopped yelling and I winked at him to let him know he was going to be okay.

1553
01:46:42.32 --> 01:46:43.68
It was all I could think to do.

1554
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:50.16
The flight medic was a back and view. I could barely seem through the group in my eyes.

1555
01:46:50.16 --> 01:46:53.12
You are a green flight suit and had a big Darth Vader helmet.

1556
01:46:53.12 --> 01:47:00.08
But I tried to speak. He gave me a quizzical look. I yelled as loud as I could. Take your helmet off.

1557
01:47:01.12 --> 01:47:05.12
He took his helmet off. Give my guys water and tell them they're going to be okay. I barked.

1558
01:47:06.32 --> 01:47:08.56
Don't worry. I'll take care of them for you. He said.

1559
01:47:09.76 --> 01:47:12.32
He was busy with some task on me that I couldn't see.

1560
01:47:13.52 --> 01:47:16.24
A moment went by and I added, I'm sorry.

1561
01:47:17.20 --> 01:47:18.56
For what? The medic asked.

1562
01:47:18.56 --> 01:47:23.52
For making you take your helmet off. He gave me a ride grin.

1563
01:47:24.80 --> 01:47:30.56
I realized he'd been doing his job all along doing it well. Both the medics had.

1564
01:47:31.84 --> 01:47:33.92
I just couldn't see all I was happening around me.

1565
01:47:34.56 --> 01:47:38.24
My mind went in and out. I was coherent but fuzzy in spots.

1566
01:47:39.84 --> 01:47:42.88
In 15 minutes the helicopter landed in Canterhar.

1567
01:47:42.88 --> 01:47:49.52
Hospital staff rushed me straight to the operating table. We're going to put you under now.

1568
01:47:50.08 --> 01:47:54.32
Came a voice from above me. I'm fine. I said, leave me alone.

1569
01:47:55.76 --> 01:47:58.24
The mask came over my face and I tried to push it away.

1570
01:47:59.52 --> 01:48:01.28
I remember asking one question.

1571
01:48:01.28 --> 01:48:13.68
Am I ever going to see my baby girl again?

1572
01:48:21.20 --> 01:48:26.48
A little intense. Yeah. My wife and some more choice words.

1573
01:48:26.48 --> 01:48:29.20
I didn't put the book. I said to the flight medic. I had yell three times.

1574
01:48:29.20 --> 01:48:32.08
Last time I threw the effort in there and I was taking a nap.

1575
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:36.000
In my head I was just taking a private Ryan.

1576
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:39.84
Don't go out for your mom like the medic when he got shot in the movie.

1577
01:48:42.40 --> 01:48:47.76
I was a guy that I had to snap around and I rolled in. I was so embarrassed to have rolled away from it.

1578
01:48:49.20 --> 01:48:52.72
I stood on top of the mountain and shot off a magazine in the half before I got back down.

1579
01:48:52.72 --> 01:48:58.24
The whole don't show fear. I figured I can't change what happened right now.

1580
01:48:58.80 --> 01:49:01.04
If I raise my pulse, I'm going to bleed faster.

1581
01:49:03.28 --> 01:49:07.92
Thanks to my battoons sergeant, sergeant, and docked baits.

1582
01:49:07.92 --> 01:49:11.76
Then docked voice. I was able to maintain most of my blood.

1583
01:49:12.80 --> 01:49:15.52
They must slap those things on you quick turnicots.

1584
01:49:15.52 --> 01:49:17.36
Then 20 seconds or 30 seconds I think.

1585
01:49:17.36 --> 01:49:24.08
Was the aircraft airborne somewhere and got redirected to you? How did you get a helicopter?

1586
01:49:24.08 --> 01:49:24.72
They're so fast.

1587
01:49:25.52 --> 01:49:29.28
We usually went out when there was helicopters on station.

1588
01:49:30.88 --> 01:49:32.64
Because the threat was so real.

1589
01:49:34.64 --> 01:49:37.04
Not that we needed to talk about this and you guys added it out.

1590
01:49:38.40 --> 01:49:43.28
At night time the Taliban had free reign to do what they wanted. We were told because of

1591
01:49:43.28 --> 01:49:48.48
politics or whatever somebody said we could go out at night time. We had the best night time capabilities.

1592
01:49:49.20 --> 01:49:53.36
We couldn't go out on the raid camera, 30 feet in the air. We would watch them on the screen

1593
01:49:53.36 --> 01:49:56.88
and watch them put bombs in at night time. We couldn't shoot them, shoot them,

1594
01:49:56.88 --> 01:50:03.36
motors at them and couldn't get them. It sucked because you'd watch them put the bombs in.

1595
01:50:03.36 --> 01:50:06.56
Then the next day we were supposed to go out and try to find them. That's why in 2012.

1596
01:50:06.56 --> 01:50:08.08
You say they wouldn't let you shoot them?

1597
01:50:08.80 --> 01:50:11.12
They wouldn't let us go out and get them. They're like, no, I can't go out at night time.

1598
01:50:11.12 --> 01:50:15.04
But we can see them. I don't know why you guys talk about it.

1599
01:50:15.04 --> 01:50:17.04
It does bother me. I can't really.

1600
01:50:17.04 --> 01:50:20.16
I don't like it. You don't get political so you don't have to.

1601
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:23.44
This with me. Just watching them put bombs and knowing I had to go out and try to find them.

1602
01:50:23.44 --> 01:50:28.80
Then the guy that I found or we walked back through seven different firevites and 10 clicks

1603
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:33.60
when they went out to do the surveillance on the site. I got blown up at that.

1604
01:50:34.24 --> 01:50:37.36
I've blown up at there was 13 in a row right there.

1605
01:50:37.36 --> 01:50:41.36
And if somebody's in the mines were brand and went up and down, not once but twice and nothing

1606
01:50:41.36 --> 01:50:44.80
alarmed them. There was six days of chain together called Squad Killer.

1607
01:50:44.80 --> 01:50:48.000
You had to be the front guy to hit the first one and then everybody behind them would get

1608
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.16
just taken out. So in a way, as probably better that I got hit that day than have somebody

1609
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:54.32
walk past and hit it and then everybody behind of you are taken out too.

1610
01:50:56.72 --> 01:51:00.40
Yeah, so just the politics of war I guess.

1611
01:51:00.40 --> 01:51:04.56
Kind of sucked because I would watch and put bombs in the Kyra was a command station.

1612
01:51:04.56 --> 01:51:07.84
The guy shooting at us a hundred yards away with dropped their weapons and walk away and I was

1613
01:51:07.84 --> 01:51:11.52
done there were no longer combatant until the Kyra was where out of fuel.

1614
01:51:11.52 --> 01:51:16.64
And we were going to run 1,000 meters this way because if we did then the guys just take

1615
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:22.24
either a case and take off. So, you know, the red tape. But when I got blown up,

1616
01:51:22.24 --> 01:51:27.60
I did rate on my LT and I got hit. I don't know how bad it is and I told my men

1617
01:51:27.60 --> 01:51:30.24
to get away from me and keep fighting me off and tell me somebody might drop.

1618
01:51:30.24 --> 01:51:34.88
Then the doctors worked on me for 14 hours. I was told nine doctors and seven nurses

1619
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:38.40
and two nurses for nine hours but I'm airing out of my lungs. Keep me alive.

1620
01:51:38.40 --> 01:51:43.68
Like took turns pumping air. I was so low on blood. They did over 30 transfusions.

1621
01:51:43.68 --> 01:51:47.04
Yeah. And they didn't have enough in stock. So they were like on the big speaker in

1622
01:51:47.04 --> 01:51:52.64
Canahar saying, A positive blood and universal, we need it now. And they were right from

1623
01:51:52.64 --> 01:51:56.48
I had a lot of tests I had to do for like, you know, a possible age idea or things like that

1624
01:51:56.48 --> 01:51:58.48
because it was just like they were just taking and putting it right in.

1625
01:51:58.48 --> 01:52:00.80
Yep. Cool. All right. Thanks for your blood. We're going to put it right in them.

1626
01:52:02.40 --> 01:52:05.36
They knocked me out medically. You know, maybe I'm conscious.

1627
01:52:06.40 --> 01:52:11.60
And they kept me like that for four days. So I just realized, you know, I always said God bless

1628
01:52:11.60 --> 01:52:15.20
the machine gutters but how about a little God bless the doctors and nurses for sure?

1629
01:52:15.20 --> 01:52:19.44
Oh, absolutely. And the medics. I mean, yeah, and the medics. I would tell my, I go and I speak. I

1630
01:52:19.44 --> 01:52:23.44
might one size about perspective and I tell them, you know, about the guys that I've not made

1631
01:52:23.44 --> 01:52:27.92
it back home and I'm thankful it's still be around and living and I'm going to keep living, you know,

1632
01:52:27.92 --> 01:52:33.36
four of them. And so that, you know, their sacrifice wasn't in vain because what happened to me is

1633
01:52:33.36 --> 01:52:37.12
nowhere near what happened to my buddy Francis Jean films of fourth or Frankie, great friend of mine.

1634
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:42.56
He died. You know, let me find a wife and a four year old at the time. So I'm thankful for the medical

1635
01:52:42.56 --> 01:52:46.80
advancements and Vietnam. A lot of guys didn't come back like me and I get sometimes people like,

1636
01:52:46.80 --> 01:52:50.40
well, we just didn't see people like you during the Vietnam where it just had so sad this happened.

1637
01:52:50.40 --> 01:52:55.44
And I say, well, that's the reason they didn't come back or, you know, so yeah, I mean,

1638
01:52:55.44 --> 01:52:59.28
the doctors knew how to tie things in and my calf muscles around the end of my left leg now,

1639
01:52:59.28 --> 01:53:08.24
I guess, for padding or something, just nuts, you know. But that was on the 10th and then I still

1640
01:53:08.24 --> 01:53:12.24
had my left hand when they, they got done working on me. My wrist had blown up pretty bad by

1641
01:53:12.24 --> 01:53:18.08
my finger, my index, my middle of my thumb. And then two days later in Boggram, they cut it off.

1642
01:53:18.08 --> 01:53:22.000
My brother-in-law flew in from his outpost to Candahar with me and escorted me because

1643
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.12
did you guys have to fill blue books out? I'm going to pour you to pour you to pour it.

1644
01:53:25.12 --> 01:53:27.92
We call it the blue book. It's like, if I die, bear me with this.

1645
01:53:27.92 --> 01:53:32.000
It's not a blue book, but we do. We do do that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't, it was, yeah,

1646
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.84
like a little blue pan. They called the blue book in the army, but it's like, if I die, you know,

1647
01:53:36.56 --> 01:53:39.60
I want my reddering, I want picture of my life and I'm a kid or, you know,

1648
01:53:39.60 --> 01:53:44.56
I want this music to play. Basically playing your funeral is kind of morbid, but I guess it's all right.

1649
01:53:44.56 --> 01:53:50.40
But he was the guy who was supposed to escort my body back home. So he came to where I was at,

1650
01:53:50.40 --> 01:53:55.60
and then they shipped me to Boggram on April 12th. And I was told they took a look at my hand,

1651
01:53:55.60 --> 01:53:59.28
like it's not going to make it. It's just necrotizing and, you know, limb length is a huge

1652
01:53:59.28 --> 01:54:04.40
thing, so they cut it off. And then so they didn't tell him they're doing it. So I rolled

1653
01:54:04.40 --> 01:54:09.12
into surgery and I came back into my hand was gone. But I didn't know because I was still, you know,

1654
01:54:09.12 --> 01:54:15.84
manic or sedated. And then two days later they went for the very first time on April 14th. And I woke

1655
01:54:15.84 --> 01:54:19.60
up in the room. My brother-in-law, he was going to tell me, but what I don't know if I put it in the book.

1656
01:54:19.60 --> 01:54:24.48
I don't think I did. April 14th actually my birthday. So my 25th birthday I found out as a quadruple

1657
01:54:24.48 --> 01:54:30.000
amputee. And it's funny because my first deployment when I didn't know about eight mutations and

1658
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.84
things and Josh was just a friend of mine. I got my brother-in-law. I was like, look, I'm very athletic.

1659
01:54:33.84 --> 01:54:37.68
I play on sports. If I lose a leg or something, just let me bleed out. Like, I mean, I was that

1660
01:54:37.68 --> 01:54:42.72
naive at 19 years old. Like if I lose a hand, just I don't need to live, you know, because I didn't

1661
01:54:42.72 --> 01:54:48.000
know any different. We're now I have I wake up no harm to the legs. And I'm like, oh, okay, well,

1662
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.60
at least I made it, I guess. There. Meanwhile, back on the home front, going to the book,

1663
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:00.48
Kelsey received a call at 11.53 a.m. her time while standing in her parents' kitchen and Dallas

1664
01:55:00.48 --> 01:55:08.80
taxis years making a tune of fish sandwich. And then it's the commander on the phone. And she describes,

1665
01:55:08.80 --> 01:55:15.76
you know, he tells her straightforward, you know, the severe injury. And this is what she wrote in her

1666
01:55:15.76 --> 01:55:21.44
journal. I could not wrap my head around the pain. My husband must be feeling. I was all alone in the house

1667
01:55:21.44 --> 01:55:26.16
and my actions upset. My daughter to the point where she was screaming. I could do nothing to

1668
01:55:26.16 --> 01:55:31.20
sue her. I couldn't pick her up. I couldn't look at her. My body felt like he was being torn into.

1669
01:55:31.92 --> 01:55:37.76
I wanted so badly to be able to talk to Travis and let him know. I love him and that I think

1670
01:55:37.76 --> 01:55:47.68
God that he was still alive. Then it continues on Kelsey called my dad and Michigan, but when she tried

1671
01:55:47.68 --> 01:55:53.36
to tell him what happened, little would come out. My dad knew something was wrong and kept repeating,

1672
01:55:53.36 --> 01:56:02.88
is he alive, is he alive, is he alive? And then your dad said this, until you go through

1673
01:56:02.88 --> 01:56:06.64
something like that, yourself, it's hard to describe the feeling. There's no eating anymore.

1674
01:56:06.64 --> 01:56:12.24
You don't leave the house. There's a lot of pacing around to just wait. Whenever the phone rang,

1675
01:56:12.24 --> 01:56:25.60
we jumped. You look at the phone and you don't know if you want to answer it or not. So,

1676
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:36.32
it wasn't obviously, it wasn't just you that got hit too. Your family back home gets hit with the

1677
01:56:36.32 --> 01:56:43.60
shock of all this and also in your squad. There he is. Yeah, there he is. Which is the coolest

1678
01:56:43.60 --> 01:56:49.36
name ever. Because it spells the riot. I mentioned him earlier. But yeah, he got wounded.

1679
01:56:50.08 --> 01:56:54.24
He was pretty bad. I mean, he was able to get up and walk a couple days after. He was,

1680
01:56:54.24 --> 01:57:00.16
he was so afraid quite a bit. And then Fessie got hit as well. He did. And luckily he had his sunglasses on

1681
01:57:00.16 --> 01:57:06.96
because his face was just blasted. But he still has his vision doing great. He just got engaged.

1682
01:57:06.96 --> 01:57:13.28
So, I mean, yeah, it's just a bad day. You know, my dad, when he says he don't eat and do that stuff,

1683
01:57:13.28 --> 01:57:17.44
he actually was in the hospital with me and he got diverted. He lied us real bad. And he almost died.

1684
01:57:17.44 --> 01:57:21.12
He was so dehydrated. He had to go in and like give him surgery and like get, yeah,

1685
01:57:21.12 --> 01:57:24.40
for six months, he'd probably be mad if I told everybody, but he had to close me back because he

1686
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:29.12
got so dehydrated. Because he cared, you know, it was just so, so worried some for him.

1687
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:34.40
And then when I woke up, I was kind of a dick. I didn't want to like, my brother and I was like,

1688
01:57:34.40 --> 01:57:37.76
you got a call, you know, Kelsey, you got a car and mom and dad. And I'm like, I'm not talking anybody.

1689
01:57:37.76 --> 01:57:42.40
You know, as you know, your anger, your set, your question and this got hate me and my bad person.

1690
01:57:42.40 --> 01:57:46.08
What did I do wrong in life to get this? I mean, I pay my taxes, you know, I have a family. Why

1691
01:57:46.08 --> 01:57:49.60
would this happen to me? And then a little bit goes to like four scumboards like with 10

1692
01:57:49.60 --> 01:57:54.72
a day and like, no, what the hell, you know, why did I live through this? Is this some kind of sick

1693
01:57:54.72 --> 01:58:00.24
punishment that for something I did wrong? And I mean, you come to a realization like, hey, you know,

1694
01:58:00.24 --> 01:58:05.28
what? Sometimes bad things happen to good people. It is what it is. You can't change it. You might

1695
01:58:05.28 --> 01:58:09.04
as well keep pushing forward. And it's nothing I did wrong in life. It's just what was slated. So,

1696
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:17.36
you know, as what happened. Yeah, I thought it was interesting. Um, um, that one of the guys on the

1697
01:58:17.36 --> 01:58:25.52
MetaVac bird, like, wrote a wrote a Facebook to Kelsey and was explaining, you know, what it was

1698
01:58:25.52 --> 01:58:34.40
like and and, uh, yeah, I mean, here's what he wrote. My name is first sergeant, wait, the other

1699
01:58:34.40 --> 01:58:40.40
medic, the other flight medic with staff sergeant, Hockersmith, you belong to a family of warriors.

1700
01:58:40.80 --> 01:58:45.12
Other wounded soldiers in the aircraft were injured and screaming, but your husband was more

1701
01:58:45.12 --> 01:58:52.88
more worried about, more worried about then than himself. He described, and then he describes

1702
01:58:52.88 --> 01:58:58.40
like how you were doing the thing and telling him to take his helmet off and, and, uh, you know,

1703
01:58:58.40 --> 01:59:02.08
here, coming back to the book. His face was dirty and there was dust in his eyes, but he never

1704
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:07.28
shed a tear. I replaced my mind a moment when he looked at the other wounded soldier at another

1705
01:59:07.28 --> 01:59:14.48
wounded soldier and went to re-insure him that it would be okay. My crew is still on duty in his

1706
01:59:14.48 --> 01:59:21.04
units area now. We go back to Kanda Haran Monday, but we won't go back the same way. I'm an E8,

1707
01:59:21.04 --> 01:59:25.04
but this E6 is the example for myself and others to emulate.

1708
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And I actually, I had to get my, I was strapped down, so I had to get my arm out,

1709
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.12
because when I was yelling at him, I was like, hey, take a hell off. I said, take a hell off

1710
01:59:35.12 --> 01:59:39.92
that finally, I got my arm off. I'm not sure how you've caught you, man. That's freaking crazy.

1711
01:59:39.92 --> 01:59:45.76
Good genes, I guess. You know, but I pull my arm out and I said, take your, you know, helmet off,

1712
01:59:45.76 --> 01:59:50.40
effort helmet off and I put my hand over my head to motion like, you know, as my arms

1713
01:59:50.40 --> 01:59:54.000
grouping down or whatever, but I just took your helmet off and then he did and I was like,

1714
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.60
give my guys water to him and be fine. And later, I did apologize for yelling at him and I was like,

1715
01:59:57.60 --> 02:00:02.48
I, and he's already held this war. Yeah. You know, but, you know, at that time, I guess,

1716
02:00:02.48 --> 02:00:07.76
maybe it was easier for me to like think about everything else going on except for myself. You know,

1717
02:00:07.76 --> 02:00:13.44
and I just figured it is what it is, whatever's going to happen. It doesn't do me any justice to

1718
02:00:13.44 --> 02:00:18.64
scream out of yell or be afraid. I mean, hey, I can't change what's going on right now. So just

1719
02:00:19.28 --> 02:00:26.16
do it best. I can't, you know, help situation. Yeah. Man. And Josh shows up like, you know,

1720
02:00:26.16 --> 02:00:29.28
you just talked about this and Josh just say, hey, I'm going to tell you straight.

1721
02:00:30.40 --> 02:00:35.36
Because you asked, you said to Josh, hey, am I paralyzed? And I'm going to the book here. No,

1722
02:00:35.36 --> 02:00:40.56
man, Josh said, you're not paralyzed. You don't need to lie to me. I whispered, I can take it.

1723
02:00:41.28 --> 02:00:46.000
I'm going to tell you straight. Josh knew I'd want to know the truth. You're not paralyzed.

1724
02:00:47.04 --> 02:00:53.36
But both your arms and legs are gone. The date was April 14, 2012.

1725
02:00:53.36 --> 02:01:05.44
Still the same day as when I'd heard the news. I was a quadruple amputee. It was my 25th birthday.

1726
02:01:07.44 --> 02:01:13.20
You talk about the pain. And I think this is something people don't get myself included.

1727
02:01:16.24 --> 02:01:20.56
The pain was so bad. Part of the pain was the thought of what I'd become. I could hardly

1728
02:01:20.56 --> 02:01:25.68
picture the new me. Yet the pain was more than emotional. It was the physical pain. It

1729
02:01:25.68 --> 02:01:31.44
caused my body. I felt like I was on fire. I tried to focus on my breathing and take stock of

1730
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:36.000
why my pain was so bad. Even if all the medications flowing through me, it still felt like I was

1731
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.16
in a red hot vice. I could hardly take it. I knew Josh would never lie to me. But my arms and legs

1732
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:47.04
still felt like they were attached. My hands felt like they were burning. Like someone was clamping

1733
02:01:47.04 --> 02:01:52.72
them inside of an industrial furnace. But my hands weren't there. The flames were eating away my

1734
02:01:52.72 --> 02:01:59.04
ligaments, my nerves, my skin, my legs, my phantom legs were clamped in that same fire.

1735
02:01:59.84 --> 02:02:04.88
Bolts of agony surge from limbs that weren't the register that weren't there and registered to a

1736
02:02:04.88 --> 02:02:10.40
brain that still was. The pain came and went, came and went, came and went.

1737
02:02:10.40 --> 02:02:17.12
Josh started in his seat and leaned or started in his seat and leaned closer. Travis,

1738
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:21.92
you need me to get the nerves. Nurse, I didn't say anything. I was itchy and sweating bad.

1739
02:02:22.48 --> 02:02:29.36
He pressed a buzzer. Then when I got a cool cloth and laid it on my forehead, the nurse came in and

1740
02:02:29.36 --> 02:02:35.36
up to my morphine. Just before I went under again, everything that I'd always drilled into

1741
02:02:35.36 --> 02:02:41.44
myself rushed through my mind. Never show fear. Never let your guys see you in pain. Don't cry out.

1742
02:02:42.72 --> 02:02:47.04
Even when I'd been lying on the ground right after the blast, I'd felt pain then, but I hadn't

1743
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:52.80
showed it. When that I view it shoved through my chest, that was painful, but I wasn't going to

1744
02:02:52.80 --> 02:03:00.08
complain then. You don't let people down. You just don't. But this time the pain was so bad. It was

1745
02:03:00.08 --> 02:03:09.44
still so bad, even with more pain killers in me now. So bad, so bad, so bad. This time, I wanted to do

1746
02:03:09.44 --> 02:03:18.32
the unthinkable. Two words rose and began to vocalize within my throat. Josh, I said,

1747
02:03:18.32 --> 02:03:30.80
yeah, what do you need, buddy? I swallowed and whispered two words. I quit.

1748
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:40.56
Yeah, not good. I don't know what, I mean, this is a lot of pain, I guess. I don't know why,

1749
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:46.32
you know, you said there any question like, am I going to be a burden on my family?

1750
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:50.40
Why, how, you know, my wife should she stay with me? I mean, what do I have left to offer?

1751
02:03:51.52 --> 02:03:55.20
My daughter am I going to be a monster when I get to see her finally? And then it's like,

1752
02:03:55.20 --> 02:04:01.60
why did I live through this? Why, why did I make it? Not that I guess angry I lived her at the time

1753
02:04:01.60 --> 02:04:05.52
of, you know, when that was happening. I wasn't so much angry, just more of a question like, why?

1754
02:04:05.52 --> 02:04:09.92
Well, what's the purpose? Why not just let me go up? My wife gets, you know, four and a thousand

1755
02:04:09.92 --> 02:04:14.64
from the government and then she can go remarry and have somebody that's able-bodied and live a happy life.

1756
02:04:14.64 --> 02:04:18.88
But, you know, a lot of questions are, you know, when you're sitting in the hotel room,

1757
02:04:18.88 --> 02:04:22.72
I mean, a hospital bed, you know, in the hospital room and you just got started to see me all the time.

1758
02:04:22.72 --> 02:04:27.44
You just never know what would think. And the military, it's easy. Everything is laid out for you.

1759
02:04:27.44 --> 02:04:30.24
The other mission today is that our plans, what we're going to do is how we're going to get it done.

1760
02:04:30.24 --> 02:04:37.60
There, it's just all unknown. And that pain, like, from missing limbs, it sounds freaking horrible.

1761
02:04:37.60 --> 02:04:43.28
Oh, yeah, I mean, it was like a spike getting drove through my heel, fingernails getting, like, just ripped off and then

1762
02:04:43.28 --> 02:04:48.56
seared and it was just, it would be bad. What causes that? Well, I mean, a lot of it is

1763
02:04:48.56 --> 02:04:53.52
Phantom Limping, so your nerves try to find where your hands and your feet are and if they can't find it,

1764
02:04:53.52 --> 02:04:59.12
they try to redirect and keep trying to find it. So it's just one experience getting, you know,

1765
02:04:59.12 --> 02:05:06.64
zap to another. And then they, you're probably going to talk, they had like, experimental things they

1766
02:05:06.64 --> 02:05:12.48
tried to tell me because it was so bad. And after the second one, they tried, I was like, oh, I feel a

1767
02:05:12.48 --> 02:05:17.12
little better than the doctor, like, was all excited. And I was like, oh, now the pain's back and I'm

1768
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:22.16
going to, you know, got all yellin out and pain and stuff and he just, he actually cried he felt so bad.

1769
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:26.40
Because it was to the point where they got to find some cure or I'm going to be so,

1770
02:05:29.44 --> 02:05:36.88
just an agony. Yeah, agony or I'll be so used to the medication that the doses are going to

1771
02:05:36.88 --> 02:05:41.28
get to the point where I'm just going to OD on them, you know, because I'm going to be so, so

1772
02:05:41.28 --> 02:05:44.40
they're custom. I can't think of the word right now. It's killing me. Uh,

1773
02:05:46.08 --> 02:05:50.56
telling me, yeah, yeah, yeah, my tolerance will be so high that I'm just going to end up OD.

1774
02:05:52.24 --> 02:05:58.08
Damn. Of course, you know, you're wondering where you get your sense of humor,

1775
02:05:59.04 --> 02:06:03.28
you're telling your dad what happened to you. Like, I stepped on a mind went flying through the air.

1776
02:06:03.28 --> 02:06:11.92
I did a 180. It was crazy. Well, Travis, my dad said the important question is, did you look good doing it? Yeah.

1777
02:06:11.92 --> 02:06:23.04
Yeah, I mean, I think I did. Yeah. Um, and meanwhile, Kelsey, she, you know, you've been

1778
02:06:23.04 --> 02:06:27.68
voicing some of these concerns like about, hey, can I even be a good dad now? Can I, I'm

1779
02:06:27.68 --> 02:06:32.96
going to be a burden? You're kind of telling Josh some of those things. And she told or he told

1780
02:06:32.96 --> 02:06:37.68
Kelsey, and here we go back to the book. My brother told me that Travis is nervous to see me because he

1781
02:06:37.68 --> 02:06:42.32
doesn't know how I will react or if I will continue to love him as my husband. These worries seem

1782
02:06:42.32 --> 02:06:46.64
so trivial to me, because I will love him through sickness and health until death through us part.

1783
02:06:47.84 --> 02:06:52.88
I'd not use those words lightly when we got married. I will be by his side every day for the

1784
02:06:52.88 --> 02:06:58.32
rest of our lives, whether he likes it or not. I know his natural reaction will be to push me away

1785
02:06:58.32 --> 02:07:03.20
because of embarrassment or feelings of letting me down, but I just wish I could constantly reassure

1786
02:07:03.20 --> 02:07:12.24
him that my love for him is unwavering. Yeah, when I saw her, I told her she should go,

1787
02:07:12.24 --> 02:07:15.44
I said, you know, hey, you should take what we have, the house of yours, the cars of yours,

1788
02:07:15.44 --> 02:07:19.68
sell mine, you know, whatever, and do what you need to do, and I'll financially fund whenever I can.

1789
02:07:20.56 --> 02:07:26.000
You know, and she was like, that's not how this works. I know the hand-to-cat parking,

1790
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:37.20
you know what you said, so sorry. Man, you are, there's like a level of lock involved when you get married.

1791
02:07:37.20 --> 02:07:42.48
I don't care who you are. You know, like, you could easily marry like Satan.

1792
02:07:43.68 --> 02:07:47.92
I know you, I know plenty of guys that have made some really bad. I came and called them bad decisions,

1793
02:07:47.92 --> 02:07:51.76
because it's just like, okay, I understand if you have this great-cording thing and all that,

1794
02:07:51.76 --> 02:07:56.000
and you're whatever, that you can make a good decision, and that's great. But like a lot of

1795
02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.20
guys in the military, you're young, and you're like, you know what, we're getting married. And there's

1796
02:07:59.20 --> 02:08:04.80
just like a flip of the coin, and you got a saint. I mean, I literally did, I'm like 17 days in

1797
02:08:04.80 --> 02:08:08.96
person, you know what, it would be great. We just went to Mexico and then it's how we're going to get married,

1798
02:08:08.96 --> 02:08:12.56
and then we just got married. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's be a great story for everybody,

1799
02:08:12.56 --> 02:08:17.76
whether it works or not. Yeah, man. You scored, first year.

1800
02:08:17.76 --> 02:08:25.20
Sure. She got lucky to have me, too. Well, I didn't really pick that up, but um, okay, we'll go with it.

1801
02:08:25.20 --> 02:08:30.08
Yeah, we can. Yeah, we can. Yeah, I wasn't really far close for the first time. So you need to get back

1802
02:08:30.08 --> 02:08:36.88
to Walter Reed. I did. Yeah, I got 17th. I got back. And the first time I got to see Kelsey

1803
02:08:36.88 --> 02:08:40.64
wasn't that home-ark moment, you know, it's like, oh my gosh, I love you so much. It was actually

1804
02:08:41.36 --> 02:08:46.48
I was getting rushed in. I really, one of my right leg ripped open. And like Mrs. Mills,

1805
02:08:46.48 --> 02:08:50.000
you're in charge of medical history now. You have the signs piece of paper. He has to get

1806
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.28
to inches of coffee right leg when you're, you know, consent. She's like, what? She was passes out and

1807
02:08:55.28 --> 02:08:58.72
like Mrs. Mills, I'm like, Kelsey just sign the paper and I'm yelling, just sign the paper. It's okay.

1808
02:08:58.72 --> 02:09:03.20
And she signs it. That's the first time I got to see it. Just real quick. Yep, go ahead and hack them up.

1809
02:09:03.20 --> 02:09:08.08
And they went and took my leg to inches off on the right and resealed it. Next day's when I tell her,

1810
02:09:08.08 --> 02:09:12.56
like, you know, this isn't probably anything that you signed up for. You, you can go, you know,

1811
02:09:12.56 --> 02:09:16.32
you're no, it's no big deal. I'm not worried about it. She's like, nope, not how this works. We'll

1812
02:09:16.32 --> 02:09:20.64
get through it together. And then they, you know, they induce me into this coma later on because the

1813
02:09:20.64 --> 02:09:25.84
pain was so bad. And I was getting my tolerance level built up for the pain meds. And she sat with my bed

1814
02:09:25.84 --> 02:09:29.52
like 20 hours a day and knowing I wasn't going to wake up for five days. Like we're going to put them

1815
02:09:29.52 --> 02:09:34.64
off for five days. So yeah, so this was crazy. Read about in the book, you, you're in such horrible,

1816
02:09:34.64 --> 02:09:41.76
horrible pain. Like undescribable pain. Is this basically an experimental thing procedure that they did on

1817
02:09:41.76 --> 02:09:46.80
you? Yeah, I'm the second, the nation never have the ketamine coma and 30th in the world.

1818
02:09:46.80 --> 02:09:55.20
And Sonic's studies on me. The ketamine coma is 600 milligrams of ketamine per hour.

1819
02:09:55.20 --> 02:10:00.000
Yeah, so it goes around the clock. Mm-hmm. That's a whole thing. Well, it's based on like waiting

1820
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.68
things. So I'm sure like it's different measurements. But they, when they did it, you go in and then

1821
02:10:06.40 --> 02:10:09.52
they just circulates through it. It's supposed to reset your brain to think where your nerve

1822
02:10:09.52 --> 02:10:15.12
Zen is where they end and you know, you come out and it's just you hallucinate like crazy.

1823
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:19.44
Yeah, and nothing on TV is what was we're alive to me. Yeah, no, I'll hit some highlights from

1824
02:10:19.44 --> 02:10:23.68
your hallucinate because when you get done out of the coma, you're going to come up for five days

1825
02:10:23.68 --> 02:10:29.44
which is just black nothing, right? There's no nothing, nothing there. Then you go into hallucinations.

1826
02:10:29.44 --> 02:10:35.44
You got chasing kids that stole things from Walmart. You got gangascon that you're out with

1827
02:10:35.44 --> 02:10:42.000
gangascon. Your a squat team is coming to get you. You got you and your cousins are writing skateboards

1828
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.64
in a TV reality show. You got yourself playing hockey in the NHL. I was particularly concerned

1829
02:10:48.64 --> 02:10:52.96
about a 50-year-old go-go dancer that crawled on a leash down the hallway of Walter Reed. That one

1830
02:10:52.96 --> 02:11:00.24
made me a little bit nervous. Oh, this is service dog apparently. Cramer from sign-feld stops by.

1831
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:05.36
So you go through these massive hallucinations. That's freaking weird. Yeah, I mean, it got to

1832
02:11:05.36 --> 02:11:10.56
point where I'd get out of my tangent and they said for the first like seven days, you know,

1833
02:11:10.56 --> 02:11:14.40
it's going to be bad then after that, it'll start to fade out. At ten days, you should be able to tell

1834
02:11:14.40 --> 02:11:19.36
when you're having one or not. But I remember my final come in one morning in the caps game was

1835
02:11:19.36 --> 02:11:22.24
on the night before I was watching it. I was like, I scored nine goals with a little veg. I had

1836
02:11:22.24 --> 02:11:26.80
a triple hat trick. He's like, oh, that's great. And then I thought that way I got blown up.

1837
02:11:26.80 --> 02:11:30.40
And I woke up the very first day. I thought that this guy from my hometown made a

1838
02:11:30.40 --> 02:11:51.20
drug at Torrecomment towards my mom, my wife, my daughter and my buddy's not jumping to car and

1839
02:11:51.20 --> 02:12:01.36
we're just going to go with this. And I called enough my buddy's a message and I'm like, I'm so, I hope you're not dead.

1840
02:12:01.36 --> 02:12:05.92
I finally came out of his nation and I realized what happened to my brother my walk back in. I was like, hey man,

1841
02:12:05.92 --> 02:12:07.28
thanks you dick. Why didn't I tell you any different when I was like, yeah, I understand. You know, that's like,

1842
02:12:07.28 --> 02:12:12.72
don't text when you're drunk or whatever. Don't don't call people leave messages when you're on seven

1843
02:12:12.72 --> 02:12:16.88
day who used to do the trips. I only left two messages and they were trying to best friend. So it was cool.

1844
02:12:16.88 --> 02:12:21.92
And both of them was I'm sorry I killed you. Did I hear me? Oh, we're done. I think I killed you. And then

1845
02:12:21.92 --> 02:12:26.72
I got to the point where I could tell what was going on. So I like I started having another one

1846
02:12:27.84 --> 02:12:31.36
and then I was like, oh, I had hallucination. And then finally I got to the point where I was playing with people.

1847
02:12:31.36 --> 02:12:34.64
Like Josh was in my room and I was like, Josh, because what? I see dead people.

1848
02:12:35.36 --> 02:12:37.12
He said, what? You see or something? I'm just kidding.

1849
02:12:37.92 --> 02:12:39.92
I was like, okay. And that's how I look at the ceiling. He was like,

1850
02:12:40.64 --> 02:12:44.08
all around me. He's like, where? I'm like, oh my gosh, Josh, you're wearing that. Like,

1851
02:12:44.08 --> 02:12:49.12
jad him. And he's like, you're so dumb. So I started messing people once I got the hang of it.

1852
02:12:50.32 --> 02:12:55.44
That's awesome. And that kind of like did it, though, right? Like, yeah. Yeah. So I did about five

1853
02:12:55.44 --> 02:13:00.72
more months of pain pills. And then finally like an October I was home for Thanksgiving and North Carolina

1854
02:13:00.72 --> 02:13:03.92
at my house at Fort Bragg and I was just like, you know what? Kelsey came in. I was out of

1855
02:13:03.92 --> 02:13:08.16
wanting to more him done. She was like, you can't just quit the season. I said, no, I really am done. So

1856
02:13:08.16 --> 02:13:13.84
it was like five days of pain. And then now no medication, nothing I'm good to go. So the kid

1857
02:13:13.84 --> 02:13:18.16
me come one of my documentary, you know, it says, I won't do it again. But that was five months after

1858
02:13:18.16 --> 02:13:22.24
the fact, I was still like doing pain pills and stuff. I were four months after the fact that

1859
02:13:22.24 --> 02:13:27.28
guys could do in September. But looking back like that was the best the best thing for me to get me

1860
02:13:27.28 --> 02:13:32.16
past the, you know, the pain part and then on to my recovery. You have a second person that ever had

1861
02:13:32.16 --> 02:13:37.04
that done. I guess in the nation. That's crazy. I guess. Yeah. Um, other there's a great

1862
02:13:37.04 --> 02:13:42.08
talk about your kind of transition mentally going back to the book back in normal days. I love the

1863
02:13:42.08 --> 02:13:46.000
challenge. The quest to succeed in the army. It always been a challenge for me. My situation

1864
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.84
now is quadruple amputee held the out the same sort of dare to succeed. Sure, if I could have

1865
02:13:51.84 --> 02:13:57.44
changed things, I wouldn't have been in the situation. But I couldn't change things. Being a quadruple

1866
02:13:57.44 --> 02:14:05.04
amputee was my new reality. I could quit for good. I could shut myself off from the world. I could

1867
02:14:05.04 --> 02:14:13.28
will myself to die or I could fight forward and keep on living. I could legit. Well, I mean,

1868
02:14:13.28 --> 02:14:17.04
it came down to a choice at the end of the day. Um, I was still here in my life. I was going to say

1869
02:14:17.04 --> 02:14:20.24
what my side, my daughter, who I think is going to think of a monster, still laughs and snuggles

1870
02:14:20.24 --> 02:14:23.76
up with me. And, you know, I mean, when she first saw me, I thought she was going to be really

1871
02:14:23.76 --> 02:14:27.20
fraili, but then short arm short legs, fuzzy chest, I look like a teddy bear. It was like,

1872
02:14:27.20 --> 02:14:33.04
oh, another toy, you know, but this one can talk. Yeah. Cool. And I've never been

1873
02:14:33.04 --> 02:14:36.32
stern with my mom. I did break my mom's nose one time, the whole different story.

1874
02:14:37.52 --> 02:14:41.68
Karate? I know my dad, me were slapboxed in the kitchen, which meant I was 17. My dad was trying to

1875
02:14:41.68 --> 02:14:44.72
mess with me, but if I slap back, you feel like you did you could take me? And I'm like, no,

1876
02:14:44.72 --> 02:14:48.40
but I thought we were just playing. But he slapped at me. My mom was behind me, and I caught her

1877
02:14:48.40 --> 02:14:55.04
back in my head. Scariest day in my life. Um, you don't make her mad. And, but anyway, so I was only

1878
02:14:55.04 --> 02:14:58.72
stern one time. My mom, I woke up, you know, and I was supposed to get all the rest I could. And I said,

1879
02:14:58.72 --> 02:15:01.76
where's Chloe? Yeah. She's like, oh, they are keen to visit, but you were sleeping. I said, don't

1880
02:15:01.76 --> 02:15:05.60
ever let me sleep to that again. That's the whole reason that I'm able to still keep functioning.

1881
02:15:05.60 --> 02:15:11.20
It's because of my daughter and, you know, being there in my life. But, you know, the mental part was

1882
02:15:11.20 --> 02:15:15.20
the worst. And that four o'clock, just hit clock at night. I couldn't have the lights on in my, in my

1883
02:15:15.20 --> 02:15:19.04
apartment. Something to do. I thought it was like the operating table. I'll start sweating real bad.

1884
02:15:19.68 --> 02:15:24.24
I just, I mean, now I'm fine. But, um, the first, like, you know, five, six months, I was just like,

1885
02:15:24.24 --> 02:15:29.28
no lights at this time. It's quiet out where. And it's like that. And man, I started watching, like, I

1886
02:15:29.28 --> 02:15:32.96
watched a, you know, video view as you were training as you were now re-learning everything.

1887
02:15:32.96 --> 02:15:37.12
Look, and I never really understood when people say, oh, you got to re, you know, got to

1888
02:15:37.12 --> 02:15:40.96
re-learn the walk and you got to re-learn. And I didn't really make sense about it. But it's really

1889
02:15:40.96 --> 02:15:47.60
clear to see when you watch your progression. What that looked like. Like how you were clearly

1890
02:15:47.60 --> 02:15:51.44
re-learning how to walk. Like I never understood that. But when you watch the videos and the

1891
02:15:51.44 --> 02:15:56.48
progression that you made, you can see that that's what it's, it looks like when you first

1892
02:15:56.48 --> 02:16:00.56
stood up, I'm like, oh, yeah, it looks like he's learning how to walk and sure enough. You got

1893
02:16:00.56 --> 02:16:05.12
better and better and it's pretty amazing. And, and two things you're going to find out when I was

1894
02:16:05.12 --> 02:16:08.88
just going to my recovery. The first thing I learned how to walk with my daughter, which was kind

1895
02:16:08.88 --> 02:16:11.84
of cool. They got me those short legs and I was stumbling around and she was stumbling around

1896
02:16:11.84 --> 02:16:16.72
and holding hands. And the next thing you found out my love for Philly Chee Stakes, because I do

1897
02:16:16.72 --> 02:16:21.84
less workouts and stuff like that. The gym, you know, as you go, but I went from 250 to 140.

1898
02:16:21.84 --> 02:16:25.28
And I was real skinny. And then I'll have son, I start getting fatter in fatter in fatter because

1899
02:16:25.28 --> 02:16:29.76
of Lyrka and the medication. And I was like, oh, I love Philly Chee Stakes. So I'm trying to work on

1900
02:16:29.76 --> 02:16:35.84
that now. But my progression is like, I got better. I got fatter too. And you got to visit

1901
02:16:35.84 --> 02:16:42.08
from a guy named Todd Nicely. And that must have helped out a lot. My competitive edge did. He walked

1902
02:16:42.08 --> 02:16:46.08
in on his fake legs and two fake arms and he first thing I had his mouth was, hey man, welcome

1903
02:16:46.08 --> 02:16:50.48
to the club. I was like, I don't mean your club. So kind of late now, don't you think? And I

1904
02:16:50.48 --> 02:16:54.72
looked at myself and I was like, oh, you got me there. And as you walked over, I said, you want

1905
02:16:54.72 --> 02:17:00.48
a ginger ale. And he heard me wrong. And he went over to the counter or the sink. And underneath the

1906
02:17:00.48 --> 02:17:06.000
sink was a 12 pack of ginger ale. I got hooked on it like crack at the hospital. I got off it now.

1907
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:11.28
But either way, he bends down on one knee, bends down on his other knee, reaches on with his fake

1908
02:17:11.28 --> 02:17:15.44
hand, gets it out pops at the top of the other arm and walks over and hands and goes, here you go.

1909
02:17:15.44 --> 02:17:18.88
I'm like, oh, no, I was asking if you wanted one. But before I got the full sentence out,

1910
02:17:18.88 --> 02:17:23.04
I said, how'd you do that? He said, hey man, I'm Todd. And on the second ever, welcome to the club,

1911
02:17:23.04 --> 02:17:28.24
here's the fourth quadruple habitat to make it back home. You're going to be fine. Other Missouri,

1912
02:17:28.24 --> 02:17:34.96
with my wife, I drive, I have a boat, I do whatever I want, I walk, it just takes time. And he's like,

1913
02:17:34.96 --> 02:17:39.36
I'll even work out with you tomorrow. You know, this is like, I'm still thinking I'm in hallucination mode.

1914
02:17:39.36 --> 02:17:45.44
This is like maybe eight, nine days after my, my, uh, ketamine coma. And he's like, I work out with

1915
02:17:45.44 --> 02:17:48.96
you tomorrow. So the doctors come in and I'm like, hey, I got to work out today. I'm like, you can't

1916
02:17:48.96 --> 02:17:53.20
work out. You know, I was like, no, no, seriously, I've been, I'm going to work out with Todd nicely. He said,

1917
02:17:53.20 --> 02:17:56.40
I can work out at one o'clock and I like, well, you're not ready. And I had to let him know, I was like,

1918
02:17:56.40 --> 02:18:01.92
I don't know what you don't get, buddy. I'm working out today. And he said, I'll think about it. So I call him every

1919
02:18:01.92 --> 02:18:06.40
half hour, four hour straight to the find said I could. And I went in the met Todd and Todd did a workout.

1920
02:18:06.40 --> 02:18:10.96
And I laid on my stomach with the pelvis pad on her, my under my stomach or whatever. So the stretch

1921
02:18:10.96 --> 02:18:15.60
my pelvis muscle back out. And he'd been back in a fell asleep 20 minutes. Best work out I've ever done.

1922
02:18:15.60 --> 02:18:23.36
But I started my recovery that day. And as far as the physical is easy, I like the physical challenge.

1923
02:18:23.92 --> 02:18:27.92
The mental was a hardest part for me. I mean, bar none. It was, it was the worst. You know,

1924
02:18:27.92 --> 02:18:30.72
I couldn't look myself in the mirror for a while there. Because I didn't like what I saw.

1925
02:18:30.72 --> 02:18:38.72
You know, seeing my arms gone, the scars just overall messed that that I was. And I was going to be

1926
02:18:38.72 --> 02:18:44.32
burdening all that. So it just, that's just how it went. So the more capable you got, the more comfortable

1927
02:18:44.32 --> 02:18:50.24
you got in your new skin. Yeah. Well, I found out that they let you go for one hour. And then

1928
02:18:50.24 --> 02:18:54.40
a physical therapy and a one hour of occupational therapy. And then let me do another one and another one

1929
02:18:54.40 --> 02:19:00.16
to turn into four hours of each. So eight hours. That's when eight hours a day at the gym in my recovery.

1930
02:19:00.72 --> 02:19:04.80
Well, at the gym and occupational therapy, learn how to use my hands, how to wash myself again,

1931
02:19:04.80 --> 02:19:10.40
how to dress myself again, learn how to drive, learn how to do all that stuff. But it took 19

1932
02:19:10.40 --> 02:19:16.24
months of at Walter Reed 13 months and paperwork was after that to get out. But doubles in.

1933
02:19:20.88 --> 02:19:28.08
And you, you, you, you eventually went and met your guys when they came home. No, that's

1934
02:19:29.12 --> 02:19:34.64
I did an awesome idea. I said some goals. When I was in the hospital, my birthday I called my

1935
02:19:34.64 --> 02:19:38.48
life for my mom and dad and I was basically really short. Hey guys, what's up and fun and love

1936
02:19:38.48 --> 02:19:41.84
you by? That's all I wanted to say. I didn't want to talk to have a conversation and go over what

1937
02:19:41.84 --> 02:19:47.36
happened to me. I kept it very short. But I told my brother and I said, I have to call my guys in my

1938
02:19:47.36 --> 02:19:52.40
unit. You need to find the number to my strong point and let me talk to him. So there's a picture

1939
02:19:52.40 --> 02:19:57.28
going around where I had a baseball cap or an ozone on patrol and I have sleeves rolled up and

1940
02:19:58.32 --> 02:20:02.96
helmet off sunglasses. I mean, everything out of standard as they, you know, they have standards or whatever.

1941
02:20:03.52 --> 02:20:06.40
And I got to hold my sergeant major and I said sergeant major, I'm so sorry. I understand if you

1942
02:20:06.40 --> 02:20:10.16
got to take my rank. I shouldn't have been out of uniform. I do apologize and now the pictures

1943
02:20:10.16 --> 02:20:14.96
were on public and he's like, you're crazy dude. Just get better. You're fine. And then I got to

1944
02:20:14.96 --> 02:20:19.60
hold my my guys and I told them guys I'm fine. I'll be okay. And I'll be there when you get back

1945
02:20:19.60 --> 02:20:24.88
from Afghanistan. I'll be there at the, you know, the ramp to give you guys a hug on my tall legs.

1946
02:20:24.88 --> 02:20:28.56
And it took me a while. I got my tall legs that morning when they got back. I had to work out

1947
02:20:28.56 --> 02:20:33.12
three hours and then the tall legs don't bend but like that wasn't wearing out but they make me

1948
02:20:33.12 --> 02:20:37.28
at least six foot tall at well. You can't take those legs home unless you can stand up when you fall

1949
02:20:37.28 --> 02:20:41.76
down. So the whole day the therapist walks up and says trust fall, they knock you down. You know,

1950
02:20:41.76 --> 02:20:45.20
what the hell? Like that's not a trust fall. Just push the catch me. That's supposed to close my eyes

1951
02:20:45.20 --> 02:20:48.16
and trust you're going to catch me. You're like, that's the catch. You got to give yourself back up.

1952
02:20:48.96 --> 02:20:53.20
The therapist's are great. No, I had, I had two of the best therapists that you could ask for.

1953
02:20:53.20 --> 02:20:57.12
No, I'm carryin' Joe and I got me, you know, back to where I was at. But I did meet my guys

1954
02:20:57.52 --> 02:21:01.20
and the first, the first time I got to hug was Doc Bateson. You know, it's a hey man. Thanks for

1955
02:21:01.20 --> 02:21:08.64
all you did. And then you end up doing a 5k. 5k run. So, I mean, that was another goal.

1956
02:21:08.64 --> 02:21:13.04
Yeah, so Todd Niceer came in when he met me. He had four firefighters also for telling the

1957
02:21:13.04 --> 02:21:17.68
towers 5k they do in New York City and they also, they partnered with Gary Snees and they built

1958
02:21:17.68 --> 02:21:21.60
houses and things like that for guys that have been through traumatic injuries and they were like,

1959
02:21:21.60 --> 02:21:25.60
hey, we're gonna have a 5k and September, we'll push you and I'll walk it and they're like,

1960
02:21:25.60 --> 02:21:28.96
well, yeah, but like, we'll push you as no big deal. I was like, no, you know what I'm saying?

1961
02:21:28.96 --> 02:21:32.88
Like, I'm just gonna walk it. And like, well, you don't have legs yet, but if you do walk it, that's cool.

1962
02:21:32.88 --> 02:21:38.08
So, I went out to New York City after my daughter's birthday the day after and walked the 5k.

1963
02:21:38.80 --> 02:21:41.76
I came out of the Brooklyn Battle of Tunnel thinking, okay, I'm gonna sit down now. Like, I'm

1964
02:21:41.76 --> 02:21:46.000
tired, I'm a back hurts, I got a mile, you know, 1.2 miles or something to go. By right leg

1965
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.44
I completely rubbed raw, I was bleeding inside my socket and I was like, it's good. I've met a goal.

1966
02:21:51.44 --> 02:21:58.08
I've walked over to, you know, two miles now. And I came out of the tunnel, there was 343 firefighters

1967
02:21:58.08 --> 02:22:01.84
with banners around their neck for 9-11 at the G's, okay. Well, if those guys didn't go out,

1968
02:22:01.84 --> 02:22:05.44
they were going to go down the flight stairs and then ultimately die, you know, trying to save

1969
02:22:05.44 --> 02:22:10.56
life, so I could finish this. So I did. I was soar, it was bad, but I didn't finish it.

1970
02:22:10.56 --> 02:22:17.60
And then, eventually, you're like you said, you're driving now. You went out and did like

1971
02:22:17.60 --> 02:22:24.16
mountain biking and skiing and all this other kind of just getting after it basically for

1972
02:22:24.16 --> 02:22:30.48
better, for lack of a better term. And then you retire, you retire from the, from the army.

1973
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:35.68
And what's your next move? Your next move is you figure out, you're gonna get a house and you're

1974
02:22:35.68 --> 02:22:41.44
gonna move to. I had to move to Maine. My wife is from Maine, originally. The heat doesn't do well with

1975
02:22:41.44 --> 02:22:45.92
amputees because your blood circulates faster. He comes back warmer. When you're really

1976
02:22:45.92 --> 02:22:49.60
seat from your body, it's head hands of feet, so I'm missing, you know, four or the five and then

1977
02:22:49.60 --> 02:22:53.60
my legs are capped off. So if I wear pants or if I wear shorts, it's the same. There's no

1978
02:22:53.60 --> 02:22:59.76
air hitting the third of my body. And yeah, so we decided we're gonna move to Maine. We didn't start

1979
02:22:59.76 --> 02:23:05.04
an on-profit to help with care packages at first, and then we grew it to the retreat center that we

1980
02:23:05.04 --> 02:23:11.12
have here in Maine. And really through my work at Walter Reed, when I was at Walter Reed, I was such

1981
02:23:11.12 --> 02:23:14.88
up the person. I was the same person as before the blast. I was still going in and have Keshia

1982
02:23:14.88 --> 02:23:20.32
Fridays because I made people annoyed, but other people loved it. I haven't walked Friday. Keshia

1983
02:23:20.32 --> 02:23:25.52
Fridays. I'd go put my take my phone and turn on Keshia on Pandora and we'd just rock out.

1984
02:23:26.16 --> 02:23:29.60
And the reason I unfortunately saw videos of you dancing,

1985
02:23:30.24 --> 02:23:36.72
cannot be unseen apparently. Burning to your right now, you're welcome. But, you know, they

1986
02:23:36.72 --> 02:23:40.80
started asking me if I'd meet people upstairs and it started out, hey, you know, Travis, we have a guy

1987
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:43.76
upstairs. I can't tell his name or his room number, but if you could talk to him, really help,

1988
02:23:43.76 --> 02:23:48.000
he's not in 41 and he's not in 43. But if you could find him, you know, and I'm not in

1989
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:53.44
Marine. So, you know, obviously I'm smart enough to find that there's number 42. I don't eat crayons.

1990
02:23:54.08 --> 02:23:58.72
But anyway, so I would go up and talk to him and then that turned into like, hey, we have PFC

1991
02:23:58.72 --> 02:24:03.44
Johnson. He's missing two legs. His mom is mother-in-law. His two kids are here. Can you go see him?

1992
02:24:03.44 --> 02:24:08.56
I told him you'd be up around this time. And that's how the book got started. My documentary

1993
02:24:08.56 --> 02:24:11.84
got started and then the foundation, which is because all the nonprofits that Walter Reed

1994
02:24:11.84 --> 02:24:15.44
doing great things, Kelsey and I wanted to give back. Some way, she had performed and this is how

1995
02:24:15.44 --> 02:24:23.28
we've decided, you know, that we can get back the best. So, I'm what tell, tell us more about the

1996
02:24:23.28 --> 02:24:28.08
foundation there. So the Travis Mose Foundation was started, really just for care packages overseas.

1997
02:24:28.08 --> 02:24:32.32
And then I went out to Colorado, and I go downhill mountain biking and doing things. And then I

1998
02:24:32.32 --> 02:24:37.04
realized that Walter Reed does a great job of taking the service member out there. The only thing that

1999
02:24:37.04 --> 02:24:42.56
the government doesn't lack, but because of the funds have to go to the soldiers, they don't

2000
02:24:42.56 --> 02:24:46.56
get to bring all the families. My wife got to go because I needed assistance. And things,

2001
02:24:46.56 --> 02:24:50.56
but a lot of the guys that could take care of themselves couldn't bring their loved ones. And that's fine.

2002
02:24:50.56 --> 02:24:56.32
That's okay. But we thought we could do something in that space. My whole reason for getting better

2003
02:24:56.32 --> 02:25:01.84
was my wife and my daughter easily. So we started bringing families out. We did it for one week

2004
02:25:01.84 --> 02:25:05.84
of a year. And we brought families out and show them how to do things adaptively. Kaya can canoe and

2005
02:25:05.84 --> 02:25:10.000
things. Then we did another one and it went so well with what we should buy properties. We bought a

2006
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:15.04
property. It's supposed to be a $500,000 project. Now's the $3 million project. We did our first

2007
02:25:15.04 --> 02:25:20.08
week of program. I mean, first year of programs this year. We did seven weeks, 56 families. And

2008
02:25:20.08 --> 02:25:24.80
we bring them up. We host eight families per week up to 40 people and we show them how to do things.

2009
02:25:24.80 --> 02:25:28.88
We have a place on the water for kayaking and canoeing and tubing and boating. And we just

2010
02:25:29.84 --> 02:25:34.64
do horseback riding and archery and all these activities. We have ropes course. And we just say,

2011
02:25:34.64 --> 02:25:37.92
you know what, I understand what you're going through. I understand it can get tough. Here's a

2012
02:25:37.92 --> 02:25:42.16
network of people that are just like you. Whether you live in Chicago and in inner city or you live

2013
02:25:42.16 --> 02:25:46.40
in the plains of Montana, reach out. Understand that these families are going through the same thing.

2014
02:25:47.04 --> 02:25:51.04
Feel comfortable when you come here. That you can fall out of a kayak and nobody's going to

2015
02:25:51.04 --> 02:25:56.88
freak out. They're going to understand what you're going through. And it's just as much of a place for

2016
02:25:56.88 --> 02:26:02.000
the loved ones. You know, the wives that can talk to other wives or spouses and the kids can run

2017
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.28
around see that you know what my dad has one leg missing and one arm. But this dad has two legs missing.

2018
02:26:07.28 --> 02:26:11.36
And that's pretty cool because they know what we're going through. And after our first year of

2019
02:26:11.36 --> 02:26:14.72
operations and running, it was such a great success. We're going to do strategic partnership with

2020
02:26:14.72 --> 02:26:19.28
other nonprofits that share our mission and they'll donate what it costs for a week and they'll

2021
02:26:19.28 --> 02:26:24.64
run their own retreats up here as well. So we're talking up with Goal Some of our families

2022
02:26:24.64 --> 02:26:30.88
as well as PTSD and TBI because right now I focus on limb loss or paralysation. But this hopefully

2023
02:26:30.88 --> 02:26:36.24
will run 40 or 45 weeks out of the year. It's all donation based and the cool thing is like as the

2024
02:26:36.24 --> 02:26:40.48
president and the six other board members I do have, we don't take a dime. We never will. We're

2025
02:26:40.48 --> 02:26:45.12
auditing ourselves right now. So we can go on the CFC, the combined federal campaign and tell a lot

2026
02:26:45.12 --> 02:26:51.12
given back. So it's been really rewarding and fulfilling and I'm glad to be out there helping these

2027
02:26:51.12 --> 02:26:55.44
families cope with their situation and telling that there's other people out there like you

2028
02:26:55.44 --> 02:26:59.52
keep going, never live life on the sidelines and it most importantly never give up and never quit.

2029
02:27:00.64 --> 02:27:04.80
If people want to help this organization, what's the best way for them to do that?

2030
02:27:04.80 --> 02:27:09.20
Visit the website Travis Mills.org. It has all the information on the foundation. It has

2031
02:27:09.20 --> 02:27:14.56
ways to donate online. There's ways to do volunteer options. We had people fly in just a volunteer

2032
02:27:14.56 --> 02:27:19.60
for the week and help us out. And there's also ways to do corporate sponsorships. We had

2033
02:27:19.60 --> 02:27:24.56
wayfair come in, donate all the furniture, new balance came in, donated to us and things like that.

2034
02:27:24.56 --> 02:27:29.44
So we're growing. We believe in our mission. We know we can do this and there's other things we

2035
02:27:29.44 --> 02:27:34.56
want to get accomplished out here. We need to build a multi-purpose center. We have a pool going in

2036
02:27:34.56 --> 02:27:39.12
and things like that. But it's all about giving back and the mindset of the service member that

2037
02:27:39.12 --> 02:27:46.88
we're trying to host and the family. The book, Tophas, they come. That's what we read today.

2038
02:27:47.60 --> 02:27:55.28
It's a great book. I read a small chunks of it. Yeah, you can pick that up anywhere, where they sell

2039
02:27:55.28 --> 02:28:00.80
books. And what about the documentary? So the documentary, it's called Travis, the Soldier Story.

2040
02:28:00.80 --> 02:28:07.44
It was done in 2014. And it was actually unveiled the GI film festival. And we took first place

2041
02:28:07.44 --> 02:28:11.52
in 55 short films. I got to meet Marcus and Melanie LaTrell at night. It was really,

2042
02:28:11.52 --> 02:28:16.96
really great to meet them. And now Netflix is sign-to-son for a two-year run. So we got on Netflix

2043
02:28:16.96 --> 02:28:20.64
and May. So if we want to watch that, it's on Netflix. It's called Travis, Soldier Story.

2044
02:28:21.68 --> 02:28:26.000
And it just tells a whole story. It just has iPhone footage of everything that Kelsey and I went through.

2045
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.48
Yes. And the two-medic says, cool. The two-medic say my life. I actually are reenacting. You

2046
02:28:30.48 --> 02:28:34.08
getting blown up. And the two guys got hurt. Are in the documentary as well. And my brother-in-law,

2047
02:28:34.08 --> 02:28:38.88
so I'll tell people that were there in the documentary. No, between the book and watching the documentary,

2048
02:28:38.88 --> 02:28:43.92
you get to see the faces and everything. It's really cool. It's really powerful. And

2049
02:28:45.20 --> 02:28:50.96
what about social media? How's your social media presence? It's not yours.

2050
02:28:50.96 --> 02:28:57.12
So, by any means, we're about 60,000 in some strong on our Facebook page. I do little videos.

2051
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.36
My daughter learned how to tie her shoes the other day. We taught her in the morning. And you know,

2052
02:29:01.36 --> 02:29:04.80
by like we taught her like seven to my nine o'clock, she's tying it by herself. Give it an intro.

2053
02:29:05.52 --> 02:29:10.24
To tying your shoes online. But just SSG, Travis Mills is my page. If you want to check it out,

2054
02:29:10.24 --> 02:29:15.04
share my story that really helps. And it's Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. You're on all three.

2055
02:29:15.04 --> 02:29:26.48
SSG, Travis Mills. That's where you can find it. Yeah. You know, you put the last thing in the book,

2056
02:29:26.48 --> 02:29:32.48
like the last line in the book. You said, 11 freedom to go forward, to love your family,

2057
02:29:32.48 --> 02:29:39.52
to make something out of your life, to never ever give up, to never quit. That success.

2058
02:29:39.52 --> 02:29:50.80
And obviously, in my opinion, if never giving up and never quitting is the definition of success,

2059
02:29:50.80 --> 02:29:54.32
then I think you're the most successful person I've ever met my life brother.

2060
02:29:54.32 --> 02:29:59.04
For real. Well, I appreciate that. I just, we realize that people that depend on you,

2061
02:29:59.04 --> 02:30:03.20
the people that went into all this and the lives that are lost. I mean, you've had a lot of bodies.

2062
02:30:03.20 --> 02:30:09.36
I'm sure they did make it back home. My situation is not life-ending. My situation is just

2063
02:30:09.36 --> 02:30:14.24
I got a couple more steps in the morning for my legs on, come on, take my daughter, tomorrow's

2064
02:30:14.24 --> 02:30:17.60
actually my daughter's orientation at school. I get to take her. My wife and I just had a baby.

2065
02:30:18.64 --> 02:30:22.000
And I named her, I named her a little boy after my two medics. His name's Dex,

2066
02:30:22.40 --> 02:30:25.92
D.A.X. After Daniel N. Alexander for the medics at St. My Life. So,

2067
02:30:26.56 --> 02:30:31.20
thankful to still be here, through all this smoking and dirt in the dust. It's all settled now.

2068
02:30:31.20 --> 02:30:34.88
And I'm living life to the fullest and doing the best I can to make sure that people understand

2069
02:30:34.88 --> 02:30:42.08
life goes on and to never, ever give up and never quit. Anything else? Any closing thoughts?

2070
02:30:42.08 --> 02:30:46.08
I mean, I just obviously want to thank everybody when to this. I mean, from my unit on the ground,

2071
02:30:46.08 --> 02:30:50.48
I know I was a heavy guy. Walk around, wait 400 pounds. I'd get, you know, with all my gear on.

2072
02:30:50.48 --> 02:30:54.32
And all that to get me out there was great. The medical staff, doctors, nurses,

2073
02:30:55.28 --> 02:30:59.76
physical therapists, occupational therapists, everybody. I obviously my family went into it. I want to say

2074
02:30:59.76 --> 02:31:05.12
thanks for being there on my side. My beautiful life and my wonderful children for, you know, really

2075
02:31:05.12 --> 02:31:09.84
accepting what happened and moving forward in life. And just, you know, there by no, you know,

2076
02:31:09.84 --> 02:31:13.36
you can't always affect your situation, find yourself in, but you always can affect your attitude.

2077
02:31:13.36 --> 02:31:18.72
And that's, that's where I find the most, uh, I guess the most realization in my situation. I can't

2078
02:31:18.72 --> 02:31:22.96
always affect, if I drop something on my hand, you know, I can't pick it up right away or I have to

2079
02:31:22.96 --> 02:31:27.68
do something weird and get mad about it because getting mad doesn't, I'm getting mad doesn't do anything.

2080
02:31:27.68 --> 02:31:32.08
So I always try to keep my attitude positive and keep pushing forward. But thanks for having me.

2081
02:31:32.08 --> 02:31:35.52
Also, I want to thank you for having me on here. Both of you, I didn't look at you very much.

2082
02:31:35.52 --> 02:31:38.56
I'm sorry. I know we talked about this earlier, but he said not you said not to you.

2083
02:31:39.20 --> 02:31:42.32
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying not to. That's it. That's your discretion for sure.

2084
02:31:44.16 --> 02:31:49.28
I gotta redo this and it's like I look at you more. Okay, but perfect. Perfect. Yeah, man.

2085
02:31:49.28 --> 02:31:56.32
Thanks for coming on. Of course, thank you for your service to this great nation.

2086
02:31:56.32 --> 02:32:02.64
Not only is a soldier and a leader on the battlefield, but for your continued service that you're

2087
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:11.28
doing today for veterans and also for the gift that I think you give everybody that

2088
02:32:11.84 --> 02:32:20.32
here's about you or comes in contact with you in any way. And that is just a living example

2089
02:32:20.32 --> 02:32:31.84
of grit and of determination and of will. And I just think you're the absolute model of

2090
02:32:32.88 --> 02:32:42.08
what it means and what people can accomplish. If we do as you say and that is to go forward,

2091
02:32:42.08 --> 02:32:54.24
never give up, never, ever quit. Thanks for coming on, brother. Thanks for having me. And after a

2092
02:32:54.24 --> 02:33:07.52
little administrative break, Travis has left the building pretty damn awesome to have him on man.

2093
02:33:07.52 --> 02:33:16.64
Yeah. Yeah. Any and every excuse that a person might have is human being.

2094
02:33:17.76 --> 02:33:29.36
Just got destroyed. Yeah. Yeah, and he really kind of illustrated how hard it got spread the

2095
02:33:29.36 --> 02:33:34.96
time when he was like when he said, oh, I quit in the hospital. Yeah. And it's kind of like,

2096
02:33:34.96 --> 02:33:40.48
it makes just kind of when you're around them now and you see just how he is. It kind of really

2097
02:33:40.48 --> 02:33:50.40
brings to light how good he is now. Yeah. And he couldn't at that moment in time.

2098
02:33:52.24 --> 02:33:58.88
And when people get into that darkness, they don't see. They can't, they can't see the future.

2099
02:33:58.88 --> 02:34:01.84
They can't see that things are going to get better. They can't see. You know, for him at that point in

2100
02:34:01.84 --> 02:34:08.40
time, there's no way it was going to get good. Yeah. You know, so yeah, that's very true. Very true.

2101
02:34:08.40 --> 02:34:14.16
Yeah, another interesting thing is that when you see again where he's like concerned about his

2102
02:34:14.16 --> 02:34:19.68
man. And even when he said I quit, he was concerned about like his wife. Yeah. And like that was the

2103
02:34:19.68 --> 02:34:28.48
significant element. Just totally selfless person. Awesome. Well,

2104
02:34:28.48 --> 02:34:31.84
speaking of

2105
02:34:38.40 --> 02:34:45.60
being awesome. Yeah. Echo Charles. We're awesome. We think we can talk about some

2106
02:34:45.60 --> 02:34:50.72
awesome American made stuff. That's a good idea. I like where you call it this. Origin.

2107
02:34:50.72 --> 02:34:59.44
Origin. Origin. But yeah, Origin. That's the brand. So what is Origin? We're in league with origin.

2108
02:34:59.44 --> 02:35:05.60
I like the expression in league with, by the way. I might have told you that before. Yeah. It's a good

2109
02:35:05.60 --> 02:35:13.84
way of putting it. Yeah. So this is straight up the best American made apparel in the world.

2110
02:35:13.84 --> 02:35:17.92
You can, you don't have to say the best American made apparel. You can say it's the best

2111
02:35:17.92 --> 02:35:24.000
apparel in the world. And it's American made. Yeah. Is that subjective? I guess it's kind of

2112
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.32
subjective. But if you say it's the best American made. Well, I guess it all technically might be.

2113
02:35:30.32 --> 02:35:35.84
I don't know either way. It's dope. Yeah. And it's all made in America. But here's the thing about

2114
02:35:35.84 --> 02:35:41.28
made in America. I guess I don't know. I could be wrong about this part. But technically you could be like,

2115
02:35:41.28 --> 02:35:46.000
yeah, they, they sold these, I don't know, pants or whatever, you know, in America.

2116
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.20
Like, hey, where'd you get the material? Oh, well, you know, we got it from somewhere else,

2117
02:35:51.20 --> 02:35:56.72
not in America. Which I guess is cool. Technically it was made. It was crafted of, but not here.

2118
02:35:58.48 --> 02:36:04.24
So you figure what? Like, let's say you're cotton pants. Right? You get the

2119
02:36:05.20 --> 02:36:12.96
material from America. But how do you make the material? The actual cotton, where does cotton come from?

2120
02:36:12.96 --> 02:36:19.04
You grow it. I used to have a cotton like trees like a bunch of them. By the way, I'm quite none the less.

2121
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.08
So where do they get? Where does origin get that cotton? America.

2122
02:36:26.08 --> 02:36:32.80
What about the seeds to plant the cotton? They're from America. For sure. So straight up from the ground.

2123
02:36:32.80 --> 02:36:40.24
See from the earth from the seeds to the pants that you get in the event of you getting pants.

2124
02:36:40.24 --> 02:36:46.16
Yeah, the way. There's other stuff. There's geese. And now, it's a good one. The geese. If you're into

2125
02:36:46.16 --> 02:36:52.16
jujitsu, nonetheless, the pants that I got, the joggers, he was asking me, how do you like those?

2126
02:36:52.72 --> 02:36:56.96
And, you know, the new joggers, they're kind of like, they have a different shape than the old school

2127
02:36:56.96 --> 02:37:02.64
sweatpants. So I was like, okay, you know, and I looked into those. I was telling Pete this story. Where

2128
02:37:02.64 --> 02:37:10.40
I ordered some ironically from overseas. I ordered them from overseas. They looked pretty good.

2129
02:37:10.40 --> 02:37:14.96
So I ordered them. Didn't come in, by the way. This was about a year and a half ago. Still didn't come in.

2130
02:37:14.96 --> 02:37:18.40
By the way, but I looked into it. I was like, whatever. But it's probably not for me.

2131
02:37:18.40 --> 02:37:23.28
So I let it, you know, it's a sign. One of those deals either way. I get Pete's one. So I'm like,

2132
02:37:23.28 --> 02:37:30.32
all right, cool. I'm going to try these. I put them on. Surprisingly, legitimate. As far as the look goes

2133
02:37:30.32 --> 02:37:35.44
cool, it's me. Pete even said that I'm like, I look good in them, which is a lot because I just kind of met

2134
02:37:35.44 --> 02:37:42.80
Pete in person over the past week. Anyway, good stuff. Just saying it's good stuff. And again,

2135
02:37:42.80 --> 02:37:49.04
all made in America, all of it. Some keys on there, some cool rash guards. The George Washington rash

2136
02:37:49.04 --> 02:37:54.96
guard, that I feel like we're ready for that one to come back. So yeah. So Pete should, yeah,

2137
02:37:54.96 --> 02:38:02.48
you'd have that one. Yeah. Then the last origin, main.com. I want to say main. It's the state

2138
02:38:02.48 --> 02:38:07.92
main. So origin, M.A. I. Any dot com. That's a good one. The best one. Really, when it comes down

2139
02:38:07.92 --> 02:38:20.80
to it, also, jocco has some supplements. Crill oil, which we need. Enjoy more fair. So really,

2140
02:38:20.80 --> 02:38:26.72
this is like a full on like joint because Crill oil, Omega 3s for your joint. So yeah,

2141
02:38:26.72 --> 02:38:30.32
then join warfare is like, because there's a bunch of things. Regardless of what you think,

2142
02:38:30.32 --> 02:38:35.52
yeah, Crill oil joins boom good. There's more to it than that. Just like what, like glucose,

2143
02:38:35.52 --> 02:38:40.32
I mean, could it was all like, basically all the stuff that you have been taking four years.

2144
02:38:40.32 --> 02:38:44.80
Yes. You said, you know what, let me come on with my own jocco formula. Yeah, we have it now.

Boom, have it now two products right? Super Crill joint warfare. Yeah, that's the one. That's the

2147
02:38:59.28 --> 02:39:08.88
Yeah. Yeah, origin main.com. Also on it. So, you know, we've been we're on a trip right now.

2148
02:39:09.60 --> 02:39:13.04
In the event of people not knowing that we're on a trip to Maine, I didn't bring the kettle

2149
02:39:13.04 --> 02:39:18.48
wells. I thought that that might have been too much plus, you know, to check on Kelly,

2150
02:39:18.48 --> 02:39:22.80
they give you 50 pounds, right in your luggage. My kettlebell is one. You had about more than 50 pounds.

2151
02:39:22.80 --> 02:39:32.24
None the less. 88 pounds. Yeah, in your case, minus 62 in the world. Times two, 124. Boom,

2152
02:39:32.24 --> 02:39:38.80
math on point. There was a guy at the camp that we went to that brought the kettlebells. The

2153
02:39:38.80 --> 02:39:45.36
70, whatever, what in the grill on one from on it, the cool one. I didn't, I didn't work out with them.

2154
02:39:45.36 --> 02:39:54.24
I was gonna. I wanted to. I intended to. Anyway, those grill out and where we'll

2155
02:39:54.24 --> 02:39:58.88
kettlebells that I'm talking about, these are the cool kettlebells. They're from on it. Those are.

2156
02:40:01.28 --> 02:40:05.76
All kettlebells are good. Really. But if you want that level up of coolness,

2157
02:40:05.76 --> 02:40:11.04
yeah, I get those on it.com slash jockel. Get it. Jump ropes on there. The bunch of cool

2158
02:40:11.04 --> 02:40:16.88
fitness stuff. If you're lagging in your workout, which I do sometimes. I lagging my workout.

2159
02:40:16.88 --> 02:40:22.64
Not lagging like physically, but um, interest wise. You know, you get kind of bored.

2160
02:40:22.64 --> 02:40:26.88
Not you, you don't get bored. No. You just like, well, it doesn't matter. Right.

2161
02:40:26.88 --> 02:40:30.48
It doesn't even register bored or not. Yeah, execution is happening. So no, what is the

2162
02:40:30.48 --> 02:40:34.64
well, yeah. Well, some of us who get kind of bored and it's not that we're getting bored, so we're not

2163
02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:40.72
gonna do it. We're looking for something like, oh, yeah, let me try this new thing.

2164
02:40:40.72 --> 02:40:45.04
Some new hotness in regards to workouts. Can you just not say new hotness anymore?

2165
02:40:45.04 --> 02:40:48.24
High spot kind of spreads. I heard Will Smith say it. You know, one of the, one of the,

2166
02:40:48.24 --> 02:40:53.04
one of the, that was cool. It doesn't like certify it for the podcast. I know, but I figured I'd try it

2167
02:40:53.04 --> 02:40:57.84
out though. Just no. It's, it's been, it's been tried. It's been, no. Next, rejected. Oh, yeah.

2168
02:40:57.84 --> 02:41:03.12
All right. If you want some new cool stuff to do, interview our tour workout. Hey, Ben, look,

2169
02:41:03.12 --> 02:41:07.52
on it has all these one. They have battle ropes and maces and cool stuff. And they have cool

2170
02:41:07.52 --> 02:41:13.12
videos on there. By the way, don't get addicted to the website. Spin appropriate amounts of time on

2171
02:41:13.12 --> 02:41:17.20
the website, not too much. Remember how you're talking about like, you know, when you watch a video

2172
02:41:17.20 --> 02:41:23.28
on YouTube and another one pops up. Yeah. No, six of them pop up. Yeah, all formulated for you.

2173
02:41:23.28 --> 02:41:27.84
I know, especially picked. What's up for that? We're YouTube, munchkins that are like,

2174
02:41:27.84 --> 02:41:32.72
saying, I know what to call likes. Yeah. That's actually one of the street fights. That's

2175
02:41:32.72 --> 02:41:38.56
two. It's a cycle. Anyway, just watch out for that on the website on the, on the, on the, on

2176
02:41:38.56 --> 02:41:43.04
it website because the videos are real interesting. But they're about work out to the, a lot of them.

2177
02:41:43.04 --> 02:41:47.60
So it's kind of, it's kind of a catch 22. Watch a video about working out. There's not replaced

2178
02:41:47.60 --> 02:41:51.68
working out though. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. You gotta get after it for sure. But a lot of

2179
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:56.24
options on there. Anyway, on it.com slash jockel. That's the one right there. Also,

2180
02:41:57.44 --> 02:42:04.88
you know what, in this camp? So some guys came to the camp. They brought this 200 pound

2181
02:42:06.48 --> 02:42:13.36
bag of, he said it was sandbag, but it's like gravel essentially. And the challenge is

2182
02:42:15.52 --> 02:42:20.16
to pick it up over your shoulder, 200 pounds. So even that really, I mean,

2183
02:42:20.16 --> 02:42:28.32
that's not that easy 200, but the way, when they're explaining it to me, it was Mike

2184
02:42:29.12 --> 02:42:35.52
Gerard Brian Victor. They were explained to me. Well, while they're explaining it to me,

2185
02:42:36.24 --> 02:42:41.28
I'm thinking, okay, I know what a 150 pound dumbbell feels like when you lift it up.

2186
02:42:44.24 --> 02:42:48.72
And I'm thinking, could I get that? And that has a handle and balance, by the way. Something like

2187
02:42:48.72 --> 02:42:54.16
shoot could do I that I meant? I don't know if I could do that. Could I do that? And then they're like,

2188
02:42:54.16 --> 02:42:59.28
oh yeah, you know, like, I've done it. And I'm okay. So it can be done. Like, it's obviously not like

2189
02:42:59.28 --> 02:43:05.28
this thing. You need years of practice, whatever. So I was like, but man, I don't know. And then

2190
02:43:05.28 --> 02:43:09.52
sure enough. So yeah, when I went and did it, it was like, it was hard. I failed the first one.

2191
02:43:09.52 --> 02:43:14.48
I probably you bring it up. You kind of bring it onto your lap. It's 200 pounds, man. That's not like,

2192
02:43:14.48 --> 02:43:20.000
it's like, you know how you say when you when you pick up a person and they're just dead weight,

2193
02:43:21.44 --> 02:43:26.24
similar to that. Anyway, boom, failed the first time. They're cheering me on. Thanks for that,

2194
02:43:26.24 --> 02:43:30.88
by the way, guys, that helped me. And then the second time I did it, it was, it was good.

2195
02:43:31.52 --> 02:43:36.64
One of the high points. Anyway, that was just a side note. Also. Just to, so bump on to people

2196
02:43:36.64 --> 02:43:41.44
don't have to ask me, yeah, I did not participate in the challenge. I have an injured rib. That was

2197
02:43:41.44 --> 02:43:45.52
that. Yeah, you were real happy about that. You're still not happy to see it on your face, man. Yeah.

2198
02:43:47.52 --> 02:43:54.56
Yeah. So the ribs almost healed. Thanks, Andy. That was Andy. Andy did that to my ribs.

2199
02:43:54.56 --> 02:44:00.000
In a way. And this is, I think you paid a bigger price than me, but you messed up my rib in

2200
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:05.84
identical way a few months ago. Oh, you were going to get a submission on me. And then

2201
02:44:05.84 --> 02:44:11.76
you hurt yourself? No, I was trying to. I was escaping the submission. Well, essentially the same

2202
02:44:11.76 --> 02:44:16.40
situation, but instead this time you got the rib injury instead of the guy you're trying to

2203
02:44:16.40 --> 02:44:21.68
tap out. So yeah, so in a way, good for you, you know, and I hope you weave all learning something

2204
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:30.80
from this whole thing today. Anyway, also, when you buy this book and you will and should

02:45:15.52 --> 02:45:20.24
well, it's basically the way I go to describe it. It's basically the way I go to describe it.

2214
02:45:21.76 --> 02:45:25.84
Small action, big reaction. So yep. You actually very right on that one. Yes.

2215
02:45:25.84 --> 02:45:31.68
Yep. You know, I just had a feeling from the beginning that that was that's a good way to put it.

2216
02:45:31.68 --> 02:45:37.20
And it is really also. Subscribe to the podcast. It's a good way to support.

2217
02:45:38.72 --> 02:45:46.80
Stitcher iTunes. Google play all these ones that provide podcasts. This seems, you know,

2218
02:45:46.80 --> 02:45:51.60
seems like something that everyone probably has done already. But, you know, if you haven't subscribed

2219
02:45:51.60 --> 02:45:55.04
to that, that's a good one. If you're in the mood, leave a review. That's a good one.

2220
02:45:56.24 --> 02:46:00.40
Some good reviews on there already. And thank you guys for doing that. Very colorful.

2221
02:46:00.40 --> 02:46:05.36
Would you say colorful? Is that a good, is that a good, is colorful creative, creative, creative?

2222
02:46:05.36 --> 02:46:11.84
Yeah. It's good. They're fun to read from time to time. Also, YouTube, if you like the video or

2225
02:46:24.48 --> 02:46:28.56
when we upload a video. Yeah. But beyond just watching what we look like, there's other things

2226
02:46:28.56 --> 02:46:33.44
that come from the YouTube channel. Yeah. That are not on the podcast. All right. Yeah.

2227
02:46:33.44 --> 02:46:38.72
I'm subscribed. Yes. Right. So they're a little augmented videos that you make with your creative

2228
02:46:40.08 --> 02:46:46.56
spin on them. Yeah. There's just straight excerpts. Right. And then there's a deleted scenes.

2229
02:46:46.56 --> 02:46:51.60
Yeah. Deleted scenes. I think I'm put some more on there. There's a few. You know what? When you kind of

2230
02:46:51.60 --> 02:46:57.20
go through and I want, you know, when I edit it, right? So really the edit the audio editing process

2231
02:46:57.20 --> 02:47:02.56
pretty simple. You cut off the beginning. You cut off the end. You faded and you faded out.

2232
02:47:02.56 --> 02:47:10.40
Done. That's it. Easy. Yeah. But the parts that I cut off, there's some, some nuggets and

2233
02:47:10.40 --> 02:47:14.40
interesting stuff. And you know, when you're in the in the moment, I'm talking to you. It's just

2234
02:47:14.40 --> 02:47:18.40
regular, we're just talking and whatever. Maybe we're laughing maybe not. But when you kind of go back

2235
02:47:18.40 --> 02:47:23.92
and listen to it, it's kind of funny. Anyway, I'll put some of those on there too. So yeah, if you

2236
02:47:23.92 --> 02:47:28.24
subscribe to the YouTube channel, you can watch those. Those are cool. The excerpts are just kind of like,

2237
02:47:28.24 --> 02:47:34.56
you know, shareable, smaller, you know, nuggets of juggle wisdom. Which is cool. I mean, you know,

2238
02:47:34.56 --> 02:47:38.80
if you don't want to listen to the whole podcast, just for the thing. In fact, there's a couple of

2239
02:47:38.80 --> 02:47:42.40
people who were there like, yeah, I listened to those. They, the guy had to camp. He was like, yeah,

2240
02:47:42.40 --> 02:47:46.80
I listened to those excerpts. I almost every day. Yeah. Because they're like, yeah, there's a lot of

2241
02:47:46.80 --> 02:47:55.76
them there now, too. By the way, also juggle as a store. It's called juggle store. Juggle store.com. There's

2242
02:47:55.76 --> 02:48:02.40
some shirts on there. If you want to support. So I'm not saying by sure. I'm not saying by a hat,

2243
02:48:02.80 --> 02:48:07.84
got hats on there now. Snap back snap back. My bad. I thought they were. Heck, like,

2244
02:48:07.84 --> 02:48:12.24
those were, you know, I go thought it was FlexFit. Trucker hats. They're an exist. Yeah, they don't.

2245
02:48:12.24 --> 02:48:16.64
Doesn't have those in the world. Doesn't need them. Yeah. It almost doesn't make sense. Yeah.

2246
02:48:16.64 --> 02:48:21.28
Oh, maybe. I don't know. I've for real thought they're FlexFit. But you know what? I looked into it.

2247
02:48:21.28 --> 02:48:27.52
And I realized that the reason that I thought they're FlexFit is because some new hats,

2248
02:48:27.52 --> 02:48:33.28
some coming out with. Oh, maybe in a few weeks, they're like, they're a different style of hat

2249
02:48:33.28 --> 02:48:39.20
and their FlexFit. They look dope, too, by the way. I'll show them to you one day. Cool. So yeah,

2250
02:48:39.20 --> 02:48:43.60
I'm not saying, hey, I'm not saying, hey, by a shirt, by a rashguard or whatever, I'm saying,

2251
02:48:43.60 --> 02:48:51.60
go on the store. Juggle store. Look on there. Check out the items. If you like something,

2252
02:48:52.48 --> 02:48:58.000
get something. Somewhere, these on there, some women's dust on patches, which are cool. I've seen a

2253
02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:02.08
few of those. When people's backpack's actually look kind of dope, I'm going to probably put

2254
02:49:02.08 --> 02:49:07.44
one on my backpack. And you know, I'm just letting us all know. I'm about to, you know,

2255
02:49:07.44 --> 02:49:10.72
sometimes you just think, think about loud. Definitely. I'm curious about that.

2256
02:49:11.68 --> 02:49:16.000
Well, I'll be looking forward to you. Yeah. Yeah. I'll show it to you. And it's done. Anyway,

2257
02:49:17.12 --> 02:49:22.32
Juggle store.com. That's a good way. Also psychological warfare. Who are we just talking to that

2258
02:49:22.32 --> 02:49:30.88
OP? Yeah. Where? Okay. Basically, psychological warfare. What is that? It is in album with tracks,

2259
02:49:32.08 --> 02:49:39.04
Juggle tracks, where in your campaign against weakness, meaning if you have goals. Like,

2260
02:49:39.04 --> 02:49:47.28
okay, so I'll listen to Jordan Peterson. And he kind of, he has this thing. I'm not going to go

2261
02:49:47.28 --> 02:49:50.88
it like too much into it. But he has this thing where he's like, okay, why don't why don't people

2262
02:49:50.88 --> 02:49:55.28
get what they want? And so because in one of the reasons is because they just don't know what that is.

2263
02:49:55.28 --> 02:49:58.88
And we kind of don't. Even if you say, I want to get better, better in what?

2264
02:49:58.88 --> 02:50:02.56
Judging sir. Because you can do one push-up a day and you're technically better.

2265
02:50:03.20 --> 02:50:08.000
Technically. So it's like, what do you mean better? Better how, whatever, so anyway,

2266
02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.56
back to the psychological. If you want to, I don't know, lose weight. You know, wake up earlier and

2267
02:50:12.56 --> 02:50:17.04
be more disciplined in these specific ways and all this stuff. You want to clean up your diet.

2268
02:50:17.04 --> 02:50:20.16
To clean up your diet, you've got to avoid junk food, all this stuff. junk food, you need to

2269
02:50:20.16 --> 02:50:26.80
get distracted by short-term payoffs, right? With junk food. Because junk, the whole idea of

2270
02:50:26.80 --> 02:50:32.40
junk food is short-term payoffs over long-term payoffs. Good diet, long-term payoffs. Bad diet,

2271
02:50:32.40 --> 02:50:39.60
short-term payoffs. Anyway, if you get tempted by weakness, you listen to the psychological

2272
02:50:39.60 --> 02:50:44.08
warfare album or just a track of whatever. So look, you're waking up early in the morning,

2273
02:50:44.08 --> 02:50:49.20
the 430 every day. That's what I'm doing from now on. That one day when you're kind of tired.

2274
02:50:50.32 --> 02:50:57.36
And the alarm goes off and you're tempted or compelled to press the snooze or just stay in bed.

2275
02:50:57.36 --> 02:51:03.44
I'll wake up later. Oh wake up at noon. Just saying something. Wake up at noon sometimes.

2276
02:51:04.56 --> 02:51:09.76
Play this track called get up and get after it. I guarantee you won't wake up at noon. You'll

2277
02:51:09.76 --> 02:51:18.24
wake up at the assigned time. Assign by yourself by the way. 100% success rate on that. If you fail,

2278
02:51:18.24 --> 02:51:23.04
if you listen to this and you fail at your little thing, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to say.

2279
02:51:23.68 --> 02:51:27.60
But that's a good one. Psychological warfare. Joccal will link. Look for it. Look into it.

2280
02:51:28.40 --> 02:51:32.88
Also, you get some joccal white tea. You can get that on Amazon. It'll make you be able to

2281
02:51:32.88 --> 02:51:39.84
do amazing feet to strengthen with no effort barely at all. Yeah, like the rock bag. Yeah,

2282
02:51:39.84 --> 02:51:42.80
the yellow jocquite tea boom. You nailed it. Easy money. One hand.

2283
02:51:44.72 --> 02:51:50.000
Books like echo said tough as they come by Travis Mills. You can get that. You can also

2284
02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:55.52
get a book called Extreme Ownership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin. It's about combat leadership.

2285
02:51:55.52 --> 02:52:00.72
Way of the warrior kid. If you want your kid or a kid that you know to be stronger, smarter,

2286
02:52:00.72 --> 02:52:08.16
healthier and therefore, because they're stronger, smarter and healthier, they're also more confident.

2287
02:52:09.20 --> 02:52:13.20
If you want to do that for a kid, get them book called Way of the Warrior Kid.

2288
02:52:15.68 --> 02:52:25.04
Then you can also get the discipline equals freedom field manual. It got a little bump the other

2289
02:52:25.04 --> 02:52:28.88
day. I don't know. I think like in social media, I put something out and got a little bump

2290
02:52:28.88 --> 02:52:34.64
and all of a sudden the delivery dates of people that just ordered it got pushed back. So I don't

2291
02:52:34.64 --> 02:52:40.88
know, I don't know specifically like what that means, but I tell you this, it means you just order it

2292
02:52:40.88 --> 02:52:45.28
now. If you want to get it when it comes out order it, if you want that first edition copy,

2293
02:52:45.28 --> 02:52:51.92
which is pretty much what you want. If you need leadership in your world, which you probably do,

2294
02:52:51.92 --> 02:52:58.16
because that's the way things get done is through leadership and you need help in that department.

2295
02:52:58.16 --> 02:53:04.72
You can contact our leadership consulting company, echelon front. It's me. It's LaFab and

2296
02:53:04.72 --> 02:53:12.48
JP to know Dave Burke. You can email us at info at echelonfront.com if you want us to come speak

2297
02:53:12.48 --> 02:53:18.16
or work with your company. That's what you do. And finally, and this is the master.

2298
02:53:19.20 --> 02:53:25.84
We are close to selling it out right now. The one that's in San Diego September 14th and 15th,

2299
02:53:25.84 --> 02:53:31.92
leadership tactics, techniques and procedures for business and life get better at everything,

2300
02:53:33.04 --> 02:53:38.16
get registered. Do it now before it sells out. It might even be sold out by the time this podcast

2301
02:53:38.16 --> 02:53:42.56
comes out. But check it out. See if you can find it. See if you can get there.

2302
02:53:42.56 --> 02:53:49.92
ExtremeLaryship.com and until the master, if you do need to communicate with us, we're actually cruising

2303
02:53:49.92 --> 02:54:02.16
on the interwebs Twitter, Instagram and also defaceable people. Echoes at echeloncharrals and

2304
02:54:02.16 --> 02:54:12.88
I am at Jocca-Willink and to all the military members out there that are holding the line.

2305
02:54:12.88 --> 02:54:20.88
Thank you and to those veterans that stood the watch, especially those that were wounded.

2306
02:54:23.20 --> 02:54:33.76
Thank you for giving us our freedom and to police law enforcement firefighters, EMTs and other

2307
02:54:33.76 --> 02:54:42.32
first responders. Thank you for your service. And thank you for keeping us protected from man

2308
02:54:42.32 --> 02:54:52.40
and from nature here at home. And to everyone else out there facing struggles and facing hard times.

2309
02:54:54.32 --> 02:55:04.40
Remember, remember the challenges that Travis Mills faced and still faces.

2310
02:55:04.40 --> 02:55:15.68
And he faces those incredible challenges every minute of every day. And he does that with

2311
02:55:15.68 --> 02:55:30.08
tenacity and positivity and proves without question. That if you never quit and you never give up

2312
02:55:30.08 --> 02:55:37.52
and you keep moving forward, then nothing can stop you from getting after it.

2313
02:55:37.52 --> 02:55:48.64
So, until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
