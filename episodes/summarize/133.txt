I didn't want to get my clothes dirty from him I wanted to look sharp he went down as far as the operating table but didn't want to lie down a nurse using broken chinese told him we're using ether it won't hurt so lie down she gave me a rise smile when she said that she had been working there for a long time and when I happened to meet her again much later and asked her about it she didn't remember she was handling so many vivis sections it was routine people who repeat evil acts do not remember them there is no sense of wrongdoing war means this also war is not just shooting in order for Japan to win all the chinese were made prisoners women's bellies were cut open homes were burned if you couldn't do this then you weren't a loyal soldier of the emperor even if one despises an act one must bear it from there a person becomes accustomed to it we all received practiced it was normal to smile at this the crimes committed during our aggressive wars are forgotten gone from memory at the time they were considered right so the surgery began the man was given ether and dissected his appendix was so small that it was like looking for a burling worm I had to cut and search repeatedly the blood flow was stopped nerves were cut bones were cut with a saw and a tracheotomy was performed blood and air escape from his body the blood came foaming up practice time was two hours the man died and his body was thrown into a hole and buried that was my first crime after that it was easy eventually I dissected 14 chinese I also saw vivis sections once I saw about 40 doctors gathered there was a man bound and squatting the guard asked the doctors are you ready and the prisoner was laid out without anesthetic two cuts were made down as belly the victim made a few gas the dissection was a botch and he died soon I saw four people dissected that way it is said that there are that there were 20 million victims of the war in China but only 10 to 20% of these were killed in gunfire exchange most non-resisting old people women and children were captured and slaughtered prisoners of war could not be taken to the front or allowed to escape so they were killed in the manner of the rape of NAN King those who were a part of it do not come forward to tell the people how it was why because the Japanese have forgotten all about it everybody's forgotten they did things and got medals and they don't think they did anything worse than kicking a dog they weren't bothered because they never considered a dreadful thing to take a scalpel and cut open a living person and this will be the last piece of testimony that I read and this was a soldier that was attached to unit 731 named O'Hara Takiyoshi and he said I joined the cavalry from my home in 1939 in April of that year I was stationed in northeast China then in March 1942 I was transferred to unit 731 I did not know anything about that unit my first duty was taken care of domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, horses and cows I assisted in researching the diseases that affect these animals I saw tests in which Maruta were tied to crosses in a large circle as planes flew over and dropped bacteriological bombs in the area surrounded by the crosses their legs were chained and their bodies tied tightly we observed the tests from a distance of about 200 meters I had the job of cleaning up and disinfecting after the experiments and gathering to bring lying around I want people who come to this exhibition to tell their children and grandchildren that there is nothing more stupid and fearful then more nothing more stupid and fearful then more and I think that's a good quote to end this except for it is wrong it is wrong because as stupid and as fearful and as reprehensible as war is there is something worse than war and that is allowing this kind of evil to exist as bad as war is and war is awful war is hell and I have said that over and over again as have many others but there are worse things than war things like unit 731 things like the Nazi concentration camps things like the rape of Nand King there are things that are worse than war and there are times when war is not only justified but it is a moral obligation and I do not say that lightly but when evil and when darkness and when malevolent and demonic spirits rise to power they must be stopped in the responsibility for that lies within all of us every day to do our best to do our best to move the world away from the darkness and the demons that linger inside men's minds and move the world toward the light and toward what is good okay we drop the atomic bombs this just kind of makes that a close deal in my mind you know you got people that are trying to they got enough enough biological weapon treated in fact half the world so and again jumping forward in this book get the book so that you can get the whole story but there's a massive infestigation that takes place to find out what's going on there's little leeks they they catch wind of little bit of it but not a lot of it and at one point there interrogating ishi and here's ishi did not any involvement our work was to protect soldiers he said did anyone else concerned themselves with biological warfare against crop plants I do not know replied ishi his interrogator made no effort to pursue the matter Thompson of veterinarian by training turned the questions of biological warfare against animals we did not do any experiments on large large animals said ishi we used small animals as test animals besides we had no veterinarians what field tests were made with the plague organism he asked due to the danger of it there were no field experiments with that organism there were great many field mice in menturia and it would have been dangerous to conduct field experiments with plague because the field mice would very easily carry the organism since started an epidemic we conducted the experiments with plague in the laboratory said ishi what kind of experiments Thompson acquired we put rats and cages inside the room and sprayed the whole room with plague bacteria this was to determine how the rats became infected whether through the eyes knows mouth or through the skin what did you find out the test results were not too favorable we usually got 10% infection by which way that was the total said ishi misunderstanding the question what route was most effective Thompson repeated through the nose said ishi also through an open wound so they're interrogating he's been pretty he's lying he's covering up but there's there's a twist that we're going to see unfold here and I'll explain it a little bit so it makes sense as it comes forth the twist in this story is that the cold war was about to start the cold war was now starting and America these experiments that had taken place and knowledge had been gained through this through these evil experiments well and I'll catch myself doing and it'll take along as I don't know like brother it's not even necessary and in fact and some people they will bring up this point which is a good point where I put stuff commonly right for okay warpath or take warpath for example I put the walls crumbling in Jacoen Dean rolling and when they when they clash like the walls come chattering down it's all these special effects which is like cool when you look at but all the special effects the sound effects and like all this stuff is like is it kind of getting in the way of the message because the message is like you're saying something specific you know but I'll give a brief synopsis of it one of the problems is if you charge someone with war crimes and you put them on trial well you've got to say with their own what the war crimes are that they committed and if you say that the war crimes were committed were these experiments with chemical and biological weapons then people are going to know what the results of the experiments were and that means the knowledge is going to be out there and the knowledge could fall into the hands of people that we were now looking to be facing in another war which ended up being the cold war luckily not a full war so that's how this that's how this story continues to unfold back to the book there's no question that is an individual and many of the associates were guilty of serious war crimes as lieutenant general ishi was unissue undoubtably possessed sufficient high military rank to be classified as a class a war criminal he was the top of the tree in his own field his actions as the head of unit 731 qualified him as a criminal on many accounts not only was biological warfare considered extra legal by most countries but issue is also guilty of outrageous conventional war crimes he had carried out calculated human experimentations on prisoners of war a conventional war crime that had long been prescribed in the manials of military law of every major power he'd carried out similar research against innocent civilians clearly a crime against humanity. and that's how you can put someone like yeeshie that goes through all that and still remains loyal even after defeat still remains loyal to the deposed emperor and here's an army doctor named uosah Ken this is not easy for me to speak about but it is something I must confess what I did was wrong it is also true that it was forced on me by the government but that does not reduce the size of my crime it is something that happened a long time ago but those who are not taught about the war are ill-educated the Japanese army went to plunder and steel materials and to kill Japan wanted iron, coal and provisions and the army drove into the mountains to prosecute the war at the time the Japanese used derogatory terms for the chinese like chinamen and chink and looked at them with contempt when I was a child we were told to despise the chinese despise the Koreans it's all right to conquer them we have become elite and should join with the Americans in British and conquer Asia I hated war and killing but around middle school and into college I began to think that such ideas were unavoidable people were driven into a life which human qualities in which human qualities were lost the soldiers outlet for frustrations was the brothel of the comfort women any means was resorted to in order to raise one's rank and keep up the authority of the country and in the army hospital we practiced vivis section living persons are good for the scalpel practice so people were brought in one day soon after I started at the assignment the hospital had told us today we will have surgery practice I was startled it was an order there was no getting out of it normally we dissected people who had died of such diseases as typhoid fever, dysentery and tuberculosis now we were being taken to the section room for a different type of exercise soldiers came along as observers everything started with a signal from the hospital head one chinese had big thighs and walk slowly and calmly he laid down and had no sign of fear no stress on his face he was composed someone else used him for surgery practice I went over and pushed the other one onto the operating table I had no feeling of apology or of doing anything bad the farmer was resigned to his fate and I quote interesting choice of music for this that's it now I also will say that I don't 100% trust myself like I think to myself well echo really liked Christmas music so he put it in there so that's fine if that maybe some other people will like it too and that's I'm not here to like dictate what people like and don't like I'm just here to tell you what I like and don't like Kobe the city went to his second wife had come mitzuo who wants to provide the the unit's animal house outlived his younger brother shiro but was unable to work after the war and lived on money gained by selling his country property mitzuo and tecao and their eldest brother torael who had been killed in the ruso japanese war during japan's major period are buried in the ishi family cemetery at cameo on august 17th 1958 13 years after the end of the war in the back room of a stone mason shop near tomah cemetery stokeo ishi made his first and apparently only post war appearance before assembled at junior members of his former unit he reminisced about the early days of unit 731 in a speech reportedly still rich in xenophobia and elitism he she described how his unit was to have been the salvation of japan a country then encircled by the west scientifically impoverished yet spiritually rich he apologized for their suffering since the end of the war but urged his audience to remain proud of the memory of unit 731 and here's a little part of his what he said it was in order that we could have precious human material that the unit 731 was set for the saving of the nation national circumstances were not permitting unfortunately we did not achieve our aims so even after all that even after all that even looking back after 13 years after the end of the war he's looking back and and still has the same mindset and that meant how could he's hard to understand and I want to shed a little bit of light on that mentality and do that through some personal accounts of what happened at unit 731 but again those sentences don't include ishi or the other main players at units 731 because they got kind of protected not even kind of they got protected by America and exchange for their information sort of in response to everything that was going on there on December 27th 1941 the following story appeared in the New York Times date land Tokyo no knowledge MacArthur says general darkless MacArthur's headquarters said today there were no known cases in which Japanese used American prisoners in jernmore for experiments the headquarters added that the Japanese had done some experiments with animals although there was no evidence they had ever used human beings as far as it is known here no American's held prisoner by the Japanese that mook didn't ever accuse their captors of having used them as guinea pigs in biological warfare tests so that's all not true that's all not true back to the book to this day Russia has allowed itself to bask in feelings of moral superiority over America and not without some justification in respect of the way it brought its unit 731 criminals to justice so just that's the way it flushed out now this you might think that's a little disturbing this is equally disturbing this just horrible back to the book after the war most of the scientists of unit 731 prospered much is explained by the clear complicity on the part of the United States authorities in the war crimes of unit 731 the detachments civilian researchers and other associated scientists were quite free to return to academia and it goes through this lit this multiple page list of of guys that went on to work at the research institute for natural resources chief so it continues and open back to the book and it opened admission about human experimentation allegations about the the use of biological warfare even hints about the connection between unit 731 and a member of the Japanese imperial family were all contained in the files of legal sections case 330 by the middle of 1947 how did this come about and why was nothing be done being done about the files contents so this is getting shut down that's what's happening now here's the sort of the more official opinion back to the book on balance the subcommittee felt it was desirable to avoid a war crimes prosecution and here's what they said since it is believed that the USSR possesses only a small portion of this technical information and since any war crimes trial would completely reveal such data to all nations it is felt that such publicity must be avoided in interests of defense and the security of the United States it is believed it is believed also that war crimes prosecution of eshi and his associates would serve to stop the flow of much additional information of a technical and scientific nature it is felt that the use of this information as a basis for war crimes evidence would be a grave detriment to Japanese cooperation with the United States occupation forces in Japan so there you hear the decisions getting made and that's the way it went and in the end going back to the book no member of unit 731 was called before any British or American military tribunal to account for war crimes none of them well actually not by any British or Americans because the Russians they still went after and they and when they went after them and they got some of them they made America look bad they had a big trial and here's the the state council the state council's name was smear off but it was just this weird stiffness that sort of just like I couldn't straighten it out right away when I wake up you know I can't like you know I kind of got to work it out and it slowly just started to just stiffen up a little more and here's the thing I was way less active on it too where because when I do like pushups and stuff where I'm using my elbow a lot it would be kind of stiff that night you know than the next thing you do stuff but if they're doing good work scientifically and for you know medical schools and stuff like this is obviously they're teaching people they're probably you know making breakthroughs and you know discoveries in the field and stuff that's gonna help people in general you know now here's the other way I'm gonna frame it for you is from the eyes of that mother who's in that gas chamber who's watching that switch get turned and she knows it's gonna kill her and her child and there's no there's no redemption zero check good job trying to lighten up the mood over here you're all you and you know another guy was chief research section at a pharmaceutical company doctor ishi kawa once a pathologist at unit 731 who had brought home within thousands of human pathological samples became a professor at at a university in 1944 a position he held throughout the 1960s and 70s he eventually became president of the university's medical school the local newspaper once planned to award him with a metal for his contribution to society but after students who knew of his wartime record objected the war was canceled so these guys carried on another guy professor of show a university from a ecological another professor of bacteriologically a Kyoto university the list goes on on and on doctor he sought to Yoshimura who directed unit 731's frostbite experiments literally freezing people the death became a faculty member at the Kyoto perfectural medical college in the 1950s and later it's president and like i said that list goes on and on and of course he still haven't heard about ishi yet the mastermind behind this whole thing here we go back to the book ishi inherited much of the family's property in cameo village because if you remember cameo villages where they bring all these prison guards from their home village so that they'd get the complete loyalty from them so he inherited much of the properties family the family property in cameo village is to elder brothers tecao and mitzuo were childless unlike shiro who fathered six children tecao unit 731 special prison squad leader eventually died of liver cancer and and and then it starts to come up and sure enough out she comes like a like a beast she's going to hold the rock and she comes about the water aww how we do it powered through that and brings the rock up drops it at my feet now it's like victory is yours that's that's actually pretty powerful because bro when you're I mean unless she was like defense under mindset so her she was probably like I'm not gonna let this rock defeat me I'm gonna bring it to the other side and that's kind of the mindset Tanaka's flee factory was expanded and given more staff with 4,500 flee breeding machines and operation 100 million insects could be produced every few days Ishi plant a breed 300 kilograms approximately one billion plague flees in the run-up to war Special training courses in flee breeding were set up at ping-fain and June and subunit members ordered back afterwards to establish their own production bases To propagate plague cultures and to feed the flees rats were needed in their thousands Yamada ordered every land unit of the Quantang Quantang army to trap rats Kaurasau is new conveyor system and again I'm throwing names in here that are explained with a lot more detail in the book that's why you buy the book and read the book so you can get the full picture Kaurasau is new conveyor system was working around the clock producing plague, typhoid, cholera and and throx organisms which were sufficient if correctly dispersed to in fact half the planet between midnight and 1 a.m. on the morning of August 9th after Hiroshima had been devastated by the atomic bomb the Soviet army swept across the border into Venturia and Korea with a massive force of 1.5 million men 5,500 tanks and 5,000 airplanes the Quantang army was thrown into panic confusion broke loose that day or the day after Yamada ordered the destruction of units 731 and 100 again 731 we've been talking about 100 who was another one of these parallel units that was doing the same type of stuff a nearby sapper unit was ordered to blow up ping-fain's main headquarters the units personnel were to destroy all evidence and be evacuated to sell Seoul in Korea a second bomb was yet to be dropped on the Nagasaki so here the war is obviously turning we dropped the bomb and they go to cover their tracks they've completely destroyed everything destroy the buildings destroy all the records destroy everything and when I say everything I mean everything here we go back to the book at ping-fain marutes were the first to be destroyed members of the five 16 chemical warfare unit gas the marutes by throwing flasks of toxic chemicals into their cells 600 local mentoring and Chinese laborers who worked at the Yagasawa plant disease farm and elsewhere at ping-fang were machine gun potassium cyanide poison was also put into the marute is breakfast food but so here's the more questions so does is it did they make up even a little bit further crime by doing good in the future even though they didn't get punished like did they make up for it or is it more of a crime because they got to do good stuff they got to get awards and they got to be prosecuted in the prosperous and they shouldn't the end either what if you look at it from the perspective of like hey let's look at them hold it so there's there's there's two ways I'm gonna stage this for you look at it holistically from like and here we go perhaps there are some people here and and by the way most of these accounts are from an exhibition that went around Japan kind of explaining what happened and people would come to this exhibition and they would capture if someone was involved in unit 731 or someone remembered or someone had a story about it they would capture their account and that's what this book has a lot of from this ex but this exhibition that they did I think it was in the mid 1990s that they did this exhibition so this particular person that was showed up at this exhibition he was a captain the Japanese army his name is Kojima te kaio and here's what he said perhaps there are some people here at this unit 731 exhibition who think that this was all there was to jippit japanese aggression at the time unit 731 was merely one segment of the dark shadow of Japan's aggression and I would like to tell of my experience in this so something okay low for bread like like maybe a small low for bread that's the max right that any of these kids are grabbing my daughter grab something that's like the size of a like a legit watermelon like a big giant giant giant rock a two hand and now it gets worse Back to the book perhaps the greatest horror of unit 731 was Viva section Unit 731 had two teams of pathologists One headed by doctor akamoto the other by doctor esicawa Anatomical study performed by these squads was not always confined to the dead Pathology squad assistant Kirum zawa saw vivis sections Unit 731 did work on living human bodies he said To do this work our sentiments were suppressed So this is a whole new level we're actually dissecting or vivisecting people that are alive Back to the book some doctors are said do have come all the way from Japan just to see such a dissection Laboratory assistants got extra pay Called the chemical weapons allowance for wielding the scaffold during this dreadful work Blood is said often to have spurred all over the ceiling of the dissection room as certain Insisions were made limbs of the dying maruitas would flex and jerk involuntary in voluntarily as the scalpel entered particular parts of the brain Organs would twitch vigorously after they were thrown into jars Of formalin for preservation Not only were anesthetics researched, but also bizarre surgical experiments Connecting different parts of the body are reported to have been performed and it says good one of them maybe one two I don't know anyway go there jacco store dot com if you like something get something you want to represent in your town also rash guards on there who do you's on there t-shirt rash guards trucker's hats you like the flex fit like say like no where hats which is where it was your bald so they're just trying to like I said destroy everything and make it like it didn't happen and as they wrap this up the rest of unit 731 expecting a few left behind for final clearing up assembled on the 13th and 14th at the shunting yard each he made a formal speech extoling the memory of unit 731 and its diligent research as if in mockery of him it was interrupted by the sound of a prison exploding members were issued vials of poison he she had originally wished every branch member and all families in togo village to commit suicide with this proposal this proposal was met met the violent disagreement of major general kikuchi 731's research chief nonetheless some took their lives without orders from ishi three thought they should all kill themselves got a little resistance there I would I would have thought that kikuchi perhaps would have provided more resistance against the behavior that they were occurring to you not just to you just want to protect himself here at the end okay we're gonna do this we're gonna record this and we're gonna do that you know it's just like I'm gonna try to make a fun video out of it and then just put some random like graphics on there that was just having fun doing so these videos you do it they're kind of done out of just fun you know and you know what speaking of this I was thinking about this because another really dark book that we covered on here was ordinary men which ordinary men talked about the the police the the Nazi police that went from being normal guys that were middle aged hadn't been indoctrinated in the Nazi way of life as children they got kind of like swept along with the rest of the Germans and they ended up committing these heinous acts and murdering thousands and thousands of of Jews but what's interesting about that so in that story it's normal guys going evil in this story these evil guys that did evil things they come out the other side and kind of like go normal and I think this is why I pulled this one specifically because this talks about where this came from where this mentality came from that issue had to the end we were born and raised in a society of emperorsum a person's absolute responsibility above the army and government was to the emperor the emperor was a living deity the emperor's command was supreme and controlled the entire country we were told how we must serve the emperor how we should behave toward our parents how should we we should behave toward our teachers and how should we should behave toward our siblings we were taught that Japan is a sacred country that the people of Japan are a superior race that the people of china korea south east Asia and Russia were all inferior races and the superior race must govern them and by doing so we would bring them happiness this was the cause to which Japan must devote itself he goes on again I'm not reading the entire thing but you have to get the book to get these entire accounts soon after we went into service we were given training to get our courage up we were ordered to watch beheadings chinese were made to sit by a hole in the ground and the season soldiers would cut their heads off blood spurred up from the neck into the air and the bodies would roll into the holes then we had bayonet practice victims had their hands tied behind them around a tree and were used as bayonet targets we had to watch this as part of our training this was a shock to me and for two or three days food would not pass through my throat but two years later I became an officer in charge of a platoon and with about 25 men under me later I became a company commander with a hundred and fifty one men and that meant that if I didn't build a strong platoon and a strong company I would fall behind and so I too tested the courage of the soldiers under me by using chinese prisoners this was normal training in the Japanese army when we were not involved in major operations we would go out into our own immediate area on continuous three-day operations to see if there were any enemy around on such occasions we stole tortured and slaughtered people the chinese had a saying about us that Japan had a three-way complete policy burned completely killed completely and pillaged completely yet when we were doing those things we had no sense of guilt or of doing anything wrong it was for the emperor for the country so that's how the rest
