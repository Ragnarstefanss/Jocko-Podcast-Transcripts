00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.66
This is Jockel Podcast number 143.

2
00:00:03.66 --> 00:00:06.40
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.40 --> 00:00:07.36
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.36 --> 00:00:08.20
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.76 --> 00:00:14.04
War is never what we think it is.

6
00:00:15.24 --> 00:00:19.94
It is butchery, stupidity and hate.

7
00:00:21.32 --> 00:00:23.48
It is 90% boredom.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.16
It can be horrible.

9
00:00:27.16 --> 00:00:30.16
Beyond anything you have ever imagined.

10
00:00:31.16 --> 00:00:38.16
It can also be ludicrous and absurd and technologically refined.

11
00:00:40.16 --> 00:00:47.16
Tragedically, its lessons are always forgotten only to be refought on still another battlefield.

12
00:00:49.16 --> 00:00:53.16
The Vietnam War was our first real media war.

13
00:00:53.16 --> 00:01:03.16
Spanning the globe in outraged unreality, bringing video taped death and destruction into countless homes,

14
00:01:03.16 --> 00:01:07.16
fermenting protests and political justifications.

15
00:01:09.16 --> 00:01:15.16
Effecting the world's generation, it shattered our dreams of abstract morality.

16
00:01:15.16 --> 00:01:23.16
And in horrible reality reeducated our youth to a third world of suffering they had never known.

17
00:01:23.16 --> 00:01:28.16
And had now felt deep within their own countries worldwide.

18
00:01:30.16 --> 00:01:33.16
Vietnam was a symbol of the times.

19
00:01:34.16 --> 00:01:38.16
The best of hopes turned inside out a fear of no return.

20
00:01:38.16 --> 00:01:45.16
But for me and many others the Vietnam War was much more.

21
00:01:46.16 --> 00:01:52.16
It was in a moment our survival and death.

22
00:01:53.16 --> 00:01:59.16
In primitive sophistication our destruction and rebirth.

23
00:01:59.16 --> 00:02:08.16
It was in short a long imprisoned cry of what we all were not.

24
00:02:09.16 --> 00:02:15.16
This is a diary I kept while I was in Vietnam.

25
00:02:17.16 --> 00:02:22.16
It is for the most part unstructured as many of us were.

26
00:02:23.16 --> 00:02:25.16
But all of it is true.

27
00:02:25.16 --> 00:02:32.16
History someone once said is trying to tell the truth through the most acceptable lie.

28
00:02:33.16 --> 00:02:36.16
But this book is not about history.

29
00:02:37.16 --> 00:02:41.16
It only tells the truth as far as one person felt it.

30
00:02:42.16 --> 00:02:49.16
A frozen spark of time embracing one American soldier in a southeast Asian war.

31
00:02:49.16 --> 00:02:52.16
Or.

32
00:02:54.16 --> 00:03:00.16
And that right there is the introduction of a book.

33
00:03:01.16 --> 00:03:02.16
It's a diary.

34
00:03:03.16 --> 00:03:07.16
And it's written by a guy by the name of Peter Nash Swisher.

35
00:03:08.16 --> 00:03:12.16
A man that was born in Oxford, England.

36
00:03:12.16 --> 00:03:20.16
His dad was actually in the second world war and was killed coming home after the war.

37
00:03:21.16 --> 00:03:26.16
And his mom eventually moved to Canada and then remarried to an American.

38
00:03:27.16 --> 00:03:35.16
And Peter was adopted by that American father and grew up in Fort Aconston, Wisconsin and Louisville, Kentucky.

39
00:03:36.16 --> 00:03:37.16
That's where he grew up.

40
00:03:37.16 --> 00:03:41.16
That's where he graduated high school and he got his degree in American history.

41
00:03:42.16 --> 00:03:50.16
In 1966 from Amherst College and he got his masters from Stanford in 1967.

42
00:03:52.16 --> 00:03:57.16
And in 1968 he was drafted into the army.

43
00:03:58.16 --> 00:04:00.16
He went to OCS November that same year.

44
00:04:00.16 --> 00:04:07.16
And by 1969 he was doing his tour in Vietnam.

45
00:04:09.16 --> 00:04:15.16
And he definitely has a gift for writing.

46
00:04:16.16 --> 00:04:25.16
And luckily he left a little bit of that gift to be shared with us in this book of his,

47
00:04:25.16 --> 00:04:29.16
which is called a Vietnam diary.

48
00:04:32.16 --> 00:04:35.16
And let's go to the book.

49
00:04:36.16 --> 00:04:38.16
He starts off with a little prologue.

50
00:04:39.16 --> 00:04:42.16
He's got some quotes in there and I pulled out one of the quotes from the prologue.

51
00:04:43.16 --> 00:04:48.16
It says the ultimate explanation of Vietnam must come from those involved there.

52
00:04:48.16 --> 00:04:55.16
And observer even when blood splatters his clothes remains outside.

53
00:04:56.16 --> 00:05:05.16
The basic experience of Vietnam is to be bound to stay in that war for a year or until wounded or killed.

54
00:05:07.16 --> 00:05:10.16
No reporter can impose this shackle on himself.

55
00:05:11.16 --> 00:05:14.16
He is like a doctor in an asylum.

56
00:05:14.16 --> 00:05:17.16
He can report with compassion and empathy.

57
00:05:18.16 --> 00:05:20.16
He can understand a great deal.

58
00:05:21.16 --> 00:05:28.16
But the final truth remains with those who must exist in madness or in the combat of their war.

59
00:05:30.16 --> 00:05:35.16
And that's actually a quote that he pulled from a guy named Arthur T. Hadley who is a war correspondent.

60
00:05:36.16 --> 00:05:40.16
And that's very accurate. There's a huge difference between someone that's reporting the war.

61
00:05:40.16 --> 00:05:44.16
Even though they're there and you've seen the war reporters that are right next to the infantrymen.

62
00:05:45.16 --> 00:05:47.16
Sometimes they're even carrying weapons.

63
00:05:48.16 --> 00:05:51.16
But there's a key component that is that those guys can leave if they want to.

64
00:05:52.16 --> 00:05:54.16
And those soldiers cannot.

65
00:05:55.16 --> 00:05:56.16
They're going to have to do their year.

66
00:05:57.16 --> 00:05:59.16
And that's the way it works and that's a huge difference.

67
00:06:00.16 --> 00:06:01.16
Psychological, huge difference.

68
00:06:04.16 --> 00:06:06.16
And a real difference of reality.

69
00:06:06.16 --> 00:06:11.16
And so that the diary starts off November 20th, 1967.

70
00:06:12.16 --> 00:06:15.16
He's going through basic training and fordix new jersey.

71
00:06:17.16 --> 00:06:20.16
Pulled a little couple, a little section out of that.

72
00:06:21.16 --> 00:06:23.16
What's the spirit of the bayonet? To kill.

73
00:06:24.16 --> 00:06:26.16
What's the spirit of the bayonet? To kill.

74
00:06:27.16 --> 00:06:32.16
Sergeant H. And he refers everyone here just by the first letter of their last name.

75
00:06:32.16 --> 00:06:36.16
Sergeant H was our third instructor, another airborne veteran.

76
00:06:37.16 --> 00:06:41.16
And one of the two survivors in his Vietnam company who came back alive.

77
00:06:42.16 --> 00:06:49.16
Once when his weapon jammed in combat, he had killed two veat con with his bayonet and his rifle bat.

78
00:06:50.16 --> 00:06:54.16
But sometimes we heard him screaming in his sleep.

79
00:06:55.16 --> 00:06:58.16
You see this poncho? You see it? Smell it.

80
00:06:58.16 --> 00:07:03.16
It's got the same musty odor of the jungle. Smell the fungus. Smell it.

81
00:07:04.16 --> 00:07:07.16
I wrapped up a lot of bodies in these ponchos.

82
00:07:08.16 --> 00:07:12.16
You goddamn stupid trainees. You'll see you'll all be over there.

83
00:07:16.16 --> 00:07:24.16
Yeah, I mean this is 1967. So you're starting to get trained by guys that are coming back from the war.

84
00:07:24.16 --> 00:07:30.16
And they're going to have a little bit of different attitude than if they were a peace time guys.

85
00:07:31.16 --> 00:07:35.16
Although this is, you know, the Korean war was shortly before this and the World War II.

86
00:07:36.16 --> 00:07:38.16
So you have a lot of veterans in the war at this time.

87
00:07:39.16 --> 00:07:41.16
When I came in when I was going through seal training there was not a lot of combat veterans.

88
00:07:42.16 --> 00:07:44.16
There was there was some Vietnam guys for sure.

89
00:07:45.16 --> 00:07:48.16
But you know, I was going through a 1991.

90
00:07:48.16 --> 00:07:53.16
So most of the Vietnam guys were getting towards the end of their career.

91
00:07:54.16 --> 00:07:56.16
The Vietnam war for the teams.

92
00:07:57.16 --> 00:07:59.16
What was it? 72. Maybe the last two ones went over there.

93
00:08:00.16 --> 00:08:03.16
So they were at the end of their 20 year mark. You know, some of the guys that stuck around for 30 years. Yeah.

94
00:08:04.16 --> 00:08:08.16
Roger Aiden. Yeah. For sure. There's some of those old master chiefs. Absolutely.

95
00:08:09.16 --> 00:08:14.16
But those weren't your primary instructors. Your primary instructors were guys that had been in for five years and never seen combat.

96
00:08:14.16 --> 00:08:18.16
So that all changed now. Of course, with the current wars going on.

97
00:08:19.16 --> 00:08:23.16
Back to the book February 13th, 1969 orders.

98
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:27.16
It's not very pleasant to get orders overseas.

99
00:08:27.16 --> 00:08:29.16
The initial shock honestly scares you a lot.

100
00:08:30.16 --> 00:08:31.16
You think,

101
00:08:32.16 --> 00:08:33.16
Maybe I'll die.

102
00:08:34.16 --> 00:08:38.16
But later, the endless reams of paperwork show you dying is not that simple.

103
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:43.16
Take your plague, flu, typhus and cholera shots, for example.

104
00:08:44.16 --> 00:08:47.16
One medical sergeant is Mac the knife, especially if you're on orders.

105
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:54.16
Then there's RV end training in M16 rifle qualification and press orientation and a multitude of sign-out sheets.

106
00:08:55.16 --> 00:08:57.16
Do you have any overdue books at the post library?

107
00:08:58.16 --> 00:09:01.16
You think, yes, I do have an overdue book.

108
00:09:02.16 --> 00:09:05.16
Will they still send me to Vietnam if I keep it hidden under my laundry bag?

109
00:09:05.16 --> 00:09:13.16
June 1, 1969, the last night, before the plain leaves from Travis, you are together for the last time.

110
00:09:14.16 --> 00:09:16.16
Stoic and brave.

111
00:09:17.16 --> 00:09:19.16
At least that's how it is in the movies.

112
00:09:20.16 --> 00:09:25.16
In reality, you are sick and heart in the mind and belly.

113
00:09:26.16 --> 00:09:31.16
You talk of the past pretending, but knowing what each suffers silently.

114
00:09:31.16 --> 00:09:35.16
It isn't very pleasant or romantic at all.

115
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:42.16
Why are we such stupid people? She sobbed tears on sweat, body, clothes.

116
00:09:43.16 --> 00:09:44.16
You love her fiercely.

117
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:48.16
Your country is another question entirely.

118
00:09:53.16 --> 00:10:00.16
As usual, I am skipping through portions of this book to make it short enough

119
00:10:00.16 --> 00:10:02.16
to cover on the podcast.

120
00:10:03.16 --> 00:10:05.16
I don't even know if this book is in publication anymore.

121
00:10:06.16 --> 00:10:10.16
I had a PDF file from back in the day, and I don't even know where I got it from.

122
00:10:11.16 --> 00:10:15.16
I googled that there's some PDF files floating around, but get it.

123
00:10:16.16 --> 00:10:19.16
And read the whole thing. June 3, 1969, H.H.

124
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:27.16
Wars should be dramatic like the movies, sweating and landing in a craft, hitting the beach under fire.

125
00:10:27.16 --> 00:10:31.16
Who believe I went to war in a pink orange,

126
00:10:32.16 --> 00:10:35.16
Branif International airplane with a stewardess in purple leotards,

127
00:10:36.16 --> 00:10:38.16
wishing us a good trip on behalf of the captain in the crew?

128
00:10:39.16 --> 00:10:45.16
Going to war for Christ's sake in a pink orange airplane, I used to think war was somewhat serious.

129
00:10:46.16 --> 00:10:49.16
Then this is, again, this is a lot of people don't realize us.

130
00:10:50.16 --> 00:10:52.16
They use contract air, they still do that sometimes.

131
00:10:53.16 --> 00:10:54.16
And you'll fly over to civilian plane.

132
00:10:54.16 --> 00:10:58.16
July 6, 1969 airborne.

133
00:10:59.16 --> 00:11:05.16
Clouding dust betrays a lonely convoy dirt smothered, embraced in jungle vines and barren hills,

134
00:11:06.16 --> 00:11:07.16
Sullen crags and silence.

135
00:11:08.16 --> 00:11:14.16
A flash of light below, two more exploding lines, we see toy trucks crawling,

136
00:11:15.16 --> 00:11:17.16
clawing, spitting snake-like steel.

137
00:11:18.16 --> 00:11:20.16
Two small for life-sized war.

138
00:11:20.16 --> 00:11:23.16
Two far away for death.

139
00:11:24.16 --> 00:11:28.16
So his first visions of combat and he's looking down at it, it doesn't really,

140
00:11:29.16 --> 00:11:31.16
he's admitting he's like, two far away, it's not real form.

141
00:11:35.16 --> 00:11:36.16
That changes.

142
00:11:38.16 --> 00:11:41.16
July 17, 1969, my first body.

143
00:11:44.16 --> 00:11:48.16
I saw my first body lying west of Plai Kuh stretched out on a poncho,

144
00:11:48.16 --> 00:11:51.16
waiting to be airlifted back to the coast.

145
00:11:52.16 --> 00:11:55.16
He was gray white and very dead.

146
00:11:56.16 --> 00:12:00.16
Even today I can see his gaping bloody mouth gasping for air.

147
00:12:01.16 --> 00:12:05.16
A young kid who couldn't have been more than 20 years old.

148
00:12:07.16 --> 00:12:13.16
Then I thought, Christ, he's really, really dead.

149
00:12:13.16 --> 00:12:20.16
I remembered some James Bond and John Wayne's sickles and those TV melodromas

150
00:12:21.16 --> 00:12:24.16
where the American love for violence is only make believe.

151
00:12:25.16 --> 00:12:31.16
Where the movie and TV casualties can always get up and go home probably in time for supper.

152
00:12:34.16 --> 00:12:36.16
But this kid would not.

153
00:12:37.16 --> 00:12:41.16
He would make Walter Cronkites CBS News report

154
00:12:41.16 --> 00:12:43.16
as just another figure.

155
00:12:44.16 --> 00:12:49.16
Changing 229 American battle deaths reported this week to 230 instead.

156
00:12:52.16 --> 00:12:55.16
And then everyone, including the president,

157
00:12:55.16 --> 00:12:59.16
would turn to watch the Monday night football game on Channel 5.

158
00:13:02.16 --> 00:13:04.16
And here was my first body.

159
00:13:06.16 --> 00:13:09.16
I should have been trained for this sort of thing a long time ago.

160
00:13:09.16 --> 00:13:14.16
Playing cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, bang bang, you're dead.

161
00:13:16.16 --> 00:13:17.16
And he was.

162
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:21.16
He really was.

163
00:13:25.16 --> 00:13:30.16
July 25, 1969, remembrance 2.

164
00:13:33.16 --> 00:13:36.16
This is how I was when I saw you last.

165
00:13:36.16 --> 00:13:39.16
I was stagnant.

166
00:13:40.16 --> 00:13:45.16
Going no place and searching desperately for something I had lost long ago in the barracks.

167
00:13:46.16 --> 00:13:53.16
And so we escaped to the gray New England coast and the Boston fog and a warm downy bed to greet the night.

168
00:13:55.16 --> 00:13:58.16
And I began to live again and laugh.

169
00:14:00.16 --> 00:14:03.16
I love you still forgiving me that month.

170
00:14:03.16 --> 00:14:07.16
And forgiving yourself without promise.

171
00:14:18.16 --> 00:14:23.16
August 11, 1969, news item.

172
00:14:24.16 --> 00:14:28.16
It was president Nixon's first visit to Vietnam as president.

173
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:32.16
He insisted on going to Saigon rather than Camron Bay,

174
00:14:32.16 --> 00:14:34.16
the huge supply base.

175
00:14:35.16 --> 00:14:38.16
Camron Bay doesn't count. He said, that isn't Vietnam.

176
00:14:39.16 --> 00:14:42.16
Time magazine August 8, 1969.

177
00:14:45.16 --> 00:14:46.16
Deer Sir.

178
00:14:47.16 --> 00:14:50.16
In light of a vehicle on sapper attack on Camron Hospital,

179
00:14:51.16 --> 00:14:55.16
I questioned the source of those people who believe Camron Bay isn't Vietnam.

180
00:14:57.16 --> 00:15:01.16
I think the 98 men who are casualties and the parents of those who were killed

181
00:15:01.16 --> 00:15:05.16
would agree that Camron Bay is an exactly Disneyland.

182
00:15:07.16 --> 00:15:09.16
You bastard.

183
00:15:21.16 --> 00:15:23.16
September 1, 1969.

184
00:15:24.16 --> 00:15:26.16
Rodriguez.

185
00:15:26.16 --> 00:15:30.16
Jim Rodriguez was killed last week.

186
00:15:31.16 --> 00:15:33.16
After only 12 days in country,

187
00:15:34.16 --> 00:15:41.16
I remember as an upperclassman how we locked his heels together and taught him the OCS version of military discipline.

188
00:15:43.16 --> 00:15:45.16
It was double time.

189
00:15:46.16 --> 00:15:50.16
Four times around the field, Boony runs added to Jack's harassment and constant pressure.

190
00:15:50.16 --> 00:15:54.16
Physically and mentally, Rodriguez never broke.

191
00:15:56.16 --> 00:16:00.16
A matter of fact, he met our challenge one better and went on to airborne training,

192
00:16:01.16 --> 00:16:04.16
training briefly serving later as an airborne instructor.

193
00:16:06.16 --> 00:16:09.16
I wonder how much we really influenced Rodriguez.

194
00:16:11.16 --> 00:16:13.16
We showed him how to play soldier,

195
00:16:14.16 --> 00:16:16.16
but no one ever taught him how to play war.

196
00:16:16.16 --> 00:16:21.16
It's hard to play games with dead men.

197
00:16:26.16 --> 00:16:34.16
Yeah, like I said, this style of writing, this just straight forward style of writing.

198
00:16:35.16 --> 00:16:37.16
It's different.

199
00:16:38.16 --> 00:16:39.16
It's different.

200
00:16:40.16 --> 00:16:42.16
There's something very gutteral about it.

201
00:16:42.16 --> 00:16:45.16
It seems like he's writing this with when he wrote this.

202
00:16:46.16 --> 00:16:48.16
He had no intention of whatever he was ever sharing it with anyone.

203
00:16:49.16 --> 00:16:50.16
That's kind of what it seems.

204
00:16:51.16 --> 00:16:54.16
Especially he's talking about the woman that he loved back home.

205
00:16:55.16 --> 00:16:57.16
You can see his attitude.

206
00:16:58.16 --> 00:17:01.16
It goes kind of all over the place sometimes.

207
00:17:02.16 --> 00:17:07.16
And so there's a sort of level of just reality in this that I don't know.

208
00:17:07.16 --> 00:17:18.16
It's really, it hits in a different way than many of the books, many of the books.

209
00:17:22.16 --> 00:17:25.16
September 10, 1969 combat engineers,

210
00:17:26.16 --> 00:17:31.16
bronze backs bent to bridges, culverts, picks and timber trussles,

211
00:17:31.16 --> 00:17:35.16
sweat and grime and death by hidden minds and snipers,

212
00:17:37.16 --> 00:17:39.16
construction repair,

213
00:17:40.16 --> 00:17:43.16
and when will you fix my air conditioner, ask headquarters.

214
00:17:45.16 --> 00:17:49.16
Again, I know I've talked about the engineers that work with us in a body

215
00:17:50.16 --> 00:17:55.16
and how incredibly hard and dangerous that job was.

216
00:17:56.16 --> 00:17:59.16
Those guys were heroes like you couldn't even believe what these guys were doing.

217
00:17:59.16 --> 00:18:03.16
And this is just the same exact sentiment there.

218
00:18:04.16 --> 00:18:06.16
I just said engineers, he's as combat engineers, that's exactly right.

219
00:18:07.16 --> 00:18:09.16
It's combat engineers, 100%.

220
00:18:12.16 --> 00:18:16.16
September 11, 1969 artillery can encrashes eastward,

221
00:18:17.16 --> 00:18:22.16
magnificent terrible thunder, bright flash, night boarded,

222
00:18:23.16 --> 00:18:25.16
assuraging mass explodes in thunder,

223
00:18:25.16 --> 00:18:31.16
pagence of fire, again, again, in savage awe,

224
00:18:32.16 --> 00:18:35.16
we celebrate the festival of death.

225
00:18:39.16 --> 00:18:44.16
September 20, 1969, a heavy load on the way back from Queen Non yesterday,

226
00:18:45.16 --> 00:18:48.16
we stopped our Jeep to help an old man with a heavy load,

227
00:18:49.16 --> 00:18:51.16
which had fallen by the side of the road.

228
00:18:51.16 --> 00:18:54.16
The old man was carrying home the remains of his youngest son,

229
00:18:55.16 --> 00:18:58.16
who had died during recent fighting on Long The Cambodian border.

230
00:18:59.16 --> 00:19:03.16
The sidegun government he said had provided a free coffin

231
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:06.16
and transportation back to his village,

232
00:19:07.16 --> 00:19:10.16
but the truck had lost an axle five kilometers down the road.

233
00:19:12.16 --> 00:19:14.16
This wasn't his first tragedy.

234
00:19:15.16 --> 00:19:19.16
He told us that his eldest son had died two years older, earlier,

235
00:19:19.16 --> 00:19:22.16
in the assault on way,

236
00:19:23.16 --> 00:19:27.16
but he never saw that son's body since he was a vet-con.

237
00:19:29.16 --> 00:19:33.16
He was an old man, he said, heartbroken and ignorant.

238
00:19:34.16 --> 00:19:39.16
He had lost two sons, drafted a fight on different sides of the war.

239
00:19:39.16 --> 00:19:46.16
And even now, he didn't really know what they had died for.

240
00:19:49.16 --> 00:19:51.16
We hear that about the Civil War in America,

241
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:54.16
that you'd have brothers fighting against brothers.

242
00:19:55.16 --> 00:19:56.16
And I mean, clearly this happened in Vietnam,

243
00:19:57.16 --> 00:20:00.16
but you don't think of a guy that's given up on the son to each side

244
00:20:01.16 --> 00:20:02.16
and they're both dead.

245
00:20:02.16 --> 00:20:07.16
September 24th, 1969, a night.

246
00:20:09.16 --> 00:20:15.16
The heavens lie beyond us void, yet filled with substance, light and form, infinity.

247
00:20:17.16 --> 00:20:19.16
From nothing all exists,

248
00:20:21.16 --> 00:20:25.16
as billions age our world not yet a grain of sand

249
00:20:26.16 --> 00:20:28.16
in mighty awe, the universe endures.

250
00:20:28.16 --> 00:20:33.16
Mordle, weak and woman born, look beyond the sky,

251
00:20:34.16 --> 00:20:37.16
some clear and cloven night by lands and meet the sea,

252
00:20:38.16 --> 00:20:42.16
embrace the stars in infinite conceit,

253
00:20:43.16 --> 00:20:46.16
deny from nothing all you feel,

254
00:20:47.16 --> 00:20:51.16
and celebrate the overmind, original primal force,

255
00:20:52.16 --> 00:20:54.16
the birth of all that.

256
00:20:54.16 --> 00:20:58.16
The original primal force, the birth of all that is.

257
00:21:05.16 --> 00:21:08.16
October 2, 1969, the convoy.

258
00:21:10.16 --> 00:21:12.16
Two hours before the dawn,

259
00:21:13.16 --> 00:21:15.16
our convoy groups quietly efficiently.

260
00:21:16.16 --> 00:21:18.16
Trailer tanks and armor trucks with plated steel alert.

261
00:21:18.16 --> 00:21:22.16
Rose of limitless in human war machines,

262
00:21:23.16 --> 00:21:27.16
assembled in Detroit from America's great arsenal of doubt.

263
00:21:28.16 --> 00:21:30.16
Giant tinker toys of war,

264
00:21:31.16 --> 00:21:33.16
the mission always comes before the welfare of the man.

265
00:21:34.16 --> 00:21:37.16
The all-pervading mission that no one ever knows,

266
00:21:38.16 --> 00:21:39.16
the men come second,

267
00:21:40.16 --> 00:21:43.16
rose of tired army ants and dusty all of drab,

268
00:21:44.16 --> 00:21:46.16
no longer young, grim and grimy,

269
00:21:46.16 --> 00:21:48.16
keep their faith in faded photographs of home,

270
00:21:49.16 --> 00:21:51.16
a virgin hope of things to come.

271
00:21:52.16 --> 00:21:54.16
Or some in beads,

272
00:21:55.16 --> 00:21:58.16
an albatross of peace medallions hanging from their tarnish neck,

273
00:21:59.16 --> 00:22:01.16
a human cry and muted rage to say,

274
00:22:02.16 --> 00:22:04.16
at war, I am, I am.

275
00:22:07.16 --> 00:22:10.16
The soon forgotten symbols of a never-carrying world.

276
00:22:10.16 --> 00:22:16.16
It's time to move, a hundred muffled coughs and snars of steel

277
00:22:17.16 --> 00:22:19.16
and iron trucks, the schedule must be met.

278
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:21.16
We can't be late for war.

279
00:22:23.16 --> 00:22:26.16
The dawn is rising as we rumble past our first awakened village.

280
00:22:27.16 --> 00:22:29.16
Here people move to fold and field,

281
00:22:30.16 --> 00:22:33.16
a farmer even now to toil behind his beast

282
00:22:34.16 --> 00:22:36.16
and plow the sacred soil his father once endured.

283
00:22:36.16 --> 00:22:39.16
His desecrated tomb of craters, mines and shells

284
00:22:40.16 --> 00:22:43.16
across the ridge and down the dusty roads.

285
00:22:44.16 --> 00:22:46.16
But it will pass.

286
00:22:47.16 --> 00:22:49.16
It always has.

287
00:22:50.16 --> 00:22:53.16
The land in doors, all things.

288
00:22:57.16 --> 00:23:01.16
Very true statement, very true statement.

289
00:23:01.16 --> 00:23:06.16
Especially here at Medi-Can imagine.

290
00:23:07.16 --> 00:23:08.16
So what did I say?

291
00:23:09.16 --> 00:23:10.16
1969 yet.

292
00:23:11.16 --> 00:23:11.16
1969.

293
00:23:12.16 --> 00:23:15.16
He's looking at these farmers and this war is going on all around them.

294
00:23:16.16 --> 00:23:19.16
And guess what they're doing, they're doing what they've been doing for thousands of years.

295
00:23:20.16 --> 00:23:22.16
They're flying those fields and this war is going to come and it's going to go.

296
00:23:23.16 --> 00:23:24.16
And they're still going to be there doing what they do.

297
00:23:25.16 --> 00:23:26.16
The soil is going to endure.

298
00:23:26.16 --> 00:23:31.16
The land is going to endure.

299
00:23:32.16 --> 00:23:34.16
October 9, 1969, the sporting life.

300
00:23:35.16 --> 00:23:37.16
I met a huge gunship pilot in Queen-On,

301
00:23:38.16 --> 00:23:41.16
who had just extended his tour of duty down in the May-Colong Delta.

302
00:23:42.16 --> 00:23:45.16
Most pilots did the job they had to do and then went home.

303
00:23:46.16 --> 00:23:47.16
But not this one.

304
00:23:48.16 --> 00:23:49.16
He actually enjoyed his work.

305
00:23:50.16 --> 00:23:53.16
He bragged to a group of us one night that during a dull day

306
00:23:53.16 --> 00:23:56.16
where there was little action in the Delta he kept in practice

307
00:23:56.16 --> 00:23:59.16
by shooting at numerous water buffalo in rice patties

308
00:24:00.16 --> 00:24:02.16
and sniping at frightened farmers.

309
00:24:03.16 --> 00:24:06.16
In one case he said he played Captain Mouse

310
00:24:07.16 --> 00:24:09.16
with an old papa son on a bicycle,

311
00:24:10.16 --> 00:24:11.16
weaving frantically down the road.

312
00:24:12.16 --> 00:24:14.16
I scared to hell out of him for a while he said.

313
00:24:15.16 --> 00:24:18.16
Then I got him good with a beautiful long burst.

314
00:24:19.16 --> 00:24:19.16
No chance.

315
00:24:20.16 --> 00:24:21.16
Hell he was in a free fire zone.

316
00:24:21.16 --> 00:24:23.16
Probably V.C. anyways.

317
00:24:23.16 --> 00:24:25.16
All the slopes down there are V.C.

318
00:24:27.16 --> 00:24:29.16
We looked at him incredulously.

319
00:24:30.16 --> 00:24:32.16
And then left his table, leaving him alone,

320
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:34.16
gloting to himself.

321
00:24:36.16 --> 00:24:41.16
Even at war he remained a leper within some strange, unwritten code.

322
00:24:41.16 --> 00:24:44.16
I wish you were here right now.

323
00:24:45.16 --> 00:24:48.16
So I could hold you very close and tell you things.

324
00:24:49.16 --> 00:24:51.16
There are no words for him.

325
00:24:52.16 --> 00:24:56.16
I wish you were here right now.

326
00:24:57.16 --> 00:25:01.16
So I could hold you very close and tell you things.

327
00:25:01.16 --> 00:25:11.16
There are no words for him.

328
00:25:12.16 --> 00:25:16.16
October 14th, 1969, home won.

329
00:25:17.16 --> 00:25:21.16
We cling to something close at home, a girl or shadow on the wall,

330
00:25:22.16 --> 00:25:25.16
free son, a ragged hope, so precious and return.

331
00:25:26.16 --> 00:25:28.16
If you're not in the middle of the road,

332
00:25:28.16 --> 00:25:30.16
your precious and return.

333
00:25:32.16 --> 00:25:33.16
If lost, we too are lost.

334
00:25:34.16 --> 00:25:36.16
Not finding hate as soldiers seldom hate,

335
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:39.16
but bitter, stale, in passion, dead.

336
00:25:41.16 --> 00:25:47.16
We lose our need to love home too.

337
00:25:49.16 --> 00:25:51.16
I love you as gentle dawn,

338
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:54.16
Spread out against the savage sky

339
00:25:54.16 --> 00:25:59.16
a part of life so very far away.

340
00:26:02.16 --> 00:26:09.16
Yet, again, important to point out as I always try to,

341
00:26:09.16 --> 00:26:15.16
that these men that went to war were not just soldiers

342
00:26:15.16 --> 00:26:19.16
and not just Marines and not just sailors, not just airmen,

343
00:26:19.16 --> 00:26:23.16
but they were men with hopes and dreams.

344
00:26:23.16 --> 00:26:26.16
They were men and love with that girl back home,

345
00:26:26.16 --> 00:26:29.16
and they couldn't stop thinking about her.

346
00:26:34.16 --> 00:26:39.16
October 23rd, 1969, May.

347
00:26:39.16 --> 00:26:43.16
I was talking to May today, a pretty Vietnamese girl,

348
00:26:43.16 --> 00:26:46.16
who works in headquarters to touch me as a secretary,

349
00:26:46.16 --> 00:26:48.16
May speaks English very well.

350
00:26:48.16 --> 00:26:51.16
And often we joke and talk about a lot of trivial things,

351
00:26:51.16 --> 00:26:54.16
but today the conversation was more serious.

352
00:26:54.16 --> 00:26:57.16
What would happen, I asked her,

353
00:26:57.16 --> 00:27:01.16
if the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese take over the South one day?

354
00:27:02.16 --> 00:27:05.16
May's face remained impassive.

355
00:27:05.16 --> 00:27:09.16
I worked for the Americans, so they would shoot me,

356
00:27:09.16 --> 00:27:12.16
then they would kill my family.

357
00:27:12.16 --> 00:27:18.16
And that is the reality.

358
00:27:18.16 --> 00:27:23.16
And that's the reality that, you know, when ISIS came into Romadi,

359
00:27:23.16 --> 00:27:26.16
after we had left about seven years, after we had left,

360
00:27:26.16 --> 00:27:29.16
and after Romadi had been peaceful for about seven years,

361
00:27:29.16 --> 00:27:31.16
and ISIS came in and took it over.

362
00:27:31.16 --> 00:27:33.16
It's one of the first things that they did was they,

363
00:27:33.16 --> 00:27:38.16
anyone that they knew had worked with coalition forces at all,

364
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:39.16
they got murdered.

365
00:27:39.16 --> 00:27:42.16
And their families got murdered.

366
00:27:42.16 --> 00:27:46.16
And from what I, the information that I received from my contacts

367
00:27:46.16 --> 00:27:49.16
over there was about 500 families were murdered.

368
00:27:49.16 --> 00:27:52.16
All of them.

369
00:27:52.16 --> 00:27:57.16
So yeah, when, if you're going to go into a country,

370
00:27:57.16 --> 00:27:59.16
and you're going to work there,

371
00:27:59.16 --> 00:28:01.16
and you're going to support some of the people,

372
00:28:01.16 --> 00:28:04.16
make sure you stay there and told the job is done.

373
00:28:04.16 --> 00:28:06.16
No, 22nd.

374
00:28:06.16 --> 00:28:09.16
1969, slopes and dunks.

375
00:28:09.16 --> 00:28:13.16
He was a young, box sergeant from Alabama.

376
00:28:13.16 --> 00:28:16.16
Proud of his artillery days at Fort Cilocal Homa,

377
00:28:16.16 --> 00:28:21.16
and proud to defend America from worldwide communist aggression.

378
00:28:21.16 --> 00:28:26.16
The Vietnamese communists in his eyes were subhumans.

379
00:28:26.16 --> 00:28:31.16
Anyway, slopes and dunks who felt no human emotion,

380
00:28:31.16 --> 00:28:33.16
and therefore who could have been killed.

381
00:28:33.16 --> 00:28:36.16
He saw this enemy he told me for the first time

382
00:28:36.16 --> 00:28:37.16
during the 10th of 1969 when, for days and nights on end,

383
00:28:37.16 --> 00:28:40.16
his battery kept mowing down human wave enemy assaults

384
00:28:40.16 --> 00:28:43.16
by lowering the Howard Cers to tree trunk level

385
00:28:43.16 --> 00:28:48.16
and firing bumblebee canisters which sprayed thousands of anti-personnel darts

386
00:28:48.16 --> 00:28:50.16
into the enemy troops.

387
00:28:50.16 --> 00:28:53.16
And the enemy was killed by the

388
00:28:53.16 --> 00:28:55.16
army of the army.

389
00:28:55.16 --> 00:28:57.16
And the army was killed by the army.

390
00:28:57.16 --> 00:28:59.16
And the army was killed by the army.

391
00:28:59.16 --> 00:29:04.16
And the army was killed by the army.

392
00:29:04.16 --> 00:29:07.16
But still they kept on coming.

393
00:29:07.16 --> 00:29:11.16
One wave after another.

394
00:29:11.16 --> 00:29:13.16
On the night after the last attack,

395
00:29:13.16 --> 00:29:16.16
he went out with a small patrol to survey the damage

396
00:29:16.16 --> 00:29:22.16
and found hundreds and thousands of the enemy dead.

397
00:29:22.16 --> 00:29:26.16
But he also found frightened young boys and young men

398
00:29:26.16 --> 00:29:28.16
who had died clutching one another in terror.

399
00:29:28.16 --> 00:29:33.16
Or who had died trying to bandage each other's wounds.

400
00:29:33.16 --> 00:29:36.16
And the young sergeant told me that he knew then

401
00:29:36.16 --> 00:29:39.16
that they must also have mothers, sisters,

402
00:29:39.16 --> 00:29:42.16
and wives at home just like his men.

403
00:29:42.16 --> 00:29:45.16
And that they had been terrified during the battle

404
00:29:45.16 --> 00:29:47.16
just like his men.

405
00:29:47.16 --> 00:29:55.16
And that they bled and fell pain and cried just like his men.

406
00:29:55.16 --> 00:30:00.16
And he never called them slopes or dunks ever again.

407
00:30:00.16 --> 00:30:19.16
November 21, 1969, Sydney, Australia.

408
00:30:19.16 --> 00:30:23.16
After six months at war, a ten-day miracle.

409
00:30:23.16 --> 00:30:26.16
A beautiful heavenly city on the bay.

410
00:30:26.16 --> 00:30:29.16
The front-tier spirit with a rise sense of Aussie humor.

411
00:30:29.16 --> 00:30:32.16
Drinking a skoener of swan lager with new friends,

412
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:36.16
invited everywhere, a genuine Australian openness,

413
00:30:36.16 --> 00:30:40.16
up front and honest, the bay and the opera house.

414
00:30:40.16 --> 00:30:42.16
Bondi Beach riding the waves, the restaurants,

415
00:30:42.16 --> 00:30:45.16
a nightlife incredibly beautiful tall Australian girls,

416
00:30:45.16 --> 00:30:48.16
disarming in very real.

417
00:30:48.16 --> 00:30:52.16
Not afraid to be themselves to disagree, out going in direct,

418
00:30:52.16 --> 00:30:55.16
deep and beautiful like their city.

419
00:30:55.16 --> 00:30:59.16
Sydney, Australia, the reality of heaven,

420
00:30:59.16 --> 00:31:01.16
treating us as people again and true friends,

421
00:31:01.16 --> 00:31:05.16
making us feel more at home than home itself.

422
00:31:05.16 --> 00:31:08.16
Our last night was spent in a seafood restaurant.

423
00:31:08.16 --> 00:31:10.16
Mrs. Murphy, the restaurant older told us,

424
00:31:10.16 --> 00:31:14.16
if you'd come earlier boys, we'd have had some fine dates

425
00:31:14.16 --> 00:31:16.16
for you tonight.

426
00:31:16.16 --> 00:31:20.16
Unfortunately, no wine was sold after nine pm with dinner.

427
00:31:20.16 --> 00:31:22.16
An older couple approached our table.

428
00:31:22.16 --> 00:31:24.16
Here boys take our bottle.

429
00:31:24.16 --> 00:31:27.16
Your father's really helped us during the last war.

430
00:31:27.16 --> 00:31:30.16
And we know how you feel about this one.

431
00:31:30.16 --> 00:31:33.16
God bless you and take care boys.

432
00:31:33.16 --> 00:31:35.16
Take care.

433
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:37.16
Sydney, Australia.

434
00:31:37.16 --> 00:31:39.16
A beautiful lasting friendship.

435
00:31:39.16 --> 00:31:42.16
I love a fair with life that back in Vietnam.

436
00:31:42.16 --> 00:31:45.16
Had all two soon the unfamiliar face.

437
00:31:45.16 --> 00:31:50.16
That precious things take on when our heart is left behind.

438
00:31:58.16 --> 00:31:59.16
Yeah, I came in.

439
00:31:59.16 --> 00:32:02.16
I've been to Australia and it's awesome.

440
00:32:02.16 --> 00:32:06.16
And I can't even imagine when it would be like going from the Vietnam war

441
00:32:06.16 --> 00:32:08.16
into Australia for ten days of leave.

442
00:32:08.16 --> 00:32:12.16
And to have the Australian people just be awesome.

443
00:32:12.16 --> 00:32:17.16
So, to the Aussies out there, thanks for the support.

444
00:32:21.16 --> 00:32:24.16
December 19th, 1969, incoming.

445
00:32:24.16 --> 00:32:28.16
Adolf Thud, muffled close, growing fearful,

446
00:32:28.16 --> 00:32:31.16
Fud followed twice.

447
00:32:31.16 --> 00:32:33.16
Another crash, Christ, body, feet,

448
00:32:33.16 --> 00:32:37.16
flailing, hands and sweat, waiting, waiting, crash.

449
00:32:37.16 --> 00:32:40.16
God, O Jesus, crash.

450
00:32:40.16 --> 00:32:44.16
Reseding, thud, waiting, still waiting.

451
00:32:44.16 --> 00:32:46.16
Not you, thank God.

452
00:32:46.16 --> 00:32:48.16
Move your head, not you.

453
00:32:48.16 --> 00:32:50.16
Move your arm.

454
00:32:50.16 --> 00:32:52.16
Not this time.

455
00:32:54.16 --> 00:32:56.16
So, there you go.

456
00:32:56.16 --> 00:32:57.16
That's incoming.

457
00:32:57.16 --> 00:32:59.16
That's waiting for.

458
00:32:59.16 --> 00:33:02.16
That's when you hear it, when you hear it, get launched.

459
00:33:02.16 --> 00:33:03.16
And you know it's coming.

460
00:33:03.16 --> 00:33:04.16
That's what it is.

461
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:06.16
When you say not you, that's like he's checking.

462
00:33:06.16 --> 00:33:07.16
Dang is that.

463
00:33:07.16 --> 00:33:08.16
Yeah, move your head hit.

464
00:33:08.16 --> 00:33:09.16
Nope, not you.

465
00:33:09.16 --> 00:33:10.16
Move your arm.

466
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:11.16
Not this time or good.

467
00:33:11.16 --> 00:33:12.16
Yeah.

468
00:33:12.16 --> 00:33:13.16
Yeah.

469
00:33:13.16 --> 00:33:14.16
Yeah.

470
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:15.16
Yeah.

471
00:33:15.16 --> 00:33:24.16
January 22nd, 1970 dispatch at 19, 1145 hours.

472
00:33:24.16 --> 00:33:29.16
10 kilometers northwest of Hoynon, a 16 year old youth from a nearby Hamlet, entered

473
00:33:29.16 --> 00:33:30.16
Fond Quit.

474
00:33:30.16 --> 00:33:35.16
Hamlet and through two fragmentation grenades into a group of children and marines of the

475
00:33:35.16 --> 00:33:41.16
USC combined civic action, built-in two three seven.

476
00:33:41.16 --> 00:33:47.16
There were four friendly killed in action, Vietnamese children and 15 wounded in action, 11 Vietnamese children

477
00:33:47.16 --> 00:33:51.16
and four United States Marine Corps.

478
00:33:51.16 --> 00:33:58.16
The youth who threw the grenades escaped.

479
00:33:58.16 --> 00:34:04.16
That's just, I mean, just that snapshot of what you're dealing with.

480
00:34:04.16 --> 00:34:08.16
There you are in a civic action, built-in out there trying to help out.

481
00:34:08.16 --> 00:34:19.16
And a 16 year old kid comes in hooks to grenades and wounds 11 of the little kids you're trying to help and four of your men.

482
00:34:19.16 --> 00:34:27.16
And that's what your life is.

483
00:34:27.16 --> 00:34:31.16
February 4th, 1970.

484
00:34:31.16 --> 00:34:38.16
And pleading eyes are combat medic with all his tubes and bottles could never heal that gaping wound.

485
00:34:38.16 --> 00:34:43.16
Nor still your fearful cry.

486
00:34:43.16 --> 00:34:58.16
Jesus, God, what a petty, careless war when armies crash and hate to disembowl a child.

487
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:07.16
February 15th, 1970, a green beret in not-train.

488
00:35:07.16 --> 00:35:13.16
One can never generalize about individual divisions regiments or any particular unit.

489
00:35:13.16 --> 00:35:17.16
It's hard enough generalizing about particular people.

490
00:35:17.16 --> 00:35:24.16
But in not-train, I did meet a green beret who, as one individual, was at least honest about his motivation.

491
00:35:24.16 --> 00:35:28.16
I was sharing his battle of Jack Daniels a nice.

492
00:35:28.16 --> 00:35:31.16
I joined the Green berets for excitement, I guess.

493
00:35:31.16 --> 00:35:37.16
On one hand, we're living with the yards raising crops growing pigs and hunting Charlie.

494
00:35:37.16 --> 00:35:41.16
On the other hand, you kill and drink, smoke and horror.

495
00:35:41.16 --> 00:35:45.16
Every minute may be your last, you know what I mean?

496
00:35:45.16 --> 00:35:51.16
Man, if I were back in the States doing this sort of thing, I'd either be dead or sitting on death row by now.

497
00:35:51.16 --> 00:35:55.16
But over here, we've got a free license, you know what I mean?

498
00:35:55.16 --> 00:36:01.16
Your setty was thinking of settling down after the war, getting into a business trainee program when he got back to the States,

499
00:36:01.16 --> 00:36:08.16
or maybe into some branch of law enforcement.

500
00:36:08.16 --> 00:36:16.16
Yeah, war is suited to some people, for sure.

501
00:36:16.16 --> 00:36:19.16
March 1, 1970, interlude.

502
00:36:19.16 --> 00:36:23.16
I saw a movie tonight that made me think of you.

503
00:36:23.16 --> 00:36:26.16
It's bad, thinking, you know?

504
00:36:26.16 --> 00:36:31.16
Yesterday, I thought of Lee, who is killed last month in one corps.

505
00:36:31.16 --> 00:36:35.16
The movie was one of the few we saw together last year.

506
00:36:35.16 --> 00:36:41.16
How different, seeing it again, alone sitting in the sand at war?

507
00:36:41.16 --> 00:36:45.16
It made me think of our own interlude.

508
00:36:45.16 --> 00:36:58.16
Why we could never accept less than we had, and would never have again.

509
00:36:58.16 --> 00:37:03.16
I don't know if you want to think about that sentence too much. It's a little bit heavy.

510
00:37:03.16 --> 00:37:12.16
Why we could never accept less than we had, and would never have again.

511
00:37:12.16 --> 00:37:16.16
March 4, remembrance 3.

512
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:20.16
When you smiled at me, I knew you were different.

513
00:37:20.16 --> 00:37:26.16
You had no snide remark for my uniform, or ununnered, a look of mock pity,

514
00:37:26.16 --> 00:37:31.16
which seemed to say, look everybody, it's one of them again.

515
00:37:31.16 --> 00:37:35.16
And you didn't approach me with a fashionable, overriding concern,

516
00:37:35.16 --> 00:37:39.16
or preached to me from a pre-assembled dreadnought of morality.

517
00:37:39.16 --> 00:37:46.16
No, and you didn't stare away from me, or at me, or threw me, all you said was hello.

518
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:53.16
But through that one simple word, I was no longer alone.

519
00:37:53.16 --> 00:37:59.16
Observation, flower pedal, pushing through the crusted earth,

520
00:37:59.16 --> 00:38:03.16
embraces light and dies.

521
00:38:03.16 --> 00:38:10.16
The ugly root, endures, but never booms.

522
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:22.16
March 14, 1970, the provost Marshall,

523
00:38:22.16 --> 00:38:25.16
Jeep stealing in Vietnam was a national pastime.

524
00:38:25.16 --> 00:38:28.16
The Vietnamese nationals had acquired chain cutters,

525
00:38:28.16 --> 00:38:34.16
and became very adept at Western automakanics, with special emphasis in jump-starting the engines

526
00:38:34.16 --> 00:38:38.16
and removing all cereal or identification markings with lightning speed.

527
00:38:38.16 --> 00:38:43.16
Even the shorebound navy installations took great delight in their midnight

528
00:38:43.16 --> 00:38:45.16
requisitions of army material.

529
00:38:45.16 --> 00:38:51.16
And the green berets from Nautreng had on one occasion brought in a CH-47 sling helicopter

530
00:38:51.16 --> 00:38:57.16
and airlifted away a brand new vehicle that was apparently impossible to obtain through ordinary supply channels.

531
00:38:57.16 --> 00:39:05.16
Yes, the new provost Marshall at Cameron Bay decided to do something about these thefts.

532
00:39:05.16 --> 00:39:10.16
An implemented a stern directive from the military police to all personnel who had their vehicle stolen.

533
00:39:10.16 --> 00:39:14.16
They would now have to write an extensive report in triplicate to the provost Marshall,

534
00:39:14.16 --> 00:39:18.16
explaining the surrounding circumstances and further appear before a board of inquiry,

535
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:26.16
remaining liable to possible article 15, or cart martial proceedings for negligently allowing these thefts to occur.

536
00:39:26.16 --> 00:39:33.16
These orders were to take fast to take effect by the provost Marshall's directive on March 11th.

537
00:39:33.16 --> 00:39:38.16
That would really take care of the problem, the provost Marshall promised the general,

538
00:39:38.16 --> 00:39:45.16
by the sternist measures and prompt prosecution of any negligent offenders.

539
00:39:45.16 --> 00:39:52.16
On the morning of March 13th, the provost Marshall was seen walking to work.

540
00:39:52.16 --> 00:39:58.16
Someone had stolen his Jeep.

541
00:39:58.16 --> 00:40:01.16
Yeah, I like that good little story.

542
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:03.16
There's that stuff definitely happens.

543
00:40:03.16 --> 00:40:07.16
My C-B's were quite good at that.

544
00:40:07.16 --> 00:40:13.16
So in Task Unit Bruser, we had C-B's, the construction battalion, they're navy,

545
00:40:13.16 --> 00:40:18.16
guys that do construction, but they also have combat skills.

546
00:40:18.16 --> 00:40:24.16
They're motto is we build, we fight, and they should have another motto that's like, we get things.

547
00:40:24.16 --> 00:40:26.16
So we need them.

548
00:40:26.16 --> 00:40:30.16
So my guys were awesome at that, and they were also awesome at everything else they did,

549
00:40:30.16 --> 00:40:35.16
but it was nice that when I needed something, they would find a way to acquire it.

550
00:40:35.16 --> 00:40:39.16
Thanks, their TU Bruser, C-B's.

551
00:40:39.16 --> 00:40:48.16
Alright, March 15th, 1970, graffiti. He's got the list of graffiti here.

552
00:40:48.16 --> 00:40:53.16
Life for 986 days in a wake-up.

553
00:40:53.16 --> 00:40:57.16
Next, prefer I came in to army, this is all misspelled.

554
00:40:57.16 --> 00:41:05.16
Before I came in to army, I couldn't spell engineer, now I won.

555
00:41:05.16 --> 00:41:11.16
Here's a good one. The US Army, 184 years of tradition, unhampered by progress.

556
00:41:11.16 --> 00:41:18.16
The army's like a rubber. It gives you that false sense of security while you're getting screwed.

557
00:41:18.16 --> 00:41:26.16
It's not a real war yet. We're just 550,000 military advisors.

558
00:41:26.16 --> 00:41:31.16
Fighting for pieces like screwing for chastity.

559
00:41:31.16 --> 00:41:35.16
Share in the fright with freedom, go home with a friend.

560
00:41:35.16 --> 00:41:41.16
Next, give me your hearts and minds, and I'll burn your fucking hut.

561
00:41:41.16 --> 00:41:47.16
Next war is hell, but a year without a woman is a real bitch.

562
00:41:47.16 --> 00:41:53.16
Next, how can we get to the moon, but I can't get home.

563
00:41:53.16 --> 00:41:58.16
Next, those personnel with short stacks and low-monet manifold pressure.

564
00:41:58.16 --> 00:42:03.16
Please taxi closer to the urinal.

565
00:42:03.16 --> 00:42:07.16
Next, the Assyrian lives, that's a little shout out to catch 22.

566
00:42:07.16 --> 00:42:15.16
The book. Next, would the last American soldier leaving Vietnam please turn out the light at the end of the tunnel?

567
00:42:15.16 --> 00:42:21.16
I think that's in reference to the fact that the higher-ups kept saying that they could see the light at the end of the tunnel.

568
00:42:21.16 --> 00:42:27.16
I am coming. We're getting there. We're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

569
00:42:27.16 --> 00:42:31.16
March 19th, 1970, love, LEV.

570
00:42:31.16 --> 00:42:37.16
We once had a little puppy called Love. She was the company mascot, and dug just about everyone.

571
00:42:37.16 --> 00:42:43.16
She was one of those beautiful little creatures who hadn't ever learned to hate or fear.

572
00:42:43.16 --> 00:42:45.16
She trusted everyone.

573
00:42:45.16 --> 00:42:51.16
Love trusted the sergeant too, even though the sergeant wanted her wasted as a damn nuisance.

574
00:42:51.16 --> 00:42:56.16
So love never came home with us, but neither did the sergeant.

575
00:42:56.16 --> 00:43:11.16
Better have struck convoyes and mechanized patrols often wed many men to their vehicles during most of their Vietnam tour.

576
00:43:11.16 --> 00:43:14.16
The names of such better have included.

577
00:43:14.16 --> 00:43:22.16
Here's the names of a bunch of different vehicles, battling Bob, psychedelic flower, old faithful roadrunner, acid rock, hell for certain,

578
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:33.16
puzzle palace, push your man, grim reaper, iron butterfly, grass-bender, artful dodger, moratorium, and malfunction junction.

579
00:43:33.16 --> 00:43:39.16
And my first deployment to Iraq, you might appreciate this.

580
00:43:39.16 --> 00:43:50.16
I think I've said this before, but our vehicles, my first deployment were named after after the movie Kingpin.

581
00:43:50.16 --> 00:43:54.16
Bigger and was one of them for sure, yeah, that was all.

582
00:43:54.16 --> 00:43:58.16
And then, I think it was primarily life's idea.

583
00:43:58.16 --> 00:44:06.16
He wanted to name and didn't name, they named all the vehicles after GI Joe characters, like co-break commander and stuff like that.

584
00:44:06.16 --> 00:44:11.16
So there you go, get some.

585
00:44:11.16 --> 00:44:16.16
You know, it's one of those things, like, is that just always going to happen?

586
00:44:16.16 --> 00:44:21.16
That's what I was saying. In 300 years, if you have a war, and there's some kind of vehicle, do you just name them?

587
00:44:21.16 --> 00:44:23.16
Whatever kind of cool names you can give them.

588
00:44:23.16 --> 00:44:30.16
I think it's because it's a little point of control that you have even as a frontline guy, like that you can do and it's cool.

589
00:44:30.16 --> 00:44:31.16
Yeah, it's like kind of-

590
00:44:31.16 --> 00:44:33.16
It's just your little, gives you war, a little character.

591
00:44:33.16 --> 00:44:45.16
Yeah, like it's a little fun thing. You can add, like, you know, how the patch is situation or, you know, just all that stuff or seal house BTF, you know, kind of thing.

592
00:44:45.16 --> 00:44:50.16
It's like, to kind of deviate from the war, the almost in your own, like, little-

593
00:44:50.16 --> 00:44:52.16
It's the last, for a little creativity.

594
00:44:52.16 --> 00:44:54.16
Little creativity, yes.

595
00:44:54.16 --> 00:45:02.16
It's funny because, well, naming vehicles was good, and I remember, so they we used a number of the vehicles,

596
00:45:02.16 --> 00:45:05.16
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or one, two, three, four, five, six or whatever, one, two, three, four, five.

597
00:45:05.16 --> 00:45:12.16
There's a problem with it though, because the vehicles aren't always where they're supposed to be when you get on a large scale.

598
00:45:12.16 --> 00:45:18.16
So you go, oh wait a second, so you'd go out and get a number of third vehicle, which is number three, but you weren't supposed to be in that vehicle.

599
00:45:18.16 --> 00:45:22.16
Number three vehicles, number six and position right now, because they got scrambled up while they were maneuvering.

600
00:45:22.16 --> 00:45:23.16
Yeah.

601
00:45:23.16 --> 00:45:26.16
So that's why we ended up- I told the guys name the vehicles, no numbers.

602
00:45:26.16 --> 00:45:30.16
That's what they did, named them, and they named them after Kingpin.

603
00:45:30.16 --> 00:45:31.16
Yeah, yeah.

604
00:45:31.16 --> 00:45:32.16
No.

605
00:45:32.16 --> 00:45:40.16
I think there might be a picture of- there's definitely some pictures of my first appointment in the dichotomy of, in the dichotomy of leadership book,

606
00:45:40.16 --> 00:45:46.16
but I want to see if you can see any of the vehicle names written on the side.

607
00:45:46.16 --> 00:45:48.16
Zevol is one of the ones that I saw.

608
00:45:48.16 --> 00:45:49.16
Big Zev.

609
00:45:49.16 --> 00:45:50.16
Yeah.

610
00:45:50.16 --> 00:45:52.16
Not in the book, but one of the pictures.

611
00:45:52.16 --> 00:45:53.16
That's me.

612
00:45:53.16 --> 00:45:55.16
That's from Ramadi.

613
00:45:55.16 --> 00:45:56.16
That was big Zev.

614
00:45:56.16 --> 00:45:59.16
I think that was actually our big giant warpick.

615
00:45:59.16 --> 00:46:05.16
I always liked, there was a- I think it was the Marine Corps had a big six-by-truck that was, they had warpick.

616
00:46:05.16 --> 00:46:06.16
That was a warpick.

617
00:46:06.16 --> 00:46:07.16
I always liked that one.

618
00:46:07.16 --> 00:46:11.16
That's kind of a given that you're going to have it, no, I was doing names on that vehicle.

619
00:46:11.16 --> 00:46:12.16
Check.

620
00:46:12.16 --> 00:46:13.16
Amen.

621
00:46:13.16 --> 00:46:17.16
Next March 20th, 1970, the two fronts.

622
00:46:21.16 --> 00:46:25.16
The kid was caught out in the open by a stray mortar round.

623
00:46:25.16 --> 00:46:28.16
They don't make coffee the way they used to the businessman said.

624
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:32.16
And those kids with long hair, Jesus.

625
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:35.16
The impact cut off his arm.

626
00:46:35.16 --> 00:46:37.16
The lower half of his right leg.

627
00:46:37.16 --> 00:46:39.16
And blew off half his head.

628
00:46:39.16 --> 00:46:41.16
Ousing red, black, blood into the sand.

629
00:46:41.16 --> 00:46:45.16
He was 19 years old and from Ohio.

630
00:46:45.16 --> 00:46:48.16
Well, the president must know what he's doing.

631
00:46:48.16 --> 00:46:49.16
He has my full support.

632
00:46:49.16 --> 00:46:51.16
Where the hell is the waitress?

633
00:46:51.16 --> 00:46:55.16
The kid only had two weeks left in Vietnam.

634
00:46:55.16 --> 00:46:59.16
Three days before he'd already framed a copy of his orders home.

635
00:46:59.16 --> 00:47:06.16
April 2nd, 1970, a bond of friendship.

636
00:47:06.16 --> 00:47:07.16
It was hot.

637
00:47:07.16 --> 00:47:10.16
The ambush had been effective.

638
00:47:10.16 --> 00:47:17.16
Out there in the brush, there was little protection from sight or hail of gunfire.

639
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:20.16
The soldier caught sight of his buddy seriously wounded.

640
00:47:20.16 --> 00:47:22.16
Sir, please, let me get him.

641
00:47:22.16 --> 00:47:23.16
Please.

642
00:47:23.16 --> 00:47:27.16
The officer, well aware of their deep friendship, hesitated.

643
00:47:27.16 --> 00:47:30.16
And then said, go, but it's not worth it.

644
00:47:30.16 --> 00:47:35.16
Your friend is probably dead and you may get killed trying.

645
00:47:35.16 --> 00:47:37.16
But the soldier went.

646
00:47:37.16 --> 00:47:41.16
Miraculously, he hoisted his friend onto his shoulders

647
00:47:41.16 --> 00:47:46.16
and under heavy fire, the two of them stumbled back into the trench.

648
00:47:46.16 --> 00:47:50.16
The officer looked tenderly at the would be rescuer.

649
00:47:50.16 --> 00:47:52.16
I told you it wouldn't be worth it.

650
00:47:52.16 --> 00:47:56.16
Your buddy is dead and you are badly wounded.

651
00:47:56.16 --> 00:48:00.16
I know sir, the soldier replied, but you're wrong.

652
00:48:00.16 --> 00:48:02.16
It was worth it.

653
00:48:02.16 --> 00:48:05.16
Because just before he died, he looked at me and said,

654
00:48:05.16 --> 00:48:08.16
I knew you'd come.

655
00:48:08.16 --> 00:48:13.16
It didn't matter that day that one man was white and the other black.

656
00:48:13.16 --> 00:48:23.16
Thank you, God, that out of a hellish war, we can still learn the meaning of true brotherhood.

657
00:48:23.16 --> 00:48:29.16
Chaplin Donald J. Robinson from the 101st Airborne Division.

658
00:48:29.16 --> 00:48:32.16
That's where he took that story from.

659
00:48:32.16 --> 00:48:38.16
When you were kind of jumping back and forth to like,

660
00:48:38.16 --> 00:48:42.16
Oh, coffee isn't made with you, is that with he like he had,

661
00:48:42.16 --> 00:48:43.16
he had, what, what?

662
00:48:43.16 --> 00:48:45.16
I should have described it a little bit better.

663
00:48:45.16 --> 00:48:48.16
He had one set of the stuff that was taking place in the civilian world

664
00:48:48.16 --> 00:48:49.16
back in the state.

665
00:48:49.16 --> 00:48:50.16
He had him parentheses.

666
00:48:50.16 --> 00:48:54.16
So while this kid is getting ripped apart by a mortar round,

667
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:58.16
back in American parentheses, it just says,

668
00:48:58.16 --> 00:49:01.16
you know, oh, hey, where's the way it's just landing?

669
00:49:01.16 --> 00:49:05.16
And you can imagine how, you know,

670
00:49:05.16 --> 00:49:09.16
I think even during World War II, during World War II,

671
00:49:09.16 --> 00:49:12.16
the guys were overfighting, but at home,

672
00:49:12.16 --> 00:49:15.16
like everyone was focused on the war effort.

673
00:49:15.16 --> 00:49:17.16
And they were rationing and they were building.

674
00:49:17.16 --> 00:49:21.16
They changed factories to start building planes instead of like civilian cars.

675
00:49:21.16 --> 00:49:23.16
They built war planes and they built bombs and they built ammunition.

676
00:49:23.16 --> 00:49:24.16
They built guns.

677
00:49:24.16 --> 00:49:26.16
Like the whole country was focused on it.

678
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:29.16
In Vietnam, that wasn't really happening.

679
00:49:29.16 --> 00:49:31.16
You know, wasn't really that same situation.

680
00:49:31.16 --> 00:49:34.16
If you got drafted, your whole world freaking went upside down.

681
00:49:34.16 --> 00:49:36.16
But if you didn't get drafted, you were going to live your normal life

682
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:39.16
and go work your job and live normal and go to the restaurant

683
00:49:39.16 --> 00:49:41.16
and ask where the hell of a waitresses.

684
00:49:41.16 --> 00:49:42.16
Yeah.

685
00:49:42.16 --> 00:49:43.16
Yeah.

686
00:49:46.16 --> 00:49:48.16
That's similar to what it's like now.

687
00:49:48.16 --> 00:49:50.16
I mean, actually, that is what it's like now.

688
00:49:50.16 --> 00:49:52.16
And I've talked about that a bunch of times.

689
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:53.16
Talk about it with Sam Harris.

690
00:49:53.16 --> 00:49:57.16
You know, we, the war, the wars that we have right now,

691
00:49:57.16 --> 00:50:00.16
there's a vast majority of the population of America.

692
00:50:00.16 --> 00:50:01.16
It doesn't affect them at all.

693
00:50:01.16 --> 00:50:03.16
It literally doesn't affect them at all.

694
00:50:03.16 --> 00:50:04.16
Yeah.

695
00:50:04.16 --> 00:50:07.16
Because it has had no impact on the food that you eat,

696
00:50:07.16 --> 00:50:09.16
the gas that you use, zero impact.

697
00:50:09.16 --> 00:50:12.16
The, even the way you travel like, okay, you could say, well,

698
00:50:12.16 --> 00:50:14.16
you know, we used to be able to, and I don't know how much you traveled

699
00:50:14.16 --> 00:50:15.16
before 9.11.

700
00:50:15.16 --> 00:50:17.16
I traveled a lot before 9.11.

701
00:50:17.16 --> 00:50:20.16
And, you know, it was a lot easier to travel.

702
00:50:20.16 --> 00:50:22.16
There's a lot of quicker and there was to fight.

703
00:50:22.16 --> 00:50:25.16
It's always seem to be happening, which is just the easier deal.

704
00:50:25.16 --> 00:50:26.16
Yeah.

705
00:50:26.16 --> 00:50:29.16
But now, TSA's dialed in enough when you get used to the program

706
00:50:29.16 --> 00:50:31.16
and whatever, it's not that big of a deal.

707
00:50:31.16 --> 00:50:34.16
It's not like your freaking life is not a big deal.

708
00:50:34.16 --> 00:50:35.16
Yeah.

709
00:50:35.16 --> 00:50:37.16
So really, the wars that we're going through right now

710
00:50:37.16 --> 00:50:39.16
for people that are detached from them.

711
00:50:39.16 --> 00:50:40.16
So, I mean, obviously you got millions here.

712
00:50:40.16 --> 00:50:42.16
You got the families of the millions.

713
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:43.16
Sure.

714
00:50:43.16 --> 00:50:47.16
But once you step outside, you know, you step one or two degrees away from that.

715
00:50:47.16 --> 00:50:49.16
You could be living your life.

716
00:50:49.16 --> 00:50:50.16
And if you didn't see it on the news,

717
00:50:50.16 --> 00:50:52.16
you would never ever know that there was a war going on.

718
00:50:52.16 --> 00:50:53.16
Yeah.

719
00:50:53.16 --> 00:50:57.16
And that's, and what from, I think the reason he wrote that

720
00:50:57.16 --> 00:50:59.16
was because that's talking about now from the perspective of like,

721
00:50:59.16 --> 00:51:01.16
when you're in the war, you're thinking about those people that

722
00:51:01.16 --> 00:51:03.16
they're not even, they're not even affecting them.

723
00:51:03.16 --> 00:51:06.16
Occasionally, watch the news and go, oh, there was someone else

724
00:51:06.16 --> 00:51:07.16
who was killed.

725
00:51:07.16 --> 00:51:09.16
Okay, can I get, can you pass the mayonnaise?

726
00:51:09.16 --> 00:51:10.16
Yeah.

727
00:51:10.16 --> 00:51:13.16
And even, oh, like, if you're not engaged in it, it's like, you know,

728
00:51:13.16 --> 00:51:16.16
just how you say when you only when you're watching the news,

729
00:51:16.16 --> 00:51:17.16
that's when you see it.

730
00:51:17.16 --> 00:51:20.16
And even now, like when you watch the news, you're like, oh, wow,

731
00:51:20.16 --> 00:51:22.16
you know, that's, that's too bad that's happening.

732
00:51:22.16 --> 00:51:24.16
Literally the moment the news goes off.

733
00:51:24.16 --> 00:51:25.16
And I'm not talking about the war stuff.

734
00:51:25.16 --> 00:51:27.16
I'm talking about everything the news really.

735
00:51:27.16 --> 00:51:29.16
Because, you know, I don't know, car accident or something.

736
00:51:29.16 --> 00:51:32.16
Well, the news is like, it's getting so ridiculous right now.

737
00:51:32.16 --> 00:51:34.16
The news cycles completely ridiculous right now.

738
00:51:34.16 --> 00:51:39.16
And it's no big surprise that why people listen to this podcast,

739
00:51:39.16 --> 00:51:43.16
why people are listening to all podcasts, why people are watching YouTube

740
00:51:43.16 --> 00:51:46.16
videos that are two and three and four hours long.

741
00:51:46.16 --> 00:51:47.16
Why is that?

742
00:51:47.16 --> 00:51:50.16
Because they want to have a little bit more depth to what they're hearing.

743
00:51:50.16 --> 00:51:51.16
I was on the airplane.

744
00:51:51.16 --> 00:51:54.16
I got done, you know, they make you put away your computer.

745
00:51:54.16 --> 00:52:00.16
And so I turned on the news because it had streaming cable news.

746
00:52:00.16 --> 00:52:02.16
And I turned it on.

747
00:52:02.16 --> 00:52:05.16
And I mean, I'm going, when do they turn on, when do they make you put away

748
00:52:05.16 --> 00:52:06.16
your computer 20 minutes?

749
00:52:06.16 --> 00:52:07.16
I had 20 minutes left.

750
00:52:07.16 --> 00:52:12.16
And in that 20 minutes, there was like three or two sections of commercials.

751
00:52:12.16 --> 00:52:15.16
Actually, there might have been three sections of commercials that are all like four

752
00:52:15.16 --> 00:52:16.16
minutes long.

753
00:52:16.16 --> 00:52:17.16
I was getting so mad.

754
00:52:17.16 --> 00:52:20.16
I'm thinking myself, I'm thinking myself, bro, I just want to know what's

755
00:52:20.16 --> 00:52:21.16
happening.

756
00:52:21.16 --> 00:52:24.16
And you got to show me another commercial about some mattress company

757
00:52:24.16 --> 00:52:27.16
or what I mean just just trying to sell me stuff.

758
00:52:27.16 --> 00:52:29.16
And then it goes back to the coverage, right?

759
00:52:29.16 --> 00:52:33.16
You go back to the coverage and the coverage is people yelling at each other.

760
00:52:33.16 --> 00:52:35.16
There's no conversation happening.

761
00:52:35.16 --> 00:52:40.16
It's, it's, it's, and I've done, you know, I've done plenty of news, bits,

762
00:52:40.16 --> 00:52:42.16
bites, whatever it's called.

763
00:52:42.16 --> 00:52:45.16
And you compared to a podcast.

764
00:52:45.16 --> 00:52:46.16
It's a joke.

765
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:47.16
It's like jokes.

766
00:52:47.16 --> 00:52:48.16
It's literally nothing.

767
00:52:48.16 --> 00:52:52.16
That's why that's why you know, Elon Musk going on a Joe Rogan and talking for three

768
00:52:52.16 --> 00:52:53.16
hours.

769
00:52:53.16 --> 00:52:56.16
You know, that's a whole different story.

770
00:52:56.16 --> 00:52:57.16
That's a whole different thing.

771
00:52:57.16 --> 00:53:00.16
And I, you know, I kind of think that's the beginning.

772
00:53:00.16 --> 00:53:05.16
That's sort of, it's the beginning of the end.

773
00:53:05.16 --> 00:53:08.16
And some stuff and the starting of some other stuff.

774
00:53:08.16 --> 00:53:13.16
But that when you, when you just can turn on the news and it's, and it's over

775
00:53:13.16 --> 00:53:18.16
that quickly and it doesn't bring you anything other than literally the headline.

776
00:53:18.16 --> 00:53:22.16
It's just the headline, which a lot of times is misleading on.

777
00:53:22.16 --> 00:53:25.16
Which is, yeah, which is, is clickbait often, right?

778
00:53:25.16 --> 00:53:26.16
It's clickbait.

779
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:28.16
It's your cell phone killing you.

780
00:53:28.16 --> 00:53:30.16
They're not saying the cell, you're so cool.

781
00:53:30.16 --> 00:53:31.16
Kill you, but is it?

782
00:53:31.16 --> 00:53:32.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:53:32.16 --> 00:53:35.16
But now I got to know when I got to click on that thing.

784
00:53:35.16 --> 00:53:36.16
Yeah, yeah.

785
00:53:36.16 --> 00:53:41.16
So now it is that's even, you could say that's probably even worse because

786
00:53:41.16 --> 00:53:45.16
there's so many good and plus not to mention back then, if you were going to watch,

787
00:53:45.16 --> 00:53:49.16
you know, my dad was telling me this the other day that back in the,

788
00:53:49.16 --> 00:53:56.16
I said, bro, I'm going to do, they had a, you know, everyone watched, like he just mentioned,

789
00:53:56.16 --> 00:53:59.16
he mentioned a Walter Crankite in this and like my dad was like,

790
00:53:59.16 --> 00:54:01.16
everyone watched Walter Crankite.

791
00:54:01.16 --> 00:54:05.16
So everyone had a base common theme of discussion.

792
00:54:05.16 --> 00:54:10.16
So when you went to work on Thursday, everyone had watched the news on Wednesday,

793
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:12.16
everyone saw the same news.

794
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:13.16
Yeah.

795
00:54:13.16 --> 00:54:17.16
And nowadays, so if you wanted to watch TV, you were going to watch that.

796
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:21.16
I mean, I remember Walter Crankite, you know, that was my dad,

797
00:54:21.16 --> 00:54:22.16
that's what was on that.

798
00:54:22.16 --> 00:54:26.16
You watched Walter Crankite, that was just, that was just how.

799
00:54:26.16 --> 00:54:31.16
And now you can go home and never watch the news.

800
00:54:31.16 --> 00:54:34.16
So you can be completely, you know, not only, you know, it's one thing to say,

801
00:54:34.16 --> 00:54:38.16
hey, the news is over about the war in 30 seconds and I don't think about it anymore.

802
00:54:38.16 --> 00:54:39.16
You can just never even watch it.

803
00:54:39.16 --> 00:54:44.16
You can just watch Instagram videos of car crashes or or,

804
00:54:44.16 --> 00:54:48.16
or one of the dumb stuff you watch on on Instagram,

805
00:54:48.16 --> 00:54:49.16
the junk girl fails.

806
00:54:49.16 --> 00:54:50.16
Drunk girl fails.

807
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:53.16
Yeah, let's watch 30, what, what, what, what, I've got, you know, an extra half an hour.

808
00:54:53.16 --> 00:54:56.16
I'll watch a half an hour with a drunk girl's fails.

809
00:54:56.16 --> 00:54:59.16
And they're, and they're funny and they're entertaining.

810
00:54:59.16 --> 00:55:03.16
And they, what part of the mind do they stimulate?

811
00:55:03.16 --> 00:55:05.16
Because they must stimulate some part of your brain.

812
00:55:05.16 --> 00:55:05.16
Yeah.

813
00:55:05.16 --> 00:55:09.16
Because they, when you watch car crashes, you know,

814
00:55:09.16 --> 00:55:11.16
and now I was going to throw street fights in there,

815
00:55:11.16 --> 00:55:14.16
but when I watch street fights, I'm actually picking them apart.

816
00:55:14.16 --> 00:55:15.16
Right?

817
00:55:15.16 --> 00:55:16.16
I'm actually trying to learn something.

818
00:55:16.16 --> 00:55:17.16
Yeah.

819
00:55:17.16 --> 00:55:20.16
And, but, you know, drunk girl's fake, drunk girl fails.

820
00:55:20.16 --> 00:55:22.16
Those, you don't learn a lot from.

821
00:55:22.16 --> 00:55:23.16
Yeah.

822
00:55:23.16 --> 00:55:26.16
I, I've shown my daughter's drunk girl fails.

823
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:29.16
Like when they were 13, 14 years old and be like,

824
00:55:29.16 --> 00:55:32.16
oh, this is what alcohol will get you.

825
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:33.16
Yeah.

826
00:55:33.16 --> 00:55:35.16
And, and the other thing for a while,

827
00:55:35.16 --> 00:55:38.16
they were showing binge drinking in England.

828
00:55:38.16 --> 00:55:39.16
Oh, yeah.

829
00:55:39.16 --> 00:55:42.16
And, you know, it was actually in the news a little bit.

830
00:55:42.16 --> 00:55:45.16
And it would just be, you know, men and women,

831
00:55:45.16 --> 00:55:47.16
but I'd show my daughters the women of just girls

832
00:55:47.16 --> 00:55:50.16
just completely, passed out drunk,

833
00:55:50.16 --> 00:55:52.16
skirk hanging open.

834
00:55:52.16 --> 00:55:54.16
I mean, just puk all over themselves.

835
00:55:54.16 --> 00:55:56.16
And I'm like, hey, this is drinking.

836
00:55:56.16 --> 00:55:57.16
This is alcohol.

837
00:55:57.16 --> 00:55:59.16
This is, this is what your little friends

838
00:55:59.16 --> 00:56:01.16
are to getting all excited about and think it's so cool.

839
00:56:01.16 --> 00:56:02.16
This is it.

840
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:06.16
This is what it gets you.

841
00:56:06.16 --> 00:56:07.16
Puk.

842
00:56:07.16 --> 00:56:09.16
So, yeah.

843
00:56:09.16 --> 00:56:10.16
Good, good tool.

844
00:56:10.16 --> 00:56:12.16
So, you can totally avoid.

845
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:16.16
You can basically customize your information flow

846
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:19.16
into your brain to whatever you want.

847
00:56:19.16 --> 00:56:20.16
Yeah.

848
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:23.16
And I'll go one step further and tell you that the algorithms

849
00:56:23.16 --> 00:56:26.16
that YouTube is putting ahead of you in front of you.

850
00:56:26.16 --> 00:56:29.16
So, when you get done watching one YouTube video of a drunk girl fail,

851
00:56:29.16 --> 00:56:32.16
what pops up nine more drunk girl fails.

852
00:56:32.16 --> 00:56:33.16
Yep.

853
00:56:33.16 --> 00:56:34.16
That's right.

854
00:56:34.16 --> 00:56:35.16
That's right.

855
00:56:35.16 --> 00:56:39.16
Now, the algorithm that's actually going to just lead you to stupidity.

856
00:56:39.16 --> 00:56:40.16
Yeah.

857
00:56:40.16 --> 00:56:41.16
Right?

858
00:56:41.16 --> 00:56:42.16
They should put instead of putting advertising,

859
00:56:42.16 --> 00:56:47.16
it says should be like, okay, for every four really dumb YouTube video you watch,

860
00:56:47.16 --> 00:56:51.16
you should have to watch at least one quarter of that compiled time

861
00:56:51.16 --> 00:56:55.16
into something that's going to teach you something about being a better human being.

862
00:56:55.16 --> 00:56:56.16
Yeah.

863
00:56:56.16 --> 00:56:59.16
Well, I don't know how good a business model that would be,

864
00:56:59.16 --> 00:57:03.16
but, you know, it's a good idea kind of in theory, I guess.

865
00:57:03.16 --> 00:57:05.16
You got to get beyond just thinking about money echo tross.

866
00:57:05.16 --> 00:57:06.16
Yeah.

867
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:07.16
I think it meant it.

868
00:57:07.16 --> 00:57:09.16
I'm not saying they shouldn't.

869
00:57:09.16 --> 00:57:10.16
I'm saying that's why they won't.

870
00:57:10.16 --> 00:57:11.16
But yeah.

871
00:57:11.16 --> 00:57:12.16
Yeah.

872
00:57:12.16 --> 00:57:12.16
Yeah.

873
00:57:12.16 --> 00:57:16.16
It's like right now because right now in this, in the, they're trying to put these limits on time,

874
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:22.16
or I think the social media people are saying, hey, we're going to help you monitor your time that you spend on social media.

875
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:24.16
So, there'll be like a little thing that pops up.

876
00:57:24.16 --> 00:57:28.16
You've spent 40 minutes on social media today.

877
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:29.16
Yeah.

878
00:57:29.16 --> 00:57:30.16
Because you're right.

879
00:57:30.16 --> 00:57:31.16
You know what they're not going to say?

880
00:57:31.16 --> 00:57:32.16
You reached your limit.

881
00:57:32.16 --> 00:57:33.16
I'm not going to say that.

882
00:57:33.16 --> 00:57:36.16
I'm not going to say, hey, you watched nine stupid videos.

883
00:57:36.16 --> 00:57:40.16
Now you're going to watch three educational ones to make you smarter.

884
00:57:40.16 --> 00:57:45.16
I mean, they're going to show you the time of your consumption.

885
00:57:45.16 --> 00:57:48.16
Right next to the next video that they made.

886
00:57:48.16 --> 00:57:49.16
Yeah.

887
00:57:49.16 --> 00:57:51.16
You like to watch, you know.

888
00:57:51.16 --> 00:57:53.16
They're going to complete your resistable tea.

889
00:57:53.16 --> 00:57:54.16
Yeah.

890
00:57:54.16 --> 00:57:55.16
That's a thing that you got to watch.

891
00:57:55.16 --> 00:57:56.16
A drunk girl failing.

892
00:57:56.16 --> 00:58:00.16
You can see her and she's like standing on the edge of whatever.

893
00:58:00.16 --> 00:58:01.16
Yeah.

894
00:58:01.16 --> 00:58:02.16
That's going to be a good one.

895
00:58:02.16 --> 00:58:07.16
Traced in like red, with exclamation park, you know, or point, you know how they do that.

896
00:58:07.16 --> 00:58:08.16
Yeah.

897
00:58:08.16 --> 00:58:09.16
It's like, oh, it's so exciting.

898
00:58:09.16 --> 00:58:10.16
I see what you're doing.

899
00:58:10.16 --> 00:58:11.16
But yeah.

900
00:58:11.16 --> 00:58:16.16
So you can be completely, the point there is you can be completely disconnected, especially

901
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:19.16
now, completely disconnected with the reality of the world.

902
00:58:19.16 --> 00:58:20.16
Yeah.

903
00:58:20.16 --> 00:58:23.16
All right.

904
00:58:23.16 --> 00:58:26.16
April 4th, 1970, Colonel S.

905
00:58:26.16 --> 00:58:31.16
Many officers and NCOs and Vietnam know their business.

906
00:58:31.16 --> 00:58:36.16
Even though they hate the war, a war not of their own making, they really take care of

907
00:58:36.16 --> 00:58:39.16
their men and don't give a damn about frontline formalities.

908
00:58:39.16 --> 00:58:43.16
All they want is to get as many of their men back alive as they can.

909
00:58:43.16 --> 00:58:47.16
The men deeply respect these officers and NCOs in justifiably so.

910
00:58:47.16 --> 00:58:48.16
So there you go.

911
00:58:48.16 --> 00:58:51.16
A little bit a little bit of leadership here.

912
00:58:51.16 --> 00:58:53.16
Take care of your men.

913
00:58:53.16 --> 00:58:54.16
Other, back to the book.

914
00:58:54.16 --> 00:59:01.16
Officers are little people with rank and authority and little else.

915
00:59:01.16 --> 00:59:04.16
They cannot command respect by their action.

916
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:07.16
So they must command by their respect verbally.

917
00:59:07.16 --> 00:59:13.16
And for petty offenses for haircuts, polished boots and frontline solutes.

918
00:59:13.16 --> 00:59:21.16
Colonel S was one of these men, a little puffy hamster man who would not hesitate to lick the

919
00:59:21.16 --> 00:59:24.16
general's boots on any occasion.

920
00:59:24.16 --> 00:59:28.16
And he had the audacity on numerous occasions to lamb-bast various troops for their sloppy

921
00:59:28.16 --> 00:59:30.16
haircuts and uniforms at the base p.x.

922
00:59:30.16 --> 00:59:34.16
Such troops had just come in from the field or from a long exhausting convoy.

923
00:59:34.16 --> 00:59:38.16
And it not seen the likes of a shower, much less a barburn or number of weeks.

924
00:59:38.16 --> 00:59:41.16
They always looked at the Colonel and total disbelief.

925
00:59:41.16 --> 00:59:48.16
And then the company ending in a long imprisoned rage for this antiseptic staff,

926
00:59:48.16 --> 00:59:51.16
toady.

927
00:59:51.16 --> 00:59:57.16
Colonel S's written directives were likewise incomprehensible, unnecessary wasteful and in a word

928
00:59:57.16 --> 01:00:00.16
unbelievably stupid.

929
01:00:00.16 --> 01:00:08.16
Many of us thought the Joseph Heller's catch-22 was an unreal parody about war until we met Colonel S.

930
01:00:08.16 --> 01:00:12.16
One night some Vietcong sappers blew up our petroleum storage dump and it was incredible.

931
01:00:12.16 --> 01:00:15.16
It was an incredible blaze for three days and nights.

932
01:00:15.16 --> 01:00:21.16
Anyway, after the immediate attack Colonel S jumped out of his Jeep, grabbed his 45 caliber pistol

933
01:00:21.16 --> 01:00:27.16
and went chasing after the VC hell-bunt for hell-bent, for musty leather, stumbling over the sand dunes

934
01:00:27.16 --> 01:00:36.16
like a long retired prop man in a John Wayne war movie, attempting a futile and embarrassing comeback.

935
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:42.16
We all sort of hope that the Vietcong would follow the logical rules of guerrilla warfare and leave one sniper back

936
01:00:42.16 --> 01:00:49.16
to cover their escape waiting for the much beloved staff Colonel to compounding over the hill.

937
01:00:49.16 --> 01:00:52.16
But no such luck.

938
01:00:52.16 --> 01:01:00.16
Apparently the VC knew all about the Colonel and wanted to leave him right where he was and who could blame them.

939
01:01:00.16 --> 01:01:02.16
So there you go.

940
01:01:02.16 --> 01:01:04.16
There's those type of people they exist now.

941
01:01:04.16 --> 01:01:05.16
They're going to exist.

942
01:01:05.16 --> 01:01:09.16
And if you're one of those people that started listening to podcasts and joined the military

943
01:01:09.16 --> 01:01:14.16
and I know there's a lot of you, get some, that's awesome.

944
01:01:14.16 --> 01:01:21.16
When you don't think that every officer you meet is going to be one of these guys that takes care of their men

945
01:01:21.16 --> 01:01:28.16
and doesn't give a damn about front line formalities and is deeply respected, that's not a majority.

946
01:01:28.16 --> 01:01:35.16
Now this other knucklehead, the guy that's licking the boots of the general, that's not a majority either.

947
01:01:35.16 --> 01:01:39.16
But they exist. They're there.

948
01:01:39.16 --> 01:01:42.16
April 9, 1970, waiting.

949
01:01:42.16 --> 01:01:48.16
Waiting is 90% of the game in Vietnam. You keep busy. You do your job 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

950
01:01:48.16 --> 01:01:55.16
Occasionally there's a half day off a stand-down or ten days of R&R outside of Vietnam.

951
01:01:55.16 --> 01:02:03.16
But the rest of the time you wait, seven days a week, 24 hours a day until things happen, you wait.

952
01:02:03.16 --> 01:02:10.16
And then when it happens you're right in the middle of it. When you're not working or sleeping, you're still waiting.

953
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:16.16
And time can play some horrible tricks on you. Vietnam may be a one-year tour for most soldiers.

954
01:02:16.16 --> 01:02:20.16
But they have actually spent many more years there than they care to talk about.

955
01:02:20.16 --> 01:02:26.16
Time and Vietnam slows down almost to a stop every minute of every day.

956
01:02:26.16 --> 01:02:33.16
The Vietnamese have lived with this phenomenon for century, but the Western soldier cannot.

957
01:02:33.16 --> 01:02:40.16
Your last two weeks in Vietnam like your first two weeks are measured in months, and you're especially paranoid about getting hit during these last two weeks.

958
01:02:40.16 --> 01:02:43.16
And you wait.

959
01:02:43.16 --> 01:02:46.16
Your off-duty time is short-lived and very precious.

960
01:02:46.16 --> 01:02:52.16
With a 24-hour day and a seven-day a week, it is the only time you have to blow off your stress and anxiety.

961
01:02:52.16 --> 01:02:59.16
Your loneliness, fear, and frustration. Sometimes you can almost, but only almost.

962
01:02:59.16 --> 01:03:01.16
Forget the war.

963
01:03:01.16 --> 01:03:05.16
During this time we grew together with our friends.

964
01:03:05.16 --> 01:03:10.16
We shared each other's hurt and pain are love and hate for home and war.

965
01:03:10.16 --> 01:03:13.16
We got to know each other in a very deep sense.

966
01:03:13.16 --> 01:03:17.16
Maybe better than our wives or girlfriends ever would.

967
01:03:17.16 --> 01:03:23.16
We talked philosophy and we talked nonsense. We laughed and we cried.

968
01:03:23.16 --> 01:03:26.16
We learned to live and grow.

969
01:03:26.16 --> 01:03:30.16
We looked back and we looked ahead.

970
01:03:30.16 --> 01:03:36.16
We talked about changes, gain us, and in America.

971
01:03:36.16 --> 01:03:40.16
We committed ourselves to both.

972
01:03:40.16 --> 01:03:44.16
Without these friends Vietnam would have been much worse than it already was,

973
01:03:44.16 --> 01:03:51.16
our friends made this waiting, bearable.

974
01:03:54.16 --> 01:04:00.16
April 11, 1970, medicine men.

975
01:04:00.16 --> 01:04:04.16
Many doctors assigned to the medical core in Vietnam

976
01:04:04.16 --> 01:04:08.16
devote much of their very limited and precious off-time duty,

977
01:04:08.16 --> 01:04:12.16
working with Vietnamese civilians, most medical assistance.

978
01:04:12.16 --> 01:04:17.16
From the other side is grateful, appreciated, but there are exceptions.

979
01:04:17.16 --> 01:04:22.16
My brother Charles, who was assigned to the 6th Comvalescent Center in Southern

980
01:04:22.16 --> 01:04:28.16
Tukor, worked with many Vietnamese civilians in Camron, Village, and my car,

981
01:04:28.16 --> 01:04:30.16
Village among others.

982
01:04:30.16 --> 01:04:33.16
But three weeks after end, his tour of Doudin Vietnam,

983
01:04:33.16 --> 01:04:36.16
a small group of Viet Kong sappers blew up his hospital,

984
01:04:36.16 --> 01:04:40.16
killing and wounding 98 bed-ridden patients.

985
01:04:40.16 --> 01:04:45.16
Another army doctor working a small village not far from Camron Bay

986
01:04:45.16 --> 01:04:49.16
successfully saved the life of a young girl, 12 years old,

987
01:04:49.16 --> 01:04:52.16
who had both of her hands blown off by a grenade.

988
01:04:52.16 --> 01:04:56.16
The little girl's grandmother was also injured in the blast.

989
01:04:56.16 --> 01:05:01.16
A short while later, the doctor learned that the young girl's injuries,

990
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:06.16
occurred while she and her grandmother, had been attempting to booby-trap

991
01:05:06.16 --> 01:05:11.16
the doctor's own Jeep with this same grenade, hoping to kill him when he started his engine.

992
01:05:11.16 --> 01:05:19.16
A third unarmed American medic spent much of his free time in a similar village,

993
01:05:19.16 --> 01:05:24.16
attempting to fight an outbreak of cholera and typhoid.

994
01:05:24.16 --> 01:05:29.16
One young Vietnamese boy was too sick to be saved when the medic arrived in the village,

995
01:05:29.16 --> 01:05:33.16
but rumors circulated throughout the Hamlet that the American medic was responsible

996
01:05:33.16 --> 01:05:38.16
for killing the boy with his poisonous medicine.

997
01:05:38.16 --> 01:05:43.16
Consequently, the village allowed two Viet Kong snipers to ambush and kill the young medic

998
01:05:43.16 --> 01:05:46.16
when he drove back into the village a few days later,

999
01:05:46.16 --> 01:05:49.16
with another shipment of life-saving drugs.

1000
01:05:49.16 --> 01:05:54.16
Few medical personnel dared to enter this village after the episode,

1001
01:05:54.16 --> 01:06:00.16
and half the villagers later died as a result of cholera epidemic.

1002
01:06:00.16 --> 01:06:17.16
Yeah, this is, you know, it was really, last night I was actually reading an interview with David Hackworth

1003
01:06:17.16 --> 01:06:23.16
that I read it before, but I was reading it again, and one of the things he said was that

1004
01:06:23.16 --> 01:06:27.16
the goal, because we dropped, he's going through the numbers, and I'll do this.

1005
01:06:27.16 --> 01:06:31.16
Interview on the podcast, I'll bring it in, and, but he was saying he's talking about how much

1006
01:06:31.16 --> 01:06:35.16
bombs we dropped on Vietnam. So Vietnam's about the size of California,

1007
01:06:35.16 --> 01:06:39.16
and we dropped more bombs in Vietnam.

1008
01:06:39.16 --> 01:06:46.16
Then got dropped in all of Europe during World War II on both sides.

1009
01:06:46.16 --> 01:06:54.16
So both the allies and the axis all bombs put together during all of World War II

1010
01:06:54.16 --> 01:07:00.16
in all that area, there was more dropped into just Vietnam.

1011
01:07:00.16 --> 01:07:04.16
And what someone said was, you know, he's quoting a general that said,

1012
01:07:04.16 --> 01:07:09.16
hey, we're going to bomb them back into the Stone Age, and what he didn't realize is that they were already

1013
01:07:09.16 --> 01:07:15.16
wearing the Stone Age. These people are living their farmers. They're working, they're basically in the Stone Age.

1014
01:07:15.16 --> 01:07:20.16
And so that's, my point is that they're not going to understand this medical treatment,

1015
01:07:20.16 --> 01:07:27.16
and if someone comes in and starts manipulating their brains and saying, oh, that kid was killed by this poisonous medicine.

1016
01:07:27.16 --> 01:07:28.16
Hmm.

1017
01:07:33.16 --> 01:07:41.16
April 15th, 1970, a short short story. Once upon a time there was a politician who, all by himself,

1018
01:07:41.16 --> 01:07:46.16
blustered and stormed and committed half a million young men to risk their lives in war.

1019
01:07:46.16 --> 01:07:52.16
Some fat asked power hungry politician who, in all his potato-face ugliness,

1020
01:07:52.16 --> 01:07:58.16
had the gall to consider himself a statesman and a man of decision.

1021
01:07:58.16 --> 01:08:09.16
The American sheep went bah, bah, and the young boys died, and bulb knows lived happily ever after.

1022
01:08:09.16 --> 01:08:13.16
Kirkmeyer, Lee,

1023
01:08:13.16 --> 01:08:20.16
Kothrin, Daily, Rod Riggas,

1024
01:08:20.16 --> 01:08:26.16
Just names, just figures.

1025
01:08:30.16 --> 01:08:35.16
April 19th, 1970, officers and men.

1026
01:08:35.16 --> 01:08:41.16
American soldiers in Vietnam came from all walks of life and so did the officers.

1027
01:08:41.16 --> 01:08:49.16
Most of the officers I worked with in Vietnam, in Saigon, Camron, Notrang, were citizen soldiers like I was.

1028
01:08:49.16 --> 01:08:53.16
Graduates of ROTC or OCS.

1029
01:08:53.16 --> 01:08:59.16
Only Colonel S, Major T, and Captain D were West Point graduates.

1030
01:08:59.16 --> 01:09:03.16
Colonel S is discussed elsewhere in this book.

1031
01:09:03.16 --> 01:09:11.16
Captain D didn't like going along with anyone, and Major T was a good officer well liked and much respected.

1032
01:09:11.16 --> 01:09:14.16
One out of three ain't bad.

1033
01:09:14.16 --> 01:09:20.16
For six months, my superior officer was Major P from the 173rd Airborne,

1034
01:09:20.16 --> 01:09:24.16
and I couldn't have worked for a better man in route of the army.

1035
01:09:24.16 --> 01:09:31.16
He treated us all like human beings no matter what our rank was, and we were all fiercely loyal in return.

1036
01:09:31.16 --> 01:09:33.16
Hey, there's a novel idea.

1037
01:09:33.16 --> 01:09:35.16
That's a novel idea.

1038
01:09:35.16 --> 01:09:38.16
All these people that asked me, like, oh, I'm taking over leadership position.

1039
01:09:38.16 --> 01:09:39.16
What should I do?

1040
01:09:39.16 --> 01:09:43.16
Here's step one, treat your people like human beings no matter what their rank are.

1041
01:09:43.16 --> 01:09:48.16
And look, he says that people were fiercely loyal in return.

1042
01:09:48.16 --> 01:09:53.16
When Major P left, however, we became expendable to the greater glories of someone else.

1043
01:09:53.16 --> 01:10:00.16
The army, like any civilian counterpart, has its equal share of the good, the bad, and the ugly.

1044
01:10:00.16 --> 01:10:06.16
One of my closest friends in Vietnam was none of the above.

1045
01:10:06.16 --> 01:10:12.16
He was a Steve Dor officer, a Pentecostal minister's son, and Zorba, the Greek.

1046
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:17.16
He treated his men as individuals, rankless, and unique.

1047
01:10:17.16 --> 01:10:21.16
They did their job with a minimum of hassle, and they loved him.

1048
01:10:21.16 --> 01:10:26.16
He was their counselor, their friend, and their equal.

1049
01:10:26.16 --> 01:10:34.16
When he was about to leave Vietnam, his men gave him a symbolic, christening, and beer, and threw him in the ocean.

1050
01:10:34.16 --> 01:10:41.16
He told them to treat each other just like you'd want the other dude to treat you.

1051
01:10:41.16 --> 01:10:50.16
The golden rule in a tub full of beer, an inner light forever branching outward.

1052
01:10:50.16 --> 01:11:00.16
In Vietnam, when most of us were plotting through the absurd in human procedures of the war, he alone remained a man of substance.

1053
01:11:00.16 --> 01:11:05.16
So again, it's like treat your people well.

1054
01:11:05.16 --> 01:11:11.16
April 27, 1970, a highway accident.

1055
01:11:11.16 --> 01:11:19.16
Yesterday, we saw the results of what happens when a small lamb breada, scuder bus, filled with 12 Vietnamese civilians,

1056
01:11:19.16 --> 01:11:24.16
hits a veet-cong-mind buried along the side of the main highway.

1057
01:11:24.16 --> 01:11:37.16
The mine was primarily an anti-personel device, used as the military abstractly explains it, their harass the civilian population.

1058
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:41.16
There were a lot of mangled bodies lying there.

1059
01:11:41.16 --> 01:11:53.16
Until they were police-up, primarily older people, women and children, the elder sons and husbands had already been conscripted to take their chances on the conventional battlefield.

1060
01:11:53.16 --> 01:12:02.16
In America, a big highway accident or related disaster usually draws a huge morbid crowd to stare and gawk.

1061
01:12:02.16 --> 01:12:11.16
Yesterday, in Vietnam, no one seemed to notice.

1062
01:12:11.16 --> 01:12:21.16
April 30, 1970, the Koreans, the Koreans, fielded in excess of two cracked divisions during the Vietnam war.

1063
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:29.16
The rock, that's Republic of Korea, the rock troops were greatly feared and respected by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese alike.

1064
01:12:29.16 --> 01:12:34.16
They asked for and gave little quarter to the communists.

1065
01:12:34.16 --> 01:12:44.16
Once, when one of their troops was ambushed outside a small village in Northern Tukor, the Koreans hunted the sniper down, brought him back to the village,

1066
01:12:44.16 --> 01:12:49.16
strong them up on a tree and skinned him alive.

1067
01:12:49.16 --> 01:12:56.16
The Koreans bravery, devotion and ferocity as a fighting force was legendary in Vietnam.

1068
01:12:56.16 --> 01:13:09.16
During the Ted offensive of 1968, every major allied headquarters and military compound in all of Vietnam was attacked by the communists except one.

1069
01:13:09.16 --> 01:13:15.16
The VC and the North Vietnamese gave wide birth to the Koreans.

1070
01:13:15.16 --> 01:13:20.16
I did not know that, but that's legit.

1071
01:13:20.16 --> 01:13:26.16
They said, yeah, we're not going to attack the Korean compound.

1072
01:13:26.16 --> 01:13:28.16
We're going to leave it alone.

1073
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:33.16
So, there is that speaks volumes.

1074
01:13:33.16 --> 01:13:35.16
That speaks volumes.

1075
01:13:35.16 --> 01:13:44.16
That's why, yeah, you got to carry a big stick.

1076
01:13:44.16 --> 01:13:51.16
I've got to carry a big stick, perhaps the Koreans.

1077
01:13:51.16 --> 01:13:54.16
Here's a little poem in memory of a friend killed in action.

1078
01:13:54.16 --> 01:14:00.16
Is it weakness for a strong man to be moved by inner touch?

1079
01:14:00.16 --> 01:14:06.16
Must he spurn a lonely blade of grass and dam the oceans roar?

1080
01:14:06.16 --> 01:14:13.16
Or must he look at sentimental beauty as a crutch and choose to play the game of pride by calling life a whole.

1081
01:14:13.16 --> 01:14:18.16
No.

1082
01:14:18.16 --> 01:14:29.16
I have seen the strongest man defend a withered rose and fall from grace because the people didn't understand.

1083
01:14:29.16 --> 01:14:36.16
They thought it was his weakness, they exploited, I suppose, and killing him in ignorance.

1084
01:14:36.16 --> 01:14:41.16
They trembled in his hand.

1085
01:14:41.16 --> 01:14:46.16
May 25, 1970, Kent State.

1086
01:14:46.16 --> 01:15:01.16
In the futility and rage over President Nixon's Cambodian invasion, the killing of four student demonstrators at Kent State University by the Ohio National Guard mystified many GIs and Vietnam.

1087
01:15:01.16 --> 01:15:10.16
We felt this outrage too, but we had a hard time comprehending how the press and the nation could make so much of an issue out of these four people.

1088
01:15:10.16 --> 01:15:20.16
We were losing friends and comrades in an average of 250 men killed each and every week.

1089
01:15:20.16 --> 01:15:30.16
It made us feel as unwilling participants that we were a subhuman species neglected and alone.

1090
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:35.16
Forgotten pawns in a confused and God forsaken war.

1091
01:15:35.16 --> 01:15:44.16
And we were on both sides of the ocean.

1092
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:55.16
Yeah, I mean, obviously growing up, you actually study, like when I went to history class in high school,

1093
01:15:55.16 --> 01:16:09.16
like we specifically learned about the Kent State massacre, which obviously is horrible, but can you imagine, so for these students could kill these student protesters, obviously never should have happened.

1094
01:16:09.16 --> 01:16:18.16
But can you imagine being a Vietnam in the whole country of America is up in arms about these four students being killed.

1095
01:16:18.16 --> 01:16:26.16
And every week there's 250 of your friends getting killed.

1096
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:36.16
May 26, 1970, the real heroes, the medics and metavac personnel in Vietnam almost to a man were beautiful and very dedicated people,

1097
01:16:36.16 --> 01:16:49.16
braving the fiercest fire and most horrowing odds to comfort and evacuate the wounded and dying, military and civilian alike, often from both sides from the heat of battle.

1098
01:16:49.16 --> 01:17:01.16
In any war, the real heroes are those who try to maintain basic humanity, time and time again risking their own lives so that others might live.

1099
01:17:01.16 --> 01:17:11.16
In Vietnam, the medics and metavac people were such men.

1100
01:17:11.16 --> 01:17:15.16
May 28, 1970, anti-war protesters.

1101
01:17:15.16 --> 01:17:21.16
There were various reactions by Vietnam, GIs, to the anti-war protesters back home.

1102
01:17:21.16 --> 01:17:33.16
The bulk of the infantry were high school graduates who knew that college deferments kept most of the more affluent anti-war protesters out of the draft and thus out of the war.

1103
01:17:33.16 --> 01:17:43.16
To these GIs, Vietnam was viewed in terms of a deep gut reaction, a sort of misery-loves company affair.

1104
01:17:43.16 --> 01:17:54.16
I wish those goddamn protesters could be over here for one week and see what the VC did to my buddy. It changed their goddamn mind real quick.

1105
01:17:54.16 --> 01:17:59.16
That was he had that in quotes that wasn't him. That was him.

1106
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:07.16
That was him explaining what the thoughts of the average infantry GIs was.

1107
01:18:07.16 --> 01:18:15.16
Back to the book, some of our contemporaries had chosen jail or candidate in Sweden. We had chosen Vietnam.

1108
01:18:15.16 --> 01:18:23.16
At least the anti-war protesters could show the world that we were all not supporting the president's actions, even at war.

1109
01:18:23.16 --> 01:18:35.16
On the other hand, we had to survive this war. Since the VC and the North Vietnamese had designs for killing us and we had designs on them, we were both de facto enemies.

1110
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:43.16
Nevertheless, most Vietnam GIs and the anti-war protesters back home had something in common.

1111
01:18:43.16 --> 01:18:53.16
I love this, this right here is awesome. The frontline troops hated the war, and they hated the safer combat support personnel.

1112
01:18:53.16 --> 01:18:59.16
The combat support personnel hated the war and they hated the organizational general staff.

1113
01:18:59.16 --> 01:19:05.16
The staff personnel hated the war and they hated the troops back in Europe and the troops back home.

1114
01:19:05.16 --> 01:19:12.16
The troops back home hated the war and they hated the placid non-carrying American civilians.

1115
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:19.16
The American civilians supported the war at the time and they hated the anti-war protesters.

1116
01:19:19.16 --> 01:19:25.16
And the anti-war protesters hated the war and they hated the government.

1117
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:33.16
Therefore, the protesters and the soldiers that like had one important thing in common, we both hated the war.

1118
01:19:33.16 --> 01:19:37.16
That's a crazy thing to think about that whole thing.

1119
01:19:37.16 --> 01:19:47.16
It's just like, it's, ah, you could play those kind of circular games with our political system all day long right now.

1120
01:19:47.16 --> 01:19:49.16
Ridiculous.

1121
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:59.16
This overall feeling perhaps can only be described by a related story as the American troop withdrawals in Vietnam began

1122
01:19:59.16 --> 01:20:05.16
An armored outfit, the two-one calf pulled into Camron Bay for its long-awaited departure home.

1123
01:20:05.16 --> 01:20:15.16
Over four years, the two-one calf had performed a combat and combat support role in and around fan rang and fan jet.

1124
01:20:15.16 --> 01:20:22.16
They had eaten dust and mud, been shot at, mordered, and booby-trap throughout their tour, and now they were going home.

1125
01:20:22.16 --> 01:20:32.16
To honor these brave and gallant men, General D of the Camron Support Command decided to give them a fitting welcome home of mid-banners, bands, and flags.

1126
01:20:32.16 --> 01:20:36.16
General D himself was on the reviewing stand.

1127
01:20:36.16 --> 01:20:47.16
And just as the overly tired men of the two-one calf rumbled by in their tanks and armored personnel carriers, the general proudly saluted them.

1128
01:20:47.16 --> 01:20:53.16
The first man in the lead tank, not knowing it was a general saluting him, or just not carrying,

1129
01:20:53.16 --> 01:20:58.16
returned the general snappy salute in the only way possible.

1130
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:01.16
He gave him the finger.

1131
01:21:01.16 --> 01:21:09.16
June 6, 1970, coming home.

1132
01:21:09.16 --> 01:21:17.16
Coming home, we had to go through American customs, sort of like weary tourists back from a year-long overseas job to the enchanted east.

1133
01:21:17.16 --> 01:21:19.16
Did we have anything to declare?

1134
01:21:19.16 --> 01:21:20.16
Not much.

1135
01:21:20.16 --> 01:21:24.16
Most of our prized PX positions, possessions were shipped home.

1136
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:29.16
Some having been ripped off by certain civilian steve doors, but along the coast.

1137
01:21:29.16 --> 01:21:32.16
So now he is...

1138
01:21:32.16 --> 01:21:37.16
He's home June 7, 1974, Lewis Washington.

1139
01:21:37.16 --> 01:21:42.16
A big monster idiot tube welcomed us back to the world.

1140
01:21:42.16 --> 01:21:54.16
A third-rate TV comedy in the sweaty lounge with grotesque absurd commercials, screaming and clawing at their days to viewers with a never-ending by me, fervor.

1141
01:21:54.16 --> 01:22:01.16
I'm sorry, I said as I turned the monster off, I'm just not ready for all this yet.

1142
01:22:01.16 --> 01:22:10.16
I know what you mean, another voice said, spending a whole year overseas fighting to defend all this crap.

1143
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:20.16
So there you go, the TV, the TV, the monster clawing at its viewers.

1144
01:22:20.16 --> 01:22:24.16
Bye, me, bye, me, you.

1145
01:22:24.16 --> 01:22:28.16
May 5, 1971, a March and San Francisco.

1146
01:22:28.16 --> 01:22:36.16
There was a huge anti-war protest march in San Francisco this week, over 700,000 people, walked down Giri Street.

1147
01:22:36.16 --> 01:22:47.16
And in memory of some friends, we found ourselves in front of a long, large contingent of old timers from the Lincoln Brigade, and directly behind a large group of businessmen against the war.

1148
01:22:47.16 --> 01:23:04.16
There were students in veterans housewives with baby prams, burly steve doors and electricians, grandmothers and grandchildren, policemen and hippies, minorities and majorities, all Americans peacefully asserting their constitutional right of free speech and assembly.

1149
01:23:04.16 --> 01:23:16.16
After the speeches in Golden Gate Park, one badly crippled veteran in a wheelchair had just enough strength to hurl some hard-were, one combat medals into the field, a bronze star medal,

1150
01:23:16.16 --> 01:23:20.16
and two purple hearts.

1151
01:23:20.16 --> 01:23:34.16
Nobody cared about us when they sent us over there, he said, and nobody cares about us now.

1152
01:23:34.16 --> 01:23:45.16
And that kind of closes out the portion of the book that I want to cover, although I do want to actually finish it with a

1153
01:23:45.16 --> 01:24:00.16
what he finishes or how he finishes the book and he finishes the book, Peter and Swisher finishes the book with a quote from someone else.

1154
01:24:00.16 --> 01:24:07.16
And that's how he finishes the book, so I want to read that.

1155
01:24:07.16 --> 01:24:17.16
And it says to close out the book, it's called Another Time Another Place.

1156
01:24:17.16 --> 01:24:28.16
This morning, January 21st, another picture of war was the worst I have ever seen.

1157
01:24:28.16 --> 01:24:41.16
It is just east of where the engineers have established a fairy crossing across the river, at a point where the river first bends toward the road.

1158
01:24:41.16 --> 01:24:49.16
Until they were buried, their lay, what was left of eight or ten British soldiers.

1159
01:24:49.16 --> 01:25:01.16
Perhaps one of their mortars was hit as some were burned, and there had been a heavy explosion, but no shell crater was seen nearby.

1160
01:25:01.16 --> 01:25:06.16
Of two men, only the lower half remained.

1161
01:25:06.16 --> 01:25:15.16
Another two were each lacking a head, and another had a leg off at the hip.

1162
01:25:15.16 --> 01:25:21.16
All had been horribly injured.

1163
01:25:21.16 --> 01:25:38.16
A Christmas card lay on the ground, bearing the words in a child's hand writing to the best daddy in the world.

1164
01:25:38.16 --> 01:25:55.16
And those words were written by somebody by the name of Captain George Nash, Royal Artillery, Italy, 1944.

1165
01:25:55.16 --> 01:26:07.16
And if you put this together, Peter and Swisher, the end in his name, stands for Nash.

1166
01:26:07.16 --> 01:26:33.16
Because Captain George Nash was Peter Swisher's biological father, who I talked about in the beginning, who was killed after the war as he came home from Italy.

1167
01:26:33.16 --> 01:26:40.16
Another place, another time.

1168
01:26:40.16 --> 01:26:54.16
You know, life in many ways, in so many different ways, we are not going to understand it.

1169
01:26:54.16 --> 01:26:56.16
It's incomprehensible.

1170
01:26:56.16 --> 01:27:14.16
I mean, when you get this Christmas card laying on the ground amongst these savagely wounded soldiers, and that this Christmas card says, in little kids writing to the best daddy in the world.

1171
01:27:14.16 --> 01:27:22.16
I don't understand that.

1172
01:27:22.16 --> 01:27:29.16
That is, no, why the world can be such a horrific place.

1173
01:27:29.16 --> 01:27:35.16
And how life can be so tragic, but that is the way it is.

1174
01:27:35.16 --> 01:27:47.16
And some of the things that happen in the world, they just happen in what we cannot control them.

1175
01:27:47.16 --> 01:27:57.16
But at the same time, there are so many things in the world that we do control.

1176
01:27:57.16 --> 01:28:13.16
And all of us, all of us, we all can somehow, in some way, relieve, or we can attenuate some of that tragedy.

1177
01:28:13.16 --> 01:28:21.16
We don't need to spur an alonely blade of grass or damn the oceans roar.

1178
01:28:21.16 --> 01:28:26.16
We don't need to do that.

1179
01:28:26.16 --> 01:28:28.16
We can make someone's life a little bit better.

1180
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:39.16
We can make ourselves a little bit better, and in doing so, we can make the world, even just a small part of the world a little bit better.

1181
01:28:39.16 --> 01:28:47.16
And Peter Swisher, he actually did survive Vietnam, and he went on to become a lawyer, and then he became a professor of law at the University of Richmond.

1182
01:28:47.16 --> 01:29:00.16
And he was married for 37 years and raised a daughter, and any died June 15th, 2016.

1183
01:29:00.16 --> 01:29:22.16
A cancer, a cancer called multiple Myeloma, which if you don't know what that is, that's one of the forms of cancer that's connected to, to Agent Orange, which is the chemical that we used in Vietnam to kill the foliage.

1184
01:29:22.16 --> 01:29:29.16
So the enemy could not admit.

1185
01:29:29.16 --> 01:29:35.16
And that's the cancer that killed Peter Nash, Swisher.

1186
01:29:35.16 --> 01:29:46.16
But luckily his voice and his memories live on with us through his writing and through his stories.

1187
01:29:46.16 --> 01:29:58.16
And I think through these stories, he left the world a little bit of a better place.

1188
01:29:58.16 --> 01:30:06.16
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1189
01:30:06.16 --> 01:30:11.16
So echo.

1190
01:30:11.16 --> 01:30:21.16
Maybe you could let me decompress a little bit, and maybe tell us how we can help us.

1191
01:30:21.16 --> 01:30:24.16
Make the world a better place.

1192
01:30:24.16 --> 01:30:28.16
That sounds like a big deal.

1193
01:30:28.16 --> 01:30:32.16
But is it really that big of a deal?

1194
01:30:32.16 --> 01:30:36.16
Well, I'm not talking about you personally got to individually go out and change the whole world.

1195
01:30:36.16 --> 01:30:37.16
Right.

1196
01:30:37.16 --> 01:30:38.16
And the way that everyone can see right now.

1197
01:30:38.16 --> 01:30:42.16
I had a conversation with who was I talking to.

1198
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:45.16
Someone was asking me, it might have been Pete.

1199
01:30:45.16 --> 01:30:48.16
It might have been Pete up at Origin, might have been Peter Roberts.

1200
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:52.16
It might have been him, but somebody was asking me, you know,

1201
01:30:52.16 --> 01:30:59.16
about, you know, coming up in the sealed teams and when I decided to become an officer.

1202
01:30:59.16 --> 01:31:06.16
And I'm going to set this before on here, I don't know, but you know, I had a platoon commander that was a prioriless a guy and he was awesome.

1203
01:31:06.16 --> 01:31:07.16
And we all loved him.

1204
01:31:07.16 --> 01:31:10.16
And when you're in a sealed platoon, that's the whole world.

1205
01:31:10.16 --> 01:31:11.16
Yes.

1206
01:31:11.16 --> 01:31:12.16
That's the whole world.

1207
01:31:12.16 --> 01:31:14.16
That's the whole world.

1208
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:17.16
And we had this awesome officer.

1209
01:31:17.16 --> 01:31:19.16
This is the time we had a mute, and all that.

1210
01:31:19.16 --> 01:31:23.16
And we got rid of our bad officer, we got this good officer came in and just made our lives awesome.

1211
01:31:23.16 --> 01:31:25.16
Our lives were awesome.

1212
01:31:25.16 --> 01:31:31.16
And so I said to myself, the back of my mind subconsciously kind of remotely conscious.

1213
01:31:31.16 --> 01:31:34.16
I don't know, but I realized that this guy made our lives awesome.

1214
01:31:34.16 --> 01:31:36.16
He made our world awesome.

1215
01:31:36.16 --> 01:31:43.16
And I said to myself, somewhere in the back, a little barely formed human brain of mine.

1216
01:31:43.16 --> 01:31:45.16
I said to myself, you know what?

1217
01:31:45.16 --> 01:31:50.16
Some day, this guy has made the our lives for us,

1218
01:31:50.16 --> 01:31:54.16
16 guys in this sial platoon, our lives are awesome now.

1219
01:31:54.16 --> 01:31:59.16
And some day, I'm going to try and make life good for 16 guys in a sial platoon.

1220
01:31:59.16 --> 01:32:01.16
That was my goal.

1221
01:32:01.16 --> 01:32:03.16
And for that world.

1222
01:32:03.16 --> 01:32:06.16
So when I say, hey, make the world a better place,

1223
01:32:06.16 --> 01:32:09.16
then what can you, who can you make the world a better place for?

1224
01:32:09.16 --> 01:32:12.16
Because you actually can't, you actually can't.

1225
01:32:12.16 --> 01:32:16.16
Well, yeah, whether it's some kid down the street,

1226
01:32:16.16 --> 01:32:19.16
whether it's somebody that needs help out there,

1227
01:32:19.16 --> 01:32:22.16
whether it's your own kid, how can you make the world a better place?

1228
01:32:22.16 --> 01:32:26.16
Because you can, what can you do to make it a little bit better?

1229
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:29.16
You know what it starts with making yourself a little bit better?

1230
01:32:29.16 --> 01:32:30.16
Get yourself stable.

1231
01:32:30.16 --> 01:32:31.16
I'll tell you that.

1232
01:32:31.16 --> 01:32:34.16
It's like the like the oxygen mask that drop down in the aircraft.

1233
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:36.16
You got to get yourself square to a first.

1234
01:32:36.16 --> 01:32:38.16
You want to get yourself square to a way?

1235
01:32:38.16 --> 01:32:41.16
I had somebody asked me the other day, like I'm bored.

1236
01:32:41.16 --> 01:32:43.16
What should I do?

1237
01:32:43.16 --> 01:32:45.16
And I was like, oh, if you're bored, that means you got room.

1238
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:46.16
You got capacity.

1239
01:32:46.16 --> 01:32:48.16
You can go help people.

1240
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:54.16
And you know how they say, like helping others is like the ultimate like reward.

1241
01:32:54.16 --> 01:32:56.16
You know, people they say that.

1242
01:32:56.16 --> 01:33:00.16
I think even before you square yourself away,

1243
01:33:00.16 --> 01:33:03.16
it's harder to make that connection, I think.

1244
01:33:03.16 --> 01:33:06.16
Yes, because you're still struggling yourself.

1245
01:33:06.16 --> 01:33:08.16
Yeah, it's kind of like a, when you plant the seed,

1246
01:33:08.16 --> 01:33:11.16
it's like the seed got to grow into a thing above ground first.

1247
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:14.16
And yeah, sort of sort of kind of way.

1248
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:18.16
But the more square it away, like you get,

1249
01:33:18.16 --> 01:33:22.16
not only the more capable you are of helping others more effectively,

1250
01:33:22.16 --> 01:33:24.16
but the more you can make that connection.

1251
01:33:24.16 --> 01:33:28.16
Like, oh, this reward is way better than when I achieve my sting.

1252
01:33:28.16 --> 01:33:29.16
Right?

1253
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:33.16
You know, that's why a lot of people like if they really love what they do.

1254
01:33:33.16 --> 01:33:35.16
I'm not saying everybody, but a lot of people with a love what they do,

1255
01:33:35.16 --> 01:33:39.16
but they're kind of like out of the game, they'll teach others how to do it.

1256
01:33:39.16 --> 01:33:41.16
It's just like a natural progression.

1257
01:33:41.16 --> 01:33:43.16
That is a natural possession that's true.

1258
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:47.16
Look at your jitz who, you become a world champion in your jitz who,

1259
01:33:47.16 --> 01:33:48.16
that's great.

1260
01:33:48.16 --> 01:33:53.16
But then eventually a lot of those guys become instructors and they have teams.

1261
01:33:53.16 --> 01:33:55.16
And that's what they want to do is spread the word.

1262
01:33:55.16 --> 01:33:56.16
Oh, yeah.

1263
01:33:56.16 --> 01:34:02.16
And like you see these guys who had like big big-tem careers and stuff.

1264
01:34:02.16 --> 01:34:06.16
I don't know, I love one they're teaching and you see all happy they are teaching others.

1265
01:34:06.16 --> 01:34:10.16
Like Bob Blue, and I'll see if the random example, but he popped in my head.

1266
01:34:10.16 --> 01:34:13.16
Because I've been to his class when he's teaching the kids.

1267
01:34:13.16 --> 01:34:14.16
That's everything, man.

1268
01:34:14.16 --> 01:34:16.16
I'm like, this guy's like really engaged with this.

1269
01:34:16.16 --> 01:34:18.16
You know, I'll say right now, my last.

1270
01:34:18.16 --> 01:34:22.16
And I knew I was, like my last few years in the Navy,

1271
01:34:22.16 --> 01:34:25.16
where I was running the training and I was really teaching all the time.

1272
01:34:25.16 --> 01:34:28.16
Like that was so good for me.

1273
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:31.16
I mean, it was so gratifying.

1274
01:34:31.16 --> 01:34:32.16
Yeah.

1275
01:34:32.16 --> 01:34:33.16
That's it.

1276
01:34:33.16 --> 01:34:34.16
Can I get to see the light?

1277
01:34:34.16 --> 01:34:35.16
I get to see people learn.

1278
01:34:35.16 --> 01:34:36.16
I get to see people.

1279
01:34:36.16 --> 01:34:38.16
I got to make the world good for someone.

1280
01:34:38.16 --> 01:34:39.16
Yeah.

1281
01:34:39.16 --> 01:34:43.16
You know, these these three guys that figure someone's a gamma and you're, you're a leader.

1282
01:34:43.16 --> 01:34:44.16
Yeah.

1283
01:34:44.16 --> 01:34:45.16
And that's, that's good stuff.

1284
01:34:45.16 --> 01:34:50.16
So yeah, when I talk about that sounds so, uh, tried.

1285
01:34:50.16 --> 01:34:52.16
You make the world a better place.

1286
01:34:52.16 --> 01:34:53.16
Yeah.

1287
01:34:53.16 --> 01:34:54.16
So how could I say that better?

1288
01:34:54.16 --> 01:34:55.16
Hey, man.

1289
01:34:55.16 --> 01:34:58.16
Fix something helps just fix something around you.

1290
01:34:58.16 --> 01:34:59.16
Yeah.

1291
01:34:59.16 --> 01:35:00.16
Make your world a better place.

1292
01:35:00.16 --> 01:35:01.16
And that's what I should say.

1293
01:35:01.16 --> 01:35:02.16
Make your world.

1294
01:35:02.16 --> 01:35:03.16
Or make someone else's world.

1295
01:35:03.16 --> 01:35:04.16
Just make it a little bit better.

1296
01:35:04.16 --> 01:35:05.16
Yeah.

1297
01:35:05.16 --> 01:35:08.16
You have that capability, believe it or not.

1298
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:13.16
And regardless of that, who that someone is, that someone, that someone is you too.

1299
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:15.16
By the way, actually you first.

1300
01:35:15.16 --> 01:35:17.16
Or could just be you.

1301
01:35:17.16 --> 01:35:18.16
Yeah.

1302
01:35:18.16 --> 01:35:20.16
Because if you make here, it's like if you have a neighborhood, right?

1303
01:35:20.16 --> 01:35:25.16
And the neighborhood, I don't know how they, you know how they, you know how they, you know how they got your long and you clean up your thing and you get that square in a way.

1304
01:35:25.16 --> 01:35:26.16
It's helping everyone.

1305
01:35:26.16 --> 01:35:29.16
Let's say there's 10 houses in a neighborhood, small neighborhood, whatever.

1306
01:35:29.16 --> 01:35:30.16
10 houses.

1307
01:35:30.16 --> 01:35:31.16
You cut your lawn.

1308
01:35:31.16 --> 01:35:32.16
You do your hedges.

1309
01:35:32.16 --> 01:35:33.16
You paint your house.

1310
01:35:33.16 --> 01:35:37.16
Make sure there's no trash in the yard or whatever.

1311
01:35:37.16 --> 01:35:40.16
You've improved that whole neighborhood by one tenth.

1312
01:35:40.16 --> 01:35:41.16
You're alone.

1313
01:35:41.16 --> 01:35:42.16
Let alone everybody else.

1314
01:35:42.16 --> 01:35:44.16
Don't even think about anybody else.

1315
01:35:44.16 --> 01:35:45.16
One tenth.

1316
01:35:45.16 --> 01:35:46.16
It's a lot.

1317
01:35:46.16 --> 01:35:47.16
Same.

1318
01:35:47.16 --> 01:35:48.16
So play that concept.

1319
01:35:48.16 --> 01:35:49.16
There you go.

1320
01:35:49.16 --> 01:35:50.16
That's what you do.

1321
01:35:50.16 --> 01:35:51.16
Boom.

1322
01:35:51.16 --> 01:35:52.16
There you go.

1323
01:35:52.16 --> 01:35:53.16
And like it.

1324
01:35:53.16 --> 01:35:54.16
So staying on the path.

1325
01:35:54.16 --> 01:35:56.16
That is help us help us.

1326
01:35:56.16 --> 01:35:57.16
That's what I said actually.

1327
01:35:57.16 --> 01:35:58.16
Help us.

1328
01:35:58.16 --> 01:36:01.16
Can you tell us how that can you help us help us?

1329
01:36:01.16 --> 01:36:02.16
Help us.

1330
01:36:02.16 --> 01:36:03.16
Yeah.

1331
01:36:03.16 --> 01:36:04.16
You see what I'm saying?

1332
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:05.16
Yes.

1333
01:36:05.16 --> 01:36:06.16
I do.

1334
01:36:06.16 --> 01:36:07.16
So yes.

1335
01:36:07.16 --> 01:36:08.16
Be happy to.

1336
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:11.16
So first thing obviously when we talk about you just do not obviously but we're going to talk about

1337
01:36:11.16 --> 01:36:12.16
you just.

1338
01:36:12.16 --> 01:36:13.16
I think it is actually obviously this point.

1339
01:36:13.16 --> 01:36:14.16
Yes.

1340
01:36:14.16 --> 01:36:15.16
It is.

1341
01:36:15.16 --> 01:36:19.16
You know many people tweet me a day or message me that they took their first

1342
01:36:19.16 --> 01:36:20.16
you just to class.

1343
01:36:20.16 --> 01:36:21.16
How many?

1344
01:36:21.16 --> 01:36:22.16
A lot.

1345
01:36:22.16 --> 01:36:25.16
I do know how for you people means like three sometimes.

1346
01:36:25.16 --> 01:36:26.16
Yeah.

1347
01:36:26.16 --> 01:36:28.16
We're like well people been asking for whatever.

1348
01:36:28.16 --> 01:36:29.16
Sure.

1349
01:36:29.16 --> 01:36:30.16
But sometimes that really means three people.

1350
01:36:30.16 --> 01:36:32.16
No I'm talking on a daily.

1351
01:36:32.16 --> 01:36:33.16
Daily.

1352
01:36:33.16 --> 01:36:34.16
Daily.

1353
01:36:34.16 --> 01:36:34.16
Daited basis.

1354
01:36:34.16 --> 01:36:35.16
Sure.

1355
01:36:35.16 --> 01:36:36.16
I would say.

1356
01:36:36.16 --> 01:36:37.16
I don't know.

1357
01:36:37.16 --> 01:36:38.16
I don't know.

1358
01:36:38.16 --> 01:36:40.16
Maybe three to five people a day.

1359
01:36:40.16 --> 01:36:41.16
A day daily.

1360
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:42.16
That's a lot.

1361
01:36:42.16 --> 01:36:43.16
Yeah.

1362
01:36:43.16 --> 01:36:45.16
Maybe it's over exaggerated in my head though.

1363
01:36:45.16 --> 01:36:46.16
You know what?

1364
01:36:46.16 --> 01:36:51.16
I don't think so because every single time I go on to dinner which is pretty much every day.

1365
01:36:51.16 --> 01:36:52.16
Pretty much.

1366
01:36:52.16 --> 01:36:54.16
There's at least one person in.

1367
01:36:54.16 --> 01:36:56.16
You know the alerts right?

1368
01:36:56.16 --> 01:36:57.16
Yeah.

1369
01:36:57.16 --> 01:36:58.16
Yeah.

1370
01:36:58.16 --> 01:37:00.16
That I'm like copied in or whatever.

1371
01:37:00.16 --> 01:37:01.16
Yeah.

1372
01:37:01.16 --> 01:37:04.16
It'll say got me first to just class or got beat up.

1373
01:37:04.16 --> 01:37:05.16
Yeah.

1374
01:37:05.16 --> 01:37:07.16
So and then this is every single time.

1375
01:37:07.16 --> 01:37:08.16
Yeah.

1376
01:37:08.16 --> 01:37:09.16
I literally cannot remember.

1377
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:10.16
See so it's a lot.

1378
01:37:10.16 --> 01:37:12.16
People are getting on the GJ2 train.

1379
01:37:12.16 --> 01:37:13.16
Yeah.

1380
01:37:13.16 --> 01:37:14.16
For sure.

1381
01:37:14.16 --> 01:37:15.16
Yes.

1382
01:37:15.16 --> 01:37:18.16
So it's kind of obvious that we're going to talk about GJ2 a little bit.

1383
01:37:18.16 --> 01:37:19.16
You know what else is good?

1384
01:37:19.16 --> 01:37:22.16
Very few people say.

1385
01:37:22.16 --> 01:37:24.16
I tried GJ2.

1386
01:37:24.16 --> 01:37:26.16
I just don't like it.

1387
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:27.16
That's very.

1388
01:37:27.16 --> 01:37:32.16
I've actually I can only think of off the top of my head one individual out of all those people.

1389
01:37:32.16 --> 01:37:36.16
That like went back and forth with me and it was just like look I do not like this.

1390
01:37:36.16 --> 01:37:40.16
I think this is the guy that I said look you need to train until you submit someone.

1391
01:37:40.16 --> 01:37:41.16
Yeah.

1392
01:37:41.16 --> 01:37:42.16
Then you can stop.

1393
01:37:42.16 --> 01:37:45.16
If you can submit someone you're like okay I don't like this.

1394
01:37:45.16 --> 01:37:46.16
Yeah.

1395
01:37:46.16 --> 01:37:47.16
This is pretty hard to understand.

1396
01:37:47.16 --> 01:37:48.16
And it's truly not.

1397
01:37:48.16 --> 01:37:49.16
It's really not for you.

1398
01:37:49.16 --> 01:37:50.16
Yeah.

1399
01:37:50.16 --> 01:37:52.16
You tap someone out.

1400
01:37:52.16 --> 01:37:53.16
Then.

1401
01:37:53.16 --> 01:37:54.16
Yeah.

1402
01:37:54.16 --> 01:37:55.16
Yeah.

1403
01:37:55.16 --> 01:37:56.16
I did it's not for you.

1404
01:37:56.16 --> 01:37:59.16
But I bet you even that person once they got that.

1405
01:37:59.16 --> 01:38:00.16
Mark.

1406
01:38:00.16 --> 01:38:00.16
Yeah.

1407
01:38:00.16 --> 01:38:02.16
It's just like this.

1408
01:38:02.16 --> 01:38:03.16
It's.

1409
01:38:03.16 --> 01:38:04.16
It's for me.

1410
01:38:04.16 --> 01:38:05.16
Yeah.

1411
01:38:05.16 --> 01:38:06.16
I would that.

1412
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:07.16
My money would be on that scenario.

1413
01:38:07.16 --> 01:38:10.16
So you felt a little bit of claustrophobia, right?

1414
01:38:10.16 --> 01:38:11.16
In my life I know you're over it.

1415
01:38:11.16 --> 01:38:13.16
But it could could could could.

1416
01:38:13.16 --> 01:38:16.16
Could that alone stop someone from wanting to train to to because I had one guy and a

1417
01:38:16.16 --> 01:38:19.16
seal put it with me that he would get.

1418
01:38:19.16 --> 01:38:22.52
that he would get so, a coupside train with everyone,

1419
01:38:22.52 --> 01:38:23.72
and when I would train with him,

1420
01:38:23.72 --> 01:38:25.92
he would get so freaked out.

1421
01:38:25.92 --> 01:38:27.12
Like he would start like,

1422
01:38:27.12 --> 01:38:29.72
like getting actually mad at me.

1423
01:38:29.72 --> 01:38:30.44
You know,

1424
01:38:30.44 --> 01:38:33.08
you know, that.

1425
01:38:33.08 --> 01:38:34.40
And of course, what did I do?

1426
01:38:34.40 --> 01:38:35.24
Ah,

1427
01:38:35.24 --> 01:38:36.24
ah,

1428
01:38:36.24 --> 01:38:37.24
pull the jacco.

1429
01:38:37.24 --> 01:38:39.28
Yeah, I would decide controlled.

1430
01:38:39.28 --> 01:38:40.80
This smash,

1431
01:38:40.80 --> 01:38:42.24
closes I could.

1432
01:38:42.24 --> 01:38:43.08
Yeah.

1433
01:38:43.08 --> 01:38:45.36
Squeeze, just smash.

1434
01:38:45.36 --> 01:38:46.80
Try and, you know what though?

1435
01:38:46.80 --> 01:38:47.60
Try to help us,

1436
01:38:47.60 --> 01:38:48.96
try to make us world a better place.

1437
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:50.08
You're getting over that.

1438
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:50.88
Exposure.

1439
01:38:50.88 --> 01:38:51.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exposure.

1440
01:38:51.92 --> 01:38:52.92
Situation.

1441
01:38:52.92 --> 01:38:53.72
Yes, though.

1442
01:38:53.72 --> 01:38:54.40
The answer is yes.

1443
01:38:54.40 --> 01:38:57.20
I think that because claustrophobia is like,

1444
01:38:57.20 --> 01:38:58.56
like, for real claustrophobia,

1445
01:38:58.56 --> 01:38:59.24
not just like,

1446
01:38:59.24 --> 01:39:00.60
why am I uncomfortable with that?

1447
01:39:00.60 --> 01:39:02.48
But like, if you have a fur ill claustrophobia

1448
01:39:02.48 --> 01:39:03.40
and it's a spectrum,

1449
01:39:03.40 --> 01:39:05.56
it's getting some people by the worse than others.

1450
01:39:05.56 --> 01:39:06.72
But yeah, if they have,

1451
01:39:06.72 --> 01:39:09.96
somebody on the hard core claustrophobia spectrum.

1452
01:39:09.96 --> 01:39:13.04
And then they got introduced to it early on.

1453
01:39:13.04 --> 01:39:16.28
And someone that was like a smasher, right?

1454
01:39:16.28 --> 01:39:17.12
Yeah.

1455
01:39:17.12 --> 01:39:18.68
Because you wouldn't feel claustrophobia.

1456
01:39:18.68 --> 01:39:22.52
If you were going with someone that's got like an open butterfly,

1457
01:39:22.52 --> 01:39:23.48
slash,

1458
01:39:23.48 --> 01:39:24.52
lasto guard.

1459
01:39:24.52 --> 01:39:25.68
Yeah, like, well, yes.

1460
01:39:25.68 --> 01:39:26.80
You're not feeling very claustrophobia.

1461
01:39:26.80 --> 01:39:28.56
You might think, so it's called that triangle.

1462
01:39:28.56 --> 01:39:29.92
Then something you freaking out with that.

1463
01:39:29.92 --> 01:39:31.76
Yeah, that building tap and you're out.

1464
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:33.16
The place where you really feel claustrophobia

1465
01:39:33.16 --> 01:39:34.80
is cross side or mountain.

1466
01:39:34.80 --> 01:39:35.64
Or yeah.

1467
01:39:35.64 --> 01:39:38.60
So, and it's not even necessarily a smasher, per se.

1468
01:39:38.60 --> 01:39:42.08
Because you can be mounted just normal mount,

1469
01:39:42.08 --> 01:39:44.80
not smashing pressure, whatever just normal mount.

1470
01:39:44.80 --> 01:39:46.12
Because it's not like it's,

1471
01:39:46.12 --> 01:39:47.40
because claustrophobia is psychological.

1472
01:39:47.40 --> 01:39:49.88
But it's not like a physical thing, primer.

1473
01:39:49.88 --> 01:39:52.64
I mean, there's physical elements for sure.

1474
01:39:52.64 --> 01:39:56.64
It has to be, but if you just feel like you can't get out

1475
01:39:56.64 --> 01:39:58.48
or you can't breathe or, you know,

1476
01:39:58.48 --> 01:40:00.24
it's like, that's the feeling.

1477
01:40:00.24 --> 01:40:03.60
But so like a lot of times, even when I was working through mine,

1478
01:40:03.60 --> 01:40:05.36
and you'd be like smashing me all hard,

1479
01:40:05.36 --> 01:40:06.72
I'd be like, right, you're wasting your energy.

1480
01:40:06.72 --> 01:40:08.48
The smashing doesn't do it.

1481
01:40:08.48 --> 01:40:10.04
When we're rolling in, it's quiet,

1482
01:40:10.04 --> 01:40:11.88
especially when you're like, oh, when I know you're doing it

1483
01:40:11.88 --> 01:40:13.16
on purpose, it helps.

1484
01:40:13.16 --> 01:40:15.76
It helps me because it seems like a game.

1485
01:40:15.76 --> 01:40:17.32
Like you're just messing with me now.

1486
01:40:17.32 --> 01:40:19.000
So it's like, but if it's serious,

1487
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.24
if we're just rolling, we're not saying anything.

1488
01:40:21.24 --> 01:40:24.64
And it's like, now I'm faced with either staying in this position

1489
01:40:24.64 --> 01:40:26.44
right now forever, because I can't get out.

1490
01:40:26.44 --> 01:40:28.000
I can't get out of your side, control right now.

1491
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.92
Like history has proven to be kind of thing in my brain.

1492
01:40:31.92 --> 01:40:35.72
You still either, I suck it up indefinitely,

1493
01:40:35.72 --> 01:40:38.84
or I tap out, both of those to me are death,

1494
01:40:38.84 --> 01:40:41.68
like to tap out because you're tired or claustrophobia.

1495
01:40:41.68 --> 01:40:44.44
Like that's worse than tapping out from a submission.

1496
01:40:44.44 --> 01:40:47.24
So that's why a lot of times you would claustrophobia

1497
01:40:47.24 --> 01:40:50.68
to me into giving me, giving you my arm or something like that.

1498
01:40:50.68 --> 01:40:51.68
And then I'd have to tap out.

1499
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:52.80
But that's how it went, then.

1500
01:40:52.80 --> 01:40:55.36
So it was just, I think you tap two times

1501
01:40:55.36 --> 01:40:57.08
from just straight claustrophobia,

1502
01:40:57.08 --> 01:40:59.12
because you didn't freaking take this submission

1503
01:40:59.12 --> 01:40:59.96
on this giving you.

1504
01:40:59.96 --> 01:41:01.20
And that's like terrible.

1505
01:41:01.20 --> 01:41:03.68
And I remember, I was about to be let down

1506
01:41:03.68 --> 01:41:05.32
at myself as you were saying all this.

1507
01:41:05.32 --> 01:41:08.76
I was kind of disappointed myself that I didn't identify that,

1508
01:41:08.76 --> 01:41:11.96
that there was a further torture I could have been doing to you,

1509
01:41:11.96 --> 01:41:14.08
but it looks like sometimes I did figure it out.

1510
01:41:14.08 --> 01:41:14.92
Yeah.

1511
01:41:14.92 --> 01:41:19.20
You did. So I remember here, I remember one time,

1512
01:41:19.20 --> 01:41:20.48
not to go too deep into this,

1513
01:41:20.48 --> 01:41:22.96
because I want to tell you a lot about origin.

1514
01:41:22.96 --> 01:41:27.28
So there's this one time where I forget if I rolled with you

1515
01:41:27.28 --> 01:41:29.56
like that day or the day it was really recently

1516
01:41:29.56 --> 01:41:30.40
I rolled with you.

1517
01:41:30.40 --> 01:41:33.32
And I was feeling claustrophobia and, you know,

1518
01:41:33.32 --> 01:41:35.84
I gave you my arm and then you took him out.

1519
01:41:35.84 --> 01:41:38.60
I was like, yes, like I was happy that he tapped me out

1520
01:41:38.60 --> 01:41:39.92
and let me out of there,

1521
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:42.48
because it's like it's really bad when you feel that.

1522
01:41:42.48 --> 01:41:46.20
So the next day I see you rolling with Dean and Dean gets you

1523
01:41:46.20 --> 01:41:47.48
in double snowing.

1524
01:41:47.48 --> 01:41:50.56
And you guys were rolling hard for a long time

1525
01:41:50.56 --> 01:41:52.16
and I'm like, Tang these guys are going hard.

1526
01:41:52.16 --> 01:41:54.60
I would be and I'm kind of empathizing me

1527
01:41:54.60 --> 01:41:57.12
and when you put yourself in the other person's situation.

1528
01:41:57.12 --> 01:41:58.84
So I'm like, hey, thinking to myself,

1529
01:41:58.84 --> 01:42:00.68
man, these guys are going hard for a long time.

1530
01:42:00.68 --> 01:42:02.24
I would be gasping right now.

1531
01:42:02.24 --> 01:42:05.04
And then Dean was like, he was kind of getting the better.

1532
01:42:05.04 --> 01:42:05.88
You got out.

1533
01:42:05.88 --> 01:42:07.72
I was like, I'm feeling for Jocca right now,

1534
01:42:07.72 --> 01:42:10.84
because I've been in that scenario where it's like we're going hard

1535
01:42:10.84 --> 01:42:12.96
and then I wind up in Mount, I'd be like, man,

1536
01:42:12.96 --> 01:42:17.32
I'm feeling like, like, breath in my, just by watching.

1537
01:42:17.32 --> 01:42:18.80
And then he gets you in double snowing.

1538
01:42:18.80 --> 01:42:22.04
I'm like, I was getting like microwave anxiety.

1539
01:42:22.04 --> 01:42:24.84
From the double snowing until that Dean is doing on you.

1540
01:42:24.84 --> 01:42:26.40
Because that's claustrophobia right there.

1541
01:42:26.40 --> 01:42:27.24
I like this.

1542
01:42:27.24 --> 01:42:28.52
And I like you can't do it.

1543
01:42:28.52 --> 01:42:29.36
You can't move.

1544
01:42:29.36 --> 01:42:30.24
It was my reaction.

1545
01:42:30.24 --> 01:42:32.40
It's probably just powered through it, right?

1546
01:42:32.40 --> 01:42:34.68
Like you didn't even, I don't think he even tapped you.

1547
01:42:34.68 --> 01:42:36.84
But he was like that for a long time.

1548
01:42:36.84 --> 01:42:39.20
And I was like, I was like, this guy's a different,

1549
01:42:39.20 --> 01:42:41.40
another level of savid.

1550
01:42:41.40 --> 01:42:43.60
And I'm not saying necessarily with the grappling.

1551
01:42:43.60 --> 01:42:44.72
I mean, that was sort of like a,

1552
01:42:44.72 --> 01:42:45.76
you know, that was the side thing.

1553
01:42:45.76 --> 01:42:48.04
Just the fact that you can endure what I just witnessed

1554
01:42:48.04 --> 01:42:50.48
you endure compared to my own shit.

1555
01:42:50.48 --> 01:42:52.68
That was a man.

1556
01:42:52.68 --> 01:42:55.84
Nonetheless, man, so then when I'm in the next day,

1557
01:42:55.84 --> 01:42:58.000
what do you mean, was there a follow on where I rolled

1558
01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.32
with your getters at the story?

1559
01:42:59.32 --> 01:43:00.32
No, no, no, no.

1560
01:43:00.32 --> 01:43:03.44
What I was comparing it to what was helping me really get into your

1561
01:43:03.44 --> 01:43:05.92
shoes is because I was remembering, it could have been that same day

1562
01:43:05.92 --> 01:43:07.20
that we rolled.

1563
01:43:07.20 --> 01:43:09.68
And I just gave into the classroom for me.

1564
01:43:09.68 --> 01:43:10.88
Like you was like, I had an issue.

1565
01:43:10.88 --> 01:43:15.88
I was like in terrible shape, I would go train like twice a week,

1566
01:43:15.88 --> 01:43:19.92
maybe, you know, and not, it is just a bad scenario.

1567
01:43:19.92 --> 01:43:22.20
But nonetheless, yes, the answer is yes.

1568
01:43:22.20 --> 01:43:26.96
If someone gets into duty to and they have a claustrophobic

1569
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:28.08
pre-existing condition.

1570
01:43:28.08 --> 01:43:31.28
Yeah, and then they get into the claustrophobia situation

1571
01:43:31.28 --> 01:43:34.96
early on, like the first or second day or something.

1572
01:43:34.96 --> 01:43:37.16
Yeah, I could see how they wouldn't want to go back.

1573
01:43:37.16 --> 01:43:38.16
I don't know.

1574
01:43:38.16 --> 01:43:39.92
But here's a good thing about that.

1575
01:43:39.92 --> 01:43:43.32
If you do duty to and reap the payoffs of duty to,

1576
01:43:43.32 --> 01:43:46.76
and then you get into claustrophobic situation,

1577
01:43:46.76 --> 01:43:50.40
you're more worried about, like, how can I overcome the claustrophobia?

1578
01:43:50.40 --> 01:43:54.20
More so than, hey, duty to produces too much claustrophobia for me.

1579
01:43:54.20 --> 01:43:57.84
Yeah, because you know the benefits and you feel like the payoff

1580
01:43:57.84 --> 01:44:02.44
of the duty to weigh more than you care about or fear claustrophobia.

1581
01:44:02.44 --> 01:44:04.16
That's my analysis anyway.

1582
01:44:04.16 --> 01:44:05.36
So speaking of duty to.

1583
01:44:05.36 --> 01:44:06.92
Yeah, you're going to need a geek.

1584
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:07.92
So you get an origin geek.

1585
01:44:07.92 --> 01:44:08.92
That's it straight up.

1586
01:44:08.92 --> 01:44:09.92
There it is.

1587
01:44:09.92 --> 01:44:10.92
Answered you question.

1588
01:44:10.92 --> 01:44:15.16
Because planning people, planning people, still ask me what

1589
01:44:15.16 --> 01:44:16.16
get you get.

1590
01:44:16.16 --> 01:44:17.16
Yeah.

1591
01:44:17.16 --> 01:44:19.44
Or you know why it's because people start at podcast one.

1592
01:44:19.44 --> 01:44:20.44
Yeah.

1593
01:44:20.44 --> 01:44:21.44
And I do.

1594
01:44:21.44 --> 01:44:24.48
And so they're, well, they get them by podcast.

1595
01:44:24.48 --> 01:44:27.16
You know, I was asking people at the camp.

1596
01:44:27.16 --> 01:44:30.04
I was asking people what broke you.

1597
01:44:30.04 --> 01:44:33.44
Like, because people get meaning they're listening to the podcast.

1598
01:44:33.44 --> 01:44:35.08
And they're like, well, they're talking about the future.

1599
01:44:35.08 --> 01:44:36.08
Now, well, they're talking about.

1600
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:40.60
But then they'll be like, you, you, when you were talking on podcast, 23, you

1601
01:44:40.60 --> 01:44:42.24
are like, there's nothing else I can.

1602
01:44:42.24 --> 01:44:43.48
I was like, okay, I'm trying to say.

1603
01:44:43.48 --> 01:44:46.12
So there's certain podcasts that people got out of school.

1604
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:47.08
And I'm just going to do this.

1605
01:44:47.08 --> 01:44:48.08
Yeah.

1606
01:44:48.08 --> 01:44:52.44
And I think you posted something on social media the other day.

1607
01:44:52.44 --> 01:44:59.08
That said that you, if you're a white belt, you already have achieved more than 99

1608
01:44:59.08 --> 01:45:00.44
percent of people in the world.

1609
01:45:00.44 --> 01:45:01.44
Yeah.

1610
01:45:01.44 --> 01:45:04.12
Because how many people, less than 1% of the people in the world, due to

1611
01:45:04.12 --> 01:45:05.12
get you for sure.

1612
01:45:05.12 --> 01:45:06.12
Yeah.

1613
01:45:06.12 --> 01:45:07.12
For sure.

1614
01:45:07.12 --> 01:45:08.12
Yeah, fully.

1615
01:45:08.12 --> 01:45:09.12
And yeah, I reposted.

1616
01:45:09.12 --> 01:45:12.12
I retweeted it from Joey Sylvester.

1617
01:45:12.12 --> 01:45:14.80
And I think he even retweeted it from somebody.

1618
01:45:14.80 --> 01:45:15.80
Because so true.

1619
01:45:15.80 --> 01:45:21.36
And the reason I reposted it is, of course, for new people coming in.

1620
01:45:21.36 --> 01:45:22.36
But that's a good reminder.

1621
01:45:22.36 --> 01:45:23.64
It was a good reminder for me.

1622
01:45:23.64 --> 01:45:27.48
For every, because I think it's a good reminder for everybody because, you know, that

1623
01:45:27.48 --> 01:45:31.24
feeling like, you know, when people are, man, I, I, I, for everybody in everything, not

1624
01:45:31.24 --> 01:45:32.24
just due to it.

1625
01:45:32.24 --> 01:45:36.16
Because there's other stuff that you should be doing that you might not be doing.

1626
01:45:36.16 --> 01:45:37.16
Yeah.

1627
01:45:37.16 --> 01:45:39.40
Because you're like, oh, well, I don't want to cross the line or I don't want to take

1628
01:45:39.40 --> 01:45:40.40
the first step.

1629
01:45:40.40 --> 01:45:41.40
Yeah.

1630
01:45:41.40 --> 01:45:42.40
You know, I don't want to take the first step.

1631
01:45:42.40 --> 01:45:43.76
Take the first step is always big.

1632
01:45:43.76 --> 01:45:44.76
Yeah.

1633
01:45:44.76 --> 01:45:49.56
But even like taking, so yeah, again, there's two elements to that.

1634
01:45:49.56 --> 01:45:52.36
Taking the first step, meaning if you're not in digits and you take the first step to go

1635
01:45:52.36 --> 01:45:53.76
two digits, right?

1636
01:45:53.76 --> 01:45:54.76
There's that.

1637
01:45:54.76 --> 01:46:00.20
And then to me, it was like, when you get your ass kicked, you know, like, even even

1638
01:46:00.20 --> 01:46:03.44
you, how you say, like, sometimes I'll just get my ass kicked some day or

1639
01:46:03.44 --> 01:46:04.44
sure.

1640
01:46:04.44 --> 01:46:06.84
Like, and people will no matter what level they are, they'll be like, oh, man, you

1641
01:46:06.84 --> 01:46:09.24
know, they'll say, oh, man, I got my ass kicked, but I'm ready, you know, and

1642
01:46:09.24 --> 01:46:11.12
I'm coming back and I liked it and all this stuff.

1643
01:46:11.12 --> 01:46:15.84
And then they'll ask when, when do I not feel so awkward?

1644
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:18.20
And when do I not feel like I don't know what I'm doing?

1645
01:46:18.20 --> 01:46:21.32
I'm like, well, you, it all, you always feel like that.

1646
01:46:21.32 --> 01:46:25.20
You just feel like that little bit less every, every year, whatever.

1647
01:46:25.20 --> 01:46:29.60
And so, and sometimes you can be at a high level and feel like that more often than

1648
01:46:29.60 --> 01:46:33.40
not still, you know, because it just did depends on training partners, all that stuff.

1649
01:46:33.40 --> 01:46:36.64
So that I thought that that was a really good reminder is like being there.

1650
01:46:36.64 --> 01:46:37.76
It's like super important.

1651
01:46:37.76 --> 01:46:38.76
Yeah.

1652
01:46:38.76 --> 01:46:39.96
And it's like really beneficial.

1653
01:46:39.96 --> 01:46:40.96
It is.

1654
01:46:40.96 --> 01:46:44.88
And also, to take the first step, if you're out there, let this be the podcast.

1655
01:46:44.88 --> 01:46:48.64
Number 143 that you said, you know what, man, I've heard enough talk about this.

1656
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:49.64
I'm going to go get some.

1657
01:46:49.64 --> 01:46:50.64
Yeah.

1658
01:46:50.64 --> 01:46:51.64
Today is the day.

1659
01:46:51.64 --> 01:46:53.68
It's plenty of digits, you schools out there.

1660
01:46:53.68 --> 01:46:54.68
Yeah.

1661
01:46:54.68 --> 01:46:55.88
And most of them are good.

1662
01:46:55.88 --> 01:46:58.92
You know, which one makes or not, which one, but when?

1663
01:46:58.92 --> 01:47:02.60
This is what makes me like one, I just go train right now.

1664
01:47:02.60 --> 01:47:06.48
Is anytime you go into one of your spills about how it's a superpower.

1665
01:47:06.48 --> 01:47:07.48
It's absolutely true.

1666
01:47:07.48 --> 01:47:09.48
That's what I was telling Cole.

1667
01:47:09.48 --> 01:47:13.000
I like when we were waiting earlier today, my cousin called.

1668
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
He, um, how?

1669
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.56
When you start a jiu-jitsu, like you could do jiu-jitsu for one year and right then at that point,

1670
01:47:20.56 --> 01:47:24.000
you can beat up everyone else who doesn't do jiu-jitsu.

1671
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.24
Like in a just an in a general way, in a jiu-jitsu.

1672
01:47:26.24 --> 01:47:27.24
You know, like that.

1673
01:47:27.24 --> 01:47:28.24
You're roughly speaking.

1674
01:47:28.24 --> 01:47:29.24
Yeah, roughly speaking.

1675
01:47:29.24 --> 01:47:31.24
You can narrow their exceptions for sure.

1676
01:47:31.24 --> 01:47:35.24
But, you know, like there's not many things in the world that are like that or like that.

1677
01:47:35.24 --> 01:47:36.24
Yeah.

1678
01:47:36.24 --> 01:47:37.24
Yeah.

1679
01:47:37.24 --> 01:47:38.24
No, it's a superpower.

1680
01:47:38.24 --> 01:47:39.24
Yeah.

1681
01:47:39.24 --> 01:47:43.24
So every time I listen to you say, that kind of thing and do your little explanation,

1682
01:47:43.24 --> 01:47:44.84
that's like, yeah, man, that's true.

1683
01:47:44.84 --> 01:47:46.24
Because it kind of reputes it into it.

1684
01:47:46.24 --> 01:47:50.24
Yeah, when people bring their kids in here, I tell them, I was telling this family, that's

1685
01:47:50.24 --> 01:47:51.24
the other day.

1686
01:47:51.24 --> 01:47:57.72
I said, I said, I truly believe that jiu-jitsu is the best thing you can give your kid.

1687
01:47:57.72 --> 01:47:58.72
Including love.

1688
01:47:58.72 --> 01:48:03.72
I can let the jiu-jitsu.

1689
01:48:03.72 --> 01:48:07.32
So yeah, I think it's very important.

1690
01:48:07.32 --> 01:48:09.48
So you can get your keys for more jiu-jitsu.

1691
01:48:09.48 --> 01:48:10.84
Or give me a dot com.

1692
01:48:10.84 --> 01:48:12.32
Made in Maine.

1693
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:15.64
That's why it's ordered in Maine.com.

1694
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:17.64
And they're made there.

1695
01:48:17.64 --> 01:48:20.56
And they're made specifically for jiu-jitsu.

1696
01:48:20.56 --> 01:48:22.88
The weave is for jiu-jitsu.

1697
01:48:22.88 --> 01:48:25.000
The fabric is for jiu-jitsu.

1698
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.68
The cut is for jiu-jitsu.

1699
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:37.20
Made by people that do jiu-jitsu, black belts in jiu-jitsu, designed by people that train.

1700
01:48:37.20 --> 01:48:45.96
People that are black belts, dedeko, Peter Roberts in there with scissors cutting these.

1701
01:48:45.96 --> 01:48:47.96
Yeah, sure scissors.

1702
01:48:47.96 --> 01:48:48.96
Well, that was lasers.

1703
01:48:48.96 --> 01:48:52.72
Yeah, I haven't really seen any scissors, but I've seen those little witty comb, little

1704
01:48:52.72 --> 01:48:53.72
soft thing.

1705
01:48:53.72 --> 01:48:54.72
Yeah.

1706
01:48:54.72 --> 01:48:56.68
No, but when you make the original pattern, do you got to use scissors?

1707
01:48:56.68 --> 01:48:57.68
No.

1708
01:48:57.68 --> 01:48:58.68
I don't know.

1709
01:48:58.68 --> 01:48:59.68
That can't stop.

1710
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:00.68
Yeah, I know now though.

1711
01:49:00.68 --> 01:49:01.68
I know that's good.

1712
01:49:01.68 --> 01:49:03.48
So yeah, scissors saw all that stuff.

1713
01:49:03.48 --> 01:49:04.48
All made in America.

1714
01:49:04.48 --> 01:49:07.48
If you train in nogie, you get the rash guards.

1715
01:49:07.48 --> 01:49:09.76
A rash guards, 100%.

1716
01:49:09.76 --> 01:49:14.20
And they're also made here in America, which is a big deal.

1717
01:49:14.20 --> 01:49:19.36
And if you're doing other exercise outside of jiu-jitsu, you've got joggers if you're

1718
01:49:19.36 --> 01:49:23.68
jogging, or if you're just cruising, whatever, and hoodies, and sure it's what not.

1719
01:49:23.68 --> 01:49:24.68
A peril.

1720
01:49:24.68 --> 01:49:25.68
Parallel.

1721
01:49:25.68 --> 01:49:26.52
Orgene Maine.com.

1722
01:49:26.52 --> 01:49:28.04
All made in America, by the way.

1723
01:49:28.04 --> 01:49:29.04
Also supplements.

1724
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:31.04
Jockel supplements.

1725
01:49:31.04 --> 01:49:32.04
Yeah.

1726
01:49:32.04 --> 01:49:35.32
Now people have been asking me, joint warfare or...

1727
01:49:35.32 --> 01:49:36.32
Grilloio.

1728
01:49:36.32 --> 01:49:38.32
Good question, by the way.

1729
01:49:38.32 --> 01:49:40.60
It's a good question.

1730
01:49:40.60 --> 01:49:45.64
I think Brian, I asked him the same question, because I have a hard time answering it.

1731
01:49:45.64 --> 01:49:48.56
The reason I have a hard time answering is because I do both all the time, and I'm not

1732
01:49:48.56 --> 01:49:50.28
stopping anyone from as an experiment.

1733
01:49:50.28 --> 01:49:51.28
I'm not doing that.

1734
01:49:51.28 --> 01:49:52.28
It's not worth it.

1735
01:49:52.28 --> 01:49:53.28
It's not worth it.

1736
01:49:53.28 --> 01:49:54.28
It's not worth it.

1737
01:49:54.28 --> 01:49:55.28
It's not worth it.

1738
01:49:55.28 --> 01:49:58.80
He said, and I kind of agree with this, it makes sense.

1739
01:49:58.80 --> 01:50:08.12
If you are doing preventative, Criolloio, if you're doing heal, joint warfare, good way

1740
01:50:08.12 --> 01:50:09.12
to put it.

1741
01:50:09.12 --> 01:50:11.84
My recommendation kind of is like a du-bulf.

1742
01:50:11.84 --> 01:50:12.84
Yeah.

1743
01:50:12.84 --> 01:50:13.84
Take them both.

1744
01:50:13.84 --> 01:50:15.52
But that sounds like a good idea.

1745
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:21.04
So if you have, if you're joints, like just started bothering you, or you got the elbows

1746
01:50:21.04 --> 01:50:24.92
bothering you, your shoulders bothering you, I think shoulders for me is the one that I always

1747
01:50:24.92 --> 01:50:25.92
notice.

1748
01:50:25.92 --> 01:50:26.92
Yeah.

1749
01:50:26.92 --> 01:50:29.40
Then if it's hurt, get on.

1750
01:50:29.40 --> 01:50:30.40
Get on some joint warfare.

1751
01:50:30.40 --> 01:50:31.40
Yeah.

1752
01:50:31.40 --> 01:50:32.40
Yeah.

1753
01:50:32.40 --> 01:50:33.40
That's good.

1754
01:50:33.40 --> 01:50:38.48
And I say both because the way I would see it and put it, and this is just kind of the way

1755
01:50:38.48 --> 01:50:40.12
I say it, where it's like an 80-20.

1756
01:50:40.12 --> 01:50:44.24
You know, it's not like, oh, joint warfare is 100% for healing up and recovering.

1757
01:50:44.24 --> 01:50:46.88
You know, I actually don't think that at all.

1758
01:50:46.88 --> 01:50:51.08
But yeah, I just, and the other thing, how well, I don't know.

1759
01:50:51.08 --> 01:50:52.08
Yeah.

1760
01:50:52.08 --> 01:50:55.36
And he said, I'm putting it out there, I'm not, I would, yeah.

1761
01:50:55.36 --> 01:50:56.36
I would, yeah.

1762
01:50:56.36 --> 01:50:57.54
I obviously recommend both.

1763
01:50:57.54 --> 01:51:00.24
But you know, if somebody has to beat that cost a lot of money, and some people

1764
01:51:00.24 --> 01:51:01.76
like, you know what, I can only afford one.

1765
01:51:01.76 --> 01:51:02.76
Cool.

1766
01:51:02.76 --> 01:51:03.76
Take, take, take, take.

1767
01:51:03.76 --> 01:51:09.04
Kiloil, because that's all encompassing health, right?

1768
01:51:09.04 --> 01:51:13.18
Whereas joints, yeah, when your joints start getting jacked up a little bit.

1769
01:51:13.18 --> 01:51:15.70
Which, by the way, if you're doing Gigi-two, you're going to feel it.

1770
01:51:15.70 --> 01:51:16.88
You're going to feel Gigi-two.

1771
01:51:16.88 --> 01:51:20.68
Fuf, Gigi-two is not a sport that you don't feel.

1772
01:51:20.68 --> 01:51:21.68
Yeah.

1773
01:51:21.68 --> 01:51:27.36
feel you feel it. Yes, true, but they're both good 100%. And then you got

1774
01:51:27.36 --> 01:51:34.08
a mulk. So I'm I'm I'm envisioning a world one day because I was in the

1775
01:51:34.08 --> 01:51:39.20
traveling yesterday horrible and man I got like a chocolate milk like a regular

1776
01:51:39.20 --> 01:51:43.52
chocolate milk which is just awful crap. And it doesn't even taste as good.

1777
01:51:43.52 --> 01:51:47.44
No, doesn't taste. You got used to the mulk. That's what it was. But still

1778
01:51:47.44 --> 01:51:56.80
objectively, it does not taste as good. And it's unhealthy. So one day, one day, in this

1779
01:51:56.80 --> 01:52:03.08
world, you'll be able to go to the little shop in the airport, the the 7

1780
01:52:03.08 --> 01:52:06.24
11 and you'll just be able to walk and they'll have a little counter for mulk.

1781
01:52:06.24 --> 01:52:10.88
They'll have a little mulk situation. They will. Because how can they not do that?

1782
01:52:10.88 --> 01:52:14.40
I'm convention. Right? No, I mean, eventually you fast forward. I don't know if

1783
01:52:14.40 --> 01:52:17.84
it's going to take two years or four years, but eventually so many people are going to

1784
01:52:17.84 --> 01:52:24.24
demand it. It's going to be more restaurants. There's going to be different flavors.

1785
01:52:24.24 --> 01:52:28.48
You're just going to go under like little mulk bars. They won't even have food.

1786
01:52:28.48 --> 01:52:31.04
They'll just have mulk. Mulk, yeah, you know how they have to kill the bars.

1787
01:52:31.04 --> 01:52:36.32
Yeah, yeah, yeah, same thing. But mulk, but different mulk on top. Yeah, that sounds like a

1788
01:52:36.32 --> 01:52:41.28
good idea. You know, I have that dream too, you know, and until then, yeah, you

1789
01:52:41.28 --> 01:52:46.16
can get it or do you need to come? Also discipline too. If you want to get your mind right,

1790
01:52:46.16 --> 01:52:49.92
you know, that expression. Get your mind right. Yeah. Not to say your mind is not right. I'm saying

1791
01:52:49.92 --> 01:52:53.92
you don't even even even the most fired up I've ever heard a guy tell me about getting his mind right.

1792
01:52:53.92 --> 01:53:00.000
I was up at your semedy and this guy, I was coming out from a hike from a pretty good

1793
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.56
hike a couple days out in the boat. And there was a guy and he was using the middle of the river

1794
01:53:06.56 --> 01:53:11.60
like sitting on the rock just to calm river, not like you know, he's sitting on the rock. And we

1795
01:53:11.60 --> 01:53:17.76
stopped there. I think we jumped in and you know, he saw me and he was all, you know, I could tell

1796
01:53:17.76 --> 01:53:22.000
he was in the game. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he comes over and he was like, I said, man, you know,

1797
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.36
he said, oh man, I lost your podcast bro, we were listening to all the news with one of his

1798
01:53:25.36 --> 01:53:28.80
news. We were listening all the way up here. We just drove six hours to get up here. We just

1799
01:53:28.80 --> 01:53:36.64
into whatever it was of 48 and 49 back to back. You know, I was a man that's awesome. I was like, what

1800
01:53:36.64 --> 01:53:41.44
do you do in up here? You climb in? You guys gonna go hiking? He goes, no man, I just came up here to get my

1801
01:53:41.44 --> 01:53:47.12
mind right and I was like, you don't even know what that means. Did it? Yeah, well, I guess I do know what

1802
01:53:47.12 --> 01:53:53.28
it means. I kind of go up there and get your mind right. Yeah, take it. And if you want supplementation

1803
01:53:53.28 --> 01:53:58.48
for doing that discipline boom, pre-mission mind, your mind literally will get your mind right.

1804
01:53:58.48 --> 01:54:07.12
Yeah, pre-mission. Get your mind right. That's the origin main.com. Yeah, that's where you get it.

1805
01:54:07.12 --> 01:54:11.44
Also, you're going to support yourself. You want to represent Jaco as a store. It's called

1806
01:54:11.44 --> 01:54:16.80
JacoStore. So you go to JacoStore.com. So you can represent huge ten. Huge ten,

1807
01:54:16.80 --> 01:54:20.88
represent a lot of people representing and this is one of those things. So basically, this is where you

1808
01:54:20.88 --> 01:54:27.20
get shirts and in hoodies and hats, rash guards, trucker hats, by the way, I don't have to get the

1809
01:54:27.20 --> 01:54:32.72
flex if you don't have, if you don't want to. If you don't have for for keeping it old school,

1810
01:54:32.72 --> 01:54:40.000
like what you said to do a broom. I'm sure. I think I've worn trucker hats before on a real basis.

1811
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.92
I never saw you to hat until like three minutes ago when you put one on it's momentarily

1812
01:54:43.92 --> 01:54:50.32
and I looked up and I just got disturbed. Yeah, well, it's been literally like like 15 years before

1813
01:54:50.96 --> 01:54:56.24
since I've and your head doesn't get a beat down by the sun. Well, I'm very brown. Yeah. And I'm from

1814
01:54:56.24 --> 01:55:00.64
quite some, I think I'm used to that one. Yeah. But you actually know, dance your question?

1815
01:55:00.64 --> 01:55:05.04
Yeah, sometimes if I stay in the sun for a long time, do you want to have no pull on? Maybe

1816
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:11.28
straw hat. Something. Coconut, coconut leaf. Oh, yeah. Something we used to do.

1817
01:55:13.12 --> 01:55:17.68
Nonetheless, when you're representing JacoStore, when I see people representing in the wild,

1818
01:55:17.68 --> 01:55:21.52
who made that up in the wild without you said that or something? I think someone else said that.

1819
01:55:21.52 --> 01:55:25.68
I don't know, but I definitely, I think I might have said it because I think the first,

1820
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:30.32
no, I did say it because I remember I hadn't seen one in the wild. Right. And that's something.

1821
01:55:30.32 --> 01:55:34.24
Yeah, I've been like, I never saw a trooper in the wild and they eventually I did it. And now

1822
01:55:34.24 --> 01:55:38.16
man, I was in the airport yesterday. I saw like seven people. They weren't wearing shirts,

1823
01:55:38.16 --> 01:55:43.12
but they were all coming up and being like, hey, what's up? So people were fired up.

1824
01:55:43.12 --> 01:55:48.000
You know, wild. Yeah. But yeah, good. Go there, get something. You know, if you want to

1825
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:53.44
represent and represent in the wild, boom, and it's a plenty of clothes for you to. Where's that? Anyway,

1826
01:55:53.44 --> 01:55:59.28
yeah, JacoStore, I made a new discipline equals freedom shirt. Yes. It's, it's a little bit cooler in my opinion.

1827
01:55:59.28 --> 01:56:02.88
Well, you know, it's one of these things. That might be biased because I sort of,

1828
01:56:02.88 --> 01:56:09.12
you know, some influence that one. No one. Yeah. Yeah. It was good. You did. You, when you,

1829
01:56:10.32 --> 01:56:15.92
when I told you, hey, make equals smaller. Yeah. And I could see in your mind,

1830
01:56:15.92 --> 01:56:22.72
you were thinking it's off balance, off balance physically, physically, letters. Yeah. And then I gave you

1831
01:56:22.72 --> 01:56:29.76
the idea of hey, know you put two lines. It's an equal sign. There's layers here. You got all

1832
01:56:29.76 --> 01:56:34.96
it's, it was like a done deal in your mind. It's, it's Nirvana had been achieved from new t-shirts.

1833
01:56:34.96 --> 01:56:42.000
Well, you did click because, and I saw why you, one of the equals small. Yeah, because that's not

1834
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.20
because they're things. Yeah. This one. This one. This one. Nonetheless,

1835
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:52.56
he went jocostory.com. You want to represent the main thing to represent. Yeah. Not the equals. Well,

1836
01:56:52.56 --> 01:56:58.24
equals is, it's, it's all equal. I'll tell you that it's not the main thing. Yeah. All right. There you go.

1837
01:56:58.24 --> 01:57:03.20
So, jocostory. That problem, not that it was a problem. But, you know, he being, being influenced

1838
01:57:03.20 --> 01:57:09.28
with his improvement. Yeah. Somebody out there's like, no, I like the equals being bigger.

1839
01:57:09.28 --> 01:57:14.48
Echo shirt was better. Equality. Boom. Yeah. Very, equality. Like the, like the, like the

1840
01:57:14.48 --> 01:57:18.48
freedom that like the freedom does it, as a, as a discipline. Yeah. And the versatility was kind of the

1841
01:57:18.48 --> 01:57:22.000
deal. That's the deal. And I did it. They're going to have to keep in their old school shirt. Yeah.

1842
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.56
Yeah. Yeah. Representing. Get another way. Yeah. Whatever, man. All good. All good. Also,

1843
01:57:26.56 --> 01:57:32.88
good way to stay on the path. The current path is to subscribe to this podcast if you have not already.

01:57:39.12 --> 01:57:44.96
platforms, apps, whatever, you listen to your podcast, man, subscribe. Leave a review if you feel

1846
01:57:44.96 --> 01:57:51.12
like it. And also don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast, which we just released 17 and 18

1847
01:57:52.16 --> 01:57:59.28
all at the same time. And I apologize that those took a little while to get out. And my, when I

1848
01:57:59.28 --> 01:58:07.12
came down from my garage gym this morning, got done with the, uh, some, so I squatted today. And I haven't

1849
01:58:07.12 --> 01:58:14.000
been able to squat heavy. I'm not, not like, no, not heavy. Actually, let's straight up. Not heavy.

1850
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:21.12
Because I have, I had back to back, tweak, knee, or tweak back, and then tweak knee. So, I just haven't

1851
01:58:21.12 --> 01:58:27.36
been able to get me to the end of the game. And today's where I'm, man, I couldn't believe squatting

1852
01:58:27.36 --> 01:58:32.40
is hard. Yes. Like if you're not used to it, which I'm not right now. And I, and believe me,

1853
01:58:32.40 --> 01:58:37.20
during the, even when my back was tweaked in my knee was tweaked, I'm still doing pistols. I'm still

1854
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:42.80
doing box jumps. I'm still doing burpees and lunges and even a little kettlebell like type,

1855
01:58:42.80 --> 01:58:48.88
little, you know, movements. So it's not like my legs are just sitting there at your feet on a couch.

1856
01:58:48.88 --> 01:58:55.04
No, they're still in the game over here. But, man, that I just racked up. You asked me what

1857
01:58:55.04 --> 01:58:59.92
heavy. No, I did 225. I did like a few sets of 225. And I was like, and I was doing some stuff in between,

1858
01:58:59.92 --> 01:59:06.88
but still, I couldn't believe that. Yeah. So my point is, if you can squat squat, yeah, if you can

1859
01:59:06.88 --> 01:59:12.32
squat, get squat, get it on, because that just makes you stronger. It's tougher. You do have that.

1860
01:59:12.32 --> 01:59:17.44
It might even make you smarter as far as I can. So, from, no, I read, actually,

1861
01:59:17.44 --> 01:59:22.56
I think about it. I read something about the, the, the neurotropic release that happens when you

1862
01:59:22.56 --> 01:59:27.92
squat, you know, body gets better. Well, that's exercise in resistance exercise in, you know,

1863
01:59:27.92 --> 01:59:31.92
actually a lot of kind of exercises in general. Yeah. Kind of resquadding your using like a lot of

1864
01:59:31.92 --> 01:59:36.64
it does more. It's true. It ups your testosterone too. There you go. Because, and here's why basically,

1865
01:59:36.64 --> 01:59:40.48
because it's a huge muscle group. That's why. Oh, yeah. So, and it's not just one muscle group,

1866
01:59:40.48 --> 01:59:44.56
because when you're squatting, you're actually using, I think when you're squatting, you're using so many

1867
01:59:44.56 --> 01:59:50.72
muscles. Much. Yeah. Makes you kind of core stabilizers. And that's not to mention the biggest muscles in

1868
01:59:50.72 --> 01:59:56.24
your body. And with basically all your big muscles, all of them, not just one big one and then

1869
01:59:56.24 --> 01:59:59.60
a little bit of small ones. Like, you know, most of your body, that's kind of how it is. You know,

1870
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:04.000
you're using your, your shoulders. And then you're trying to have a little bit of your chest.

1871
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.64
Right. So, tell the other day that the condos, the condos. Yeah. That's what I was going to do.

1872
02:00:08.64 --> 02:00:13.68
Yeah. That's anything else I go. Okay. Right. Right. Right. There you go. Yeah. Get some.

1873
02:00:13.68 --> 02:00:17.44
Everyone should have. If you're, if you have a hotel, if you're a hotel owner, get some

1874
02:00:17.44 --> 02:00:21.84
condos in there. Get some condos. You don't even have to get. You can get, because they're

1875
02:00:21.84 --> 02:00:28.72
normally stop at 50s. If you get, let's just say 50s. If you just get a set of 70s and a set of

1876
02:00:28.72 --> 02:00:34.08
condos, we'll be good. Yeah. We'll be good worldwide. Yeah. The world will be happy. Yeah. You'll be

1877
02:00:34.08 --> 02:00:38.08
especially happy because I know you liked them. You were saying, we're all fired up the other day

1878
02:00:38.08 --> 02:00:43.92
talking about dumbbells. Yeah. Do you like them? Well, because it's a fun exercise. There's more

1879
02:00:43.92 --> 02:00:48.96
to it than just getting under the bench, for example, and pushing the bench. You know, it's,

1880
02:00:48.96 --> 02:00:51.52
I mean, there's more a little bit more to bench than that when you get into it. But

1881
02:00:51.52 --> 02:00:55.52
dumbbells, like you got it. Okay. You got to pick those guys up. One in each hand. Then you got to

1882
02:00:55.52 --> 02:00:59.60
balance them on your knees and then you got to get them up there into position. That's right. There's

1883
02:00:59.60 --> 02:01:03.44
a whole thing. Exactly. And that's not to mention the strength you got to have to push them. So,

1884
02:01:03.44 --> 02:01:07.60
you know, when you get kind of good at them and you do them a lot, it does become kind of fun.

1885
02:01:07.60 --> 02:01:12.64
Jack, there you go. Boom. Nonetheless, I don't know how we started talking about dumbbells. Well,

1886
02:01:12.64 --> 02:01:18.16
Jocco squatting is laser sore, all this stuff. And then, oh yeah, and then warrior kid podcast,

1887
02:01:18.16 --> 02:01:22.48
how did that lead to it? I don't know. But you know, every, that's how you look at it. Because when I came home,

1888
02:01:22.48 --> 02:01:27.04
oh yeah, because, oh, this was going to say my wife was listening to warrior kid podcast this

1889
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:32.88
morning when I came down from the, from the gym. And she was all smiles. And she said,

1890
02:01:32.88 --> 02:01:38.08
well, this story is very good. Darling. So, that's a little uncle Jake story here, you know? And she

1891
02:01:38.08 --> 02:01:43.28
starts naming the people. She said, oh, is this this person? Because the stories that Uncle Jake

1892
02:01:43.28 --> 02:01:49.92
tells, there's, they're not, they're not, uh, what's they're not nonfiction stories, right? Like,

1893
02:01:49.92 --> 02:01:55.92
but there's the basis. The story comes by. Yeah, that's what is it based on the true story?

1894
02:01:55.92 --> 02:02:00.32
Well, there's based and then there's inspired by true events. That's like, they're probably,

1895
02:02:00.32 --> 02:02:04.96
they're, well, which one is the less true inspired by true events? So, I say they're inspired by

1896
02:02:05.76 --> 02:02:11.76
inspired by true events. But they're not, they're not based on, although the one that just came out,

1897
02:02:11.76 --> 02:02:16.16
me being out in a rowboat in the middle of a lake and the horse fall through the orlocks. That happened.

1898
02:02:16.16 --> 02:02:20.40
That's, I guess what I had no life jacket. Is that smart? No. So kids got to learn about that.

1899
02:02:20.40 --> 02:02:24.24
I got to learn about that. He prepared. Yeah. Don't, don't take those shortcuts.

1900
02:02:24.24 --> 02:02:29.44
agree. Anyways, that's the warrior kid podcast. Good. You can you can listen to those. And you

1901
02:02:29.44 --> 02:02:35.44
talked about YouTube. Yeah. If you're on the YouTube channel, echo as put puts out,

1902
02:02:35.44 --> 02:02:43.04
he puts out videos and they're enhanced. We'll say. Yeah, they're enhanced. Also, just a regular

1903
02:02:43.04 --> 02:02:46.80
video version of the podcast and little excerpts that are not enhanced. They're just chopped up. Yeah,

1904
02:02:46.80 --> 02:02:51.04
for consumption. I think we should have more of those too. By the way. Yeah, I put one up today.

1905
02:02:51.60 --> 02:02:57.12
I'll put more. We'll do that every day. I think. That'd be good. Right. Appropriate. Let's say appropriate.

1906
02:02:57.68 --> 02:03:01.12
Yeah, you might have to edit it a more. The one I think, the one, it was the one you just put

1907
02:03:01.12 --> 02:03:07.76
up today, like 10 minutes or 11 minutes long. I forget too long. It was how to stay in shape when you travel.

1908
02:03:07.76 --> 02:03:12.64
Yeah. So it should be like this. How to stay in shape when you travel. Do burpees in your hotel room.

1909
02:03:12.64 --> 02:03:18.16
Get some. I think people need more information. No, no, no.

1910
02:03:18.16 --> 02:03:23.76
Yeah. Also, hey, warrior kids, speaking of warrior kids, get the go to Irish Oaks Ranch.com. We got

1917
02:03:56.72 --> 02:04:02.56
$1 for one banana, which I know is kind of expensive. But one dollar for one banana or $5 for a banana,

1918
02:04:02.56 --> 02:04:06.96
a bag of bananas for I think there's like, I don't know, eight or 10 bananas in there. So you know,

1919
02:04:06.96 --> 02:04:12.56
the whole deal. Yep. We'll make somebody. I dig it. But let's face it. You can give bananas literally on the

1925
02:04:38.08 --> 02:04:43.04
bananas. Yeah. More or less. I mean, maybe a little bit more value than a rock. But it's still. Yes,

1941
02:06:02.56 --> 02:06:06.56
psychological warfare iTunes, Google play. We're coming out with a second one. We're going to try

02:06:18.72 --> 02:06:25.60
Yeah. Yes. Okay. I'll try smoke. I'll think about smoking. I don't. I've never smoked. So it's a

1945
02:06:25.60 --> 02:06:30.56
little hard for me to relate to. Right. But I made you just to straight up addiction addiction.

1946
02:06:30.56 --> 02:06:33.92
Yeah. What are you addicted to? Because everybody's addicted to something. Yeah. You know,

1947
02:06:33.92 --> 02:06:39.12
some people are addicted to cocaine. Some people are addicted to alcohol. Some people are addicted to

1948
02:06:39.12 --> 02:06:45.28
sugar. Some people are addicted to drama. That's what's going to say. Right. Yeah. People are

1949
02:06:45.28 --> 02:06:50.08
addicted to drama. Yeah. So people do want about that. But yeah. That's psychological warfare.

1950
02:06:50.80 --> 02:06:55.20
And you get on iTunes and Google play and all that stuff. What is psychological

1951
02:06:55.20 --> 02:06:58.56
warfare? No. And everybody is. All right. Well, if you hit a moment of weakness,

1952
02:06:58.56 --> 02:07:02.32
boom, listen to psychological warfare and get you past it. That's what it is. Boom. Also,

1953
02:07:02.32 --> 02:07:08.56
speaking of weakness and your workouts workout weakness real weakness physically. That's whatever.

1954
02:07:09.28 --> 02:07:12.48
Anyway, you had a plateau and your workout gets some new equipment. That's what I did.

1955
02:07:12.48 --> 02:07:17.36
I got rings get it from on it on it dot com slash jockel. I got rings and kettle bells.

1956
02:07:17.36 --> 02:07:19.92
Actually, that was a long time ago. I got the kettle bells. But I'm glad I did.

1957
02:07:21.12 --> 02:07:25.84
Again, the rings battle ropes like stuff you can vary it at very it up and create little

1958
02:07:25.84 --> 02:07:29.84
challenges for yourself within the workout. I know that's what kind of what it work out is. But

1959
02:07:29.84 --> 02:07:34.72
you know, when it gets mundane. No. You don't see it. Actually, I think you do know when it

1960
02:07:34.72 --> 02:07:38.48
gets mundane because for you, it is mundane. You just, I think that's part of your challenge. I think

1961
02:07:38.48 --> 02:07:43.76
that's your challenge. Yeah. Yeah. You exercise. I make up my workouts a lot more than you think I do.

1962
02:07:43.76 --> 02:07:48.32
Yeah. Sometimes I do squats and then sometimes I do fronts squats.

1963
02:07:50.64 --> 02:07:55.92
Well, there you go. You heard it here. First folks. Like I said, on it dot com slash jockel.

1964
02:07:55.92 --> 02:08:01.04
And then you get some tea. A lot of people been asking where to get the cans.

1965
02:08:01.68 --> 02:08:07.04
The ready to drink RTD. That's a thing that you start learning when you like get into this kind of thing.

1966
02:08:07.04 --> 02:08:13.68
What? The like the industry. Yeah. Turn around. It's RTD. Ready to drink. So if you want

1967
02:08:14.56 --> 02:08:19.92
jockel white tea in a can, this is another thing. One day in the world, it's going to be like,

1968
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:24.24
hey, I'm driving out of long drive. I'm going to stop at this 7-11 here. I'm going to go in there.

1969
02:08:24.24 --> 02:08:30.72
They're going to have a job instead of having to get a horrible chemical filled, crappy, sugar,

1970
02:08:30.72 --> 02:08:37.44
psycho drink. I'm going to get something that is literally good for me. Jockel white tea.

1971
02:08:38.32 --> 02:08:45.04
And then that's what's going to happen. But until then, it's on Amazon. It's on Amazon Prime. Why

1972
02:08:45.04 --> 02:08:50.48
is that? Because freaking it weighs a lot. So to save money for you on the shipping,

1973
02:08:51.28 --> 02:08:55.76
you can get the Amazon Prime and it just comes to your house. And it's awesome. And the obvious

1974
02:08:55.76 --> 02:09:00.96
benefit and everyone knows already is that once you drink jockel white tea, you can deadlift

1975
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:07.68
a minimum of 8,000 pounds, including Jordan Peterson. Who overcame his plateau of 7,000 pounds?

1976
02:09:07.68 --> 02:09:13.20
You know, let's get it. I'm self-right up there to 8,000 pounds. Got some books too. Yeah.

1977
02:09:13.20 --> 02:09:16.88
Books. Way to worry kid. Okay. Mark's mission. Mark's mission is the second one. Yes.

1978
02:09:16.88 --> 02:09:22.48
Way to worry kid. And then way to worry kid. Mark's mission. I told you I read this to my daughter

1979
02:09:22.48 --> 02:09:26.96
every night. Right. Yes. Now, well, every, here's the thing. When I said it every night, it's like

1980
02:09:26.96 --> 02:09:32.32
pretty much every night. It seems like we do other quizzes and stuff. But now she's in kindergarten

1981
02:09:32.32 --> 02:09:36.40
now. And now there's a thing where they require, they don't require. But it's the only

1982
02:09:36.40 --> 02:09:41.68
they recommend. Yeah. Uh, per night. So I just do one chapter night, boom, boom, boom, boom. And she

1983
02:09:41.68 --> 02:09:47.76
got so into, she's into this second one a lot a lot more. Because I mean, not that she wasn't

1984
02:09:47.76 --> 02:09:51.28
because the first one is kind of like ethos now because I read it more than once to her. So maybe

1985
02:09:51.28 --> 02:09:55.92
that has a lot to do. Yeah. You might go back. Yeah. She's into the new one because it's new. Yeah.

1986
02:09:55.92 --> 02:09:58.72
At some point, you're going to go back to the original one and she's going to start

1987
02:09:59.84 --> 02:10:05.20
me even like me when I read like I was reading about face the other night for the 47,000th

1988
02:10:05.20 --> 02:10:11.44
time. And you're like, you just get more stuff out of it. Yeah. And I think those books, those warrior

1989
02:10:11.44 --> 02:10:16.000
kid books, that's what's going to happen. Like when she turned six, she's going to read it again.

1990
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.28
When she turned seven, she's going to go like, oh, yeah. But it gets discipline equals freedom.

1991
02:10:19.28 --> 02:10:25.52
No, that means right now. Right. Yeah. When she's going to figure that out. Yeah. Nathan James.

1992
02:10:25.52 --> 02:10:30.32
Yeah. This makes it extra fun because I know who Nathan James is. You know, same like I know

1993
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:35.68
the thing. So that makes it. It's like extra fun. Where she really like any time he comes up.

1994
02:10:35.68 --> 02:10:39.12
Because you know how it kind of each chapter goes back and forth. One is like him at camp and what

1995
02:10:39.12 --> 02:10:42.16
happened. Then the other one is like him starting business and when in back to camp and doing the

1996
02:10:42.16 --> 02:10:46.56
so it's like that. Right. So every time we go back to Nathan James, she perks up. Like with everything.

1997
02:10:46.56 --> 02:10:52.000
So we're at the part where, you know, how he's doing recon. Right. It's finding out. Yeah.

1998
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.84
Finding out Nathan James. Yeah. And she's finding out that part and then like she's really

1999
02:10:55.84 --> 02:11:00.24
because we tell her that we we still tell that all the time. Not everybody has a TV in the room.

2000
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:05.52
Not everybody has like all this XYZ good stuff and whatever. So she really like it. It was like

2001
02:11:05.52 --> 02:11:10.32
she was familiar with the concept. So she really just attached to it. Yeah. But yeah, for some reason,

2002
02:11:10.32 --> 02:11:14.40
I don't know because I make my voice like how you make your voice on wherever. When I make Nathan

2003
02:11:14.40 --> 02:11:20.16
James, I think that's part of it too. Do I do Nathan James in the audio? No, but no, no, no.

2004
02:11:20.16 --> 02:11:25.68
No, when you know how you make your voice when you imitate somebody's dark or whatever, you know,

2005
02:11:25.68 --> 02:11:30.000
you're not. But Nathan James is in the dark. No, I know, but I make my voice like Nathan James.

2006
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.60
Because I try to make him sound annoying because he's annoying. Oh, God. Okay. But yeah. Anyway,

2007
02:11:35.60 --> 02:11:39.44
it's a very dope way that we're the real. Okay. I got the real thumbs up. On the podcast.

2008
02:11:39.44 --> 02:11:47.36
I know him. Can we? Yeah. He was down here. But I was okay. We can do this. He was just busy

2009
02:11:47.36 --> 02:11:52.88
and he goes, let's wait until I get this thing taken care of and then we'll do it. And I said, cool.

2010
02:11:52.88 --> 02:11:58.72
No, so we're going to do it. Yeah. The real Nathan James. Also, discipline equals freedom,

2011
02:11:58.72 --> 02:12:03.92
field manual. Best kind of manual there is, by the way, field manual. That's my opinion. This is how to

2012
02:12:03.92 --> 02:12:09.44
you know how you have a basic structure slash backbone and just how to be. You know what,

2013
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:14.56
what were you looking for? Operating system. Operating system. Yeah. Yeah. There's your operating system.

2014
02:12:14.56 --> 02:12:19.92
Perfect. Perfect. That's your. So it's like boom, you read it. Cool. I got a general thing, but you can

2015
02:12:19.92 --> 02:12:26.32
kind of have it. I refer to. Everyone's in the world. It's pretty cool to get feedback on that book.

2016
02:12:26.32 --> 02:12:35.28
Yeah. And have people that get completely on the path from that book and then more important.

2017
02:12:35.28 --> 02:12:41.44
They stay on the path from that book. Is it possible that a book has that much of an impact? The answer is

2018
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:45.76
the yes. Yeah. And it seems weird to say that. I mean, it does. And it seems weird for me to say that.

2019
02:12:45.76 --> 02:12:51.28
But there's that is 100% true. Yeah. It's 100% true. Yeah. And I'll tell you what. I mean, do you

2020
02:12:51.28 --> 02:12:57.04
do you read it? Yeah. I mean, I know you. Yes. So I mean, so I was going to say it may not make sense for you,

2021
02:12:57.04 --> 02:13:02.64
but it will make it perfect sense to you. Where, you know, like, there's a lot of good books out there. You told

2022
02:13:02.64 --> 02:13:06.88
like good books and there, you know, but you read them and they're kind of long and they have the, you know,

2023
02:13:06.88 --> 02:13:11.60
they're really laid out very well and there's like, they go into detail, which is good. That's kind of what a good

2024
02:13:11.60 --> 02:13:18.64
book kind of does. Right. This one kind of violates that ruin away because it's super basic. But that's why in my opinion,

2025
02:13:18.64 --> 02:13:24.88
like, when I go back to it, I can just go back to it and boom, it's all like in there. I don't have to read like 10 or 20 or 30 pages.

2026
02:13:24.88 --> 02:13:30.56
Nothing to say for. Yeah. You know, so it's like fundamental first person just drawn in your face. Yeah.

2027
02:13:31.28 --> 02:13:38.64
Good reminder. And you got extreme ownership for combat leadership principles that you can use in your

2028
02:13:38.64 --> 02:13:44.64
business and life, written might be in my brother, Laith Babin. And we have a follow-up to that book coming out.

2029
02:13:44.64 --> 02:13:51.84
It's called the dichotomy leadership. You need to, if you want to get first edition, which, which you do,

2030
02:13:51.84 --> 02:13:58.56
hey, somebody at camp gave me a first edition of Ernie Piles book,

2031
02:14:00.16 --> 02:14:08.40
brave men first edition. Yeah. How awesome is that? So that feeling that that feeling right there

2032
02:14:08.40 --> 02:14:14.56
of like, I got the first edition of this book, brave men. That's the one where he's talking about

2033
02:14:14.56 --> 02:14:19.20
the rumbling coming in the noise is building and he just know what it is and he looks up in the sky. He's like,

2034
02:14:19.20 --> 02:14:24.000
it was the heavy. Yeah. Probably one of my favorite quotes. Yeah.

2035
02:14:25.44 --> 02:14:32.64
And I have the first edition of that book now. So dichotomy of leadership. Of course, what's the

2036
02:14:32.64 --> 02:14:37.92
publisher doing? Cotton Corners. Hey, we can get away. Oh, yeah. They're being conservative. Yeah. And of course,

2037
02:14:37.92 --> 02:14:41.52
they're going to do that. They're going to do that because that's just what they do. That's what

2038
02:14:41.52 --> 02:14:46.96
they're, their, their gamble is. They, they make their little predictions and that's what they get.

2039
02:14:46.96 --> 02:14:51.76
That's what they're doing. They'd rather, they'd rather, they'd rather, they'd rather,

2040
02:14:51.76 --> 02:14:56.16
actually underestimate, have a little demand for the book and have a little spike and a little

2041
02:14:56.16 --> 02:15:01.44
buzz about that. So they, they would rather, they'd be less first edition or rather have more

2042
02:15:01.44 --> 02:15:09.76
people walking around with the fourth edition. That's all lame. So anyway, yeah, dichotomy leadership

2043
02:15:09.76 --> 02:15:15.36
coming out September 25th. If you want to get on that thing, you can preorder it wherever you

2044
02:15:15.36 --> 02:15:21.20
preorder books. You can preorder it. And then got a leadership consulting company called

2045
02:15:21.20 --> 02:15:29.68
echelon front where we solve problems through leadership. What kind of problems? All of them.

2046
02:15:29.68 --> 02:15:33.68
Because every problem that you have inside your organization is a leadership problem. I'm here to tell

2047
02:15:33.68 --> 02:15:37.76
you straight up factually. No matter what the problem is, it's a leadership problem. And I know that

2048
02:15:37.76 --> 02:15:42.48
might hurt because guess who the leader is, you're the leader or your subordinate leaders. They're

2049
02:15:42.48 --> 02:15:48.08
not doing what they're supposed to do. You need to get them on board with the program. You're not

2050
02:15:48.08 --> 02:15:53.04
making the bottom line. Guess what guess what kind of problem that is? It's not a money problem.

2051
02:15:53.04 --> 02:15:59.04
It's a leadership problem. Productions not meet and it's quota. Is that a production problem?

2052
02:15:59.04 --> 02:16:04.16
It's a leadership problem. So no matter what problems you're having and your organization, they

2053
02:16:04.16 --> 02:16:13.92
get solved through leadership. It's me. It's life. It's JP, Dave, Flynn, and Mike. And if you want us to

2054
02:16:13.92 --> 02:16:20.24
come and work with your company, don't call us speaking agency, just go to echelonfront.com.

2055
02:16:20.24 --> 02:16:30.08
And we will show up and crush. Master 006 might be sold out by the time this gets released.

2056
02:16:30.08 --> 02:16:37.84
But if you want to come, we talk leadership intensely and granularly for two days. It's in San Francisco,

2057
02:16:37.84 --> 02:16:46.24
October 17th and 18th, you can register for that at extremotorship.com. Same with the roll call.

2058
02:16:47.04 --> 02:16:51.76
I think we're done. Let me ask about the roll call. Let me ask you the roll call is when this podcast

2059
02:16:51.76 --> 02:16:56.08
comes out. I don't think they'll be any more seats. So for the master and the roll, this is the

2060
02:16:56.08 --> 02:17:01.60
first roll call. So I don't know. But for the master, what percentage of, let's say your typical

2061
02:17:01.60 --> 02:17:07.84
group of people that come or whatever, what's the percentage of appeal wise? What's the percentage

2062
02:17:07.84 --> 02:17:14.32
of just so there's information? Perfect. You know, good guidance. And then there's just to hang.

2063
02:17:15.36 --> 02:17:20.88
Like, let's, you know, like, if you look at the days, the days we go from eight in the morning

2064
02:17:20.88 --> 02:17:27.92
until four o'clock in the afternoon and on the first day and then the second day, we go

2065
02:17:28.16 --> 02:17:35.60
eight in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon or maybe two, thirty. And to answer your

2066
02:17:35.60 --> 02:17:41.84
question, we start, we muster with everyone at 445 in the morning. So we that whole time

2067
02:17:41.84 --> 02:17:46.96
the eat and then when we get done at five, we hang out until nine or ten, that night. And then the

2068
02:17:46.96 --> 02:17:52.64
next day, same thing, four, 45 in the morning and then we go to Jitu at night. And so yeah, I mean,

2069
02:17:52.64 --> 02:17:57.84
where they're the whole time. Yeah, you will 100% hang out. Yeah, that's what I mean. All of us.

2070
02:17:57.84 --> 02:18:02.32
Like, you're like, that's your question. Yeah, a percentage of you hanging out and

2071
02:18:03.76 --> 02:18:09.12
is 100%. Yeah, that's part of the appeal, right? Because you say, yeah, we muster at 445. But

2072
02:18:09.12 --> 02:18:13.20
you, one could think from the outside, hey, that's a workout. But here's the thing. Yeah,

2073
02:18:13.20 --> 02:18:17.60
that's a workout, but it's kind of fun. You know, just talking trash and you know, afterwards,

2074
02:18:17.60 --> 02:18:22.32
we kind of, you know, and it's kind of a hang until it starts at eight and then beat, you know,

2075
02:18:22.32 --> 02:18:25.92
the, the, the brakes that you take or whatever. It's like, oh, yeah, you're kind of a

2076
02:18:25.92 --> 02:18:29.60
one. Yeah, you don't take some break. Yeah, you guys, we don't take breaks. We just

2077
02:18:29.60 --> 02:18:36.32
answer questions. We talk to people. We take pictures, sign books, whatever. Yeah, and that kind of

2078
02:18:36.32 --> 02:18:40.48
happens throughout the whole time. And then after it's sort of wrapped, I painted myself into

2079
02:18:40.48 --> 02:18:44.40
a, painted the whole team into a corner. Oh, I totally did. Because it's a little bit

2080
02:18:44.40 --> 02:18:48.000
heavy. I was like, look, they're not going to be any green room. We're not going back stage.

2081
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:51.20
We're going to be out there the whole time. So, I guess what we do, there's no green room. There's

2082
02:18:51.20 --> 02:18:56.88
no backstage. We're out there the whole time. It's like, like, two 20 hour days is what it is.

2083
02:18:56.88 --> 02:19:00.24
Yeah. Because four hours, we get some sleep. You're like, yeah, oh, yeah, you don't want to

2084
02:19:00.24 --> 02:19:03.92
green room. Okay. Now you can't have a good idea. Exactly. That's how it goes down.

2085
02:19:05.52 --> 02:19:09.28
On top of that, like I said, roll call. We're pretty much done with number one.

2086
02:19:09.28 --> 02:19:14.16
You can check and see if there's any openings, but it's probably not looking great right now.

2087
02:19:15.52 --> 02:19:21.12
Maybe we can open up a couple more seats. Anyways, for that as well, register at extremownership.com.

2088
02:19:21.12 --> 02:19:29.76
And now, of course, we have EF Overwatch, we're connecting spec ops and combat aviation leaders

2089
02:19:29.76 --> 02:19:36.72
to companies that need leaders. People are asking, what about guys from conventional forces,

2090
02:19:36.72 --> 02:19:42.16
which the reason we started with combat aviation and spec ops, because that's where we came from.

2091
02:19:42.16 --> 02:19:46.88
And so that's where we have community ties. Now that we actually have, we actually have some

2092
02:19:46.88 --> 02:19:51.04
people coming on the team right now from conventional forces that we work alongside, awesome leaders.

2093
02:19:51.04 --> 02:19:57.04
And so we're looking at how we're going to open this up to the rest of the military and get

2094
02:19:57.04 --> 02:20:01.04
everyone else engaged. Because, guess what, we work this civilian sector all the time.

2095
02:20:01.04 --> 02:20:05.36
I just said problems get solved by leadership. Civilian companies, guess what they need, they need leaders.

2096
02:20:05.36 --> 02:20:10.64
And the military has them. So that's where we're going to, if you want to, enroll in that

2097
02:20:10.64 --> 02:20:14.80
from either side from either a person that wants a job or a person that's looking for leaders. Go to

2098
02:20:14.80 --> 02:20:24.000
EF Overwatch.com. And until we do see you at one of these events or see you in the airport or

2099
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.60
see you on the Jiu-Jitsu mat or see you wherever if you want to interact or give us answers or give us

2100
02:20:29.60 --> 02:20:36.48
questions. You can do that on the interwebs. We are on Twitter, we're on the Instagram. And we're

2101
02:20:36.48 --> 02:20:46.72
also on Facebook. Keep. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and finally to those of you

2102
02:20:46.72 --> 02:20:56.08
who like Peter Nash, Swisher who served in the military or you are serving in the military at this

2103
02:20:56.08 --> 02:21:03.12
time. Thank you for your service and for those that protect us here at home in the police and

2104
02:21:03.12 --> 02:21:07.36
law enforcement and correction officers and firefighters and border patrol and paramedics and

2105
02:21:07.36 --> 02:21:13.20
all other first responders. Thank you for what you do day in and day out and to everyone else

2106
02:21:13.20 --> 02:21:22.000
making your way through the world, working and grinding and building and creating. That's

2107
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:31.68
awesome and keep doing those things and do those things with some intent, some good intent,

2108
02:21:31.68 --> 02:21:42.48
the intent to make yourself better. And when you've got yourself on a good path, then show someone

2109
02:21:42.48 --> 02:21:51.36
else the path help them off that slippery slope. Help them. Because in another time in another place,

2110
02:21:52.72 --> 02:22:03.04
it could be you that needs help. So take the world or that little part of the world that you can

2111
02:22:03.04 --> 02:22:11.92
take it into your trembling hand and help. Help yourself become better, help others become better,

2112
02:22:13.12 --> 02:22:22.96
and in doing so. Help this strange and off and hostile world that we live and make it just a

2113
02:22:22.96 --> 02:22:31.60
little bit better by getting out there and getting after it. And until next time,

2114
02:22:31.60 --> 02:22:37.28
this is echo and juggle out.
