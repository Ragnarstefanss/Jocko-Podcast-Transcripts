and I'm thinking you get 200% where you know those guys where it's like man what they don't want to roll with certain guys You know like it's everyone sees it everyone sees what you're doing Marines mitigate weaknesses by leveraging their strengths to form new understanding and focus on learning to eliminate gaps This can only occur when learners first acknowledge their weaknesses and resolve to leverage their strengths to build meaningful connections Should we make a poster that says that you know I mean like just so important and so seemingly obvious and once again You wonder why someone would have to take something so seemingly obvious and put it into a book It's because even though it's seemingly obvious it's hard for people to do Next section is called the expeditionary nature of learning Marines recognize that to be effective war fighters They must be warrior scholars They must seize initiative to study the profession of arms whenever and wherever learning opportunities arise And once again, I like I like how the the Marine Corps manuals just state things as a matter of fact If you're a Marine then you obviously recognize that you need to be a warrior scholar. And it's talking about force on force exercises to simulate wars complexity force on force exercises are purpose driven learning environments that are approximate the complexity of war When developing such exercises Marines focus on designs that enhance problem solving and promote decision forcing events This enables Marines to practice and better understand how to get inside the enemies decision making process There is no substitute for fighting against a competent realistic thinking adaptive enemy Even if that enemy is simulated by other Marines this practice ensures that challenging learning environments provide a place to practice Develop experience allow errors adapt and learn how to fight and win That's the very premise of top gun need this to say That is the very premise of top gun that is the very premise of the advanced seal training where you are in fact fighting against other seals all the time And what's What might be hard for people to grasp and you might even be able to have a more linear exposure to this I could watch a young seal officer Get better at decision making events I could watch a young seal get better at being in chaotic situations Taking a step back, detaching, looking around, figuring out what the possibilities are, choosing a course of action, executing it I could watch someone get better at that It's hard to It can be hard to quantify what that Like what that actually looks like You're going to be ready you're going to be primed you're going to be thinking you're going to be looking for an exit you're going to be looking for an entrance you're going to see what is we're going to size up your target all that's going to happen the second you walk in there if you're not expecting it all it doesn't happen at all. I'd have this feeling like I'm never going to get out of this like situation and I'm probably going to die under here kind of thing but if you're like one time this is what you did you were like. He kept like to and the kind like flagrantly taking like 20 30 seconds to tie his belt they did like six times that's a training time out to the only thing about I think a training time out. They can't do anything you know how many guys I had tonight out of out fighting you how many four you know how many had last night four you know how many had the night before four no change in the number of opt for you're going against What's what's changing is your ability to lead is your your team your subordinate leaders ability to step up and make things happen Your ability to give good guidance your ability to make decisions your ability for your team members to make good decisions because that's the other thing that makes it really drastic is as Eight fire team leaders all of a sudden you know when when they show up two of them are kind of proactively making things happen and then it becomes three It's going to shake out of your hair Is there learning environments there's not a single correct design for creating the ideal learning environment because each learning objective Marine team and condition will differ therefore Marines modify learning environment to most effectively meet their the learners needs and reflect the conditions that they expect to encounter Effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought reasoning and the creation of the potential solutions to the problems and encourages Marines to explore alternative courses of action I had to highlight that part because effective learning requires environments that foster flexibility of thought reasoning and the creation of potential So that so if at top gone what you did was said Okay, Bill on this run you're going to go up you're going to do this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver this maneuver but eventually you got to figure out what maneuver you're going to do when you're going to do it how long you're going to do it for what's your next maneuver going to be Yeah, and what little change is you're going to make to that maneuver in real time because it's not going to be the road application of that maneuver I come out, you know, let's let them come out naturally so they can kind of, you know, through their own evolution kind of manifest themselves kind of thing, you know, and I think after thinking about it, it's like, man, I don't know if that's the best way. So to me I just worked on being that way the whole time 100% at the time because it's easier to like deprive than it is to like prime one year like laid on the priming kind of thing situation in one of the situation arises you know. The most claustrophobic I would get from you is one like you'd be pinning me down and it seemed like this was part of your like tactic to like slowly submit me like. you learn It's going to be a variation of that Trying to expand people's brains and Effective learning in back to the book and effective learning environment enables marines to clearly understand the intended war fighting doctrine concepts tactics techniques procedures and learning outcomes It clearly identifies the expectation for the learners Whether exercising marines critical thinking in problem solving skills or understanding circumstances where a medi'd obedience to orders or Application of specific basic skills such as good marksmanship are required so there's times where you are going to just straight up say Roger that got it I can be like hey like I respect you but this seems like kind of dangerous I'm not kind of training with you specific that's a training time out really. So you can introduce this concept early on and then you know as you evolved in in fighter aviation we have the knock it off which is actually kind of like in someone is kind of like tapping so I can do this fight with you and we're finally if I get to a point where I feel like. And I didn't really think about it, and there is no way I would have thought, could what we were doing now Somehow be helpful somewhere else down the line other than rebased line and Top Gun training for this next aircraft That's what I thought we were doing, that is not what we were doing There was so much more going on there, and the squeezing of my brain is trying to create a much larger context For all these things that I did in those 23 years that I look back and I'm like, dude, if you want this to be useful, you have to think about it a lot more hey you did what you did you did what you did look you're going to be going in the house as you've never been in before that's the whole goal of this that you can go in a room you've never been before and you're going to react how you react we need to understand why you're reacting that way if it's if there's a better way to do it let's think about it. How can you get yourself primed you know I talk about leadership strategy and tactics there's a list of 12 things to do as a leader and like look you can't read this list of 12 things to be like okay good cool now. but I'm telling you I'm trying to tell you what it looks like It looked like this why I think you might be able to give a better example You'd see a young seal day one going through land warfare training Yeah, that makes sense because it's like, you know, that's the whole thing with like, like sandbags. is that we do not gain all our experience at once, but by degrees So our determinations continue to be assailed, incessantly, by fresh experience And the mind, if we may use the expression, must always be under arms So new things are going to come about and you got to be, he's using, he's using kind of a different metaphor I'm saying keep your mind open, he's like you got to be ready ready to adapt, keep your mind under pressure There's a gap that you got to be able to fill that's that's what this is all about the gap is I'm I can get primed for so much I can think about what I'm going to do and how I'm going to act and I'm going to make this call and if somebody confronts my ego I'm going to detach but then. You're going to get you're going to get you're going to do that but just by asking the question and you and I almost knew what you're going to say was hey just tell me why you did that it doesn't mean that they're still right. Think about that, just think about that concept in GJ2 When you get, when you get immobilized, you are on the way to defeat the minute that you can no longer move, you are on your way to defeat Well, on the battlefield, if you can't maneuver anymore, if you dig in and you can't move, you're on your way to defeat, and mentally, if you close your mind and you stop thinking and seeing other perspectives and keeping an open mind, you are on your way to defeat So when you start taking these and seeing them in other areas, it opens your mind up, it frees your mind in so many different ways and that is learning, that's what it is All right, little preamble You know you're going to have a high level you just to put your out of shape and you're going with the monster guy who's who's really good at you to get in the better you you're guessing you're like you're getting you can beat down is what Like if you can set it up that way that you're not trying to teach them advanced physics before, but when there's no application for it, but then when they get to a point where you can start to say, hey, you want to check out, you want to know what the tide's going to do. And how many how many aircraft how many sections would you go out roll out on on a. On a mission that you would train for a top gun and the reason I'm saying that like I like when you talk about and you have multiple aircraft like sort of the FTX scenario the final training exercises. Because I was saying hey you need to set yourself up for surprise things that you're not ready for you actually want to tell like if I want to get ready to defend myself and not freak out I need to tell echo hey man occasionally I want you to just attack me. I was like yelling, like pretending like I was going to yell at Jamie. You know, I was going to hang out and, you know, I guess maybe part of me when I'm kind of thinking back on that whole scenario or a scenario scenario's like it. I would essentially prime myself by doing this and a lot of people do do this they'll like tell me this they'll be like what would jacco do in the situation like anytime a stressful situation came up or decision had to be made they'll be well I would essentially prime myself like if something some stressful situation that's the rule like any stress that comes in some bigger small boom I'm the leader you just you have to essentially prime yourself into being like the leader and what's hard is. Section division a section that's right you'd break them down much like you know fire team squad things like that. but I was a guy kept going going going any kept like we're doing key Yeah and my mental state was kind of like this me gets you know if I'm against any claustrophobic situation like my mind that the battle is different. Although marine strive for learning efficiencies Improving the learning environment does not necessarily mean making it more efficient For example, though rope memorization or reciting fast can be very efficient and useful for developing basic knowledge such as memorizing standing orders They are not effective methods for all learning effective learning often requires approaching material from different perspectives Applying information in context and explaining how why accents occurred in addition to what occurred How many times echo Charles have you heard me say You learn an arm lock from a different professor and from different angles it will make your arm lock better And again it's a spectrum you can get like maybe 10 seconds training time out think about can do or you can give yourself maybe like a minute or guys used to do. It goes to the person who can adapt, who can make intelligent decisions and execute them quickly Skipping ahead in the progress in the progression of learning, training should provide marines with an opposing will to practice against Through repetition and a training environment marines loaned out think adversaries and over-completion Prior to encountering these factors during real world operations Therefore marines must integrate lessons learned from current and previous conflicts to adapt their learning environments, methods, assessments and feedback to reflect evolving threats Got a lot of questions about this one A lot of questions of how do I get my mind ready to do this? And if I just kind of go with the same way I've done it that little role with the ex I've got, like I'll just go back to module B coming like, well, module B doesn't always work for everybody. So that's I was actually I asked Laefals like maybe I should put some kind of negative numbering like you this could actually take you time to bake out to you.
