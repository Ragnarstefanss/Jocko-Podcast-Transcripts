but they don't have the leadership knowledge so that's what's beneficial about things like this podcast like extreme worship like that got to me leadership like putting this information where people can actually read it and understand it they can study because they know their job they know their technical field you know that's another thing with EF overwatch right now is like we're bringing in people that don't necessarily have the technical skill inside of a field but they have the leadership experience and it's a lot easier to teach someone a technical skill that it is to teach the leadership because to get leadership the only way you get better leadership is leadership. but you'll like you'll kind of give me my do like sympathy even with what you say like you'll you'll sympathize like you'll be like hey you're like man that is a bummer or whatever you know whatever the words you say well the thing is if I didn't do that then I you have you won't want to listen to what I'm actually about tell you to do yeah and he's talking about this and this and like being Greg Trin or like not really saying that much stuff he didn't be like two of his excuses um that you know since he's like sort out of shape right or since he's actually going to wait to get back and shape right for him that's what we're asking but when you ask it direct like that it sounds dumb you know and so an example is like if you like if you're a character you know you guys like you use a word wrong or say a word pronounced a word wrong like the guy who's so quick to always correct you in front of people doesn't matter whatever you know you're a character usually those characters people those character people are they're right it's so good now that this you know charity whatever gets the help that they want kind of thing you know what's you know what people underestimate all the time people underestimate how well other people can see what's going on they say I get personally that I see people I say man do you really think that anybody you're fooling anyone and it usually happens it usually happens with people that are well they're obviously they're smart and now you have people doing things that they shouldn't be doing and and and and and I don't necessarily mean they're doing something illegal I'm saying they're doing things that don't support the strategic goals of the company and it's a problem but as those companies grow what they don't realize is just like this book says you have more tools that you can put into place you've got it you've got to communications department inside your company whose job is internal communications so you could be making what you could be making videos and explain to people what's going on and given an update you can you can do all those things you have that capability you have VTCs right you got video calls you can make you you've got subordinate leadership that can go out there and get in the field and make things known so there's a way to overcome these problems if you address them if you don't address them So dichotomy is kind of like rambo where like people are like, oh, I love the dichotomy love, but but the people who know know that first blood is the real movie is the real O.G. One that rambo's not better. unconsciously they perceive it unconsciously or consciously you know it's like you're like I have a dog my dog can kind of know what I'm thinking and that's a damn dog with a brain like a size of a walnut or whatever how big a big a dog's brain is right not big my dog can't speak English I think you posted something like a written thing about how you're like, hey, today's like one of those days where I need more recovery or something like that, basically indicating that you're going to take a rest day or whatever. yeah you know that's a bummer because the thing is I don't like mispronouncing words and yet the corrective measures for not mispronouncing words is for instance if we're going and I'll listen I'm saying something wrong and I'm like hold on let me go back let me interrupt one of my thought pattern let me interrupt what I'm saying to try and figure out if I pronounce this thing right or wrong I lean towards it's better to just flow and get corrected later and then now we have an anger situation now they might listen anything that you're gonna say and now we might ruin a relationship based on the fact that we went too hardcore now to Sam's point if you don't ever indicate any kind of truth then you just let a person continue on a path that bad for them and is bad for their in this case they're wait well and that's not good either but the key component if you have tact and you build a relationship because basically I think I had this conversation with LaFa little while ago you know when you're dealing with someone when you're dealing with a team you're either forwarding and improving the relationship or you know you could be neutral or you're making it go backwards what we want to be doing is improving the relationship at a minimum we want to remain neutral and every other aspect of going backwards in a relationship is bad so if we're business partners and we have a we have a discussion about something I want the result of that discussion to be that our relationship improved and if you live your life thinking that guess what at a minimum people are going to someone's going to know that this is a front if you do that it's kind of like when I told the I've told a bunch of soldiers officers that they had a psycho path in their pontoon and like every if you're if you got 40 you know the ear boss or what someone who outranks you it's not necessarily it's not in the military I don't think but it's like you know this it's like I have a few more letters in my title or something like that or a few more yeah my bus I should do a better job like that guy who emailed me that I'm sorry the last one is unselfishness unselfishness is the study devoidance of caring for or providing for one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others anytime that you as the leader are getting the good deal while your people are getting shafted they notice it and they don't like it they don't like it at all But if you're part of a group involuntarily, you know, so, you know, like, the group's going to be less cohesive if you're like proclaiming that, hey, this is the group. so so Greg sort of leaves and leaves it at that and I'm sitting there like kind of looking at him and I was like but just like all right that's that's not true you know yeah all right leadership techniques it is important to note that in small units the leader can influence and direct his men through close personal contact whereas in large units he must rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate commanders to a system in making his leadership effective the larger the unit the more complex the problems of leadership but the greater the greater become the means available to the commander to assist him in the exercise of his leadership so as you grow problems get more complex but you end up with you have more people you have more tools the larger unit commander must consider carefully the leadership aspect of all basic policies which he prescribes your tolerance You know, some people will be like, they don't like, they start training and they don't like it. no we're not doing that so that's it loyalty trying build that loyalty up and down the chain of command sympathy is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is associated you know I don't like talk about feelings very much actually you don't but the thing in practice like you do that surprisingly good and I don't want to say surprising and I'm there man is I'm like can you hear yourself like that's not even a believable thing you know can you be so exhausted that you can't talk afterwards can you do that especially I'm sure you can if you're ran a foot I don't know hundred I put some, um, like MCT oil and coconut oil, you know, like just a little bit, not like too much with ever. yes they go you know you have this department that they don't know anything about software or nothing like that they don't know about you know so if I'm like so exhausted from training not only is that experience kind of diminished then I'm too exhausted to have like a good conversation go D. He he said it way more like could you laugh at him I would bro if you I wanted him to yeah you're all going to get your own little leadership techniques and what's I'm telling you where I'm really lucky is I've worked with so many different leaders that I just don't know my techniques I say hey you know what's a good thing to do here my buddy bill you stabbing issue with us okay this is a good example when I said hey I'm trying to build a relationship with a boss that's why I'm going to act this way right that's different because that boss is going to say oh he's just trying to butter me up it's like so if I'm like so exhausted you know I like I like training and maybe from like like he's like has an analytical mind you know You know, I like to, you know, if you come at a problem, like, hey, that was my fault. it's like we won't run into miss understanding very often so it's a few years long about not training you did so well that was being without weakness you're talking about like he underestimating under people's reception now was hit that which he has obviously like we all do Because your ego is like, hey, I can't, like, I can't deal with this little, like, short coming in whatever way. no you know eight y'all's get back on the mat he got good quick to that and that's kind of part of the the whole picture you know it's like you're based on what do you think that he will he learned learned anything from you just by being your twin brother like no I have you man that's a rough situation to be in I think what's gonna happen here I mean if you way it out the only real solution is for you to kind of back away from that scenario you know what I mean so I kind of brought you in right made that's going to be that's not going to lead to that's not going to lead to the it's not going to lead to your spouse respecting and listening to what you're saying it's going to lead to your spouse saying oh you're a jerk you don't know how hard it is for me and then they say but uh I think it's black lies what is that but lying by by omission or whatever it's like you know you're telling the truth but you're leaving out stuff to kind of lead them in a certain direction or whatever to make them think certain stuff there's then there's that you know Not that they ever had, but they don't have egos where now, you know, one robot, he's like, hey, I want to be the leader and the other robot, they don't have it like that. so how do you know your job you study another one keep abreast of the latest techniques in the field of communication or facilitate control of your unit and disseminate information three seek out and foster association with capable leaders observe and study their actions and application of leadership techniques for broaden your field of knowledge through association with officers and men of other armed services five seek the opportunity to apply knowledge through exercise a command real leadership is acquired only through constant practice six avoid over specialization into narrow field seven keep abreast of current military developments eight familiarize yourself with capabilities and limitations of all elements of your command by study and through frequent visits to support it's and then when you go to your middle and like it's a dumb like talking kind of behind his back you're like and even you you're sympathy kind of towards me where it may be on the surface you might sort of expect you to be like oh man up or you know something like this Like this is when we're functioning as a group because of this quality, you know, meanwhile, there's like people that have that quality that we're not part of that group. It's like the thing, like, okay, I'm going to send these robots to accomplish this or to take out this or that thing that they're trying to fight for or against or whatever. you think that I'm human and then boom there we go I think it next tacked is the ability to deal with support and since appears in an appropriate manner without giving offense boy that seems like so simple but man tacked people got mad or didn't get mad what did I say I said tacked Trump's the truth on a podcast whenever and some people went all Sam Harris on me and you can you think if you think you can keep leading a 2000 person organization as if you were leading 20 people you're going to have a major issues and it's not going to work it's not going to work back to the book over a period of time the leader will develop techniques of his own which will be better suited to his own personality in which he himself will be able to employ effectively and I I don't like the fact that I mispronounce words and I do it on this podcast on a fairly regular basis and occasionally someone will hit me up and say hey you mispronounce this word that word someone sent me a either an email or something the other day that was like you mispronounce words this would not be that hard to fix you should pay attention or whatever something that was pretty pretty pretty straightforward right and I don't do that but to me everyone does that literally everyone does it and literally everyone is not like less aware how you say like it's like under what you say you under So it's not like this, I mean, no offense to China, but it's not like your typical go to China and you turn it burn these things, you know, no defects or whatever. Like if you mess up everyone else does the bell, the bear crawls you know you and you stand and watch because that's like a psychological punishment to the guy more than the team. You know, that kind of where like, they don't necessarily like insult you back or get mad. my boss told me that one time yeah like straight up like I was this is back in the club dude I think I told you this told you that straight or yeah you've eliminated all non say it because there's no there's no one that's like not at least has some tendency to to be able to kill people right those people are in the pontoon so you've eliminated a bunch of people that have zero chance of being a say this they're not in there so one out of 40's not bad you know when I'll come to you with like this conundrum or you know something going on in my nose or what have you Because like actually that warpath video, that's essentially kind of trying to do the thing is like if you're on the warpath and here's all the things that you're doing. No you're like hey boss got it sounds like good idea So we're very it's been very successful so far and now we're starting to see employers that say they were a little you know your hesitant because you think how do you know anything about whatever I do know if how can someone that's not from this field lead in this field give the person an overview of what the what the field is It's like you just can sort of tell, you know, there's like a dynamic when you joke around with him. So, you know, when you're talking about character, these things are things that in the will to lead, like you're going to be born with some level of those things. but people make that mistake all the time I'm a hypersensitive to what other people are like how they perceive I realize that any facade that I put up is just it's anyone basically anyone can see sure you might fall a couple people but people just look at Like, let's like, you know, you joke around. Kind of like a case when you launch occasionally, but rare occasion, we launch something randomly for like some kind of an event, some kind of a situation for launch the rent. yeah you let her you can let her continue on where we pass on that's not good and ends up in a bad way so so a little bit of credit there but to give a little push back on Sam if you are just straight up a jerk about it well guess what we haven't done what we just talked about which is I haven't built a little bridge and connected and said you know so if he has a question or he hears me talking about something you do to wise he picks up on it I think in that way real quick and you know he's a fun you not explain things really well to him because you have 40 years of common language and experience to say hey remember when I do this or hey remember and football and that or hey remember when whatever you got all this stuff you can communicate through the tone Because if they want to be tactful they get to be tactful and say hey you know what I know was a tough project and you pulled it off which was commendable but there was some definite errors for improvement and you know what luckily I kept a list. and we're like those aren't even like applicable excuses you know So I'm I think I'm going to call this guy and this guy he's talking about is the old school expert who, you know, like he doesn't do it anymore. yeah don't do that beyond selfish and the other thing is when you do on selfish things like the people notice it and if you're doing them because hey if they also notice this if you're doing something on selfish because you want credit for it that doesn't work either We learned lessons after we wrote extreme ownership and said, you know, what the most, you know, with the hardest thing for people to do is balance the dichotomy of leadership. Greg I think for whatever Greg Trin and we're basically conce like telling my brother hey like come back to duty he's been out of the game for a while Oh, yeah, I mean, because especially when those are, and I'm not going to go in that direction, obviously, because we're talking about something else, but especially if, sounds like you're about to go inside or I'm a little bit said you are. You're not that is, it's not like, it's not like I'm saying, hey, make this video and here's the effect that we want. and I was wearing jeans all my friends were not wearing jeans there were there so I was like it's like kind of go right I don't know where you said it exactly but how you were like hey if I'm a leader and my guy in the school is both ways by the way. And Jenna comes in, you know, actually I told Lave, I told a bunch of people, but you know, don't want to really want to give me any.
