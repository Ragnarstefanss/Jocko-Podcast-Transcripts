00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 18, with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Good evening, echo. Good evening. He who fights with monsters should be careful,

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.000
less he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss,

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we'll also gaze into thee. So said Nietzsche. And that is really what we're dealing with here in the world.

5
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In my world, fighting. Fighting against monsters. And I'm talking about what goes on not only

6
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the outside world and the evil that's there, but also in the world around us and also inside your head,

7
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
inside my head, there's battles, battles that can be raging every minute of the day,

8
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
between strength and weakness, between the past and the future, between good and evil,

9
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
between light and dark, opposing forces battling against each other.

10
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And we all see evil. I mean, of course, there's those of us that have been to war,

11
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
where we see concentrated evil, but evil's everywhere around us, around everyone, disease and crime and

12
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:14.000
murder and abuse and loss. And there's predators out there. And there's prey in nature and in humans.

13
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And as I've said before, there's parts of the world where we've built a nice bubble,

14
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
where we can all but remove the evil, or at least distance ourselves from it.

15
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And in doing so, we can almost, almost forget about it, almost.

16
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But it's a thin, thin veneer, and it doesn't take much to release the demons.

17
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It doesn't take much for humanity to fall apart. And that shows itself often in war,

18
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which is one of those things that can very quickly release the demons.

19
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There are dead soldiers, dead women, dead children. Everyone's dead.

20
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Sure, and headed boys, sometimes morose, sometimes laughing, beaten up in our barracks with broken jaws and ruptured lungs.

21
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
We were herded into this war and killed by the hundred.

22
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We didn't even know how to shoot. We couldn't kill anyone. We didn't know how.

23
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
All that we were capable of was crying and dying. And die we did.

24
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We called the rebels uncle, and when our boys' throats were cut, they'd beg the rebels, please uncle, don't kill me.

25
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
What did I ever do to you?

26
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We so wanted to live. Get that into your heads. You fat smug generals who sent us off to this slaughter.

27
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We hadn't yet seen life or even tasted it's scent, but we had already seen death.

28
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We knew this smell of congealed blood and the floor of a helicopter and a hundred degree heat.

29
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:38.000
New that the flesh of a torn-off leg turns black, and that a person can burn up entirely in lit gasoline, leaving just the bones.

30
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We knew that bodies swell up in the heat, and we listened to every night to the crazed dogs, howling in the ruins.

31
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Then we started to howl ourselves because to die at the age of 18 is terrifying.

32
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We were betrayed by everyone, and we died in a manner befitting real cannon fodder, silently and unfairly.

33
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000
By night they kick the living crap out of us, by day we unload corpses.

34
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I have no dreams in this tent, and no charred bodies chase me at night.

35
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I just plunged into a dark pit, where there is nothing, not even war, and I open my eyes when it gets light.

36
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
A person changes very quickly in war. He may be scared by a dead body on the first day, but a week later,

37
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:53.000
he can be eating from a can while leaning on human remains to be more comfortable.

38
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
That's a book we're diving into right now. It's called the One Soldier's War.

39
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:12.000
By Arcadey Bob Chanko, he was a Russian soldier, fought in both wars in Cheshnean, the first and the second.

40
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The Russians fought against the Cheshne rebels.

41
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is actually a book that a bunch of people, after we did a short piece and talked about the war in Cheshnean, and the lessons learned from that war.

42
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
A bunch of people hit me on Twitter and said to check out this book and I did, and they were right.

43
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It's a great narrative, and it shows you the impact of this war on the soldiers that fought in it.

44
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Again, we are going to see the veil of humanity ripped off.

45
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I think it's important first to kind of look at where these soldiers came from.

46
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Back to the book here, you won't find any smart handsome boys in these tents.

47
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They were gotten out of the war by the rich daddies, leaving it to us ordinary folk to die in Grosny.

48
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
The ones who didn't have the money to pay are way out.

49
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Heaped in these tents are the sons of laborers, teachers, peasants, and blue collar workers.

50
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Basically, all of those who were made penniless by the government's thieves, heaving reforms, and then left to waste away.

51
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000
These tents contain the ones who didn't know how to give a bribe to the right person, who thought that the army service was the duty of every man.

52
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Truth and nobility of hearts are no longer virtues in our world.

53
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Those who believe in them are the first to die.

54
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Now, one thing that I'm about to get into is the treatment of the Russian soldiers, which is absolutely just gangster.

55
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It's just gangster as the only way I can describe it.

56
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The way that the soldiers were treated, the way that the military was run, was just by brute force within the own chain of command.

57
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So there was no escape.

58
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is what they were dealing with.

59
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So there's an unofficial set of rules, a kind of a code of laws, which evaluated in Cour-Corpel punishment.

60
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
If I stuck my hands in my pockets, I'd get a thumb on the head.

61
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
That is the privilege of the older soldiers.

62
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
A spirit in a spirit is what they call the new soldiers. They call them spirits.

63
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
A spirit should forget about his pockets entirely.

64
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Otherwise, they will fill them up with sand and sow them.

65
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The sand chafes the groin in two days later, you have weeping sores.

66
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You can get a beating for anything at all.

67
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
If a spirit doesn't show respect in his conversation with an older soldier, a grandad, he'll get beaten up.

68
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
If he talks too loudly or goes about the barracks clattering his heels, he'll get beaten up.

69
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
If he lies on his bed in the day, he'll get beaten up.

70
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000
If people back home, send him good rubber slippers and he decides to wear them to the shower, he'll get beaten up and lose those slippers.

71
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
If a spirit even thinks of turning down the tops of his boots or walking around with his top button,

72
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
undonner if his cap is tipped back or on his head or one side, or he doesn't do his belt up tightly enough,

73
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
they'll thrash him so hard, he'll forget his name. He is a spirit, the lowest dregs,

74
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and it is his job to slave until the older soldiers have been discharged.

75
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then he goes on, that's sort of the basic military situation that they're in, and that he's raised in.

76
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And that sort of the garrison, meaning not the combat situation, but it's the garrison, the standard Russian situation if you're a soldier.

77
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Now, here's the situation he's in.

78
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.000
But there is none of this in our regimen. All of that stuff is just child's play. It's the big leagues here.

79
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I can walk how I like and where what I like and it doesn't bother anyone. They beat us for completely different reasons.

80
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Our older conscripts have already killed people and buried their comrades, and they don't believe they'll survive this war themselves.

81
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So beatings here are just the norm. Everyone is going to die anyway, both those doing the beating and their victims.

82
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So what's the big deal? There's the runway, two steps from here, and they keep bringing back bodies by the dozen.

83
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We'll all die here. Everybody beats everyone.

84
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000
The dmbs, with three months of service to go, the officers, the war officers, they get stinking drunk and then hammer the ones below them.

85
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Even the kernels beat the majors, the majors beat the lutenants, and they all beat the privates.

86
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And the granddad's beat the new recruits.

87
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
No one talks to each other like human beings. They just smack each other in the mouth because it's easier that way.

88
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Quicker and simpler to understand.

89
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Because you're all going to bite it anyway so you bitch is because there are unfed children back home,

90
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
because the officer corps is adored with impoverishment and hopelessness. Because a dml has three months left.

91
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Because every second man is shell-shocked because our mother-in-law makes us kill our own people, our own people who speak Russian.

92
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And we have to shoot them in the head and send their brains flying up walls, crush them with tanks and tear them to pieces.

93
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Because these people want to kill you because your soldiers arrived yesterday straight from training,

94
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and today they are already lying open on the air strip as lumped lumps of charred flesh and flies lay eggs in their open eyes.

95
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And because in a day the company is reduced to less than a third and God willing you'll stay among that third.

96
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Because the one thing that everyone knows is how to get drunk and kill, kill and kill some more.

97
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Because a soldier is a stinking wretch and a spirit doesn't have any right to live at all, and to beat him is actually to do him a favor.

98
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I'll teach you what war is about you, Prix.

99
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You can have a smack in a mouth so you don't think life is too rosy and thank your mother that she didn't have you six months earlier, or you'd all be dead now.

100
00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Everyone hates everyone else in this regimen. The hatred and madness hang over the square like a flower black cloud.

101
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And this cloud saturates young boys with fear, just like pieces of barbecue meat being marinated in lemon juice.

102
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Only they get stewed and fear and hatred before they get sent off to the meat grinder.

103
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It will be easy, it will be easier for us to die there.

104
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So you've got some, you know, the things with the things you hear me talking about all the time, the camaraderie, the the spree, decor, the brotherhood, all of it's just gone.

105
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Now you're going to get to a point and he does get to it where you get to the front line troopers when they're fighting and they rely on each other and they have the normal soldierly brotherly comrade love for each other.

106
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But as a unit throughout the ranks, you can see it's it's it's awful.

107
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And this is before we even get to the fighting.

108
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Yeah, cove love vanished toward evening.

109
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He wasn't the first to go missing.

110
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.000
A couple of weeks earlier, two soldiers from the 8th company had taken a machine gun and tried to go home.

111
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
No one looked for your cove love.

112
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The storming of grass and he was underway and second battalion tried in vain for the third day to take the cross shaped hospital, suffering high casualties.

113
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And we were bogged down for the third day at the first row of houses in the private district.

114
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The storming operation was faltering and we didn't have time to look.

115
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They listed him as a deserter, road office rifle, as lost in combat and closed the case.

116
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It was the Oman and this is like there are sort of a special police unit that they had within the military.

117
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Oman, it was the Oman who turned up our missing man during the night while they were mopping up in the first line.

118
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
In one cottage cellar, they found a mutilated body.

119
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
The rebels had slid him open like a tin of meat.

120
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Pulled out his intestines and used them to strangle him while he was still alive.

121
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:40.000
On the neatly white washed walls above him, written in his blood where the words, alachbar, God is great.

122
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So now you get a little bit from the enemy and we already talked about the abuse and now we're going to get into some blue on blue.

123
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Some fractures side.

124
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Half an hour later we got sheld by self-propelled guns.

125
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I'm standing in the street with a company commander when the first house on the right suddenly shutters and start to collapse in the center.

126
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
A huge split spreads down from the ninth floor.

127
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Balcanese girders and floor supports spew out and seemed to hover in the air, turn over and then drive themselves into ground with a thud.

128
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Small debris scatters into the yard after the heavy blocks.

129
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000
We don't know what's happening and squat down instinctively, crawl behind a rusty, shrapnel-riddled garage and look all around us.

130
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Then we realize that it's friendly fire.

131
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
The company commander fumbles for the headphone of the radio on my back and starts to call the Battalion commander.

132
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I crawl over to the spare radio that's standing on open ground with the commander scrambling after me, still wearing the headphones.

133
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
One after the other, him standing over my head and me crouch between his legs, we shout into the mouthpiece for them to cease firing.

134
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Tangled up in the wires and the headphones, we forget all about the shrapnel.

135
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
All we can think about is reporting that we are here and they should hold chilling.

136
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
That we must stop them from hitting our guys.

137
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Our infantrymen pour out of the house and stand dumbstruck on the porch is not knowing where to run.

138
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Huge 150 millimeter shells weighing more than 60 pounds wore through the air.

139
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Above us and blow up the upper floors, one blast erupts a whole vertical section of the building vanishes, leaving just rusty steel entrails,

140
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Judging from the shattered walls.

141
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Another shell flies down the middle of the yard and hits the house on the left before it explodes.

142
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Time loses meaning. We lie behind the garage, pressing ourselves into the snow.

143
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
How long this lasts, I have no idea.

144
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Finally, it's over.

145
00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000
With two seriously wounded, the shell that flew down the middle of the yard exploded right inside their headquarters while two men were there.

146
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
The leg and one side of them was blown to pieces and the other had both legs torn off.

147
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Again, we run the wounded to the carrier on stretchers and load them inside.

148
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Again, they make no sound except for when one opens his eyes and says quietly, get my leg.

149
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Side G picks up the severed remnants of the leg and carries it up along beside the stretcher, five of them carry him in pieces, foretaking his torso and one his leg.

150
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
They load him into the carrier, the limb is placed inside behind him.

151
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
The other wounded man dies.

152
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Some insight here. I think this is striking.

153
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I remember when you're a kid, you grow up, you watch war movies, you watch war documentaries, you watch a world war two films and they're all black and white.

154
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Sometimes people think that war is black and white, because that's what you see.

155
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And he thought the same thing, and here he is, I always used to think that war was black and white, but it's in color.

156
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
It's not true what the song says, that birds don't sing and trees don't grow in war.

157
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:30.000
In fact, people get killed in the midst of such vivid color, among the green foliage of the trees under the clear blue sky.

158
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And life homes on all around, the birds brim with song, the grass blooms with brightly colored flowers, dead people lie in the grass, and they are not a bit scary in appearance as part of this multi-colored world.

159
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You can laugh and chat alongside them, humanity doesn't freeze and go crazy at the sight of a body.

160
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
It's only frightening when people shoot at you.

161
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And it's very frightening that war is in color.

162
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Talking about some of the civilians, especially the mothers.

163
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
The mothers have it worst of all in this war.

164
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
They don't belong to either side.

165
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
They get brushed off from the Russian generals or our soldiers shoot at them.

166
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And as one priest, we freed from captivity told me, the cheshens take them off into the mountains and rape them, kill them, and feed their innards to their dogs.

167
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
They've been betrayed by everyone, these Russian women.

168
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
They die by the dozen.

169
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Yet still, they wander around Cheshania with their photos searching for their sons.

170
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And what's happening to the sons?

171
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Here's what's happening to the sons.

172
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Then the cheshens start killing our guys they took prisoner.

173
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:13.000
They shout from the end of the street to get our attention and show a few soldiers, badly beaten, and with their hands tied behind their backs.

174
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
The cheshens laugh and shout something at us in their language, and then quickly put one of the prisoners on his side on the asphalt.

175
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Pin his head with a foot and stab and twice in the throat with a knife.

176
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000
The boy jerks his tied hands and wimpers, and a black trickle spreads from his slash throat onto the road.

177
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
The cheshens go back around the corner, leaving him to die on the asphalt.

178
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
He lies a long time on his side without moving, and then he starts to twitch.

179
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
He jerks his bound hands and tries to turn over as if he's uncomfortable.

180
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Then he falls quite again.

181
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:08.000
It is painful for him to move, and he obediently lies on his side with a gaping throat that keeps pumping a black trickle.

182
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000
When we think he's already dead, he starts to twitch again and tries to crawl, then goes still again.

183
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
This goes on a long time, blood pours from his throat, and smears across his face.

184
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000
His jacket is slipped down to his elbows, and when he jerks his arms, blood spurts from an artery onto his bear shoulder.

185
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Bastards says, murky, unable to bear any longer, he jumps up and shouts over the buildings, just kill him, you fuckers, shoot him, you bastards, bastards.

186
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
He unslings his rifle, but Osepaul then loop managed to grab the barrel.

187
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
They grip his arms and press him to the ground.

188
00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Murky squats, holding his head in his hands and moaning, bastards, bastards, bastards he whimpered whispers.

189
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000
The boy soon starts to choke, he can't breathe and blood sprays from his mouth as he coughs.

190
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Sometimes he loses consciousness for a while and lies motionless, then he comes to and once again tries to crawl.

191
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
When he stops moving all together, the chush and shoot him in the back with tracer rounds.

192
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
The bullets pass through his body and ricochet into the sky.

193
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
They also killed a rest of the prisoners.

194
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
This time they don't appear from around the corner, all we hear are screams.

195
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Before they cut each boy's throat, they shout, alok bar.

196
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:54.000
We hear this several times and an hour later, they throw the bodies out into the street.

197
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Savodry.

198
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And unfortunately, savodry breeds more savodry than the downward spiral of sadism.

199
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
And in humanity.

200
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Meanwhile, stories of horrors elsewhere in Cheshnie are kept filtering back to us.

201
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
A friend of mine told me how his battalion entered some village or another.

202
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:42.000
It didn't get sheldt much and was almost intact, but around the main square, where large crosses upon which Russian soldiers had been crucified.

203
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000
They'd been nailed up by their hands and each had a few bullet holes in his chest.

204
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
They had all been castrated.

205
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
The commander ordered them to do a sweep through the village.

206
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
All the men who could be found were heard it up into the square.

207
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
They were thrown down in piles and our soldiers started to hack them up.

208
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:19.000
One guy pinned a chest into the ground with his foot, while another pulled off his pants, and with two or three hefty slashes severed his scrotum.

209
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
The serrated blade of the knife snagged the skin and pulled the blood vessels from his body.

210
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
In half a day, the whole village was castrated.

211
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Then the battalion moved out. Our dead men remained on the crosses.

212
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:54.000
As I said, savagery breeds more savagery.

213
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Here's one of the worst parts. I think this is one of the worst parts psychologically for this soldier, for our Katie, and many of the soldiers that were fighting alongside him.

214
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
We don't know what we are fighting for.

215
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
We have no goal, no morals, or internal justification for what we do.

216
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
We are sent off to kill and to meet our deaths, but we don't know why.

217
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
We just drew the short straw, happened to be born 18 years ago, and grew up just in time for this war.

218
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And our blame ends there.

219
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:55.000
The only thing we have is hope that we will survive and preserve our sense of self and be able to remain human beings.

220
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
We all feel the adjusted of it all.

221
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
We feel the injustice of it all so acutely with our 18 years.

222
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Each one of us that survives this war will truly believe that such evil should never happen again.

223
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Every shell that hit us tore apart both the flesh and the soul.

224
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Our whole outlook on life crumbled in collapse beneath this demonic fire, and there was nothing to fill the emptiness in it.

225
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
The only thing we have left is ourselves and our brothers and arms.

226
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
All we know of life is death.

227
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000
If anyone ever asks me what were you fighting for, I will reply for those who clung to the ground next to me.

228
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
We fought only for each other.

229
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Our entire generation may have died in Cheshnia, a whole generation of Russians.

230
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Even those of us who stayed alive, can they really be those same 18 year old laughing boys who once got seen off to the army by their loved ones?

231
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
No.

232
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
We died.

233
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
We all died in that war.

234
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Now, there's a point where our K to the author, he's there under fire.

235
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Obviously, he's feeling the pressure of being under fire, and there's a sniper.

236
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
He thinks he knows where the sniper is, but he's not 100% sure.

237
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
He just kind of thinks, hey, I think I saw something and he calls for fire.

238
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
The words he directs, heavy cannons from some armored vehicles towards that fire.

239
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:15.000
And the next day or two days later, he finds out that what happened to the people that were killed in that was like an eight year old or a nine year old girl, and her grandfather.

240
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And so here's his thoughts on that.

241
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Yesterday, I murdered a girl.

242
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I suddenly felt sick, and there was nothing I could do about it.

243
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
There was nowhere to go and beg forgiveness.

244
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
I had murdered them, and it was irrevocable.

245
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Now I would be a child killer my whole life, and I'd have to live with this.

246
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Eat drink, raise children, be happy, and sad, laugh, and cry, be ill, love, and kiss Olga.

247
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Touch this pure radiant creation with hands that had murdered.

248
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Touch her face, eyes, lips, breasts so tender and vulnerable, and leave greasy traces of death on her clear skin.

249
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
These hands, these damned hands, I should cut them off and discard them.

250
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I will never get them clean now.

251
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
I stuck my hands between my knees and started to rub them on my pant legs.

252
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
I understood that this was psychosis, madness, but I couldn't help it.

253
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000
It seemed to my hands had become sticky, like when you've eaten food in a dirty cafe under the sun.

254
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Murder had stuck to them, the violest kind of murder, and I couldn't get it off.

255
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:58.000
The next day he's in the chow hall, they're eating, and one of his buddies hands him attend with some oatmeal in it.

256
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Here, eat this, we saved it for you.

257
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Thanks, I took the tin and absolutely started to wolf down the cold oatmeal.

258
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Then I stopped.

259
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Remember how the cheshians hit us yesterday?

260
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
You know what? It turns out we killed a girl when we fired back, an eight-year-old girl and her grandfather.

261
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And here's the response from Olga.

262
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
It happens.

263
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Don't think about it, it'll pass.

264
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
If you're going to put yourself through hell every time it happens, you'll go out of your mind.

265
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
People hear kill and get killed.

266
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
They kill us, we kill them.

267
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I've killed too.

268
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
It's just war.

269
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Our own lives aren't worth a thing here, let alone someone else's.

270
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Don't think about it, at least not until you get home.

271
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Right now you're still too close to her.

272
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
She's dead and you're alive, but you're both still rotting in one place.

273
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Only she's below ground and you're above it.

274
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And the difference between you may only be one day.

275
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Now going to another little section where they've gone into a place called Argonne.

276
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And they've got a pretty secure perimeter in an old factory.

277
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
We are halted for the fourth day in a row at the Canning Factory in Argonne.

278
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000
It's the best place we've been so far during our deployment and we feel completely safe inside the fence that skirts the perimeter.

279
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:43.000
The trouble with this war is that we are in a permanent state of encirclement and can expect to be shot in the back at any moment.

280
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
But here we are sheltered.

281
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
We relax.

282
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
April has arrived in the sun has already beating down.

283
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
We rock around practically naked, wearing only our cut-off long johns and army boots.

284
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
And we are alike as brothers.

285
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And brothers we are.

286
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
For there's no one in the world closer than emaciated soldiers with light-bitten arm pits, sun brown necks,

287
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
and otherwise white-butrefined skin.

288
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
While he's there he's reflecting on some of the things he's seen.

289
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
And he says, I remember the photo we found near Shatoy of the little Cheshien boy.

290
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000
He's only about seven, but he's showing off with a rifle in his hands while his mom stands alongside,

291
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
beaming her little grown-up son.

292
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000
How proud she is of him, so full of joy for the holy warrior who already knows how to hold the rifle.

293
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000
There will be even greater pride in her eyes when he severs the head of his first Russian prisoner at the age of 17.

294
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000
At 20 he'll attack a column and kill more people, and at 22 he'll run his own slave camp.

295
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Then at 25 they will hunt him down from a helicopter like a wolf.

296
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Flush him into the open and fire rockets at him as he darts between shell craters splattering his guts all over the place.

297
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Then he'll lie in a puddle and stare at the sky with half open lifeless eyes,

298
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:29.000
now nothing more than an object of disgust as the ice crawlin to his beard.

299
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
We've seen warriors like this grown up from such boys, from cubs into wolves.

300
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:44.000
And to think my mother would have flayed the skin from my back with a belt if I'd ever thought to pose with a weapon when I was a kid.

301
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Enough.

302
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
No sense in dwelling on this now.

303
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Later.

304
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Everything later.

305
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So we kind of talked about the suffering that they abuse that they're taking from their own military leadership.

306
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
We talked about the friendly fire situation, the hard and enemy that gets raised to fight.

307
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000
And on top of all that there's nature and disease that they have to deal with.

308
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
My bleeding starts again and my long johns are permanently encrusted with blood.

309
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
We all have it.

310
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Your rectum swells up and protrudes out several centimeters.

311
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Half your backside hangs out and you sit resplendent like a scarlet flower.

312
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Where are we where are we supposed to find wiping material?

313
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.000
We strip the remaining scraps of wallpaper from the store rooms and rasp at our poor back sides,

314
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
inflicting further harm on ourselves and sending blood gushing from our pants.

315
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
War is not just attacks, trenches, firefights and grenades.

316
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
It's also blood and feces running down your rotting legs.

317
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
It's starvation, lice and drunken madness.

318
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
It's swearing and human debasement.

319
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000
It's an inhuman stench and clouds of flies circling over our battalion.

320
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And as time goes on, he's sort of starting to feel like the end of the war,

321
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000
and he's going to come which starts to actually intensify the fear for him.

322
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
I live with fear constantly now.

323
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
He began that day and doesn't abate.

324
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I'm scared all the time.

325
00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:02.000
The fear alternately turns slowly like a worm somewhere below my stomach or floods through me with a hot flush of sweat.

326
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
This is not the tension I experienced in the mountains, but pure animal fear.

327
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I can no longer sleep.

328
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I don't trust the centuries and spend most nights in the admin building or on the parade ground.

329
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
I always keep my chest harness stuffed with loaded magazines that I've traded for food and cigarettes.

330
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000
I have about 25 magazines and still seems too few.

331
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I also empty a few clips of bullets into my pockets and hang about a dozen grenades from my belt.

332
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It's still not enough.

333
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
If they storm us, I want to be fully armed.

334
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And that's how he kind of finishes out in that complete state of fear.

335
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And then it's over.

336
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
The battalion leaves for where we are to be discharged for us the war is over.

337
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
It starts to rain.

338
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000
The tires of the vehicles squeal on the wet asphalt and rainbow is glimmer in the spray thrown up by the wheels.

339
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I open the hatch and stick my face out under the rain. Large drops fall straight and evenly on my skin.

340
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000
The sun hangs heavily on the horizon and our column casts long shadows in its rays.

341
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And that's it.

342
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Peace.

343
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000
This warm damp day is the last day of our war.

344
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
The ship is dead and so many others.

345
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
I remember all of my comrades.

346
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
I remember their faces, their names.

347
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
At last we have peace boys.

348
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
We waited so long for it, didn't we?

349
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:07.000
We so wanted to meet it together to go home and not part company until the whole platoon had been to everyone else's home.

350
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And even after that we would stay together, stay together, live as one community always close, always there for each other.

351
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
What will I do without you?

352
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.000
You are my brothers, given to me by the war and we shouldn't be separated.

353
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
We'll always be together.

354
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
We still have our whole lives ahead of us.

355
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Now, as we hear a lot about these days, the war ended, but it wasn't over.

356
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
It wasn't over for these guys.

357
00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And at this point, our Katie is now back in the city.

358
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And he's talking, he's walking around and he's dealing with people.

359
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:17.000
And you're going to see here, he meets up with some other veterans, wounded veterans that are basically on the street.

360
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000
About a million military personnel passed through Cheshnean the 10 years after the start of the first war in 1994.

361
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
That's the population of a large city.

362
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Fifty divisions of seasoned soldiers who bring their philosophy, the philosophy of war back to civilian life with them when they return.

363
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:50.000
At the age of 18, they had already killed men who were sometimes older than their fathers and saw how these grown men died from the bullets unleashed by their hands.

364
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
There were no voices of authority and there was no God either.

365
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
They were ready for anything.

366
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
There were no women in their world, no children, no old men, no sick people, no cripples.

367
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000
There were just goals, dangerous ones, safe ones, and ones with potential.

368
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Three of them, meaning three of the veterans, three of them meet and sit in the subway near my metro station every morning.

369
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
They have five medals between them.

370
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Six crutches, two artificial limbs, and one leg, and a common hatred for the whole world.

371
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:42.000
They've been coming here for a few years now to sing songs, and they are always the same songs in the same order.

372
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
They sing terribly, but that doesn't bother them.

373
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
They hate the people they are singing for.

374
00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:00.000
They see the world from below, and not just because they only have half their bodies left, but because half of their souls are gone too.

375
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
They're closer to the spit-drenched asphalt than the people's faces.

376
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.000
They no longer have the strength to get up and start a new life on plastic legs and no longer wish to.

377
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
These young men don't want to try to keep up with life anymore.

378
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000
All they want is for the war to last forever, and for them to be a part of it.

379
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.000
For furnishings, one of them brought a small travel rug, a small kitchen cushion to sit on, and to take player.

380
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
When two of his comrades leave, he stays there on his own.

381
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
I don't know his name, and it doesn't matter. He is my brother. They all are.

382
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Others given to me by the war. The whole of Moscow is filled with such brothers.

383
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
There's at least one in each subway. He spoke first.

384
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Where did you fight then, brother? I told him. Then he started to remember stuff.

385
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Where, when, how, he told me about getting his leg torn off when his carrier got ambushed.

386
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000
A shell hit the armor by his right hip. He didn't lose consciousness, and he even saw his ripped off leg jerking,

387
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.000
and the boots scraping on the rivets. I didn't ask him anything. Just listened in silence.

388
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
And he calmly spoke, and without any hysterics, just discussing life.

389
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
I don't understand this world. These people. Why are they alive? What for?

390
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
They were given life at birth and didn't have to pry it away from death. Have a good life, people.

391
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
But how do they spend it? Do they want to invent a cure for AIDS and build the world's most beautiful bridge,

392
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
or make everyone happy? No. They want to rip everyone off.

393
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Stash away as much money as they can, and that's it. So many boys died. Real kids.

394
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And these people hear Fridder their lives away as ignorally as a kitten playing with a ball,

395
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000
and have no idea why they are alive. Pointless people. A whole world full of pointless people.

396
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
A lost generation. And it's not we who are the lost generation.

397
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
It's them. Those who didn't fight. They are.

398
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:35.000
If their deaths could bring back just one of those boys, then I'd kill all of them without hesitation.

399
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Every single one of them is my personal enemy.

400
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000
He lights a new cigarette from the stub of his last and pours a fresh shot of vodka.

401
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
And then he laughs evenly, and his eyes flash with hatred.

402
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.000
You can't go on enjoying yourself while two hours flight away. People are killing each other.

403
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Children are still dying, and there's starvation, and yet those people are willing to pay 700 rubles for a theater ticket.

404
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
That's 2000 for the family, just to amuse themselves. You can live for two months and chestening on that money.

405
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000
I must be concussed because I don't understand this. I just can't get my head around it.

406
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
There's a war going on in their country, and they don't give a damn.

407
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
So in that case, why shouldn't give a damn about them, either?

408
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Not one of them should ever die without knowing what war is.

409
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I want for them to to cry out at night, and cry in their sleep, and without waking to dive under the bed

410
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.000
when the New Year's Eve's fireworks are exploding in the yard, and wine there from terror like we did.

411
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
There's guilty of our deaths as those who killed us, who sent us to the slaughter.

412
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Why weren't they striking in Moscow and blocking the roads when we were being killed in Grosni? Why?

413
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Why weren't they screaming and tearing their hair out when they saw on TV how dogs fed off the flesh of their boys?

414
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Why was there no revolution uprising or civil unrest?

415
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
How could they send their sons off to this slaughter?

416
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000
And then go and have fun live, drink beer and earn money while they were dying down there.

417
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000
While jets were flattening the mountains and tearing apart children and women when wounded, chest and kids, rotted in sellers,

418
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000
wrapping the stumps of their limbs in rags and infection crept across the wounds.

419
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
There are also guilty of these deaths.

420
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:54.000
We are here to get what's ours and we are ready to kill.

421
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
His hatred abates as suddenly as it had welled over.

422
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000
His eyes recede once again behind a film of indifference.

423
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Half truths everywhere, half sincerity, half friendship.

424
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I can't accept that.

425
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Here in civilian life, they only have half truths.

426
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
The small measure of truth we had in war was a big lie.

427
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
So many boys died and eyes survived.

428
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
The whole time I used to wonder what for?

429
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
They were better than I was.

430
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000
But I survived. Surely this is not by pure chance.

431
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Maybe I lived so that others remember us.

432
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I am a reminder. He says,

433
00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:04.000
It's obviously a...

434
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
You know, this is this is psychological damage.

435
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And this is someone that is still reeling from the war.

436
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And I can tell you, when I came home from my last appointment,

437
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I didn't feel like that.

438
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
But I understand what he's talking about when I came home from my last appointment

439
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
and knowing what great sacrifices Americans were making overseason,

440
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
including my friends.

441
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.000
I remember walking around town and just looking at people.

442
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
It is difficult to make that transition mentally back to where people care about the stupidest things.

443
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.000
And they're complaining about things that are just no human being should ever be given the right to complain about.

444
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
And as that individual right there was saying,

445
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
kind of what I say, what are you doing with your life?

446
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
What are you doing with your life?

447
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Because people have paid dearly to give you that freedom.

448
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
So what are you doing with it?

449
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
And now we get the author's view.

450
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And you can kind of hear his struggle as well.

451
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000
No one returns from the war ever.

452
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Mother's get back a sad semblance of their sons.

453
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Embedded, aggressive beasts hardened against the whole world and believing in nothing except death.

454
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Yesterday soldiers are no longer belong to their parents.

455
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
They belong to war.

456
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
And only their body returns from the war.

457
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Their soul stays there.

458
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
But the body still comes home.

459
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
And the war within it dies gradually, shedding itself in layers, scale by scale.

460
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Slowly, very slowly, yesterday's soldier, sergeant, or captain transforms from a soulless dummy with empty eyes and a burned out soul into something like a human being.

461
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
The unbearable nervous tension adds away.

462
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
The aggression simmers down.

463
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
The hatred passes.

464
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
The loneliness abates.

465
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
It's the fear that lingers longest of all.

466
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
An animal fear of death.

467
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
But that too passes with time.

468
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
And you start to learn to live this life again.

469
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
You learn to walk without checking the ground beneath your feet for mines and trip wires and step on manholes on the road without fear.

470
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
And stand at your full height in the open ground.

471
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
And you go shopping, talk on the phone, and sleep on a bed.

472
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000
You learn to take for granted the hot water and the taps, the electricity, and the central heating.

473
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
You no longer jump at loud noises.

474
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
You start to live at first because that's how it's worked out.

475
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
And you've stayed alive.

476
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
You do it without gaining much joy from life.

477
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
You look at everything as a windfall that came your way through some whim of fate.

478
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
You live your life from cover to cover.

479
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
In those 180 days you were there.

480
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:59.000
And the remaining 50 odd years can't add anything to that time or detract from it.

481
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Then you start to get drawn into life.

482
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
You get interested in this game, which isn't for real.

483
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000
You pass yourself off as a fully fledged member of society.

484
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000
And the mask of a normal person grows onto you no longer rejected by your body.

485
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.000
And those around you think you are just the same as everyone else.

486
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
But no one knows your real face.

487
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
And no one knows that you are no longer a person.

488
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Happy laughing people walk around you, accepting you as one of their own.

489
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
And no one knows where you've been.

490
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
But that doesn't bother you anymore.

491
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
You now remember the war is some cartoon horror movie you once saw.

492
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
But you no longer recognize yourself as one of its characters.

493
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
You don't tell anyone the truth anymore.

494
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
You can't explain what war really is to someone who's never been there.

495
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Just as you can't explain green to a blind person.

496
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Or a man can't know what it's like to give birth.

497
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000
They simply don't have the necessary sensory organs.

498
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
You can't explain or understand war.

499
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
All you can do is experience it.

500
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
You're still waiting for something all these years.

501
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
God knows what though.

502
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
You simply can't believe that it ends just like that without any consequences.

503
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
You're probably waiting for someone to shed some light on it all.

504
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
For someone to come up to you and say,

505
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Brother, I know where you've been.

506
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
I know what war is.

507
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
And I know what you've been fighting for.

508
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
That's very important to know why and what for.

509
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Why the brothers the war gave to you had to die.

510
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Why people were killed.

511
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Why they were fired on.

512
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Goodwill, justice, faith and love.

513
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Crushed children and bombed women.

514
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Why the world need to lose that girl I saw on the runway with her smashed head.

515
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
And a bit of her brain lying in an ammo box next to her.

516
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Why?

517
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000
But no one tells you.

518
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
And then you yesterday's soldier, sergeant,

519
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
or captain start to explain it to yourself.

520
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000
You take a pen and paper and produce the first phrase as you start to write.

521
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
You still don't know what it'll be.

522
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Or short story or a poem or a song.

523
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
The lines come with difficulty.

524
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Each letter tearing your body like a shard being pulled from a wound.

525
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000
You feel this pain physically as the war comes out of you.

526
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
And on the paper shaking you so that you can't see the letters.

527
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
You are back there again and death wants more rules everything.

528
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
The room fills with mowning and fear.

529
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
And once again you hear the big guns, the screams of the wounded,

530
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
and people being burned alive.

531
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
And the whistle of mortar shells falling towards your prone back.

532
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
The dead rise from their graves and form up.

533
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000
A great number of them, everyone who is dear to you and was killed.

534
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
You can already spot that familiar faces.

535
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Igor, Vaseline, four eyes, the platoon commander.

536
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
They lean towards you and whisper.

537
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000
And their whispering fills the room.

538
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Go on, brother.

539
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Tell them how we burned in the carriers.

540
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Tell them how we cried in surrounded checkpoints in August of 1996.

541
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000
How we whimpered and begged them not to kill us as they pinned us to the ground with their feet and slid our

542
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
fruits.

543
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Tell them how boys bodies twitch when bullets hit them.

544
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
You survived only because we died there.

545
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Go on, they should know all this.

546
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
No one should die before they know what war is.

547
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
And tinge with blood.

548
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000
The written words appear one after the other.

549
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:20.000
vodka is downed by the pint while death and madness sit behind you, nudging you and correcting your pen.

550
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000
And there you are.

551
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Yesterday's soldier, sergeant, or captain,

552
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:36.000
concussed a hundred times, shot to pieces, patched up, reassembled half crazed and stupified.

553
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And you write and write and whine with helplessness and sorrow.

554
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:48.000
And tears poured out of your face and stick into your stubble.

555
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
And you realize.

556
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
That you should not have returned from the war.

557
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
And that is.

558
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Where the book closes.

559
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And those are the demons.

560
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Those are the demons.

561
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Why did I survive?

562
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Why not them?

563
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
What about the innocence we killed?

564
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Am I good for anything else besides war?

565
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:47.000
And it's not just war.

566
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
That brings out demons.

567
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Life does.

568
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Stress, and mayhem, and accidents, and crime,

569
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000
and madness, and loss.

570
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Those are demons.

571
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.000
That attack, that attack your soul.

572
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000
And there's a saying, and it's something like,

573
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:31.000
if I kill all my demons, then my angels, they die too.

574
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:38.000
And I say, no.

575
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
I say, do not kill your demons.

576
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Instead understand them.

577
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Know them.

578
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
It's one of the oldest tenants of war.

579
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:02.000
You have to know your enemy so you can defeat your enemy.

580
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
And the best trick the devil can play is to make you think he's not there.

581
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
And that's what these demons do.

582
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
They hide deep.

583
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
They pick away at you and they set up on you.

584
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000
But don't pretend that the demons aren't there.

585
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
You have to understand them.

586
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Bring them in.

587
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Hold them close.

588
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Hold them tight.

589
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
So you can control them.

590
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.000
So you can recognize their form and their presence and their actions.

591
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:57.000
And I read about those soldiers living in the streets barely living.

592
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Lost on alcohol and drugs.

593
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I think at least in my mind.

594
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
It's not because they surrendered to the demons.

595
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It's because they didn't see them.

596
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
They didn't know that they were there.

597
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
They didn't recognize them and they got ambushed.

598
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And in fighting.

599
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
You know, in fighting, it's the punch that you don't see that knocks you out.

600
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And in war, it's the ambush that you don't see that kills you.

601
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And in your mind, it's gotta be the thoughts that you don't see.

602
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
The things that you don't acknowledge that you try to ignore.

603
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The ones that you try and say aren't there that you don't admit to.

604
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Those are the ones that get you.

605
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Those are the ones that drag you down.

606
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Those are the ones that make you weaker that control you.

607
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:06.000
That pull you into a bottle of pills or a booze or into rage or depression.

608
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.000
When you see an alcoholic or a drug addict or someone that has some thing dragging them down.

609
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It's often because they failed to truly admit that that demon is there.

610
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And that demon has control over them.

611
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And they failed to recognize that they can control the demon.

612
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I say,

613
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Know your enemy.

614
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Know your demons.

615
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And that way you can control them and fight them and keep them at bay.

616
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And you don't need to kill them.

617
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
In fact, I don't even know if you can't kill them.

618
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
They're part of you.

619
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
They're part of what makes you, you, they're part of what makes me me.

620
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I don't want to kill them.

621
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Because if I killed my demons,

622
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
then maybe I kill my angels as well.

623
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
But you need to put them in their place.

624
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
You need to control them.

625
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Keep those demons in check.

626
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So they don't sneak up on you.

627
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And nash you.

628
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And end up controlling you.

629
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And there's one more piece to this.

630
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
The stronger that you get,

631
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
the weaker the demons get,

632
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
the more you control them,

633
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
the easier they are to control.

634
01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:05.000
It just takes that awareness and that ownership and that recognition and the mindset.

635
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So that you can live your life as you should in control.

636
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And on your terms,

637
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000
not on the terms of the demons in your head.

638
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So,

639
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
see them.

640
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And watch them and control them.

641
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Own them.

642
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And then live your life.

643
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Now, once again,

644
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
it appears that I've gone to that dark place.

645
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, who recommended that book, by the way?

646
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Do you remember?

647
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah, I'll have to figure it out.

648
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But I think part of that,

649
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and you and I were talking prior to this,

650
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and I had to tell you,

651
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
this is part of me.

652
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I've attempted to sit down a couple times with the big positive podcasts,

653
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
and I'm sure we will.

654
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But I got some demons in there too that are talking,

655
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and this is what they're drawn to,

656
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and I want to face them.

657
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I want to face them.

658
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I want to look at them.

659
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I want to go toe to toe with them.

660
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And another thing is,

661
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
as both those soldiers said,

662
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.000
people shouldn't get to live without knowing what war is like.

663
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Because until you know what war is like,

664
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
or at least until you open your mind to understand what it is,

665
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
where it comes from, what it does to people,

666
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
then that's a whole,

667
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
it's a whole part of humanity that you're not seeing.

668
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And it's the darkest part.

669
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And you've got to recognize that,

670
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
especially because if you don't recognize that that darkness is there,

671
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
again, you're not going to see the beauty you have in your own life,

672
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
and you know what?

673
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
That was dark, that was deep,

674
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
and you know what?

675
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
In the next 10 minutes,

676
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
you're not going to be laughing at something.

677
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We're going to be enjoying something,

678
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
we're going to have some fun,

679
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and I think in that respect, the podcast,

680
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
it reflects life.

681
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Because life has ups and downs,

682
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and it has misery,

683
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
and it has sadness,

684
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and it also has fun,

685
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
and it has laughter.

686
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And that's what reality is.

687
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And all those pieces,

688
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
for me,

689
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the struggle,

690
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
the struggle and the pain,

691
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
that is life.

692
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
That is the education,

693
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
that's the reward,

694
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
that experience that you get,

695
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
that's what makes you better.

696
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
And I think that's why we keep ending up here.

697
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But,

698
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
we don't dwell there.

699
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And I don't dwell there.

700
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And I don't think people should dwell there.

701
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
That's one of the best things about recognizing

702
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
when you've got these things in your head.

703
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
If you're trying to ignore them,

704
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
they stay there.

705
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
When you face them,

706
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
guess what?

707
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I can move on.

708
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And in 10 minutes,

709
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
you're not going to be laughing about something.

710
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I don't know what, yet.

711
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Probably at you.

712
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
There we go.

713
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
We're already there.

714
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
The demon for the night has been faced,

715
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
my friend.

716
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Looks like it.

717
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Yeah.

718
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
So now let's get to the good stuff,

719
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
to the light.

720
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
The internet stuff.

721
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
That's right.

722
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
The internet stuff.

723
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.000
That's right.

724
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
The interwebs.

725
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Speaking of interwebs,

726
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
we are, in fact, sponsored by Onit.

727
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But onit.com slash jockel.

728
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
To get your warrior bars.

729
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Also known as the anti-donate.

730
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Anti-donate.

731
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
All right.

732
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Yeah, the anti-donate.

733
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
You don't know.

734
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And don't get your warrior bar.

735
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
You're self-sombed.

736
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Good protein.

737
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Some good fat.

738
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Not much carbs.

739
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
You know what's funny?

740
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Well, you know what's funny?

741
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
If you're not,

742
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
if you're in the mood,

743
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
like, you know,

744
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
you get cravings for some sprinkles or something.

745
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I don't know.

746
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Something next.

747
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The warrior bar.

748
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Yeah.

749
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It'll, it'll, it'll save that.

750
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You know,

751
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

752
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

753
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Yeah.

754
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Yeah.

And by the way.

767
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
This book right here.

768
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
The book that I read tonight.

769
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I know it was a hardcore book.

770
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And it was real deep and dark.

771
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
And it's, it's tough read.

772
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Menally.

773
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But it's also great read.

774
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I forgot to say this.

775
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The book is called One Soldiers War.

776
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I said it, but I said it briefly.

777
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I'm saying it clearly now.

778
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
One Soldiers War by Arcadey Babchenko.

779
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It's a great book and go to Amazon and buy it because it's, it's just a fantastic book.

780
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And it'll open your eyes to a part of the world that most people try to ignore.

781
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Yeah.

782
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And I don't believe you should ignore it.

783
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
So check that out.

784
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And you can buy the best.

785
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You put the rest of the books on the.

786
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Yeah.

787
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I'm starting to put the red, the back.

788
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Oh, we're lagging.

789
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Be, you know, a little bit lagging.

790
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Okay.

791
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Okay.

792
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
That's my fault.

793
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So I didn't make it clear enough that, you know.

794
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That that was important.

795
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yeah.

796
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That's absolutely true.

797
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
It is kind of your fault.

798
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And this one will be up there.

799
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
That one is up there.

800
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Put it that way.

801
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
A new one.

802
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
We're about excellent to excellent.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And if you want to shop for any other stuff on Amazon, just click through that.

806
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Through our website, then you go and then we get a little piece of that, which is awesome.

807
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
It's a good way to support the website.

808
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
So we can buy camera equipment and so we can buy new knives to put on the desk.

809
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Actually, we have a very good supply of knives.

810
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Got a bunch of cold steel knives.

811
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
They sent out which are awesome.

812
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Yes.

813
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And then yeah, there it is.

814
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And if you want to further support the podcast, you can get some shirts.

815
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
If you like, if you think they're they're cool and you'd learn.

816
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
This is a plain equals freedom.

817
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Then a cold and a jockel's head on it says good backwards when you look at it.

818
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So this is good.

819
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So I was talking to a guy and was basically saying, hey, listen man, you know,

820
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
we were going back and forth.

821
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We were texting.

822
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And I forget what started it off, but it was something along the lines of, you know, you got to just put your ego and check here.

823
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And he said something like, you know, we all need to put our eyes on him.

824
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
No, he said, I got to put my ego and check.

825
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You go and check.

826
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I said, we all got to put our ego and check.

827
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I got to work on that too.

828
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Of course.

829
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
We always do.

830
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And he said, yeah, and I'm not the one that has a t-shirt with my face on it.

831
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And I said, yeah, you're also not the one that wrote a 300 page book about yourself.

832
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And who has a podcast that's named after that's just your name.

833
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So believe me, we all got to work on it.

834
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Well, that sure things different because I made the shirt.

835
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That was my job.

837
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I did put the shirt like that.

838
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And then the bumpers, the president, but if you haven't seen those.

839
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah, go make echo, man.

840
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Jocco 2016 bumper stickers.

841
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So yeah, I did it for the greater good.

842
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I guess that's, I guess that's cool.

843
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I wonder what kind of cars are those going to be on?

844
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Are they going to be on, you know, Volkswagen's?

845
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Are they going to be on Mercedes?

846
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So who's going to put those on?

847
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I'm going to see, I think we see Ford's and Chevy's.

848
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Maybe for the most part.

849
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yeah, oh, sure. Yeah.

850
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't know.

851
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Get some European vehicles in there too.

852
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
We'll see you pretty good.

853
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Nonetheless, if you want a bumper sticker on your car, whatever kind of car you got,

854
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
you can get those at joccostore.com as well.

855
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Yeah, sure. It's bumper stickers all this stuff if you want them.

856
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
All right, let's go.

857
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Cool.

858
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So, I'll just ask you a question.

859
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Jocco, as someone who's been getting after it for as long as for a long time and is

860
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
in create injuries along the way, I see that you're a fan of mobility

861
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
what.

862
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I've been into star at stuff for a while myself.

863
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Do you have any perspective on the difference that mobility and form can have on

864
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000
performance, not just on addressing or preventing injuries?

865
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Did you encounter any material like this on your younger days in your younger days as a seal?

866
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
At an age when a lot of younger guys will just slam through things.

867
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.000
As someone who's still very active in your 40s, I'm curious to hear what your thoughts are versus how

868
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
you're 20s selfless.

869
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Well, so the first part of the question about form and technique and mobility affecting

870
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
performance, absolutely.

871
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I mean, technique is king, right, in any sport and it's funny when you break into a new sport,

872
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
you realize how important technique is because you think I can do that and then you try it and go,

873
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
there's a lot of technique.

874
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Jiu Jitsu is a classic example, but any sport that you play that looks like it's not that hard.

875
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
You go ahead and try it.

876
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
You realize how much of us every sport is technique.

877
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
So, technique is absolutely important.

878
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Mobility is also important and being able to move well and move smoothly, you know,

879
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
there's that whole, I don't know if it's a trend going on right now,

880
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
but this idea of movement training, you know, it's the same thing, you know, how, how are you going to move?

881
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Well, how do you move your body well?

882
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
So mobility is absolutely going to make your better performer.

883
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Now, when I was younger,

884
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the, I mean, we just did not do this stuff.

885
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
It was just merciless, no stretching, bad diet,

886
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
no mobility, and when we were sore or whatever,

887
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
we just just were sore.

888
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I mean, that was it.

889
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And, and looking back, I wish we knew more of that stuff.

890
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
We just didn't know it at the time.

891
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Maybe people knew it.

892
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I didn't know it.

893
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
My buddies didn't know it.

894
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
We just did what we did.

895
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
We just worked out hard and just dealt with the pain.

896
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And when we were sore or had an injury,

897
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
we just sucked it up and just drove through it.

898
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And I'm sure that's not good.

899
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So I think there should definitely be a focus on this kind of stuff.

900
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And it, you know, I think with one of the things that's,

901
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I think, I like me, I need more focus on that,

902
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
because I don't do enough mobility work.

903
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I don't do enough stretching.

904
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Never mind, let's mobility is like a moderate of an stretching.

905
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Right?

906
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
That's actually, you know, Eddie Bravo,

907
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
who's in GJ2, if you don't know what that is,

908
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
GJ2, Blackbelt, really creative game.

909
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
But he won't give somebody their Blackbelt unless they can do the lotus sit.

910
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Which is crazy.

911
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I mean, I can't come close to doing a lotus sit,

912
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
which is when you put your feet on top of your thighs.

913
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And he's told, I've heard him talk a couple times about,

914
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
you know, guys that were completely inflexible, big football players.

915
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And then he's like, you know, you can't get your Blackbelt until you can do the lotus.

916
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And these dudes just put their mind to it and can do it.

917
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
So just like anything else, you need to set some goals.

918
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I don't think I'm quite willing to step out onto the,

919
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I'm going to do a lotus.

920
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
But who knows, maybe that's something you set in the sand

921
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
and make it happen.

922
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And I think though, I think things can all people can go too far with that stuff.

923
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And I've said this before, like some of that extreme yoga

924
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
where you're just tying yourself a knots and going beyond

925
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
what a human's supposed to be able to do.

926
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
That's not, I don't believe that's good for your

927
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
and I have a couple friends.

928
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I've one friend in particular that was a hard core yoga guy who's using the

929
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
seal team to go out.

930
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Hard core yoga guy.

931
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And he said, he said, he believed it caused a lot of problems

932
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
when he got older and his back and his spine and his neck and his joints.

933
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Because you develop laxity, you know, you've developed looseness.

934
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
You have a higher probability.

935
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So I think you should stretch and be capable of the full range of

936
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
motion of what a normal, well-oiled human should be able to do.

937
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I think once you start putting your arms, you know, backwards

938
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
upside down and behind in between your legs and then back up again,

939
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I think you're going to have issues with that.

940
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I also think I do get some mobility from the workouts that I do

941
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
from, I do deep squats, right?

942
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I go all the way down on squats, I do a lot of overhead squats.

943
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I do muscle ups, I do full range of motion, pull ups and dips on

944
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
getting that movement, doing surfing, jiu-jitsu.

945
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I mean, you're constantly, you got to stay, you got to keep moving.

946
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
You know, that's what I think you got to do.

947
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You got to keep moving, you got to move in ways that are varied

948
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and make you move in different directions running, swimming, surfing,

949
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
jiu-jitsu, all different kinds of work and I'm just getting after it,

950
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
basically.

951
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You know, and that's another thing that I did right down here is a note

952
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
is, man, when I was younger, we just didn't tap that often in the jiu-jitsu.

953
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And you know, everybody asks me, everybody that hits me up on Twitter

954
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and says, first day of jiu-jitsu class tomorrow, what's your advice?

955
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
My advice is tap early and tap often because your ego,

956
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
if you let your ego control the tapping mechanism, you're going to get hurt.

957
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
And it might not be instant.

958
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Like my neck is jacked up, I've had neck surgery.

959
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
That's from Dean Lister.

960
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
That's from being in a guillotine and not tapping and being in arm

961
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
jokes and not tapping, that's from 20 years of not tapping to that stuff.

962
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Because I can take a pretty good joke.

963
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So it's cool that you didn't tap and you got out.

964
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
But after 20 years, guess what, you got some neck damage, son.

965
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And it's not to get it originally and buds that I definitely

966
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
definitely buds had something to do with it too.

967
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
But just wear and tear, but the additional wear and tear from jiu-jitsu,

968
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
definitely, you know, I think had a little something to do with it,

969
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
which was all unnecessary.

970
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It was just, hey, I'm not going to tap to this joke.

971
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
It hurts my neck.

972
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I hear some noises in there, but I'm not tapping to it.

973
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Yeah.

974
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It's not smart.

975
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yes, especially those neck ones, because there is an element of pain tolerance

976
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
that can help you in the neck stuff.

977
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
But you get a arm bar as a new guy and then you're rolling with another guy

978
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
who's kind of new, but he might know how to do the arm bar.

979
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
He might be kind of spazzing going hard and unnecessarily.

980
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Because he doesn't know the control yet and if you don't tap really

981
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
that's when you're going to get jammed up.

982
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Tap really and tap off in people.

983
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Or if you start tapping right when you feel the pain that's wrong too,

984
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
because a lot of times guys will put you in it and it's kind of understood

985
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
that boom you're locked in.

986
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
You know, you're not going anywhere so they kind of expect to tap.

987
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
You don't tap.

988
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Like I might think, oh, I'm not doing it right.

989
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Or I'm not, he has more flexibility.

990
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
He has one fodder shunt.

991
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
He has one fodder shunt.

992
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I'm not doing it right.

993
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Yeah, right.

994
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
It's hard or exactly. It's especially best locked in.

995
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
So it's like, all right.

996
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And then boom, you're hurt.

997
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Not good.

998
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Rod deal.

999
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Not good.

1000
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
It's hard to select the ability though.

1001
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Flexibility though.

1002
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And Eddie Bravo actually said this in a way where you know,

1003
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
little kids like little babies two years old.

1004
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah, we'll put it around their heads no problem.

1005
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Yeah, but for the most part, but they're not going to do this weird

1006
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
yo, you know how like some guys are, they're like double jointed or something.

1007
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
They won't be able to do that kind of stuff.

1008
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
So put loosely these two year olds.

1009
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
They have full flexibility.

1010
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Right.

1011
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And you just lose it over time as you gain muscle.

1012
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
You gain rigidity as you're, you know, everything gets stronger and stuff.

1013
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And if you don't put your body through those motions, you just kind of lose it.

1014
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So let's say if you're in a stretching for that from the being in the genetics,

1015
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
we'll play a part in that, that, that, how stretchy you can be.

1016
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
But so in a way, you can get back there.

1017
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
You just kind of work on getting that.

1018
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1019
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
You just just, it's a more, it's just like anything I've got.

1020
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Yeah, but yeah, pushing too far seems kind of weird because like, yeah,

1021
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
let's say I don't know, you can stretch your shoulder way behind your back.

1022
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Way behind your back.

1023
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
You don't have any really real strength there.

1024
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
No.

1025
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
But meanwhile, it's still easy to be back there.

1026
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
You know, and, I don't know, it seems like your joints kind of get rigid for it to be stronger, right?

1027
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I agree.

1028
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So bone before?

1029
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Yeah.

1030
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I agree.

1031
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Next question.

1032
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:26.000
How do the seals deal with fatigue, soreness, and beat down, and the beat down of buds, and SQT, without getting injured?

1033
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Well, you just get used to it.

1034
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000
And again, you know, I say this all the time buds and the SQT, which is the kind of the initial training after you get done with buds,

1035
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
which is the basic underwater demolition.

1036
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I mean, that's a short part of your career. I mean, it's literally a fraction of your career. It means nothing.

1037
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But just like any working out, you get used to it.

1038
01:20:47.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And if it's like when you work out, when you, if you haven't worked out for a long time, or someone that someone that just starts working out from nowhere, never worked out before, they're going to be sore as hell when they first work out.

1039
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I just had this happen to me, because I got, I went on the road, I went on a road trip, multiple back to back road trips, and I went overseas, came back when I came back. I got sick.

1040
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
So I was for like three weeks. I hadn't squatted heavy.

1041
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
At all. I had no body. All I did was body weight squats, you know, pistols just lunges.

1042
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
That's how I worked my legs. There's just no way to do what you can do.

1043
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
You know, hotel room in some strange part of Europe.

1044
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And when I came back, I was all happy, and I got on that squat. Once I, then I was sick.

1045
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Then once I got done being sick, I finally felt good. I got back on that squat rack.

1046
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And man, my legs were destroyed.

1047
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:49.000
For four or five days, I'm talking, you know, having a hard time sitting down, having a hard time standing up. It was gnarly.

1048
01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But that's just because my body just, it just wasn't lost that element. So of course, if you just started working out in your walking around sore all the time, that's, that's because you got to get used to it.

1049
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And in Buds, you do get injured just because it's massively repetition.

1050
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You know, there was a guy that we had that was a trainer, an athletic trainer for professional sports team.

1051
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And when he was there, there's this great example. There's something called Patela for moral syndrome, which is when you're patela because of the way you're running.

1052
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
It rubs on your your femur and it becomes problematic.

1053
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And he said in like a whole season in the NFL, or he would see maybe one of those injuries.

1054
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Maybe two, and you know, he'd have to figure out what it is. And when he was working in Buds, he would literally see 30 of those a week.

1055
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
So you just get to see, I mean, there's more people. There's 10 times the people, but it still is massive amount of injuries.

1056
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
And it's the same thing in the seal teams and the seal teams.

1057
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.000
It's your shoulders, it's your backs, it's your knees, it's your ankles. You get abused.

1058
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And it's, it's, it's not the working out that doesn't to you.

1059
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It's not working out. It's carrying a guy on your shoulder over the rocky terrain out in the desert and tripping on ankle.

1060
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:22.000
That's what you get hurt. It's jumping over off of a wall and you land on a cinder block that breaks and you, you know, it's that's the kind of stuff.

1061
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
The working out doesn't really do it to you.

1062
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I actually, one of the things when when I was a tasking to commander, we were going through land warfare training.

1063
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And I would work out every day and I would roll with guys, like teach them some suggestions and then roll with them.

1064
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And I would, you know, guys are, because you know, we're working hard during the day or during the night.

1065
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And I was kind of making fun of some guys that were taking motrin and I was like, you don't need that.

1066
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You're weak and stuff like that.

1067
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And sure enough, right after we got done, I got something called Burstitis and my elbow because in land warfare,

1068
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:06.000
you're constantly getting down to the desert crawling and then I was in Gitu on the mat and I just banged a couple times and sure enough, my elbow swelled up.

1069
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And I had to take motrin.

1070
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Yeah, don't, don't open your mouth, Jocco.

1071
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Just keep it to yourself.

1072
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
So, you know, again, I was hammering guys, but in a joking manner and so they hammered me right back when I had the,

1073
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
the motrin pills to try and heal that up.

1074
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000
But it is like I said, it's that it's the, the injuries come from not from working out.

1075
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000
In fact, I always think that the working out prevents the injuries, you know, that I think that's true with everything.

1076
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I think that's true with Gitu.

1077
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I think that's true with life.

1078
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
You, you work out your strong, your joints are strong, you, your muscle densities better.

1079
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You're, I mean, just just work out because it'll prevent injuries more than it.

1080
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
More than I don't worry about, I look at working out, not as injury is going to happen.

1081
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I look at working out as injury prevention.

1082
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:06.000
And the last thing is, you shouldn't need to like completely crush yourself every day in your workouts.

1083
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I mean, you shouldn't be going to a point that you have massive muscle soreness over your whole body or over even body parts.

1084
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
You don't need to do that. You don't need to do that.

1085
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You know, do you want to push yourself?

1086
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Yeah, you want to push yourself, but you want to be so sore that you can't perform your job.

1087
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And also, I like, you know, active rest.

1088
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You know, I hardly ever just do nothing.

1089
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Occasionally, I will. Occasionally, I'll just man, I'm broke down.

1090
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Yeah.

1091
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
And just eat steak and just chill.

1092
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But, but I like to do the active rest.

1093
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
You know, I like to do some kind of jog, swim, surf, whatever.

1094
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And, you know, actually, Gitu, like, if I have a sore back, I love getting on the mat.

1095
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Yeah, just loosens everything up, feels so good.

1096
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But, that's only at a certain level.

1097
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Yeah.

1098
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Because when you're a white belt or a blue belt or a purple belt,

1099
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Ben, that's just a battle.

1100
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
You're getting off the mat sore.

1101
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I don't get off the mat sore from Gitu seldom.

1102
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
So do I get off the mat like man, I'm tired.

1103
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I mean, we trained today.

1104
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I'm not, that was a no factor.

1105
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
You know what I mean?

1106
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
You just, oh, yeah, we trained.

1107
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Yeah.

1108
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
If you get into the take down that element, though, that,

1109
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Yeah, but even if you want to, yeah,

1110
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I'll be hard on your back, but even to take down elements, you know,

1111
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
if you're just going to do pure take downs, yeah, but I mean,

1112
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I don't think that's going to last how long, if you're back sore,

1113
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
full guard and work as something else.

1114
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Yeah.

1115
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So that's it.

1116
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And the bottom line is you work out, you do some of these workouts.

1117
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You'll get used to it, you'll get in those own,

1118
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and then you won't be so sore all the time.

1119
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yeah, that, as an advocate of rest, I,

1120
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
that's important that part, where you're like, don't beat your

1121
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
down yourself down.

1122
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Because the exercise that technically,

1123
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
freely split hairs here,

1124
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
the exercise doesn't make you stronger.

1125
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
The recovery from the exercise is when you get stronger.

1126
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
So yeah, the exercise is a part of the whole system that makes you

1127
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
strong, but when you recover from that exercise,

1128
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
that's when you're stronger.

1129
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I'll give you that.

1130
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
So yeah.

1131
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
But the workout itself is what induces the recovery.

1132
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
So sure.

1133
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Yeah, so there you go.

1134
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Well, I guess so it's all kinds of different classes, right?

1135
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Different approaches, like you, you prefer the active rest.

1136
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
And that going hard every day,

1137
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
some people, they prefer go hard every day,

1138
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
but then they'll have a straight up to three days off.

1139
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
That's completely, you know?

1140
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
But yeah, the recovery from the exercise, that's the ticket.

1141
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Yeah, and when I say go hard, I mean, like the muscular,

1142
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
you know, destroy, like if you can do squats until you can't walk,

1143
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
you can't do that all the time.

1144
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Yeah, if you don't need to, right?

1145
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
You need to initiate the growth.

1146
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
You don't need to destroy them.

1147
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Yeah.

1148
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And you can do, you know, you can put with a metabolic conditioning,

1149
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
you can really can destroy yourself a lot more often.

1150
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And if you're doing it right, you shouldn't really be getting musculially sore

1151
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
from your metabolic condition.

1152
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Yeah.

1153
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
If you're doing it right.

1154
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But then again, isn't that really a spectrum as well?

1155
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
It is a spectrum.

1156
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It can be like a heavier.

1157
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Yeah, it can.

1158
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
That's the beauty of workout.

1159
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000
That's why you should never get bored with workout, because you can change it up.

1160
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Next question.

1161
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Jockel, did you ever use GJ to incomet?

1162
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Wouldn't a striking art be better for combat situations?

1163
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Okay, so yes, and definitely.

1164
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
This is one of the things where I was actually,

1165
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I read things about this and people say, well, no,

1166
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I mean, why would a seal ever have to use hand-to-hand combat?

1167
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
They have a rifle, they have a pistol, they've got buddies with them.

1168
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
So if you have to use your hand-to-hand combat, you've done something wrong.

1169
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And that's actually completely wrong.

1170
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Because, you know, it's very simple.

1171
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You go into a room where there's people in there,

1172
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and none of them are armed, and you have to get control of them.

1173
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
You can't just start shooting people.

1174
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
You're going to have to get control of them.

1175
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
So how do you get control of them?

1176
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well, again, how does striking give you control of someone?

1177
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The answer is it does not.

1178
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Unless you have a miracle touch that you can just knock people out with one touch,

1179
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and then you can handcuff them.

1180
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
People don't boxers.

1181
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Don't knock each other out consistently.

1182
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You know, it's very difficult to knock someone out.

1183
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And so this idea that striking is better.

1184
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
You absolutely have to know how to strike.

1185
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000
But striking is a very inconsistent way to get control of somebody.

1186
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Very, very inconsistent way of controlling people.

1187
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And actually, the sad thing is that it's striking is the most traumatic

1188
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
to the person that you're applying it to.

1189
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
And, you know, we used to do something, or we were taught something called a musl strike.

1190
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Right?

1191
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Like, we hit the person with the musl of your gun.

1192
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And the people that were teaching it would be like thinking that that just stopped people.

1193
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Like, oh, you give them one good musl strike.

1194
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Because it does.

1195
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
It seems like, you know, a musl is a very strong, I mean, a very small point of impact.

1196
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And you think, oh, if I put all my force behind this small point of impact, man,

1197
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that's really going to, you know, hurt somebody and take them down.

1198
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And I saw hundreds of musl strikes.

1199
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And they're really brutal. And what they do is they cut you.

1200
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
They cut you open very badly.

1201
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I saw a lot of really bad cuts.

1202
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
With rifle.

1203
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
With rifle.

1204
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And, but they sell them.

1205
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Did they actually knock the person out.

1206
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
So what do you do then?

1207
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
You musl strike them again.

1208
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And then what do you do after that?

1209
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You musl strike them again.

1210
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And what do you do?

1211
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
So you end up just beating them.

1212
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Beat in them.

1213
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But it's a harsh beating because you're using a, you know,

1214
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
a pretty sharp musl of a weapon, which is cutting them open.

1215
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
So it's, it's, it's not the best.

1216
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Whereas if someone can get control of somebody in a grappling type scenario,

1217
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
get control, you know, clench with them, take them down quickly.

1218
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
You can get control very quickly and they feel it.

1219
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And they resist less because they kind of feel owned.

1220
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And they also don't feel like you're hurting them.

1221
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Whereas when you're striking them in a face, man.

1222
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
What's your natural answer?

1223
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Reaction if I strike you in the face.

1224
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
You can put your hands up.

1225
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Well, if you put your hands up, maybe you're trying to attack me.

1226
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Now I got to hit you even harder.

1227
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So it's a, it's kind of a bad deal.

1228
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
So yeah, and then once you get personal underground,

1229
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
obviously the more you know the better you're going to do.

1230
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And that's why, you know, it's good.

1231
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
It's good to have that well roundedness,

1232
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
but you definitely want to use, you know,

1233
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
you definitely want to have a good ground game.

1234
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
You want to have good striking, too, of course.

1235
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And, but the Gigiitsu and the ground,

1236
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
the ground game is very important because you've got to control people.

1237
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And in a combat situation, everybody you come up against is not a combatant.

1238
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And they still need to get controlled.

1239
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And some people, you can just motion to them to get down.

1240
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And that's great.

1241
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And then you can tell them to lay down.

1242
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And that's great.

1243
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And you can have your interpreter,

1244
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
telling them to put their hands behind their back.

1245
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And then that's great.

1246
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Or you can say that, you know, you can learn a few phrases,

1247
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
which we always did.

1248
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
We always knew a few phrases to tell them to, you know,

1249
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
get down, show me your hands or whatever.

1250
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
But then you get the person that maybe they don't respond.

1251
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
To what you're saying.

1252
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And why aren't they responding?

1253
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And this is something I see in some of these police videos.

1254
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:32.000
When I yell at you, you know, get down, get down.

1255
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Well, you might be scared.

1256
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
You might not know what I'm talking about.

1257
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
You might have headphones on.

1258
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
You might be deaf.

1259
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
You might just be frozen with fear.

1260
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yeah.

1261
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
You might be a bad guy.

1262
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
You might be getting ready to run.

1263
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
All those different things.

1264
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
But if you're not doing what I tell you to do,

1265
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I gotta get you to the ground.

1266
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So how am I gonna do that?

1267
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And again, I can walk up and take a swing at you.

1268
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But, you know, I've been punching the face many, many times.

1269
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And been knocked out.

1270
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
But twice.

1271
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
So all the times I've been punching the face.

1272
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
You know, many, many times.

1273
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I don't know how many, but many, many times.

1274
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
It's hard to knock someone out.

1275
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
So if you think, because you walk over and strike someone,

1276
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
you're gonna knock him out.

1277
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Then you're gonna have control.

1278
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It's just a fallacy.

1279
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
So you're gonna have to know some.

1280
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And the thing, this all goes back to this, you know,

1281
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
this case, and I forget what the case was.

1282
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
But somebody got choked years ago, like in the 70s.

1283
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
By a police officer.

1284
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And I think they died or whatever.

1285
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But they banned choking.

1286
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
They banned choking from most police forces.

1287
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
So that's why these guys, what do they do?

1288
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
They pull out their batons.

1289
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
It's our beating people.

1290
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That was a big, big thing with Rodney King.

1291
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
You know, why didn't someone just go and put this guy to sleep?

1292
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And he'd have no marks on his body.

1293
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
You know, he'd be okay.

1294
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
You could bring him back to the jail cell.

1295
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
He's not gonna have conclusions.

1296
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
He's not gonna have the crap you down.

1297
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
We have no permanent damage whatsoever.

1298
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But it wasn't allowed.

1299
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Because of the, because of the political situation that had happened

1300
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
years before you weren't allowed to teach someone how to choke someone

1301
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
and put them to sleep and completely incapacitate them.

1302
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I mean, the chokehold is a beautiful,

1303
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000
and a beautiful thing. And when you have, when you have, I mean, you saw the Rodney King tape.

1304
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I mean, there's, I don't know how many cops are worried,

1305
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
but there's multiple cops beating him.

1306
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
That's a classic example of what I'm saying.

1307
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Just because you strike someone doesn't even with a Billy Club.

1308
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Doesn't mean they're gonna stop.

1309
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Yeah.

1310
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Whereas when you put a chokehold on somebody,

1311
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
they are going to sleep.

1312
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Yeah.

1313
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
They are going to sleep 100%.

1314
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Yeah.

1315
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And when you have three cops going against one guy,

1316
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
someone is going to get a chokehold on.

1317
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Yeah.

1318
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And despite what they did to Rodney King beating him,

1319
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
he wasn't stopping.

1320
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And so, yeah, it's one of those things.

1321
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I really hope that the, the law enforcement gets the ability to use,

1322
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
to train better to use chokeholds,

1323
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
to use other forms of grappling,

1324
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
because it is absolutely superior from a law enforcement perspective

1325
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and from, and from, even from, like I said,

1326
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
from a military perspective

1327
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
when you go into a room and there's non-combatants in there

1328
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
that you have to control over.

1329
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
You don't want to start beating people.

1330
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yeah.

1331
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
You want to use the minimum required force.

1332
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Yeah.

1333
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And yeah, when people aren't compliant,

1334
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
you have to be able to do something.

1335
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yeah.

1336
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
So, yeah, the minimum required force that,

1337
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
essentially makes striking,

1338
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
obsolete if you're trying to approach it that way.

1339
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Or if that's the regulation, you know?

1340
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Yeah.

1341
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
The regulation.

1342
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
If you're, if you're a human,

1343
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
yeah.

1344
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
and you've got a woman that is scared,

1345
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
or doesn't speak your language, or is petrified,

1346
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
or whatever the case may be,

1347
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
your answer is to strike or in the face.

1348
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Right.

1349
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And what is it?

1350
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
By the way, what is her husband do when you strike her in the face?

1351
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
As opposed to if you come over, you put your hands on her.

1352
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You gently push her to ground, you feel some resistance.

1353
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Maybe you have to do some sort of manipulation of a joint

1354
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
to get to control,

1355
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
but that is so much more mild than a musl strike to the

1356
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
face.

1357
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Yeah.

1358
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
And if you know what to do, if you know

1359
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
you get to, it's a no brain.

1360
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Yeah.

1361
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
And it's not hard to do to people.

1362
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
And even, and you'll see sometimes when someone's trying to get,

1363
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
you know, gain control and I'll put their arm behind their back,

1364
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
like chicken wings situation, they'll do it.

1365
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Oh, hard.

1366
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Like real hard.

1367
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Because they kind of got to add that element of pain,

1368
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
so the guy will kind of quote him quote no.

1369
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Most of you, you do it stuff.

1370
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
You don't have to put that pain.

1371
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
It's just that controlling, like you just can't.

1372
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
That's why a lot of people were talking about this today.

1373
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
How a lot of people after they get their first time in juditsu or something

1374
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
or early on in juditsu a guy will tap him out.

1375
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And they'll have this thing in their mind.

1376
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Oh, I just have to go harder.

1377
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
You know, I can just, I can gain some kind of control.

1378
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I just got to go harder, but it's not a hard thing.

1379
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's not like aggressive feeling to get controlled like that.

1380
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
You just simply control.

1381
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And you know, this ties so much to life.

1382
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Yeah.

1383
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Because we talk about, I mean, you hear me talk about this all the time.

1384
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And I was going back and forth with somebody on Twitter the other day about,

1385
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I'm like, you got to use the indirect approach with people.

1386
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Right.

1387
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
So picture this.

1388
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Next time you're dealing with a person that's combative.

1389
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And I mean, now I'm talking about verbally combative or their,

1390
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
their ideas are combative against your combatives.

1391
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Is the first thing you want to do go up and punch him in the face or

1392
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
or musl's strike them?

1393
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Right.

1394
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Because what is their reaction going to be?

1395
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
What their reaction is going to be immediately defensive.

1396
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
You don't want to put people in that predicament.

1397
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You want to use the jutsu on them.

1398
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
You want to, you want to get them feeling comfortable.

1399
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
When you're going to sleep, you, when somebody puts a chokehold on you,

1400
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
you're done.

1401
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I mean, you're just going to sleep.

1402
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
You sneak in behind.

1403
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
So, so don't get this idea that when you're dealing with people in a

1404
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
confrontation, not only physically, but a verbal or a mental

1405
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
confrontation.

1406
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And I'm not even talking about a confrontation in.

1407
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
You know, yelling in the street.

1408
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I'm talking about in the office.

1409
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I'm talking about dealing with one of your subordinates.

1410
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I'm talking about dealing with your boss or whoever think about

1411
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
using instead of thinking about, hey, I'm going to, you know,

1412
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
smash this person in the face and that's going to bring me the win.

1413
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
No, it's not.

1414
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Generally, it is not.

1415
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Generally, what brings you the win is, okay, hey, what's going on?

1416
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Let's sneak in there.

1417
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Let's get inside their head.

1418
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Let's, let's, let's not aggravate the situation.

1419
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Yeah.

1420
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Let's bring the situation towards a better area where we can use our control.

1421
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Yeah, you won't get the win.

1422
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
You'll get a fight.

1423
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Oh, yeah, you definitely get a fight.

1424
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Even though that's not the goal.

1425
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Yeah, you'd be, if they are combative and your answer is to be more combative.

1426
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
You know, and of course they're answering.

1427
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Yeah, you know, their answer is, yeah, even more combative.

1428
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
So, yeah, then you got yourself a fight.

1429
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And then you know, Hannah and then Gracie, they're doing good stuff with law enforcement.

1430
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Using Jiu Jitsu and actual police tactics, so it comes from, you know, it's in context.

1431
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
And you know what, if you're a police officer out there or you're in law enforcement,

1432
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
then you know, Hannah, that's great.

1433
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Guess what?

1434
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
There's a Jiu Jitsu studio everywhere in the country right now.

1435
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Go train some Jiu Jitsu.

1436
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Yeah.

1437
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Just go start training.

1438
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
No big deal.

1439
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Just go start training.

1440
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Yeah.

1441
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I have a friend Craig, he's from from Hawaii.

1442
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
He, um, good cop.

1443
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
He's human, Facebook, I all like reposes stuff sometimes.

1444
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
He'll like, he'll come down to the skate park where they're, you know, he got called or whatever.

1445
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Whatever.

1446
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You posted it and he'll be writing.

1447
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Yeah.

1448
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
He'll do some skating or he'll race somewhere or whatever.

1449
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But he's a Jiu Jitsu guy.

1450
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I think he's a pro-war brown belt.

1451
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Yeah.

1452
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
So he has the confidence.

1453
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Yeah.

1454
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Man.

1455
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
That's what it is.

1456
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
He has the confidence.

1457
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Yeah.

1458
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
He can be a good guy, you know, good guy with the power.

1459
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Next question.

1460
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Jiu Jitsu.

1461
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
How do you prepare for Buds specifically and where were you physically,

1462
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
wise within your class?

1463
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
It must be a physical night around here.

1464
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Physical activity night.

1465
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
That's what the questions are tonight.

1466
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
It seems like.

1467
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
So how did I prepare for Buds?

1468
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Well, again, you got to go back.

1469
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.000
This is now 1989, 1990.

1470
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And out of that prepare for Buds back then, well, we didn't know anything.

1471
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I didn't know anything.

1472
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
There was no media.

1473
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
There was no internet.

1474
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
There was nothing.

1475
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
There wasn't even need books.

1476
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So what did I do?

1477
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
And it wasn't even a Wii.

1478
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
It was just an I because I was alone.

1479
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I didn't know any seals.

1480
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I didn't know any of those in any kind of special operations at all.

1481
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
So you're just young and stupid and just okay.

1482
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So I just looked at it and said,

1483
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:57.000
it appears that seal training is a bunch of running and swimming and pushing pushups and pull ups and

1484
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000
rope climbs and dips.

1485
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Looks to me like in the pictures that the recruiter showed me.

1486
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
They were wearing boots and fatigues.

1487
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
So what did I do?

1488
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Went to the Army Navy store bought a couple pair of fatigue pants, bought a couple pairs of

1489
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:23.000
jungle boots that looked like what I saw in the recruiting office.

1490
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And I just ran with boots on.

1491
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I swam.

1492
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I did full of pushups and dips.

1493
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
That's what I did to get ready for.

1494
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
There was no periodization.

1495
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
And there wasn't any plan.

1496
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
There was no, I wasn't doing the wad.

1497
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
You know, there was no workout of the day.

1498
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I just ran and swam and did full of pushups and dips and I did them a lot.

1499
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And actually, I did them a lot, but I didn't even know what I was capable of or what

1500
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
even a person was capable of.

1501
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Because back then you could look up on the internet and say like what's good as far as

1502
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
pull ups go.

1503
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Yeah.

1504
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I had no idea.

1505
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
You know, so I think I could do 18.

1506
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
That's all it.

1507
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
No, it's not.

1508
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Not when you're going to a seal training.

1509
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But you know, you just had no idea.

1510
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I just said, okay, that's and I didn't know how to do get to be able to do more.

1511
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I mean, I just did a bunch.

1512
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Yeah.

1513
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Does that work though?

1514
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I mean, didn't that work?

1515
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Yeah.

1516
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Yeah.

1517
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
It did.

1518
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Yeah.

1519
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I mean, you do a bunch of pull ups and you get better pull ups.

1520
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You do a bunch of dips.

1521
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
You get better dips.

1522
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
You do a bunch of pushups.

1523
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
You get better pushups.

1524
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
And luckily I ran with boots on.

1525
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
That's one thing that got a lot of guys had trouble with.

1526
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I think nowadays they use these, they're almost like tennis shoes.

1527
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
The boots that they run with are like really light.

1528
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I love it in Buds.

1529
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
They're really light athletic kind of boots.

1530
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But back in the day, they were straight just hardcore jungle boots.

1531
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And a lot of guys had problems, shin splints, stress fractures and all that.

1532
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And I was good to go because I was used to running in boots because I was a knucklehead.

1533
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And then the other part of the question physically were was, I'm my class.

1534
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I was about in the middle of the pack.

1535
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000
That's where I was.

1536
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I was not the fastest.

1537
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
I was not the fastest runner.

1538
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Not the fastest swimmer.

1539
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I wasn't the fastest at the obstacle course.

1540
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I actually failed to run when I decided in my ultimate brilliance that I would just pace myself for this run.

1541
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And failed to run missed the time.

1542
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Because the the the run was supposed to be four miles.

1543
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
But back in those days, there was no supervision on the instructors.

1544
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Like limited supervision, I should say.

1545
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And so that the runs would be four point three miles, four point six miles, four point two miles, three point eight miles.

1546
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
You just didn't really know.

1547
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And it was fine.

1548
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I mean, that's the way it should be.

1549
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And and actually weren't allowed to wear a watch.

1550
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
So you had no idea what you're doing.

1551
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
So I just said, oh, I'm going to pace myself and keep a good steady pace.

1552
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And I failed.

1553
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000
And so from then on, there's only one way I ran.

1554
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I mean, that was as hard as I could.

1555
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
It's literally as hard as I when they blew the whistle to go.

1556
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I just ran as hard as I could until the thing was over.

1557
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Wait, so why did you fail though, like, did you just pace yourself too slowly?

1558
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Or did you pace yourself and then you started gasing anyway?

1559
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
No, I paced myself and it wasn't fast enough.

1560
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
That's it.

1561
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I faced myself and it wasn't fast enough.

1562
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I just.

1563
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
And I was there.

1564
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I was right behind the cutoff point, you know,

1565
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
they're like boom and the guy ahead of me gets through and he, you know, one guy ahead of me gets turned away.

1566
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Like, maybe they're gonna say man.

1567
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
So I never paced myself again. All I could do to sprint.

1568
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
That's, that's the way a lot of the evolutions were from me.

1569
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I had to just go as hard as I could because I wasn't the best at any of it.

1570
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:40.000
And the only thing I was maybe a little bit better out was anything I've talked about this before.

1571
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Anything that I wanted to carry weight like a rock sack.

1572
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I was a little bit better out than normal.

1573
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Not definitely not stellar, but, um, but, you know, I had, uh,

1574
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I had an NCA of NC double a water polo champion in my bud's class.

1575
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And I had a Olympic alternate gymnast in my bud's class.

1576
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And both of those guys were stut at athletes.

1577
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I mean, they're both, I mean, those are some of the top athletes in the world.

1578
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I mean, if you win the uns NC double a championships of water polo

1579
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.000
and you're an Olympic alternate gymnast, you know, you're just a, of specimen.

1580
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And both of those guys quit.

1581
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Dang.

1582
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Yeah.

1583
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And there I was Joe average.

1584
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Yeah.

1585
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
But, uh, yeah.

1586
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
The bottom line is though.

1587
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
You get to the, you get to the steel teams, no one cares about buds,

1588
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
no one cares about that stuff.

1589
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
It's a baseline of training and that's it.

1590
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
That's why I don't talk about it that often.

1591
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
It's like, who cares?

1592
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000
He and Bud did, was there like people who, um, like, let's say I was really good at running miles.

1593
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
You know, was there people who would be, you could tell they were showing off to be like first, you know?

1594
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
No, everyone's trying to win.

1595
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I'm just trying to go first.

1596
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
And if you, if you ran track more cross country, you were going to be fine in buds for running.

1597
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Hmm.

1598
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Unless you got stress fractures.

1599
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Yeah.

1600
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000
If you swam or you played water polo or whatever, you were going to be fine in the running.

1601
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
So if you did some kind of high school sport that was related to those two, you were going to be pretty good to go.

1602
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Yeah.

1603
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Like, oh, so when you say they're trying to win, they're trying to be first.

1604
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Yeah, of course.

1605
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Everyone trying to win.

1606
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Yeah, this is, I mean, right?

1607
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Aren't you?

1608
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I am.

1609
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It seems like, I guess.

1610
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I guess.

1611
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I guess.

1612
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yeah.

1613
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I guess.

1614
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Yeah.

1615
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
You're in that situation, right?

1616
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Do your best.

1617
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
We in.

1618
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Be the guy.

1619
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
The man.

1620
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Next question.

1621
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Let's do it.

1622
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000
One of the most powerful tools I've used as a military leader is rehearsals.

1623
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I would love to hear your thoughts on rehearsals.

1624
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So rehearsals.

1625
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
And this is actually shocking that I've never talked about rehearsals.

1626
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Rehearsals like what?

1627
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Like, oh, we're going to do it.

1628
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Like a dress rehearsal for you.

1629
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Yeah.

1630
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
And they're totally critical.

1631
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And one of the biggest parts of preparing for an operation correctly.

1632
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
You know, we used to have this.

1633
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
They used to say one third planning, one third gear prep and one third rehearsals.

1634
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
That's how you're supposed to spend your time.

1635
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And it's a it's a rule that gets violated very often because people spend too much time planning

1636
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
and not enough time rehearsing.

1637
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
So we would always.

1638
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I would always try and push the rehearsals as much as possible.

1639
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And I would when I was a when I was in charge of troops.

1640
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I would try and push rehearsals.

1641
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000
And then when I was training troops, I would try and get them to rehearse.

1642
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But it's hard.

1643
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Like I said, people get drawn into the planning piece.

1644
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
But a plan without rehearsal is not a plan really.

1645
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So, you know, definitely use the rehearsals rehearses much as you can.

1646
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Be hard on yourself during rehearsals rehearsals.

1647
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
We're hers contingencies.

1648
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
That's something we used to do that I was pretty intent on.

1649
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Was rehearsing the contingencies.

1650
01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000
So what could go wrong here?

1651
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
What could go different at the target area?

1652
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
What's a different alternate route that we might have to hit the target from?

1653
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And just just go through a couple of those contingencies.

1654
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
And actually when you do that, make sure you if you rehearse a couple of contingencies.

1655
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
If you rehearse your main plan, let's say you walk through it three times.

1656
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Then you rehearse two or three contingencies.

1657
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Go back and do the main plan two more times.

1658
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Just so that's what they leave with.

1659
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
You want that in their heads.

1660
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You want that in their heads because otherwise they'll be a little bit of confusion.

1661
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
But you definitely want to rehearse some contingencies as well.

1662
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
And we also would rehearse the things that were.

1663
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
The things that happened all the time.

1664
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:47.000
So even you know, a good example was was like our breach team, which is the team that kind of goes in to blow up a door.

1665
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000
So you can get in the building and they have their little procedures.

1666
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
We'd rehearse that breach team would rehearse over and over and over again.

1667
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
So that they're really just smooth and good and then don't have to talk and they can do things very quickly.

1668
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000
And you know, the way we got into vehicles and out of vehicles, we always rehearse that.

1669
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Even though we'd rehearse it by me by the end of deployment, you've rehearsed that hundreds of times.

1670
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And you still go, hey, dismount the vehicles and get information.

1671
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Because it's just another time more muscle memory for everybody.

1672
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
And you could do it with all the stuff that you do in the field.

1673
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
You know, whether you're calling it a helicopter for a casualty of evacuation.

1674
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
How you're going to set up that landing zone, you rehearse that a few times.

1675
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Just do it, you know, a couple times before you roll out an operation.

1676
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
That way when it happens, everybody knows what to do.

1677
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And this obviously translates directly to everything else.

1678
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I mean, especially in business.

1679
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.000
I mean, we work with construction companies and, you know, I talk a lot of times talk about safety with construction companies.

1680
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Because they lose lives.

1681
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
They lose money.

1682
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
They lose jobs because they have, if they have safety incidences.

1683
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And how do they handle when they happen? What do you do?

1684
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
So, you know, rehearse in the emergency procedures.

1685
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000
If when something happens, rehearsing the setup before you start a certain type of, you know, construction operation.

1686
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
That's good.

1687
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Even with the sales world.

1688
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Like when I, when I, you know, a lot of teams that.

1689
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Every business has, well, just about every business has some sort of sales force in it, right?

1690
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
With that, or trying to sell things.

1691
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And how do you rehearse for them? Well, you do some role playing.

1692
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Where, you know, somebody gets on and plays the super hard client.

1693
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
You know, somebody gets on and complains.

1694
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
How do you, Laila, let's rehearse.

1695
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Let's, how are you going to talk through when somebody calls up to complain?

1696
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.000
And in two or three iterations, people will improve on how they handle complaints and how they handle a super hard client.

1697
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
How they overcome some objections.

1698
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
But you do that through rehearsal.

1699
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And it makes you just make you better.

1700
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.000
You know, it's, you know, that the, I mean, another rehearsal would be like a, we work with a gas oil industry.

1701
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
So how are they going to handle when there is a leak?

1702
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
How are they going to handle when there's some kind of a ecological problem or a fire?

1703
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
What are you going to do?

1704
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
You know, oh, you're going to dial this number.

1705
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Okay, let's check that that number makes works.

1706
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
How long has that number been in this little pamphlet that's been sitting by the phone?

1707
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
You know, when's the last time that got checked out?

1708
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Where's, where is the communications notes?

1709
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
What if they get hit? What's the alternative plan?

1710
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.000
So just, yeah, rehearsals are awesome. The finance world we see it as well.

1711
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.000
What kind, what if there's a drastic downturn in the market or a drastic upturn?

1712
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Do you have a rehearsed plan of what you're going to do?

1713
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Who you're going to contact if you have decisions to make?

1714
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Triggers have been hit.

1715
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Just rehearse that stuff.

1716
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Yeah.

1717
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Just rehearse it.

1718
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So everybody knows.

1719
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
And it's very, very helpful.

1720
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I know when I was in charge of training, I had a very,

1721
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
very square away and fired up a corpsman who is our medical support.

1722
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
And he just, you know, I talked about rehearsals one time or whatever.

1723
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And he came to me and said, hey, we're going to rehearse all of our casualty evacuations for all of our different training sites.

1724
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
So, and he did it and he'd come back and he'd find, you know, hey, guess what?

1725
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
This is what I found on this one.

1726
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
The life flight that we were supposed to call didn't exist anymore.

1727
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
They went out of business or they changed their number or whatever.

1728
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Or this LZ that we were planning on using has a house on it now.

1729
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
You know, and so he found real stuff.

1730
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And you know what?

1731
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
This particular guy, a great guy.

1732
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
He, in that time he got all those casualty evacuations plans squared away.

1733
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000
And in that year, we actually did two real casualty evacuations from training sites for real critical injuries.

1734
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
And both of them went super smooth all because of his efforts.

1735
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And they ran full rehearsals, full rehearsals.

1736
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
And so just, just that kind of thing.

1737
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000
And then those things saved lives are for sure.

1738
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Just doing those full rehearsals.

1739
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000
So yes, rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse in anything that you're doing.

1740
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Because it'll make you better.

1741
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Yes, but I should, or you, I would think that any time you're in a situation where being on the spot is a big factor.

1742
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
You know, where you have to make a decision quick.

1743
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.000
You know, you don't have a day or two days to, you know, analyze and make a decision.

1744
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I feel like that would rehearse would be a critical part of preparing for something like that.

1745
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Yeah, and you can do that with the decision making sure you can set up all kinds of rehearsals for decision making in whatever industry you're in.

1746
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Just, but what I like to do is make those decisions critical.

1747
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Make those challenging so that you're putting somebody on the spot.

1748
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
You're putting a leader in the spot.

1749
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And I'll tell you what, one thing that's very cool about this.

1750
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
And this is something you can carry over to everything you do.

1751
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000
It goes to decentralized command. It goes to instilling initiative in people.

1752
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:54.000
You run rehearsals where the only solution is to go outside the box of the plan during the rehearsals.

1753
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
During the rehearsals.

1754
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Yeah, and then rehearsal where the only solution is to disobey what the order is.

1755
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Oh, thank you.

1756
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Yeah.

1757
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And the reason I'm bringing this up specifically is because you're talking about rehearsing when there's decisions that need to be made.

1758
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So this is going a little bit from rehearsal, almost into a training scenario.

1759
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Right.

1760
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:21.000
So we're getting away from rehearsal where you're rehearsing a specific operation into a training scenario where what you're trying to do in training is you're trying to get people to think.

1761
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
You're trying to get people to think on their own.

1762
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And that is the most beautiful thing that you want as a leader is you want all your people thinking.

1763
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000
And you want them to be able to think with a completely open mind of mind that's been completely freed from constraints.

1764
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000
And the way that you do that, one of the ways that you do that, one of the methodologies you can use to do that is everybody's got their box, right?

1765
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
That they're stuck in.

1766
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:51.000
So you formulate a problem that the only way that they're going to solve the problem is to get outside of that box.

1767
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And you know, one of the, one of the best ones is you put somebody in a situation where you put parameters on them.

1768
01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And you say, hey, no matter what, you're not allowed to go across this line.

1769
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
And then you put them in a situation where they have to cross that line.

1770
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
And the only way they're going to win us across that line.

1771
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
And then they come back and they say, well, you didn't tell me not to cross that line.

1772
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
You know what?

1773
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I didn't tell you to get you all your guys killed.

1774
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Or I didn't tell you to not make that investment even in this critical situation.

1775
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Or I didn't tell you not to do that if we had an ecological disaster that was going on, right?

1776
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000
So you need to train people to use common sense.

1777
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:36.000
That's what you want to train them to do. And it's very hard. You'd be surprised at how, at how constrained people's brains get.

1778
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Mine, yours, everybody, we get stuck.

1779
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And so it's great to do drilling and training where you are actually opening up the mind and freeing the mind from any kind of constraint.

1780
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Where you can see things from varied perspectives that are different from your own.

1781
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And you can see outlets and solutions that you would never have seen if you trap yourself inside your box.

1782
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And those are the kind of training scenarios that are outstanding.

1783
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:10.000
And those are the kind of training scenarios that make people better leaders and better decision makers.

1784
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Because the key thing that they learn how to do is they learn how to detach even at that moment.

1785
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
We talk about it all the time.

1786
01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:28.000
But if you can't detach from that situation, you can't detach far enough away from the picture to see that the only way you're going to solve this problem is by going across that line that you were told not to go across.

1787
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
If you can't make that detachment, you're never going to cross that line.

1788
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
You're never going to open your mind. You're never going to see that solution.

1789
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And that is a horrible trap to be stuck in.

1790
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And then we would be boiler room where they during the training they give them, you know, it's a sales thing.

1791
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
They even indexed all these index cards with rebuttals.

1792
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Like, oh my wife won't let me buy this.

1793
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
You know, oh your wife runs your family.

1794
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1795
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Give it to you.

1796
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I have seen it.

1797
01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I have seen it.

1798
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yeah, there's some good good training in there and how to overcome those objections.

1799
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
And people become better at it.

1800
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And the more you give them to chew on the better they'll get out.

1801
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
It's the same thing where you're trying to give people the tools.

1802
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But you know, I want to go into that scenario and I want to ask them a question when I'm training them that they've never,

1803
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I want to give them a rejection that they've never heard before.

1804
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000
What them think on their feet?

1805
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Let them see, let them step back and say, hey, you know what this one's on the cards?

1806
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Where am I going to go with it?

1807
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Right. Yeah, the card seems like that would fall within rehearsal.

1808
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Right. Right. Right.

1809
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
It's expanded rehearsal.

1810
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Yeah, I bet you they get 95% of the, of the common amount of time.

1811
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
The common objections that you get, you know, you talk to a car salesman.

1812
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
They hear X amount of objections.

1813
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
You talk to a phone salesman or an internet salesman or a, you know,

1814
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000
whoever calls you up on the phone, they hear the same, the solar people, right?

1815
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
The solar people call you all the time or the power company calls you with this or the cable company,

1816
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
the other cable company calls you with their offer.

1817
01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
They hear the same objections all the time.

1818
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
You know what I mean?

1819
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
So they train for those for sure.

1820
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000
And the other of coming out of bonds and they're like, hey, you know,

1821
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
hey, you know, hey, come here.

1822
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I got something to check this out is the ones where you can do,

1823
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000
sponsor child, one of those kinds of things, right?

1824
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
So I was like, hey, you know, yeah, you know, we, we don't eat,

1825
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:25.000
but we like to research and look into it and before I could really finish the sentence,

1826
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I was going to say we, I like to look into all the programs that we donate to or think or consider

1827
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
donating to before I could finish the sound right when I finished the sentence.

1828
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
He was like, a lot of people are concerned about where the money goes and all the stuff and he knew everything

1829
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
as a body's guys are getting in that.

1830
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
There they are.

1831
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Emma.

1832
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
So he's prepared. He rehearsed.

1833
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Good for him.

1834
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
It was trained.

1835
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Next question.

1836
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Joko for the podcast.

1837
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
What's your opinion on calisthenics versus weights?

1838
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Again, for me, both.

1839
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:05.000
You know, with calisthenics, you get that endurance strength, you get some flexibility and

1840
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
some mobility out of it.

1841
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
They're pretty natural movements, right?

1842
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
They're pretty natural movements.

1843
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
They're things that you're doing with your human body.

1844
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So they're going to be more natural.

1845
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Wates.

1846
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Obviously, make you stronger.

1847
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
More explosive.

1848
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Add a certain point.

1849
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
They also can be more injury-inducing.

1850
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:33.000
So there's a certain point where if you have an injury in your shoulder and you normally

1851
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:40.000
would do handstand pushups, which means you're lifting up 230 pounds, well, with weight training,

1852
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
you could lift up 40 pounds if you want to.

1853
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000
So there's it goes both ways where sometimes calisthenics might be the more injury-inducing thing.

1854
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
And sometimes weight training might be the more important.

1855
01:59:49.000 --> 02:00:01.000
That's the way you've got to balance the two of them.

1856
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:08.000
And for instance, when I, if I, like, hurt my ankle, a couple months ago, and I could not

1857
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
put any weight on the scrap art.

1858
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:16.000
So I was just doing, you know, pistols and, you know, air squats, jumps and box jumps.

1859
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
You know, as using things that didn't have any weight because I could do all that, but the minute I put weight on my back,

1860
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000
you know, anything above body weight, it started to hurt.

1861
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And so I just needed to let that thing heal.

1862
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And I used the calisthenics to get me there.

1863
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
And then the same exact opposite I had, my shoulder was tweaked six months ago.

1864
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And I was having a hard time doing handstand pushups because it was just a wrong angle.

1865
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And so I was just using, just using, I was doing press with a lighter weight than my body.

1866
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.000
In order to keep the blood moving in order to keep the, in order to keep the system moving.

1867
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Because that's what I think you've got to do.

1868
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So I think you've got to be, you've got to find a balance of both, which means,

1869
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
which means I'm not great at either one of them.

1870
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I'm not going to win in any weightlifting competitions.

1871
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000
And I'm not going to win in a gymnastics competition either.

1872
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And there are some guys, especially now.

1873
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I mean, there are some guys that are getting in sick shape.

1874
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
You know, you watch the guys in the CrossFit games right now.

1875
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
They're savages.

1876
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
And they're doing both the calisthenics and the weightlifting.

1877
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
And I just reading something about it the other day.

1878
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
And it's becoming more weightlifting focused.

1879
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
You know, whether it's a one weightweight.

1880
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
What is CrossFit?

1881
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Okay.

1882
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I shouldn't say it's getting that more focused.

1883
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
But if you want to win the CrossFit games,

1884
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
you've got to be able to lift some heavy weights.

1885
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
You've got to be able to deadlift a lot.

1886
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Snatch a lot, clean and jerk a lot.

1887
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And if you can deadlift a lot, clean and jerk a lot.

1888
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
And snatch a lot, you're going to be able to do.

1889
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And at least you practice the other movements, the muscle of the pull-ups.

1890
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:03.000
You're going to be much more apt to be able to do those things than the other way around.

1891
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
So, I mean, it's for somebody that can,

1892
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:16.000
somebody that can do a bodyweight snatch is more likely to be able to do 50 pull-ups in a row.

1893
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Then somebody that's able to do 50 pull-ups in a row.

1894
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
And that's their focus in life is able to automatically do a bodyweight snatch.

1895
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

1896
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
That's what I think right now.

1897
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But the bottom line is on those.

1898
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
I use both of them.

1899
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I like to try and find that balance.

1900
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And I think I use both of them according to what my body prescribes me.

1901
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:46.000
And a lot of this stuff, I'm going to put in the ebook together.

1902
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
The fitness ebook.

1903
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
So, I got some folks that are helping me out with it.

1904
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000
And they're going to, you know, I'm going to put these,

1905
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
these things into the fitness ebook.

1906
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
At some point, I don't know when it's going to get out.

1907
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And stuff takes a long, you don't think it's going to take long.

1908
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
But it does.

1909
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
It takes long.

1910
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It's the calcettings versus weights.

1911
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
It depends fully on what result you want.

1912
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
That is true.

1913
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000
So, and I think a lot of times you speak kind of from the same, you know,

1914
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
with the same results in mind.

1915
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
But like, if you want to put on muscle mass,

1916
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
it's real cutting dry that weight is going to help you.

1917
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
And you know what's in my opinion,

1918
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
interesting with, like, kind of calcettings.

1919
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Let's say body weights quats, right?

1920
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Anything where you're pushing your own body through space.

1921
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Not necessarily with the weight, but as far as that exercise has more

1922
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
neuromuscular activation.

1923
02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
So, if you do squats rather than leg press,

1924
02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
that has more neuromuscular activation.

1925
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Oh, yeah.

1926
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
But I mean, I'm not saying that the,

1927
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000
but you're talking about also weighted squats.

1928
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Yes, exactly.

1929
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1930
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
But yeah, so basically what I'm saying is it's kind of,

1931
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I haven't used any kind of weight lifting machine

1932
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
and I don't remember how long.

1933
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Yeah.

1934
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
So like curls, you know, I always do curls all the time.

1935
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Like if you did.

1936
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Close your body, so somebody posted,

1937
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
somebody posted a picture of some of the bumper stickers

1938
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
on their squat rack.

1939
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
And somebody said, we need to make a bumper sticker

1940
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
that said like, this is a no curl.

1941
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Yeah, which I got to, which I got to big kick out.

1942
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And you know what, though?

1943
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I will say this.

1944
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
That being said, I don't think I've said that this.

1945
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Sure.

1946
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I'll tell you what, I have a bicep that's been a little bit

1947
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
bothersome.

1948
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
You know, it's got a little tweak in it.

1949
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Like that for a while.

1950
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Yeah, it's been like that for a while.

1951
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Yeah.

1952
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
And I actually will now do some curls.

1953
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
To get just to get that full range of motion

1954
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
with some weight on it.

1955
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And I feel like that is I feel like I should have

1956
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
kept doing curls.

1957
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And maybe I injured my bicep a little bit

1958
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
from the lack of some focus training around it.

1959
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000
I could be wrong.

1960
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I could be wrong, but I feel suspect of my training methodology

1961
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
because I hadn't done curls in a long, long time

1962
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
because you know, you're thinking, hey, why would I do curls

1963
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
when I could do cleans, right?

1964
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Sure.

1965
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
That's sort of a, that's my mentality.

1966
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
But now I think, you know what?

1967
02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Do cleans and then do curls too.

1968
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Yeah.

1969
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
You know, work the bicep and the same thing with the

1970
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
with the triceps and the same thing with all these,

1971
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
you know, movements that I kind of pretend to blow off

1972
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
because they're not full body,

1973
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
multi-joint movements, which is sort of the gospel of

1974
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
strength and conditioning.

1975
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
You know, I want to do squats.

1976
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I want to do deadlifts.

1977
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I want to do clean jerks.

1978
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I want to do these movements where I'm using my whole body.

1979
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
But I think, you know what?

1980
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Why not accent those with

1981
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
some a little bit more focused just for the

1982
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:02.000
the additional work on a focused area and the benefit

1983
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
that that gives you of strength in that specific spot.

1984
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
So yeah.

1985
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I'm sure I'd love to hear some opinions about that on,

1986
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
you know, some of you get some feedback to me and tell me

1987
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I'm either an idiot or that those are correct.

1988
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
And if I, I hope I hear it's correct because I'll do it

1989
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
more than I do right now.

1990
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
What? Like curls and stuff?

1991
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Just just more focused on focused body part exercises.

1992
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Well again, and I think this is really important.

1993
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
And of course, you're working out for you, of course.

1994
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I mean, that's just the nature of working out.

1995
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000
You can't, someone else can't get your results from your working out.

1996
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Right.

1997
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.000
So again, like I said, it depends on what you want out of working out

1998
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
through. So you know how you just said, like,

1999
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
that's the gospel of strength and conditioning.

2000
02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
It's not a full body weight.

2001
02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
So you prefer these things.

2002
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
That's not everybody. You know, so so if, let's say someone who's,

2003
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
you know, he's worked in office or whatever, he wants to lose some weight.

2004
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Or he's kind of a, you know, more of a skinny person.

2005
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
And he wants to put on muscle mass for a bunch of reasons.

2006
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
And he wants to get stronger.

2007
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
He wants to be able to like push.

2008
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
But those people should do squat and deadlift.

2009
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Sure.

2010
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Yeah. Agreed.

2011
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.000
But if you want to put on muscle mass like in your shoulders or your arms,

2012
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000
both everything, you do these other things, curls.

2013
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Yeah.

2014
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
And you know, not everyone's for that.

2015
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000
But that's not to say that that's not a beneficial type of workout.

2016
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Yeah. That's a reality.

2017
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Yeah.

2018
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Not a reality that I choose to protest.

2019
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
But you're already kind of, you know, you have muscle mass.

2020
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
So it's easy, you know.

2021
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
You say.

2022
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Yeah.

2023
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Yes. On hate on the body building program.

2024
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000
No, not.

2025
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
There's no hate coming from me.

2026
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Not watching anyways.

2027
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
All right. Cool. Last question.

2028
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
I'm going to write my ebook on don't hate on the body building.

2029
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Help me write it.

2030
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
I want to copy.

2031
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Joko.

2032
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Do you ever compromise?

2033
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
And if so, when?

2034
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:06.000
When you're dealing with other people in dynamic situations and relationships,

2035
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000
deals, you're trying to make things happen, of course. Yes.

2036
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
And so, in fact, I mean, in many aspects, leadership is really all about compromise.

2037
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:28.000
You're about finding the common ground between different teams and merging different approaches to the same problem.

2038
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:38.000
And bridging these personalities of the people that don't get along with each other, that you might not get along with.

2039
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000
And reaching agreements in different courses of actions, all these things.

2040
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000
They all require compromise.

2041
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000
And actually, in many cases, the failure to compromise is a failure to succeed.

2042
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:02.000
That's just the way it is.

2043
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:18.000
And those, of course, those are all external compromises with other people, other human beings that have their own personalities and egos and issues.

2044
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.000
And you as a person or I, I have to work with them.

2045
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I have to make some compromises with them because they're not me.

2046
02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:38.000
But internally, it's different.

2047
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
I mean, with myself, I have to hold the line.

2048
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.000
And there's areas within myself where I cannot compromise.

2049
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I'm going to work hard. I'm going to train hard.

2050
02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I'm going to try and improve myself.

2051
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I'm going to own my mistakes.

2052
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I'm going to confront them.

2053
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I'm going to face my demons.

2054
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And I'm not going to give up or give out or give in.

2055
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I'm going to stand.

2056
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I'm going to maintain my personal self-discipline.

2057
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:51.000
And do my utmost to live a life that is worthy of the sacrifices that were made for me and for us.

2058
02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:01.000
And on those points, there will be no compromise.

2059
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Not now, not ever.

2060
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2061
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:27.000
So thanks to all YouTubers out there for tuning in and listening.

2062

And thanks for gutting it out.

2063
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:39.000
When it gets dark here, and we start talking about the horror.

2064
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.000
The horror tonight, one soldier's war, and when we did it with the forgotten Highlander,

2065
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:52.000
we did it with Mishedi season. I know it's hard to listen to.

2066
02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
But I'll tell you.

2067
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Doesn't it just make the sunrise in the morning that much more glorious when the light comes in New

2068
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
World?

2069
