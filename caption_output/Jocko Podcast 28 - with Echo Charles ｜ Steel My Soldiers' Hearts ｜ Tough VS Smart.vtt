00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 28 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.96
He was a mate, a real good mate he was, a friendly sword of fella, like the joke.

3
00:00:19.96 --> 00:00:26.56
And if it had to happen, it's a shame it had to happen to such a decent bloke.

4
00:00:26.56 --> 00:00:34.000
But ah, fair, dingham, don't it make you wonder what God in heaven's thinking about up there?

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The way he chooses who disagrees to me, it doesn't quite seem fair.

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.64
You'd think he'd want a bloke to take a bloke like me, who'd be no loss to no one here

7
00:00:47.64 --> 00:00:50.24
on earth.

8
00:00:50.24 --> 00:00:59.68
But no, he always seems to pick the best, whose life amounts to ten times what mine's worth.

9
00:00:59.68 --> 00:01:04.48
Now there's a sort of aching here inside.

10
00:01:04.48 --> 00:01:10.68
I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong, but a soldier can't afford to feel this way.

11
00:01:10.68 --> 00:01:16.16
He's got a grittest teeth and carry on.

12
00:01:16.16 --> 00:01:19.16
So how's the bloke supposed to deal with this?

13
00:01:19.16 --> 00:01:23.08
I know they trained me well, I can't complain.

14
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:28.08
But this is something you don't learn about when they teach you how to play the soldier's

15
00:01:28.08 --> 00:01:31.40
game.

16
00:01:31.40 --> 00:01:35.08
They teach you how to shoot and how to kill.

17
00:01:35.08 --> 00:01:38.56
You even learn which enemy to hate.

18
00:01:38.56 --> 00:01:51.64
But nowhere in their training, do you learn how to live with the loss of a real good mate?

19
00:01:51.64 --> 00:01:55.48
Good evening, echo.

20
00:01:55.48 --> 00:02:03.12
That is an excerpt from a poem called, He Was A Mate by a man named Lacklin Irvine.

21
00:02:03.12 --> 00:02:11.76
He was an Australian guy served in Vietnam as part of the three R.A.R. or the third battalion,

22
00:02:11.76 --> 00:02:17.32
Royal Australian Regiment.

23
00:02:17.32 --> 00:02:22.68
And you look at the Vietnam War and there was definitely some major advances in terms

24
00:02:22.68 --> 00:02:30.16
of technology because they had now things like helicopters and better radios and they had

25
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:35.96
the beginning of night vision and they had jets and better communication.

26
00:02:35.96 --> 00:02:46.24
But even with all those technological changes, the basic principles of combat remain the same.

27
00:02:46.24 --> 00:02:47.24
They always do.

28
00:02:47.24 --> 00:02:48.24
Cover and move.

29
00:02:48.24 --> 00:02:49.88
Keep the simple prioritized.

30
00:02:49.88 --> 00:02:54.88
Next, Q.D. centralized command.

31
00:02:54.88 --> 00:03:00.12
But in addition to those technological changes, there was differences now with the people.

32
00:03:00.12 --> 00:03:09.12
Obviously in Vietnam, there was a massive anti-war movement in America and around the world.

33
00:03:09.12 --> 00:03:19.72
And in America, a lot of the troops were drafties.

34
00:03:19.72 --> 00:03:23.56
Now this is my after explain all the time I have explained it on here before and that

35
00:03:23.56 --> 00:03:30.04
is that seals and soldiers and marines are not robots.

36
00:03:30.04 --> 00:03:36.32
And even though seals, for instance, have always been a volunteer force and today all the

37
00:03:36.32 --> 00:03:40.04
military in the US is all volunteers.

38
00:03:40.04 --> 00:03:50.24
They're still free thinking individuals, their people, their humans and you have to lead them.

39
00:03:50.24 --> 00:03:57.48
But what's interesting is when you look at the leadership principles used to effectively

40
00:03:57.48 --> 00:04:05.92
lead troops today, it's the same leadership principles to effectively lead the drafties in

41
00:04:05.92 --> 00:04:07.72
Vietnam.

42
00:04:07.72 --> 00:04:15.76
Drafties or volunteers, conventional forces or special operators or civilian teams and companies

43
00:04:15.76 --> 00:04:23.28
and organization of fundamental leadership principles used to actually lead.

44
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:27.16
They do not change at their core.

45
00:04:27.16 --> 00:04:32.16
And there's a great example of this.

46
00:04:32.16 --> 00:04:36.76
And again, we're going back to a guy by the name of Colonel David Hackworth who wrote about

47
00:04:36.76 --> 00:04:37.76
face.

48
00:04:37.76 --> 00:04:39.32
We talked about him before in this podcast.

49
00:04:39.32 --> 00:04:45.40
That book is it's actually my favorite book of any category.

50
00:04:45.40 --> 00:04:52.08
But definitely within the realm of combat and combat leadership about face by David Hackworth,

51
00:04:52.08 --> 00:04:55.68
Colonel David Hackworth is at the top of my list.

52
00:04:55.68 --> 00:05:04.44
But he actually went into even more detail about one particular episode of his career.

53
00:05:04.44 --> 00:05:10.48
And that was when he took over a battalion in Vietnam that was in pretty rough shape.

54
00:05:10.48 --> 00:05:16.80
And he wrote about that particular experience in more detail in a book called The Steel

55
00:05:16.80 --> 00:05:22.24
My Soldier's Hearts.

56
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:32.04
It is about the subtitle is the hopeless to hardcore transformation of US Army 4th Battalion

57
00:05:32.04 --> 00:05:39.64
39th infantry in Vietnam.

58
00:05:39.64 --> 00:05:47.24
And let's go ahead and jump on in.

59
00:05:47.24 --> 00:05:54.76
Three times before 1969, I'd made the same 18 hour trip across the Pacific to Southeast Asia.

60
00:05:54.76 --> 00:05:56.60
Nothing had changed.

61
00:05:56.60 --> 00:06:04.04
The plane was full of FNGs, fucking new guys, 19 and 20 year olds, pink chick, chick, dry

62
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:09.24
mouth, wide-eyed, eager but scared.

63
00:06:09.24 --> 00:06:14.28
One more load of fresh meat for the Vietnam grinder.

64
00:06:14.28 --> 00:06:19.80
I couldn't help wondering which one of them the KIA travel bureau would be bagging up

65
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:23.16
for their return trip home.

66
00:06:23.16 --> 00:06:34.08
Even the lucky ones, the ones who made it out alive would never be the same.

67
00:06:34.08 --> 00:06:36.72
And he talks about arriving, so it gets to Vietnam.

68
00:06:36.72 --> 00:06:42.12
And he talks about arriving in the headquarters, kind of general U.S. headquarters.

69
00:06:42.12 --> 00:06:45.80
You've heard me talk about this before about how some of the bases on Iraq, they were really,

70
00:06:45.80 --> 00:06:47.40
really nice.

71
00:06:47.40 --> 00:06:50.76
All built up, they had Starbucks on them, they had swimming pools, they had nice gyms,

72
00:06:50.76 --> 00:06:53.60
they had movie theaters.

73
00:06:53.60 --> 00:06:59.04
On bases in Iraq, I know, it sounds crazy for people that didn't go there.

74
00:06:59.04 --> 00:07:00.36
But that's what America does.

75
00:07:00.36 --> 00:07:05.64
We have awesome logistics, we have awesome support, we have a really well funded and you

76
00:07:05.64 --> 00:07:09.52
know what, we had a build a big base over there, we're going to make it pretty nice.

77
00:07:09.52 --> 00:07:15.84
And it's the same thing here that hackworth rolls into an in Vietnam.

78
00:07:15.84 --> 00:07:17.32
Here we go, back to the book.

79
00:07:17.32 --> 00:07:21.28
I walked off the pad and jumped into a Jeep with a kid behind it's wheel waiting to run

80
00:07:21.28 --> 00:07:24.32
me over to general U.S. headquarters.

81
00:07:24.32 --> 00:07:26.32
The ride was an eye opener.

82
00:07:26.32 --> 00:07:33.84
Nearly 10,000 rear echelon mother fuckers, ramps to the grunts out on the line.

83
00:07:33.84 --> 00:07:38.64
We're stationed in Dong Tam surrounded by all the creature comforts.

84
00:07:38.64 --> 00:07:42.68
I saw a miniature golf course and a swimming pool.

85
00:07:42.68 --> 00:07:48.28
I caught a glimpse inside of barracks decked out with clean beds under mosquito nets.

86
00:07:48.28 --> 00:07:53.48
These guys pulled down the same combat pay as the soldiers in the bush who lived in the mud,

87
00:07:53.48 --> 00:08:01.44
watched their feet rot, burning leeches out of their crutches and laying down their lives.

88
00:08:01.44 --> 00:08:06.28
So that's a common term as a wrenth comes from Vietnam, we're rational on mother fucker,

89
00:08:06.28 --> 00:08:12.24
obviously lay for nine named our business echelon front because we wanted to be that we

90
00:08:12.24 --> 00:08:16.88
wanted to be perfectly clear to everybody that we were not talking about leadership from

91
00:08:16.88 --> 00:08:21.04
the rear, what you're talking about leadership from the front.

92
00:08:21.04 --> 00:08:26.08
So hackworth goes in, he spends a half an hour with general U.L. and he kind of gets

93
00:08:26.08 --> 00:08:30.76
told what's what and then he kind of gives his assessment of what he's heard.

94
00:08:30.76 --> 00:08:34.64
He says pragmatically, I could do nothing about the chain of command and the tactical

95
00:08:34.64 --> 00:08:37.60
operational stupidity of don't have.

96
00:08:37.60 --> 00:08:43.76
I'd be out of U.L. and hunts eyesight soon enough and worrying about how combat operations

97
00:08:43.76 --> 00:08:50.16
were being handled from above was a waste of time at best and got men killed at worst.

98
00:08:50.16 --> 00:08:53.40
There'd be ways around that.

99
00:08:53.40 --> 00:08:57.68
The reason I highlighted that paragraph is because a lot of times I get asked questions

100
00:08:57.68 --> 00:09:01.80
from troopers out there that say, hey, you know, I got this issue with my boss, my boss

101
00:09:01.80 --> 00:09:04.20
is doing this, my boss is doing that.

102
00:09:04.20 --> 00:09:06.08
This is what I try and tell them.

103
00:09:06.08 --> 00:09:09.36
Look, it doesn't really matter.

104
00:09:09.36 --> 00:09:13.12
You know, you got to get out there in the field and you make some space and then you execute

105
00:09:13.12 --> 00:09:14.12
how you execute.

106
00:09:14.12 --> 00:09:18.68
You know, I'm not saying you're going to disobey, but people can't control you.

107
00:09:18.68 --> 00:09:21.72
And as long as you're accomplishing the mission, you're finding the best way to do it,

108
00:09:21.72 --> 00:09:23.36
you're going to be fine.

109
00:09:23.36 --> 00:09:27.72
So don't get all caught up and exactly what the boss is saying.

110
00:09:27.72 --> 00:09:30.48
Let's figure out what the spirit of what the boss is saying.

111
00:09:30.48 --> 00:09:34.08
Let's see what they want to get accomplished and then you go out and make it happen.

112
00:09:34.08 --> 00:09:38.88
There's no boss should be telling you something that's completely out of sync with what

113
00:09:38.88 --> 00:09:39.88
your goals are.

114
00:09:39.88 --> 00:09:43.40
I mean, damn sure in the military, you shouldn't be in told something like, hey, get your

115
00:09:43.40 --> 00:09:47.24
guys killed or give up sensitive information or lose the war.

116
00:09:47.24 --> 00:09:48.24
No one's going to tell you to do that.

117
00:09:48.24 --> 00:09:49.92
They're going to tell you to keep your guys alive.

118
00:09:49.92 --> 00:09:51.88
They're going to tell you to make progress on the battlefield.

119
00:09:51.88 --> 00:09:58.28
So when you get that sort of when you pull that commanders intent out of people and you

120
00:09:58.28 --> 00:10:02.40
know what it is that they want you to accomplish, go forward and accomplish it.

121
00:10:02.40 --> 00:10:06.48
Don't get all caught up in the little details that you might not agree with.

122
00:10:06.48 --> 00:10:14.48
They're not going to make that big of a difference out there.

123
00:10:14.48 --> 00:10:20.80
Now as I said, this book is actually about the transformation of the fourth Battalion 39th

124
00:10:20.80 --> 00:10:21.80
infantry.

125
00:10:21.80 --> 00:10:25.16
So he's flying out and he talked about this about in about face and we actually covered

126
00:10:25.16 --> 00:10:26.16
it on the podcast.

127
00:10:26.16 --> 00:10:27.72
This is a little bit more detail.

128
00:10:27.72 --> 00:10:34.52
So I find it, I find it to be more cover some details that's needed.

129
00:10:34.52 --> 00:10:38.96
But he's flying out to this battalion which really was having a hard time.

130
00:10:38.96 --> 00:10:43.88
And the guy brought him in, the general brought him in because they knew that that hackworth

131
00:10:43.88 --> 00:10:48.44
was hard-ass and that he was a good performer that he, if anyone could get this battalion

132
00:10:48.44 --> 00:10:49.60
turned around, it would be him.

133
00:10:49.60 --> 00:10:51.72
So they brought him out there.

134
00:10:51.72 --> 00:10:57.68
So now he flies out and this is his first impression of the base where he's heading.

135
00:10:57.68 --> 00:11:01.56
When I landed, I couldn't believe my eyes or nose.

136
00:11:01.56 --> 00:11:05.56
The whole base smelled of raw shit and rotting morale.

137
00:11:05.56 --> 00:11:08.36
Toilet paper blew across the chopper pad.

138
00:11:08.36 --> 00:11:13.32
Machine gun ammo was buried in the mud and troops wandered around like zombies.

139
00:11:13.32 --> 00:11:16.72
Their weapons gone red with rust.

140
00:11:16.72 --> 00:11:21.72
These were the sloppiest American soldiers I'd ever seen, a barn nun.

141
00:11:21.72 --> 00:11:28.92
Camped, unwashed, unshaven, their uniforms ragged and dirty, hippie beads dangling alongside

142
00:11:28.92 --> 00:11:36.52
their dog tags, their helmets covered with graffiti.

143
00:11:36.52 --> 00:11:42.68
Not exactly what you're looking for in a good square-to-way military organization.

144
00:11:42.68 --> 00:11:46.40
Now one of the guys that he brings in, he brings in one of his guys to be the senior

145
00:11:46.40 --> 00:11:53.52
enlisted there to be his command sergeant major and it's a guy named Robert Press.

146
00:11:53.52 --> 00:11:57.04
Here's what he says about Robert Press.

147
00:11:57.04 --> 00:12:00.92
We'd also serve together in the States as well as in Vietnam and our partnership went

148
00:12:00.92 --> 00:12:03.68
all the way back to the same unit during Korea.

149
00:12:03.68 --> 00:12:07.76
Lean and mean, press would be my new battalion sergeant major.

150
00:12:07.76 --> 00:12:13.000
The non-combs chief ass kicker and new role model.

151
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.32
You get a good impression of what that guy is like.

152
00:12:15.32 --> 00:12:21.56
This is a gunny highways scenario.

153
00:12:21.56 --> 00:12:26.60
Here's what Press had to say about the local, about the troops.

154
00:12:26.60 --> 00:12:27.92
This is from Press.

155
00:12:27.92 --> 00:12:32.60
I looked around and seen no one wearing helmets, no one carrying their weapons.

156
00:12:32.60 --> 00:12:37.08
Everybody in the CP, that's a command post, group was sleeping above ground.

157
00:12:37.08 --> 00:12:40.32
Even above ground means if they get bomb, they're going to get killed.

158
00:12:40.32 --> 00:12:42.44
I didn't see a fox hole anywhere.

159
00:12:42.44 --> 00:12:48.56
I saw this out fit stinks worse than we thought.

160
00:12:48.56 --> 00:12:55.28
That's their first impression going into this bad situation.

161
00:12:55.28 --> 00:12:57.000
Can these are drafties?

162
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.52
I got to keep reminding myself myself that too because the whole time I was in the military

163
00:13:01.52 --> 00:13:03.64
isn't all volunteer military.

164
00:13:03.64 --> 00:13:07.52
Sure you get some slackers and some knuckleheads, but at least people had volunteered at

165
00:13:07.52 --> 00:13:09.60
some point to be there.

166
00:13:09.60 --> 00:13:12.60
These people are being pulled against their...

167
00:13:12.60 --> 00:13:14.96
I think you're a better example of this than me.

168
00:13:14.96 --> 00:13:18.96
Echo, Echo, Imagine when you were 18 years old.

169
00:13:18.96 --> 00:13:21.28
I mean when I was 18 years old, I was already signed up.

170
00:13:21.28 --> 00:13:22.80
I was in.

171
00:13:22.80 --> 00:13:25.94
Imagine when you were 18 years old and then coming at you, where were you when you were

172
00:13:25.94 --> 00:13:28.40
18 in the University of Hawaii?

173
00:13:28.40 --> 00:13:30.40
Playing football.

174
00:13:30.40 --> 00:13:33.20
Now what if they came to you and said, hey, Echo?

175
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:35.40
You have to go in the military, you're going to Vietnam.

176
00:13:35.40 --> 00:13:37.08
How would you feel about that?

177
00:13:37.08 --> 00:13:38.08
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:13:38.08 --> 00:13:39.92
It'd be rough.

179
00:13:39.92 --> 00:13:44.52
And you as a discipline football player, that's an athlete.

180
00:13:44.52 --> 00:13:51.04
You're going to be 10 steps above someone that's out on the streets of hate, ashberry, smoke

181
00:13:51.04 --> 00:13:52.72
and dope.

182
00:13:52.72 --> 00:13:53.72
But that's where these people were.

183
00:13:53.72 --> 00:13:56.20
It's a cross section of America.

184
00:13:56.20 --> 00:14:01.40
So sure you would get some kids that were getting drafted from Iowa, a farm kid that's

185
00:14:01.40 --> 00:14:02.48
like, hey, it's my turn to fight.

186
00:14:02.48 --> 00:14:04.12
I'm going to go do it.

187
00:14:04.12 --> 00:14:10.72
And you're going to get every cross section.

188
00:14:10.72 --> 00:14:15.36
So first, when you just don't want to be there, then every word, like someone telling

189
00:14:15.36 --> 00:14:21.000
you what to do or something that you got to go do, man, everything, every little thing.

190
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.96
Yes, and you can't have that attitude.

191
00:14:22.96 --> 00:14:23.96
You have to shift that.

192
00:14:23.96 --> 00:14:27.68
When I went through Officer Cannon School, Officer Cannon School is like boot camp, but

193
00:14:27.68 --> 00:14:29.16
it's a little longer.

194
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:32.88
And I'd already been in the military for eight years when I went to Officer Cannon School.

195
00:14:32.88 --> 00:14:36.52
And you know, they're yelling at me about the way my underwear is folded and yelling at

196
00:14:36.52 --> 00:14:41.12
me about looking at my food, when I'm eating and yelling at me about my, about my socks

197
00:14:41.12 --> 00:14:43.04
not being rolled up right.

198
00:14:43.04 --> 00:14:47.76
So I'm a grown man, been in the seal teams for like eight years at this point.

199
00:14:47.76 --> 00:14:48.76
And this happened.

200
00:14:48.76 --> 00:14:49.76
And you know what I did?

201
00:14:49.76 --> 00:14:50.76
I loved it.

202
00:14:50.76 --> 00:14:51.76
I said, oh, really?

203
00:14:51.76 --> 00:14:54.68
My underwear is not measured four by four inches when it's folded up.

204
00:14:54.68 --> 00:14:56.96
I will crack that now and make it four by four inches.

205
00:14:56.96 --> 00:15:01.08
Yeah, because deep down, because you kind of recognize the value that this is, this is

206
00:15:01.08 --> 00:15:03.48
somehow valuable in my goal.

207
00:15:03.48 --> 00:15:06.96
But man, if you're against your will, and they're like, do this or whatever, I don't

208
00:15:06.96 --> 00:15:07.96
even want to be.

209
00:15:07.96 --> 00:15:11.24
You also, like, like, I made it into a game.

210
00:15:11.24 --> 00:15:15.32
I made it into a game that I played with my full intention of winning.

211
00:15:15.32 --> 00:15:16.32
Right.

212
00:15:16.32 --> 00:15:20.56
For instance, they make you yell everything at Officer Cannon School.

213
00:15:20.56 --> 00:15:24.44
You have to yell every word that you say with the Jones structures or where your friends

214
00:15:24.44 --> 00:15:27.24
or whoever, we are, it's not your friends, but with the other candidates, you had to yell

215
00:15:27.24 --> 00:15:28.24
everything.

216
00:15:28.24 --> 00:15:30.84
They call it a ballistic tone.

217
00:15:30.84 --> 00:15:34.76
And so I made everyone yell one, because I was the class president.

218
00:15:34.76 --> 00:15:38.92
I made everybody yell 100% of the time.

219
00:15:38.92 --> 00:15:44.76
So for instance, the upper classman had a little closet that they would sell food out of,

220
00:15:44.76 --> 00:15:48.60
you know, candy bars and sodas, right?

221
00:15:48.60 --> 00:15:51.08
And we had to line up if we wanted to buy something.

222
00:15:51.08 --> 00:15:56.84
So I told all my people, you know, when you go in there, you maintain your ballistic

223
00:15:56.84 --> 00:15:58.60
voice at all times.

224
00:15:58.60 --> 00:16:03.16
So they're, they're, so my whole class lines up and they're going in and everyone is yelling

225
00:16:03.16 --> 00:16:08.44
at the top of their lungs like, I will take one Coca-Cola and one Snickers bar, please

226
00:16:08.44 --> 00:16:09.64
star.

227
00:16:09.64 --> 00:16:14.60
And it took about 10 people going through and finally the upper classman came out and

228
00:16:14.60 --> 00:16:18.88
they said, hey, you guys, when you come in here, don't be ballistic.

229
00:16:18.88 --> 00:16:23.68
And of course, I said, request permission to speak.

230
00:16:23.68 --> 00:16:27.000
You guys are not maintaining the standard of Officer Cannon School.

231
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.04
We are supposed to maintain ballistic tone at all times.

232
00:16:32.04 --> 00:16:35.56
It made just were looking at me like they wanted to kill me, but they couldn't say anything

233
00:16:35.56 --> 00:16:37.36
because I was correct.

234
00:16:37.36 --> 00:16:38.72
So that's the kind of thing.

235
00:16:38.72 --> 00:16:41.32
And that was a victory for my class.

236
00:16:41.32 --> 00:16:42.88
You know, because that was the upper classman.

237
00:16:42.88 --> 00:16:47.48
I was like a cool victory for the class and everyone was all laughing and fired up, you know,

238
00:16:47.48 --> 00:16:54.20
like we're going to be so perfect that people are going to get angry with us.

239
00:16:54.20 --> 00:16:57.20
So that's what I did.

240
00:16:57.20 --> 00:17:00.40
Now going back to the book here, he kicks this one off.

241
00:17:00.40 --> 00:17:02.24
This is directly out of about phase two.

242
00:17:02.24 --> 00:17:09.68
And it's also, well, this one says, there are no bad troops just bad officers in the

243
00:17:09.68 --> 00:17:11.24
book Extreme Ownership by Lafin.

244
00:17:11.24 --> 00:17:14.96
I have a little chapter in there called No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders.

245
00:17:14.96 --> 00:17:16.12
So the same thing.

246
00:17:16.12 --> 00:17:21.60
And that action goes back to Napoleon who said, you know, no bad regiments, only bad

247
00:17:21.60 --> 00:17:24.96
kernels or something along those lines.

248
00:17:24.96 --> 00:17:29.36
So then he talks a little bit about the guy with those previously in command, a guy

249
00:17:29.36 --> 00:17:32.96
by the name of Colonel Lark, and that's a pseudonym.

250
00:17:32.96 --> 00:17:34.28
But here we go.

251
00:17:34.28 --> 00:17:39.56
After six months under Colonel Lark, the 4 to 39th had suffered the equivalent of nearly

252
00:17:39.56 --> 00:17:47.40
40% casualties without ever meeting a significant enemy force in open combat.

253
00:17:47.40 --> 00:17:55.20
So it's mortars, a booby traps and friendly fire had done most of the damage.

254
00:17:55.20 --> 00:17:58.64
That's the same thing in Iraq.

255
00:17:58.64 --> 00:18:01.12
That's what most people were facing in Iraq.

256
00:18:01.12 --> 00:18:05.64
Rockers, rockets, mortars, booby traps, which is IEDs, friendly fire.

257
00:18:05.64 --> 00:18:06.88
That's where you're getting most of your casualties.

258
00:18:06.88 --> 00:18:09.24
From course in Iraq, it was mostly IEDs.

259
00:18:09.24 --> 00:18:11.72
But then mortars, rockets, and then you get your gun fights.

260
00:18:11.72 --> 00:18:15.04
I don't, you know, blue on blue definitely makes up a section.

261
00:18:15.04 --> 00:18:17.08
Not a huge section.

262
00:18:17.08 --> 00:18:23.40
And, but of course obviously it's something that we experienced.

263
00:18:23.40 --> 00:18:29.60
Back to the book here, all armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark,

264
00:18:29.60 --> 00:18:33.88
sunsue road over 2,500 years ago.

265
00:18:33.88 --> 00:18:40.44
Low ground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disinventages for fighting.

266
00:18:40.44 --> 00:18:44.08
If you are careful of your men and camp on hard ground, your army will be free from

267
00:18:44.08 --> 00:18:49.60
disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.

268
00:18:49.60 --> 00:18:54.84
I don't think General Westmoreland or the US commanders running the war in Vietnam, new

269
00:18:54.84 --> 00:19:00.84
sunsue from sunny and share.

270
00:19:00.84 --> 00:19:04.76
Then here he talks about what the damaging effects were of being in the low ground.

271
00:19:04.76 --> 00:19:09.08
In just 48 hours and soaking jungle boots, foot rot set in.

272
00:19:09.08 --> 00:19:14.36
The ski to zap them with malaria, leaches sucked onto their balls and even updix and

273
00:19:14.36 --> 00:19:19.80
morale vaporized before Charlie fired one shot.

274
00:19:19.80 --> 00:19:21.84
Luckily we've covered Sunsue on here.

275
00:19:21.84 --> 00:19:27.52
So nobody that's listening to the podcast is ever going to be out there thinking about

276
00:19:27.52 --> 00:19:31.40
the basic principles that Sunsue taught.

277
00:19:31.40 --> 00:19:36.20
Most of the 439 soldiers knew that each time they took a step they risked the ugliest

278
00:19:36.20 --> 00:19:37.84
of wounds.

279
00:19:37.84 --> 00:19:42.52
The bullet makes a hole, a chunk of shrapnel may take off an arm.

280
00:19:42.52 --> 00:19:49.000
But a mine turns a soldier into a splatter, shrapnel punctured basket case.

281
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.24
Many troopers in the battalion had concluded that waging war consisted of crossing a field,

282
00:19:54.24 --> 00:19:59.68
hitting a mind, calling for a medic, patching up the wounded, getting a meta-vac, then moving

283
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:03.36
out again and hitting another mind.

284
00:20:03.36 --> 00:20:06.84
They also did the math and figured out that not many of them would be lucky enough to make

285
00:20:06.84 --> 00:20:10.36
it through 365 days it took to rotate home.

286
00:20:10.36 --> 00:20:14.48
It's a horrible view of war.

287
00:20:14.48 --> 00:20:15.48
You know what we're going to do?

288
00:20:15.48 --> 00:20:17.84
We're going to walk around in the bush until we hit a mind.

289
00:20:17.84 --> 00:20:18.84
Some of us are going to get blown up.

290
00:20:18.84 --> 00:20:21.56
We're going to call in the meta-vac, we're going to get them out of the best weekend if

291
00:20:21.56 --> 00:20:26.04
they're not dead and then we're going to keep walking until it happens again.

292
00:20:26.04 --> 00:20:29.08
Back to the book, the wounds were vicious.

293
00:20:29.08 --> 00:20:33.72
Young men blinded, legs and arms and dicks and balls ripped off.

294
00:20:33.72 --> 00:20:36.88
The bodies punctured with dozens of bleeding holes.

295
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:42.92
For the VC, mines and booby traps were economy of force weapons easy to deploy, cheap

296
00:20:42.92 --> 00:20:44.76
to produce.

297
00:20:44.76 --> 00:20:51.16
Besides causing heavy casualties, they produced a lot of psychological stress.

298
00:20:51.16 --> 00:20:56.44
Soldiers never knew when they would lose a foot, a leg, or a life.

299
00:20:56.44 --> 00:21:03.20
And the frustrating part was there were a few ways to fight back.

300
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:04.64
Because who are you going to fight against?

301
00:21:04.64 --> 00:21:06.48
The bomb goes off.

302
00:21:06.48 --> 00:21:07.48
There's no one there.

303
00:21:07.48 --> 00:21:14.08
It's victim-activated ID, which means you stepped on a pressure plate.

304
00:21:14.08 --> 00:21:16.64
Oh, you pulled a trip wire.

305
00:21:16.64 --> 00:21:18.28
Something that you did made it blow up.

306
00:21:18.28 --> 00:21:19.64
There's no one to fight against.

307
00:21:19.64 --> 00:21:22.80
No one to shoot back at.

308
00:21:22.80 --> 00:21:29.40
The tally of back to the book, the tally of needless death in the 439th was a well-established

309
00:21:29.40 --> 00:21:32.56
before Colonel Lark took command.

310
00:21:32.56 --> 00:21:37.96
Works immediate predecessor, a gung-hole lieutenant Colonel drove the troops like in

311
00:21:37.96 --> 00:21:42.52
durt's indentured servants.

312
00:21:42.52 --> 00:21:47.08
One steamy day, a company working its way across a rice paddy was plotting through several

313
00:21:47.08 --> 00:21:51.80
feet of water and muck while overhead in the command and control, chopper, the Colonel kept

314
00:21:51.80 --> 00:21:54.72
screaming faster, go faster.

315
00:21:54.72 --> 00:21:55.96
It was never going to happen.

316
00:21:55.96 --> 00:21:58.68
The troops were already moving at max speed.

317
00:21:58.68 --> 00:22:03.44
In a lather, the Colonel landed, jumping out of his bird, he sprinted to a paddy-dike

318
00:22:03.44 --> 00:22:06.52
and then lept on top of it to make his point.

319
00:22:06.52 --> 00:22:10.000
A supreme may-kong delta-no-no.

320
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.24
And when the almost instantaneous explosion blew him 20 feet in the air and he died immediately

321
00:22:15.24 --> 00:22:19.08
and needlessly, the ultimate ego trip.

322
00:22:19.08 --> 00:22:24.12
I was told the grunts cheered.

323
00:22:24.12 --> 00:22:30.60
So the reason I highlighted that is because when we start talking about hackworth and what

324
00:22:30.60 --> 00:22:36.12
he does, you're going to see that he's going to, like the terms he uses here is gung-hole

325
00:22:36.12 --> 00:22:38.44
lieutenant drove the troops.

326
00:22:38.44 --> 00:22:43.84
You're going to hear hackworth doing the same thing, but there's a difference in the way

327
00:22:43.84 --> 00:22:45.44
that he does it.

328
00:22:45.44 --> 00:22:47.72
He understands what he's doing.

329
00:22:47.72 --> 00:22:53.24
He's not just doing it out of ego and out of pressing the guys for no particular reason.

330
00:22:53.24 --> 00:23:00.64
And then the other side of the spectrum, you get this guy, Lark, when Lark took command,

331
00:23:00.64 --> 00:23:05.22
he knew that he had to turn things around and he worked hard to do so, but with zero combat

332
00:23:05.22 --> 00:23:11.000
experience and not enough time with the troops, his good intentions meant less than nothing.

333
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.48
Even the basics were ignored.

334
00:23:13.48 --> 00:23:17.76
He wore an army-green baseball cap instead of a steel pot.

335
00:23:17.76 --> 00:23:19.56
Really cool.

336
00:23:19.56 --> 00:23:23.36
Except that the troops who followed his model and neglected their helmets wound up in

337
00:23:23.36 --> 00:23:29.96
Doc Holley's surgery with their brains running down their necks.

338
00:23:29.96 --> 00:23:37.44
He was a, he was into good guy, fratizing to build morale, a well-intentioned notion, but

339
00:23:37.44 --> 00:23:39.80
it made for bad news in the field.

340
00:23:39.80 --> 00:23:41.24
So you see the two extremes.

341
00:23:41.24 --> 00:23:45.92
You get the super hard core guy that's just a maniac pushing everyone hard.

342
00:23:45.92 --> 00:23:47.28
You must do what I say.

343
00:23:47.28 --> 00:23:50.72
And then the next guy comes in, he's on the other end of the spectrum.

344
00:23:50.72 --> 00:23:52.32
Hey, I'm everybody's body.

345
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:54.04
Let's, you know, don't worry, I'm wearing a helmet.

346
00:23:54.04 --> 00:24:00.52
Hey, I know that thing's uncomfortable.

347
00:24:00.52 --> 00:24:08.04
Lark sent his A company on a three day sweep of a wood blind, completely empty of VC.

348
00:24:08.04 --> 00:24:12.96
But a ho-che man wet dream of booby traps and mines.

349
00:24:12.96 --> 00:24:20.20
That was the day Sergeant Tom Aiken lost 17 of the 29 in his batoon without hearing

350
00:24:20.20 --> 00:24:24.72
a single shot.

351
00:24:24.72 --> 00:24:27.40
All we were doing was trip and booby traps.

352
00:24:27.40 --> 00:24:30.64
He recalls his voice trembling slightly.

353
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:34.12
There wasn't any enemy in there.

354
00:24:34.12 --> 00:24:35.84
No gooks at all.

355
00:24:35.84 --> 00:24:36.84
We knew it.

356
00:24:36.84 --> 00:24:43.52
Colonel Lark kept saying, sweep the wood blind, sweep the wood blind.

357
00:24:43.52 --> 00:24:48.24
More than 30 years later, Aiken made a list of the men in his batoon killed under Lark's

358
00:24:48.24 --> 00:24:50.52
command.

359
00:24:50.52 --> 00:24:54.76
When he finished writing it, his wife asked him, how could you remember all those names

360
00:24:54.76 --> 00:24:57.64
after all these years?

361
00:24:57.64 --> 00:25:00.68
His answer was simple.

362
00:25:00.68 --> 00:25:11.80
How could I forget them?

363
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:16.28
Now here's another incident that takes place just before hack worth the rives and takes

364
00:25:16.28 --> 00:25:18.68
over.

365
00:25:18.68 --> 00:25:25.24
The VC had planted an American made claymore mine alongside the road.

366
00:25:25.24 --> 00:25:31.48
The world blew up suddenly in smoke and fire, Evans recalls in dock, platoon medic,

367
00:25:31.48 --> 00:25:33.24
that's another book.

368
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:38.20
His blood and guts memoir of life with the 4.39th.

369
00:25:38.20 --> 00:25:45.56
A wall of supersonic steel balls blasted the passengers, shredding metal and flesh.

370
00:25:45.56 --> 00:25:52.20
From the bush, rockets swish down, lifting the Jeep and trailer up into an expanding fireball

371
00:25:52.20 --> 00:25:56.68
that tossed mangled soldiers all over the road.

372
00:25:56.68 --> 00:26:03.84
Automatic gunfire stitched every square foot of the road as those few GIs still able to

373
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:08.88
make made a run for an adjacent water-filled ditch.

374
00:26:08.88 --> 00:26:14.36
Those left behind, screamed and wailed and cried out.

375
00:26:14.36 --> 00:26:18.72
They crawled and pulled themselves around in the middle of the road like crushed bugs with

376
00:26:18.72 --> 00:26:22.64
limbs and pieces of their bodies missing.

377
00:26:22.64 --> 00:26:29.16
Teddy Creech used his elbows to claw his way across the road like a mangled worm.

378
00:26:29.16 --> 00:26:32.84
His hands were mutilated beyond recognition.

379
00:26:32.84 --> 00:26:39.16
His leg had been severed from the hip, except for a tether of bloody skin and flesh.

380
00:26:39.16 --> 00:26:46.12
The jagged end of the detached bone kept digging into the road and sticking him in place.

381
00:26:46.12 --> 00:26:51.80
He fumbled out as knife and in the way that a trapped animal will not fizz on foot in order

382
00:26:51.80 --> 00:27:00.40
to escape, cut himself free of his own leg.

383
00:27:00.40 --> 00:27:04.56
Richard Fortay lay with a bullet hole in his belly.

384
00:27:04.56 --> 00:27:08.44
His bloated gut signaled heavy internal bleeding.

385
00:27:08.44 --> 00:27:12.56
His face was the color of old ivory and that's something I've seen before where someone's

386
00:27:12.56 --> 00:27:14.56
gut shot.

387
00:27:14.56 --> 00:27:18.08
There's not a blood of blood coming out of him, but you can see their stomach starts

388
00:27:18.08 --> 00:27:21.12
to fill up because they're internally bleeding and they turn super pale because it's

389
00:27:21.12 --> 00:27:24.000
like they're bleeding out, but they're bleeding inside of their own stomach and it's

390
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.48
really obvious what's happening to him.

391
00:27:28.48 --> 00:27:29.88
Back to the book, it's all right.

392
00:27:29.88 --> 00:27:30.88
I'm okay.

393
00:27:30.88 --> 00:27:31.88
Doc.

394
00:27:31.88 --> 00:27:32.88
He groaned.

395
00:27:32.88 --> 00:27:33.88
Doc.

396
00:27:33.88 --> 00:27:34.88
The others.

397
00:27:34.88 --> 00:27:36.28
They need you.

398
00:27:36.28 --> 00:27:39.36
Go help my buddies, Doc.

399
00:27:39.36 --> 00:27:42.80
Where did the army get such men, Evans wondered?

400
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:48.44
Thinking of others when they themselves were dying.

401
00:27:48.44 --> 00:27:51.16
And what did they get in return?

402
00:27:51.16 --> 00:27:53.28
The VC picked us off one by one.

403
00:27:53.28 --> 00:27:57.76
He recalls one by one day after day.

404
00:27:57.76 --> 00:28:04.32
The 439th was helpless and demoralized against a superior army of ghosts that could

405
00:28:04.32 --> 00:28:11.76
do to us what it wished.

406
00:28:11.76 --> 00:28:19.76
So that's the situation that the 439th was in.

407
00:28:19.76 --> 00:28:21.84
Just an absolute disaster.

408
00:28:21.84 --> 00:28:26.88
Then you can imagine what the morale is like day after day you're going out as we just

409
00:28:26.88 --> 00:28:34.48
said, going out, walking through the bush just in order to get blown up.

410
00:28:34.48 --> 00:28:44.12
So that is when hackworth comes in to take over and hears the situation when he comes

411
00:28:44.12 --> 00:28:47.20
to take command.

412
00:28:47.20 --> 00:28:52.36
A scraggly bunch of battalion soldiers assembled for the change of command ceremony.

413
00:28:52.36 --> 00:28:56.20
Undisciplined and disperated wondering what was going to happen to them next.

414
00:28:56.20 --> 00:29:02.72
They stood like characters in a police lineup where every participant was a perp.

415
00:29:02.72 --> 00:29:08.36
Silver blades gleaming in the sun, a flock of brightly-simonized, hewies dropped from the

416
00:29:08.36 --> 00:29:13.44
skies over dizzy, dizzy as the area where they're staying.

417
00:29:13.44 --> 00:29:19.38
One by one starched army brass with an entourage of photographers struttered across the

418
00:29:19.38 --> 00:29:22.64
LZ, General Yule, beating the way.

419
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:24.12
Their fatigues pressed.

420
00:29:24.12 --> 00:29:28.76
Their sleeves percisely rolled up above their elbows into four inch folds.

421
00:29:28.76 --> 00:29:31.84
Their shoes polished to parade ground perfection.

422
00:29:31.84 --> 00:29:38.96
To the grunts, they must have looked like aliens from outer space.

423
00:29:38.96 --> 00:29:45.74
I stood soldier straight and watched those from on high pay absolutely no attention to the

424
00:29:45.74 --> 00:29:47.60
assembled troops.

425
00:29:47.60 --> 00:29:51.68
The men from their battalion, their division.

426
00:29:51.68 --> 00:29:55.84
For them, the boys on the line were beside the point.

427
00:29:55.84 --> 00:29:58.84
More pawns to be ignored.

428
00:29:58.84 --> 00:30:02.12
They disgusted me.

429
00:30:02.12 --> 00:30:11.08
In the ninth division, the gap between the brass and the grunts looked unbridgeable.

430
00:30:11.08 --> 00:30:14.36
So if you remember, Hackworth was a grunt.

431
00:30:14.36 --> 00:30:15.68
He came isn't it?

432
00:30:15.68 --> 00:30:16.68
List a guy.

433
00:30:16.68 --> 00:30:21.84
He was a junior army person and he came up through the ranks.

434
00:30:21.84 --> 00:30:26.74
So when he sees this behavior of these senior leaders, which he already knows that they're

435
00:30:26.74 --> 00:30:31.90
back with miniature golf courses and pools, then now he sees them show up there in their

436
00:30:31.90 --> 00:30:32.90
starched camis.

437
00:30:32.90 --> 00:30:38.78
They're looking all perfect and they don't even pay attention to these troopers.

438
00:30:38.78 --> 00:30:40.82
Even if they were to say, look, you guys look like crap.

439
00:30:40.82 --> 00:30:41.98
What is wrong with you?

440
00:30:41.98 --> 00:30:42.98
Get it together.

441
00:30:42.98 --> 00:30:46.62
Even if they were to say that, at least it'd be recognition.

442
00:30:46.62 --> 00:30:54.22
But to just ignore them.

443
00:30:54.22 --> 00:31:00.66
So he takes over and he says time for shock therapy.

444
00:31:00.66 --> 00:31:07.10
As I planned, I fired the incompetent S3 that the operations officer and the heavy drop

445
00:31:07.10 --> 00:31:12.50
battalion sergeant on the spot and replaced them with bumstead and press.

446
00:31:12.50 --> 00:31:16.76
One of the guys I talked about earlier, press and bumsteads, one of Hackworth's other

447
00:31:16.76 --> 00:31:19.50
kind of prodigies.

448
00:31:19.50 --> 00:31:21.58
Thousands of other changes needed to be made.

449
00:31:21.58 --> 00:31:27.02
But I didn't want to bury the company commanders or our staff on the first day together.

450
00:31:27.02 --> 00:31:31.78
If I ordered all shortcomings squared away immediately, I'd have sent these leaders

451
00:31:31.78 --> 00:31:35.42
into overload, blown all their circuits.

452
00:31:35.42 --> 00:31:37.30
No one would have gotten anything right.

453
00:31:37.30 --> 00:31:41.26
So I approached this conversation from slackness to soldering the same way.

454
00:31:41.26 --> 00:31:45.42
I'd train a pup just a few tricks at a time.

455
00:31:45.42 --> 00:31:50.46
Starting now, starting now we're going to follow the two rule plan.

456
00:31:50.46 --> 00:31:55.34
I said, I'll tell you what the two new rules are and you make them happen.

457
00:31:55.34 --> 00:31:59.66
Once your troops have mastered the first two rules, we'll add two more and we'll keep doing

458
00:31:59.66 --> 00:32:01.74
that until we're square away.

459
00:32:01.74 --> 00:32:05.74
First we'll court crawl, then we'll walk and then we'll run.

460
00:32:05.74 --> 00:32:11.22
Just stay with me because we're going to run faster and faster every day.

461
00:32:11.22 --> 00:32:13.02
They shot me a prove it.

462
00:32:13.02 --> 00:32:15.74
Look.

463
00:32:15.74 --> 00:32:19.46
So you can see Hack is going into a little prioritize and execute.

464
00:32:19.46 --> 00:32:21.82
He knows that people can't, he's not going to change everything immediately.

465
00:32:21.82 --> 00:32:23.38
He's got to do it in steps.

466
00:32:23.38 --> 00:32:26.62
That's the same thing you do with any situation that you face.

467
00:32:26.62 --> 00:32:29.06
We got multiple problems that are that you're looking at.

468
00:32:29.06 --> 00:32:30.54
You can't change them all at once.

469
00:32:30.54 --> 00:32:31.66
You can't fix them all at once.

470
00:32:31.66 --> 00:32:37.38
You pick the biggest problems you start with those.

471
00:32:37.38 --> 00:32:44.02
And here he's starting to establish himself and his men and his leadership team as to what

472
00:32:44.02 --> 00:32:45.66
their attitude was with the troops.

473
00:32:45.66 --> 00:32:49.78
A few days later after finding a very small soldier who told me his feet were killing

474
00:32:49.78 --> 00:32:52.30
him because he couldn't get any boots to fit him.

475
00:32:52.30 --> 00:32:53.30
They were all too big.

476
00:32:53.30 --> 00:32:59.02
I had a little conversation with the good S4, S4 is the supply element in the military

477
00:32:59.02 --> 00:33:00.94
in the army.

478
00:33:00.94 --> 00:33:03.66
Hack went ballistic, Johnson recalls.

479
00:33:03.66 --> 00:33:07.46
He chewed out his chain of command from his squad leader to his company commander and then

480
00:33:07.46 --> 00:33:09.02
he got a hold of me.

481
00:33:09.02 --> 00:33:13.66
He made it very clear that I better get that man of pair of boots or all kinds of horrible

482
00:33:13.66 --> 00:33:15.54
things were going to happen to me.

483
00:33:15.54 --> 00:33:19.18
The army did not make a men's boot small enough to fit this little guy.

484
00:33:19.18 --> 00:33:23.62
We scavenge the country and found a pair of women's boots that fit the bill.

485
00:33:23.62 --> 00:33:28.58
This taught us all an important lesson that Hack cared for the lowest of soldiers and

486
00:33:28.58 --> 00:33:37.30
he expected his commanders and staff to damn well look after them.

487
00:33:37.30 --> 00:33:42.54
This is how Hack goes on a campaign to change people.

488
00:33:42.54 --> 00:33:47.98
The little things build up.

489
00:33:47.98 --> 00:33:49.46
Now he's continuing.

490
00:33:49.46 --> 00:33:51.30
He's starting to tighten things up more.

491
00:33:51.30 --> 00:33:56.66
I finished my first session with a set of orders that stunned the commanders.

492
00:33:56.66 --> 00:33:57.50
Here's the drill.

493
00:33:57.50 --> 00:34:00.66
I told them we're shrinking the perimeter tonight.

494
00:34:00.66 --> 00:34:03.30
I want you to recon your new positions.

495
00:34:03.30 --> 00:34:06.66
When it gets dark, each company will pull back.

496
00:34:06.66 --> 00:34:10.50
You'll maintain your old positions with half your force and by midnight I want those

497
00:34:10.50 --> 00:34:12.46
holes filled in.

498
00:34:12.46 --> 00:34:16.66
I want nothing left that the enemy can use, particularly holes that the VC can hop into

499
00:34:16.66 --> 00:34:18.78
if they attack.

500
00:34:18.78 --> 00:34:24.26
All your people will be at 100% stand to ready to fight the new positions by midnight.

501
00:34:24.26 --> 00:34:27.66
I expect total light and noise discipline.

502
00:34:27.66 --> 00:34:33.54
Remember, nothing happens other than reconning until after dark.

503
00:34:33.54 --> 00:34:37.78
You've got to always remember that the enemies out there in the bush watching our every

504
00:34:37.78 --> 00:34:38.78
move.

505
00:34:38.78 --> 00:34:44.94
And he's always looking for a weak spot to knock your cock stiff and close down the show.

506
00:34:44.94 --> 00:34:47.86
You call me at midnight from the new positions.

507
00:34:47.86 --> 00:34:48.86
Midnight.

508
00:34:48.86 --> 00:34:49.86
Understood?

509
00:34:49.86 --> 00:34:52.62
The commanders went out to brief their troops.

510
00:34:52.62 --> 00:34:56.70
My orders went down like an iron kite.

511
00:34:56.70 --> 00:34:59.46
Preparing a fighting position is hard, sweaty work.

512
00:34:59.46 --> 00:35:02.66
Moving a fighting position is even more of a bench because you have to fill in the old

513
00:35:02.66 --> 00:35:04.94
hole before digging in again.

514
00:35:04.94 --> 00:35:06.78
It sucks in any circumstances.

515
00:35:06.78 --> 00:35:12.86
They hated my guts.

516
00:35:12.86 --> 00:35:18.78
And now he does the same thing with the leadership element, which works in what's called

517
00:35:18.78 --> 00:35:20.98
the talk, the tactical operation center.

518
00:35:20.98 --> 00:35:26.22
He says, and all the talk personnel, regardless of rank, were ordered to dig in individual

519
00:35:26.22 --> 00:35:28.62
foxholes around it.

520
00:35:28.62 --> 00:35:31.22
They'd live there when not on duty.

521
00:35:31.22 --> 00:35:34.30
My talk order had a two-fold purpose.

522
00:35:34.30 --> 00:35:37.70
Having a bunkered command post made it much harder for Charlie to take out the battalion

523
00:35:37.70 --> 00:35:44.54
ops center with a one well-directed round, which remarkably, he had already done.

524
00:35:44.54 --> 00:35:49.10
And if Charlie hammered the battalion with him coming fire or penetrated our outer line,

525
00:35:49.10 --> 00:35:53.26
we'd have an inner perimeter of staff we need to hold off the enemy while we fought the

526
00:35:53.26 --> 00:35:56.30
good fight in calleding supporting fires.

527
00:35:56.30 --> 00:36:02.38
Plus, the staff would be setting a positive example for all the line soldiers.

528
00:36:02.38 --> 00:36:04.94
We'd live exactly like the grunts.

529
00:36:04.94 --> 00:36:09.54
We'd sleep on the ground like stone wall jacks and did during the civil war.

530
00:36:09.54 --> 00:36:13.70
No one would have a plushed deal anymore.

531
00:36:13.70 --> 00:36:18.78
Common theme we've heard that one before.

532
00:36:18.78 --> 00:36:24.06
Then that night, so after they pulled their perimeter back, and they've basically changed

533
00:36:24.06 --> 00:36:27.34
their positions to what the enemy saw during the day during the day, the enemy saw

534
00:36:27.34 --> 00:36:30.74
where they were once the ones who got dark, they moved to new positions, they dug

535
00:36:30.74 --> 00:36:35.98
in they filled in their old holes, night comes and guess what they get attacked.

536
00:36:35.98 --> 00:36:41.70
Mordor rounds, recoilless life rifle, rifle fire, machine gun fire, and RPG rounds screamed

537
00:36:41.70 --> 00:36:43.94
in, chum robbered circles.

538
00:36:43.94 --> 00:36:48.74
Then all hell broke loose, strobe lights, they had just become an SOP at Hacks commander's

539
00:36:48.74 --> 00:36:52.06
meeting that afternoon, flipped on around the perimeter.

540
00:36:52.06 --> 00:36:55.62
The VC were hitting us hard, but we were ready now.

541
00:36:55.62 --> 00:36:57.18
Wow, I thought.

542
00:36:57.18 --> 00:37:02.34
They close to this guy and you'll be all right.

543
00:37:02.34 --> 00:37:06.42
Then another guy that hack overheard as they're getting this attack and they survive

544
00:37:06.42 --> 00:37:09.74
it and they do well, no one gets injured.

545
00:37:09.74 --> 00:37:13.78
He hears a guy say he's a mean son of a bitch, but he knows what he's doing.

546
00:37:13.78 --> 00:37:19.54
Again, this is part of the campaign.

547
00:37:19.54 --> 00:37:24.54
Dawn back to the book, Dawn was breaking and pressed walked the perimeter.

548
00:37:24.54 --> 00:37:28.18
Some of the troops are saying that you have your shit together.

549
00:37:28.18 --> 00:37:29.58
He reported.

550
00:37:29.58 --> 00:37:31.98
They're talking about how you pulled them back.

551
00:37:31.98 --> 00:37:37.02
Maybe I'd made a few converts that night, but I knew I was a long way from convincing

552
00:37:37.02 --> 00:37:41.98
the grunts that they could hit Charlie Harder than he was hitting them.

553
00:37:41.98 --> 00:37:45.90
Over the next four weeks, I talked to every swing and dick in the battalion.

554
00:37:45.90 --> 00:37:50.06
I told all the soldiers, all the sergeants, all the loutonants and captains in each

555
00:37:50.06 --> 00:37:57.98
platoon and company, what was expected of them and why we were going to be the best.

556
00:37:57.98 --> 00:38:03.66
So just to reiterate what he just did, he's going around in personally talking to all

557
00:38:03.66 --> 00:38:08.38
the leadership and all the soldiers, everyone, personally talking to them all and telling

558
00:38:08.38 --> 00:38:15.86
them what was expected of them and why they were going to be the best.

559
00:38:15.86 --> 00:38:17.54
This stuff just doesn't happen.

560
00:38:17.54 --> 00:38:21.46
You have to make it happen when you're in a leadership position.

561
00:38:21.46 --> 00:38:22.46
Back to the book.

562
00:38:22.46 --> 00:38:26.50
When I spoke to the troops, I promised I'd take care of their butts and be right out

563
00:38:26.50 --> 00:38:28.98
there with them when things got hot.

564
00:38:28.98 --> 00:38:33.74
I wanted to get into their heads that by stealing a page from the enemy's book, we could

565
00:38:33.74 --> 00:38:41.38
take the war to Charlie rather than waiting for him to strike.

566
00:38:41.38 --> 00:38:43.10
Now he talks a little bit about the VC.

567
00:38:43.10 --> 00:38:46.54
He says the VC were very detailed planners.

568
00:38:46.54 --> 00:38:51.62
It's strict adherence to their plan was also their Achilles heel.

569
00:38:51.62 --> 00:38:58.62
They almost always stuck to this scenario even when things turned to shit.

570
00:38:58.62 --> 00:38:59.98
So that's great.

571
00:38:59.98 --> 00:39:00.98
You're a good planner.

572
00:39:00.98 --> 00:39:01.98
That's great.

573
00:39:01.98 --> 00:39:03.82
You came up with a really solid plan.

574
00:39:03.82 --> 00:39:09.90
But when things start going sideways and you maintain that plan, you don't make any adaptations.

575
00:39:09.90 --> 00:39:13.22
You're going to get crushed and that was he says the VC's biggest weakness.

576
00:39:13.22 --> 00:39:24.26
I also had all our leaders read a pamphlet of combat rules and tips from articles I'd

577
00:39:24.26 --> 00:39:28.94
written that I put together as the battalion combat leaders guide.

578
00:39:28.94 --> 00:39:36.34
I wanted them to get in their heads both how Charlie fought and how I fought and fought.

579
00:39:36.34 --> 00:39:40.70
I wanted to build an offensive team to make Charlie react to us and set a calling the

580
00:39:40.70 --> 00:39:43.70
shots as he was doing all over Vietnam.

581
00:39:43.70 --> 00:39:50.46
I stressed how we'd find him by being hardcore and agile using stealth and cunning and how

582
00:39:50.46 --> 00:39:55.58
we could turn his very own tactics against him.

583
00:39:55.58 --> 00:40:02.74
Then that's I breezed over this but the other things that he had all this people read

584
00:40:02.74 --> 00:40:09.82
was Mao's little red book which was the communist sort of manifesto about fighting.

585
00:40:09.82 --> 00:40:14.70
And then Vietnam primer which is another book that hack worth put together.

586
00:40:14.70 --> 00:40:20.82
So he'd have everybody who is educating the troops, who is educating the leadership.

587
00:40:20.82 --> 00:40:28.14
Not just on how he was going to do things but on how the enemy fought.

588
00:40:28.14 --> 00:40:33.42
And this is a rehash from about face but let's just go ahead and rehash it.

589
00:40:33.42 --> 00:40:39.74
I brought back saluting a sign of military discipline that had been swallowed up by the rice patty

590
00:40:39.74 --> 00:40:41.14
mud.

591
00:40:41.14 --> 00:40:42.98
Then I added a twist.

592
00:40:42.98 --> 00:40:47.58
When a soldier saluted I required him to sound off with a loud hardcore recondo

593
00:40:47.58 --> 00:40:53.86
sir to which the officer would reply no fucking slack.

594
00:40:53.86 --> 00:40:58.66
The salute discipline aside also built for unit pride.

595
00:40:58.66 --> 00:41:04.02
The name recondo, a combination of reconnaissance and infantry doboy came from the rugged

596
00:41:04.02 --> 00:41:09.78
hands on training the 101st airborne division practiced at Fort Campbell.

597
00:41:09.78 --> 00:41:14.18
Training modeled after the British commando in American Ranger courses.

598
00:41:14.18 --> 00:41:19.18
Hank Emerson had named the first brigade the recondo brigade to make the unit feel elite

599
00:41:19.18 --> 00:41:21.54
like an airborne outfit.

600
00:41:21.54 --> 00:41:27.86
Hey, chiking on this idea, I named the 439th the hardcore recondos.

601
00:41:27.86 --> 00:41:32.86
Rob pressed hired a machine shop and saw gone to make small black metal recondo arrowhead

602
00:41:32.86 --> 00:41:36.86
pins which the men quickly began wearing.

603
00:41:36.86 --> 00:41:41.74
We painted the recondo insignia on the sides of our helmets and on all of our vehicles

604
00:41:41.74 --> 00:41:47.10
just below the windshield along with a large white hardcore.

605
00:41:47.10 --> 00:41:51.78
We painted the same insignia on company and battalion signs at the fire bases and back

606
00:41:51.78 --> 00:41:55.62
at our rear area in Don Tam.

607
00:41:55.62 --> 00:42:01.14
We also had sharp-looking hardcore recondo stationary printed up and gave it to the troops

608
00:42:01.14 --> 00:42:06.86
and all outgoing male was stamped with the recondo logo.

609
00:42:06.86 --> 00:42:09.70
All of this said we're different.

610
00:42:09.70 --> 00:42:15.58
We're not just playing old infantry where the best hardcore recondos.

611
00:42:15.58 --> 00:42:21.06
We drove the point home that an infantry combat the team, the squad, platoon and company

612
00:42:21.06 --> 00:42:24.62
was the primary instrument and inspiration.

613
00:42:24.62 --> 00:42:32.70
We stressed pride in itself, pride in unit and never let a buddy down.

614
00:42:32.70 --> 00:42:37.70
Rifle company designations were changed from the conventional alpha, bravo, Charlie, and

615
00:42:37.70 --> 00:42:44.86
Delta to alert battle, claim more and dagger which went down as Mickey Mouse until the

616
00:42:44.86 --> 00:42:50.06
troops got into it and began to think it was very cool.

617
00:42:50.06 --> 00:43:01.50
Now that's something that I completely ripped off emulated stole from hack worth when I was

618
00:43:01.50 --> 00:43:08.86
a task unit commander and the designations for the task units are Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,

619
00:43:08.86 --> 00:43:10.86
Delta sometimes.

620
00:43:10.86 --> 00:43:14.30
Sometimes Delta used when I was in it was Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.

621
00:43:14.30 --> 00:43:19.30
And so obviously I said we're not going to be bravo, we were assigned the name Bravo, but

622
00:43:19.30 --> 00:43:25.90
we immediately changed that to bruiser.

623
00:43:25.90 --> 00:43:30.26
And then we lived that way.

624
00:43:30.26 --> 00:43:35.02
Back to the book, hardcore soldiers wouldn't look like bums anymore either.

625
00:43:35.02 --> 00:43:39.38
They'd shave every day where they're gear properly and always being camouflaged went

626
00:43:39.38 --> 00:43:41.30
on ops.

627
00:43:41.30 --> 00:43:47.78
And the leaders made it happen by setting the example and being hard but fair.

628
00:43:47.78 --> 00:43:53.70
This was all viewed as chicken shit at first and I was considered to quote Doc Holly,

629
00:43:53.70 --> 00:44:00.54
the original GI Joe LIFEER sent from hell to burn their hides with fire and brinstone.

630
00:44:00.54 --> 00:44:05.74
So if you don't know this, LIFEER, the term LIFEER in the military, especially during

631
00:44:05.74 --> 00:44:06.74
Vietnam.

632
00:44:06.74 --> 00:44:11.46
You know, that's the opposite of a draft, you know, a drafty that does just want to do

633
00:44:11.46 --> 00:44:15.30
his timing and get out the opposite of that is a LIFEER.

634
00:44:15.30 --> 00:44:19.70
Someone that's totally into it, someone that's totally gung-hone fired up and they call

635
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:24.58
him the original GI Joe LIFEER.

636
00:44:24.58 --> 00:44:31.94
As Claymore companies Jim Robertson put it in February, led her to his parents, our new

637
00:44:31.94 --> 00:44:37.54
Colonel is nuts, it would take a week to tell you all the nutty things he's done.

638
00:44:37.54 --> 00:44:39.34
So I'll make it short.

639
00:44:39.34 --> 00:44:43.74
Line companies are offering $1,600 for his dead body.

640
00:44:43.74 --> 00:44:51.62
He won't last long, he'll get zapped, he's stark-raving mad.

641
00:44:51.62 --> 00:44:53.34
Nobody like to hack.

642
00:44:53.34 --> 00:44:56.02
Alert companies Tom Aiken recalls.

643
00:44:56.02 --> 00:44:59.82
I remember the guys from B Company talking about we're going to kill the son of a bitch

644
00:44:59.82 --> 00:45:02.02
and we're going to put a bounty on him.

645
00:45:02.02 --> 00:45:06.22
And I'm telling you the truth if I've ever told him my life, I turned around and glance at

646
00:45:06.22 --> 00:45:13.66
one of them said, I wanted them and I said, I'll throw in the first $20.

647
00:45:13.66 --> 00:45:19.90
But each time they saluted, they gave themselves a little subconscious commercial brainwashing

648
00:45:19.90 --> 00:45:23.98
that they were hardcore and after a while I knew they'd begin to believe they were the

649
00:45:23.98 --> 00:45:26.66
meanest mothers in Vietnam.

650
00:45:26.66 --> 00:45:30.58
The men of soon to be hardcore battalion hadn't seen anything yet.

651
00:45:30.58 --> 00:45:37.26
Threats are no threats, I continue to issue them a daily basic brown shoe army ass kicking

652
00:45:37.26 --> 00:45:41.94
and titan both the discipline and standards more and more.

653
00:45:41.94 --> 00:45:46.58
Of all the many traits needed to survive and win on the battlefield discipline is number

654
00:45:46.58 --> 00:45:48.38
one.

655
00:45:48.38 --> 00:45:51.26
Without absolute discipline, you lose.

656
00:45:51.26 --> 00:46:00.54
And these guys still had virtually none.

657
00:46:00.54 --> 00:46:04.94
And again, I got to point out that the original, remember the original guy that was super

658
00:46:04.94 --> 00:46:12.14
hardcore and trying to impose this discipline, it's very similar to what Hacks do.

659
00:46:12.14 --> 00:46:13.74
Very similar.

660
00:46:13.74 --> 00:46:19.58
The difference being number one, he cares about that guys.

661
00:46:19.58 --> 00:46:21.18
And they just haven't seen that yet.

662
00:46:21.18 --> 00:46:27.94
They don't understand that the discipline that he's teaching them is going to keep them alive.

663
00:46:27.94 --> 00:46:32.06
And when they recognize that manly, he knows he's got to push that through that point.

664
00:46:32.06 --> 00:46:36.78
He's not making them do things just to make them do not, he's not using discipline

665
00:46:36.78 --> 00:46:40.82
just to be a forerterian and prove that he can make them do that's not his goal, it's not

666
00:46:40.82 --> 00:46:42.26
what he's doing.

667
00:46:42.26 --> 00:46:43.26
He truly is.

668
00:46:43.26 --> 00:46:47.70
He's the reason he's trying to impose discipline on them is to keep them alive because

669
00:46:47.70 --> 00:46:50.70
he cares about those guys.

670
00:46:50.70 --> 00:46:54.34
And he's going to take a little bit of time for them to recognize it, but once they recognize

671
00:46:54.34 --> 00:46:59.34
it, they're going to be on board.

672
00:46:59.34 --> 00:47:07.02
Here's what he told his battalion leaders, the leadership inside the battalion.

673
00:47:07.02 --> 00:47:11.14
If you take care of your soldiers, they'll take care of you.

674
00:47:11.14 --> 00:47:17.58
According to battle companies, Lieutenant Carl Olson and OCS drafty, who has sharp as a

675
00:47:17.58 --> 00:47:19.66
hints in custom knife.

676
00:47:19.66 --> 00:47:21.50
The rules were simple.

677
00:47:21.50 --> 00:47:26.94
Check weapons, check feet, show that you care and let the troops know if we get into

678
00:47:26.94 --> 00:47:28.54
deep shit.

679
00:47:28.54 --> 00:47:31.54
Help will be on the way.

680
00:47:31.54 --> 00:47:36.82
I used every second every day to train and instill discipline.

681
00:47:36.82 --> 00:47:41.54
Beginning with something as basic as making sure every man wore his steel pot and carried

682
00:47:41.54 --> 00:47:44.62
his weapons at all times.

683
00:47:44.62 --> 00:47:49.42
We trained in the fire base, we trained on the ambush patrol, we trained sweeping a large

684
00:47:49.42 --> 00:47:52.50
patch of jungle, we trained searching for Charlie.

685
00:47:52.50 --> 00:47:58.62
I stressed all the unit leaders that all of the drills must be executed over and over again

686
00:47:58.62 --> 00:48:01.38
until they become automatic.

687
00:48:01.38 --> 00:48:05.34
I wanted these soldiers to roll into a firing position or take counter ambush action

688
00:48:05.34 --> 00:48:07.90
even in their sleep.

689
00:48:07.90 --> 00:48:11.02
Close combat allows little time to think.

690
00:48:11.02 --> 00:48:19.38
Do it right and training and you'll do it right when the incoming slugs flash by.

691
00:48:19.38 --> 00:48:24.98
Training and discipline discipline and training.

692
00:48:24.98 --> 00:48:31.70
The men groaned and moaned, but sacrificing and suffering together gave them pride and

693
00:48:31.70 --> 00:48:41.30
taking all that crazy bastard good throw at us as Lieutenant taller described it.

694
00:48:41.30 --> 00:48:46.06
So now you're starting to get them unified a little bit just in fighting against the man.

695
00:48:46.06 --> 00:48:47.46
You know, against hack worth.

696
00:48:47.46 --> 00:48:57.18
That's very something that happens in boot camp or in officer candidates school.

697
00:48:57.18 --> 00:49:01.86
The drill instructor or the drill sergeant sort of becomes the enemy that you're fighting

698
00:49:01.86 --> 00:49:02.86
against.

699
00:49:02.86 --> 00:49:07.30
You want to beat them.

700
00:49:07.30 --> 00:49:08.90
You don't want them to find dirt.

701
00:49:08.90 --> 00:49:10.46
You want your room to be squared away.

702
00:49:10.46 --> 00:49:13.34
You want the platoon to be squared away.

703
00:49:13.34 --> 00:49:18.14
You start to unify as a team, but the only reason you're unifying as a team is because

704
00:49:18.14 --> 00:49:20.26
there's someone to unify against.

705
00:49:20.26 --> 00:49:21.26
And then a van.

706
00:49:21.26 --> 00:49:22.26
Kind of.

707
00:49:22.26 --> 00:49:23.26
Yeah.

708
00:49:23.26 --> 00:49:27.10
And then eventually you realize that he's doing it's the same thing that he taught.

709
00:49:27.10 --> 00:49:28.10
These being talked about here.

710
00:49:28.10 --> 00:49:32.18
Eventually you realize that he's doing this to make you a better person and make your

711
00:49:32.18 --> 00:49:36.62
units stronger.

712
00:49:36.62 --> 00:49:42.58
Hot chow routine underlark was now a blurred memory from softer days.

713
00:49:42.58 --> 00:49:49.46
My idea of looking after the troops is not to spoon feed them, but to make them as hard

714
00:49:49.46 --> 00:49:56.02
as forge steel deadly in their kill or be killed trade.

715
00:49:56.02 --> 00:50:02.14
Eating sea rations, everyone knew could easily, even everyone knew hot food could easily

716
00:50:02.14 --> 00:50:07.38
be flown in, made the point better than 10 lectures.

717
00:50:07.38 --> 00:50:09.98
The ways of the past were over that something I didn't talk about.

718
00:50:09.98 --> 00:50:14.42
Dark would have hot food delivered on a daily basis.

719
00:50:14.42 --> 00:50:17.42
And there's risk and there'd be convoys that would get blown up in backwards.

720
00:50:17.42 --> 00:50:18.42
No.

721
00:50:18.42 --> 00:50:22.02
We're going to eat field food.

722
00:50:22.02 --> 00:50:23.70
The ways of the past were over.

723
00:50:23.70 --> 00:50:26.98
Stay alert and stay alive.

724
00:50:26.98 --> 00:50:32.42
You can't make a unit proud by praising it and you can't make a soldier proud by telling

725
00:50:32.42 --> 00:50:35.82
him how tough or good he is.

726
00:50:35.82 --> 00:50:38.10
That's superficial stuff.

727
00:50:38.10 --> 00:50:42.98
No pain, no gain they had to earn it.

728
00:50:42.98 --> 00:50:49.94
The standard was perfection and not just for the grunts, all the battalion support personnel,

729
00:50:49.94 --> 00:50:59.58
cooks, clerks, supply, drivers were to be soldiers first.

730
00:50:59.58 --> 00:51:00.98
Important stuff.

731
00:51:00.98 --> 00:51:05.14
Your unit doesn't become good just by you telling them that they're good.

732
00:51:05.14 --> 00:51:08.34
In fact, I always think that sets them back.

733
00:51:08.34 --> 00:51:09.34
You're good to go.

734
00:51:09.34 --> 00:51:10.34
Oh, you're doing great.

735
00:51:10.34 --> 00:51:12.54
But they get that little bit of satisfaction there.

736
00:51:12.54 --> 00:51:15.74
They get the satisfaction and their ego starts to think, I'm doing great.

737
00:51:15.74 --> 00:51:16.74
I'm doing great.

738
00:51:16.74 --> 00:51:17.74
Yeah.

739
00:51:17.74 --> 00:51:19.74
I don't need your training as hard.

740
00:51:19.74 --> 00:51:20.74
Right.

741
00:51:20.74 --> 00:51:22.10
Just for one day, you know, I'll take.

742
00:51:22.10 --> 00:51:23.10
I'm doing great.

743
00:51:23.10 --> 00:51:24.10
Yeah.

744
00:51:24.10 --> 00:51:26.46
And I'll take whatever little day off over there.

745
00:51:26.46 --> 00:51:30.74
Not good to plan.

746
00:51:30.74 --> 00:51:35.10
Regardless of my heavy schedule, I made sure to talk to every replacement to work.

747
00:51:35.10 --> 00:51:38.82
Welcome them to the hardcore before they went out to their units.

748
00:51:38.82 --> 00:51:42.06
At night, it had come back from operations late and Sergeant Major Press would have the

749
00:51:42.06 --> 00:51:44.38
replacements assembled and waiting.

750
00:51:44.38 --> 00:51:49.70
I stretched to each new man how important he was, how important was to follow the basic

751
00:51:49.70 --> 00:51:52.86
fundamentals of the infantrymen's trade.

752
00:51:52.86 --> 00:51:57.86
With the zeal of evangelists, all hardcore leaders drilled into new guys that when they

753
00:51:57.86 --> 00:52:02.38
joined the hardcore, they were joining a special brotherhood.

754
00:52:02.38 --> 00:52:11.30
I made the code for the these leaders simple and clear fight smart never be in a hurry.

755
00:52:11.30 --> 00:52:17.98
Lead from up front, set the examples, take care of the truth before you take care of yourself,

756
00:52:17.98 --> 00:52:20.74
keep the good commo going.

757
00:52:20.74 --> 00:52:27.10
Follow the Vietnam primer and the battalion combat leaders guide.

758
00:52:27.10 --> 00:52:29.26
That's it.

759
00:52:29.26 --> 00:52:35.74
We'll clear our instructions for his leadership.

760
00:52:35.74 --> 00:52:41.90
Many combat vets come to think they know what all and start taking shortcuts.

761
00:52:41.90 --> 00:52:46.18
They blow off the basics and neglect the little things that keep them alive because they

762
00:52:46.18 --> 00:52:52.06
get cocky or think it's better for their men's morale.

763
00:52:52.06 --> 00:52:57.82
They build a fire at dusk, smoke at night, walk on trails, don't carry their weapons,

764
00:52:57.82 --> 00:53:02.82
goof off on security, don't save their grenades or weapons, wear mosquito repellent on

765
00:53:02.82 --> 00:53:13.06
ambush or patrol, don't send out flank security on operations, shortcuts get you killed.

766
00:53:13.06 --> 00:53:17.62
The troops continued to bitch, but that changed when they saw the tough love was for

767
00:53:17.62 --> 00:53:19.78
real.

768
00:53:19.78 --> 00:53:24.50
One day, murder one of his leadership, one day, murder saw soldier wearing jungle boots

769
00:53:24.50 --> 00:53:29.14
with the toes worn out and immediately gave him his own a pair of his own, which happened

770
00:53:29.14 --> 00:53:30.82
to be the right size.

771
00:53:30.82 --> 00:53:35.30
The story spread like wildfire, finally someone cared.

772
00:53:35.30 --> 00:53:41.14
Not long afterward, murder went down in the CNC chopper to pick up a wounded soldier, a

773
00:53:41.14 --> 00:53:43.42
soldier wounded by a mine.

774
00:53:43.42 --> 00:53:48.62
As the medic slipped the wounded man on the chopper floor, he looked up at murder, grinned,

775
00:53:48.62 --> 00:54:04.82
saluted and said hardcore recondo sir, a new gung-ho attitude started to take hold.

776
00:54:04.82 --> 00:54:12.66
And that's the opening of the book and then you get into the combat that they went

777
00:54:12.66 --> 00:54:20.50
through, which was just a great, great stories and lessons you can learn from understanding

778
00:54:20.50 --> 00:54:27.62
the tactics that they use, the leadership, the pressure situations that they went through.

779
00:54:27.62 --> 00:54:37.06
And it's definitely a book that you should get and read, so you can absorb all that information.

780
00:54:37.06 --> 00:54:43.38
But I'm going to go to the end of the book to the after word.

781
00:54:43.38 --> 00:54:52.34
And it's something that hack or wrote basically right after he had got done, right after

782
00:54:52.34 --> 00:54:55.38
he got done being the battalion commander and he'd let him through a bunch of combat.

783
00:54:55.38 --> 00:55:05.22
He changed him from the hopeless to the hardcore to fan, fantastic display of leadership.

784
00:55:05.22 --> 00:55:11.46
And it's like the boat crew story in our book, when they changed the boat crew's from

785
00:55:11.46 --> 00:55:16.02
the boat crew's 16 is in the last place and all the races and boat crew's winning all the

786
00:55:16.02 --> 00:55:19.70
races and they just switched the leaders and all of a sudden boat crew's six starts winning

787
00:55:19.70 --> 00:55:20.70
the races.

788
00:55:20.70 --> 00:55:21.70
It's the same thing here.

789
00:55:21.70 --> 00:55:24.86
You have a battalion that's horrible, that's the one of the worst, that's got the worst record

790
00:55:24.86 --> 00:55:30.58
in Vietnam and sure enough you put in a new leader and they become the best battalion in

791
00:55:30.58 --> 00:55:32.62
Vietnam.

792
00:55:32.62 --> 00:55:38.46
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

793
00:55:38.46 --> 00:55:46.22
So from those from that experience he goes into this.

794
00:55:46.22 --> 00:55:49.14
I could never figure out Army logic.

795
00:55:49.14 --> 00:55:53.32
The command of an infantry or tank platoon is the most demanding and dangerous job in the

796
00:55:53.32 --> 00:55:58.46
armed forces, yet the army senior brass consistently failed to recognize this reality and

797
00:55:58.46 --> 00:56:03.62
to provide lieutenants with practical hands on training they need.

798
00:56:03.62 --> 00:56:08.78
As a result, platoons too frequently wind up under their command of under the command of the

799
00:56:08.78 --> 00:56:14.30
least qualified, most inexperienced leaders in the military.

800
00:56:14.30 --> 00:56:19.30
The average infantry lieutenant who joined hardcore in 1969 was simply not prepared to

801
00:56:19.30 --> 00:56:21.58
lead a rifle platoon.

802
00:56:21.58 --> 00:56:26.22
Because the army's approach to training had failed to ready him for the reality of combat

803
00:56:26.22 --> 00:56:31.62
Vietnam he was extremely weak in troop leading practical knowledge and small unit combat

804
00:56:31.62 --> 00:56:37.98
operations and was almost without actual field experience.

805
00:56:37.98 --> 00:56:45.06
The old saying good judgment comes from experience and experience disgained from bad judgment

806
00:56:45.06 --> 00:56:48.70
was certainly applicable in the hardcore.

807
00:56:48.70 --> 00:56:53.26
And this is something that if you're a leader in a leadership position you have to let your

808
00:56:53.26 --> 00:56:57.50
subordinates lead and you have to let them exercise their judgment and you've got to let

809
00:56:57.50 --> 00:57:00.90
them see the consequences of bad judgment.

810
00:57:00.90 --> 00:57:06.50
If you don't they're never going to learn.

811
00:57:06.50 --> 00:57:12.02
Back to the book, besides technical and tactical incompetence the next biggest shortcomings

812
00:57:12.02 --> 00:57:17.46
of new infantry leader replacements were a failure to be demanding and a reluctance to ensure

813
00:57:17.46 --> 00:57:23.90
that their men carried out the basics that would keep them alive on the battlefield.

814
00:57:23.90 --> 00:57:25.74
Lack of discipline.

815
00:57:25.74 --> 00:57:30.50
One of the reasons for these deficiencies was that many of the social values were diametrically

816
00:57:30.50 --> 00:57:34.86
opposed to what's expected of a combat leader.

817
00:57:34.86 --> 00:57:40.98
To take a single case in point I had to constantly deal with a civilian instilled value

818
00:57:40.98 --> 00:57:49.82
that drastically conflicts with the combat leadership principle, popularity.

819
00:57:49.82 --> 00:57:54.86
By the time these young men entered the army they'd been brainwashed for at least 20 years

820
00:57:54.86 --> 00:57:58.58
about the importance of being a nice guy.

821
00:57:58.58 --> 00:58:04.62
After four years of college, ROTC, military academy training or about a year of basic infantry

822
00:58:04.62 --> 00:58:09.34
and OCS they were supposed to be well-prepared meters who always placed the welfare of

823
00:58:09.34 --> 00:58:12.54
their troops just below the accomplishment of the mission.

824
00:58:12.54 --> 00:58:13.54
Wrong.

825
00:58:13.54 --> 00:58:19.86
The average new lieutenant who joined the hardcore had an almost Pavlovian instinct for being

826
00:58:19.86 --> 00:58:21.38
popular.

827
00:58:21.38 --> 00:58:28.46
So the definition of welfare was up for grabs because he had to be a good guy.

828
00:58:28.46 --> 00:58:34.22
He'd become a joiner instead of an enforcer instead of a leader.

829
00:58:34.22 --> 00:58:36.62
Become part of the pack.

830
00:58:36.62 --> 00:58:41.82
Be to step up and be a leader.

831
00:58:41.82 --> 00:58:49.26
In Vietnam, good guys let their people smoke at night and take portable radios to the field.

832
00:58:49.26 --> 00:58:53.98
Good guys allowed night ambushes to be set up in abandoned hooches so they wouldn't get

833
00:58:53.98 --> 00:58:59.74
wet and left only one guard by the door so everyone else could get a good night's rest.

834
00:58:59.74 --> 00:59:04.54
They let their men leave their boots on for several days and didn't inspect their feet resulting

835
00:59:04.54 --> 00:59:06.58
in immersion foot.

836
00:59:06.58 --> 00:59:11.14
They didn't make sure their men kept their weapons and magazines perfectly clean or protected

837
00:59:11.14 --> 00:59:15.02
themselves against mosquitoes or took their required material.

838
00:59:15.02 --> 00:59:17.46
Malaria pills.

839
00:59:17.46 --> 00:59:26.54
Good guy lieutenant ended up killing their men with kindness.

840
00:59:26.54 --> 00:59:29.38
And you gotta ask yourself.

841
00:59:29.38 --> 00:59:32.30
I mean this is, you know, we're talking about combat here but if you're in a leadership

842
00:59:32.30 --> 00:59:38.94
position in a business and you're not helping your troops by enforcing, by teaching,

843
00:59:38.94 --> 00:59:41.14
by holding the line, by disciplining them.

844
00:59:41.14 --> 00:59:45.66
If you're in charge of the group of people and you're not doing that, they're not going

845
00:59:45.66 --> 00:59:48.42
to perform the way they're supposed to perform.

846
00:59:48.42 --> 00:59:51.26
They're not going to, then that means your business isn't going to perform the way your

847
00:59:51.26 --> 00:59:52.90
business is supposed to perform.

848
00:59:52.90 --> 00:59:55.42
That means your business is going to go down.

849
00:59:55.42 --> 00:59:58.50
So you're actually going to take the job away from the person you're not going to be able

850
00:59:58.50 --> 01:00:00.26
to afford to pay him anymore.

851
01:00:00.26 --> 01:00:03.54
So because you didn't help the line because you want to be nice because you want to be

852
01:00:03.54 --> 01:00:09.26
a good guy, you're actually doing the worst thing for them.

853
01:00:09.26 --> 01:00:10.82
You're killing them with kindness.

854
01:00:10.82 --> 01:00:15.42
Is that kind of like how you said, I'm talking about your kids, if I'm helping them

855
01:00:15.42 --> 01:00:16.42
on the other side.

856
01:00:16.42 --> 01:00:17.78
If I'm helping them, I'm hurting them.

857
01:00:17.78 --> 01:00:19.58
That's very similar.

858
01:00:19.58 --> 01:00:23.30
Because if you're letting your, let's say you got sales people and you say, oh, you know,

859
01:00:23.30 --> 01:00:26.26
what don't worry about making some phone calls today, you know what, I don't want to

860
01:00:26.26 --> 01:00:27.58
push you too hard.

861
01:00:27.58 --> 01:00:29.26
Would you rather just go for lunch with me?

862
01:00:29.26 --> 01:00:30.26
Would that be nice?

863
01:00:30.26 --> 01:00:31.26
Would that make me a good guy?

864
01:00:31.26 --> 01:00:33.38
What should, what should you be doing if you're a good leader?

865
01:00:33.38 --> 01:00:35.34
Should we say, look, get on the phone.

866
01:00:35.34 --> 01:00:36.74
You got bills to pay.

867
01:00:36.74 --> 01:00:38.22
You got a mortgage to pay.

868
01:00:38.22 --> 01:00:39.82
You got kids you want to send a college.

869
01:00:39.82 --> 01:00:41.90
Get on the phone and start dialing.

870
01:00:41.90 --> 01:00:42.90
Make it happen.

871
01:00:42.90 --> 01:00:43.90
Let's go.

872
01:00:43.90 --> 01:00:45.22
Let's do this.

873
01:00:45.22 --> 01:00:46.78
Are you, are you a better leader if you do that?

874
01:00:46.78 --> 01:00:49.18
Or if you go on the ones that's going on to launch?

875
01:00:49.18 --> 01:00:50.78
I understand you're not in the mood.

876
01:00:50.78 --> 01:00:52.02
I know how that feels.

877
01:00:52.02 --> 01:00:54.62
Let's go eat lunch and have fun.

878
01:00:54.62 --> 01:00:55.62
Yeah.

879
01:00:55.62 --> 01:01:00.66
That's a great, a great twist on that term of killing people with kindness.

880
01:01:00.66 --> 01:01:03.22
Because I actually use that, you know, when someone's being a jerk, what should you

881
01:01:03.22 --> 01:01:04.22
do?

882
01:01:04.22 --> 01:01:06.26
I would say, oh, yeah, I know killing with kindness and I literally mean it.

883
01:01:06.26 --> 01:01:07.82
But this is a different way of doing it.

884
01:01:07.82 --> 01:01:08.82
Yeah, yeah.

885
01:01:08.82 --> 01:01:09.82
Obviously a whole different thing.

886
01:01:09.82 --> 01:01:11.38
It's just the same phrase.

887
01:01:11.38 --> 01:01:14.06
Yeah.

888
01:01:14.06 --> 01:01:18.10
While the back of the book, while the run of the Milutenants had a vague idea of what was

889
01:01:18.10 --> 01:01:23.50
required, he didn't have the experience or good sense to enforce the rules.

890
01:01:23.50 --> 01:01:27.66
And push came to shove, he preferred to turn his head the other way rather than come

891
01:01:27.66 --> 01:01:30.62
down hard on slackers.

892
01:01:30.62 --> 01:01:36.06
He overlook deficiencies such as dirty weapons and ammunition, improperly safe weapons

893
01:01:36.06 --> 01:01:41.30
and grenade, incorrect camouflage technique and the improper use of terrain, not using

894
01:01:41.30 --> 01:01:45.38
natural cover to provide protection from small arms fire.

895
01:01:45.38 --> 01:01:51.90
And without an ass kicking company, skipper or demanding NCO, the soldiers have its

896
01:01:51.90 --> 01:01:54.90
became sloppier and sloppier.

897
01:01:54.90 --> 01:01:56.66
Carelessness ruled.

898
01:01:56.66 --> 01:02:00.46
And of course, the result was casualties that could have been prevented had the lieutenant

899
01:02:00.46 --> 01:02:04.86
demanded the small things be done well.

900
01:02:04.86 --> 01:02:11.50
My own experience has been that soldiers in combat will do only what's required of them.

901
01:02:11.50 --> 01:02:17.34
Under week, nice guy leadership, they'll try to get away with everything they can, violate

902
01:02:17.34 --> 01:02:20.42
every basic rule in the book.

903
01:02:20.42 --> 01:02:26.26
At the same time, because they know they're wrong and that this behavior is placing their

904
01:02:26.26 --> 01:02:32.78
lives in jeopardy, they'll respond to the demands of a positive, ass kicking leader.

905
01:02:32.78 --> 01:02:37.50
The result will be fewer casualties in developing respect for the leader who cares enough

906
01:02:37.50 --> 01:02:41.18
for his men to make them do it right.

907
01:02:41.18 --> 01:02:42.58
So that's important to think about.

908
01:02:42.58 --> 01:02:46.18
This is not some people here this kind of talk that I'm saying and all of a sudden they

909
01:02:46.18 --> 01:02:51.26
want to turn into a super hyper aggressive person that's going berserk on everybody and

910
01:02:51.26 --> 01:02:59.70
trying to enforce every little order and every little discipline so hard that it breaks

911
01:02:59.70 --> 01:03:00.70
the guys down.

912
01:03:00.70 --> 01:03:03.10
And again, that's why I focused on that in the beginning.

913
01:03:03.10 --> 01:03:06.06
That guy that first guy was super hardcore, you could imagine that he would probably

914
01:03:06.06 --> 01:03:08.10
had people salute him in the field too.

915
01:03:08.10 --> 01:03:11.66
He probably, you know, was hey, you come to attention when I walk in the room.

916
01:03:11.66 --> 01:03:13.82
He was probably super hardcore on stuff.

917
01:03:13.82 --> 01:03:16.10
It was stuff that didn't matter.

918
01:03:16.10 --> 01:03:18.86
It wasn't the important stuff.

919
01:03:18.86 --> 01:03:24.42
And so there's a fine line and he makes a great, a great point here of pointing out that

920
01:03:24.42 --> 01:03:27.58
your troops, they know what's right.

921
01:03:27.58 --> 01:03:29.34
They know that you're there to help them.

922
01:03:29.34 --> 01:03:31.10
They're going to take the easiest way possible.

923
01:03:31.10 --> 01:03:35.58
But when you actually step up and lead and you explain to them why this is important

924
01:03:35.58 --> 01:03:39.10
you explain to them why this is why this is going to keep them alive and why it's going

925
01:03:39.10 --> 01:03:45.82
to make the company more successful, then you will actually get traction and you will get

926
01:03:45.82 --> 01:03:48.10
loyalty.

927
01:03:48.10 --> 01:03:51.90
Because when you keep these guys alive, they become loyalty when you get your sales person

928
01:03:51.90 --> 01:03:56.42
to sell more and do more, they're going to be loyal to you.

929
01:03:56.42 --> 01:04:02.66
When you get your manufacturing team to produce more and do it faster, because you push them

930
01:04:02.66 --> 01:04:04.74
a little bit harder, they're going to respect you.

931
01:04:04.74 --> 01:04:07.18
They're going to thank you.

932
01:04:07.18 --> 01:04:10.02
They're going to follow you.

933
01:04:10.02 --> 01:04:19.70
Yeah, it's real clear there when you show them some results, they'll, you know, they'll.

934
01:04:19.70 --> 01:04:21.86
Back to that, remember that movie, the boiler room I brought up.

935
01:04:21.86 --> 01:04:22.86
Yeah, yeah.

936
01:04:22.86 --> 01:04:26.66
So he said he'd mentioned something along those lines where he's like, show them a small

937
01:04:26.66 --> 01:04:29.70
return and they'll, I don't know, I don't forget what he said.

938
01:04:29.70 --> 01:04:32.94
They'll give you their firstborn or something like that.

939
01:04:32.94 --> 01:04:33.94
Same thing.

940
01:04:33.94 --> 01:04:39.06
Like, like, a little bit of results, like, like, heradicate, remember heradicate when

941
01:04:39.06 --> 01:04:40.06
he's making them.

942
01:04:40.06 --> 01:04:41.06
Yeah, wax on wax off.

943
01:04:41.06 --> 01:04:42.46
Yeah, yeah, he's making them do that.

944
01:04:42.46 --> 01:04:46.06
He's making them sand the floor, paint the fence, all this stuff.

945
01:04:46.06 --> 01:04:47.06
He's mad.

946
01:04:47.06 --> 01:04:51.34
But he starts off with a little bit of trust in them, you know, because he saw him, you know,

947
01:04:51.34 --> 01:04:52.50
he's a credit guy.

948
01:04:52.50 --> 01:04:57.86
And then when he saw the results, he was like, oh man, Mr. You know, Mr. Yagi, Mr.

949
01:04:57.86 --> 01:05:00.06
Miyagi, he was real loyal to him.

950
01:05:00.06 --> 01:05:01.06
Exactly.

951
01:05:01.06 --> 01:05:02.06
Same thing.

952
01:05:02.06 --> 01:05:10.42
Another, back to book, another serious shortcoming was the failure to teach leaders the

953
01:05:10.42 --> 01:05:14.38
importance of supervision and the techniques of supervising.

954
01:05:14.38 --> 01:05:19.46
The average small unit leader in 1969 seemed to take for granted that as a will would

955
01:05:19.46 --> 01:05:21.82
be done and that he didn't have to follow up.

956
01:05:21.82 --> 01:05:29.02
You got to follow up, you got to inspect.

957
01:05:29.02 --> 01:05:34.90
Especially in the beginning, you get the tone right, till people understand what it's about,

958
01:05:34.90 --> 01:05:39.90
what you're about as a leader.

959
01:05:39.90 --> 01:05:44.18
The nature of combat in the may-con, delta, and how we operate in the hardcore greatly

960
01:05:44.18 --> 01:05:49.54
extended this problem because small units normally operate on a widely decentralized basis

961
01:05:49.54 --> 01:05:51.98
in bitching terrain.

962
01:05:51.98 --> 01:05:55.58
This restricted regular visits from the company and battalion leaders prohibiting more

963
01:05:55.58 --> 01:06:01.54
experience senior officers and NCOs from checking the platoons and passing along tips of the

964
01:06:01.54 --> 01:06:03.22
trade.

965
01:06:03.22 --> 01:06:08.78
Without an experienced demanding leader, these carelessly lead platoons were headed for a

966
01:06:08.78 --> 01:06:11.02
world of hurt.

967
01:06:11.02 --> 01:06:19.10
The infrequency of heavy combat compared to World War II or Korea in 1951 and the prevalent

968
01:06:19.10 --> 01:06:27.54
all as cool attitude had a tendency to loll soldiers and leaders into a false sense of safety.

969
01:06:27.54 --> 01:06:34.86
The more alertness and security went slack, the greater the danger of an enemy attack became.

970
01:06:34.86 --> 01:06:43.02
We played right into the enemy's hands as Sunsu put it so well when the enemy is weak,

971
01:06:43.02 --> 01:06:45.02
attack.

972
01:06:45.02 --> 01:06:51.34
The World War II and Korea in 1951 and Korea, they were fighting so often that everyone knew

973
01:06:51.34 --> 01:06:53.86
they had to be square away.

974
01:06:53.86 --> 01:06:58.78
But here you might go some time, nothing happened yesterday, nothing happened the day before,

975
01:06:58.78 --> 01:07:02.42
nothing happened for the last week, maybe I don't need to clean my weapon tonight, maybe

976
01:07:02.42 --> 01:07:06.46
I don't need to dig into a new fighting position, maybe I don't need to wear my body

977
01:07:06.46 --> 01:07:08.46
armor.

978
01:07:08.46 --> 01:07:12.90
You do.

979
01:07:12.90 --> 01:07:18.66
I had to inculcate the hardcore leaders with the burning need to keep their people alert

980
01:07:18.66 --> 01:07:21.10
and never let down their guard.

981
01:07:21.10 --> 01:07:26.58
I had to instill in them the need to supervise the troops 24 hours a day to make sure

982
01:07:26.58 --> 01:07:28.58
that the fighting positions were adequate.

983
01:07:28.58 --> 01:07:33.42
Soldiers knew the mission, the situation, and where the LPs were, proper field sanitation

984
01:07:33.42 --> 01:07:34.90
was being practiced.

985
01:07:34.90 --> 01:07:39.98
All battlefield debris was destroyed to deny the enemy a source of supply.

986
01:07:39.98 --> 01:07:45.82
The troops were all sleeping undercover and protected from first round hits and fire support

987
01:07:45.82 --> 01:07:47.74
bases or camps.

988
01:07:47.74 --> 01:07:54.90
Subordinate leaders were heads up and demanding that their men were alert and tightly controlled.

989
01:07:54.90 --> 01:07:58.46
And never ending list of the little things.

990
01:07:58.46 --> 01:08:04.70
Rifle magazines cleaned, weapons test fired, grenades saved, LPs and claim was out, sectors

991
01:08:04.70 --> 01:08:10.82
of fire known salt tablets, malaria pills, jungle rot all monitored by the medics, stand

992
01:08:10.82 --> 01:08:14.86
toes frequently conducted.

993
01:08:14.86 --> 01:08:19.50
I had to get every leader to follow this adage.

994
01:08:19.50 --> 01:08:24.94
The best fertilizer in the world is the bosses' footsteps.

995
01:08:24.94 --> 01:08:27.82
They make things grow.

996
01:08:27.82 --> 01:08:32.02
So, that was just a giant list of all the little things.

997
01:08:32.02 --> 01:08:35.82
We talked about this when we talked about Cheshnea, but some of the lessons learned there

998
01:08:35.82 --> 01:08:42.06
and how it all started to fall apart for the Russians when the guys stopped shaving.

999
01:08:42.06 --> 01:08:44.50
This is the same thing that Hackworth has said.

1000
01:08:44.50 --> 01:08:47.66
You got a hold the line on the little things.

1001
01:08:47.66 --> 01:08:49.90
I will tell you this.

1002
01:08:49.90 --> 01:08:55.26
You need to hold the line and you need to hold the line by explaining to the troops why it's

1003
01:08:55.26 --> 01:08:56.26
important.

1004
01:08:56.26 --> 01:09:00.58
You can't expect just to say, hey, don't you clean your weapon.

1005
01:09:00.58 --> 01:09:04.78
Because if I'm not coming back for another week, you know that.

1006
01:09:04.78 --> 01:09:08.02
You're going to clean it on the sixth day one time.

1007
01:09:08.02 --> 01:09:12.14
What happens if you get contacted on the fifth day and your weapons not working now?

1008
01:09:12.14 --> 01:09:14.22
So I got to explain to you, hey, look, this is what's going on.

1009
01:09:14.22 --> 01:09:15.22
This is why it's important.

1010
01:09:15.22 --> 01:09:17.30
You can get contacted at any time.

1011
01:09:17.30 --> 01:09:19.38
You need to have your weapon ready at all time.

1012
01:09:19.38 --> 01:09:23.14
Most important thing to me, Echo, look, I want to take you home.

1013
01:09:23.14 --> 01:09:26.34
I want you to get home to your family.

1014
01:09:26.34 --> 01:09:30.62
And the only thing that's going to keep you alive in a firefight is this weapon you have

1015
01:09:30.62 --> 01:09:31.62
right here.

1016
01:09:31.62 --> 01:09:37.06
And although we may go two days, three days, five days, five weeks without getting in a

1017
01:09:37.06 --> 01:09:41.42
firefight, we don't know if it's going to happen in the next 30 seconds.

1018
01:09:41.42 --> 01:09:43.14
So you've got to keep that weapon ready.

1019
01:09:43.14 --> 01:09:44.54
So you're ready at the moment of truth.

1020
01:09:44.54 --> 01:09:46.62
You want to understand what I'm talking about?

1021
01:09:46.62 --> 01:09:51.74
That's when you explain people why they're doing what they're doing.

1022
01:09:51.74 --> 01:09:54.58
Because now you say, that's going to be back in the back of your head.

1023
01:09:54.58 --> 01:09:57.46
You're going to be thinking like, you know what?

1024
01:09:57.46 --> 01:09:59.14
Jock, tell me I better get this thing clean.

1025
01:09:59.14 --> 01:10:00.14
This is important.

1026
01:10:00.14 --> 01:10:03.18
If I want to stay alive, I need to keep this weapon clean.

1027
01:10:03.18 --> 01:10:04.18
Boom.

1028
01:10:04.18 --> 01:10:06.02
Guess what you're going to do, break out your field cleaning kit.

1029
01:10:06.02 --> 01:10:07.54
You're going to get it done.

1030
01:10:07.54 --> 01:10:09.54
Clean your room.

1031
01:10:09.54 --> 01:10:10.54
Why?

1032
01:10:10.54 --> 01:10:11.54
Because I said so.

1033
01:10:11.54 --> 01:10:12.54
Not going to work.

1034
01:10:12.54 --> 01:10:13.54
Not going to work.

1035
01:10:13.54 --> 01:10:14.54
Yeah.

1036
01:10:14.54 --> 01:10:16.54
Not going to work.

1037
01:10:16.54 --> 01:10:17.54
You know what?

1038
01:10:17.54 --> 01:10:20.94
It'll work for two days.

1039
01:10:20.94 --> 01:10:21.94
You know?

1040
01:10:21.94 --> 01:10:22.94
Maybe.

1041
01:10:22.94 --> 01:10:23.94
Maybe.

1042
01:10:23.94 --> 01:10:26.78
Yeah, you might do the bare minimum slack.

1043
01:10:26.78 --> 01:10:27.78
Yeah.

1044
01:10:27.78 --> 01:10:28.78
Just do a little bit.

1045
01:10:28.78 --> 01:10:30.46
But if you explain to people why?

1046
01:10:30.46 --> 01:10:33.66
I mean in your room, why you got to clean your room?

1047
01:10:33.66 --> 01:10:34.66
You know what?

1048
01:10:34.66 --> 01:10:36.26
I have guests coming over.

1049
01:10:36.26 --> 01:10:37.26
The R family.

1050
01:10:37.26 --> 01:10:39.34
It needs to be represented well.

1051
01:10:39.34 --> 01:10:43.06
If you're looking like a slob and I have one of my clients come by and they see that my

1052
01:10:43.06 --> 01:10:47.14
own kids can't be disciplined enough to clean their room.

1053
01:10:47.14 --> 01:10:50.18
And you think they're going to hire me to come straight now if they're company?

1054
01:10:50.18 --> 01:10:51.18
No.

1055
01:10:51.18 --> 01:10:53.18
Wrong answer.

1056
01:10:53.18 --> 01:10:54.18
Make sure teeth.

1057
01:10:54.18 --> 01:10:55.18
That's a big one.

1058
01:10:55.18 --> 01:10:56.18
Get out the rug.

1059
01:10:56.18 --> 01:10:58.18
Get out the vacuum and get that thing cleaned.

1060
01:10:58.18 --> 01:10:59.18
No.

1061
01:10:59.18 --> 01:11:01.18
You know when you tell you get to go brush your teeth when they're young.

1062
01:11:01.18 --> 01:11:02.18
You know.

1063
01:11:02.18 --> 01:11:03.18
Go brush your teeth.

1064
01:11:03.18 --> 01:11:04.18
They don't want to brush your teeth.

1065
01:11:04.18 --> 01:11:05.18
Like why?

1066
01:11:05.18 --> 01:11:06.18
You teeth are falling out.

1067
01:11:06.18 --> 01:11:07.18
Yeah.

1068
01:11:07.18 --> 01:11:10.18
You got to show them the nasty dental pictures.

1069
01:11:10.18 --> 01:11:13.18
People that don't brush their teeth and see how that turns out for them.

1070
01:11:13.18 --> 01:11:17.18
And then you tell them, you know, that's what you're going to look like.

1071
01:11:17.18 --> 01:11:21.18
When they're five years old, then they turn into like obsessive compulsive

1072
01:11:21.18 --> 01:11:22.18
teeth brushes.

1073
01:11:22.18 --> 01:11:23.18
So use caution.

1074
01:11:23.18 --> 01:11:29.18
Use the medium level of nasty looking teeth rot.

1075
01:11:29.18 --> 01:11:30.18
Just the medium level.

1076
01:11:30.18 --> 01:11:34.18
Don't find the crystal meth people that have their teeth falling out.

1077
01:11:34.18 --> 01:11:35.18
Don't show them that.

1078
01:11:35.18 --> 01:11:36.18
It's a little too extreme.

1079
01:11:36.18 --> 01:11:37.18
They'll brush their teeth too much.

1080
01:11:37.18 --> 01:11:40.18
Just find the cavity situations.

1081
01:11:40.18 --> 01:11:44.18
Or just tell them, you know, I don't know.

1082
01:11:44.18 --> 01:11:45.18
Just tell them what.

1083
01:11:45.18 --> 01:11:47.18
That their teeth are going to rot out.

1084
01:11:47.18 --> 01:11:48.18
Yeah.

1085
01:11:48.18 --> 01:11:49.18
The kids are visual.

1086
01:11:49.18 --> 01:11:50.18
Most of the time.

1087
01:11:50.18 --> 01:11:52.18
They want your teeth to rot out.

1088
01:11:52.18 --> 01:11:54.18
They'll say no.

1089
01:11:54.18 --> 01:11:55.18
Yeah.

1090
01:11:55.18 --> 01:11:56.18
Boom.

1091
01:11:56.18 --> 01:11:57.18
Maybe that could work.

1092
01:11:57.18 --> 01:12:01.18
We'll check out the dental hygienics here in a few years on the children's.

1093
01:12:01.18 --> 01:12:02.18
Yeah.

1094
01:12:02.18 --> 01:12:03.18
Make a decision.

1095
01:12:03.18 --> 01:12:05.18
Back to the book.

1096
01:12:05.18 --> 01:12:11.18
The principle was to learn so that we didn't keep making the same mistakes again and again.

1097
01:12:11.18 --> 01:12:17.18
To do this, we copied the VC technique of ruthlessly examining every operation.

1098
01:12:17.18 --> 01:12:24.18
And it's exercise that was a lot easier for the VC because they weren't as rigid about rank as we were.

1099
01:12:24.18 --> 01:12:31.68
When rank rules, people say yes or when they should say no fucking way.

1100
01:12:31.68 --> 01:12:36.18
I wanted to instill a particular sort of in-sabordination.

1101
01:12:36.18 --> 01:12:37.98
Don't get me wrong.

1102
01:12:37.98 --> 01:12:41.18
When I told the men to do something, I wanted it done.

1103
01:12:41.18 --> 01:12:50.18
I also wanted an atmosphere where no one would be afraid to sound off and speak the truth.

1104
01:12:50.18 --> 01:12:51.18
This is the dichotomy.

1105
01:12:51.18 --> 01:12:52.18
This is the balance.

1106
01:12:52.18 --> 01:12:55.18
You don't want an even hack worth.

1107
01:12:55.18 --> 01:12:57.18
As strict as he was and he wanted everyone to do all these.

1108
01:12:57.18 --> 01:12:58.18
Keep all these small things.

1109
01:12:58.18 --> 01:13:02.18
He wanted them to have a rebelliousness in them.

1110
01:13:02.18 --> 01:13:04.18
To say, you know what hack I think we're doing this wrong.

1111
01:13:04.18 --> 01:13:06.18
Or you know what hack I think that's the wrong way to do it.

1112
01:13:06.18 --> 01:13:10.18
Or you know what hack I think you should have pushed us over there or left us back over here.

1113
01:13:10.18 --> 01:13:12.18
Or we're not going to do this.

1114
01:13:12.18 --> 01:13:13.18
It's stupid.

1115
01:13:13.18 --> 01:13:15.18
That's what he wants.

1116
01:13:15.18 --> 01:13:19.18
And that's something that a lot of military people have a hard time with.

1117
01:13:19.18 --> 01:13:26.18
Because they get offended by someone of junior rank stepping up to them and saying,

1118
01:13:26.18 --> 01:13:27.18
Hey, bosses is wrong.

1119
01:13:27.18 --> 01:13:28.18
You can't have that attitude.

1120
01:13:28.18 --> 01:13:35.18
You've got to welcome and encourage people to check you and test you and question you.

1121
01:13:35.18 --> 01:13:36.18
That's what you want.

1122
01:13:36.18 --> 01:13:39.18
Yes, when they take it personal.

1123
01:13:39.18 --> 01:13:40.18
Oh, you.

1124
01:13:40.18 --> 01:13:41.18
That's pretty much it.

1125
01:13:41.18 --> 01:13:42.18
And they take it personally.

1126
01:13:42.18 --> 01:13:42.18
Yeah.

1127
01:13:42.18 --> 01:13:44.18
Like he stepped to me.

1128
01:13:44.18 --> 01:13:48.18
He didn't step to like the order or the, you know, the little scenario that I painted.

1129
01:13:48.18 --> 01:13:50.18
He stepped to me with it.

1130
01:13:50.18 --> 01:13:52.18
On acceptable ego.

1131
01:13:52.18 --> 01:13:52.18
Yeah.

1132
01:13:52.18 --> 01:13:54.18
Check your ego.

1133
01:13:54.18 --> 01:13:55.18
Back to the book.

1134
01:13:55.18 --> 01:13:58.18
After every operation, we'd sit down at the squad,

1135
01:13:58.18 --> 01:14:03.18
puttune in company level and work up a detailed critique that spared no harsh words.

1136
01:14:03.18 --> 01:14:07.18
It was Tom, you had your machine gun in the wrong firing position.

1137
01:14:07.18 --> 01:14:08.18
Bill, you're right.

1138
01:14:08.18 --> 01:14:10.18
You triggered the ambush early.

1139
01:14:10.18 --> 01:14:13.18
Hank, you go to help plant sucked.

1140
01:14:13.18 --> 01:14:15.18
War is so simple.

1141
01:14:15.18 --> 01:14:20.18
Yet the military school system tries to make it so damn complicated.

1142
01:14:20.18 --> 01:14:27.18
Probably they need to propagate a mystique in order to protect their turf.

1143
01:14:27.18 --> 01:14:32.18
But the bare bones bottom line to winning in battle is simply to sneak up on your

1144
01:14:32.18 --> 01:14:39.18
opponent and belt the shit out of him from behind as hard and quickly as you can before he figures out you're in the neighborhood.

1145
01:14:39.18 --> 01:14:42.18
And then beat it the hell out of there.

1146
01:14:42.18 --> 01:14:46.18
We should train our small units in not in the classroom,

1147
01:14:46.18 --> 01:14:53.18
but in the bush where warriors can be taught the gut fundamentals of infantry combat.

1148
01:14:53.18 --> 01:15:04.18
Rommel said, the best form of welfare for the troops is first class training.

1149
01:15:04.18 --> 01:15:09.18
First class training means hard work and sacrifice.

1150
01:15:09.18 --> 01:15:15.18
General Bruce Clark's adage, the more we sweat on the training field,

1151
01:15:15.18 --> 01:15:21.18
the less we bleed on the battlefield is one of followed ever since I was a teenager

1152
01:15:21.18 --> 01:15:25.18
and I'm convinced it keeps the casualty list short.

1153
01:15:25.18 --> 01:15:28.18
Everybody knows those two.

1154
01:15:28.18 --> 01:15:30.18
Does everybody follow them?

1155
01:15:30.18 --> 01:15:32.18
Not always.

1156
01:15:32.18 --> 01:15:34.18
Not always.

1157
01:15:34.18 --> 01:15:42.18
You see it with the military, with police, with fire, with sales people.

1158
01:15:42.18 --> 01:15:46.18
Are you putting your troops through realistic training?

1159
01:15:46.18 --> 01:15:50.18
That's hard and making them sweat and making them think are you doing that?

1160
01:15:50.18 --> 01:15:55.18
You need to.

1161
01:15:55.18 --> 01:16:00.18
Cadets and new leaders who show ineptitude and little leadership ability,

1162
01:16:00.18 --> 01:16:05.18
such as that walking atrocity, lieutenant William Callie of the Mylay massacre,

1163
01:16:05.18 --> 01:16:08.18
infamy should be immediately eliminated.

1164
01:16:08.18 --> 01:16:11.18
And I left this in here because this is an important part.

1165
01:16:11.18 --> 01:16:17.18
If William Callie, he's a guy that did horrible massacre in Vietnam,

1166
01:16:17.18 --> 01:16:20.18
murdered a bunch of civilians.

1167
01:16:20.18 --> 01:16:26.18
Callie was recycled three times at infantry OCS after being found wanting in leadership

1168
01:16:26.18 --> 01:16:32.18
before finally being commissioned in order to show a low attrition rate to higher head quarters.

1169
01:16:32.18 --> 01:16:35.18
A bad mistake with big consequences.

1170
01:16:35.18 --> 01:16:38.18
They had a guy that knew he was a weak leader.

1171
01:16:38.18 --> 01:16:45.18
He was showing weak leadership in his position to go through officer candidates school.

1172
01:16:45.18 --> 01:16:48.18
And what do they do? They recycle them three times.

1173
01:16:48.18 --> 01:16:51.18
So we failed three times. They keep pushing him through, keep pushing him through.

1174
01:16:51.18 --> 01:16:54.18
They finally make sure three goes out and commits a horrible atrocity.

1175
01:16:54.18 --> 01:16:58.18
Because he's a weak leader.

1176
01:16:58.18 --> 01:17:03.18
You cannot lower the standards.

1177
01:17:03.18 --> 01:17:10.18
More than any major enemy victory, the shame and horror of Mylay,

1178
01:17:10.18 --> 01:17:15.18
cause the American people to withdraw their support from the war effort.

1179
01:17:15.18 --> 01:17:20.18
Once they saw what Callie had wrought, they said enough is enough.

1180
01:17:24.18 --> 01:17:29.18
In small unit leaders, confidence like fear is contagious.

1181
01:17:29.18 --> 01:17:32.18
Troopers can feel it, see it, and smell it.

1182
01:17:32.18 --> 01:17:38.18
And it will rub off on shoulders from a platoon to a division as quickly as a good room or rumble's out of the latrine.

1183
01:17:38.18 --> 01:17:41.18
Confidence produces courage.

1184
01:17:41.18 --> 01:17:46.18
Most leaders or soldiers aren't born with a double basic load of guts.

1185
01:17:46.18 --> 01:17:53.18
The average leaders are scared as the next guy and their first or 100th firefight.

1186
01:17:53.18 --> 01:17:58.18
But if they are confident that they're tactically proficient, that their unit square to away,

1187
01:17:58.18 --> 01:18:02.18
team motivated by a strong sense of duty to accomplish the mission,

1188
01:18:02.18 --> 01:18:07.18
the courage that's needed to do what many will view as impossible will be there.

1189
01:18:07.18 --> 01:18:15.18
Mouths may go dry, guts may turn, and handshake, but when the slugs start snapping,

1190
01:18:15.18 --> 01:18:19.18
the prepared leader will be as cool on the outside as clenneased would.

1191
01:18:19.18 --> 01:18:23.18
And no one will know he's really scared out of his brain.

1192
01:18:25.18 --> 01:18:32.18
So if you're going into combat, and you've never been there, you're in a leadership position or not, you're nervous.

1193
01:18:32.18 --> 01:18:34.18
It's okay.

1194
01:18:34.18 --> 01:18:38.18
No big deal. Be nervous. Do your job.

1195
01:18:42.18 --> 01:18:47.18
Besides being one hell of a job leading men into battle is the ultimate responsibility.

1196
01:18:47.18 --> 01:18:54.18
On the battlefield decisions such as go left or go right or go straight ahead or made in a split second,

1197
01:18:54.18 --> 01:18:58.18
and right or wrong, good or bad people get killed.

1198
01:18:58.18 --> 01:19:04.18
Leaders carry the scars of those decisions for the rest of their lives.

1199
01:19:04.18 --> 01:19:10.18
Later, battle scenes play back deep into the night like an old movie.

1200
01:19:10.18 --> 01:19:18.18
Why didn't I wait? Why didn't I bring in more fire? Why didn't I go myself? Why didn't I go to the left?

1201
01:19:18.18 --> 01:19:24.18
Questions that will haunt the blooded combat leader until he's six feet under.

1202
01:19:24.18 --> 01:19:38.18
Good preparation, training, knowing your job and attention to detail will keep the nightmares and any casualties to a minimum.

1203
01:19:38.18 --> 01:19:46.18
To be a combat leader in the profession of arms is one of the most noble, most deadly jobs going.

1204
01:19:46.18 --> 01:19:51.18
It's rough and tough, and it's rewards are few.

1205
01:19:51.18 --> 01:19:56.18
But if at the end of the day the troops say he's a good man.

1206
01:19:56.18 --> 01:20:00.18
As opposed to he was a nice guy.

1207
01:20:00.18 --> 01:20:05.18
That's pretty much as good as it gets.

1208
01:20:05.18 --> 01:20:16.18
And I know that's something that I definitely felt.

1209
01:20:16.18 --> 01:20:26.18
Through my whole career, especially once the war started, was I always felt like everything I need to do everything I can to have these guys ready.

1210
01:20:26.18 --> 01:20:28.18
Everything I can to have these guys ready.

1211
01:20:28.18 --> 01:20:34.18
And when I was in charge of training and I was sending platoons overseas, I felt the same way.

1212
01:20:34.18 --> 01:20:40.18
This training is what they were relying on to keep them alive.

1213
01:20:40.18 --> 01:20:48.18
And do you sit there and look back and say, well, you know, why didn't I wait? Why didn't I bring more fire? Why didn't I go to myself?

1214
01:20:48.18 --> 01:20:51.18
Why didn't I go to the left? All those questions? Yeah.

1215
01:20:51.18 --> 01:20:56.18
You're going to have those questions, but those questions are quieter.

1216
01:20:56.18 --> 01:21:07.18
If you know that you did everything you can to prepare the guys for the situations that they're going into.

1217
01:21:07.18 --> 01:21:15.18
This book obviously, like most of the books we bring on here, I mean, there's just so many lessons to learn so much knowledge to gain.

1218
01:21:15.18 --> 01:21:22.18
And I mean, I wish I wish I would have learned them.

1219
01:21:22.18 --> 01:21:33.18
And you know, I think part of it, and you talked about this the other day, you were talking about how, when you know due to,

1220
01:21:33.18 --> 01:21:39.18
if you know due to, then you can, you have a certain context that you can learn due to due.

1221
01:21:39.18 --> 01:21:46.18
So if you know due to due already, you can make sense out of things. Like you can watch a YouTube video or you can read a book and you can look at it.

1222
01:21:46.18 --> 01:21:50.18
You can say, okay, I can do that. You can, you can apply it.

1223
01:21:50.18 --> 01:21:57.18
But if you have no experience with due to, it's very difficult just to look at a YouTube.

1224
01:21:57.18 --> 01:22:03.18
You can do it, but it's going to take a lot longer because you don't have the context of the moves.

1225
01:22:03.18 --> 01:22:07.18
And so you're going to need somebody to show you. You're going to need to do it.

1226
01:22:07.18 --> 01:22:11.18
Experience it yourself so that you can understand it.

1227
01:22:11.18 --> 01:22:26.18
And that's one of the things that I kind of think of why people like this podcast and that's sort of like what I have to offer is I've seen a lot of these things from a leadership perspective.

1228
01:22:26.18 --> 01:22:38.18
From being in platoons myself from growing up in the teams and then going into combat and then training platoons and then going into the corporate world and seeing what leadership does like there and the context of that.

1229
01:22:38.18 --> 01:22:49.18
And I think, I think one of the reasons that people like this is because I can just sort of help and put these things in the context a little bit better.

1230
01:22:49.18 --> 01:23:00.18
And then they can take them and put them into context and their own lives. But it's nice to have that little bit of help, but you can do it yourself. Everybody has been led.

1231
01:23:00.18 --> 01:23:03.18
You've been led by people.

1232
01:23:03.18 --> 01:23:11.18
Most people are have been in some kind of a leadership position, even if they're in charge of one of their person or five other people or a hundred other people.

1233
01:23:11.18 --> 01:23:26.18
But you've either led or you're being led. And so you do have the context to put these things in. But you just have to first of all do the work.

1234
01:23:26.18 --> 01:23:41.18
Get the books out, open them and read them and then when you read them try and read them from a perspective of balancing or not balancing.

1235
01:23:41.18 --> 01:23:47.18
But try and read them from the perspective of overlaying your own experiences on top of them.

1236
01:23:47.18 --> 01:23:58.18
And that will, that's what I do. I'm trying to kind of explain my process and what my process has been over the past 20 years when I see something I see a leadership situation.

1237
01:23:58.18 --> 01:24:05.18
I overlay my own experiences on top of it and compare and contrast to it. So that way I can learn something from it.

1238
01:24:05.18 --> 01:24:15.18
I just don't sit there and blindly watch a YouTube video about jiu-jitsu without putting context over it. So that's what you got to do with leadership in my opinion.

1239
01:24:15.18 --> 01:24:31.18
So great book, steal my soldiers' hearts by Colonel David Hackworth. And I think we can roll on to questions.

1240
01:24:31.18 --> 01:24:37.18
Before we get it all into the interwebs and the questions therein.

1241
01:24:37.18 --> 01:24:46.18
Why don't you talk about how the interwebs can actually support this podcast, jib-bo.

1242
01:24:46.18 --> 01:25:04.18
But ways you can support this podcast and at the same time support yourself, which is just an important in my opinion supplementation. On its supplements are the best ones by far. I only want to take.

1243
01:25:04.18 --> 01:25:19.18
I recommend alpha brain. I'm taking some alpha brain right there.

1244
01:25:19.18 --> 01:25:34.18
No, but sometimes you need delayed results. Anyway, where your bars as well, I would recommend. Do yourself that favor. Big favor. You can get 10% of your bars in your house.

1245
01:25:34.18 --> 01:25:51.18
You can get 10% of your bars in your house.

1246
01:25:51.18 --> 01:26:06.18
It's not disgustingly sweet.

1247
01:26:06.18 --> 01:26:34.18
It's not disgustingly sweet.

1248
01:26:34.18 --> 01:26:51.18
At times when you're about to do Amazon dot com shopping, go to jocopotcast.com first. Click on Amazon link. Then go to Amazon. Then do some shopping. Then Amazon will give us like a little percentage like a referral fee.

1249
01:26:51.18 --> 01:27:08.18
You buy what you actually need and you support the podcast.

1250
01:27:08.18 --> 01:27:23.18
I would say argue the best way.

1251
01:27:23.18 --> 01:27:38.18
There you go.

1252
01:27:38.18 --> 01:28:05.18
So yeah, this is a pretty obvious question. Standard operating precision. When you're talking about those with me, yes they exist in business, yes they exist in companies the way companies handle situations.

1253
01:28:05.18 --> 01:28:09.32
situations for me, I'm just going to bring it back to my roots in the military.

1254
01:28:09.32 --> 01:28:11.42
You have standard operating procedures for things.

1255
01:28:11.42 --> 01:28:16.90
You have standard operating procedures for many of the things that you do as a unit or

1256
01:28:16.90 --> 01:28:17.90
as a team.

1257
01:28:17.90 --> 01:28:20.74
You have the standard way of doing them.

1258
01:28:20.74 --> 01:28:24.78
And what's good is you drill and just like hack worth just talked about this.

1259
01:28:24.78 --> 01:28:28.54
You drill those standard operating procedures on you train.

1260
01:28:28.54 --> 01:28:29.70
He's talking about how you train.

1261
01:28:29.70 --> 01:28:30.70
You train this.

1262
01:28:30.70 --> 01:28:31.70
You train this.

1263
01:28:31.70 --> 01:28:34.58
You train the other thing and you keep training it until he says they're going to roll

1264
01:28:34.58 --> 01:28:40.02
out of bed and be able to react to a combat to an ambush.

1265
01:28:40.02 --> 01:28:42.94
That's you react with standard operating procedures.

1266
01:28:42.94 --> 01:28:44.58
So how do you get good at them?

1267
01:28:44.58 --> 01:28:46.30
You train them and you drill them.

1268
01:28:46.30 --> 01:28:50.42
Now, their same thing exists inside of grappling.

1269
01:28:50.42 --> 01:28:51.98
Someone starts to mount you.

1270
01:28:51.98 --> 01:28:55.42
You have a standard operating procedures to begin to escape them out.

1271
01:28:55.42 --> 01:28:57.26
Someone starts passing the guard.

1272
01:28:57.26 --> 01:28:58.66
You have or gets past the guard.

1273
01:28:58.66 --> 01:29:01.30
You have a standard operating procedure for the procedure that you're going to take to get

1274
01:29:01.30 --> 01:29:02.30
out of there.

1275
01:29:02.30 --> 01:29:03.30
You're going to get the underhook.

1276
01:29:03.30 --> 01:29:04.30
You're going to come up to a single.

1277
01:29:04.30 --> 01:29:08.74
On mounts, you're going to immediately put your elbows in tight.

1278
01:29:08.74 --> 01:29:10.90
Maybe try and shift your weight a little bit.

1279
01:29:10.90 --> 01:29:11.90
Shift their weight a little bit.

1280
01:29:11.90 --> 01:29:12.90
Get their knee light.

1281
01:29:12.90 --> 01:29:14.38
You're going to try and put them in the back and the half guard.

1282
01:29:14.38 --> 01:29:15.78
So these are all little stuff.

1283
01:29:15.78 --> 01:29:17.42
If someone starts to arm lock you, what are you going to do?

1284
01:29:17.42 --> 01:29:18.42
You're going to put your weight down on them.

1285
01:29:18.42 --> 01:29:20.18
If they're trying to arm you lock you from the guard.

1286
01:29:20.18 --> 01:29:22.90
You're going to have standard operating procedures.

1287
01:29:22.90 --> 01:29:26.46
Just like when you're on the battlefield, you want your team to have standard operating procedures

1288
01:29:26.46 --> 01:29:28.18
definitely in grappling.

1289
01:29:28.18 --> 01:29:30.54
You're going to have standard operating procedures as well that you're going to use.

1290
01:29:30.54 --> 01:29:34.10
Now, the way you get there is by doing

1291
01:29:34.10 --> 01:29:36.98
repetition, that's through drilling.

1292
01:29:36.98 --> 01:29:46.62
But in both situations, you don't want to have people so strict in drilling that they

1293
01:29:46.62 --> 01:29:49.54
lose the ability to think.

1294
01:29:49.54 --> 01:29:54.86
If you have a person that all they ever do is drill in GJ2, they actually won't be able

1295
01:29:54.86 --> 01:29:57.10
to apply it in real life.

1296
01:29:57.10 --> 01:30:01.34
When someone's trying to resist or when the technique isn't exactly what they expected

1297
01:30:01.34 --> 01:30:06.02
or it's with a person that has a different body size than what you're used to dealing with,

1298
01:30:06.02 --> 01:30:14.06
you have to encourage and you have to train for creativity and adaptation.

1299
01:30:14.06 --> 01:30:20.30
Again, something that the military, some times overlook, GJ2 people can sometimes overlook

1300
01:30:20.30 --> 01:30:24.30
at, you have to train for creativity and adaptation.

1301
01:30:24.30 --> 01:30:28.62
So if you're going to drill, don't just drill the way you think it's going to be drill

1302
01:30:28.62 --> 01:30:32.62
the strange variations that it could possibly be.

1303
01:30:32.62 --> 01:30:37.54
You know, you're not so good when it is, you fight using imposed restrictions on yourself.

1304
01:30:37.54 --> 01:30:42.94
So the only thing I'm going to submit you in is a Uma Plata.

1305
01:30:42.94 --> 01:30:47.94
So even if the GJ teams wide open, I got to give that up and throw them Uma Plata on you,

1306
01:30:47.94 --> 01:30:52.62
it's going to make me, it's going to force me to be creative to bring about the different

1307
01:30:52.62 --> 01:30:55.26
position that's not so obvious.

1308
01:30:55.26 --> 01:31:01.22
Rolling with different people better than you, worse than you, the same as you, bigger

1309
01:31:01.22 --> 01:31:07.74
than you, smaller than you, taller than you, shorter than you, every different variation.

1310
01:31:07.74 --> 01:31:10.82
When you work and standard operating procedures in the field, guess what?

1311
01:31:10.82 --> 01:31:15.46
You want to put yourselves in different positions, mix the squad up, mix the platoon up, put

1312
01:31:15.46 --> 01:31:19.02
guys in different locations, then you want to get contacted.

1313
01:31:19.02 --> 01:31:20.02
You know what?

1314
01:31:20.02 --> 01:31:21.70
Contact contact left?

1315
01:31:21.70 --> 01:31:24.02
Contact right contact rear those, the basics.

1316
01:31:24.02 --> 01:31:25.90
Where you're actually, you're contacted from.

1317
01:31:25.90 --> 01:31:30.86
You're going to get contacted from the right or rear and at the same time another guy

1318
01:31:30.86 --> 01:31:33.62
over on the left a little bit.

1319
01:31:33.62 --> 01:31:35.10
So that's what you want to drill.

1320
01:31:35.10 --> 01:31:38.98
You want to get that creativity working because things are not going to go as you

1321
01:31:38.98 --> 01:31:41.54
expect them to go.

1322
01:31:41.54 --> 01:31:45.74
So yes, standard operating procedures are important.

1323
01:31:45.74 --> 01:31:49.90
In anything that you do in a business, but in a business like you have, again, we've been

1324
01:31:49.90 --> 01:31:50.90
talking about sales today.

1325
01:31:50.90 --> 01:31:55.42
But you have a standard thing that customers are going to say when they call you and you

1326
01:31:55.42 --> 01:31:59.30
can drill through all the standard responses that you're going to give them.

1327
01:31:59.30 --> 01:32:03.62
But you also have to drill your people against a customer that you have no idea that's

1328
01:32:03.62 --> 01:32:07.30
acting crazy or that has a point that you've never dealt with before.

1329
01:32:07.30 --> 01:32:11.42
You know, any of those responses, that's what you want to deal with.

1330
01:32:11.42 --> 01:32:16.78
You're in any business, things are not always going to go perfect the way you want them

1331
01:32:16.78 --> 01:32:17.78
to go.

1332
01:32:17.78 --> 01:32:21.82
You've got to drill your leadership so they can handle the adaptation that they can

1333
01:32:21.82 --> 01:32:24.26
be creative and still figure out solutions.

1334
01:32:24.26 --> 01:32:29.06
Yeah, so it seems like get good at the SOP stuff.

1335
01:32:29.06 --> 01:32:34.22
Like I know in Gitu to just get really good at it at the SOP stuff.

1336
01:32:34.22 --> 01:32:42.42
But instead of practicing SOP in Gitu, just be mindful of SOP a lot all the time, be mindful

1337
01:32:42.42 --> 01:32:43.42
of it.

1338
01:32:43.42 --> 01:32:44.82
Yeah, and I had a guy on Twitter last the other day.

1339
01:32:44.82 --> 01:32:49.86
You know, hey, I'm in the basic, I can't make it to the beginners classes.

1340
01:32:49.86 --> 01:32:53.46
So I'm only in the advanced classes and now we're not drilling anything I'm not making

1341
01:32:53.46 --> 01:32:55.46
progress.

1342
01:32:55.46 --> 01:32:58.90
And he's saying, should I keep training?

1343
01:32:58.90 --> 01:33:00.06
Brother keep training.

1344
01:33:00.06 --> 01:33:01.06
Definitely keep training.

1345
01:33:01.06 --> 01:33:06.46
But I think more important is just, you don't have to, you can, you can find the time

1346
01:33:06.46 --> 01:33:07.46
to drill in your own.

1347
01:33:07.46 --> 01:33:08.46
I mean, it's a mountain escape.

1348
01:33:08.46 --> 01:33:11.70
Look it up on Google, look it up on YouTube, see the mountain escape.

1349
01:33:11.70 --> 01:33:16.82
That's the basic that you want to work on and then grab your girlfriend and say here, sit

1350
01:33:16.82 --> 01:33:17.82
on me like this.

1351
01:33:17.82 --> 01:33:19.62
I'm going to do some movements with my hips.

1352
01:33:19.62 --> 01:33:22.98
It might seem awkward at first, but I'm going to do it anyways, honey.

1353
01:33:22.98 --> 01:33:23.98
And then do it.

1354
01:33:23.98 --> 01:33:24.98
That's drilling, you know?

1355
01:33:24.98 --> 01:33:28.22
Or once you get to class, show up to class or stay class a little bit later.

1356
01:33:28.22 --> 01:33:30.02
Spend 10 minutes drilling the mountain escape.

1357
01:33:30.02 --> 01:33:32.38
10, spend five minutes doing arm locks.

1358
01:33:32.38 --> 01:33:33.38
That's it.

1359
01:33:33.38 --> 01:33:35.02
How many arm locks can you do in five minutes?

1360
01:33:35.02 --> 01:33:37.38
I mean, you can do enough to drill, trust me.

1361
01:33:37.38 --> 01:33:39.90
You don't need to drill for half an hour.

1362
01:33:39.90 --> 01:33:44.50
So just know the movements, learn the movements, and then just go and do a little bit

1363
01:33:44.50 --> 01:33:46.66
of drilling, and you'll get there.

1364
01:33:46.66 --> 01:33:50.38
But even if you didn't do that and you just rolled and you took the advanced class and

1365
01:33:50.38 --> 01:33:52.90
you learned the advanced moves, eventually you're going to figure out the other stuff,

1366
01:33:52.90 --> 01:33:53.90
too.

1367
01:33:53.90 --> 01:33:56.22
It's like being a mercenal language, you know?

1368
01:33:56.22 --> 01:33:59.86
Just because you went and got immersed in a kindergarten class doesn't mean you

1369
01:33:59.86 --> 01:34:07.22
would learn faster than if you got immersed in a real life college, you know, or open

1370
01:34:07.22 --> 01:34:09.42
just normal life situation.

1371
01:34:09.42 --> 01:34:10.42
Yeah.

1372
01:34:10.42 --> 01:34:11.42
Yeah.

1373
01:34:11.42 --> 01:34:12.42
It's true.

1374
01:34:12.42 --> 01:34:17.42
So if you get good at these, um, started operating procedures and you can mind them all

1375
01:34:17.42 --> 01:34:18.42
a time.

1376
01:34:18.42 --> 01:34:23.42
And at the same time, like how you're saying, you exercise your creativity, then you

1377
01:34:23.42 --> 01:34:28.82
can, you can stick to them, but at the same time, you can know when to break the rules

1378
01:34:28.82 --> 01:34:29.82
so to speak.

1379
01:34:29.82 --> 01:34:30.82
You know?

1380
01:34:30.82 --> 01:34:35.18
Well, Dean, but Dean is really good with some of the basic movements.

1381
01:34:35.18 --> 01:34:36.18
Yeah.

1382
01:34:36.18 --> 01:34:41.78
Like he's really, really good in them and he can almost force them.

1383
01:34:41.78 --> 01:34:46.90
Whereas Jeffy Glover, he's really good at the basics, too, but he's more in my mind.

1384
01:34:46.90 --> 01:34:49.70
He's more apt to do something creative.

1385
01:34:49.70 --> 01:34:55.78
Whereas Dean is like so good with the fundamentals that he doesn't even have to be creative

1386
01:34:55.78 --> 01:34:56.78
sometimes.

1387
01:34:56.78 --> 01:34:58.74
Of course, he is also very creative.

1388
01:34:58.74 --> 01:35:02.34
That's why he's, you know, done so well in the world.

1389
01:35:02.34 --> 01:35:04.38
But both of those guys have crazy.

1390
01:35:04.38 --> 01:35:08.98
I mean, any, in a John Dersdeen in Jeff, but any really good jujitsu players going to be

1391
01:35:08.98 --> 01:35:11.14
awesome at the basics.

1392
01:35:11.14 --> 01:35:12.58
And then they're going to be creative.

1393
01:35:12.58 --> 01:35:14.34
That's what makes the jujitsu champion.

1394
01:35:14.34 --> 01:35:15.34
Yep.

1395
01:35:15.34 --> 01:35:21.46
It's like, um, actually Jeff has this, this drill that he, he got crazy drill.

1396
01:35:21.46 --> 01:35:23.50
I think he just started up on the spot, too.

1397
01:35:23.50 --> 01:35:28.06
It seemed like he did, but I know, but it's, it's basically, he'll be like, he'll, he'll

1398
01:35:28.06 --> 01:35:29.06
yell out a position.

1399
01:35:29.06 --> 01:35:30.06
Then you got to get to that position.

1400
01:35:30.06 --> 01:35:34.14
And kind of not the fastest like, oh, the quickest you can do it physically.

1401
01:35:34.14 --> 01:35:36.66
It's more like the, with the least steps, you know.

1402
01:35:36.66 --> 01:35:39.86
So if you're like, hey, half guard, now do a knee bar.

1403
01:35:39.86 --> 01:35:41.10
Now do it or he'll say a submission.

1404
01:35:41.10 --> 01:35:42.82
He'll say a different position.

1405
01:35:42.82 --> 01:35:43.82
Right.

1406
01:35:43.82 --> 01:35:45.18
And then like half guard, now take his back.

1407
01:35:45.18 --> 01:35:49.26
Now, you know, and you have to, like, how do I take it guys back from half guard?

1408
01:35:49.26 --> 01:35:53.06
And you have to kind of, you know, so it exercises not only your creativity, but thinking

1409
01:35:53.06 --> 01:35:54.54
fast with this, you know?

1410
01:35:54.54 --> 01:35:58.62
So after a while, you start to be like, oh, I didn't know there was a knee bar from here

1411
01:35:58.62 --> 01:35:59.94
with only like two steps.

1412
01:35:59.94 --> 01:36:00.94
You know, that kind of thing.

1413
01:36:00.94 --> 01:36:02.70
I was like, dang, I really liked that drill.

1414
01:36:02.70 --> 01:36:07.58
And he was like, yeah, and Dean, one Dean Strowl's, Dean will have, Dean does these

1415
01:36:07.58 --> 01:36:08.58
same thing.

1416
01:36:08.58 --> 01:36:12.30
He'll just call out, but he'll call out like a leg, because it would be with leg positions.

1417
01:36:12.30 --> 01:36:13.30
Yeah.

1418
01:36:13.30 --> 01:36:18.38
He'll be like, you know, for 11, then outside, then, Cocacricle, he'll just go through

1419
01:36:18.38 --> 01:36:20.46
and we'll just sit there and do them.

1420
01:36:20.46 --> 01:36:23.26
And what's cool about it too is you get to learn like little defenses.

1421
01:36:23.26 --> 01:36:24.26
Oh, yeah.

1422
01:36:24.26 --> 01:36:25.86
Also, you're doing it in defending.

1423
01:36:25.86 --> 01:36:27.86
Not hard court defense, right?

1424
01:36:27.86 --> 01:36:29.30
But you're making that little adjustie.

1425
01:36:29.30 --> 01:36:30.30
Yeah, I'm making mine full.

1426
01:36:30.30 --> 01:36:31.30
Yes.

1427
01:36:31.30 --> 01:36:32.30
Yes.

1428
01:36:32.30 --> 01:36:37.30
So yes, SOPs learn them drill, but be creative.

1429
01:36:37.30 --> 01:36:38.30
Yeah.

1430
01:36:38.30 --> 01:36:39.30
Yeah.

1431
01:36:39.30 --> 01:36:42.06
Man, it seems like that's a 100% translation right there.

1432
01:36:42.06 --> 01:36:45.50
Like you know the kind of like, it is a 100% blow to the SOP.

1433
01:36:45.50 --> 01:36:46.50
Winning out.

1434
01:36:46.50 --> 01:36:47.50
You're in someone's garden.

1435
01:36:47.50 --> 01:36:48.50
He's all wild.

1436
01:36:48.50 --> 01:36:53.18
It's like, go to SOP, mind your base, mind your posture, mind your elbows or whatever.

1437
01:36:53.18 --> 01:36:55.30
There's like all these things that are winning out.

1438
01:36:55.30 --> 01:36:56.30
You do.

1439
01:36:56.30 --> 01:36:58.30
It is a 100%.

1440
01:36:58.30 --> 01:36:59.30
Translation.

1441
01:36:59.30 --> 01:37:00.30
Yeah.

1442
01:37:00.30 --> 01:37:01.30
It's a 100%.

1443
01:37:01.30 --> 01:37:02.30
Yeah, that's crazy.

1444
01:37:02.30 --> 01:37:03.30
Next question.

1445
01:37:03.30 --> 01:37:04.30
Jockel.

1446
01:37:04.30 --> 01:37:09.30
When does asking for input up and down the chain of command as discussed in episode

1447
01:37:09.30 --> 01:37:10.30
26?

1448
01:37:10.30 --> 01:37:14.70
Hinder the leaders of the ability to make timely decisions, especially when gaining the initiative

1449
01:37:14.70 --> 01:37:18.54
is critical.

1450
01:37:18.54 --> 01:37:26.54
So yeah, this is a question that I asked and I got to answer for you TJ who asked the question.

1451
01:37:26.54 --> 01:37:31.10
When you are, okay, so the situation is a little bit different.

1452
01:37:31.10 --> 01:37:35.66
If you're in an administrative situation or you're in a planning situation, meaning

1453
01:37:35.66 --> 01:37:41.90
neither one of those are restricted by time, then of course get the input.

1454
01:37:41.90 --> 01:37:47.30
And by getting the input, of course you're first of all, your plan becomes better because

1455
01:37:47.30 --> 01:37:48.62
you're getting input from people.

1456
01:37:48.62 --> 01:37:50.26
You have more brains working on it.

1457
01:37:50.26 --> 01:37:54.74
You also, when you get input, you're building a little bit of a relationship.

1458
01:37:54.74 --> 01:37:56.50
Your build in relationship.

1459
01:37:56.50 --> 01:38:00.62
What are relationships are based on trust?

1460
01:38:00.62 --> 01:38:04.50
And so trust is a requirement inside of leadership.

1461
01:38:04.50 --> 01:38:07.62
So that's what you want to do.

1462
01:38:07.62 --> 01:38:12.74
If you have the time and it's administrative scenario or you got the time to plan, then

1463
01:38:12.74 --> 01:38:16.22
just go ahead and take the time to plan.

1464
01:38:16.22 --> 01:38:17.74
Take the time to get the input.

1465
01:38:17.74 --> 01:38:25.42
Now there are situations where you don't have time to discuss or debate a decision.

1466
01:38:25.42 --> 01:38:31.90
There's, you know, or times where maybe you have time, but it's going to affect or impact

1467
01:38:31.90 --> 01:38:37.82
the ability to make an immediate execution, which is what oftentimes you're looking for.

1468
01:38:37.82 --> 01:38:39.02
You want to gain the initiative.

1469
01:38:39.02 --> 01:38:47.42
And sometimes gaining the initiative takes precedence over gaining consensus from everybody.

1470
01:38:47.42 --> 01:38:52.62
And it takes precedence over coming up with the best possible plan.

1471
01:38:52.62 --> 01:38:56.70
Because we want to do the best possible plan, but sometimes fast action is going to take

1472
01:38:56.70 --> 01:38:58.42
precedence over that.

1473
01:38:58.42 --> 01:39:06.22
And Pat and said something along the lines of a good plan executed now is better than a perfect

1474
01:39:06.22 --> 01:39:10.62
plan executed sometime next week.

1475
01:39:10.62 --> 01:39:15.50
So what happens is in those situations, yeah, you're going to have to make the call.

1476
01:39:15.50 --> 01:39:16.50
You're going to have to be decisive.

1477
01:39:16.50 --> 01:39:18.42
You're going to have to make the decision.

1478
01:39:18.42 --> 01:39:28.50
And because you've built trust with your team, then when you do need to make that call,

1479
01:39:28.50 --> 01:39:30.14
it won't be that big of a deal.

1480
01:39:30.14 --> 01:39:32.02
And people will execute it.

1481
01:39:32.02 --> 01:39:34.50
Now I've told this, I've said this before.

1482
01:39:34.50 --> 01:39:38.50
You know, life and I were having a conversation with some of our clients and as they were

1483
01:39:38.50 --> 01:39:42.34
kind of talking about the same thing about, you know, giving people orders and they're

1484
01:39:42.34 --> 01:39:45.38
not listening and what do you do?

1485
01:39:45.38 --> 01:39:48.38
And I asked life and the middle thing I said, hey, life, how many times did I tell

1486
01:39:48.38 --> 01:39:49.62
you, hey, life?

1487
01:39:49.62 --> 01:39:50.62
This is a command.

1488
01:39:50.62 --> 01:39:51.62
I'm telling you to do it.

1489
01:39:51.62 --> 01:39:53.62
I'm ordering you because you work for me.

1490
01:39:53.62 --> 01:39:55.34
Do it now.

1491
01:39:55.34 --> 01:39:59.26
And life was like zero times.

1492
01:39:59.26 --> 01:40:08.06
Now that being said, that being said, although I never in an administrative or an

1493
01:40:08.06 --> 01:40:11.38
planning situation ever said, life, you will do this now.

1494
01:40:11.38 --> 01:40:16.26
I'm ordering you because I am the senior man in the situation.

1495
01:40:16.26 --> 01:40:21.46
And tactical situations where we were in the field and we had to do things, we had to

1496
01:40:21.46 --> 01:40:23.38
make things happen quickly.

1497
01:40:23.38 --> 01:40:28.82
I definitely said things to him and said, hey, go do this now.

1498
01:40:28.82 --> 01:40:32.50
Like I would have said, you know, take that building out over there.

1499
01:40:32.50 --> 01:40:35.10
Hey, move the zombies over here or whatever.

1500
01:40:35.10 --> 01:40:37.66
And he would do it because he knew we didn't have time to discuss it.

1501
01:40:37.66 --> 01:40:43.14
Now what's interesting about that is it didn't just, it wasn't just me that was telling

1502
01:40:43.14 --> 01:40:46.86
life, sometimes life was saying to me, jockel, get the hom v's moved over here or

1503
01:40:46.86 --> 01:40:49.62
jockel, you need to get the element up on that high ground over there.

1504
01:40:49.62 --> 01:40:53.94
And you know what, we had trust, we had a relationship and I did it.

1505
01:40:53.94 --> 01:40:59.54
Even though I was senior to him, we didn't care who was senior to who.

1506
01:40:59.54 --> 01:41:01.02
That wasn't the important thing.

1507
01:41:01.02 --> 01:41:03.82
He saw something he was making a tactical decision.

1508
01:41:03.82 --> 01:41:08.94
I knew he wouldn't be telling me to do something unless he needed to have it happen.

1509
01:41:08.94 --> 01:41:15.74
So if he told me, hey, move the vehicles down the road, I'd be like Roger moving.

1510
01:41:15.74 --> 01:41:20.54
And that doesn't mean that we're, if you take us to a situation where we have the

1511
01:41:20.54 --> 01:41:23.38
time to debate.

1512
01:41:23.38 --> 01:41:25.82
Like he would come up and say, hey, jockel, I think it might be a good, you know, push

1513
01:41:25.82 --> 01:41:26.82
the vehicles down the road.

1514
01:41:26.82 --> 01:41:28.14
Oh, why what's going on?

1515
01:41:28.14 --> 01:41:30.66
Well, we're starting to see some movement out in the hinterland over there.

1516
01:41:30.66 --> 01:41:31.66
Okay, got it.

1517
01:41:31.66 --> 01:41:32.66
I'm going to track it.

1518
01:41:32.66 --> 01:41:33.86
I'm going to push two vehicles down there.

1519
01:41:33.86 --> 01:41:34.86
Cool.

1520
01:41:34.86 --> 01:41:35.86
Right.

1521
01:41:35.86 --> 01:41:36.86
That's a normal conversation.

1522
01:41:36.86 --> 01:41:38.86
But if all something there was gunfire, and they was like, push the vehicles down

1523
01:41:38.86 --> 01:41:41.66
the road to the north, I'd say doing it.

1524
01:41:41.66 --> 01:41:42.66
You know what I mean?

1525
01:41:42.66 --> 01:41:48.46
So there are definitely times where you don't want to sit there and sit around and debate

1526
01:41:48.46 --> 01:41:53.66
and figure out what the best plan is, that is the time where the leader or the follower

1527
01:41:53.66 --> 01:41:57.90
or the person has the most vision of the situation needs to make a call and make it happen.

1528
01:41:57.90 --> 01:42:03.14
So again, the better relationship you have, the easier this is going to be because you're

1529
01:42:03.14 --> 01:42:07.94
going to have that little mental unification of the commanders intent and of the task

1530
01:42:07.94 --> 01:42:14.98
and purpose and you're going to be able to be thinking along the same path.

1531
01:42:14.98 --> 01:42:20.10
And when you're doing that, everything gets a lot, a hell of a lot easier.

1532
01:42:20.10 --> 01:42:24.98
So when you got the time to take the input, take the input, have the debate, have the

1533
01:42:24.98 --> 01:42:25.98
discussion.

1534
01:42:25.98 --> 01:42:30.78
That builds the relationship so that when it comes time to be decisive and give a command,

1535
01:42:30.78 --> 01:42:35.86
you can give it and people react up and down the chain of command without a bunch of hesitation

1536
01:42:35.86 --> 01:42:39.06
and you can go back and later and say, hey, here's where I was talking about, here's

1537
01:42:39.06 --> 01:42:40.78
why we need to do this.

1538
01:42:40.78 --> 01:42:42.78
And that's it.

1539
01:42:42.78 --> 01:42:46.02
And then that trust is so critical.

1540
01:42:46.02 --> 01:42:47.02
Yeah, like so.

1541
01:42:47.02 --> 01:42:49.58
Are you saying build that relationship, whatever?

1542
01:42:49.58 --> 01:42:55.70
Yeah, and even at the time where it seems valuable, sure trust, but it's times like this

1543
01:42:55.70 --> 01:42:59.62
where that trust is going to shine even more, you know, when you can just say, you don't

1544
01:42:59.62 --> 01:43:02.18
even have to say why I do it because you just know.

1545
01:43:02.18 --> 01:43:03.18
You know it's a good reason.

1546
01:43:03.18 --> 01:43:05.82
Yeah, you know, while we're on this subject, I will tell you this is what you're

1547
01:43:05.82 --> 01:43:06.82
doing.

1548
01:43:06.82 --> 01:43:11.10
Well, because the more time you spent, if I was always giving orders to everyone and not

1549
01:43:11.10 --> 01:43:16.02
actually discussing, I was just ordering everyone to do, say everything all the time, your

1550
01:43:16.02 --> 01:43:18.38
your burning up your leadership capital.

1551
01:43:18.38 --> 01:43:19.38
Yeah.

1552
01:43:19.38 --> 01:43:23.22
Like when I, you know, when we're out in the field and when I was out in the field with

1553
01:43:23.22 --> 01:43:30.02
a little tunes, I sell them, gave an order over the radio because I wanted my guys to

1554
01:43:30.02 --> 01:43:31.02
lead.

1555
01:43:31.02 --> 01:43:36.86
When I did say something, that guys would just do it because it was me and they knew that

1556
01:43:36.86 --> 01:43:38.86
if I was saying it, it was something that had to be done.

1557
01:43:38.86 --> 01:43:41.38
So if I said, hey, everyone get in building 404 now.

1558
01:43:41.38 --> 01:43:45.34
Guys, okay, we're going to for everyone to get there.

1559
01:43:45.34 --> 01:43:48.78
Whereas if I was trying to give orders the whole time on every operation on every little

1560
01:43:48.78 --> 01:43:52.58
thing and every little detail, eventually you're just, what is it?

1561
01:43:52.58 --> 01:43:56.62
The boy that cried wolf and you want to give every order and people stop listening to you,

1562
01:43:56.62 --> 01:43:59.34
even though we're in the military and even though there's a chain of command and even

1563
01:43:59.34 --> 01:44:03.50
though they're supposed to listen to me, you abuse that thing and people will stop listening

1564
01:44:03.50 --> 01:44:09.22
to you, unless you, the, the more you talk, the less people listen and the less you talk,

1565
01:44:09.22 --> 01:44:10.90
the more people listen.

1566
01:44:10.90 --> 01:44:16.70
So I reserved my actual directives in the field to be the most important things that

1567
01:44:16.70 --> 01:44:20.50
I needed and if I didn't have to say that, I wouldn't, I would let my troopers lead,

1568
01:44:20.50 --> 01:44:22.58
let my leaders, my subordinate leaders to bleed.

1569
01:44:22.58 --> 01:44:24.66
I wanted them to.

1570
01:44:24.66 --> 01:44:25.66
Yeah.

1571
01:44:25.66 --> 01:44:28.86
Quality not quantity affirmative.

1572
01:44:28.86 --> 01:44:30.86
Next question.

1573
01:44:30.86 --> 01:44:34.10
Many vets are getting out of the military and go back to college.

1574
01:44:34.10 --> 01:44:38.30
Myself included or to college for the first time.

1575
01:44:38.30 --> 01:44:42.94
What advice do you have?

1576
01:44:42.94 --> 01:44:46.14
I like how you're doing sort of like the newscasters thing when you get the one the question.

1577
01:44:46.14 --> 01:44:47.14
I'm keeping it.

1578
01:44:47.14 --> 01:44:48.14
I like that.

1579
01:44:48.14 --> 01:44:49.14
I like that.

1580
01:44:49.14 --> 01:44:51.02
So you're going to college for the, you know, back to college, you're, you're, you've been

1581
01:44:51.02 --> 01:44:52.02
the military.

1582
01:44:52.02 --> 01:44:53.02
Okay.

1583
01:44:53.02 --> 01:44:56.18
Number one, out of the gate, crush it.

1584
01:44:56.18 --> 01:44:57.42
That's what you should do in college.

1585
01:44:57.42 --> 01:44:58.42
You should crush it.

1586
01:44:58.42 --> 01:45:03.14
You should study hard and you should crush it.

1587
01:45:03.14 --> 01:45:07.94
Now in order to do that, you gotta get a mindset because guess what you're going to be thinking

1588
01:45:07.94 --> 01:45:08.94
you get out of the military?

1589
01:45:08.94 --> 01:45:10.14
You may go, this is no big deal.

1590
01:45:10.14 --> 01:45:11.98
And, oh, this does, this doesn't matter.

1591
01:45:11.98 --> 01:45:16.86
You can be like, hey, I was in, I wasn't, I rack eight months ago.

1592
01:45:16.86 --> 01:45:19.94
I was in Afghanistan six months ago.

1593
01:45:19.94 --> 01:45:24.26
And now you're sitting here, tell me to read a book and write down words on a piece of

1594
01:45:24.26 --> 01:45:25.26
paper.

1595
01:45:25.26 --> 01:45:26.26
This doesn't matter.

1596
01:45:26.26 --> 01:45:33.38
That's an easy, that's an easy path to go down.

1597
01:45:33.38 --> 01:45:34.38
It's pretty easy to say.

1598
01:45:34.38 --> 01:45:35.38
You know why?

1599
01:45:35.38 --> 01:45:37.06
Because it's actually true.

1600
01:45:37.06 --> 01:45:42.82
And what you did in combat has more gravity and more consequence than anything you're

1601
01:45:42.82 --> 01:45:46.06
going to do in college.

1602
01:45:46.06 --> 01:45:49.86
And if you want to go down that path and be this stuff doesn't matter, this doesn't

1603
01:45:49.86 --> 01:45:52.06
important compared to what I've done.

1604
01:45:52.06 --> 01:45:54.42
So I'm going to blow it off.

1605
01:45:54.42 --> 01:45:56.22
That's a path you can go down if you want to.

1606
01:45:56.22 --> 01:45:57.22
I don't recommend it.

1607
01:45:57.22 --> 01:46:01.26
What I recommend you doing is straight up crushing college.

1608
01:46:01.26 --> 01:46:02.26
That's what I meant.

1609
01:46:02.26 --> 01:46:03.26
Recommend you doing.

1610
01:46:03.26 --> 01:46:04.26
How do you do that?

1611
01:46:04.26 --> 01:46:07.94
Because if you make that decision that you want to crush it, if you want to make

1612
01:46:07.94 --> 01:46:11.86
the decision that you're going to prove to people that you know what?

1613
01:46:11.86 --> 01:46:13.58
Yeah, I was overseas.

1614
01:46:13.58 --> 01:46:14.74
I was in combat now.

1615
01:46:14.74 --> 01:46:16.74
I'm coming back and you're little games that you're playing.

1616
01:46:16.74 --> 01:46:19.94
I'm going to beat you in your own games.

1617
01:46:19.94 --> 01:46:20.94
So how do you do that?

1618
01:46:20.94 --> 01:46:23.94
Number one.

1619
01:46:23.94 --> 01:46:29.02
Do the reading that you get assigned to do the assignments that you get tasked with.

1620
01:46:29.02 --> 01:46:30.02
Do everything.

1621
01:46:30.02 --> 01:46:33.18
Let that be your new job.

1622
01:46:33.18 --> 01:46:36.30
These silly little games that they're going to let that be your job.

1623
01:46:36.30 --> 01:46:37.70
Just like I was talking about OCS.

1624
01:46:37.70 --> 01:46:43.90
When I went to OCS, I made that like a game for me that I was going to win.

1625
01:46:43.90 --> 01:46:46.74
So do that with college.

1626
01:46:46.74 --> 01:46:48.58
And then on top of that, make it a game.

1627
01:46:48.58 --> 01:46:49.58
Yes.

1628
01:46:49.58 --> 01:46:55.54
Up of that as a deeper commanders intent, make it that you're going to not just do well

1629
01:46:55.54 --> 01:46:57.18
there as a game, but you're going to do well.

1630
01:46:57.18 --> 01:46:59.90
So you can get smarter.

1631
01:46:59.90 --> 01:47:05.98
So you can really actually learn information that's going to make you a better person

1632
01:47:05.98 --> 01:47:12.46
and give you better ability to dominate in the world.

1633
01:47:12.46 --> 01:47:13.90
That's what you should be doing in college.

1634
01:47:13.90 --> 01:47:17.10
Now these kids that you're going to be going to college with, they're not going to have this

1635
01:47:17.10 --> 01:47:18.10
attitude.

1636
01:47:18.10 --> 01:47:22.10
They're going to be, you know, hey, what do I need to do to get by?

1637
01:47:22.10 --> 01:47:23.82
What's Sally doing tonight?

1638
01:47:23.82 --> 01:47:28.14
I'm more concerned about that than I am about going out, dominating this course so that

1639
01:47:28.14 --> 01:47:36.78
I can get an A so that I have knowledge so I can go and crush some vocation later on in life.

1640
01:47:36.78 --> 01:47:38.38
So don't just do it as a game.

1641
01:47:38.38 --> 01:47:40.26
You've got to play the game a little bit.

1642
01:47:40.26 --> 01:47:45.22
I mean, you've got to get, for me, I get the game mentality going, but I've the game mentality

1643
01:47:45.22 --> 01:47:50.42
is rooted in something deeper and what it's rooted in is gaining knowledge to be smarter

1644
01:47:50.42 --> 01:47:54.18
and better as a human.

1645
01:47:54.18 --> 01:47:59.78
Now a couple things about college and the actual tactics, techniques and procedures to dominate.

1646
01:47:59.78 --> 01:48:03.50
Because when I went to college, I did dominate.

1647
01:48:03.50 --> 01:48:05.98
And when I went to high school, I did not dominate.

1648
01:48:05.98 --> 01:48:08.30
When I went to high school, I didn't care about high school.

1649
01:48:08.30 --> 01:48:09.30
I was like, whatever.

1650
01:48:09.30 --> 01:48:11.90
I've went and I go in the military.

1651
01:48:11.90 --> 01:48:12.90
Right.

1652
01:48:12.90 --> 01:48:18.38
So I went to college, I had a new attitude, which was I'm going to dominate.

1653
01:48:18.38 --> 01:48:21.74
I'm going to dominate battle against these people here.

1654
01:48:21.74 --> 01:48:23.14
I'm going to meet them.

1655
01:48:23.14 --> 01:48:25.06
So there's some of the things that are important.

1656
01:48:25.06 --> 01:48:28.18
Number one, college is all about time management.

1657
01:48:28.18 --> 01:48:29.18
Getting ahead of the curve.

1658
01:48:29.18 --> 01:48:31.22
It's so easy.

1659
01:48:31.22 --> 01:48:32.74
That's what happens with kids in college.

1660
01:48:32.74 --> 01:48:37.54
That's why they don't do well because for the first time, there's no one tracking them.

1661
01:48:37.54 --> 01:48:39.34
No one's imposing discipline on them.

1662
01:48:39.34 --> 01:48:42.86
You have to have, in order to well and college, you have to have self-discipline.

1663
01:48:42.86 --> 01:48:46.38
Because no one's going to tell you to start that paper that's doing six weeks.

1664
01:48:46.38 --> 01:48:48.98
No one's going to tell you to start it tomorrow.

1665
01:48:48.98 --> 01:48:51.38
You can just blow it off.

1666
01:48:51.38 --> 01:48:54.10
You can blow it off for five and a half weeks.

1667
01:48:54.10 --> 01:48:56.34
And then you've got to write a 30 page paper in two days.

1668
01:48:56.34 --> 01:48:57.98
And it's not going to be quality.

1669
01:48:57.98 --> 01:48:58.98
Yep.

1670
01:48:58.98 --> 01:48:59.98
No one's going to ask you.

1671
01:48:59.98 --> 01:49:00.98
Have you done your homework before dinner?

1672
01:49:00.98 --> 01:49:01.98
That's right.

1673
01:49:01.98 --> 01:49:04.34
So you need to get the time management going.

1674
01:49:04.34 --> 01:49:06.86
You need to get a disciplined time management schedule.

1675
01:49:06.86 --> 01:49:11.38
You need to get ahead of the curve as early as possible.

1676
01:49:11.38 --> 01:49:15.22
You know, when you want to, when a paper is due, a 30 page paper, you need to write it

1677
01:49:15.22 --> 01:49:16.22
in chunks.

1678
01:49:16.22 --> 01:49:17.42
And it makes it so easy.

1679
01:49:17.42 --> 01:49:19.82
I mean, it was a joke when I was going to college.

1680
01:49:19.82 --> 01:49:25.50
I would have my papers completely done like a week out.

1681
01:49:25.50 --> 01:49:26.50
Like a week out.

1682
01:49:26.50 --> 01:49:28.66
I would be done with a 30 page paper.

1683
01:49:28.66 --> 01:49:31.82
And then I would just be reviewing it and getting it all completely dialed.

1684
01:49:31.82 --> 01:49:37.58
And I've turned it in two days early and then move on to the next one.

1685
01:49:37.58 --> 01:49:38.58
Same thing with studying.

1686
01:49:38.58 --> 01:49:42.18
You do want to study hard right before the day of the test.

1687
01:49:42.18 --> 01:49:44.78
But you want to have knowledge already absorbed in there.

1688
01:49:44.78 --> 01:49:47.70
So you want to study leading up to that.

1689
01:49:47.70 --> 01:49:50.70
When you do reading that, I talked about highlight.

1690
01:49:50.70 --> 01:49:52.18
Break out the highlighters.

1691
01:49:52.18 --> 01:49:54.94
That's what I do in all these books that were hammering through right now.

1692
01:49:54.94 --> 01:49:56.58
We don't always, I always send out pictures of them.

1693
01:49:56.58 --> 01:49:58.18
They're all highlighted and marked up.

1694
01:49:58.18 --> 01:50:01.30
That's how I'm getting the good information out of them.

1695
01:50:01.30 --> 01:50:05.50
So highlight and then another little trick is to make the flashcards.

1696
01:50:05.50 --> 01:50:06.50
Are you to highlight?

1697
01:50:06.50 --> 01:50:08.50
And then I would make flashcards about what I highlighted.

1698
01:50:08.50 --> 01:50:09.50
Yeah.

1699
01:50:09.50 --> 01:50:10.98
Turn everything into a question.

1700
01:50:10.98 --> 01:50:17.10
And then you go through the flashcards and you're going to memorize stuff.

1701
01:50:17.10 --> 01:50:20.74
Oh, here's the big one.

1702
01:50:20.74 --> 01:50:21.74
This is really obvious.

1703
01:50:21.74 --> 01:50:25.62
But guess what people don't ask questions.

1704
01:50:25.62 --> 01:50:26.62
Ask questions.

1705
01:50:26.62 --> 01:50:28.10
I used to raise my hand.

1706
01:50:28.10 --> 01:50:30.38
I would sit in the front row first of all in college.

1707
01:50:30.38 --> 01:50:31.54
I sat in the front row.

1708
01:50:31.54 --> 01:50:32.54
I was 20.

1709
01:50:32.54 --> 01:50:33.54
I was a 20.

1710
01:50:33.54 --> 01:50:36.26
I think I was 27 or 28 years old going to college.

1711
01:50:36.26 --> 01:50:37.74
I would sit in the front row.

1712
01:50:37.74 --> 01:50:41.88
I'd sit in the little desk and I could look like Arnold Schwarzenegger and like a little

1713
01:50:41.88 --> 01:50:42.88
kid's desk.

1714
01:50:42.88 --> 01:50:46.14
I'd raise my hand all the way up.

1715
01:50:46.14 --> 01:50:48.66
All the way up over my head.

1716
01:50:48.66 --> 01:50:51.88
And they'd be looking at me, you know, because in college they kind of stop raising their

1717
01:50:51.88 --> 01:50:52.88
hand.

1718
01:50:52.88 --> 01:50:57.18
But I did it anyways just to be, just to be that.

1719
01:50:57.18 --> 01:50:59.06
Yeah, just to do it.

1720
01:50:59.06 --> 01:51:01.18
So I'd raise my, but you ask questions.

1721
01:51:01.18 --> 01:51:02.18
Because guess what?

1722
01:51:02.18 --> 01:51:03.18
The college kids.

1723
01:51:03.18 --> 01:51:04.18
They don't ask questions.

1724
01:51:04.18 --> 01:51:05.18
And guess what?

1725
01:51:05.18 --> 01:51:06.18
Adults don't ask questions.

1726
01:51:06.18 --> 01:51:08.18
because they had an eagle that didn't want to look stupid.

1727
01:51:08.18 --> 01:51:10.18
I don't care.

1728
01:51:10.18 --> 01:51:12.18
I'm here to win.

1729
01:51:12.18 --> 01:51:13.18
Exactly.

1730
01:51:13.18 --> 01:51:14.18
All right.

1731
01:51:14.18 --> 01:51:15.18
You don't think I'm smart.

1732
01:51:15.18 --> 01:51:16.18
Let's check out the GPA,

1733
01:51:16.18 --> 01:51:18.18
whole boy, you know what I'm saying?

1734
01:51:18.18 --> 01:51:20.18
So ask questions.

1735
01:51:20.18 --> 01:51:23.18
If I did any and ask questions as soon as that,

1736
01:51:23.18 --> 01:51:25.18
as soon as the knowledge,

1737
01:51:25.18 --> 01:51:27.18
as soon as the understanding train starts to get derailed,

1738
01:51:27.18 --> 01:51:28.18
a little bit,

1739
01:51:28.18 --> 01:51:30.18
ask the question right then.

1740
01:51:30.18 --> 01:51:33.18
Maybe give it a minute to see if you can get it back on track by yourself.

1741
01:51:33.18 --> 01:51:35.18
But the minute you realize you're not understanding,

1742
01:51:35.18 --> 01:51:37.18
you know what?

1743
01:51:37.18 --> 01:51:39.18
I don't understand that.

1744
01:51:39.18 --> 01:51:40.18
Can you re-explain that?

1745
01:51:40.18 --> 01:51:41.18
Because I'm not understanding.

1746
01:51:41.18 --> 01:51:42.18
Yeah, you don't want to miss that train.

1747
01:51:42.18 --> 01:51:43.18
You don't want to miss the train.

1748
01:51:43.18 --> 01:51:45.18
You don't want to go too far off course.

1749
01:51:45.18 --> 01:51:47.18
And then you're just lost.

1750
01:51:47.18 --> 01:51:49.18
So when you feel it coming off,

1751
01:51:49.18 --> 01:51:50.18
train catch up to quick.

1752
01:51:50.18 --> 01:51:52.18
Can you take a look and then just raise your hand.

1753
01:51:52.18 --> 01:51:53.18
Put your hand all the way up in the air,

1754
01:51:53.18 --> 01:51:54.18
sit in the front row.

1755
01:51:54.18 --> 01:51:56.18
Put your hand all the way up in the air.

1756
01:51:56.18 --> 01:51:59.18
And look at the teacher with the dead series face.

1757
01:51:59.18 --> 01:52:01.18
And they're going to look at you all nervous and be like,

1758
01:52:01.18 --> 01:52:02.18
Yes?

1759
01:52:02.18 --> 01:52:03.18
Yeah.

1760
01:52:03.18 --> 01:52:06.18
That's the only one I want to college. They called me John.

1761
01:52:06.18 --> 01:52:08.18
Because because that's what the attendance sheet said.

1762
01:52:08.18 --> 01:52:09.18
Because my real name is John.

1763
01:52:09.18 --> 01:52:11.18
And that's what the attendance sheet said.

1764
01:52:11.18 --> 01:52:14.18
And so they'd, yeah, I'd be sitting there and they'd say,

1765
01:52:14.18 --> 01:52:15.18
Yes, John.

1766
01:52:15.18 --> 01:52:16.18
And I'd say,

1767
01:52:16.18 --> 01:52:17.18
Yeah, I don't understand that.

1768
01:52:17.18 --> 01:52:18.18
Could you re-explain it?

1769
01:52:18.18 --> 01:52:19.18
Please.

1770
01:52:19.18 --> 01:52:21.18
Hey, when they called you,

1771
01:52:21.18 --> 01:52:22.18
John did that fuel the fire?

1772
01:52:22.18 --> 01:52:23.18
No, not at all.

1773
01:52:23.18 --> 01:52:25.18
It doesn't matter to me.

1774
01:52:25.18 --> 01:52:28.18
But it's the only time because I didn't know these people.

1775
01:52:28.18 --> 01:52:30.18
Because normally if I'm going to work with someone,

1776
01:52:30.18 --> 01:52:32.18
when I introduce myself,

1777
01:52:32.18 --> 01:52:33.18
I'll be like, hey, my name is John.

1778
01:52:33.18 --> 01:52:35.18
Because that's what everyone always calls me.

1779
01:52:35.18 --> 01:52:36.18
But these people would call my name in attendance.

1780
01:52:36.18 --> 01:52:39.18
And I didn't want to have this, you know,

1781
01:52:39.18 --> 01:52:40.18
adversarial release in the show.

1782
01:52:40.18 --> 01:52:42.18
Yes, I just, oh, yes, John, that's me.

1783
01:52:42.18 --> 01:52:44.18
The other thing is, you know,

1784
01:52:44.18 --> 01:52:46.18
do some psychological warfare.

1785
01:52:46.18 --> 01:52:48.18
You know, I would line up my pencils.

1786
01:52:48.18 --> 01:52:50.18
I do it on the podcast, you boa.

1787
01:52:50.18 --> 01:52:52.18
Right here, I line up pencils.

1788
01:52:52.18 --> 01:52:54.18
It's a, it's a, it's also getting into character.

1789
01:52:54.18 --> 01:52:55.18
Right.

1790
01:52:55.18 --> 01:52:56.18
You're priming yourself.

1791
01:52:56.18 --> 01:52:57.18
I'm priming myself.

1792
01:52:57.18 --> 01:52:59.18
I'm looking at the teacher like, I am so ready to take notes.

1793
01:52:59.18 --> 01:53:03.18
That if I have a downed pencil, it will not cost me a single letter.

1794
01:53:03.18 --> 01:53:05.18
I'll be back in the game.

1795
01:53:05.18 --> 01:53:08.18
Oh, your contingency.

1796
01:53:08.18 --> 01:53:10.18
Yeah, I contingency passes a stand and buy it.

1797
01:53:10.18 --> 01:53:13.18
And then so I sit in the front row, line up your pencils.

1798
01:53:13.18 --> 01:53:14.18
Have your notebooks ready.

1799
01:53:14.18 --> 01:53:16.18
Personally, challenge the teacher.

1800
01:53:16.18 --> 01:53:19.18
You wanted to, you want your personal challenge to be the pull

1801
01:53:19.18 --> 01:53:22.18
every piece of knowledge out of them.

1802
01:53:22.18 --> 01:53:24.18
And then go beyond what they know.

1803
01:53:24.18 --> 01:53:28.18
I was, I was, I was competing with the teachers.

1804
01:53:28.18 --> 01:53:31.18
I was trying to learn more than they actually knew.

1805
01:53:31.18 --> 01:53:34.18
And then they bring their little test for little exams.

1806
01:53:34.18 --> 01:53:36.18
You knew just crush them and smash them.

1807
01:53:36.18 --> 01:53:41.18
Now, the thing you got to be careful of here is this can get political.

1808
01:53:41.18 --> 01:53:43.18
This can get political.

1809
01:53:43.18 --> 01:53:47.18
And if you start being offensive with the way you act.

1810
01:53:47.18 --> 01:53:50.18
If you start rubbing it in their face, then guess what?

1811
01:53:50.18 --> 01:53:52.18
That can affect your grade.

1812
01:53:52.18 --> 01:53:55.18
And part of the game here is to get a good grade.

1813
01:53:55.18 --> 01:53:58.18
So you actually, it's a time for you to start building your relationship,

1814
01:53:58.18 --> 01:54:02.18
building skills, time to start building your leadership skills,

1815
01:54:02.18 --> 01:54:05.18
because you're going to start manipulating the teacher.

1816
01:54:05.18 --> 01:54:10.18
You want to make them think that you're actually super interested in a stupid,

1817
01:54:10.18 --> 01:54:13.18
crap class that they're teaching.

1818
01:54:13.18 --> 01:54:14.18
I want them to think that.

1819
01:54:14.18 --> 01:54:18.18
Now, some classes you're going to love, and they're going to, you're going to learn a lot from.

1820
01:54:18.18 --> 01:54:23.18
Like if you're into English and you get to take advanced grammar and syntax,

1821
01:54:23.18 --> 01:54:26.18
you're going to be sitting in there like yes, this is rocks.

1822
01:54:26.18 --> 01:54:28.18
But there's going to be some classes you don't want to take.

1823
01:54:28.18 --> 01:54:32.18
But you got to get in there and make your teacher think that you're super interested

1824
01:54:32.18 --> 01:54:34.18
and super fired up to learn that thing.

1825
01:54:34.18 --> 01:54:37.18
And that you're not just interested in the grade, but at the same time,

1826
01:54:37.18 --> 01:54:38.18
they got to know that grade.

1827
01:54:38.18 --> 01:54:40.18
It's important to you do.

1828
01:54:40.18 --> 01:54:42.18
So you want to get along with them.

1829
01:54:42.18 --> 01:54:45.18
Again, go into college.

1830
01:54:45.18 --> 01:54:48.18
If you're a veteran, you represent all of us out there.

1831
01:54:48.18 --> 01:54:51.18
So you should be going in there and just smashing college.

1832
01:54:51.18 --> 01:54:58.18
And that way, we have a better reputation, not just for being tough on the battlefield,

1833
01:54:58.18 --> 01:55:02.18
but for being smart and academically sound as well.

1834
01:55:02.18 --> 01:55:08.18
Yeah, and in a way, if you go to college later, you kind of in this weird way

1835
01:55:08.18 --> 01:55:09.18
have an advantage.

1836
01:55:09.18 --> 01:55:10.18
Oh, not even a weird way.

1837
01:55:10.18 --> 01:55:12.18
You straight up have an advantage.

1838
01:55:12.18 --> 01:55:14.18
Yeah, especially after you've been in the military.

1839
01:55:14.18 --> 01:55:15.18
Yeah, so much man.

1840
01:55:15.18 --> 01:55:17.18
Because you got the discipline.

1841
01:55:17.18 --> 01:55:21.18
But the only thing that'll screw you is if you have the discipline,

1842
01:55:21.18 --> 01:55:23.18
but you don't apply it because you think all this doesn't matter.

1843
01:55:23.18 --> 01:55:25.18
This is nothing compared to combat.

1844
01:55:25.18 --> 01:55:27.18
That's what I started off by addressing.

1845
01:55:27.18 --> 01:55:27.18
Yeah.

1846
01:55:27.18 --> 01:55:28.18
This is important.

1847
01:55:28.18 --> 01:55:30.18
You just have to make it important.

1848
01:55:30.18 --> 01:55:34.18
Yeah, because, okay, you pay for college.

1849
01:55:34.18 --> 01:55:38.18
And this is the part that I think, well, I know I just couldn't connect the dots on this.

1850
01:55:38.18 --> 01:55:42.18
No matter how many people said it, I just couldn't connect the dots that you're going

1851
01:55:42.18 --> 01:55:43.18
to college.

1852
01:55:43.18 --> 01:55:45.18
It's worth, you know.

1853
01:55:45.18 --> 01:55:47.18
This is, it's all up to you.

1854
01:55:47.18 --> 01:55:49.18
These people are here to give you an education and all this stuff.

1855
01:55:49.18 --> 01:55:51.18
You can do whatever you want to do.

1856
01:55:51.18 --> 01:55:53.18
You don't even have to choose a major right away.

1857
01:55:53.18 --> 01:55:54.18
You can do whatever you want to do.

1858
01:55:54.18 --> 01:55:56.18
You're going to have an education to do it.

1859
01:55:56.18 --> 01:55:58.18
And then to me, it just didn't register.

1860
01:55:58.18 --> 01:56:01.18
It just seemed like the same thing as high school except

1861
01:56:01.18 --> 01:56:03.18
no one was monitoring your grades.

1862
01:56:03.18 --> 01:56:06.18
And there was a way a lot more going on.

1863
01:56:06.18 --> 01:56:08.18
So really it was the same thing.

1864
01:56:08.18 --> 01:56:11.18
You pay for it, you're one of the cool kids.

1865
01:56:11.18 --> 01:56:13.18
There's cool parties on the, you know,

1866
01:56:13.18 --> 01:56:18.18
but the different thing which was better than high school is you had your own place to stay.

1867
01:56:18.18 --> 01:56:22.18
Other people were staying around you that were your peers that were hanging out

1868
01:56:22.18 --> 01:56:24.18
and didn't have to go to bed at a certain time.

1869
01:56:24.18 --> 01:56:28.18
So if you're not that into grades and stuff in high school

1870
01:56:28.18 --> 01:56:32.18
and you don't see that clearly like how you would if you're like 27, 28 years old

1871
01:56:32.18 --> 01:56:36.18
coming back and seeing like the real value of education and college and stuff.

1872
01:56:36.18 --> 01:56:39.18
But all that's going to look like is just one big party.

1873
01:56:39.18 --> 01:56:40.18
Yeah.

1874
01:56:40.18 --> 01:56:42.18
Then maybe have some class or something going under in the day.

1875
01:56:42.18 --> 01:56:44.18
And then you make your own schedule.

1876
01:56:44.18 --> 01:56:47.18
You're like, hey, choose this class at this time and this time you're like,

1877
01:56:47.18 --> 01:56:55.18
you almost, it's almost like one of the biggest tests in college is if you can pass everything that you just talked about.

1878
01:56:55.18 --> 01:56:56.18
Yeah.

1879
01:56:56.18 --> 01:56:59.18
If you can go and you can get the discipline, you can get the time management.

1880
01:56:59.18 --> 01:57:01.18
You can go to the classes, you can study the stuff.

1881
01:57:01.18 --> 01:57:06.18
That's one of the tests in college and military personnel shouldn't fail that test.

1882
01:57:06.18 --> 01:57:10.18
The only reason they, I'm telling you, no, no, no, no, I'm sure there's all the reasons.

1883
01:57:10.18 --> 01:57:15.18
But definitely the fact that they're not taken it seriously is what's going to cost.

1884
01:57:15.18 --> 01:57:18.18
Oh, like what they've been through is like a more impact.

1885
01:57:18.18 --> 01:57:19.18
Yeah, we're more impact.

1886
01:57:19.18 --> 01:57:20.18
And you know what?

1887
01:57:20.18 --> 01:57:21.18
That's true.

1888
01:57:21.18 --> 01:57:25.18
But again, we're not trying to, we want to win.

1889
01:57:25.18 --> 01:57:26.18
Yeah.

1890
01:57:26.18 --> 01:57:28.18
You know, I want you if you're a veteran, you're a listener.

1891
01:57:28.18 --> 01:57:31.18
I want you to dominate and it shouldn't even be fair.

1892
01:57:31.18 --> 01:57:35.18
I mean, honestly, when I was going to college, it wasn't even fair.

1893
01:57:35.18 --> 01:57:37.18
I mean, because I was just ahead.

1894
01:57:37.18 --> 01:57:40.18
I was just working. I was concentrating. I was focused.

1895
01:57:40.18 --> 01:57:43.18
And I was making myself focus.

1896
01:57:43.18 --> 01:57:44.18
Yeah.

1897
01:57:44.18 --> 01:57:46.18
And yeah, so that's what you got to do.

1898
01:57:46.18 --> 01:57:49.18
I remember I had this, and you know, what at UH, there's like, you know, there's

1899
01:57:49.18 --> 01:57:52.18
There's a small classes in this lecture classes.

1900
01:57:52.18 --> 01:57:55.18
So I remember in the lecture classes, like criminology or something,

1901
01:57:55.18 --> 01:57:56.18
I haven't been taking.

1902
01:57:56.18 --> 01:57:57.18
And there was this guy in front.

1903
01:57:57.18 --> 01:58:01.18
He was basically you, except a real like more nerdy type guy.

1904
01:58:01.18 --> 01:58:05.18
And he'd be right in the front, not like just in the front.

1905
01:58:05.18 --> 01:58:07.18
Real right here in front of the teacher.

1906
01:58:07.18 --> 01:58:10.18
And there's like a projector thing that he kind of he's right next to that.

1907
01:58:10.18 --> 01:58:13.18
And man, this guy, if you had a question, boom, he was on.

1908
01:58:13.18 --> 01:58:15.18
He would monopolize the whole class.

1909
01:58:15.18 --> 01:58:15.18
Yeah.

1910
01:58:15.18 --> 01:58:18.18
And I mean, they're like, man, this guy is motivated.

1911
01:58:18.18 --> 01:58:19.18
I don't know why.

1912
01:58:19.18 --> 01:58:22.18
This is major, but he's not ashamed or nothing.

1913
01:58:22.18 --> 01:58:26.18
And so one day we had these, like, speeches, like,

1914
01:58:26.18 --> 01:58:28.18
you have to like read up on something and then present.

1915
01:58:28.18 --> 01:58:29.18
Yeah.

1916
01:58:29.18 --> 01:58:31.18
I don't remember.

1917
01:58:31.18 --> 01:58:32.18
I think I did it.

1918
01:58:32.18 --> 01:58:33.18
Maybe I did it.

1919
01:58:33.18 --> 01:58:34.18
I don't know.

1920
01:58:34.18 --> 01:58:35.18
I remember when it was his turn.

1921
01:58:35.18 --> 01:58:36.18
And so auditorium.

1922
01:58:36.18 --> 01:58:37.18
So you have a little mic, you know.

1923
01:58:37.18 --> 01:58:38.18
The teacher had a mic.

1924
01:58:38.18 --> 01:58:39.18
He gives you the mic.

1925
01:58:39.18 --> 01:58:40.18
He says your speech.

1926
01:58:40.18 --> 01:58:43.18
So this guy's turned to go up.

1927
01:58:43.18 --> 01:58:46.18
And the teacher, you know, gives him a mic.

1928
01:58:46.18 --> 01:58:47.18
He's like, I don't need that.

1929
01:58:47.18 --> 01:58:49.18
Because can you guys hear me in the back?

1930
01:58:49.18 --> 01:58:51.18
And I was like, damn.

1931
01:58:51.18 --> 01:58:53.18
This guy knows, you know, he's into this thing.

1932
01:58:53.18 --> 01:58:54.18
He gives his speech.

1933
01:58:54.18 --> 01:58:56.18
And he, he might as well have been the teacher.

1934
01:58:56.18 --> 01:58:57.18
This guy.

1935
01:58:57.18 --> 01:58:58.18
And he was a older guy.

1936
01:58:58.18 --> 01:59:00.18
He was maybe, you know, I'm like 18 years old.

1937
01:59:00.18 --> 01:59:02.18
This guy's like probably 25 or so.

1938
01:59:02.18 --> 01:59:03.18
Maybe he was a veteran actually.

1939
01:59:03.18 --> 01:59:06.18
Maybe a man who wouldn't surprise me because this guy was there.

1940
01:59:06.18 --> 01:59:07.18
And he was there to win.

1941
01:59:07.18 --> 01:59:08.18
Yeah.

1942
01:59:08.18 --> 01:59:10.18
And thinking back as an older guy.

1943
01:59:10.18 --> 01:59:13.18
Man, I wish I just had that attitude.

1944
01:59:13.18 --> 01:59:14.18
Yeah.

1945
01:59:14.18 --> 01:59:15.18
Because I had the capability.

1946
01:59:15.18 --> 01:59:16.18
Men, the classes that I liked.

1947
01:59:16.18 --> 01:59:19.18
Like I took a muscular skeletal anatomy class.

1948
01:59:19.18 --> 01:59:21.18
And I got an A and that one.

1949
01:59:21.18 --> 01:59:23.18
I think I got like 97% and I was pissed.

1950
01:59:23.18 --> 01:59:24.18
Like, not last 3%.

1951
01:59:24.18 --> 01:59:28.18
But it's so thinking like really my whole just outlook on that class.

1952
01:59:28.18 --> 01:59:29.18
Like, I was there.

1953
01:59:29.18 --> 01:59:30.18
But it was a little bit different than your.

1954
01:59:30.18 --> 01:59:32.18
I was straight up interested in it.

1955
01:59:32.18 --> 01:59:33.18
Yeah.

1956
01:59:33.18 --> 01:59:34.18
No.

1957
01:59:34.18 --> 01:59:35.18
And there was classes that I was straight up interested in too.

1958
01:59:35.18 --> 01:59:36.18
Yeah.

1959
01:59:36.18 --> 01:59:40.18
And those classes are easier to get through because you like you enjoy them.

1960
01:59:40.18 --> 01:59:41.18
Yeah.

1961
01:59:41.18 --> 01:59:43.18
But man, that attitude of like, I'm going to win.

1962
01:59:43.18 --> 01:59:48.18
Like whatever, like the test was like this almost a way to just show off how powerful

1963
01:59:48.18 --> 01:59:49.18
that is.

1964
01:59:49.18 --> 01:59:50.18
This little thing.

1965
01:59:50.18 --> 01:59:53.18
That's exactly what I was my attitude.

1966
01:59:53.18 --> 01:59:55.18
And I, you know, I want one thing.

1967
01:59:55.18 --> 01:59:59.18
One more thing I want to add is when I talk about concentrating in focused.

1968
01:59:59.18 --> 02:00:02.18
I would set up the time management.

1969
02:00:02.18 --> 02:00:07.18
You don't want to try in because I know everybody everybody that's, you know, been overseas.

1970
02:00:07.18 --> 02:00:08.18
They said, oh, I got trouble.

1971
02:00:08.18 --> 02:00:10.18
I have trouble concentrating, right?

1972
02:00:10.18 --> 02:00:15.18
So, so what you want to do is you want to chunk down your times.

1973
02:00:15.18 --> 02:00:19.18
So you're not trying to force yourself to concentrate for six straight hours.

1974
02:00:19.18 --> 02:00:23.18
You know, you want to hate my own a bang out an hour and a half right now.

1975
02:00:23.18 --> 02:00:24.18
I'm going to get into this.

1976
02:00:24.18 --> 02:00:26.18
But I'm going to go roll to you, too.

1977
02:00:26.18 --> 02:00:28.18
I want to come back and do another hour and a half.

1978
02:00:28.18 --> 02:00:31.18
I'm going to go work out and come back and do another hour.

1979
02:00:31.18 --> 02:00:37.18
Then I'm going to hang out for a little bit, eat some dinner and then I'm going to go and, you know, finish up and review stuff.

1980
02:00:37.18 --> 02:00:46.18
Then I'd say, that's this one way to overcome the attention span disorder that we all have.

1981
02:00:46.18 --> 02:00:48.18
Of a heck, I can't concentrate on that right now.

1982
02:00:48.18 --> 02:00:52.18
One way to overcome that is to try and do stuff for short periods time.

1983
02:00:52.18 --> 02:00:57.18
Even when I was writing the book, I didn't write for 10 hours at a time.

1984
02:00:57.18 --> 02:01:01.18
I wrote for an hour, you know, 50 minutes, but I did it every day consistently.

1985
02:01:01.18 --> 02:01:04.18
And that's how you, so you want to chunk this stuff down.

1986
02:01:04.18 --> 02:01:07.18
So you don't have to sit there and focus.

1987
02:01:07.18 --> 02:01:08.18
So sometimes you have to.

1988
02:01:08.18 --> 02:01:13.18
But you don't want to have to sit there and focus on something for six straight hours.

1989
02:01:13.18 --> 02:01:14.18
It's difficult.

1990
02:01:14.18 --> 02:01:15.18
Yeah, man.

1991
02:01:15.18 --> 02:01:16.18
Give yourself a rest.

1992
02:01:16.18 --> 02:01:21.18
How are you saying, like, um, and this comes from a lack of perspective.

1993
02:01:21.18 --> 02:01:24.18
I mean, to not be able to do this or to choose not to do it or whatever.

1994
02:01:24.18 --> 02:01:28.18
It comes from again, a lack of perspective that I 18 year old would have.

1995
02:01:28.18 --> 02:01:33.18
But going back, how you can get smarter and understand that you're using that to be like,

1996
02:01:33.18 --> 02:01:35.18
more educated, better person.

1997
02:01:35.18 --> 02:01:38.18
So if you're kind of, call it gameification, what you're doing.

1998
02:01:38.18 --> 02:01:40.18
I'm going to make this into a game right.

1999
02:01:40.18 --> 02:01:43.18
So use that, like, okay, let's say I learned about whatever XYZ.

2000
02:01:43.18 --> 02:01:44.18
I'm going to use that.

2001
02:01:44.18 --> 02:01:47.18
What we learned today, I'm using that, like, on a, like, back to a video game where, um,

2002
02:01:47.18 --> 02:01:49.18
you know, you choose your guy or your kid.

2003
02:01:49.18 --> 02:01:50.18
This is game called super.

2004
02:01:50.18 --> 02:01:52.18
We're going to try and use it in a real scenario.

2005
02:01:52.18 --> 02:01:53.18
Yeah, we'll apply it in real life.

2006
02:01:53.18 --> 02:01:57.18
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fully, but, um, like, okay, there's this game called super

2007
02:01:57.18 --> 02:01:58.18
off road.

2008
02:01:58.18 --> 02:01:59.18
You get a truck and you race.

2009
02:01:59.18 --> 02:02:03.18
And if you win, you get these points to add acceleration.

2010
02:02:03.18 --> 02:02:04.18
You get to add turbo boost.

2011
02:02:04.18 --> 02:02:06.18
You get whatever you got to add and you only have to look.

2012
02:02:06.18 --> 02:02:07.18
So basically, you're doing that.

2013
02:02:07.18 --> 02:02:10.18
So you learn XYZ and pick up a boom.

2014
02:02:10.18 --> 02:02:12.18
Now I got XYZ and the intellectual brain.

2015
02:02:12.18 --> 02:02:14.18
You know, now I can take on the world with this XYZ.

2016
02:02:14.18 --> 02:02:16.18
I just learned and just keep like that.

2017
02:02:16.18 --> 02:02:18.18
That's actually how I feel when I read now.

2018
02:02:18.18 --> 02:02:19.18
Not as bad.

2019
02:02:19.18 --> 02:02:20.18
I just learned about that.

2020
02:02:20.18 --> 02:02:22.18
Like boom, boom, playing to and then now when I get to

2021
02:02:22.18 --> 02:02:26.18
up or whatever, I'm like, oh, shoot, I'm kind of like a upgraded person now.

2022
02:02:26.18 --> 02:02:27.18
No, no, no, no, no, no, no about this.

2023
02:02:27.18 --> 02:02:29.18
That's what caught that's what that's great.

2024
02:02:29.18 --> 02:02:30.18
That's a great way of thinking about it.

2025
02:02:30.18 --> 02:02:32.18
College should upgrade you mentally.

2026
02:02:32.18 --> 02:02:35.18
So you have more firepower to use against the world.

2027
02:02:35.18 --> 02:02:35.18
Yes.

2028
02:02:35.18 --> 02:02:37.18
And whether that yeah, and then you can use it.

2029
02:02:37.18 --> 02:02:38.18
The next class.

2030
02:02:38.18 --> 02:02:39.18
Yeah, the next class.

2031
02:02:39.18 --> 02:02:40.18
Yeah, man.

2032
02:02:40.18 --> 02:02:42.18
And that lack of perspective, man, when you're 18,

2033
02:02:42.18 --> 02:02:48.18
the party's going on, you know, you could probably fall into that too.

2034
02:02:48.18 --> 02:02:51.18
But just less likely because after coming from the military,

2035
02:02:51.18 --> 02:02:54.18
if you had, it's like, when you're 18, you're pressure to go to college this way.

2036
02:02:54.18 --> 02:02:57.18
After high school, everyone's talking about what you're saying the military guys

2037
02:02:57.18 --> 02:02:58.18
could fall into what?

2038
02:02:58.18 --> 02:03:02.18
Like the trap of like, okay, but thinking about it, not as like party.

2039
02:03:02.18 --> 02:03:03.18
Partying.

2040
02:03:03.18 --> 02:03:03.18
Partying.

2041
02:03:03.18 --> 02:03:04.18
Yeah.

2042
02:03:04.18 --> 02:03:05.18
Of course they do.

2043
02:03:05.18 --> 02:03:06.18
Environment.

2044
02:03:06.18 --> 02:03:07.18
Oh, yeah.

2045
02:03:07.18 --> 02:03:07.18
So seductive.

2046
02:03:07.18 --> 02:03:08.18
Yeah.

2047
02:03:08.18 --> 02:03:09.18
Oh, absolutely.

2048
02:03:09.18 --> 02:03:11.18
Because the military guys are good at the GI bill.

2049
02:03:11.18 --> 02:03:14.18
They're like, rolling out of a nice car.

2050
02:03:14.18 --> 02:03:17.18
Everyone else is struggling students and they're pretty much set.

2051
02:03:17.18 --> 02:03:18.18
Right popular.

2052
02:03:18.18 --> 02:03:19.18
And all of a sudden, they're like, oh, yeah.

2053
02:03:19.18 --> 02:03:21.18
Well, you know, they know about the world.

2054
02:03:21.18 --> 02:03:22.18
They've been around the world.

2055
02:03:22.18 --> 02:03:26.18
They know how to drink and they know how to party really well.

2056
02:03:26.18 --> 02:03:29.18
And so they can take a leadership role in partying with other people.

2057
02:03:29.18 --> 02:03:31.18
They can have a great time.

2058
02:03:31.18 --> 02:03:31.18
Yeah.

2059
02:03:31.18 --> 02:03:32.18
And that's cool.

2060
02:03:32.18 --> 02:03:38.18
But make sure you don't make sure you upgrade your truck.

2061
02:03:38.18 --> 02:03:39.18
Yeah.

2062
02:03:39.18 --> 02:03:40.18
But you're there too.

2063
02:03:40.18 --> 02:03:40.18
Yeah.

2064
02:03:40.18 --> 02:03:45.18
So you're more likely when, especially when you make the decision kind of on your own to go back.

2065
02:03:45.18 --> 02:03:46.18
Yeah.

2066
02:03:46.18 --> 02:03:48.18
Like I said, when your 18 coming out of high school, everyone's talking with your parents

2067
02:03:48.18 --> 02:03:52.18
or talking about it most likely kids around you're like, hey, I got into this college.

2068
02:03:52.18 --> 02:03:57.18
And if you're the guy who's not running a college unless you have some cool other cool plan or whatever.

2069
02:03:57.18 --> 02:03:59.18
Unless you just enjoy the military.

2070
02:03:59.18 --> 02:04:00.18
Right.

2071
02:04:00.18 --> 02:04:01.18
But that's another thing.

2072
02:04:01.18 --> 02:04:03.18
You know, they went to the military, but what are you doing?

2073
02:04:03.18 --> 02:04:05.18
You're like, oh, I better go to college then.

2074
02:04:05.18 --> 02:04:06.18
You know, unless you're going to be.

2075
02:04:06.18 --> 02:04:10.18
So you kind of go because you're expected to go, but you don't have that clarity.

2076
02:04:10.18 --> 02:04:12.18
Like, if you go back later.

2077
02:04:12.18 --> 02:04:14.18
Like some people who nowadays is popular.

2078
02:04:14.18 --> 02:04:17.18
Well, I do think there are a lot of military guys that once they're getting out,

2079
02:04:17.18 --> 02:04:19.18
people say, what you're going to do now?

2080
02:04:19.18 --> 02:04:20.18
Oh, there you go.

2081
02:04:20.18 --> 02:04:21.18
Okay.

2082
02:04:21.18 --> 02:04:23.18
They go, well, I'm going to go to college and me's my GI Bill and they go, okay.

2083
02:04:23.18 --> 02:04:24.18
Yes.

2084
02:04:24.18 --> 02:04:26.18
But they're going without a, without a focus and without a plan.

2085
02:04:26.18 --> 02:04:29.18
So military guys can fall into that trap as well.

2086
02:04:29.18 --> 02:04:32.18
And that's why I'm hoping that they're listening to this going, hey, you know what?

2087
02:04:32.18 --> 02:04:33.18
Absolutely.

2088
02:04:33.18 --> 02:04:37.18
Take advantage of that fact that you're with a bunch of people and you can hang out.

2089
02:04:37.18 --> 02:04:39.18
You can party and have a good time.

2090
02:04:39.18 --> 02:04:42.18
But have the discipline that you win.

2091
02:04:42.18 --> 02:04:43.18
Yeah.

2092
02:04:43.18 --> 02:04:44.18
None of it matters.

2093
02:04:44.18 --> 02:04:45.18
That party doesn't mean anything.

2094
02:04:45.18 --> 02:04:53.18
If you don't win every day and make yourself better and come out of there with the ability now to set yourself up for a good life.

2095
02:04:53.18 --> 02:04:55.18
Because that's what college is supposed to do.

2096
02:04:55.18 --> 02:04:57.18
It's supposed to give you opportunity.

2097
02:04:57.18 --> 02:04:58.18
Yeah.

2098
02:04:58.18 --> 02:05:01.18
That's what you want is opportunities that you can take advantage of it.

2099
02:05:01.18 --> 02:05:03.18
And it's still a treatment.

2100
02:05:03.18 --> 02:05:08.18
It's like, I'm thinking back to any party, hang out situation.

2101
02:05:08.18 --> 02:05:10.18
It's not serving me at all right now.

2102
02:05:10.18 --> 02:05:11.18
No.

2103
02:05:11.18 --> 02:05:12.18
At all.

2104
02:05:12.18 --> 02:05:13.18
Not one.

2105
02:05:13.18 --> 02:05:15.18
I was like, that's what really got in the way.

2106
02:05:15.18 --> 02:05:18.18
I think in that party like I was in this big party or because it wasn't the case.

2107
02:05:18.18 --> 02:05:19.18
But it's just there.

2108
02:05:19.18 --> 02:05:25.18
The social scene just pulled head way more of a draw than making it to club course.

2109
02:05:25.18 --> 02:05:26.18
You're human being.

2110
02:05:26.18 --> 02:05:28.18
You like social activity.

2111
02:05:28.18 --> 02:05:30.18
Most human beings like that.

2112
02:05:30.18 --> 02:05:31.18
Yeah, man.

2113
02:05:31.18 --> 02:05:35.18
Not all of us consider around to be like, no, I do not negative one to speak to other people.

2114
02:05:35.18 --> 02:05:40.18
If I went back to college for, you know, if I found myself in that situation,

2115
02:05:40.18 --> 02:05:43.18
about it, just like how you said you bring your A game.

2116
02:05:43.18 --> 02:05:44.18
Bring me every single day.

2117
02:05:44.18 --> 02:05:47.18
I wouldn't literally be, you know how like when you train for a tournament.

2118
02:05:47.18 --> 02:05:48.18
Yeah.

2119
02:05:48.18 --> 02:05:51.18
You know, and you're just like, yeah, guys are going, that's the last thing I want to do.

2120
02:05:51.18 --> 02:05:52.18
I want to eat right now.

2121
02:05:52.18 --> 02:05:54.18
I want to rest and I can't wait to get back to training.

2122
02:05:54.18 --> 02:05:57.18
So I can learn some new stuff getting better.

2123
02:05:57.18 --> 02:05:59.18
You know, so it's like laser focus.

2124
02:05:59.18 --> 02:06:00.18
You know, yeah.

2125
02:06:00.18 --> 02:06:02.18
And even if it's not like focusing on the goal the whole time,

2126
02:06:02.18 --> 02:06:06.18
you're focusing on winning that day and winning the next day, winning this week.

2127
02:06:06.18 --> 02:06:07.18
You know, man.

2128
02:06:07.18 --> 02:06:10.18
That's a valuable tool, man.

2129
02:06:10.18 --> 02:06:11.18
Value-related advice as well.

2130
02:06:11.18 --> 02:06:13.18
Take it.

2131
02:06:13.18 --> 02:06:15.18
Next question.

2132
02:06:15.18 --> 02:06:22.18
Can you discuss peer leadership a bit, such as during the BOLC,

2133
02:06:22.18 --> 02:06:25.18
which is basic officer leader course.

2134
02:06:25.18 --> 02:06:26.18
In the army.

2135
02:06:26.18 --> 02:06:30.18
Ranger school or other training environments without a command structure.

2136
02:06:30.18 --> 02:06:36.18
I know you've touched on it before and said that it's probably the toughest form of leadership.

2137
02:06:36.18 --> 02:06:42.18
But if you could discuss things that have worked well for you and any tips in these environments.

2138
02:06:42.18 --> 02:06:44.18
So peer leadership.

2139
02:06:44.18 --> 02:06:47.18
And yeah, actually whether that's harder than leading up the chain of command,

2140
02:06:47.18 --> 02:06:56.18
which takes the most amount of nuance and technique and savvy as opposed to peer leadership,

2141
02:06:56.18 --> 02:06:58.18
which definitely takes a lot as well.

2142
02:06:58.18 --> 02:07:00.18
And there's nothing new here.

2143
02:07:00.18 --> 02:07:01.18
Yeah.

2144
02:07:01.18 --> 02:07:04.18
Nothing new when you're trying to lead peers just like when you're trying to lead up the chain of command,

2145
02:07:04.18 --> 02:07:06.18
what do you do?

2146
02:07:06.18 --> 02:07:07.18
No, I'm going to want you to be humble.

2147
02:07:07.18 --> 02:07:08.18
You're going to listen.

2148
02:07:08.18 --> 02:07:10.18
You're going to lead when it's time to lead.

2149
02:07:10.18 --> 02:07:12.18
You're going to follow when it's time to follow.

2150
02:07:12.18 --> 02:07:14.18
Take the hard jobs, work hard.

2151
02:07:14.18 --> 02:07:18.18
Put the priority on the team and set it yourself.

2152
02:07:18.18 --> 02:07:20.18
Accept the blame when things go wrong.

2153
02:07:20.18 --> 02:07:23.18
Give credit away to the team when things go right.

2154
02:07:23.18 --> 02:07:25.18
Keep your ego in check.

2155
02:07:25.18 --> 02:07:27.18
And keeping your ego in check is very important.

2156
02:07:27.18 --> 02:07:31.18
Because when it comes to peer leadership, this turns into like there's a little ego struggle going on.

2157
02:07:31.18 --> 02:07:34.18
There's actually a big ego struggle coming on over the whole time.

2158
02:07:34.18 --> 02:07:41.18
Because what peers are actually competing with each other in some form for promotion for authority,

2159
02:07:41.18 --> 02:07:42.18
for recognition.

2160
02:07:42.18 --> 02:07:45.18
So you're going to want that credit.

2161
02:07:45.18 --> 02:07:48.18
You're going to want to be recognized and those little things inside your brain.

2162
02:07:48.18 --> 02:07:52.18
If you really want to be a good peer leader, you got to let him go.

2163
02:07:52.18 --> 02:07:54.18
You got to let him go.

2164
02:07:54.18 --> 02:07:57.18
You got to stay humble.

2165
02:07:57.18 --> 02:08:03.18
Now, for instance, when you come up with a plan, you can't get addicted to your plan.

2166
02:08:03.18 --> 02:08:07.18
You can't think that your plan, you can't impose your plan on your peers.

2167
02:08:07.18 --> 02:08:08.18
You don't want to do that.

2168
02:08:08.18 --> 02:08:10.18
You want to hear other people out.

2169
02:08:10.18 --> 02:08:17.18
And in fact, one way to build leadership credibility is when you become champions of other people's plans.

2170
02:08:17.18 --> 02:08:18.18
And you go, man, that's awesome.

2171
02:08:18.18 --> 02:08:20.18
I'll run with it.

2172
02:08:20.18 --> 02:08:23.18
And you take a leadership role with someone else's plan.

2173
02:08:23.18 --> 02:08:24.18
How cool is that?

2174
02:08:24.18 --> 02:08:26.18
They actually love you then.

2175
02:08:26.18 --> 02:08:28.18
They say, man, jockel does not have an ego.

2176
02:08:28.18 --> 02:08:31.18
He's running with the plan I put out and he's giving me credit for it.

2177
02:08:31.18 --> 02:08:38.18
Of course, your building leadership leadership credit with that person.

2178
02:08:38.18 --> 02:08:42.18
Now, so those are all those are challenges, right?

2179
02:08:42.18 --> 02:08:45.18
And a lot of that again boils back to ego.

2180
02:08:45.18 --> 02:08:55.18
But the other thing is you got to be mentally nimble when you're doing peer leadership because you're going to be constantly shifting back and forth and back and forth and back and forth between

2181
02:08:55.18 --> 02:08:58.18
the dichotomies of leadership.

2182
02:08:58.18 --> 02:09:11.18
The things that being aggressive, but not being overbearing, being a leader, being a follower, stepping up and yet not stepping on people's toes.

2183
02:09:11.18 --> 02:09:17.18
So you've got to balance those and you've got to be going back and forth between those all the time.

2184
02:09:17.18 --> 02:09:23.18
And that's what makes peer leadership hard because if you and I are peers,

2185
02:09:23.18 --> 02:09:26.18
if I'm in charge of you, then we know that.

2186
02:09:26.18 --> 02:09:35.18
And so I can kind of, I can be a little bit more inactive in my balancing act because I'm in charge.

2187
02:09:35.18 --> 02:09:40.18
So hey, I'm going to do, you know, I can be less active in balancing.

2188
02:09:40.18 --> 02:09:45.18
And if, same thing if you work for me, we know what the roles are.

2189
02:09:45.18 --> 02:09:47.18
You're a leader, I'm following.

2190
02:09:47.18 --> 02:09:48.18
It's that.

2191
02:09:48.18 --> 02:09:51.18
The other way around, I'm leading in your following.

2192
02:09:51.18 --> 02:09:53.18
And we know what the roles are.

2193
02:09:53.18 --> 02:09:54.18
We appear.

2194
02:09:54.18 --> 02:09:56.18
It's just constantly balancing.

2195
02:09:56.18 --> 02:10:04.18
And if I go too strong in one direction, I'm going to affect your, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to offend your ego.

2196
02:10:04.18 --> 02:10:10.18
Which is going to make you turn against me, which is where all these problems come from.

2197
02:10:10.18 --> 02:10:20.18
So the, and the biggest thing about that about that balance is what makes you good at balancing it is knowing that it's there.

2198
02:10:20.18 --> 02:10:26.18
That's what gives you the ability to balance is that you know that you are balancing.

2199
02:10:26.18 --> 02:10:30.18
When people don't know what that they're balancing, that's what they're just like, I'm leading.

2200
02:10:30.18 --> 02:10:34.18
I'm stepping up so they just lead and everyone goes, man, this guy's a jerky as a big ego.

2201
02:10:34.18 --> 02:10:36.18
Okay, that's what you don't want to do.

2202
02:10:36.18 --> 02:10:47.18
But when you know that, hey, if I'm stepping up to lead right now, I need to pay attention to look around and see how people are taking it and make sure that I'm getting the support of people.

2203
02:10:47.18 --> 02:10:53.18
And if I'm not, then I go, hey, echo, you know, you seem to have really good important how this, why don't you take this section and lead it.

2204
02:10:53.18 --> 02:10:59.18
So people see, oh, Jocca is not trying to take control of everything. He's not a control freak.

2205
02:10:59.18 --> 02:11:02.18
That's what you want to make happen.

2206
02:11:02.18 --> 02:11:08.18
So that is in a nutshell, some advice on how to lead in the peer situations.

2207
02:11:08.18 --> 02:11:15.18
Yeah, fully in the, when, when you first meet someone's up here, especially guys, guys,

2208
02:11:15.18 --> 02:11:22.18
have this a lot where if they're even close to being you identity wise, like, you know,

2209
02:11:22.18 --> 02:11:31.18
within a certain age of you, within a certain build of you or whatever, your brain goes into this real focus mode, this small part of your brain.

2210
02:11:31.18 --> 02:11:36.18
And it, it wants to make a decision, is this guy, my enemy or my friend?

2211
02:11:36.18 --> 02:11:41.18
I want one of them. I don't care which one, but I just gotta figure out what it is.

2212
02:11:41.18 --> 02:11:50.18
So automatically you feel sense of competition when you see a guy near you in your, like, environment, you know, like, if you're, you got, you got to the gym or you got a GG2, like,

2213
02:11:50.18 --> 02:11:56.18
what happens if the new guy walks in and he's about your size and he walks into the GG2?

2214
02:11:56.18 --> 02:11:59.18
Yeah, there's a arena. There's a new set of competitions.

2215
02:11:59.18 --> 02:12:03.18
Yep, that's a set of an, oh, don't let him be wearing a black belt. Oh, that's even closer to you now.

2216
02:12:03.18 --> 02:12:08.18
Now it's like, okay, who's this guy, you know, who's this guy? And then we got something to settle.

2217
02:12:08.18 --> 02:12:12.18
Yeah, but let's say he rolls up to you and he's just so nice to you.

2218
02:12:12.18 --> 02:12:17.18
Yeah, and then you guys roll, he's, he gets you whatever he's armed me.

2219
02:12:17.18 --> 02:12:21.18
Right, but he's really nice. He likes the same football team you like.

2220
02:12:21.18 --> 02:12:25.18
I'm saying he disarmed me by saying, hey, man, what's going on?

2221
02:12:25.18 --> 02:12:27.18
Hey, it's really good to meet you. I've heard of you.

2222
02:12:27.18 --> 02:12:31.18
I know you're trying to be a Dean Lister. Dean Lister is like, one of the main guys I've always liked.

2223
02:12:31.18 --> 02:12:35.18
It's great to meet you, Jocco. I appreciate you guys letting me come to the gym, man.

2224
02:12:35.18 --> 02:12:41.18
I love to roll with you sometime, you know, if you get the chances, you know, I know a really respect your all's game.

2225
02:12:41.18 --> 02:12:47.18
Right. Yes, exactly right. So boom, now that decision that you put like on on this prime level, you have to make.

2226
02:12:47.18 --> 02:12:52.18
Yeah, I made you're like, okay, I got you. I made you're my friend. You're my ally, but you get a guy who only mad dogs you,

2227
02:12:52.18 --> 02:12:56.18
but with other calculations, he's kind of the same as you more or less.

2228
02:12:56.18 --> 02:13:01.18
Yeah, if he's mad at me. So now this is the thing to take what you're saying, which is a hundred percent right.

2229
02:13:01.18 --> 02:13:06.18
And folks, this isn't just about to jitz you, obviously. This is about a life.

2230
02:13:06.18 --> 02:13:13.18
And when you meet a person who comes into your office, and they're, they have a role at their company or within your company or what

2231
02:13:13.18 --> 02:13:18.18
at another company and you're meeting them for the first time. And you know that there's somewhere equivalent of what you're there and a EVP.

2232
02:13:18.18 --> 02:13:25.18
Or there an SVP or there a VP and you know that you are to, or there a regional manager or whatever the case may be,

2233
02:13:25.18 --> 02:13:33.18
your automatically doing assessment. So what do you want to do? Do you want to, do you want to bring them to make the friend decision or faux decision?

2234
02:13:33.18 --> 02:13:37.18
Right. Let's be leaders. Yeah, and that's the key right there.

2235
02:13:37.18 --> 02:13:41.18
Create relationships, not adversaries.

2236
02:13:41.18 --> 02:13:46.18
Yes, or not adversarial relations. Yes.

2237
02:13:46.18 --> 02:13:52.18
Plan, where does obviously, but yeah, and the key there, how you're saying, is you want them to make the decision that you're there,

2238
02:13:52.18 --> 02:13:57.18
or the decision that you're there, friend. Yes. It's not, you're not saying, you make this decision that that's your friend.

2239
02:13:57.18 --> 02:14:07.18
And you know what else? Just going to ego and insecurities. The more secure you are as a person, the easier it is to be nice to them.

2240
02:14:07.18 --> 02:14:13.18
Right. Like when someone comes into the gym and they're mad dog and me, it's not hard for me to be like, hey man, what's going on?

2241
02:14:13.18 --> 02:14:19.18
Hey, what, what are you from? Right. Because I know I've been training for a long time. I know that they're not going to mop the map up with me.

2242
02:14:19.18 --> 02:14:24.18
That's not, that's not going to happen. Like because I'm confident, you know, I'm secure.

2243
02:14:24.18 --> 02:14:32.18
I know I've been training for a long time. If I'm in a business world, and I meet someone and I know that there might be close to my equivalent.

2244
02:14:32.18 --> 02:14:38.18
Am I insecure? Where I got to bow up to them and act like a tough guy? No. I'm actually confident that what I do as well.

2245
02:14:38.18 --> 02:14:44.18
What I do is good. I know I need a good team. I know that I'm solid. I know I know my information well. I know I'm a hard worker.

2246
02:14:44.18 --> 02:14:50.18
So why am I going to bow up to them? I got, I'm not threatened by them. It's no big deal to me. Let's do this.

2247
02:14:50.18 --> 02:15:00.18
Right. And yeah, and even if you feel those, you're compelled to kind of have those feelings or to do something to bow up or whatever, because maybe you're insecure, whatever.

2248
02:15:00.18 --> 02:15:04.18
Just keep it on the inside. You know, don't behave like that.

2249
02:15:04.18 --> 02:15:06.18
Yeah, it's just me. No, that okay.

2250
02:15:06.18 --> 02:15:15.18
Because when somebody bows up to you, when somebody bows up to me, I don't get the feeling that they're secure and confident.

2251
02:15:15.18 --> 02:15:21.18
And I don't even get the feeling that they're good. I get the feeling like, oh, this guy's protecting something. This guy's hiding something.

2252
02:15:21.18 --> 02:15:25.18
He must not be that good because he's intimidated by me. That's why he's blowing up to me.

2253
02:15:25.18 --> 02:15:35.18
If he wasn't intimidated by me, he'd be treated me cool. But he isn't intimidated by me. So the tougher you try and act, that's actually to a skilled kind of person that can read people.

2254
02:15:35.18 --> 02:15:39.18
The tougher you try and act, the weaker you actually appear.

2255
02:15:39.18 --> 02:15:47.18
Yeah. Now if you're running around intimidating white belts, either in the business world or on the just a mad that doesn't matter, because you can win anyways.

2256
02:15:47.18 --> 02:15:48.18
No.

2257
02:15:48.18 --> 02:15:52.18
So be intimidating the white belt.

2258
02:15:52.18 --> 02:15:54.18
Yeah.

2259
02:15:54.18 --> 02:15:56.18
Yeah.

2260
02:15:56.18 --> 02:15:57.18
Yeah.

2261
02:15:57.18 --> 02:15:59.18
Make them want to be friends with you.

2262
02:15:59.18 --> 02:16:00.18
It's a good one.

2263
02:16:00.18 --> 02:16:02.18
I'm not going to have it out.

2264
02:16:02.18 --> 02:16:09.18
Okay. Next question. Jockel, how would you have handled the leadership role in the first World War trench and trenches?

2265
02:16:09.18 --> 02:16:12.18
In other words, seemingly helpless situation.

2266
02:16:12.18 --> 02:16:18.18
This is a question that I didn't even want to answer because it's just such a brutal question.

2267
02:16:18.18 --> 02:16:20.18
And that's why I did answer it.

2268
02:16:20.18 --> 02:16:23.18
Because I want to have some brutal questions.

2269
02:16:23.18 --> 02:16:31.18
And I would love to think that I would have stood up like a man and like a hero and don't everything in my power to stop.

2270
02:16:31.18 --> 02:16:33.18
The madness.

2271
02:16:33.18 --> 02:16:40.18
And to come up with a new way and protest the futile tactics and raise my hand and say, we're not doing this sir.

2272
02:16:40.18 --> 02:16:43.18
I will not send my men to their deaths.

2273
02:16:43.18 --> 02:16:49.18
I would love to think that that's what I would have done.

2274
02:16:49.18 --> 02:16:56.18
And I can tell you when I was told to do things and I rack that I thought we shouldn't be doing.

2275
02:16:56.18 --> 02:16:58.18
I said, hey, you know what? That's not a good idea.

2276
02:16:58.18 --> 02:16:59.18
Let's find another way.

2277
02:16:59.18 --> 02:17:02.18
I've done that before.

2278
02:17:02.18 --> 02:17:07.18
We got, we had operations that we looked at and said, you know what?

2279
02:17:07.18 --> 02:17:09.18
This is not a smart operation.

2280
02:17:09.18 --> 02:17:12.18
There's a really high risk and there's very low reward.

2281
02:17:12.18 --> 02:17:16.18
Let's not do that one. Let's find another way to do it.

2282
02:17:16.18 --> 02:17:18.18
So I know I've done that.

2283
02:17:18.18 --> 02:17:22.18
But you take me and you put me in a World War one trench.

2284
02:17:22.18 --> 02:17:24.18
Now we have a different mind.

2285
02:17:24.18 --> 02:17:35.18
I have a different brain and the thing that I'm scared of, the thing that haunts me is what if my mind was trapped?

2286
02:17:35.18 --> 02:17:41.18
What if I couldn't see the futility of the situation?

2287
02:17:41.18 --> 02:17:43.18
Because everyone's saying, no, you know what?

2288
02:17:43.18 --> 02:17:47.18
When we do this attack, we've done these things and we've prepared for it.

2289
02:17:47.18 --> 02:17:49.18
We've got more bombs. We're going to drop.

2290
02:17:49.18 --> 02:17:50.18
We've got more artillery.

2291
02:17:50.18 --> 02:17:53.18
This is going to be the one.

2292
02:17:53.18 --> 02:17:56.18
You just need to go over the top one more time.

2293
02:17:56.18 --> 02:17:59.18
What if I believe that?

2294
02:17:59.18 --> 02:18:05.18
What if I couldn't see the solutions in front of me?

2295
02:18:05.18 --> 02:18:08.18
And that's what scares me.

2296
02:18:08.18 --> 02:18:22.18
Is what if you become so brainwashed and closed minded that you cannot see anymore?

2297
02:18:22.18 --> 02:18:26.18
And you lose your ability to think.

2298
02:18:26.18 --> 02:18:31.18
And that's why all the time you're going to hear me say free your mind.

2299
02:18:31.18 --> 02:18:33.18
That's what I'm talking about.

2300
02:18:33.18 --> 02:18:34.18
Free your mind.

2301
02:18:34.18 --> 02:18:37.18
That is the situation that I am talking about.

2302
02:18:37.18 --> 02:18:39.18
Question.

2303
02:18:39.18 --> 02:18:40.18
What is around you?

2304
02:18:40.18 --> 02:18:46.18
Question the status quo and question the authority and the leadership and your subordinates.

2305
02:18:46.18 --> 02:18:49.18
Question everything.

2306
02:18:49.18 --> 02:19:05.18
In order to make sure that you're not following a well-worn path, a well-worn path that other people have gone by.

2307
02:19:05.18 --> 02:19:11.18
Maybe it's a path that you've walked before, but it's a well-worn path.

2308
02:19:11.18 --> 02:19:16.18
And it's a path that leads to suffering and pain and tragedy.

2309
02:19:16.18 --> 02:19:26.18
And you can't get off the path because your mind is not free.

2310
02:19:26.18 --> 02:19:32.18
So, how would I have handled the leadership situation in a world-worn one?

2311
02:19:32.18 --> 02:19:37.18
I cannot honestly answer that question.

2312
02:19:37.18 --> 02:19:45.18
But the way I try and live and the way I try and think is,

2313
02:19:45.18 --> 02:19:49.18
is one with an open mind of free mind.

2314
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:57.18
That can see different perspectives that can detach from what's being told to me.

2315
02:19:57.18 --> 02:20:04.18
And I can question it and I can come up with a different solution.

2316
02:20:04.18 --> 02:20:09.18
Free your mind.

2317
02:20:09.18 --> 02:20:11.18
Sound.

2318
02:20:11.18 --> 02:20:16.18
And a nice.

2319
02:20:16.18 --> 02:20:18.18
Next question.

2320
02:20:18.18 --> 02:20:19.18
Juckle.

2321
02:20:19.18 --> 02:20:20.18
Ego.

2322
02:20:20.18 --> 02:20:23.18
Tough versus smart.

2323
02:20:23.18 --> 02:20:25.18
So, wait, what is this D thing?

2324
02:20:25.18 --> 02:20:29.18
Is it better to be tough than smart or just in general?

2325
02:20:29.18 --> 02:20:32.18
Well, you just read the question as it was stated.

2326
02:20:32.18 --> 02:20:38.18
It just said, topic for podcast, tough versus smart.

2327
02:20:38.18 --> 02:20:42.18
And in my opinion, I don't think you need to be tough versus smart.

2328
02:20:42.18 --> 02:20:45.18
I don't think it needs to be tough or smart.

2329
02:20:45.18 --> 02:20:48.18
I think you need to be tough and smart.

2330
02:20:48.18 --> 02:20:52.18
I don't think those two traits are mutually exclusive at all.

2331
02:20:52.18 --> 02:20:56.18
And being tough and being smart is actually what we want.

2332
02:20:56.18 --> 02:21:01.18
We, you know, so we think of tough.

2333
02:21:01.18 --> 02:21:08.18
I think we think of using front of using blunt force to solve a problem.

2334
02:21:08.18 --> 02:21:09.18
Right.

2335
02:21:09.18 --> 02:21:14.18
And you might think that using blunt force to solve a problem is stupid.

2336
02:21:14.18 --> 02:21:24.18
And at the same time, you might think that stepping back from a problem and taking a look or stepping back away from it might be giving up.

2337
02:21:24.18 --> 02:21:28.18
So, you're weak.

2338
02:21:28.18 --> 02:21:31.18
Or you're not tough.

2339
02:21:31.18 --> 02:21:35.18
But there are times when those options are the best options.

2340
02:21:35.18 --> 02:21:38.18
There's sometimes when blunt force is the best option.

2341
02:21:38.18 --> 02:21:48.18
And you just got a power through and you got to beat tough and you got to get over the hurdle or over the obstacle or through the obstacle through blunt force trauma.

2342
02:21:48.18 --> 02:21:55.18
And there's other times where the best possible thing you could do is step back and quit beating your head against the wall

2343
02:21:55.18 --> 02:21:58.18
and trying to blunt force through something.

2344
02:21:58.18 --> 02:22:03.18
You want to step back and find another way you want to be smarter, not harder.

2345
02:22:03.18 --> 02:22:07.18
And I think, again, this comes out to balance.

2346
02:22:07.18 --> 02:22:14.18
And people pushing when it's a good time to push and a good time to be tough.

2347
02:22:14.18 --> 02:22:20.18
And at the same time knowing that you need to balance that with being smart.

2348
02:22:20.18 --> 02:22:35.18
And only way you're going to be able to do that, the only way you're going to be able to figure out if you're just being too smart or not smart enough or too tough or not tough enough is to be able to detach and step back and look and see assess the situation.

2349
02:22:35.18 --> 02:22:42.18
If you get to in the weeds on it, you won't be able to see that, hey, you've beat your head against the wall 47 times.

2350
02:22:42.18 --> 02:22:44.18
That's enough. Stop.

2351
02:22:44.18 --> 02:22:47.18
Step back and find another way.

2352
02:22:47.18 --> 02:22:57.18
That's like if you're so engrossed in solving the problem and finding the perfect solution and finding the least impact way through the smartest resolution.

2353
02:22:57.18 --> 02:23:08.18
You don't, if you don't step back from that, you might not see that if you wait any longer on your brilliant plan, you're going to be overrun by the problem itself.

2354
02:23:08.18 --> 02:23:13.18
So being smart and being tough are not mutually exclusive.

2355
02:23:13.18 --> 02:23:22.18
To be both and the way that you balance them is by stepping back and detaching and doing always doing an assessment of what's happening.

2356
02:23:22.18 --> 02:23:39.18
So what if you had to choose, and I'm going to make the question even harder, no specific scenario, what if you had to choose, you got to be either really smart but not tough or really smart or really tough and not smart.

2357
02:23:39.18 --> 02:23:42.18
What will we do to you?

2358
02:23:42.18 --> 02:23:45.18
Unfortunately, you have to go with being smarter.

2359
02:23:45.18 --> 02:23:46.18
That's not unfortunate.

2360
02:23:46.18 --> 02:23:54.18
It's not unfortunate, but the reality is being smarter is better because being smarter means you can find another solution.

2361
02:23:54.18 --> 02:24:02.18
You know, the, the, the, the, you might be banging your head against might literally be impossible through that, through that section.

2362
02:24:02.18 --> 02:24:08.18
And if all you're going to do is beat your head against it, eventually you're going to, you're going to not make and you're going to die.

2363
02:24:08.18 --> 02:24:22.18
So being smart is always better. Yeah, and I guess I should add it just in life. Let's say, you know, that really the question I was wondering is like in life, you know, God was there and he said, okay, I'm going to bestow one of these on you in just in your life.

2364
02:24:22.18 --> 02:24:29.18
You can either have a knack for being really smart, but not tough at all or really tough and not be smart.

2365
02:24:29.18 --> 02:24:36.18
Because it's, it's, I, I shouldn't even be like making this like this is a hard decision being smarter is better.

2366
02:24:36.18 --> 02:24:51.18
Being, being smarter is better. That's, there's no doubt about it. That's being smarter is better. But get by the way, being smarter look, look at the human race. Why do we rule the world over the animals? I mean, you tell me that you're tougher than a chimpanzee.

2367
02:24:51.18 --> 02:25:00.18
Well, me, yeah, but I'm just saying, right, the only reason the thing that wins is intellect and it'll win every single time. Well, it'll win a lot of the time.

2368
02:25:00.18 --> 02:25:09.18
And if you're smart, you can figure out a way to overcome the toughness. Yeah. Yeah, and not even necessarily to fire your body. Yeah, exactly right. Exactly right.

2369
02:25:09.18 --> 02:25:16.18
Like when you say, are you to am I tougher than a gorilla will say, well, in a way, yeah, you know, if I have a shotgun.

2370
02:25:16.18 --> 02:25:26.18
Yeah, or if I have a, yeah, anything, you know, anything that I think up to build or buy, you know, because of other people like me thought it up and I use their knowledge, you know, because that's smart to do it.

2371
02:25:26.18 --> 02:25:33.18
So, I'm going to go back to the original question or we'll question, we answer a little while ago about college, like go to college and improve your smartness. Get smarter.

2372
02:25:33.18 --> 02:25:42.18
Yeah, that's why I always say that on the podcast. I'm not always talking about being stronger and faster and bigger and tougher. I'm always talking about you got to be smarter, too.

2373
02:25:42.18 --> 02:25:44.18
No doubt about it.

2374
02:25:44.18 --> 02:25:51.18
The success I've had from my life is zero of it. Just about zero of it has come from anything physical or being tough.

2375
02:25:51.18 --> 02:26:08.18
Now, there is a mental toughness that does help you when you are doing intellectual things. I mean, I can force myself to do some intellectual goals or some intellectual challenges that if I wasn't, if I didn't, I didn't tough, it's in the best word, but if I wasn't mentally tough, I wouldn't be able to do it.

2376
02:26:08.18 --> 02:26:16.18
Right. Yeah, but if you're smarter, if you're smarter, figure out what's to get mentally tough. Like you're like, hey, I know I'm not mentally tough.

2377
02:26:16.18 --> 02:26:22.18
I'm smart enough to not mentally tough or I'm not physically tough. I mean, figure out a way to get me out. I'll figure out a good workout.

2378
02:26:22.18 --> 02:26:31.18
You would rather be the guy that is really tough and can stay in cold water for 45 minutes or the guy that events a wetsuit like Jack O'Neill.

2379
02:26:31.18 --> 02:26:34.18
And I can stay in the water for El Luminator amount of time now.

2380
02:26:34.18 --> 02:26:35.18
There you go.

2381
02:26:35.18 --> 02:26:38.18
Case in point, Jack O'Neill, keeping it real.

2382
02:26:38.18 --> 02:26:40.18
The wrong name, dropper.

2383
02:26:40.18 --> 02:26:43.18
Next question.

2384
02:26:43.18 --> 02:26:48.18
I didn't say I knew, but, you know, I'm playing Jack, we go way back.

2385
02:26:48.18 --> 02:26:52.18
You've got one for one.

2386
02:26:52.18 --> 02:26:53.18
Maybe.

2387
02:26:53.18 --> 02:26:54.18
Maybe.

2388
02:26:54.18 --> 02:26:56.18
Okay.

2389
02:26:56.18 --> 02:26:57.18
Jocco.

2390
02:26:57.18 --> 02:27:06.18
As far as self-improvement and getting after it goes, who standard should one measure themselves by?

2391
02:27:06.18 --> 02:27:13.18
So, who do I use as a standard to measure myself by?

2392
02:27:13.18 --> 02:27:19.18
It's really everyone.

2393
02:27:19.18 --> 02:27:23.18
And no one.

2394
02:27:23.18 --> 02:27:32.18
Because, or if there's people in the world that have skills and strength and talent that I will never have.

2395
02:27:32.18 --> 02:27:36.18
I don't know.

2396
02:27:36.18 --> 02:27:45.18
I mean, some of these notions that you can be, whatever you want to be as long as you want to bad enough, those are not true.

2397
02:27:45.18 --> 02:27:48.18
They're fairy tales.

2398
02:27:48.18 --> 02:27:53.18
We all have limitations.

2399
02:27:53.18 --> 02:28:00.18
And I don't have the right genes to be an Olympic weightlifting champion.

2400
02:28:00.18 --> 02:28:13.18
I don't have the right genetics to be an Olympic champion sprinter or a gymnast or whatever sport you want to name.

2401
02:28:13.18 --> 02:28:29.18
Now, sure, if I trained my whole life, perhaps I could have achieved some high level in those sports, but I can tell you I do not have the DNA to be the best in the world in those categories.

2402
02:28:29.18 --> 02:28:34.18
So, what does that mean?

2403
02:28:34.18 --> 02:28:36.18
Does that mean that I give up?

2404
02:28:36.18 --> 02:28:40.18
Does that mean that I quit, of course not.

2405
02:28:40.18 --> 02:28:42.18
Not at all.

2406
02:28:42.18 --> 02:28:56.18
It means that I'm going to try to be the best that I can be the strongest, the fastest, the smartest, the smartest human that I can become.

2407
02:28:56.18 --> 02:28:59.18
That's what I'm going to go for.

2408
02:28:59.18 --> 02:29:06.18
And I will, I will compare myself to others and look at them and see what they're doing.

2409
02:29:06.18 --> 02:29:09.18
And I'll say that it is possible.

2410
02:29:09.18 --> 02:29:13.18
How close can I get to that greatness?

2411
02:29:13.18 --> 02:29:20.18
How close can I get to that glory?

2412
02:29:20.18 --> 02:29:25.18
But the reality is that my glory?

2413
02:29:25.18 --> 02:29:35.18
It doesn't happen in front of a crowd, it doesn't happen in a stadium, it doesn't happen on a stage.

2414
02:29:35.18 --> 02:29:41.18
There's no metals handed out.

2415
02:29:41.18 --> 02:29:54.18
My glory happens in the darkness of the early morning in solitude alone, where I try.

2416
02:29:54.18 --> 02:30:02.18
And I try and I try again to be everything that I possibly can be.

2417
02:30:02.18 --> 02:30:13.18
The best that I possibly can be better than I was yesterday.

2418
02:30:13.18 --> 02:30:19.18
In better than other people thought I could be.

2419
02:30:19.18 --> 02:30:31.18
Faster and stronger and smarter and with one victory that no one can ever take away from me.

2420
02:30:31.18 --> 02:30:39.18
A victory that has earned every single day.

2421
02:30:39.18 --> 02:30:48.18
A victory of determination and will and discipline.

2422
02:30:48.18 --> 02:31:03.18
The victory that has achieved because I will not stop.

2423
02:31:03.18 --> 02:31:08.18
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2424
02:31:08.18 --> 02:31:17.18
So once again, thanks to everyone for listening and downloading and supporting the podcast through the various options that we have to do.

2425
02:31:17.18 --> 02:31:20.18
That we have to do so echo water those options.

2426
02:31:20.18 --> 02:31:21.18
Options.

2427
02:31:21.18 --> 02:31:25.18
If you care about supplementation, the good kind that work.

2428
02:31:25.18 --> 02:31:27.18
Go to on it on its supplements.

2429

2430
02:31:31.18 --> 02:31:32.18
Memory all that stuff.

2431
02:31:32.18 --> 02:31:33.18
Proving to work by the way.

2432
02:31:33.18 --> 02:31:34.18
I don't know if you knew that.

2433
02:31:34.18 --> 02:31:39.18
You know some supplements, they don't prove they just say, hey, this is what's in it.

2434
02:31:39.18 --> 02:31:40.18
That's it.

2435
02:31:40.18 --> 02:31:42.18
These ones are proven and you can even go on the website.

2436
02:31:42.18 --> 02:31:44.18
Look at all their research is cool.

2437

2441
02:31:58.18 --> 02:31:59.18
Like passive supporting.

2442
02:31:59.18 --> 02:32:02.18
It's like easy, you know, but it costs you nothing.

2443
02:32:02.18 --> 02:32:03.18
Cost you nothing.

2444
02:32:03.18 --> 02:32:07.18
You're actually just getting after it.

2445
02:32:07.18 --> 02:32:08.18
It's really great really.

2446
02:32:08.18 --> 02:32:12.18
But you're supporting the podcast for free.

2447
02:32:12.18 --> 02:32:14.18
Yeah, that's big at it.

2448
02:32:14.18 --> 02:32:15.18
That is legit.

2449
02:32:15.18 --> 02:32:26.18
Or if you like the shirts and mugs and stuff, you know, if you're into that, which I don't I am.

2450
02:32:26.18 --> 02:32:27.18
I'm they're pretty cool.

2451
02:32:27.18 --> 02:32:35.18
We do, I do add like layers to the shirts, you know, they're not just, oh, a cool saying or discipline equals freedom.

2452
02:32:35.18 --> 02:32:36.18
That's it.

2453
02:32:36.18 --> 02:32:40.18
There's like more to it, you know, it's like you're saying that, you know, you know,

2454
02:32:40.18 --> 02:32:43.18
you're doing it.

2455
02:32:43.18 --> 02:32:48.18
So you're saying there's a whole another level of cool to the shirts that you make.

2456
02:32:48.18 --> 02:32:50.18
I think they're cool.

2457
02:32:50.18 --> 02:32:51.18
But I don't want to make that.

2458
02:32:51.18 --> 02:32:52.18
There's a great reaction.

2459
02:32:52.18 --> 02:32:53.18
There you go.

2460
02:32:53.18 --> 02:32:54.18
But I don't want to be like, hey, they're cool.

2461
02:32:54.18 --> 02:32:57.18
And then people go there, they'll be like, you know, they have a different opinion.

2462
02:32:57.18 --> 02:32:58.18
They're not cool.

2463
02:32:58.18 --> 02:33:00.18
I don't want to be like, I push you not cool stuff.

2464
02:33:00.18 --> 02:33:01.18
I think they're cool.

2465
02:33:01.18 --> 02:33:03.18
Go to jacco store dot com.

2466
02:33:03.18 --> 02:33:06.18
If you think they're cool, go to get one or two.

2467
02:33:06.18 --> 02:33:09.18
And that's also supporting the podcast and you get the culture.

2468
02:33:09.18 --> 02:33:10.18
So that's cool.

2469
02:33:10.18 --> 02:33:11.18
We dig that.

2470
02:33:11.18 --> 02:33:12.18
Yeah.

2471
02:33:12.18 --> 02:33:14.18
And I use the actually people ask me this.

2472
02:33:14.18 --> 02:33:16.18
So it is relevant where what kind of shirts do I use?

2473
02:33:16.18 --> 02:33:20.18
I use the blended one, poly, poly cotton, and so they're like soft.

2474
02:33:20.18 --> 02:33:22.18
There's a bunch of different kinds.

2475
02:33:22.18 --> 02:33:23.18
There's a really light one.

2476
02:33:23.18 --> 02:33:26.18
And then there's like a medium, but still soft.

2477
02:33:26.18 --> 02:33:30.18
And you know, that's the one I chose because the light one, it's good.

2478
02:33:30.18 --> 02:33:33.18
And I like those a lot, but some people might not, you know,

2479
02:33:33.18 --> 02:33:34.18
Too light.

2480
02:33:34.18 --> 02:33:35.18
Too light, maybe.

2481
02:33:35.18 --> 02:33:36.18
Yeah.

2482
02:33:36.18 --> 02:33:37.18
Maybe.

2483
02:33:37.18 --> 02:33:38.18
I don't know.

2484
02:33:38.18 --> 02:33:40.18
If you get that out and but it's.

2485
02:33:40.18 --> 02:33:41.18
It's.

2486
02:33:41.18 --> 02:33:42.18
Anyway, there's the high quality ones.

2487
02:33:42.18 --> 02:33:45.18
They're not the ballpark giveaway shirts.

2488
02:33:45.18 --> 02:33:46.18
You know, probably.

2489
02:33:46.18 --> 02:33:47.18
Yeah.

2490
02:33:47.18 --> 02:33:48.18
Yeah.

2491
02:33:48.18 --> 02:33:49.18
You know, there you go.

2492
02:33:49.18 --> 02:33:50.18
Jacco store dot com.

2493
02:33:50.18 --> 02:33:52.18
Check them out for yourself.

2494
02:33:52.18 --> 02:33:55.18
And then yeah, there you go.

2495
02:33:55.18 --> 02:34:00.18
Well, also you can support the podcast by reviewing it on iTunes or

2496
02:34:00.18 --> 02:34:03.18
Stitcher or Google Play or whatever you listen to it on.

2497
02:34:03.18 --> 02:34:06.18
And that helps promote the podcast and spread the word.

2498
02:34:06.18 --> 02:34:08.18
So take a couple minutes and write a review.

2499
02:34:08.18 --> 02:34:09.18
And I read them.

2500
02:34:09.18 --> 02:34:12.18
So say something cool in there.

2501
02:34:12.18 --> 02:34:14.18
Say something cool.

2502
02:34:14.18 --> 02:34:16.18
And then I'll talk about it.

2503
02:34:16.18 --> 02:34:18.18
It'll be in my brain.

2504
02:34:18.18 --> 02:34:20.18
So I like that.

2505
02:34:20.18 --> 02:34:22.18
They don't let you respond to them on iTunes.

2506
02:34:22.18 --> 02:34:24.18
Oh, like I can't say like, hey, man, thanks.

2507
02:34:24.18 --> 02:34:26.18
Yeah, because essentially it's it's a review.

2508
02:34:26.18 --> 02:34:28.18
It's not like a conversation.

2509
02:34:28.18 --> 02:34:29.18
I know, but it should be.

2510
02:34:29.18 --> 02:34:31.18
It should be a conversation.

2511
02:34:31.18 --> 02:34:33.18
So I could be like, hey, man.

2512
02:34:33.18 --> 02:34:34.18
Thanks.

2513
02:34:34.18 --> 02:34:35.18
Yeah.

2514
02:34:35.18 --> 02:34:36.18
So what is that?

2515
02:34:36.18 --> 02:34:37.18
That would be cool.

2516
02:34:37.18 --> 02:34:40.18
Well, but then again, if if people think that you're going to like respond to it,

2517
02:34:40.18 --> 02:34:41.18
they might not get an accurate.

2518
02:34:41.18 --> 02:34:42.18
Oh, that's true.

2519
02:34:42.18 --> 02:34:44.18
Well, if I say something cool, you know what?

2520
02:34:44.18 --> 02:34:45.18
Some people have done.

2521
02:34:45.18 --> 02:34:48.18
They've they've like taken a screenshot of it and then put it on Twitter.

2522
02:34:48.18 --> 02:34:50.18
And that way, I can say, oh, that's cool, man.

2523
02:34:50.18 --> 02:34:51.18
That's awesome.

2524
02:34:51.18 --> 02:34:52.18
That's awesome.

2525
02:34:52.18 --> 02:34:53.18
Appreciate it.

2526
02:34:53.18 --> 02:34:54.18
Or I can say, hey, good point.

2527
02:34:54.18 --> 02:34:57.18
You know, will will will think about that.

2528
02:34:57.18 --> 02:34:58.18
Yeah.

2529
02:34:58.18 --> 02:35:01.18
We'll make some adaptations perhaps.

2530
02:35:01.18 --> 02:35:04.18
But getting the screenshot of their iTunes review, that's a message in

2531
02:35:04.18 --> 02:35:08.18
and of itself that's saying, hey, I put a review on iTunes.

2532
02:35:08.18 --> 02:35:09.18
Yeah.

2533
02:35:09.18 --> 02:35:13.18
It's not necessarily, hey, you know, your the audio is too quiet.

2534
02:35:13.18 --> 02:35:14.18
You know, it's not that.

2535
02:35:14.18 --> 02:35:17.18
If they wanted to tell you that, they tell you that on a Twitter.

2536
02:35:17.18 --> 02:35:18.18
Yeah.

2537
02:35:18.18 --> 02:35:19.18
We'll do it.

2538
02:35:19.18 --> 02:35:22.18
But they'll put their at least their showing.

2539
02:35:22.18 --> 02:35:23.18
Right.

2540
02:35:23.18 --> 02:35:23.18
Right.

2541
02:35:23.18 --> 02:35:24.18
That.

2542
02:35:24.18 --> 02:35:27.18
Hey, this is this is funny because I would like to see like some reviews.

2543
02:35:27.18 --> 02:35:31.18
Like there's some people that write reviews that I laugh at because they're

2544
02:35:31.18 --> 02:35:35.18
fun.

2545
02:35:35.18 --> 02:35:36.18
Yeah.

2546
02:35:36.18 --> 02:35:39.18
They're like, I am definitely getting after it tonight.

2547
02:35:39.18 --> 02:35:40.18
You know what I go.

2548
02:35:40.18 --> 02:35:41.18
That's awesome, right?

2549
02:35:41.18 --> 02:35:42.18
Yeah.

2550
02:35:42.18 --> 02:35:44.18
This guy, this guy talked to all the time.

2551
02:35:44.18 --> 02:35:48.18
Brady, he, he'll like shop at Amazon and he'll be like, click screenshot.

2552
02:35:48.18 --> 02:35:50.18
You know, that's awesome.

2553
02:35:50.18 --> 02:35:51.18
You know, man.

2554
02:35:51.18 --> 02:35:53.18
So that's cool.

2555
02:35:53.18 --> 02:35:55.18
Appreciate that.

2556
02:35:55.18 --> 02:35:58.18
And also, of course, if you want to continue this conversation, like we just talked about or you want to ask questions you want to give us feedback.

2557
02:35:58.18 --> 02:36:02.18
And then you can send us a screenshot of your Amazon purchase.

2558
02:36:02.18 --> 02:36:06.18
Or you just want to kick it with us, then you can find us on the interwebs on Twitter.

2559
02:36:06.18 --> 02:36:11.18
Echo Charles is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink.

2560
02:36:11.18 --> 02:36:16.18
We are also there with Facebook and the Instagram.

2561
02:36:16.18 --> 02:36:19.18
And we do appreciate what you do for us.

2562
02:36:19.18 --> 02:36:25.18
The questions, the support, the comments, the fact that all of you are out there getting better.

2563
02:36:25.18 --> 02:36:32.18
Putting these principles to work on the battlefield in your business and your personal life.

2564
02:36:32.18 --> 02:36:36.18
I've seen a bunch of seal buddies that I have and they're there into it.

2565
02:36:36.18 --> 02:36:39.18
They're listening and they're giving me feedback.

2566
02:36:39.18 --> 02:36:44.18
And that, that is worth everything to me to know.

2567
02:36:44.18 --> 02:36:50.18
And I get a bunch of emails from Marines, from cops, from firefighters that they tell me they are putting this stuff to work.

2568
02:36:50.18 --> 02:36:53.18
I get emails from business people that they're putting this stuff to work.

2569
02:36:53.18 --> 02:36:56.18
And that's what we're doing this for.

2570
02:36:56.18 --> 02:37:02.18
And so that's what inspires me to do this and keep doing this.

2571
02:37:02.18 --> 02:37:17.18
And for me to push myself because you are pushing yourself out there, earning that victory every single day by going out there and getting after it.

2572
02:37:17.18 --> 02:37:24.18
And so, until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.

2573
02:37:24.18 --> 02:37:50.18
Out.
