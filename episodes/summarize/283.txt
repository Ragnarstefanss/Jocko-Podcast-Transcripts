you know did Jason Gardner tell that story on the podcast where the guy they were doing a debrief they're doing a debrief so Jason Gardner's like at T5 and they're doing a debrief after like a CQC kill house run or something and this young officer standing there during the debrief and he just cracks off a round like during the debrief supposed to be cleared safe he cracks off around it goes between two of the guys they're standing in a circle and he cracks off around and the dude had like an out of body experience and he looks up at the group and he says he was decarking it he says he was decarking it as if it was him that's one of my favorites stories from Gardner dude because that tells you how people get crazy they they do something and they think that it wasn't even there he's making excuse for a person that is someone else he was decarking it so there you go jumping at the sound of every outgoing or incoming artillery shell here's another good one stoner was stoner's tasking it was going through CQC training and this guy threw a crash into a room and it like he threw a crash into the room and then went in the room and then like backed out because he scared the crash because it's something weird like that where the guy was basically scared of the crash and so stoner was watching and so stoner was like they get done with the run and so he was like hey come with me and stoner got like seven crashes in his pocket and he went into like a small closet and he goes and he starts talking to the guy all normal and like like hey you know I just want to talk and as he's pulling the crash out just like undoes it and pulls the pin and just drops it at their feet and continues talking totally normal just like oh man he does that seven times and then at the end of whatever he was saying to me goes hey by the way don't be scared of crashes they're not gonna hurt you oh you're feeling a little like queasy right now feeling some butterflies that's good that's your body putting your blood into your muscles instead of to your stomach it's all good common failings says a successful third army rifle company commander the following failings are common among replacements they must be strictly and promptly eliminated if excessive casualties are to be avoided and combat efficiency obtained lack of ordinary discipline saying yeah instead of saying yes sir jumping at the sound of every outgoing or incoming artillery show we acted like we were like straight up nom like that's in a body like with the guys would show up and sometimes there'd be outgoing artillery from camp or body it's outgoing we like we're all this hard to work that's what's fun with that that's what I was gonna ask like is that a thing because like you know when you first encounter gunfire even if it's like you know the guy next year whatever shooting outgoing you know as we say it can startle you if you don't hear that all the time it's so loud so it was like the team was like kind of known for that like hey buckle up when we kick field goals or puns like this guy's coming so there was time they got to the point where they would stack that side wherever he was which is dangerous to do because you open up the other side for other guys but bro it's that important that's so good that's so good the specialized skill he had developed you know there's something to be said about this concept and specializing and focusing on something I was watching a thing about Wayne Gretzky and when he was like he would sit there and watch hockey games as a kid and while he was watching the hockey game he would trace the puck like with a pen on the on the on like a piece of paper like he draw hockey ring the desserts right that's exactly what happened what the desserts is what discipline go does to energy drinks because let's face it you kind of like the taste of an energy drink you kind of like the fact that it gets you a little amped what you don't like is you crash what you don't like is it's bad for you what you don't like is it you get that freaking jitters and what you don't like is you're giving yourself type two diabetes which also sucks that there's no reason for any that no it's like dessert you know you you you feel like crap after you eat a big whatever if we can horrible dessert filled with sugar you know you just have milk but we want you to destroy any enemy that you find that's two different things that's saying i want you to fight someone and run away from them at the same time a combat patrol executes missions which they which may require fighting to accomplish or to help accomplish every combat patrol secure information as a secondary mission then here's the comment this patrol had been given two primary missions reconnaissance and combat without any indication as to which has priority prioritize next to we need to know what the priority is the directive to destroy any enemy found in the area if taken as the primary mission will preclude successful will preclude successful operation as a reconnaissance patrol the mission should have been either combat with reconnaissance as a secondary mission or reconnaissance alone in which case the patrol would engage in combat only to the extent necessary to complete its reconnaissance mission so think about that when you're assigning someone a mission make sure they understand what the damn mission is and don't assign them two missions that are opposed to each other and when you do assign people two or three missions or tasks or projects make sure they know what the priority mission is what the priority project is the patrol departed out of the outpost at 10 15 leaving a 160 millimeter mortar squad to furnish fire support a rope secured of both banks were used to help put the patrol way across the stream by 11 15 personnel and equipment had crossed and we're waiting for scheduled artillery concentration before moving forward at 11 30 80 rounds of 105 was fired after completion of the artillery fire the patrol reconnoiided along the route to the beach except for the killing of three japs by the rear point no contact was made and the trip was on eventful and I have rank over you doesn't mean you're going to do it especially if it's going to get you killed there's a comment here and in these books they just they the sort of the authority times in the author whoever the author is the the author's chime in and they just write comment and it says comment a leader who is not gained the respect respect and confidence of his men during training has two strikes again and when he against him when he answers combat the element of doubt in the minds of his men may be the difference between success and failure of a mission gaining respect and confidence of your men how do you do that do you that by barking out of no do you that by yelling out of no you do that by listening you do that by treating them with respect here is a definition of discipline says Colonel E. L. Montz and Signal Corps true discipline is voluntary it is based on knowledge region a sense of duty and idealism a good leader develops in his men a cheerful and willing obedience that wants to respond that wants to carry out his orders this kind of discipline will in the end bring combat results as no other kind possibly can we could probably stop right here because everyone thinks when the military talks about discipline they're talking about the what if you can beat your people into submission then you're going to be good to go no that's not the kind of discipline we're talking about cheerful willing obedience that's a totally different thing willing obedience people want to carry out the orders you know totally different you don't really think of discipline associated with cheerful so I was like thinking that's freaking that's like a double double bonus scenario not only is this due down with natees which is fully approved dude he's also down with the cause which kind of tells me we're aligned with the whole like that tells me we're aligned like we we we got people you know like we're just aligned that is good and uh what did you say anything to him I just gave the bone of the ball not gave him a little bit more than that all that I was like okay then it goes into the right kind of orientation poor orientation of replacements may seriously affect the fighting ability and survival chances of men themselves and may also endanger the unit with whom they first serve for these reasons that leaders of putoan squads and companies should find out exactly what orientation and training have been given the men and should provide essential orientation on the spot in so far as practical before sending them into combat if a divisional training plan similar to that describe below is in operation the problem of inducting new members new men into smaller units is much simplified and lower unit orientation can be modified accordingly then there's an effective an effective training system described our division has received thousands of replacements since it first since it's first combat experience enormity more than 90% of these replacements have been infantry many of the replacements came into the division lacking confidence in their ability and paralyzed by the apprehension and gendered by loose talk before and upon their rival exact guys are scared shitless sometime ago we started a course of instruction for our replacements they last two and a half days and is conducted by battle experienced personnel particular emphasis is placed upon how to live in a foxhole development of an aggressive attitude the use of fragmentation grenade anti-takernade and bazooka throughout the course these men are trained in groups of 12 they are later assigned to organizations by these same groups you know what I'll tell people about is it close out here by saying we we found that this course of instruction gives replacements much greater self confidence it debunks the notions that they have picked up in the rear the course has definitely improved not only the morale but also the fighting ability of our replacements who expect to continue the plan for all replacements to come into the division you know what else you gotta tell people is like route k they take in route l one element takes out route and another element takes out so there's a lot going on in this in this patrol and I don't want to get too wrapped around trying to explain like exactly what happened without the visuals but the patrol consisted of a rifle between reinforced by two sixty millimeter mortar squads one intelligence man a radio operator an eight man second lieutenant why the platoon leader was in command first lieutenant x from wise company was attached to the patrol as observer and coordinator comment the higher commander keeps the accomplishment of the mission in mind when he selects the patrol leader the more important the mission the more careful his selection must be a good leader should have judgment initiative courage endurance and be a highly skilled leader the attachment of lieutenant x as coordinator not only divided responsibility but also indicated a doubt in the commander's mind as to wise ability to lead the patrol so you've got you've got this second lieutenant that's going out there in command and he just became a rifleman went out there and saved his guys next section's called patrol pointers commanders and staffs as well as troops should be made to realize the amount of detail essential to proper preparation of a patrol for each mission and precise the fact that the patrol leader must be given the means to end time to accomplish his mission how often do we actually think about what where it's tasking people with you got to realize what you're asking people with what time it's going to take how much time they need to prepare for contact with the main force leaders of flank and security or security patrols should be impressed with the importance of maintaining contact with the main force at all times loss of contact has often proved disastrous so you have to maintain communications the opposite extreme there we got a little dichotomy going here the opposite extreme however can also have serious results one patrol leader over zealous about maintaining contact cause the attack to involve the main body and develop into a major action for which the latter was not prepared so this guy kept everyone so close that by the time they did the assault the main body got caught up in the assault as well and you do not want to split forces in the first place and you definitely want to split forces into three groups and you definitely don't want to split forces into three groups and you all wounded and you've already been attacked by a fifty man enemy force this is crazy the comment the patrol must be directed regulated and controlled at all times patrol members must be familiar with all prescribed signals the leader may arrange for a few additional signals for special purposes in this instance and in this instance the loss of control can undoubtedly be attributed to the poor chain of command in the patrol organization to sudden change in command from lieutenant y to lieutenant ex while the patrol is in and contact with the enemy and to a failure to reach clear understanding of plans and signals you can see how these little compounding problems and if you look at your organization if you look at what you're doing inside of your business what little what little mistakes are you making what little what little things are you compounding what problems do you have that can be compounding that can lead to disaster is it communication is it chain of command are you not mutually supporting each other do people not understand what the mission is you see this applies to everything that we do with any kind of team the trip back the platoon sergeant with his 13 men followed the route yeah you like the I like the name too here's the thing about the shirt locker for people because people people are saying hey like can I get that one design those like two months ago it's a good design for sure we can't that was like if you have the membership you'll get the design for that month
