They're going to come to you way more likely, you know, you know, we talk about inoculation when it comes to training for combat and, you know, you, you, you, anoculate yourself to stress and, and one of the things I talk about like with self defense for, especially for women is if you train your jitter, you get a little bit of a bit of anoculated to the fact that someone's going to be grabbing you touching you grind it on units and so you're over that you're over that, but it seems like this is the same situation you do with kids. But you know people always want to know because there's a lot of young military families out there and you know I'm going to I'm going to say this right now I'm going to talk about military families and. You were probably thinking that they would have to make a choice between you and this guy, you know, maybe in your mind that's the best friend, you know, now you got to convince people and you just, you know, you don't know anything. I know, I know with my kids, you know, if they do something that they think is going to get him in trouble, especially in that five, six year old, seven year old, they're not going to tell you. So like, something like this, that's going to turn you into, you know, the person who's, you know, it's kind of like the leader. My seven year old dad dad told you know, so I think that's another thing is how do you make sure that they realize that you're going to be, you know, without blowing it out of proportion, which, which I agree with you know, it's a five year old kid. And when I got back, when I was there, I was thinking, man, I wish I would have brought my guitar because, you know, I had some time, you know, I could have probably played guitar for, you know, half hour a day, maybe 45 minutes, a couple of the guys would have brought there guitar, we could add some little jam sessions, right? I changed the diaper last time, you know, but if you notice, you're talking about yourself not the diaper got to get changed regardless, but you're like focusing on the fact that you had to do it, you know, kind of think. You know, they get little like, like, like, crown gold kind of crumbs, right? You know, I got to be like people have said, you know, I always say, well, people have been asking me this one person. What would plant that in your mind, you know, to make you think that it's going on from your parents perspective, you know, it's like me looking at one of my close friends. You know, obviously without asking leading questions, you know, that's going to make put somebody, you know, in another weird situation. And so that was, that was a little challenging itself to be trying to like get this farm up and going and being, you know, in the beginning you talked about me being like nine months pregnant out there working. And also just normal you know hard working Americans men and women you know you've got someone that's working hard and going a lot and dedicating a lot of their jobs so. And, and, you know, next thing you know, as soon as they, you know, help with the groceries, boom, the arms out of the cast and he's, he's abducting them. Because even you as a kid, you don't know how to say no, you don't know how to scream, you don't know how to tell someone to stop. And exactly what you just said, like a couple of things, you know, he said when he, he was talking about when he got home and he got in the car with his wife and his mom, he's in there for 10 minutes. And, you know, of course there's moments where you feel a little bit sorry for yourself and think, gosh, what if something happens, what if he comes home without his legs or with his face, trap and older, something, but, you know, I don't any more of that stuff doesn't get into my head much. So, the less you make it about yourself and more about the mission, the family, whatever it is that you're doing, the stronger you're going to have the capability to be you know, you can like solve the problems and you know, accomplish the mission. But I feel like it's kind of always on my mind because, you know, like, okay, I'm talking to Greg, right? Yeah, I felt like I was a bit distracted, not necessarily here, but just in life, you know, I couldn't like focus on the thing that I need. So, you know, one of the reasons that you're sitting here today, one of the reasons that I know you is that despite all that darkness that you got sucked into, you somehow, in some way, at some point, realized that you were going in the wrong direction and you, and you turned around and started to do. You know, because actually a lot of like being like a strong military wife and all this stuff, even just a normal. So my next deployment, I said to myself, cool, you know, bring a guitar, you know, with time, we're going to work on the riffs, go back to this deployment was to Ramadi. It's like that, you know, the boy or frog thing, you know, where you're, you just, that's normal to you. You know, one of the, you talk about being independent and I know obviously you're independent person, you can get along by yourself and my wife's the same way, very independent in terms of her day to day, she doesn't just need me to actually do anything for her. Like, people know what you look like. But I do know this your behavior is not going to get help it right the the bottle isn't going to help it the self abuse isn't going to help it the skip in work isn't going to help it. You know, there's, first of all, I can see how 15-year-old Iris, who's dealing with this stuff at home, and meets this guy that's, you know, 31-year-old is, I don't care if he's a total idiot.
