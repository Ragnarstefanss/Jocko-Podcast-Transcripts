00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.60
This is Jockelpontcast number 142 with echo Charles and me, Jockelwillink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.48 --> 00:00:18.56
SLA Marshall could be a bragher of the first order. I could write on toilet paper with a crayon and

3
00:00:18.56 --> 00:00:24.56
cellet was a routine boast, but his favorite claim to fame was at first the most puzzling to me.

4
00:00:24.56 --> 00:00:30.48
Years later the most significant in terms of unraveling the hustler and the phony that he was,

5
00:00:30.48 --> 00:00:36.96
and how he was nonetheless able to make such a mark on the US Army. SLAAM regularly brought

6
00:00:36.96 --> 00:00:42.08
up the fact that the army had made him a general despite his never having attended even one military

7
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:48.32
school and that he was the only general in the army to have this distinction. He neglected to say

8
00:00:48.32 --> 00:00:54.64
and never would have had a not followed up out of sheer curiosity that he'd gotten his star not

9
00:00:54.64 --> 00:01:00.80
in the regular army, but in the reserves. Meanwhile, with no reason not to believe him, I accepted

10
00:01:00.80 --> 00:01:07.84
SLAAM's story of World War I. His experiences as an infantryman in all the major campaigns,

11
00:01:07.84 --> 00:01:12.48
his battlefield commission to become the youngest second lieutenant in the US Army during the war,

12
00:01:12.48 --> 00:01:18.32
the romantic tale he spun of armistice day when he saw in the end of the war sharing his

13
00:01:18.32 --> 00:01:24.16
canteens with his brigade commander in the trenches. With no reason not to believe him,

14
00:01:24.16 --> 00:01:29.44
I accepted SLAAM's tales of World War II, too. His participation in the fighting in the Pacific,

15
00:01:29.44 --> 00:01:35.20
as well as his service in Europe, which had him in the front line of the Normandy invasion.

16
00:01:35.20 --> 00:01:42.80
It would be many, many, many years in which SLAAM repeated the stories endlessly in which his

17
00:01:42.80 --> 00:01:48.40
reputation was only further bolstered as one or the other appeared in everything from current

18
00:01:48.40 --> 00:01:56.08
biography 1953 to the obituary upon his death in 1977, and in his autobiography published two

19
00:01:56.08 --> 00:02:03.04
years later before I would discover it was all a lie. SLAAM had been an enlisted man

20
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:10.24
with the 315th engineers, 90th infantry division during World War I, and spent his time not fighting

21
00:02:10.24 --> 00:02:17.68
as an infantryman, but repairing French road roads until just before the wars end. He had not

22
00:02:17.68 --> 00:02:23.28
been battlefield commissioned, and he wasn't anywhere near the trenches on 11 November 1918,

23
00:02:23.28 --> 00:02:29.60
in being instead at the Army, France based officer candidate school, then called infantry

24
00:02:29.60 --> 00:02:35.04
candidate school, the self-proclaimed youngest lieutenant in World War I who, in fact, never served

25
00:02:35.68 --> 00:02:42.64
an officer in any outfit regular or reserved in any capacity ever was not commissioned until April

26
00:02:42.64 --> 00:02:49.52
1919 long after the last angry shots were fired. According to his service record,

27
00:02:49.52 --> 00:02:55.76
SLAAM saw no infantry combat in World War II, either, although he was awarded a CIB for the

28
00:02:55.76 --> 00:03:01.76
Marshall Islands campaign while serving on the DA staff, and far from being on the ground from

29
00:03:01.76 --> 00:03:08.72
the earliest hours of the 6 June 1944 Normandy invasion, SLAAM didn't even arrive in the European

30
00:03:08.72 --> 00:03:15.84
Thirit Theatre until July, and then it was as a staff officer slash historian reconstructing

31
00:03:15.84 --> 00:03:21.04
the operation, and while SLAAM would speak with pride of being the only American soldier to serve

32
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:28.72
in all four of America's great wars in the 20th century. It was a claim more than a little deceptive.

33
00:03:28.72 --> 00:03:34.64
His Korean war experience covered exactly three months, December of 1950 to February 1951,

34
00:03:34.64 --> 00:03:41.60
when he was recalled from the reserve to active duty as a historian slash operations analysis

35
00:03:41.60 --> 00:03:47.52
for the 8th Army, a stint for his country that produced the river and the gauntlet for himself,

36
00:03:47.52 --> 00:03:54.16
and his service in Vietnam was undertaken as a six-year retire reserve general and a 40-year

37
00:03:54.16 --> 00:04:00.88
experienced journalist. SLAAM's job when he wasn't wearing a khaki, looking for a story on the Army's

38
00:04:00.88 --> 00:04:08.24
tab. A historian as careless with his own history as SLAAM Marshall was could hardly be a careful

39
00:04:08.24 --> 00:04:15.76
historian and Marshall proved the rule. Veterans of many of the actions he documented in his books

40
00:04:15.76 --> 00:04:20.88
have complained bitterly over the years of the inaccuracy or blatant bias.

41
00:04:22.96 --> 00:04:29.44
With it although the truth was that SLAAM was a fallen and irrevocably smashed idol in my eyes.

42
00:04:29.44 --> 00:04:34.96
He knew I'd grown away from him throughout our time together, but it was not something to discuss.

43
00:04:34.96 --> 00:04:41.44
I cherished my career too much to risk getting on his bad side, and I was opportunistic enough

44
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:47.36
to see the value of my staying on the good side. But there must have been many like me,

45
00:04:47.36 --> 00:04:54.56
whose silence in the face of SLAAM's power only added to it and gave credence to his dubious expertise,

46
00:04:54.56 --> 00:05:00.32
who allowed him to have an observed amount of influence which fed his ego and lined his purse.

47
00:05:00.32 --> 00:05:07.36
And for years did an incalculable horrific disservice to the Army, the thing he professed to love

48
00:05:07.36 --> 00:05:12.72
above all, not to mention to the nation and to the men who fought and died in Vietnam.

49
00:05:14.16 --> 00:05:20.24
When General Johnson had warned me to take care with SLAAM, he is the Army's powerful friend,

50
00:05:20.24 --> 00:05:26.32
but he can be a treacherous enemy. I had not understood what he meant. But when I finally did,

51
00:05:26.32 --> 00:05:32.96
I understood too that the Chief of Staff had gotten it backwards. The reality was that SLAAM Marshall

52
00:05:32.96 --> 00:05:40.40
was the Army's powerful enemy because he was its most treacherous friend. And if he were alive

53
00:05:40.40 --> 00:05:47.68
today, perhaps even more than the Vietnam-era generals who determinedly maintained we won the war,

54
00:05:47.68 --> 00:05:53.84
we lost in their hands. SLAAM Marshall would have plenty to answer for.

55
00:05:53.84 --> 00:06:03.52
That right there is a section from my favorite book about face by Colonel David Hackworth.

56
00:06:03.52 --> 00:06:08.88
And he's talking about his experience with a guy by the name of SLA Marshall,

57
00:06:08.88 --> 00:06:16.64
otherwise known as SLAM, SLAM Marshall. And that's a pretty devastating opening. That's a pretty

58
00:06:16.64 --> 00:06:23.36
devastating opening. You can hear what his career was. So there's a lot of

59
00:06:23.36 --> 00:06:31.68
negativity around SLA Marshall. And for me coming from Hackworth, that's basically all I need to hear.

60
00:06:31.68 --> 00:06:39.68
That's all I need to hear is when Hackworth goes and so Hackworth works with him and did a

61
00:06:39.68 --> 00:06:44.56
torn Vietnam with him, they were going around documenting things and he got to know him. And at

62
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:51.36
first he kind of idolized him and he'll talk about that a little bit. But that's one of the things

63
00:06:51.36 --> 00:07:00.96
that Hack mentions in about face was that he had this huge impact on the army. And

64
00:07:00.96 --> 00:07:05.36
Hack says that he used to read his books over and over again. And so it's kind of a weird

65
00:07:05.36 --> 00:07:13.04
dichotomy there is that Hack got information from some of SLA Marshall's famous books that he wrote

66
00:07:13.04 --> 00:07:24.16
about combat. But then he turned out to not have told the truth. So one of the books that

67
00:07:24.96 --> 00:07:30.08
he talks about that he read a bunch is a book called Men Against Fire. And it's based on his

68
00:07:30.08 --> 00:07:35.76
interviews and reporting on World War II. And that book made some claims. And some of the claims

69
00:07:35.76 --> 00:07:44.96
that the book made are just patently untrue. Just law there. Just not true. And the biggest of the lies.

70
00:07:46.64 --> 00:07:52.08
Is that right to call the light? The biggest of the claims. Maybe it's a lie. The biggest of the

71
00:07:52.08 --> 00:07:58.56
untruths will call it that. The biggest of the untruths revolves around this notion that SLA

72
00:07:58.56 --> 00:08:06.64
Marshall presents that in combat only about 15% of the soldiers on the battlefield in combat actually

73
00:08:06.64 --> 00:08:18.40
fires a weapons at all. 15%. Now that's a really strange thing to say. Now and knowing what I know

74
00:08:18.40 --> 00:08:24.48
now I think he may have done that for a couple of reasons. And I'm not making excuses. I'm saying

75
00:08:24.48 --> 00:08:30.08
this is why I think he would do that because there's no excuse for doing this. The first is I think he

76
00:08:30.08 --> 00:08:37.44
wanted to have a theory or a hypothesis that was like kind of shocking and would gain him

77
00:08:37.44 --> 00:08:42.08
simplicity. Right? That's a shocking thing. When you hear hey in combat only 15% of people fire

78
00:08:42.08 --> 00:08:47.68
their weapons. Right? You're going, what are you talking about? That's crazy. So I think he wanted

79
00:08:47.68 --> 00:08:52.64
to have something to discuss that would bring him out to the limelight. You know, the shocking

80
00:08:52.64 --> 00:09:02.72
claim. And second, I think he saw that there was an actual problem. Right? That maybe not as many people

81
00:09:02.72 --> 00:09:10.72
shot their weapons in combat as should. And he wanted to fix that problem. So it was at 85% of the

82
00:09:10.72 --> 00:09:15.76
people that weren't shooting the weapon? No. But maybe the number was a decent percentage that

83
00:09:15.76 --> 00:09:19.76
didn't shoot or could have shot more. Is that possible? Yeah, I could say that that's possible. Maybe

84
00:09:19.76 --> 00:09:29.04
not as many people were, not as many people were shooting as you would have liked. So that's why I

85
00:09:29.04 --> 00:09:34.08
think he got focused on that particular subject. And I think the normal human life things, right?

86
00:09:34.08 --> 00:09:38.40
I think he had a big ego, which actually I don't think he did. He had a big ego. He was insecure.

87
00:09:39.44 --> 00:09:44.48
I think he made up some of these other stories, which are horrible to make up stories about

88
00:09:44.48 --> 00:09:49.12
your combat experiences. It's a big mistake. I think this is, you know, in many ways, this is like

89
00:09:49.12 --> 00:09:54.08
one of the first documented cases of stolen valor, right? And obviously I don't like stolen valor.

90
00:09:54.88 --> 00:10:00.56
So there's a lot of negativity around SLA Marshall. And I have to be careful because

91
00:10:02.40 --> 00:10:08.32
I, it's very easy for me to throw the baby out with the bath water, right? And when you,

92
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.28
you know, okay, so I'm here to learn, right? And despite these very, very significant

93
00:10:17.28 --> 00:10:24.48
character shortfalls, here's the facts, the books that hero guided the military and had a significant

94
00:10:24.48 --> 00:10:32.88
impact on military leaders for many years, including hackworth, including hackworth. So

95
00:10:34.56 --> 00:10:44.24
eventually I had to look and see what is in these books and what if anything I could learn from the

96
00:10:44.24 --> 00:10:52.08
books? And I think, from my perspective, okay, so he did massive amounts of interviews with people.

97
00:10:52.64 --> 00:10:59.12
And he did have, you know, he was, okay, he was an indie day. He was there a month later,

98
00:10:59.12 --> 00:11:04.32
interviewing people, finding out what happened. So he talked to a lot of people. And I think his

99
00:11:04.32 --> 00:11:09.12
perspective and same thing with World War I, he wasn't there, but he was close to it. And he

100
00:11:09.12 --> 00:11:13.20
talked to a lot of people. And then he spent his time in the Pacific theater and he spent time

101
00:11:13.20 --> 00:11:17.60
in Korea. So he had perspective. It's not the perspective that he claimed to have. And if he would have

102
00:11:17.60 --> 00:11:20.96
been smart and just said, look, I wasn't on the front lines, but I talked to a lot of people.

103
00:11:20.96 --> 00:11:25.12
I have, I wasn't a military, I have a good perspective. Here's what I've learned. If you were to

104
00:11:25.12 --> 00:11:32.08
said that, it would have been fine. Unfortunately, he didn't say that. Do we throw the baby out with

105
00:11:32.08 --> 00:11:41.20
the bath water? The, the, my initial, like, gut reaction is yes, flyer, right? Right? Hey,

106
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:48.08
no, I'm not going to listen this guy. But I have to think about it. If this book influenced the military

107
00:11:48.08 --> 00:11:52.56
so much and this book in particular with the book is, is men against fire is the big book that he wrote.

108
00:11:52.56 --> 00:11:57.20
I say the big book, it's the book that he wrote after World War II. I think it came out in 1947.

109
00:11:58.24 --> 00:12:05.60
And it's, it had a big influence. And I can tell you that I had a big influence. It had a big

110
00:12:05.60 --> 00:12:11.36
influence. And this is what's funny. It had a big influence because despite so I guess the facts about his

111
00:12:11.36 --> 00:12:17.60
career came out after he died. He died in 1977 and the facts came out some years after that, right?

112
00:12:18.80 --> 00:12:25.52
I would hear quotes from SLA Marshall all the time when I was in. This guy is a known liar.

113
00:12:29.36 --> 00:12:34.24
Again, maybe that's a harsh word, but he did not tell the truth. And you know, when it comes to

114
00:12:34.24 --> 00:12:40.40
like making up what you did in combat, you kind of kind of earned yourself the the name liar.

115
00:12:40.40 --> 00:12:49.20
So the guy lied. And yet I would hear quotes from what he said and what he taught and what he

116
00:12:49.20 --> 00:12:58.40
thought and a lot of it made sense, right? So okay, is it true that a even a broken clock is right

117
00:12:58.40 --> 00:13:05.68
twice a day? That's still a pretty small percentage. But I'd hear quotes from SLA Marshall that

118
00:13:05.68 --> 00:13:11.84
were correct. And it wasn't a small number of quotes. And so I think despite his ego, despite his

119
00:13:11.84 --> 00:13:17.92
lying, he had a lot of good, he had gathered a lot of good information and talked to enough people

120
00:13:17.92 --> 00:13:21.68
that he actually started to make sense and he saw people in multiple different wars. Again,

121
00:13:21.68 --> 00:13:26.64
did he see it to the degree that he claimed to? No. But you know, there's, there's a lot of

122
00:13:26.64 --> 00:13:31.28
military historians that were never in any kind of combat whatsoever. That were never even in the

123
00:13:31.28 --> 00:13:38.96
military. There's there's plenty of very respected. I've got books in the queue and I don't know if

124
00:13:38.96 --> 00:13:42.88
I'll ever cover them, but I've got books in the queue that are great books about war and about the

125
00:13:42.88 --> 00:13:46.88
military that were written by people that were never in the military. There's military theorists that

126
00:13:46.88 --> 00:13:54.80
were never in the military that I have a great deal of respect for. So then that they say sensible things.

127
00:13:54.80 --> 00:13:59.04
So is there a question of character? Yes, are we going to throw the baby out of the bath water?

128
00:13:59.04 --> 00:14:04.40
I'm going to try not to. I'm going to try and see what we can learn. And I think from when I read

129
00:14:05.52 --> 00:14:08.56
this book, and I read this book a long time ago and I don't know

130
00:14:11.68 --> 00:14:17.68
anyways, I got stuff out of it. And I think there's actually, I'm going to tell you, I think there's

131
00:14:17.68 --> 00:14:21.76
actually a lot to get out of this book. And if nothing else, it reflects

132
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:27.04
and reinforces some lessons and brings some other ones. We paint them a little bit more clearly.

133
00:14:27.84 --> 00:14:34.48
So without further ado, and I found myself as I was reviewing this book again,

134
00:14:35.52 --> 00:14:38.56
like about halfway through it, I totally forgot that it was this guy that I

135
00:14:39.60 --> 00:14:43.92
consider a liar, right? I got over that, right? Because I'm thinking to have that make sense. Yes,

136
00:14:43.92 --> 00:14:49.28
that does that. And he's pulling in quotes from military leaders. And yeah, yeah, that's

137
00:14:49.28 --> 00:14:53.60
are you with me? I mean, doesn't make sense? It makes 100% sense because remember back in the day,

138
00:14:53.60 --> 00:14:58.80
remember Millie Vanilli? Remember that? Those are that group. Oh, you guys are the two guys. Yes,

139
00:14:58.80 --> 00:15:05.12
so they were liars. Yeah, because in that way, yeah, so it wasn't them singing and all this stuff,

140
00:15:05.12 --> 00:15:08.64
as it turns out, as it turns out, but when they were on the radio and stuff,

141
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:12.80
everyone liked that, you know, blaming on the rain and whatever. Did they,

142
00:15:12.80 --> 00:15:18.16
did they recover? They did not recover from their situation. Negative. And I, SLA Marshall was dead.

143
00:15:18.16 --> 00:15:22.32
Yeah, well, one of the guys committed suicide in Millie Vanilli. He was like, you know,

144
00:15:22.32 --> 00:15:27.12
you got heavy, but nonetheless, the point is, it's like, yeah, it's not them singing it,

145
00:15:27.12 --> 00:15:30.16
you know, their liars are whatever, but the songs were kind of dope. That's the thing.

146
00:15:31.76 --> 00:15:36.64
So, you know, it's one same deal. So I get like Marshall Millie Vanilli. It's same thing. Same

147
00:15:36.64 --> 00:15:40.16
same situation right here. I'm saying, if you put on one of the Vanilli, Millie Vanilli songs

148
00:15:40.16 --> 00:15:45.28
right now, don't bring it right back, you know, the dance or whatever, and you know, it's still good.

149
00:15:45.28 --> 00:15:49.84
It's good. So you had a liard that you take the guys that actually sang it or why don't you teach

150
00:15:49.84 --> 00:15:54.32
those two guys how to sing is that how that are to sing? Yes. So one time, not to go too deep into it,

151
00:15:54.32 --> 00:15:57.52
but they tried to make it was to do a podcast about Millie Vanilli out of here.

152
00:15:57.52 --> 00:16:02.48
They went into it. And they were like, hey, we think you could because they messed up on stage.

153
00:16:02.48 --> 00:16:08.96
Right. That's how they got to taste the skip. Yeah. And well, and so they're like, oh my gosh,

154
00:16:08.96 --> 00:16:12.000
they panic. They ran off stage all the stuff. They could have just been like, yeah, we're lip

155
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.88
syncing for that show. But then I forgot how they handled it. But then people were like, hey,

156
00:16:17.44 --> 00:16:21.60
how long did you take the guy to kill himself? Oh, long time. Here's, you know, they got exposed

157
00:16:21.60 --> 00:16:27.52
and all this stuff. Yeah. But he was just, and so they're like, um, they're like, no, we'll prove it,

158
00:16:27.52 --> 00:16:31.44
you know? And then so the people came in and listened to him like actually singing the thing.

159
00:16:31.44 --> 00:16:35.20
It was like, oh my god, not even close. These guys can't even sing. You know,

160
00:16:36.32 --> 00:16:40.88
it's, you got to tell the truth about what's going on, man. You got to. And that's the thing,

161
00:16:40.88 --> 00:16:45.36
like, just like I said, like, why not just get here that the people who were really saying those songs,

162
00:16:45.36 --> 00:16:50.48
they were older people. They were like old, like 50s or something like that. Like, so they didn't have

163
00:16:50.48 --> 00:16:56.96
the pop culture kind of feel. So they were less marketable. But they did just hire a couple, like,

164
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:03.20
vocalists. I mean, how bad can those guys sing terrible. Oh, the real guys. Oh, man. Yeah, you

165
00:17:03.20 --> 00:17:07.60
can watch the little documentary thing. What I was like, good. And they have thick German accents,

166
00:17:07.60 --> 00:17:13.04
too. That's the thing too. Yeah, they're from Germany. Oh, so it's like it's a night and day. They're different.

167
00:17:13.04 --> 00:17:16.40
And but the real people who sang it, they're like, like I said, like, old, you know, funky,

168
00:17:16.40 --> 00:17:21.76
like kind of jazz type people from what I remember. There is less marco. But just like how you said,

169
00:17:22.64 --> 00:17:26.80
sure they're less marketable. But man, they're putting out some pretty cool songs. I mean,

170
00:17:27.84 --> 00:17:31.76
yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't know. The marketing, I think that's a big part of it. I don't know,

171
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:36.48
man. But I mean, you are right. You know, it's weird. It's also because the stuff that stuff that

172
00:17:36.48 --> 00:17:43.84
S.L.A. Marshall says in this book, he's making, he's making statements that they stand on their own.

173
00:17:43.84 --> 00:17:49.12
You don't need, you know, to be able to say, look, I was here. So therefore what I'm saying,

174
00:17:49.12 --> 00:17:54.40
you should listen to. Like, no, the the value of what you're saying should stand on its own.

175
00:17:54.40 --> 00:17:59.84
He don't need to be, you don't need to be a have some certain experience. You know, it's like

176
00:17:59.84 --> 00:18:05.76
life. And I talk about, and I would say, you can't, if you're trying to prove a tactic to someone,

177
00:18:07.12 --> 00:18:10.80
like if I say, hey, when you get in the situation, here's what you should do. I shouldn't say,

178
00:18:10.80 --> 00:18:16.80
because this is how we did it when I was in Baghdad or when I was in a mod or whatever, or when I was

179
00:18:16.80 --> 00:18:22.48
in nom, like, no, here's the tactic and look at how it performs. Go and do a trial run,

180
00:18:22.48 --> 00:18:26.08
go and do some force on force training. You'll see that the tactic works. And S.L.A.

181
00:18:26.08 --> 00:18:32.88
Marshall, smart guy, great writer, got, you know, could have said, hey, here's these tactics that I

182
00:18:32.88 --> 00:18:37.20
learned from these other people that just got out of it. And that wasn't good. That's a little

183
00:18:37.20 --> 00:18:40.96
even thing, isn't it? Just wasn't good enough for them. Didn't you guys have a name for that

184
00:18:40.96 --> 00:18:47.20
one, someone must let out? Yeah, yeah, we we we we we we we we we just when I was in Baghdad. Yeah,

185
00:18:47.20 --> 00:18:52.40
when I was in Baghdad, like, when I was in Baghdad, we did it like this. Yeah. And you can't stand.

186
00:18:52.40 --> 00:18:56.88
You can't stand on that, right? Is it good to have experience and say, hey, look, when I was in Baghdad,

187
00:18:56.88 --> 00:19:02.56
this is how we did it, perhaps we should try it this way. That's one thing. But to say, when I was in Baghdad,

188
00:19:02.56 --> 00:19:07.76
this is how we did it. So that's how is the best way to do it, which is just not true. It's not true.

189
00:19:07.76 --> 00:19:13.52
Things evolve. The the fundamental principles of combat leadership don't change, but the tactics that

190
00:19:13.52 --> 00:19:17.52
you use can definitely model. You have to modify your tactics. The enemies can modify their

191
00:19:17.52 --> 00:19:24.56
tactics. So you have to adjust as well. And so to rely on your personal experience as how you

192
00:19:24.56 --> 00:19:31.20
bolster your arguments is wrong. It's it's a it's an additive, right? It's it's good to say,

193
00:19:31.20 --> 00:19:37.44
hey, look, I've done this before. And this is a good way. I'm in a ride situation where I was

194
00:19:37.92 --> 00:19:44.64
teaching how to go over the beach with boats, right? And I brought up some things and I said,

195
00:19:44.64 --> 00:19:51.28
hey, look, I've done and I had happened to have done multiple deployments on a ship. And when you're

196
00:19:51.28 --> 00:19:54.88
on a ship, you go over the beach a lot. And going over the beaches, a complicated operation.

197
00:19:54.88 --> 00:19:59.92
I don't care. There's no easy way to do it, man. You got gear that's going to flood out and you

198
00:19:59.92 --> 00:20:04.56
got waves. You got tied. You got surf. You got sand. You got salt water. It's a nightmare. And

199
00:20:04.56 --> 00:20:08.56
that's one of the things that makes the seals good is that we have to do this. So when you go,

200
00:20:08.56 --> 00:20:13.92
you knew insert any other way. It's freaking easy. Like you step off a helicopter. Everything's fine.

201
00:20:13.92 --> 00:20:19.12
You see, you know, you you you you you get dropped out of a vehicle. Everything's fine. You come

202
00:20:19.12 --> 00:20:23.60
over the beach. Everything is a disaster. There's salt everywhere. There's water everywhere. Everything's

203
00:20:23.60 --> 00:20:27.92
flooded and broken and you're freezing cold. It's just sucks. And that's that's our normal mode of

204
00:20:27.92 --> 00:20:33.68
operation is right there. So everything else seems easy. But I had a guy that was saying, don't,

205
00:20:33.68 --> 00:20:45.92
don't ever bring the boats in. And I totally disagreed with that. It was like, well, it you have to

206
00:20:45.92 --> 00:20:49.12
think about what you're going to do. It's basically what I'm saying. You have to think about what you're

207
00:20:49.12 --> 00:20:55.76
going to do. If you can avoid if the boats come in and they flip, it's a real problem. Right. It's a real

208
00:20:55.76 --> 00:21:01.28
problem. If there's a surf, it's a real problem. And you need to have like elements ready to just

209
00:21:01.28 --> 00:21:06.88
handle the boats. Because if something goes wrong, so you can't you have to really think about what you're

210
00:21:06.88 --> 00:21:13.04
doing. Anyways, I almost fell back on the like look, I've done this. I've done over the beach

211
00:21:13.04 --> 00:21:18.40
over and over again. I know the deal. Right. It's like, no, no, actually, because the deal is many times

212
00:21:18.40 --> 00:21:23.52
when you look at the surf and you go, you know what, we need to swim in. It's going to suck,

213
00:21:23.52 --> 00:21:28.88
but we need to swim in because risking the boats going through. And there's two, there's two

214
00:21:28.88 --> 00:21:32.24
things that are pulling at you. The waves are big, right? You're thinking, hey, we better get the boats

215
00:21:32.24 --> 00:21:36.64
to bring us in. That's actually counterintuitive. Because the waves are big, man, you flip a boat over

216
00:21:36.64 --> 00:21:44.08
and you got, you're just a disaster. It's a disaster. So anyways, I almost relied on the, hey,

217
00:21:45.04 --> 00:21:49.12
this is the way we did it. And I've done this a bunch. And it's like, no, that's not merit. You have to

218
00:21:49.12 --> 00:21:52.72
be like, explain, okay, here's what can happen. Here's the problems. And here's, and there's problems for

219
00:21:52.72 --> 00:21:55.92
both of us. There's times where you swim in. There's times where you don't. But you have to understand

220
00:21:55.92 --> 00:22:01.84
why you're making that decision. You can't just blank it a decision. Because it gets sketchy. All right,

221
00:22:01.84 --> 00:22:10.88
anyways, this is a big introduction to SLA Marshall. Here we go. I got to say one more thing.

222
00:22:10.88 --> 00:22:15.20
Bro, and in your life and we've written two books about our experiences. They're not, they're

223
00:22:15.20 --> 00:22:20.32
they've leadership books, but you know, we make it very clear that like, hey, this is our

224
00:22:20.32 --> 00:22:24.16
memory to the best of our ability. But there's some things that you just don't,

225
00:22:24.16 --> 00:22:28.88
you, you, you, if you don't know something, you shouldn't make a claim. But there's something like,

226
00:22:28.88 --> 00:22:35.44
you know, if you were participating in D day, you don't mess up that fact. Like, for me to be like,

227
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:40.24
hey, I, oh, yeah, I was on that mission. And so I'm going to be like, oh, well, actually you weren't.

228
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:46.32
Maybe like, well, when was it? And, well, I did whatever. I was on 100 operations. Oh, I don't know

229
00:22:46.32 --> 00:22:50.000
if it's on that one or that. Well, you know, you know, like, it's understood, right? People make mistakes.

230
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.32
People, your memory, it fades with memory. I think late for night. I mean, we, in both the

231
00:22:54.32 --> 00:22:58.32
intros to extreme ownership and dichotomy leadership, we spelled out, you know, this is to the best of our

232
00:22:58.32 --> 00:23:04.000
memory. This isn't a historical document. And we, you know, at some point, I'm sure we'll go back and

233
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.28
and actually get the dates and explain every single thing that happened by date and who is there

234
00:23:09.28 --> 00:23:14.32
in what experience took place. Like, yeah, that would be good to have. And especially now,

235
00:23:14.32 --> 00:23:21.36
it's probably, it's all unclassified now because it's been a long time. But the kind of errors that he's

236
00:23:21.36 --> 00:23:30.32
making in are like, I was at D-Day or I was in the trenches with my brigade commander on the

237
00:23:30.32 --> 00:23:37.92
day that world war one ended. Like, that's not a small, like your memory is not going to forget that,

238
00:23:37.92 --> 00:23:44.72
right? It's just not going to happen. So, tell the truth. And what sucks is, this is what sucks.

239
00:23:45.36 --> 00:23:51.84
If you don't tell the truth, you discredit everything that you've said that actually is truthful.

240
00:23:51.84 --> 00:23:55.68
That's the problem with this book. That's the problem with this book. Everything that,

241
00:23:55.68 --> 00:23:58.32
it basically, you could take this book and throw it in the garbage can and no one could really

242
00:23:58.32 --> 00:24:01.92
argue with you. Oh, that guy lied about a bunch of stuff. Okay. Well, throw it in the garbage can. I get it.

243
00:24:01.92 --> 00:24:07.76
Yeah. And if it wasn't for the fact that hack actually had learned a ton from this book,

244
00:24:08.32 --> 00:24:14.48
I would be like, well, well, throwing the garbage. But if you learned from it, and then used what

245
00:24:14.48 --> 00:24:19.68
he learned from it to implement in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, it's like, okay, you know what,

246
00:24:19.68 --> 00:24:25.36
I'm going to pay attention to it. That's a rough time. This is a rough time. It took me a long time

247
00:24:25.36 --> 00:24:30.24
to decide to cover this book, actually. Yeah. In that crazy makes sense, though. Totally makes sense.

248
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:34.08
Wait, makes sense that it took a long time and it makes sense that we're here right now with book and hand.

249
00:24:34.08 --> 00:24:37.84
Both. Okay. I mean, more the long time thing. Of course, yeah, you got to consider. Just like that.

250
00:24:37.84 --> 00:24:45.04
Well, there's like a reporter, like a news reporter who's like Sadie was in a helicopter and it got to fire.

251
00:24:45.04 --> 00:24:49.76
And all that was Hillary Clinton. Yeah. Yeah. She took sniper fire coming. Right.

252
00:24:49.76 --> 00:24:53.60
So there was a reporter that did that too. Yeah. It was like a legit reporter. Yeah.

253
00:24:53.60 --> 00:24:57.68
And then he said like he did took all this stuff and they were like, well, I was in the helicopter.

254
00:24:57.68 --> 00:25:03.28
Like two helicopters behind the camera. You know, you know, meanwhile, yes, I'm good stuff.

255
00:25:03.28 --> 00:25:06.80
Yeah. You shouldn't have said that, you know, just like I said, you should. You don't have to say all that.

256
00:25:06.80 --> 00:25:11.20
You know, there's something else that happens. This catches people when it comes to storytelling.

257
00:25:11.84 --> 00:25:18.40
Okay. I'm going to explain this. If I'm telling you a story about something taking place

258
00:25:20.32 --> 00:25:25.36
and I'm not a great storyteller, I want you to feel how I felt.

259
00:25:25.36 --> 00:25:33.84
Hmm. So if I say to you, like, let's say I got a mortar that exploded 50 yards from me.

260
00:25:34.64 --> 00:25:39.36
50 yards. I'm pretty safe. Could I get fractured? I could get fract, but I'm pretty safe.

261
00:25:39.36 --> 00:25:45.76
It's still pretty shocking. Whoa. It's blower. Boom. And when that first mortar hit you, like, oh,

262
00:25:45.76 --> 00:25:52.16
wait, is another mortar going to hit me? What's going on? Well, when I tell you, hey, a mortar hit

263
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:59.04
and hit 50 meters from me, I'm thinking, well, that doesn't really convey how I felt at that moment.

264
00:25:59.04 --> 00:26:03.52
Yeah. So you know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to cut that down with. I had this mortar hit 10

265
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:09.68
meters from me. And now you're thinking, oh, dang. Like, even you, I can see it on your face. You get it now.

266
00:26:09.68 --> 00:26:16.08
So in order for me to try and convey the emotions that I actually felt, people start to adjust.

267
00:26:16.88 --> 00:26:20.64
And you've got to be careful that. I don't think they're doing it intentionally. You know,

268
00:26:20.64 --> 00:26:28.24
I, I just put myself in check. Like, okay, I need to tell a good story, but I need to keep the facts straight.

269
00:26:28.24 --> 00:26:33.92
Yeah. Right. sketchy. Yeah. That's the thing. The facts. So there's a difference between saying,

270
00:26:33.92 --> 00:26:38.16
hey, this was the biggest explosion you'd ever seen in your life. You know, like saying that is

271
00:26:38.16 --> 00:26:44.32
different than like this explosion was literally, you know, 200 feet in there. Right. Right. Like this.

272
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:49.12
Well, you could say, oh, this was a 400 pounds worth of TNT. Yeah, you can't make those facts.

273
00:26:49.12 --> 00:26:53.04
You can't make those facts with it. But hey, something hits 50 meters from you and you never

274
00:26:53.04 --> 00:26:59.84
been ordered before. That will, that is a scary thing. Yeah. It's a scary thing. Do a metaphor, though.

275
00:26:59.84 --> 00:27:04.48
Yes. Yeah. But here's what's here's what's cool. Or here's what you need to, here's what I always

276
00:27:04.48 --> 00:27:09.04
need to remember. When I tell you, I got a mortar that landed 50 meters. Most people are like,

277
00:27:09.04 --> 00:27:15.20
damn, that's scary enough. I don't need to make it more scary. Oh, yeah. Let's just keep it real.

278
00:27:15.20 --> 00:27:20.80
Yeah. You even mentioned the smoke trail behind the mortar when you see it going up to me. That's scary.

279
00:27:20.80 --> 00:27:25.04
Yeah. I don't care how many meters. It's not really smoke. It's, uh, it's like little sparks.

280
00:27:25.04 --> 00:27:29.36
Like a sparkler. Oh, like a trail. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it sounds like too.

281
00:27:29.36 --> 00:27:36.000
It's something that even sounds scary by the way. So um, here we end up. We end up with SLA Marshall's

282
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.64
buck. Lots to learn from it. And yeah. So let's get into it. We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll,

283
00:27:42.64 --> 00:27:49.44
we'll try and take it for what it's worth. Yes, sir. And I believe you're going to find as I was

284
00:27:49.44 --> 00:27:56.40
reviewing this buck. I'm like, yeah, there's so much good information in here. Here we go to the book.

285
00:27:56.40 --> 00:28:01.52
In the early years of World War II was the common practice of public spokesman in the United

286
00:28:01.52 --> 00:28:08.08
States to magnify the role of the machine in war while minimizing the importance of large forces of

287
00:28:08.08 --> 00:28:13.28
well-trained foot soldiers. Hey, World War II. We're just going to win this thing with all these

288
00:28:13.28 --> 00:28:21.04
big machines. We're, we're, we're creating once the total contest between national societies is

289
00:28:21.04 --> 00:28:26.56
predicated. It becomes impossible to write off the ultimate clash between the masses of men

290
00:28:26.56 --> 00:28:33.44
who fight on foot. They are the body of the national defense. There is no other way out.

291
00:28:33.44 --> 00:28:41.28
So the society, which looks for an easier way, is building its hope on sand.

292
00:28:43.04 --> 00:28:46.32
Do you already getting kind of fired up? Because that's real.

293
00:28:49.92 --> 00:28:58.88
Improvisation is the natural order of warfare. The perfect formulas will continue to be found only

294
00:28:58.88 --> 00:29:07.60
on charts. That's good. What's the quote that you clipped out of Dave Burke saying? Good deal.

295
00:29:07.60 --> 00:29:11.92
Yeah, good deal. Saying, you said it at the master. It's not a spreadsheet.

296
00:29:13.12 --> 00:29:16.96
Oh, yeah, this isn't a spreadsheet anymore. This isn't a spreadsheet anymore. And that's kind of

297
00:29:16.96 --> 00:29:22.80
what I, that maybe think of that because leadership is not a spreadsheet. It's not a spreadsheet. It's

298
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:25.76
not a perfect thing that you can just put out in a spreadsheet. Okay, here's the decision. We're

299
00:29:25.76 --> 00:29:30.96
going to make it doesn't work that way. All right, here we go. Getting back to the book. Since

300
00:29:30.96 --> 00:29:35.92
more than a century ago, when the rifle bullet began its reign over the battlefield and soldiers

301
00:29:35.92 --> 00:29:40.80
slowly became aware that the day of close order formations in combat was forever gone,

302
00:29:40.80 --> 00:29:47.36
all military thinkers have pondered the need of a new discipline. It has been generally realized

303
00:29:47.36 --> 00:29:52.88
that fashioning the machine to man's use in battle was but half of the problem. The other half

304
00:29:52.88 --> 00:30:02.08
was conditioning man to the machine. The mechanisms of the new warfare do not set their own efficiency

305
00:30:02.08 --> 00:30:07.68
rate in battle. They are ever at the mercy of training methods, which will stimulate the soldier

306
00:30:07.68 --> 00:30:14.000
to express his intelligence and spirit. The philosophy of discipline has adjusted to changing

307
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.28
conditions. So, think about this. Talk about discipline. The philosophy of discipline has adjusted

308
00:30:19.28 --> 00:30:25.04
to changing conditions. As more and more impact has gone into the hitting power of weapons,

309
00:30:25.04 --> 00:30:29.84
necessitating ever widening deployments of the forces of battle,

310
00:30:31.12 --> 00:30:38.16
keep the quality of the initiative in the individual has become the most praised of the military

311
00:30:38.16 --> 00:30:43.76
virtues. So, as we got these weapons that can shoot and kill more people at greater distances,

312
00:30:43.76 --> 00:30:48.72
people got more spread out. The more spread out, people got, the more it becomes important that you

313
00:30:48.72 --> 00:30:54.96
have initiative. Back to the book, it has been readily seen that the prevailing tactical

314
00:30:54.96 --> 00:31:01.44
conditions increase the problem of unit coherence in combat. This, the only offsets or people are

315
00:31:01.44 --> 00:31:06.32
more spread out, the only offset for this difficulty was to train for a higher degree of

316
00:31:06.32 --> 00:31:11.68
individual courage, comprehension of the situation and self-starting character in the soldier.

317
00:31:12.72 --> 00:31:17.28
So, the more spread out people get, the more you have to rely on these individual soldiers to make

318
00:31:17.28 --> 00:31:22.64
the right decisions out there, it's show initiative. That becomes the new discipline. This is

319
00:31:22.64 --> 00:31:30.32
decentralized command. By the way, from this realization, have come new concepts of discipline,

320
00:31:30.32 --> 00:31:36.32
which have altered nearly all the major aspects of life and of human association within Western

321
00:31:36.32 --> 00:31:42.24
armies. We have continued to grapple with the problem of how to free the mind of man,

322
00:31:42.24 --> 00:31:49.28
how to enlarge his appreciation of his personal worth as a unit in the battle, how to stimulate him

323
00:31:49.28 --> 00:31:55.44
to express his individual power within limits, which are good, which are for the good of all.

324
00:31:58.32 --> 00:32:03.36
How do we free the mind? How do we, and notice this is a little dichotomy here,

325
00:32:03.36 --> 00:32:09.60
free the mind to express the individual power, but here's the dichotomy within limits, which are

326
00:32:09.60 --> 00:32:13.36
for the good of all. So, you can't just be doing what's good for you, you can't just express your

327
00:32:13.36 --> 00:32:17.84
for your mind and do whatever you think is right for your own purpose, you need to do it for everyone,

328
00:32:17.84 --> 00:32:24.32
the good for all. Back to the book, it is universally recognized that as the means of war change

329
00:32:24.32 --> 00:32:30.64
so much the intelligence of man be quick and to keep pace with the changes. Our weakness lies in

330
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:37.44
this that we have never got down to an exact definition of what we are seeking, failing that we fall

331
00:32:37.44 --> 00:32:43.44
short in our attempt to formulate in training how best to obtain it and our philosophy of discipline

332
00:32:43.44 --> 00:32:50.32
falters at the vital point of its practical tactical application. I say that it is a simple thing.

333
00:32:51.04 --> 00:32:59.20
What we need in battle is more and better fire. What we need to seek in training are any

334
00:32:59.20 --> 00:33:04.16
and all means by which we can increase the ratio of effective fire when we have to go to war.

335
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:08.88
The discipline training methods and the personal policies of our forces should all be regulated

336
00:33:08.88 --> 00:33:14.96
to conform with this one fundamental need. Now, you can see what he's getting out here. This is

337
00:33:14.96 --> 00:33:20.80
his big statement. This is his big hypotheses. So, it's actually, he says, I say it's a simple

338
00:33:20.80 --> 00:33:26.64
thing. We need what we need in battle is more and better fire. That's his big statement. I don't

339
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:30.16
agree with that. Like there's other things. There's a lot of other things going on in leadership.

340
00:33:30.16 --> 00:33:34.000
I think actually the things that he talked about prior to this are more important than fire.

341
00:33:35.04 --> 00:33:38.88
Descentralized commanded, making people take initiative and having people step up and do the right

342
00:33:38.88 --> 00:33:44.48
thing for the entire team. But with a free mind making these things happen. And for some reason,

343
00:33:44.48 --> 00:33:48.88
he just bypasses all that super important stuff. It says, hey, no, the most important thing. We need

344
00:33:48.88 --> 00:33:55.04
to be more and better fire. Fire is important. Hell, yes. Fire is important. That's why I love

345
00:33:55.04 --> 00:34:00.72
machine gunners. It's all my machine gunners out there. God bless you. You laid down the fire

346
00:34:00.72 --> 00:34:07.52
to all the supporting fire elements out there. Artillery, close air, love you. Thank you. We need

347
00:34:07.52 --> 00:34:13.84
more fire. I agree with that. But that's not, that's not the, it's not the thing that we narrow

348
00:34:13.84 --> 00:34:20.88
everything down to, which is his hypothesis. So, a lot of good information there. He narrows it down

349
00:34:20.88 --> 00:34:24.48
to a different direction. Don't agree with it. And actually I'll go ahead and say,

350
00:34:24.48 --> 00:34:30.72
not true. It's all these factors that we need to improve. Fire is not the sole thing. Fire is

351
00:34:30.72 --> 00:34:38.000
absolutely important. Fire wins fire fights. Absolutely fire maneuver. Cover, move wins fire

352
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.96
fights. It helps. So, fire helps when fire fights doesn't win it on its own. Next chapter is called

353
00:34:44.96 --> 00:34:52.000
on future war. He says the battlefield is the epitome of war. All else in war, when war is perfectly

354
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.76
conducted exists, but to serve the forces of the battlefield and to assure final success on the field.

355
00:34:57.76 --> 00:35:02.72
It is on the battlefield that the issues of war are decided. Check.

356
00:35:05.52 --> 00:35:12.88
Concure. It should be noted that all military power is dependent on civil will.

357
00:35:14.40 --> 00:35:18.08
It is the nation and not the army, which makes war. So, I've talked about that

358
00:35:18.08 --> 00:35:23.52
before the will. You gotta have the will. If you don't have the will as a nation,

359
00:35:24.40 --> 00:35:28.72
you're not going to win. And if talked about it before, the wills you're going to have to

360
00:35:28.72 --> 00:35:33.12
are the wills to the will to kill and the will to die because that's where war is. It's killing and

361
00:35:33.12 --> 00:35:37.76
die. And if you don't have those, if you don't have the will to do those two things, you should not be

362
00:35:37.76 --> 00:35:46.16
entering war. Because the outcome is not going to be good. Every improvement in weapon power is aimed at

363
00:35:46.16 --> 00:35:51.60
lessening the danger on one side by increasing it on the other. Consequently, every improvement in

364
00:35:51.60 --> 00:35:58.56
weapons is eventually met by a counter improvement. That's the jitsu, right? You get the counter.

365
00:35:58.56 --> 00:36:02.56
Come up for the new move. Guess what? Somebody's going to come up with a move to counter it.

366
00:36:02.56 --> 00:36:09.04
That's always happening with weapons. I like this little line right here. Decision in war is a

367
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:16.96
clenching act. It is the action which finally delivers the victory surely into one's hands. Decision,

368
00:36:16.96 --> 00:36:26.64
decisiveness, making the call. That's what you need to do. Next chapter, man on the battlefield.

369
00:36:28.16 --> 00:36:34.32
On the battlefield, the real enemy is fear and not the bayonet or bullet. All means of union of

370
00:36:34.32 --> 00:36:41.12
power, demand, union of knowledge. That's a quote from Robert Jackson. And he continues here. It is

371
00:36:41.12 --> 00:36:47.04
of the battlefield that I speak in saying that the mind of the infantry soldier should be conditioned

372
00:36:47.04 --> 00:36:52.80
to an understanding of its reality through all stages of his training. And that's one of the reasons

373
00:36:52.80 --> 00:36:57.68
why I heard so many quotes about SLA Marshall is while we were getting trained, people would refer

374
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:03.52
back to SLA Marshall. And when I ran training, I knew I had to bring it up sometimes because I

375
00:37:03.52 --> 00:37:07.44
'd say, look, here's what's going on. We need to think about this. And I'll get to some of

376
00:37:07.44 --> 00:37:13.76
those points later. But training is methodology when he wrote this book, part of the focus is like,

377
00:37:13.76 --> 00:37:20.40
hey, we need to train people differently. And what he says about training is 100% valid, 100% valid.

378
00:37:22.40 --> 00:37:27.76
Back to the book, he needs to be taught the nature of the field as it is in war and as he may

379
00:37:27.76 --> 00:37:32.40
experience it someday. For if he does not acquire a soldier's view of the field, his image of it

380
00:37:32.40 --> 00:37:37.92
will be formed from the reading of novels or the romance written by war correspondence of which he was

381
00:37:37.92 --> 00:37:45.04
won by the way. Or from the viewing of or from viewing the battlefield as it is imagined to be by

382
00:37:45.04 --> 00:37:50.48
Hollywood. One of the purposes of training should be to remove these false ideas of battle from his mind.

383
00:37:50.48 --> 00:37:58.32
Totally agree. Absolutely. To give the soldier a correct concept of battle is a far different thing

384
00:37:58.32 --> 00:38:04.16
from encouraging him to think about war. So think about what I just said. To give the soldier

385
00:38:04.16 --> 00:38:09.28
a correct concept of battle is a far different thing from encouraging him to think about war.

386
00:38:10.24 --> 00:38:15.92
The latter is to vast the canvas. It includes too much detail which is confusing to his mind and

387
00:38:15.92 --> 00:38:20.16
immaterial to his personal problem. Here's like, don't think about this big picture. You need

388
00:38:20.16 --> 00:38:25.04
to think about what's happening. We have surpassed all other armies and outstripped common

389
00:38:25.04 --> 00:38:30.16
sense in our effort to teach man something about war. He's counted about war's causes, which is a

390
00:38:30.16 --> 00:38:34.96
good thing on which those rare occasions when he is when the instruction isn't qualified hands.

391
00:38:34.96 --> 00:38:39.52
He's told about how the soldiers and sailors of other nations observe, currency and foster

392
00:38:39.52 --> 00:38:44.000
tradition. He is even bored by lectures on the strategy and logistics of high command.

393
00:38:44.72 --> 00:38:50.32
But he does not get what he requires most. The simple details of common human experience on the

394
00:38:50.32 --> 00:38:57.20
field of battle. As a result, he goes to the supremely testing experience of his lifetime as it

395
00:38:57.20 --> 00:39:04.88
almost a total stranger. So you learn all the, you know what, actually when life took over the

396
00:39:04.88 --> 00:39:11.28
junior officer's course coming out of buds, it was very focused on the big picture stuff and it

397
00:39:11.28 --> 00:39:16.32
wasn't helping these guys being prepared to be in a seal putton. And life was like, no, I got to

398
00:39:16.32 --> 00:39:21.20
change this. You can still talk about this stuff and it's important to you don't throw it out.

399
00:39:22.08 --> 00:39:28.08
But you got to teach people what the human experience on the battlefield is and that's what

400
00:39:28.08 --> 00:39:31.44
life tried to do and that's what I try to do and I took over training and my training was further

401
00:39:31.44 --> 00:39:37.04
along when I took it over, you know, we already moved in that direction or it already reflected that.

402
00:39:38.08 --> 00:39:42.32
But a lot of the stuff that life was being taught in life's course was not

403
00:39:42.32 --> 00:39:48.32
the human experience on the field of battle. Life tried to get that in there and he did a good

404
00:39:48.32 --> 00:39:53.92
job of it. Back to the book, the price for failure. So the, so you're talking about to train these

405
00:39:53.92 --> 00:39:59.44
people correctly. The price for failure is paid all up and down the line. Men going to action

406
00:39:59.44 --> 00:40:05.20
the first time, haltingly and gropingly as if they were lost at night in the deep woods,

407
00:40:05.20 --> 00:40:10.56
lives are wasted unnecessarily. Time is lost. Ground that might be taken is overlooked.

408
00:40:10.56 --> 00:40:16.32
It is not necessary that these misfortunes before organizations simply because they are new to

409
00:40:16.32 --> 00:40:21.76
battle. It is possible that the infantry soldier can be trained to anticipate fully the true

410
00:40:21.76 --> 00:40:26.72
conditions of the battlefield. It is possible that units can be schooled to take full and prompt

411
00:40:26.72 --> 00:40:32.40
action against this, against the disunifying effect of these conditions. Fear is ever presence.

412
00:40:32.40 --> 00:40:37.68
But the, but it is the uncontrolled fear that is the enemy of successful operation and the control

413
00:40:37.68 --> 00:40:43.20
of fear depends upon the extent to which all dangers and distractions may be correctly anticipated

414
00:40:43.20 --> 00:40:49.04
and therefore understood. You got to simulate battle. That's what you got to do. And they did a great

415
00:40:49.04 --> 00:40:52.32
job when I was going through my workups. They did a great job of doing that. When I took over

416
00:40:52.32 --> 00:40:56.88
and was running training, we brought it even to the next level. It was freaking mayhem out there.

417
00:40:57.68 --> 00:41:01.20
And I had many people. And we're going to have some guys that are retiring in the future

418
00:41:01.20 --> 00:41:06.48
that are coming on the podcast that went through my workups. They will tell you being an actual

419
00:41:06.48 --> 00:41:12.56
cop. That was easier. There was easier. And that's what my goal was. We want this training to be

420
00:41:12.56 --> 00:41:17.04
so chaotic. And what you think about this right here. And you think about law enforcement training.

421
00:41:17.04 --> 00:41:21.68
Should be the same way. You want these guys completely tested. You want it to be harder than

422
00:41:21.68 --> 00:41:24.64
anybody they ever have to deal with. You want the situation to be more stressful than they're

423
00:41:24.64 --> 00:41:30.96
going to deal with in real life. And that's how you get them prepared. Next, the heart of the

424
00:41:30.96 --> 00:41:37.84
matter is to relate to man is to relate the man to his fellow soldier as he will find him on

425
00:41:37.84 --> 00:41:44.32
the field of combat to condition him to human nature. As he will learn to depend on it when the

426
00:41:44.32 --> 00:41:50.16
ground offers him no comfort and weapons fail. He talks a lot about human nature. I talk a lot about

427
00:41:50.16 --> 00:41:58.08
human nature. When you were when you'd hear about this, oh, this guy or the man this one,

428
00:41:58.08 --> 00:42:07.36
did you know that he was a faker back then? It was yes. But it was, you know, there's two sides to

429
00:42:07.36 --> 00:42:13.44
every story. It seemed like to me until I read about face. And I was like, okay, there's the actual

430
00:42:13.44 --> 00:42:18.40
side. There's the actual side. Because, you know, Hackworth said, look, this is what he actually did.

431
00:42:18.40 --> 00:42:22.88
Here's his military records. So, but up until I read about face, it was kind of like, oh,

432
00:42:22.88 --> 00:42:28.16
that's, oh, there's some weird stuff about his career. But you know, yeah, kind of what is a gray area?

433
00:42:31.44 --> 00:42:36.24
But not everyone. Some people would talk about him like he was the man without any

434
00:42:36.24 --> 00:42:41.28
demarits against him, without any question against him. Right. Which kind of adds to the little

435
00:42:41.28 --> 00:42:47.28
hodgepodge opinions? Yeah. That was a crazy thing. I mean, when Hackworth was just talking

436
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:52.96
about opening that I read, this is something that is just what you read it, you go, oh, God. So,

437
00:42:52.96 --> 00:43:01.92
he's saying that, Hackworth is saying that basically he, he, he didn't want to bring up the fact.

438
00:43:01.92 --> 00:43:07.92
He stayed on his good side. Right. Hey, he, value his career. Slam had a lot of power. So,

439
00:43:07.92 --> 00:43:12.24
he's just going to stay on his good side. And then he's saying how many other guys were doing that.

440
00:43:12.24 --> 00:43:18.16
How many guys were just staying on SLA Marshall's good side because they wanted to continue their

441
00:43:18.16 --> 00:43:22.40
career and in order to do that, they're like, oh, you know, I'm not going to say anything about it.

442
00:43:22.40 --> 00:43:26.08
Yeah. And that actually bolsters his power because Hackworth at this time,

443
00:43:26.88 --> 00:43:31.20
right, if you get a blessing from Hackworth, it's like, that's real problem. Remember what,

444
00:43:31.20 --> 00:43:35.84
remember what, Mook, Jim Mook, Yama said about Hackworth? He's like, everybody knew Hackworth.

445
00:43:35.84 --> 00:43:40.24
Everybody knew him. He was Mr. Infantry. Coolest nickname ever about it, right?

446
00:43:40.24 --> 00:43:45.76
Yeah. Sure. If I come back in another world, I'm going to do whatever it takes to earn the

447
00:43:45.76 --> 00:43:53.76
nickname Mr. Infantry. That's just as legit as it gets. So, but when you got Hackworth going, oh,

448
00:43:53.76 --> 00:43:58.64
yep, yeah, I work with Slam. Good guy. Right. That's a little, oh, that's Hackworth saying that. So,

449
00:43:58.64 --> 00:44:02.56
it's, it's like, and now there's other generals are saying this because everybody just wants to

450
00:44:02.56 --> 00:44:06.08
protect a little career. I mean, he's saying he was opportunistic. And this is Hackworth coming out,

451
00:44:06.08 --> 00:44:12.000
straight up calling himself guilty. Yeah. So, do you think this happens all the time though, right?

452
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.80
That's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's all the time. So, do you think that it's kind of in a way you're

453
00:44:16.80 --> 00:44:23.12
duty to kind of to call it out? Okay. There's two ways to answer that question. If you call it out,

454
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.04
and it doesn't work, and you get blacklisted by SLA Marshall. And now you don't make rank,

455
00:44:29.04 --> 00:44:33.12
and now you're not in charge, and they shove you off to some billet over and wherever.

456
00:44:33.12 --> 00:44:37.52
Mm-hmm. And now you have no more influence. Did you do a good job?

457
00:44:38.64 --> 00:44:43.52
Did you make a right call? If you play the game and you just go along with it,

458
00:44:43.92 --> 00:44:47.44
and you try and get yourself to a position of power where you can actually have more influence,

459
00:44:47.44 --> 00:44:52.32
and you would have had, and you had to, you had to bite your tongue. Was that the good move?

460
00:44:53.92 --> 00:44:57.12
But what if you didn't really get to where you wanted to be, and now you accelerated him, and he

461
00:44:57.12 --> 00:45:00.40
turned to get, you know, I mean, that's, that's a very tough decision to make, and that's why

462
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:04.32
that's why you gotta be, that's why you gotta be tactfully, you gotta think about what's going on.

463
00:45:04.32 --> 00:45:07.60
You gotta think about the long-term consequences of what you're about to do. That's why leadership

464
00:45:07.60 --> 00:45:11.12
is challenging. And that's why playing these little political games, which you have to play in every

465
00:45:11.12 --> 00:45:15.84
different organization. People don't think there's political games in the military golf. It's a big political

466
00:45:15.84 --> 00:45:21.68
game. It's a big giant political game. And same thing in companies corporations. That's the way

467
00:45:21.68 --> 00:45:27.12
the world works. You gotta play the game. Yeah. So like even socially, you know, where,

468
00:45:27.12 --> 00:45:31.92
let's say you know a person, and I've been in the situation before, not even necessarily in it.

469
00:45:32.80 --> 00:45:36.96
I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that either, but I'm saying plausible denying,

470
00:45:36.96 --> 00:45:41.76
no, and just came out. They're job-etcrolls. But you know, you know, if somebody who,

471
00:45:42.80 --> 00:45:48.48
there, they're like a complete like faker, dire, and you know, they, they got an orange,

472
00:45:48.48 --> 00:45:52.80
you know, just some same, you know, social scenario where, you know, they have a nice car,

473
00:45:52.80 --> 00:45:58.000
but then they owe like 10 people, like 10s of thousands of dollars because how they screw them over

474
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.20
in something like their friends and all this stuff, right? Yeah. Meanwhile, there's a small group of

475
00:46:03.20 --> 00:46:07.84
people who know all about that stuff. And we see, you know, we'll see, or you'll see this person

476
00:46:07.84 --> 00:46:13.60
as this huge faker going around town as this huge faker. But everyone else who's not in it sees

477
00:46:13.60 --> 00:46:21.52
them as this great person who's like, you know, whatever. Is it your duty on a social level,

478
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:26.80
same same? Like, to be like, hey, because, you know, I guess it could be said like, hey,

479
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:30.48
you're kind of protecting other people from getting screwed in that same way. Yeah, for sure.

480
00:46:31.12 --> 00:46:35.04
But at the same time, it's like, yeah, do you, especially if you don't have a dog in the faker?

481
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:39.20
Actually, look at what, what is this person doing? That's benefiting anyone. If all

482
00:46:39.20 --> 00:46:43.92
they're doing a screw in people over, I'm going to say something for sure. If this person,

483
00:46:43.92 --> 00:46:50.80
if this individual is somehow, you know, running a big charity organization, right? Right? Like,

484
00:46:50.80 --> 00:46:54.96
that's a legit thing, right? That could happen. He's donate money or getting people to donate or

485
00:46:54.96 --> 00:47:02.48
whatever. Maybe I'd try and mitigate it more. But, you know, in a social situation, just first

486
00:47:02.48 --> 00:47:05.44
and just sounds like they're going to screw people over. I think I'm going to, I think I'm going

487
00:47:05.44 --> 00:47:11.68
to drop time. Yeah. Yeah. On one hand, you're kind of like, yeah, let me, let me, and not the kind

488
00:47:11.68 --> 00:47:16.32
you're not going to go on the radio or something and broadcast it. Well, you don't have to go on the

489
00:47:16.32 --> 00:47:20.88
radio or these, right? You don't know, you can go on the social media. No, that's what it mean. But

490
00:47:20.88 --> 00:47:25.76
you're not going to go on and announce these things. It's just like, if it ever comes up. Here's,

491
00:47:25.76 --> 00:47:31.12
you know, here's a situation that could unfold. If you call this person out, now that no,

492
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:35.68
now they stop whatever form of income they have, now no one that they always money to is actually

493
00:47:35.68 --> 00:47:39.76
going to ever get paid back. Right? Isn't that to be problematic? Yeah. Or you now you have like

494
00:47:39.76 --> 00:47:44.80
a little conflict with this person. Now you got to deal with whatever comes of that. Yeah.

495
00:47:44.80 --> 00:47:49.12
Same thing. It's kind of like, don't like what you call, you need, you know, money, the

496
00:47:49.12 --> 00:47:53.60
waters or whatever. Like don't disturb the waters kind of thing. Yeah. And then hopefully,

497
00:47:53.60 --> 00:47:58.96
which usually actually is the case in such an social situation where they're going to play

498
00:47:58.96 --> 00:48:04.24
themselves anyway. So that's true. And that gets out. You can't like, but I don't like people

499
00:48:04.24 --> 00:48:08.80
taking people's money. Yeah. So I'm going to have a problem with this person. Yeah. That's the bottom

500
00:48:08.80 --> 00:48:13.12
line. Yeah. Fully. And I think most people that's how it is, you know, they're like that's all.

501
00:48:13.12 --> 00:48:16.88
And I think the weird thing is social people that don't, they don't, they don't, they don't

502
00:48:16.88 --> 00:48:21.36
be coming around me if they, I kind of give off the vibe of like, hey, you don't want to be

503
00:48:21.36 --> 00:48:26.16
acting that way around me. Yeah. So I don't have a lot of people like that hanging around. Yeah.

504
00:48:27.04 --> 00:48:35.36
There it is. Going back to the book. Only when human, rather than material aspects of

505
00:48:35.36 --> 00:48:40.96
operation are put up or most, can tactical bodies be conditioned to make the most of their potential

506
00:48:40.96 --> 00:48:47.84
unity. So the human being, he's saying that human beings are more important. It is beyond question

507
00:48:47.84 --> 00:48:54.64
that the most serious and repeated breakdowns on the field of combat are caused by failure of controls

508
00:48:55.36 --> 00:49:02.56
over human nature. I'm going to read that again. It is beyond question that the most serious and

509
00:49:02.56 --> 00:49:08.24
repeated breakdowns on the field of combat are caused by failure of the controls over human nature,

510
00:49:08.24 --> 00:49:15.12
not tactics, not weapons, not machinery, not physical strengths, but human nature.

511
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:24.96
And guess what, I agree with that. I agree with that. We all grant that the soldier must be trained

512
00:49:24.96 --> 00:49:32.72
for initiative and encourage to think about what is problem while in combat. So again, he talks about

513
00:49:32.72 --> 00:49:37.92
a lot about initiative and that's one of the things that I think was very positive.

514
00:49:37.92 --> 00:49:43.04
That's one of the things that influenced me knowing that it was important for people to have

515
00:49:43.04 --> 00:49:45.44
initiative and knowing that you can't control whatever you want on the battlefield and

516
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:49.76
understanding decentralized command. Back to the book, our training methods are conditioned by the

517
00:49:49.76 --> 00:49:56.48
ideal of automatic response. So he's saying like we think that the best thing, the best ideal

518
00:49:56.48 --> 00:50:01.28
is just automatic response. That's what we want. At the same time, our observation of the battle

519
00:50:01.28 --> 00:50:08.40
fields reality makes it clear to us that we need men who can think through their situation and steal

520
00:50:08.40 --> 00:50:14.56
themselves for action according to the situation. So we don't want automatic response. We want

521
00:50:14.56 --> 00:50:20.88
people that can think. The thinking soldier, the man who's trained for self-starting, cannot be matured

522
00:50:20.88 --> 00:50:27.76
in a school which holds to the vestiges of the belief that automatic action is the ideal thing

523
00:50:27.76 --> 00:50:37.04
in the soldier. Again, this is undeniable, undeniable. We want people that are think for themselves.

524
00:50:40.16 --> 00:50:45.12
I hold it to be one of the simplest truths of war that the thing which enables an infantry soldier

525
00:50:45.12 --> 00:50:50.72
to keep going with his weapons is the near presence or the presumed presence of a combat.

526
00:50:50.72 --> 00:50:58.32
It happened too frequently in our army that a line company was careless about the manner in which

527
00:50:58.32 --> 00:51:03.36
it was received a new replacement. The stranger was not introduced to his superiors,

528
00:51:03.36 --> 00:51:08.000
nor was there time for him to feel the friendly interest of his immediate associates before

529
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.52
he was ordered forward with the attack. The result was the man's total failure in battle and

530
00:51:13.52 --> 00:51:20.64
has returned to the rear as a mental case. So it is far more than a question of the soldier's

531
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:26.88
need of physical support from other men. He must have at least some feeling of spiritual unity

532
00:51:26.88 --> 00:51:32.64
with them if he is to do an efficient job of moving and fighting. This is very important. I work

533
00:51:32.64 --> 00:51:39.92
with companies all the time. So you take a army unit and you throw a random guy in there, a random

534
00:51:39.92 --> 00:51:43.28
replacement and no one meets him and no one talks to him and also they're going on and attack. He's

535
00:51:43.28 --> 00:51:47.84
going to fail. That's the statement because he doesn't under he doesn't know anyone else and he

536
00:51:47.84 --> 00:51:52.56
goes more into detail in the in the book. But that happens with companies where they have some

537
00:51:52.56 --> 00:51:57.28
new new person check on board they get hired they check on board, no one meets him, no one greets him,

538
00:51:57.28 --> 00:52:01.28
no one becomes friends with them, they're in their own isolated little world, the pressure starts to

539
00:52:01.28 --> 00:52:08.16
come and they bail or they break. He talks more about this in chapter four which is called combat

540
00:52:08.16 --> 00:52:13.92
isolation and there's a quote that it starts off from major general Charles W. O. Daniel and it says,

541
00:52:13.92 --> 00:52:23.36
the finest theories in most my new plans often crumble. Complex systems fall by the wayside

542
00:52:24.24 --> 00:52:33.12
parade ground formations disappear are splendidly trained leaders vanish. The good men which we

543
00:52:33.12 --> 00:52:45.52
had at the beginning are gone. The raw truth is before us. That's good. Yeah and obviously

544
00:52:46.40 --> 00:52:51.76
law of combat number two keep things simple. That's exactly what he's talking about. You got to keep

545
00:52:51.76 --> 00:52:56.72
things simple but he's also saying that everything that you come up with these complex things they're

546
00:52:56.72 --> 00:53:02.72
going to fall apart and combat. That's what happens. And now we talk about the name of the

547
00:53:02.72 --> 00:53:09.76
chapters combat isolation and he starts talking about what it's like when these soldiers get on the

548
00:53:09.76 --> 00:53:16.000
battlefield he's talking about the battlefield's cold and it's harsh and it's empty and there's it's

549
00:53:16.56 --> 00:53:22.32
chills a man's soul is what he's saying and then when the fire starts here we go back to the

550
00:53:22.32 --> 00:53:27.84
book he finds himself suddenly almost alone in his hour of greatest danger and he can feel the

551
00:53:27.84 --> 00:53:33.04
danger but there is nothing out there, nothing to contend against. It is from the mixture of

552
00:53:33.04 --> 00:53:39.68
mystification and fear that there comes the feeling of helplessness which in turn produces greater fear.

553
00:53:41.04 --> 00:53:46.000
That is what green troops are up against. Time and again I have heard them say after their first

554
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
triacombat by God there was never a situation like it. We saw no one we were fighting phantoms

555
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:59.20
and as frequently they have and as frequently they have added this though their convictions about

556
00:53:59.20 --> 00:54:05.12
the matter were holy at odds with the fact of the situation we had to do it all alone we got no

557
00:54:05.12 --> 00:54:12.08
support on either flank. So he's talking about the fact that we you feel alone on the battlefield

558
00:54:12.88 --> 00:54:19.12
and the fact that guys would come back and say even though they were fully supported it didn't matter

559
00:54:19.12 --> 00:54:25.36
they thought they were alone out there and that's what he's talking about he goes on. The enemy

560
00:54:25.36 --> 00:54:30.08
now he's talking about fire fights situation the enemy fire builds up it's aim becomes true

561
00:54:30.08 --> 00:54:35.52
or the man spread the men spread further and further from each other moving individually to whatever

562
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:41.84
cover is nearest or forwards the best protection a few of them fire their pieces at first they do so

563
00:54:42.40 --> 00:54:47.28
almost timidly as if fearing a rebuk for wasting ammunition when they do not see the enemy.

564
00:54:47.28 --> 00:54:52.000
Others do nothing some fail to act mainly because they are puzzled what to do and their leaders do

565
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.24
not tell them. Others are wholly unnerved and can either think nor move in sensible relation to

566
00:54:58.24 --> 00:55:04.16
the situation such response as the men make of two enemy fire tends mainly to produce greater

567
00:55:04.16 --> 00:55:09.28
separation in the elements of the company thereby intensifying the in-tenceifying the feeling

568
00:55:09.28 --> 00:55:16.08
of isolation and the insecurity of its individuals. The junior leaders are affected as much as

569
00:55:16.08 --> 00:55:26.64
the rifle files. So when chaos starts people start to be alone again this can apply the battlefield

570
00:55:26.64 --> 00:55:30.08
this can apply the business world when chaos starts people start to focus on their own little

571
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:36.48
world and the more you focus on your own little world the more separation there is the less

572
00:55:36.48 --> 00:55:41.76
unity there is in your unit to make something happen now he goes on back to the book could one

573
00:55:41.76 --> 00:55:47.60
clear commanding voice be raised even though it be the voice of an individual without

574
00:55:47.60 --> 00:55:54.96
titular authority they would obey or at least the stronger characters would do would do so

575
00:55:54.96 --> 00:56:03.04
and the weaker would begin to take heart because something is being done. I got to see this over

576
00:56:03.04 --> 00:56:07.84
when I was running training I got to see this over and over and over and over again as my

577
00:56:07.84 --> 00:56:14.56
fact we lay for chapter about it in the decademy leadership of situations where one situation

578
00:56:14.56 --> 00:56:20.24
particular where there's no voice no one's taking charge finally someone steps up and take

579
00:56:20.24 --> 00:56:26.88
charge and it's like boom everything changes but clear commanding voices are all too rare on the

580
00:56:26.88 --> 00:56:33.28
battle on the field of battle so they wait doing nothing and in action takes further toll on their

581
00:56:33.28 --> 00:56:40.64
resolve more grievous losses will no doubt come to this band of men in time but as a company this is

582
00:56:40.64 --> 00:56:45.36
the worst hour that they will ever know so it's a downward spiral if no one steps up and starts

583
00:56:45.36 --> 00:56:49.12
making calls you start taking casualties now if people panic even more they get more in their own

584
00:56:49.12 --> 00:56:54.000
little world they become more detached from each other less unity of what you're trying to make happen

585
00:56:56.56 --> 00:57:00.64
back to the book it would serve no purpose to dwell on the discouraging detail of this or

586
00:57:00.64 --> 00:57:06.16
deal if it were not for the belief that much of it is unnecessary and that the infantry soldier can

587
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:16.56
find a better way one must not come to rest on class vets gloomy warning that quote in war the novice

588
00:57:17.20 --> 00:57:27.60
is met only by pitch black knight on beyond that there are words to be read it is of the first

589
00:57:27.60 --> 00:57:34.16
importance that the soldier higher low should not have to encounter in war things which seem for the

590
00:57:34.16 --> 00:57:41.36
first time set him in terror or perplexity so that's calls for it's talking about training you

591
00:57:41.36 --> 00:57:45.68
got to get people ready for this chaos and mayhem you've got to get it get them ready for it you've

592
00:57:45.68 --> 00:57:50.80
got to get them ready you got to show them that when people panic and people are getting separated

593
00:57:50.80 --> 00:57:55.84
that one commanding voice one leader stepping up and leading will have a massive impact on the

594
00:57:55.84 --> 00:58:00.72
situation and failure to do that will also have a massive but the impact but it will be a massive negative

595
00:58:00.72 --> 00:58:12.72
impact now he talks chapter five is called ratio of fire and here we get into his little hypothesis

596
00:58:12.72 --> 00:58:16.40
I'm not going to waste a lot of time out of it but I'm going to bring it up back to the book now

597
00:58:16.40 --> 00:58:21.28
I do not think I've seen it stated in the military manuals of this age or in any of the writing

598
00:58:21.28 --> 00:58:26.16
's meant for the instruction of those who lead troops that a commander of infantry will be well

599
00:58:26.16 --> 00:58:31.20
advised to believe that when he engages the enemy not more than one quarter of his men will

600
00:58:31.20 --> 00:58:38.48
ever strike a real blow unless they are compelled by almost overpowering circumstances or unless

601
00:58:38.48 --> 00:58:44.96
all junior leaders constantly ride herd on troops with specific mission of increasing their fire

602
00:58:44.96 --> 00:58:55.04
the 25% estimate stands for even for well trained and campaign season troops I mean that 75%

603
00:58:55.04 --> 00:58:59.44
will not fire or will not persist in firing against the enemy and his works

604
00:59:00.32 --> 00:59:07.12
these men may face danger but will not fight so that's his hypothesis and actually the beginning

605
00:59:07.12 --> 00:59:12.08
of this book has a forward in it that I'm just going to touch on the forwards written by a guy named

606
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:23.76
Russell Glenn and he he points out some of the disputes against this about this low ratio of fire

607
00:59:23.76 --> 00:59:28.000
so here we go back to the book this is the introduction so this isn't SLA Marshall this is from the

608
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.56
introduction from Russell Glenn Marshall's ratio of fire values did not go unchallenged even when they

609
00:59:34.56 --> 00:59:42.000
first appeared in 1947 general James and Gavin World War II commander of the 82nd airborne division

610
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.52
discounted the low estimates as did Harry W.O. Kennard who served in the 101st airborne division

611
00:59:49.52 --> 00:59:54.56
in every one of its combat actions during World War II and later commanded the first cavalry

612
00:59:54.56 --> 01:00:01.76
division in Vietnam legendary general Bruce Clark commander of the US forces that defended St. Viff

613
01:00:01.76 --> 01:00:09.12
during the battle of the bulge flatly discounted Marshall finding his values ridiculous and dangerous

614
01:00:09.12 --> 01:00:18.48
assertions absolute nonsense another combat veteran british author George McDonald Fraser

615
01:00:18.48 --> 01:00:23.68
instead question Marshall's explanation for why soldiers failed to engage the enemy

616
01:00:24.72 --> 01:00:33.60
Fraser had served so one of the things that Marshall says is that people aren't are taught not to

617
01:00:33.60 --> 01:00:39.92
kill and you know it's against the commandments of God and it's bad to kill and so that's one of the

618
01:00:39.92 --> 01:00:47.76
things we have a moral and inherent moral objection to killing and so so this guy Donald Fraser

619
01:00:47.76 --> 01:00:53.36
Fraser had served in Burma as an infantryman though he recognized that moral upbringing might influence

620
01:00:53.36 --> 01:00:59.20
men's behavior his first-hand experience failed to support Marshall's rationale Fraser wrote that

621
01:00:59.20 --> 01:01:06.40
we all have kindly impulses fostered by 2,000 years of Christian teaching gentle Jesus and love

622
01:01:06.40 --> 01:01:12.48
thy neighbor but we have the killer instinct too the murderous impulse of the hunter

623
01:01:14.64 --> 01:01:21.28
and so the introduction of the book goes on and talks about many vets that just outright deny this

624
01:01:21.28 --> 01:01:32.000
and I do too and I never saw I never saw or felt any hesitation or saw anyone that I was with

625
01:01:33.60 --> 01:01:41.28
hesitate in any way to engage in fact quite the opposite most guys were more than ready to get after it

626
01:01:41.28 --> 01:01:45.36
and I'm not just talking about seals I'm talking about army infantrymen I'm talking about marines

627
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:54.16
the guys are guys are not hesitating I mean broadly you could never make a statement like this

628
01:01:54.16 --> 01:01:58.80
could you make a statement that some people hesitate yes you could make that statement but to

629
01:01:58.80 --> 01:02:05.28
broadly say that only 15 to 25% of people are going to actively engage the enemy from everything I saw

630
01:02:05.28 --> 01:02:13.20
that's patently untrue now the advantage and what we had for an advantage and

631
01:02:13.20 --> 01:02:20.000
martial kind of claims this too is that once World War II is over and they started training us

632
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.04
to shoot at one of the big objections it has that that guys were getting trained to shoot bulls

633
01:02:25.04 --> 01:02:29.20
eye targets right so that your training is shoot a bulls eye when you first see a man you're like oh no

634
01:02:29.20 --> 01:02:38.16
that's a man we my whole career I'd barely ever shot a bulls eye target we did that when we had to

635
01:02:38.16 --> 01:02:44.80
qualify with a rifle or pistol every single other time we shot we were shooting a man shaped target

636
01:02:44.80 --> 01:02:49.28
I mean we would shoot little round targets what were they called head plates right we're shooting at

637
01:02:49.28 --> 01:02:55.60
heads we're shooting body shots we're shooting that's what we do all the time and we shoot

638
01:02:55.60 --> 01:03:00.72
so we shoot targets with pictures on them with faces on them that look like people and then on top

639
01:03:00.72 --> 01:03:05.68
of that we did force on force training where we're actually shooting paint balls or semi-unition

640
01:03:05.68 --> 01:03:12.80
at other human beings and we're gunning them down so there's a lot of conditioning that we had that

641
01:03:12.80 --> 01:03:25.04
maybe that's why we were so much more apt and able and willing to shoot but yeah it's from you know

642
01:03:25.04 --> 01:03:30.000
you can see from what these other vets said and these other leaders said and my personal experience

643
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.24
and you'll find that I think SLA martial like I said I think you just had a hypothesis you

644
01:03:36.24 --> 01:03:42.72
wanted to talk about and threw it out there without really good facts behind it so I'm not going

645
01:03:42.72 --> 01:03:50.08
to waste a bunch of time talking about that and I'm going to go into the next chapter fire is the cure

646
01:03:54.16 --> 01:03:59.60
finally it is the volume of fire that counts you win if you kill more of the enemy than

647
01:03:59.60 --> 01:04:05.44
he can kill a view if you cannot you're defeated that's secretary of war robber p pattern and again

648
01:04:05.44 --> 01:04:10.000
I'll go back to this fire counts for sure it's important but you got him maneuver it's covered

649
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.72
move it's not just covering fire it's like you got to cover and move that's that's to me

650
01:04:15.44 --> 01:04:23.36
they go hand in hand which actually he says back the book fundamentally fire must always be beaten

651
01:04:23.36 --> 01:04:28.48
by fire fundamentally movement is the means of increasing the efficiency of ones own fire until

652
01:04:28.48 --> 01:04:34.64
the last strength of the enemy's fire is reduced to a vanish point okay I mean okay if you want to say

653
01:04:34.64 --> 01:04:39.04
that you're maneuvering so that you can maneuver so you can fire even better that's that's technically

654
01:04:39.04 --> 01:04:48.08
true or your maneuvering so you can break contact but you could say that here's another quote

655
01:04:48.08 --> 01:04:55.60
let us not think of mobility in an army general Charles P. Summer all once said unless we think

656
01:04:55.60 --> 01:05:02.64
of mobility accompanied by violence that's cover move that's fire maneuver that's what we're talking

657
01:05:02.64 --> 01:05:14.96
about combat can cannot ever approximate the conditions of field maneuvers fears of varying

658
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:20.88
sort of afflict the soldier in battle the unit commander soon comes to realize that one of his

659
01:05:20.88 --> 01:05:27.68
difficulties is to get men to leave cover because of enemy bullets and the fear they instill in training

660
01:05:28.32 --> 01:05:34.000
they're being no real bullet danger even on the courses which employ live ammunition every

661
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.04
advance under a supposed enemy fire is unrealistic two in training the soldier does not have a man

662
01:05:41.04 --> 01:05:46.80
as his target he is not shooting with the idea of killing there is a third vast difference in the

663
01:05:46.80 --> 01:05:52.48
two conditions the riflemen in training is usually under close observation and the chief pressure

664
01:05:52.48 --> 01:05:57.52
upon him is to give satisfaction to his superior whereas the riflemen engaging the enemy is

665
01:05:57.52 --> 01:06:03.84
of necessity pretty much on his own and the chief pressure on him is to remain alive if possible

666
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:10.56
when the infantry men mind when the infantry men's mind is gripped by fear his body is captured

667
01:06:10.56 --> 01:06:19.84
by inertia which is fears semi-situin in an attack half of the men on a firing line are in terror

668
01:06:19.84 --> 01:06:27.28
and the other half are unnerved so wrote major general jfc fuller when he was a young captain so

669
01:06:27.28 --> 01:06:31.44
again this is what i kind of already talked about the idea that in training you're shooting at

670
01:06:31.44 --> 01:06:35.12
you're not shooting with this intent to kill and we that's what we did all the time I mean

671
01:06:35.12 --> 01:06:39.36
that's just how we rolled if actually they make targets were like blood comes out we shoot and

672
01:06:39.36 --> 01:06:43.60
balloon blows up and black you see blood so they're trying to condition you and they talk about

673
01:06:43.60 --> 01:06:48.16
this with video games too right that these young kids come up killing all the time in these video

674
01:06:48.16 --> 01:06:54.40
games which are very very realistic and therefore they get conditioned to killing and they

675
01:06:54.40 --> 01:06:59.04
don't think it's a big deal anymore which clearly that you could tie that into

676
01:06:59.84 --> 01:07:03.52
school shootings a lot of people tie that into school shootings and say hey these kids were

677
01:07:03.52 --> 01:07:07.44
playing these video games where there's killing people all the time and that condition them

678
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:14.96
to be able to kill these innocent people in a school so there is like I said for me all I ever

679
01:07:14.96 --> 01:07:22.56
shot at basically was human targets things that look like people and again I've seen the video games

680
01:07:22.56 --> 01:07:28.24
that they are so realistic it's unbelievable and so that's another good form of conditioning

681
01:07:28.24 --> 01:07:35.68
to get you over the if you have any moral objection to killing now the the counter statement to that

682
01:07:35.68 --> 01:07:42.32
is good for people to get over the moral condition of killing some people no if you're not a soldier

683
01:07:42.32 --> 01:07:48.72
that's probably a bad thing I would say yeah yeah even the video game thing it seems like there's

684
01:07:48.72 --> 01:07:56.32
like a step before that to for someone to get conditioned to killing because I don't know obviously

685
01:07:56.32 --> 01:08:05.44
might in less intense video game experiences like PlayStation 2 which seems like a long time ago but

686
01:08:06.24 --> 01:08:11.52
so yeah the video games are realistic but it seems like that they they have to get past a certain

687
01:08:11.52 --> 01:08:17.60
step to consider the video games as being training so you guys like when you guys were you know

688
01:08:17.60 --> 01:08:22.08
and see training you know in the seal team you guys are specifically training for that specific thing

689
01:08:22.08 --> 01:08:27.52
that was on your mind so you're past the point of the moral objection part of it seems

690
01:08:27.52 --> 01:08:31.76
saying so let's say you weren't past the moral objection part of it and you were just

691
01:08:31.76 --> 01:08:34.72
shooting what if you'd be video games or shooting at the range or shooting at these other

692
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:38.64
things and you were like hey I know this is I'm not training for anything specifically I'm just

693
01:08:38.64 --> 01:08:43.44
sort of doing it whether it be for fun or to get better at shooting or better at this game or whatever

694
01:08:43.44 --> 01:08:50.72
if you're not past the moral objection part is it really training you to be less more morally

695
01:08:50.72 --> 01:08:55.60
well let's say if you're a kid that's like got some major issues and you're thinking about

696
01:08:55.60 --> 01:08:59.76
doing a school shooting and then you're sitting there playing these video games and you're

697
01:08:59.76 --> 01:09:04.64
killing people over and over again it's conditioning yeah yeah that's what I mean you put

698
01:09:04.64 --> 01:09:09.44
anyone in a you know you get someone that works in a slaughterhouse they don't think twice about

699
01:09:09.44 --> 01:09:13.92
killing a pig or killing a cow or whatever that's what they do they don't think a millisecond

700
01:09:13.92 --> 01:09:17.84
about it whereas you take someone that's never seen an animal killed before and it'll be

701
01:09:17.84 --> 01:09:23.92
disturbing to them so that right there is that they're conditioning is a thing right and if you

702
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:30.88
watch a bunch of you know a bunch of videos of something being killed you'd become conditioned to it

703
01:09:30.88 --> 01:09:35.04
and if you play a game where you kill people all the time you will become conditioned to it

704
01:09:35.04 --> 01:09:40.96
now I don't think this is even debatable yeah but I feel yeah I agree but I feel like there's this

705
01:09:40.96 --> 01:09:45.76
one kind of crucial step before that like you'd consider a slaughterhouse person like there's a

706
01:09:45.76 --> 01:09:49.20
difference between working in a slaughterhouse and being conditioned to the sight and the smell

707
01:09:49.20 --> 01:09:56.32
and the experience of doing it but not having the barrier that's like okay I'm gonna make a

708
01:09:56.32 --> 01:10:01.92
decision to do this under you know a different circumstance something that's more more

709
01:10:01.92 --> 01:10:06.64
morally tied well yeah I mean in let's face the factors millions and I'm others 100

710
01:10:06.64 --> 01:10:11.04
of millions of people that play video games all day long and they're not going out there and

711
01:10:11.04 --> 01:10:16.40
I have no intention of going out there but okay so yeah I see what you're saying if you start thinking

712
01:10:16.40 --> 01:10:21.76
that way and that becomes your intent then it is conditioning because you can even consider someone

713
01:10:21.76 --> 01:10:27.28
on the opposite where let's say they're morally what do you call them moral barrier has been

714
01:10:27.28 --> 01:10:30.80
crossed in their head or they're weird they're psychopath I don't know you know and they're brain

715
01:10:31.52 --> 01:10:37.84
and then they've never killed anyone or anything like that so I heard it actually read this thing

716
01:10:37.84 --> 01:10:44.56
on Saddam Hussein's son son's devil and so the first time how they'd quote him quote

717
01:10:44.56 --> 01:10:49.76
condition them they'd be like hey you know here's some prisoners shoot him kill him right so the

718
01:10:49.76 --> 01:10:55.28
first time now the first time not can these kids not conditioned in this way to you know to have

719
01:10:55.28 --> 01:10:59.60
the experience of killing somebody and watch them die and whatever so the first time they

720
01:10:59.60 --> 01:11:05.28
give them the gun they got you the kids shoots and what empties the clip right the kid was

721
01:11:05.28 --> 01:11:10.80
passed them that moral barrier long time ago but first time unconditioned as far as the experience

722
01:11:10.80 --> 01:11:17.04
goes he turns to the guard and goes hey can I have another magazine to do it so he really liked it

723
01:11:17.04 --> 01:11:21.44
he didn't need necessarily conditioning because he was passed that more apart so him saying yeah

724
01:11:21.44 --> 01:11:25.60
so yeah it feels like they are they are two separate things but once you kind of cross that

725
01:11:25.60 --> 01:11:30.000
that initial moral barrier oh yeah the more conditioned you are the you know the more

726
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.52
effect I mean I hate these were the effect but more into it you are or the less impact it'll have

727
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:42.72
like on your brain or whatever yeah and again we would get this is one of the things we get

728
01:11:42.72 --> 01:11:49.12
quoted on SLA Marshall was this stuff about how as the targets got more realistic it encouraged

729
01:11:49.12 --> 01:11:54.64
people and made them more comfortable with shooting and killing that's the point um

730
01:11:54.64 --> 01:12:03.68
then I believe yeah that's true it's true so it is going back to the book as another

731
01:12:03.68 --> 01:12:09.84
experiment unwilling riflemen may have maybe switched to heavier and more decisive one man

732
01:12:09.84 --> 01:12:16.000
weapons this sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to come from increased

733
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.28
responsibility this is good so he said you got a rifleman that doesn't want to shoot give him a

734
01:12:21.28 --> 01:12:30.16
bigger more effective weapon he says this sounds like a paradox to expect greater response to

735
01:12:30.16 --> 01:12:36.88
come from increased responsibility but it works I've seen many cases were men who had

736
01:12:36.88 --> 01:12:42.80
funked it badly with a rifle responded heroically when given a flame thrower or a bar

737
01:12:43.84 --> 01:12:49.44
self-pried and the ego are the touchstone of most these remarkable conversions a man may fail

738
01:12:49.44 --> 01:12:54.08
with the rifle because he feels anonymous and believes it nothing important is being asked of him

739
01:12:55.04 --> 01:12:58.16
so that's pretty cool because I talk about this all the time why could the earth because everyone

740
01:12:58.16 --> 01:13:02.88
has a rifle and he's like okay let's not really but I'm not really that important yeah

741
01:13:02.88 --> 01:13:07.28
then you give him like a heavy weapon or heavy machine gun or a flame thrower and also he's like

742
01:13:07.28 --> 01:13:11.52
oh yeah I'm the man I'm going to step up and make this happen which if I've talked about this many

743
01:13:11.52 --> 01:13:16.32
times on the podcast you get someone that's not doing their job or they need to do a better job

744
01:13:16.32 --> 01:13:21.84
or what have you if you can give them more responsibility they have a good chance of actually

745
01:13:21.84 --> 01:13:26.80
stepping up and making things happen root off the red nose reindeer not familiar with the

746
01:13:26.80 --> 01:13:31.60
what yeah don't have familiar with root off the red nose yeah okay so root off was the only one

747
01:13:31.60 --> 01:13:36.32
with the red nose and before they were like they used to tease him and all this stuff you know

748
01:13:36.32 --> 01:13:42.000
so he's he thought he was inferior but when Santa was like hey your nose is so bright

749
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.44
won't you guide my slate or tonight I get to guide the slay hell yeah steps up does the job there you

750
01:13:47.44 --> 01:13:54.16
don't see check yeah see you get it that out if you want to no reds the same thing conceptually

751
01:13:54.16 --> 01:14:03.04
conceptually all right next back to the book and last if we are to strengthen sound training principles

752
01:14:03.04 --> 01:14:07.92
and establish mental attitudes which are essential to the understanding of the decisive

753
01:14:07.92 --> 01:14:15.44
importance of fire in tactics we will be well advised to cease talking about fire and movement

754
01:14:15.44 --> 01:14:23.76
as if the latter were separate and apart from the former in tactical fact there and there did

755
01:14:23.76 --> 01:14:29.04
not exist an automatic and unbreakable connection between them so now he's saying the same thing

756
01:14:29.04 --> 01:14:34.72
that I was saying earlier is fire is not more important they're the same thing fire maneuver

757
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:41.44
cover move half to happen together that's what he's saying fire is the key to mobility

758
01:14:41.44 --> 01:14:48.64
to fire is to move so he goes on now this next section again this is great because

759
01:14:49.84 --> 01:14:55.60
next section is called the multiples of information the multiples of information and what's great

760
01:14:55.60 --> 01:15:00.64
about this is he's no longer talking about he's no longer talking about tactics of fire maneuver

761
01:15:00.64 --> 01:15:05.04
and this percentage of fire and all that because he's out of his element there to be quite honest

762
01:15:05.04 --> 01:15:10.80
with you this one he's going to get into his element which is well I'll go to it

763
01:15:13.20 --> 01:15:18.88
I consider to be of utmost importance the keeping informed of our man as to current situation

764
01:15:18.88 --> 01:15:24.16
so that each man may perform his duty with understanding of its importance and that's sergeant

765
01:15:24.16 --> 01:15:30.96
David T. Bolt in a letter written from the African theater so you gotta keep your people informed

766
01:15:33.28 --> 01:15:39.04
having started to call this chapter communications I decided against it for fear

767
01:15:39.84 --> 01:15:44.80
that use of that rather formidable word might interfere with my communicating to the reader

768
01:15:44.80 --> 01:15:51.28
what I regard as a vital but frequently overlooked principle of minor tactics if a word

769
01:15:51.28 --> 01:15:56.64
comes to mean too many things it frequently misses fire at the critical point that has been the

770
01:15:56.64 --> 01:16:03.60
fate of the word communications it has become another military catch all and because it means so many

771
01:16:03.60 --> 01:16:11.20
things it is quite frequently means nothing to illustrate a regimental commander asks a company

772
01:16:11.20 --> 01:16:16.64
commander how are your communications and the latter replies excellent because his telephone line

773
01:16:16.64 --> 01:16:23.12
is working and his supply is coming forward and at the same time he is at the point of despair

774
01:16:23.12 --> 01:16:29.12
because he hasn't had anything worthwhile any worthwhile intelligence from his flanks for hours

775
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.32
so there's a difference between communication like I can talk to you and actual communication

776
01:16:34.32 --> 01:16:40.40
you're telling you what I need to know one would think that it would become almost second

777
01:16:40.40 --> 01:16:46.16
nature to the commander to reach eagerly toward supporting forces one would imagine that whenever

778
01:16:46.16 --> 01:16:50.80
on the field of battle he made contact with a friendly element that fact would flash a red light

779
01:16:50.80 --> 01:16:56.000
in his brain causing him automatically to raise the question have I established full communications

780
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.72
do I know the strength and intentions of the force now helping me do they know my strength and

781
01:17:00.72 --> 01:17:07.36
intentions but indeed such is not the case communications

782
01:17:07.36 --> 01:17:17.52
information is the soul of morale and combat and the balancing force in successful tactics

783
01:17:19.36 --> 01:17:23.52
and now he talks a little bit about communication he gives some guidelines about him

784
01:17:24.40 --> 01:17:28.96
and what the problems are so information is super important here's some of the problems one

785
01:17:28.96 --> 01:17:36.000
there is a lacking there is lacking a general recognition of the supreme importance of the lateral

786
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.12
flow of information two command at the lower levels is too often neglectful of the principle

787
01:17:43.12 --> 01:17:50.16
that it is not a channel of information only but a distribution point so you got to pass the word

788
01:17:50.88 --> 01:17:56.72
three commanders at the lower levels tend to be arbitrary judges of what information deriving from a

789
01:17:56.72 --> 01:18:01.92
source lower would be highly useful to the other elements lowered down instead of a biting

790
01:18:01.92 --> 01:18:09.36
by the rule went and out pass it along so went and out pass along now I do have to throw out

791
01:18:10.88 --> 01:18:14.96
that there can be a dichotter there's a dichotter because you can communicate things too much

792
01:18:14.96 --> 01:18:19.36
you can send too many emails you can send too many messages you can do that that can be a problem

793
01:18:20.80 --> 01:18:24.000
and he actually talks about that dichotter me a little bit so he's just talked about how much

794
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.48
you should communicate and then he gets to this point back to the book in the Pacific flighting

795
01:18:28.48 --> 01:18:33.28
I found company commanders joining a platoon in the line just to isolate themselves from their

796
01:18:33.28 --> 01:18:39.84
telephones they were literally tired to death of having the battalion commander insist on having a

797
01:18:39.84 --> 01:18:45.76
fresh progress report every 15 or 20 minutes and the battalion commander poor devil was only

798
01:18:45.76 --> 01:18:50.88
passing on the pressure which he had in turn received from a regimental commander who is trying to

799
01:18:50.88 --> 01:18:58.08
playkate division yet one would observe that unless a battalion commander is wholly lacking in judgment

800
01:18:58.08 --> 01:19:04.96
or intestinal fortitude he should be strong enough to take this on his aching back and not pass it

801
01:19:04.96 --> 01:19:11.36
down to the headquarters which is at grips with the enemy this happens all the time in the military

802
01:19:11.36 --> 01:19:16.56
for sure the senior commanders going I want to know what's going on and tell us that to the next

803
01:19:16.56 --> 01:19:21.60
junior guys is alright I'm all find out what's going on and that guy says I'll find out what's going on

804
01:19:21.60 --> 01:19:25.36
and the people in the front line they can't even fight because they're too busy trying to answer

805
01:19:25.36 --> 01:19:31.44
the damn questions from up the chain of command so don't let that happen back to the book in the

806
01:19:31.44 --> 01:19:37.68
burden island fight during the invasion of the marshals one of these prodding demands for more

807
01:19:37.68 --> 01:19:42.32
progress raised from division right through lower headquarters to a platoon which had been stopped

808
01:19:42.32 --> 01:19:49.44
cold by japfire coming from spider holes arranged in great depth along the beach the lieutenant

809
01:19:49.44 --> 01:19:54.88
got the message and crawling forward to the his most advanced riflemen told him to get up and go on

810
01:19:56.24 --> 01:20:02.000
the boy screamed so the whole goddamn army wants me to want to kill me does it okay lieutenant

811
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.20
here I go but watch what happens he was shot dead almost before he had gotten out of his tracks

812
01:20:09.20 --> 01:20:16.32
that incident seared deep into the brain of every man who witnessed it it was final judgment on

813
01:20:16.32 --> 01:20:23.92
the futility of that kind of leading decentralized command who's going to make a better call somebody

814
01:20:23.92 --> 01:20:32.40
back in the rear or this lieutenant that's there on the beach back to the book the all two frequent

815
01:20:32.40 --> 01:20:38.64
consequences of such pressure are lying exaggeration and distortion of the situation at lower

816
01:20:38.64 --> 01:20:44.16
levels resulting in a false concept of the situation at the higher the average company commander can

817
01:20:44.16 --> 01:20:49.28
stand only a limited amount of this heat and then he will knock over a couple of outhouses

818
01:20:49.28 --> 01:20:58.16
and report that he has captured a village. It also this effect also makes a wishful thinker of the

819
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:04.08
most objective shoulder he reads he reads into himself I'll have that position in another hour

820
01:21:04.08 --> 01:21:15.44
so I'll tell him that I have it now and get them off my back so lots about communication being

821
01:21:15.44 --> 01:21:22.32
important next is the riddle of command many headquarters people become strangers to the front

822
01:21:22.32 --> 01:21:27.76
and cannot speak its language or understand its tribulations okay the you don't know what's going

823
01:21:27.76 --> 01:21:30.88
on the front lines if you don't have any idea if you can't even speak their language anymore you

824
01:21:30.88 --> 01:21:34.88
need to get down there you need to find out what's going on on the front lines businesses that

825
01:21:34.88 --> 01:21:43.52
means you too the diabolical effect of even such a relatively simple instrument as the field

826
01:21:43.52 --> 01:21:52.40
telephone is that it may come to command the commander the phone actually gets control of you it

827
01:21:52.40 --> 01:21:57.52
chains into a system of remote control at first he sees it only as a successful as a useful

828
01:21:57.52 --> 01:22:02.64
channel for quick communication and combat then he fears to leave it less it should require his

829
01:22:02.64 --> 01:22:10.16
presence in headquarters the moment after he leaves to go forward this state of mind in turn creates

830
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:16.72
its own illusion fostering that fostering the conclusion that under the new system of war all

831
01:22:16.72 --> 01:22:22.08
matters can be settled at a distance all problems arising within the zone of fire can be fully

832
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:27.44
understood without ever going there and all moral values which once attended the commander

833
01:22:27.44 --> 01:22:34.32
effort to impress his men with his personality and character are somehow sundered by the new technology

834
01:22:34.32 --> 01:22:43.04
of operations out of sedentary general ship arises evil of troops which while obeying mechanically

835
01:22:43.04 --> 01:22:49.52
have no organic thinking response to the commander's will so i mean how how poignant is this

836
01:22:49.52 --> 01:22:54.000
first what we live in today right everyone thinks they can just send a text message in the problem

837
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.28
solved make a quick phone call on the problem solved and actually the reality is sometimes you

838
01:22:59.28 --> 01:23:04.72
need to get down there you also the whole thing about it controlling you you know i mean

839
01:23:04.72 --> 01:23:10.80
do you ever forget your do you have that at all like when you leave your phone at home or in

840
01:23:10.80 --> 01:23:14.64
the car something like that where you don't have it for like yeah you know i don't forget things

841
01:23:14.64 --> 01:23:20.72
a lot so i don't that doesn't really happen me a lot but yeah i would say if if i left my phone

842
01:23:20.72 --> 01:23:25.12
somewhere i would be like oh dang i want to try and call me right now one if there's an emergency

843
01:23:25.12 --> 01:23:29.52
going on yeah what's weird but you know back in the day when we're you know whatever

844
01:23:30.64 --> 01:23:40.88
teenagers or whatever pre cell phones pre cell phone yeah there was no internet i was telling

845
01:23:40.88 --> 01:23:46.32
my kids the other day that when i was a kid there was no internet that was not a thing yeah that's

846
01:23:46.32 --> 01:23:51.20
like saying there's no roads yeah for that that this is the same thing yeah for my kids they're like

847
01:23:51.20 --> 01:23:56.96
what they were looking me like what what did you believe i didn't you know just because you

848
01:23:56.96 --> 01:24:03.36
you had to go to the library no to look something up get an encyclopedia i remember thinking

849
01:24:03.36 --> 01:24:09.44
in cyclopedias were were like holy yeah i don't know mean there were so in dictionaries i

850
01:24:09.44 --> 01:24:18.08
thought that was like a like a holy book i filled my mom at a ad a ad an oe de oxford english dictionary

851
01:24:18.08 --> 01:24:22.24
not the the four one is a volume the four one is twenty six volumes or something crazy like

852
01:24:23.04 --> 01:24:30.40
but my mom had one that was big i mean it was big it was six inches thick yeah it was like six

853
01:24:30.40 --> 01:24:36.40
maybe six inches thick and big and it had little tabs little indentations bigger yeah you think

854
01:24:36.40 --> 01:24:43.52
about it but to me that thing seemed like some kind of bible yeah some kind of just seems

855
01:24:43.52 --> 01:24:48.56
so filled with knowledge and if you didn't know what a word was you just had to go look it up

856
01:24:48.56 --> 01:24:52.32
and that thing you didn't know what a thing was you look it up in the encyclopedias you go

857
01:24:52.32 --> 01:24:57.04
library and look it up in the encyclopedias nowadays you're three seconds away you got that

858
01:24:57.04 --> 01:25:02.64
google yeah you want to look in the dictionary dot com dictionary dot com bo need those fingers

859
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:07.12
unless you got that really the app oh you the app won't even better because you got to

860
01:25:07.12 --> 01:25:11.12
want to get that etymology of the word to you on the word it comes on that stuff yeah

861
01:25:11.12 --> 01:25:17.28
then you got what what's the the street language what is that one uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

862
01:25:17.28 --> 01:25:22.08
urban dictionary yeah that's kind of fun balance alert but here's the thing it's weird it's like

863
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:26.64
it is fun and it's funny but it's very useful because you know when people they'll say stuff

864
01:25:26.64 --> 01:25:30.64
and you're like wait wait I had to look some things up on urban dictionary a couple times i'm trying

865
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:36.000
to think of a good example right now but i can't think of one next time i will i will note

866
01:25:36.80 --> 01:25:41.68
that it cuz you know i got teenage kids so sometimes they got some words yeah you got to know

867
01:25:41.68 --> 01:25:46.64
that's like we're saying something a couple years ago hi fee remember i don't remember that

868
01:25:46.64 --> 01:25:52.88
oh well that's not all that's new hi fee what does it mean well i don't know if i can define

869
01:25:52.88 --> 01:26:00.24
it specifically but it means like get fired up like it's like dope oh okay hi fee okay

870
01:26:00.24 --> 01:26:05.68
oh fifty cent or somebody i don't know anyway but yeah but that's the thing though you you

871
01:26:05.68 --> 01:26:11.60
lose or you forget yourself on you go to the store i don't know you go to the vans and you leave

872
01:26:11.60 --> 01:26:16.24
by accident or whatever your phone at home it's like oh yeah and just like how you said

873
01:26:16.24 --> 01:26:19.36
you got those thoughts like oh what if there's an emergency what if someone's calling me kind of

874
01:26:19.36 --> 01:26:24.88
thing yeah all you got to do is black press it calls yeah yeah or this is the one day that there's

875
01:26:24.88 --> 01:26:28.96
like any emergency i'm not to say that you can't have an emergency you totally can't but it's like

876
01:26:28.96 --> 01:26:37.28
of literally the 99.99 99 99 9% of the time you have access to that phone that one teeny tiny

877
01:26:37.28 --> 01:26:41.68
sliver of time that you don't oh now all the emergency is gonna come soon say and you think back

878
01:26:41.68 --> 01:26:46.80
to when you when there was no cell phones it's like how did you ever get along no i'm doing that right

879
01:26:46.80 --> 01:26:54.000
now i'm going with my cell phone but everyone around here's a thing though with that everyone around

880
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.72
you kind of feel the same thing so like for example if you go to the store or if i go to the

881
01:26:58.72 --> 01:27:04.000
store people know i go to the store or people know i went to store my wife knows you know

882
01:27:04.64 --> 01:27:09.44
maybe if i'm like hanging out with friends or i'm gonna store real quick right we're having a barbecue

883
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:15.60
I don't know they expecting me to have my phone and i expect to have a phone so it's like that

884
01:27:15.60 --> 01:27:20.64
communication now communication the standard of communication is way higher now yeah so you say like

885
01:27:20.64 --> 01:27:27.60
you're access to someone else is okay one thing that is a kind of a bummer and i you know for a long

886
01:27:27.60 --> 01:27:34.80
time i responded to like everybody that reached out to me and and i just can't i mean i can't do it

887
01:27:34.80 --> 01:27:39.84
i just i would be doing nothing but sitting around doing that yeah and it's really cool man i

888
01:27:39.84 --> 01:27:50.32
get letters and emails and facebook and dms on you know and i just don't have time and i feel bad

889
01:27:50.32 --> 01:27:57.12
you know i read most everything but it's been getting crazy and here's the thing and i think

890
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:04.24
this is important to understand overall for kind of you for sure for everyone when someone you know

891
01:28:04.24 --> 01:28:09.44
how like someone will text you or someone will send you like a message like a long message and some

892
01:28:10.24 --> 01:28:15.04
it's easy to think like hey you could have responded with like just something you know rather

893
01:28:15.04 --> 01:28:19.68
than nothing but here's the thing it that's not true because someone sends you a text message or

894
01:28:19.68 --> 01:28:25.44
especially something long and meaningful like you don't want to just reply back with okay or okay

895
01:28:25.44 --> 01:28:30.24
a text you later more about this message that that makes way less sense you want to have something

896
01:28:30.24 --> 01:28:35.92
kind of thought out yeah so it's not just a small little response or you who doesn't have time

897
01:28:35.92 --> 01:28:41.36
to send one text well the thing is yeah physically sending the text doesn't take any time

898
01:28:41.36 --> 01:28:48.000
but to consider you're a valid or appropriate response to most text and in a special in your case

899
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.68
where you get messages legit messages you can just be like cool yeah and then move on to the next

900
01:28:53.68 --> 01:28:58.32
thing you can't do that so you gotta like consider all these things and then all that consideration

901
01:28:58.32 --> 01:29:03.28
that's what takes the time yeah and mental energy by the way like like for like you can't go

902
01:29:03.28 --> 01:29:08.56
in one direction mentally and just pivot real quick and be like yeah let me just mentally accommodate

903
01:29:08.56 --> 01:29:12.64
this you know it's like man it takes more thought than that so it's hard to fit it all in

904
01:29:12.64 --> 01:29:19.76
especially for you know it is man i feel bad when i can't get back to people but i appreciate them

905
01:29:19.76 --> 01:29:28.48
reaching out and letting me know that they're getting good information right whether it's work

906
01:29:28.48 --> 01:29:33.20
related whether it's individual person related their kids whatever warrior i mean all kinds of

907
01:29:33.20 --> 01:29:40.80
good stuff and i'm so stoked but like you said it's like like i can't literally just cannot

908
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:49.12
see that's tried yeah yeah yeah and i tried so i posted uh today i was like hey it's Monday

909
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.04
sometimes life gets up or hand you gotta go you gotta attack yeah and that's why i was feeling

910
01:29:55.04 --> 01:29:58.88
this weekend i was like because i've been on the road we went to Maine didn't get a lot of work

911
01:29:58.88 --> 01:30:04.08
done to Maine because we were working in Maine we were rolling and then we were working in recording

912
01:30:04.08 --> 01:30:08.72
podcasts and interviewing and all that stuff so didn't have a lot of time out there got a little

913
01:30:08.72 --> 01:30:16.000
bit behind life got the upper hand on me and so i was kind of feeling it on when i got home and

914
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.12
then when i said it was oh you know what i'm gonna do so Sunday i just i'm just gonna work all day

915
01:30:21.12 --> 01:30:26.32
just get just get busy get the upper hand because people were talking about the kids podcast

916
01:30:28.08 --> 01:30:33.28
hip podcast yeah where's the other you know hey hey my kids love listening to it

917
01:30:33.28 --> 01:30:37.44
when listening to it for the we're listening to the first 16 episodes for the ninth time now

918
01:30:37.44 --> 01:30:44.08
can you make another one or are you giving up on that like oh those are straight up five times

919
01:30:44.08 --> 01:30:49.60
yeah so so i got after that recorded some of that today but well that's what i did go on

920
01:30:49.60 --> 01:30:55.12
the attack like and that really does it really like by the end by by the end of Sunday i was like

921
01:30:55.12 --> 01:30:58.96
oh i got and i thought i thought it's gonna be a late night on Sunday i thought midnight

922
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:03.04
which you know i don't want to go to bed a midnight on the Sunday night i got to god

923
01:31:03.04 --> 01:31:10.64
done it's like 945 at night i was like oh yeah and i was ahead i was back ahead but i had to get

924
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:15.84
aggressive i had to dig deep i had to go like okay this is what's going on so if you start feeling

925
01:31:15.84 --> 01:31:21.84
that little life's getting the upper hand if you if you let it continue to maneuver on you

926
01:31:21.84 --> 01:31:26.16
it's gonna get worse if you go oh oh you think you're gonna get the upper hand i mean watch this

927
01:31:26.16 --> 01:31:30.72
i'm gonna get aggressive i'm gonna knock out so much stuff in the next 24 hours you're not

928
01:31:30.72 --> 01:31:35.76
gonna know what just happened son yeah so that's how i went at you know as is actually i

929
01:31:35.76 --> 01:31:39.92
made the video on monday technically it was a Sunday evolution but by the time monday

930
01:31:39.92 --> 01:31:44.64
little around i was back in the game yeah that's too hard it's good like if you get the or

931
01:31:44.64 --> 01:31:49.52
it's something someone else something else gets to the upper hand it's like dang you got to

932
01:31:49.52 --> 01:31:53.92
work double time just so it doesn't have the upper hand any more once you get the upper hand okay

933
01:31:53.92 --> 01:31:58.000
yeah you can boom you can find your way the way when when you get the upper hand

934
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.52
it's like when you're playing a sport and the team starts to get the little upper hand and then

935
01:32:03.52 --> 01:32:07.60
they just they can start taking a little bit more risks they get a little bit more confident yeah

936
01:32:07.60 --> 01:32:12.56
and they get them will match yeah they get them momentum and they start going and that's productive

937
01:32:12.56 --> 01:32:19.12
right that they they widen that score run up the score boy and so that's the same thing i'm thinking

938
01:32:19.12 --> 01:32:24.72
but i had me on the ropes a little bit you know it was on the ropes i was on the ropes over here and

939
01:32:24.72 --> 01:32:30.56
i had to think i had to get it i woke up early and i was just boom i'm gonna start hammering

940
01:32:30.56 --> 01:32:35.76
and that's what you got to do finished reading a book wrote another book edited a book i had to

941
01:32:35.76 --> 01:32:45.68
postak a stuff come get some be aggressive okay so the communication things here's the other

942
01:32:45.68 --> 01:32:53.28
thing that happens with modern communications text messaging emails you start losing that little

943
01:32:53.28 --> 01:32:57.28
personal touch which is important here we go back to the book with his characteristically warm

944
01:32:57.28 --> 01:33:02.96
humor general Eisenhower has commented on the value of the personal factor in the command

945
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:08.80
relation to his men under the conditions of modern war i found that it did a great deal of good

946
01:33:08.80 --> 01:33:16.16
to get down to my troops in the combat area my presence relax them and made them feel more comfortable

947
01:33:16.16 --> 01:33:21.60
about the situation but i was not deceived as to the reason i knew what was running through

948
01:33:21.60 --> 01:33:27.28
their minds they were saying to themselves there must be less danger than we thought or the old man

949
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:35.92
wouldn't be here yeah get down talk the troops here we talk about this is a part of the nature

950
01:33:35.92 --> 01:33:42.08
of the combat soldier once he loses that faith it becomes very difficult to resolve it he will

951
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:48.000
lose it very quickly when he sees that casualties are wasted on useless operations or when he

952
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.96
begins to feel that he is in any respect the victim of bad planning or faulty concepts that's

953
01:33:56.96 --> 01:34:07.12
important then he responds to that principle which was once well stated by general james harbored

954
01:34:07.12 --> 01:34:15.60
discipline and moral influence the inarticulate vote that is constantly taken by masses of men when

955
01:34:15.60 --> 01:34:21.92
the order comes to move forward when the order comes to move forward a variant of the crowd

956
01:34:21.92 --> 01:34:28.16
psychology that inclines it to follow a leader but the army does not move forward until the motion is

957
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:35.12
carried unanimous consent only follows cooperation between the invid individual men in ranks

958
01:34:36.24 --> 01:34:40.64
that's a bold statement like hey you can give that order but until everybody kind of knows that

959
01:34:40.64 --> 01:34:52.56
it's a good plan we're not knowing here's another good statement by rough approximation 60% of the

960
01:34:52.56 --> 01:34:58.48
art of command is the ability to anticipate 40% of the art of command is the ability to improvise

961
01:34:59.68 --> 01:35:04.88
to reject the preconceived idea that has been tested and proved wrong in the crucible of

962
01:35:04.88 --> 01:35:14.24
operations and to rule by action instead of acting by rules that's a good one by the way that's the

963
01:35:14.24 --> 01:35:22.56
entire art of command that's 100% anticipation and ability to improvise obviously there's some more

964
01:35:22.56 --> 01:35:28.24
factors those are some important ones and I don't think I pulled it out but there's also one

965
01:35:28.24 --> 01:35:34.72
part in the book where it says anticipation is important but it's but it's you can't just say someone hey

966
01:35:34.72 --> 01:35:41.76
anticipate harder and anticipate more it's hard to say to that someone someone's got to have experience

967
01:35:41.76 --> 01:35:45.52
someone's got to have the mindset for it they got to they got to free their mind it open their

968
01:35:45.52 --> 01:35:51.68
minds so that they can be aware of little nuances that are happening and changes that are occurring

969
01:35:51.68 --> 01:35:55.04
and you can't be down in the weeds or else you can't anticipate anything because you're getting

970
01:35:55.04 --> 01:36:01.20
knocked around in the dust and the dirt yeah so it's kind of like a pay attention kind of thing like

971
01:36:01.20 --> 01:36:08.24
it's a it's a way of paying attention I think really the key is detachment because if you can't

972
01:36:08.24 --> 01:36:11.76
detach you're not going to be able to anticipate anything because you're in and that's why there's

973
01:36:11.76 --> 01:36:15.76
obviously dichotomy here yeah do you want to go down and be with the troops absolutely but can you

974
01:36:15.76 --> 01:36:19.28
go down and be with troops so much that you lose track of what's happening at a strategic level

975
01:36:19.28 --> 01:36:23.12
and you can't anticipate what's happening no you can't do that dichotomy leadership you got

976
01:36:23.12 --> 01:36:30.16
to balance it back to the book during war it often time happens that one company by trial and

977
01:36:30.16 --> 01:36:36.08
error finds the true solution for some acute problem which concerns everyone but when that happens

978
01:36:36.08 --> 01:36:40.72
to a company I can assure you that is the exceptional company officer who takes the initiative and

979
01:36:40.72 --> 01:36:45.76
passes it passes his unique solution along to his superiors even after he has proved and

980
01:36:45.76 --> 01:36:51.60
battle that the idea works a good company idea in tactics is likely to remain confined to one company

981
01:36:51.60 --> 01:36:56.88
indefinitely even though it would be a benefit to the whole military establishment this is

982
01:36:56.88 --> 01:37:00.80
where this is just dealing with silos it happens in the military it happens in the civilian sector

983
01:37:00.80 --> 01:37:07.44
somebody figures something out make keep to themselves the fundamental purpose of all training today

984
01:37:07.44 --> 01:37:15.28
should be to develop the natural faculties and to stimulate the brain of the soldier rather than

985
01:37:15.28 --> 01:37:23.04
to treat him as a cog which has been fitted into a great machine got to keep point that out

986
01:37:26.80 --> 01:37:33.68
loyalty in the masses of men wax is strong in the degree that they are made to believe that

987
01:37:33.68 --> 01:37:39.28
real importance is attached to their work and to their ability to think about their work

988
01:37:39.28 --> 01:37:47.60
so you got to get people engaged and people got to understand and believe that what they're

989
01:37:47.60 --> 01:37:51.84
doing is important and they got to have some kind of say they got to have some control over their own fate

990
01:37:53.20 --> 01:37:58.64
it weakens at every point where they consider that there is a negative respect for their intelligence

991
01:37:59.60 --> 01:38:05.12
this rule applies whether a man is engaged in digging a ditch or in working up a loading table

992
01:38:05.12 --> 01:38:12.40
for an invasion so if you have negative respect for people's intelligence they're not going to do a good job

993
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.52
big chunk a little bit of a big chunk here to square training with a reality of war it becomes a necessary

994
01:38:21.52 --> 01:38:26.32
part of the young officer's mental equipment for training to instill in him the full realization

995
01:38:26.32 --> 01:38:32.64
that in combat many things can and will go wrong without it being anyone's fault in particular

996
01:38:32.64 --> 01:38:39.28
so what did I just say things are going to happen is no one's fault does that really

997
01:38:39.92 --> 01:38:44.32
does that really marry up with the idea of extreme ownership well not really great because I'm

998
01:38:44.32 --> 01:38:52.16
taking ownership of anything however keep listening war is aimed at destruction the fire and general

999
01:38:52.16 --> 01:38:58.000
purpose of the enemy are directed against one's own personnel material and communications with the

1000
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.04
objective keeping one's own design from coming into play small plans miscarried because the wrong

1001
01:39:05.04 --> 01:39:10.48
man happens to be hit at the critical moment or the guns which were counted on are knocked out of action

1002
01:39:11.28 --> 01:39:18.88
the problem of command in battle is ever to establish a safe margin which will allow for such

1003
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:25.12
misadventure there you go so things are going to go wrong but what you have to take ownership of is

1004
01:39:25.12 --> 01:39:32.40
figuring out how you're going to have a plan that's going to overcome those problems back to the

1005
01:39:32.40 --> 01:39:37.20
book but this much is certain there is no system of safeguards known to man which can fully

1006
01:39:37.20 --> 01:39:43.76
eliminate the consequences of accident and mischance in battle hence the only final protection

1007
01:39:43.76 --> 01:39:50.48
is the resiliency and courage of the commander and his subordinates so what does that mean when something

1008
01:39:50.48 --> 01:39:56.56
goes wrong when something bad happens you adapt you adjust you you alter your plans and you continue

1009
01:39:56.56 --> 01:40:04.64
forward you own it it therefore follows that the far object of a training system is to prepare the

1010
01:40:04.64 --> 01:40:11.04
combat officer mentally so that he can cope with the unusual and the unexpected as if it were the

1011
01:40:11.04 --> 01:40:19.92
altogether normal and give him poise in a situation where all else is in disequilibrium

1012
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:26.96
say all over and over again and how do you do that how do you do that in the civilian sector right

1013
01:40:26.96 --> 01:40:31.84
prepare your people you role-play with people you give them hard problems you make them figure things out

1014
01:40:32.80 --> 01:40:40.16
you put them in tough situations so that they become accustomed to it but how to do it I would say

1015
01:40:40.16 --> 01:40:45.84
that the beginning lies in a system of schooling which puts the emphasis on teaching soldiers how to

1016
01:40:45.84 --> 01:40:51.76
think rather than what to think even though such a revolutionary idea would put the army somewhat ahead

1017
01:40:51.76 --> 01:40:58.40
of our civilian education that's a common thing that gets said in military training is teaching

1018
01:40:58.40 --> 01:41:06.72
people how to think not what to think and this is a good the test of fitness of command is the

1019
01:41:06.72 --> 01:41:13.04
ability to think clearly in the face of unexpected contingency or opportunity improvisation is the

1020
01:41:13.04 --> 01:41:19.68
essence of initiative in all combat just as initiative is the outward showing of the power of decision

1021
01:41:22.08 --> 01:41:26.16
think about this when you're raising your kids too that's a good little something to think about

1022
01:41:26.16 --> 01:41:33.44
you want your kids to be able to think think get that's what we got to have doing some creative

1023
01:41:33.44 --> 01:41:44.000
stuff right sure jiu jitsu's creative but you got to throw some other stuff out back to the book the

1024
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.84
darkest hour for the novice in war comes with the recoil after the unit has been had badly hit

1025
01:41:51.12 --> 01:41:55.76
it is then that the young commander has greatest need of the friendship and steadiness of his

1026
01:41:55.76 --> 01:42:02.32
superior or of any other officer whose judgment he respects criticism or tactical counsel are of

1027
01:42:02.32 --> 01:42:09.44
no value at this time they can be given that later of necessary but in the wrong hour they add to the

1028
01:42:09.44 --> 01:42:18.64
hurt led him get out his crying towel when he has told how it happened the important thing is that he

1029
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:23.76
be given a pat on the back and insurance and assurance that he did his full duty and some little

1030
01:42:23.76 --> 01:42:29.60
reminder that while he may feel that his losses are excessive such incidents are unavoidable

1031
01:42:29.60 --> 01:42:36.08
feature of combat and do not keep one from coming back in the next round in secret in sick

1032
01:42:36.08 --> 01:42:42.24
freed sassons memories of an infantry man the young lieutenant tells of emerging from a bloody

1033
01:42:42.24 --> 01:42:50.000
trench raid and meeting his kernel this was kind kernel kynjak i'd never met before and it was the

1034
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.16
first time i had ever shared any human equality with him he spoke kindly to me in his rough way

1035
01:42:56.16 --> 01:43:04.32
and in doing so he made me very thankful that i had done what i could so i mean this is a very

1036
01:43:04.32 --> 01:43:09.60
important especially for folks that are in the military or in services where you can take losses

1037
01:43:10.64 --> 01:43:16.96
and that is when you're in charge it's the time is not then to provide tactical counsel

1038
01:43:17.52 --> 01:43:23.44
right that's not the time first you got to let the person get over the emotional hump help them through

1039
01:43:23.44 --> 01:43:30.16
that and if you got to go back and debrief later that's what you do i think everybody needs to pay

1040
01:43:30.16 --> 01:43:34.80
attention to that and i mean you could say the same thing for businesses you know if somebody

1041
01:43:34.80 --> 01:43:38.48
makes a big mistake and they feel bad about it and it hurts them or they get people fired

1042
01:43:38.48 --> 01:43:43.12
they cost a bunch of money or something like you might not want to jump on their back immediately

1043
01:43:46.96 --> 01:43:52.40
a man remains a man after he puts on a soldier suit death in the company is like a death in the

1044
01:43:52.40 --> 01:44:00.48
family talk relieves tension okay talk relieves tension this is a tough one because guess what

1045
01:44:00.48 --> 01:44:04.08
some people when something bad happens you know what they want to do they want to be left alone

1046
01:44:05.12 --> 01:44:09.76
and yet it's talked that relieves tension and getting that out of which i agree with but

1047
01:44:10.88 --> 01:44:14.40
again you gotta be tactful there's a dichotomy you just can't go hey man or you really want to

1048
01:44:14.40 --> 01:44:17.68
talk to you about what happened it's like hey maybe that person needs a little time maybe

1049
01:44:17.68 --> 01:44:20.16
that person needs a little space but you can't give them too much time because they're going to

1050
01:44:20.16 --> 01:44:27.84
sit there and dwell on it so pay attention the unit which fights successful action but is

1051
01:44:27.84 --> 01:44:33.12
without knowledge of its success may even ensure a great victory for some larger body and still

1052
01:44:33.12 --> 01:44:39.52
emerge from the battlefield with a feeling of inferiority it's a complex sentence but what are you saying

1053
01:44:39.52 --> 01:44:43.92
is like you make sure when your people do something good you tell them because there's a lot of

1054
01:44:43.92 --> 01:44:48.000
times where people don't people don't understand what they did and how big of an impact it had

1055
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:57.20
and that's bad mmm here's a good one in combat nothing succeeds like success the knowledge of

1056
01:44:57.20 --> 01:45:04.88
victory is the beginning of a conviction of superiority just as truly the saver of one small triumph

1057
01:45:04.88 --> 01:45:12.96
will wholly drive out the bitter taste of any number of demoralizing defeats nothing succeeds like success

1058
01:45:12.96 --> 01:45:24.32
now we get in this section tactical cohesion important I think about that you know there's a

1059
01:45:24.32 --> 01:45:29.20
story and extreme ownership about the boat crews in the boat crew doing well and sometimes people

1060
01:45:29.20 --> 01:45:33.92
say what you know what do the guy that do do different well the new leader do and I always say well

1061
01:45:33.92 --> 01:45:39.60
what he got the team to do is get everyone in the boat rolling the boat in the same direction

1062
01:45:39.60 --> 01:45:45.04
at the same time like if you can do that you're winning if you can do that as a leader if you can

1063
01:45:45.04 --> 01:45:50.32
get everybody in the boat rolling the boat in the same direction at the same time you're going to win

1064
01:45:51.44 --> 01:45:55.20
and you'd be surprised how often I see companies I see business I see military units where

1065
01:45:55.20 --> 01:46:00.72
people are not rolling the boat in the same direction at the same time so that's what tactical

1066
01:46:00.72 --> 01:46:06.72
cohesion is tactical he's just how can we get people to be working together and here we go

1067
01:46:06.72 --> 01:46:13.20
getting the troops to that cohesiveness back to the book it may be done through one bold individual

1068
01:46:13.20 --> 01:46:20.72
standing erect and saying to a few others follow me we are going on if a few rise and follow

1069
01:46:20.72 --> 01:46:26.80
the entire line is apt to get in motion on the other hand if this same individual advances alone

1070
01:46:26.80 --> 01:46:33.12
but says nothing it is unlikely that he will have any followers one word come makes his action

1071
01:46:33.12 --> 01:46:40.32
tenfold as effective as if he plunges gauntly ahead in silence the act of moving is initiative

1072
01:46:40.32 --> 01:46:51.28
the act of coupling motion with speech is thinking initiative and important very important

1073
01:46:53.52 --> 01:46:57.92
here's talk about getting a gunfight the first thing you do is you hit the ground as reestablish

1074
01:46:57.92 --> 01:47:02.16
contact with your men determine where they are and let them know where you are this this happens

1075
01:47:02.16 --> 01:47:06.08
in business to something bad happens and we all go into panic mode and start focusing on

1076
01:47:06.08 --> 01:47:09.92
our world as a leader you need to say okay guys here's what's going on here's where I am here's what we're

1077
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:19.12
going to do leadership leadership leadership leadership leadership the majority of small unit leaders

1078
01:47:19.12 --> 01:47:24.16
do not take any steps toward restoring control from which alone can come unity of action

1079
01:47:24.16 --> 01:47:28.48
some try to contact their men by voice or by relay a voice during an action while the

1080
01:47:28.48 --> 01:47:33.68
matter prone the voice will rarely carry more than 25 feet this means that unless there is a relay

1081
01:47:33.68 --> 01:47:39.52
of all hands under and and all hands understand what is being attempted the voice method is ineffective

1082
01:47:40.56 --> 01:47:46.72
in the seal teams when somebody yells out a command everybody says it and it's the best it's the coolest

1083
01:47:46.72 --> 01:47:52.96
thing it's not the coolest thing but it's pretty cool when you hear that word getting past

1084
01:47:52.96 --> 01:47:58.56
and you hear the criticalness of an important command coming out and everybody says it and

1085
01:47:58.56 --> 01:48:03.44
the it's just that's what you have to do and we're so well trained at that that's one of the

1086
01:48:03.44 --> 01:48:08.16
few tactical things that you learn in basic underwater demolition seal training is you better

1087
01:48:08.16 --> 01:48:13.84
pass the word pass the word man it's one of those things it's one of those things you learn to pass the

1088
01:48:13.84 --> 01:48:24.24
word this is this is a great point the company coming under fire literally begins its engagement

1089
01:48:24.24 --> 01:48:28.96
by falling apart so when you start getting shot at guess what you do you get down you can't say

1090
01:48:28.96 --> 01:48:33.52
anyone else and you don't know what's happening so your first thing that happens when you get

1091
01:48:33.52 --> 01:48:39.28
engaged is you fall apart there after so long as it continues to engage the overriding

1092
01:48:39.28 --> 01:48:43.12
problem of the commander is the reunification of his elements this is a great way to think about

1093
01:48:43.12 --> 01:48:49.60
all your tactical leaders out there military police firefighters this is important think about this

1094
01:48:50.72 --> 01:48:54.80
after the thing after the engagement starts the overriding problem of the commander is the

1095
01:48:54.80 --> 01:49:00.72
reunification of his elements proper fire support and direction are coming are among the

1096
01:49:00.72 --> 01:49:06.48
tools which he uses and bringing about cohesion but the fundamental means is communication

1097
01:49:06.48 --> 01:49:11.44
getting his men to link up by talking to one another and sending a long word of what they are

1098
01:49:11.44 --> 01:49:20.32
doing and what they have seen now this is a very simple thing it is so simple that it recalls

1099
01:49:20.32 --> 01:49:30.40
the warning from kernel GFR Henderson in war the simple things are the most difficult past the

1100
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:40.08
part we say that we seek initiative in our men that is the American way of fighting we say that we want

1101
01:49:40.08 --> 01:49:45.68
men who can think and act we are just as steadfast however in proclaiming that the supreme

1102
01:49:45.68 --> 01:49:52.96
object in training is to produce unity of action these two aims are not mutually exclusive in fact

1103
01:49:52.96 --> 01:49:59.92
they are complementary halves of an enlightened battle discipline so do you catch that we want our people to act

1104
01:50:00.96 --> 01:50:04.96
we want our people to act for themselves we want them to think and act and at the same time we want

1105
01:50:04.96 --> 01:50:10.48
uniform unified unity of command we want them to be working together so we want them to act alone

1106
01:50:10.48 --> 01:50:15.04
we want them to work together there's obviously a dichotomy there there's a complementary halves

1107
01:50:15.04 --> 01:50:21.28
of an enlightened battle testament here we go this is beautiful but the various curious part of it

1108
01:50:21.28 --> 01:50:27.68
is that is that training largely ignores the soul principle which makes these two basic ideas

1109
01:50:27.68 --> 01:50:35.36
fully and finally reconcilable we do not teach our men from the day they first put on the uniform

1110
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:40.40
that speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat

1111
01:50:40.40 --> 01:50:52.96
speech in combat is as vital as fire in combat we do not say to them that for a man to be

1112
01:50:52.96 --> 01:50:58.32
able to think straight about his tactical situation is not enough he must communicate his thoughts

1113
01:50:58.32 --> 01:51:06.80
to others before they can begin to produce unity of action out of speech or from the written

1114
01:51:06.80 --> 01:51:14.40
word which is it's substitute comes all unification of strength on the battle field and from the latter

1115
01:51:14.40 --> 01:51:20.24
comes the decisive action this applies to two men serving together on an outpost it applies equally

1116
01:51:20.24 --> 01:51:30.16
to the battalion or the regiment right there right there if you can't communicate with the other

1117
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:35.04
people and people don't spread the word and your team doesn't communicate well with each other

1118
01:51:35.04 --> 01:51:43.20
you're not going to be able to join these two halves which is acting and being decisive and

1119
01:51:43.20 --> 01:51:52.48
being using initiative and cohesiveness of your unit the question still remains what kind of

1120
01:51:52.48 --> 01:51:59.12
initiative is beneficial and what kind is harmful and how may troops be might might be taught

1121
01:51:59.12 --> 01:52:04.08
to distinguish between the two right so could a person on your in your cartoon takes so much

1122
01:52:04.08 --> 01:52:10.32
initiative that it hurts oh yes they can I see many times before many times before I've seen that

1123
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:16.40
so the question is how do we know how much there's a dichotomy right we want people to action

1124
01:52:16.40 --> 01:52:20.48
but we don't don't want to take too much action I'm glad I'm not the book that got me the

1125
01:52:20.48 --> 01:52:28.80
issue yeah and here's here's his way of trying to define that is the soldier acting on his own

1126
01:52:28.80 --> 01:52:34.64
to advise others of his tactical situation or conveying any other information which may be of general

1127
01:52:34.64 --> 01:52:40.72
benefit in furthering the tactical situation of the company or in enlisting the aid of others

1128
01:52:40.72 --> 01:52:47.92
in carrying out any action which will benefit the tactical situation of the company so you you

1129
01:52:47.92 --> 01:52:51.76
need to take action you need to take initiative as long as it's benefiting the company

1130
01:52:53.04 --> 01:52:56.32
as long as you're and you know what we talk about as commanders intent like you can do whatever

1131
01:52:56.32 --> 01:52:59.92
you want as long as it's in support of commanders intent if it's non-support of commanders intent we

1132
01:52:59.92 --> 01:53:10.80
get a problem in the army of the United States we act towards speech as if it were mortally as if we

1133
01:53:10.80 --> 01:53:16.08
were mortally afraid of it we tell our men to think yet we never tell them that if in combat they

1134
01:53:16.08 --> 01:53:26.08
remain dumb it is slow suicide slow suicide the period between wars was an age of rapid

1135
01:53:26.08 --> 01:53:30.32
advancement in communications technique radio was born the telephone was vastly improved the

1136
01:53:30.32 --> 01:53:35.68
teleprinter appeared in television waited just around the corner it all came so fast that we were

1137
01:53:35.68 --> 01:53:46.96
struck dumb by our own magic how brilliant is that we were struck dumb by our magic how many people

1138
01:53:46.96 --> 01:53:52.72
these days are are be not becoming good communicators because they're not interacting with people

1139
01:53:52.72 --> 01:53:59.68
enough because instead of talking to them they're sending them an email that how is that affecting us

1140
01:54:00.32 --> 01:54:05.36
pretty much everybody pretty much everybody I'm one of the people you've got emojis coming

1141
01:54:05.36 --> 01:54:10.000
up right we got issues I don't know that might be in the step in the right direction right that

1142
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:16.08
additional emojis additional communication you know what it is it does add some clarity to your

1143
01:54:16.08 --> 01:54:24.32
statements you know you credit maybe I need to get an emoji game maybe not out but you know that's

1144
01:54:24.32 --> 01:54:28.72
a great thing to talk about raising kids to make sure you talk to your kids I work with someone

1145
01:54:28.72 --> 01:54:35.04
once had had a kid that had like a speech impediment and this kid would just sit down and talk

1146
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:42.24
your ear off with speech impediment and and I talked to the parent and said hey you got one

1147
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:47.44
confident kid you know with speech impediment how did you get him to overcome you know this

1148
01:54:48.24 --> 01:54:52.48
this speech impediment or the it's not so much the speech impediment because he didn't overcome

1149
01:54:52.48 --> 01:54:55.84
it's still had it but guess what was going to talk your ear off and was going to sit down

1150
01:54:55.84 --> 01:55:01.44
and act professional and get it convey his message and the response was got him to talk to people

1151
01:55:01.44 --> 01:55:08.56
all the time and and made him talk to people and so that's what you do get have conversation

1152
01:55:08.56 --> 01:55:14.56
with your kids how's that you have conversations with your people on your team how's that

1153
01:55:17.44 --> 01:55:22.56
is that one of the reasons why podcasts are popular because you get to hear conversations between

1154
01:55:22.56 --> 01:55:29.68
people because you're not here and then otherwise yeah maybe here's he's saying uh this is just

1155
01:55:29.68 --> 01:55:33.12
good advice for this is good you follow you folks that are thinking about joining the military

1156
01:55:33.12 --> 01:55:38.08
here we go when you prepare to fight you must prepare to talk you must learn that speech will

1157
01:55:38.08 --> 01:55:43.84
help you save your situation you must be alert at all times to let others know what is happening to you

1158
01:55:43.84 --> 01:55:50.80
you must use your brain and your voice anytime that any word of yours will help you or others

1159
01:55:50.80 --> 01:55:56.64
you are a tactical unit and you must think of yourself that way don't try to win a war or

1160
01:55:56.64 --> 01:56:02.24
capture a hill all by yourself your action alone means nothing or at best very little

1161
01:56:03.20 --> 01:56:08.32
is when you talk to others and they join with you that your action becomes important

1162
01:56:10.40 --> 01:56:12.40
got to communicate

1163
01:56:12.40 --> 01:56:21.84
this is life tells the story about me telling him to use verbal commands and we've got

1164
01:56:21.84 --> 01:56:25.52
that story over and over again because I've done it with so many different people like you

1165
01:56:25.52 --> 01:56:31.60
need to you need to use your man voice right now like you're not being loud enough and that was

1166
01:56:31.60 --> 01:56:36.24
a classic example of that you know life trying to communicate over the radio and people are

1167
01:56:36.24 --> 01:56:40.000
really listening because it's put noise in your ears and all these things happen and you're

1168
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.64
you know you're here little voice and in the sealed teams like I said we're so trained to repeat

1169
01:56:44.64 --> 01:56:50.16
those commands and I'm like life you gotta try using verbal commands bro you gotta try it and he

1170
01:56:50.16 --> 01:56:55.20
kind of looked at me like man I'm given the perfect brief over the radio right now my man will respond

1171
01:56:56.16 --> 01:57:00.48
and so finally you know he's you know angry lathe came out and he's got it and you're

1172
01:57:00.48 --> 01:57:05.44
everyone yelled and everyone repeated and everything happened and it was one of those things and

1173
01:57:05.44 --> 01:57:13.28
that's I mean this is what 10 years ago 15 12 years ago but it was definitely we all had radios on

1174
01:57:13.28 --> 01:57:17.52
and everybody every single person had a nice radio the same radio that's being used today

1175
01:57:17.52 --> 01:57:21.84
with a with a noise canceling headset do you know what that is? Yes, right. Okay yeah so I know

1176
01:57:21.84 --> 01:57:26.40
he's canceling it so you'd think what could be better than that what could be better than this

1177
01:57:26.40 --> 01:57:30.96
brand new modern technology with a noise canceling headset you know it's better than that your voice

1178
01:57:30.96 --> 01:57:35.52
Yeah yeah, yeah. I'd think that's saying a lot with the voice canceling headset and even even

1179
01:57:35.52 --> 01:57:42.000
then the voice is better. Yeah, well when you got the noise canceling headset it shuts off the sound.

1180
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.84
So when you're shooting your gun there's no sound coming in now you don't hear whatever's being told you

1181
01:57:49.12 --> 01:57:49.28
check

1182
01:57:50.16 --> 01:57:54.48
Alright one final statement on that men governed by words

1183
01:57:54.48 --> 01:58:00.20
speech galvanizes the desire to work together is the beginning of the urge to get

1184
01:58:00.20 --> 01:58:09.76
something done. So learn how to communicate. Read Study English. Learn how to write.

1185
01:58:09.76 --> 01:58:15.08
It's going to make you better communicator. All right. Now we go to Why Men Fight.

1186
01:58:15.08 --> 01:58:21.16
When a retrograde movement becomes necessary in combat, it is an invitation to

1187
01:58:21.16 --> 01:58:27.000
disaster to move before the men are told why they are moving. If the pressure is made,

1188
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.88
the fact that that fact obvious, then they still must be told how far to go and the

1189
01:58:31.88 --> 01:58:35.72
line or point to which they're withdrawing must be made clear and unmistakable.

1190
01:58:35.72 --> 01:58:40.68
Otherwise, they will keep moving and all control will be lost. The spoken word is

1191
01:58:40.68 --> 01:58:47.04
the greatest of studying forces in any time of crisis. Think about that. The spoken

1192
01:58:47.04 --> 01:58:53.44
word is the greatest of studying forces in any time of crisis. An excited lieutenant

1193
01:58:53.44 --> 01:58:57.60
shouting, get that out of here and follow me to that tree. If follow me to that tree

1194
01:58:57.60 --> 01:59:03.60
line on the far side of the creek, we'll succeed. The little perfectly calm captain

1195
01:59:03.60 --> 01:59:08.76
trying to bring off the same movement but keeping his voice down with the result

1196
01:59:08.76 --> 01:59:14.92
that the men do not hear him will fail. That's obvious. Formal language under these

1197
01:59:14.92 --> 01:59:20.32
circumstances is almost unknown in the army of the United States. In fact, get the hell out

1198
01:59:20.32 --> 01:59:30.20
of here has virtually established itself in our jargon as the customary order.

1199
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:39.28
Said, dren general dragon, dragon mirroh. A strong moral education is the best safeguard

1200
01:59:39.28 --> 01:59:45.64
to solidarity of troops under fire. Even so, the soldier will forget or discount much

1201
01:59:45.64 --> 01:59:52.12
that training has taught him as the danger mounts and fear takes hold. It is then the

1202
01:59:52.12 --> 02:00:00.88
voice of the leader must cut through fear to remind him of what is required. The reason

1203
02:00:00.88 --> 02:00:07.36
to explanation of why this is true has never been more clearly stated than by staff sergeant

1204
02:00:07.36 --> 02:00:14.84
Pete F. Dyne of the 17th Infantry Regiment after he had won the silver star for taking over

1205
02:00:14.84 --> 02:00:22.000
the leading of a demoralized platoon during the Burton Island fight.

1206
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:27.12
And here's staff sergeant Pete Dyne. I knew that the men were afraid and careless at the

1207
02:00:27.12 --> 02:00:32.60
same time. Though some were being killed, the others would not take even average precautions

1208
02:00:32.60 --> 02:00:38.92
in going after the enemy installations as we passed through them. I knew they were afraid

1209
02:00:38.92 --> 02:00:46.000
because I was aware of my own fear. Then I asked myself why it was that we felt fear in

1210
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:52.76
each other and I realized it was because all of the leaders had quit talking. I knew

1211
02:00:52.76 --> 02:00:57.40
then that the only way to get confidence back into the platoon was to talk it up as a man

1212
02:00:57.40 --> 02:01:03.40
might do in a football game. I continued my own attack on the enemy shelters and spider

1213
02:01:03.40 --> 02:01:10.08
holes, but there was a difference. That now began yet that I've now began yelling to

1214
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:15.40
others. Watch me. This is what your supposed to do. Get at it. Keep working. Keep your eyes

1215
02:01:15.40 --> 02:01:21.96
open. Soon the platoon became collected and began to operate methodically. But I kept

1216
02:01:21.96 --> 02:01:27.72
talking until the end because I had learned something new. Leaders must talk if they are to

1217
02:01:27.72 --> 02:01:40.36
lead. Action is not enough. A silent example will never rally men. Get some or get at it.

1218
02:01:40.36 --> 02:01:45.32
In battle, back to the book. In battle, the voice of the leader is always needed to call

1219
02:01:45.32 --> 02:01:52.12
back the man from carelessness. It is their chronic attitude in and out of danger. Even in veteran

1220
02:01:52.12 --> 02:01:57.56
troops, it is not expected. It is not the expected presence of the enemy, which keeps them

1221
02:01:57.56 --> 02:02:04.84
alert on a hostile field, but the force with which they feel pressing them at any given moment.

1222
02:02:04.84 --> 02:02:09.88
When fire comes against them, they sense danger from every direction unless they are informed

1223
02:02:09.88 --> 02:02:15.88
of the source of the danger. There is apt to occur swift moral transition in which they become

1224
02:02:15.88 --> 02:02:21.96
mentally pinned by the mere incidents of fire. Like that's a mentally pinned. You don't know

1225
02:02:21.96 --> 02:02:28.92
what's going on. So this was interesting. On seven occasions, it has been part of my duty to

1226
02:02:28.92 --> 02:02:34.12
investigate the sources of panic along the battle line twice in the Pacific in five times in

1227
02:02:34.12 --> 02:02:41.16
Europe. There was times where people just panicked and left the line and he had to investigate them.

1228
02:02:43.24 --> 02:02:47.88
And he goes into that was how each of these incidents, each of these seven incidents got

1229
02:02:47.88 --> 02:02:55.08
it start. One or two or two or more men made a sudden run to the rear, which others in the vicinity

1230
02:02:55.08 --> 02:03:01.000
did not understand. But it was the lack of information rather than the sight of running men,

1231
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.12
which was the crux of the danger. For in every case, the testimony of all witnesses clearly

1232
02:03:06.12 --> 02:03:11.64
developed the fact that those who started the run and thereby spread the fear which started the

1233
02:03:11.64 --> 02:03:17.96
panic had a legitimate or at least reasonable excuse for the action. It was not the sudden motion

1234
02:03:17.96 --> 02:03:24.60
which of itself did not did the damage, but the fact that the others present were not kept informed.

1235
02:03:24.60 --> 02:03:33.80
Got it, you people got to know what's going on. For example, a sergeant in the first battalion

1236
02:03:33.80 --> 02:03:42.76
502nd Infantry was hit through an artery during the Carratin caused way fight on June 12, 1944.

1237
02:03:42.76 --> 02:03:47.32
It happened in a flash. One second he was hit and the next he was running for a first aid

1238
02:03:47.32 --> 02:03:53.16
station without telling his own squad why he was getting out. They took out after him and then

1239
02:03:53.16 --> 02:03:58.60
the line broke. Others who hadn't seen the sergeant make his dash saw someone else in flight.

1240
02:03:58.60 --> 02:04:04.68
They ran too. Someone said the order is to withdraw. Others picked up the word and cried it

1241
02:04:04.68 --> 02:04:11.16
along the line with draw, with draw. It happened just as simply as that. You can see how that happened

1242
02:04:11.16 --> 02:04:18.36
all day long, right? The term control is not in this instance to be considered as synonymous

1243
02:04:18.36 --> 02:04:23.96
with the voice of authority. Control is a man to man force on the battlefield. No matter how

1244
02:04:23.96 --> 02:04:29.32
lonely his rank any man who controls himself automatically contributes to the control of others.

1245
02:04:30.76 --> 02:04:36.28
That's legit. Any man who controls himself automatically contributes to the control of others.

1246
02:04:36.28 --> 02:04:43.96
Fear is contagious, but so, but courage is not less so. To the man who is in terror and

1247
02:04:43.96 --> 02:04:49.96
virgin on panic no influence can be more steady than that he sees some other man near him who is

1248
02:04:49.96 --> 02:04:57.32
retaining self control and doing his duty. It's weird how people are just so influenced by other

1249
02:04:57.32 --> 02:05:07.56
people. Let me see it everywhere. Personal honor is the one thing valued more than life itself

1250
02:05:07.56 --> 02:05:13.48
by the majority of men. The lips of the dying attest how strongly this force influences

1251
02:05:13.48 --> 02:05:21.72
individual conduct in battle. A young company runner hit by a shell at Carataine collapsed into

1252
02:05:21.72 --> 02:05:28.12
the arms of his commander and with his life swiftly abing said captain this company always called

1253
02:05:28.12 --> 02:05:35.72
me a screw up. Tell me that I wasn't. Tell me that I wasn't one this time. The captain replied

1254
02:05:35.72 --> 02:05:45.72
no son you sure weren't and the board died with a smile on his face. The Wallen army is a collection

1255
02:05:45.72 --> 02:05:52.36
of individuals. It is also a crowd under pressure and under pressure it tends to ever to

1256
02:05:52.36 --> 02:05:58.28
revert to crowd form. The seeds of panic are always present in troops so long as they are in

1257
02:05:58.28 --> 02:06:03.96
the midst of physical danger. The form of which changes moment to moment. In the majority of men

1258
02:06:03.96 --> 02:06:09.64
the retention of self discipline under the conditions of the battlefield depends on the maintaining

1259
02:06:09.64 --> 02:06:18.68
of an appearance of discipline within the unit. So obviously with businesses and with businesses

1260
02:06:18.68 --> 02:06:22.76
you're going to business that like people are squared away. That's how they roll. And everyone

1261
02:06:22.76 --> 02:06:28.68
acts squared away and you get some people that aren't and that's the image that's the culture

1262
02:06:28.68 --> 02:06:36.12
of the company and no one squared away. Should the latter begin to dissolve so should the

1263
02:06:36.12 --> 02:06:40.36
discipline within the unit begin to dissolve only a small minority of the most hardy individuals

1264
02:06:40.36 --> 02:06:45.64
will retain self control. The others cannot stand fast if the circumstances appear to justify

1265
02:06:45.64 --> 02:06:52.60
flight. When other men flee the social pressure is lifted and the average soldier will respond

1266
02:06:52.60 --> 02:06:56.76
as if he has been given a free release from duty. For he knows that his personal failure is made

1267
02:06:56.76 --> 02:07:05.08
inconspicuous by the general dissolution. To it is a normal tendency in troops that they will

1268
02:07:05.08 --> 02:07:11.80
drift rearward from the fire line unless they are being given an active direction. But it is

1269
02:07:11.80 --> 02:07:16.12
just as normal that they will reverse themselves quickly and return to their duty if given a firm

1270
02:07:16.12 --> 02:07:23.48
order by someone whom they know. Yeah and if you're a business situation we just like put out word

1271
02:07:23.48 --> 02:07:29.64
like like just something stupid like like you'll be in a store or something and people people will

1272
02:07:29.64 --> 02:07:35.000
be like not knowing hey there's just someone say hey there's a register over here or like you're

1273
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:40.84
at a waiting and a line at a and a public event of some kind you know. Hey wrap this thing around

1274
02:07:40.84 --> 02:07:47.72
wrap the line around and everyone just does it. Yeah yeah like it's a thing to kind of what you're

1275
02:07:47.72 --> 02:07:53.80
talking about to be like at the airport. The day I was super late. Remember to get a lot of planes.

1276
02:07:53.80 --> 02:07:59.24
You're gonna watch the DC and went to the wrong airport. Last minute. Last second by the way.

1277
02:07:59.24 --> 02:08:07.72
Anyway I'm standing in the TSA line. I see super long by the way. When I see super long I mean like

1278
02:08:07.72 --> 02:08:13.32
like you ain't got to make it flat. Yeah this long long like a long line like there was a crowd.

1279
02:08:13.32 --> 02:08:17.40
Yeah. So I'm standing in line. I'm like you know when you're in a hurry you're always looking

1280
02:08:17.40 --> 02:08:22.68
for a little shortcuts and I'll violate a few rules you know to get there quicker so I'm on the

1281
02:08:22.68 --> 02:08:29.56
lookout. Everyone else is just cruising just falling in line literally. So I look and I see a weird

1282
02:08:29.56 --> 02:08:36.92
sort of line start of kind of the forming. Wait shorter too like the kind like I can like

1283
02:08:36.92 --> 02:08:44.12
literally literally walk about 15 meters. I had to the end of this weird little line forming.

1284
02:08:44.12 --> 02:08:48.44
Ever see it? It's a little line but it's kind of like one of the things I go about what we're doing

1285
02:08:48.44 --> 02:08:53.32
and I think the lines make it even more psychologically rigid you know where it's like we're in line

1286
02:08:53.32 --> 02:08:58.04
and to get out of line that's a kind of a big deal. Yeah well it's the social what is you call in it here.

1287
02:08:58.04 --> 02:09:05.88
The social you get the release from social duty right. Yeah oh yeah yeah if you're

1288
02:09:05.88 --> 02:09:09.08
showing everyone saying in line and you're just doing whatever else there's like a social

1289
02:09:09.08 --> 02:09:14.12
pressure to stay in line. Yes exactly right so but boy man I was doing a mischief like so

1290
02:09:16.28 --> 02:09:22.60
I ask oh how's this I ask the guy not like in that line because it's where ahead I ask

1291
02:09:22.60 --> 02:09:28.12
the guy in the next line who's like maybe two three people ahead of me but in a different line.

1292
02:09:28.12 --> 02:09:33.72
I was like is that another line and he you know he says he said yeah it is he goes yeah it is

1293
02:09:33.72 --> 02:09:38.84
so I go I just go he already knew it but then he was like standing it like he didn't do it

1294
02:09:38.84 --> 02:09:43.96
probably from that social pressure so of course I go and then everyone falls. I look behind everyone

1295
02:09:43.96 --> 02:09:49.72
I feel like a commotion behind me but it's just so many people feeling in that's how freaking leading

1296
02:09:49.72 --> 02:09:55.88
from the bottom and it made the flight by literally like what 10 seconds probably you're close.

1297
02:09:55.88 --> 02:10:04.84
Yeah. This is again I kind of covered this moment ahead at one more time.

1298
02:10:04.84 --> 02:10:10.52
Individuals, Traggers had almost no combat value and inducted into a strange organization.

1299
02:10:10.52 --> 02:10:15.48
The majority of them were unwilling to join any such solid unit which still facing the enemy.

1300
02:10:15.48 --> 02:10:21.000
The minority even after being given food and a little rest took their place in line but the moment

1301
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.20
the new unit came under enemy pressure the individuals quit their ground and ran rearward or

1302
02:10:26.20 --> 02:10:31.80
sought cover behind somewhere behind the combat line. So this is what I would talk about. You get a new

1303
02:10:31.80 --> 02:10:35.56
person and they don't know anyone they're not going to do their job on the other hand. This is

1304
02:10:35.56 --> 02:10:40.36
important for businesses on the other hand that was not true of gun crews squad groups or

1305
02:10:40.36 --> 02:10:45.08
Paltoon which had been routed from their original ground and separate from their parent unit but had

1306
02:10:45.08 --> 02:10:50.92
managed in some way to hold together during a fallback upon being inducted into a strange

1307
02:10:50.92 --> 02:10:56.20
company they tended to fight as vigorously as any element in the command which they had newly joined

1308
02:10:56.20 --> 02:11:01.48
and would frequently set an example of initiative and courageous action beyond what had been

1309
02:11:01.48 --> 02:11:08.28
asked of them. Think about that. Keep your little elements together. I used to be real big on that.

1310
02:11:08.92 --> 02:11:13.16
You got your little fire teams and I was always trying to keep a little fire team integrity.

1311
02:11:13.16 --> 02:11:18.52
Keep that fire team integrity. And these are like in a sealed tune there's four fire teams in

1312
02:11:18.52 --> 02:11:22.52
a task unit. You know there's eight fire teams trying to keep these guys still know each other but

1313
02:11:22.52 --> 02:11:25.88
they're going to do a little bit better. They just keep that fire team integrity. No each other.

1314
02:11:25.88 --> 02:11:33.88
They already know what's up. In our striving for a system of discipline which recognizes in theory

1315
02:11:34.60 --> 02:11:38.60
they'll the theories offered in order to practice that the relationships within our army should be

1316
02:11:38.60 --> 02:11:45.40
based upon intimate understanding between officers and men rather than familiarity between them

1317
02:11:45.40 --> 02:11:52.76
on self-respect rather than fear and above all on uniting comradeship.

1318
02:11:55.88 --> 02:12:04.20
Self-respect rather than fear. This is they have destroyed the name and tradition of old and

1319
02:12:04.20 --> 02:12:10.68
honored regiments with the stroke of a pen for convenience sake. They have uprooted the names and

1320
02:12:10.68 --> 02:12:17.96
numbers which had identity with a certain soil and move them willy nilly to another soil.

1321
02:12:17.96 --> 02:12:23.32
They have moved men around as if they were pegs and nothing counted but a specialist classification

1322
02:12:23.32 --> 02:12:28.76
number. They have become fillers of holes rather than architects of human spirit.

1323
02:12:30.44 --> 02:12:36.92
That's bold, isn't it? Yes, you like them. I do. So sometimes in the army and the army does this

1324
02:12:36.92 --> 02:12:43.32
more than anyone else I believe. They'll just like take a unit that's been around for 122 years

1325
02:12:43.32 --> 02:12:47.96
and fought in all kinds of wars and just disband them. They're done. Just get rid of them.

1326
02:12:47.96 --> 02:12:55.000
And sometimes they bring them back thankfully but that's not a good idea. There's a certain power

1327
02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:03.48
in tradition. There's a certain power in tradition. When they formed up Seal Team 5 they took

1328
02:13:03.48 --> 02:13:11.64
they took Seal Team or sorry underwater demolition team 11 and they disbanded it and basically

1329
02:13:11.64 --> 02:13:18.60
reformed it as Seal Team 5. But if you look at the symbol of Seal Team 5 there's a setting

1330
02:13:18.60 --> 02:13:23.40
son and on the setting son is the number 11. You can see it go down. Little will fact for you.

1331
02:13:23.40 --> 02:13:29.32
Pretty cool. But they at least kept that tradition alive.

1332
02:13:29.32 --> 02:13:35.24
Yeah. And yes, this idea of fillers of holes rather than architects of human spirit.

1333
02:13:35.24 --> 02:13:37.64
You got to think about what you're doing with the little units when you start breaking them up and

1334
02:13:37.64 --> 02:13:41.56
moving people around. There's this there's relationships there that you're messing with. You might not be

1335
02:13:41.56 --> 02:13:44.52
doing a good thing just because this guy has a certain qualification. I'll put him over there.

1336
02:13:46.36 --> 02:13:51.000
They're in lies at great weakness and we have suffered from it through every war.

1337
02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:57.56
For it must ever remain that acquisition of a true knowledge of the nature of man in war will

1338
02:13:57.56 --> 02:14:02.92
suffice very little if put to work only by the local commander on limited ground.

1339
02:14:04.52 --> 02:14:09.40
So everybody's got to understand that there's human beings working here that you're dealing with

1340
02:14:09.40 --> 02:14:15.16
human that you have to be an architect of the human spirit. That again leaves too much to chance

1341
02:14:15.16 --> 02:14:18.84
and puts too high a premium in on the virtues and talents of the average leader.

1342
02:14:19.48 --> 02:14:23.88
What does need to primarily if we are to go forward the policy stemming from the top which are

1343
02:14:23.88 --> 02:14:30.68
based not upon slide rule calculations but on knowledge of the human heart.

1344
02:14:32.04 --> 02:14:38.68
Next chapter. The aggressive will. I like this little section.

1345
02:14:39.48 --> 02:14:47.40
Moral is the thinking of an army. It is the whole complex body of an army's thought. The way it

1346
02:14:47.40 --> 02:14:52.92
feels about the soil and about the people from which it springs. The way that it feels about

1347
02:14:52.92 --> 02:14:58.60
their cause and their politics is compared with other causes and other politics. The way that it

1348
02:14:58.60 --> 02:15:04.52
feels about its friends and allies as well as its enemies, about its commanders and gold bricks.

1349
02:15:05.16 --> 02:15:11.80
About food and shelter, duty and leisure, militarism and civilianism, freedom and slavery,

1350
02:15:11.80 --> 02:15:20.52
work and want weapons and comradeship, bunk fatigue and drill, discipline and disorder, life and death,

1351
02:15:20.52 --> 02:15:27.56
God and the devil. That's a big, that's a big, that's what he's saying.

1352
02:15:28.12 --> 02:15:34.36
Like you've got human beings and the morale of the army is all of that stuff combined together.

1353
02:15:34.36 --> 02:15:42.28
You have to account for it. The definition cuts through one of the oldest myths in the military

1354
02:15:42.28 --> 02:15:52.20
book that morale comes from discipline. The process is precisely the reverse. True discipline is

1355
02:15:52.20 --> 02:16:02.76
the product of morale. Right? I never really thought about that too much. How's your morale?

1356
02:16:04.20 --> 02:16:08.44
If you have good morale, you're going to have better discipline. If your morale is weak,

1357
02:16:08.44 --> 02:16:18.68
what happens to your discipline goes out the window? The soldier needs a sound and vigorous body

1358
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:24.60
if he is to contend in modern war. But this itself should be the object rather than the

1359
02:16:24.60 --> 02:16:30.20
perfecting of him in drills, not even remotely related to use of his weapons, out of a mistaken

1360
02:16:30.20 --> 02:16:37.48
and obsolescent notion that they somehow improve his discipline. There's no such time for

1361
02:16:37.48 --> 02:16:43.96
the method, for this method. So doing stuff just to do it, to like improve your discipline,

1362
02:16:43.96 --> 02:16:49.48
is not what we're talking about here. Beyond the basic physical requirement, the essential is that

1363
02:16:49.48 --> 02:16:56.04
he be given the freedom to think with a clear mind which freedom can be his only when he becomes

1364
02:16:56.04 --> 02:17:00.28
convinced that the army and particularly the army as represented by his immediate

1365
02:17:00.28 --> 02:17:05.08
superiors is doing everything possible for his welfare. You've got to care about your people.

1366
02:17:05.08 --> 02:17:10.68
That's what Mook said. That's what Dezwit General Mookiama said. You've got to care about your people.

1367
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:17.48
Like 100% agree. Soldiers can endure hardship. Most of their training is directed toward

1368
02:17:17.48 --> 02:17:23.56
conditioning them for unusual privation and exertion, but no power on earth can reconcile

1369
02:17:23.56 --> 02:17:29.64
them to what common sense says is unnecessary hardship which might have been avoided by greater

1370
02:17:29.64 --> 02:17:38.28
intelligence in their superiors. That is awesome. If your people do all kinds of take all kinds

1371
02:17:38.28 --> 02:17:42.44
of punishment for you, but if they see that there's a way you could have avoided punishment for them

1372
02:17:42.44 --> 02:17:48.44
and you didn't do it because you were dumb, they're going to rebel against you. The more intelligent,

1373
02:17:48.44 --> 02:17:55.40
the more intelligent the soldier, the more likely it is that he will see as a sign, see that as a

1374
02:17:55.40 --> 02:18:01.88
sign of indiscipline up above and will answer it the same way. So if the upper chain of commands

1375
02:18:01.88 --> 02:18:04.76
drop in the ball, guess what's going to happen lower chain and where drop in the ball too.

1376
02:18:05.88 --> 02:18:11.48
Nothing more radical is suggested here than that the leader who would make certain of the

1377
02:18:11.48 --> 02:18:18.04
fundamental sound as of his operation cannot do better than concentrate his attention on his men.

1378
02:18:18.04 --> 02:18:27.48
That's a bold statement. There's nothing better you can do than concentrate your attention

1379
02:18:27.48 --> 02:18:33.40
on your men. If you want something to be successful, concentrate on your people. There is no

1380
02:18:33.40 --> 02:18:41.48
other worthwhile road. They do only themselves who believe that there is a brand of military

1381
02:18:41.48 --> 02:18:46.28
efficiency which consists in moving smartly expediting papers and achieving perfection

1382
02:18:46.28 --> 02:18:51.96
informations while at the same time sliding or ignoring the human nature of those who may command.

1383
02:18:53.64 --> 02:18:57.72
The art of leading in operations larger, small is the art of dealing with humanity

1384
02:18:59.24 --> 02:19:05.72
and working diligently on behalf of men, of being sympathetic with them, but equally of insisting

1385
02:19:05.72 --> 02:19:13.000
that they make a square facing toward their own problems. These are the real basis of commanders

1386
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:19.16
major calculations. That's just a awesome, that whole thing. The art of leading,

1387
02:19:20.12 --> 02:19:26.12
dealing with humanity, working diligently on behalf of your men, being sympathetic with them.

1388
02:19:26.76 --> 02:19:31.64
And at the same time dichotomy insisting that they make a square facing toward their own problems.

1389
02:19:33.64 --> 02:19:38.36
Men who have been in battle know from firsthand experience that when the chips are down a man

1390
02:19:38.36 --> 02:19:43.24
fights to help the man next to him, next to him, just as a company fights to keep pace with its

1391
02:19:43.24 --> 02:19:49.56
flanks. Things have to be that simple. And ideal does not become tangible at the moment of

1392
02:19:49.56 --> 02:19:59.80
firing a volley or charging a hill. Having already suggested that the thinking bayonets

1393
02:20:00.52 --> 02:20:05.48
can never be subordinated by the routine methods of a discipline which is based largely in

1394
02:20:05.48 --> 02:20:12.36
mechanical procedures, I will add that no leader will ever fail his troops, nor will they fail

1395
02:20:12.36 --> 02:20:15.72
him who leads them in respect for the discipline life.

1396
02:20:19.40 --> 02:20:26.84
Between these two things, discipline in itself and a personal faith in the military value of discipline

1397
02:20:26.84 --> 02:20:31.88
lies all the difference between military, maturity and mediocrity.

1398
02:20:31.88 --> 02:20:39.32
A salute from a willing soldier is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a tree.

1399
02:20:40.36 --> 02:20:45.64
It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by gust of wind, but a salute from the man

1400
02:20:45.64 --> 02:20:49.64
who takes pride in the gesture because he feels privileged to wear the uniform,

1401
02:20:49.64 --> 02:20:55.000
having found that service good is an act of the highest military virtue.

1402
02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:02.20
One further fact that needs to be stressed about the character of those officers whose

1403
02:21:02.20 --> 02:21:06.44
capacity could be measured in the efficiency of their companies while they were

1404
02:21:06.44 --> 02:21:10.68
scrupulous in the care of their men, they were not wet nurses.

1405
02:21:12.44 --> 02:21:19.56
They treated their subordinates as men. They did not regard them as adolescents and they did not employ

1406
02:21:19.56 --> 02:21:27.32
the classroom manner in dealing with them individually or in the mass. That was an important part

1407
02:21:28.36 --> 02:21:35.16
of their hold upon the men. The men prize a commander the more if he looks and acts the

1408
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:41.08
part of a soldier, but the characteristic of a fine appearance will but betray him the sooner

1409
02:21:41.64 --> 02:21:46.92
if he has no real canship with the men. So he, this is dichotomy. You got to take

1410
02:21:46.92 --> 02:21:51.72
air in your men, but you're not a wet nurse. You don't treat them like little kids.

1411
02:21:53.48 --> 02:21:59.000
The characteristics which are required in the minor commander if he is to prove capable of

1412
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.88
preparing men for and leading them through the shock of combat with high credit may therefore

1413
02:22:03.88 --> 02:22:10.44
be briefly described as one diligence in the care of men. So here's the characteristics.

1414
02:22:10.44 --> 02:22:15.64
Number one diligence in the care of men. Number two, administration of all organizational affairs

1415
02:22:15.64 --> 02:22:21.88
such as punishments and promotions according to a standard of resolute justice. Number three,

1416
02:22:21.88 --> 02:22:30.92
military bearing. Number four, a basic understanding of the simple fact that soldiers wish to

1417
02:22:30.92 --> 02:22:37.32
think of themselves as soldiers and that all military information is nourishing to their spirits and

1418
02:22:37.32 --> 02:22:49.000
their lives. Number five, courage, creative intelligence and physical fitness. Number six,

1419
02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:55.88
innate respect for the dignity of the position and the work of other men. I'm gonna tell you those

1420
02:22:55.88 --> 02:23:01.24
are some good rules. Some good things to think about if you're in a leadership position.

1421
02:23:01.24 --> 02:23:10.12
Here's a little commentary and it was written in 1947, might still be true today. It is my belief

1422
02:23:10.12 --> 02:23:16.12
that there is no more hopeful doctrine put before our people today than that the army should

1423
02:23:16.12 --> 02:23:22.76
duplicate the arrangements which obtain within the civil society, slavishly imitating the

1424
02:23:22.76 --> 02:23:30.20
latter's comforts, social customs and ideas of regulating justice and insisting on no higher standards

1425
02:23:30.20 --> 02:23:37.24
of personal responsibility for its people. So hey guess what, the military is not the civilian

1426
02:23:37.24 --> 02:23:41.96
world and we shouldn't be trying to make it that way. The military is the military.

1427
02:23:44.92 --> 02:23:49.88
That's 1947 he's saying that. I'm gonna have to say I agree.

1428
02:23:52.28 --> 02:23:57.72
In my opinion and I do not say this lightly, the fault in our disciplinary level during World War

1429
02:23:57.72 --> 02:24:03.16
II was not primarily that the discipline of the ranks needed to be more relaxed, but that the discipline

1430
02:24:03.16 --> 02:24:09.08
of a considerable percentage of our officers needed to be tightened. For this simple reason,

1431
02:24:09.08 --> 02:24:14.52
insofar as his ability to mold the character of troops is concerned, the qualifying test of an

1432
02:24:14.52 --> 02:24:20.52
officer is the judgment placed upon his soldierly abilities by those who serve under him.

1433
02:24:20.52 --> 02:24:32.04
You can only mold your troops if they judge you worthy of molding them. Think about that for a minute.

1434
02:24:33.80 --> 02:24:38.36
If they do not deem him fit to command he cannot train them to obey.

1435
02:24:40.20 --> 02:24:47.88
Thus, where slackness is tolerated in officership, it is a direct invitation to disobeyedience

1436
02:24:47.88 --> 02:24:53.08
and as disobedience multiplies all discipline disappears.

1437
02:24:58.04 --> 02:25:02.92
I love this little section right here. No officer can command unless he is certain of himself

1438
02:25:02.92 --> 02:25:08.36
and confident that his orders are likely to lead to success. On the other hand, command does not

1439
02:25:08.36 --> 02:25:15.000
create its own magic. Men who are filled with the spirit of disobedience will break the heart

1440
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.92
and ruin the character of the finest officer who ever lived. Men who deal with the rabble

1441
02:25:20.92 --> 02:25:30.12
browsers out there. You're going to deal with some tough cookies. The way in which the loss of

1442
02:25:30.12 --> 02:25:35.64
moral incentive is reflected in the tactile behavior of troops was thoughtfully expressed many

1443
02:25:35.64 --> 02:25:42.68
years ago by the British teacher Colonel GFR Henderson. When troops once realized they're in

1444
02:25:42.68 --> 02:25:49.000
fear-rewardy they can go they can no longer be dependent on. If attacking they refuse to advance

1445
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:54.60
if defending they abandon all hope of resistance. It is not the losses they have suffered,

1446
02:25:54.60 --> 02:25:59.64
but those they expect to suffer that affect them consequently unless discipline and national

1447
02:25:59.64 --> 02:26:05.32
spirit spirit are of superior quality and unless the soldier is animated by something higher than

1448
02:26:05.32 --> 02:26:12.20
the habit of mechanical obedience, panic, shirking and wholesale surrender will be the ordinary

1449
02:26:12.20 --> 02:26:22.44
features of the campaign. Pretty harsh warning. Nothing more unfortunate can happen to the commander

1450
02:26:22.44 --> 02:26:29.40
than to come to be regarded by his subordinates as unapproachable for such a reputation isolates him

1451
02:26:29.40 --> 02:26:34.84
from the main problems of command as well as its chief rewards. So you got to be approachable as a leader.

1452
02:26:35.88 --> 02:26:40.60
This saying there's nothing more unfortunate than being regarded as unapproachable. It is back

1453
02:26:40.60 --> 02:26:45.000
the book is never a waste of time for the commander to talk to his people about their problems.

1454
02:26:46.60 --> 02:26:51.64
Here's a good people ask me. I get all the junior leaders from the military from the civilian

1455
02:26:51.64 --> 02:26:56.52
sector from everywhere and they ask me what am I supposed to do? To the young officer whose conscious

1456
02:26:56.52 --> 02:27:02.12
of his own reserve and his anxious to do something about it I can suggest nothing better than to

1457
02:27:02.12 --> 02:27:09.16
make a habit of full physical participation. That is instead of watching the squad or a platoon

1458
02:27:09.16 --> 02:27:14.60
workout or problem and either directing or criticizing its action. Let him pick up a weapon,

1459
02:27:14.60 --> 02:27:20.04
relieve one man in the group, then let himself be the one commanded until the conclusion of the

1460
02:27:20.04 --> 02:27:26.36
operation. Is this course of contact beneath the dignity of the American officer? Certainly not.

1461
02:27:26.36 --> 02:27:29.96
So what does it get in the game? Getting the game.

1462
02:27:29.96 --> 02:27:40.04
In the United States Service we are tending to forget because of the effective motorization

1463
02:27:40.04 --> 02:27:47.24
that the higher value of discipline of the road march in other days that it wasn't that it

1464
02:27:47.24 --> 02:27:53.88
hardened muscles but that short of combat it was the best method of separating the men from the

1465
02:27:53.88 --> 02:27:59.56
boys. Always come back to a little road march action. Best method for separating a men from the

1466
02:27:59.56 --> 02:28:04.84
boys is the road march. This is true today. Despite all the new conditions imposed by

1467
02:28:04.84 --> 02:28:11.32
high velocity warfare, hard road march is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength

1468
02:28:11.32 --> 02:28:17.56
of the individual man. The great advantage of the gain in moral force through all forms of physical

1469
02:28:17.56 --> 02:28:23.96
training is that it is unconscious gain. All forms of physical training are going to give you an

1470
02:28:23.96 --> 02:28:30.68
unconscious gain of moral force. Let that propel your workout tomorrow morning. Will power,

1471
02:28:30.68 --> 02:28:35.96
determination, mental poison, mental control, all march hand in hand with the general health and

1472
02:28:35.96 --> 02:28:41.96
well-being of the man. Fatigue will beat men down as quickly as any other condition for

1473
02:28:41.96 --> 02:28:48.84
for fatigue brings fear with it. There is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the

1474
02:28:48.84 --> 02:28:55.32
road for lack of adequate preliminary hardening in troops. Such a condition cannot be redeemed by the

1475
02:28:55.32 --> 02:29:00.12
resolve of a commander who insists on driving troops in extra mile beyond their general level of

1476
02:29:00.12 --> 02:29:05.16
physical endurance. That's important to remember. If you've got people that aren't ready,

1477
02:29:05.16 --> 02:29:11.000
doesn't matter how much you try and make them do something they're not physically capable of doing it.

1478
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:18.52
That's the reality. Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command

1479
02:29:18.52 --> 02:29:25.32
and thus strike at the tactical efficiency from two directions at once. For when men resent

1480
02:29:25.32 --> 02:29:30.36
a commander they will not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent, their nerves are

1481
02:29:30.36 --> 02:29:36.04
gone. In this state, the soldiers every act is mechanical. He is reduced to that

1482
02:29:36.04 --> 02:29:43.16
animatism of mind which destroys physical response. His courage is killed. His intellect falls asleep.

1483
02:29:43.16 --> 02:29:51.64
Truly then it is killing men with kindness not to insist upon physical standards during training

1484
02:29:51.64 --> 02:29:58.12
which will give them a maximum fitness for the extraordinary stresses of campaigning in a war.

1485
02:30:00.12 --> 02:30:05.48
Killing men truly killing men with kindness not that they're physically ready. As the body is

1486
02:30:05.48 --> 02:30:10.28
hardened so must the mind be steadily informed so that the soldier will take a reasoning view

1487
02:30:10.28 --> 02:30:15.32
not only of the privations of the field but of that which is being attempted. Once we depart from

1488
02:30:15.32 --> 02:30:20.60
the ideal of automatic responses the condition most likely to produce unity of action in battle,

1489
02:30:20.60 --> 02:30:26.04
the only substitute for it lies in the possibility that more and more men in the ranks can be trained

1490
02:30:26.04 --> 02:30:31.72
to see and think through the haze of battle in unison with their commanders.

1491
02:30:34.36 --> 02:30:38.52
You can see, you can see, I mean when you read about face, there's the hack worth,

1492
02:30:38.52 --> 02:30:41.32
this is what hack worth did, man this is how hack worth rolled.

1493
02:30:44.52 --> 02:30:52.12
Fact. Back to the book, why is the will of the military commander deemed more decisive

1494
02:30:52.12 --> 02:30:57.24
of success than the will of leadership in any other calling? Clear lead is because the inertia,

1495
02:30:57.24 --> 02:31:03.48
frictions and confusions of the forces of the battlefield make all positive action more difficult.

1496
02:31:03.48 --> 02:31:12.76
And yet the principles which win intelligent man to man cooperation apply equally in all circumstances,

1497
02:31:12.76 --> 02:31:20.04
the same rules work on the battlefield as in an office. That's why we got to have something called

1498
02:31:20.04 --> 02:31:28.92
Ashalon front. The will does not operate in a vacuum. It cannot be imposed successfully if it

1499
02:31:28.92 --> 02:31:33.96
runs counter to reason. Things are not done in war primarily because a man wills it.

1500
02:31:35.40 --> 02:31:39.80
They are done because they are doable. Okay, this is a really important little section.

1501
02:31:41.24 --> 02:31:47.40
And, you know, I, you know, I talk about force of will. You're going to make something happen.

1502
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:53.000
Force of will. But there's a very important, I've called a caveat to that and we're about to

1503
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:59.24
get into this caveat. So to say that again, things not done in war, things are not done in war

1504
02:31:59.24 --> 02:32:05.16
primarily because a man wills it. They are done because they are doable. The limits for the

1505
02:32:05.16 --> 02:32:11.40
commander in battle are defined by the general circumstance. When he asks what he asks of his men

1506
02:32:11.40 --> 02:32:17.32
must be consistent with the possibilities of the situation? That might seem like common sense, right?

1507
02:32:17.32 --> 02:32:22.84
Hey, I can't ask you do anything that cannot be done. Yeah. Back to the book.

1508
02:32:22.84 --> 02:32:29.72
What can be successfully willed must first be clearly seen and understood. If a mid the confusion

1509
02:32:29.72 --> 02:32:34.44
of battle the commander sees what is required by the situation. If a mid the miscarriage of

1510
02:32:34.44 --> 02:32:39.64
arrangements and other assailing doubts of other men, he measures the means of doing it. And if he

1511
02:32:39.64 --> 02:32:45.16
then gives his order and holds his men to their duty, this is the ultimate triumph of the will on the

1512
02:32:45.16 --> 02:32:53.80
battlefield. To reflect on this thought is to know that he exercises his will far less upon his

1513
02:32:53.80 --> 02:33:04.12
men than upon himself. Should he on the other hand attempt to will that which his men know

1514
02:33:04.12 --> 02:33:11.000
cannot be done or feel unanimously as utterly beyond reason or should he base his order on

1515
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:18.52
assumptions which they recognize as false his will becomes temporarily without power and cannot

1516
02:33:18.52 --> 02:33:24.76
help the situation. This is one of those things where people think, I'm just going to tell him to

1517
02:33:24.76 --> 02:33:28.52
do it and we'll see what they can get done, right? Like no, they're not going to see that they can't

1518
02:33:28.52 --> 02:33:33.56
do it and they're just going to say we're not going to even try. Make your goals realistic. Make them

1519
02:33:33.56 --> 02:33:44.28
not just realistic. Make them achievable. There is scarcely any commander with any time in combat,

1520
02:33:45.24 --> 02:33:51.32
but has had his experience of having willing troops become suddenly unresponsive because his

1521
02:33:51.32 --> 02:33:57.40
facts were not straight. So sometimes the troops aren't going to do what you want to do. Even though

1522
02:33:57.40 --> 02:34:01.32
you have this strong will, they're not going to do. Why is that? Here we go. It happened to lieutenant

1523
02:34:01.32 --> 02:34:10.12
Colonel H.W. O. Knard during the night advance of first battalion, 501st parachute infantry

1524
02:34:10.12 --> 02:34:16.60
against the German held Dutch village in September 1944, the village of Shinjou,

1525
02:34:18.92 --> 02:34:25.16
which I have praised elsewhere in this book as one of the most brilliant battalion actions of the war.

1526
02:34:25.16 --> 02:34:34.36
The column had advanced only 500 yards beyond its outpost line when it came under machine gun and

1527
02:34:34.36 --> 02:34:39.80
anti-tank fire. Knard heard some of the fire clipping the branches of the tree above his head

1528
02:34:39.80 --> 02:34:46.28
and judged it was all going high. But the lead company had stopped and the men had jumped for the

1529
02:34:46.28 --> 02:34:51.72
ditches. He ran forward shouting to the men, keep going, keep going, that fire is high.

1530
02:34:51.72 --> 02:34:59.56
But his personal advance had no effect. Not a man stirred. So this is an incredibly

1531
02:35:01.08 --> 02:35:08.36
like seasoned, I mean, tough well-trained group and he's telling them, he's personally leading

1532
02:35:08.36 --> 02:35:13.40
him forward tanko. Go, go, we got to go. Don't worry that fire is high, but has no effect. Not a

1533
02:35:13.40 --> 02:35:19.08
man stirred back to the book. Within a moment, he understood why he had failed from one of the ditches

1534
02:35:19.08 --> 02:35:24.92
a rifleman answered him. If you think the fire is high, Colonel, come over here. We've had eight

1535
02:35:24.92 --> 02:35:33.40
men hit in the legs. So you've got to think about what is actually possible.

1536
02:35:35.32 --> 02:35:41.24
The supreme trial of the commander-in-war lies in his ability to overcome the weaknesses of human

1537
02:35:41.24 --> 02:35:48.04
nature in the face of danger and these are the matters which he cannot know in full unless he

1538
02:35:48.04 --> 02:35:59.24
is served with men where danger lies. Check. Chapter 12, men under fire.

1539
02:36:02.60 --> 02:36:06.76
To those that have known the firing line, it would scarcely be necessary to point out that

1540
02:36:06.76 --> 02:36:12.84
morale and combat is never a steady current force, but a rapidly oscillating wave whose variations

1541
02:36:12.84 --> 02:36:21.24
are both immeasurable and unpredictable. It is in this respect chiefly, the rapidity and capriciousness

1542
02:36:21.24 --> 02:36:28.92
of its variations that the morale problem in the zone of fire differs from that of a rear

1543
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:34.76
area soldiering. A band of men go through a terrible engagement, take its losses bravely,

1544
02:36:35.72 --> 02:36:39.88
and then become wholly demoralized in the hour in which it must bury its own dead.

1545
02:36:39.88 --> 02:36:47.88
A regiment, threaded to utter objection by a protracted stay in the lines may find its fighting

1546
02:36:47.88 --> 02:36:53.32
spirit again in a six hour a spite during which the men are deloused and giving a chain given

1547
02:36:53.32 --> 02:37:00.68
a change of underwear. A battalion advancing boldly may be brought in check because it's commander

1548
02:37:00.68 --> 02:37:06.12
did the disservice of going too far forward and getting himself killed within sight of the ranks.

1549
02:37:06.12 --> 02:37:13.48
A platoon may charge in capture and enemy hell, held ill, losing half its numbers and doing so,

1550
02:37:13.48 --> 02:37:19.88
then run down the hill again because one of its own artillery shells landed too close and hit one man.

1551
02:37:21.64 --> 02:37:29.24
So that the morale of the troops is constantly at risk of going up or going down.

1552
02:37:29.24 --> 02:37:36.52
The near presence of death and the prospect of meeting it at the next moment move men in

1553
02:37:36.52 --> 02:37:43.64
mere many curious and contrary ways, many men seem to change character under the guns.

1554
02:37:45.08 --> 02:37:51.24
The life of hardship and of danger gives new strength to the truly strong and greater weakness

1555
02:37:51.24 --> 02:37:57.96
to the truly weak. So combat is going to have an effect on people. It's going to amplify their

1556
02:37:57.96 --> 02:38:08.60
situation. What normal man would deny that some of the fullest and fairest days of his life

1557
02:38:08.60 --> 02:38:15.48
have been spent at the front or that the sky ever seems more blue or the air more bracing than

1558
02:38:15.48 --> 02:38:23.96
when there is just a hint of danger in the air. This is an important thing for leaders to understand

1559
02:38:23.96 --> 02:38:30.36
the man who cannot bring himself to trust the judgment and good faith of other men cannot command very long.

1560
02:38:31.48 --> 02:38:37.24
He will soon break under the unnecessary straining puts on himself, sleeplessness, nervous irritation

1561
02:38:37.24 --> 02:38:45.72
and loss of self control will be his... will be his lot until he is at last found totally unfit.

1562
02:38:46.28 --> 02:38:52.36
The ideal relationship between a commander and his subordinate is nowhere better illustrated than

1563
02:38:52.36 --> 02:38:59.40
an passage from the letter of instruction wherein Grant told Sherman to proceed to the destruction

1564
02:38:59.40 --> 02:39:06.04
of Johnson's army. Quote, I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign,

1565
02:39:06.84 --> 02:39:13.48
but simply to lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave you free to execute it

1566
02:39:13.48 --> 02:39:24.68
in your own way. Some decentralized command right there. This is another good one. When a company is

1567
02:39:24.68 --> 02:39:29.48
stopped by physical shock restoration of its movement becomes a problem for the battalion.

1568
02:39:29.48 --> 02:39:35.40
When a company is stopped by psychological shock, the continuing of the advance remains the problem

1569
02:39:35.40 --> 02:39:41.48
of the company commander. And here are some examples of that. Defusion of the company over

1570
02:39:41.48 --> 02:39:47.40
two-wide a sector, a retrograde movement by supporting weapons such as armor, the death of a well-loved

1571
02:39:47.40 --> 02:39:53.72
officer, light losses from friendly supporting fire. The appearance of some new and unexpected weapon

1572
02:39:53.72 --> 02:39:59.24
in the enemy sector such a few of the causes of psychological shock, the local treatments,

1573
02:39:59.24 --> 02:40:05.56
arous many and is varied as are the diseases. With respect to the effect of friendly fire hitting

1574
02:40:05.56 --> 02:40:10.60
among troops however, it is to be observed that if circumstances leave any room for doubt as to

1575
02:40:10.60 --> 02:40:15.64
the source the men will jump to the conclusion that they are being victimized by their own guns.

1576
02:40:18.36 --> 02:40:23.64
It is, in instances where it is unmistakable that they have been hurt by their own fire,

1577
02:40:23.64 --> 02:40:29.32
however, the commander is ill-advised to lie to them. They will usually learn the truth later on and

1578
02:40:29.32 --> 02:40:36.28
when they do it strikes a blow to his prestige. The experience combat soldier knows that such occasional

1579
02:40:36.28 --> 02:40:41.64
accidents are part of battle and he accepts them as such but he cannot make any good judgment to

1580
02:40:41.64 --> 02:40:48.92
the realization that his commander is either a fool or a liar. No gain ever comes from being

1581
02:40:48.92 --> 02:40:55.64
slick with troops, from acting divviously instead of forthrightly, from posing as having superior

1582
02:40:55.64 --> 02:41:00.84
knowledge or from being secretive or discounting the common sense of the majority. See a lot of

1583
02:41:00.84 --> 02:41:05.40
people do that. They discount the common sense. They think they're going to get away with that with

1584
02:41:05.40 --> 02:41:13.24
trying to bullshit the troops and it doesn't work. The most common cause of psychological shock

1585
02:41:13.24 --> 02:41:19.32
however is partial victory. The adage at the weakest point follows success as a fundamental

1586
02:41:19.32 --> 02:41:25.72
truth of minor tactics and the danger is always greatest when success is too easily won.

1587
02:41:25.72 --> 02:41:31.56
Success is disarming. Tension is the normal state of mind and body in combat when the tension

1588
02:41:31.56 --> 02:41:36.20
suddenly relaxes through the winning of a first objective. Troops are apt to be

1589
02:41:36.20 --> 02:41:44.36
pervaded by a sense of extreme well being and there is apt to ensue laxness in all its forms

1590
02:41:44.36 --> 02:41:54.60
and with all its dangers. He hammers this home. It might be well to speak of the importance of

1591
02:41:54.60 --> 02:42:00.04
enthusiasm, kindness, courtesy and justice which are the safeguards of honor and the tokens of

1592
02:42:00.04 --> 02:42:07.48
mutual respect. Respect between man and man. This last there must be if they are to go forward

1593
02:42:07.48 --> 02:42:12.68
together. Prosper and one another's company and find strength in the bonds of mutual

1594
02:42:12.68 --> 02:42:18.76
service and experience a common velocity in the relationship between the leader and the lead.

1595
02:42:19.32 --> 02:42:26.28
Loyalty is the big thing. The greatest battle asset of all but no man ever wins the loyalty of

1596
02:42:26.28 --> 02:42:37.48
troops by preaching loyalty. No man ever wins the loyalty of troops by preaching loyalty.

1597
02:42:38.76 --> 02:42:44.76
It is given him by them as he proves his possession of the other virtues.

1598
02:42:46.20 --> 02:42:51.72
The doctrine of a blind loyalty to leadership is a selfish and futile military dogma

1599
02:42:51.72 --> 02:42:58.84
except in so far as it is enobled by a higher loyalty in all ranks to truth and decency.

1600
02:43:01.08 --> 02:43:07.80
War is too, war is much too brutal a business to have room for brutal leading. In the end,

1601
02:43:07.80 --> 02:43:14.28
its only effect can be to corrode the character of men and when character has lost, all is lost.

1602
02:43:14.28 --> 02:43:22.68
The bully and the sadist serve only to further incomber in army. Their subordinates must

1603
02:43:22.68 --> 02:43:28.36
waste precious time clearing away the wreckage that they make. The good company has no place for

1604
02:43:28.36 --> 02:43:35.64
the officer who would rather be right than be loved for the time will quickly come when he walks

1605
02:43:35.64 --> 02:43:44.52
alone and in battle no man may succeed in solitude. That's worth repeating. The good company has

1606
02:43:44.52 --> 02:43:51.08
no place for the officer who would rather be right than be loved. We talked about that when Jordan

1607
02:43:51.08 --> 02:43:56.44
was on. You don't need to be right when you're dealing with your significant other. No. That's not

1608
02:43:56.44 --> 02:44:04.60
important. I have known a few brutal battle whose talents were so limited that they could not

1609
02:44:04.60 --> 02:44:09.80
try no other means of command than the abuse of men. But I have yet to see one who did a good

1610
02:44:09.80 --> 02:44:14.12
job of holding his command together when the going became rough and in the ranks fear of the

1611
02:44:14.12 --> 02:44:21.32
enemy began to eclipse fear of the man up top. Now he here comes the dichotomy.

1612
02:44:23.48 --> 02:44:27.64
Because he's talking about all these kindness and courtesy and justice and then he says

1613
02:44:27.64 --> 02:44:35.16
ruggedness, ruggedness, toughness, ah, these are quite different things. So long as they are only

1614
02:44:35.16 --> 02:44:41.40
the outer reflection of an inner determination and so long as the inner fire is tempered by a

1615
02:44:41.40 --> 02:44:48.36
heart having real compassion for men, these are the best hands for the business. They will win

1616
02:44:48.36 --> 02:44:53.80
the hearts of other men and will stimulate their valor. These others will try to be like them.

1617
02:44:53.80 --> 02:45:00.44
For as a truth not to be denied that the rugged way is the natural way in battle.

1618
02:45:01.72 --> 02:45:09.08
dichotomy right there. It tells this quick story. There comes to mind one last picture

1619
02:45:10.52 --> 02:45:17.48
from the same campaign. The scene is stone-walled fort Montbury, the last obstacle

1620
02:45:17.48 --> 02:45:26.76
barring entry into breast. A battalion of the 116th Infantry Regiment under major Tom Dallas

1621
02:45:26.76 --> 02:45:33.48
has had the fort invested for three days. But the defenders have withdrawn to within the inner

1622
02:45:33.48 --> 02:45:38.52
walls and will not surrender. The infantry fire cannot get at them. The ports have been

1623
02:45:38.52 --> 02:45:45.48
flamed but without visible effect. Finally Dallas acts for three tons of TNT to blow the walls.

1624
02:45:45.48 --> 02:45:52.52
He is given one ton, assisted by the infantry, the engineers lay the charge in a gallery

1625
02:45:52.52 --> 02:45:58.44
under the wall. The work completed Dallas is ready to give the orders.

1626
02:46:00.12 --> 02:46:06.60
Then he remembers, on the night before the battalion had attacked and Lieutenant Dürwood C.

1627
02:46:06.60 --> 02:46:12.20
settles had been killed in the moat. There had been no chance to recover the body.

1628
02:46:12.20 --> 02:46:16.84
It is still there and will be crushed by the falling masonry.

1629
02:46:18.84 --> 02:46:24.04
So the demolition is held up and Dallas asks for a volunteer to go down to the moat,

1630
02:46:24.04 --> 02:46:30.04
under fire and bring out the body. A young Lieutenant named Kelton responds.

1631
02:46:32.12 --> 02:46:37.56
In a few minutes, Kelton returns with his burden. He says to Dallas,

1632
02:46:37.56 --> 02:46:45.64
we are ready now. Dallas replies, ready? Then blow them all to hell.

1633
02:46:47.24 --> 02:46:52.20
The charge goes off the earth shakes. The walls collapse with a roar.

1634
02:46:53.96 --> 02:47:00.52
There is a stunned silence from within the fort. Dallas stands there for a few seconds

1635
02:47:00.52 --> 02:47:10.28
and the tears fall as he looks down at the body of his dead officer. That is loyalty.

1636
02:47:14.20 --> 02:47:20.60
It closes out with a couple more things. In every action larger small is decided by what happens

1637
02:47:20.60 --> 02:47:26.36
up there on the line with where men take the final chance of life or death.

1638
02:47:26.36 --> 02:47:33.000
Though I would not for a moment contend that modern war can be fought in one without vigorous thought

1639
02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.68
and action on the home front, I deny absolutely that these things can vouch safe military victory

1640
02:47:38.68 --> 02:47:47.000
anymore now than in the days when men fought with spears and crossbows. Any who look at war

1641
02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:53.32
and think otherwise are citing through the wrong end of the telescope. They have become deceived

1642
02:47:53.32 --> 02:47:58.84
by the vatness of the national preparation. How differently they would see things if it became

1643
02:47:58.84 --> 02:48:03.88
their duty to measure the thin margins between victory and defeat on the field itself.

1644
02:48:05.64 --> 02:48:10.92
The great victories of the United States have pivoted on the acts of courage and intelligence

1645
02:48:10.92 --> 02:48:17.40
of a very few individuals. The time always comes in battle when the decisions of statesmen

1646
02:48:17.40 --> 02:48:23.72
and of general generals can no longer affect the issue. And when it is not within the power of

1647
02:48:23.72 --> 02:48:31.08
our national wealth to change the balance decisively. Victory is never achieved prior to that point.

1648
02:48:31.08 --> 02:48:36.92
It can only be one after the battle has been delivered into the hands of men who move in

1649
02:48:36.92 --> 02:48:46.36
imminent danger of death. Courage is the real driving force in human affairs and that every

1650
02:48:46.36 --> 02:48:56.20
worthwhile action comes of some man daring what others fear to attempt. The man who is willing

1651
02:48:56.20 --> 02:49:05.000
to fight for his country is finally the full custodian of its security. If there were no willing

1652
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.20
men, no power and government could ever rally the masses of the unwilling.

1653
02:49:10.20 --> 02:49:18.84
To men who have been long and battle and have thought about it deeply, there comes at

1654
02:49:18.84 --> 02:49:27.24
last the awareness of this ultimate responsibility that one man must go ahead so that a nation

1655
02:49:27.24 --> 02:49:39.80
may live. And so the final and greatest reality that national strength lies only in the

1656
02:49:39.80 --> 02:49:49.48
hearts and spirits of men. The army, navy and air force are not the guardians of its national

1657
02:49:49.48 --> 02:49:56.52
security. The tremendous problem of the future is beyond their capacity to solve.

1658
02:49:58.84 --> 02:50:05.96
The search begins at the cradle where the mother makes the decision either to tie her child

1659
02:50:05.96 --> 02:50:16.60
to her apron strings or to rear him as a man. It continues through years of schooling when children

1660
02:50:16.60 --> 02:50:23.32
are taught either to place personal interests up or most or to think in terms of their responsibility

1661
02:50:23.32 --> 02:50:39.24
toward their society, their country and all of mankind. And there you go. Strength lies in the

1662
02:50:39.24 --> 02:50:52.68
hearts and spirits of men and freedom lies in the courage and the discipline of daring to attempt

1663
02:50:52.68 --> 02:51:06.52
what others fear. And I think that that reflects not just the strength and freedom of

1664
02:51:08.20 --> 02:51:21.32
nations of countries but also of individuals. We are ultimately responsible for ourselves

1665
02:51:21.32 --> 02:51:29.96
for our own freedom, for our own security. It is on us. And I think that is one of the

1666
02:51:33.24 --> 02:51:41.88
or the most valuable lessons to learn from SLA Marshall. And you know unwillingly he also taught

1667
02:51:41.88 --> 02:51:54.36
us a lesson about being truthful and honest which he was not and had he listened to some of his

1668
02:51:54.36 --> 02:52:00.44
own teachings. He might not have made that mistake to tarnish his reputation. It's not worth it.

1669
02:52:00.44 --> 02:52:12.76
He failed to listen to his own lesson. And maybe that's the last thing we learned is that we

1670
02:52:12.76 --> 02:52:24.28
just don't just don't talk the talk, just don't preach. But walk the walk and live the life

1671
02:52:24.28 --> 02:52:40.44
live correctly and follow the rules that you set for yourself. And then you go and you live

1672
02:52:40.44 --> 02:52:54.60
with the courage and the strength and the discipline. So that you can truly free your mind.

1673
02:52:57.72 --> 02:53:06.04
And I think that's all I've got for tonight, echo Charles. Yes. So speaking of

1674
02:53:06.04 --> 02:53:13.40
strength and discipline and walking the walk and walking the walk and living the life

1675
02:53:13.40 --> 02:53:22.44
staying on the path. Maybe you've got some things that could help us uphold the personal standards

1676
02:53:23.32 --> 02:53:30.84
that we set for ourselves. Yes. I can. I will. SLA Marshall.

1677
02:53:30.84 --> 02:53:36.36
Tautus a lesson he didn't want to teach us about that didn't he? Yeah, you know, there's one of those things where I was kind of

1678
02:53:36.36 --> 02:53:42.12
getting into it. You know like I'm like yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's and then like kind of like how you

1679
02:53:42.12 --> 02:53:47.16
meant you can from like wait, but this guy but then you know it's like it's the it's the that got to me. Yeah,

1680
02:53:47.16 --> 02:53:53.80
it's the that got to me. It's an unfortunate that got to me. Yeah, see that's man. If this guy, if this guy,

1681
02:53:53.80 --> 02:53:57.64
if we just knew about his normal military record and you never said he didn't have enough stuff,

1682
02:53:57.64 --> 02:54:05.64
this would have so much more impact. Yeah. The fact that he lied just just it just hurts it.

1683
02:54:05.64 --> 02:54:11.64
It's all there's to it jammed him up as as echo trolls would say. But you know, if you can

1684
02:54:12.04 --> 02:54:19.88
how as it were not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Yeah. Yeah. There's some of those

1685
02:54:19.88 --> 02:54:23.40
stuff in there. Yeah. I'll tell you what is possible. This for us to stand the path.

1686
02:54:23.40 --> 02:54:32.20
Yeah. And in that path on that path is jujitsu. Of course. Right. Better be for shibi. Should be in my

1687
02:54:32.20 --> 02:54:37.64
entire team. You actually said today that that was one quarter of your life. It is in your life.

1688
02:54:37.64 --> 02:54:43.48
One quarter of the things you do is jujitsu. You know of the total things that I do. Yeah.

1689
02:54:44.44 --> 02:54:48.84
Important things because there's things that aren't on that list like no one will grow street store. Well,

1690
02:54:48.84 --> 02:54:53.24
going in the grocery store does facilitate one of the other things in my life. See what I'm saying?

1691
02:54:54.36 --> 02:54:58.04
Does not one of the things. It is not one of the things. No. That's like saying,

1692
02:54:58.04 --> 02:55:01.80
okay, breathing. You know, well, bro, it breathing is not a part of your life. Well, yeah, but it

1693
02:55:01.80 --> 02:55:09.000
facilitates other things. Okay. So if that's the case does origin facilitate jujitsu. Yes,

1694
02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:14.44
it does. Big time. Which is good, right? Yes. So I eat food and you gotta have origin. Yes. Check.

1695
02:55:14.44 --> 02:55:21.000
Big time. And okay. So origin. Okay. Origin main.com. This is where you can get your geat for jujitsu.

1696
02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.44
If you haven't got one already, go get one. There's people out there who don't know any other geeks

1697
02:55:26.44 --> 02:55:33.24
at for origin geat. Actually, some contact to me was like, hey, I realize, you know, origin is the

1698
02:55:33.24 --> 02:55:39.80
geat, but before I buy one, would you consider donating one to my cause? I think they're like saving

1699
02:55:39.80 --> 02:55:44.36
up from, you know, cause sometimes that's how, you know, you save up for your geat, whatever. So I'm thinking

1700
02:55:44.36 --> 02:55:50.12
on one hand, the dichotomy. Sure. I'm never using these other geeks again. I wouldn't. Oh, I see.

1701
02:55:50.12 --> 02:55:57.000
But on the other hand, why would I want to bestow a substandard geat on to someone just starting by the way?

1702
02:55:57.72 --> 02:56:02.28
So it's like boom, they got that. But then again, no, I'll get, I probably will. I'll see.

1703
02:56:02.28 --> 02:56:05.48
I mean, that's the size, you know. All right. Well, that's me. They're here nor there. And

1704
02:56:05.48 --> 02:56:10.44
nonetheless, the point is if you want to get good geat, all made it America, various types of

1705
02:56:10.44 --> 02:56:16.68
ships. I had when we were in Maine. So after the campus over at the factory, we were just

1706
02:56:16.68 --> 02:56:23.72
getting stuff done and planning and everything. But he went into depth on weaving the fabric on the

1707
02:56:23.72 --> 02:56:33.000
loom and everything. Bro. It's crazy. I've got full understanding, though. Yeah. And it's also.

1708
02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:38.44
Yeah. It's awesome to see. It's interesting to watch Pete get into it. Just let him go. Yeah.

1709
02:56:38.44 --> 02:56:45.08
Oh, yeah. For sure. Oh, man. That's why these things are like so dope when you look at him. That's why

1710
02:56:45.08 --> 02:56:52.04
that's why that's why the company is where it is. Yes. Because without that passion for him for the

1711
02:56:52.04 --> 02:56:57.08
team, like when you talk to anyone on the team in origin, they're like whining of this stuff to be

1712
02:56:57.08 --> 02:57:03.56
awesome. Yeah. And so that's why it's that way. Yeah. Yeah. So it's cool. If you ever get a chance to

1713
02:57:03.56 --> 02:57:08.12
go to the factory up there, it's worth checking out. Yeah. Because it isn't just like, oh, a factory.

1714
02:57:08.12 --> 02:57:11.80
It's like a factory. You can hang out there. It's kind of like a, would you, it's a

1715
02:57:11.80 --> 02:57:16.60
project like a pro shot. Yeah. You can kind of go in there and then it's like kind of open.

1716
02:57:16.60 --> 02:57:22.04
You can talk to the people. It's good, man. That's good. Yeah. So yeah. Oh, yeah. I would recommend that to

1717
02:57:22.04 --> 02:57:31.000
in farming to main, by the way. So it is anyway, also on there is joggers and rash guards and

1718
02:57:32.36 --> 02:57:40.04
clothes. Yeah. For sure. For sure. The rash guards compression compression gear. Yeah. That's

1719
02:57:40.04 --> 02:57:45.80
for your supplements as well. So you got for supplements joint warfare, which is going to help

1720
02:57:45.80 --> 02:57:52.76
your joints for a bunch of different reasons. I get awesome compliments about that that I'm

1721
02:57:52.76 --> 02:57:58.28
stoked on. That kriloil also going to help your joints and it's going to help you just whole life.

1722
02:57:59.80 --> 02:58:03.72
And then you got the discipline, which I'm on a lot of discipline right now. And I didn't even realize

1723
02:58:03.72 --> 02:58:09.64
we were at a three hour podcast at this moment in time and we recorded a couple other podcasts today.

1724
02:58:09.64 --> 02:58:13.64
Yeah. The shorter podcasts, but podcasts, nonetheless. You over here getting the upper hand on

1725
02:58:13.64 --> 02:58:18.36
life. Yeah. That's what's going on. Plus I did the three scripts of discipline. Yeah. I'm doing

1726
02:58:18.36 --> 02:58:26.92
I have to feel like I understand it. So just one free life, pre-mission, pre-function. Yeah, pre-function.

1727
02:58:26.92 --> 02:58:35.80
Pre-get some. Pre-get some. Yeah. You're going to get some in any format, mental format, physical format,

1728
02:58:35.80 --> 02:58:47.72
that my middle daughter took the ACTs on Saturday and she came home. She I kind of fueled her up on

1729
02:58:47.72 --> 02:58:53.80
some discipline before going in and she came back fired up. She was like, yeah, no, I felt so

1730
02:58:53.80 --> 02:58:58.92
I was getting off. And I was like, yeah, you're just, you're just a discipline. Yeah, so it's one of the

1731
02:58:58.92 --> 02:59:06.68
many schools I ever. And you know, she's not as big as me. No. I still gave her an opportunity to do this.

1732
02:59:06.68 --> 02:59:11.16
I'm down for the three schools of discipline. By the way, yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's kind of a double effect

1733
02:59:11.16 --> 02:59:15.96
and I could see how that could be. Especially if you go into some situation like a test. Or even like a

1734
02:59:15.96 --> 02:59:20.92
jujitsu situation, whatever. Just get it. Just do it. Yeah. And then even afterwards, when you remember

1735
02:59:20.92 --> 02:59:25.80
how like solid you were, you're like, you kind of get you fired up. Yeah. It's true. It's like a double layered

1736
02:59:25.80 --> 02:59:32.20
thing. You got fired up because you got fired up. You like that, though, too. Yes, I do very much. And

1737
02:59:32.20 --> 02:59:36.76
oh, yeah, and the last thing is, and it's not the last, but certainly not the least is something called

1738
02:59:36.76 --> 02:59:42.76
mok. If you want to know what mok is, it's real simple. Mok is mok is mok. It's really nice. Yeah,

1739
02:59:42.76 --> 02:59:48.52
if you want some additional protein. Right. I mean, mok pancakes straight out. How did you do it? Okay.

1740
02:59:48.52 --> 02:59:53.000
Okay. So now you're going down this rabbit hole. It's making mok everything. Okay. Here's the

1741
02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:57.48
thing. I'm sketch about the pancakes. Right. So first of all, I don't even like, I straight up

1742
02:59:57.48 --> 03:00:03.80
don't even like pancakes at all. That's interesting. For me to even think about making mok pancakes,

1743
03:00:03.80 --> 03:00:07.24
maybe it's something I could try because maybe I would like it. Well, if you don't like it,

1744
03:00:07.24 --> 03:00:12.52
here's the thing. I'm not a mok pancake like expert at all. Okay. So I tell people how to make it.

1745
03:00:12.52 --> 03:00:17.56
Well, here's the thing is how I made them. Okay. So I get tests with the way where they good.

1746
03:00:17.56 --> 03:00:21.16
Because they weren't good. Let's not talk about it. Oh, they're real good. Yeah. So

1747
03:00:21.16 --> 03:00:26.12
did you put maple syrup on it? I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did.

1748
03:00:26.12 --> 03:00:31.000
Maple syrup come from origin. Main. Okay. That's okay. Well, then again, no, I can't say that. I don't

1749
03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:36.36
think so. Not that I know it, but I don't read the bottle or nothing. Okay. Good. Oh, well,

1750
03:00:36.36 --> 03:00:41.64
okay, on Saturdays or Sundays, depending I get I make pancakes. It says only one day. And then it's

1751
03:00:41.64 --> 03:00:45.24
for the kids and all this stuff. So it's a thing. Oh, that's cool. Hey, you know what I'm going to do for

1752
03:00:45.24 --> 03:00:49.000
you kids this weekend? I'm going to give you a bunch of carbohydrates and poison you. Yeah. Well,

1753
03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:55.88
in my defense maple syrup. I got these or my wife got these paleo, but it's paleo pancake mix. Okay.

1754
03:00:55.88 --> 03:01:02.20
Yeah. Check. Was that almond powder or something? Ah, I don't know. Okay. Paleo pancake mix. Check.

1755
03:01:02.20 --> 03:01:06.92
So boom, I go in and you know pancake mix is like a certain kind of mix to create like a

1756
03:01:06.92 --> 03:01:11.56
pancake. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know why it is. But then I'm like, wait,

1757
03:01:11.56 --> 03:01:18.28
I need to create pancake. I can make pancake mix. I could easily jam this whole thing up easily.

1758
03:01:18.28 --> 03:01:21.64
And I'm not being able to just for me as an experiment. My kids are still on the way.

1759
03:01:21.64 --> 03:01:26.36
She seems like, yeah, they're about to make it. But I give them more pancakes. They are not correct.

1760
03:01:26.36 --> 03:01:31.16
I will hear about it. And the whole thing is a flop. Yeah. I guess technically I just make regular

1761
03:01:31.16 --> 03:01:34.92
pancakes later. But it wasn't about that right then. There I was trying to deliver big time. So I

1762
03:01:34.92 --> 03:01:40.04
can't just start throwing random ingredients and I'll recipe in the back of it. So this is what I did.

1763
03:01:40.04 --> 03:01:46.60
It called for a cup and a third of pancake mix. I just put like a little less than a cup

1764
03:01:46.60 --> 03:01:54.04
and then a third, a little bit over a third cup milk. Milk in there. A little bit of water.

1765
03:01:54.04 --> 03:01:58.92
Some MCT oil. I put in. It calls for like you put butter and I did put butter. Like a

1766
03:01:58.92 --> 03:02:06.44
grass-bed butter by the way. And there was an eggs. Yeah. Yeah. So you put an egg. Boom. Mix it all up.

1767
03:02:08.52 --> 03:02:12.84
Pancakes. Oh, I put chocolate chips in the form of a happy face too. We did it all from time to time.

1768
03:02:12.84 --> 03:02:21.40
And yeah. So we did that. Yeah. I'm more like a sad face at your house. But boom. I make them

1769
03:02:21.40 --> 03:02:25.96
a little bit darker. Obviously because it was the chocolate peanut butter by the way. What's in the

1770
03:02:25.96 --> 03:02:33.40
minute? Yeah. Well, yeah. There is darker brown. Yeah. Not the mint too. By the way, I think that

1771
03:02:33.40 --> 03:02:37.88
you're risking jamming up pancakes for the mint. I think I don't know. I didn't do it. Anyway,

1772
03:02:37.88 --> 03:02:43.40
yeah. Came a good boom. Maybe we'll syrup. Boom. Big hit. Kids like they kids didn't know. But

1773
03:02:43.40 --> 03:02:48.60
they had the peanut butter kind of flavor in there. Yeah. Yeah. So that's the milk. It normally

1774
03:02:48.60 --> 03:02:54.04
goes with milk. Or you can put it on water. But that's like a ham sandwich. Whereas if you put milk

1775
03:02:54.04 --> 03:02:57.88
in there, it's like a delicious. You know what? It did do I put a two drops of vanilla in there?

1776
03:02:57.88 --> 03:03:04.20
Oh. Andy. Andy Burke came home from camp. And we were just talking about camp. And

1777
03:03:04.20 --> 03:03:08.20
this cool. He's like out with the awesome meeting to everyone and training in bubble

1778
03:03:08.20 --> 03:03:12.36
ball. And he's like, you know what I really like though? And I was like, oh, why? He's my first

1779
03:03:12.36 --> 03:03:17.56
time having more. Yeah. He's all. He's like, he's like, he's like, this is surprisingly good. Like,

1780
03:03:17.56 --> 03:03:22.36
like, Brad, we already knew that. And I was like, ah, you, you do you think people don't

1781
03:03:22.36 --> 03:03:27.48
believe it? Is your instinct to think, oh, this is some kind of a supplement. It's going to taste

1782
03:03:27.48 --> 03:03:32.52
bad. And it's have to deal with it. But this one may be tastes okay. And therefore, you know,

1783
03:03:32.52 --> 03:03:39.48
these guys are talking up. But the reality is the reality is it's good. Like a dessert. Straight up.

1784
03:03:39.48 --> 03:03:45.56
Yep. It's like a milkshake. Yep. That's the milk. And has is good for you. That's the crazy thing.

1785
03:03:45.56 --> 03:03:51.24
All right. So cool. That you can do all that stuff in origin, main dot com. Yes. And also

1786
03:03:51.24 --> 03:03:58.04
jocquistorts called jocquistore. And this is where you can get shirts, hoodies, rash, other rash

1787
03:03:58.04 --> 03:04:04.84
guards, more skewed towards the bad, the message. Well, call it the message. Anyway, there's some

1788
03:04:04.84 --> 03:04:09.48
cool stuff on there. If you want to represent discipline equals freedom, because discipline does

1789
03:04:09.48 --> 03:04:14.60
equal freedom, by the way. That's one of those things like you can think about that for like 20

1790
03:04:14.60 --> 03:04:20.76
days. And it'll it'll make more and more sense over the 20, 20 days. And then after two years. And in

1791
03:04:20.76 --> 03:04:25.96
my case three years makes even more sense. You see it everywhere. Just the fingers were busy. Yeah.

1792
03:04:25.96 --> 03:04:31.56
And so it does. And if you want to represent jocquistore.com, that's where you can get the stuff.

1793
03:04:31.56 --> 03:04:35.08
Cool stuff on there. So new stuff on there too, by the way. Really? Yes. I.e.

1794
03:04:36.44 --> 03:04:40.12
Because you're making stuff. I don't even know about decentralized command style. Well, we got a

1795
03:04:40.12 --> 03:04:46.52
few novelty items. You know, what I'm using is that. I'm assuming if I have it correctly, it's just

1796
03:04:46.52 --> 03:04:52.60
something that's pretty cool. You know, got to go in there and find out any novelty items. Sure. You

1797
03:04:52.60 --> 03:04:55.80
think people are going to read you think people on the path throughout spending their harder and money on

1798
03:04:55.80 --> 03:05:01.96
novelty items. Is that what's going on? Uh, well, there's always layers. So it's not just novelty.

1799
03:05:01.96 --> 03:05:08.76
It's still you're still representing big time. 100%. But some one of the layers is just quite novel.

1800
03:05:08.76 --> 03:05:12.84
In my opinion. Anyway, go there. Jocquistore.com. Why is it so long? You're talking about it.

1801
03:05:12.84 --> 03:05:16.76
Yeah, we're throwing that's why you got to know. It's going to check and check. Jocquistore.com.

1802
03:05:16.76 --> 03:05:20.52
Yeah. Anyway, hats on there as well. A lot of just cool stuff. Anyway,

1803
03:05:20.52 --> 03:05:27.32
Jocquistore.com. Good way to support. Good way to stand the path. It's just good all around. Good.

1804
03:05:27.96 --> 03:05:35.40
David, did you see the, uh, what's the name? Um, not what's the name. But the, you know, the Nike commercial,

1805
03:05:35.80 --> 03:05:41.000
right, you know, the Nike commercial has been in the news, right? The commercial, whatever. And

1806
03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:47.08
Theo Vaughan was like, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1807
03:05:47.08 --> 03:05:51.12
yeah, yeah, yeah. The opposite of it. The opposite of it. That was a thing. Yeah, you know what that is. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe not

1808
03:05:51.12 --> 03:05:55.56
obviously. You know, when you look at it, it's like, yeah, hey, yeah, they did the same thing. But it, that way.

1809
03:05:55.56 --> 03:06:02.16
I know where they got it from, you're not okay. Whatever. Um, but they did do the same thing. But here's what?

1810
03:06:02.16 --> 03:06:07.16
Yeah, here's what I have really got from that whole thing. Especially his video. How he did it. He was like, watch it. You know what I did?

1811
03:06:07.16 --> 03:06:10.64
It really illustrated that that concept like how we talk about all the time where

1812
03:06:10.64 --> 03:06:16.24
When someone says good like that, it really stands out now.

1813
03:06:16.24 --> 03:06:17.44
Like you see that everywhere.

1814
03:06:17.44 --> 03:06:21.04
Even if you see the word good written on the sign or something,

1815
03:06:21.04 --> 03:06:22.64
you're like, this is too jocous it.

1816
03:06:22.64 --> 03:06:23.24
You know what I'm saying?

1817
03:06:23.24 --> 03:06:25.24
So it sticks out in your mind just way more.

1818
03:06:25.24 --> 03:06:27.64
And again, whether that happened or not,

1819
03:06:27.64 --> 03:06:30.24
it's a weird word to pick.

1820
03:06:30.24 --> 03:06:30.84
Yeah.

1821
03:06:30.84 --> 03:06:34.84
That's a weird word to pick for the ad for the Nike ad.

1822
03:06:34.84 --> 03:06:37.64
It's a little bit of weird word to pick.

1823
03:06:37.64 --> 03:06:41.24
It's a little bit, it's not a normal word to pick.

1824
03:06:41.24 --> 03:06:44.64
In my opinion, it's a good word to pick.

1825
03:06:44.64 --> 03:06:48.64
But anyways.

1826
03:06:48.64 --> 03:06:51.64
Nonetheless, good, that's all good, man.

1827
03:06:51.64 --> 03:06:52.64
You're the man.

1828
03:06:52.64 --> 03:06:55.64
Also, good way to support the seal.

1829
03:06:55.64 --> 03:06:57.64
Do you still want to kind of hand my back though, didn't you?

1830
03:06:57.64 --> 03:06:58.64
Oh, big time.

1831
03:06:58.64 --> 03:06:59.64
Oh, yeah, what's up.

1832
03:06:59.64 --> 03:07:00.64
Yeah.

1833
03:07:00.64 --> 03:07:02.64
And it makes sense too.

1834
03:07:02.64 --> 03:07:05.64
Yeah, just the whole, I mean, you know.

1835
03:07:05.64 --> 03:07:08.64
But yeah, I think that when you hear that, you, I always hear,

1836
03:07:08.64 --> 03:07:10.64
oh, joc, I just hear you saying it, you know.

1837
03:07:10.64 --> 03:07:14.64
Even if I see the word good in all caps in a regular sentence.

1838
03:07:14.64 --> 03:07:17.64
Like in a different context, I'll be like,

1839
03:07:17.64 --> 03:07:18.64
You know, remind me of it.

1840
03:07:18.64 --> 03:07:20.64
It just sticks out like that.

1841
03:07:20.64 --> 03:07:21.64
I don't know.

1842
03:07:21.64 --> 03:07:26.64
Anyway, good way to support also is to subscribe on iTunes and

1843
03:07:26.64 --> 03:07:29.64
Stitcher, if you're Android, Google play and you know,

1844
03:07:29.64 --> 03:07:32.64
wherever you where we listen to your podcast, just subscribe.

1845
03:07:32.64 --> 03:07:34.64
And don't forget that there is.

1846
03:07:34.64 --> 03:07:38.64
The warrior kid podcasts, you have which we recorded a couple more.

1847
03:07:38.64 --> 03:07:40.64
Today, so we've got some fresh ones out there.

1848
03:07:40.64 --> 03:07:44.64
I apologize for to everyone for taking so long to get those out.

1849
03:07:44.64 --> 03:07:46.64
Life got the upper hand a little bit.

1850
03:07:46.64 --> 03:07:49.64
We back, but that's like, yeah,

1851
03:07:49.64 --> 03:07:53.64
I had to get default aggressive this weekend and just crush some of those.

1852
03:07:53.64 --> 03:07:57.64
Yeah, so warrior kid podcasts for your kids and for, well,

1853
03:07:57.64 --> 03:07:59.64
really uncle J.K. has less than for everybody.

1854
03:07:59.64 --> 03:08:03.64
Also, warrior kid, there's a warrior kid at Irish Oaks Ranch.

1855
03:08:03.64 --> 03:08:07.64
Com, Aiden, he's up there working hard and he's making,

1856
03:08:07.64 --> 03:08:09.64
he's got a business.

1857
03:08:09.64 --> 03:08:11.64
He's making soap, jocco soap.

1858
03:08:11.64 --> 03:08:12.64
Good soap.

1859
03:08:12.64 --> 03:08:12.64
Yeah.

1860
03:08:12.64 --> 03:08:13.64
Good soap.

1861
03:08:13.64 --> 03:08:13.64
Good soap.

1862
03:08:13.64 --> 03:08:13.64
Yeah.

1863
03:08:13.64 --> 03:08:13.64
Good soap.

1864
03:08:13.64 --> 03:08:13.64
Yeah.

1865
03:08:13.64 --> 03:08:15.64
And you can get that there.

1866
03:08:15.64 --> 03:08:16.64
Help help yourself.

1867
03:08:16.64 --> 03:08:20.64
And you help yourself by staying clean.

1868
03:08:20.64 --> 03:08:22.64
That's the idea.

1869
03:08:22.64 --> 03:08:23.64
Stay clean.

1870
03:08:23.64 --> 03:08:24.64
Yeah.

1871
03:08:24.64 --> 03:08:26.64
The YouTube channel.

1872
03:08:26.64 --> 03:08:28.64
If you want to see echoes legit video,

1873
03:08:28.64 --> 03:08:32.64
Did you post the video that you just made for kids?

1874
03:08:32.64 --> 03:08:33.64
The revenge.

1875
03:08:33.64 --> 03:08:35.64
I call the revenge video.

1876
03:08:35.64 --> 03:08:36.64
You call it the frigid.

1877
03:08:36.64 --> 03:08:37.64
Yeah.

1878
03:08:37.64 --> 03:08:38.64
That's interesting.

1879
03:08:38.64 --> 03:08:39.64
Yeah, that is interesting.

1880
03:08:39.64 --> 03:08:40.64
There's some of these things there.

1881
03:08:40.64 --> 03:08:42.64
I have not posted that yet, but yes, yes.

1882
03:08:42.64 --> 03:08:43.64
That's the YouTube video.

1883
03:08:43.64 --> 03:08:47.64
YouTube channel, which is called Jocco podcast.

1884
03:08:47.64 --> 03:08:48.64
It's a YouTube channel.

1885
03:08:48.64 --> 03:08:51.64
You can watch all the YouTube videos on there.

1886
03:08:51.64 --> 03:08:57.64
And then you can leave crazy comments from someone now and then a thing about all kinds of crazy stuff, which is fun.

1887
03:08:57.64 --> 03:08:58.64
Sure.

1888
03:08:58.64 --> 03:08:59.64
Whatever you like.

1889
03:08:59.64 --> 03:09:01.64
Also, back back to working out.

1890
03:09:01.64 --> 03:09:04.64
I got re-onit.com on it.

1891
03:09:04.64 --> 03:09:05.64
The company on it.

1892
03:09:05.64 --> 03:09:06.64
Don't.

1893
03:09:06.64 --> 03:09:09.64
I got rings until you recently hear something about rings.

1894
03:09:09.64 --> 03:09:13.64
Again, I said before, you're always preaching about the rings.

1895
03:09:13.64 --> 03:09:14.64
Right.

1896
03:09:14.64 --> 03:09:15.64
So, one of the what do you call it?

1897
03:09:15.64 --> 03:09:16.64
The staples.

1898
03:09:16.64 --> 03:09:21.64
It's actually, in many ways, considered to me to be the first thing you could get.

1899
03:09:21.64 --> 03:09:26.64
If you had one thing you could get, you could get rings and you could do really well with them.

1900
03:09:26.64 --> 03:09:27.64
Yeah.

1901
03:09:27.64 --> 03:09:31.64
Now, reaping the benefits of the rings.

1902
03:09:31.64 --> 03:09:33.64
They're like, they're actually pretty dope.

1903
03:09:33.64 --> 03:09:35.64
Yeah, we got to get wood rings.

1904
03:09:35.64 --> 03:09:39.64
I was telling everyone, get wood rings, not plastic rings, not metal rings, get wood rings because they absorb the sweat.

1905
03:09:39.64 --> 03:09:40.64
They dig.

1906
03:09:40.64 --> 03:09:41.64
Yeah.

1907
03:09:41.64 --> 03:09:42.64
Anything else is slippery.

1908
03:09:42.64 --> 03:09:43.64
They'll get debris.

1909
03:09:43.64 --> 03:09:44.64
Yeah.

1910
03:09:44.64 --> 03:09:46.64
And my kids are, you know, and they're adjustable.

1911
03:09:46.64 --> 03:09:48.64
I've only had on it rings.

1912
03:09:48.64 --> 03:09:49.64
They're cool.

1913
03:09:49.64 --> 03:09:50.64
They're adjustable by number.

1914
03:09:50.64 --> 03:09:51.64
And it's all the stuff.

1915
03:09:51.64 --> 03:09:54.64
So my kids, two years old and five years old.

1916
03:09:54.64 --> 03:09:58.64
They're swinging on them.

1917
03:09:58.64 --> 03:10:00.64
They get real creative with them anyway.

1918
03:10:00.64 --> 03:10:02.64
It's not yet one night.

1919
03:10:02.64 --> 03:10:04.64
But I'll do that.

1920
03:10:04.64 --> 03:10:06.64
It's all these little functional things anyway.

1921
03:10:06.64 --> 03:10:08.64
There's a lot to be gained with the rings.

1922
03:10:08.64 --> 03:10:10.64
I'm a gram of the lever of the rings now.

1923
03:10:10.64 --> 03:10:14.64
And now I would agree with you 100 percent that that should be kind of the first thing I think.

1924
03:10:14.64 --> 03:10:15.64
You can say a part of it.

1925
03:10:15.64 --> 03:10:16.64
But you might as well get rings.

1926
03:10:16.64 --> 03:10:21.64
You can do folks and you can do dips and you can do pushups and you can do muscle ups and you can do like weird.

1927
03:10:21.64 --> 03:10:24.64
It's kind of squatting, planking.

1928
03:10:24.64 --> 03:10:25.64
Oh, yeah.

1929
03:10:25.64 --> 03:10:26.64
Yeah.

1930
03:10:26.64 --> 03:10:27.64
App stuff.

1931
03:10:27.64 --> 03:10:28.64
I can't do it by the way.

1932
03:10:28.64 --> 03:10:30.64
Just in case anyone gets the idea that I can do it.

1933
03:10:30.64 --> 03:10:32.64
I'm here to tell you I cannot even come close.

1934
03:10:32.64 --> 03:10:33.64
Yeah, that would be pretty impressive.

1935
03:10:33.64 --> 03:10:35.64
Because I just impressive even if a little gang.

1936
03:10:35.64 --> 03:10:36.64
Yeah.

1937
03:10:36.64 --> 03:10:37.64
Yeah.

1938
03:10:37.64 --> 03:10:39.64
But here's the thing about rings and pull ups specifically.

1939
03:10:39.64 --> 03:10:41.64
This is why it's better than a pull up bar.

1940
03:10:41.64 --> 03:10:43.64
Because pull ups pull up bars coins.

1941
03:10:43.64 --> 03:10:44.64
Good.

1942
03:10:44.64 --> 03:10:45.64
Really good.

1943
03:10:45.64 --> 03:10:47.64
I've had a pull up bar for a long time.

1944
03:10:47.64 --> 03:10:49.64
But the rings is like, yeah, you can adjust for pull ups.

1945
03:10:49.64 --> 03:10:52.64
And then you can adjust them down so you can do kind of like a rose.

1946
03:10:52.64 --> 03:10:54.64
It's a way that you get their pull adjustable.

1947
03:10:54.64 --> 03:10:55.64
You can do a piece of bra.

1948
03:10:55.64 --> 03:10:56.64
It's a bra.

1949
03:10:56.64 --> 03:10:57.64
That's the overall day.

1950
03:10:57.64 --> 03:10:58.64
That's the overall.

1951
03:10:58.64 --> 03:11:02.64
It extended my workout literally by like 30%.

1952
03:11:02.64 --> 03:11:03.64
Dang.

1953
03:11:03.64 --> 03:11:04.64
30.

1954
03:11:04.64 --> 03:11:05.64
Yeah.

1955
03:11:05.64 --> 03:11:06.64
Yeah.

1956
03:11:06.64 --> 03:11:07.64
Because there's other like I use them every single time.

1957
03:11:07.64 --> 03:11:08.64
Yeah.

1958
03:11:08.64 --> 03:11:09.64
You do your next exercise majorly.

1959
03:11:09.64 --> 03:11:10.64
Anyway, you know what?

1960
03:11:10.64 --> 03:11:11.64
Those are rings.

1961
03:11:11.64 --> 03:11:14.64
This is a lot of other cool stuff on on it.com.

1962
03:11:14.64 --> 03:11:15.64
So yeah, man.

1963
03:11:15.64 --> 03:11:16.64
Brows around.

1964
03:11:16.64 --> 03:11:17.64
See what up?

1965
03:11:17.64 --> 03:11:18.64
Get something.

1966
03:11:18.64 --> 03:11:20.64
Psychological warfare album.

1967
03:11:20.64 --> 03:11:21.64
We're working on the next one.

1968
03:11:21.64 --> 03:11:23.64
I'm thinking that the next one is not going to come out.

1969
03:11:23.64 --> 03:11:26.64
It's going to come out right around Christmas is my guess.

1970
03:11:26.64 --> 03:11:26.64
Yeah.

1971
03:11:26.64 --> 03:11:29.64
So if you have anything, somebody wants one about shopping.

1972
03:11:29.64 --> 03:11:30.64
Compulsive.

1973
03:11:30.64 --> 03:11:31.64
How do I shop?

1974
03:11:31.64 --> 03:11:32.64
Stop.

1975
03:11:32.64 --> 03:11:33.64
Compulsive shopping.

1976
03:11:33.64 --> 03:11:34.64
Yeah.

1977
03:11:34.64 --> 03:11:35.64
I don't know if I can tackle that one.

1978
03:11:35.64 --> 03:11:36.64
You know why?

1979
03:11:36.64 --> 03:11:37.64
I have no compulsion to shop.

1980
03:11:37.64 --> 03:11:38.64
I don't even like shop.

1981
03:11:38.64 --> 03:11:39.64
I don't even like go to the store.

1982
03:11:39.64 --> 03:11:40.64
You don't know.

1983
03:11:40.64 --> 03:11:41.64
I don't buy anything.

1984
03:11:41.64 --> 03:11:42.64
What the demons of shopping.

1985
03:11:42.64 --> 03:11:43.64
Yeah.

1986
03:11:43.64 --> 03:11:44.64
I've seen.

1987
03:11:44.64 --> 03:11:45.64
No.

1988
03:11:45.64 --> 03:11:47.64
I will say I've seen it because you see people that buy things that they can't really afford.

1989
03:11:47.64 --> 03:11:48.64
Yeah.

1990
03:11:48.64 --> 03:11:51.64
So I guess maybe we could talk about it because yeah.

1991
03:11:51.64 --> 03:11:52.64
No.

1992
03:11:52.64 --> 03:11:54.64
Actually now that I think about it, I can talk about that.

1993
03:11:54.64 --> 03:11:56.64
We can put together a little something.

1994
03:11:56.64 --> 03:11:57.64
Psychological warfare.

1995
03:11:57.64 --> 03:12:02.64
If you got little moments of weakness you want to overcome, I can talk to you personally about

1996
03:12:02.64 --> 03:12:04.64
that through your iPhones.

1997
03:12:04.64 --> 03:12:06.64
Google Play iTunes.

1998
03:12:06.64 --> 03:12:07.64
This is an MP3.

1999
03:12:07.64 --> 03:12:08.64
Through your Android.

2000
03:12:08.64 --> 03:12:09.64
I don't want to leave you all out.

2001
03:12:09.64 --> 03:12:10.64
Through your Samsung.

2002
03:12:10.64 --> 03:12:11.64
Right?

2003
03:12:11.64 --> 03:12:12.64
Sure.

2004
03:12:12.64 --> 03:12:14.64
Equal Opportunity Platform.

2005
03:12:14.64 --> 03:12:15.64
Device.

2006
03:12:15.64 --> 03:12:16.64
Devices.

2007
03:12:16.64 --> 03:12:17.64
In every scenario.

2008
03:12:17.64 --> 03:12:18.64
Let's say.

2009
03:12:18.64 --> 03:12:19.64
Yeah.

2010
03:12:19.64 --> 03:12:22.64
And also you can get that chocolate white day.

2011
03:12:22.64 --> 03:12:23.64
I'm on that train too.

2012
03:12:23.64 --> 03:12:27.64
There's a lot of trains in the chocolate situation.

2013
03:12:27.64 --> 03:12:29.64
It's supplementation situation.

2014
03:12:29.64 --> 03:12:31.64
It's been hot.

2015
03:12:31.64 --> 03:12:32.64
Yeah.

2016
03:12:32.64 --> 03:12:36.64
And while when it was hot up in Maine at the camp, how good did that tea taste?

2017
03:12:36.64 --> 03:12:37.64
Legend.

2018
03:12:37.64 --> 03:12:38.64
Because it had it.

2019
03:12:38.64 --> 03:12:39.64
It was really good.

2020
03:12:39.64 --> 03:12:40.64
It was really good.

2021
03:12:40.64 --> 03:12:41.64
It was really good.

2022
03:12:41.64 --> 03:12:42.64
It was really good.

2023
03:12:42.64 --> 03:12:43.64
It was crazy.

2024
03:12:43.64 --> 03:12:44.64
So yeah.

2025
03:12:44.64 --> 03:12:46.64
She was always super scary.

2026
03:12:46.64 --> 03:12:47.64
She was very cool.

2027
03:12:47.64 --> 03:12:48.64
Afterdish became dr świat.

2028
03:12:48.64 --> 03:12:49.64
Right?

2029
03:12:49.64 --> 03:12:52.64
Because he could pack it up, or at least he had it begun.

2030
03:12:52.64 --> 03:12:53.64
I wanted to know.

2031
03:12:53.64 --> 03:12:54.64
Okay.

2032
03:12:54.64 --> 03:12:55.64
But even though it broke down,

2033
03:12:55.64 --> 03:12:56.64
when it struck new light.

2034
03:12:56.64 --> 03:12:59.64
It dropped into half of the lights,

2035
03:12:59.64 --> 03:13:01.64
the light absorbed the light on the back of the mic.

2036
03:13:01.64 --> 03:13:02.64
Yeah.

2037
03:13:02.64 --> 03:13:04.64
Apply beeps and light on top of the light.

2038
03:13:04.64 --> 03:13:05.64
You're low-grade.

2039
03:13:05.64 --> 03:13:07.64
At all that was the light for the lights.

2040
03:13:07.64 --> 03:13:05.64
It's not a nice watch around you.

2041
03:13:06.64 --> 03:13:10.64
And don't worry, your difference is over.

2042
03:13:10.64 --> 03:13:11.64
For a for a for a chance to see.

2043
03:13:11.64 --> 03:13:12.64
As it seems to work.

2044
03:13:12.64 --> 03:13:13.64
I didn't really expect it.

2045
03:13:13.64 --> 03:13:14.48
I'll come for it.

2046
03:13:14.48 --> 03:13:15.30
I'll install it.

2047
03:13:15.30 --> 03:13:17.62
Okay, so then I also got some books.

2048
03:13:17.62 --> 03:13:21.02
We got the way into Warrior Kid and Mark's mission.

2049
03:13:21.02 --> 03:13:22.86
This is for kids.

2050
03:13:22.86 --> 03:13:25.82
Between the ages of four and 84.

2051
03:13:25.82 --> 03:13:28.32
Because everybody can get something.

2052
03:13:28.32 --> 03:13:35.32
Yeah, you got life's five year old fired up about getting the job.

2053
03:13:35.32 --> 03:13:36.32
By the way.

2054
03:13:36.32 --> 03:13:37.32
No.

2055
03:13:37.32 --> 03:13:39.76
Yeah, in the second book, Mark, who's the young character,

2056
03:13:39.76 --> 03:13:42.76
and the book wants to get, wants to get a new bike.

2057
03:13:42.76 --> 03:13:44.44
But he needs money in order to get money.

2058
03:13:44.44 --> 03:13:45.44
Guess what you need.

2059
03:13:45.44 --> 03:13:46.44
You need a job, son.

2060
03:13:46.44 --> 03:13:48.90
You need a job, or sell some stuff.

2061
03:13:48.90 --> 03:13:49.90
Or sell some stuff.

2062
03:13:49.90 --> 03:13:50.90
All right, job and sell.

2063
03:13:50.90 --> 03:13:52.10
Or that's what he has to do.

2064
03:13:52.10 --> 03:13:55.34
So yeah, if you want to give your kids a good book,

2065
03:13:55.34 --> 03:13:59.10
that will teach them about discipline, hard work.

2066
03:13:59.10 --> 03:14:01.28
Being kind.

2067
03:14:01.28 --> 03:14:02.28
Yeah.

2068
03:14:02.28 --> 03:14:05.72
But the dichotomy of being strong.

2069
03:14:05.72 --> 03:14:06.72
It's all in there.

2070
03:14:06.72 --> 03:14:07.72
Yeah, man.

2071
03:14:07.72 --> 03:14:08.72
And it's all in there.

2072
03:14:08.72 --> 03:14:09.72
You're late.

2073
03:14:09.72 --> 03:14:11.76
You explain it while you Uncle Jake.

2074
03:14:11.76 --> 03:14:16.24
Whoever one of you guys, it's good how you explain it

2075
03:14:16.24 --> 03:14:17.60
in real simple terms.

2076
03:14:17.60 --> 03:14:20.32
And then you get this kid Mark, especially in the sub talk

2077
03:14:20.32 --> 03:14:21.000
about the second one.

2078
03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.20
Right now where he's like, he kind of,

2079
03:14:23.20 --> 03:14:24.88
he overcomes them stuff.

2080
03:14:24.88 --> 03:14:26.28
He's super strong right now.

2081
03:14:26.28 --> 03:14:27.28
But still a lot to learn.

2082
03:14:27.28 --> 03:14:28.48
So he understands it.

2083
03:14:28.48 --> 03:14:30.68
And then at first he's questioning it.

2084
03:14:30.68 --> 03:14:32.28
Then he starts to understand.

2085
03:14:32.28 --> 03:14:32.88
Any questions?

2086
03:14:32.88 --> 03:14:33.76
Then he understands.

2087
03:14:33.76 --> 03:14:35.28
Then he's fired up about doing it.

2088
03:14:35.28 --> 03:14:37.08
I mean, because he gets, but it's really good.

2089
03:14:37.08 --> 03:14:39.52
And that's literally how like the kid, whoever you're reading

2090
03:14:39.52 --> 03:14:41.24
in my case, really read into my daughter.

2091
03:14:41.24 --> 03:14:42.24
She's fired up.

2092
03:14:42.24 --> 03:14:45.24
And I watch her getting just as fired up as Mark.

2093
03:14:45.24 --> 03:14:46.24
He's like, oh, my gosh.

2094
03:14:46.24 --> 03:14:47.24
She's like, oh my gosh.

2095
03:14:47.24 --> 03:14:48.24
Yeah.

2096
03:14:48.24 --> 03:14:49.24
No, she gets fired up.

2097
03:14:49.24 --> 03:14:50.24
Pretty good, man.

2098
03:14:50.24 --> 03:14:53.24
Really, it's interesting to see the little transition.

2099
03:14:53.24 --> 03:14:55.24
Yeah, I forget so much good feedback.

2100
03:14:55.24 --> 03:14:58.24
Anyways, that's that way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.

2101
03:14:58.24 --> 03:15:03.24
Also the Dispunnyckels Freedom Field Manual, which is solid,

2102
03:15:03.24 --> 03:15:04.24
which is solid.

2103
03:15:04.24 --> 03:15:07.24
It's a good daily reminder.

2104
03:15:07.24 --> 03:15:10.24
It's not, you don't need to read that whole book every day.

2105
03:15:10.24 --> 03:15:11.24
You can read one.

2106
03:15:11.24 --> 03:15:14.76
You can read three pages and you can get yourself, you know, you might have been

2107
03:15:14.76 --> 03:15:17.24
very often path of like, get yourself right back on the path.

2108
03:15:17.24 --> 03:15:18.24
Yeah.

2109
03:15:18.24 --> 03:15:19.24
It's a good thing to read.

2110
03:15:19.24 --> 03:15:21.24
You could like read that, but read it.

2111
03:15:21.24 --> 03:15:23.24
A page two pages three pages every day.

2112
03:15:23.24 --> 03:15:26.24
It will, would you, I would say this.

2113
03:15:26.24 --> 03:15:29.24
It will absolutely help you if you read three pages a day.

2114
03:15:29.24 --> 03:15:30.24
Yeah.

2115
03:15:30.24 --> 03:15:31.24
That's a bold statement too.

2116
03:15:31.24 --> 03:15:33.24
I'm saying this book, a book.

2117
03:15:33.24 --> 03:15:36.24
This is not, this is not an exercise program.

2118
03:15:36.24 --> 03:15:38.24
This is an supplement that you take.

2119
03:15:38.24 --> 03:15:40.24
This is not, this is not a treatment that you get.

2120
03:15:40.24 --> 03:15:42.24
This is a book pages in a book.

2121
03:15:42.24 --> 03:15:44.24
If you read them, it's going to help you.

2122
03:15:44.24 --> 03:15:45.24
Yeah.

2123
03:15:45.24 --> 03:15:46.24
That's, that's what my statement is.

2124
03:15:46.24 --> 03:15:47.24
And I believe it's, be true.

2125
03:15:47.24 --> 03:15:48.24
Why?

2126
03:15:48.24 --> 03:15:49.24
Because I read it.

2127
03:15:49.24 --> 03:15:50.24
I wrote the damn thing.

2128
03:15:50.24 --> 03:15:51.24
And I still read it.

2129
03:15:51.24 --> 03:15:52.24
And it's helping.

2130
03:15:52.24 --> 03:15:57.24
And then we got extreme ownership, which is combat leadership, a run with my brother,

2131
03:15:57.24 --> 03:15:58.24
Lave Babin.

2132
03:15:58.24 --> 03:16:03.24
And how to take the principles that we learned in combat and use them in your business and

2133
03:16:03.24 --> 03:16:04.24
life.

2134
03:16:04.24 --> 03:16:06.24
And the follow on book to that.

2135
03:16:06.24 --> 03:16:10.24
The dichotomy of leadership, which I mentioned the word dichotomy quite a bit, Dean

2136
03:16:10.24 --> 03:16:12.24
Lister says it's my favorite word.

2137
03:16:12.24 --> 03:16:15.24
I'm not so sure it's my favorite word.

2138
03:16:15.24 --> 03:16:21.24
I think my favorite word is discipline, but I don't know if I have a favorite word.

2139
03:16:21.24 --> 03:16:26.24
Anyways, I do talk about the dichotomy a lot because the dichotomy is present in everything

2140
03:16:26.24 --> 03:16:27.24
that we do.

2141
03:16:27.24 --> 03:16:32.24
So if you want to get this book, it comes out September 25th.

2142
03:16:32.24 --> 03:16:34.24
If you want to get the first edition, you should order it.

2143
03:16:34.24 --> 03:16:39.24
You'll be the yesterday or right now because, well, you don't want to miss out on the first

2144
03:16:39.24 --> 03:16:40.24
edition.

2145
03:16:40.24 --> 03:16:41.24
I got my first copies.

2146
03:16:41.24 --> 03:16:42.24
I'm all doing right there.

2147
03:16:42.24 --> 03:16:43.24
There it is.

2148
03:16:43.24 --> 03:16:45.24
So dichotomy of leadership.

2149
03:16:45.24 --> 03:16:47.24
Order it now.

2150
03:16:47.24 --> 03:16:51.24
September 25th, it'll come to your door.

2151
03:16:51.24 --> 03:16:55.24
Speaking of leadership, we got a leadership consulting company called

2152
03:16:55.24 --> 03:16:56.24
Eshelon Front.

2153
03:16:56.24 --> 03:16:59.24
And we solve problems through leadership.

2154
03:16:59.24 --> 03:17:00.24
It's me.

2155
03:17:00.24 --> 03:17:01.24
It's Lave.

2156
03:17:01.24 --> 03:17:04.24
It's JP to know Dave Burke Flynn, Cochrane.

2157
03:17:04.24 --> 03:17:06.24
We also got Mike Surrellian, board.

2158
03:17:06.24 --> 03:17:09.24
We got a couple new members joining the team right now.

2159
03:17:09.24 --> 03:17:14.24
If you want us to come to your company, go to Eshelonfront.com.

2160
03:17:14.24 --> 03:17:16.24
That's what we do.

2161
03:17:16.24 --> 03:17:19.24
Also the master in San Francisco, California.

2162
03:17:19.24 --> 03:17:21.24
Getting close to sold out.

2163
03:17:21.24 --> 03:17:23.24
We probably have a little bit left right now.

2164
03:17:23.24 --> 03:17:26.24
Maybe by the time this podcast comes out, it might be sold out.

2165
03:17:26.24 --> 03:17:29.24
If you want to come to the master, leadership event San Francisco, California,

2166
03:17:29.24 --> 03:17:34.24
October 17th and 18th, all the other ones have sold out.

2167
03:17:34.24 --> 03:17:36.24
This one is going to sell out to.

2168
03:17:36.24 --> 03:17:39.24
If you want to come, don't wait to the last minute.

2169
03:17:39.24 --> 03:17:43.24
Don't wait until I post on social media that the master sold out and then call up and say,

2170
03:17:43.24 --> 03:17:45.24
can we please fit one more people because we can't?

2171
03:17:45.24 --> 03:17:47.24
If we could, we wouldn't say it was sold out.

2172
03:17:47.24 --> 03:17:52.24
So just register now for the master.

2173
03:17:52.24 --> 03:17:57.24

We got the roll call September 21st.

2176
03:18:02.24 --> 03:18:04.24
We just opened up a few more seats.

2177
03:18:04.24 --> 03:18:06.24
I think we opened up 50 more seats.

2178
03:18:06.24 --> 03:18:08.24
We don't that twice now, but it's going to be, I don't know,

2179
03:18:08.24 --> 03:18:11.24
for being able to do it again because registration is going to be closing soon.

2180
03:18:11.24 --> 03:18:15.24
That is also registered at extremownership.com.

firefighters, paramedics, other first responders.

2198
03:19:38.24 --> 03:19:43.24
Here at home, thanks for being vigilant and protecting us and our family.

2199
03:19:43.24 --> 03:19:49.24
And to everyone else out there, keep learning, keep striving,

03:19:49.24 --> 03:19:52.24
keep trying to figure out where you can get better and be better,

2201
03:19:52.24 --> 03:19:55.24
and it is an easy.

2202
03:19:55.24 --> 03:20:01.24
And it takes courage and it takes strength and it takes discipline day after day

2203
03:20:01.24 --> 03:20:10.24
after day to get up and face the unforgiving world and get after it.

2204

So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
