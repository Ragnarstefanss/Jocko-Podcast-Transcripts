So it's like it's one of those things where you get man, if you want to dessert, like monk is the dessert and it's super as far as like, you know, like sometimes you're like, I need a dessert, but I, you know, I'm on the pass. And like that attitude and and I said, you know, what how did you, what was it that made he goes everything like the way he's carried himself, the way he looked, the way he had his head, he had his hair, he's like he had his head shaved and he just looked like this guy's just freaking square away from day one. You know, hey, going back into when we were forming up, you know, one of the first things we did is, you know, what grabbed in our go-lock, you know, our, our enlisted formation, he's 79. You know, didn't hit our building, the front of us there, wasn't too bad there or small, but it was a good, it was a good shake out for us, like a little confidence builder, like a couple bad guys, no one got injured. Like, you know, we went through training training was good, but it was nowhere near the level that, you know, we provided our guys once we got over to trade it. So, you know, guys going there and start clearing out Mosul, you know, at some point, you know, one of our seal units rotated out in J and his formation rotated in which is awesome. And you're like, and man, you guys might want to tighten this shit up over here, you know, but it was good, you know, damn who's there? Like he's going to be like, well, you know, Hack will made himself out to be a little bit more than he was or Hack talked to good game, but that really wasn't the guy he was air. Like, when I started, bro, when I started with the podcast, we know what all my friends started like, calling me like, dude, that podcast was sick. So I think we did that good, but just going back to land war for, I think, you know, the stress levels, they were high during a life-iron training, the field training exercises we did were just badass were building, you know, little wood huts all over the dam place on those ranges. And I remember picking up my reading like damn, this is really good because the way you guys translated into the business role was just, you know, it made sense, you know. And I think the guys, you know, I mean, shit, we had a thermal camera out there at one point and we're video tape in the guys coming in so they come back and go through their debrief, we're going, this is what you all look like. He said, hey Steve, we've got a protect emission, we've got to protect our credibility, credibility, it's built, know the people's blood, it was built, know the people's blood, we've got to protect that at all cost. And so there was, there was a lot to that, you know, the most stressful thing for me during land warfare was doing all the live fire training because there was definitely a lot of opportunity for someone to get injured or wounded, you know, you know what I mean. You know, and just going back to work on real quick, one of the things I realized when you're up there, you know, when you're down in the troops, you're just like, give me my gear. And hell even if you're getting one mission, you're like, all right, we're good to go, you know, because you think we all think we're going to be out of there with then six, seven months. And, you know, it bothers me so much when I hear people talk about, you know, these, the US military, you know, causing all these civilian casualties, man, we go through such great lengths to prevent civilian casualties and put our soldiers, sailors, airmen of a marine at such risk to prevent those casualties to civilian casualties from happen happening. I didn't know if they were playing games with me or what, but I went over the wall and I was like, shit, I don't know if I'm going to make it. And then just going back on decentralized command, you know, the other CQC or close court combat sheet, we had, you know, our guys were going up to this house. I was looking forward to, you know, and you know, the guy I really do with their BJs is a good dude smart and I think he set up a good foundation with what he had. So we were out, we went out there, you know, we're going with some other intel people out there and they're like, hey, we're going after some of this sensitive stuff here And when you see those good leaders coming through and look, the good leader could be anyone in the platoon from an E5 to the platoon or the task unit commander, anyone in between, you have one good leader or two good leaders in there and they're going to do a good job. I'm like, I thought I was good, you know, but I didn't know if they were playing. Like when you got your ass kicked, you got your ass kicked and it would sometimes, you know, that was another big difference when a leader, when the leadership in the task unit or in the platoon would say, would come back and say, hey, we screwed up. Or, you know, like, for me, I was like, I can do this, which is a really arrogant thing to think, right? But so you're going to make because because one thing I don't like and Lafayne, I have talked about this on the podcast is the someone thinking, well, you know, I'm in charge, so I'm going to be hated and that's okay. But it was just, you know, shitty day for us, you know, obviously the whole task you know, was hit, was hit hard on that. You know, there's, you know, our guys, our sniper's killed a few guys on that one, and the shoot was good. and you were like, oh, you got the firecracker right off the bat or something like that, like that was the nickname. You know, like, I don't know what we turned over with you guys. And the, you know, the entry teams going through, you know, our breaches going through laying the charge on the door. And so, you know, started, you know, I got a good six, six month of getting saturated with group level stuff. And from that point, it was like, all right, you know, we knew we were getting into, but then it's like, now it's real. I'm like, I got my first time work going, but he's dialed in and he had a great reputation, you know. Like when you got to talk about you, so to say you're going to write a book, you're going to start a podcast or you're going to put a spotlight on yourself. You know, we're still getting the occasional ID, you know, ID at him, you know, an army, silver affairs. And so as we're doing that, you know, we get a call over the radio, you know, that, you know, our other unit from Corrigator was hit. Yeah, you just took good outstanding, good leader, just good, like good dude, man. And one of the things people talk about is, hey, you know, when it's time to go and man, I was in that position and we had some high profile cases out there and they just wear on your man, you know, they just wear on you. I was I was you know sitting in in the back of the meeting with socom, you know, over and over again and here in the world being put out and seeing the handwritten notes from the secretary of defense, you know what I'm saying? So, you know, so after, you know, after those handful of ops, we had, uh, you know, we had no rubber 19. Well, that's what I always tell people, hey, man, the people who utilize the laws of combat did good cover and move kept things simple, good communications across board, prioritizing executed, stayed detached from what was going on in the guys that utilize decentralized command, whether they'll allow fire team leaders and squad leaders to make decisions at their level. What you're just asked, you know, I've seen Elliot a handful of times over the years, you know, it buds graduations and stuff like that. You know, he's like, it's because if you're thinking you're going to go there, you're going to get what you ask for. I like, and I hate to say that because right, right, that's like, that's like, what? You know, we had a, I don't know if you know, opposed you, but it could go more and more on serving. They're like, hey, you guys are going to come in behind these guys and we're going to replace them. So the seems to be like, hey, man, you, the guy that was going to come doesn't look like a company. So, you know, you're like, hey, you guys are going around race track. The headquarters element was good because it was the first time I'm outside of that that that sealed team, you know, whether it's training or just seal, you know, mission. You know, and then as I started going in college, like, man, I just, I don't want to learn. I know when you guys came in, you guys did, I don't know, four times, four, five times. But like I was like, okay, here's what we're going to, here's what we're going to do for communications during the insert. You know, I think a hack worth, I think of like you said a dude showing up right here, cut, right uniform, just everything he's communicating lines up with his actions. Oh, you know what I'll say one more thing at one point, probably you were like six months out from retiring and you said I have three courses of action for what I'm going to do You know, like, I don't know what to expect. And then I'd be like, hey, you know, like giving a single leg. And everyone, like, that's when I was super stoked, you know, because you feel horrible, uh, and you feel like you're shining a spotlight on yourself. And that's a good precursor because when you go to combat, if you end up going on deployment and you end up getting in real combat, you're going to see that, that's the only place that's going to come out even more is when you go into combat, people start acting crazy. Like there's no, there's, it's like saying, hey, I'm going to go freaking, uh, uh, uh, start a podcast. You know, in some of the books you covered early on, like the last hundred yards, and I was like damn. Like when I filled pool comp, I was like, all right, damn, I'm not going to make it through this man. So it was, it was, it was a good deployment, you know, and it probably the things that weighed the most on that deployment is I'd never really been a part of a ramp ceremony to where you're like, you're leaving this thing. You know, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of good work being done. He's like Roger that, you know, he's like, fire out. And to be able to debrief like that, it's, you know, he's like, thank you. It's lessons about hey, when this happens when you lose a guy, when you get a guy badly wounded, when you get somebody that's, you know, acting a certain way, when someone's losing combat, like all those lessons, being able to learn them is freaking so powerful. And one of the things that always comes to mind with me is in 2003, you know, we had Posi out there or Vietnam guy, good dude, man, just good family guy, Vietnam had more stores and you can imagine. And actually, you know, you got a family eight person family that are getting blown apart by Frag grenades because the woman was trying to defend her house from looters, which again, may sound like a crazy story. And I was talking to their ops officer and he was like, hey, you know what, this is a, this is a good shot, bad result, meaning that the, our soldier was following the proper rules of engagement. You know, you're going to be a prep school, you know, and then boom, you go to a ship. And therefore, if they make a mistake, which everyone's going to make mistakes, when they make a mistake, when they make a mistake, which they will, people go, oh, you know, like, guess what? Get on the wall and I was like, damn seriously, like I'm going through trying to think of what I did wrong. Let's everybody know like, hey, I don't put up, I'm not going to put up with this.
