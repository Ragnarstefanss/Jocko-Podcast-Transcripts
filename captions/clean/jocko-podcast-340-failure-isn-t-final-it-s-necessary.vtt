1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocopont Cas number 340 with Carrie Helden and me, Jocco Willing. Good evening, Carrie. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.36 --> 00:00:11.36
That's when the explosion rocks me.

3
00:00:12.24 --> 00:00:15.76
It's so big that at first I thought our vehicle had been hit.

4
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:23.72
My vision goes completely white and there's a ringing in my ears, a gentle wine as my brain re-ignites and starts working again.

5
00:00:24.52 --> 00:00:26.52
Sort of.

6
00:00:26.52 --> 00:00:30.20
It is the same feeling I had in the old days when Chuck Ladell used to hit me.

7
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:34.44
Sure, I'm conscious, but I'm not quite right.

8
00:00:35.16 --> 00:00:37.64
My brain doesn't feel like it's processing at full speed.

9
00:00:37.64 --> 00:00:40.28
My vision slowly returns and white flecks of light,

10
00:00:40.28 --> 00:00:43.72
frolic through my eyes as my situation comes back to me in a jolt.

11
00:00:43.72 --> 00:00:48.60
I realize we're okay, but immediately know we're totally fucked.

12
00:00:49.96 --> 00:00:52.60
The vehicle in front of me hit my roof.

13
00:00:52.60 --> 00:01:07.000
I don't know if it hit a pressure plate or what, but a two and a half ton armored vehicle just did a back flip 20 meters in the air is completely shredded and missing everything from the front wheel forward and is now sitting on top of my vehicle.

14
00:01:09.16 --> 00:01:14.52
Bullets from machine gun, nest, high above us, start to hit the ground around us.

15
00:01:15.80 --> 00:01:21.56
I can hear rounds pinging off our vehicle. The RPG, nest comes seconds later.

16
00:01:21.56 --> 00:01:26.60
But luckily the asshole shooting them at me suck and they fly over our vehicle.

17
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:35.24
I can now see that the firing positions have been built up. These aren't hastily made. These fuckers planned on killing us right here.

18
00:01:35.72 --> 00:01:37.72
I need to move.

19
00:01:37.72 --> 00:01:43.48
The whole fight is right here in the front. The guys in the back are so far away that all they can do is listen to the gunfire.

20
00:01:43.48 --> 00:01:50.92
The pass is so narrow that you can barely fit two vehicles in the gap while they are able to hit us from every conceivable position in angle.

21
00:01:52.28 --> 00:01:53.88
There is no way to reinforce us.

22
00:01:55.48 --> 00:02:05.64
Wisely, like the grizzled combat veteran he is, the ODA sergeant major starts pushing all the units to the high ground to take the fight to them and get the guys out of the line of fire.

23
00:02:07.64 --> 00:02:11.64
That is great and all, but it doesn't do jack shit for me.

24
00:02:11.64 --> 00:02:19.64
The lead three vehicles, one completely blown up, are stranded with nowhere to go while death reigns down around us.

25
00:02:21.96 --> 00:02:26.84
I fucking know them about to die. I'm not going to see my wife again.

26
00:02:27.56 --> 00:02:29.40
I'm not going to see my kids again.

27
00:02:31.32 --> 00:02:33.000
I don't want it to end like this.

28
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:48.36
That right there is an excerpt from a book called Scars and Stripes, which is written by Greenbrae,

29
00:02:49.08 --> 00:02:55.32
Special Forces sniper UFC fighter and all around incredible human, Tim Kennedy.

30
00:02:56.12 --> 00:02:59.000
It's an honor to have Tim with us here again.

31
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.84
I think about five years after the first time, maybe even almost six times.

32
00:03:03.72 --> 00:03:07.96
Six years after the first time we did this first one, it's episode 21.

33
00:03:08.36 --> 00:03:13.08
He's here to talk about his book, his lessons learned and his experiences.

34
00:03:13.08 --> 00:03:14.84
Tim, welcome back man.

35
00:03:14.84 --> 00:03:15.64
That's up man.

36
00:03:16.20 --> 00:03:17.80
Thanks for coming by my pleasure.

37
00:03:18.84 --> 00:03:20.04
Lot of stuff going on.

38
00:03:20.68 --> 00:03:22.04
Yeah, I was a heavy book to write.

39
00:03:22.04 --> 00:03:25.24
I was a heavy book to read. It was hard.

40
00:03:25.80 --> 00:03:27.48
Did it help you?

41
00:03:27.48 --> 00:03:35.80
Um, there are a lot of surprising things and I think I'm a pretty smart fella.

42
00:03:36.44 --> 00:03:37.96
I think I have a pretty good memory.

43
00:03:37.96 --> 00:03:39.72
I've been blown up and punched a bunch of times.

44
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:47.24
Going back and cooperating first, I testimony, you know, first I witnessed to what happened

45
00:03:47.24 --> 00:03:48.28
in some of these situations.

46
00:03:49.48 --> 00:03:54.12
It was really hard to cooperate. There'd be six shooters, three different people died.

47
00:03:54.12 --> 00:03:59.08
And all six of us were arguing over who shot who, you know, like one guy's like,

48
00:03:59.08 --> 00:04:00.92
I shot that guy. I'm like, no, no, you didn't shoot that.

49
00:04:00.92 --> 00:04:01.88
You're right next to me.

50
00:04:01.88 --> 00:04:06.28
And if you're engaging this dude over there, you know, and it was so wild.

51
00:04:07.16 --> 00:04:10.28
You know, going back to even an 18 year old firefighter EMT

52
00:04:11.32 --> 00:04:12.84
in San Luis, Pittsburgh, California,

53
00:04:13.72 --> 00:04:15.08
just south of a taskadero,

54
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.04
a vehicle roll over.

55
00:04:18.68 --> 00:04:22.92
I live pretty much my whole entire adult life thinking that this little girl that I worked on died.

56
00:04:22.92 --> 00:04:25.40
And writing this book, I found out that she actually lived.

57
00:04:26.12 --> 00:04:27.64
So there's some really great things like that.

58
00:04:27.80 --> 00:04:32.52
But then there were also moments where, you know, like when my best friend died when I was 15,

59
00:04:33.24 --> 00:04:37.64
I've intentionally not thought about that for 20 years.

60
00:04:38.20 --> 00:04:43.24
And having to ride it, having to remember what it felt like.

61
00:04:43.24 --> 00:04:44.52
You know, that was really hard.

62
00:04:45.72 --> 00:04:46.76
So I don't know if it helped.

63
00:04:47.80 --> 00:04:49.48
It definitely provided clarity.

64
00:04:49.48 --> 00:04:52.20
And I'll always take clarity and truth over anything else.

65
00:04:53.72 --> 00:05:00.12
Yeah, I mean, I always think it's helpful to talk about right about it, talk about it.

66
00:05:00.12 --> 00:05:02.52
Because like he said, when you ride it, when you ride something down,

67
00:05:02.52 --> 00:05:07.08
eat like even from a historical perspective of like writing it down and checking with your teammates and

68
00:05:07.08 --> 00:05:09.08
be like, hey, how do you remember this?

69
00:05:09.32 --> 00:05:11.72
So you get the facts a little bit more straightened out.

70
00:05:12.36 --> 00:05:16.20
And then just the understanding of what you went through and the understanding of the lessons learned

71
00:05:16.20 --> 00:05:21.96
when you write it down, it like clarifies it for you. Yeah, you know. So I, in reading the book,

72
00:05:21.96 --> 00:05:25.32
man, first of all, let me say this out of the gate. It's a freaking outstanding book.

73
00:05:26.12 --> 00:05:30.28
And I'm going to read some of it today. But if you haven't already gotten this book, then

74
00:05:30.84 --> 00:05:37.16
order it immediately. Because it's an awesome read and it's a wild ride.

75
00:05:38.36 --> 00:05:44.12
This is like, you know, and people say, oh, if you, if you made this into a movie script or whatever,

76
00:05:44.12 --> 00:05:48.84
people wouldn't believe it, it's kind of like that. You know what I mean? It's, it's that,

77
00:05:49.72 --> 00:05:54.76
it's that freaking, your life has been that wild. Yeah, it has been that wild. You know, but

78
00:05:54.76 --> 00:06:02.52
even though it's been extraordinary stories and the, the, the, the resounding theme I've heard from

79
00:06:02.52 --> 00:06:08.20
everyone is how relatable moments of that was. You know, like, I remember smelling, you know, like,

80
00:06:08.20 --> 00:06:13.08
the, the, the smell of the valleys and Afghanistan, how you talked about the dirt, like I grew up on a

81
00:06:13.08 --> 00:06:18.20
farm in Fresno. And that's exactly what it's meant like, you know? And, you know, you know,

82
00:06:18.20 --> 00:06:21.56
guys that fought and people that do do do do do do do do do do do do. You know, like, remember and walking

83
00:06:21.56 --> 00:06:26.44
into mats and, and like the early 2000s and it smelled like pukes, it smelled like piz, you know,

84
00:06:26.44 --> 00:06:30.84
the ammonia, like, the, as our bodies would be eating themselves because we're training so hard

85
00:06:30.84 --> 00:06:35.64
that we're just smell that, the off gas of our body, like eating its own muscle, the same smell

86
00:06:35.64 --> 00:06:39.72
that you get from like dudes and buds and the same smell that you get from guys and, like, SF selection,

87
00:06:39.72 --> 00:06:46.60
like during kind of peak MMA, those gyms smelled like that. Oh, yeah, where you can't eventually,

88
00:06:46.60 --> 00:06:49.80
you have to throw your clothes away. Yeah. Because they wreak and nothing gets rid of them.

89
00:06:49.80 --> 00:06:53.72
No, you can't. Then you can't put them in the sun, you can't believe you're that smell is just like

90
00:06:53.72 --> 00:07:03.32
part of it now. And so like, it's been wild, but it's, it's cool to have people get context into some,

91
00:07:03.32 --> 00:07:10.36
some of the reasons why I am the way that I am. And I think more important now in 2022 is,

92
00:07:11.96 --> 00:07:16.92
the book is mostly failure. You know, like the book is mostly struggles. The book is mostly,

93
00:07:16.92 --> 00:07:20.52
it is not like this crescendo moment of me doing this great thing. It's like,

94
00:07:20.52 --> 00:07:25.32
here's what croch, rock feels like. You know, here's what trench foot feels like.

95
00:07:25.88 --> 00:07:31.56
Here's what it looks like to, what go into a fight and lose. It's not, you know,

96
00:07:31.56 --> 00:07:36.84
world champion tim Kennedy. It's like not. Well, you know, jocca regates his hand raised,

97
00:07:36.84 --> 00:07:41.08
Luke Rock hold gets their hand raised. And I stand there not as world champion.

98
00:07:41.88 --> 00:07:45.88
Those moments are the moments that I really, really focus on. Because I think those are the moments that

99
00:07:45.88 --> 00:07:51.56
shape us. Yeah, yeah, those are, I mean, I don't know you that well, but I've known you for

100
00:07:51.56 --> 00:07:55.40
a long time. And I've, you know, obviously when you were fighting, I was always watching you and

101
00:07:55.40 --> 00:08:00.36
stoked that you were doing it. And you know, those, when you'd be fighting for the championship,

102
00:08:00.36 --> 00:08:06.76
and I'd be watching going, come on, man, come on. And then you would. But you know what I do?

103
00:08:06.76 --> 00:08:11.72
I'd like turn off the TV and go back to work. And you'd have to do, you know,

104
00:08:11.72 --> 00:08:16.84
suffer through the loss and all that. I mean, it like hurt me a little bit. But like I said,

105
00:08:16.84 --> 00:08:22.28
I just like grabbed another freaking piece of chicken and carried on with my day. You had to like,

106
00:08:22.28 --> 00:08:28.04
look at all your sacrifice. Everything that was going on. How the army was looking at you,

107
00:08:28.04 --> 00:08:35.08
how the rest of your friends were looking at you. Oh, yeah, humiliation is a powerful tool for

108
00:08:35.08 --> 00:08:40.20
good sometimes. You know, I know we're like, we can't fat shame people these days. But like I was

109
00:08:40.20 --> 00:08:45.64
shamed in moments. And that that shame, first time on an ODA, like the mistakes I made,

110
00:08:45.64 --> 00:08:49.80
I'm still embarrassed thinking back to the way that I behaved as a new guy on a team. Do that

111
00:08:49.80 --> 00:08:57.000
shame is so powerful. You know, it's so important. That's pretty legit. And you know, that's,

112
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.36
I guess that's what, that's what makes any, any like a book or yeah, I guess any book or writing or

113
00:09:04.36 --> 00:09:09.40
talk that you're going to give is how honest you are about who, you know, where you came from and

114
00:09:09.40 --> 00:09:15.40
what happened along the way. You are very honest. Man, you're so honest sometimes I was like,

115
00:09:15.40 --> 00:09:22.44
maybe you shouldn't put that in there. I'll be in in 2022, right? You're on social media,

116
00:09:23.24 --> 00:09:30.44
the fake fabrication. That is the current existence that we live in, right? The news is is eight

117
00:09:30.44 --> 00:09:37.80
second headlines. That's not truth. It's just little tiny, tiny bits. Every single social media

118
00:09:38.60 --> 00:09:44.52
is curated and editorialized. You know, it's a filter that makes me feel good. It's my best moment

119
00:09:44.52 --> 00:09:49.48
with the best light. You know, and even if it's like, here's me struggling. It's like me walking

120
00:09:49.48 --> 00:09:53.32
into an interview and so it's like, hey, tell me something that's not great about yourself. Well,

121
00:09:53.32 --> 00:09:57.32
honestly, I work too hard. Yeah, I'm the only thing is I'm a perfectionist. Yeah, I'm going

122
00:09:57.32 --> 00:10:00.60
to relax. Yeah, I'm going to relax. Yeah, I'm going to relax. Yeah, I'm going to relax. Yeah,

123
00:10:00.60 --> 00:10:05.08
not get off. You know, and that's like our world right now. And I think people have been starving

124
00:10:05.08 --> 00:10:12.04
for truth and transparency and they want invulnerability. And we've, I'm starving for it. You

125
00:10:12.04 --> 00:10:16.92
know, like, when I, one of the main reasons why I love listening to you and I love your books

126
00:10:16.92 --> 00:10:21.56
is it's just like, this is real. This is who I am. This is my approach to things. It's not for

127
00:10:21.56 --> 00:10:26.36
everybody. You know, like, I'm not going to get up at 430 AM, but like this is you and I love that.

128
00:10:26.36 --> 00:10:29.80
You know, one of the many reasons that the circle of friends that I have is like, they're just

129
00:10:29.80 --> 00:10:35.16
the real humans that they say that they are where everything else around means fake. Yeah, you know,

130
00:10:35.16 --> 00:10:41.80
even so in the book Extreme Ownership, the opening chapter is we had a blue on blue. I was in

131
00:10:41.80 --> 00:10:46.44
charge. I'm from the Iraqi soldier got killed. One of my guys got wounded a few other Iraqi soldiers

132
00:10:46.44 --> 00:10:52.92
got wounded as well. And when I got home from that deployment, I would brief everybody. I mean,

133
00:10:52.92 --> 00:10:57.72
I would brief every silver tune, every seal team that was going out. I had a full brief about

134
00:10:57.72 --> 00:11:01.24
exactly what happened, what went wrong, how you can defend it from happening, how we prevented it

135
00:11:01.24 --> 00:11:08.12
from happening again. And why was my fault that this happened? And as we were writing Extreme Ownership,

136
00:11:08.12 --> 00:11:12.76
that chapter wasn't in there. And we talked about a bunch of other little mistakes that I made

137
00:11:12.76 --> 00:11:16.36
and Dave talked about some mistakes that he made and hey, we should have done this better and here's

138
00:11:17.08 --> 00:11:23.08
and finally one day, Dave was like, hey, you know the blue on blue and I'm like, yeah, and he says,

139
00:11:23.08 --> 00:11:28.20
you should put that in here. And I said, I thought about it. And of course, my mind I'm like,

140
00:11:28.20 --> 00:11:35.16
damn it. Now I got to tell everybody that, oh, this big combat operation, the, as far as I'm

141
00:11:35.16 --> 00:11:40.20
concerned, the worst thing that can happen in the war is friendly fire. Yeah. And I got to happen.

142
00:11:40.20 --> 00:11:45.24
Yeah, I got to put myself on report for doing that and being in charge of it. And you know,

143
00:11:45.24 --> 00:11:49.08
I was like, yeah, absolutely, I do. And so when I got done writing the chapter, I was like, well,

144
00:11:49.08 --> 00:11:52.68
here, I go, hey, bro, here's the first chapter because if we're going to go hard,

145
00:11:52.68 --> 00:11:56.60
let's just let everybody know what's up out of the gate. Yeah. And he was like, absolutely. So

146
00:11:57.32 --> 00:12:03.48
I think that's the same reason that that book hits people. This is the same way that your book hits

147
00:12:03.48 --> 00:12:10.52
where you're like, man, some heavy shit you're going to have to do. But you can't do it another way.

148
00:12:10.52 --> 00:12:14.76
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can. Yeah, you can. But then you're just a liar. Yeah. Yeah. Then you're just like,

149
00:12:14.76 --> 00:12:20.20
everybody else out there in this current generation, this age where, um, and I don't want to be that,

150
00:12:20.20 --> 00:12:28.76
you know, I'd rather continue to suffer. I'd still continue to learn from my pain and make mistakes.

151
00:12:28.76 --> 00:12:36.04
Hopefully, fewer of them. And uh, we'll see how that shakes out. Right on. All right, let's, let's

152
00:12:36.04 --> 00:12:39.56
go back to the beginning a little bit where you came from and all this. I'm going to go to the book for a second.

153
00:12:41.08 --> 00:12:44.28
Because it's a pretty good opener. It's gives a good assessment right here. It says,

154
00:12:44.28 --> 00:12:48.12
I'm an A typical dude with an with a typical parents and an A typical childhood.

155
00:12:48.84 --> 00:12:54.20
I don't exactly know how I ended up like this, but here's my closest guess as to the recipe that made

156
00:12:54.20 --> 00:12:59.96
me to start at three cups of I grew up in the 80s. So like many of you Jen X types,

157
00:12:59.96 --> 00:13:04.44
every day was an adventure that were no cell phones, no helicopter parents. We left in the

158
00:13:04.44 --> 00:13:09.24
morning and came home when the street lights came on. Then at two teaspoons of my mom, a highly

159
00:13:09.24 --> 00:13:18.12
educated, classically liberal woman who value books, arts, and dance. She probably fit best,

160
00:13:18.12 --> 00:13:22.28
teaching at any least, Easter, West Coast College, and anywhere else on the planet. Now,

161
00:13:22.28 --> 00:13:29.56
add three heaping tablespoons of my dad and elite counter-narcotics officer who literally was going

162
00:13:29.56 --> 00:13:35.72
up against Pablo Escobar on the daily at the peak of the war on drugs. He had seen the worst in

163
00:13:35.72 --> 00:13:41.08
life and wanted his children to be tough, quick thinking, A and able to survive in any condition.

164
00:13:41.08 --> 00:13:46.52
He valued martial arts, gunwork, and more risk-taking than most parents would feel comfortable

165
00:13:46.52 --> 00:13:53.40
allowing. Finally, add one bucket of my insurmountable drive to prove I can do anything and you now

166
00:13:53.40 --> 00:14:02.92
have an idea of what makes me me. You were a homeschooled. That's right. Right. So what's that?

167
00:14:02.92 --> 00:14:07.24
Do you own homeschooled before homeschooling was even a thing? Yep. It wasn't a thing. It's a thing.

168
00:14:07.24 --> 00:14:11.48
I grew up in the 70s, but it definitely wasn't a thing in the 70s. By the time I had kids,

169
00:14:11.48 --> 00:14:17.80
homeschooling was a thing, I homeschooled one of my kids. It wasn't a thing though in the 80s.

170
00:14:17.80 --> 00:14:24.36
No. Where did your parents even come up with that? They were radicals. They were radical

171
00:14:24.36 --> 00:14:31.56
centrist in the sense that they believed in the Roosevelt idea of what a citizen is. It is my job

172
00:14:31.56 --> 00:14:36.44
to be self-sufficient. It is the individual responsibility to be a providing protect for my family.

173
00:14:36.44 --> 00:14:42.36
As a contributing member of society, as a good citizen of America, so that old school

174
00:14:42.36 --> 00:14:49.32
Roosevelt approach to being a good citizen, it is our job to educate my children. It is not the

175
00:14:49.32 --> 00:14:54.60
government's job to do anything. That is how my parents subscribed. Religion, ethics, morality,

176
00:14:56.20 --> 00:15:03.16
the classical part. We had box seats in the San Francisco Symphony, Deves Hall. We travel

177
00:15:03.16 --> 00:15:09.72
all over the nation to go to opera and ballet and a group on Chikowsky's watching beautiful

178
00:15:09.72 --> 00:15:16.28
little bannerinas move around and remember that Chikowsky's composer that swan lake.

179
00:15:17.64 --> 00:15:23.08
So this is when you made that freak and swan lake for the year. All those years ago, there was

180
00:15:23.08 --> 00:15:30.20
such a real. There was some time in that. I remember like thinking, okay. There's layers there.

181
00:15:30.20 --> 00:15:36.84
Yeah, I did it now. When I was born, I was born with a bad heart murmur.

182
00:15:36.84 --> 00:15:42.52
And I was a runt to child compared to the rest of my family. My dad's a giant Olympian water

183
00:15:42.52 --> 00:15:48.52
pull a player, my brothers and child. My actual Olympian water pull a freak. Still to this day,

184
00:15:48.52 --> 00:15:53.80
when you're standing next to this guy that's still a plain full cocaine from Pauleyska Bar

185
00:15:53.80 --> 00:16:00.84
and you know, he's 6, 3, 280 pounds. You're just kind of like, you're unnerved in his space.

186
00:16:00.84 --> 00:16:06.04
He's courgarious. He's so sweet, but you're also like, do I make eye contact with him? Yeah.

187
00:16:07.08 --> 00:16:11.72
But being small and being a runt, I had like a ship on my shoulder.

188
00:16:11.72 --> 00:16:18.60
And I walked out all of you. I'm 511. So you're 511, but you were, but you had like Napoleon

189
00:16:18.60 --> 00:16:25.56
and you were 511. Yeah, 220 pound Harry, and I'm nothing compared to the rest of my family's

190
00:16:25.56 --> 00:16:32.36
athletic gifts. So like that, that teaspoon of crazy part, you know, that was me just trying to

191
00:16:32.36 --> 00:16:37.08
keep up. That was me just trying to be with my big brother who is faster and stronger and his

192
00:16:37.08 --> 00:16:42.68
friends were bigger and meaner. So like that came to be a pretty big driving force for me.

193
00:16:42.68 --> 00:16:47.40
And this was all taken place in up and around San Luis Obesma. Yep. And a task of

194
00:16:47.40 --> 00:16:55.32
a pass-a-roll bulls, just tell Patent, Cambria, which is some of the most amazing, just region of

195
00:16:55.32 --> 00:17:00.84
the world is. We've been everywhere. We've been everywhere, right? And I still go home. I go to

196
00:17:00.84 --> 00:17:05.88
my my parents' property. It's in in law-quad. Right off of Lake Nassie, I met him. We back up to

197
00:17:05.88 --> 00:17:13.08
camp Roberts. And just amazing. Truly elk walking through my parents yard, you know, and

198
00:17:13.08 --> 00:17:18.60
I'm looking down the backside of the Hurst Castle property. We look at the mountains.

199
00:17:19.40 --> 00:17:25.96
And it is so wild that I'm in California when I'm there. It's so beautiful and it's so

200
00:17:25.96 --> 00:17:28.44
serene and then I'm like California.

201
00:17:31.88 --> 00:17:36.76
There was like a movement a little while ago to make to separate California to different

202
00:17:36.76 --> 00:17:41.96
three regions. All those like, yes, yes. I think it just needs to be too

203
00:17:41.96 --> 00:17:47.16
read or I guess yeah, two regions. One of the regions would be San Francisco and L.A.

204
00:17:47.16 --> 00:17:51.40
And then at California to the rest of it. Yep. That got pretty cool. It'll be pretty awesome. Yeah,

205
00:17:51.40 --> 00:17:59.56
never gonna happen. So you're running around as a kid. You're doing just full on kid stuff.

206
00:17:59.56 --> 00:18:07.32
You're freaking running around the world. You got the Creek gang. Yep. There's no one monitoring

207
00:18:07.32 --> 00:18:13.000
shit with you. No, I mean, there's no parental. It's so difficult for people now to understand

208
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.48
what it was like in the 80s. You know, bicycle helmet's not gonna happen. Oh, you know, when I say

209
00:18:18.44 --> 00:18:25.000
we leave it sunrise and come back at sunset, it wasn't the door was locked. Like we could not come home.

210
00:18:25.72 --> 00:18:28.76
You know, my mom would close the screen door and had one of those latches and should latch

211
00:18:28.76 --> 00:18:32.92
that thing. And we would knock on the door when the sun went down to come in to get dinner. I'll

212
00:18:32.92 --> 00:18:38.76
say to that, you got 10 hours to pretty much be a fair, a fair, a fair or rather child.

213
00:18:39.64 --> 00:18:44.76
And you spend time in the water, too. You're like a waterman, too, right? 100%. Yeah. You know,

214
00:18:44.76 --> 00:18:51.64
with a dad that was water polo pool in the backyard, our house was where everybody would go.

215
00:18:51.64 --> 00:18:56.36
It was like the center of gravity for our church and our community. So every Friday, the whole

216
00:18:56.36 --> 00:19:00.28
entire city was pretty much invited to our house. So we would have a few hundred people at our

217
00:19:00.28 --> 00:19:05.72
house every Friday and it was a made lay pit in that pool. You know, only the strong survived.

218
00:19:06.92 --> 00:19:12.92
It was bad. I don't know how kids didn't die. Like to this day, board of the flies type things.

219
00:19:12.92 --> 00:19:19.40
I have not pool. And, but, you know, with the the coast being right there, Maro Bay, you know,

220
00:19:19.40 --> 00:19:25.000
spear fishing, scuba diving. I got my patty junior scuba diving license at 13. The other

221
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.88
as a surfer kid growing up, before I was allowed to scuba diving, like we're free diving, you know,

222
00:19:29.88 --> 00:19:37.32
using Hawaiian slings and spear fishing. We would swim out to rocker to the breakers and we would take

223
00:19:37.32 --> 00:19:45.40
a broom handle with a wire close hanger and a attach a fishing lure to the end of it. And we'd

224
00:19:45.40 --> 00:19:51.40
swim out all the way out to the breakers, like, you know, a quarter mile off of beach. And we would

225
00:19:51.40 --> 00:19:56.60
call it, we called poke hole fishing. And I'd take this dowel with this long broken wire that I'd

226
00:19:56.60 --> 00:20:02.84
bend into like this crescent. And I'd dip it over the corners of these rocks 10, 10 feet down

227
00:20:02.84 --> 00:20:08.44
as the ways are to smash into the breakers. But we'd get the rock cod that weren't so far out

228
00:20:08.44 --> 00:20:12.84
that the fish that the boats would get, but not, but they're big enough because they weren't by the beach.

229
00:20:12.84 --> 00:20:17.56
So I would, I would get five six rock cod a couple of hours, but I just had indoor getting my

230
00:20:17.56 --> 00:20:25.000
ass being on the rocks. It's, uh, man, it's kind of strange. You didn't end up in the navy. I wanted to.

231
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.48
Yeah. When I, on 9-11, the navy office was closed. So the marine office was open. I talked to them

232
00:20:33.48 --> 00:20:40.68
first. And the army office was open. And, uh, on 9-12, nothing was really open on 9-11.

233
00:20:40.68 --> 00:20:44.52
It wasn't until the day after that I finally got to talk to recruiter and that was the

234
00:20:44.52 --> 00:20:49.56
Marines and the army first. Yeah, because that just weren't working. That was, yeah,

235
00:20:49.56 --> 00:20:56.52
it was just nobody's shocker. The, uh, the, uh, because the waters such a huge obstacle in, in

236
00:20:56.52 --> 00:21:02.04
buds. Yeah. And it's also, it's also like part of being in the sealtains like you're in the water a lot.

237
00:21:02.04 --> 00:21:07.000
So if you grow up in the water, it's kind of, it's kind of nice to be able to return to it from time to time.

238
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.56
Um, so you're growing up and, and let me jump into the book here. And again, look, I'm,

239
00:21:13.56 --> 00:21:19.88
I'm like reading a small percentage of this book. The stories in here are amazing. I want to hit on one of them right now.

240
00:21:21.16 --> 00:21:27.72
Uh, here we go. Jared and Jordan, counting him two members of the Creek gang and two of my best friends

241
00:21:27.72 --> 00:21:33.56
on planet earth. We're heading to a party driven by teenagers and two separate cars. When I say

242
00:21:33.56 --> 00:21:38.76
heading to a party, I mean, that an elamest, most wholesome possible way. They weren't going to

243
00:21:38.76 --> 00:21:44.28
some Hollywood style teenage kegger. They were going to hang out at someone's house and play games.

244
00:21:44.28 --> 00:21:50.52
Maybe if things got wild, they'll, they'd wrestle in the grass. Just good wholesome fun. It was a

245
00:21:50.52 --> 00:21:57.88
kid's a church kid hang out. But church kids are still kids. And as you've seen for me, and you know

246
00:21:57.88 --> 00:22:04.60
from your own childhood, hood kids do dumb things. The two teenage drivers finding themselves alone on a

247
00:22:04.60 --> 00:22:10.60
long country road started racing each other, taking turns passing each other in the oncoming traffic lane.

248
00:22:10.60 --> 00:22:18.68
It was Jared's cars turn to speed by and they slid out from behind Jordan's car and started to pass.

249
00:22:19.24 --> 00:22:24.52
The brothers were right next to each other. They're respective drivers in mid-exeleration in that horrible moment.

250
00:22:24.52 --> 00:22:31.48
I know what the moment was like as do you. Boys yelling at each other through windows, laughing,

251
00:22:31.48 --> 00:22:36.12
swearing, feeling the invincible rush of adrenaline filled youth.

252
00:22:38.84 --> 00:22:43.64
Then the armed coming car came around the corner. They were doing nothing wrong, just

253
00:22:43.64 --> 00:22:49.40
mining their own business, doing some last minute shopping before Christmas. Neither drivers saw the

254
00:22:49.40 --> 00:22:58.52
other in time to hit the brakes or swore of Jared died. Age 13, December 20, 1994,

255
00:22:59.96 --> 00:23:04.28
five days before Christmas in front of his 16 year old brother Jordan.

256
00:23:11.56 --> 00:23:16.04
So, yeah that's that's gonna be a mark.

257
00:23:16.04 --> 00:23:25.64
The kind of hands they were lead cutting him was the discerning prosecutor for San Luis Pizpo.

258
00:23:26.76 --> 00:23:33.96
Jordan was like the quintessential hero. If Friday night lights the movie was made, like he is

259
00:23:33.96 --> 00:23:43.48
that the gorgeous athletic, everybody, you know he's the smartest and Jared had all of that going

260
00:23:43.48 --> 00:23:48.60
with him. That family was really not just the most pop popular family in the city, but like they

261
00:23:48.60 --> 00:23:56.28
are the most generous and kind and sweetest people. So, like that law, when Jared died,

262
00:23:57.24 --> 00:24:01.72
your children had to live with the Jared Brady law. That was because of Jared cutting him.

263
00:24:02.76 --> 00:24:07.16
You can't drive under the age of 18 with other kids in your car. That was because of this.

264
00:24:07.16 --> 00:24:14.84
Wow. And, you know, Jordan, being my brothers, one of my brother's best friends and Jared,

265
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:22.60
being one of my best friends, it is such a crucial moment, you know, in that like post-pubescent,

266
00:24:22.60 --> 00:24:28.52
you know, you're still figuring out who you are. Frontal lobes not working yet. And when tragedy

267
00:24:28.52 --> 00:24:36.92
like this happens, it just reshapes and reorganizes everything. And the city just one rallied around

268
00:24:36.92 --> 00:24:42.84
the cutting him, which was really cool to see. But that generation, that little group,

269
00:24:42.84 --> 00:24:46.04
you know, they're a whole bunch of my friends from that era, our dead now,

270
00:24:46.68 --> 00:24:53.96
the committed suicide, or they lived a very reckless life as did I. So, you know,

271
00:24:53.96 --> 00:24:57.72
had a second and third order effects that lasted for decades.

272
00:24:58.76 --> 00:25:03.88
An interesting thing about the book is like like we've been talking about, it's very humble

273
00:25:03.88 --> 00:25:08.28
for you to point this out, but you'll go through these things where there should be some big

274
00:25:08.28 --> 00:25:13.96
lesson learned. And you'll literally say like, this was a huge lesson that I could have learned.

275
00:25:15.08 --> 00:25:23.000
And I missed it. And I mean, this kind of like what happens here, this doesn't slow you down at all.

276
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.96
I mean, you're still like just going wild as a kid, doing normal kid shit. Yeah, and it sounds

277
00:25:27.96 --> 00:25:37.08
like everyone else was, too. Yeah. The, there is a direct intent from us to not point out any lessons

278
00:25:37.08 --> 00:25:45.16
and anything. I wanted people to learn not from an antidotal, hey, here, here's what you should do.

279
00:25:45.16 --> 00:25:52.68
Instead, here's the repercussions of it. Are you smart enough to extrapolate out of this,

280
00:25:52.68 --> 00:25:58.84
what you need to do to not make the same mistake? Hopefully people are smart enough to realize

281
00:25:59.40 --> 00:26:05.16
the consequences of every single one of these things? Yeah. So you're running around. I mean,

282
00:26:05.16 --> 00:26:10.52
you're getting in fights, you're getting jobs, you're getting fired, you're attacking people.

283
00:26:11.16 --> 00:26:17.96
It's just ridiculous. Well, you're attacking. Even though I was being an absolute psychopath.

284
00:26:17.96 --> 00:26:25.72
So, at an outburger, where I get fired when they fire their best fry guy. Yeah, Steve.

285
00:26:27.40 --> 00:26:33.32
There was a, like, she legitimately got assaulted, you know, and maybe a 134 year old boy

286
00:26:33.32 --> 00:26:38.92
when my 1112 year old sister, when she gets like inappropriately touched by dude, like, I thrown

287
00:26:38.92 --> 00:26:43.72
through a phone booth. Like, that's what you do. You know, when I was five years old, when I got

288
00:26:43.72 --> 00:26:48.60
with the reason I got home schooled is I got kicked out of private school. You know, in my parents

289
00:26:48.60 --> 00:26:52.84
were already homeschooling my brother, but so that was going to be an option, but they're going to see

290
00:26:52.84 --> 00:26:58.44
if if this little hairy handed idiot was going to be able to handle school. See if he can be civilized

291
00:26:58.44 --> 00:27:03.32
and so-so-living. Could not happen. No, a little dude made fun of Laura's hair. She got a little

292
00:27:03.32 --> 00:27:07.32
bull cut and I followed him up onto the place gate, punched at the grill and I shoved him off and he

293
00:27:07.32 --> 00:27:13.64
broke his arm. That's not my fault. So by the time I'm 16, you know, and I have a little bit of

294
00:27:13.64 --> 00:27:19.96
testosterone finally going on and somebody touches Brianna. I'm like a dart, a lawn dart across that

295
00:27:19.96 --> 00:27:25.000
polished stainless steel counter into this dude as I drag him out the front door after beating him.

296
00:27:27.40 --> 00:27:33.000
So at some point, it sounds like your dad realizes you need some kind of harness, some kind of

297
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:42.20
direction and then comes wrestling, other martial arts. What's that like? It's weird because you

298
00:27:42.20 --> 00:27:48.04
wrestled, but you weren't allowed to wrestle in like the CIF. It's right California State Problem.

299
00:27:48.04 --> 00:27:53.88
Home schooled program. That's home schooled. So now there's mechanisms. Yeah, there's mechanisms

300
00:27:53.88 --> 00:28:01.24
now. But in 1985. They thought they would deal with the freaking cult member. They were.

301
00:28:01.24 --> 00:28:08.04
They were. They were too. So, you know, I would like club wrestling, freestyle wrestling.

302
00:28:08.04 --> 00:28:14.20
I could do Greco camps. I could go to drop internaments. You know, but there was no, there was the

303
00:28:14.20 --> 00:28:20.04
collegiate approach to wrestling. Not accessible to a home school and kid. So how old were you

304
00:28:20.04 --> 00:28:26.36
started wrestling? 10. And then you were your dad was getting you into other like traditional

305
00:28:26.36 --> 00:28:31.64
martial arts as well. What do you got? Docon, jujitsu. What was that all about? Yeah, that was the

306
00:28:31.64 --> 00:28:39.000
Japanese. Take out a yeah, kid jujitsu. You know, you go like, hallowed Gracie, the origin of it is

307
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.04
Japanese jujitsu. So this was a very, very traditional Japanese jujitsu school. So you'd still do,

308
00:28:47.08 --> 00:28:52.84
stick fighting, you know, a screamless sticks and boasts, boasts, and a little bit of weapon,

309
00:28:52.84 --> 00:29:01.40
takeaways, wrist locks, striking, but very traditional Japanese striking. And I loved it.

310
00:29:01.40 --> 00:29:07.24
My favorite part was the grappling part of it. So it turned, you know, like I played around in clubs

311
00:29:07.24 --> 00:29:17.96
with the in wrestling and Taekwondo and karate. You know, wasn't until about 15,

312
00:29:17.96 --> 00:29:24.92
where it was a mandated activity where my dad was like, you will go do this. And that's was

313
00:29:24.92 --> 00:29:31.32
that was jujitsu in wrestling. It got real at 15, 16. And then you could only compete in just club

314
00:29:31.32 --> 00:29:35.96
tournaments. You couldn't compete in the CIF. That's right. How'd you do against kids that were good

315
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:41.48
wrestlers from from that were wrestling in CIF? I guess mashed. Yeah, everywhere. My first,

316
00:29:42.76 --> 00:29:48.68
my first tournament was a single elimination tournament and I got pinned in like 38 seconds. And

317
00:29:50.12 --> 00:29:57.000
in the gymnasium, big, huge, you know, old school wooden floor, gymnasium with like the wooden

318
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:06.60
bleachers. You could hear every echo. And I could, I swear, I could hear my embarrassment.

319
00:30:07.56 --> 00:30:12.28
Like echoing off the walls. Like I just got louder and louder. And I couldn't look at my dad

320
00:30:12.28 --> 00:30:16.60
who is next to me. You know, I know he was, you know, he was cheering for me as a short match and

321
00:30:16.60 --> 00:30:23.40
he was disappointed. And of course, he's like, come on, bud, you're all right. Let's go. So I was so embarrassed.

322
00:30:23.40 --> 00:30:28.68
I was showing you your dad is such a beast. We got this freaking scrawny kid that's got his ass beef.

323
00:30:29.80 --> 00:30:34.44
I'm just going to leave you here, son. Sorry. I remember the first tournament, first high school

324
00:30:34.44 --> 00:30:40.68
tournament that my son wrestled in. He was so he had might have just turned 14. And

325
00:30:41.88 --> 00:30:46.84
and he might have even still been 13. Anyways, he was young. But he was on the varsity team

326
00:30:46.84 --> 00:30:51.80
because it's pretty good. And so when he taken to the big tournament, there's 64 people in the bracket.

327
00:30:51.80 --> 00:30:57.80
He's the 64th seed because he's a little kid. And the first, so he's going up against the number

328
00:30:57.80 --> 00:31:03.96
one or number two seed in the first, his first match. And this dude comes out. He's got, he's freaking

329
00:31:03.96 --> 00:31:11.56
got like a full firefighter's mustache. He's like 19, a full grown ass man, right? Like just a man.

330
00:31:11.56 --> 00:31:16.84
He had a big ass tattoo on his arm. And I looked at my son and said, hey, no matter what happens,

331
00:31:16.84 --> 00:31:22.28
you just hold your head up high. We walk off this side. He got 10 30 seconds. Yeah. It's like,

332
00:31:22.28 --> 00:31:26.92
what are those things? There's something good about that, though, man. It's so important. It's so

333
00:31:26.92 --> 00:31:33.88
important. I can't, I can't, even though I think back, I'm humiliated, shameful moment, right?

334
00:31:33.88 --> 00:31:37.96
We're like, my dad wouldn't look at me for a second. And that might even be like projected my own

335
00:31:37.96 --> 00:31:42.20
brain. I'm sure he was just sitting there being like, come over here, son. But my brain, like,

336
00:31:42.20 --> 00:31:48.60
he looked away in that glance, like, just was a knife in my chest. That shame going on and being

337
00:31:48.60 --> 00:31:53.40
able to like hang with the Rashad Evans and the John Jones is, you know, 15 years later, that would never

338
00:31:53.40 --> 00:31:59.72
ever, ever happen without me standing there as a pathetic loser, getting destroyed in seconds.

339
00:31:59.72 --> 00:32:03.80
In my first match, there's no participation trophy. There's no coach being like, hey, that was

340
00:32:03.80 --> 00:32:09.72
great match. You tried your hardest. You know, he came over and he was like, you suck. You know,

341
00:32:09.72 --> 00:32:15.72
I, I hope I don't have to see you on Monday. Please don't come back. You know, but I showed up

342
00:32:15.72 --> 00:32:21.48
because I was furious. And if that, that, that fire is so important and it's not being a

343
00:32:21.48 --> 00:32:29.24
harnessed right now, because it's, it's absent from this generation. Yeah. And we, we have to let

344
00:32:29.24 --> 00:32:35.40
people fail again. Yeah, that even for me, like the first time I ever did, Jiu Jitsu against this old

345
00:32:35.40 --> 00:32:39.72
master chief who was probably like 10 years younger than I am right now, but he seemed like the oldest

346
00:32:39.72 --> 00:32:44.60
dude in the world. And, you know, he just like choked me out on mock me and I was like, oh, I'm literally

347
00:32:44.60 --> 00:32:47.88
thinking, whatever this dude knows, I'm going to do everything in my power to learn everything about

348
00:32:47.88 --> 00:32:52.60
it, because I don't ever want this to happen again. This is, this is what I'm doing. Yeah. And,

349
00:32:52.60 --> 00:32:59.08
and you gotta get your ass beats. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. It is good for you. When somebody's

350
00:32:59.08 --> 00:33:04.44
lecturing me about some significant thing about, you know, hard work or, you know, how,

351
00:33:04.44 --> 00:33:09.56
how somebody should do something, I always look at him like, have you ever been hit in the face?

352
00:33:10.44 --> 00:33:16.12
You know, have you ever had your ass beat? Have you ever lose so bad? You, you felt like you

353
00:33:16.12 --> 00:33:21.24
couldn't breathe and they're trying to impart some ways down like, I can't listen to you.

354
00:33:21.24 --> 00:33:24.60
Yeah, there's nothing else you can say. And then there's a dividing line too, because some

355
00:33:24.60 --> 00:33:29.48
people when they feel that, they just want to avoid that thing forever for our show life. And that's a

356
00:33:29.48 --> 00:33:34.68
bummer because that's just the wrong path to go down. Some people when they experience that, like,

357
00:33:34.68 --> 00:33:41.56
oh, this other human being can hold me and do what every wants to me. And I hate that. Yeah,

358
00:33:41.56 --> 00:33:44.92
I'm going to do everything I can to be able to stop that from happening in the future.

359
00:33:44.92 --> 00:33:48.12
Well, that's an, that's evolution. That's that application, right? So, like, if I put my hand

360
00:33:48.12 --> 00:33:52.28
on something, I'm burn my hand. I'm going to learn not to put my hand there. If I go with this

361
00:33:52.28 --> 00:33:58.60
really brilliant crazy hot chick on the like hot crazy scale, she cheats on me with this other

362
00:33:58.60 --> 00:34:03.64
better look and do that has more money. Hopefully, I emotionally learn that I maybe should not

363
00:34:03.64 --> 00:34:08.12
find somebody that looks like that and behaves like this. I'm going to pick somebody slightly different.

364
00:34:08.12 --> 00:34:13.56
Like those are all painful lessons to learn. And that's how we adapt. And like the, the

365
00:34:13.56 --> 00:34:21.16
adaptation process should involve pain. Pain is the, is, is the thing that fuels the change.

366
00:34:21.16 --> 00:34:28.92
I'm going to fast forward a little bit in the book. This is good. Yeah, it's tasty.

367
00:34:32.76 --> 00:34:39.72
So here I am at slow kickboxing, walking into the one of the most dilapidated buildings I've ever

368
00:34:39.72 --> 00:34:44.52
seen. I'm going to be training with a rising star in the UFC a guy by the name of Chuck Ladell,

369
00:34:44.52 --> 00:34:49.96
alongside his merry band of badasses. First, we have GAN McGee, and that was 300 pound

370
00:34:49.96 --> 00:34:54.76
wrestler from Cal Poly who fought for the UFC World Championship against Tim Sylvia, again,

371
00:34:54.76 --> 00:35:00.04
lost, but Tim Popfer steroids that in that fight. Next, we have Eric Schwartz, another Cal Poly

372
00:35:00.04 --> 00:35:07.16
wrestler who is undefeated in WEC and K1 Kickboxing circuit. He's Chuck's main training partner.

373
00:35:07.96 --> 00:35:14.12
Never far from him was Scott Lates out Lidey, a K1 Kickboxer and mixed martial artist. Then

374
00:35:14.12 --> 00:35:20.12
there's Jason Vaughn Flu, you know, the guy that the famous jujitsu choke is named after. That guy.

375
00:35:20.68 --> 00:35:27.40
Cruz Gomez is the only little guy in the mix. Meaning he was about my size, 511 170,

376
00:35:28.04 --> 00:35:35.08
but what he lacked in statuary made up for an abject savagery. Finally, there's Glover Texturea,

377
00:35:35.08 --> 00:35:40.20
but jujitsu badass would go on to become the UFC champion with the most subs at light,

378
00:35:40.20 --> 00:35:47.24
heavyweight in UFC history. To rough room. That's a freak. That's a freak. That's them.

379
00:35:47.24 --> 00:35:52.76
You get to get some trade in it. Yeah, and then there's John Hackelman, who is just, you know, he was

380
00:35:54.76 --> 00:35:59.40
sat there with a hot iron poker of emotional because he knew all of our buttons and he was just like

381
00:36:01.96 --> 00:36:07.96
just walk around instigating, says a psychopath. I love him so much. And so he's how do you

382
00:36:07.96 --> 00:36:14.20
found the pit? So, Hawaiian Kempo. Yeah. And he got his black belt. When he was in the army,

383
00:36:14.20 --> 00:36:19.000
he was boxing and he was traveling and he got stationed in Hawaii. And while he was there, he

384
00:36:21.32 --> 00:36:26.92
grossly summarizing falls in love with Hawaiian Kempo. You know, ultimately, it becomes a black

385
00:36:26.92 --> 00:36:32.04
belt and Hawaiian Kempo comes back to a royal grandeur where he opens up the pit in his backyard.

386
00:36:32.04 --> 00:36:38.44
Um, this was before that even had a cage built back there. It was like a rope ring inside of a

387
00:36:38.44 --> 00:36:45.96
bar and outside barn. And we had his hill. We had a will barrel and we had sandbags. And that was

388
00:36:45.96 --> 00:36:50.68
all the apparatus that we had to train to, you know, which became a whole bunch of warm champions.

389
00:36:51.24 --> 00:36:55.40
But that was it. And then he opened up his actual martial art school, you know, the

390
00:36:55.40 --> 00:37:02.12
in a royal grandeur, the pit. And then sandless bispo kickboxing wasn't offshoot of the pit, where

391
00:37:02.12 --> 00:37:10.68
we had the ring, the an actual mat for us to wrestle. Not in the grass or dirt, which was nicer.

392
00:37:11.88 --> 00:37:20.84
So you're sparring Chakudel. How old are you at this time? I am 18. And what's, how was

393
00:37:20.84 --> 00:37:29.56
Chakudel? He is 26. A 26-year-old Chakudel. And then the rest of the guys in that room being around

394
00:37:29.56 --> 00:37:36.28
that age, too. I imagine. Yeah. Yeah. It was wild about this room is like Eric Schwartz. Nobody

395
00:37:36.28 --> 00:37:41.88
knows that name. You know, I think he retired like 12-0. He only retired because Chakudel retired.

396
00:37:41.88 --> 00:37:46.28
He was really only fighting so he could stay relevant for his best friend Chakudel. That was

397
00:37:46.28 --> 00:37:52.60
he was the best in the room. Then he had Scott Adams, who also retired as an undefeated UFC fighter.

398
00:37:52.60 --> 00:37:59.08
Well, I think the first three leglocks in the UFC were from Scott Adams. And I think you have a

399
00:37:59.08 --> 00:38:07.08
share of a poem with him in Monson. Oh yeah, yeah. I think they fought in the UFC really, really early.

400
00:38:07.08 --> 00:38:12.68
Did Scott win? Yeah, leglock. Yeah. And yeah, there's that video. There's a video of me in Jeff

401
00:38:12.68 --> 00:38:21.16
Monson. And unfortunately, it's like a three-minute video. And the match was triple over time.

402
00:38:21.88 --> 00:38:27.000
So like, I've seen the full video though. Yeah. It's not on YouTube. Oh, okay. But I,

403
00:38:27.56 --> 00:38:31.64
man, where did I see it? That was one of the most competitive. And this was peak Monson.

404
00:38:31.64 --> 00:38:37.96
When you fought him. Yeah. This is wooded out of his gill. This is like, you could see all of the

405
00:38:37.96 --> 00:38:42.52
deep all. Like there's a pumping out of his neck. And the testosterone was like dripping out of his eye.

406
00:38:42.52 --> 00:38:48.04
Like this was like anabolic steroid Monson of massive emotions. That was a badass mess.

407
00:38:48.04 --> 00:38:53.80
Oh, yeah. But also very technically. That was good to you. You should do it. Oh, yeah, for sure.

408
00:38:53.80 --> 00:38:58.60
No, it was. Obviously. No, that was a great match. I don't know. I don't know. I don't just like

409
00:38:58.60 --> 00:39:02.52
anybody else. You know, I look back. That was so long. I look at that. Oh my god. What am I doing with my

410
00:39:02.52 --> 00:39:06.52
hips over there? What was my weight? You know, you look at these. Thank you, your prophetic. But um,

411
00:39:06.52 --> 00:39:13.72
good times. Yeah. But that room, even the no names were just could have been world champions.

412
00:39:13.72 --> 00:39:21.08
Yeah. You know, again, that when he lost at Tim Sylvia, um, lost, you know,

413
00:39:21.08 --> 00:39:28.52
gained. So this is like pre-usata. Yeah. So now you're getting off that then.

414
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:34.60
Man, nobody cares. Yeah. So they made it like they de-cute it. But that you don't get a belt from a

415
00:39:34.60 --> 00:39:41.000
DQ. So so again, it would be world champion. But is now just get to win over Tim Sylvia for

416
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.44
championship fight, but non champion. That sucks. Yeah. That's a bummer. The room was vicious and

417
00:39:46.44 --> 00:39:53.24
everybody hit hard. Everybody. How many times how often were you training? I train 14 times a week.

418
00:39:56.12 --> 00:40:02.12
You end up your first, your first fights for money. And this is such a click. This book is insane.

419
00:40:02.12 --> 00:40:07.72
Uh, your first fights for money are you get it? You do somebody a favor of driving some

420
00:40:07.72 --> 00:40:14.20
weapons down to normally in some kind of an event or something like this. And you're standing in

421
00:40:14.20 --> 00:40:19.16
the bar. And you see people getting kind of like taking a way, they look, the guys that look like you.

422
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:24.36
First of all. Uh-huh. Yeah. They do what, they explain it. Okay. So my buddy Gary Cobble.

423
00:40:24.36 --> 00:40:29.40
Um, he owns this weapons manufacturing company. And I'm driving the prototype weapons from

424
00:40:29.40 --> 00:40:34.60
Sandless Bispo. From past rural bulls all the way to New Orleans for trekspo east, which is like

425
00:40:34.60 --> 00:40:41.40
this law enforcement government convention. Think shot show or NRA, but just specific to law

426
00:40:41.40 --> 00:40:47.48
enforcement and military. So instead of doing the rational thing of, you know, stopping to get

427
00:40:47.48 --> 00:40:51.88
sleep, I get get rid of bottles, I'm pissing and get rid of bottles. And I drive straight through

428
00:40:51.88 --> 00:40:57.48
it like 90 miles an hour. So I can have extra time in New Orleans. Right. Of course. No doubt.

429
00:40:57.48 --> 00:41:04.28
This is like what you don't have to explain this. So I get there. I have a Lincoln Navigator with,

430
00:41:04.28 --> 00:41:08.12
you know, half a million dollars of experimental weapons in the back. And I park it on Burpens.

431
00:41:09.48 --> 00:41:14.04
And I go into the first bar I can find. And I'm like, this is also, and I see these dudes

432
00:41:14.04 --> 00:41:19.80
with chunked up ears, gigantic shoulders, you know, big like massive hands. And they're like bumping

433
00:41:19.80 --> 00:41:26.44
into little bros that are just hanging out in the bars. And then they walk out and somebody intervenes

434
00:41:26.44 --> 00:41:30.68
before they start fighting in the bar and just come down to my bar and I'll pay the winner of the

435
00:41:30.68 --> 00:41:35.08
two of you. Well, it was just a scam where the professional fighters were going and luring

436
00:41:35.08 --> 00:41:39.08
little traveling tourists that were drunk out of New Orleans to go fighting this bar.

437
00:41:40.44 --> 00:41:44.76
So this is brilliant. This is the best thing that could have happened to me. So I wait for the

438
00:41:44.76 --> 00:41:48.76
next bump, shoulder bump to happen. And I go over there and I bump into him and I was like,

439
00:41:48.76 --> 00:41:52.68
what's your problem? What's your, what's your, wait a second? What's going on here? I was like,

440
00:41:52.68 --> 00:41:58.76
I'm in. Let's go fly. So I became the new like asshole that then bring in the college kids to.

441
00:41:58.76 --> 00:42:03.64
And I'll just beat them and I get a couple hundred bucks per beating. And it was a great plan

442
00:42:03.64 --> 00:42:07.88
until I have to show up to work the next morning with swollen hands and black eyes from bare

443
00:42:07.88 --> 00:42:13.48
knuckle fights. Yeah. Good initiation though. I mean, you thought to yourself,

444
00:42:13.48 --> 00:42:20.44
hey, I can make money doing this. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard to, I'm you remember the early 2000s

445
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:27.80
MMA. MMA is not legal in probably 45 out of 50 states in California. I had, I would have to go to

446
00:42:27.80 --> 00:42:32.92
Indian reservations or I'd have to come down here and go to Tijuana. You know, I'd fight in

447
00:42:32.92 --> 00:42:37.08
literally every single Indian reservation up and down the state. I would have about 10 of them.

448
00:42:37.08 --> 00:42:42.36
And you know, the of the few states that would allow it, it was usually on Indian reservations in the

449
00:42:42.36 --> 00:42:47.56
state that it was kind of pseudo permitted. There was no athletic commission. There was no drug testing

450
00:42:47.56 --> 00:42:54.76
and you're getting paid in cash or a check that would probably bounce. That was, that was the

451
00:42:54.76 --> 00:42:59.32
MMA I grew up in for sure. Yeah. The the other wild thing is like, you don't know, you don't have

452
00:42:59.32 --> 00:43:05.40
any clue who your opponent is. No YouTube. Yeah. And you know, what how would you work with young

453
00:43:05.40 --> 00:43:09.000
fighters? You know, get these hyped up young fighters. They've been trained for two years like,

454
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.08
I want to fight. I want to do an amateur fight. I'm like, okay, but you don't know who your opponent's

455
00:43:13.08 --> 00:43:17.48
going to be. And I'd call out one of our guys that's like a black belt that wrestled in high school.

456
00:43:17.48 --> 00:43:22.84
I go, you know that guy upstairs? Yeah. You train with him? Yeah. I mean, he's got his first amateur

457
00:43:22.84 --> 00:43:26.68
fight in two weeks too. Like think about that. You know, think about you don't know who you're

458
00:43:26.68 --> 00:43:31.56
getting in with. Yeah. But luckily, you have got you are well rounded for the time for sure for the

459
00:43:31.56 --> 00:43:37.72
time. The pit was way advanced in the sense that, you know, we had brought up Glover Tickshare from

460
00:43:37.72 --> 00:43:43.88
Brazil. You had brilliant by John Hackelman to bring up. I would have to drive two hours to find

461
00:43:43.88 --> 00:43:49.32
a purple belt to train with in Jiu Jitsu. Two hours. Like it wasn't, there's a black belt on every

462
00:43:49.32 --> 00:43:56.84
corner. Yeah. Like it is now. You know, like in Austin, I think we have 160 black belts in the city of

463
00:43:56.84 --> 00:44:04.76
Austin. And I would drive two and a half hours to go to Santa Barbara to train with the closest purple

464
00:44:04.76 --> 00:44:12.36
belt. Who was it? I don't remember. No. Or I'd have to drive up to San Francisco to train with like the

465
00:44:13.56 --> 00:44:19.96
the, um, health graces. Yeah. There's my two options. Three hours north to the south.

466
00:44:19.96 --> 00:44:28.44
Rock Glover in. And now you got on tap. Yep. Bad asks. You did two guys. We have all the Cal Poly wrestling

467
00:44:28.44 --> 00:44:32.52
team. They would come in just to train with us just to work on a wrestling. Then we had Hawaiian

468
00:44:32.52 --> 00:44:37.40
Campo, John Hackelman teaching off our striking. You know, we had three K1 kickboxers that were there.

469
00:44:37.40 --> 00:44:41.64
So it was a very rare thing to have that. This, the pit was the first

470
00:44:43.56 --> 00:44:48.84
super fight club. It's like a glad theater school. Yeah. But now we, you know, we have American top team.

471
00:44:48.84 --> 00:44:53.24
You know, there's a bunch of them. You know, the aka, you know, you have Jackson Winkle John. The

472
00:44:53.24 --> 00:44:58.28
list goes on and all these great schools, um, and teams. But back then, they're weren't any. You

473
00:44:58.28 --> 00:45:03.48
know, like the T. Do Ortiz would come up from Huntington Beach and then Rande Couture and Matt

474
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:09.32
Lynn little come down from Oregon in Washington. You know, it's just, this was the spot. And I was just

475
00:45:09.32 --> 00:45:15.80
born there. Yeah. It's cool. These poor, freaking kids on the Indian reservation. It's exciting

476
00:45:15.80 --> 00:45:20.92
to fight your ass for the day. The funny thing is though, I've just think about this. You posted a

477
00:45:20.92 --> 00:45:28.76
picture while back of like you when you're just in the army. And, you know, you look young. You look

478
00:45:28.76 --> 00:45:33.48
young. Yeah. And so that's also going to throw people for a loop. They're looking at you like,

479
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:36.92
oh, who's this little guy? I want to beat his ass and I'm like, oh, no, this guy's been traded to

480
00:45:36.92 --> 00:45:46.28
pit. You know, you got another thing coming, boy. Yeah. That's awesome. Um, meanwhile, while all this

481
00:45:46.28 --> 00:45:51.40
is going on with this kind of like fight career, which, by the way, is also like a stretch. I mean,

482
00:45:51.40 --> 00:45:54.76
I guess you could look at the UFC at the time. Be like, well, yeah, maybe I could do that, but

483
00:45:54.76 --> 00:45:59.64
it seems like a stretch, you know, yeah, you're not going to make money on that time. Um, so you're

484
00:45:59.64 --> 00:46:07.40
trying to become a cop, which you're not old enough for. That's right. So therefore, in the meantime,

485
00:46:07.40 --> 00:46:11.96
I'm going to become a firefighter in order to become a firefighter. The, the, the, the first step on this

486
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:17.08
track many times is EMT. Yep. That's right. So you decide you're going to come, uh, become an EMT.

487
00:46:17.88 --> 00:46:24.52
Yep. That 18. I'm going to go to the book. As I step off the truck in my boots at the ground,

488
00:46:24.52 --> 00:46:29.56
I can already taste the dust, continuing the horror movie motive. The things that immediately

489
00:46:29.56 --> 00:46:36.44
catch my eyes are himnals being gently blown toward me across the ground. I can smell the burning

490
00:46:36.44 --> 00:46:42.12
fuel of the vehicle interlaced with the dust. I also smell the burning weeds near the van,

491
00:46:42.12 --> 00:46:49.32
and the accurate smell of blood, urine, and feces. And now here the wailing of people in pain

492
00:46:49.32 --> 00:46:54.68
seemingly coming from everywhere. I realize quickly several people have been thrown from the vehicle.

493
00:46:55.56 --> 00:47:04.20
The whales are not screams. When people are screaming, they have their facilities and are generally

494
00:47:04.20 --> 00:47:12.12
aware of the acute pain in injury. Whales are worse. They come from a deeper place inside a person.

495
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.52
They happen when one's body is so broken that it cannot muster a scream or even a full breath.

496
00:47:19.24 --> 00:47:26.60
And those whales and moans flood my senses freezing me where I stand. Again, I was just 19.

497
00:47:26.60 --> 00:47:35.40
I hear Tom finishing up the radio call. Send everyone. He says, the radio operator understands

498
00:47:35.40 --> 00:47:40.60
and confirms. Tom places the radio back in its proper place and he hops out of the truck.

499
00:47:40.60 --> 00:47:49.48
And as he strides past me, he says, pick one. That's something my teenage brain can understand.

500
00:47:49.48 --> 00:48:02.60
That's a rough one. There's a, basically a church van that crashes and you guys are first on scene.

501
00:48:02.60 --> 00:48:09.40
Driver Phyllis Sleep, stumped on the gas. They think they're rolled over at 85 miles an hour.

502
00:48:09.40 --> 00:48:16.36
Northbound on the 101. Crossed. Crossed. Where the center of the visor doesn't exist.

503
00:48:16.36 --> 00:48:22.04
Rolled. Launching, you know, you're in a van. Church van's, you're not buckled up. Nobody was buckled up.

504
00:48:22.04 --> 00:48:29.64
And all it did was launch bodies across this rural landscape on the side of this hill.

505
00:48:31.08 --> 00:48:39.56
And you know, I just turned 19. I'd been with the fire department for five months. I had graduated

506
00:48:39.56 --> 00:48:46.92
from EMT School at Quest of College six months before that. Like I knew nothing. You know,

507
00:48:46.92 --> 00:48:54.20
I knew how to take vitals. I knew how to like treat bleeding wounds. And I, and my only experience

508
00:48:54.20 --> 00:48:59.72
in trauma had been, you know, a couple of people self-inflicted, you know, mental health type things.

509
00:48:59.72 --> 00:49:08.68
So this was on a scale of something I never seen and trauma that I'd never seen before. And it was

510
00:49:09.64 --> 00:49:20.20
that I know what to do. It was a child. 14 people were in the crash. And again, you, you describe

511
00:49:20.20 --> 00:49:27.32
everything with some awesome detail in the book. But all but one had critical kind of life threatening

512
00:49:27.32 --> 00:49:36.52
injuries. And out of those 14, seven were, or actually able to survive because the work of you

513
00:49:36.52 --> 00:49:42.20
and the team. And you give a lot of credit to the team. As you're saying right now, you were

514
00:49:42.20 --> 00:49:45.48
young, just kind of falling direction, trying to, trying to put together what you could.

515
00:49:45.48 --> 00:49:51.72
But a guy named Tom Wei Anthony, Stormetta, and Keith Axon, just more experience guys that

516
00:49:51.72 --> 00:49:56.92
could make things happen. And the kind of guys that you looked at and you said to yourself, all right,

517
00:49:56.92 --> 00:50:02.04
that's a good role model for me to try and emulate. Yeah, you know when you've seen this,

518
00:50:02.04 --> 00:50:09.16
chaos screams fire, blood pain. There's always somebody that's cool, right? There's somebody that's

519
00:50:09.16 --> 00:50:17.32
always just like, all right, this is what we're going to do. And that just, I didn't have that

520
00:50:17.32 --> 00:50:27.56
and I wanted that. And there's not a linear path to become that. And the frustration of standing

521
00:50:27.56 --> 00:50:34.20
over body. And again, in this triage sense, the first body I run to, I start working on and Tom

522
00:50:34.20 --> 00:50:39.80
Wei just walks up and as I came in, go find somebody else. And then I watch Tom not start working

523
00:50:39.80 --> 00:50:45.80
on that body. But this does not compute, right? Then like the neuros in my brain are like,

524
00:50:45.80 --> 00:50:51.48
why is he not treating this person that he just told, oh, they're going to die. Got it. So

525
00:50:51.48 --> 00:50:57.000
go to the next one, I start, it was a child and I start working on the child and Tom comes over and

526
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.60
he's like, hey, go find another one. And like that was just a knife, like this hot,

527
00:51:02.60 --> 00:51:08.28
searing poker straight through my chest of like, oh my God, this little girl is going to die.

528
00:51:08.92 --> 00:51:14.44
And then I see Tom start working on her. I'm like, okay, she's got a chance, you know?

529
00:51:14.44 --> 00:51:20.12
But now what do I do? Right? I just took a pick-toe for two, you know, like, apparently I'm not

530
00:51:20.12 --> 00:51:27.48
picking the right ones. So go off to the next one, start figuring out. There's still three of us.

531
00:51:27.48 --> 00:51:35.24
There's 15, 14 bodies and there's three of us on the ground. Then help another truck rolls up,

532
00:51:35.24 --> 00:51:42.20
then the ambulance rolls up. Now we have like seven people that are there to work. We still have

533
00:51:42.20 --> 00:51:49.32
14 bodies. We still don't have enough hands. So it is, I mean, I describe it nightmarish.

534
00:51:50.28 --> 00:51:55.96
And there's no way besides in like a horror film to depict what it feels like to be, to be hearing

535
00:51:55.96 --> 00:52:01.80
those sounds, to be smelling all of those smells, to be seen this just carnage, you know, with the fire

536
00:52:01.80 --> 00:52:08.60
truck lights and the dust that's still settling, you know, in the California dry environment that we live in,

537
00:52:08.60 --> 00:52:15.96
it's, you know, it's wild. Shapes, shape somebody though. Yeah, again, for me, just you,

538
00:52:15.96 --> 00:52:22.12
even being able to identify, hey, these guys, Tom way, the way he was just acting, that's the way I

539
00:52:22.12 --> 00:52:26.28
should be acting. That's what I need to figure out. And like you said, it's not going to happen overnight,

540
00:52:26.28 --> 00:52:30.36
but at least you have some kind of a goal and you see a good example. Yeah, there's just a

541
00:52:30.36 --> 00:52:37.88
dude Dave Payton, the another example, Big House Fire, I'm running off to go do like firemen things,

542
00:52:37.88 --> 00:52:43.08
you know, and Dave like grabs me by the scuff of the neck and's like, that's not going to do anything,

543
00:52:43.08 --> 00:52:49.64
hold on a second. He sets up the truck, gets water pressure, and then he's like, go, you know,

544
00:52:49.64 --> 00:52:56.36
there's, there's, there's so cool to have people like that that that we're able to shape

545
00:52:56.36 --> 00:53:02.44
young men and be able to like, you know, save this one for example. So speaking of firefighting,

546
00:53:02.44 --> 00:53:11.000
you end up becoming a firefighter. Yep. And it's an interesting, you can't look at you like,

547
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.12
you look at the guy, this guy, I remember guy like this, I kicked him off to you. Oh man,

548
00:53:17.88 --> 00:53:23.80
you got, well, what's a bummer for me is like you had a fire chief that wasn't a great guy.

549
00:53:23.80 --> 00:53:28.92
And what's a bummer for me is just like any, like like what you just said, you get your freaking

550
00:53:28.92 --> 00:53:35.72
dog, right, you're an attack dog. And without a good like leader, you're just going to bite the first

551
00:53:35.72 --> 00:53:41.000
breath freaking thing that you see. But when someone's when you've got a good guidance and good

552
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.64
leadership, you're going to get pointed in the right direction. You're going to be awesome. And you know,

553
00:53:45.64 --> 00:53:54.76
your first fire chief didn't, wasn't that kind of guy. And so you do things that in some respects

554
00:53:54.76 --> 00:54:00.84
are awesome. And what exactly what you would want for your young firefighters to be like and

555
00:54:00.84 --> 00:54:04.92
to think like, they just need a little bit extra guidance. They just need to, oh, yeah, you know what,

556
00:54:04.92 --> 00:54:10.04
I got a freaking eye on Kennedy right now. Let's make sure we got the leash hold on hold on. All right,

557
00:54:10.04 --> 00:54:15.88
now go. You know, that's exactly what you needed in. And but you end up getting in trouble for a lot of

558
00:54:15.88 --> 00:54:20.36
this shit again. Some of it's you're doing dumb shit, but you're doing dumb shit because it's not

559
00:54:20.36 --> 00:54:26.28
like you were being neglectful. You're actually doing dumb shit that was aggressive and heroic to try and

560
00:54:26.28 --> 00:54:32.68
help. Just sometimes you could lead a little extra guidance. The guy had a three strike rule.

561
00:54:32.68 --> 00:54:40.04
Yeah. And you write about the strikes. Yeah. The first one, there's like a female cop who's

562
00:54:40.76 --> 00:54:44.60
what? There's like a suicidal guy in an apartment. It's right by your apartment. Yeah.

563
00:54:44.60 --> 00:54:51.40
It's a Bordo apartment complexes. If you know a tasketero, it's good. Sketch. And like, you know,

564
00:54:51.40 --> 00:54:57.24
like, we have these little pages and like, beep, beep, beep, tasketero fire. And then you'd get

565
00:54:57.24 --> 00:55:02.44
the address and what type of call it was. The address pops on. I was like, do that's like six doors down.

566
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.92
I can do this. So I walk out there and this young police officer, she's standing out in front of the door.

567
00:55:08.92 --> 00:55:15.16
I'm fighting. I've been a professional athlete at this point. You know, I've 50 something amateur

568
00:55:15.16 --> 00:55:21.56
fights. I have a handful of of pro fights now. And she is dealing with a dude trying to kill

569
00:55:21.56 --> 00:55:28.52
himself and he has like a box cutter. And he's cutting his wrists. And the mom had called 911.

570
00:55:28.52 --> 00:55:34.76
And she's waiting for backup. And she can't go in by herself. And, and I look in there and it is,

571
00:55:34.76 --> 00:55:41.56
it is just like a child. You know, it's a 19-year-old frail. You know, mental health, it is such a

572
00:55:41.56 --> 00:55:49.000
problem right now. But you very often see not physical specimens that are struggling with these

573
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.32
problems. So when I peek my head in there, I was like, all right, you know, this is, I got this.

574
00:55:53.32 --> 00:55:57.88
I got this. This is not a problem. Are you going to go in? They got me going. I'm going with you.

575
00:55:57.88 --> 00:56:02.92
And firefighters should not do that. They should wait until it's safe. And then they should go in.

576
00:56:02.92 --> 00:56:07.48
They're the, they're the, the second responders, not the first responders. And then I got trouble.

577
00:56:08.20 --> 00:56:11.32
That was strike one. That was strike one. By the way, you went to the fire academy. You're a number

578
00:56:11.32 --> 00:56:17.08
one graduate of the fire academy. That's right. So again, to me, that reflects someone that when you

579
00:56:17.08 --> 00:56:20.44
given the parameters of what they're supposed to do, they're going to knock it out of the park.

580
00:56:20.44 --> 00:56:24.20
Yeah. You know, and you just kind of make sure those parameters are in place.

581
00:56:24.20 --> 00:56:29.64
Test condition. Yeah. Let's keep this mother fucker in the box a little bit. Here's your last

582
00:56:29.64 --> 00:56:37.000
second one. There's a car crash and it's in ravine and they're waiting to set up the rig to

583
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.76
repel down into the ravine. You're like, I got this. It was on the in between a task at our

584
00:56:42.76 --> 00:56:48.92
and Mara Bay, California. It was a highway 41. And there's a big huge drop off that goes down

585
00:56:48.92 --> 00:56:55.000
into the creek. Big huge. Like, it's not. You know, I got, that's my backyard where I grew up.

586
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.76
So this, the motorcycle, it's such a fun road to ride motorcycles on. I go there all the, like,

587
00:57:00.76 --> 00:57:08.12
a grew up riding my, my, my was the CFR 250 up this road. And so I know exactly what this guy was

588
00:57:08.12 --> 00:57:13.16
doing. An oncoming car sees this motorcycle swirves to avoid it and goes off into the ravine.

589
00:57:14.28 --> 00:57:19.48
They, they tumble down the hill when we get there. They're down at the bottom. And, and the door

590
00:57:19.48 --> 00:57:24.60
kind of like, I can see blood coming out the side of the door and the door is kind of a jar and I see

591
00:57:24.60 --> 00:57:28.76
this woman like messing with her leg and the other guy is tore up on the other side. So like,

592
00:57:28.76 --> 00:57:33.88
I go grab a tool when I just walked down the hill, pop the door open and I start treating this girl.

593
00:57:33.88 --> 00:57:40.28
It was not not even an event in my brain. All the while, the rest of the team was setting up

594
00:57:40.28 --> 00:57:48.12
to do a high and go rescue. So I got a trouble for that. Yeah. So you got a trouble because you didn't

595
00:57:48.12 --> 00:57:53.56
follow the protocol or something like that. Yeah. So this, this was strike two. Strike three,

596
00:57:53.56 --> 00:58:00.84
it sounded like you deserved a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure we're in a studio right now.

597
00:58:00.84 --> 00:58:07.96
You know, in fires do weird things and studios make fires do even weird things. There's no

598
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:14.20
where for heat to escape. Got a bunch of electrical equipment. And in that fire, there was a

599
00:58:14.20 --> 00:58:20.28
studio in there. And the inversion layer, so like the smoke and the heat was so thick that you can see

600
00:58:20.28 --> 00:58:25.48
where the fire was. And as you know, you go up inches, you'd start going up hundreds of degrees.

601
00:58:25.48 --> 00:58:31.08
You go up feet and you're talking like a thousand degrees in difference. And I was trying to find

602
00:58:31.08 --> 00:58:35.72
the fire, which is like what a nozzle guy is supposed to do. I didn't have the experience to

603
00:58:35.72 --> 00:58:42.12
understand or realize how dangerous it was. So in like the little particles in the air just started

604
00:58:42.12 --> 00:58:46.84
combusting as the temperature of the room started reaching a flash point. Like an experienced person

605
00:58:46.84 --> 00:58:51.40
is going to be like, oh, this is about to go down. Yeah. Like instead, I'm like, no, no,

606
00:58:51.40 --> 00:58:55.64
let's find the fire. Like you're in the fire, bro. Like the fire is above you. You just can't see it.

607
00:58:55.64 --> 00:59:00.04
You know, if you in the top of your helmet, that popping sound is your helmet melting. You're just too

608
00:59:00.04 --> 00:59:05.48
dumb to know it. So in the fire, when the room fire finally flashes, like if you see the movie

609
00:59:05.48 --> 00:59:10.60
back drop, the back drop, where the room finally just goes, oh, that's what happens. I just crank

610
00:59:10.60 --> 00:59:15.96
up in the nozzle, put it on flood and why to try to not get us to burn alive in an effort to

611
00:59:17.88 --> 00:59:22.92
which was the right thing for us not to die, but also, you know, not great thing for a lot of

612
00:59:22.92 --> 00:59:31.40
steam. Who steamsucks. Got it. So I burnt me in an Allen linear, the dude behind me on the nozzle

613
00:59:31.40 --> 00:59:36.76
being like, hey, you're being stupid. What are they? Was he trying to pull you back? Yeah,

614
00:59:36.76 --> 00:59:46.36
I think so. I think that's what it's loud fire, nozzle water, and me pulling him forward and

615
00:59:46.36 --> 00:59:50.44
being that dog, being that bull. You know, like, no, let's go find the fire, let's find the fire,

616
00:59:50.44 --> 00:59:55.72
I think him being behind me and being that second set of eyes. Like, that the pulling back was

617
00:59:55.72 --> 01:00:00.28
literally him saying, no, no, no, no, we have reached our limited advance. We need to back up.

618
01:00:00.28 --> 01:00:07.80
Um, but I was just too dumb and too stubborn. Yeah, it sounded like pretty sketchy. You roll

619
01:00:07.80 --> 01:00:13.80
out of there and your helmets like melted and your mask is all jacked up. Yeah, so we have

620
01:00:13.80 --> 01:00:19.08
these self-contained breathing apparatus and you have a layer of plastic glass, plastic glass.

621
01:00:19.08 --> 01:00:25.96
So plastic and melted, glass had shattered, plastic and melted and I had one layer of glass in

622
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:33.24
front of my face. Um, and my, the top of my helmet with my firefighter number 42, I still have

623
01:00:33.24 --> 01:00:38.04
my firefighter number on my desk, which is like burnt and charred and I keep it there to remind me

624
01:00:38.76 --> 01:00:46.12
how dumb I have that helmet. Um, that melted. The top of it was like all bubbled and boiled

625
01:00:47.16 --> 01:00:53.16
to weird. You don't want to see a helmet like that. And that ended up being a strike three. That's

626
01:00:53.16 --> 01:01:00.92
right. So you could kick off the fire department, which in your mind, um, unstoppable Tim Kennedy's

627
01:01:00.92 --> 01:01:05.000
like good because I wanted to be a cop anyways. Yeah. Right. That was kind of, that was kind of what you're

628
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.20
doing. Uh, meanwhile, your, your, your fight careers going. Mm-hmm. What year is this now? This is, uh,

629
01:01:12.20 --> 01:01:19.000
2000. Um, you lost your first profile. Scott Smith. That's embarrassing.

630
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:27.48
Um, and, uh, arrogance. I bought him five weeks before that and like smacked him. Uh-huh.

631
01:01:27.48 --> 01:01:32.76
And so I walk into my pro debut and, uh, how did, how did you beat him? How did he beat you?

632
01:01:32.76 --> 01:01:38.76
Um, he beat me TKO stoppage. Big huge cut doctors like I can see your cheekbone. Get out.

633
01:01:39.80 --> 01:01:46.84
How did you beat him? Three rounds of domination. Domination. What do you catch? You just caught

634
01:01:46.84 --> 01:01:52.28
you? Yeah. You just weren't used clear. I mean, he got he got 15 minutes of of first person

635
01:01:52.28 --> 01:01:57.32
preparation. And I did exactly the same thing that I did in the first round and the first moment

636
01:01:57.32 --> 01:02:01.16
of our first fight where I had a big change of level. I was going to push him up against the cage.

637
01:02:01.16 --> 01:02:05.16
You know, make it dirty for a second. So that change of level. He just blew me open with an

638
01:02:05.16 --> 01:02:10.92
upper cut. Check. Yeah. I can't. Like literally the exact same thing that I was like,

639
01:02:10.92 --> 01:02:15.08
ah, I'm going to do the same thing I did to him last time. And he's like, I'm going to do a

640
01:02:15.08 --> 01:02:19.88
different thing. I didn't know how I was going to do it. And it worked out. How long? When did the

641
01:02:19.88 --> 01:02:24.68
fight get stopped after the first round or? Oh, no, no, like, immediately. Yeah. We're two minute,

642
01:02:24.68 --> 01:02:32.92
minute and a half into the first round. Oh, yeah. Walking into the pit as a zero one fighter.

643
01:02:33.80 --> 01:02:39.56
Walking into again and chuck and Scott and Eric and John Hackelman. I already felt like I didn't

644
01:02:39.56 --> 01:02:49.72
belong. And I'm walking as an Owen one pro. Lusier. Lusier. You do. It's like it's so crazy to think,

645
01:02:49.72 --> 01:02:54.20
you know, even walking into that place, you're by no means, yeah, they're just walking that

646
01:02:54.20 --> 01:02:58.92
place and training you're sparring with chocolate out like you're about your badass. And yet you

647
01:02:58.92 --> 01:03:06.92
get feet, you feel like a loser. You're losing. But you are moving up like moving up the respect

648
01:03:06.92 --> 01:03:15.40
ranks at the pit. And you're you end up going to some of trucks, one of trucks fights,

649
01:03:15.40 --> 01:03:21.24
championship fight against Booster Monte. I was chuckling this whole time, you know, anyone.

650
01:03:21.24 --> 01:03:25.32
I don't know what it's like. Maybe it's gotten better. But back in the day, if you were like a teammate,

651
01:03:26.20 --> 01:03:31.000
you were like, go to pay your own way to get up there. You're going to sleep with six other guys.

652
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.96
Yeah. You know, in the same room, you weren't going to get fed anything. You're cutting weight with your

653
01:03:35.96 --> 01:03:41.88
fighter. It's just like sucked. Sleeping on the hotel room floor, getting beat up. By the way,

654
01:03:41.88 --> 01:03:44.84
you can't win any of your sparring. You're just getting beat up. You're just getting punched in the

655
01:03:44.84 --> 01:03:52.04
head. Just to back up what I put us to to punch. There's no, there's like no glory in being a second

656
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:57.48
or a third or a fourth, which is basically what it seemed like. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're like

657
01:03:57.48 --> 01:04:03.64
body getting here. Yeah. When Eric or Gann are, you know, Scott retired or bored that just thrown

658
01:04:03.64 --> 01:04:10.12
me. So I don't even think I was like fourth string. I was not even acknowledged at being present.

659
01:04:10.12 --> 01:04:13.08
Did you get a ticket to the fight? Because I was not thinking there was no guarantee you're getting

660
01:04:13.08 --> 01:04:17.80
to the fight. I didn't get a ticket to like the first three fights I had. And I finally got to,

661
01:04:17.80 --> 01:04:25.40
I think veto bell fort was the first fight that I physically got to be in the arena for. It was so cool.

662
01:04:25.40 --> 01:04:30.36
Yeah. Like, we used to run every kind of scam to get into those fights. We, I would go,

663
01:04:30.36 --> 01:04:34.36
I would get in every single time 100% of the time. And we were running all kinds of, you know,

664
01:04:34.36 --> 01:04:39.96
tactical operations. And I love the best seats. I have the sickest seats. I've seen so I've seen

665
01:04:39.96 --> 01:04:47.72
so many UFC's from like road three that I had no tickets to. We did all kinds of tactical maneuvers

666
01:04:47.72 --> 01:04:51.64
to get into those fights. Because that's the crazy thing. Right? You go up there. You'd be cornering

667
01:04:51.64 --> 01:04:56.60
someone. I would literally be cornering someone and not have a ticket to the fight. But I think

668
01:04:56.60 --> 01:05:01.56
I'm going to come out of Marty's back. Yeah. This is let me in. The security would walk up and

669
01:05:01.56 --> 01:05:06.84
be like nine of us in front of four seats. Do you guys have tickets? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

670
01:05:06.84 --> 01:05:11.48
Like, this is our ticket. And they're like, that was his ticket. No, no, no. This is my ticket.

671
01:05:11.48 --> 01:05:15.96
Well, where his ticket? I don't know. I'm going to get a beer. I'll be back. Yeah. Cool.

672
01:05:17.16 --> 01:05:24.92
You ended up becoming the extreme challenge champion. And in this, are you starting to think

673
01:05:24.92 --> 01:05:29.08
maybe this is a thing? Like, when you go up with Chalker, you start to know still don't think. No.

674
01:05:29.08 --> 01:05:33.56
Still don't think it's like an actual. I still like fighting. Yeah. And that tournament that

675
01:05:33.56 --> 01:05:38.04
eight man tournament. That was the who's who of middle weights at the time. You've Jason Manham Miller,

676
01:05:38.04 --> 01:05:45.56
Dennis King, Ryan Norte, me, like, for early 2000s when you put, like, these are the eight best

677
01:05:45.56 --> 01:05:49.08
students of the planet. Those are those that's that's that's the money right there. And that's a

678
01:05:49.08 --> 01:05:55.16
tough, freaking tournament. Yeah. And I think I, I think I won enough to pay for a computer for my next

679
01:05:55.16 --> 01:06:02.44
semester in school. You know, there's no money. Chuck paid for my pizza kitchen post-fight meal,

680
01:06:02.44 --> 01:06:08.36
Chuck paid for my YMCA to go in to cut weight in the sauna. It was the only sauna we could find

681
01:06:08.36 --> 01:06:14.36
in Salt Lake City. Like Chuck out of pocket. Like, there was no money. And I'm like the ECC champion.

682
01:06:14.36 --> 01:06:18.68
Yeah. So yeah, those are the good old days. Yeah. No, no one was fighting for the money back

683
01:06:18.68 --> 01:06:26.44
down. We just fought. I just wanted to fight. Uh, you fight and win in the WEC as well. Was that

684
01:06:26.44 --> 01:06:31.32
any better? Was there anything at the WEC? I got a hundred bucks to show and a hundred bucks to win

685
01:06:32.84 --> 01:06:37.96
to fight that as a heavyweight. You fought as heavyweight? Oh, is that 194 pounds?

686
01:06:38.52 --> 01:06:44.68
And I fought as heavyweight. You're kind of getting, you, this is kind of, you're getting like a

687
01:06:44.68 --> 01:06:49.24
minor level of fame, though, at this point. What do you say? Yeah, like the MMA weeklies are starting

688
01:06:49.24 --> 01:06:55.000
to write, you know, the up and come or, you know, on the top 10 rankings, I'm like,

689
01:06:56.20 --> 01:07:04.76
measurable, no mentioned. Like, notably mentioned type categories. So who is this guy type questions?

690
01:07:05.56 --> 01:07:11.000
But the WEC was nothing to sneeze at back in the day. You know, like I remember it was like

691
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.68
kind of on the same level. Like UFC was obviously the bigger promotion, but, you know, some

692
01:07:16.68 --> 01:07:22.84
incredible fighters came out of the 20 C. I mean, it was a great, great place to be at that stage.

693
01:07:22.84 --> 01:07:30.76
Yeah, WEC was totally legit. Yeah. Um, you got, you, you, you, you, you, you're getting wrapped into the

694
01:07:30.76 --> 01:07:36.68
whole fighter kind of thing. Yeah, I'm starting to live in the booze, they're everything else.

695
01:07:36.68 --> 01:07:43.40
Not, not the booze as much, but the women, the traveling, the fighting, I mean, it is, it's a,

696
01:07:43.40 --> 01:07:48.28
it's a, it's a real unhealthy lifestyle when you're like committed to it. You know, you've

697
01:07:48.28 --> 01:07:54.36
you've waked up, you'd fight, you know, you'd wake up, you'd rinse off whatever debotry is on you,

698
01:07:54.92 --> 01:07:59.48
and then the seat don't care those diseases into the gym, and then you'd go in train, and then

699
01:07:59.48 --> 01:08:05.56
you're trying to do some form of recovery and get some type of food, and then debotry training again,

700
01:08:05.56 --> 01:08:11.64
and then debotry, like that's about your day. So that's, so you, you see, you're rolling, rolling in the

701
01:08:11.64 --> 01:08:17.40
roll of deep, and that what a weird, it was a weird time, too, because it was like, the fighters

702
01:08:17.40 --> 01:08:22.44
weren't really getting paid much money, but you kind of had recognition, and like people that were

703
01:08:22.44 --> 01:08:28.52
kind of fanboys, like club owners would be all hyped to bring everyone in and set up tables and

704
01:08:28.52 --> 01:08:33.40
one of them. Yeah, you'd get like bottle service because you were the fighter, and the guys, the,

705
01:08:33.40 --> 01:08:38.92
the bars wanted you in there because it made them seem more famous because they had like the

706
01:08:38.92 --> 01:08:43.32
tough guys in their gyms or in their bars, but we still didn't have enough money to even buy the

707
01:08:43.32 --> 01:08:47.56
bottles, it's like, is this bottle, or are we gonna have a baby? It's like we didn't know how it's always

708
01:08:47.56 --> 01:08:53.16
working out. Yeah, it was a really, in the like the ring girls, they weren't like real ring girls,

709
01:08:53.16 --> 01:08:59.96
they're just kind of like local girls that were getting paid. It was a wild, wild circus. Yeah,

710
01:08:59.96 --> 01:09:09.24
it was a wild, wild, interesting time, I was for sure. You know, I like, you just talked about

711
01:09:09.24 --> 01:09:15.56
bottle, like I remember being at like things, at like post, fight parties and stuff like this,

712
01:09:15.56 --> 01:09:19.24
and there's like bottle service and people are ordering bottles, and I'm like, I have, I'm in the

713
01:09:19.24 --> 01:09:24.84
navy bottle, I've been in navy, I got three, two or three kids, but I'm not paying for shit,

714
01:09:24.84 --> 01:09:30.68
like you can fuck and get out of here, run that pain for a $400 bottle of some shit, I don't even know what

715
01:09:30.68 --> 01:09:35.08
it is, it's not happening, and I'd just be like, you know, I'll drink some of this, but like,

716
01:09:35.08 --> 01:09:39.64
you're getting no money for me, you're worse like whoever whatever fighter I'm with is like,

717
01:09:39.64 --> 01:09:43.40
I'm not paying for anything either, so we don't know who's paying for this stuff, but somebody's

718
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:49.16
getting stuck with the bill and it could be us. Those are some wild times. It's hard. There's no way

719
01:09:49.16 --> 01:09:54.84
people that are looking at, you know, even after pride, that UFC proper now, where that, you know,

720
01:09:54.84 --> 01:09:59.80
they see guys and suits and doing proper way and's athletic commissions, and, you know, US, the

721
01:09:59.80 --> 01:10:06.76
anti-doping coming in, when we're talking back then, the wild west of everything, like warm-up rooms

722
01:10:06.76 --> 01:10:11.88
that were, there's literally like, I remember being intense, there's the ground is just tar,

723
01:10:11.88 --> 01:10:15.96
it's just a parking lot, it's like, oh, we're gonna, yeah, you guys can warm up right over there,

724
01:10:15.96 --> 01:10:21.72
it's tar, it's a fucking parking lot, you're like, what, okay, races to the banks afterwards

725
01:10:21.72 --> 01:10:25.80
to try to cash your check, it's only the first five checks we're clear, there's probably,

726
01:10:25.80 --> 01:10:31.24
I would say a dozen fights that we had to fight our way out of, like, out of the audience,

727
01:10:31.24 --> 01:10:35.56
like, if you vote, beat a local, you would have to fight your way out of it and try to not get

728
01:10:35.56 --> 01:10:39.72
stabbed, and if you haven't forbid you fought an Indian on an Indian reservation, and you beat that

729
01:10:39.72 --> 01:10:46.52
Indian, like, you, dude, it is, it's hard, it's every due guys are open, you're chucks leading the way,

730
01:10:46.52 --> 01:10:50.20
Gans drop an L-Bows is we're bustin' through and we're just trying not to get stuck,

731
01:10:50.92 --> 01:10:59.08
like, this is that era of MMA. Meanwhile, all that's going on, you're trying to become a police officer,

732
01:10:59.08 --> 01:11:03.56
yep, right? Yep, that's your, that's your goal, which is a smart goal because you realize,

733
01:11:03.56 --> 01:11:10.44
you know, there's no money in fighting, you go to the academy, you're the honor graduate of the academy.

734
01:11:10.44 --> 01:11:16.76
No, runner up, oh, you were runner up, oh, huh, oh, did I read that wrong? Yeah, so I have highest GPA,

735
01:11:16.76 --> 01:11:23.24
I have highest score, like highest physical score, I have like highest everything, I get in a fight

736
01:11:24.04 --> 01:11:30.68
with one of the instructors over report writing, and oh, that's right, I tell him how he should

737
01:11:30.68 --> 01:11:36.04
do report writing, and like this is a better way with more with a clear narrative, and he didn't say,

738
01:11:36.04 --> 01:11:41.08
wow, cadet, thank you so much for your input, that's incredible, you know, because we did not say that.

739
01:11:42.68 --> 01:11:46.92
And I stuck to my guns, I was like, no, this is the other course, bro, you're right, I am right.

740
01:11:46.92 --> 01:11:51.88
How can he know? So he, he failed me and you can't be on our graduate with a failure. That's right, that's right.

741
01:11:51.88 --> 01:11:57.32
So then I retake the test and I do it exactly how he wants and I get my passing grade of 71%

742
01:11:57.32 --> 01:12:04.20
or 70% and even though like my first one was perfect and it should have been 100% so you cannot

743
01:12:04.20 --> 01:12:09.32
graduate if you fail a test, you can't be on our graduate as a failure. So I have my

744
01:12:10.60 --> 01:12:18.04
astrix and I'm number two, number one, but number two gets on our graduate. Yep, and you had a good

745
01:12:18.04 --> 01:12:23.80
story in there about, you know, the combatives course that they taught you were once again, they're

746
01:12:23.80 --> 01:12:28.68
looking like, oh, who's this little youngster that's in here? Oh, you think you're tough?

747
01:12:28.68 --> 01:12:34.52
Oh, watch this and you're like, no, watch this. Do you, tell me if I'm wrong,

748
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:39.80
jujitsu is a superpower. Jujitsu is a superpower. Yes, it's a superpower. And when, if I'm in a room

749
01:12:39.80 --> 01:12:44.52
with a bunch of cadets and I say, you cannot put cuffs on me unless I let you put cuffs on me and

750
01:12:44.52 --> 01:12:52.76
you got like, there's 40 of us, I don't care. That is how powerful jujitsu is when you empower somebody

751
01:12:52.76 --> 01:12:57.24
with that type of skill and knowledge. If I can take my hands and put my hands on a grown person

752
01:12:57.24 --> 01:13:03.40
and they can do anything that I want them to, like that's the power of jujitsu. And they did not have

753
01:13:03.40 --> 01:13:10.20
that power, but they needed to know it. So again, here's so stupid, Tim, I'm like, okay, well, I will

754
01:13:10.20 --> 01:13:17.48
teach you guys that. This is how better, you know, so arrogant, so pathetic, but you guys can't do

755
01:13:17.48 --> 01:13:27.24
nothing to me. That's what it was. It's true though, man. It's hard. It's hard when you, when someone

756
01:13:27.24 --> 01:13:32.92
knows how to fight, it is really hard to get control of them. It is really hard to get control of them.

757
01:13:32.92 --> 01:13:37.08
And especially the other people don't really know how to fight. You know, if they learn

758
01:13:37.08 --> 01:13:42.68
whatever, for step procedure for getting control, you know, like no, that procedure is not going to

759
01:13:42.68 --> 01:13:49.40
work for a millisecond against me. Go away. Yeah. I, you know, I beg and I plead law enforcement

760
01:13:49.40 --> 01:13:54.12
to go and do jujitsu. You know, if they're 10, they're 10 police officers that are

761
01:13:55.32 --> 01:13:59.32
police academy trained, they do their cuffing, they're defensive tactics. And they say,

762
01:13:59.32 --> 01:14:07.24
Jaco, you're under arrest. I'm going to put cuffs on you. Zero chance. All 10 grown adults

763
01:14:07.24 --> 01:14:13.32
trying to cuff you zero chance. You know, but then you take one that trains. Totally different.

764
01:14:13.32 --> 01:14:17.96
Totally different story. Yeah. And it's gotten really bad now. I'm not to derail this conversation,

765
01:14:17.96 --> 01:14:25.000
but I was just talking to a couple police officers. And I won't mention the state where they are,

766
01:14:25.24 --> 01:14:28.68
if they put a choke hold on someone, if they put a rear naked choke on someone,

767
01:14:28.68 --> 01:14:37.40
lethal force, they, they, I'm trying to think of the steps. It's like a full, it's a full on like

768
01:14:37.40 --> 01:14:45.08
felony first degree murder. If, if the person dies, yeah, it's, but even if the person doesn't,

769
01:14:45.08 --> 01:14:49.08
if you just do it, it's like a, it's like a assault with a deadly weapon or something like this.

770
01:14:49.72 --> 01:14:54.12
And it's so hard to explain to people. I don't know. I don't know what you think, but

771
01:14:54.12 --> 01:15:01.80
if I had to subdue someone that I cared about, the number one thing I would do is put a rear

772
01:15:01.80 --> 01:15:06.92
naked choke on that choke. It's so safe. It's the gentlest nicest way to get someone under control.

773
01:15:06.92 --> 01:15:12.92
Yeah. And it's so effective. And there's nothing, you know, like, it leaves no marks. I can't.

774
01:15:12.92 --> 01:15:16.52
You know, you could choke me right now and I'd wake up and be like, oh, dude, you know,

775
01:15:16.52 --> 01:15:19.48
you could have cuffs on me and I'd be like, oh, what just happened? And I'd be totally fine.

776
01:15:19.48 --> 01:15:23.32
Yeah. You could uncaf me and I could go and freaking teach it class in whatever.

777
01:15:23.32 --> 01:15:29.24
And carry on with my debt. As opposed to you hitting me in the, in the head 19 times with a baton to get to subdue me.

778
01:15:29.24 --> 01:15:36.12
We're at our spare. Amazing. All those things are so hard. And we, like, people just have no

779
01:15:36.12 --> 01:15:43.24
understanding of the power of jujitsu and the power of the rear naked choke. It's, it's, it's so sad.

780
01:15:43.24 --> 01:15:48.52
And so many more people are going to get hurt because of it. Yeah. And all that takes is if you're

781
01:15:48.52 --> 01:15:52.20
in law enforcement or if you're in charge of law enforcement, mandate,

782
01:15:52.20 --> 01:15:55.64
everyone should be trained in jujitsu. Yeah. You should be trained in jujitsu all the time.

783
01:15:57.24 --> 01:16:02.68
I've been saying 20% of what police do, 20% of the time should be trained. Yeah.

784
01:16:02.68 --> 01:16:07.000
And not only shapes the body, but also shapes the mind. It does such a beautiful thing to ego.

785
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.56
It deters things back and it makes you human. And when you're in a position of power like that,

786
01:16:13.56 --> 01:16:18.92
you have to have your ego checked. And the best way to do it is to put you on a mat and have you lose.

787
01:16:18.92 --> 01:16:23.88
Back to those people that have never been hit in the face, the city councils that enact those

788
01:16:23.88 --> 01:16:28.52
type policies for their cities. Those are the people that have never been in a fight that have never

789
01:16:28.52 --> 01:16:31.80
gone on a ride along that have never been punched in the face, but they're like, do it. This

790
01:16:31.80 --> 01:16:36.36
police officer can't do it to a choke or you don't know anything about anything. And you're the one

791
01:16:36.36 --> 01:16:41.40
that's mandating and your ignorance is causing more damage to your community because you don't

792
01:16:41.40 --> 01:16:45.72
understand. You don't understand violence because you've never been in it. But like as men that are

793
01:16:45.72 --> 01:16:50.28
pretty intimately familiar with violence, listen to the city council people, go get punched on the

794
01:16:50.28 --> 01:16:55.40
face and learn how important it is to know how to effectively do violence. Yeah. And I'll tell you

795
01:16:55.40 --> 01:17:00.92
what, go get hit in the face with a baton three times and see how you feel the next day. And then

796
01:17:00.92 --> 01:17:05.24
let me put a rear naked choke on you and see how you feel the next day. And by the way, the rear

797
01:17:05.24 --> 01:17:09.16
naked choke will make you want to just kind of comply. And if you don't, you're just going to wake

798
01:17:09.16 --> 01:17:19.08
up in handcuffs in the back of a car. So easy. Yeah. So, so good. And yeah. So you end up hooking these people

799
01:17:19.08 --> 01:17:23.48
up during that and they have to take how many guys that it finally takes to get a cuffs on you?

800
01:17:23.48 --> 01:17:27.80
I didn't know. It just didn't happen. It never happened. I mean, but at the end of it, I'm the

801
01:17:27.80 --> 01:17:32.60
we're probably 30 minutes later from risk to elbow. There's cuffs hanging off me and there's like

802
01:17:32.60 --> 01:17:40.52
I'm bleeding from you know, because they're snapping along and I'm bruised at my radius and

803
01:17:40.52 --> 01:17:42.92
old age is like bone bruised and there's blood dripping off of my arms and I looked like a

804
01:17:42.92 --> 01:17:48.60
like an animal pitball that's been tased a bunch of times in the corner. There's like, you

805
01:17:48.60 --> 01:17:54.76
who's going to have me next? And you know what sucks is? A lot of times people would just think,

806
01:17:54.76 --> 01:17:59.08
oh, he's just really good athlete or something like this. And that was one of my problems. Like,

807
01:17:59.08 --> 01:18:03.72
I'm the worst person to introduce you just to someone. You know, because they're like, well, of course,

808
01:18:03.72 --> 01:18:09.96
you freaking beat me for 24 pounds. Yeah. It's like the best people to introduce is like Jeff Glover,

809
01:18:10.76 --> 01:18:19.40
who's 150 pounds. He's like not intimidating to look at and he's got a big smile on his face

810
01:18:19.40 --> 01:18:24.20
and he's just breaks it off on people. That's who should introduce people to Jitsir.

811
01:18:24.20 --> 01:18:28.04
I'm no, you're no good either. Like you're not a great like a reduction of Jitsir because

812
01:18:28.04 --> 01:18:31.16
people like, who would just have them with that guy's and that was all. You know, that's what they say about me.

813
01:18:31.16 --> 01:18:35.24
Like, you're, you're getting on rolling. You're really strong. Like, thanks, man. I appreciate it.

814
01:18:35.24 --> 01:18:38.84
Yeah. I'm wrong. That's, that's it. I work on that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why I live on my

815
01:18:38.84 --> 01:18:44.60
little. Because, um, yeah. So it's not great to have people that are big introduced Jitsir.

816
01:18:44.60 --> 01:18:49.000
But also it's strange that even in a situation like that, like if I was the overall trainer,

817
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.48
I'd be like, hold on a second. What, what just happened? Yeah. Nine of my cops couldn't get this

818
01:18:53.48 --> 01:18:57.72
guy under control. There's something wrong with you. So the defensive tactics instructor for the

819
01:18:57.72 --> 01:19:05.88
Academy was a Jitsir guy. And I think he wanted, I think he let it go. Oh, God. I think he did.

820
01:19:05.88 --> 01:19:10.68
He was led. Looking back, I was like, oh, he knew it was happening. He knew it was going to hurt.

821
01:19:10.68 --> 01:19:15.96
He wanted them to know. And but at my expense, you know, I lost your pork with my classmates.

822
01:19:15.96 --> 01:19:21.64
I looked like a total asshole. Um, I was a feral animal in the corner. Uh, you know, like,

823
01:19:22.44 --> 01:19:27.24
fur like a, a while people didn't even look at me. But I think you knew what he exacted

824
01:19:27.24 --> 01:19:34.76
to do is dealing. Yeah. So I'm tipping my hat to that clever little shit. Um, you graduate,

825
01:19:34.76 --> 01:19:39.88
which is cool. Um, at this point, you, you had a girl, you have a girlfriend. Yep.

826
01:19:39.88 --> 01:19:45.56
Meme Casey. Yeah. She's great. And you find out that she's pregnant at this point. Um,

827
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:54.04
and at some point, you had had a one night stand with another girl. Yeah.

828
01:19:54.04 --> 01:20:03.32
And she's pregnant. Yep. And at some point, you had a one night stand with another girl.

829
01:20:04.36 --> 01:20:11.96
Yep. And she tracks you down and she's like a ring girl from the UFC or from one of the

830
01:20:11.96 --> 01:20:19.000
UFC. One of these fights you've been in. She's a ring girl. And she shows up at the pit.

831
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.76
Where are you training? Not to tell you that she's pregnant, which I would have taken that.

832
01:20:27.48 --> 01:20:29.80
Yeah. She tells you that she has HIV. Yeah.

833
01:20:35.24 --> 01:20:43.64
And then finally, um, you're like trying to blow off some steam and you go to play paintball with your,

834
01:20:43.64 --> 01:20:47.000
with your, with your, with some friends with your brother and, and like some people

835
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.92
talk rocks at you. Yep. And you, and by the way, you're, you're a, please, where are you

836
01:20:52.92 --> 01:20:57.72
copper at now at this point? Um, I'm to applying to everywhere. Okay. So I was like testing for Santa Barbara

837
01:20:57.72 --> 01:21:04.92
stalked in Sacramento. So you're about to get hired somewhere. I'm in background, which is kind of like

838
01:21:04.92 --> 01:21:09.40
the last step to get hired by these departments. Well, speaking of background, what you decide to do is

839
01:21:09.40 --> 01:21:18.04
these guys, Huck Rocks at you and you assault the vehicle. Yeah. Which, which I can imagine these guys,

840
01:21:18.76 --> 01:21:24.12
that's always, it's always a funny look on people's face when they realized that they did something

841
01:21:24.12 --> 01:21:30.68
that they shouldn't have done. Yep. And Tim Kennedy moves 200 yards in 3.8 seconds with a fully loaded

842
01:21:30.68 --> 01:21:35.000
paintball. Sticks it into their car and unloads as many rounds as you can. That's right.

843
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.28
That's right. Which is kind of funny and we can laugh at it now. But sounds like there was some

844
01:21:42.84 --> 01:21:50.12
politics in your town. Yeah. And small town stuff with, you know, a famous police officer father

845
01:21:50.12 --> 01:21:54.68
with, you know, a brother that is working for a different department or a department whose

846
01:21:54.68 --> 01:22:02.52
who's who's physically at lots of just kind of small town Egos fallen to here. And I get screwed.

847
01:22:02.52 --> 01:22:08.84
And you get the, the basically you're not going to be a cop. That's right. That's not happening.

848
01:22:09.88 --> 01:22:14.04
The whole background. Now you're getting charged with some kind of thing and they're making a look like

849
01:22:14.04 --> 01:22:22.04
you're crazy. Yeah. So you're racking them up. Yeah. Our great decisions just lining them up and not

850
01:22:22.04 --> 01:22:29.56
going to be down. I'm going to go to the book here. I'm standing naked at the end of at the edge of

851
01:22:29.56 --> 01:22:35.64
the ocean halfway through my 23rd year. The cold surf washes over my feet and the wind spreads goose fish

852
01:22:35.64 --> 01:22:42.68
across my skin. Goose flash across my skin. The sun will be up soon. But for now I remain wrapped in

853
01:22:42.68 --> 01:22:47.48
darkness. It's nice to bask in the stillness of this moment. The only sounds are the waves

854
01:22:47.48 --> 01:22:51.56
lapping against the shore. There is something cathartic about being alone on the beach. I grew

855
01:22:51.56 --> 01:22:55.96
up on and stripping my clothes off and letting them hit the sand. I feel incredibly free for the

856
01:22:55.96 --> 01:23:01.56
first time in ages. Normally I'd worry about my wallet and keys getting stolen. But I do not

857
01:23:01.56 --> 01:23:07.24
care at all. What difference does it make? I weighed into Moro Bay just north of the rock ignoring

858
01:23:07.24 --> 01:23:12.12
my brain's warnings that it's too cold and too dark. There's a wall of fog closing in that will

859
01:23:12.12 --> 01:23:16.12
soon make it hard to see my way through the black water. I don't worry about that either.

860
01:23:17.48 --> 01:23:22.76
As I weighed deeper my legs start to burn from the cold water. I pay a ton of pay no attention though.

861
01:23:22.76 --> 01:23:28.52
Even as it covers my legs, then waste, then chest. I barely acknowledge the surface effects.

862
01:23:28.52 --> 01:23:35.32
I don't want to acknowledge it. I don't want to think about it. I don't want to think about anything.

863
01:23:36.92 --> 01:23:42.04
When the waves start picking me up off the sandy ocean floor, I begin to swim west.

864
01:23:43.64 --> 01:23:49.64
I have failed everyone I know and there's no way to fix it. What the fuck is wrong with me? How

865
01:23:49.64 --> 01:23:55.72
the fuck? How did I fuck up everything this quickly? I'm a strong swimmer and in no time the

866
01:23:55.72 --> 01:24:02.60
shore is a distant memory. It's so peaceful out here. My breath missed a little in the waning moon

867
01:24:02.60 --> 01:24:07.24
light, but other than my own breathing and the sound of my hands and legs cutting through the

868
01:24:07.24 --> 01:24:13.72
surf there's nothing. I didn't plan on going for a long swim to nowhere in the pre-dome

869
01:24:13.72 --> 01:24:21.64
blackness, but I needed to forget all of it. My actions, the hurt that they caused and the

870
01:24:21.64 --> 01:24:28.12
disappointment they manifested in everyone around me. I can't hold on to this pain anymore.

871
01:24:30.84 --> 01:24:32.12
I'm just not strong enough.

872
01:24:32.12 --> 01:24:52.04
I kind of breathed through this girl pregnant and then you had this possible HIV. You can't

873
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:57.72
get the job you want to get. This is your 23 years old. Sometimes I'll talk to people that are

874
01:24:57.72 --> 01:25:02.92
16 or 17 or 15 years old and they broke up with their girlfriend or they made this mistake.

875
01:25:02.92 --> 01:25:08.44
I always say listen it seems like your whole world right now, but there's so much more to life.

876
01:25:08.44 --> 01:25:12.60
There's so much to carry on. There'll be other girls. There'll be other opportunities. It's okay.

877
01:25:13.64 --> 01:25:19.24
But damn, that's a lot. That's a lot of shit. A lot of shit going on man.

878
01:25:19.24 --> 01:25:27.40
And an order out of there, my grandpa, who was like the Patriarch of our family, a greatest generation,

879
01:25:27.40 --> 01:25:33.24
woolward to. He's dying in the Vemphazema. Every breath he takes is slightly less than the

880
01:25:33.24 --> 01:25:40.76
prior breath. He's just fighting. He's just becoming a shell of a man and he would be the person

881
01:25:40.76 --> 01:25:45.96
that I would go to. He'd go to the Beach House in Canberra. He listened the waves crash and just

882
01:25:45.96 --> 01:25:52.76
dump on him and he had the grapple with. He's dead. He's dying. Right in the motorcycle,

883
01:25:52.76 --> 01:25:59.64
I already crashed that thing's going. My other cathartic releases going. I was too embarrassed to

884
01:25:59.64 --> 01:26:07.000
be back in the walking to the pit. I can't train right now because I don't know if I've AIDS.

885
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:18.60
So I was just Maro Bay and I walked to the Coast Guard Station and I knocked on the door.

886
01:26:19.24 --> 01:26:24.12
The door flew up and they all knew who I was. They explained that. So I didn't. I'm not going

887
01:26:24.12 --> 01:26:29.08
to read that part of the story, but you swim out to see. And you know, it's weird. It sounds like

888
01:26:29.08 --> 01:26:37.64
you weren't intent on killing yourself, but doesn't sound like you were all that intent on living

889
01:26:37.64 --> 01:26:42.52
either. I don't know. What's the... There's definitely, I think, a wish for a baptism. And this

890
01:26:42.52 --> 01:26:47.16
is a really unique thing is you and I are dealing with lots of mental health and suicide within

891
01:26:47.16 --> 01:26:52.52
the military and addressing it and how do we... There is not like this linear line of

892
01:26:52.52 --> 01:26:56.76
where's depression, where's suicide, where's mental health. You know, what you have here is

893
01:26:56.76 --> 01:27:02.20
you know, an early 20-year-old boy who has made a bunch of bad decisions and he feels hopeless.

894
01:27:02.20 --> 01:27:08.04
And I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go next. And I'm doing something that is

895
01:27:08.04 --> 01:27:14.36
very, very dumb and dangerous and could be the end of my life. But I didn't have an intent

896
01:27:14.36 --> 01:27:22.28
that I'm not trying to kill myself. You know, like there's no cognitive... There's way more efficient

897
01:27:22.28 --> 01:27:28.60
ways than swimming out into the ocean. I definitely kept swimming. And that's a big takeaway that is,

898
01:27:28.60 --> 01:27:32.44
you know, not at the end of the book. There's not that adage. That's, oh, here's what you're

899
01:27:32.44 --> 01:27:37.40
should take away from this, is I kept swimming. You know, as fruit my balls were essentially

900
01:27:37.40 --> 01:27:44.20
up inside my body as I froze into death. And it still doesn't make sense. The Coast Guard said

901
01:27:44.20 --> 01:27:51.16
that somebody called, this is book pre-drawn. This is pre-selfam. There's no way that any of the

902
01:27:51.16 --> 01:27:56.12
houses along Marobe on the north side of the breakers on the north side of the rock could have seen me.

903
01:27:56.12 --> 01:28:01.08
And there's nobody in the parking lot when I got in the water. So I'm not saying there's like a divine

904
01:28:01.08 --> 01:28:07.40
intervention, but doesn't make any sense. How somebody called the Coast Guard station said they saw

905
01:28:07.40 --> 01:28:13.80
young man take his clothes off and swim into the ocean. You know, as a... My open water swim time,

906
01:28:13.80 --> 01:28:20.20
I get 28, 30 minute mile. So an hour into this from the time the Coast Guard said they got the

907
01:28:20.20 --> 01:28:24.76
call to the time that they found me. I'd been swimming for just over an hour. So I'm two miles out into

908
01:28:24.76 --> 01:28:36.36
the fog. Two miles out past the rock. And a really cool thing I discovered when I went to the Coast

909
01:28:36.36 --> 01:28:40.20
Guard station and they throw the door open. Like we're listening to Joe Rookett's podcast listening

910
01:28:40.20 --> 01:28:47.80
about this right here. They have a log book. And one of the most darkest hardest moments in my life.

911
01:28:47.80 --> 01:28:58.44
I'm a single log tag in a date time group. Like time date captain, boat, remarks. That's it.

912
01:28:59.96 --> 01:29:06.12
That's it. What could have been me dying? What became like a moment where I start to make

913
01:29:06.12 --> 01:29:13.16
start to make right decisions is a single line written in pencil in a log book in the Coast Guard shop.

914
01:29:13.16 --> 01:29:26.12
That's wild. Down to that. That could have been it too. Yeah, that last remark line,

915
01:29:26.12 --> 01:29:30.92
you know, pulled an idiot out of the water was pulled a dead body out of the water. That's it.

916
01:29:30.92 --> 01:29:37.40
It's only difference. And you know, I look divine intervention or whatever. You ever tried to

917
01:29:37.40 --> 01:29:43.56
recover a single swimmer at sea on a foggy night. Two miles out the ocean crazy. That is not like

918
01:29:43.56 --> 01:29:47.88
you plan to do that. You got an IR strobe. You have to go white strobe. You have to freaking

919
01:29:47.88 --> 01:29:52.12
swing or cam light above your head. Like it's hard. If they had thermal, they did it. I mean,

920
01:29:52.12 --> 01:29:55.96
it was you just if they didn't have thermal, that's a miracle. Yeah, I'm going to say it quite honestly.

921
01:29:55.96 --> 01:30:01.56
And and if you told me, if I got a call that, hey, some idiot got naked and started swimming

922
01:30:01.56 --> 01:30:09.72
up to see I'd be looking 300 yards out. Yeah, maybe maybe 500 yards out. Maybe a thousand at the

923
01:30:09.72 --> 01:30:14.52
most. There's no way someone's going to be too much. Like that's crazy that they found you.

924
01:30:15.24 --> 01:30:21.40
Dead dense fog. Dense fog. So dense on the south side of the rock where the breakers are in the

925
01:30:21.40 --> 01:30:26.20
entrance tomorrow bay. There's a fog horn. I couldn't hear the fog horn. And you know, you can hear

926
01:30:26.20 --> 01:30:30.28
that from miles. The fog is so dense and it was it was padding sound. I couldn't hear the waves.

927
01:30:30.28 --> 01:30:35.40
You know, it does really weird things to light. There is barely any light at this point.

928
01:30:36.28 --> 01:30:41.80
No star light. No moon light. I'm just I've just been swimming for an hour. And when this boat

929
01:30:41.80 --> 01:30:49.72
rolls up, I think I'm losing my sanity because I hear it. They just have an idol and it's cruising

930
01:30:49.72 --> 01:30:53.80
and the captain has his feet hanging over the front of the boat. And he's just like sit there

931
01:30:53.80 --> 01:30:58.68
with his feet. And he's like, hey, what are you doing? And swimming. He sounded like the cool is

932
01:30:58.68 --> 01:31:04.36
there's so cool. He's like making fun of you. Yeah. What are you doing? I'm swimming. No shit.

933
01:31:05.40 --> 01:31:11.40
Like even now. Even even currently you're like this. You know, that was the first indication to him

934
01:31:11.40 --> 01:31:15.000
that he was going to take a different approach, I think. And then he's like, so what's going on?

935
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.48
And I give him a summary of what's happening. And he's just like, yeah, I was thinking about

936
01:31:21.48 --> 01:31:29.32
pulling you out of the water, but maybe just stay in the drink. He says this to me. That is like, yeah.

937
01:31:29.32 --> 01:31:36.20
Man, it's cold. He's cold. He's like, I see that. He's my explosion. And then he doesn't help me.

938
01:31:36.20 --> 01:31:40.60
He throws a cargo net down the side of that ship. And he makes me clamber up the side of that

939
01:31:40.60 --> 01:31:43.80
boat with my, I mean, I couldn't use my fingers. I couldn't feel anything. You know, an hour and

940
01:31:43.80 --> 01:31:49.64
50, 50, 50, 30 degree water also like, I had to have kept swimming pretty actively to not be

941
01:31:49.64 --> 01:31:57.000
hypothermic. You know, you have a minute of what kind of like active use 10 minutes of use of your

942
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.20
fingers, digits. And then an hour is kind of a threshold where you start losing control your body.

943
01:32:02.84 --> 01:32:07.80
And I was at that threshold. And he throws a cargo net over the side of the boat, climb up.

944
01:32:08.44 --> 01:32:15.32
You know, I'm not helping you. You did this. You get out. Show me. Show me. He didn't say anything

945
01:32:15.32 --> 01:32:19.72
besides there's not going to be somebody to do this again. It's all he said 20 minute boat

946
01:32:19.72 --> 01:32:24.28
ride back in. I had to go back all the way around the rock, come back into the bay, and then go to

947
01:32:24.28 --> 01:32:30.92
the Coast Guard Station, dock, not a word, just sat there. And then what they do with you. Nothing.

948
01:32:32.60 --> 01:32:39.72
He asked if I was good. I had to walk from the Coast Guard Station back to my car at the rock.

949
01:32:39.72 --> 01:32:45.88
It's about a mile. Did you feel, what'd you think? Every step I was trying to

950
01:32:45.88 --> 01:32:52.20
did he give you clothes? I had a blanket. I had a blanket. You say one of those old maybe wool

951
01:32:52.20 --> 01:32:57.000
but it's like green. Yeah. And it is I mean it's sandpaper. Yeah. Is that what you say?

952
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.92
Well, they did not have real blankets. No, like, well, I don't know what they have now, but for

953
01:33:00.92 --> 01:33:04.52
100% when I went to boot camp, like you're sleeping with one of those things and then like the

954
01:33:04.52 --> 01:33:10.28
standard issue blanket. If you were somewhere, was that stupid green wool itchy blanket. It is terrible.

955
01:33:10.28 --> 01:33:16.28
And to frozen skin, it feels like hot needles. It was terrible. And I walked all that mile back to

956
01:33:16.28 --> 01:33:21.64
the Coast to get my car. It seems weird that this guy wouldn't have been like, hey, this kid

957
01:33:21.64 --> 01:33:29.08
needs some help, like some some mental health assistance here. I, um, I don't remember what I said,

958
01:33:29.08 --> 01:33:40.44
but it was definitely gratitude and it was gratitude that I'm alive. And if I was looking for

959
01:33:40.44 --> 01:33:45.96
a baptism, however you emerge from the water emotionally and physically post baptism, I think

960
01:33:45.96 --> 01:33:51.80
there's this transformation where, all right, I definitely did not start doing it, right? But I was

961
01:33:51.80 --> 01:33:58.44
done doing it wrong. And, um, I don't know if it was discernment. Maybe it was naive on his part.

962
01:34:02.04 --> 01:34:07.000
From that moment, I mean, you would have to have strapped me down. Like what I went to selection,

963
01:34:08.28 --> 01:34:13.16
they would have had to have found me in my sleep and executed me in my sleep for me to quit.

964
01:34:14.36 --> 01:34:18.76
This was the beginning of that mentality where there's nothing that you're going to do to stop me.

965
01:34:18.76 --> 01:34:26.12
What was your family's reaction to the two girls? It's like, when you write about it in the book,

966
01:34:27.08 --> 01:34:30.44
your dad finds out, he's like, well, you know, I heard you got a girl pregnant. He's like,

967
01:34:30.44 --> 01:34:35.32
you and you say, yeah, and he's like, no, this other girl, you know, I was too much of the coward

968
01:34:35.32 --> 01:34:42.68
and tell him, God. So they find out from my pastor because the other woman calls my church

969
01:34:42.68 --> 01:34:50.28
to try and, because she's trying to get resources, you know, how am I going to pay for, you know,

970
01:34:50.28 --> 01:34:56.76
burthing this man's child? And so she's calling the church, being like, can I get help? And the

971
01:34:56.76 --> 01:35:01.56
pastor's like, wait a second, who are you? That's not the name I know. So when he calls my dad,

972
01:35:01.96 --> 01:35:08.44
my dad's like, what's going on? And I was just too pathetic of a coward to have the balls

973
01:35:08.44 --> 01:35:12.28
just to tell my family, hey, here's the decisions that I'm struggling through right now.

974
01:35:12.28 --> 01:35:15.80
The reason I have to go to a San Luis Biscoe every single month is to get an HIV test.

975
01:35:16.36 --> 01:35:20.76
And the reason that I'm, you know, I don't have any money for anything is because I'm paying two separate

976
01:35:20.76 --> 01:35:29.72
women, best of what preparing, it's expensive to have a child. You know, definitely prepare for

977
01:35:29.72 --> 01:35:35.24
having a child, don't do it on plan. And the children, the kids end up being born 90s apart, is that right?

978
01:35:35.24 --> 01:35:43.64
Two weeks. Two weeks apart. They're amazing. Yeah, yeah, they're definitely blessed to be here.

979
01:35:43.64 --> 01:35:46.04
For you can awesome. Yeah.

980
01:35:49.88 --> 01:35:53.96
You had, after you already mentioned this earlier in the podcast, but after September 11th,

981
01:35:53.96 --> 01:36:01.48
you had gone down to the recruiting station and like put me in coach. You tried, you tried the

982
01:36:01.48 --> 01:36:07.56
Navy. So are you, are you thinking to see a team? For sure. And it was closed. Yeah, no recruiter.

983
01:36:10.44 --> 01:36:13.40
So the next one was the Marine Corps. How did you decide between the Marine Corps and the Army?

984
01:36:14.60 --> 01:36:21.72
The 18x rate program was the, the Marines didn't have a direct route to go, there was no more

985
01:36:21.72 --> 01:36:26.28
sock at the time so they didn't have a clear defined pathway to go to recon. Right. And go in

986
01:36:26.28 --> 01:36:34.60
as a rifleman from rifleman. You can go and try out within your own unit and then if you get selected,

987
01:36:34.60 --> 01:36:38.76
you select that was going to be a very undefined process. When I went to the Army recruiter,

988
01:36:38.76 --> 01:36:42.92
they said, all right, well, here's this new program to make it to special operations. You go through

989
01:36:42.92 --> 01:36:47.88
if you're tree school, you go to airborne school, you go to this a trader called SOPSY. You get through

990
01:36:47.88 --> 01:36:53.72
SOPSY, then you can go to selection. And if you get selected, then go to the QCourse. If you finish the QCourse,

991
01:36:53.72 --> 01:36:58.28
then you get to go to special forces. It's like a clean of a track as you could possibly.

992
01:36:58.28 --> 01:37:04.28
Yeah, he laid it out for me. But they didn't call you so you did that after September 11th,

993
01:37:04.28 --> 01:37:08.60
but there was no room. No, right. And so you're just, you're carrying on with your life. All this

994
01:37:08.60 --> 01:37:15.72
other shit happens. Yep. And then by the grace of God, like a week after the swimming incidents,

995
01:37:15.72 --> 01:37:20.28
the naked swimming incident, a phone rings. Yeah, your phone rings and they say, hey, we got a

996
01:37:20.28 --> 01:37:26.04
spot for you. Yep. In the Army, you know, you get a new name was Vaughn recruiter, Vaughn or something like that.

997
01:37:26.60 --> 01:37:33.16
So we got, you know, as VapScore is good, D-LapScore is good. We can send you new maps in two weeks

998
01:37:34.36 --> 01:37:43.08
to in process as an 11 Bravo to become an 18th next-ray. So you're, this is like a no brainer at this.

999
01:37:43.64 --> 01:37:48.76
This is like, no, there's no choice. There's not, you're, you've signed that line as soon as

1000
01:37:48.76 --> 01:37:55.80
that paper was in front of you. That's right. And how long was it between that call? Was it two weeks

1001
01:37:55.80 --> 01:38:01.08
before you left? Oh, it's for you out of there? Yep. That's pretty awesome. Yeah, there was, um,

1002
01:38:02.84 --> 01:38:12.28
from the time, from 9-11 to the call was like 10 months and then, um, they didn't do a delayed

1003
01:38:12.28 --> 01:38:17.64
entry. I, I finished my undergrad, was in grad school. So they're, we're trying to finish school,

1004
01:38:17.64 --> 01:38:24.12
but ultimately once I got my shipdate, I just left. I thought it was better to just go. Just go.

1005
01:38:24.12 --> 01:38:30.04
Yeah. Boot camp. Fun. You had fun at Boot camp. I did.

1006
01:38:30.04 --> 01:38:37.96
Was now, how old are you now? 23? Yep. 23 years old. Um, no factor.

1007
01:38:38.52 --> 01:38:42.52
Then, then you, you get this bonus program of the special operations prep course.

1008
01:38:42.52 --> 01:38:50.36
And part of it is is this, this whole idea of this 18 x-ray program means that you can do this,

1009
01:38:50.36 --> 01:38:57.000
really kind of short path to get to special forces, which some people in special forces think

1010
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.08
that's like not right, not the right way to do it and you don't deserve to be here and you need to

1011
01:39:01.08 --> 01:39:07.32
pay your dues. Like I paid, we're not wrong. Well, the only thing I'll say about that is

1012
01:39:07.32 --> 01:39:14.20
in talking to a lot of the SOG guys were Vietnam that went in Warren's sock where they had more than

1013
01:39:14.20 --> 01:39:19.56
100% cash with you rate. Yeah. A lot of those guys, they took them right off the streets and

1014
01:39:19.56 --> 01:39:25.48
sent them a special forces. And I've had those guys tell me like, yeah, whatever. And they were bad.

1015
01:39:25.48 --> 01:39:28.84
They were as bad asses and humans that have ever walked the plan that the guys don't want to

1016
01:39:28.84 --> 01:39:32.20
sock and be out. I was the last time that they did the e-connected reposer. That's what they did.

1017
01:39:32.20 --> 01:39:39.08
From there. And that they rinse and repeat, like, we need dudes. We need a dudes then. This is

1018
01:39:39.08 --> 01:39:47.16
what we did then. Let's just give it a try now. So you're, so you go to the special operations prep course.

1019
01:39:47.16 --> 01:39:52.68
What you call it, so you're in sopsy and this is basically a boot beat down. Yeah, it's just in

1020
01:39:52.68 --> 01:40:03.72
Tritter. PT twice a day, land-nav twice a week, rock-run, rock-run, rock-run. And it's weird. I don't know if

1021
01:40:03.72 --> 01:40:08.60
I grasp this. So you're there. Yeah, you're living in a barracks, whatever. There's how many people

1022
01:40:08.60 --> 01:40:14.60
are there with you? Over the court. So a couple of green or a couple of kids died in selection,

1023
01:40:14.60 --> 01:40:22.52
the prior summer. So they cancel selections from heat exhaustion, exposure. So from May and

1024
01:40:22.52 --> 01:40:29.88
tell August, they cancel selections at the North Carolina. So the course that you're all trying to

1025
01:40:29.88 --> 01:40:35.56
get into is canceled. We have to wait three months for the first one to happen in August. So you're

1026
01:40:35.56 --> 01:40:42.04
in this special operations prep course. Yep. And it's supposed to be a six-week course. It ends up

1027
01:40:42.04 --> 01:40:47.48
being a three-and-a-half month course. And that's what, so I was tracking this. And people just keep

1028
01:40:47.48 --> 01:40:52.60
showing up. That's right. To get ready to go to the, to go to the, to go to the course in selection.

1029
01:40:53.32 --> 01:40:58.92
But they're, they're just quitting. It's a revolving door of quitters. Of buses arriving every weekend

1030
01:40:58.92 --> 01:41:03.24
from basic training. So you go to basic training, you go to infantry school, you go to airborne school.

1031
01:41:03.24 --> 01:41:07.72
And then the guys that make it from there hop on a bus and go to Fort Bragnow, Carolina. They show up

1032
01:41:07.72 --> 01:41:14.04
at Sopsie Barracks. And you, you show up to your morning formation. And then you go off and you get your

1033
01:41:14.04 --> 01:41:22.04
dick pushed in. That's it. And from May until August, every bus that came in was a new load of people

1034
01:41:22.04 --> 01:41:27.72
for them to get rid of. So I think over the course, you know, we're somewhere between five to six hundred

1035
01:41:27.72 --> 01:41:34.76
studs show up during those three to four months. And how many of them went to selection? 91.

1036
01:41:36.36 --> 01:41:41.08
Yeah. And you were just there the whole time. Well, we got there. We got there in May.

1037
01:41:41.08 --> 01:41:47.32
But tell you what the 91 did that went. 88 of us got selected. Yeah, that's what that's what you go on to say.

1038
01:41:47.32 --> 01:41:54.12
Yeah. So typically you get eight out of a hundred at a selection. So if I have 400 people there,

1039
01:41:54.12 --> 01:42:02.36
you know, we're going to have, right, 16 24 32 guys that get selected. And so we got, we batted 88 at a 91.

1040
01:42:02.36 --> 01:42:08.60
There's no way that you could get rid of us. Yeah. Because you've been just getting crushed. Yeah.

1041
01:42:08.60 --> 01:42:14.60
For every event that happens in selection, they had tested us on every month during the three months.

1042
01:42:14.60 --> 01:42:20.92
So my 12 miles, I knew what my, I knew exactly my pace counts, my times, my five mile times,

1043
01:42:20.92 --> 01:42:26.20
like bring it, bro. There's nothing. Kill me in my sleep. That's the only way. And how long is

1044
01:42:26.20 --> 01:42:33.000
selection itself a month? And that's 27 days. That's more of it was basically the same as socks

1045
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.36
socksy, but it was counting now. Yeah. Yep. That's it. So when we get there, it was selection was

1046
01:42:40.36 --> 01:42:48.36
easy for us because they had to stick to the, the clear, you have to test guys in vacuums to be able

1047
01:42:48.36 --> 01:42:54.68
to compare, make sure that you're giving the fair test measurement to these guys going through.

1048
01:42:55.40 --> 01:43:02.68
So when we didn't have to go into the gig pit in between events, we got to sleep in between

1049
01:43:02.68 --> 01:43:08.28
events. This was new to us. I think what is this, we had been cheating for the past four months.

1050
01:43:08.28 --> 01:43:16.12
You know, we had figured out, we had reorganized ourselves into alphabetical barracks. So

1051
01:43:16.12 --> 01:43:21.32
and we would line up alphabetically. So we knew kind of the fire order of how people were

1052
01:43:21.32 --> 01:43:25.64
going to be called. We had figured out a rotation of when guys are going to be running to the board.

1053
01:43:25.64 --> 01:43:30.36
So we don't only have two people up, instead of, you know, the prescribed number that they were

1054
01:43:30.36 --> 01:43:34.04
to acquire. So when somebody would come in, somebody had alert us, we'd all wake up. We'd be sitting

1055
01:43:34.04 --> 01:43:37.56
there. We're just cheating. And now we cheated our way through everything.

1056
01:43:37.56 --> 01:43:44.76
Or cheated cheated cheated. Then what what socks is though, you get done with, you get done with

1057
01:43:45.32 --> 01:43:52.84
a selection. And then you get sent back to Sobsi again for more time in purgatory. Yep.

1058
01:43:53.48 --> 01:43:58.68
Well, it's a, it's a new Sobsi. This one's called Sobsi too. So the next a trigger where they lost

1059
01:43:58.68 --> 01:44:06.36
all of us. And this is what I say us, the 18 x-rays. Most special forces guys going through

1060
01:44:06.36 --> 01:44:11.72
post selection. The, the next phase that go to is small unit tactics phase two. And most

1061
01:44:11.72 --> 01:44:15.72
infantrymen, you got seven dash eight. You know, you've been spending time in the 80s, second,

1062
01:44:15.72 --> 01:44:20.36
or you're coming for range of regiments. You know how to, you know how to do army things. We don't

1063
01:44:20.36 --> 01:44:26.20
know how to do army things. So when we get done with selection, they put us into a pretty small unit

1064
01:44:26.20 --> 01:44:31.88
tactics training course. It ends up not being a high-attritor. We only lose maybe 10% of the

1065
01:44:31.88 --> 01:44:39.16
guys that are there. And they're legitimately teaching us react to contact how to do an ambush.

1066
01:44:39.16 --> 01:44:47.56
How, like basic seven dash eight infantrymen stuff for when we get to small unit tactics,

1067
01:44:47.56 --> 01:44:53.40
because small unit tactics isn't a trigger. They lose lots of guys there. So you actually got

1068
01:44:53.40 --> 01:45:02.52
extra preparation to get ready for small unit tactics school. Yeah. So you guys must have done really

1069
01:45:02.52 --> 01:45:08.12
well. And that as well. Yeah. We were, we were starving to get into the Q-course proper and phase two

1070
01:45:08.12 --> 01:45:13.96
is the first post selection. That is the first moment where like you are in the Q-course. You are now

1071
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:20.60
in the pipeline to become a green beret. And then what's next? So what came after that? So then you

1072
01:45:20.60 --> 01:45:28.28
learn your, you get up to this point. You're in 18X, right? You have a not defined MOS. So then you get

1073
01:45:28.28 --> 01:45:35.000
your, you get to go to your MOS school. You have a bravo Charlie Delta or Echo. I got bravo,

1074
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.96
which was a weapon sergeant. And then you got the, so I went to my three-month MOS training,

1075
01:45:39.96 --> 01:45:46.04
which is phase three. And then I read this right. The weapons, the 18 bravos, the the highest

1076
01:45:46.04 --> 01:45:59.08
attrition rate. I was right. How come? We're dumb. It is, it is, it is, we are not just, it's not just

1077
01:45:59.08 --> 01:46:04.04
weapons. Like, they're called weapon sergeants, but we're tested on basic security, we're, we're

1078
01:46:04.04 --> 01:46:11.64
tested, we're responsible for all of the elements of the ODAs kind of preparedness for running

1079
01:46:11.64 --> 01:46:17.48
ranges and deployments. And if we're going to be going traveling overseas, the bravo is the

1080
01:46:17.48 --> 01:46:22.36
guy that's going to have the force response plan, the emergency action plan, the evacuation plan,

1081
01:46:23.16 --> 01:46:29.08
in addition to, you know, knowing how to run a mortar, how to set up, you know, close to our

1082
01:46:29.08 --> 01:46:35.72
support. That is all bravo stuff. Are you guys like, you guys do the closer support on the radio, too?

1083
01:46:35.72 --> 01:46:41.72
Mm-hmm. On regular ODAs, it's typically the bravo or the echo that goes to those courses.

1084
01:46:41.72 --> 01:46:47.08
Check. So you go to that school. You have the honor graduate of that school. Yep.

1085
01:46:49.08 --> 01:46:53.48
Yeah. That's fun. What were you, what were you, what did you excel at in the school?

1086
01:46:53.48 --> 01:46:59.32
I loved guns. As, as an armor now and I own a weapons manufacturing company,

1087
01:46:59.32 --> 01:47:08.52
I've always just loved the watches and firearms. I love the mechanics of how things work.

1088
01:47:09.24 --> 01:47:15.000
And I, and one of the funnest things about the 18 bravo courses, you'll get this like bucket of

1089
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.96
parts. And it'll be an ozee, they'll be, you know, parts to a goostoff that you don't get to build

1090
01:47:19.96 --> 01:47:23.24
because the rest of the goostoff's not there. You know, you're going to have an FNFL. You know, you're

1091
01:47:23.24 --> 01:47:28.28
going to have an AR. And you get, and like, go, time starts now assemble. You're like, well,

1092
01:47:28.28 --> 01:47:31.88
I don't have the tube. So I don't need this. And then you start putting things together.

1093
01:47:31.88 --> 01:47:35.56
Like this is the block from the ozee cool. Here's the trigger. So assembly of the ozee,

1094
01:47:35.56 --> 01:47:41.40
here's here's the trigger. You know, I'm just, I was like, in my brain just loved it. I just loved it.

1095
01:47:44.44 --> 01:47:47.56
All right, on. So that means you're going to be an 18 bravo. And then what comes next?

1096
01:47:47.56 --> 01:47:51.40
Is Robin Sage next? So they did it a little bit different for us. We did it.

1097
01:47:51.40 --> 01:47:56.60
Are you did some compressed language school? Yeah. Yeah. In, which is, in the last manual.

1098
01:47:56.60 --> 01:48:01.64
Yeah. We normally, you have like three months in a language because every green

1099
01:48:01.64 --> 01:48:09.40
bra has to have a minimum of a second language. And they took anyone that had any degree of

1100
01:48:09.40 --> 01:48:17.96
language. And like this is peak war. You know, this is 2004, 2005. And body bags are coming in

1101
01:48:17.96 --> 01:48:23.08
every day at the JFK chapel at Fort Bragg. If they're having a new ceremony for a dead green bra.

1102
01:48:23.08 --> 01:48:28.52
Like this is, and our instructors are just livid that they're the ones that are stuck at

1103
01:48:28.52 --> 01:48:33.24
SWIC having to train us. You know, they, they don't want to be there. And I get it. They want to be

1104
01:48:33.24 --> 01:48:39.16
back with their teams. And we, the, the young want to be green braids. Like we're just

1105
01:48:39.16 --> 01:48:44.76
shamping at the bit to get out. And we're doing everything. We're, we're trying to cut every corner.

1106
01:48:44.76 --> 01:48:48.52
We're trying to, if you graduate on a Friday, most people would want like a month to recover.

1107
01:48:48.52 --> 01:48:52.12
Not at this time. Can, is there any ways, or any spots for me to start on Monday?

1108
01:48:52.12 --> 01:48:59.000
And, and when somebody says, hey, you can skip two months of language school if you do this program.

1109
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.76
Is it? I'm in. Yeah. Throw me in there. And when did you take Spanish? Yep.

1110
01:49:04.76 --> 01:49:08.20
Wish I took a Russian. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1111
01:49:09.80 --> 01:49:15.56
So then comes Robin's Robin's age. And this is where like it seems like all your mischievous life

1112
01:49:15.56 --> 01:49:21.64
gets to be utilized. Yeah. Right. You get to, you get rewarded for being sneaky.

1113
01:49:22.52 --> 01:49:25.64
One of the ops that you talk about, one of the training ops that you talk about in there.

1114
01:49:25.64 --> 01:49:30.84
You're supposed to assault someplace. And you guys go in and, and drain like,

1115
01:49:31.64 --> 01:49:37.08
most of the fuel of all the generators. Yeah. And, and you have it all kind of time. So that

1116
01:49:37.64 --> 01:49:41.48
in the middle of the night, all the generators fail. That's right. Which means all the lights go out.

1117
01:49:41.48 --> 01:49:46.44
Which means there's confusion by the cadre. And then you guys roll in there. Yeah. Like, you're

1118
01:49:46.44 --> 01:49:51.88
getting after him. Yeah. We, we, one of our friends, that he had like a staff infection. He was,

1119
01:49:51.88 --> 01:49:57.80
he was support for the cadre. And we were supposed to turn all our cell phones. We had prison

1120
01:49:57.80 --> 01:50:02.44
pockets, so our cell phones were definitely still on us. So we're getting text messages as we're

1121
01:50:02.44 --> 01:50:05.56
getting to like our network. Our next objective is going to be we're going to the updates as to

1122
01:50:05.56 --> 01:50:09.48
when the cadre are going to roll and blow us out. We're getting like play by plays of what their

1123
01:50:09.48 --> 01:50:15.24
plans are. And so we get where the objective is going to be, what time the hit time is going to be.

1124
01:50:15.24 --> 01:50:19.72
So we get there as they're setting up. We're siphon out gas out of the generators. We already know

1125
01:50:19.72 --> 01:50:24.28
which vehicles are the cadre vehicles. So when they roll up to start setting things up and the

1126
01:50:24.28 --> 01:50:29.16
lights go out. And we're just like, like, we've actually agreed over our faces. We've been blacked out

1127
01:50:29.16 --> 01:50:33.72
our uniforms. And we just cruise up and stole all their stuff. We stole their tobacco. We stole

1128
01:50:33.72 --> 01:50:39.32
their headlamps. We stole their uniforms. I stole a kid. One of the cadre is kids toys. I

1129
01:50:39.32 --> 01:50:46.28
just car. You know, they loved it. Oh, yeah. You know, this is again, peak war. Where they're like,

1130
01:50:46.28 --> 01:50:51.72
KD's Deeter Hungry. Yeah, that's what we want. That's awesome. You go to Searschool. You freaking

1131
01:50:51.72 --> 01:51:00.04
cheat in Searschool in a big way. Yeah. You go out and you hide MREs and caches throughout the

1132
01:51:00.04 --> 01:51:07.56
A.o. So you can eat. Yeah. Again, we get informed as to where our invasion lane is going to be.

1133
01:51:07.56 --> 01:51:14.76
They give me like a left asmith and a right asmith. And this is my invasion lane. So we go and I take

1134
01:51:14.76 --> 01:51:19.32
boxes and MREs and I go and I dig them and plant them with head and digit grid coordinates as to where

1135
01:51:19.32 --> 01:51:24.36
these boxes and MREs are on our invasion lane. So when they get cut loose, when they let us loose and

1136
01:51:24.36 --> 01:51:27.80
be like, all right, we're going to chase you guys. You know, you got your couple of hours to go.

1137
01:51:29.24 --> 01:51:35.40
Like we just be lined straight asmith to the first box at MREs. Dig those things up.

1138
01:51:35.40 --> 01:51:42.68
And you had a crew that was in on it. Yep. Bunch 18x trace. Mostly. Except for one Air Force guy.

1139
01:51:43.40 --> 01:51:51.16
And to his credit, he, you know, he didn't want to break any rules and he thought that we're cheating.

1140
01:51:51.80 --> 01:51:58.92
We were. And so when he said he wasn't going to eat that MREs, cool, we ate that MRE of his.

1141
01:51:58.92 --> 01:52:03.16
But we helped him and as best we could. Like if he's going to be a man of integrity and ethics,

1142
01:52:03.16 --> 01:52:08.76
we hunted for him, you know, we forged for him, we tried to get and he would get all of that food.

1143
01:52:08.76 --> 01:52:13.32
Like if I'm getting deer corn, if I'm if I'm if I'm dumpster diving into somebody's backyard

1144
01:52:13.32 --> 01:52:17.40
and I find, you know, a leftover sandwich, like he's getting all of it. It's not getting split 12 ways.

1145
01:52:17.40 --> 01:52:21.56
He gets all of it. So he was better off than any other dude and any other invasion team.

1146
01:52:22.20 --> 01:52:25.80
As like there are a lot of 11 other people forging for him.

1147
01:52:25.80 --> 01:52:35.40
And until you finally reach the your motivation to knock it caught is the longer that you stay on the

1148
01:52:35.40 --> 01:52:40.36
lamb, the longer that you stay running, that's the less time that you spend in a concentration camp

1149
01:52:40.36 --> 01:52:49.16
beginning using advanced interrogation techniques. So you get a weak and camp slabby period.

1150
01:52:49.16 --> 01:52:53.72
You're going to get you're going to get period. And less you get caught early. If you get caught

1151
01:52:53.72 --> 01:52:59.88
early every day that you get caught early is an extra-dant camp slabby. So when we get to the,

1152
01:52:59.88 --> 01:53:05.56
you know, the final phase of seer, the camp's already full. We're the last team to roll in there.

1153
01:53:05.56 --> 01:53:10.68
And you know, we get betrayed by our contact, our career that's supposed to take us out of the

1154
01:53:10.68 --> 01:53:17.32
country and he turns us over to the invading forces and we have black bags of our head. They pop

1155
01:53:17.32 --> 01:53:21.24
them off. They start slapping us and they're going down the line and all of us are lined up and they're

1156
01:53:21.24 --> 01:53:25.80
doing the interrogation thing pretty rough and it's one of the most dangerous times is when you're

1157
01:53:25.80 --> 01:53:30.60
initially captured. So there's really strict things that you're supposed to do to not encourage

1158
01:53:30.60 --> 01:53:36.12
them to be more violent because that's when executions happen in real war. You know, like immediately

1159
01:53:36.12 --> 01:53:40.20
after capture like that's a really dangerous time. You want to be really compliant. You want to really

1160
01:53:40.20 --> 01:53:49.24
stick to this, this method of being as complicit as you can, perceptual wise. Until that dude's

1161
01:53:49.24 --> 01:53:55.88
bag comes off and he just starts singing like a canary. These guys cheated. They buried food and the

1162
01:53:55.88 --> 01:54:01.88
whole, it was like, you could hear a pin drop. You could, all the categories stopped talking. All

1163
01:54:01.88 --> 01:54:06.52
of them descended like sharks under this one guy and they said, what do you say? They buried food.

1164
01:54:06.52 --> 01:54:10.12
This whole team has been eating that MRU's. They knew exactly where they're going to be going.

1165
01:54:10.92 --> 01:54:17.32
They took all 11 of us and they separated us immediately. So seer school became real.

1166
01:54:17.32 --> 01:54:24.76
And it went from school to real life immediately because if you cheated, if you got

1167
01:54:24.76 --> 01:54:29.16
comfort cheated, all this idea of being a green brain would be thrown out of the window. It's gone.

1168
01:54:29.16 --> 01:54:34.84
You have to be no recycled. This is an integrity violation. It's different than failing.

1169
01:54:35.48 --> 01:54:41.96
Failing you sometimes get to get rehabilitated and come back. If you cheated, you're out.

1170
01:54:41.96 --> 01:54:51.64
Yeah. So all of you separated have to maintain the same story. 11 of us for seven days.

1171
01:54:53.48 --> 01:55:00.28
Waterboarding, ice tanks, pain positions. And all their interrogation was based around. Did you

1172
01:55:00.28 --> 01:55:06.28
cheat or not? That's right. Yeah. Did you have food? Where'd you get the food? Who buried the food?

1173
01:55:06.28 --> 01:55:13.32
Hey, Tim told us, you know, you can stay. We're ticking Tim's already gone. You know,

1174
01:55:13.32 --> 01:55:23.72
Tim told us and you can stay. We just need it be cooperated. So Sean Stain, he backed him up.

1175
01:55:23.72 --> 01:55:28.20
We just need one more. They're good. These are professional interrogators.

1176
01:55:28.20 --> 01:55:38.04
And the whole team held whole team. Not one of us broke. And the final day of

1177
01:55:38.04 --> 01:55:42.44
sear school when things just start getting crazier and crazier. People are flying through the air.

1178
01:55:42.44 --> 01:55:46.44
You know, and like, I get made fun of getting beaten, getting sprayed down with hoses and

1179
01:55:46.44 --> 01:55:50.92
getting worse and worse and worse and worse. And all of a sudden, a moment happens where you know,

1180
01:55:50.92 --> 01:55:54.52
it's the end of sear school. And I'm not going to ruin that moment because it's one of the most

1181
01:55:54.52 --> 01:56:01.32
significant emotional moments. And it's um, and I just look around, I got my 11 brothers.

1182
01:56:02.44 --> 01:56:04.36
All 11 of us stand right there.

1183
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:11.40
The cadre show up to our donning of our green beret. So at the end of the school, they're like,

1184
01:56:11.40 --> 01:56:17.32
hey, we need to talk to you guys. And we're like, zero chance. Well, I see you got your art.

1185
01:56:17.32 --> 01:56:21.08
You pulled your ID card out of your neck and it's hanging from your land. You're here. I don't give a

1186
01:56:21.08 --> 01:56:25.64
fuck. You know, like, I don't zero chance any of us are saying anything. You can meet us when I put my green

1187
01:56:25.64 --> 01:56:31.88
beret on it. So we get our knife. We sign our our name in the book Truth. We throw in our green beret. We learn

1188
01:56:31.88 --> 01:56:37.72
what group we're going to and they're all standing there at that ceremony being like, we need to talk to you

1189
01:56:37.72 --> 01:56:43.88
guys. It was, it was a proof of concepts one, one, one for the, for one of the first times they had to

1190
01:56:43.88 --> 01:56:51.000
legitimately do interrogations on people that legitimately had something to hide to see and it proved

1191
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:58.84
that the things that they were teaching. What worked? Yeah. That's awesome. That's, that's pretty awesome

1192
01:56:58.84 --> 01:57:02.76
that everyone's stuck it out. Yeah. Because when they start saying, hey, look, we already kicked him out.

1193
01:57:02.76 --> 01:57:06.76
He's, he's, he's going to the, whatever he called in the, in the army, we call it the fleet and

1194
01:57:06.76 --> 01:57:11.40
AB, but there's an hell of, yeah, Tim already, or hey, Tim just ratted you guys out. He's trying to save

1195
01:57:11.40 --> 01:57:15.96
himself over there. We're keeping him because he said, you're the one that planned it. They start

1196
01:57:15.96 --> 01:57:21.96
doing that shit. They're breaking people down. Zero chance. But the worst part was they had one guy.

1197
01:57:21.96 --> 01:57:27.16
You know, they had one guy that had told them everything. So they were going off of all of his,

1198
01:57:27.16 --> 01:57:33.56
is it information, which was all true. So it was a really hard thing in my head as they're recounting

1199
01:57:33.56 --> 01:57:38.36
what, like, we knew exactly, he, he, he, he very accurately described, which I was really impressed

1200
01:57:38.36 --> 01:57:42.84
that he can remember, you know, he didn't have the grid coordinates, but he remembered exactly where it

1201
01:57:42.84 --> 01:57:48.20
was off of the airfield. It was about 200 meters in from this road, off of this airfield. It was

1202
01:57:48.20 --> 01:57:58.04
under this big log. And I got to throw out a warning, Tim, anyone that's going through selection?

1203
01:57:58.04 --> 01:58:04.68
What Tim Kennedy did is not smart. Don't do this. Don't do that. And the idea of, like, if you ain't

1204
01:58:04.68 --> 01:58:10.36
cheating, you ain't trying, is actually not a good thing to do because you're risking your career

1205
01:58:10.36 --> 01:58:17.48
and Tim Kennedy and his 11 friends freaking out away with it by a miracle. Don't do this kind of

1206
01:58:17.48 --> 01:58:22.92
shit. Learn how to cheat at your ODA. When you get there, you and your team. There's, there are

1207
01:58:22.92 --> 01:58:26.92
methods about how you're going to cheat in countries called resistance. It's called unconventional

1208
01:58:26.92 --> 01:58:32.04
warfare. And there's doctrine designed about how to do it. That doctrine is written by

1209
01:58:32.04 --> 01:58:38.60
the crystals and madaces. Read that doctrine and cheat that way. Don't, don't do it, like, a 23-year-old

1210
01:58:38.60 --> 01:58:45.80
idiot. And there's 23-year-old friends. There's so many things you do not want to put your life

1211
01:58:46.36 --> 01:58:52.68
when you're, what, your life as a special operations guy at risk for anything. Like, for nothing.

1212
01:58:52.68 --> 01:58:58.84
So if you're in a, going to these, one of these selection courses, just take the high ground on

1213
01:58:58.84 --> 01:59:03.80
everything really. And if you don't, you get caught. And it's like, no one cares. Like, I, I don't

1214
01:59:03.80 --> 01:59:07.72
even even be talking you right now. You'd be, you'd have been like some random dude. I would

1215
01:59:07.72 --> 01:59:13.08
have gotten out of the army. Like, I think that's, yeah, I did civil affairs. Yeah, like, it's just,

1216
01:59:13.08 --> 01:59:19.16
don't do it. I wanted to throw that in there because, you know, I think it was for me, it was

1217
01:59:19.16 --> 01:59:25.24
like third phase in Buds where the instructor started saying, if you ain't cheating, you ain't

1218
01:59:25.24 --> 01:59:29.24
trying to bullshit. You're only cheating yourself. That's what they said now. I think about

1219
01:59:29.24 --> 01:59:34.92
they saying, you're only cheating yourself. And man, you don't want to get caught, brothers, too.

1220
01:59:34.92 --> 01:59:43.72
It's too awesome to be a part of the community, to, to risk it over something that made your life

1221
01:59:43.72 --> 01:59:48.68
a little bit easier for those days. Anyways, I had to throw that caveat in there. That's, big

1222
01:59:48.68 --> 01:59:59.08
exclamation mark. Context of time now. This is 2004. Like, we wanted war so bad. You know,

1223
01:59:59.08 --> 02:00:07.88
for sure, for sure. And, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if you're, if your thought process

1224
02:00:08.60 --> 02:00:12.12
was, I don't know what your thought process was. There's dudes, this is what it was. There's dudes

1225
02:00:12.12 --> 02:00:19.96
on horseback, fighting with a mucidine. Like, no, but my point is like, I, I, when I was going through

1226
02:00:19.96 --> 02:00:23.88
Buds, I like sat in my room on the weekends and sharpen my knife and polish my boots. Like, I could

1227
02:00:23.88 --> 02:00:27.88
go out drinking and like, dude, I was like, bro, I'm not risking anything. I'm not going to,

1228
02:00:27.88 --> 02:00:34.36
I'm just, I just want to make it through this shit. So, what was your, so I think we were

1229
02:00:34.36 --> 02:00:40.12
a product of their own creation during those four months in Saapsi where we had to learn how to

1230
02:00:40.12 --> 02:00:45.80
cheat in everything. We had, we had to reorganize our barracks. We had to, we went and stole

1231
02:00:45.80 --> 02:00:50.36
washing machines from other barracks of the 80s, and moved them so we could do more loads of laundry.

1232
02:00:50.36 --> 02:00:54.60
I went stole washing machines. We went, you know, there weren't enough beds for the number of

1233
02:00:54.60 --> 02:01:00.36
guys that came in. So we went to the 80s, and stole their beds out of their, their not occupied barracks.

1234
02:01:02.68 --> 02:01:06.92
If you watch like the original Green Brainy movie with John Wayne, one of the opening scenes,

1235
02:01:06.92 --> 02:01:11.16
they see, you see this, who you come in, and they're just stealing stuff from the supply yard.

1236
02:01:11.80 --> 02:01:17.80
And, like, that's what we're doing. You know, so, in, by Searschool, we had really refined

1237
02:01:17.80 --> 02:01:24.92
we had been cheating this whole entire time out of an essence of survival. And, and that was that

1238
02:01:24.92 --> 02:01:30.84
carried over negatively. There was a culture that had kind of been created and that, yeah, blood into the

1239
02:01:30.84 --> 02:01:35.80
next. Yeah, as a leader, be really careful about the culture that you create, because the byproduct of

1240
02:01:35.80 --> 02:01:40.12
the product of that you create in the environment that you build is going to be what you're going to

1241
02:01:40.12 --> 02:01:48.12
have to deal with. So, like, yes, you can make things so hard that sometimes the creation from this

1242
02:01:48.12 --> 02:01:53.08
environment, from this culture is going to be worse. Have you just changed what that culture was?

1243
02:01:57.08 --> 02:02:00.76
You got married? Yeah. What, what, when did you get married after, once you got your green

1244
02:02:00.76 --> 02:02:05.000
right, yeah, how did green Brainy, and then a couple of trips, got a couple of schools, and I was

1245
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:12.68
getting ready to go to Iraq. And that was, that's when the ginger finally conceded.

1246
02:02:13.88 --> 02:02:21.000
You broke her down, Siops. I know I did. It was, it was not, she went talk to me.

1247
02:02:21.80 --> 02:02:26.60
So, I had a, I just smart, she smart. So, I'd have to figure out who her pattern of life is,

1248
02:02:26.60 --> 02:02:31.000
like, what? I figured out who all her friends were, I'm a friend at all for friends, and then

1249
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.76
I figured out like, there's center of gravity, like where they went, and why they hung out there.

1250
02:02:34.76 --> 02:02:40.04
And I created, I fabricated environments that were where they would go to create opportunities

1251
02:02:40.04 --> 02:02:46.44
for me to go and find her and talk to her. And then ultimately, I, I created this event that was

1252
02:02:46.44 --> 02:02:52.44
like all the things that they love, live music, good food, wine, and, um, and I told them different

1253
02:02:52.44 --> 02:02:59.000
times. So, I, I told my principal, which is my wife, to be, to be there at one time, and I told

1254
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.32
all of her friends different times. So, then when she showed up 30 minutes late, but 30 minutes

1255
02:03:03.32 --> 02:03:08.44
before the rest of them came, which was an hour after I told her, um, I had already pre-planed

1256
02:03:08.44 --> 02:03:12.68
the text message to go out to all of them, like, oh, cancel. Don't worry about coming over,

1257
02:03:12.68 --> 02:03:16.52
and I tell her, oh, man, the, uh, nobody else has come and let's just go to dinner.

1258
02:03:16.52 --> 02:03:27.000
Oh, that was it. Siaps. Yeah. You get married. Um, and you get, you get put into the siff. That's right.

1259
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.20
Which is, again, now you're in 18x, right? Which means you haven't been in, in, in the regular army

1260
02:03:32.20 --> 02:03:39.000
at all. You've gone straight through school, and you get put into the siff, which is the commander's

1261
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.72
in extremist force, which is not only some more experience, guys. Yeah, it should be definitely.

1262
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:51.40
But you get thrown in there. Yeah. John McFee, uh, Sheriff Baghdad. He was a, he was a great

1263
02:03:51.40 --> 02:03:57.24
gag operator. Um, he is the team sergeant for this team. He had known me kind of from fighting,

1264
02:03:57.24 --> 02:04:03.16
and, um, he knew as, I, I don't know what his motivation was. Like he knew as a fighter. He knew

1265
02:04:03.16 --> 02:04:12.36
as a shooter, and they were looking for extra bodies to get ready to go to Iraq. And, um, so they,

1266
02:04:12.36 --> 02:04:20.04
he went and snagged me. It's pretty awesome. It's super awesome. But you're, so you got a good

1267
02:04:20.04 --> 02:04:24.44
reputation as a, like a fighter, and you're the honor graduate and all this other stuff, but you're

1268
02:04:24.44 --> 02:04:31.000
still a new guy showing up at a certain. Yeah. Still an FNG, uh, but a hungry, hungry bulldog.

1269
02:04:32.28 --> 02:04:36.60
Yeah. You, I imagine they were freaking stoked. Yeah. No.

1270
02:04:38.44 --> 02:04:43.80
It's wild that he, you know, he goes and gets me. I show up at the team room, and I'm standing in

1271
02:04:43.80 --> 02:04:47.56
front of the team room with my bags, and they're not letting me in. You know, I stand out in front of

1272
02:04:47.56 --> 02:04:52.84
that team room for a day, just standing there for like 10 hours. The door comes open, like, we told you to leave.

1273
02:04:52.84 --> 02:04:59.48
If, no, I was assigned to this team, like, well, we don't want you to go away. I stand there for

1274
02:04:59.48 --> 02:05:05.88
10 days or for 10 hours waiting to be let in. So, and they finally let you in. Finally let me in.

1275
02:05:05.88 --> 02:05:11.08
To go move the gym. Oh, yeah. They make you move the gym and then say, I don't like that

1276
02:05:11.08 --> 02:05:18.12
way. It looks now. Move back. Put, put it back. Um, and then you're deployed. You end up jumping

1277
02:05:18.12 --> 02:05:23.96
right into it, depending to a rack. Right away. Yeah. I get done with Sephardic, which is a required

1278
02:05:23.96 --> 02:05:30.60
school to be part of the the SIF and it's a three month long kind of hostage rescue direct action school.

1279
02:05:30.60 --> 02:05:38.92
And as soon as I graduate from that, I get on, Advon's already gone. PDS, PDS SES is kind of

1280
02:05:39.24 --> 02:05:43.64
complete. Advon's done. They're already in country. I get on this explain, playing with the team.

1281
02:05:43.64 --> 02:05:51.000
How freaking amped is Tim Kennedy at this juncture. I'm so happy. Yeah, I was like freaking

1282
02:05:51.72 --> 02:05:57.72
thrilled to one being the unit to have finished Sephardic so early. Like, that's a school that you

1283
02:05:57.72 --> 02:06:03.24
usually wait five, six years to be able to go to. I graduate from the Q-course. I go to Sephardic

1284
02:06:03.24 --> 02:06:07.96
and I report to the SIF. Like, this is wild. And then you know, you know, you're, you guys know

1285
02:06:07.96 --> 02:06:14.36
you're slotted to deploy. You know, we're deploying to. I don't. But they do. I haven't even,

1286
02:06:14.36 --> 02:06:18.92
I haven't even read in yet. You know, so I've no idea what anything is. I don't know where

1287
02:06:18.92 --> 02:06:23.48
the deployment is. I don't know where going. I don't know where mission is. So you get done with Sephardic

1288
02:06:23.48 --> 02:06:27.96
then you check into your team and how long to take for you to find out that you're going to

1289
02:06:27.96 --> 02:06:38.44
Iraq the three weeks. So this is now, so it's 2006. Yep. So Iraq is going off. It is crazy. Yeah.

1290
02:06:39.24 --> 02:06:44.60
You're, how do you get there? Do you fly? See 17. See 17, but where do you stop? You stop anywhere

1291
02:06:44.60 --> 02:06:48.68
on the way over? You must stop somewhere. Shannon in your fourth space, I think. And then you roll,

1292
02:06:48.68 --> 02:06:53.72
where do you land? You roll into Baghdad? Now we get a lot of all of a sudden. Yeah. Directed to all of

1293
02:06:53.72 --> 02:07:05.000
us on. And your Tim Kennedy has got to be as am to Tim Kennedy. Yeah. The combat approach of military

1294
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:12.12
aircraft into combat zone, it is not like a delta airlines. Please put up your tray, bring your seats

1295
02:07:12.12 --> 02:07:15.40
to an upright position and make sure that your seat belts are attached, that your bags are

1296
02:07:15.40 --> 02:07:19.48
underneath the seat in front of you. Like that's not what's happening. It's like this crazy

1297
02:07:19.48 --> 02:07:25.56
corkscrew circle as they drop from 30,000 feet down to land. And the final corkscrew is your

1298
02:07:25.56 --> 02:07:31.96
final approach. Like that's it. So as, you know, we have humvies, we have our trucks and all

1299
02:07:31.96 --> 02:07:37.64
of our pallets of guns and our connexes. And it's like, we hit the ground, the gate opens,

1300
02:07:37.64 --> 02:07:42.44
and you get hit with this hundred and something to green temperature in the dark of night.

1301
02:07:42.44 --> 02:07:45.16
And it was freaking amazing.

1302
02:07:45.16 --> 02:07:51.64
Yeah. First time I flew to Baghdad, I was with my potato, we're flying in. It's the same thing.

1303
02:07:51.64 --> 02:07:56.52
And I'm always like, I'm not going to show anybody any motions at all, whatever. I'm always

1304
02:07:56.52 --> 02:08:01.56
just like looking around. It's all good. And the plane starts going into that boat. And you're

1305
02:08:01.56 --> 02:08:05.72
like, we're like, get jerked around a little bit. And this one, buddy of mine, was like a

1306
02:08:06.76 --> 02:08:11.24
young and listed guy, but an awesome guy. He's like, got big guys. He looks like he goes,

1307
02:08:11.24 --> 02:08:16.60
these are evasive. I can't even say he's like, these are evasive maneuvers. And I go,

1308
02:08:16.60 --> 02:08:20.68
we'll be good. Something like just totally calm. Cool. Like, we'll be good. No factor. You know,

1309
02:08:20.68 --> 02:08:24.52
something like this, but I remember thinking, these are some evasive maneuvers. What's the

1310
02:08:24.52 --> 02:08:33.000
yeah? Yeah. We can just have it. Awesome. So you're on the ground, your, your mission and

1311
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.64
kind of the countries, a much of the country, certainly a lot of special operations at the time

1312
02:08:37.64 --> 02:08:45.08
was focused on getting AMZs. Yeah. Um, Zarkawi, he was the number one guy in Iraq for sure.

1313
02:08:45.08 --> 02:08:54.92
The number two, I underneath been modern. Um, but he was he was super hostile, super aggressive.

1314
02:08:55.80 --> 02:08:59.88
Been a lot. He passed off been modern. He was going so far. I mean, you got a good quote in the book.

1315
02:08:59.88 --> 02:09:05.24
I, something along the lines of, hey, when when Osama been modern is telling you, you need to calm

1316
02:09:05.24 --> 02:09:10.20
down. That's an indicator that you might be a little out of control. And that was Zarkawi for sure.

1317
02:09:10.20 --> 02:09:16.28
Mad man. Yeah. Um, violent, violent to a degree. We're pretty comfortable with violence.

1318
02:09:17.08 --> 02:09:23.16
Even now looking back, the things, the, the type of way that he, the tyranny that he put on both

1319
02:09:23.16 --> 02:09:29.16
Iraq's, the Iraqis and Americans. I mean, it, it was an extra special level of evil. Yeah. This is the

1320
02:09:29.16 --> 02:09:34.36
guy that was decapitating, um, you know, just on camera, disc cut and people's heads off,

1321
02:09:34.36 --> 02:09:42.92
Nick Berg. Uh, this guy's a, a, a hateful. It was the blackwater contractor capture, right? The

1322
02:09:42.92 --> 02:09:47.64
blackwater guy's that got burn alive. Yeah. The drag through the street. That was him. Um, the dudes that

1323
02:09:47.64 --> 02:09:53.72
were put in cages and burn like that was him. The, you know, drilling, screwing dudes hands to the walls.

1324
02:09:53.72 --> 02:09:58.60
So they could watch their families get tortured and murdered. That was him. Like he's nasty.

1325
02:09:58.60 --> 02:10:05.16
He's got a nice guy's an awful nasty dude, awful, excuse for human being. Uh, and so that's what you

1326
02:10:05.16 --> 02:10:09.96
guys are focused on. That's what much of special operations. And, and what, like this means going

1327
02:10:09.96 --> 02:10:13.48
after everyone is network, everyone that he touches, everyone that he, everything that he does

1328
02:10:13.48 --> 02:10:19.80
were watching, were tracking were trying to get a step ahead of them. Uh, your first up,

1329
02:10:20.52 --> 02:10:28.36
you going on a capture kill mission, some HVT, some high value target, you heal into the target,

1330
02:10:28.36 --> 02:10:33.56
you're approaching this enemy building. Um, I'm going to go to the book on this one because it's

1331
02:10:33.56 --> 02:10:44.44
pretty good. Uh, John, this John McFee, um, you say, John has us all move back about 100 meters.

1332
02:10:44.44 --> 02:10:49.32
Forms us into an L shaped ambush on the building and begins to call out. It's exactly what it sounds like.

1333
02:10:49.32 --> 02:10:53.88
We get on a megaphone. We start telling people to get out of the house within five minutes,

1334
02:10:53.88 --> 02:11:00.04
two guys and five women and their children leave. One of the women tells us her husband is still in

1335
02:11:00.04 --> 02:11:07.56
there. We ask him to get out for 15 minutes. It starts nice, but at the end, our turps is essentially

1336
02:11:07.56 --> 02:11:14.28
screaming get out of the house. Motherfucker, we're coming in to get you. He doesn't budge. We're going in.

1337
02:11:15.48 --> 02:11:22.20
The four of us walk to the front door as Dave Frederick's Ben Rios Mario Montes. So that

1338
02:11:22.20 --> 02:11:31.24
right? Yeah Montes. Montes. Montes. And many Vielovos move to the back door through the sheep's pen.

1339
02:11:31.24 --> 02:11:35.48
The rest of the guys are either hitting the other buildings or covering the windows of

1340
02:11:35.48 --> 02:11:42.28
outs just in case the guy tries to scort out. We're set. As the number one man,

1341
02:11:42.28 --> 02:11:47.64
out pulls the door open and eye is the number two man throwing a flashbang. John is the number three

1342
02:11:47.64 --> 02:11:52.68
man covers the doorway with his rifle in case someone tries to take a shot at me or Al as we do

1343
02:11:52.68 --> 02:11:58.20
our jobs. Bam, the flashbang goes off and we flow into the room one behind the other. We see a guy

1344
02:11:58.20 --> 02:12:02.52
sprint past the door. Our turps bils for the guy to get on the ground over and over again. The guy

1345
02:12:02.52 --> 02:12:09.40
is not going to the ground. He is defiant. My red dot is on his chest as our Al's and John's.

1346
02:12:10.36 --> 02:12:17.24
He takes a breath and makes an athletic movement away from us. I hear Al switches weapon from

1347
02:12:17.24 --> 02:12:22.36
safe to semi. It's such a small sound that the tiny click of metal on metal but all veterans know

1348
02:12:22.36 --> 02:12:28.76
what that sound means. It's go time. You can always hear it through flashbangs, through grenades,

1349
02:12:28.76 --> 02:12:33.96
through artillery. That little click engages the mechanism in your brain that tells you this event

1350
02:12:33.96 --> 02:12:40.60
is now real. My eyes see where this man is going and my brain slowly passes that message to my body.

1351
02:12:40.60 --> 02:12:48.20
He grabs an AK-47 and starts to spin towards us. Somewhere between the time he grabs for the gun

1352
02:12:48.20 --> 02:12:55.72
and the time he turns toward us with it, I move my weapon to semi as does John. By the time the man's

1353
02:12:55.72 --> 02:13:00.60
gun gets two thirds around the half circle from where he grabbed it to where he's pointed it

1354
02:13:00.60 --> 02:13:07.88
out. Al squeeze off one or two rounds. Mill a seconds later, I double tap the guy. John shoots him

1355
02:13:07.88 --> 02:13:13.24
almost the same time. I do also double tapping. The guy falls the ground lifeless. There are five,

1356
02:13:13.24 --> 02:13:19.16
maybe six holes stacked on top of each other through his heart. To be honest, if you don't look

1357
02:13:19.16 --> 02:13:25.08
carefully, it looks like one bullet wound. I just killed for the first time although I think Al's

1358
02:13:25.08 --> 02:13:29.72
round gets the actual credit but at the moment I'm actually impressed with how good we are.

1359
02:13:30.44 --> 02:13:35.000
I thought this would be a bigger moment. I thought it would have gravitas. It doesn't. He was a

1360
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.92
bad man. He tried to kill us. Now he's dead. It's that simple for me. What isn't simple is hearing

1361
02:13:40.92 --> 02:13:46.28
his wife screams when the shots ring out. There's no sound like the sound of a woman seeing

1362
02:13:46.28 --> 02:13:52.84
her husband die. It rattles me and lingers. We collect in-tarle off the entire building. We get blood

1363
02:13:52.84 --> 02:13:58.36
samples, fingerprints, face pictures and we take the body with us. There's a ton of valuable

1364
02:13:58.36 --> 02:14:04.60
intelligence here and this huge unexpected wind tactically. But his wife keeps screaming at us.

1365
02:14:04.60 --> 02:14:09.48
She's saying we murdered him. It doesn't matter to her that we gave the guy the opportunity to

1366
02:14:09.48 --> 02:14:15.08
leave the house. It doesn't matter that he tried to kill us. We killed her husband. I look at

1367
02:14:15.08 --> 02:14:22.28
the other men glaring at us. I look at the kids crying. Did we just make more terrace? Will these

1368
02:14:22.28 --> 02:14:28.60
kids grow up to try and kill more Americans? I probably would if I were them. The wife complains

1369
02:14:28.60 --> 02:14:32.84
enough that there's an immediate investigation of Al's decision to pull the trigger. This is a

1370
02:14:32.84 --> 02:14:38.76
huge shock to me. Isn't this war? This fucking guy was going to kill us. Nevertheless, the

1371
02:14:38.76 --> 02:14:43.96
sergeant major took statements from everyone. They did a forensic analysis of the shoot and concluded

1372
02:14:43.96 --> 02:14:48.12
that what we did, that what we said happened is exactly what happened to Al is cleared.

1373
02:14:48.84 --> 02:14:53.56
When we get back to the house, when we get back to the base, the guy's at blue tell us we did a great

1374
02:14:53.56 --> 02:14:58.84
job. They apparently watched the whole thing via satellite. Now there's a lot more trust. They don't

1375
02:14:58.84 --> 02:15:06.68
think we're idiots anymore. We're off to the races. Good way to kick it off.

1376
02:15:07.64 --> 02:15:15.24
Yeah, the it's weird though. It's weird in the sense that,

1377
02:15:16.12 --> 02:15:23.08
in a such flashbangs, you know, call out, when we're doing a call out, we're also flying

1378
02:15:23.08 --> 02:15:27.48
thrown flashbangs. You know, the guy at the house, the thruff flashbang in there,

1379
02:15:27.48 --> 02:15:33.88
you're on a microphone. This dude did pre-position weapons inside the house and he didn't know

1380
02:15:33.88 --> 02:15:39.16
which way we're going to come in. He was kind of squirting to where his designated fighting positions

1381
02:15:39.16 --> 02:15:45.72
were hoping to get us in hallways. Not bad. That's legit tactics on his part.

1382
02:15:46.60 --> 02:15:52.36
Clearly thought this through. Yeah, I mean, it's 2006. These guys have been working for a while.

1383
02:15:52.36 --> 02:15:59.32
Yeah, for him still be alive. He knows something. Yep. And, you know, in that rotation of

1384
02:16:00.44 --> 02:16:08.44
that half-second exposure, it's the book. And when the gun is seen is, or I mean,

1385
02:16:09.40 --> 02:16:15.24
you can't even touch how fast these things happen. You know, as he turns from around the corner,

1386
02:16:15.24 --> 02:16:18.92
you don't see anything until you essentially see the barrel and the barrel's already starting

1387
02:16:18.92 --> 02:16:24.12
to come up. So it's just like, and that's three people shooting at the same time. And

1388
02:16:27.48 --> 02:16:31.88
and then it's just, it's not movies. You know, it's not a dude flies back or there's,

1389
02:16:31.88 --> 02:16:37.32
there's just drops, just drops. And that's the end. And then you continue with your clearance.

1390
02:16:37.32 --> 02:16:43.24
Yep. Yeah, you step over that body and go to the next room. It's weird.

1391
02:16:43.24 --> 02:16:50.68
But you had to, after this op, you know, like you said, you start to build trust with the

1392
02:16:51.56 --> 02:16:56.68
blue that's there, which is the navy component. Sounds like it was a little bit of a rough start

1393
02:16:56.68 --> 02:17:02.92
with those guys, because they maybe didn't have the same level of trust with you guys before

1394
02:17:02.92 --> 02:17:09.96
this op or something. Um, this was C-37's first combat tour. Okay. So that, that, I think that

1395
02:17:09.96 --> 02:17:16.52
reservation was well-founded. And, you know, they, they, they, they're R-O-E, they're K-O-Cane,

1396
02:17:16.52 --> 02:17:22.28
and they're vertical K-O-Tart. They were looking for really specific targets. We just wanted

1397
02:17:22.28 --> 02:17:28.44
to get in the fight. You know, so they didn't want to use air assets at the expense of missing

1398
02:17:28.44 --> 02:17:34.52
an opportunity for a TST, which I also get, but then we just wanted to get a fight, you know.

1399
02:17:34.52 --> 02:17:38.60
So there, it was kind of priorities. They had already been there. They're, they're, they're working off

1400
02:17:38.60 --> 02:17:43.32
of, you, you, you, if you think like in the movies, you got this, this big wall, and you have the

1401
02:17:43.32 --> 02:17:47.64
tops are cowy, and then you have all of the targets, and you have clear lines of people that

1402
02:17:47.64 --> 02:17:53.48
might know him. You're really hoping for one of those to populate as a target. And if you

1403
02:17:53.48 --> 02:17:58.52
mean one of those, 332 other people that also need to die, and you're like, well take those,

1404
02:17:58.52 --> 02:18:05.000
yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but what expense, right? If 160, if we have two synops and four black

1405
02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.64
cocks, and we use all of them for this mission, then this dude that's like nine tears down,

1406
02:18:09.64 --> 02:18:14.20
and then somebody that's on tier three pops up, but we miss that one because, you know, we're

1407
02:18:14.20 --> 02:18:23.96
off doing something else, just to find work. So yeah. So you, you know, kick ass, that sounds cool,

1408
02:18:23.96 --> 02:18:30.52
but then what's interesting is the next night or the next stop, they like come up shy,

1409
02:18:30.52 --> 02:18:35.72
a helicopter, forever, I was a mechanical reasons, they got lit up, those helicopters getting

1410
02:18:35.72 --> 02:18:41.000
shot every night. So the next stop that you're supposed to go on, they're down on a helicopter,

1411
02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.72
so they can't take everybody, but they can kind of rework the forest list and get almost everybody

1412
02:18:45.72 --> 02:18:53.08
in there. So everyone's going on the opposite for one dude. Me, Tim Kennedy gets left behind. So

1413
02:18:53.08 --> 02:19:00.92
they go out and I can't even, this is like torture. This is the second op that they go on

1414
02:19:01.56 --> 02:19:06.84
and you don't go and you, you just feel like you're being tortured and you're sitting there,

1415
02:19:06.84 --> 02:19:10.68
getting ready for QRF and all this other stuff, but it's just freaking, yeah, so pissed.

1416
02:19:11.32 --> 02:19:18.52
In fact, you're so pissed. You're so pissed that when they get back, you pull

1417
02:19:18.52 --> 02:19:27.40
a McFey aside and you like beretem, like you, hey that was bad call bro, you know,

1418
02:19:27.40 --> 02:19:30.76
you should have taken your best your brightest. Dude, you literally haven't looked, you say,

1419
02:19:30.76 --> 02:19:35.40
you're a bad guy. You say, I'm the best shot the most physically fit and I dominated on that last

1420
02:19:35.40 --> 02:19:41.48
miss and I should have been the first to go, not the first to not go like that's the kind of

1421
02:19:41.48 --> 02:19:48.44
E5, I can't even, and E5, that's crazy. I've been out of the Q-course for two months. Or I've been

1422
02:19:48.44 --> 02:19:53.88
all the unit for two months, yeah, and an E5 is walking up to the master sergeant,

1423
02:19:53.88 --> 02:19:57.64
like listen, listen man, let me tell you what you should have done.

1424
02:19:59.64 --> 02:20:08.28
Let me tell you what you're wrong. Yeah, always. That's crazy. Yeah, all right,

1425
02:20:08.28 --> 02:20:14.52
hey man, props, you put it in the book, man. It's a good perspective for those young troopers out there,

1426
02:20:14.52 --> 02:20:19.56
man, it's good perspective because you can feel that way sometimes. You look at some guy like,

1427
02:20:19.56 --> 02:20:24.28
I should be going. And the worst honestly here's what socks, the worst way to get to go on the next

1428
02:20:24.28 --> 02:20:28.92
mission is to go to that person and say you should have put me on this mission first. It's like saying,

1429
02:20:28.92 --> 02:20:33.24
hey man, I think I deserve my purple belt now. Like don't do that. No, honestly, you're such a

1430
02:20:33.24 --> 02:20:41.96
bit of your mouth. Zip it, go in there and do work. Yeah. He goes old school though. And basically

1431
02:20:41.96 --> 02:20:46.76
says, all right, I'll tell you what, Kennedy, go grab your boxing gloves. We're going to settle this.

1432
02:20:47.96 --> 02:20:51.08
In which case, you're like, oh hell yeah, we're going to settle this. Why?

1433
02:20:53.96 --> 02:20:59.40
And he's a stud. John looks just like you. He's just a brick. You know, he's broad shoulders,

1434
02:20:59.40 --> 02:21:06.68
thick neck, you know, chunked ears. He's grappler. He's fighter. And I've seen pictures of him

1435
02:21:06.68 --> 02:21:11.88
and he looks like a beast of a dude. I don't care. I'm going to scuff that one guy up.

1436
02:21:13.32 --> 02:21:18.68
And unfortunately for you, he's not one guy. He's thinking gang food.

1437
02:21:19.64 --> 02:21:27.000
So I walk into that tent and into the whole team's there. Which should have just been such a lesson.

1438
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:33.16
He has such a moment where it's like, dude, my whole team is on the other side of the line.

1439
02:21:33.16 --> 02:21:36.76
I'm on this side of the line. But instead, I was like, dude, I'll show them.

1440
02:21:36.76 --> 02:21:40.92
Ah, show them what they're missing. You know, I got this part of that book right there.

1441
02:21:40.92 --> 02:21:46.52
Leadership, Schrodinger, and Tactics. The section of the book is called the conformed to influence.

1442
02:21:46.52 --> 02:21:50.28
And it's, I'm talking about when I was a new guy. Because Tim Kennedy, you wouldn't have a

1443
02:21:50.28 --> 02:21:57.000
freaking pat, not a feeling you're a jackass. I was a new guy. And I was like, you know, trying to be hardcore.

1444
02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.24
And like, people would be, we'd be going for a run. Our team would be going for run. I'd be like,

1445
02:22:01.24 --> 02:22:07.88
wearing boots, putting on a rucksack, running the O course with a rock on. And like, my, like, my

1446
02:22:07.88 --> 02:22:12.84
platoon mates. And I'm a new guy would be like, dude, hey, man, you need to chill out. And I'm just like,

1447
02:22:12.84 --> 02:22:17.16
maybe you need to be more hardcore. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, obviously, I'm freaking

1448
02:22:17.16 --> 02:22:21.24
hardcore over here. I got my rock on. I see you with a pair of running shoes on. What's up? You're

1449
02:22:21.24 --> 02:22:29.64
telling me what's up? No. And what I finally realized at a point, you know, like someone said,

1450
02:22:29.64 --> 02:22:34.44
hey, hey, Rambo, you need to chill out. And I was kind of like, it took me a minute to realize, oh,

1451
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.32
if I'm not part of this group, I have no influence over this group whatsoever. And I'll just be

1452
02:22:39.32 --> 02:22:45.16
ostracized and I won't be a part of this platoon. And when I realized that, I was like, okay, I get it.

1453
02:22:45.16 --> 02:22:50.20
And this is a classic example where it's like, when you're standing and you're looking at everyone

1454
02:22:50.20 --> 02:22:57.96
on your team, on the other side, that's, that's a signal to you, young trooper, you're in the wrong.

1455
02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.96
And look, you might be, you might be air quotes right about this particular item or that particular

1456
02:23:03.96 --> 02:23:09.40
item. But when there's 12 against one, you're making a mistake somehow. You're doing something wrong.

1457
02:23:09.40 --> 02:23:15.08
You're not building relationships like you should. And they line up on you and you go two minutes

1458
02:23:15.08 --> 02:23:19.72
two minute rounds with these dudes. Do do do I do pretty well for 10?

1459
02:23:20.28 --> 02:23:26.52
Start getting scuffed up the last two, Shane Thompson, good boxer beats me. Then John starts laying

1460
02:23:26.52 --> 02:23:31.88
it on me and I was like, all right, that wasn't so bad. Then I go back to number one and I go back

1461
02:23:31.88 --> 02:23:37.08
through the team again. And then the whole team, they just beat the brakes off me. One due to after

1462
02:23:37.08 --> 02:23:45.16
another and Tom sitting there, all that those tents, you have the whole thing's kind of plastic.

1463
02:23:45.16 --> 02:23:50.44
But you carry dust and Iraq has especially at all a saw and it's like this moon dust. So

1464
02:23:50.44 --> 02:23:57.16
there's this thin layer that's sitting on top of this plastic. So it's like the drool and the blood

1465
02:23:57.16 --> 02:24:01.64
is dripping out of my face and the sweat's coming off my forehead and it's hitting that moon dust.

1466
02:24:01.64 --> 02:24:12.28
I can see the white under plastic and it's this bright white of my blood and sweat and saliva

1467
02:24:12.28 --> 02:24:17.08
splashing in front of me as the rest of the team is just walking out and I'm just looking at my own

1468
02:24:17.08 --> 02:24:24.12
like drool. And again, this is one of those moments where in the book I'm like, oh cool,

1469
02:24:24.12 --> 02:24:29.88
he's going to get this lesson learned and you freely admit you're like, there was a lesson

1470
02:24:29.88 --> 02:24:35.88
be learned there. I did learn to teach you like to see it took those guys to round you to get me.

1471
02:24:37.08 --> 02:24:37.88
So dumb.

1472
02:24:42.52 --> 02:24:50.92
Man, um, but you continue doing ops and you guys sounds like you got a pretty good

1473
02:24:50.92 --> 02:25:00.84
uptempo going June 7th, 2006. You do this bit. There's like a whole, you know, almost AO wide series

1474
02:25:00.84 --> 02:25:06.52
of operations that's going on as they're getting closer and closer to actually figuring out

1475
02:25:06.52 --> 02:25:13.000
where's our coward is. Cags out, ranges are out. ICTF is out. You guys are hitting targets after

1476
02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:21.08
target, after target, um, AMZ finally gets tracked, you're building and they're four sponsons. Hey,

1477
02:25:21.08 --> 02:25:25.88
Zarkawe's dead. Uh, and what's interesting is I was, you know, you and I were talking about this

1478
02:25:25.88 --> 02:25:31.000
before we pressed record, but I was in Iraq at this time too. I think you got there in March and I

1479
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:39.40
got there in April. So that was a big deal when Zarkawe finally got killed. Yeah, pretty awesome.

1480
02:25:39.40 --> 02:25:45.32
I think I got wild for a couple of months after that too. Yeah, well, that's what I was going to say

1481
02:25:45.32 --> 02:25:54.60
is I, when Zarkawe got killed, I didn't think it would have any impact on the amount of

1482
02:25:54.60 --> 02:25:59.64
operations. I didn't think it would slow down the insurgents at all. And in fact, the insurgents

1483
02:25:59.64 --> 02:26:08.20
kind of went ham after this point. They really started going off. Uh, so it picked up, you know,

1484
02:26:08.20 --> 02:26:16.36
quite honestly. Yeah. And it sounds like it picked up for you guys, too. Yeah. How, how, how often

1485
02:26:16.36 --> 02:26:21.88
you guys going out every night, you know, when we left all of a sudden and we ended up in the green

1486
02:26:21.88 --> 02:26:29.56
zone, the international zone, in Baghdad proper, um, I mean, whether it was a gaffer a half,

1487
02:26:30.20 --> 02:26:34.12
whether we were being a ground assault force or a helicopter assault force. I mean, every night,

1488
02:26:34.12 --> 02:26:39.56
we were getting out and getting after it. I mean, you'd hear the ICTF half of our troop was

1489
02:26:40.84 --> 02:26:46.12
over with ICTF at a blood and you'd hear them in gun fights. And then we'd be on the other side of

1490
02:26:46.12 --> 02:26:50.28
the town, hit another target and then hear us in a gun fight. And then one of us would be calling

1491
02:26:50.28 --> 02:26:55.08
QRF and our QRF for a couple of Bradley's and the M1 Abrams. And that thing,

1492
02:26:55.72 --> 02:26:58.20
down the street, you hear that thing. Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't

1493
02:26:58.20 --> 02:27:02.76
most beautiful sound. I mean, you've ever heard is a Bradley rattle and into a building with

1494
02:27:02.76 --> 02:27:10.20
insurgents hiding inside of it. God bless the 25 millimeter tune gun.

1495
02:27:12.92 --> 02:27:17.88
So you get some good experience. Did you guys take any casualties on that opponent? No.

1496
02:27:17.88 --> 02:27:24.28
I mean, not a lick. You know, a couple of purple hearts that were kind of, kind of, kind of

1497
02:27:24.28 --> 02:27:29.80
give me, you know, like some shrapnel from a grenade that went off a ways away and like had a

1498
02:27:29.80 --> 02:27:37.32
due to hand. But like real no casualties. We're hammers. Yeah. And well, that's what's awesome.

1499
02:27:37.32 --> 02:27:42.20
You know, you got to have some level of luck, but when you're setting up these massive,

1500
02:27:42.20 --> 02:27:46.60
we offensive aggressive operations. A lot of times you're catching the enemy. Not ready for it.

1501
02:27:46.60 --> 02:27:50.68
No, which is exactly what you're doing. That speed surprised me by ounce of action. It's so

1502
02:27:50.68 --> 02:27:56.36
easy to say. Speed surprised me by ounce of action. But when you're on the receiving end of,

1503
02:27:56.36 --> 02:28:03.88
let's say a company, you know, of 60 soft special operations, guys, where every single

1504
02:28:03.88 --> 02:28:09.32
breach point of your building explodes at the same time simultaneously, every exterior breach point

1505
02:28:09.32 --> 02:28:13.80
shatters. Every window has something flying through it. And there's a gun getting stuck in every

1506
02:28:13.80 --> 02:28:17.88
single opening of entire building. And there's bodies coming through everything one of those exterior

1507
02:28:17.88 --> 02:28:24.04
doors. And an entire complex gets secured in a matter of eight seconds. It is there's, there's,

1508
02:28:24.04 --> 02:28:31.08
there's, there's nothing that you can do. There's nothing. Yeah. So good way to win, man.

1509
02:28:31.08 --> 02:28:37.000
Speed surprised and violence of action. So you get done with that deployment.

1510
02:28:38.60 --> 02:28:46.44
You fly back to America. You and your wife go, you know, you get your wife, you get some good food.

1511
02:28:46.44 --> 02:28:52.04
You're, you're still scanning for threats a little bit. You know, how was it dry? How was it driving

1512
02:28:52.04 --> 02:28:56.36
around? Like, I remember when I came back from my first deployment, we were in home visa all the time.

1513
02:28:56.36 --> 02:28:59.40
I was like driving around like, remember the bridges? Like it was like, oh, if you're going to

1514
02:28:59.40 --> 02:29:03.64
bring a test with you. And so like any car that's getting close, you're sort of getting that little like,

1515
02:29:03.64 --> 02:29:08.68
I'm about to freaking pit this dude off of her first shirt. You know, somebody doesn't use their

1516
02:29:08.68 --> 02:29:13.56
blank her. I'm like, it's a VBI. You know, and there's like a dead dog on the side of the road.

1517
02:29:13.56 --> 02:29:18.12
It's like, there's an ID plan in that dog. There's a, that's, that's a dead dog ball. I know that dog,

1518
02:29:18.12 --> 02:29:23.24
you know, I've seen that one before and I get a smell of trash and I immediately get flashback, you know,

1519
02:29:23.24 --> 02:29:28.28
if heaven forbid, I smell somebody smoking a clove or I drive by an Indian restaurant, I smell some curry,

1520
02:29:28.84 --> 02:29:33.56
you know, and that mixed with the fuel and exhaust of a vehicle, I'm boom, I'm right back in a combat.

1521
02:29:34.12 --> 02:29:40.60
It's wild. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cool. Yeah. But then what's what happens?

1522
02:29:40.60 --> 02:29:46.28
You get told, McFee tells you you're going to range your school. Yeah.

1523
02:29:47.40 --> 02:29:51.56
And he also says if you're not the on a grad of range school, you're out of,

1524
02:29:51.56 --> 02:29:59.32
Seth. That's right. How were you fired up for range of school? I was, it was,

1525
02:29:59.32 --> 02:30:02.28
there were other schools I wanted to go to. I wanted to go to sniper school. You know,

1526
02:30:02.28 --> 02:30:05.000
we're going to go to Halo school. I wanted to go to school, school,

1527
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:11.16
wanted to like to combat dive school. And so there are all these schools I wanted to go to. But the former

1528
02:30:11.16 --> 02:30:17.40
range of regiment team sergeant, again, here's another little clue into how useless and ignorant

1529
02:30:17.40 --> 02:30:22.84
and selfish and equal statistical I was as in this period. Like those are all my schools.

1530
02:30:22.84 --> 02:30:26.76
I was not even thinking how would it help, how would I become a better asset for my team? How

1531
02:30:26.76 --> 02:30:31.48
do I become, you know, as the new guy, a better leader? How do I understand the army a little bit better?

1532
02:30:31.48 --> 02:30:36.76
Yeah, there were, there were so many good schools that should have been on my list. And the very

1533
02:30:36.76 --> 02:30:41.80
first one as a wise new guy with a range of regiment, former range of regiment team sergeant,

1534
02:30:41.80 --> 02:30:45.72
like the first words out of my mouth should have been, I want to go to range of school team sergeant.

1535
02:30:45.72 --> 02:30:51.32
You know, not hey, I want to go to Halo school, like what I wanted to, what a bag of Dixia.

1536
02:30:52.04 --> 02:30:54.12
Yeah, in the seal teams,

1537
02:30:55.56 --> 02:30:59.48
often not 100% of time, oftentimes range of school is punishment.

1538
02:30:59.48 --> 02:31:05.32
It's, it's a, it's punishment. It's also a little bit of purgatory that you can redeem yourself.

1539
02:31:05.32 --> 02:31:10.12
So if you got a problem, if you've done something, if you've been off track,

1540
02:31:10.92 --> 02:31:15.64
they will send you to range of school. It's sort of like halfway punishment and also a

1541
02:31:15.64 --> 02:31:21.72
road to redemption. Jason Redmond, who's been on here, you know, he was, he was an enlisted guy,

1542
02:31:21.72 --> 02:31:30.12
became an officer and was not quite ready for it. And his redemption was all right,

1543
02:31:30.12 --> 02:31:33.08
you're a little jacked up. We're going to send you range of school. It's a great school.

1544
02:31:33.08 --> 02:31:36.76
You know, it's, it is a leadership school. I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what

1545
02:31:36.76 --> 02:31:42.68
range of school is. You think about the army rangeers, which is a special operations unit that

1546
02:31:42.68 --> 02:31:46.92
does really rad special operations things as a direct action force. And then you have range of

1547
02:31:46.92 --> 02:31:53.56
school, which is a really great leadership school. And as an 18x ray that has not even spent a day in

1548
02:31:53.56 --> 02:31:58.84
the regular army, like the one school I should have been raising my hand of go to is range of school.

1549
02:31:58.84 --> 02:32:04.12
And not as a punishment as like, I need this, you know, like this is who this not developed

1550
02:32:04.12 --> 02:32:11.56
soldier. This is what I now need. But that's not what I'm saying. So John's given John, you know,

1551
02:32:11.56 --> 02:32:16.52
like, and at the time, and I'm so mad at John and John, I've been talking since his book came out.

1552
02:32:16.52 --> 02:32:20.36
And, you know, he and I, you know, he's like, I may not have been the boss that you wanted, but you're

1553
02:32:20.36 --> 02:32:26.68
as the boss that you needed. And it's so true. He was such a great, great human. He's not a great human.

1554
02:32:26.68 --> 02:32:35.16
He was such a great leader that I needed. Before you go to range school, you go and compete

1555
02:32:35.16 --> 02:32:42.60
for the second time in the army, combatives, championship, and you win. Wild tournaments. The, uh,

1556
02:32:42.60 --> 02:32:47.96
I keep using the word wild because I don't know the, I mean, well, I think I'm, I've been using

1557
02:32:47.96 --> 02:32:51.64
that word a lot today too. So I think I started off the whole podcast talking about this wild

1558
02:32:51.64 --> 02:32:57.72
story about three, but yeah, wild. The tournament is a, is a, is a three day fight fest. You have

1559
02:32:57.72 --> 02:33:01.80
one day of grappling or you're going to, you're going to fight somewhere between five to 10 times

1560
02:33:01.80 --> 02:33:06.04
in one day. And the next day is pan craze. And you're going to fight if, if you're in the,

1561
02:33:06.04 --> 02:33:11.000
heaven forbid, forbid, you lose one grappling match and you're in the loser bracket for you to

1562
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.08
fight your way back into the winner's bracket. You're going to fight five or six times in, in full

1563
02:33:15.08 --> 02:33:22.28
MMA pan craze fights. So now you're somewhere between, I don't know, 10 to 15 fights by day two.

1564
02:33:22.28 --> 02:33:26.52
And then day three, they're, they're, they're full five minute three round fights.

1565
02:33:26.52 --> 02:33:31.52
15 minute fights day. Yeah.

1566
02:33:31.52 --> 02:33:31.52
Yeah.

1567
02:33:31.52 --> 02:33:32.52
Thank you.

1568
02:33:32.52 --> 02:33:37.52
Pan craze, they're going to open hand on the ground, open hand strike standing. What's, what's there?

1569
02:33:37.52 --> 02:33:44.52
Open palm to the face, close fist anywhere else, kicks anywhere and all submissions are in.

1570
02:33:44.52 --> 02:33:51.52
Yeah. And then day three is MMA for the championship, just, just MMA. Just MMA.

1571
02:33:51.52 --> 02:33:54.52
Just MMA. Gloves are no gloves. Gloves.

1572
02:33:54.52 --> 02:34:04.52
That's good question. Yeah. So, you know, again, peak war, peak like, warrior spirit, warrior ethos of the military.

1573
02:34:04.52 --> 02:34:08.52
Everybody could compete in this. You know, we had seals that were in it. We had marine guys that were in it.

1574
02:34:08.52 --> 02:34:15.52
And we had plenty of green braids, range regimen guys. Like this was the tournament of all tournaments within the military.

1575
02:34:15.52 --> 02:34:19.52
And this is your second one. When was the first one? The first one when I was in the Q course.

1576
02:34:19.52 --> 02:34:22.52
I used a roll about and one set down.

1577
02:34:22.52 --> 02:34:27.52
So, the chance of getting hurt in one of these fights and getting, you know, out of the Q course.

1578
02:34:27.52 --> 02:34:32.52
But one of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the slick.

1579
02:34:32.52 --> 02:34:37.52
Cadray, well, like, hey man, if, if you win this, I'll give you an, an arm, an arm, an achievement medal or something.

1580
02:34:37.52 --> 02:34:39.52
And I'll give you a three day weekend.

1581
02:34:39.52 --> 02:34:40.52
I'm in.

1582
02:34:40.52 --> 02:34:44.52
So, I go fight this. I get a medal. First of all, I get a medal.

1583
02:34:44.52 --> 02:34:46.52
The medals are cool. I don't have any of those.

1584
02:34:46.52 --> 02:34:48.52
And then I, then I get a three day weekend.

1585
02:34:48.52 --> 02:34:50.52
So, I did that. Well, we're fair.

1586
02:34:50.52 --> 02:34:52.52
Yeah, fair. No bad. No, no, no, no.

1587
02:34:52.52 --> 02:34:54.52
So, this is your second one.

1588
02:34:54.52 --> 02:34:58.52
Uh, that you win. You win this again. You became the first, I think the first person.

1589
02:34:58.52 --> 02:35:00.52
First person to do a slice back to back.

1590
02:35:00.52 --> 02:35:06.52
Uh, then you got a range of school. The same day.

1591
02:35:06.52 --> 02:35:11.52
What's the weight classes in the combat of the same as MMA? So, I fought a light heavyweight.

1592
02:35:11.52 --> 02:35:19.52
So, I fought 205, um, light heavyweight on Sunday was the light heavyweight championship.

1593
02:35:19.52 --> 02:35:22.52
So, MMA bout about 3 p.m. in the afternoon.

1594
02:35:22.52 --> 02:35:25.52
And I checked in to Ranger School at 6 p.m.

1595
02:35:25.52 --> 02:35:27.52
Credit.

1596
02:35:27.52 --> 02:35:29.52
Damn.

1597
02:35:29.52 --> 02:35:31.52
It's friggin awesome, man.

1598
02:35:31.52 --> 02:35:35.52
Uh, you, you go through Ranger School.

1599
02:35:35.52 --> 02:35:37.52
Um, in the book.

1600
02:35:37.52 --> 02:35:40.52
There's a lot of cool, cool details about it in the book.

1601
02:35:40.52 --> 02:35:43.52
Um, give me some highlights.

1602
02:35:43.52 --> 02:35:47.52
Wrap week. I mean, you must, it's weird that you're just like a combat experience.

1603
02:35:47.52 --> 02:35:51.52
Guy won the combat of tournament. Special forces, Sephardic,

1604
02:35:51.52 --> 02:35:53.52
15, and you're rolling into Ranger School.

1605
02:35:53.52 --> 02:35:53.52
Yeah.

1606
02:35:53.52 --> 02:35:56.52
The rank doesn't matter in Ranger School. That's pretty awesome.

1607
02:35:56.52 --> 02:35:57.52
Love it.

1608
02:35:57.52 --> 02:36:01.52
You go in Stripped. You know, so a staff sergeant, combat patch, special forces, airball.

1609
02:36:01.52 --> 02:36:03.52
That's, no, that's on there.

1610
02:36:03.52 --> 02:36:05.52
Right. I got my name tape.

1611
02:36:05.52 --> 02:36:06.52
That's why I got.

1612
02:36:06.52 --> 02:36:14.52
And, um, I know, that's one of the things that I love about the military is,

1613
02:36:14.52 --> 02:36:18.52
it is exclusively off merit.

1614
02:36:18.52 --> 02:36:19.52
Nothing.

1615
02:36:19.52 --> 02:36:22.52
I don't care your color. I don't care your religion.

1616
02:36:22.52 --> 02:36:25.52
I don't care anything about you. I care if you can do it.

1617
02:36:25.52 --> 02:36:28.52
Here's a very clear task condition in standard.

1618
02:36:28.52 --> 02:36:30.52
You're either capable of doing it or you're not.

1619
02:36:30.52 --> 02:36:32.52
You're either going to be a graduate if you're sniper school,

1620
02:36:32.52 --> 02:36:34.52
because you made this shot or you did it.

1621
02:36:34.52 --> 02:36:35.52
That's it.

1622
02:36:35.52 --> 02:36:36.52
Period.

1623
02:36:36.52 --> 02:36:39.52
And, and Ranger School is very defined in that way.

1624
02:36:39.52 --> 02:36:43.52
The, the grading for your patrols are very clear.

1625
02:36:43.52 --> 02:36:46.52
The grading for the, the physical portions are very clear.

1626
02:36:46.52 --> 02:36:49.52
The time requirements for you to make it through.

1627
02:36:49.52 --> 02:36:52.52
Um, the obstacle course are very clear.

1628
02:36:52.52 --> 02:36:54.52
Everything is just so clear.

1629
02:36:54.52 --> 02:36:57.52
Here's your time to distance someone reassemble the 240.

1630
02:36:57.52 --> 02:36:59.52
That's it.

1631
02:36:59.52 --> 02:37:00.52
Like you can do it.

1632
02:37:00.52 --> 02:37:01.52
You can't.

1633
02:37:01.52 --> 02:37:03.52
You view their, prepare and train.

1634
02:37:03.52 --> 02:37:05.52
And you know how it works or you don't.

1635
02:37:05.52 --> 02:37:07.52
And, um,

1636
02:37:07.52 --> 02:37:08.52
this.

1637
02:37:08.52 --> 02:37:10.52
And in between,

1638
02:37:10.52 --> 02:37:13.52
the,

1639
02:37:13.52 --> 02:37:16.52
the goal is the cadre is to show.

1640
02:37:16.52 --> 02:37:22.52
They use all of these gates as mechanisms to train somebody about how to lead.

1641
02:37:22.52 --> 02:37:23.52
They use, you know,

1642
02:37:23.52 --> 02:37:28.52
they have to tear down the person to see who that leader potentially could be.

1643
02:37:28.52 --> 02:37:31.52
Like anybody can be a good person when you're.

1644
02:37:31.52 --> 02:37:34.52
Well fed when you've had a great night's sleep.

1645
02:37:34.52 --> 02:37:36.52
You know, like when you've been hanging out with your wife.

1646
02:37:36.52 --> 02:37:38.52
Sure, I can go in there, you know,

1647
02:37:38.52 --> 02:37:41.52
and I see that they're also taking a really great time.

1648
02:37:41.52 --> 02:37:44.52
And I see that you're doing really great.

1649
02:37:44.52 --> 02:37:45.52
Great teamwork guys.

1650
02:37:45.52 --> 02:37:49.52
But what does it feel like when you have to volunteer.

1651
02:37:49.52 --> 02:37:52.52
To be up on another security shift because the dude just fell asleep and you're either going to be a good teammate.

1652
02:37:52.52 --> 02:37:54.52
Or you're not like, do you have that?

1653
02:37:54.52 --> 02:38:01.52
And by the way, all the people that you're leading are also sleep deprived, exhausted, tired, frustrated, pissed off and all that.

1654
02:38:01.52 --> 02:38:03.52
Yeah, when I joined the Navy.

1655
02:38:03.52 --> 02:38:04.52
The Marine Corps.

1656
02:38:04.52 --> 02:38:08.92
at that time, they didn't even have name tapes on their uniforms.

1657
02:38:08.92 --> 02:38:10.88
It was just like you were a Marine.

1658
02:38:10.88 --> 02:38:14.88
You were a freaking Lance Corpore or a Corpore or a Sergeant or that's what you were.

1659
02:38:14.88 --> 02:38:16.44
It was a freaking legit bird.

1660
02:38:16.44 --> 02:38:20.04
I remember thinking, I had so much respect for that.

1661
02:38:20.04 --> 02:38:23.72
I was like, oh hell yeah, Marine Corpore doesn't just, you're just a Marine.

1662
02:38:23.72 --> 02:38:24.72
You're a Marine.

1663
02:38:24.72 --> 02:38:26.72
Well, so you don't need a name.

1664
02:38:26.72 --> 02:38:28.32
Hey, Marine, get over here.

1665
02:38:28.32 --> 02:38:29.32
God, devil dogs.

1666
02:38:31.72 --> 02:38:34.12
One thing that you pointed out to the book that never,

1667
02:38:34.12 --> 02:38:40.12
it never, I never understood it until you explained it in the book.

1668
02:38:40.12 --> 02:38:43.72
And that is when you're in Ranger School, they call you Ranger.

1669
02:38:43.72 --> 02:38:44.72
Yeah.

1670
02:38:44.72 --> 02:38:50.72
And I always thought that was backwards, you know, like that, hey, you're not a Ranger yet.

1671
02:38:50.72 --> 02:38:51.72
You're in school.

1672
02:38:51.72 --> 02:38:55.12
So why would they be calling you Ranger and the way you explained it?

1673
02:38:55.12 --> 02:38:57.52
The fact that you were watching a guy quit.

1674
02:38:57.52 --> 02:38:59.12
He's quitting pretty deep into Ranger School.

1675
02:38:59.12 --> 02:39:01.12
He was going to be like 30, 40 days into it.

1676
02:39:01.12 --> 02:39:05.12
We're in Mountain Face.

1677
02:39:05.12 --> 02:39:06.12
Two faces in half way through it.

1678
02:39:06.12 --> 02:39:08.12
And this guy decides to quit.

1679
02:39:08.12 --> 02:39:10.12
And you were called.

1680
02:39:10.12 --> 02:39:11.12
You know that?

1681
02:39:11.12 --> 02:39:12.12
Yeah.

1682
02:39:12.12 --> 02:39:13.12
Cold, cold gets you.

1683
02:39:13.12 --> 02:39:14.12
Cold gets you.

1684
02:39:14.12 --> 02:39:15.12
Cold gets you.

1685
02:39:15.12 --> 02:39:17.12
Yeah, you're used to it.

1686
02:39:17.12 --> 02:39:21.12
But you were listening to the instructors kind of take them aside.

1687
02:39:21.12 --> 02:39:24.12
And they start calling him by his name and by his rank.

1688
02:39:24.12 --> 02:39:27.12
And they're not calling him Ranger anymore.

1689
02:39:27.12 --> 02:39:30.12
And I was like, oh, damn.

1690
02:39:30.12 --> 02:39:32.12
I never heard it before.

1691
02:39:32.12 --> 02:39:35.12
You know, when you quit, you just disappear in like rap week.

1692
02:39:35.12 --> 02:39:36.12
You're just going.

1693
02:39:36.12 --> 02:39:38.12
But there, you're on this ambush line.

1694
02:39:38.12 --> 02:39:41.12
You know, and it's been Ranger this Ranger that sometimes.

1695
02:39:41.12 --> 02:39:43.12
But usually like a Ranger get over here.

1696
02:39:43.12 --> 02:39:47.12
And when they're like, hey, Sergeant Smith come here.

1697
02:39:47.12 --> 02:39:50.12
And I was like, oh, what the fuck?

1698
02:39:50.12 --> 02:39:52.12
I would have been like, dude, I'm sorry.

1699
02:39:52.12 --> 02:39:54.12
I'm going back in that patrol right now.

1700
02:39:54.12 --> 02:39:55.12
I don't care.

1701
02:39:55.12 --> 02:39:56.12
Yeah.

1702
02:39:56.12 --> 02:39:59.12
Well, it makes people quit in Ranger School.

1703
02:39:59.12 --> 02:40:04.12
So, I think self selection is the biggest a trader.

1704
02:40:04.12 --> 02:40:06.12
People literally just quitting.

1705
02:40:06.12 --> 02:40:12.12
And it is the environment's not rough.

1706
02:40:12.12 --> 02:40:19.12
You know, at Georgia, Benny, it is a great conducive environment for you learn how to do basic patroling.

1707
02:40:19.12 --> 02:40:21.12
Mountain phase.

1708
02:40:21.12 --> 02:40:28.12
I think it's the accumulation of you, you start internalizing all of these things that you're going to have.

1709
02:40:28.12 --> 02:40:31.12
And it seems this, this, this, this daunting task.

1710
02:40:31.12 --> 02:40:33.12
Like, I can't, I have to get this, these, these patrols,

1711
02:40:33.12 --> 02:40:34.12
I have to get through these patrols.

1712
02:40:34.12 --> 02:40:36.12
I have to make it through these events.

1713
02:40:36.12 --> 02:40:37.12
I have to do this time to think.

1714
02:40:37.12 --> 02:40:38.12
I have to do this rock.

1715
02:40:38.12 --> 02:40:42.12
And here's like, look at it from start to finish.

1716
02:40:42.12 --> 02:40:47.12
The deeper into it you go, the fewer and fewer quidters you get.

1717
02:40:47.12 --> 02:40:53.12
And it's not because it's any less hard because it is, it gets harder as it goes.

1718
02:40:53.12 --> 02:41:00.12
It's because there's less tasks in front of you.

1719
02:41:00.12 --> 02:41:04.12
So people are staring at the giant weight of all these tasks that I can't take it.

1720
02:41:04.12 --> 02:41:08.12
They get tired, they get cold, and they look at this long list of things that they have to be able to do.

1721
02:41:08.12 --> 02:41:12.12
And then I got, I just can't do it.

1722
02:41:12.12 --> 02:41:17.12
Yeah, but the, when you were talking about sopcy.

1723
02:41:17.12 --> 02:41:20.12
At a certain point, there's this like nothing you can do to make these kids quit.

1724
02:41:20.12 --> 02:41:21.12
Nothing.

1725
02:41:21.12 --> 02:41:26.12
Like they get kids done with how weak and you're like,

1726
02:41:26.12 --> 02:41:28.12
You could tell them to do anything.

1727
02:41:28.12 --> 02:41:29.12
They don't care anymore about anything.

1728
02:41:29.12 --> 02:41:34.12
They're just like, you can just, you can just, we injure them with baseball bats or something.

1729
02:41:34.12 --> 02:41:36.12
But other than that, they're going to keep moving forward a little bit.

1730
02:41:36.12 --> 02:41:38.12
I have a Bengal tiger and a cage over there.

1731
02:41:38.12 --> 02:41:40.12
If you want to graduate, you're going to go fight it.

1732
02:41:40.12 --> 02:41:41.12
Yep.

1733
02:41:41.12 --> 02:41:42.12
Cool.

1734
02:41:42.12 --> 02:41:46.12
I mean, how much weight did you lose?

1735
02:41:46.12 --> 02:41:48.12
It's so zero.

1736
02:41:48.12 --> 02:41:49.12
In range of school.

1737
02:41:49.12 --> 02:41:51.12
You lost zero weight.

1738
02:41:51.12 --> 02:41:52.12
I lost no weight in range of.

1739
02:41:52.12 --> 02:41:53.12
The average weight loss is what?

1740
02:41:53.12 --> 02:41:54.12
25 pounds?

1741
02:41:54.12 --> 02:41:58.12
Yeah, I can't get 10% of your body weight is what you typically lose.

1742
02:41:58.12 --> 02:42:02.12
And you, you set up basically a system of kicking ass and taking MREs.

1743
02:42:02.12 --> 02:42:03.12
That's it.

1744
02:42:03.12 --> 02:42:04.12
I'm like that.

1745
02:42:04.12 --> 02:42:06.12
We should make it a shirt of that.

1746
02:42:06.12 --> 02:42:09.12
So staff sergeant combat SF graduates,

1747
02:42:09.12 --> 02:42:12.12
if the West Point kid, you know,

1748
02:42:12.12 --> 02:42:14.12
APL, he walks up to me as a Tim.

1749
02:42:14.12 --> 02:42:16.12
I need to go on this.

1750
02:42:16.12 --> 02:42:19.12
Can you do this?

1751
02:42:19.12 --> 02:42:20.12
Yes, I can.

1752
02:42:20.12 --> 02:42:21.12
How want your main meal?

1753
02:42:21.12 --> 02:42:22.12
Your crackers.

1754
02:42:22.12 --> 02:42:23.12
I'll carry the 240.

1755
02:42:23.12 --> 02:42:26.12
I'll go ahead and I'll be like, you know, you're, you're kind of like,

1756
02:42:26.12 --> 02:42:29.12
up support sergeant and I'll walk the line.

1757
02:42:29.12 --> 02:42:30.12
I don't need sleep.

1758
02:42:30.12 --> 02:42:31.12
I can do extra work.

1759
02:42:31.12 --> 02:42:33.12
I can go for forever.

1760
02:42:33.12 --> 02:42:35.12
You got to feed the beast.

1761
02:42:35.12 --> 02:42:37.12
And so like if you wanted to go,

1762
02:42:37.12 --> 02:42:39.12
it was fair.

1763
02:42:39.12 --> 02:42:41.12
You know, as I peered number one on everything.

1764
02:42:41.12 --> 02:42:44.12
Like, and peering is another big a trigger.

1765
02:42:44.12 --> 02:42:47.12
And every single phase you grade one through 12 or one through 13,

1766
02:42:47.12 --> 02:42:48.12
13 gets cut.

1767
02:42:48.12 --> 02:42:51.12
And so the top 12 guys kind of stay.

1768
02:42:51.12 --> 02:42:53.12
But that, that baggage carries over with you.

1769
02:42:53.12 --> 02:42:57.12
So, you know, I was peering top the list because I was doing all the work.

1770
02:42:57.12 --> 02:42:59.12
But guys knew that there was a price to pay.

1771
02:42:59.12 --> 02:43:03.12
And that was the peanut butter or that made me a little.

1772
02:43:03.12 --> 02:43:06.12
And they must have been really needing your help.

1773
02:43:06.12 --> 02:43:07.12
Because they're starving.

1774
02:43:07.12 --> 02:43:09.12
You get a one on one, one MRG there, right?

1775
02:43:09.12 --> 02:43:12.12
Yeah, you get a no go on a patrol.

1776
02:43:12.12 --> 02:43:14.12
You got to get a go.

1777
02:43:14.12 --> 02:43:17.12
You know, if you get, and then the catarist comes up to you,

1778
02:43:17.12 --> 02:43:21.12
hey, you're going to be the, you know, you're going to be the peel on this next patrol.

1779
02:43:21.12 --> 02:43:23.12
If you don't get a go on there, you get a second no go.

1780
02:43:23.12 --> 02:43:24.12
Like you're at a ranger school.

1781
02:43:24.12 --> 02:43:25.12
No go ranger.

1782
02:43:25.12 --> 02:43:26.12
Yeah.

1783
02:43:26.12 --> 02:43:29.12
So, you know, they, hey man, I just got my patrol.

1784
02:43:29.12 --> 02:43:31.12
I got a no go on my last patrol.

1785
02:43:31.12 --> 02:43:32.12
What do I need to do?

1786
02:43:32.12 --> 02:43:33.12
Gotcha.

1787
02:43:33.12 --> 02:43:34.12
Yeah.

1788
02:43:34.12 --> 02:43:36.12
You know, first, give me that hand voice.

1789
02:43:36.12 --> 02:43:39.12
First, you pay the type of.

1790
02:43:39.12 --> 02:43:40.12
That's incredible.

1791
02:43:40.12 --> 02:43:42.12
How do you think you'd get like three,

1792
02:43:42.12 --> 02:43:44.12
at main meals a day?

1793
02:43:44.12 --> 02:43:45.12
At least.

1794
02:43:45.12 --> 02:43:46.12
Yeah.

1795
02:43:46.12 --> 02:43:47.12
Really?

1796
02:43:47.12 --> 02:43:49.12
Yeah, I mean, so they're, you know, two or three patrols a day.

1797
02:43:49.12 --> 02:43:54.12
And I was probably stepping up to two or one or two patrols a day.

1798
02:43:54.12 --> 02:43:57.12
So I'd get an extra one or two every day.

1799
02:43:57.12 --> 02:43:58.12
Yeah.

1800
02:43:58.12 --> 02:43:59.12
Oh, no.

1801
02:43:59.12 --> 02:44:01.12
Again, I just kind of, I can't go and put down the book.

1802
02:44:01.12 --> 02:44:03.12
Cause I don't know, man.

1803
02:44:03.12 --> 02:44:06.12
I, you probably helped a lot of people.

1804
02:44:06.12 --> 02:44:08.12
I mean, that's hard.

1805
02:44:08.12 --> 02:44:11.12
And people wouldn't be giving up their food unless they really needed it.

1806
02:44:11.12 --> 02:44:12.12
You know, they got their ghosts.

1807
02:44:12.12 --> 02:44:14.12
I, I, I batted a thousand.

1808
02:44:14.12 --> 02:44:15.12
Did it?

1809
02:44:15.12 --> 02:44:17.12
No, if, if you give me your main meal, you're getting to go.

1810
02:44:17.12 --> 02:44:18.12
No.

1811
02:44:18.12 --> 02:44:19.12
No.

1812
02:44:19.12 --> 02:44:21.12
Dude, we'll work for food.

1813
02:44:21.12 --> 02:44:23.12
I walked up.

1814
02:44:23.12 --> 02:44:27.12
If, if like, some dude was, let's say we just had a.

1815
02:44:27.12 --> 02:44:30.12
React contact or we had to go set up an ambush.

1816
02:44:30.12 --> 02:44:34.12
And I went to patrol line and there was, they were not that they're scared of me.

1817
02:44:34.12 --> 02:44:37.12
But if they saw me coming, I mean, they're, they're on their gun.

1818
02:44:37.12 --> 02:44:38.12
Like, because they know it's coming.

1819
02:44:38.12 --> 02:44:43.12
Like, the dude is going to get a go or Tim's going to have his attempt going to take

1820
02:44:43.12 --> 02:44:44.12
a pound of flesh.

1821
02:44:44.12 --> 02:44:49.12
Dude, you must be the first, first dude to not lose weight in range of school.

1822
02:44:49.12 --> 02:44:50.12
That's amazing.

1823
02:44:50.12 --> 02:44:55.12
So when I graduated, I fought a fight for the AFL a couple of days later.

1824
02:44:55.12 --> 02:44:57.12
And, um, and I fought at as, as a light heavyweight.

1825
02:44:57.12 --> 02:45:00.12
And I had a cut weight to make light heavyweight.

1826
02:45:00.12 --> 02:45:04.12
So I know I fought light heavyweight when I went into range of school on Sunday.

1827
02:45:04.12 --> 02:45:08.12
And then I graduated and I fought the following weekend at light heavyweight.

1828
02:45:08.12 --> 02:45:10.12
So there you go.

1829
02:45:10.12 --> 02:45:13.12
I did put on the range of pounds right after graduate research.

1830
02:45:13.12 --> 02:45:14.12
It's like, errrr.

1831
02:45:14.12 --> 02:45:15.12
It's shocking everything.

1832
02:45:15.12 --> 02:45:17.12
And you ended up being the on-of-grad.

1833
02:45:17.12 --> 02:45:19.12
Yep.

1834
02:45:19.12 --> 02:45:24.12
And you say you go back and you want to throw it in McPhase face like you see, you don't

1835
02:45:24.12 --> 02:45:25.12
stain it, see if it's going.

1836
02:45:25.12 --> 02:45:27.12
Look, I did it and he's not even there.

1837
02:45:27.12 --> 02:45:29.12
Not there, you already moved on, bro.

1838
02:45:29.12 --> 02:45:32.12
So he's, psychological warfare to you.

1839
02:45:32.12 --> 02:45:33.12
Yes, again.

1840
02:45:33.12 --> 02:45:34.12
You couldn't just go to range of school.

1841
02:45:34.12 --> 02:45:39.12
You had to graduate on or grad, which was extra all kinds of extra work, because the difference

1842
02:45:39.12 --> 02:45:43.12
between like passing and being number one, the difference amount of work is huge.

1843
02:45:43.12 --> 02:45:46.12
Yeah, I get back to the team and he's like, right, right.

1844
02:45:46.12 --> 02:45:47.12
That crickets.

1845
02:45:47.12 --> 02:45:49.12
There's nobody there.

1846
02:45:49.12 --> 02:45:53.12
And then four days later, four days after range of school you get in this fight.

1847
02:45:53.12 --> 02:45:57.12
You get this fight for the AFL, the international fight league.

1848
02:45:57.12 --> 02:45:58.12
Yeah.

1849
02:45:58.12 --> 02:46:03.12
Normally, normally you take months to recover from range of school.

1850
02:46:03.12 --> 02:46:05.12
You guys aren't walking right.

1851
02:46:05.12 --> 02:46:09.12
You don't have to take a P.T. test for sometimes six months to a year.

1852
02:46:09.12 --> 02:46:13.12
And your body is a digestive system's trashed and energy.

1853
02:46:13.12 --> 02:46:19.12
What was your digestive system like after that many days of just MREs?

1854
02:46:19.12 --> 02:46:27.12
This is, um, if the dad graduated, um, I wanted to attack my wife.

1855
02:46:27.12 --> 02:46:28.12
I wanted to kill an elk.

1856
02:46:28.12 --> 02:46:31.12
I wanted to find her and I wanted to fight a vlosser after her.

1857
02:46:31.12 --> 02:46:33.12
Like that, that's the energy I had when I got done.

1858
02:46:33.12 --> 02:46:37.12
I was like, I want to be back, you know, the team sergeant Ed Weems was like, you know,

1859
02:46:37.12 --> 02:46:42.12
take a week off, come back to the team next Monday and I was like, no, you know, what

1860
02:46:42.12 --> 02:46:43.12
are we doing this week?

1861
02:46:43.12 --> 02:46:47.12
He's like, take a week off and come back on Monday.

1862
02:46:47.12 --> 02:46:49.12
Then my phone rings and they get a fight and it's like,

1863
02:46:49.12 --> 02:46:51.12
ah, take that Ed.

1864
02:46:51.12 --> 02:46:53.12
I'm gonna go fight and I FL fight.

1865
02:46:53.12 --> 02:46:59.12
You win, you win your fight in the IFL.

1866
02:46:59.12 --> 02:47:04.12
And again, you got to cool details and anybody that's any kind of remote fan of MMA at all,

1867
02:47:04.12 --> 02:47:11.12
or actually sports in general, the freaking book has some kick ass details on what's going on behind

1868
02:47:11.12 --> 02:47:12.12
this scene.

1869
02:47:12.12 --> 02:47:16.12
There's so much that's happening besides what you see on the 15 minutes on TV,

1870
02:47:16.12 --> 02:47:18.12
which is awesome.

1871
02:47:18.12 --> 02:47:21.12
You end up going to soda the special operations target,

1872
02:47:21.12 --> 02:47:23.12
the introduction school, the sniper school.

1873
02:47:23.12 --> 02:47:25.12
This was wild.

1874
02:47:25.12 --> 02:47:27.12
You're going through that.

1875
02:47:27.12 --> 02:47:31.12
You're doing your last pass fail evolution.

1876
02:47:31.12 --> 02:47:34.12
It's a field shot that you have to take.

1877
02:47:34.12 --> 02:47:36.12
Your partner freaking quits.

1878
02:47:36.12 --> 02:47:37.12
Yeah.

1879
02:47:37.12 --> 02:47:38.12
You're shooting partner quits.

1880
02:47:38.12 --> 02:47:40.12
So sniper is a two man thing.

1881
02:47:40.12 --> 02:47:42.12
It seems like it's a one man thing, but it's actually a two man thing.

1882
02:47:42.12 --> 02:47:44.12
You need someone to call the wind and call the shop for you.

1883
02:47:44.12 --> 02:47:49.12
And your partner, the last day of this freaking course decides to quit.

1884
02:47:49.12 --> 02:47:52.12
God bless this soul.

1885
02:47:52.12 --> 02:47:56.12
He has Karen some baggage.

1886
02:47:56.12 --> 02:47:58.12
He had a lot of traumatic stress.

1887
02:47:58.12 --> 02:48:00.12
I think she's working through.

1888
02:48:00.12 --> 02:48:03.12
He ultimately died in a training event.

1889
02:48:03.12 --> 02:48:04.12
Oh, horrible.

1890
02:48:04.12 --> 02:48:06.12
And he burnt in on Halo.

1891
02:48:06.12 --> 02:48:07.12
Jump.

1892
02:48:07.12 --> 02:48:10.12
And you know, there's Jack.

1893
02:48:10.12 --> 02:48:11.12
It's hard.

1894
02:48:11.12 --> 02:48:14.12
Stands up.

1895
02:48:14.12 --> 02:48:15.12
Just quits.

1896
02:48:15.12 --> 02:48:16.12
He quits.

1897
02:48:16.12 --> 02:48:22.12
So now you're now, but the cadre says, all right, you know, Kennedy's partner quit.

1898
02:48:22.12 --> 02:48:25.12
Who wants to who wants their call form.

1899
02:48:25.12 --> 02:48:29.12
And the caveat is that Kennedy's getting one shot.

1900
02:48:29.12 --> 02:48:31.12
Then structure's going to choose the shot from the field.

1901
02:48:31.12 --> 02:48:33.12
He's going to pick whatever one.

1902
02:48:33.12 --> 02:48:38.12
And whether Kennedy passes or fails is on you as, you know, call for.

1903
02:48:38.12 --> 02:48:40.12
So you're sitting there like looking up.

1904
02:48:40.12 --> 02:48:41.12
Everyone else is done.

1905
02:48:41.12 --> 02:48:42.12
Everyone's done.

1906
02:48:42.12 --> 02:48:43.12
They're done.

1907
02:48:43.12 --> 02:48:44.12
They don't have to do any more shit.

1908
02:48:44.12 --> 02:48:46.12
And you're looking up there.

1909
02:48:46.12 --> 02:48:49.12
You're like, seen who's going to who's going to hook it up for you.

1910
02:48:49.12 --> 02:48:51.12
And I got to go to the book on this book.

1911
02:48:51.12 --> 02:48:52.12
It's pretty funny.

1912
02:48:52.12 --> 02:48:54.12
You say, I scan the bleachers.

1913
02:48:54.12 --> 02:48:56.12
I know my chances are not good.

1914
02:48:56.12 --> 02:48:57.12
Who would want to do that?

1915
02:48:57.12 --> 02:48:58.12
But I don't wait long.

1916
02:48:58.12 --> 02:49:02.12
A burly Asian on the far left side stands up immediately.

1917
02:49:02.12 --> 02:49:04.12
Picture the Batman costume, but Asian.

1918
02:49:04.12 --> 02:49:06.12
And that's basically my clever.

1919
02:49:06.12 --> 02:49:08.12
This dude, is it worried at all?

1920
02:49:08.12 --> 02:49:12.12
He walks over like he's about to choose a salad dressing and a salad bar.

1921
02:49:12.12 --> 02:49:17.12
He's looking at the dressing and not making the decision that will affect whether I pass or fail.

1922
02:49:17.12 --> 02:49:24.12
What if I put your graduation on the line, Glover, the sergeant asks, I'm making the same decision, Sergeant Glover response.

1923
02:49:24.12 --> 02:49:26.12
I like this guy.

1924
02:49:26.12 --> 02:49:31.12
Well, I guess it's lucky we aren't doing that to you, Glover.

1925
02:49:31.12 --> 02:49:35.12
The country take one round out and place it in a little ditch,

1926
02:49:35.12 --> 02:49:40.12
proforing it to us like they're serving the dessert at a fine dining establishment.

1927
02:49:40.12 --> 02:49:43.12
If you get a first round hit on our target, Kennedy, you graduate.

1928
02:49:43.12 --> 02:49:46.12
If you don't, you fail a sniper school.

1929
02:49:46.12 --> 02:49:49.12
They choose the 788 meter target.

1930
02:49:49.12 --> 02:49:52.12
It's the furthest one from our position.

1931
02:49:52.12 --> 02:49:55.12
Michael looks at it very quickly and gives me the adjustment.

1932
02:49:55.12 --> 02:49:57.12
His confidence in speed scares me a little.

1933
02:49:57.12 --> 02:50:00.12
I'm not used to it after spending the whole course with my partner.

1934
02:50:00.12 --> 02:50:01.12
Are you sure?

1935
02:50:01.12 --> 02:50:02.12
I ask calmly.

1936
02:50:02.12 --> 02:50:04.12
Micropedes exact the win call he just said.

1937
02:50:04.12 --> 02:50:07.12
I make his adjustments and squeeze the trigger.

1938
02:50:07.12 --> 02:50:11.12
I see the impact and then a second later, here's the ping.

1939
02:50:11.12 --> 02:50:15.12
Dead on balls, mother fucking accurate.

1940
02:50:15.12 --> 02:50:17.12
Micropedes on the back and says good job.

1941
02:50:17.12 --> 02:50:18.12
That was it.

1942
02:50:18.12 --> 02:50:20.12
I can glove her dude.

1943
02:50:20.12 --> 02:50:22.12
Come it in hot.

1944
02:50:22.12 --> 02:50:24.12
That's awesome.

1945
02:50:24.12 --> 02:50:26.12
So.

1946
02:50:26.12 --> 02:50:29.12
Mic is a rare soul.

1947
02:50:29.12 --> 02:50:30.12
Yeah, he's awesome.

1948
02:50:30.12 --> 02:50:33.12
He's he's a fierce passionate human.

1949
02:50:33.12 --> 02:50:35.12
He's also uncompromising.

1950
02:50:35.12 --> 02:50:36.12
Yeah, he did.

1951
02:50:36.12 --> 02:50:41.12
I don't think they're there something with him or he doesn't know how to back down to any fight.

1952
02:50:41.12 --> 02:50:45.12
You know, whether he's like being censored on social media, he just doubles down.

1953
02:50:45.12 --> 02:50:50.12
You know, if, you know, and some of these schools there were times where there,

1954
02:50:50.12 --> 02:50:56.12
they would question, you know, he's he's he's he's he's another sick guy coming back from a combat deployment and you know,

1955
02:50:56.12 --> 02:50:59.12
maybe they're questioning an approach that he had doing.

1956
02:50:59.12 --> 02:51:00.12
He's like, no, no, this is right.

1957
02:51:00.12 --> 02:51:01.12
You're wrong.

1958
02:51:01.12 --> 02:51:03.12
They never he would just not back down.

1959
02:51:03.12 --> 02:51:11.12
And I understood it there when they there there is a moment where they say, hey, what if we put your graduation on the line, he waits.

1960
02:51:11.12 --> 02:51:13.12
He's like, that one changed my answer.

1961
02:51:13.12 --> 02:51:14.12
Not a minute.

1962
02:51:14.12 --> 02:51:16.12
He just stands there.

1963
02:51:16.12 --> 02:51:19.12
And then they're like, okay, we're not going to do that.

1964
02:51:19.12 --> 02:51:21.12
But he stood by those words.

1965
02:51:21.12 --> 02:51:27.12
We're a random dude that he's never shot with on a random target with one bullet, a go no go.

1966
02:51:27.12 --> 02:51:29.12
And he was like, yeah, got this.

1967
02:51:29.12 --> 02:51:33.12
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, free you legit.

1968
02:51:33.12 --> 02:51:37.12
One of the few dudes on the planet that my phone rings, I'm going to go help him with whatever.

1969
02:51:37.12 --> 02:51:38.12
Clutter percent man.

1970
02:51:38.12 --> 02:51:40.12
Yeah, what a beast.

1971
02:51:40.12 --> 02:51:43.12
Um, you graduate tonight for school, obviously.

1972
02:51:43.12 --> 02:51:46.12
You got another, IFL fight and you win.

1973
02:51:46.12 --> 02:51:48.12
You do another.

1974
02:51:48.12 --> 02:51:53.12
All army combat of champion ship and you win that for a third time.

1975
02:51:53.12 --> 02:51:54.12
Yeah.

1976
02:51:54.12 --> 02:51:55.12
Um,

1977
02:51:55.12 --> 02:52:01.12
you get a sponsorship from Ranger Up with Nick.

1978
02:52:01.12 --> 02:52:03.12
Yeah, who wrote this book with you?

1979
02:52:03.12 --> 02:52:04.12
That's right.

1980
02:52:04.12 --> 02:52:08.12
Nick is a former army army infantry officer.

1981
02:52:08.12 --> 02:52:09.12
Your last point, guy.

1982
02:52:09.12 --> 02:52:10.12
Yep.

1983
02:52:10.12 --> 02:52:13.12
Um, and he had started this company Ranger Up.

1984
02:52:13.12 --> 02:52:19.12
And I think you described as like the first of the military,

1985
02:52:19.12 --> 02:52:21.12
a peril company thing.

1986
02:52:21.12 --> 02:52:22.12
Yep.

1987
02:52:22.12 --> 02:52:26.12
Yeah, is from Grunt style to nine line.

1988
02:52:26.12 --> 02:52:29.12
You know, they're, they're, they're a plethora of them.

1989
02:52:29.12 --> 02:52:31.12
You know, I think the two at the time,

1990
02:52:31.12 --> 02:52:35.12
Ranger Up in 762, where the, like, the two,

1991
02:52:35.12 --> 02:52:38.12
military, a peril t-shirt company is that you'd see it.

1992
02:52:38.12 --> 02:52:41.12
The A fees are, you'd see soldiers walking around,

1993
02:52:41.12 --> 02:52:42.12
Benny and her bragg, you know,

1994
02:52:42.12 --> 02:52:45.12
Sporting their like tough guy shirts.

1995
02:52:45.12 --> 02:52:47.12
But they were the first.

1996
02:52:47.12 --> 02:52:49.12
Uh,

1997
02:52:49.12 --> 02:52:53.12
you lose a decision that Jason may have Miller.

1998
02:52:53.12 --> 02:52:54.12
Hmm.

1999
02:52:54.12 --> 02:52:55.12
Yeah, that sucked.

2000
02:52:55.12 --> 02:52:57.12
I didn't lose that fight.

2001
02:52:57.12 --> 02:52:59.12
You lost the decision I lost.

2002
02:52:59.12 --> 02:52:59.12
I lost.

2003
02:52:59.12 --> 02:53:00.12
They have no.

2004
02:53:00.12 --> 02:53:01.12
Yeah.

2005
02:53:01.12 --> 02:53:03.12
How come you lost?

2006
02:53:03.12 --> 02:53:04.12
Um,

2007
02:53:08.12 --> 02:53:10.12
Yeah, I don't, the, if I went back,

2008
02:53:10.12 --> 02:53:13.12
one, one, I didn't finish the,

2009
02:53:13.12 --> 02:53:16.12
their multiple times where I was in good position.

2010
02:53:16.12 --> 02:53:17.12
There's, there's a famous photo.

2011
02:53:17.12 --> 02:53:19.12
I'm on his back. I have a rear naked choke.

2012
02:53:19.12 --> 02:53:23.12
And, uh, and I'm like looking up at the refs and,

2013
02:53:23.12 --> 02:53:25.12
and at the judges being like,

2014
02:53:25.12 --> 02:53:28.12
show, yeah, showboding up against the cage.

2015
02:53:28.12 --> 02:53:30.12
I have his back hooks around,

2016
02:53:30.12 --> 02:53:32.12
rear naked choke is underneath there.

2017
02:53:32.12 --> 02:53:34.12
And I'm doing like the Nick Diaz moment.

2018
02:53:34.12 --> 02:53:36.12
Remember that when Nick Diaz got that triangle in,

2019
02:53:36.12 --> 02:53:37.12
and you like sit still like,

2020
02:53:37.12 --> 02:53:38.12
flip soft everybody.

2021
02:53:38.12 --> 02:53:39.12
Yeah.

2022
02:53:39.12 --> 02:53:40.12
Imagine if I got out.

2023
02:53:40.12 --> 02:53:44.12
You know, like that was what happened a couple of times.

2024
02:53:44.12 --> 02:53:47.12
Yeah.

2025
02:53:47.12 --> 02:53:49.12
Not just once, but twice, where I had, I had already fought Jason before.

2026
02:53:49.12 --> 02:53:50.12
Yeah.

2027
02:53:50.12 --> 02:53:51.12
I fought him in a new tournament.

2028
02:53:51.12 --> 02:53:52.12
And I destroyed him.

2029
02:53:52.12 --> 02:53:56.12
I mean, I just like, mass occurred him through him every which way.

2030
02:53:56.12 --> 02:53:57.12
The rules were kind of pride.

2031
02:53:57.12 --> 02:53:59.12
So I could, so I could soccer kick on the ground.

2032
02:53:59.12 --> 02:54:00.12
I could kneel on the ground.

2033
02:54:00.12 --> 02:54:02.12
So in the grapple transition, which is like,

2034
02:54:02.12 --> 02:54:04.12
where I really like to be,

2035
02:54:04.12 --> 02:54:08.12
I was just inflicting non-stop damage for the whole entire duration of the fight.

2036
02:54:08.12 --> 02:54:09.12
Similar to the,

2037
02:54:09.12 --> 02:54:11.12
time I fought Scott Smith,

2038
02:54:11.12 --> 02:54:13.12
and then I fought Scott Smith again.

2039
02:54:13.12 --> 02:54:14.12
And I lost Scott Smith.

2040
02:54:14.12 --> 02:54:15.12
I fought Jason.

2041
02:54:15.12 --> 02:54:16.12
I smashed him.

2042
02:54:16.12 --> 02:54:17.12
And then I fought him again.

2043
02:54:17.12 --> 02:54:19.12
And I do the same fight.

2044
02:54:19.12 --> 02:54:20.12
He doesn't.

2045
02:54:20.12 --> 02:54:23.12
You know, he shows up different.

2046
02:54:23.12 --> 02:54:28.12
So like again, I'm too stupid to change to adapt.

2047
02:54:31.12 --> 02:54:37.12
So you kind of like go on a vengeance fight after Jason.

2048
02:54:37.12 --> 02:54:38.12
Yeah.

2049
02:54:38.12 --> 02:54:42.12
And when you describe this in a book, man.

2050
02:54:42.12 --> 02:54:45.12
You know, it sounded like you're a little bit sketched out about it.

2051
02:54:45.12 --> 02:54:46.12
Yeah.

2052
02:54:46.12 --> 02:54:48.12
So just to set up, you have another MMA fight.

2053
02:54:48.12 --> 02:54:50.12
You're about to deploy again.

2054
02:54:50.12 --> 02:54:52.12
You're about to go to Afghanistan.

2055
02:54:52.12 --> 02:54:56.12
And you have a bad taste in your mouth from losing to Jason Miller.

2056
02:54:56.12 --> 02:54:58.12
And so you get another fight.

2057
02:54:58.12 --> 02:55:01.12
And you like annihilate this guy.

2058
02:55:01.12 --> 02:55:02.12
Yeah.

2059
02:55:02.12 --> 02:55:03.12
Yeah.

2060
02:55:03.12 --> 02:55:06.12
There was no, I didn't go in there to win.

2061
02:55:06.12 --> 02:55:08.12
I went in there to like hurt.

2062
02:55:08.12 --> 02:55:10.12
And I, I, very, you know,

2063
02:55:10.12 --> 02:55:13.12
this, like, high low athletes, they're not going in there.

2064
02:55:13.12 --> 02:55:15.12
John Jones isn't going in there to like murder somebody.

2065
02:55:15.12 --> 02:55:17.12
He's going in there to be a champion.

2066
02:55:17.12 --> 02:55:20.12
And I was going in there to hurt whoever I was fighting.

2067
02:55:20.12 --> 02:55:25.12
Now that was not typical of any time that ever fought.

2068
02:55:25.12 --> 02:55:27.12
I wanted to be the best fighter that I could be.

2069
02:55:27.12 --> 02:55:28.12
And I liked fighting.

2070
02:55:28.12 --> 02:55:31.12
I didn't like fighting because I was going to hurt people.

2071
02:55:31.12 --> 02:55:33.12
That's like psychopath stuff.

2072
02:55:33.12 --> 02:55:38.12
Losing that fight, getting ready to go to war in two Afghanistan.

2073
02:55:38.12 --> 02:55:42.12
And this is now 2008 Afghanistan, which is like 2006 Iraq.

2074
02:55:42.12 --> 02:55:44.12
Like this is peak war.

2075
02:55:44.12 --> 02:55:48.12
And I'm like in the zone, I wanted, I wanted violence.

2076
02:55:48.12 --> 02:55:51.12
You know, I was, um, and I wanted to hurt somebody.

2077
02:55:51.12 --> 02:55:52.12
So how did you beat him?

2078
02:55:52.12 --> 02:55:53.12
Was it like a mountain?

2079
02:55:53.12 --> 02:55:55.12
Oh, I saw him on a pound.

2080
02:55:55.12 --> 02:55:57.12
Yeah, I, I picked him up and I put him on his ear.

2081
02:55:57.12 --> 02:56:00.12
You know, I take the earth and I hit him in the face with the earth hard.

2082
02:56:00.12 --> 02:56:04.12
And he's already on, he's already on Wackadutal Street when he hits the mat.

2083
02:56:04.12 --> 02:56:06.12
And I, I go straight to a dominant position.

2084
02:56:06.12 --> 02:56:08.12
And I start dropping hammers.

2085
02:56:08.12 --> 02:56:11.12
And, um, you know, he's piece out in three.

2086
02:56:11.12 --> 02:56:14.12
And I probably hit him nine times.

2087
02:56:14.12 --> 02:56:17.12
And, um, you know, when you're in that dominant position,

2088
02:56:17.12 --> 02:56:19.12
you're fist hits their face.

2089
02:56:19.12 --> 02:56:21.12
They're brain hits their head.

2090
02:56:21.12 --> 02:56:23.12
They're head hits the mount mat.

2091
02:56:23.12 --> 02:56:25.12
The brain then hits the head to get.

2092
02:56:25.12 --> 02:56:28.12
So like your, like his brain is getting concussed.

2093
02:56:28.12 --> 02:56:29.12
18 times.

2094
02:56:29.12 --> 02:56:30.12
It's 18 times.

2095
02:56:30.12 --> 02:56:32.12
And I was hitting hard.

2096
02:56:32.12 --> 02:56:36.12
And he didn't get up for a while.

2097
02:56:36.12 --> 02:56:40.12
They, they, they, they, they, so he stayed unconscious in the ring.

2098
02:56:40.12 --> 02:56:42.12
They brought in the stretcher.

2099
02:56:42.12 --> 02:56:44.12
They moved him onto the stretcher.

2100
02:56:44.12 --> 02:56:45.12
They carried him out of the ring.

2101
02:56:45.12 --> 02:56:46.12
He's still unconscious.

2102
02:56:46.12 --> 02:56:48.12
They were probably seven minutes into this.

2103
02:56:48.12 --> 02:56:52.12
He's been unconscious for, you know, six, seven minutes.

2104
02:56:52.12 --> 02:56:55.12
Oh, Jack.

2105
02:56:55.12 --> 02:56:56.12
Yeah.

2106
02:56:56.12 --> 02:56:57.12
What is our item?

2107
02:56:57.12 --> 02:56:58.12
He's fine.

2108
02:56:58.12 --> 02:56:59.12
Sure.

2109
02:56:59.12 --> 02:57:00.12
Yeah.

2110
02:57:00.12 --> 02:57:03.12
And now it's time for you to go on deployment again.

2111
02:57:03.12 --> 02:57:12.12
You know, you deploy as an, as an augment to help other groups as a sniper pair.

2112
02:57:12.12 --> 02:57:13.12
Do I have that right?

2113
02:57:13.12 --> 02:57:14.12
That's right.

2114
02:57:14.12 --> 02:57:15.12
Did I read that right?

2115
02:57:15.12 --> 02:57:16.12
So we volunteered.

2116
02:57:16.12 --> 02:57:18.12
The, the, you suck.

2117
02:57:18.12 --> 02:57:21.12
This is pretty, first-special force command.

2118
02:57:21.12 --> 02:57:23.12
They had seven groups going over.

2119
02:57:23.12 --> 02:57:28.12
And they come and they ask for, they come to the Halo sniper team,

2120
02:57:28.12 --> 02:57:33.12
which is the team that is on and they said, hey, does anybody want to volunteer for this company's deployment?

2121
02:57:33.12 --> 02:57:37.12
Because we are looking for this specific thing.

2122
02:57:37.12 --> 02:57:39.12
And that was to be a sniper asset.

2123
02:57:39.12 --> 02:57:43.12
That's kind of like, as part of the siege of SOTIF asset.

2124
02:57:43.12 --> 02:57:50.12
So if a team is going to go do a specific mission, they'll have this, these guys, you know, kind of on the deck.

2125
02:57:50.12 --> 02:57:51.12
They can just, yeah, we got him.

2126
02:57:51.12 --> 02:57:52.12
Here you go.

2127
02:57:52.12 --> 02:57:53.12
That was the plan.

2128
02:57:53.12 --> 02:58:00.12
Then as soon as you get there, your sniper partner, your shooting partner, his gets like a deer,

2129
02:58:00.12 --> 02:58:05.12
John type letters, and the worst kind of deer, John letter.

2130
02:58:05.12 --> 02:58:10.12
Bank accounts empty, divorce papers served, motorcycle sold.

2131
02:58:10.12 --> 02:58:13.12
He had friends calling him, be like, hey, bro, I just bought your guns.

2132
02:58:13.12 --> 02:58:16.12
You know, she went like scorched earth.

2133
02:58:16.12 --> 02:58:18.12
She sulked the fields.

2134
02:58:18.12 --> 02:58:21.12
This was total nuclear on him.

2135
02:58:21.12 --> 02:58:23.12
So he goes home.

2136
02:58:23.12 --> 02:58:24.12
Yeah.

2137
02:58:24.12 --> 02:58:28.12
And this means Tim Kennedy's on the solo operation.

2138
02:58:28.12 --> 02:58:32.12
It's by myself and Afghanistan.

2139
02:58:32.12 --> 02:58:40.12
And this is where the section that I opened the podcast from, the chapters called The Value of Deaf.

2140
02:58:40.12 --> 02:58:46.12
And as I was reading this, I was getting uncomfortable and sketched out, just reading it.

2141
02:58:46.12 --> 02:58:50.12
I'm like, I don't like any, I don't like anything about this, right?

2142
02:58:50.12 --> 02:58:53.12
So you're going on a resupply mission.

2143
02:58:53.12 --> 02:58:55.12
You know, resupply mission, I'm going to go to resupply.

2144
02:58:55.12 --> 02:58:57.12
Okay, let's think about what this means here.

2145
02:58:57.12 --> 02:59:07.12
You got to go 150 plus miles from your location in Canterhart, out to Fob and Akonda.

2146
02:59:07.12 --> 02:59:10.12
The way that you're going to be going out there, and this is what you're writing about,

2147
02:59:10.12 --> 02:59:12.12
it's a channelized road system.

2148
02:59:12.12 --> 02:59:15.12
There's like, there's not a good way to go.

2149
02:59:15.12 --> 02:59:22.12
No, it's just not conducive to a comfortable passage, safe passage.

2150
02:59:22.12 --> 02:59:26.12
Okay, so I'm now I'm reading this and I'm like, okay, well that kind of sucks, you know?

2151
02:59:26.12 --> 02:59:31.12
But you know, sometimes you've got to suck it up and then I keep reading, you got 80.

2152
02:59:31.12 --> 02:59:32.12
Gingle trucks.

2153
02:59:32.12 --> 02:59:37.12
80 freaking supply trucks, but they're not American supply trucks.

2154
02:59:37.12 --> 02:59:41.12
They're not driven by American army drivers.

2155
02:59:41.12 --> 02:59:44.12
They're Afghan jingle trucks, which is like these.

2156
02:59:44.12 --> 02:59:49.12
I don't know, like the look, freaking gypsy vehicles, chips you cast.

2157
02:59:49.12 --> 02:59:51.12
Bad maintenance on them.

2158
02:59:51.12 --> 02:59:57.12
No armor, obviously driven by Afghan drivers who have, you know,

2159
02:59:57.12 --> 02:59:59.12
questionable loyalty at best.

2160
02:59:59.12 --> 03:00:02.12
They have questionable loyalty.

2161
03:00:02.12 --> 03:00:06.12
And then you've got, I mean, obviously they got no comms.

2162
03:00:06.12 --> 03:00:10.12
This is just, this is just, I don't like any of this.

2163
03:00:10.12 --> 03:00:15.12
And then you've got your security forces, which is made up of an American SFA team, right?

2164
03:00:15.12 --> 03:00:18.12
Augmented by one Tim Kennedy.

2165
03:00:18.12 --> 03:00:21.12
You guys got RGs.

2166
03:00:21.12 --> 03:00:23.12
So you got the mind resistant RGs.

2167
03:00:23.12 --> 03:00:24.12
How many RGs did you have?

2168
03:00:24.12 --> 03:00:25.12
Three.

2169
03:00:25.12 --> 03:00:26.12
Okay, so three RGs.

2170
03:00:26.12 --> 03:00:28.12
You got to check special forces company.

2171
03:00:28.12 --> 03:00:30.12
They've got slick homies.

2172
03:00:30.12 --> 03:00:32.12
And they have land cruisers.

2173
03:00:32.12 --> 03:00:33.12
Okay.

2174
03:00:33.12 --> 03:00:35.12
Are they, they're not armored, don't?

2175
03:00:35.12 --> 03:00:36.12
No.

2176
03:00:36.12 --> 03:00:37.12
Okay.

2177
03:00:37.12 --> 03:00:40.12
So, Recipli and an replacement of the Czech company.

2178
03:00:40.12 --> 03:00:41.12
Okay.

2179
03:00:41.12 --> 03:00:46.12
So it was a required, we had to move these guys into this Firebase.

2180
03:00:46.12 --> 03:00:49.12
And so they had to go, they had to make this drive.

2181
03:00:49.12 --> 03:00:54.12
They were, this company of Czech guys were going to be at Firebase and a condo for the next year.

2182
03:00:54.12 --> 03:00:58.12
And we had to resupply their substance for the next year.

2183
03:00:58.12 --> 03:01:03.12
And addition to the ODA that was already going to be collocated on the on firebase and a condo with them.

2184
03:01:03.12 --> 03:01:04.12
Got it.

2185
03:01:04.12 --> 03:01:08.12
And in addition to all of them, you also have Afghan soldiers with you.

2186
03:01:08.12 --> 03:01:11.12
And they've got homies to any commandos.

2187
03:01:11.12 --> 03:01:12.12
Okay.

2188
03:01:12.12 --> 03:01:13.12
How many of them did you have?

2189
03:01:13.12 --> 03:01:15.12
Can we add them to just rough numbers?

2190
03:01:15.12 --> 03:01:16.12
Eight trucks.

2191
03:01:16.12 --> 03:01:18.12
Okay.

2192
03:01:18.12 --> 03:01:20.12
So you guys go on this.

2193
03:01:20.12 --> 03:01:26.12
Clearly, you are not clearly, but most likely compromise to synergy because all you got all those Afghan drivers.

2194
03:01:26.12 --> 03:01:27.12
And you guys did everything.

2195
03:01:27.12 --> 03:01:29.12
You took their phones and all the stuff that you're supposed to do.

2196
03:01:29.12 --> 03:01:33.12
But fighting starts almost as quickly as

2197
03:01:33.12 --> 03:01:34.12
you start.

2198
03:01:34.12 --> 03:01:37.12
I mean the fighting starts.

2199
03:01:37.12 --> 03:01:39.12
And the sabotage.

2200
03:01:39.12 --> 03:01:42.12
Those things were happening as soon as we were on out of the gate.

2201
03:01:42.12 --> 03:01:48.12
In addition to, you know, getting in contact with within hours of leaving can to heart.

2202
03:01:48.12 --> 03:01:53.12
Each of the vehicles of the 80 vehicles, you know, we had three drivers and each vehicle.

2203
03:01:53.12 --> 03:01:57.12
So we had 240 Afghans that were inside of the.

2204
03:01:57.12 --> 03:01:58.12
Yeah.

2205
03:01:58.12 --> 03:01:59.12
I love it.

2206
03:01:59.12 --> 03:02:01.12
You're just immediately like, this is so terrible.

2207
03:02:01.12 --> 03:02:04.12
I don't like it.

2208
03:02:04.12 --> 03:02:05.12
No.

2209
03:02:05.12 --> 03:02:07.12
But this is the, this is the soft model.

2210
03:02:07.12 --> 03:02:10.12
Like this is the SF by with and through.

2211
03:02:10.12 --> 03:02:15.12
You know, we're doing the special forces approach is we do everything through our partners.

2212
03:02:15.12 --> 03:02:17.12
You know, the advise assist to company.

2213
03:02:17.12 --> 03:02:19.12
We're doing, this is a AAA mission.

2214
03:02:19.12 --> 03:02:21.12
You know, we're advising the checks.

2215
03:02:21.12 --> 03:02:23.12
We're advising the Afghans.

2216
03:02:23.12 --> 03:02:25.12
We're assisting them and we're accompanying them.

2217
03:02:25.12 --> 03:02:29.12
So this is, this is, this is the SF mission to the core.

2218
03:02:29.12 --> 03:02:31.12
That is dumb as it is.

2219
03:02:31.12 --> 03:02:39.12
You got a check soldier that gets wounded pretty quick out of the gate.

2220
03:02:39.12 --> 03:02:41.12
He gets met a back out of there.

2221
03:02:41.12 --> 03:02:45.12
Eventually you, you hit this pressure plate ID.

2222
03:02:45.12 --> 03:02:46.12
That's where I open the book.

2223
03:02:46.12 --> 03:02:50.12
We open the podcast up with there's a, the freaking vehicle in front of you.

2224
03:02:50.12 --> 03:02:52.12
Lans on your vehicle.

2225
03:02:52.12 --> 03:02:53.12
Yeah.

2226
03:02:53.12 --> 03:02:55.12
That's a hell of an ID.

2227
03:02:55.12 --> 03:02:56.12
You got small arms.

2228
03:02:56.12 --> 03:02:58.12
You got RPGs coming in on you.

2229
03:02:58.12 --> 03:03:02.12
And I got a real chunk from the book here.

2230
03:03:02.12 --> 03:03:04.12
Get into some details.

2231
03:03:04.12 --> 03:03:11.12
Dust is still fucking everywhere, but a lane of light clears from us to where the front vehicle

2232
03:03:11.12 --> 03:03:15.12
had fallen off of our 60 meters away when we were backed up.

2233
03:03:15.12 --> 03:03:19.12
It is eerie kind of like when you're sitting on your couch on a lazy day looking out the window

2234
03:03:19.12 --> 03:03:23.12
and you catch a beam of light and watch the dust particles whirl around inside it.

2235
03:03:23.12 --> 03:03:27.12
The beams are on either side of us full of dust, but the lane to the vehicle is clear.

2236
03:03:27.12 --> 03:03:33.12
It is almost as if God cleared a path for us, but that path didn't make my life any easier.

2237
03:03:33.12 --> 03:03:35.12
Those dudes are still alive.

2238
03:03:35.12 --> 03:03:37.12
They're still fucking alive.

2239
03:03:37.12 --> 03:03:38.12
I risk shouts out.

2240
03:03:38.12 --> 03:03:39.12
He's right.

2241
03:03:39.12 --> 03:03:40.12
I see it too.

2242
03:03:40.12 --> 03:03:41.12
One guy is moving.

2243
03:03:41.12 --> 03:03:43.12
I'm going to sprint to that man.

2244
03:03:43.12 --> 03:03:44.12
I risk yells to me.

2245
03:03:44.12 --> 03:03:46.12
That's a bad fucking idea man.

2246
03:03:46.12 --> 03:03:48.12
And if you do it, we're all going to die.

2247
03:03:48.12 --> 03:03:49.12
I tell him.

2248
03:03:49.12 --> 03:03:52.12
There's no lack of seriousness in my voice.

2249
03:03:52.12 --> 03:03:56.12
I do not think we have any chance of surviving that run right in the heart of this ambush.

2250
03:03:56.12 --> 03:04:01.12
I risk looks at right at me and says, I'm going.

2251
03:04:01.12 --> 03:04:03.12
He takes off in a dead sprint.

2252
03:04:03.12 --> 03:04:05.12
I hear the guns pick up.

2253
03:04:05.12 --> 03:04:06.12
They see him.

2254
03:04:06.12 --> 03:04:08.12
I'm still holding my sniper rifle for some reason.

2255
03:04:08.12 --> 03:04:13.12
I don't grab my AR as I take a deep breath in sprint after Irish.

2256
03:04:13.12 --> 03:04:15.12
I do not want to be doing this.

2257
03:04:15.12 --> 03:04:22.12
I do not want to expose myself, but I don't want to fail my comrades even more.

2258
03:04:22.12 --> 03:04:26.12
We get to the vehicle unscathed and I look inside.

2259
03:04:26.12 --> 03:04:28.12
Fuck, they are in bad shape.

2260
03:04:28.12 --> 03:04:30.12
The first guy has lost both of his legs.

2261
03:04:30.12 --> 03:04:33.12
At the quads, they simply aren't there.

2262
03:04:33.12 --> 03:04:41.12
I pull him out in a sandbag carry and his bile and blood and guts spill out onto my uniform rolling down my stomach and soaking my legs.

2263
03:04:41.12 --> 03:04:49.12
Even with the adrenaline and the fear and the explosions and the bullets, I acknowledge that this is the most disgusting thing that has ever happened to me.

2264
03:04:49.12 --> 03:04:53.12
I risk grabs the other dude, who is in rough state shape but still breathing.

2265
03:04:53.12 --> 03:04:58.12
As we start moving the 60 meters back to our vehicle, I see a squad of 6 to 8 young,

2266
03:04:58.12 --> 03:05:02.12
6 to 8 guys moving out of the woods to finish us.

2267
03:05:02.12 --> 03:05:08.12
They are the assault element getting ready to fight to the X and kill those of us standing on it.

2268
03:05:08.12 --> 03:05:10.12
I have a choice.

2269
03:05:10.12 --> 03:05:18.12
I can drop this guy and leave him for dead so I can fight to hand it or I can fire my cannon of a sniper rifle, one handed Rambo style in their general direction.

2270
03:05:18.12 --> 03:05:23.12
While trying to move my wounded guy to a high carry with one arm on the other side.

2271
03:05:23.12 --> 03:05:31.12
Whether it is courage or because I knew I wish would have just picked him up and carried two guys I opt for the one handed fire.

2272
03:05:31.12 --> 03:05:33.12
I know I am not hitting anything.

2273
03:05:33.12 --> 03:05:35.12
I know I am not even close.

2274
03:05:35.12 --> 03:05:36.12
They see us.

2275
03:05:36.12 --> 03:05:42.12
A squad against two guys who are carrying wounded Afghans and have no real ability to return fire.

2276
03:05:42.12 --> 03:05:44.12
We are dead.

2277
03:05:44.12 --> 03:05:48.12
Then thank God.

2278
03:05:48.12 --> 03:05:50.12
Keller sees them.

2279
03:05:50.12 --> 03:05:56.12
The sweet melody of the 50 cow fills my ears and they evaporate.

2280
03:05:56.12 --> 03:05:59.12
When I say that I need you to understand what I mean they didn't die.

2281
03:05:59.12 --> 03:06:01.12
It wasn't like there were corpses sitting there.

2282
03:06:01.12 --> 03:06:03.12
They fucking evaporated.

2283
03:06:03.12 --> 03:06:08.12
There is just a pink mist floating in the air where they had been.

2284
03:06:08.12 --> 03:06:16.12
It is like that Jake Gowne Hall scene in Jarrhead where he says he wanted the pink mist.

2285
03:06:16.12 --> 03:06:19.12
You see after pulling the trigger on a sniper rifle.

2286
03:06:19.12 --> 03:06:21.12
I had never wanted it before.

2287
03:06:21.12 --> 03:06:26.12
But right now I have never been happier to see anything in my entire life.

2288
03:06:26.12 --> 03:06:34.12
Keller just saved me for what proved to be the first time of many over the next few days.

2289
03:06:34.12 --> 03:06:43.12
I have recreated that and I don't understand how Keller was able to shoot them.

2290
03:06:43.12 --> 03:06:44.12
It doesn't make sense.

2291
03:06:44.12 --> 03:06:46.12
We are in between him.

2292
03:06:46.12 --> 03:06:55.12
He is in an elevated position on the top of a humvee shooting down through us and around us.

2293
03:06:55.12 --> 03:06:58.12
And the Taliban are below us.

2294
03:06:58.12 --> 03:07:03.12
So he is like threading the needle in between us with a 50 cow.

2295
03:07:03.12 --> 03:07:08.12
That is a big bullet.

2296
03:07:08.12 --> 03:07:14.12
And it is a big bullet that carries a ton of energy and he is 60 meters away.

2297
03:07:14.12 --> 03:07:17.12
So we are talking peak energy, perfect trajectory.

2298
03:07:17.12 --> 03:07:22.12
If one doesn't make sense how he did it to it wasn't pink mist.

2299
03:07:22.12 --> 03:07:25.12
It was just they were there and then they weren't.

2300
03:07:25.12 --> 03:07:27.12
There was a line of dudes.

2301
03:07:27.12 --> 03:07:34.12
It is the dumbest thing that we ran down to the ex.

2302
03:07:34.12 --> 03:07:39.12
The kill zone of the ambush to grab those bodies because that is the last place you want to go.

2303
03:07:39.12 --> 03:07:42.12
The first thing you do is get off the ex.

2304
03:07:42.12 --> 03:07:49.12
But ours goes down there and when we are dragging these bodies, I have an SR25 sniper rifle with the suppressor on the end of it with a loophole magnified object on top of it.

2305
03:07:49.12 --> 03:07:52.12
And I have a dude like this trying to shoot.

2306
03:07:52.12 --> 03:08:06.12
And I also felt those rounds traveling past us and it was like it is getting hit with that round going past our heads as those bodies just disappeared.

2307
03:08:06.12 --> 03:08:08.12
Wow.

2308
03:08:08.12 --> 03:08:10.12
Killer.

2309
03:08:10.12 --> 03:08:12.12
Yeah, God bless killer.

2310
03:08:12.12 --> 03:08:15.12
Freaking Johnny on the spot with the Moduce.

2311
03:08:15.12 --> 03:08:17.12
And God bless the Moduce.

2312
03:08:17.12 --> 03:08:18.12
Right.

2313
03:08:18.12 --> 03:08:21.12
Alright.

2314
03:08:21.12 --> 03:08:22.12
This.

2315
03:08:22.12 --> 03:08:26.12
And if you are listening to this and you are like wait a second who is coloring and who is Irish?

2316
03:08:26.12 --> 03:08:28.12
Yeah, you got to get the book.

2317
03:08:28.12 --> 03:08:31.12
You got to get the book and you will get the back stories on these guys.

2318
03:08:31.12 --> 03:08:35.12
These are current dudes as well.

2319
03:08:35.12 --> 03:08:40.12
Yeah, I am just saying from the point of like if you are listening to me read this and you are like wait a second who is counting.

2320
03:08:40.12 --> 03:08:44.12
You need to read the story and you know you might not find out there.

2321
03:08:44.12 --> 03:08:47.12
They are really name and date of birth and they are social security number.

2322
03:08:47.12 --> 03:08:53.12
If the story will make a little bit more they will make total sense because I only read a little chunk of it.

2323
03:08:53.12 --> 03:09:06.12
But just to give an example of number one what the books like but also some of the intensity of the combat that you are talking about and that you learned from.

2324
03:09:06.12 --> 03:09:08.12
This goes on man.

2325
03:09:08.12 --> 03:09:09.12
This goes on.

2326
03:09:09.12 --> 03:09:13.12
What was the total time it took you to get to an economy?

2327
03:09:13.12 --> 03:09:15.12
From the time that we call to tick.

2328
03:09:15.12 --> 03:09:18.12
No, from the time that you left how many days were a week.

2329
03:09:18.12 --> 03:09:22.12
And you guys are fighting kind of the whole time.

2330
03:09:22.12 --> 03:09:26.12
Yeah, we call a tick out of a tick.

2331
03:09:26.12 --> 03:09:30.12
We call broken arrow on ethos on ambush.

2332
03:09:30.12 --> 03:09:34.12
So from the time that broken arrow is kind of this.

2333
03:09:34.12 --> 03:09:39.12
If you don't send us every available asset we are all going to die type of emergency call.

2334
03:09:39.12 --> 03:09:43.12
From that moment we have three and a half days.

2335
03:09:43.12 --> 03:09:47.12
I think we had already been in movement for three days.

2336
03:09:47.12 --> 03:09:49.12
So I guess six days total.

2337
03:09:49.12 --> 03:09:55.12
Yeah, so just so everyone understands that the broken arrow is a call that means you're going to get support.

2338
03:09:55.12 --> 03:09:59.12
Namely air support from all over the place.

2339
03:09:59.12 --> 03:10:00.12
Every time common help you out.

2340
03:10:00.12 --> 03:10:01.12
Yeah.

2341
03:10:01.12 --> 03:10:08.12
Everybody that's available will come and give that support.

2342
03:10:08.12 --> 03:10:13.12
You eventually link up with the ODE 18 that's from an economy.

2343
03:10:13.12 --> 03:10:14.12
They come out to meet you guys.

2344
03:10:14.12 --> 03:10:19.12
They're fighting through the village to us and we're fighting through the ravine to them.

2345
03:10:19.12 --> 03:10:23.12
And that happens about two to two and a half.

2346
03:10:23.12 --> 03:10:26.12
Two days in this gunfight.

2347
03:10:26.12 --> 03:10:29.12
Eventually I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

2348
03:10:29.12 --> 03:10:35.12
You get to this one of the villages that you were taking fire from.

2349
03:10:35.12 --> 03:10:38.12
You guys decide you got to go in there.

2350
03:10:38.12 --> 03:10:41.12
You got to clear this village of enemy fighters.

2351
03:10:41.12 --> 03:10:43.12
This is now like urban combat.

2352
03:10:43.12 --> 03:10:44.12
You're going street to street.

2353
03:10:44.12 --> 03:10:46.12
You're going house to house.

2354
03:10:46.12 --> 03:10:54.12
At one point there's a peak and a machine gun is just unloading rounds at your team.

2355
03:10:54.12 --> 03:10:59.12
As you're trying to push through this compound.

2356
03:10:59.12 --> 03:11:04.12
Let me go to the book here.

2357
03:11:04.12 --> 03:11:10.12
I can see the barrel of the pkms sticking out of a small window in the courtyard 25 meters away.

2358
03:11:10.12 --> 03:11:14.12
The RG that's your big miners is in a vehicle.

2359
03:11:14.12 --> 03:11:17.12
The RG is still smashing into the wooden gate.

2360
03:11:17.12 --> 03:11:23.12
But the door will not give and the rounds are pouring out of the pkms into the vehicle.

2361
03:11:23.12 --> 03:11:26.12
It's only a matter of time before we start getting killed.

2362
03:11:26.12 --> 03:11:29.12
I need to take out that gun.

2363
03:11:29.12 --> 03:11:37.12
I reach for one of my frag grenades, pull the pin and take aim at the tiny window 20 to 25 meters away.

2364
03:11:37.12 --> 03:11:41.12
If this wasn't combat, my friends would be laughing at me at this moment.

2365
03:11:41.12 --> 03:11:43.12
You see, I suck at throwing.

2366
03:11:43.12 --> 03:11:45.12
I mean, I really suck.

2367
03:11:45.12 --> 03:11:47.12
Yes, I'm a professional athlete.

2368
03:11:47.12 --> 03:11:52.12
Yes, I can do all measures of physical activity at a level most people can't fathom.

2369
03:11:52.12 --> 03:11:55.12
But you know what I never did growing up?

2370
03:11:55.12 --> 03:11:57.12
Ball sports.

2371
03:11:57.12 --> 03:12:02.12
It was so bad that when I joined the special forces and had to throw something to one of my teammates,

2372
03:12:02.12 --> 03:12:05.12
I believe it was a role of 100 mile an hour tape.

2373
03:12:05.12 --> 03:12:11.12
They were so horrified that they began instituting football, throwing practices part of my training regimen.

2374
03:12:11.12 --> 03:12:19.12
I might be the only SF guy ever that has a new guy in addition to the normal tasks of shooting, planning and physical fitness.

2375
03:12:19.12 --> 03:12:22.12
I had to work on my spiral.

2376
03:12:22.12 --> 03:12:26.12
But here I am, grenade in hand, with my team counting on me.

2377
03:12:26.12 --> 03:12:28.12
And I launch it.

2378
03:12:28.12 --> 03:12:30.12
And it is perfect.

2379
03:12:30.12 --> 03:12:33.12
It isn't a log that lays we float into the window.

2380
03:12:33.12 --> 03:12:35.12
It doesn't bounce in.

2381
03:12:35.12 --> 03:12:41.12
It's a fucking air in Rogers laser that flies from my hand and connects directly to that window.

2382
03:12:41.12 --> 03:12:43.12
It is the best throw I ever made.

2383
03:12:43.12 --> 03:12:45.12
You know, weird fucked up way.

2384
03:12:45.12 --> 03:12:48.12
It is one of the happiest moments in my life.

2385
03:12:48.12 --> 03:12:53.12
A grenade going off in the movies is very different for what happens in real life.

2386
03:12:53.12 --> 03:12:55.12
It's not a giant fireball.

2387
03:12:55.12 --> 03:12:56.12
It's not dramatic.

2388
03:12:56.12 --> 03:12:58.12
It's a hollow foot.

2389
03:12:58.12 --> 03:13:03.12
It's that late night sound of opening the refrigerator to see what's in there.

2390
03:13:03.12 --> 03:13:06.12
And the watermelon rolls out and hits the ground.

2391
03:13:06.12 --> 03:13:09.12
That's all a grenade is after you throw it a little hollow pop.

2392
03:13:09.12 --> 03:13:15.12
And after you hear that pop, you either want to hear nothing or you want to hear men screaming.

2393
03:13:15.12 --> 03:13:20.12
You do not want to hear women or children scream.

2394
03:13:20.12 --> 03:13:24.12
You absolutely do not want to hear that.

2395
03:13:24.12 --> 03:13:29.12
Yet that's what I hear.

2396
03:13:29.12 --> 03:13:31.12
My soul turns inside.

2397
03:13:31.12 --> 03:13:33.12
The helplessness tears me apart.

2398
03:13:33.12 --> 03:13:35.12
I want to take that fucking grenade back.

2399
03:13:35.12 --> 03:13:38.12
So, baby, I can hear kids screaming.

2400
03:13:38.12 --> 03:13:40.12
They don't understand why this is happening to them.

2401
03:13:40.12 --> 03:13:42.12
I can hear mothers screaming.

2402
03:13:42.12 --> 03:13:49.12
Mothers that are punctured by fragments of a metal and can barely hold their lungs.

2403
03:13:49.12 --> 03:13:50.12
Their screams are the sounds.

2404
03:13:50.12 --> 03:13:56.12
Only a parent can understand of desperately wanting to help your children, but not knowing what to do to help them.

2405
03:13:56.12 --> 03:14:02.12
Or in some cases, knowing it is too late to help them.

2406
03:14:02.12 --> 03:14:04.12
Every scream tears me apart.

2407
03:14:04.12 --> 03:14:08.12
After everything I've been through, I thought my soul was dead.

2408
03:14:08.12 --> 03:14:11.12
I was as hollow as the foot of that grenade.

2409
03:14:11.12 --> 03:14:13.12
I thought there was nothing left.

2410
03:14:13.12 --> 03:14:15.12
It all comes flooding back.

2411
03:14:15.12 --> 03:14:18.12
I may raw nerve of emotion.

2412
03:14:18.12 --> 03:14:23.12
And each sound coming from that room burns me worse than anything that has ever happened to me.

2413
03:14:23.12 --> 03:14:28.12
Shame, horror, and guilt that what I have just done envelops me.

2414
03:14:28.12 --> 03:14:34.12
I've seen this before, in others as an EMT, the drunk driver that has killed someone.

2415
03:14:34.12 --> 03:14:46.12
They sat there on those street corners crying, trying to sort out in their heads, the disparity between who they thought they were, a decent person, and what they had just done.

2416
03:14:46.12 --> 03:14:49.12
But I cannot stop and cry.

2417
03:14:49.12 --> 03:14:51.12
I have to move.

2418
03:14:51.12 --> 03:14:55.12
Keller and I flow into the courtyard with the PKM out of commission.

2419
03:14:55.12 --> 03:14:59.12
The RG gets more aggressive, and I see the wall start tumbling down.

2420
03:14:59.12 --> 03:15:03.12
Everything is moving fast, and Keller and I do not want to lose momentum.

2421
03:15:03.12 --> 03:15:05.12
I flow right, my flows left.

2422
03:15:05.12 --> 03:15:11.12
The mission, this mission never would have happened, and I rack and goes against doctrine in any unit.

2423
03:15:11.12 --> 03:15:15.12
And I rack, we had a whole company of sift working together to clear buildings.

2424
03:15:15.12 --> 03:15:22.12
A normal infantry would have at least four on a door, followed by another fire team right behind them at a minimum.

2425
03:15:22.12 --> 03:15:28.12
With another squad or platoon in support, we have a whole compound to clear, and it's just me and Keller.

2426
03:15:28.12 --> 03:15:30.12
That's it.

2427
03:15:30.12 --> 03:15:34.12
When I hit the first doorway, I instantly see food everywhere.

2428
03:15:34.12 --> 03:15:36.12
It's a kitchen.

2429
03:15:36.12 --> 03:15:41.12
I can smell the tea kettle with the clove tea that everyone hear drinks.

2430
03:15:41.12 --> 03:15:42.12
It has just been made.

2431
03:15:42.12 --> 03:15:44.12
I can smell right now as I write this.

2432
03:15:44.12 --> 03:15:46.12
It's amazing how smell stays with you.

2433
03:15:46.12 --> 03:15:53.12
You can forget details and images, specific words and conversations, but the smell of a moment is forever.

2434
03:15:53.12 --> 03:15:56.12
Curry clove.

2435
03:15:56.12 --> 03:15:59.12
The screams are louder now, and I move toward them.

2436
03:15:59.12 --> 03:16:04.12
I follow a hallway to a 90-degree turn, and as I hit the edge of that corner,

2437
03:16:04.12 --> 03:16:08.12
I get the first traces of smoke and dust from the grenade.

2438
03:16:08.12 --> 03:16:18.12
At this point, I'm in this room somewhere between 30-60 seconds from the moment it exploded, and the scene is awful.

2439
03:16:18.12 --> 03:16:21.12
It is worse than I expected.

2440
03:16:21.12 --> 03:16:28.12
When you throw a grenade into a building that has walls to feet thick, all that over pressure has nowhere to go.

2441
03:16:28.12 --> 03:16:34.12
This is in America where the pressure will break the dry wall or blow the door off.

2442
03:16:34.12 --> 03:16:37.12
Their bodies took the brunt of it.

2443
03:16:37.12 --> 03:16:43.12
There are two women, six kids, and an old man inside.

2444
03:16:43.12 --> 03:16:51.12
I am once again that kid standing on the street looking at a crashed church of Anne, so desperately wanting to help,

2445
03:16:51.12 --> 03:16:54.12
but not knowing where to start.

2446
03:16:54.12 --> 03:17:01.12
Except this time, in addition to being the guy who so desperately wants to fix it all,

2447
03:17:01.12 --> 03:17:05.12
I am also the guy who crashed the van.

2448
03:17:05.12 --> 03:17:08.12
I scream for the gingenator to come and help.

2449
03:17:08.12 --> 03:17:11.12
Why the fuck is an in here?

2450
03:17:11.12 --> 03:17:15.12
Because there is no reason for him to be here, but I need this fix.

2451
03:17:15.12 --> 03:17:18.12
I cannot have this on my ledger.

2452
03:17:18.12 --> 03:17:22.12
They have to be okay.

2453
03:17:22.12 --> 03:17:28.12
He screams at me to come back and man the gun because he is running the grenade launcher and cannot abandon his post.

2454
03:17:28.12 --> 03:17:30.12
I take one last look at the room.

2455
03:17:30.12 --> 03:17:31.12
It is so dark.

2456
03:17:31.12 --> 03:17:35.12
The floors are dirt and dust floats in the air.

2457
03:17:35.12 --> 03:17:39.12
I am standing in a real life nightmare, a horror film.

2458
03:17:39.12 --> 03:17:44.12
The smell of death, empty bowels, and vomit hangs in the air.

2459
03:17:44.12 --> 03:17:47.12
The hot machine gun is right there.

2460
03:17:47.12 --> 03:17:49.12
Someone was shooting at Goddam.

2461
03:17:49.12 --> 03:17:55.12
Who? The old man, one of the women, someone else.

2462
03:17:55.12 --> 03:17:58.12
Everyone that can scream is screaming.

2463
03:17:58.12 --> 03:18:02.12
Some aren't all going to make it.

2464
03:18:02.12 --> 03:18:06.12
I did this.

2465
03:18:06.12 --> 03:18:23.12
I am the bad guy.

2466
03:18:23.12 --> 03:18:37.12
I am the bad guy.

2467
03:18:37.12 --> 03:18:44.12
The couple of seconds before that, my goalball.

2468
03:18:44.12 --> 03:18:50.12
As we approach that door, that started to get disintegrated from the machine gunfire.

2469
03:18:50.12 --> 03:18:53.12
I don't know if I can make any sense of it.

2470
03:18:53.12 --> 03:18:56.12
We approach the door on the right side.

2471
03:18:56.12 --> 03:18:57.12
He is on the left side.

2472
03:18:57.12 --> 03:19:00.12
I reached for the handle to push this door and the courtyard open.

2473
03:19:00.12 --> 03:19:04.12
I am an athletic green brazer.

2474
03:19:04.12 --> 03:19:06.12
I am not small people.

2475
03:19:06.12 --> 03:19:10.12
I fall away from the door as the door starts shredding.

2476
03:19:10.12 --> 03:19:13.12
The machine gunfire starts to ripen through it.

2477
03:19:13.12 --> 03:19:14.12
I don't know what he heard.

2478
03:19:14.12 --> 03:19:15.12
I don't know what he smelled.

2479
03:19:15.12 --> 03:19:16.12
I don't know what happened.

2480
03:19:16.12 --> 03:19:18.12
I don't know if he was a six-centing thing.

2481
03:19:18.12 --> 03:19:22.12
He knows me a heartbeat before the door starts disintegrating.

2482
03:19:22.12 --> 03:19:25.12
That is the door that I throw the grenade through.

2483
03:19:25.12 --> 03:19:31.12
As he peels off to try and find, Mike comes up and we end up clearing through that building.

2484
03:19:31.12 --> 03:19:34.12
The grenade goes off.

2485
03:19:34.12 --> 03:19:37.12
That is it.

2486
03:19:37.12 --> 03:19:44.12
It is over pressure that shoots tiny little projectiles of shrapnel in every direction.

2487
03:19:44.12 --> 03:19:49.12
Indiscriminately, traveling in whatever direction and trajectory that they have.

2488
03:19:49.12 --> 03:19:58.12
That Iranian, that was in that machine gun position, had body bunkered himself with women and children.

2489
03:19:58.12 --> 03:20:02.12
For them, it is a win-win for them.

2490
03:20:02.12 --> 03:20:04.12
We hurt civilians.

2491
03:20:04.12 --> 03:20:07.12
It is a win for them.

2492
03:20:07.12 --> 03:20:11.12
Or they are protected by these civilians.

2493
03:20:11.12 --> 03:20:14.12
It is a win for them.

2494
03:20:14.12 --> 03:20:17.12
A different type of evil.

2495
03:20:17.12 --> 03:20:21.12
As a...

2496
03:20:21.12 --> 03:20:29.12
I've been attacked about this as if there was any burvato or bragadosh pride in what happened in this.

2497
03:20:29.12 --> 03:20:30.12
Like, there is not.

2498
03:20:30.12 --> 03:20:34.12
No, there is absolute pain.

2499
03:20:34.12 --> 03:20:36.12
But this is war.

2500
03:20:36.12 --> 03:20:45.12
As we have people that volunteer to go and do things, travel overseas or go to Ukraine and fight for them.

2501
03:20:45.12 --> 03:20:47.12
You have seen war.

2502
03:20:47.12 --> 03:20:48.12
I have seen war.

2503
03:20:48.12 --> 03:20:56.12
I am always just like even in America where people are talking about real revolution and as a brawl.

2504
03:20:56.12 --> 03:20:58.12
You don't know.

2505
03:20:58.12 --> 03:21:01.12
This is war.

2506
03:21:01.12 --> 03:21:08.12
It is the worst thing that we can do to each other.

2507
03:21:08.12 --> 03:21:16.12
The... a friend of mine did this show on the history channel.

2508
03:21:16.12 --> 03:21:21.12
It is now... they changed the name of it, but it is called the war fighters.

2509
03:21:21.12 --> 03:21:23.12
And I got interviewed for this show.

2510
03:21:23.12 --> 03:21:29.12
It is about to highlight Mark Lee who was in my task unit who was killed in Iraq.

2511
03:21:29.12 --> 03:21:33.12
But it is... they interviewed us.

2512
03:21:33.12 --> 03:21:34.12
He did a great job.

2513
03:21:34.12 --> 03:21:36.12
The guy that put it together.

2514
03:21:36.12 --> 03:21:37.12
And it is awesome.

2515
03:21:37.12 --> 03:21:38.12
It is an awesome program.

2516
03:21:38.12 --> 03:21:40.12
But there is this one part that they edited out.

2517
03:21:40.12 --> 03:21:42.12
Let me talk.

2518
03:21:42.12 --> 03:21:44.12
And they are asking me about...

2519
03:21:44.12 --> 03:21:45.12
They are asking me about war.

2520
03:21:45.12 --> 03:21:47.12
I don't even know what they are asking me.

2521
03:21:47.12 --> 03:21:48.12
But I do know what I said.

2522
03:21:48.12 --> 03:21:52.12
I start talking about if you are going to go to war, you have to have the will.

2523
03:21:52.12 --> 03:21:54.12
And there are two wills that you have to have.

2524
03:21:54.12 --> 03:21:57.12
The will to kill and the will to die.

2525
03:21:57.12 --> 03:22:01.12
And when I talk about the will to kill, what I said was,

2526
03:22:01.12 --> 03:22:04.12
you have to have the will to kill not just the enemy.

2527
03:22:04.12 --> 03:22:07.12
Because when you go to war, civilians are going to die.

2528
03:22:07.12 --> 03:22:10.12
And if you think you are going to somehow avoid that,

2529
03:22:10.12 --> 03:22:15.12
that you are so good or that things are going to go your way and it is not going to happen you are wrong.

2530
03:22:15.12 --> 03:22:18.12
So if you are going to go to war, you...

2531
03:22:18.12 --> 03:22:20.12
Yeah, you have to have the will to kill the enemy.

2532
03:22:20.12 --> 03:22:23.12
That might not be that hard to fathom or to figure out.

2533
03:22:23.12 --> 03:22:30.12
But you have to realize that civilians are 100% going to die if you go to war.

2534
03:22:30.12 --> 03:22:33.12
And then obviously the other part of the will is the will to die.

2535
03:22:33.12 --> 03:22:37.12
Because once again if you think you are going to go to war and you are not going to lose in your friends,

2536
03:22:37.12 --> 03:22:39.12
well you are wrong.

2537
03:22:39.12 --> 03:22:44.12
And you think you are not going to lose any brave American souls you are wrong.

2538
03:22:44.12 --> 03:22:46.12
So this is an example of that.

2539
03:22:46.12 --> 03:22:52.12
This is another thing I learned so much from the troops that I work with.

2540
03:22:52.12 --> 03:22:55.12
And the conventional forces that I work with.

2541
03:22:55.12 --> 03:22:58.12
The first, the 506, they had an expression that they said,

2542
03:22:58.12 --> 03:23:06.12
Good shot bad result, which means, hey, this soldier was doing everything that they were supposed to do.

2543
03:23:06.12 --> 03:23:10.12
They took a shot that was completely authorized that made sense that followed the Arruis.

2544
03:23:10.12 --> 03:23:13.12
And it so happens that there was collateral damage.

2545
03:23:13.12 --> 03:23:14.12
There was a civilian killed.

2546
03:23:14.12 --> 03:23:16.12
It wasn't what it looked like.

2547
03:23:16.12 --> 03:23:18.12
And it was a good shot.

2548
03:23:18.12 --> 03:23:22.12
And they did the right thing, but the result is bad.

2549
03:23:22.12 --> 03:23:26.12
And that's when I was reading that, I was like, man, good shot bad result.

2550
03:23:26.12 --> 03:23:29.12
Like you have to do, you have to take that risk.

2551
03:23:29.12 --> 03:23:32.12
Otherwise everything goes to shit.

2552
03:23:32.12 --> 03:23:39.12
Then make it an easier though.

2553
03:23:39.12 --> 03:23:49.12
When you, when people when shit like that happens,

2554
03:23:49.12 --> 03:23:56.12
what point do you think you started processing that at a deeper level, like thinking yourself,

2555
03:23:56.12 --> 03:23:59.12
trying to understand it?

2556
03:23:59.12 --> 03:24:00.12
Man.

2557
03:24:00.12 --> 03:24:07.12
I want to finally made it when the generator and I switched positions.

2558
03:24:07.12 --> 03:24:12.12
Now, I'm purred in much seen red for a week.

2559
03:24:12.12 --> 03:24:15.12
You know, I'm just like in fight mode.

2560
03:24:15.12 --> 03:24:22.12
And I get inside of the RG and I'm on the grenade, I see squirters coming out of these buildings.

2561
03:24:22.12 --> 03:24:26.12
And I'm just like laying waste to these people.

2562
03:24:26.12 --> 03:24:32.12
When we make it fire based in a condo, and I'm avoiding going to the medic shed.

2563
03:24:32.12 --> 03:24:35.12
By all me, I'm not, I'm not getting near it.

2564
03:24:35.12 --> 03:24:37.12
I'm not even looking over to that side of the base.

2565
03:24:37.12 --> 03:24:44.12
I'm playing sniper hopping up on top of roofs, smack and dudes that are trying to embed ideas around the base.

2566
03:24:44.12 --> 03:24:51.12
I'm just like doing every activity that I can do to keep myself occupied from dealing with what is in the Med shed,

2567
03:24:51.12 --> 03:24:55.12
which is all of these women and children that they're trying to save.

2568
03:24:55.12 --> 03:25:03.12
I finally go down there and I get to hold one of the children that was wounded.

2569
03:25:03.12 --> 03:25:13.12
That's when I started finding purpose again, you know, that killing is not going to heal it.

2570
03:25:13.12 --> 03:25:15.12
It might help a little bit.

2571
03:25:15.12 --> 03:25:17.12
Sweat is not going to heal it.

2572
03:25:17.12 --> 03:25:18.12
It's going to help a little bit.

2573
03:25:18.12 --> 03:25:20.12
Sleep is not going to heal it.

2574
03:25:20.12 --> 03:25:21.12
It's going to help a little bit.

2575
03:25:21.12 --> 03:25:24.12
You know what, going into and doing good and going and figuring out.

2576
03:25:24.12 --> 03:25:26.12
What is the next thing to do?

2577
03:25:26.12 --> 03:25:29.12
Like, that's really going to heal it.

2578
03:25:29.12 --> 03:25:30.12
You know, that's going to help.

2579
03:25:30.12 --> 03:25:39.12
So this ended up being a really significant kind of change in my approach to how to ideal with post-traumatic stress.

2580
03:25:39.12 --> 03:25:41.12
How do I, you know, mental health?

2581
03:25:41.12 --> 03:25:44.12
How do I, you know, it's not any of these little things.

2582
03:25:44.12 --> 03:25:52.12
It's all of them exercise food, fitness, relationships, and also facing those demons.

2583
03:25:52.12 --> 03:26:02.12
You know, like I went into that and I picked up this damaged wounded child that I damaged and sat there and faced a face held.

2584
03:26:02.12 --> 03:26:04.12
Helped this child.

2585
03:26:04.12 --> 03:26:09.12
And, you know, smelled it, felt it.

2586
03:26:09.12 --> 03:26:11.12
It's a little tiny heartbeat.

2587
03:26:11.12 --> 03:26:14.12
You know, twice that of ours.

2588
03:26:14.12 --> 03:26:19.12
So I don't know how I faced it.

2589
03:26:19.12 --> 03:26:23.12
I don't know how, I'm sure it's not fully healed.

2590
03:26:23.12 --> 03:26:26.12
You know, the, you're reading it still is just like a gut punch.

2591
03:26:26.12 --> 03:26:32.12
When I read it on the audio book, then I had to stop 10, 15 times just to get through it.

2592
03:26:32.12 --> 03:26:35.12
You know, I'd get up on walk, I'd come back.

2593
03:26:35.12 --> 03:26:42.12
And that poor audio guy having to deal with, you know, this man child crying in between every sentence.

2594
03:26:42.12 --> 03:26:50.12
Yeah, do it better.

2595
03:26:50.12 --> 03:27:00.12
You, you get in pretty much, you get to anaconda, you sleep, you shower, you reload, your Sergeant Major contacts you.

2596
03:27:00.12 --> 03:27:06.12
And he just wants you to get on the black off and fly back to canterheart.

2597
03:27:06.12 --> 03:27:11.12
And the choice is yours.

2598
03:27:11.12 --> 03:27:13.12
What you want to do.

2599
03:27:13.12 --> 03:27:24.12
And I mean, by all, by all, meaning full consideration, the trip back is going to be the same as the trip out.

2600
03:27:24.12 --> 03:27:30.12
Maybe even harger because now the enemy knows you're going to become a back.

2601
03:27:30.12 --> 03:27:43.12
So you have a convenient little out for yourself, a convenient little opportunity to not have to ride this convoy back.

2602
03:27:43.12 --> 03:27:47.12
And that's a decision point for you.

2603
03:27:47.12 --> 03:27:51.12
And I read a little book for this part.

2604
03:27:51.12 --> 03:27:55.12
You say, I have to see this mission through.

2605
03:27:55.12 --> 03:27:58.12
I thought about it all night while holding that little girl.

2606
03:27:58.12 --> 03:28:03.12
There is a recurring pattern that is forming in my life and I don't like it.

2607
03:28:03.12 --> 03:28:09.12
I don't necessarily run for my problems, but I'm definitely not addressing them either.

2608
03:28:09.12 --> 03:28:15.12
I've always found a path around the thing that scares me, hurt me, or upsets me.

2609
03:28:15.12 --> 03:28:21.12
It is the same unhealthy coping mechanism that I've used ever since Jared died.

2610
03:28:21.12 --> 03:28:22.12
Firemen problems?

2611
03:28:22.12 --> 03:28:23.12
Cool.

2612
03:28:23.12 --> 03:28:24.12
No big deal.

2613
03:28:24.12 --> 03:28:25.12
I'll become a cop.

2614
03:28:25.12 --> 03:28:28.12
I'll be coming to my chances of becoming a cop because I paint ball to kid.

2615
03:28:28.12 --> 03:28:29.12
Cool.

2616
03:28:29.12 --> 03:28:30.12
I'll go in the army.

2617
03:28:30.12 --> 03:28:35.12
And now my boss has teed up a perfect scenario for me to do that again.

2618
03:28:35.12 --> 03:28:45.12
I can leave right now safely and go on another mission with the brits or the French or get some cool combat patches from their militaries and pad my resume.

2619
03:28:45.12 --> 03:28:47.12
No one would judge me.

2620
03:28:47.12 --> 03:28:52.12
My boss is literally telling me he would like me to head back.

2621
03:28:52.12 --> 03:28:55.12
I do not want to go back into that valley.

2622
03:28:55.12 --> 03:28:57.12
I am scared as hell.

2623
03:28:57.12 --> 03:29:00.12
But I can't shake that night and I rack.

2624
03:29:00.12 --> 03:29:06.12
When John McFee made me fight the entire team after I mouth-though.

2625
03:29:06.12 --> 03:29:08.12
I said all the right things back then.

2626
03:29:08.12 --> 03:29:13.12
I said I understood that the team can accomplish anything but the individuals weak.

2627
03:29:13.12 --> 03:29:16.12
But I also thought that I'd beat no better than them.

2628
03:29:16.12 --> 03:29:20.12
And even though they all beat me up, no single one of them could have taken me.

2629
03:29:20.12 --> 03:29:25.12
I let myself cope with the humiliation by protecting my ego.

2630
03:29:25.12 --> 03:29:31.12
I ignored the reality that no one man, at least of all me, is that big of a deal.

2631
03:29:31.12 --> 03:29:36.12
I'd heard the saying before and thought I understood them.

2632
03:29:36.12 --> 03:29:38.12
You don't leave a man behind.

2633
03:29:38.12 --> 03:29:41.12
You fight for the man next to you.

2634
03:29:41.12 --> 03:29:52.12
But I didn't understand them until this moment.

2635
03:29:52.12 --> 03:29:55.12
There's always an easy way out.

2636
03:29:55.12 --> 03:29:57.12
There is.

2637
03:29:57.12 --> 03:30:04.12
In marriage, you know, you're traveling on work and you go down to the lobby.

2638
03:30:04.12 --> 03:30:06.12
You shouldn't have gone to the lobby.

2639
03:30:06.12 --> 03:30:08.12
You should have gone to the gym.

2640
03:30:08.12 --> 03:30:10.12
You walk through the lobby, you go to the bar.

2641
03:30:10.12 --> 03:30:11.12
You shouldn't have gone to the bar.

2642
03:30:11.12 --> 03:30:14.12
You should have walked through the lobby, got in your car and gone to a geogitsu gym.

2643
03:30:14.12 --> 03:30:16.12
If you did it, you get there.

2644
03:30:16.12 --> 03:30:18.12
There's a girl sitting down at the end.

2645
03:30:18.12 --> 03:30:19.12
She's a flight attendant.

2646
03:30:19.12 --> 03:30:21.12
You know, you could have not talked to her.

2647
03:30:21.12 --> 03:30:22.12
But you did.

2648
03:30:22.12 --> 03:30:25.12
There's always an easy option.

2649
03:30:25.12 --> 03:30:30.12
And that hard right is is, you know, so hard.

2650
03:30:30.12 --> 03:30:31.12
It's called the hard right.

2651
03:30:31.12 --> 03:30:39.12
And you know that path that the high road is a lonely road that feels so destitute from

2652
03:30:39.12 --> 03:30:41.12
anything else.

2653
03:30:41.12 --> 03:30:43.12
That is the only road to be on.

2654
03:30:43.12 --> 03:30:47.12
You know, and this is one of those moments that it was so crystal clear.

2655
03:30:47.12 --> 03:30:48.12
It was so black and white.

2656
03:30:48.12 --> 03:30:54.12
And that doesn't happen very often in war or the where you're served on this platter.

2657
03:30:54.12 --> 03:30:57.12
These options of right and wrong.

2658
03:30:57.12 --> 03:31:01.12
And I had every excuse, you know, like I can fake this injury.

2659
03:31:01.12 --> 03:31:05.12
Man, I would have got selected, but, you know, I rolled my ankle.

2660
03:31:05.12 --> 03:31:06.12
Oh, you didn't.

2661
03:31:06.12 --> 03:31:07.12
You quit.

2662
03:31:07.12 --> 03:31:08.12
You know, like, man, I just got to go to the gym.

2663
03:31:08.12 --> 03:31:12.12
Man, I, I, I, I had my wife not been mean to me.

2664
03:31:12.12 --> 03:31:14.12
Had she not talked smack before I went on this trip.

2665
03:31:14.12 --> 03:31:17.12
You know, I went to, no, you know, this is on you, man.

2666
03:31:17.12 --> 03:31:22.12
So every single time that easy option, you know, you said the convenient choice.

2667
03:31:22.12 --> 03:31:24.12
It's always right there.

2668
03:31:24.12 --> 03:31:35.12
And, you know, for 20 something years, it was so simple just to make the easy wrong.

2669
03:31:35.12 --> 03:31:39.12
You wrap up this chapter. You say, that mission to anaconda defined me.

2670
03:31:39.12 --> 03:31:41.12
And in many ways still does.

2671
03:31:41.12 --> 03:31:43.12
It was the honor of my life to serve with these men.

2672
03:31:43.12 --> 03:31:47.12
Every member of the ODA that fought through the valley received at least a bronze star.

2673
03:31:47.12 --> 03:31:49.12
Every member of the Czech was awarded.

2674
03:31:49.12 --> 03:31:53.12
The Czechs was awarded the silver star with one guy receiving the Czech Medal of honor.

2675
03:31:53.12 --> 03:31:54.12
Right.

2676
03:31:54.12 --> 03:31:57.12
An extraordinary number of men were awarded the Purple Heart.

2677
03:31:57.12 --> 03:32:02.12
When I landed in Afghanistan, I wanted these things on my uniform.

2678
03:32:02.12 --> 03:32:06.12
I wanted the bling that told people I was a bad ass.

2679
03:32:06.12 --> 03:32:08.12
Now I felt like I didn't even deserve any of it.

2680
03:32:08.12 --> 03:32:11.12
And I didn't want it if it was offered.

2681
03:32:11.12 --> 03:32:15.12
I didn't even report my wartime injuries to my actual chain of command.

2682
03:32:15.12 --> 03:32:20.12
Everything I had done thus far, range of school, sniper school, deployments fighting.

2683
03:32:20.12 --> 03:32:23.12
We're no longer accomplishments meant to stand alone.

2684
03:32:23.12 --> 03:32:26.12
They were tools to make me better.

2685
03:32:26.12 --> 03:32:30.12
And the only thing I proved on this deployment was that I wasn't good enough.

2686
03:32:30.12 --> 03:32:33.12
And I never wanted to not be good enough again.

2687
03:32:33.12 --> 03:32:38.12
I decided as I board the plane to fly back home to Fayetteville.

2688
03:32:38.12 --> 03:32:43.12
Just as the UFC fight for the troops event is starting at Fort Bragg.

2689
03:32:43.12 --> 03:32:47.12
That I am going to spend the rest of my career stacking the deck in my favor.

2690
03:32:47.12 --> 03:32:51.12
So the men around me will never have a liability in their midst.

2691
03:32:51.12 --> 03:32:55.12
I will never live up to being the man I once thought I was.

2692
03:32:55.12 --> 03:32:58.12
And I will certainly never be perfect.

2693
03:32:58.12 --> 03:33:01.12
But I can be better.

2694
03:33:05.12 --> 03:33:07.12
Lessons are sinking at this point.

2695
03:33:07.12 --> 03:33:08.12
They're getting there.

2696
03:33:08.12 --> 03:33:16.12
It is tragic and embarrassing that this is what it takes for me to start learning.

2697
03:33:16.12 --> 03:33:20.12
You know, these are hard lessons.

2698
03:33:20.12 --> 03:33:26.12
But now, you know, 15 years removed from some of this.

2699
03:33:26.12 --> 03:33:29.12
Those, these are lessons that I revisit.

2700
03:33:29.12 --> 03:33:33.12
You know, I'm going back to that well all the time to drink from it.

2701
03:33:33.12 --> 03:33:38.12
You know, the drink, the, that well of embarrassment, that well of shame, that, that well of pain,

2702
03:33:38.12 --> 03:33:40.12
that the memory of mistake.

2703
03:33:40.12 --> 03:33:42.12
And that's fuel.

2704
03:33:42.12 --> 03:33:47.12
You know, it's fuel that motivates when I'm like, man, I want to get up.

2705
03:33:47.12 --> 03:33:49.12
I don't want to go to this dumb resistance court.

2706
03:33:49.12 --> 03:33:52.12
You want to need to take a 40 hours resistance course.

2707
03:33:52.12 --> 03:33:54.12
Okay.

2708
03:33:54.12 --> 03:33:57.12
No, I'll do that.

2709
03:33:57.12 --> 03:34:00.12
You know.

2710
03:34:00.12 --> 03:34:06.12
Um, you get back and you're back in the fight game.

2711
03:34:06.12 --> 03:34:09.12
You've got to hold another career going, you know,

2712
03:34:09.12 --> 03:34:11.12
you're on me, but you also have this other career going.

2713
03:34:11.12 --> 03:34:14.12
You get a fight against Nick Thompson and strike force.

2714
03:34:14.12 --> 03:34:19.12
And at this point, you're training at Team Rock in Fayetteville.

2715
03:34:19.12 --> 03:34:22.12
This is like a hard, but basic gym.

2716
03:34:22.12 --> 03:34:25.12
You guys are going hard.

2717
03:34:25.12 --> 03:34:26.12
Nick, you beat on June 16th, 2009.

2718
03:34:26.12 --> 03:34:27.12
You beat Nick Thompson.

2719
03:34:27.12 --> 03:34:28.12
He taps from strikes.

2720
03:34:28.12 --> 03:34:31.12
You're a positional grappler.

2721
03:34:31.12 --> 03:34:33.12
You know about the sometimes you just put a dude to a place.

2722
03:34:33.12 --> 03:34:35.12
He can't move.

2723
03:34:35.12 --> 03:34:36.12
Yeah, that's hard.

2724
03:34:36.12 --> 03:34:37.12
He stuck there.

2725
03:34:37.12 --> 03:34:39.12
And when somebody's able to sit there and rain down punches on you.

2726
03:34:39.12 --> 03:34:42.12
And, you know, you can't get your arms free to tap.

2727
03:34:42.12 --> 03:34:47.12
You know, you can't get your arms free to tap.

2728
03:34:47.12 --> 03:34:52.12
You're just, you're just looking for a way out.

2729
03:34:52.12 --> 03:34:53.12
Yeah.

2730
03:34:53.12 --> 03:34:55.12
Dominant grappling.

2731
03:34:55.12 --> 03:34:58.12
The, the, at this point, now this is like the first little

2732
03:34:58.12 --> 03:35:00.12
friction we start to see with the arm.

2733
03:35:00.12 --> 03:35:01.12
At least the, am I right in that?

2734
03:35:01.12 --> 03:35:06.12
Like the arm is now saying, construct forces, you know, on TV and stuff like this.

2735
03:35:06.12 --> 03:35:09.12
And the army does not want you doing MMA.

2736
03:35:09.12 --> 03:35:09.12
No.

2737
03:35:09.12 --> 03:35:10.12
Which is the arm.

2738
03:35:10.12 --> 03:35:14.12
And the arm is now saying, you know, on TV and stuff like this.

2739
03:35:14.12 --> 03:35:16.12
And the army does not want you doing MMA.

2740
03:35:16.12 --> 03:35:20.12
No, which is a crazy thing to think about, man.

2741
03:35:20.12 --> 03:35:27.12
What better representation for the US military than to have a green beret

2742
03:35:27.12 --> 03:35:33.12
out fighting in mixed martial arts on TV and winning and kicking people's asses?

2743
03:35:33.12 --> 03:35:35.12
How is that not good?

2744
03:35:35.12 --> 03:35:38.12
I can curve like I agree with you.

2745
03:35:38.12 --> 03:35:41.12
But the chain of command ultimately, like they didn't.

2746
03:35:41.12 --> 03:35:44.12
So, you know, the motto of the green berets is the quite professionals.

2747
03:35:44.12 --> 03:35:51.12
And when you're, when you are a main event on show time, you know, like, that's not quite it.

2748
03:35:51.12 --> 03:35:58.12
You know, you, didn't, it wasn't this fight or was it this fight?

2749
03:35:58.12 --> 03:36:01.12
Were they actually announced, do you know, you said, hey, I'm Tim Kennedy.

2750
03:36:01.12 --> 03:36:05.12
I'm a, you know, a wrestler and a mixed martial artist from Team Rock.

2751
03:36:05.12 --> 03:36:06.12
And they're like, okay, cool.

2752
03:36:06.12 --> 03:36:09.12
And then they announced you as like Tim Kennedy's special forces range.

2753
03:36:09.12 --> 03:36:10.12
It's my personal.

2754
03:36:10.12 --> 03:36:15.12
I don't know who told him, okay, I didn't tell him this.

2755
03:36:15.12 --> 03:36:17.12
You know, but they, they had done figured it out.

2756
03:36:17.12 --> 03:36:21.12
You, you were a head of your time with that though, because now, you know,

2757
03:36:21.12 --> 03:36:26.12
15 years down the line, the army, Marine Corps, they sponsor, you know,

2758
03:36:26.12 --> 03:36:32.12
Timers on, you know, on every UFC fight, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a paved the way for,

2759
03:36:32.12 --> 03:36:37.12
we have professional gamers, we have professional fishermen, you know, we have professional athletes.

2760
03:36:37.12 --> 03:36:39.12
We didn't know how to do it then.

2761
03:36:39.12 --> 03:36:41.12
And we're in the middle of war.

2762
03:36:41.12 --> 03:36:41.12
Right.

2763
03:36:41.12 --> 03:36:45.12
So I do get it, you know, like, how, how can you go?

2764
03:36:45.12 --> 03:36:50.12
They didn't know that they're going to have such a recruiting problem in two years from that moment.

2765
03:36:50.12 --> 03:36:53.12
Like in two years from then, they're like in a bad position.

2766
03:36:53.12 --> 03:36:55.12
But at the time, teams are full,

2767
03:36:55.12 --> 03:37:00.12
dudes want to go to war, they're not burnt out yet, you know, they're not quitting.

2768
03:37:00.12 --> 03:37:04.12
They're not going to find other jobs outside of SF because they're not ready to go on

2769
03:37:04.12 --> 03:37:05.12
their knife deployment.

2770
03:37:05.12 --> 03:37:09.12
This is before all that, this is peak war.

2771
03:37:09.12 --> 03:37:12.12
And then they have this dude that's moonlighting fighting.

2772
03:37:12.12 --> 03:37:17.12
So, you know, while I say, I don't understand how short-sighted they were,

2773
03:37:17.12 --> 03:37:22.12
I also understand, you know, if you were the commander and you're sitting there and you have one of your studs,

2774
03:37:22.12 --> 03:37:28.12
that's on the weekends, going off to Atlantic City and fighting in a MMA bout.

2775
03:37:28.12 --> 03:37:30.12
What is it even legal right now?

2776
03:37:30.12 --> 03:37:33.12
I guess it is in that state, you know, but John McCain is sitting there being like,

2777
03:37:33.12 --> 03:37:38.12
oh, it's not legal in Arizona, you know, and so it's, I do also get it.

2778
03:37:38.12 --> 03:37:41.12
Yeah, I guess I can kind of get it to you.

2779
03:37:41.12 --> 03:37:43.12
But it sucks.

2780
03:37:43.12 --> 03:37:44.12
It sucks.

2781
03:37:44.12 --> 03:37:48.12
Dude, I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it to you.

2782
03:37:48.12 --> 03:37:52.12
You know, you got great advice, Ben Reels, who's a green beret.

2783
03:37:52.12 --> 03:37:53.12
I'll brother.

2784
03:37:53.12 --> 03:37:57.12
Yeah, dude, he gave you such solid advice.

2785
03:37:57.12 --> 03:37:58.12
And I'm going to quote it.

2786
03:37:58.12 --> 03:38:02.12
He says, if the army loved you, they'd figure a way to make this work.

2787
03:38:02.12 --> 03:38:06.12
And he goes this whole comparison between, like, hey, if this was a girl,

2788
03:38:06.12 --> 03:38:10.12
and she really loved you, like you'd figure out a way to make this work.

2789
03:38:10.12 --> 03:38:13.12
He says, so if the army loved you, they'd figure out a way to make this work.

2790
03:38:13.12 --> 03:38:15.12
They'd make you sign a longer contract.

2791
03:38:15.12 --> 03:38:20.12
They'd outline recruiting things you can do, or deployments you're going to have to take.

2792
03:38:20.12 --> 03:38:23.12
What they're doing isn't love.

2793
03:38:23.12 --> 03:38:24.12
That's envy.

2794
03:38:24.12 --> 03:38:28.12
Are you going to let someone else's envy dictate your life?

2795
03:38:28.12 --> 03:38:31.12
That's of incredible advice.

2796
03:38:31.12 --> 03:38:37.12
And what makes it incredible advice to me is Ben Reels is obviously,

2797
03:38:37.12 --> 03:38:41.12
like a confident dude that was confident in his damn manhood to be like,

2798
03:38:41.12 --> 03:38:46.12
oh, my friend Tim Kenney's a badass, and I support him being a badass.

2799
03:38:46.12 --> 03:38:47.12
He's my boss.

2800
03:38:47.12 --> 03:38:50.12
He's my senior 18 Bravo.

2801
03:38:50.12 --> 03:38:53.12
You know, that is, so yeah, you're not wrong.

2802
03:38:53.12 --> 03:38:56.12
Man, the layers of his wisdom, and he had done a lot of living.

2803
03:38:56.12 --> 03:39:00.12
Good living in being in seventh group for that long, pre-war.

2804
03:39:00.12 --> 03:39:05.12
So he had the war on drugs, you know, Colombia, trips all up and down South American,

2805
03:39:05.12 --> 03:39:10.12
Central American, the Caribbean, during like seventh group doing some pretty

2806
03:39:10.12 --> 03:39:12.12
seventh group things.

2807
03:39:12.12 --> 03:39:14.12
So there's a lot of experience in there.

2808
03:39:14.12 --> 03:39:20.12
So when he just truthfully, and he was, he's a very stoic person.

2809
03:39:20.12 --> 03:39:23.12
Him to kind of just lay things out there.

2810
03:39:23.12 --> 03:39:27.12
Man, it was every single one of those words was just resounding in my brain,

2811
03:39:27.12 --> 03:39:30.12
because he meant it, like what a great human.

2812
03:39:30.12 --> 03:39:34.12
The envy part, like man.

2813
03:39:34.12 --> 03:39:37.12
It's not just hurts.

2814
03:39:37.12 --> 03:39:45.12
Like for someone not to see you do being successful and being in part of your community,

2815
03:39:45.12 --> 03:39:48.12
being like hell, yeah, instead being like with the L.S.

2816
03:39:48.12 --> 03:39:51.12
He doing that.

2817
03:39:51.12 --> 03:39:53.12
To me, that smells like envy.

2818
03:39:53.12 --> 03:39:54.12
It smells like jealousy.

2819
03:39:54.12 --> 03:39:55.12
That's what it smells like.

2820
03:39:55.12 --> 03:39:57.12
Those are good characteristics.

2821
03:39:57.12 --> 03:39:58.12
Yeah.

2822
03:39:58.12 --> 03:40:00.12
I was telling somebody the other day I was coming on here.

2823
03:40:00.12 --> 03:40:04.12
And they started shooting rounds off your bow about you, about your career,

2824
03:40:04.12 --> 03:40:08.12
and about how you are as a real leader.

2825
03:40:08.12 --> 03:40:11.12
And I'll say there's like listen to this person.

2826
03:40:11.12 --> 03:40:17.12
And every word that they say, it is so apparent how pathetic they are.

2827
03:40:17.12 --> 03:40:22.12
You know, how envious they are of your success and how jealous they are.

2828
03:40:22.12 --> 03:40:26.12
Any time that our veteran is talking negatively about a veteran, I'm always like,

2829
03:40:26.12 --> 03:40:28.12
what's going on with you?

2830
03:40:28.12 --> 03:40:33.12
But then when they start taking shots, shots that are usually unfounded and or fabricated,

2831
03:40:33.12 --> 03:40:39.12
or even worse, complete, just lies out of positions of envy.

2832
03:40:39.12 --> 03:40:42.12
That's a bad, it's a dangerous position to be coming from.

2833
03:40:42.12 --> 03:40:44.12
Yeah, it's a bummer, man.

2834
03:40:44.12 --> 03:40:49.12
It is, it's sad, you know, one of my buddies,

2835
03:40:49.12 --> 03:40:53.12
Stoner, he was trying to go to Princeton.

2836
03:40:53.12 --> 03:40:59.12
He's a single officer, and there was like this, your program where he could go to Princeton.

2837
03:40:59.12 --> 03:41:02.12
And he's, so he wasn't, he worked for me.

2838
03:41:02.12 --> 03:41:03.12
Now he wasn't working for me.

2839
03:41:03.12 --> 03:41:07.12
And he says, hey, you know, I want to go to this program to go to Princeton.

2840
03:41:07.12 --> 03:41:08.12
And he goes, what do you think?

2841
03:41:08.12 --> 03:41:10.12
And I go, it's freaking awesome. Why?

2842
03:41:10.12 --> 03:41:13.12
He goes, like, some other people are telling me that like, I shouldn't go.

2843
03:41:13.12 --> 03:41:16.12
And it's, it's going to be a bad move for my career.

2844
03:41:16.12 --> 03:41:20.12
And I was like, bro, who's telling you that?

2845
03:41:20.12 --> 03:41:22.12
Like, that's the most insane thing I've ever heard.

2846
03:41:22.12 --> 03:41:24.12
I was like, you know what that is? That's jealous.

2847
03:41:24.12 --> 03:41:28.12
That's someone thinking, oh, now this guy's got combat experience.

2848
03:41:28.12 --> 03:41:31.12
And he's also going to be a freaking Princeton guy.

2849
03:41:31.12 --> 03:41:34.12
Oh, shit, I can't compete without, I know you shouldn't go.

2850
03:41:34.12 --> 03:41:36.12
I was like, dude, a hundred percent go.

2851
03:41:36.12 --> 03:41:39.12
I go, you'll have my punk card when it comes to education.

2852
03:41:39.12 --> 03:41:41.12
You can be like, I went through an Ivy League school bitch.

2853
03:41:41.12 --> 03:41:44.12
He's like, cool, I'm going, and he ended up going.

2854
03:41:44.12 --> 03:41:48.12
But yeah, that's a bomber. It seems like there's, unfortunately,

2855
03:41:48.12 --> 03:41:50.12
some of that activity going on here.

2856
03:41:50.12 --> 03:41:53.12
It's cool to get a lip nistesto.

2857
03:41:53.12 --> 03:41:57.12
You know, I have a few friends that every time somebody,

2858
03:41:57.12 --> 03:41:58.12
I'll like name drop them.

2859
03:41:58.12 --> 03:42:01.12
And I know these people very, very well,

2860
03:42:01.12 --> 03:42:03.12
but they don't know how well I know them.

2861
03:42:03.12 --> 03:42:06.12
But they know, like, the public persona of this person.

2862
03:42:06.12 --> 03:42:09.12
And when they start just like, whackin' off about this person,

2863
03:42:09.12 --> 03:42:11.12
man, I know about you now.

2864
03:42:11.12 --> 03:42:12.12
Like, you done fucked up.

2865
03:42:12.12 --> 03:42:15.12
Like, I know that my little person is my lip nistesto.

2866
03:42:15.12 --> 03:42:18.12
I know is a great person that I know is a selfless servant

2867
03:42:18.12 --> 03:42:20.12
that is a good father that is faithful.

2868
03:42:20.12 --> 03:42:23.12
And you're like, you're listing all these things that I know to be,

2869
03:42:23.12 --> 03:42:24.12
to be lied.

2870
03:42:24.12 --> 03:42:25.12
I know for a fact to be lies.

2871
03:42:25.12 --> 03:42:28.12
And you're just regurgitating the same bullshit

2872
03:42:28.12 --> 03:42:29.12
that everybody else says.

2873
03:42:29.12 --> 03:42:31.12
It's like, got you, bro.

2874
03:42:31.12 --> 03:42:32.12
I got you number.

2875
03:42:32.12 --> 03:42:33.12
Give away that position.

2876
03:42:33.12 --> 03:42:34.12
Yeah.

2877
03:42:34.12 --> 03:42:36.12
That's a bomber, man.

2878
03:42:36.12 --> 03:42:39.12
Luckily for you, the Texas National Guard.

2879
03:42:39.12 --> 03:42:42.12
Nice, definitely.

2880
03:42:42.12 --> 03:42:45.12
The guard has been so good in so many ways.

2881
03:42:45.12 --> 03:42:50.12
You know, behind the tomb of the unknown soldier,

2882
03:42:50.12 --> 03:42:53.12
carved, like, etched in stone.

2883
03:42:53.12 --> 03:42:55.12
And it says, you, we don't accept the soldier

2884
03:42:55.12 --> 03:42:58.12
and lay aside the citizen.

2885
03:42:58.12 --> 03:43:01.12
That's so beautifully said.

2886
03:43:01.12 --> 03:43:04.12
And we always look to the soldier to the Marine

2887
03:43:04.12 --> 03:43:08.12
and we forget that that's a person, right?

2888
03:43:08.12 --> 03:43:10.12
That's the citizen first.

2889
03:43:10.12 --> 03:43:12.12
And we have, these, sometimes unrealized,

2890
03:43:12.12 --> 03:43:16.12
these unrealistic expectations about who this person,

2891
03:43:16.12 --> 03:43:18.12
who this citizen is and what they should be doing

2892
03:43:18.12 --> 03:43:20.12
and how they're going to behave in war.

2893
03:43:20.12 --> 03:43:23.12
And we take this, these expectations,

2894
03:43:23.12 --> 03:43:25.12
and we throw it in front of them,

2895
03:43:25.12 --> 03:43:26.12
and it's, it's not real.

2896
03:43:26.12 --> 03:43:28.12
You know, like that is a person first and foremost.

2897
03:43:28.12 --> 03:43:30.12
And it's a citizen that, you know, is married

2898
03:43:30.12 --> 03:43:33.12
and that has a family that wants to provide for their family.

2899
03:43:33.12 --> 03:43:34.12
And they have aspirations.

2900
03:43:34.12 --> 03:43:35.12
And they have goals.

2901
03:43:35.12 --> 03:43:36.12
And they're also human.

2902
03:43:36.12 --> 03:43:37.12
And they're also human.

2903
03:43:37.12 --> 03:43:40.12
And they're also human, they're also human.

2904
03:43:40.12 --> 03:43:41.12
They're as distinct.

2905
03:43:41.12 --> 03:43:42.12
And they don't do the right thing.

2906
03:43:42.12 --> 03:43:45.12
And, you know, behind the two-ounded soldier etched,

2907
03:43:45.12 --> 03:43:46.12
like that.

2908
03:43:46.12 --> 03:43:49.12
And it's, one of my favorite things to look back on.

2909
03:43:49.12 --> 03:43:51.12
Every time that I'm looking at whether I'm in a position of leadership

2910
03:43:51.12 --> 03:43:53.12
and I'm looking at the soldier by his behavior,

2911
03:43:53.12 --> 03:43:56.12
I always look at, like, who that person is first.

2912
03:43:56.12 --> 03:43:58.12
And the context of them is a citizen

2913
03:43:58.12 --> 03:44:00.12
as an individual and as a human.

2914
03:44:00.12 --> 03:44:04.12
Then I move on to what is happening as a soldier.

2915
03:44:04.12 --> 03:44:05.36
Yeah, yeah.

2916
03:44:06.72 --> 03:44:09.08
When we got to our money, there were groups on the troops

2917
03:44:09.08 --> 03:44:11.36
on the ground where National Guard unit out of Pennsylvania

2918
03:44:11.36 --> 03:44:15.08
and a bunch of other places, but man, what a bunch of studs.

2919
03:44:15.08 --> 03:44:16.08
Some of them.

2920
03:44:16.08 --> 03:44:18.84
Yeah, well for us, all of them, every one of them,

2921
03:44:18.84 --> 03:44:22.04
I, you know, like what they did and the lessons they taught us

2922
03:44:22.04 --> 03:44:26.08
and they were just awesome, awesome human beings.

2923
03:44:28.64 --> 03:44:33.64
And luckily, the National Guard is not technically the army.

2924
03:44:33.64 --> 03:44:37.64
So you were able to get in the National Guard,

2925
03:44:37.64 --> 03:44:40.52
which is the National Guard requires you to be a citizen.

2926
03:44:40.52 --> 03:44:43.000
So you have to have a full-time job,

2927
03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:46.52
because the National Guard, you know, you only work a percentage of the year.

2928
03:44:46.52 --> 03:44:51.08
You know, about a month out of the year, two months out of the year,

2929
03:44:51.08 --> 03:44:54.60
you end up working cumumably for the National Guard.

2930
03:44:54.60 --> 03:44:57.56
The rest of the time, you got to put food on the table.

2931
03:44:57.56 --> 03:45:00.28
And however you ever do that, that is your job.

2932
03:45:00.28 --> 03:45:06.12
You know, as some people are senators, some people are farmers,

2933
03:45:06.12 --> 03:45:08.000
yeah, please officers.

2934
03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:09.56
Work for the Department of State.

2935
03:45:09.56 --> 03:45:10.68
You know, lots of different jobs.

2936
03:45:10.68 --> 03:45:11.48
I was a fighter.

2937
03:45:11.48 --> 03:45:16.24
So you're trained, you're still trained in that team.

2938
03:45:16.24 --> 03:45:17.32
Where are you trained now?

2939
03:45:17.32 --> 03:45:19.64
Did you down in Texas now?

2940
03:45:19.64 --> 03:45:22.32
So I do one fight out of Texas when I fight Jocca,

2941
03:45:22.32 --> 03:45:25.16
and this is for the strike force.

2942
03:45:25.16 --> 03:45:27.000
Yep, for the side of the way, title.

2943
03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.000
And you lose.

2944
03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:30.000
Yep.

2945
03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:32.000
And now you say it so just clear,

2946
03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:33.60
you know, I barely lost that fight.

2947
03:45:33.60 --> 03:45:34.72
I know, you know what?

2948
03:45:34.72 --> 03:45:36.32
I think I won that fight.

2949
03:45:36.32 --> 03:45:37.72
Yeah, yeah, you just lost a Jason.

2950
03:45:37.72 --> 03:45:40.12
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2951
03:45:40.12 --> 03:45:41.04
For me, it's like this.

2952
03:45:41.04 --> 03:45:43.24
I like, I hate that you lose, bro.

2953
03:45:43.24 --> 03:45:44.64
I don't know if you can hear that about my mind.

2954
03:45:44.64 --> 03:45:45.64
I didn't do lose.

2955
03:45:45.64 --> 03:45:49.28
It bothers me so much, but I don't know.

2956
03:45:49.28 --> 03:45:51.52
I, yeah.

2957
03:45:51.52 --> 03:45:53.32
And that was like a close fight, right?

2958
03:45:53.32 --> 03:45:54.92
I got a shock array.

2959
03:45:54.92 --> 03:45:59.12
And what you didn't really like let it go or something?

2960
03:45:59.12 --> 03:46:00.12
That fight?

2961
03:46:00.12 --> 03:46:02.84
Yeah, I, I, I fought like a super conservative.

2962
03:46:02.84 --> 03:46:04.08
You know, I'm beating him on the ground.

2963
03:46:04.08 --> 03:46:06.88
I'm throwing him around, but I'm not taking any risks.

2964
03:46:06.88 --> 03:46:10.16
I'm not really pushing the pockets.

2965
03:46:10.16 --> 03:46:12.60
I was, I was apprehensive to go to the ground with him.

2966
03:46:12.60 --> 03:46:14.000
And until I finally went to the ground with him,

2967
03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:16.72
I picked him up, my threw him on the ground, passed his guard.

2968
03:46:16.72 --> 03:46:18.96
Yeah, I should have done the whole entire time.

2969
03:46:18.96 --> 03:46:21.80
My game plan was I thought he was going to try to take me down.

2970
03:46:21.80 --> 03:46:23.48
I'd be piecing him up on his feet,

2971
03:46:23.48 --> 03:46:26.24
because my wrestling was going to be better,

2972
03:46:26.24 --> 03:46:28.60
except that he didn't want to go to the ground.

2973
03:46:28.60 --> 03:46:31.92
He thought my wrestling and my judici was as good as his,

2974
03:46:31.92 --> 03:46:34.04
so he wanted to stand up and strike.

2975
03:46:34.04 --> 03:46:36.56
And it was three, four rounds into it when I was like,

2976
03:46:36.56 --> 03:46:40.92
oh, he's not trying to actually, what's going on here?

2977
03:46:40.92 --> 03:46:42.72
Maybe I should change my plan.

2978
03:46:42.72 --> 03:46:45.36
Ah, and that's when you realize you needed

2979
03:46:45.36 --> 03:46:48.84
a, to go to one of these professional games.

2980
03:46:48.84 --> 03:46:49.84
Yep.

2981
03:46:49.84 --> 03:46:54.28
And, and your, your decision was kind of between between

2982
03:46:54.28 --> 03:46:59.80
Jackson, went, went, went, went, went to John and AKA.

2983
03:46:59.80 --> 03:47:03.56
You end up going to Jackson, went, went, went John.

2984
03:47:03.56 --> 03:47:07.16
And do you talk about, so at this point you got Gsp

2985
03:47:07.16 --> 03:47:09.28
and Rashad Evans, they're both champs.

2986
03:47:09.28 --> 03:47:12.28
John Jones is on fire on the way up.

2987
03:47:12.28 --> 03:47:16.04
Carlos Condit, Cowboys Soroni, Nate Mark Court,

2988
03:47:16.04 --> 03:47:19.04
Holly Homes, Alister, O'Breme, Keith Jardie,

2989
03:47:19.04 --> 03:47:22.84
I mean this is like a freakin' killer crew.

2990
03:47:22.84 --> 03:47:24.24
Killer crew.

2991
03:47:24.24 --> 03:47:33.80
salty, the variety from the young hungry John Jones to the prestigious athletic

2992
03:47:33.80 --> 03:47:39.28
prowess of Rashad, to the international experience of Alistair Overem, to Holly

2993
03:47:39.28 --> 03:47:44.96
Holm who had, I think at this time maybe it doesn't boxing titles and then

2994
03:47:44.96 --> 03:47:49.44
Carlos Condit and Cowboys Seroni and Democio Page who had been winning titles in

2995
03:47:49.44 --> 03:47:52.68
different organizations all over the place. So when you walk in here you just see

2996
03:47:52.68 --> 03:47:59.68
like walls of belts, walls of belts, of world championships. So it's cool.

2997
03:47:59.68 --> 03:48:07.68
You talk about role in word John Jones for the first time or Tony word John

2998
03:48:07.68 --> 03:48:14.76
Jones. You said that was kind of next level scenario. Yeah, there was a, I'm

2999
03:48:14.76 --> 03:48:18.96
turning a Gordon Ryan these days and he's only person that I can kind of kind

3000
03:48:18.96 --> 03:48:25.72
of equate it to where we've been grappling for 30 years and like we got

3001
03:48:25.72 --> 03:48:30.64
tricks of Barce Leaves and I won't teach a trick. I will use a trick and they

3002
03:48:30.64 --> 03:48:36.04
will not like recognize it, absorb it and then apply it in the same in the same

3003
03:48:36.04 --> 03:48:42.24
flow of around. I've never, ever in my best moments ever learned or been able

3004
03:48:42.24 --> 03:48:50.24
to adapt that fast. John was so capable physically but intellectually and it's

3005
03:48:50.24 --> 03:48:54.96
weird that you put in like the cognitive elements of fighting but yeah he's a

3006
03:48:54.96 --> 03:48:59.76
savant. You know he could take something in real time and artistically steal

3007
03:48:59.76 --> 03:49:04.48
it and then put his own flare to it and then do it back to you in a heartbeat.

3008
03:49:04.48 --> 03:49:09.24
And that's who, that's, that's the John Jones that I meet when I get to Jackson's

3009
03:49:09.24 --> 03:49:13.64
you know it's the same Gordon Ryan that that humiliates me every day on the map

3010
03:49:13.64 --> 03:49:21.28
right now. The world is gonna have to wait for Gordon to decide he doesn't want to win

3011
03:49:21.28 --> 03:49:24.24
anymore. As far as I can tell right now.

3012
03:49:24.24 --> 03:49:26.92
You're, you're just a savage.

3013
03:49:26.92 --> 03:49:33.88
The, I can hang, I can go in there with the whole room, all the dudes and I can

3014
03:49:33.88 --> 03:49:40.04
you know like I'm forty, you know, forty three I can do fine. Not can embarrassed,

3015
03:49:40.04 --> 03:49:45.92
you know, lose some positions, you know, maybe occasionally get caught with Gordon.

3016
03:49:45.92 --> 03:49:50.76
I can't breathe unless he wants me to breathe. I can't score a position, a point, a

3017
03:49:50.76 --> 03:49:57.000
take down. He will give me an arm bar like this and dead derights. I have all

3018
03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:03.24
the win and then he just moves and gets out of it. He will never be beaten unless

3019
03:50:03.24 --> 03:50:08.24
he's bored. I want to do something else. Dean Lister, I had Dean Lister came in one day

3020
03:50:08.24 --> 03:50:13.24
and he's like, hey, arm lock me and I go, okay, so I put it on lock on him and he

3021
03:50:13.24 --> 03:50:18.24
gives me his straight arm. Not like clinched up like he gives me his straight arm

3022
03:50:18.24 --> 03:50:25.24
and he's like, okay, I'll say go. He, he says go and he gets out straight arm

3023
03:50:25.24 --> 03:50:29.24
lock bro. I mean, it is extended. I'm gonna all I have to do is move my hips whatever

3024
03:50:29.24 --> 03:50:34.84
three inches and he gets out and he does this five times in a row. And then he

3025
03:50:34.84 --> 03:50:38.24
says, okay, he goes, let me show you what I did and he goes, okay, now you're

3026
03:50:38.24 --> 03:50:41.24
trying to use him, but he's a bit of a five times in a row. Like I couldn't get out of

3027
03:50:41.24 --> 03:50:45.24
it. It's in and all. Another interesting story with this just happened. We were

3028
03:50:45.24 --> 03:50:50.24
doing a seminar or we were teaching like some basics off the fence. And he's

3029
03:50:50.24 --> 03:50:58.24
teaching a way to get out of a position was it. Oh, like someone's just

3030
03:50:58.24 --> 03:51:02.24
bare hugging. He's a basic self-defense. It's a bare hug, right? And there's a guy

3031
03:51:02.24 --> 03:51:06.24
in the crowd and he says, hey, with this hand, do this and with this other hand, do this

3032
03:51:06.24 --> 03:51:11.24
and you know, go. And then the guy raised his hand and he's like, yeah, what's your

3033
03:51:11.24 --> 03:51:15.24
question? And the guy says, hey, I only have one hand. What should I do? And

3034
03:51:15.24 --> 03:51:18.24
Dean, without missing a beat, he's like, oh, and you only have one hand. You

3035
03:51:18.24 --> 03:51:22.24
turn your shoulder a little bit more and come over like this. He had the answer

3036
03:51:22.24 --> 03:51:27.24
like completely on the tip of his tongue. So cool. For a one handed

3037
03:51:27.24 --> 03:51:35.24
grapple. Bro, I was like, this is crazy. Um, so yeah, that's where that's what I see like

3038
03:51:35.24 --> 03:51:40.24
Gordon's just going to be. There's people out there like that. A cornering for Roy

3039
03:51:40.24 --> 03:51:47.24
McDonald in a couple of days with John Danner. Roy is fighting for the PFL. The red

3040
03:51:47.24 --> 03:51:54.24
king. Like the Bayes now. Yeah, for sure. And Danner her is, uh, he's weird. He's brilliant.

3041
03:51:54.24 --> 03:52:02.24
But that room just like, at Jackson's in the peak, just like going into an ODA

3042
03:52:02.24 --> 03:52:07.24
when they're getting ready to go to war, there's like this, this palatable tension

3043
03:52:07.24 --> 03:52:13.24
of people starving to get better, like people starving for perfection. And it

3044
03:52:13.24 --> 03:52:18.24
is, it is the most contagious place to be. And I know you've been gravitating

3045
03:52:18.24 --> 03:52:23.24
in different, you know, entrepreneurially into different business adventures. Um,

3046
03:52:23.24 --> 03:52:29.24
like you want to be part of this like hunger of this, this star of this drive.

3047
03:52:29.24 --> 03:52:34.24
And it's almost, it's hard to describe what it is when you got it when you walk

3048
03:52:34.24 --> 03:52:38.24
into a room. That's where the Dan her team is like right now. You know, when you

3049
03:52:38.24 --> 03:52:43.24
got the Gary Tonans and you got the Gordon Orion's, you know, you got the Jean

3050
03:52:43.24 --> 03:52:48.24
Lowe Bdonnie's, you know, and you have just like the list goes on and on.

3051
03:52:48.24 --> 03:52:55.24
Is Gordon going to fight MMA? I don't sign to, oh, really. Yeah. Within one.

3052
03:52:55.24 --> 03:53:00.24
Yeah, in one. Did the dude hits hard. He physically is a freak. He could make

3053
03:53:00.24 --> 03:53:05.24
two or five if he wanted. He doesn't need to. Um, his wrestling is amazing.

3054
03:53:05.24 --> 03:53:10.24
His judo is amazing. Obviously his judo too is, um, perhaps the best ever.

3055
03:53:10.24 --> 03:53:14.24
Um, the, um, I don't know if he needs to.

3056
03:53:14.24 --> 03:53:21.24
Is he want to? Sometimes, you know, he sees, because I still train full MMA.

3057
03:53:21.24 --> 03:53:24.24
So I box a couple of days. I wrestle a couple of days. I do judo

3058
03:53:24.24 --> 03:53:28.24
a couple of days. Then I hit strength and conditioning, you know, five, five days a week.

3059
03:53:28.24 --> 03:53:33.24
So there's my, you know, nine to eleven workout sessions in a week.

3060
03:53:33.24 --> 03:53:40.24
And, um, but, you know, he's doing 14 math sessions a week. Like he'll have to give up.

3061
03:53:40.24 --> 03:53:46.24
Yeah. Ten or twelve of them to focus on MMA. Yeah. I don't know if you can do it.

3062
03:53:46.24 --> 03:53:51.24
I'm not sure I want to be. Yeah. I kind of wanted to be honest with you.

3063
03:53:51.24 --> 03:53:57.24
Because it just, I think it'd be cool to get that, get that kind of skill level in there.

3064
03:53:57.24 --> 03:54:04.24
And, and also, you never know, man, you never know? Like he, if I was him, I would want to know.

3065
03:54:04.24 --> 03:54:09.24
Like I would want to put it to the test. Let's go and see what happens.

3066
03:54:09.24 --> 03:54:10.24
Yeah.

3067
03:54:10.24 --> 03:54:11.24
Be right.

3068
03:54:11.24 --> 03:54:13.24
Gordon, I vote. I'm voting for you five minutes.

3069
03:54:13.24 --> 03:54:15.24
I'm right in checks that I don't have to cash.

3070
03:54:15.24 --> 03:54:18.24
You're with your ass. So sorry, they're voting.

3071
03:54:18.24 --> 03:54:23.24
Uh, so you're in there now. You got, you got, um, you start fighting.

3072
03:54:23.24 --> 03:54:31.24
You beat Melvin Manhoff, you beat Robbie Lawler, Lawler, which is, I mean, those are two freaking beast ranges.

3073
03:54:31.24 --> 03:54:33.24
My nose though. Uh, yeah.

3074
03:54:33.24 --> 03:54:37.24
That's Robbie right there. Was that, yeah, Robbie Lawler? Yeah. That's Robbie uppercut.

3075
03:54:37.24 --> 03:54:38.24
I hear.

3076
03:54:38.24 --> 03:54:39.24
Yeah. He's a beast.

3077
03:54:39.24 --> 03:54:40.24
Yeah.

3078
03:54:40.24 --> 03:54:42.24
I love him so much. He's a great human too.

3079
03:54:42.24 --> 03:54:42.24
Yeah.

3080
03:54:42.24 --> 03:54:48.52
Dude, he's just freaking awesome. He was a South Poth blasted with my head on center double leg as he threw a rear hand

3081
03:54:48.52 --> 03:54:54.52
up or cut and just like put me on the queer street, man. He's like, yeah, that's right.

3082
03:54:54.52 --> 03:54:59.52
Uh, meanwhile, the UFC buys strike force.

3083
03:54:59.52 --> 03:55:00.52
Oh, they did give me.

3084
03:55:00.52 --> 03:55:03.52
And with that, they get all the fighters and all the contracts.

3085
03:55:03.52 --> 03:55:03.52
Yeah.

3086
03:55:03.52 --> 03:55:05.52
And so boom, you end up in UFC.

3087
03:55:05.52 --> 03:55:11.52
And you kind of talk some smack about you about UFC.

3088
03:55:11.52 --> 03:55:17.52
You kind of talk some shit about UFC because UFC was bigger, but like more corporate, they were had more

3089
03:55:17.52 --> 03:55:21.52
control. They could get away with more with the fighters.

3090
03:55:21.52 --> 03:55:23.52
They didn't have to give as much.

3091
03:55:23.52 --> 03:55:27.52
And you didn't really particularly like that too much.

3092
03:55:27.52 --> 03:55:30.52
Um, so you talk shit a little bit.

3093
03:55:30.52 --> 03:55:31.52
Talk shit.

3094
03:55:31.52 --> 03:55:32.52
I said that.

3095
03:55:32.52 --> 03:55:33.52
Did you not?

3096
03:55:33.52 --> 03:55:34.52
I said.

3097
03:55:34.52 --> 03:55:34.52
Okay.

3098
03:55:34.52 --> 03:55:40.52
What I said, Jaco, is that a garbage man has a better career than a UFC fighter.

3099
03:55:40.52 --> 03:55:41.52
Okay.

3100
03:55:41.52 --> 03:55:42.52
Is that shit talking?

3101
03:55:42.52 --> 03:55:43.52
Carry you be the judge.

3102
03:55:43.52 --> 03:55:44.52
Yeah.

3103
03:55:44.52 --> 03:55:44.52
Yeah.

3104
03:55:44.52 --> 03:55:44.52
Okay.

3105
03:55:44.52 --> 03:55:45.52
Am I wrong?

3106
03:55:45.52 --> 03:55:46.52
No, you're not wrong.

3107
03:55:46.52 --> 03:55:47.52
But we're shit talking.

3108
03:55:47.52 --> 03:55:49.52
You know, we're talking union wages.

3109
03:55:49.52 --> 03:55:51.52
We're getting legitimate medical care.

3110
03:55:51.52 --> 03:55:51.52
Yeah.

3111
03:55:51.52 --> 03:55:53.52
You're going to only have to work shifts.

3112
03:55:53.52 --> 03:55:57.52
Um, you know, a manager is not taking 20% of my purse.

3113
03:55:57.52 --> 03:55:58.52
Right.

3114
03:55:58.52 --> 03:56:02.52
Think there's no way that a garbage man isn't making more money than 95% of the UFC roster.

3115
03:56:02.52 --> 03:56:03.52
There's no way.

3116
03:56:03.52 --> 03:56:04.52
And it's all facts.

3117
03:56:04.52 --> 03:56:05.52
It's all facts.

3118
03:56:05.52 --> 03:56:06.52
That's all facts.

3119
03:56:06.52 --> 03:56:08.52
And that's what pissed Dana off is because that wasn't wrong.

3120
03:56:08.52 --> 03:56:09.52
Yeah.

3121
03:56:09.52 --> 03:56:13.52
You know, if you weren't John Jones, if you weren't, you know, Connor hadn't hit the

3122
03:56:13.52 --> 03:56:15.52
scene yet.

3123
03:56:15.52 --> 03:56:18.52
Like, you're, if you're not the chocolate del, you're not making bank.

3124
03:56:18.52 --> 03:56:19.52
Yep.

3125
03:56:19.52 --> 03:56:20.52
Yep.

3126
03:56:20.52 --> 03:56:24.52
Um, Dana White non too happy about that.

3127
03:56:24.52 --> 03:56:25.52
He was mad.

3128
03:56:25.52 --> 03:56:26.52
Yeah.

3129
03:56:26.52 --> 03:56:30.52
And, and look, to Dana's side, you know, he's trying to grow this thing.

3130
03:56:30.52 --> 03:56:33.52
He's investing all this money to advertising and to do it.

3131
03:56:33.52 --> 03:56:34.52
Expansion all this stuff.

3132
03:56:34.52 --> 03:56:36.52
And like, he gets to the bottom of that list.

3133
03:56:36.52 --> 03:56:40.52
And if these fighters, you know, and they're just want to get in there.

3134
03:56:40.52 --> 03:56:44.52
So there's not much real demand signal for him to pay them all kinds of money.

3135
03:56:44.52 --> 03:56:45.52
And they're still not.

3136
03:56:45.52 --> 03:56:46.52
Yeah.

3137
03:56:46.52 --> 03:56:47.52
They're still getting the shaft.

3138
03:56:47.52 --> 03:56:48.52
Yeah.

3139
03:56:48.52 --> 03:56:54.52
Uh, but so Dana, I'm, I mean, I don't know if this is a direct result, but it kind of looks like it.

3140
03:56:54.52 --> 03:57:00.52
You get your first UFC first UFC first UFC fight and you get paired up against

3141
03:57:00.52 --> 03:57:01.52
Hodge your grace.

3142
03:57:01.52 --> 03:57:06.52
Stylistically, we're talking about the greatest grapple around the planet.

3143
03:57:06.52 --> 03:57:07.52
Yeah.

3144
03:57:07.52 --> 03:57:08.52
Yeah.

3145
03:57:08.52 --> 03:57:10.52
As my first fight.

3146
03:57:10.52 --> 03:57:11.52
Yeah.

3147
03:57:11.52 --> 03:57:18.52
And this seems like a good way to get rid of Tim Kennedy and get him out of this game.

3148
03:57:18.52 --> 03:57:20.52
If you don't want to leave him, like the money here cool.

3149
03:57:20.52 --> 03:57:22.52
We're not going to pay you because you're going to be gone.

3150
03:57:22.52 --> 03:57:23.52
How about this?

3151
03:57:23.52 --> 03:57:24.52
Well, we'll send you Roger Graysey.

3152
03:57:24.52 --> 03:57:25.52
Roger Graysey.

3153
03:57:25.52 --> 03:57:26.52
Yeah.

3154
03:57:26.52 --> 03:57:31.52
Uh, you kind of messed up Dana's plan on that one a little bit.

3155
03:57:31.52 --> 03:57:32.52
Yeah.

3156
03:57:32.52 --> 03:57:34.52
So before the fight, he takes all the fighters.

3157
03:57:34.52 --> 03:57:36.52
He kicks out all the coaches and he just burrates us.

3158
03:57:36.52 --> 03:57:39.52
He's like, listen, if you guys want to make more money, you go out there and make it.

3159
03:57:39.52 --> 03:57:40.52
I'm not going to name any name.

3160
03:57:40.52 --> 03:57:42.52
Tim Kennedy, but let me tell you what.

3161
03:57:42.52 --> 03:57:45.52
If you want to go out and make money, don't grab a wrestle fuck somebody.

3162
03:57:45.52 --> 03:57:46.52
I want you to go out there and knock him out.

3163
03:57:46.52 --> 03:57:49.52
You know, if you want to get the payday, go out there and put do the work.

3164
03:57:49.52 --> 03:57:52.52
This isn't front of all the fighters in the locker room.

3165
03:57:52.52 --> 03:57:54.52
Call in me out by name.

3166
03:57:54.52 --> 03:57:57.52
I'm just like, dude, dude, you know, Chris Lee bins in there.

3167
03:57:57.52 --> 03:57:58.52
Caunners in there.

3168
03:57:58.52 --> 03:58:01.52
I mean, those are his awkward.

3169
03:58:01.52 --> 03:58:05.52
And so he's like, so what I do, I go out there wrestle.

3170
03:58:05.52 --> 03:58:06.52
I go out there wrestle fuck.

3171
03:58:06.52 --> 03:58:08.52
Did living day lights at a hudger gracing.

3172
03:58:08.52 --> 03:58:10.52
Bro, that was a that wasn't saying.

3173
03:58:10.52 --> 03:58:12.52
That wasn't the same fight.

3174
03:58:12.52 --> 03:58:19.52
Yeah, hudger gracing is, I mean, just just going off the stats of his life.

3175
03:58:19.52 --> 03:58:22.52
He's absolutely one of the greatest grapplers of all time.

3176
03:58:22.52 --> 03:58:23.52
No.

3177
03:58:23.52 --> 03:58:25.52
Guy, nogie across the board.

3178
03:58:25.52 --> 03:58:27.52
He's just, he's just awesome.

3179
03:58:27.52 --> 03:58:31.52
And actually, he was on your back for what?

3180
03:58:31.52 --> 03:58:33.52
Two minutes, three minutes.

3181
03:58:33.52 --> 03:58:34.52
Yeah.

3182
03:58:34.52 --> 03:58:35.52
So I shoot a single.

3183
03:58:35.52 --> 03:58:36.52
He's six eight.

3184
03:58:36.52 --> 03:58:38.52
Which is bizarre anyways that you're shooting a signal.

3185
03:58:38.52 --> 03:58:39.52
Right.

3186
03:58:39.52 --> 03:58:40.52
That's free.

3187
03:58:40.52 --> 03:58:42.52
That you're shooting on him is kind of bizarre.

3188
03:58:42.52 --> 03:58:43.52
Was that your game plan?

3189
03:58:43.52 --> 03:58:44.52
Like, I can take this guy on the ground.

3190
03:58:44.52 --> 03:58:46.52
I wonder, put him to, I wonder, push him to the fence.

3191
03:58:46.52 --> 03:58:49.52
And I was using a leg attack to pressure him to the fence.

3192
03:58:49.52 --> 03:58:50.52
Okay.

3193
03:58:50.52 --> 03:58:53.52
And, uh, accept that he's long enough because he's essentially a giraffe.

3194
03:58:53.52 --> 03:58:54.52
Or he's he's six eight.

3195
03:58:54.52 --> 03:58:56.52
I think six six or six ten.

3196
03:58:56.52 --> 03:58:57.52
He's wildly tall.

3197
03:58:57.52 --> 03:58:58.52
Okay.

3198
03:58:58.52 --> 03:59:00.52
And he kicks a foot up and around.

3199
03:59:00.52 --> 03:59:03.52
As I'm on his single and gets a hook around my back.

3200
03:59:03.52 --> 03:59:05.52
While I'm on a sink, just get out of it.

3201
03:59:05.52 --> 03:59:06.52
This is the lane.

3202
03:59:06.52 --> 03:59:07.52
Then takes my back.

3203
03:59:07.52 --> 03:59:11.52
You do not want his best position is back.

3204
03:59:11.52 --> 03:59:12.52
Mm-hmm.

3205
03:59:12.52 --> 03:59:15.52
And so I've the best grappler in the world in his best position.

3206
03:59:15.52 --> 03:59:18.52
And we're 90 seconds in the round.

3207
03:59:18.52 --> 03:59:19.52
Dude.

3208
03:59:19.52 --> 03:59:23.52
It's a lot harder to put a rear naked joke on someone with gloves on.

3209
03:59:23.52 --> 03:59:24.52
It is.

3210
03:59:24.52 --> 03:59:26.52
It is a lot harder, right?

3211
03:59:26.52 --> 03:59:27.52
Yep.

3212
03:59:27.52 --> 03:59:29.52
And it's a lot harder when somebody can punch you.

3213
03:59:29.52 --> 03:59:30.52
Yeah.

3214
03:59:30.52 --> 03:59:33.52
You survive that and then he's tired.

3215
03:59:33.52 --> 03:59:34.52
Yep.

3216
03:59:34.52 --> 03:59:36.52
People are all out there.

3217
03:59:36.52 --> 03:59:37.52
It is a weird energy system.

3218
03:59:37.52 --> 03:59:39.52
When you like you do this, I submit your cold.

3219
03:59:39.52 --> 03:59:41.52
And every choke has a different squeeze.

3220
03:59:41.52 --> 03:59:43.52
And you're like, my guillotine has a different squeeze than my,

3221
03:59:43.52 --> 03:59:44.52
than my rear naked choke.

3222
03:59:44.52 --> 03:59:46.52
My head, no, I'm choke has a different squeeze than my liched

3223
03:59:46.52 --> 03:59:47.52
a podry.

3224
03:59:47.52 --> 03:59:51.52
You know, and he definitely like get hit the gas.

3225
03:59:51.52 --> 03:59:54.52
You know, just dumped everything in that rear naked choke.

3226
03:59:54.52 --> 03:59:57.52
And when he started getting punched and I pulled his hands away.

3227
03:59:57.52 --> 03:59:59.52
And I did that basket back to scape.

3228
03:59:59.52 --> 04:00:01.52
You could just feel his adrenaline dump.

3229
04:00:01.52 --> 04:00:02.52
It's just,

3230
04:00:02.52 --> 04:00:03.52
Wow.

3231
04:00:03.52 --> 04:00:04.52
Taked.

3232
04:00:04.52 --> 04:00:08.52
There's something all the psychological impact of you have a great position.

3233
04:00:08.52 --> 04:00:10.52
You should finish this fight right now.

3234
04:00:10.52 --> 04:00:11.52
Oh, you can taste it.

3235
04:00:11.52 --> 04:00:12.52
I mean, let's face it.

3236
04:00:12.52 --> 04:00:15.52
You know, he gets your back and he's like, oh, this is over.

3237
04:00:15.52 --> 04:00:16.52
Yep.

3238
04:00:16.52 --> 04:00:18.52
And then all of a sudden he's admitted into he's like, okay, it's not quite as over,

3239
04:00:18.52 --> 04:00:19.52
but I'm still going to finish it.

3240
04:00:19.52 --> 04:00:20.52
Oh, it's not over yet.

3241
04:00:20.52 --> 04:00:21.52
Three minutes here.

3242
04:00:21.52 --> 04:00:23.52
You know what I'm going to squeeze as hard as I can and get this thing finished?

3243
04:00:23.52 --> 04:00:24.52
I can taste it.

3244
04:00:24.52 --> 04:00:25.52
Yes.

3245
04:00:25.52 --> 04:00:26.52
I didn't have to worry about this.

3246
04:00:26.52 --> 04:00:27.52
Who this guy, who's this Tim can?

3247
04:00:27.52 --> 04:00:28.52
I'm not worried about that anymore.

3248
04:00:28.52 --> 04:00:30.52
Cause now I get to go and celebrate this big victory.

3249
04:00:30.52 --> 04:00:32.52
And he just got out.

3250
04:00:32.52 --> 04:00:33.52
Yep.

3251
04:00:33.52 --> 04:00:36.52
And I got all these rounds and I just gave up the best position I have.

3252
04:00:36.52 --> 04:00:38.52
That hurts.

3253
04:00:38.52 --> 04:00:39.52
Hmm.

3254
04:00:39.52 --> 04:00:41.52
And I experienced that myself.

3255
04:00:41.52 --> 04:00:43.52
You know, the you won't remerow fight a while later.

3256
04:00:43.52 --> 04:00:44.52
Yeah, that's right.

3257
04:00:44.52 --> 04:00:47.52
You know, it's, it's hard when you have everything.

3258
04:00:47.52 --> 04:00:48.52
And then the moment,

3259
04:00:48.52 --> 04:00:49.52
just goes,

3260
04:00:49.52 --> 04:00:50.52
When.

3261
04:00:50.52 --> 04:00:51.52
You know, happens in war too.

3262
04:00:51.52 --> 04:00:52.52
Like it feels,

3263
04:00:52.52 --> 04:00:54.52
everything's going going right.

3264
04:00:54.52 --> 04:00:55.52
You know, you just smash it.

3265
04:00:55.52 --> 04:00:56.52
Then all of a sudden,

3266
04:00:56.52 --> 04:00:58.52
you know,

3267
04:00:58.52 --> 04:00:59.52
you know,

3268
04:00:59.52 --> 04:01:00.52
you know,

3269
04:01:00.52 --> 04:01:01.52
you know,

3270
04:01:01.52 --> 04:01:04.52
but you end up just just,

3271
04:01:04.52 --> 04:01:06.52
to actually dominating him,

3272
04:01:06.52 --> 04:01:08.52
all respect to a hauser gracy,

3273
04:01:08.52 --> 04:01:10.52
but you freaking,

3274
04:01:10.52 --> 04:01:10.52
to,

3275
04:01:10.52 --> 04:01:12.52
we're taking him down.

3276
04:01:12.52 --> 04:01:13.52
You know,

3277
04:01:13.52 --> 04:01:13.52
and,

3278
04:01:13.52 --> 04:01:16.52
and I take him down more times in that fight than,

3279
04:01:16.52 --> 04:01:17.52
his entire career,

3280
04:01:17.52 --> 04:01:18.52
cumatively.

3281
04:01:18.52 --> 04:01:20.52
And I land more punches on him in that one fight.

3282
04:01:20.52 --> 04:01:22.52
Then it is an entire career,

3283
04:01:22.52 --> 04:01:23.52
cumatively.

3284
04:01:23.52 --> 04:01:23.52
Yeah.

3285
04:01:23.52 --> 04:01:25.52
It was a freaking impressive.

3286
04:01:25.52 --> 04:01:27.52
Damn display.

3287
04:01:27.52 --> 04:01:28.52
And, you know,

3288
04:01:28.52 --> 04:01:29.52
what, you know,

3289
04:01:29.52 --> 04:01:30.52
all of these times where I was like,

3290
04:01:30.52 --> 04:01:31.52
and then you lose,

3291
04:01:31.52 --> 04:01:32.52
and I'm all sad.

3292
04:01:32.52 --> 04:01:33.52
I was freaking like,

3293
04:01:33.52 --> 04:01:34.52
damn,

3294
04:01:34.52 --> 04:01:36.52
finally he pulls one out.

3295
04:01:36.52 --> 04:01:37.52
That's what's up, man.

3296
04:01:37.52 --> 04:01:39.52
Maricopa, baby.

3297
04:01:39.52 --> 04:01:41.52
So that was awesome.

3298
04:01:41.52 --> 04:01:42.52
You,

3299
04:01:42.52 --> 04:01:46.52
then you have fight for the troops in Fort Campbell,

3300
04:01:46.52 --> 04:01:47.52
Kentucky,

3301
04:01:47.52 --> 04:01:49.52
where the hunting first airborne division is,

3302
04:01:49.52 --> 04:01:50.52
fight against,

3303
04:01:50.52 --> 04:01:50.52
Huffield,

3304
04:01:50.52 --> 04:01:51.52
and the tall.

3305
04:01:51.52 --> 04:01:52.52
Stud.

3306
04:01:52.52 --> 04:01:53.52
Love that guy.

3307
04:01:53.52 --> 04:01:54.52
You get a KO in the first round.

3308
04:01:54.52 --> 04:01:57.52
A crown goes for you can insane.

3309
04:01:57.52 --> 04:01:59.52
Because you're,

3310
04:01:59.52 --> 04:02:00.52
you,

3311
04:02:00.52 --> 04:02:01.52
and the crown is the crown.

3312
04:02:01.52 --> 04:02:02.52
The crown is the one.

3313
04:02:02.52 --> 04:02:03.52
It's just like,

3314
04:02:03.52 --> 04:02:04.52
fifth group is there.

3315
04:02:04.52 --> 04:02:05.52
Six handers.

3316
04:02:05.52 --> 04:02:07.52
A hundred firsts is there.

3317
04:02:07.52 --> 04:02:08.52
I mean, I had to pull it with everything.

3318
04:02:08.52 --> 04:02:10.52
One of these guys went to cue course with a whole bunch of them.

3319
04:02:10.52 --> 04:02:13.52
One of the dudes has them walking out to the octagon.

3320
04:02:13.52 --> 04:02:14.52
He leans forward.

3321
04:02:14.52 --> 04:02:15.52
And he's,

3322
04:02:15.52 --> 04:02:17.52
he's like trying to grab me as I'm walking to the cage.

3323
04:02:17.52 --> 04:02:18.52
The last time I saw his face,

3324
04:02:18.52 --> 04:02:19.52
when I was,

3325
04:02:19.52 --> 04:02:23.52
when I was handing one of my studs to him after getting blown up.

3326
04:02:23.52 --> 04:02:25.52
The last time I saw that face,

3327
04:02:25.52 --> 04:02:26.52
face to face,

3328
04:02:26.52 --> 04:02:28.52
was when I was giving him one of my dudes.

3329
04:02:28.52 --> 04:02:30.52
Boom,

3330
04:02:30.52 --> 04:02:31.52
it's just like,

3331
04:02:31.52 --> 04:02:32.52
this is wild.

3332
04:02:32.52 --> 04:02:34.52
That's the emotion walking out to the cage.

3333
04:02:34.52 --> 04:02:37.52
Every military fighter that had fought that night had lost.

3334
04:02:37.52 --> 04:02:40.52
And then I'm the final man that's all on me.

3335
04:02:40.52 --> 04:02:41.52
Main event fight.

3336
04:02:41.52 --> 04:02:44.52
Every military guy has fought and lost.

3337
04:02:44.52 --> 04:02:45.52
And,

3338
04:02:45.52 --> 04:02:47.52
you know,

3339
04:02:47.52 --> 04:02:49.52
hype.

3340
04:02:49.52 --> 04:02:50.52
You know,

3341
04:02:50.52 --> 04:02:52.52
a lot of emotion in there.

3342
04:02:52.52 --> 04:02:55.52
And next up is Bizby.

3343
04:02:55.52 --> 04:02:57.52
Doosh bag.

3344
04:02:57.52 --> 04:03:01.52
You guys had some bad blood.

3345
04:03:01.52 --> 04:03:04.52
And this goes on for years.

3346
04:03:04.52 --> 04:03:06.52
Like it's years worth of bad blood.

3347
04:03:06.52 --> 04:03:06.52
Yeah,

3348
04:03:06.52 --> 04:03:07.52
he fought one of my buddies.

3349
04:03:07.52 --> 04:03:09.52
Jorge Rivera cheated in the fight.

3350
04:03:09.52 --> 04:03:10.52
Bragged about it.

3351
04:03:10.52 --> 04:03:13.52
He spit on one of my friends during the fight.

3352
04:03:13.52 --> 04:03:15.52
Literally like spad on him.

3353
04:03:15.52 --> 04:03:19.52
And then set a whole bunch of delicious things about Jorge's family.

3354
04:03:19.52 --> 04:03:22.52
And just bad human things.

3355
04:03:22.52 --> 04:03:24.52
And so from that moment I had a target on him.

3356
04:03:24.52 --> 04:03:25.52
You know,

3357
04:03:25.52 --> 04:03:26.52
it's like I want this guy.

3358
04:03:26.52 --> 04:03:27.52
You know,

3359
04:03:27.52 --> 04:03:29.52
you don't disrespect my friends like that.

3360
04:03:29.52 --> 04:03:30.52
You don't spit on.

3361
04:03:30.52 --> 04:03:31.52
Have you ever spit on somebody?

3362
04:03:31.52 --> 04:03:32.52
No.

3363
04:03:32.52 --> 04:03:32.52
Have you ever?

3364
04:03:32.52 --> 04:03:33.52
No.

3365
04:03:33.52 --> 04:03:33.52
No.

3366
04:03:33.52 --> 04:03:34.52
Right?

3367
04:03:34.52 --> 04:03:35.52
Like who does that?

3368
04:03:35.52 --> 04:03:37.52
I'm mom quickly like reviewing my life.

3369
04:03:37.52 --> 04:03:39.52
I just gave you an honest answer.

3370
04:03:39.52 --> 04:03:41.52
There was one incident.

3371
04:03:41.52 --> 04:03:44.52
I got spit on and that didn't turn out well.

3372
04:03:44.52 --> 04:03:47.52
That resulted in a bad night.

3373
04:03:47.52 --> 04:03:48.52
Yeah.

3374
04:03:48.52 --> 04:03:49.52
Yeah.

3375
04:03:49.52 --> 04:03:50.52
Yeah.

3376
04:03:50.52 --> 04:03:51.52
Was that when you were a balancer or something?

3377
04:03:51.52 --> 04:03:52.52
No.

3378
04:03:52.52 --> 04:03:54.52
That was back when I was in the Marine Corps.

3379
04:03:54.52 --> 04:03:55.52
Oh, really?

3380
04:03:55.52 --> 04:03:56.52
Yeah.

3381
04:03:56.52 --> 04:03:57.52
That was an issue.

3382
04:03:57.52 --> 04:03:58.52
What happened?

3383
04:03:58.52 --> 04:04:02.52
So Greenville, North Carolina,

3384
04:04:02.52 --> 04:04:04.52
Party Town, ECU.

3385
04:04:04.52 --> 04:04:05.52
Yeah.

3386
04:04:05.52 --> 04:04:06.52
And we were,

3387
04:04:06.52 --> 04:04:07.52
it was after a night out.

3388
04:04:07.52 --> 04:04:10.52
We were all hammered in my buddy's apartment.

3389
04:04:10.52 --> 04:04:12.52
Fight breaks out in the hallway.

3390
04:04:12.52 --> 04:04:14.52
And me and my buddy go out there to see what's happening.

3391
04:04:14.52 --> 04:04:15.52
It's a,

3392
04:04:15.52 --> 04:04:19.52
It's a friend's of ours and a fight goes down.

3393
04:04:19.52 --> 04:04:22.52
Long story short.

3394
04:04:22.52 --> 04:04:23.52
Everybody's dispersing.

3395
04:04:23.52 --> 04:04:24.52
We're breaking it up.

3396
04:04:24.52 --> 04:04:27.52
And I'm trying to help break up this fight.

3397
04:04:27.52 --> 04:04:29.52
And I'm holding the guy back.

3398
04:04:29.52 --> 04:04:31.52
And I'm like, look man, calm down.

3399
04:04:31.52 --> 04:04:33.52
He's like, like fuck you.

3400
04:04:33.52 --> 04:04:36.52
And like spit some of my face.

3401
04:04:36.52 --> 04:04:38.52
So double that ground of bound.

3402
04:04:38.52 --> 04:04:42.52
We're standing in front of a stairwell.

3403
04:04:42.52 --> 04:04:47.52
This guy gets sport-appuished essentially down the stairwell.

3404
04:04:47.52 --> 04:04:48.52
Oh, damn.

3405
04:04:48.52 --> 04:04:49.52
Yeah.

3406
04:04:49.52 --> 04:04:50.52
And it was bad idea.

3407
04:04:50.52 --> 04:04:53.52
Do not push people when you're around stairs.

3408
04:04:53.52 --> 04:04:54.52
It's a bad idea.

3409
04:04:54.52 --> 04:04:56.52
This guy breaks his arm.

3410
04:04:56.52 --> 04:04:57.52
Yeah.

3411
04:04:57.52 --> 04:04:58.52
Turned into a whole thing.

3412
04:04:58.52 --> 04:05:00.52
You got reported, you know, to my command.

3413
04:05:00.52 --> 04:05:02.52
It was just bad business.

3414
04:05:02.52 --> 04:05:03.52
Don't do that.

3415
04:05:03.52 --> 04:05:04.52
Or don't spit on somebody.

3416
04:05:04.52 --> 04:05:05.52
And don't spit on people.

3417
04:05:05.52 --> 04:05:07.52
Let's throw it down the stairs.

3418
04:05:07.52 --> 04:05:10.52
So as I reviewed my life over here on my end,

3419
04:05:10.52 --> 04:05:13.52
I have to confess.

3420
04:05:13.52 --> 04:05:15.52
This is going back way back.

3421
04:05:15.52 --> 04:05:16.52
I probably...

3422
04:05:16.52 --> 04:05:18.52
12 years old.

3423
04:05:18.52 --> 04:05:19.52
Hmm.

3424
04:05:19.52 --> 04:05:21.52
And there was friends of the family.

3425
04:05:21.52 --> 04:05:23.52
They're staying at my house.

3426
04:05:23.52 --> 04:05:25.52
The kids, the parents went somewhere.

3427
04:05:25.52 --> 04:05:27.52
And the kids stayed at our house.

3428
04:05:27.52 --> 04:05:30.52
And like these are like our, you know, friends of the family scenario.

3429
04:05:30.52 --> 04:05:33.52
And the kid, the son, is the daughter's my age.

3430
04:05:33.52 --> 04:05:37.52
The son is maybe two years younger than me.

3431
04:05:37.52 --> 04:05:42.52
And he, like, will play in a round kind of he spit on me.

3432
04:05:42.52 --> 04:05:43.52
Right?

3433
04:05:43.52 --> 04:05:48.52
And I was like, oh, so I, I used to chase them.

3434
04:05:48.52 --> 04:05:50.52
And eventually I caught them.

3435
04:05:50.52 --> 04:05:54.52
And I, I had the, for whatever five minutes of chasing them around,

3436
04:05:54.52 --> 04:05:56.52
I was saving spit in my mouth.

3437
04:05:56.52 --> 04:05:59.52
And I pinned him down.

3438
04:05:59.52 --> 04:06:02.52
Before we knew what the mount was, I got the mount on him.

3439
04:06:02.52 --> 04:06:05.52
Helled his hands down by the wrists.

3440
04:06:05.52 --> 04:06:07.52
And I didn't spit on him.

3441
04:06:07.52 --> 04:06:10.52
I drew on him for about 30 seconds.

3442
04:06:10.52 --> 04:06:15.52
And as I was doing it, he was shaking his head.

3443
04:06:15.52 --> 04:06:19.52
Like, no, no, no, he was just going all over his face, bro.

3444
04:06:19.52 --> 04:06:21.52
Sorry about that Tommy.

3445
04:06:21.52 --> 04:06:23.52
I did, you know, all, all in good fun.

3446
04:06:23.52 --> 04:06:25.52
But I think you, you, you do first blood, bro.

3447
04:06:25.52 --> 04:06:27.52
So that's what you get.

3448
04:06:27.52 --> 04:06:28.52
Yeah.

3449
04:06:28.52 --> 04:06:30.52
Michael's bizzbbing through first blood.

3450
04:06:30.52 --> 04:06:31.52
And I drew last blood.

3451
04:06:31.52 --> 04:06:32.52
That was it.

3452
04:06:32.52 --> 04:06:36.52
What I liked, my favorite part about reading about that fight was when you,

3453
04:06:36.52 --> 04:06:39.52
you have a good first round.

3454
04:06:39.52 --> 04:06:42.52
You have like an okay second round.

3455
04:06:42.52 --> 04:06:47.52
And Greg Jackson gets you in the corner in Eagles specialist Kennedy.

3456
04:06:47.52 --> 04:06:49.52
Why do you want him back in this fight?

3457
04:06:49.52 --> 04:06:52.52
I was like, that is so freaking brilliant.

3458
04:06:52.52 --> 04:06:54.52
I took him into deep waters.

3459
04:06:54.52 --> 04:06:56.52
Like, there could be, quote, take him to the deepest waters.

3460
04:06:56.52 --> 04:06:57.52
The ocean drowned there.

3461
04:06:57.52 --> 04:06:59.52
First round, take him down there.

3462
04:06:59.52 --> 04:07:01.52
And then second round, I just started like, plain.

3463
04:07:01.52 --> 04:07:07.52
And, um, and Jackson was like, why do you want specialist Kennedy?

3464
04:07:07.52 --> 04:07:10.52
Why do you want him back in this fight?

3465
04:07:10.52 --> 04:07:13.52
You know, take him back into the deep waters and drown it there.

3466
04:07:13.52 --> 04:07:15.52
It was like, Roger.

3467
04:07:15.52 --> 04:07:18.52
You know, you know, it's, you know, it's, Greg.

3468
04:07:18.52 --> 04:07:19.52
He is brilliant.

3469
04:07:19.52 --> 04:07:20.52
He really is a brilliant guy.

3470
04:07:20.52 --> 04:07:21.52
You know, it's how to get to his fighters.

3471
04:07:21.52 --> 04:07:22.52
And man, he got to me.

3472
04:07:22.52 --> 04:07:24.52
And then that third round came in.

3473
04:07:24.52 --> 04:07:27.52
It was a different thing for the next few rounds.

3474
04:07:27.52 --> 04:07:30.52
I was sitting at my office a trade at one day and I get a call.

3475
04:07:30.52 --> 04:07:35.52
And they're like, hey, Jockel, there's some guy named Greg Jackson from the UFC.

3476
04:07:35.52 --> 04:07:36.52
That's getting a tour today.

3477
04:07:36.52 --> 04:07:37.52
Do you want to give it to him?

3478
04:07:37.52 --> 04:07:38.52
And I was like, what's his name?

3479
04:07:38.52 --> 04:07:40.52
And Greg Jackson, I go, how, how, yeah.

3480
04:07:40.52 --> 04:07:41.52
Yes, I do.

3481
04:07:41.52 --> 04:07:43.52
And that's why I ended up linking up him.

3482
04:07:43.52 --> 04:07:46.52
But we back in the day, we used to rest.

3483
04:07:46.52 --> 04:07:48.52
We used to compete against all those guys.

3484
04:07:48.52 --> 04:07:52.52
They'd come out here and enter all these grappling tournaments.

3485
04:07:52.52 --> 04:07:55.52
And we'd, we'd be competing against them.

3486
04:07:55.52 --> 04:07:59.52
Remember, I, I've had a match against Keith Thirty.

3487
04:07:59.52 --> 04:08:04.52
And I lost, yeah, I lost.

3488
04:08:04.52 --> 04:08:06.52
But Dean, he had to go against Dean.

3489
04:08:06.52 --> 04:08:09.52
And I was like, hey, Dean, I go, he's okay.

3490
04:08:09.52 --> 04:08:11.52
So what's the guy like, and I go, I go, he's strong.

3491
04:08:11.52 --> 04:08:12.52
You know, he's good-grabble.

3492
04:08:12.52 --> 04:08:14.52
I go, but he's wrestling's not very good.

3493
04:08:14.52 --> 04:08:15.52
And he goes, okay, cool.

3494
04:08:15.52 --> 04:08:17.52
And Dean goes out and gets taken down.

3495
04:08:17.52 --> 04:08:20.52
Like, he's like, he's like, to, to, to, to, because he was like,

3496
04:08:20.52 --> 04:08:23.52
So I like relaxed Dean too much on the take down.

3497
04:08:23.52 --> 04:08:25.52
And so, me and Keith Thirty and took Dean down.

3498
04:08:25.52 --> 04:08:28.52
And then I think Dean got a knee lock on him.

3499
04:08:28.52 --> 04:08:31.52
And he's hard to finish.

3500
04:08:31.52 --> 04:08:33.52
Dude, Keith, Dean got a knee lock on him.

3501
04:08:33.52 --> 04:08:35.52
And Dean, he did not tap.

3502
04:08:35.52 --> 04:08:38.52
And I've been in a thousand of Dean's knee locks.

3503
04:08:38.52 --> 04:08:41.52
And I've tapped to 990, seven of them.

3504
04:08:41.52 --> 04:08:43.52
And Keith Thirty and was just like, whatever.

3505
04:08:43.52 --> 04:08:45.52
And Dean beat him on points, but damn.

3506
04:08:45.52 --> 04:08:47.52
I was like, hey, dude, this dude ain't tapin' for,

3507
04:08:47.52 --> 04:08:50.52
I would see him in the USA, because he got his laptop and dealt anything.

3508
04:08:50.52 --> 04:08:52.52
Ever in the USA ever.

3509
04:08:52.52 --> 04:08:57.52
When I was, I was getting ready, big fight on peak.

3510
04:08:57.52 --> 04:08:59.52
Fight camp type shape.

3511
04:08:59.52 --> 04:09:02.52
And Keith comes in to be a body for me.

3512
04:09:02.52 --> 04:09:06.52
And he's, he's not, he's not in fight shape.

3513
04:09:06.52 --> 04:09:11.52
I think he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's, he's literally just like dropping into the gym to be a good friend, be a good teammate.

3514
04:09:11.52 --> 04:09:15.52
And, um, I do around with him, and it's competitive.

3515
04:09:15.52 --> 04:09:18.52
I do the second round with him, and he starts beating me.

3516
04:09:18.52 --> 04:09:21.52
I do a third round with him, and he mobs the floor with me.

3517
04:09:21.52 --> 04:09:24.52
And, um, he just out conditions me.

3518
04:09:24.52 --> 04:09:25.52
Out works me.

3519
04:09:25.52 --> 04:09:27.52
It hits the take down, it gets to positions.

3520
04:09:27.52 --> 04:09:30.52
I'm scrambling to get away, I'm fighting to get back up.

3521
04:09:30.52 --> 04:09:32.52
I'm just losing everything everywhere.

3522
04:09:32.52 --> 04:09:35.52
And there's a photo of me on my knees at Jackson's.

3523
04:09:35.52 --> 04:09:40.52
And I'm just sitting there, and you can see, and blurry out of the,

3524
04:09:40.52 --> 04:09:44.52
in the background is Keith, heading the back.

3525
04:09:44.52 --> 04:09:47.52
He just got done murdering me for 15 minutes.

3526
04:09:47.52 --> 04:09:52.52
And then he goes over and he's sitting there, and I'm just sitting there like, what just happened?

3527
04:09:52.52 --> 04:09:56.52
I'm in fight shape, I'm ready to go, I'm two weeks out, you know, I'm starting to peek,

3528
04:09:56.52 --> 04:09:57.52
and he just comes in.

3529
04:09:57.52 --> 04:09:59.52
I mean, Keith is, he's a freak.

3530
04:09:59.52 --> 04:10:01.52
And he's a great person.

3531
04:10:01.52 --> 04:10:03.52
Oh, yeah, super nice guy.

3532
04:10:03.52 --> 04:10:06.52
But when he beat Chuck Adel, how do you beat Chuck Adel?

3533
04:10:06.52 --> 04:10:08.52
He out pointed him in strikes.

3534
04:10:08.52 --> 04:10:09.52
Damn bro.

3535
04:10:09.52 --> 04:10:10.52
That's great.

3536
04:10:10.52 --> 04:10:11.52
He beat Chuck too.

3537
04:10:11.52 --> 04:10:13.52
What?

3538
04:10:13.52 --> 04:10:17.52
He's just one of those guys that went, maybe he showed up.

3539
04:10:17.52 --> 04:10:18.52
Yeah.

3540
04:10:18.52 --> 04:10:20.52
Has he been in movies now and stuff?

3541
04:10:20.52 --> 04:10:21.52
Yeah, he's, he's, he's a great guy.

3542
04:10:21.52 --> 04:10:23.52
He's, he's a great actor.

3543
04:10:23.52 --> 04:10:25.52
He's like the, the Everfield.

3544
04:10:25.52 --> 04:10:26.52
He's so awesome.

3545
04:10:26.52 --> 04:10:27.52
He's a great actor.

3546
04:10:27.52 --> 04:10:27.52
Of course.

3547
04:10:27.52 --> 04:10:30.52
Dude, a typecast that guy all day is like the Venus guy in the bar.

3548
04:10:30.52 --> 04:10:31.52
Good stunt man too.

3549
04:10:31.52 --> 04:10:32.52
Yeah.

3550
04:10:32.52 --> 04:10:36.52
When I'm, when I'm made that movie, range 15, he came out and helped us.

3551
04:10:36.52 --> 04:10:38.52
Do, he and Greg came out.

3552
04:10:38.52 --> 04:10:43.52
We lost our stunt coordinator and Keith and Greg came out and helped me save the day.

3553
04:10:43.52 --> 04:10:46.52
So good friend of love you Keith.

3554
04:10:46.52 --> 04:10:53.52
You were mentioning, you well, Romero September 27, 2014.

3555
04:10:53.52 --> 04:11:00.52
This is, you want to, this seriously won't be out bro.

3556
04:11:00.52 --> 04:11:01.52
Amitya.

3557
04:11:01.52 --> 04:11:04.52
So, buvr nice.

3558
04:11:04.52 --> 04:11:05.52
Good word.

3559
04:11:05.52 --> 04:11:08.52
So this, so you're, so now you're at a point.

3560
04:11:08.52 --> 04:11:09.52
You've been winning.

3561
04:11:09.52 --> 04:11:10.52
You've been winning.

3562
04:11:10.52 --> 04:11:11.52
You be busy.

3563
04:11:11.52 --> 04:11:12.52
You beat these.

3564
04:11:12.52 --> 04:11:14.52
All these other guys all the man off.

3565
04:11:14.52 --> 04:11:19.52
But, you're, you're, you're on our streak.

3566
04:11:19.52 --> 04:11:21.52
And so now it's starting to look like title shot.

3567
04:11:21.52 --> 04:11:22.52
Yeah.

3568
04:11:22.52 --> 04:11:23.52
Bixbings champion.

3569
04:11:23.52 --> 04:11:26.52
It just beat, look rock hold.

3570
04:11:26.52 --> 04:11:27.52
Oh, that's right.

3571
04:11:27.52 --> 04:11:28.52
That's right.

3572
04:11:28.52 --> 04:11:29.52
Shopping left hook.

3573
04:11:29.52 --> 04:11:30.52
Yep.

3574
04:11:30.52 --> 04:11:32.52
On the, on the two-week notice.

3575
04:11:32.52 --> 04:11:33.52
Good for Bixbings, good on him.

3576
04:11:33.52 --> 04:11:34.52
Yeah.

3577
04:11:34.52 --> 04:11:37.52
So now Bixbings the champion.

3578
04:11:37.52 --> 04:11:39.52
So now you're like triple hungry.

3579
04:11:39.52 --> 04:11:40.52
Yeah.

3580
04:11:40.52 --> 04:11:42.52
You're like that's chopping the day.

3581
04:11:42.52 --> 04:11:47.52
And you got YOL Romero, who is a, a Cuban dude.

3582
04:11:47.52 --> 04:11:50.52
He's a silver medal wrestler.

3583
04:11:50.52 --> 04:11:56.52
If you don't know who he is, just picture superhero human looking body.

3584
04:11:56.52 --> 04:11:59.52
I mean, he looks like a freaking mutant.

3585
04:11:59.52 --> 04:12:02.52
Uh, and this is a hell of a fight.

3586
04:12:02.52 --> 04:12:03.52
And he's on a streak too.

3587
04:12:03.52 --> 04:12:06.52
He's destroying people on his side.

3588
04:12:06.52 --> 04:12:07.52
I'm three.

3589
04:12:07.52 --> 04:12:08.52
He's two in the world.

3590
04:12:08.52 --> 04:12:12.52
First round, it's a close round.

3591
04:12:12.52 --> 04:12:14.52
It's a close round.

3592
04:12:14.52 --> 04:12:16.52
It's a close round.

3593
04:12:16.52 --> 04:12:17.52
Yeah.

3594
04:12:17.52 --> 04:12:19.52
I don't know if back and forth made you stick down.

3595
04:12:19.52 --> 04:12:21.52
Maybe if I was a judge, I'm judging.

3596
04:12:21.52 --> 04:12:22.52
I'm giving him the first round.

3597
04:12:22.52 --> 04:12:23.52
I don't know.

3598
04:12:23.52 --> 04:12:24.52
Is that right?

3599
04:12:24.52 --> 04:12:25.52
Is that accurate?

3600
04:12:25.52 --> 04:12:26.52
You think it's super close.

3601
04:12:26.52 --> 04:12:28.52
It's close.

3602
04:12:28.52 --> 04:12:30.52
Second round.

3603
04:12:30.52 --> 04:12:32.52
Uh.

3604
04:12:32.52 --> 04:12:34.52
You catch it.

3605
04:12:34.52 --> 04:12:37.52
And you catch him with like the mayhem combos.

3606
04:12:37.52 --> 04:12:42.52
And you have him rocked beyond rocked.

3607
04:12:42.52 --> 04:12:44.52
And it's, it's about to be over.

3608
04:12:44.52 --> 04:12:45.52
Like you got the screwed.

3609
04:12:45.52 --> 04:12:47.52
It's done.

3610
04:12:47.52 --> 04:12:49.52
Um, then the bell goes.

3611
04:12:49.52 --> 04:12:54.52
So he's, he's saved by the bell which, unfortunately, in MMA, that's a thing.

3612
04:12:54.52 --> 04:12:57.52
And if you, if the bell goes, it's over.

3613
04:12:57.52 --> 04:12:58.52
Yep.

3614
04:12:58.52 --> 04:13:00.52
That round is over.

3615
04:13:00.52 --> 04:13:02.52
Um, but you got him.

3616
04:13:02.52 --> 04:13:04.52
Man, like dead derights.

3617
04:13:04.52 --> 04:13:05.52
This guy's down.

3618
04:13:05.52 --> 04:13:09.52
You're definitely going to get him in the next round.

3619
04:13:09.52 --> 04:13:10.52
He goes to his corner.

3620
04:13:10.52 --> 04:13:13.52
You go to your corner.

3621
04:13:13.52 --> 04:13:15.52
The, like the call comes.

3622
04:13:15.52 --> 04:13:18.52
Seconds out, which is so in MMA.

3623
04:13:18.52 --> 04:13:19.52
You're, all your corner.

3624
04:13:19.52 --> 04:13:21.52
You know, like I'm, I've been a corner man.

3625
04:13:21.52 --> 04:13:22.52
I'm much like you.

3626
04:13:22.52 --> 04:13:23.52
I'm working on Tim.

3627
04:13:23.52 --> 04:13:24.52
I'm telling you what's up.

3628
04:13:24.52 --> 04:13:25.52
And then the, the ref say seconds out.

3629
04:13:25.52 --> 04:13:28.52
They do that at like 45, 50 seconds.

3630
04:13:28.52 --> 04:13:29.52
They're telling you seconds out.

3631
04:13:29.52 --> 04:13:31.52
That means you as a corner need to get out of,

3632
04:13:31.52 --> 04:13:34.52
get the stool, get the water, get the ice, get all that stuff out of the ring.

3633
04:13:34.52 --> 04:13:36.52
And you got to get that whole out of the ring.

3634
04:13:36.52 --> 04:13:38.52
That call comes.

3635
04:13:38.52 --> 04:13:40.52
His corner doesn't leave.

3636
04:13:40.52 --> 04:13:41.52
Nope.

3637
04:13:41.52 --> 04:13:43.52
Now the round starts.

3638
04:13:43.52 --> 04:13:44.52
Boom.

3639
04:13:44.52 --> 04:13:45.52
Round starts.

3640
04:13:45.52 --> 04:13:48.52
And his corner is like, they spilled ice.

3641
04:13:48.52 --> 04:13:51.52
They're like, they're trying to converse with them.

3642
04:13:51.52 --> 04:13:52.52
They're telling to get out of the ring.

3643
04:13:52.52 --> 04:13:55.52
They're saying they don't know what's going on.

3644
04:13:55.52 --> 04:13:59.52
Another 40 seconds goes by.

3645
04:13:59.52 --> 04:14:01.52
Which, listen.

3646
04:14:01.52 --> 04:14:09.52
47 seconds to recover is, is an an absolutely immense amount of time.

3647
04:14:09.52 --> 04:14:12.52
In this 10 seconds and 10 seconds and boxing,

3648
04:14:12.52 --> 04:14:17.52
it is so much time to recover that it's ridiculous.

3649
04:14:17.52 --> 04:14:19.52
So he doesn't answer the bell.

3650
04:14:19.52 --> 04:14:23.52
So yeah, so if you don't get up, you lose.

3651
04:14:23.52 --> 04:14:26.52
Athletic Commission, the rules are super clear.

3652
04:14:26.52 --> 04:14:28.52
Bell sounds.

3653
04:14:28.52 --> 04:14:33.52
You have tensed. If you are not in the fight in 10 seconds, it's DQ automatically.

3654
04:14:33.52 --> 04:14:39.52
Let's just the way that the rules are read.

3655
04:14:39.52 --> 04:14:50.52
But back to the hudger gracy, you know, at being round fight, the start, the round starts, fight doesn't commence.

3656
04:14:50.52 --> 04:14:52.52
And I look at him not getting up.

3657
04:14:52.52 --> 04:14:54.52
And I see John dealing with things.

3658
04:14:54.52 --> 04:14:56.52
This is how this is going, you said, hudger, this is how well.

3659
04:14:56.52 --> 04:14:57.52
This is against.

3660
04:14:57.52 --> 04:15:01.52
Well, well, but back to hudger gracy, I start departing.

3661
04:15:01.52 --> 04:15:04.52
Like, I start getting the adrenaline, the fights over.

3662
04:15:04.52 --> 04:15:05.52
Oh, this is with hudger.

3663
04:15:05.52 --> 04:15:06.52
No, with hudger.

3664
04:15:06.52 --> 04:15:10.52
What happened with hudger when I got out of his Rene could choke.

3665
04:15:10.52 --> 04:15:12.52
And he had that big adrenaline down.

3666
04:15:12.52 --> 04:15:14.52
I started experiencing the same thing against you.

3667
04:15:14.52 --> 04:15:17.52
Well, where I'm starting to think about my after party.

3668
04:15:17.52 --> 04:15:18.52
My mouth piece is out.

3669
04:15:18.52 --> 04:15:20.52
You know, I'm looking at Dana White being like, you're going to pay me.

3670
04:15:20.52 --> 04:15:22.52
And you're going to give me this title fight.

3671
04:15:22.52 --> 04:15:23.52
I earned this.

3672
04:15:23.52 --> 04:15:24.52
I did the exact what you asked.

3673
04:15:24.52 --> 04:15:26.52
I just beat the breaks off your number two dude.

3674
04:15:26.52 --> 04:15:29.52
You give me Michael Bizbeng and you're going to call me World Champion.

3675
04:15:29.52 --> 04:15:30.52
And then I'm going to say I'm a garbage.

3676
04:15:30.52 --> 04:15:32.52
I'm going to be a garbage man for the rest of my life.

3677
04:15:32.52 --> 04:15:33.52
Because I leave the battle in the crowd.

3678
04:15:33.52 --> 04:15:35.52
I already had this thing going through my head in real time.

3679
04:15:35.52 --> 04:15:36.52
All in that 47.

3680
04:15:36.52 --> 04:15:38.52
Those are the best 47 seconds of your life.

3681
04:15:38.52 --> 04:15:40.52
You're celebrating every which way.

3682
04:15:40.52 --> 04:15:41.52
I'm trying to find my wife.

3683
04:15:41.52 --> 04:15:43.52
You know, like, you know what's coming to the heart.

3684
04:15:43.52 --> 04:15:45.52
But like, you put on them red panties.

3685
04:15:45.52 --> 04:15:47.52
The Connor would say.

3686
04:15:47.52 --> 04:15:50.52
So you are down the road, victory, you're done.

3687
04:15:50.52 --> 04:15:54.52
And all of a sudden, John McCarthy's like, hey, get your mouth piece in.

3688
04:15:54.52 --> 04:15:57.52
Yeah, let's go.

3689
04:15:57.52 --> 04:15:59.52
In the whole time, he's on the stool.

3690
04:15:59.52 --> 04:16:01.52
He's on the stool just looking at me.

3691
04:16:01.52 --> 04:16:04.52
It's freaking, just getting back in the zone.

3692
04:16:04.52 --> 04:16:06.52
We're going to opposite directions, right?

3693
04:16:06.52 --> 04:16:07.52
He's fighting his way back into the fight.

3694
04:16:07.52 --> 04:16:08.52
I'm going to find my way out of the fight.

3695
04:16:08.52 --> 04:16:10.52
You know, fall on me.

3696
04:16:10.52 --> 04:16:11.52
Failure.

3697
04:16:11.52 --> 04:16:12.52
Failure on me.

3698
04:16:12.52 --> 04:16:14.52
You know, I should have just sitting there.

3699
04:16:14.52 --> 04:16:15.52
Just staring at him.

3700
04:16:15.52 --> 04:16:18.52
You take every second you want.

3701
04:16:18.52 --> 04:16:21.52
I'm going to take that in years off your life.

3702
04:16:21.52 --> 04:16:23.52
And you finally stand up.

3703
04:16:23.52 --> 04:16:25.52
Now what I was doing.

3704
04:16:25.52 --> 04:16:28.52
So you get up and now he catches you.

3705
04:16:28.52 --> 04:16:31.52
And you get caught.

3706
04:16:31.52 --> 04:16:35.52
You lose.

3707
04:16:35.52 --> 04:16:40.52
I don't yell at the TV very much.

3708
04:16:40.52 --> 04:16:44.52
I was a fucking I rate bro.

3709
04:16:44.52 --> 04:16:49.52
I was so, I couldn't, I, yeah.

3710
04:16:49.52 --> 04:16:51.52
That was ridiculous.

3711
04:16:51.52 --> 04:16:55.52
And, and really what that means is so everyone in the big picture.

3712
04:16:55.52 --> 04:17:00.52
Like, you get a shot where you're one shot away from the title shot.

3713
04:17:00.52 --> 04:17:01.52
One time in your career.

3714
04:17:01.52 --> 04:17:02.52
Yeah.

3715
04:17:02.52 --> 04:17:03.52
You get that.

3716
04:17:03.52 --> 04:17:05.52
And then you either win.

3717
04:17:05.52 --> 04:17:08.52
And in most cases, that's your shot.

3718
04:17:08.52 --> 04:17:10.52
You know, that's like, uh, raging bull, right?

3719
04:17:10.52 --> 04:17:11.52
This was my shot.

3720
04:17:11.52 --> 04:17:12.52
This is your shot.

3721
04:17:12.52 --> 04:17:13.52
You know, that was your shot.

3722
04:17:13.52 --> 04:17:14.52
That was my shot.

3723
04:17:14.52 --> 04:17:17.52
And you bust your ass for all those years to get to that point.

3724
04:17:17.52 --> 04:17:19.52
You had it.

3725
04:17:19.52 --> 04:17:21.52
And then it's gone.

3726
04:17:21.52 --> 04:17:22.52
Yeah.

3727
04:17:22.52 --> 04:17:23.52
And gone in the worst way.

3728
04:17:23.52 --> 04:17:24.52
Yeah.

3729
04:17:24.52 --> 04:17:25.52
And that's, that's what hurts.

3730
04:17:25.52 --> 04:17:29.52
Like, you know, if I lost, you know, it's just like, got it, man.

3731
04:17:29.52 --> 04:17:30.52
I should have been better.

3732
04:17:30.52 --> 04:17:33.52
You know, but it was like, it felt like it was stolen from me.

3733
04:17:33.52 --> 04:17:35.52
You know, it's, it's just,

3734
04:17:35.52 --> 04:17:37.52
Yeah.

3735
04:17:37.52 --> 04:17:39.52
Yeah.

3736
04:17:39.52 --> 04:17:42.52
And I don't know if we were recording when I said this, but like,

3737
04:17:42.52 --> 04:17:45.52
For me, I like swore at the TV.

3738
04:17:45.52 --> 04:17:46.52
And it was all mad.

3739
04:17:46.52 --> 04:17:48.52
And then I like, got another piece of chicken and went about my way.

3740
04:17:48.52 --> 04:17:51.52
And you, like, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,

3741
04:17:51.52 --> 04:17:56.52
you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you get to the locker room.

3742
04:17:56.52 --> 04:17:57.52
What do you think when you get to the locker room?

3743
04:17:57.52 --> 04:17:59.52
What when I'm walking to the back?

3744
04:17:59.52 --> 04:18:01.52
Your well comes up and grabs me.

3745
04:18:01.52 --> 04:18:03.52
And he's like, hey, man, I'm so sorry.

3746
04:18:03.52 --> 04:18:05.52
You know, like, oh, you, you, you fucking speaking English now.

3747
04:18:05.52 --> 04:18:08.52
You didn't speak English five minutes ago when you went get off the stool

3748
04:18:08.52 --> 04:18:10.52
and you're pretending like you don't speak English.

3749
04:18:10.52 --> 04:18:11.52
You know, like, not get off, man.

3750
04:18:11.52 --> 04:18:12.52
You know the rules.

3751
04:18:12.52 --> 04:18:13.52
You broke the rules.

3752
04:18:13.52 --> 04:18:14.52
You cheated.

3753
04:18:14.52 --> 04:18:15.52
You didn't answer the bell.

3754
04:18:15.52 --> 04:18:16.52
The fight's over.

3755
04:18:16.52 --> 04:18:19.52
He's like, I know what, I know I'm, and then his quarters trying to pull him away

3756
04:18:19.52 --> 04:18:22.52
as he's seen here apologizing for cheating.

3757
04:18:22.52 --> 04:18:26.52
And I, and I'm just like, you know, I, this is on you, this is on your conscience.

3758
04:18:26.52 --> 04:18:30.52
This is on John, John messed up, you know, big John McCarthy should have called it.

3759
04:18:30.52 --> 04:18:32.52
Um, did you protest?

3760
04:18:32.52 --> 04:18:35.52
Did you put, nah, I never protested a fight ever.

3761
04:18:35.52 --> 04:18:37.52
I don't know, bro.

3762
04:18:37.52 --> 04:18:40.52
I respect that, but I think I would have been like, there's one time to catch

3763
04:18:40.52 --> 04:18:43.52
in those chips on, on not.

3764
04:18:43.52 --> 04:18:47.52
So, like, I'm going to, I'm going to get a title fight off a contested fight.

3765
04:18:47.52 --> 04:18:49.52
I don't know, everyone watched it.

3766
04:18:49.52 --> 04:18:51.52
Everyone saw this dude sit on the stool not answering the bell.

3767
04:18:51.52 --> 04:18:55.52
That's literally called stool gate, but it's still, I don't want to title fight that way.

3768
04:18:55.52 --> 04:18:57.52
Could they ask for a rematch?

3769
04:18:57.52 --> 04:18:58.52
I don't know.

3770
04:18:58.52 --> 04:18:59.52
Yeah.

3771
04:18:59.52 --> 04:19:00.52
You know what I'm saying?

3772
04:19:00.52 --> 04:19:01.52
Holmes.

3773
04:19:01.52 --> 04:19:02.52
No, no.

3774
04:19:02.52 --> 04:19:04.52
But you did the honorable thing.

3775
04:19:04.52 --> 04:19:06.52
Hey, Roger that, I lost.

3776
04:19:06.52 --> 04:19:08.52
Are you thinking about retirement?

3777
04:19:08.52 --> 04:19:12.52
Yeah, this is the beginning of moving on.

3778
04:19:12.52 --> 04:19:18.52
The, uh, this is, you know, they, they give me a group of reshot events

3779
04:19:18.52 --> 04:19:20.52
at a Madison Square.

3780
04:19:20.52 --> 04:19:26.52
And, um, that, that fight, you know, being a former teammate had a lot of, you know,

3781
04:19:26.52 --> 04:19:28.52
I, I'm really confident in this fight.

3782
04:19:28.52 --> 04:19:31.52
And it is also used a former title contender.

3783
04:19:31.52 --> 04:19:33.52
It's a co-mate event with Connor.

3784
04:19:33.52 --> 04:19:38.52
Um, this, this, I mean, this is a fight that puts you back into title contention.

3785
04:19:38.52 --> 04:19:42.52
And, um, so with that, I'm okay.

3786
04:19:42.52 --> 04:19:43.52
Maybe not very often.

3787
04:19:43.52 --> 04:19:44.52
Do you get a second chance?

3788
04:19:44.52 --> 04:19:46.52
Do you get a second shot?

3789
04:19:46.52 --> 04:19:51.52
And, uh, I flanned in New York, um, the weekend for the Madison Square Gardens fight.

3790
04:19:51.52 --> 04:19:54.52
My plane lands, and I get a text saying,

3791
04:19:54.52 --> 04:19:58.52
Rashad can't pass as medical, the fights off.

3792
04:19:58.52 --> 04:20:04.52
You know, that was kind of like, that was the second strike into the, what am I going to do in the fighting world?

3793
04:20:04.52 --> 04:20:06.52
When that Rashad fight fell through.

3794
04:20:06.52 --> 04:20:11.52
I had a cut weight real bad to, they wouldn't pay me my fight first unless I made weight.

3795
04:20:11.52 --> 04:20:13.52
God, those savages.

3796
04:20:13.52 --> 04:20:17.52
So I had to cut hard to make that weight.

3797
04:20:17.52 --> 04:20:21.52
And then they made me fight five weeks later against Calvin Gesslam.

3798
04:20:21.52 --> 04:20:22.52
Uh-huh.

3799
04:20:22.52 --> 04:20:24.52
So then I had to cut weight again five weeks later.

3800
04:20:24.52 --> 04:20:26.52
And I was trashed.

3801
04:20:26.52 --> 04:20:30.52
And that was the third, and final nail in the coffin of being like I'm done fighting.

3802
04:20:30.52 --> 04:20:36.52
Meanwhile, you got a chapter in here.

3803
04:20:36.52 --> 04:20:39.52
And that's called TV in a movie.

3804
04:20:39.52 --> 04:20:45.52
You're just like, uh, getting after it in like 47 different directions.

3805
04:20:45.52 --> 04:20:50.52
You end up doing the deadliest warrior, which was flutter.

3806
04:20:50.52 --> 04:20:56.52
You give, you give such little details in here about your, you, in that show.

3807
04:20:56.52 --> 04:21:00.52
You're going against, uh, what, Koreans, was it?

3808
04:21:00.52 --> 04:21:02.52
Yeah, Korean Special Operations, guys.

3809
04:21:02.52 --> 04:21:11.52
And, uh, and the, and the show people say, hey, can you put some colds in their target that are closer to the bull's eye?

3810
04:21:11.52 --> 04:21:14.52
So this looks like a little bit tougher than like challenge for you.

3811
04:21:14.52 --> 04:21:15.52
Yeah.

3812
04:21:15.52 --> 04:21:16.52
And you're like, I guess so.

3813
04:21:16.52 --> 04:21:17.52
Not a problem.

3814
04:21:17.52 --> 04:21:20.52
They, it was so, it was so, it's supposed to be television.

3815
04:21:20.52 --> 04:21:22.52
It's supposed to be close and competitive and exciting.

3816
04:21:22.52 --> 04:21:25.52
Um, you know, and they couldn't, they couldn't hit anything.

3817
04:21:25.52 --> 04:21:26.52
Right.

3818
04:21:26.52 --> 04:21:32.52
So I would go every shot that you saw the Koreans take the Korean Special Forces guys take on their targets.

3819
04:21:32.52 --> 04:21:33.52
I shot for them.

3820
04:21:33.52 --> 04:21:34.52
Every single one of them.

3821
04:21:34.52 --> 04:21:36.52
There was not a single shot that I didn't shoot.

3822
04:21:36.52 --> 04:21:39.52
So I ended up doing all of the shooting for the whole entire show.

3823
04:21:39.52 --> 04:21:41.52
Okay.

3824
04:21:41.52 --> 04:21:42.52
So you do that.

3825
04:21:42.52 --> 04:21:48.52
You do something called ultimate soldier challenge, which is you and, uh, another green beret.

3826
04:21:48.52 --> 04:21:51.52
And you're going against, uh, pair of contractors.

3827
04:21:51.52 --> 04:21:53.52
You're going against a pair of Norwegian.

3828
04:21:53.52 --> 04:21:55.52
And you guys kick ass again.

3829
04:21:55.52 --> 04:22:00.52
And once again, you have to like re-shoot stuff so that it doesn't look like you're crushing everyone.

3830
04:22:00.52 --> 04:22:01.52
So yeah.

3831
04:22:01.52 --> 04:22:02.52
This is bad TV.

3832
04:22:02.52 --> 04:22:07.52
And, you know, it's, um, but they're taking war fighters that are like doing real war.

3833
04:22:07.52 --> 04:22:10.52
I think throwing him into these competition shows.

3834
04:22:10.52 --> 04:22:12.52
And like shooting competition.

3835
04:22:12.52 --> 04:22:18.52
And they, like, all we've done for the past 15 years is, uh, shoot things.

3836
04:22:18.52 --> 04:22:21.52
So it was not a good television.

3837
04:22:21.52 --> 04:22:26.52
Uh, this is my personal favorite celebrity boot camp season seven boot camp.

3838
04:22:26.52 --> 04:22:27.52
To.

3839
04:22:27.52 --> 04:22:30.52
I'm figuring it out.

3840
04:22:30.52 --> 04:22:34.52
I haven't, don't the worst people on the planet.

3841
04:22:34.52 --> 04:22:36.52
Actually, no, the second worst.

3842
04:22:36.52 --> 04:22:42.52
Now that I'm working in the non-profit kind of NGO space, especially humanitarian aid and evacuation.

3843
04:22:42.52 --> 04:22:45.52
And like, really, really important work.

3844
04:22:45.52 --> 04:22:50.52
The people that, that are evil in that world, they're the most evil.

3845
04:22:50.52 --> 04:22:55.52
I, I hope that I can someday call them by name and be like, you pretended that you're doing humanitarian aid,

3846
04:22:55.52 --> 04:22:59.52
but you're paying yourself 10,000 a day to go, not really do anything at all,

3847
04:22:59.52 --> 04:23:02.52
but then you went in front of cameras and said that you rescued all these Afghanis.

3848
04:23:02.52 --> 04:23:03.52
I know the truth, you weren't there.

3849
04:23:03.52 --> 04:23:04.52
You're a liar.

3850
04:23:04.52 --> 04:23:05.52
Some day I'll get to you.

3851
04:23:05.52 --> 04:23:12.52
But besides them, these people, these like Hollywood second string people are so pathetic.

3852
04:23:12.52 --> 04:23:13.52
How tough.

3853
04:23:13.52 --> 04:23:15.52
They're so pathetic.

3854
04:23:15.52 --> 04:23:18.52
Uh, co-ceds, liars, manipulators.

3855
04:23:18.52 --> 04:23:22.52
Is it like, is it like a whole season you do this for?

3856
04:23:22.52 --> 04:23:23.52
Or is it just one show?

3857
04:23:23.52 --> 04:23:25.52
I do, I do, it's a whole season for them.

3858
04:23:25.52 --> 04:23:29.52
Yeah, but the way that, I think there's like a VH1 show.

3859
04:23:29.52 --> 04:23:35.52
They had like a dedicated drill sergeant that would take these people through a season.

3860
04:23:35.52 --> 04:23:41.52
And then they would bring in people every episode that would do different challenges and different types of fitness things.

3861
04:23:41.52 --> 04:23:47.52
So they were, they would take these really fat, soft body, gelatinous people.

3862
04:23:47.52 --> 04:23:50.52
And try to get them hard in the season.

3863
04:23:50.52 --> 04:23:52.52
It's a perilous endeavor.

3864
04:23:52.52 --> 04:23:57.52
Uh, you can't make a marshmallow getting shaped.

3865
04:23:57.52 --> 04:23:59.52
Like that's just, it's a marshmallow.

3866
04:23:59.52 --> 04:24:01.52
I don't fire.

3867
04:24:01.52 --> 04:24:03.52
Hunting Hitler.

3868
04:24:03.52 --> 04:24:05.52
Yeah, it's very, pretty rad.

3869
04:24:05.52 --> 04:24:10.52
Um, you, you're out searching for Nazis is what you're doing.

3870
04:24:10.52 --> 04:24:11.52
Yep.

3871
04:24:11.52 --> 04:24:15.52
And you find like Nazi stuff, man, everywhere and Nazis.

3872
04:24:15.52 --> 04:24:16.52
Yeah.

3873
04:24:16.52 --> 04:24:18.52
Nazi stuff, you find Nazis.

3874
04:24:18.52 --> 04:24:19.52
What do you do though?

3875
04:24:19.52 --> 04:24:24.52
Like, so you're, like, get off active duty and somebody from New York with a Jewish accent called

3876
04:24:24.52 --> 04:24:26.52
as you and say, hey, Joaquo.

3877
04:24:26.52 --> 04:24:28.52
You can play a drone.

3878
04:24:28.52 --> 04:24:30.52
You can do ground penetrating radar.

3879
04:24:30.52 --> 04:24:34.52
Would, what would you think about me paying you to travel the world to hunt Nazis?

3880
04:24:34.52 --> 04:24:35.52
Yeah.

3881
04:24:35.52 --> 04:24:36.52
Right.

3882
04:24:36.52 --> 04:24:37.52
Yeah.

3883
04:24:37.52 --> 04:24:38.52
You know, like, okay.

3884
04:24:38.52 --> 04:24:39.52
All right.

3885
04:24:39.52 --> 04:24:40.52
This is amazing.

3886
04:24:40.52 --> 04:24:40.52
Yeah.

3887
04:24:40.52 --> 04:24:41.52
Best thing ever.

3888
04:24:41.52 --> 04:24:43.52
I was in.

3889
04:24:43.52 --> 04:24:45.52
Uh, and that ends up running for three seasons.

3890
04:24:45.52 --> 04:24:50.52
And we've got a fourth season that was going to be completely bonkers.

3891
04:24:50.52 --> 04:24:51.52
And what happened?

3892
04:24:51.52 --> 04:24:54.52
Pist her channel lost lost their balls.

3893
04:24:54.52 --> 04:24:56.52
What was, what were you guys going to do in that third one?

3894
04:24:56.52 --> 04:24:59.52
We're going to talk about Operation Paperclip.

3895
04:24:59.52 --> 04:25:02.52
Uh, so we traded Nazi scientists.

3896
04:25:02.52 --> 04:25:04.52
Uh, we gave them kind of leniency.

3897
04:25:04.52 --> 04:25:11.52
We gave them free passes for their crimes as Nazis to come work on the space program as we're

3898
04:25:11.52 --> 04:25:14.52
fighting now the Russians in the space race.

3899
04:25:14.52 --> 04:25:16.52
So that was one part of it.

3900
04:25:16.52 --> 04:25:18.52
Um, another part was a bunch of the Nazis.

3901
04:25:18.52 --> 04:25:20.52
One of the rat lines that we didn't cover.

3902
04:25:20.52 --> 04:25:25.52
We covered people going through Norway and going through the church and people going, um, into South America.

3903
04:25:25.52 --> 04:25:29.52
One that we didn't cover was going to North Africa and into the Middle East.

3904
04:25:29.52 --> 04:25:32.52
A whole bunch of Nazis went to North Africa and then the least.

3905
04:25:32.52 --> 04:25:36.52
And, um, the founders of the Mujahideen, you know, as we pulled all these photographs,

3906
04:25:36.52 --> 04:25:39.52
when we started figuring out who all these people were, a facial recognition,

3907
04:25:39.52 --> 04:25:41.52
you would see founders of the Mujahideen.

3908
04:25:41.52 --> 04:25:43.52
You'd see all these like little brown dudes.

3909
04:25:43.52 --> 04:25:47.52
And then you'd see this tall six foot three blonde hair blue eye guy.

3910
04:25:47.52 --> 04:25:48.52
You know, okay.

3911
04:25:48.52 --> 04:25:50.52
This is 1946.

3912
04:25:50.52 --> 04:25:51.52
And, uh, who is this guy?

3913
04:25:51.52 --> 04:25:52.52
I gave facial recognition.

3914
04:25:52.52 --> 04:25:53.52
Oh, that is Scorsenski.

3915
04:25:53.52 --> 04:25:58.52
What is Scorsenski doing in Saudi Arabia with the founders of the Mujahideen?

3916
04:25:58.52 --> 04:26:02.52
As we know, a Kaita ISIS, the Taliban, the PLO.

3917
04:26:02.52 --> 04:26:06.52
And, um, like, what do they have in common with them?

3918
04:26:06.52 --> 04:26:08.52
Oh, they want to kill Jews.

3919
04:26:08.52 --> 04:26:09.52
Cool.

3920
04:26:09.52 --> 04:26:12.52
As Israel is trying to become a state.

3921
04:26:12.52 --> 04:26:14.52
And they're fighting for partition, right?

3922
04:26:14.52 --> 04:26:17.52
Go to mayor is like trying to, how are we going to become a country?

3923
04:26:17.52 --> 04:26:20.52
And they're buying PT109s from German surplus.

3924
04:26:20.52 --> 04:26:24.52
They're preparing to like the invasion of every single country around them.

3925
04:26:24.52 --> 04:26:28.52
Those, all of those countries were being advised by former Nazis.

3926
04:26:28.52 --> 04:26:33.52
So, history of Canada was like, uh, we're not touching this, man.

3927
04:26:33.52 --> 04:26:37.52
So, the corporations that were funding it from VW to Mercedes, you know,

3928
04:26:37.52 --> 04:26:39.52
like, oh, this is real.

3929
04:26:39.52 --> 04:26:40.52
Nice.

3930
04:26:40.52 --> 04:26:41.52
No way.

3931
04:26:41.52 --> 04:26:42.52
Can we talk about any of this stuff?

3932
04:26:42.52 --> 04:26:45.52
It's relevant currently, because some of these organizations still exist today.

3933
04:26:45.52 --> 04:26:51.52
Some of them are political organizations that are now lobbying for relevancy.

3934
04:26:51.52 --> 04:26:53.52
And, um, so, yep, nope.

3935
04:26:53.52 --> 04:26:55.52
Can't talk about any of this.

3936
04:26:55.52 --> 04:26:56.52
Yeah.

3937
04:26:56.52 --> 04:26:57.52
So, that was that.

3938
04:26:57.52 --> 04:26:58.52
That was that.

3939
04:26:58.52 --> 04:27:00.52
Luckily, you had a movie to make.

3940
04:27:00.52 --> 04:27:01.52
Yeah.

3941
04:27:01.52 --> 04:27:02.52
Yeah.

3942
04:27:02.52 --> 04:27:05.52
A naked tim Kennedy fighting Randy Kaitour.

3943
04:27:05.52 --> 04:27:09.52
Uh, you laughing at it, or zombie Randy Kaitour.

3944
04:27:09.52 --> 04:27:10.52
A naked tim Kennedy.

3945
04:27:10.52 --> 04:27:11.52
Both of them.

3946
04:27:11.52 --> 04:27:12.52
Both of them.

3947
04:27:12.52 --> 04:27:13.52
They're not even a single single.

3948
04:27:13.52 --> 04:27:14.52
They're not even a single single.

3949
04:27:14.52 --> 04:27:15.52
They're not even a single single.

3950
04:27:15.52 --> 04:27:23.52
I, uh, when that movie came out, one of my friends is a writer and director and stuff up in Hollywood.

3951
04:27:23.52 --> 04:27:28.52
And he is friends with Rocco.

3952
04:27:28.52 --> 04:27:31.52
And he got me said, hey, this Rocco is in the movie.

3953
04:27:31.52 --> 04:27:32.52
I want to come up.

3954
04:27:32.52 --> 04:27:33.52
And I was like, the premier.

3955
04:27:33.52 --> 04:27:35.52
And I was like, oh, yeah, the article 15.

3956
04:27:35.52 --> 04:27:37.52
And I was like, hell, yeah, I'll come and see that.

3957
04:27:37.52 --> 04:27:40.52
So I go and watch the premier up there in Hollywood.

3958
04:27:40.52 --> 04:27:43.52
And, um, actually were you there?

3959
04:27:43.52 --> 04:27:44.52
No.

3960
04:27:44.52 --> 04:27:45.52
Okay.

3961
04:27:45.52 --> 04:27:46.52
No.

3962
04:27:46.52 --> 04:27:47.52
I'm trying to think of who I ran into people.

3963
04:27:47.52 --> 04:27:53.52
Anyways, Matt Best Evan, uh, Nick, Jared, and Rocco were at the Hollywood one.

3964
04:27:53.52 --> 04:27:54.52
Okay.

3965
04:27:54.52 --> 04:27:55.52
Well, I'm sure I ran into those guys.

3966
04:27:55.52 --> 04:27:56.52
I don't think I knew any of them yet.

3967
04:27:56.52 --> 04:28:00.52
But, um, so I like watch this movie.

3968
04:28:00.52 --> 04:28:04.52
And I'm expecting it to be, you know, bad.

3969
04:28:04.52 --> 04:28:06.52
A little over the top or not.

3970
04:28:06.52 --> 04:28:09.52
No, I didn't expect to be bad, like bad, uh, like a bad movie.

3971
04:28:09.52 --> 04:28:12.52
But I thought, you know, it'll be kind of crazy.

3972
04:28:12.52 --> 04:28:13.52
I watch the movie.

3973
04:28:13.52 --> 04:28:15.52
I was like, oh, no.

3974
04:28:15.52 --> 04:28:19.52
There is, there is no, that's a no hold bar movie.

3975
04:28:19.52 --> 04:28:21.52
That is a no hold bar movie, 100%.

3976
04:28:21.52 --> 04:28:22.52
No.

3977
04:28:22.52 --> 04:28:22.52
No.

3978
04:28:22.52 --> 04:28:23.52
No.

3979
04:28:23.52 --> 04:28:23.52
No.

3980
04:28:23.52 --> 04:28:24.52
No.

3981
04:28:24.52 --> 04:28:28.52
They're trying to put a turn and get on this guy's pelvis.

3982
04:28:28.52 --> 04:28:30.52
And he have two metal of honor recipients.

3983
04:28:30.52 --> 04:28:35.52
You know, leeway, P tree is like, who is already missing a hand from throwing a grenade.

3984
04:28:35.52 --> 04:28:39.52
As another metal of honor recipient is trying to throw a turn and get on his other hand

3985
04:28:39.52 --> 04:28:41.52
after he just got his other hand blown up.

3986
04:28:41.52 --> 04:28:43.52
It is so dark and so terrible.

3987
04:28:43.52 --> 04:28:46.52
It is, it is insane.

3988
04:28:46.52 --> 04:28:47.52
It's insane.

3989
04:28:47.52 --> 04:28:49.52
Uh, it's a shocking movie.

3990
04:28:49.52 --> 04:28:51.52
How good did that movie do?

3991
04:28:51.52 --> 04:28:56.52
So it was the number one independent film ever up to that point.

3992
04:28:56.52 --> 04:29:03.52
Oh, so, but number one privately sourced and it'd be number one on Amazon number two on Apple

3993
04:29:03.52 --> 04:29:07.52
and the number one movie to date up to that point.

3994
04:29:07.52 --> 04:29:12.52
Uh, my couple movies have passed us now as an independently sourced and finally it's

3995
04:29:12.52 --> 04:29:13.52
film.

3996
04:29:13.52 --> 04:29:15.52
It's freaking crazy.

3997
04:29:15.52 --> 04:29:20.52
And I remember watching it going, well, I guess we're going to find out what the limits are.

3998
04:29:20.52 --> 04:29:23.52
There are no limits in that movie at all.

3999
04:29:23.52 --> 04:29:24.52
It's nuts.

4000
04:29:24.52 --> 04:29:26.52
It was so fun though.

4001
04:29:26.52 --> 04:29:31.52
Yeah, but it was, it was, it was the veteran community came together to do it.

4002
04:29:31.52 --> 04:29:37.52
You know, there were all of wounded veterans coming without limbs to be our zombies.

4003
04:29:37.52 --> 04:29:38.52
Yeah.

4004
04:29:38.52 --> 04:29:44.52
Like volunteer to do it, the hountain the sun, you know, is in LA at the middle of the summer.

4005
04:29:44.52 --> 04:29:49.52
The whole entire fight world, you know, we had really like top 20 dudes on the planet

4006
04:29:49.52 --> 04:29:55.52
showed up to be like the super zombies to include Randy Kittor, Phil Davis and keyjardine,

4007
04:29:55.52 --> 04:29:57.52
Julie Kenzie.

4008
04:29:57.52 --> 04:30:02.52
Um, crazy.

4009
04:30:02.52 --> 04:30:05.52
Yeah, yeah, it's just epic.

4010
04:30:05.52 --> 04:30:09.52
Um, so if you haven't watched that yet, check that out.

4011
04:30:09.52 --> 04:30:15.52
Uh, then you do this show called Hard to Kill, which is bizarre because a dude freaky.

4012
04:30:15.52 --> 04:30:22.52
A dude freaky locked you into a damn fiery fake cockpit of an airplane.

4013
04:30:22.52 --> 04:30:28.52
Yeah, I was an experimental aircraft and they drenched it with aviation fuel and they took a screw

4014
04:30:28.52 --> 04:30:30.52
and they drilled it into the back of the cockpit.

4015
04:30:30.52 --> 04:30:33.52
So the canopy went open and then they set it on fire.

4016
04:30:33.52 --> 04:30:34.52
Yeah.

4017
04:30:34.52 --> 04:30:37.52
So let me just give a little more info from the book.

4018
04:30:37.52 --> 04:30:41.52
You think to yourself, okay, here's uh, here's what we're going to do.

4019
04:30:41.52 --> 04:30:43.52
They say we want you to escape from this burning cockpit.

4020
04:30:43.52 --> 04:30:44.52
You go, okay, cool.

4021
04:30:44.52 --> 04:30:47.52
If I'm going to get into a place that's on fire, I'm going to make sure I can get out.

4022
04:30:47.52 --> 04:30:50.52
So you drill this, you rehearse it, you go through the motions on the UC bill.

4023
04:30:50.52 --> 04:30:55.52
Whenever here's how you open this thing, you go through it over and over again, like any normal soldier would rehearse

4024
04:30:55.52 --> 04:30:58.52
of potentially life threatening evolution.

4025
04:30:58.52 --> 04:31:00.52
So you get it done.

4026
04:31:00.52 --> 04:31:01.52
You're like, okay, now I'm ready.

4027
04:31:01.52 --> 04:31:06.52
Now you can put gasoline on this thing and I'll sit in it and you can light it on fire.

4028
04:31:06.52 --> 04:31:07.52
Now I'll get out.

4029
04:31:07.52 --> 04:31:11.52
I'll go through the procedures that I've just rehearsed a hundred times to make sure that I don't die in here.

4030
04:31:11.52 --> 04:31:16.52
Well, some freaking jackass wanted it to be better.

4031
04:31:16.52 --> 04:31:26.52
So put one single screw in the back of the cockpit where you are actually now walked in this bitch.

4032
04:31:26.52 --> 04:31:29.52
Yep.

4033
04:31:29.52 --> 04:31:31.52
Yeah, I mean, he wasn't wrong.

4034
04:31:31.52 --> 04:31:32.52
It ended up being really great.

4035
04:31:32.52 --> 04:31:34.52
I was a great team.

4036
04:31:34.52 --> 04:31:37.52
So the cockpit ultimately didn't open.

4037
04:31:37.52 --> 04:31:39.52
I paired.

4038
04:31:39.52 --> 04:31:43.52
I tore the entire canopy out of the aircraft.

4039
04:31:43.52 --> 04:31:44.52
Like that's how it got out.

4040
04:31:44.52 --> 04:31:51.52
I tore through all the fiberglass and the plastic that that around the fuselage of the canopy of the aircraft to finally get out.

4041
04:31:51.52 --> 04:31:55.52
Burned my back, melted my t-shirt, melted the seat belt for me to get out of this.

4042
04:31:55.52 --> 04:31:57.52
And this was their second plan.

4043
04:31:57.52 --> 04:32:02.52
Their first plan was to set this thing on fire and push it out the back of an aircraft.

4044
04:32:02.52 --> 04:32:04.52
So then I would fight it my way out of it.

4045
04:32:04.52 --> 04:32:07.52
Then I would go into free fall as if I injected like a halo.

4046
04:32:07.52 --> 04:32:10.52
And then I would parachute down into the ground.

4047
04:32:10.52 --> 04:32:12.52
That was their first plan.

4048
04:32:12.52 --> 04:32:15.52
When the insurance company said no, this was the second plan.

4049
04:32:15.52 --> 04:32:25.52
So they ended up taking my visor and frosting it over and covering it and then throwing me out of the back of an aircraft in a blind folded free fall.

4050
04:32:25.52 --> 04:32:31.52
That happened in the same episode that they screwed me inside of an experimental aircraft.

4051
04:32:31.52 --> 04:32:36.52
Draught, doused it in aviation fuel and then set it on fire.

4052
04:32:36.52 --> 04:32:38.52
Yeah.

4053
04:32:38.52 --> 04:32:41.52
My television time has come to an end.

4054
04:32:41.52 --> 04:32:45.52
What the hell is up with that?

4055
04:32:45.52 --> 04:32:48.52
The start of this show was really altruistic.

4056
04:32:48.52 --> 04:32:56.52
We wanted to highlight, not dirty jobs is going in and showing all the cool things that blue collar workers do.

4057
04:32:56.52 --> 04:33:00.52
And I think there were a lot of people that do really incredible jobs that don't get any credit.

4058
04:33:00.52 --> 04:33:07.52
And that was the goal was to go and highlight some of these people that every single day go out and do really really rad things.

4059
04:33:07.52 --> 04:33:10.52
You're not just for sure, responders, even though they do it every single day.

4060
04:33:10.52 --> 04:33:16.52
But the guy that climbs up to the top of the cell tower to make sure that the flashing bulb works.

4061
04:33:16.52 --> 04:33:17.52
That's sketchy.

4062
04:33:17.52 --> 04:33:18.52
That's dangerous.

4063
04:33:18.52 --> 04:33:24.52
Like electricity, static electricity, just the wind, as it takes you two hours to get to the top of that.

4064
04:33:24.52 --> 04:33:27.52
The temperature could change.

4065
04:33:27.52 --> 04:33:35.52
You know, guys that go deep sea welding on mixed gas is trying to fix pipes that that's super sketch.

4066
04:33:35.52 --> 04:33:37.52
You know, you make a cut the wrong way.

4067
04:33:37.52 --> 04:33:39.52
You're using a torch or a welder.

4068
04:33:39.52 --> 04:33:41.52
And that bead drops through in that pipe.

4069
04:33:41.52 --> 04:33:43.52
That's over pressure.

4070
04:33:43.52 --> 04:33:44.52
Your dead.

4071
04:33:44.52 --> 04:33:53.52
And it went from a really cool show talking about this group, great group of Americans doing very American things to like, let's see if we can kill Tim.

4072
04:33:53.52 --> 04:33:56.52
No, I don't want to do it anymore.

4073
04:33:56.52 --> 04:33:58.52
So what'd you do one season of that?

4074
04:33:58.52 --> 04:33:59.52
Yeah.

4075
04:33:59.52 --> 04:34:01.52
Hard past.

4076
04:34:01.52 --> 04:34:02.52
Yeah.

4077
04:34:02.52 --> 04:34:10.52
You got this section in here about human trafficking.

4078
04:34:10.52 --> 04:34:15.52
And you get connected with a group called Deliver Fund.

4079
04:34:15.52 --> 04:34:16.52
Mm-hmm.

4080
04:34:16.52 --> 04:34:26.52
And what they do is they do their best to get in there and get people out of these situations and help set up law enforcement to arrest human traffickers.

4081
04:34:26.52 --> 04:34:28.52
Is that an accurate description?

4082
04:34:28.52 --> 04:34:29.52
That's right.

4083
04:34:29.52 --> 04:34:33.52
And they're slightly different now, but at the time that was there.

4084
04:34:33.52 --> 04:34:35.52
That was what they were doing.

4085
04:34:35.52 --> 04:34:37.52
Yeah.

4086
04:34:37.52 --> 04:34:40.52
You end up working on a team that's doing this.

4087
04:34:40.52 --> 04:34:43.52
You end up doing surveillance and again,

4088
04:34:43.52 --> 04:34:45.52
Ham, skipping through a bunch of stuff right now.

4089
04:34:45.52 --> 04:34:47.52
Get the book for all these details.

4090
04:34:47.52 --> 04:34:48.52
But you end up doing surveillance.

4091
04:34:48.52 --> 04:34:51.52
You're putting together target packages for the police.

4092
04:34:51.52 --> 04:34:58.52
And I thought this was a man in lightning and scary and disturbing and horrible.

4093
04:34:58.52 --> 04:35:02.52
And informative thing to learn about.

4094
04:35:02.52 --> 04:35:07.52
I'm going to go to the book here on what you saw.

4095
04:35:07.52 --> 04:35:11.52
The situation almost always looks the same.

4096
04:35:11.52 --> 04:35:16.52
Trafficking operations run out of hotels or motels on the ground floor.

4097
04:35:16.52 --> 04:35:22.52
There is a madam or called bottom bitch, got a hair.

4098
04:35:22.52 --> 04:35:24.52
The bottom bitch is pure eivost.

4099
04:35:24.52 --> 04:35:28.52
She's usually 25 to 30 years old and she is fucking the pimple.

4100
04:35:28.52 --> 04:35:33.52
She used to be one of the girls, but for whatever reason she showed loyalty or skill.

4101
04:35:33.52 --> 04:35:37.52
And she elevated herself out of that part of the business.

4102
04:35:37.52 --> 04:35:40.52
The bottom bitch typically runs four to six girls.

4103
04:35:40.52 --> 04:35:43.52
She recruits them when they aren't just stolen.

4104
04:35:43.52 --> 04:35:47.52
Get's them hooked on meth or heroin.

4105
04:35:47.52 --> 04:35:51.52
Keeps them high and gets them to rest when they're off duty.

4106
04:35:51.52 --> 04:35:56.52
Interacts with John's when they arrive and basically runs the day-to-day operation.

4107
04:35:56.52 --> 04:36:01.52
The reason I say she is pure evil is because she worked the job.

4108
04:36:01.52 --> 04:36:03.52
She knows how terrible it is.

4109
04:36:03.52 --> 04:36:05.52
She knows what it did to her.

4110
04:36:05.52 --> 04:36:08.52
And she is still willing to do the same thing to other girls.

4111
04:36:08.52 --> 04:36:09.52
Girls.

4112
04:36:09.52 --> 04:36:12.52
Little girls.

4113
04:36:12.52 --> 04:36:15.52
The girls are usually 14 to 21.

4114
04:36:15.52 --> 04:36:19.52
And the bottom bitch keeps them in a room together and releases them one at a time

4115
04:36:19.52 --> 04:36:22.52
to rooms they have upstairs when the Johns arrive.

4116
04:36:22.52 --> 04:36:30.52
You usually don't see them older than that because the Johns that prefer non-consensual sex prefer younger girls.

4117
04:36:30.52 --> 04:36:36.52
Once they don't look young anymore, they are either sold in the slavery elsewhere, killed,

4118
04:36:36.52 --> 04:36:39.52
or thrown out onto the streets.

4119
04:36:39.52 --> 04:36:43.52
Now with a heroin habit and no way to get a fix.

4120
04:36:43.52 --> 04:36:48.52
Or if they're smart enough and evil enough, they become the new bottom bitch.

4121
04:36:48.52 --> 04:36:51.52
Back to the Pimp.

4122
04:36:51.52 --> 04:36:56.52
The Pimp always locates himself close enough to get involved if a John gets violent,

4123
04:36:56.52 --> 04:37:01.52
but always far enough away that if the police come he isn't really involved in what's going on.

4124
04:37:01.52 --> 04:37:05.52
The Pimp may only have one bottom bitch where he may have up to five.

4125
04:37:05.52 --> 04:37:12.52
The structure of the relationship of the Pimp and the bottom bitch and the bottom bitch to the girls though is always the same.

4126
04:37:12.52 --> 04:37:15.52
Above the Pimp are the higher end to traffickers.

4127
04:37:15.52 --> 04:37:19.52
What we do is try to get, try to hem up the Pimp's.

4128
04:37:19.52 --> 04:37:24.52
So their asses are on the line and get them to turn on the traffickers.

4129
04:37:27.52 --> 04:37:31.52
So that's a nasty world to say.

4130
04:37:31.52 --> 04:37:40.52
Being overseas so many times in North Africa and in Eastern Europe and South America.

4131
04:37:40.52 --> 04:37:45.52
And like my peripheral I would see this type of nefarious activity.

4132
04:37:45.52 --> 04:37:48.52
But that's not what I was there to do.

4133
04:37:48.52 --> 04:37:52.52
Whether I was there for a fid, Jay said whatever my mission was.

4134
04:37:52.52 --> 04:37:56.52
But I would always see it and it always like ate it me.

4135
04:37:56.52 --> 04:37:59.52
You know, is this naugh of, maybe you can't do anything.

4136
04:37:59.52 --> 04:38:02.52
I wanted to but there's, that's not what I was there for.

4137
04:38:02.52 --> 04:38:06.52
And even in combat zones, you know what see it.

4138
04:38:06.52 --> 04:38:10.52
See the poor little boy with the makeup on. You know what's happened to him.

4139
04:38:10.52 --> 04:38:13.52
You know, would see that young girl that doesn't have her parents anymore.

4140
04:38:13.52 --> 04:38:16.52
And she is just at use of the Taliban.

4141
04:38:16.52 --> 04:38:21.52
And so I really wanted to make a difference in this world.

4142
04:38:21.52 --> 04:38:25.52
And so I started working for multiple different non-profits and NGOs.

4143
04:38:25.52 --> 04:38:30.52
And this, this is the story that I, I, you really used to demonstrate.

4144
04:38:30.52 --> 04:38:32.52
This wasn't just a weekend.

4145
04:38:32.52 --> 04:38:38.52
This was a weekend of many weekends that happens all over the United States and all over the world every weekend.

4146
04:38:38.52 --> 04:38:46.52
And how, how difficult it is to, to make a difference and how hard it is to, to affect change in there.

4147
04:38:46.52 --> 04:38:53.52
And, you know, if you've been to Las Vegas and you get off the strip and you go a couple three or four blocks into the poor areas.

4148
04:38:53.52 --> 04:38:58.52
And you see that third year old girl that is just tore up with scars up and down.

4149
04:38:58.52 --> 04:39:00.52
You know, and she's homeless now.

4150
04:39:00.52 --> 04:39:07.52
Like, this is where she started. Like, this is where she was 15 years ago. If she's alive, which she's very, very one out of a hundred live that long.

4151
04:39:07.52 --> 04:39:14.52
Like the life expectancy of a human trafficked girl is somewhere between eight to ten months.

4152
04:39:14.52 --> 04:39:16.52
Months.

4153
04:39:18.52 --> 04:39:21.52
Are these girls American? Where are these girls from?

4154
04:39:21.52 --> 04:39:23.52
Up here, they were.

4155
04:39:23.52 --> 04:39:29.52
You, depends on like the size of the network.

4156
04:39:29.52 --> 04:39:31.52
You know, when you're, this was happening in Texas.

4157
04:39:31.52 --> 04:39:34.52
So you saw a lot of girls from Louisiana and you saw girls from Florida.

4158
04:39:34.52 --> 04:39:36.52
You saw girls from California.

4159
04:39:36.52 --> 04:39:39.52
You saw girls from New York and New Jersey.

4160
04:39:39.52 --> 04:39:45.52
So there were some great reco type charges as these girls were being trafficked across state lines.

4161
04:39:45.52 --> 04:39:47.52
But that never came to fruition.

4162
04:39:47.52 --> 04:39:49.52
But most of them were American girls.

4163
04:39:49.52 --> 04:39:57.52
And that line between like a consensual prostitute and a traffic person is a very blurry one.

4164
04:39:57.52 --> 04:40:05.52
When, when you have addiction and pimps and, and bottom, the dams involved, like, where is the line of me wanting to be here?

4165
04:40:05.52 --> 04:40:07.52
It's not clearly defined.

4166
04:40:07.52 --> 04:40:11.52
It's really clear when a girl's under 18, but she doesn't have a right to consent.

4167
04:40:11.52 --> 04:40:17.52
But then when you look into that, that girl, even under 18, that girl, she has no home life.

4168
04:40:17.52 --> 04:40:25.52
You know, she was probably coming from a very low-sisicomic minority on a border town.

4169
04:40:25.52 --> 04:40:29.52
She has no place to go. Her mom was probably an addict. Her dad was gone.

4170
04:40:29.52 --> 04:40:31.52
She's never known him.

4171
04:40:31.52 --> 04:40:34.52
So she does have, she doesn't have any other options.

4172
04:40:34.52 --> 04:40:42.52
And it is, it's really, it's heartbreaking to be in that world and try to figure out how can I help.

4173
04:40:42.52 --> 04:40:45.52
You know, and, and like the alpha in me is like, cool.

4174
04:40:45.52 --> 04:40:49.52
Let me find a target. Let me create a target package and we'll prosecute these guys.

4175
04:40:49.52 --> 04:40:53.52
Like, that is the, the simple answer that isn't really the real answer.

4176
04:40:53.52 --> 04:41:01.52
You know, we're talking halfway houses and rehabilitation and, you know, emotional and physical counseling and support for these girls.

4177
04:41:01.52 --> 04:41:03.52
You know, like, I was thinking about any of that stuff.

4178
04:41:03.52 --> 04:41:09.52
I was thinking about being a hammer to these dudes, and which is a small part of the problem.

4179
04:41:09.52 --> 04:41:11.52
Yeah, on this particular one.

4180
04:41:11.52 --> 04:41:13.52
Obviously it's not dead.

4181
04:41:13.52 --> 04:41:15.52
He's dead, but you didn't come to himself.

4182
04:41:15.52 --> 04:41:16.52
This is dead.

4183
04:41:16.52 --> 04:41:17.52
That's a great example of you.

4184
04:41:17.52 --> 04:41:18.52
That is the bottom bitch.

4185
04:41:18.52 --> 04:41:22.52
You know, you saw that girl. She was not just, you know, keeping these girls.

4186
04:41:22.52 --> 04:41:27.52
She was training them how to perform these acts for these people as these young girls.

4187
04:41:27.52 --> 04:41:32.52
It is just, it is a horrible world, horrible.

4188
04:41:32.52 --> 04:41:39.52
Yeah, and, and in this particular case that you're talking about, you and your team, you guys are all

4189
04:41:39.52 --> 04:41:45.52
just in your ass to try and put together these freaking targeted packages and you're going to like bust a bunch of these people and you get shot now.

4190
04:41:45.52 --> 04:41:57.52
Yeah, for political reasons, donation money, whatever the motivations were ultimately, we put together, I mean, black and white, close case.

4191
04:41:57.52 --> 04:41:58.52
Here you go.

4192
04:41:58.52 --> 04:42:03.52
This guy, here's a video of him buying this girl in exchange for services.

4193
04:42:03.52 --> 04:42:07.52
You know, he took money, paid this person, and in exchange he got this thing.

4194
04:42:07.52 --> 04:42:11.52
Here's the video of it. Here's the pictures of it. Here's his phone number. Here's the text communications.

4195
04:42:11.52 --> 04:42:12.52
Here's everything.

4196
04:42:12.52 --> 04:42:15.52
And, uh, not a girl.

4197
04:42:17.52 --> 04:42:20.52
The evil is well-connected.

4198
04:42:20.52 --> 04:42:21.52
Yes, they are.

4199
04:42:21.52 --> 04:42:31.52
Yeah, you know, if you're able to trade in one human pain, one human suffering of drugs, you'll do it with people.

4200
04:42:31.52 --> 04:42:34.52
If you're going to do it with drugs and people, you're going to do it with guns.

4201
04:42:34.52 --> 04:42:42.52
If you're going to do it, guns, drugs and people, you're going to do it with young people, you know, you're, you're lying just becomes product.

4202
04:42:42.52 --> 04:42:48.52
Yeah, yeah, you kind of talked about it here. Like if you're willing to be a drug dealer, then it's just like what else.

4203
04:42:48.52 --> 04:42:50.52
Yeah, you're just going to do it all.

4204
04:42:50.52 --> 04:43:00.52
Um, that whole thing doesn't seem to, I mean, it affects you, it impacts you, but like you seem to get more determined.

4205
04:43:00.52 --> 04:43:07.52
And is, is it safe to say that sheep dog response is like a response to that and a bug.

4206
04:43:07.52 --> 04:43:16.52
I mean, obviously, there are other things, but it seemed like from the book, people learning how to take care of themselves is incredibly important.

4207
04:43:16.52 --> 04:43:21.52
Especially when you know, you can't take care of everyone.

4208
04:43:21.52 --> 04:43:24.52
I mean, I had this conversation with my, especially with my daughters.

4209
04:43:24.52 --> 04:43:28.52
Like when they were young, hey, I'm not going to be with you.

4210
04:43:28.52 --> 04:43:32.52
Yeah, I am not going to be with you. And if you don't know how to handle yourself,

4211
04:43:32.52 --> 04:43:34.52
the bad things are going to happen to you.

4212
04:43:34.52 --> 04:43:39.52
You created this awesome program, sheep dog response. Talk as, talk to us about that.

4213
04:43:39.52 --> 04:43:47.52
The, um, I'm starting to get my traction now. Like things are starting to make sense is how, how can I impact change?

4214
04:43:47.52 --> 04:43:50.52
How can I really start making a different, making a difference?

4215
04:43:50.52 --> 04:43:54.52
And, um, you know, like, well, I can't be in every hotel motel.

4216
04:43:54.52 --> 04:44:01.52
I can't be in every super bowl. Why can't be in every movie theater back to the soft model of, you know, we are forced multipliers.

4217
04:44:01.52 --> 04:44:06.52
You can, you can take 12 special forces guys. You drop them into a country.

4218
04:44:06.52 --> 04:44:08.52
And they're going to train a company of peace.

4219
04:44:08.52 --> 04:44:15.52
You know, so like you're, you're going to have 12 hundred people in six months from now that are all fighting alongside these green berets.

4220
04:44:15.52 --> 04:44:22.52
That's 1212 because you're going to also have to deal with the 12 ODA guys that now each have a hundred due to work in form.

4221
04:44:22.52 --> 04:44:27.52
That's the soft model. So I come back and I'm just like, okay, I know what to do.

4222
04:44:27.52 --> 04:44:32.52
No tears already showed me how to do it. I'm just going to buy it with and through start training people.

4223
04:44:32.52 --> 04:44:36.52
Americans about what it means to be individual or responsible.

4224
04:44:36.52 --> 04:44:39.52
What does it mean to have to provide for your own security?

4225
04:44:39.52 --> 04:44:43.52
Like if you really believe that no help is coming, I know that first hand that no help is going to come.

4226
04:44:43.52 --> 04:44:45.52
Like you have to be able to do it yourself.

4227
04:44:45.52 --> 04:44:51.52
Um, if I can make community stronger, if I can have somebody sitting in a movie theater and so, you know, in a war

4228
04:44:51.52 --> 04:44:56.52
for the next dude that's, well, at the debut of the next Batman movie that comes into hurt somebody.

4229
04:44:56.52 --> 04:44:59.52
And then there's just this one dude that's like, about today.

4230
04:44:59.52 --> 04:45:02.52
Yeah, you kidding me? Just puts that dude in the dirt.

4231
04:45:02.52 --> 04:45:04.52
Caves in skull.

4232
04:45:04.52 --> 04:45:07.52
Stories over. You know, like no headline news, no anything.

4233
04:45:07.52 --> 04:45:12.52
So you know, we're running a couple hundred courses a year now.

4234
04:45:12.52 --> 04:45:22.52
Uh, sold out that, uh, in response to not just this, but also seeing the actors shooters, the bombings and Boston.

4235
04:45:22.52 --> 04:45:30.52
Um, we, we have to get our teeth back. You know, you don't, you don't look, you don't look at a flock that's being attacked and be like, do you want it?

4236
04:45:30.52 --> 04:45:32.52
We should take all the teeth out of this sheep.

4237
04:45:32.52 --> 04:45:33.52
That's good plan.

4238
04:45:33.52 --> 04:45:38.52
Like that's just do anything, right? You know, I'm a dude walking around. There's rapes happening all the, all over.

4239
04:45:38.52 --> 04:45:50.52
You know, I should just cut my dick off. You know, that's not going to change anything. The only way that we're going to really start impacting change is to have, well, these wolves are walking around and then they're cool.

4240
04:45:50.52 --> 04:45:56.52
Is that another jokker willing? You know, nope. That's just another American that got on the jokker program.

4241
04:45:56.52 --> 04:45:59.52
That's what it is. That's another dude that started training you did, too.

4242
04:45:59.52 --> 04:46:01.52
That's another woman that learned how to shoot.

4243
04:46:01.52 --> 04:46:05.52
That's, that's another former traffic victim. That's like, nope, I fought my way free.

4244
04:46:05.52 --> 04:46:15.52
I'm healthy now and I have a whole bunch of them. Every single one of our courses, we have dedicated spots to gold star members and anybody that has ever been assaulted, sexually assaulted.

4245
04:46:15.52 --> 04:46:30.52
And we sponsor people all the time and these women are fierce. They are passionate and I would never want to be on the receiving end of trying to hurt one of these women again because they will find a space and put a knife in between your ribs. They're awesome.

4246
04:46:30.52 --> 04:46:39.52
So that's what she's done with response. It's trying to the onus of protecting and providing for your family is on you. Nobody else is going to do it. It's on you.

4247
04:46:39.52 --> 04:46:53.52
So I am poaching, you know, like mass myth or director training army green bra, special forces guy coming from special missions unit, Carl Kringol Kringol RCO. He's a Navy Special Warfare guy.

4248
04:46:53.52 --> 04:47:10.52
He's going down the list in the hallways and you're like, cool, a marsach dude, another green bra, another Navy dude. And I could just every single one of these absolute hammers that are servants to just Americans that want to learn how to be better prepared for whatever's next.

4249
04:47:10.52 --> 04:47:19.52
The statement that no one else is coming is it might sound if you're just listening to this if you don't know anything or whatever.

4250
04:47:19.52 --> 04:47:29.52
It's not really negative. Like no one cares about you or whatever. The fact of the matter is it's just impossible to police up the world.

4251
04:47:29.52 --> 04:47:42.52
And even in the best case scenario, if you have the time to dial 911 or make a call for help, the best response times in the world is too late.

4252
04:47:42.52 --> 04:47:52.52
And here's the other thing. You know, we talked earlier about you just to be in a superpower, which it most certainly is.

4253
04:47:52.52 --> 04:48:09.52
There's aspects of being aware and aspects of knowing how to respond immediately to something that are also and aspects of firearms that are also a superpower.

4254
04:48:09.52 --> 04:48:14.52
And by that I mean, someone that has trained.

4255
04:48:14.52 --> 04:48:22.52
Look, you should train all the time in if you're if you're going to carry what you should you should train all the time to know.

4256
04:48:22.52 --> 04:48:33.52
But even after a basic course where you get a little bit of stress test, you understand your weapon system, you understand how to utilize it.

4257
04:48:33.52 --> 04:48:42.52
That's a freaking superpower. And you can you can protect yourself. You can protect your family and you should have that capability as a human being.

4258
04:48:42.52 --> 04:48:58.52
So this is like to me what you're doing with this is just like a it's just the beginning of people becoming aware and like you said, this force multiplier where when something happens out in the world.

4259
04:48:58.52 --> 04:49:08.52
I think in three years, five years, it's just like, you know, how good as a hijacker going to do on an airplane right now trying to take all of an airplane.

4260
04:49:08.52 --> 04:49:20.52
Like it ain't happens. That's where we can get to in America where it's like, oh, this stuff we're not, no, it's not happening. No, it's not happening. You're not doing that not today.

4261
04:49:20.52 --> 04:49:26.52
Not in this movie theater, not in this school, not in this grocery store. It's not happening.

4262
04:49:26.52 --> 04:49:36.52
And do I wish that the world was just filled with benevolent people and we didn't have to think like this? Sure. Of course. Of course. Yes.

4263
04:49:36.52 --> 04:49:40.52
I think that way, but it's not. It's not that it never will be.

4264
04:49:40.52 --> 04:49:49.52
It never has been like this isn't a new problem. You know, this goes back to the beginning of recorded history where evil people exist and evil people are going to do terrible things.

4265
04:49:49.52 --> 04:49:59.52
And when you are calling for help and help is minutes away, you're the end of your life as seconds away. He just don't have enough time. It is on you to do this.

4266
04:49:59.52 --> 04:50:11.52
And I don't, and I say this because you don't know what this is. It might be medical. You know, it might be a response to a disease that would never seem before that's killing lots of people. Like, oh, cool, you're, you're out of shape, you're super fat.

4267
04:50:11.52 --> 04:50:21.52
You haven't been exercising. You are very susceptible to this. Well, you want the bet. I was never worried about it because I'm, nor was I worried about my family because we're all young, healthy and shape.

4268
04:50:21.52 --> 04:50:27.52
And, and insert whatever this is, and we don't know what the next this is going to be.

4269
04:50:27.52 --> 04:50:39.52
But you better be prepared for it. And the only way you prepare for something is to start training. One of the soft truths is that you can never prepare for a bad event after the bad event happens.

4270
04:50:39.52 --> 04:50:49.52
You have to prepare for it ahead of time. So start preparing. Yeah. And I've talked about this before with, like, you know what you're just, or was shooting.

4271
04:50:49.52 --> 04:50:59.52
Like, hey, what if you, what if you spend a, invest a bunch of time in GJJJ and you've invested a bunch of time in shooting and you never get in a fight and you never have to use your weapon.

4272
04:50:59.52 --> 04:51:14.52
Okay. First of all, that's great that you never had to get a fight and it's great that you never have to use your weapon. But also, you're going to be just be a better person because when you're, when you're doing GJJJJ, you're getting good shape you're having camaraderie, you're, getting a cardio workout, you're working on your flex.

4273
04:51:14.52 --> 04:51:26.52
Well, this is a million other benefits with shooting. Oh, you work on your hand eye coordination, you get the, you get the learn how to focus on things. You get to learn how to read, know how to extractions, like there's a bunch of really cool things that happen regardless.

4274
04:51:26.52 --> 04:51:27.52
this.

4275
04:51:27.52 --> 04:51:28.52
So these are just good.

4276
04:51:28.52 --> 04:51:32.36
And I would even argue that a bad thing didn't happen because you were training these

4277
04:51:32.36 --> 04:51:33.36
other things.

4278
04:51:33.36 --> 04:51:36.60
And that's a real difficult thing to quantify.

4279
04:51:36.60 --> 04:51:39.88
But when you look the bad things that happen around people that are trained are less

4280
04:51:39.88 --> 04:51:42.56
frequent than people that are around untrained.

4281
04:51:42.56 --> 04:51:44.56
And like why does this happen?

4282
04:51:44.56 --> 04:51:47.60
Well, because we don't put ourselves in those positions, because we condition our mind

4283
04:51:47.60 --> 04:51:52.64
and our body to be in great places, to not go into the dark parking lots.

4284
04:51:52.64 --> 04:51:55.32
So we start watching videos to be better.

4285
04:51:55.32 --> 04:51:58.36
And as I'm watching this video, I was like, oh, I don't want to be walking down

4286
04:51:58.36 --> 04:52:00.56
a dark alley in the middle of the night by myself.

4287
04:52:00.56 --> 04:52:01.56
I will avoid that.

4288
04:52:01.56 --> 04:52:03.56
You know, it's a good thing I learned this.

4289
04:52:03.56 --> 04:52:04.56
Yeah.

4290
04:52:04.56 --> 04:52:05.56
Kids.

4291
04:52:05.56 --> 04:52:08.56
I love them.

4292
04:52:08.56 --> 04:52:13.56
And when you start talking about Jiu Jitsu and I just got asked this question every

4293
04:52:13.56 --> 04:52:17.32
day by a kid, it's like, oh, do I have to do Jiu to if I don't like to fight?

4294
04:52:17.32 --> 04:52:19.20
And I was like, you know what?

4295
04:52:19.20 --> 04:52:23.56
If you don't like to fight, that's even more of a reason to do Jiu Jitsu.

4296
04:52:23.56 --> 04:52:26.68
Because if you know Jiu Jitsu, you probably won't have to fight.

4297
04:52:26.68 --> 04:52:29.76
Because your whole attitude is different.

4298
04:52:29.76 --> 04:52:31.68
And now you got this thing called the Apagee.

4299
04:52:31.68 --> 04:52:32.68
Is that right, Apagee?

4300
04:52:32.68 --> 04:52:33.68
Apagee?

4301
04:52:33.68 --> 04:52:34.68
Apagee.

4302
04:52:34.68 --> 04:52:35.68
Cedar Park.

4303
04:52:35.68 --> 04:52:38.52
School for kids or your kids, if I can say that.

4304
04:52:38.52 --> 04:52:39.52
You can't.

4305
04:52:39.52 --> 04:52:40.52
Yeah.

4306
04:52:40.52 --> 04:52:41.52
Got your book on the shelves.

4307
04:52:41.52 --> 04:52:42.52
They really do.

4308
04:52:42.52 --> 04:52:43.52
Yeah.

4309
04:52:43.52 --> 04:52:45.52
Awesome.

4310
04:52:45.52 --> 04:52:46.52
That's how many.

4311
04:52:46.52 --> 04:52:47.92
So you start this September, right?

4312
04:52:47.92 --> 04:52:48.92
You're kicking that off.

4313
04:52:48.92 --> 04:52:50.72
We started, we were one year in.

4314
04:52:50.72 --> 04:52:52.12
Your two starts to September.

4315
04:52:52.12 --> 04:52:54.84
Oh, I just, on this podcast, you and me.

4316
04:52:54.84 --> 04:52:55.84
Yeah, we talked about it.

4317
04:52:55.84 --> 04:52:56.84
And I was like, I'm done.

4318
04:52:56.84 --> 04:52:58.84
I'm starting my own school.

4319
04:52:58.84 --> 04:53:03.40
Like that realization happened while you just like this, where face to face four years

4320
04:53:03.40 --> 04:53:05.20
later, we launched the school.

4321
04:53:05.20 --> 04:53:07.60
We launched two branches of it.

4322
04:53:07.60 --> 04:53:09.16
One is Apagee Strong.

4323
04:53:09.16 --> 04:53:11.64
That is an online mentorship for young men.

4324
04:53:11.64 --> 04:53:15.16
That is how to be a provider, a protector.

4325
04:53:15.16 --> 04:53:20.32
You know, you are the lone security member of your family 13 years to 30 years.

4326
04:53:20.32 --> 04:53:24.40
We have 30 year old men that are in this young men mentorship program.

4327
04:53:24.40 --> 04:53:30.04
I'm tip in my hat to them because it's a cool thing to be a pseudo grown man.

4328
04:53:30.04 --> 04:53:32.76
But then realize, I don't know how to change my oil.

4329
04:53:32.76 --> 04:53:35.24
I don't know how to, you know, I've never read Jocca's book.

4330
04:53:35.24 --> 04:53:37.92
Your book is on a reading list.

4331
04:53:37.92 --> 04:53:41.60
And so that is one is the young men mentorship program.

4332
04:53:41.60 --> 04:53:46.04
And then the other one is our physical school in Austin, Texas.

4333
04:53:46.04 --> 04:53:48.04
That's Apagee Cedar Park.

4334
04:53:48.04 --> 04:53:53.84
You know, 100 hero school, bunch of just rad-secretic learners.

4335
04:53:53.84 --> 04:54:00.44
And we are your one and the books in what days of the day?

4336
04:54:00.44 --> 04:54:01.44
It's 28, 20 years.

4337
04:54:01.44 --> 04:54:02.84
Yeah, with two days.

4338
04:54:02.84 --> 04:54:05.20
It's the end of the school session.

4339
04:54:05.20 --> 04:54:07.84
And your one is in the books getting ready for year two.

4340
04:54:07.84 --> 04:54:11.04
Michelle Myers is our new director of program.

4341
04:54:11.04 --> 04:54:12.04
She's amazing.

4342
04:54:12.04 --> 04:54:13.04
I'm just so proud.

4343
04:54:13.04 --> 04:54:14.04
It's amazing.

4344
04:54:14.04 --> 04:54:18.04
In every corner, you just see magic happening.

4345
04:54:18.04 --> 04:54:23.68
You see, so our students are heroes, the learners in the school.

4346
04:54:23.68 --> 04:54:25.28
They're in charge of everything.

4347
04:54:25.28 --> 04:54:27.76
So they figure out their day, their schedule.

4348
04:54:27.76 --> 04:54:30.16
We have these launches where everybody get together.

4349
04:54:30.16 --> 04:54:36.64
And if we're focusing on math, maybe we're talking about how to measure to put extra

4350
04:54:36.64 --> 04:54:38.56
sod out in our place gap.

4351
04:54:38.56 --> 04:54:40.04
How do we figure out area?

4352
04:54:40.04 --> 04:54:42.04
And then they're off.

4353
04:54:42.04 --> 04:54:47.000
They're doing their research, their guide is in there saying, maybe try this formula.

4354
04:54:47.000 --> 04:54:49.84
Have you thought about researching this way?

4355
04:54:49.84 --> 04:54:54.48
But every day, these kids are making all of their own decisions.

4356
04:54:54.48 --> 04:54:58.72
Unlike in school, whether Lemines is just going to where they're told or somebody's

4357
04:54:58.72 --> 04:54:59.72
lecturing them.

4358
04:54:59.72 --> 04:55:01.44
Instead, they're doing everything.

4359
04:55:01.44 --> 04:55:03.36
They're sitting there like, this is what time I'm going to get here.

4360
04:55:03.36 --> 04:55:06.16
This is what time I'm going to do my homework.

4361
04:55:06.16 --> 04:55:08.36
This is the program that I'm going to use.

4362
04:55:08.36 --> 04:55:10.72
I have a question.

4363
04:55:10.72 --> 04:55:11.72
How do I do this?

4364
04:55:11.72 --> 04:55:13.64
And the guy's like, oh, I'm actually not going to tell you.

4365
04:55:13.64 --> 04:55:17.88
I'm going to ask you a different question for you to figure out yourself.

4366
04:55:17.88 --> 04:55:19.40
So our guides provide no answers.

4367
04:55:19.40 --> 04:55:21.36
We just ask more questions.

4368
04:55:21.36 --> 04:55:23.36
Totally, it's so crowded.

4369
04:55:23.36 --> 04:55:26.60
A lot of times people ask me, how do you get people to take ownership?

4370
04:55:26.60 --> 04:55:28.60
I might say you have to give them ownership.

4371
04:55:28.60 --> 04:55:29.60
Yes, you do.

4372
04:55:29.60 --> 04:55:30.60
You have to give them ownership.

4373
04:55:30.60 --> 04:55:31.60
It's so hard, though.

4374
04:55:31.60 --> 04:55:32.60
Yeah.

4375
04:55:32.60 --> 04:55:38.32
It's easier than just give them ownership to take the reins and just release somebody up.

4376
04:55:38.32 --> 04:55:43.16
You have to have faith that the process, because they're going to fail, is a parent

4377
04:55:43.16 --> 04:55:48.72
okay with their child failing.

4378
04:55:48.72 --> 04:55:50.88
I'm not going to give you a grade this year.

4379
04:55:50.88 --> 04:55:56.84
The parents like, well, I want to stick her that shows that Tommy is a straight-a student.

4380
04:55:56.84 --> 04:56:02.12
If you don't get that, you know, they're going to be learning at their own pace to different

4381
04:56:02.12 --> 04:56:03.12
things.

4382
04:56:03.12 --> 04:56:08.000
Yeah, and when you give the kids the ownership, they're so much more engaged.

4383
04:56:08.000 --> 04:56:11.44
You know, instead of just, hey, here's the task you've got to do today, Timmy.

4384
04:56:11.44 --> 04:56:13.84
Like you do this this and this, you're like, oh, whatever.

4385
04:56:13.84 --> 04:56:16.64
But I say, hey, Tim, how do you want to do this?

4386
04:56:16.64 --> 04:56:17.80
What do you think you need to get out of this?

4387
04:56:17.80 --> 04:56:22.64
And all of a sudden, you have ownership, and now you're engaged, which is freaking as

4388
04:56:22.64 --> 04:56:25.36
it should be.

4389
04:56:25.36 --> 04:56:26.36
So there you are.

4390
04:56:26.36 --> 04:56:35.000
You got the school going, you got the sheep dog response, everything's rocking and rolling.

4391
04:56:35.000 --> 04:56:42.000
And all of a sudden, Afghanistan falls apart.

4392
04:56:42.000 --> 04:56:47.88
You're talking a neck on the phone.

4393
04:56:47.88 --> 04:56:52.28
I'm going to go to the book for this.

4394
04:56:52.28 --> 04:56:54.32
What a fucking shit show, man.

4395
04:56:54.32 --> 04:56:58.88
He says, referring to our government's performance so far while shaking his head and

4396
04:56:58.88 --> 04:57:00.44
discussed.

4397
04:57:00.44 --> 04:57:06.24
It's an idealist.

4398
04:57:06.24 --> 04:57:10.20
He still gets genuinely surprised when people fail as bad leaders.

4399
04:57:10.20 --> 04:57:11.72
We are failing on this mission right now.

4400
04:57:11.72 --> 04:57:13.88
How do we pull out all of our forces and then try and evacuate?

4401
04:57:13.88 --> 04:57:15.000
He isn't really talking to me.

4402
04:57:15.000 --> 04:57:16.16
He's just venting.

4403
04:57:16.16 --> 04:57:20.000
He and I have had this conversation about a thousand times in the past 48 hours.

4404
04:57:20.000 --> 04:57:23.08
We sit by our coffee and silence for a little while.

4405
04:57:23.08 --> 04:57:27.40
Him wrestling with being let down by America, me wrestling with a conversation I had earlier

4406
04:57:27.40 --> 04:57:31.72
today with Chad Robashall.

4407
04:57:31.72 --> 04:57:35.88
Chad was a rangered up sponsored MMA fighter who fought and strived for us at the same

4408
04:57:35.88 --> 04:57:36.88
time.

4409
04:57:36.88 --> 04:57:37.88
I did.

4410
04:57:37.88 --> 04:57:42.12
A lifetime ago, he was a force recon Marine who was then assigned J. Sock and deployed

4411
04:57:42.12 --> 04:57:44.12
multiple times to Afghanistan.

4412
04:57:44.12 --> 04:57:49.12
Now he runs successful nonprofit called the mighty Oaks Foundation, which helps veterans

4413
04:57:49.12 --> 04:57:52.76
find resilience in all aspects of their lives.

4414
04:57:52.76 --> 04:57:57.36
I personally attended one of their resiliency programs and it was life changing.

4415
04:57:57.36 --> 04:58:01.08
Chad is a good friend and he has a problem.

4416
04:58:01.08 --> 04:58:08.28
His interpreter, Aziz, is trapped and is actively being hunted because of who Aziz is and

4417
04:58:08.28 --> 04:58:09.52
who he helped.

4418
04:58:09.52 --> 04:58:15.52
If he is caught, they will rape and murder his wife and children while he watches, then

4419
04:58:15.52 --> 04:58:19.36
they will kill him.

4420
04:58:19.36 --> 04:58:24.04
Chad isn't looking to send messages to Kabul like everyone else.

4421
04:58:24.04 --> 04:58:29.52
He has been working with his old J. Sock buddy, Santa 6, who now does contracting work

4422
04:58:29.52 --> 04:58:33.96
in that region, putting a plan in motion to get Aziz out.

4423
04:58:33.96 --> 04:58:38.24
Unfortunately, their timeline just got blown because no one expected the entire country

4424
04:58:38.24 --> 04:58:41.28
to fall to the Taliban in a week.

4425
04:58:41.28 --> 04:58:46.60
Chad wants to know if I will go with him to Afghanistan via the United Arab Emirates.

4426
04:58:46.60 --> 04:58:51.96
Apparently, Santa 6 rides motorcycles with another former force recon Marine that has some

4427
04:58:51.96 --> 04:58:58.12
kind of connection to the UAE and they might let us use a plane to get it into Afghanistan.

4428
04:58:58.12 --> 04:59:03.72
This already feels like six degrees of Kevin Bankon and I'm nervous at the friend of a friend

4429
04:59:03.72 --> 04:59:06.36
structure we discussed.

4430
04:59:06.36 --> 04:59:07.36
Is there a plan?

4431
04:59:07.36 --> 04:59:09.96
I asked him when we were on the phone earlier.

4432
04:59:09.96 --> 04:59:15.16
If we're going to go do some crazy shit, I need to know that we're doing this to make

4433
04:59:15.16 --> 04:59:18.20
a difference and not just go.

4434
04:59:18.20 --> 04:59:23.72
As I'm thinking about this, Nick gets lost in his phone for a minute and I see that

4435
04:59:23.72 --> 04:59:26.72
I have another text message from Chad.

4436
04:59:26.72 --> 04:59:29.44
He's heading to UAE in 48 hours.

4437
04:59:29.44 --> 04:59:33.48
The only thing he's waiting for is his COVID test to come back so he can travel.

4438
04:59:33.48 --> 04:59:35.60
He wants me to go.

4439
04:59:35.60 --> 04:59:37.72
I'm with Nick right now working on the book.

4440
04:59:37.72 --> 04:59:39.48
I text him.

4441
04:59:39.48 --> 04:59:40.64
Awesome.

4442
04:59:40.64 --> 04:59:42.76
Bring him to we could use him.

4443
04:59:42.76 --> 04:59:47.12
He answers.

4444
04:59:47.12 --> 04:59:53.36
So it's on.

4445
04:59:53.36 --> 04:59:59.88
At that moment, people falling from land in landy gear have Afghanistan.

4446
04:59:59.88 --> 05:00:03.44
That's what's happening right here at this moment.

4447
05:00:03.44 --> 05:00:11.08
My phone was just our entire world, our men that aren't used to being helpless.

4448
05:00:11.08 --> 05:00:14.32
There's something that we can always do.

4449
05:00:14.32 --> 05:00:17.28
We felt as a collective helpless.

4450
05:00:17.28 --> 05:00:20.64
We didn't know what to do.

4451
05:00:20.64 --> 05:00:23.96
That was not something, I mean, that's the reason I started shooting out response.

4452
05:00:23.96 --> 05:00:26.80
Obviously, that's the reason that we started to save our allies.

4453
05:00:26.80 --> 05:00:28.56
This answered a helplessness.

4454
05:00:28.56 --> 05:00:32.80
I'm just not going to ever accept that I don't have an answer.

4455
05:00:32.80 --> 05:00:34.80
That I am helpless.

4456
05:00:34.80 --> 05:00:39.92
In just accepting that is a form of quitting.

4457
05:00:39.92 --> 05:00:42.12
I'm not down with that.

4458
05:00:42.12 --> 05:00:50.56
So we didn't know what to do yet, but we had to do something.

4459
05:00:50.56 --> 05:00:59.48
So you, Nick, Chad, a woman named Sarah Virardo, I'm saying that right.

4460
05:00:59.48 --> 05:01:02.20
She seems like just an incredibly awesome human.

4461
05:01:02.20 --> 05:01:06.36
She's the CEO of something called the Independence Fund.

4462
05:01:06.36 --> 05:01:08.88
Her husband was wounded bad.

4463
05:01:08.88 --> 05:01:13.96
This Independence Fund, it helps with all kinds of stuff.

4464
05:01:13.96 --> 05:01:20.56
Wounded vets with mobility, with caregivers, with advocacy, with case work, with resiliency,

4465
05:01:20.56 --> 05:01:24.84
family programs, like just doing a lot of great stuff.

4466
05:01:24.84 --> 05:01:27.12
The Independence Fund.

4467
05:01:27.12 --> 05:01:33.20
She also has good connections because she's been very effective.

4468
05:01:33.20 --> 05:01:36.96
She's involved as well because she's got some good political connections of people that

4469
05:01:36.96 --> 05:01:37.96
can help out.

4470
05:01:37.96 --> 05:01:43.48
As a end up, planes trains an automobile to get to UAE.

4471
05:01:43.48 --> 05:01:50.48
You get, and again, the detail, get the book so you can read this story.

4472
05:01:50.48 --> 05:01:52.88
You end up getting to UAE.

4473
05:01:52.88 --> 05:01:57.20
It's like even getting into UAE, you've got to get, you've got to call people in Congress,

4474
05:01:57.20 --> 05:02:03.08
you've got to get phone calls or made, things are happening.

4475
05:02:03.08 --> 05:02:11.08
You end up with a C-17 that's going to help you get people out of Afghanistan.

4476
05:02:11.08 --> 05:02:13.24
That had to be an interesting flight.

4477
05:02:13.24 --> 05:02:15.80
You're in an empty C-17.

4478
05:02:15.80 --> 05:02:16.80
You're in an empty C-17.

4479
05:02:16.80 --> 05:02:17.80
You're in an empty C-17.

4480
05:02:17.80 --> 05:02:18.80
You're in an empty C-17.

4481
05:02:18.80 --> 05:02:26.44
We also chartered slash bought an Afghan airline.

4482
05:02:26.44 --> 05:02:31.96
The C-17 has just landed and is unloading.

4483
05:02:31.96 --> 05:02:40.52
We're taking a 737 from UAE into Afghanistan while they're prepping the UAE said,

4484
05:02:40.52 --> 05:02:46.52
okay, if you can take a C-17, fill it up with perfect, a perfect roster of people.

4485
05:02:46.52 --> 05:02:51.08
You have a manifest of, if we made one mistake, they're going to cut us off.

4486
05:02:51.08 --> 05:02:54.28
We put one bad dude on a plane, we're out.

4487
05:02:54.28 --> 05:03:01.92
We were being the degrees of verifying who is on our list was very arduous.

4488
05:03:01.92 --> 05:03:07.44
So after we fill that first plane out, they're like, okay, well, you can do more.

4489
05:03:07.44 --> 05:03:08.84
Let's empty this one.

4490
05:03:08.84 --> 05:03:13.24
And like, well, can we also just use this air strip if we have other planes?

4491
05:03:13.24 --> 05:03:15.04
And then it said, yeah.

4492
05:03:15.04 --> 05:03:24.96
So then we started this revolving door of aircraft of using the UAE C-17s and a fleet of 737s.

4493
05:03:24.96 --> 05:03:32.64
All plugs, we're pulling every, we're throwing flags in every single window at this point.

4494
05:03:32.64 --> 05:03:36.44
We are full on, we gave zero shits.

4495
05:03:36.44 --> 05:03:39.08
We're going to make this happen and we're going to make it work.

4496
05:03:39.08 --> 05:03:45.96
Because, you know, this is, this is August 18.

4497
05:03:45.96 --> 05:03:49.52
We know two weeks, we got two weeks.

4498
05:03:49.52 --> 05:03:56.52
So wherever we get out in two weeks is going to get out, whoever doesn't is going to die,

4499
05:03:56.52 --> 05:03:57.52
period.

4500
05:03:57.52 --> 05:04:01.12
So there's, we'll, we'll deal with consequences of, you know, breaking international laws

4501
05:04:01.12 --> 05:04:03.52
or however the FAA is going to become an atta.

4502
05:04:03.52 --> 05:04:11.52
We'll, we'll deal with that later, but right now we're going to save life.

4503
05:04:11.52 --> 05:04:13.32
Eventually you get on the ground.

4504
05:04:13.32 --> 05:04:15.52
You get on the ground in Afghanistan.

4505
05:04:15.52 --> 05:04:22.52
You got like, what is it? Sean G, some dude named C spray.

4506
05:04:22.52 --> 05:04:25.52
And you, you guys, the guy's four of us and who's the other one?

4507
05:04:25.52 --> 05:04:26.52
And Dave.

4508
05:04:26.52 --> 05:04:27.52
Okay.

4509
05:04:27.52 --> 05:04:35.52
So it's you four that are going to basically go outside the wire and link up with the, the people

4510
05:04:35.52 --> 05:04:39.52
that you're looking for, which you have a legit manifest of people that you got to gather

4511
05:04:39.52 --> 05:04:41.52
up.

4512
05:04:41.52 --> 05:04:47.52
So the thing is Nick is on base helping out coordinating, decinflicting all that other shit,

4513
05:04:47.52 --> 05:04:51.52
a bunch of other guys, what's a total number of guys on the team, a dozen guys or something like that.

4514
05:04:51.52 --> 05:04:52.52
12 guys.

4515
05:04:52.52 --> 05:05:00.52
So in DC, Sarah Varado sets up like this talk and every name, I know everybody remembers

4516
05:05:00.52 --> 05:05:03.52
signal and WhatsApp and emails.

4517
05:05:03.52 --> 05:05:05.52
Hey, I got this guy who's my turp.

4518
05:05:05.52 --> 05:05:06.52
Here's his paperwork.

4519
05:05:06.52 --> 05:05:08.52
He's currently an SIV applicant.

4520
05:05:08.52 --> 05:05:11.52
He's here's letters from the commander that he was working with.

4521
05:05:11.52 --> 05:05:14.52
A lot of hundreds and thousands of them, right?

4522
05:05:14.52 --> 05:05:16.52
Like the phones were just melting down.

4523
05:05:16.52 --> 05:05:19.52
Sarah would burn through her phone like nine times in a day.

4524
05:05:19.52 --> 05:05:22.52
And so she is co-located.

4525
05:05:22.52 --> 05:05:26.52
I'm not going to say who in the government she's with, but our manifest is going through department

4526
05:05:26.52 --> 05:05:27.52
of state and DOD.

4527
05:05:27.52 --> 05:05:32.52
At the same time, every single name that comes in, we take that name, we create a packet around that name.

4528
05:05:32.52 --> 05:05:34.52
Here's all of their digital documents.

4529
05:05:34.52 --> 05:05:38.52
And like here's here's their PID and here's that they're good to go.

4530
05:05:38.52 --> 05:05:40.52
Once they're good to go, that gets forward to UAE.

4531
05:05:40.52 --> 05:05:46.52
In UAE, we had eight people that were working in our forward operating base.

4532
05:05:46.52 --> 05:05:49.52
And then there's the four of us on the ground in Afghanistan.

4533
05:05:49.52 --> 05:05:53.52
Dave was staying on the base and then the three of us, Sean G,

4534
05:05:53.52 --> 05:05:57.52
see spray in myself, we're going out into Kabul to grab these people to conduct

4535
05:05:57.52 --> 05:05:59.52
wakeups to bring them back onto H.K.

4536
05:05:59.52 --> 05:06:01.52
When did this become save our allies?

4537
05:06:01.52 --> 05:06:02.52
This is save our allies, right?

4538
05:06:02.52 --> 05:06:03.52
That's right.

4539
05:06:03.52 --> 05:06:05.52
When did it become save our allies?

4540
05:06:05.52 --> 05:06:07.52
At some point you had to put a name on it.

4541
05:06:07.52 --> 05:06:09.52
We had to put a name on it.

4542
05:06:09.52 --> 05:06:14.52
The only reason I say that right now is just if people want to help out,

4543
05:06:14.52 --> 05:06:18.52
because I know you're still doing work, is it what save our allies.com.

4544
05:06:18.52 --> 05:06:19.52
Ork.

4545
05:06:19.52 --> 05:06:20.52
So save our allies.org.

4546
05:06:20.52 --> 05:06:24.52
We still have safe houses all around the Middle East that we've,

4547
05:06:24.52 --> 05:06:26.52
we've literally padded people out of Afghanistan.

4548
05:06:26.52 --> 05:06:30.52
We're still paying for these people until we work through the department of state immigration

4549
05:06:30.52 --> 05:06:33.52
system to get them to go to wherever.

4550
05:06:33.52 --> 05:06:36.52
Ultimately they're going to go Albania, Brazil, Colombia, the United States,

4551
05:06:36.52 --> 05:06:38.52
sometimes, but very rarely right now.

4552
05:06:38.52 --> 05:06:40.52
So, save our allies.

4553
05:06:40.52 --> 05:06:44.52
It was the founding members were Chad, me, Nick, and Sarah.

4554
05:06:44.52 --> 05:06:47.52
So from that initial phone call of, hey, we got to go get Aziz.

4555
05:06:47.52 --> 05:06:52.52
And then it was, well, there's also these a couple hundred Christian children,

4556
05:06:52.52 --> 05:06:53.52
orphans.

4557
05:06:53.52 --> 05:06:56.52
They're going to die if somebody doesn't go get them to.

4558
05:06:56.52 --> 05:06:59.52
Well, hey, we also just got a call from a senator and he has some constituents.

4559
05:06:59.52 --> 05:07:02.52
He has like six people that were on a mission strip in Afghanistan.

4560
05:07:02.52 --> 05:07:04.52
The six of them are stuck here.

4561
05:07:04.52 --> 05:07:05.52
Can you guys go get these Americans?

4562
05:07:05.52 --> 05:07:11.52
So this list went from like, I mean, just started exploding of hey can you.

4563
05:07:11.52 --> 05:07:16.52
And we could, you know, for any old call,

4564
05:07:16.52 --> 05:07:19.52
it's good men to do nothing and we could do something.

4565
05:07:19.52 --> 05:07:21.52
So what are we going to do?

4566
05:07:21.52 --> 05:07:25.52
So you're on the ground and talk us through,

4567
05:07:25.52 --> 05:07:28.52
without giving away details that might compromise like your procedure.

4568
05:07:28.52 --> 05:07:33.52
But you get information that there is a person that needs to get extracted.

4569
05:07:33.52 --> 05:07:34.52
Yep.

4570
05:07:34.52 --> 05:07:35.52
What do you do?

4571
05:07:35.52 --> 05:07:41.52
So that person has submitted to us usually by a sponsor.

4572
05:07:41.52 --> 05:07:46.52
So somebody texted you, Jaco, hey man, we were together here.

4573
05:07:46.52 --> 05:07:47.52
I'm stuck.

4574
05:07:47.52 --> 05:07:48.52
I've made it to Kabul.

4575
05:07:48.52 --> 05:07:49.52
I'm trying to get my way out.

4576
05:07:49.52 --> 05:07:53.52
So you reach out to me and say, hey, can you get this guy?

4577
05:07:53.52 --> 05:07:56.52
And I say, this is what I need from you for him to be on our manifest.

4578
05:07:56.52 --> 05:07:59.52
I need his current DOS application process.

4579
05:07:59.52 --> 05:08:02.52
Here's all the documents that are going to be required for PID.

4580
05:08:02.52 --> 05:08:05.52
Once that's done, all that goes through Sarah and DC.

4581
05:08:05.52 --> 05:08:10.52
Once that person's approved, that person comes back to me with a contact.

4582
05:08:10.52 --> 05:08:15.52
I directly go point to point with them and I start coordinating the link up.

4583
05:08:15.52 --> 05:08:18.52
I essentially have a digital packet with them.

4584
05:08:18.52 --> 05:08:21.52
And that packet has all of their digital documents.

4585
05:08:21.52 --> 05:08:25.52
And I kind of aggregate, I collective groups throughout the city.

4586
05:08:25.52 --> 05:08:28.52
So sometimes I'm meeting six people over here,

4587
05:08:28.52 --> 05:08:33.52
I'm meeting a dozen people over here or I take a truck and I push it in a Kabul.

4588
05:08:33.52 --> 05:08:34.52
And they all go to that truck.

4589
05:08:34.52 --> 05:08:37.52
And they all have to be the right place at the right time with the right information.

4590
05:08:37.52 --> 05:08:39.52
And that truck driver is going to check everything.

4591
05:08:39.52 --> 05:08:41.52
And then that guy is going to drive them to meet me.

4592
05:08:41.52 --> 05:08:45.52
So then I have a far recognition signal that they all have to know.

4593
05:08:45.52 --> 05:08:48.52
Then they come up and they give me my near recognition signal.

4594
05:08:48.52 --> 05:08:50.52
Then they have to PID their documents.

4595
05:08:50.52 --> 05:08:54.52
So the stuff that they physically have is an alignment with the digital documents that were sent.

4596
05:08:54.52 --> 05:08:59.52
And if that stuff checks out, I mean, now we're like a cipher level confirming that we have all the right people.

4597
05:08:59.52 --> 05:09:04.52
Then I have to smuggle them past the Taliban and then get them onto H.K.A.

4598
05:09:04.52 --> 05:09:09.52
Sometimes with permission of the military, sometimes without.

4599
05:09:09.52 --> 05:09:12.52
I have to get them on to base without the military.

4600
05:09:12.52 --> 05:09:14.52
What was the Taliban?

4601
05:09:14.52 --> 05:09:18.52
Was there you are you just playing clothes going out in the town?

4602
05:09:18.52 --> 05:09:18.52
Yeah.

4603
05:09:18.52 --> 05:09:20.52
What's the Taliban looking at you or are they looking at you?

4604
05:09:20.52 --> 05:09:24.52
Like, suspect, there's enough westerners that it's you're like.

4605
05:09:24.52 --> 05:09:25.52
It's a mix.

4606
05:09:25.52 --> 05:09:26.52
So we're in Kabul, right?

4607
05:09:26.52 --> 05:09:27.52
So Kabul's.

4608
05:09:27.52 --> 05:09:28.52
It's like semi-promissive environment.

4609
05:09:28.52 --> 05:09:36.52
It's capital city, but the exterior perimeter of the airport is controlled by the Taliban.

4610
05:09:36.52 --> 05:09:41.52
And whoever controls the exterior perimeter controls the ground on the inside.

4611
05:09:41.52 --> 05:09:44.52
So the Taliban set up a perimeter around the airport.

4612
05:09:44.52 --> 05:09:49.52
Every single main entrance into the airport is check pointed by the Taliban.

4613
05:09:49.52 --> 05:09:54.52
So if you are trying to get on base and you have your blue passport and you go to the Taliban,

4614
05:09:54.52 --> 05:09:58.52
the Taliban checkpoint and they're like, this is nice.

4615
05:09:58.52 --> 05:09:59.52
Thank you for this.

4616
05:09:59.52 --> 05:10:00.52
Get back out.

4617
05:10:00.52 --> 05:10:05.52
So they're now limiting who's coming in and out and they're not letting engineers plumbers.

4618
05:10:05.52 --> 05:10:14.52
You know, if you work on the sewage system, if you're a garbage man, they don't want you to leave because Kabul is going to fall and Afghanistan is going to fall without the infrastructure of the people that run it.

4619
05:10:14.52 --> 05:10:18.52
So they're the ones that are making all the decisions about who's coming on and who's coming off.

4620
05:10:18.52 --> 05:10:22.52
We were just trying to blend into the noise.

4621
05:10:22.52 --> 05:10:31.52
You know, we were trying to be, there were lots of organizations in Kabul that were working all the way up to the fall and now they're trapped too.

4622
05:10:31.52 --> 05:10:35.52
So we were just kind of looking like other trapped people.

4623
05:10:35.52 --> 05:10:38.52
You know, I wasn't walking around with body armor and being against her.

4624
05:10:38.52 --> 05:10:45.52
You know, there were times that happened, but there are also times where I was just like, you know, a little snake in the grass.

4625
05:10:45.52 --> 05:10:54.52
And what amazes me as you, as you talk about the effort that you went through to vet everyone and that was setting it up.

4626
05:10:54.52 --> 05:10:59.52
And just that one, you know, when you said, well, in Jokho, if you text me, you need this guy and here's what you got to do.

4627
05:10:59.52 --> 05:11:01.52
Bumble, bumble, bumble, bumble, bumble, bumble.

4628
05:11:01.52 --> 05:11:04.52
It's obviously a very complex hard thing to do.

4629
05:11:04.52 --> 05:11:07.52
And then you got to link up with these people in a truck or at this building or whatever.

4630
05:11:07.52 --> 05:11:14.52
And you guys did this over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

4631
05:11:14.52 --> 05:11:25.52
So the tune of 12, 12, 12, 12, 1000 people just you and your team got out of there.

4632
05:11:25.52 --> 05:11:31.52
Yeah, 10 days were on the ground for 10 days.

4633
05:11:31.52 --> 05:11:36.52
And you know, let's work, I think we're at 17,000 people now that we've moved.

4634
05:11:36.52 --> 05:11:40.52
We've moved in additional five since the fall of Afghanistan.

4635
05:11:40.52 --> 05:11:46.52
And we've got to have an extra kind of expeditionary type of efforts.

4636
05:11:46.52 --> 05:11:52.52
The government, DOD, on H.K.A., they gave us a ramp.

4637
05:11:52.52 --> 05:12:01.52
When they saw that we were being a successful as we were when, you know, Colonel Sonso or General Sonso or Senator Sonso is like, hey, I need to get this guy.

4638
05:12:01.52 --> 05:12:03.52
They're calling us because nobody else could do it.

4639
05:12:03.52 --> 05:12:05.52
Nobody could actually go into the city.

4640
05:12:05.52 --> 05:12:09.52
There were tons of organizations that rent that raised millions of dollars.

4641
05:12:09.52 --> 05:12:12.52
They still came to us to go get those people.

4642
05:12:12.52 --> 05:12:17.52
You know, some of them threw us, some of them, a lot of them didn't, a lot of them promised to throw us some money.

4643
05:12:17.52 --> 05:12:22.52
And then didn't, you know, but like we were paying for the fuel, we were paying for the aircraft.

4644
05:12:22.52 --> 05:12:27.52
We were, we were the physical dudes on the ground linking up with them and Kabul to bring them on to H.K.A.

4645
05:12:27.52 --> 05:12:35.52
And, and it is like, this is, this is unlike anything I've ever seen.

4646
05:12:35.52 --> 05:12:45.52
I mean, this is, this is, in those power vacuums, if you remember like peak ISIS, like this is what this moment is.

4647
05:12:45.52 --> 05:12:50.52
This is a complete power vacuum where American security instability evaporated.

4648
05:12:50.52 --> 05:12:57.52
And what was there no longer exists and the only thing that flows into that space and that delta is evil.

4649
05:12:57.52 --> 05:13:03.52
It is just unadulterated pure evil of what the Taliban does and did in that moment.

4650
05:13:03.52 --> 05:13:08.52
And we are trying to go into that and find these people.

4651
05:13:08.52 --> 05:13:13.52
And so we did get some degrees of approval.

4652
05:13:13.52 --> 05:13:16.52
I don't, I use approval cautiously.

4653
05:13:16.52 --> 05:13:20.52
Yeah, because the government knew who we were.

4654
05:13:20.52 --> 05:13:27.52
They like, if you walked into the base and you looked up on that, there's our ramp with our name on it and what we are doing.

4655
05:13:27.52 --> 05:13:32.52
Like we had, like we had tag numbers for our tail numbers for our aircraft and they're tracking.

4656
05:13:32.52 --> 05:13:43.52
And you know, we moved almost 11% of everybody that left that base, we moved on our aircraft.

4657
05:13:43.52 --> 05:13:56.52
That's, just a phenomenal, just a phenomenal work, phenomenal.

4658
05:13:56.52 --> 05:14:06.52
26th of August, let me go to the book.

4659
05:14:06.52 --> 05:14:10.52
The Earth shakes and the explosion echoes through the airport.

4660
05:14:10.52 --> 05:14:12.52
That was bomb.

4661
05:14:12.52 --> 05:14:15.52
Sean G. C. Spray and I look at each other.

4662
05:14:15.52 --> 05:14:18.52
We're simultaneously hoping no one got hurt.

4663
05:14:18.52 --> 05:14:22.52
And that our trip isn't coming to a premature end.

4664
05:14:22.52 --> 05:14:31.52
The internet moves at the speed of light. At the same time that some of our partners from DOD and DOS are letting us know there are casualties that abbey gate.

4665
05:14:31.52 --> 05:14:36.52
A gate we have frequented many times over the past week.

4666
05:14:36.52 --> 05:14:41.52
Nick and Santa 6 are hitting up Sean G and me asking if we're okay.

4667
05:14:41.52 --> 05:14:47.52
A suicide bomber got inside the wire and detonated killing 13 US service members.

4668
05:14:47.52 --> 05:14:51.52
All 25 years old or younger.

4669
05:14:51.52 --> 05:15:01.52
One of them I would find out later is Sergeant Nicole G, a young leader who grew up a few hours from where I did in Sacramento.

4670
05:15:01.52 --> 05:15:07.52
She helped us earlier that day when we had to search the women we rescued before bringing them on base.

4671
05:15:07.52 --> 05:15:09.52
She was really sweet and high energy.

4672
05:15:09.52 --> 05:15:14.52
She wasn't going through the motions. She greeted every Afghan with a smile.

4673
05:15:14.52 --> 05:15:19.52
She loved her job and her service.

4674
05:15:19.52 --> 05:15:23.52
This is absolutely the worst possible situation.

4675
05:15:23.52 --> 05:15:30.52
I joined the military in my early 20s. I felt old then. I felt knowledgeable. I felt like I had experienced life.

4676
05:15:30.52 --> 05:15:33.52
I had no idea.

4677
05:15:33.52 --> 05:15:44.52
These brave troops, 11 Marines, one corpsman and one soldier gave their lives to help those in need.

4678
05:15:44.52 --> 05:15:48.52
There's nothing more honorable.

4679
05:15:48.52 --> 05:15:59.52
She didn't have to come. She was, you know, they were working 12 hour shifts.

4680
05:15:59.52 --> 05:16:04.52
In that morning we were at black gate and we had pre-positioned.

4681
05:16:04.52 --> 05:16:10.52
We knew time was short and we had pre-positioned buses throughout the Kabul.

4682
05:16:10.52 --> 05:16:16.52
We were telling people the great coordinates and intersections to go to to find these buses.

4683
05:16:16.52 --> 05:16:18.52
If you go, they had a secret word.

4684
05:16:18.52 --> 05:16:20.52
They had a far recognition signal.

4685
05:16:20.52 --> 05:16:23.52
The bus driver would see, he'd wave them in.

4686
05:16:23.52 --> 05:16:26.52
Once they came up, they had to have a secret word to get onto the bus.

4687
05:16:26.52 --> 05:16:28.52
We filled these buses up.

4688
05:16:28.52 --> 05:16:34.52
We drove these buses in and ended up being a real bad situation with the base commander who didn't want to let them on.

4689
05:16:34.52 --> 05:16:36.52
He didn't always bat all aside.

4690
05:16:36.52 --> 05:16:45.52
Once we got some of these buses on, we can't touch women in the country.

4691
05:16:45.52 --> 05:16:51.52
We asked the Marines, can we have a couple of bodies to help the search these women.

4692
05:16:51.52 --> 05:16:57.52
And she, somebody hops in a car, zips down to the barracks and says, hey, we need some women.

4693
05:16:57.52 --> 05:17:01.52
Can you guys wake up? She just finished 12 hour shift.

4694
05:17:01.52 --> 05:17:04.52
She was going to start in six hours from now. She just pops up and is like, yeah.

4695
05:17:04.52 --> 05:17:07.52
This is how freaking bad ass these people are.

4696
05:17:07.52 --> 05:17:12.52
These soldiers and these Marines that were there.

4697
05:17:12.52 --> 05:17:15.52
Yes, they were in the military and yes, they were told to go there.

4698
05:17:15.52 --> 05:17:17.52
But what happens on the ground?

4699
05:17:17.52 --> 05:17:19.52
Nobody asked her to volunteer.

4700
05:17:19.52 --> 05:17:23.52
She's still the one that's like, yeah, and every one of these, she's just got shafdered.

4701
05:17:23.52 --> 05:17:29.52
X-number hours asleep. She probably has gone comitably four hours a night for that whole entire time that she's been there.

4702
05:17:29.52 --> 05:17:35.52
And her hand goes up. She comes in and she greets every one of these women and children that's coming on this base with sincerity.

4703
05:17:35.52 --> 05:17:37.52
She's just a good human.

4704
05:17:37.52 --> 05:17:47.52
You know, and then 10 hours later, she dies at Abbey Gate. A gate that I had smuggled, I crawled through sewage with children and women on my back through human shit to get through this gate.

4705
05:17:47.52 --> 05:17:52.52
And this is the gate that ISIS goes. ISIS K, I eat the Taliban to blow up.

4706
05:17:52.52 --> 05:18:07.52
Yeah, that's the 13 hour here.

4707
05:18:07.52 --> 05:18:11.52
And after that, I mean, things going to lock down.

4708
05:18:11.52 --> 05:18:14.52
Yeah.

4709
05:18:14.52 --> 05:18:20.52
That's it for you.

4710
05:18:20.52 --> 05:18:29.52
You got a couple more interesting stories in there about some other things that did take place, but eventually you end up, you got, you guys got to get out of there.

4711
05:18:29.52 --> 05:18:33.52
You're, you have an ex-filled bird.

4712
05:18:33.52 --> 05:18:35.52
That's coming to get you.

4713
05:18:35.52 --> 05:18:44.52
And it ends up making emergency landing in Pakistan and it can't quite make it to pick you up, which I find very, very suspect.

4714
05:18:44.52 --> 05:18:52.52
So you, eventually you have to hit your right out of there and you got to hit your right out of there with the military.

4715
05:18:52.52 --> 05:18:58.52
I got to read this section, uh, as you're looking for someone to give you a ride. Here we go.

4716
05:18:58.52 --> 05:19:00.52
Every lead we run down comes up short.

4717
05:19:00.52 --> 05:19:02.52
The military birds are full.

4718
05:19:02.52 --> 05:19:05.52
As are the state department birds.

4719
05:19:05.52 --> 05:19:08.52
I begin to wonder if we're going to have to walk out of this place.

4720
05:19:08.52 --> 05:19:12.52
If we have to, at least I know this is the team to do it with.

4721
05:19:12.52 --> 05:19:14.52
Still, I'd rather not.

4722
05:19:14.52 --> 05:19:17.52
Finally, I find an airman that recognizes me.

4723
05:19:17.52 --> 05:19:18.52
Oh, shit.

4724
05:19:18.52 --> 05:19:20.52
Are you Tim Kennedy, yes?

4725
05:19:20.52 --> 05:19:24.52
He is Tim Kennedy, see spray answers with a smirk.

4726
05:19:24.52 --> 05:19:25.52
Awesome man.

4727
05:19:25.52 --> 05:19:26.52
I'm a huge fan.

4728
05:19:26.52 --> 05:19:30.52
My new airman friend says, me too, see spray chimes.

4729
05:19:30.52 --> 05:19:32.52
Ignoring him.

4730
05:19:32.52 --> 05:19:35.52
I ask is there any chance you could have some room for us?

4731
05:19:35.52 --> 05:19:37.52
Are ride crashed in Pakistan?

4732
05:19:37.52 --> 05:19:38.52
No shit.

4733
05:19:38.52 --> 05:19:39.52
How many of you are there?

4734
05:19:39.52 --> 05:19:40.52
Four?

4735
05:19:40.52 --> 05:19:42.52
Yes, I just for a bus, I answer.

4736
05:19:42.52 --> 05:19:44.52
Hey, did you know he's Tim Kennedy?

4737
05:19:44.52 --> 05:19:45.52
He's patch.

4738
05:19:45.52 --> 05:19:48.52
He hasn't, in fact, Tim Kennedy.

4739
05:19:48.52 --> 05:19:50.52
Sean G says, joining in the game.

4740
05:19:50.52 --> 05:19:52.52
David, at least just smiles.

4741
05:19:52.52 --> 05:19:53.52
I can put you on the ramp man.

4742
05:19:53.52 --> 05:19:54.52
No problem.

4743
05:19:54.52 --> 05:19:56.52
My airman buddy tells us, you're the shit.

4744
05:19:56.52 --> 05:19:57.52
I really appreciate it.

4745
05:19:57.52 --> 05:19:58.52
I said, then add.

4746
05:19:58.52 --> 05:19:59.52
So where are we going?

4747
05:19:59.52 --> 05:20:00.52
Cotar.

4748
05:20:00.52 --> 05:20:01.52
He tells us.

4749
05:20:01.52 --> 05:20:02.52
Looks like we're going to Qatar.

4750
05:20:02.52 --> 05:20:04.52
I jump on the signal app and type.

4751
05:20:04.52 --> 05:20:06.52
Found a ride to Qatar.

4752
05:20:06.52 --> 05:20:08.52
We'll touch base when we land.

4753
05:20:08.52 --> 05:20:10.52
Communications now complete.

4754
05:20:10.52 --> 05:20:14.52
I shut my phone off to save battery and walk to the edge of the ramp.

4755
05:20:14.52 --> 05:20:19.52
I turned to look one last time at the vastness of the Afghan landscape.

4756
05:20:19.52 --> 05:20:22.52
I've left so much of my life in this place.

4757
05:20:22.52 --> 05:20:24.52
A lot of Americans died here.

4758
05:20:24.52 --> 05:20:26.52
Hell, I almost died here.

4759
05:20:26.52 --> 05:20:28.52
Was it worth it?

4760
05:20:28.52 --> 05:20:32.52
It's dark now, but I can still see the edges of the mountains against the night sky.

4761
05:20:32.52 --> 05:20:36.52
A feeling of sadness and failure encompasses me.

4762
05:20:36.52 --> 05:20:38.52
I might never be here again.

4763
05:20:38.52 --> 05:20:40.52
I walk up the ramp.

4764
05:20:48.52 --> 05:20:50.52
That's how you wrap up.

4765
05:20:50.52 --> 05:20:52.52
10 days, constant operations.

4766
05:20:52.52 --> 05:21:00.52
Like we said, you and your team secured vetted and evacuated 12,000 people.

4767
05:21:00.52 --> 05:21:04.52
American citizens, permanent residents, Afghan allies, Afghan refugees.

4768
05:21:04.52 --> 05:21:12.52
This is like 10-over 10% of the total people evacuated in this.

4769
05:21:12.52 --> 05:21:18.52
Just like work, incredible work.

4770
05:21:18.52 --> 05:21:26.52
Yeah, those are Dave and Sean G, Sean Gs, the ground force commander and C-spray.

4771
05:21:26.52 --> 05:21:30.52
I don't know, again, divine intervention.

4772
05:21:30.52 --> 05:21:34.52
Like Mike pushing me that time or,

4773
05:21:34.52 --> 05:21:40.52
cumumatively, that group, their individual experiences combined.

4774
05:21:40.52 --> 05:21:44.52
That the aggregate of the four of us who we were, the three of them,

4775
05:21:44.52 --> 05:21:48.52
they could have ruled that country.

4776
05:21:48.52 --> 05:21:52.52
That is the amount of brilliance that was cease-spray and Sean G in Dave.

4777
05:21:52.52 --> 05:21:56.52
That truly, three of the most intelligent humans I've ever met.

4778
05:21:56.52 --> 05:22:06.52
And selfless operators that, you know, the expeditionary mind of being able to look at a problem in this asymmetrical way.

4779
05:22:06.52 --> 05:22:14.52
And problem-solve is a really unique thing in an environment like the fall of Afghanistan.

4780
05:22:14.52 --> 05:22:18.52
You know, they're in the center of gravity and they are pulling strings.

4781
05:22:18.52 --> 05:22:22.52
They're calling generals. They're buying, like let's buy a bus.

4782
05:22:22.52 --> 05:22:26.52
Yeah, let's buy, let's buy seven buses and put them out here.

4783
05:22:26.52 --> 05:22:30.52
Let's buy an airline. Who sits there's like, let's buy an airline.

4784
05:22:30.52 --> 05:22:36.52
Let's cool. We'll tell the pilots that they'll get their families out if they fly for us.

4785
05:22:36.52 --> 05:22:38.52
It's a different kind of brain.

4786
05:22:38.52 --> 05:22:40.52
And that's who these three, these three men are.

4787
05:22:40.52 --> 05:22:44.52
They're the most amazing men to ever walk the face of this planet.

4788
05:22:44.52 --> 05:22:46.52
It's awesome too.

4789
05:22:46.52 --> 05:22:48.52
And you talk about this in the book.

4790
05:22:48.52 --> 05:22:54.52
Basically that you, and it's applies to all of them.

4791
05:22:54.52 --> 05:22:58.52
But all of you were like, none of us like, hey, I'm in charge.

4792
05:22:58.52 --> 05:23:00.52
No, I'm in charge. No, we should do it my way.

4793
05:23:00.52 --> 05:23:04.52
You guys are all just humble. Like, what's the best solution? How can we move forward?

4794
05:23:04.52 --> 05:23:08.52
And that place, such a key role. Like you can't, you can't like argue about dumb shit,

4795
05:23:08.52 --> 05:23:12.52
ego shit when you're trying to actually make things happen and don't work.

4796
05:23:12.52 --> 05:23:20.52
So there's not a time for it. And there's a consequence for it when it does happen.

4797
05:23:20.52 --> 05:23:26.52
And those men are still doing the work. Like right now as you and I are talking.

4798
05:23:26.52 --> 05:23:30.52
You know, we're operating other theaters.

4799
05:23:30.52 --> 05:23:36.52
And if you can smuggle people out, you have the same thing in that expeditionary mind to smuggle things in.

4800
05:23:36.52 --> 05:23:38.52
And we're doing everything that we can.

4801
05:23:38.52 --> 05:23:44.52
Like the mission statement of Savor allies, it's it's warren torn countries that need help.

4802
05:23:44.52 --> 05:23:46.52
That's, you know, whether it's humanitarian aid or evacuation.

4803
05:23:46.52 --> 05:23:50.52
It's rescuing of Americans, you know, saving our allies.

4804
05:23:50.52 --> 05:23:52.52
It's not a misnomer. It's exactly what we're doing.

4805
05:23:52.52 --> 05:23:57.52
And, you know, and it's like sheeped our response, you know, the purpose of global.

4806
05:23:57.52 --> 05:23:59.52
Yeah, global response.

4807
05:23:59.52 --> 05:24:01.52
We are a global organization.

4808
05:24:01.52 --> 05:24:04.52
Save our allies dot org.

4809
05:24:04.52 --> 05:24:09.52
Or, that's it. If you want to support a sheep dog response, a worldwide global.

4810
05:24:09.52 --> 05:24:10.52
Yeah, that's what's happening there.

4811
05:24:10.52 --> 05:24:14.52
I want to read one last section here from the book.

4812
05:24:14.52 --> 05:24:19.52
Just to close out this part of the book or just to close out from the book.

4813
05:24:19.52 --> 05:24:21.52
This is as you're flying home.

4814
05:24:21.52 --> 05:24:23.52
You're, you're on this aircraft.

4815
05:24:23.52 --> 05:24:28.52
And you start reflecting on things from a broad perspective.

4816
05:24:28.52 --> 05:24:33.52
And you say this, I think about my own trials and the scars that came with them.

4817
05:24:33.52 --> 05:24:36.52
My thoughts finally land on the moment.

4818
05:24:36.52 --> 05:24:38.52
All those years ago, standing on that beach.

4819
05:24:38.52 --> 05:24:41.52
I had failures stacked against me.

4820
05:24:41.52 --> 05:24:47.52
Two women pregnant, possible HIV, kicked off the police force, and a host of other problems.

4821
05:24:47.52 --> 05:24:50.52
It seemed like the end of the world.

4822
05:24:50.52 --> 05:24:54.52
Those challenges seemed impossible to overcome.

4823
05:24:54.52 --> 05:24:58.52
Now, that night in the ocean is a blip on the radar.

4824
05:24:58.52 --> 05:25:05.52
It doesn't matter except as the impetus to finally get off my ass and attack life.

4825
05:25:05.52 --> 05:25:09.52
Those two pregnant women gave me Sabrina and Julia.

4826
05:25:09.52 --> 05:25:12.52
My first two reasons to be a better man.

4827
05:25:12.52 --> 05:25:17.52
Those girls have given me nothing but joy and pride.

4828
05:25:17.52 --> 05:25:22.52
Being kicked off the force created a situation where I had to come to terms with my shortcomings.

4829
05:25:22.52 --> 05:25:25.52
I didn't fail because life was unfair.

4830
05:25:25.52 --> 05:25:30.52
I failed because I was a cocky asshole who made poor decisions.

4831
05:25:30.52 --> 05:25:33.52
Without that failure, I would never be a green beret.

4832
05:25:33.52 --> 05:25:35.52
I never would have found my calling.

4833
05:25:35.52 --> 05:25:38.52
I never would have reached my potential.

4834
05:25:38.52 --> 05:25:42.52
Thank God for those failures and that night.

4835
05:25:42.52 --> 05:25:48.52
The guy standing on that beach looked at life as a scorecard that you went or lose.

4836
05:25:48.52 --> 05:25:52.52
He thought failure was the end.

4837
05:25:52.52 --> 05:25:55.52
He was an idiot.

4838
05:25:55.52 --> 05:26:00.52
The guy and I rack who got beaten up for not being a team player couldn't have succeeded in the rescue effort.

4839
05:26:00.52 --> 05:26:02.52
I just undertook with this amazing team.

4840
05:26:02.52 --> 05:26:09.52
He would have wanted to lead it to show everyone how good he was instead of contributing to the group effort.

4841
05:26:09.52 --> 05:26:11.52
He was an idiot.

4842
05:26:11.52 --> 05:26:14.52
But it's okay that he was an idiot.

4843
05:26:14.52 --> 05:26:19.52
In the army, when you graduate from being a soldier to a non-commissioned officer,

4844
05:26:19.52 --> 05:26:22.52
you were in the title of Sergeant.

4845
05:26:22.52 --> 05:26:25.52
In that moment, you earn your stripes.

4846
05:26:25.52 --> 05:26:29.52
The upward facing rockers that you affixed to your uniform.

4847
05:26:29.52 --> 05:26:34.52
Those stripes are the symbol that shows you are a leader.

4848
05:26:34.52 --> 05:26:39.52
That you assume responsibility for yourself and those around you.

4849
05:26:39.52 --> 05:26:42.52
It took me a lot to get there.

4850
05:26:42.52 --> 05:26:44.52
It's been a hard road.

4851
05:26:44.52 --> 05:26:48.52
And every step of the way, every additional rank, every additional accomplishment,

4852
05:26:48.52 --> 05:26:52.52
every great success has required more of me.

4853
05:26:52.52 --> 05:26:59.52
I've had to sacrifice more, suffer more, and yes, fail more.

4854
05:26:59.52 --> 05:27:01.52
Failure isn't final.

4855
05:27:01.52 --> 05:27:02.52
It's necessary.

4856
05:27:02.52 --> 05:27:06.52
It's the fuel that allows you to advance to succeed.

4857
05:27:06.52 --> 05:27:12.52
To earn those stripes, you need to earn those scars first.

4858
05:27:12.52 --> 05:27:17.52
I take a deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth,

4859
05:27:17.52 --> 05:27:20.52
pulling my stomach to the back of my spine.

4860
05:27:20.52 --> 05:27:23.52
My mind is calm now.

4861
05:27:23.52 --> 05:27:27.52
My eyes feel heavy, and I lean back into my seat.

4862
05:27:27.52 --> 05:27:31.52
When I wake up in Atlanta, it will be my birthday,

4863
05:27:31.52 --> 05:27:33.52
and I will be 42 years old.

4864
05:27:33.52 --> 05:27:35.52
I'm excited.

4865
05:27:35.52 --> 05:27:41.52
This is the beginning of a whole new, amazing year of failure

4866
05:27:41.52 --> 05:27:44.52
and suffering.

4867
05:27:44.52 --> 05:27:47.52
I can't wait to get started.

4868
05:27:47.52 --> 05:27:52.52
So there you go, man.

4869
05:27:52.52 --> 05:27:55.52
There it is.

4870
05:27:55.52 --> 05:28:00.52
Life is filled with failures and suffering for everybody.

4871
05:28:00.52 --> 05:28:05.52
You know, one of the things that I didn't read from the book,

4872
05:28:05.52 --> 05:28:10.52
you've got some kind of rules, and your number one rule,

4873
05:28:10.52 --> 05:28:13.52
page two of the book, number one rule, take accountability.

4874
05:28:13.52 --> 05:28:14.52
It's your fault.

4875
05:28:14.52 --> 05:28:15.52
Yeah.

4876
05:28:15.52 --> 05:28:16.52
I like that a lot.

4877
05:28:16.52 --> 05:28:18.52
Do you like that a lot?

4878
05:28:18.52 --> 05:28:20.52
I don't know where I got it.

4879
05:28:20.52 --> 05:28:21.52
It took a long time.

4880
05:28:21.52 --> 05:28:24.52
Why didn't you read that book in like 97?

4881
05:28:24.52 --> 05:28:28.52
It would have been really useful because I was the jackass that was a running around

4882
05:28:28.52 --> 05:28:31.52
playing with other people for doing dumb shit or dumb shit happening to me.

4883
05:28:31.52 --> 05:28:35.52
That's why, yeah, I'm taking ownership, taking accountability.

4884
05:28:35.52 --> 05:28:38.52
When you recognize and listen, you can't control everything,

4885
05:28:38.52 --> 05:28:42.52
but man, you can control a lot more than you think you can.

4886
05:28:42.52 --> 05:28:46.52
And what matters the most when you come up against these challenges is

4887
05:28:46.52 --> 05:28:51.52
how you respond to it, what you learn from it.

4888
05:28:51.52 --> 05:28:58.52
How can these sufferings and failures actually make me better?

4889
05:28:58.52 --> 05:29:00.52
And that's what it's about.

4890
05:29:00.52 --> 05:29:02.52
And that's what the book's about.

4891
05:29:02.52 --> 05:29:04.52
And that's what Tim Kennedy's about.

4892
05:29:04.52 --> 05:29:06.52
That's what I'm learning to be about.

4893
05:29:06.52 --> 05:29:12.52
There's a fine balance from wallowing in your failure and being defined by your failure

4894
05:29:12.52 --> 05:29:16.52
and then embracing it, recognizing it, learning from it and moving it on.

4895
05:29:16.52 --> 05:29:21.52
And I have wallowed in it clearly as I went for a drink,

4896
05:29:21.52 --> 05:29:24.52
swim through the cold icy waters of Morave,

4897
05:29:24.52 --> 05:29:27.52
and I've also not learned from it.

4898
05:29:27.52 --> 05:29:31.52
And somewhere in between there on that spectrum is where learning happens.

4899
05:29:31.52 --> 05:29:38.52
And I definitely like a bump or bowling ball going down the bumpers have been figuring it out.

4900
05:29:38.52 --> 05:29:42.52
So I think I got more failure and more suffering ahead of me.

4901
05:29:42.52 --> 05:29:43.52
Yeah.

4902
05:29:43.52 --> 05:29:45.52
That's how you get better man.

4903
05:29:45.52 --> 05:29:46.52
Here we go.

4904
05:29:46.52 --> 05:29:48.52
That's how you get better.

4905
05:29:48.52 --> 05:29:50.52
Well, I've had you in here for way too long.

4906
05:29:50.52 --> 05:29:51.52
I apologize.

4907
05:29:51.52 --> 05:29:54.52
Kerry, you got any final questions there?

4908
05:29:54.52 --> 05:29:56.52
No, no final questions.

4909
05:29:56.52 --> 05:29:58.52
We pretty well covered in fear of being.

4910
05:29:58.52 --> 05:30:01.52
We got we were kind of hard on the pain on this.

4911
05:30:01.52 --> 05:30:02.52
Yeah.

4912
05:30:02.52 --> 05:30:08.52
Tim, before we go to closing thoughts, so we got SaberAllies.org.

4913
05:30:08.52 --> 05:30:13.52
That's the main place to support that thing.

4914
05:30:13.52 --> 05:30:16.52
You're all over the place at Tim Kennedy.

4915
05:30:16.52 --> 05:30:17.52
MMA.

4916
05:30:17.52 --> 05:30:19.52
Yeah, all the socials.

4917
05:30:19.52 --> 05:30:21.52
I'm not out of care about that stuff.

4918
05:30:21.52 --> 05:30:24.52
If you're going to support us, you can follow me if you're going to

4919
05:30:24.52 --> 05:30:28.52
talk about shenanigans, but between shape, sugar, sheep dog response,

4920
05:30:28.52 --> 05:30:30.52
Apigee and save our allies.

4921
05:30:30.52 --> 05:30:33.52
So sheep dog response dot com dot com.

4922
05:30:33.52 --> 05:30:36.52
Apigee, cedarpark.org.org.

4923
05:30:36.52 --> 05:30:38.52
There you go.

4924
05:30:38.52 --> 05:30:39.52
Awesome stuff.

4925
05:30:39.52 --> 05:30:40.52
Yeah.

4926
05:30:40.52 --> 05:30:41.52
Any closing thoughts, brother?

4927
05:30:41.52 --> 05:30:42.52
Dot per se, you.

4928
05:30:42.52 --> 05:30:43.52
Right.

4929
05:30:43.52 --> 05:30:44.52
But per se your voice.

4930
05:30:44.52 --> 05:30:45.52
I appreciate what you do.

4931
05:30:45.52 --> 05:30:50.52
Not often enough to I think our people recognize for really the impact that they're having.

4932
05:30:50.52 --> 05:30:57.52
We have been bordering on a very dangerous direction.

4933
05:30:57.52 --> 05:31:02.52
I think our country and you and a handful of very few other men and women have been

4934
05:31:02.52 --> 05:31:05.52
voices of rational logic of like no man.

4935
05:31:05.52 --> 05:31:06.52
It's up to you.

4936
05:31:06.52 --> 05:31:08.52
You got to get to back to work.

4937
05:31:08.52 --> 05:31:09.52
So thank you first and foremost.

4938
05:31:09.52 --> 05:31:16.52
Thanks for being a voice of truth and being a voice to inspire people like me to

4939
05:31:16.52 --> 05:31:21.52
conclude me to go on.

4940
05:31:21.52 --> 05:31:23.52
Do good things.

4941
05:31:23.52 --> 05:31:26.52
Well, I certainly don't think Tim Kennedy needs much inspiration for anybody.

4942
05:31:26.52 --> 05:31:28.52
Man, awesome to see you again.

4943
05:31:28.52 --> 05:31:29.52
Thanks for coming on.

4944
05:31:29.52 --> 05:31:32.52
Thanks for your service and the army.

4945
05:31:32.52 --> 05:31:35.52
Thanks for your continued service with everything that you're doing.

4946
05:31:35.52 --> 05:31:40.52
I mean, it's just it's just outstanding to see everything you do to try and help.

4947
05:31:40.52 --> 05:31:42.52
Your community.

4948
05:31:42.52 --> 05:31:44.52
Your our country.

4949
05:31:44.52 --> 05:31:53.52
And people of the world, like I said globally, you're making an impact and it's just it's just outstanding to see you out there

4950
05:31:53.52 --> 05:31:54.52
making it happen, man.

4951
05:31:54.52 --> 05:31:58.52
Respect me in a bunch of people way smarter than me.

4952
05:31:58.52 --> 05:32:01.52
You know, I'm more than other their coat tails as they're dragging me along.

4953
05:32:01.52 --> 05:32:06.52
Well, we both have that benefit of being a being around a bunch of people that are a lot smarter than the two

4954
05:32:06.52 --> 05:32:07.52
Nuckle Dragors sit in here.

4955
05:32:07.52 --> 05:32:08.52
Awesome.

4956
05:32:08.52 --> 05:32:09.52
Thanks for coming back.

4957
05:32:09.52 --> 05:32:10.52
Thank you.

4958
05:32:10.52 --> 05:32:15.52
And with that, Tim Kennedy has left the building.

4959
05:32:15.52 --> 05:32:20.52
And I believe at this point in time, we are at the world record, Jockel Podcast.

4960
05:32:20.52 --> 05:32:23.52
We are at the record.

4961
05:32:23.52 --> 05:32:30.52
Well, I don't know, man, but that went by, you know, split second in my mind.

4962
05:32:30.52 --> 05:32:31.52
I don't know.

4963
05:32:31.52 --> 05:32:36.52
I could just talk and listen to Tim and talk with Tim and convert him for a really long time.

4964
05:32:36.52 --> 05:32:41.52
So I guess pushing six hours at this point is pretty awesome.

4965
05:32:41.52 --> 05:32:43.52
What a what a dude, man.

4966
05:32:43.52 --> 05:32:45.52
What a great dude.

4967
05:32:45.52 --> 05:32:48.52
And I guess we should try and keep this a little bit short.

4968
05:32:48.52 --> 05:32:50.52
I'm who's left out there.

4969
05:32:50.52 --> 05:32:51.52
Especially now that Tim's gone.

4970
05:32:51.52 --> 05:32:54.52
It was like, I've already pushed the limit.

4971
05:32:54.52 --> 05:32:56.52
You already pushed the limit boys.

4972
05:32:56.52 --> 05:32:58.52
You know, wrap it up quick.

4973
05:32:58.52 --> 05:33:05.52
One thing I will say about Tim is he has this kind of like disregard for, you know,

4974
05:33:05.52 --> 05:33:08.52
I don't know if it's like convention or not necessarily rules either.

4975
05:33:08.52 --> 05:33:13.52
But if Tim wants to go do something like Tim's going to go do it.

4976
05:33:13.52 --> 05:33:14.52
And it was just awesome.

4977
05:33:14.52 --> 05:33:19.52
Everything from him doing the MMA career while he was still in the service.

4978
05:33:19.52 --> 05:33:23.52
And then just, you know, everything that he's had a conviction to go do,

4979
05:33:23.52 --> 05:33:26.52
he's going to do a freaking guy's answer in the call of managers.

4980
05:33:26.52 --> 05:33:27.52
He's getting after it.

4981
05:33:27.52 --> 05:33:29.52
Yeah, such an awesome awesome.

4982
05:33:29.52 --> 05:33:34.52
And you know, like I read that last little rule of his take accountability for it.

4983
05:33:34.52 --> 05:33:35.52
It's your fault.

4984
05:33:35.52 --> 05:33:36.52
And you know, we kind of joked about it.

4985
05:33:36.52 --> 05:33:40.52
That's the, that's the concept of extreme ownership.

4986
05:33:40.52 --> 05:33:42.52
That's helped so many, so many people out there.

4987
05:33:42.52 --> 05:33:43.52
You know, so many people.

4988
05:33:43.52 --> 05:33:46.52
I mean, so many people.

4989
05:33:46.52 --> 05:33:48.52
I don't want to put a number on it.

4990
05:33:48.52 --> 05:33:52.52
But it is a lot of people that have contacted me and contacted

4991
05:33:52.52 --> 05:33:59.52
Lave and said, hey, that's what got me straightened out is when I realized

4992
05:33:59.52 --> 05:34:01.52
I needed to take extreme ownership.

4993
05:34:01.52 --> 05:34:03.52
I needed to take accountability for every kind of

4994
05:34:03.52 --> 05:34:04.52
accountability for everything.

4995
05:34:04.52 --> 05:34:05.52
It's all my fault.

4996
05:34:05.52 --> 05:34:09.52
That's such a great starting point for life.

4997
05:34:09.52 --> 05:34:15.52
And for someone like Tim, it obviously has had a huge impact when he started to take accountability

4998
05:34:15.52 --> 05:34:17.52
for his life and move it in the right direction.

4999
05:34:17.52 --> 05:34:24.52
And then he just turns into, you know, a damn what he say, a missile of some kind,

5000
05:34:24.52 --> 05:34:28.52
fire and forget, there's a way to say, you're a flesh missile.

5001
05:34:28.52 --> 05:34:31.52
You've got all kinds of stuff going on.

5002
05:34:31.52 --> 05:34:34.52
But what a great guy.

5003
05:34:34.52 --> 05:34:37.52
So you're in charge of your own life.

5004
05:34:37.52 --> 05:34:39.52
You're in charge of your own security, by the way.

5005
05:34:39.52 --> 05:34:42.52
So check out that cheap dog response.

5006
05:34:42.52 --> 05:34:45.52
Also get yourself in good physical condition.

5007
05:34:45.52 --> 05:34:48.52
You know, when you start talking about, when you start talking about this,

5008
05:34:48.52 --> 05:34:51.52
remember when he was talking about, you got to be ready for this.

5009
05:34:51.52 --> 05:34:53.52
What, what is this?

5010
05:34:53.52 --> 05:34:56.52
This could be so such a wide variety.

5011
05:34:56.52 --> 05:35:00.52
It could even be, oh, my kid fell down.

5012
05:35:00.52 --> 05:35:03.52
We're in the woods.

5013
05:35:03.52 --> 05:35:09.52
And, you know, he or she child banged their head and need to get to a doctor.

5014
05:35:09.52 --> 05:35:13.52
And we're two miles, you know, from the road.

5015
05:35:13.52 --> 05:35:14.52
And I got to go up hill.

5016
05:35:14.52 --> 05:35:15.52
And I got to carry him.

5017
05:35:15.52 --> 05:35:16.52
Yep.

5018
05:35:16.52 --> 05:35:18.52
Do are you in the physical condition to do that?

5019
05:35:18.52 --> 05:35:21.52
Because if you're not, that could be tragic.

5020
05:35:21.52 --> 05:35:24.52
I remember my wife got stung by the damn,

5021
05:35:24.52 --> 05:35:33.52
stingray and we were at a beach around San Diego that has a bunch of stairs to get up to

5022
05:35:33.52 --> 05:35:35.52
to get to the parking lot.

5023
05:35:35.52 --> 05:35:39.52
And my wife got stung and I just straight just buddy carried this roll.

5024
05:35:39.52 --> 05:35:41.52
I'm getting her to the aid station.

5025
05:35:41.52 --> 05:35:44.52
I was like boom, you know, just buddy carried her up those stairs.

5026
05:35:44.52 --> 05:35:46.52
But hey, that was just a stingray.

5027
05:35:46.52 --> 05:35:49.52
What if something, what if she had a femoral bleed and I had to get whatever.

5028
05:35:49.52 --> 05:35:51.52
Something crazy happened.

5029
05:35:51.52 --> 05:35:52.52
Yep.

5030
05:35:52.52 --> 05:35:57.52
So what are you going to do to be prepared for this when you don't even know what this is?

5031
05:35:57.52 --> 05:35:59.52
Well, let me tell you one thing, be physically prepared.

5032
05:35:59.52 --> 05:36:00.52
100%.

5033
05:36:00.52 --> 05:36:03.52
This and my mind represents stress.

5034
05:36:03.52 --> 05:36:06.52
Some sort of stress is going to be put on you.

5035
05:36:06.52 --> 05:36:08.52
And you got to be ready for that stress.

5036
05:36:08.52 --> 05:36:09.52
Yeah.

5037
05:36:09.52 --> 05:36:11.52
Physical stress, mental stress, whatever it is.

5038
05:36:11.52 --> 05:36:13.52
That's what this is going to be.

5039
05:36:13.52 --> 05:36:15.52
It's going to be a stress on your system.

5040
05:36:15.52 --> 05:36:16.52
Yep.

5041
05:36:16.52 --> 05:36:18.52
How is your system prepared to take care of that stress?

5042
05:36:18.52 --> 05:36:20.52
You know, that means you're working out.

5043
05:36:20.52 --> 05:36:21.52
That means you're doing your jitsu.

5044
05:36:21.52 --> 05:36:23.52
That means you're on jockelfield, jockelfield.com.

5045
05:36:23.52 --> 05:36:24.52
Get yourself some mulk.

5046
05:36:24.52 --> 05:36:31.52
Man, you can't understate the beauty of mulk.

5047
05:36:31.52 --> 05:36:38.52
The fact that you could have dessert, you can have a dessert of the legit dessert that you think my God.

5048
05:36:38.52 --> 05:36:39.52
This is good.

5049
05:36:39.52 --> 05:36:40.52
That's what I think.

5050
05:36:40.52 --> 05:36:47.52
When I drink mulk, I think, you know, this is a, you could, you could put it up next to a dam hog and does.

5051
05:36:47.52 --> 05:36:51.52
Baskin Robbins. What? What do you want to go toe to toe?

5052
05:36:51.52 --> 05:36:53.52
And this one is good for me.

5053
05:36:53.52 --> 05:36:55.52
Do you track protein?

5054
05:36:55.52 --> 05:36:58.52
Do you track any like, no, you don't do any track and everything like that.

5055
05:36:58.52 --> 05:37:02.52
I was curious, you know, this started a month or two ago.

5056
05:37:02.52 --> 05:37:06.52
I was talking to JP to know about it too because he gets, he gets the protein.

5057
05:37:06.52 --> 05:37:08.52
You know, and I was, I was curious.

5058
05:37:08.52 --> 05:37:12.52
I was like, I know what I should be getting in terms of like grams of protein a day.

5059
05:37:12.52 --> 05:37:15.52
And I just didn't know where I was following.

5060
05:37:15.52 --> 05:37:19.52
So I tracked it and I was coming up short, coming up short.

5061
05:37:19.52 --> 05:37:20.52
I was coming up short, man.

5062
05:37:20.52 --> 05:37:23.52
And I, you know, you know, you got on that mulk.

5063
05:37:23.52 --> 05:37:24.52
I'm going to go to the life.

5064
05:37:24.52 --> 05:37:27.52
But why, why not have two mulk shakes a day for sure?

5065
05:37:27.52 --> 05:37:28.52
It makes sense.

5066
05:37:28.52 --> 05:37:31.52
It's, it's a, you know, a hundred calories of scoop or whatever.

5067
05:37:31.52 --> 05:37:34.52
You're getting 22 grams of protein to hit.

5068
05:37:34.52 --> 05:37:36.52
Like, you know, it's nice too.

5069
05:37:36.52 --> 05:37:37.52
It's a little pre-game.

5070
05:37:37.52 --> 05:37:41.52
You know, like, you, oh, you're going to go out to, you know, to a dinner, whatever.

5071
05:37:41.52 --> 05:37:43.52
Dinner, something with my wife.

5072
05:37:43.52 --> 05:37:45.52
You know, I'm going to some restaurant with some friends.

5073
05:37:45.52 --> 05:37:47.52
It's a Italian food.

5074
05:37:47.52 --> 05:37:49.52
You know, it's just there going to be throwing pasta at you.

5075
05:37:49.52 --> 05:37:50.52
What's up?

5076
05:37:50.52 --> 05:37:52.52
So it's like, you know, do a little pre-game.

5077
05:37:52.52 --> 05:37:54.52
Get that mulk hitter.

5078
05:37:54.52 --> 05:37:59.52
Because then instead of eating nine slices of freaking garlic bread in the openers, right?

5079
05:37:59.52 --> 05:38:00.52
You're good.

5080
05:38:00.52 --> 05:38:01.52
You don't need it because you're not hungry.

5081
05:38:01.52 --> 05:38:02.52
Right.

5082
05:38:02.52 --> 05:38:03.52
So you need to get the chicken parm.

5083
05:38:03.52 --> 05:38:06.52
Eat a couple of noodles just because of what's up, you know.

5084
05:38:06.52 --> 05:38:08.52
But try that pre-game.

5085
05:38:08.52 --> 05:38:11.52
It doesn't necessarily have to be a post-game evolution.

5086
05:38:11.52 --> 05:38:13.52
That is right there.

5087
05:38:13.52 --> 05:38:15.52
I'm going to try to jazz them over a little bit.

5088
05:38:15.52 --> 05:38:16.52
Jockelfield.com.

5089
05:38:16.52 --> 05:38:18.52
Mulk, joint warfare.

5090
05:38:18.52 --> 05:38:19.52
Super cruel.

5091
05:38:19.52 --> 05:38:20.52
All that stuff, immunity.

5092
05:38:20.52 --> 05:38:22.52
Don't get about the ghost.

5093
05:38:22.52 --> 05:38:24.52
Ghost, new flavor formulation.

5094
05:38:24.52 --> 05:38:25.52
Just coming down.

5095
05:38:25.52 --> 05:38:25.52
Yeah.

5096
05:38:25.52 --> 05:38:28.52
They're speaking of ownership.

5097
05:38:28.52 --> 05:38:30.52
As we know, my fault.

5098
05:38:30.52 --> 05:38:35.52
The original flavors weren't quite for the normal human.

5099
05:38:35.52 --> 05:38:37.52
They were for me.

5100
05:38:37.52 --> 05:38:43.52
But we fixed them. All the flavors are insanely delicious, insanely delicious.

5101
05:38:43.52 --> 05:38:46.52
I know it's getting good if everyone runs for their money with the new flavors,

5102
05:38:46.52 --> 05:38:47.52
DAX Advage.

5103
05:38:47.52 --> 05:38:48.52
Dakota Meyer.

5104
05:38:48.52 --> 05:38:56.52
The new DAX Advage is one of the best beverages I've ever tasted in my life.

5105
05:38:56.52 --> 05:39:00.52
So the Jockelfield guys rolled into the last mustard.

5106
05:39:00.52 --> 05:39:01.52
Main tie.

5107
05:39:01.52 --> 05:39:02.52
Justin over there.

5108
05:39:02.52 --> 05:39:03.52
Jockelfield.

5109
05:39:03.52 --> 05:39:05.52
They rolled in new flavor formulations.

5110
05:39:05.52 --> 05:39:10.52
Some of the mustard attendees got a little sneak peek of what's coming.

5111
05:39:10.52 --> 05:39:15.52
I didn't try the DAX Advage and now I'm kicking myself because I want to see what that's.

5112
05:39:15.52 --> 05:39:17.52
They're all unbelievably good.

5113
05:39:17.52 --> 05:39:18.52
The DAX Advage.

5114
05:39:18.52 --> 05:39:23.52
Maybe I was just surprised that it was so good and that the flavor, the way they nailed it,

5115
05:39:23.52 --> 05:39:25.52
it's going to be so it's so good.

5116
05:39:25.52 --> 05:39:26.52
And they're out.

5117
05:39:26.52 --> 05:39:33.52
So anyways, if you need some of that clean energy, clean energy, good and for you.

5118
05:39:33.52 --> 05:39:36.52
We don't need to do crystal meth and fedemine to get energy.

5119
05:39:36.52 --> 05:39:41.52
You don't need to do 378 milligrams of caffeine.

5120
05:39:41.52 --> 05:39:44.52
You don't need a bunch of 32 grams of sugar.

5121
05:39:44.52 --> 05:39:47.52
You don't need chemicals at all.

5122
05:39:47.52 --> 05:39:49.52
You can just get on that on that discipline.

5123
05:39:49.52 --> 05:39:50.52
Go try it.

5124
05:39:50.52 --> 05:39:53.52
Not only is good not bad for you.

5125
05:39:53.52 --> 05:39:54.52
It is good for you.

5126
05:39:54.52 --> 05:39:56.52
It is good for you.

5127
05:39:56.52 --> 05:39:58.52
Jockelfield.com.

5128
05:39:58.52 --> 05:39:59.52
OriginUSA.com.

5129
05:39:59.52 --> 05:40:01.52
If you need some American made clothing.

5130
05:40:01.52 --> 05:40:03.52
If you need some hunk gear, it's common.

5131
05:40:03.52 --> 05:40:06.52
You saw that first little saw that little visual.

5132
05:40:06.52 --> 05:40:08.52
Is that what's coming out first?

5133
05:40:08.52 --> 05:40:11.52
That's will be the first item.

5134
05:40:11.52 --> 05:40:13.52
Yeah, that would be the, yeah, because those are getting ready.

5135
05:40:13.52 --> 05:40:15.52
That was like the test line.

5136
05:40:15.52 --> 05:40:17.52
That was the first one coming off the test line.

5137
05:40:17.52 --> 05:40:19.52
How sick was that?

5138
05:40:19.52 --> 05:40:20.52
Oh, so sick.

5139
05:40:20.52 --> 05:40:25.52
And that Tiger Stripe Camo is just, it owed to saga.

5140
05:40:25.52 --> 05:40:26.52
Oh, disog.

5141
05:40:26.52 --> 05:40:30.52
But also like obviously it's functional right and they're on the person.

5142
05:40:30.52 --> 05:40:33.52
There's science and peat and all those brains back there.

5143
05:40:33.52 --> 05:40:36.52
Like figuring out the function application.

5144
05:40:36.52 --> 05:40:39.52
But it is also just let you look in.

5145
05:40:39.52 --> 05:40:41.52
You know, like you see that pattern out.

5146
05:40:41.52 --> 05:40:43.52
And you recognize it immediately.

5147
05:40:43.52 --> 05:40:44.52
And what's up.

5148
05:40:44.52 --> 05:40:46.52
So Hans common.

5149
05:40:46.52 --> 05:40:49.52
Gitu gear, geese, rash guards, you know, whatever you need.

5150
05:40:49.52 --> 05:40:51.52
Whatever you need boots, you need boots.

5151
05:40:51.52 --> 05:40:52.52
We got you.

5152
05:40:52.52 --> 05:40:53.52

We got you.

5154
05:40:54.52 --> 05:40:57.52
Jeans are always getting a little incrementally better, too.

5155

The jeans we are learning.

5156
05:40:59.52 --> 05:41:04.52

Application exercises.

5224
05:43:45.52 --> 05:43:47.52
It is a way for...

5225
05:43:47.52 --> 05:43:49.52
Listen, leadership is a skill.

5226
05:43:49.52 --> 05:43:52.52
Just like shooting is a skill.

5227
05:43:52.52 --> 05:43:55.52
Just like fighting and GJ2 is a skill.

5228
05:43:55.52 --> 05:43:58.52
You can't expect to get good at GJ2 without doing it.

5229
05:43:58.52 --> 05:44:00.52
You can't expect to get good at fighting without doing it.

5230
05:44:00.52 --> 05:44:03.52
You can't expect to be a good shot without learning how to shoot.

5231
05:44:03.52 --> 05:44:05.52
It's a skill set.

5232
05:44:05.52 --> 05:44:06.52
So is leadership.

5233
05:44:06.52 --> 05:44:09.52
So since it is a skill set that you need to learn.

5234
05:44:09.52 --> 05:44:10.52

I'm at Jocca Willing.

5288
05:46:13.52 --> 05:46:14.52
Were you at Kda.

5289
05:46:14.52 --> 05:46:16.52
Carry underscore health.

5290
05:46:16.52 --> 05:46:18.52
Is that the best you could do?

5291
05:46:18.52 --> 05:46:19.52
You had a phone underscore in there.

5292
05:46:19.52 --> 05:46:20.52
Yeah.

5293
05:46:20.52 --> 05:46:21.52
Yeah.

5294
05:46:21.52 --> 05:46:22.52
We covered.

5295
05:46:22.52 --> 05:46:23.52
There's already a Kda.

5296
05:46:23.52 --> 05:46:24.52
Yeah.

5297
05:46:24.52 --> 05:46:25.52
There's a carry held out there.

5298
05:46:25.52 --> 05:46:28.52
And I tried to message him and no response.

5299
05:46:28.52 --> 05:46:30.52
Just leaving me out to dry.

5300
05:46:30.52 --> 05:46:33.52
So I guess we're going underscore going underscore.

5301
05:46:33.52 --> 05:46:35.52
Carry underscore help.

5302
05:46:35.52 --> 05:46:37.52
Hey, when you're getting on there,

5303
05:46:37.52 --> 05:46:38.52

5304
05:46:38.52 --> 05:46:39.52
Cool.

We appreciate it.

5306
05:46:40.52 --> 05:46:41.52
Dude, I'm going to tell you right now.

5307
05:46:41.52 --> 05:46:45.52
The algorithms got it's got it's an offensive.

5308
05:46:45.52 --> 05:46:48.52
If that effective.

5309
05:46:48.52 --> 05:46:50.52
Cool.

5310
05:46:50.52 --> 05:46:55.52
That they're using to get in your head and steal your time from me from you.

5311
05:46:55.52 --> 05:46:59.52
I feel like if I'm on there, I feel like someone stealing my time from me.

5312
05:46:59.52 --> 05:47:01.52
I feel like, oh, they're getting me right now.

5313
05:47:01.52 --> 05:47:03.52
So look, come on.

5314
05:47:03.52 --> 05:47:04.52
Check in.

5315
05:47:04.52 --> 05:47:05.52
That's cool.

5316
05:47:05.52 --> 05:47:06.52
Throw a comment.

5317
05:47:06.52 --> 05:47:07.52
Whatever.

5318
05:47:07.52 --> 05:47:08.52
Do not.

5319
05:47:08.52 --> 05:47:12.52
Get caught in the algorithm.

5320
05:47:12.52 --> 05:47:14.52
So that's that.

5321
05:47:14.52 --> 05:47:19.52
Once again, thanks to Tim Kennedy for everything that he has done.

5322
05:47:19.52 --> 05:47:22.52
He is doing just an awesome human.

5323
05:47:22.52 --> 05:47:25.52
And, you know, is he a perfect human?

5324
05:47:25.52 --> 05:47:26.52
He's not a perfect human.

5325
05:47:26.52 --> 05:47:27.52
None of us are.

5326
05:47:27.52 --> 05:47:32.52
But talk about squared away trajectory.

5327
05:47:32.52 --> 05:47:35.52
It's just inspiring to be around him.

5328
05:47:35.52 --> 05:47:38.52
So thanks Tim.

5329
05:47:38.52 --> 05:47:40.52
Once again for everything you're doing and everything you've done.

5330
05:47:40.52 --> 05:47:45.52
And thanks to all the folks that are in uniform right now out there in the world.

5331
05:47:45.52 --> 05:47:50.52
Standing the watch protecting freedom, protecting our way of life.

5332
05:47:50.52 --> 05:47:53.52
Thank you to all of you in uniform.

5333
05:47:53.52 --> 05:47:55.52
And the same goes to our police and law enforcement.

5334
05:47:55.52 --> 05:48:00.52
Firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correction officers, boarder patrol.

5335
05:48:00.52 --> 05:48:03.52
See we're service and all the first responders out there.

5336
05:48:03.52 --> 05:48:06.52
Thank you all for standing watch.

5337
05:48:06.52 --> 05:48:07.52
Here at home.

5338
05:48:07.52 --> 05:48:10.52
And we got to hear some stories of what it's like for an EMT.

5339
05:48:10.52 --> 05:48:12.52
What it's like for a firefighter.

5340
05:48:12.52 --> 05:48:13.52
What it's like for police.

5341
05:48:13.52 --> 05:48:15.52
What they see every day.

5342
05:48:15.52 --> 05:48:20.52
Thanks to you all and to everybody else out there.

5343
05:48:20.52 --> 05:48:24.52
Just remember where Tim was at.

5344
05:48:24.52 --> 05:48:29.52
Remember what Tim went through.

5345
05:48:29.52 --> 05:48:30.52
He was in a rough place.

5346
05:48:30.52 --> 05:48:33.52
Man, he'd been a firefighter.

5347
05:48:33.52 --> 05:48:34.52
Fireed.

5348
05:48:34.52 --> 05:48:38.52
He had his hopes of dreams of becoming a police officer.

5349
05:48:38.52 --> 05:48:42.52
Had those dreams squashed.

5350
05:48:42.52 --> 05:48:45.52
He had a bunch of problems going on.

5351
05:48:45.52 --> 05:48:48.52
And he was using a rough spot.

5352
05:48:48.52 --> 05:48:51.52
He's ready to call it quits.

5353
05:48:51.52 --> 05:48:53.52
But he didn't.

5354
05:48:53.52 --> 05:48:55.52
He took accountability for his actions.

5355
05:48:55.52 --> 05:48:56.52
He learned.

5356
05:48:56.52 --> 05:48:57.52
He grew.

5357
05:48:57.52 --> 05:48:59.52
He worked hard.

5358
05:48:59.52 --> 05:49:01.52
He got a lot of good stuff.

5359
05:49:01.52 --> 05:49:02.52
He learned.

5360
05:49:02.52 --> 05:49:03.52
He turned his life around.

5361
05:49:03.52 --> 05:49:06.52
And now he's out there helping others do the same.

5362
05:49:06.52 --> 05:49:08.52
So no matter what happens.

5363
05:49:08.52 --> 05:49:11.52
Don't ever give up.

5364
05:49:11.52 --> 05:49:14.52
Don't stop moving forward.

5365
05:49:14.52 --> 05:49:19.52
And instead embrace those scars.

5366
05:49:19.52 --> 05:49:22.52
And look from them.

5367
05:49:22.52 --> 05:49:24.52
Can't go conquer.

5368
05:49:24.52 --> 05:49:28.52
And until next time, this is Kerry and Jocco.

5369
05:49:28.52 --> 05:49:29.52
Out.
